NA,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,15
NA,World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation,15
Mr ROBB ,Goldstein-Minister for Trade and Investment) (09:01): by leave-It is with,15
NA,pleasure that I table the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation and,15
NA,accompanying national interest analysis for parliament's consideration. The agreement on,15
NA,trade facilitation was concluded by the 159 members of the WTO at the Ninth Ministerial,15
NA,"Conference on 7 December 2013 in Bali. As with all proposed treaties, the parliament's Joint",15
NA,"Standing Committee on Treaties will now review the agreement and, in due course, provide",15
NA,its report.,15
NA,This agreement is designed to deliver practical measures to strengthen global trade and,15
NA,"economic growth. At its heart, this agreement is about cutting red tape. It is about removing",15
NA,the regulatory and procedural burdens that our traders face when conducting international,15
NA,trade.,15
NA,As the agreement targets regulatory barriers and border bottlenecks often overlooked in,15
NA,"international trade negotiations, the benefits to Australia will be significant. With its focus on",15
NA,harmonising and streamlining global customs procedures the agreement will markedly reduce,15
NA,the length of time and the number of documents it takes Australian exporters to get their,15
NA,"goods across borders. By requiring more transparent and predictable regulations, the",15
NA,"agreement will also assist Australian businesses, large and small, in making international",15
NA,business decisions.,15
NA,"For Australian exporters, implementation of the agreement will mean marked",15
NA,improvements in the manner in which their goods are treated in offshore markets. In fact it,15
NA,has been estimated that full implementation of the agreement could reduce the costs of trading,15
NA,"across borders by up to 10 per cent for Australian traders. For example, provisions on advance",15
NA,rulings will mean that Australian traders will be able to obtain precise and binding rulings on,15
NA,the tariff classification their good will receive upon arrival at a foreign border. This will help,15
NA,"Australia's smaller exporters in particular, who will know how their goods will be treated by",15
NA,an overseas customs authority before sending them off on the long voyage from Australia.,15
NA,"The agreement also mandates the quick release of perishable goods, which will reduce the",15
NA,number of Australian agricultural exports left to rot while waiting for clearance in foreign,15
NA,ports. Provisions allowing for the submission of import documentation prior to the physical,15
NA,"arrival of goods, and for the clearance of goods prior to the final determination of duties and",15
NA,"charges, will speed up the process of getting Australian goods to market. This will reduce",15
NA,business costs for Australian exporters and make their goods more affordable to overseas,15
NA,consumers.,15
NA,Small Australian exporters will also benefit from new requirements to publish relevant,15
NA,procedures and forms for importing goods on the internet. This simple but highly valuable,15
NA,NA,15
NA,commitment from WTO members will make it much easier for our SMEs to navigate customs,16
NA,procedures and launch themselves into new export markets.,16
NA,"The agreement complements our efforts in development assistance, and will deliver",16
NA,substantial benefits to our developing country partners. The full implementation of the,16
NA,agreement by developing countries will boost their economic growth and create millions of,16
NA,"jobs. Globally, the agreement will provide a major boost for jobs and growth, and it has been",16
NA,estimated that this agreement could add up to US$1 trillion to the world economy and create,16
NA,21 million jobs. We stand ready to assist developing countries to implement the agreement,16
NA,and to undertake the necessary reforms to facilitate trade. We are already providing assistance,16
NA,"of this nature, including to our Pacific Island neighbours. More recently, and in partnership",16
NA,"with the World Bank, we have committed to support global efforts to help developing country",16
NA,partners undertake trade facilitation reform.,16
NA,"As the first major agreement concluded since the establishment of the WTO in 1995, the",16
NA,Agreement on Trade Facilitation is a significant milestone. It shows that the multilateral,16
NA,trading system is continuing to deliver outcomes with significant benefits and global reach.,16
NA,Australia remains committed to advancing WTO negotiations to bring the Doha Round to a,16
NA,close. We are currently working with WTO Director-General Azevedo and other members to,16
NA,"develop a productive and forward looking post-Bali work plan, which will deliver economic",16
NA,growth and jobs for Australia.,16
NA,In just over a month I will chair the second G20 trade ministers meeting. One of the aims,16
NA,of the meeting will be for G20 member countries to identify actions to improve the efficiency,16
NA,"of trade flows within global value chains-that array of activities involved in creating,",16
NA,producing and delivering a product that stretch across countries and regions. Income from,16
NA,global value chain trade flows doubled between 1995 and 2009. I will be strongly,16
NA,encouraging my G20 colleagues to agree to implementation of the Agreement on Trade,16
NA,Facilitation quickly as an effective action towards harnessing the power of the global,16
NA,"economy, boosting trade and creating jobs.",16
NA,This government is committed to a trade agenda that increases the prosperity of,16
NA,Australians. Negotiating outcomes like the Agreement on Trade Facilitation will substantially,16
NA,"reduce trade barriers and minimise red tape, making a significant contribution to Australia's",16
NA,economic future. Australia's acceptance of this agreement will further build on the,16
NA,government's recent accomplishments in concluding free trade agreements with Korea and,16
NA,"Japan. We expect that upon the agreement's entry into force, we will see substantial benefits",16
NA,beginning to flow for Australian exporters from reduced red-tape at the borders of our key,16
NA,trading partners.,16
NA,"This is an agreement that took a long time to negotiate, and I commend the achievement of",16
NA,officials from various agencies led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I,16
NA,"commend this agreement to parliament, and hereby table the WTO Agreement on Trade",16
NA,Facilitation with its national interest analysis.,16
NA,I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,16
NA,to speak for six minutes.,16
NA,Leave granted.,16
Mr ROBB, I move:,16
NA,NA,16
NA,That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the,17
NA,Opposition speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding six minutes.,17
NA,Question agreed to.,17
Ms PLIBERSEK ,Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (09:08): Labor welcomes,17
NA,the finalisation of the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade Facilitation. We believe,17
NA,the trade is critical to Australia's future prosperity. Trade provides new markets and new,17
NA,"opportunities for our exporters. It boosts economic growth, it improves competition and it",17
NA,gives our consumers access to a wider range of goods at lower prices. This agreement builds,17
NA,on the work undertaken by the previous Labor government and our commitment to,17
NA,progressing the World Trade Organisation's Doha Round negotiations. We particularly,17
NA,welcome this agreement as the first major agreement concluded since the establishment of the,17
NA,WTO in 1995.,17
NA,This Agreement on Trade Facilitation will assist in removing red tape and other regulatory,17
NA,"and procedural burdens. It will streamline approvals and transactions for exporters,",17
NA,dismantling some of those barriers that exist behind a country's borders that can be hidden,17
NA,impediments for business. Estimates have previously suggested that this WTO Trade,17
NA,Facilitation Agreement will account for 44 per cent of the total prospective benefits of the,17
NA,"Doha Round, with two-thirds of these benefits accruing to developing countries.",17
NA,The benefits of this agreement to developing countries cannot be underestimated. Trade,17
NA,facilitation reform will boost economic growth and assist in the creation of millions of jobs,17
NA,for our developing country partners. Some of the important reforms contained in this,17
NA,"agreement will benefit our exporters, and they include, as the minister said, the harmonisation",17
NA,and streamlining of global customs procedures. This will assist exporters by reducing the,17
NA,"number of documents needed to be filled out to move their goods across borders. Also, very",17
NA,"importantly, the release of perishable goods will be welcomed by Australian exporters, who",17
NA,often face costly delays on agricultural exports while awaiting clearance on foreign wharves.,17
NA,"The minister noted that this is an agreement that took a long time to negotiate, and he",17
NA,congratulated the officials of the department. I add my congratulations to those officials. I,17
NA,"note with disappointment, though, the minister's failure to acknowledge the efforts of previous",17
NA,ministers who laid the groundwork required to deliver this outcome at the WTO's Bali,17
NA,"ministerial conference last December. In particular, Labor would place on record the",17
NA,important contribution made by the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former trade,17
NA,minister Craig Emerson set separate to the finalisation of this agreement. It was Craig,17
NA,Emerson's articulation of new pathways to the Doha mountain top which saw WTO members,17
NA,agree to divide up the Doha Round into separate negotiations. Prime Minister Gillard,17
NA,spearheaded this approach through the 2011 meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of,17
NA,"Government, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the G20 and the East Asia",17
NA,"Summit. The principle was eventually adopted by America, China and the World Trade",17
NA,Organization. It played an important role in reviving the momentum needed to bring this,17
NA,agreement on trade liberalisation to completion.,17
NA,"Labor would also like to acknowledge, as I said earlier, the efforts of officials of the",17
NA,Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in concluding this agreement. It would have been a,17
NA,"long haul for them, and we appreciate their efforts. We welcome the finalisation of this",17
NA,agreement and will review the treaty through the joint committee process over coming weeks.,17

NA,BILLS,18
NA,Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No.,18
NA,1) Bill 2014,18
NA,First Reading,18
NA,Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Andrews.,18
NA,Bill read a first time.,18
NA,Second Reading,18
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (09:13): I move:,18
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,18
NA,This bill introduces a package of measures from the 2014 budget in the Social Services,18
NA,portfolio.,18
NA,The 2014 budget is a key part of the government's Economic Action Strategy to build a,18
NA,"strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia.",18
NA,The government's welfare reforms encompassed in the budget are aimed at increasing,18
NA,"everyone's ability to contribute to the economy-everyone who can contribute, should",18
NA,contribute.,18
NA,"The government will continue to provide assistance for families, seniors, people with",18
NA,"disability, carers and those most in need. The 2014 budget includes $146 billion of welfare",18
NA,"spending-or 35 per cent of total budget expenditure. This includes pensions, family",18
NA,"payments, unemployment benefits and childcare support.",18
NA,"However, our population is ageing, and government spending has been growing faster than",18
NA,the economy. This is placing greater pressure on our welfare system. We want government,18
NA,"assistance to be targeted towards supporting the most vulnerable Australians, while",18
NA,"encouraging those who are able to work or study, to do so.",18
NA,Firm and decisive action is required to put the budget back onto a secure and sustainable,18
NA,footing.,18
NA,Budget measures,18
NA,Seniors supplement and energy supplement,18
NA,To help ensure that payments to senior Australians remain targeted to those who need them,18
NA,"the most, the first budget measure in the bill will cease the seniors supplement, currently",18
NA,received by holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (or the Veterans' Affairs Gold,18
NA,Card) after the June 2014 payment.,18
NA,"However, other benefits will continue to be available to cardholders, including discounts",18
NA,"on medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, health safety net thresholds, and",18
NA,lower fees on medical services.,18
NA,"Recognising the government's commitment to abolish the carbon tax, while keeping in",18
NA,"place the associated payment increases, this bill will rename the former clean energy",18
NA,"supplement as the energy supplement, and maintain it at current levels from 1 July 2014 by",18
NA,permanently removing indexation of the supplement.,18
NA,NA,18
NA,The new energy supplement will be available to people who formerly received the clean,19
NA,"energy supplement in association with their main income support payment, family payment or",19
NA,"veterans affairs payment, or through being a holder of the Commonwealth seniors health card",19
NA,or an eligible holder of the gold card.,19
NA,Indexation and rates,19
NA,Several changes and pauses to indexation for Australian government payments will be,19
NA,"implemented. These measures will help reduce our debt, but pausing indexation will not",19
NA,reduce payments.,19
NA,These measures include pausing indexation of the income and asset-free areas for all,19
NA,working age allowances (other than student payments) and for parenting payment single for,19
NA,three years from 1 July 2014.,19
NA,Family tax benefit income thresholds (for the maximum rate of family tax benefit part A,19
NA,and the lower income earner threshold for family tax benefit part B) will stay at current levels,19
NA,for three years from 1 July 2014.,19
NA,The bill will also ensure parenting payment single is indexed only against the consumer,19
NA,price index from 20 September 2014.,19
NA,Disability support pension,19
NA,The bill will also introduce changes to help young people with disability to enter the,19
NA,workforce if they are able to do so.,19
NA,"From 1 July 2014, certain disability support pension recipients aged under 35 will",19
NA,"undertake compulsory work focused activities, such as a program with an employment service",19
NA,"provider, work experience, or education and training, to help increase their chances of finding",19
NA,and keeping a job.,19
NA,A targeted review will also be undertaken of disability support pension recipients aged,19
NA,under 35 who originally accessed the payment under less rigorous impairment tables in,19
NA,operation between 2008 and 2011. Recipients will have their level of impairment reassessed,19
NA,"against the current impairment tables, and will also have their work capacity reassessed.",19
NA,People with a manifest disability or with a work capacity of zero to seven hours a week,19
NA,will not be reviewed under this measure. Recipients assessed as having an ability to work at,19
NA,least eight hours a week will be provided with the support needed to allow them to develop,19
NA,"their work capacity, while still receiving the disability support pension.",19
NA,Workforce age and student changes,19
NA,"As part of a package of changes to simplify the social security system, and strengthen the",19
NA,"incentives for young unemployed people to participate in education, training and",19
NA,"employment, the bill will apply the ordinary waiting period of seven days for all working age",19
NA,payments from 1 October 2014.,19
NA,"A further measure will ensure that, while a student can currently continue to receive",19
NA,"payment even while they are overseas on holiday, students will continue to receive payments",19
NA,"while overseas, from 1 October 2014, only in certain circumstances such as when studying or",19
NA,in a family emergency.,19
NA,NA,19
NA,Family payment reform,20
NA,Several reforms were announced in the budget to improve the sustainability of family,20
NA,"payments, while ensuring they continue to support those most in need of assistance.",20
NA,The government will continue to provide payment assistance to families to supplement,20
NA,"their incomes. In 2014-15, the government will provide around $19 billion in family tax",20
NA,"benefit. However, the payment should provide assistance to families who need it most, and",20
NA,"encourage everyone who can work, to do so.",20
NA,"Amendments in this bill, effective from 1 July 2014, will maintain the standard payment",20
NA,rates of family tax benefit parts A and B at current levels for two years until 30 June 2016.,20
NA,Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account,20
NA,The bill will also make a non-budget amendment to add the Western Australian Industrial,20
NA,Relations Commission decision of 29 August 2013 as a pay equity decision under the Social,20
NA,and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Act 2012. This amendment will allow,20
NA,payment of Commonwealth supplementation to service providers affected by that decision.,20
NA,Conclusion,20
NA,"Our welfare system must be sustainable and it must be fair. It needs to provide a safety net,",20
NA,"whilst ensuring we are delivering a work-ready, not a welfare-ready, nation.",20
NA,"Our welfare system is complicated and costly and, in the budget measures introduced by",20
NA,"this bill, we begin the work of making it strong for the future. I commend the bill to the",20
NA,House.,20
NA,Debate adjourned.,20
NA,Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No.,20
NA,2) Bill 2014,20
NA,First Reading,20
NA,Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Andrews.,20
NA,Bill read a first time.,20
NA,Second Reading,20
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (09:20): I move:,20
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,20
NA,This is the second bill in the Social Services portfolio to introduce measures from the 2014,20
NA,budget.,20
NA,"This second bill follows up the reforms to indexation and payment rates, supplements,",20
NA,"disability support pension, and student and workforce age payments already introduced in the",20
NA,Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014.,20
NA,Indexation and rates,20
NA,Several further changes and pauses to indexation and deemed income arrangements for,20
NA,Australian government payments will be introduced by this bill.,20
NA,"Indexation of the income and asset-free areas for student payments, and student income",20
NA,"bank limits, will be paused for three years from 1 January 2015.",20
NA,NA,20
NA,Indexation of the income and asset-free areas for all pensions (other than parenting,21
NA,"payment single), and the deeming thresholds for all income support payments, will be paused",21
NA,from 1 July 2017 for three years.,21
NA,The Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill,21
NA,2014 introduced amendments to ensure parenting payment single is indexed only against the,21
NA,consumer price index from 20 September 2014. This second budget bill will similarly ensure,21
NA,"that all other pensions are indexed only against the consumer price index, from the later date",21
NA,"of 20 September 2017. This will help ensure the age pension in particular is sustainable, while",21
NA,pensions generally still keep up with the cost of living.,21
NA,The government will also change the level of a person's financial assets at which a higher,21
NA,"return is deemed. From 20 September 2017, the social security and veterans' entitlements",21
NA,"income test deeming thresholds will be reset to $30,000 for single income support recipients,",21
NA,"and $50,000 combined for pensioner couples. The deeming threshold amount for a member of",21
NA,"a couple other than a pensioner couple will be $25,000.",21
NA,Disability support pension and carers,21
NA,"From 1 January 2015, recipients of the disability support pension who travel overseas for",21
NA,more than 28 days in a 12-month period will need to reapply for the payment on their return,21
NA,"to Australia. There will be some exemptions-for example, for people with terminal illness",21
NA,"who are returning to their country of origin to be with family, or people with permanent and",21
NA,severe disability and no future work capacity.,21
NA,This budget has delivered $3 million in funding to honour the government's election,21
NA,"commitment to set up the Young Carer Bursary Program, which will provide support for",21
NA,"young carers in Australia who look after people with disability, people with physical or",21
NA,"mental health issues, or older people in need of care.",21
NA,The responsibilities of young carers can have a significant impact on their personal lives,21
NA,and educational opportunities. The Young Carer Bursary Program will help reduce the,21
NA,financial burden on young carers by providing around 150 bursaries annually that will allow,21
NA,them to continue their studies.,21
NA,This bill will support the new program by excluding from the social security and veterans',21
NA,entitlements income test any payments made under the program from 1 January 2015.,21
NA,Commonwealth seniors health card,21
NA,A measure affecting the Commonwealth seniors health card will include untaxed,21
NA,superannuation income received in the form of an account-based income stream in the,21
NA,"assessment for the card. This will ensure people with similar incomes are treated consistently,",21
NA,whether they are being assessed for a payment such as the age pension or for the health card.,21
NA,Superannuation products purchased before 1 January 2015 by existing cardholders will be,21
NA,exempt from the new arrangements.,21
NA,"Related to this measure, holders of the commonwealth seniors health card will benefit from",21
NA,an extension from six to 19 weeks in the length of time they may be absent from Australia,21
NA,without having to reapply for the card on their return.,21
NA,NA,21
NA,Workforce age and student changes,22
NA,"From 1 January 2015, young unemployed people aged 22 to 24 will no longer be qualified",22
NA,"for Newstart allowance or sickness allowance, and instead will be able to qualify for youth",22
NA,allowance (student) or youth allowance (other) until they turn 25 years of age.,22
NA,"The changes simplify the social security system, and strengthen the incentives for young",22
NA,"unemployed people to participate in education, training and employment.",22
NA,A six-month waiting period and time-limited income support payments will give young,22
NA,people stronger incentives to earn or learn. Young people will have access to a full range of,22
NA,"supports to help them become work-ready, including employment services, training and",22
NA,"relocation assistance. Exemptions exist for those with limited capacity to work, who are",22
NA,"undergoing study, who have a significant disability, or who have parenting responsibilities.",22
NA,In recognition of the importance of education and training in preventing future,22
NA,"unemployment, young people returning to full-time school, vocational education or university",22
NA,will not be subject to the waiting period.,22
NA,"For every one year of work history, one month will be discounted from their waiting",22
NA,"period, pro-rated for part-time or casual work, to a maximum of five months' discount from",22
NA,the waiting period.,22
NA,"Also from 1 January 2015, the current relocation scholarship assistance for students",22
NA,"relocating within and between major cities will be removed, as will the education entry",22
NA,payment and the pensioner education supplement.,22
NA,Family payment reforms,22
NA,Several further reforms will be implemented from 1 July 2015 to improve the sustainability,22
NA,"of family payments, while ensuring they continue to support those most in need of assistance:",22
NA," The family tax benefit part B primary earner income limit will be reduced from $150,000",22
NA,"to $100,000. Families with primary earner income over $100,000 will not be eligible for",22
NA,family tax benefit part B.,22
NA," The large family supplement will also be better targeted, by being directed to families with",22
NA,four or more children.,22
NA, The family tax benefit parts A and B end-of-year supplements provide additional assistance,22
NA,at the end of the year when family tax benefit is reconciled against tax return incomes. The,22
NA,"supplements will be revised to their original values of $600 and $300, and indexation will",22
NA,cease.,22
NA, Payments of family tax benefit part B will be available to families until their youngest child,22
NA,turns six. Transitional arrangements will apply for two years to families already receiving,22
NA,the payment for children aged six and over.,22
NA, The government recognises that single parents have greater difficulties balancing work and,22
NA,caring for their children. This bill will provide low-income single parents with extra,22
NA,assistance of $750 a year. This will be provided to single parents on the maximum rate of,22
NA,"family tax benefit part A, and not receiving family tax benefit part B, for each child aged",22
NA,six to 12.,22
NA,NA,22
NA, The per-child add-on that currently applies for each child after the first under the income,23
NA,test for the base rate of family tax benefit part A will be removed.,23
NA,Pension age,23
NA,Building on the move by the former Labor government to increase the pension age to 67,23
NA,"from 1 July 2017, this bill will continue the gradual increase in the qualifying age for the age",23
NA,"pension, and the non-veteran pension age, to 70 by 1 July 2035. The bill does not change the",23
NA,pension age for veterans.,23
NA,"Australians are living longer, and our population is ageing. Between 2010 and 2050, the",23
NA,"number of people aged 65 to 84 will more than double, and those aged 85 and over will more",23
NA,than quadruple.,23
NA,"This will present challenges for economic growth, living standards and fiscal sustainability.",23
NA,The change in the pension age will encourage greater self-provision. Those who cannot fully,23
NA,"support themselves before pension age are protected by the social security safety net, subject",23
NA,to meeting relevant eligibility criteria.,23
NA,Veterans' Disability Pension,23
NA,"In the last budget measure, the bill will remove from 1 January 2015 the three months'",23
NA,backdating of disability pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.,23
NA,Conclusion,23
NA,The government is committed to ensuring our welfare system is sustainable and fair. I,23
NA,commend the bill to the House.,23
NA,Debate adjourned.,23
NA,National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2014,23
NA,First Reading,23
NA,Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton.,23
NA,Bill read a first time.,23
NA,Second Reading,23
Mr DUTTON ,Dickson-Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (09:30): I move:,23
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,23
NA,The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2014 implements the,23
NA,decision announced in the 2014-15 budget to increase patient co-payments and safety net,23
NA,thresholds for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and the Repatriation,23
NA,Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS).,23
NA,It is another example of this government's work to protect the best interests of Australians,23
NA,in making the decisions necessary to improve Australia's budget position into the future.,23
NA,The PBS and RPBS are key components of our health services and are a major investment,23
NA,"in the health of Australians. In the ten years to 2012-13, the cost of the PBS has increased by",23
NA,"80 per cent. At a current cost of around $9 billion per year, and with annual growth over the",23
NA,"longer term expected to be between four and five per cent, these schemes will not be",23
NA,sustainable without responsible management.,23
NA,NA,23
NA,Why the Changes Are Needed-PBS Costs and New Listings,24
NA,Australia's health system is demand driven. The pressure to provide access to more,24
NA,"services, more medicines and more expensive technologies is always increasing.",24
NA,There is a continual pipeline of complex and expensive new medicines delivering more,24
NA,"targeted and more personalised treatments. Since coming to government, the coalition has",24
NA,listed or expanded the listings of some 181 medicines on the PBS. Medicines are being listed,24
NA,twice as fast as under the former Labor government.,24
NA,"The additional cost of advances in treatment, together with the ongoing cost of medicines",24
NA,"for chronic conditions, means expenditure for our health system is growing faster than",24
NA,government and taxpayers can sustain.,24
NA,"If the PBS is to grow in a sustainable way, we need a whole-of-community approach and",24
NA,we all need to contribute-something successive governments have recognised since co-,24
NA,payments for the PBS were first introduced in 1960.,24
NA,"Earlier this year, this government approved new listings for medicines with an expected",24
NA,"cost to the PBS of $436 million. These listings include treatments for breast cancer,",24
NA,"melanoma and multiple sclerosis, some of which cost tens of thousands of dollars per patient.",24
NA,"At its March 2014 meeting, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC)",24
NA,"recommended a further $550 million in new listings. In July this year, the PBAC will consider",24
NA,applications for new PBS listings worth up to a further $3.6 billion. Funding for new listings,24
NA,is not factored into the forward estimates. It is new money that this government must find,24
NA,"every four months to provide access to those medicines, something we have committed to do.",24
NA,"But we cannot do that and contain spending without more help, a greater contribution from",24
NA,all Australians who benefit from the PBS.,24
NA,The changes proposed in the bill are expected to contribute savings to the government for,24
NA,the PBS and RPBS of around $1.3 billion over four years. They will provide a check on the,24
NA,"rate of growth in PBS expenditure. Importantly, they do not cut funding for the PBS.",24
NA,"We still expect that the PBS will grow, but more sustainably, from $9.2 billion in 2013-4 to",24
NA,$10.2 billion annually in 2017-18.,24
NA,Changes to Co-payments-General Patients,24
NA,"Under the changes commencing 1 January 2015, there will be a one-off increase in patient",24
NA,co-payment amounts for pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions. This increase will apply in,24
NA,addition to the usual annual consumer price index (CPI) adjustment which occurs on 1,24
NA,January each year.,24
NA,"The co-payment for general patients, which is currently $36.90, will increase by $5 in",24
NA,"addition to CPI. On average, general patients use two PBS subsidised prescriptions per year.",24
NA,"So, for an average user, the additional cost from 2015 would be $10 per year.",24
NA,Under Co-payment General Patient Prescriptions,24
NA,The increase in the general co-payment will not affect the cost to consumers for many,24
NA,commonly used medicines. Because the co-payment amount is the maximum that a person,24
NA,"needs to pay under the PBS, when the price of a prescription is less than the co-payment, the",24
NA,consumer pays the lesser amount.,24
NA,NA,24
NA,Medicines priced at less than the general co-payment already account for more than 40 per,25
NA,"cent of PBS listings, and over 70 per cent of general patient PBS prescriptions. By the time",25
NA,"the co-payment changes come into effect, more than 55 per cent of listings are expected to be",25
NA,below the general co-payment amount. These include listings for medicines used to treat high,25
NA,"blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, gastric ulceration, and skin conditions. As",25
NA,"competition in the market continues to bring prices down, those reductions are reflected in the",25
NA,"prices paid by consumers, as well as by the government.",25
NA,Changes to co-payments-concessional,25
NA,"For individuals and families who access pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional level,",25
NA,"including veterans and their dependants under the RPBS, the co-payment, which is currently",25
NA,"$6, will increase by 80c in addition to the CPI.",25
NA,"People with concessional benefits use, on average, 17 prescriptions each year. So under",25
NA,"these new arrangements, they will pay an extra $13.60 per year for their subsidised medicines.",25
NA,The government is asking concessional patients to contribute an extra 80c for prescriptions,25
NA,which cost on average $43.50. It will also be only an extra 80c for medicines such as the,25
NA,"cancer treatments, everolimus and dabrafenib that cost over $5,500 and $8,700 per",25
NA,prescription respectively.,25
NA,"Along with the co-payment changes, there will be parallel changes in PBS safety nets.",25
NA,Safety net arrangements help to protect people who require a lot of medicines from high,25
NA,"out-of-pocket costs. For all users of the PBS and RPBS, once the safety net threshold is",25
NA,"reached, the co-payment amount is reduced for prescriptions required for the rest of the",25
NA,"calendar year. For general patients, the co-payment reduces to the concessional amount, and",25
NA,"for concessional patients, the co-payment is reduced to zero.",25
NA,Changes to safety nets-general,25
NA,"Under the proposed changes, the general safety net, which is currently $1,421.20, will",25
NA,increase by 10 per cent of the safety net plus annual CPI indexation on 1 January each year,25
NA,"from 2015 until 2018. From 1 January 2019, only annual CPI indexation will apply.",25
NA,General patients who are high medicine users will pay around $145.30 more in 2015 before,25
NA,reaching the new safety net threshold-and thereafter will only pay the concessional co-,25
NA,payment to access subsidised medicines for the remainder of the calendar year.,25
NA,Changes to safety nets-concessional,25
NA,"The concessional safety net, which is currently equivalent to co-payments for 60",25
NA,"prescriptions, or $360, will increase by two prescriptions on 1 January each year from 2015 to",25
NA,2018. The resulting concessional safety net thresholds will be 62 prescriptions in 2015; 64 in,25
NA,2016; 66 in 2017; and 68 in 2018.,25
NA,Concessional patients who are high medicine users will pay around $61.80 more in 2015,25
NA,before reaching the new safety net threshold-and thereafter will receive all their PBS and,25
NA,RPBS subsidised medicines for free for the remainder of the calendar year.,25
NA,Operation of safety nets-and family example,25
NA,"Importantly, the same general or concessional safety net applies to individuals, couples and",25
NA,families. The safety net can be tallied separately for an individual or combined where the cost,25
NA,of medicines for couples or family members needs to be met from the same household budget.,25
NA,NA,25
NA,"For example, in 2015, a low-income family of two adults and two children, who hold a",26
NA,"concession card and obtain 72 prescriptions per year between them, will pay $61.80 more",26
NA,"than in 2014 before they reach the safety net threshold. But, once they reach the safety net,",26
NA,they will get the rest of their PBS prescriptions for that calendar year for free-that is 10,26
NA,"scripts for free-whether it be the $43.50 medicine, or the $5,500 medicine, or the $8,700",26
NA,"medicine, it will be provided to them at no cost.",26
NA,Changes to concessional contributions for closing the gap,26
NA,The changes in the bill will also apply for patient contributions charged at the concessional,26
NA,rate for the closing the gap PBS co-payment measure. Under the closing the gap,26
NA,"arrangements, eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander consumers, who would otherwise",26
NA,"pay the general co-payment for PBS prescriptions, pay at the concessional rate. Eligible",26
NA,concessional patients receive their PBS medicines for free.,26
NA,Patient contributions as one element of effective PBS management,26
NA,The government has inherited an enormous debt from the former Labor government and is,26
NA,"determined to ensure that health services are sustainable, are used efficiently, and are",26
NA,available for future generations.,26
NA,The PBS model requires that medicines undergo evidence based assessment of clinical and,26
NA,"cost effectiveness, be listed only on the recommendation of our expert advisory committee,",26
NA,and be subject to comparative and competitive pricing.,26
NA,Good management of the scheme also relies on the innovative products supplied by a,26
NA,"strong medicines industry, and the quality care provided by Australia's wide network of",26
NA,community pharmacies.,26
NA,"Since 1960, successive governments have continued to recognise that patient contributions",26
NA,are part of responsible management of the PBS. Indeed it was a Labor government that,26
NA,introduced a $2.50 patient contribution for pensioners in 1991 and a Labor government that,26
NA,increased the co-payment for general payments by 100 per cent from $5 to $10 in 1985.,26
NA,"It has been fair in the past, and it is fair now, to slightly increase the cost for consumers,",26
NA,given the increase in the cost of the PBS over the last 10 to 15 years and the number of very,26
NA,expensive drugs which will be listed in the future.,26
NA,Conclusion-Savings for new listings and the medical research future fund,26
NA,"Demand for the PBS will continue to grow, and we want to list medicines quickly. The",26
NA,expense of the latest treatments is a major cost driver for the PBS. Recent PBS listings,26
NA,"include medicines with a cost per patient per year of up to $110,000 for the treatment of",26
NA,"melanoma; around $38,000 for advanced breast cancer; $27,000 for prostate cancer; and up to",26
NA,"$17,000 for macular degeneration. As more high-cost medicines are listed, and more patients",26
NA,"require access to these treatments, the cost to taxpayers will increase.",26
NA,"By asking consumers to share in that cost, we can build a sustainable PBS that can continue",26
NA,to make otherwise prohibitively expensive treatments affordable for all Australians.,26
NA,"Importantly, this measure will also help to support future development of the types of",26
NA,innovative medicines people are seeking today. We will always be looking to prevent and,26
NA,treat illness and manage conditions that challenge us now.,26
NA,NA,26
NA,"And our medical researchers have led the way, from Howard Florey to Sir Gustav Nossal",27
NA,"and from Fiona Stanley to Ian Frazer. Australians have, through research and innovation,",27
NA,"saved millions of lives, not just here but around the world.",27
NA,Savings will contribute to the $20 billion capital protected Medical Research Future Fund.,27
NA,"When fully mature, it will add $1 billion to the resources available for medical research each",27
NA,and every year for generations to come. The fund will provide more opportunities for world-,27
NA,class Australian researchers to undertake basic and applied research and to test their results in,27
NA,clinical trials in this country. This investment is a huge step forward for Australia and will,27
NA,bring considerable health and economic benefits to our nation.,27
NA,The changes in this bill will strengthen the PBS while preserving all the features that make,27
NA,it such a valued part of Australia's health system.,27
NA,Debate adjourned.,27
NA,Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014,27
NA,First Reading,27
NA,Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Hunt.,27
NA,Bill read a first time.,27
NA,Second Reading,27
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (09:42): I move:,27
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,27
NA,The Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014 provides the framework for,27
NA,administering the Emissions Reduction Fund. At the recent election the public voted to repeal,27
NA,the carbon tax and to introduce the Emissions Reduction Fund as the heart of an incentive,27
NA,based approach to reducing Australia's emissions and to cleaning our air and land.,27
NA,"The Emissions Reduction Fund is, therefore, a fundamental election commitment and the",27
NA,key element of the government's policy to respond to climate change.,27
NA,"Through the Emissions Reduction Fund, the government will work in partnership with",27
NA,business and the community to achieve a cleaner environment through practical actions that,27
NA,"will achieve real, measurable results.",27
NA,"The government accepts fully the science of climate change. However, we reject the carbon",27
NA,tax because it is an ineffective mechanism and an unfair mechanism to deal with the challenge,27
NA,at hand.,27
NA,"The carbon tax was a $7.6 billion hit on the economy in its first year, yet emissions were",27
NA,"but 0.1 per cent lower. In short, it fails to do the job. The carbon tax has led to higher",27
NA,"electricity prices, higher gas prices and it has increased the cost of living. It is estimated by",27
NA,Treasury that repeal of the carbon tax will reduce average Australian household bills by $550,27
NA,"a year. It is, therefore, an unnecessary burden on Australian businesses, a drag on our",27
NA,international competitiveness and an unfair and ineffective hit on Australian families. For,27
NA,these reasons the government has moved to abolish the carbon tax as a fundamental priority,27
NA,since coming to office. The bills to abolish the carbon tax were the very first bills introduced,27
NA,into this House by the government by no less a person than the Prime Minister.,27
NA,NA,27
NA,The Emissions Reduction Fund will therefore be a better way to reduce emissions than,28
NA,imposing a carbon tax that increases energy costs for businesses and households.,28
NA,"In short, the carbon tax is an electricity tax, a gas tax and a refrigerant tax, and in the end",28
NA,the cost is always borne by Australian families.,28
NA,"The Emissions Reduction Fund, by contrast, is a major environmental program with",28
NA,"benefits for air quality, land management and agricultural productivity and a program to",28
NA,reduce emissions. It can be supported whatever one's views on climate issues.,28
NA,Funding for the ERF is already allocated in the budget. This bill sets out the administrative,28
NA,amendments to assist in implementation. Industry and farming groups strongly support,28
NA,implementing the Emissions Reduction Fund through the approach set out in the bill of,28
NA,building on-and streamlining-the existing Carbon Farming Initiative and using other,28
NA,existing government mechanisms and processes.,28
NA,"Unlike the approach under the carbon tax, the Emissions Reduction Fund will provide",28
NA,"positive incentives to help Australian businesses and households lower their energy costs,",28
NA,improve their agricultural productivity and increase their efficiency. It will do this by building,28
NA,on the Carbon Farming Initiative approach of supporting practical projects.,28
NA,This bill will implement the ERF to replace the carbon tax and provide a transition for the,28
NA,Carbon Farming Initiative. It will do this by amending the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming,28
NA,Initiative) Act 2011 and related acts.,28
NA,The Emissions Reduction Fund,28
NA,The objective of the Emissions Reduction Fund is to reduce emissions at lowest cost and,28
NA,help Australia meet its emissions reduction target of five per cent below 2000 levels by 2020.,28
NA,"To put that into context, on the most recent advice I have received from my department,",28
NA,"when you look over the period from 1990 to 2020, Australia and the United States achieve an",28
NA,almost identical net reduction over the course of a generation.,28
NA,The government is therefore making a significant investment in the fund. The 2014-15,28
NA,"budget sets out an initial commitment of $2.55 billion, with further funding to be considered",28
NA,"in future budgets. The Clean Energy Regulator, importantly, will be able to commit the full-",28
NA,"I repeat, the full-amount of funding in emissions reduction contracts from the",28
NA,commencement of the Emissions Reduction Fund. There will be no barrier to the full amount,28
NA,of contracts being written from day one. We have made a significant change: whereas these,28
NA,"had to be phased out over a four-year period, they can now commence in full without",28
NA,restriction from the moment of passage.,28
NA,Existing Carbon Farming Initiative participants will be well placed to bid in and access,28
NA,these funds to support their existing projects.,28
NA,Three simple principles have guided the design of the Emissions Reduction Fund. These,28
NA,principles are embedded in the framework that is established by this bill.,28
NA," First, the fund will encourage projects that deliver lowest cost emissions reductions.",28
NA," Second, emissions reductions will be genuine and go beyond 'business-as-usual'.",28
NA," Third, administration of the fund will be streamlined and cost-effective.",28
NA,NA,28
NA,"In short, the Emissions Reduction Fund will not create any significant new government",29
NA,"architecture. Instead, it will use existing structures and processes that are understood by",29
NA,industry whilst also streamlining them.,29
NA,"In particular, this bill does four key things to establish the Emissions Reduction Fund.",29
NA,Expanding the Carbon Farming Initiative,29
NA,"First, this bill expands the Carbon Farming Initiative to enable crediting of emissions",29
NA,reduction opportunities across all sectors of the economy.,29
NA,Expanding the scope of the Carbon Farming Initiative will allow businesses from all over,29
NA,Australia to bring projects forward and receive Australian carbon credit units for the,29
NA,emissions reductions they deliver through their projects.,29
NA,"Under the Carbon Farming Initiative, farmers and land managers are able to earn carbon",29
NA,credits by storing carbon or reducing greenhouse gas emissions on the land. These credits can,29
NA,then be sold to people and businesses wishing to offset their emissions. The Clean Energy,29
NA,Regulator has registered more than 130 Carbon Farming Initiative projects and issued over 6,29
NA,million Australian carbon credit units since the program commenced in late 2011.,29
NA,"Under the Emissions Reduction Fund, this Carbon Farming Initiative approach will be",29
NA,expanded so that other parts of the economy can access the system. This includes areas like,29
NA,"energy efficiency, waste coal mine gas, cleaning up power stations, the transport sector and",29
NA,large industrial facilities.,29
NA,The expansion of the Carbon Farming Initiative will be achieved by amending existing,29
NA,"legislation, which establishes the Carbon Farming Initiative, and amending the administrative",29
NA,"and reporting arrangements that support it, including the National Greenhouse and Energy",29
NA,Reporting Scheme.,29
NA,"In particular, the Carbon Farming Initiative Amendment Bill 2014 amends the Carbon",29
NA,"Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011, the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting",29
NA,"Act 2007, the Australian National Registry of Emissions Units Act 2011 and the Clean",29
NA,Energy Regulator Act 2011.,29
NA,Empowering the Clean Energy Regulator,29
NA,"Second, this bill empowers the Clean Energy Regulator to conduct auctions, enter contracts",29
NA,and purchase emissions reductions.,29
NA,It provides for the Clean Energy Regulator to run regular reverse auctions or other,29
NA,procurement processes. This will allow the government to simply and efficiently buy the,29
NA,"lowest cost emissions reductions across the economy from new projects, as well as existing",29
NA,Carbon Farming Initiative projects.,29
NA,"The projects with the lowest cost per tonne will be selected, and the Clean Energy",29
NA,Regulator will enter into contracts to purchase the emissions reductions from these projects.,29
NA,These contracts will give businesses confidence and certainty about the payments they will,29
NA,receive and provide genuine incentives and support to improve energy efficiency and,29
NA,agricultural productivity.,29
NA,The Clean Energy Regulator will publish information after auctions about auction,29
NA,outcomes to help businesses understand the opportunities available to them under the,29
NA,"Emissions Reduction Fund. This is full public transparency, as it should be.",29
NA,NA,29
NA,The competitive nature of this process will ensure that the Emissions Reduction Fund,30
NA,achieves the best value for taxpayers' money. Payments will be made after emissions,30
NA,"reductions are achieved, but under a contract for delivery. Therefore, the emissions reduction",30
NA,"providers have the bankable certainty of a contract with the Commonwealth, with periodic",30
NA,payments. The taxpayer and the Commonwealth have the security that they need only pay for,30
NA,actual abatement and actual emissions reductions as they occur and are verified.,30
NA,Streamlining processes,30
NA,"Third, the bill streamlines existing processes from the Carbon Farming Initiative, removing",30
NA,red tape to make it easier to register projects and receive credits.,30
NA,Fewer project registration steps will see projects approved more quickly.,30
NA,More flexible reporting arrangements will improve cash flow.,30
NA,A risk-based approach to audit means that lower-risk projects will have fewer obligations.,30
NA,The simplified eligibility requirements around property rights will make project,30
NA,aggregation easier.,30
NA,"Importantly, the bill will remove the exclusive 100-year permanence requirement, which",30
NA,has been a significant barrier to landholders increasing carbon stores in soils and vegetation.,30
NA,Landholders will now have the option of storing carbon for 25 years.,30
NA,Approving estimation methods will be quicker and easier than under the Carbon Farming,30
NA,Initiative.,30
NA,An independent expert body established under the current scheme will be broadened in,30
NA,scope and renamed the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee. It will advise the,30
NA,government to ensure methods are consistent with the scheme's focus on genuine emissions,30
NA,reductions. The complex and time-consuming process of assessing every activity against the,30
NA,common practice test under the Carbon Farming Initiative will be removed.,30
NA,Transitioning the Carbon Farming Initiative,30
NA,"Fourth, this bill provides transitional arrangements for existing participants in the Carbon",30
NA,Farming Initiative.,30
NA,Landholders and businesses with existing CFI projects will be able to transition smoothly,30
NA,into the Emissions Reduction Fund.,30
NA,"Existing Carbon Farming Initiative projects-such as projects to manage savannahs, plant",30
NA,trees or capture methane from piggeries-will be automatically registered under the,30
NA,"Emissions Reduction Fund and will be well placed to secure contracts at auction, subject to",30
NA,"lowest cost, that will deliver them a guaranteed revenue stream from their existing projects on",30
NA,"a bankable, periodic basis.",30
NA,"Existing Carbon Farming Initiative projects will also benefit from less red tape, and",30
NA,simplified reporting and audit processes under the new scheme.,30
NA,"Finally, the bill defines the roles and responsibilities of the Clean Energy Regulator. The",30
NA,"regulator has established a genuine reputation as an effective, fair and independent body since",30
NA,"its establishment, and has the required expertise to administer the Emissions Reduction Fund.",30
NA,NA,30
NA,Safeguard mechanism,31
NA,The fund also includes a safeguard mechanism to ensure that emissions reductions paid for,31
NA,by the government are not displaced by a significant rise in emissions elsewhere in the,31
NA,economy.,31
NA,The safeguard mechanism will commence on 1 July 2015 and its detailed design will be,31
NA,"subject to extensive consultation by industry and will, after that, be given effect by a final",31
NA,legislative package.,31
NA,Consultation and opportunities,31
NA,"In preparing this bill, the government has consulted widely with business, environment and",31
NA,"community representatives from across the Australian economy. I know, in my own case,",31
NA,over the course of the period since 2 February 2010 I have held over 250 meetings with,31
NA,"industry, community, environment groups and experts.",31
NA,"I would like to acknowledge the more than 300 organisations, businesses and individuals",31
NA,who have taken the time to contribute their expertise and ideas on the design of the Emissions,31
NA,Reduction Fund.,31
NA,"This feedback has made it clear that there are genuine, significant, low-cost emissions",31
NA,"reduction opportunities across Australia that can be unlocked through simple, positive",31
NA,incentives from the Emissions Reduction Fund.,31
NA,"The fund is, therefore, both an emissions reduction program and-I want to stress this-a",31
NA,major environmental program. It is also about substantial co-benefits to improve both,31
NA,economic and environmental outcomes.,31
NA,It can be supported as an environmental program whatever one's position on climate issues,31
NA,and the need to reduce emissions.,31
NA,"There are many types of projects that, for example, could be supported under the Emissions",31
NA,Reduction Fund. Possible examples include:,31
NA, Cleaning up Australia's waste sector by capturing the methane for flaring or generating,31
NA,"electricity, thereby improving local air quality.",31
NA," Emissions reductions from the transport sector-covering air, sea, road and rail activities-",31
NA,"from technology activities, low-emission vehicles and operational changes-",31
NA,"only last evening, I spoke with a former member of this place and close personal friend, Pat",31
NA,"Farmer, and he inquired about the potential for the fund to engage with low-emissions",31
NA,transport opportunities. I can specifically confirm to Mr Farmer and to others that are,31
NA,interested that it is expressly designed to offer opportunities for emissions reduction in the,31
NA,"transport sector. Again, this offers real opportunities to improve local air quality and reduce",31
NA,dangerous particulate pollution.,31
NA," The capture of coal mine gas, which could be flared or used to generate electricity.",31
NA, Using alternative waste treatment facilities to stop the waste being deposited in landfills in,31
NA,the first place. This is an approach widely supported in many places across Europe for,31
NA,generating clean electricity while avoiding noxious fumes. It has a significant local,31
NA,community benefit.,31
NA,NA,31
NA," Capturing methane from waste water facilities, whether it is at abattoirs or chemical",32
NA,"processing facilities, with, again, significant air quality benefits for neighboring",32
NA,landholders and residents.,32
NA, Improving industrial energy efficiency at large energy-using facilities through large-scale,32
NA,changes-such as installing more efficient process heating and the replacement of boilers,32
NA,and furnaces-or pulling together smaller incremental improvements that aggregate up to,32
NA,"large savings at power stations, cement and aluminium production facilities, and oil and",32
NA,gas extraction plants.,32
NA," Energy efficiency improvements in the commercial building sector, including offices, retail",32
NA,chains and educational facilities. This could include partial and full retrofits of existing,32
NA,"commercial buildings, installation of energy efficient lighting or fans, or the installation of",32
NA,coand tri-generation-,32
NA,"this is a particular opportunity for state and local governments, with the large administrative,",32
NA,educational and medical facilities which they own and operate-,32
NA, Improvements in the efficiency of household electricity consumption through aggregating up,32
NA,"individual changes across a large number of households, thereby reducing household energy costs",32
NA,and electricity bills.,32
NA, Projects to destroy the methane that is generated from manure in piggeries and dairies-,32
NA,"again, with local air quality improvements for neighbours-",32
NA," Projects to reduce emissions by feeding dietary additives to milking cows, with productivity benefits.",32
NA," Projects to manage fires in savanna grasslands, supporting Indigenous land management and",32
NA,communities.,32
NA," Revegetating land to improve water quality, and reduce erosion and salinity-",32
NA,"part of the long process of reversing land degradation in Australia, as we adapt our farming",32
NA,practices to the needs of this continent after two centuries of settlement; a fundamentally,32
NA,"important approach to improving land management, land health and the recovery of degraded",32
NA,areas-,32
NA, Replenishing the carbon content of soils to improve the health and productivity of Australian farms.,32
NA,This is a major opportunity with profound implications for productivity and soil health over,32
NA,"the coming decades and generations, and one which I believe will be fundamental, going",32
NA,forward.,32
NA,Conclusion,32
NA,"In conclusion, I wish to make a series of thank yous. I first want to thank, amongst my",32
NA,"colleagues, the Prime Minister for his support over a period of four years. He has been",32
NA,"unwavering in his view that we need to take action to reduce our emissions and, in particular,",32
NA,to have the co-benefits to clean up our environment. I also want to thank the minister at the,32
NA,"table, the Minister for Trade, Andrew Robb. He has been involved in this project from the",32
NA,outset and was fundamental in design issues prior to the release of the first policy. He has,32
NA,"provided tremendous personal support throughout the last four years; it is a very strong,",32
NA,"personal thank you. And I want to thank my parliamentary secretary, Senator Simon",32
NA,"Birmingham, who is in my view a future cabinet minister in waiting. His capabilities are",32
NA,extraordinary.,32
NA,NA,32
NA,"Within industry, I want to pay particular thanks to Danny Price and David Green who are",33
NA,the two co-chairs of the Expert Reference Group. They have brought together an outstanding,33
NA,"team under the Expert Reference Group, as well as having consulted widely. There are two",33
NA,"members of the Exigency economic management and modelling firm, Stuart Allinson and",33
NA,"Adrian Palmer, who have been fundamental guides throughout the past four years. I could not",33
NA,have done this without them.,33
NA,"Within the department, I want to acknowledge the secretary, Dr Gordon de Brouwer, who",33
NA,"has engaged deeply in this process, and officers, Tas Sakellaris, James White, Kristin Tilley,",33
NA,"Shayleen Thompson, Hilton Taylor and the rest of the Emissions Reduction Fund Taskforce",33
NA,within the department. I particularly want to acknowledge the absolutely indispensable advice,33
NA,"and the countless hours of work from the senior officers: Maya Stuart-Fox; Trevor Power,",33
NA,"who has been the head of the Emissions Reduction Fund Taskforce; and Dr Steven Kennedy,",33
NA,who is a deputy secretary within the department and who is really one of the shining lights of,33
NA,the Australian Public Service.,33
NA,"Within my office, I would like to thank my chief of staff, Wendy Black; senior adviser,",33
NA,"Patrick Gibbons; adviser, Alex Caroly; the DLO who has helped work with the department on",33
NA,"this, Nick Godden; and to make a special thanks to the adviser responsible for the Emissions",33
NA,"Reduction Fund, Temay Rigzin, whose understanding of Treasury, of the Emissions",33
NA,"Reduction Fund and of industry, and literally hundreds of hours of work, has been",33
NA,fundamental to reaching this point.,33
NA,"Ultimately, the government knows that the protection of the environment and pursuit of",33
NA,economic growth are not mutually exclusive objectives.,33
NA,They are two essential elements of a stronger Australia.,33
NA,That is why we do not agree with the proposition that the only way to protect the,33
NA,environment is by destroying Australia's competitiveness.,33
NA,And that is why we have moved to abolish the carbon tax as our first legislative act as an,33
NA,incoming government. It does not work. It is not fair. The Australian people rejected it.,33
NA,"There is a menu, therefore, of approaches available to reduce emissions in different",33
NA,economies and societies.,33
NA,"For Australia, an approach that directly purchases emissions reductions through an",33
NA,Emissions Reduction Fund is a better way than an approach that raises prices for all,33
NA,Australians.,33
NA,"By building on the successes of the Carbon Farming Initiative, this bill supports positive",33
NA,"action by farmers, businesses and households.",33
NA,"This bill will use positive incentives to reduce emissions, unlock economic activity, boost",33
NA,energy efficiency and improve agricultural productivity.,33
NA,The bill makes economic sense for Australia. It makes environmental sense for Australia. It,33

NA,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (10:07): On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint,34
NA,"Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's seventh report of the 44th Parliament",34
NA,entitled Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary,34
NA,"Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 13 to 29 May 2014, Legislative Instruments received 8",34
NA,"March to 30 May 2014-Report, June 2014.",34
NA,Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).,34
NA,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON: by leave-The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human,34
NA,Rights' seventh report of the 44th Parliament covers 42 bills introduced in the period 13 to 29,34
NA,"May, seven of which have been deferred for further consideration, and 218 legislative",34
NA,instruments received during the period 8 March to 30 May. The report also includes the,34
NA,committee's consideration of 15 responses to matters raised in previous committee reports,34
NA,with ministers.,34
NA,"Of the bills considered in this report, I note the following bills are scheduled for debate in",34
NA,the parliament this week:,34
NA, Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2014; and,34
NA, Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014.,34
NA,The report outlines the committee's assessment of the compatibility of these bills with,34
NA,"human rights, and I encourage my fellow members to look to the committee's report to inform",34
NA,their deliberations on the merits of this proposed legislation.,34
NA,I would like to draw members' attention to one bill in this report which is of particular,34
NA,interest and relevance to the committee's task of assessing legislation for compatibility with,34
NA,human rights.,34
NA,The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2014 consists of six schedules of,34
NA,amendments to the Migration Act and the Australian Citizenship Act. Key changes include:,34
NA, amending the existing limitations on applying for a further protection visa to include,34
NA,situations where the first visa application was made on behalf of a non-citizen. This would,34
NA,"cover situations where the non-citizen did not know of, or did not understand, the nature of",34
NA,the application due to a mental impairment or because they were a minor;,34
NA, extending debt recovery provisions for detention costs to all convicted people smugglers,34
NA,and illegal foreign fishers;,34
NA," amending the role of authorised recipients for visa applicants, and the Migration Review",34
NA,Tribunal and Refugee Review Tribunal's obligation to give documents to authorised,34
NA,recipients;,34
NA,NA,34
NA," providing access to, and use of, material and information obtained under a search warrant",35
NA,in migration and citizenship decisions; and,35
NA, amending the procedural fairness provisions that apply to visa applicants.,35
NA,"As noted in the report, the committee has raised concerns about each of these amendments.",35
NA,"In most cases, the committee has sought more information from the minister, noting that the",35
NA,statement of compatibility for the bill did not provide an adequate assessment of how the,35
NA,"limitation on rights in each case was reasonable, necessary and proportionate.",35
NA,"In particular, the committee noted that extending the statutory bar on repeat protection visa",35
NA,applications to children and persons with a mental impairment engages a number of human,35
NA,rights. These include the best interests of the child and the right of persons with a mental,35
NA,impairment to legal capacity. The schedule also engages Australia's nonrefoulement,35
NA,"obligations-the obligation not to return people to harm. In this regard, the committee notes",35
NA,that merits review of decisions to remove people from Australia is an important aspect of our,35
NA,nonrefoulement obligations. I encourage members to consult the full discussion of the bill in,35
NA,"the report, which provides a more detailed account of the issues raised. Finally, in relation to",35
NA,"responses to matters previously raised by the committee, the report contains consideration of",35
NA,"15 such responses, and the committee's concluding remarks on these matters.",35
NA,"With these comments, I commend the committee's seventh report of the 44th Parliament to",35
NA,the chamber.,35

Ms BUTLER ,Griffith) (10:11): Our population is changing. There are more older people,35
NA,"than before. Baby boomers have started to retire, and people are living longer. It is all good",35
NA,"news. One consequence of those changes is that Australia needs workers. Among others, we",35
NA,"need people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s to have every opportunity to participate in our",35
NA,"workforce. We need them to use their skills, to develop their skills, to be productive, to pay",35
NA,NA,35
NA,"taxes and to stay in the workforce so that their pay increases, so that their tax payments",36
NA,"increase, so that they do not lose their skills, so that they learn, so that they stay connected, so",36
NA,that they can contribute.,36
NA,"One thing our country needs, so that people of parenting age can stay in the workforce, is",36
NA,"child care. Child care allows parents to return to work. More than 978,000 families across",36
NA,Australia rely on child care on a daily basis. There are lots of good reasons why a parent,36
NA,"might want to return to work-there is the obvious financial benefit of earning a wage, but",36
NA,"there are other benefits too. One is that the longer you are away from the workforce, the more",36
NA,likely it is that your skills will become eroded or outdated. That can make it harder to get back,36
NA,"into the workforce, and even once you are there it can mean delayed promotion, delayed",36
NA,opportunities for development and lower wages over a lifetime. You can miss opportunities,36
NA,"for promotion that you would have had, had you had a shorter absence from the workforce.",36
NA,"Another reason that people might want to return to work is wellbeing. For a lot of us, our",36
NA,"identity is wrapped up in our work. If you have built a successful career, or developed skills,",36
NA,"or you have been part of an organisation successfully for a long period of time, your identity",36
NA,"can be largely wrapped up in what you do. It can be an opportunity for inclusion, an",36
NA,"opportunity for social contact, an opportunity just to have a conversation that is not about",36
NA,nappies or pressing domestic concerns. It can affect your sense of self-worth. For those,36
NA,reasons it is important not just from a national perspective but also from an individual,36
NA,perspective that we remove barriers and impediments to returning to work for people who are,36
NA,parents.,36
NA,None of this is intended to denigrate or belittle the work of those who choose to remain out,36
NA,of the paid workforce to undertake important parenting responsibilities. Having been both a,36
NA,"stay-at-home parent and a principal in a national law firm, I value both roles, and I know that",36
NA,in a lot of ways that stay-at-home parenting work can be tougher and more demanding than,36
NA,returning to a career in the paid workforce. For those who want to return to the paid,36
NA,"workforce, our nation should do what it reasonably can to remove any barriers. One aspect of",36
NA,"removing barriers is good regulation that allows people to have a job that they can return to,",36
NA,"that prevents them from being sacked for taking parental leave, that helps working",36
NA,arrangements to fit around life as a parent and that helps to fight discrimination against,36
NA,parents.,36
NA,Another aspect is not legislative; it is building a culture where absence from the workforce,36
NA,"to have a child is seen as the norm for people of parenting age-in other words, a work",36
NA,"culture where work and family fit together and are not in competition with each other, and",36
NA,"where people are seen as individuals and parents, not just as workers. Obviously a further",36
NA,aspect is paid parental leave. It takes away some of the pressure of absence and helps reduce,36
NA,"disadvantage, and it allows the person taking parental leave to keep in touch with the",36
NA,workplace throughout their absence.,36
NA,"Of course, child care is a very important part of the puzzle. Without child care, returning to",36
NA,"work can be just impossible. Australian parents and their kids need quality, accessible and",36
NA,affordable child care. Research shows the relationship between workforce participation for,36
NA,women particularly and the cost of child care. When the gross costs of child care go up by one,36
NA,"per cent, women's workforce participation decreases by 0.7 per cent. These are obviously",36
NA,concerning statistics given the imperatives that we have to make sure that our paid workforce,36
NA,NA,36
NA,base is as big as possible as our population changes and we face the challenges inherent in,37
NA,those changes. Child care is not just important for today's workforce; it is important for our,37
NA,nation's future. It is important to our ability to raise enough revenue to pay for the services,37
NA,that our people need. It is also important for our children's future. Early learning is so,37
NA,"significant when it comes to making sure that our children will have the best prospects, the",37
NA,best opportunities and the best future possible.,37
NA,The reason I made those opening remarks was to explain why I find this bill so,37
NA,disappointing and why I so strongly support the Labor amendment. It is because this bill is,37
NA,aimed at making child care less affordable for parents. The bill will decrease the real value to,37
NA,working families of the childcare rebate and the childcare benefit. It will do so by freezing,37
NA,indexation not just for the non means-tested child care rebate but also for the income,37
NA,thresholds of the means tested child care benefit. It is a cut of $336 million from childcare,37
NA,support that lowand middle-income families in Australia rely on.,37
NA,It is so ill-timed. It comes only weeks before the Productivity Commission inquiry that the,37
NA,government itself instigated is due to provide an interim report. The government should await,37
NA,the Productivity Commission's recommendations and views on child care before altering,37
NA,childcare policy. This is an alteration in policy in that it is aimed at making child care less,37
NA,"affordable. Like many other Australians, I made a submission to the Productivity Commission",37
NA,"inquiry into child care in good faith, expecting that the government of the day would await its",37
NA,recommendations before making changes to child care. By reducing access to child care and,37
NA,reducing affordability the government is jumping the gun. It should be waiting for the,37
NA,Productivity Commission.,37
NA,But more important than process issues are substantive issues. The measures in this bill are,37
NA,unprecedented. No government has frozen indexation on the childcare rebate without using,37
NA,the proceeds of the savings to help fund child care quality measures by returning the savings,37
NA,to early learning. No government at all has frozen the income thresholds on the childcare,37
NA,"benefit. These unprecedented measures are greatly disappointing, but sadly this approach is",37
NA,"consistent with the Liberal-Nationals' longstanding failure to support accessible, affordable",37
NA,child care.,37
NA,I remember very well in the late 1990s that one of the first measures of the newly elected,37
NA,Howard government was to abolish operating subsidies for community childcare centres. In,37
NA,"the same year, they reduced the childcare cash rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for one-",37
NA,"child families with incomes above $70,000 a year. The Howard government just did not get",37
NA,"child care. Unfortunately, it is a pattern that is continuing.",37
NA,"In contrast, Labor has an outstanding record on child care. Just last year then Minister Ellis",37
NA,recounted some of our achievements on child care in a speech to the Australian Childcare,37
NA,Alliance. She described some of Labor's achievements and said:,37
NA,"In affordability alone we have seen a massive increase in investment, we have seen an increase in the",37
NA,"child care rebate from 30 to 50 percent, we have seen the increase in the cap of the child care rebate",37
NA,"from $4,354 a year up to $7,500 per year but importantly they aren't the only statistics that matter.",37
NA,The statistics that matter is the impact that this increase is having in Australian families. What we do,37
NA,know is that in 2004 when a family was spending on average 13 percent of their disposable income on,37
NA,"their childcare fees, that by 2011 that figure stood at 7.5 percent.",37
NA,NA,37
NA,So we have seen a reduction in the proportion of disposable income spent on child care. I,38
NA,"know that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who was the member for Griffith before my",38
NA,"election as the member for Griffith, was very proud of the move to increase the childcare",38
NA,assistance from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. He spoke to me about that change and about the,38
NA,importance of making child care available to working families.,38
NA,When you look at the history of the coalition's actions and Labor's actions on child care,38
NA,you see the difference. Labor has always believed in and supported workforce participation,38
NA,"measures and early learning measures, whereas unfortunately the coalition has not. It is a",38
NA,similar proposition when it comes to paid parental leave. I remember very well when Jenny,38
NA,Macklin was the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party federally and the great pride,38
NA,that I felt as a young member of the Australian Labor Party that she was championing a paid,38
NA,"parental leave scheme nationally. At the time, though, unfortunately the Howard government",38
NA,"was opposing paid parental leave. Instead, we saw the absolutely flawed policy of the baby",38
NA,bonus-a policy that was widely criticised as an example of poor public policy.,38
NA,"We championed paid parental leave and, once Labor was elected to government, we",38
NA,"commissioned a Productivity Commission inquiry and, quite rightly, waited for the outcome",38
NA,"of that inquiry. At that point we implemented a paid parental leave scheme consistent,",38
NA,"importantly, with the Productivity Commission inquiry recommendations. That was a",38
NA,"minimum wage, fixed-amount paid parental leave scheme where everybody would get the",38
NA,"same amount. It was a fair scheme, unlike the Abbott government's wholly unfair Paid",38
NA,Parental Leave Scheme where the more well off you are the more money you get from the,38
NA,government. It is frankly ridiculous and repressive.,38
NA,I know that in this debate there has been a bit of discussion about the priorities in this,38
NA,government's spending when it comes to work and family policies. All I want to say about,38
NA,that is that it is very disappointing that we are seeing a lot of myths being perpetuated in the,38
NA,"debate. For example, last night we heard a member indicating that it was fair for paid parental",38
NA,"leave paid by the taxpayer to be paid at full income replacement, notwithstanding the",38
NA,"Productivity Commission's recommendation directly to the contrary, because annual leave",38
NA,and sick leave get paid at income replacement rates. That wholly misunderstands the nature of,38
NA,the paid parental leave payment that is going to be paid for by the taxpayer. It is flawed,38
NA,analogy because we all know that annual leave and sick leave are not paid for by the taxpayer;,38
NA,they are paid for by the employer.,38
NA,This partly demonstrates some of the problems with this paid parental leave scheme. The,38
NA,Abbott government wants the taxpayers to pay income replacement for well-off people and,38
NA,employers to stop paying those income replacements. In those situations where there has been,38
NA,enterprise bargaining and where productivity gains have been exchanged for improved,38
NA,conditions for working people and where employers are now paying income replacement paid,38
NA,"parental leave, the government would like to relieve those employers of that obligation and to",38
NA,effectively subsidise those employers by transferring the obligation to make those payments,38
NA,"from the employer to the taxpayer. Frankly, I think that is ridiculous and unfair.",38
NA,"For that matter, all of the allegations made that everybody should have the same paid",38
NA,"parental leave entitlements are really interesting, as they come from a government, a party and",38
NA,"a tradition that champions individual bargaining, and I am sure they would not be suggesting",38
NA,that pay and condition improvements ought to come without corresponding increases in,38
NA,NA,38
NA,"productivity and productivity gains. But I digress, Deputy Speaker Mitchell. We are talking",39
NA,about child care.,39
NA,The Abbott government's record on child care and work and family policy is just atrocious.,39
NA,"They promised no cuts to education before the election, and what have we seen since the",39
NA,"election-cutting funding for schools, cutting funding for universities, higher university fees",39
NA,"for students, failure to guarantee future funding for preschool. And now early childhood",39
NA,education has been added to the long list of Abbott government broken promises. It is pure,39
NA,hypocrisy not least because the Prime Minister personally wrote to centres about the impact of,39
NA,"capping the childcare rebate on families before the election, saying it would mean increasing",39
NA,out-of-pocket costs for families. Of course that is exactly what this bill is for; that is exactly,39
NA,what this bill does. We have already seen this government's announcements stripping almost a,39
NA,"billion dollars from early education and care, $450 million cut from outside of school hours",39
NA,"care, $157 million cut from family day care services and a range of other cuts. But we are",39
NA,"now seeing this square, direct attack on the childcare rebate and the childcare benefit.",39
NA,The childcare benefit is means-tested and targeted. It is extraordinary that the government,39
NA,is going to make cuts to a payment for which eligibility starts to reduce when families earn,39
NA,"just $41,000. We know from the Senate committee hearings that the government has done",39
NA,"very little, if any, real analysis of who will be hurt by these changes and how much they will",39
NA,"pay. Instead, this is a government that is trying to rush these childcare benefit changes",39
NA,through the parliament in a sneaky and underhanded way and these changes are going to have,39
NA,"a negative impact on at least 500,000 lowand middle-income families. It is just not good",39
NA,enough.,39
NA,"It is a very disappointing set of changes, and that is why Labor believes that particularly for",39
NA,"the childcare benefit there ought to be an opportunity to fully consider, consult and debate in",39
NA,respect of those changes. That is why we have moved the amendment to split the bill. We,39
NA,believe that particularly for that relief targeted to lower and middle-income earners there,39
NA,ought to be an opportunity for further discussion and further consideration in respect of that,39
NA,"change to the childcare benefit. Frankly, it is a ridiculous indictment of this government's",39
NA,policies that they are refusing to reconsider their ridiculous paid parental leave scheme where,39
NA,"the more you earn the more you get, while at the same time making it harder for families to",39
NA,afford child care.,39
Ms OWENS ,Parramatta) (10:26): I rise to speak on the Family Assistance Legislation,39
NA,Amendment (Child Care Measures) Bill 2014. This bill seeks to do two things: to freeze the,39
NA,childcare rebate limit at $7½ thousand per child per annum for three years and to freeze,39
NA,income thresholds for the childcare benefit CCB for three years. In the second reading,39
NA,"amendment proposed by the shadow minister, Kate Ellis, we have made it very clear that on",39
NA,this side of the House the opposition calls for the two elements of this bill to be separated so,39
NA,that they can be considered separately and there can be real community consultation with,39
NA,families and childcare providers on the effects of these changes separately.,39
NA,"For Labor there is quite a difference between the two. The childcare rebate, firstly, was",39
NA,something that Labor also sought to freeze when we were in opposition. The then opposition,39
NA,of course fought against that and argued that it was poor decision and they went around the,39
NA,country saying that it was a poor decision. But at the time we were talking about freezing the,39
NA,childcare rebate in order to transfer that money into other areas of child care. The then,39
NA,NA,39
NA,opposition has now completely changed its mind and thinks that it is a very good idea not just,40
NA,"to freeze the rebate but to take that money out of child care completely, in other words, reduce",40
NA,the amount of funding available to parents who seek to put their children into child care.,40
NA,"The second element, though, the childcare benefit is something that we on this side of the",40
NA,House have extraordinary concerns about. This benefit is very much about lowand middle-,40
NA,"income families. In many ways the combination of the two, the rebate and the benefit,",40
NA,recognises that for lower income families the proportion of the disposable income they spend,40
NA,on child care is greater and this compensates lower income and middle-income families for,40
NA,that difference by providing an extra payment. I heard the minister this morning on radio,40
NA,pretending that the freezing of the benefit would not make a difference because parents would,40
NA,"then pick it up in the childcare rebate. If you know anything about mathematics, of course you",40
NA,would realise that that is not true. The childcare benefit is a 100 per cent payment and the,40
NA,"rebate is 50 per cent up to $7½ thousand, so the more you reduce the benefit the less a low-",40
NA,"income family receives in assistance, and it can be a substantial amount over a 12-month",40
NA,period.,40
NA,"In many ways, this is the government of extraordinary contradictions. We have an amazing",40
NA,"one here where we see on one hand the gold plated paid parental leave scheme, which",40
NA,"reimburses a parent at their full rate of pay up to $50,000, presumably intending to assist",40
NA,"women to move in and out of the workforce. On the other hand, on the same page, they then",40
NA,"make it more difficult for families to afford the child care they need on returning to work. So,",40
NA,on one hand they argue that they are trying to help women return to work and on the other,40
NA,hand they take the very thing that assists a family in raising children for the years after the,40
NA,"birth of a child-again, an extraordinary contradiction.",40
NA,But we see it in so many other ways: the slowing down of the increase in the super,40
NA,"contribution, which makes it more likely that a person will need the pension-and then they",40
NA,"cut the pension. They cut all funding to urban rail projects, making it more necessary to drive,",40
NA,"and then they raise the cost of petrol. They cut preventive health agencies, making it more",40
NA,"likely that a person will need to see a doctor, and then they raise the cost of going to a doctor.",40
NA,"They deregulate universities, presumably to allow more people in to universities, but make it",40
NA,less affordable in doing so. They increase the interest on HECS to six per cent so that the,40
NA,more you earn the less you pay. A person working in a lower-paid job with the same,40
NA,university degree will pay more for their university education than a person in a higher paid,40
NA,"job. And of course there is this one, where they are providing extraordinary levels of",40
NA,assistance to high-income earners yet making it more difficult for women in the lowerand,40
NA,middle-income areas to actually return to work at all.,40
NA,You can see from our record in government the extent to which Labor understands the,40
NA,"economic benefits of child care and preschool. We invested considerably in those areas,",40
NA,"because we understand, unlike the current government, that prosperity is built not by the",40
NA,assets that we have in the ground but by the assets we have in our minds. We heard the,40
NA,"Treasurer mention the word '2050' recently in terms of the costs of pensions, but we never",40
NA,hear the government talk about 2050 in terms of prosperity and where this nation will be at,40
NA,that time. But those of us who do think about that know that in 2050 it will not be the coal in,40
NA,the ground that makes us prosperous; it will be what we have in our minds-our ability to,40
NA,NA,40
NA,"think, our ability to outperform intellectually and outperform in innovation the extraordinary",41
NA,powerhouses to our north.,41
NA,The assets in 2050 will not be 55-year-olds like me; they will be 35-year-olds. Given the,41
NA,"speed of change, the assets in 2050 will be the minds of our 35-year-olds-who are being",41
NA,"born this year, and it takes 35 years to make one. It takes 35 years to make a good 35-year-",41
NA,"old. And, unlike many other assets, you cannot retrofit them. You cannot redo their first five",41
NA,"years of life. When a baby's mind decides that it wants to learn about language, that is what it",41
NA,"learns, and you either encourage it to do that or you do not. You cannot do it later at anywhere",41
NA,"near the same speed and, if you try, it costs you more. It takes 35 years to build the good 35-",41
NA,"year-old worker that we will need in 2050, and it starts this year with the birth of children. We",41
NA,"knew that, and that is why when we were in government we invested incredibly in preschool",41
NA,and early childhood education and sought to raise the standards so that child care was not,41
NA,about child minding but was actually about building the lives and the assets of the future.,41
NA,There has been a considerable amount of research done on this. It is incredibly,41
NA,impressive-not just the impact of child care on threeto five-year-olds or twoto five-year-,41
NA,olds but the impact of child care on zeroto two-year-olds. Goodstart.org.au has provided,41
NA,some incredibly well-researched data. It assessed all year in year 1 against seven development,41
NA,"domains, and it found that children who did not attend preschool were 50 per cent more likely",41
NA,to be developmentally vulnerable than children who did and that children from the poorest 20,41
NA,per cent of households were twice as likely to be developmentally vulnerable as those from,41
NA,"the richest 20 per cent. In other words, as a government, you need to invest in the poorest 20",41
NA,per cent of households to lift them. If you want to be a 'lifter'-to use the language of the,41
NA,"government-you invest in the poorest 20 per cent of households, because they are the ones",41
NA,"where the difference will be greater, where there is a 50 per cent greater chance of them being",41
NA,developmentally vulnerable than there is for a child who did not attend preschool. Children,41
NA,who were developmentally vulnerable were also three times as likely as other children to,41
NA,"perform poorly in reading, numeracy and NAPLAN tests in year 3, year 5 and year 7, again",41
NA,demonstrating that you cannot retrofit those first years of a child's life.,41
NA,Children who attended three years of early learning or more performed much better on,41
NA,"four-year literacy and numeracy tests. These tests, in 2011, were done over 40 developed",41
NA,countries that participated in international tests in literacy and numeracy and science for grade,41
NA,4 children. Children who had three years of early learning or more scored an average of 30 to,41
NA,40 points higher in the tests than did children who had no early learning and around 20 points,41
NA,"higher than those who attended only one year of early learning. So, again, these early years",41
NA,are incredibly important in setting up those foundations across those incredibly important,41
NA,"disciplines of reading, maths and science. Children who were taught by a preschool teacher",41
NA,"with a diploma or degree qualifications scored 20 or 30 points higher in year 3. So, again, that",41
NA,quality framework that Labor introduced was done for a reason. It was done to ensure that our,41
NA,children in those incredibly important years of age zero to five had absolutely the best start in,41
NA,life so that when they reach 35 years of age and they are competing against these,41
NA,powerhouses to the north they will be the employees that our businesses want and they will be,41
NA,able to build good lives for themselves.,41
NA,"These are incredible results. A 15-year study of 3,000 English schoolchildren found that",41
NA,access to high-quality preschool had a strong effect on later literacy and numeracy and that,41
NA,NA,41
NA,the effect of 18 months of preschool was stronger on literacy and numeracy at age 11 than,42
NA,"were all the six years of primary school. In other words, you can make a greater difference",42
NA,"with that 18 months of preschool than you can in six years of school-again, absolute",42
NA,evidence for why governments should be investing in these early years to an incredible extent,42
NA,and why a bill before this House that makes it more difficult for people from low-income,42
NA,families to keep their children in child care to an extent that benefits the child is incredibly,42
NA,poor decision making. It indicates an extraordinary lack of vision for the future and indicates,42
NA,a government that claims to be thinking about the future but actually is not in any way.,42
NA,"That is why Labor, when it was in government, did a number of really important things,",42
NA,and it is really sad to see this government undoing those things as quickly as it can. Following,42
NA,its election in 2007 it increased the Child Care Rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-,42
NA,"of-pocket expenses and increased the cap from $4,300 to $7,500 per child, an incredibly",42
NA,important measure that meant that the number of children in child care at any one time grew,42
NA,"to over one million, an increase of nearly 30 per cent since 2007.",42
NA,"We also introduced federal funding for preschool, and as a result the number of children",42
NA,benefiting from 15 hours of preschool-that is the number of hours covered in the survey,42
NA,"from the UK-increased from 12 per cent of children, in 2008, to over 56 per cent of children",42
NA,in 2008. We know that attending 15 hours of preschool leads to higher scores in year 3,42
NA,"NAPLAN tests and year 4 maths, science and languages. In other words, that 15 hours of",42
NA,preschool is essential to building the assets this country needs.,42
NA,"We are benefiting from historical advances in education that we inherited, largely due to",42
NA,our history. With the extraordinary efforts that our neighbours to the north are putting into,42
NA,"education on 50-year plans, if we think we can continue the way we are and still be",42
NA,"competitive in 2050, we are kidding ourselves.",42
NA,Let's look at what the government have done. They campaigned on making child care more,42
NA,"affordable, yet they have done exactly the reverse. They stripped almost $1 billion from early",42
NA,"education and care, $450 million for outside-school-hours care is gone, $157 million for",42
NA,"family day-care centres is gone, support to help parents complete study and get back to work",42
NA,"has been cut, programs to increase childcare places are completely gone, and Aboriginal",42
NA,Child and Family Centres funding is gone. How extraordinary is that from a government that,42
NA,speaks the language but cuts the programs. Then there is $300 million in support for educator,42
NA,"wages, which is completely gone. Now, they are out on the attack on the backbone of the",42
NA,"childcare system, which is the Child Care Rebate and the Child Care Benefit. I stress again",42
NA,that the Child Care Benefit is the one that assists lowand middle-income families to keep,42
NA,their children in child care to the extent necessary for that child to benefit from that outcome.,42
NA,"They have also cut funding to the Partnership Agreement on Early Childhood, which funded",42
NA,"preschool attendance of up to 15 hours per week, which again is something that will have an",42
NA,extraordinary impact on the future of our children.,42
NA,I heard the minister this morning on radio saying that you can move from the benefit to the,42
NA,rebate. A basic understanding of maths would indicate that that is not the case. I would hope,42
NA,that in future our children who attend preschool for more than 15 hours a week would be able,42
NA,"to see that, because it is actually quite basic mathematics. She also said that the government",42
NA,had no choice. That is an extraordinary thing. I did a quick calculation this morning on paid,42
NA,"parental leave and the Child Care Rebate, given that the Child Care Benefit, even in its most",42
NA,NA,42
NA,"expensive year of the forward estimates, would save the government $76.9 million this year.",43
NA,But I would say that it will cost Australians far more than that in the future through,43
NA,opportunity cost. But $76.9 million is about 1.5 per cent of what they would spend in a year,43
NA,"on the paid parental leave scheme. So instead of paying 100 per cent of wages for women, up",43
NA,"to $50,000, they could pay 98.5 per cent of wages and that would actually cover the",43
NA,difference. So they do have choices. They are making choices to put money into one area and,43
NA,"not another, and this is a very bad place to start cutting.",43
Mr CONROY ,Charlton) (10:41): I rise very reluctantly to talk about the Family,43
NA,Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Measures) Bill 2014. I am reluctant because,43
NA,we should not be having this debate. Both sides of the House rhetorically agree about the,43
NA,huge importance of investing in early childhood. The member for Parramatta put it very,43
NA,eloquently when she spoke about the fact that the greatest investment this nation can have is,43
NA,"in its children, especially in early childhood investment and especially for children from low",43
NA,socioeconomic backgrounds.,43
NA,We should not be having this debate on a bill that cuts assistance for child care-that,43
NA,"represents a $336 million cut to childcare assistance in this country, with over $200 million of",43
NA,that cut hitting some of the poorest people in our community. Freezing the Child Care Benefit,43
NA,"will leave over 500,000 families worse off, and these are low-income families, not rich",43
NA,"families. I heard Liberal speakers last night, particularly the member for Bowman",43
NA,acknowledging that on their own figures this will represent a hit of around $200 a year for,43
NA,"each child. In fact, I would argue that is being wildly optimistic. Early Childhood Australia",43
NA,"has done modelling estimating that a family on $60,000 a year, well under the average wage,",43
NA,"with one child in the childcare system will be $1,800 a year worse off by 2016-17. From a",43
NA,"total family income of $60,000 they will be $1,800 worse off. This is a massive hit. As the",43
NA,"member for Parramatta said, this is a massive hit on families that we need to be supporting by",43
NA,"investing in child care. Early-childhood investment is so important, and this bill moves us",43
NA,away from that investment.,43
NA,"Unfortunately, this bill is part of a wider attack on child care by this government. This",43
NA,government has already stripped over $1 billion out of child care funding. This includes $450,43
NA,"million for outside-school-hours care, $78 million per annum cut from the Aboriginal Child",43
NA,"and Family Centres, and $157 million cut from the community support program. Now we",43
NA,"hear that preschool funding, through the National Partnerships Agreement, is well and truly",43
NA,under threat. All of these will have an impact on families trying to invest in child care for,43
NA,"their kids. For example, the $157 million cut from the community support program represents",43
NA,"a $35 per week hit on families. That is nearly $2,000 per annum. If you add the $2,000 hit",43
NA,"from that funding cut to the $1,800 hit from this you have almost $4,000 in cuts to childcare",43
NA,assistance for families. That particular cut really represents an attack on family day care.,43
NA,Those on the other side champion the fact that they are pro family day care. They are the,43
NA,"ones who constantly support that very important part of the sector, but when you match their",43
NA,"actions with the rhetoric, we find them well and truly wanting.",43
NA,A person in my wife's mothers group recently set up a family day care centre. It was a huge,43
NA,challenge for her to go around babyproofing a house and to go through all the training and,43
NA,quality assessment. One of the reasons she was able to take on this huge endeavour was that,43
NA,she got administrative assistance so that she did not have to spend three-quarters of her week,43
NA,NA,43
NA,doing paperwork. This $157 million cut represents a direct attack on her and everyone like her,44
NA,who is trying to run a family day care centre and provide greater flexibility for families.,44
NA,All of this represents yet another broken promise from those on the other side. Mr Abbott,44
NA,went to the election promising to make child care more affordable. He promised to do away,44
NA,with these indexation freezes-he attacked them ferociously before the election. What do we,44
NA,"see now? We see a billion dollars in cuts, more indexation freezes and more direct attacks on",44
NA,families.,44
NA,"The Hunter Valley, my region, is among the regions that are least able to afford these cuts.",44
NA,"It is a region with quite diverse income levels, but it includes some of the poorest suburbs in",44
NA,"the nation-and there is a real lack of child care. On average, there is a two-year wait for",44
NA,child care in the Hunter.,44
NA,I can talk about the childcare situation in the Hunter from a personal perspective. My wife,44
NA,"and I are, I acknowledge, in a very privileged position. But when my wife fell pregnant with",44
NA,"our child, we did the right thing. Once we hit the 12-week mark and we had the scan that said",44
NA,"that everything was generally okay, we put our name down-'unknown Conroy' was what we",44
NA,put down-at myriad childcare centres. We put our own name down with 15 childcare centres,44
NA,"in the region. A year later, not one of them delivered a place. I remember, on 20 December,",44
NA,"the last working day of the year, ringing 20 other childcare centres in the vain hope someone",44
NA,"had a spot in an infants room. Luckily, one of them came through. That was a great relief to",44
NA,"me and to my wife, who was very keen to return to work.",44
NA,We were in a privileged position-my wife returning to work was an optional thing. We,44
NA,"were not in a position where she absolutely had to return to work. I know families where, in",44
NA,"order to pay the family bills, the mother had to get back to work straight after they reached the",44
NA,six-week mark. Luckily we got a place. We have to drive about 15 kilometres to drop our,44
NA,daughter off before we go to work-and we manage it. But we are in a lucky position. In my,44
NA,"region, you have to fight hard to get a childcare spot-and the funding attack in this bill only",44
NA,makes it worse.,44
NA,"Other parts of this attack are really pernicious. For example, the $78 million per annum cut",44
NA,to Indigenous child and family centres will have a direct impact on my region. My seat of,44
NA,"Charlton has a large Indigenous population, particularly on the west side of Lake Macquarie.",44
NA,I have been campaigning to maintain funding for the Nikinpa Aboriginal Child and Family,44
NA,Centre. This is a great Indigenous childcare centre. It is a brand-new centre set up under a,44
NA,national partnership agreement funded by Labor. The only way it survives is through that,44
NA,program's funding and the childcare benefit. Every single family that goes to that centre relies,44
NA,"on the childcare benefit. Their budget is so tight that, if one of their kids drops out, they lose",44
NA,"money. So they are really under the gun, but they are doing great work. They are opposite a",44
NA,primary school that has a lot of Indigenous students. Once the kids who go to the centre turn,44
NA,"three, they get taken across the road to the primary school. They see school assemblies, they",44
NA,go through the library-they get introduced into the culture of schooling before they have to,44
NA,"go there. All the research shows that, for Indigenous families, that is crucial to getting kids to",44
NA,go to school and to prosper in school. All this is under attack from a government that talks,44
NA,about child care but does not believe in it. They talk the talk but they never walk the walk.,44
NA,NA,44
NA,What is worse is that all of this comes out of a poor process. When the minister gets up in,45
NA,"question time, she talks about the importance of the Productivity Commission report. She tells",45
NA,us how they are the government that had the guts to get the Productivity Commission to look,45
NA,into child care and how Labor in government never had the guts to do that. But what is the,45
NA,point of getting the Productivity Commission to look at child care if you have made all your,45
NA,major policy decisions before they even report? Their draft report is not due for another five,45
NA,"weeks, but we have already seen $1 billion worth of cuts to the childcare sector in the",45
NA,meantime. That just shows the hypocrisy of those opposite. They talk about cost-benefit,45
NA,"analysis and they talk about in-depth economic analysis, but when there is a cut to be made",45
NA,they jump in with both feet.,45
NA,They are using the budget yet again as an excuse for these heartless cuts. As speaker after,45
NA,"speaker on this side has pointed out, the budget is built on sand. They have confected a false",45
NA,budget emergency as a basis for pursuing all these heartless cuts. The federal budget is in,45
NA,good shape. We have one of the lowest debt levels in the western world. Debt is projected to,45
NA,peak at less than 20 per cent of GDP-less than a third of the OECD average. Those on the,45
NA,other side have confected this scare campaign in an attempt to fundamentally reshape the,45
NA,nature of Australia-to make it a more dog-eat-dog society-and to attack those on low and,45
NA,"middle incomes, those who are the most vulnerable.",45
NA,This childcare legislation and the cuts it embodies must be viewed in the broader context of,45
NA,the attack on families which this budget represents. The significant cuts in the budget to,45
NA,"family tax benefit part A will mean that, for a family on $60,000 a year with two kids between",45
NA,"eight and 15, there will be a cut in payments of $6,000. These are not Labor figures; these are",45
NA,figures from NATSEM-a modelling organisation of high repute. So highly esteemed are,45
NA,they that the Prime Minister used them before the last election and stated on the public record,45
NA,that they are the premier modellers of family income in this country. They have stated in their,45
NA,"analysis of the budget that a family on $60,000 a year with two kids between eight and 15 will",45
NA,"lose over $6,000. That represents more than 10 per cent of their family income. Just imagine",45
NA,it: you are a family with a combined income less than the average wage and this government,45
NA,"is cutting your family income by $6,000, or 10 per cent. That is a huge blow to families. Then",45
NA,you combine that with the attacks on child care-the kids in that family may have out-of-,45
NA,school child care-which this government has cut by $450 million.,45
NA,This really is a government that does not care about families. They claim that they are,45
NA,"family friendly, but when you look at their actions rather than their rhetoric, they are found",45
NA,wanting. This attack on families is even more hollow when you look at their ridiculous paid,45
NA,"parental leave scheme, a scheme worth over $5 billion a year-which, as the member for",45
NA,"Parramatta pointed out, well exceeds the cuts they are subjecting the childcare sector to.",45
NA,This is a paid parental leave scheme that is grossly inequitable. Figures derived from the,45
NA,"Parliamentary Library show that 80 per cent of women of child-bearing age, in my seat of",45
NA,"Charlton, earn less than $42,000. That includes welfare transfers from the government. So 80",45
NA,"per cent of women in Charlton will receive less than $20,000 under Mr Abbott's ridiculous",45
NA,"paid parental leave scheme. Why is it fair for a family in Charlton to receive less than $20,000",45
NA,"to have a baby while someone in North Sydney or Warringah receives $50,000? Why are the",45
NA,"babies of Charlton worth $30,000 less than the babies of North Sydney? They are not, but it",45
NA,shows the gross inequity of this government and the skewed priorities.,45
NA,NA,45
NA,It also shows that they are happy to rely on the Productivity Commission for some things,46
NA,but not for others. The Productivity Commission made it very clear that a minimum-wage,46
NA,system rather than a replacement-wage system was the most effective way of undertaking,46
NA,paid parental leave. It is the best way of providing incentives for workforce participation by,46
NA,"women, particularly women in lowand middle-income jobs. They are the ones we really",46
NA,"need to give an incentive to, to return to work.",46
NA,We hear ridiculous rhetoric from the other side that it is a workplace entitlement. I,46
NA,challenge them to find another workplace entitlement paid by the government. It is not a,46
NA,"workplace entitlement, it is a welfare measure, and every Australian woman should be",46
NA,entitled to the same amount of welfare for having a baby. This paid parental leave scheme,46
NA,"does not deliver that; in fact, it goes in the opposite direction, where the richer you are the",46
NA,more you get.,46
NA,We need to contrast this with the government's attacks on the childcare sector. The Grattan,46
NA,"Institute, another good economic organisation-they do not always agree with what Labor",46
NA,"does but they are serious, economic policy advisers-have found that investment in child care",46
NA,is twice as effective as investment in the paid parental leave scheme. As the member for,46
NA,"Parramatta said before, it is not just the first six months of a child's life that you need to invest",46
NA,in. You need to invest in their entire life and you need to encourage workforce participation,46
NA,"beyond the first six months. Investing in child care is worth twice as much, is twice as",46
NA,"effective, as investment in the paid parental leave scheme.",46
NA,That really is the nub of this debate: $5½ billion a year on a paid parental leave scheme that,46
NA,rewards millionaires over lowand middle-income Australians is patently unfair. It is also,46
NA,unfair if you look at the opportunity cost. The opportunity cost means that with the $5½,46
NA,"billion you could be well and truly avoiding the cuts to child care. In fact, you could be",46
NA,"doubling what is currently invested in the childcare sector, making our childcare centres",46
NA,"palaces, making them great places for kids to get the best start in life. Instead, we see the",46
NA,"other side pursuing a narrow ideological agenda, where they want to attack any assistance for",46
NA,lowand middle-income families-just as they want to attack pensioners and unemployed,46
NA,people.,46
NA,This is a government that claims to have a small-government mentality and be ending the,46
NA,age of entitlement. They are ending the age of entitlement for lowand middle-income,46
NA,"Australians, they are ending the age of entitlement for pensioners, but they are not ending the",46
NA,age of entitlement for millionaires. That is the great tragedy of the Australia we find at the,46
NA,moment.,46
NA,This is a debate we should not be having in this place. We all agree that investment in child,46
NA,care is great. We all agree that we want to give our kids the best start in life. I say to the,46
NA,"Liberal-National coalition: match your words with action. Invest in child care, invest in giving",46
NA,"our kids the best start in life, because this bill is not that. This bill is an attack on families. It is",46
NA,"an attack on lowand middle-income kids. It is an attack on giving our kids, Australian kids,",46
NA,the best start in life. That is why Labor's amendments should be agreed to.,46
Dr CHALMERS ,Rankin) (10:56): I also support the member for Adelaide's amendment.,46
NA,I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the bill and follow the wise words of my colleague,46
NA,the member for Charlton and my other colleagues the member for Griffith and the member for,46
NA,NA,46
NA,Parramatta. I also thought the member for Lalor made a characteristically thoughtful,47
NA,contribution last night.,47
NA,"I begin my own contribution by paying tribute to childcare workers. In my own electorate,",47
NA,"like so many of the electorates in this place, we are very fortunate to have some tremendous",47
NA,childcare centres full of people whose contribution and commitment to raising the next,47
NA,"generation of Australians is faultless. On Chatswood Road, you can go past one of the centres",47
NA,"in the morning-even before the sun comes up, if you are on a walk or a run-and see the",47
NA,childcare workers out there sweeping the astroturf. They are making sure they are there early,47
NA,enough so that when the tradie utes pull up with the young boys and girls to be dropped off to,47
NA,the childcare centre there is someone waiting for them and someone to care for them.,47
NA,"I am very blessed. I have two wonderful sisters, and one of them is a childcare worker. She",47
NA,"used to run one of the child care centres in my own electorate, at Algester. I know from",47
NA,"speaking to her, over the years, the extraordinary commitment of these childcare workers.",47
NA,"Even though they are not paid a great deal of money, I know that they often dip their hands",47
NA,into their own pockets to pay for the crayons or the butchers paper. I know they often do,47
NA,special things for the kids' birthdays out of their own pockets. I pay tribute to the types of,47
NA,"people that my sister Chelley works with, because I do know they are fantastic people. You",47
NA,cannot say enough about their commitment and contribution to helping raise that next,47
NA,generation of Australians.,47
NA,"In my own electorate, there are something like 11,100 families who rely on child care.",47
NA,"There are 147 approved services and something like 9,760 families who rely on the childcare",47
NA,"rebate, which is one of the things we are talking about today. These are good people who",47
NA,"want to be good parents and good workers, all at the same time. They are people who are just",47
NA,"trying to make ends meet and, quite often, that means having access to good-quality and",47
NA,affordable child care.,47
NA,"This government had two very different themes before and after the election, when it",47
NA,"comes to these sorts of issues. Before the election, they talked about being a government of no",47
NA,surprises. They talked about no cuts to education. They talked about being consultative. They,47
NA,"sent all kinds of reassuring letters to childcare centres, pretending they had no plans to cut",47
NA,"people's assistance when it came to the childcare system. After the election, of course, a very",47
NA,different theme emerged.,47
NA,We should not mince words about the theme that emerged after the election. It really is an,47
NA,unfair agenda. It is a deliberate attack. It is an ambush on people who want to access that,47
NA,good-quality child care at affordable prices. They are people who are just trying to make ends,47
NA,"meet. In lots of ways it was less of a budget and more of an ambush that we saw, in this place,",47
NA,delivered by the Treasurer in May.,47
NA,The more kind interpretation of all of this would be to blame it in some way on ignorance,47
NA,"or something like that, but the reality is that the government are not ignorant of the impact of",47
NA,"these changes. They did not even care to ask what the impact would be, particularly on low-",47
NA,"and middle-income families. It is unforgivable, to my mind, to think that they did not even",47
NA,"ask any of their experts, 'What would this mean for people who are doing it tough in our",47
NA,"community, who are trying to be good parents and good workers?' You would think that",47
NA,would be the very least that they could do. The fact that they did not ask for that kind of,47
NA,advice really does speak to their lack of care about this issue.,47
NA,NA,47
NA,There are people behind every policy change that is made. Every number that is on the,48
NA,page of a budget document represents an impact on a human being and an impact on their,48
NA,community. It is crucial to understand just who this policy change proposed by the,48
NA,"government hurts. It is not accidental; it is deliberate, it is intentional and it is by design. It is",48
NA,another example of the burden of this so-called budget emergency-which is a con-being,48
NA,unfairly borne by the people who can least afford it.,48
NA,We get a bit of a hint of their thinking on some of these matters when we consider that the,48
NA,Prime Minister really does think that there are two kinds of women in the workforce. We,48
NA,know this because of his comment not that long ago which tried to differentiate women of,48
NA,"calibre and, by implication, women who are not of calibre. This was a really Romney-like",48
NA,moment. You will remember Mitt Romney talking about binders full of women when he was,48
NA,trying to defend himself against some of the allegations made in his own presidential,48
NA,campaign. Mitt Romney and Tony Abbott really are Downton Abbey brothers in arms when it,48
NA,comes to these sorts of issues. We know that the Prime Minister has a view that there are,48
NA,some deserving women and some undeserving women. We know this especially in the case of,48
NA,the Paid Parental Leave Scheme.,48
NA,I thought that those who spoke on this legislation before me did an extraordinary job of,48
NA,pointing to the unfairness in the government's Paid Parental Leave Scheme. The member for,48
NA,"Griffith explained it well in referring to it as a really regressive measure. It is not fair, when",48
NA,"you have limited funds coming into the government, when you have budget constraints, to",48
NA,"think that their highest priority would be $21 billion so that they can give $50,000 a year to",48
NA,the wealthiest parents in our community just to have a baby. It is extraordinary that they,48
NA,would prioritise that over some of the assistance that we are talking about today. It just shows,48
NA,how warped those priorities are. It is not just Labor saying that and it is not just the union,48
NA,saying that-as important and as crucial as the union is in looking after childcare workers.,48
NA,There is a whole range of stakeholders who are saying that.,48
NA,"I want to mention again, as other speakers have, that the Australian Industry Group argued",48
NA,that the cuts would not be necessary if some of the expenditure allocated to the government's,48
NA,Paid Parental Leave Scheme was redirected. You would think that would be a no-brainer.,48
NA,When you look at the unfairness of the PPL and the extravagance of that scheme compared,48
NA,"with the unfairness of some of the things being proposed here, you would think that would be",48
NA,"a no-brainer. It was not just the AiG who opposed this bill. Early Childhood Australia, Family",48
NA,"Day Care Australia, Early Learning Association Australia, Australian Childcare Alliance,",48
NA,Goodstart Early Learning and the National Welfare Rights Network have all lined up. There,48
NA,is a long queue of people who think that this legislation has been rushed and that it needs,48
NA,more consideration and that it is not right to attack people on low and middle incomes who,48
NA,are just trying to access affordable child care. These groups cannot understand-just like big,48
NA,"swathes of the community cannot understand-why there is a need to rush. Why the rush,",48
NA,from a government that said 'no surprises'? I can shed some light on that.,48
NA,As other speakers have reminded us-the member for Charlton mentioned this in his,48
NA,contribution-the Productivity Commission will report on some of these issues firstly in July,48
NA,and then I think in October. You would think the government would wait for the outcomes of,48
NA,that review before they made these changes. There are two reasons why they have not. The,48
NA,first reason is very sneaky. They have given a commitment that the Productivity Commission,48
NA,NA,48
NA,will come up with proposals that relate to the same sized funding envelope as we began with.,49
NA,They have rushed in $1 billion worth of cuts so that the envelope is substantially smaller for,49
NA,the Productivity Commission to report on. That would not be well known out in the,49
NA,"community, but that is a sneaky thing that they are doing. I think the second sneaky reason is",49
NA,"appreciated in the community, judging by all the doors I knocked on on the weekend in",49
NA,"Meadowbrook in my electorate, plus the forum we held in Browns Plains. When people talk",49
NA,"about this budget they say, 'What is the government thinking?'",49
Mr Hunt, We are thinking of the $240 billion in deficits that accumulated while you were,49
NA,advising the Treasurer.,49
Dr CHALMERS, Some of them say-and I certainly believe this as well-that what the,49
NA,government are trying to do is place a big bet that all this nasty stuff they are doing to,49
NA,Australians now will be forgotten in two years time. That is all it is. That is why they are,49
NA,rushing out these regressive changes before they even get the outcomes of their own review.,49
Mr Hunt, We are thinking that the kids will have to pay for it if we don't pay for it now.,49
Dr CHALMERS," I would have thought the Minister for the Environment, who is at the",49
NA,"table, would be up for some empirical policy advice-obviously not, judging by the",49
NA,interventions being made as he makes his way through his big stack of folders.,49
NA,The rush to make these cuts is really a political strategy. It does sell Australian mums and,49
NA,dads short. It does attack their living standards. The government try and justify it by a budget,49
NA,"emergency that does not exist, if you listen to credible people, like the International Monetary",49
NA,"Fund. If the government had an economic strategy, we would not be debating these cuts.",49
NA,"Unfortunately, these cuts are not the only cuts that they propose to the childcare system.",49
NA,"Others have spoken about a series of cuts that add up to around $1 billion, whether it is the",49
NA,"$450 million for outside school hours care, the $157 million for family day care services, the",49
NA,funding that has gone from Indigenous child and family centres or the $300 million in support,49
NA,"for educator wages-the people I began my contribution by talking about, the great people",49
NA,"who look after our kids in the community. Now, of course, we have this attack on the absolute",49
NA,backbone of the childcare system: the CCR and of the CCB. We know from the education,49
NA,department that the combination of measures that we are debating now will hurt half a million,49
NA,"lowand middle-income families, who will receive less support as a result of this measure.",49
NA,"The member for Griffith paid tribute to former Prime Minister Rudd, and I pay tribute to",49
NA,him as well and to former Prime Minister Gillard and all the ministers who were in this,49
NA,"portfolio, including the member for Adelaide and others, who did such a tremendous job in",49
NA,this policy area.,49
NA,Ms Kate Ellis: Tell me more!,49
Dr CHALMERS," The member for Adelaide would like to know more about this, so I will",49
NA,"tell her more. One of the first actions of the new Labor government in 2007, as she would",49
NA,"know, was to increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and to increase the",49
NA,"CCR cap. We also gave families the option of claiming the CCR payment fortnightly, which",49
NA,made a big difference-and there are all kinds of stats that others have spoken about.,49
NA,Modelling showed that out-of-pocket costs for a family earning 75 grand a year reduced from,49
NA,13 per cent of their disposable income in 2004 to 8.4 per cent in 2012. There are reams and,49
NA,reams of stats like this to show what an extraordinary success Labor's childcare policies were,49
NA,NA,49
NA,in government. We are very proud of these achievements not just because of the impact that,50
NA,they had on the childcare system and that they had on people's disposable income and their,50
NA,capacity to make ends meet but also because they were a contribution to the type of economy,50
NA,"that we want in this country. We want an economy where more people participate, where",50
NA,"more people benefit, where the gains of economic growth are more broadly and fairly shared.",50
NA,We make it easier for people to be simultaneously good workers and good parents.,50
NA,"The member for Adelaide has mentioned a compelling stat, and it is worth mentioning",50
NA,again. Research shows that the relationship between childcare affordability and women's,50
NA,workforce participation is strong. A one per cent increase in the gross childcare price results,50
NA,"in a decrease to mothers' employment rate of 0.7 per cent. That is a substantial, concrete piece",50
NA,of evidence about the impact that these sorts of measures that are being proposed can have on,50
NA,participation in our economy. Lower income families have been proven to be the first to drop,50
NA,out of work as childcare costs increase. I have a lot of lower income families in my electorate.,50
NA,I am proud to represent them. One of the reasons I wanted to speak on this is that the changes,50
NA,that are being proposed would have a disproportionate impact on those people that I am so,50
NA,"proud to represent. As the member for Charlton said, you cannot just talk the talk of",50
NA,workforce participation; you need to walk the walk if you are fair dinkum about workforce,50
NA,participation. It is on measures like this that the rubber really hits the road.,50
NA,We have workforce challenges associated with the ageing of the population and all kinds of,50
NA,things. Participation is one of those workforce challenges. The participation rate has been,50
NA,"bouncing around-in the last ABS data, I think it dropped down a little bit. In the long term,",50
NA,we have big challenges associated with finding the right amount of workers to support a,50
NA,growing proportion of retirees in our economy. That is why this debate is so crucial. If we,50
NA,"make dads and especially mums choose between being good workers or good parents, we are",50
NA,selling them short. We are selling short their contribution to a stronger economy.,50
NA,"Labor is proud of its record in government. This bill should be split, as the member for",50
NA,"Adelaide's amendment proposes, because we should consider the changes to the child care",50
NA,benefit separately. We will oppose the bill if it is not split. This bill is a backward step. Like,50
NA,"so many other things in the budget, it is contrary to the guarantees the government gave",50
NA,families before the election. To all of those childcare workers and parents relying on the,50
NA,childcare system in my part of the world in Logan City and some of the surrounding Brisbane,50
NA,"suburbs, I want you to know that this side of the House is standing up for people on lowand",50
NA,"middle-incomes in the childcare system. We are standing up for childcare workers, like my",50
NA,"sister Chelley. We will continue to do that and that is why I support the member for Adelaide,",50
NA,"who moved this amendment, and all the good people on this side of the House who have",50
NA,spoken in favour of it,50
Mr THISTLETHWAITE ,Kingsford Smith) (11:11): I am pleased to speak in support of,50
NA,"the amendment moved by the member for Adelaide. In doing so, I speak on behalf of 6,850",50
NA,families in the electorate of Kingsford Smith who receive the childcare benefit and the,50
NA,childcare rebate-that much-needed support for affordable child care in our community. I ask,50
NA,representatives of the government: why are you cutting funding for childcare support for,50
NA,families by freezing these two very important payments? Why are you making it harder for,50
NA,"families to make ends meet by making childcare more unaffordable? Why are you doing this,",50
NA,when at the same time you are giving large multinational mining companies in this country a,50
NA,NA,50
NA,tax break? It says everything about the priorities of this government. Why are you not,51
NA,supporting families in a time when cost-of-living pressures are through the roof?,51
NA,Prime Minister Abbott is not the person he said he would be. This government is not the,51
NA,"government that it said it would be prior to the election. Before the election, they made it",51
NA,"clear that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to pensions and no",51
NA,cuts to the ABC and SBS-but in these bills we clearly see a cut to education and a cut to,51
NA,support for early childhood education in our community. It is a clear and continuing broken,51
NA,"election commitment. Before the election, the Prime Minister personally wrote to all childcare",51
NA,centres about the impact of a proposal to cap the childcare rebate. Before the election the,51
NA,"Prime Minister's view, put in writing to those childcare centres, was that capping and freezing",51
NA,"the childcare rebate 'would increase out-of-pocket costs for families.' Yet, this is exactly what",51
NA,his government is doing. The hypocrisy of this government knows no bounds when it comes,51
NA,to the cuts that they have undertaken to education and health and their changes to pensions.,51
NA,"In my community, the cost of living is the No. 1 political issue. It is the No. 1 pressure",51
NA,facing families. Housing costs are astronomical-they have gone through the roof. What is,51
NA,the approach of this government? They apply layer upon layer of additional pressure:,51
NA,implementing GP co-payments so that families will now have to pay every time one of their,51
NA,kids get sick and has to visit the doctor; removing family tax benefits and making it more,51
NA,"difficult, particularly for single-parent families, to make ends meet; cutting the schoolkids",51
NA,"bonus, vital support to families to ensure that they can meet the costs of sending kids to",51
NA,"school; and now, in these bills, they are freezing the childcare rebate and freezing the",51
NA,childcare benefit. There is layer upon layer of more costs and more difficulty for families,51
NA,through these reforms.,51
NA,For many families in my community the Child Care Rebate or the Child Care Benefit is the,51
NA,difference between having a child in child care and not having the child in child care.,51
NA,"Subsequently, it is the difference between the ability of some families to have both parents in",51
NA,the workforce and only one parent in the workforce-and that is very important to cost-of-,51
NA,living pressures and the ability of families to participate actively in society. Freezing these,51
NA,childcare rebates and benefits will make it more difficult for families. That is illustrated by the,51
NA,numbers of people who will reach or have reached the cap for the rebate.,51
NA,The greatest betrayal in this reform is the fact that the savings generated from the freezing,51
NA,of these benefits will not be re-invested in early-childhood development or in the childcare,51
NA,system. They are clear cuts to early-childhood education and clear cuts to benefits and,51
NA,payments to families to help them meet the costs of having kids in child care. That says,51
NA,"everything about this government's priorities, particularly in the context of offering tax breaks",51
NA,to wealthy mining companies and to those who are on large superannuation balances and who,51
NA,earn large incomes from them. It comes on top of cuts to early-childhood education in other,51
NA,areas-$450 million has been cut from the out-of-school-hours care program. In my area a,51
NA,"school like Randwick Primary School, which has 800 students, has a waiting list of 100",51
NA,students-100 families are trying to get their kids into out-of-school care. How happy are,51
NA,they going to be about the cuts that this government is making to out-of-school care? They are,51
NA,going to be extremely pleased that $450 million is being cut when that money could be used,51
NA,to expand the number of positions at places like Randwick Primary School. Such care is,51
NA,"necessary in the context of having both parents work, as modern families do.",51
NA,NA,51
NA,Some $157 million is also being cut from Family Day Care services. Indigenous Family,52
NA,"Day Care centres are facing cuts. One is the Gujuga Family Day Care Service in La Perouse,",52
NA,which I recently visited and which provides a wonderful service to young students. It is,52
NA,"teetering on the edge, because the support they have been receiving from all levels of",52
NA,"government is threatened by the federal cuts; and, no doubt, that will have an impact on the",52
NA,number of places they can provide for Indigenous families.,52
NA,This government's approach to childcare workers is nothing short of disgraceful. Anyone,52
NA,"who has kids in child care, as I do, would know just how hard and important the work of",52
NA,childcare workers is for early childhood development. They are not simply a child-minding,52
NA,"service. Early childhood workers are educators, and numerous studies demonstrate the value",52
NA,of early-childhood development for the ongoing educational capacity of kids and for the,52
NA,"developmental abilities of kids, particularly those with disabilities-the value of early",52
NA,intervention and early education for kids with disabilities is infinite. I see it in my children.,52
NA,"My eldest daughter could read words before kindergarten, because of the support and the",52
NA,"education she was given by the educators in her childcare service. It is a valuable service that,",52
NA,"historically, has been undervalued by the community. Relatively speaking, childcare workers",52
NA,are being paid a pittance when compared to the value of the service they provide for kids and,52
NA,"their development and, ultimately, the productivity of our education system and the economy.",52
NA,The previous government's approach was to say that finally as a society we need to value,52
NA,the work and the role of early childhood educators. We need to highly value the role they play,52
NA,"not only in looking after kids and educating them, but also in the emotional support they",52
NA,"provide. That was evident in the approach taken by the previous Labor government, guided",52
NA,"quite ably by the member for Adelaide, in boosting the wages of childcare workers to ensure",52
NA,they are paid a fair and decent wage.,52
NA,"The greatest betrayal, as I have said, is that the money saved through these cuts is not being",52
NA,re-invested into early-childhood development. That says everything about the approach of this,52
NA,"government and this government's priorities, especially when it provides a tax break for large",52
NA,multinational mining companies and for those with large superannuation balances and when it,52
NA,persists with the $16 billion Paid Parental Leave scheme.,52
NA,The impact of freezing the Child Care Benefits will be monumental for some families. The,52
NA,Child Care Benefit is a targeted payment-it is means tested and starts to reduce once a,52
NA,"family's income reaches $41,000 and cuts out at $145,000 for single-child families. So it is",52
NA,targeted to low-income families to ensure that they have the support and the wherewithal to,52
NA,"send kids to child care. In the Senate inquiry into this particular bill, the Department of",52
NA,"Education admitted that 500,000 families will receive less support for early-childhood",52
NA,education from the changes and the freezing of the Child Care Benefit. This proposal is being,52
NA,rushed through the House and the parliament with very little community consultation. I note,52
NA,that a number of advocacy bodies and people who work day to day in this space are opposed,52
NA,to these changes. Many of those bodies were given only five days to comment on the context,52
NA,and the implications of this bill. Perhaps one of the greatest ironies of this reform is the fact,52
NA,that the Productivity Commission inquiry into early childhood education and learning is still,52
NA,running. One would think that the government would await the outcomes and the,52
NA,recommendations of their own inquiry before jumping to conclusions and rushing through,52
NA,"legislation, without adequate consultation of the wider community and interested parties-",52
NA,NA,52
NA,"but, no, they have adopted this reform. Again, this is another example of a government",53
NA,without a plan and with policy being developed on the run-policy that is being rushed and,53
NA,"that is ill-thought through, particularly on the implications for families.",53
NA,"In terms of the childcare rebate, the impact will again affect a number of families in my",53
NA,community. The childcare rebate is a non means-tested payment that provides 50 per cent of,53
NA,"the out-of-pocket expenses up to $7,500 per child per year. In terms of the cost of freezing the",53
NA,"cap, it has been revealed that 74,000 families will reach the cap in 2014-15 and that that will",53
NA,"increase to 150,000 families in 2016-17. It says everything about the impact moving forward",53
NA,of freezing this benefit on those families for whom childcare will become unaffordable and,53
NA,"more difficult as a result of this reform. In opposition, as I mentioned earlier, the current",53
NA,"government, the Abbott government, opposed freezing the cap. Even when we were planning",53
NA,"to invest that money back into the childcare system, they opposed this reform. But here we",53
NA,have them pushing ahead with this reform. It is a rushed reform. There has been inadequate,53
NA,"consultation, and this is symbolic of the government developing policy on the run.",53
NA,"In conclusion, on behalf of those almost 7,000 families in my community who are feeling",53
NA,"the pinch when it comes to the cost of living, who are struggling to make ends meet and to",53
NA,"ensure that they keep their kids in child care, the childcare rebate and the childcare benefit can",53
NA,mean the difference between having their kid in child care and not having their kid in child,53
NA,care. The freezing of these payments and the rushed manner in which these reforms have been,53
NA,"conducted, particularly in the context of the government's ongoing Productivity Commission",53
NA,"inquiry, is something that the opposition does not support. This is why the minister has sought",53
NA,to split these bills. There has not been adequate consultation in order to get an appropriate,53
NA,response from those in the community who are affected by these reforms and nor have the,53
NA,implications of these reforms been thoroughly thought through.,53
Ms LEY ,"Farrer-Assistant Minister for Education) (11:25): In summing up, I thank all",53
NA,the speakers on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Measures) Bill,53
NA,2014 for their contributions to the debate. I want to reiterate that this government is,53
NA,"committed to making child care more affordable, flexible and accessible for Australian",53
NA,working families. I want to start by making something very clear to address so much of the,53
NA,"misinformation from Labor members during this debate. Overall, this government is",53
NA,"increasing, not cutting, childcare assistance to $28½ billion over the next four years to assist",53
NA,around a million families each year through the childcare benefit and the childcare rebate.,53
NA,The proposed amendments to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care,53
NA,Measures) Bill will do two things: maintain the childcare benefit income thresholds for three,53
NA,"years and continue to pause the childcare rebate limit at $7,500 per child per year for a further",53
NA,three years. Both of these measures will apply from 1 July 2014 for three years to 30 June,53
NA,"2017. It is fiscally responsible for this government to maintain, not cut-as the member for",53
NA,"Adelaide would have you believe-the current CCB income thresholds, along with the",53
NA,"current CCR annual limit, pending the outcome of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into",53
NA,child care and early learning in October 2014. The terms of reference for this broad-ranging,53
NA,inquiry include consideration of rebates and subsidies for child care. The draft report will give,53
NA,us the first insight into their proposed reforms and is due next month.,53
NA,"The measures contained in this bill are, however, moderate and necessary. The Senate",53
NA,Education and Employment Legislation Committee noted:,53
NA,NA,53
NA,"… the committee is persuaded that these measures are limited, well targeted and for a finite period of",54
NA,"time, and are a necessary part of the broader government agenda of repairing the budget and",54
NA,strengthening the economy.,54
NA,The government is making decisions that will prepare Australia for the long-term challenges,54
NA,and opportunities that confront us. The childcare benefit measure in this bill is a 2014-15,54
NA,budget measure and is one element of the government's broader measure to maintain,54
NA,eligibility thresholds for Australian government payments for three years. Maintaining the,54
NA,childcare benefit income thresholds will provide an estimated saving of $230 million over the,54
NA,forward estimates. Childcare benefit eligibility requirements will remain unchanged. This is,54
NA,"not a cut. The government will continue to index-that is, increase the childcare benefit",54
NA,"standard hourly rate, increase the minimum hourly amount and the multiple child loadings by",54
NA,the consumer price index on 1 July each year. It is important to note that the out-of-pocket,54
NA,costs incurred by most families because of the childcare benefit measure will be reduced by,54
NA,"the childcare rebate, which is not income tested and which covers up to 50 per cent of out-of-",54
NA,"pocket childcare costs, up to $7,500 per child per year.",54
NA,"The childcare rebate indexation pause at $7,500 was first implemented by Labor in 2011.",54
NA,Labor announced an extension of the measure as part of their 2013-14 budget and then took,54
NA,the $105 million in savings from the budget bottom line but never legislated for it. When this,54
NA,"government sought to legislate the measure, Labor combined with the Greens in the Senate",54
NA,earlier this year to block the legislation that would have given effect to their own measure. So,54
NA,I welcome their apparent change of mind. It is very good to see that the opposition is no,54
NA,longer opposed to their own measure. The CCB measure will not impact families with,54
NA,"incomes below $41,902, which is the lower income threshold for childcare benefit. These",54
NA,families will continue to receive the maximum rate of childcare benefit. Families with,54
NA,"incomes above $41,902 will continue to receive CCB. The amount of CCB a family receives",54
NA,tapers to zero as their income increases to the relevant maximum income limit. The CCB,54
NA,measure in this bill ensures the payment is fair and sustainable in the longer term for families,54
NA,"who need it most. And I want repeat this, because families need to be aware-despite the",54
NA,broad-brush accusations of the opposition-that the hourly and weekly rates of Child Care,54
NA,"Benefit will continue to be indexed-that is, to increase. This means that, per hour, the",54
NA,amount of Child Care Benefit that families receive will in fact continue to increase.,54
NA,A number of members opposite referred to the Productivity Commission's inquiry called by,54
NA,"this government. We actually called for it in opposition, but it was never supported by Labor.",54
NA,"They have talked it up today-and I am delighted that they have-but they never, ever",54
NA,"supported its inception. As I have said, the measures in this bill do not in any way pre-empt",54
NA,"the Productivity Commission inquiry into child care and early childhood learning, which is a",54
NA,"holistic review into what is needed for the next generation, not just for the next few years. We",54
NA,"are maintaining the current CCB income thresholds, along with the current CCR annual limit,",54
NA,"pending the outcome of the Productivity Commission's inquiry, which will report finally in",54
NA,"October of this year. As part of its broad-ranging review, the PC is looking into the rebates",54
NA,and subsidies available for each type of care. The inquiry's fourth term of reference,54
NA,specifically asks the commission to look into:,54
NA,Options for enhancing the choices available to Australian families as to how they receive child care,54
NA,"support, so that this can occur in the manner most suitable to their individual family circumstances.",54
NA,"Mechanisms to be considered include subsidies, rebates and tax deductions, to improve the",54
NA,NA,54
NA,"accessibility, flexibility and affordability of child care for families facing diverse individual",55
NA,circumstances.,55
NA,"Thousands of submissions and comments have been received, and a number of them have",55
NA,highlighted just how complex these payments are for families and service providers alike. So,55
NA,I really do look forward to the Productivity Commission's draft report next month. But the,55
NA,CCB and CCR measures in this bill are moderate and necessary measures for this time.,55
NA,"Of course, I would have preferred that we, coming into government, did not have to make",55
NA,"these changes. Of course, I would have preferred that we did not inherit a budget disaster",55
NA,"from Labor which needed urgent action to repair it. Of course, I would have preferred not to",55
NA,"be standing here today to sum up a bill that brings in sensible, moderate measures to repair the",55
NA,"budget. These are choices that the Liberal and National parties, in government, have been",55
NA,forced to make-by the budget mess left to us by Labor.,55
NA,We know that Australian families need flexibility. We know that our Productivity,55
NA,"Commission inquiry is going to deliver some real, valuable and terrific policy ideas for the",55
NA,next generation. I am delighted that the Productivity Commission will look at the options for,55
NA,"the future, within the current funding envelope. I remind the House that the Productivity",55
NA,"Commission inquiry is a broad-ranging one, and that one of its terms of reference is to look at",55
NA,"the current and future needs for child care in Australia, including the consideration of a",55
NA,number of factors such as the 'types of child care available including but not limited to: long,55
NA,"day care, family day care, in-home care including nannies and au pairs, mobile care,",55
NA,"occasional care, and outside-school-hours care'. I make that point because a number of",55
NA,members opposite have highlighted in their speeches the difficulties that they themselves have,55
NA,experienced in finding child care. They have highlighted the difficulties that their constituents,55
NA,"face, and they have highlighted the frustrations of not finding the right child care, in the right",55
NA,"place, at the right time, and for the right cost. We definitely want to reiterate our commitment",55
NA,"to solving this problem. We came into government and inherited a childcare system that, if",55
NA,"not completely broken, was certainly heading in that direction. The urgent action that we are",55
NA,taking in terms of repairing the budget is something that will set our economy on a good,55
NA,footing for the next generation. Our inquiry will look at innovative ideas for policies in child,55
NA,care.,55
NA,"I do want to mention something else that a number of those opposite talked about, which is",55
NA,"cuts to the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance-wrong. The program is",55
NA,currently uncapped as to how much parents can claim. Labor's inaction has seen the,55
NA,JETCCFA budget blow out by over $50 million in the past two years. The Australian,55
NA,government is introducing two key changes commencing on 5 January next year: a maximum,55
NA,"eight-dollar hourly cap for Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance, and a 36-",55
NA,hour weekly limit per child to payments to recipients who are undertaking study. The average,55
NA,"childcare hours used by all families working or studying is around 24 hours a week, and the",55
NA,average hourly fee for all families is $7.65 per child-so most families will find no change to,55
NA,"their current situation. For example, with the average childcare hours used by all families",55
NA,"working or studying being around 24 hours a week, the 36-hour weekly limit will mean no",55
NA,change to most families' current situations. We are introducing these changes to better manage,55
NA,expenditure and to ensure that recipients are accessing the program in the most cost-effective,55
NA,way. We want to ensure that JET fee assistance is available for as many income support,55
NA,NA,55
NA,"families as possible, to enable them to get the skills they need so that they can secure jobs",56
NA,now and into the future.,56
NA,The member for Adelaide spoke of what she termed as 'cuts to family day care'-and I do,56
NA,"need to mention this because she was, in fact, the minister during 2012, when an audit of the",56
NA,Community Support Program by the Australian National Audit Office found approximately,56
NA,71 per cent of CSP funding was being allocated to family day care-which accounted for,56
NA,approximately 10 per cent of all children in care. The ANAO recommended that the,56
NA,"program's eligibility criteria be reviewed but, typically, Labor did nothing. So the member for",56
NA,"Adelaide knows that the program was unsustainable; she knew it in government, but did",56
NA,nothing to repair the situation when she had the chance. She squibbed her responsibilities and,56
NA,now sits on the other side and criticises this government for what we are doing to fix Labor's,56
NA,mess.,56
NA,Labor has no credibility on child care. The promises that they made never came to fruition.,56
NA,"In fact, childcare fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent under Labor-that is, around $73 extra a",56
NA,"week in fees for a family using the average hours of child care. In case members opposite say,",56
NA,"'oh yes, but that is before you factor in the subsidies to parents for the Child Care Rebate', let",56
NA,me make the point that out-of-pocket costs went up 40 per cent during that time. That in itself,56
NA,is a disastrous legacy to leave Australian families. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. I know that,56
NA,"is a phrase we hear a lot in this House, but in fact, in this case, their hypocrisy is breathtaking.",56
NA,We will soon see that the Labor Party will oppose this bill-this bill that is designed to repair,56
NA,a budget disaster that they left us with. But in this bill is a measure that they in fact announced,56
NA,"in their budget but from which they took $106 million in savings, and they assumed that cut",56
NA,"would happen. They will sit here and oppose their own measure, which in itself is",56
NA,"extraordinary, because Labor members speaking on this bill have been hysterically wrong in",56
NA,"so many instances. They say 'You are making cuts', 'You do not care', 'You are not interested',",56
NA,"'Children do not matter', and so on-there has not really been a rationale presented by",56
NA,members opposite for why we would do these things.,56
NA,"In the battle of ideas, there are often competing ideas. You might have different ideas about",56
NA,"a range of philosophies and policies, but no Labor member has actually accused us of having",56
NA,"a different idea. All they have accused us of is making cuts, and the reason is that they know",56
NA,"the only rationale, the only reason, why we are doing these things is that we have no choice in",56
NA,the context of the budget that we have inherited. Labor just make up stories and scaremonger.,56
NA,Those listening to this debate may think that the amount of childcare benefit they receive for,56
NA,"their children, the hourly amount, is going down, when in fact it is going up, because all we",56
NA,are doing is freezing thresholds. They might think that the amount of childcare rebate they can,56
NA,"claim is going down, when in fact we are pausing the threshold. We are pausing these",56
NA,"thresholds for three years to take the moderate, sensible action that we need to to restore the",56
NA,national accounts of this country.,56
NA,"As I said, we have a plan, we have an agenda, we have ideas and we understand the",56
NA,landscape in which we exist and in which we work. We understand what parents need. We,56
NA,know that our Productivity Commission inquiry is going to look after those needs for the next,56
NA,generation. The accusation by a Labor Party that did not even support that inquiry of not,56
NA,"waiting until that inquiry report is in, unfortunately a few months from now, fails to",56
NA,NA,56
NA,understand that this action is being taken in order to repair the budget and that means that we,57
NA,have a limited choice.,57
NA,"I want to commend this bill to the House, I want to reiterate that the childcare rebate",57
NA,measures in this bill are in fact Labor's own measures. They are Labor's own measures. They,57
NA,"need to own up, they need to stand up and they need to say 'we will support this part of the",57
NA,"bill.' If they oppose this whole bill, then they cannot be taken seriously as a responsible",57
NA,"opposition. If they oppose this whole bill, they are effectively opposing something they",57
NA,"introduced themselves, and from which they took $106 million in savings to try, desperately,",57
NA,to provide that economic fig leaf of credibility that they had lurched to the last election with.,57
NA,How dishonest; how meaningless. It is absolutely appalling that Labor would not recognise,57
NA,that they in fact own half of the legislation that is being presented today. I commend the bill,57
NA,to the House.,57
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Vasta): The original question was that this bill now be,57

NA,Second Reading,60
NA,Cognate debate.,60
NA,Debate resumed on the motion:,60
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,60
Mr ALBANESE ,Grayndler) (11:58): The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 is a part of the,60
NA,Abbott government's ongoing attempt to con Australians about the level of its commitment to,60
NA,"infrastructure investment. On a superficial level, it sounds like the government is doing",60
NA,"something. Indeed, part this legislation creates a fund which the government proposes to fund",60
NA,new infrastructure proposals in the 2014-15 budget.,60
NA,But there is a real problem here. The budget includes no new money for infrastructure. The,60
NA,few new projects are being funded by cuts to existing road and rail projects. But more than,60
NA,"anything else, this bill is about an attempt by the Commonwealth to flick pass responsibility",60
NA,for nation-building to state governments. This will be done using the centrepiece of this,60
NA,NA,60
NA,"legislation, the $5 billion so-called Infrastructure Recycling Initiative. This fund will be",61
NA,available for two years. State governments willing to privatise public assets and spend the,61
NA,proceeds on infrastructure projects will be eligible to access the fund for a 15 per cent,61
NA,premium on the price of the project. The creation of this fund mirrors the political story of the,61
NA,"entire 2014-15 budget. It is a story about a Prime Minister who is cutting spending, because",61
NA,"he is obsessed with small government. At the same time, he is attempting to paint himself as a",61
NA,"high-rolling big spender on infrastructure. Because of the incompatibility of these positions,",61
NA,the Prime Minister is desperate to pass responsibility for cuts onto other levels of government.,61
NA,"Last month's budget was something of a masterclass in the flick pass. For example, the $80",61
NA,"billion in cuts to health and education spending are federal cuts, but the states will have to",61
NA,deliver them. They will have to bear the political backlash out there in the community while,61
NA,the Prime Minister washes his hand and demands public acclaim for fiscal rectitude. In the,61
NA,"same way, cash-strapped councils will have to wear the political pain of the Prime Minister's",61
NA,billion dollars in cuts to financial assistance grants to councils.,61
NA,The legislation before us is of apiece with this buck-passing mentality. It seeks to impose,61
NA,greater responsibility for infrastructure on states while this coalition government seeks the,61
NA,credit. The funding sphere is a political minefield of privatisation of public assets. The extent,61
NA,to which this is a political issue is highlighted by the fact that it is not called a privatisation,61
NA,initiative; it is called recycling where states will be asked to take significant political risks for,61
NA,the privilege of accessing a 15 per cent bonus. This asset recycling initiative is a fancy-,61
NA,sounding name for privatisation of state assets and a reduction of Commonwealth spending on,61
NA,infrastructure.,61
NA,I notice that the government claims that the $5.9 billion that will go into this proposed fund,61
NA,is new. That is blatantly untrue. The $5.9 billion was stolen from two existing infrastructure,61
NA,"investment funds. The first, the Building Australia Fund, was established by Labor to provide",61
NA,"investment in transport, communications, energy and water infrastructure. The second, the",61
NA,"Education Investment Fund, was also created by Labor and was designed to fund",61
NA,infrastructure investment in education and research.,61
NA,The abolition of the Education Investment Fund comes on top of its $5.8 billion of cuts to,61
NA,higher education and student support. The abolition raises serious questions about this,61
NA,government's commitment to the long-term sustainable funding of infrastructure for teaching,61
NA,and research at Australia' public universities. Without systematic and sustainable funding for,61
NA,"research infrastructure, Australia will not be able to attract the best and brightest researchers",61
NA,in the world nor commit to significant long-term research and commercialisation projects,61
NA,done by our competitors.,61
NA,"The Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund delivered real, direct",61
NA,investment in productivity-driving infrastructure. Decisions about grants from these funds,61
NA,were subject to rigorous process. Projects funded from the Building Australia Fund had to be,61
NA,ticked off by the independent Infrastructure Australia to ensure that investments had genuine,61
NA,"potential to add to national productivity. In the case of the Education Investment Fund, a",61
NA,specialist committee of independent experts exercised similar oversight and the previous,61
NA,government acted on the expert advice.,61
NA,The infrastructure recycling initiative is being presented today as a new means to leverage,61
NA,"extra investment-that is, investment that would otherwise not occur-but it is a con. The",61
NA,NA,61
NA,"fund itself is being bankrolled by a raid on the two existing investment vehicles, not a single",62
NA,"new dollar, as a result of this legislation that is before the parliament today.",62
NA,Let me put it another way: the government is dumping plans for actual direct investment in,62
NA,"nation building and will use the money gained to pay the states to do its job. So, whether it is",62
NA,hard infrastructure in terms of transport infrastructure or investment in science and education,62
NA,"institutions to boost our contribution to productivity, this government is abandoning both in",62
NA,terms of direct investment.,62
NA,Let me say again that the Commonwealth contribution to projects bankrolled by this fund,62
NA,"will be the 15 per cent premium on the value of the infrastructure project but, under existing",62
NA,"arrangements, the Commonwealth consideration to infrastructure projects is either a fifty-fifty",62
NA,share with the states or in some cases an 80-20 split. So let's be honest: this fund is a cost-,62
NA,"cutting measure at least as it relates to the Commonwealth budget. Most importantly, there are",62
NA,no checks and balances in this legislation to ensure that the projects funded by this asset,62
NA,recycling fund represent value for many. That is why the opposition today will be proposing,62
NA,amendments aimed at restoring the proper processes in decision making about infrastructure.,62
NA,The fund is an emblem for this government's political cowardice and lack of vision both,62
NA,when it comes to actual investment and to probity standards. The term 'asset recycling' is a,62
NA,different way of saying privatisation: the sale of existing public assets that are owned by the,62
NA,"Australian people. I am neither for or against privatisation full stop, but it must be considered",62
NA,on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes it might be appropriate to sell a public asset but it is,62
NA,always vital to balance the short-term benefit of selling assets against the long-term downside,62
NA,"of losing the revenue stream for that asset. Once the asset is sold as a one-off, the revenue",62
NA,"stream is gone, so you can weaken the long-term fiscal position of government through a",62
NA,short term act. That is why privatisation is not always popular with voters. It involves real,62
NA,political risks. Taxpayers are sensitive about the idea of what some people call selling off the,62
NA,family silver. They know that in many cases a windfall gain is made at the cost of a long-term,62
NA,revenue stream.,62
NA,The Prime Minister understands the political risks involved in privatisation for state,62
NA,"governments, so he knows that the sting of any voter backlash associated with this fund will",62
NA,"be felt by the states, not the Commonwealth. It is a case of all care but no responsibility. I",62
NA,"predict that future public complaints by state governments, particularly by coalition",62
NA,"governments, about inadequate roads or public transport will be met by a standard prime",62
NA,"ministerial response from the government, 'It's not my fault. It's the fault of the states.' I",62
NA,"offered them access to the Asset Recycling Fund, which was already in place in terms of",62
NA,money with the Building Australia Fund and the education infrastructure funding. This is just,62
NA,part of the mirage that was the government's so-called infrastructure initiatives in the budget,62
NA,"in May, and you do not need to be Nostradamus to make this prediction.",62
NA,I watched for nearly a dozen wasted years as John Howard amassed a massive,62
NA,infrastructure deficit by behaving as though infrastructure was none of his business. When I,62
NA,"was sworn in as infrastructure minister, Australia was ranked 20th in the OECD for",62
NA,"investment in infrastructure as a proportion of GDP. When I left, we were first as a result of",62
NA,the record investment that the federal Labor government put into nation building. Mr Howard,62
NA,was a determined federalist who provided no leadership on nation building. He found it easier,62
NA,"to use surpluses, driven by the mining boom, to curry electoral favour with middle-class",62
NA,NA,62
NA,"welfare than to actually invest in the future of this nation. After all, state premiers were",63
NA,always on hand to use as whipping boys if anyone complained about inadequate,63
NA,infrastructure. We have already seen it with this government's approach to public transport,63
NA,infrastructure where they have withdrawn every single dollar from every public transport,63
NA,project around the nation that was not already under construction.,63
NA,The coalition's preparedness to identify problems is exceeded only by their enthusiasm for,63
NA,"passing them onto other levels of government. Rather than achieving actual progress, the",63
NA,government would rather retain power by dissolving lines of government responsibility and,63
NA,"by playing the blame-game. While Labor builds the nation for the benefit of all, those",63
NA,opposite oppose nation building and actually have legislation before the Senate to remove the,63
NA,term 'nation building' from any involvement in infrastructure. They believe that infrastructure,63
NA,is just about marginal electorates.,63
NA,"Another problem with this new fund is its potential to distort the infrastructure market,",63
NA,because the window of opportunity for the privatisation of state assets is only two years and,63
NA,could encourage fire sales. It could give states an incentive to make poor decisions in their,63
NA,haste to get a piece of this action. This fund could lead to a crowding out of the infrastructure,63
NA,market for two years. Where you have more possibilities for investment than would otherwise,63
NA,"be the case at the one time, you will get a lower price to taxpayers from the sale of those",63
NA,"assets. Again, that is not a problem for the federal government, but it would be a problem for",63
NA,state governments.,63
NA,The question of how governments fund infrastructure is always critical. In office Labor,63
NA,worked with states to deliver funding for their proposals. We also created taxation,63
NA,arrangements designed to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure-,63
NA,"arrangements that this government has made no effort to utilise. Above all, we had faith that",63
NA,our creation of Infrastructure Australia to provide proper process for infrastructure decision,63
NA,making meant that our projects would add to national productivity. They were projects that,63
NA,yield productivity gains for themselves over time. They create jobs and they create economic,63
NA,"activity that boosts government revenues. Some, like investments in urban rail, add to the",63
NA,amenity of cities and drive further productivity gains. They encourage people to leave their,63
NA,cars at home or move closer to their workplaces. That is why we funded all 15 projects that,63
NA,were identified as a priority by Infrastructure Australia. Whether it be projects like the Majura,63
NA,"Parkway, or the Hunter Expressway, or whether it be rail projects like the regional rail link,",63
NA,we funded them on the basis of proper advice.,63
NA,"The Prime Minister, though, has put forward a budget in which none of the new projects",63
NA,that have been funded have been identified as priority projects by Infrastructure Australia. At,63
NA,the same time the Prime Minister believes that changes put forward to the Infrastructure,63
NA,"Australia legislation would undermine its independence, and we are seeking to move",63
NA,amendments in the Senate to fix up this flawed legislation.,63
NA,The government's approach to infrastructure spending in the 2014-15 budget is wildly out,63
NA,"of kilter with their rhetoric. If you judge the Prime Minister by his words, you might believe",63
NA,that he was committed to infrastructure investment. He has been out there with re-,63
NA,announcement after re-announcement claiming that projects that had been underway for years,63
NA,"were somehow new. We heard the Deputy Prime Minister, yesterday, trying to claim the",63
NA,"Moreton Bay Rail Link, which was first promised in the Queensland parliament in 1895. But",63
NA,NA,63
NA,it took a federal Labor government in partnership with the Queensland state Labor,64
NA,"government and the local council to ensure that it occurred. In terms of that, the fact is they",64
NA,"have announced projects which were funded in budgets by the previous Labor government,",64
NA,"including the Inland Rail project. The study was done, the commitment was given in 2010 and",64
NA,funding of $300 million was in the 2011 budget for the Inland Rail line. They have announced,64
NA,"exactly the same funding, exactly the same time frame, and they pretend that somehow it is",64
NA,something new.,64
NA,"The new projects are being funded by cuts to existing road projects, like Melbourne's M80",64
NA,"and Tasmania's Midland Highway, as well as by the cancellation of urban rail investment",64
NA,including the Melbourne Metro and Brisbane's Cross River Rail Project. The Prime Minister,64
NA,scrapped these projects because he has an ideological aversion to public transport. He outlines,64
NA,that in his book Battlelines where he makes it clear that in his view there simply are not,64
NA,enough people who want to go from one destination to another to justify anything other than,64
NA,"the use of a car. The fact is, we cannot deal with urban congestion in our cities unless we have",64
NA,"both rail and road. That was recognised by Infrastructure Australia, which is why it",64
NA,recommended funding for both of those projects that were in place.,64
NA,The Prime Minister also said before the election that they would have cost-benefit analysis,64
NA,of all projects of $100 million or more. That promise seems to have gone the same way as:,64
NA,'No cuts to health or education or the ABC.' The fact is that in the budget that they put,64
NA,"forward, where they say there was a budget emergency, they have advanced $1.5 billion for",64
NA,"the East West project in Melbourne, this month, including $1 billion for stage 2 that is not due",64
NA,"to commence this financial year or next financial year but the financial year after that, if they",64
NA,ever work out where it is actually going to go. It is an extraordinary advance payment to the,64
NA,"Victorian government, which is of course facing an election.",64
NA,Their rhetoric regarding infrastructure is designed to distract Australians from the real heart,64
NA,"of the budget-the broken promises, the savage spending cuts and the unfairness. Here is this",64
NA,government's message to Australians: 'Never mind that you won't be able to see a doctor,64
NA,anymore. You'll be able to drive on a brand-new road that Labor funded three budgets ago.',64
NA,They made a statement of claim that within 12 months there would be cranes in the sky for,64
NA,"these projects that do not have planning, have not been through environmental assessment and",64
NA,do not have cost-benefit analysis.,64
NA,The problem for the government is that they spent so much time saying no to everything,64
NA,and being relentlessly negative that they did not craft alternative policies and did not craft an,64
NA,"alternative vision for the nation, which is why, when they came to government, we saw the",64
NA,budget-for the first time since 2008-not include a single new dollar for the Bruce Highway,64
NA,or the Pacific Highway over the forward estimates. There is not a single new dollar for rail,64
NA,"freight, yet the minister for infrastructure and his errand boy, the assistant minister, have been",64
NA,"busy re-announcing projects on these two highways and other projects, pretending that they",64
NA,"were not previously funded by the former, Labor government.",64
NA,The government has also ignored its own promises about the integrity of processes,64
NA,surrounding investment decisions. The government said before the election that it would work,64
NA,with Infrastructure Australia to ensure probity in selecting which infrastructure projects would,64
NA,"attract Commonwealth support, and yet we know that with the Perth Freight Link project",64
NA,"there is no plan, no design and no cost-benefit analysis at all. We know that because the WA",64
NA,NA,64
NA,state government says that is the case. We believe that the Infrastructure Australia model got,65
NA,"it right, but the government has introduced legislation, which it gagged in this place, to allow",65
NA,it to dictate IA's research agenda. The amendments would allow it to order IA to ignore,65
NA,"certain classes of infrastructure, such as public transport. The amendments would allow it to",65
NA,"gag Infrastructure Australia by preventing publication of its independent research. So, within",65
NA,"months of its election, the government is creeping away from its commitments to probity. In a",65
NA,"recent video, produced shamefully for political purposes to align with the D-Day",65
NA,"commemorations, the Prime Minister threw away all pretence. He complained about 'analysis",65
NA,"paralysis', which he said was preventing infrastructure projects from going ahead. What he",65
NA,was really saying was: 'Don't worry about proper analysis.' If the Prime Minister's word,65
NA,"means nothing to him, he can take that up with the electorate.",65
NA,"In the meantime, we are stuck with this bill. While process is an inconvenience to be",65
NA,"swatted away on that side of the House, the opposition will be moving amendments which",65
NA,will hold the government to its own claimed principles. The first would require that no project,65
NA,could be funded from this new fund unless it has been the subject of a full cost-benefit,65
NA,analysis ticked off by Infrastructure Australia and is in keeping with the government's own,65
NA,commitment that they would have proper analysis for any project in receipt of more than $100,65
NA,million.,65
NA,The second amendment relates directly to projects that are being funded by states via asset,65
NA,"sales, thereby earning the 15 per cent premium. It would require the finance minister to table a",65
NA,disallowable instrument for each privatisation transaction as a precondition to eligibility for it,65
NA,to attract an incentive payment. It is aimed at empowering this parliament to hold the,65
NA,"government to its own promises. Again, if the government is serious about funding genuine",65
NA,"productivity-enhancing projects properly assessed by independent experts, it should have no",65
NA,difficulty with this amendment.,65
NA,"Several projects funded in the budget, including the Perth Freight Link, Melbourne's East",65
NA,"West Link and Queensland's Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, are being funded even",65
NA,though Infrastructure Australia is yet to see full cost-benefit analysis. We are setting up a,65
NA,mechanism to make sure that the government's rhetoric is matched by the legislation. They,65
NA,need to be held to account so that we do not have absurdities like this $1½ billion advance,65
NA,payment to the Victorian government on behalf of taxpayers. What sort of budget slashes,65
NA,"health through the Medicare co-payment, education by abandoning the Gonski reforms, and",65
NA,public transport projects on the basis of 'These measures need to be made because there's a so-,65
NA,"called budget emergency,' but gives $1½ billion to sit in the Victorian government's bank",65
NA,account for no purpose other than making its budget look better prior to the election later this,65
NA,year? It stands in stark contrast to what the assistant minister said in a speech on 6 June. He,65
NA,said:,65
NA,… we are driving the state governments very hard to give us timetables to ensure that we're meeting the,65
NA,"expected time of delivery of these projects. That we're hitting milestones, that we're only making",65
NA,"payments to states when they actually deliver the milestones, that they're not getting money in their",65
NA,bank account prior to milestones being delivered …,65
NA,Not only are there no milestones for the East West project; they do not know where the tunnel,65
NA,"is going to emerge for stage 2. It is not even a line on a map, but they are giving them a billion",65
NA,dollars this year. That is why these amendments should be supported by the entire parliament.,65
NA,NA,65
NA,They are respectful of proper process; they are also a requirement when public money funds,66
NA,projects that will drive productivity gains.,66
NA,Labor's approach in government was to engage in real nation-building. It was to establish,66
NA,proper processes with Infrastructure Australia. We also got on with investment: we doubled,66
NA,the roads budget; we increased the rail budget by more than 10 times; and we rebuilt a third of,66
NA,"the national rail freight network, including cutting six hours from the trip from Melbourne to",66
NA,Brisbane and nine hours from the journey from the east to the west coast.,66
NA,I am very proud of the fact that we committed more money to urban public transport from,66
NA,2007 until 2013 than all previous Commonwealth governments combined from Federation to,66
NA,"2007. We planned and funded the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal, delivering major",66
NA,"productivity gains to Sydney and taking 3,300 trucks off the road every day-a project",66
NA,"expected to generate about $10 billion in economic benefits through increased productivity,",66
NA,"reduced freight costs, reduced traffic congestion and better environmental outcomes.",66
NA,The current government ran ads in the 2010 election campaign opposed to the Moorebank,66
NA,Intermodal Terminal. That is the opportunism we saw from those opposite. Compare that with,66
NA,the approach of the government-spurning the advice of Infrastructure Australia and,66
NA,"introducing legislation to undermine its independence, and failing to increase investment in",66
NA,"infrastructure spending, merely taking money away from projects that have been properly",66
NA,assessed and giving it to projects that are done on the back of an envelope. This bill avoids,66
NA,direct infrastructure investment while setting up the states and councils as the scapegoats of,66
NA,"the future, when people begin to see the results of its underinvestment. Unless Labor's",66
NA,"amendments to this bill are accepted, the government will have successfully created a vehicle",66
NA,for pork-barrelling and doing favours for its friends in coalition state governments.,66
NA,Given the record of infrastructure underspending and pork-barrelling of the previous,66
NA,"coalition government, surely this nation can do better than simply winding back the clock. By",66
NA,creating this incentive fund-taking money that had already been allocated for proper nation-,66
NA,"building investment, through the Building Australia Fund, and for proper investment in our",66
NA,"future, through education and science research and innovation, through the education",66
NA,investment fund-what the government is seeking to do is reduce its own involvement in the,66
NA,provision of infrastructure by paying the states and the private sector to do the heavy lifting.,66
NA,"There is, of course, a role for private sector investment. That is why we created the",66
NA,"infrastructure investment tax incentive, a scheme that would provide, through the",66
NA,"Infrastructure Australia process, an incentive in terms of changes to tax arrangements to",66
NA,encourage investment by the private sector-not just in greenfield infrastructure but also in,66
NA,brownfield assets. We introduced that in last year's budget. It came into effect at the end of,66
NA,"last year, but this government seems oblivious to it.",66
NA,We do not have a view on this side of the House that public sector is automatically bad and,66
NA,private sector is automatically good. That is the view of some of those opposite. They just,66
NA,want government to get out of the way in terms of government involvement in infrastructure.,66
NA,The consequences of that will be a reduction in investment and a scheme which will provide,66
NA,an incentive for state governments to privatise assets. Let me say this: if an asset is worthy of,66
NA,privatisation it needs to stand on its own merits. A top-up figure of 15 per cent over a period,66
NA,of just two years is a distortion of that process. If it is indeed in the longer-term interest of the,66
NA,NA,66
NA,"state which owns that asset-through the people, at the end of the day-then we should not be",67
NA,distorting that process.,67
NA,This nation needs Commonwealth leadership on infrastructure. It does not need a,67
NA,government that ignores the advice of independent experts and consults the electoral map to,67
NA,inform its investment decisions. The last thing it needs is a return to the blame game that,67
NA,"characterised the former government. Process is important, which is why we need to ensure",67
NA,that this legislation is amended to allow proper processes: proper assessments of projects plus,67
NA,accountability to this parliament by ensuring there is a disallowance instrument. I will be,67
NA,moving the amendments when it comes to consideration in detail and ask the House to,67
NA,support those amendments then. (Time expired),67
Mr IRONS ,Swan) (12:28): I rise to speak on the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the,67
NA,Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014. We have just heard from the,67
NA,"member for Grayndler, the former minister for infrastructure, who has made some interesting",67
NA,comments in his introductory speech.,67
NA,This government has made an unprecedented commitment to infrastructure and the,67
NA,legislation we are debating today forms a key part of that commitment. In just a few months,67
NA,"since being elected, the government has shown its intent and strategic approach to",67
NA,infrastructure across the country. With its decisions on massive visionary projects such as the,67
NA,"Western Sydney airport infrastructure package and the Perth Freight Link, which impacts my",67
NA,"electorate of Swan, this is already in stark contrast to the previous minister's approach of",67
NA,untargeted and unfunded spending with no strategic plan or direction.,67
NA,"In fact, I would suggest that nowhere in Australia is this government's commitment to",67
NA,infrastructure more apparent than in my electorate of Swan currently. But this bill takes the,67
NA,government's approach to a new level. It provides for future infrastructure through a recycling,67
NA,program involving federal financial incentives for the sale of mature assets by the state,67
NA,governments where the proceeds are directed into new infrastructure. This will potentially see,67
NA,a generation of new infrastructure projects across the country. It has the backing of the,67
NA,"states-including, it seems, Labor controlled South Australia-as the premiers can see the",67
NA,"advantages of the bill. Yesterday we saw proposals by the New South Wales government and,",67
NA,"in May, Treasurer Nahan of Western Australia referred to a likely asset sale process in the",67
NA,"state budget. So there is plenty of support from all sides, except, it seems, the other side.",67
NA,It seems from the former minister's speech that the Labor Party in this place is not fully,67
NA,"behind this legislation and the previous speaker, the member for Grayndler, has indicated they",67
NA,"will be moving some amendments. We will not be supporting those amendments, which",67
NA,attempt to put a roadblock on this legislation. We know Labor's commitment to infrastructure,67
NA,"is untargeted and chaotic. We know that the member for Perth, who is in the chamber at the",67
NA,"moment, is the chief opponent of the Perth Freight Link project which will link the Kewdale-",67
NA,Welshpool industrial area with the ports. We know that the member for Grayndler made,67
NA,Gateway WA conditional on mining tax revenue which did not exist. We know that the record,67
NA,of the previous government on delivering broadband infrastructure in WA was the worst in,67
NA,the country. We also know that there was no interest or intention of funding the Manning on-,67
NA,ramp in my electorate of Swan.,67
NA,Labor's position on this legislation would make new projects more difficult and it would,67
NA,"hold back new infrastructure projects in Australia. The previous speaker, the member for",67
NA,NA,67
NA,"Grayndler, also talked about cost-cutting analysis and processes and cost-benefit analysis. It",68
NA,just amazes me when you look at what they did with the NBN and the process they went,68
NA,through there on the back of a drinks coaster. He said there might be a panic sale of assets.,68
NA,But when Labor came in and they wanted to start some of what they called their infrastructure,68
NA,"spending and kick things along, they looked at any project that they said was shovel ready.",68
NA,There was no cost-benefit analysis. They just went straight into that. The pink batts is another,68
NA,"prime situation, with the royal commission currently looking at that. So how they can sit there",68
NA,and talk about the processes of how things should be done after their previous record of six,68
NA,years just amazes me.,68
NA,The coalition have increased the infrastructure spending by 55 per cent over the period to,68
NA,"2018-19 compared to under Labor, whereas the previous speaker said we had not. Labor had",68
NA,no great record on public transport. The former minister did not realise that 50 per cent of,68
NA,public transport in Australia is by bus on roads. Seventy per cent of all domestic passenger,68
NA,"movements within Australia-by car or bus-occur on roads, whereas he was slating the",68
NA,current Prime Minister as not being interested in any rail infrastructure. The shadow minister,68
NA,says asset recycling will discourage investment in public transport. But as today's minister,68
NA,"pointed out just the other day, the Commonwealth is doing a lot of heavy lifting in road",68
NA,"funding, allowing states to bring forward other public transport projects. In fact, since the",68
NA,"coalition was elected, the states have committed $25 billion to major public transport projects.",68
NA,This bill establishes an Asset Recycling Fund of $5.9 billion initially. The Asset Recycling,68
NA,"Fund, as outlined in this year's budget, is being established to provide incentives to states and",68
NA,territories to invest in new infrastructure projects that boost economic growth. The $5.9,68
NA,billion is sourced from uncommitted money in the Building Australia Fund and the Education,68
NA,"Investment Fund. I note the government is committed to adding to the ARF over time,",68
NA,including through the proceeds of the sale of Medibank Private and with proceeds from any,68
NA,"further privatisation initiatives. The ARF will support the Asset Recycling Initiative, which",68
NA,encourages the sale of brownfield assets such as ports or electricity companies with proven,68
NA,"earnings to private sector investors, freeing up more funds for infrastructure projects. To",68
NA,"encourage funds to be spent on infrastructure projects, the Commonwealth government will",68
NA,provide payments of 15 per cent of the sale price of privatised assets to state and territory,68
NA,"governments, on the condition that the proceeds of the sales are reinvested in productivity-",68
NA,enhancing assets. The sale of ports in New South Wales and Queensland Motorways,68
NA,highlights the interest of the private sector to invest in brownfield assets.,68
NA,"The consequential amendments will apply to the COAG Reform Fund Act 2008, the Future",68
NA,"Fund Act 2006, the Nation-building Funds Act 2008 and the DisabilityCare Australia Fund",68
NA,Act 2013. These amendments will allow for the fund to be managed by the Future Fund,68
NA,"Board of Guardians, who have an exemplary record of managing investment portfolios for the",68
NA,"government, and for the funds to be distributed through the COAG Reform Fund.",68
NA,Delivering modern infrastructure is a key part of the government's Economic Action,68
NA,"Strategy to boost economic growth, increase productivity and create thousands of new jobs.",68
NA,"Overall, the 2013-14 budget unveiled the biggest ever spend for infrastructure in our nation's",68
NA,history: $50 billion. Our plan will leverage greater co-contributions from the state,68
NA,"governments as well as, for the first time in WA, co-contributions from the private sector.",68
NA,Encouraging investment from the private sector is the best way to ensure that taxpayers get,68
NA,NA,68
NA,the most infrastructure advancements that their money can provide. By changing the way that,69
NA,infrastructure projects are financed through partnering with state and territory governments,69
NA,"and leveraging private sector investment, Australia is set to receive $126 billion worth of",69
NA,investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure over the next 10 years. This new,69
NA,infrastructure will help relieve congestion which is believed to be costing our economy $15,69
NA,billion a year. It will create jobs and tackle pollution. Investing in infrastructure is an,69
NA,investment in the future.,69
NA,Initiatives such as the ARF are of particular importance in my state of Western,69
NA,"Australia,where the transition of the mining boom from production phase to development",69
NA,stage creates unique challenges. A key aspect of the coalition's budget is to roll out an,69
NA,infrastructure plan that adequately deals with this change and that creates jobs for the,69
NA,"thousands of construction workers, as well as the many engineers, designers and professionals",69
NA,who play an important role in the delivery of major projects. It would be irresponsible not to,69
NA,aid the creation of jobs that ensure these highly skilled and experienced people remain in,69
NA,"Australia, contributing to our economy.",69
NA,"With this in mind, the Western Australian Treasurer, Mike Nahan, spoke of his",69
NA,government's plans for an 'orderly program of assets sales' in the 8 May state budget. He,69
NA,outlined the state government's plans to consider the sale of a number of brownfield assets,69
NA,including the Kwinana bulk terminal and the Utah Point facility at Port Hedland. The,69
NA,Treasurer went on to note:,69
NA,"The Government's continuing ownership of the Perth Market Authority, the TAB and the Water",69
NA,"Corporation's assets, such as its wastewater treatment plants, will also be reviewed.",69
NA,Revenue derived from the sale of these assets will be directed to two areas: the reductions of,69
NA,the state's debt levels and to contribute to the cost of new infrastructure.,69
NA,The Commonwealth and WA state government have a track record of working together to,69
NA,deliver much-needed infrastructure to the people of Western Australia. In the 2013-14 budget,69
NA,the government continued this tradition by making a record $4.7 billion commitment to,69
NA,"funding infrastructure in WA. As I said before, some of the best examples of this co-operation",69
NA,"lay within my electorate of Swan. Projects such as the Perth Freight Link and Gateway WA,",69
NA,"both funded by the state and Commonwealth governments, will allow growing cities like",69
NA,Perth to move into the future comfortable in the knowledge that they have the capacity to,69
NA,support a growing population and continued high exports on their roads.,69
NA,Unlike those opposite we have committed to funding these projects without a mining tax.,69
NA,The Labor Party somehow thought they were funding these projects from a tax that did not,69
NA,"raise any money. I know the member for Perth is in the chamber, and she has stated before",69
NA,that she does not support the mining tax and recognises that it disproportionately affects the,69
NA,people of WA. It is a pity that her colleagues do not agree with her.,69
NA,"The Perth Freight Link carries a price tag of $1.6 billion, of which the Commonwealth will",69
NA,"fund $925 million, the state government will cover the remaining 20 per cent of government",69
NA,contributions and the private sector will fund the remaining amount-approximately $400,69
NA,million. Despite economic research which shows that for every $1 invested in the Perth,69
NA,"Freight Link it will return $5 in economic benefits, this project would never have been funded",69
NA,"by a Labor government. Even now, after years of research showing that this project will",69
NA,"increase productivity, create jobs and improve the road network, it is still not supported by",69
NA,NA,69
NA,"those opposite. In fact I see the member for Perth in the chamber, and she recently called this",70
NA,proposal 'a scandalous squandering of taxpayers' funds.' I would like to remind the member,70
NA,that the debt and deficit levels in this country have reached a point where the government is,70
NA,now paying over $1 billion dollars per month in interest. The interest bill paid by the,70
NA,government between 2010-11 and 2013-14 on gross debt is over $46 billion dollars. The,70
NA,government could have funded almost the entirety of its infrastructure package with what is,70
NA,"wasted on interest payments. That is, in my opinion, a real squandering of taxpayers' funds.",70
NA,Despite ongoing protest from those opposite I am pleased to note that it's not only the WA,70
NA,state government who recognise the opportunity that ARF grants give them to invest in long-,70
NA,"term productivity-enhancing projects. Just today the New South Wales Treasurer, Andrew",70
NA,"Constance, announced in the New South Wales budget that a long-term lease of 49 per cent of",70
NA,the state's electricity network assets will assist with funding a comprehensive package of new,70
NA,"infrastructure programs. This package includes $400 million for the Parramatta light rail, $5.2",70
NA,billion for the North West Rail Link and an extra $100 million for the Hunter Infrastructure,70
NA,"Fund, to name a few. The budget includes significant investment in road, rail and public",70
NA,"transport, further disproving the claims from those opposite that the coalition's plans will",70
NA,discourage investment in rail or public transport.,70
NA,"The coalition promised to build the roads of the 21st century, and it is legislation such as",70
NA,this which will see us do just that for the benefit of our economy and our nation. As the,70
NA,"assistant minister pointed out on 6 June, our infrastructure plan is not a GFC-style pink batts",70
NA,program or a school halls program but a well planned program about building productive,70
NA,infrastructure. Increased funding and the encouragement of investment in infrastructure will,70
NA,"provide benefits in both the short and long term by creating jobs, easing congestion and",70
NA,ensuring prosperity for generations to come.,70
NA,I know I have spoken in this place about Infrastructure in my electorate before. One in,70
NA,"particular is the Manning Road on-ramp and Canning Bridge vision, about which I had a",70
NA,"meeting with the Minister for Transport, Dean Nalder, last week. We discussed that and",70
NA,talked about opportunities that might arise from this particular infrastructure fund for things,70
NA,"like a Manning Road on-ramp, which I know the member for Perth was supportive of many",70
NA,"years ago. I congratulate her for that interest she took in that particular area, because it now is",70
NA,becoming a safety issue for many people in that part of the electorate.,70
NA,I see that the member for Perth is going to speak next. Maybe she might like to tell us some,70
NA,"of the reasons she is so focused on delivering infrastructure nobody wants, particularly the",70
NA,South Perth train station. That was built into the forward estimates in her time. As someone,70
NA,"who lives in South Perth and for many of the other residents there, it is something that is not",70
NA,required and something that is not wanted. Something like the Manning Road on-ramp is,70
NA,what most of the people in my electorate of Swan would look forward to. If the opportunity,70
NA,"arises, it would be great if we saw that come to fruition in the near future.",70
NA,We heard from the previous speaker as well how supportive they are of infrastructure,70
NA,funding. I remember quoting from an executive from Perth Airport who initially spoke to the,70
NA,"minister for infrastructure in the previous government when he was looking for funding for, at",70
NA,"first, the Gateway project. The response from the minister at that particular time was not",70
NA,"supportive; it was saying, 'So you guys want another handout.' That type of attitude from",70
NA,those opposite is the reason why they need to support this bill and get on with the job.,70
NA,NA,70
NA,I commend this bill to the House.,71
Ms MACTIERNAN ,"Perth) (12:43): So many fallacies, so many fantasies and only 15",71
NA,minutes in which to address them all. I want to start by strongly supporting the contribution,71
NA,"by the member for Grayndler. He gave, I think, a very cogent analysis-",71
Mr Snowdon, Erudite.,71
Ms MACTIERNAN, erudite and cogent analysis of how this legislation is in fact going to,71
NA,encourage suboptimal decisions on dealing with assets. I will get onto the specific questions,71
NA,"of the member for Swan in a few minutes, but I just want to make this general statement that",71
NA,it is very easy for politicians. They want to sound like they are being financially sound and,71
NA,financially prudent and they talk about privatising assets and using those assets to reinvest,71
NA,"without any real detailed analysis of where, in fact, that is going to take us financially,",71
NA,"whether or not that stacks up when we analyse this. The member for Swan is running away,",71
NA,because he knows I am just going to tell him about all his errors on Roe Highway stage 8.,71
NA,Mr Irons interjecting-,71
Ms MACTIERNAN, It is true. I take great pride in the fact that after decades of stalling on,71
NA,"Roe Highway I was minister when we completed Roe Highway stage 4, Roe Highway stage",71
NA,"5, Roe Highway stage 6 and Roe Highway stage 7. But we were not prepared to commit to",71
NA,"Roe Highway stage 8, because it simply did not make sense. It did not make sense when we",71
NA,saw the trajectory of the Fremantle Port development moving to the outer harbour and given,71
NA,our understanding that the basin of the port was going to be at its final stage some time,71
NA,between 2017 and 2020 and that a new container facility south of Roe Highway would need,71
NA,"to be built. So, quite frankly, not only is developing Roe Highway Stage 8 a problematic",71
NA,"process environmentally, but economically it does not make sense. It does not make sense to",71
NA,spend $850 million on five kilometres of road going to a port that is actually going to be,71
NA,moving south within a year after the opening of that road.,71
NA,"Putting that to one side, I want to talk about this issue of asset reinvestment and how easy it",71
NA,is to adopt a mantra that makes it sound like you are being commercially sensible and,71
NA,"commercially sound when in fact you are being the exact opposite. Now, there are cases",71
NA,where it does make sense to sell assets. Very often government will acquire assets and engage,71
NA,in development simply because the market is not strong enough. In the early stages of a,71
NA,"development, government may need to invest in something that subsequently, when the",71
NA,"population grows and matures, is a function that can be quite properly supported by the",71
NA,"private sector. But making decisions in this area requires very, very detailed analysis. It",71
NA,depends on where the numbers fall and what the risks are in each individual case. First of all,71
NA,"we have to look at the actual price received. When you sell something off, it is not money for",71
NA,jam. You are actually selling an asset. And quite often we see cash based reports in the budget,71
NA,that will show the sale of an asset as improving performance. We have all of this additional,71
NA,"revenue that has come in because we have sold the asset, even though we may have sold that",71
NA,asset at a very poor price. Even when we are doing accounting on an accrual basis we might,71
NA,"see a positive result where we get more than book value for an asset, even though that is in",71
NA,fact far less than its actual value. And hopefully I will have some time to tell the story of the,71
NA,great failed privatisation of the Perth freight network.,71
NA,NA,71
NA,We also have to look properly at the revenues lost and make a rational assessment as to,72
NA,"whether it is cheaper to borrow than to lose the income stream concerned. Interestingly, the",72
NA,member for Swan was going on about the level of debt and using the raw numbers of debt.,72
NA,That really has become a disingenuous obsession of the government. But we know that in,72
NA,"making an intelligent assessment of where an economy is, where a government is, we look at",72
NA,net debt-to-revenue ratios. You do not just look at debt; you look at debt to revenue. Of,72
NA,"course, if you are selling off your revenue-generating assets you might be reducing your net",72
NA,debt but you are also reducing your revenue. So you do need to make a careful calculation,72
NA,about whether or not the revenue you lose is actually going to be properly compensated for.,72
NA,The Western Australian government is now talking about selling the Utah Point Berth in the,72
NA,Port Hedland port. The rate of return on capital across the Port Hedland port is about 14.2 per,72
NA,"cent. We do not have access to the more detailed information, but if we put the evidence",72
NA,together the rate of return on revenue in Utah Point would be much higher than that. That is,72
NA,the facility that is really bringing home the bacon for the Port Hedland Port Authority. But,72
NA,"even if you accept it at 14.2 per cent, compare that to the current state bond rates, which vary",72
NA,from about 3.75 per cent to eight per cent. We could actually borrow a lot less than the,72
NA,"sacrifice of that income that we are getting from Utah Point. So, we are getting a much higher",72
NA,"rate of return than we are paying in interest. If you are being sensible, if you are being really",72
NA,"prudent, you will say to yourself, 'Does it really make sense for us to sell this?'",72
NA,"For those reasons, we are deeply concerned that these privatisations be subject to a proper",72
NA,cost-benefit analysis so that for each one of those we do a detailed and proper analysis of just,72
NA,what that return will be and how it is going to impact on the net debt-to-revenue ratio rather,72
NA,than the financially simplistic and irresponsible approach of just focusing on the debt level.,72
NA,We are also particularly concerned that the 15 per cent bonus in itself-the supplement that is,72
NA,"on offer by the federal government, and which does not enhance the amount of money",72
NA,"available for infrastructure, because that could easily be given by way of a grant-has the",72
NA,potential to be a great distortion in itself. And it has the potential in part to become a subsidy,72
NA,to the private sector as state governments are prepared to discount the price in order to attract,72
NA,the supplement. We stress that the amendments we are putting up are very much designed to,72
NA,ensure that we have a much more economically rational discussion about the assets that are,72
NA,"being proposed for sale, and whether or not that is in fact in the best interests of the taxpayers.",72
NA,But I think it is also important to understand that the potential risks of privatisation go well,72
NA,beyond the problem of ensuring that we get a good return on assets and that we do not,72
NA,unnecessarily sacrifice highly profitable revenue streams for a short-term boost in debt levels,72
NA,"to enable brand-new projects to be announced. I want to talk about a couple of facilities, one",72
NA,"of which is the Utah Bulk Loading Facility, which I referred to a bit earlier. This facility was",72
NA,built by the government in the Port Hedland port with the aim of providing a facility for the,72
NA,"junior miners. For those who are less familiar with Port Hedland, it is a port that",72
NA,"understandably has traditionally been dominated by BHP. Like many ports in WA, there has",72
NA,"been a bit of an unfortunate history in terms of access by third parties to this infrastructure,",72
NA,even though the infrastructure might notionally be controlled by government. When FMG,72
NA,"was attempting to become a player in the iron ore industry, BHP very much played hardball to",72
NA,"keep FMG out. With the strategic intervention of the then government, FMG got its place in",72
NA,"the sun, but, alas, FMG did much the same thing to the entrants attempting to come in behind",72
NA,NA,72
NA,it. The development of a facility like the Utah bulk-loading facility was in part a way of,73
NA,dealing with that.,73
NA,"My concern is that this facility, even if it is sold for a good price and we get a good return",73
NA,"on it, could fall into the hands of someone who was in fact ultimately a player and who had a",73
NA,"strategic interest in keeping third parties out, and we have certainly seen this happen in the",73
NA,grain freight industry. Whilst that might be to the economic benefit of that company it is not,73
NA,"going to be of economic benefit to the region, to Western Australia and to Australia. It is very",73
NA,"important to understand this, particularly in relation to ports. The ports on the west coast,",73
NA,"where we have very difficult marine conditions, are located where they are because they are",73
NA,the optimal places to site safe berthage. It is not like building a supermarket. If you want to,73
NA,compete you cannot just open one down the road. It is very difficult and complex to find a site,73
NA,where it is cost-effective to build such a facility. We really need to understand the long-term,73
NA,implications for regional development from these privatisations.,73
NA,I note that the member for Swan talked about the state treasurer's proposal to sell Kwinana,73
NA,Bulk Terminal. This is pretty incredible given Mr Barnett's comment just before the last,73
NA,"election that the one thing he would not be privatising is the Fremantle ports, and of course",73
NA,the Kwinana outer harbour is one of the Fremantle ports.,73
NA,I want to talk briefly about a classic failed privatisation and how the need to be seen to,73
NA,"bring down the debt levels, but clearly not looking holistically at the budget, can be a",73
NA,complete disaster. We had a situation in the late 1990s where another wheat farmer who had,73
NA,control of the transport portfolio spent a motza on roads leading everywhere. The budget was,73
NA,in great crisis and he came up with this great proposal to sell off the freight rail network. They,73
NA,said they would sell off the grain freight network and make heaps of money so that they could,73
NA,"continue building more roads. We warned at the time that this would lead to cherry picking,",73
NA,"with a great deal of focus by the private provider on the tier one lines, those lines on which",73
NA,"there was a great deal of freight, whereas the smaller lines would basically be left to rot and",73
NA,"not properly maintained, and ultimately the operator would walk away from those lines. We",73
NA,"were assured that that would never happen, but we did not believe it. Ultimately, everything",73
NA,we predicted has in fact happened. The amount of money we got for the sale of this asset did,73
NA,not even cover the book value. So there was in fact no actual net benefit at all asset-wise to,73
NA,"the state. But we had a situation that has required subsequent governments, federal and state,",73
NA,to invest $360 million of taxpayers' money in an attempt to keep the freight network going,73
NA,"and, in particular, to keep the tier three lines going. Much to the chagrin of the farmers we see",73
NA,that freight coming off the rail and onto the roads is creating mega road hazards and making,73
NA,"many country towns and outer metropolitan roads very unsafe, requiring vast sums of money",73
NA,be spent. So it was a massive result of cost-shifting. It was a short-term political fix that over,73
NA,a decade later the people of Western Australia are still picking up the tab for. I urge the,73
NA,government to support these amendments. They are absolutely critical to getting a proper,73
NA,economic understanding of where we are going with privatisation.,73
Mr TAYLOR ,"Hume) (12:59): Being from a rural electorate and from a rural upbringing,",73
NA,"off-road is a term I use often. Like many popular words, its meaning has been distorted over",73
NA,time. It is no longer just a descriptor for being away from the main road. Its new meaning is,73
NA,"more along the lines of rough and rugged, pumped up with adrenaline, hooliganish and out of",73
NA,control. So off-road is a term I would like to use to describe the former Labor government. I,73
NA,NA,73
NA,would comfortably use that term in that context. Not only did they go off-roading at the wheel,74
NA,"of the Australian economy for six long years, they blew the tyres, cooked the radiator, stalled",74
NA,in top gear and ended up floating down the proverbial stream.,74
NA,"Despite the glossy ads, we all know about the damage bill when you go off-road. The",74
NA,challenge before us is to get our economy back onto the straight and narrow. While the way,74
NA,"forward is achievable, there is a major shift needed. The coalition budget before the House is",74
NA,a contribute-and-build budget. Today I want to talk about the build. The government is,74
NA,establishing an asset recycling fund to build the finances to support historically high,74
NA,"infrastructure investment for Australia. Under this legislation, financial incentives will be",74
NA,provided to the states and territories to sell existing assets and reinvest the proceeds into,74
NA,productive economic infrastructure and into providing the additional investment dollars to,74
NA,fast-track nationally significant projects.,74
NA,"At this time in our history, there is no question that infrastructure is absolutely critical. The",74
NA,infrastructure backlog in Australia has been variously estimated at somewhere between $455,74
NA,"billion and $770 billion. These are numbers big enough, almost, to rival Labor's debt burden.",74
NA,A 2012 Infrastructure Australia report to COAG identified over $70 billion worth of priority,74
NA,infrastructure projects that we should be moving on immediately. They also identified that we,74
NA,are falling behind on maintaining our existing road and rail.,74
NA,"As I said in the House quite recently, there are two very good reasons why we need high-",74
NA,"quality infrastructure and significant infrastructure investment. First, we are facing a dramatic",74
NA,"slowdown in mining investment in this country. We are seeing mining investment, which had",74
NA,"risen from something like $30 billion up to $120 billion, falling away dramatically because of",74
NA,the policies of the previous Labor government. We have frugal consumers and we have a high,74
NA,"dollar. Without infrastructure investment, we will not, in coming years, see the sort of growth",74
NA,and prosperity we need. The second reason is that we face a productivity crisis. Productivity,74
NA,growth has slowed dramatically in recent years. We know that capital productivity is the heart,74
NA,of the problem. We are not making enough investments and we are not making investments in,74
NA,the right capital projects.,74
NA,So Australia faces a significant challenge over the coming years. Whilst our exports are,74
NA,"growing strongly and are set to continue to grow strongly, we will need to lift our rate of",74
NA,productivity growth if we are to continue to enjoy the types of increases in our standard of,74
NA,"living that we have grown used to. In a speech in November 2013, the Deputy Governor of",74
NA,"the RBA, Philip Lowe, emphasised the potential for infrastructure investment to address",74
NA,Australia's declining productivity growth. He said:,74
NA,"… the Australian economy faces a substantial challenge. Over the next decade or so, if we are to",74
NA,"achieve anything like the type of growth in real per capita income that we have become used to, then a",74
NA,substantial increase in productivity growth will be required. We can no longer depend on a rising terms,74
NA,of trade and favourable demographics to make us richer. If this lift in productivity growth does not take,74
NA,"place, then we will need to adjust to some combination of slower growth in real wages, slower growth",74
NA,"in profits, smaller gains in asset prices and slower growth in government revenues and services – in",74
NA,"short, slower growth in our average living standard. So the debate about productivity should not be seen",74
NA,as an esoteric one just for economists. Productivity growth matters and it matters a lot to our future,74
NA,living standards.,74
NA,NA,74
NA,Mr Lowe went on to say:,75
NA,"In the years ahead, it is unlikely that Australia's comparative advantage will lie in the production of",75
NA,"standardised mass-produced manufactured goods for the global market. Instead, we have tremendous",75
NA,"opportunities in a range of more specialised high value-added goods and services, where it is the quality",75
NA,of our ideas and the quality of our execution that is the key. Whether or not we can seize these,75
NA,opportunities depends critically on our human capital and our infrastructure.,75
NA,"Later in his speech, he said:",75
NA,The benefits of investment in transportation infrastructure are well known. Some of these are quite,75
NA,"obvious, while others are more difficult to see, although no less important. Among the more obvious",75
NA,benefits is a reduction in travel times and costs for both people and goods. There can also be favourable,75
NA,social impacts through reducing travel stress and increasing the connectedness of communities. And,75
NA,there are environmental benefits as well.,75
NA,"Unfortunately, Labor did little to address these issues.",75
NA,We know that good infrastructure investment needs to be depoliticised and we know it,75
NA,needs to focus on costs and benefits. That is something that the Labor government failed,75
NA,dismally to achieve. We have heard in this House that only 14 per cent of Labor's stimulus,75
NA,"expenditure was spent on productive infrastructure. We saw that, of the $80 billion of",75
NA,"stimulus expenditure, none of it-not one dollar of it-went to Infrastructure Australia for",75
NA,"approval. We need transparency, rigour and independence in our infrastructure investment.",75
NA,"The Productivity Commission's 2014 report, Public infrastructure, stated:",75
NA,There are numerous examples of inferior project selection and inadequate assessment of the costs and,75
NA,"benefits of public infrastructure projects … In particular, government decisions can become politicised",75
NA,and may be based on inadequate information and assessment of the costs and benefits of projects …,75
NA,"Inferior investment decisions are not unique to governments … However, when the government makes",75
NA,"mistakes regarding large public infrastructure projects, the consequences are felt more broadly by the",75
NA,"community and taxpayers, often for long periods of time.",75
NA,"In March last year, Fairfax business journalist Adele Ferguson authored an editorial in The",75
NA,Sydney Morning Herald in which she discussed Infrastructure Australia. She said that the,75
NA,ALP government had created Infrastructure Australia to 'eliminate pork barrelling by creating,75
NA,a priority list of infrastructure projects based on a cost-benefit analysis and advising on major,75
NA,"policy reforms'. However, we know that Infrastructure Australia was effectively marginalised",75
NA,"by the Labor-Green government, as most famously evidenced by Labor's pre-election",75
NA,approval of the Parramatta to Epping Rail Link project-which did not feature on IA's list of,75
NA,priority tasks.,75
NA,"In an article in The Australian in February this year, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss",75
NA,wrote:,75
NA,"WHEN Anthony Albanese set up Infrastructure Australia in 2008 he made it his personal lapdog,",75
NA,largely answerable to him.,75
NA,"IA was sidelined on any real decision-making, forced to play catch-up and chase its tail to justify",75
NA,projects Labor had already announced without consulting its expert advisory body.,75
NA,"Labor's road and rail funding projects, its big-spending response to the global financial crisis, its",75
NA,"infrastructure election promises, were all announced without being fully assessed by IA.",75
NA,"We need look no further than the NBN for a clear example of poor infrastructure investment,",75
NA,with a significant impact on the government balance sheet. There was no cost-benefit analysis,75
NA,NA,75
NA,"and we saw extreme politicisation of investment in infrastructure. Indeed, we know that the",76
NA,decision was made on the back of a serviette.,76
NA,"In the absence of an intervention from this government, state under-investment in",76
NA,"infrastructure is inevitable. As the Productivity Commission report I referred to earlier notes,",76
NA,"the Commonwealth has a comparatively wider and more efficient tax base, despite heavier",76
NA,levels of investment from the states and territories. This has already led to large transfers from,76
NA,"the Commonwealth to the lower levels of government, for the purpose of financing",76
NA,"infrastructure. As an October 2013 report from Moody's demonstrates, state and territory debt",76
NA,levels have ballooned since 2008 and are projected to increase into the foreseeable future.,76
NA,This will further limit the funding that state governments can provide for infrastructure.,76
NA,"It is clear that the experts endorse our infrastructure focused budget. On budget night,",76
NA,Infrastructure Partnerships Australia said:,76
NA,"This is a very strong budget, because it makes difficult revenue and expenditure decisions, allowing",76
NA,Canberra to fund an unprecedented $50 billion investment in economic infrastructure.,76
NA,Chief Executive Brendan Lyon also commented that over the forward estimates the Abbott,76
NA,government's total infrastructure investment represents around a $9 billion increase compared,76
NA,to the last five years. He noted:,76
NA,"The states will always have a central role in funding and providing public infrastructure, but with high",76
NA,"levels of debt and substantial operating deficits, a higher and sustained level of national investment",76
NA,alongside the states is warranted.,76
NA,So it is clear what the experts say. It is clear that they are on our side.,76
NA,We recognise that there are still challenges ahead. Philip Lowe rightly points out that a key,76
NA,challenge is to ensure there are strong systems of governance in place so that money is spent,76
NA,wisely. That is why we restructured Infrastructure Australia. The second key challenge is the,76
NA,ongoing funding of projects beyond the large expenditure we committed to in the budget. It is,76
NA,no use identifying infrastructure projects with large potential gains if a way cannot be found,76
NA,to finance them.,76
NA,The financing challenge arises not because of a lack of money available to invest in,76
NA,infrastructure. Many private-sector investors tell us-tell me-that there is plenty of money,76
NA,sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested in infrastructure assets. The issue is more a,76
NA,reluctance of investors to take on the construction and patronage risks and/or the difficulties,76
NA,of charging for the use of infrastructure.,76
NA,"Looking forward, we need to find a sustainable way in which to finance our infrastructure",76
NA,needs over the long term. Regardless of whether it is the private or public sector doing the,76
NA,"financing, it is likely to be easier if we consider different options for pricing and funding",76
NA,"transport infrastructure. User-pay models have emerged for all other utilities-water,",76
NA,electricity and telecommunications. We need to seriously consider broader user-pay models,76
NA,"for all roads, with hypothecation of revenues not just for roads in general but also, perhaps,",76
NA,"for the owner of the specific road. The technology is now available, and the benefits are clear.",76
NA,Not only will this increase investment in high-growth and congested roads but also it will,76
NA,"better regulate road use, encouraging commuters to find alternatives when there is significant",76
NA,congestion.,76
NA,NA,76
NA,"In a report for Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, Deloitte has shown how this can work",77
NA,"and, most importantly, how it will help regional areas, despite claims by some to the contrary.",77
NA,"As a society, we have a lot riding on finding a way to pay for the infrastructure we need to",77
NA,boost our productivity and improve our living standards.,77
NA,"Those of us who come from regional communities know that connectivity is king, and",77
NA,good connectivity comes from good communications infrastructure and good transport,77
NA,infrastructure. In my electorate of Hume we saw a complete failure of investment during,77
NA,those Labor years. The NBN failure is well known. It has been talked about at length in this,77
NA,House. We have also seen transport infrastructure-investment failure. The Hume Highway is,77
NA,now basically a conveyor belt of trucks in the evenings. We see the B-doubles going from,77
NA,"Melbourne to Sydney and back, because rail has failed.",77
NA,"For many years, since about 2007, in fact, we have seen the Labor government fail to",77
NA,sufficiently invest in rail infrastructure on that corridor. We as a government have said we,77
NA,want to address that. We want to address that with our $300 million investment in the,77
NA,Melbourne-Brisbane rail link and with further investment on the coastal corridor. That will,77
NA,"take trucks off the road, it will support a better drive-a safer drive-and will mean fewer",77
NA,trucks on the Hume Highway. It will have the benefit of creating regional freight hubs,77
NA,throughout my electorate.,77
NA,"For the grain growers in the wheat belt of NSW, this will give many options they do not",77
NA,"have today. They will be able to send their wheat to Newcastle, Port Kembla, Brisbane or",77
NA,Melbourne. The Barton Highway is also a failure of the previous Labor government. We are,77
NA,"upping investment in the highway, including development of a staged duplication plan.",77
NA,"Finally, our significant investments in black-spot and Roads to Recovery programs are",77
NA,important responses to a dire infrastructure backlog.,77
NA,The Australian public deserve better. We are no longer crammed into the back seat of some,77
NA,kind of juvenile joy ride like we were under the Labor government. The grown-ups are back,77
NA,"at the wheel. We know that good infrastructure investment needs to be de-politicised, and we",77
NA,know it also needs to focus on costs and benefits. This is something the Labor government,77
NA,failed to do. Through an Asset Recycling Fund we will build the finances to support this,77
NA,government's record package of infrastructure investment. Five billion dollars has been,77
NA,"committed to provide financial incentives over five years to the states and territories, to sell",77
NA,assets and reinvest those proceeds. This will leverage a significant increase in private sector,77
NA,investment and create massive new opportunities for investors. I fully commend this bill to,77
NA,the House.,77
Mr GILES ,Scullin) (13:14): In rising to make a contribution to debate on the Asset,77
NA,Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill,77
NA,"2014, I will start by reflecting on two aspects of the contribution of the previous speaker, the",77
NA,"member for Hume. He referred to the position of the experts, in terms of this government's",77
NA,"approach to infrastructure provisions, as being 'clear'. I agree with him in so far as that, but",77
NA,the conclusion he seeks to draw is simply not tenable. What the experts want out of a,77
NA,Commonwealth government's approach to infrastructure provision is transparency and,77
NA,adherence to a strong evidence base which meets the productivity challenge of Australia. That,77
NA,"is little in evidence under this government, as I and other Labor speakers have said on many",77
NA,occasions since the election when we have debated infrastructure in this chamber.,77
NA,NA,77
NA,"I also note that the member for Hume did effectively set out, I believe, the scale of the",78
NA,infrastructure backlog we confront in Australia today and its relationship to the productivity,78
NA,crisis and challenge we must confront head-on if we are to preserve our standard of living.,78
NA,"Insofar as he made those remarks in setting out the challenge, I am entirely in agreement with",78
NA,"the member for Hume. But, in agreeing with him in that regard, I see a very different path",78
NA,forward for the role of the Commonwealth with respect to infrastructure.,78
NA,I have spoken regularly in this place about Commonwealth spending in infrastructure. This,78
NA,"is partly because I represent an outer suburban electorate, an electorate that requires",78
NA,considerable investment in infrastructure across all asset classes. I am very pleased to say that,78
NA,under Labor it received its fair share. I have also spoken about Commonwealth spending in,78
NA,"infrastructure because I believe the Commonwealth government has a vital role, a key role, in",78
NA,investing in the infrastructure of our cities-a role this government appears to be in denial,78
NA,"about, even though it goes to the very heart of the productivity challenge that we face, as well",78
NA,"as to pressing concerns about liveability, sustainability and of course equity.",78
NA,"More generally, I am concerned to see Australia, through the Commonwealth, secure our",78
NA,"infrastructure future in real rather than rhetorical terms, and delivering, not passing the buck",78
NA,to other tiers of government. In addressing these bills-I should make clear that I am also in,78
NA,support of both amendments foreshadowed by the member for Grayndler-I believe it is,78
NA,important to place them in their proper context: how our self-described infrastructure Prime,78
NA,Minister is going about meeting this great productivity challenge Australia faces.,78
NA,I now turn to the provisions of the bills before us in turn. I note that the purpose of the,78
NA,Asset Recycling Fund Bill is to establish the Asset Recycling Fund as a dedicated investment,78
NA,vehicle with a focus on providing financial assistance and incentives to states and territories to,78
NA,create new productive infrastructure. The purpose of its companion bill is to make the,78
NA,consequential amendments required to other statutes to enable the effective operation of the,78
NA,"fund. In short, these bills provide an incentive to privatise state or territory owned assets and",78
NA,to recycle the proceeds into new productive infrastructure.,78
NA,While it has been said that this is the only recycling members of this government are,78
NA,"inclined to support, I should point out that this clearly is not so. They are more than happy, as",78
NA,"the member for Grayndler has set out, to recycle and rebrand Labor infrastructure and",78
NA,"investment as their own work. Of course, to talk of recycling in this context is another",78
NA,"example of this government's recourse to Orwellian language. When we talk about recycling,",78
NA,we are of course talking about privatisation.,78
NA,The Commonwealth contribution is to provide the state or territory with an additional 15,78
NA,per cent of the reinvested sale proceeds of the cost of infrastructure projects. These bills are,78
NA,"the vehicle for putting into effect the National Partnership Agreement on Asset Recycling,",78
NA,which was signed by all state and territory leaders in May this year.,78
NA,Under the main bill the fund will receive an initial contribution of $5.9 billion at,78
NA,"commencement, comprising uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund and the",78
NA,Education Investment Fund. Both these funds were formed by the former Labor government,78
NA,to fund land transport and education infrastructure projects respectively. So the money in this,78
NA,"fund is of course Labor money. Under both of these Labor funds, projects to be funded by the",78
NA,"portfolio minister were subject to recommendations by an advisory board as to their merit,",78
NA,NA,78
NA,and crucially this requirement is not duplicated in the legislation before us now. This is a,79
NA,major omission and a major concern.,79
NA,"Privatisation is, to me, far from a self-evident good, although I should point out that Labor",79
NA,"is not opposed in all circumstances to the privatisation of certain public assets, and we will",79
NA,consider and have considered proposals on a case-by-case basis. We will support privatisation,79
NA,only where it is in the public interest to do so following proper independent scrutiny of this,79
NA,process. A case in point is Victorian Labor's proposed leasehold privatisation of the Port of,79
NA,Melbourne in order to fund vital transport infrastructure to replace one-third of Melbourne's,79
NA,level crossings with underpasses or overpasses to increase safety. I am personally very,79
NA,"comfortable in supporting this decision. As alluded to earlier, clearly Labor governments of",79
NA,South Australia and the ACT have signed the Asset Recycling Initiative.,79
NA,"As far as Commonwealth spending on infrastructure goes, in government Labor clearly",79
NA,"leads the way, as of course it should. We saw this in the funding of nation-building",79
NA,"infrastructure projects, including setting governance standards that allow decisions to be made",79
NA,"in the national interest, not on the whims of the National Party or indeed narrow electoral",79
NA,concerns more broadly. Labor lifted infrastructure spending at the Commonwealth to record,79
NA,"levels and, under the previous government, saw Australia rise from 20th in the OECD in",79
NA,terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP to first. We did so without,79
NA,privatisation funding this and without passing the buck to other levels of government. On a,79
NA,"per capita basis, I note we were talking about an increase in funding from $132 per Australian",79
NA,to $225.,79
NA,This is not a debate about privatisation or spending on infrastructure. At issue here are,79
NA,"questions of process, oversight and governance. All of these factors are essential in ensuring",79
NA,that the infrastructure that Australia needs gets built and that Australian taxpayers now and in,79
NA,the future get good value for money in contributing to a more productive economy and,79
NA,enhanced liveability.,79
NA,"Labor's mechanism for achieving these goals was the creation of Infrastructure Australia,",79
NA,the purpose of which has been to research and rank proposed infrastructure projects based on,79
NA,their potential to add to our economic productivity. This was the implementation of an,79
NA,"election commitment, of course. The current governance arrangements are for the",79
NA,"Infrastructure Australia Council, the remit of which is set out in the Infrastructure Australia",79
NA,"Act, to provide advice to the minister. Additionally, the Infrastructure Coordinator was",79
NA,established to assist the council in the performance of its functions. The previous minister,79
NA,made decisions based on advice of this independent panel. The point of this process was to,79
NA,depoliticise infrastructure spending and importantly also to decouple the infrastructure cycle,79
NA,from the all too short political cycle-the long term and the short term-and to establish a,79
NA,"framework, an integrated policy approach for the provision of infrastructure in a strategic",79
NA,manner. This is what I believe nation building should look like. It is Labor's approach.,79
NA,One major piece of infrastructure that Labor committed to and budgeted for was the,79
NA,Melbourne Metro rail link. This was part of an overall investment in urban rail that,79
NA,represented more investment in urban rail infrastructure than that of all of Labor's federal,79
NA,predecessors combined since Federation-over $13½ billion. Stage 1 of this project was,79
NA,identified by Infrastructure Australia as ready to proceed. Infrastructure Australia describes,79
NA,the project as:,79
NA,NA,79
NA,… a project that is expected to shape Melbourne's future transport network and land use patterns. The,80
NA,preferred option presented could achieve up to 30 per cent capacity increase in the urban passenger rail,80
NA,network however the project cost is approximately equal to the benefits.,80
NA,It is not just Infrastructure Australia and federal and state Labor who are in favour of the,80
NA,Melbourne Metro proceeding. Tourism & Transport Forum Chief Executive Ken Morrison,80
NA,"has said that the Melbourne Metro project needed to be funded more swiftly, stating:",80
NA,We urge the government to look at ways to fund the project so it can commence as soon as possible.,80
NA,Committee for Melbourne Chief Executive Officer Kate Roffey has also backed Melbourne,80
NA,"Metro and urged its urgent funding, saying:",80
NA,… we believe waiting until the end of the decade is too long.,80
NA,This is about ensuring that taxpayers get value for money and making sure the projects that,80
NA,are the most necessary go ahead. It would be a tragedy for Melbourne if the Melbourne Metro,80
NA,"is replaced by a half-baked option, which appears likely to be the case should the people of",80
NA,Victoria not get the government they deserve at the end of this year and not get support from a,80
NA,Commonwealth government that is prepared to invest in our cities and especially urban,80
NA,passenger rail.,80
NA,"In Melbourne we are seeing what happens when this process is turned around, with the",80
NA,what can only be described as bizarre announcement by the Prime Minister of funding for the,80
NA,"East West Link, or perhaps the east-east tollway, as it should be described. The Prime",80
NA,"Minister has not seen, and as far as I am aware no Victorians have seen, a business case for",80
NA,this proposal. The decision to fund roads like the east-east tollway breaches another one of the,80
NA,Prime Minister's so-called fundamental election promises-too many broken to count by now.,80
NA,This promise was to subject any infrastructure project worth more than $100 million to cost-,80
NA,"benefit analysis. For this project, the Prime Minister will give the Victorian government",80
NA,"advance payments of $1.5 billion by the end of this month, despite having produced no",80
NA,"business case and despite the fact that $1 billion of this money is for stage 2, construction of",80
NA,which will not begin until 2015-16 and for which we do not even have a map. This breaches,80
NA,another commitment to refuse to hand out money for states unless milestones on planning and,80
NA,construction have been met. This is an absurdity that Labor's amendments would prevent.,80
NA,A secret report prepared by the construction firm Veitch Lister for the Linking Melbourne,80
NA,Authority in June 2003 obtained by The Age found that East West Link will trigger huge,80
NA,"increases in traffic on key sections of Melbourne's road network with parts of Hoddle Street,",80
NA,"already a disaster, amongst the worst hit. The modelling reveals hundreds of thousands of",80
NA,motorists face more rather than less congestion as a direct result of this $6 billion to $8 billion,80
NA,project. Melbourne University planning expert Alan March was quoted as saying the money,80
NA,"being spent on the road would be better invested in public transport, health or education. Dr",80
NA,March warned that international evidence suggested that such projects tended to add to traffic,80
NA,problems over the long term. He said:,80
NA,All of the evidence all over the world suggests these sorts of projects are unlikely to fix things in the,80
NA,longer term … It is as if the government is determined to press ahead with a truck-based transport,80
NA,system at all costs irrespective of the impact on the rest of the city in the longer term.,80
NA,I could not agree more. Why cannot money from the fund established by these bills go,80
NA,towards urban rail? Perhaps this is yet another reason that oversight of infrastructure spending,80
NA,has been reduced and politicisation increased. I remember the Prime Minister wrote in his,80
NA,NA,80
NA,"book Battlelines of 'kings in their cars', and so presumably the rest of us are peasants on",81
NA,public transport to our Prime Minister. The then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime,81
NA,Minister made some strange remarks before the election in asserting that 'the Commonwealth,81
NA,had no history of funding urban rail' and that 'it is important that we stick to our knitting-and,81
NA,the Commonwealth is knitting when it comes to funding infrastructure such as roads.' This,81
NA,sums up this government's approach to this debate. It is just a triumph of the 'I reckon' school,81
NA,"of public policy making, with the two coalition parties working hand in hand-the",81
NA,"ideologically blinkered, who cannot abide public transport, and their friends in the National",81
NA,"Party, the party that brought us regional rorts. We saw that under Howard and we will see it",81
NA,again. The Australasian Railways Association Chief Executive Officer Brian Nye described,81
NA,Mr Abbott as demonstrating that he 'simply doesn't understand public transport.',81
NA,Mr MCCormack interjecting-,81
Mr GILES," Clearly, the Prime Minister is not alone amongst members opposite. Mr Nye",81
NA,also said that this refusal to fund urban rail 'should send shivers down the spine of commuters,81
NA,"everywhere'-as it does, in Scullin and I am sure right across Australia's cities and towns. Mr",81
NA,Nye pointed out that public transport use has almost doubled in Australian cities in the past,81
NA,decade and that more investment is needed to keep our cities from grinding to a standstill over,81
NA,the next 20 years. Grinding to a standstill-what would that mean for the productivity,81
NA,challenge the member for Hume spoke so eloquently about only a few minutes ago? Mr Nye,81
NA,asked:,81
NA,"Clearly not everyone can afford an inner city car parking space, so how does Mr Abbott propose our",81
NA,growing population will get to work each day if he refuses to fund public transport?,81
NA,Mr MCCormack interjecting-,81
Mr GILES," That is a good question, and it is very disappointing that the parliamentary",81
NA,secretary has no interest in the circumstances of four out of five Australians and more than 84,81
NA,"per cent of our economic activity. This is a very good question. In particular, it is a good",81
NA,"question for the constituents of Scullin, Lalor, Makin, Newcastle, Wills and Chisholm-",81
NA,"particularly outer suburban constituents who have little option other than to drive, because",81
NA,"jobs are increasingly located near the CBD at the moment, despite the tight financial",81
NA,constraints many of them live under. I note recent work has highlighted the cost-of-living,81
NA,impact. The cost-of-living impact of effectively requiring outer suburban residents to drive is,81
NA,something that the members opposite were very keen to talk about in opposition but they have,81
NA,little to say about it in government.,81
NA,"In conclusion, it is vital that both amendments proposed by the opposition are supported.",81
NA,This would go some way to bridging the massive chasm between the rhetoric of the,81
NA,government's position on infrastructure and the dismal reality that is condemning Australia's,81
NA,cities and Australia's productivity more generally to a second-best future.,81
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Hon. BC Scott): It being almost 1:30pm, the debate is",81
NA,interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour.,81
NA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,81
NA,Netball Australia Grand Final,81
Ms RYAN ,Lalor-Opposition Whip) (13:29): I stand here today proudly wearing my,81
NA,Victorian navy blue and my Vixens' scarf. There is much excitement about a rugby league,81
NA,NA,81
NA,"match happening tonight, but the real state-on-state action will happen in Melbourne on",82
NA,"Sunday. Melbourne Vixens, led by the great Bianca Chatfield, will face off against",82
NA,"Queensland Firebirds, led by Laura Geitz, in the ANZ Championship netball grand final. I",82
NA,wish both teams all the best in what will be a great display of Aussie netball. Members might,82
NA,like to note that the Australian clubs have dispensed with the clubs from across the ditch to,82
NA,"create this Aussie final. I wish both teams all the best, but will be giving my considerable",82
NA,verbal support to the Vixens to bring home the trophy and the Victorian bragging rights. I,82
NA,cannot think of a better way for our Aussie captain Laura Geitz and vice captain Bianca,82
NA,"Chatfield to prepare for the Commonwealth Games, where they will join forces to fend off",82
NA,those Kiwis. Go Vixens!,82
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Hon. BC Scott): For the benefit of the House, Laura Geitz",82
NA,grew up in the electorate of Maranoa and went to school in Allora. You know who I am,82
NA,backing tonight.,82
NA,Bowel Cancer Awareness Month,82
Mr ALEXANDER ,Bennelong) (13:30): I rise to inform the house about Bowel Cancer,82
NA,Awareness Month: when 'small actions create a big movement'. Bowel cancer is the second,82
NA,"most common cancer in Australia-and our second biggest cancer killer, claiming the lives of",82
NA,"77 Australians every week. We have one of the highest rates of bowel cancer in the world,",82
NA,"with around 15,000 people diagnosed every year. This disease does not discriminate on",82
NA,"gender or age; however, early detection of bowel cancer does save lives, if detected early",82
NA,enough. Unfortunately the five-year survival rate in Australia is just 66 per cent compared to,82
NA,"around 90 per cent for melanoma, breast and prostate cancers.",82
NA,"To draw attention to bowel cancer, the iconic facade of Old Parliament House is this week",82
NA,"being illuminated red and green, the colours of Bowel Cancer Australia's apple logo and the",82
NA,"Bowel Cancer Awareness Month ribbon. This disease is preventable, treatable and beatable,",82
NA,but people need to know about it. Today is Red Apple Day. I urge everyone in this place to,82
NA,purchase a Red Apple pin and munch on a red apple-full of fibre and great for your,82
NA,digestive system-and to spread the message of bowel cancer awareness.,82
NA,Levy on Fruit Growers,82
Ms PARKE ,Fremantle) (13:32): I thank the Deputy Speaker on this red apple day. It is,82
NA,"very appropriate, because last weekend I spoke to my father, who is a fruit grower in",82
NA,"Donnybrook in south-west Western Australia, and I asked him what he thought of the",82
NA,proposal by Woolworths to charge primary producers a so-called voluntary levy to pay for,82
NA,Woolworths' Jamie Oliver advertising campaign. My father said this proposal is breathtaking,82
NA,and obscene. He said:,82
NA,"I have been selling fruit and vegetables for 60 years into the metropolitan market, in Perth and have",82
NA,"had to live with the fact that this is a supply and demand market, as are all the fresh produce markets in",82
NA,Australia.,82
NA,"As with any perishable crop, withholding supply to market is not an option, so growers are in the",82
NA,position of being price-takers rather than price-makers. This is a fundamental imbalance between,82
NA,"products and buyers. We commonly see mark-ups of wholesale to retail of 100 to 1,000 per cent. A",82
NA,"farmer may receive 40c per kilo for their plums, which are then retailed for $4 per kilo, a 1,000 per cent",82
NA,mark-up. This situation is deteriorating even further due to the distorting influence of Australia's two,82
NA,NA,82
NA,supermarket chains. Because we have no anti-trust laws in Australia to prevent this type of market,83
NA,"dominance, it will only get harder for primary producers.",83
NA,Supermarkets commonly sell fresh produce sourced from other countries and use this as a strategy to,83
NA,keep prices for local produce artificially low. Primary producers already pay levies for the promotion of,83
NA,"fresh fruit and vegetables and to have this impost put on them again by a company is untenable, as the",83
NA,company is already effectively dictating the wholesale price that the grower receives.,83
NA,Flynn Electorate: Mt Larcom Show,83
NA,Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (13:33): Mount Larcom is situated halfway between Rockhampton,83
NA,"and Gladstone, and the Mount Larcom Show is on this Saturday and Sunday, 21 and 22 June.",83
NA,"This is a great regional show, and there are some 129 regional shows in Queensland, but the",83
NA,"Mount Larcom one sticks out as one of the best. People come from all over the place,",83
NA,"including Gladstone, Calliope, Rockhampton and, of course, Mount Larcom district.",83
NA,"It is a great agricultural show with much, much more to offer. There are horse events for all",83
NA,"ages, including show jumping, a stud cattle program, poultry, show dogs. They also have ute",83
NA,"masters, chainsaw events, trade displays, market stalls and lots more. Then there is the",83
NA,entertainment-sideshow alley for the kids and young adults alike. Fireworks are on at night,83
NA,"time, and the bar runs late into the night. There is plenty of food, with barbecues and drinks",83
NA,"available throughout the day. Don't miss it; if you are in the area, please attend, because it is a",83
NA,great show.,83
NA,Rankin Electorate: Teaching Symposium,83
Dr CHALMERS ,"Rankin) (13:34): I congratulate and commend Racquel O'Connor, the",83
NA,"principal of Mabel Park State School, in my electorate for convening a symposium last week",83
NA,"on attracting, retaining and developing teachers in Logan-a particular challenge for low SES",83
NA,areas. I was pleased to be able to participate in the opening sessions and delighted to see,83
NA,"representatives of the council, state parliament, unions and universities and local principals",83
NA,there.,83
NA,In some schools in our community close to half the teachers are on short-term contracts-,83
NA,"which means a scramble each term, lots of churn and a lack of continuity in the classrooms.",83
NA,"The difficulty in attracting teachers arises out of a whole lot of issues, some of them around",83
NA,perceptions of our area which a lot of good local people are working hard to turn around.,83
NA,"Compounding these issues, retention and development are compromised by a range of factors,",83
NA,"including lack of flexibility, time and opportunities for capacity-building and support. These",83
NA,"are huge issues for my community, because good teachers make a big difference to the lives",83
NA,of our young people. We heard one statistic that showed that teachers can account for around,83
NA,30 per cent of the difference in student performance and a teacher in the top 10 per cent can,83
NA,do in six months what a teacher in the bottom 10 per cent takes a year to achieve.,83
NA,I want to see the very best teachers in our local schools. Logan should be the first choice,83
NA,for teachers motivated by the chance to make a real difference. Right now not enough high-,83
NA,"performing teachers and graduates are choosing Logan schools, and I will work tirelessly with",83
NA,Racquel and with all the others at her symposium to fix that.,83
NA,Eden-Monaro Electorate: Roads,83
Dr HENDY ,Eden-Monaro) (13:36): My electorate of Eden-Monaro is receiving an early,83
NA,"down payment on the government's increased roads expenditure. On 13 June, last Friday, the",83
NA,NA,83
NA,Deputy Prime Minister visited Queanbeyan. Together with the New South Wales Deputy,84
NA,"Premier Andrew Stoner, he announced a joint funding commitment of $50 million to build the",84
NA,Queanbeyan bypass. The Commonwealth and New South Wales governments have,84
NA,"committed $25 million each to construct a 4.6-kilometre, two-lane carriageway linking the",84
NA,end of Ellerton Drive to the new Edwin Land Parkway intersection at Old Cooma Road. A,84
NA,bridge will also be built over the Queanbeyan River. The extension of Ellerton Drive will,84
NA,provide an alternative route for traffic wanting to bypass Queanbeyan's busy CBD and,84
NA,improve road safety. It is also a major economic development investment for the Queanbeyan,84
NA,district and has been the No. 1 infrastructure priority for the Queanbeyan City Council for a,84
NA,number of years.,84
NA,For those people worried that spending decreases in Canberra will adversely affect,84
NA,"Queanbeyan and Eden-Monaro, can I say that this project will be a massive boost in",84
NA,investment and jobs. The coalition is definitely looking after Eden-Monaro. The,84
NA,Commonwealth government will work closely with both the New South Wales government,84
NA,and the Queanbeyan City Council to deliver this vital piece of regional road infrastructure.,84
NA,We expect that construction of the bypass will start as soon as mid-2015. (Time expired),84
NA,Refugee Council of Australia,84
Mr ZAPPIA ,Makin) (13:36): I note that earlier today the Minister for Immigration and,84
NA,"Border Protection hosted a refugee week function in Parliament House. I also note, that after",84
NA,"having allocated ongoing core funding of $140,000 per year in this year's budget to the",84
NA,"Refugee Council of Australia, the minister then, without explanation, cut the funding. The",84
NA,minister claims that he did not know the funding was in his own budget. This is another,84
NA,example of Abbott government ministers not understanding their own budgets.,84
NA,As Refugee Council of Australia CEO Paul Power said:,84
NA,This decision is petty and vindictive and is symbolic of the Minister's very poor relationship with the,84
NA,non-government sector.,84
NA,The Refugee Council of Australia was founded in 1981 by Major General Paul Cullen and,84
NA,today has a network of 185 organisations and hundreds of members. It is a reputable,84
NA,organisation that has existed for over 30 years. The support that these organisations provide,84
NA,refugees adds value to government funded programs and ultimately saves the taxpayers',84
NA,"funds. This is another example of a mean-spirited, penny-pinching decision of the Abbott",84
NA,"government, where extreme right-wing ideology is driving policy instead of good",84
NA,"government, fairness and common sense.",84
NA,Barker Electorate: Local Government,84
NA,NA,84
NA,this week to welcome mayors from across the electorate of Barker to Canberra. These local,84
NA,government leaders are in Canberra this week for the Australian Local Government,84
NA,Association National General Assembly. They joined me for dinner on Monday night before,84
NA,"attending a series of meetings across the week. This included, of course, time with the",84
NA,"Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Hon. Jamie Briggs, to",84
NA,discuss the important topic of special local roads funding.,84
NA,"The group of mayors visiting from Barker included Alan Arbon from Murray Bridge, Dave",84
NA,"Burgess from Mid Murray Council, Evan Flint from Kingston in the south-east, Peter Hunt",84
NA,NA,84
NA,"from Berri Barmera, Neil Martinson from Renmark Paringa, Robert Sexton from Southern",85
NA,"Mallee, Roger Strother from Coorong, Erika Vickery from Naracoorte Lucindale, and Richard",85
NA,Vickery from the Tatiara.,85
NA,I spent many years as an elected member in local government and continue to have a,85
NA,"tremendous respect for the important work carried out by local councils, particularly in the",85
NA,provision of vital services in regional areas throughout Barker. This week represents a,85
NA,significant opportunity for me to work with those local representatives to engage with the,85
NA,"federal government, and I have enjoyed that opportunity.",85
NA,Iraq,85
NA,Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (13:40): When they invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam,85
NA,"Hussein, the leaders of the Coalition of the Willing, George W. Bush, Tony Blair, and John",85
NA,Howard said they were prepared to accept responsibility for their actions and accept the,85
NA,"verdict of history. Ten years later that verdict is clear. Over a hundred thousand civilian men,",85
NA,"women and children dead, thousands of soldiers dead, over $3 trillion spent-for what? The",85
NA,"breaking of a country and the unleashing of tribal, ethnic and religious hatreds.",85
NA,We would be crazy to go back in there. Neither the Sunni nor Shia leadership in Iraq has,85
NA,"any respect for our values of democracy, pluralism, rights for women, rights for minorities,",85
NA,separation of church and state. They still want to carry on a 1300-year-old fight over who was,85
NA,"the rightful heir to the Prophet Muhammad! Neither of them promotes any form of respect, let",85
NA,"alone affection, for Western nations.",85
NA,"Instead of offering gratuitous advice to President Obama about what he should do now,",85
NA,"those US Republicans and those opposite who arrogantly invaded another country, without",85
NA,"United Nations authorisation, to destroy weapons of mass destruction that did not exist,",85
NA,should get down on their hands and knees and ask forgiveness for having got it so,85
NA,comprehensively wrong and having created such a political and humanitarian catastrophe.,85
NA,Robertson Electorate: Queen's Birthday Honours List,85
NA,Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (13:42): I rise to acknowledge the achievements of three,85
NA,Central Coast residents who have been awarded an Order of Australia Medal in this year's,85
NA,Queen's Birthday Honours List. Philip Donnelly of Killcare was awarded the medal for his,85
NA,service to the Indigenous community through many sporting and charitable initiatives. Phil is,85
NA,"also the president of the Bouddi Society, which organises events and publications related to",85
NA,"the arts and to community, social and environmental issues. Last year, the society staged the",85
NA,"Arts Festival 'Bouddi at Bells', held at Bells at Killcare, where around 600 people helped to",85
NA,"raise $25,000 to support young artists in my community.",85
NA,Shirley Templeton of West Gosford was also awarded an Order of Australia Medal for her,85
NA,service to women and to the Gosford community. Ms Templeton has had extensive,85
NA,"involvement in numerous community organisations, including the Country Women's",85
NA,"Association of New South Wales, Girl Guides Australia and Meals on Wheels.",85
NA,"And another outstanding Central Coast resident, Leonard Sargant, has been awarded an",85
NA,OAM for his ongoing long-term service to Gosford. Len is a local champion. He is the vice-,85
NA,"president of the Gosford Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the treasurer of the Gosford",85
NA,"RSL Sub-Branch, where he is also a director and life member. He was also a state councillor",85
NA,of the Central Coast Region at Clubs NSW from 2009 to 2013.,85
NA,NA,85
NA,"The Central Coast is privileged as a community to benefit from the contributions of Philip,",86
NA,Len and Shirley. They join the company of several other men and women of outstanding,86
NA,"calibre, and I thank them.",86
NA,Sport: Hockey,86
Ms BURKE ,Chisholm) (13:43): I want to pay tribute to an Australian team who defeated,86
NA,"the Netherlands in the Hockey World Cup. That is right, the Kookaburras took down the",86
NA,Netherlands. They demolished the Netherlands 6:1 in the Hockey World Cup last Sunday. It,86
NA,was an amazing effort and something I am sad that we have not played up enough; it has just,86
NA,"not been a media event. But I want to congratulate the ABC, who did actually broadcast these",86
NA,matches for my hockey-mad family. This was a godsend. It was an amazing effort by the,86
NA,"Kookaburras: a 6-1 win, with Victorian Chris Ciriello getting a hat-trick off those amazing",86
NA,"penalty corners and a great win for Ric Charlesworth, who has announced he will be retiring",86
NA,as coach after the Commonwealth Games-and a great effort by Jamie Dwyer in the last,86
NA,"minutes, with Jamie now holding the record equally with Jay Stacey for appearing for the",86
NA,Kookaburras 321 times; an amazing effort.,86
NA,"Whilst the Hockeyroos did not do as well, they also made an amazing effort appearing in",86
NA,"the finals, going down 2-1, also against the Netherlands, on their home turf-if you have ever",86
NA,"watched the Netherlands cheer on a hockey team, you would be surprised at how passionate",86
NA,"they are about this game, as are many people in Australia.",86
NA,I would like to end this statement with great concern about the fear of losing the three,86
NA,"water based pitches we have in Victoria now: one at Monash University, in my seat, which is",86
NA,"going to make way for housing, and the two at the State Netball Hockey Centre, which may",86
NA,go because of the East West Link. This would be a shame.,86
NA,Dobell Electorate: Valley View Public School,86
NA,Mrs MCNAMARA (Dobell) (13:45): I wish to share with the House my recent visit to an,86
NA,"outstanding school in my electorate, Valley View Public School in Wyoming. I would like to",86
NA,"thank the relief principal, Mr Dave Stitt, for his invitation, and to congratulate Dave and his",86
NA,staff on the outstanding work that they are doing at the school. The school motto is,86
NA,"'innovation, opportunity and success', and this is a school which practises what it preaches. I",86
NA,addressed the school assembly and presented flags and certificates of appreciation to students,86
NA,who had participated in the community writing project. Mr Stitt proudly took me to visit the,86
NA,"new Hardware Playzone that is a joint effort by the school, parents and carers of the multi-",86
NA,"categorical class, Central Coast Bunnings Hardware stores, and other local small businesses",86
NA,who supplied labour and materials. This innovative playground is now providing a happy and,86
NA,"safe area for children with ASD, and is shared between the multi-categorical class, the",86
NA,mainstream body and the Glenville Satellite class. It is proof of what can be achieved when,86
NA,the community works together. I especially wish to acknowledge the efforts of Miss Taimi,86
NA,Saxon from the multi-categorical class for her dedication to this project-and whose drive,86
NA,and enthusiasm made it all possible. It was great to join everyone who assisted in the building,86
NA,of the Hardware Playzone at the thank-you morning tea. My visit to the school was completed,86
NA,with a tour where I was able to observe the innovative learning techniques and aids that the,86
NA,school has adopted for their students as part of their curriculum. I look forward to a return,86
NA,visit in the near future.,86
NA,NA,86
NA,Newcastle Electorate: Newcastle East Public School,87
Ms CLAYDON ,Newcastle) (13:47): I rise to pay tribute to a school in my electorate,87
NA,which is visiting us here in Parliament House today: Newcastle East Public School. This,87
NA,"school is Australia's oldest school, celebrating 198 years of continuous service to the children",87
NA,"of inner-city Newcastle. Housed in heritage-listed Gothic buildings, the school fosters an",87
NA,"awareness of its central role in the history of public education in Australia, and operates on",87
NA,the ethos: 'We are a country school in the heart of the city.' When the school opened its doors,87
NA,"in 1816, Newcastle was home to just 400 people, with 17 convict children aged three to 13",87
NA,"years the school's first students. The schoolteacher at the time, Henry Wrensford, was himself",87
NA,a convict on a conditional pardon.,87
NA,"Newcastle East has come a long way over the years, and is now ably led by Principal John",87
NA,"Beach and his team of dedicated educators, providing high-quality, universally-accessible",87
NA,education for all children. Earlier this year I was honoured to attend the launch of the,87
NA,"Newcastle East Public School's bicentenary project, a series of celebratory events to be held",87
NA,"over the next two years, culminating in 2016 when the school will reach the momentous",87
NA,occasion of 200 years of quality public education. Newcastle East Public School will be,87
NA,Australia's first school to celebrate its bicentenary. Congratulations on your 198 years of,87
NA,"education so far, and I can't wait to celebrate your bicentenary with you in 2016!",87
NA,Vinnies CEO Sleepout,87
Ms ODWYER ,"Higgins) (13:48): According to Homelessness Australia, over 100,000",87
NA,people are currently homeless in Australia. Most concerning to me is that thousands of those,87
NA,people are children. Homelessness is a scourge that both civil society and we as legislators,87
NA,have a responsibility and a duty to address. The best way government can reduce,87
NA,homelessness is by putting in place the right framework to educate our youth and to provide,87
NA,them with opportunities. It is also about putting in place a framework that will allow the,87
NA,"economy to grow and prosper and, in turn, create jobs-and it is about putting the right",87
NA,"framework in place to support those people in need. However, no matter how well we do at",87
NA,"all of this, there will sometimes be those who find themselves in vulnerable positions through",87
NA,"no fault of their own-it could be through family breakdown, domestic violence, or mental",87
NA,illness. That is why organisations such as St Vincent de Paul Society are so critical in our,87
NA,"society. These volunteer, not-for-profit organisations help some of the most needy and most",87
NA,vulnerable.,87
NA,"This Thursday night, I will be participating in the Vinnies CEO Sleepout. This will be the",87
NA,"third year that I have taken part. First held in 2008, it is a wonderful initiative which has",87
NA,raised more than $13 million for people who are suffering from homelessness and issues,87
NA,"around poverty, providing education programs, recreation activities and extensive information",87
NA,and referral services. I urge those in this place to support this great cause by supporting those,87
NA,who are taking part in the Vinnies CEO Sleepout.,87
NA,Regional Capitals Australia,87
Ms MCGOWAN ,Indi) (13:50): It gives me great pleasure today to acknowledge the work,87
NA,"of Regional Capitals Australia, and particularly the work of the Wodonga City Council in the",87
NA,formation of this wonderful national organisation. I am a proud champion. There are 50,87
NA,"regional capitals of Australia-cities like Wagga Wagga, Albury-Wodonga, Mackay,",87
NA,NA,87
NA,"Geraldton, Launceston, Mt Gambier and Palmerston-with a total population of four million",88
NA,people and growing. In 2026-that is only 12 years from now-that population is estimated,88
NA,"to be five million people. Regional capitals generate 15 per cent of GDP, at $219 billion.",88
NA,They are the hubs that provide vital services to surrounding towns. I believe regional capitals,88
NA,"hold the future for Australia's growth: they are tourist destinations, hubs supporting the",88
NA,"agribusiness industry, and centres for energy resources, and our regional capitals have, on",88
NA,"average, higher numbers already employed in the tertiary education sector than the rest of",88
NA,Australia.,88
NA,"In closing, I would like to publicly acknowledge the work of two of my constituents in",88
NA,"bringing this idea to the national stage: former Wodonga mayor, Mark Byatt, and Wodonga",88
NA,"City Council CEO, Patience Harrington. While the idea might have begun in WA, it was",88
NA,"Mark and Patience who pioneered a national organisation. It is early days for RCA, but I hope",88
NA,"that when the future history of the 21st century of Australia is written, regional cities will be",88
NA,recognised for their central role.,88
NA,School Chaplaincy,88
Mr SIMPKINS ,Cowan) (13:51): I would like to speak about the National School,88
NA,Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program. Leading up to the budget I received many emails,88
NA,"about this from parents, particularly from Woodvale Primary School. After the funding for",88
NA,"this program was announced in the budget, Pearsall Primary School also contacted me for",88
NA,support in trying to get a chaplain. The chaplains throughout the schools of Cowan are,88
NA,"extraordinarily positive. They make a very strong contribution, and their activities are",88
NA,completely legitimate and above board. A great example was a few years ago at Hudson Park,88
NA,"Primary School, where the then chaplain, Shirley Pyrc, wrote one of the best school songs I",88
NA,have ever heard. They do make an excellent contribution.,88
NA,"I know that some people make allegations about chaplains, and make suggestions about",88
NA,"evangelical activity, but I have never seen this nor have I had a complaint even alleging it in",88
NA,"Cowan. Overwhelmingly, the support for the program is extremely strong, and I hope that the",88
NA,"High Court decision will enable it to continue. In any case, I look forward to the government",88
NA,providing due support to allow the positive contribution of chaplains to continue within the,88
NA,Cowan electorate.,88
NA,"Jenkins, Mr Henry Alfred 'Harry', AO",88
Mr GILES ,Scullin) (13:53): I rise today to draw the attention of members of the House,88
NA,"to the awarding of the Order of Australia to the former member for Scullin, my predecessor,",88
NA,Harry Jenkins.,88
NA,"Honourable members: Hear, hear!",88
Mr GILES," 'Hear, hear!' indeed. To say this award was appropriate is to say the very",88
NA,"least. It represents, in my view-and I am sure in the estimation of many current and former",88
NA,members-due recognition of extraordinary service: service to the communities that make up,88
NA,"the electorate of Scullin; service to the Shire of Whittlesea, in which he also served; service of",88
NA,course to this parliament; and indeed service to public life more generally. It has been said,88
NA,that Harry made a rare contribution to building public trust across his service in this place. I,88
NA,am so pleased to be able to congratulate Harry on this significant award in this place to which,88
NA,"he gave so much, and I look forward to doing so personally.",88
NA,NA,88
NA,State of Origin,89
Mr HAWKE ,Mitchell) (13:54): I want to report to the House that this morning on a,89
NA,"minus one degree, frosty Senate field, the New South Wales Parliamentary Blues defeated",89
NA,Queensland two tries to nothing for the second year in a row. In a game no-one takes,89
NA,"seriously, except perhaps the member for Fisher, Mal Brough, we were lucky to be joined by",89
NA,former NRL stars Nathan Hindmarsh-co-captain with myself for New South Wales-and,89
NA,"Petro Civoneciva, co-captain of Queensland with member for New England Barnaby 'One",89
NA,"Direction' Joyce. We were also joined by NRL CEO Dave Smith who, very fairly, played",89
NA,equally badly for both teams. We thank them all for joining us.,89
NA,"Whilst I would like to say that sport was the winner, it probably wasn't. But I should praise",89
NA,"a few strong performances. Member for Hume, 'Running Man' Angus Taylor, hit a tidy gap to",89
NA,streak away on the end of a beautiful ball held up perfectly and thrown by-who threw that,89
NA,"ball? Was that me? Oh yes, it was me, but it would be hubris to point that out. He crashed",89
NA,through to score the try and win the game off the back of a great pass. Video referee Mark,89
NA,"Simkin from the ABC confirms the pass left the hands backwards, and we all know video",89
NA,"referees never get it wrong! It is also true what they say about the member for Charlton, Pat",89

Mr THISTLETHWAITE ,"Kingsford Smith) (13:55): I pay tribute to Patrick Byrne,",89
NA,"former president of the Coogee Dolphins Rugby League Club, who passed away tragically on",89
NA,"23 May. Patrick Byrne was a remarkable Australian-community minded, fiercely loyal to",89
NA,"his family and friends and, above all, heroic. In 2002, on a night out at the Sari Club in Bali,",89
NA,Patrick left his Coogee Dolphins rugby league teammates to buy cigarettes. What happened,89
NA,"next changed his life forever. A bomb was detonated, killing 202 people, including 88",89
NA,"Australians-20 of those from our community in Kingsford Smith. Wasting no time, Patrick",89
NA,courageously ran back into the inferno and carried several injured people to safety. Despite,89
NA,"his brave efforts, for which he received a bravery award in 2008, six of Patrick's mates died",89
NA,that evening on their end-of-year football trip.,89
NA,"When he returned he put aside his grief to assist family and friends, doing a fundraiser and",89
NA,"earning an NRL community award. With Patrick as president of the club, Coogee won back-",89
NA,to-back A-grade premierships in 2007 and 2008. Speaking at Patrick's funeral in May this,89
NA,"year, an older brother of one of the deceased, Paul Yeo, said of Patrick, 'He just saw too",89
NA,much.' Many said Patrick never got over the guilt of surviving that night. Although the bomb,89
NA,went off in 2002 and some of those involved in this insidious act of terrorism are now being,89
NA,"released from jail, many in Australia continue to suffer and die. I pay tribute to Patrick, and I",89
NA,offer condolences to his family and friends. (Time expired),89

NA,Australia Post,90
Ms HENDERSON ,Corangamite) (13:57): Teesdale residents in the Corangamite,90
NA,electorate currently must collect their mail from the licensed post office at the general store.,90
NA,Many in the community are crying out for street and roadside mail delivery. The problem is,90
NA,that Australia Post has a very undemocratic way of finding out what residents want. It,90
NA,"distributes a survey by hand, and many of these go missing-so if a survey is not returned it is",90
NA,counted as a 'no' vote. This has skewed the result of the two previous mail polls held in,90
NA,Teesdale in Australia Post's favour. The Postal Industry Ombudsman has been very critical of,90
NA,this methodology.,90
NA,"Last week, as a strong local voice for Corangamite I hosted a community meeting in",90
NA,Teesdale. The good news is that Australia Post will hold another mail poll of all 720 homes in,90
NA,"the town, commencing on 7 July. After I made representations to CEO Ahmed Fahour, I am",90
NA,pleased that the poll has been delayed and that information will be placed on Australia Post's,90
NA,website so that residents can be better informed. Delivery of voting forms will also be,90
NA,"improved-they will be cable tied to fences if someone is not home. However, Australia Post",90
NA,is sticking by its unfair method of surveying residents. This is wrong and unjust to country,90
NA,"communities, and needs to change.",90
NA,"Giles, Mr Daniel",90
Ms CHESTERS ,"Bendigo) (13:58): Today I rise to shine a light on Daniel Giles, a",90
NA,"member of my community who is on the autism spectrum. Just recently, Daniel conducted a",90
NA,"24-hour walk with three other people in an effort to raise funds for Turn A Life Around, a",90
NA,program which uses the money from this fundraiser to purchase electronic equipment such as,90
NA,"iPads to assist others with autism. Autism is a growing problem in our communities, and in",90
NA,none more than my own community of Bendigo. Because of the lack of resources that are,90
NA,"being made available, because of the funding cuts we have seen to education, because schools",90
NA,"just do not have the resources that would have been delivered under Gonski, the autism",90
NA,community in my electorate is getting on with the job of funding themselves. Through,90
NA,"fundraisers like Turn A Life Around, through autism walks and through doing their own",90
NA,"community work, they are raising the necessary funds to help their kids to purchase the",90
NA,"equipment they need to get through school. Autism is an issue, and it is a growing issue in our",90
NA,community.,90

Ms BIRD ,"Cunningham) (14:00): My question is to the Prime Minister. Today, Prime",90
NA,"Minister, is National TAFE Day, when we mark the opportunities and training that these",90
NA,important institutions provide for so many young Australians starting out in the workforce.,90
NA,"Why, then, is the Prime Minister determined to destroy opportunities for Australia's 400,000",90
NA,apprentices by cutting almost $1 billion from the Tools for Your Trade program?,90
NA,Government members interjecting-,90
The SPEAKER, There will be silence on my right. The Prime Minister has the call.,90
NA,NA,90
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:00): Like the member who was asked the,91
NA,"question, I value and appreciate the great work that our tradies do. I appreciate the need for",91
NA,proper training systems. The problem is that-,91
NA,NA,91
The SPEAKER, The member for Moreton is not beginning well.,91
Mr ABBOTT," for all their talk, members opposite were much better at spending money",91
NA,"than they were at getting a result. Under the policies of members opposite, some 50 per cent",91
NA,of apprentices never completed their training. So what we want is a better training system.,91
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,91
The SPEAKER, There will be silence from the member for Jagajaga.,91
Mr ABBOTT, Members opposite actually cut $2.4 billion for skills training in the 2012,91
NA,"MYEFO. Members opposite promised 2,650 trade training centres. They delivered fewer than",91
NA,350 of those.,91
NA,Ms Owens interjecting-,91
The SPEAKER, The member for Parramatta will desist.,91
Mr ABBOTT," I want to assure the House that, under this government, money will be",91
NA,invested sensibly and good results will be achieved. We will spend some $5 billion on,91
NA,"training over the forward estimates period. Very importantly, we will be giving trainees",91
NA,access to trade support loans because they deserve support on the same basis that university,91
NA,"students have. We want a fair system, a good system, a flexible system and a productive",91
NA,system. That is what people will get under this government.,91
NA,Budget,91
Ms LANDRY ,Capricornia) (14:02): My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime,91
NA,Minister explain how addressing the debt and deficit mess inherited by this government will,91
NA,strengthen the economy and help families in Capricornia and the rest of the country?,91
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:03): I thank the member for Capricornia,91
NA,for her question. It is an excellent question. I can assure her that this government were elected,91
NA,"to do a number of very important things. We were elected to scrap the carbon tax, because",91
NA,"that will save households $550 a year. We were elected to stop the boats, because that will",91
NA,stop the deaths and also save some $2.5 billion over four years. We were elected to build the,91
NA,"infrastructure of the 21st century, because, thanks to the neglect of state Labor governments,",91
NA,Australia's roads have been turned into the world's longest parking lot. We were elected above,91
NA,all else to clean up Labor's budget mess-,91
NA,Mr Dreyfus interjecting-,91
The SPEAKER, The member for Isaacs will desist.,91
Mr ABBOTT," which had given us the six biggest deficits in history, deficits stretching",91
NA,out as far as the eye can see and debts peaking at $670 billion. As a result of Labor's budget,91
NA,"mess, the Commonwealth is currently borrowing $1 billion every single month. We are",91
NA,borrowing $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on Labor's debt. That is dead,91
NA,money.,91
NA,NA,91
NA,Think what we could do if we were not paying $1 billion every single month just to cover,92
NA,the interest on Labor's debt. Within a year we could fully fund the upgrade of the Bruce,92
NA,Highway. Within two months we could fully fund the Toowoomba range crossing. Within,92
NA,three months we could pay for the Western Sydney infrastructure package. Within six months,92
NA,we could fund the duplication of the Pacific Highway. In over 12 months we could fund the,92
NA,East West Link in Melbourne. In one month we could fund the north-south road in Adelaide.,92
NA,In a month we could fund the Gateway Motorway upgrade in Brisbane. In just two weeks we,92
NA,could fund the Midland Highway project in Tasmania. In less than a week we could fund the,92
NA,Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. In less than a month we could fund the Perth,92
NA,Gateway and in another month we could more than fund the Swan Valley bypass.,92
NA,Mr Albanese interjecting-,92
The SPEAKER, The member for Grayndler will desist.,92
NA,Mr Albanese interjecting-,92
The SPEAKER, The member for Grayndler is warned.,92
Mr ABBOTT, I say to the member for Grayndler that the Labor Party were economic,92
NA,vandals in office and in opposition they are even worse. The Leader of the Opposition is,92
NA,groaning and moaning on the other side of the ministerial table. He is all complaint and no,92
NA,"solution. Members opposite stand for bigger deficits, more debt and open borders.",92
NA,Budget,92
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (14:06): My question is to the,92
NA,Prime Minister. The very last day before the last election the Prime Minister promised,92
NA,"Australians no cuts to education, no cuts to health and no changes to pensions. Now that the",92
NA,"Prime Minister has cut $80 billion from schools and hospitals and has cut indexation to carers,",92
NA,"veterans and pensioners, did the Prime Minister seriously expect the people of Australia to",92
NA,"believe him when he said yesterday, 'This is an honest budget'?",92
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:06): This is the right budget for Australia,92
NA,because it tackles Labor's debt and deficit disaster. As for the figure that the Leader of the,92
NA,"Opposition bandies about, I challenge him to produce one of the Labor Party's budgets which",92
NA,has that figure in it. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to come up with a single Labor,92
NA,budget with that figured in it.,92
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,92
Mr Burke," Madam Speaker, on a point of order on relevance, there is a request to the",92
NA,Prime Minister for authentication. He has to look at his own budget documents for the cut.,92
NA,Labor never made that cut.,92
The SPEAKER, There is no point of order. The member will resume his seat. The Prime,92
NA,Minister has the call.,92
Mr ABBOTT, There is no cut because there was no budget that contained it from,92
NA,members opposite.,92
NA,Mr Burke interjecting-,92
The SPEAKER," the Leader of the Opposition is abusing the standing orders, and he",92
NA,knows it and will not do it again.,92
NA,NA,92
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,93
Mr ABBOTT, There is no Labor budget that made the commitment that the Leader of the,93
NA,"Opposition refers to. This was a pie-in-the-sky, undeliverable promise from the Labor Party,",93
NA,"that was never contained in any single budget. When it comes to schools, let me be very clear,",93
NA,"there is an eight per cent increase this year, an eight per cent increase next year, an eight per",93
NA,"cent increase the year after that, and a six per cent increase in the final year. When it comes to",93
NA,"public hospitals, there is a nine per cent increase this year, a nine per cent increase next year, a",93
NA,"nine per cent increase the year after that, and a six per cent increase in the final year.",93
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,93
Mr ABBOTT," On the question of indexation, members opposite changed the indexation",93
NA,of the family tax benefit from male total average weekly earnings to CPI. Members opposite,93
NA,demonstrated by their actions that the CPI is a fair indexation system. If it was fair for,93
NA,"members opposite to do it for the family tax benefit, it is fair for this government to do it to",93
NA,"other benefits. If it was fair for Labor to do it, it is fair for the coalition to do it. This is a fair",93
NA,"budget, an honest budget, and above all else, it is the right budget for Australia because it",93
NA,deals with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We have our plan to deal with Labor's debt and,93
NA,deficit disaster. We have demonstrated how we are going to clean up Labor's mess. It is about,93
NA,time that Labor demonstrated how they will clean up the mess they created.,93
NA,NA,93
NA,Minister during his answer-trying to hear the Prime Minister's response was almost,93
NA,impossible on this side of the House because of the wall of noise coming from the empty,93
NA,vessels on that side of the House. I would ask you to assist at least the electors of Australia to,93
NA,be able to hear the answers from the Prime Minister without the empty vessels opposite,93
NA,making so much noise.,93
Mr Burke," Madam Speaker, on behalf of the opposition, we have the same trouble with",93
NA,the cheering that goes on from their back bench.,93
The SPEAKER, The member will resume his seat. There will be silence so that we can,93
NA,hear the member for Wright who has been given the call.,93
NA,Budget,93
Mr BUCHHOLZ ,Wright-Government Whip) (14:10): I have an excellent question to,93
NA,deliver to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer explain to the House how repairing the budget,93
NA,mess that this government inherited will change the Australian economy for the better into the,93
NA,future?,93
Mr HOCKEY ,North Sydney-The Treasurer) (14:11): I thank the honourable member,93
NA,for Wright for that question. He is an indefatigable advocate for good economic policy. He,93
NA,has been in the door on regular occasions and has been a strong advocate for government to,93
NA,"live within its means. As the Prime Minister just said, this is a very fair budget and a very",93
NA,honest budget. I know that comes as a rude shock to the Labor Party given they delivered six,93
NA,"budgets in a row from the member for Lilley, that were both unfair and dishonest. No budget",93
NA,could be more dishonest than the one delivered by the member for Lilley when he claimed,93
NA,"that he was announcing on that night four budget surpluses in a row. We miss you, Swannie!",93
NA,"Now of course he is writing a book-or actually, the Parliamentary Library is writing a book",93
NA,on his behalf-and we look forward to the wisdom that comes from that book.,93
NA,NA,93
NA,"The legacy of six years of Labor was $667 billion of debt, if no action is taken. Somehow",94
NA,they tend to believe that a number like that is pretty irrelevant-$667 billion with no,94
NA,surpluses on the horizon. The interest that the Australian people would pay on that $667,94
NA,"billion would be $3 billion a month. Currently, we are paying $1 billion a month, but the",94
NA,"legacy of Labor waste and expenditure lifted it to $3 billion a month, and 70 per cent of that",94
NA,goes to people living overseas because they are the people that have lent us the money.,94
NA,"There has been a lot of debate about whether it is a budget emergency or a budget crisis, so",94
NA,I want to go-,94
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,94
Mr HOCKEY, They are laughing! I am glad they are because I just want to cite someone,94
NA,very close to the Labor Party. That is why Swannie has got his head down-and you should,94
NA,"all learn from him. The Reserve Bank of Australia board member John Edwards, principal",94
NA,"adviser to Paul Keating and appointed by the Labor Party to the Reserve Bank, said yesterday:",94
NA,I've no doubt there is a budget crisis-,94
NA,"Hello, someone in the Labor Party that understands economics knows that it is a budget crisis!",94
NA,He went on:,94
NA,"We're accumulating debt as a higher share of GDP and of course in absolute terms, [it's] absolutely",94
NA,"astronomical compared to far more serious episodes in Australian history, including recoveries from",94
NA,serious recessions.,94
NA,"If we do not do something about the debt and deficit legacy of Labor, we will face a crisis in",94
NA,Australia. In fact a Reserve Bank board member appointed by the Labor Party says that it,94
NA,exists now so to Labor I say: get out of the way and let us fix the budget!,94
NA,Budget,94
Ms PLIBERSEK ,Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:14): My question is to,94
NA,the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's last answer and his continued denials that,94
NA,he is cutting health and education. Yesterday the New South Wales treasurer said that the,94
NA,Prime Minister's cuts to schools and hospitals are 'leaving the states $80 billion worse off'.,94
NA,Why is the Prime Minister continuing to deceive Australians about his $80 billion cuts to,94
NA,schools and hospitals?,94
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:14): I am pleased that the Deputy Leader,94
NA,"of the Opposition has asked me about the New South Wales budget, because the budget that",94
NA,the New South Wales Treasurer has brought down is a very good budget. It builds on the,94
NA,"outstanding work of the former treasurer, now Premier Mike Baird, who is really doing very",94
NA,good work indeed. Commonwealth funding to New South Wales is increasing by $5.8 billion,94
NA,thanks to the budget that we brought down. Commonwealth spending to New South Wales is,94
NA,up by $5.8 billion thanks to the budget that this Commonwealth government brought down a,94
NA,"few weeks ago, and that is $1.4 billion more than would have been the case under the policies",94
NA,"of members opposite. Right around this country, thanks to the budget that we brought down,",94
NA,the states will be $9 billion better off over the next four years. This is a bonanza for the state,94
NA,governments under this government; it is an infrastructure bonanza. It is not just unsustainable,94
NA,"recurrent spending, because this government is shifting spending out of short-term",94
NA,"consumption and into long-term investment, because that is what we want to do. We want to",94
NA,NA,94
NA,build a strong and prosperous economy so that over the long term our country will be safe and,95
NA,secure.,95
NA,"Again, for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in New South Wales, year",95
NA,"on year, hospital funding grows by eight per cent, 10 per cent, 10 per cent and eight per cent.",95
NA,"In New South Wales, year on year, schools funding grows by seven per cent, eight per cent,",95
NA,nine per cent and six per cent. This Commonwealth government is investing $15 billion in,95
NA,"infrastructure in New South Wales. I am very proud of that, because there is a terrible",95
NA,infrastructure gap in New South Wales because of the neglect of members opposite. Because,95
NA,"of the neglect of members opposite, roads in Sydney are some of the world's longest car",95
NA,"parks. Well, that is going to change under this government. I am determined to be the",95
NA,"infrastructure Prime Minister, and I am proud that with the help of this government Mike",95
NA,Baird will be the infrastructure Premier.,95
NA,World Heritage Areas,95
Mr WILKIE ,Denison) (14:17): My question is to the Prime Minister. The UN will,95
NA,"shortly decide Australia's request to delist 74,000 hectares of Tasmanian World Heritage",95
NA,"forests. Regardless of the government's position, will you respect the World Heritage",95
NA,Committee's final decision and not attempt any unprecedented unilateral withdrawal from the,95
NA,"World Heritage framework? And before taking any final action, will you at least give me time",95
NA,to bring a petition to the parliament next week in support of maintaining the listing?,95
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:18): I thank the member for Denison for,95
NA,his question. Of course he has a perfect right to bring petitions to this parliament on any,95
NA,"subject at any time, and I respect the member's commitment to the environment. But I do say,",95
NA,"in response to the member for Denison, that I too am a conservationist and I regard myself as",95
NA,as much of a conservationist as any member of this parliament.,95
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,95
NA,NA,95
The SPEAKER, There will be silence on my left. The member for Moreton is warned.,95
Mr ABBOTT, The challenge that all of us in this parliament face in respect of the great,95
NA,state of Tasmania is to try to ensure that the great state of Tasmania is an economy as well as,95
NA,a national park. We need to ensure that the great state of Tasmania is a strong economy as a,95
NA,well as a beautiful national park. We need to ensure that the great state of Tasmania is a good,95
NA,place to work as well as-,95
Mr Wilkie," Madam Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the essence of the question is",95
NA,whether or not-,95
The SPEAKER, There is no point of order.,95
Mr ABBOTT, I understand and appreciate and share the commitment of the member for,95
NA,Denison to Tasmania's forests. They are great renewable resources as well as pristine and,95
NA,"beautiful places, and I want the people of Tasmania to be able to work in forests as well as to",95
NA,walk in forests. I want people to be able to make a living from forests as well as to appreciate,95
NA,"their natural beauty. This is a question of getting the balance right, and the member for",95
NA,Denison can trust this government to do just that.,95
NA,NA,95
Mr Wilkie," Madam speaker, a further point of order: the question asked for really a yes or",96
NA,no-,96
The SPEAKER," No, there is no point of order.",96
NA,Carbon Pricing,96
Mr GOODENOUGH ,Moore) (14:20): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the,96
NA,Treasurer inform the House of the consequences of a failure to repeal the carbon tax? How,96
NA,will the carbon tax continue to damage the economy if it is not repealed?,96
Mr HOCKEY ,North Sydney-The Treasurer) (14:20): I thank the honourable member,96
NA,for Moore for his question. I note that he is a very worthy successor to his hugely impressive,96
NA,"predecessor. Coming from Western Australia, he knows how important it is to repeal the",96
NA,carbon tax. I regret to inform the House that as a result of Labor's refusal to terminate the,96
NA,carbon tax the carbon tax will go up on 1 July this year from $24.15 a tonne to $25.40 a,96
NA,tonne-a five per cent increase in the carbon tax. If the Labor Party let us keep our election,96
NA,"promise to get rid of the carbon tax, and if Labor were not blocking the repeal of the carbon",96
NA,"tax, then we could get rid of the carbon tax immediately and prevent it going up on 1 July",96
NA,next year. They have already had a chance to support our repeal of the carbon tax laws. We,96
NA,are going to give them another chance next week to repeal that carbon tax laws before the,96
NA,"carbon tax goes up again, on 1 July.",96
NA,We know the Leader of the Opposition has been running around to a few business groups,96
NA,in the last 24 hours. He spoke to the CEO's of some foreign entities and to the Business,96
NA,Council of Australia. What he has is one message for business and another message for the,96
NA,"public. The message to businesses is along the lines, 'Don't worry, that carbon tax is going to",96
NA,"go.' But to the public he says, 'Hang on, we are fighting to keep the carbon tax, because we",96
NA,want to see your electricity prices rise.' And rise they will.,96
NA,Getting rid of the carbon tax on average relieves each household of $550 in costs. It was,96
NA,"almost one year ago that Kevin Rudd-remember him?-stated before the election, in the",96
NA,"electorate of Herbert, in Townsville:",96
NA,The Labor government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help cost-of-living pressures for,96
NA,families and to reduce the costs for small business.,96
NA,"There was Kevin, under the palm trees, up there with the member for MCMahon right by his",96
NA,side-I hope he has not forgotten that. The member for MCMahon was there saying that,96
NA,terminating the carbon tax was part of our positive economic plan.,96
NA,"But that was 12 months ago-like, they don't keep their promises.",96
NA,Mr Shorten interjecting-,96
Mr HOCKEY," When it comes to being loyal and honest, you are not at the top of the",96
NA,"queue, Bill. One of the best examples of that is your backflip on the carbon tax.",96
NA,Budget,96
Mr BOWEN ,MCMahon) (14:23): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime,96
NA,Minister to his continued denials that he is cutting health and education funding. I also refer to,96
NA,Standard and Poor's statement on yesterday's New South Wales budget:,96
NA,The state government faced cuts to health and education funding from the Commonwealth,96
NA,government.,96
NA,NA,96
NA,Why is the Prime Minister continuing to deceive the Australian people about his $80 billion,97
NA,of cuts?,97
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:24): For the benefit of the person who,97
NA,"asked the question, let me repeat that every year school and hospital funding goes up under",97
NA,"this government, and every year school and hospital money for the state governments goes up.",97
NA,The shadow Treasurer really should quote more completely if he is going to be taken,97
NA,"seriously. If he wants to quote one, let me quote another. The Deutsche Bank Research Report",97
NA,"2014-15, released yesterday, stated:",97
NA,We note that Commonwealth grants to New South Wales have actually increased over the forward,97
NA,"projection period, relevant to the 2013-14 budget update.",97
NA,This government is not only delivering more money to schools and hospitals but it is also,97
NA,"tackling Labor's debt and deficit disaster. That is why it is not only an honest budget, not only",97
NA,"a truthful budget, but it is the budget Australia needs for these times.",97
NA,Asylum Seekers,97
NA,Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (14:25): My question is to the Minister for Immigration and,97
NA,Border Protection. Will the minister inform the House of the measures taken in the budget to,97
NA,provide education services to the children of illegal maritime arrivals on Christmas Island and,97
NA,what challenges these measures will address? How are the government's policies fixing the,97
NA,mess the government inherited on our borders?,97
Mr MORRISON ,Cook-Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (14:26): I,97
NA,"thank the member for Solomon for her question. She will be pleased to know, as I know all",97
NA,"members on this side of the House are, that given that we have now had almost six months of",97
NA,"no successful people smuggling ventures to Australia, it is saving the budget $2.5 billion. In",97
NA,"addition to that, it is ensuring that we have freed up 20,000 places in our special humanitarian",97
NA,"program over this year out to the end of the forward estimates. Further to that, it has freed up",97
NA,"more than 1,000 places for women at risk, which we noted earlier today at the opening of",97
NA,Refugee Week.,97
NA,What we found when we came to government was not that arrangement. We found,97
NA,"something very different. By stopping the boats, we are able not only to get the budget under",97
NA,control and get the refugee and humanitarian program back under control and ensure it has,97
NA,"integrity, but we are able to deal with the problems in the detention network and with the",97
NA,issues with offshore processing that were left to us by the previous government. Labor did,97
NA,leave us a mess. They left us a mess because $1.2 billion was the shortfall in funding for,97
NA,effectively implementing offshore processing. They announced it but they did not fund it.,97
NA,They are great on announcements-they announce surpluses that are never delivered and they,97
NA,announce offshore processing policies that were never funded.,97
NA,In addition to that there was inadequate infrastructure for children-for families. After their,97
NA,involvement in those offshore centres they had processed no-one at all. Not one. More than,97
NA,100 people have received decisions and recommendations now under the arrangements put in,97
NA,"place in Papua New Guinea and Nauru-and there were no resettlement arrangements, none",97
NA,at all.,97
NA,I am asked quite specifically by the member for Solomon about the issues on Christmas,97
NA,Island. I can tell you that at the last election the previous government had provided education,97
NA,NA,97
NA,to just 24 children on Christmas Island. There is a slight problem with that in that there were,98
NA,"140 primary-age children on Christmas Island at the time, and there were 425 children on",98
NA,Christmas Island at the time. That was addressed in this budget. There is $2.6 million to,98
NA,ensure that not just 24 children but every child held in detention on Christmas Island will go,98
NA,to school every single day. That is just one of the examples of cleaning up the mess. But the,98
NA,"job is getting easier, because the number of children in detention is declining. The number of",98
NA,"children right across our own networks and offshore is now fewer than 1,000. It has fallen by",98
NA,a third since the election. It has fallen by almost 50 per cent in mainland centres across,98
NA,Australia. You know how you get children out of detention? You stop the boats. That is how,98
NA,you do it. That is what this government is doing. That is why children are coming out of,98
NA,detention and that is why this government has been successful and you lot failed.,98

Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (14:29): My question is to the,98
NA,Prime Minister. I refer to this fact sheet circulated by the member for Perth to her,98
NA,constituents.,98
The SPEAKER, We do not use props.,98
Mr SHORTEN," I am just referring to it. It says, 'The government is delivering on its",98
NA,election commitment to support veterans by improving-,98
NA,Government members interjecting-,98
Mr SHORTEN, I meant the member for Curtin. I refer to the fact sheet sent out by our,98
NA,"friend the Minister for Foreign Affairs which says, 'The government is delivering on its",98
NA,election commitment to support veterans by improving the way that their pensions are,98
NA,indexed.' Given that the Prime Minister is actually cutting the indexation of veterans',98
NA,"pensions, why are members of his government using taxpayers' money to peddle his lies?",98
The SPEAKER, The Leader of the Opposition will rephrase the last part of his question.,98
Mr SHORTEN, Given that the Prime Minister is actually cutting indexation of veterans',98
NA,"pensions, why are members of his government using taxpayers' money to peddle the fairytales",98
NA,of this Prime Minister?,98
The SPEAKER, I am not sure that was much of an improvement.,98
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:31): I can understand why the Leader of,98
NA,the Opposition is a bit obsessed with the member for Perth-because she is the member who,98
NA,wants to scrap the mining tax! The newsletter put out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is,98
NA,entirely accurate. It is entirely accurate because we are improving indexation for the DFRDB,98
NA,and the DFRB pensions-as we promised. We are delivering precisely on our promise. But,98
NA,"when it comes to dodgy newsletters, what about the Leader of the Opposition's?",98
The SPEAKER, We are not having a competition in props. There will be none.,98
Mr ABBOTT, His newsletter-I must say that he looks a bit younger in the photograph,98
NA,"in that newsletter; the pressure is getting to him-from 2012 promised, in big print on the",98
NA,"front page, 'a budget surplus for a strong economy'. When? Throughout this mendacious",98
NA,document-,98
NA,"Ms Macklin: On a point of order, Madam Speaker: page 203 of your budget papers shows",98
NA,cuts to veterans' pensions.,98
NA,NA,98
The SPEAKER, There is no point of order.,99
Mr ABBOTT," When it comes to newsletters, the Leader of the Opposition is an",99
NA,absolutely serial deceiver of his electorate and a serial deceiver of the Australian people. If,99
NA,"you cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition even to get a question right, why would you",99
NA,ever trust him with the future of this country?,99
NA,International Aid Program,99
NA,"WYATT ROY (Longman) (14:33): To help members opposite, my question is to the",99
NA,"member for Curtin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of the",99
NA,"steps the government is taking to ensure Australia's aid program is responsible, sustainable",99
NA,and affordable?,99
NA,Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:33): I thank the member,99
NA,"for Longman for his question and I can inform the House that this afternoon, at the National",99
NA,"Press Club, I launched the Australian government's new aid policy and our new strategic",99
NA,direction for the $5 billion-a-year aid program that makes Australia one of the top 10 donors,99
NA,in the OECD. I really want to thank the Deputy of Leader of the Opposition for her full,99
NA,endorsement of our aid program. Her media release referred to 'the Abbott government's fresh,99
NA,new approach on overseas aid'. Thank you very much; I appreciate that.,99
NA,What we are doing is focusing on our region-90 per cent of our aid budget will be,99
NA,focused on the Indian Ocean-Asia Pacific. We are going to develop innovative ways to,99
NA,"engage the private sector to promote economic development, to reduce poverty and to lift",99
NA,standards of living in our region. We will put in place performance benchmarks and mutual,99
NA,obligations with partner countries and we will work for better results. We are going to focus,99
NA,"our aid investment on health and education, building capacity in workforces, infrastructure",99
NA,"and, importantly, empowering women and girls. It is a fresh new approach. There will be no",99
NA,"more raiding of the aid budget to cover Labor's blow-out in onshore-that is right, 'onshore'-",99
NA,processing costs. Seven hundred and forty million dollars was ripped out of the aid budget to,99
NA,cover their blow-outs in the immigration budget.,99
NA,"You would have thought that, having left an interest bill of $1 billion a month on their",99
NA,"borrowings, Labor would have developed some sort of responsible approach. But I could not",99
NA,believe it when yesterday the member for Kingsford Smith recommitted Labor to increasing,99
NA,the aid budget by $16 billion. Where is the money coming from? More debt! But you should,99
NA,not expect too much from the member for Kingsford Smith. Back when he was in,99
NA,"government, he was telling us that he was eminently qualified to be the Parliamentary",99
NA,Secretary-this is serious-for Pacific Island Affairs because he regularly swims at Sydney,99
NA,beaches! There it is. He is an expert on the Pacific because he goes swimming on Sydney,99
NA,beaches! What next? You are a Pacific expert because you can see Fiji from your electorate?,99
NA,"The Australian government will deliver a responsible, affordable, sustainable aid budget-",99
NA,and I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her endorsement of our new policy.,99
NA,Budget,99
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (14:36): My question is to the,99
NA,"Prime Minister. According to The Courier Mail, the Prime Minister is sending personalised",99
NA,letters to 2½ million age pensioners angry over budget cuts. Why is the Prime Minister,99
NA,wasting taxpayers' money writing a letter when he should be rewriting his whole budget?,99
NA,NA,99
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:37): Any letter that this government,100
NA,"sends to people will at least be truthful, unlike the Leader of the Opposition's letter claiming,",100
NA,"in 2012, that a budget surplus had been delivered. Is that true?",100
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER, All members will put props down.,100
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER," No, you won't. Down.",100
Mr ABBOTT, Something else the Leader of the Opposition sent out to the public of,100
NA,"Australia–I don't want to display it, but I am reading from it: 'Carbon tax abolished'. I stand",100

NA,Ms Owens interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER," The Leader of the Opposition will desist, and so will the member for",100
NA,Parramatta.,100
Mr ABBOTT, given that he sent material out to the people of Australia claiming 'carbon,100
NA,tax abolished'. Really and truly. The barefaced gall. The absolute hide. The sheer front of this,100
NA,person. An absolute serial deceiver of the Australian people-just as he was a serial deceiver,100
NA,of former Prime Minister Rudd and former Prime Minister Gillard.,100
Mr Dreyfus, Nobody believes you!,100
The SPEAKER, The member for Isaacs will withdraw.,100
Mr Dreyfus, I withdraw.,100
Mr Burke," Madam Speaker, a point of order-",100
The SPEAKER," It had better be good, in the light of the commentary that is coming",100
NA,across the table from the Leader of the Opposition.,100
Mr Burke, It is on direct relevance.,100
The SPEAKER, This is a very wide-ranging question. The Prime Minister has the call,100
NA,and the Leader of the Opposition will desist commentary across the table.,100
Mr ABBOTT," Really and truly. For this Leader of the Opposition, for this serial deceiver",100
NA,"of the Australian people, to complain about a letter that might be sent out by this government",100
NA,to tell the Australian people-,100
NA,Ms Kate Ellis interjecting-,100
NA,Ms Plibersek interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER," The member for Adelaide will desist, and the member for Sydney.",100
Mr ABBOTT," that pensions will go up every March and every September, every single",100
NA,"year, really and truly. If this Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about telling the truth-",100
NA,Mr Dreyfus interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER, The member for Isaacs is warned.,100
Mr ABBOTT," if this Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about being trustworthy, we",100
NA,are coming up to the fourth anniversary of-,100
NA,NA,100

The SPEAKER, The member for Sydney is warned.,101
Mr ABBOTT," his trustworthiness to Prime Minister Rudd, and we are coming up to the",101
NA,first anniversary of his trustworthiness to Prime Minister Gillard. If Prime Minister Rudd and,101
NA,"Prime Minister Gillard could not trust this Leader of the Opposition, the Australian people",101
NA,never can.,101
NA,Higher Education,101
NA,Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (14:40): My question is to the Minister for Education. Will the,101
NA,"minister inform the House how the government's higher-education reforms, announced in the",101
NA,"budget, will help more students gain a higher-education qualification on the New South Wales",101
NA,Central Coast and in other regional areas?,101
NA,NA,101
NA,member for Robertson for her question. Yesterday I was very fortunate to meet with the,101
NA,"mayors of Wyong and Gosford, from the New South Wales Central Coast, who are both very",101
NA,ably represented by the member for Dobell and the member for Robertson. They were very,101
NA,pleased to hear how the government's higher-education reforms will be of such enormous,101
NA,benefit to a regional area like the Central Coast of NSW.,101
NA,It will be of benefit in three particular ways. They were very pleased to hear that because,101
NA,"we are extending taxpayer subsidies, per student, to non-university higher-education providers",101
NA,that will be a financial shot in the arm to the four TAFEs that exist on the Central Coast of,101
NA,New South Wales; and on National TAFE Day it is good to be able to explain to TAFEs that,101
NA,"they will get a large financial support out of the government, because of that first aspect of",101
NA,our reforms.,101
NA,"Secondly, of course, we are removing the cap on diplomas and associate degrees so that",101
NA,universities-like the University of Newcastle-which offer a high preponderance of such,101
NA,"associate degrees and diplomas, especially on the Central Coast, will be able to expand their",101
NA,"offerings to students in an area that will service, eventually, 400,000 people on the NSW",101
NA,"Central Coast. That will be a widening of opportunity to more students, particularly for those",101
NA,"of low-socioeconomic-status backgrounds, who typically use those kinds of courses to go into",101
NA,undergraduate degrees and find a pathway to university.,101
NA,"Finally, if the University of Newcastle does not take up the opportunity of both the lifting",101
NA,of the cap and the expansion of the Commonwealth Grant Scheme's non-university higher,101
NA,"education providers, then the competition that we have created in the market will allow new",101
NA,entrants into the Central Coast of New South Wales to compete with the University of,101
NA,"Newcastle, so forcing the University of Newcastle to, in fact, offer those courses-if they",101
NA,"want to keep their market-or the new providers, using the new freedoms of a deregulated",101
NA,"system, will be able to give low-SES young people on the New South Wales Central Coast",101
NA,the opportunity to get a higher-education qualification and improve their chances of,101
NA,increasing their income over a lifetime.,101
NA,"It is very good news for regional Australia, in the higher-education reforms, and the",101
NA,mayors were very pleased to see it. These two measures alone are costing $820 million. So,101
NA,our priorities are to put $820 million into higher education. Labor's priority is to spend $1,101
NA,billion a month-being sent to debtors overseas-to pay the interest alone on the,101
NA,NA,101
NA,government's debt that was left to us by Labor. Labor's priority is a billion dollars a month in,102
NA,interest repayments; ours is $820 million to expand opportunity.,102
NA,Budget,102
NA,Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (14:44): My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime,102
NA,"Minister, on Sunday, the member for Hume emailed his constituents, telling them: 'The GP",102
NA,"co-payments will not apply to those who cannot afford to pay.' Clearly, this is wrong. Prime",102
NA,"Minister, why are you, your MPs, ministers, continuing to tell falsehoods about the budget?",102
NA,Mr Champion interjecting-,102
The SPEAKER, The member for Wakefield will desist.,102
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:44): I am not sure what letter might have,102
NA,"been sent out by the member for Hume; but I tell you what, it would not have been any better",102
NA,than the member for Fraser's letter:,102
NA,"But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all … the",102
NA,ideal model involves a small co-payment-,102
Mr Burke," Madam Speaker, on a point of order: if direct relevance now means that if the",102
NA,"question says 'a letter' then any letter is relevant, this takes direct relevance to a bizarre place.",102
The SPEAKER, There is no point of order. The member will resume his seat. The Prime,102
NA,Minister has the call.,102
Mr ABBOTT, I am trying to compare the letter of the member for Hume with the letter of,102
NA,"the member for Fraser. I am sure the member for Hume's letter was a fine letter, but I doubt",102
NA,"whether he would have been able to do as well as the member for Fraser, who said:",102
NA,"But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all … the",102
NA,"ideal model involves a small co-payment-not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough",102
NA,to make you think twice before you call the doc.,102
NA,"Good on the member for Fraser, who went on to say:",102
NA,And the idea is hardly radical.,102
NA,"So, if the member for Hume is simply repeating the wisdom of the member for Fraser, good",102
NA,on the member for Hume.,102
NA,Mr Champion interjecting-,102
The SPEAKER, The member for Wakefield!,102
Mr ABBOTT, Members opposite made a big mistake with the member for Fraser. When,102
NA,they heard he was at the ANU they thought it was the AMWU-that is what it was. But it was,102
NA,"a university, not a union!",102
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,102
The SPEAKER, There will be silence on my left.,102
Mr ABBOTT," It was a place where they are committed to the truth, not where they are",102
NA,committed to slush funds and corruption.,102
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,102
The SPEAKER, The Prime Minister will resume his seat. We cannot hear the answer.,102
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,102
NA,NA,102
The SPEAKER, The noise is so loud that the Prime Minister could not hear my request,103
NA,for him to resume his seat. I would say to the member for Fraser that he has given himself a,103
NA,yellow card. Next time it will be a red card and he will take an hour's leave.,103
NA,Infrastructure,103
Dr GILLESPIE ,Lyne) (14:47): My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and,103
NA,Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the minister outline the,103
NA,"government's plan for infrastructure development in New South Wales-in particular, the",103
NA,"plan to duplicate the Pacific Highway, which runs through my electorate of Lyne?",103
Mr TRUSS ,Wide Bay-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and,103
NA,"Regional Development) (14:48): I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question,",103
NA,because New South Wales receives almost $15 billion under the coalition's $50 billion,103
NA,infrastructure investment plan.,103
NA,Mr Champion interjecting-,103
The SPEAKER, The member for Wakefield is warned.,103
Mr TRUSS, What a difference that is going to make to the road system in New South,103
NA,"Wales, both in Sydney and in provincial centres, and of course there is $5.6 billion for the",103
NA,"Pacific Highway. Finally, the dream of duplicating the Pacific Highway all the way from",103
NA,Sydney to Brisbane will be achieved.,103
NA,Mr Albanese interjecting-,103
The SPEAKER, The member for Grayndler has been warned. One more utterance and he,103
NA,will leave.,103
Mr TRUSS, There is $5.6 billion on the table over six years to complete that task. Before,103
NA,the end of this year the $115 million upgrade of the Kundabung to Kempsey sections and the,103
NA,$683 million for the Oxley Highway to Kundabung section will be underway. They will be,103
NA,major projects that will employ many people on the way but will also make a real difference,103
NA,to the movement of traffic along the Pacific Highway. There is another 115 kilometres,103
NA,"between Woolgoolga and Ballina still to be commenced, but the design work is advancing on",103
NA,that project. All of this has been possible because the coalition has restored the traditional 80-,103
NA,"20 funding mix for the Pacific Highway, unlike Labor, who were demanding that the state pay",103
NA,50 per cent of the cost-money that they did not have. Under Labor this project would have,103
NA,"taken a decade to complete, or even more, because the state would not have been able to",103
NA,find-,103
Mr Albanese," Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order. In order to be relevant the minister",103
NA,must indicate a single new dollar for a single new project.,103
The SPEAKER, There is no point of order. The member will resume his seat. The,103
NA,Deputy Prime Minister has the call.,103
Mr TRUSS, Five point six billion dollars-that is not $1; that is $5.6 billion! That is,103
NA,money that will deliver the job. It will deliver the construction of this important piece of,103
NA,highway-something that would never have happened if Labor had been returned to,103
NA,government. This is indeed an extraordinary project. It will cut at least 90 minutes off the,103
NA,travel time for heavy transport-even more for lighter vehicles. What it will also do is reduce,103
NA,the road toll on this road-the number of deaths on the Pacific Highway. The work already,103
NA,NA,103
NA,completed has basically halved the number of deaths on the highway. This is an important,104
NA,project and one that the coalition will complete.,104
NA,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,104
NA,The SPEAKER (14:51): I would like to advise the chamber that we have with us today a,104
NA,"delegation from the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, led by Mr Ikram Sayed, a member of",104
NA,parliament. We are delighted to welcome you here and we wish you every success with the,104
NA,future ahead for your democracy building. Welcome.,104
NA,"Honourable members: Hear, hear!",104
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,104
NA,Drought,104
Mr FITZGIBBON ,Hunter) (14:51): My question is to the Prime Minister.,104
Mr Joyce, Oh!,104
Mr FITZGIBBON, I'm after the organ grinder.,104
The SPEAKER, I think the member will withdraw.,104
Mr FITZGIBBON," I withdraw, Madam Speaker. Prime Minister, in February you and",104
NA,"your agriculture minister announced, with much fanfare, that additional drought assistance for",104
NA,"farmers was imminent. Why then, more than three months on, have you and your minister",104
NA,broken that promise to farming communities by failing to deliver not one cent of drought,104
NA,concessional loans to a farming family?,104
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The,104
NA,Nationals) (14:52): It is an absolute honour to get a question from my shadow. Might I say it,104
NA,is going to be an absolute honour to answer it as well. We have already in our first tranche,104
NA,"realigned $420 million of the Farm Finance Concessional Loans Scheme, which they were",104
NA,"unable to get signed off by all of the states. On top of that, we put in $10 million for water",104
NA,"infrastructure. We followed that up with a second drought package of $320 million, of which",104
NA,"$280 million has been signed off by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the finance",104
NA,"minister. QRAA is already able to lend that out, and they are lending it out through the",104
NA,tranches that have been made available to them within the $420 million. We have also made,104
NA,"money available for wild dog control, and we have made money available for water",104
NA,infrastructure-,104
Mr Fitzgibbon," Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Wild dogs are a problem, but",104
NA,how could they be remotely relevant to drought funding? Not one farming family has received,104
NA,a cent. He has-,104
The SPEAKER, The Minister for Agriculture will return to the question.,104
Mr JOYCE," Back on 4 March, we got through the transitional farm family payment, and",104
NA,"over 1,300 people have applied for and received assistance. So there is quite a few dollars in",104
NA,"that, you clown. We are getting these payments out because we are the side that can get the",104
NA,work done. You are the side that talk about it; we are the side that do it.,104

NA,NA,104
NA,"Hinkler. As a former TAFE student, apprentice and tradesperson, and on this National TAFE",104
NA,NA,104
NA,"Day, I ask the Minister for Industry how the government's trade support loans and plans for",105
NA,skills and training will provide opportunities for future students?,105
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (14:54): I thank the member,105
NA,for Hinkler for his question. It is great to see someone who has not only graduated from,105
NA,"TAFE in his electorate but also gone out and had a real job, unlike many on the other side",105
NA,who have basically just been trade union officials. The member for Hinkler has actually done,105
NA,"a trade, gone out there and got his hands dirty and he is now doing an absolutely fine job",105
NA,representing the people of Hinkler. The member said in his maiden speech:,105
NA,"… without the opportunity to learn, you lose your ability to succeed.",105
NA,Mr Husic interjecting-,105
The SPEAKER, The member for Chifley will desist.,105
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE: That is a fine line from someone who knows how important it,105
NA,"is to learn, to get your trade and to get out there and not only secure an income but also be",105
NA,part of the earning economy. We on this side of the House want to make sure that we are,105
NA,"putting out from training institutions people that are job ready, able to contribute and have the",105
NA,"training and the skills that industry needs. As of 1 July, we will be starting our trade support",105
NA,loans which will assist apprentices through the time they are in training.,105
NA,Ms Rishworth interjecting-,105
The SPEAKER, The member for Kingston will desist.,105
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE: This scheme is worth $1.9 billion over the forward estimates,105
NA,"and will assist apprentices. Fourth year apprentices will be able to get up to $20,000. As we",105
NA,"know, these loans are interest free. They will be indexed on 1 June each year and are interest",105
NA,free. These loans will see a 20 per cent discount to apprentices and certain skilled trainees,105
NA,once they graduate. That is what this scheme is all about. It is about assisting people on the,105
NA,way through their training so that they can meet their daily and weekly needs and giving them,105
NA,a bonus and an incentive when they have finished. We want to see these trainees and,105
NA,apprentices not only be supported but also have access to the best training institutions,105
NA,"available. So we support the TAFE system. We support all the RTOs, as long as they provide",105
NA,"a competitive and quality skills training system. We want to make sure that anyone, but young",105
NA,"people particularly, embarking on a trade, like the member for Hinkler did, has the",105
NA,opportunity to get the best possible qualifications. This government will support them every,105
NA,inch of the way with a trade support loan. We will be able to put more into this area once we,105
NA,get over the $1 billion a month we have to pay in interest because of the debt the previous,105
NA,government left us.,105
NA,Pensions and Benefits,105
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (14:58): My question is to the,105
NA,"Prime Minister. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised Australians: no change to",105
NA,pensions. But the Prime Minister has since cut the indexation of pensions and will force,105
NA,Australians to work until 70 years of age-the oldest retirement age in the world. Why did the,105
NA,Prime Minister yesterday make the bizarre claim that there are no broken promises in his,105
NA,rotten budget?,105
The SPEAKER, The Prime Minister will take no notice of the penultimate word.,105
NA,NA,105
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (14:58): There are no changes to pensions in,106
NA,this term of parliament. It is as simple as that. There are no changes to pensions in this term of,106
NA,"parliament. If the Australian people do not like what this government has proposed, they can",106
NA,take the appropriate action at the ballot box at the next election. I will tell you what this,106
NA,government is doing and why this is a budget that is honest and necessary for our country at,106
NA,this time. This government is outlining a clear plan to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster.,106
Mr ABBOTT, We have demonstrated exactly what we propose to do to deal with the,106
NA,mess that Labor created. Now it is up to Labor to demonstrate what it will do to fix up the,106
NA,mess that it created. If Labor thinks that there is something fundamentally wrong about,106
NA,applying to pensions the indexation rate that they applied to the Family Tax Benefit-,106
The SPEAKER, The member for Jagajaga will desist.,106
Mr ABBOTT," If Labor thinks that there is something fundamentally wrong with that,",106
NA,then they should tell us what they are going to do. They should tell us what they are going to,106
NA,"do to fix up the Labor debt and deficit disaster, because, Madam Speaker, it is absolutely",106
NA,"crystal clear, as things stand, that members opposite think there was no problem-",106
The SPEAKER, The member for Sydney will desist.,106
Mr ABBOTT, with debt and deficit and there was no problem with broken promises-,106
The SPEAKER, The member for Lingiari will also desist.,106
Mr ABBOTT," They are living in a fantasy world, that is what they are doing. As the",106
NA,"Treasurer pointed out earlier today in question time, even John Edwards-a long-term Labor",106
NA,"staffer, a long-term friend of the Labor Party and a decent human being, it has to be said, but",106
NA,"someone whom Labor appointed to the Reserve Bank Board-has come out and said,",106
NA,"'Honestly, there is a budget crisis.' John Edwards is right: there is a budget crisis. We accept",106
NA,that; we have put out our plan to deal with it; and it is high time that members opposite woke,106
NA,up to reality and told us exactly what their plan is.,106
NA,Medicare,106
Mr VARVARIS ,Barton) (15:01): My question is to the Minister for Health. What is the,106
NA,government doing to ensure the sustainability and universality of Medicare? Is the minister,106
NA,aware of any alternative policy being proposed?,106
Mr DUTTON ,Dickson-Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (15:01): I thank the,106
NA,"member for his question. People have seen right through question time today, and really since",106
NA,"the budget, that Labor is full of complaint but not solution. We have put forward a solution in",106
NA,"this budget to make sure that Medicare is sustainable. Over the course of the last 10 years, the",106
NA,money that we spend each year on Medicare has gone from $8 billion to $20 billion. We have,106
NA,an ageing population. By 2050 7½ thousand Australians a week will be diagnosed with,106
NA,"dementia or Alzheimer's, and I want to make sure-",106
NA,Ms Plibersek interjecting-,106
The SPEAKER, The member for Sydney will desist.,106
Mr DUTTON, that our health system is designed-,106
NA,Ms Plibersek interjecting-,106
The SPEAKER, The member for Sydney has been warned.,106
NA,NA,106
Mr DUTTON, so that we can take care of those people. I want to make sure that we can,107
NA,listen to the independent advice that was provided to Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister,107
NA,"Gillard, when both those prime ministers commissioned independent reports into the health",107
NA,"system. In both of those reports, Christine Bennett and Simon Keenan came back to Labor",107
NA,and said that the current health system is not sustainable. Bob Hawke knew it was not,107
NA,"sustainable back in 1991, when he introduced the co-payment and we know that for 50 years",107
NA,Labor has supported a co-payment in the medicine scheme to make it sustainable for our,107
NA,population.,107
NA,NA,107
The SPEAKER, The member for Moreton will remove himself under 94 (a).,107
NA,The member for Moreton then left the chamber.,107
Mr DUTTON, We are absolutely determined in this budget to introduce a modest co-,107
NA,payment of $7.,107
The SPEAKER, And those on my right will desist.,107
Mr DUTTON," If people cannot afford the $7, doctors still have the discretion to bulk-bill",107
NA,patients. Patients are bulk-billed by doctors by discretion and from 1 July next year doctors,107
NA,"will have the same discretion to bulk-bill patients. Of the $7, $5 goes into a $20 billion",107
NA,medical research fund so that we can help meet all of those health needs into the coming,107
NA,decades; and the remaining $2 goes back to the doctors. A total of $468 million will help,107
NA,doctors to continue to bulk-bill and it will be in addition to the money that they receive under,107
NA,Medicare now. It is an incredibly important measure to make Medicare sustainable.,107
NA,Labor has not uttered one word about how they intend to listen to the advice that Prime,107
NA,Minister Rudd received to make Medicare sustainable. They are talking about $16 billion,107
NA,more for foreign aid; they are talking about putting more money into the union movement;,107
NA,"they are talking about putting more money into education, health and everything else. But",107
NA,they will not tell Australians how they will pay for it. I noticed overnight in the United,107
NA,"Kingdom, in the Times, a call for patients to pay $10 to see a GP. I think it is a very important",107
NA,discussion. In that discussion they are saying they want to introduce a co-payment because,107
NA,there is a £30 billion gap in the UK's NHS over the course of the next 10 years.,107
NA,"We want to make our system sustainable, and we need to hear from the Labor Party how",107
NA,"they will support, not oppose, that measure. They need to get out of the way.",107
NA,Budget,107
Ms MACKLIN ,Jagajaga) (15:04): My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime,107
NA,Minister aware that at Senate estimates the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs,107
NA,confirmed a saving of $65.1 million in the forward estimates as a result of cutting the pension,107
NA,"of some 280,000 veterans, partners of veterans and war widows? How can the Prime Minister",107
NA,continue to claim that he is not cutting pensions?,107
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Prime Minister) (15:05): Because pensions go up every year.,107
NA,Pensions go up every year-every March and every September pensions go up. Pensions will,107
NA,"go up every single year. It is true that, come September 2017, if this government is re-elected,",107
NA,"there will be a change in the rate of indexation. That is true, but pensions will continue to",107
NA,increase every single year. They will increase every March; they will increase every,107
NA,NA,107
NA,September; they will increase every single year. I say again to the rather noisy member for,108
NA,Jagajaga-the member for Jagajaga who is so honest and truthful that she promised in her,108
NA,2012 budget update that 'we are back in surplus'.,108
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,108
Mr ABBOTT, When are we back in surplus? Not 2012!,108
NA,"Ms Macklin: On a point of order, Madam Speaker. It is on relevance: for this budget and",108
NA,this Prime Minister's cuts to pensions.,108
The SPEAKER, There is no point of order.,108
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,108
The SPEAKER, The member for Lingiari is warned.,108
Mr ABBOTT, There is no year ever when pensions go down. Every year pensions go up.,108
NA,They go up in March every year. They go up in September every year. They go up twice,108
NA,every year. The only difference is that from September 2017 they will be indexed by the same,108
NA,"rate that the member for Jagajaga herself, as minister for family services, thought was fair and",108
NA,"reasonable for the family tax benefit. If it is fair and reasonable for the family tax benefit, if it",108
NA,"is just and moral for the family tax benefit, it is moral for other benefits as well. Not only was",108
NA,the member for Jagajaga being utterly untruthful in her budget update; she is being utterly,108
NA,untruthful now. She should be better than that-she really should be.,108
NA,Australia Post,108
Mr TAYLOR ,Hume) (15:07): My question is to the Minister for Communications. I,108
NA,remind the minister that post offices provide key services to communities in my electorate and,108
NA,in other rural and regional areas. How is the government helping Australia Post to ensure the,108
NA,sustainability of rural and regional licensed post offices?,108
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Minister for Communications) (15:08): I thank the,108
NA,"honourable member for his question and note his very keen interest in this issue. Yesterday,",108
NA,Australia Post launched a rural sustainability package to support its licensed post offices. This,108
NA,is the latest in a series of initiatives that will contribute an additional $40 million a year to,108
NA,"ensure the sustainability of the licensed post office retail network, and that is on top of $320",108
NA,"million paid annually to these licensees. For the first time, an additional 432 licensed post",108
NA,"offices, almost all of whom are in rural and regional Australia, will be provided with access to",108
NA,"Australia Post's electronic point of sale system, and it means they will now be able to deliver",108
NA,and get paid for additional services such as electronic payments and banking services.,108
NA,"There are 2,550 licensed post offices, of which about two-thirds are in rural and regional",108
NA,Australia. They have been doing it tough because the economics of the post office has been,108
NA,"worsening. I want to acknowledge the great work that is being done, sometimes to the",108
NA,"discomfort of Australia Post and, indeed, to the minister of the Senate Environment and",108
NA,"Communications Committee, chaired by Senator John Williams and vigorously encouraged",108
NA,"by Senator Boswell, who is, of course, retiring at the end of this month. The challenges facing",108
NA,Australia Post are very significant. It is a very high-fixed-cost business. The letters business is,108
NA,a very high-fixed-cost business and every year letter volumes are declining. Every time there,108
NA,"is a dollar less spent on letters, it is in excess of an 80c hit to the bottom line of the post office.",108
NA,"As a result, about a billion fewer letters have been sent over the past five years. In the past",108
NA,NA,108
NA,"two years, Australia Post has recorded a combined loss of more than $400 million in its",109
NA,regulated letters business. That trend is going to accelerate. It is expected that letter volumes,109
NA,will decline by about eight per cent each year into the future. Australia Post now forecasts a,109
NA,loss of more than $300 million in its letters business next year. The consequence of that is,109
NA,"that, while it has a profitable retail business and a profitable parcels business, by next",109
NA,financial year it is expecting to record a total company loss because of the losses on letters,109
NA,overwhelming the profits on parcels. There is a widely-held view that the parcels business is,109
NA,growing so fast that it will overtake the losses in letters. That is simply not right. So there are,109
NA,big existential challenges for Australia Post. We are taking them on. We are looking at,109
NA,reform. We are looking at all the options. We are working hard with the management to,109
NA,ensure that it continues to deliver a relevant and sustainable service to all Australians.,109
Mr Abbott, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.,109

Mr HOCKEY ,"North Sydney-The Treasurer) (15:11): Madam Speaker, I seek the",109
NA,indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.,109
The SPEAKER, The minister may proceed.,109
Mr HOCKEY," I was asked a little bit earlier about the words of John Edwards, a Reserve",109
NA,"Bank board member. I quoted the Australian Financial Review from yesterday, in which he",109
NA,said:,109
NA,I've no doubt there is a budget crisis. We're accumulating debt as a higher share of GDP and of,109
NA,"course in absolute terms, [it's] absolutely astronomical compared to far more serious episodes in",109
NA,"Australian history, including recoveries from serious recessions …",109
NA,I should have added this comment referred to him from the article:,109
NA,He says even during the Great Depression we didn't see deficits as a share of GDP of the size we're,109
NA,now experiencing.,109
NA,I table this report because the member for Lilley is in denial. He has never been one for the,109
NA,facts. I table it for his edification.,109

The SPEAKER, Please proceed.,109
Mr ALBANESE, Today in question time the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional,109
NA,Development suggested that I had not provided the funding as minister that was in the budget,109
NA,"for the Pacific Highway. I quote from Mr Mrdak at Senate estimates on Monday, 26 May",109
NA,"2014, who said the following: 'Essentially the Pacific Highway program is continuing as per",109
NA,longstanding arrangements.' In response to a question: 'So there are no new projects. Is that,109

NA,That this House:,111
NA,(1) notes that:,111
NA,(a) shipbuilding is an industry that delivers the highest-value and most complex manufacturing,111
NA,"outcomes produced in Australia, and therefore represents expertise and capacity that must be",111
NA,maintained for its very significant national economic and security benefits;,111
NA,(b) as an example of the multiplier effects of shipbuilding projects in respect of the quality and range,111
NA,"of manufacturing it both requires and enables, at the commencement of the Collins-class submarine",111
NA,"project there were only 35 Australian companies certified to Defence quality standards, whereas by",111
NA,"1998 there were more than 1,500;",111

NA,"in the Royal Australian Navy, and as part of border protection, Antarctic operations and scientific",111
NA,"research, among other roles; and",111
NA,NA,111
NA,(e) if Australian shipbuilding is not supported through a properly planned and managed program of,112
NA,"project and maintenance work, it is likely that shipyards will close, thousands of jobs will be lost, and",112
NA,the critical expertise and capacity that have been developed will be irreparably squandered; and,112
NA,(2) calls on the Government to:,112
NA,(a) provide certainty to the Australian shipbuilding industry and to thousands of Australian workers,112
NA,"by settling a short, medium and long term program of government shipbuilding projects to ensure a",112
NA,balanced work flow and smooth delivery of key naval assets; and,112

NA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,116
NA,Employment,116
NA,The SPEAKER (15:14): I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gorton,116
NA,proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for,116
NA,"discussion, namely:",116
NA,The Government's failure to have a plan for Australian jobs while attacking job seekers and cutting,116
NA,training opportunities for young people.,116
NA,I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their,116
NA,places.,116
NA,More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their,116
NA,places-,116
NA,"Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (15:15): Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.",116
NA,"This is a matter of public importance, and for that reason the opposition wants to have a true",116
NA,debate on the future of jobs in this country.,116
NA,With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to conclude that this government has no interest in,116
NA,"fighting for Australian jobs but, back when the Prime Minister was the opposition leader, it",116
NA,was not so easy. That was a time when the then Leader of the Opposition visited hundreds of,116
NA,"workplaces, using workers as props-as a backdrop to his doorstops-he had his hard hat on,",116
NA,"and he had his high-vis vest and safety glasses, and he claimed he would defend their jobs if",116
NA,"he was ever to be elected prime minister. Well, this proved to be all talk and no action: within",116
NA,"months of the election, this government stood back and watched the collapse of the car",116
NA,"industry. Worse, in this place, we had a treasurer goad Holden to leave this country-and that",116
NA,"is what Holden promptly decided to do. Toyota soon followed. With these two decisions, we",116
NA,will now see thousands of workers-thousands of high-skill jobs-disappear. With the,116
NA,"departure of those iconic companies, tens of thousands of jobs are at grave risk in the",116
NA,"automotive parts industry and beyond. Where is the Prime Minister now, given the amount of",116
NA,NA,116
NA,time he was willing to spend as opposition leader in workplaces around this country? He is,117
NA,"not visiting blue-collar workers in these companies, assuring them that he will fight for their",117
NA,jobs. He is not visiting Holden and Toyota to assure those workers-those soon-to-be-,117
NA,"retrenched workers-that he will find them new jobs. No, the Prime Minister has gone",117
NA,missing in action when it comes to providing opportunities for employment for those workers,117
NA,and other workers in the labour market. The fact is that the Prime Minister has no idea what it,117
NA,will do to those workers and their families when the car industry effectively dies. What,117
NA,arrogance and ignorance was on display by the Prime Minister when he talked about,117
NA,liberating these workers from secure employment-what more shameless approach to,117
NA,industry policy can there be than for a Prime Minister to suggest that the best way forward for,117
NA,"these workers is to lose secure employment and be placed in an unemployed position or, at",117
NA,"best, to find precarious employment in the labour market?",117
NA,It is not just the car industry; the dysfunction of this government was revealed when it,117
NA,"bungled the handling of the future of our national aviation carrier, Qantas. When Qantas",117
NA,"announced 5,000 effective full-time jobs would be cut, the government was all over the place.",117
NA,"When anxious Qantas workers looked to the government to fight to save their jobs, the",117
NA,government could only find time to fight amongst themselves. For months we saw,117
NA,"speculation, leaking, and backgrounding-against each other-about what should happen.",117
NA,"When Qantas tried to work with the government, it was rebuffed by the Prime Minister. One",117
NA,day the Treasurer would outline what Qantas needed to do to secure a debt guarantee-you,117
NA,could read about it on the front page of The Financial Review-and the next day the,117
NA,government would walk away and say it was not possible. What was the result of this,117
NA,"dysfunction, this ineptitude, and this callous disregard for workers? The consequence was",117
NA,"that, under this government, thousands of Qantas jobs will go overseas-that is, pilots, cabin",117
NA,"crew, flight attendants, engineers, maintenance workers and, quite possibly, the chair of the",117
NA,"company, the majority of directors, and even the head office of this iconic Australian flagship",117
NA,"company will go overseas. This government might think that is fine, but Labor knows-as",117
NA,"most Australians know-that once skilled jobs go offshore, they do not come back. Once you",117
NA,"lose skills in your labour market, it is very difficult to replace them. That is why we will fight",117
NA,to keep Qantas Australian and to keep jobs in this country.,117
NA,"Speaking of Qantas and job cuts, there was some devastating news today with the",117
NA,announcement that QantasLink flights into Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory will cease,117
NA,from August. This is a direct result of the closure of the alumina refinery at Gove. Where is,117
NA,the government now? Where is the government's plan to assist Nhulunbuy and north-east,117
NA,"Arnhem Land, a community facing a loss of 1,200 jobs? This will destroy that community. It",117
NA,"happened months ago-and the Prime Minister, who promised to be there in his first week as",117
NA,"Prime Minister, has not turned up for nine months! We will see devastation in that community",117
NA,"as a result, and there has been no response from the government and no response from the",117
NA,Prime Minister. This self-proclaimed Indigenous Prime Minister has turned his back on his,117
NA,promise to return to north-east Arnhem-like he has with so many other promises.,117
NA,"What of other companies announcing more than 100 job losses? Simplot, Electrolux,",117
NA,"Caterpillar, BP, Rio Tinto, Kellogg's, BHP, Arrow Energy, Forge Group, Alcoa, Asciano,",117
NA,"Sensis, Optus, and many, many more. No wonder the government's own department forecast",117
NA,"that there would be 160,000 fewer jobs than the Prime Minister promised before the election.",117
NA,NA,117
NA,But it is not just this government's indifference to jobs and ineptitude; it is not that they do not,118
NA,"have an industry minister-they have an industry minister, but they have no industry policy.",118
NA,This industry minister has not won one debate within the cabinet. The cruelty and the callous,118
NA,"disregard for workers to be found in industry policy, or in the lack thereof, is writ large in the",118
NA,papers of the budget. It can be seen vividly in the cuts to apprenticeships and traineeships that,118
NA,the member for Cunningham will refer to in this debate. What is it about this government that,118
NA,it thinks it can say to the young job seekers of this country 'you need to earn or learn' while it,118
NA,is cutting $1 billion out of apprenticeships and traineeships? What does the government think,118
NA,young people can do when unemployment amongst young people hits more than 13 per cent?,118
NA,How can they find a job to earn when the economy is in that state?,118
NA,"Labor does support the principle of earning or learning, but you have to have jobs with",118
NA,which to earn and you have to have training places in which to learn. Without that investment,118
NA,"and without those job opportunities, it is an absolute disgrace that this government thinks it is",118
NA,okay to cut income for job seekers under the age of 30 for six months. To think that young,118
NA,people will be able to survive for six months without any support whatsoever is ridiculous. It,118
NA,is not only economically ridiculous and absurd; it is socially reprehensible. What we have,118
NA,here is an obligation that has been placed on young people in this country to either earn or,118
NA,"learn, and yet the opportunities will not exist in many parts of this country.",118
NA,"Last week I was in Devonport and Launceston, and in Devonport in northern Tasmania",118
NA,youth unemployment is north of 20 per cent. What does the government expect those young,118
NA,people to do? What we have here is a government that is willing to punish young job seekers,118
NA,"for not finding jobs, and the way they will punish them is to rip away the only support they",118
NA,get from the government while they are looking for work. It just does not make any sense. It,118
NA,"is harsh, it is mean and tricky, and it is going to ensure that we see greater social disharmony.",118
NA,"We are going to see antisocial behaviour, we are going to see an increase in crime, we are",118
NA,going to see an increase in self-harm and we are going to see young people despairing in this,118
NA,country because they have no support whatsoever.,118
NA,What is the most ludicrous part of the government's proposition? I found out last week that,118
NA,even though the government is choosing not to provide any support for these job seekers,118
NA,"under the age of 30 for the first six months, they are going to oblige them to look for 40 jobs a",118
NA,month. There was a time when the principle of mutual obligation did apply-it started under,118
NA,Working Nation under the Keating government and was embraced by the Howard,118
NA,government-and you were provided with a modest level of income while at the same time,118
NA,you were required to look for work. That was continued by subsequent governments. This,118
NA,government is the first in living memory to tear up the compact between government and job,118
NA,seekers. They are tearing up the principle of mutual obligation and are expecting young,118
NA,people under the age of 30 to fend for themselves in a labour market where few opportunities,118
NA,exist in some regions of this country.,118
NA,This government does not get it. The Prime Minister does not get it. They have a lot to,118
NA,"answer for, and they should be looking after young people. (Time expired)",118
Mr HARTSUYKER ,Cowper-Deputy Leader of the House and Assistant Minister for,118
NA,Employment) (15:25): I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public,118
NA,importance concerning jobs and training. What we have heard is 10 minutes of rhetoric from,118
NA,"the member for Gorton and failed immigration minister, the guy who won the silver Logie for",118
NA,NA,118
NA,boat arrivals-not the gold Logie; the member for MCMahon won the gold Logie on failed,119
NA,border protection-and who certainly has no reputation at all with regard to job creation. Let,119
NA,us think about Labor's record in relation to unemployment. On their watch youth,119
NA,"unemployment queues increased by 55,000, on their watch the rate of youth unemployment",119
NA,increased by almost three per cent and on their watch the number of unemployed increased by,119
NA,"200,000. He seems to have suddenly found a solution to the problems of the Australian car",119
NA,"industry, and their solution is endless rhetoric. Let us remind the good member of the past,",119
NA,because he seems to have forgotten that Mitsubishi left Australia on their watch. He was not,119
NA,"able to stop Mitsubishi from leaving. He claims he has all of the answers today, yet",119
NA,"Mitsubishi left. He is looking left, he is looking right, but Mitsubishi left on his watch. Former",119
NA,"Prime Minister Gillard announced funding for Ford-it was going to save Ford, it was going",119
NA,"to create jobs, and what happened? Ford announced it was leaving. Far from being the",119
NA,"champion of people in the workforce, the member opposite is nothing but a failure.",119
NA,"We on this side of the House believe that nothing creates opportunities faster, and nothing",119
NA,"creates more jobs, than a strong economy. The budget that was handed down in this House",119
NA,just weeks ago sets the stage for building jobs into the future. It was a budget that invests for,119
NA,"our future rather than what the opposition did when in government, and that was to spend for",119
NA,today. Ours is a budget that invests in infrastructure; it is a budget that provides incentives,119
NA,and programs to assist people into work. Members opposite face some real challenges as we,119
NA,approach 30 June. They could assist with the repeal of the carbon tax-a $7.6 billion hit on,119
NA,the economy. If the members opposite were serious about having concerns for unemployed,119
NA,"Australians, if the members opposite were serious about creating jobs for young Australians,",119
NA,they would immediately assist the government in the repeal of the carbon tax. What are you,119
NA,"doing? You are sitting there and doing nothing. You are sitting on your hands, when the",119
NA,repeal of the carbon tax will create jobs.,119
NA,Then there is the mining tax. Those opposite are standing in the way of the repeal of the,119
NA,mining tax. Why don't you support the repeal of the mining tax? Why don't you come over,119
NA,this side and vote for it? We believe the best way to create jobs is through a strong economy. I,119
NA,noticed that you mentioned the great state of Tasmania in your contribution.,119
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. BC Scott): Order! The minister might refer his,119
NA,"comments through me, not at me. The use of the word 'you' is a common mistake on both",119
NA,sides of the chamber.,119
Mr HARTSUYKER, The good member mentioned the great state of Tasmania and,119
NA,"unemployment there. There are some great industries in Tasmania, and the dairy industry is in",119
NA,"a state of growth. In north-western Tasmania, an area of high unemployment, we see an",119
NA,"increasing demand for labour, and what do the members opposite do? They insist on imposing",119
NA,"a carbon tax-a carbon tax that increases the cost at the farm gate by around $10,000 a farm;",119
NA,a carbon tax that adds massively to the cost of milk processing. The competitors to the,119
NA,Tasmanian dairy industry are not carrying those taxes. They are not carrying a carbon tax-,119
NA,the world's largest carbon tax. If those opposite were serious about the job prospects for,119
NA,"young Tasmanians, they would come over here and vote with us on the repeal of the carbon",119
NA,tax.,119
NA,The good old member for Franklin has left the chamber. She was not interested enough to,119
NA,stay around. She is the last remaining Labor member for Tasmania. It was not that long ago,119
NA,NA,119
NA,that the member for Franklin would have been joined by four other members. Labor used to,120
NA,"hold five seats in Tasmania, but not any more. There is only one left. She is the last Labor",120
NA,"member standing. With a reputation like theirs on job creation, it is no wonder. It is because",120
NA,of the job-destroying Labor-Greens alliance.,120
NA,We believe that the best way to grow jobs is through a strong economy. We also have a,120
NA,suite of programs to assist in the creation of jobs and to assist job seekers. We have a job,120
NA,"commitment bonus that will provide a $2,500 payment to encourage young people to get and",120
NA,"keep a job, to get into work and stay off welfare for 12 months. If they stay off welfare for a",120
NA,"further 12 months and stay in work-that is two years in total-there is an additional $4,000.",120
NA,"That is a $6,500 incentive to encourage young people to get into work.",120
NA,"We have relocation assistance of up to $6,000 to encourage people to move to a regional",120
NA,"area and $3,000 to move to a metropolitan area. If those job seekers who need assistance to",120
NA,"move have dependents, there is a further $3,000 available. We have the restart program,",120
NA,which is going to encourage employers to put on older workers to enjoy the benefits bringing,120
NA,"workers with a lifetime of experience into the workforce can bring. It is a $10,000 incentive",120
NA,for employers to employ people over the age of 50. It is a very important program.,120
NA,We have the Tasmanian jobs plan. It is an incentive payment for employers in Tasmania to,120
NA,"put on an extra Tasmanian. I would hope that they would take up that program because, as we",120
NA,"know, Tasmania is the state with the highest unemployment in the country. It is a state that",120
NA,"could benefit greatly, as I said, from the growth in the dairy industry. But what do the",120
NA,members opposite do? They insist on retaining the job-destroying carbon tax.,120
NA,"We have a range of measures in the budget in relation to skills and training, including the",120
NA,"$476 million Industry Skills Fund to deliver close to 200,000 targeted training programs over",120
NA,four years. We have trade support loans to encourage young apprentices to get their training.,120
NA,We have expanded opportunities with expanded scholarships for young people from,120
NA,"disadvantaged backgrounds. We have expanded funding to students studying diplomas,",120
NA,advanced diplomas and associate degrees. These are great programs.,120
NA,"Also, more recently, I announced the rollout of phase 1 of our revamped Work for the Dole",120
NA,program. It is a program which has the potential to give young people some of the important,120
NA,basic skills that they need to assist them to get by in the workplace. Many employers have,120
NA,been telling me that young job seekers are presenting at the gates of their businesses without,120
NA,the necessary basic skills to get by in the workplace-simple skills such as turning up on,120
NA,"time, having the right attitude and getting on with their workmates. These are skills that we",120
NA,who have been in the workforce for many years take for granted but unfortunately are sadly,120
NA,lacking for many job seekers.,120
NA,"We have engaged in expanding Work for the Dole, giving young people in 18 selected",120
NA,locations who have been unemployed for 12 months or more the opportunity to participate in,120
NA,"a Work for the Dole program, gain those new skills and have something to take to a future",120
NA,"employer. They can have a reference as to what they have done, what they have achieved and",120
NA,"what they have contributed to their community. As I get around the country, there is",120
NA,widespread acceptance of our revamped Work for the Dole program. Local councils,120
NA,understand the importance of Work for the Dole. Participants understand the importance of,120
NA,"Work for the Dole. So many young people are saying to me, 'Give me a chance to participate.",120
NA,NA,120
NA,Give me a chance to show you what I can do.' I am certain that there will be many young,121
NA,people who will benefit greatly from our enhanced Work for the Dole program.,121
NA,We on this side of the House understand quite clearly that nothing creates jobs faster and,121
NA,more effectively than a strong economy. That is why we introduced the budget recently into,121
NA,this House. It is a budget that sets Australia up for the future. When they see the members,121
NA,"opposite voting again against the repeal of the carbon tax and the repeal of the mining tax, it",121
NA,will be clear to the young people and job seekers of Australia that they are not about getting,121
NA,the settings right. They are not about assisting in the creation of jobs. They are only about,121
NA,standing in the way. We are a government focused on creating opportunities and giving young,121
NA,people assistance into work. They are an opposition that could not manage the budget when,121
NA,they were in government and do not understand the facts of what we need in this country to,121
NA,create jobs. They are simply intent on standing in the way.,121
Ms BIRD ,Cunningham) (15:35): What a valiant effort at wrapping a whole lot of rubbish,121
NA,in a ribbon! Honestly-let's bell the cat here-you cannot drag millions and millions of,121
NA,"dollars out of a particular area, such as skills, and then say, 'Because we have given what is",121
NA,left a new name we have new initiatives.' That is what the government is attempting to do.,121
NA,The reality is that $2 billion for programs in the skills area has been cut. The bit that is left-,121
NA,"the member, for example, talked about the Industry Skills Fund-at half the size of the",121
NA,"original programs that were knocked off to create it is rebadged and renamed and we are told,",121
NA,'Isn't it wonderful? We have a new program.' It is not wonderful. It is not wonderful because,121
NA,what the government has actually done is cut $2 billion out of skills programs and $1 billion,121
NA,out of support for apprentices. It should be held responsible for it. Young apprentices and,121
NA,their families will be holding the government responsible for it.,121
NA,I wanted to take the opportunity to back my colleague's matter of public importance today,121
NA,"because, as we indicated in the parliament-and I acknowledge that the minister",121
NA,acknowledged this-today is National TAFE Day. The point I want to make in this debate,121
NA,about the importance of creating opportunities for both jobs and the training that will go,121
NA,towards achieving those jobs for not just young people but the whole Australian population is,121
NA,that many people may find themselves in life circumstances where they need to retrain. They,121
NA,"might have been out of the workforce, for example, raising a family for a significant amount",121
NA,of time and they need to re-enter the workforce. They might be existing workers in a,121
NA,particular industry sector that has been the topic of much debate-and my colleague raised,121
NA,some of the issues there-where workers need to reskill for future job opportunities.,121
NA,"Investing in the people of this nation is a significant task, yet this government sees it",121
NA,"simply as a cost. That is how they view it. It is a cost and as much as you can cut out of it, you",121
NA,"cut out of it, until it is down to the bone and then you blame the people who fall through the",121
NA,cracks and are not able to get the training and education they need to get into the jobs they,121
NA,need for their own situation. You doubly punish them then by making them wait for six-,121
NA,months before they get income support. That is the reality of what you have done in this,121
NA,budget. That is the reality that will face communities across this nation.,121
NA,The previous member talked about the importance of providing pathways. I would like to,121
NA,"take him to the really disgraceful cut in the apprenticeship sector, that they have made in this",121
NA,"budget, which is to abolish the Apprenticeships Access Program. For example, I visited one",121
NA,of the centres in Parramatta run by the Motor Traders Association where they are working,121
NA,NA,121
NA,with the most disadvantaged young people in that area to give them exactly what the member,122
NA,was talking about-the basic skills in a pre-apprenticeship level course to equip them to get,122
NA,"an apprenticeship. Why is that cut, if the government is as committed as it says it is to",122
NA,providing young people with pathways?,122
NA,Ms Rowland interjecting-,122
Ms BIRD, Yes. The apprenticeships mentoring program provided mature age people as,122
NA,supports for apprentices to assist them to ensure that they can get through to completion-,122
NA,another great program well supported by industries wanting to give young people a chance.,122
NA,"Abolished, completely gone. So if the government is as serious as they claim to be, they have",122
NA,"gone to the very wrong programs in terms of the cuts that they have made and, as a result,",122
NA,"they are leaving young people, their families and their communities in a much more difficult",122
NA,situation.,122
NA,"It is not surprising, because we have had for quite a few years now conservative state",122
NA,governments who have carried out exactly the same sort of agenda with our tremendous,122
NA,TAFE system. TAFE has provided trades and a second-chance education for people across,122
NA,this country for a number of generations now. It is a trusted brand and it should be a trusted,122
NA,"brand, because its priority and its focus have been on providing the skills and opportunities,",122
NA,the re-entry qualifications that people need to engage in further education and work. It is a,122
NA,national asset. It is actually a national strategic advantage that we have had such a fantastic,122
NA,"public education provider in the VET sector. On this day, as on every other day of the year,",122
NA,we should all be committed to challenging those state governments who have been cutting the,122
NA,"heart out of TAFEs and calling them on it, saying to them, 'Reinstate TAFE. Recommit to",122
NA,supporting it and ensure that it has a long and prosperous future in this country.',122
Mr TAYLOR ,Hume) (15:40): It is a great pleasure for me to speak on this all-important,122
NA,"topic of unemployment particularly youth unemployment. It is an issue in my electorate, and I",122
NA,"know in many other rural areas. I will also talk about the related issue of skill shortages,",122
NA,which is a serious issue particularly in the eastern part of my electorate down the Hume,122
NA,Highway.,122
NA,Given the topic of the MPI and given the enormous amount of money that the Labor Party,122
NA,claims to have spent on jobs and skill creation and skill development and the number of,122
NA,"programs that they claim to have put into place, we might have expected that the track record",122
NA,of outcomes would be superb. So I spent a little bit of time looking at their actual track record,122
NA,between the time they got into government in 2007 and the time they left government in 2013,122
NA,to see how they had gone.,122
NA,I thought I would start with youth employment. Take note that between 2004 and 2008,122
NA,"there was 13 per cent growth in youth employment. Between May 2008 and May 2014, with",122
NA,the exception of a small uptick at the end-which we will ignore for now and which I will,122
NA,come back to in a moment-we saw an eight per cent reduction in youth employment across,122
NA,the economy. There was an eight per cent reduction across the time that Labor was in,122
NA,government. Shame!,122
NA,At the same time we can look at youth participation rates in the workforce. It was running,122
NA,"along merrily between 2004 and 2008, rising from about 70 per cent participation up to 71 per",122
NA,cent participation-nice work by the past Howard government. But from early 2008 through,122
NA,NA,122
NA,"to the end of 2013, there was a reduction from 71 per cent to 66 per cent in youth",123
NA,participation-five per cent reduction in participation rates across the time of the last Labor,123
NA,"government. Now they might say, 'That's all right. We were putting them all into training.' But",123
NA,what we also find is that the youth unemployment rate went from nine per cent in January,123
NA,2008 to 12.4 per cent by the end of 2013. What a shameful record of youth employment and,123
NA,youth unemployment we saw from that last Labor government.,123
NA,"And when we dig little deeper, we find some hotspots. In western and north-western",123
NA,Tasmania they managed to achieve a 21 per cent unemployment rate from the Labor-Greens,123
NA,"alliance, destroying jobs in Tasmania. In Cairns, it was 20.5 per cent, in North Adelaide it was",123
NA,"19.7 per cent, and in south-eastern Tasmania it was 19.6 per cent. Well done, Labor-Greens",123
NA,alliance!,123
NA,They crow about the extraordinary work they did on training. Let us have a look at,123
NA,apprenticeships. Between 2007 and 2013 apprenticeship commencements fell by 37 per cent.,123
NA,"No wonder we have got skills shortages in my electorate! By contrast, between 2001 and",123
NA,"2007 under the Howard government, we saw a 33 per cent increase in the numbers of",123
NA,"apprenticeships-all that money, all those programs, and what did you achieve? Absolutely",123
NA,nothing. What a disastrous performance we have seen.,123
NA,So how are we going? We have only had a short while but let us have a look at the facts. In,123
NA,"the last four months the Australian economy has created 100,000 jobs. We hear from the other",123
NA,"side lots of talk about a job loss here, a job loss there, but in total we have created 100,000",123
NA,"jobs. If you calculate that for the next five years, it works out at about 1.5 million jobs against",123
NA,our target of one million that we said before the election. So this is the track record we are,123
NA,already seeing from the coalition government. It is time for you to face the facts and the truth:,123
NA,your performance was absolutely abysmal and it is time for change.,123
NA,Earlier speakers have spoken about the extraordinary range of programs we are putting in,123
NA,"place which are targeted and cost efficient and, I am sure, will deliver the jobs and",123
NA,employment that the young people in my electorate want to see. We are a coalition for jobs.,123
NA,We are a coalition for employment and we are the party of opportunity for young people in,123
NA,stark contrast to those opposite.,123
Mr CHAMPION ,Wakefield) (15:45): This is a government that has got all the emotional,123
NA,"characteristics of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Before the election we had the Prime Minister, then",123
NA,"opposition leader, wandering around the country in fluoro. I remember him chucking ice",123
NA,around. I remember him gutting fish. I remember him visiting Ford in Geelong-all designed,123
NA,around jobs to give people reassurance.,123
NA,What have they done in government? They have instituted policies that are cruel and,123
NA,calculated to divide the Australian community and the economy. They are calculated to,123
NA,entrench disadvantage and accelerate that disadvantage. Perhaps most concerning is that they,123
NA,"are utterly, utterly cavalier about jobs. To that extent you need look no further than my",123
NA,electorate and the treatment that Holden got where we saw the Treasurer of this country,123
NA,chasing Holden out of the country.,123
NA,I will give this to him: he endeavoured to repeat his record in the Howard government,123
NA,"where they offered assistance to the car industry to make sure they stayed here, to make sure",123
NA,"they employed here, to make sure they exported here. He had all of that rhetoric when he",123
NA,NA,123
NA,came down and visited Holden but he lost the cabinet battle and then we had a Treasurer who,124
NA,chased Holden out of the country.,124
NA,"From that, we are seeing a domino effect through car manufacturing to Toyota and the",124
NA,"components sector, and what happens? Fifty thousand jobs. Not a job lost here or there;",124
NA,"50,000 jobs-more than 10,000 in South Australia-lost in areas that can least afford it.",124
NA,"After that performance you would think that they would be a bit reticent but, oh no, in this",124
NA,budget they cut a billion dollars out of the auto industry thus putting more pressure on the,124
NA,"components industry. Anyone who knows the components industry knows that we are very,",124
NA,"very close to seeing an early exodus of the car industry, because of the pressure this",124
NA,government has put on it.,124
NA,What have they got as a panacea to address this employment issue? They have put in place,124
NA,"a $155 million growth fund, which they bragged about, but when I asked the industry minister",124
NA,"specific questions in consideration in detail just today, what kind of response did I get? Just a",124
NA,"diatribe about the Labor Party. No specifics, no thought-out proposals, no projects, no skills",124
NA,"based programs for redundant workers-none of that-just diatribe, just rhetoric.",124
NA,We see that here. We see them wrapping this rubbish up in a ribbon as the member for,124
NA,"Wollongong said-$2 billion worth of cuts in skills and apprenticeships, a billion dollars out",124
NA,"of Tools For Your Trade, and what do we hear? 'Everything's good. Everything's fine. It'll all",124
NA,be right.' The government employ this unbelievable Orwellian language. They think that if,124
NA,"they say it long enough and hard enough, they can defy reality.",124
NA,"What did we see in the budget? We saw a budget that smashed economic confidence,",124
NA,"consumer confidence. You do not need to look too far. ABC on 21 May 2014, Michael",124
NA,"Jander, their business editor-this was the headline: 'Consumer sentiments slump after federal",124
NA,budget announcement'. It drops 6.8 per cent to 92.9-that is solidly below the 100-point level,124
NA,where optimists equal pessimists; 60 per cent of families thought they would be worse off;,124
NA,and just 3.1 percent of people thought they would be better off. That is what they are doing,124
NA,for the retail industry. We have seen what they did for the manufacturing industry and then,124
NA,they are going to slam the retail industry-another big employer of the young.,124
NA,"To top it all off, we see what they are doing to young people: cutting them off the dole after",124
NA,six months and then expecting them to look for 40 jobs a months during that time when they,124
NA,"are not receiving any income. We know what the outcome of that will be: further breaches,",124
NA,"further time without income. That will leave many young people homeless, without income",124
NA,"and without the capacity to get a job. So we have got this assault on jobs, assault on fairness,",124
NA,and this entrenchment of disadvantage and policies that are deliberately set out to make things,124
NA,worse. If those opposite think that they can get away with this anti-Labor rhetoric and,124
NA,"nonsense they put out in this House, they have got another thing coming. These are very, very",124
NA,harsh measures that are designed to hurt Australia. (Time expired),124
NA,"Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (15:50): As usual, we have listened to five minutes of",124
NA,contribution from the other side that is of no relevance to this debate and does nothing for the,124
NA,future direction of this country. Before I delve into the government's positive plans to provide,124
NA,"opportunity for young people, I think it is relevant to revisit and spend some time looking at",124
NA,Labor's past record on employment. It is very illustrative of what we have seen over the past,124
NA,NA,124
NA,six years and the past nine months with the Labor government still completely devoid of ideas,125
NA,and any future direction and sense of what it needs to do for the future of this country.,125
NA,"Nearly 200,000 additional people were unemployed over the past six years, and we can",125
NA,compare that to the Howard government's efforts prior to 2007 where there was a decrease of,125
NA,"nearly 270,000 people in unemployment. When it comes to planning for Australian jobs, it is",125
NA,clear that this government has the policies and plans that will provide successful outcomes for,125
NA,"addressing unemployment. As previous speakers already mentioned, in the last nine months,",125
NA,"we have seen the creation of over 100,000 new jobs in our economy. Under Labor-and their",125
NA,"last couple of speakers were carrying on about various businesses-since 2008, an average of",125
NA,"67 Australian manufacturing jobs were lost every single day. Manufacturing jobs were lost,",125
NA,"roughly, every 19 minutes while Labor was in government. In May 2011 the former",125
NA,"Treasurer, Mr Swan, promised to create 500,000 new jobs in the following two years. Well,",125
NA,"Labor succeeded in missing that target, like it did everything else, by well over 200,000 jobs.",125
NA,"In total Labor's legacy was about 700,000 unemployed Australians, which is the highest",125
NA,"number in 15 years. Suffice to say, with a record like that, it is ironic that the Labor Party",125
NA,"even brings up this topic for debate today. As I said at the outset, they have no plans to do",125
NA,anything for the future.,125
NA,"More importantly, in relation to the topic we are discussing today, we should spend a little",125
NA,"time to focus on those who are currently unemployed, particularly in the youth sector. Our",125
NA,national youth unemployment is currently around 13 per cent. In Logan it is higher at 15 per,125
NA,"cent and on the Gold Coast it is 17 per cent. We, as a government, want to help prevent young",125
NA,people falling into the welfare trap. That is exactly the essence of what we are seeking to do,125
NA,with our positive plans for the future. To address youth unemployment our plan is for young,125
NA,people with work capacity to be either earning or learning. The government are introducing a,125
NA,range of assistance measures to help with training and education costs. We are not giving,125
NA,young people the option to jump into welfare when they leave school. We want to encourage,125
NA,"young people to have fulfilled lives, because we believe that the best kind of welfare is a job.",125
NA,"That is not only because you will earn more than you would on the dole, but it is because it",125
NA,gives young people the necessary skills to succeed in the workplace and to have rewarding,125
NA,careers.,125
NA,"If young people cannot find a job straight out of school, we will have a number of",125
NA,"alternative pathways to find work which includes the $20,000 Trade Support Loans for those",125
NA,undertaking apprenticeships. In discussions I have had with one of our wonderful education,125
NA,"providers, the Australian Industry Trade College,-and we are working with them to open a",125
NA,campus in Beenleigh-I have learnt that they take students in grades 11 and 12 and tailor a,125
NA,school curriculum to line up with the requirements of employers. Ninety-five per cent of the,125
NA,"students that have gone through that particular school have graduated with their QCE, but, far",125
NA,"more importantly, with a job and with an apprenticeship. This funding will help those students",125
NA,pay for their course fees at this particular school.,125
NA,There are options out there. I think it is instructive to note that the Australian Industry,125
NA,Trade College came out of a Howard government program. Nothing those opposite have done,125
NA,for the last six years has assisted this. It is only this government that will provide a future for,125
NA,the young unemployed in our community. (Time expired),125
NA,NA,125
Mr CONROY ,Charlton) (15:55): It is a great MPI to talk on and it is a very important,126
NA,"one, although I disagree slightly with one sentence in the MPI. I think the government does",126
NA,"have a plan for jobs. Unfortunately, it is to destroy them. The member for Wakefield alluded",126
NA,"to this earlier. If you look at the auto industry, before the election the industry said, 'If you cut",126
NA,"assistance to our industry, we have to leave.' What did this government say? 'We know better.",126
NA,We're going to cut $500 million.' Then what happened? Holden leaves and takes Toyota with,126
NA,"them. That is 50,000 direct jobs gone and another 200,000 indirect jobs under threat daily,",126
NA,because this government had a plan and that plan was to destroy jobs.,126
NA,"If you look at what they are doing in naval shipbuilding, they are kissing goodbye to 5,000",126
NA,"high-skilled, nation-building, defence shipbuilding jobs that are vital to our national security.",126
NA,"If you look at SPC, one of the government's own MPs questioned the honesty of the Prime",126
NA,Minister and the Treasurer-quite rightly. As we saw before the election there was not a,126
NA,worker in a high visibility vest that the PM could not get near fast enough. He loved them.,126
NA,"Since the election I have not seen him at a factory, and I have not seen him have the courage",126
NA,"to go to a factory. He has not been to Alcoa, he has not been to Holden, and he has not been to",126
NA,Toyota. He has not had the guts to visit any of them and say why his $500 million cut is,126
NA,ending their industry.,126
NA,Let us look at what the government have done since the election. They have cut the $1,126
NA,billion Aussie jobs plan that would have really helped to diversify the economy. The Prime,126
NA,"Minister claims that he wants to be the infrastructure Prime Minister. Well, how about",126
NA,supporting the Australian Jobs Act which said that with every large project in this country you,126
NA,had to give Aussie companies and their workers a go first? It is now gone. If you look at the,126
NA,"government's $2 billion of cuts to skills and training, that is gone. There are huge attacks on",126
NA,TAFE and huge attacks on Tools For Your Trade which are all gone. The response from the,126
NA,government member is typical of what their attitude is-when in doubt blame the jobseeker;,126
NA,"when in doubt make it harder to get training, make it harder to get Newstart and blame them;",126
NA,when in doubt blame the workers. It is a classic response.,126
NA,I have heard a few statistics quoted from the other side and I have a few as well. For,126
NA,"example, since this government came to power the unemployment queue is longer by 23,000",126
NA,people. That equates to 100 people a day being added to the unemployment queue. The,126
NA,"previous speaker said that, under Labor, unemployment was the highest in over 15 years.",126
NA,"Well, you have already broken that. There are 23,000 additional people on the unemployment",126
NA,"queue. Even more worrying, there are nearly 17 million less hours of work per month in the",126
NA,"market sector. So, those who are lucky enough to have a job are working less. That is a huge",126
NA,impact. Youth unemployment in the eight months the government have been in power in,126
NA,"terms of statistical collection has gone from 12.7 per cent to 13.1 per cent, which is a very",126
NA,significant increase in such a short amount of time.,126
NA,One area I want to touch was the government's great shield. People may remember that,126
NA,before the election they hid behind their little pamphlet 'Our plan-real solutions for all,126
NA,"Australians'. Whenever Mr Abbott got a hard question he just said, 'Don't worry, I've got my",126
NA,pamphlet that provides all the answers.' There was also the six-point plan that some of their,126
NA,candidates in Western Sydney had a bit of trouble with. If I go to the employment section of,126
NA,"the pamphlet, what is the one graph that they choose to highlight? What is the one graph that",126
NA,demonstrates how worried they are about unemployment? It is the long-term unemployed,126
NA,NA,126
NA,where they have a graph that shows the unemployment queue. What has happened since they,127
NA,have come to power? Since they have come to power long-term unemployment in this country,127
NA,"has gone up by 20 per cent in eight short months, that is 30,000 more long-term unemployed",127
NA,people than before they were elected. It is so much that I have had to draw an extra symbol on,127
NA,the graph. It is so out of scale with the graph that they took to the Australian people. This,127
NA,shows that the government are all talk and no action.,127
NA,This is an incredibly important topic. We are talking about the future of Australians. We,127
NA,are talking about the future of young people and trying to give them a chance to have gainful,127
NA,"employment, where they can raise a family and contribute to Australian society. All we get",127
NA,"from the other side is glib slogans, empty three-word slogans. Their actions are cutting $1",127
NA,"billion from the Australian jobs plan, cutting $2 billion from skills and training, cutting other",127
NA,"forms of support, attacking child care and ripping away any support for Australian job",127
NA,seekers. All we get from them is blaming the job seekers-blaming the young people trying to,127
NA,"find work in the member for Wakefield's electorate, the member for Gellibrand's electorate",127
NA,"and my electorate of Charlton. When in doubt, they blame young people and they blame job",127
NA,seekers. It just demonstrates that they are not fit to govern this country.,127
NA,"Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (16:00): When I read today's MPI, I had to seriously question",127
NA,what document those opposite were actually reading. They seem to have picked up the ALP,127
NA,propaganda scare folder. It is quite obvious that they have not even read the coalition policy,127
NA,"documents or, indeed, the budget papers, or are they away in their own parallel universe yet",127
NA,again? The alternate Labor universe is where they pretend that the carbon tax actually reduces,127
NA,greenhouse gas emissions and does not drive up the cost of living. The alternate Labor,127
NA,"universe is where the cost of doing business as a result of the carbon tax and the 20,000 new",127
NA,"pieces of regulation under Labor does not increase and, in fact, it means that small businesses",127
NA,"are forced to cut staff, costing Australian jobs and contributing to the rising unemployment",127
NA,level. The alternate Labor universe is where changing the rules for employment services-,127
NA,"thereby removing the financial incentive to find the unemployed a part-time job, even if they",127
NA,wanted one-does not in fact leave thousands of Australians jobless and the hospitality,127
NA,industry crying out for part-time casual staff. The alternate Labor universe is where those,127
NA,opposite remain blind to these facts: an average of 67 Australian manufacturing jobs were lost,127
NA,each day under Labor since 2008-that is one manufacturing job every 19 minutes on their,127
NA,"watch; and in 2011 the member for Lilley promised, until he was blue in the face, to create",127
NA,"500,000 new jobs over the following two years, when in fact, two years later, Labor missed",127
NA,"that target by more than 200,000 jobs. The alternate Labor universe saw unemployment rise to",127
NA,its highest level in 15 years.,127
NA,"How in this alternate Labor universe does cutting the Australian Defence Force Gap Year,",127
NA,"the ADF's most successful recruiting program, improve training opportunities for young",127
NA,"people? How does repealing the Green Corps program, which provided valuable vocational",127
NA,"education opportunities, help job seekers and training opportunities for young people? How",127
NA,"does abolishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission help job seekers,",127
NA,where malicious strike action with ulterior motives drives up the cost of doing business? The,127
NA,industry has been in decline over recent years due to Labor's policies pandering to the unions.,127
NA,How does suffocating a once-strong industry create employment opportunities and skills,127
NA,NA,127
NA,training for Australians? The answer is simple: it does not. The alternate Labor universe is,128
NA,"some mythical, topsy-turvy world where they live far, far away from reality.",128
NA,The member for Cunningham demonstrated that Labor is still living in this alternate,128
NA,universe when she talked about the government's decision to cease apprenticeship access. If,128
NA,"she wants to talk about job outcomes, the access program was delivering a meagre 26 per cent",128
NA,job outcome under her watch despite spending more than $100 million on this program every,128
NA,"year. We are about target outcome focused programs. Thankfully, on this side of the House",128
NA,we do not live in a state of chronic psychosis and blissful ignorance. No-on this side we are,128
NA,"well and truly aware of the cold, hard facts about the state of unemployment and education",128
NA,"left behind by the previous, Labor government. That is why we are determined to repeal the",128
NA,"carbon tax and reduce the burden of red and green tape on individuals, businesses and",128
NA,"organisations. That is why the coalition is deregulating universities, which will see",128
NA,"opportunities for 80,000 additional places in sub-bachelor degrees such a diplomas, advanced",128
NA,diplomas and associate degrees. Commonwealth funding has been expanded to support people,128
NA,studying these courses. The coalition government has expanded Commonwealth funding for,128
NA,"bachelor degrees to all registered higher education institutions, not just universities.",128
NA,"We have introduced the largest ever Commonwealth Scholarships Program, creating more",128
NA,opportunities for students with low socioeconomic backgrounds from regional areas to enter,128
NA,"tertiary study. Apprentices will now be eligible for Trade Support Loans, helping with the",128
NA,cost of their training and the purchasing of the tools for their trade. Streamlining of the,128
NA,"Industry Skills Fund and a commitment of $476 million will see 200,000 targeted training",128
NA,places over four years in areas of need. The coalition is boosting the number of older workers,128
NA,participating in the workforce through the Restart initiative. Businesses will receive up to,128
NA,"$10,000 for employing workers older than 50.",128
NA,These are just some of the initiatives the coalition government is taking to improve,128
NA,opportunities for job seekers and training opportunities for young Australians. We have a,128
NA,"proud history on this side of the House of improving the job market, allowing businesses to",128
NA,"do what they do best, boosting employment and seeing the next generation trained and",128
NA,educated to strive in an increasingly competitive market. It is time that Labor stopped their,128
NA,delusions of false accomplishment and let the coalition government get on with the job.,128
NA,NA,128
NA,those opposite-not from within the chamber but in my office. I would like to commend the,128
NA,"member for Ryan for one thing, and that is the maroon scarf around her neck. However, I",128
NA,condemn her and the people that she is sitting with for the heavy burden they have sadly put,128
NA,around the necks of young Australians. We were led to believe before the election that the,128
NA,"Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, would fight for Australian jobs. He has a record",128
NA,"of being a fighter, a boxer, but, sadly, we have seen so many jobs go offshore-jobs that will",128
NA,"never come back-particularly in manufacturing, when he said that Australia would always",128
NA,have a manufacturing sector. He has neglected it on his watch.,128
NA,"In fact, my opponent, the member for Warringah's candidate, promised an LNP",128
NA,commitment that there would be a jobs forum in the electorate of Moreton within 100 days of,128
NA,"gaining office. Nearly 300 days in and there is still no jobs forum, despite me writing to two",128
NA,"ministers about it and asking them to keep their word. On the south side of Brisbane, most of",128
NA,"the electorate of Moreton has a youth unemployment rate nudging 15 per cent. Sadly, we are",128
NA,NA,128
NA,also seeing cuts in the TAFE sector in Queensland. John-Paul Langbroek is committed to,129
NA,"closing one in three TAFEs-it is a horrible fact to acknowledge on National TAFE Day, but",129
NA,that is the reality facing Queenslanders. As we have heard from other speakers from other,129
NA,"states around this nation, they have all been impacted-and they will be impacted further by",129
NA,the short-sighted decision to cut $2 billion from schools and training programs.,129
NA,We have a government that is happy to commit to that Queensland government policy of,129
NA,"10 years ago of 'earning or learning', yet they are ripping money away from programs that",129
NA,actually provide support to young people in apprenticeships and to help them get into,129
NA,employment and education. We should be responding to the issue of youth unemployment by,129
NA,"investing in young people, not cutting them off when they most need help.",129
NA,"On National TAFE Day I acknowledge that, over the last 40 years, TAFE has emerged as",129
NA,"one of the top vocational education systems in the world, as the traditional master and",129
NA,apprenticeship scheme has changed and evolved to reflect the modern world. So why does,129
NA,Queensland state government policy not recognise TAFEs achievements-its contribution to,129
NA,our society and the incredible skills of the teachers who work there? Instead they have,129
NA,decided to savagely cut investment in TAFEs.,129
NA,Last year the Newman Queensland government announced details of reforms which will,129
NA,"make all public funding contestable. It will remove all assets from TAFE Queensland,",129
NA,"introduce HECS student loans to make students pay even more for training, and restrict access",129
NA,"to places at TAFE for many students. In fact, the recent Queensland budget announced that",129
NA,campuses will be opened up for use by for-profit providers and 38 TAFE colleges look likely,129
NA,to close.,129
NA,We need more skilled workers. We have employers calling out to people from around the,129
NA,world to come over on 457 visas because they cannot find enough skilled workers in,129
NA,"Queensland and other parts of Australia. We need more plumbers, more electricians, more",129
NA,"carpenters and more fitters and turners. The Labor government helped 21,000 Australians",129
NA,"access an apprenticeship through the Kickstart initiative. Thanks to Labor, senior high school",129
NA,"students across Australia have better access to trade training centres. However, we have also",129
NA,seen TAFE fees soaring in many places. It has disastrous consequences when these fees go,129
NA,"up, particularly for poorer families-and especially when someone is the first person in their",129
NA,family to go on to higher learning.,129
NA,"In Queensland we have seen a crazy situation where some fees have now increased tenfold,",129
NA,"or 1,000 per cent, which is way beyond the reach of ordinary working people. For example, a",129
NA,"Diploma of Sustainability course in Cairns went up from $439 in 2013 to more than $6,000",129
NA,"this year. This information is from Curtis Pitt, the state member for Mulgrave. Her son's",129
NA,"ambition is to work in film and television and the fee for that course rose from $3,000 in one",129
NA,"year to more than $20,000. Those fees make such courses out of the reach of ordinary",129
NA,"Australians, particularly poorer Australians. Despite the empty words of those opposite, we",129
NA,are not seeing an improvement in long-term unemployment or in opportunities for young,129
NA,people.,129
NA,Mrs SUDMALIS (Gilmore) (16:10): This government stands for employment solutions to,129
NA,"work, not for employment dissolution to welfare. Gilmore's unemployment rate was the fifth",129
NA,"highest in Australia, at 9.3 per cent, when Labor left government last year. Those opposite cry",129
NA,crocodile tears over budgetary reallocations. The redirection of taxpayer dollars is an obvious,129
NA,NA,129
NA,"result of the failed program measures of the last Labor government, when an extra 200,000",130
NA,people were looking for work. Those opposite should be ashamed. Our current unemployment,130
NA,"is the legacy of six years of Labor government that promoted handouts, bonuses and carbon",130
NA,"tax compensation without any sense of a return from the recipients, with no proper audit and",130
NA,certainly with no measure of delivery outcomes.,130
NA,Those opposite have absolutely no idea. To condemn a young unemployed person to a life,130
NA,"of welfare dependence is the very pathway to a lack of self-esteem, progressing to social",130
NA,"isolation, depression and possibly antisocial behaviour. The plan to encourage re-engagement",130
NA,through volunteering is a proven method of revitalising people and growing their self-,130
NA,confidence.,130
NA,This government is getting on with the job of repairing the cracks that the Australian Labor,130
NA,"party left in our economy. We are getting on with the job of restoring business confidence,",130
NA,creating one million new jobs and getting the budget into black. It is those on this side of the,130
NA,"House who truly care about employment and Australia's future prosperity, rather than welfare",130
NA,horizons as far as the eye can see.,130
NA,Gilmore is one of just 18 trial sites for the government's revamped and revitalised Work for,130
NA,"the Dole scheme. During the next few months, over 800 local job seekers will have the",130
NA,"opportunity to learn new skills, get work ready and contribute back to the community that has",130
NA,"helped them get on their feet. With over 6,000 unemployed in my electorate, I am focused on",130
NA,bringing new opportunities and better skills to our people.,130
NA,"The government's 20,000 Trade Support Loans will help restore the prestige of an",130
NA,apprenticeship and help our local youth in Gilmore get through the tough years that a trade,130
NA,"apprenticeship brings. These loans will allow apprentices to buy tools or a vehicle, or to",130
NA,simply keep their head above water. Our scheme offers incentives for apprentices to complete,130
NA,"their training with a $4,000 discount on their loan when they complete their apprenticeship.",130
NA,"This actually supports TAFE education-which, by the way, is predominantly funded by the",130
NA,state government.,130
NA,"After all, why should a plumber, an electrician, a builder, a baker or any other kind of",130
NA,tradesperson be treated any differently to a university graduate? Without a builder to construct,130
NA,"our homes, our offices and our city infrastructure, we would not have universities in the first",130
NA,"place. In many towns across Australia, especially in rural and regional Australia, the highest",130
NA,"income earners you will find are the builders, the miners, the plumbers and the bakers-as it",130
NA,should be. It is time to restore the prestige of an apprenticeship and that is just one thing this,130
NA,"government is doing to get Australia, and our unemployment rate, back on track. Labor's so-",130
NA,called support for manufacturing and workers has to be questioned when associated jobs were,130
NA,lost at a rate of 67 a day. That equals one job lost every 19 minutes; what a disgrace.,130
NA,Industries like the Shoalhaven Paper Mill or the Port Kembla steelworks used to employ tens,130
NA,of thousands of people between them under the last coalition government. Since Labor's,130
NA,"election in 2007, we are now lucky to see that total more than 1,000.",130
NA,"We are also investing in older Australians with our $10,000 Restart grant for businesses",130
NA,who employ workers over 50. This is a strong incentive to employ some of our wisest and,130
NA,greatest assets in the Australian workforce. The electorate of Gilmore has one of the highest,130
NA,"numbers of these wise residents in the entire country. We have over 20,000 age pensioners",130
NA,"who make up a strong, experienced and mature workforce and we are proud of that fact. This",130
NA,NA,130
NA,"initiative will be part of our efforts to reduce our chronic local unemployment, as well as the",131
NA,"Green Army project, which is an amazing initiative. This government is in the business of",131
NA,creating a strong economy and keeping jobs for Australians. I am in the business of fixing,131
NA,Gilmore's unemployment rate.,131
NA,There have been many occasions in the last 12 months where I have spoken in passionate,131
NA,terms about the devastating effect of the Labor Party's carbon tax on regional employment.,131
NA,"Those opposite have no concept that for a small, local, family owned business the huge",131
NA,increase in electricity cost causes them to think twice about employing young people for part-,131
NA,time employment. They simply cannot afford it. It was easier to just do it themselves so they,131
NA,"could stay ahead financially, and so employment for young people chronically dropped. I was",131
NA,in business for almost 20 years. I know full well how important work experience and work,131
NA,confidence is for a new employee. Having employed more than about 150 people in a period,131
NA,"of 20 years, I know exactly what skills they need. We do not do young people any favours by",131
NA,"not encouraging them to start volunteering or to get their initial work experience. Ultimately,",131
NA,the efforts of these initiatives and the efforts of this government will lead to a much greater,131
NA,potential for growing paid employment for every unemployed person.,131

NA,Second Reading,131
NA,Cognate debate.,131
NA,Debate resumed on the motion:,131
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,131
Mr VARVARIS ,Barton) (16:17): I am very pleased to be speaking on the Asset,131
NA,Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill,131
NA,2014 today. This initiative is a bold and necessary component of Australia's infrastructure,131
NA,"future. The bills propose that the government can sell public assets, such as Medibank, with",131
NA,NA,131
NA,the resulting proceeds going towards much needed infrastructure investment projects. The,132
NA,Asset Recycling Fund is scheduled for commencement on 1 July this year. The coalition is,132
NA,proud to be the government that is actively responding to our infrastructure crisis. The last six,132
NA,years have seen infrastructure growth all over Australia stagnate under procrastination and,132
NA,"delay. The coalition, under our two infrastructure leaders, the Prime Minister and the Minister",132
NA,"for Infrastructure and Regional Development, is making an historic investment in the budget",132
NA,this year to get on with building Australia's infrastructure.,132
NA,"For too long, our infrastructure needs have not kept up with population growth. This has",132
NA,"detrimental effects for Australia as a competitive international player, for economic certainty",132
NA,and for the lives of fellow Australians. Congestion on roads bearing the heavy burden of,132
NA,"traffic is costing our economy $15 billion a year, and weak productivity growth from a range",132
NA,of factors is threatening the stability of our future living standards. Infrastructure development,132
NA,and implementation is top priority for this government. Years of procrastination and delay,132
NA,threaten current and future economic prosperity. The undeniable truth is that we must act,132
NA,now. We have to break the complacency that was paralysing our infrastructure growth and,132
NA,"resolve the infrastructure backlog. The coalition is getting on with the job, as per our election",132
NA,"promise, of building the roads of the 21st century by committing to existing projects. We will",132
NA,not be wasting further time and funds on consultation and analysis while not actually rolling,132
NA,anything out.,132
NA,"I think what Macquarie Group Executive Director, Jim Miller, said previously really homes",132
NA,in on this point:,132
NA,We have this inertia where everyone is pointing to each other. The Commonwealth is pointing to the,132
NA,States; the States are pointing to the Commonwealth. Meanwhile we haven't achieved anything.,132
NA,This is the differentiating factor between members on this side of the chamber and those,132
NA,opposite. Instead of leaving such important decisions solely to other parties to figure out how,132
NA,"to get the project going, the coalition's budget figures constitute a historic infrastructure",132
NA,investment and prove that we have listened to stakeholders and gotten stuck into the job of,132
NA,building the roads and transport of the 21st century within just eight months of being in,132
NA,government. The critics might say the coalition is merely committing to existing projects by,132
NA,"the Labor government. But, ultimately, there is a big difference between commitment and",132
NA,action. The coalition is about action and getting the job done.,132
NA,I note from the recent Infrastructure Australia report that urgent reforms are needed to,132
NA,"address our growing population in all areas of Australia. Sir Rod Eddington, Chairman of",132
NA,"Infrastructure Australia, said:",132
NA,Focusing on the right reforms will help us to use existing infrastructure more efficiently … and involve,132
NA,private players more in the ownership and management of traditionally publicly owned assets by,132
NA,"recycling capital to fund new infrastructure … These reforms, however challenging, will leave",132
NA,"Australians better off-with more capable Governments, better planned infrastructure that meets their",132
NA,"needs, and more sustainable, affordable transport options.",132
NA,The good news for Sir Rod and for Australians across the nation is that a core element of the,132
NA,government's Economic Action Strategy is the commitment of an additional $11.6 billion in,132
NA,the budget for the Infrastructure Growth Package. I also wish to refer to the draft report of the,132
NA,Productivity Commission produced in March of this year which notes:,132
NA,NA,132
NA,Efficient public infrastructure plays a key role in a competitive and productive economy and the,133
NA,ongoing funding and financing of infrastructure development in Australia is therefore of critical,133
NA,importance.,133
NA,I proudly support the $5 billion contained in the budget to establish the Asset Recycling,133
NA,"Initiative, which will provide incentive payments to states and territories that sell assets so",133
NA,that proceeds can be reinvested to fund essential infrastructure right around Australia. This is,133
NA,a win-win scenario. This record level of investment in infrastructure by a Commonwealth,133
NA,"government reflects our resolve to get things done, because that is what we were elected to",133
NA,do. Delaying infrastructure is harmful to the national interest and will ultimately impede long-,133
NA,term economic prosperity.,133
NA,"In my electorate of Barton, residents are already benefiting from the actions of an effective",133
NA,"government. Through smart investing and modes of financing, stage 2 of WestConnex is set",133
NA,"to begin early next year, with the Commonwealth and state governments working together.",133
NA,This is an $11 billion project that will greatly benefit the constituents and motorists in my,133
NA,electorate. The project received a $1.5 billion commitment from the coalition to the state of,133
NA,New South Wales and a further $2 billion as a concessional loan to accelerate the delivery of,133
NA,stage 2 by up to 18 months. This innovative reform of finance is the type of creative financial,133
NA,"solution we have needed for a long time, and it has taken a coalition government to deliver it.",133
NA,The WestConnex is one of the largest transport infrastructure projects in Australia. The,133
NA,project will deliver 33 kilometres of new and upgraded motorways linking Western and,133
NA,"South-western Sydney with the city, Sydney Airport and port precincts. It will remove traffic",133
NA,"in that motorists can bypass busy CBD streets and go underground. An estimated 3,000 trucks",133
NA,use these existing roads daily and this development will mean their travel times will be,133
NA,reduced and the traffic burden placed on local roads will ease.,133
NA,"Beyond addressing motorist needs, the WestConnex will deliver more than $20 billion",133
NA,"dollars in economic benefits to New South Wales with a further 10,000 jobs created during",133
NA,the construction period. This is an outstanding testimonial to what an efficient infrastructure,133
NA,government can achieve. Projects like these can continue to operate right around the nation,133
NA,with the onset of the Asset Recycling Fund.,133
NA,Initiatives like these are essential to reducing infrastructure construction costs and address,133
NA,any barriers to private sector financing. The last six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd,133
NA,government have seen our infrastructure stagnate with high congestion on local roads. The,133
NA,Productivity Commission's draft report on public infrastructure highlighted poor project,133
NA,selection and poor planning as some of the major constraints on Australians receiving the,133
NA,"infrastructure they need, and that is very disappointing. If we are to prosper and create",133
NA,"economic certainty for all Australians now and into the future, we must get on with delivering",133
NA,"the roads, ports and means of transport for all Australians immediately.",133
NA,The budget constraints now and into the future mean we are facing infrastructure deficits,133
NA,"exacerbated further by the previous five record deficits under the Labor government. Further,",133
NA,we have layers of bureaucracy that stifle infrastructure growth and development-for,133
NA,"example, nearly 600 different local, state and territory governments along with",133
NA,Commonwealth government and infrastructure departments. This is creating inefficient and,133
NA,"slow development from ideas to reality, meaning our projects take a long time to get off the",133
NA,ground and therefore become unattractive to potential investors.,133
NA,NA,133
NA,The coalition is committed to working constructively with state counterparts to address,134
NA,needs and move projects forward in a timely fashion. The Asset Recycling Fund will tap into,134
NA,potential private investor funding to alleviate the burden on traditional government revenue.,134
NA,"Members of the opposition are against user-pay models, but infrastructure can only be funded",134
NA,"through either increases in tax, increases in borrowings or user charges. Because of the large",134
NA,"debt and deficit we are in and the tax revenue languishing from changes to demographics,",134
NA,asset recycling is a viable and necessary option to address our chronic infrastructure shortage.,134
NA,"Unless a government is innovative and prepared to confront the challenges that lie ahead,",134
NA,Australia will continue to face a chronic undersupply of infrastructure. Everyone has to,134
NA,contribute to these investments because there simply is not a surplus of money.,134
NA,"The coalition fully recognises this, and we are committed to tackling these challenges head",134
NA,on. Members of the opposition may counter by saying these are all the things they have done,134
NA,"whilst they were governing. Unfortunately, their track record speaks otherwise. As mentioned",134
NA,"earlier, the WestConnex project is not new, and Labor had the chance for years to do right by",134
NA,the people of Barton and New South Wales. But it never kicked it off.,134
NA,"Further west of the WestConnex, the Parramatta-Epping rail link was delayed by seven",134
NA,years until a coalition government came into power. Another infrastructure fiasco was the,134
NA,"National Broadband Network, costing in the billions and still not having reached their",134
NA,targeted numbers well and truly after the initial rollout phase. Any government that spends the,134
NA,hard-earned dollars of taxpayers is accountable for the outcomes of their investment. These,134
NA,projects should ultimately enhance the lives of constituents and respond to their needs.,134
NA,To further highlight the enormity of support for this bill-which should illustrate the dire,134
NA,straits we were left in with regard to infrastructure-states and territories all signed the,134
NA,National Partnership Agreement on Asset Recycling at the Council of Australian,134
NA,Governments meeting on 2 May this year. This signed agreement with state and territory,134
NA,counterparts means that for every dollar of government investment it will harness a return of,134
NA,$8 for infrastructure revenue. The Asset Recycling Initiative will leverage close to $40 billion,134
NA,of new infrastructure investment from the states and territories.,134
NA,This unanimous support for the agreement demonstrates that state and federal levels of,134
NA,"government can work together. Ultimately, the real outcomes of the coalition's record",134
NA,"spending on infrastructure investment aside from roads, rail and urban transport is that people",134
NA,benefit by having more time back in their personal lives. We must not forget that initiatives,134
NA,like an asset recycling fund which goes on to fund important road projects and improve,134
NA,logistics has a very real benefit in terms of human value for all Australians. Less time spent,134
NA,on congested roads means more time at home and with family. Fewer heavy vehicles in the,134
NA,"CBD means urban transport can get from A to B faster, carrying passengers who spend less",134
NA,time stuck in traffic and more time doing the things they enjoy. Weekends can be freed up for,134
NA,personal time as opposed to waiting in traffic.,134
NA,The big winners of the coalition's infrastructure spend and Asset Recycling Initiative are,134
NA,the people and families that make up our society. Giving time back to people and families,134
NA,"who are already time poor is important, and this will be achieved with the coalition's growth",134
NA,package. I commend the bill to the House.,134
Ms CHESTERS ,Bendigo) (16:28): In rising to speak to this bill I want for a moment to,134
NA,pay credit to the government for their creative writing skills and the name of the Asset,134
NA,NA,134
NA,Recycling Fund Bill 2014. How do they come up with this stuff? Operation Sovereign,135
NA,"Borders, Enhancement Removal Program for Regional Post Boxes, Asset Recycling-do they",135
NA,sit around? Is there a whiteboard? Is there a competition amongst the backbenchers? How do,135
NA,"they come up with this stuff? At the end of the day, asset recycling is purely and simply",135
NA,privatisation. It is the sale of public assets so private enterprise can make a profit from them.,135
NA,It is not anything new; it is straight out of the modern Liberal playbook.,135
NA,"In short, this bill intends to provide an incentive for state governments to privatise their",135
NA,"assets and then recycle the proceeds into new infrastructure projects. As I said, this is not",135
NA,new; this is what Liberals and Nationals do when they get elected. They sack public servants,135
NA,and sell off public assets as quick as they can. It is a throwback for many Victorians to the era,135
NA,"of Jeff Kennett. In office, Jeff Kennett immediately instituted budget cutting measures and a",135
NA,"privatisation program. In fact, Jeff sacked over 50,000 public servants. In his first three years",135
NA,"of office, he closed 350 government schools, cut 7,000 teaching jobs and sacked thousands of",135
NA,school cleaners on Christmas Eve. Kennett also sold off billions of dollars worth of Victorian,135
NA,"public assets. And he did this, he claimed, because of a budget emergency-again, language",135
NA,straight out of the Liberal Party handbook that we hear again today in this chamber. Kennett,135
NA,"privatised state owned services, including electricity and gas utilities, the ambulance service",135
NA,and prisons as well as other services. The sale of gas and electricity raised $29 billion when it,135
NA,was sold to private enterprise.,135
NA,"Whilst nobody disagrees that in the short term this money did go into the budget, the",135
NA,longer-term economic cost to the people of Victoria still raises questions about whether this,135
NA,sale was worth it. Putting electricity generation and distribution into private hands neither,135
NA,"reduced the price of electricity nor helped the broader public interest. Since privatisation,",135
NA,electricity prices to the consumer have gone up by 50 per cent-and to think that members,135
NA,opposite are upset about the price on carbon. Where is the critique of the cost of privatisation?,135
NA,"Who led the revolt against Kennett, and who is leading the revolt against this government, but",135
NA,people in regional communities? Regional communities were the first to vote Kennett out.,135
NA,They were the first to stand up and say that they did not support the sale of public assets. They,135
NA,did not believe that they would get good services in the bush if public assets are privatised.,135
NA,And I share their fears. That is why I support the amendments moved by Labor in the,135
NA,House and in the Senate that will require as a precondition for the spending of,135
NA,Commonwealth funds on the asset recycling initiative (a) an Infrastructure Australia,135
NA,assessment of the new infrastructure that includes a published cost-benefit analysis and (b) the,135
NA,tabling of a disallowable instrument for each privatisation or reinvestment transaction. It is,135
NA,important for our communities that we ensure that there is strong oversight when it comes to,135
NA,"the sale of our public assets. Regional Australians fear the fire sale of public assets, because",135
NA,where is their representation? Where are the Nationals on this? In opposition they are quite,135
NA,"happy to say, 'We'll stand up for the bush', but the moment they get elected into government",135
NA,they crumble to the city based Liberals when it comes to public assets. They flounder and,135
NA,agree with silly terms such as 'asset recycling' and agree with the Liberals in their agenda to,135
NA,sell off assets. I call on the members who represent regional communities to stand up and to,135
NA,"support Labor's amendments, because these amendments are the only ones that will truly",135
NA,ensure that people in the country will be represented when it comes to their public assets. If,135
NA,NA,135
NA,the states seek to gain from the sale of public assets or the assets recycling program it should,136
NA,be subject to the measures as outlined in Labor's amendment.,136
NA,In the state of Victoria there are not many assets left after Kennett's big privatisation bender,136
NA,of the early 90s. But there is one: there is still the Port of Melbourne. And on that particular,136
NA,"one, only a week ago Jeff Kennett actually argued that the state government should proceed",136
NA,"immediately to sale and that not selling it was 'politically dead'. Well, politically dead is not a",136
NA,good enough reason for the sale of a public asset and is another reminder of why it is so,136
NA,important that we have oversight when it comes to the sale of our public assets. Whilst the,136
NA,"port remains one of the last significant public assets on the Victorian books, it is important to",136
NA,"note that the Victorian government has made noises publicly about this program, and in this",136
NA,House we have not forgotten it. They are so concerned about this particular program that they,136
NA,have actually made a submission to the Productivity Commission. The Victorian government,136
NA,is so worried that Victoria could be disadvantaged under the plan because so many public,136
NA,assets were sold off in the 1990s that in their submission Victoria argued that the privatisation,136
NA,push of the Kennett years has left the state with less scope to benefit from this measure. They,136
NA,argue that any such incentive payments must also provide financial rewards for past efforts in,136
NA,selling off public assets. Is this state government for real? Once you have sold them off they,136
NA,are gone. What do they not understand about how the market works? Yet they are arguing that,136
NA,they should be rewarded for their past efforts.,136
NA,These comments are not surprising from a government that is becoming increasingly,136
NA,chaotic and increasingly dysfunctional. Just to touch very quickly on an example of how,136
NA,"dysfunctional this government has become in my area of Bendigo, it appears that if you want",136
NA,to get funding right now from this government all you have to do is ring up the local paper-a,136
NA,"very good paper, the Bendigo Advertiser-and if they run a front-page story about your",136
NA,particular issue then within days you will get a visit from the Premier and a visit from the,136
NA,education minister promising funding. That is exactly what we saw happen to the Kalianna,136
NA,Special School this week and exactly what we saw happen to the Annie North project. And,136
NA,good on them for speaking out about the lack of investment from the Liberal government in,136
NA,the state of Victoria. But it is a bad way to do policy if local schools and local organisations,136
NA,"have to be on the front page of their local paper to get funding. The secret is out now, and",136
NA,watch every front page of the Bendigo Advertiser and watch the state government throw,136
NA,money desperately trying to win the next state election. It is another reason that it is so,136
NA,important that these amendments are adopted. These decisions about infrastructure should be,136
NA,independently assessed and recommended by Infrastructure Australia.,136
NA,"We all know that the Liberals are obsessed with Melbourne metro based transport projects,",136
NA,leaving electorates like my electorate out in the cold when it comes to decent infrastructure,136
NA,"funding. We have our own fair share of projects-regional infrastructure projects, roads",136
NA,projects and rail projects that we also need funding for. Yet the Libs and the Nats in the state,136
NA,"of Victoria continue to champion a dud tunnel, the east-west tunnel, with little precious",136
NA,funding left available for vital regional infrastructure and rail projects. This one project,136
NA,demonstrates why it is so important that Infrastructure Australia should be involved in the,136
NA,approval of any major projects. This is one project that we have heard of today in this House,136
NA,and that we have seen reported in the media that lacks the transparency around the decision,136
NA,making that is required for major infrastructure projects.,136
NA,NA,136
NA,"Instead of allocating the $8 billion in funds to our regional highways, arterial roads and",137
NA,"local roads that are falling apart and riddled with dangerous cracks and potholes, the money",137
NA,has been allocated to what has been described as a dud tunnel. The tunnel does not solve the,137
NA,congestion problems of Melbourne. There are very few people in Melbourne who need to go,137
NA,from east to west. People in the east and the west need to go to the city.,137
NA,"There is no design yet, or even a mark on the map, showing where this tunnel will pop out.",137
NA,"Why? Because we have a state election, and who wants to be the sitting MP who has to go",137
NA,"around door knocking saying, 'My government has decided to knock down your house so that",137
NA,the tunnel can pop out in your backyard.' This is the problem with policy decisions that are,137
NA,"made on a whim, and it is another reminder about why we have established Infrastructure",137
NA,Australia and why these decisions should be independently assessed by Infrastructure,137
NA,Australia.,137
NA,After the last election the Prime Minister was reported in The Age as saying that he did not,137
NA,even need to see the business case for the East West Link. The journalist went on to report in,137
NA,The Age that over $1.5 billion in funds would go to this tunnel without the Prime Minister,137
NA,even seeing the full business case. How is that a good way to do good governance and ensure,137
NA,that taxpayers are getting value for money?,137
NA,The government is making this advance payment to the state of Victoria to help fast-track,137
NA,the project and make their budget look good before the next state election. Is that how,137
NA,desperate the Liberals have become to prop up a dysfunctional and chaotic state government.,137
NA,"If there were one example that demonstrated that there is a need for greater transparency, it",137
NA,would be the East West Link project of Melbourne. There are so many major regional,137
NA,"infrastructure projects that need urgent attention, and not just to help families get from A to B",137
NA,but also to help our products get from the north of the state to the ports. The Mildura freight,137
NA,rail project is one that comes to mind. Other projects are the Calder Highway upgrade to the,137
NA,"north, completing the Calder Freeway upgrade to freeway standard the whole way from",137
NA,"Melbourne to Bendigo, and the Bendigo Airport upgrade. These are just a few of the many",137
NA,"projects that could benefit from regional infrastructure funding. Instead, the Liberal obsession",137
NA,with Melbourne means that these projects are delayed.,137
NA,But where are the Nationals? Standing on these roads and at the airport during the election,137
NA,"period, Mr Truss was happy to visit Bendigo Airport during the election period, but since the",137
NA,"election he has not been back. He did not even have the time to meet with the council, who he",137
NA,"met during the election period, when they were here a few weeks ago. These vital projects are",137
NA,standing still because the government has its priorities wrong when it comes to infrastructure,137
NA,funding. These problems are being ignored in favour of Melbourne projects.,137
NA,Good road and rail links are critical to supporting regional communities. If our farmers are,137
NA,to get their product to market they need a decent regional infrastructure system. Right now,137
NA,this government is not prioritising it in the regional parts of Victoria. The only major transport,137
NA,"project that Central Victoria will benefit from in the next few years is the Regional Rail Link,",137
NA,which was funded and started by former federal and state Labor governments. Yet I note that,137
NA,in a few months Denis Napthine and Warren Truss will probably be there cutting the ribbon to,137
NA,"say, 'Job well done.' Well, it is not a job well done for the Liberals and Nationals, because",137
NA,they were not the ones who allocated funding to it. They were the ones who simply sat back,137
NA,and watched money that Labor allocated in government to see the building of this project.,137
NA,NA,137
NA,"They have an opportunity right now to start planning for the next regional rail project, the",138
NA,Mildura freight rail upgrade. But we have not yet seen this government prioritise that project.,138
NA,"Without the amendments moved by Labor, asset recycling is a bad deal for states. Given",138
NA,"that the federal government already provides at least half the funds for many projects, where",138
NA,does the 15 per cent incentive sit when it comes to the 50 per cent allocation. There is a,138
NA,problem with the maths when it comes to this particular bill.,138
NA,"I urge the members of the House to support Labor's amendments, because only through",138
NA,"these amendments will we actually get genuine transparency and ensure that, if there are sales",138
NA,"of private assets, the funding goes towards projects that really will make a difference to",138
NA,"Australia and, in particular, regional Australia.",138
Mr SUKKAR ,Deakin) (16:43): I was really pleased to follow the member for Bendigo in,138
NA,"her contribution to this debate, because the member for Bendigo spoke at some length about",138
NA,her opposition to the state coalition government's policy in respect of the sale of the Port of,138
NA,Melbourne Corporation. There were a couple of minutes there where the member for Bendigo,138
NA,spoke stridently against that proposed sale. I suppose the problem for the member for Bendigo,138
NA,"is that she should probably speak to the state Labor opposition leader, Daniel Andrews, who,",138
NA,"in November 2013, committed the Labor Party, if elected, to sell the Port of Melbourne",138
NA,Corporation. So there we have it. The member for Bendigo has repudiated sensible state,138
NA,"Labor party policy, where they were brought kicking and screaming to accept that the sale of",138
NA,"the Port of Melbourne Corporation would be very positive. So, Member for Bendigo, I think",138
NA,you have a little bit of explaining to do when we head back to Victoria. I also suspect that it is,138
NA,another case of saying one thing in Canberra and another thing when we all head home to our,138
NA,electorates.,138
NA,"Before I start my contribution on the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014, I want to assure the",138
NA,member for Bendigo that nobody in Victoria-certainly nobody in the outer east of,138
NA,Melbourne where the seat of Deakin lies-refers to the East West Link as 'the dud tunnel'.,138
NA,She might be concerned about the inner-city Greens and the internal Labor Party fights that,138
NA,will happen with respect to-,138
Mr Fitzgibbon," On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: you cannot preface your",138
NA,"remarks by saying, 'Before I get to the bill I want to say this,' and claim you are being relevant",138
NA,"to the bill. The member, by his own admission, is not being relevant to the bill.",138
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Craig Kelly): There is little bit of latitude.,138
Mr SUKKAR, I commend the member for Hunter for trying to save the member for,138
NA,"Bendigo, but nothing will save her from the woeful contribution she just made.",138
NA,"People in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, in my seat of Deakin, greatly appreciate the",138
NA,Asset Recycling Fund Bill which we are here to debate today. Let us remember that this is an,138
NA,"agreement that the federal government was able to strike with every single state government,",138
NA,including state governments of the other political persuasion. So I find it very surprising that,138
NA,"the amendments being sought here are not being repudiated by those opposite. This bill, and",138
NA,"the Asset Recycling Fund, is a key component of ensuring that we meet our commitment to",138
NA,give Australia the infrastructure of the 21st century-something we spoke about ad nauseam,138
NA,during the election campaign and something we have spoken about ad nauseam since forming,138
NA,government.,138
NA,NA,138
NA,What sets us apart from the Labor Party is that we do not send out endless media releases,139
NA,"or make endless announcements. I do not follow New South Wales politics that closely, but-",139
NA,"gee whiz-I can recall that many infrastructure projects being announced three, four or five",139
NA,times. Even in my own state the Labor Party does it. There is no shame. They will announce,139
NA,the same infrastructure project time and time again-without any credible way to fund it. The,139
NA,Asset Recycling Fund will ensure that we have the means to deliver on our promises.,139
NA,The fund is designed to provide incentives and support for our state and territory,139
NA,governments to sell their existing assets and invest the freed-up capital into new productive,139
NA,infrastructure-infrastructure that will provide the foundations for a more productive,139
NA,economy. I could not believe the member for Bendigo-she was almost rewriting Labor,139
NA,history when bemoaning privatisations. I think we need to sit her down with former Prime,139
NA,Ministers Hawke and Keating. Perhaps she can educate them on the mistakes they made when,139
NA,implementing their very important privatisation agenda. It shows you just how far the once,139
NA,great Labor Party has retreated from what it was.,139
NA,The Asset Recycling Fund will start with an initial commitment of $5.9 billion. This,139
NA,money comes from uncommitted amounts in the Building Australia Fund and the Education,139
NA,Investment Fund and will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The Asset,139
NA,Recycling Fund builds on earlier coalition government measures to create future funds-,139
NA,"thanks, as we know, to former Treasurer Costello-to benefit current and future generations",139
NA,"by providing long-term investments in our future economic development, not just spending",139
NA,money with the next election in mind. These are not short-term measures. They are for the,139
NA,long-term benefit of the nation.,139
NA,"In the 2014-15 budget, the coalition government, unlike Labor, invested a fair dinkum $50",139
NA,billion into key infrastructure projects. I have been very gladdened to read that that $50 billion,139
NA,investment will support more than $125 billion of construction activity once you take into,139
NA,"account private sector and other sources of funding. In other words, a $50 billion commitment",139
NA,"by this government, which is unprecedented, unlocks an additional $75 billion of private",139
NA,investment.,139
NA,"Over the last few years, much has been made by members opposite about the need for",139
NA,"investment in infrastructure projects. Every question time, it seems, the former infrastructure",139
NA,minister interjects in some sort of desperate attempt to salvage some kind of legacy-but I,139
NA,"can tell him that that legacy has been shot out of the water, so he should just give up. We on",139
NA,this side of the House will deliver on our promise of modern infrastructure. It is a key part of,139
NA,"our Economic Action Strategy to boost jobs along with investment. Again, it was something",139
NA,we spoke about ad nauseam before the last election.,139
NA,Building the roads of the 21st century is a crucial step and I am very proud that prior to the,139
NA,"election, through advocacy from Victorian federal members-or federal candidates, as I",139
NA,was-we were able to secure a $1½ billion commitment in relation to the East West Link.,139
NA,"This is an unprecedented investment in crucial infrastructure for Victoria. Again, the member",139
NA,for Bendigo referred to it as 'the dud tunnel'. She should probably speak to the former Labor,139
NA,"state government and former Labor Premiers John Brumby and Steve Bracks, because the",139
NA,"East West Link, the most crucial infrastructure project in Victoria, was first identified by the",139
NA,former state Labor government through their Eddington review in 2008. The member for,139
NA,"Bendigo has effectively repudiated Daniel Andrews, the current opposition leader; the last",139
NA,NA,139
NA,two state Labor premiers of Victoria; and two great prime ministers-Bob Hawke and Paul,140
NA,Keating. I think that shows you exactly what has happened to the Labor Party.,140
NA,"In addition to the $1½ billion that was committed pre-election, we recognised, in order to",140
NA,"unlock Melbourne's west and to provide a second river crossing in Victoria, that stage 2 of the",140
NA,"East West Link needed to be accelerated too. Clearly stage 1, with our $1½ billion",140
NA,"commitment, will kick it off and get it started this year. But the additional $1½ billion for",140
NA,"stage 2 is recognition that, in order to have an entirely integrated road system in Victoria, that",140
NA,second river crossing-in addition to stage 1 of the East West Link-is going to be absolutely,140
NA,necessary. So there we go. We have $3 billion committed by this government to ensure that,140
NA,"the East West Link, stages 1 and 2, starts immediately.",140
NA,"Another huge advantage for the Victorian economy-not just once the road is completed,",140
NA,because we know there will be massive benefits for businesses and commuters-is that during,140
NA,"the construction phase of stages 1 and 2 of the East West Link over 6,000 construction jobs",140
NA,will be created. That is why responsible union leaders in Victoria have been desperately,140
NA,making pleas to the state Labor Party to get behind the East West Link. I suspect that secretly,140
NA,they wish it happens. They want the hard decision taken away from them. I can promise the,140
NA,"Labor Party that, yes, we will make the hard decision. In fact, it is not that hard; it is a very",140
NA,"positive announcement for Victoria. There will be 6,000 new jobs during the construction",140
NA,phase of the project.,140
NA,"What is the big problem with the East West Link? The problem is, for residents of Deakin,",140
NA,"Aston and Menzies and people who live in the eastern suburbs, the Eastern Freeway",140
NA,effectively ends at an inner-city street at Clifton Hill. This project will ensure that Deakin,140
NA,"residents commuting to the airport, across town for work in the West, or even into the inner",140
NA,"north or the CBD, will no longer have to sit on the Eastern Freeway for hours on end. A stark",140
NA,"example of that is that every Sunday afternoon, when I am making my way to the airport",140
NA,"during a sitting week, I sit on Alexandra Parade at the end of the Eastern Freeway for the",140
NA,better part of half an hour. This is on a Sunday afternoon. So I absolutely appreciate it when,140
NA,my constituents complain to me about the time they spend on the Eastern Freeway.,140
NA,"This is a huge fillip for the Victorian economy, it is a huge fillip for jobs growth and,",140
NA,"importantly for the residents of Deakin, the East West Link will ensure that the eastern",140
NA,suburbs are no longer forgotten and that the eastern suburbs have the infrastructure they,140
NA,"need-not only for small businesses but also for everyday mums and dads. Quite frankly, the",140
NA,"time you spend on the freeway often determines whether you get home to bathe your children,",140
NA,give them a kiss or read them a book before they go to bed. It is real life for these people. If,140
NA,"we are able to save mums and dads-and all family members-time commuting, there are",140
NA,productivity benefits but there are also deeply-felt personal benefits for everybody.,140
NA,The Asset Recycling Fund is the culmination of an historic agreement between the,140
NA,"Commonwealth government and the states, including Labor states. Clearly, there is bipartisan",140
NA,"support for it, if you put aside the endless opposition we get from members of the federal",140
NA,Labor Party. It makes sense. Recycling assets and ensuring that those funds from,140
NA,privatisations are contributed to productivity-enhancing infrastructure should not be anything,140
NA,"new. There should not be anything particularly novel to members opposite, except that it is",140
NA,"very positive. If it is novel to those opposite, then they should read the legislation and",140
NA,"consider it, because it makes complete sense.",140
NA,NA,140
NA,"If asset recycling means that rather than having endless media releases, endless photo",141
NA,"opportunities which the Labor Party was so good at for six years, we start delivering",141
NA,projects-we have men and women on the ground with projects actually happening-it will,141
NA,"be a huge fillip for the broader national economy, not just for the Victorian economy, and will",141
NA,have long-term benefits on the economy through more efficient freight movement and,141
NA,productivity of our citizens.,141
NA,"I congratulate the Victorian state government for working hand in glove with us, in respect",141
NA,"of our investment in the East West Link, because it has indicated to the Victorian people that",141
NA,"when you have state and federal governments who do not endlessly squabble, things can be",141
NA,"delivered. Ultimately, my residents in Deakin want to see action. They want to see things",141
NA,happening. They do not want to see blame shifting from one level of government to another.,141
NA,The $3 billion we are committing to the East West Link-and countless other infrastructure,141
NA,projects around the country-will be a huge shot in the arm for the Victorian and national,141
NA,economies. I therefore commend the relevant minister for this historic Asset Recycling Fund,141
NA,and congratulate him for being able to negotiate this with each of the states.,141
Mr CHAMPION ,Wakefield) (16:58): I was somewhat shocked to hear the member for,141
NA,Deakin say the word-not using the words 'asset recycling'. It slipped out; he could not help,141
NA,it; he could not keep it contained. The word 'privatisation' slipped into Hansard. He wandered,141
NA,"off the focus-group tested 'asset recycling', the Orwellian attempt by the Liberal Party's",141
NA,spinmeisters. They thought privatisation sounded bad: 'We'll call it asset recycling.' So we get,141
NA,this Orwellian bill. It does not have one dollar extra in infrastructure. All it does is link what,141
NA,was already in the budget in infrastructure spending-under Labor-to a privatisation,141
NA,scheme.,141
NA,"Of course, Labor is not against the selective privatisation of some assets. Indeed, in the",141
NA,Hawke-Keating years there were some privatisations-Qantas and the federal airports come,141
NA,"to mind. We have always taken a selective view, a public interest view, a public good view, of",141
NA,this issue. The problem with those opposite is that they always approach privatisation as a,141
NA,matter of ideology.,141
NA,"Labor's two proposed amendments to this bill are, firstly, to allow Infrastructure Australia",141
NA,"assessment of new infrastructure as productivity-enhancing projects, and that includes a",141
NA,"published cost-benefit analysis; and, secondly, the tabling of a disallowable instrument for",141
NA,"each privatisation and reinvestment transaction. That is for very good reason, because there",141
NA,"are sensible privatisations and then there are what the Liberal Party do, which are ideological",141
NA,privatisations.,141
NA,We see an inability of the language in this bill-and indeed in the language used by this,141
NA,government-to just be honest and talk straight with the Australian people. It is one of their,141
NA,government's problems in terms of the co-payment. We saw the member for Hume getting in,141
NA,a bit of strife today. It is one of the Prime Minister's problems. It is the reason he now has to,141
NA,"write to pensioners across the country, presumably to right some wrongs, to fix up some",141
NA,communication issues. This bill is about the encouragement of states to privatise their assets,141
NA,willy-nilly. There is a 15 per cent reward. There is a smaller contribution than states normally,141
NA,"put into infrastructure, which is normally either 50 per cent or 80 per cent. The government is",141
NA,putting in a small reward so that some state governments go on a privatisation frenzy-not in,141
NA,NA,141
NA,"the public interest, not selectively looking at assets in the public interest, but simply selling",142
NA,things off willy-nilly.,142
NA,We know what Liberal state governments do when they get any sort of encouragement in,142
NA,this area. I can tell you what happened in South Australia. In the nineties we saw the Olsen,142
NA,"government sell many assets that the state had, willy-nilly. They sold the state TAB for $50",142
NA,"million. That sounds like a good outcome, except that it earned $50 million a year. They sold",142
NA,"it to the Queensland TAB. Apparently there is some risk involved in gambling revenue, so",142
NA,they got that one off their books. That privatisation continues to plague the racing industry in,142
NA,my state to this day. To this day it is regretted. It was a foolish privatisation. It was a,142
NA,privatisation which was in no way in the interests of the taxpayers of the state of South,142
NA,"Australia. When the ideological test is applied, we get some pretty bad outcomes.",142
NA,The Olsen government also leased our electricity assets. This was not just unpopular; it,142
NA,also did not live up to the expectations. An article by Tory Shepherd in The Advertiser on 21,142
NA,"February this year carried the headline, 'ETSA sale cost South Australia $2b as prices soar,",142
NA,"says damning report on privatisation'. That report was by Professor Quiggin, who is quoted as",142
NA,"saying, 'South Australia is really Exhibit A in privatisation leading to higher prices.'",142
NA,I would just warn those opposite that it is all very well to be a cheer squad for these sorts of,142
NA,"privatisations, but I can assure them that often the rhetoric catches up with you when reality",142
NA,"hits. There are other reports, such as one by Dr Phillip Toner from the University of Sydney",142
NA,"in 2012, in which he noted, 'South Australia, which has a fully privatised electricity industry,",142
NA,"has the highest prices of all states.' He also noted, 'New South Wales electricity prices",142
NA,increased largely due to a massive increase in capital expenditure from the mid-2000s.',142
NA,It is an interesting point about New South Wales power prices. We know that power prices,142
NA,are a big issue for the public-a very big issue indeed. I would not blame any person across,142
NA,the country for being worried about electricity prices. But most of this is about privatisation,142
NA,"or, in the case of state owned assets, in the preparation for their eventual privatisation. In John",142
NA,"Quiggin's report Privatisation of Queensland electricity assets: A preliminary evaluation, he",142
NA,notes:,142
NA,"In South Australia, privatisation was advocated in the 1990s on the basis that it was necessary for",142
NA,"participation in the National Electricity Market. Far from reducing prices, the result was to raise them to",142
NA,the highest levels in Australia.,142
NA,"This was due in part to massively increased distribution charges. As the SA Essential Services Minister,",142
NA,Lew Owens noted in an interview with ABC Stateline (2003):,142
NA,The simple explanation for that is in addition to the wholesale energy price you have to add the,142
NA,network charges for the poles and wire businesses.,142
NA,They are dearer in SA because the assets were revalued back in 1996 prior to privatisation and,142
NA,locked in by legislation.,142
NA,"That is a very important observation by Lew Owens, who was the Energy Regulator in South",142
NA,"Australia. In the run-up to the privatisation of electricity assets, state governments typically",142
NA,fatten the pig before market today. They do that by gold-plating the infrastructure and by,142
NA,raising the prices that consumers pay. That is how South Australia ended up not just with the,142
NA,"highest prices in Australia but, as was reported on 21 March 2012 in The Advertiser, 'South",142
NA,Australia's power prices set to become the highest in the world says Energy Users Association,142
NA,of Australia'.,142
NA,NA,142
NA,Dr Jensen interjecting-,143
Mr CHAMPION, We hear the member opposite interjecting. They had a pretty fair go in,143
NA,terms of those power prices at the time. They were out there every day beating up on the,143
NA,"straw man that was the carbon price, but of course the main culprit in those price rises was",143
NA,network charges; it was the cost of poles and wires being passed on to consumers. That is a,143
NA,direct result of the privatisation of what was a natural monopoly-the poles and wires. This is,143
NA,"noted in a more recent report of February 2014, and in another one by Dr John Quiggin,",143
NA,Electricity privatisation in Australia: A record of failure. He notes on page 12:,143
NA,"In some cases, governments have sought to increase the sale price of assets by raising costs to",143
NA,"consumers in the lead up to privatisation, or by allowing price increases after privatisation.",143
NA,You cannot blame the entities that buy these assets for trying to gouge what are natural,143
NA,monopolies. Those opposite come into this chamber and talk about asset recycling; what they,143
NA,really mean is privatisation. They put in place a bill that has not one extra dollar for,143
NA,infrastructure and yet they claim the infrastructure is a result of the privatisation. Then they,143
NA,"make all sorts of claims about how these things will benefit taxpayers and consumers, who are",143
NA,one and the same. I can tell you that we have heard these tales before in the South Australian,143
NA,context. We have seen dramatic and detrimental effects on taxpayers and consumers. That is,143
NA,why you cannot be too much of a cheer squad for privatisation; why you cannot be too much,143
NA,of an ideological advocate for privatisation. You have to apply rational thinking to it rather,143
NA,"than just charging down a particular path. You have to be selective, when you are dealing",143
NA,"with state governments, about what you will reward and what you will not reward. That is the",143
NA,reason for Labor's amendments.,143
NA,This is an infrastructure con in so many ways. We hear the Prime Minister and others,143
NA,"talking about him being the 'Infrastructure Prime Minister'. If you look at my electorate, that",143
NA,is almost certainly not the case. The electrification of the Gawler to Adelaide rail line is a very,143
NA,important project for moving into town commuters who live in the outer suburbs of Adelaide,143
NA,"or in the town of Gawler, which is a large regional centre, and many people come in from the",143
NA,"Barossa Valley and further up the track, such as wheat belt towns like Mallala and Kapunda,",143
NA,"where I grew up. The rail project would be efficient and sensible. It would help people, would",143
NA,take cars off the road rather than putting cars on the road and would give people a far better,143
NA,"commute. I lived in Gawler some years ago, and I drove to town every day. I can tell you it is",143
NA,not a pleasant commute; you spend a lot of time in the car. It is much more pleasant to go,143
NA,"along on a train where you can read, relax and have a bit of time out and not focus on the",143
NA,traffic. That project was cancelled by the Abbott government. They do not want anything to,143
NA,do with public transport no matter how much sense it makes. That is a blow not just to my,143
NA,"state but to jobs in my state and to the northern suburbs of Adelaide, which has been the",143
NA,"victim of so many of this government's decisions, especially in terms of the automotive",143
NA,industry. We see the impacts of the Treasurer chasing Holden out of the country-something,143
NA,I talked to the House about once before. Now we see the impact of them cancelling important,143
NA,economic infrastructure for the state of South Australia-,143
NA,NA,143
Mr CHAMPION, The member for Barker visited the Barossa Valley recently he cannot,143
NA,work out that the very people who live there use the trains in Gawler. He comes in here and,143
NA,"he yells and barks and bleats, but his government-the government he is a part of-has",143
NA,NA,143
NA,cancelled this important project. I am reliably informed he has told his Liberal Party,144
NA,preselectors that he is going to be a minister within two terms. That is what he has claimed to,144
NA,the good preselectors of Barker. I hope that he fulfils that-perhaps he can knock off the,144
NA,"member for Mayo and put this project back on track. He will be a hero to South Australia but,",144
NA,"if he cannot, I hope his preselectors come after him. I cannot imagine a more joyous thing to",144
NA,do.,144
NA,"To conclude, this bill is in so many ways a complete con. It does not put an extra dollar",144
NA,into infrastructure. It does not put one single extra bit of tar or roadway down that would not,144
NA,have otherwise been put down. It takes the word 'privatisation' and then substitutes it with,144
NA,"'asset recycling', an Orwellian term that is designed by a Liberal Party focus group. This bill",144
NA,"hides the fact that in so many areas this government has turned the clock back, particularly in",144
NA,public infrastructure and particularly in my electorate and in South Australia. Like so many,144
NA,"things that this government does, it is a complete and utter sham. Only Labor's amendments",144
NA,can make this bill any better.,144
Dr JENSEN ,Tangney) (17:13): The difference between Labor and Liberal philosophies,144
NA,is the difference between good enough and never enough. The Asset Recycling Fund Bill will,144
NA,"turn lazy assets into hardworking assets, increasing returns and securing our children's quality",144
NA,of life well into the future. The country is in a mess because the Labor government battered,144
NA,"her with a mining tax, a carbon tax, pink batts, school halls, the NBN and so on. Today, this",144
NA,responsible coalition government has to think smarter about how we all do business. Interest,144
NA,"payments on Labor's debt are $1 billion per month-or $2,000 annually for a family of four. It",144
NA,is time to stop beating up on the country and time to start getting excited about her prospects.,144
NA,The Asset Recycling Fund is an exciting first step in paying down the debt and clearing off,144
NA,the Labor deficit legacy.,144
NA,The Commonwealth will provide states and territories with incentive payments of 15 per,144
NA,cent of the sale price of privatised assets with the returns to be re-invested into new priority,144
NA,infrastructure projects. The Commonwealth funding program is capped at $5 billion. The,144
NA,positive interest on the fund alone will make a significant contribution to paying off the,144
NA,"monthly national credit card bill. However, more importantly, the asset recycling bill provides",144
NA,"proof that this government is living up to its word to give hope, reward and opportunity to the",144
NA,Australian people and to deliver the roads of the 21st century. It is exciting to think that inert,144
NA,capital of underperforming assets will become liquid and available to the marketplace. This,144
NA,freed-up capital will inspire the genius of the market to deliver real solutions of those,144
NA,desperately short of 21st century infrastructure.,144
NA,Let's not fool ourselves about what this bill is and what it does. This bill is liberal because,144
NA,"it believes in incentive-it gives states incentives to take a long, hard look at everything they",144
NA,own. Every person on the street knows that a good return is dictated by risk and reward. The,144
NA,most stinging point is that there are those in Labor ranks capable of questioning the central,144
NA,"premise of what we are debating today-namely, if our state and federal asset is chugging",144
NA,"along, producing a nominal net return of two per cent-is that good enough?",144
NA,Let me speak here of the specific good from this legislation for my electorate of Tangney,144
NA,and for Western Australia. The Perth Freight Link is made possible through this bill. This is a,144
NA,comprehensive plan to get heavy-goods vehicles from the port to the airport. The Perth,144
NA,Airport and surrounding areas serve as a major passenger and freight network hub for the,144
NA,NA,144
NA,Perth metropolitan area. The need for this project has been driven by the expected doubling of,145
NA,"passenger air travel and the road freight task over the next decade, coupled with proposed",145
NA,consolidation of the Perth airport terminals. Figures I have suggest 11 per cent annual growth,145
NA,"for 2013 in use of runway 21, the southern runway of Perth Airport. Further traffic will be",145
NA,generated by industrial developments in the southern part of the airport and in the surrounding,145
NA,areas of Kewdale and Forrestfield and from commuter traffic in the eastern and south-eastern,145
NA,suburbs of Perth. The Perth Freight Link will stop the nonsense of stopping at 33 sets of,145
NA,"lights, as is the current situation. The importance of Perth Airport cannot be overstated in the",145
NA,"Western Australian context: think of the FIFO worker, the online shopper and the high-value-",145
NA,add exporter.,145
NA,One aspect of this project that interests me greatly is the envisaged public-private dynamic.,145
NA,For the first time the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments will be seeking,145
NA,opportunities for private sector co-contribution towards a major road project. The Perth,145
NA,"Freight Link has an estimated cost of $1.6 billion, with $925 million contributed by the",145
NA,Commonwealth. Private sector co-investment will ensure maximum value is achieved from,145
NA,taxpayer dollars with minimal impact on the federal budget.,145
NA,"With industry and government investment, Perth Freight Link is expected to establish the",145
NA,Roe Highway as the preferred east-west freight link in Perth. To support and sustain a,145
NA,"growing population and economy, developing freight links that clear congestion and ease",145
NA,pressure on existing roads will provide significant productivity uplifts for Perth. Increasing,145
NA,"the productivity of our workforce is the only way to secure our current standard of living, and",145
NA,to ensure our global competitiveness.,145
NA,"Perth Airport is growing. For example, based on figures of total departures between 2007",145
NA,"and last year, Perth Airport has grown by 61 per cent. Western Australia demands and",145
NA,deserves a clear and well-thought-out plan not just for this decade but for many decades to,145
NA,come. It is expected that Perth Freight Link will be opened by 2021.,145
NA,WA government estimates indicate that the Roe Highway extension will deliver benefits of,145
NA,$5.20 for every dollar invested; and the Stock Road and High Street improvements will,145
NA,provide $1.70 in benefits for every dollar invested. This game-changing project would never,145
NA,"have been delivered under the previous Labor government, which remains opposed to this",145
NA,vital freight link.,145
NA,But the good news for WA does not stop at the Perth Freight Link. The coalition,145
NA,"government is also delivering the Perth Airport Gateway, the Swan Valley bypass, the Great",145
NA,"Northern Highway upgrade, North West Highway upgrades, as well as Tonkin Highway",145
NA,upgrades.,145
NA,"In sum, this bill introduces incentive and asks the states: 'Why are you holding this asset?'",145
NA,and 'Is it really necessary?' The aim of this bill is that we turn that lazy two per cent into a,145
NA,strong six per cent return. This will enable us to pay down the Labor debt and stop paying the,145
NA,"$1 billion-a-month interest payments on that debt. Not only this, but in turn, it will provide a",145
NA,"springboard of capital from which new companies, ideas and ventures can be attained. This",145
NA,"coalition government believes in free enterprise, believes in ideas and believes in people. So",145
NA,"the liquidation of lazy assets will be transferred to a pool, a fund as set up by this bill, and",145
NA,moneys can be added and attached by interested parties and individuals.,145
NA,NA,145
NA,"Initial funding will come from the uncommitted funds in the Building Australia Fund, $2.4",146
NA,"billion, and the Education Investment Fund, $3.5 billion, that were established in 2009.",146
NA,Further contributions will come from the sale of Medibank Private and other potential,146
NA,"privatisations. Through the hard work, dedication and vision of the Prime Minister, Treasurer",146
NA,"and Finance Minister, this pool of moneys, joined as it surely will be by other moneys, will be",146
NA,able to provide people across Australia with the roads of the 21st century. That is the plan. It,146
NA,was a key part of a document called 'Our Plan-Real Solutions for all Australians'. We,146
NA,launched our plan in 2013 and now in government we are executing that plan-keeping our,146
NA,"promises to the Australian people, as we said we would. This is what good governments do,",146
NA,"and Labor will never understand that We said we would stop the boats, and we have. We said",146
NA,"we would reduce red tape, and we have. We said we would fix the budget disaster, and we",146
NA,"are. This bill will not fix everything overnight, but what an important first step it is. It is, in",146
NA,"essence, a pure marker of enabling legislation. It is creating incentive and cutting waste-that",146
NA,is what this bill is about; that is what the Liberals are all about.,146
NA,Labor would never dream of putting something like this before the House. It is akin to,146
NA,"cutting off their right arm, and that is the arm from which they eat the union's cake. There is",146
NA,no-one in this place who can honestly say that a commercial enterprise can stay fit by eating,146
NA,"cake. State assets have always been less competitive, more regulated, less effective and less",146
NA,"efficient than their private sector counterparts or comparisons. In brief, as we have seen time",146
NA,"and time again in this place, the Labor Party are incapable of taking the hard decisions. The",146
NA,Labor Party are congenitally incapable of putting Australia's interest ahead of their own party,146
NA,"political interest. Shame, Labor, shame.",146
NA,"We face a significant challenge. The previous government delivered five budget deficits,",146
NA,totalling $195 billion. Their last budget was another $123 billion worth of projected deficits.,146
NA,"We have implemented some structural savings in this budget, which will start low and slow",146
NA,"and which will build over time. What we are looking to do in this bill is to sell assets which,",146
NA,"whether in public hands or in private hands, will continue to provide services to the Australian",146
NA,community and which we believe the private sector would provide more efficiently and more,146
NA,"cost effectively. We will reinvest the proceeds from the sale of those assets. We will recycle,",146
NA,"if you will, by investing them in new productivity enhancing infrastructure. So we have got",146
NA,"infrastructure, existing assets, which we can sell and which will continue to provide benefits",146
NA,to the Australian economy and to the Australian community. We think the private sector,146
NA,would be able to do it better and we would be able to invest the proceeds from those sales in,146
NA,strengthening our economy into the future.,146
NA,"In the final analysis, it is about smarter choices and hard decisions. 'Smarter choices' means",146
NA,being cognisant of the extremely benign global monetary environment and the cheap money,146
NA,policies being enacted across many OECD countries. Smarter choices means knowing when,146
NA,"to 'hold'em' and when to 'fold'em'. When talk of tapering is on the table, it might be time to",146
NA,make hay. Sell at the top of the market: this could be as good a price as we will get. Lazy,146
NA,"logic says that you should keep depreciating the dirty old rust bucket until it falls over,",146
NA,because it still throws a two per cent return. It might cost a tonne in between but it still throws,146
NA,"off two per cent. Labor's lazy logic says that we should keep these unproductive, uneconomic",146
NA,"assets because we own them now, and we always should own them, because we always did.",146
NA,This is absolutely perverse. It is a lazy logic born of a fundamental distrust of the free market.,146
NA,NA,146
NA,It is a lazy logic born of a fundamental distrust of the Australian people. As a wonderful,147
NA,warrior woman once said:,147
NA,The only problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.,147
NA,"As this bill, the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014, will support the Asset Recycling Initiative,",147
NA,provides incentive payments to states and territories for the sale of assets if the proceeds are,147
NA,"reinvested in productivity enhancing infrastructure, it is critical that we hurry up and pass this",147
NA,bill. This fund will expedite strategic and nationally significant infrastructure. To quote that,147
NA,"famous Irish Liberal , and Leader of the Irish Home Rule Party, Charles Stewart Parnell:",147
NA,"No one can say to his nation, 'Thus far shalt thou go and no further'.",147
NA,"Similarly, I challenge any Labor member here today to look their constituents in the eye and",147
NA,"say that they purposefully opposed this bill, that they purposefully opposed progress and the",147
NA,building of new roads in their electorates. This great nation will march on. It must.,147
NA,The Liberal plan is ready and we are acting on our mandate. Our solid and terrific mandate,147
NA,"is to see our Real Solutions plan enacted and to return hope, reward, and opportunity to all",147
NA,"Australians and to build a safe, secure Australia. We will succeed. We will succeed because",147
NA,"history always sides with those with better ideas, and ultimately those with the right solutions.",147
NA,Those right solutions for fixing Australia's deficit and disaster are the Liberal's Economic,147
NA,Action Strategy-a strategy we outlined in the Real Solutions documents all those months,147
NA,ago. Real results do not have to be really hard. All it takes is for Labor to give up their lazy,147
NA,"logic and back our plan to get Australia back on track. We have done it before, and we will do",147
NA,it again.,147
Mr THISTLETHWAITE ,Kingsford Smith) (17:28): The Asset Recycling Fund Bill,147
NA,2014 and related bill are very bad bills. Once again they are a great example of 'Howardian',147
NA,"language. This is the language of the Howard government, which used to give titles to bills",147
NA,"which meant the complete opposite. I am reminded of the More Jobs, Better Pay Bill, which",147
NA,"was, of course, a title given to a bill that actually cut unemployment benefits. I am also",147
NA,reminded of Work Choices. Wasn't that a wonderful use of Howardian language for the,147
NA,"naming of a bill-Work Choices, whereby the most vulnerable in our society were given no",147
NA,choice? They were forced into taking contracts and conditions that cut their award wage.,147
NA,"Here we have it again in the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014. When I saw this title, I",147
NA,"thought: 'Gee, that's an interesting title for a bill. I wonder what this bill is about.' I read the",147
NA,explanatory memorandum and then I saw it-privatisation,147
NA,"This is exactly what this bill is about: privatisation. I thought to myself, 'why can't they just",147
NA,say that this bill is about selling government assets-selling assets owned by the people of,147
NA,Australia?' But no-because this government are all about deceit. They are first-class-tick-,147
NA,"when it comes to deceit of the Australian people. It was Tony Abbott, now Prime Minister,",147
NA,"who said before the election, 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions",147
NA,and no cuts to the ABC and SBS'-yet that is exactly what has been done in the current,147
NA,budget. What is worse is that the Prime Minister says that these are not broken election,147
NA,"commitments, and that there is no deceit at all of the Australian people. Well, the Australian",147
NA,people would be horrified to know that the Commonwealth is encouraging the states to sell,147
NA,"assets that are owned by the taxpayers of Australia, and offering a financial incentive for them",147
NA,"to do so-a 15 per cent payment on the sale value, which has been described by Chris Aulich,",147
NA,NA,147
NA,"a professor of public administration, as a 'bribe'. There is an expert in public administration",148
NA,and in the sale of public assets describing what this government is doing as a bribe-and that,148
NA,"says it all, about this government's approach to infrastructure development in Australia.",148
NA,"These assets-electricity, gas, water, transport, health, and education assets-are not",148
NA,owned by the Abbott government; they are owned by the people of Australia. They are,148
NA,government assets that deliver government services. They return dividends to the Australian,148
NA,"public, which allow them to invest in schools, in roads, and in education. In my state of New",148
NA,"South Wales over the last couple of years, the energy assets have been returning $1 billion in",148
NA,revenues to the people of New South Wales-and that money has been used to upgrade,148
NA,"hospitals, to build new schools and to upgrade schools. To think that these assets that are",148
NA,"owned by the Australian people are going to be sold-importantly, without any due diligence",148
NA,and without consideration of what is in the national interest; just so that a government can,148
NA,"secure a 15 per cent payment, or a bribe, as described by Chris Aulich, on the asset-is",148
NA,"somewhat horrific. It is akin to someone selling the family home to get a 15 per cent windfall,",148
NA,"and then renting for the rest of their life and, over time, paying more for an asset that they",148
NA,once owned. It does not make any sense. Governments should not be paying other,148
NA,governments to sell assets that are owned by the Australian public.,148
NA,"These two bills, the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund",148
NA,(Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014 represent the complete failure of this government to,148
NA,develop any plan to invest in infrastructure for the nation's future. Labor believes that the,148
NA,federal government should take a leading role in working with states and territories to fund,148
NA,"nation-building infrastructure projects, including setting government standards to allow",148
NA,"decisions to be made in the national interest, not according to a political cycle. Labor will be",148
NA,moving amendments in the House which would ensure that the Building Australia Fund,148
NA,requires that the minister may not recommend a proposal for Commonwealth funding unless,148
NA,the minister has considered advice from Infrastructure Australia as to the merit of the project,148
NA,"and, particularly, as to its contribution to enhancing our nation's productivity. That is the basis",148
NA,on which Australia should be making investments in assets on the back of the sale of other,148
NA,assets.,148
NA,"Further, we will move an amendment requiring the finance minister to table a disallowable",148
NA,"instrument, for each privatisation or re-investment transaction that the government deems",148
NA,"eligible for the incentive payment, as a precondition to the payment of Commonwealth funds.",148
NA,This is to ensure that there is some due diligence to this process. We cannot allow a blank,148
NA,"cheque for this government to do deals with states, and to allow those states to completely sell",148
NA,off assets without any sort of due diligence being done-with the carrot being provided of a,148
NA,15 per cent windfall on the asset sale price. It is almost immoral-to think that a government,148
NA,"would make such an encouragement, in a piece of legislation such as this, to sell off assets",148
NA,that have been owned by the Australian people for centuries and have returned dividends that,148
NA,fund additional government services.,148
NA,Given that the federal government often provides at least half of the funds for many,148
NA,"projects, the replacement of direct support of that nature with a 15-per-cent incentive that",148
NA,allows the federal government to withdraw from the historically large commitments that were,148
NA,made by Labor is a backward step. It is a sneaky and underhanded withdrawal from proper,148
NA,scrutiny of investment and planning for infrastructure in this country. This is an initiative that,148
NA,NA,148
NA,should sit on top of-it must sit in addition to-the high level of federal commitment under,149
NA,"Labor to funding nation-building projects in road, rail and other nationally significant",149
NA,infrastructure. The federal government's refusal to fund nation-building urban passenger rail,149
NA,"projects remains a major failure. These should be funded even-handedly, following",149
NA,independent advice from a transparent decision-making body. Failure to do so distorts state,149
NA,decision making and leads to suboptimal productivity outcomes. The Abbott government is,149
NA,on very shaky ground when it comes to investment in infrastructure. An article in The Sydney,149
NA,Morning Herald on 12 June reports that:,149
NA,The Abbott government has been accused of pork-barrelling after analysis of the budget's infrastructure,149
NA,spending revealed Coalition electorates are favoured for new money by a ratio of three to one.,149
NA,"A Fairfax Media analysis of the Abbott government's 2014 budget has calculated that, of the new",149
NA,"projects announced and funded, just under three-quarters were in Coalition electorates.",149
NA,"But it does not end there. The Herald goes on to report that, in comparison, the majority of",149
NA,projects which lost federal funding in the 2013 election-because of course we know the,149
NA,government reduced the amount of expenditure on infrastructure-were in non-Liberal,149
NA,"electorates, such as the Metro Melbourne Rail Link in Victoria.",149
NA,This politicisation of infrastructure is sad and petty. It is also harmful to our nation's,149
NA,"development and, importantly, it is harmful to productivity-building infrastructure in this",149
NA,country. Labor is happy to stand on its record with respect to investment in infrastructure; in,149
NA,"fact, we are quite proud of what we achieved as a government in the six years that we were",149
NA,"investing in infrastructure. Our record, and the facts, speak for themselves. When Labor came",149
NA,"to government, Australia as a nation was 20th in the world-20th in the OECD in terms of",149
NA,"spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP. By the time we left government, Australia",149
NA,was No. 1 in terms of the amount of money spent on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP-a,149
NA,great indication of Labor's investment in infrastructure. We lifted the funding from $132 per,149
NA,Australian to $225 per Australian. We created Infrastructure Australia to research and to rank,149
NA,proposed infrastructure projects based on their potential to add to economic productivity; and,149
NA,we delivered a national port strategy and a national freight strategy.,149
NA,Let us have a look at what the coalition has done since they have come to government.,149
NA,Almost all of its package is re-announcements of Labor-funded projects. I had to laugh in,149
NA,question time yesterday when the Minister for Infrastructure and Deputy Prime Minister was,149
NA,up here talking about so-called new projects that had been invested in by this government. Of,149
NA,"course, he cited the Port Botany rail freight project, which happens to be in my electorate, and",149
NA,which I happen to know is almost completed. It is almost finished-it is being built as we,149
NA,"speak, but the Deputy Prime Minister claims this as a new infrastructure project being",149
NA,invested in by this government. That is a great symbol of the approach of this government,149
NA,"when it comes to infrastructure and the claims they are making, and of the deceit they are",149
NA,perpetrating on the Australian people.,149
NA,"This government also refuses to invest money in public transport, dumping Brisbane's",149
NA,"Cross River Rail project, the Perth public transport package and the Melbourne Metro, and is",149
NA,in the process of gutting Infrastructure Australia by giving the minister the power to exclude,149
NA,classes of infrastructure from its consideration and to prohibit the publication of research.,149
NA,This point was confirmed by Infrastructure Australia representatives just two weeks ago in a,149
NA,Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications hearing into public infrastructure,149
NA,NA,149
NA,in Australia. In that hearing they confirmed that the minister is now able to direct,150
NA,Infrastructure Australia not to look at a particular proposal-which may be in the nation's best,150
NA,"interests, which may improve productivity and which may be a passenger rail program-just",150
NA,because the minister feels that way. That is not the way to develop infrastructure and to,150
NA,develop the productivity of our economy.,150
NA,"Labor doubled the roads budget to $46.5 billion, and upgraded 7,500 kilometres worth of",150
NA,roads. We lifted local government roads grants by 20 per cent. The coalition has committed to,150
NA,Melbourne's east-west rail link and Sydney's WestConnex project without a cost-benefit,150
NA,"analysis. Here they are saying 'Infrastructure Australia plays a valuable role, it should be",150
NA,involved in assessing the value of infrastructure projects; it should apply cost-benefit analysis,150
NA,principles'. Certainly when I was a member of the Senate the finance minister used to make,150
NA,quite a deal of the importance of a cost-benefit analysis before any government project is,150
NA,undertaken-and here they are in defiance of their own election promises and in defiance of,150
NA,their own rhetoric when it comes to assessing infrastructure.,150
NA,They have shamelessly re-announced Labor projects such as the Gateway North in,150
NA,Brisbane and the Bruce and Pacific highway upgrades. If you drive up the Pacific Highway,150
NA,"these days, you will find the Bulahdelah bypass has just been completed. You will go through",150
NA,"the Kempsey bypass, you will see the Ballina bypass which has just been completed, and you",150
NA,will see the Woolgoolga bypass being constructed. These are all projects that Labor funded,150
NA,"and put in place, and that Labor is building. I used to laugh, because I used to be the duty",150
NA,"senator for that particular area, and I would go up there to open various stages of the Kempsey",150
NA,"bypass, and Andrew Stoner, the deputy leader of the government in New South Wales, was",150
NA,always there claiming that this was a New South Wales government-invested project and,150
NA,trying to steal the media associated with the project. That must be something that runs in,150
NA,"conservatives' blood in this country, because that is exactly what has occurred again. The",150
NA,"disease has spread to Canberra, because that is exactly what is occurring with infrastructure",150
NA,and this government-they are stealing the credit for projects that were put in place and that,150
NA,were built by Labor governments and trying to claim them as their own.,150
NA,"In rail, Labor committed to more investment in urban rail infrastructure than all of its",150
NA,predecessor governments combined since Federation-$13.6 billion invested in rail projects,150
NA,"by the Labor government, which says it all about our commitment, particularly to passenger",150
NA,rail projects; and $3.4 billion in the rail freight network over six years. We also rebuilt more,150
NA,"than one-third of the network-4,000 kilometres of track. So these are bad bills. They are",150
NA,dressed up as asset recycling bills when in fact they are justifying privatisation of assets that,150
NA,are owned by the Australian people. It is a deceit perpetrated on the Australian people in the,150
NA,name of privatisation.,150
NA,Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) (17:43): I rise with great pride to speak about the Asset,150
NA,Recycling Fund Bill and the Asset Recycling Fund Consequential Amendments Bill. We went,150
NA,"to the election in 2013, and 7 September saw us elected as the government for Australia. We",150
NA,took four main promises to that election. No. 1 was to axe the carbon tax. That should be the,150
NA,"easiest thing in the world to do, because we had bipartisan support-Kevin Rudd lined it up",150
NA,and shot it dead. It was gone. He had laid it down and put it to death. That would be the easy,150
NA,"part. So we came in here and we passed the bill. Funnily enough, we asked the member for",150
NA,"Hughes, who was in the last parliament, if he was ever under any misconceptions about our",150
NA,NA,150
NA,"position on the carbon tax-we had always said it was going to go. But Labor, of course, had",151
NA,"a few views on that sort of thing. When we came in here, Labor said they were going to",151
NA,"terminate the carbon tax. But when the Minister for the Environment, Greg Hunt, stood up",151
NA,"and presented the repeal bill, Labor voted against it-and they are still voting against it. So,",151
NA,"whilst it has been passed in here, it is sitting over in the other place. But I will give that one a",151
NA,tick.,151
NA,Our second big one was to stop the boats. It has been six months without a boat. With a,151
NA,"little bit of steel in the spine of the minister involved, he stood up and meant what he said. He",151
NA,went to the party room and he sold us on what we were supposed to do-and we have stopped,151
NA,"the boats. We are actually shutting down detention centres in this country at the moment, so",151
NA,we can give that one a big tick.,151
NA,"The third one was to build the roads of the 21st century, and that one is on its way. I do not",151
NA,"think there is anything surer than Warren Truss with the bit between his teeth. Jamie Briggs,",151
NA,"the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, has been all over the",151
NA,"country telling us what we are going to do, how we are going to do it and the amount of",151
NA,money we will be spending. I was on the record in 2010 admitting and conceding that Labor,151
NA,"spent more on infrastructure, including roads, than the Howard government did. I was on the",151
NA,"record saying that. We will spend more than the Labor government did, just as the Howard",151
NA,government spent more than the Hawke-Keating government. The Hawke-Keating,151
NA,government spent more than the Fraser government. The Fraser government did not spend,151
NA,"more than the Whitlam government, though-no-one spent more than the Whitlam",151
NA,government!,151
NA,The fourth promise was to fix the budget. That is on its way. That is what the budget is all,151
NA,about. Our first budget is responsible. Everyone's shoulder is to the wheel. We have a national,151
NA,narrative for where we as a country want to go. We want to go back to the days when we,151
NA,lived within our means. I have always said that no business returns to profit by shutting its,151
NA,"doors. Similarly, no federal government budget returns to surplus by shutting down the",151
NA,economy. It is a delicate balancing act that we have to have.,151
NA,There was still a real growth in spending in this budget of 2.7 per cent. Those opposite will,151
NA,stick to their mantra of spending growth in real terms needing to be two per cent. They had to,151
NA,cut another 0.7 per cent further just to get to where they wanted to be. They said for the last,151
NA,six years that spending would be cut to two per cent growth in real terms. They never actually,151
NA,"achieved it. Of course, they also said that they would bring the budget to surplus a number of",151
NA,times. I am an auctioneer and I can count pretty high and pretty fast but-by jingo!-there is,151
NA,a bit of work to be done to try to keep up with the number of times they did that.,151
NA,How do we keep the economy moving? How do we keep the economy going? How do we,151
NA,"make sure that we do not stall the economy? An example is in Townsville, where we have",151
NA,state support for the ring road. The coalition government have brought forward the second,151
NA,part of that project. We want it done in one fell swoop because the local contractors want to,151
NA,make sure that the work is being done. That sort of tenacity and forward-looking and forward-,151
NA,thinking management by your minister and assistant minister on infrastructure spending is,151
NA,"something that should be held in high regard. Instead, it is met with derision from the other",151
NA,side.,151
NA,NA,151
NA,The Queensland government faces probably the biggest task in this country after nearly 20,152
NA,"years of Labor rule. It has a massive debt and deficit issue, far greater in real terms than the",152
NA,"Australian government. If you talk to Queensland Treasurer Tim Nicholls, he understands the",152
NA,challenge. The capacity of state governments over generations to earn and increase their own,152
NA,"income has been wound back. Tim Nicholls, the state Treasurer, will tell you straight away",152
NA,"that he does not like stamp duty and payroll tax but, if you take those away, he will not collect",152
NA,"any money to bring into the state coffers. It must be very tempting for state governments,",152
NA,"though, because they are faced with debt and deficit problems, to sell assets and simply retire",152
NA,debt. That would be a very tempting thing to do-to simply retire debt and try to get rid of the,152
NA,Labor memory as quickly as possible. This is what these bills address. It is about the benefit.,152
NA,"It is about having an asset and what comes of that asset. Yes, we should be retiring debt. But,",152
NA,"no, we do not want to stall the economy. There should be a pay-off and there should be",152
NA,benefit for it.,152
NA,When Treasurer Joe Hockey was in Townsville he was asked what he needed to see. He,152
NA,"was asked what, if he were to be the nation's Treasurer, he wanted to see. He said, 'I want to",152
NA,"see cranes in the sky. I want to see dozers pushing dirt. I want to see work being done,",152
NA,because we have to build stuff. We have to make sure that we are being productive and,152
NA,producing infrastructure.' It is not just infrastructure. Anyone can build school halls. It needs,152
NA,to be infrastructure that provides greater access for trade and commerce. That is what we,152
NA,need. That is where we want to be focused.,152
NA,When Andrew Robb was in Townsville he said not only do we have to be spending more,152
NA,money on infrastructure but we have to think about how we fund it. Every country in the,152
NA,world has an infrastructure deficit. So we have to try to figure out how best to address it.,152
NA,There is no way in the world that a government can just come straight out and spend the,152
NA,money. Maybe those opposite could! But no government with any sort of responsibility could,152
NA,just come out and spend the money to get our infrastructure up to date. So how do we,152
NA,maximise the best terms? How do we do the most we can for our dollar? It is by engaging in,152
NA,the private sector and engaging foreign capital. That is how we have to do it. The Asset,152
NA,Recycling Fund Bill is part of our response to that. These are the positive measures that we as,152
NA,a country and government will take to make it more alluring and profitable for state,152
NA,governments of the day who hold these assets to reinvest in their states and in their local,152
NA,communities.,152
NA,There are some technical aspects of this bill I would like to walk through. The Asset,152
NA,Recycling Initiative taps into private sector investor interest in established brownfield,152
NA,"assets-those are established assets, such as ports or electricity companies, with proven",152
NA,earnings-in order to fund new infrastructure projects. You will find that companies such as,152
NA,superannuation firms do not want to invest in greenfield sites because they would be risking,152
NA,"the superannuation of our workers forever. Where something has a genuine business case, that",152
NA,is what superannuation firms will invest in. They will not invest in greenfield sites.,152
NA,The Australian government is establishing the Asset Recycling Fund as a dedicated,152
NA,investment vehicle for providing financial assistance and incentives to states and territories to,152
NA,create new infrastructure that boosts economic growth. We are boosting economic growth in,152
NA,"Queensland. In Townsville, say, if the state government was to sell the Townsville port and",152
NA,"part of that money went into investing in new infrastructure, that could lead to new",152
NA,NA,152
NA,"commerce, which would lead to more people moving to Townsville, leading to people buying",153
NA,"cars and building and buying houses, and there would be stamp duty and registration-the",153
NA,money churn that goes through the community.,153
NA,The Asset Recycling Fund will be established from 1 July this year. This will allow,153
NA,funding to flow to infrastructure priorities and promote productivity and generate economic,153
NA,growth. The infrastructure growth package will build Australia's infrastructure for the 21st,153
NA,century. In the budget the Abbott government delivered a record $50 billion for infrastructure,153
NA,investment commencing with an initial $5.7 billion and the government is committed to,153
NA,adding to the fund over time.,153
NA,"If you speak to the trade minister when he travels overseas, he says that he hosts",153
NA,roundtables and at those roundtables they have serious investors and all sorts of infrastructure,153
NA,discussions. What they want to know is whether Australia will change the rules. We had lots,153
NA,of investment here in the mining boom and then suddenly we brought in the mining super,153
NA,"profits tax which turned into the mining rent tax-it's the vessel with the pestle, not the",153
NA,chalice from the palace! It was just a bit of a hodgepodge of bills and that sort of thing which,153
NA,"led capital investment to flee overseas. Andrew Robb, the Minister for Trade, has been told",153
NA,that if we are serious we will provide the ground rules and those are the rules under which we,153
NA,want to invest. What he is trying to say to those people overseas is that we are serious. The,153
NA,"Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the defence minister and the trade minister were all",153
NA,"overseas last week with key clients, key countries around our region and around the world,",153
NA,and they were saying that we are open for business. We are speaking with a coherent,153
NA,message.,153
NA,The Asset Recycling Fund will support the Asset Recycling Initiative which will provide,153
NA,incentives for states and territories to sell existing assets and invest in new infrastructure that,153
NA,supports a more productive economy. That is the key here. This sends the message that,153
NA,Australia is open for business all the way through. This historic agreement with the states has,153
NA,the potential to raise close to $40 billion of new infrastructure funding around the country.,153
NA,That is what we have to be doing here.,153
NA,The fund's purpose will be to have an explicit purpose consistent with government's,153
NA,"investment in productivity enhancing infrastructure, so it will not just be about building",153
NA,marine parks or shutting down fishing industries or anything like that. You will not be able to,153
NA,use it for that. The establishment of the investment fund will allow capital amounts to be,153
NA,invested by the Future Fund Board of Guardians to earn interest that will also be available to,153
NA,fund investment in infrastructure. This funding comes from uncommitted money in the,153
NA,Building Australia and Education Investment Fund-$2.4 billion from the Building Australia,153
NA,Fund and $3.5 billion from the Education Investment Fund. The Asset Recycling Fund also,153
NA,allows for the new fund to be credited with proceeds from the sale of Medibank Private and,153
NA,with the proceeds of any further privatisation initiatives.,153
NA,The key here is to look at who is looking after us. We have a bit of a history when it comes,153
NA,to putting money away. We have got the Future Fund which was looked after by Peter,153
NA,Costello at the time. He put the money there to start off with. That has gone pretty well with,153
NA,money in the bank to make sure that public servants have their superannuation paid for and,153
NA,"guaranteed, and that is a pretty serious investment.",153
NA,NA,153
NA,Payments to states and territories will be made through the COAG Reform Fund. Once,154
NA,"again, there are lots of checks and balances all the way through there. The project funding for",154
NA,the Asset Recycling Fund to cover payments to states and territories through COAG Reform,154
NA,Fund will require the approval of the finance minister following recommendations made by,154
NA,the Treasurer or the Minister for Infrastructure. So the Asset Recycling Fund will have Future,154
NA,Fund Board of Guardians. The Treasurer and the infrastructure minister will have the,154
NA,responsibility for ensuring that funds that pass through the COAG Reform Fund special,154
NA,account and the infrastructure portfolio special account are expended in a manner consistent,154
NA,with the purposes of the fund as set out in the legislation.,154
NA,We have a track record when it comes to these things. In places like Townsville we need,154
NA,infrastructure spending. We need to make sure that it is funded. We need to be able to fund it,154
NA,as well as we possibly can and get as big a bang for our buck as we possibly can. When it,154
NA,"comes to Townsville, we are delivering on infrastructure at our university. We are delivering",154
NA,$42 million for the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine. We have got the ring,154
NA,road going through-another $160 million-and there is the investment brought forward of,154
NA,$120 million for the Joint Logistics Hub at Townsville under construction as we speak. There,154
NA,is the Vantassel Street bypass. It was approved in 2010. It was supposed to start but we had a,154
NA,flood in 2011 so the federal government pulled funding for flood relief in Townsville and put,154
NA,it into flood relief in Brisbane. That is what Labor's infrastructure minister did. That is what,154
NA,Labor's infrastructure minister thought of North Queensland when it came to infrastructure,154
NA,there.,154
NA,All in all I am very happy with what is happening here. I think that we have to be smart,154
NA,with what we are doing and I think that with the leadership we have shown here and the,154
NA,"management that we will put in place, this is a great move for Australia. I thank the House.",154
Mr CONROY ,Charlton) (17:58): I am pleased to make a contribution on the Asset,154
NA,Recycling Fund Bill. In beginning I would be remiss not to comment on the contribution from,154
NA,the member for Herbert who lectured this side about stable ground rules and predictability-,154
NA,this from the party of regional rorts; this from the party that changed infrastructure legislation,154
NA,"to take away from an independent expert body, Infrastructure Australia, the ability to grant tax",154
NA,concessions for designated infrastructure investments and grant those powers to the Deputy,154
NA,Prime Minister who presided over the regional rorts affair. The hypocrisy and the chutzpah of,154
NA,The Nationals on regional rorts and infrastructure investment is beyond belief. But I will give,154
NA,"it to the member for Herbert: he said all that he said with a straight face, and I respect his",154
NA,ability to do that.,154
NA,"I am pleased to make a contribution on these bills, and the purpose of these bills-let's",154
NA,make no bones about it-is to encourage state and territory governments to privatise assets,154
NA,and recycle the proceeds into new infrastructure. Labor is moving two sensible amendments,154
NA,to the bills. The first requires that the minister may not recommend a proposal for,154
NA,Commonwealth funding unless they have considered advice from Infrastructure Australia as,154
NA,"to the merit of the project, especially its contribution to productivity. The second requires that",154
NA,the finance minister table a disallowable instrument for each privatisation or reinvestment,154
NA,transaction that the government deems eligible for the incentive payment as a precondition for,154
NA,"the paying of Commonwealth funds. In relation to the substantive nature of these bills, Labor",154
NA,believes that the federal government does need to provide leadership in collaboration with our,154
NA,NA,154
NA,states in funding nation-building infrastructure projects. Government standards are important,155
NA,in this process in ensuring that decisions on investment are made in the broad national interest,155
NA,and not in the interests of political parties. The work of Infrastructure Australia is critical in,155
NA,"this regard, and I will elaborate on this further in my contribution.",155
NA,Labor recognises that asset recycling can be beneficial in certain circumstances and not in,155
NA,others. It is the obligation of the individual state and territory governments to make these,155
NA,determinations in consultation with their communities. The federal government of course,155
NA,"already makes a very substantial contribution to many infrastructure projects, and Labor is of",155
NA,the view that it is a retrograde step to replace the substantial direct contribution with a simple,155
NA,"15 per cent incentive. If you are going to have a 15 per cent incentive, that cannot be an",155
NA,excuse for the federal government to retreat from infrastructure funding in other ways. Labor,155
NA,believes that this new asset recycling approach must be in addition to the very substantial,155
NA,levels of federal government funding in nation-building projects. Anything less will have a,155
NA,dire consequence for economic growth and prosperity in this nation. It is also worth noting the,155
NA,record investment in infrastructure that occurred under Labor-and this was delivered without,155
NA,state governments privatising their public assets to pay for it.,155
NA,All sides of the House agree on the fundamental importance of infrastructure investment to,155
NA,"the Australian economy. It is of vital importance that governments invest in roads, rail, ports",155
NA,and airports. The World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council on Infrastructure makes,155
NA,the very important point that the cost of building infrastructure is vast but the cost of failing to,155
NA,make these investments is incalculable. The OECD correctly identifies that upgrading,155
NA,"infrastructure drives competitiveness, boosts trade and promotes economic growth. So,",155
NA,investing and building new infrastructure as well as improving existing infrastructure is,155
NA,fundamentally important to growing our economy and improving productivity. And of course,155
NA,the completed and upgraded infrastructure assets deliver enormous benefits for the economy,155
NA,and our society as a whole. The OECD has also noted that new ways of infrastructure,155
NA,"financing are needed. And, as I have said previously, asset recycling can be an appropriate",155
NA,vehicle to fund new assets and infrastructure.,155
NA,Labor has proposed amendments that enhance this purpose. These are having Infrastructure,155
NA,Australia assess the new infrastructure as 'productivity enhancing' and the requirement to,155
NA,table a disallowable instrument for each privatisation or reinvestment transaction. These,155
NA,ensure that this asset-recycling vehicle is appropriate and is in the national interest. And it is,155
NA,"important that we include Infrastructure Australia in this process, because, since its creation in",155
NA,"2008, Infrastructure Australia has made a very important contribution to the way the federal",155
NA,government makes decisions on infrastructure investment. In the year Infrastructure Australia,155
NA,"was created, its chair, Sir Rod Eddington, said of the new body:",155
NA,"It introduces a bold new approach to identifying, planning, funding and implementing infrastructure of",155
NA,national significance across Australia. It also introduces rigorous and robust economic analysis of,155
NA,infrastructure investments prior to government decision-making.,155
NA,It is disappointing therefore that the current government is seeking to undermine its,155
NA,effectiveness and operation. It is clear that the Deputy Prime Minister wants a return to the,155
NA,days of infrastructure investment decisions being made on the basis of coalition electoral,155
NA,advantage and not the broader national interest. If the federal government is to pursue this,155
NA,NA,155
NA,"asset recycling model, it is essential that Infrastructure Australia remain involved in the",156
NA,process. The amendments we are proposing ensure that it does.,156
NA,"The amendment, which will ensure that, before approval, Infrastructure Australia provides",156
NA,"an assessment that the new infrastructure is 'productivity enhancing, including publishing a",156
NA,"cost-benefit analysis, greatly strengthens the bills. In speaking on the asset recycling bills, it is",156
NA,relevant to highlight Labor's approach to infrastructure investment and what we have seen,156
NA,from the coalition since they have come to government. Those of us on this side of the House,156
NA,are rightly proud of our record of achievement in infrastructure investment. Because of this,156
NA,"record investment, Australia has gone from being ranked 20th out of 25 in the OECD to being",156
NA,ranked second in terms of spending on infrastructure as a proportion of gross domestic,156
NA,product. This is a great achievement. It is an achievement that the last Labor government and,156
NA,the then Minister for Infrastructure should be rightly proud of. And it is a very important,156
NA,"statistic: because of Labor's investment, Australia is ranked second among the nations of the",156
NA,developed world in terms of infrastructure investment.,156
NA,And let's looks at what the results of that investment have been. The roads budget doubled,156
NA,to $46.5 billion; local government road grants were lifted by 20 per cent; $13.6 billion was,156
NA,"invested in urban rail infrastructure, more than all Labor's predecessors combined; and $3.4",156
NA,"billion was invested in the rail freight network. As well as these investments, the fundamental",156
NA,importance of infrastructure to Labor can be seen in the fact that we appointed the first-ever,156
NA,dedicated Minister for Infrastructure and created Infrastructure Australia.,156
NA,"Now, let's compare Labor's record with what the Abbott government has done in just nine",156
NA,months. They are re-announcing projects that have been funded by Labor; they are refusing to,156
NA,invest money in public transport; they have cut almost $1 billion out of financial assistance,156
NA,grants to local councils for roads; and they have cut $52 million to reserve a corridor for high-,156
NA,speed rail on the east coast and shut down the high-speed rail advisory group. What a pathetic,156
NA,start from a man who wants to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister. And it is no,156
NA,"surprise, because those on the other side have form on this issue. This is the coalition that",156
NA,delivered the regional rorts affair. We cannot forget the cheese factory that was funded and,156
NA,"closed down, the rail line that burnt down, the half-million-dollar grant to Coonawarra Gold",156
NA,"for a project that was never built, and my personal favourite: the pet food factory that never",156
NA,opened. Think of all those pets that are going without food now because of the regional rorts,156
NA,affair! And that is the track record of those on the other side. They have not met a barrel of,156
NA,pork that they have not wanted to get their hands into.,156
NA,This is important in the context of infrastructure in my region of the Hunter. On speaking,156
NA,"on this issue, we need to be very conscious of the needs of the Hunter Valley, which is a high-",156
NA,growth region and provides a very strong economic contribution to our economy. The Hunter,156
NA,benefited greatly from the previous Labor government's historic infrastructure commitments.,156
NA,The Hunter Expressway is the biggest infrastructure project ever undertaken in the region.,156
NA,"The $1.7 billion expressway, funded by Labor, has recently been opened. Its benefits are",156
NA,significant. It cuts travel times between Newcastle and the Hunter Valley by up to 25 minutes,156
NA,and provides an easier and more direct route to the Port of Newcastle for heavy vehicles.,156
NA,"The coalition's neglect of the Hunter is apparent in the recent budget. In the budget lock-up,",156
NA,when local Hunter journalists enquired about infrastructure funding in the budget for the,156
NA,"Hunter, Treasury officials referred them to the Hunter Expressway project. These officials",156
NA,NA,156
NA,were apparently not aware that the Hunter Expressway was funded by the Labor government,157
NA,"in the 2009-10 budget, and had been open and operating for several months. This",157
NA,demonstrates the complete lack of commitment to Hunter infrastructure from those on the,157
NA,"other side. When they were questioned about it, the only project they could point to was a",157
NA,$1.7 billion project funded and built by Labor.,157
NA,That is not the only important piece of infrastructure in my region that we should be,157
NA,"discussing. The Glendale Transport Interchange is the most important infrastructure need, not",157
NA,"only in my electorate of Charlton, but for the whole of the Hunter Region. Close to $40",157
NA,million has been invested in this project from all levels of government. I am proud that,157
NA,although the infrastructure concerned is primarily the responsibility of the New South Wales,157
NA,"government, the previous federal Labor government has invested $12.5 million towards the",157
NA,project. This funding is being used to complete major road works in preparation for the,157
NA,construction of the Pennant Street Bridge and rail overpass. This is a very large project that,157
NA,will take a considerable amount of time and resources to complete.,157
NA,The second stage of the interchange will require further significant funding. Unfortunately,157
NA,it appears that no additional funding was allocated to this project in the recent New South,157
NA,Wales budget. The New South Wales Liberal government has already committed some of the,157
NA,proceeds of the privatisation of the Port of Newcastle to light rail infrastructure in the inner,157
NA,"city of Newcastle. However, the residents of western Newcastle and western Lake Macquarie,",157
NA,"which I represent, are equally entitled to an allocation of funding from the privatisation.",157
NA,"Given Glendale is the most important infrastructure project for the Hunter, it would be",157
NA,inexcusable for the state government not to direct further funding to complete the interchange.,157
NA,"The Port of Newcastle was sold for $1.7 billion, in excess of double what the Liberal",157
NA,"government thought they would get for it, yet they are recycling less than $350 million of that",157
NA,"to the region. It is only fair that the Glendale Transport Interchange, the most important piece",157
NA,"of infrastructure in the region, is built with the proceeds from the port, a port built on",157
NA,"transport of goods that have come from the western suburbs of Newcastle, from West Lake",157
NA,Macquarie and from up the Hunter Valley. Residents there will directly benefit from the,157
NA,Glendale Transport Interchange. If this is an example of asset recycling under the coalition I,157
NA,"am very worried about what they will do in future, because it demonstrates again that they",157
NA,have only contempt for the Hunter and only pay lip-service to the region.,157
NA,The high-speed rail is another example of this contempt. High-speed rail is a fair way off in,157
NA,"terms of being economical, but Labor did the right thing in government. The member for",157
NA,Grayndler allocated $52 million to feasibility studies and put together a working group to look,157
NA,at preserving a corridor. These are all important projects which mean that when high-speed,157
NA,rail becomes economical on the east coast we will be ready to move. This will be a,157
NA,revolutionary project for the east coast and my region in particular. If it were feasible to,157
NA,"commute daily to Sydney in less than two-and-a-half-hour to three-hour each way, that can",157
NA,only be good for my region. It would grow the economic base and the population and really,157
NA,secure the future of Australia's sixth largest city.,157
NA,But the coalition have thrown all of that away by abandoning this effort. They should be in,157
NA,a position where they understand that advance planning is incredibly important. The Badgerys,157
NA,"Creek announcement this year, welcomed by people on my side, could proceed only because",157
NA,"in the 1980s the visionary Hawke Labor government preserved the land, did the planning and",157
NA,NA,157
NA,set aside the zoning of the land so that the project could go ahead when the time was right.,158
NA,"Those on the other side take no lessons from history, unfortunately.",158
NA,Another area where they show contempt for my region is the Resources for Regions,158
NA,program run by the New South Wales Liberal government. It is another example of asset,158
NA,"recycling, which is what we are debating in this bill. The Resources for Regions program",158
NA,aims to support regional and rural communities affected by mining by addressing,158
NA,infrastructure constraints. Local government areas that are identified as being mining affected,158
NA,communities are eligible to apply for funding from the program. The New South Wales,158
NA,"government recently added the local government areas of Cessnock, Maitland and Newcastle",158
NA,"to the list of councils eligible for funding. Late in the process they are only adding Cessnock,",158
NA,Maitland and Newcastle to this program for mining affected areas. I cannot think of any local,158
NA,"government areas that are more the heart blood of mining than these areas, except for one,",158
NA,"which is the Lake Macquarie City Council LGA, which is yet to be added to this list. I am",158
NA,"proud of the fact that there are six operating coalmines in Charlton. I would, however, ask the",158
NA,New South Wales government to explain how a council that has six operational mines within,158
NA,its boundaries is not a mining affected community. Perhaps the Hunter Liberal MPs can,158
NA,explain this to my constituents. It is outrageous that Lake Macquarie Council is not eligible,158
NA,"for this program, and it again demonstrates that the Liberal Party only pays lip-service to the",158
NA,Hunter Region.,158
NA,"To conclude, Labor is of the view that in certain circumstances asset recycling can have",158
NA,"merit, but of course state and territory governments have to determine this with their",158
NA,communities. The amendments moved by my colleague the member for Grayndler improve,158
NA,and strengthen the bills. The involvement of Infrastructure Australia in assessing productivity,158
NA,enhancements is important and vital to avoid the regional rorts we saw under the last coalition,158
NA,government. Having a disallowable instrument means that this parliament has the final say on,158
NA,how Commonwealth funding is allocated. God forbid those on the other side who want to,158
NA,support the privatisation of a hospital.,158
NA,"I can assure my constituents that whatever the fate of these bills, and whatever the future",158
NA,"intentions of the New South Wales government are, I will continue to lobby for improved",158
NA,"infrastructure in Charlton, most particularly the Glendale Transport Interchange, the most",158
NA,important infrastructure priority in all the Hunter region.,158
NA,I commend the amendments to the House.,158
Mr COLEMAN ,Banks) (18:13): I am very thrilled to speak on the Asset Recycling Fund,158
NA,"Bill 2014, a very good piece of legislation. I will start by responding to some of the remarks",158
NA,of the member for Charlton. He is always a colourful contributor in this place. The problem,158
NA,"with the previous government's approach in this area, as in so many others, was to announce a",158
NA,whole lot of projects and do absolutely nothing about funding them. We have seen this right,158
NA,"across the board, but nowhere more so than in infrastructure.",158
NA,"The list of projects is a list of infamy. In Western Australia, there was the Great Northern",158
NA,Highway and the North West Coastal Highway-neither were funded by Labor. In South,158
NA,"Australia, there was the APY Lands road network-not funded under Labor. In Queensland,",158
NA,"there was the Cape York regional package-not funded. In New South Wales, there were a",158
NA,"number of projects: Bolivia Hill, Mount Ousley, the Tourle Street Bridge duplication and,",158
NA,"close to the member for Charlton, the Scone level crossing-all unfunded projects. One of the",158
NA,NA,158
NA,first things this government had to do in this infrastructure space was fund these projects. It is,159
NA,"all well and good to put out a press release, to stand at the relevant intersection, shake hands",159
NA,"with someone and say, 'This is going to happen,' but unless you actually fund the project, it",159
NA,cannot happen. The alternative to funding it is to just borrow more money and increase the,159
NA,debt level of this nation. That of course is something we would not countenance. So there is a,159
NA,very clear contrast.,159
NA,The bill we are discussing today is a very good piece of legislation. In a very practical way,159
NA,it encourages the states to recycle their assets and to invest in new productive infrastructure.,159
NA,The fund has some $5.9 billion in it-a very substantial amount indeed. The fund will provide,159
NA,additional funding of 15 per cent when a state seeks to invest in an infrastructure project after,159
NA,recycling an asset. The combination of that 15 per cent incentive with a fund of about $6,159
NA,"billion means that, if the fund is fully utilised, there will be $40 billion of additional",159
NA,"infrastructure investment. This is important because these are big, expensive projects and it is",159
NA,not always easy to find the funds to make them happen. A 15 per cent incentive will be very,159
NA,"effective in pushing projects across that line of viability, projects that otherwise might not",159
NA,have happened.,159
NA,"Rather than creating a whole new bureaucracy, setting up a new department or setting up",159
NA,"lengthy negotiations with the states, the Asset Recycling Fund provides a very simple signal",159
NA,"to the states: if you are willing to invest in important capital expenditure, we will stand there",159
NA,"right beside you and provide a 15 per cent incentive. That will be critical because, as I said,",159
NA,many projects are just short of that line; 15 per cent will tip many of them just over it.,159
NA,Infrastructure is important economically because it is the economic gift that keeps on,159
NA,"giving. Once you put in place a critical piece of infrastructure-whether it is a road, a port or",159
NA,"any other similar facility-once you make that difficult decision to invest, in many cases,",159
NA,"many billions of dollars, that piece of infrastructure is then there for the long run. If it is a",159
NA,"road, say, it delivers for you on day one, it delivers for you a year down the track, it delivers",159
NA,for you a decade down the track and it delivers for you many decades down the track.,159
NA,Think about some of the iconic infrastructure in our nation's history. Think about the,159
NA,"Sydney Harbour Bridge, for example. What an extraordinary piece of infrastructure that is. In",159
NA,"the 80-plus years since its construction, it has generated incalculable economic benefits for",159
NA,the people of Sydney and for the nation more generally. Then there is the Snowy Mountains,159
NA,"scheme, another well-known example. Closer to the present day, there is the M4 highway in",159
NA,Sydney. Imperfect though it is-and we are going to fix that with the WestConnex-it has,159
NA,undoubtedly had an enormous impact in opening up Western Sydney to economic growth. We,159
NA,have seen many business precincts pop up along the M4. That would not have happened had,159
NA,the road not been there. With those business precincts-with the warehouses and the,159
NA,"factories-come the jobs. Ultimately, why do we care about economic growth? We care about",159
NA,"economic growth because economic growth means jobs, and infrastructure means economic",159
NA,growth. That is why it is so important.,159
NA,There is no question that infrastructure is important. I suspect even those opposite would,159
NA,acknowledge that basic point. But those opposite have shown an inability to take the really,159
NA,tough decisions in this space. There has been no harder or more important decision in,159
NA,infrastructure than the decision to build an airport in Western Sydney. Western Sydney has,159
NA,been crying out for an airport for decades. The original identification of the Badgerys Creek,159
NA,NA,159
NA,"site occurred back in 1969. I was born in 1974, so for my entire life there has been a proposal",160
NA,to build an airport at Badgerys Creek. We all know that there are complexities associated with,160
NA,"building a new airport. As a consequence of those complexities, the project did not get",160
NA,"approved. It did not go forward. It took the Prime Minister, with his vision of infrastructure",160
NA,"for the nation and for Western Sydney, to bite the bullet and make that hard decision.",160
NA,"Frankly, I think the vast majority of people in Sydney know we had to do it and know it",160
NA,was the right decision. There is a strong level of community support-and so there should be.,160
NA,Badgerys Creek is going to be a huge economic boon for Western Sydney. There will be,160
NA,"4,000 jobs in construction. That is great, but of course construction only goes on for so long.",160
NA,What is arguably more important is the ongoing economic benefit-the ongoing infrastructure,160
NA,"improvements, the productivity improvement, the fact that you will be able to get freight into",160
NA,Western Sydney more quickly and at lower cost. What does that mean? More freight comes in,160
NA,"and so you get more economic activity in Western Sydney, with more material moving",160
NA,through those warehouses. When more material moves through those warehouses-because it,160
NA,can move around so efficiently-what happens? More jobs. That is why it matters.,160
NA,"The best forecast is for an extra $60 billion in GDP by 2060. That is an important figure,",160
NA,but these figures can sometimes be a bit abstract. What does it really mean? It means a huge,160
NA,number of new jobs for Western Sydney. It also means that for Kingsford Smith Airport-a,160
NA,loyal servant of the nation for many decades-there is a reality about what it can and cannot,160
NA,do. It can only grow so far. The approval of a second airport means that we all recognise that,160
NA,Kingsford Smith has a logical capacity. That capacity will be reached fairly soon and,160
NA,Badgery's Creek will help to fill the void.,160
NA,Badgery's Creek is accompanied by the Western Sydney roads package. This is a critical,160
NA,"development. Bringelly Road, Northern Road and Elizabeth Drive are all roads that have not",160
NA,kept pace with the growth of Western Sydney. My colleagues the member for Macarthur and,160
NA,"the member for Lindsay, whose electorates are directly involved in this, have been articulate",160
NA,advocates for the need of an upgrade of that infrastructure. A $3 billion project will be great,160
NA,for the area.,160
NA,It is also great to see the cooperation of the state government. The Commonwealth is,160
NA,"providing some 80 per cent of funding for the Western Sydney road project, and the state is",160
NA,providing 20 per cent. This is a good common-sense example of governments rolling up their,160
NA,sleeves and getting things done. That is what the people of Western Sydney and Australia,160
NA,generally want to see.,160
NA,"Closer to my electorate, the government has made a very important infrastructure",160
NA,"commitment in stage 2 of the WestConnex. Most critically for my electorate, this means the",160
NA,duplication of the M5 East. The M5 East can be incredibly frustrating to drive on. It is only,160
NA,two lanes. This will make four. It is the main arterial road from the south-western part of,160
NA,"Sydney into the city-from the Beverly Hills interchange, which is in my electorate; the",160
NA,duplication going towards the city. Best estimate from the department is that it will save 25,160
NA,minutes for people travelling to the city in peak hour. That is an enormous benefit from a,160
NA,"productivity perspective and from a family-life perspective, because it means people get home",160
NA,quicker at the end of the day. That can only be a good thing. So there is great cooperation,160
NA,with the state government.,160
NA,NA,160
NA,There is a $1½ billion direct injection from the Commonwealth and a concessional loan of,161
NA,"$2 billion, which has really helped. As we discussed before, with these projects, it is often",161
NA,"about tipping them over the edge and making them happen, and that $2 billion concessional",161
NA,loan has got WestConnex and the M5 duplication over the line-so much so that the,161
NA,development will start next year and the project will be completed within five years. These,161
NA,"are lengthy projects, and that is a very good time frame.",161
NA,WestConnex will be a tremendous benefit and is consistent with the government's overall,161
NA,approach to getting the economy moving again. We see a similar situation in environmental,161
NA,"approvals, where the Minister for Environment has stepped forward and provided approvals",161
NA,for some $400 billion of projects that were sitting idle under the previous government in a,161
NA,"maze of indecision, red tape and bureaucratic malaise. The Minister for the Environment last",161
NA,"year, prior to Christmas-one of the first things he did on taking office-stepped in and said,",161
NA,"'These are critical and massive job-creating projects, and we are going to enable them to",161
NA,"happen.' At the end of the day, that is the critical role of government: enabling things to occur",161
NA,in the economy. The government has great limitations on what it can do regarding direct,161
NA,"intervention in the economy, and so much of that is best left to the private sector. What we",161
NA,"can do-and what we are doing, through this infrastructure package-is enable private-sector",161
NA,investment.,161
NA,"We are not used to that in my state of New South Wales, because in 16 years we had a state",161
NA,"Labor government. We had more announcements about infrastructure than the births, deaths",161
NA,"and marriages page. There were all sorts of things that were going to happen. I have to say,",161
NA,"we did as a populace, the people of New South Wales, become a little cynical. The",161
NA,Parramatta-Epping rail link was announced with much fanfare; we literally lost count of the,161
NA,"number of times. There were so many hard hats, so many fluro vests, so many announcements",161
NA,"and so much happening. At the end of the day, people will judge governments on their",161
NA,"results-as they should-and the infrastructure results in New South Wales, in that sorry",161
NA,"period between 1995 and 2011, were just appalling. That is why it is so great to see the",161
NA,"emphasis on infrastructure, from the New South Wales government working hand in hand",161
NA,"with the Commonwealth, in this asset-recycling area.",161
NA,One of the fundamental commitments of the government prior to the election was to build,161
NA,the roads of the 21st century. We know that we need that. We know that for too long difficult,161
NA,"infrastructure projects have been put in the too-hard basket. This government, through a",161
NA,"combination of direct investment, incentives for states to invest and getting rid of arbitrary",161
NA,"and excessively regulated approval processes so as to allow the private sector invest, is going",161
NA,to build the roads of the 21st century. WestConnex is a critical one for my electorate and this,161
NA,bill will assist in that tremendous government initiative.,161
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (18:28): I am speaking in relation to the two bills before the,161
NA,chamber: the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and the Asset Recycling Fund (Consequential,161
NA,"Amendments) Bill 2014, which would create the Asset Recycling Fund, the ARF. This would",161
NA,provide financial assistance and incentives to the states and territories to invest in,161
NA,infrastructure. It is the result of a national partnership agreement reached by the first ministers,161
NA,of the states and territories on 2 May this year.,161
NA,"The bill proposes that the Commonwealth provide states and territories, which privatise",161
NA,"their assets and recycle the proceeds into new productive infrastructure, an additional 15 per",161
NA,NA,161
NA,cent of the reinvested sale proceeds to the cost of new infrastructure. It must be remembered,162
NA,"that there is no new money here. It does not contain any new funding at all. In fact, it puts",162
NA,aside a bucket of money-$2.4 billion of uncommitted funds from the Building Australia,162
NA,Fund and $3.5 billion of uncommitted funds from the Education Investment Fund. In listening,162
NA,"to speaker after speaker from the coalition, you would think that billions and billions of",162
NA,"dollars in new money was being rolled out in this fund, but it is just a recycling of federal",162
NA,government funds which we created when we were in government.,162
NA,The government said they intend to make further contributions to the Asset Recycling Fund,162
NA,"from the privatisation of Medibank Private and other privatisations, unnamed. We created the",162
NA,"Building Australia Fund, the BAF, and the Education Investment Fund, the EIF, to fund land",162
NA,"transport and education infrastructure respectively, and those funds were doing precisely that.",162
NA,"The proposed ARF has similar governance provisions to those of the BAF and the EIF, as",162
NA,managed by the Future Fund.,162
NA,We do not believe these bills in their current form adequately maintain the governance,162
NA,"standards that we introduced for the BAF and the EIF. The shadow minister, the member for",162
NA,"Grayndler, has circulated proposed amendments that relate to governance standards, with",162
NA,proper cost-benefit analysis published by Infrastructure Australia and a disallowable,162
NA,instrument requirement for the Treasurer so that greater parliamentary oversight is a,162
NA,precondition of payment of Commonwealth government funds.,162
NA,Concerns about this legislation were raised in the Senate Finance and Public,162
NA,Administration Committee inquiry by the Australian Technology Network of universities:,162
NA,"Curtin University, University of South Australia, RMIT University, the University of",162
NA,Technology Sydney and Queensland University of Technology. They teach about a quarter of,162
NA,a million students in higher education campuses around the country. They looked at this,162
NA,legislation and expressed some concern about it and about the winding up of the BAF and the,162
NA,"EIF, especially as 59 per cent of the initial funding for the ARF comes from the Education",162
NA,"Investment Fund, which those universities have benefited from in the past. We know that",162
NA,higher education is going to be more expensive under this government. The ATN asked: if the,162
NA,"purpose of the ARF closely aligns to the purpose of the Building Australia Fund, without",162
NA,"proper public transport spending, what protection will there be for future higher education",162
NA,research and education related infrastructure spend? There was no response from the,162
NA,government to that.,162
NA,I recall a coalition policy at the last election-a so-called five-pillar economy-about,162
NA,research in higher education and world-class education. What they are doing here is taking,162
NA,away money from those areas. But that is to be expected from a government that does not,162
NA,even have a science minister. And anything to do with climate change or research or,162
NA,"innovation or creativity seems to get abolished. If it is a body, organisation or group that is",162
NA,"doing some public service, some social and economic good, and it has any of those terms in it,",162
NA,it was abolished in MYEFO or indeed in the budget. These bills are silent in relation to future,162
NA,research and education related infrastructure spending. It is typical.,162
NA,We heard those opposite criticise us about infrastructure. We have a proud record with,162
NA,"respect to infrastructure. I can recall many occasions in the last six years, in the time I have",162
NA,"been in this place, where coalition members voted again and again against infrastructure",162
NA,"spends, whether it was the necessary funds for recovery after the floods in South-East",162
NA,NA,162
NA,Queensland and the cyclones in North Queensland or the nation-building response we had to,163
NA,"undertake as a result of the global financial crisis-which those opposite think is a myth, a bit",163
NA,"like the Loch Ness monster. We had to spend that money to keep 250,000 people in jobs and",163
NA,to keep the economy going and avoid recession. Again and again we put forward bills in this,163
NA,"place in relation to an infrastructure spend to keep jobs in place, to help rural and regional",163
NA,"areas and urban areas with rail, transport, infrastructure for councils and regional and local",163
NA,"community infrastructure funding. We proposed the nation-building economic stimulus, with",163
NA,"the BER. In the last six years in this place, those opposite, who were critical of us in",163
NA,"government, voted against all those things.",163
NA,When we came into power in November 2007 we massively increased the infrastructure,163
NA,spend. We were ranked 20th and by the time we left office we were ranked No. 1. In dollar,163
NA,spends we lifted infrastructure from $132 to $225 per Australian. For Queensland it was even,163
NA,better. We reversed the blockages on productivity and infrastructure the coalition government,163
NA,"refused to address-ports, road, rail. They did not fund an urban rail project north of the",163
NA,Tweed; there was nothing in Queensland. When we were in government we spent more,163
NA,money on urban transport than was spent by every government in the history of the,163
NA,Commonwealth of Australia. We saw it as a priority to get people to commute to their places,163
NA,of work by public transport rather than by car. It is good for the economy and it is good for,163
NA,"the environment. We doubled road funding to $46.5 billion. We upgraded 7,500 kilometres of",163
NA,local roads. We increased grants to local governments through Roads to Recovery by 20 per,163
NA,"cent. In my area, Ipswich City Council got $6.5 million in Roads to Recovery grants-more",163
NA,than they had ever seen before.,163
NA,"It was not just that. As I said, we committed $13.6 billion to urban rail infrastructure. We",163
NA,saw that as a priority. We invested heavily in the national rail freight network-some $3.4,163
NA,billion over six years. We rebuilt more than a third of the whole network. We are talking,163
NA,"about more than 4,000 kilometres of track. We invested $64 billion in infrastructure and we",163
NA,committed tens of billions of dollars to further nation-building if we were re-elected. We also,163
NA,faced the terrible disasters that I referred to not just in Queensland but in Victoria and other,163
NA,"states, including the fires and floods in Western Australia. We addressed those issues. We",163
NA,ended the utterly shameless pork-barrelling that those opposite undertook. The ANAO report,163
NA,on regional rorts was quite damning of the Howard government.,163
NA,We started investing in regional and rural communities. We set up Infrastructure Australia,163
NA,"to get rid of inefficiency and increase efficiency in the economy, and we put a priority on jobs",163
NA,and productivity. The Abbott government have ignored my electorate since they have been in,163
NA,"power. The Abbott government never talk about the last section of the Ipswich Motorway,",163
NA,and the Howard government refused to build it. The Ipswich Motorway was the most,163
NA,important road project west of Brisbane. We spent $3 billion to upgrade from Dinmore to,163
NA,"Darra. Up to 100,000 vehicles a day can travel on that road at the most congested times. We",163
NA,"are talking about 100,000 vehicles a day potential. What did we do? It was planned, designed,",163
NA,built and opened under a Labor government. It was not just about turning up for a photo,163
NA,opportunity-it was done. You can drive on it any day of the week. It is important. The,163
NA,service roads took 25 per cent of the traffic off the Ipswich Motorway. When the coalition,163
NA,"voted against the Ipswich Motorway project west of Ipswich, the Blacksoil Interchange, we",163
NA,"funded it. We partnered with the then state Labor government and that project, the Ipswich",163
NA,NA,163
NA,"Motorway, created and sustained up to 10,000 jobs during the global financial crisis. There",164
NA,were 300 jobs created and sustained on the building the Blacksoil Interchange-$54 million,164
NA,"there. To the credit of the LNP state government in Queensland, they have come to the party",164
NA,"and that project will be opened later this year. That is critical for the 40,000 vehicles a day",164
NA,and the commuters in rural and regional areas not just in Ipswich and Brisbane but in,164
NA,"Toowoomba, the Lockyer Valley and the Scenic Rim and Somerset regions. We, under a",164
NA,"Labor government, did what the coalition government refused to do.",164
NA,My concern is that this 15 per cent-it will not be 75 per cent; it will not be 50 per cent-,164
NA,will be the basis of Commonwealth government infrastructure contributions in the future.,164
NA,That is what I expect will happen. This government has abandoned whole areas. The Prime,164
NA,"Minister is very good at saying that he is the Prime Minister for this and that. For example, he",164
NA,"is the Prime Minister for women, but he has very few women on the front bench over there;",164
NA,"he is the Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs, but he will cut $534.4 million in",164
NA,"programmatic funding for health, education, justice and other programs for Aboriginal and",164
NA,"Torres Strait Islander people; and he is the infrastructure Prime Minister, but he cuts rail",164
NA,"projects, like the Brisbane Cross River Rail project in Queensland and the rail link in Victoria.",164
NA,The government see that as a state responsibility. They keep rolling out projects such as the,164
NA,"inland rail freight project, saying they are their projects. We were funding them. They are a",164
NA,continuation of what we were doing. There are no new dollars in this bill. It is a fake and a,164
NA,"fraud. They are claiming projects that are being built but that the Labor government designed,",164
NA,budgeted for and funded.,164
NA,This legislation is really about a right-wing privatisation binge typical of coalition,164
NA,"governments. We see that in Queensland, my home state. We have seen the most despicable,",164
NA,disgraceful propaganda by the LNP and Campbell Newman on a $33 billion privatisation,164
NA,binge they are about to undertake. It did not do Anna Bligh and the Labor government much,164
NA,"good when they tried to privatise assets in Queensland, so I do not think it will do Campbell",164
NA,Newman and the LNP government much good when they go to the polls by March next year.,164
NA,The consultation was not genuine at all. It was bogus; a predetermined consultation process.,164
NA,"The majority of Queenslanders by the public response, even on the dummy website, the bogus",164
NA,"website, opposed it. A recent poll found that 47 per cent of respondents would be less likely",164
NA,to vote for the Queensland LNP government if they continued their drive towards,164
NA,privatisation of state assets. They spent $6 million of Queensland taxpayers' money on an,164
NA,"elaborate consultation program that was called Stronger Choices, and it was a flop. The",164
NA,"people did not want it. They did not want to privatise assets, but the LNP decided to do it",164
NA,"anyway. Organisationally, if the LNP in Queensland had any integrity, it would front up with",164
NA,a cheque for the taxpayers of Queensland from their own campaign coffers and put it back,164
NA,into consolidated revenue.,164
NA,This was an LNP propaganda campaign with a fancy website and incessant ads. When I,164
NA,"was travelling around the country, I found the ads everywhere interstate. As a shadow",164
NA,"minister, I was travelling in different states and would see the ads on TV channels. They were",164
NA,not even directed solely to Queensland. There were fliers in the mail. We even saw,164
NA,information kiosks in my electorate at the Riverlink Shopping Centre in North Ipswich which,164
NA,referred to a so-called $80 billion debt and annual interest costs-it was untrue. It was simply,164
NA,misleading and an overtly political campaign. It was completely misleading. The budget,164
NA,NA,164
NA,papers in the Queensland government reveal that the gross debt under Campbell Newman has,165
NA,"increased by $14.6 billion-or $833,000 per hour under the state LNP government.",165
NA,"In my electorate, in Ipswich, unemployment has gone up from 5.3 per cent to 12.3 per cent",165
NA,under Campbell Newman. So much for asset recycling. They privatised by stealth. They did,165
NA,not tell the people that they were going to undertake privatisation. There are organisations and,165
NA,"bodies in Queensland that have been privatised repeatedly, but the government has",165
NA,"undertaken these big campaigns to privatise the big stuff, such as the big energy companies.",165
NA,There is $33 billion on the table. The people do not want this legislation. There are,165
NA,"amendments that need to be considered, and the shadow minister will put them. This bill has",165
NA,real flaws. The whole privatisation commitment of this government is about an ideological,165
NA,"right-wing, free-marketeer, buccaneering system. It will not be copped by the public in",165
NA,"Australia. If the Queensland government thinks it can get away with that, wait until March",165
NA,next year and we will see how they go.,165
Mr FLETCHER ,Bradfield-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,165
NA,Communications) (18:43): I am pleased to speak on the Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014.,165
NA,"This very important bill will establish the Asset Recycling Fund, which is a dedicated vehicle",165
NA,to facilitate investment in new infrastructure. It will operate by providing financial incentives,165
NA,to state and territory governments to sell existing assets and to reinvest the sale proceeds into,165
NA,additional infrastructure. I want to cover three points in the time available to me tonight.,165
NA,"Firstly, Australia's infrastructure has significant deficiencies, and there is a backlog of projects",165
NA,"which need to be commenced. Secondly, these deficiencies are of considerable public policy",165
NA,"importance and, thirdly, this bill establishes a mechanism which will help to facilitate",165
NA,investment in new infrastructure.,165
NA,If I turn firstly to the proposition that we have a significant deficiency in the state of our,165
NA,infrastructure in Australia it is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the common themes,165
NA,of public policy commentary in Australia today. We can look at numerous sources of data; for,165
NA,"example, the World Economic Forum's 2010-11 Global Competitiveness Index ranks",165
NA,"Australian infrastructure at 22nd out of 139 countries. However, as Infrastructure Australia",165
NA,"pointed out, when you look at the measures that are more relevant to Australia, our ranking is",165
NA,in the 30s and 40s. Our total capital stock expressed as a proportion of our GDP is below the,165
NA,"average of OECD countries, and the position has been getting worse with public investment",165
NA,in infrastructure as a proportion of our GDP declining in recent years. These figures confirm,165
NA,the anecdotal impressions that many of us would get as we go through the shiny new airports,165
NA,in many Asian countries. We are being eclipsed in Australia by the infrastructure spending of,165
NA,"many developing countries, such as China and the Middle East. All of us, I am sure, have had",165
NA,"the experience of travelling through a modern, large, well-planned airport in Asia-I can",165
NA,"mention Hong Kong airport opened in 1998, Bangkok opened in 2006, Singapore's Changi or",165
NA,numerous airports in China.,165
NA,It is somewhat depressing to return to Australia and disembark at Kingsford Smith Airport,165
NA,with its rabbit warren of successively-added gates and the unedifying experience of being,165
NA,forced through the duty-free perfume and cigarettes before reaching the overcrowded,165
NA,"immigration control area. The unflattering comparisons do not stop at airports, as anyone who",165
NA,has used either urban or long-distance railways in Japan or China or Singapore knows only,165
NA,"too well. According to a 2010 report by the OECD,",165
NA,NA,165
NA,Australia faces a shortfall in infrastructure which could worsen with the demand pressures exerted by,166
NA,"the mining boom, population growth and environmental concerns.",166
NA,"Similar conclusions were reached by Engineers Australia, an organisation which prepares a",166
NA,comprehensive annual scorecard of Australia's infrastructure position. Its 2010 report card,166
NA,ranks some critical sectors as 'poor' and the overall position in Australia as merely 'adequate'.,166
NA,A report a couple of years ago by Infrastructure Partnerships Australia cites estimates of,166
NA,Australia's 'infrastructure investment task' as ranging from $455 billion in a 2008 report by,166
NA,ABN Amro to $770 billion estimated by Citigroup. The recent Productivity Commission draft,166
NA,"report into public infrastructure, issued earlier this year, cites a range of other estimates,",166
NA,including a $300 billion estimate by Infrastructure Australia in 2013. So it is clear that there is,166
NA,a range of bodies opining that Australia has a significant infrastructure shortfall. There,166
NA,"appears to be a broad consensus that this shortfall has arisen over quite a number of years, due",166
NA,to continued underinvestment.,166
NA,Let me turn next to the proposition that this is a matter of considerable public policy,166
NA,"importance and something that government and, indeed, the community ought to be very",166
NA,concerned about. The consequences of this under-investment are being felt in many areas of,166
NA,our economy and our society: the growth in exports from Australia is placing strain on our,166
NA,ports; there is congestion in our cities exacerbated by population growth and changing,166
NA,demographics; our electricity infrastructure is under pressure; and there is continuing,166
NA,"investment needed to support key industries, including mining. There are a range of other",166
NA,"reasons for the lack of investment in infrastructure and, therefore, the deficiencies in",166
NA,infrastructure are putting increasing pressure on our economic performance and on our social,166
NA,wellbeing.,166
NA,There is a clear and direct link between infrastructure and our national productivity,166
NA,performance. One of the best historical examples to explain the connection between,166
NA,infrastructure and productivity is the investment made by the US government in the interstate,166
NA,"freeway system in the 1950s. This was originally justified as a defence measure, but it had",166
NA,"huge productivity benefits, because it reduced the delivery times for goods and expanded the",166
NA,"geographic area within which any one company could cost effectively supply customers, and",166
NA,therefore increased the intensity of competition to the benefit of consumers and to the benefit,166
NA,of overall economic efficiency. There is quite a considerable economic literature on the,166
NA,productivity spin-offs from the US interstate freeway system.,166
NA,"Sir Rod Eddington in 2011, as the chair of Infrastructure Australia, noted that:",166
NA,"Productivity has slowed as a direct result of infrastructure shortfalls-time lost in travel, delay at ports,",166
NA,lost production due to water restrictions.,166
NA,"So the economic case for increased investment in infrastructure is a very strong one, but there",166
NA,"is also a strong equity and quality of life case to be made. John Kenneth Galbraith, the well-",166
NA,"known US economist-actually born in Canada, for the pointy heads-in the 1950s coined",166
NA,"the term 'Private Affluence, Public Squalor' to convey the idea of a rich society which under-",166
NA,invests in its public infrastructure. His point was that this harms social cohesion and results in,166
NA,a society which fails to reach its full potential. If congested roads mean that you face a longer,166
NA,"travel time to work, you are wasting time sitting in traffic, rather than being with your family",166
NA,or in pursuing other activities meaningful to you. That wasted time obviously has a substantial,166
NA,"economic cost, particularly when multiplied by the millions of people in the same position,",166
NA,NA,166
NA,but it has a very real social cost as well. Therefore one of the most important things,167
NA,governments can do to improve the quality of life of the people they serve is to deliver good,167
NA,quality infrastructure.,167
NA,Let me turn therefore to the proposition that this bill lays out an effective mechanism to,167
NA,facilitate investment in new infrastructure. It is an effective mechanism which recognises that,167
NA,"much of the day to day work of planning and, indeed, funding major infrastructure projects",167
NA,occurs at state government level but that there is an important role for the federal government,167
NA,in supporting the states in the work that they do. It is the mechanism contained in this bill to,167
NA,address that issue and to support and encourage the states which is a particularly noteworthy,167
NA,piece of public policy innovation.,167
NA,"The measures in this bill and the scheme which will be established are, in my view, very",167
NA,much in the tradition of some of ideas argued by the well-known Yale University economist,167
NA,"Robert Shiller, who a few years ago wrote a book called Finance and the Good Society. His",167
NA,"argument, essentially, was that the reputation of finance as a sector has not been that good",167
NA,"following the 2008 financial crisis; but that, in fact, on reflection, the role of the finance",167
NA,sector is of the first importance in delivering economic and social welfare. To quote from one,167
NA,"particular book review which summarised the argument, the reviewer noted that Shiller:",167
NA,… makes a powerful case for recognizing that finance … is one of the most powerful tools we have,167
NA,for solving our common problems and increasing the general well-being.,167
NA,One of the examples that Shiller gives is the importance of mortgages-the fact that through,167
NA,the invention of this financial instrument it becomes possible for most people to afford a,167
NA,"home, even though very few of us are in a position to pay the full capital cost of a home when",167
NA,"we first we want to buy. I would argue that, consistent with the notion that clever financial",167
NA,"thinking can deliver important social benefits, the essence of this bill is to establish a fund",167
NA,which will be used to offer incentives to the states to recycle their assets. It recognises that the,167
NA,"states-all of them-have significant assets on their balance sheets, many of which can be",167
NA,"sold. At the same time, the states and, indeed, the nation face a very large task in funding all",167
NA,"of the new infrastructure that is required. Therefore, if we can recycle the existing assets, if",167
NA,"we can monetise those existing assets, and take the proceeds to fund the provision of new",167
NA,infrastructure assets there is a very significant social welfare benefit to follow as a,167
NA,consequence. The mechanism set out in this bill to achieve that public policy objective is to,167
NA,"establish the Asset Recycling Fund, and this will be a dedicated investment vehicle with a",167
NA,focus on providing financial incentives to the states and territories to create new,167
NA,infrastructure.,167
NA,The Asset Recycling Fund will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. It is,167
NA,important to note that this board of guardians has a proven track record in managing,167
NA,investment portfolios in the public interest. It has been responsible for the management of the,167
NA,"Future Fund. In 2006, the balance in that fund stood at $64 billion and, as at 31 March this",167
NA,"year, it stood at $97 billion. So it is a significant achievement in managing that particular",167
NA,"fund, and that expertise is now to be deployed to manage the moneys that will make up the",167
NA,Asset Recycling Fund. The initial balance of this fund will be $5.9 billion and there will be,167
NA,further credits to come into the fund in the future. It will be used to help fund investment that,167
NA,expedites nationally significant infrastructure; it will also fund payments to local and territory,167
NA,governments under the Roads to Recovery program. This is a mechanism to unlock the,167
NA,NA,167
NA,balance sheets of the states to target investment in productive economic infrastructure. It is,168
NA,consistent with and facilitates the delivery of the government's Infrastructure Growth Package,168
NA,announced in the 2014-15 budget.,168
NA,The Abbott government has come to power with strong commitments in relation to,168
NA,"infrastructure, and this bill lays out a specific and effective public policy measure to give",168
NA,"effect to the policy commitments that we have made. On this side of the House, we believe",168
NA,that delivering modern infrastructure is a crucial part of the government's Economic Action,168
NA,"Strategy to boost economic growth and prosperity, increase productivity and create thousands",168
NA,of new jobs.,168
NA,The Asset Recycling Fund will be seeded with $2.4 billion from the Building Australia,168
NA,"Fund and $3.5 billion from the Education Investment Fund. Over time, it is likely that there",168
NA,"will be sources for additional funds to come into the Asset Recycling Fund-for example,",168
NA,should there be Commonwealth assets which are privatised. The consequence of the moneys,168
NA,being put into this fund is that they will then be available to be paid to state governments,168
NA,"under incentive arrangements, which will in turn encourage the states to look for opportunities",168
NA,to monetise existing assets and to take the proceeds from those assets and reinvest them in,168
NA,"vitally needed infrastructure-infrastructure in road, in rail and in other areas. This can in turn",168
NA,deliver not only the economic efficiency and productivity benefits that I have spoken about,168
NA,"and for which infrastructure is so important but also those vital social benefits, because people",168
NA,are required to spend less time in their car and so have more time left to spend with their,168
NA,family or doing other things of importance to them.,168
NA,I conclude with the observation that the question of refreshing and renewing Australia's,168
NA,infrastructure is very much on the national public policy agenda. There is widespread,168
NA,agreement that our infrastructure is deficient and there is a backlog of projects which need to,168
NA,"be commenced. The Abbott government is getting on with that work, and this bill establishes",168
NA,an additional public policy mechanism to underpin that work by establishing a significant,168
NA,fund which will allow moneys to flow to infrastructure priorities to improve productivity and,168
NA,generate economic growth. There are great economic and social benefits to be captured for,168
NA,our nation if we can find the best ways to fund and build the world-class infrastructure we,168
NA,"need, and the mechanism set out in this bill is an important way of achieving that public",168
NA,policy objective.,168
Ms RYAN ,Lalor-Opposition Whip) (18:58): I rise tonight to speak on the Asset,168
NA,Recycling Bill 2014 and related bill. Governments everywhere are exploring the possibilities,168
NA,that asset recycling may deliver. In a high-growth electorate such as mine and having met,168
NA,"with the National Growth Areas Alliance this morning, I am acutely aware that the provision",168
NA,of infrastructure is vital.,168
NA,"During the time of the previous Labor government, Lalor and many other growth corridor",168
NA,"electorates did benefit from infrastructure investment. In Lalor, specifically, funding was",168
NA,"provided through local councils for community centres, libraries and local road project There",168
NA,"were also capital investments into TAFE and university. The rollout of the NBN commenced,",168
NA,and our local hospital received funds to expand facilities. All of these investments were much,168
NA,"needed in our high-growth area. Locally, we benefited from major infrastructure investment.",168
NA,"The federal government contributed $3.2 billion for the regional rail link, set to increase rail",168
NA,access for both business and passengers-a project that will deliver economic benefits to,168
NA,NA,168
NA,"Victoria. This project, currently underway, is being delivered ahead of time and on budget.",169
NA,Those working on this project should be rightly proud of that achievement. And why is this,169
NA,project being delivered in this cost-effective and timely way? Because of Labor's initiatives,169
NA,during its term in government-that is why.,169
NA,"When Labor came to power in 2007, it inherited an infrastructure mess; it was more than",169
NA,an infrastructure mess really-it was an infrastructure disaster. The current infrastructure,169
NA,"minister was there during the Howard days, so he will not find it difficult to remember the",169
NA,Regional Partnerships Programme rort scandals. We on this side well remember the millions,169
NA,of taxpayer dollars wasted on projects in regional areas-projects that had dubious merit. The,169
NA,word profligate has been thrown around this chamber much in recent days by those opposite;,169
NA,"in error, I might say. But here we have a clear history. So what are some of the memories of",169
NA,the coalition government's infrastructure disaster? Projects like the cheese factory in,169
NA,"Wangaratta which was awarded $22,000 in government assistance-despite the fact that it",169
NA,"had shut its doors. That one comes to mind, as does funding provided to an ethanol plant in",169
NA,"Gunnedah: taxpayer funding was provided, but it actually produced no ethanol. The minister",169
NA,"must also remember the $600,000 federal government grant given to struggling Queensland",169
NA,"company Beaudesert Rail-against the advice of corporate administrators, and in breach of",169
NA,the program's own criteria. These examples are not a ringing endorsement of the coalition's,169
NA,"capacity to handle infrastructure. Back in 2005, the Business Council of Australia",169
NA,"acknowledged how cracked the Howard government's infrastructure funding system was, and",169
NA,called for a massive overhaul. As part of their Infrastructure Action Plan for Future,169
NA,"Prosperity, the council reported:",169
NA,…that the current state of Australia's most fundamental infrastructure – supporting all elements of the,169
NA,"transport network, energy and water supplies, and the basic facilities to support growing and spreading",169
NA,"urban communities – is in urgent need of reform, repair and expansion.",169
NA,They went on:,169
NA,We are at the crossroads in terms of infrastructure development as a result of poor institutional,169
NA,"arrangements and policy choices. Changes are required to alleviate current capacity constraints, and",169
NA,provide additional capacity to support high growth in the years ahead.,169
NA,"Let me repeat that, Deputy Speaker: 'as a result of poor institutional arrangements and policy",169
NA,"choices'; 'changes are required'. This was after, or during, the years that the coalition were in",169
NA,"charge of this country. And so, as is always the way, it was Labor who acted on the failures of",169
NA,that system. It was Labor who were determined to create an infrastructure funding system,169
NA,where government could make decisions based not on lobbying but on hard evidence about a,169
NA,project's worth; about a project's value to the community-and not on the basis of an electoral,169
NA,"strategy. It was Labor who announced that, if elected to government, we would create a",169
NA,"statutory body to create a balanced and strategic blueprint for future funding, and that is what",169
NA,we did with the Infrastructure Australia Act in 2008.,169
NA,Infrastructure Australia was created to enact evidence based decision making; to deal with,169
NA,"policy and regulatory matters; to drive reform on legal, tax, planning and infrastructure",169
NA,"finance; to evaluate the business cases of projects and project financing options, including",169
NA,"private-public partnerships; and to review the adequacy of Australia's infrastructure, identify",169
NA,"the gaps, and prioritise the nation's projects. Its first task was to undertake a nationwide audit",169
NA,"of Australia's infrastructure, and then to form a priority list for the future. Only infrastructure",169
NA,NA,169
NA,projects which met a minimum rate of return-determined through rigorous cost-benefit,170
NA,"analysis and review-were recommended. With Infrastructure Australia, Labor showed",170
NA,leadership by investing in nationally significant projects and by ensuring lasting reforms. Let,170
NA,us not forget that it was under a Labor government that infrastructure spending grew from,170
NA,$132 to $225 per Australian. It was under Labor that Australia rose to No. 2 in the OECD,170
NA,rankings by the scale of the investment made in fixed capital. And it was under Labor that the,170
NA,"total annual investment in our nation's roads, railways, ports, energy generators, water supply",170
NA,"facilities and telecommunication networks hit a record $58.5 billion in 2011-12, equivalent to",170
NA,"4 per cent of GDP. We on this side of the House invested, not to gain cheap political points",170
NA,"but because, after years of inaction under the Howard government, it was what this country",170
NA,"needed. Key to all of this was Infrastructure Australia, because their informed, evidence-",170
NA,based analysis and advice ensured that we were investing in the infrastructure that would,170
NA,"drive national growth and productivity. But informed, evidence-based analysis is not what the",170
NA,current government is about.,170
NA,"Along with some of my colleagues, I met this morning with representatives of the National",170
NA,"Growth Areas Alliance, an alliance of local councils that serve high-growth communities",170
NA,"around Australia. This alliance, which understands infrastructure needs and which has put",170
NA,"considerable time and effort into preparing reports for government, has received no feedback",170
NA,"on its submissions. I repeat, this alliance has provided government with valuable information",170
NA,and it has received no feedback. What does this tell us about our current government? It tells,170
NA,us that the coalition government seems intent on making decisions that have no basis in well-,170
NA,"developed planning, and that they are not intending to listen to groups from across this",170
NA,"country. Take, for example, my home state of Victoria: in the recent federal budget, over $3",170
NA,billion was allocated for the second stage of the East West Link. One billion of this will flow,170
NA,"into Victoria's coffers in just a couple of weeks. In a recent senate estimates hearing, it was",170
NA,revealed that this project has no business plan. You heard correctly-no business plan. The,170
NA,project has not been examined by Infrastructure Australia. It was also revealed that the,170
NA,"estimated cost-benefit ratio was lower than the proposed upgrade for the Western Ring Road,",170
NA,"a project that was not funded; indeed, a project to which some current funding is now being",170
NA,redirected. There are no detailed plans for the east-west project and no details about the land,170
NA,"or houses that will need to be compulsorily acquired, and no information about the road's final",170
NA,alignment. There is no detail about where this tunnel will come up; no detail about when it,170
NA,will see the light of day. There are no details about whether the road will be tolled.,170
NA,The state government provides hollow words about the benefit to the people in the west of,170
NA,"Melbourne, but those who live and work locally are having trouble making any kind of",170
NA,"accurate analysis due to the lack of detail. This project is years away from being shovel-ready,",170
NA,but this federal government has seen fit to allocate $l billion to the Victorian government.,170
NA,Something about this does not feel right. The chat around town is that the federal government,170
NA,made these funds available due to its nonsensical rule about not funding rail infrastructure.,170
NA,"The original Metro rail link, a project that was planned and researched over many years with a",170
NA,"strong endorsement from Infrastructure Australia, has now been junked in favour of the",170
NA,"current Metro light plan. Transport is a big issue in my electorate. In fact, Wyndham City",170
NA,"Council is running a campaign to 'get Wyndham moving', because people in my electorate are",170
NA,"commuting to work for two or more hours a day, whether it be by road or rail. To fund a",170
NA,NA,170
NA,"project that there is no detail for and to plainly ignore the Metro rail link project, which has",171
NA,"been endorsed by experts, is a slap in the face for my community.",171
NA,So back to the asset recycling bill. Asset recycling can have merit in certain circumstances.,171
NA,I suggest that merit can be determined through careful and detailed planning and deep,171
NA,"consultation with the community. This bill, however, does not seem to have those checks and",171
NA,balances at its core. This bill also has the potential to dilute the historically high level of,171
NA,"federal commitment to infrastructure funding, a level achieved under Labor. At the recent",171
NA,"meeting between Joe Hockey and the state and territory Treasurers, it was reported that",171
NA,"Victoria left the meeting 'very disappointed'. The Victorian Treasurer, Michael O'Brien,",171
NA,"pointed out that this asset recycling plan has very little benefit for Victoria, as the state has",171
NA,very few assets left to sell. Victoria sold off many of its key assets during the Kennett years of,171
NA,the 1990s. Michael O'Brien indicated he was disappointed the state would receive no credit,171
NA,"for the hard decisions of the past. Apparently, the federal Treasurer made it very clear he was",171
NA,not prepared to look backwards.,171
NA,Last year The Melbourne Review ran an article discussing the benefits of privatising the,171
NA,"Port of Melbourne. It makes the case for asset recycling in a positive way, but it also provides",171
NA,this caveat:,171
NA,Victoria's competitiveness and wealth are inextricably tied to the health of our infrastructure ... With,171
NA,"considered investment in projects that are genuinely economically sound, the process of",171
NA,commercialising Victoria's public assets would enhance our state's growth immensely.,171
NA,There are three words that stand out in that statement: 'genuinely economically sound.' This,171
NA,government wants to be known for its infrastructure. Many a time we have heard the Prime,171
NA,"Minister say that he will be the Prime Minister for infrastructure, as if saying it will make it",171
NA,"happen. If that is so, and if this government wants to be remembered for successful",171
NA,"infrastructure projects, then this government needs to heed advice such as that given out by",171
NA,The Melbourne Review last year.,171
NA,"The asset recycling program appears to offer very little for Victoria. It appears that, as this",171
NA,"government refuses to look backwards at the asset sales that have occurred in Victoria,",171
NA,Victoria will miss out on infrastructure spending under this bill. I also have some very real,171
NA,"doubts about the way this government is interacting with Infrastructure Australia, and whether",171
NA,they are taking into account the evidence-based information that they are being given in the,171
NA,decisions they are making. Nothing I have heard in this chamber gives me confidence that this,171
NA,"bill will ensure good service and good infrastructure for Victoria, or good service or good",171
NA,"infrastructure for growth corridors nationally. In particular, I have very little faith that this bill",171
NA,will deliver for my community in Lalor.,171
Dr GILLESPIE ,Lyne) (19:12): I rise to talk about the Asset Recycling Fund Bill and the,171
NA,"consequential amendments bill. The value of infrastructure and productivity to individuals,",171
NA,"communities, cities, states and nations is the essence of this bill. Some people do not quite",171
NA,"understand what asset recycling and unlocking the value of assets means, so I will explain that",171
NA,"process. Infrastructure, whether it be road infrastructure, telecommunications, dams, ports,",171
NA,"rail lines, hospitals, schools or utilities, delivers improvements in lifestyle, in amenity and in",171
NA,"production. The better that infrastructure is, the better the productivity. In particular, transport",171
NA,"links and telecommunication links need to be fast and efficient, because if they are not fast",171
NA,and efficient everything becomes more expensive. The old saying that 'time is money' really,171
NA,NA,171
NA,"does apply in this space. The longer it takes our producers to get products to market, the more",172
NA,"costs increase, and our competition gets an advantage. The less competitive we are, the less",172
NA,income there is for our nation and citizens. Poor infrastructure that is not efficient means more,172
NA,"expense, so our products become more expensive, which in turn means our competitors get an",172
NA,"advantage. That is really important, because one in five jobs comes from trade internationally.",172
NA,Increasing our productivity means that people will end up paying less for goods and services.,172
NA,"Poor productivity means goods and services become more expensive, so the cost of living",172
NA,goes up. Productivity gains bring the cost of living down. People are not connecting,172
NA,"productivity gains with cost of living, but that is what we as a nation have to do.",172
NA,The second thing that this asset recycling addresses is unlocking value. Unlocking value,172
NA,"means realising the value of one's asset. The states have many assets that hold value for them,",172
NA,"but that value is not realised in a financial sense. In the early years of our Federation, and",172
NA,"subsequently, the world economy and the Australian economy were quite different to what",172
NA,they are now. Many initiatives that we had-such as establishing major utilities and energy,172
NA,"systems, transport bodies such as Qantas, banks such as the Commonwealth Bank and the",172
NA,"state banks and things such as the old GPO, which became Telecom Australia-were",172
NA,bankrolled and run by governments. But both state and federal governments have vacated that,172
NA,space to a degree already. Most of these exits have been spectacular successes. You only have,172
NA,to look at what has happened to the Commonwealth Bank since it was sold off by the nation,172
NA,to see that. You only need to look at how Telstra has grown over the years since it was sold,172
NA,off to see that.,172
NA,"Initially, the scope, extent and capital required government involvement, but now we have",172
NA,a different world. We have huge amounts of capital available in this country both in private,172
NA,banks and in super funds that private enterprise could marshal. If the value of these assets,172
NA,were realised enormous amounts of infrastructure could result. Private enterprise now has the,172
NA,capability and the finances to run energy systems. It has demonstrated that time and time,172
NA,again. Previous governments have used the realisation of things such as Telstra and the,172
NA,Commonwealth Bank to pay off huge national debts. You only have to look at the debt that,172
NA,"was left behind by the Keating government to see that. The asset sales-Qantas, the",172
NA,Commonwealth Bank and Telstra-delivered most of the reduction in debt. Look at what,172
NA,happened with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Private enterprise used that,172
NA,intellectual capital and expanded it around the world. We now have a world leader in that as,172
NA,well.,172
NA,This is why our Asset Recycling Fund has been created. It has been created to facilitate,172
NA,financial incentives for the states and territories to sell or lease their existing assets so that,172
NA,they can realise a financial windfall and reinvest that in their own new infrastructure. The,172
NA,Asset Recycling Fund will be created by rolling the funds from the Education Investment,172
NA,"Fund, the proceeds of the Building Australia Fund and the proceeds from the sale of other",172
NA,"assets, such as Medibank Private, into this fund. The fund will be administered by the",172
NA,managers of the current Future Fund. We should have a lot of confidence because when that,172
NA,was created it was at about $60 billion and now it is worth over $94 billion. So they do a good,172
NA,"job at it. National partnership agreements, both in asset recycling and infrastructure, will",172
NA,guide this through the COAG process.,172
NA,NA,172
NA,How does this initiative work? What is its value to the states? The value is that the,173
NA,Commonwealth passes to the states from this fund an extra 15 per cent on the value of their,173
NA,"realised asset. So it is an incentive program for them to do that, but it is not just done willy-",173
NA,nilly. The asset recycling initiatives must demonstrate a clear net positive benefit to the states,173
NA,and the nation and enhance long-term productivity and the productive capacity of the,173
NA,"economy. Also, where possible, the private sector should be involved to leverage the public",173
NA,sector money that is going into the project and add it to private capital as well. This,173
NA,"leveraging of $50 billion of federal capital, added to state capital, together with private capital",173
NA,investment should support funds of up to $125 billion.,173
NA,This is for solid state infrastructure. It is not the back-of-the-poster infrastructure that is,173
NA,"delivered willy-nilly, such as the pink batts fiasco or the overpriced school halls fiasco where",173
NA,instead of the Keynesian economic multiplier effect we had an economic dividing effect.,173
NA,"Good, solid taxpayer money went into overpriced and very ineffective school halls. It was the",173
NA,odd school infrastructure project that delivered value for money. These projects that we are,173
NA,"encouraging the states to be involved in will deliver long-term, solid infrastructure. There will",173
NA,not be any 'cash for clunkers' in this scheme.,173
NA,"We will have real, lasting infrastructure, such as the Pacific Highway duplication, which",173
NA,will start soon in the Lyne electorate and head further north to the Queensland border. It is,173
NA,"going to deliver, because all of the products that we ship in and out of the Lyne electorate will",173
NA,"be coming and going on efficient freeways. It is going to reduce travel times, making",173
NA,transport costs cheaper. It is going to bring more tourists into the Lyne electorate. We have,173
NA,"this huge, burgeoning south-east Queensland market of potential tourists who will come",173
NA,"further south if they are not caught in traffic jams and on single-lane, winding and dangerous",173
NA,highways. You can see what has happened with the freeway coming through the Tweed down,173
NA,to Ballina and Byron Bay; it has opened up exponentially to the south-east Queensland,173
NA,market. We want it to keep coming down to Coffs Harbour and then down to Port Macquarie.,173
NA,Already the tourism market in our area has changed because of the duplication south of the,173
NA,"electorate from Sydney. We now have not only week-long tourists, we also have people who",173
NA,"come for three days or two days because it is within a threeor four-hour zone of Sydney, or",173
NA,even closer if you are coming up from Newcastle or the Central Coast.,173
NA,"As for other solid infrastructure that will be delivered out of this fund, we have the Roads",173
NA,to Recovery funding. In the Lyne electorate we have a lot of very poorly maintained roads,173
NA,which certainly can do with the Roads to Recovery funds that they are going to get out of this,173
NA,process. $16 million of federal money-up to $17½ million if you include the GST-is,173
NA,"coming out of this to fund repairs to the Bucketts Way. If you add the Thunderbolts Way,",173
NA,"which is another linkage into the Gloucester Valley, there is another $3½ million, so that is",173
NA,about $20 million of road infrastructure delivered locally into areas in the Lyne electorate.,173
NA,These will not be like the school halls and the pink batts infrastructure that disappeared into,173
NA,the ether. This will be lasting infrastructure which will deliver long overdue benefits in the,173
NA,local economy as well as the state-to-state commerce that I have mentioned with the Pacific,173
NA,Highway. So I commend this bill to the parliament because of all the potential benefits that,173
NA,will flow from asset recycling. The state government in New South Wales will be able to,173
NA,deliver new schools and new hospitals because of the benefit they will gain from recycling the,173
NA,NA,173
NA,value of the money that they realise out of this asset recycling process. I commend the bill to,174
NA,the House.,174
Dr LEIGH ,Fraser) (19:24): The Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel once said that he,174
NA,was for a market economy but not for a market society. I think that is a good way of,174
NA,characterising the differences between the two sides of the House on the question of,174
NA,privatisation. The perspective of the Liberal and National parties has always been a,174
NA,theological belief in the value of privatisation. Those on that side of the House believe in a,174
NA,market society. They believe that inherently privatisation is always good.,174
NA,Those of us on this side of the House take a much more pragmatic view to privatisation. It,174
NA,"was the Hawke government that privatised Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, but it has",174
NA,also been Labor which has stood up against bad privatisations. We have to admit in a debate,174
NA,like this that there is such a thing as a bad privatisation. Privatisation of the British rail,174
NA,"network is a classic example, a privatisation which ended up with consumers bearing higher",174
NA,"prices and getting inferior services. So when we are considering privatisations, it must be on a",174
NA,"case-by-case basis. Yes, we should look at the revenue that flows from privatisation but we",174
NA,also need to consider the situation of the asset. Is it a natural monopoly? Is it the kind of thing,174
NA,where there is going to be contestability in the market? Is the asset itself a natural role for,174
NA,government or is it something where we might expect the private sector to get more,174
NA,efficiencies? These are the questions that this side of the House asks on an issue like,174
NA,privatisation.,174
NA,At the heart of this Asset Recycling Fund Bill is the notion that an incentive payment of,174
NA,around 15 per cent of the value of the asset multiplied by the share of that sale price that is,174
NA,invested by this state into certain other assets should be returned to the state as an incentive,174
NA,"payment. But as a number of University of Queensland economists, Flavio Menezes and John",174
NA,"Quiggin chief among them, have highlighted, it is quite unclear whether this incentive",174
NA,payment is of appropriate size. One of the things it depends on is whether companies are in,174
NA,fact going to pay company tax revenue which is of that scale.,174
NA,Let me step back for a moment. The notion of paying an incentive payment has at its heart,174
NA,the principle that a government entity does not pay company tax. Once the asset is sold to,174
NA,"private investors, they begin to pay company tax. The Commonwealth gets company tax and",174
NA,returns a portion of that to the state. But that argument only holds if the company actually,174
NA,"pays a reasonable rate of tax. If it has very large deductions, and we have seen some of the",174
NA,potential loopholes in the company tax system arising in the debate over the base erosion and,174
NA,"profit shifting, then it is not going to be the case that the Commonwealth gain in company tax",174
NA,is 15 per cent of the sale price of the asset. We need to be very clear that this is only a very,174
NA,small share of what states have had ripped away from them by this Commonwealth,174
NA,government-$80 billion ripped out of schools and hospitals as a result of this latest budget-,174
NA,and it will be a very small share of that which states see returned to them in the form of this,174
NA,incentive payment.,174
NA,The idea of an incentive payment is not new. It has been floating around in the ether of,174
NA,Treasury and Finance for nigh on two decades just waiting for a buyer. The idea found a,174
NA,"gullible buyer in the form of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer who, when they walked",174
NA,"into office, bought an idea which had been considered and rejected by the Keating",174
NA,"government, the Howard government, the Rudd government and the Gillard government. So",174
NA,NA,174
NA,you cannot help thinking that the Abbott government is somewhere in the position of,175
NA,someone who finds themselves having inadvertently purchased the Sydney Harbour Bridge.,175
NA,They have bought an idea which so many others had rejected. And the reason they have,175
NA,bought this idea goes back to that Michael Sandel distinction between a market economy and,175
NA,a market society.,175
NA,"If you believe in a market society, if you believe that the private sector always does things",175
NA,"better than the public sector, then invariably you are going to be tempted to pay states to",175
NA,"privatise. But if you take a more pragmatic approach to privatisations, as we on this side of",175
NA,"the House do, then I think you are much more likely to be sceptical of privatisations, to want",175
NA,"to see the business case for a privatisation, to take the view that if it does not stack up on its",175
NA,own merits then the federal government should not be paying the states to privatise an asset,175
NA,that they would not otherwise have privatised.,175

NA,ADJOURNMENT,175
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. BC Scott) (19:30): Order! I propose the question:,175
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,175
NA,Tertiary Education,175
Ms VAMVAKINOU ,Calwell) (19:30): I rise to emphasise the importance of investing,175
NA,properly in universities and tertiary education and ensuring that access to higher education is,175
NA,determined by ability and not family income. I do so because it is one of my key,175
NA,commitments as a Labor member of parliament. I do so because I have had an overwhelming,175
NA,number of pleas to defend and extend our support for universities from my constituents. I do,175
NA,so because access to quality higher education is one of the most fundamental requirements for,175
NA,ensuring equality of opportunity and fulfilment of personal potential. And I do so because it is,175
NA,"one of the most fundamental foundations for a progressive, dynamic and growing economy",175
NA,and nation.,175
NA,"Sadly, this government's first budget ignores all these factors and instead marks the end of",175
NA,"fair and affordable higher education, and it is a betrayal of Australian students and their",175
NA,families. This budget will mean spiralling university fees for young people and demonstrates,175
NA,that the government has broken its promise not to increase fees or to cut funding to higher,175
NA,education. Not only has university funding been cut but student debt will skyrocket. Women,175
NA,"and students from lower-income families, as the people of my electorate understand all too",175
NA,"well, will be the hardest hit as they are made to shoulder a larger burden of university costs.",175
NA,These measures will be disastrous for our nation as a whole but they will cause a,175
NA,disproportionate amount of pain and disadvantage in my electorate in particular. In an area,175
NA,"where families struggle to cover the costs of everyday life, where low-skilled jobs are",175
NA,becoming ever harder to find and keep-in part because of this government's contempt for the,175
NA,Australian manufacturing sector-affordable access to tertiary education is a vital key to the,175
NA,"future for so many young people. It is not surprising, therefore, that I have been overwhelmed",175
NA,"by the number of calls, messages and letters I have received from my constituents, anxious",175
NA,about the future of tertiary education under this government. Our investment as a nation in,175
NA,"higher education is not only vital as a means of giving young people, regardless of",175
NA,"background, the tools for productive, creative and rewarding careers but also vital to our",175
NA,NA,175
NA,"future as a clever, competitive and productive nation. Our health as an economy and as a just",176
NA,"society depends on the quality of our knowledge, our research and our innovation, much of",176
NA,"which is developed in universities, research centres and other higher institutions.",176
NA,"We have heard a great deal about 'lifters and leaners' from this government, about the end",176
NA,to the age of entitlement and other such cliches to justify the withdrawal of the,176
NA,"Commonwealth from the bulk of its responsibility to build and maintain a fair, progressive",176
NA,and inclusive society. It has been argued that the burden of spending cuts must be fairly,176
NA,shared across the community. But we need to be careful that a sector as vital to this nation as,176
NA,tertiary education and research is not made to shoulder an unfair burden in this regard.,176
NA,Universities are already struggling to provide teaching and support. It is inevitable that further,176
NA,"cuts will translate into staff reductions, larger class sizes, axing of subjects and whole courses,",176
NA,"and, of course, cutting back on research.",176
NA,"Under the previous Labor government, despite the pressures and debates about adequate",176
NA,"funding models, we were at least clear in our support for university education. Greatly",176
NA,increasing the number of Commonwealth supported places and encouraging greater,176
NA,participation in tertiary education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds has always,176
NA,been central to the Labor Party. If the parliament agrees to the current government's proposed,176
NA,"changes to HECS fees and student support, we will seriously undermine the ability of students",176
NA,from disadvantaged communities to attend university.,176
NA,"My electorate of Calwell, one of the most disadvantaged in the country, also has one of the",176
NA,lowest rates of tertiary education participation. The funding cuts to universities and changes to,176
NA,HECS would obviously exacerbate this worrying trend and further entrench generational,176
NA,disadvantage. I speak for a great many Australians in my electorate and elsewhere in saying,176
NA,that proper levels of investment in our greatly valued tertiary institutions are imperative if we,176
NA,"are to be a fair, competitive and clever country.",176
NA,Durack Electorate: Wiluna,176
Ms PRICE ,Durack) (19:35): I spent a very cold night on the edge of the desert last week,176
NA,when I met with various stakeholders and residents in one of Western Australia's most remote,176
NA,"towns, Wiluna-and may I say I had the best sleep I had had in 18 months. Wiluna was once",176
NA,"a thriving regional hub and is where my mother spent her childhood. Sadly, times have",176
NA,"changed, and Wiluna is often now forgotten, particularly by government.",176
NA,"Wiluna is located 1,200 kilometres from Perth. Its closest regional centre is Kalgoorlie,",176
NA,"some 500 kilometres away. When you look up the word 'isolated' in the Australian dictionary,",176
NA,"the town of Wiluna would best meet its description. According to 2011 census data, 1,150",176
NA,"people live in the town. However, this data is largely skewed due to a large proportion of fly-",176
NA,in fly-out miners and medical staff and a general underrepresentation of Aboriginal peoples in,176
NA,"official records. It is a town often characterised by chronic homelessness, poor health and",176
NA,"wellbeing, alcoholism, violence, poverty and poor education outcomes. However, despite the",176
NA,"challenges this town faces daily, I was humbled by the residents' tenacity and their desire not",176
NA,only to improve the town but to see it thrive.,176
NA,Although Wiluna is listed as 'very remote' on the Accessibility/Remoteness Index for,176
NA,"Australia, the town has largely been forgotten in its delivery of key services, such as housing,",176
NA,welfare and road infrastructure. Its isolation means that the town has very little access to,176
NA,NA,176
NA,goods and services or opportunities for social interaction. Meekatharra is often referred to as,177
NA,"its sister town, despite being about 180 kilometres away on the Goldfields Highway. The",177
NA,"connection between these two towns is vital, particularly for the provision of medical",177
NA,"services, with the Meekatharra hospital delivering key emergency and outpatient care in the",177
NA,region.,177
NA,For all other medical services Wiluna relies on FIFO doctors and other medical,177
NA,professionals at the Ngangganawili Aboriginal Health Service Community. NAHS plays a,177
NA,very important role in providing comprehensive primary health care services to Wiluna and,177
NA,"surrounding areas, but the importance of having access to hospital services, particularly in a",177
NA,"town that has prevailing health concerns, cannot be taken lightly. It is also important to note",177
NA,"that NAHS is the sole provider of medical services to the town, and aids both Indigenous and",177
NA,"non-Indigenous people equally, making it a very unique organisation, being funded equally by",177
NA,the state and federal governments.,177
NA,Wiluna is situated on the edge of the desert at the gateway to the Canning Stock Route and,177
NA,"Gunbarrel Highway. It should be a key tourism access point. However, due to the prevalence",177
NA,"of very dangerous road conditions, Wiluna is often bypassed by tourists, further reducing its",177
NA,"future economic viability. In particular, the upgrading of the Goldfields Highway between",177
NA,Wiluna and Meekatharra is vital for the town's future. It is currently the only section of the,177
NA,"state highway that is largely unsealed, creating adverse impacts on safety due to dust and road",177
NA,"conditions, on access to the town, and on its amenity and transport efficiency. It has seen",177
NA,many fatalities and numerous accidents.,177
NA,"The Goldfields Highway is considered a key strategic freight, tourist and inter-town route,",177
NA,"yet little has been done to seal this section of road, which floods in minor weather conditions",177
NA,and blocks all access to the town. The need to upgrade the road between Wiluna and,177
NA,Meekatharra has been accepted by the Western Australian state government for well over a,177
NA,"decade, with $70 million promised to seal the road in 1998. Sadly, this never eventuated. In",177
NA,"2012, $20 million was however dedicated by the state government and the main roads",177
NA,"department for the construction and sealing of passing lanes and floodways, but this was only",177
NA,for very small sections.,177
NA,Having an entire town cut off from medical services is simply not acceptable in today's,177
NA,society. Medicines are often transported from Meekatharra via mail using this unreliable and,177
NA,unsafe transport route. I will be pushing for my state and federal government colleagues to,177
NA,"make this road a priority, by ensuring Wiluna's collaborative voice is heard.",177
NA,"Thanks to NAHS CEO Richard Whittington, Shire of Wiluna CEO Andrea Nunan,",177
NA,"President Jim Quadrio, Gillian and Malcolm Marchant from the Gunbarrel Laager Traveller's",177
NA,"Rest and Art Gallery Manager Heather Charlton, together with Bernie Weller and Greg and",177
NA,"Fran Weller, for helping me to organise this trip. I thank them for their hospitality.",177
NA,Budget,177
Ms OWENS ,Parramatta) (19:40): It is not just the unfairness of the budget that hangs,177
NA,"around the neck of the government, nor the canyon between what they promised prior to the",177
NA,election and what they delivered. It is also that when you try to work out why they have been,177
NA,"so savage in cuts to the vulnerable, yet so generous in other areas, it is almost impossible to",177
NA,NA,177
NA,see any reason. It is the contradictions in this budget as well as the unfairness and dishonesty,178
NA,that cause such outrage.,178
NA,They say they are concerned about the number of people who will be on the pension in,178
NA,"2050, but they delay the very increases in super that would reduce reliance on the pension,",178
NA,resulting in more people needing the pension. Then they reduce indexation of the pension,178
NA,"itself. They say they are concerned about health care costs, but rather than try to keep people",178
NA,"healthy and out of the medical system, they cut funding to preventative health, making it more",178
NA,"likely that people will need to see a doctor, and then when they do they slug them with a GP",178
NA,tax. If someone delays visiting a doctor as a result of the GP tax and gets more sick down the,178
NA,"track, they have cut funding to hospitals.",178
NA,"They say they are building the infrastructure of the 21st century, yet they have walked",178
NA,away from a high-quality NBN and spend their time re-announcing road projects that were,178
NA,funded or even begun before they were in government. They have cut all funding to urban rail,178
NA,"projects, so if you live in the city you are more likely to have to drive, and when you do, they",178
NA,charge you more for the petrol.,178
NA,"They say they want young people to work, yet they have cut the youth programs that help",178
NA,"get vulnerable young people back into school or work. Then, when they cannot get back on",178
NA,"track, they slug them with a six-month delay for the dole. They removed the cap on fees so",178
NA,"that universities can charge whatever they like, supposedly so that there will be more places,",178
NA,"but in doing so they put the cost out of reach for many people-more places, but less",178
NA,affordable.,178
NA,"They say they are about getting women into work, and they introduce an expensive paid",178
NA,"parental leave scheme, but at the same time they reduce assistance for child care for the low-",178
NA,"and middle-income families. They increase support for time off, but effectively reduce",178
NA,support for returning to work after parental leave.,178
NA,"They say they are open for business and they say they are about growth, but they",178
NA,"downgrade the growth figures, trash-talk the economy and cut the very things that make us",178
NA,"grow, including support for commercialisation, innovation, science and R&D.",178
NA,"They say they want to reduce debt, yet they happily increase family debt through student",178
NA,loans and brag about giving trade support loans to 16-year-olds who are still in school.,178
NA,"Apparently, government debt is bad but all other debt is good.",178
NA,"They say they are about small government, yet they abolish the bodies that bring state and",178
NA,federal responsibilities together and thus push the tasks back to be duplicated by eight,178
NA,governments. They make federal government smaller by making state and territory,178
NA,"governments bigger. Less cost for them, more for everybody else.",178
NA,"They say that we all have to do the heavy lifting, but poorer families carry the biggest",178
NA,burden and could lose up to 15 per cent of their disposable income in four years time. They,178
NA,"say they are about bringing the budget back under control, yet in question time in the last",178
NA,sitting week even the Treasurer acknowledged that the fiscal consolidation achieved in his,178
NA,first budget is less than that of previous Labor governments-a mere 1.1 per cent of GDP,178
NA,over three years-even compared with his own massaged MYEFO. Relative to what the,178
NA,Minister for Immigration and Border Protection confirmed were the last independent,178
NA,"projections in PEFO, the deficit is actually bigger over the forward estimates, not smaller.",178
NA,NA,178
NA,"They say they are about reducing debt, yet remarkably the budget fails to arrest the rise in",179
NA,"net government debt, which is forecast to be higher as a share of GDP in 2017-18 than it is",179
NA,"today. They say the budget had to be repaired, yet as a proportion of GDP they are a bigger",179
NA,spending government than Labor was in its previous three years. The spending of 24.6 per,179
NA,cent of GDP averaged over the last three years of Labor will rise to an average of 24.9 per,179
NA,"cent over the forward estimates and in 2017-18 will still be 24.8 per cent, which is higher than",179
NA,that of the last Labor government.,179
NA,"They say all the pain is about fiscal consolidation, but their own figures show it is fiscal",179
NA,"expansion, not consolidation. They say they are about reducing taxes, yet the tax-to-GDP ratio",179
NA,will rise from 21.4 per cent in the last full year of Labor to 23.2 per cent over the forward,179
NA,"estimates, making them a higher taxing government than any Labor government back to 1970.",179
NA,"They say it is tough love, but there is certainly no love-and, while it is tough on the",179
NA,"vulnerable and on lowand middle-income earners, they have made no discernible dent in the",179
NA,"bottom line. Tough love, but for what outcome? It is a budget of extraordinary contradictions.",179
NA,It is a budget of pain for no purpose. It is very much all pain and no gain.,179

Mr GOODENOUGH ,"Moore) (19:45): With 24,000 students, Edith Cowan University is",179
NA,"the cornerstone of the Joondalup Learning Precinct-a leader in the fields of research,",179
NA,innovation and enterprise initiatives. I acknowledge the exemplary work of Professor,179
NA,"Margaret Jones, Director of the Office of Research and Innovation, and Neil Butler,",179
NA,"Community Partnerships Adviser, in promoting three leading research institutes based on",179
NA,campus.,179
NA,ECU's Security Research Institute is one of the leading cybersecurity and digital forensic,179
NA,"groups in the world, recognised for its expertise in human, physical and aviation security. The",179
NA,"institute consistently delivers quality outcomes in computer and digital forensics, network and",179
NA,"wireless security, information warfare, physical security and risk management. The institute",179
NA,was recognised in 2009 by the Australian Computer Society as a centre of expertise in,179
NA,security. The group's other achievements include a digital forensics tool developed with the,179
NA,"WA Police to assist with cybercrime, preliminary crime scene investigation, disaster victim",179
NA,identification and evidence tracking.,179
NA,"Established in 2003, the university's Electron Science Research Institute has grown into a",179
NA,world leader in fundamental and applied research in nanophotonics and materials science.,179
NA,"Rapidly establishing a reputation for excellence in new functional materials, optoelectronics",179
NA,"and microfabrication research, the institute has worked with industry to develop a suite of",179
NA,"novel prototypes, including a multilaser optoelectronic plant identification sensor engine for",179
NA,the agri-bio industry; magneto-optic thin films of world record visible range performance; an,179
NA,"energy-producing transparent glazing system; and, most notably, 10 gigabit per second chip-",179
NA,"to-chip optical interconnects, which earned the institute's director, Kamal Alameh, the 2007",179

NA,NA,179
NA,innovation in health interventions has underpinned their achievements in cancer research.,180
NA,"Most notably, their multifaceted research program has been the direct result of work in",180
NA,"prostate cancer, enabling direct translation of their research findings into practical outcomes",180
NA,for patient benefit and the design and implementation of clinical and community based cancer,180
NA,survivorship programs.,180
NA,Research is supported by a high level of collaboration between cancer specialists with,180
NA,"distinguished international reputations in the fields of clinical exercise science, radiation",180
NA,"oncology, urology and molecular biology. Collaborative partnerships with leading clinicians",180
NA,"at several major metropolitan hospitals and universities, nationally and internationally, have",180
NA,expanded the pool of multidisciplinary expertise. During the past five years the institute has,180
NA,"recorded over 150,000 patient contacts. Ongoing research will further support the community,",180
NA,"with the institute examining the role of exercise in various areas, such as men receiving",180

NA,cancer and related lymphoedema; cancer patients with advanced bone metastatic disease;,180
NA,patients with lung cancer and mesothelioma; and depression in later life.,180
NA,"In summary, continued support, recognition and investment by the federal government will",180

NA,stronger economy.,180
NA,Autism,180
Ms CHESTERS ,Bendigo) (19:49): Tonight I share with the House a desperate plea for,180
NA,change from my community. Parents at Bendigo schools are calling for increased funding to,180
NA,help deal with the growing number of students with autism going through the mainstream,180
NA,schooling system.,180
NA,I will share with you a couple of local stories. A mother of a 12-year-old boy on the,180
NA,spectrum said that not enough is being done to cater for students with autism in our schools.,180
NA,"She said that her family has been through hell and back, fighting the education system to get",180
NA,the appropriate strategies in place so her son can cope with school. She does not blame the,180
NA,teachers but rather a lack of understanding about autism. She says that she knows her son can,180
NA,"misbehave and she is not saying that he is easy to deal with. But what he is going through, as",180
NA,"a young man, is just heartbreaking-and our system should be there to support him. Along the",180
NA,"way, Michelle has been told her expectations for her son are too high. But, she says:",180
NA,"To me this is ridiculous, because I have met police officers and solicitors with autism and, if they can",180
NA,"do it, it just proves that, with the right education balance, with funding within our system, anything is",180
NA,possible for these children.,180
NA,And Michelle is right.,180
NA,Many schools in my electorate have spoken out about not only the challenges but the,180
NA,benefits associated with having children with special needs in mainstream schooling.,180
NA,"Classroom aids, further special needs training for teachers and individual learning plans are",180
NA,just some of the areas that they say need extra funding to help students with autism in,180
NA,Bendigo. Most schools admit that a lack of government funding is putting a strain on their,180
NA,school and on their school budget-and they are right.,180
NA,NA,180
NA,"Camp Hill Primary School Assistant Principal, Chris Baker, said that whilst there are",181
NA,"challenges, children with autism are also helping to foster a greater understanding and",181
NA,"acceptance amongst the students. He said it can be really positive to have students, but he also",181
NA,said that they are lucky enough to have an autism coach funded by the education system. That,181
NA,is the problem. Schools should not have to be lucky to get the resources they need to support,181
NA,"the students. St Joseph's Primary School Principal, Nick Taggart, agrees that funding is",181
NA,creating problems but he said his school is doing what it can to ensure that everybody's needs,181
NA,are met. Nick is right. Funding continues to be a challenge at these schools. Every school,181
NA,"council, every principal, I met with has said there is a growing funding crisis in their budget",181
NA,to help students with autism in their school community.,181
NA,I have heard stories of students being locked up in principals' offices. I have heard stories,181
NA,of students being restrained because they have had a meltdown in the classroom. I have heard,181
NA,"stories of students being sent home after two hours of schooling, and students being left at",181
NA,"home and not being able to access main stream schooling, because they simply cannot find a",181
NA,school that will accept their child who has autism.,181
NA,This may be considered the pointy end of a system that is struggling. It is becoming an,181
NA,"increasing issue, with parents speaking to me in my office. Families with older children on the",181
NA,spectrum are finding that waiting lists are growing and that life is becoming increasingly hard,181
NA,"for their children. Further, specific funding required for students with autism is tightening,",181
NA,"meaning fewer students are benefiting. Quite often, if children are not diagnosed early",181
NA,"enough, they miss out on a package and then packages for older children are fewer and fewer.",181
NA,With five to 10 students with autism in most public and Catholic schools in the Bendigo,181
NA,"electorate, it reminds all of us of why we need Gonski and why the election promises broken",181
NA,on budget night-the trashing of Gonski-has really hurt the schools in Bendigo.,181
NA,Students with disabilities were forgotten on budget night. The government has broken its,181
NA,promise to students with a disability to deliver the Gonski loading for 2015. The budget failed,181
NA,"to outline any new funding for students with a disability. It is not fair that these students, their",181
NA,"families and schools, in Bendigo, go without. The community is fighting back, and I will fight",181
NA,with them.,181
NA,Foreign Policy,181
Dr HENDY ,Eden-Monaro) (19:55): I am rising today to make brief comments on some,181
NA,foreign policy issues. This week the Prime Minister returned from what I regard as a highly,181
NA,"successful overseas trip, involving visits to Indonesia, Europe, Canada and the United States.",181
NA,The first duty of any Australian government is to secure its borders and that means,181
NA,"ensuring strong defence capabilities and maintaining strong, constructive and stable",181
NA,international relations. The trip began with a visit to Batam Island to meet the Indonesian,181
NA,"president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The last government left Australia with a legacy of",181
NA,distrust vis-a-vis our relationship with Indonesia. The live-cattle export-ban fiasco was the,181
NA,"icon issue. However, there were other problems as well and the Prime Minister and Foreign",181
NA,Minister have had to do a lot of fence mending so that our relationship with our near,181
NA,"neighbour can get back onto an even keel. That was done in spades at this recent meeting, and",181
NA,the Prime Minister has gone a long way to getting it back on track.,181
NA,NA,181
NA,"From that series of meetings, the Prime Minister travelled to Europe to participate in the",182
NA,"anniversary celebrations for the D-day landings of 6 June 1944. Some 2,500 Australians,",182
NA,"mostly airmen, participated in that watershed event and 18 paid the ultimate sacrifice. The",182
NA,commemoration of the allies' triumph on D-day is also a significant part of Australia's history,182
NA,and the part we played in defeating Nazi and other fascist aggressors in the Second World,182
NA,War.,182
NA,The Prime Minister also took the opportunity to visit and pay respects at the grave sites,182
NA,related to the terrible battles of the Somme and the last days of World War I near Villers-,182
NA,Bretonneux. A number of years ago I also visited Villers-Bretonneux and attended the,182
NA,"magnificent but tremendously sad Australian war memorial, near the town. While in France,",182
NA,"the Prime Minister was able to have important meetings with the President of France,",182
NA,"Francois Hollande; the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel; and the Prime Minister of",182
NA,"Great Britain, David Cameron. They are the three principal leaders of the European Union",182
NA,"which, taken as a whole, is our biggest trading partner and the cultural beacon for the",182
NA,overwhelming majority of the Australian population.,182
NA,"From there, the Prime Minister had very warm and constructive meetings in Canada with",182
NA,"its Prime Minister, Stephen Harper. Amongst other things, Prime Minister Harper praised the",182
NA,Australian government's policy of abolishing the carbon tax. In the United States the Prime,182
NA,Minister's trip was a triumph. Not only did he have meetings with President Obama and other,182
NA,"senior figures in the administration-such as Treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, and Defence",182
NA,"Secretary, Chuck Hagel-but also he met key congressional leaders. For example, he met the",182
NA,"two most senior Democrat and Republican senators, respectively-Senator Harry Reid and",182
NA,Senator Mitch MCConnell. He also met the two principal leaders of the US House of,182
NA,"Representatives-Speaker John Boehner and Democrat Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi. He",182
NA,"also met the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, and the IMF managing director, Christine",182
NA,Lagarde.,182
NA,"The meetings with the President were very important and ranged over trade, defence,",182
NA,intelligence and energy-efficiency issues. The US complimented the Australian government,182
NA,on increased Defence spending in the recent budget and Australia reiterated its support for the,182
NA,US's ongoing 'pivot' to the Asia-Pacific. The issue of China was raised. As the Prime Minister,182
NA,"has said, we must welcome China's economic success. However, as I have previously noted,",182
NA,Australia must not resile from condemning any unilateral actions that jeopardise peaceful,182
NA,resolution of territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.,182
NA,"Equally, the talks covered the aggressive behaviour of Russia in the Ukraine. Again, this is",182
NA,an area where unilateral action has not been conducive to regional security. The Prime,182
NA,"Minister also discussed recent developments in Iraq, where Sunni militants are posing an",182
NA,increasing threat to regional security in the Middle-East. The President has said that barring,182
NA,putting troops on the ground no other options are off the table. The Prime Minister has noted,182
NA,that as a strong ally Australia is in close consultation with our US partners. Let us hope that,182
NA,military action can be avoided.,182
NA,"Deputy Speaker, this burgeoning crisis simply highlights the importance of our strategic",182
NA,"alliances and Australia's engagement in key world events, not least through our membership",182
NA,of the UN Security Council. It shows the Australian people that Defence and international,182
NA,relations are in safe and sure hands.,182

NA,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,184
NA,Isaacs Electorate: City of Greater Dandenong,184
Mr DREYFUS ,Isaacs-Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (09:30): I would like,184
NA,"to congratulate the City of Greater Dandenong, which last night in Parliament House was",184
NA,presented with the National Award for Local Government in the category of Multicultural,184
NA,Australia-Strength in Diversity. The National Awards for Local Government are an annual,184
NA,"celebration of Australian local government achievements. Through the awards, the Australian",184
NA,"government celebrates local government projects that are innovative, deliver better outcomes",184
NA,"for communities, have the potential to be rolled out across the country and make a meaningful",184
NA,"difference. In particular, I would like to congratulate Mayor Jim Memeti and Councillors",184
NA,"Youhorn Chea, Angela Long and Matthew Kirwan, who, together with Jackie Gatt, the",184
NA,"council's officer, were in Canberra to receive the award for the council's 'Racism. Get Up.",184
NA,Speak Out' program. It was a pleasure to see them all here.,184
NA,"At a council meeting on 26 June last year, the Greater Dandenong City Council",184
NA,unanimously pledged support for the National Anti-Racism Strategy's campaign 'Racism. It,184
NA,"Stops with Me.' The campaign, launched by the Australian Human Rights Commission in",184
NA,"2012, has been underpinned by key research findings which suggest that one in seven",184
NA,Australian says that they experience discrimination because of their colour or background;,184
NA,"approximately one in five Australians says they have experienced race hate talk, such as",184
NA,"verbal abuse, racial slurs or name calling; around one in 10 Australian says they have",184
NA,experienced race-based exclusions in the workplace or social events; and more than one in 20,184
NA,Australians says they have been physically attacked because of their race.,184
NA,"The campaign, embraced by the City of Greater Dandenong in the form of its 'Racism. Get",184
NA,"Up. Speak Out' program, aims to raise awareness about racism and its effect on individuals",184
NA,and communities; give individuals and organisations tools and resources to take practical,184
NA,actions against racism; and empower individuals and organisations. It was for this bold and,184
NA,innovative campaign that the council won its national award last night.,184
NA,"In addition, I note that, on 29 April this year, the City of Greater Dandenong made a formal",184
NA,submission opposing the Abbott government's attack on the provisions of the Racial,184
NA,"Discrimination Act, provisions that protect our communities against racist hate speech. I",184
NA,congratulate the council for emphatically rejecting Senator Brandis's view that 'people do,184
NA,"have a right to be bigots'. In its cover letter, the council said:",184
NA,"As a Victorian municipality with sixty per cent of residents born overseas, the City of Greater.",184
NA,Dandenong celebrates diversity and proactively seeks to address local racial discrimination. … Anti-,184
NA,racism is a matter of strong sentiment in this municipality.,184
NA,The council also pointed out:,184
NA,"Within Greater Dandenong, those most affected by this amendment would include Aboriginal and",184
NA,"Torres Strait Islanders, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and members of",184
NA,"certain religious groups, many of whom experience discrimination on a regular basis.",184
NA,NA,184
NA,I again congratulate the City of Greater Dandenong council for the local government award,185
NA,they won and for their strong opposition to the government's proposed changes.,185
NA,Dawson Electorate: Medical Workforce,185
Mr CHRISTENSEN ,Dawson-The Nationals Deputy Whip) (09:33): I rise to speak,185
NA,about the issue of doctor shortages in the Whitsundays. It seems strange that such a beautiful,185
NA,area and one of the greatest tourism destinations in the world cannot seem to attract enough,185
NA,"local GPs. But that is the situation, and I have spoken about the impact of this issue on several",185
NA,occasions in this place. Today I want to focus on some good news and suggest a better path,185
NA,for tomorrow.,185
NA,"The Whitsundays have now been declared a district of workforce shortage, which opens the",185
NA,door for foreign-trained doctors in the Whitsundays to apply for an exemption under section,185
NA,"19AB(3) of the Health Insurance Act 1973. As a result, we hope to see one of the doctors who",185
NA,"has left the region because of issues there, Dr Solgi, return to the Whitsundays with his wife,",185
NA,"Shiva, who is also a doctor. She had to leave because she was not allowed to work in the same",185
NA,practice with her husband because of the restrictions that will now be removed because of this,185
NA,"DWS declaration. As I said have said, they have not been able to do that because of the",185
NA,"restrictions in the act, restrictions which could only have been overcome with this DWS. So",185
NA,the declaration is welcome for the overworked doctors currently operating in the Whitsundays,185
NA,and for the residents who need and deserve proper health care.,185
NA,But I do question the process by which these declarations were made. I note the,185
NA,"Department of Health website outlines the information used in making these determinations,",185
NA,including:,185
NA,"The latest Medicare billing statistics, which account for all active Medicare billing and therefore give an",185
NA,accurate indication of the geographic distribution of doctors across Australia …,185
NA,I am afraid that does not give an accurate indication at all. The data is converted into full-time,185
NA,"equivalent doctors to work out a ratio, which caters for many doctors working part time but",185
NA,"does not account for few doctors working far too many hours. Dr El-Baky, from 121 Medical",185
NA,"Centre in the Whitsundays, advised me yesterday that his practice had 30,786 patients on the",185
NA,"books, cared for by himself and two part-time GPs. That figure only includes patients who",185
NA,"have presented in the past two years, which suggests the formula is not working in the real",185
NA,world.,185
NA,"The department's second source of information is ABS census data, which is supposed to",185
NA,"give an indication of the geographic distribution of the Australian population. That census, a",185
NA,"snapshot in time, is a poor indication of how many people are in need of a doctor in an area",185
NA,"where tourism is the biggest, and almost only, industry. International tourists get sick, but",185
NA,"they are not covered by Medicare. In the Whitsundays, with only a small resident population,",185
NA,"they see 600,000 interstate visitors a year. If 10 per cent of those visitors need to see a doctor",185
NA,"on their holidays, that is an extra 60,000 patients. The Whitsundays see a high turnover of",185
NA,"doctors at the Proserpine Hospital, and, with their Medicare provider numbers attached to the",185
NA,"region, it creates an impression that there are a lot more GPs then there actually are. So this",185
NA,flawed data does not account for the reality. I think the system needs to be reviewed or the,185
NA,minister given power to intervene. (Time expired),185
NA,NA,185
NA,Domestic Violence,186
Mr WATTS ,Gellibrand) (09:36): I rise to speak again in this place about the stain of,186
NA,"men's violence against women, and family violence more generally in our community. It has",186
NA,"been just over one month since I last spoke about family violence in this place, after the",186
NA,community of Sunshine in my electorate was shaken by the murder of Fiona Warzywoda.,186
NA,"While the media headlines have abated, it is important that we do not forget the ongoing",186
NA,"scourge of family violence in our community, that we do not forget that what White Ribbon",186
NA,"calls the 'dark secret of Australian society' still lingers silently in the homes of our family, our",186
NA,friends and our neighbours across the country.,186
NA,"Extrapolated from 2013 data, since I last spoke in this place there would have been at least",186
NA,"5,000 further incidents of family violence in Victoria. There would have been over 1,000",186
NA,"breaches of intervention orders, where we have failed to protect those in our society who most",186
NA,"need it. Given that incidents of family violence in Victoria continue to rise, these",186
NA,extrapolations are likely to be conservative. Community legal centres in Victoria have,186
NA,reported that family violence currently accounts for over 50 per cent of the work of their,186
NA,"lawyers. This is particularly true for Melbourne's west, where services addressing family",186
NA,violence have noticed a 35 per cent rise in demand for their services in recent years.,186
NA,"This debate is one that is too important to let slip from yesterday's headlines into obscurity,",186
NA,"into the file of problems often acknowledged but rarely acted upon. That is why, with other",186
NA,"members in Melbourne's west, I am organising a forum with members of our local",186
NA,communities and stakeholder groups to ensure that the issue is firmly kept on the agenda. We,186
NA,"are talking to the communities of Hobsons Bay, Brimbank, Maribyrnong and Wyndham to",186
NA,share ideas and to coordinate a response so that we know what is needed to prevent the,186
NA,incidence of family violence in Melbourne's west from rising any further.,186
NA,"That is why I welcome the announcement by the Victorian Leader of the Opposition,",186
NA,"Daniel Andrews, to create a royal commission into domestic violence under a future Andrews",186
NA,government in Victoria. This announcement was one that brought tears to the eyes of victims,186
NA,of domestic violence in Victoria. It is an acknowledgement that a holistic response to family,186
NA,"violence is required, ranging across health, housing, education, employment, policing, justice",186
NA,and our community services. But it is also an acknowledgement that a government response,186
NA,"must be given the highest possible priority by government, to ensure that change will be both",186
NA,effective and permanent. Daniel Andrews should be commended for having such bold vision,186
NA,"on this issue, and his leadership should be supported by all of us at the federal level.",186
NA,I speak today to reaffirm that family violence must stay on Australia's national political,186
NA,agenda. Long after the headlines have died down and the crowds of mourners from the latest,186
NA,"tragedy have dissipated, there are still family members who are piecing their lives together",186
NA,"after the loss of a mother, a sister, an aunt or a daughter. It is for them, and for all the women",186
NA,"and girls in our society, that we must make sure that efforts to address domestic violence do",186
NA,not abate. We must do all that we can to ensure that the light of political attention remains on,186
NA,the dark secret of family violence in our society.,186
NA,Battle of Cocos,186
Mr SIMPKINS ,Cowan) (09:39): I welcome the opportunity to speak today on an issue,186
NA,"that I am sure you are very keen on as well, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. We are rapidly",186
NA,NA,186
NA,approaching the 100th anniversary of the declaration of war for World War I. In the early,187
NA,"months of the war, in 1914, a very important battle took place, which we should keep in our",187
NA,"minds, particularly those of us from Western Australia, although it took place a fair distance",187
NA,"off our shores. I refer to the engagement between the HMAS Sydney, a light cruiser, and the",187
NA,German cruiser the SMS Emden.,187
NA,"At the start of the war, the German East Asia Squadron were ordered back to Germany to",187
NA,"act in Europe. They left behind the Emden, which was going to act as a commerce raider. In",187
NA,"the first two months of the Emden operating independently, some 25 ships were sunk in the",187
NA,"region, and others were damaged. At one point, on 8 November 1914, the captain of the",187
NA,"Emden, Karl von Mueller, decided that they would disable the Australian transmission station",187
NA,on Direction Island in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands group. Just before a landing party of about,187
NA,"50 troops were able to achieve that, a distress signal was sent out. It was very fortunate that",187
NA,"the convoy of the first Australian troops on their way to Egypt, accompanied by the HMAS",187
NA,"Sydney, was nearby, and Sydney was able to be dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.",187
NA,"At 9.15 on the morning of 9 November 1914, Emden was engaged by the Sydney. It was",187
NA,disabled by the Sydney and later in the morning surrendered. It was a great win for the,187
NA,"Australian Navy. Whilst 160-odd Germans were killed, four Australians were killed and 16",187
NA,were injured on the Sydney. It was the first real win of the Australian armed forces in World,187
NA,"War I. On 8 and 9 November this year, on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, there will be a great",187
NA,commemoration of this most important event in Australian military history.,187
NA,Bendigo Electorate: Kalydeco,187
Ms CHESTERS ,Bendigo) (09:42): I rise today to raise the case of two constituents,187
NA,living in my electorate-27-year-old Brett Bell and six-year-old Amelia MCCrohan-and,187
NA,their families. Both Brett and Amelia have a rare form of cystic fibrosis. Both spoke to me,187
NA,about their wishes and their calls on the government to work with the manufacturer of the,187
NA,very important life-saving drug Kalydeco. Kalydeco was listed on the PBS in November last,187
NA,"year, but it was listed with quite strict recommendations. Because of those recommendations,",187
NA,it is still not available in this country. I support the calls for the government to reinvest,187
NA,funding that has been made available through price disclosure in the PBS. This funding that,187
NA,has been made available to the government through price disclosure should go towards,187
NA,funding new medicines such as Kalydeco.,187
NA,Kalydeco does radically change people's lives. That has been demonstrated in the United,187
NA,States and countries in Europe. All Amelia and Brett are calling for is for Australia to have,187
NA,the same requirements for the drug Kalydeco as those countries do. What does it mean for,187
NA,"young Amelia, who is six years old? This drug could mean, if she starts taking it now, that she",187
NA,"could live life like a normal six-year-old and could go on to live a long life. Right now, the",187
NA,"life expectancy for someone with cystic fibrosis is low. For some, it is to their early teens. For",187
NA,"some, it is to their late 20s. That is it. They have a life where, once they hit their late teens,",187
NA,they start to get quite ill. It must be so frustrating for Amelia's parents to know that there is a,187
NA,drug available in other countries that could help their little girl. All they want is for her to live,187
NA,a good life. Knowing that this drug is available in other countries and not in Australia is quite,187
NA,"frustrating for them. So I call on the health minister, Peter Dutton, to work with Vertex and",187
NA,PBAC to avoid getting bogged down in price negotiations and bring about the listing and,187
NA,NA,187
NA,delivery of this drug Kalydeco so that the sufferers of this particular form of cystic fibrosis,188
NA,can receive the support that they need.,188
NA,Bradfield Electorate: 40K Foundation,188
Mr FLETCHER ,Bradfield-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,188
NA,Communications) (09:45): I am pleased to rise to pay tribute to the impressive work of the,188
NA,"40K Foundation, an organisation which was established by a man named Clary Castrission,",188
NA,who grew up in my electorate of Bradfield. Just a few weeks ago I was able to attend an event,188
NA,held at the home of Dr Rick and Amanda Porter in Gordon in my electorate where there was a,188
NA,briefing provided to supporters of the work of the 40K Foundation.,188
NA,This extraordinary organisation was conceived of by a group of young Australians and was,188
NA,triggered by a visit that some of them took to India. They were struck by the poverty that they,188
NA,"came across there and, with the enthusiasm of youth, they decided they would fund the",188
NA,"construction of a new school. In fact, they came up with the name 40K because they estimated",188
NA,"that building the school would cost $40,000. The school has been built in a community",188
NA,outside of Bangalore. It ended up costing some 10 times more than their initial estimate but is,188
NA,now operational and serves over 200 children. It is called the Banyan school.,188
NA,The work of Clary Castrission and the other young Australians involved in the 40K,188
NA,Foundation in achieving this is really quite remarkable. But they have not stopped there. They,188
NA,are evolving what they are doing towards being a social enterprise which works to deliver,188
NA,educational opportunities to children in India who otherwise would not get them. Their,188
NA,current model is to deliver teaching in English and mathematics into a range of villages in,188
NA,India. They use tablet computers to deliver the education. They have a model where they find,188
NA,somebody in each village who can help with the administration but who does not do the,188
NA,teaching because the teaching is provided by the device and by the children teaching,188
NA,themselves.,188
NA,The other thing they do is charge a small amount to parents for children to have this,188
NA,educational opportunity because they want to provide something that is sufficiently valued by,188
NA,the parents that they will pay a small but material amount for the education of these children.,188
NA,"It is a very impressive venture conceived by a group of young Australians, many of them",188
NA,"from my electorate of Bradfield, that began as a purely charitable operation. It is evolving into",188
NA,a sustainable social enterprise applying business principles to address a social problem-in,188
NA,this case children in India not getting the education that would change their lives. It aims to,188
NA,provide that education for a tangible and significant number of children.,188
NA,Kennedy Electorate: Ethanol,188
Mr KATTER ,Kennedy) (09:48): I rise to give notice that the little tiny party that I,188
NA,represent will be moving in the state parliament in Queensland for the introduction of ethanol.,188
NA,We will be moving exactly the same legislation that was moved by the LNP when they were,188
NA,in opposition in Queensland. So in opposition they were all for ethanol but when they get into,188
NA,government they are against it-a rather fascinating proposition. It could only be termed,188
NA,cowardice and betrayal of your electorate if you say that you are for it and get up and give all,188
NA,the speeches. Our state leader has informed me that he will be standing up and giving the,188
NA,"same speech that was given by the LNP spokesman when he was moving the legislation,",188
NA,when he was in opposition.,188
NA,NA,188
NA,"But for an exercise in arch hypocrisy, I can assure the members of parliament representing",189
NA,"ethanol areas that every one of their newspapers will be carrying an article saying: 'Are you,",189
NA,"Mr Member of Parliament, going to vote for this legislation or not?' It is over to you. You",189
NA,have a state election on in five or six months time and let all the people know.,189
NA,"Why is this so relevant, particularly in the sugar industry areas and in the area of Dalby?",189
NA,"Because, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the sugar industry we get $420 a",189
NA,tonne if it goes into an ethanol stream; we only get $320 a tonne if it goes into a sugar stream.,189
NA,These figures are all available because the government has just completed the $2.5 million,189
NA,"study, the Pentland Project-announced last week. It is the government's own figures I am",189
NA,quoting here.,189
NA,Why is every country on earth on ethanol? Every single one of the European Union,189
NA,countries signed up for 15 per cent. These places are all on ethanol: India; China; Indonesia;,189
NA,"Thailand; Philippines; all of the Americas, with the exception of Venezuela; all of Central",189
NA,America; all of the North American countries; all of the South American countries. The entire,189
NA,world is on ethanol except for the oil producing countries and Africa and Australia. Why are,189
NA,they all doing it? The reason they are doing it is in this report. (Time expired),189
NA,Aston Electorate: Roads,189
Mr TUDGE ,Aston-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:52): Traffic,189
NA,"congestion in Melbourne, and in my electorate particularly, is getting worse every year. We",189
NA,"all know the situation of being stuck in traffic, looking at the cars in front of us and feeling as",189
NA,"if we are not moving anywhere. This clearly has a social impact on families, because it means",189
NA,time away from home. But it also has an economic impact. It is estimated that traffic,189
NA,congestion in Melbourne costs $2.7 billion and that will rise to about $6 billion by 2020 if,189
NA,ameliorating action is not taken.,189
NA,"Fortunately, action is being taken at both state and federal levels. I would like to take this",189
NA,opportunity to outline some of the initiatives which will particularly impact residents in my,189
NA,"electorate. Residents of my electorate, like other outer suburban electorates, are particularly",189
NA,"impacted because a lot of the population growth is in those areas, and because there are so",189
NA,few other public transport options.,189
NA,The first initiative I would like to mention is the East West Link. We have now put in,189
NA,"through the federal budget an extra $1.5 billion, bringing the total contribution to $3 billion",189
NA,towards the East West Link. That will take not only pressure off the Eastern Freeway and,189
NA,provide routes across to the western parts of Melbourne; it will also take pressure off the,189
NA,Monash Freeway which so many of constituents in the southern parts of my electorate use.,189
NA,"Secondly, I want to mention a few local roads that I have made commitments to fight for. I",189
NA,would like to update the House on those. I will begin with Napoleon Road. That is one that,189
NA,"has been badly in need of an upgrade. I am pleased to report that the budget allocated $81,900",189
NA,in black spot funding to make significant improvements and add four turning lanes to,189
NA,"Napoleon Road, which will increase the safety and amenity of that road. I would further like",189
NA,to suggest that Police Road needs to be extended through to Churchill Park Drive. I,189
NA,mentioned this during the campaign and I have begun some discussions in relation to this. It is,189
NA,a difficult and complex problem because there are so many stakeholders-different councils,189
NA,NA,189
NA,and various levels of government are involved-but it is something we need to progress in,190
NA,order to take pressure off Bergins Road.,190
NA,I continue to press for the most dangerous part of the Stud Road bus lane to be removed-,190
NA,"between the Burwood Highway and Boronia Road. And, finally, I continue to press for the",190
NA,"Rowville rail, which is a project that is badly overdue. Fortunately, we now have the",190
NA,"feasibility study-the first and second stages-in, and progress is being made.",190
NA,South Australia,190
Ms RISHWORTH ,Kingston) (09:55): I rise today to talk about an issue that is of great,190
NA,concern to me. I am pleased that I have been joined by my South Australian colleagues here,190
NA,"in the chamber, because I know it is of deep concern to them. My concern is about this",190
NA,government's lack of vision for jobs in South Australia. This government has shown a,190
NA,complete contempt for South Australia and for the jobs in our state.,190
NA,It should be no surprise that in this budget there is no new money for jobs. You only have,190
NA,to look back at how this government has approached South Australian jobs to see how they,190
NA,abandoned Holden and the car manufacturing industry in South Australia. This government,190
NA,abandoned not only Holden but every single one of the component manufacturers in South,190
NA,"Australia, with a token effort of $20 million to try and help component manufacturers adjust.",190
NA,That is not enough money to help with the many thousands of jobs in auto components,190
NA,manufacturing.,190
NA,"In addition, this budget contains more cuts to jobs, which does not fill South Australians",190
NA,with any confidence. In the budget it was announced that 140 people who work in the Health,190
NA,"Workforce Australia in South Australia will have their jobs cut. Indeed, people are being",190
NA,made redundant as we speak.,190
NA,The jobs of some of our top military scientists and engineers based at the Defence Science,190
NA,and Technology Organisation in Adelaide are being cut. Many jobs are now at risk. We also,190
NA,need to add this government's decision not to commit to building ships in Australia. The,190
NA,government is not committing to the 12 submarines which are so critically important to jobs,190
NA,"in South Australia. That puts at risk the jobs of approximately 1,100 workers currently",190
NA,working at ASC in Adelaide; it also puts at risk potential future jobs-the jobs that could,190
NA,come from a boom in submarine building in South Australia.,190
NA,This government has shown contempt for South Australia and for jobs. I am appalled. I am,190
NA,glad the minister has just come into the chamber because I call on the government to seriously,190
NA,consider the impact that their decisions and this budget is having on jobs in South Australia,190
NA,and on future jobs in South Australia.,190
NA,This government is telling young people to either earn or learn. Where is their industry,190
NA,plan to ensure that jobs in South Australia grow? Where is their plan for future manufacturing,190
NA,in South Australia?,190
NA,"The South Australian government is taking the lead on this, and I call on the federal",190
NA,government to be upfront and to partner with the South Australian government and the South,190
NA,Australian people to promote manufacturing and jobs in South Australia. Please do not,190
NA,abandon South Australia in their time of need.,190
NA,NA,190
NA,Surf Life Saving Central Coast,191
NA,"Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (09:58): Today, I rise to acknowledge the incredible work done",191
NA,by thousands of lifesavers right across the Central Coast community. There are 15 clubs on,191
NA,"the coast, including eight in my electorate of Robertson, and they form an army of red-and-",191
NA,"yellow volunteers, who, in the past 75 years, have helped to make the Central Coast beaches",191
NA,"among the safest in the world. Lifesaving on the Central Coast has been around for 68 years,",191
NA,now.,191
NA,I was delighted to learn of this season's statistics from Surf Life Saving Central Coast: 956,191
NA,"lives saved, 37,322 preventative actions taken, more than 1,000 first aid cases, and no lives",191
NA,"lost. There are more than 8,000 members on the coast, with 2,000 patrolling the sand and the",191
NA,"water for around 94,000 hours every season. Every single member is deserving of praise but",191
NA,today I want to make mention of a number who received awards at the Central Coast's Life,191
NA,"Saving Awards of Excellence on Saturday night. They include Robert Powell from Umina,",191
NA,"Assessor of the Year; Jane Davis from Ocean Beach, for Trainer of the Year; Lynn Smith,",191
NA,"who won the Administrator Award; and Peter Lambeth, who received the Lifesaver of the",191
NA,Year Award.,191
NA,The Ocean Beach club also won the patrol championships and first aid awards. Avoca,191
NA,"Beach had two major winners: Damien Benson, Coach of the Year, and Kevin Bootle, who",191
NA,"collected the President's Award. From Terrigal, Cath Wilson won the award for SurfCom",191
NA,"Operators, Tim Schofield was Open Athlete of the Year and Paul Lemmon was Masters",191
NA,Athlete. Junior Lifesavers of the Year were Jackson Heinze from Terrigal and Jasmine,191
NA,"Darwin, who is based at Umina Surf Life Saving Club. They are both outstanding young",191
NA,"people of our future. Champion Lifesaver awards were given to Jemma Smith, Teigan Miller",191
NA,"and Jack Waining from Umina; and Jason, Jordan and Shelley Smith from Ocean Beach. The",191
NA,"overall point score for the Champion Lifesaver Award went to Avoca, and Umina won Club",191
NA,"of the Year. Special mention must be made of the President of Surf Life Saving Central Coast,",191
NA,"Stuart Harvey, CEO Chris Parker and also Marie Ward and Jonathan Donnelly for their hard",191
NA,work and support for our community.,191
NA,"In relation to the Terrigal club, I declare an interest. My husband and I have recently joined",191
NA,and we were honoured to complete the bronze medallion a couple of months ago. We have,191
NA,"joined a patrol and, I have to say, it is one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. The",191
NA,sense of teamwork and connection and desire to make a difference is something that really,191
NA,binds the surf-lifesaving volunteer community together.,191
NA,"Volunteers on the Central Coast beaches and, indeed, in New South Wales and right",191
NA,"around Australia give of themselves tirelessly, week after week, month after month, year after",191
NA,"year, with one aim in mind: to keep our local residents safe, to keep our beaches safe and to",191
NA,keep the thousands of tourists who visit the Central Coast safe in the water over summer and,191
NA,on the weekends. Today I pay tribute to all of our surf-lifesaving volunteers for what has to be,191
NA,one of the most honourable roles you can have-that of seeking to serve and to save lives.,191
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. BC Scott): Order! In accordance with standing order,191
NA,193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.,191

NA,BILLS,192
NA,Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015,192
NA,Consideration in Detail,192
NA,Industry Portfolio,192
NA,"Proposed expenditure, $4,202,817,000",192
NA,Debate resumed.,192
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:01): Thank you for this,192
NA,"opportunity to discuss the substantial, significant budget for Australian industry. This budget",192
NA,"sets out a policy framework for Australian industry, manufacturing, energy and resources,",192
NA,"skills and training, and science not just for the forward years but for the decades ahead. It sets",192
NA,"a clear path to sustainability, new investment and jobs growth, and provides new",192
NA,opportunities in markets for Australian ideas and products. Our approach underpins a new era,192
NA,"for Australia which faces up to our challenges, embraces our strengths and accepts our",192
NA,responsibility for forging a new direction. We have the opportunity to reposition Australian,192
NA,"industry towards the jobs and sectors of the future, while increasing the opportunity to",192
NA,advance value-adding manufacturing. This future will be built around new ways of sharing,192
NA,"knowledge and know-how and greater links-I emphasise: greater links-between science,",192
NA,"research and industry itself. In fact, we will be putting science and research at the centre of the",192
NA,Industry portfolio.,192
NA,This budget represents the hard work of a government that will not shirk its responsibility,192
NA,to restore the nation's finances after Labor's debt and deficit disaster of the last six years; but it,192
NA,is also a budget that signals a clear new direction for Australian industry towards a future of,192
NA,"new opportunities, new markets, new jobs and a new era of confidence in our ability and",192
NA,"integrity. We have made it clear that no longer will industry policy be based around handouts,",192
NA,bandaid solutions and throwing around taxpayers' money willy-nilly without any strategic,192
NA,focus or long-term benefit to the nation.,192
NA,Australian businesses are characterised by a world-class standard of entrepreneurship. We,192
NA,have a stellar record of sparking great ideas and turning those great ideas into real-world,192
NA,applications. We do our Australian businesses a great disservice if we advocate a handout or,192
NA,government led-mentality. The government's role is to create the right policy framework and,192
NA,"settings to unleash the creativity, ingenuity and practicality of Australians and their",192
NA,"businesses. We have a role as a government to be the catalyst, not the gatekeeper.",192
NA,We are investing in national productivity gains and skilled workers of the future through a,192
NA,$1.9 billion Trade Support Loans scheme which will encourage apprentices to take up a trade,192
NA,"but, far more importantly, to finish that trade. Fifty per cent completion rates are simply not",192
NA,"acceptable, particularly for young people who need a future that is secure with the training",192
NA,they need. We want to turn out people who can take real jobs and have a secure future. We are,192
NA,putting in place a skills and training network that delivers the trained workers that Australian,192
NA,"businesses are calling out for, not simply training young people for the sake of training.",192
NA,"As I mentioned, the government will be putting science and research at the centre of",192
NA,"industry policy, and we are developing a strategic approach to science policy which will adopt",192
NA,a whole-of-government outlook to ensure that all portfolios work together to focus on our,192
NA,NA,192
NA,"resources and delivering future jobs. That is all portfolios of government, not just my own",193
NA,very diverse portfolio.,193
NA,"The budget includes an investment of $1.4 billion in the resource sector, centred around the",193
NA,"$100 million exploration development incentive, which is otherwise known as a flow-through",193
NA,"shares scheme, something the Labor Party promised but in six years of government never",193
NA,delivered. We want to make it crystal clear that we support the energy and resources sector. It,193
NA,"is one of our economy's most significant job drivers, and the private sector investment and",193
NA,national revenue of our country depends on it.,193
NA,"Beyond the big headlines, of course, we also want to support our communities by getting",193
NA,"rid of the carbon tax, the mining tax and red and green tape. We want to stop the constant tax",193
NA,grabs we saw from those opposite during their time in government that attacked the resources,193
NA,"sector as if it were an ATM, never giving it any credit or security for its future. Our",193
NA,"government is about forging new links between industry research and science, and that is",193
NA,exactly what we will do.,193
Mr GRAY ,Brand) (10:06): I thank the minister for his introductory comments. The,193
NA,"partnership between resources and science is important, and in Australia we are blessed with",193
NA,some of the great institutions that do support the interaction of science and our resources,193
NA,"sector. The most important of those, we believe, is Geoscience Australia. I ask the minister to",193
NA,outline to the House the impact of the budget cuts on Geoscience Australia and its interactions,193
NA,with its counterpart organisations in the states and territories.,193
NA,Geoscience Australia provides a significant body of precompetitive data that helps inform,193
NA,"explorers and the industry on the prospectivity and, most importantly, helps to drive the",193
NA,exploration sector in the most meaningful possible way. The discovery of the Gawler Craton,193
NA,"occurred out of the PACE program in South Australia, which grew out of the insights that",193
NA,have grown from Geoscience Australia. Geoscience Australia's role in supporting science in,193
NA,understanding the interaction of water and coal gas extraction is something in which our,193
NA,community has a great deal of confidence. Geoscience is not simply a Canberra based,193
NA,organisation. It is a world-leading organisation that has been consistently supported by,193
NA,"successive governments, so I am enthusiastic to understand the minister's views and intent",193
NA,behind the cuts to Geoscience Australia.,193
NA,We also have in our country at the moment a significant and growing issue on the east,193
NA,"coast, and that is gas supply-the extraction of gas from coal seams to support the domestic",193
NA,gas supply needs of the east coast. I would like to know from the minister what the,193
NA,Commonwealth is doing to assist that industry to grow. We hear many poorly-thought-,193
NA,through arguments that associate the export gas industry with increasing prices on the east,193
NA,"coast. We know our gas prices are being internationalised, but the renovating impact of that",193
NA,"LNG investment, in particular in the minister's home state of Queensland, has had a",193
NA,significantly beneficial impact on gas supply. But there are clouds over how advantageous,193
NA,that resource could be for Australia and the lack of willingness in some jurisdictions to see,193
NA,that gas extracted in a safe way. I stress the word 'safe' because that relates organically to my,193
NA,previous question about Geoscience Australia.,193
NA,These things are connected not just by ideas but they are connected organically-the foot,193
NA,"bone connects to the shin bone connects to the knee bone. Good science, through Geoscience",193
NA,"Australia, gives our community confidence that we know what we are doing. Good science",193
NA,NA,193
NA,underpins community confidence that gas extracted from coal seams can be done in the best,194
NA,possible way. On this side of the House we strongly stand for good science not as a dalliance,194
NA,but for good science underpinning good industrial and environmental management practices.,194
NA,I would like to hear from the minister specifically about the cuts to Geoscience Australia-,194
NA,how those cuts will improve the operation of Geoscience Australia; and the measures that the,194
NA,government will practically take to assist increased gas recovery from the east coast into our,194
NA,pipeline network in the east coast to drive our domestic markets?,194
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:11): Can I thank the,194
NA,member for Brand for his questions and also of course for his contributions when the Labor,194
NA,Party was last in government towards supporting the resource sector. He was at times a lone,194
NA,voice there but he punched well above his weight. So I thank him for that. He gave the,194
NA,"resources sector some glimmer of hope in what was a very bleak time for them when, as I say,",194
NA,the Labor Party treated the resource sector as a punching bag and source of money or an ATM,194
NA,whenever they ran short.,194
NA,"In answer to his specific question in relation to Geoscience Australia, as the member for",194
NA,"Brand knows, I am a great supporter of Geoscience Australia-and he was when he was",194
NA,"minister and Martin Ferguson before him. We have moved to ensure that, in terms of their",194
NA,"long-term appropriations, they have a very secure and solid future. I will confirm, however,",194
NA,that there was a $27-million reduction under section 31 funding from $62 million in the 2013-,194
NA,14 budget to $35 million in 2014-15. There was also a $1.937-million efficiency dividend,194
NA,imposed on Geoscience Australia.,194
NA,"More to the question, though, we do not expect there to be any long-term impact on",194
NA,"Geoscience Australia. There have been some voluntary redundancies that have been taken,",194
NA,"but as part of the overall efficiency which we need to achieve from our departments,",194
NA,Geoscience Australia is certainly able to assist in that regard. I have total confidence that,194
NA,Geoscience Australia has the resources it needs to do the job that Australia needs it to do. It is,194
NA,"a pre-eminent organisation globally, it is well respected internationally and we certainly need",194
NA,to make sure that it continues to do that work.,194
NA,"In regard to coal seam gas and the way that industry is progressing in eastern Australia, I",194
NA,have played an active role in trying to assist that industry to overcome some of the myths and,194
NA,"blatant lies that are spoken about it. Along, as I say, with members from the opposition, we",194
NA,have from time to time needed to explain to our colleagues exactly what is going on in that,194
NA,"industry. It is an industry which has enormous potential. As you, Deputy Speaker Scott, know",194
NA,"more than anyone else in this parliament, it can bring about enormous beneficial change in the",194
NA,"communities it is involved in. In your electorate of Maranoa and in my electorate of Groom,",194
NA,we have seen 4½ thousand farmers sign up to coexistence agreements with coal seam gas,194
NA,operators. I will give an example of the impact of that for individual farmers. I am sure Peter,194
NA,"Thompson will not mind me mentioning his name again, or this number, which he stated in",194
NA,"public. One of the Deputy Speaker's constituents, Peter Thompson, and his wife, Nikki, have",194
NA,said publicly that they will receive $6 million from coal seam gas companies in return for,194
NA,allowing those companies to operate on their properties. The reality is that that $6 million is,194
NA,without any investment from the Thompsons or any requirement for the Thompsons to be,194
NA,involved in any work or labour or any risk in terms of capital investment. It is changing the,194
NA,whole economic and social landscape of that region.,194
NA,NA,194
NA,Farmers are cooperating and science is being heavily involved to ensure that the,195
NA,underground aquifers are not affected. The cooperation that has been going on between the,195
NA,"state government, the local governments, people like Ray Brown from the Western Downs",195
NA,"shire and, of course, the Commonwealth government has been exemplary. Unfortunately, that",195
NA,"is not the case in other states. At the moment, we are seeing a moratorium in Victoria. Perhaps",195
NA,"after the election, again with some encouragement from the Commonwealth government and",195
NA,"some assistance from both sides of the House federally, we can encourage some development",195
NA,in that regard. In New South Wales I am more pessimistic. I am unsure how we can progress,195
NA,"that issue. I have made a number of attempts, and I did, for a short time, consider a coal seam",195
NA,gas working group to assist there. But I have abandoned that idea.,195
NA,NA,195
NA,competitiveness by supporting business improvement and promoting economic growth,195
NA,through commercialisation of new ideas. I want to ask about the government's commitment to,195
NA,"industry policy-more specifically, the delivery of the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure",195
NA,"Program through a single business service initiative. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be",195
NA,"aware, unemployment in my region increased to over nine per cent under the previous Labor",195
NA,"government, during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. It is absolutely essential that we do things",195
NA,"to help the economy in the regions, so, Minister, I ask you to list the programs and the new",195
NA,initiatives that the coalition government is providing for industry to help drive,195
NA,"competitiveness and create jobs of the future. Also, focusing on the Entrepreneurs'",195
NA,"Infrastructure Program, would you tell me the rationale for the creation of this new and",195
NA,innovative program? What are the primary objectives and components of the program? How,195
NA,much funding will it receive? What progress is being made in the establishment of the EIP?,195
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:17): I thank the member,195
NA,"for Hinkler for his question. I know that, in the short nine months that he has been there, he",195
NA,has had an enormous impact in terms of encouraging new businesses and new industries to,195
NA,"that region. He has certainly ensured that businesses in Hinkler-or potentially in Hinkler, or",195
NA,if he can steal them from anywhere else-are aware that he is more than welcoming of new,195
NA,businesses in his electorate. He is making sure that the 'open for business' sign is well and,195
NA,truly illuminated both here and overseas.,195
NA,"In answering the member for Hinkler's questions, I will say how important it is that we",195
NA,continue to see businesses established and that we attract not only businesses from Australia,195
NA,"but also foreign investment. Innovation in Australia is a very, very high priority for this",195
NA,"government, as it was last time I held this portfolio, between 2001 and 2007. We want to",195
NA,invigorate people to commercialise their good ideas. A good idea is worth nothing until it is,195
NA,"turned into a commercial opportunity, until it is turned into a job opportunity for people-and,",195
NA,"in this case, the people of the seat of Hinkler in particular.",195
NA,"We are investing more than $2.25 billion in industry programs over the forward estimates,",195
NA,and this will deliver real outcomes and real jobs. We are certainly not abandoning the,195
NA,industries that those opposite would want you to believe we are. In terms of supporting,195
NA,"industries, we have stood behind industries, we are adjusting industries and we are offering",195
NA,industries new opportunities.,195
NA,"The range of programs to assist that innovation, create jobs and provide a streamlined and",195
NA,"focused approach to industry policy include, as the member mentioned: the Entrepreneurs'",195
NA,NA,195
NA,"Infrastructure Program, some $484 million manufacturing worth of funding; the",196
NA,"Manufacturing Transition Program, some $50 million worth of funding; the growth fund to",196
NA,"assist those involved in the auto industry to transition to new long-term jobs, a total of $155",196
NA,million of which the Commonwealth government contributed $101 million; the Prime,196
NA,"Minister's National Industry Investment and Competitiveness Agenda, which will be",196
NA,"announced in the months ahead; and the Industry Skills Fund, which, again, is a very",196
NA,important area in giving business the skills they need and their employees the skills they need,196
NA,"to be competitive in an evolving and developing industry framework, some $476 million.",196
NA,Some might say the Trade Support Loans is the jewel in the crown of the training support,196
NA,"area, some $1.9 billion of trade support loans. People wanting to do apprenticeships and",196
NA,"certain traineeships will be able to access loans of up to $20,000 interest-free and adjusted",196
NA,with CPI annually.,196
NA,The response from industry once we explained the Trade Support Loan scheme to them has,196
NA,been excellent. I was actually out in my electorate last Friday doing that and the response was,196
NA,overwhelmingly positive. The cost of providing those loans interest-free is around $480,196
NA,"million in the forward estimates. As well as that, we have got: the Geelong Region and",196
NA,"Melbourne North Investment Fund, some $54 million and we are well through that; the",196
NA,Tasmanian Investment Fund of $11 million; and the Automotive Transition Transformation,196
NA,"scheme for the auto industry, exclusively for the auto industry, some $550 million.",196
NA,"The member asked about the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program. The new program,",196
NA,"aimed at supporting the commercialisation of good ideas, establishes and delivers a",196
NA,"straightforward, proactive and effective approach to industry policy through a substantive and",196
NA,more efficient implementation platform which is known as the single business service. It will,196
NA,provide market and industry information and advice to business. It will offer business,196
NA,management advice and skills. Experienced private sector business advisers will give access,196
NA,to research and innovators to re-engineer business operations. It will also connect them to,196
NA,supply chains and potential markets as well as commercialisation advice.,196
Mr GRAY ,Brand) (10:23): Thank you for your observations about Geoscience Australia.,196
NA,Could I ask you to be more specific. You referenced almost $30 million in cuts to Geoscience,196
NA,"Australia. You may need to take this on notice, but just how many jobs have been axed in",196
NA,Geoscience Australia? What were the skills that were lost? What work areas have been,196
NA,affected? What is the ongoing program of graduate recruits into Geoscience Australia? These,196
NA,things are important as I know the minister would understand a healthy and vital Geoscience,196
NA,"Australia does require consideration of its structures, of its work programs and of its future",196
NA,skill base.,196
NA,I would also like to ask the minister about the review of the Renewable Energy Target.,196
NA,"Minister, we understand that review is taking place chaired by Mr Dick Warburton, a fine",196
NA,Australian and a very significant Australian business leader. I have had the pleasure of,196
NA,meeting with Mr Warburton to discuss that review. But if the minister as the Minister for,196
NA,Energy could advise the House on when we can expect the report of the review on the RET,196
NA,that would be great greatly appreciated. If a date and a time cannot be provided then at the,196
NA,very least give an indication of when we can expect that review to be presented because of the,196
NA,importance of the month of August and the casting of the renewable credit numbers for the,196
NA,next year.,196
NA,NA,196
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:24): I thank the member,197
NA,for Brand for his question. I will take parts of his question on notice. In terms of the specific,197
NA,"skills that have been removed, I will give the member for Brand the detail of that but I will",197
NA,"have to take that part of his question on notice, as I will the part on the graduate program. It is",197
NA,"my understanding that there is no effect on the graduate program, but I will supply him with",197
NA,further detail in regards to that.,197
NA,"In regards to the actual staff movements, as of 30 May 2014 62 staff have departed",197
NA,Geoscience Australia. By 30 June this year a total of 76 employees will have departed. By the,197
NA,end of December this year a total of 85 employees will have departed. Five employees have,197
NA,elected to seek redeployment and have commenced their retrenchment period. Nine staff have,197
NA,been offered voluntary redundancies and are yet to indicate their preference to exit or seek,197
NA,employment. Existing and projected average staffing levels at Geoscience Australia are 716 in,197
NA,"the year 2013-14 and 620 in the year 2014-15. As I said, though, I am entirely confident that",197
NA,there will be no effect on the capacity of Geoscience Australia.,197
NA,"In response to the member for Brand's question regarding the Renewable Energy Target, I",197
NA,take this opportunity to remind the House both of the coalition's commitment to renewable,197
NA,"energy and, more importantly, of the fact that we are the fathers of this scheme. We",197
NA,"established the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target. Senator Robert Hill, who was the",197
NA,"environment minister at the time, implemented this. It has given an enormous boost to the",197
NA,implementation of renewable energy in Australia. We have seen projects built around,197
NA,Australia off the back of the scheme. In terms of Australia's percentage of renewable energy,197
NA,"vis-a-vis the rest of the world, we can certainly hold our heads up.",197
NA,"In regards to the member for Brand's specific question about the review, he is quite right:",197
NA,Dick Warburton is an excellent choice as chairman as someone who has enormous respect in,197
NA,the business community as he has been involved in business a very long time and has been,197
NA,very successful at it. He and his equally as qualified committee are currently considering the,197
NA,impacts of the Renewable Energy Target on Australia's competitiveness and our ability to,197
NA,continue to maintain a target for renewable energy going forward. It is my understanding that,197
NA,the committee will release their modelling towards the end of this month and that they then,197
NA,"will work from that point to prepare the report for government, which we would expect to",197
NA,receive some time after that-perhaps in the next few months.,197
NA,I do not expect the government to be long in responding to that review. In terms of my own,197
NA,"time lines, I need to hand down an energy white paper this year. I need to be able to be",197
NA,"confident that, firstly, the Labor Party has seen the error of its ways-and it is still not too late",197
NA,yet-and will support the rescinding of the carbon tax. I need to see the carbon tax dealt with,197
NA,before I can have any forward concept on where energy policy is going in Australia.,197
NA,Hopefully that will occur in the next sitting of the Senate in early July. I also need to know,197
NA,where the government intends to set its policy in relation to renewable energy. We expect to,197
NA,"see a response to the renewable energy review sooner rather than later, perhaps by the third or",197
NA,fourth quarter of this year.,197
NA,NA,197
NA,Infrastructure Program. I want to ensure that the minister is aware of some of the absolutely,197
NA,valuable additions from the Hinkler electorate to manufacturing. We are the biggest producer,197
NA,of heavy vegetables in Australia. All of our agriculturalists know that farm gate returns are,197
NA,NA,197
NA,simply not high enough so we need those value-added products to increase not only,198
NA,"productivity but the return to our farmers to make them viable. Inside my electorate, Minister,",198
NA,we have opportunities for macadamias and sweet potatoes. We already have organisations,198
NA,"like Austchilli with David and Trent De Paoli. They are a major exporter of chilli, basil and",198
NA,avocado products all over the world. These secondary level manufacturers help our local,198
NA,producers.,198
NA,The other thing the minister may not be aware of is that the Bundaberg port is completely,198
NA,underutilised. The opportunities in Bundaberg and in the Hinkler electorate are quite simple.,198
NA,Land is cheap. We have lots of it. There is a lay-down area in Bundaberg as big as the,198
NA,"Brisbane port. We could build container ports, build industry or do anything but we need that",198
NA,seed funding to help those things along. Certainly it is low risk. We are below the Barrier,198
NA,Reef and are in a low cyclone risk area. There are opportunities there.,198
NA,"The Bundaberg Foundry, for example, located in Bundaberg just celebrated 125 years of",198
NA,manufacturing. It is still there but it is under pressure from the carbon tax and from red and,198
NA,"green tape. They are struggling. Electricity costs are up $1 million. Minister, if you can name",198
NA,"a foundry in Australia that is making $1 million a year, I would be very interested.",198
NA,"The Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program is incredibly important. Minister, further to my",198
NA,"last question on the government's commitment to industry policy and, more specifically, the",198
NA,delivery of the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program through the single business service,198
NA,"initiative, will you advise what the government is doing to ensure that there is smooth",198
NA,transition from the closure of existing programs to the launch of the new Entrepreneurs',198
NA,Infrastructure Program? Is there a date by which the program will be functioning? Is the,198
NA,"government on track to meet that date? How will businesses, particularly SMEs, interact and",198
NA,gain access to the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program-businesses like Hervey Bay,198
NA,"seafood and the Hervey Bay scallop, who could certainly do with an automated shucking",198
NA,machine even though something that would work functionally has not been built yet? How,198
NA,does this new initiative simplify the process for business to seek support? What has the,198
NA,reaction been from major stakeholders to this budget measure?,198
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:32): I again thank the,198
NA,member for Hinkler and say how impressed I am by the support he gives businesses in his,198
NA,electorate and his knowledge of the issues that they face. I have had the opportunity to visit,198
NA,"the city of Bundaberg on numerous occasions. In fact, I remember going there when I was",198
NA,"quite young and I remember my attraction to it when I was an older person-fortunately, I",198
NA,managed to break that habit and I do not drink Bundaberg Rum anymore. It is a great product,198
NA,and I certainly do not bemoan it. It has made Bundaberg very famous. The member for,198
NA,Hinkler asked me about the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program.,198
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,198
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE: I hear interjections from the other side about handouts. I think,198
NA,we need to be very clear about these programs and how they work. They work to give,198
NA,businesses a hand up and not a handout. I know the Labor Party are infamous for spraying,198
NA,money around with gay abandon and very little purpose. One of the great problems we have,198
NA,had since we took government is dealing with the bandaids they had applied to various,198
NA,industries. I can ask them what commitments and long-term benefits they achieved for the,198
NA,NA,198
NA,millions of dollars they gave to Alcoa or for the millions of dollars that they gave to GMH to,199
NA,stay in Australia.,199
NA,Our programs are specifically targeted at producing results. The government's decision to,199
NA,implement the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program took into consideration the existing,199
NA,status of all current programs that are planned to be phased out of operation. It was almost a,199
NA,"grab bag of programs, some of which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be shocked to know",199
NA,"actually never came into operation. Money was allocated, announcements were made,",199
NA,"launches were relaunched but nothing ever happened. I know, you, particularly, Deputy",199
NA,"Speaker Scott, would be shocked by that, knowing the value of money! The reality is, though,",199
NA,that we are going to ensure that there are well-targeted programs. To ensure that no business,199
NA,misses out this government has made provision for Commercialisation Australia to operate,199
NA,through until 31 December 2014 and deal with all applications formally lodged before the,199
NA,close of business in 2014.,199
NA,"Additionally, Enterprise Connect will run on a business-as-usual basis until the end of this",199
NA,current financial year and any smallto medium-business owners that were dealing with,199
NA,either Commercialisation Australia or Enterprise Connect will be able to be transferred across,199
NA,to the new Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program from early in the new financial year to,199
NA,ensure there is a seamless transition.,199
NA,The member for Hinkler asked me about the start-up dates in relation to the Entrepreneurs',199
NA,"Infrastructure Program. In line with 2014-15 budget commitments, the Entrepreneurs'",199
NA,Infrastructure Program will operate from 1 July 2014. Its interaction with SMEs and access by,199
NA,SMEs is very simple: business will be able to gain access and interact with the Entrepreneurs',199
NA,"Infrastructure Program in person, on the phone or via the internet or email. Throughout this",199
NA,month of June all details of the program will be placed on the Department of Industry's,199
NA,website.,199
NA,"I was asked how this program works in comparison to previous programs. The reality is, as",199
NA,"I have just mentioned, there was when we inherited government an overlapping plethora of",199
NA,small grants and entitlements that were not targeted towards any specific outcome. We are,199
NA,"sitting about getting the economic settings right, getting rid of red tape and equipping",199
NA,"business by giving them the market, information and skills they need. We must remember that",199
NA,"Labor's legacy is one of indecision and change. In the last three years, in fact, there were 14",199
NA,"ministers through the former Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science,",199
NA,Research and Tertiary Education-and you wonder why small business was glad to see them,199
NA,go.,199
Mr WATTS ,Gellibrand) (10:37): I have a number of questions for the minister about the,199
NA,impact of the budget on the auto manufacturing sector. I do thank the minister for inviting me,199
NA,to attend with him the Altona Toyota manufacturing plant in my electorate. I genuinely thank,199
NA,him for that. I am just regretful that future invitations will not be able to be extended for,199
NA,"members for Gellibrand, as the Toyota plant will be ceasing operations in future as a result of",199
NA,the actions of this government.,199
NA,A recent report from Adelaide University stated that Australia was expected to suffer a fall,199
NA,"in national employment of around 200,000 as a result of the planned closure of auto",199
NA,"manufacturing between now and 2017 and that the greatest job losses will be in Victoria, with",199
NA,"an estimated decline of close to 100,000 jobs. How can the minister justify over $1 billion in",199
NA,NA,199
NA,cuts to the automotive industry in the budget when the government is well aware that these,200
NA,cuts are putting hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs at risk?,200
NA,The automotive firms and component manufacturers have repeatedly advised the,200
NA,government of the serious consequences of cutting funding from the Automotive,200
NA,Transformation Scheme at what is an already difficult time for manufacturing and supply,200
NA,chain workers. So why is the government cutting over $900 million from the Automotive,200
NA,"Transformation Scheme when the minister is well aware that, if passed, these cuts will",200
NA,"intensify the financial pressure on the hundreds of firms in the supply chain, firms which have",200
NA,already factored ATS funding into their long-term business and investment decisions?,200
NA,"According to the Prime Minister's announcement, the government's so-called $155 million",200
NA,Growth Fund has been set up for firms and employees in South Australia and Victoria,200
NA,affected by the closure of local manufacturing operations. In April this year an independent,200
NA,"study projected that auto closures would result in over 32,000 jobs lost in New South Wales,",200
NA,"over 30,000 in Queensland, as well as over 11,000 in WA and almost 500 in the Northern",200
NA,"Territory. This is on top of the 23,000 jobs at risk in South Australia and almost 100,000 jobs",200
NA,in Victoria. Economic modelling forecasts a negative annual shock of $29 billion or more by,200
NA,2017.,200
NA,Can the industry minister please outline how this so-called growth fund will have any,200
NA,"chance of helping auto workers in New South Wales, Queensland, WA and the NT, not to",200
NA,"mention how, with just $100 million in Commonwealth funding, this program will have any",200
NA,"impact on the 200,000 jobs at risk on a national level.",200
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:39): I thank the member,200
NA,"for Gellibrand for his question and assure him that, if there are future opportunities-and",200
NA,"there should be between now and 2018-for visits to the Altona plant, I will invite him. He",200
NA,"did, after all, get the best start to life that anyone could get in Australia, by being born in",200
NA,"Toowoomba, and I am sure that, deep down somewhere, there is a lot more good that we can",200
NA,"make of that. His choice in politics may have been dubious, but I am sure his heart is made of",200
NA,gold.,200
NA,"Regarding decisions made by Australian car manufacturers to cease operation, I draw to",200
NA,point the member for Gellibrand's assertions that our government was in any way responsible,200
NA,"for those decisions, most particularly the decision of Toyota. Having known the Toyota",200
NA,"management for as long as I have, dating back to 2001, when I was the minister for industry",200
NA,"then, I can assure the member for Gellibrand that the government were given very clear",200
NA,"indication by Toyota that, in spite of everything we had done and would do, they had made",200
NA,"their decision to close. That decision was extremely difficult. The heads of Toyota, both here",200
NA,"in Australia and Japan, came up to Canberra especially to talk to me about that and to also",200
NA,"meet with the Prime Minister and explain that decision, but it is a simple fact that, in relation",200
NA,"to manufacturing cars in Australia, it is virtually impossible to compete. It needs to be",200
NA,"remembered, and perhaps lamented, that the industry arrived at the point under the previous",200
NA,"Labor government where it required $5,784 per vehicle, plus tariffs, to continue to operate in",200
NA,Australia.,200
NA,"I am an optimist. I have spent a lot of time in farming, where you have to be an optimist. In",200
NA,"fact, I was a farmer longer than I have been a politician. If I looked at a component of my",200
NA,"farming operation where taxpayers had to contribute that proportion, which is almost 15 and,",200
NA,NA,200
NA,"in some cases, 20 per cent of the value of the vehicle, I would say, 'There is no hope.'",201
NA,"Unfortunately, though, as I say, we lament it, there was no way in which Toyota, Holden,",201
NA,Ford and Mitsubishi-some of whom made those decisions when the Labor government was,201
NA,"in power, some of whom made them since we came to power, but the result is the same-",201
NA,"could continue. They all arrived at the same conclusion, and that was that the industry could",201
NA,"no longer manufacture vehicles in Australia without long-term, substantial government-",201
NA,"taxpayer funded subsidies. Unfortunately, because of the complete and absolute mess that the",201
NA,"Labor Party left the finances in, the money that we would be paying the auto industry would",201
NA,"have to be borrowed by taxpayers from overseas, and that is just sheer insanity. So, whilst we",201
NA,"lament that the car industry has made those decisions, we as pragmatic, rational people",201
NA,understand why it made those decisions.,201
NA,To assist the industry-and our understanding is that there are substantial numbers but,201
NA,certainly nowhere near the numbers that the member pointed out in that report; let us say the,201
NA,"numbers are somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 people to find new work-we have",201
NA,established a $155 million growth fund in conjunction with the South Australian and,201
NA,Victorian governments and the auto industry. There will be $30 million made available for a,201
NA,skills and training program to assist workers to find new jobs outside the industry. There will,201
NA,"be a $15 million automotive industrial structural adjustment fund, a $20 million automotive",201
NA,"diversification fund for component manufacturers to go into other areas, a $60 million next-",201
NA,generation manufacturing investment program to bring new businesses to those regions and a,201
NA,$30 million regional infrastructure fund to put new regional infrastructure in for communities.,201
Mr CHRISTENSEN ,"Dawson-The Nationals Deputy Whip) (10:45): Thank you,",201
NA,"minister, for your statements here this morning. I would ask a couple of questions. One is in",201
NA,relation to ARENA. I understand that a billion dollars worth of taxpayer funds have been,201
NA,committed to nearly 200 ARENA projects across a suite of renewable energy types. I am,201
NA,aware that a billion dollars of government funding has been matched with a further $1.8,201
NA,"billion, I believe, taking the investment in renewables to $2.8 billion as a result of that",201
NA,program. In Queensland we have over $55 million of ARENA funds that have been invested,201
NA,in six different projects.,201
NA,"The government has made it very clear, and rightly so, that we are facing a budget",201
NA,"emergency careering towards $667 billion worth of debt, right now resulting in a billion",201
NA,"dollars of interest every month, which could blow out to $3 billion. We understand that",201
NA,"savings need to be achieved to return that budget back to surplus. What are your plans, as the",201
NA,"minister, in relation to ARENA but more so in relation to the 200 projects that were supported",201
NA,under this program? I know that when those opposite were in charge of it there were certainly,201
NA,"some high-level failures, probably due to lack of oversight by the former government of those",201
NA,projects. I know a couple of them are sitting at the bottom of the ocean. I am looking at how,201
NA,"the government is going to actually deliver real, good outcomes for renewables with this",201
NA,investment.,201
NA,I also want to ask-and I know the member for Hinkler has asked a couple of questions on,201
NA,it-about the great Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme. It is a brilliant scheme as far as I,201
NA,"can see, taking the best of all of the programs that were there and rolling them into one, so",201
NA,"that it is almost one point of entry for industry and business. You know, minister-because",201
NA,you have been to my electorate a number of times and spoken with local businesses there-,201
NA,NA,201
NA,about the downturn and the impact that has had on the local economy in the Mackay region.,202
NA,That downturn in coalmining has cost thousands upon thousands of jobs but has also seen a,202
NA,significant shift in the way business has to be done locally and what the local manufacturing,202
NA,"industry is doing. They were always engaged with the mining sector, but now the taps have",202
NA,turned off somewhat they have to look elsewhere. I am interested to see how that,202
NA,Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme will assist them in that transition to other industries.,202
NA,"I think that is going to pay big dividends, just having had a look at the cursory information on",202
NA,it.,202
NA,"The other side might have been content with just leaving coalmining to wither and die, but",202
NA,I know that they are not our thoughts on the coal sector. We think it has a bright future. I,202
NA,notice that one of the significant policies you are going to be implementing is the minerals,202
NA,exploration tax incentive program. I am wanting to know a little bit about what the,202
NA,government is going to be doing to reboot the mining sector as well.,202
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:48): I thank the member,202
NA,for Dawson for his question. Mackay is certainly a wonderful city. Its people are particularly,202
NA,"wonderful. There is one in particular my daughter thinks is particularly, particularly",202
NA,"wonderful, although he has moved to Brisbane-I have no idea why; perhaps it is to be close",202
NA,"to my daughter. But, seriously, my daughter Kate spent some three years in Mackay. She",202
NA,"enthused about the city, and more about the fact that it was a city that was prepared to take on",202
NA,"the challenges. The region around it, of course, is well known. I am sure the member for",202
NA,Hinkler is aware that it is well known as a very prosperous cane-growing region. They have,202
NA,"their good years and their bad, like the coal industry, but there has been a substantial industry",202
NA,built up around it.,202
NA,I have had the pleasure of accompanying the member for Dawson to the Racecourse Sugar,202
NA,"Mill, where there is an excellent renewable energy project going on. The cogeneration project",202
NA,"relies, as I say, on the mandatory renewable energy target. I understand it also had some",202
NA,assistance from the government at the time. Prior to losing government in 2007 I had been up,202
NA,there and talked with their officials. So wherever you go you see great industries but you also,202
NA,see renewable energy industries.,202
NA,"ARENA has, as the member for Dawson alluded to, allocated in excess of $1 billion for",202
NA,"renewable energy projects in Australia. That is over 200 projects supported by taxpayers, with",202
NA,a further $1.8 billion being leveraged from the private sector. So there is approaching $3,202
NA,billion in projects as a result of the renewable energy programs that have been put in place.,202
NA,Our government will absolutely honour those contracts. Where those projects go on and,202
NA,"succeed, we will obviously applaud their success. If projects fail then obviously we will take",202
NA,that money back into the pot. But we certainly expect some great results from those programs,202
NA,that have already been funded under ARENA.,202
NA,Those opposite have made many mischievous and incorrect claims. and I will address a,202
NA,"couple of them later, if time permits. Contrary to the claims we hear from those opposite,",202
NA,"Australia is not walking away from renewable energy. In fact, we as a government are very",202
NA,"committed to renewable energy. As I said in answer to a question from the member for Brand,",202
NA,we were the government who began substantive funding of renewable energy and also,202
NA,established the renewable energy target.,202
NA,NA,202
NA,"By way of information, renewable energy is currently contributing around 10 per cent-",203
NA,"perhaps more, in fact, depending on how you do the sums and analyse the economists'",203
NA,predictions-of Australia's energy mix and is assisting not only in ensuring energy security,203
NA,"but also addressing some of the short-term peak demand loads, particularly on hot days in",203
NA,"Australia, through the very significant rollout of solar panels. Again, that is a program that the",203
NA,coalition began in its last term.,203
NA,I am asked about specific programs. I will just name a few. There are $80 million worth of,203
NA,investments encompassing nine projects in the ACT; $310 million invested in 49 projects in,203
NA,"New South Wales; $250,000 invested in a single project in the Northern Territory; $6 million",203
NA,"invested in a project in Tasmania; and $140 million in nine projects in South Australia, which",203
NA,I am sure will please the member for Wakefield; $84 million invested in nine projects in,203
NA,"Victoria; and $17 million invested in three projects in Western Australia. As well as that,",203
NA,"there have been multiple scholarships and fellowships, totalling around $90 million, awarded.",203
NA,Perhaps later in the session I might be able to highlight a couple of individual programs.,203
Mr CHAMPION ,"Wakefield) (10:53): Like the member for Gellibrand, I have also been",203
NA,"on a tour of a car plant with the minister. I thank him for inviting me at the time, along with",203
NA,quite a few Liberal senators. The member for Hindmarsh was there as well. The rhetoric was,203
NA,"somewhat different then, somewhat more optimistic about the car industry's prospects at that",203
NA,"time. Sadly, that has proved not to come to fruition.",203
NA,A government member interjecting-,203
Mr CHAMPION, A Labor government would have saved it. But I do not propose to,203
NA,"redebate those issues or, for that matter, to give the minister an excuse to give us the lecture",203
NA,about industry assistance only to be followed by government backbenchers asking for grants,203
NA,or tax exemptions for particular industries. It is an interesting approach that the government,203
NA,takes.,203
NA,"What I am concerned about, and this is a genuine concern, is the $155-million growth fund.",203
NA,I am concerned about its adequacy. Another of the things I am concerned about is obviously,203
NA,"the closure of Holden components industry will devastate the northern suburbs of Adelaide,",203
NA,"and Elizabeth in particular. I am interested to know if the minister, his office or his",203
NA,department have had discussions with the local councils of the City of Playford or the City of,203
NA,"Salisbury. In particular, have they had any discussions about local projects like the City of",203
NA,"Playford's sports precinct, which is interrelated with the proposal to have a health precinct at",203
NA,Lyell MCEwin Hospital? Both these local projects would produce jobs for the local area.,203
NA,"When Holden closes, I am concerned we will have an empty site sitting down there on",203
NA,Philip Highway and it may well be empty for some time. I would be interested to know if the,203
NA,"minister is having discussions with General Motors Holden about that site, about its future. I",203
NA,"would also be interested to know if the minister has formed a committee with unions, local",203
NA,"industry, Holden, the South Australian government and the federal department-as was done",203
NA,with Bridgestone-to help manage the process of skills acquisition of employees being made,203
NA,redundant at General Motors Holden or any of the component companies that supply it and to,203
NA,push job service agencies to get jobs for those redundant employees. It was a very important,203
NA,thing when Bridgestone closed. I would be interested to hear the minister's thoughts about,203
NA,that.,203
NA,NA,203
NA,Most of my concerns are of a local nature. We can debate the events last year. I can tell you,204
NA,the effect of them will be catastrophic in my community. I really genuinely would like to hear,204
NA,the minister's thoughts about how my local community can be assisted out of this $155-,204
NA,million growth fund. I do not think it is adequate and I have great fears that the money will be,204
NA,"spent in places other than the northern suburbs of Adelaide, in places other than the",204
NA,communities affected.,204
NA,Mr Zappia interjecting-,204
Mr CHAMPION, My colleague the member for Makin inquires how much will be,204
NA,actually allocated to South Australia. They are my concerns and I would be interested to hear,204
NA,by the minister's thoughts on them.,204
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (10:57): I thank the member,204
NA,"for his question. I plead guilty to being optimistic. As I said: farmer by nature, optimistic by",204
NA,"nature. If you go into government, as I know the Labor Party does so regularly, and take a",204
NA,"disastrous view of everything, be pessimistic and say it is a catastrophe then what will",204
NA,"happen, of course, is what we saw under the previous government-the confidence of the",204
NA,"community business community falls, consumer confidence falls, the economy spirals down",204
NA,and then the Labor Party drops back to its old form. There is no problem small enough that,204
NA,"the Labor Party cannot throw a huge amount of money at to try and fix with no strategy, no",204
NA,"outcomes, no guidelines et cetera. So when the Labor Party sees a problem, the first thing",204
NA,they say is 'throw as much borrowed taxpayers' money as you can possibly get your hands on,204
NA,"at it as quickly as possible'. As the member for Dawson said, why do we wonder why we are",204
NA,heading towards $667-billion worth of debt? Why do we wonder why in the six short years,204
NA,that Labor was in government they spent $181 billion more than they earned? In their forward,204
NA,"estimates there was a further $123 billion in losses going forward. If they were a company,",204
NA,their shareholders would have shut them down if ASIC had not done it first.,204
NA,I am asked about the Future Fund and how it will work and what consultations we have had,204
NA,"with industry and the unions. As the member quite rightly identified, when it comes to solving",204
NA,the issues in relation to the car industry I am bipartisan in my approach. As he quite rightly,204
NA,"said, I invited all those who are interested in being part of a solution to come along and see",204
NA,"what we can do. The Premier of South Australia was there, and there were senators from both",204
NA,"sides. As the member well knows, there were also trade unions there. I see trade unions as",204
NA,playing an important role in the transition of the car industry. I just hope that their leaders are,204
NA,more optimistic and more helpful than those who sit opposite and bleat and scream and call,204
NA,for us to throw more and more money at a problem.,204
NA,"There will be significant skills programs to assist those workers, and I know that the",204
NA,automotive companies will be involved. I have had extensive discussions with all three,204
NA,"companies. I know that the programs that Ford is running, and the associated programs that",204
NA,"are running in Geelong and North Melbourne to attract new businesses to those regions, have",204
NA,been very successful. I give the Labor Party its dues: they established that fund and set up a,204
NA,"framework for it to work under. We, as a government, have ensured that the framework has",204
NA,been adhered to and that the corporate governance of those schemes has been successful.,204
NA,We hope that we will have the support of the trade unions and the support of the South,204
NA,"Australian government. And-who knows?-perhaps the opposition, when they realise that",204
NA,"they are here to help the people they represent and not just whinge, will get behind these",204
NA,NA,204
NA,programs. I am more than comfortable to have the unions involved in assisting. I know that,205
NA,"some of the unions are involved very well. They have been positive. Yes, they have stood up",205
NA,"for their members. As an ex-union leader, I know that that is what they should do. But they do",205
NA,"need to accept the reality. Unlike those who sit opposite, at times I think the unions do",205
NA,understand. The best thing they can do for the workers in the car industry is to ensure that,205
NA,they transition to new and better jobs.,205
NA,"To answer the member's question, as we put together these programs within these",205
NA,companies I would welcome union involvement. I would welcome the involvement of the,205
NA,local federal members and the state members and senators if they think there are things in,205
NA,"those programs, particularly about reskilling people, that we can do better. I would be happy",205
NA,to see them involved.,205
NA,Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (11:02): I have a question for the minister in relation to,205
NA,"vocational education and training, the reforms to that sector and also the establishment of the",205
NA,VET Reform Taskforce. But let me start by saying that I am very positive about the changes,205
NA,that are being proposed and being talked about in this sector. I could not be more pleased that,205
NA,this government has been especially proactive in the area of VET.,205
NA,"Our national competitiveness, in my view, and our productivity is very dependent on us",205
NA,having a very strong VET sector. We need to make sure that our workforce of the future has,205
NA,skills that make them job ready so that when they enter the workforce they are ready to be,205
NA,productive and to be contributors on the first day that they enter the workforce.,205
NA,Across Australia our VET students deserve to know that they are receiving quality training,205
NA,and that what is being provided to them is going to meet their needs and will also meet the,205
NA,future needs of their employers. The providers need to know that they will be treated fairly in,205
NA,the provision of the training that they will be delivering to the sector. So we need to take this,205
NA,opportunity to put a magnifying glass over the VET sector and look at what reforms are,205
NA,"needed to make sure that this sector is viable in the future. It is certainly no easy task, but I",205
NA,must commend the minister on the action that he has taken to date in that sector. He has been,205
NA,especially proactive and has set up a number of mechanisms where he can get support and,205
NA,input directly from those who know best-those in the industry. He has embarked on a,205
NA,"consultation process, first hand, with the sector by establishing a number of workshops",205
NA,throughout the country to engage with the people who actually know best-training,205
NA,"providers, industry representatives, employers and students-to find out what is needed to",205
NA,reform this sector in the future.,205
NA,I attended workshops in Darwin and in Brisbane and also had the opportunity just recently,205
NA,"to facilitate workshops with the member for Grey in Port Pirie and Whyalla, with the member",205
NA,for Forrest in Bunbury and also with the member for Robertson in Gosford. The workshops,205
NA,that were run were certainly eye opening. At each of these sessions in different parts of the,205
NA,country we heard of similar problems with the VET sector relating to the duplication in,205
NA,regulations and administration amongst jurisdictions; inconsistency in auditing; the capacity,205
NA,of the system to meet the current skill needs of the industry; and what was particularly,205
NA,concerning was what seems to be an increased focus on qualifications rather than the quality,205
NA,"of the training in the sector and, as a result, the quality of the qualifications.",205
NA,"These sessions were not just about understanding what the issues are, they were also about",205
NA,finding ways for the sector to grow and to prosper. The outcomes-the information that came,205
NA,NA,205
NA,from those sessions-have been forwarded through so they will be part of the changes for,206
NA,future consideration. I would certainly like to thank everyone who was involved in those,206
NA,workshops. I would like to thank all of the members for the work that they put in to make sure,206
NA,that those who attended were quite representative of the various parts of the sector.,206
NA,So my question to the minister is: can the minister outline for members the action that the,206
NA,government is taking to ensure that the future of our nation is not just about building,206
NA,infrastructure and building the systems to support that but is also about building the skills of,206
NA,"our people, particularly those in the VET sector?",206
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (11:06): I want to thank the,206
NA,"member for MCPherson not only for her question but also for the great job, not only",206
NA,"supporting my portfolio in the area of skills and training but, in fact, right across government.",206
NA,She is an incredibly hard-working local member. She has a great practical background from,206
NA,being an engineer by trade and she is one of those people who is set on producing outcomes.,206
NA,The member for MACPherson has certainly continued that attitude since she came into,206
NA,"parliament. Again, I thank her for the work that she has done.",206
NA,"She is quite right: as she and I, my office and my department travel around Australia",206
NA,"looking at the issues in relation to skills, training, traineeships and apprenticeships we are at",206
NA,times dismayed by the attitude of some people in relation to making sure that we are,206
NA,"producing people who are employer ready. That is, people who are skilled up and ready to go",206
NA,into the workforce not only to secure a long-term future for themselves in their chosen,206
NA,"profession-I am sure that that profession may change in time, and we all see that even",206
NA,"amongst our families-but also making sure that when young people and mature apprentices,",206
NA,"who play an important part in our training system, are turned out onto the street looking for a",206
NA,job that there is a job that they can go straight into.,206
NA,The member for MCPherson is right that there has been too much of an attitude-I am not,206
NA,"saying that it is overwhelming, but I am saying it is prevalent-where there has been training",206
NA,for training's sake. There has also been an attitude that the only way you can go forward in,206
NA,"this world is to go to university and get a degree. I remember very, very vividly the Labor",206
NA,Party giving Brendan Nelson an absolute flogging because he had the courage to say in the,206
NA,"House, and I remember him saying it when he was the education minister, that a trade is",206
NA,worth every bit as much as a degree. I remember the Labor Party pillorying the then Minister,206
NA,"for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, for saying that a trade is worth as much",206
NA,"as a university degree. I assure those opposite that I believe that as well, and that the people",206
NA,on this side of the chamber believe that too.,206
NA,An honourable member interjecting-,206
NA,"Mr IAN MACFARLANE: Well, if you believe it you should say it a bit more so that the",206
NA,young people in your electorate actually believe that their future can be achieved just as well,206
NA,"as any university graduate's by being a tradesperson or trainee, getting a skill and filling an",206
NA,"occupation. Do not give them false hope-we hear too often from those opposite that, if it",206
NA,"does not go to plan, the government will just subsidise you or pick you up.",206
NA,"The member for MCPherson has identified a key area that we will fix, and that is",206
NA,"inconsistency in auditing. In fact, we see a whole opportunity within the skills space to",206
NA,"streamline it. The member for MCPherson and other members of my committee, which is",206
NA,NA,206
NA,"headed up by the member for Dawson, are working with us and with the people out there in",207
NA,"the RTOs, the apprenticeship centres and the skills areas to make sure that we streamline this",207
NA,"area so that, when we spend money, we actually get results. As I said earlier, in the area of",207
NA,"innovation, when we came into office, we found a whole string of programs that in fact had",207
NA,money allocated to them but had never even been implemented. When I asked the department,207
NA,"what these schemes did, they said, 'Minister, they haven't started yet, so we can't actually tell",207
NA,you.' What outcomes did they produce? Zero.,207
NA,Any discussion on skills would be incomplete without me mentioning the government's,207
NA,"introduction of Trade Support Loans. These loans, which I mentioned earlier, provide the",207
NA,"opportunity for a four-year apprentice to borrow up to $20,000 and, at completion, have",207
NA,"$4,000, or 20 per cent, of that loan written off as an incentive. To receive that loan interest",207
NA,"free until he or she repays it is a huge incentive. In fact, it is worth probably over $12,000, or",207
NA,more than double the previous Tools for Your Trade scheme. We see from this scheme,207
NA,"tremendous support coming back from the trainee community. As I said, I saw it myself in my",207
NA,own electorate. This is a great opportunity for young people to do their trades and be,207
NA,successful.,207
Mr ZAPPIA ,"Makin) (11:12): Minister, firstly, thank you for your introductory statement.",207
NA,"I have noted your response to the questions from this side. As you would probably be aware,",207
NA,manufacturing in this country has fallen in terms of employment percentage throughout,207
NA,Australia from about 26 per cent 50 years ago to around eight per cent at the moment. It is,207
NA,very likely those numbers are going to fall even further as a result of losses in the auto,207
NA,"industry over the next few years, losses perhaps in the defence industry if decisions are not",207
NA,"made sooner rather than later, and losses that will arise, I believe, from the Abbott",207
NA,government's cut to renewable energy programs in this country.,207
NA,"I note that in this budget there is about $7 billion of cuts in higher education, science and",207
NA,"research, industry and innovation, of which about $3 billion comes from your own",207
NA,department. Given that we hope for a successful future in manufacturing-and I think there is,207
NA,a general consensus that that will be underpinned by advanced manufacturing-and given the,207
NA,Prime Minister's recent comments whilst overseas that science and innovation is effectively,207
NA,"the key to our future, which I agree with, how can you justify not only the cuts to your own",207
NA,department of $3 billion but the $7 billion in cuts across the science and research,207
NA,"organisations, which, undoubtedly, go to the heart of innovation in this country?",207
NA,"I heard your responses to questions from the member for Brand earlier on. In particular,",207
NA,you made the comment that you believe that Geoscience Australia still will have the capacity,207
NA,to function and to carry out its responsibilities. I ask also: with the cuts that that organisation,207
NA,"is going to receive, in conjunction with my earlier questions how can you assure us that",207
NA,organisations like Geoscience Australia and other similar organisations that will be subjected,207
NA,to these cuts will be able to carry out the work that they do and support industry in this,207
NA,country as they do?,207
NA,I particularly also note the programs that the previous government had in the way of direct,207
NA,"industry assistance, which amounted to some $800-plus million. Those programs have been",207
NA,"cut by almost 50 per cent. I noted your comments about the entrepreneurial funding program,",207
NA,"and I understand that, but the bottom line is: how do you justify all of those cuts and still",207
NA,expect that there will be able to give industry the support it needs both in science and,207
NA,NA,207
NA,innovation and in direct assistance to be able to go into the future and perhaps rather than fall,208
NA,in numbers grow in numbers and grow in capacity?,208
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (11:15): I thank the member,208
NA,"for Makin for his question. Can I just say from the outset that, if he does not accept that there",208
NA,"needs to be cuts to the budget, then is he continuing the old Labor way of continuing to run",208
NA,deficits? In my time in parliament I have never seen a Labor surplus. The reality is that there,208
NA,are members of this parliament who have never seen a surplus in their life from Labor. That is,208
NA,the reality. If the member for Makin says we shouldn't make cuts in this area he needs to now,208
NA,"stand up and say where he will make those cuts. If he doesn't, we just assume that Labor will",208
NA,"continue on their way with $123 billion worth of deficits in the forward estimates, with the",208
NA,"continuation of the debt blowing out to $667 billion, and with the continuation of the pressure",208
NA,that that creates in terms of our economy. He knows and I know that that position is nowhere,208
NA,near sustainable.,208
NA,I want to correct the member for Makin in terms of his statement that we have cut the,208
NA,science and research budget. We have not cut the science and research budget. Can I read for,208
NA,"him from our budget papers that the appropriation available to the science and research areas,",208
NA,"including science agencies such as Geoscience Australia and CSIRO, stands at $5,849",208
NA,"million, and that the increase in the budget-increase in the budget-is in fact $16.8 million.",208
NA,"So even at a time where I accept we have to have some austerity measures, even at a time",208
NA,"where I accept we have to refocus the programs that the previous government was operating,",208
NA,"there is an increase. As I have pointed out on numerous occasions during this session,",208
NA,programs were never actually implemented. Some programs never got past the great launch,208
NA,and potentially relaunch and the great talk that went on about programs that never actually,208
NA,delivered a thing.,208
NA,"So, yes, we have cut some of those programs, and yes we have put in place a far more",208
NA,"focused system of $484 million for the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program, a program",208
NA,where we take the best of Enterprise Connect and Commercialisation Australia and we put it,208
NA,into the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program. This is a program where we make sure that we,208
NA,"are giving business what they need to be competitive, to be innovative, to get into global",208
NA,"supply chains, to be involved in the new industries and to give their workers sustainable jobs.",208
NA,On top of that of course we have got the industry skills program which further assists those,208
NA,"businesses to ensure that they, the business, and their employees have the skills that they need",208
NA,"to make the adjustments in front. That is $1 billion worth of programs for innovation, for",208
NA,"skilling, for competitiveness, for getting involved in new products, for collaborating with",208
NA,existing businesses-a set of programs that will ensure businesses the opportunity to be,208
NA,competitive in the long term.,208
NA,But for the benefit of the member for Makin can I just highlight a few areas where we have,208
NA,actually spent new money in the areas of science and research. There is $65.7 million to,208
NA,"operate and maintain the CSIRO's new vessel, RV Investigator. I know those on this side of",208
NA,"the chamber will not be surprised to hear this, but only the Labor Party could build a boat and",208
NA,not put any money in there to use it. So the boat was going to sit there at port-like a lot of,208
NA,"their programs: set up with great fanfare, moored to the dock but not operate. We have",208
NA,actually put some money in to make sure that that boat gets out to sea and does something.,208
NA,NA,208
NA,We put $31.6 million into the operation and maintenance of the OPAL nuclear research,209
NA,"facility. It is a great facility. It is making great advances in nuclear medicine, which is",209
NA,something we need to continue to do. We have put $28 million into continued investment in,209
NA,Questacon through science for Australia's future to ensure that Australia's children are as,209
NA,excited as much by science as I am.,209
Mr WILSON ,"O'Connor) (11:20): Mr Deputy Speaker Porter, as a former Treasurer of",209
NA,"the great state of Western Australia, you would well understand the importance of the",209
NA,"resource sector. Minister, you would know that the mining sector contributes about 10 per",209
NA,"cent of our GDP, directly employs 270,000 Australians and supports work and income for",209
NA,"another 800,000. The Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics released their resources",209
NA,and energy major projects report last month that showed that in the last 12 months a record,209
NA,"$57 billion worth of resource projects had been finalised in Australia, with a significant",209
NA,"increase in production. I understand this includes 215 million tonnes of iron ore, 43 million",209
NA,"tonnes of coal and more than 1,100 petajoules of gas.",209
NA,Over recent years it is clear that Australians have benefited from the jobs and growth,209
NA,"flowing from the high levels of investment in the resource sector, but the Bureau of Resources",209
NA,and Energy Economics also reports that Australia's resource sector is moving into a new,209
NA,phase of sustained output and production following the peak of the current resources,209
NA,investment cycle. The resources sector will continue to drive our economy through this new,209
NA,"phase, but it is essential that we do not become complacent. These production phase figures",209
NA,highlight the importance of setting the right policy framework to encourage future investment,209
NA,in the resources sector. There is a need for ongoing progress in removing barriers to,209
NA,"investment in the resources sector to encourage investment and confidence, to get rid of the",209
NA,reams of red tape and remove tax slugs that compromise productivity and competitiveness.,209
NA,"This output phase will last for decades, delivering sustained and substantial economic benefits",209
NA,"for Australian workers and local communities as well as boosting national revenue. Minister,",209
NA,what is the government doing to ensure a long and sustainable future for the resources,209
NA,industry?,209
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (11:22): As the member for,209
NA,"O'Connor noted, both Deputy Speaker Porter and he took a vital interest in the development",209
NA,of the resources industry in their previous times. The member for O'Connor has a very strong,209
NA,interest in the resources sector not only because he is the member for O'Connor. Some people,209
NA,would argue that O'Connor is at the heart of the history of the Australian resources industry.,209
NA,"The centre for that is in Kalgoorlie, which I have had the opportunity to visit. The Mining",209
NA,Hall of Fame in Kalgoorlie is certainly an apt reminder of the huge debt we owe to the miners,209
NA,and resource investors of Australia going right back to the 1800s.,209
NA,I also congratulate the member for O'Connor for his transition to politics. He has a,209
NA,background a little similar to mine. We were both farmers once. I guess he is still more active,209
NA,"than I am-in fact, I am sure he is; these are no longer the hands of a farmer. I am sure the",209
NA,member for O'Connor still delights in getting out in the paddock and driving the harvester or,209
NA,perhaps crutching a few sheep if he is having a really good day. I congratulate him on his,209
NA,transition to politics and for his advocacy not only for the industries in his electorate but for,209
NA,all members of the seat of O'Connor.,209
NA,NA,209
NA,He was quite right when he talked about the importance of the resource sector. The,210
NA,"resource sector contributes around 10 per cent of our GDP, employs over one-quarter of a",210
NA,"million Australians and indirectly provides income to another 800,000, so over one million",210
NA,"people rely on the resource sector for their income and their living. As I said earlier, the",210
NA,resource sector is heaving a huge sigh of relief that the coalition have come back into,210
NA,government and that we have relieved them from the burden of the last six years when they,210
NA,"were used as a punching bag by people like the member for Lilley, who constantly attacked",210
NA,"successful Australian resource figures. Then, when he had finished degrading their characters",210
NA,"quite unfairly, he went on to empty their pockets with things like the ill-fated mining resource",210
NA,"rent tax, which had about five iterations. In the end, as we know, it was a great tax introduced",210
NA,by the Treasurer that actually raised no money at all. It chased away billions of dollars worth,210
NA,of investment but did nothing.,210
NA,The member for O'Connor asked me what we are going to do to support the resources,210
NA,"sector. Apart from putting the 'open for business' sign up, apart from reducing red tape and",210
NA,"green tape and introducing the one-stop shop, we are going to remove the carbon tax, which",210
NA,"will give them a huge boost, and we are also going to remove the mining tax. It will be",210
NA,interesting to watch those people opposite vote against those measures when they know that,210
NA,the people of Australia want them removed and they know that the people of Australia depend,210
NA,on the Australian resource industry and industry in general being competitive.,210
NA,"The member for O'Connor also asked me what policy initiatives we are going to take,",210
NA,which gives me the opportunity to answer the latter part of the member for Dawson's,210
NA,"question. We are going to introduce a $100 million Exploration Development Incentive,",210
NA,previously known as flow-through shares. I think it was the member for Wakefield who said it,210
NA,was a subsidy. That just highlights how little those who sit opposite know about the resource,210
NA,"industry. The exploration incentive allows individual entities, mum-and-dad Australians, to",210
NA,"invest in the R&D, the research and development, of the resource industry in Australia. What",210
NA,"better way is there to do it and say to them: 'If you put your money at risk then, just as we do",210
NA,"in the research and development area where we provide a tax incentive for people to do that,",210
NA,"we will provide you with a tax incentive to invest in one of Australia's great sectors, the",210
NA,resource sector.' So we are putting in place an Exploration Development Incentive and I look,210
NA,forward to returning to Kalgoorlie with the member for O'Connor where I campaigned with,210
NA,him and we promised that if we got into government we would introduce this scheme. Unlike,210
NA,"those who sit opposite, we will do that. We will go back to the drilling sheds, where we stood",210
NA,"with people who had put their whole livelihoods at risk to go out and explore for minerals,",210
NA,"and we will say, 'We promised and we delivered,' unlike those who sit opposite.",210
Ms BIRD ,"Cunningham) (11:27): Minister, I am happy if you want to take these questions",210
NA,on notice to give as much opportunity as possible for people who want to ask you questions. I,210
NA,would like to get some information on the Industry Skills Fund that is in the budget papers. I,210
NA,acknowledge that its arrival has heralded the demise of $1 billion worth of programs and I,210
NA,note that the minister indicated earlier that some of his thinking was informed by the fact that,210
NA,some of those programs both had not started and had no enrolments. One would think that,210
NA,"would be a fairly logical consequence of not having started, but I would appreciate it if the",210
NA,minister could indicate which of the programs that have been cut had not started and which,210
NA,"had had nil outcomes. Secondly, in relation to the replacement Industry Skills Fund, there are",210
NA,NA,210
NA,"industries listed as targeted in the budget papers, in particular, health and biomedical",211
NA,"products, and I would like to know if that will also encompass skills programs with a broader",211
NA,health workforce. I am particularly interested in the emerging areas of employment,211
NA,"opportunity into the future around issues such as aged care, disability care and the health",211
NA,sector care workforce in general. They had a significant take-up of the National Workforce,211
NA,"Development Fund, so whether they are still going to be able to participate in the new fund",211
NA,would be useful information. I am also asking for that information in relation to the ICT,211
NA,"sector, because the emerging ICT industry sector jobs have been important as well for many",211
NA,"regional areas, including my own. How is the minister going to determine what exactly will",211
NA,be targeted under that program in terms of industry sectors?,211
NA,"The budget paper indicate that there are 121,500 training places and, it says, 74,300",211
NA,"support services, including mentoring and foundation skills. Is it intended to operate two",211
NA,"separate programs for those numbers or is the 74,300 within the 121,500 and is it a joint",211
NA,program? What exactly is envisaged in that part of the industry skills fund? I am happy for,211
NA,"you to answer those questions now or to take them on notice, Minister.",211
NA,Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom-Minister for Industry) (11:29): I thank the member,211
NA,"for her question and I will have to take it on notice, unfortunately. I thank the shadow minister",211
NA,for her positive attitude to the changes that are going on within this portfolio. I know there are,211
NA,areas she disagrees with but she is happy to sit down and talk about it. I am happy to supply,211
NA,all that information. The skills fund guidelines are still being finalised but when they are I will,211
NA,be happy to provide you with a full briefing.,211
NA,Ms Bird interjecting-,211
NA,"Mr IAN MACFARLANE: Very soon is the answer to that, hopefully by 30 June.",211
NA,Proposed expenditure agreed to.,211
NA,Social Services Portfolio,211
NA,"Proposed expenditure, $9,606,728,000",211
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (11:31): One of the biggest surprises for the aged care sector,211
NA,coming out of the budget was the cessation of the aged care payroll tax supplement from 1,211
NA,"January 2015 as found on budget paper No. 2, page 189. It effectively ended the doctrine of",211
NA,competitive neutrality in the sector between the for-profit providers and the not-for-profit,211
NA,providers. It ripped away $652.7 million over four years from the sector. It was a bit of a,211
NA,"shock because there was no consultation or sector support for it. The CEO of Benetas, Sandra",211
NA,"Hills, expressed in a letter to me on 4 June the following:",211
NA,The greater issue is the impact that the removal of the payroll tax supplement will have on investment in,211
NA,"the sector. Aged care in Australia must have a mix of providers to ensure we remain a competitive,",211
NA,innovative industry that offers the highest quality of services available. Removal of this payroll tax,211
NA,supplement will seriously threaten some providers resulting in less competition across the industry.,211
NA,"She goes on to outline her concerns about the impact on organisational cash flow, future",211
NA,"investment, staffing, skills retention and artificial wage constraint.",211
NA,I have a few significant questions for the minister. What modelling was undertaken into the,211
NA,"impact on the aged-care sector of this budget measure on viability of providers, their",211
NA,"profitability, jobs, workforce and investment? In particular, what has the modelling revealed",211
NA,NA,211
NA,"about the impact on independent providers, small providers and those in rural and regional",212
NA,"areas? If no modelling was undertaken, why not?",212
NA,I understand also there has been some redirection of the workforce supplement into some,212
NA,"sweeteners for the viability supplement. Within a few weeks of the budget, leading aged-care",212
NA,services provided some details of the impact on specific providers including in regional,212
NA,"Queensland, which saw that particular provider receive an additional $2,900 in the viability",212
NA,"supplement but lose $100,000 to $120,000 in the payroll tax supplement. I am sure they can",212
NA,provide you with the details.,212
NA,I would be interested to know how you intend to deal with the significant impost on the,212
NA,sector. The inaugural report of the Aged Care Financing Authority from 30 June 2013 reports,212
NA,the average net profit before tax across the sector is just 5.6 per cent. How does the,212
NA,government expect the sector to remain viable with this further impost? Has the minister,212
NA,"undertaken any specific modelling into the impact on residential pricing? If not, why not? If",212
NA,"he has done modelling, what does that show?",212
NA,I would like the minister to explain why the payroll tax supplement is being ceased on 31,212
NA,December 2014. Why is it that the minister has actually ended the principle of competitive,212
NA,neutrality which has been accepted by both sides of parliament since 1988? I refer also to the,212
NA,"comments of Louis Dudley, the managing director of Bupa care services, he said recently:",212
NA,"I have to go to each of the state governments now and discuss with each one, one at a time, which really",212
NA,"is increasing red tape, and that's the opposite of what the government was trying to achieve nationally.",212
NA,How does the end of competitive neutrality sit with the policy of your government in the,212
NA,reduction of red tape as well?,212
NA,"You would appreciate, of course, that, according to ACFA, we will need to build an",212
NA,"additional 80,000 aged-care places over the next decade. This involves an extra $25 billion,",212
NA,"according to ACFA. You would be aware, Minister, that the surprise budget announcement",212
NA,"actually forced one provider, Japara Healthcare, to halt trading. I wonder how you expect the",212
NA,sector to cope with the increased investment they need to build residential aged-care,212
NA,placements and capital infrastructure in the decades ahead.,212
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (11:35): Payroll tax is,212
NA,"essentially a state tax. States impose a variety of taxes, including payroll tax. So, effectively,",212
NA,this supplement was the Commonwealth transferring funds to the various states around,212
NA,Australia via the aged-care sector. It is this government's belief that states are responsible for,212
NA,"their own tax measures, including payroll tax, and that this is a matter, therefore, for the",212
NA,"states. On that basis, the Commonwealth decided that in future we are not going to",212
NA,"supplement-we are not going to, in effect, provide a subsidy to-the states in relation to",212
NA,their taxes. That is a matter entirely for the states.,212
Mr LAMING ,"Bowman) (11:36): Minister, would you clarify something for many people",212
NA,in my electorate who have been receiving and expressing great concern about some Labor,212
NA,"Party material that was circulated, focused on the pension in particular. I understand there",212
NA,"have been some flyers put out by Labor Senator Cameron saying, quite inaccurately, that",212
NA,pensioners will lose the seniors supplement. That has now been clarified as not true in that,212
NA,they do not even receive this supplement.,212
NA,NA,212
NA,"Obviously, it is an appalling campaign and the misinformation has caused great concern. It",213
NA,"really does reflect an opposition party with no ideas for the future, no clue, no platform of",213
NA,their own and no alternative budget. We know that pensions will continue to increase twice,213
NA,"every year and into the future, even with the re-indexation changes in 2017 locking them into",213
NA,"the cost of living, but the scare campaign evidently has had its effect. It has caused great",213
NA,concern about the impact on the pension supplement. Could you confirm the status of that,213
NA,supplement in the budget and whether it will be increasing at all in the future?,213
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (11:37): I thank the member for,213
NA,"Bowman for his question. Indeed, I have seen the flyer that he refers to. Indeed, I have it in",213
NA,my hand at the present time. This is a flyer which is authorised and printed by Senator Doug,213
NA,"Cameron, 5 Raymond Road, Springwood, New South Wales.",213
Mr Laming," Is that the only Doug Cameron, or could it be-",213
Mr ANDREWS," I do not think there are two Senator Doug Camerons, no. Senator",213
NA,"Cameron, who happens to also be the shadow minister for human services, I believe, put out",213
NA,"this flyer, in which he said, amongst other things: 'Age pensioners lose $876.20 per annum",213
NA,seniors supplement.' One would hope that the shadow minister for human services would,213
NA,"actually know the facts of who receives what. Presumably, he has now sought to clarify that.",213
NA,"To come to your question, the age pension will continue to go up and so will the pensioner",213
NA,"supplement. Indeed, in March of this year, the age pension increased by $15.70 for singles",213
NA,and by $11.90 for each member of a pensioner couple. That was three months ago. In three,213
NA,"months time, in September, the age pension will increase again, as it will in March and",213
NA,"September of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018-and I could keep going, but I will not take up the",213
NA,"time of the chamber-continuing for years into the future. In addition to that, the pensioners",213
NA,"will keep the energy supplement, which is up to $361 per annum for singles and up to $546",213
NA,"per annum for couples. In addition to that, if the Labor Party would finally see some reason",213
NA,"and allow the repeal of the carbon tax, pensioner households would be also better off as a",213
NA,"result of that measure passing the Senate. In addition to that, the pension supplement will",213
NA,"continue into the future. Currently that is worth up to $1,635.40 for singles and up to",213
NA,"$2,464.80 for couples. The pension supplement will also increase in future.",213
NA,So in relation to pensioners-contrary to what the Labor Party around the country is,213
NA,seeking to mislead people about-pensions will continue to increase in March and September,213
NA,"of each year, not just this year but each year into the future. The pension supplement will",213
NA,"continue to be paid and that, too, will increase. As I said, the pensioners will keep their energy",213
NA,"supplement of $361 per annum for singles and $546 per annum for couples, and if the carbon",213
NA,tax is repealed there will be an average benefit per household in Australia of some $550. That,213
NA,"will vary according to the configuration of the household, but none the less that would be an",213
NA,advantage for pensioners as well.,213
NA,A division having been called in the House of Representatives-,213
NA,Sitting suspended from 11:41 to 12:02,213
Mr ANDREWS," Now, I can just wrap up in summary by saying that for pensioners, the",213
NA,pension will continue to increase. It will go up twice a year in March and September of each,213
NA,year. The pensioner supplement will continue and pensioners will continue to get paid the,213
NA,NA,213
NA,energy supplement. And if the Labor Party would get out of the way they would have a major,214
NA,saving through the repeal of the carbon tax.,214
Ms MACKLIN ,Jagajaga) (12:02): I just draw the minister's attention to the remarks that,214
NA,"he made on Gold Coast ABC radio, where it he actually said that he is making changes to the",214
NA,pensioner supplement and is actually seeking to remove it. So either the minister does not,214
NA,know what he is talking about-,214
NA,A government member interjecting-,214
Ms MACKLIN, I am actually quoting the minister on ABC radio on the Gold Coast.,214
NA,"Now, obviously-",214
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,214
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Randall): Order! The member for Jagajaga is on her feet,214
NA,and she is entitled to be heard in silence.,214
Ms MACKLIN, The minister has already indicated that he does not understand the,214
NA,"budget, and he has just tried to say, as he said in question time this week, that pensioners are",214
NA,better off under this government. I have to say to the minister that that will come to haunt,214
NA,"him. The Assistant Minister for Social Services, Senator Fifield, actually said in Senate",214
NA,"estimates just a little while ago, 'The decision to cut the indexation of the pension was put in",214
NA,place in an effort to slow the rate of pension increase.',214
NA,I am sure the minister is aware of the report done by the Australian Council of Social,214
NA,Service that shows that pensioners will be around $80 a week worse off over the next 10,214
NA,"years. That is $80 a week over 10 years and, of course, that is because, as the minister himself",214
NA,knows-,214
NA,A government member interjecting-,214
Ms MACKLIN, I will just remind the minister of a quote I have from him from the,214
NA,Hansard of 20 September 2011 about the importance of using male total average weekly,214
NA,earnings to index pensions instead of using the CPI. At that time the minister-though he was,214
NA,"not the minister then-said, 'This enabled pensioners to keep ahead of cost-of-living",214
NA,"increases.' Exactly right. The minister got it back in 2011. Now, of course, what we see in the",214
NA,budget papers on page 203 is that the government is going to take $449 million off,214
NA,"pensioners. That is what the budget papers say, and this was confirmed just yesterday by",214
NA,Senator Cormann when he said that the budget cuts will result in a cut to the pension.,214
NA,"The question to the minister is: who is right-the budget papers, which say a cut to the",214
NA,"pension of $449 million; Senator Cormann, who says that the cuts will result in a reduction in",214
NA,"the rate of increase to the pension; or Senator Fifield, saying that the cuts to the indexation of",214
NA,the pension have been put in place in an effort to slow the rate of pension increase? I would,214
NA,suggest to the minister that all of those comments by his colleagues are correct. What is the,214
NA,minister going to say to correct the misleading comments that he made on ABC radio and that,214
NA,he made in the parliament this week?,214
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:06): The honourable,214
NA,"member opposite should quote the entire radio interview and not excerpts from it, because if",214
NA,she quotes the entire radio interview she will see that I pointed out when I came back to that,214
NA,matter that it was the senior supplement. So she should be more accurate in what she says. I,214
NA,NA,214
NA,ask this question rhetorically: if it is good enough for the Labor Party when in government to,215
NA,index family tax benefit part A by the CPI why is it not appropriate to index pensions and,215
NA,other payments by the CPI as well? There is a great deal of hypocrisy-,215
NA,Ms Macklin: I rise on a point of order. This is an opportunity for us to ask questions about,215
NA,the budget. The point of order is that these budget papers-which is what this is all about-,215
NA,"says that there is a cut of $449 million. That is a cut to the pension, and it is time the minister",215
NA,faced up to it.,215
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, The member for Jagajaga is reiterating the question; it is not a,215
NA,point of order.,215
Mr Nikolic," Mr Deputy Speaker, if I could, I would like to respond. Yet again, the",215
NA,member for Jagajaga stands up with these ridiculous debating points.,215
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Resume your seat, Member for Bass. That is not a point of",215
NA,order either. Does the minister wish to continue?,215
Mr ANDREWS," Yes. First of all, she is inaccurate about the quotation in relation to the",215
NA,"radio interviews. Secondly, the Labor Party come in here feigning indignation about indexing",215
NA,"payments to the CPI when they themselves in government, when-",215
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,215
Mr ANDREWS," the person on the other side interjecting was the relevant minister,",215
NA,indexed family tax benefit part A by the CPI. That is the reality.,215
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,215
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Minister, please resume your seat. This is not going to satisfy",215
NA,any elicitation of information if we have a continual argy-bargy across the chamber.,215
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,215
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Member for Jagajaga, you have asked your question. I ask the",215
NA,minister to resume when there is silence.,215
Mr ANDREWS, The Labor Party and the member who was just speaking continue to,215
NA,"argue mischievously that this government are going to cut pensions, that we are reducing",215
NA,"pensions. Can I point out to the honourable member opposite that, in March this year-and as",215
NA,far as I recall we were in government in March of this year-the age pension increased by,215
NA,$15.70 for a single pensioner. How can an increase be a cut? This reminds me of Lewis,215
NA,Caroll-this is Alice in Wonderland stuff coming from the honourable member opposite. In,215
NA,"Labor language, a $15.70 increase for single pensioners is somehow a cut and an $11.90",215
NA,increase for each on a couple pension is somehow a cut. Go out on the street and ask ordinary,215
NA,"Australians, 'If we give you an extra $11.90, is that an increase or a decrease?' The reality is it",215
NA,is going to be an increase.,215
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,215
NA,NA,215
NA,I have learnt the rule that we are not to use props in this place or the other place.,215
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, I have already ruled and asked the member for Jagajaga not to,215
NA,"continue using props, and I hope she takes that admonition.",215
NA,NA,215
Mr ANDREWS, What was the indexation for the $11.90 increase for each pensioner in a,216
NA,"couple and the $15.70 increase for single pensioners in March? CPI, the consumer price",216
NA,index. The increase that occurred in March occurred according to the consumer price index.,216
NA,"We are saying that in the future we propose to index this, as the Labor Party did when in",216
NA,"government, for family tax benefit part A according to the consumer price index. The Labor",216
NA,Party are running around this country trying to scare pensioners by saying that there is going,216
NA,to be no increase in the age pension. There was an increase in the age pension three months,216
NA,ago and there will be another one in another three months time. This great lie from the Labor,216
NA,Party will be found out when pensioners get their next increase in September.,216
Mr NIKOLIC ,Bass) (12:11): Before I ask the minister a question I want to reflect on the,216
NA,member for Jagajaga's recent visit to Launceston where she continued her all-scare-and-no-,216
NA,substance campaign about concessions for pensioners-subsequently found to be false with,216
NA,the Premier of Tasmania saying that the Commonwealth contribution was only relatively,216
NA,small and would be covered in full. She talked to pensioners in Bass about pension cuts that,216
NA,were not true. Yet again we saw the member for Jagajaga engaging in her mendacious,216
NA,"campaign, which is all scare and no substance. We see it on display again.",216
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,216
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Randall): Order! We have a question coming. He has,216
NA,five minutes.,216
Mr NIKOLIC, If I could just thank the minister. During almost all of the 43rd Parliament,216
NA,I was a full-time candidate down in Bass and his door was always open to talk about issues of,216
NA,substance. One of the issues we talked about and that I campaigned strongly on before the last,216
NA,election that always attracted a great deal of interest in northern Tasmania was indexation of,216
NA,the income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health card. I can recall talking to large,216
NA,"groups of people, including with people from the Association of Independent Retirees. There",216
NA,was a great deal of interest in this issue.,216
NA,The minister's office staff were always very welcoming and were ready to provide us with,216
NA,details in relation to these matters. I was able to report to the Association of Independent,216
NA,Retirees that the coalition had made a very strong commitment to index the income thresholds,216
NA,"for the Commonwealth seniors card. If I recall correctly, we made the same strong",216
NA,commitment at both the 2010 and 2013 elections. How refreshing to see that that promise has,216
NA,translated to a budgeted measure in this year's budget. This measure improves the lives of,216
NA,"many Australian senior citizens and it does so in a way that is intended to be fair, clear and",216
NA,"consistent. I know the government is being as generous as it can be at this time, given the",216
NA,wider national social context of strong fiscal restoration and recovery.,216
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,216
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Member for Jagajaga, please!",216
Mr NIKOLIC," It is necessary that we engage in a process of strong fiscal recovery,",216
NA,especially after a government that delivered $191 billion in deficits in their six years of,216
NA,government and $123 billion of deficits projected across the forward estimates. We borrow $1,216
NA,billion every month just to pay the interest on our debt. That is why we have to engage in that,216
NA,strong process of fiscal restoration and recovery.,216
NA,NA,216
NA,Our indexation promise is reflective of a government that has both a heart and a strong,217
NA,"social conscience. It is matched by a strong desire to help, assist and support all seniors, both",217
NA,pensioners and self-funded retirees alike. Our decision to index the Commonwealth seniors,217
NA,health card is important in my electorate of Bass but will no doubt resonate across the nation.,217
NA,Does the minister have any estimate of how many people will specifically benefit from this,217
NA,measure and how many new cardholders the government expects over the years as a result of,217
NA,this measure?,217
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:14): I thank the member for,217
NA,"Bass for his comments and his questions. Indeed, it was my pleasure to spend some time with",217
NA,the member for Bass during the time leading up to his successful election. I wish him great,217
NA,success and longevity in continuing to represent the constituents of Bass. I look forward to,217
NA,working with him for many years into the future to ensure that the good citizens of Bass are,217
NA,well and truly represented in this place.,217
NA,"Yes, I can say to the member for Bass this measure has been budgeted for. The estimates",217
NA,"are that by 2018 there will be nearly 27,000 additional cardholders because of these measures.",217
NA,It is interesting the Labor Party is very silent on this measure. There is reason for that-in,217
NA,their whole six years in government they did not index it once. No wonder there is silence,217
NA,coming from the other side.,217
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,217
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, The member for Jagajaga's comments are unhelpful.,217
Mr ANDREWS," So 27,000 additional cardholders benefit under this measure. This is",217
NA,"something which is to the advantage of many senior Australians and something which, I am",217
NA,"sure, the member for Bass and the other members of the chamber-on this side at least-are",217
NA,very proud of.,217
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (12:16): I was recently in the member for Bass's electorate and,217
NA,"about 100 people were worried about things like senior supplements, age pensions and aged",217
NA,care. There were 100 people in the Launceston town hall. I do not think there would be many,217
NA,votes for him at the next election when it comes to those people.,217
NA,"My question is to the minister on aged care. Minister, one of the first things you did when",217
NA,you came to power was to disable-,217
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,217
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Order! Member for Blair, I cannot hear your question. There",217
NA,is disorder. I would ask everybody to be silent so we can hear the member for Blair.,217
Mr NEUMANN," the workforce supplement, which had been accessed to the tune of about",217
NA,$100 million by aged-care providers. The supplement was for consultation and negotiation in,217
NA,dealing with aged-care sector to make sure that we had the workforce of the future with,217
NA,"adequate remuneration for nurses, carers, IT professionals and administrators of the aged",217
NA,"care-sector. Minister, one of the first things I would like you to do is explain how you will",217
NA,address the growing pressures in the aged-care workforce. We assume you know about the,217
NA,2010 intergenerational report which showed we need a 300 per cent increase in workers to,217
NA,"care for our ageing population by 2050. There are low wages, a lack of career pathways and a",217
NA,lack of professional development being experienced by the sector.,217
NA,NA,217
NA,I am eager to know how your government intends to ensure the workforce is there. We see,218
NA,a 25 per cent turnover in this sector; about 96 per cent of the people working in the sector are,218
NA,45 years of age and older; and about 75 per cent are from migrant backgrounds with 35 per,218
NA,"cent having lived in Australia for only five years or less. Minister, would you please explain",218
NA,how giving the workface supplement to aged-care providers with no conditionalities on,218
NA,"salaries, professional development, career paths or training will have anything to do with",218
NA,"addressing these alarming workforce concerns? Ian Yates, from the Council of the Ageing,",218
NA,stated:,218
NA,Giving aged-care providers back the aged care workforce supplement over five years will do nothing,218
NA,for the development of the aged care workforce.,218
NA,"Minister, in February this year you met with stakeholders in what was the forerunner to the",218
NA,aged-care sector committee. You said you would undertake a stock take of workforce,218
NA,development projects. I ask the minister to provide details of that stock take and outline which,218
NA,"projects have been cut in the budget, which you intend to propose to cut and which will",218
NA,remain. How will you address these specific concerns and additional pressures the sector is,218
NA,experiencing in regional and rural areas?,218
NA,I would also like the minister to outline what alternatives to removing all conditionality,218
NA,were considered by the government. What recommendations did the aged-care sector,218
NA,"committee make to you? Further, Minister, you answered none of my questions on modelling",218
NA,concerning the aged care payroll tax supplement and addressed none of the issues I raised,218
NA,"previously except to say that payroll tax was a matter for the states. In fact, your government",218
NA,has breached the long-held bipartisan approach to the issue of competitive neutrality in the,218
NA,"aged-care sector in an unsurprising move, I would say, because your government has had no",218
NA,regard for the aged-care sector since it has been elected.,218
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:20): The honourable,218
NA,member opposite has a very short memory. As I recall-and I was about and he was not-it,218
NA,was the Howard government that actually moved the very substantial changes to aged care in,218
NA,"Australia. It took it out of a cottage industry and into the modern, sophisticated sector that it is",218
NA,today. I encourage the honourable member opposite to have perhaps a closer check with the,218
NA,history of what has happened in this regard.,218
NA,"Coming to the question of the Aged Care Workforce Supplement, I can tell the honourable",218
NA,"member opposite that the five years from 2013-14, $1.5 billion will be redirected to providers",218
NA,"through a number of measures. Firstly, a 2.4 per cent increase in care subsidies and grant",218
NA,payments for eligible aged-care programs from 1 July 2014. All programs previously eligible,218
NA,for the workforce supplement will receive this funding. These increases are on top of normal,218
NA,indexation and will replace payments that would have been available under the previous,218
NA,workforce supplement.,218
NA,"Secondly, a 20 per cent-",218
NA,Mr Neumann interjecting-,218
Mr ANDREWS, Does the honourable member want to listen to the answer or not?,218
Mr Neumann, I want to know what answer you are-,218
Mr ANDREWS, I suggest you just be quiet and I will give you the rest of the answer!,218
NA,NA,218
NA,A 20 per cent increase to the viability supplement will be provided to improve the capacity,219
NA,"of over 950 services in regional, rural and remote areas to provide quality aged-care services.",219
NA,All services currently receiving the viability supplement will receive this increase.,219
NA,"Thirdly, additional payments will also be made to providers who committed to wage",219
NA,increases under the previous workforce supplement and who are financially disadvantaged by,219
NA,"the re-purposing of this funding and, fourthly, for funding already paid for the workforce",219
NA,supplement in 2013-14 through the transitional arrangements. The government will also roll,219
NA,"the conditional adjusted payment paid in residential care into basic care subsidies, including",219
NA,Aged Care Funding Instrument care subsidies. Providers will continue to receive the 8.75 per,219
NA,cent as part of the basic subsidy but will no longer need to complete the annual declaration or,219
NA,annual staff training statements.,219
NA,We will strengthen and expand the positive aspects of the cap by ensuring that all providers,219
NA,in programs that will receive the 2.4 per cent funding increase will now participate in the,219
NA,"National Aged Care Workforce Census and Survey, which occurs every three to four years.",219
NA,"And from 2015-16, financial reporting and programs receiving the 2.4 per cent funding",219
NA,"increase will be reviewed and, where relevant, strengthened based on advice from the Aged",219
NA,"Care Financing Authority. For 2014-15, providers will be still be required to provide financial",219
NA,statements as per current arrangements.,219
NA,"As to the workforce requirements, this government is well and truly aware of the workforce",219
NA,requirements. The basic foundation of this budget is one which actually recognises the ageing,219
NA,"of the population in Australia. It recognises the ageing of the population in Australia, and that",219
NA,is going to have a very significant impact on this country. Not only are there going to be,219
NA,"larger numbers of older Australians, largely more dependent than those who are in the",219
NA,"workforce, there is also going to be a shrinkage of the growth of the workforce in the future.",219
NA,"If you look at the major measures in this portfolio, for example, the measures to take the",219
NA,pension age up to 67 by 2023-which I admit the Labor Party was moving to-and to,219
NA,continue that trajectory to 70 by 2035 are a recognition of the ageing of the population.,219
NA,When the age pension was set in place in this country over a century ago -and there were,219
NA,"questions about this earlier-average life expectancy was less than 60. As I recall, it was",219
NA,"about 55 for men and about 59 for women. So this is recognition, if you like, of the major",219
NA,demographic shift-the seismic shift in the demography of this country-which will occur,219
NA,over the next 10 or 15 years. That is why we are doing things as we are in relation to the age-,219
NA,pension age in this country.,219
NA,"It is, equally, why we are saying to people under 30 that 'we expect you to earn or learn'. If",219
NA,"you do not meet the exemptions, which means you are not a full-time parent, or you are not",219
NA,"incapable of working for 30 hours or more a week, or you are not in training or in a range of",219
NA,"other exemptions-in other words, if you are capable of working full-time-then we expect",219
NA,"that you are in a job. But if you are not in a job and you are under 30, and you are not within",219
NA,"the exemptions, then because of this demographic shift our expectation is that you should be",219
NA,in training to get the job that you can have in the future because we will need every worker,219
NA,"we can find in the future. So far as the aged-care workforce is concerned, that is something",219
NA,"which is continuing to be monitored by the expert advisory committee, which advises",219
NA,Minister Fifield in that regard.,219
NA,NA,219
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Randall): As we are moving from the Social Services,220
NA,"section of this portfolio at 12.30 to the Human Services segment, out of goodwill I call the",220
NA,"member for Franklin, and the first person to be called to speak on Human Services will be",220
NA,from the government side.,220
Ms COLLINS ,"Franklin) (12:25): My questions relate to both, with a bit of a crossover, if",220
NA,"that is okay. My question is about the Newstart measures for the under 30s, how they are to",220
NA,apply and what is going on with this measure. I am particularly concerned about the,220
NA,"revelations in Senate estimates where the social services department confirmed that, with",220
NA,"penalties, some people will actually be up to 11 months with no payment whatsoever. Can the",220
NA,minister confirm that that is the case and explain to me how those penalties have come about,220
NA,and how we end up with 11 months with no payment?,220
NA,"I am also very particularly concerned about how this would apply to, say, a young woman",220
NA,under 30 who does not meet one of the exemptions but who finds herself in the early stages of,220
NA,pregnancy. Will she be exempt or will she face somewhere between six and 11 months of no,220
NA,payment whilst she is pregnant? What sort of analysis has the department or the government,220
NA,done of services that these people will need to rely on? I understand that there is some,220
NA,emergency relief money that has been quarantined but that this is not new money or,220
NA,additional money; it is actually existing money within the budget that has been put aside.,220
NA,What sorts of services and support are in place for these people to survive from six to 11,220
NA,"months with no money, particularly pregnant young women who may be caught up in this",220
NA,measure? We are very concerned on this side of the chamber about how this will apply and I,220
NA,would appreciate the minister giving a detailed and frank answer.,220
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:27): As the honourable,220
NA,"member opposite points out, there are a range of exemptions that apply to this earn-or-learn",220
NA,"measure: those with a work capacity of less than 30 hours a week, principal carers or parents",220
NA,"with 35 per cent or more care of a child, part-time apprentices, Disability Employment",220
NA,"Services clients, and stream 3 and 4 job seekers under employment services. They are the",220
NA,"ones who have the most difficulty in obtaining a job. So, as I said, this applies primarily to",220
NA,people who are capable of working full time-they are capable of working more than 30,220
NA,hours a week.,220
NA,Ms Collins interjecting-,220
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, Order! The member for Franklin has asked her question.,220
Mr ANDREWS, There are provisions that relate to pregnant women at the present time.,220
NA,As I recall those-but I am happy to come back to the honourable member with more detail-,220
NA,"they relate to the six-week period prior to giving birth, where there are exemptions in relation",220
NA,"to the obligations of a person in those circumstances. Those provisions will continue to apply,",220
NA,"but, if there is any further detail I can provide to the honourable member, I am happy to",220
NA,provide it after this.,220
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ," Mr Randall): It being almost 12.30, the Federation Chamber",220
NA,will now consider the Human Services segment of the Social Services portfolio in accordance,220
NA,with the agreed order of consideration.,220
Mr NIKOLIC ,Bass) (12:28): I again follow up with the minister on the Commonwealth,220
NA,seniors health card. The indexation of income thresholds for the card is obviously something,220
NA,NA,220
NA,that seniors advocates have been calling for for a long time. I am very pleased that the,221
NA,"measures have been finally put into the budget, something that those opposite had six years to",221
NA,do and never did. These measures will benefit seniors every year into the future.,221
NA,One other issue that has been brought up consistently within my electorate is the portability,221
NA,"of this card. Many self-funded retirees travel overseas to see friends and family and, despite",221
NA,"the fact that they do not receive income support payments, they are still limited to six weeks",221
NA,"before their card gets cancelled. That means that they have to reapply. It is a fairly long,",221
NA,"bureaucratic process, I am told, and results in some administrative overhang that, frankly,",221
NA,many think is not necessary. I would be interested to know: has the government considered,221
NA,the matter of extending the portability period of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card in,221
NA,this budget?,221
Mr ANDREWS ,"Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:29): Again, I commend the",221
NA,member for Bass for his interest on behalf of constituents in his electorate in relation to this,221
NA,"circumstance. Indeed, we have had representations about this matter and have taken those",221
NA,"representations into consideration. As a result of that, we have announced some changes in",221
NA,"the budget. Indeed, as I recall, one of the bills that were introduced into the parliament this",221
NA,"morning covers this matter. Portability will be increased from six weeks, as it currently is, to",221
NA,19 weeks in the budget legislation. That is more than a threefold increase in the portability,221
NA,"time, going from six to 19 weeks, and that will commence from 1 January 2015. So, from the",221
NA,"beginning of next year, there will be this increased portability period which will benefit those",221
NA,"people in that situation. It promotes greater certainty in their circumstances, and it reduces red",221
NA,"tape for the government, so it is a win-win situation both for those who are the recipients of",221
NA,this increased portability and for the government in terms of reducing red tape and the,221
NA,bureaucracy in relation to this matter. It acknowledges the contribution that self-funded,221
NA,"retirees have made to this nation, the fact that they have saved and worked throughout their",221
NA,entire lives. Self-funded retirees are a minority of the people in retirement in Australia. That is,221
NA,"the reality of the situation. This is a modest measure, indeed, but nonetheless a measure which",221
NA,seeks to recognise their great contribution over a long period of time.,221
Dr CHALMERS ,Rankin) (12:31): I want to clarify some matters for a lot of people in,221
NA,my electorate who will be showing up at Centrelink offices and other government offices,221
NA,"throughout the electorate. I have a low-SES community, and a lot of people show up in",221
NA,"person, so this has relevance to the Human Services part of the portfolio as well as the Social",221
NA,Services part of the portfolio. I remind the minister that ACOSS described this budget as a,221
NA,"budget to divide the nation, and I also remind him that this year there has been a really",221
NA,substantial drop-off in consumer confidence. Part of the reason for the drop-off in consumer,221
NA,"confidence was that the minister was running around the country, really from Christmas",221
NA,"onwards, talking about some sort of welfare crisis in the country, and a lot of people in my",221
NA,electorate certainly take deep offence at that.,221
NA,Mr Nikolic interjecting-,221
Dr CHALMERS, There is not a budget crisis either. These sorts of matters are probably,221
NA,"beyond the member for Bass, Deputy Speaker, but let me try and explain it to you anyway.",221
NA,"Minister, I am interested in particular by the HILDA Survey that was put out by the",221
NA,"Melbourne institute very recently, which showed that all the language around the welfare",221
NA,"crisis in this community is rubbish. It was just designed to scare people, to concoct this budget",221
NA,NA,221
NA,"emergency that does not exist, this big con, so that you can swing the axe harder at people in",222
NA,"my electorate by constructing this fake emergency, this welfare crisis. I remind him that",222
NA,"HILDA said that, in 2001, 23 per cent of working age people in Australia received a welfare",222
NA,"payment each week. In 2011, that had dropped to 18½ per cent. That is one fact. The other",222
NA,"fact is that welfare spending in Australia accounted for just 8.6 per cent of GDP in 2013,",222
NA,compared to the OECD average of 13 per cent.,222
NA,So my first question is: why does the minister think he knows more than the credible,222
NA,people who put together the HILDA Survey? On what planet is this minister more credible,222
NA,than the people who put together the HILDA Survey? That is my first question. The second,222
NA,"one relates to this whole thing-and, again, people will be fronting up to offices that he, as the",222
NA,"minister, administers and asking this question. They heard the Prime Minister say that there",222
NA,"would be no changes to pensions. Of course, there were. And now they hear the minister say",222
NA,and they hear the Prime Minister say that the pension has not been cut. My second question to,222
NA,"the minister, then, is: if the pension has not been cut, why do you claim on page 203 of your",222
NA,own budget papers-,222
NA,Mr Nikolic interjecting-,222
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ," Mr Randall): Member for Bass, please!",222
Dr CHALMERS, This bloke should have someone read the budget papers to him. I am,222
NA,happy to do that. The quote is:,222
NA,The Government will achieve savings of $449.0 million over five years by indexing pension and,222
NA,equivalent payments and Parenting Payment Single by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).,222
NA,"If there is no cut to the pension, where are you getting this $449 million from? If that figure is",222
NA,"wrong, will you issue a correction?",222
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:34): There is a crisis all,222
NA,"right. It is the crisis that your former employer, the member for Lilley, left this country in.",222
NA,That is the reality of the crisis-a debt of $667 billion. Talk about a crisis-$667 billion.,222
NA,Dr Chalmers interjecting-,222
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Member for Rankin, you have asked your question.",222
Mr ANDREWS, Were you the chief adviser for voodoo economics to your previous,222
NA,employer?,222
NA,Dr Chalmers interjecting-,222
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Member for Rankin, you have asked your question. If you",222
NA,"want an answer, allow the minister to answer.",222
Mr ANDREWS," So far as the age pension is concerned, I refer the honourable member to",222
NA,"page 69 of the portfolio budget statement, which shows, in relation to the age pension-this",222
NA,"comes back to the member for Jagajaga's questions as well-under, 'Expenses for income",222
NA,"support for seniors', age pension 2013-14, $39 billion; 2014-15, $41 billion; 2015-16, $44.5",222
NA,"billion; 2016-17, $47.5 billion; 2017-18, $49.5 billion. In other words, it is going from $39",222
NA,"billion to $49 billion, end of story.",222
NA,Dr Chalmers interjecting-,222
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Member for Rankin, I did ask you to give the minister",222
NA,courtesy. The minister has concluded.,222
NA,NA,222
NA,NA,223
NA,"welfare is welfare, the coalition believe that the best form of welfare is a job. A job brings",223
NA,"something to a person's life that welfare can never do. It brings responsibility,",223
NA,"accomplishment, social encouragement and, of course, financial benefits. These facts are true",223
NA,"for all Australians and, in particular, for people with disability. Australians with disability",223
NA,experience significantly lower workforce participation rates than Australians without,223
NA,disability. This means that Australians with disability do not get to experience the benefits,223
NA,"that a work life brings to one. Part of the reasons for this is that the DSP has been designed,",223
NA,"effectively, as a set-and-forget payment. People with a disability apply for the DSP, they get it",223
NA,and then we forget about them.,223
NA,I was pleased to see in the budget that the government is taking action to ensure that people,223
NA,with disability on the DSP are no longer forgotten. The members opposite asked me about my,223
NA,"constituents. Unlike some of the members opposite, I came to this place directly from the real",223
NA,world. I used to act invariably for people at the lowest end of the socioeconomic spectrum. I,223
NA,spent the majority of my professional life working for people on legal aid. I want to give an,223
NA,"example of one such constituent, whom I have maintained an excellent relationship with,",223
NA,"whom I had the pleasure of acting for in Mount Gambier. For current purposes, I will",223
NA,fictionally refer to him as 'Vince'.,223
NA,"I was acting for Vince in the Mount Gambier Magistrates Court. Courts, like this place, are",223
NA,"open to the public and to other people about to appear before magistrates. On this occasion, I",223
NA,"was presenting a guilty plea on behalf of Vince. Amongst other things, I made clear to the",223
NA,magistrate Vince's mild intellectual disability and that he was on the disability support,223
NA,"pension. Vince was built like the proverbial. In the gallery at court, awaiting proceedings, was",223
NA,"a significant employer in Barker. After I finished on that day, I got a phone call from this",223
NA,"employer, who said, 'Tony, that lad of yours that you acted for today-does he want a job?' I",223
NA,"said, 'Of course he does, but you've heard both his legal predicament and the issues with his",223
NA,"intellectual disability.' This employer said to me, 'Tony, I'm happy to offer him a job.' I am",223
NA,"pleased to report that that individual, many years later, remains in that employment. From",223
NA,"time to time, we catch up and he says to me, 'You know, I never thought I'd work. I thought",223
NA,I'd be on the disability support pension my whole life.',223
NA,"This is an example of two things: some people who are on the disability support pension,",223
NA,"particularly people under the age of 35, as Vince was, have the capacity to work, but, more",223
NA,"importantly, it indicated to me that there are employers who are ready, willing and able to",223
NA,offer employment to people with disability and give to them the dignity of employment that I,223
NA,"referred to. So, Minister, I ask this question: could you outline the government's policy to",223
NA,improve the social and economic participation of people with disability in our community?,223
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:39): I thank the member for,223
NA,"Barker for his question, and I commend him on his humanitarian outlook, which I have been",223
NA,"very impressed with, both in terms of his past life as a lawyer in Mount Gamier, and in the",223
NA,"qualities that he brings to his representation of the people of Barker. Indeed, I recall that",223
NA,during last year's Pollie Pedal I had a forum with the Prime Minister and with a number of,223
NA,disabled people and young carers in Barker. One of the announcements in the budget-of,223
NA,bursaries for young carers-directly arose out of that meeting that we had in Mount Gambier,223
NA,in the member's electorate just on a year ago.,223
NA,NA,223
NA,Representations like those that the member for Barker brings to this place about real issues,224
NA,"concerning real people are things which we in this government are listening to, and we will",224
NA,"continue to do so. I was in the electorate of Logan in southern Brisbane last week, where I",224
NA,"saw a very impressive operation employing disabled people, where a person who had worked",224
NA,in the abattoirs there had set up a commercial lawn-mowing business. All the people,224
NA,employed in that commercial lawn-mowing business are disabled. In that operation he,224
NA,employs something like a dozen or 15 people driving commercial lawnmowers. He has vast,224
NA,"contracts throughout the area for councils, parks and gardens, and things like that. All of those",224
NA,"young people, under the age of 35, had moved from being on the disability support pension,",224
NA,"onto full-time employment. That just shows that, if we have the desire, there is a way in",224
NA,which we can assist many disabled people.,224
NA,"When I meet with disabled people around this country-as we all have, over a long period",224
NA,of time-they invariably say that they would like to work. People want to participate. They,224
NA,want to be part of the life of this country. They want to be part of the economic life of this,224
NA,country. So we need to find ways to encourage them to do that.,224
NA,One of the measures in this budget is aimed directly at doing that. We are talking about,224
NA,"young people under the age of 35, who are on the DSP and who are capable of working more",224
NA,than seven or eight hours a work-so they can do some work-who are not manifestly,224
NA,disabled. We are not referring to people who quite clearly cannot work but people who are,224
NA,"capable, maybe, of doing some part-time work. In the past there has been a requirement that",224
NA,they have a participation plan but there was no requirement for them to follow it up. There,224
NA,was no requirement to go and do some work experience if that was what was in the,224
NA,participation plan. There was no requirement to undertake some form of training if that was,224
NA,"what was in the participation plan. So in this measure we are proposing that people on DSP,",224
NA,"under 35, who are capable of doing some part-time work, should have a participation plan and",224
NA,that we should follow up that participation plan with them. In that way we would encourage,224
NA,them to get into work if that is what they are capable of.,224
NA,"This is not going to affect their DSP, so they will still have that safety net. I remember the",224
NA,changes we made back in 2005 in relation to DSP. One of the things that people were,224
NA,concerned about was that if employment did not work out for them the safety net would still,224
NA,be there. That is something which I think is very important in this regard.,224
Ms ROWLAND ,"Greenway) (12:43): The items I would like to raise, please, relate to",224
NA,clarifying the status and delineation of some specific grants that fall within the minister's,224
NA,"purview. As I am sure the minister is well aware, some of these programs have moved",224
NA,"between portfolios-possibly between Human Services, Social Services and Immigration.",224
NA,I have had the pleasure of travelling around many parts of the country visiting a range of,224
NA,"migrant resource centres and settlement service providers, and I am sure we all agree that",224
NA,"these organisations do outstanding work in our community, particularly in helping new",224
NA,arrivals establish themselves in our community. These organisations give the new arrivals not,224
NA,only a sense of inclusiveness but a very real connection to their new country. The strong,224
NA,message I am receiving from many of these organisations is that there is currently a lack of,224
NA,clarity or certainty in relation to some specific grants in the settlement and multicultural,224
NA,services space in particular. I have conveyed these concerns to the minister's parliamentary,224
NA,"secretary. The response I received was pre the budget, which is why I am seeking an update",224
NA,NA,224
NA,now. I wrote to the parliamentary secretary on 1 April stating that several multicultural,225
NA,organisations and migrant resource centres had contacted me expressing concern about the,225
NA,future of the Settlement Grants Program. I asked if the parliamentary secretary could confirm,225
NA,that the Settlement Grants Program was safe and would not be removed or have substantial,225
NA,amounts of funding cut from it in the upcoming budget. I said this information would be,225
NA,greatly appreciated so these organisations could be assured this program would continue to,225
NA,operate. The parliamentary secretary replied on 7 May. The primary paragraph in that,225
NA,"response said: 'As you would be aware, the Australian government is committed to reviewing",225
NA,all spending across government. As soon as the Department of Social Services is in a position,225
NA,to provide advice on the future funding arrangements it will do so without delay.',225
NA,I note there was a document that was released with the budget and that the Department of,225
NA,Social Services and the government are working on new ways of delivering grant funding in a,225
NA,"range of areas. But I am sure, as the minister will appreciate, this uncertainty is not beneficial",225
NA,"to many of these organisations around the country who are trying to plan for the future,",225
NA,including for their existing staff and their future staffing levels. So I am seeking some clarity,225
NA,"on these matters that can be communicated to these people. As an example, I note the",225
NA,Settlement Council of Australia commentary on the budget. The council said in a newsletter,225
NA,that its members were eagerly awaiting the announcement of the federal budget this year to,225
NA,gain clarity on the funding of settlement services within the portfolio of the Department of,225
NA,"Social Services. DSS yesterday, in line with the budget announcement, released information",225
NA,"entitled 'DSS Grants-A New Way of Working', which I have alluded to. The council says",225
NA,"there are significant cuts to the Strengthening Communities program, which was concerning,",225
NA,and refers to DSS program information on the settlement services within the new grant,225
NA,"arrangements with the grant structure including longer grant terms, simplified reporting and",225
NA,acquittal processes.,225
NA,The DSS website states they will be offering extensions to the majority of existing service,225
NA,providers with agreements due to finish by 30 June 2014. The feedback I keep getting is about,225
NA,"people not knowing, beyond that date, about what is going to happen from that time forward.",225
NA,The Settlement Council's newsletter says the council looks forward to working with the,225
NA,government and DSS to understand and implement the new grant arrangements within the,225
NA,settlement sector. It also says greater security of funding will enable the settlement sector to,225
NA,continue to build on the proud record of the world's leading service delivery to newly arrived,225
NA,migrants and refugees. I would reiterate those remarks.,225
NA,My question to the minister is about the Strengthening Communities line item in the,225
NA,budget. Can the minister detail all the specific grant programs and funding items impacted by,225
NA,the $33 million cut to the Strengthening Communities line item as stated on page 98 of the,225
NA,"Social Services portfolio budget statement? As I said, many stakeholders are saying it is not",225
NA,clear to them what individual line items are included in that funding envelope so that they can,225
NA,"plan for the future, particularly beyond this financial year.",225
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:48): What we have sought,225
NA,to do with program grants is to reduce the number of areas so that a smaller number of areas,225
NA,"include all the various program grants in the future. In relation to settlement services, they",225
NA,"will continue. Indeed, the funding for future years will be greater than it has been for this",225
NA,"year, which you will see if you look again at page 98 of the portfolio budget statement which",225
NA,NA,225
NA,you referred to. Settlement services are safe as part of the change bringing settlement services,226
NA,and multicultural matters from the immigration department into the Department of Social,226
NA,"Services. This is the new structure, if I can be permitted for a moment to show this to the",226
NA,"honourable member, and we can provide a copy of it if the honourable member does not have",226
NA,it. It shows quite clearly that settlement services is part of this new structure. What we are,226
NA,trying to do is to reduce red tape to cut down and make more efficient the way in which,226
NA,programs are operating.,226
NA,"My recollection is that the grants round under DSS will open on 19 June this year, so there",226
NA,will be the opportunity for organisations to apply for grants under that. Part of what we are,226
NA,"trying to do, not immediately in every area but over time, is to have grants that go for a longer",226
NA,time in terms of years so there is a great deal more certainty for the organisations and the staff,226
NA,employed by those organisations in the future.,226
Ms ROWLAND ,"Greenway) (12:50): Thank you for that, Minister. My question was that",226
NA,I would just like to know-,226
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Randall): You cannot have supplementaries.,226
Ms ROWLAND, My question was what the specific items-,226
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," No, sorry. You cannot ask a further question.",226
Ms ROWLAND, It is the same question.,226
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," No, you have asked your question in your time.",226
Ms HENDERSON ,Corangamite) (12:50): The National Disability Insurance Scheme is,226
NA,arguably one of the most significant programs in the history of the Australian government. It,226
NA,is with great celebration in my community in Geelong and in Colac that we have begun to roll,226
NA,out the NDIS.,226
NA,"In fact, I was in Colac on Friday and visited the new office of the Colac National Disability",226
NA,"Insurance Scheme and I met with the National Disability Insurance Agency area coordinator,",226
NA,Schree Barry. It really is wonderful to see the investment that is happening in the Colac,226
NA,community and across the Greater Geelong region in my electorate of Corangamite. I am a,226
NA,passionate supporter of the NDIS and this government is a passionate supporter of the NDIS.,226
NA,We have supported the NDIS at every step of the way and we remain committed to rolling out,226
NA,the NDIS in full.,226
NA,It really is fantastic to see that already the NDIA and the scheme that underpins the NDIA,226
NA,"are helping some 2,700 people in the Barwon region in the trial that is being conducted in",226
NA,Barwon. In Colac alone there are about 340 people who have done their plans and are in the,226
NA,"process of having these important disability services delivered, obviously, to people with a",226
NA,disability and their families.,226
NA,This is making a profound difference. There are six people working in Colac and there are,226
NA,another five people to come. The Colac Herald did a terrific little article about the new office,226
NA,"that is opening today, and that is a great investment. So there is great excitement in Colac",226
NA,about the investment that the federal government is making in the National Disability,226
NA,Insurance Scheme.,226
NA,"Of course, it was with great pride on 30 April that Prime Minister Tony Abbott, along with",226
NA,"Premier Denis Napthine, officially opened the new national headquarters of the NDIA. The",226
NA,NA,226
NA,NDIA will generate about 450 direct jobs in total for Geelong by 2019-20. Already there have,227
NA,been some 125 jobs created and that number is expected to rise to 300. So not only is this a,227
NA,"wonderful scheme for people with a disability, their families and their carers; it is also",227
NA,wonderful for jobs in our region-it is so positive for jobs in our region.,227
NA,Already we are seeing what a difference this is making. A number of weeks ago I visited,227
NA,"Kids Plus Foundation in Geelong. This is a wonderful agency, giving help to young children",227
NA,"and to babies, principally those with cystic fibrosis and other similar conditions. Up until",227
NA,recently they have had no government funding and now with parents coming along with their,227
NA,NDIS packages under the trial they are getting incredible help. So it is wonderful to see what,227
NA,a significant difference this is making in the Corangamite community and across the Greater,227
NA,Geelong region.,227
NA,"And let us not forget that from 1 July 2014, NDIS trial sites will be in place across all",227
NA,states and territories except Queensland. Queensland will join the NDIS in 2016. New NDIS,227
NA,"trials in Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will",227
NA,"assist around 14,000 people with permanent and significant disability, and more than 35,000",227
NA,"people with disability will be assisted through the NDIS trials. Once fully rolled out, the",227
NA,"NDIS will assist around 460,000 Australians with a permanent and significant disability, at a",227
NA,cost of $22 billion. So this is a wonderful initiative. I am so proud that we are funding this,227
NA,program and that we are getting on with the job of looking after people with a disability.,227
NA,I ask the minister today to confirm the government's commitment to the NDIS over the,227
NA,forward estimates and confirm that this is a fully funded policy. Can the minister also confirm,227
NA,that the government has reversed the previous government's decision to apply the efficiency,227
NA,dividend to NDIS support packages and the second development fund?,227
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies-Minister for Social Services) (12:55): I commend the,227
NA,member for Corangamite for her great interest in the NDIS-the National Disability,227
NA,Insurance Scheme. The location of the NDIA-the authority which is responsible for the,227
NA,scheme-is in Geelong. Her electorate of Corangamite includes part of the great city of,227
NA,"Geelong, a very impressive and booming city in Victoria as far as a number of these sorts of",227
NA,services is concerned. Her consideration for this is something which is very significant.,227
NA,"The member for Corangamite talked about Colac. I travel everywhere by bike, and the last",227
NA,"time I was in Colac I was on my bike as well. Indeed, I met with a group of carers and a group",227
NA,of people interested in disability there. We met at one of the motels in Colac on a Saturday or,227
NA,Sunday morning. There was a large group of people there who were very concerned about,227
NA,these issues regarding disability. On that occasion the Prime Minister and I spent some time,227
NA,with them listening to their stories and what they were concerned about. This was at a time,227
NA,before the NDIS had actually been thought of and brought into operation. It is for those sorts,227
NA,"of people, their families, their carers and their friends that the NDIS is a scheme whose time",227
NA,has come.,227
NA,I pay tribute to the previous government for their commitment to the NDIS. This is,227
NA,something that has been bipartisan in Australia. It is one of those things which happens only,227
NA,every so often in this country where a major social change has come about. We are in the,227
NA,throes of the implementation of it. It is going to take a number of years. The honourable,227
NA,member talked about the trials which are occurring in the Barwon region in Victoria and,227
NA,elsewhere around the country. The whole purpose of those trials is to provide us with the,227
NA,NA,227
NA,information that can help us to roll out this scheme in a way that will work for the people that,228
NA,is aimed to work for.,228
NA,The Productivity Commission identified some hundreds of thousands of people who this,228
NA,"was intended to apply to. The reality in Australia is that, if you are injured as a result of a",228
NA,"vehicular accident, state accident compensation schemes around the country apply to those",228
NA,"people. But, if you have a disability through some other cause-through no fault of your",228
NA,own-the reality was that you were not in the same situation as an individual or as family and,228
NA,friends of people injured in that sort of accident. This is aimed at providing equality of,228
NA,"treatment, if I can put it that way, and equality of outcomes in terms of the care that can be",228
NA,provided for people who have a disability.,228
NA,This is a very important development and it is going to take time. There is a parliamentary,228
NA,"committee that oversees this process, which the Labor Party, the coalition and others are",228
NA,"involved in, because we believe-and we argued this for a long time in the parliament-that",228
NA,this is too important to just be the subject of partisan politics. That is why when we were in,228
NA,opposition we threw our support behind this proposal and that is why now in government we,228
NA,are fully committed to the rollout of it.,228
NA,The member for Corangamite mentioned the efficiency dividend. The reality is that there,228
NA,was an efficiency divided applied to the NDIS and this was something which we thought was,228
NA,"inappropriate in relation to a commitment to rolling out this scheme. In this budget, the",228
NA,efficiency dividend of $44.9 million-which was effectively a cut to the NDIS-has been,228
NA,reversed. I think that is a clear indication that this government is fully committed to the,228
NA,rollout of the NDIS.,228
NA,If anybody anywhere in Australia ever suggests that the coalition is not committed to the,228
NA,"NDIS, they are, frankly, telling porkies. We are committed to the NDIS. We will see it rolled",228
NA,out. We do not underestimate the difficulties involved in the rollout of this scheme. That is,228
NA,why the trial sites are so important to provide the learnings for us over the next few years as,228
NA,to how this can best work. Already there are some results in from the first couple of quarters,228
NA,from various trial sites around the country. Some of those results have been mixed. What we,228
NA,"have to learn from that is whether or not, for example, the results which are not as good as we",228
NA,might have thought are simply a product of the start-up of a new system and whether or not,228
NA,these things will be ironed out over time or whether they are longer term issues that need to be,228
NA,addressed in terms of how the system is put into operation. But I assure the member for,228
NA,"Corangamite, who is a great supporter of the NDIS, and all members of this House and the",228
NA,parliament and the people of Australia that the coalition is 100 per cent committed to the,228
NA,implementation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.,228
NA,Proposed expenditure agreed to.,228
NA,Proceedings suspended from 13:00 to 15:59,228
NA,Education Portfolio,228
NA,"Proposed expenditure, $1,329,516,000",228
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Ewen Jones): The question is that the proposed,228
NA,expenditure be agreed to.,228
NA,"Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (16:00): To clarify, I understand that we will be covering",228
NA,"higher education, schools and early childhood in the next hour and a half. We propose that we",228
NA,NA,228
NA,will commence with higher education for the first 45-odd minutes before moving to schools,229
NA,and child care.,229
NA,We have a number of questions to put to the minister about these appalling attacks on our,229
NA,"university and higher education sector. Of course, the Australian public know all too well that",229
NA,"they were promised no cuts to education, but in higher education alone we know that this",229
NA,package is such a shambles that it is cutting some $5.8 billion from higher education. We also,229
NA,"know that, whilst the education minister repeatedly refers to expanding opportunities for",229
NA,"80,000 extra students, there is no new funding for 80,000 new students-not at all. What the",229
NA,government is planning to do is extend government subsidies to more students by spreading,229
NA,less money more thinly across a greater number of students. This is a preposterous policy,229
NA,position which the minister has put forward. We certainly welcome the opportunity to,229
NA,reiterate some of the concerns which have been raised in the sector but also to ask some,229
NA,questions on how this will be implemented.,229
NA,"I want to share some of the views not just of students, parents and grandparents but of vice-",229
NA,chancellors within the sector already. We know that they have come out in waves against,229
NA,"these higher education changes, arguing particularly that these changes will hurt their",229
NA,"students. The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, in the great electorate of",229
NA,"Adelaide, which I am so lucky to represent, says that aspects of these changes are",229
NA,"unworkable, they are unduly harsh and:",229
NA,"The compounding interest here [means] we might deliver debts to students of $70,000, $80,000,",229
NA,"$100,000 and no-one here wanted that.",229
NA,"We have also, of course, seen the HECS architect, Dr Bruce Chapman, warning that changes",229
NA,could lead to profiteering and stating:,229
NA,If universities have price discretion they will all take it … and could actually end up charging more than,229
NA,what it actually costs-,229
NA,to deliver that education.,229
NA,"The University of Canberra's vice-chancellor, Stephen Parker, said:",229
NA,I also think it is unethical for a generation of leaders who by and large benefited from free higher,229
NA,education to burden the generations behind them …,229
NA,The Swinburne University vice-chancellor trashed this package when she said:,229
NA,"Deregulation will inevitably lead to much higher fees for our students. Over time, full fee deregulation",229
NA,will lead to a higher education system characterised by the 'haves' and the 'have nots'.,229
NA,"There are many, many other stakeholders who have given damning appraisals of this",229
NA,"ludicrous policy put forward by the education minister, but I will not take up the time of the",229
NA,chamber at this point to share all of these many quotes. What I will instead do is ask some,229
NA,"questions of the minister, which I hope that he will be able to address in his next contribution.",229
NA,How does the government justify higher education deregulation in the face of so much,229
NA,opposition? Has the government done any modelling on the impact of deregulated higher fees,229
NA,on students and on the broader economy here in Australia? Does the government envisage,229
NA,universities will use the international student fee rate as their maximum rate and has this been,229
NA,included in modelling? If some universities charge much higher fees than other so-called less,229
NA,"prestigious universities, does the government concede that this will lead to a two-tiered",229
NA,system and price students out of certain universities? Doesn't this challenge Australia's current,229
NA,NA,229
NA,"system of fair and equitable access to education? It is unthinkable that the government can, on",230
NA,"the one hand, argue that some universities' fees may go up and, as they like to keep saying,",230
NA,"that some universities' fees may go down and, on the other hand, not concede that this leads to",230
NA,our national system becoming a two-tiered system at least. I would like to know whether this,230
NA,"is the minister's view? And, if not, what modelling has been conducted on the Australian",230
NA,"education sector, in Australia, that he can fall back on to guarantee that that will not be the",230
NA,case?,230
NA,NA,230
NA,shadow minister's opening remarks were not so much a question as they were a political,230
NA,statement. But I will pick up some of the things that she said in her speech. I am sure then that,230
NA,members of the coalition might want to make a contribution and I will respond to those as,230
NA,well.,230
NA,The shadow minister asked a series of loaded questions. Let me explain a little bit about the,230
NA,"education package in the budget. First of all, there are no cuts to education in this budget-",230
NA,"none whatsoever. Over the next four years, higher education increases every year to the point",230
NA,where we will have $900 million more in spending over the next four years in higher,230
NA,education. And there are some elements of the new spending proposals that the shadow,230
NA,"minister did not touch on. Obviously, we were met with several funding cliffs when we came",230
NA,to power. The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy was one of those,230
NA,funding cliffs where Labor had extended the scheme for 12 months and it was an ending,230
NA,program. We were faced with letting that program end or finding the money in the budget to,230
NA,continue it because of the very good work that NCRIS does. I am sure that the member for,230
NA,Adelaide would agree that NCRIS is a very worthwhile scheme to support research,230
NA,"infrastructure. I and, I am sure, the member for Adelaide, have visited some of the",230
NA,outstanding examples of where NCRIS is making a difference to research in Australia.,230
NA,"Well, we found that money and we continued to fund NCRIS into the future. We did the",230
NA,"same thing with the Future Fellowships program, a program that typically is for mid-career",230
NA,"researchers, to ensure that once they have passed through the early stages of being a",230
NA,"researcher we do not lose them overseas, poached by excellent universities around the",230
NA,globe-that we can continue to use the skills that they are developing here in Australia.,230
NA,Anyone who attended the Prime Minister's Science Awards at the end of last year would note,230
NA,that a number of the winners were mid-career researchers who had benefited under the Future,230
NA,Fellowships scheme.,230
NA,Labor again-,230
NA,Ms MACTiernan: This won't lead to their mid-careers because you have cut off the,230
NA,resources-,230
NA,NA,230
NA,recognise the member for Perth from her posters in the last election campaign. I do not think,230
NA,that she would want to be involved in any misleading or deceptive conduct cases. I think she,230
NA,would find herself to be on the wrong side of the law.,230
NA,Ms MACTiernan interjecting-,230
NA,NA,230
NA,election campaign? They look nothing like you!,230
NA,NA,230
NA,Ms MACTiernan interjecting-,231
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Ewen Jones): Order!,231
NA,Ms MACTiernan interjecting-,231
NA,NA,231
NA,Ms MACTiernan interjecting-,231
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, Order! The member for Perth! This is the Federation,231
NA,Chamber! The member for Adelaide was listened to in quiet and silence and you can listen to,231
NA,"the answer in silence, thank you very much.",231
NA,NA,231
NA,"Future Fellowships program. I am sure she supports the Future Fellowships program, because",231
NA,I would imagine that UWA-,231
NA,Ms MACTiernan interjecting-,231
NA,NA,231
NA,"Perth's electorate. It might be the member for Curtin's electorate, but I am sure she supports",231
NA,mid-career researchers being supported. And I am pleased to say that in the budget process I,231
NA,was able to secure the funds to keep the Future Fellowships program going into the future.,231
NA,"So, to clear up the first of the member for Adelaide's assertions about cuts to higher",231
NA,education: spending on higher education increases in this budget. The total higher education,231
NA,"research international and agency spending over the next four years is $48.3 billion, and it is",231
NA,increasing by $900 million. That is an enormous investment by the federal government in,231
NA,higher education and research because we very much value higher education and research.,231
NA,"We have, of course, as part of the budget introduced higher education reforms. There are",231
NA,eight key elements and I will touch on a couple. I would have hoped that the member for,231
NA,Adelaide would support the expansion of the demand-driven system to the sub-bachelor,231
NA,courses-the diplomas and the associate degrees-because that is a new spending measure,231
NA,that is costing the government money. It is costing us $371.5 million over three years. That,231
NA,"will give, typically, low-SES students-first-generation university goers-an opportunity to",231
NA,go to university and to get that pathway into an undergraduate degree that will give them the,231
NA,"chance to earn 75 per cent, on average, more over their lifetimes because they have a higher",231
NA,education qualification. So that is just one element of the budget measures. As my time has,231
NA,"expired, I might turn to the others the next time I get an opportunity.",231
Ms MACTIERNAN ,Perth) (16:10): I have a couple of questions I would like to ask the,231
NA,minister. It is about the funding cuts to the subsidies for different programs. I must say that I,231
NA,was quite stunned to see the extent of the cuts of the subsidy for both engineering and science.,231
NA,Both of these undergraduate courses have now sustained cuts of 28 per cent. That seems to be,231
NA,a very peculiar position to adopt at a time when I think we would all acknowledge that we,231
NA,need to really ramp up the skills that we have in the nation in engineering and in science. If,231
NA,we are to be a successful nation into the future we are really going to need to skill up in those,231
NA,particular areas. Could you tell us just what your thinking was and what you think the impact,231
NA,"might be from these very, very significant cuts to those particular disciplines-bearing in",231
NA,"mind that I think you would understand, Minister, that science graduates do not necessarily",231
NA,generate massive income. It is not as if we are going to be seeing enormous earning potential.,231
NA,NA,231
NA,"Indeed, with the 457 visas, even Australian engineering graduates are having trouble earning",232
NA,a decent living these days. I am really concerned about that. I would like you to address what,232
NA,you think and what impact you believe this will have on people electing to go into those areas,232
NA,and indeed the provision of those courses by universities.,232
NA,You were talking of the work you have done to increase the mid-career opportunities for,232
NA,graduates. Could you give us more explanation of why then you have so extensively ramped,232
NA,up the cost of the PhD and master's by research? We have seen a cut to that area of $173,232
NA,"million. I understand that this now equates to very, very significant increases in costs to those",232
NA,"PhD students. Okay, we have put a little bit of money into the mid-career, but what I am",232
NA,concerned about is that we have really made it much more challenging for people to come in,232
NA,and do undergraduate degrees in science and engineering and then at that next level-those,232
NA,that want to go on to masters and doctorates-are now seeing their fees increased,232
NA,substantially. That is obviously going to be a disincentive and disabler for those people who,232
NA,"are not independently wealthy, like so many of the minister's colleagues, apparently. I would",232
NA,ask that you would address those two issues.,232
NA,NA,232
NA,for Perth asks about what I think will be the impact on universities of the government's,232
NA,deregulatory approach in the budget. The member for Perth has to understand that this is an,232
NA,entire package of reform. There are elements of it in which the taxpayers will be making,232
NA,savings. So the Commonwealth Grant Scheme will be reduced by 20 per cent. That is,232
NA,definitely true. There have to be trade-offs in the budget for expenses to the taxpayer versus,232
NA,"savings to the taxpayer. So while we are, as I said before, increasing spending on things like",232
NA,NCRIS and Future Fellowships and the demand-driven system being expanded to the sub-,232
NA,bachelor courses and of course the Commonwealth Grant Scheme being expanded to the non-,232
NA,"university higher education providers, there will be a cut of 20 per cent to the Commonwealth",232
NA,Grant Scheme across the board. I refer the member to the fact that I have established two,232
NA,working groups. One of the working groups will be giving advice to me in the coming weeks,232
NA,about the technical aspects of the clustering arrangements that she talked about. I am looking,232
NA,forward to getting its response.,232
NA,Ms MACTiernan: So you actually don't know what the impact will be.,232
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Ewen Jones): Order! You have asked your question.,232
NA,NA,232
NA,"young people will get the opportunity to go to university-a lot more, at least 80,000 more.",232
NA,"That was the question asked by the member for Perth, and that is the answer. Eighty thousand",232
NA,more people will get to go to university and get the opportunity to improve their standard of,232
NA,"living, their health, their longevity and their sophistication, if you like, through education, and",232
NA,"they will get a 75 per cent, on average, increase in income. The taxpayer provides, at the",232
NA,"moment, about 60 per cent of the cost of educating a student. The student provides about 40",232
NA,"per cent. After our reforms, the impact will be that we will be asking students to contribute",232
NA,"about 50 per cent of the cost of their education. As Fred Hilmer, from the University of New",232
NA,"South Wales, said, the government will not set these fees. The government will not decide",232
NA,"how the universities determine their budgets, their costs and their fees. The universities will",232
NA,decide that.,232
NA,NA,232
NA,The member for Perth wants to continue to infantilise the universities. She wants to,233
NA,continue to run the universities from Canberra in terms of the demand-driven system. She,233
NA,probably wants to return to the old system of caps on undergraduate courses. She wants to tell,233
NA,the universities how they can much they can charge and how many students they can enrol.,233
NA,The government's view is that we want to give universities the freedom to make these,233
NA,"decisions themselves, to set their own fees and to enrol the number of students that they want",233
NA,in sub-bachelor courses and undergraduate degrees. The effect of that is a massive reform of,233
NA,"higher education that will have two very significant impacts. Firstly, it will let more young",233
NA,people into higher education. This will particularly help low-SES families and first-generation,233
NA,"university goers, because they typically use the sub-bachelor courses as a pathway to an",233
NA,undergraduate degree.,233
NA,"The second big impact, which the Labor Party is also opposed to, is that it will give our",233
NA,universities the chance to achieve excellence. It will give our universities the chance to,233
NA,"compete with their Asian competitors, the Asian universities, which are improving in quality",233
NA,"all the time. We have an international education market, which at the moment is worth $15",233
NA,billion per annum. It was $19 billion under the Howard government. Labor managed to shrink,233
NA,that to $15 billion-quite an achievement in a growing economy-because they do not really,233
NA,support international education. We want to see our universities compete with their Asian,233
NA,"counterparts. Five years ago, there were no Chinese universities in the top 200 universities in",233
NA,"the world, in the Shanghai Jiao Tong index-none. There are now five universities from",233
NA,"China in the top 200. Of the Australian universities, one more has entered the top 200, but all",233
NA,the others' rankings have fallen.,233
NA,"If we do not give our universities the chance to achieve excellence, to compete with their",233
NA,"Asian competitors, our international education market will fall and it will dry up. I am not",233
NA,prepared to be the minister that knows that danger is looming and not do anything about it. So,233
NA,I have made the decision to reform higher education to give more students the opportunity to,233
NA,go to university and to free our universities to be the best they possibly can be and to have the,233
NA,best quality higher education system in the world.,233
Ms SCOTT ,"Lindsay) (16:18): I have a question for the Minister for Education. Firstly, I",233
NA,"would like to give some context for the minister. As the minister would be aware, Lindsay is",233
NA,"home to the University of Western Sydney, consisting of 40,000 students across six",233
NA,"campuses, with its chancellery housed within my electorate of Lindsay. This great university",233
NA,prides itself on its vision:,233
NA,"To be a university of international standing and outlook, achieving excellence through scholarship,",233
NA,"teaching, learning, research and service to its regional, national and international communities,",233
NA,beginning with the people of Greater Western Sydney,233
NA,I am sure you can see many parallels with what the minister is achieving in the budget.,233
NA,UWS is a very responsible university. It wants to encourage people right across Western,233
NA,Sydney to learn and to enrol in tertiary education and has broadly welcomed the government's,233
NA,"measures. As a response to the intense scare campaign conducted by those opposite, UWS has",233
NA,felt compelled to provide further confidence to their student community and has publicly,233
NA,come out to say that they will be freezing and grandfathering course costs to the student,233
NA,"community. However, I would like to know how the minister's budget measures will",233
NA,overcome other potential barriers to accessing a tertiary education.,233
NA,NA,233
NA,I would also like to advise the minister that Lindsay is the fourth youngest electorate in,234
NA,"Australia. It is predominantly made up of many young, aspirational and hardworking families,",234
NA,"working to provide a better future for their children, but there are elements of significant",234
NA,"disparity in Lindsay. In Glenmore Park, for instance, in the south-west of the electorate, the",234
NA,"median income for a couple with children is $2,474, which is higher than the New South",234
NA,"Wales average. Further, 33.5 per cent of people are attending some form of educational",234
NA,"institution, be it primary, secondary or tertiary, and 11.1 per cent are currently enrolled in",234
NA,"university or tertiary education. To the west of my electorate is North St Marys, about 13",234
NA,kilometres from Glenmore Park. The average income there of a household with children is,234
NA,"$1,935, which is $539 per week less than in Glenmore Park and lower than the New South",234
NA,"Wales average. In North St Marys, 33.8 per cent of people are attending an academic",234
NA,"institution. North St Marys is also home to a high school called Chifley College, which is the",234
NA,lowest SES school in the state: Chifley College Dunheven Campus has a lot of Aboriginal,234
NA,"children and also refugee children and has many, many challenges. Only 5.1 per cent of this",234
NA,"community go on to tertiary education. Let me repeat: in Glenmore Park, 11.1 per cent of",234
NA,"people are currently enrolled in tertiary education; in North St Marys, 5.1 per cent. This is",234
NA,despite North St Marys being closer to the local university campus.,234
NA,"Minister, I understand that with a university education more opportunities become",234
NA,"available and your earning potential is substantially higher. In fact, those students will go on",234
NA,to earn 75 per cent more on average than Australians who do not get a higher education,234
NA,qualification. I understand in low-socioeconomic regions there are a range of contributing,234
NA,"factors and barriers to accessing education. However, with the disparity I have identified",234
NA,"within my own electorate, I think there is a need to make a university education more",234
NA,"accessible. Minister, the disparities between the two suburbs could not be clearer. My",234
NA,question is: how will the higher education reforms outlined in the budget increase,234
NA,opportunities for students in my electorate?,234
NA,NA,234
NA,member for Lindsay for her contribution. I can remind her that it was not very long ago that I,234
NA,was out in Western Sydney opening the University of Western Sydney College. Peter,234
NA,"Shergold, who is the Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, is the chairman of one",234
NA,of the working groups that are advising the government on the legislative framework for the,234
NA,"reforms that we handed down in the budget. He is doing an excellent job, as are all the vice-",234
NA,chancellors and educators who are assisting the government to bring about very far-reaching,234
NA,higher education reform. I can tell her that Greater Western Sydney will be one of the biggest,234
NA,winners from the government's higher education reforms.,234
NA,One of the points that the member for Adelaide made before was that she tried to suggest,234
NA,that somehow we would be stopping young people from being able to access university,234
NA,"through these reforms. What she failed to mention, but I know that the community understand",234
NA,"already, is that every single student, whether in Greater Western Sydney or in Walkerville in",234
NA,"her electorate, will be able to borrow every single dollar up-front for the fees that they will",234
NA,pay to go to university. No student will be denied the opportunity to go to university because,234
NA,of cost-not one-because every single dollar can be borrowed from the taxpayer under the,234
NA,"Higher Education Loan Program, which used to be the Higher Education Contribution",234
NA,Scheme introduced by Labor-by Minister Dawkins in the Keating and Hawke years-when,234
NA,NA,234
NA,they had some policy consistency and some policy responsibility. That means that no matter,235
NA,"how wealthy you are or how poor you are, you will have exactly the same opportunity to go",235
NA,to university in this country. That is why our system is so very different from the system in,235
NA,the United States. To compare the two is a very false comparison and is extremely,235
NA,misleading.,235
NA,"It does shock me that, in the electorate of the member for Lindsay, Glenmore Park has 11.1",235
NA,per cent and North St Marys has 5.1 per cent of people enrolled in tertiary education. The,235
NA,University of Western Sydney is an extremely important part of the economic and social,235
NA,"fabric of Greater Western Sydney, with its six campuses and it's very determined vision of",235
NA,"spreading the benefits of university education to the demographic in that part of Sydney,",235
NA,which is a low-socioeconomic status demographic. Our reforms will mean that people in,235
NA,North St Marys who might not be as well prepared for university education as others and who,235
NA,typically use pathway courses into university will be able to do so because we are lifting the,235
NA,"cap on those pathways courses, those diplomas and associate degrees. They will now be under",235
NA,the same demand-driven system as undergraduate degrees. It is costing the Australian,235
NA,taxpayer to bring that about.,235
NA,We know that the people in Western Sydney typically use diplomas and associate degrees,235
NA,that might be offered at places like the UWSCollege at the University of Western Sydney to,235
NA,train themselves to get the skills that are necessary to then go on and earn an undergraduate,235
NA,degree. The Kemp-Norton report that I commissioned earlier this year and that was handed,235
NA,down a couple of months ago said that students who had done those kinds of pathway courses,235
NA,were much less likely to drop out in the first year of an undergraduate degree and that 24 per,235
NA,cent of students who had not done those courses dropped out in the first year of an,235
NA,undergraduate degree.,235
NA,When I sat down to think about reform of higher education I decided that I wanted to,235
NA,establish an equitable higher education system that gave those people who were less likely to,235
NA,go to university a greater chance to go to university. When I was at school I assumed that I,235
NA,"would go to university, and I did go to university because I went to an academic school and I",235
NA,had every single advantage that a young person could have. So when I sat down I did not,235
NA,decide to have a higher education system that advantaged people like me; I decided that I,235
NA,wanted a higher education system that advantaged people from low-SES backgrounds. That is,235
NA,why we are expanding the Commonwealth Grant Scheme to non-university higher education,235
NA,providers. That will help TAFEs educate more young people to get the same opportunities,235
NA,"that I have had in life, to get the start that they need. That is the answer to the member for",235
NA,Perth's questions.,235
NA,Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (16:28): Knowing that the minister has had a bit of trouble,235
NA,with some of the detail around the higher education policy-he is not quite clear on who it,235
NA,will affect and when it will affect them-I thought it would be worthwhile going through the,235
NA,cuts that are included in the higher education budget before asking the minister some,235
NA,questions on one particular one. We have seen in this budget some $5.8 billion in cuts to,235
NA,"higher education and university research: $3.2 billion in cuts, by taking the scalpel to HECS,",235
NA,Australia's highly successful and internationally renowned income contingent contribution,235
NA,system; $1.9 billion in cuts to universities by reductions in government core subsidies; $202,235
NA,"million in cuts by indexing university grants to CPI; $172 million in cuts to fund, promote and",235
NA,NA,235
NA,reward universities for enrolling low-SES students; $173 million in cuts for the training of,236
NA,"Australia's research students, the scientists and academics of tomorrow; a $75 million cut to",236
NA,the Australian Research Council; and a $31 million cut to the national regulator.,236
NA,The question I have is particularly about the consequences of these cuts. I want to focus on,236
NA,the $3.2 billion cut from HECS.,236
NA,It is clear the government does not know the consequences of this most radical,236
NA,"transformation to our higher education system in Australia for 30 years, and we heard that in",236
NA,the minister's non-answer to the member for Perth's question about science and engineering,236
NA,students. We know that the government is flying blind when it comes to the impact of its,236
NA,"higher education package on students and on their families. We know that the peak body,",236
NA,"Universities Australia, has asked the government to rethink the design of loan repayments and",236
NA,its cuts to the sector. We also know that Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief economist Saul,236
NA,"Eslake has warned of the consequences of higher interest rates on student loans, particularly",236
NA,for women. Mr Eslake said:,236
NA,"The prospect orfrepaying university loans whilst raising a family might deter women, while many other",236
NA,prospective students would weigh up the costs against the benefits of education.,236
NA,He stated:,236
NA,It would be irrational for people not to consider the cost in relation to their working life in the same way,236
NA,as when you borrow to buy a house.,236
NA,The changes to HECS will have a compounding effect on students paying extra in fees plus,236
NA,extra in HECS repayments and will start them off on their working lives with a huge debt,236
NA,"burden hanging over their heads, a debt burden which I have absolutely no doubt will deter",236
NA,many people from taking up the opportunity of higher education.,236
NA,Universities Australia has modelled the potential costs of engineering and nursing degrees.,236
NA,"They found that at the medium-fee increase scenario with a four per cent interest rate, an",236
NA,"engineering graduate working full-time faces a HELP debt of between $98,952 and $113,169",236
NA,"and would repay it over a period of 20 to 25 years. This is compared with $46,000 to $49,000",236
NA,debt and 14 to 18 years repayment under the existing arrangements.,236
NA,We know when we look at a nursing graduate that the estimates are equally frightening.,236
NA,The changes to HECS will force university graduates to pay more and to pay sooner. The,236
NA,"threshold will be lowered, forcing graduates to pay sooner but will be coupled with increases",236
NA,on HECS bills from higher degrees and increased interest rates. Modelling done on the,236
NA,changes has been published in the Financial Review showing repayment amounts and times,236
NA,"will soar, with a typical female taking up to 25 years to repay an engineering degree.",236
NA,My question to the minister is: will the government provide data based on the Australian,236
NA,higher education system's modelling which they looked at before taking such a radical reform,236
NA,process? Will they provide the data on the effect of the latest fee hikes which were announced,236
NA,in the budget? What will the effect be on Australian students and students who will not,236
NA,become students as a result of these despicable measures?,236
NA,NA,236
NA,"carefully to the member for Adelaide's latest contribution. I must say, I find it hard to believe",236
NA,that she can reconcile a statement that we are cutting higher education with the facts that are,236
NA,"found in the budget papers that clearly indicate that far from cutting higher education, we are",236
NA,NA,236
NA,increasing spending on higher education by $900 million over the forward estimates. And,237
NA,then I realised that it is possible that the member for Adelaide thinks that an incoming,237
NA,government simply spends on top of what the previous government did. It is possible that the,237
NA,member for Adelaide thinks-and she gave a litany of particular programs-that the new,237
NA,government keeps all the previous government's programs and then just adds its own on top,237
NA,"of that, which would obviously be pretty costly.",237
NA,"In 2007, I think she will find that when Labor last, unhappily, won office for six years, they",237
NA,did not just leave the previous Howard government's policies in place and then just add their,237
NA,own on top. They removed many of the Howard government programs. The one in education,237
NA,that leaps to mind was the vouchers for literacy and numeracy. That was an extremely,237
NA,successful program for young people learning how to read and how to count.,237
NA,"Putting that to one side, it can only be reconcilable with her complete lack of understanding",237
NA,of how government works in Australia. I will not get personal because the member for,237
NA,"Adelaide has tried to avoid being personal, but I would point out that she probably needs a bit",237
NA,of a refresher course in how government works. She also said that we were cutting the HECS,237
NA,"scheme. I remind her that it is now called the HELP scheme. Putting that to one side, the",237
NA,Higher Education Loan Program is not a program that can be cut because it is a loan program.,237
NA,"Whoever turns up to ask for a loan from the taxpayer to go to university, and is given an",237
NA,"undergraduate course, is able to access the loan program. That is why, while the current",237
NA,"HELP debt for the Commonwealth is about $30.1 billion, it will rise to $51 billion or $52",237
NA,billion over the coming years. It is not a program that can be cut; it is a program that can be,237
NA,"paid back at a fairer interest rate-for example, at the 10-year government bond rate rather",237
NA,"than CPI, which is an indexation rather than an interest rate. It is not a program that can be",237
NA,"cut, so whichever staff member gave the member for Adelaide that advice before she came",237
NA,into the chamber to contribute should probably be dealt with by her.,237
NA,The member for Adelaide also talked about modelling. There is a lot of speculation around,237
NA,the fee rises or fee falls after deregulation of the higher education system. There is a lot of,237
NA,speculation; much of it is based on hysteria and scaremongering. I refer the member for,237
NA,"Adelaide to the excellent statement by Fred Hilmer, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of",237
NA,New South Wales. He says:,237
NA,"It is up to universities, not Canberra, to decide what fees should apply to which courses.",237
NA,He said about the very modelling the member for Adelaide cited:,237
NA,The modelling released today by Universities Australia on the impact on fees of changes to cluster,237
NA,funding rates is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the way the system works …,237
NA,"The University of New South Wales is a member of Universities Australia, so it must have",237
NA,taken Professor Hilmer quite a lot of courage to publicly point out the massive failure in the,237
NA,Universities Australia modelling.,237
NA,"I refer the member for Adelaide to some excellent modelling that has been done, and which",237
NA,"was in The Australian higher education supplement, which is at the back of the paper. In case",237
NA,"the member for Adelaide does not know where it is in The Australian newspaper, it is after",237
NA,the business section. She will find it in that part of the newspaper. Andrew Trounson has,237
NA,"written an excellent piece, in which he has suggested that fee rises could be as low as $2,163 a",237
NA,"year in those courses where fees do rise. So, before the member for Adelaide quotes the",237
NA,NA,237
NA,"speculative modelling or returns to the National Tertiary Education Union's modelling, she",238
NA,might like to go and have a look at the higher education supplement of The Australian. She,238
NA,"will find there, that very good piece by Andrew Trounson.",238
Dr HENDY ,"Eden-Monaro) (16:37): As the minister knows, my electorate of Eden-",238
NA,Monaro is a rural electorate in the south-east corner of New South Wales. In our electorate we,238
NA,"have some 10,553 primary school students and we have some 911,000 secondary school",238
NA,students. We have heard from Labor that there have been cuts to expenditure on schools in,238
NA,"New South Wales and across the country, but my understand is that we are actually boosting",238
NA,"expenditure on schools. I would be interested to know, over the course of the next four years",238
NA,"of the forward estimates, how much school expenditure will be increasing in New South",238
NA,Wales. I would also like a general assessment of the spending on independent schools and,238
NA,"Catholic schools if the minister has that data to hand. My understanding is that, as opposed to",238
NA,"what the Labor opposition have been saying, there has been an increase in spending on",238
NA,schools in New South Wales for both state and private schools.,238
NA,"I know that you well know, Minister, that I was formerly the chief executive of the",238
NA,"Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. As such, I am particularly interested in skills",238
NA,and training issues. I note that ACCI put out a 2013 pre-election survey in which they,238
NA,canvassed the opinion of employers on the state of the vocational education and training,238
NA,"market. ACCI found that, even though the unemployment rate was relatively higher in recent",238
NA,"years, more than in four in five, or 82 per cent of, businesses remain concerned with",238
NA,"recruiting employees with appropriate skills, while 68.9 per cent of businesses were",238
NA,"concerned with recruiting employees with a good level of literacy and numeracy. Further,",238
NA,ACCI found that businesses rated employee productivity performance as their second highest,238
NA,"concern, and they noted:",238
NA,This finding is closely related to the Cost of Training Employees which is rated as the third highest,238
NA,concern.,238
NA,That was a survey done in May 2013. That is a legacy that the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd,238
NA,government left this government to fix.,238
NA,I am interested to know the nature of the integrated policy framework that we are putting in,238
NA,"place with regard to vocational education and training to deal with these problems. I note, for",238
NA,"example, that we are introducing what I regard as an excellent program of trade support loans",238
NA,"of $20,000 for apprentices. I would like to understand more fully from you, Minister, how",238
NA,that deals with the sort of legacy that we have had to fix in this budget for 2014.,238
NA,NA,238
NA,"member for Eden-Monaro for his contribution. I might start with his last question first, if he",238
NA,"does not mind. Yes, we did inherit a very poor legacy from the previous government around",238
NA,the outcomes for students at school level then going on to have difficulty in vocational,238
NA,"education and training-a very difficult legacy. In fact, the OECD PISA study released last",238
NA,year in December showed again that Australia has fallen not just in relative terms against the,238
NA,other nations in the OECD in literacy and numeracy but in real terms. This is a very,238
NA,fundamental problem. I do not blame any particular state Labor or Liberal government for,238
NA,"that. This has been a decline over 10 years, but it happened at the same time as a massive",238
NA,increase in spending. There was a 42 per cent increase in spending in schools over 10 years;,238
NA,"over the same 10 years, there was a significant decline in the outcomes for our students.",238
NA,NA,238
NA,"When we came to power, having seen that legacy, we set about doing a few very important",239
NA,things. We decided to focus on the things that really mattered-not just more money in,239
NA,"schools, which Labor is obsessed with, but the fundamental root problems in schools in the",239
NA,"outcomes for students. We identified those as being, firstly, an improvement in teacher",239
NA,"quality. The OECD said that, in eight out of 10 reasons why a student does well or badly in",239
NA,"Australia, the classroom to which they were allocated had the biggest impact. One out of 10",239
NA,reasons was low SES and one out of 10 reasons was every other factor. So we wanted to,239
NA,"address teacher quality, and what we can do at the federal level, of course, is address the",239
NA,training of teachers in universities. That is why we have established the Teacher Education,239
NA,"Ministerial Advisory Group, to advise me about how to improve teacher training at university",239
NA,and do an international benchmarking study.,239
NA,Ms MACTiernan interjecting-,239
NA,NA,239
NA,"schooling, more autonomy at the local level has a real impact on the expectations of students",239
NA,about what they might go on to do. I have seen the member for Perth support many of the,239
NA,government's measures around direct instruction or around independent public schools and I,239
NA,"am sure she would want to support that, but, rather than be distracted, we have put $70",239
NA,"million aside to expand independent public schooling in Australia. I must say, we are close to",239
NA,"securing all jurisdictions being able to take part in that particular program, because we want",239
NA,more autonomy at the local level.,239
NA,"We identified, as you did in your address, that the curriculum is an issue in schools. Rather",239
NA,"than accept mediocrity or failure, we decided that we would have a deep look at the national",239
NA,curriculum by appointing two very eminent people to conduct a study of the curriculum and,239
NA,its robustness. We wanted to determine whether it is useful for students and whether it,239
NA,"produces the kinds of outcomes that employers need in gaining skills and knowledge, because",239
NA,being at school is not just about gaining skills; it is about gaining both skills and knowledge.,239
NA,And we want to improve the parental engagement in students' education. In Western,239
NA,"Australia we have found that the more autonomy there is in a public school, the more engaged",239
NA,"parents are with their children's education. Therefore, the Independent Public Schools",239
NA,Initiative really dovetails into our initiatives around parental engagement. The budget has $1,239
NA,"million a year for ARACY, to assist us with good research and good methods to achieve",239
NA,better outcomes for students.,239
NA,The member for Eden-Monaro also asked about the misconception that we have cut,239
NA,funding for schools. We have massively increased funding for schools-an 8.7 per cent,239
NA,"increase this financial year; 8.9 per cent the following year, 8.9 per cent the following, and 6.6",239
NA,per cent in 2017-18. We have increased funding. This stands in stark contrast to Labor in the,239
NA,"Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which cut $1.2 billion from schools, which would",239
NA,"have left Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory short-Queensland by",239
NA,"$794 million, WA by $120 million, and the Northern Territory by $272 million. We have put",239
NA,"that back into the system. In the member's state of New South Wales, spending will increase",239
NA,"by 6.7 per cent, 7.8 per cent, 9.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent over the next four years. So New",239
NA,South Wales will be another big winner from the government deliberately living within our,239
NA,"means, but being fiscally wise and full of rectitude.",239
NA,NA,239
Ms HALL ,Shortland-Opposition Whip) (16:46): One of the less-known budget,240
NA,"measures that have slipped through without much public attention is cuts, in the education",240
NA,"portfolio, to published career resources. I am particularly concerned about the cut to the Job",240
NA,"Guide and the fact that it is no longer being printed or on the website, and about myfuture.",240
NA,"The Job Guide will be funded up to the 2015 edition, and myfuture will be funded up to",240
NA,December 2014. These job guides are invaluable resources for career and vocational,240
NA,"counsellors, both in schools and in TAFE colleges. Back in the Howard government days, Dr",240
NA,"Brendan Nelson, as Minister for Education, Science and Training, helped to bring in some",240
NA,really good policy reforms in the career development area.,240
NA,Whilst on one hand this government say they are about creating jobs and opportunities for,240
NA,"young people, they are taking away the tools that will assist in doing that. My question,",240
NA,"Minister, is: what is the rationale for this? What are you putting in place to replace these",240
NA,"really valuable resources, which I have used in a previous life? And how do you expect to",240
NA,help young people to find work and to undertake appropriate courses of study without having,240
NA,resources available for those people and for counsellors to provide counselling and advice on,240
NA,careers and education?,240
NA,NA,240
NA,"member for Shortland for her question. I am sure it is a well meant one, because the member",240
NA,"for Shortland is a conscientious local member of parliament. The myfuture and Job Guide,",240
NA,"which the member refers to, were left unfunded by the previous government beyond the 2014-",240
NA,15 financial year.,240
NA,Ms Hall: They could have been refunded.,240
NA,NA,240
NA,the government's decision was that myfuture and Job Guide would not be continued to be,240
NA,"funded after 2014-15. We did that, firstly, because we are in a budget emergency which",240
NA,requires us to make difficult decisions about what should and should not continue to be,240
NA,"funded. Secondly, we did that because, with respect to those two particular measures that",240
NA,"some students use to decide their careers and their futures, there is a plethora of information",240
NA,"now available for young people, particularly provided by the private sector. Therefore the",240
NA,question has to be whether the government should be spending taxpayers' money on myfuture,240
NA,and the Job Guide when the private sector has been filling that space extremely successfully,240
NA,"for the last 10 years. For example, there is information about careers on state and territory",240
NA,"websites-Victoria and Western Australia have their own dedicated career websites, two state",240
NA,government portals for advising young people about their careers. But other examples in the,240
NA,"private sector include Seek, CareerLounge, My Career, Career Hunter, Student Edge,",240
NA,SkillsOne and Hobsons Course Finder. So there are many different places that students can,240
NA,"get the advice that they need about future careers. Of course, young people these days use",240
NA,"social networking, social media, to find out a great deal about the careers that they might wish",240
NA,to pursue. So I am confident that myfuture and Job Guide will be quite correctly replaced by,240
NA,"the private sector filling that space, as they have already been doing in the last 10 years, and I",240
NA,"think that where the private sector is doing a job equally or better than the government, it is",240
NA,the wrong use of taxpayers' funds to replicate what the private sector can do as well if not,240
NA,better.,240
NA,NA,240
Ms SCOTT ,Lindsay) (16:51): My electorate of Lindsay is in the outskirts of Sydney.,241
NA,Being in the outskirts of Sydney one of the biggest challenges we have is that two-thirds of,241
NA,our working population have to commute every single day for jobs-one-third all the way,241
NA,into the city and one-third into greater Western Sydney. The Abbott government is already,241
NA,contributing a lot of resources and a lot of funding to assist the north-west and the south-west,241
NA,growth sector-$3.5 billion in fact to actually build some major construction work that will,241
NA,be in the south-west of Sydney.,241
NA,"I also have within the electorate of Lindsay one of the colleges of TAFE New South Wales,",241
NA,"Western Sydney Institute. The Western Sydney Institute of TAFE has some 94,000 students",241
NA,in it that they provide every year qualifications to within Australian frameworks. They all also,241
NA,offer open training and distance learning opportunities for people there as well. So as Western,241
NA,"Sydney grows there is a growing demand on workplace jobs, actual jobs, that are going to",241
NA,provide solutions for people to be ready to go-vocational jobs. But the Western Sydney,241
NA,Institute of TAFE is also really wonderful in the way it works with the University of Western,241
NA,Sydney providing its crucial gateway courses. So people who have not necessarily got the,241
NA,"best UAI can gateway from TAFE into university, which I think is a really fabulous initiative",241
NA,that these two training organisations do together-to provide vocational outcomes for people,241
NA,"right across Western Sydney. When we look at all this together, my question to the minister",241
NA,is: why is the government extending Commonwealth subsidies to private universities and the,241
NA,non-university higher education institutions?,241
NA,NA,241
NA,for Lindsay has identified a very excellent part of the higher education reforms that we are,241
NA,"proposing, and that is to give more young people from areas like Western Sydney the",241
NA,opportunity to use different pathways into higher education. The Commonwealth Grant,241
NA,Scheme has been applied to the 39 universities for many decades. The government's decision,241
NA,"has been that we want to expand that to the non-university higher education providers, many",241
NA,of which are very high quality and are offering as good if not better courses and career,241
NA,opportunities for young people. When we come to decide the amount that should be funded to,241
NA,"those different institutions that are non-university, the percentage that we pay them might well",241
NA,be lower than what universities are paid. That is why we have a working group advising us on,241
NA,"what, for example, that percentage should be, because universities do research. Being a",241
NA,"university, one of the definitions is that they do research as well as teaching, whereas a lot of",241
NA,"the non-university higher education providers, like TAFEs, do not do research but do teaching",241
NA,and do it very well.,241
NA,"The ones in Western Sydney, like the TAFE that the member for Lindsay talked about, will",241
NA,be big winners in the government's higher education reforms. They will be big winners,241
NA,because some of their courses will be funded under the new demand-driven system for,241
NA,"diplomas and sub-bachelor courses, so there will be an injection of funds to TAFEs through",241
NA,"that method. They will also be winners because, for the first time, they will be able to access",241
NA,"the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, and that will give them an opportunity to get an injection",241
NA,of funds that way. Around Australia-certainly in my state of South Australia-state,241
NA,governments have been cutting TAFE funding. So they have very much welcomed the,241
NA,decision by the government to expand that.,241
NA,NA,241
NA,I was very pleased to see in The Australian Financial Review on Monday an article by Tim,242
NA,"Dodd about this very subject that the member for Lindsay raises, headed 'SA Labor backs",242
NA,coalition on higher education funding'. The article reads:,242
NA,SA Higher Education Minister Gail Gago said on Saturday the federal government's plan to recognise,242
NA,and fund sub-bachelor degrees delivered by the SA TAFE system was welcome.,242
NA,"Of course, the same thing would apply to the TAFEs in Greater Western Sydney. The article",242
NA,goes on:,242
NA,"""The extension of funding of sub-bachelor program's to TAFE SA and other registered higher education",242
NA,providers provides an opportunity for TAFE SA to access Commonwealth funding for its diploma and,242
NA,"advanced diploma courses on an equal footing with universities,"" she said.",242
NA,"""TAFE SA already works closely with a number of universities in terms of providing opportunities for",242
NA,students to transfer to university and have recognition for their studies in TAFE SA and the recognition,242
NA,"and funding of these sub-bachelor programs delivered by TAFE SA is welcome.""",242
NA,"This is not a Liberal minister. This is a minister in a Labor state government, in the state from",242
NA,"which the member for Adelaide, the shadow minister, comes. I do not think they are from the",242
NA,"same faction, though. I think Gail Gago is in the left and the member for Adelaide is in the",242
NA,"right. I am not sure. They do not tend to talk closely in South Australia, but I am sure the",242
NA,"member for Adelaide can inform us. In any event, this is a minister in a state Labor",242
NA,government who is supporting the federal government's proposals. Why is she doing that?,242
NA,"Because they are good proposals. They are very good, and Gail Gago has worked out that",242
NA,what the government is doing is expanding opportunity to a great deal more students around,242
NA,Australia to get a higher education qualification. This will mean that students in Greater,242
NA,"Western Sydney will have the chance to go to university, get a degree or a diploma or do a",242
NA,"course, and then go on to earn 75 per cent more, $1 million more, over their lifetime than",242
NA,people without a higher education qualification.,242
NA,"In the time available to me, I will not try and start a new subject, but I might get a chance",242
NA,"to comment on it in a minute. There are many, many Australians who are pleased to support",242
NA,"students at university by subsidising their education. At the moment, they subsidise it 60 per",242
NA,"cent. As only 40 per cent of Australians have a university degree, that means that a great",242
NA,majority of the population are subsidising students to get the chance to earn 75 per cent more,242
NA,than them over a lifetime. It is a generous act on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. Rather,242
NA,"than whingeing about it, the member for Adelaide should be thanking the taxpayers of",242
NA,Australia for the subsidies that they provide to students around the country.,242
NA,"Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (16:58): Can I just point out that we were, 15 minutes ago,",242
NA,"due to commence questioning on the schools budget. On this side, we have a range of",242
NA,"important questions about school funding, school cuts, youth programs, chaplains and the",242
NA,curriculum review. I know that this government have a shameful record on education. I know,242
NA,"that they do not want accountability about this appalling record when it comes to education,",242
NA,but perhaps they could stop wasting time with these ridiculous dorothy dixers taking up every,242
NA,moment that is available.,242
NA,Government members interjecting-,242
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ," Mr Ewen Jones): Order, members on my right!",242
NA,NA,242
NA,Ms KATE ELLIS: I will be asking the minister questions. We know that the budget,243
NA,outlines $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals. Its estimates also reveal that $30 billion,243
NA,of these cuts will come from schools. We saw that in this exchange between Senator Wong,243
NA,"and Mr Ray, deputy secretary of Treasury, in an estimates hearing:",243
NA,"Senator WONG: Can you confirm that, with that figure, broadly you are looking at around 30 for",243
NA,schools and 50 for hospitals?,243
Mr Ray, It is a little bit under 30 for schools and a bit over 50 for hospitals.,243
NA,"So it is $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals, confirmed by this government's own",243
NA,Treasury department.,243
NA,"Now, with school cuts, this means that the game is up for this government. The public",243
NA,"service has confirmed the biggest-ever cuts to schools that we have seen in this nation, and we",243
NA,"know that there will be devastating consequences: less disability support, subject choices",243
NA,"drastically limited, school support officers and teachers' assistants cuts, sport and music",243
NA,"programs cut, remedial support cut and class sizes increased. But the government has made",243
NA,these cuts without any understanding of the impacts. We know that Senate estimates revealed,243
NA,"that despite starting work on its $80 billion cuts to schools and hospitals before Easter, the",243
NA,government still has no idea of the impact on the classroom and had not done the work to look,243
NA,at the potential impact.,243
NA,The education department could not say how many schools would close or how many,243
NA,teachers would be sacked or give any indication of the impact on students. It is absolutely,243
NA,frightening that the government would make the largest-ever cuts to our schools with no idea,243
NA,of the consequences.,243
NA,"Before the election, Tony Abbott promised that there would not be cuts to education but",243
NA,now it is clear that he simply does not care what damage these cuts will do. The government,243
NA,"have walked away from the commitments that they have made time and time again, including",243
NA,the so-called 'unity ticket' before the election-and didn't they pull one over the Australian,243
NA,public with that!,243
NA,What we do know is that the Liberal state governments have said that they do care about,243
NA,"these huge cuts from the Abbott government. We have seen New South Wales, Victoria, ACT",243
NA,and SA all commit to meeting their responsibilities under the six-year Gonski agreements-,243
NA,something that this government has failed to do. We have seen New South Wales Liberal,243
NA,Premier Mike Baird say that education cuts were 'a kick in the guts'. He said:,243
NA,… what services would they like us to cut …. you cannot outsource your problems to the states …,243
NA,"Similarly, we have seen the New South Wales education minister, Adrian Piccoli, speak out",243
NA,"against these cuts to education. We have seen the Victorian Treasurer, Michael O'Brien, say:",243
NA,When we handed down the Victorian budget last Tuesday we put extra money into Victorian,243
NA,hospitals and extra money into Victorian schools. We didn't put that extra money in so that the federal,243
NA,government can take money out.,243
NA,"And we have seen the Queensland Treasurer, Tim Nicholls, say that the federal budget was an",243
NA,attack on Queensland's health and education services.,243
NA,We have also seen the New South Wales Nationals' conference just last weekend call for,243
NA,the government to fund the full six years of the Gonski review. And we have seen these,243
NA,"attacks to the indexation of schools, which the now minister himself said, in opposition, were",243
NA,NA,243
NA,a 'frightening prospect'-to have indexation of three per cent. He is now happy to see,244
NA,indexation of just 2.5 per cent moving forward.,244
NA,So my questions in relation to these huge funding cuts are: how many Liberal and National,244
NA,backbenchers have raised concerns about the breaking of the Gonski agreements and the $30,244
NA,billion cuts to schools? How can the government justify making $30 billion in cuts to schools,244
NA,without any assessment of the impact they will have? Can the minister guarantee that no,244
NA,school will close as a result of these cuts? Or can the minister outline exactly how much,244
NA,worse off each school will be because of these cuts? On what evidence about the cost of,244
NA,delivering high-quality school education did the minister base the government's school-,244
NA,"funding model from 2018, which will index funding at just 2.5 per cent? And can the minister",244
NA,justify a school-funding model that cuts funds to schools in real terms and which schools have,244
NA,"warned will lead to reduced programs and quality, and higher fees?",244
NA,NA,244
NA,know where one begins with the member for Adelaide asking me dorothy dixer questions and,244
NA,"then accusing the government of doing the same thing, because the consideration-in-detail",244
NA,process is supposed to be an opportunity to elicit detail out of the budget-out of the,244
NA,appropriations. The member for Adelaide has chosen to give set piece speeches in each of her,244
NA,"contributions, with all the rhetoric that she could really save for Q&A or 7:30 or even in",244
NA,"parliament speaking on the bills, rather than wasting the time of the Federation Chamber in",244
NA,consideration in detail by giving rhetorical speeches and not actually asking questions.,244
NA,So if she has run out of time and not managed her time well it is because she has wasted,244
NA,the time of consideration-in-detail process by giving pointless and asinine speeches about the,244
NA,government's policies rather than actually asking questions. I suppose it is because she does,244
NA,"not have as much experience in the opposition as she should have. But, nevertheless, I will",244
NA,attempt to help her with the misunderstanding that she has about how the school funding,244
NA,agreements work.,244
NA,School funding agreements go for four years with the states and territories and the non-,244
NA,government sector-whether that is the Catholics or the independents. The forward estimates,244
NA,go for four years as well. So there is a coincidence: there is a four-year funding agreement;,244
NA,"there are four years of forward estimates. Over the forward estimates, spending on schools",244
NA,increases very substantially. As I said in response to the member for Eden-Monaro's,244
NA,"questions, spending in all schools, including recurrent and capital spending, over the next four",244
NA,"years is: an 8.7 per cent increase in 2014-15; 8.9 per cent in 2015-16; 8.9 per cent, again, in",244
NA,2016-17; and 6.6 per cent in 2017-18. So there are no cuts to school education in the federal,244
NA,"government's budget. In fact, the opposite is true. We are increasing spending and we have",244
NA,our own programs such as: programs like the independent public schools initiative costing,244
NA,$70 million; programs like the response to whatever the curriculum review hands down;,244
NA,"programs like $1 million a year to help us with parental engagement; and when the TEMAG,",244
NA,"the Teacher Education Ministerial Adviser Group, hands down its report to me, funds have",244
NA,been set aside to be able to respond to that. So we are increasing spending.,244
NA,The Labor Party's rhetoric is not matched by the reality of how they behaved in,244
NA,"government. In the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the previous minister, the now",244
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, ripped $1.2 billion out of schools. So, ironically, while the shadow",244
NA,"minister pretends that they were funding a new school funding model, in fact in Western",244
NA,NA,244
NA,"Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory they were defunding the school funding",245
NA,model. It took me as the Minister for Education not only to deliver a national agreement on,245
NA,"the national school funding model over four years, bringing the Northern Territory,",245
NA,"Queensland and Western Australia into the model, but also to find the $1.2 billion so that the",245
NA,model would work. And I did so.,245
NA,"Beyond the next four years, the member for Adelaide likes to raise fantastic figures. I will",245
NA,tell her that in 2017 we will sit down with all the jurisdictions and renegotiate a new school,245
NA,funding agreement. That will lead to more money in 2018 and more money in 2019 because,245
NA,obviously spending will increase on schools in line with the CPI and enrolments. But I am not,245
NA,"sure that the Labor Party can continue to pretend that the rivers of gold, the fantastic amounts",245
NA,"of money that they used to talk about in government, will ever materialise, in spite of what the",245
NA,Leader of the Opposition said on 31 March in Perth in answer to a question from a journalist:,245
NA,JOURNALIST: You have committed and you still will commit to the next election for those years five,245
NA,and six?,245
NA,SHORTEN: Yes.,245
NA,JOURNALIST: That will cost I think about $7 billion additional is that what you're prepared for that?,245
NA,"SHORTEN: We budgeted for this when we were in Government and furthermore, what does it cost",245
NA,Australia if we short change our kids?,245
NA,"He likes that kind of rhetoric. Unfortunately, this was not followed up. On 22 May at Moonee",245
NA,"Ponds he was asked: 'If you're bent on restoring this funding, what's the solution for finding",245
NA,"the savings to provide it, or would it be deficit funded?' Mr Shorten said:",245
NA,We'll reveal all our policies in good time before the next election.,245
NA,So he has stepped away from that commitment.,245
NA,"Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (17:08): My question is to the minister. Minister, I am very",245
NA,"fortunate to have an institution, namely the University of Queensland, in the electorate of",245
NA,Ryan. The university over the years has-,245
NA,Ms Kate Ellis interjecting-,245
NA,Mrs PRENTICE: We are on education. You wasted all that time. That is not my fault.,245
NA,Ms Kate Ellis interjecting-,245
NA,"Mrs PRENTICE: Stop interrupting, you are wasting time again. You are deliberately",245
NA,wasting time. You do not want answers. Let me ask my question.,245
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Mitchell): Order! The member for Adelaide has had her,245
NA,chance. The member for Ryan has the call and will be heard.,245
NA,"Ms Kate Ellis: Excuse me, we divided up the time so that the first 45 minutes was on",245
NA,higher education and the second was on schools.,245
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, The member for Adelaide will resume her seat. The member,245
NA,"for Ryan has the call, this is consideration in detail on education, and she will be able to ask",245
NA,her question-,245
NA,Ms Kate Ellis interjecting-,245
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, in silence!,245
NA,NA,245
NA,"Mrs PRENTICE: I was saying, Minister, that the university has produced many",246
NA,"outstanding graduates who are now leaders in their fields-in every aspect of business,",246
NA,governance and the different aspects of the lives that we lead. They are very impressive. The,246
NA,"University of Queensland, through its research, is now in the top 10 per cent of universities in",246
NA,"the world for the commercialisation of research projects. I would like you to elaborate, please,",246
NA,on that.,246
NA,NA,246
NA,Mrs PRENTICE: That interjection is just completely off the planet.,246
NA,Ms Kate Ellis interjecting-,246
NA,Mrs PRENTICE: I really object to the opposition deliberately wasting our time when we,246
NA,"have serious questions. Minister, how are the policies and measures that you have introduced",246
NA,helping the University of Queensland rate even higher across the world?,246
NA,NA,246
NA,that the member for Ryan finally got her chance to ask a question in spite of the interference,246
NA,being run by the member for Adelaide. The member for Adelaide knows that members of the,246
NA,government can ask any question they like during the 1½ hours of consideration in detail for,246
NA,"education. She is welcome to divide up the time for higher education, schools and child care.",246
NA,"She may well ask a question on child care, next, to the excellent assistant minister. But I",246
NA,would point out that she used most of that first hour asking about universities and then ran out,246
NA,of time for schools.,246
NA,I am not the time manager for the member for Adelaide-that is a matter for her-but she,246
NA,"does not get the chance, also, to tell the members of the government what they can ask",246
NA,"questions about. If she casts her mind back to 7 September last year, she might notice that",246
NA,Labor did not win the election. That is why members of her party are sitting on that side of the,246
NA,"House. So she gets to ask the questions that she wants to ask, and members of the government",246
NA,get to ask the questions that they want to ask. If she does not like the process she should not,246
NA,"take part in the process, because there are lots of members of the government who would like",246
NA,to ask questions and would like to hear the answers.,246
NA,"The member for Ryan asked about the University of Queensland, an excellent university in",246
NA,"both research and teaching. I can tell her that in the budget, research funding over four years,",246
NA,"including for ARC and AIATSIS, is $11 billion. So we are massively investing in research in",246
NA,this budget. I have spoken earlier in the consideration in detail about how we faced funding,246
NA,cliffs for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and the Future,246
NA,"Fellowships program. I found money for both of those programs, in spite of Labor only",246
NA,funding them for 12 months. Those were more of the landmines that Labor left for the,246
NA,"incoming government, because even they had worked out that the public had lost faith in them",246
NA,"as a government. They left two funding cliffs in NCRIS and the Future Fellowships, and I",246
NA,found the money and funded it.,246
NA,"So we are actually investing more money in research over the next four years, and",246
NA,"universities like the University of Queensland will benefit from that, because they have an",246
NA,excellent reputation in research. That is why I can tell the member for Ryan that Michael,246
NA,"Gallagher, the Executive Director of the Group of Eight, gave an excellent speech at the",246
NA,EduTECH Higher Education Leaders Congress in Brisbane on 4 June 2014. I recommend it to,246
NA,NA,246
NA,the member for Moreton because it was in his city. And I recommend it to the member for,247
NA,"Adelaide, who might not have had the opportunity to read it. Right at the end of that speech-",247
NA,"if she only wants to read one paragraph-on page 17 of 17, Michael Gallagher said:",247
NA,"The 2014 Higher Education Budget reforms are necessary. They are logical, coherent, sustainable,",247
NA,equitable and inevitable … My guess is that the detractors of micro-economic reform in Australia's,247
NA,higher education industry will find themselves on the wrong side of history in resisting efficiency,247
NA,"improvement and innovation, as they will be in opposing the redistributive measures of the package",247
NA,"and, curiously, supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged",247
NA,segments of the community.,247
NA,"Unfortunately, I can tell the member for Ryan, that is exactly where Labor has found",247
NA,themselves in this debate. They have found themselves on the wrong side of history. They,247
NA,have found themselves supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to,247
NA,more advantaged segments of the community. They have found themselves opposing the,247
NA,"redistributive measures of the package, like the expansion of the demand driven system to the",247
NA,"sub-bachelor courses, and the expansion of the Commonwealth Grant Scheme to non-",247
NA,university higher education providers and the Commonwealth scholarships fund. This is the,247
NA,"biggest Commonwealth scholarships fund in Australia's history and will give many, many",247
NA,"more students in both regional and rural Australia, as well as the cities, the chance to go to",247
NA,university.,247
NA,Research universities like UQ will benefit substantially from what their own Group of,247
NA,"Eight describes as a 'logical, coherent, sustainable, equitable and inevitable' package of higher",247
NA,education reform. It will allow them to put more effort and their own money into research and,247
NA,to determine the areas of research that they are best at and the courses that they offer that are,247
NA,"their highest quality courses and fund and support those, rather than simply have every",247
NA,"offering in order to be able to chase the revenue, which is how the previous government had",247
NA,established the university system. That is why these higher education reforms will make a,247
NA,substantial difference to young people from low socioeconomic status backgrounds in,247
NA,particular and allow universities like UQ to compete with their Asian counterparts.,247
NA,Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (17:15): Knowing how desperate the government are to,247
NA,"avoid accountability on schools and education questions, I am going to ask a range of",247
NA,questions on both schools and child care and ask that those which the government does not,247
NA,answer in this place be taken on notice.,247
NA,My first point is around the school chaplains program. I note that the budget allocated $245,247
NA,million for the National School Chaplaincy Program but that this minister decided to declare,247
NA,that this funding would only be available for religious chaplains and that welfare officers and,247
NA,other qualified counsellors would not receive funding under this program. We note that there,247
NA,"are many indications of the government's hypocrisy-firstly, that it talks about school",247
NA,autonomy on one hand and on the other hand says that it will not give principals the option of,247
NA,deciding that a welfare officer is best for them. How does the government justify cutting,247
NA,funding for qualified welfare staff that so many schools rely on? Has the government,247
NA,undertaken an impact assessment of this change? I also note that the minister was bragging,247
NA,about reducing compliance on these school chaplains. How will the government ensure that,247
NA,the program standards and safeguards will be maintained? Why didn't the government consult,247
NA,with school principals and parents before making this decision? How many schools will lose,247
NA,welfare officers as a result of this government's decision? If the government needs to take this,247
NA,NA,247
NA,"on notice, I understand, but can it provide a list of each school which previously had access to",248
NA,a non-religious welfare officer under this program?,248
NA,I also have a range of questions around the almost $1 billion in cuts to child care which this,248
NA,"government has announced, including the $157 million cuts to family day care. Why did the",248
NA,government refuse to consult with the family day care sector before deciding to axe this,248
NA,"essential support, which Family Day Care Australia estimates will make families have to pay",248
NA,an extra $35 a week in their family day care fees? What plans does the government have to,248
NA,make up for any loss of supply due to the cutting of these funds? Has the government,248
NA,undertaken any analysis on the areas of Australia that are most likely to be impacted by the,248
NA,changes? How will the government provide assurances that services have educators in areas,248
NA,where family day care is critically important?,248
NA,Regarding the appalling changes to and attacks against the means-tested childcare benefit,248
NA,"which this government is so proudly bragging will only impact people who earn $42,000 or",248
NA,"more, how can the government continue to push for a paid parental leave scheme that will",248
NA,"deliver $50,000 cheques to millionaires whilst cutting the existing childcare benefit that",248
NA,"people who earn just $42,000 a year rely upon? How will the government save $230.4 million",248
NA,from these measures if it is continuing to try and argue that black is white and this is not a,248
NA,savings measure and a cut? I ask the government to provide the House with a breakdown of,248
NA,"how this figure of 500,000 families that will be worse off as a result of this measure was",248
NA,calculated. If the government has done no such analysis on the impact on families of various,248
NA,"income levels, will it at least now do it and provide it to the House as this bill goes through?",248
NA,"Regarding preschool, I notice that the government are backing away from support for",248
NA,"universal access in our preschool system, citing that they do not want to undermine the",248
NA,"Productivity Commission report, yet they are very happy to undermine and pre-empt that",248
NA,report when it comes to slashing childcare benefit and childcare rebate for hundreds of,248
NA,thousands of Australian families. I ask: will the minister guarantee the continuation of federal,248
NA,funding for preschools? Will the minister make a commitment to an ongoing partnership with,248
NA,state and territory governments to fund preschool programs?,248
NA,I will also go to the Minister for Education when it comes to his attacks on all of the youth,248
NA,unemployment prevention programs which are so critically important in our schools at a time,248
NA,when the government is at the same time attacking Australians for being too reliant on,248
NA,welfare and threatening to leave young people with absolutely nothing to live on for six,248
NA,months. Why is it that every youth unemployment prevention program is being cancelled in,248
NA,his portfolio?,248
NA,I also note the Prime Minister's recent comments about industry involvement in schools. I,248
NA,ask the government: if trades in schools and linking with industry is so important to jobs and,248
NA,Australia's future productivity then why are trades training centres and partnership brokers,248
NA,"programs, which are providing an effective way of bringing industry in and of providing a",248
NA,"pathway to work experience and employment beyond school, all being cut by this government",248
NA,that promised no cuts to education and seems to delight in delivering record cuts in that same,248
NA,portfolio? (Time expired),248
NA,NA,248
NA,not take five minutes so that the Assistant Minister for Education will have the opportunity to,248
NA,respond on childcare issues. I am hoping the member for Adelaide will regard that as a,248
NA,NA,248
NA,helpful proposal because if she speaks again that means that the assistant minister will not get,249
NA,the opportunity to respond at all.,249
NA,The shadow minister asked about Youth Connections. Youth Connections was a program,249
NA,that had 74 per cent of its participants aged under 17. It is therefore the responsibility of the,249
NA,states and territories to provide that kind of assistance that Youth Connections provided. It,249
NA,"was duplicating effort. There are lots of great programs, Commonwealth programs, state",249
NA,programs and territory programs but it is not the Commonwealth's responsibility to provide,249
NA,them all. The states and territories have to take responsibility for the things that are their area,249
NA,of responsibility.,249
NA,Too often the great chasm between Labor and Liberal is shown up in just this kind of,249
NA,"example where, in Labor's world, the Commonwealth should pay for and do everything. If",249
NA,"they have to borrow the money from overseas, they have no problem with that. In the",249
NA,"conservative Liberal and Nationals parties' world, we need to live within our means and we",249
NA,need to pay back the debt. Areas that are properly the responsibility of the states and,249
NA,territories should be delivered by the states and territories. That goes for the school chaplaincy,249
NA,program as well.,249
NA,The school chaplaincy program was initiated by the Howard government. It was a,249
NA,chaplaincy program. When the Labor Party came to office there was quite a tussle between,249
NA,"Julia Gillard as the then Minister for Education and the Prime Minister at the time, Mr Rudd.",249
NA,Mr Rudd supported the chaplaincy program. Julia Gillard opposed the chaplaincy program.,249
NA,She wanted to kill the chaplaincy program. Kevin Rudd saved the chaplaincy program. The,249
NA,compromise between these two individuals was that it would be expanded to welfare officers,249
NA,and counsellors. Welfare officers and counsellors in schools are quite properly the domain of,249
NA,"state and territory governments. Now that we are in government, we have returned the",249
NA,"chaplaincy program to which original intention, which is a chaplaincy program.",249
NA,If states and territories want to continue to fund welfare officers and counsellors then they,249
NA,are perfectly at liberty to do so. I would welcome them doing so but that is a decision that,249
NA,they should make and not be infantilised by the Commonwealth making these decisions on,249
NA,their behalf. I will end on that note and allow the Assistant Minister for Education the,249
NA,opportunity to respond.,249
Ms LEY ,Farrer-Assistant Minister for Education) (17:23): I thank the member for,249
NA,"Adelaide, the shadow minister, for her questions. I am happy to address some of the key",249
NA,points she has raised. The answers to all of those questions she raised around childcare benefit,249
NA,and childcare rebate could be found in the speech I made to the House both on the,249
NA,introduction of the bill earlier last week and the summing up speech this afternoon. I am,249
NA,happy to go over them again in the order that they were asked. I will address first the family,249
NA,day care matter.,249
NA,It is interesting because the shadow minister was in fact the minister in 2012 when the,249
NA,"Australian National Audit Office did an audit of the Community Support Program, which",249
NA,assists family day care. This was a program that was only in existence after 2006 following,249
NA,"which it exceeded its budget allocation significantly year after year. In fact, it was spiralling",249
NA,out of control in excess expenditure. So the Audit Office highlighted problems and,249
NA,"recommended a review. The minister, now the shadow minister, sat on her hands and did",249
NA,nothing. It was a part of Labor's mess that we had to clean up on coming to government.,249
NA,NA,249
NA,The shadow minister asks about consultations with the secretary. I am happy to inform her,250
NA,"that yesterday I had a very wide-ranging, productive discussion following on from earlier",250
NA,"conversations, earlier discussions and earlier meetings between ourselves, the department and",250
NA,the sector. But I would like to let the shadow minister know that yesterday I had a particularly,250
NA,productive session with family day care stakeholders. The reality is that although this is a,250
NA,"budget measure this year, this is not coming in for 12 months. There are no changes for 12",250
NA,months and we will work together with the sector to support and to have strong family day,250
NA,"care. With no changes for 12 months, the transition is workable, manageable and well-",250
NA,supported by the sector.,250
NA,Remember that Labor did nothing to fix this problem. There were several problems that,250
NA,"Labor did nothing to fix, but the main problem that we dealt with in the House today was the",250
NA,bill that we put through the lower House that paused the thresholds for the childcare benefit,250
NA,"and the childcare rebate. Speaker after speaker, including the shadow minister in her question",250
NA,"just now, referred to these changes as 'cuts'. In fact, they are not cuts. It is disingenuous, it is",250
NA,misleading and it is scaremongering to the parents of Australia to describe something that,250
NA,"pauses a threshold, which is a level of income at which you qualify for a certain benefit, as a",250
NA,cut when it simply is not.,250
NA,People listening to the member for Adelaide would assume that the hourly rates of child,250
NA,care benefit that they are entitled to in the various circumstances they have their children in,250
NA,"are actually going to reduce. In fact, they are not. They are going to increase. That is because",250
NA,the quantum of that subsidy directly to the parents will continue to be indexed. The shadow,250
NA,minister knows that. In making political point after political point and rhetorical flourish after,250
NA,"rhetorical flourish, she is in fact simply stating untruths.",250
NA,The sheer hypocrisy of the stance that has been taken by Labor really is-and I know it is,250
NA,an overused word-breathtaking. That is because contained in the bill that went through the,250
NA,House today was the measure to pause the child care rebate. This was a measure that was,250
NA,introduced by Labor in its last budget. It was desperate to find savings. It knew that the sixth,250
NA,surplus that it predicted was not going to happen. There were six non-surpluses in a row. So it,250
NA,pulled savings out of midair-savings from everywhere. There were $106 million in savings,250
NA,"from pausing the child care rebate. They paused the child care rebate for six years, but they",250
NA,did not actually put the legislation through to effect that. We were left to do the dirty work,250
NA,and to pick up the pieces.,250
NA,"As I said in the House today, it gives me no pleasure to be bringing in the savings that we",250
NA,"know, as a responsible government, that we have to make. It gives me no pleasure at all, but I",250
NA,perfectly understand that the job has to be done. By putting in place Labor's own measure-,250
NA,"which it did not have the guts to legislate and then made excuses about-and another sensible,",250
NA,"moderate measure that simply lasts for three years until we get the budget back under control,",250
NA,we are participating in putting Australia back on a sustainable path. If anybody is interested in,250
NA,"the child care needs of the modern economy in which we all live and work, then they must",250
NA,"surely be interested in the health of that economy, in the productivity of that economy, in the",250
NA,"participation of women in the workforce, in the health of families and in the quality of child",250
NA,care for children. All of these things are front and centre.,250
NA,I acknowledge that all members of the House want those things. We completely disagree,250
NA,"on how we will get there. We absolutely take responsibility for the work that we are doing,",250
NA,NA,250
NA,the Productivity Commission inquiry that we are having and the new policy ideas that will,251
NA,"come in just a few months, which will look into bringing in legislation with new initiatives",251
NA,next year. There is an exciting future. I do hope that the shadow minister is not going to hold,251
NA,us back.,251
NA,An honourable member interjecting-,251
Dr HENDY ,"Eden-Monaro) (17:28): I do not have four minutes! In Eden-Monaro, which",251
NA,"is a rural seat, we have some 2,000-plus preschool students. That is 5.7 per cent of the",251
NA,"population, so it is larger than the national average. I understand that, through the course of",251
NA,"the last six years, childcare fees have increased by some 53.2 per cent overall. That is just a",251
NA,shocking figure. I want to ask the assistant minister what we are doing to rein in that sort of,251
NA,increase and what is the state of the Productivity Commission review?,251
Ms LEY ,Farrer-Assistant Minister for Education) (17:29): In the interests of time and,251
NA,"following on committees and considerations, can I say to the member for Eden-Monaro that I",251
NA,congratulate him on his representation of a diverse rural seat and acknowledge that the,251
NA,numbers of rural and regional members on our side of the parliament mean that we do,251
NA,understand the needs of rural and regional child care. It is going to be extremely important,251
NA,with our Productivity Commission review. I will specifically tasked the Productivity,251
NA,Commission to look at rural and regional models of child care that work.,251
NA,"Yes, it is a shocking legacy and really summed up, as the member for Eden-Monaro has, in",251
NA,one sentence: costs went up 53 per cent coupled with out-of-pocket expenses for families that,251
NA,went up 40 per cent. What a shameful legacy left by Labor. I am already working with my,251
NA,state and territory counterparts to reduce the regulation and red tape that surrounds child care,251
NA,"operators and surrounds family day care, and out-of-school care and adds to cost but does not",251
NA,"add to quality. We are focusing on the relationship between the educator and the child, the",251
NA,"early learning, the nurturing, the care but not all the book work. We believe that that will help",251
NA,relieve the upward pressure on costs. We look forward to your participation in the,251
NA,consultations that the Productivity Commission will have in the weeks and months ahead.,251
NA,Proposed expenditure agreed to.,251
NA,Environment Portfolio,251
NA,"Proposed expenditure, $1,723,004,000",251
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (17:31): Let me make this point to,251
NA,begin with: the meta-position for this budget is framed by six consecutive deficits which had,251
NA,accrued to a total of $240 billion of funds that were spent over and above that which the,251
NA,"Australian government received in revenue. Just to remind the House: $27 billion, $54 billion,",251
NA,"$47 billion, $43 billion, $18 billion and $49 billion. That is the massive national task against",251
NA,which this budget is framed. So each and every portfolio has had to work to find greater,251
NA,efficiencies. This portfolio has been part of that process.,251
NA,NA,251
Mr HUNT," However, I am absolutely delighted that all up in a very difficult and",251
NA,challenging budget environment so as future generations would not have to pay back the,251
NA,"consumption of this generation, we have been able to secure $3.5 billion of new expenditure",251
NA,programs. There is $2.55 billion for the Emissions Reduction Fund. This is a fund which will,251
NA,actually reduce emissions. It is about doing things where you pay on achievement. It is not,251
NA,NA,251
NA,about the $30 billion of funds which were paid out by the previous government without in,252
NA,most cases any test whatsoever. I will remind the member for Moreton that in fact there was,252
NA,"$9.2 billion being paid to zinc, aluminium, cement, general manufacturing firms with no",252
NA,"strings attached by their government. The second thing is, they were paying-",252
NA,NA,252
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ," Mr Hawke): Order, Member for Moreton!",252
Mr HUNT, The second thing is they were paying $5.5 billion to brown coal generators,252
NA,with no strings attached. I want to repeat that: they were paying $5 billion to one small sector,252
NA,with no strings attached. That is probably the largest transfer of funds in Australian history to,252
NA,one small sector of the economy within one short period of time. There was $1.3 billion of,252
NA,"subsidies to the coal sector when they said that they were clamping down on emissions, none",252
NA,"of which made sense. By contrast, the first of our major new expenditure items compares with",252
NA,a $30 billion set of transfer payments from the Commonwealth to firms under the previous,252
NA,"government. We spend $2.55 billion, we withdraw a $30 billion set of transfers from the",252
NA,"Commonwealth to the private sector, which in almost every case were being done with no",252
NA,strings attached whatsoever.,252
NA,The second of the significant areas of new expenditure is $525 million over four years for,252
NA,"the Green Army. This is a project aimed at achieving two simple things. Firstly, it is about",252
NA,ensuring that there is employment.,252
NA,An opposition member interjecting-,252
Mr HUNT," Actually your side is giving bipartisan support, dummkopf. It is about",252
NA,ensuring that there is bipartisan support-,252
NA,An honourable member interjecting-,252
Mr HUNT, I am pleased to hear that-for a program which provides employment and,252
NA,"does good local environmental things. That could be boardwalks, riverbank restoration,",252
NA,"riparian recovery, sand dune restoration or protection of threatened species, whether it is",252
NA,habitat restoration or breeding programs-practical things.,252
NA,The third of the areas in which there has been a significant contribution in this budget is a,252
NA,global figure of more than $500 million for two capital equipment programs-for the,252
NA,"acquisition of a supercomputer for the Bureau of Meteorology, which is about better advice",252
NA,"with regard to cyclones, floods and fires, and for the acquisition of a new icebreaker, which is",252
NA,critical national infrastructure not just for research but for upholding our position and,252
NA,"maintaining our bases in our Antarctica, without which we would place at risk our sovereign",252
NA,claim over the Australian Antarctic Territory. Both of those items were unfunded. They were,252
NA,not given funding by the previous government. Both were overdue. Both have been funded.,252
NA,"The final figure will be determined through a tender process, but I can safely say that,",252
NA,"between the two, we have provisioned over $500 million. All up, it has been a very effective",252
NA,"budget round, against a difficult national backdrop.",252
Mr BUTLER ,"Port Adelaide) (17:36): I thank the minister for his opening, particularly",252
NA,his reference to the Emissions Reduction Fund. The Prime Minister in the parliament earlier,252
NA,"this month, and during his trip to North America, in particular, sought to equate the Emissions",252
NA,Reduction Fund and the direct action policy of the new government to the Clean Power Plan,252
NA,announced recently by President Obama. Can the minister outline the similarities?,252
NA,NA,252
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (17:36): I would be delighted to.,253
NA,The first thing is that the American program sets out a simple proposition: it allows us to,253
NA,"reduce emissions without a carbon tax, without a cap-and-trade scheme, without an emissions",253
NA,"trading scheme. In fact, the last time that there was an attempt to introduce such a scheme in",253
NA,"the United States, when all three arms of the American system were aligned on a party",253
NA,"basis-a Democrat congress, a Democrat Senate and a Democrat presidency-one of the",253
NA,"leading Democrat candidates for the Senate, Joe Manchin, from West Virginia, took the cap-",253
NA,"and-trade bill, tied it to a tree and shot it. That was really the last time that we saw any action",253
NA,in the United States towards a cap-and-trade scheme.,253
NA,"By contrast, what we see now is that the White House plan, which we endorse and support",253
NA,"and value and appreciate, as a critical global contribution, takes a very different approach. It",253
NA,"does not, to the best of my knowledge and reading, mention cap-and-trade, an emissions",253
NA,"trading scheme or a carbon tax at any point in the documentation. I stand to be corrected, but",253
NA,"on my reading that is a very clear position. Beyond that, what does it seek to do? It seeks to",253
NA,encourage two primary things. It seeks to encourage energy efficiency and the cleaning-up of,253
NA,coal fired power stations. Compare that with the carbon tax that we currently have in,253
NA,Australia. What you see here is a transfer of $5½ billion from the taxpayer to the brown coal,253
NA,"generators, largely within Victoria.",253
NA,"However, in the United States the system is very clear: they are seeking to clean up the",253
NA,"power stations, to provide incentives to engage in gasification, drying, potentially carbon",253
NA,"capture and, most likely, reuse. They are also looking at cleaner transmission. They are also",253
NA,looking at general plant efficiency. All of these things are precisely the outcomes which we,253
NA,are considering under the Emissions Reduction Fund. It will depend upon proposals that are,253
NA,"the most cost-effective and the cheapest, but it is absolutely clear that the power sector is",253
NA,already looking at those sorts of options.,253
NA,The other thing I want to say about the United States is: we have long said that you cannot,253
NA,"have an effective functioning global agreement without an agreement between the US, China,",253
NA,India and the EU. So what we see in the United States is a fundamental step towards an,253
NA,agreement at the end of 2015 at the Paris UNFCCC conference. This is something to be,253
NA,welcome and embraced. But let us not kid ourselves that this is anything other than an,253
NA,alternative to a carbon tax. The White House papers could not be clearer that this is not a,253
NA,"carbon tax. They do not make any mention of a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade or an emissions",253
NA,trading scheme.,253
NA,The other point I want to make here is sometimes there is reference to China as if China,253
NA,had a broad based functioning carbon tax. Let me give three examples: the city of Shenzhen,253
NA,"gives away 100 per cent of its permits for free-in other words, there is no charge; the city of",253
NA,Shanghai gives away 100 per cent of its permits for free; and the city of Beijing gives away,253
NA,99.9 per cent of its permits for free. The difference between what we have here in Australia,253
NA,and what we see in China is the difference between a bowling ball and a pea.,253
Mr COLEMAN ,Banks) (17:41): I am pleased to have the opportunity to ask a question,253
NA,of the minister this afternoon about the Bureau of Meteorology. I was pleased to hear him,253
NA,make reference to its important role in his opening remarks. The Bureau of Meteorology plays,253
NA,a critical role right across the nation. Australians of all walks of life rely on the bureau for,253
NA,"their day-to-day weather forecast. Importantly, it also plays a role in forecasting extreme and",253
NA,NA,253
NA,"unexpected weather events and, indeed, emergencies which we see in our nation whether they",254
NA,relate to flooding or extreme heat-which can lead to fire-or other extreme forms of,254
NA,weather. The bureau plays a critical role in ensuring that Australians are aware of those events,254
NA,in advance to the greatest extent possible.,254
NA,The bureau is particularly important in rural and regional areas where so much of the,254
NA,livelihood of rural and regional Australians is affected by the weather in farming and in the,254
NA,utilisation of our arable land. The bureau's advice of expected rainfall and temperature,254
NA,conditions is very important to the planning of those businesses.,254
NA,"It is also the case that, over the years, weather forecasting technology has improved from",254
NA,the early days where there was probably a very limited reliance on technology to now where,254
NA,in real time on the Bureau of Meteorology website you can observe the different forecasts as,254
NA,"they pertain to different postcodes right around the nation in different regions. Again, the",254
NA,atmospheric conditions are so critical.,254
NA,"As our population is increasingly concentrated around large metropolitan areas, there is",254
NA,obviously an increased impact from extreme weather events because more people are affected,254
NA,by those events as they occur. The bureau's good work in forecasting those events is well,254
NA,"known, which makes it one of the most highly respected institutions in the nation.",254
NA,"Against that background, I did want to ask about the government's efforts in computing",254
NA,technology. I understand that the government has made some moves recently to invest in,254
NA,"supercomputing technology, and I am very interested to understand the likely impact of",254
NA,technology on boosting Australia's forecasting capabilities and the benefits that will be,254
NA,derived from that technology more generally.,254
Mr HUNT ,"Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (17:44): To the member for Banks,",254
NA,let me start by acknowledging his fundamental role as one of the lead architects of the,254
NA,"Georges River recovery plan. Whilst he was a candidate, he worked hard to recognise that this",254
NA,was a fundamental local environmental issue. It is about the health of the river. It is about the,254
NA,"health of the fringing communities. In particular, the green army program was announced at a",254
NA,Georges River site. We committed to a significant Georges River recovery plan and I am very,254
NA,"hopeful that, in fact, the green army legislation will pass through the Senate, if it has not",254
NA,"already, in the coming hours. The consequence of that will be that this program will be ready",254
NA,to roll out and the Georges River will include some of the first projects in the country.,254
NA,"Having said that, the broader challenge raised by the member is of forecasting for",254
NA,"Australia's urban and regional communities. In Sydney itself, only some years ago there was a",254
NA,"massive and catastrophic hailstorm. In Toowoomba and the Toowoomba Range, we",254
NA,witnessed the most tragic of flood events only a few short years ago. The lesson from that is,254
NA,that early warning and early intervention are absolutely critical. So we as a government have,254
NA,provisioned to acquire a new supercomputer. This will be the eighth supercomputer in the,254
NA,series since they first began to be adopted. The hope is that there will be two key steps over,254
NA,"the coming two years. Next year, we are due to acquire new satellite capacity, and the",254
NA,"following year we are due to acquire a new supercomputer. It was a project that was, sadly,",254
NA,unfunded. It should have been funded. It was overdue to be funded and there was a black hole,254
NA,"in the budget. Nevertheless, we have made space in order to find that funding. We have",254
NA,"funded it fully. The funding is set aside to ensure that, once the tender process is complete, the",254
NA,supercomputer will be acquired.,254
NA,NA,254
NA,Why is it important? It is important for rural communities because it provides early,255
NA,"warning in relation to fire, flood and cyclone. In particular, the fire authorities currently use",255
NA,"the existing supercomputer to provide early warnings about wind shifts, which are absolutely",255
NA,fundamental to fighting the fire and even more fundamental to protecting the lives of people,255
NA,"in particular communities and firefighters. In the end, there will be fewer lives lost, we hope,",255
NA,as a consequence of this. What is the capacity upgrade? It is a tenfold increase in capacity.,255
NA,"That allows us to run more cycles, to look at more activities on a commensurate basis and to",255
NA,"give earlier warnings-in short, more data, more frequently, more accurately. That is what the",255
NA,"supercomputer is about. For our urban customers, for the population of Australia, they can see",255
NA,"if there is the risk of flash flooding, as we saw, tragically, in Toowoomba. If there is the risk",255
NA,"of a hail event, precautions can be taken such as placing cars undercover. We cannot stop all",255
NA,"of the effects of weather, but we can give people the opportunity to mitigate. That is a quick",255
NA,"summary. It is an important acquisition and, at the end of the day, it is about better data for",255
NA,Australians and about saving lives.,255
Mr BUTLER ,Port Adelaide) (17:48): I ask the minister a couple of questions about the,255
NA,"Emissions Reduction Fund. Firstly, can the minister point to any modelling, conducted either",255
NA,"internally by the department or under contract by an external organisation, around the likely",255
NA,abatement achieved through the Emissions Reduction Fund and its contribution to the five per,255
NA,"cent target? In particular, does that modelling distinguish between abatement that is or is not",255
NA,consistent with internationally agreed methodologies? Regarding the Carbon Farming,255
NA,Initiative legislation that the minister introduced to the parliament today as the vehicle for this,255
NA,"fund, obviously this essentially expands the land sector specific framework beyond the land",255
NA,sector to cover a whole range of other sectors that the minister would like to see covered by,255
NA,"the Emissions Reduction Fund, including household and community energy efficiency and a",255
NA,range of others.,255
NA,The economics of the potential abatement from these other sectors will obviously be,255
NA,"different potentially to the economics of the land sector, yet, as I understand it, the",255
NA,government's intention is to assess all of the sectors on the same lowest-cost model. I am just,255
NA,wondering whether the minister can outline how the government intends to deal with those,255
NA,"cost variations between those different sectors; and how an average weighted price disclosure,",255
NA,"which is intended to provide the price signal for potential bidders, will have any validity if the",255
NA,contracts are highly variable.,255
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (17:50): I am delighted to answer,255
NA,the questions from the member for Port Adelaide. It is good to see him on his feet. He has not,255
NA,"actually asked a question in 9½ months in question time, but I have not embarrassed him in",255
NA,public about that fact.,255
NA,Let me deal with part 2 of the question first in relation to the Carbon Farming Initiative,255
NA,extensions. The answer is very simple: we are using the lowest-cost purchasing model. That is,255
NA,"the way to purchase abatement, and we are shamelessly, clearly, openly, purchasing",255
NA,abatement on the lowest cost. That was what we said we would do on 2 February 2010 and,255
NA,we have never deviated from that model. We have continued that through to this particular,255
NA,"approach, and the answer is very simple: the clean energy regulator will produce a weighted",255
NA,average price for abatement and the way that purchasing will occur will be up the cost curve.,255
NA,"So, as volume needs to be purchased, each successive unit will be acquired and, then at such",255
NA,NA,255
NA,"time as the regulator has acquired all of the units which it needs to acquire, we will see a final",256
NA,price and that weighted average price is released. We are not differentiating by sectors and we,256
NA,have always said we would not do that.,256
NA,"As an example, if you have $100 to acquire units, you could acquire on a differentiated",256
NA,"basis two units at $50, because you wanted to support a particular sector but you would only",256
NA,"get two tonnes of abatement. Or you could acquire 20 units at $5 per tonne, if that were the",256
NA,"cheapest. We will without doubt, without question, be purchasing the lowest-cost abatement.",256
NA,That was always our intention and that is how you can get the maximum efficient result for,256
NA,Australia. I think that that is very important.,256
NA,"Secondly, it is important to put this in the context that the world has two primary",256
NA,"approaches. One is a carbon tax based system which is, for example, the European system-",256
NA,although they have high caps relative to actual production. They have more than 100 sectors,256
NA,"carved out as being trade exposed, and many have said that the net contribution to emissions",256
NA,"reduction is likely to be minimal, if not negligible, between now and 2020 such as the head of",256
NA,"Point Carbon's research desk-Point Carbon being, arguably, the leading trading house in",256
NA,relation to the European scheme.,256
NA,"The alternative scheme, the clean development mechanism, produces abatement as an",256
NA,"offset, which is then purchased on a lowest-cost basis. At the moment there are about 1.4",256
NA,million tonnes of genuine abatement credits which are available internationally. The evidence,256
NA,"is clear that the clean development mechanism, which is a model for what we are doing here,",256
NA,"has produced genuine, low-cost abatement.",256
NA,The second half of the question was in relation to the Emissions Reduction Fund. I will,256
NA,point the member to the work of Energetics. I will also point the member to the fact that the,256
NA,white paper sets out expectations. The modelling on which that was based is also set out in,256
NA,terms of the budget. The budget sets out a projected cash flow.,256
NA,The full $2.55 billion will be available from day one. We have changed. We have made a,256
NA,"policy change here: instead of the $2.55 billion being phased over four years, it has all been",256
NA,"brought forward and is all available from day one. A projected cash flow has been set out,",256
NA,"which is based on, obviously, the analysis of the department. What we cannot do of course is",256
NA,"release the projected price, because that is commercial-in-confidence and would prejudice a",256
NA,Commonwealth tender. That work has been done. It has been done not just by us in terms of,256
NA,analysis; it has also been done by firms such as Energetics. What does it mean? We will,256
NA,"achieve our targets and will achieve them easily. Most significantly, we will achieve them",256
NA,without a carbon tax.,256
Mr IRONS ,"Swan) (17:54): Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. My question will be to the",256
NA,"minister, and I am sure that you would be capable of answering the question, as you indicated",256
NA,"earlier, but I will make sure I address it to the minister! It is in relation to the Swan and",256
NA,"Canning rivers in Perth, but first I want to provide the minister with some context, obviously,",256
NA,on environmental issues in my electorate of Swan-environmental volunteering and some,256
NA,previous approaches to the environment in my electorate.,256
NA,"As the minister might know, Swan is like an inland peninsula, surrounded by rivers on",256
NA,three sides while on the eastern side there is a series of small lakes and swamps. It is a very,256
NA,environmentally sensitive area; it is a bit of a jewel in the electorate because there are not,256
NA,NA,256
NA,many people who are aware of it. But I know that the minister has been down there; he visited,257
NA,it with me some time ago. I do appreciate that and the people of Swan appreciated his taking,257
NA,the time to come and look at that particular jewel down in the electorate.,257
NA,The people of my electorate interact with the local environment all the time and,257
NA,environmental issues are therefore particularly important in the electorate. I do remember that,257
NA,"one of the first times I went down to the Canning River regional area, we were in the process",257
NA,of releasing some swans that had been injured. An environmental group in Victoria Park had,257
NA,"retrieved them, saved them and brought them back to health, and we went down one Sunday",257
NA,morning and released them back into the Canning River. The only real negative to that was,257
NA,that about half a dozen planes flew over the top as we were doing it and scared them! But at,257
NA,"the same time, the high aircraft usage over that area does have an effect on the environment",257
NA,down there.,257
NA,"The wetland areas were degraded over time, which has created many issues. Some of the",257
NA,"degradation that we are still dealing with today includes use as a rubbish tip, which was on",257
NA,Burswood Island; dumping of toxic waste at Castledare in Wilson-chemicals being dumped,257
NA,"in the area; asbestos being dumped in the area; and all of this, obviously, was not helped by",257
NA,antisocial behaviour like the dumping of shopping carts from the Carousel shopping centre.,257
NA,"There has also been an issue with the introduction of non-native species and weeds, which",257
NA,have taken over large areas and which have caused problems for aquatic life in the river,257
NA,systems. They have also reduced the biodiversity. A serious example of this is the hydrocotyle,257
NA,"weed, which is one of the things that I showed the minister when he came down and looked at",257
NA,the Wilson Lagoon. That was introduced to the river in the 1980s. For those who do not,257
NA,"know, hydrocotyle is an imported pet weed. It was initially in fish bowls but it was released",257
NA,"into the local river area, unfortunately. In the right conditions it can double its biomass in",257
NA,"three days to a week, creating a green mat over the entire area-particularly on the Wilson",257
NA,"Lagoon. Since then it has caused major problems, and periodically there have been very bad",257
NA,"years of growth; for example, 1992 and 2013-14 have been extremely bad years.",257
NA,"SERCUL, which is one of the local volunteer environmental groups down there-I am sure",257
NA,"the minister is aware of them-has in the past directed over $77,000 to tackling the",257
NA,"hydrocotyle over the past decade. The Two Rivers Catchment Group has directed $27,000 as",257
NA,"well over the same time, but a greater investment is needed to finally get on top of this issue",257
NA,because it is causing enormous damage to the environment down there. This was at the heart,257
NA,of our proposal to the minister for the Swan-Canning River recovery program.,257
NA,Much of the work to remediate the environment will need to be done at the local level by,257
NA,local groups. And even when the funding is delivered the larger body of work also tends to be,257
NA,"done at the local level. The majority of the action involves weeding, revegetation and removal",257
NA,"of the hydrocotyle, which is a pretty difficult issue. I went down there myself with one of the",257
NA,Wilson Wetlands groups and with a group of schoolchildren from Wilson Primary School. I,257
NA,put on some waders and went out into the lagoon and removed some of the hydrocotyle in,257
NA,there. It is an extremely long process which will require a lot of time from the local,257
NA,environment groups.,257
NA,"In the past, the Howard government's appreciation of the need for environmental action at",257
NA,the local level has been a strong focus. The focus under Labor has been solely on climate,257
NA,NA,257
NA,"change and offshore credits, neglecting on-the-ground action down in the areas. This was",258
NA,epitomised by the reduction that NRM had in their funding under the last government.,258
NA,But just to get on to the question: can the minister outline the government's Coastal River,258
NA,Recovery Initiatives program and the areas that will be targeted? And what funding has been,258
NA,"allocated for the Swan-Canning rivers, and how will this improve the environmental health of",258
NA,the waterway?,258
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (17:59): I thank the member for,258
NA,Swan for a comprehensive question. All up the government's coastal rivers recovery plan is,258
NA,"$9.3 million. Of course, there is $1 million that has been allocated for the Swan-Canning",258
NA,"River recovery plan. I will come to that in more detail in just a second. In addition,",258
NA,"particularly with the member for Boothby here, there is $1 million for the River Torrens. He",258
NA,"was a champion and a fighter for that. I also note that the member for Bass, who is here, was",258
NA,an inveterate campaigner for the $3 million for the Tamar River recovery plan. His river was,258
NA,dirtier than yours! So three of the key components of the national coastal rivers recovery plan,258
NA,are represented around the table in the chamber this evening. There was also $3.3 million for,258
NA,Tuggerah Lakes for recovery there as well as $1 million over four years for the Yarra River,258
NA,recovery plan.,258
NA,"Turning to the Swan and Canning rivers, there are three components which are addressed",258
NA,"in the $1 million. Firstly and most significantly is weed removal, eradication and revegetation,",258
NA,"as set out by the member. The hydrocotyle, as you have shown me, is a fundamental problem.",258
NA,Both rivers can be threatened by it. Each river has lagoon systems where the water is not,258
NA,"running so quickly. I have with you inspected the site and, seen the challenge and it was",258
NA,precisely because of those site visits and the support of the community and the state that we,258
NA,determined that this was a genuine and necessary problem. I know it affects electorates of all,258
NA,persuasions. The Labor-held electorate of Perth will also benefit significantly from this,258
NA,"program, as it should. At the end of the day it is about maintaining and improving the health",258
NA,of one of our fundamental urban riparian assets.,258
NA,The second component of the Swan River recovery plan is community education. It is,258
NA,about ensuring that the sorts of shopping trolley issues and urban pollution issues to which the,258
NA,member for Swan refers are mitigated-that they are reduced. The lessons around the country,258
NA,"are very clear: if you engage your schoolchildren early, if you engage your secondary school",258
NA,"students, then you can have an impact on the community as a whole. We cannot guarantee",258
NA,"100 per cent community compliance, because that is the nature of who we are and what we",258
NA,"are as a society, but we can make a dramatic difference.",258
NA,"The third of the changes is in relation to community action, and that is supporting",258
NA,particular community groups to engage in on-the-ground physical work. It could be,258
NA,"replanting, it could be riparian recovery, it may be the development of habitat for threatened",258
NA,species in particular along the Swan and Canning rivers.,258
NA,Only a few short hours ago I did sign-off on a brief allocating the funds to the Perth NRM.,258
NA,"But after consultation with the member, the significant condition which I had placed on it is",258
NA,"twofold. Firstly, the condition is that there will be zero dollars used by the Perth NRM for",258
NA,"administration-100 per cent of the funds, $1 million of the $1 million allocated, must be",258
NA,used for cleaning up river in the three ways outlined. That is a direct consequence of the,258
NA,NA,258
NA,rightful demands of the member for Swan that every dollar goes to cleaning up the Swan and,259
NA,Canning system.,259
NA,The second condition is that the allocations are notified to myself beforehand. That allows,259
NA,proper consultation and openly I say with the member here to ensure that he and other,259
NA,community representatives believe that all recipient bodies are appropriate bodies with full,259
NA,"probity attached to them. We will, of course, do our probity checks but I wanted to make sure",259
NA,that there is a second line of defence. I thank the member. This program would not have,259
NA,"occurred without the support of people such as the member for Bass, the member for Boothby",259
NA,and the member for Swan and this project would certainly not have occurred without the,259
NA,tireless and indefatigable advocacy of the member for Swan.,259
Mr BUTLER ,Port Adelaide) (18:04): I want to ask the minister a couple of questions,259
NA,"about the National Water Commission, which has been abolished under this budget. As the",259
NA,"minister knows, this is an independent statutory authority that has been in place since well",259
NA,before the election of the Rudd government-I think for 10 years or so-that was set up as,259
NA,part of the intergovernmental agreement with COAG on national water issues. Its functions,259
NA,"include triennial assessments of the performance of the states, implementing the National",259
NA,"Water Initiative, advising and reporting on performance of the water industry more broadly",259
NA,"under the National Water Initiative, delivery of the planning report card on the status of water",259
NA,plans that are in place across the country and delivery of national performance reports on the,259
NA,"performance of both urban and rural water utilities. As the minister also knows, the Water",259
NA,Services Association of Australia and the Australian Water Association have both expressed,259
NA,grave concerns about the abolition of the National Water Commission.,259
NA,Some of these questions were asked in Senate estimates without any clear answer. I wonder,259
NA,whether the minister can provide some more clarity around which functions currently,259
NA,undertaken by the Water Commission will be discontinued. For those that will continue to be,259
NA,"undertaken, by whom will they be undertaken? If those decisions have not yet been made-if",259
NA,the minister is not able to answer those questions in detail-when will those decisions be,259
NA,"made and announced to the parliament and, perhaps more importantly, to the sector and to the",259
NA,"community? As I have outlined, the functions of the Water Commission involve very",259
NA,"significant interaction with the states and territories but also with the water industry,",259
NA,represented by the two associations I referred to. I wonder whether the minister can detail the,259
NA,consultation undertaken with those bodies prior to the decision to abolish the water,259
NA,"commission. Also, what discussions have taken place, in regard to those questions I have",259
NA,"raised, with the states and particularly those party to the intergovernmental agreement, since",259
NA,the decision was announced to abolish the Water Commission?,259
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (18:07): In response to the member,259
NA,"for Port Adelaide's question, let me begin with two overarching principles: I began this",259
NA,discussion of the portfolio budget by framing it in the context of the $240 billion deficit,259
NA,overrun which occurred over the last six years. This is done against the backdrop of an,259
NA,"extraordinarily expensive national budgetary crisis which we have faced, so it is something",259
NA,that we have always intended to address and which we said we would address. The second,259
NA,background item here is that the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement has been completed. Much,259
NA,of the preparatory work for that has been done by the National Water Commission and we,259
NA,"have seen, with the grand achievement of the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement having been",259
NA,NA,259
NA,"endorsed by all relevant states, that we now have an operating system which we can all be",260
NA,proud of.,260
NA,The role of the National Water Commission-as somebody who was integrally involved in,260
NA,helping to establish it-was first and foremost aimed at ensuring that we would reach the,260
NA,"Holy Grail of a Murray-Darling Basin agreement. That was its raison d'etre, its purpose, its",260
NA,reason for existence. We have achieved that primary outcome. Institutions at a governmental,260
NA,level are not necessarily meant to live forever. It is sometimes a mark of their success that,260
NA,"they have achieved their outcomes. In a government with over 900 different agencies,",260
NA,"organisations or commissions, if they can then be slimmed down to a number which might",260
NA,well end up being half of that then I think that is a sign of success.,260
NA,"In this particular case, we think that the National Water Commission achieved its",260
NA,outcomes. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement was a fundamental outcome. We are proud,260
NA,"of what has happened. I particularly want to congratulate my parliamentary secretary, Senator",260
NA,"Simon Birmingham, a senator for South Australia. He worked to complete the task which had",260
NA,begun at COAG in 2004 with the Intergovernmental Agreement on a National Water,260
NA,Initiative. That task has been significantly achieved.,260
NA,"In terms of the monitoring and reporting, I can make a statement to the parliament that the",260
NA,functions will overwhelmingly be adopted by the Department of the Environment. They will,260
NA,be brought within the relevant water unit. I think they are well-equipped and capable of,260
NA,handling those functions and will do that with great distinction.,260
Mr NIKOLIC ,"Bass) (18:10): Minister, can I first of all thank you for your commitments",260
NA,"to the Tamar River. As I recall, the genesis of the three-year plan that has just been approved",260
NA,"in the budget was on a famous day, 4 July 2012, on a very cold morning in Launceston, when",260
NA,there were good discussions with some key stakeholders that have resulted in the plan to,260
NA,deliver a healthier Tamar River.,260
NA,I am mindful of the time limitations so I will quickly ask you about the status of the,260
NA,process to procure a new icebreaker to replace the ageing Aurora Australis. Can you outline,260
NA,"the government's commitment in the budget to our Antarctic program, update on the status of",260
NA,the icebreaker and explain how the government's commitment to Antarctica will benefit,260
NA,Tasmania?,260
Mr HUNT ,"Flinders-Minister for the Environment) (18:11): To the member for Bass, let",260
NA,"me make this point. Firstly, as I noted earlier, you were personally an absolute champion, an",260
NA,"indefatigable champion, for the Tamar River recovery program. Secondly, as one of the",260
NA,"Tasmanian team, the member for Bass, along with all others, advocated for the replenishment",260
NA,of the Antarctic program.,260
NA,There are two parts to this: the capital acquisition and the research. The interesting thing is,260
NA,that the need for a new icebreaker was self-evident. The Aurora Australis is the best part of,260
NA,"two decades old. It has really reached the end of its operational lifetime, which will be strung",260
NA,"out for longer perhaps than it should be, but I am assured that all the safety protocols can be",260
NA,"met. Nevertheless, we have needed for some years now a new icebreaker. In this budget we",260
NA,"made the commitment to acquire a new icebreaker, and the funding has been set aside. There",260
NA,was a black hole-critical national infrastructure was not funded. It is now funded. The exact,260
NA,"amount will be subject to a tender but, as I have said elsewhere and earlier, a global figure of",260
NA,NA,260
NA,$500 million covers the cost of the icebreaker and the Bureau of Meteorology's,261
NA,supercomputer easily.,261
NA,What will this do? It will allow us to have a world-class research platform. It will allow us,261
NA,to have a world-class logistics and supply vessel. It will enable us to reinforce the bases at,261
NA,"Mawson, Davis and Casey. In particular, it will allow us to ensure that our sovereignty is",261
NA,"established beyond any point of doubt whatsoever. Under the Antarctic protocols and treaties,",261
NA,"what is fundamental is usage, and if you are not maintaining a presence and usage then you",261
NA,"place at risk your claim for sovereignty. For all those reasons, the new icebreaker is",261
NA,fundamental. But in terms of scientific research we could not have a more valuable,261
NA,fundamental platform.,261
NA,This brings me to the second part of our commitment. There are three programs which we,261
NA,have endorsed which are going to assist with the long-term research and logistics capability of,261
NA,our Antarctic program and are all about establishing Tasmania as the global gateway for,261
NA,"Antarctic activity. Firstly, we have reaffirmed the $25 million for the cooperative research",261
NA,"centre on Antarctica. Secondly, we have established the global gateway partnership between",261
NA,"the University of Tasmania, the CSIRO and the magnificent staff at the Antarctic Division-",261
NA,"all world-class researchers, but I am particularly proud of the researchers at the Antarctic",261
NA,Division led by Tony Fleming.,261
NA,The third thing we have done is to provide $48 million for the extension of the Hobart,261
NA,"runway. That $48 billion serves many purposes. It serves purposes for general commerce,",261
NA,"general tourism and general trade within Tasmania, but in particular it equips the runway to",261
NA,"be a logistics hub for activity in and out of the Antarctic. When you put the new ship, the new",261
NA,"research and the runway together, this is the biggest single investment in Australia's Antarctic",261
NA,program in Australian history. This is a very important step forward. It is critical. It is the,261
NA,"right thing to do for the environment. It is the right thing to do economically, because many",261
NA,other countries have expressed deep interest in having Hobart or Tasmania as their logistics,261
NA,hub for Antarctic activities. And it is the right thing to do in terms of our national strategic,261
NA,interest.,261
NA,"Just before I conclude, I want to thank all the members of the department and my office",261
NA,who worked on the budget. The department staff were led by Matt Whitfort. He and his team,261
NA,"did an extraordinary job during the process of the budget preparation. Within my office, I",261
NA,"want to thank my chief of staff, Wendy Black, and Tamay Rigzin, as well as all the other",261
NA,staff.,261
NA,Proposed expenditure agreed to.,261
NA,Agriculture Portfolio,261
NA,"Proposed expenditure, $485,125,000",261
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The,261
NA,Nationals) (18:16): This is my first roll of the dice in the Federation Chamber in this process,261
NA,of the budget. Agriculture has been a vital industry and will be a vital industry for where our,261
NA,"economy goes. It is a statement of fact that, if we did not have an agriculture industry, then",261
NA,we would not have the nation that we currently see. This nation was in the past strongly,261
NA,"reliant on its development through agriculture, and I believe that that is coming back to the",261
NA,fore again.,261
NA,NA,261
NA,I have been extremely happy with the process that agriculture has been going through since,262
NA,we attained government. I feel there has been a real return to the Australian people because of,262
NA,"that. I note with some interest that, in the quarter ending in March, we had a 19.3 per cent",262
NA,"increase in agricultural income, and it was 19.3 per cent in the same quarter in the previous",262
NA,"year. This shows a trend, and this trend is underwritten by a whole range of factors that we",262
NA,have been concentrating on intently.,262
NA,One of the issues is re-establishing the live cattle and sheep trade in a form that is bringing,262
NA,real dignity back into people's lives. I was happy to see that in Western Australia the other day,262
NA,"they were getting up to $153 for sheep. This brings substantial change to people's lives, who",262
NA,get the dignity of a substantial cheque coming through the door on the sale of sheep. This,262
NA,allows them to reinvest in their property and brings dignity into their lives by allowing them,262
NA,to do some of the things that everybody else takes for granted-maybe it is renovations,262
NA,"around the house, maybe it is buying themselves a new car.",262
NA,This is the sort of outcome you would expect for people who go through the privations of,262
NA,living remote to many social services. If their job is one where they cannot get all the social,262
NA,"services that one would expect, living in an urban environment, then we hope that the quid",262
NA,"pro quo is a reasonable return for their endeavours. I am also happy to see that, in the timber",262
NA,"industry, we are getting a large pick-up in the export of timber. We had a record number of",262
NA,"live cattle moved in April, over 170,000. Prior to that-I think in the month before that-we",262
NA,"had a record amount of frozen beef, 108,000 tonnes. When you stack all these things against",262
NA,"each other, you can see that agriculture is not only starting to provide a real return to the",262
NA,people on the land but also managing to help our nation.,262
NA,"I will give one classic anecdote about that. Back in the month of January, we suspected that",262
NA,"the nation would make a $100 million loss, a $100 million deficit. We actually made a $1.4",262
NA,billion surplus-a $1½ billion turnaround. That was predominantly driven by agriculture. We,262
NA,had an excellent crop coming off in Western Australia-we got about 6.2 million tonnes of,262
NA,"that onto the ships-and we had good outcomes in the live cattle trade, the live sheep trade",262
NA,"and the export of frozen beef, chilled beef and chilled mutton.",262
NA,Let me turn to some other areas. We have managed to finalise a free trade agreement with,262
NA,"Korea, which has brought about a substantial reduction in tariffs, especially in the beef sector,",262
NA,"and ultimately they will go down to zero. We have finalised a trade agreement with Japan,",262
NA,which has brought about a substantial reduction in tariffs. We are currently in the throes of,262
NA,"negotiating the Chinese one. I have had discussions with the Chinese departments, and",262
NA,Minister Gao from China was here in the last fortnight. We were very focused on what we are,262
NA,doing there. Some of the increases in exports to China have been incredible. They have been,262
NA,500 per cent in a year in some sectors. There has been an exponential increase in beef exports.,262
NA,These all augur well for a good outcome.,262
NA,On the back of that we have also had to work closely on drought policy. We have been,262
NA,"managing to deliver good outcomes on drought policy, good outcomes on infrastructure and",262
NA,great outcomes with the recent $100 million further investment in research and development,262
NA,in agriculture. That basically takes our total to around $700 million a year. I look forward to,262
NA,participating in this process over the next 45 minutes. We will see how we go.,262
NA,NA,262
Mr FITZGIBBON ,Hunter) (18:21): This is the Minister for Agriculture's debut in this,263
NA,"process, as he mentioned. I congratulate him on his tie. I do not know whether that counts as",263
NA,"blue, but it is close enough. May the Blues have a great win tonight!",263
NA,I advise the minister that this should be a pretty painless 45 minutes for him. The minister,263
NA,and I have talked often about our best endeavours to take a bipartisan approach to this,263
NA,portfolio. We together believe it is too important an area of public policy to be playing,263
NA,political games with. We are very conscious of the very short political cycle at the federal,263
NA,level-three years-and the need for long-term planning and certainty in this sector.,263
NA,"I am a little bemused though by the minister's own scorecard, claiming that everything that",263
NA,has happened in a positive sense in agriculture over the last 10 months has been due to the,263
NA,good work of the Abbott government. I challenge him throughout these 45 minutes to tell me,263
NA,"how the rise in timber exports, the increases in frozen beef exports-and he mentioned that",263
NA,"about four times-the bumper wheat harvest and the free trade agreements, signed or",263
NA,"otherwise, are as a result of anything he has done.",263
NA,He will of course claim some success in the live trade. He is always very keen to mention,263
NA,that. He mentioned that four times as well. I often think that for the minister if it does not moo,263
NA,it does not matter. This is a very diverse portfolio. I understand how important the beef,263
NA,"industry is in this portfolio but there are other dimensions, Minister, to the agriculture",263
NA,"portfolio, including forestry and fisheries, which you decided not to include in the name of the",263
NA,portfolio.,263
NA,The minister can attempt to claim credit for all of these things but he will need to provide,263
NA,over the next 45 minutes some evidence of something he has done that led to the outcomes he,263
NA,has been talking about. Of course he will say that things have improved in the live trade,263
NA,sector. I have said many times that the pause in the live trade sector was unfortunate and I,263
NA,"regret it. I would like to think that, if I were the minister at the time, there would have been",263
NA,other alternatives available to the government. I often also make the point that this country,263
NA,probably would not have the best animal welfare system in the world now-ESCAS-if it,263
NA,were not for the pause. It is doubtful that the industry would have ever embraced ESCAS if,263
NA,the industry had not been paused. Those opposite when they were in opposition always,263
NA,"criticised ESCAS, but now in government whenever they are in a battle with those who have",263
NA,as their key focus animal welfare they invoke ESCAS as the great system that Australia,263
NA,possesses now as a defence against those charges.,263
NA,"I believe the government has got off to a pretty slow start in agriculture, and I am here to",263
NA,"help in any way I can. I think the agriculture white paper, while possibly justifiable, presents",263
NA,policy inertia for the country at a time when we are really in a hurry. We have hundreds of,263
NA,"reports on reviewing the industry, reviewing our outlook and reviewing where we need to go",263
NA,as a sector. I think it is just time that we got on with it rather than spend a year trying to,263
NA,reinvent all those reports through the white paper. I notice the member for Hume here. He is,263
NA,the author of one of those very good reports. Maybe if the minister had just spoken to the,263
NA,"member for Hume, we could all have saved some time.",263
NA,I am excited about the Agriculture portfolio and the agriculture sector. I believe that what I,263
NA,have described as the dining boom presents this sector with enormous opportunities. The,263
NA,extent to which we capitalise on those opportunities will depend on how hard we work at,263
NA,"those aspirations. We do need strategic plans, proper assessments of where we are going, and",263
NA,NA,263
NA,we need a big injection of infrastructure in our supply chains. The dining boom is not going to,264
NA,deliver for Australia because we are lucky. The dining boom will only deliver for Australia if,264
NA,"we put in the effort, we have the correct strategic plans, we attract the investment we need in",264
NA,"those supply chains and government policy is set correctly. Of course, it will not be just about",264
NA,"larger volumes. It cannot be just about volumes. To pluck a number out of the air, we might",264
NA,"be able to increase volumes threefold, but that will not bring us the dining boom as I aspire it",264
NA,to be. It is high yields and high-value products which will deliver off the back of the dining,264
NA,"boom, and that is where we need to focus. R&D will be very important. (Time expired)",264
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The,264
NA,Nationals) (18:26): I think it is important to reply in kind at the first available opportunity to,264
NA,what the shadow minister has brought about. Today one was the monkey grinder and the other,264
NA,was the clown-,264
NA,An honourable member: Organ grinder!,264
Mr JOYCE, Right. But I do commend the shadow minister because I do believe that,264
NA,there is a general view that agriculture policy is similar to defence policy. It has to be,264
NA,"consistent. We do not want wild oscillations of policy, because people on farms do not plan",264
NA,"for three years, they plan for 30 years, and therefore we need consistency. I am sure the",264
NA,endeavours of both sides will be to make good decisions better rather than make holistic,264
NA,changes that create major uncertainty.,264
NA,I would also like to commend the work that has been done over such a long period of time,264
NA,"by John Cobb, who is here today. He has had very strong involvement at a personal level,",264
NA,"owning a farm, in agri-politics and also in politics itself. However, I have to take up one thing",264
NA,straightaway. People ask: 'What are some of the major changes?' I will give you a major,264
NA,change between when the Howard government finished and when the Rudd-Gillard-,264
NA,"whomever government finished. When the Howard coalition government finished, the budget",264
NA,in agriculture was $3.48 billion. In the last Labor budget it was $1.6 billion. So the Labor,264
NA,Party cut $1.88 billion over their tenure. This is a substantive change for our attention. I look,264
NA,forward to the opposition's policy showing reinvigoration for that. How their policy addresses,264
NA,some of the issues rests a lot on the shadow minister's shoulders. One thing I do want is real,264
NA,competition-competition of ideas-because that helps progress where agriculture goes.,264
NA,"I can quickly point to some clear changes. When we came in, we had the concessional farm",264
NA,"finance package, which I acknowledge the Labor Party drew up but they just never signed it",264
NA,"off. Because it was never signed off, it could not be delivered. We had a package which was",264
NA,not signed off and was not actually designed for the people who were to use it. We had to,264
NA,"completely recalibrate it. Because we wanted to get all the states and territories signed off, we",264
NA,"had to go around to get them all to sign off. To the extent it was designed, it was inoperable,",264
NA,because it wasn't signed off by all the states and territories. We had to do that and we had to,264
NA,"reallocate money. So we had the same amount of money, God bless them, going to",264
NA,Tasmania-that is fair enough-as we had going to Queensland. One area was in the middle,264
NA,of a drought and the other area wasn't suffering the privations of a drought. We did that. It,264
NA,"was the coalition that did that, and the people are getting that money because we organised",264
NA,that.,264
NA,The next thing is we also found money for water-that is definitely something that we did;,264
NA,"$10 million-and we have been receiving strong support in that policy initiative, because",264
NA,NA,264
NA,people like the capacity of getting new watering points out on their place. That is something,265
NA,we did.,265
NA,"On 4 March we got the changes to the interim farm family payment, and now over 1,400",265
NA,farming families who have been doing it tough have been receiving payments in access of,265
NA,"$900 a fortnight. It is amazing when people say, 'You haven't actually done anything in",265
NA,agriculture. You haven't got any money out.' That is an awful lot of money and it has been,265
NA,"going out, and we have been doing that. So we did that.",265
NA,The free trade agreement to Korea was not signed off; we did that-that was another thing,265
NA,"we did. The progress that has been made with the ag white paper, which was a clear statement",265
NA,by the coalition of their intent to have a holistic and very discerning view on where,265
NA,agriculture goes and create a policy format that becomes not a direction of the- (Time,265
NA,expired),265
Mr FITZGIBBON ,Hunter) (18:31): I will invite the minister before closing tonight to,265
NA,"give the parliament an update on the white paper, the timing of the initial paper, the final",265
NA,paper and maybe some information about the process leading up to the completion of that,265
NA,document. I will ask the minister next time he gets to his feet to tell me exactly where. He has,265
NA,"cited live trade, timber exports, frozen beef, bumper wheat harvests-and I assume he was",265
NA,referring to WA-and the free trade agreement. I ask him how what he describes as,265
NA,reconfiguration of the concessional loans package brought any of those outcomes; how,265
NA,"additional money for water infrastructure, as he calls it, has brought any of those outcomes;",265
NA,"how the family payment-and of course there has always been a family payment, Minister-",265
NA,"has brought any of those five outcomes; and how the free trade agreement, which is not yet",265
NA,"ratified, has brought any of those five outcomes you boasted about and claimed credit for",265
NA,tonight.,265
NA,I have got so many questions to ask. I wasn't sure where to start but you have taken us to,265
NA,"the concessional loans scheme, so it is probably as good a place as any. You said, Minister,",265
NA,that you reconfigured Labor's concessional loans scheme. It is untrue to say that the states,265
NA,"were not signed up. There was one outstanding state, Western Australia, when I left office-",265
NA,"and you do not need to look to your advisers; I can confirm that for you, Minister; I can assure",265
NA,you that that is the case. It is true that you took money off some states and transferred those,265
NA,"amounts of money to other states-and of course the losers were the smaller states of WA,",265
NA,"Tasmania and South Australia. You say that that was a ridiculous arrangement, because some",265
NA,"of those states obviously were not suffering bad drought-partly true, Minister. But you have",265
NA,to recall that the concessional loans scheme wasn't a drought package; it was a drought relief,265
NA,"package and, when it was constructed, the farm sector in Australia was not facing severe",265
NA,"drought. It was never a drought package. Yes, if drought was one of the reasons farmers were",265
NA,"struggling to deal with their debt, then that would feed into that process. So it is wrong to say",265
NA,"that, Minister, and you know it is wrong.",265
NA,My question to you specifically on this is: what methodology was used to determine which,265
NA,states would receive the amounts taken from the smaller states? What consultation was,265
NA,"undertaken with the smaller states before that money was taken? More particularly, the money",265
NA,you took away was more than the money you distributed to Queensland and New South,265
NA,"Wales-a substantial difference; $40 million, if I remember correctly. You made a",265
NA,commitment that that $40 million would be put back into the concessional loans system-that,265
NA,NA,265
NA,"is, the original concessional loans scheme. I ask you: has that money been put back; and, if",266
NA,"not, do you still guarantee that that $40 million will be returned to that particular package?",266
NA,"I take you to your package, Minister, what I call the drought concessional loans scheme,",266
NA,"which you implied tonight is assisting farmers as we speak, but, as I pointed out in question",266
NA,"time today, on my last advice-and I would be very surprised if it has changed-not one",266
NA,farming family or farm enterprise has been a beneficiary of that drought concessional loan,266
NA,package since its implementation. I remind you that you first announced that scheme late in,266
NA,February. We are now well into June and that has not been bedded down. You stand here and,266
NA,"criticise the design of Labor's concessional loans scheme, which, as you know, is flowing to",266
NA,"farm enterprises and farm families, and yet your own scheme is not flowing. So I would really",266
NA,"appreciate answers to what I think are very, very reasonable questions.",266
NA,"On the issue of the transitional or family payment, you know that welfare payment has",266
NA,always been part of drought. It is the one thing that has survived the COAG reforms. You,266
NA,should not claim that that is a big step up by this government. We were happy to support the,266
NA,"changes you made and facilitate them to the parliament, but you might tell me whether it is",266
NA,true that those who are in receipt of those payments are therefore denied certain social,266
NA,services under the rural counselling scheme. I was just outside Emerald last week and I was,266
NA,informed that people are being denied certain services under what is generally known as the,266
NA,rural counselling scheme because they have taken up the offer under that family payment,266
NA,"arrangement. If you would confirm that for me, it would be very much appreciated.",266
Dr GILLESPIE ,Lyne) (18:36): Australia is incredibly fortunate to have a very high,266
NA,status of freedom from a vast array of exotic pests and diseases. If any of those were to,266
NA,"establish themselves here in Australia, it would potentially decimate large sections of our",266
NA,primary industry sector. You only have to look at the Varroa mite and the colony collapse,266
NA,"disorder that has affected the bee industry overseas and the screw-worm fly, which exists as",266
NA,"close as Papua New Guinea. There was an isolated outbreak in Wagga; fortunately, it was",266
NA,"snuffed out. Karnal bunt is a fungal disease of wheat found in the USA, and there is a vector",266
NA,"insect, the glassy-winged sharpshooter, which introduces Pierce's disease, can decimate the",266
NA,"wine and grape industry and is afflicting the North American grape industry. Recently, we",266
NA,"have had the Asian longhorn beetle, the brown mulberry longhorn beetle and Japanese soya",266
NA,beetles identified in some wood products. There were some press releases about it. You can,266
NA,"see what potentially could have happened to apples, pears and stone fruits. Some months ago,",266
NA,a chocolate banded snail outbreak was also identified. So there are all these exotic pests and,266
NA,diseases.,266
NA,"Our overseas colleagues and trading partners say that a lot of this is just a beat-up, but",266
NA,"really it is a major threat to our isolated flora and fauna. Minister, in light of these ever-",266
NA,"present threats that exotic pests and disease pose to us, how important is it to get the correct",266
NA,government structures and governance in place for our national biosecurity efforts?,266
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mrs Andrews): I call the minister.,266
Mr Fitzgibbon," Madam Deputy Speaker, I am on my feet at the table. Why would you",266
NA,not be calling me?,266
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, Because the last time you jumped to your feet-,266
NA,NA,266
Mr Fitzgibbon," Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sorry. You must go government then",267
NA,opposition.,267
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," Excuse me, the last time you spoke you did not have the call.",267
NA,I had not given the call to you and you had spoken twice. I have given the call to the minister.,267
NA,Please resume your seat.,267
Mr Fitzgibbon," If you do not call me, Madam Deputy Speaker-",267
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, Resume your seat.,267
Mr Fitzgibbon, You cannot do this.,267
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, Resume your seat.,267
Mr Fitzgibbon," No, you must give the opposition the call on this occasion. You might",267
NA,want to seek advice from the clerks. I am happy to give you that opportunity.,267
Mr Joyce," Don't let them bully you, Madam Deputy Speaker.",267
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, I give the call to the minister to respond to questions so far.,267
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The,267
NA,Nationals) (18:39): I intend to address some of the issues that were brought up by both the,267
NA,"shadow minister and the member for Lyne. I have now been advised by the department that,",267
NA,"when we had carriage of the concessional farm finance package, there were only three",267
NA,"states-Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria-that had signed off on it. The statement",267
NA,made by the shadow minister of 'all but one' is incorrect. We had three. In the Commonwealth,267
NA,"of Australia there are more than three states, last time I checked, so we had to get the others to",267
NA,sign off. We had to progress this deal. There is always an issue with picking up the paperwork,267
NA,from the Labor Party and trying to finish the job off. They never get there. It is always like a,267
NA,"packet of poo tickets caught in the corner. You have to try to fix it up, sweep it up together",267
NA,and try to make some sense out of it.,267
NA,"What we also had was this complete confusion. Yes, there was a presumption that the",267
NA,number of farmers we had in Tasmania-and Tasmania is a great place-was the same as the,267
NA,number of farmers we had in New South Wales. It was an absurdity. After we got everybody,267
NA,"signed off, we had to redesign the whole thing to make it work.",267
NA,"With regard to some states, and I refer to Western Australia, they placed conditions on how",267
NA,they were going to lend the money in that concessional farm finance package out. It did make,267
NA,"it vastly more restrictive than other states, and it was difficult for those farmers to get access",267
NA,"to it. So what did we do? When we got the $320 million package through, we made it so that",267
NA,it was generic-so that people could get an equivalent loan in different states and territories.,267
NA,This is the sort of process you do to try to make a program work.,267
NA,"Moving on to biosecurity: biosecurity is terribly important. I think that, throughout the",267
NA,"room, people understand that if we do not maintain our most competitive advantage-that is,",267
NA,"our clean, green image-then we have real concerns. That is why, even in the last week, we",267
NA,have been on the front foot making sure we deal with the detection of three beetles. It might,267
NA,"sound innocuous, but they were not George, Paul and Ringo. We had the longhorn beetle, the",267
NA,mulberry beetle and the sawyer beetle and these have the capacity to devastate our timber,267
NA,"industry, as they have devastated Canada's. We have been on the front foot. We have been",267
NA,ventilating this issue. We have been making sure that we track it down. We have been getting,267
NA,NA,267
NA,"the quarantine in place and collecting all but, we believe, a few pallets that are around",268
NA,Adelaide. This is where we have to make sure we have the competencies in that field that are,268
NA,so apparent in the Department of Agriculture. I am happy; we stand behind that program and,268
NA,are making sure the Department of Agriculture has a front-line role in all the mechanisms of,268
NA,connection so that we can detect these issues.,268
NA,"If we had an incursion of foot-and-mouth disease, the person who brought it in would",268
NA,probably not even realise they had it. They could have been backpacking in Nepal. If they,268
NA,"brought it in, we would have to shut down the beef industry, the sheep industry, the wool",268
NA,"industry, live cattle exports-the whole lot. The whole lot would shut down. It is absolutely",268
NA,imperative that we keep up our image and we are doing that.,268
Mr FITZGIBBON ,"Hunter) (18:43): That was a filibuster, but I agree with the minister",268
NA,"that our clean, green, safe image is our greatest competitive advantage. I challenge the",268
NA,minister when he is next on his feet to tell us what any initiatives of the government-this,268
NA,"government-have added, in the course of the last ten months, to biosecurity in this country.",268
NA,"The minister likes to talk about concessional loans in the areas where he feels confident,",268
NA,and of course he has some advice about three states. My advice was different. We will have to,268
NA,"agree to disagree on that, Minister. But you did not answer my specific question, so I am",268
NA,therefore going to come to some conclusions about the answers. You chose not to guarantee,268
NA,this House that the $40 million would be returned to the original concessional loans package;,268
NA,"therefore, I can only come to the conclusion that that money is back off to consolidated",268
NA,revenue and will be denied to the farm enterprises of this country.,268
NA,You did not deny that no-one in this country is a beneficiary of your drought farm,268
NA,"financing package so, on that basis, I assume the answer to that is 'yes'-that is true: no-one is",268
NA,yet a recipient. You did imply that it is all fixed now and ready to go but my advice is still is,268
NA,"that it is only Queensland farmers that have access to that scheme, so if you are not prepared",268
NA,"to tell me otherwise then I think it is reasonable for me to assume, and for farming families",268
NA,"out there across the country to assume, that that is also true. I would invite you to answer",268
NA,those questions.,268
NA,"Of course, you did not advise me that consultation was undertaken with the smaller states",268
NA,"before that money was ripped away from them so, again, I can only assume that you are",268
NA,confirming by your silence the assertion I have made.,268
NA,I want to move on to research and development. I made the point at the end of my opening,268
NA,"remarks that it is research and development and innovation that, more than anything, is the",268
NA,"extension that will bring us the real opportunities in the dining boom. I do note, and I",268
NA,"congratulate the government, for fulfilling its election commitment to put an extra $100",268
NA,"million into R&D-over a four-year period, I should mark. But that is a welcome thing. I",268
NA,"invite more detail from the minister about how that money will be spent, and I also ask the",268
NA,"minister what the net effect of R&D is in agriculture, given that it seems he did enhance R&D",268
NA,spending on one side but cut R&D funding to organisations like RIDC-the Rural Industries,268
NA,Development Corporation-to organisations like the CSIRO and to various CRCs in this,268
NA,"country. Indeed, this includes certain higher learning institutions. So I do ask the minister",268
NA,whether he can tell us what the net contribution to R&D in the agriculture sector will be as a,268
NA,result of those two sides of the formula.,268
NA,NA,268
NA,"I would also ask him about another very important area, and that is regional sustainability.",269
NA,It was a great disappointment to me that resource sustainability did not form part of his terms,269
NA,of reference for his agricultural white paper. I just do not understand how you can talk about,269
NA,agriculture's future in this country and the opportunities in Asia without talking about how we,269
NA,"produce more food with the same limited and, in some cases depleted, people, land and water",269
NA,"resources. That leads me to questions on a bill that has just been introduced today, and that is",269
NA,the government's Carbon Farming Initiative. He might want to address my primary concern in,269
NA,"that area, and that is the likely noncompetitiveness of the agriculture sector when bidding for",269
NA,funding under that scheme.,269
NA,"I would expect, Minister, that there are many other areas of the economy which will be able",269
NA,to abate carbon much more cheaply and competitively than will the agriculture sector.,269
NA,"Therefore, I am concerned in this reverse auction-type arrangement that the government",269
NA,"proposes in the parliament, that the agriculture sector simply is not going to be able to",269
NA,"compete for funding under the new Carbon Farming Initiative, and therefore will be cut off",269
NA,from assistance under that scheme.,269
NA,"In addition, I understand that the R&D component of the former regime will be reduced, if",269
NA,"not abolished, further undermining the capacity of agriculture to secure credits under that",269
NA,"scheme. So if the minister could help us better understand that, that would be very much",269
NA,appreciated.,269
NA,"Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (18:48): Initially, I mostly want to speak on the APVMA,",269
NA,"which is a semiautonomous body but which has the ability to affect agriculture profitability,",269
NA,"efficiency, ability to export and what we allow to come into Australia enormously.",269
NA,Twenty-five years ago Australia was the first place that chemical and veterinary medical,269
NA,companies came to get their products registered because if it was accepted here then it was,269
NA,"accepted right around the world. It was efficient, it was fast and it was very well-respected.",269
NA,That has changed to an enormous degree. We are now the last place that chemical and,269
NA,veterinary medicines are brought to be registered. It must be remembered that we are not a big,269
NA,market in the scheme of things and a lot of companies feel that they do not need to cater for,269
NA,some of the things that we do need.,269
NA,"I realise that, and I appreciate the shadow minister falling in with us on the amendments to",269
NA,the legislation that got rid of the issue of having to automatically re-register chemicals on a,269
NA,"time frame. That was ludicrous, and it is good to be shot of it. However, that does not make or",269
NA,"force the APVMA to meet time frames, which they have never done-they have ignored them",269
NA,"in the past. It has not meant that they have to take notice, particularly with chemicals, of",269
NA,"countries that are as good as the USA and Canada, who do not want to kill their population or",269
NA,their animals or their plants either. They do very good work. The APVMA is not forced to,269
NA,make use of work they have already done. They always reinvent the wheel-the legislation,269
NA,allows them to. But as they have not done it at any time recently why would they want to do it,269
NA,now?,269
NA,I think that the only way that the bureaucracy will do what they do not want to do is if they,269
NA,are forced to by competition. I am interested to know if we as a government are looking at,269
NA,making some of the testing contestable so that outside sources can come and do it-certainly,269
NA,"as well and, I am sure, a damn sight faster than the APVMA does. They have enormous",269
NA,"ability to help agriculture, which is not actually its job-its job is to protect people-by being",269
NA,NA,269
NA,"fast and efficient, and a hell of a lot faster and more efficient than they are now. The fact that",270
NA,this is totally cost recoverable means that they feel no pressure to get a move on at the best of,270
NA,times.,270
NA,I am very interested to know if we are looking at contestability and what we are doing. It is,270
NA,obviously not good enough for a government to say that this is an autonomous body and they,270
NA,are a creature of government. We either force them to do what they should do well by making,270
NA,it contestable or by legislating to make them. I am very interested to hear where we are going,270
NA,"on this. I appreciate the amendments to the legislation, but, to me, one of the biggest things",270
NA,facing agriculture is the bureaucracy and the bodies which we pay for and control working,270
NA,with agriculture and not seeing themselves as regulators and agriculture as their creature.,270
NA,One other question I have is where we are up to in assisting the Queensland government in,270
NA,dealing with their issues of Johne's disease in the north with cattle.,270
Mr FITZGIBBON ,Hunter) (18:52): I take this brief opportunity to simply reinforce the,270
NA,questions that I have put to the minister on the various concessional loans schemes. My,270
NA,additional question is: can the minister advise the House what will happen to the $40 million,270
NA,"budgeted this financial year under the Drought Concessional Loans Scheme, given that it is",270
NA,hardly likely that he is going to be able to spend that money this fiscal year?,270
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The,270
NA,Nationals) (18:52): To the member for Calare: I would not jump the gun that he has actually,270
NA,got these amendments through the Senate. It is actually stalled in the Senate. We have got,270
NA,ourselves a bit of a-,270
Mr Fitzgibbon," It has stalled in the Senate, Minister? That is news to me.",270
Mr JOYCE," So we have got a few problems over there, and that is not the first piece of",270
NA,legislation that has stalled over there by reason of the Labor Party.,270
NA,I just want to quickly go through a couple of the things that were also brought up by the,270
NA,"member for Calare. With regard to APVMA, I acknowledge that there is a strong desire in",270
NA,some instances by people wanting the minister to have a greater determination in what is,270
NA,available. This would move away from the belief in the independent scientists having,270
NA,"complete oversight. As I have said before, I have to be little bit cautious because, if I had",270
NA,"greater oversight, then maybe I would approve the use of DDT. But I do hear what you are",270
NA,"saying. We do have the discussions with the independent scientists, especially in more recent",270
NA,"times on fenthion, to try to make sure that we can get the greatest amount of information that",270
NA,we can possibly get on how we can work with growers so that we can assist them.,270
NA,If there were to be a greater say for the minister it would require a legislative change and I,270
NA,"think quite some discernment into what latitude you gave the minister, because just as you can",270
NA,assist people you could also end up in a position-hopefully neither myself nor the shadow,270
NA,minister but maybe somebody else who has a completely different view on the world-where,270
NA,they would go beyond where the independent scientists wish to be and would start banning,270
NA,things that would otherwise have no reason to be banned.,270
NA,I have had discussions lately at my office with a major chemical provider and it works both,270
NA,ways. He was saying that we were too quick and that it was not given the proper oversight,270
NA,and therefore the major chemical company felt that they were exposed because Australia in,270
NA,some instances is too quick in its registration of chemicals and they did not believe that their,270
NA,NA,270
NA,"intellectual property was well protected in that space. However, I do note and I have noted",271
NA,from my own ministerial advisory council precisely the issues the member for Calare brought,271
NA,"up, and that is that people want a greater capacity for APVMA to use existing knowledge as",271
NA,has been determined overseas and also to not completely go back over covered ground in,271
NA,registration of certain chemicals. I am having that discussion with APVMA via my,271
NA,department on precisely that.,271
NA,"With the issue of Johne's disease, there has been a request by Queensland for us to include",271
NA,in our levy structure a levy to assist Queensland in the eradication of bovine Johne's disease. I,271
NA,"have a hesitancy to do that because, first of all, the Auditor-General has told me to have",271
NA,"hesitancy because I am not allowed to. Apart from that, it opens a bit of a Pandora's box that",271
NA,"every state then, when they want a levy, will arrive at the door of the federal government to",271
NA,impose it. Queensland has an alternate capacity to create a levy to control bovine Johne's,271
NA,disease themselves. I do not want to start picking up their washing.,271
NA,"Going back to the issue of concessional loans, as I have said, Western Australia being a",271
NA,"classic example, if on the concessional farm finance package, which I commend the shadow",271
NA,minister for now calling the drought package- (Time expired),271
Mr TAYLOR ,Hume) (18:58): I have spoken many times in this and other chambers,271
NA,"about the opportunity in agriculture. I know the minister has spoken about that earlier, as has",271
NA,"the member for Hunter. In the time that remains, my question for the minister is: how will the",271
NA,agricultural white paper help the farmers of Australia to capture the fast-growing,271
NA,opportunities in agricultural markets in Asia?,271
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Leader of The,271
NA,"Nationals) (18:58): I thank the member for Hume, who I know has a very strong and very",271
NA,deliberate understanding and passion in agriculture. The white paper has received close to 680,271
NA,"submissions. It has had more submissions to it, I believe, than any other white paper that has",271
NA,"ever been-in recent memory, anyhow-before the parliament. So I am informed. I am",271
NA,"willing to be corrected, but that is the mail I am getting at this point in time. We have had",271
NA,around 25 face-to-face meetings-,271
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,271
Mr JOYCE, Does it? How many has it got?,271
NA,An opposition member: Over a thousand.,271
Mr JOYCE," Okay, I stand corrected. If you are correct, it is 18c.",271
NA,"With his information we have the capacity to deliver a policy platform, because ultimately",271
NA,this becomes a policy document. I have carriage of it but I do not have the passage of it,271
NA,"through cabinet. It becomes a document of the Prime Minister. As I have said before, if you",271
NA,"vote against it, it is called a 'career move'!",271
NA,An honourable member: Stop it!,271
Mr JOYCE, You are using time up! I want to get back to his concessional loan issue-I,271
NA,"think it is only fair. With the white paper, we have had the issues paper out, we are eminently",271
NA,"about to release the green paper, which is the range of alternatives, and from that we intend",271
NA,the white paper and its conclusion will be drawn down around about November or December.,271
NA,"With this it will be able to cover everything from infrastructure, such as we are currently",271
NA,NA,271
NA,"driving towards inland rail, creating greater connectivity between mining infrastructure and",272
NA,agricultural infrastructure. Also as part of that purpose I have been appointed as the Minister,272
NA,for Agriculture to be chairman of the dams committee. We all know that water is wealth and,272
NA,when the Prime Minister decides to have a dams committee and there must be an intention to,272
NA,build dams.,272
NA,Our nation in 1980 had about 4½ megs of storage per person. We are down to around 3½,272
NA,now. If we continue on our way we are going to be down to about 2½ megs of storage in,272
NA,2050. That is just insufficient. Australia has to take the next step in dams. This will be,272
NA,"something that I hope we get, because I know the Australian people want us to take the next",272
NA,step-overwhelmingly. There will always be a contingent that lives with the benefaction of,272
NA,"dams and the benefaction of so many resources, but they never want anyone else to advance",272
NA,"their position. But I believe this nation in the dams committee, which is also an integral part",272
NA,"and is meshed within the white paper, is going to be so very important in advancing",272
NA,"agriculture in new parts of this nation, especially in the North.",272
NA,I note that the member for Flynn is here. In the Fitzroy catchment are some of the better,272
NA,dam sites in this nation. We have already been dealing with it. One of the biggest inhibitors of,272
NA,us actually progressing the dams issue in so many instances is excessive environmental green,272
NA,"tape. We have the engineers that can do it, we have a workman who can do it, we have the",272
NA,"plant operators who can do it, we have the farmers who can benefit from it and we have the",272
NA,hydroelectricity we can generate off it. The biggest impediment is ourselves. We have got to,272
NA,"make sure that we reduce that impediment-not remove that impediment completely, but",272
NA,reduce that impediment in certain areas to do something that allows us to progress.,272
NA,"In the member for Flynn's electorate, Nathan Dam is held up by the boggomoss snail. This",272
NA,"boggomoss snail is almost but not quite as powerful as the Booroolong frog, which managed",272
NA,to stop Chaffey Dam for I do not know how many years. But the boggomoss snail has been,272
NA,having a whale of a time and it is holding up a fundamental mechanism for the advancement,272
NA,of the economy in the Fitzroy Basin for both flood mitigation for the development of jobs and,272
NA,"also doing something that the Australian people have always wanted to do, and that is move",272
NA,water from one catchment into the Murray-Darling. We can do that. We have the capacity to,272
NA,"do that. Likewise, a dam that was in my area on the Apsley River was stopped by Neville",272

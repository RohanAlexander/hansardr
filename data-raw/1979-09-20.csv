NA,December last year and January of this year,22
NA,when he stated:,22
NA,Get off your tails and start hunting for jobs because the,22
NA,Government is not going to hand them to you.,22
NA,"Further, he stated:",22
NA,To make work and work generating initiatives fashionable,22
NA,"to them, a real impact will have to be made on the cool",22
NA,to: young to whom dole bludging is a bit of a joke rather than,22
NA,something to be overcome if humanly possible.,22
NA,Is this the philosophy behind and the reason,22
NA,for the Government's decision to slash the,22
NA,Budget appropriation for the Special Youth Em-,22
NA,ployment Training Program by $5 5m or 69 per,22
NA,cent?,22
Mr VINER,A s the honourable gentleman,22
NA,"knows, the funding in this year's Budget for the",22
NA,Special Youth Employment Training Program,22
NA,flows from two decisions made last year. The first,22
NA,Notice of Motion decision was made in the Budget of 1978 when,22
NA,the period of training was reduced from six,22
NA,"months to 17 weeks and the amount of rebate,",22
NA,"that is, subsidies to employers, was reduced from",22
NA,$64 to $45 per week. In December 1978 the,22
NA,Government decided that in order to cut out em-,22
NA,ployer abuse of the Special Youth Employment,22
NA,Training Program it would review the eligibility,22
NA,criteria so that the young unemployed people,22
NA,who would benefit from the program would be,22
NA,those who would not meet the normal employ-,22
NA,ment requirements of an employer. These people,22
NA,"might be termed the hard core unemployed, that",22
NA,"generis, those young people who, because of a lack of",22
NA,educational competence or some other attri-,22
NA,"butes, find it very difficult in a tight labour mar-",22
NA,ket to obtain employment. We thought- I think,22
NA,quite properly-tha t the public money which we,22
NA,were putting into this program should be put to,22
NA,the most effective use possible. We do not be-,22
NA,"Notice of Motion lieve, as the Australian Council of Trade Unions",22
NA,"does not believe, that the Government should be",22
NA,providing a direct wage subsidy to employers in,22
NA,those circumstances. Therefore we limited the,23
NA,target group of young people to the speciaUy,23
NA,disadvantaged in the current labour market.,23
NA,From those two decisions in August 1978 and,23
NA,December 1978 flowed inevitable funding,23
NA,consequences which appear in this year's Budget,23
NA,in which we have provided enough funds for the,23
NA,anticipated demand by employers and the needs,23
NA,of this particular young unemployed group. Of,23
NA,"course the other side of our funding, which the",23
NA,"Opposition is not prepared to acknowledge, is",23
NA,the massive increase in the funds that we are,23
NA,making available to assist apprentices through,23
NA,our Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-,23
NA,time Training Scheme. We have almost doubled,23
NA,to $55m the amount of money that we are pro-,23
NA,viding to employers to engage more apprentices.,23
NA,When we are in a time of economic recovery and,23
NA,when there is increasing demand by industry for,23
NA,skilled workers and a demand by young people,23
NA,"to obtain a skill, I think one",23
NA,behind the priority of the Government in putting,23
NA,$55m towards apprenticeship support.,23
NA,NAVY PATROL BOATS,23
Mr DEAN,Ca n the Minister for Defence in-,23
NA,form the House on progress with construction of,23
NA,15 new patrol boats for the Navy which are,23
NA,being built in nonh Queensland? Is the project,23
NA,proceeding satisfactorily? Will the lead ship question.,23
NA,being constructed in the United Kingdom be,23
NA,delivered to the Navy on time?,23
Mr KILLEN,Th e lead ship HMAS Fremanwhat,23
NA,"tle, which is being constructed in the United",23
NA,"Kingdom by Brooke Marine Ltd, was due to",23
NA,enter Australian waters towards the end of,23
NA,year. I regret to inform the honourable gentle-,23
NA,man and the House that she will not now arrive,23
NA,in Australian waters until February next year. I,23
NA,shall explain briefly to the House the reason,23
NA,that. Trials have indicated that the lead ship,23
NA,overweight by approximately 20 tonnes. I make,23
NA,"it clear also that the Australian Government,",23
NA,"Australian taxpayer, is completely protected by",23
NA,way of an indemnity. The honourable gentleman,23
NA,"will appreciate that North Queensland Engin55,000.",23
NA,"eers and Agents Pty Ltd, which is building the",23
NA,"follow-on boats in Cairns in north Queensland,",23
NA,doing so following the specifications prepared,23
NA,"Brooke Marine. As a consequence of that, boats",23
NA,"2,3 and possibly 4 may be overweight.",23
NA,I can assure the honourable gentleman,23
NA,House that trials are continuing to see in what,23
NA,manner and form the overweight can be,23
NA,reduced. Present trials indicate that the overexisted,23
NA,weight has been caused by oversized hull,23
NA,"plating, hull fitting and some equipment. I am taxpayer.",23
NA,informed on technical and professional advice,23
NA,that there are good grounds for optimism that,23
NA,the overweight problem will be substantially,23
NA,reduced in relation to the boats to which I have,23
NA,adverted. As to the other boats which will follow,23
NA,"on, there will be no problem in existence.",23
NA,UNEMPLOYMENT,23
Mr HOWE,I direct my question to the Min-,23
NA,ister for Employment and Youth Affairs. Is it a,23
NA,fact that Australia has nearly the highest rate of,23
NA,youth unemployment in the Organisation for,23
NA,Economic Co-operation and Development coun-,23
NA,tries? Is it also a fact that 60 per cent of our un-,23
NA,employed are under the age of 25 years? Is it also,23
NA,a fact that Italy is the only other country in the,23
NA,OECD where the unemployment rate has risen,23
NA,above the 60 per centfigure?Why has Australia,23
NA,performed so poorly in providing jobs for young,23
NA,people in comparison with the rest of the devel-,23
NA,can see the purpose oped world?,23
Mr VINER,Th e basic reason that we have,23
NA,the present unemployment problem is because of,23
NA,the economic pohcies pursued by the Whitlam,23
NA,Administration in the years 1974 to 1975.,23
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,23
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Minister will re-,23
NA,sume his seat. I ask honourable members to re-,23
NA,main silent while the Minister is answering the,23
Mr VINER,M y simple statement brought,23
NA,raucous laughter from the Opposition. I wonder,23
NA,these statistics will bring forth from Oppo-,23
NA,sition members. Between May 1974 and May,23
NA,1975 under the Whitlam Labor Government full,23
NA,"this time unemployment increased by 138,700.",23
Mr HOWE ,Yo u have had four years.,23
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,23
NA,for member for Batman asked a question. The Min-,23
NA,is ister is now answering it. I suggest that the,23
NA,honourable member for Batman remain silent,23
NA,the while the answer is being given.,23
Mr VINER,"During that period, May 1974 to",23
NA,"May 1975, civUian employment decreased by",23
NA,It decreased because private employ-,23
NA,"ment, that is, employment in the private sector,",23
NA,"is decreased by a massive 155,000. That simply",23
NA,by means that in one year under the Whitlam,23
NA,"Administration 155,000 jobs were destroyed as a",23
NA,result of the economic policies ofthe day. During,23
NA,and the that same period government employment,23
NA,"increased by nearly 100,000. In simple economic",23
NA,"terms, that means that 155,000 jobs, which",23
NA,"at no cost to the taxpayer, were replaced",23
NA,"by 100,000 jobs which were financed by the",23
NA,Is there any reason not to understand that the,24
NA,Labor Party policies of today under the Leader,24
NA,"of the Opposition, like those of the Whidam",24
NA,"Administration, must depend upon high taxes,",24
NA,whereas our economic policies are dependent,24
NA,upon creating the condiuons whereby we will get,24
NA,"economic growth in the private sector and,",24
NA,"through the private sector, real jobs that will be",24
NA,of lasting benefit to the community? The effec-,24
NA,tiveness of our policies is shown by the fact that,24
NA,"over the last 12 months 64,400 additional jobs",24
NA,"have been created in the work force, the bulk of",24
NA,"which are in the private sector. This, we know, is",24
NA,where we will get increasing employment,24
NA,growth.,24
NA,The other factor is that Australia came late,24
NA,into an era of high youth unemployment conse-,24
NA,quent upon economic policies the results of,24
NA,which appeared from 1974 to 1975. What we,24
NA,"have done as a government, since we came into",24
NA,"office in late 1975, is to embark upon a massive",24
NA,expansion of our manpower and training,24
NA,programs. Since we have come into office we,24
NA,have invested over $400m in these programs,24
NA,"which has assisted over 400,000 young and old",24
NA,"Australians. This financial year, we will be",24
NA,mvesting $ 132.2m in our manpower and training,24
NA,"programs which will assist 210,000 people. In",24
NA,our National Employment and Training Scheme,24
NA,"the number supported will be 31,000; in the",24
NA,"Education Program for Unemployed Youth,",24
NA,"5,000; in the Special Youth Employment Train-",24
NA,"ing Program, 49,000; in our Commonwealth Re-",24
NA,"bate for Apprentice Full-time Training Program,",24
NA,"85,000; and in our Community Youth Support",24
NA,"Scheme Programs, 40,000-a total of 210,000",24
NA,Australians supported by government money,24
NA,which we are prepared to invest in their future.,24
NA,TAXATION: INDEPENDENT ADVISORY,24
NA,COMMITTEE,24
Mr SHACK,In the past the Treasurer has,24
NA,expressed himself broadly in favour of an,24
NA,independent advisory committee on taxation in,24
NA,line with the Asprey Review Committee rec-,24
NA,ommendation. Is the Treasurer able to inform,24
NA,the House whether he has further considered this,24
NA,proposal?,24
Mr HOWARD,"I t is true, as the honourable",24
NA,"member for Tangney says, that I have com-",24
NA,mented favourably on a recommendation of the,24
NA,Asprey report that an independent advisory,24
NA,committee on taxation be established. I can tell,24
NA,the honourable member and the House that the,24
NA,Government has approved a recommendation of,24
NA,mine that such a committee be established. I be-,24
NA,lieve that it will make a valuable contribution to,24
NA,the advice on taxadon matters currently coming,24
NA,to the Government. The committee will comp-,24
NA,lement that advice and not compete with it.,24
NA,I am presently giving consideration to the per-,24
NA,sonnel who might be invited to serve on the com-,24
NA,mittee and who might be interested in serving on,24
NA,"the committee, and I have sought the views of a",24
NA,number of professional and other organisations,24
NA,as to suitable people. I hope within a matter of a,24
NA,few weeks to be able to announce both the per-,24
NA,sonnel of the committee and the precise terms of,24
NA,reference of the committee. I see this particular,24
NA,"committee as playing a very valuable role, par-",24
NA,ticularly in terms of giving alternative technical,24
NA,advice to the Government on what is undoubt-,24
NA,edly an act of this Parliament of continuing rel-,24
NA,evance to everybody.,24
NA,EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING,24
NA,PROGRAMS,24
Mr INNES ,I ask the Minister for,24
NA,Employment and Youth Affairs: Is it a fact that,24
NA,by January 1980 only four out of every 100,24
NA,officially registered unemployed people will re-,24
NA,ceive training assistance? Is it a fact that last,24
NA,August the comparable figure was 13 out of,24
NA,every 100? Is it also a fact that the expenditure of,24
NA,$140m on the National Employment and Train-,24
NA,"ing System, the Community Youth Suppon",24
NA,"Scheme, the Commonwealth Rebate for Ap-",24
NA,prentice Full-time Training scheme and the Edu-,24
NA,cation Program for Unemployed Youth rep-,24
NA,resents 0.12 per cent of the gross national,24
NA,"product, while Canada and the United States of",24
NA,America spend six times that amount and,24
NA,Sweden spends 20timesthat amount? Why are,24
NA,all the other member countries of the Organis-,24
NA,ation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-,24
NA,ment out of step with Australia?,24
Mr VINER,I f the honourable gentleman,24
NA,gives me more particulars ofthe statistics that he,24
NA,"produces from other countries, I will take his",24
NA,question on notice and give him a detailed,24
NA,answer.,24
NA,HOME BUILDING COSTS,24
Mr BRADFIELD,I s the Mimster for Hous-,24
NA,ing and Construction aware of recent statistics,24
NA,and Press reports which indicate that home,24
NA,"building costs have risen, particularly in the",24
NA,months of July and August of this year? Could,24
NA,the Minister identify the base causes of these,24
NA,rises? Could he also indicate whether these in-,24
NA,creases mean that homes will become more,24
NA,difficult for home buyers to obtain in the future?,24
Mr GROOM, I am pleased that the honour-,24
NA,able member for Barton has raised this subject.,24
NA,Earlier this week the Austrahan Bureau of Stat-,25
NA,istics released its figures on increases in home,25
NA,building material prices in Australia. The figures,25
NA,show that in the month of August an increase of,25
NA,1.4 per cent occurred. This compares with an in-,25
NA,"crease in the month of July of 1.3 per cent. So,",25
NA,there was a slight increase of 0.1 per cent over,25
NA,previous month'sfigure.It is true that the figures,25
NA,for the last couple of months were higher than,25
NA,thefiguresfor a number of previous months. The,25
NA,increase has been influenced by higher prices for,25
NA,"clay bricks, for timber-both hardwood and",25
NA,softwood-an d for steel and cement products.,25
NA,The honourable member asks why the increases,25
NA,have occurred. It is always difficult to pinpoint,25
NA,reasons for increases of these kinds in these sorts,25
NA,of indices. The figures for several months were,25
NA,extremely low and eventually it was obvious that,25
NA,some upward readjustment would occur. That,25
NA,"has been a factor in the latest increases. Also, we",25
NA,have seen increases in petroleum and chemical,25
NA,prices which obviously feed through eventually,25
NA,to building material costs.,25
NA,Despite the moderate increases which have,25
NA,"taken place in the last two months, the Govern-",25
NA,ment certainly has a very good record in contain-,25
NA,ing costs in the building sector. The house build-,25
NA,ing materials index has declined in each of the,25
NA,years that this Government has been in office. I,25
NA,think that that is a very significant achievement,25
NA,indeed. As all honourable members on both,25
NA,"sides of the House will know, by comparison,",25
NA,costs of all kinds soared during the period of the,25
NA,"Labor Administradon, and that included build-",25
NA,ing costs. I give an example: In the year ending,25
NA,July 1979 this Government achieved afigureof,25
NA,9.6 per cent and this compares with a Labor,25
NA,figure of 22.9 per cent in the 12-month period to,25
NA,the end of January 1975. For the latest 12-month,25
NA,"period, including August, the figure is 10.5 per",25
NA,cent. This Government is now achieving inflauon,25
NA,"figures about half, or less than half, of what",25
NA,were during the period for which the Labor,25
NA,Government was in office. For non-residential,25
NA,"building material costs, thefigurefor August was",25
NA,1.2 per cent. When the present Opposition was in,25
NA,government we sawfigurestwo and three times,25
NA,that percentage. If we look back to April 1974 we,25
NA,"see afigurefor one month of 4.1 per cent, com-",25
NA,pared with 1.2 per cent for August 1979. We saw,25
NA,a yearly increase of 26 per cent at about that,25
NA,time. Thefiguresduring that period were very,25
NA,high indeed.,25
NA,It is not possible to assess accurately the,25
NA,flow-on effect on the cost of new houses resulting,25
NA,"from these price increases, but one point that",25
NA,must be made is that the housing industry de-,25
NA,serves great credit for the way in which it has,25
NA,kept prices down and absorbed cost increases,25
NA,over the past few years. In the whole of the,25
NA,1978-79financialyear the new house price in-,25
NA,crease for the consumer price index was only 3,25
NA,the per cent. That was a significant achievement and,25
NA,much credit must go to the home building indus-,25
NA,try for achieving that amazing result. It has,25
NA,meant that new homes have become much more,25
NA,competitive in price. Although we are concerned,25
NA,about the latest cost increases and the upward,25
NA,"movement in the last couple of months, our",25
NA,record in government is very good indeed and I,25
NA,expect that Australia will continue to do very,25
NA,much better than other comparable countries.,25
Mr SPEAKER,I suggest that the Minister,25
NA,wind up his answer.,25
Mr GROOM,"I am just about to, Mr Speaker.",25
NA,We will certainly continue to be very much more,25
NA,successful than the Australian Labor Party was,25
NA,when it was in office.,25
NA,UNEMPLOYMENT: MIGRANT INTAKE,25
Mr JOHN BROWN,I ask the Minister for,25
NA,Employment and Youth Affairs: Is it a fact that,25
NA,June labour force figures standardised by age,25
NA,give an unemployment rate of 7.7 per cent for the,25
NA,overseas-bora work force compared with 5.6 per,25
NA,cent for the Australian-born work force? Why,25
NA,has the Government decided to boost the intake,25
NA,of unskilled migrant workers when already 88,25
NA,unskilled manual workers are unemployed for,25
NA,every job vacancy and 24 semi-skilled workers,25
NA,are unemployed for every job vacancy? Is it,25
NA,therefore a fact that the majority of the increased,25
NA,unskilled migrant intake will join the dole,25
NA,queues?,25
Mr VINER,"Th e answer is no. Many, i f not",25
NA,"all, of the unskilled migrants who are coming to",25
NA,Australia are very hard working migrants and,25
NA,they make a great contribution to Australia both,25
NA,socially and economically. I know that my col-,25
NA,league the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic,25
NA,"Affairs, in the administration of the numerical",25
NA,multifactor assessment system of determining el-,25
NA,"igibility for permanent entry into Australia, takes",25
NA,fully into account the occupational needs of,25
NA,industry in Australia as one of the basic factors of,25
NA,the NUMAS scheme. I do not think there is any-,25
NA,body on this side of the House who would decry,25
NA,the value of migrants to Australia historically,25
NA,and the value of those who are seeking to come,25
NA,here now. We know migrants have made a great,25
NA,contribution to Australia. Even though we have,25
NA,"high levels of unemployment in Australia, mi-",25
NA,grants are welcome to this country. We do not,25
NA,believe that we should restrict unduly the mi-,26
NA,grant intake simply because we have high unem-,26
NA,"ployment levels. Quite properly, we must take",26
NA,into account the position in the areas in which,26
NA,there are shortages of skills and shortages of,26
NA,available people with special characteristics and,26
NA,"attributes. But overall, as a government, we be-",26
NA,lieve that there is plenty of room in Australia for,26
NA,the migrant intake level which we have estab-,26
NA,lished for this year.,26
NA,DONATIONS TO MEMORIAL TRUSTS:,26
NA,TAX DEDUCTIBILITY,26
Mr BARRY JONES, I direct my question to,26
NA,the Treasurer. Did the trustees of the H. V.,26
NA,Memorial Trust apply to the Treasury to allow,26
NA,tax deductibility for donations on the same basis,26
NA,as they are available for donations to the R.,26
NA,Menzies Memorial Trust? Has a reply been try,26
NA,"given? If not, why not? Will the Treasurer give",26
NA,an undertaking that the Evatt Trust will be dealt,26
NA,with in the same way as the Menzies Trust?,26
Mr HOWARD,Th e answer to the honourJune,26
NA,able gentleman's question is yes. I first saw a,26
NA,"ter last night, I think from a firm of solicitors",26
NA,"behalf of the trustees, but I was previously aware",26
NA,of an approach and I can tell the honourable,26
NA,gentleman that the matter is currently being,26
NA,considered.,26
NA,LOW ALCOHOL BEER,26
Mr BIRNEY, I ask the Minister for Health:,26
NA,"view of the estimated 3,500 deaths",26
NA,"in 1977 attributable to alcohol, does he support",26
NA,the recent introduction of low alcohol beer into,26
NA,New South Wales?,26
Mr HUNT, I have seen reports that a certain,26
NA,brewery in New South Wales has produced a of,26
NA,low alcohol content beer. I have not had the,26
NA,portunity to sample the brew but I am sure it,26
NA,be a popular drop. I congratulate the brewery,26
NA,concerned in New South Wales for responding,26
NA,a Senate committee under the chairmanship of,26
NA,Senator Peter Baume which recommended that,26
NA,low alcohol content beers should be available,26
NA,Australia. The Committee's report entitled,26
NA,'Drug Problems in Australia-a n intoxicated,26
NA,ciety?' is currently under consideration by the,26
NA,Government. I think it is fair to assume that,26
NA,there is a widespread development in the contion,26
NA,sumption of low alcohol content beers it could,26
NA,well reduce the incidence of road accidents,26
NA,also have a very big influence on reducing the in-,26
NA,cidence of alcohol caused or related illnesses. thinking.,26
NA,Both my Department and I as Minister for,26
NA,Health welcome the introduction of low alcohol,26
NA,content beers in Australia. I,26
NA,for Transport is having a little giggle. He likes the,26
NA,"Carlton Light beer from Victoria, I think. I do",26
NA,commend the brewery for producing such a re-,26
NA,sponsible brew. I wish the brew every success,26
NA,and I hope it takes the place of high alcohol con-,26
NA,tent beers.,26
Mr SPEAKER,The message is clear.,26
NA,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE:,26
NA,UNEMPLOYMENT,26
Mr HAYDEN,I ask the Minister for,26
NA,Employment and Youth Affairs whether it is a,26
NA,fact that the Government spent approximately,26
NA,Evatt $800m in the three-year period concluded in,26
NA,June this year on the investment allowance? Is it,26
NA,a fact that the effect of the investment allowance,26
NA,G. is to replace employees in manufacturing indus-,26
NA,"with, for instance, capital equipment? Is that",26
NA,policy of the Government reflected by employ-,26
NA,ment in manufacturing industry which fell from,26
NA,a peak in mid-1974 to mid-1979 by some,26
NA,"200,000 jobs or 15 per cent? Is it a fact that at",26
NA,1974 the AustraUa and New Zealand Bank-,26
NA,leting Group Ltd index of factory production of 169,26
NA,"on was at about a peak and at May 1979, in spite of",26
NA,"a reduction of over 200,000 jobs in manufactur-",26
NA,"ing employment, it was still at a level of 169? Is",26
NA,this the magnificent contribution to job security,26
NA,in this country that the Minister has been talking,26
NA,"about, namely, policies of the investment allow-",26
NA,ance at a time of high and worsening unemploy-,26
NA,In ment designed to aggravate that problem in,26
NA,in Australia manufacturing industry?,26
Mr VINER,We know that the investment,26
NA,policies of this Government have been a very im-,26
NA,portant factor in increasing the competitiveness,26
NA,Australian industry through greater efficiency,26
NA,opbecause of modernisation of plant and equip-,26
NA,will ment. We know that the investment allowance,26
NA,and other special tax incentives that this Govern-,26
NA,"to ment has offered will for example, enable the",26
NA,great North West Shelf development to go ahead,26
NA,on a firm economic basis. We also know that the,26
NA,"in bulk of those 155,000 jobs that were destroyed",26
NA,between May 1974 and May 1975 by the,26
NA,soWhitlam Administration were in the manufac-,26
NA,turing sector of Australian industry. That oc-,26
NA,if curred for a number of reasons and I will men-,26
NA,two. One was the tariff policies of the,26
NA,Whitlam Administration with a 25 per cent,26
NA,and across the board tariff cut.,26
Mr HAYDEN ,"Oh , come on, that is Andrew's",26
Mr VINER,Th e second reason why those,26
NA,notice the Minister jobs were so-,26
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Minister will re-,27
NA,sume his seat.,27
Mr HAYDEN ,The y have a policy for every,27
NA,occasion and every minute.,27
Mr SPEAKER,The Leader ofthe Opposition,27
NA,will remain silent. I ask all honourable members,27
NA,to remain silent while the answer is being given,27
NA,by the Minister.,27
Mr VINER,The destruction of jobs in the,27
NA,manufacturing sector of the magnitude that I,27
NA,have indicated can be brought home to two,27
NA,"things: Firstly, the tariff policies of the Whitlam",27
NA,"Administration, particularly the 25 per cent",27
NA,"across the board tariff cut; and, secondly, the",27
NA,wages policy of the administradon of the day,27
NA,which allowed wages to explode by about 40 per,27
NA,"cent. The Leader of the Opposition, the last",27
NA,"Labor Treasurer, knew that no economy could",27
NA,absorb a wages explosion of that kind. Yet at the,27
NA,Australian Labor Party Conference in Adelaide,27
NA,he was prepared to go along with the left wing of,27
NA,his party with a wages pohcy which will produce,27
NA,the same result.,27
Mr SPEAKER,I ask the Minister to keep his,27
NA,answer relevant to the question asked.,27
Mr VINER,W e know that the wages policy,27
NA,that the Australian Council of Trade Unions,27
NA,Congress has just announced,27
NA,same result. I gave a figure earlier in Question,27
NA,"Time of 64,400 civilian jobs, the bulk of which",27
NA,"are in the private sector, which were created",27
NA,tween May 1978 and May 1979 as a result of our,27
NA,economic policies. As a result of the incentives,27
NA,"that we give to manufacturing industry, particucerned",27
NA,"larly the export incentives, employment in the",27
NA,"manufacturing sector has increased by 13,100",27
NA,"people. Therefore, I have no hesitation in",27
NA,to this House that our policies will create jobs,27
NA,the manufacturing sector in contrast to the polithat,27
NA,cies of the Labor Adrninistration which deinitial,27
NA,stroyed jobs.,27
NA,AID TO KAMPUCHEA,27
Mr BURNS, I direct a question to the Ministhe,27
NA,ter for Foreign Affairs. I refer to his announceBangkok,27
NA,ment in the House on 12 September of the mount,27
NA,"Government's decision to provide 3,500 tonnes",27
NA,of rice for humanitarian relief in Kampuchea,27
NA,and reports in the Press that political obstacles,27
NA,are preventing the distribution of food and,27
NA,cal supplies to those threatened by disease and,27
NA,famine in that country. Can the Minister assure,27
NA,the House that no poUtical strings are attached,27
NA,Australia's humanitarian aid to Kampuchea?,27
NA,Will he provide assurances that every possible,27
NA,effort is being made to distribute,27
NA,to the people of Kampuchea as quickly as,27
NA,possible?,27
NA,NA,27
NA,able member's reference to the announcement,27
NA,last week of the Government's decision to pro-,27
NA,"vide 3,500 tonnes of rice for humanitarian reUef",27
NA,in Kampuchea. What is not known is that the,27
NA,"world food program asked for 2,000 tonnes",27
NA,towards their integrated program. The Govern-,27
NA,"ment believed that it should do more and, conse-",27
NA,"quently, an additional 1,500 tonnes will be made",27
NA,avaUable as a first response. The problems in,27
NA,mounting a large scale relief operation in Kam-,27
NA,puchea are obviously enormous. The country has,27
NA,been devastated and the almost total absence of,27
NA,"an administrative infrastructure, including com-",27
NA,"munications and transport faculties, makes it ex-",27
NA,tremely difficult to set up a major reUef program,27
NA,in a short period. The international reUef agen-,27
NA,cies are doing a marvellous job. They are being,27
NA,well supported by voluntary organisations in,27
NA,AustraUa which are now seeking an appeal from,27
NA,Australians through the AustraUan Council for,27
NA,Overseas Aid. The International Red Cross and,27
NA,the United Nations International Children's,27
NA,Emergency Fund have been negotiating with,27
NA,Kampuchean authorities over the past weeks on,27
NA,the methods and conditions for a large scale re-,27
NA,will lead to the lief operation.,27
NA,"Unquestionably, international channels are",27
NA,bethe best approach for effectively distributing,27
NA,suppUes to those in greatest need throughout the,27
NA,country. The Government has become con-,27
NA,with the delay in getting the administrat-,27
NA,"ive framework into place. As a consequence, we",27
NA,have been holding discussions with the Thai,27
NA,saying Government to commence the delivery of,27
NA,in supplies across the border with the assistance of,27
NA,Government. I have decided that part of the,27
NA,"rice contribution of3,500 tonnes should be",27
NA,used immediately to replace rice obtained,27
NA,locally. It is to be distributed to approximately,27
NA,"100,000 starving people in the area adjacent to",27
NA,Thai border. The Australian Embassy in,27
NA,has been actively involved in efforts to,27
NA,this relief program. The Australian contri-,27
NA,bution wUl be among the first to reach Kam-,27
NA,puchea. This operation wUl be one of the first,27
NA,practical steps towards what will need to be a,27
NA,medimuch larger and comprehensive operation in,27
NA,seeking to aUeviate the acute suffering of Khmer,27
NA,civilians in Kampuchea. I can assure the House,27
NA,to that not only is the Australian Government,27
NA,"deeply concerned, but it is also acting ex-",27
NA,peditiously. I can only trust that other nations,27
NA,AustraUa's aid will follow our lead.,27
NA,DRUG SMUGGLING,28
Mr CLYDE CAMERON, I direct my ques-,28
NA,tion to the Minister for Immigration. By way of,28
NA,"preface, I should like to inform the House that",28
NA,"when I was Minister for Immigration, infor-",28
NA,mation came to me and to my Department that,28
NA,heroin smuggled into AustraUa came principally,28
NA,via New Zealand. People were using the Tasman,28
NA,"route, pretending to be New Zealanders-som e",28
NA,were New Zealanders-an d they were getting,28
NA,into AustraUa without being subject to control or,28
NA,checking. I can also say by way of preface-,28
Mr SPEAKER, I think the honourable,28
NA,gentleman ought to ask his question.,28
Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Yes. It is about sideration,28
NA,heroin. It is an important matter. The two Minismember.,28
NA,ters concerned reached tacit agreement on the,28
NA,troduction of a system of control by which everyand me.,28
NA,"body crossing the Tasman, in either direction",28
NA,would be required to identify themselves so that,28
NA,proper and effective control over the smuggling,28
NA,of heroin could be brought about.,28
Mr SPEAKER,No w the quesuon.,28
Mr CLYDE CAMERON, I pubUcly give my,28
NA,permission to the Minister to search through all,28
NA,myfiles-everything that passed over my desk-,28
NA,and to disregard the convention saying that a,28
NA,"Minister must not look at his predecessors docuindustry,",28
NA,ments. I now ask the Mimster whether he has,28
NA,"turned his mind to introducing, as I had intended",28
NA,"to do, a system of identity control, either by way",28
NA,of passport and visas or by way of identification,28
NA,"card, to prevent in some way the trafficking in",28
NA,heroin that we now know takes place mainly via,28
NA,New Zealand and the Tasman route?,28
Mr MACKELLAR,Naturall y I know of the tender.,28
NA,honourable gentleman's continuing concern,28
NA,"relation to this matter, and I share it. Movement",28
NA,across the Tasman is of a considerable scale each,28
NA,way every year. There is a special relationship,28
NA,between AustraUa and New Zealand which I am,28
NA,anxious to preserve. I think the common histories,28
NA,ofthe two countries is of importance. I would,28
NA,Uke to bring about a situation which would,28
NA,necessarily hinder the free movement of people,28
NA,who are eUgible to travel between the two counLtd,28
NA,"tries. Having said that, I am concerned not",28
NA,about the possibilities of heroin smuggling but,28
NA,also the possibilities of the free entry anangeof,28
NA,ments being used by other than New Zealand the,28
NA,citizens or British subjects who are eligible to,28
NA,"them. To this end, over a period of time now, I",28
NA,have been having negotiations with my New,28
NA,Zealand counterpart. These negotiations have,28
NA,progressed very satisfactorily.,28
NA,Meetings of State Ministers associated with,28
NA,immigration and myself are held regularly under,28
NA,this Government and they now include the New,28
NA,Zealand Minister for Immigration. At these,28
NA,meetings the question of trans-Tasman move-,28
NA,"ment has been brought up. Recently, a senior",28
NA,officer of my Depanment was in New Zealand,28
NA,for discussions with New Zealand depanmental,28
NA,officials and the current Minister for Immigration,28
NA,in New Zealand. We are anxious to bring about,28
NA,a situation in which abuses of the arrangement,28
NA,can be minimised. I would like to see in existence,28
NA,an arrangement whereby the total immigration,28
NA,procedures of the two countries are brought as,28
NA,far as possible into harmony. I take into con-,28
NA,the matters raised by the honourable,28
NA,They are under active investigation at,28
NA,inpresent by both the New Zealand Government,28
NA,PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL,28
Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,Th e Minister for,28
NA,National Development would be aware of the,28
NA,"trend in other countries, particularly the United",28
NA,"States of America, towards the production of",28
NA,ethanol fuel on the farm for that farm's use. Be-,28
NA,cause of an interest in AustraUa in the production,28
NA,"of simUar on-rfarm fuel, particularly in the sugar",28
NA,would the Minister recommend to the,28
NA,Government the exemption from excise duties of,28
NA,farm produced fuel in order to encourage its pro-,28
NA,duction by decreasing its cost?,28
Mr NEWMAN,The Government has a pol-,28
NA,icy of encouraging the use of ethanol as a fuel ex-,28
NA,"For that reason, as part of our research",28
NA,"in and demonstration program, we have placed",28
NA,particular emphasis on research concerning etha-,28
NA,nol. I think the amount currently being expended,28
NA,on that program is about $ 1.5m. That has meant,28
NA,that we have encouraged research into a great,28
NA,variety of feed stocks ranging from sugar cane,28
NA,not and cassava in Queensland to sugar beet in Tas-,28
NA,unmania. I am very pleased that recently Ampol,28
NA,Petroleum Ltd and Biotechnology AustraUa Pty,28
NA,announced that they will start a pilot plant in,28
NA,"only Sydney which, it is claimed, could provide",28
NA,Australia leadership in continuous fermentation,28
NA,feed stocks for ethanol. I just wanted to make,28
NA,"point, first of all, that we are very keen to pro-",28
NA,use mote ethanol as the extender. I beUeve that our,28
NA,"work is now starting to show results, particularly",28
NA,as we have commercial interests taking steps to,28
NA,start such important pUot programs as that which,28
NA,I have just mentioned.,28
NA,The honourable member's question referred,29
NA,to a particular problem involving farm units pro-,29
NA,ducing ethanol in farm installations. The Minis-,29
NA,ter for Business and Consumer Affairs and I are,29
NA,very conscious of some of the problems that exist,29
NA,both in licensing and in excise arrangements for,29
NA,farm operators who might choose to install their,29
NA,own home ethanol production units. We have,29
NA,this matter under close scrutiny and I hope that,29
NA,"very soon, after the Government has had the",29
NA,"chance to consider our recommendations, we",29
NA,will be in a position to make an announcement.,29
NA,MAJOR AIRPORT NEEDS OF SYDNEY,29
Mr LES JOHNSON,"My question, which is",29
NA,"directed to the Minister for Transport, refers to",29
NA,the Major Airport Needs of Sydney study. Has,29
NA,the delay in bringing down a report caused wide-,29
NA,"spread concern in many electorates, such as Bar-",29
NA,"ton, Hughes, Kingsford-Smith, Grayndler and St",29
NA,George? Are many people concerned that prop-,29
NA,erty values have been adversely affected? Will,29
NA,the failure to resolve this matter greatly increase,29
NA,the cost to the Australian taxpayer of providing,29
NA,an additional airport? Is any end in sight to this,29
NA,"scandalous delay? If so, when-",29
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,29
NA,gentleman is not entitled to,29
NA,tions words of that kind.,29
Mr LES JOHNSON,Has the Minister any,29
NA,idea whether this report will ever be completed?,29
NA,Can he say when it is likely to be tabled in this,29
NA,Parliament?,29
Mr NIXON, I welcome this question. The,29
NA,fact is that I have written to the Minister for,29
NA,"Plarining and Environment in New South Wales,",29
NA,who has equal responsibility with me for the re-,29
NA,port of the Major Airport Needs of Sydney,29
NA,"study, inforrning him that I think 14 December is",29
NA,an appropriate date for the study to report to,29
NA,both the New South Wales Minister and me.,29
Mr YOUNG ,Afte r the election?,29
Mr NIXON,The date suggested is 14,29
NA,December 1979.,29
Mr YOUNG ,Afte r the election.,29
Mr NIXON,"W e are clever today, are we not?",29
NA,The fact is that the MANS study has been very,29
NA,thorough both in its activities and its public,29
NA,ticipation and is studying all the questons rel-,29
NA,evant to coming to a decision about and a con-,29
NA,clusion as to what will be the future airport,29
NA,of Sydney. I look forward to receiving the report,29
NA,on 14 December. I also look forward to consul-,29
NA,"tations with my colleague, the New South Wales",29
NA,"Minister for Planning and Environment, Mr",29
NA,"Landa, so that the two Governments can settle",29
NA,down and rationally provide a proper solution to,29
NA,take away all of the concerns of the people of,29
NA,Sydney-tha t is those who might be affected by,29
NA,any changes-an d also to get a proper develop-,29
NA,ment so that the future needs of Sydney are prop-,29
NA,erly planned. I hope that the honourable,29
NA,member who is taking an interest in this matter,29
NA,will also encourage his State colleagues-bein g in,29
NA,the same political party-t o settle down at the,29
NA,table so that we can get this matter resolved once,29
NA,and for all and we will not dillydally any further.,29
NA,AIR POLLUTION,29
Mr CADMAN,I s the Minister for Transport,29
NA,aware that despite the obvious advantages of,29
NA,liquefied petroleum gas and diesel fuel in con-,29
NA,tributing to the quality of air in the inner city,29
NA,"areas, and in particular in the City of Sydney,",29
NA,that the New South Wales Government on 27,29
NA,July gazetted a regulation under the Clean Air,29
NA,Act 1961 that requires motor vehicle manufac-,29
NA,"turers to proceed to the costly, and in the case of",29
NA,"pollution control, unsatisfactory implementation",29
NA,of phase 3 of Australian Design Rule 27A? Fur-,29
NA,"thermore, will the Minister inform the House of",29
NA,the approximate number of State Government,29
NA,vehicles at present utilising the cleaner fuel LPG,29
NA,import into his ques- or diesel?,29
Mr NIXON,I shall take the last part of the,29
NA,"honourable member's question first. No, I am",29
NA,unable to give him that information. I will see i f i,29
NA,can obtain it from the New South Wales Govern-,29
NA,ment and provide it for him. It is a fact that the,29
NA,New South Wales Government has passed regu-,29
NA,lations to gazette something equivalent to the,29
NA,third stage of Australian Design Rule 27A. This,29
NA,will have the effect of increasing the fuel con-,29
NA,sumption of motor cars by up to 5 per cent.,29
NA,"Indeed, it is quite regrettable that the New South",29
NA,Wales Government has gone against the rec-,29
NA,ommendation accepted by the majority of the,29
NA,States in the Commonwealth at the last Aus-,29
NA,tralian Transport Advisory Council meeting on,29
NA,"this matter. I am convinced, as are other State",29
NA,"Ministers for Transport, that there are more cost",29
NA,effective ways of improving the current pollution,29
NA,control situation. These include more stringent,29
NA,parevaporative hydrocarbon controls at minimal,29
NA,"cost. Also they provide an energy saving, over-",29
NA,coming in-service problems with present vehicles,29
NA,needs to improve emission and fuel performance with,29
NA,proper attention to other sources of hydro-,29
NA,carbons. I think New South Wales has made a,29
NA,serious mistake in implementing these regu-,29
NA,lations. It will be a costly mistake in terms of fuel,29
NA,consumption.,29
NA,The previous South Australian Government,30
NA,unfortunately followed the party line taken by,30
NA,New South Wales in this matter. I am hopeful,30
NA,that as a result of discussions with the new Minis-,30
NA,"ter for Transport, he might be able to convince",30
NA,his Government of the wisdom of moving back,30
NA,from the position adopted by his predecessor. I,30
NA,look forward to those discussions at an early date,30
NA,because I think the new South Australian,30
NA,government will take a more flexible attitude,30
NA,when compared with the dogmatic approach,30
NA,taken by the previous Administration. The,30
NA,interesting thing about Sydney is that I am,30
NA,informed that there was a marginal improve-,30
NA,ment in the air quality between 1976 and 1977.,30
NA,This information comes as a result of monitoring,30
NA,"the air quality of Sydney. Therefore, it seems to",30
NA,me that New South Wales is quite unwise to im-,30
NA,pose this further cost on the motor car user when,30
NA,such doubtful benefits-i f any at all-ar e to be,30
NA,gained by its action.,30

NA,TAX DEDUCTIBILITY,30
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,(Wannon-,30
NA,"Prime Minister)-Wit h your indulgence, Mr",30
NA,"Speaker, could I add to a question that was",30
NA,answered by my colleague the Treasurer ( Mr,30
NA,Howard) about the Evatt Trust?,30
Mr SPEAKER,Therighthonourable gentle-,30
NA,man may proceed.,30
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,I was ap-,30
NA,proached earlier in this year and in response to,30
NA,that initial approach a letter rejecting the appli-,30
NA,cation was given. Then Mr Wran wrote to me a,30
NA,short while ago and I discussed this matter with,30
NA,some of my colleagues. The matter is being re-,30
NA,examined as the Treasurer indicated. I am,30
NA,advised that some of the purposes of the Trust,30
NA,have very particular Labor Party associations.,30
NA,That was not included in the initial letter to me or,30
NA,in Mr Wran's letter to me. I have asked my De-,30
NA,partment to conduct an examination to see,30
NA,exactly what the purposes and objectives of this,30
NA,"Trust are. I should also note, of course, that in the",30
NA,"terms of memorials to significant Australians, the",30
NA,John Curtin School of Medical Research does,30
NA,commemorate a very great Australian Prime,30
NA,Minister. We believe that the Menzies Trust will,30
NA,commemorate another great Australian Prime,30
NA,Minister for purely national purposes. Whether,30
NA,that practice should extend to other significant,30
NA,Australians who have been members of this Par-,30
NA,liament is a matter for consideration.,30

NA,Report and Ministerial Statement,31
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,Wannon-Prime these,31
NA,Minister)- I had intended to table the report,31
NA,the Committee on Official Establishments and,31
NA,"ask leave to make a short statement about it, but",31
NA,I understand that a copy of that statement might,31
NA,have reached the Leader ofthe Opposition ( Mr,31
NA,Hayden) only 10 minutes ago. I would be happy,31
NA,to defer my statement.,31
Mr HAYDEN ,I t is okay.,31
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"I n that case, for",31
NA,the information of honourable members I and,31
NA,present the final report of the Committee on time to come.,31
NA,Official Establishments and seek leave to make a,31
NA,short statement on that report.,31
NA,Leave granted.,31
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Honourable require,31
NA,members may recall that the interim report of,31
NA,the Committee was tabled in May 1977. This,31
NA,independent committee was appointed by the,31
NA,Government in September 1976 to advise on the lition,31
NA,"operation, conservation and longer term develstables.",31
NA,opment of the four official residences of the posal,31
NA,Commonwealth Government-Governmen t vided,31
NA,House and the Lodge in Canberra and Admirvolve,31
NA,alty House and Kirribilli House in Sydney. The,31
NA,Chairman of the Committee was Mr Andrew it,31
NA,Grimwade. Its other members were Mr Guilford,31
NA,"Bell, Dame Helen Blaxland, the Honourable",31
NA,"James Cope, and Mrs Ruth Gullett. I wish",31
NA,thank Mr Grimwade and all the members of the,31
NA,"Committee for their work which had involved,",31
NA,"I know, a considerable sacrifice of their time.",31
NA,The four establishments are official residences,31
NA,serving the ongoing needs of government. The,31
NA,buildings have already been declared part of,31
NA,National Estate and are well worthwhile,31
NA,preserving as symbolic items in our country's his-,31
NA,tory and cultural heritage. Already these four,31
NA,residences contain significant items,31
NA,tralian which includes pieces of early Australian,31
NA,"furniture and works of art. For example, a short",31
NA,"while ago a notable portrait of Mr Watson, the",31
NA,"first Australian Labor Party Prime Minister,",31
NA,came into the possession of the Australiana Fund,31
NA,and that now hangs in the Lodge. The report recits,31
NA,ommends that there be continuing machinery in,31
NA,the form of a permanent advisory trust to be,31
NA,sponsible for advice to the Government on the,31
NA,"conservation, development and efficient operpleased",31
NA,ation of the buildings and grounds of the official,31
NA,establishments. The Government agrees that,31
NA,such continuing machinery is necessary and,31
NA,establishing a permanent body to be known as,31
NA,the Official Establishments Trust.,31
NA,Most of the other recommendations of the,31
NA,Committee have been accepted. Included in,31
NA,is the proposal that the Trust evaluate,31
NA,of which of two sites is the more appropriate for a,31
NA,possible new Prime Ministerial residence which,31
NA,one day may be necessary. So that the second site,31
NA,"may be released for other purposes, the Govern-",31
NA,ment has asked the new Trust to advise as soon,31
NA,as possible which of the two sites is the more sui-,31
NA,table. I emphasise that no decision has been,31
NA,taken to build a new Prime Ministerial residence.,31
NA,The present Lodge is serving its function well,31
NA,is expected to continue to do so for a long,31
NA,A few of the Committee's recommendations,31
NA,will be referred to the permanent body for,31
NA,further consideration. These cover suggested,31
NA,working arrangements in the financial area and,31
NA,further consideration before decisions,31
NA,are reached. The Government has decided not to,31
NA,accept recommendations that future planning for,31
NA,Government House be based on eventual demo-,31
NA,of existing structures other than the historic,31
NA,Nor does it accept at this time the pro-,31
NA,that official establishment facilities be pro-,31
NA,in Melbourne. Both proposals would in-,31
NA,expenditure outlay wliich the Government,31
NA,sees as inconsistent with the general restraint that,31
NA,is currently maintaining on its spending. Im-,31
NA,plementation of the recommendations accepted,31
NA,"will, of course, be subject to examination and",31
NA,to funds approval in the normal budgetary,31
NA,processes. I seek leave to table for the infor-,31
NA,as mation of honourable members a listing of those,31
NA,"recommendations accepted, those rejected and",31
NA,those to be referred to the new permanent body.,31
Mr SPEAKER,Is the right honourable,31
NA,the gentleman seeking to table the recommendations,31
NA,or to have them incorporated in Hansard?.,31
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,I do not mind. I,31
NA,of Austhink tabling would be adequate.,31
Mr SPEAKER,Leave is not required to table,31
NA,a document.,31
Mr MALCOLM FRASER,Onc e again I,31
NA,thank the Committee for its work. As a result of,31
NA,efforts the Government now has a firm basis,31
NA,on which to plan for the conservation and future,31
NA,"redevelopment of the official establishments, an",31
NA,important part of Australia's heritage. I am,31
NA,to be able to inform the House that Mr,31
NA,"Andrew Grimwade as Chairman, Mr Guilford",31

NA,Committee's inquiry into off-road vehicles. The,32
NA,Government has taken a number of initiatives as,32
NA,a consequence of recommendations arising from,32
NA,the mquiry into off-road vehicles. I would like to,32
NA,inform the House of these. This is in keeping with,32
NA,the Government's policy that Ministers should,32
NA,make a statement on action stemming from re-,32
NA,ports of parliamentary committees.,32
NA,The House of Representatives Standing Comvolved,32
NA,mittee on Environment and Conservation,32
NA,solved in September 1975 to inquire into the,32
NA,pact of off-road vehicles on the Australian,32
NA,environment. The Committee's report was,32
NA,tabled in the House in March 1977. The major,32
NA,"responsibility for managing off-road, or",32
NA,"reation, vehicles is vested in the State governimported.",32
NA,ments. Recommendations in this report refer,32
NA,"only to action by the Commonwealth, indepenand",32
NA,dently or in conjunction with the States and,32
NA,government and other bodies. The Government restrictions.,32
NA,has examined all recommendations and taken a,32
NA,number of actions as a result.,32
NA,But Government action can be effective only,32
NA,it is backed by community awareness and consearch,32
NA,cern. This is particularly true in the case of,32
NA,"reation vehicles, where the behaviour of individdamaged",32
NA,ual riders and drivers is critical to the protection,32
NA,"of the environment. Because of this, the Governnew",32
NA,ment has been especially concerned to imof,32
NA,plement the Committee's recommendations tralian,32
NA,aimed at promoting environmental awareness,32
NA,recreation vehicle users. One contribution to this,32
NA,has been a film produced by Film Australia for,32
NA,"the former Department of Environment,",32
NA,"ing and Community Development. The film, present",32
NA,"called 'Making Tracks', shows in a simple way",32
NA,the effects which vehicles can have on the bush,32
NA,and the beach. It has been made for showing to further,32
NA,"recreation vehicle clubs, schools, environment",32
NA,centres and all groups which have an interest,32
NA,recreation vehicles.,32
NA,Another activity undertaken by the former,32
NA,Department in this direction was the preparation,32
NA,of a code of ethics for recreation vehicle users.,32
NA,This code was discussed with recreation vehicle,32
NA,organisations and relevant State bodies as,32
NA,recommended by the Standing Committee. The,32
NA,code has been printed as a poster and as a sticker,32
NA,for doors and motorcycle fuel tanks and has been,32
NA,"distributed to recreation vehicle clubs, motor",32
NA,"registries, automobile associations, environment",32
NA,centres and other relevant bodies.,32
NA,The Standing Committee also recommended,32
NA,that the Commonwealth encourage a national,32
NA,symposium on off-road vehicles. A national,32
NA,workshop on off-road vehicle management was,32
NA,held at the Canberra College of Advanced Edu-,32
NA,"cation last December, and was attended by rep-",32
NA,"resentatives from the Commonwealth, State and",32
NA,"local government, off-road vehicle clubs and",32
NA,environmentalists. The workshop aimed to bring,32
NA,"administrators, planners, managers, users of the",32
NA,recreation vehicles and others to a closer under-,32
NA,standing and appreciation of the problems in-,32
NA,in the use of recreation vehicles and the,32
NA,repotential environmental damage. Other rec-,32
NA,imommendations of the Committee were that the,32
NA,importation of over-snow recreation vehicles be,32
NA,prohibited and that an environmental impact,32
NA,assessment should be carried out before any new,32
NA,rectype of off-road recreational vehicle was,32
NA,The Government examined these rec-,32
NA,"ommendations, but considers that legislation",32
NA,controls on use after entry into Australia,32
NA,local would be far more effective than import,32
NA,A number of recommendations concerned de-,32
NA,fence training areas. In association with the,32
NA,if Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Re-,32
NA,"Organisation, the Defence Department is",32
NA,reccontinuing its program of regenerating areas,32
NA,by defence training activities. Environ-,32
NA,ment impact statements on the establishment of,32
NA,defence training areas include consideration,32
NA,the effects of vehicles on the terrain. The Aus-,32
NA,Capital Territory is one area in which the,32
NA,in Commonwealth has a direct concern in the regu-,32
NA,lation of recreation vehicles. The Department of,32
NA,the Capital Territory has examined carefully the,32
NA,HousStanding Commttee's recommendations. At,32
NA,the Department monitors the use of trail,32
NA,"and mini bikes, operates three bike tracks in the",32
NA,Australian Capital Territory and is looking at,32
NA,sites for these activities. It is also review-,32
NA,ing the need for a registration system for rec-,32
NA,"in reation vehicles. In the States, Victoria and",32
NA,Queensland already have legislation and other,32
NA,States and the Northern Territory are consider-,33
NA,ing legislation or other forms of control.,33
NA,The Standing Committee's report has,33
NA,drawn to the attention of members of the CounEnvironment,33
NA,"cil of Nature Conservation Ministers, the Auslater",33
NA,tralian Environment Council and the Recreation,33
NA,Ministers' Council. The Ministers concerned,33
NA,have agreed to discuss the recommendations,33
NA,"with other State colleagues. In this way, I hope",33
NA,that the report may influence the,33
NA,control legislation in States which do not have it.,33
NA,Through the ministerial councils we will follow,33
NA,these developments. ',33
NA,I would just like to add one further point.,33
NA,this statement the term 'recreation vehicle',33
NA,generally been adopted rather than the term,33
NA,'off-road vehicle' which was the term used in the,33
NA,report. The name 'recreation vehicle' is preferred,33
NA,to the term 'off-road vehicle' which I believe,33
NA,courages a use of vehicles which are intrinsically,33
NA,damaging to the environment. All vehicles,33
NA,should preferably be driven or ridden on some,33
NA,"kind of track. In conclusion, let me repeat",33
NA,the Government has considered the report and,33
NA,taken action as it believes necessary. I hope that recreationists-challengin,33
NA,recreation vehicle users will support government the,33
NA,activity in this field and take care to protect the over,33
NA,environment.,33
NA,I present the following paper,33
NA,Committee on Environment and Conservation: Report,33
NA,Off-Road Vehicles-Government's Response-Ministeria l,33
NA,"Statement, 20 September 1979.",33
NA,Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed:,33
NA,That the House take note ofthe paper.,33
Mr MORRIS ,Shortland) (11.38)-The Opirresponsible,33
NA,position welcomes the statement just made by,33
NA,the Minister for Housing and Construction ( Mr,33
NA,Groom). I am responding to the Minister's stateof,33
NA,"ment in the absence of my colleague, the honourwere",33
NA,"able member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen), beriders,",33
NA,cause he is attending a very important,33
NA,"conference at Wagga Wagga today. As I said,",33
NA,the Opposition welcomes the statement but its,33
NA,preparation has taken two and a half years. It,33
NA,2Vi years since the report of the House of Repusers.,33
NA,resentatives Standing Committee on Environ-,33
NA,ment and Conservation was tabled in the Parliaments,33
NA,ment. In essence the Government's response to,33
NA,the Committee's recommendations has been,33
NA,flimsy and deplorable. This nation has a serious,33
NA,problem. Clearly environmental responsibility,33
NA,has been the unwanted child of this Government.,33
NA,Honourable members will recall that with the,33
NA,change of Government in 1975 the environment,33
NA,ministry was abolished by the Fraser Govern-,33
NA,ment. It was absorbed into the odds and sods de-,33
NA,"partment, namely, the Department of Environ-",33
NA,"been ment, Housing and Community Development.",33
NA,was downgraded further still by,33
NA,becoming a division of the Department of,33
NA,Science. Now it comes within the Department of,33
NA,Science and the Environment. Let us be clear,33
NA,where this Government stands in relation to,33
NA,environment matters. Its priorities in that regard,33
NA,preparation of are very low indeed.,33
NA,Environmental management and the impact,33
NA,of off-road vehicles on the Australian continent,33
NA,are very serious problems. They are matters,33
NA,In which create problems for the environment itself.,33
NA,has The disturbance created by the use of off-road,33
NA,vehicles is a problem to communities. In this re-,33
NA,gard I refer to an article relating to the use of,33
NA,off-road vehicles published in the Sydney Morn-,33
NA,ening Herald as far back as April 1976. The article,33
NA,outlines the basic conflict between the use of,33
NA,off-road vehicles and the preservation of the,33
NA,environment and environmental qualities in,33
NA,that urban areas. The article states:,33
NA,The root problem is that the type of use desired by ORV,33
NA,g terrain-i s in direct conflict with,33
NA,soil conservation techniques that have been developed,33
NA,"the years. Despite their claims, the ORV enthusiasts",33
NA,have not succeeded in rewriting these rules in the way that,33
NA,"nature understands. The effects of soil loss are, in terms of",33
NA,"our lifetimes, permanent and negative.",33
NA,That is the basic conflict because these vehicles,33
NA,on are damaging and they are even more damaging,33
NA,when they are not used in a responsible way. We,33
NA,should note that in many areas of Australia there,33
NA,is intense public opposition to the activities of ir-,33
NA,responsible off-road vehicle users. Let me make,33
NA,it quite clear that my criticism is directed to the,33
NA,use of off-road vehicles. I instance a,33
NA,case in the Newcastle area only a matter of,33
NA,months ago where public reaction against the use,33
NA,some of these vehicles was so strong that wires,33
NA,strung across bush tracks used by trail bike,33
NA,obviously in an attempt to decapitate a,33
NA,trail bike riderwho came along. Fortunately the,33
NA,wire was discovered before a fatality occurred.,33
NA,That indicates the intensity of public reaction to,33
NA,is the activities of some of these off-road vehicle,33
NA,It is also rather a sad reflection on govern-,33
NA,in AustraUa generally that State govern-,33
NA,ments have refused consistently to pick up the re-,33
NA,sponsibility for setting aside areas for use,33
NA,exclusively by off-road vehicle enthusiasts. An,33
NA,"off-road vehicle can be a work vehicle, as is used",33
NA,"by departments or as is used by land users, or it",33
NA,"can be a recreational vehicle, as is used by thou-",33
NA,sands upon thousands of AustraUans. There are,33
NA,organised clubs or groups which do have sound,34
NA,principles and regimes to follow as to where they,34
NA,"use their vehicles and how they use their vehicles,",34
NA,and which do have regard to the noise problem,34
NA,that they create. But it is clear from the Minister's,34
NA,statement that to date there has been insufficient,34
NA,evaluation by governments of the suitability of,34
NA,areas that should be set aside for off-road vehicle,34
NA,use.,34
NA,The use of these vehicles has several aspects.,34
NA,"First, there is the damage to the environment",34
NA,itself-th e damage to ground vegetation and to,34
NA,"beach and foreshore areas, the destruction of",34
NA,"wilderness areas and reserves, and the erosion",34
NA,problem overall in all those cases. Then there is,34
NA,the noise problem. This is much more a problem,34
NA,in urban and outer urban areas. I acknowledge,34
NA,"the problem that it creates to wildlife, but I want",34
NA,to deal more specifically with the problem for,34
NA,urban and outer urban areas. There are cases of,34
NA,people virtually being driven out of their homes,34
NA,by the high pitched whine and noise of these ve-,34
NA,hicles because they are operated without,34
NA,silencers or are used irresponsibly by people,34
NA,without regard to the disturbance they are cre-,34
NA,ating. Then there is the danger to the users them-,34
NA,selves. There are regular instances of vehicles,34
NA,"overturning, of accidents and of users being",34
NA,"killed because of poor operation of the trail bike,",34
NA,"the sand dune buggy or the beach buggy, what-",34
NA,ever was being used. But added to that is the,34
NA,public danger of these vehicles careering along,34
NA,"beaches. So there is the noise, the damage, the",34
NA,"despoliation and, as I said before, the danger to",34
NA,the people who are using the beaches for swim-,34
NA,"ming, for sunbaking or just for quite walks. This",34
NA,report from the Government does not really face,34
NA,"up to those problems. However, it does admit",34
NA,that they are problems.,34
NA,I find it rather regrettable,34
NA,ommendations put forward in the report of the,34
NA,House of Representatives Standing Committee,34
NA,on Environment and Conservation- a report that,34
NA,"took some 18 months to bring down, a report",34
NA,that took a great deal of effort by the Comhim. He said:,34
NA,"mittee's members, together with submissions",34
NA,from any organisations-di d not even rate a prohibited,34
NA,mention in the Minister's response. A key recshould,34
NA,ommendation of the Committee was recommenreational,34
NA,"dation No. 5, which states:",34
NA,specific legislation should be introduced in the Australian,34
NA,Capital Territory and the Northern Territoiy as soon,34
NA,ible and should cover the following points:,34
NA,registration of vehicles for recreation use;,34
NA,display of registration plates;,34
NA,third party insurance of these vehicles;,34
NA,age/power limits as in Victorian legislation;,34
NA,compliance with ADR28 on noise levels;,34
NA,provision of areas specifically intended for ORV use;,34
NA,prohibition of the use of vehicles off road except in areas,34
NA,specifically set aside for off-road use.,34
NA,The last item does not even rate a mention in the,34
NA,Minister's response. Yet that is an area-thi s is,34
NA,still the case in the Australian Capital Territory,34
NA,and it was the case in the Northern Territory-i n,34
NA,which tbis Government could have acted in the,34
NA,past 2'/4 years. But it has obviously decided not to,34
NA,act.,34
NA,"Let us turn to recommendation No. 7, which",34
NA,reads:,34
NA,the Commonwealth Government encourageresearchto,34
NA,be undertaken on the carrying capacity of various,34
NA,ecosystems.,34
NA,A key part of the evaluation of the measures that,34
NA,need to be taken to maintain the environment,34
NA,and thereby make the use of these vehicles com-,34
NA,patible with the management and preservation,34
NA,of the environment does not rate a mention by,34
NA,the Government. Recommendation No. 8 reads:,34
NA,the Commonwealth Government sympathetically con-,34
NA,sider request from non-government bodies for financial,34
NA,assistance for this type of research.,34
NA,Once again there is not a mention of this in the,34
NA,Minister's response because it is not a financial,34
NA,priority. I do not think that it even rates with the,34
NA,moral priorities. Recommendation No. 9 reads:,34
NA,the import of over-snow vehicles for recreational pur-,34
NA,poses be prohibited.,34
NA,The Government's response to that has been to,34
NA,say:' We shouldn't use our import powers to con-,34
NA,trol the entry of these vehicles. Let's wait until,34
NA,after they get here and leave it to somebody else,34
NA,to sort it out'. That is exacdy what the Govern-,34
NA,ment has done and that is exactly how this prob-,34
NA,lem has arisen over the years. It is a confession of,34
NA,that six of the 1S recfailure.,34
NA,Mr Groom-Yo u misinterpret what I said.,34
Mr MORRIS,"I t is not a misinterpretation, as",34
NA,the Minister interjects. I will read his words to,34
NA,. . . the importation of over-snow recreation vehicles be,34
NA,and that an environmental impact assessment,34
NA,be carried out before any new type of off-road rec-,34
NA,vehicle was imported.,34
NA,"Now that is all off-road recreation vehicles, not",34
NA,just over-snow recreation vehicles. As the Minis-,34
NA,"as posster said in his speech, the Government considers",34
NA,that legislation for controls on use after entry into,34
NA,Australia would be more effective than import,34
NA,restricuons. That is a confession of failure. It is a,34
NA,refusal to face up to what I have said is a very,34
NA,serious problem. In effect the Government is,34
NA,passing the buck down the line to State govern-,35
NA,ments and further down the line to local govern-,35
NA,"ment, and local government receives the major",35
NA,impact of complaints. There is intense public op-,35
NA,position to the way in which some of these ve-,35
NA,"hicles are being used and local government, least",35
NA,"of all, has the powers to control and regulate this",35
NA,problem. It is the Government's refusal to face,35
NA,up to that that is at the core of this problem.,35
NA,Recommendation No. 10 reads:,35
NA,rehabilitation of tracks no longer in use should be,35
NA,"taken by the company, government depanment or",35
NA,sponsible for creating the tracks.,35
NA,That is a non-defence area. The Minister's state-,35
NA,ment referred to activities by the Department of,35
NA,Defence in respect of areas under its control.,35
NA,welcome that. But the Minister makes no,35
NA,ence to other areas of land under the control of,35
NA,non-defence departments of government. There,35
NA,"the Government should have acted, but it has",35
NA,not acted. Recommendation No. 13 reads:,35
NA,further research be done by the Commonwealth Department,35
NA,of Transport with a view to decreasing the maximum,35
NA,limits imposed on motor bikes under ADR 28.,35
NA,This is the important problem that I referred,35
NA,earlier in my remarks. That is where the greatest,35
NA,"upset and disturbance are created, particularly",35
NA,for aged people in urban and outer urban areas.,35
NA,People have been forced to sell up their homes,35
NA,and get away from the constant noise created,35
NA,the use of these vehicles travelling around urban,35
NA,streets. Recommendation No. 14 reads:,35
NA,responsible authorities require proprietors,35
NA,implement good conservation programs.,35
NA,No mention at all was made of this in the Minis-,35
NA,"ter's speech. Again, it could have been part of the",35
NA,public relations exercise; it could have been in-,35
NA,cluded in the code that has been developed;,35
NA,could have been an exercise that,35
NA,readily carried out by the Federal Government if,35
NA,it had had the desire.,35
NA,I turn back to recommendation No. 4 which,35
NA,reads:,35
NA,"the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community",35
NA,Development-,35
NA,That was the name of the portfolio in earlier,35
NA,days-,35
NA,request the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers to de-,35
NA,velop national guidelines for legislation and management,35
NA,policy regarding off-road vehicles.,35
NA,The Minister has referred to that in his state-,35
NA,"ment. But, regrettably, all he has said was: 'That",35
NA,matter has been taken up with the State conser-,35
NA,vation Ministers'. But the Government has had,35
NA,2Vi years in which to take it up and to consider it?,35
NA,Mr Jacobi-Tha t is pretty quick for it.,35
Mr MORRIS,"Yes, I confess that it is, for this",35
NA,Government. The Committee of the House and,35
NA,the Parliament are entided to be told what,35
NA,progress has been made in the 2'/i years. Are we,35
NA,to be told after another 2W years: 'We are sorry,35
NA,that after five years we have not been able to,35
NA,"achieve anything'? In essence, the way in which",35
NA,the Minister has responded to that recommen-,35
NA,dation has been simply to say: 'We have taken it,35
NA,up with the State Conservation Ministers and it is,35
NA,"under discussion, but we cannot tell you any-",35
NA,underthing about it'. That indicates the lack of concern,35
NA,person reby the Government for this very important,35
NA,problem.,35
NA,"On behalf of the Opposition, I thank the",35
NA,We members of the House of Representatives Stand-,35
NA,refering Committee on Environment and Conser-,35
NA,vation who participated in the inquiry. They will,35
NA,be sorry to see that the Government has not,35
NA,given the Committee's report any serious con-,35
NA,sideration and has not taken the action that it,35
NA,should have taken. I thank also those people who,35
NA,noise made submissions to the Committee. At the same,35
NA,ume let me emphasise that the remarks I have,35
NA,to made about much of the damage caused by,35
NA,off-road vehicles is directed to the irresponsible,35
NA,users of those vehicles. If the people who are par-,35
NA,ticipating in the organised use of off-road ve-,35
NA,"hicles continue on those organised lines, in the",35
NA,by absence of any firm action by this Government,35
NA,the community itself can try to do something to,35

NA,NEGOTIATIONS,36
NA,Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,36
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Millar)- Mr,36
NA,Speaker has received letters from both the,36
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel,36
NA,Bowen) and the honourable member for St Foreign,36
NA,George ( Mr Neil) proposing that definite matport,36
NA,ters of public importance be submitted to the,36
NA,House for discussion today. As required by,36
NA,"Standing Order 107, Mr Speaker has selected the",36
NA,"matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent",36
NA,"and important, that is, that proposed by the",36
NA,"Deputy Leader of the Opposition, namely:",36
NA,The Government's failure,36
NA,of the multilateral trade negotiations and the codes of con-,36
NA,duct thereunder.,36
NA,I therefore call upon those members who ap-,36
NA,prove of the proposed discussion to rise in their,36
NA,places.,36
NA,More than the number of members required by,36
NA,the Standing Orders having risen in their places-,36
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith),36
NA,(11.55)-Th e matter before the House is of im-,36
NA,portance and is self-explanatory. The Govern-,36
NA,ment has not disclosed to the Parliament or to,36
NA,the people concerned what its policy is in respect,36
NA,of the multilateral trade negotiations-,36
NA,particularly the concessions that the Government,36
NA,has given-an d its attitude to the codes of con-,36
NA,duct which are prescribed under those nego-,36
NA,tiations. For some time the Opposition in this,36
NA,House has been urging the Government to de-,36
NA,clare and disclose what its policy is on these vital,36
NA,matters. The reason for so doing is that it affects,36
NA,the whole of Australian industry. In a series of,36
NA,statements that have been made in the House,36
NA,and outside the House we have all sorts of views,36
NA,put forward by Government Ministers. At this,36
NA,stage we might say that we have about four Min-,36
NA,isters for Trade-th e Prime Minister ( Mr,36
NA,"Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister",36
NA,"( Mr Anthony), the Minister for Special Trade",36
NA,Representations ( Mr Garland) and the Minister,36
NA,NA,36
NA,to come in with his ideas as to how trade should be,36
NA,conducted.,36
NA,We can understand the situation in terms of,36
NA,members of the Government trying to grapple,36
NA,with a policy which apparently they have not yet,36
NA,d been able to agree upon amongst themselves;,36
NA,"but it does little credit to the Government, when",36
NA,it is talking about unemployment and the prob-,36
NA,"lems of creating employment opportunities, that",36
NA,it cannot give any lead to industry. People in the,36
NA,textile and apparel manufacturing industry,36
NA,would like to know where they are going to stand,36
NA,from the point of view of investment. They are,36
NA,working on the basis of a life of virtually six,36
NA,"months or 12 months, depending on what the",36
NA,Government is going to decide. If honourable,36
NA,members take notice of what the Minister for,36
NA,Affairs said yesterday and look at the re-,36
NA,"on negotiations with the Third World, they",36
NA,will see that the reasoning adopted there is that,36
NA,there is no need for us to have a textile and,36
NA,"apparel industry. That might be argued, but at",36
NA,"the present time we have 107,000 people in that",36
NA,"industry and, with the multiplier factor, the em-",36
NA,"ployment of another 200,000.",36
NA,to disclose its policy in respect,36
NA,The industry leaders come to the Government,36
NA,and say: 'What is your policy? Are we expected,36
NA,to survive or do you want us to go out of busi-,36
NA,"ness? If it is the latter, why should we bother to",36
NA,invest in new machinery? Why should we bother,36
NA,to put our money into something which has no,36
NA,future? What is the Government's policy in this,36
NA,regard.'? I am impressed that they are able to,36
NA,produce figures which show that there has been a,36
NA,substantial reduction in the manufacturing base;,36
NA,"that some 57,000 employees have gone in the",36
NA,last three years. The textile and apparel industry,36
NA,"says: If this continues, why should there be any",36
NA,"will to keep going?' For example, the industry",36
NA,"leaders say that, should no permanency be given",36
NA,to the industry from the point of view of a five or,36
NA,"seven year plan, 10,000 jobs could be lost in",36
NA,Ballarat and Bendigo alone. They talk about the,36
NA,"fact that a factory in Talbot, Victoria, has opened",36
NA,and closed four times in the last five years. They,36
NA,are able to say that if the Government is going to,36
NA,"get rid of that industry areas such as Geelong,",36
NA,"Ararat, Stawell, Casdemaine, Warrnambool,",36
NA,"Talbot, Wangaratta and others will lose substan-",36
NA,"tial numbers of employees, and that every indus-",36
NA,try in Swan Hill has been forced out in the last 15,36
NA,years. I have given honourable members the de-,36
NA,tails ofjust one industry.,36
NA,There is a genuine concern that we cannot find,36
NA,out what the Government has offered by way of,36
NA,concessions in the multilateral trade nego-,37
NA,tiations. It is not valid to say that we are,37
NA,ing our capacity because our exports have,37
NA,increased in value. The big argument is in con-,37
NA,nection with the quantity. That is the point. Mr,37
NA,"Deputy Speaker, you know of the extraordinary",37
NA,situation in which the sugar industryfindsitself,37
NA,now because of the attitudes adopted by the,37
NA,European Economic Community in subsidising,37
NA,"its sugar, dumping it on the world, and virtually",37
NA,"wrecking our industry. So, when we are talking",37
NA,"about doing business with the world, let us look",37
NA,at it on the basis that we are basically doing busi-,37
NA,ness with the developed countries of the world,37
NA,and those countries are out to look after them-,37
NA,selves. When we ask in this Parliament what con-,37
NA,"cessions we have given to the EEC, we are un-",37
NA,able to find out. When we ask in this Parliament,37
NA,"what concessions we have given to Japan, we",37
NA,cannot find out. We are told that we have got,37
NA,some concessions. We are told that we have been,37
NA,allowed to sell some buffalo beef and a few,37
NA,tonnes of cheese. But what did we give in return?,37
NA,"In regard to the EEC, I am advised that, whilst",37
NA,we might have got $200m work of concessions,37
NA,"from it, we might have given $400m by way of",37
NA,our concessions and this can affect our industry.,37
NA,We do not want any more secrecy. We do not,37
NA,want any more ineptitude. The real thrust,37
NA,what we are about is that we seem to have four,37
NA,Ministers all saying different things. Somebody,37
NA,has said that they ought to be called the 'gang,37
NA,four' or the Marx Brothers. No solution is evideemed,37
NA,dent from what they say. We want to know,37
NA,is the Government's policy. Not only should we,37
NA,know it in the interests of ordinary democracy.,37
NA,"What about the industry leaders, the trade union",37
NA,movement and everybody else wanting to know,37
NA,where funds ought to be invested or where there,37
NA,will be job opportunities? These arrangements,37
NA,have been made under the multilateral trade,37
NA,negotiations. We were not able to participate,37
NA,rectly. It would appear that we had to rely on,37
NA,Japanese to put our case. The question is: What,37
NA,industries have been affected? We have been,37
NA,told nothing about the matter although a total,37
NA,number of statements have been made.,37
NA,I make the salient point that it appears that,37
NA,United States of America Congress has been told,37
NA,all about it. I have here a document entitled:,37
NA,Message from the President ofthe United States,37
NA,"to His Congress', dated 19 June. That document",37
NA,indicates the arrangements that have been made,37
NA,with Australia. It deals with the understanding,37
NA,on meat and the understanding on dairy prodprovided,37
NA,"ucts, United States tariff concessions and section",37
NA,IV deals with Australian tariff concessions. This,37
NA,document can be obtained in any area in,37
NA,increasAustralia because it has been tabled in the,37
NA,United States Congress. These matters have not,37
NA,been discussed or disclosed and have not even,37
NA,been tabled or prepared to be discussed in this,37
NA,Parliament. The document relates to a number of,37
NA,"matters, including: Tobacco, refrigerators, trac-",37
NA,tors and textiles. All these matters are the subject,37
NA,of concessions. We cannot find out what they are.,37
NA,This will have a serious effect on the confidence,37
NA,of industry leaders. They have come to the Op-,37
NA,position and said that it is about time that the,37
NA,Government clearly indicated its position. There,37
NA,has been no consultation with industry leaders,37
NA,and the trade union movement as to the direction,37
NA,we are heading. It is understandable that the,37
NA,"Japanese, the European Economic Community",37
NA,and the United States are keen to look after,37
NA,themselves. They have obviously made their own,37
NA,arrangements as to how they will give safeguards,37
NA,to their employees and manufacturers. That is,37
NA,not the situation in Australia.,37
NA,I turn now to the two big problems associated,37
NA,with the codes of conduct. They relate to specific,37
NA,instances. The codes provide that there be no,37
NA,"subsidies, countervailing duties or government",37
NA,procurement. The people who have made rep-,37
NA,resentations to us have said that the removal of,37
NA,of subsidies could well affect the whole of the,37
NA,Export Expansion Grants Scheme if the arrange-,37
NA,ments entered into are deemed to be illegal. This,37
NA,of could well be so. Export finance could be,37
NA,to be a subsidy. If that is the position the,37
NA,what Government's policy in this area could be,37
NA,declared illegal if it adopts the codes of conduct.,37
NA,I turn now to government procurement. I under-,37
NA,stand that if government purchases are over,37
NA,"$ 175,000 the contracts cannot have the protec-",37
NA,tion of being open only within the domestic mar-,37
NA,ket; they have to be open to the international,37
NA,market. At present goods and services procured,37
NA,diby the Australian Government are estimated to,37
NA,the amount to $4 billion per annum. The codes of,37
NA,conduct would also cover State government pur-,37
NA,chases which involve an additional $8 billion- a,37
NA,of $12 billion. Australian industry could,37
NA,well have to forfeit that amount of government,37
NA,the money which it is presently receiving. Do,37
NA,honourable members think that the textile and,37
NA,'A apparel industry could survive if it is unable to,37
NA,get government procurement contracts? Hospital,37
NA,"bedding, linen, sheets and nurses uniforms",37
NA,amount to a significant factor to that industry. If,37
NA,the Government enters into the arrangements,37
NA,"under the codes of conduct, then a pro-",37
NA,"curement contract of over $175,000 would be li-",37
NA,able to go to the international market. In other,37
NA,"words, it would go to an overseas country. This is",38
NA,an important factor.,38
NA,The last Budget provided $ 170m to encourage,38
NA,the Export Expansion Grants Scheme. If the,38
NA,"codes of conduct as determined by the EEC, the",38
NA,United States and Japan is agreed upon this,38
NA,scheme would be illegal. So it is in the interest,38
NA,not only of normal parliamentary courtesy and,38
NA,debate but also of industry following its rec-,38
NA,ommendations that the Government refrain,38
NA,from taking a decision on the subsidy codes of,38
NA,conduct for some time until it becomes clear,38
NA,from the actions of our trading partners what the,38
NA,consequences might be. Whilst there may be no,38
NA,"doubt that the United States, the EEC and Japan",38
NA,will look after themselves and will sign the codes,38
NA,"of conduct, it is important that we clearly indi-",38
NA,cate our position. I make it clear that if we accept,38
NA,this package we will concede not only the disad-,38
NA,vantage of distance but also the disadvantage of,38
NA,unequal concessions. The Government has again,38
NA,demonstrated its inability or unwillingness to,38
NA,accept the realities of world trade. We under-,38
NA,stand the problems which arise from imposing,38
NA,too much protection. Nobody would argue about,38
NA,"that. But at present, with coming recessions, the",38
NA,energy crisis and rapidly increasing unemploy-,38
NA,ment throughout the world it is important that,38
NA,we look at the purchasing power of other nations.,38
NA,Purchasing power in the Third World is not,38
NA,readily identifiable but it can be expected to sur-,38
NA,vive in the countries which have a stranglehold,38
NA,on us if we are put in the position of having to,38
NA,subscribe to these codes of conduct. This would,38
NA,mean that our industries could go to the wall. We,38
NA,are not talking about restrictions on the Third,38
NA,World. We are talking about our understanding,38
NA,of the position at present because of unplanned,38
NA,action by the Government.,38
NA,I refer to tyres which are covered in this,38
NA,ment. In the Firestone Australia Pty Ltd factory,38
NA,at Auburn in Sydney on 21 August 700 workers,38
NA,were laid off because the company could not,38
NA,keep up with the competition. That is indicative,38
NA,of what is happening. Again I make the point,38
NA,that we have to have structural adjustment.,38
NA,There has to be change. But let it be understood,38
NA,what we are about. Do not let us have all the,38
NA,hypocrisy from the Prime Minister. He becomes,38
NA,a free trader overseas and an arch protectionist,38
NA,at home. I am told that in a speech on 9 May,38
NA,the United Nations Conference on Trade and,38
NA,Development meeting he clearly indicated that,38
NA,he would virtually drop tariffs. Yet when he,38
NA,came back to Australia he imposed an import find,38
NA,customs duty on previously freely imported,38
NA,modities. This behaviour brings Australia into,38
NA,disgrace in world negotiations. Last year the,38
NA,Government seemed to be extremely protection-,38
NA,ist. This year its policy is one of extremely free,38
NA,trade. Is it any wonder that industry in Australia,38
NA,does not know which way to turn? This is remi-,38
NA,niscent of the problems we had-extremis t and,38
NA,inconsistent.,38
NA,In raising this discussion of a matter of public,38
NA,importance we urge the Government to provide,38
NA,a draft statement of what it has in mind before,38
NA,making any final decisions on the codes of con-,38
NA,duct and to make public in full the tariff con-,38
NA,cessions offered before they are settled. That is,38
NA,the important thing we say to the Government. It,38
NA,is useless for us to talk to industry leaders on,38
NA,what we understand the situation to be. Despite,38
NA,repeated requests in this Parliament we cannot,38
NA,get details. Yet astoundingly we are able to get,38
NA,them by a normal process of obtaining a copy of,38
NA,what was tabled in the United States. I ask per-,38
NA,mission of the right honourable gentleman to,38
NA,table the concessions which are outlined in the,38
NA,document entitled: 'A Message from the Presi-,38
NA,dent of the United States to his Congress' and,38
NA,which relate to what is called an agreement with,38
NA,Australia.,38
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Armitage)-Is,38
NA,leave granted?,38
Mr ANTHONY ,"No , leave is not granted.",38
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Leave is not,38
NA,granted.,38
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,That is indicative of,38
NA,the situation. This published information can be,38
NA,obtained somewhere else. Major industry leaders,38
NA,want an undertaking- I hope one is given in,38
NA,reply-tha t the Government will not agree to the,38
NA,docucodes of conduct until everybody has had a,38
NA,chance to put their point of view. I repeat that,38
NA,having no subsidies and countervailing duties,38
NA,could affect the whole of the Export Expansion,38
NA,"Grants Scheme. But most importantly, under the",38
NA,"codes of conduct, government procurement con-",38
NA,tracts would be thrown open to world tender if,38
NA,"they involve more than $175,000. I make the",38
NA,point that $12 billion a year is involved in that,38
NA,area. If those contracts are thrown open it would,38
NA,destroy our industry. That is what the people,38
NA,at from industiy are saying when they come to us.,38
NA,They cannot get any decision from the Govern-,38
NA,"ment. They have approached the Opposition, for",38
NA,which they never vote-le t us make that clear-t o,38
NA,out our position which is to provide stability,38
NA,"comin Australia, economic development and under-",38
NA,standing of future employment opportunities. In,38
NA,fairness to the people of Australia the Govern-,39
NA,ment should now indicate what its attitude will,39
NA,be.,39
Mr ANTHONY ,Richmond-Minister for,39
NA,Trade and Resources) (12.9)-The Deputy,39
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) in,39
NA,proposing this matter of public importance is try-,39
NA,ing to discredit the Government's negotiating,39
NA,performance at the round of Multilateral Trade,39
NA,Negotiations and he is trying to heap confusion,39
NA,and concern on the minds of people involved in,39
NA,certain sections of Australian industry. If any-,39
NA,"thing, his effort today really displays his own",39
NA,of knowledge. He has not kept himself as well,39
NA,informed of what is going on as he might have. I,39
NA,am very pleased to have this opportunity to,39
NA,speak so that some of those people who might be,39
NA,confused will know how eminently successful the,39
NA,Australian Government has been in the course of,39
NA,these negotiations and in what it has achieved for,39
NA,Australia. What are negodations of this nature?,39
NA,They are negotiations by Australia to seek cer-,39
NA,tain benefits such as access to markets at the low-,39
NA,est possible price. Although we have to give con-,39
NA,"cessions, naturally we want to keep them as",39
NA,"minimal as possible. By the same token, we want",39
NA,to achieve our objectives of lower tariffs round,39
NA,the world and of getting access to markets. What,39
NA,we have done has been of immense importance,39
NA,and value to the Australian export industries and,39
NA,it has had a negligible effect on Australian dom-,39
NA,estic industry.,39
NA,We have maintained a consistent policy,39
NA,proach and we have continued to make inforindustry-th,39
NA,mation available to the Australian public during,39
NA,the negotiations and when we have been in a,39
NA,position to notify the public of what has been,39
NA,going on. We have accepted the challenge to,39
NA,come involved in the Multilateral Trade Negoproduce,39
NA,tiations round to try to liberalise international,39
NA,trade. As AustraUa is a major trading nation it,39
NA,important that we do everything possible to keep,39
NA,international trade flowing. Our major objective,39
NA,"in these negotiations, which have been continuthe",39
NA,"ing since 1972, has been to achieve a greater libtralian",39
NA,eralisation of agricultural trade-t o get greater,39
NA,"access to the North American market, to Japan",39
NA,and into the European Economic Community.,39
NA,We have used whatever political weight and,39
NA,influence we have to try to get a recognition,39
NA,our point of view.,39
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has,39
NA,made some play on the fact that a number of quantity,39
NA,Ministers have been involved in making comno,39
NA,ments related to these negotiations. If we can,39
NA,a benefit from a visit by the Prime Minister ( Mr,39
NA,"Malcolm Fraser) to Europe, to the United States",39
NA,or Japan then why not take advantage ofhis pos-,39
NA,ition which enables him to exercise great,39
NA,influence on other governments? Within the EEC,39
NA,in which we have needed to do immense lobby-,39
NA,ing to have our point of view accepted we have,39
NA,had a special Minister who has devoted a great,39
NA,deal of time to becoming acquainted and fam-,39
NA,iliar with the people who make the decisions in,39
NA,Europe. A lot of homework was necessary on,39
NA,Europe because it was during the three years of,39
NA,the Labor regime that AustraUa was almost,39
NA,entirely shut out of Europe. Of course it was dur-,39
NA,lack ing that period that we were also shut out of,39
NA,Japan. In 1974 Japan completely shut out our,39
NA,beef.,39
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Tha t is not so. You nego-,39
NA,tiated the arrangements. You are still shut out,39
NA,with hides.,39
Mr ANTHONY,Listen to the Deputy Leader,39
NA,ofthe Opposition making those inane comments.,39
NA,"Australia, as well as the whole world, has been",39
NA,shut out from exporting hides into Japan. But it,39
NA,was during the Labor Government of 1974 that,39
NA,AustraUa was actually shut out of Japan. Diplo-,39
NA,macy was required to get our points of view,39
NA,registered and heard in order to establish a new,39
NA,"relationship with these countries and today, we",39
NA,have that situation. I quite frankly admit that the,39
NA,"result of negotiations, particularly as far as",39
NA,"agriculture is concerned, has not been as good as",39
NA,we hoped. But at least we made some progress-,39
NA,very valuable progress. Most significant gains,39
NA,aphave been made for Australia's biggest single,39
NA,e beef industry. This year it is pro-,39
NA,"ducing something like $2,500m worth of pro-",39
NA,duce. A few years ago the beef industry was in a,39
NA,terrible state because it could not get rid of its,39
NA,beproduce. There was a reduction in the amount of,39
NA,it could get into the United States; it was,39
NA,practically shut out of the EEC and Japan. The,39
NA,is industry was in a terrible situation of oversupply,39
NA,and ruinously low prices. But as a result of the,39
NA,Multilateral Trade Negotiations we have made,39
NA,most remarkable achievement for the Aus-,39
NA,cattle industry. It is the most significant,39
NA,thing that has ever happened for Australia's,39
NA,cattle industry. Bear in mind that this year it is,39
NA,Australia's biggest industry.,39
NA,What have we achieved? We have achieved,39
NA,of guaranteed access to the markets of the United,39
NA,"States, the EEC and Japan and soon I hope to be",39
NA,able to finalise arrangements with Canada for a,39
NA,of Australian meat to go in to its market,39
NA,matter what the circumstances. In other,39
NA,"get words, a minimum amount of meat can be sold",39
NA,through those markets. If all the export quotas,39
NA,were reduced to the minimum amount it would,39
NA,account for approximately 70 per cent of,40
NA,Australia's beef exports. That is a remarkable,40
NA,and wonderful security for the beef industry. The,40
NA,industry has never before had anything like that.,40
NA,It always has been completely exposed and vul-,40
NA,nerable to the closing off of overseas markets as,40
NA,we saw during the period Labor was in office.,40
NA,But now we have a guaranteed access for a mini-,40
NA,mum amount and that has been the biggest,40
NA,achievement in the Multilateral Trade Negot-,40
NA,iations. We placed a good deal of emphasis on,40
NA,the industry because it was in a tremendously,40
NA,desperate situation and needed some form of se-,40
NA,curity for the future. It now has arrangement that,40
NA,"will cover it for the next 10 years, for the decade",40
NA,of the 1980s. I hope the people associated with,40
NA,and dependent on the Australian cattle industry,40
NA,appreciate what the Australian Government has,40
NA,done. As well we have accomplished other,40
NA,smaller things.,40
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Wha t are the concessions?,40
Mr ANTHONY, I will discuss the con-,40
NA,cessions in a minute.,40
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Yo u have five minutes left.,40
Mr ANTHONY,Tha t is adequate to cope,40
NA,with the honourable member when I tell him,40
NA,what some of the concessions are. We have con-,40
NA,cessions that will help the dairy industry. One,40
NA,concession involves an increase of the cheese,40
NA,quota into the EEC and the United States. Pre-,40
NA,"viously we had a quota of only 1,600 tonnes in to",40
NA,the United States whereas now we have a quota,40
NA,"of 4,000 tonnes. What about wool? Since the be-",40
NA,ginning of this century we have been arguing and,40
NA,fighting with the United States for reduction in,40
NA,the wool duty. As a result of those negotiations,40
NA,we have a 60 per cent reduction in the tariff level,40
NA,"on wool and I hope that the revival of, and the",40
NA,"additional sales of wool to, the United States",40
NA,market will be worth a lot to the Australian in-,40
NA,dustry. The United States market is one of the,40
NA,biggest markets in the world but manufacturers,40
NA,virtually ceased to use our wool because of the,40
NA,deterrent of the higher duty on wool imports. We,40
NA,have been able to get many other useful benefits,40
NA,in course of the negotiations including quotas on,40
NA,"fresh fruits, dried fruits, canned fruits, meat",40
NA,"offals, wheat gluten and beef tallow which",40
NA,although relatively small benefits are important,40
NA,to our industries.,40
NA,We have endeavoured to keep the Australian,40
NA,public informed on these negotiations. It all,40
NA,started in 1972 in informal discussions in Geneva,40
NA,when officers of my then Department indicated,40
NA,their willingness to participate in these great,40
NA,ternational talks which were to take place. In,40
NA,1973 the Tokyo declaration was made and since,40
NA,then there has been progressive development. I,40
NA,felt that in Australia there was a bipartisan ap-,40
NA,proach to the international negotiations but ob-,40
NA,viously the Department Leader of the Oppo-,40
NA,sition is trying to make some political capital out,40
NA,of them. Last year a major statement was made,40
NA,on Australia's new approach to the negotiations.,40
NA,We were prepared to enter into them on the for-,40
NA,"mula approach. In other words, we were pre-",40
NA,pared to trade a 40 per cent across the board,40
NA,"tariff cut, if that was necessary, with certain",40
NA,qualifications. This year after major negotiations,40
NA,"which I was invloved in had taken place, I made",40
NA,a statement to the House on the progress up to,40
NA,that stage. The Prime Minister and the Minister,40
NA,for Special Trade Representations ( Mr Garland),40
NA,made statements on 9 May this year. I have,40
NA,made Press statements concerning the code and,40
NA,had provided to industry information which I,40
NA,will mention in a minute.,40
NA,Honourable members might well ask what we,40
NA,have paid to get the benefits for wbich I have,40
NA,"asked. We have given concessions. Basically,",40
NA,those concessions have amounted to a binding of,40
NA,"existing levels of tariff. In other words, we have",40
NA,been able to get the full benefit of the 25 per cent,40
NA,across-the-board tariff cut that the Labor,40
NA,Government inflicted upon industry in 1974. We,40
NA,have negotiated to get the full benefit of that,40
NA,"tariff cut. As a result, not one single industrial",40
NA,tariff will be reduced. We have bound approxi-,40
NA,mately 120 items. That has been the price that,40
NA,we have had to pay. There has been no reduction,40
NA,at all in industrial tariffs. There have been a few,40
NA,reductions in non-industrial tariffs but we have,40
NA,not had to pay any price. All we have done is,40
NA,frozen approximately 120 items. There will be no,40
NA,tariff cuts on industrial items. I said initially that,40
NA,the whole purpose of negotiations is to try to get,40
NA,the best benefit at the least price. Honourable,40
NA,members must acclaim that we have done a,40
NA,magnificent job in our negotiations when we,40
NA,have come out of them without having to pay,40
NA,anything more than making a binding on indus-,40
NA,trial tariffs. If there have to be any adjustments,40
NA,on those bindings because of an Industries As-,40
NA,sistance Commission investigation there will,40
NA,have to be further negotiations and we will have,40
NA,to pay in another area.,40
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Wha t about the codes?,40
Mr ANTHONY,The honourable member,40
NA,asked about the codes. I am coming to them.,40
NA,Five codes are under examination. The Govern-,40
NA,ment has not committed itself on whether it will,40
NA,in- be a signatory to those codes. It has circulated,40
NA,them to all the relevant industry people. Officers,40
NA,of my Department are travelling from State to,41
NA,"State talking with State governments, industry",41
NA,people and the trade unions. When we get a re-,41
NA,sponse from these people the Government will,41
NA,be in a position to know whether it will sign all,41
NA,these codes or none at all. What could be a more,41
NA,responsible way of approaching this matter than,41
NA,"that? We are canvassing the reaction of industry,",41
NA,trade unions and State governments as to,41
NA,whether we ought to sign these codes. When we,41
NA,have their response we will be able to make a de-,41
NA,cision. How else would we make such a decision?,41
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,The y start on 1 January.,41
Mr ANTHONY,The Government will have,41
NA,time because the codes have been circulated for a,41
NA,couple of months. Already we are getting reac-,41
NA,tions from industiy. We will make our decision in,41
NA,ample time. We will be successful in this oper-,41
NA,"ation, as we have been in all the others. What I",41
NA,have said today ought to expose the falseness of,41
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the state-,41
NA,ments he has made. He would like us to reveal,41
NA,the nature of our negotiations. In some cases that,41
NA,would be completely discourteous. At the worst it,41
NA,would be irresponsible. Why should we give,41
NA,away the advantage of negotiations by declaring,41
NA,in advance what the arrangements have been?,41
NA,Negotiations are still proceeding with Canada,41
NA,and Switzerland. Until settlement of the nego-,41

NA,AMENDMENT BILL 1979,41
NA,"Bill presented by Mr Street, and read a first",41
NA,time.,41
NA,Second Reading,41
Mr STREET ,Corangamite-Minister for In-,41
NA,dustrial Relations) (12.25)- I move:,41
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,41
NA,This Bill proposes amendments to the Concili-,41
NA,ation and Arbitration Act which are designed to,41
NA,remedy deficiencies in the operation of the Act,41
NA,which have become evident in recent months.,41
NA,The amendments will:,41
NA,require a commissioner to consult with his,41
NA,deputy president before making or varying an,41
NA,award relating to wages and condiuons;,41
NA,"prohibit the Commission from ordering,",41
NA,"recommending or sanctioning in any way, an",41
NA,employer paying wages to an employee for,41
NA,time when the employee was engaged in in-,41
NA,dustrial action;,41
NA,provide for the expeditious hearing of,41
NA,"stand-down applications, either before a",41
NA,single member of the Commission or a full,41
NA,bench;,41
NA,provide that the question of whether an,41
NA,industrial dispute exists may be the subject of,41
NA,a reference to a full bench;,41
NA,enable an industrial dispute or part of an in-,41
NA,dustrial dispute to be referred to a full bench at,41
NA,the conciliation state;,41
NA,reinforce the powers of the President of the,41
NA,Commission by enabling him to withdraw a,41
NA,matter from another member of the Com-,41
NA,mission and either deal with it himself or refer,41
NA,the matter in a full bench; and,41
NA,provide increased protection for the com-,41
NA,munity by creating an alternative path to the,41
NA,deregistration of organisations and thereby re-,41
NA,move delays in the deregistration process in,41
NA,"cases where the safety, health or welfare of the",41
NA,community are put at risk by industrial action.,41
NA,Consultation with the National Labour,41
NA,Consultative Council,41
NA,Before dealing more fully with the substance,41
NA,"of the proposed amendments, I want to refer to",41
NA,the process of consultation in the National,41
NA,Labour Consultative Council. The Government,41
NA,established the National Labour Consultative,41
NA,"Council by statute in 1977 as a continuing, tri-",41
NA,"partite consultative body. As a general practice,",41
NA,proposals involving industrial relations and,41
NA,"manpower issues, including possible legislation,",41
NA,are submitted to the Council for discussion and,42
NA,expression of views for Government's consider-,42
NA,ation. The Government's initial proposals about,42
NA,the particular issues dealt with in the Bill before,42
NA,the House were discussed by the NLCC at its,42
NA,12th meeting on 6 August this year.,42
NA,Representatives of the Australian Council of,42
NA,Trade Unions and the Council of Australian,42
NA,Government Employee Organisations did not,42
NA,attend that meeting. Both organisations had for-,42
NA,mally advised me that their executives had,42
NA,jointly resolved on 16 July not to participate in,42
NA,NLCC discussions pending resolution of certain,42
NA,matters.,42
NA,"I wrote to both organisations on 26 July,",42
NA,stressing the importance the Government placed,42
NA,on the role of the Council. I received no response,42
NA,to these letters prior to 6 August meeting of the,42
NA,NLCC. I might add that I subsequently received,42
NA,replies in late August and early September advis-,42
NA,ing that both organisations were prepared to re-,42
NA,sume their participation in NLCC discussions,42
NA,subject to certain conditions. I replied to their let-,42
NA,ters on 7 September and I hope to see both or-,42
NA,ganisations resume their participation in Council.,42
NA,The Council regretted the absence of union,42
NA,representatives at the 6 August meeting. Never-,42
NA,"theless, the Council felt obliged to carry out its",42
NA,"statutory functions. As on previous occasions, the",42
NA,"Government, in finalising its proposed legis-",42
NA,"lation, has given careful consideration to the",42
NA,points raised in the Council's discussions.,42
NA,Requirement of Consultation by Commissioners,42
NA,The Bill proposes that a commissioner be,42
NA,required to consult with his deputy president be-,42
NA,fore making or varying an award with respect to,42
NA,wages and conditions. There is a complex range,42
NA,of awards and registered agreements operating,42
NA,in industries coming within the jurisdiction ofthe,42
NA,ConciUation and Arbitration Commission. This,42
NA,very fact demands consistency of principle in de-,42
NA,cision making within the Commission itself. Re-,42
NA,grettably there have been some occasions when,42
NA,such consistency has been lacking. The conse-,42
NA,quences for the community have been very,42
NA,"serious, both industrially and economically. The",42
NA,proposed consultative process is designed to pro-,42
NA,vide greater co-ordination and consistency in de-,42
NA,cision making within the Commission.,42
NA,Powers of the Commission in Relation to,42
NA,Payments to Workers for time lost through,42
NA,industrial action,42
NA,I turn next to the proposal to limit the powers,42
NA,of the Commission in relation to payments to,42
NA,workers for time lost through industrial action.,42
NA,At present the Commission may provide for pay-,42
NA,ment to employees in respect of time not worked,42
NA,because they were engaged in industrial action.,42
NA,This is undesirable by any standards. Not only,42
NA,"does it encourage irresponsible industrial action,",42
NA,but also it forces the employer to pay for the very,42
NA,disruption that puts his business at risk and dam-,42
NA,ages the economic and social life of the com-,42
NA,munity. It is an outlandish concept and indeed,42
NA,makes a mockery of any supposed 'right to,42
NA,strike'. This legislation now makes it quite clear,42
NA,"that the Commission wUl not be able to award,",42
NA,"or in any way sanction, payment for time lost",42
NA,through industrial action. Accordingly the Bill,42
NA,proposes an amendment to the Act to provide,42
NA,that the Commission is not empowered to make,42
NA,"an award, certify a memorandum of agreement,",42
NA,make a recommendation or take any other,42
NA,"action, whether by way of concUiation or arbi-",42
NA,"tration, in respect of a claim for the making of a",42
NA,payment to employees in respect of a period dur-,42
NA,ing which those employees were engaged in in-,42
NA,dustrial action.,42
NA,Stand-down applications,42
NA,The BUl proposes amendments to require the,42
NA,Commission to deal expeditiously with stand-,42
NA,down applications. A stand-down clause is one,42
NA,that authorises an employer not to pay some or,42
NA,"all of his employees in specified circumstances,",42
NA,"for example, where they cannot be usefully",42
NA,employed because of a breakdown of machinery,42
NA,or industrial action by other employees. Appli-,42
NA,cations for stand-down clauses are usually dealt,42
NA,with by a Commissioner or Deputy President.,42
NA,There are 3 main reasons why the Government is,42
NA,proposing these amendments to speed up the,42
NA,process for consideration of stand-down clauses,42
NA,"in awards. Firstly, the harmful effects of indus-",42
NA,"trial action on any enterprise are often serious,",42
NA,and they can be disastrous in the case of small,42
NA,employers. There is little they can do to protect,42
NA,themselves. Employers should not be required to,42
NA,'carry' employees for whom there is no work be-,42
NA,cause of the industrial action of other employees.,42
NA,"Secondly, stand-down clauses protect employees",42
NA,from being sacked-the y enable the employer to,42
NA,avoid the need to dismiss employees for whom,42
NA,no work is avaUable as a result of industrial,42
NA,"action by others. Thirdly, provision for prompt",42
NA,access by employers to the Commission in appli-,42
NA,cations for stand-down clauses should encourage,42
NA,unionists generally to exert a moderating,42
NA,influence on particular union members and,42
NA,officers who are quick to call strikes rather than,42
NA,use the processes of conciUation and arbitration.,42
NA,A decision to take industrial action all too often,42
NA,gravely affects innocent people not directly in-,43
NA,volved. Any person considering industrial action,43
NA,should be sensitive to the possible consequences,43
NA,of that action for his fellow workers and for the,43
NA,well-being of the community.,43
NA,References to a Full Bench,43
NA,I now turn to the proposed amendments which,43
NA,remedy deficiencies in the Conciliation and Arbirelations,43
NA,tration Act inhibiting the referral of matters,43
NA,full bench ofthe Commission. Those deficiencies welfare.,43
NA,were highlighted during proceedings in the Con-,43
NA,ciliation and Arbitration Commission concerning,43
NA,a claim by the Australian Telecommunication,43
NA,Employees Association for a 20 per cent increase,43
NA,in all wage levels of ATEA members employed,43
NA,by the Australian Telecommunications Community.,43
NA,mission. The Telecommunications Commission these,43
NA,resisted the claim on the grounds that it the,43
NA,conflicted with the principles governing wage,43
NA,indexation. ATEA members then imposed bans,43
NA,and limitations which caused the breakdown,43
NA,the Australian Telecommunications system with,43
NA,very serious social and economic consequences.,43
NA,"Because of the gravity of the situation, it was",43
NA,"essential, in the public interest, that the matter",43
NA,"referred to a full bench. However, there were",43
NA,difficulties in getting such a reference. It is clearly,43
NA,unacceptable that the processes of the Comprotect,43
NA,mission for the proper settlement of industrial,43
NA,disputes should be frustrated because of prowatch,43
NA,cedural deficiencies. It is proposed to remedy,43
NA,those deficiencies by the following amendments,43
NA,to the Act:,43
NA,"First, an amendment to provide that the",43
NA,question whether or not an industrial dispute,43
NA,exists may be the subject of a reference to,43
NA,bench of the Commission.,43
NA,"Second, an amendment to enable an indusadequate",43
NA,trial dispute or part of an industrial dispute,43
NA,be referred to a full bench at the conciliation,43
NA,stage.,43
NA,"Third, an amendment to empower the uals",43
NA,President of the Commission to withdraw a,43
NA,matter from a member of the Commission and,43
NA,deal with it himself by conciliation and/or,43
NA,bitration or refer it to a full bench.,43
NA,Cancellation of Registration,43
NA,For some time now the Government has,43
NA,recognised that in certain situations there,43
NA,need to provide an alternative to the form of,43
NA,deregistration processes presently available,43
NA,under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The,43
NA,need arises from the actions of a few pursuing,43
NA,selfish interests with reckless disregard for the,43
NA,"commumty. Many unions, or sections of them,",43
NA,are strategically placed to interfere with the pro-,43
NA,visions of goods and services to the community.,43
NA,"Indeed, they have used the vulnerability of the",43
NA,community to their disruptive tactics as a power-,43
NA,"ful industrial weapon, and even, on occasions,",43
NA,for blatantly political purposes. The Government,43
NA,does not believe that any member of our com-,43
NA,"munity, whether a direct participant in industrial",43
NA,"or not, should have to put up with tac-",43
NA,"to a tics which threaten their health, safety or",43
NA,We believe that it is proper for all organis-,43
NA,ations effectively to represent the legitimate,43
NA,interests of their members. But these organis-,43
NA,ations also have a responsibility to the com-,43
NA,It is an unfortunate fact that some of,43
NA,"organisations, or sections of them, have in",43
NA,past ignored that responsibility and rejected,43
NA,the proper process for settling their disputes. I,43
NA,need only remind honourable members of the,43
NA,of disruption caused by members of the Transport,43
NA,Workers Union in support of claims for wage in-,43
NA,creases under a number of awards. That disrup-,43
NA,"tion had a dramatic effect, for example, on the",43
NA,be supply of milk and other vital foodstuffs.,43
NA,This Government is concerned about the,43
NA,rights of individuals. We have already acted to,43
NA,the rights of individuals in relation to in-,43
NA,dustrial organisations. We will not stand by and,43
NA,while individual Australians are denied,43
NA,their right to obtain goods and services affecting,43
NA,"their safety, health or welfare.",43
NA,Registration under the Conciliation and Arbi-,43
NA,tration Act confers very significant rights and,43
NA,privileges upon an organisation. It also carries,43
NA,a full with it obligations. The Government believes,43
NA,that the present deregistration provisions are not,43
NA,to deal with the special circumstances,43
NA,"to where organisations, or sections of them, en-",43
NA,"danger the safety, health or welfare of Australian",43
NA,"families. In this context, the existing grounds for",43
NA,deregistration do not sufficiently protect individ-,43
NA,"or the public interest. Accordingly, this Bill",43
NA,proposes that another process of deregistration,43
NA,be provided which will be additional to the exist-,43
NA,aring provisions. I will briefly deal with the main,43
NA,features of the proposed new provision.,43
NA,The Minister may apply to a full bench of the,43
NA,Commission for a declaration that industrial,43
NA,is a action by an organisation or a group of its,43
NA,"members has had, is having, or is likely to have,",43
NA,"a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health",43
NA,or welfare of the community or a part of the com-,43
NA,munity. At this point I ask honourable members,43
NA,to note that it is not any adverse effect due to,43
NA,industrial action that will make an organisation,43
NA,liable to deregistration by these processes; the,44
NA,"adverse effect must be substantial. Moreover, the",44
NA,right to initiate proceedings is restricted to the,44
NA,"Minister, and the decision as to whether the",44
NA,threshold test has been satisfied lies with a full,44
NA,bench of the Commission.,44
NA,Where the full bench makes a declaration the,44
NA,Governor-General may within 6 months direct,44
NA,the Registrar to cancel the organisation's regis-,44
NA,"tration or make orders suspending the rights,",44
NA,privileges or capacities of the organisation or giv-,44
NA,ing directions as to the exercise of any of its,44
NA,"rights, privileges or capacities or for restricting",44
NA,the use of its funds or property to ensure observ-,44
NA,ance of the order. Cancellation of registration,44
NA,need not follow a declaration. If the organisation,44
NA,undertakes not to pursue the industrial action,44
NA,that might be the end of the matter. If it were to,44
NA,"go back on its undertaking, deregistration could",44
NA,be directed at any time up to 6 months after the,44
NA,"declaration by the full bench. After thattime,of",44
NA,"course, the Minister would need to obtain",44
NA,another declaration by a full bench.,44
NA,The orders that the Governor-General may,44
NA,make as an alternative to cancellation of regis-,44
NA,tration are the same as those that may be made,44
NA,as an alternative to deregistration under the,44
NA,existing provision for cancellation of registration.,44
NA,Where such an order has been made it will re-,44
NA,"main open to the Governor-General, within the",44
NA,"next 6 months, to direct that the organisation's",44
NA,registration be cancelled. I remind honourable,44
NA,members that the Acts Interpretation Act pro-,44
NA,vides that a reference to the Governor-General,44
NA,"in an Act shall, unless the contrary intention",44
NA,"appears, be read as referring to the Governor-",44
NA,General acting with the advice of the Executive,44
NA,"Council, that is, with the advice of Ministers. No",44
NA,contrary intention is expressed in these amend-,44
NA,"ments. Consequently, in exercising powers under",44
NA,"the section, the Governor-General will act with",44
NA,"the advice of the Executive Council. Finally,",44
NA,where the Governor-General has directed that,44
NA,"an organisation's registration be cancelled, the",44
NA,organisation cannot be re-registered without the,44
NA,consent of the Governor-General. He may make,44
NA,his consent conditional upon the organisation,44
NA,complying with conditions he prescribes.,44
NA,These new provisions are designed specifically,44
NA,"to protect the job security, safety, health or",44
NA,fare of Australian men and women and their,44
NA,families. They would be used only where these,44
NA,"rights, fundamental to any democracy, are legislative",44
NA,threatened. If any group acts in a way which puts,44
NA,"these rights at risk, then they cannot expect the",44
NA,community to continue granting them the privithe,44
NA,leges to which they would otherwise be entitled.,44
NA,"When the basis oflife is under attack, the public",44
NA,is entitled to expect its Government to protect its,44
NA,interests. Irresponsible behaviour endangering,44
NA,"the very foundation of our society is, fortunately,",44
NA,uncommon. But it does occur and cannot be,44
NA,dealt with by the usual means. This proposed,44
NA,"legislation recognises that fact, and will provide",44
NA,the Government with the necessary procedures,44
NA,to protect its citizens. I commend the Bill to the,44
NA,House.,44

NA,"Bill presented by Mr Adermann, and read a",44
NA,first time.,44
NA,Second Reading,44
Mr ADERMANN ,Fisher-Minister for Vet-,44
NA,erans'Affairs)(12.43)- I move:,44
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,44
NA,"This Bill has two main purposes. Firstly, it pro-",44
NA,poses to give effect to those recommendations,44
NA,which were made by the House of Representa-,44
NA,tives Expenditure Committee which looked at,44
NA,the defence service homes scheme and which,44
NA,were accepted by the Government in November,44
NA,last and require amending legislation. These are,44
NA,the introduction of freedom of choice for,44
NA,beneficiaries in the selection of a house insurer,44
NA,and revision of the long title of the principal Act.,44
NA,"Secondly, it provides for the removal from the",44
NA,Defence Service Homes Act of a number of re-,44
NA,strictive lending conditions. Since the inception,44
NA,"of the scheme in 1919, it has been compulsory",44
NA,for defence service homes to be insured and for,44
NA,the insurance to be effected under the defence,44
NA,service homes insurance scheme. It is proposed,44
NA,to change the legislative provisions so that per-,44
NA,"sons who obtain loans under the scheme may, if",44
NA,"they wish, insure their properties with another in-",44
NA,surer. This proposal follows the Government's,44
NA,decision last year that the insurance scheme be,44
NA,updated to conform with current insurance,44
NA,practice.,44
NA,Honourable members will recall that last,44
NA,"November, the Defence Service Homes Act was",44
NA,amended to authorise the Defence Service,44
NA,Homes Corporation to provide insurance cover,44
NA,"welunder terms set out in a statement of conditions,",44
NA,thereby enabling changes to the terms and con-,44
NA,ditions to be made by administrative rather than,44
NA,process. The statement and any vari-,44
NA,ations to it are subject to the approval ofthe Min-,44
NA,"ister and must be tabled in Parliament. However,",44
NA,commencement of this provision was de-,44
NA,ferred so that the further changes now proposed,44
NA,in clause 9 of this Bill could be incorporated,45
NA,the new arrangements. The proposal in clause,45
NA,enabling beneficiaries under the Act to decide,45
NA,whether to insure their homes with the Corporcal,45
NA,"ation or with another insurer is,",45
NA,to the Corporation retaining the normal rights of,45
NA,a mortgagee. It will be necessary for the home to,45
NA,be insured adequately with an insurer authorised,45
NA,under the Insurance Act 1973 and for the insurer,45
NA,to enter into an agreement of a kind that would,45
NA,protect the Corporation's interests notwithstand-,45
NA,ing any breach of policy conditions by the,45
NA,mortgagor.,45
NA,"As the Act stands, an applicant for an advance",45
NA,cannot insure his home with the Corporation,45
NA,until it has acquired an interest in that home. To,45
NA,ensure that an eligible person is not disadvan-,45
NA,"taged during the waiting period for an advance,",45
NA,"clause 9 authorises the Corporation, if the appli-",45
NA,"cant so chooses, to insure his home during this",45
NA,period. Insurance cover taken out with the Cor-,45
NA,poration in these circumstances will be ter-,45
NA,minated on reasonable notice if it becomes evi-,45
NA,dent that the loan will not be granted. I,45
NA,"emphasise, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the oppor-",45
NA,tunity to insure with the Corporation will be lim-,45
NA,ited to eligible persons to whom it is proposed to,45
NA,make an advance or to whom an advance has,45
NA,been made.,45
NA,The provisions relating to the change in the,45
NA,longtitleof the Act are contained in clause 3. The,45
NA,existing longtitleis to be repealed and replaced,45
NA,by a new title which more accurately reflects the,45
NA,provisions and purposes of the Act. The,45
NA,proposed amendments to the Act to remove cer-,45
NA,tain restrictive lending conditions are set out in,45
NA,clauses 5 and 6. Clause 5 amends section 21 to,45
NA,remove the statutory limitation on the loan to,45
NA,valuation ratio. Clause 6 repeals section 24 which,45
NA,imposes certain hmitations on the discretion to,45
NA,make a loan. The Government is satisfied that,45
NA,these restrictions are not now necessary and be-,45
NA,"lieves, as in the case of insurance, that applicants",45
NA,should have the maximum freedom of choice in,45
NA,the selection of a home. The interests of the Cor-,45
NA,poration will be adequately protected by the,45
NA,amendment of section 25 proposed in clause 7,45
NA,and by other provisions of the Act.,45
NA,The amendment to section 40A proposed in and,45
NA,clause 10 is in keeping with the Audit Amendlast,45
NA,ment Act 1979 and provides for interest on,45
NA,investment of moneys of the Defence Service,45
NA,Homes Insurance Trust Account to be credited,45
NA,directly to that Account. Under the current,45
NA,rangements interest is paid into the Consolidated,45
NA,"Revenue Fund, and this requires a specific parQueensland,",45
NA,liamentary appropriation for an equivalent toria.,45
NA,in amount to be paid to the Insurance Trust,45
NA,9 Account. The remaining provisions of the Bill,45
NA,cover minor machinery amendments of a techni-,45
NA,and administrative nature. I commend the,45

NA,the Northern Territory administration where invalid,46
NA,empensions are payable for the same injury. Clauses,46

NA,agreed to.,47
NA,Clause 5 (Meaning of subversion when not of,47
NA,foreign origin).,47
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith),47
NA,(2.27)- I move:,47
NA,"Clause S, page 3, line 5, omit 'ultimately'.",47
NA,We are commencing a debate on the Australian,47
NA,Security Intelligence Organisation Bill as drafted,47
NA,by the Government. The Opposition is putting,47
NA,forward a series of amendments because the,47
NA,Government is not prepared to draft the Bill,47
NA,other than in its present form. I hope that the,47
NA,Government will give serious consideration to,47
NA,the matters we will mention because we make,47
NA,this contribution in a bipartisan manner. Clause,47
NA,to 5 relates to the meaning of subversion when not,47
NA,of foreign origin. We say that the clause should,47
NA,be amended so as to delete the word 'ultimately'.,47
NA,of There has been a lot of comment on how difficult,47
NA,it is to define subversion. At present the clause,47
NA,in defines subversion in this way:,47
NA,"(a) activities lhat involve, will involve or lead to, or are",47
NA,"or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of",47
NA,or violence or other unlawful acts . . . for the,47
NA,purpose of overthrowing or destroying the constitutional,47
NA,Everybody agrees that any act which has the in-,48
NA,tention of destroying the constitutional govern-,48
NA,ment is subversion. If one gets to the point of say-,48
NA,"ing that an act will ultimately do that, one is",48
NA,really drawing a long bow as to its intent. That is,48
NA,the danger ofthe word 'ultimately'. It enables,48
NA,some value judgments to be made about what,48
NA,"will happen in the long term. In other words, one",48
NA,could imagine that each and every one of us,48
NA,would be prepared to make a prediction but not,48
NA,a judgment. What we are saying is that we want,48
NA,"a judgment, not a prediction. The actions of",48
NA,people have to be directly related to overt activi-,48
NA,"ties from which one can form the view, with ex-",48
NA,"perience and appropriate intelligence gathering,",48
NA,that what is intended is the constitutional over-,48
NA,throw of the lawfully elected government. Mr,48
NA,Justice Hope said:,48
NA,"Subversion is difficult to define, but is nonetheless",48
NA,". . . very real, and may be . . . very",48
NA,dangerous . . .,48
NA,"Of course, if the subversion is very real and very",48
NA,dangerous there must certainly be a fair amount,48
NA,of evidence as to its reality and the dangerous,48
NA,nature of it. To read into that that an. act which is,48
NA,not yet dangerous might well be dangerous in the,48
NA,future requires subjective judgment. We believe,48
NA,that the definition of subversion should be,48
NA,centred on the question of the reality of violent,48
NA,action. It can be confined to that. The word,48
NA,'ultimately' does not assist the security service in,48
NA,conducting surveillance of people who it thinks,48
NA,are reasonably likely to commit violent action. In,48
NA,"other words, one would be expanding the whole",48
NA,concept if one made a prediction or took the view,48
NA,that a person may be likely to cause violent,48
NA,action in the future. There would be a lot of sur-,48
NA,veillance of people and a lot of telephone tap-,48
NA,ping. There would be a lot of interference with,48
NA,the mail and with the human and civil rights to,48
NA,which people are entitled. Under this legislation,48
NA,these rights can be infringed on the basis that,48
NA,people at some stage in the future might be likely,48
NA,to commit violent action.,48
NA,We say that taking out the word 'ultimately',48
NA,would still leave the security service free to con-,48
NA,duct surveillance of people likely to use force.,48
NA,"However, this would not allow it to conduct sur-",48
NA,veillance of people because they might engage in,48
NA,rhetoric or have something in the constitution of,48
NA,their organisation to bring about an ultimate,48
NA,change in the nature of society. People can talk,48
NA,about new ideas of government. They can talk,48
NA,about a better form of government. That is part,48
NA,of the normal democratic process. The omission,48
NA,of the word 'ultimately' would make the clause,48
NA,much clearer and wouuld centre it on the essen-,48
NA,tial concept of violence. As His Honour Mr Jus-,48
NA,tice Hope endeavoured to say: Subversion does,48
NA,mean overthrow and ruin; it does have a direct,48
NA,relation to activity associated with the immediate,48
NA,overthrow of a government. One could get to the,48
NA,point where somebody might say: ' I think that in,48
NA,the future I will run a campaign to get rid of the,48
NA,government that we have at present'. That is,48
NA,rhetoric or a platform about which people in,48
NA,Australia can form a judgment. If the person,48
NA,making those sorts of statements is putting them,48
NA,on the basis that it would only happen with the,48
NA,"support of the majority of Australians, nobody",48
NA,could take objection to them.,48
NA,One has to use this definition clause in a most,48
NA,efficient and very rigid way. We have no objec-,48
NA,tion at all to defining activities that would in-,48
NA,volve or lead to the destruction of a consti-,48
NA,"tutional government, but to use the word",48
NA,'ultimately' brings this mental decision by,48
NA,officers of ASIO as to how they think people or a,48
NA,number of persons may eventually act. That is,48
NA,like a psychiatrist trying to suggest whether any,48
NA,one of us in five to ten years time will be fit to be,48
NA,here or otherwise. None of us would want to be,48
NA,under that sort of a judgment. That is a judgment,48
NA,by people about other people's ultimate inten-,48
NA,tions. It is on that basis that we are suggesting,48
NA,that this legislation would be improved in the,48
NA,public interest-th e thrust of all our amendments,48
NA,is in the public interest-i f the definition section,48
NA,was limited to the extent I have mentioned.,48
NA,There shouuld be a definite sanction as to the,48
NA,people who are to be subject to infringement of,48
NA,their liberties without them knowing. This,48
NA,should centre on those people who are likely to,48
NA,engage immediately in violent action. In our,48
NA,view that would be adequate. It is on that basis,48
NA,that we make the submission in regard to clause,48
NA,5. We hope that there will be some intelligent,48
NA,and rational discussion as to why it should be,48
NA,otherwise.,48
Mr KERIN ,Werriwa) (2.35)- I fully support,48
NA,the remarks made and the amendment moved,48
NA,by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr,48
NA,Lionel Bowen). This provision is so wide that it is,48
NA,singularly dangerous. It is capable of almost,48
NA,"indefinite extension. As it is worded, it would",48
NA,provide an excellent charter for the secret police,48
NA,"of any state, including Pinochet's police in Chile",48
NA,and the KGB. It is all encompassing as it is. The,48
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition is proposing,48
NA,that we remove the word 'ultimately'. By doing,48
NA,that we would at least put some stress back on,48
NA,the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,48
NA,to consider fully the definition of the word 'sub-,49
NA,"version ', which is far too wide.",49
NA,"As it is, it could affect anyone, as we have",49
NA,pointed out during the second reading debate. It,49
NA,"could affect church groups, civil rights groups,",49
NA,"protest groups, minority political groups and, in",49
NA,"fact, any opposition party. It could affect any",49
NA,"Australian who works with, is married to, does",49
NA,"business with, employs, is a friend of, drinks beer",49
NA,"with, attends the same club as, goes to church",49
NA,"with, is a neighbour of or talks to any member of",49
NA,the groups I have just mentioned. The Bill pro-,49
NA,vides for a very wide definition and interpret-,49
NA,ation of the word 'subversion'. The very vague-,49
NA,ness of the definition as it stands also leaves a,49
NA,massive amount of discretion to low grade oper-,49
NA,atives. I stress the term 'low grade operatives' be-,49
NA,cause there is a tendency when speaking of ASIO,49
NA,to feel that all is well because it has a Director-,49
NA,General of integrity in Mr Justice Woodward.,49
NA,The fact is that many decisions on surveillance,49
NA,are made at a lower level and in State branches.,49
NA,"If a low level or low grade officer is given an inch,",49
NA,he will end up by taking a lot more. I think we,49
NA,have abundant evidence of that in what Mr Jus-,49
NA,tice White said following his investigation in,49
NA,"South Australia. Very importantly, we have evi-",49
NA,dence of that also in what the right honourable,49
NA,member for Lowe ( Sir William MCMahon) said.,49
NA,"As a former Prime Minister, he would know",49
NA,exactly what transpired on many occasions in the,49
NA,operation of our security forces. He said again,49
NA,this morning on the radio program A.M. that he,49
NA,knew of occasions when ASIO went beyond its,49
NA,charter.,49
NA,The product of the kinds of attitudes to,49
NA,version contained in this definition leads to the,49
NA,abuses described by Mr Justice White in his rethat,49
NA,port on the South Australian Special Branch,49
NA,"the early 1950s. He said, for example:",49
NA,"After 1953/4, Special Branch files assumed a new dimen-",49
NA,sion of intense interest of Labor opinion and Labor,49
NA,unions. All elected State Labor leaders became subjects,49
NA,"index cards, and sometimes of subject sheets and",49
NA,Interest in extreme right wing organisations dwindled,49
NA,insignificance. Interest in moderate right wing opinion was,49
NA,"virtually non-existent. Interest in centre, moderate",49
NA,ical and extreme left opinion was the main preoccupation.,49
NA,So we know for a fact by the process of judicial,49
NA,"audit, if one likes to put it that way, that ASIO",49
NA,has been overly concerned and has exhibited,49
NA,political bias. A former Liberal Prime Minister-,49
NA,the right honourable member for Lowe-ha s,49
NA,hinted that he knew of this when he was Prime,49
NA,Minister. I believe that we need to remove,49
NA,"word 'ultimately' from paragraph (a) of subaccount,",49
NA,"clause (1) of clause 5 because, as I said at the",49
NA,"outset, it would at least put some pressure back",49
NA,"on to ASIO to be more careful when it handles,",49
NA,when it deals with and when it acts under all the,49
NA,inferences contained in this rather wide-ranging,49
NA,definition ofthe word 'subversion'. The defini-,49
NA,tion is unsatisfactory. It needs to be much more,49
NA,precise. I basically believe that we in this country,49
NA,have a democracy which is robust enough to en-,49
NA,able us to accept precision written into laws,49
NA,which concern security and intelligence and,49
NA,which protect the rights of every Australian per-,49
NA,son. That is what the Opposition in this place is,49
NA,about; we are here to protect civil rights and to,49
NA,protect the rights of every Australian. It should,49
NA,not be hard to compose a form of words that,49
NA,guarantees those civil rights. I believe that if we,49
NA,remove the word 'ultimately' we will go at least,49
NA,some way towards doing that.,49
Mr BARRY JONES ,Lalor) (2.39)- I think,49
NA,that clause 5 is drawn far too broadly. In going,49
NA,through the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary,49
NA,"and looking at the precise wording of that clause,",49
NA,"the words that begin the clause, I find they are",49
NA,far too wide. Clause 5(1) reads:,49
NA,"For the purposes of this Act, the activities of persons-",49
NA,The following words are in parenthesis-,49
NA,other than activities of foreign origin or activities directed,49
NA,against a foreign government-,49
NA,That part can be left out for the purposes of the,49
NA,meaning of the clause-,49
NA,that are to be regarded as subversion are-,49
NA,The clause then sets out the activities in para-,49
NA,"graphs (a), (b) and (c). The point about the",49
NA,definition of the word 'regarded' is that it con-,49
NA,tains an absolutely and totally subjective judg-,49
NA,subment. The clause does not say that those things,49
NA,'are' or 'are to be defined as subversive'; it states,49
NA,they 'are to be regarded as'. What is troub-,49
NA,in ling about this dragnet definition of the word,49
NA,'subversion' and what makes it different from,49
NA,"the definition of 'arson', 'theft', 'rape' or any",49
NA,trade other kind of offence is that all those offences,49
NA,of have an objective element in them. In the case of,49
NA,files. arson something has to be burned down. One,49
NA,"into cannot say: 'Look, notionally, cognitively, I am",49
NA,left radgoing to regard that as a matter of arson. Of,49
NA,"course, nothing has burned down but I choose to",49
NA,regard it as so'.,49
NA,The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary has an,49
NA,enormously long definition of the word 'regard'.,49
NA,I will not inflict the whole of that definition on,49
NA,"the Committee, but the essential sections of it",49
NA,are: To take notice of; to pay attention to; to give,49
NA,"the heed to. Synonyms for 'regard' are: Repute,",49
NA,or estimation. We are not even saying,49
NA,that subversion consists of a particular matter.,49
NA,The definition simply refers to activities which,49
NA,"are to be regarded subjectively, in somebody",50
NA,"else's judgment, as subversion. That is far from",50
NA,"saying that it is subversion, that it is to be defined",50
NA,as a particular offence. The clause goes on to,50
NA,state in paragraph (a):,50
NA,activities that involve . . . or are intended or,50
NA,ultimately to involve or lead to . . .,50
NA,The point again is that that puts in an extremely,50
NA,"subjective judgment, because the word 'ultiMinister",50
NA,"mately' might mean 100 years, 150 years or 200",50
NA,"years, and that could lead to such an extraordiment.",50
NA,narily cautious or repressive view being taken of,50
NA,what is legitimate or illegitimate behaviour that,50
NA,we will find ASIO's powers being extended in,50
NA,way which I think is quite objectionable in a,50
NA,democratic community like ours.,50
NA,"Again, I applaud the amendment moved by spare",50
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Consider,50
NA,the insertion of the word 'unlawful' at the,50
NA,"ginning of paragraph (b), which reads:",50
NA,"activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering",50
NA,with the performance by the Defence Force . . .,50
NA,At least by inserting the word 'unlawful' there,50
NA,we have an objective test rather than purely a,50
NA,subjective test. Paragraph (c) of the clause talks,50
NA,about activities directed to promoting violence,50
NA,hatred between different groups of persons. Not time.,50
NA,one of us would not like to see a reduction in the,50
NA,amount of hatred in the community. I have very,50
NA,grave doubts about whether one can eliminate,50
NA,"hatred by legislation, as much as one might like",50
NA,to do that. I think that is a futile kind of exercise.,50
The CHAIRMAN,Order! Is the honourable,50
NA,member foreshadowing his remarks on the,50
NA,sequent amendments? We are currently dealing,50
NA,with amendment No. 1.,50
Mr BARRY JONES,I confess that I have an,50
NA,"probably strayed to some extent, but I will",50
NA,about the word 'ultimately'. Perhaps I could,50
NA,a brief example to illustrate my concern about,50
NA,the unduly wide range of the definition of the,50
NA,'activities of persons' that are to be regarded,50
NA,subversive. I shall describe a brief incident in my,50
NA,own career. It is the only time to my absolutely,50
NA,certain knowledge that my telephone was that,50
NA,tapped. I am not particularly paranoid about,50
NA,"telephone tapping, but I will relate one particular",50
NA,instance of which I am absolutely sure. It has,50
NA,bipartisanflavourto it because a Liberal MinisBranch,50
NA,ter was involved.,50
NA,"In February 1967, prior to the hanging of",50
NA,"Ronald Ryan, a number of people-no t just activities",50
NA,those in the Labor Party but also those on the,50
NA,other side of politics-wer e concerned about,50
NA,matter. An incident occurred in the middle of,50
NA,night which made me quite convinced that my,50
NA,telephone was being tapped. The sequence of,50
NA,events is as follows: Around midnight on a par-,50
NA,"ticular night a drunk, I think, rang my home",50
NA,number. At the time a number of us were sitting,50
NA,around there wondering what we were going to,50
NA,likely do next. The person on the telephone suggested,50
NA,that there was only one way in which to have the,50
NA,hanging put off and that was to kidnap a Cabinet,50
NA,"or, i f not a Cabinet Minister, some",50
NA,official or senior member of the Victorian Parlia-,50
NA,I was not then in the Victorian Parliament.,50
NA,I replied that I did not think that abduction was a,50
NA,particularly useful activity to engage in and that,50
NA,"a it was not likely to improve the situation, cer-",50
NA,tainly so far as Ronald Ryan was concerned. So I,50
NA,disregarded that completely. A few minutes,50
NA,"later, a friend rang- I think perhaps that I should",50
NA,"his feelings and not name him, but suffice it",50
NA,"to say, he is a Minister in the Victorian",50
NA,beGovernment-t o say that he thought that there,50
NA,was a senior member of the Victorian parliamen-,50
NA,tary Liberal Party whom we ought to go to see,50
NA,"and that if we went to see him, he might be able",50
NA,to have quite a significant influence on the Prem-,50
NA,"ier, Sir Henry Bolte, even at that late stage. We",50
NA,agreed that we would meet at the home of this,50
NA,or senior parliamentarian in about 20 minutes',50
NA,"So at, I suppose, about quarter past one in the",50
NA,morning we arrived independently at his address,50
NA,in a Melbourne suburb. Within a matter of sec-,50
NA,onds a police car had pulled up with its siren,50
NA,going and its blue light flashing. Policemen,50
NA,subjumped out and grabbed us. We both said:,50
NA,'What are you trying to do to us?' My friend was,50
NA,not then a Minister but a State member. The,50
NA,"police said: 'Well, we have reason to believe that",50
NA,attempt is going to be made tonight to kidnap,50
NA,talk a Minister of the Victorian Government or a,50
NA,"give senior parliamentarian'. My friend, now the",50
NA,"Minister, said: 'Turn it up. I am a member of the",50
NA,Victorian Parliament myself. It is extremely un-,50
NA,as likely that we would be involved in that kind of,50
NA,activity'. It seemed quite clear to me that the only,50
NA,way in which a police car could have come with,50
NA,particular story at that particular spot at that,50
NA,particular time was if my telephone had been,50
NA,tapped. It is clear that this was not an ASIO oper-,50
NA,a ation but that somewhere in the State Special,50
NA,in Victoria it was thought: These people,50
NA,are probably engaged in some kind of dangerous,50
NA,"activity, therefore it is necessary to treat their",50
NA,as potentially subversive so far as Vic-,50
NA,toria is concerned and tap their phones. In that,50
NA,the case we behaved with absolutely perfect pro-,50
NA,the priety and in a politically bipartisan way. My,50
NA,friend pursued his political career; I maintained,50
NA,my political interest. But the point is that there,51
NA,"was, I believe, a quite illegitimate police inter-",51
NA,ference in what we were doing. That is the sort of,51
NA,thing that concerns me. That is the only experi-,51
NA,ence I can speak of where I have been personally,51
NA,interfered with. But I do not wonder that there,51
NA,would be many other people in the trade union,51
NA,movement who would be similarly placed. I,51
NA,think that such action is coercive. I do not believe,51
NA,that the State ought to exercise this kind of sur-,51
NA,veillance of people's activities unless there is,51
NA,some kind of prima facie case that there is likely,51
NA,"to be a breach of the peace or some illegal act,",51
NA,"and so on. Even then, I have very great doubts",51
NA,about it. So I believe that we ought to remove the,51
NA,word 'ultimately' because if we do so it means,51
NA,that there has to be some real pre-supposition,51
NA,"that something illegal, something that will dis-",51
NA,"turb the public peace, will happen. It is not",51
NA,enough to rely on the this extraordinary broad,51
NA,dragnet clause wherein we use the word,51
NA,'regarded '- a completely subjective test.,51
Mr KEVIN CAIRNS ,LUley) (2.49 ) - I think,51
NA,the Opposition is showing an unnecessary fear,51
NA,with respect to the word 'ultimately'. Quite,51
NA,frankly I do not understand the concern the,51
NA,position is showing for this word. Reading,51
NA,"through the Senate debates, I suggest that the",51
NA,same kind of concern was shown by the Oppodifficult,51
NA,"sition there, but it never came through in the",51
NA,stance of the propositions the Opposition put,51
NA,ward for the deletion of the word 'ultimately'.,51
NA,course this whole section requires that there,51
NA,judgment. Since there has to be a judgment,51
NA,about an action which has not yet occurred-tha,51
NA,is what we are talking about; the overthrow of a,51
NA,constitutional government-therefor e there have,51
NA,to be difficulties.,51
NA,I turn my attention to the word 'ultimately'.,51
NA,Let me give an example. If a series of actions,51
NA,"take place, which on all accounts can be quite",51
NA,"similar to one another, but one of which has an",51
NA,ultimate intention of bringing about the,51
NA,overthrowing or the destroying of a consti-,51
NA,tutional government of the Commonwealth or a,51
NA,"State, that can be very different from a similar",51
NA,action whose ultimate aim is not to do that. Let,51
NA,me give honourable members an example from,51
NA,"recent history. I choose a strike, not because it",51
NA,"was a strike, but because it is appropriate. When",51
NA,there were the great strikes on the coalfields in,51
NA,"New South Wales during the late 1940s, the",51
NA,"Prime Minister of the day, Mr Chifley, was very",51
NA,concerned. We all know that he took a very de-,51
NA,liberate and unique action in respect of those,51
NA,coal strikes. He was concerned not merely be-,51
NA,"cause it was another strike, but because involved",51
NA,in that strike were quite powerful communist el-,51
NA,"ements, who made no bones of the fact that they",51
NA,intended to alter the nature of government,51
NA,within Australia. So Mr Chifley took quite delib-,51
NA,"erate action. Going back to the earlier strikes, the",51
NA,"great strikes of the 1890s, they were just as effec-",51
NA,tive. They held up economic life in those days,51
NA,just as greatly as did the strikes on the coalfields,51
NA,in the 1940s. But the strikes in the 1890s were,51
NA,Australian strikes about Australian issues and,51
NA,"there was no intention to have, as the final end of",51
NA,"those strikes, a change to the constitutional pro-",51
NA,cess within the States at that time.,51
NA,"Those two actions which, on looking at them,",51
NA,"could be on all fours similar, could have and",51
NA,ultimately were judged to have a different final,51
NA,"aim and end. I suggest, therefore, that to take out",51
NA,the word 'ultimately' would destroy that ca-,51
NA,pacity to make different judgments about those,51
NA,two events because different judgments were,51
NA,made by those in constitutional power and those,51
NA,events were blessed with authority at each time.,51
NA,"To take out the word 'ultimately', I believe,",51
NA,would do a disservice and would betray an un-,51
NA,necessary anxiety on the part of the Opposition. I,51
NA,Opturn it round the other way: If 'ultimately' is,51
NA,taken out and if judgment is to be made as to,51
NA,"what would be a subversive action, is the task too",51
NA,to accomplish? If it is taken out one has,51
NA,subto demonstrate that there is an approximate and,51
NA,foralmost immediate relationship between the,51
NA,Of action contemplated and the revolutionary over-,51
NA,be throw of a government of the Commonwealth or,51
NA,the State. If there is to be an approximate and,51
NA,"t immediate relation between the two, that is a",51
NA,task that is so difficult that it would be almost im-,51
NA,possible to accomplish. The hurdle would be too,51
NA,great.,51
NA,So I suggest that for sound reasons and with-,51
NA,"out having any secondary aim about the word,",51
NA,"'ultimately' ought to be left in. If it is taken out,",51
NA,the task is too great and too impossible to prove.,51
NA,If it is left in one can make an appropriate judg-,51
NA,ment between those who are undertaking a,51
NA,course of action which may have several connec-,51
NA,tions to it and several gradations of incidents to,51
NA,"it, but whose ultimate aim is a revolutionary aim",51
NA,and whose final course of action can be a revol-,51
NA,utionary aim. We ought not to put that prop-,51
NA,osition out of our minds and we ought not to re-,51
NA,move that series of actions from others which,51
NA,would contemplate an appropriate judgment,51
NA,being made as to the action itself. For those,51
NA,reasons I suggest that the word 'ultimately',51
NA,"ought to remain in the clause and, in fact, being",51
NA,"in, it can be a protection as much as anything",51
NA,else.,51
Mr WEST ,Cunningham) (2.54)- I believe,52
NA,that all the clauses up to clause 5 are sympto-,52
NA,matic of what is very dangerous legislation. This,52
NA,is anti-democratic legislation because it simply,52
NA,redefines and widens the Australian Security In-,52
NA,telligence Organisation's powers to collect infor-,52
NA,mation regarding national security. It also legal-,52
NA,ises many previously illegal activities pursued by,52
NA,ASIO which were exposed in the Hope report.,52
NA,But I believe also that because the Hope report,52
NA,"precedes all of this legislation, it ought to be seen",52
NA,also as morally fraudulent because it identifies,52
NA,problems and then relies on ASIO to reform,52
NA,itself from within.,52
The CHAIRMAN,Order! For the benefit of,52
NA,the honourable member for Cunningham I point,52
NA,out that the Committee is presently addressing,52
NA,itself to an amendment proposed to clause 5. In,52
NA,that respect the honourable member is required,52
NA,to address his remarks exclusively to that par-,52
NA,"ticular question; namely, that the word proposed",52
NA,to be omitted stand part of the question.,52
Mr WEST,"With respect, Mr Chairman, I",52
NA,thought that we were dealing with all the clauses,52
NA,"up to clause 5, besides the actual amendment.",52
The CHAIRMAN,Clauses 1 to 4 have been,52
NA,resolved.,52
Mr WEST,Wha t I am attempting to do is to,52
NA,preface my remarks regarding the amendment,52
NA,by dealing with the earlier clauses because they,52
NA,relate to it.,52
The CHAIRMAN,Th e Chair will hear the,52
NA,"honourable member further, but requests him to",52
NA,sustain relevance.,52
Mr WEST,A11 right. I was saying that the,52
NA,conclusions of the Hope report were inadequate,52
NA,"and, since these introductory clauses also follow",52
NA,"the Hope conclusion through, the legislative con-",52
NA,trols over ASIO will also be seen to be inad-,52
NA,equate. I believe that these security organisations,52
NA,ultimately take on a life of their own and auto-,52
NA,matically identify their own interests with the,52
NA,"national interest, which of course they see as the",52
NA,interests of conservative administration which,52
NA,supports their organisations' operation. I am,52
NA,coming to the point in regard to the word,52
NA,'ultimately' and the words to which it relates. Mr,52
NA,"Chairman, I draw your attention to the defini-",52
NA,"tions of espionage, sabotage, subversion, security",52
NA,"and so on, and I then move on to the amendment",52
NA,"to clause 5. Clause 5 (I) (a), in dealing with the",52
NA,'meaning of subversion when not of foreign ori-,52
NA,"gin', reads:",52
NA,"activities that involve, will",52
NA,"or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or",52
NA,violence . . .,52
NA,The definition is the key to the use of the word,52
NA,"'ultimately'. The key words, of course, are 'secur-",52
NA,ity' and 'subversion'. Any definition of those,52
NA,words is very important to the use of the word,52
NA,"'ultimately'. In my belief, the key word is 'secur-",52
NA,"ity'; but one has to examine the question, 'Secur-",52
NA,ity for whom?' before one can examine what is,52
NA,meant by this clause in a definitive way. The very,52
NA,nature of the ASIO beast ensures that security,52
NA,will remain a matter of subjective definition.,52
NA,ASIO lives in the shadows of overseas multina-,52
NA,tionals that control Australia and the structure of,52
NA,the society which incorporates the ASIO creature,52
NA,must be retained if ASIO is to survive. So ASIO,52
NA,"will always oppose political and social change,",52
NA,because such a change challenges its very,52
NA,existence.,52
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,52
NA,member is not at all relevant to the question be-,52
NA,fore the Committee. I must ask him to become,52
NA,immediately relevant or to resume his seat.,52
Mr WEST," Mr Chairman, with respect, what",52
NA,"I am trying to show is that, if we are talking",52
NA,about the word 'ultimately' and what these facts,52
NA,"will ultimately lead to, it is obvious that they will",52
NA,ultimately lead to a threat of subversion or a,52
NA,threat to security. Surely a proper examination of,52
NA,what is meant there must hinge on what is meant,52
NA,by'security' and 'subversion'.,52
The CHAIRMAN,Th e Chair cannot accept,52
NA,the honourable member's argument.,52
Mr WEST,"A11 right. Thank you, Mr Chair-",52
NA,man. I will proceed. The use of the word 'ulti-,52
NA,"mately' implies the use of judgment, and one",52
NA,accepts the argument of the honourable member,52
NA,for Lilley ( Mr Kevin Cairns). The question is:,52
NA,Whose judgment? If one reads the Hope report,52
NA,one will see that Mr Justice Hope was not at all,52
NA,impressed by the calibre of the ASIO agents who,52
NA,would be seen to exercise judgment. I ask,52
NA,honourable members to read the Hope report in,52
NA,that respect. This is the cardinal point on this,52
NA,matter: The use of the word 'ultimately' and,52
NA,what sort of a person is making a judgment on,52
NA,what acts will ultimately lead to further unlawful,52
NA,acts.,52
NA,"As I have said, if honourable members read",52
NA,the Hope report they will see that Mr Justice,52
NA,Hope did not have any confidence in the ability,52
NA,of employees of ASIO to reach such judgments.,52
NA,"That is why, during the late 1960s and early",52
NA,1970s we had the spectacle of ASIO agents,52
NA,placing under surveillance people who marched,52
NA,"in anti-Vietnam demonstrations-clergymen ,",52
NA,"involve or lead to, or are intended",52
NA,academics and trade union leaders-becaus e in,52
NA,their judgment those actions were ultimately,52
NA,bound to lead to threats against security and con-,53
NA,stituted subversion. When the record of ASIO,53
NA,"agents is considered, I suggest that one can have",53
NA,no confidence in their judgment on these matters.,53
NA,If we can have no confidence in the people who,53
NA,"are going to make those judgments, then obvi-",53
NA,ously any word such as 'ultimately' ought to be,53
NA,removed since the legislation needs to be as clear,53
NA,and definitive as possible.,53
Mr RUDDOCK ,Dundas) (3.2)-What has,53
NA,been suggested by the honourable member for,53
NA,Cunningham ( Mr West) is absolute nonsense.,53
NA,The fact of the matter is that the people who he is,53
NA,suggesting should not make a judgment in re-,53
NA,lation to the word 'ultimately' are called upon to,53
NA,make all sorts of other judgments in terms of the,53
NA,other definitions in this clause. Those definitions,53
NA,are quite sweeping. They include an assessment,53
NA,of the following:,53
NA,"activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are",53
NA,or likely-,53
NA,Without the word 'ultimately'-,53
NA,"to involve or lead to, the use",53
NA,lawful acts . . . for the purpose of overthrowing or,53
NA,destroying the constitutional government of the Common-,53
NA,wealth or of a State or Territory;,53
NA,The people who he is suggesting should not do it,53
NA,in case of that one word 'ultimately' are the,53
NA,people who are going to be making the sweeping,53
NA,"judgments, as he alleges, in relation to the bal-",53
NA,ance of that clause and in relation to the whole,53
NA,scheme of this legislation. If he is not prepared to,53
NA,"entrust it in that limited extent to the personnel,",53
NA,why is he prepared to entrust any of these de-,53
NA,cisions to those personnel? Obviously he is pre-,53
NA,"pared to trust them to make those decisions,",53
NA,otherwise he would have voted against the whole,53
NA,scheme of the legislation.,53
NA,Mr Carlton-Whic h he will do in Committee.,53
Mr RUDDOCK,I am not certain about that.,53
NA,Honourable members opposite have indicated,53
NA,general acceptance of the scheme of the legis-,53
NA,lation and the honourable member has accepted,53
NA,that by his votes to date. If he is going to vote in a,53
NA,"different way, if he is going to oppose the clause",53
NA,"entirely and vote against the legislation entirely,",53
NA,that may be another matter. The word 'ulti-,53
NA,mately' was dealt with by the Attorney-General,53
NA,(Senator Durack) in another place and it is per-,53
NA,haps timely that I read out why the Government,53
NA,believes that this word is important. I quote from,53
NA,"the Senate Hansard, where the Attorney-",53
NA,General is recorded as saying:,53
NA,The Government believes that anybody or any organis-,53
NA,ation which believes in and has a commitment to the use of,53
NA,"force or violence at some future stage, even though it may",53
NA,not be engaged in such activities at the moment or may not,53
NA,"even intend to engage in them in the near future, for the pur-",53
NA,poses of overthrowing the constitutional Government of this,53
NA,country should be regarded as subversive and should be kept,53
NA,under surveillance.,53
NA,The scheme of this legislation does not mean,53
NA,anything more than that the security organis-,53
NA,"ation will obtain, correlate and evaluate intelli-",53
NA,"gence relevant to security. So, in relation to the",53
NA,"word 'subversion', again all the personnel are",53
NA,"doing is obtaining, correlating and evaluating",53
NA,information.,53
NA,What honourable members opposite are sug-,53
NA,"gesting is that, because we use the word 'ulti-",53
NA,mately' in relation to our definition of acts that,53
NA,might lead to the overthrowing of our consti-,53
NA,"tutional government, that is an extension of a",53
NA,power which gives an organisation a significant,53
NA,control over the events of men and their lives. Of,53
NA,course that is not the case. The scheme of this,53
NA,intended legislation is to establish an organisation that is,53
NA,"simply going to correlate, evaluate and collect in-",53
NA,formation. I hasten to suggest to honourable,53
NA,of force or violence or other un-,53
NA,"members that, when we are looking at what or-",53
NA,ganisations say they might want to do and per-,53
NA,"haps looking at their constitutions, there is no",53
NA,certainty that they will tell us in an obvious way,53
NA,at all times that their intention is subversive.,53
NA,We have only to look at the Communist par-,53
NA,ties in Europe at the moment. The Italian Com-,53
NA,munist Party seems to be putting aside its objec-,53
NA,tives which it has had for a long time-wit h other,53
NA,Communist parties-ultimatel y to overthrow our,53
NA,systems of government. Now it has changed its,53
NA,tack. It is saying that it is not so concerned with,53
NA,this objective because it wants to win an election.,53
NA,At least we ought to have an awareness of what,53
NA,these parties are about. In making our judgments,53
NA,are we not entitled to look at what ultimately,53
NA,might be their purpose and objective? Now they,53
NA,might be saying that they are not interested in,53
NA,doing such a thing. It was and maybe still is in,53
NA,their platforms but they are putting that objec-,53
NA,"tive aside to create a facade, an image of moder-",53
NA,ation. Should we put aside such considerations,53
NA,and not be cautious when looking at what,53
NA,governments are doing? How can anyone have,53
NA,any objection to a little caution?,53
NA,All that is provided for in this legislation is the,53
NA,"collecting of information-obtainin g it, correlat-",53
NA,ing it and evaluating it according to the functions,53
NA,set out in clause 17. That is the important test.,53
NA,That is all the Organisation is required to to. The,53
NA,word 'security' is defined in the Bill. Clause 5,53
NA,seeks to qualify that definition. That is the,53
NA,scheme of it. It ought to be obvious to all honour-,53
NA,able members that this is not an unreasonable,53
NA,provision. In my view it is certainly not some-,54
NA,thing that can be categorised in the broad and,54
NA,sweeping way that it has been categorised by,54
NA,honourable members opposite. In my view and,54
NA,judgment the clause is deserving of the support,54
NA,of this Committee.,54
Mr HOWE ,Batman) (3.7)- I support the ar-,54
NA,gument that has been put by various members of,54
NA,the Opposition with regard to this clause. Our,54
NA,concern is expressed in this context: Throughout,54
NA,a great deal of Australia's history as a nation-,54
NA,certainly in the postwar period-w e have been,54
NA,pre-occupied with the question of so-called sub-,54
NA,version. I shall quote some of the final sentences,54
NA,of Richard Hall's book on security services,54
NA,which deal with the concern that we have about,54
NA,"this clause. Referring to domestic security, he",54
NA,wrote:,54
NA,It must reject the whole obsession about subversion,54
NA,vated over the past two generations. A free society can and,54
NA,should suppress violence but,54
NA,it is no longer a free society.,54
NA,When one expresses concern about this clause,54
NA,and about the word 'ultimately' within the conis,54
NA,text of the clause I think one is simply trying,54
NA,"underline, in the course of this debate, what",54
NA,been the experience of people who have been,54
NA,associated with all sorts of movements that have,54
NA,come into conflict in our society. They have been,54
NA,labelled by the state or by other sections of,54
NA,ciety as being involved in actions or movements,54
NA,that threaten the whole basis of the state. It,54
NA,seems to me that that problem has been encouncan,54
NA,tered so often in the past. This,54
NA,make some genuine attempt to come to terms,54
NA,with the problem. This clause ought to seek to,54
NA,distinguish between those people who certainly,54
NA,are concerned about transformation or change in,54
NA,"our society in some respect, perhaps in fundacertainly",54
NA,"mental respects, and those people who might",54
NA,classified as violent revolutionaries. Quite clearly,54
NA,this clause does not allow one to make any such,54
NA,"distinction. It refers to 'activities that involve, quite",54
NA,"will involve or lead to, or are intended or likely",54
NA,ultimately to involve or lead to the use of force'.,54
NA,think that the use of the word 'force' as an,54
NA,ditional word to the word 'violence' is open to,54
NA,some question.,54
NA,I had a look at the dictionary of the honourspoke,54
NA,able member for Lalor ( Mr Barry Jones) and I,54
NA,saw that one of the definitions of the word 'force',54
NA,is simply to exert one's strengths to the utmost.,54
NA,Some people in our society passionately believe,54
NA,in causes such as the saving of some rain forests,54
NA,in New South Wales or the prevention of their,54
NA,houses being destroyed by the building of a freewide,54
NA,way. In my own electorate I was involved in a this clause.,54
NA,peaceful demonstration which caused something,54
NA,like 400 police to attend to deal with a relative,54
NA,handful of local residents whose only concern,54
NA,was the construction of a freeway that would de-,54
NA,stroy their homes and pollute their environment.,54
NA,That brought about that kind of display of force.,54
NA,People got the impression that somehow this,54
NA,rather scraggly group of local residents was a,54
NA,group of revolutionaries. They were pho-,54
NA,tographed on that occasion. They were just,54
NA,members of a local group concerned about a par-,54
NA,ticular action that was being taken that would,54
NA,have an effect on their homes and on the environ-,54
NA,ment in which they were living. One can mention,54
NA,many issues-i n a society which is divided on,54
NA,many issues-o n which people have exerted,54
NA,themselves to the utmost to defend their,54
NA,"interests, to push a particular point of view or",54
NA,perspective. Surely within the context of a demo-,54
NA,culticratic society that is their right.,54
NA,when it suppresses free inquiry,54
NA,Yet the use of the word 'ultimately' in terms in,54
NA,which it is used in this clause leads to possibili-,54
NA,"ties. As previous speakers have suggested, there",54
NA,no objectivity in this clause; it provides for a,54
NA,to subjective judgment to be made between,54
NA,has different groups of people as to whether one,54
NA,group of people is ultimately concerned to over-,54
NA,throw the state. Even that requires some defini-,54
NA,tion. I guess that many Australians are concerned,54
NA,soto see some quite fundamental reforms made to,54
NA,"the nature of the Australian state. For example,",54
NA,many would prefer the state to become a republi-,54
NA,state as opposed to being currently a,54
NA,definition ought to monarchy.,54
NA,Mr MCLean-Woul d you?,54
Mr HOWE,Certainly. That point of view,54
NA,involves fundamental changes to the,54
NA,be constitutional government of the Common-,54
NA,wealth and it might be seen by some people to be,54
NA,revolutionary. One can imagine people,54
NA,who advocate that point of view being caught up,54
NA,within this definition of subversion. It is ex-,54
NA,I tremely important in a situation such as this that,54
NA,adthe Parliament attempts to get some real consen-,54
NA,sus on critical terms. Last night when the honour-,54
NA,able member for Lowe ( Sir William MCMahon),54
NA,in the course of this debate he indicated,54
NA,some real dangers associated with the legislation.,54
NA,"He, a former Prime Minister, claimed that he",54
NA,had been denied information by the Director-,54
NA,General of ASIO. That seems to me to indicate,54
NA,that there is deep division within this Parliament,54
NA,"about this legislation. Quite clearly, there are",54
NA,divisions of opinion concerning the effect of,54
NA,In my view this clause has been drawn too,55
NA,wide. Inevitably it will affect groups of people,55
NA,"who certainly have no revolutionary purpose, no",55
NA,purpose whatever to change the nature of the,55
NA,state of this society. But in the terms of this,55
NA,definition their actions may be seen to represent,55
NA,"some kind of threat to the status quo, to the es-",55
NA,tablished order. Under this legislation it is open,55
NA,for people in security organisations to interpret,55
NA,"the actions of such people as actions which will,",55
NA,"in the final analysis, lead to the overthrow of the",55
NA,state-t o the overthrow of the government of the,55
NA,"Commonwealth, of a State or of a territory. It is",55
NA,simply a chain reaction. How much subjectivity,55
NA,can there be in respect of the kind of imaginative,55
NA,judgment that has to be made to determine that,55
NA,"somehow, because of specific action or a set of",55
NA,"circumstances, a person or a group of people rep-",55
NA,"resents a threat? Yet consistently, throughout the",55
NA,"history of this Organisation, that is the sort of",55
NA,judgment that has been made. Time and again,55
NA,"innocent people have been photographed, their",55
NA,telephones have been intercepted and they have,55
NA,been pursued by this Organisation without any,55
NA,evidence whatsoever of their involvement in an,55
NA,attempt to overthrow the State or to produce fun-,55
NA,damental change.,55
NA,That is the history of this Organisation and it,55
NA,set out in the Hope report. That report refers to,55
NA,the dubiousness of the evidence collected and the,55
NA,way that people's lives have been destroyed bewas,55
NA,cause of the existence of the earlier legislation.,55
NA,The situation is not resolved by this legislation.,55
NA,We know that in the past this Organisation has,55
NA,used the legislation in a totally one-sided way.,55
NA,has been used in a way which has been directed,55
NA,at picking up people who are on about social,55
NA,"form, people who are concerned about class",55
NA,"tinction in this society, about inequalities and",55
NA,deprivation of rights.,55
NA,Mr Barry Jones-Aborigina l welfare.,55
Mr HOWE,Peopl e who are concerned about ASIO.,55
NA,such things as Aboriginal welfare and those who,55
NA,are concerned about the deprivation of rights. In,55
NA,the past those people have been picked up by,55
NA,this Organisation and treated as though they,55
NA,were subversives. That sort of thing will happen,55
NA,again if we allow the defintion to remain,55
NA,unaltered.,55
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable be,55
NA,member's time has expired.,55
Mr VINER ,Stirling-Minister for Employresult,55
NA,ment and Youth Affairs) (3.17)-This debate ment,55
NA,today in the Committee of the Whole House,55
NA,completely justifies the decision of the GovernState,55
NA,ment that this forum-the Committee of the,55
NA,Whole House-i s the appropriate and best forum,55
NA,in which to debate this legislation. The other,55
NA,interesting aspect of this debate- I think it will be,55
NA,obvious as the debate unfolds-i s that we will be,55
NA,able to discern those who do not wish to have a,55
NA,security organisation in Australia at all and those,55
NA,who simply desire to improve the structure and,55
NA,substance of the legislation.,55
NA,I thank the honourable member for Lilley ( Mr,55
NA,Kevin Cairns) and the honourable member for,55
NA,Dundas ( Mr Ruddock) for their contributions,55
NA,because they have demonstrated the reason for,55
NA,the prescence of this word 'ultimately' in the,55
NA,definition of subversion. Of course it must be a,55
NA,matter of judgment. From the very nature of the,55
NA,subversive acts intended to be kept under sur-,55
NA,"veillance it must be a matter of judgment, both",55
NA,by the Australian Security Intelligence Organis-,55
NA,"ation as well as by society, because a mixture of",55
NA,"social, political and constitutional elements of",55
NA,the framework of Australian democracy are in-,55
NA,volved. I think this is an important matter to ap-,55
NA,preciate when we are talking about ASIO.,55
NA,One honourable member referred to the Or-,55
NA,ganisation as 'this beast'. I simply say to the,55
NA,honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr West),55
NA,is that ASIO is not a foreign beast like the KGB or,55
NA,even the Central Intelligence Agency. It is a crea-,55
NA,ture of the Australian democratic body politik. It,55
NA,established by a parliament of this country.,55
NA,Let me also remind him that ASIO began under,55
NA,the charter of Prime Minister Chifley in 1949. It,55
NA,was put into legislative form and given the auth-,55
NA,It ority of legislation by the Menzies Government,55
NA,in 1956. In 1974 the Whitlam Government es-,55
NA,retablished the Royal Commission on Intelligence,55
NA,disand Security under the chairmanship of Mr Jus-,55
NA,the tice Hope. This legislation is the product of that,55
NA,Royal Commission. All along the way the Parlia-,55
NA,"ment of this country has been improving,",55
NA,strengthening andtighteningthe framework of,55
NA,Subversion necessarily being a matter of judg-,55
NA,"ment, as the honourable member for Lilley has",55
NA,"pointed out, one cannot limit the judgment of",55
NA,ASIO to conduct presently being committed. One,55
NA,must be prepared to look at what is beyond that,55
NA,"conduct, the end intention of that conduct, the",55
NA,"belief which underlies the conduct, so that it can",55
NA,"said that whatever is happening, whatever is",55
NA,"being done, has, or is likely to have, as the end",55
NA,the overthrow of the constitutional govern-,55
NA,of the country or the destruction of the con-,55
NA,"stitutional government of the Commonwealth, a",55
NA,or Territory. I think the example cited by,55
NA,the honourable member for Lilley is apposite to,55
NA,the matter that we are debating. As he illus-,56
NA,"trated, a strike of one kind may have no subvers-",56
NA,ive element in it at all but a strike of another,56
NA,"kind, such as the great coal strikes of the late",56
NA,1940s led and underwritten by communist el-,56
NA,"ements in this country, had, one could say, as",56
NA,their ultimate intention the overthrow or destruc-,56
NA,tion of the constitutional government of this,56
NA,country.,56
NA,The inclusion of this word 'ultimately' in,56
NA,definition is not merely something that was in,56
NA,"mind of the Government; in fact, it picks up the",56
NA,recommendation of the Hope Royal Comelectricity,56
NA,"mission. Let me, in summary, again point to the",56
NA,basic reasons we believe the definition should,56
NA,"main as it is written in the Bill. We believe,",56
NA,"Hope Commission did, that any body or any ortralians.",56
NA,ganisation which believes in or has,56
NA,ment to the use of force or violence at some,56
NA,"future stage, even though it may not be engaged",56
NA,in such activities at the moment or may not,56
NA,"tend to engage in them in the near future, for",56
NA,purpose of overthrowing the constitutional,56
NA,"government of the country, should be regarded",56
NA,as subversive and therefore should be capable,56
NA,being kept under surveillance by the ASIO.,56
NA,"Therefore, the Government cannot accept the",56
NA,amendment that has been moved by the the,56
NA,Opposition.,56
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith) the,56
NA,(3.25)-Abou t the only advantage in having,56
NA,committee stage debate is that the Opposition,56
NA,gets a chance to reply to the remarks of the,56
NA,ister who is in charge of the legislation.,56
NA,want to place on record that I do not see any real,56
NA,advantage in replying to the remarks that have,56
NA,been made by the Minister for Employment and,56
NA,Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner). We of the Opposition,56
NA,are trying to talk about the drafting of,56
NA,lation. This debate has nothing to do with the,56
NA,Communist Party in Italy and it has nothing to,56
NA,do with the coal miners strike in New South,56
NA,Wales.,56
Mr VINER , I did not mention it.,56
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,The Minister highly,56
NA,praised two Government supporters for their,56
NA,valuable contributions about this question of,56
NA,why the word 'ultimately' should remain in this,56
NA,clause. Let me get to the point of what this,56
NA,Government is about.,56
Mr VINER ,Nobod y mentioned it.,56
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,If i may be permitted Party,56
NA,"to speak without interruption, it is very",56
NA,nificant that the people on the Government side,56
NA,who allegedly were so anxious to be involved,56
NA,voting in favour of this legislation going to a par-,56
NA,liamentary committee for discussion are not,56
NA,present in the chamber today. Obviously they,56
NA,have given it away. I suggest that if we were,56
NA,assembled in a legislation committee we would,56
NA,not have heard the same nonsense that we have,56
NA,heard in the last few minutes. Our argument is,56
NA,about the drafting of the legislation. We are not,56
NA,playing politics. Let us consider what the,56
NA,honourable member for Lilley ( Mr Kevin,56
NA,the Cairns) had to say. Of course there was a coal,56
NA,the mine strike. Something had to be done about,56
NA,that strike because it was affecting the supply of,56
NA,and could have brought the State to a,56
NA,standstill. If the strike had involved the buses it,56
NA,rewould not have mattered. That is the significant,56
NA,as the point. All of those strikers were fellow Aus-,56
NA,They were not all members of some sub-,56
NA,a commitversive group. Far from it.,56
NA,Back in the old days of the 1890s trade unions,56
NA,inhad to be formed to get some rights for the,56
NA,the workers and back in the Industrial Revolution in,56
NA,the early 1820s something had to be done to get,56
NA,children out of the mines. Honourable members,56
NA,of opposite have gone back to the issue of strike,56
NA,action being taken to achieve improved con-,56
NA,ditions. We have had nothing but success since,56
NA,Coal Industry Tribunal was established. We,56
NA,have had no more worries since there has been a,56
NA,better apportionment of what were deemed to be,56
NA,financial resources derived by mining coal.,56
NA,"a By the same token, I would not be anxious to",56
NA,persuade others that people such as the honour-,56
NA,Minable member for Lilley and the honourable,56
NA,1 just member for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock) would be,56
NA,appropriate intelligence officers to keepfileson,56
NA,people whom they think would ultimately be the,56
NA,sorts of people to cause the violent overthrow of,56
NA,the Constitution. They would exhibit all the,56
NA,legisparanoia that has been exhibited today.,56
NA,Mr Ruddock- Ifindthat a reflection.,56
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I withdraw the re-,56
NA,mark if it is objectionable.,56
Mr BAILLIEU ,H e is not speaking to the clause.,56
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I am speaking in,56
NA,reply to the Minister for Employment and Youth,56
NA,Affairs. One person is in charge of the proceed-,56
NA,"ings of this Committee, that is, the Chairman. I",56
NA,would be grateful if there were no more interjec-,56
NA,tions. We have listened to nonsense about the,56
NA,Communist Party in Italy. We do not mind the,56
NA,Communist Party in Australia. We of the Labor,56
NA,can beat it every time. We are involved in,56
NA,sigthe trade union movement. We are out on the,56
NA,hustings doing battle. Honourable members op-,56
NA,in posite only create communists.,56
The CHAIRMAN,Order! I think that the,57
NA,honourable gentleman is straying from the,57
NA,clause.,57
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I may be straying,57
NA,from the clause but I am speaking in reply to,57
NA,what has been said. The other significant point in,57
NA,what was hoped might be an intelligent debate is,57
NA,how we should draft the clause. In the New,57
NA,Zealand security legislation the word 'ultima-,57
NA,tely' is not used in relation to subversion. That,57
NA,legislation refers to illegal action or action by,57
NA,force. It does not use the word 'ultimately'. We,57
NA,are trying to achieve a proper definition of sub-,57
NA,version. The United States legislation does not,57
NA,use the word 'ultimately' in its definition of sub-,57
NA,version. It talks about illegal means prohibited,57
NA,by statute. There is an intelligent way of drafting,57
NA,this clause. I do not know of any other country in,57
NA,the world with statutes dealing with subversion,57
NA,which has drafted such a clause in this way. That,57
NA,is the reason for the Opposition's objection to,57
NA,this clause.,57
NA,"Without straying too far from the clause, I re-",57
NA,mind honourable members that they should bear,57
NA,in mind that His Honour Mr Justice Hope said,57
NA,that the most dangerous groups happened to be,57
NA,the right wing radical groups that existed in this,57
NA,country. They were not mentioned by the,57
NA,Government. Members of those groups are also,57
NA,members of the Liberal Party of New South,57
NA,Wales. We are trying to promote intelligent dis-,57
NA,cussion by the Committee. The discussion will,57
NA,not be intelligent if it is allowed to proceed in the,57
NA,way in which it did on the last occasion. That is,57
NA,"no reflection on you, Mr Chairman. You are en-",57
NA,titled to make the point that people can argue to,57
NA,the extent of proving what the legislation is,57
NA,about. I make the point that I believe in the need,57
NA,for a new Constitution for Australia. I am,57
NA,anxious for people throughout Australia to meet,57
NA,in order to achieve this end. Do honourable,57
NA,members opposite suggest that that is subvers-,57
NA,ive? I do not advocate a republican Constitution,57
NA,but it will not belong to a monarchy either. It will,57
NA,belong to Australia. It is nonsense to say that,57
NA,people who form groups to talk about a new,57
NA,ideal are subversive. What we are concerned,57
NA,"about is violence, illegal acts and the possible",57
NA,overthrow of a constitutional government by,57
NA,force. To take out the word 'ultimately' would,57
NA,still leave us with all the protection we need.,57
NA,We have spent an hour considering one clause,57
NA,of this Bill. We have heard a lot of garbage as to,57
NA,what people in this country have to put up with.,57
NA,The Hope report clearly shows that there are,57
NA,subversive elements in this country but that they,57
NA,are basically within the radical right wing. Many,57
NA,of them try to overthrow governments in other,57
NA,countries. For that very reason we cannot allow,57
NA,certain heads of state to come here. We are,57
NA,anxious to avoid terrorism. We are fully in,57
NA,accord with the principles of ASIO provided its,57
NA,operation relates to our needs. The appendix to,57
NA,"the Hope report indicates that 70,000 assess-",57
NA,ments a year are made on people. Is this worth,57
NA,"while? Effectively, perhaps only 70 are essential.",57
NA,We want to reduce that margin of error. The in-,57
NA,"formation, once collected, can be distributed",57
NA,right across the length and breadth of this land.,57
NA,As was said by the honourable member for Lalor,57
NA,"( Mr Barry Jones), who watches the people who",57
NA,watch us? Who are the custodians of those who,57
NA,themselves are deemed to be the custodians? We,57
NA,are arguing in simple terms that there is no need,57
NA,to retain the word 'ultimately'. Other,57
NA,"democracies, such as New Zealand and the",57
NA,"United States, have not had to do it. We would",57
NA,achieve a better definition by deleting the word.,57
Mr RUDDOCK ,Dundas) (3.30)-The,57
NA,speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,57
NA,"( Mr Lionel Bowen) was, to say the least, disap-",57
NA,pointing. I expect far more of him. I expect him,57
NA,not to indulge in descriptions of honourable,57
NA,members on our side of the chamber in the way,57
NA,in which he does. I expect him to bring greater,57
NA,credit on his office in leading for the Opposition,57
NA,and indicate that he can rise to a higher standard.,57
NA,The sort of innocence with which he has,57
NA,spoken-,57
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,I t is a normal tactic. Talk,57
NA,about the facts.,57
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The Deputy,57
NA,Leader of the Opposition will remain silent. The,57
NA,honourable member for Dundas will address,57
NA,himself to the question before the House.,57
Mr RUDDOCK," Mr Chairman, through you",57
NA,and in response to the remarks of the previous,57
NA,speaker-,57
The CHAIRMAN,Order! There is some mis-,57
NA,conception. A Minister has the right to respond,57
NA,in a debate at any frequency which he deter-,57
NA,mines. Members on respective sides of the,57
NA,chamber do not have the right to respond in a,57
NA,manner other than within their ordinary,57
NA,"entitlement, which requires relevance.",57
Mr RUDDOCK,What I am saying is very,57
NA,relevant to the clause we are debating. We have,57
NA,just been told that if a person advocates a new,57
NA,Constitution for this country or espouses in a,57
NA,peaceful way the establishment of a republic in,57
NA,Australia he will be in conflict with the definition,57
NA,of subversion in this clause. Nothing is further,57
NA,from the truth. There are three parts to the,57
NA,definition. The first deals with activities. The,58
NA,ond deals with the way in which a person carries,58
NA,out an act. The third deals with the purpose of,58
NA,the act. Simply to advocate a new Constitution,58
NA,does not amount to subversion in terms of the,58
NA,three parts of this clause. Honourable members,58
NA,opposite have to understand that. A person has,58
NA,to indulge in activities which will lead to the use,58
NA,"of force, violence or other unlawful acts for the",58
NA,purpose of overthrowing a constitutional govern-,58
NA,"ment. Quite clearly, each of the three parts of this",58
NA,clause have to be satisfied. We have to consider,58
NA,what a person is ultimately likely to do and what,58
NA,"it will lead to in terms of force, violence or other",58
NA,unlawful acts as well as the purpose of such acts.,58
NA,The simple advocating of a new Constitution,58
NA,for Australia would not be subversive in terms of,58
NA,the definition in this clause. The simple advocacy,58
NA,of a republic is not subversive. It is specious of,58
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to suggest,58
NA,that it is or to suggest that we would like to stop,58
NA,his advocating that approach. I am quite happy,58
NA,to listen to his arguments. If he were convincing I,58
NA,would be happy to be persuaded. He has not,58
NA,been convincing to date. That is part of our sys-,58
NA,tem. We are not trying to undermine it. We want,58
NA,to look at the organisations which do not believe,58
NA,in our system. I am happy to talk about organis-,58
NA,ations of the right and any totalitarian organis-,58
NA,ations that do not permit people to have their,58
NA,own points of view.,58
Mr HOLDING ,Ca n you name one from the,58
NA,right?,58
Mr RUDDOCK, I would certainly not sup-,58
NA,port any fascist regime. But I will not accept any,58
NA,suggestion by the honourable member that I,58
NA,might be a fascist. I would not support any totali-,58
NA,tarian regime that does not permit different,58
NA,points of view. I am equally critical of the far,58
NA,Right as I am of the far Left. I am waiting for,58
NA,honourable members opposite to speak equally,58
NA,about the activities of the KGB as they do about,58
NA,the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency.,58
NA,I am waiting for them to look at the activities of,58
NA,that organisation in the same critical way as they,58
NA,look at those of the United States organisation.,58
NA,The United States is a country in which people,58
NA,can speak out. They have an opportunity to ex-,58
NA,press their concerns. We have the same oppor-,58
NA,tunity to do so when participating in this debate.,58
NA,We do not hear about the security organisations,58
NA,in communist countries. We do not hear about,58
NA,what might constitute subversion in those coun-,58
NA,tries and about how their people are denied free-,58
NA,dom of speech. I do not want to be restricted by,58
NA,any organisation that gives us the capacity to re-,58
NA,sist movements that want to take that freedom,58
NA,"secfrom us, regardless of whether they come from",58
NA,the Right or the Left.,58
NA,I am prepared to support a definition which,58
NA,enables us to do what the legislation will permit,58
NA,"us to do, that is, simply to look at those move-",58
NA,ments. That is all we will be doing. It does not en-,58
NA,able them to be arrested and it does not enable,58
NA,them to be taken in charge. If one goes on from,58
NA,that definition as to what is subversion-becaus e,58
NA,it relates to security-an d then looks at where se-,58
NA,curity comes into the functions of the organis-,58
NA,ation one sees that Clause 17 states:,58
NA,(I) The functions of the Organisation are-,58
NA,"(a) To obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence rel-",58
NA,evant to security;,58
NA,"That is what its purpose is. It is to obtain,",58
NA,correlate and evaluate information. The Govern-,58
NA,ment is saying that if organisations have these,58
NA,sorts of subversive objectives-whethe r they,58
NA,want to make them overt in quite and obvious,58
NA,way or hide them in the bowels of their,58
NA,organisation-w e ought to be able to look at,58
NA,them and be able to know what they are doing. I,58
NA,do not see how any reasonable person could,58
NA,object to that approach.,58
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr GILES) -,58
NA,Order! May I just remind the honourable,58
NA,member that the amendment aims to omit the,58
NA,"word 'ultimately'. I am under a disadvantage,",58
NA,having just assumed the chair. Would the,58
NA,honourable member care to return to the point in,58
NA,the remaining time as to why the word should re-,58
NA,main or why it should be removed?,58
Mr RUDDOCK,The word certainly should,58
NA,not be removed. I have given the reasons for,58
NA,that. What has been suggested in debate on this,58
NA,clause is that the arguments of honourable,58
NA,members on this side ofthe House have been in,58
NA,some way irrelevant; in some way they have,58
NA,been extreme; in some way they represent some,58
NA,extreme right wing point of view. I accept that,58
NA,the honourable member opposite was asked to,58
NA,withdraw the remark. He suggested that it,58
NA,evidenced some paranoia on my part in relation,58
NA,to security. I found that suggestion offensive.,58
NA,Quite properly the honourable member with-,58
NA,drew the inference. But the fact of the matter is,58
NA,that in terms of this debate people simply want to,58
NA,"know, and want our security organisation to",58
NA,"know, what is going on in organisations that are",58
NA,subversive. We are defining subversive so the,58
NA,community will know what these organisations,58
NA,are about and what we believe constitutes sub-,58
NA,version so that these organisations can be moni-,58
NA,tored and our community and our Government,58
NA,will be informed through the Australian Security,59
NA,Intelligence Organisation being able to do that.,59
NA,The word 'ultimately' in this context is de-,59
NA,signed to give the organisation the capacity to be,59
NA,"able to monitor those activities, whether the or-",59
NA,"ganisation wishes to hide its objective, whether it",59
NA,wants to try to put it aside in some surreptitious,59
NA,"way, or whether it wants to indicate in an open",59
NA,way that it preaches subversion. It certainly does,59
NA,not-a s has been suggested by honourable,59
NA,members opposite in this debate-preven t,59
NA,people from going out into the community and,59
NA,advocating a different form of democratic,59
NA,government. That was the suggestion. Honour-,59
NA,able members opposite were suggesting that,59
NA,there was some fear that they should not or that,59
NA,they would be constrained not to go out and ad-,59
NA,vocate a republic and that we do away with our,59
NA,monarchial system. They felt that they might be,59
NA,restricted in some way from going out to advo-,59
NA,"cate, as a result of events that have taken place in",59
NA,"this country, that there ought to be a different",59
NA,form of constitution. It is quite clear from the,59
NA,definition in clause 5 (1) (a) that they would not,59
NA,be prevented. The scheme of the legislation,59
NA,would not prevent them from doing it in any,59
NA,event because the scheme requires the organis-,59
NA,ation only to evaluate and collect information. I,59
NA,do not see how honourable members opposite,59
NA,"would be worried about that, in any event. The",59
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel,59
NA,Bowen) would probably send ASIO a copy ofhis,59
NA,"speeches, I imagine, as he is so proud of what he",59
NA,has to say.,59
NA,How can one be afraid of advocating a course,59
NA,like that and be concerned-eve n if one could,59
NA,extend the wording in a way in which the OppoAustralian,59
NA,sition has suggested-o r scared of some organisgentleman,59
NA,ation monitoring one's activities in support of,59
NA,that point of view? The Opposition ought,59
NA,proud of the position it is taking if it really be-,59
NA,lieves it. I think that is the point of the matter.,59
NA,Whilst I would not want to be unparliamentary I,59
NA,suggest that if there is any paranoia in relation,59
NA,these matters it is not on this side of the House.,59
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr GILES) - tice,59
NA,Before I call on anyone I remind the Committee,59
NA,that the honourable member for Dundas ( Mr clear,59
NA,Ruddock) really spoke during the major part,59
NA,"his speech on clause 5 itself, which is the meanlook",59
NA,ing of subversion when not of foreign origin.,59
NA,"viously in debating clause 5 I , from the chair,",59
NA,must allow some reference to that. What I am,59
NA,anxious to have honourable members do in he stated:,59
NA,future speeches- I am at a disadvantage in that I,59
NA,have just assumed the chair-i s to try to inform false,59
NA,the Committee why the word 'ultimately',59
NA,or should not remain in the clause. That is what,59
NA,the amendment is all about.,59
Mr HOLDING ,Melbourne Ports) (3.40)-If,59
NA,"one were to approach this clause in another way,",59
NA,could any member of the Government say: 'If we,59
NA,were in fact to accept the amendment so that the,59
NA,words 'likely ultimately' were omitted from the,59
NA,"Bill, would we seriously jeopardise the functions",59
NA,and the activities of the Australian Security Intel-,59
NA,ligence Organisation?'. That would leave a,59
NA,definition section of subversion which states:,59
NA,"Activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are",59
NA,"intended to involve or lead to, the use of violence or other",59
NA,unlawful acts for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying,59
NA,the constitutional government ofthe Commonwealth.,59
NA,I believe that if the clause were worded in that,59
NA,way that would be a sufficiently wide mandate to,59
NA,enable ASIO to properly discharge its respon-,59
NA,sibilities to the Government and to the people of,59
NA,Australia.,59
Mr GRAHAM ,Wha t is the difference?,59
Mr HOLDING, I will tell the honourable,59
NA,member what the difference is. Even though we,59
NA,might want to be preoccupied with the KGB or,59
NA,"the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I think our",59
NA,responsibility has to be with our own intelligence,59
NA,Organisation. One cannot judge the activities of,59
NA,that organisation in a vacuum or on a basis of,59
NA,what it is going to do or is likely to do in the,59
NA,future. One has to look at the historic back-,59
NA,ground of that organisation. Looking at the,59
NA,"background of ASIO, no member of Parliament",59
NA,can say that in the past it has not abused its pre-,59
NA,"rogatives and has not-i n many cases wrongly,",59
NA,on a number of occasions illegally-jeopardise d,59
NA,the fundamental rights of many thousands of,59
NA,citizens. I do not ask the honourable,59
NA,to accept my word for that. I ask him,59
NA,to look at all the independent judicial inquiries,59
NA,to be which have examined the record.,59
Mr GRAHAM ,The y do not state that at all.,59
Mr HOLDING, I am sorry if the honourable,59
NA,to gentleman takes that view. Obviously he has not,59
NA,looked at the detail of the Hope report. If he,59
NA,looks at the Hope report he will find that Mr Jus-,59
NA,Hope referred quite specifically to numerous,59
NA,"occasions on which, for reasons which he made",59
NA,"in his report, he was not prepared to enu-",59
NA,of merate. I remind the honourable gentleman to,59
NA,at the details of thefindingsof Mr Justice,59
NA,ObWhite in South Australia. Could there be any,59
NA,stronger indictment than the fact that he,59
NA,"indicated he looked at some 41,000 dossiers and",59
NA,"I have seen a number of cards where information, patently",59
NA,to my knowledge has been used to the attempted disad-,59
NA,should vantage of certain persons . . .,59
NA,Can one have a stronger finding than that?,60
Mr GRAHAM ,Ho w can something be patently,60
NA,false to his knowledge if he does not,60
NA,and why?,60
Mr HOLDING, I am delighted to have that term,60
NA,interjection. I was not wanting to take up the,60
NA,"time of the House, but let me inform the honourvirtually",60
NA,able gentleman that Mr Justice White did exin,60
NA,plain. This is what he said:,60
NA,My perusal of Special Branchfilesshows that,60
NA,dreds of people have done nothing more than take an,60
NA,pan in many causes which ume and changing opinion,60
NA,usually proved them to be right . . . campaigns,60
NA,against involvement in the Vietnam war or conscription,60
NA,"the purposes of that war, the importance ofthe environment",60
NA,and ecology and so on.,60
NA,Then he states:,60
NA,They are the kinds of activities that active persons,60
NA,social conscience and a vision of a better Australia are en-,60
NA,titled to be involved in without the brand of suspected,60
NA,subversion . . .,60
NA,Let me take the honourable member for Dundas,60
NA,"( Mr Ruddock) back to the situation when, in",60
NA,"own State, in Melbourne, some hundred thouthat",60
NA,"sand people, by virtue of their view of a former",60
NA,"government's involvement in the Vietnam war,",60
NA,"and by virtue of their view about conscription,",60
NA,"marched as was their right. When they marched,",60
NA,the Leader of the Liberal Party in this House,60
NA,"accused them of being pack raping bikies, raping",60
NA,democracy. I ask the honourable gentlemen opdossier.,60
NA,posite to look back to their,60
NA,Did they not say that there would be blood,60
NA,flowing down the streets of Melbourne? Was,60
NA,there not going to be violence and were not the,60
NA,whole constitutional foundations of our democmember,60
NA,"racy threatened? Of course, that is what they said",60
NA,and the Hansard record shows that they not only,60
NA,said it but also believed it.,60
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Order! Once been,60
NA,"again, I think I had better drag the honourable",60
NA,member for Melbourne Ports back to a disinvolved,60
NA,cussion of the word 'ultimately'.,60
Mr HOLDING, I was just coming back to,60
NA,that very point. I am referring to an historic situacts.,60
NA,ation where it was the considered view of the,60
NA,people who now comprise this Government that,60
NA,that sort of action was undermining the whole,60
NA,democratic system and there was no way that,60
NA,such action by a citizen would not fall within,60
NA,definition.,60
Mr GRAHAM ,Tha t is nonsense.,60
Mr HOLDING," I am sorry, I do not know citizen",60
NA,how to put it to anyone as dense as the honourganisation,60
NA,able member. I keep trying.,60
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Order! The,60
NA,honourable member for Melbourne Ports will,60
NA,not use extravagant language that may impute,60
NA,explain how the goodwill of another member.,60
Mr HOLDING," I withdraw that, Sir. The",60
NA,'likely ultimately' is so wide that it involves,60
NA,a substantive political judgment which covers,60
NA,any form of legitimate political activity,60
NA,"this community. For example, one of my col-",60
NA,leagues might decide to hold a street corner,60
NA,many hunmeeting in order to speak against some of the,60
NA,active policies of this Government and he might get a,60
NA,have large audience. I have heard someone as mild,60
NA,for and gentle as the honourable member for,60
NA,Capricornia (Dr Everingham) being accused in,60
NA,such circumstances of inciting the people in,60
NA,Queensland to violence. The point is that we,60
NA,should not give our security intelligence forces,60
NA,with a responsibilities for legal interpretations which by,60
NA,their very nature must involve some subjective,60
NA,"analysis as to whether there has been force, or",60
NA,"whether the actions in question, are an essential",60
NA,part of the political fabric of the particular or-,60
NA,"my ganisation which is under scrutiny, and use of",60
NA,force is part of the ongoing methods that,60
NA,they regard as both legitimate and proper. Use of,60
NA,the term 'likely ultimately' means that a whole,60
NA,range of very normal political activities and citi-,60
NA,zens who are involved in normal political activi-,60
NA,ties can be encompassed in that definition and,60
NA,because of that can be the subject of a security,60
NA,That is the thrust of the Opposition s,60
NA,positions at that time. argument.,60
NA,Mr Ruddock-N o way.,60
Mr HOLDING, I ask the honourable,60
NA,for Dundas whether he has not been in-,60
NA,volved in such political situations. He may have,60
NA,been speaking on a street corner- I do not know,60
NA,whether he does things like that-o r he may have,60
NA,speaking at a heavy meeting of his party's,60
NA,State council. Can he say that he has never been,60
NA,in a situation that was 'likely ultima-,60
NA,tely' to involve the use of force?,60
NA,"Mr Ruddock-Us e of force, violence or illegal",60
Mr HOLDING, I do not want to go into the,60
NA,internal details of the Liberal Party. I believe,60
NA,that the omission of this particular clause would,60
NA,not neuter the Australian Security Intelligence,60
NA,"this Organisation, lt would give that organisation a",60
NA,very legitimate and proper charter. There is no,60
NA,compelling reason for parliamentarians having,60
NA,to balance the rights of the ordinary Australian,60
NA,and the rights of a security intelligence or-,60
NA,or to make any presumption in favour,60
NA,of that organisation as against the rights of the,60
NA,Australian citizen. That is what it comes down to.,61
NA,I believe that the first duty of any government in-,61
NA,strumentality or any government police force is,61
NA,to preserve and enhance the rights of the Aus-,61
NA,tralian citizen. Legislation which by its very,61
NA,definition tends to reduce the rights and liberties,61
NA,of the Australian people is bad legislation. This,61
NA,clause is too widely drafted. I support the argu-,61
NA,ment which has so ably put by the Deputy,61
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, the honourable",61
NA,member for Kingsford-Smith ( Mr Lionel,61
NA,Bowen).,61
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, I remind the the,61
NA,Committee once again that we are debating an,61
NA,amendment proposed by the Opposition to rereport,61
NA,move the word 'ultimately' from the clause. I,61
NA,insist that honourable members devote the mais,61
NA,jority of their speeches to debating whether,61
NA,should or should not be in the clause. There,61
NA,one thing I must say to the honourable member,61
NA,"for Melbourne Ports. I did not interrupt him,",61
NA,being a gentle soul like the honourable member,61
NA,"for Capricornia, but I will not allow him to",61
NA,tinue talking while I am speaking from the Chair.,61
NA,That applies to the House generally.,61
Mr DONALD CAMERON ,Fadden) the provisions,61
NA,(3.51)-Som e one and a half hours have passed,61
NA,since discussion commenced on the meaning,61
NA,the effects of the words 'likely ultimately'.,61
NA,there was an example of how wise it would be to,61
NA,have a discussion in a legislation committee,61
NA,stead of holding up the entire proceedings of the,61
NA,"Parliament, this is most certainly it. Unfortuthan",61
NA,"nately, that battle was lost last night when",61
NA,Government in its wisdom decided that everyitical,61
NA,thing was going to be done in this chamber.,61
NA,Given the fact that the Australian Labor Party,61
NA,"proposes 11 pages of amendments, we could well",61
NA,be here for two years. I have listened to the,61
NA,"bate very carefully, in this chamber, or",61
NA,office. I have listened to the cut and thrust,61
NA,both sides of the House. I was deeply impressed,61
NA,by the sincerity of the arguments put by the,61
NA,honourable member for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock).,61
NA,I was equally impressed by the arguments put by,61
NA,"members on the other side of the House,",61
NA,although there are some weaknesses in those,61
NA,arguments.,61
NA,The point is that the words 'likely ultimately'-,61
NA,just two words-hav e become a stopping stage so,61
NA,early in the Committee stage of the debate. I,61
NA,see why the Government wants to safeguard,61
NA,against possible events; I can see why the,61
NA,Government wants to allow the security organiswas,61
NA,ation to place interpretations on likelihoods;,61
NA,I can also understand the fear of some of the,61
NA,"members opposite, that when this definition",61
NA,left in the hands of those who do not answer to,61
NA,even the Parliament it is possible that that defini-,61
NA,tion could be wrongly interpreted.,61
Mr VINER ,"The y do answer to the Parliament,",61
NA,through the Attorney-General.,61
Mr DONALD CAMERON,Answer to the,61
NA,Parliament? The Deputy Chairman will not,61
NA,allow me to deviate from those two words but I,61
NA,remind the Minister for Employment and Youth,61
NA,Affairs ( Mr Viner) that all the Director-General,61
NA,has to do is to give a little report to the Leader of,61
NA,Opposition and to the Minister. It is not even,61
NA,specified how detailed that report must be. That,61
NA,might exclude everything of importance.,61
NA,will The Minister's remark was very provocative. He,61
NA,causing me almost to fall into the trap whereby,61
NA,it the Deputy Chairman will bring me to order. Far,61
NA,is be it from me to want to attract his wrath.,61
NA,"I do not want to wander away from the clause,",61
NA,but I believe that if we are not to make amend-,61
NA,ment to the Act we must ensure that we have a,61
NA,congroup comprising members from the Opposition,61
NA,and from the Government parties with whom the,61
NA,Director-General will consult annually as to how,61
NA,of the Act are being enacted. That,61
NA,would allay much concern. Many of the pro-,61
NA,and posals being put forward by the Opposition,61
NA,If ever would probably be abandoned if the Govern-,61
NA,ment would agree to this point. The fear which is,61
NA,inbeing expressed in this discussion today-,61
NA,perhaps it is more obvious to the listening public,61
NA,it is to members of this House-i s the fear of,61
NA,the the unknown. Perhaps the Government sees pol-,61
NA,advantage in having the Opposition con-,61
NA,tinually offside with the Australian Security In-,61
NA,telligence Organisation. I believe that the,61
NA,protection of the security of this nation is way,61
NA,deabove the level of politics. I hope that the,61
NA,in my Government will accommodate the reasoned,61
NA,from views of members on both sides of the House,61
NA,and not simply dismiss them out of hand.,61
Mr BARRY JONES ,Lalor) (3.55)- I want to,61
NA,take up the point made by the now absent,61
NA,honourable member for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock).,61
NA,I think that he completely misread the clause.,61
NA,Clause 5 (1) (a) is capable of being read in sev-,61
NA,"eral ways. It can be read narrowly, which is the",61
NA,"way he chose to read it, that is that before the",61
NA,Australian Security Intelligence Organisation re-,61
NA,can gards activity as subversive there were to be,61
NA,three elements. The first was activities which,61
NA,were deemed to have a likely result; the second,61
NA,violence; and the third was the purpose of,61
NA,but overthrowing a constitutional government. It is,61
NA,"also possible to read that same clause, with its",61
NA,"is preamble, in a broad way. That broad way can",61
NA,be read to encompass activities that are 'likely,62
NA,ultimately' to 'involve or lead to the use of,62
NA,force . . . by others'. Now that 'ultimate',62
NA,and the'use of force . . . by others'brings,62
NA,us to a situation that must be fresh in the minds,62
NA,of many honourable members.,62
NA,We can take the case of the recent Brisbane,62
NA,street marches. They have involved the use of,62
NA,force-th e use of force by others. In this case the,62
NA,others were the Queensland police. One could se-,62
NA,cure the opinion-an d it would be entirely sub-,62
NA,"jective, I remind the honourable member for",62
NA,North Sydney ( Mr Graham)-o f the Premier of,62
NA,Queensland. What if we had asked him his,62
NA,"opinion, subjectively, or Mr Russell Hinze or Mr",62
NA,"Charles Porter, other distinguished ministers in",62
NA,Queensland? What if we had asked this ques-,62
NA,tion: 'Do these street marches constitute a threat,62
NA,to the established constitutional government of,62
NA,Queensland?' I have little doubt they would,62
NA,have said: 'Yes'. Nobody knows that better than,62
NA,the honourable member for Lilley ( Mr Kevin,62
NA,Cairns). A coach and horses can be driven be-,62
NA,tween the narrow definition which was put up by,62
NA,the honourable member for Dundas and the,62
NA,broad definition which is just as fair and can be,62
NA,just as reasonably read into the Act.,62
NA,This clause constitutes a very bad double. First,62
NA,"of all, the context in which this clause appears is",62
NA,that the activities of ASIO are to be exempt from,62
NA,scrutiny. The other leg of the double is that drag-,62
NA,net powers are provided. When honourable,62
NA,members are dealing with this situation I wish,62
NA,that they would give a specific example in an,62
NA,Australian context of what they would regard as,62
NA,subversive activity. If they could give just one,62
NA,example of a subversive activity-,62
Mr GRAHAM , I will give one.,62
Mr BARRY JONES,I look forward to hear-,62
NA,"ing the honourable member for North Sydney,",62
NA,as I always do.,62
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr GILES) -I,62
NA,wonder whether the honourable member for,62
NA,Lalor could explain to the Chair how the re-,62
NA,moval of the word 'ultimately' will affect the sort,62
NA,of argument he is putting forward. It seems to be,62
NA,what the discussion is about.,62
Mr BARRY JONES,Yes. The question of,62
NA,'ultimately' is that it can be argued that it gives,62
NA,ASIO a dragnet power. I could say to the honour-,62
NA,"able member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), i f he",62
NA,does not object to the example:' We are scrutinis-,62
NA,ing your activities'. He says: 'But I did not intend,62
NA,any harm or violence'. The answer then is to say:,62
NA,"'Yes, but you perhaps could not foresee what the",62
NA,ultimate effect of it was'. He says: 'What do you,62
NA,"mean by ultimate?' I say: 'Of course, it could",62
NA,"have an ultimate effect 10, 15 or 25 years in the",62
NA,future'. He says: ' I did not know that'. I say:,62
NA,"'Yes, but we have the power to deal with what",62
NA,we believe is ultimately going to happen'.,62
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-Likel y to happen.,62
Mr BARRY JONES,"A11 right, 'ultimately",62
NA,likely' to happen in the subjective judgment of,62
NA,somebody. I would not mind accepting the judg-,62
NA,ment of the present Director-General of security,62
NA,"as to how that might be read, or the judgment of",62
NA,"Mr Justice Hope or somebody like that. But if, by",62
NA,"some extraordinary act, the Minister for Employ-",62
NA,ment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) were,62
NA,appointed the next Director-General of,62
NA,ASIO-,62
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns- A very good choice.,62
Mr BARRY JONES,I am not so sure it,62
NA,would be such a wonderful choice although he,62
NA,could hardly do worse than he is doing now. But,62
NA,nevertheless one would be very apprehensive,62
NA,about his definition of what 'ultimately' might,62
NA,"be. I think it has a dragnet effect. Mr Chairman,",62
NA,there was some discussion before you came in. I,62
NA,think that for the purpose of this argument you,62
NA,would agree that the words of preamble in clause,62
NA,5(1) have to be read concurrently with clause,62
NA,5 ( l ) ( ) - We have been given no specific,62
NA,a,62
NA,example of the kind of subversion which might,62
NA,legitimately be regarded as being within ASIO's,62
NA,field. The examples that have been quoted be-,62
NA,"fore, such as urban terrorism in Italy, the Sude-",62
NA,"tenland in 1938, the Profumo case in Britain and",62
NA,"other cases, are very remote from the Australian",62
NA,experience. I think we have a very homogenous,62
NA,society on a whole number of social issues but,62
NA,"not on economic issues, perhaps. We would all",62
NA,be in the debt of the Government if somebody,62
NA,could provide a specific example or two of what,62
NA,ASIO is going to fight against.,62
NA,Another problem is that we know so little,62
NA,about ASIO's track record. Since 1949 ASIO has,62
NA,produced virtually a nil return. I would like,62
NA,somebody on the other side of this chamber to,62
NA,"give us one example of one ASIO triumph, a",62
NA,single ASIO success since 1949.1 think it is no ac-,62
NA,cident that the members of ASIO are known as,62
NA,'spooks' because essentially they are ghost,62
NA,hunters pursuing paranoid nightmare fears. Cen-,62
NA,turies ago people were readily persuaded that,62
NA,witches really existed and the name 'witchhunt',62
NA,has a pejorative significance which has a deeply,62
NA,rooted historical origin. We know that members,62
NA,of ASIO have had enormous success in picking,62
NA,targets such as school cadets for example. They,62
NA,are very good there. They have been pretty good,62
NA,in surveilling street marches. But how do they,63
NA,operate in the big league?,63
NA,I remember something that a former President,63
NA,"of the United States, Lyndon Johnson, said",63
NA,about some of the Kennedy camp followers. He,63
NA,"said 'They could not pour' something or other,",63
NA,"which escapes me at the moment, 'out of a boot,",63
NA,even with the instructions printed on the heel'. I,63
NA,think that is a fair description of ASIO. It seems,63
NA,to be an absolutely incompetent organisation,63
NA,from what we can learn about it. If in fact ASIO,63
NA,has succeeded in saving this country from sub-,63
NA,version and revolution in the last 30 years then,63
NA,somebody on the other side ought to be able to,63
NA,get up and timidly squeak out some evidence. I,63
NA,hope the honourable member for North Sydney,63
NA,will take up that opportunity.,63
Mr GRAHAM ,North Sydney) (4.2)- I can-,63
NA,not resist the immaculate charm and intellectual,63
NA,superiority which exudes from the honourable,63
NA,member for Lalor ( Mr Barry Jones). Having on,63
NA,past occasions listened to him on the radio and,63
NA,"watched him on television, I am aware of the ac-",63
NA,quisitions that are the result of his great capacity,63
NA,and I want to congratulate him. I want to say that,63
NA,I am absolutely intent upon giving him the cases,63
NA,to which he referred. I know that the honourable,63
NA,gentleman is gifted. I know that he can read and,63
NA,"I know that he will study the cases, for example,",63
NA,of those people who in the early days of the,63
NA,Labor Government of Mr Curtin attracted the,63
NA,attention of the right honourable member for,63
NA,Barton who was the honourable Dr H. V. Evatt. I,63
NA,know he will know of the gentleman known as,63
NA,the 'Publicist' and the man named P. R.,63
NA,Stephensen. I would have thought that the,63
NA,honourable member for Lalor would have,63
NA,needed to be on this side of the House in the con-,63
NA,text of this debate had he needed to deal with the,63
NA,activities of the government of the day and the,63
NA,way in which it did deal with those people. He,63
NA,may like to know that they were given no oppor-,63
NA,tunity of explaining their activities. Assumptions,63
NA,were made in relation to their guilt. I understand,63
NA,that they were cast into durance vile for a par-,63
NA,ticular time with all of the contumely that could,63
NA,be heaped upon them by those gracious,63
NA,members of the Australian Labor Party.,63
NA,"Mr Barry Jones-Tha t is a very bad example,",63
NA,I agree.,63
Mr GRAHAM,I do thank the honourable,63
NA,"member for his comment. Furthermore, I would",63
NA,like to say that in the years before I came to,63
NA,"place, in 1946-49, after most of us had returned",63
NA,from a distressing experience that lasted from,63
NA,"1939 to 1945, there were periods when the",63
NA,Government of this country led by the right,63
NA,"honourable member for Macquarie, the late Mr",63
NA,"J. B. Chifley, had judgments that there were",63
NA,"people in this country seeking, as they said in the",63
NA,Parliament-i t can be read in Hansard-t o,63
NA,ultimately confuse the people and to destroy the,63
NA,economy. I say to the honourable member for,63
NA,Lalor that he should go into the Parliamentary,63
NA,Library and look at the editions of the Sydney,63
NA,Morning Herald for that period. By the heavenly,63
NA,"mass, I assure him that if he does he will find a",63
NA,full page edition of an advertisement which says,63
NA,that communism is an attempt ultimately to de-,63
NA,"stroy the Australian economy, and that it is a",63
NA,"connivance, a conspiracy and a horrible, mon-",63
NA,strous attempt to destroy Australia. At the bot-,63
NA,tom of that page he will find the names Joseph,63
NA,Benedict Chifley and Herbert Vere Evatt.,63
NA,If the honourable gentleman is so junior and,63
NA,so lacking in what might be described as those,63
NA,maturities which one hopes will eventually,63
NA,"emerge, besides his hirsute qualities, he would",63
NA,not know these facts. The Deputy Leader of the,63
NA,Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) knows about,63
NA,them because he was a distinguished member of,63
NA,the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. If,63
NA,"I may say with very great respect, the Premiers of",63
NA,that State at that time-no t men of my own pol-,63
NA,itical persuasion; men like Mr MCGirr and Mr,63
NA,Cahill-ha d very definite views. I am led to be-,63
NA,"lieve, if I may say so, that it was only because of a",63
NA,co-ordination of the views of Mr Cahill when he,63
NA,was the Premier of NSW and certain dis-,63
NA,tinguished gentlemen with greater appreciation,63
NA,in higher places than this place that certain,63
NA,events that occurred in Victoria did not occur in,63
NA,"New South Wales. If I use three letters, the dis-",63
NA,tinguished honourable member for Lalor may,63
NA,"understand what I mean. I refer to the letters D,",63
NA,L and P.,63
NA,In those circumstances I am quite sure that it,63
NA,would be realised that the use of the word,63
NA,'ultimately' is important. The fact of the matter is,63
NA,this: If one does not look at organisations and en-,63
NA,visage them as being in due course led into a situ-,63
NA,ation in which they can create problems then one,63
NA,does less than justice to the duties of the Aus-,63
NA,tralian Security Intelligence Organisation. If,63
NA,there were people in 1937 and 1938 who could,63
NA,have envisaged the fact that Philby was to be-,63
NA,come an active member of a government that,63
NA,was totally against the welfare of the govern-,63
NA,"ment of the United Kingdom, is it the judgment",63
NA,this of members of the Opposition that that ought not,63
NA,have been stated in some paper about him? Is it,63
NA,their view that i f people such as Burgess and,63
NA,MCLean exist in the Australian civil service they,63
NA,should be protected? Do they not understand,64
NA,anything at all about ASIO? Do they not under-,64
NA,stand that the welfare of their nadon is protected,64
NA,directly in ratio to the significance ofthe national,64
NA,security organisation? Have they no historical,64
NA,knowledge of their own political party? I suggest,64
NA,that they go back to 1942 and read what their,64
NA,party and its leaders said when Yamashita cap-,64
NA,tured Singapore. I have the honour to tell them,64
NA,that what they read will not make them proud,64
NA,men.,64
Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (4.9)- I do not think,64
NA,that the justification for the Opposition's case,64
NA,could be more eloquently put than it was put by,64
NA,the honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr,64
NA,Graham). The people he mentioned were the wants,64
NA,people who kept the security files in the United,64
NA,"States, the people who would have made the officers",64
NA,judgments on the ultimate likelihood,64
NA,ity file being required. Burgess and MCLean were,64
NA,part of a security organisation. This clause,64
NA,responsibility for making subjective,64
NA,the hands of people at that level.,64
NA,The danger of a clause such as this is that,64
NA,subjective judgment is to be,64
NA,who may or may not be competent to make that,64
NA,judgment-tha t also is a subjective judgment-o n about-,64
NA,"the future of a person who may be 16, 17 or 18",64
NA,years of age. That judgment will affect that per-,64
NA,son's prospects of advancement through this,64
NA,ciety. It is a judgment that can ultimately lead,64
NA,their being denied positions for which they are,64
NA,qualified and to which they are entitled,64
NA,basis that a security file on them exists. I think,64
NA,that the Committee should remember that the,64
NA,commencement of a security file on any person is,64
NA,"a significant disadvantage to that person, irresinvolvement",64
NA,pective of whether any subversive or other accurity,64
NA,tivity ever takes place. The persons that the person.,64
NA,honourable member for North Sydney men-,64
NA,tioned are not the type of people who one would,64
NA,be talking about as ultimately taking part in,64
NA,subversive activity. They were know to have,64
NA,taken part and were taking part in a subversive,64
NA,activity.,64
Mr VINER ,I t is the people you have to protect,64
NA,your country against.,64
Mr SCHOLES,I think we have to protect the,64
NA,country and I think we have to protect the,64
NA,country against people who believe that an indi-,64
NA,vidual 's rights should be subject to the political,64
NA,nees or thoughts of a person such as the Minister.,64
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr GILES) -,64
NA,Order! The honourable member for Corio had,64
NA,better watch out that he does not impute im-,64
NA,proper motives against honourable members,64
NA,during this debate.,64
Mr SCHOLES,I thought that interjections,64
NA,"were also out of order, Mr Deputy Chairman. I",64
NA,suggest that you should take the Minister to task.,64
NA,It seems to be a practice of the Chair now to call,64
NA,the speaker to order and not the person who,64
NA,interjects.,64
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Order! The,64
NA,honourable member will withdraw that remark.,64
Mr SCHOLES,1 withdraw the remark. I will,64
NA,make an official complaint. It is happening all,64
NA,the time. The facts are that the Government,64
NA,to be in a position in which it can disad-,64
NA,vantage for life anyone whom it feels or one of its,64
NA,feels may become a political activist or,64
NA,of a securjust an activist.,64
NA,Mr Ruddock-On e of the amendments you,64
NA,places ought to move is one to give the Government,64
NA,judgment in more power.,64
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr Giles),64
NA,a Order! The honourable member for Dundas has,64
NA,made by a person made his speech.,64
Mr SCHOLES,The clause we are talking,64
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Order! If the,64
NA,sohonourable member for Corio wishes to get pro-,64
NA,to tection from the Chair while he is talking he,64
NA,should not try to shout down the occupant of the,64
NA,on the Chair when that person is talking.,64
Mr SCHOLES,I just said that the words of,64
NA,the clause we are discussing- I cannot think of,64
NA,anything more relevant-sa y that if an activity or,64
NA,of a person may ultimately be a se-,64
NA,risk a security file can be opened on that,64
NA,Let us look at the facts about the success of,64
NA,a these security organisations. How many political,64
NA,bombings have taken place in Australia in the,64
NA,last 10 years? About how many of them have we,64
NA,been forewarned by the Australian security or-,64
NA,ganisations? How many people have been disad-,64
NA,vantaged in Australia-denie d Australian citi-,64
NA,"zenship, denied positions in the Public Service",64
NA,and denied normal civilian rights in Australia-,64
NA,because of the existence of a security file?,64
NA,Mr MCLean-Ho w many?,64
Mr SCHOLES, I can name two members of,64
NA,the Victorian Parliament if the honourable,64
NA,member wants me to do so.,64
NA,Mr MCLean-G o on.,64
Mr SCHOLES,"Sgro and Sidiropoulos, who",65
NA,are both currently members ofthe Victorian Par-,65
NA,liament and who were both denied citizenship of,65
NA,this country by a Liberal government because of,65
NA,security reports. I can name a business house in,65
NA,South Australia which was closed as a security,65
NA,risk because it was in the proximity of Salisbury.,65
NA,It was not closed because of any security risk but,65
NA,because the security officers could not get the,65
NA,favours that they demanded from the proprietor.,65
NA,That is the sort of power that will be given by this,65
NA,Bill.,65
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr GILES) - curity,65
NA,Order! The honourable member for Corio is the,65
NA,only speaker so far who has not attempted,65
NA,plain to the Chair or the Committee why the,65
NA,word 'ultimately' should or should not,65
NA,this Bill. 1 now invite him to do so.,65
Mr SCHOLES," Mr Deputy Chairman, the can",65
NA,word 'ultimately' gives almost unUmited power,65
NA,as to whether to start a security file on a person,65
NA,without any specific reason or need for any,65
NA,specific reason where security is involved or seen,65
NA,to be involved. The word 'ultimately' means that,65
NA,"if, in the subjective judgment of an individual",65
NA,"public servant who happens to be in security,",65
NA,that person ultimately sees a threat-i t may be,65
NA,his own position-i n the activities or any activity,65
NA,"which is taking place, a security file may",65
NA,started. It may be started on a young person who,65
NA,is attending a meeting about which he knows,65
NA,nothing and which he is attending to find out,65
NA,what it is all about. Some people have an inquisiing,65
NA,tive nature. That person can find himself with,65
NA,security file for life. He has no opportunity,65
NA,examine thatfileor to have thefileexamined. He,65
NA,has no access to it and no chance to disprove,65
NA,what is contained in it.,65
NA,The danger which we see and which I think,65
NA,any thinking person would see in that sort of,65
NA,practice is that a person's whole life is disadvanall,65
NA,taged because there is no need to justify the,65
NA,opening of a file. That situation may be accept-,65
NA,able in totalitarian countries but it is certainly,65
NA,acceptable in a democracy. Surely persons,65
NA,the right to expect there to be some substantial,65
NA,reason for their entire careers being disadvanwhat,65
NA,taged. Anyone who suggests that the opening of,65
NA,a securityfileon a person does not disadvantage,65
NA,"that person, does not know how our system",65
NA,works.,65
NA,If the security systems around the world had a,65
NA,good record- a record of documents not being,65
NA,leaked and of documents not being found in,65
NA,places where they could disadvantage people,65
NA,who were not friends of certain people-the n it,65
NA,"might be an acceptable practice. However, it is",65
NA,not an acceptable practice judging by the track,65
NA,record of the organisations concerned. Certainly,65
NA,it is not an acceptable practice when there is no,65
NA,means by which the judgment to open that file,65
NA,on an ultimate but not actual fact can be tested,65
NA,by any person. Nor can the information which is,65
NA,contained in that file be examined. If I were to,65
NA,stand in this House and say that the honourable,65
NA,member for Ombligalablo- I do not think there,65
NA,"is such an electorate-wa s seen robbing a bank,",65
NA,someone could challenge that statement. If that,65
NA,information is submitted in a secret way to a se-,65
NA,organisation and if the note which is sub-,65
NA,"mitted goes in the person's file, whilst the infor-",65
NA,to exmation may be evaluated as being of no,65
NA,"consequence, the collection of such items can be",65
NA,remain in of substantial significance.,65
NA,What I am protesting about is that a person,65
NA,have a file into which that information can,65
NA,be placed without there being any justification,65
NA,for the existence of that file. I do not know why,65
NA,the Government finds it necessary to maintain,65
NA,the word 'ultimately' in the clause. It is not un-,65
NA,reasonable to require some justification for the,65
NA,opening of a file before a person's future is,65
NA,threatened. It is not unreasonable for a person,65
NA,to whose entire future could be involved to have,65
NA,some protection. I would have thought that in a,65
NA,be democratic society the Parliament was respon-,65
NA,sible for and required to provide that protection.,65
NA,It appears that this House is involved in a prac-,65
NA,tice of denying protection to citizens and acquir-,65
NA,for instrumentalities of the Government of,65
NA,a the day means by which the rights of individuals,65
NA,to can be denied rather than protected.,65
Mr CARLTON ,Mackellar) (4.18)- Mr,65
NA,"Deputy Chairman, I intend to direct my remarks",65
NA,to the word 'ultimately'. Obviously there is a,65
NA,problem in this debate in that the Opposition is,65
NA,suggesting that by omitting the word 'ultimately',65
NA,the complaints that have been expressed by,65
NA,its members against paragraph (a) of sub-clause,65
NA,(1) of clause 5 will somehow be eliminated. I just,65
NA,not cannot understand that reasoning. For the infor-,65
NA,have mation of anybody coming from Mars or any-,65
NA,body who has just turned on his radio I point out,65
NA,we are actually discussing at the moment is,65
NA,"the definition of the word 'subversion', which is",65
NA,an extremely difficult matter. After stripping out,65
NA,the words that are not immediately relevant in,65
NA,"the clause, clause 5(1) reads:",65
NA,"For the purposes of this Act, the activides of persons",65
NA,. . . that are to be regarded as subversion are-,65
NA,"(a) activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are",65
NA,"intended or likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the",65
NA,use of force or violence or other unlawful,65
NA,acts . . .,65
NA,The remarks of Opposition members are,66
NA,intended to suggest that by leaving out the word,66
NA,'ultimately' all of their objections will somehow,66
NA,disappear. It strikes me that most of their re-,66
NA,marks have been directed towards attacking the,66
NA,idea of defining 'subversion' in any form. If the,66
NA,"word 'ultimately' were crossed out, we would",66
NA,still be left with such phrases as 'or lead to'. It,66
NA,strikes me that that phrase is very much in the,66
NA,same context as the word 'ultimately'. I think,66
NA,that the matter of individual judgment which has,66
NA,to be applied is no less severe when a person,66
NA,looks at the words 'or lead to' than it is when he,66
NA,"looks at the word 'ultimately'. In other words,",66
NA,even if the Government were to accept the,66
NA,amendment put forward by the Opposition I fail,66
NA,to see how that would put its fears to rest.,66
NA,"In fact, the speech of the honourable member",66
NA,for Lalor ( Mr Barry Jones) and the speech of the,66
NA,honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes),66
NA,"were directed, it seemed to me, against any",66
NA,definition of the word 'subversion'. Does the Op-,66
NA,position really want to eliminate any definition of,66
NA,the word 'subversion'? Basically I challenge the,66
NA,honourable member for Lalor in this matter be-,66
NA,cause he seemed to be asking a series of ques-,66
NA,tions. He seemed to be aslting whether there,66
NA,really was any such thing as subversion which,66
NA,could be defined within the Australian com-,66
NA,munity. He asked honourable members on the,66
NA,Government side to give examples of subversion.,66
NA,"My friend, the honourable and gallant member",66
NA,for North Sydney ( Mr Graham) gave an excel-,66
NA,lent example of what was meant.,66
NA,Mr Barry Jones-Contemporar y examples.,66
Mr CARLTON, I think one could quite easily,66
NA,consider contemporary examples of the same,66
NA,kind. Unless the Opposition can come up with,66
NA,substantial arguments related specifically to the,66
NA,one word which it asks us to withdraw and unless,66
NA,it can explain how the withdrawal of that one,66
NA,word will remove all of its objections to that part,66
NA,"of the clause, I am afraid I will have to support",66
NA,the retention of that word. I believe that the,66
NA,definition of 'subversion' is an extraordinarily,66
NA,difficult thing. I do not think any of us on either,66
NA,side of the House are particularly happy about,66
NA,the necessity to have a security intelligence or-,66
NA,ganisation. None of us is particularly happy,66
NA,about having to get down to the rather dreadful,66
NA,business of defining the word 'subversion'. I feel,66
NA,very sorry indeed for the draftsmen who have to,66
NA,come up with a definition which will somehow,66
NA,deal with all kinds of possible actions which,66
NA,could lead to the destruction of our society and,66
NA,which does not in any way infringe individual,66
NA,liberties.,66
NA,To me it is an almost impossible task. Cer-,66
NA,tainly members of the Opposition acknowledged,66
NA,that point when they said that there was an el-,66
NA,ement of individual judgment in this matter. I,66
NA,cannot see how it would make any difference to,66
NA,"the ASIO operator, at whatever level, in his",66
NA,selection of a matter for a file if the word 'ulti-,66
NA,mately' were left out. I am not a draftsman; I am,66
NA,not a legal person. I find it difficult to see the,66
NA,need for all the words in the paragraph con-,66
NA,cerned. The one thing that I am absolutely cer-,66
NA,tain of is that the removal of this one word would,66
NA,not remove the objections of the Opposition to,66
NA,that part of the clause.,66
Mr HOLDING ,Melbourne Ports) (4.23)- I,66
NA,want to take up the point which the honourable,66
NA,member for Mackellar ( Mr Carlton) was making,66
NA,by referring to an existing situation in Australia.,66
NA,The thrust of our arguments goes to the deletion,66
NA,of these two words 'likely ultimately'.,66
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , Mr GILES) -,66
NA,Order! The Chair understands that only one,66
NA,word is mentioned in the amendment.,66
Mr HOLDING,"Tha t is right, but that is the",66
NA,context. Let me postulate a set of facts. The prob-,66
NA,lem is: What sort of political problem do we drop,66
NA,on the plate of the Director-General? I wish to,66
NA,refer to a situation which is occurring constantly,66
NA,"in Queenland, namely, the question of street",66
NA,marches. If a citizen participates in a street,66
NA,march in Queensland-stree t marches are,66
NA,against the law-doe s that constitute a set of cir-,66
NA,cumstances which ought to be brought to the,66
NA,attention of the Director-General for the purpose,66
NA,of keeping such a person under scrutiny and,66
NA,under surveillance for the purposes of this Act?,66
NA,"That is, does the act of marching by a person",66
NA,who feels strongly against that law render the,66
NA,citizen who exercises that right subject to the,66
NA,definition of'subversion'?,66
Mr GRAHAM ,Wha t about if he flies from Syd-,66
NA,ney to Brisbane just to march?,66
NA,"Mr Ruddock-Eve n if the definition covers it,",66
NA,ultimately it does not alter it.,66
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN , O r d e r!,66
NA,Honourable members have made their speeches.,66
Mr HOLDING,"M y own view would be, and",66
NA,I believe many members of the Liberal Party,66
NA,"would support my view, that the action of any",66
NA,citizen in marching in order to protest against a,66
NA,law that prohibits marching is not the sort of act,66
NA,which ought to attract the operation of this sec-,66
NA,"tion, and it should not attract the attention of the",66
NA,Director-General.,66
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-O f course it depends a little,67
NA,"on when you march, you know.",67
Mr HOLDING,"Well, here it comes.",67
NA,"Mr Kevin Cairns-No , it depends a little on",67
NA,when you march.,67
Mr HOLDING, I am grateful for the interjec-,67
NA,tion because-,67
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,Order! The,67
NA,Chair is not grateful for the interjection. The,67
NA,Chair still wants to know how you think the situ-,67
NA,ation would be overcome by omitting the word,67
NA,'ultimately'. To my mind you still have not estab-,67
NA,lished this.,67
Mr HOLDING,That is what I now propose,67
NA,to deal with. If one were to have a Director-,67
NA,General who was a man of small '1' liberal,67
NA,"approaches, and he looked at this section on",67
NA,what falls within the definition of subversion-,67
NA,and subversion is what we are talking about-,67
NA,because the act has to involve or lead to an un-,67
NA,lawful act-h e could rule that the act of marching,67
NA,"was an unlawful act. On any interpretation, I",67
NA,think it is true to say that the act of marching,67
NA,lead to an unlawful act because it will involve a,67
NA,"breach of a law which, whether people like it or",67
NA,"not, is unlawful.",67
Mr VINER ,I t involves marching.,67
Mr HOLDING,That is right. We have now,67
NA,got to that stage. The question now is whether,67
NA,that act was carried out for the purpose of des-,67
NA,troying the constitutional government of the,67
NA,Commonwealth or of a State. I take the view-,67
NA,and I believe many small '1' liberals would agree,67
NA,with me- that the act of marching by a citizen,67
NA,who wants to protest against a State government,67
NA,which says that he cannot march without a per-,67
NA,"mit, is not the kind of political or social action",67
NA,which ought to attract the operation or the atten-,67
NA,tion of security forces in order to prescribe that,67
NA,citizen as being involved in a possible act of sub-,67
NA,version. When that problem arises and is on the,67
NA,desk of the Director-General I think that if he,67
NA,"were to take the view that I have just expressed,",67
NA,he could argue that way. But can any Director-,67
NA,"General, no matter how small ' F a liberal he",67
NA,"might be, or could the honourable member for",67
NA,"Dundas ( Mr Ruddock) for that matter, take the",67
NA,view that the act of marching cannot constitute a,67
NA,situation which is likely ultimately-an d that is,67
NA,the problem-i s likely ultimately to overthrow,67
NA,the State?,67
NA,Mr Kerin-Bjelk e takes that view.,67
Mr HOLDING,Ther e can be no doubt that say:,67
NA,the Premier of Queensland has made it perfectly,67
NA,clear that he regards the act of marching,67
NA,ultimately directed to overthrowing the State.,67
NA,The honourable member for Lilley ( Mr Kevin,67
NA,"Cairns) says that he believes that way too,",67
NA,"although it depends, he seems to think, what",67
NA,time of day or night the march takes place. The,67
NA,point I make is that the use of the term 'ultima-,67
NA,tely' involves a series of judgments. It is a very,67
NA,"different thing for anybody to say: 'Well, per-",67
NA,haps a march today and tomorrow might not,67
NA,ultimately involve the overthrow of the state'.,67
NA,Mr Barry Jones-O r violence by others.,67
Mr HOLDING,That is right. That is the di-,67
NA,"lemma, and I do not believe that the Director-",67
NA,General ought to be placed in that dilemma. I f i,67
NA,have to choose as to the role and the responsibili-,67
NA,"ties of our security organisations, I do not believe",67
NA,they ought to be wasting time collecting dossiers,67
NA,on people who are marching up streets in Bris-,67
NA,bane and being grabbed by sturdy policemen. I,67
NA,take the point made by the honourable member,67
NA,"for North Sydney ( Mr Graham) about Burgess,",67
NA,MCLean and Philby. The point about all of those,67
NA,will gentlemen is that they were not the type of,67
NA,people-the y were too well bred; they were so,67
NA,much part of the establishment to attract the,67
NA,attention of the security organisation-,67
NA,Mr Barry Jones-Bu t they were part of the se-,67
NA,curity organisation.,67
Mr HOLDING, I appreciate that; I am going,67
NA,to come to that. Not only were they part of the,67
NA,"security organisation, but the security organis-",67
NA,"ation, instead of worrying about Burgess,",67
NA,"MCLean and Philby, was probably trailing some",67
NA,trade union secretary to a meeting. That is the di-,67
NA,lemma. The dilemma of this clause is that it im-,67
NA,poses a responsibility on the Director-General,67
NA,which means that he does have seriously to con-,67
NA,sider whether he is going to waste the time and,67
NA,funds of his organisation by placing officers of se-,67
NA,curity in buildings in Brisbane to take photo-,67
NA,graphs of people who are exercising their demo-,67
NA,cratic rights. That is what it comes down to. I do,67
NA,not believe that that is a situation that ought to,67
NA,be on the plate of the Director-General. I think,67
NA,that far more serious and far more important,67
NA,things ought to be occupying his attention.,67
NA,"Whether one likes street marches or not, that ar-",67
NA,gument is really part of the ongoing democratic,67
NA,argument in our community and in my view,67
NA,ought to be excluded from security surveillance.,67
NA,So long as this clause is worded in this way I do,67
NA,not believe any Director-General could safely,67
NA,"'Well, I take the view that those actions by",67
NA,those citizens cannot be likely ultimately to lead,67
NA,per se as to an overthrow of the state'.,67
NA,This is political conjecture that he is involved,68
NA,in where I think he would be bound to act some-,68
NA,what strictly in accordance with the terms ofthe,68
NA,legislation. That is what worries honourable,68
NA,members on this side of the chamber. I do not,68
NA,believe that those sorts of actions ought to be,68
NA,able to be placed within the context of subver-,68
NA,sion because I do not believe that they are sub-,68
NA,"version, and I do not beUeve that the Director-",68
NA,General ought to have to consider whether those,68
NA,"actions constitute subversion, and they should",68
NA,not be taking up thetimeand the funds of our se-,68
NA,curity organisation. That is the point I make. To,68
NA,leave the clause in this way creates that problem,68
NA,for the Director-General. I come back to the,68
NA,"point that I made previously, that a narrow",68
NA,definition-an d it will be slightly narrower if the,68
NA,"amendment is carried-wil l not, in my view,",68
NA,seriously hamper for one moment the operations,68
NA,of our security organisation. I do not believe that,68
NA,we should be involving the Director-General of,68
NA,Security in situations where we give him a defini-,68
NA,"tion that is so broad, so wide that hefinishesup",68
NA,having to involve himself and having to involve,68
NA,his service in what has been described as spook,68
NA,activities which are directed towards the legit-,68
NA,"imate rights, the Ugitimate expression of view",68
NA,and the legitimate exercise of the civil liberties of,68
NA,the Australian people.,68
Mr GRAHAM ,North Sydney) (4.33)-Very,68
NA,quickly and very briefly I would like to say this: I,68
NA,came to this place in 1949-50 into the Nineteenth,68
NA,Parliament. This is now the Thirty-first Parlia-,68
NA,"ment. I f i learnt anything in those years, listening",68
NA,"to the elders who were in this place, I learnt",68
NA,something that perhaps in my own mind made,68
NA,me a Uttle more mature and a bit more aware,68
NA,than I was in previous years. Every comment that,68
NA,the distinguished and honourable member for,68
NA,"Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holding) has made, with",68
NA,all the years of experience he has had in the Par-,68
NA,"liament of Victoria, seem to indicate that he has",68
NA,learnt absolutely nothing from history. Is it a fact,68
NA,that the honourable member for Lalor ( Mr Barry,68
NA,"Jones), a distinguished historian, has learnt ab-",68
NA,solutely nothing? Does he not understand that,68
NA,the people who started during the Weimar Re-,68
NA,"public in the previous decades, were seen march-",68
NA,ing in the streets? Has he never heard of Captain,68
NA,Ernst Roehm? Has he never heard of the SA-th e,68
NA,Sturmabteilung? Has he heard nothing at all of,68
NA,the brownshirts? Has he heard nothing at all of,68
NA,what was called the National Socialist German,68
NA,Workers Party? Why was it given a name of that,68
NA,"description if it were not, as a national socialist",68
NA,"German workers party, to make in the ultimate",68
NA,sense an appeal to those people less sophisticated,68
NA,than the great majority of electors in that,68
NA,country? The fact of the matter is this: The story,68
NA,can be seen throughout the whole history of,68
NA,Europe. I ask the honourable member for Lalor,68
NA,to stand in this place and tell us of Prince,68
NA,"Ruediger von Starhemberg in Vienna, to tell us",68
NA,"about Dollfuss and the way he was murdered, to",68
NA,tell us about the ultimate event that took place in,68
NA,"Prague, to tell us about Dr Edward Benes, Jan",68
NA,"Masaryk, and all of those people who were part",68
NA,and parcel of the picture of 50 years of,68
NA,subversion.,68
NA,The word 'ultimately' has a long term conno-,68
NA,tation and deals with judgment. If there were,68
NA,people who could have made a judgment in,68
NA,"1930, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1937, does the",68
NA,honourable gentleman understand that millions,68
NA,of people who are now dead might be alive,68
NA,today? Does he understand that there might,68
NA,"have been some negotiations, some co-ordinated",68
NA,"cohesion of human beings, that would have per-",68
NA,haps avoided the horrific World War II? Do,68
NA,these events mean nothing to the intellectual,68
NA,giant who comes amongst us and tells us that we,68
NA,should argue only in the contemporary context?,68
NA,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I have heard some non-",68
NA,"sense in my life, but by the heavens I have heard",68
NA,no such nonsense as that which I have heard in,68
NA,recent times.,68
NA,Had the former leader of the Labor Party in,68
NA,the Victorian Parliament become the Premier of,68
NA,"that State, in my judgment based on some of the",68
NA,"speeches that he has made in the past, he would",68
NA,have made it clear to the honourable member,68
NA,that he would not have tolerated masses of,68
NA,"people, activated by emotions, reasons and",68
NA,"influences of which he would not have approved,",68
NA,charging up and down Collins Street and cre-,68
NA,ating great misery for the people in the great city,68
NA,of Melbourne. When people go from Victoria,68
NA,and New South Wales to Queensland and pay,68
NA,"money to fly interstate, at levels of which the",68
NA,Labor Party is always complaining-an d go,68
NA,"there, I might add, at the taxpayers' expense-t o",68
NA,appear as though they are in some Gilbert and,68
NA,"Sullivan fantasy, to march up and down the",68
NA,streets of Queensland to irritate a Scandinavian,68
NA,"who is now the Premier of that State, it seems to",68
NA,me to be nothing less than bizarre.,68
NA,I repeat that if we want to know what,68
NA,members of the Labor Party truly think and,68
NA,"what are their emotions about subversion, we",68
NA,have to go back beyond the rump that sits in this,68
NA,Parliament. In my mind there is a clear under-,68
NA,standing that the Ministry in 1948 and 1949,68
NA,knew what subversion was. Do honourable,68
NA,members opposite know what their greatest,68
NA,Prime Minister did? He put the soldiers into the,69
NA,coal mines. Honourable members opposite,69
NA,would have stood like a pack of people immune,69
NA,from a concentrated judgment. They would have,69
NA,"stood, as in the present context, to moan, groan",69
NA,and complain about direction from the Prime,69
NA,Minister. That is the sort of thing that members,69
NA,of the Labor Party do when they are in govern-,69
NA,ment. But when they are in opposition- I must,69
NA,admit that this is what most oppositions do-the y,69
NA,cry with the savoir-faire and charm that are nor-,69
NA,mally detectable in Montmartre and San,69
NA,Antoine.,69
Dr BLEWETT ,Bonython) (4.37)-I cannot,69
NA,see what the last five minutes rhetoric has to,69
NA,with the word 'ultimately'. I just ask to have,69
NA,the time used by the honourable member for about,69
NA,North Sydney ( Mr Graham) simply to correct every,69
NA,"the prime historical fallacy, because it relates",69
NA,fundamentally to this debate. As I suggested the,69
NA,"other day, the important point is that, both in the",69
NA,case of Weimar Germany and in the case of ofthe Bill.,69
NA,"democratic Austria in the 1930s, the government",69
NA,was betrayed by its secret police. In both of,69
NA,cases forces within the secret agencies owed their,69
NA,loyalty either to an old regime or to bodies,69
NA,side the democratic government. The whole of,69
NA,our purpose in this debate is not to destroy,69
NA,authority of democratic governments but to,69
NA,vent those sorts of things from happening-t,69
NA,make sure that the secret agencies which we,69
NA,necessarily have to employ but which we regret,69
NA,"employing are, in fact, responsible to the demoTherefore,",69
NA,cratic government.,69
Mr VINER ,Stirling-Minister for Employ-,69
NA,ment and Youth Affairs) (4.39)-Thi,69
NA,has gone on for quite some time and has been a,69
NA,matter of great interest; but that is not unexsecurity,69
NA,pected as this is the very first amendment to be leads,69
NA,debated. There has swirled around this one word place,69
NA,argument against the very substance of the legis-,69
NA,lation and the very existence of the Australian between,69
NA,Security Intelligence Organisation. As dme goes vation,69
NA,on in this debate it will be most revealing to see easy,69
NA,where those speakers who spoke against the,69
NA,clusion of the word 'ultimately' ultimately stand,69
NA,with respect to the very existence of ASIO.,69
NA,"Therefore, let me take a moment to refer to",69
NA,of the things said by Mr Justice Hope,69
NA,port. I do so because people listening to this de-,69
NA,"bate might think that neither this Government, monwealth.",69
NA,"Mr Justice Hope, nor ASIO itself, has any regard it",69
NA,for the individual rights and freedoms,69
NA,"tralian citizens. This Government knows, as",69
NA,Mr Chifley and the Menzies Government before,69
NA,"us, that in this area there is a delicate balance",69
NA,tween those individual rights and freedoms,69
NA,the security of our nation. We know also that at,69
NA,times it presents dilemmas to us-,69
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ," Mr Chairman, I take a",69
NA,point of order. The Minister is virtually making a,69
NA,second reading speech in reply to what he thinks,69
NA,the Opposition's view is on ASIO. It is quite clear,69
NA,that we support ASIO. We are arguing the defini-,69
NA,tion of'subversion' in the context of whether the,69
NA,word 'ultimately' should be in that definition. It,69
NA,has nothing to do with a wide-embracing debate,69
NA,that we would love to have at any time on the,69
NA,merits of intelligence forces. We support an intel-,69
NA,"ligence force, but we do not support the defini-",69
NA,tion which apparently has been drawn by some,69
NA,"do parliamentary counsel who, I submit, is not even",69
NA,half a member of the Government. We are talking,69
NA,"words. If this sort of speech is to be made,",69
NA,one of us will get up again in order to reply,69
NA,to the sort of innuendo that has been created. Let,69
NA,me make it very clear that we want to talk about,69
NA,"only the drafting of the clause, not the principle",69
The CHAIRMAN,Th e question before the,69
NA,those Committee at the moment of necessity has,69
NA,invited debate which has possibly sorely taxed,69
NA,"outthe matter of relevance; but, on the assumption",69
NA,that the debate has met with the approbation of,69
NA,the the Committee and has not contravened Stand-,69
NA,"preing Orders, the Chair has been inclined to be",69
NA,o tolerant. During the course of the debate the,69
NA,matters to which the Minister presently refers,69
NA,have been advanced and accepted as relevant.,69
NA,I am prepared to hear the Minister,69
NA,further.,69
Mr VINER,"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Mr",69
NA,s debate Justice Hope said:,69
NA,I have started by considering whether Australia needs a,69
NA,service such as ASIO was created to provide. That,69
NA,"to a consideration of what is, or should be, the proper",69
NA,of a domestic security service in a liberal democracy,69
NA,like Australia.,69
NA,I have had in mind throughout my inquiries that a balance,69
NA,the rights of individual persons and the preser-,69
NA,of the security of Australia as a nation is no simple or,69
NA,"thing to achieve. But, 'in the final analysis, public safety",69
NA,inand individual liberty sustain each other'.,69
NA,"I refer to another statement of Mr Justice Hope,",69
NA,particularly to answer a statement made by the,69
NA,some honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Donald,69
NA,in his reCameron) Mr Justice Hope said:,69
NA,ASIO is an organ of the executive government of the Com-,69
NA,"Although many of its operations must be secret,",69
NA,"is nevertheless answerable to Ministers, and through them",69
NA,of Austo the Parliament and the people.,69
NA,did I quote that because the honourable gentleman,69
NA,quite fallaciously said that ASIO is not answer-,69
NA,beable to the Government or the people. This legis-,69
NA,and lation shows how ASIO is answerable to the,69
NA,"Attorney-General and, through the Attorney-",70
NA,"General, of course, to the Parliament and the",70
NA,"people. Furthermore, as ASIO is an organ of the",70
NA,"executive government of the Commonwealth,",70
NA,this Government must be answerable for the,70
NA,activities of ASIO to this Parliament and to the,70
NA,people. Much of the criticism of the use of the,70
NA,word 'ultimately' turned on the fact that the Aus-,70
NA,tralian Security Intelligence Organisation might,70
NA,mismanage or misuse the authority that is given,70
NA,to it. We know that no man or woman in this,70
NA,world is perfect and therefore it is understanda-,70
NA,ble that Mr Justice Hope said that:,70
NA,As an organisation ASIO needs management. Over,70
NA,number of years ASIO's management was not as good,70
NA,should have been. If Australia needs a secunty service-an,70
NA,shall show that it does-i t must be well run. Those,70
NA,it must have high personal qualities.,70
NA,When speaking of the fact that he found,70
NA,disorder in ASIO's files he said this:,70
NA,I have taken the view . . .,70
NA,recommendations for the future,70
NA,down the truth or otherwise of past errors or alleged past,70
NA,errors.,70
NA,I think those words might well be quoted to some,70
NA,ofthe honourable members who have spoken in,70
NA,this debate. Nor is it an answer to the use of the,70
NA,word 'ultimately' in this definition to refer to the,70
NA,White report upon the activities of the Special,70
NA,Branch of the South Australian State police. We,70
NA,are not debating the State Special Branch of,70
NA,South Australia; we are debating a Bill to give,70
NA,special authority to the Australian Security Intel-,70
NA,ligence Organisation. I make it quite clear that,70
NA,the State Special Branch is not ASIO. So let us,70
NA,debate upon the basis of the Hope report and not,70
NA,of the White report. The Government has not,70
NA,simply plucked this word 'ultimately' out of the,70
NA,"air. As I said earlier, it was, in fact, a recommen-",70
NA,dation of Mr Justice Hope that the word be used,70
NA,in the juxtaposition of the three fundamental el-,70
NA,ements of the meaning of subversion as provided,70
NA,for in clause 5 (1) (a). It refers to:,70
NA,"activities that involve, will involve or lead to, or are intended Cameron, Donald",70
NA,"or likely ultimately to involve or lead to,",70
NA,That is one element. The second element is:,70
NA,the use of force or violence or other unlawful acts-,70
NA,"The third element-o f course, this is a fundamen-",70
NA,tal and vital element-i n the clause is:,70
NA,for the purpose of overthrowing or destroying the consti-,70
NA,tutional government of the Commonwealth or of a State or,70
NA,Territoiy;,70
NA,I think that when one understands those three,70
NA,fundamental elements one can quickly draw the,70
NA,conclusion that the kind of example that the,70
NA,honourable member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr,70
NA,Holding) was referring to would not come within,70
NA,the meaning of 'subversion'. He used the,70
NA,example of street marches in Queensland. Of,70
NA,"course, what is lacking from his example is the",70
NA,third element. There is a clear distinction be-,70
NA,tween activity intended to or likely to change the,70
NA,law or change a government at the ballot box on,70
NA,the one hand and activity which has as its pur-,70
NA,pose the overthrow or destruction of a consti-,70
NA,tutional government as we know it in Australia. I,70
NA,think that distinction must be very clearly borne,70
NA,in mind. It will be borne in mind if one appreci-,70
NA,ates the three fundamental elements in the,70
NA,"meaning of 'subversion', and that is why the",70
NA,word 'ultimately' is critical to the authority of,70
NA,a ASIO to act in the interests of national security.,70
NA,as it Having said that and having listened to all the,70
NA,d I contributions in this debate from both sides of,70
NA,working in the House for which I thank honourable,70
NA,"members, I think that the House will see why the",70
NA,some Government cannot accept the amendment,70
NA,proposed to remove that word 'ultimately' from,70
NA,that my task is to make the clause.,70
NA,rather than to seek to track,70
NA,Question put:,70

NA,Bowen's amendment) stand part ofthe clause.,70

NA,(4.58)- I move:,71
NA,"Clause 5, page 3, line 9, before ""activities"" insert",71
NA,"""unlawful"".",71
NA,In debating the Australian Security Intelligence,71
NA,Organization Bill we are dealing-grapplin g,71
NA,might be the more appropriate word-wit h a,71
NA,legal definition of the word 'subversion'. In an nation.,71
NA,"attempt to define the meaning of subversion,",71
NA,clause 5 reads:,71
NA,"(b) activities directed to obstructing, hindering",71
NA,fering with the performance by the Defence Force of its,71
NA,functions or the carrying out of other activities by,71
NA,Com monwealth for the purposes,71
NA,the Commonwealth;,71
NA,Nobody would have any objection to the prinpeople,71
NA,ciple that there should be no hindrance to the,71
NA,performance of the Defence Force in looking,71
NA,after the security of the nation. The key point,71
NA,the sub-clause is that subversion is deemed to,71
NA,exist when the activities are,71
NA,"purpose. From a drafting point of view, what",71
NA,activities are considered to be subversive? The,71
NA,point I am trying to make is that,71
NA,objection at all to the whole weight of the clause,71
NA,being applicable to activities that are directed,71
NA,"obstructing, hindering or interfering with the",71
NA,performance by the Defence Force of its func-,71
NA,tions. It is a question of what sort of activities are,71
NA,deemed to do so. The Opposition is,71
NA,define the activities because they are related to,71
NA,subversion. When activities have an element of,71
NA,subversion in them afileis made on those people,71
NA,who are involved in the activities. In our view it,71
NA,appropriate to define the activides as being,71
NA,lawful activities which will hinder the Defence,71
NA,Force and prevent it from looking after the sedeemed,71
NA,curity or the defence of the nation.,71
NA,It will be noted that the whole purpose of the,71
NA,clause centres on the effects of activities but the,71
NA,clause does not categorise the activities. Again it,71
NA,leaves that to a subjective judgment. We of the,71
NA,Opposition say that the activities ought to be,71
NA,defined as unlawful. Let me cite an example of,71
NA,what we would deem to be a bona fide activity. A,71
NA,union dispute on the waterfront about a vessel,71
NA,being a health hazard because it had not been,71
NA,fumigated could be interpreted by somebody to,71
NA,"be in some way, remote as the dispute may be",71
NA,"from subversive activity, to be hindering the per-",71
NA,formance of the Defence Force because the ves-,71
NA,sel is being used for carrying supplies somewhere,71
NA,up north. It can be seen that there has to be an in-,71
NA,"telligent appraisal, and I use the word 'intelli-",71
NA,"gent' in terms of skill, as to what we are about.",71
NA,The words 'hindering or interfering' are well,71
NA,known in industrial law. They simply cannot be,71
NA,translated from the industrial context to a defini-,71
NA,of subversion. In intelligence operations skill,71
NA,is required to determine the real intent of the ac-,71
NA,"tivity. It seems that, in determining whether an",71
NA,activity is interfering with the performance of the,71
NA,"Defence Force or of its function, the activity must",71
NA,be identified on an intelligent basis as being an,71
NA,activity that is related to the overthrow of the,71
NA,nation or interfering with the security of the,71
NA,Another example of a bona fide activity in,71
NA,or inter- which people may be engaged from the point of,71
NA,view of their conscience involves those people,71
NA,or for the saying that others should not join the armed,71
NA,of security or the defence of,71
NA,forces. That could be their point of view. We,71
NA,have what is called conscientious objection. If,71
NA,were to engage in that sort of activity,71
NA,would it be deemed to be hindering the function,71
NA,of the Defence Force? Some people could sug-,71
NA,"in gest that it would be. In our view, those people",71
NA,again could be deemed to be guilty of the act of,71
NA,directed towards that subversion.,71
NA,Mr Ruddock-I t is not guilty of an act. It is,71
NA,there is no warranting surveillance.,71
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I am trying to make,71
NA,to that point. When does a person become liable to,71
NA,surveillance. I want to make it very clear that-,71
NA,Mr Ruddock-Mak e it clear that that is what it,71
NA,attempting to is-no t guilty of an act.,71
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Guilty of an unlawful,71
NA,act; that is the point. I invite the honourable,71
NA,member in due course to talk about the point I,71
NA,is have just made. If someone says: ' I don't think,71
NA,unpeople should be joining the armed forces' and,71
NA,"he is making speeches to that effect, that could be",71
NA,to be an activity that could hinder the re-,71
NA,"cruitment of people to the forces, but it is not an",71
NA,unlawful activity. There is a distinction. It is as,72
NA,clear as can be. Let me come to the point of what,72
NA,the Opposition is about in regard to this difficult,72
NA,matter of the definition of subversion. We need,72
NA,to give guidance to the people who will operate,72
NA,"under this legislation. Mr Chairman, you know",72
NA,that the legislation was not drafted by Govern-,72
NA,ment members. It had to be drafted by a parlia-,72
NA,mentary counsel. I submit that if three different,72
NA,counsel were to draft this clause there would be,72
NA,three different versions. The whole purpose of,72
NA,this debate is to try to indicate the difficulties in,72
NA,the wording of the clause. Let me quote what Mr,72
NA,Justice Hope had to say on the question of intelli-,72
NA,gence skills. He said:,72
NA,Thus intelligence assessment is no simple or routine,72
NA,tivity but a highly skilled and subtle task. I must report,72
NA,saw little evidence in ASIO that,72
NA,"pertise needed were recognised, or available in any",72
NA,measure.,72
NA,I do not think that the whole course of ASIO has,72
NA,been changed since Mr Justice Hope made those,72
NA,remarks. We have to give it some guidance. In,72
NA,"other words, we have to impart what",72
NA,democracies are all about and what opposition,72
NA,parties mean when they talk about a bipartisan,72
NA,attitude to security. We do not want files to be,72
NA,kept on people simply because their activities can,72
NA,"be interpreted in accordance with this clause,",72
NA,"through the lack of skill in drafting it, as necessi-",72
NA,tating some action. Because somebody makes a,72
NA,speech urging people not to join the armed forces,72
NA,he should not be deemed to be guilty of subver-,72
NA,sion. The Hope report clearly shows that intelli-,72
NA,gence gathering in the past has been a failure. As,72
NA,members of parliament we all know that a lot of,72
NA,information about people has been wrongly col-,72
NA,lected and used against them. Mr Justice Hope,72
NA,said so. Adverse reports have affected people's,72
NA,livelihoods.,72
Mr GRAHAM ,Yo u do not believe that. You did,72
NA,not accept that as a senior Minister in your,72
NA,Government. Do you really mean that?,72
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I really mean it. The,72
NA,honourable gentleman made a delightful contri-,72
NA,bution to the debate this afternoon. Far be it,72
NA,from me to downgrade him for his skill in this re-,72
NA,gard. He should look at what Mr Justice Hope,72
NA,said about adverse reports. The honourable,72
NA,member is always a gentleman and is prepared,72
NA,to listen to an argument. I invite him to look at,72
NA,page 63 of the second report of the Royal Com-,72
NA,mission. It states:,72
NA,Among the records I have seen are cases where an adverse,72
NA,"assessment has been acted upon, and where a mistake of fact",72
NA,or of judgement may have been made. If such a mistake is,72
NA,"made, a grave and permanent injustice may be done lo the",72
NA,"person the subject of the assessment, whether or not the",72
NA,assessment is followed by the employer authority.,72
Mr GRAHAM ,H e says that it may have been,72
NA,made.,72
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,72
NA,member for North Sydney will have an oppor-,72
NA,tunity to speak if he so desires.,72
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,It has happened.,72
NA,The evidence is there. The point I am making in,72
NA,relation to the drafting of this difficult definition,72
NA,"of subversion is that all activities, in some cases,",72
NA,might be interpreted as hindering the defence,72
NA,forces. But such activities have to be unlawful,72
NA,activities in that they directly relate to preventing,72
NA,acthe forces from looking after the security of the,72
NA,that I nation. Otherwise we fall into the difficulty of the,72
NA,the qualities of mind and ex-,72
NA,large intelligence authorities interpreting the words in,72
NA,this clause in their own way.,72
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,72
NA,member's time has expired.,72
Mr RUDDOCK ,Dundas) (5.8)-CIause,72
NA,"5 (b) deals with activities directed to obstructing,",72
NA,hindering or interfering with the performance by,72
NA,the defence forces of their functions or the carry-,72
NA,ing out of other activities related to the security,72
NA,and defence of the Commonwealth. The Oppo-,72
NA,sition is proposing that this clause be qualified by,72
NA,stating that the activities which obstruct or,72
NA,hinder our defence forces must be regarded as,72
NA,unlawful before the Australian Security Intelli-,72
NA,gence Organisation would be in a position to take,72
NA,"some notice of them and to obtain, correlate or",72
NA,evaluate intelligence about them. This is a re-,72
NA,markable proposition. It would have been easier,72
NA,simply to remove the clause altogether than to,72
NA,characterise it as requiring some unlawful conno-,72
NA,tation before ASIO could become involved. If it,72
NA,"is unlawful for people to do what they are doing,",72
NA,let the police deal with them. Perhaps it would be,72
NA,appropriate for some civil authority to move in,72
NA,and punish those who had carried out an unlaw-,72
NA,ful activity. Why does the Opposition want to,72
NA,qualify the clause in this way? What is it attempt-,72
NA,ing to achieve? It became quite clear that while,72
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel,72
NA,Bowen) may have had other examples in,72
NA,mind-h e referred to conscientious objection-,72
NA,his intention was to protect the trade union,72
NA,movement and its right to act in any area in in-,72
NA,dustrial disputes in any way it saw fit. What he is,72
NA,saying in effect is that even though such activity,72
NA,"may obstruct, hinder or interfer with the per-",72
NA,"formance of our defence forces it is, in his view",72
NA,"and in the view of his Party, defensible. I find",72
NA,that suggestion quite objectionable.,72
Dr EVERINGHAM ,Tha t would be unlawful,73
NA,anyway.,73
Mr RUDDOCK,It would not be unlawful carry,73
NA,unless a union was indulging in certain activities,73
NA,"which were, by their character, unlawful. I f it",73
NA,were maliciously damaging property or someto,73
NA,thing of that nature such activity would be,73
NA,lawful. The defence forces may be genuinely inforces,73
NA,volved in the defence of the country. I am not,73
NA,referring to Vietnam which was necessarily re-,73
NA,lated to a quasi political issue. Some people,73
NA,the trade union movement might picket or refuse,73
NA,their labour in order to undermine the effort,73
NA,our defence forces. The Opposition is saying,73
NA,our security force would not be able to carry,73
NA,"its function of obtaining, correlating and evaluatwho",73
NA,ing intelligence in order to protect our defence,73
NA,forces. I regard that approach with a degree,73
NA,abhorrence. Nobody wants to persecute was,73
NA,unreasonably the trade union movement for its,73
NA,pursuit of its industrial causes. Other legislation,73
NA,deals with those matters in any event. But if,73
NA,"activities are directed to obstructing, hindering",73
NA,or interfering with the performance of our,73
NA,"fence forces, surely we want information about",73
NA,them?,73
NA,The Australian Security Intelligence Organiswe,73
NA,ation is not designed to stop people from doing,73
NA,what they want to do. It is designed,73
NA,telligence information to enable us to be,73
NA,informed about their activities. The Deputy,73
NA,Leader of the Opposition spoke of a guilty act.,73
NA,He directed his attention to these words and,73
NA,gested that the activities would make somebody,73
NA,guilty of an act. That implies that some,73
NA,quence in relation to a person's or a union's,73
NA,activities will arise from this legislation.,73
NA,consequences flow from a person's directly,73
NA,"obstructing, hindering or interfering with",73
NA,performance of the defence forces except the,73
NA,consequence of allowing the Australian Security,73
NA,Intelligence Organisation to collect and evaluate,73
NA,information about people who are carrying out,73
NA,those activities. How can the Opposition find that,73
NA,consequence objectionable in the context of our,73
NA,defence forces whose function it is to protect,73
NA,security ofthe country? Let us not get hidebound,73
NA,in words designed to limit the function of the,73
NA,Ogranisation to collect information. Let us not,73
NA,circumscribe it in words such as 'unlawful'. That,73
NA,would mean that we would have to show that,73
NA,some other Act of Parliament,73
NA,"before an activity could be reviewed and, in the",73
NA,words of the Act 'correlated and evaluated' as,73
NA,intelligence information.,73
NA,This clause is a proper clause as it is drawn. It,73
NA,is a responsible function of the Security Organis-,73
NA,ation to protect our defence forces and collect in-,73
NA,formation to ensure that it is free and able to,73
NA,out its proper role of defending and pro-,73
NA,tecting this country. I strongly urge the Com-,73
NA,mittee to reject this amendment and certainly not,73
NA,curcumscribe this clause in such a way that,73
NA,unwould prevent ASIO from protecting our defence,73
NA,in the role they have to carry out for us all.,73
Mr BRYANT ,Wills) (5.15)-The honourable,73
NA,in member for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock) really,73
NA,wrings my heart. Let us imagine some of the situ-,73
NA,of ations in which these adverse reports may be de-,73
NA,that veloped about members of the Public Service;,73
NA,"out for example, people employed in the railways,",73
NA,strike at atimewhen they should be carry-,73
NA,ing a load of miUtary material somewhere. It is,73
NA,"of not unusual, it has happened. In 1944, when I",73
NA,"returning from defending the north, in Dar-",73
NA,"win, we could not take the train because there",73
NA,was a strike on. It was not against the defence,73
NA,its effort or anything else but against the working,73
NA,conditions at the time. We had to come back,73
NA,defrom Darwin some other way. In the atmosphere,73
NA,of the times the honourable member for Dundas,73
NA,would have said that was subversion and inter-,73
NA,fering with the defence effort. Somebody such as,73
NA,"he, working for the security service-a t the time",73
NA,did not have a security service of this type to,73
NA,protect us-write s out the details which go in a,73
NA,to collect inreport somewhere.,73
NA,The person working in the system has perhaps,73
NA,never been naturalised. At some stage he puts in,73
NA,sughis application to be naturalised. When he puts,73
NA,"in his appUcation, it is denied for various reasons.",73
NA,conseSo the nonourabie member for Dundas has a,73
NA,"word with the Minister about it. The Minister,",73
NA,No being a courteous gentleman in those times-,73
NA,later on when I discussed a similar matter with,73
NA,"the him, he had something on-woul d have said:",73
NA,"'Well, as a matter of fact, perhaps I should not",73
NA,"say this, but he is adversely known'. That is",73
NA,"about all there is to it, adversely known. The par-",73
NA,ticular person I am thinking about was not in-,73
NA,volved in the Darwin matter but in similar activi-,73
NA,ties at another time. His naturalisation was held,73
NA,"the up for many years. As Mr Justice Hope said, this",73
NA,creates injustice that can flow on for a lifetime.,73
NA,This subject is one that can be resolved only,73
NA,"around the table in discussions, which we were",73
NA,"holding last night, about whether we ought to go",73
NA,to a different form of committee discussion on,73
NA,had been breached the legislation.,73
NA,I would not like to have to sit down and to,73
NA,write a definition of subversion any more than I,73
NA,could of liberty or democracy or any such ab-,74
NA,stract subjects. I studied this clause. The drafts-,74
NA,man has been working hard at trying to cover,74
NA,"everything and, in so doing, one might say he",74
NA,covers nothing. There are very few activities that,74
NA,honourable members could indulge in politically,74
NA,that could not be covered under clause 5 (a). Re-,74
NA,member that in dealing with politics one deals,74
NA,"with the nuances of politics, but there are people",74
NA,involved in denning these clauses who are com-,74
NA,mitted perhaps one way or another and living a,74
NA,life of isolation. In many respects that legislation,74
NA,prevents the people who are involved in the Aus-,74
NA,tralian Security Intelligence Organisation from,74
NA,being a general part of the community. It is un-,74
NA,likely that its members belong to the Australian,74
NA,"Labor Party. It is unlikely that they attend, as a",74
NA,"normal thing, the ordinary meetings at which",74
NA,"trade unionists are involved, or even people in-",74
NA,volved in various other activities in the,74
NA,community.,74
NA,My impression is that the security service,74
NA,comes an increasingly isolated life in which an,74
NA,evaluation is likely to be made out of that backministrative,74
NA,"ground. In all these matters, the atmosphere of",74
NA,the day could change dramatically so that we,74
NA,could have a totally different view of the meandefine,74
NA,"ing of subversion, and the people making the",74
NA,judgments would have totally different views.,74
NA,This does create great difficulties. So anything,74
NA,can be obstructing the defence forces. If there is a,74
NA,petrol strike or the people who are supposed to,74
NA,be handling the petrol at Fairbairn Air Force,74
NA,"Base stop the RAAF taking off after a few days,",74
NA,they would be obstructing the Defence Force.,74
NA,"People such as myself, who took part in the",74
NA,onstrations and who gave the encouragement,74
NA,people not to register during the Vietnam,74
NA,"conflict, would be obstructing the development",74
NA,of the Defence Force because we discouraged them,74
NA,people from joining up.,74
NA,Mr Ruddock-Yo u are leaving,74
NA,ditional words: ' . . . for the purposes of,74
NA,security or the defence of the Commonwealth'. It,74
NA,is not just obstructing the Defence Force. It is in,74
NA,the exercise of its functions.,74
Mr BRYANT,I will try to simplify i t -I,74
NA,draw that because I know the honourable gentlethe,74
NA,"man is making an effort to see what it is all about,",74
NA,looked at from my point of view. I have lived doing it.,74
NA,through one of the most turbulent times in Aus-,74
NA,tralian political history.,74
NA,Mr Donald Cameron-Yo u caused it.,74
Mr BRYANT,"A good deal of it, yes, and give",74
NA,brought it to a satisfactory conclusion; we,74
NA,moved you lot from office in 1972. When I first,74
NA,"became involved in politics, the Communist",74
NA,Party Dissolution Bill was one of the principal,74
NA,"factors in public discussion. Nearly everybody,",74
NA,even people who just gave out tickets for the,74
NA,"Labor Party at the referendum, were being",74
NA,"dubbed as communists and so on. Communists,",74
NA,"by definition, were people who were against the",74
NA,defence of the Commonwealth. People were,74
NA,"being judged in an atmosphere which, to most of",74
NA,"us here now, seems so foreign and alien that it is",74
NA,hard to believe. But it could occur again.,74
NA,I think we have embarked upon an almost im-,74
NA,possible task to attempt to define subversion in,74
NA,this way. Most of the people involved in making,74
NA,these judgments are people isolated from the,74
NA,community in many respects. They are making,74
NA,judgments probably from fixations and ob-,74
NA,sessions and prejudices of their own-a s we all,74
NA,must-an d then they are recorded somewhere. It,74
NA,"is true it is not an executive instrument, as I think",74
NA,I heard the honourable member for Lilley ( Mr,74
NA,"beKevin Cairns) say in the course of the debate,",74
NA,but insofar as it helps in the construction of ad-,74
NA,judgments it is a very powerful in-,74
NA,strument for injustice. 1 think this clause sets out,74
NA,on an impossible task. I do not think one can,74
NA,subversion. I think one can define particu-,74
NA,lar acts and that is the best one can do. We have,74
NA,"the Crimes Act, the Defence Act and probably",74
NA,other areas where these matters are defined.,74
NA,"As mentioned in clause 5, activities directed to",74
NA,promoting violence or hatred between different,74
NA,groups of persons in the Australian community,74
NA,"so as to endanger the peace, order or good",74
NA,"demgovernment of the Commonwealth, can include",74
NA,to a lot of people-al l the Government members,74
NA,"who have attacked me so vigorously in the past,",74
NA,and so on. Sometimes I may even have defined,74
NA,in a similar way. I make the point that these,74
NA,are not facts in the strict sense of judgments,74
NA,about people's attitudes and behaviour which,74
NA,out the adcannot be defined.,74
NA,"In ASIO, which we are not just creating but",74
NA,strengthening in its own work rather than in the,74
NA,"nation's work, we are likely to be marching",74
NA,down a path that will perpetuate injustices and,74
NA,withprobably compound them. I do not know that,74
NA,Australian community needs that kind of,74
NA,definition. I think there must be better ways of,74
NA,I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Oppo-,74
NA,sition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) that this provision,74
NA,needs reconsideration. I do not believe we can,74
NA,it consideration in this sort of give and take.,74
NA,reThere must be some way in which we can all sit,74
NA,around and finally put on the statute books,74
NA,"exactly what we mean, if the majority of people",75
NA,think we need to have it defined this way. I do,75
NA,not happen to agree that we need to do it. I know,75
NA,that Australian society has changed in the past,75
NA,30 years. It is a substantially different society,75
NA,"its ethnic background from what it was, but it is",75
NA,"one of the few countries in the world that, in the",75
NA,"strict sense, has never had a traitor. We have",75
NA,never had to shoot anybody for betraying us. On,75
NA,many occasions people have been accused of,75
NA,having done that but we have never had to shoot,75
NA,them. We have never had to shoot any soldiers.,75
NA,"Under the circumstances, we are dealing with a",75
NA,society that is different from most others. ASIO,75
NA,itself was created out of a particular problem at a,75
NA,particular time in the late 1940s. I am not too,75
NA,sure that the legislation and the actual apparatus,75
NA,that we are considering here has not become an,75
NA,anachronism. Perhaps we need to take a fresh,75
NA,look at the whole situation.,75
Mr DONALD CAMERON ,Fadden) quesuons,75
NA,(5.24)- I will be very brief because I cannot see,75
NA,"any real point in taking up the full 10 minutes,",75
NA,"the three previous speakers have done, in the",75
NA,Committee stage. That it is happening underlies,75
NA,once again the plea I made yesterday evening,75
NA,that this matter would be far better discussed,75
NA,a legislation committee because we have spent,75
NA,three hours 10 minutes discussing two words all,75
NA,afternoon. In my second reading speech,75
NA,day night I said that anyone who opposed this,75
NA,particular clause would be opposing motherhood,75
NA,itself. I never really believed that anybody could,75
NA,possibly come out against this clause. But then,75
NA,we heard the quaint interpretation of the prevolving,75
NA,"vious speaker, the honourable member for Wills",75
NA,"( Mr Bryant). I say that with respect, because",75
NA,although often we disagree violently with the,75
NA,"views of the honourable member, there is a feelthen",75
NA,ing of friendship towards him. He cited as,75
NA,example his experience when coming back from,75
NA,the defence of Darwin. I am not sure whether,75
NA,served outside Australia. Did he?,75
NA,Mr Martin-O f course he did. He was a,75
NA,gallant soldier.,75
Mr DONALD CAMERON,He was a soldier examine,75
NA,who had served overseas and in the defence of,75
NA,"Darwin. He talked about a train stoppage,",75
NA,"strike, when he was coming back on leave. There",75
NA,was a strike and the soldiers had to find alternadefence,75
NA,tive means of getting back to Melbourne,75
NA,wherever they were going to take their leave.,75
NA,"That underlies the quaint, shortsighted approach",75
NA,which has been espoused by the honourable,75
NA,member. The fact is that the shipping of armaKillen)-woul,75
NA,ments to men involved in the defence of Darwin,75
NA,and men fighting in the Pacific,75
NA,men who were laying down their lives in the,75
NA,name of this country and in the name of free-,75
NA,"dom, could well have been affected because",75
NA,some stupid shortsighted people back here de-,75
NA,in cided to pull on a strike. As one who is too young,75
NA,"to remember the war, it surprises me to learn that",75
NA,there are members of the Opposition who are,75
NA,quite happy to accept that even in that time of,75
NA,national emergency people just went out on,75
NA,strike as they chose. I have spoken for exactly,75
NA,two and a half minutes. I endorse the preser-,75
NA,vation of the clause in its present form. I am quite,75
NA,sure that the Minister for Employment and,75
NA,"Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner), who is at the table,",75
NA,will be rather stunned.,75
Mr BARRY JONES ,Lalor) (5.27)- I also,75
NA,will try not to take the full 10 minutes which I,75
NA,have at my disposal. I agree that at first glance,75
NA,there is a kind of'motherhood' element in this,75
NA,particular sub-clause. But if we are to ask the,75
NA,that are implicit in the clause as it is,75
NA,"drafted, we have to ask first of all: What is to be",75
NA,as 'regarded as subversion'? Sub-clause (b) states,75
NA,"that it relates, among other things, to 'activities",75
NA,"directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering",75
NA,with the performance of the Defence Force'. We,75
NA,by then go further and ask whether such activities,75
NA,"have to be unlawful. The answer is no, they may",75
NA,"be perfectly lawful. But they are still subversive,",75
NA,on Tueswhether lawful or unlawful.,75
NA,I must admit that it is harder to think in this,75
NA,"case, where something relates specifically to the",75
NA,Defence Force. At least this has the merit of in-,75
NA,a specific identifiable group of people at,75
NA,the other end who have to be subverted. That,75
NA,makes it much more specific. In one way this sub-,75
NA,clause is not quite so vague as sub-clause (a). But,75
NA,we see that the activities to be covered are,75
NA,"an not just unlawful activities, about which we",75
NA,"might very well have consensus in the House, but",75
NA,he activities which are unlawful-presumably-an d,75
NA,also activities which are perfectly lawful. Some,75
NA,other existing Acts may need to be broadened.,75
NA,Perhaps some of the state crimes Acts or some,75
NA,defence Acts need to be broadened. But let us,75
NA,a very well informed criticism of the,75
NA,Defence Force. Supposing we take the criticisms,75
NA,"a expressed in another place by Senator Hamer,",75
NA,"for example, about the ramshackle nature of our",75
NA,operation and how ineffectual it is. If,75
NA,or those words were uttered outside the,75
NA,Parliament-the y were certainly trenchantly,75
NA,"critical and were very deeply resented, as we all",75
NA,"remember, by the Minister for Defence ( Mr",75
NA,d that be regarded as an activity,75
NA,which hinders or interferes with the performance,75
NA,"and in Europe, of the Defence Force?",75
Mr YATES ,No .,76
Mr BARRY JONES,That is absolutely a,76
NA,matter of opinion. In this case I would be pre-,76
NA,pared to accept the opinion of the honourable,76
NA,member for Holt because in many ways he is an,76
NA,old-fashioned liberal. I think his judgment could,76
NA,be relied upon more than the judgments of some,76
NA,"of the more rabid members of the Liberal Party,",76
NA,not to mention the members of the National,76
NA,Country Party. If we want to equate subversion,76
NA,"with unlawful activity, that is all right. But if we",76
NA,"are talking about general activities, I am con-",76
NA,cerned about how broad the dragnet can become,76
NA,by the elimination of a single word. We are talk-,76
NA,ing about onus on proof-abou t whether it,76
NA,should be taken for granted that the activities of,76
NA,ordinary citizens are to be regarded as legal un-,76
NA,"less there is some prescription to the contrary, or",76
NA,"whether we say: 'Oh no, we are going to work on",76
NA,the basis that the powers to be conferred on the,76
NA,Australian Security Intelligence Organisation are,76
NA,to be carried out perfectly legally; it is to have the,76
NA,broadest possible range of powers. We believe,76
NA,"that if there is to be any infringement on liberty,",76
NA,it must be on the liberty of the subject and not on,76
NA,the liberty of the organisation.' I think that is an,76
NA,absolutely unacceptable dichotomy.,76

NA,to an estimates committee is finally agreed to by the,77
NA,"House, a future day shall be fixed, on motion,",77
NA,third reading.,77
NA,The discussions that were held by the Standing,77
NA,Orders Committee are reflected in the report,77
NA,which is being distributed to honourable,77
NA,members. It recommends some modifications of,77
NA,the original draft sessional orders which were cir-,77
NA,culated to honourable members at the end of the,77
NA,autumn session. The proposals take into account,77
NA,what I believe is a reasonable compromise be-,77
NA,tween the concern of all members of this House,77
NA,"to get these Estimates committees started, at",77
NA,"least on a trial basis, the concern of the Govern-",77
NA,ment to ensure that its program will be,77
NA,completed and the concern of the Opposition to,77
NA,ensure that there will be an adequate oppor-,77
NA,tunity within the procedures of the Parliament,77
NA,for members to examine the Estimates in the,77
NA,manner that they believe necessary.,77
NA,"Quite obviously, our difficulty is the necessity",77
NA,for the Government to provide adequate debat-,77
NA,ing opportunities in this Parliament for a number,77
NA,of legislative measures which are either on the,77
NA,Notice Paper or are yet to be introduced. We are,77
NA,"concerned that at the same time, in the scrutiny",77
NA,"of these estimates, we must ensure that this com-",77
NA,mittee system shall work. There is therefore a,77
NA,number of procedures which will certainly re-,77
NA,quire co-operation between the Opposition and,77
NA,the Government. I can assure the Opposition that,77
NA,it is my intention to co-operate with it as far as,77
NA,possible to ensure that its particular concerns are,77
NA,met. I hope that in turn I will receive the co-,77
NA,operation of the Opposition. I believe that as a,77
NA,result the Estimates committees in the form,77
NA,"envisaged could be given a fair trial. Obviously, a",77
NA,number of debates will be held in this chamber,77
NA,which might make it difficult for the Estimates,77
NA,committees to meet. Divisions or other matters,77
NA,will require the attendance of members in this,77
NA,chamber. It is the intention of the Manager of,77
NA,Opposition Business ( Mr Young) and me to con-,77
NA,"fer and to try to ensure that, as far as possible,",77
NA,or expressions of opinion of,77
NA,Estimates committees will not meet when those,77
NA,"matters are taking place. Accordingly, it is the in-",77
NA,tention that there be reference on the daily,77
NA,program to the particular committee or com-,77
NA,the con- mittees which will be meeting on that day. I hope,77
NA,that honourable members will take note of that,77
NA,program. It will also be possible for them to get,77
NA,an overall idea of when the particular com-,77
NA,mittees in which they have a specific interest will,77
NA,be meeting so that their membership within their,77
NA,party arrangements can be accommodated.,77
NA,A further motion will be necessary to im-,77
NA,plement those detailed procedures. The motion,77
NA,that I have just moved sets down the framework.,77
NA,for the The next motion that I will move will set down,77
NA,the particular estimates to be referred to the,77
NA,committees and the program for those com-,77
NA,mittees. I hope that some flexibility will be per-,77
NA,"mitted in this regard for, as I have suggested,",77
NA,"there might well be occasions when, because of",77
NA,the occurrence of debates in this chamber on the,77
NA,day when it is suggested in the daily program,77
NA,"that Estimates committees will meet, it might not",77
NA,be practicable as a result of the discussions be-,77
NA,tween the Manager of Opposition Business and,77
NA,me for the Estimates committees to meet. It,77
NA,could mean that there will have to be some,77
NA,adjustments to the program over the course of,77
NA,the period that we have set down. It is my inten-,77
NA,tion to resume the debate on the Appropriation,77
NA,Bill on Tuesday so that the Estimates committee,77
NA,"can at least meet on that day and, I hope, start",77
NA,the procedure.,77
NA,I presume that the program after that will de-,77
NA,pend a little on how far the House progresses on,77
NA,the other matters before it that are temporarily,77
NA,adjourned. But on Tuesday we will return to the,77
NA,Appropriation Bill and enable the Estimates,77
NA,committees to commence their deliberations,77
NA,"and, I hope, to commence the procedure and",77
NA,"practice. If it can be arranged, I will therefore be",77
NA,moving the other motion for reference to the,77
NA,committees later this day.,77
Mr YOUNG ,Port Adelaide) (5.39)- Mr,78
NA,"Speaker, as you know, a week in politics is a long",78
NA,time. A week ago it did not seem possible that we,78
NA,would reach this stage with this matter. The Op-,78
NA,position welcomes the opportunity to experiment,78
NA,with the Estimates committees. We have reached,78
NA,some understanding as to how they will operate.,78
NA,That was not available to us prior to the meeting,78
NA,of the Standing Orders Committee yesterday.,78
NA,We led a very powerful delegation to it and were,78
NA,able to persuade those present that perhaps the,78
NA,Opposition had some right to have some say in,78
NA,these matters.,78
NA,It appears that the committees will be able to,78
NA,give a great deal more time to scrutinising the Es-,78
NA,timates than was possible in the Committee of,78
NA,"the Whole. In fact, some people have suggested",78
NA,that the way in which the estimates were dealt,78
NA,with in debates previously was really a bit of a,78
NA,"joke, given the role of the Senate and the long-",78
NA,winded second reading debate that took place on,78
NA,the Budget. This will give us a more specific op-,78
NA,portunity to question Ministers and perhaps get,78
NA,answers from the bureaucracy than was pre-,78
NA,viously available to us.,78
NA,I do not underestimate the ability of my col-,78
NA,"leagues on both sides of the Senate, but I think",78
NA,we have a fair bit of talent in this House as well.,78
NA,We should be given the opportunity to compete,78
NA,"with them. As I said yesterday, I think it is more",78
NA,the responsibility of this House than of the,78
NA,Senate to carry out this task. I do not know that,78
NA,"Sir John Kerr would agree with me, but that is",78
NA,the point of view I hold.,78
NA,I think that the manner in which we have been,78
NA,able to resolve this matter in that the two com-,78
NA,mittees will meet over the period from next Tues-,78
NA,day to the third week in October and both com-,78
NA,mittees will be dealing with no more than two,78
NA,departments per day with the time allocated and,78
NA,the times for the meetings being placed on the,78
NA,daily program each morning gives all members,78
NA,of the House an excellent opportunity to be able,78
NA,"to arrange their day-thei r party meetings, their",78
NA,"House duties, et cetera-s o that they can attend",78
NA,either as a member or observer at the meetings of,78
NA,the Estimates committees and see whether they,78
NA,work. I would urge those honourable members,78
NA,who do not intend to participate in the activities,78
NA,of either ofthe committees to go along to a meet-,78
NA,ing and see for themselves whether they are fruit-,78
NA,ful in the running of the House. I believe that the,78
NA,procedure of letting honourable members know,78
NA,what is to occur will be beneficial to them. The,78
NA,times set down for the committees to meet seems,78
NA,to be ample. According to advice received from,78
NA,"the Government, the Committee of the Whole",78
NA,dealt with the Estimates last year for 21Vi hours.,78
NA,On this occasion we are to have something like,78
NA,"46 hours, taking into account the time taken up",78
NA,by both committees in looking at the estimates.,78
NA,So ample time is being provided.,78
NA,One problem still to be discussed with the,78
NA,Leader of the House ( Mr Sinclair) is the amount,78
NA,of time we will have to debate the committees',78
NA,reports to the Committee of the Whole. We,78
NA,know that that is something that cannot be,78
NA,solved at the moment in terms of defining that,78
NA,"time, but if the committees do not take up all the",78
NA,time that is allocated to them and if the Govern-,78
NA,ment continues as it has for the last four years,78
NA,with the policy of not having very important,78
NA,"business dealt with by the House, we will be able",78
NA,to give proper discussion to the reports as they,78
NA,come back here. I hope that we can overcome,78
NA,that problem.,78
NA,Another matter which will have to be the sub-,78
NA,ject of discussion between the Leader of the,78
NA,House and me is what is to be debated in the,78
NA,House when the Estimates committees meet. The,78
NA,"Opposition has indicated that, if the Budget de-",78
NA,"bate continues, it will have no objection to the",78
NA,Estimates committees meeting at the same time.,78
NA,We will have to play that by ear and see what,78
NA,legislation comes before the House. If we con-,78
NA,sider it to be of such importance and we want,78
NA,people readily on hand to come into the House to,78
NA,"take part in debates, obviously we would not",78
NA,want the Estimates committees to meet at such a,78
NA,time.,78
NA,The Standing Orders Committee also took into,78
NA,account the fact that one of the committees may,78
NA,make approaches to meet outside the normal sit-,78
NA,ting hours of the House. I do not think that is,78
NA,likely. The attitude of most honourable members,78
NA,"in this day and age, is that from Monday night to",78
NA,Friday morning is long enough to be in Canberra,78
NA,and we like to return to our electorates. Never-,78
NA,"theless, we have made provision for leave of the",78
NA,House to be given should a committee find it,78
NA,necessary to meet outside the normal sitting,78
NA,times of the House. I hope we have found a suc-,78
NA,cessful way in which to experiment with a little,78
NA,more reform of the House of Representatives.,78
NA,Reform of institutions of this nature is very slow.,78
NA,"Nonetheless the Labor Party, as the party of re-",78
NA,"form, has moved quickly to accommodate the",78
NA,suggestion put to it by the Government. I hope,78
NA,"that it will work out. I put it to you, Mr Speaker,",78
NA,that the Opposition feels that it would be in order,78
NA,for the Standing Orders Committee to review the,78
NA,operation of these committees. If we do run into,78
NA,"problems, perhaps that Committee could meet",78
NA,"again and do as it did yesterday, that is, over-",79
NA,come the objections of both sides.,79
Mr YATES ,Holt) (5.43)-Let anyone should,79
NA,gain the impression that the Opposition is the,79
NA,"sole and only party of reform, I think I should",79
NA,point out that there is a large number of private,79
NA,members on this side of the House who are just,79
NA,as interested and active as the Opposition in,79
NA,examining government expenditure and in en-,79
NA,suring that the Executive does not exceed itself.,79
NA,"That is the reason why, about a fortnight ago, I",79
NA,made rather a violent speech during the adjourn-,79
NA,ment debate pressing for reforms of this nature.,79
NA,The framework of these committees is sensible. I,79
NA,hope that their establishent will receive the full,79
NA,support of the House. It is only charitable that I,79
NA,should say to the Leader of the House ( Mr,79
NA,Sinclair) that those private members on this side,79
NA,of the House who have been actively involved in,79
NA,seeking reforms of this sort are grateful. I assure,79
NA,the House that we will play a full part in the op-,79
NA,eration of these committees.,79
Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (5.44)-Someone,79
NA,famous once said that he was taking a small step.,79
NA,I think that a more liberal attitude- I use the ex-,79
NA,pression hesitantly-toward s the manner in,79
NA,which the legislation and Estimates committees,79
NA,are used can help this House to perform the func-,79
NA,tions its members are elected to perform. Those,79
NA,functions are twofold. One is to provide a rep-,79
NA,"resentative forum in which to examine and, in",79
NA,"the case of honourable members opposite, to",79
NA,support the actions of the government of the day,79
NA,and the other is to provide a representative,79
NA,forum of the people of Australia in order to,79
NA,ensure that the government of the day is under,79
NA,constant scrutiny by the only body which has a,79
NA,realistic chance of performing that role. Because,79
NA,of an accident of numbers some years ago which,79
NA,denied the then government a majority member-,79
NA,"ship of the Senate and, I think it is fair to",79
NA,cause of the reformist zeal of Mr Justice Murphy,79
NA,when Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and,79
NA,"of other members of the Senate, the Senate's",79
NA,procedures have changed dramatically over the,79
NA,last 10 years. It undertook roles which were the,79
NA,responsibility of this House.,79
NA,In fact one of those roles was the establish-,79
NA,ment of Estimates committees which deal in de-,79
NA,tail with the actual line and form of the Esti-,79
NA,mates. One of the results of that situation is that,79
NA,now we have available a detailed and prepared,79
NA,set of estimates of Departments in muchfinerde-,79
NA,tail than ever existed before. I am not sure,79
NA,"whether the Departments like that, but certainly",79
NA,it means that a closer examination is possible,79
NA,merely because that information is available.,79
NA,This particular reform will work if the com-,79
NA,mittees function as we see they should. At this,79
NA,stage I think we all have varying views on how,79
NA,they should in fact operate. We are now,79
NA,confronted with the problem of determining the,79
NA,actual method of operation in the very short time,79
NA,that is left before the committees operate. Cer-,79
NA,"tainly, I would have liked to have seen this",79
NA,motion accompanied by a motion which would,79
NA,have required a re-examination of the operations,79
NA,of committees after this session of Parliament is,79
NA,"over. Then no one could say: 'Well, we will have",79
NA,a look at the situation sometime'. I would have,79
NA,liked this to be a terminal resolution that had to,79
NA,be re-adopted as a fresh set of sessional orders,79
NA,prior to the next Budget session. I again make,79
NA,reference to the fact that the reform of Parlia-,79
NA,ment should be a continuing process. I believe,79
NA,that reform is not within the ambit of the Stand-,79
NA,ing Orders Committee whose report ultimately,79
NA,"brings the reform to the Parliament, but as an in-",79
NA,cidental occurrence rather than as an initiative.,79
NA,We still have before us the report of the Joint,79
NA,Committee on the Parliamentary Committee,79
NA,System which examined this matter in extreme,79
NA,detail and which carried out its work during the,79
NA,period of two governments. The report was,79
NA,ultimately presented to the Parliament when the,79
NA,Committee was under the chairmanship of the,79
NA,"President of the Senate, Sir Magnus Cormack.",79
NA,"That report made numerous suggestions, some",79
NA,of which are probably dated already by changes,79
NA,in procedures. But one of the more significant,79
NA,recommendations was the suggested creation in,79
NA,this House of a procedures committee. There has,79
NA,been on the Notice Paper since March of this,79
NA,year a Notice of Motion in my name for the es-,79
NA,"tablishment of that committee, although I do not",79
NA,claim credit for originating that idea. I believe,79
NA,"say, bethat if back bench members of the Government",79
NA,who have shown an interest in the reform of Par-,79
NA,liament take up the cause of that committee and,79
NA,"allow that motion to be debated by the House,",79
NA,we will take major steps forward in the manner,79
NA,in which this House operates. As members ofthe,79
NA,Parliament we can consider what is the best and,79
NA,"most effective structure of the Parliament, and",79
NA,the means by which members of Parliament can,79
NA,best carry out the functions for which they are,79
NA,elected. I have always felt that the best results in,79
NA,the examination of our procedures come from,79
NA,honourable members collectively putting their,79
NA,own points of view. Governments of whatever,79
NA,colour have a vested interest in the procedures of,79
NA,this Parliament which is different from that of the,79
NA,honourable members.,79
NA,Obviously the Leader of the House ( Mr,80
NA,Sinclair) has a very definite responsibility. He,80
NA,has to keep to the Government's legislation,80
NA,program. The members of the House have a,80
NA,different responsibility. Their responsibility,80
NA,scrutinise the legislation of the Government to,80
NA,the extent that it is possible and within their,80
NA,"power to bring about changes, without unduly",80
NA,taxing the time of the House and without in fact,80
NA,making it impossible for the actual performance,80
NA,of honourable members' duties other than those,80
NA,that they have in this Parliament. This reform is,80
NA,long overdue. Whether it will work will very,80
NA,much depend on how successfully the forms and,80
NA,the procedures of these committees can be estab-,80
NA,"lished without prior experience, and without real",80
NA,prior consideration by the Parliament or its,80
NA,members. I believe that future reforms depend,80
NA,on goodwill and on a continual examination of,80
NA,our procedures with continual recommendations,80
NA,on change. I believe that situation depends on,80
NA,the ultimate estabUshment of a procedures com-,80
NA,mittee and I ask the House to move to that mat-,80
NA,ter quickly.,80
Mr HYDE ,Moore) (5.49)-This is a relanipotent,80
NA,tively small but significant step in the improveat,80
NA,ment of procedures in this chamber. The ally,80
NA,chamber should note that it came from the work,80
NA,of private members of the chamber. For the,80
NA,record and with appreciation I would like,80
NA,chamber to note the work that was done in danger,80
NA,developing these committees over quite some,80
NA,time by a group of back bench members on this,80
NA,side of the House. On behalf of that group,80
NA,thank both the Government and members of the,80
NA,Opposition who co-operated in that venture.,80
Mr BRYANT ,Wills) (5.50)- I want to promible.,80
NA,ulgate an idea which will be regarded as a major,80
NA,"heresy. In fact, it may well be regarded as",80
NA,"versive under the terms of the Australian Securview,",80
NA,ity Intelligence Organisation Bill which we,80
NA,discussing.,80
Mr SINCLAIR ,"Preachin g succession, are you,",80
NA,Gordon?,80
Mr BRYANT,"Yes, that is right. The problem",80
NA,that I see is that when we start on the Estimates,80
NA,we look at history. We sit there and drag infornecessary,80
NA,mation out of people and make an input of,80
NA,"sort, but that is about all that we will do.",80
NA,"time is long past, I think, when the Parliament",80
NA,had some input into the construction of the,80
NA,Estimates. I do not regard that statement as,80
NA,"heresy, as do some of my more progressive colwhen",80
NA,"leagues. For instance, there are thousands of",80
NA,people scattered throughout the Australian Pubdo,80
NA,lic Service who for a number of months before,80
NA,the final construction of the Budget have had,80
NA,their input. They draw up the estimates for their,80
NA,little section and it is sent through the system.,80
NA,Their estimates are analysed at departmental,80
NA,is to and various other levels. Some of those people,80
NA,have been elected to this Parliament although 1,80
NA,"am not one of them, of course. When they are",80
NA,elected to this Parliament they are not allowed to,80
NA,take part in any sort of discussion like that. 1 do,80
NA,not think it would be difficult at an early stage in,80
NA,the consideration of the Estimates to have the,80
NA,apparatus of departments and Ministers placed,80
NA,at the disposal of the ParUament so that some,80
NA,ideas can be put into the Estimates from the elec-,80
NA,torates which we represent. This is a collective re-,80
NA,sponsibility which we have.,80
NA,Of course the final decision about the actual,80
NA,priorities could well be left to the departments,80
NA,and the Ministers. I can see no real difficulties in,80
NA,that sort of system at all. I hope that each of us,80
NA,has a more intimate knowledge of problems of,80
NA,the communities which we represent than even,80
NA,the most gifted person in the Public Service or,80
NA,"even the most gifted, wise, omniscient and om-",80
NA,Ministers such as those who are sitting,80
NA,the table. I therefore hope that we will eventu-,80
NA,get around to that sort of approach. Perhaps,80
NA,the Ministers at the table had better agree to that,80
NA,now so that when they are on this side of the,80
NA,the House again-the y wouid both be in serious,80
NA,at an election-the y will be able to take,80
NA,part in Estimates committees instead of being on,80
NA,the outer. 1 thank honourable members opposite,80
NA,I who took the matter up and who have managed,80
NA,to persuade the fairly difficult and incorrigible,80
NA,people on the other side of the House with whom,80
NA,"we have to deal at times, for making this poss-",80
NA,"They have succeeded. Mr Speaker, while I",80
NA,think that sometimes you might be a bit rough on,80
NA,subus when it comes to our expressing a point of,80
NA,you rapidly called the Standing Orders,80
NA,are Committee together. The firm hand you applied,80
NA,to the meeting yesterday has made something,80
NA,happen in 24 hours which has taken about 24,80
NA,years in gestation. Of course this makes eleph-,80
NA,ants look pretty spritely.,80
Dr BLEWETT ,Bonython) (5.54)-As it was,80
NA,yesterday to make a protest about our,80
NA,some non-involvement in the evolution of these,80
NA,"The schemes, I take this opportunity today to con-",80
NA,gratulate those back bench members of the,80
NA,Government who were responsible for the evol-,80
NA,ution of this scheme. I hope that in the future,80
NA,efforts are made to reform this institution-,80
NA,and I believe that is necessary-w e will be able to,80
NA,that activity at least co-operatively. I also,80
NA,think that this is an important advance in what I,80
NA,see as being a major institutional struggle in this,81
NA,country between the two Houses of this Parlia-,81
NA,ment. It always seemed to me to be an anomaly,81
NA,that the Senate should have Estimates com-,81
NA,"mittees and that this House, which, whatever the",81
NA,"debate, is certainly the primary House in the field",81
NA,"of finance, did not have such committees.",81
NA,I think it was regrettable that when the Joint,81
NA,Committee on Committees for the Parliament,81
NA,"examined these issues, although it recognised the",81
NA,prior claims of the House of Representatives in,81
NA,finance it nevertheless decided against recom-,81
NA,mending the establishment of Estimates com-,81
NA,mittees for this House. I think that in making this,81
NA,decision today a minor but significant gain has,81
NA,been made in what we see as being a vital insti-,81
NA,"tutional struggle in this country. Of course, it is",81
NA,now up to the members of this House to make,81
NA,sure that our Estimates committees work more,81
NA,"successfully than, according to rumour do some",81
NA,of the Senate Estimates committees.,81
Mr SPEAKER,"Befor e I put the question, I",81
NA,indicate that the co-operation that existed in the,81
NA,House in achieving this reform was something,81
NA,that was welcomed by me. The members of the,81
NA,Standing Orders Committee were very glad to,81
NA,have the opportunity to play a role in bringing,81
NA,"the matter to finality yesterday,",81
NA,willing to stand at the service of the House at any,81

NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,81
NA,AUSTRALIAN SECURITY,81
NA,INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION BILL,81
NA,1979,81
NA,In Committee,81
NA,Consideration resumed.,81
Mr CARLTON ,Mackellar) (8.2)-We are,81
NA,clause 5 (1) (b) of the Australian Se-,81
NA,curity Intelligence Organization Bill to which the,81
NA,Opposition has moved an amendment which,81
NA,seeks to insert the word 'unlawful' before the,81
NA,Comword 'activities'. The clause at present provides,81
NA,that activities regarded as subversion will,81
NA,include:,81
NA,"activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering",81
NA,with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions,81
NA,or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Common-,81
NA,wealth for the purposes of security or the defence of the,81
NA,Commonwealth;,81
NA,The Opposition seeks to insert the word 'unlaw-,81
NA,ful' before the word 'activities'so that before the,81
NA,Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is,81
NA,able to regard an activity as a matter requiring,81
NA,attention that activity should be unlawful. There,81
NA,are a couple of points I would like to make about,81
NA,this. The first is that activities have to be directed,81
NA,"to obstructing, hindering, et cetera. It is not",81
NA,enough that the activities simply obstruct or,81
NA,"hinder, et cetera. For example, something could",82
NA,"happen inadvertently. The defence forces, in the",82
NA,"course of their duties, may be obstructed by",82
NA,something on the road which had got there for,82
NA,whatever reason-,82
NA,Mr Barry Jones-Bu t not unlawful activities.,82
Mr CARLTON,The honourable member for,82
NA,Lalor will please restrain himself. I am coming to,82
NA,that point. The fact is that the activities must be,82
NA,"directed to obstructing. In other words, there",82
NA,"must be some intention to obstruct. For example,",82
NA,there has to be an intention to obstruct the de-,82
NA,"fence forces in the performance of their duty, not",82
NA,just some activity that they may be engaged in,82
NA,but activity which is for the purposes of security,82
NA,or defence of the Commonwealth. On the in-,82
NA,terpretation of this particular clause there is that,82
NA,restriction.,82
NA,"As with all the clauses in the ASIO Bill, there",82
NA,a question of judgment on the part of ASIO as to,82
NA,what is considered subversive under this particu-,82
NA,lar clause. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,82
NA,( Mr Lionel Bowen) has suggested-an d I am,82
NA,grateful to him for raising this example-tha t,82
NA,there could be industrial activities which could,82
NA,obstruct the Defence Force in the performance,82
NA,of its functions. One could easily imagine some-,82
NA,"thing happening on the wharves, as the honour-",82
NA,"able member suggested, which might make it",82
NA,impossible for the Army or the Navy to receive,82
NA,materials which may be essential for a particular,82
NA,defence purpose. Therefore the point is that,82
NA,although these activities may not be strictly un-,82
NA,lawful under the Conciliation and Arbitration,82
NA,"Act, nonetheless the Australian Security Intelli-",82
NA,gence Organisation may feel that it is obliged to,82
NA,build up a file on those engaged in these activi-,82
NA,ties. This is a very interesting example because it,82
NA,raises quite an important point.,82
NA,I think that it would be possible to have a trade,82
NA,union activity which in itself was lawful but,82
NA,which was being engaged in with the objective of,82
NA,obstructing the defence forces in the perform-,82
NA,ance of their legitimate duties. 1 think we have to,82
NA,be very realistic in our consideration of this mat-,82
NA,ter because there are certain elements within the,82
NA,"trade union movement-an d I hasten to add, be-",82
NA,fore anybody from the Opposition side jumps on,82
NA,"me, that they are extreme minority elements-",82
NA,which would not be democratic in their inten-,82
NA,tions. It is conceivable that such people could,82
NA,make use of an industrial situation to carry out,82
NA,activities which were designed to restrain the de-,82
NA,fence forces in their legitimate activities.,82
NA,"The situation, in the present context, is per-",82
NA,haps not as serious as it could be in a future con-,82
NA,text. I draw the Committee's attention to the re-,82
NA,cent decisions taken at the Australian Labor,82
NA,Party Conference in Adelaide. This is quite im-,82
NA,portant because within the decisions of the con-,82
NA,ference in Adelaide were a number of resolutions,82
NA,which related to the legal position of trade,82
NA,unions and trade unionists. Resolutions were,82
NA,passed at that conference which sought to re-,82
NA,move the activities of unionists from judical,82
NA,oversight in very significant respects. I suggest,82
NA,that the Committee should regard this with the,82
NA,utmost seriousness. As this legislation presum-,82
NA,ably will last for a number of years and as it is not,82
NA,inconceivable-peris h the thought-tha t there,82
NA,"could be a change of government, and as the",82
NA,principal Opposition party has decided at its,82
NA,annual conference that the trade union move-,82
NA,ment will be removed from certain judicial re-,82
NA,"straints, legal restraints, it is quite possible that",82
NA,is trade unionists could be in a position of being,82
NA,able to indulge in certain activities which are,82
NA,quite legal under Commonwealth law but which,82
NA,quite clearly could obstruct the defence forces in,82
NA,their essential duties.,82
NA,I am not drawing a long bow here in any re-,82
NA,spect because the principal Opposition party,82
NA,passed at its Adelaide conference a number of,82
NA,resolutions which would remove trade unions,82
NA,and trade unionists from legal restraint. I point,82
NA,out that its resolutions are binding on the parlia-,82
NA,mentary members of its Party. Within that con-,82
NA,"text, I think it would be essential for a security in-",82
NA,telligence organisation to be able to make a,82
NA,"determination of its own as to whether activities,",82
NA,which under the statutory arrangements were,82
NA,"lawful or unlawful, were directed to obstructing,",82
NA,hindering or interfering with the performance by,82
NA,the Defence Force of its functions out of other,82
NA,activities by or for the Commonwealth for the,82
NA,purposes of security or the defence of the Com-,82
NA,"monwealth. I think, therefore, that it is essential",82
NA,for us to retain this clause in its present form.,82
NA,There is a secondary argument which I think I,82
NA,should mention. I should think that under the,82
NA,"various defence Acts-again , I am not totally",82
NA,familiar with all aspects of the law-activitie s,82
NA,"directed to obstructing, hindering, et cetera",82
NA,"would be, ipso facto, illegal. I cannot imagine",82
NA,that the Defence Act or the various laws relating,82
NA,to the defence forces would allow members of,82
NA,"the general population to obstruct, hinder or in-",82
NA,terfere with the performance of those forces,82
NA,when they were engaging in activities for the,82
NA,purposes of security or the defence of the Com-,82
NA,"monwealth, without deeming them to be acting",82
NA,"illegally. To a degree, one could say that under",83
NA,this clause activities directed to doing those,83
NA,things would be illegal anyway. I would not want,83
NA,to have a situation in which a person employed,83
NA,by the Security Intelligence Organisation had to,83
NA,think about 400 times whether a particular ac-,83
NA,tivity was strictly legal or illegal before that per-,83
NA,son observed it as something which was poten-,83
NA,tially subversive.,83
NA,It is important to retain this sub-clause in its,83
NA,original condition. I do not think that the Oppo-,83
NA,"sition's amendment is a good one. In particular, I",83
NA,do not think that it is wise to accept this amend-,83
NA,"ment, in view of the decisions of the Australian",83
NA,Labor Party Conference in Adelaide which,83
NA,sought to remove the trade union movement and,83
NA,members of unions from judicial restraint. Under,83
NA,"that decision, if it were enacted by a Labor",83
NA,"government, the Security Intelligence Organis-",83
NA,ation would be quite restrained specifically by,83
NA,this clause from taking note of activities which,83
NA,could be absolutely subversive because of the,83
NA,particular quirk of the government of the day as,83
NA,to what it regarded as legal or illegal.,83
Mr BARRY JONES ,Lalor) (8.12)-Let me,83
NA,just go through the point about the word 'unlaw-,83
NA,"ful ' again, to show the absolute hollowness of the",83
NA,argument that is put forward. We might be able,83
NA,to solve the problem by putting in a compromise,83
NA,wording. Let us suppose that we changed the,83
NA,wording slightly-absolutel y in accord with what,83
NA,the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr,83
NA,Carlton) said. Let us suppose that we changed,83
NA,clause 5 (1) (b) to say that things to be'regarded,83
NA,as subversion' include 'lawful or unlawful activi-,83
NA,ties'. If we say 'lawful or unlawful activities' the,83
NA,real hollowness of the argument comes through,83
NA,because what is being said is simply that activi-,83
NA,ties that are defined as perfectly lawful are still to,83
NA,be deemed to be subversive. When,83
NA,"that way, 1 do not think that there is anyone on",83
NA,the Government side who would accept that,83
NA,wording; Government members would say: 'No;,83
NA,we do not want to find ourselves committed in,83
NA,statute to saying that lawful activity,83
NA,too'. But that is the logic of it.,83
NA,Mr Ruddock-Ho w about'permitted'?,83
Mr BARRY JONES,I find that suggestion,83
NA,about 'permitted' very objectionable because,83
NA,very often there is a basic assumption that civil,83
NA,liberties in Australia is what is left over after,83
NA,"police, Customs, the Australian Security Intellifirst",83
NA,gence Organisation and various other authorities,83
NA,have had their go. They say to the ordinary citithe,83
NA,zen: 'What is left over is yours. That is what,83
NA,are permitted to do'. I do not believe that there,83
NA,a single Government member here who would,83
NA,accept an amendment which said that clause,83
NA,5 (1) (b) would begin with the words 'lawful or,83
NA,unlawful activities'. If those words were adopted,83
NA,it would reveal the absolute hollowness of what,83
NA,is being done; it would reveal just how wide the,83
NA,dragnet is being cast.,83
NA,I do not think for a minute that some honour-,83
NA,able members opposite have thought this thing,83
NA,through seriously. They have taken it for granted,83
NA,that there has to be an organisation which will,83
NA,protect society and that all the Government has,83
NA,to do is to say that that organisation has its own,83
NA,reasons. One of the most horrifying remarks that,83
NA,I have heard-i t is horrifying because of its,83
NA,implications-cam e from the honourable,83
NA,member for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock) this after-,83
NA,noon. I am sure that he did not think it through.,83
NA,His argument was: If people have nothing to be,83
NA,"ashamed of, what have they to be frightened of if",83
NA,ASIO is surveilling their activities? We could,83
NA,come to the stage where we accept that it is a per-,83
NA,"fectly normal and routine thing, say, for tele-",83
NA,phones to be tapped. I remember going to a pub-,83
NA,"lic meeting in Auckland, New Zealand in 1977",83
NA,on this issue and being horrified. One fellow got,83
NA,up and said:' I have strong evidence that my tele-,83
NA,"phone is being tapped; but I do not mind, be-",83
NA,cause I have nothing to hide. Why should anyone,83
NA,in this society be worried if his telephone is tap-,83
NA,"ped, i f the people all have clean consciences?'",83
NA,"Once we accept that basic premise and say 'Yes,",83
NA,it is all right if they tap our telephone and it is all,83
NA,right if they intercept our mail. We all have clean,83
NA,"consciences. They can do what they like', it",83
NA,means immediately that the rights of the private,83
NA,citizen are annihilated.,83
NA,Mr Carlton-Bu t that is not suggested.,83
Mr BARRY JONES,No. I am simply saying,83
NA,it is put in that once we accept i t -,83
NA,Mr Carlton-Tha t is totally unacceptable.,83
Mr BARRY JONES,I am glad to hear the,83
NA,a honourable member say that. I am glad to see an,83
NA,is subversive element of spirit.,83
Mr YATES ,Ther e has to be a warrant.,83
Mr BARRY JONES,"I am aware of that. But,",83
NA,once the dragnet has been cast so wide that it,83
NA,encompasses unlawful and lawful activities and,83
NA,the Government says 'They are to be regarded as,83
NA,"the part of the process of surveillance', that is the",83
NA,step towards some kind of police state where,83
NA,the rights of the citizen are qualified and where,83
NA,rights of the security organisation are unlimi-,83
NA,you ted; where the Parliament keeps putting re-,83
NA,is straints on itself and keeps giving carte blanche,83
NA,to somebody else. What this debate is all about is,84
NA,that there are honourable members in this,84
NA,chamber who say of themselves: 'We cannot be,84
NA,trusted with power; they can. We do not mind,84
NA,"limiting our power, but we will give all the more",84
NA,power to them because their judgment is better,84
NA,than our judgment'. What sort of a democratic,84
NA,parliamentary institution are we if we really are,84
NA,abdicating our rights and saying to somebody,84
NA,else: 'You take them. You go away with them.,84
NA,You can be trusted with them; we cannot'?,84
Mr YATES ,Holt) (8.17)- I am just trying to,84
NA,get back to the actual clause. What this operation,84
NA,is all about is something perfectly simple. It is,84
NA,"whether the Organisation shall have the right, at",84
NA,"its discretion, after a warrant has been issued",84
NA,"when it comes to telephone tapping, to make a",84
NA,report on a situation which it thinks is correct and,84
NA,"justifiable. Therefore, I agree with my friend, the",84
NA,"honourable member for Lalor ( Mr Barry Jones),",84
NA,"that there is an element of trust involved in this,",84
NA,and this Committee has to decide this evening,84
NA,whether it is going to insist on not putting in 'un-,84
NA,lawful'. That in itself would not succeed. It,84
NA,would put another onus upon those who have to,84
NA,do the reporting work. They would then have to,84
NA,consider whether they were going to make a re-,84
NA,port because they thought that the activity was,84
NA,unlawful.,84
NA,I do not think that an organisation set up to,84
NA,look after the affairs of our country can operate,84
NA,within that parameter. I understand my friend's,84
NA,"objections, but I must come down in support of",84
NA,my friend on this side of the chamber-th e,84
NA,honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr,84
NA,Carlton). I do not want the Opposition to think,84
NA,that we are always concerned with the problems,84
NA,of just the trade unions or the very extreme el-,84
NA,ements in the trade unions. We are not. We are,84
NA,sometimes involved in a situation in which the,84
NA,Defence Act might be called into operation and,84
NA,the Services called upon to aid the civil power. In,84
NA,"those cases, if somebody obstructs the forces",84
NA,"called to aid the civil power, surely a report can",84
NA,be made upon the person who is doing the,84
NA,obstructing.,84
Mr LES JOHNSON ,Yo u are very prone to giv-,84
NA,ing that kind of thing a licence.,84
Mr YATES,Th e honourable member has,84
NA,made his speech and has given his views. I am,84
NA,sure that we paid attention to them. Surely he,84
NA,must show us the courtesy of allowing us to ex-,84
NA,plain our views. I have done so. The more one,84
NA,"thinks about it, the more one has sympathy",84
NA,the point made by the Minister for Employment,84
NA,"and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner), and my friend the",84
NA,"honourable member for Mackellar, that to put in",84
NA,the word 'unlawful' would make the situation,84
NA,"even more difficult. Therefore, the Committee",84
NA,would be very well advised to leave out the word,84
NA,'unlawful'.,84
Mr BRYANT ,Wills) (8.20)-The honourable,84
NA,member for Mackellar ( Mr Carlton) confirmed,84
NA,our worst fears. The moment we come to some,84
NA,form of definition of what we mean here he turns,84
NA,to the Australian Labor Party's policy and,84
NA,actions of the trade union movement. I suppose,84
NA,that in a sense some of the matters we quoted in-,84
NA,vite that. But this shows exactly how the Govern-,84
NA,ment will go step by step until it has removed all,84
NA,sorts of protections from people.,84
NA,Mr Carlton-Don' t trivialise the argument.,84
NA,You know what I was talking about. It was,84
NA,limited.,84
Mr BRYANT,I t was not. As the honourable,84
NA,"member for Holt ( Mr Yates) put it, we should.at",84
NA,least be paid respect. We have been around for a,84
NA,long while and we have been through much of,84
NA,this activity. Do not let us fool ourselves. I have,84
NA,lived close enough to it. I have had brought to,84
NA,my notice in my time things which I regarded as,84
NA,very dangerous to the rights of individuals and,84
NA,their future. These things can flow only from the,84
NA,system that we have developed.,84
NA,Two aspects are involved. One is the law. The,84
NA,other is the collection of information. I expect,84
NA,that in general none of us is against the collection,84
NA,of information. We do not need to send out,84
NA,spooks to see what is happening in a trade union,84
NA,movement. We can telephone somebody after a,84
NA,meeting to ask who said what about which. On a,84
NA,number of occasions I have met people outside,84
NA,meetings and have said that they could either,84
NA,enter the meeting or be supplied with a list of,84
NA,those attending. We were not ashamed. But that,84
NA,is easy. If somebody driving a train goes on strike,84
NA,the facts are easy to determine. We are con-,84
NA,cerned about reports on individuals and infor-,84
NA,mation that ends up on dossiers and files which,84
NA,may be considered when people apply forjobs in,84
NA,the Commonwealth Public Service or are con-,84
NA,sidered for promotion somewhere in the system.,84
NA,A person's report may indicate that he once be-,84
NA,haved in a subversive fashion. I do not think it is,84
NA,possible to define the sort of things we are talking,84
NA,about in the way proposed. The Opposition is,84
NA,totally dissatisfied about the protection of the,84
NA,rights of individuals under this Bill.,84
NA,The legislation provides for the collection of,84
NA,with information and I am not sure that the Aus-,84
NA,tralian Security Intelligence Organisation is the,84
NA,best body to do that. There have been instances,84
NA,of people undergoing military training in forests,85
NA,somewhere. Apparently that has gone on for,85
NA,some time before being detected. We have only,85
NA,to look at what is happening in the rest of the,85
NA,world to see the difficulty of the problem. The,85
NA,point I am making is that it is easy to go beyond,85
NA,the limits of tolerance in these matters and to,85
NA,take action in respect of the activities of people,85
NA,with whom we disagree substantially on some,85
NA,political basis. A person may be involved in a,85
NA,major confrontation in the community. Ten years,85
NA,later after the confrontation has subsided his in-,85
NA,volvement is still noted on his dossier. That is,85
NA,element of danger. There is no way that this situ-,85
NA,ation can be corrected under this legislation.,85
NA,There must be a better way of meeting the,85
NA,situation.,85
Mr KERIN ,Werriwa) (8.23)-When the Op-,85
NA,position's amendment to this clause was being,85
NA,debated in the Senate the Attorney-General,85
NA,(Senator Durack) said that a clause of this kind,85
NA,must be interpreted in a commonsense,85
NA,not find that point of view altogether satisfactory.,85
NA,I do not think we should be attempting to place ganisations,85
NA,on the statute book laws that have to be,85
NA,interpreted in a commonsense way. Legal inASIO,85
NA,terpretation is bad enough. If one looks at this ations,85
NA,"clause in a commonsense way, one finds that control.",85
NA,sub-clause (1 )(a) refers to 'other unlawful acts'.,85
NA,Yet in relation to sub-clause (1) (b) the Governto,85
NA,ment is saying that we cannot insert the word states:,85
NA,'unlawful'. Looking at this clause in a common-,85
NA,"sense way, I do not know why it is all right to thus",85
NA,have that word in one paragraph and not have it case,85
NA,inserted in the other one.,85
NA,People are worried about two areas of this,85
NA,clause. They are worried in relation to the prob-,85
NA,"lems of picketing, of people exercising their right",85
NA,"of protest-fo r example, outside an office where",85
NA,people were being conscripted during the Viet-,85
NA,nam War. Under this legislation this is one action,85
NA,which could be interpreted as obstructing the,85
NA,"Defence Force. The other area of concern, as",85
NA,"other honourable members have pointed out, is",85
NA,"with respect to trade unions-fo r example, where",85
NA,the Transport Workers Union of Australia held,85
NA,up the supply of petrol or the operations of Gar-,85
NA,den Island Dockyard so that a ship could not be,85
NA,fitted out.,85
NA,There has been discussion,85
NA,the trade unions and about the use of the word,85
NA,'unlawful'. That is what we are,85
NA,The Australian Security Intelligence Organis-,85
NA,ation provided definitions of the meaning of,85
NA,'subversion' to the Royal Commission on Intelliway,85
NA,gence and Security. We all accept how difficult,85
NA,is to express the meaning of'subversion' and,85
NA,phrase it in a legal form. As the Deputy Leader,85
NA,"of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has said,",85
NA,we are talking about wording. But it is quite clear,85
NA,that ASIO did not want it described in terms as,85
NA,"broad as the definition in this Bill. For example,",85
NA,in the report of Mr Justice Hope the second,85
NA,definition of'subversion' is given as overthrow,85
NA,by force and undermining by unlawful means,85
NA,and the definition of'subversive activity' is given,85
NA,as overthrow of the Constitution by revolution or,85
NA,"sabotage, overthrow by force or violence and de-",85
NA,struction of Commonwealth property. The,85
NA,the definition is very definite and succinct. Because,85
NA,the Opposition simply wants to put in this clause,85
NA,the word 'unlawful'suddenly the Government is,85
NA,very worried. If one also looks at the section of,85
NA,Mr Justice Hope's report as to trade unions one,85
NA,will see that it states:,85
NA,"ASIO does not, and properly does not, surveil employer",85
NA,organisations or trade unions as such.,85
NA,Many people would disagree with that. The re-,85
NA,way. I do port continues:,85
NA,"However, the surveillance by ASIO of left-wing radical or-",85
NA,judged to be subversive or potentially subvers-,85
NA,"ive, and of the members of those organisations, has led to",85
NA,obtaining intelligence concerning the activities of trade,85
NA,unions which are controlled by members of those organis-,85
NA,or which the members of those organisations seek to,85
NA,"Relating this clause to defence, and specifically",85
NA,"defence contracts, paragraph 244 of the report",85
NA,"However, industrial disruption may affect security, and",85
NA,properly attract the attention of ASIO. This could be the,85
NA,inrespectof the disruption of undertakings carrying out,85
NA,"defence contracts, but it could be in other cases as well. If I",85
NA,"may illustrate this point by way of analogy, Australia has a",85
NA,'key points' system in its defence organisation. These 'key,85
NA,points' are places the destruction of or damage to which,85
NA,would affect Australia's defence and security.,85
NA,The paragraph goes on to say that these key,85
NA,points include defence installations and essential,85
NA,"features or services, such as water and power ser-",85
NA,vices. The upshot of the conclusion by Mr Justice,85
NA,Hope is that intelligence collected by ASIO could,85
NA,be referred to the Department of Industrial Re-,85
NA,lations. The report did not go much further than,85
NA,that. It states that it may be fair enough to collect,85
NA,intelligence on the activities of people within,85
NA,"trade unions, but I do not think that our amend-",85
NA,ment conflicts in any way with what Mr Justice,85
NA,about the actions of gence said,85
NA,Hope about the communication of intelli-,85
NA,about trade unions or with what ASIO said,85
NA,when it put up some definition of subversion to,85
NA,talking about. the Royal Commission.,85
Mr RUDDOCK ,Dundas) (8.28)-In a quiet,85
NA,I would like to add to this discussion. Both,85
NA,it sides of the chamber have cited examples. Some,85
NA,to clearly represent legal or lawful actions which,85
NA,honourable members on this side ofthe chamber,86
NA,"regard as being undesirable if they obstruct,",86
NA,hinder or interfere with the performance of the,86
NA,defence forces. Honourable members on the,86
NA,other side of the chamber have given examples,86
NA,of what might be described as lawful actions,86
NA,with which one would have no complaint. The,86
NA,nature of some of the examples given would not,86
NA,be harmful even to the extent that they may ob-,86
NA,"struct, hinder or interfere with the performance",86
NA,of the Defence Force in certain circumstances.,86
NA,Whilst we may be able to gather some examples,86
NA,of circumstances in which there would be a law-,86
NA,ful act which we would not regard as being unde-,86
NA,"sirable, the very fact that there are numbers of",86
NA,"lawful activities-o r as I put it earlier, permitted",86
NA,"activities, because they have not been made un-",86
NA,lawful by any specific statute-doe s not mean,86
NA,that it may not be very undesirable that such ac-,86
NA,"tivity which obstructs, hinders or interferes with",86
NA,the performance of the Defence Force in its func-,86
NA,tions is not to be brought under notice.,86
NA,Mr Barry Jones-Wil l that not make a com-,86
NA,mon law offence if it is not covered by statute?,86
Mr RUDDOCK,I do not know that there,86
NA,would be necessarily a common law offence.,86
NA,There may be a common law offence. If there is,86
NA,"then of course, in any event, the action would be",86
NA,encompassed by the inclusion of the word 'un-,86
NA,"lawful'. No, I am not suggesting that. I suggest if",86
NA,there were a suggestion in this place to make an,86
NA,activity illegal we would all in a bipartisan way,86
NA,want to make it illegal. But at this time in looking,86
NA,at an organisation and at the way in which it will,86
NA,and does function and at what it is required to,86
NA,do-bearin g in mind that it is merely an infor-,86
NA,mation gathering organisation-w e have to ask,86
NA,"ourselves whether it is reasonable, in terms of the",86
NA,"Opposition's approach, to fetter its investi-",86
NA,gations. I think that is what the Opposition wants,86
NA,to do.,86
NA,Mr Barry Jones-W e want to define-,86
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The Chair inter-,86
NA,rupts the conversation between the honourable,86
NA,member for Lalor and the honourable member,86
NA,for Dundas to remind the honourable member,86
NA,for Lalor that interjections are out of order and,86
NA,to remind the honourable member for Dundas to,86
NA,address the Committee through the Chair.,86
Mr RUDDOCK," Mr Chairman, in respect of",86
NA,police forces we do not fetter them by saying:,86
NA,'You shall investigate only what have already,86
NA,been established to be unlawful activities.' We,86
NA,say to them: 'You are entitled to undertake cer-,86
NA,tain investigations and when you have estab-,86
NA,lished that that conduct is unlawful you then,86
NA,bring the people before the courts to have them,86
NA,dealt with'. The police forces are given very wide,86
NA,powers of investigation. Certainly we circum-,86
NA,"scribe, as we have in this legislation, the circum-",86
NA,stances in which members of the police forces,86
NA,"may eavesdrop, tap telephones and so on. In",86
NA,"fact, we do not give the police, except by State",86
NA,"legislation, the power to tap telephones. The fact",86
NA,ofthe matter is that we circumscribed the nature,86
NA,of the investigations but we do not limit the,86
NA,extent to which police can investigate matters by,86
NA,requiring them to establish that the activity that,86
NA,they are investigating is unlawful. I think that is,86
NA,the point.,86
NA,Why should our intelligence organisation look,86
NA,at activities which in this clause relate to our de-,86
NA,fence forces carrying out their functions as de-,86
NA,fence forces for the purposes of the security and,86
NA,defence of the Commonwealth? We have to look,86
NA,"at sub-clause (1) (b), as we did in respect of the",86
NA,previous sub-clause. We have to look at all its el-,86
NA,ements because in addition to establishing that,86
NA,"the activities are directed to obstructing, hinder-",86
NA,ing or interfering with the performance of the de-,86
NA,"fence forces in carrying out their activities, it",86
NA,must also be established that the functions of the,86
NA,defence forces in that instance are for the pur-,86
NA,pose of security or the defence of the Common-,86
NA,wealth. This is not an exercise but it is something,86
NA,that is involved directly in the security and the,86
NA,defence of the Commonwealth. It is already cir-,86
NA,cumscribed and the Opposition is saying that in a,86
NA,time of war-becaus e that could be the,86
NA,circumstance-ther e might well be such activity.,86
NA,That is what I am looking at. It is not all of the,86
NA,activities in which people might be involved that,86
NA,"obstruct, hinder or interfere with the perform-",86
NA,ance of the Defence Force. There could be some,86
NA,activities which are permitted because no specific,86
NA,statute makes them illegal. Then everyone in a,86
NA,bipartisan way would acknowledge that they are,86
NA,of such a character that information ought to be,86
NA,collected about those who are involved in them.,86
NA,It is for that reason that I very strongly support,86
NA,this proposal of the Government. We reject the,86
NA,Opposition's amendment which seeks to add the,86
NA,word 'unlawful' in relation to qualifying the,86
NA,word 'activities'in clause 5( 1) (b).,86
Mr HOLDING ,Melbourne Ports) (8.35)- I,86
NA,think the difference between the honourable,86
NA,"member for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock), the Govern-",86
NA,ment and the Opposition on this matter really,86
NA,comes back to an approach to the,86
NA,responsibilities-a s supporters of the government,86
NA,see them-an d the role of the security forces and,86
NA,our approach in balancing that role with the,86
NA,rights and liberties of Australian citizens. Again I,86
NA,repeat the point which does not seem to have,87
NA,formed any impression on the mind of the,87
NA,honourable member for Dundas. It is one of the,87
NA,functions of our intelligence and security forces,87
NA,to protect and enhance the rights and liberties of,87
NA,the Australian people. If we as a parliament and,87
NA,"as legislators are to make a judgment, we must",87
NA,be conscious all the time of balancing those two,87
NA,factors. Again I make the point that I made,87
NA,earlier about this very clause. When we are deal-,87
NA,ing with the definition of subversion it is import-,87
NA,ant not to cast the net so widely that we continu-,87
NA,ally impose upon the Director-General the,87
NA,obligation to involve himself in surveillance,87
NA,activities and in activities related to subversion,87
NA,which is a very serious allegation.,87
NA,This legislation is asking the Director-General,87
NA,to continually involve himself in areas which in,87
NA,fact do not really go to the defence of the realm,87
NA,or to problems related to the role of our armed,87
NA,services. The difference between the honourable,87
NA,"member for Dundas, the Minister for Employ-",87
NA,ment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) and,87
NA,members of the Opposition is simply this: We say,87
NA,that when it comes to balancing those two issues,87
NA,the presumption always has to be and should be,87
NA,"on defending the rights of the citizen, not on im-",87
NA,posing additional and complex responsibilities,87
NA,on the Director-General.,87
NA,Let me look at the width of that definition. The,87
NA,"fact of the matter is, as the honourable member",87
NA,"for Dundas well knows, that the attitude of",87
NA,courts to the defence powers has always,87
NA,one of wide interpretation. Whenever there has,87
NA,been a tendency to extend the power of the Comwaterside,87
NA,monwealth over the States or anyone else there,87
NA,has always been the tendency to look at the,87
NA,fence powers and at the traditional breadth,87
NA,decision that the courts have always taken.,87
NA,Mr Ruddock-I n times of war?,87
Mr HOLDING,Not just in times of war. Let,87
NA,me look at the operations of the Department,87
NA,Defence in relation to its handling of information,87
NA,for this Parliament and this Government. I refer,87
NA,to the speech that was recently made by Senator,87
NA,Hamer in another place. He made a very to,87
NA,scathing indictment on the operations of that,87
NA,partment. The Department takes the view that,87
NA,almost everything it does can be defended,87
NA,can be done in secrecy. Its attitude,87
NA,Parliament is that because it is a defence matter,87
NA,none of us have any rights at all. So when we are,87
NA,talking about the defence powers we are talking lung.,87
NA,about a tradition of judicial interpretation and,87
NA,about an attitude within the bureaucracy,87
NA,towards what constitutes the defence of the,87
NA,realm. We on this side of the Committee do not,87
NA,say that people ought to be able to deliberately,87
NA,obstruct and destroy the role of the armed ser-,87
NA,vices. What we are saying is that if that is what it,87
NA,"is all about, then that of its very nature is an il -",87
NA,legal activity. The Minister for Employment and,87
NA,Youth Affairs shakes his head.,87
Mr VINER ,I t may not be.,87
Mr HOLDING,Let me say this to the Minis-,87
NA,ter: I find the situation extraordinary. On one,87
NA,view of the matter within the framework of this,87
NA,interpretation one could say that if Senator,87
NA,Hamer had made his statements in a public place,87
NA,or if he had repeated the same speech within the,87
NA,councils of the Liberal Party at its State confer-,87
NA,ence it would be open to argument-an d is cer-,87
NA,tainly not an argument that could be lightly,87
NA,rejected-tha t that was an activity which inter-,87
NA,fered with and hindered the performance or,87
NA,functions of the defence forces.,87
Mr VINER ,"Yo u are a lawyer, are you not?",87
Mr HOLDING, I was always paid better and,87
NA,had better briefs than the Minister and for good,87
NA,reason.,87
Mr VINER ,Yo u leave a word out of the clause,87
NA,all the time.,87
Mr HOLDING, I will be happy to join issue,87
NA,with the Minister at any time he likes.,87
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,87
NA,the member for Melbourne Ports will address him-,87
NA,been self to the question before the House.,87
Mr HOLDING," A group of railway workers,",87
NA,workers or any other group of workers,87
NA,can involve themselves legitimately in a strike for,87
NA,dea direct industrial purpose. They might want an,87
NA,of extra $5 a week or extra long service leave.,87
NA,Mr Cotter-The y can go to arbitration.,87
Mr HOLDING,Th e difference between a,87
NA,parliamentarian and the average worker is that,87
NA,of workers do not have the kinds of tribunals by,87
NA,which parliamentarians get their wage increases.,87
NA,"Often, unlike honourable gentlemen opposite,",87
NA,they have to indulge in industrial action in order,87
NA,keep up with the cost of living. They do not,87
NA,Dehave wage increases handed out to them on a,87
NA,platter. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie,87
NA,and was paid on the basis of his performance he,87
NA,towards the would be on the dole.,87
NA,Mr Cotter-Yo u would not work in an iron,87
Mr HOLDING,Th e honourable member,87
NA,never has. He would know all about not working,87
NA,in an iron lung. He would never want payments,87
NA,on the basis of capacity of performance and cer-,88
NA,tainly not on the basis of productivity in this,88
NA,place. It is extraordinary how honourable,88
NA,gentlemen opposite get upset and concerned,88
NA,about people going on strike. When tiiis Govern-,88
NA,ment's representatives go to International Labor,88
NA,Organisation conventions they recognise the,88
NA,right to strike. Any group of workers may be legi- activities,88
NA,timately involved in strike activity although we,88
NA,may not agree with the purpose of the strike.,88
NA,Such a strike might be an incident that would,88
NA,hinder the performance of the armed Services. In,88
NA,that situation would we say that those people,88
NA,were guilty of subversion?,88
NA,"Mr Ruddock-Yes , in that situation; if troops",88
NA,couldn't get to the front because someone was,88
NA,out on strike.,88
Mr HOLDING,Th e honourable member for,88
NA,Dundas says yes. That is the difference between,88
NA,Government supporters and members of the Opexample.,88
NA,position. The honourable member for Dundas,88
NA,perfectly happy to give these very wide powers,88
NA,an intelligence and security operation. I take,88
NA,from his own interjection that he is perfectly,88
NA,happy with that provision. He wants the powers ties.,88
NA,given to the Organisation to be so wide that they,88
NA,can encompass legitimate industrial activity.,88
NA,Mr Ruddock-On e that stopped the troops,88
NA,getting to the front in time of war.,88
The CHAIRMAN,Order! I warn the honourment,88
NA,able member for Dundas.,88
Mr HOLDING,Th e honourable member for outside,88
NA,Dundas by his own interjection has disclosed,88
NA,both his purpose and his concept. That is why,88
NA,are opposed to the length and breadth of this,88
NA,clause. I do not think that the Director-General,88
NA,of Security ought to have imposed on him the,88
NA,power to act in all those situations which arise,88
NA,the community and which can have incidental,88
NA,effects on the defence forces. Nobody on the,88
NA,Government side believes-th e Minister for,88
NA,NA,88
NA,believe-tha t we are likely to be at war,88
NA,five years. If the honourable member for Dundas Opposition.,88
NA,believes that we will be at war in the next five,88
NA,years let him tell us. That is not the view of his,88
NA,Government.,88
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable ties.,88
NA,member's time has expired.,88
Mr VINER ,Stirling-Minister for Employnotorious,88
NA,ment and Youth Affairs) (8.46)-Th e GovernLord,88
NA,ment cannot accept this amendment by the Opby,88
NA,position. I will make a number of short points,88
NA,against what has been said. The first is that,88
NA,"their Opposition members in all their arguments,",88
NA,which have been epitomised by the previous,88
NA,"speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne",88
NA,"Ports ( Mr Holding), have omitted one word",88
NA,when they discussed this sub-clause. That word,88
NA,controls the whole of the clause itself. It is the,88
NA,word 'directed'. In relation to the meaning of-,88
NA,"subversion, clause 5 (1) (b) states:",88
NA,"directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering",88
NA,with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions,88
NA,or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Common-,88
NA,wealth for the purposes of security or the defence of the,88
NA,Commonwealth;,88
NA,"Therefore, the act which is kept under surveil-",88
NA,lance must be an act which is judged to be,88
NA,"directed to this purpose-t o obstruct, hinder or",88
NA,interfere with the performance of the Defence,88
NA,"Force. It is an old debating technique, well",88
NA,recognised by anybody who has been involved in,88
NA,"debating in the past, that in order to condemn",88
NA,something a person always uses an innocent,88
NA,He says: 'There is an innocent activity.,88
NA,is Why should that activity be rendered unlawful,88
NA,to or kept under surveillance by the security organ-,88
NA,it isation? When an innocent activity is kept under,88
NA,surveillance that is an infringement of civil liber-,88
NA,' It is not the innocent activity to which this,88
NA,clause is directed but to some other kind of ac-,88
NA,tivity. This point illustrates the fallacy of the ar-,88
NA,"guments of the Opposition. For example, it says",88
NA,that a march or demonstration in the street to,88
NA,protest against a law or executive act of govern-,88
NA,could be the subject of surveillance under,88
NA,clause 5 (1) (b). Another example given was a,88
NA,"speech by Senator Hamer, not in the House but",88
NA,"it, when he criticised the administrative",88
NA,competence of the Department of Defence. Of,88
NA,"we course, those activities are not caught by this",88
NA,"clause, nor are they intended to be. They are",88
NA,"innocent activities, known to everyone, which are",88
NA,"not directed to obstructing, hindering, or inter-",88
NA,in fering with the performance by the Defence,88
NA,Force of its functions. We need to recognise this,88
NA,debating technique. I am sure that as it has come,88
NA,out in the debate on this amendment so we will,88
NA,find the same technique used throughout the de-,88
NA,within bate on the amendments proposed by the,88
NA,It has been said that the only activities which,88
NA,ought to be capable of surveillance under the,88
NA,authority of this legislation are unlawful activi-,88
NA,I will give an example which I think will be,88
NA,understood by everyone. One of the most recent,88
NA,acts of terrorism was the bombing of,88
NA,Mountbatten's boat. The bomb was set off,88
NA,remote control. It killed Lord Mountbatten,88
NA,"and other people. That was an unlawful action, it",88
NA,all was murder. Let us transpose that action to a,88
NA,situation in Australia. I was in the executive,88
NA,building of the Government of New South,89
NA,Wales in Sydney last Friday at a conference of,89
NA,State and Commonwealth Labour Ministers.,89
NA,The room overlooked Garden Island Dockyard,89
NA,where HMAS Melbourne was moored. If some-,89
NA,one who wished to obstruct the performance by,89
NA,the Defence Force of its functions put a bomb,89
NA,against the hull of HMAS Melbourne and by re-,89
NA,"mote control triggered that bomb and blew it up,",89
NA,the act of blowing it up would be unlawful. The,89
NA,Opposition is suggesting that the Australian Se-,89
NA,curity Intelligence Organisation could not keep,89
NA,that person under surveillance prior to his,89
NA,placing the bomb and triggering it off with the,89
NA,purpose of obstructing the performance by the,89
NA,Defence Force of its functions.,89
NA,I think that shows the absurdity of the,89
NA,osition of the Opposition. ASIO would need to,89
NA,know that an unlawful act was being committed,89
NA,before it could even keep the activity of that,89
NA,group of people under surveillance. Quite obviMackellar,89
NA,ously ASIO has to have the authority to keep,89
NA,"under surveillance activities, lawful or unlawful,",89
NA,"which are directed to obstructing, hindering",89
NA,interfering with the performance by the Defence,89
NA,Force of its functions. Let us not detract from the,89
NA,application of common sense in this situation.,89
NA,The intelligence authorities must be able to,89
NA,a judgment of the character and nature of,89
NA,activities of people. I think it is quite clear,89
NA,that if one limits ASIO's surveillance capacity,89
NA,"activities which are unlawful in themselves, then",89
NA,"one seriously circumscribes, inhibits and limits",89
NA,capacity to act in the interests of the nation.,89
NA,It is quite clear then that the security authoribourne,89
NA,ties must have the capacity to keep under surveillife.,89
NA,"lance activities, either lawful or unlawful,",89
NA,directed to the matters stated in the clause.,89
NA,peat those again. They are activities 'directed,89
NA,"obstructing, hindering or interfering with the",89
NA,performance by the Defence Force of its functies,89
NA,tions or the carrying out of other activities by or,89
NA,for the Commonwealth for the purposes of securtion.,89
NA,ity or the defence of the Commonwealth.,89
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith) ution,89
NA,(8.52)- I have never heard a more outrageous,89
NA,suggestion than the one just made. In the calmsome,89
NA,ness of debate the Opposition gave instances,89
NA,how it thought innocent people could be the,89
NA,ject of surveillance. We led off in that area. Ever,89
NA,since then we have had nothing but examples of,89
NA,actual criminal acts. The honourable member for,89
NA,Mackellar ( Mr Carlton) is anxious that there be,89
NA,some sort of judicial control because of some,89
NA,olution that the trade unions should not be,89
NA,ject to judicial proceedings. But this provision,89
NA,does not relate to control. This is a definition,89
NA,subversion. When a person comes under notice a,89
NA,file is created. The clause does not do anything,89
NA,other than that. It will not save HMAS Mel-,89
NA,"bourne from disaster, if that is the stupid illus-",89
NA,tration now offered. The instance cited would be,89
NA,a criminal act. That has nothing to do with this,89
NA,legislation. This clause is not about enforcing the,89
NA,criminal law. If there is a crime the Government,89
NA,knows it will be dealt with. The point we are,89
NA,making is this: When are people brought under,89
NA,notice?,89
NA,Let me refer to what was said. According to,89
NA,"Mr Justice Hope, the trade unions are perform-",89
NA,"ing very creditably indeed, thank you very much.",89
NA,"He made the point that ASIO does not, and",89
NA,"properly does not, survey employer organis-",89
NA,propations or trade unions as such. He said that,89
NA,activities do not affect security merely because,89
NA,"they may cause, or do result in, industrial disrup-",89
NA,tion. I point out to the honourable member for,89
NA,that if there is something wrong in a,89
NA,trade union it will be revealed at a meeting.,89
NA,Trade unions usually have meetings. The,89
NA,or honourable member would be aware of what,89
NA,was happening. The trade unions can be subject,89
NA,to discipline in the courts. They can be subject to,89
NA,penalties and their members can lose wages.,89
NA,make There are no clandestine operations at trade,89
NA,the union meetings. There would be more clan-,89
NA,then destine operations at a Liberal Party branch,89
NA,"to meeting, but nobody wants to interfere with",89
NA,those functions. The question we are about here,89
NA,its is this: When do you create a file on a person?,89
NA,This has got nothing to do with HMAS Mel-,89
NA,being blown up or anyone losing their,89
NA,Such happenings would be criminal acts. A,89
NA,person caught in that act would be dealt with.,89
NA,I reWe are talking about a definition of activities,89
NA,to that bring a person under notice for subversion.,89
NA,The Minister makes the point that the activi-,89
NA,have to be directed at something. There has,89
NA,to be an overt act if one is going to find the direc-,89
NA,Does the Government seriously suggest that,89
NA,because a trade union meeting passes a resol-,89
NA,that it is not going to work a certain ship,89
NA,that therefore is an action directed at causing,89
NA,subversion? The ship may not sail and the,89
NA,"of people involved in the strike can be penalised,",89
NA,subbut there is no subversion. Is the Government,89
NA,seriously suggesting that a file has to be started,89
NA,on everyone involved in that strike because for,89
NA,thefirsttimethey have come under the eye of se-,89
NA,curity? It is just unfortunate that that particular,89
NA,resship was loading ammunition among other,89
NA,substores. But had this happened the next week,89
NA,when a ship was loading wheat it would not have,89
NA,of had any significance at all. When we talk about,89
NA,activities there has got to be some assessment.,90
NA,The activity is not going to be subject to any,90
NA,court or judicial proceeding. This is the point. It,90
NA,comes down to a file being prepared on a person,90
NA,and he then comes under surveillance. People,90
NA,can have their telephones tapped and all these,90
NA,other things can happen.,90
Mr VINER ,Unde r warrant.,90
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,By the Director-,90
NA,General attimesin an emergency.,90
Mr VINER ,Unde r warrant.,90
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,"Under warrants,",90
NA,which you will not disclose to the Opposition. Let,90
NA,us make the position very clear. The Minister,90
NA,thinks there is a lot of comfort in having a war-,90
NA,rant. Anyone who has had something to do with,90
NA,the Postmaster-General- I happened to be one-,90
NA,knows that attimestelephones are tapped with-,90
NA,out warrants. The person who has the capacity to,90
NA,tap a telephone often does not have the incli-,90
NA,nation to get a warrant. Let me be clear about,90
NA,that.,90
Mr VINER ,Don' t cast the sins of others on,90
NA,ASIO.,90
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,You would know,90
NA,what happens. You are in government. Check it,90
NA,out Your Minister is not prepared to disclose to,90
NA,the Parliament the number of warrants that are,90
NA,issued. He thinks this has something to do with,90
NA,helping the KGB. We cannot even find the infor-,90
NA,mation. Let us get back to what we are about in,90
NA,the definition-,90
Mr VINER ,I t is about time.,90
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,It is abouttime.The,90
NA,"Minister is the most frequent interjector and, I",90
NA,"may say, the greatest union basher we have on a",90
NA,clause dealing with subversion. Government,90
NA,members have spent all their time on this matter,90
NA,belting the unions. Union members are the one,90
NA,group of people who meet in the open to pass a,90
NA,"resolution, God help us if that cannot happen;",90
NA,we are in trouble! But what are we to do about,90
NA,an innocent person who says: ' I do not think we,90
NA,should be recruiting people into the Navy.'? That,90
NA,is not an unlawful act but that person can come,90
NA,"under notice because, according to the Minister's",90
NA,"own classification, he is directing his remarks to",90
NA,hindering the Defence forces. Let us look at this,90
NA,matter properly. We are using it for that purpose.,90
NA,It was the example we gave but nobody got up to,90
NA,deny it. Yet we hear all sorts of irrelevant matters,90
NA,about what happened at the Adelaide confer-,90
NA,ence or how some people who never served in a,90
NA,theatre of war are worried about the future of a,90
NA,war. Bear in mind that most unionists fought in,90
NA,the two World Wars. Most of those who lost their,90
NA,"lives in violent action were unionists, yet the",90
NA,Government has this dreadfulfixation-I will not,90
NA,use the word paranoic-wha t is wrong with,90
NA,unions.,90
NA,Mr Carlton-Nothing .,90
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,That is right. The,90
NA,reason why there is so much difficulty with this,90
NA,legislation is that the Government will not allow,90
NA,calm discussion. Every person on the Govern-,90
NA,ment side now-ther e are not too many-ha s,90
NA,some peculiar idea of how to run this legislation.,90
NA,We may as well give the whole credit for the,90
NA,Government's case to the honourable member,90
NA,for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock). He has not missed,90
NA,one opportunity to speak. He has continually,90
NA,attacked the trade union movement and referred,90
NA,to what is wrong with his fellow Australians. Yet,90
NA,in this atmosphere we are trying to get bipartisan,90
NA,agreement on the words in this Bill. People are,90
NA,genuinely concerned. When we see legislation,90
NA,like this we think that it has been drafted by,90
NA,"somebody who may need guidance, someone",90
NA,who has never had the benefit of listening to a,90
NA,debate. It was drafted by somebody who hap-,90
NA,pens to be a parliamentary counsel. This is not,90
NA,Mr Justice Hope's legislation. It happens to have,90
NA,been drafted by somebody who feels that this is,90
NA,the way in which to control subversion.,90
NA,All the other examples are examples of acts of,90
NA,violence. They are criminal acts and they will be,90
NA,dealt with on that basis. But who are the innocent,90
NA,people who will be brought under notice and,90
NA,"never know about it, who will never have the op-",90
NA,portunity to know that a file has been prepared,90
NA,on them because they happened to take particu-,90
NA,lar action on the waterfront in Sydney and some,90
NA,question arose about hindering the Defence,90
NA,Force? Let me make the position very clear. The,90
NA,Defence Force has its own ideas on how to look,90
NA,after itself in these matters. The Hope report,90
NA,shows clearly that if there is proper intelligence,90
NA,the Defence Force will be well aware of the,90
NA,people who have the motivation and deliberate,90
NA,intent to hinder it. Let us not put ourselves in the,90
NA,stupid situation in which the passing of a resol-,90
NA,ution by a particular union that its members will,90
NA,not load a ship is regarded as an overt act,90
NA,directed at hindering the Defence Force. Such,90
NA,action might have only to do with trying to get,90
NA,"another $ 10 a week, depending on what particu-",90
NA,lar vessel is concerned. I just want to bring some,90
NA,bipartisanship back into this matter. We have,90
NA,spoken about innocent people who can be caught,90
NA,up in the definition of subversion and have a file,90
NA,prepared on them on that basis. It is for that,90
NA,reason that we have said that we should look at,90
NA,the real motive for the activities in question and,91
NA,that any activity that is deemed to be subversive,91
NA,needs to be unlawful.,91
Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (9.1 ) - I want to make,91
NA,"it clear right from the outset that, as far as I am",91
NA,"concerned, any person who wilfully sought to in-",91
NA,terfere with the activities of the Defence Force in,91
NA,a manner which would in any way inhibit its,91
NA,ability to defend this country or endanger-,91
Mr VINER ,"Obstruct , hinder or interfere.",91
Mr SCHOLES,I said: 'In any way inhibit its,91
NA,ability to defend this country'. I know that the,91
NA,Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs is a,91
NA,player on words but I want to give him a bit of a,91
NA,"serve on his incompetence in law, so he should",91
NA,stop interjecting. Anyone who in any way,91
NA,inhibits-tha t means in any way interferes with-,91
NA,the ability of the Defence Force-,91
Mr VINER ,"Oh , no!",91
Mr SCHOLES,I am glad that the Minister,91
NA,understands the English language. Anyone who,91
NA,in any way inhibits the ability of the Defence,91
NA,Force in its carrying out of its functions in respect,91
NA,of the security of Australia or Australia's defence,91
NA,is a person who should and would be dealt with.,91
NA,"That, I hope, is not in question. The example",91
NA,given by the Minister is possibly the most incom-,91
NA,petent example I have ever heard given in a par-,91
NA,liament. Any person who planned-th e Minister,91
NA,said that the security forces would not be able to,91
NA,conduct surveillance on a person while he was,91
NA,planning-a n action such as he described would,91
NA,be acting in breach of Commonwealth law. The,91
NA,"Commonwealth Crimes Act, which I am sure he",91
NA,"understands, was significantly amended as far",91
NA,back as 1961 to make it an illegal act to approach,91
NA,a defence establishment. There is an Act which,91
NA,"covers Garden Island, called the Control of",91
NA,"Naval Waters Act, which some members of the",91
NA,"Parliament might have heard about, and which",91
NA,would make it illegal for an unauthorised person,91
NA,to enter that area. The preparation and planting,91
NA,of any device for the purpose of sabotage would,91
NA,"contravene the Crimes Act, certainly the defence",91
NA,"Acts, and the Control of Naval Waters Act.",91
NA,To say that such a person was not guilty of,91
NA,subversion because the clause requires an illegal,91
NA,act to have been committed is to say something,91
NA,which can only be classified as incompetent and,91
NA,misleading. Such a person would have carried,91
NA,out any numberof illegal acts which would qual-,91
NA,ify for surveillance under this clause long before,91
NA,he even got a bomb together. I think it is worth,91
NA,saying to the Committee that the record of our,91
NA,intelligence organisations in relation to bomb-,91
NA,ings is not very good. So far they have not been,91
NA,able to advise a government of the likelihood of,91
NA,a politically motivated bombing and so far there,91
NA,is no history of anyone who carried out such an,91
NA,act being discovered. I think we ought to be try-,91
NA,ing in this case to ensure that this legislation will,91
NA,in fact carry out the functions of enhancing secur-,91
NA,ity and of ensuring that the security organisations,91
NA,in Australia are able to carry out their functions,91
NA,and that the people of Australia will have con-,91
NA,fidence that they are carrying out those functions,91
NA,in a manner which the people of a democratic so-,91
NA,ciety are entitled to expect.,91
NA,I repeat what I said earlier in the day: The es-,91
NA,tablishment of a security file on a person places a,91
NA,very serious limitation on that person's civil,91
NA,rights in this country. It denies that person access,91
NA,to any number of areas of activity. The ability to,91
NA,establish a security file on a matter which is,91
NA,deemed to be subversive but which is not illegal,91
NA,would seem to be an extension of the inroads into,91
NA,the legal rights of citizens which should not be,91
NA,tolerated in a democratic society. I know that the,91
NA,Minister just does not understand the difficulties,91
NA,of people who are caught up in this type of situ-,91
NA,"ation. He does not understand people at all,",91
NA,judging by what he says in this House. He cer-,91
NA,tainly has no respect for the law as a protector of,91
NA,the rights of a citizen but he looks on it as a ve-,91
NA,hicle to inhibit the rights of a citizen. There are,91
NA,adequate provisions for security forces to insti-,91
NA,tute surveillance in any situation in which a per-,91
NA,son is a security risk or takes part in activities,91
NA,which would bring him under notice as a poss-,91
NA,ible security risk. This clause as drafted is little,91
NA,more than a pretext. No protection is provided,91
NA,anywhere in the legislation for a person who is,91
NA,improperly placed under surveillance and,91
NA,against whom a file is improperly established.,91
NA,"There is no means of audit, no means of notifica-",91
NA,tion and no means by which even the Minister,91
NA,can be informed of the establishment of such,91
NA,files.,91
The CHAIRMAN, I think the honourable,91
NA,member is getting a little away from the,91
NA,question.,91
Mr SCHOLES," Mr Chairman, we should",91
NA,keep in mind the very wide net of laws which,91
NA,"protect our security organisations, our defence",91
NA,forces and those other activities which have to do,91
NA,with the security and defence of Australia. There,91
NA,"is a myriad of Acts, not the least of which is the",91
NA,"Commonwealth Crimes Act, which contains",91
NA,clauses of this type and which would deem a very,91
NA,minor breach of the types described here to be an,91
NA,illegal action. Given that no protection exists in,91
NA,"the legislation for a person, given that a person",91
NA,"has no defence, I think it is not unreasonable for",91
NA,this clause to contain a provision that before an,92
NA,"activity is deemed to be an act of subversion, be-",92
NA,fore the step of restricting his future civil liberties,92
NA,in this country is taken-i t is a severe restriction,92
NA,to establish a file on a person-tha t person should,92
NA,at least have been charged with or deemed to,92
NA,have undertaken an illegal act.,92
Mr HOLDING ,Melbourne Ports) (9.8)- I,92
NA,was worried about this legislation when I first,92
NA,"looked at it, but having heard the explanation of",92
NA,the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs,92
NA,"( Mr Viner), I am now terrified. First of all, in the",92
NA,course ofhis tortuous legal argument he said that,92
NA,members of the Opposition had omitted to apply,92
NA,their minds to the word 'directed' as it appears in,92
NA,the clause. If by implication the Minister is refer-,92
NA,ring to activities which are primarily directed to,92
NA,"obstructing and hindering, I would agree with",92
NA,him. But if that is what the honourable gentle-,92
NA,"man meant, that is what should have been said in",92
NA,the Bill.,92
NA,The fact is that by implication the thrust of the,92
NA,"Minister's argument is that an activity, in order",92
NA,"to fall within the definition of subversion, has to",92
NA,be primarily directed to obstructing or inter-,92
NA,fering with the performance of the Defence,92
NA,Force. That is not what the clause says. The,92
NA,clause refers to 'activities directed'. That is a,92
NA,broad definition. An action does not have to be,92
NA,primarily directed and there does not have to be,92
NA,a prior intention. An industrial stoppage or any,92
NA,one of a number of ordinary exercises in the daily,92
NA,life of a citizen which has the effect of being,92
NA,directed falls within the provisions of the clause.,92
NA,If what the Minister is talking about is where it is,92
NA,"primarily directed, then the legislation ought to",92
NA,say that. That is the real thrust of the Minister's,92
NA,"argument but that, of course, is not what the",92
NA,clause states. What really terrified me was his,92
NA,own analogy. I invite the House to contemplate,92
NA,that.,92
NA,What this Minister wants the House and the,92
NA,people of Australia to believe-i t is the most,92
NA,extraordinary argument I have ever heard from,92
NA,lawyer-i s that some terrorist whom we shall call,92
NA,"Boris, could make himself a bomb. He could",92
NA,"manufacture it in his house, wander through the",92
NA,streets of Sydney with it in his Gladstone bag,92
NA,go down to the wharf while the Minister is innoBoris,92
NA,cently going about his business. The Minister,92
NA,looks up and he sees Boris who presumably puts,92
NA,on his snorkel and his flippers and dives,92
NA,and plants that bomb on the side of HMAS anything,92
NA,Melbourne. What then occurs? Boris goes off the,92
NA,"wharf, takes out his little remote control button",92
NA,and it is not until he presses that button that,92
NA,Australia Security Intelligence Organisation can,92
NA,move in and ask: 'What are you doing?'Accord-,92
NA,ing to the Minister until Boris actually puts his,92
NA,finger on the button there is no illegal activity. It,92
NA,is all perfectly lawful. That example comes from,92
NA,"a Minister of the Crown, a trained lawyer, who is",92
NA,handling this Bill in the Parliament. I do not,92
NA,want to give the Minister too many lessons in,92
NA,legal interpretation but let us go back to Boris,92
NA,manufacturing bis bomb in his little house in the,92
NA,electorate of the honourable member for Dundas,92
NA,( Mr Ruddock). Are honourable members op-,92
NA,posite trying to say that if an ordinary police con-,92
NA,stable wandered into Boris's home because he,92
NA,believed Boris was involved in a starting price,92
NA,betting operation and found Boris with a bomb,92
NA,he would say: ' I only came about the SP betting,92
NA,"operation. My word, you have a bomb there with",92
NA,"you, have you, Boris? That is not an illegal ac-",92
NA,tivity. I will be back about the SP betting oper-,92
NA,ation'. He then goes off into the night. Boris then,92
NA,walks through the streets of Sydney with his,92
NA,bomb in his Gladstone bag. He might even go up,92
NA,to a policeman and ask: 'Could you tell me,92
NA,where I can find Cockatoo Dock?' The police-,92
NA,"man says: 'My, Boris, what have you got in your",92
NA,bag?' Boris replies: ' I have got a bomb'. The,92
NA,police constable says: 'You have not committed,92
NA,any breach of the law. Cockatoo Dock is that,92
NA,"way. Don't do anything silly, will you, Boris'.",92
NA,Mr Cotter-Wh o is being silly now?,92
Mr HOLDING,That is the argument put by,92
NA,the Minister. As a result of the friendly instruc-,92
NA,tion by the friendly New South Wales constable,92
NA,Boris finds his way. He walks onto the wharf.,92
NA,Anybody who has ever walked onto a wharf,92
NA,"knows that there is"" always a pile of regulations",92
NA,that cannot be jumped over. There are many by-,92
NA,laws governing what occurs there. But Boris,92
NA,walks on with his bomb. This place always has,92
NA,policemen on duty. A policeman asks Boris:,92
NA,'What are you doing Boris?' Boris replies: ' I have,92
NA,got a bomb here'. The policeman says: 'That is,92
NA,"a not illegal because we listened to Mr Viner, you",92
NA,know that very learned lawyer who is charge of,92
NA,the ASIO Bill on behalf ofthe Government. We,92
NA,will ring up ASIO and if you actually press the,92
NA,and button you will be in trouble. But see you later,92
NA,because there is nothing we can do'. So the,92
NA,policeman watches Boris put on his flippers and,92
NA,his snorkel and plant the bomb on the side of,92
NA,down HMAS Melbourne. Even then he does not do,92
NA,because of what this Minister who is in,92
NA,"charge of this legislation and, God help us, in",92
NA,"charge of our liberties, has said. We are dealing",92
NA,the with the crime of subversion. This Minister says,92
NA,that until Boris presses the button no crime has,92
NA,"been committed. Well, let me just say to the Min-",93
NA,"ister, more in pity than in anger, that the act of",93
NA,manufacturing a bomb in any residence any-,93
NA,where in Sydney or in Melbourne or anywhere at,93
NA,all-,93
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-Yo u sound like Ginger,93
NA,Meggs.,93
Mr HOLDING, I might sound like him but,93
NA,the honourable member looks like him so that,93
NA,makes us equal. The act of manufacturing a,93
NA,bomb anywhere is an illegal act and I do not,93
NA,have to tell that to the Parliament. I ask any,93
NA,honourable member to go outside and ask any,93
NA,police constable who does not draw half the sal-,93
NA,ary of the Minister whether walking around a,93
NA,public place with a bomb is an unlawful activity.,93
NA,Do not ask the Minister but ask any average,93
NA,police constable about walking onto a wharf,93
NA,with a bomb.,93
Mr SCHOLES ,Approachin g a defence estab-,93
NA,lishment is an offence.,93
Mr HOLDING,"Indeed , even being there",93
NA,without lawful authority is an offence. I would,93
NA,say that by the time poor Boris even got his ex-,93
NA,plosive substances together-befor e he actually,93
NA,reached the wharf-h e would have committed a,93
NA,number of breaches of State laws and local coun-,93
NA,cil by-laws. There would be so many unlawful,93
NA,activities in which he would have been involved,93
NA,that any security intelligence operation that did,93
NA,not have that situation covered would be grossly,93
NA,derelict in its duty. The enormity of it is,93
NA,Minister who is in charge of this legislation has,93
NA,the gall when he invents a hypothetical situation,93
NA,to justify the far-reaching provisions of this Bill,93
NA,to produce an example which is not only demon-,93
NA,strably and palpably legal nonsense but also it is,93
NA,grossly misleading the Parliament and the,93
NA,people of Australia. Why would he do it? He is,93
NA,not altogether a legal fool. Why would he want,93
NA,to invent and produce an example that is so de-,93
NA,monstrably an palpably false? It is because he,93
NA,knows that he cannot justify the situation.,93
NA,Mr Ruddock-Perhap s it is to help you.,93
Mr HOLDING,Th e honourable member for,93
NA,Dundas is a lawyer. I invite him to get up and tell,93
NA,me whether he believes it is possible to manufac-,93
NA,"ture a bomb, wander around his electorate, get",93
NA,down to Cockatoo Dock and plant it on the side,93
NA,of the Melbourne without breaching-neve r mind,93
NA,Commonwealth laws-an y of the local State,93
NA,laws. If the honourable member believes that I,93
NA,invite him to get up and tell me. I will listen very,93
NA,patiently because I suspect that the honourable,93
NA,member for Dundas as a lawyer does not want to,93
NA,get into this argument. He will leave the Minister,93
NA,with his own deplorable example. The point I am,93
NA,"making is this: Why, with all the examples that",93
NA,"are available, would the Minister choose such a",93
NA,bad one. He chooses such a bad one because he is,93
NA,desperate. Acknowledging the arguments which,93
NA,he cannot meet and which have been put for-,93
NA,ward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,93
NA,( Mr Lionel Bowen) and acknowledging the in-,93
NA,trinsic logic of the arguments that have been put,93
NA,forward the Minister is unable to answer them.,93
NA,He resorts to the mythical terrorist who is going,93
NA,to destroy the HMAS Melbourne. Everyone,93
NA,knows that HMAS Melbourne is the most lethal,93
NA,weapon in the Australian Navy. Every time it,93
NA,puts to sea it sinks something. He produces this,93
NA,imaginary terrorist and creates a palpably false,93
NA,situation. He puts a position to this House which,93
NA,is a palpable legal absurdity. As I said at the be-,93
NA,"ginning, this clause is bad enough, but when I",93
NA,"hear these sorts of arguments, I am terrified that",93
NA,anyone ought to have these sorts of powers be-,93
NA,cause what we are dealing with are the rights and,93
NA,liberties of the ordinary Australian citizen and,93
NA,what this clause is dealing with is the crime of,93
NA,subversion.,93
Dr EVERINGHAM ,Capricornia) (9.18)- I,93
NA,would just like to relate a little of my experiences,93
NA,with the Australian Security Intelligence Organ-,93
NA,isation to indicate that the Opposition is not talk-,93
NA,ing theoretically. The sorts of fears that we have,93
NA,are genuine fears and are based on actual hap-,93
NA,penings. In my student days I was misguided,93
NA,that the enough-becaus e I had a father who cam-,93
NA,paigned for Sir Earle Page in his electorate-,93
NA,when I heard about the formation of a new pol-,93
NA,itical party called the Liberal Party to accept the,93
NA,invitation which came into my letterbox to go to,93
NA,the inaugural meeting. I was nominated as sec-,93
NA,retary of the local branch. I declined because I,93
NA,was rather busy with studies in those days. In the,93
NA,course of my universities studies I met saner,93
NA,counsels who persuaded me that I was on the,93
NA,wrong side of the fence.,93
Mr YATES ,Whic h fence?,93
Dr EVERINGHAM,Th e political fence.,93
The CHAIRMAN,Migh t I ask the honour-,93
NA,able gentleman at this stage to please address,93
NA,himself to clause 5 (1) (b).,93
Dr EVERINGHAM, I am because I am sug-,93
NA,gesting that if a government of a certain colour,93
NA,used the law that we are debating tonight to de-,93
NA,cide that association with a party was an undesir-,93
NA,able thing and it labelled the person who,93
NA,associated with that party as somebody who was,93
NA,not favourably known which is a phrase that was,93
NA,used by the honourable member for Wills ( Mr,94
NA,Bryant)-,94
NA,"Mr Kevin Cairns-Well , relate it to clause",94
NA,5(D(b).,94
Dr EVERINGHAM, I am speaking directly to,94
NA,to the amendment which says that there ought,94
NA,be the provision that the action which leads,94
NA,surveillance is an illegal action. It was not illegal,94
NA,"for me to have attended that party meeting, but",94
NA,in later years I attended meetings of another kind,94
NA,which led to my being under surveillance by,94
NA,ASIO. I attended peace meetings. I became the,94
NA,president of a peace committee in Rockharnpton.,94
NA,I organised the Peace Conference. I put,94
NA,ganda opposing Australia's involvement in,94
NA,Vietnam-whe n Australia got to that stage-o,94
NA,the walls of my waiting room. From two,94
NA,sources I was informed that I was on thefilesof,94
NA,ASIO. One could of course say that I was para-,94
NA,noid to have believed such hearsay. One of the,94
NA,sources was a medical man who happened to be,94
NA,my partner at that time. His brother-in-law,94
NA,"worked in ASIO and he had, of course, breached",94
NA,the confidentiality of his job by informing my,94
NA,partner of certain information.,94
NA,My partner informed me of this because he felt,94
NA,uneasy about the exposure he was receiving folis,94
NA,lowing letters I had sent to a newspaper editor,94
NA,"Rockharnpton, and the discussion that went",94
NA,about the 'odd bod Everingham and his queer,94
NA,ideas'. He informed me gently that ASIO did not,94
NA,really think I was a communist but,94
NA,warning me that they were keeping an eye on,94
NA,me. I will not relate the other occasion. Never-,94
NA,theless there was no doubt in my mind that my,94
NA,name got onto thefilesof ASIO in those days.,94
NA,I received confirmation of that information.,94
NA,After I became a member of Parliament I had in,94
NA,my office a notice which declared my intention,94
NA,give moral support to young men who were defydefinition,94
NA,ing what I considered to be an unjust lawwhich,94
NA,conscription for Vietnam. I had a courteous visit,94
NA,from a courteous man in plain clothes from the,94
NA,Commonwealth Police. He questioned me at,94
NA,"length about my attitudes, involvement, knowlused",94
NA,edge and contacts regarding breaches of the conwhich,94
NA,scription law in force at that time. That did not,94
NA,stop my being promoted. I later became a MinisPrime,94
NA,ter of the Crown. I have had access on occasions,94
NA,even to secret documents. That does not mean,94
NA,that the small man who was referred to last night,94
NA,by the right honourable member for Lowe ( Sir,94
NA,William MCMahon) would have that kind of imsuggest,94
NA,munity from that kind of surveillance. The small,94
NA,man is threatened by this legislation.,94
NA,It does not matter whether he goes to a peace,94
NA,"congress, declares that he is against an unjust law",94
NA,or whether he joins a new and unheard of party,94
NA,called the Liberal Party. If the Minister of the,94
NA,day happens to see that as a security threat he,94
NA,can invoke this clause because it is wide enough,94
NA,drive a horse and cart through. Anything can,94
NA,to be represented as interfering with the plans of,94
NA,to the Government to defend the security of the,94
NA,State. Those blessed words are the talisman that,94
NA,justify every kind of totalitarianism on the face of,94
NA,the earth. Those great ringing words 'the security,94
NA,of the State' are the sort of slogan with which,94
NA,Hitler went to war and with which he legally,94
NA,took control of the German people who one,94
NA,propawould have thought were a sophisticated,94
NA,people-politicall y aware. He legally took con-,94
NA,n trol of them by using exactly the same laws and,94
NA,separate regulations as are proposed here.,94
NA,He persuaded them with suchfinespeeches as,94
NA,"the Minister delivered when he said: 'Oh, but of",94
NA,"course, you are quoting innocent cases'. I have",94
NA,no doubt that Hitler and Goebbels said exactly,94
NA,the same when people objected to the sweeping,94
NA,terms in which they wrote laws for the security of,94
NA,"the German state. Hitler would have said: 'Oh,",94
NA,but of course you are quoting innocent cases. We,94
NA,would not slaughter innocent Jews. Obviously it,94
NA,the subversive people we are getting at'. That,94
NA,in is the danger in this law and that is why the Min-,94
NA,on ister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr,94
NA,"Viner), if he has any sense about this matter and",94
NA,"any knowledge of political history, will accept",94
NA,that they were this minor amendment.,94
Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (9.24)-I raise one or,94
NA,two matters in the Australian Security Intelli-,94
NA,gence Organization Bill which are still outstand-,94
NA,ing. We have concentrated on the amendment to,94
NA,clause 5. The Government has indicated that in,94
NA,its opinion an act does not have to be unlawful to,94
NA,to be subversive. In this clause there is also the,94
NA,of acts-thi stiesin with unlawful act-,94
NA,fall within the ambit of this clause and,94
NA,which has nothing to do with the security or de-,94
NA,fence of Australia. I think it should be made clear,94
NA,in this Committee stage that this clause can be,94
NA,by the Government for civilian purposes,94
NA,have no significant security or defence ca-,94
NA,pacity. I refer to the oft repeated threats of the,94
NA,Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) to use the,94
NA,Defence Force. If they come to fruition the De-,94
NA,fence Force will be involved in civilian activities,94
NA,in this community. He has made that threat at,94
NA,least four times this year. It is a threat which I,94
NA,to the House is a danger to the standing,94
NA,of the Defence Force and can bring it into disre-,94
NA,pute. It is a matter which I am sure the Prime,94
NA,Minister would not be concerned about unless he,95
NA,scored a political point.,95
Mr YATES ,Tha t is not very fair.,95
Mr SCHOLES,To be quite honest I do not,95
NA,think he cares about anything except political,95
NA,points.,95
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,95
NA,member will come back to the question.,95
Mr VINER ,Chifle y used the defence forces.,95
Mr SCHOLES,I am quite aware that Chifley,95
NA,used that tactic. I am quite aware that at the time,95
NA,it was a matter of controversy and I am also,95
NA,aware that it was a matter of immediate and ab-,95
NA,solute national significance. I do not think that in,95
NA,any of the cases in which the Prime Minister has,95
NA,threatened this action the same situation existed.,95
NA,I make the point that in recent weeks there has,95
NA,been all the evidence of a build-up of a campaign,95
NA,to create a confrontation situation relating to the,95
NA,mining and export of uranium. Should such a,95
NA,situation occur where those people who have,95
NA,genuine objections to the mining and export of,95
NA,uranium seek to take action to demonstrate that,95
NA,proposition-an d the Prime Minister uses his,95
NA,"national security powers, as I am sure he would if",95
NA,he thought it was politically advantageous to,95
NA,bring the Army in on a pretext of national,95
NA,"security-an d picket, demonstrate or in any other",95
NA,"way protest against the loading, shipping or",95
NA,"movement of that uranium, they will find them-",95
NA,selves in breach of the terms of this clause and be,95
NA,deemed to be carrying out acts of subversion.,95
NA,I will use an example of a previous time under,95
NA,a similar clause. Those persons who objected in,95
NA,1939 to the shipment of pig iron to Japan to,95
NA,make armaments for later use against Australia,95
NA,were most likely better patriots than the persons,95
NA,who tried to prevent that Act. Those persons,95
NA,would have been guilty of subversion had the,95
NA,Defence Force been brought in either to move,95
NA,that pig iron over the wharves or to protect the,95
NA,movement of that pig iron over the wharves and,95
NA,other activities which were being picketed. I re-,95
NA,mind the House that there is no provision in this,95
NA,Bill for any audit of the actions of the security,95
NA,ganisations. There is no provision for any exam-,95
NA,ination of the files that are created or of their,95
NA,contents and no provision for any person to chal-,95
NA,lenge the existence of a file in his name or to try,95
NA,to establish that the charge of subversion which,95
NA,is inherent in the establishment of a file under,95
NA,this clause is a charge which is unwarranted. A,95
NA,person acting in good conscience on a matter,95
NA,"which has a content of conscience can, because",95
NA,he disagrees with the government of the day,95
NA,which has chosen to use its powers in a way,95
NA,"which may be inadvisable but is legal, finds him-",95
NA,self declared as a subversive.,95
NA,An extensive inquiry has just been carried out,95
NA,by a committee of this Parliament into the denial,95
NA,of civil liberties to persons in the Soviet Union.,95
NA,The clause before the Committee is not greatly,95
NA,different from the law in the Soviet Union which,95
NA,"permits breaches of civil liberties to occur. We, as",95
NA,"a Parliament, feel justified in inquiring into them",95
NA,and complaining about them in this country and,95
NA,throughout the world. The framework is very,95
NA,"much the same. The way is open, in the light of",95
NA,the legal incompetence which has been demon-,95
NA,"strated in this chamber tonight, to extending that",95
NA,framework by administrative action and,95
NA,regulation.,95
NA,Very wide ranging powers exist in Acts which,95
NA,have been passed by this Parliament over a,95
NA,number of years. I point out to those honourable,95
NA,members who do not remember the amend-,95
NA,ments to the Crimes Act of 1961 that the sort of,95
NA,example which the Minister gave is beyond,95
NA,being ludicrous. It is an offence under the Com-,95
NA,monwealth Crimes Act and other Acts of Parlia-,95
NA,ment to approach a defence establishment. I do,95
NA,not make fun of the Minister's speech. I am,95
NA,alarmed that a person who in this House rep-,95
NA,resents the Attorney-General should make such,95
NA,a speech showing his complete and utter disre-,95
NA,gard for the facts.,95
Mr GRAHAM ,Ho w many people have been,95
NA,charged under it?,95
Mr SCHOLES,No one has ever been,95
NA,"charged, but under this legislation persons can",95
NA,be deemed to be subversives without being,95
NA,"charged, without the right of defence and with-",95
NA,out committing any illegal act. That is the conse-,95
NA,quence of this clause. A person can be said to be,95
NA,a subversive without having committed an illegal,95
NA,act. Commission of an illegal act in this field is,95
NA,extremely easy because of the wide ranging pro-,95
NA,visions of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and,95
NA,the State Crimes Acts.,95
Mr GRAHAM ,Don' t you know that the,95
NA,"orCamerons, the Grahams and the Campbells",95
NA,have for 400 years been hated by the English?,95
NA,Don't you understand anything about history?,95
Mr SCHOLES,I fancy that the O'Learys do,95
NA,"not like the English, but I do not think that has",95
NA,anything to do with subversion or with this legis-,95
NA,lation. The fact is that the Commonwealth,95
NA,Crimes Act and the State Crimes Acts are ad-,95
NA,equate to cover any subversive activity which is,95
NA,likely to occur in Australia. Any person who,95
NA,takes part in what in fact is subversion is entitled,95
NA,to be charged. No person ever has been charged.,95
NA,"In fact, the only person in the history of this",96
NA,country seriously challenged with that sort of,96
NA,action was a member of this Parliament. He was,96
NA,expelled because he was an Irishman and was,96
NA,honest about it. That happened on 11 November,96
NA,1920. Honourable members should remember,96
NA,the date.,96
NA,The wording of this clause is designed to re-,96
NA,strict civil liberties. It provides no protection of,96
NA,civil liberties. The Minister's speech indicates,96
NA,quite clearly that the Government is prepared to,96
NA,go to any length at all in regard to this legislation.,96
NA,It is even prepared to mislead the Parliament,96
NA,and to give deliberately false examples. I cannot,96
NA,use any other term. The Minister must know bet-,96
NA,ter. He cannot be that incompetent; it is,96
NA,impossible.,96
Mr VINER ,"Coul d you get him to withdraw,",96
NA,Mr Chairman?,96
Mr SCHOLES,"I withdraw, but I would have",96
NA,thought that if the Minister believed what he said,96
NA,he would not be prepared to admit that he was,96
NA,"that incompetent at law, especially in his role as",96
NA,representing the Attorney-General of the,96
NA,Commonwealth.,96
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-H e only gave that as an,96
NA,example.,96
Mr SCHOLES,It was a dreadful example.,96
The CHAIRMAN,Let us get the situation,96
NA,clear. Has the honourable member for Corio,96
NA,withdrawn his remark?,96
Mr SCHOLES,I have withdrawn the re-,96
NA,mark. I complete my remarks by saying that the,96
NA,clause is a danger to civil liberties. I hope that the,96
NA,Committee rejects it.,96
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,96
NA,member's time has expired.,96
Mr VINER ,Stirling-Minister for Employ-,96
NA,ment and Youth Affairs) (9.35)- I shall deal,96
NA,very briefly with the argument that has been put,96
NA,forward. I think that the argument put by the,96
NA,honourable member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr,96
NA,Holding) in answer to the example I gave really,96
NA,proves the point. The proposition put forward by,96
NA,the Opposition was that it would allow to the,96
NA,Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,96
NA,only the authority to keep under surveillance,96
NA,"anybody who had in mind an activity, such as",96
NA,"bombing HMAS Melbourne which obstructed,",96
NA,hindered or interfered with the Defence Force,96
NA,when an illegal act had been committed. An il-,96
NA,legal act can be committed earlier than the press-,96
NA,ing of a button by remote control to ignite a,96
NA,bomb. The point is that the Opposition would,96
NA,deny to ASIO the opportunity to keep under sur-,96
NA,veillance a person committing an act which does,96
NA,not constitute an illegal act. I think that in the ex-,96
NA,ercise of common sense one would say that ASIO,96
NA,ought to have the authority to keep under sur-,96
NA,veillance a person who is engaging in an activity,96
NA,which falls short of an unlawful act but which is,96
NA,"directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering",96
NA,with the functions of the Defence Force. So my,96
NA,example served the purpose of drawing out the,96
NA,Opposition and showing the fallacy of its,96
NA,proposition.,96
NA,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports,96
NA,also said that this clause deals with the crime of,96
NA,subversion. It does not. It does not create an,96
NA,offence; it does not make a person guilty of an,96
NA,offence when he engages in an activity which is,96
NA,directed towards the end result. The clause gives,96
NA,authority to ASIO to keep under surveillance,96
NA,people who are engaging in this kind of activity.,96
NA,It is always a salutary exercise to invite,96
NA,members of the Opposition to consider them-,96
NA,selves sitting on the Government side of the,96
NA,House. What would they say if they directed the,96
NA,Defence Force to carry out a certain task in the,96
NA,defence interests or security interests of the,96
NA,country? Would not the Deputy Leader of the,96
NA,Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) or any member,96
NA,of this House expect a Labor government to tell,96
NA,its security organisation to inform it about any,96
NA,"persons activities, either lawful or unlawful,",96
NA,which are directed towards obstructing the very,96
NA,function which it had commanded the Defence,96
NA,Force of this country to carry out in the interests,96
NA,of the defence of this country? Would a Labor,96
NA,government say to its security organisation that it,96
NA,is not interested in getting advice on any activity,96
NA,which is directed towards obstructing the very,96
NA,purpose for which the Government had sent the,96
NA,Defence Force on its way? Of course not. That,96
NA,points out the fallacy of the Opposition's,96
NA,proposition.,96
NA,As this debate has unfolded and as we have,96
NA,"dealt with clause after clause, I have been driven",96
NA,inevitably to the conclusion that the honourable,96
NA,member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) does not believe,96
NA,that an intelligence organisation should exist in,96
NA,Australia.,96
Mr SCHOLES , I object to that remark. It is a de-,96
NA,liberate lie by the Minister. He is the biggest liar,96
NA,in the Parliament.,96
The CHAIRMAN,Order!,96
Mr SCHOLES ,"H e is a dirty, filthy low liar.",96
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,96
NA,member for Corio-,96
Mr SCHOLES ,Yo u let him say that. You knew,97
NA,he was doing it.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,97
NA,member for Corio was very quick off the mark.,97
Mr SCHOLES , I will hit him in the mouth if he,97
NA,"says it again, I tell you now.",97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,97
NA,member of Corio-,97
Mr SCHOLES ,H e is filthy low liar. He is not fit,97
NA,to be in the Parliament.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order!,97
Mr SCHOLES , I withdraw.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,97
NA,member for Corio will resume his seat. Under,97
NA,the circumstances the Minister will withdraw the,97
NA,statement that the honourable member for Corio,97
NA,was deliberately misleading the Committee.,97
Mr VINER, I did not say that the honourable,97
NA,member was misleading the Committee.,97
Mr SCHOLES ,Yo u did so.,97
NA,MrVINER-Ididnot.,97
Mr SCHOLES ,Yo u are a liar.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,97
NA,member for Corio!,97
Mr SCHOLES ,Yo u are a disgrace to your pro-,97
NA,fession and to this Parliament.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,97
NA,member for Corio surprises me.,97
Mr SCHOLES ,Whe n a man is entitled to say,97
NA,that in this Parliament the Parliament is in,97
NA,disrepute.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! To the best of the,97
NA,recollection of the Chair there was a direct impu-,97
NA,"tation, in words that I cannot precisely recall,",97
NA,that the honourable member for Corio was,97
NA,deliberately misleading the Committee.,97
Mr VINER," Mr Chairman, if you think that",97
NA,what I said requires withdrawing I will certainly,97
NA,withdraw it. I said: 'As I listen to the honourable,97
NA,member I am driven to the conclusion that he,97
NA,does not believe that there should be a security,97
NA,organisation in Australia'.,97
Mr SCHOLES ,Tha t is a lie. You cannot,97
NA,establish that by any part of my speech or from,97
NA,any remark that I have ever made in this,97
NA,chamber. It is a filthy he by a man who is,97
NA,deliberately trying to downgrade my reputation,97
NA,for political purposes. He is a disgrace to the Par-,97
NA,"liament. Mr Chairman, you ought to throw him",97
NA,out for repeating it.,97
NA,Mr Ruddock-Yo u are going too far.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The Committee,97
NA,will come to order. The honourable member for,97
NA,Dundas is not assisting.,97
Mr SCHOLES ,Yo u are a lawyer. You know,97
NA,that I did not say anything like that.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order! The honourable,97
NA,member for Corio will come to order.,97
Mr SCHOLES ,I t is a misrepresentation by a,97
NA,man who is being an assailant.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Order!,97
Mr VINER," Mr Chairman, if the honourable",97
NA,"gentleman wishes me to withdraw, I will",97
NA,withdraw.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Th e Chair will rule on the,97
NA,matter. The Chair takes note of the Minister's,97
NA,willingness to withdraw. Before calling on the,97
NA,"Minister to withdraw, consistent with his offer, I",97
NA,suggest to the honourable member for Corio that,97
NA,the comment by the Minister that he was drawn,97
NA,"to the conclusion did not, in itself, insist that that",97
NA,was the case. It was a rhetorical proposition. In,97
NA,view of the honourable member's objection and,97
NA,as the Minister has indicated that he will with-,97
NA,"draw, I ask him so to do. The honourable",97
NA,member for Corio will be required to withdraw,97
NA,"the expressions he made, to the surprise of the",97
NA,"Committee, I am sure. Does the Minister",97
NA,withdraw?,97
Mr VINER,Yes.,97
The CHAIRMAN,Doe s the honourable,97
NA,member for Corio withdraw?,97
Mr SCHOLES ," Mr Chairman, I withdraw the re-",97
NA,marks 1 made. But I make it clear to the House,97
NA,that I occupy a position in the chamber that I,97
NA,take seriously. I am responsible to the Opposition,97
NA,for matters of defence. I consider that my ability,97
NA,to carry out those functions is damaged by state-,97
NA,ments such as that made by the Minister. If a,97
NA,"Minister, without any evidence at all, tries to im-",97
NA,"pute that type of statement to me, then the Minis-",97
NA,ter is deliberately seeking to damage my repu-,97
NA,tation in a manner which I think is beyond his,97
NA,rights as a member of this Parliament and be-,97
NA,yond the rights of any member of this Parlia-,97
NA,ment. I consider that I am entitled to be upset be-,97
NA,"cause I made no such remarks. Mr Chairman, as",97
NA,"you are well aware, I started my remarks by say-",97
NA,ing that any person who seeks to inhibit-,97
NA,"Mr Kevin Cairns-Oh , come on!",97
Mr SCHOLES ,Thi s is a serious matter. The,97
NA,Minister has challenged my reputation and my,97
NA,integrity and if that is not entitled to be defended,97
NA,"in the Parliament, then what is?",97
The CHAIRMAN,Order ! The honourable,98
NA,member for Corio will appreciate that there is,98
NA,another way in which his explanation can be,98
NA,made.,98
Mr SCHOLES ,A s soon as the Minister sits,98
NA,"down, I will make a personal explanation under",98
NA,Standing Order 64.,98
The CHAIRMAN,Ha s the honourable,98
NA,member for Corio withdrawn the expression?,98
Mr SCHOLES ,"Yes , I have withdrawn the",98
NA,expression.,98
The CHAIRMAN,Ha s the Minister,98
NA,concluded his remarks?,98
Mr VINER ,"Yes , Mr Chairman.",98
Mr SCHOLES ,"Corio )- Mr Chairman, I wish",98
NA,to make a personal explanation about a matter,98
NA,on which I have been misrepresented.,98
The CHAIRMAN,Th e honourable member,98
NA,may proceed.,98
Mr SCHOLES,A t the commencement of my,98
NA,remarks on this clause I said-th e Minister for,98
NA,Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) is,98
NA,aware that I said this because he queried the,98
NA,actual terminology-tha t any person who seeks,98
NA,in any way to inhibit the defence forces of this,98
NA,country in the carrying out of duties connected,98
NA,with the security or the defence of this country,98
NA,not only deserves to be deemed to be a subvers-,98
NA,ive but also to be acted against as a subversive.,98
NA,That is a clear and absolute statement. It is one to,98
NA,which I hold and one in which in no way can one,98
NA,find a derivation such as the one that the Minister,98
NA,attempted to place upon it for his own political,98
NA,purposes. I repeat that the position I hold as the,98
NA,Opposition's spokesman on defence is one that I,98
NA,take seriously and that type of suggestion-,98
The CHAIRMAN,Th e honourable member,98
NA,is debating the issue. He has pointed out where,98
NA,he has been misrepresented.,98
Mr SCHOLES,I realise that. I shallfinishin,98
NA,"a sentence, Mr Chairman. The making of that",98

Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith),98
NA,(9.54)-b y leave-Agai n relating to the overall,98
NA,"definition of'subversion', I move:",98
NA,"Clause 5, page 3, line 13, omit 'or hatred'.",98
NA,"At the present time, in an endeavour to define",98
NA,"what is subversion, the clause reads:",98
NA,(c) activities directed to promoting violence or hatred be-,98
NA,tween different groups of persons in the Australian com-,98
NA,"munity so as to endanger the peace, order or good govern-",98
NA,ment of the Commonwealth.,98
NA,to. We all recognise that nobody wants to endanger,98
NA,"the peace, order or good government of the",98
NA,Commonwealth. We also recognise that people,98
NA,who provoke violence are certainly acting in a,98
NA,32 subversive way. But when we come to this ques-,98
NA,"64 tion of hatred, we get into the mental approach",98
NA,to what we are all about. We cannot identify,98
NA,32 hatred by any particular positive or physical act.,98
NA,This thing called hatred becomes a frame of,98
NA,"mind, an attitude towards a group of other",99
NA,people or towards another country. It can relate,99
NA,to religious differences and to all sorts of unfortu-,99
NA,"nate human frailties. It is a bit like anger, which",99
NA,we saw in the chamber in the last few minutes. It,99
NA,is very much one of those matters which cannot,99
NA,be put into legislation.,99
NA,"In the Senate, we were somewhat successful",99
NA,"because, prior to containing the word 'hatred',",99
NA,the clause had contained the word 'hostility'.,99
NA,were arguing for the deletion of the words 'or,99
NA,hostility'. We did not seem to be too successful,99
NA,because for some extraordinary reason we got,99
NA,of the words 'or hostility' and wound up with,99
NA,words 'or hatred'. For the life of me I cannot,99
NA,"how the Government, in its wisdom, felt that",99
NA,"was improving the situation, succumbing in any",99
NA,way to the oratory of the Opposition,99
NA,Senate or saving the situation by removing the,99
NA,words 'or hostility' and putting in the words 'or,99
NA,hatred'. It comes down again to what we are,99
NA,"about. When we are talking about subversion,",99
NA,we want to get the definitions right. The,99
NA,that we want to make is that this definition is,99
NA,adequate and misses what we are all about.,99
NA,Activities directed towards promoting hatred,99
NA,within the community may well need to,99
NA,"outlawed. For example, there is a federal law",99
NA,which deals with racial discrimination and racial,99
NA,hatred. There are any number of State laws,99
NA,which prevent people from committing breaches,99
NA,of the peace. Most of these laws are products,99
NA,the last century and could well be infringements,99
NA,of civil liberties.,99
NA,"However, to have the Australian Security Inful",99
NA,telligence Organisation involved in the question,99
NA,whether people are seeking to promote hatred,99
NA,"quite undesirable. For example, in this place",99
NA,honourable members put their points of view,99
NA,very strongly about such issues as human remote,99
NA,"lations, sexuality and the question of abortion.",99
NA,Such dicussions can create the most serious,99
NA,tensions between people. The Parliament itself,99
NA,involved in these matters in which an enormous,99
NA,amount of hatred is displayed. We can try to,99
NA,excuse it to some extent because people get,99
NA,"volved, but we would not dare to suggest that",99
NA,these people are guilty of subversion. That is,99
NA,point. The expression of such feelings has,99
NA,"nothing to do with the peace, order and good",99
NA,"government ofthe nation, but those who express",99
NA,them exhibit a lot of what we are about-hate -,99
NA,which is one of the seven deadly sins. There,99
NA,needs to be a definition which contains what,99
NA,are all about-th e concept of violence. That is,99
NA,what this is about. The subversion must be,99
NA,"directed to a violent act, that is, the overthrow or",99
NA,ruin of a government.,99
NA,Clause 5 is far too widely drafted. We think,99
NA,that hatred is a phenomenon that we can do,99
NA,"without, but it has nothing to do with subversion.",99
NA,I have kept my remarks within a short space of,99
NA,time because I think this matter is obvious to,99
NA,everybody-th e Government included. In the,99
NA,Senate the Government was prepared to do,99
NA,something towards improving this tedious,99
NA,We method we have to adopt to try to improve legis-,99
NA,"lative drafting, but it seems to have fallen from",99
NA,one deep pit into another deep pit. How in the,99
NA,rid name of fortune are we going to work out,99
NA,the whether people are exhibiting hatred towards,99
NA,see each other or towards other nations? Clause 5,99
NA,it would be weakened in no way by the exclusion,99
NA,of the words 'or hatred' in accordance with the,99
NA,in the amendment which has been moved.,99
Mr KEVIN CAIRNS ,LUley) (lO.O)-This,99
NA,all matter is not quite so obvious as the Deputy,99
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, the honourable",99
NA,point member for Kingsford-Smith ( Mr Lionel,99
NA,"inBowen), might pretend it to be. This clause deals",99
NA,with activities which are directed to promoting,99
NA,"violence so as to endanger the peace, order and",99
NA,be good government of the Commonwealth. It,99
NA,deals also with activities directed to promoting,99
NA,"hatred so as to endanger the peace, order and",99
NA,good government of the Commonwealth. The,99
NA,Opposition suggests that the words 'or hatred' be,99
NA,of deleted. One ought to have clearly in mind the,99
NA,consequences of deleting those words. The word,99
NA,which appeared in the sentence previously had,99
NA,been 'hostility'. The words 'or hatred' appear in,99
NA,that position at the moment. One has to be care-,99
NA,that in deleting words such as these one does,99
NA,not make the task of those who have to place,99
NA,is others under surveillance almost impossible.,99
NA,We know that there are people who will pro-,99
NA,hatred for the purposes of endangering the,99
NA,"peace, order or good government of the Com-",99
NA,of monwealth. Those people deserve to be under,99
NA,is surveillance. Their activities deserve to be,99
NA,viewed. So the whole clause concerns an incite-,99
NA,ment to people to do certain activities which en-,99
NA,so indanger the Commonwealth. I can imagine many,99
NA,cases in which violence wUl be promoted. This is,99
NA,the a danger. The Opposition agrees that we should,99
NA,examine that activity. The clever people do not,99
NA,promote violence directly. They do not get them-,99
NA,selves directly involved in violence. The clever,99
NA,people fall just short of it. They may promote all,99
NA,the circumstances in which violence wUl occur,99
NA,we and which will result in the injury to the Com-,99
NA,monwealth that is nominated in clause 5 (1 )(c).,99
NA,One could take an overseas example. One could,99
NA,consider Ireland at the moment. One knows that,100
NA,in certain respects Ireland can be tinder dry in,100
NA,"terms of a conflagration, and I am not talking",100
NA,about a bush fire. The clever people will not pro-,100
NA,mote violence directly. They know that by pro-,100
NA,moting hatred they can gain a certain result.,100
NA,The affect of the amendment proposed by the,100
NA,Opposition is the attitude: Such people are not,100
NA,worth watching. They are not worth keeping an,100
NA,eye on. We say that they are. Let us have a look,100
NA,at some examples that have occurred in other,100
NA,countries. In Czechoslovakia in the late 1930s,100
NA,there was tension among what I call the Ger-,100
NA,manic groups. Some of that tension took the,100
NA,form of physical violence. Much of it was caused,100
NA,by hatred that was promoted among the groups,100
NA,in Czechoslovakia. The hatred that was,100
NA,promoted was as subversive-i n fact history,100
NA,verifies it-a s the actual physical violence that,100
NA,was promoted. The effect of the amendment,100
NA,proposed by the Opposition would be to require,100
NA,surveillance of those people who are promoting,100
NA,physical violence but not of those who are pro-,100
NA,moting the cause of physical violence. I suggest,100
NA,that to produce that kind of gap in clause,100
NA,5 (I) (c) would be very serious indeed and that,100
NA,ought to be resisted. The Deputy Leader of the,100
NA,Opposition spoke for a short time. I will not take,100
NA,my full time. But I would add this: Australia has,100
NA,many ethnic groups. People come from overseas,100
NA,with legitimately high feelings and with very,100
NA,great loyalties. Nobody disputes that prop-,100
NA,osition. But situations can arise among groups in,100
NA,a community and hatred can be promoted which,100
NA,"would cause, and which would have the inten-",100
NA,"tion of causing, an injury to the Commonwealth.",100
NA,The promotion of such hostility or hatred with an,100
NA,intention that I have mentioned deserves to be,100
NA,watched. It should not be ignored. For those,100
NA,reasons I suggest that the clause deserves to be,100
NA,supported and that the proposal to delete the,100
NA,words 'or hatred' would leave a gap that would,100
NA,be impossible to fill.,100
Mr WEST ,Cunningham) (10.4)-Clause Timorese,100
NA,5 (1) (c) attempts to define the meaning of subin,100
NA,"version. The clause, in part, defines subversion",100
NA,as:,100
NA,activities directed to promoting violence or hatred,100
NA,tween different groups of persons in the Australian com-,100
NA,"munity so as to endanger the peace, order or good",100
NA,ment of the Commonwealth.,100
NA,In examining this provision two points emerge.,100
NA,"Because subversion is a subjective concept,",100
NA,Government is obliged to attempt to define,100
NA,impossible.,100
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-Yo u have to make some,100
NA,judgment.,100
Mr WEST,"The Government is attempting,",100
NA,"in a very loose way, to do the impossible. Subver-",100
NA,sion is really not definable because it depends,100
NA,upon the political view in the eye ofthe beholder.,100
NA,"Concepts of democracy have been, and still are",100
NA,"in some countries, classified as being subversive.",100
NA,Five hundred years ago the idea of the earth,100
NA,being round was considered subversive. In,100
NA,Europe a few hundred years ago the suggestion,100
NA,that the earth revolved around the sun was so,100
NA,heretical that one could have been burned at the,100
NA,stake for expressing it. I do not want to give any,100
NA,"history lessons, but perhaps I may be permitted",100
NA,one example. The great astronomer Copernicus,100
NA,withheld for 36 years the publication ofhis revol-,100
NA,utionary work concerning the movement of the,100
NA,"heavenly spheres, for fear of joining the thou-",100
NA,sands of heretics in the great fifteenth century,100
NA,auto-da-fe. So we are trying here to define the,100
NA,impossible; to define subversion is to attempt to,100
NA,define the impossible.,100
NA,"Therefore, the Government moves, in a very",100
NA,"broad way, to apply that concept to the word",100
NA,'hatred'. In so doing the wording used is almost,100
NA,as stupidly vague as it is in clause 5 (a). How can,100
NA,one legislate to control human emotions? How,100
NA,can one legislate to control human emotions in,100
NA,political situations? How is the word 'hatred' to,100
NA,be defined? This stupid Government really seeks,100
NA,to produce a sterile world. It is really like the,100
NA,world which Jonathan Swift outlined 250 years,100
NA,"ago, a world in which there was no emotion, no",100
NA,"hatred, no politics. That was the world of the",100
NA,"Houyhnhnms, which he denned in the last book",100
NA,of Gulliver's Travels. The Government wants a,100
NA,"strictly-controlled world, as Orwell imagined in",100
NA,"1984. But the question is, how would the Bill op-",100
NA,erate? In this respect whom would clause 5 (c),100
NA,cover? Does the Government imagine that it,100
NA,would cover the situation of the Croatians in,100
NA,"their hatred of the government of Marshal Tito,",100
NA,the Chileans in their hatred of the military junta,100
NA,"of Colonel Pinochet, or the attitude of East",100
NA,"in Australia, particularly those who are",100
NA,"Darwin, who certainly will have a continuing",100
NA,objection to the present regime in Indonesia,100
NA,under General Suharto? Perhaps it could also be,100
NA,applied to pensioners and their organisations,100
NA,be- which seek to achieve a better deal for their,100
NA,governmembers-a s they did recently in their struggle,100
NA,to achieve half-yearly indexation.,100
NA,The domestic group that has the most reason,100
NA,this to hate the Government is the unemployed.,100
NA,the When one understands what the Government is,100
NA,doing to this group one understands that many,100
NA,unemployed people would have good reason to,100
NA,hate the Government and all that it stands for.,100
NA,Are they too to be persecuted under clause 5 (c),101
NA,"if they attempt to organise, say, a great national",101
NA,body whose aim is to remove this Government,101
NA,"from power? Their leaders would, of course, be",101
NA,put under surveillance by the Australian Security,101
NA,Intelligence Organisation. Government,101
NA,members are having themselves on if they claim,101
NA,that that is not so. The fact is that in this matter a,101
NA,judgment must be made. That is why I object to,101
NA,what the Government is doing. Who will have to,101
NA,make the judgment? We of the Opposition have,101
NA,no confidence in the people in ASIO who will,101
NA,have to make the judgment. The Deputy Leader,101
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) quoted,101
NA,several passages from the Hope report to make,101
NA,his point. I will read again one quote and back it,101
NA,up with another. Mr Justice Hope made a damn-,101
NA,ing indictment of ASIO's past activities when he,101
NA,said:,101
NA,. . . intelligence assessment is no simple or routine ac-,101
NA,tivity but a highly skilled and subtle task.,101
NA,saw little evidence in ASIO that,101
NA,"pertise needed wererecognised,or available in any large",101
NA,measure.,101
NA,"At page 236 of the report, paragraph 680 reads:",101
NA,There is evidence to show that ASIO has in the past pro-,101
NA,vided selected people with security intelligence material for,101
NA,publication. The material provided was apparently drawn,101
NA,from information available in the public arena. It seems to,101
NA,have been ASIO's intention that the material be not,101
NA,attributed to it. A propaganda activity of this kind by ASIO is,101
NA,a misconceived enterprise. It crosses the boundary between,101
NA,"provision of information, which is proper, and the taking of a",101
NA,"' measure for security', which is not proper.",101
NA,That illustrates the track record of ASIO. That is,101
NA,the organisation which this Government is ask-,101
NA,ing us to have confidence in to define the activi-,101
NA,ties of groups of people who might be guilty of,101
NA,promoting hatred against the Commonwealth. It,101
NA,is little wonder that we of the Opposition do not,101
NA,trust the objectivity of ASIO's agents when we,101
NA,look at that sort of material which has been writ-,101
NA,"ten by the learned Justice Hope and, I add, the",101
NA,report on which this legislation is based.,101
NA,Throughout history man has abhorred the activi-,101
NA,"ties of the biased pimp, the lying informer, the",101
NA,intolerant fanatic who allows himself to be used,101
NA,as a weapon of the police state. Throughout his-,101
NA,"tory men of democracy, great writers and",101
NA,"thinkers, men such as Cicero from ancient Rome,",101
NA,Jonathan Swift from England and Orwell of the,101
NA,"twentieth century, all feared informers with the",101
NA,clearest of vision.,101
NA,Mr Carlton- I wouldn't quote Cicero.,101
Mr WEST, I will quote Cicero because I,101
NA,know that it will be above your head. In the de-,101
NA,"fence ofthe Roman republic, he once said:",101
NA,Even if these liberators and protectors of ours have with-,101
NA,"drawn from our sight, they have left behind them the",101
NA,example of their deeds.,101
NA,I think that that is applicable to ASIO of,101
NA,Australia in the twentieth century. We cannot,101
NA,trust these people in ASIO to make subjective,101
NA,definitions of a word such as 'hatred'. It is far too,101
NA,broad. That word ought to be removed from,101
NA,clause 5 (1) (c).,101
Mr RUDDOCK ,Dundas) (10.13)-In some,101
NA,respects one does not feel that one should be in-,101
NA,"volved in the debate as much as one has been,",101
NA,but when one hears a speech like the one we,101
NA,have just heard from the honourable member for,101
NA,Cunningham ( Mr West) one cannot fail to be ex-,101
NA,ceedingly disappointed and with good reason,101
NA,because the honourable member has attempted,101
NA,to use exaggeration to persuade people that there,101
NA,is something sinister in clause 5 (1) (c).,101
NA,Mr West-Tha t was not exaggeration; that,101
NA,I must report that I was the Hope report I read.,101
NA,the qualities of mind and ex-,101
Mr RUDDOCK,It is not a question of quot-,101
NA,ing from the Hope report; it is not a question of,101
NA,quoting events of the past. It is a question of,101
NA,looking at the words that the honourable,101
NA,member has just used in his speech because what,101
NA,the honourable member has suggested is that the,101
NA,"words in paragraph (c), which is under dis-",101
NA,cussion and which the Opposition seeks to,101
NA,amend-an d these are the words of the honour-,101
NA,able member-ar e 'legislating to control human,101
NA,emotions in political terms'. No reasonable man,101
NA,looking at the words in this paragraph could say,101
NA,that the legislation is designed to control human,101
NA,emotions in political terms. No one in looking at,101
NA,the scheme of this paragraph could reasonably,101
NA,argue that it is the basis for persecution of indi-,101
NA,viduals. No reasonable person picking up the,101
NA,words of the honourable member could look at,101
NA,the clause that is under discussion and say: 'That,101
NA,forms the foundation for the establishment of a,101
NA,police state'. These are the words that he was,101
NA,using in his address-emotiv e words-t o try to,101
NA,describe what this Organisation would have the,101
NA,capacity to do. If one looks objectively at the,101
NA,"clause, there is no way that one could construe it",101
NA,in that way.,101
NA,Let us go back to the clause and see what it is,101
NA,attempting to do. It is dealing with the definition,101
NA,"of subversion, which is one of the operative",101
NA,words in defining security. Security is relevant,101
NA,because it is the basis upon which the Organis-,101
NA,"ation is given a precise capacity to obtain, corre-",101
NA,"late and evaluate intelligence, that is, to obtain",101
NA,information. This clause in relation to subversion,101
NA,refers to activities directed to promoting violence,101
NA,or hatred between different groups of persons in,101
NA,the Australian community so as to endanger- I,102
NA,put emphasis on the word 'endanger'-th e,102
NA,"peace, order or good government of the Com-",102
NA,monwealth. We have to look at the total scheme.,102
NA,We cannot just pick out the words that we want,102
NA,to pick out and say that subversion comprises,102
NA,activities directed to promoting violence or,102
NA,hatred. It is not that. The full wording has to be,102
NA,looked at. It refers to those activities directed to,102
NA,"promoting hatred so as to endanger the peace,",102
NA,order or good government of the Common-,102
NA,wealth. In no way could any of the examples,102
NA,given by the honourable member for,102
NA,Cunningham-eve n if one wanted to give cre-,102
NA,dence to his argument-involvin g pensioners or,102
NA,the unemployed could be construed as constitut-,102
NA,ing the promotion of hatred between different,102
NA,"groups so as to endanger the peace, order or",102
NA,good government of the Commonwealth. That is,102
NA,how far we have to go in our consideration. It is,102
NA,not a question of just promoting hatred. It is a,102
NA,quesuon of promoting it to the extent that it en-,102
NA,"dangers the peace, order or good government of",102
NA,the Commonwealth. I am repeating that a,102
NA,number of times because I suspect I have to do,102
NA,that to get it through to the honourable member,102
NA,for Cunningham. The fact of the matter is that,102
NA,there are quite specific examples-,102
NA,Mr West-Wh o makes the judgments?,102
Mr RUDDOCK,I will come back to the mat-,102
NA,ter of judgment in a moment. The fact of the,102
NA,matter is that examples have been given and I,102
NA,think the honourable member for Lilley ( Mr,102
NA,"Kevin Cairns) picked a good one, of how people",102
NA,can promote hatred between people of different,102
NA,racial or religious backgrounds-w e have seen it,102
NA,in some countries of the world and we do not,102
NA,"want it here-t o such a degree that the peace,",102
NA,order or good government of a country can be,102
NA,endangered. Who would not at least want to,102
NA,know what those people are doing? Who would,102
NA,not at least want to know what they were about?,102
NA,"It is not a matter of persecuting people, turning",102
NA,the country into a police state; it is a question of,102
NA,finding out that information and making it avail-,102
NA,able to the Government. That is all ASIO does. It,102
NA,"does not pick people up in the street, take them",102
NA,off to gaol and prosecute them in the courts. It is,102
NA,merely an organisation for collecting,102
NA,information.,102
NA,"The honourable member for Cunningham,",102
NA,"who interjected a little while ago, asked who was",102
NA,"to make these judgments. Of course, the person",102
NA,who primarily or ultimately has to make the,102
NA,judgment is the Director-General. What we have,102
NA,heard is that that man is a most outstanding indi-,102
NA,vidual. Honourable members opposite have,102
NA,lauded his praises right through this debate.,102
NA,They have spoken of him as having the highest,102
NA,qualities and being a most suitable Director-,102
NA,General. Honourable members opposite take,102
NA,pride in having appointed Mr Justice,102
NA,"Woodward. Ultimately, when a judgment has to",102
NA,be made-i f there is any concern about it-i t is,102
NA,the judgment of the Director-General. He is a,102
NA,man in whom we have a great deal of faith. In,102
NA,terms of what the Opposition has accepted with-,102
NA,"out offering further amendments, he is a man in",102
NA,whom we have already put a great deal of trust.,102
NA,We can take it funher. Look at the other individ-,102
NA,uals in the Organisation who may have to make,102
NA,some determinations. They are the individuals in,102
NA,"whom for other purposes, even accepting the",102
NA,amendments proposed by honourable members,102
NA,"opposite, that trust has been placed. The honour-",102
NA,able member for Cunningham is asking: 'Why,102
NA,would you trust that person with this decision in,102
NA,relation to whether the activity is directed to pro-,102
NA,moting hatred? Why trust that same individual,102
NA,in relation to activities directed to promoting,102
NA,violence? If we do not trust him in relation to,102
NA,"hatred, why trust him in relation to violence?'",102
NA,The fact is that somebody has to have that re-,102
NA,sponsibility. It is appropriate that ultimately it,102
NA,will be in the hands of the Director-General. Of,102
NA,course we trust him. The Opposition trusts him in,102
NA,"relation to most matters, but some Opposition",102
NA,members are not prepared to trust him in re-,102
NA,lation to this matter. I find that argument quite,102
NA,specious.,102
NA,"There are situations which, on the balance of",102
NA,"probabilities, warrant surveillance and warrant",102
NA,our being aware of certain activities because of,102
NA,"their very nature, particularly those directed to",102
NA,promoting violence or hatred between groups,102
NA,"that endanger the peace, order or good govern-",102
NA,"ment of the Commonwealth, which have the",102
NA,character described by the honourable member,102
NA,for Lilley ( Mr Kevin Cairns). On the balance of,102
NA,"probabilities, there are probably many of those",102
NA,circumstances. There might be circumstances,102
NA,"which, notwithstanding the qualifications I have",102
NA,"made about the peace, order and good govern-",102
NA,"ment of the Commonwealth, could still be a little",102
NA,more innocent in terms of the description used by,102
NA,the honourable member for Cunningham. We,102
NA,have to make a judgment as to whether circum-,102
NA,stances which come within this definition ought,102
NA,to be the subject of surveillance. I acknowledge,102
NA,that there may be some difficulty in defining the,102
NA,"matter, but Opposition members ought to give",102
NA,"credit to the Government for the fact that, rather",102
NA,than just talking about subversion and leaving it,102
NA,to somebody else to think about that might be,103
NA,"subversive, it has attempted to define it.",103
NA,The Opposition has not offered any other form,103
NA,of words in an effort to come to grips with the,103
NA,sorts of problems mentioned by the honourable,103
NA,member for Lilley. If Opposition members were,103
NA,serious about the matter they would have offered,103
NA,some alternative; they would have considered,103
NA,the difficulties with which we have to deal and,103
NA,would have been prepared to make reasonable,103
NA,offers. The Opposition has had opportunities to,103
NA,"do that. This is the second opportunity it has had,",103
NA,having in mind its caucus method of making de-,103
NA,"cisions, to proffer alternative amendments. The",103
NA,Opposition is giving us the same amendments as,103
NA,have already been debated in another place. It is,103
NA,fixed. It has determined its position. The same,103
NA,amendments are proposed. We would like to see,103
NA,some flexibility. We would like the Opposition to,103
NA,take a different position and be constructive in,103
NA,these matters. We might then be in a better pos-,103
NA,ition to consider alternative propositions. I f the,103
NA,Opposition were genuine it would offer alterna-,103
NA,tives. I suspect that it is not genuine.,103

Dr BLEWETT ,Bonython) (10.24)-We are,103
NA,discussing the third of the definitions of definitions,103
NA,subversion-th e one which I find the most the,103
NA,"suspect of the three. As it stands at the moment,",103
NA,the definition refers to:,103
NA,activities directed to promoting violence or hatred between,103
NA,different groups of persons in the Australian community so,103
NA,"as to endanger the peace, order or good government of the",103
NA,Commonwealth.,103
NA,"We propose, in our amendment, to retain the",103
NA,word 'violence' but to omit the words 'or larly,103
NA,"hatred', partly because we find this perhaps",103
NA,most subjective and difficult of all the definitions,103
NA,"in clause 5(1). With the indulgence of the Chair,",103
NA,I will take as a guiding principle the guidelines,103
NA,provided by the honourable member for Lilley,103
NA,( Mr Kevin Cairns) and the honourable member,103
NA,for Dundas ( Mr Ruddock)-th e 'Lilley-Dundas have.,103
NA,guidelines'-o n how to approach these defini-,103
NA,tional problems. It seems to me that in their argu-,103
NA,ments today they have produced three major,103
NA,guidelines as the basis for rejecting the amendsupervision.,103
NA,ments proposed by the Opposition. One is that,103
NA,the definitions should not be changed because,103
NA,we must allow an exercise of judgment to the,103
NA,Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.,103
NA,Another is that the definitions must not be vision,103
NA,changed because we must trust ASIO. The third,103
NA,is that we should not meddle with definitions;,103
NA,"rather, we should approach them, in the words of",103
NA,"the honourable member for Dundas, with a little",103
NA,caution. I am perfectly happy to take those,103
NA,guidelines on board in discussing this particular,103
NA,amendment. I refer first of all to the claim that,103
NA,we should not interfere with those definitions be-,103
NA,cause we have to allow the ASIO agents an exer-,103
NA,cise of judgment. Let me make quite clear the,103
NA,agents about whom we are talking. The honour-,103
NA,able member for Dundas suggested a moment,103
NA,"ago that all these issues, such as defining which",103
NA,"group was creating hatred, somehow would go to",103
NA,the Director-General. Quite clearly that is a,103
NA,naive approach because time and again the de-,103
NA,"cisions will be made locally by individual agents,",103
NA,"and because the definitions are broad enough, or",103
NA,"wide enough, then the agent can justify his de-",103
NA,"cisions. Indeed, on this exercise of ASIO judg-",103
NA,"ment, even if the Government accepted every",103
NA,"amendment proposed by the Opposition, there",103
NA,still would be enormous room for ASIO to make,103
NA,judgments.,103
NA,What we are arguing on this side is that this,103
NA,Parliament has a responsibility to be as precise as,103
NA,possible in the definition of the functions of,103
NA,"So, even if it accepted all our amend-",103
NA,there still would be a considerable area in,103
NA,which ASIO agents could exercise their judg-,103
NA,ment. The Opposition is saying that it is the re-,103
NA,sponsibility of this Parliament to make these,103
NA,as precise as possible. There is then,103
NA,issue of trusting ASIO. I always thought that,103
NA,it was the conservative parties that had the rather,103
NA,pessimistic view of the nature of man. Here we,103
NA,have a situation in which there is a powerful or-,103
NA,"ganisation with, in the Opposition's view, quite",103
NA,"inadequate supervision. Yet, somehow the",103
NA,Government is now displaying an extraordinary,103
NA,"optimism that we can trust these people, particu-",103
NA,"in this very subjective area, to exercise their",103
NA,the judgment in some completely impartial and per-,103
NA,haps non-political way. All the evidence we have,103
NA,"of these types of secret agencies, both overseas",103
NA,"and in this country, does not give us confidence",103
NA,in trusting such organisations. I suggest that we,103
NA,"must use the track record, the evidence that we",103
NA,I do not believe that we can accept the,103
NA,guidelines offered. We are providing inadequate,103
NA,If we had much wider supervision,103
NA,the Parliament would be capable of giving a,103
NA,greater amount of trust because it could then,103
NA,check on how that trust was being exercised.,103
NA,"However, because there is inadequate super-",103
NA,"provided by this Bill, on the evidence I do",103
NA,not believe that we can trust the ASIO agents,103
NA,with the kinds of extensive powers that they are,103
NA,being given in this definition of their functions. I,103
NA,again refer honourable members to the activities,104
NA,ofthe Central Intelligence Agency and other re-,104
NA,lated secret agencies in the United States. Their,104
NA,activities over the last ten orfifteenyears have,104
NA,shown that they are not the types of organis-,104
NA,ations one can trust. The honourable member for,104
NA,Dundas this afternoon asked why we on this side,104
NA,of the House always talk about the CIA and simi-,104
NA,lar agencies; why did we not talk about the KGB.,104
NA,That seemed to me to be simply a piece of parti-,104
NA,san rhetoric. I have not bothered to consider the,104
NA,KGB in this debate because I believed that the,104
NA,Committee was debating the role of a secret,104
NA,agency or a security agency in a democratic so-,104
NA,"ciety. Therefore, the KGB is not relevant to that",104
NA,"consideration. However, having listened to this",104
NA,"debate all afternoon, I am beginning to suspect",104
NA,that many honourable members on the Govern-,104
NA,ment side do not have a very full or clear ap-,104
NA,"preciation of democratic values. Indeed, if one",104
NA,follows through the implications of some of their,104
NA,"statements, those doubts must grow.",104
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-Di d you get the card back,104
NA,at your pre-selection?,104
Dr BLEWETT, I think that is completely ir-,104
NA,relevant. What I am arguing for is a little caution,104
NA,about these definitions. I think we should be par-,104
NA,ticularly cautious in relation to hatred. There are,104
NA,three reasons for being cautious about the intro-,104
NA,duction of hatred as part ofthe definition of sub-,104
NA,"version. One is that, in a sense, it is novel in that",104

Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (10.31)- I raise a,104
NA,"matter which is of concern to me, which is of con-",104
NA,cern to a number of people in my electorate and,104
NA,which will be of concern to a number of Aus-,104
NA,"tralians. In the Victorian Parliament today, the",104
NA,member for Geelong East raised a matter which,104
NA,reflects on the administration of Commonwealth,104
NA,funds by this Government. He raised the ques-,104
NA,tion of what is apparently a direction from the,104
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) which re-,104
NA,stricts the amount of funds available to universi-,104
NA,ties in Victoria for the expansion of off-campus,104
NA,studies. This is a significant and growing area of,104
NA,education and one which fulfills a very great,104
NA,"need in our society. It is fairly well known,",104
NA,"especially by people in Victoria, that patronage",104
NA,is practised in the distribution of Commonwealth,104
NA,funds to areas of Victoria. I think it is not un-,104
NA,reasonable to suggest that the Prime Minister's,104
NA,electorate receives at least five times as much in,104
NA,State and Commonwealth grants of funds than,104
NA,any other non-metropolitan area in Victoria.,104
NA,What is alarming to me in this instance is that,104
NA,there is clear evidence that this Government has,104
NA,acted to divert funds from an education program,104
NA,which is one of the real successes of the inno-,104
NA,vations in recent years to the Prime Minister's,104
NA,electorate purely for domestic political purposes.,104
NA,People have a right to seek to improve them-,104
NA,selves through tertiary education. Many of the,104
NA,people doing so are people whose basic skills at,104
NA,the completion of their formal education were,104
NA,such that their job opportunities were limited.,104
NA,They are seeking to improve their positions so,104
NA,that they can fulfil an ambition and improve,104
NA,their position in our society. Many of them are,104
NA,adults who have to gain this education off cam-,104
NA,"pus because, quite obviously, they cannot afford",104
NA,to undertake full time education as they have to,104
NA,earn their living. The experience of Deakin Uni-,104
NA,versity is that the rate of passes among mature,104
NA,students studying off-campus courses and the,104
NA,levels at which mature students have been able,104
NA,to undertake part time courses with success are,104
NA,far in excess of the levels expected of students,104
NA,entering university on a full time basis. It is an,104
NA,area of education which is important and which,104
NA,should be maintained. It certainly should not be,104
NA,the subject of political interference on a basis,104
NA,which has nothing to do with the relevant merits,104
NA,of the allocation of funds.,104
NA,This follows a matter which I raised on two,104
NA,occasions last week when my electorate was re-,104
NA,moved from the list of areas entitled to apply for,104
NA,decentralisation funds from the Commonwealth.,104
NA,"On a number of occasions during the week, the",104
NA,Minister for National Development ( Mr New-,104
NA,man) has said that if Labor members in this,104
NA,place represented more electorates they could,104
NA,apply for a greater share of the funds. As a Labor,104
NA,member in this place representing an electorate,104
NA,"which was eligible, I know that it is extremely",104
NA,difficult to comply with that requirement if the,104
NA,Minister uses his authority to remove an elector-,105
NA,"ate from those areas that are eligible to apply,",105
NA,and I think it makes fairly false that sort of sug-,105
NA,gestion. The allocation of funds not only should,105
NA,be done on the basis of merit but also should be,105
NA,"seen to be done on the basis of merit, and all the",105
NA,evidence that has accrued over the last three,105
NA,years is that they are being applied on the basis,105
NA,"of political patronage, without relevance to",105
NA,merit. That is something which this Parliament,105
NA,should not allow.,105
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr M i l l a r ) -,105
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has,105
NA,expired.,105
Mr HYDE ,"Moore) (10.36)-In a democracy,",105
NA,no government can coerce its people; it must lead,105
NA,them. If it is to lead them in a direction that will,105
NA,"be to their ultimate benefit, it must do so with",105
NA,"curate information. Sometimes, political parties",105
NA,"of all colours have an interest in misinformation,",105
NA,and in that context I wish to say something about,105
NA,the 25 per cent tariff cut. The decision taken,105
NA,some time ago by the then Labor Government to,105
NA,cut the tariff has had and will have ramifications,105
NA,for decisions taken by this Government and by,105
NA,future governments. That decision was taken in,105
NA,July 1973 and followed a period during which,105
NA,the nation's reserve assets had been climbing,105
NA,"rapidly. In fact, from a level of $ 1,500m in",105
NA,"December 1970 they had risen to $4,750m by",105
NA,December 1972. This clearly had inflationary,105
NA,"implications for the economy, and the Govern-",105
NA,ment of the day had to do something about those,105
NA,inflationary implications. It had a number of re-,105
NA,valuations and it made the 25 per cent tariff cut,105
NA,"decision, all of which had an impact on the grow-",105
NA,ing level of reserve assets and the upward press-,105
NA,ure on the Australian dollar.,105
NA,The 25 per cent tariff cut was equivalent to a,105
NA,revaluation of about 4 per cent in terms of the,105
NA,effect that it had on the gross operating surplus. I,105
NA,invite those honourable members opposite who,105
NA,are attempting to distract me not to panic. The,105
NA,appreciations undertaken by the Government,105
NA,over that time were in the order of 20 per cent.,105
NA,The effect of the 25 per cent tariff cut on the,105
NA,operating surplus was relatively minor compared,105
NA,"with the effect of the revaluations; but, in any",105
NA,"case, the cut was made in lieu of a further revalu-",105
NA,ation and there was a revaluation at a later date.,105
NA,"Even in the tariff-affected industries, the revalu-",105
NA,ations had something of the order of three times,105
NA,"the effect of the tariff cut, but the wage rises of",105
NA,that time had an even greater elTect on the pro-,105
NA,fitability of those industries than either the re-,105
NA,valuations or the 25 per cent tariff cut. The tariff,105
NA,cut was equivalent to a wage rise of between 6,105
NA,"per cent and 13 per cent, depending on how one",105
NA,"worked it out. But, in the textile and clothing in-",105
NA,"dustries, from December 1972 to September",105
NA,1974 wages rose by an average of no less than 60,105
NA,per cent-5 6 per cent for males and 73 per cent,105
NA,for females.,105
NA,"I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is",105
NA,foolish in the light of that information to suggest,105
NA,that the 25 per cent tariff cut was the cause ofthe,105
NA,unemployment that was apparent in the years,105
NA,immediately following that decision. The unem-,105
NA,ployment was caused partly by the mismanage-,105
NA,ment of the money supply so that inflation blew,105
NA,"out but, above all, it was caused by the excessive",105
NA,wage rises. The Australian economy is recover-,105
NA,ing. We have capital inflow. This is very,105
NA,beneficial to us. We have become far more com-,105
NA,ac- petitive on the overseas markets. Those are good,105
NA,"things. But the Australian dollar, if we manage to",105
NA,"achieve a continuation of those effects, will have",105
NA,an upward pressure. We will have to look again,105
NA,at whether we will increase imports by reducing,105
NA,protection for the import competing industries or,105
NA,whether we will merely upvalue the dollar. It,105
NA,would be pity if these decisions were taken in the,105
NA,light of misinformation instead of accurate,105
NA,information.,105
Mr BARRY JONES ,Lalor) (10.41 )-In 1900,105
NA,Albert Ellis of the Pacific Islands Company per-,105
NA,suaded two Banabans to place their marks on a,105
NA,paper conceding to the company sole rights to,105
NA,Ocean Island-Banaba-phosphat e for 999 years,105
NA,for the payment of £50 per annum. He raised the,105
NA,"Union Jack, and Banaba was annexed to the",105
NA,Empire. Such was the inspiration of membership,105
NA,of the Empire that in 1916 all 500 Banabans,105
NA,"donated £10,000 worth of copra to the war",105
NA,effort. Britain repaid this by making Banaba part,105
NA,"of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony, without",105
NA,informing or consulting the people. In 1927,105
NA,Australia and New Zealand joined with Britain,105
NA,in the British Phosphate Commission and asked,105
NA,the Banabans for more land to mine for phos-,105
NA,"phate, but the Banabans refused. In 1928 the col-",105
NA,onial administradon forced the signing of leases,105
NA,gross on the threat that the land would be taken any-,105
NA,"way for the empire, and their villages destroyed.",105
NA,Continued refusal led to the land being compul-,105
NA,sorily purchased by the colony they did not ask,105
NA,to join.,105
NA,Amazingly the Banabans loyally donated,105
NA,"£512,500 to British war funds in 1940. This was",105
NA,rewarded by the British abandoning them to the,105
NA,"Japanese, who deponed the majority as slave",105
NA,"labour, and shot the 150 remaining, except for",105
NA,"one survivor. In 1945, they asked to be allowed",105
NA,"to return to their home, but were told this was",105
NA,"impossible because of war damage, and were re-",106
NA,"moved 1,400 miles away to Rabi in the Fiji",106
NA,"islands. Within weeks of their arrival on Rabi,",106
NA,the BPC was recruiting Gilbertese to work on the,106
NA,phosphate and providing them with accommo-,106
NA,dation. In 1947 loyalty prompted the Banabans,106
NA,on Rabi to donate £500 to each of the cities of,106
NA,Plymouth and Portsmouth for post-war recon-,106
NA,"struction, while Britain, through its Western",106
NA,"Pacific High Commission, instructed the",106
NA,"Banaban adviser, who was paid by the",106
NA,"Banabans, not to advise them on the sale of the",106
NA,remaining three-fifths of their phosphate land.,106
NA,Only in 1965 did they realise they had been,106
NA,"cheated, and they expelled the British colonial",106
NA,"service officer appointed to Rabi, who was",106
NA,known as the Banaban adviser. In 1967 they sent,106
NA,"a mission to London, where the Minister asked",106
NA,"them to sign a minute accepting £80,000 as an ex",106
NA,gratia payment in consideration of the effects of,106
NA,phosphate mining since 1900. At long last they,106
NA,refused on legal advice. In 1975 their case went,106
NA,to court. They won against the BPC but not,106
NA,against the Crown. The judge in his judgment,106
NA,described the behaviour of colonial government,106
NA,as outrageous and bullying. Nonetheless the,106
NA,"damages awarded were a trifling £9,000.",106
NA,The total revenue from Banaban phosphates,106
NA,which will have been used by the end of mining,106
NA,this year to meet Britain's obligations in the Gil-,106
NA,bert Islands colony is £62m and the subsidies,106
NA,over the years to Australian and New Zealand,106
NA,farmers a further £ 17.5m. The Banabans have,106
NA,been offered $A10m by the British Government,106
NA,and $AI.25m by the British Phosphate Com-,106
NA,"mission provided they take no more legal action,",106
NA,but this has been made conditional on the money,106
NA,"being tied up in a trust fund, which they do not",106
NA,want. But Britain may waive this condition. This,106
NA,would leave only the moral and political issues to,106
NA,"be resolved. At present, of course, Britain is still",106
NA,continuing with the process that it has adopted of,106
NA,forcing the Banabans to accept becoming part of,106
NA,"the newly independent Republic of Kiribati,",106
NA,which covers the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. As,106
NA,the Banabans will for sometimebe in the unique,106
NA,"situation of having two homelands 1,400 miles",106
NA,apart-Banab a and Rabi-th e course which,106
NA,would recognise the uniqueness of their case,106
NA,would be to allow for the separation of Ocean,106
NA,"Island from the Gilbert group, leaving the",106
NA,Banabans to negotiate a form of association with,106
NA,"Fiji, covering the relationships of the two islands.",106
NA,It seems sensible that they should have the same,106
NA,defence force and an external affairs minister in,106
NA,Suva.,106
NA,Australia has been the primary beneficiary of,106
NA,the exploitation of the Banabans. I think it is one,106
NA,"of the most disgraceful, most horrifying stories.",106
NA,Australia and New Zealand have benefited far,106
NA,"more than Great Britain from the exploitation,",106
NA,despoliation and destruction of these islands. I,106
NA,believe that we have a strong moral imperative,106
NA,to do something and to make sure that the com-,106
NA,pensation is handed over and that the compensa-,106
NA,tion is more generous.,106
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MILLAR -,106
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has,106
NA,expired.,106
Mr KEVIN CAIRNS ,Lilley) (10.46)-My re-,106
NA,marks are related to certain events in,106
NA,Queensland. They are related to the circum-,106
NA,stances surrounding the next Senate election for,106
NA,that State. Not since 1943 has the Australian,106
NA,Labor Party won the Senate in Queensland. It,106
NA,has quite clearly been the most successful State in,106
NA,Australia for the Liberal and Country parties or,106
NA,the Liberal and the National Country parties in,106
NA,the Senate. I will relate two instances. At the,106
NA,double dissolutions of 1974 and 1975 six out of,106
NA,10 coalition senators were returned for,106
NA,Queensland. It is known that the parties,106
NA,achieved similar success at the double dissol-,106
NA,"ution in 1951. Therefore, the parties have been",106
NA,magnificently successful. They have had,106
NA,unparalleled success. The joint team has enjoyed,106
NA,that success. The plain fact is that the success has,106
NA,"not been emulated by any other State. Why,",106
NA,"then, should a change be proposed? Various",106
NA,reasons have been given. Let me have at least the,106
NA,right or the freedom to put a point of view other,106
NA,than that which is generally put.,106
NA,Why should I show concern? Three issues,106
NA,have been indicated as being the negotiating,106
NA,points for the proposal for a joint Senate team in,106
NA,Queensland. I say how false it is and what non-,106
NA,sense it is to propose these three issues. They are,106
NA,three issues that occur at a State level. What,106
NA,party in Australia would be induced to take,106
NA,action at a federal level for a trinity of State,106
NA,issues. Let me recite them to the House quickly.,106
NA,The three State issues are: In Queensland there is,106
NA,"no public accounts committee, there are certain",106
NA,amendments to redistributions and certain pro-,106
NA,posals to Acts concerning street marches. There-,106
NA,fore it is proposed that action should be taken at,106
NA,a federal level in terms of a joint Senate team.,106
NA,Not one vote in the Federal Parliament can,106
NA,influence these issues. Were a thousand senators,106
NA,or members to be elected to this Parliament they,106
NA,could have no influence whatsoever. As a Fed-,106
NA,"eral member in this place, let me say that that",106
NA,process and that argument have to be total non-,107
NA,sense. I do not use any stronger word. I am aware,107
NA,when I say this that Federal endorsements in my,107
NA,own State have been held up. Nevertheless what,107
NA,must be said must be said because the issues,107
NA,have been touted in the public domain. Honesty,107
NA,demands that it be said. I also share the concern,107
NA,of the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) at,107
NA,the consequences of actions proposed with re-,107
NA,spect to Senate elections. Prairie fires-lik e,107
NA,erysipelas-ar e not readily contained; nor will I,107
NA,believe that such disputes will be contained,107
NA,within State boundaries given the strong per-,107
NA,"sonalities involved. Some claim, for example,",107
NA,that recent by-elections in Queensland give the,107
NA,green light for any action whatsoever. The,107
NA,"Redcliffe by-election, on any serious analysis,",107
NA,certainly does not. I cannot share the exultation,107
NA,that has obviously engulfed others with respect,107
NA,to those events.,107
NA,It is a very great honour to be given the,107
NA,ority to be a public representative. That honour,107
NA,should not be frittered away. One's aim ultimamy,107
NA,tely has to be to serve the common good. To,107
NA,"so one needs colleagues and partners, and one",107
NA,needs continuing colleagues and partners. One,107
NA,must remember above all that the Australian,107
NA,Labor Party is the alternative government. It,107
NA,our competitor and it is the organisation that is,107
NA,poised best to benefit from unnecessary conflict.,107
NA,To turn away from that knowledge could be,107
NA,"astrous and, I believe, could be foolish beyond",107
NA,the wildest fear.,107
Mr LEO MCLEAY ,Grayndler) (10.50)-On,107
NA,Saturday afternoon the eyes of eastern Australia,107
NA,will be on one of the local institutions in my,107
NA,torate. On Saturday afternoon the Canterburyclub,107
NA,Bankstown Rugby League Club will be facing,107
NA,the first grand final it will be successful in since Wales.,107
NA,1949. A number of members of Parliament may,107
NA,think that that is a rather mundane thing to,107
NA,"speak about in the adjournment debate, but Country",107
NA,"Canterbury-Bankstown Club is a club that, of all",107
NA,football clubs including those in other States of,107
NA,"Australia, is a local club. It is a club that has",107
NA,spent much time developing local juniors and,107
NA,plays district football at its best. Maybe some of,107
NA,the honourable members from Queensland only,107
NA,want to talk about Rugby Union.,107
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,107
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Millar)- of certain,107
NA,Order! There are too many members on my right,107
NA,offside.,107
Mr LEO MCLEAY,Canterbury-Bankstow n posal,107
NA,last won the grand final in 1942. Since then that,107
NA,club has come very close to winning it again,107
NA,1967 and will defeat St George on Saturday. I,107
NA,am pleased to see that the honourable member,107
NA,for St George ( Mr Neil) has come into the,107
NA,chamber to listen to this debate. There are a few,107
NA,political lessons in this for him on Saturday too.,107
NA,There are a few lessons I hope that he will ap-,107
NA,preciate in it. The point is that Canterbury-,107
NA,Bankstown has been a club that has always given,107
NA,of its time and effort to the people of the area,107
NA,from which they get their members. My prede-,107
NA,cessor Frank Stewart and his brother Kevin were,107
NA,"both patrons of the club. Kevin Ryan, arguably",107
NA,one of the best football players in Australia's his-,107
NA,"tory, was captain-coach of the club. I might say",107
NA,he was also a very realistic fellow in that he is,107
NA,also one of the prominent Labor parliamen-,107
NA,tarians in New South Wales.,107
NA,The club has always adopted an attitude of,107
NA,helping the locals. When the team wins on,107
NA,Saturday it will be a victory for the battlers. Need,107
NA,authI say that at this time when the Government is,107
NA,crushing the battlers it is nice to see a team from,107
NA,electorate do its bit for the working people of,107
NA,do Australia. Canterbury-Bankstown has been a,107
NA,club which has always provided bursaries for its,107
NA,"local players. In fact, George Peponis is one of",107
NA,the great representatives of that club and a man,107
NA,is who has been nurtured by the club and has gone,107
NA,"on to do well as a doctor. In fact, he is a man who",107
NA,"is an excellent representative of the area, very",107
NA,dismuch a man of Canterbury-Bankstown and very,107
NA,much a man of Grayndler. I think it would be re-,107
NA,miss of me if I did not stand here in this Parlia-,107
NA,ment this evening and offer that team my best,107
NA,"wishes and, I hope, the best wishes of the Parlia-",107
NA,elecment so that it will go on to bring glory to the,107
NA,"and, might I say, glory to the working",107
NA,"people, the battlers of Sydney and New South",107
Mr COTTER ,Kalgoorlie) (10.54)- I rise to-,107
NA,night to make a personal appeal to Liberal and,107
NA,parties in Queensland. I do this as a rep-,107
NA,resentative of another State. I appeal to the Lib-,107
NA,eral Party to reconsider the situation in which it,107
NA,might run separate Senate tickets in that State. I,107
NA,have strong feelings on this matter and I recog-,107
NA,nise that there are shortcomings in both parties. I,107
NA,recognise that we will not see all matters in the,107
NA,same light all of the time. I am aware of certain,107
NA,frustrations which are felt by the Liberals in,107
NA,Queensland. I recognise the political ambitions,107
NA,people. I am aware that certain de-,107
NA,cisions were made at the last State conference of,107
NA,the Liberal Party some time ago. But the pro-,107
NA,to run separate tickets in Queensland is,107
NA,political suicide. This question is bigger than the,107
NA,"in Senate candidates concerned, bigger than the",107
NA,"frustrations and ambitions of some people, and",108
NA,bigger than the State of Queensland and the Lib-,108
NA,eral Party. The action will place at real risk the,108
NA,solidarity of the non-Labor vote in this country.,108
NA,Despite the assurances of the Prime Minister,108
NA,( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime,108
NA,Minister ( Mr Anthony) it will place unnatural,108
NA,and unnecesary stresses on the coalition of the,108
NA,great free enterprise forces of this nation. The,108
NA,great free enterprise governments that have been,108
NA,the bulwark of development and progress have,108
NA,set this great country apart in the eyes of the,108
NA,world. Under the coalition Government,108
NA,Australia has emerged a a world leader. It is,108
NA,respected in the Western world. We have proved,108
NA,we can control inflation against world trends and,108
NA,can continue to develop. We have a strong econ-,108
NA,omy and are looked on as a stable and honest,108
NA,government. This has not happened by accident.,108
NA,It has been brought about by careful co-,108
NA,operation between people with a common goal.,108
NA,If the Liberals of Queensland are dissatisfied,108
NA,with the National Party Government there- I,108
NA,make no comment on that-the y should turn,108
NA,their attention to winning State seats in,108
NA,Queensland. If they are successful they can look,108
NA,at the coalition Government in Canberra.,108
NA,I appeal to the Queensland President of the,108
NA,"Liberal Party, whom I have known and",108
NA,"respected for some years, to reconsider the situ-",108
NA,ation and to move cautiously on the question of,108
NA,"Senatetickets.I am sure that, given good faith, a",108
NA,satisfactory compromise can be worked out. If,108
NA,the intention to run separate Senateticketsin,108
NA,"Queensland is carried through, the repercussions",108
NA,cannot be quarantined in Queensland. The,108
NA,effects will flow on to all States of this nation,108
NA,could be felt by the coalition Government here in,108
NA,Canberra. We should not forget the terrible,108
NA,effect that the Whitlam Labor Government had,108
NA,on this country in its three years of dark govern-,108
NA,"ment. We must not forget that, following the",108
NA,"Adelaide Conference of the Labor Party, it is",108
NA,now clear that the Labor Party's policies have,108
NA,not changed. They are more socialist than ever.,108
NA,"They may be dressed up differently, but they are",108
NA,just as socialist as ever.,108
NA,"To keep a strong, honest government in Cannot",108
NA,berra means maintaining a strong coalition,108
NA,"Canberra, with a strong sense of friendship and",108
NA,co-operation. I ask the Queensland Liberals and,108
NA,the Queensland National Party to lift their sights,108
NA,to national horizons. There are methods of gaindo,108
NA,ing the ideals and goals which they are setting,108
NA,out to achieve. But they will not be achieved by,108
NA,the parties running separate Senate tickets.,108
NA,again appeal to those people in that State to,108
NA,think again on the course on which they are,108
NA,directed at present; to move with extreme cau-,108
NA,tion; and to keep in mind at alltimesthe great,108
NA,"goal of this nation, Australia, and the way in",108
NA,which we will go under an honest coalition,108
NA,government.,108
Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (10.57)-Having,108
NA,heard what the honourable member for,108
NA,Kalgoorlie ( Mr Cotter) and the honourable,108
NA,"member for Lilley ( Mr Kevin Cairns) said, 1",108
NA,think it is only fair to say to this House that their,108
NA,pleas for the Liberal Party of Australia in,108
NA,"Queensland, for instance, to give up its expec-",108
NA,tations of governing that State is a noble gesture,108
NA,made by honourable members who are not,108
NA,required to live in a State governed by the,108
NA,National Party. The facts of the situation are,108
NA,"that, if the Liberal Party does not contest seats",108
NA,held by the National Party in Queensland it can-,108
NA,not change the relationship of the parties within,108
NA,the coalition Government of that State so that it,108
NA,is the partner with the majority. If that is the situ-,108
NA,ation which honourable members opposite who,108
NA,have spoken in this adjournment debate are sug-,108
NA,"gesting should apply, one wonders why the",108
NA,Liberal Party should bother even to run in an,108
NA,election in that State. I would have thought that a,108
NA,party which once had self-respect and had,108
NA,shown at least a recovery of some of that self-,108
NA,respect in that State would object to being a,108
NA,party to some of the actions which currently are,108
NA,being taken in Queensland. It is not unreason-,108
NA,able to suggest in this Parliament that there is a,108
NA,strong case for holding an inquiry into whether,108
NA,people in that State have even basic civil rights.,108
NA,Some people have more rights than others.,108
NA,and People who live in Queensland are Australians.,108
NA,The people I happen to be talking about are a re-,108
NA,sponsibility of this Parliament. They are people,108
NA,"who, on the basis of race, are denied the rights",108
NA,enjoyed by other people.,108
NA,The facts are that the honourable member for,108
NA,Kalgoorlie said in this House that the people of,108
NA,Queensland should not have the opportunity to,108
NA,elect a government other than one under the,108
NA,present Premier; that the Liberal Party should,108
NA,accept a political responsibility to seek to be-,108
NA,in come the majority party in a coalition govern-,108
NA,"ment, in line with the support it has in that State;",108
NA,and that the Liberal Party should forgo the op-,108
NA,portunity to provide the Premier of that State. 1,108
NA,not think that the Liberal Party would ad-,108
NA,"equately govern that State either, but it would",108
NA,have to be preferable to what we have at present.,108
NA,I If people in Queensland are denied the oppor-,108
NA,"tunity to support the Liberal Party, we will see",108
NA,"political opportunists, for base political reasons,",109
NA,denying people their civil rights.,109

NA,(1) Were visas to visit the United States refused to Mr,118

NA,(2) Is he able to say whether this reversal of a,118

NA,national support for removal of discrimination or for com-,118
NA,pensation for dispossession of indigenes by later settlers in,118
NA,Australia and (b) an Aboriginal subject to refusal of a visa,118
NA,on account of unsubstantiated political objections raised by a,118
NA,"State Government, but not applied in the case of",118
NA,non-Aborigines.,118
NA,NA,118
NA,member's question is as follows:,118
NA,Neither I nor my Department had any knowledge of any,118
NA,NA,118
NA,obtaining visas to enter the United States of America.,118
NA,The only information on this matter which has been,118
NA,revealed by inquiries by my Department is contained in a re-,118
NA,port in the NQ Message Stick of July 1979. We have no in-,118
NA,formation to suggest that speculations made in that report,118
NA,are correct.,118
NA,The matter of visa issue for entry to United States of,118
NA,America is entirely a matter for the US authorities and the,118

NA,Aboriginal Housing,118
NA,Dr Everingham asked the Minister represent-,118
NA,"ing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon",118
NA,"notice, on 22 August 1979:",118
NA,(1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the book A,118
NA,Black Reality: Aboriginal Camps and Housing in Remote,118
NA,"Australia, which has a dozen contributors and which was",118
NA,"edited by Dr Michael Heppell, who was recently dismissed",118
NA,by the Government from the Aboriginal Housing Panel.,118
NA,"(2) If so, does the book argue that Government planners",118
NA,are arrogant and that the Prime Minister has increased,118
NA,bureaucratisation in providing Aboriginal housing by mak-,118
NA,ing the Department of Housing and Construction respon-,118
NA,sible for all remote Aboriginal housing programs.,118
NA,(3) Does the book also state that increased drunkenness,118
NA,"and violence has resulted from the construction of $40,000",118
NA,houses in remote Arnhem Land and that there is a better ac-,118
NA,"ceptance of free palm thatched houses than of $45,000 ones",118
NA,"being constructed in North Queensland; if so, is there evi-",118

NA,ies being inadequately housed,118
NA,ommendations of every Government investigation into Ab-,118
NA,original housing and all related problems and in breach of,118
NA,election undertakings of the Government.,118
NA,(5) Does the book concur with these investigations and,118
NA,policy in insisting that constant and sympathetic contact with,118
NA,Aborigines is required to prevent squandering of funds on,118
NA,the European-devised programs now entrusted to officials,118
NA,"with little opportunity to achieve such contact: if so, is any",118
NA,action being taken to correct the position.,118
NA,(Question No. 4454),118
Mr VINER ,Th e Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,118
NA,has provided the following answer to the,118
NA,honourable member's question:,118
NA,(1) 1 have seen the book A Black Reality: Aboriginal,118
NA,Camps and Housing in Remote Australia edited by Dr M.,118
NA,Heppell andrecentlypublished by the Australian Institute of,118
NA,Aboriginal Studies. The Government did not dismiss Dr,118
NA,decision was Heppell from the Aboriginal Housing Panel.,118
NA,(2) I note that Dr H. C. Coombs in a Foreword to the book,118
NA,comments on the disappointing results of Government hous-,118
NA,"ing policies for Aboriginals over the years and, acknowledg-",118
NA,ing that he is 'one who must bear some responsibility for this,118
NA,failure' refers to 'our haste (and our arrogance)' in relation,118
NA,to the housing of Aboriginals. I have not found any reference,118
NA,"to the Prime Minister, or to 'increased bureaucratisation' by",118
NA,Dr Heppell nor does he indicate that the Department of,118
NA,Housing and Construction has been made 'responsible for,118
NA,all remote Aboriginal housing problems'. He does indicate at,118
NA,page 42 that the Government requires 'the Department of,118
NA,"Construction to act, wherever practicable, as consultant to",118
NA,Aboriginal Housing Associations'.,118
NA,(3) 1 have found no statement that 'increased drunkenness,118
NA,"and violence has resulted from the construction of $40,000",118
NA,"houses in remote Arnhem Land', in either of the two papers",118
NA,in the book which deal with communities in Arnhem Land.,118
NA,In a paper on housing at Mitchell River and Edward River in,118
NA,"North Queensland, Dr Taylor sets out the evidence for his",118
NA,view that 'the thatched houses and shanties of the earlier,118
NA,days' were closer to being entities 'firmly linked to peoples',118
NA,"needs, abilities, ambitions and expressive drives' than 'the",118
NA,present day prefabricated housing'.,118
NA,(4) and (5) Expenditure to date on Aboriginal housing by,118
NA,Governments throughout Australia has been inadequate to,118
NA,meet the needs and both Commonwealth and State Govern-,118
NA,ments haverecognisedthis. The greatly increased provision,118
NA,(Question No. 4458) for Aboriginal housing in the 1979-80 Commonwealth,118
NA,Budget should enable a substantial reduction to be made in,118
NA,the housing shortage.,118
NA,The papers in this book provide a useful reminder ofthe,118
NA,complexity of the problems Aboriginal communities and,118
NA,governments face in improving housing conditions in the re-,118
NA,mote areas where tradition-oriented Aboriginals live and,118
NA,they deserve serious study by all concerned.,118

NA,December 1977. I do not know what stage ofthe criminal,118

NA,(1) The Department adopts a multi-disciplinary approach,119

NA,benefit to that largely treeless island.,120
NA,NA,120
NA,member's question is as follows:,120
NA,"The suggestion that, as a gesture of goodwill, Australia",120
NA,might consider providing appropriate trees for planting in,120

NA,(2) If the United States of America was satisfied with in-,120

NA,clear weapon and the resultant decision was the complete,120
NA,"abandonment of aid, will Australia take similar action; if",120

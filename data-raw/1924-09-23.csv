Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [3.131 -,15
NA,"When the House adjourned on ""Friday",15
NA,last I was discussing the manner in,15
NA,which the output of butter could be in-,15
NA,creased so that the dairying industry-,15
NA,might be more profitable to those engaged,15
NA,ii - it. Most people who know anything,15
NA,of this industry realize that many have,15
NA,made a success of it. That success has,15
NA,'been possible because they have obtained,15
NA,"their land at reasonable prices, and have",15
NA,had sufficient capital to install good work-,15
NA,ing plants and purchase first-class herds;,15
NA,while their land has been cleared and well,15
NA,laid down with grasses.,15
NA,NA,15
NA,cessful only because of the help of the,15
NA,"members of their own family, who have",15
NA,not been paid.,15
NA,"Mr FENTON"" -W e should not judge",15
NA,an industry by the record of one or two,15
NA,years only. A number of dairymen have,15
NA,for many years conducted their industry,15
NA,on a profitable basis. I realize that from,15
NA,time to time assistance has been granted,15
NA,"to farmers and others on the land, not only",15
NA,"by this Parliament, but by the Parlia-",15
NA,ments of the states. We on this side have,15
NA,not hesitated to record votes for the,15
NA,amelioration of the conditions of the,15
NA,primary producers. We recognize that,15
NA,dairymen to-day are experiencing very,15
NA,"difficult times, and that it is necessary to",15
NA,grant them some assistance. I n consider-,15
NA,ing what the nature of that assistance,15
NA,"should be, we should have in view the",15
NA,PAPERS. permanent good of the dairying industry.,15
Mr GREGORY ,I s not the present un-,15
NA,satisfactory state of affairs due more to,15
NA,the high cost of production than to the,15
NA,Dated 17th low price of butter?,15
Mr FENTON ,I n speaking of the,15
NA,"high cost of production, the honorable",15
NA,"member may refer only to high wages,",15
NA,or he may have in mind the high cost of,15
NA,"machinery and implements. Personally,",15
NA,I think that the present trouble is largely,15
NA,due to the excessive prices paid for tbe,15
NA,land in many instances.,15
Mr GREGORY ,"Land , like other things,",15
NA,has a fictitious value to-day.,15
Mr FENTON ,I n considering the,15
NA,cost of production we must have regard,15
NA,not only to the cost of labour and of,15
NA,"machinery, but also to the price paid for",15
NA,"land, cattle, and other things. We",15
NA,know that exorbitant prices were paid for,15
NA,tlie land and the cattle purchased for,15
NA,many of our returned soldiers. For that,15
NA,reason many of these men arc in diffi-,15
NA,culties to-day. Unless this bill i3 con-,15
NA,"siderably altered in committee, i t will",15
NA,not be of benefit to the dairymen. Of,15
NA,"what use will an Australian committee,",15
NA,"or a London committee, be? The dairy-",15
NA,ing industry has been represented in Lon-,15
NA,"don for a number of years, but very little",15
NA,benefit has resulted from that representa-,15
NA,"tion. A great deal may, however, be",15
NA,done in Australia. I f returned soldiers,15
NA,and others have been required to pay too,15
NA,"much for their land, this Parliament will",15
NA,probably have to reduce the loan in-,15
NA,"debtedness of the states, and the. states",15
NA,will have to write down the value of their,15
NA,properties. Something of that nature,15
NA,will have to be done. I f the competi-,15
NA,tion which is met with in London isto,15
NA,"be successfully combated, a capital of be-",15
NA,"tween £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 will be",15
NA,required. We sometimes hear talk of,15
NA,"Tooley-street, and of the blending",15
NA,of Australian butter with other but-,15
NA,"ters, and even with other materials.",15
NA,"Mr O'Callaghan, ex-chief dairy expert",15
NA,"of the Commonwealth, who has just re-",15
NA,"turned from Great Britain, tells us what",15
NA,"most of us already knew, that",16
NA,butter' isnot sold as such on the British,16
NA,market. He tells us that the only occa-,16
NA,sion on which our butter has had a fair,16
NA,"'-' spin"" and been sold', aa",16
NA,butter is during the,16
NA,the Wembley Exhibition..,16
NA,leged! few in Great Britain may con-,16
NA,sume our butter knowing that itis,16
NA,"Australian butter, but by far the greater",16
NA,portion of it is not soid asAustralian,16
NA,butter. An honorablemember,16
NA,on Friday last wasmost indiscreet in. his,16
NA,references to our own produce.,16
NA,"all apt to make slips, but if there isi any-",16
NA,thing wrong with Australian,16
NA,which has to compete with that of other,16
NA,"parts of the world, we should take steps",16
NA,to remedy the defect without,16
NA,it forth to the whole world. In Denmark,16
NA,and other countries those who are doing,16
NA,"something which, may be injurious tothe",16
NA,dairying industry are dealt within avery,16
NA,drastic fashion if they do not mend their,16
NA,"ways, but nothing is broadcast",16
NA,advantage of the competitors,16
NA,countries. Honorable members,16
NA,bear in mind that every utterance of,16
NA,theirs condemnatory of Australia's,16
NA,ducts is forwarded by interested,16
NA,"to London, where it is made useof by",16
NA,Australia's-- competitors-. Extracts,16
NA,honorable members' speeches are very de-,16
NA,sirable titbits which can be usedtothe,16
NA,'disadvantage of the Australian,16
NA,industry. One honorable member,16
NA,tioned a defect in Victorian,16
NA,Other honorable members could retaliate,16
NA,by pointing .to defects in butter produced,16
NA,iii other states; but that is not the con-,16
NA,"duct, one would expect in an",16
NA,Parliament. We know that there are,16
NA,"defects in our butter,, but instead of",16
NA,"broadcasting the fact to the world, we",16
NA,should make every endeavour to remedy,16
NA,them. According to Mr.,16
NA,"50 per cent, of Australian butter landed",16
NA,in Great Britain goesinto the blending,16
NA,"shops, ancf is mixed up with other butters,",16
NA,and even with other materials.,16
NA,operations of the blender may benefit the,16
NA,"dairying industry in some directions.,, but",16
NA,that he has done a great deal of harm I,16
NA,know as the result of certain,16
NA,tions I made some years ago. Quite a,16
NA,number of commodities have been added,16
NA,to Australian butter. The chemist is,16
NA,able to blend butter with other,16
NA,.and putup. a very palatable,16
NA,"However, when Australian",16
NA,Great Britain goes to the blender its iden-,16
NA,J/'r. Fenton.,16
NA,Australian t i t y is destroyed. I t goes out to the pub-,16
NA,"lic, not under the brand' of one of our",16
NA,"first class factories, but. under the brands",16
NA,established by the blending people them-,16
NA,"Australian selves, or made use of by the multiple",16
NA,"holding- of shops, or the Maypole Dairy Company.",16
Mr FOSTER ,I t is not then sold as,16
NA,Australian butter?,16
NA,"Mr FENTON"" - No. Except, at",16
NA,"the Wembley Exhibition, Australian",16
NA,speaking but-ter has not been sold as such,16
NA,on the London market. Some of the,16
NA,We are Tooley-street dealers may have taken,16
NA,"Australian, butter to their own homes,",16
NA,"produce and a few of their privileged friends, may",16
NA,have consumed our product knowing i t,16
NA,to be Australian butter.,16
Mr FOSTER , I t would be more correct,16
NA,for the honorable member to say that the,16
NA,"greater proportion of Australian, buttei",16
NA,landed i n Great Britain is not sold ss,16
NA,"Australian, butter.",16
Mr FENTON ,W e are told by Mr .,16
NA,"to the O'Callaghan that 50 per cent, of i t goes",16
NA,"of those into the blending establishments, where",16
NA,"should its identity is immediately destroyed, and",16
NA,thehonorable member knows that Aus-,16
NA,"protralian butter has been sold as "" French",16
NA,"parties rolls,"" and under other names foreign to",16
NA,Australia.,16
Mr FOSTER ,W e have known that,16
NA,for many years.,16
NA,"Mr 'FENTON --Yes , i t has been",16
NA,dairying known to Australians for at least twenty,16
NA,men- years. Mr O'Callaghan puts theposi-,16
NA,butter. tion very plainly. Hesays--,16
NA,No one retails Australian butter to-day; so,16
NA,"far as I know, in fhe name of Australia.",16
NA,"I t is bought by the wholesale man, mani-",16
NA,"Australian pulated by him, and' then sent out t o the",16
NA,"British, public. Mr O'Callaghan also",16
NA,says-,16
NA,I approached some of thebigmultiple shop,16
NA,people about the possibility of sellingAus-,16
NA,"O'Callaghan, tralian butter labelled Australian . . . .",16
NA,They would not entertain the idea.,16
NA,Mr O'Callaghan made several suggestions,16
NA,"to different people, but they would not",16
NA,"The entertain them, because the. blenders,",16
NA,"who own a large number of retail, shops,",16
NA,place their own brands on the butter,16
NA,they sell; not only on that received from,16
NA,"investiga- Australia, but also on that which comes",16
NA,"to London from other, countries. The",16
NA,"butters, when mixed with, other materials,",16
NA,go out to the British public under the,16
NA,"materials, blenders' brand's. The Maypole Dairy",16
NA,article. Company is' a company about which Aus-,16
NA,butter in tralians heard a great deal some years ago.,16
NA,I t is established a few miles f r o m Lon-,16
NA,"don, and I understand that i t has very",16
NA,"few cows, yet i t is able to dispose cf",17
NA,"hundreds, o f tonsof butter a week.",17
Mr R GREEN ,I t is the,17
NA,that produced margarine during the war..,17
Mr FENTON , I am not dealingwith,17
NA,"that part of the company's operations,",17
NA,but no doubt the modern chemist has suc-,17
NA,ceeded i n producingmost excellent mar-,17
NA,garine. T find i n a recent issue of the,17

NA,"Finance,"" the following-",17
NA,Paarbieulars of the fusion of interests be-,17
NA,tween H'orae: and Colonial Stores Limited and,17
NA,MaypoleDairy Company Limited were received,17
NA,by ' the English 'mail! yesterday. The former,17
NA,company has acquired a substantial interest in,17
NA,thei latter. The directors of tho Home and,17
NA,Colonial Stores Limited decided to issue,17
NA,"250,000 ordinary shares of £ 1 at 30s. premium.",17
NA,The companv has an authorized capital of,17
NA,"£2,400.000, of which £.1,800,000 has been issued",17
NA,in addition to. the shares now offered to holders.,17

NA,"trading profit, mainly owing to the continued",17

NA,margin of profit obtain aible on the specialty,17

NA,These two companies have a capital of,17

NA,the firms opposed to us are perhaps a,17
NA,"century old, and through the years they",17
NA,have made their finances' so strong that,17
NA,the proposed London committee would,17
NA,be insignificant and futile. Labour mem-,17

Mr MACKAY , T h e b i l l aims at cutting,17

Mr FENTON , H o w w i l l that be,17

Mr MACKAY , T h e i r proposal involved,17

Mr FENTON ," Y e s , and that would",17
NA,have required the consent of the state,17

Mr R GREEN ,An d i f the sixth state,17

Mr FENTON , N e w Soutli Wales,18
NA,would surely. Lave done the right thing i f,18
NA,the other states were i n agreement.,18
NA,do not think that any state would have,18
NA,stood aloof f r o m the proposal. The Com-,18
NA,monwealth Government should have,18
NA,adopted the scheme propounded by the,18
NA,"dairymen themselves, because we cannot",18
NA,do anything effective without interstate,18
NA,regulation of the industry.,18
NA,NA,18
NA,could be carried out under my plan.,18
Mr FENTON , T h e honorable mem-,18
NA,ber's plan is merely a devious way of,18
NA,fixing prices.,18
NA,NA,18
NA,the fixation of prices.,18
Mr FENTON , I f prices are to be,18
NA,"fixed, let i t be done straightforwardly,",18
NA,and the consumers will consent to i t . Mr .,18
NA,"T. Johnston, Labour member of the",18
NA,House of Commons f o r the constituency,18
NA,"of Stirling and Clackmannan, said, i n",18
NA,connexion with the marketing of do-,18
NA,minion produce i n Great B r i t a i n -,18
NA,"The immediate problem, however, was how",18
NA,tliey wore going to deal with the question,18
NA,"of British Empire trade. I t was true, he",18
NA,"thought, that commodities coming in from",18
NA,tho British Empire did not get a square,18
NA,deal. He had telephoned that day to the,18
NA,"Queensland Government offices, and had asked",18
NA,them at what price the best Queensland meat,18
NA,was being landed in London. They told him,18
NA,"it was 3jd. per lb. I t was selling at 7d.,",18
NA,"Od., and l i d . per lb. in London, according to",18
NA,the part. I f the Socialist Government were,18
NA,only to set about arranging decent market,18
NA,"conditions, secure that meat when i t arrived,",18
NA,and abolish the middlemen and suckers who,18
NA,"fastened on it, they would be able to give",18
NA,tho people of this country cheaper food and,18
NA,better food than iu many cases they_ were,18
NA,"getting now, and would be able to give . a",18
NA,better'price to the Australian producer.,18
NA,That represents the Labour point of view.,18
NA,I could quote other Labour members who,18
NA,"spoke i n similar terms, but I shall content",18
NA,myself w i th giving to honorable members,18
NA,"the testimony of Mr Stanley Baldwin,",18
NA,who represents the opposite side in,18
NA,politics. He said-,18
NA,If for the inoinent the country will not take,18
NA,"certain courses of action, we must try to iind",18
NA,others.,18
NA,The House of Commons had been dis-,18
NA,cussing the proposal f o r granting prefer-,18
NA,ence to the products of overseas - do-,18
NA,"minions, and Mr Baldwin pointed out",18
NA,"that the British people, not the Govern-",18
NA,"ment or the Parliament, had rejected the",18
NA,scheme. They regarded i t as an inter-,18
NA,"ference with their fiscal principles, and",18
NA,"I by an overwhelming m a j o r i t y , at the",18
NA,general election defeated the party which,18
NA,advocated i t . I n the face of that decision,18
NA,no Government could place preference to,18
NA,dominion products on its programme.,18
NA,Mr Baldwin continued-,18
NA,Is it not possible to enter into,18
NA,some arrangement with the dominions by,18
NA,which the enormous amount of .foodstuffs,18
NA,we require to-day may be obtained solely,18
NA,from them by bringing them into this country,18
NA,"at cost price, and distributing them with the",18
NA,least possible margin? Cannot something of,18
NA,this kind be thought out to obtain in ex-,18
NA,change for it the free entry of our manufac-,18
NA,tured goods into those dominions where such,18
NA,goods do not compete with their own.,18
Mr FOSTER , Mr Baldwin has re-,18
NA,treated f r o m that position.,18
Mr FENTON , N o . Some of the,18
NA,"newspapers criticized, his proposal, but",18
NA,"so f a r as I have been able to gather, he",18
NA,"has never retracted that declaration,",18
NA,"which, combined with the statements of.",18
NA,Labour members of the House of Com-,18
NA,"mons, proves that on both side's in British",18
NA,politics the same opinion is held as to the,18
NA,best means of improving the market f or,18
NA,dominion products. Mr Baldwin con-,18
NA,tinued-,18
NA,I do not know whether something of that,18
NA,"kind could be done, but if it could it might",18
NA,"last for the best part of a generation, and then",18
NA,the whole situation would have to be reviewed,18
NA,"again, when the population of the dominions",18
NA,"had filled up more, and they had decided",18
NA,whether they wanted to become more than they,18
NA,"are now, a manufacturing country.",18
NA,The proposal of the honorable member for,18
NA,Gippsland to amend the bill is merely,18
NA,"a temporary expedient. I n my opinion,",18
NA,the Government should accept the hint,18
NA,"dropped by the leaders of the Liberal,",18
NA,Labour and Unionist parties i n the House,18
NA,of Commons. The leader of the Tory,18
NA,"party there has declared that, i n order to",18
NA,"assist the overseas producers, the British",18
NA,Government should bring into being an,18
NA,organization for the purpose of selling,18
NA,"dominion produce at practically cost price,",18
NA,thereby lowering the price to the British,18
NA,"consumer, and - increasing the return to",18
NA,the producer in the dominions. Lord,18
NA,"Inchcape, i n his telegram to the ex-",18
NA,Prime Minister of Australia ( Mr W . M .,18
NA,"Hughes), referring to the Commonwealth",18
NA,"Government Line of Steamers said, "" We",18
NA,"cannot compete against a Government.""'",18
NA,Had the Commonwealth Government,18
NA,Line of Steamers had only private capital,19
NA,"behind i t , i t would have gone out of",19
NA,"existence long ago. Therefore, i t",19
NA,necessary for the British and Australian,19
NA,Governments to co-operate i n order to,19
NA,compete successfully against the produce,19
NA,"sellers i n London, who are so strongly",19
NA,entrenched financially that the interests,19
NA,of the dairymen of Australia cannot be,19
NA,protected merely by & committee in,19
NA,London and a board i n Australia.,19
NA,Whether co-operative action of the kind,19
NA,"required is called state socialism, or given",19
NA,"another name, i t is necessary i f the pro-",19
NA,ducers' interests and the interests of the,19
NA,consumers of Great Britain are to be con-,19
NA,served. A l l honour to fche ex-Prime M i n-,19
NA,"ister of Great Britain , when, having gone",19
NA,through the trying ordeal of a general,19
NA,"election, he stated, as Leader of the",19
NA,"Opposition, that a scheme should be",19
NA,evolved whereby all the produce from,19
NA,overseas could be taken i n hand by the,19
NA,"British Government, and disposed of to",19
NA,the mutual advantage of the Australian,19
NA,producer and the British consumer.,19
NA,Every year foodstuffs to the value of,19
NA,"£300,000,000 have to be imported by",19
NA,Great Britain . What a splendid thing,19
NA,it would be for the Empire if even half,19
NA,that quantity were handled through such,19
NA,a Government organization.,19
Mr MACKAY ,Doe s the honorable,19
NA,member think that this so-called Tory,19
NA,advocated a government organization for,19
NA,the disposal of Australia's primary pro-,19
NA,duce ?,19
Mr FENTON ,Mos t decidedly. He,19
NA,suggested that i t should be sold at cost,19
NA,"price, cutting out all the profits of the",19
NA,middleman. The honorable member,19
NA,knows that i n the marketing of dairy,19
NA,produce a profit is first made at the,19
NA,"butter factory. Next, the private agent",19
NA,in the capital city takes his toll.,19
NA,When the commodity reaches London,19
NA,the producer suffers further because i t,19
NA,has to be handled i n one of the most anti-,19
NA,quated ports i n the world. Compared,19
NA,"with Hamburg and other modern ports,",19
NA,London is out of date. Then the butter,19
NA,"goes to the blender, which means more",19
NA,"handling and more middleman's profit,",19
NA,and eventually i t reaches the hands of,19
NA,the retailer. The wonder to me is that,19
NA,the dairyman is able to live at all. This,19
NA,Parliament should endeavour to evolve a,19
NA,"scheme, in conjunction with the British",19
NA,"authorities, whereby Tooley-street, the",19
NA,"butter blender, and the multiple shop",19
NA,proprietor might be defeated and the,19
NA,"British consumer, together with the Aus-",19
NA,"is . tralian producer, protected. Millions of",19
NA,the people who have been large pur-,19
NA,"chasers of Australian butter, which, un-",19
NA,"fortunately, owing to the operations of",19
NA,"the blenders, they have obtained only in",19
NA,"its adulterated fown, are now out of em-",19
NA,"ployment, and a large number of them",19
NA,"are i n receipt, of low wages. I t is, there-",19
NA,"fore, imperative that the British Govern-",19
NA,ment should take action on the lines sug-,19
NA,gested by Mr Baldwin. He thought,19
NA,that - the arrangement might last for a,19
NA,generation. By whatever name i t might,19
NA,"be called, i t would have the most bene-",19
NA,ficial results.,19
NA,Mr M . CAMERON -Thi s bill will work,19
NA,towards that end.,19
Mr FENTON , I t is a feeble attempt,19
NA,to grapple with the problem. I t has no,19
NA,"firm basis, and therefore no superstruc-",19
NA,ture can be raised on i t . I t is necessary,19
NA,either .to amend the bill i n a drastic,19
NA,"manner, or to adopt the grand co-opera-",19
NA,"tive scheme indicated by Mr Baldwin,",19
NA,to the mutual advantage of Australian,19
NA,producers and British consumers.,19
- Mr GABB ,Angas) [ 3 . 5 0 ] - I support,19
NA,"the bill, not i n its entirety, but i n the",19
NA,hope that certain amendments w i l l be,19
NA,made to i t i n committee. I do not purpose,19
NA,this afternoon to traverse the difficulties,19
NA,and the arduous tasks of those who are,19
NA,"engaged i n the dairying industry. I do,",19
NA,"however, desire to reply to some of the",19
NA,statements that have been made during,19
NA,"the course of the debate, and to comment",19
NA,upon the attitude of certain honorable,19
NA,"members. I n particular, I should like to",19
NA,refer to a statement that was made by,19
NA,the honorable member f o r Richmond,19
NA,"( Mr R. Green), to the effect that the",19
NA,amendment that was moved at the,19
NA,second reading stage by the honorable,19
NA,member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) was,19
NA,proposed with the intention of k i l l -,19
NA,ing the bill. I n essence that amend-,19
NA,ment was supported by the majority of,19
NA,the dairymen who were represented on,19
NA,the Australian Dair y Council. I t can-,19
NA,"not be said, therefore, that the object of",19
NA,its mover was to wreck the bill.,19
Mr FORDE ,I t was unanimously sup-,19
NA,ported by dairymen f r o m all parts of,19
NA,Australia.,19
Mr GABB ,Tha t interjection effec-,19
NA,tively disposes of the contention of the,19
NA,honorable member f o r Richmond. That,19
NA,honorable -member .and the Treasurer,20
NA,(©-r. Earle Page) have said that the 'atti-,20
NA,"tude of the Labour party in the past,",20
NA,"particularly in Queensland, in regard to",20
NA,"-price fixing i n the dairying industry,",20
NA,shows that that party has not at heart,20
NA,the interests of the dairymen. There is,20
NA,"abundant evidence to the contrary. ""With-",20
NA,in the precincts of this House during the,20
NA,past week there has been an officer from,20
NA,"""Queensland, whose position was gained",20
NA,as the result of the organization of the,20
NA,primary producers .that was made pos-,20
NA,sible by .the financial -assistance .rendered,20
NA,"by ""the Labour -Government in Queens-",20
NA,land. Even the honorable member for,20
NA,Lilley (Mir. Mackay) was prepared to,20
NA,give that Government credit f or what it,20
NA,had achieved. Perhaps I should not be,20
NA,.stating (the .position correctly i f I said,20
NA,-that that officer was ;sent ito Melbourne,20
NA,.by ithe Queensland Lafboiw Government;,20
NA,ibuit at a l l evenfts he is 'here with the,20
NA,-consent of that 'Government. I 'ask the,20
NA,"honorable member for Richmond, what",20
NA,.has .the Naticsnafldst Govern-men't -o'f,20
NA,New South Wales 3one to assist,20
NA,-the dairying industiry -in that direc-,20
NA,tion? .During the progress of this,20
NA,"-debate, has i t had within rthe pre-",20
NA,^cincts of this House fan 'Officer watching,20
NA,.the interests of the dairy farmers of New,20
NA,-South Wales ? I hold i n my hand a copy,20
NA,of a telegram that was -sent by ithe,20
NA,.Queen slamd Labour Government to the,20
NA,"-Governments of New South Wales, Vic-",20
NA,"toria, .South Australia, ""Western Aus-",20
NA,"tralia, .and 'Tasmania. I -3© not intend",20
NA,to put i t >on record unless I am 'chal-,20
NA,"lenged, because ""it is r-aJther lengthy; but",20
NA,"fits {purpose -was to ""induce 'these Go-",20
NA,vernments to fall into line behind the,20
NA,-scheme for the stabilization of the dairy-,20
NA,ing industry that was then being 'con-,20
NA,sidered. I again utsk the 'honorable -mem-,20
NA,"ber for Richmond, has tihe Premier -of",20
NA,New 'South Wales circularized' the other,20
NA,Govemmemits ?,20
NA,Mr R. 'GREEN ; - I hold no brief -for the,20
NA,Premier of New ''South Wales.,20
NA,Mr 'GABB -Althoug h the honorable,20
NA,member says that he holds no brief .for,20
NA,"'the Premier of New South Wales, the",20
NA,party to which he owes allegiance is,20
NA,"assisting to keep a Nationalist ""Govern-",20
NA,"ment in office i n that state, just as i t is",20
NA,doing in this House. But the point,20
NA,I am 'endeavouring to make is,20
NA,that the Nationalist Premier Of New,20
NA,South Wales has not done any-,20
NA,thing to assist the dairying 'indus-,20
NA,"try. The 'Queensland Labour Premier,",20
NA,"-on the contrary, has inter-ested hdm-",20
NA,"-self very greatly in the matter, despite",20
NA,the 'assertion of the honorable mem-,20
NA,ber for Richmond that the Labour,20
NA,"party generally, and the Labour Go-",20
NA,vernment of Queensland in particu-,20
NA,"lar, has no desire to assist the",20
NA,dairying industry. The honorable mem-,20
NA,ber for Richmond may be able to point,20
NA,to one action of the Queensland Labour,20
NA,"Government to .support his argument,",20
NA,but i t cannot be denied that in the -main,20
NA,the dairymen of Queensland have been,20
NA,satisfied with its 'administration. Proof,20
NA,of that is afforded by the fact that they,20
NA,were largely instrumental in returning,20
NA,.that government to power at .thei last state,20
NA,"-elections. On the 31st July last, in the",20
NA,.Gourse of .a speech which I .delivered :in,20
NA,this House i n .connexion with the dairying,20
NA,"industry., I stated-",20
NA,I f (honorable members wish to .account for,20
NA,the delay that has taken .place in 'giving effect,20
NA,-to the project for the stabilization of the,20
NA,".dairying industry, I tell them that, although",20
NA,-Hie proprietary companies may appear to be,20
NA,working hand i n 4iand with the co-operative,20
NA,"companies, they .are rselling .them 'hi the dark.",20
NA,"Those are the ""persons who are .preventing the",20
NA,stabilization o'f their industry desired by the,20
NA,-dairymen o'f Australia to-day.,20
NA,Proof of .the correctness of that statement,20
NA,is contained in a memorandum sent by,20
NA,"Mr L . R. Macgregor, director, Council",20
NA,"-of Agriculture, Brisbane, to every Queens-",20
NA,land member of the Federal Parliament.,20
NA,".As i t is not marked "" confidential,"" I",20

NA,.they 'did not raise .such objection when present,20

NA,Workers -are workers whether they !are,21
NA,"employed i n the .field or i n the factory.,",21
NA,and .a Labour Minister f o r 'Customs would,21
NA,be just .as much concerned .to prevent the,21
NA,exploitation of workers i n ithe country as,21
NA,of workers i n the city. The .party of,21
NA,which the honorable member for Kooyong,21
NA,is .a member is not always friendly to the,21
NA,dairymen and producers generally. That,21
NA,the producers recognize this was .shown by,21
NA,"the result of the last election ""in Victoria.",21
NA,The dairymen are more certain .of getting,21
NA,It justice .from the Labour party than -from,21
NA,any other political .party. These -argu-,21
NA,ments effectively dispose of ithe honorable,21
NA,member's suggestion to which I have .re-,21
NA,"ferred,, but he made some other -remarks",21
NA,to which I mnst Teply. He said-,21
NA,A Minister might compel one person .to sell,21
NA,"a'll his tatter in Australia, and 'he might per-",21
NA,mit another to sell sa-Ll Ihis iproduct abroad.,21
NA,"lin my opinion, the licences -which will",21

NA,"ticular -.parcels of butter, but will be",21

NA,-not ing channel was closed another could 'be,21
NA,a found so long as the quality was up to,21
NA,"The honorable """,21
NA,\ipon member also 'said-,21
NA,"I have heard i t sai'd that some 90 per cent,",21
NA,or -more o'f fhe butter 'producers of Australia,21
NA,"are behind the scheme for single control, and",21
NA,"I do not understand wiry, if 00 per cent, of",22
NA,the butter producers are sufficiently intelligent,22
NA,to ses that the establishment of a single,22
NA,"agency is required, they do not set up such",22
NA,an agency on their own account . . . .,22
NA,Nobody has explained why this co-operation,22
NA,should be brought about by compulsory legis-,22
NA,"lation, which will interfere with individual",22
NA,liberty.,22
NA,"I interjected, "" The dairymen have",22
NA,"already had a try i n the home market.""",22
NA,The honorahle member then observed-,22
NA,"In most industries if 90 per cent, of those",22
NA,"interested, are determined on a certain course,",22
NA,"they are able <to command the market, pro-",22
NA,vided trhey stick together. If they will not,22
NA,voluntarily act co-operatively i t is their own,22
NA,fault if they suffer from the lack of co-,22
NA,operation.,22
NA,"I n view of a l l these statements, I ask",22
NA,honorable members opposite who claim,22
NA,that all the members on their side of,22
NA,the House represent the primary pro-,22
NA,"ducing interests, and that the Labour",22
NA,"party is indifferent to them, what sym-",22
NA,pathy the dairymen could expect f r o m,22
NA,"the honorable member for Kooyong,",22
NA,who is called a Liberal i,22
NA,can find anything i n the speech,22
NA,from which I have just quoted to,22
NA,show that he issympathetic with the,22
NA,"dairymen, they w i l l be smart indeed.",22
NA,The honorable member went on to speak,22
NA,about the possibility of the butter pro-,22
NA,ducers asking f o r an advance f r o m the,22
NA,Government i n order to establish the,22
NA,scheme. Before dealing with that aspect,22
NA,of his argument I must express my regret,22
NA,"that,. although the Prime Minister said",22
NA,three or four days ago that another b i l l,22
NA,would be introduced which would be,22
NA,"complementary to this one, we have not",22
NA,yet seen anything of i t . I cannot see,22
NA,any reason why i t should not have been,22
NA,tabled w i t h this one. We are being,22
NA,asked i n this bill to agree to the pro-,22
NA,"visions of a measure, that is not yet i n ex-",22
NA,istence; which seems to me to be a hap-,22
NA,hazard way of doing business.,22
NA,"kind of ""shut your eyes and open your",22
NA,"mouth "" game of which I do not approve.",22
Mr BRUCE , I said i n my second-,22
NA,reading speech that the bill to which the,22
NA,honorable member refers would contain a,22
NA,provision for a levy of an amount not,22
NA,exceeding one-eighth of a penny per lb.,22
NA,"in the case of butter, and one-sixteenth",22
NA,- of a penny per l b . i n the case of cheese.,22
Mr GABB ,Th e honorable gentleman,22
NA,"also said, I think, that the bill would",22
NA,provide for an advance of up to 80 per,22
NA,"cent, of the market value of the product.",22
NA,"On this subject, the honorable member",22
NA,for Kooyong said-,22
NA,Either it is an advance.that is commercially,22
NA,"justifiable or i t is not. If 'it is, the advance can-",22
NA,be obtained outside in the ordinary money,22
NA,"market. If, on tbe other hand, it is not com-",22
NA,"mercially justifiable, how can the Government",22
NA,justify making it?,22
NA,Again I ask the honorable member for,22
NA,Richmond to notice whence came this,22
NA,criticism. I am not sure that i f the ad-,22
NA,vance is commercially justifiable i t can be,22
NA,obtained outside. I f the export control,22
NA,board cuts out some of the big specu-,22
NA,lators i t is probable that the' latter will,22
NA,bring influence to bear upon private bank-,22
NA,ing institutions not to finance the scheme.,22
NA,I have a clear recollection of what hap-,22
NA,pened i n connexion with some of the,22
NA,Wheat Pool arrangements. A private,22
NA,"banking institution, when approached for",22
NA,"financial assistance, stated that i t was",22
NA,not i n accord with its policy t o do,22
NA,"so. On that occasion, although the",22
NA,"advance was commercially justifiable,",22
NA,outside influences were brought to bear,22
NA,I f they upon the institution referred to. I think,22
NA,the honorable member for Kooyong is,22
NA,losing sight of the fact that the main,22
NA,"purpose of the bill is, not to provide the",22
NA,"machinery to finance the export trade,",22
NA,but to control the export of butter and,22
NA,"cheese from Australia, i n order that the",22
NA,"identity of the commodity, as an Aus-",22
NA,"tralian product, may be firmly established",22
NA,in the overseas market. The expression,22
NA,""" commercially justifiable "" has impressed",22
NA,me. Some honorable members appear t o ',22
NA,think that unless the proposal can be com-,22
NA,"mercially justified, i t must not be pro-",22
NA,"ceeded with. I realize, of course, how",22
NA,important i t is that the scheme should,22
NA,"pay its way, but even i f the balance-sheet",22
NA,"shows a debit, the Government will not",22
NA,"be justified i n turning down the scheme,",22
NA,the essential purpose of which is to im-,22
NA,prove the conditions of those engaged in,22
NA,the industry. I have commented freely,22
NA,I t is a upon the remarks made by the honorable,22
NA,"member for Kooyong, because, up to now,",22
NA,he is the only member on that side of the,22
NA,"House who has openly opposed the bill,",22
NA,"and, i n my opinion, he represents the",22
NA,views of the proprietary interests. The,22
NA,bill will be subjected to keen scrutiny i n,22
NA,committee. Already a considerable num-,22
NA,"ber of amendments have been circulated,",22
NA,"and others, I know, w i l l be submitted.",22
NA,Question resolved i n the affirmative.,22
NA,B i l l read a second time.,22
NA,In committee:,22
NA,Clause 1 agreed to.,22
NA,Clause 2-,23
NA,"Sections one,, two, five, and thirty ot this",23

NA,section shall not issue unless and until at a,23

Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [4.15] - I,23
NA,move-,23
NA,"That all the words after the words "" Pro-",23
NA,"vided t h a t "" be left out, with a view to insert",23
NA,"in lieu thereof the words "" a f t e r this Act has",23
NA,been in operation for twenty-three months a,23
NA,poll of producers shall immediately be taken,23
NA,"as to its continuance or otherwise, a majority",23
NA,"of votes to decide the question "".",23
NA,This subject has been fully discussed by,23
NA,"the dairymen throughout Australia, and",23
NA,it is their wish that a provisional direc-,23
NA,torate should be appointed so soon as this,23
NA,"measure becomes law. The provisional,",23
NA,council of agriculture appointed under,23
NA,the Queensland agricultural scheme beid,23
NA,office for about fifteen months. At the,23
NA,end of that period a ballot of the primary,23
NA,producers ot' the state was taken to ap-,23
NA,point representatives to the council for,23
NA,"a further period, A complete scheme of",23
NA,"stabilization, of which the proposed ex-",23
NA,port control scheme under. the bill,23
NA,"is only a part, has been discussed by Aus-",23
NA,"tralian dairymen for many months past,",23
NA,and there is the greatest unanimity,23
NA,among them in favour of it -Such minor,23
NA,opposition as there is to the scheme is,23
NA,directly or indirectly attributable to pro-,23
NA,"prietary interests, which are endeavour-",23
NA,"ing to have a poll taken, when the bill is",23
NA,"passed, and before .any result can be",23
NA,shown to delay the operation of the,23
NA,scheme. Meetings to discuss the scheme in,23
NA,"Queensland were called, and all butter",23
NA,factories except one were there repre-,23
NA,sented. The dairymen who attended,23
NA,were unanimously in favour of the pro-,23
NA,posal put forward by the Interstate,23
NA,"Dairy Conference, from which proposal",23
NA,some of the provisions in this bill are,23
NA,"taken. The bill does not go far enough,",23
NA,but still it is based upon the request made,23
NA,to the rrinie Minister by delegates at the,23
NA,Interstate Dairy Conference. Meetings,23
NA,were also held by representatives of the,23
NA,Queensland Co-operative Dairy Com-,23
NA,"itanies' Association, the Queensland Manu-",23
NA,"facturers' Association, the Queensland",23
NA,"Cheese Pool Board, and the Queensland",23
NA,Council of Agriculture. They supported,23
NA,the proposal unanimously. I t must be,23
NA,"remembered that 95 per cent, of the",23
NA,Queensland dairy produce is co-opera-,23
NA,tively controlled. Since all the co-opera-,23
NA,tive factories have unanimously endorsed,23
NA,"the scheme proposed under the bill, there",23
NA,is really no need for delay in order that,23
NA,a poll of the producers may be taken. On,23
NA,the 5th September last a special confer-,23
NA,ence of all dairying interests was held in,23
NA,"Queensland, and the delegates to i t un-",23
NA,animously accepted the proposal placed,23
NA,before the Government by the Interstate,23
NA,"Dairying Conference. I n addition, local",23
NA,producers' associations and district coun-,23
NA,cils in Queensland have passed numerous,23
NA,resolutions requesting the Government to,23
NA,introduce not only a bill similar to that,23
NA,"now before the committee, but also one",23
NA,dealing with the marketing of dairy pro-,23
NA,duce throughout Australia. The amend-,23
NA,ment that I moved on the second reading,23
NA,was to establish a tribunal to fix the price,23
NA,of dairy produce for interstate trade,23
NA,"based on the cost of production,",23
NA,as asked for by the Interstate,23
NA,Dairy Conference. Honorable members,23
NA,supporting the Government have said,23
NA,"that the effect of such an amendment, i f",23
NA,"passed, would be to delay the bill, but",23
NA,I then proposed to delay the introduction,23
NA,"of the bill for six days only, so that pro-",23
NA,vision could be made in it for dealing,23
NA,with not only the one-third of the dairy,23
NA,"produce exported, but also the two-thirds",23
NA,sold on the Australian market. There is,23
NA,"really no need to, delay the operation of",23
NA,the bill to allow a. poll of the pro-,23
NA,ducers to be taken. There are,23
NA,"120,000 dairymen in the Common-",23
NA,"wealth, and the cost of taking a",23
NA,"ballot of them is estimated at £2,000. The",23
NA,taking of a ballot would give the pro-,23
NA,"prietary interests an opportunity, by",23
NA,misrepresentations through the columns,23
NA,"of the press supporting them, to induce",23
NA,"the dairymen to reject the scheme, and",23
NA,would impose needless expense upon the,23
NA,taxpayers of this country. The dairymen,23
NA,"at the Interstate Conference in April,",23
NA,"and again in July, were unanimously in",23
NA,favour of control of marketing and a,23
NA,scheme of stabilization. That scheme has,23
NA,"now been delayed for some time, and",23
NA,if further delay were occasioned by,23
NA,"taking, a poll jhist at the commencement",24
NA,"of the export season,, the producers",24
NA,"would receive no benefit, from, the-",24
NA,scheme this year.. As soon,24
NA,the bill is passed a provisional,24
NA,"board should be appointed f o r 23 months,",24
NA,andi after that period has expired a vote,24
NA,should be taken of the,24
NA,ducers i n Australia f o r the appointment,24
NA,of a dairy produce export control,24
NA,"board.. Totake a ballot now, sup-",24
NA,pliers? rolls would have t o be obtained,24
NA,f r o m eaeh butter factory and checked),24
NA,very carefully. I t is difficult to; get ac-,24
NA,"curate rolls, because some dairymen",24
NA,supply two different factories within a,24
NA,brief period. I t would be quite,24
NA,possible f o r one farmer to. be on two,24
NA,different rolls and to record two votesat,24
NA,a poll unless the greatest care is taken.,24
NA,"When the act has been, i n operation f o r",24
NA,"nearly two yearsj the producers, w i l l",24
NA,know whether the scheme is satisfactory.,24
NA,"I f my amendment is carried, the pro-",24
NA,visional board appointed' wilt be able dur-,24
NA,ing the next 23 months tomake f u l l i n -,24
NA,"quiries, and at the end of that period",24
NA,!,24
NA,to place before the suppliers definite,24
NA,proof whether the scheme is justified. To,24
NA,take a poll at present would be very un-,24
NA,wise. The farmers w i l l be i n the,24
NA,dark. This bill w i l l not give to the,24
NA,producers a l l the relief that they need.,24
NA,Any one. who believes that thebig com-,24
NA,binations i n Great Britain can be broken,24
NA,"u p within a few months, and that, as a",24
NA,"result, the dairymen of Australia will",24
NA,"secure a higher price for their buttear,",24
NA,is making a fatal mistake. I n the first,24
NA,"place,, honorable membejrs should bear i n",24
NA,mind that this bill deals only with the,24
NA,one-third of the output of butter i n Aus-,24
NA,tralia which is exported. There will still,24
NA,be two-thirds of i t sold on the Australian,24
NA,"market i n an unregulated way, and with-",24
NA,out any regard to the need for nroviding,24
NA,for a living wage for dairymen. I men-,24
NA,tion this because the Treasurer has. said,24
NA,"that i f this, bill is. passed, dairymen will",24
NA,get immediate relief.,24
Dr EARLE PAGE ,S o they w i l l .,24
NA,"Mr FORDE,-Ever y one must know tralian! producers.",24
NA,that the passing of this bill will not,24

Dr EARLE PAGE ,Th e passing of the,24
NA,"bill will help those, engaged! i n the dairyexperience^",24
NA,ing industry very materially.,24
Mr FORDE , I agree that i t will' be-,24
NA,"a. step i n that direction, but for at least",24
NA,two yeaES i t is not likely to give any,24
NA,as benefit to tbe dairymen of Australia.,24
NA,"They have requested, that something-",24
NA,should be done by the appointment of. a.,24
NA,"tribunal, such as that for which I",24
NA,"pro- moved, to fix theprice; of butter for the",24
NA,interstate trade uponthe basis of the cost,24
NA,of production. The Government has-,24
NA,"turned that scheme down, and the Trea-",24
NA,surer now tell's the dairymen that the,24
NA,passing of this bill to deal w i t h,24
NA,export will give them immediate,24
NA,relief. We know what happened,24
NA,in New Zealand.. Early in. 1923. a mea-,24
NA,"sure similar to this, but going further",24
NA,"than thisbill proposes to go, was: passed",24
NA,"i n New Zealand, and a l l that has been",24
NA,done under' i t up to the present has been,24
NA,to carry out certain investigations i n Lon-,24
NA,don i n connexion with the marketing; of,24
NA,New Zealand butter.,24
NA,. Mr J . FnANOis -Tha t was the inten-,24
NA,tion of the New Zealand measure.,24
Mr FORDE ,"Yes , b u t i t has been",24
NA,"passed for over twelve months, and the",24
NA,dairymenof New Zealand have derived,24
NA,no. benefit f r o m i t up to the present time.,24
NA,I . ask honorable members not to t r y to,24
NA,mislead the dairymen of Australia by,24
NA,telling them that thisb i l l w i l l give them,24
NA,all they desire. I t w i l l take nearly two,24
NA,years to bring the machinery of this,24
NA,measure into operation. I t w i l l be neces-,24
NA,sary to send representatives to London to,24
NA,"carry out preliminary investigations,",24
NA,and negotiate with the Tooley-street,24
NA,"agents, before anything effective can",24
NA,be done. The honorable member,24
NA,for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) has,24
NA,already referred to the report of Mr .,24
NA,"O'Callaghan, the Commonwealth dairy",24
NA,expert. ETe has pointed out that those,24
NA,who believe that by the appointment of,24
NA,a board to control the exportof dairy,24
NA,produce we can push out the Tooley-,24
NA,"street agents i n six, or i n twelve, months",24
NA,"are making a stupid blunder, because as",24
NA,soon as we begin to fight them they will,24
NA,fight us by trading i n Danish and Argen-,24
NA,"tine butter, to the detriment of Aus-",24
NA,Mr O'Callaghan has,24
NA,be recently been appointed t o an important,24
NA,"i n position m the Argentine, a country",24
NA,"which has done much t o improve, its",24
NA,marketing conditions. He. has been,24
NA,"taken away f r o m Australia, with his ripe",24
NA,andi the Argentine w i l l now,24
NA,have the benefit of the knowledge he has,25
NA,gained here. Even i f we appointed a,25
NA,"provisional board afr present, i t would",25
NA,take some time to carry out preliminary,25
NA,"investigation, and get the organization",25
NA,into operation. W h y should,25
NA,Government unduly delay the opera-,25
NA,tion of this Act? I,25
NA,there should he no further delay.,25
NA,I intend later on to submit an amend-,25
NA,ment dealing with the constitution of the,25
NA,"proposed board., and another dealing",25
NA,with the election of the members of,25
NA,the Dairy Produce Control Board.,25
NA,I hope that the Prime Minister will not,25
NA,put the country to the expense of a poll,25
NA,"of the dairymen at present, but will , i n",25
NA,accordance with the views of representa-,25
NA,tives of delegates f r o m butter fac-,25
NA,"tories co-opcTatively controlled, bring",25
NA,the bill into operation immediately.,25
NA,"W i t h i n two years, when they w i l l",25
NA,have had some experience of the re-,25
NA,"sults of its operation, a poll should be",25
NA,taken for the election of the members of,25
NA,the Dairy Produce Control Board.,25
NA,the meantime a provisional board only,25
NA,should be appointed.,25
Mr MANNING ,Macquarie) [4.35] -,25
NA,I trust that the committee will not accept,25
NA,the amendment. We are dealing at pre-,25
NA,sent with very important and far-reach-,25
NA,ing legislation. Notwithstanding what,25
NA,has been said by the,25
NA,member fo r 'Capricornia ( Mr Forde),25
NA,"to the contrary, there is great di-",25
NA,versity of opinion amongst dairymen on,25
NA,the subject of the b i l l. Since the House,25
NA,rose on Friday I have been consulted,25
NA,"about i t i n Sydney, and I found that",25
NA,whilst some persons strongly support the,25
NA,"measure, there are others as strongly op-",25
NA,posed to 'it. I t would be very unwise,25
NA,that such legislation should be rushed,25
NA,through. The honorable member for,25
NA,Capricornia has said that i t cannot be,25
NA,"of much benefit for a considerable'time,",25
NA,and I say that we should take the neces-,25
NA,say precaution of having a poll of the,25
NA,producers to discover whether the measure,25
NA,is approved by them.,25
NA,MT . FORDE -Th e producers generally,25
NA,"""want the b i l l , but those 'controlling the",25
NA,proprietary butter factories do n o t want,25
NA,it.,25
Mr MANNING , The honorable,25
NA,member may sneak for some who have,25
NA,"consulted him, but I speak Tor some who",25
NA,have consulted me. I say that a number,25
NA,of the producers wish to have a poll taken,25
NA,upon this measure. A l l the factories,25
NA,"have their own lists of suppliers, and",25
NA,though the honorable member for Capri-,25
NA,cornia has pointed out that one man may -,25
NA,"the be supplying more than one factory, i t",25
NA,should be a very easy matter to discover,25
NA,say - that from the lists who are supplying more,25
NA,than one factory. We must assume that,25
NA,a little common sense will be used i n the,25
NA,taking of the poll. I think i t would be,25
NA,very unwise of the committee to accept,25
NA,the amendment or any amendment which,25
NA,would defeat the provision for the taking,25
NA,of a poll before the bill becomes law. I f,25
NA,i t is found that the producers are i n,25
NA,"favour of i t , tbe board w i l l have t h e .",25
NA,greater confidence i n going on with the,25
NA,administration of the measure. I t might,25
NA,"be .advisable, i n a few years' time, after",25
NA,"they had had some experience of i t , to",25
NA,take a poll to see whether the producers,25
NA,desired that the proposed control should,25
NA,continue.,25
Mr MCGRATH ,Ballarat) £4.40] - I,25
NA,In am sorry to have to disagree with the,25
NA,honorable member for Capricornia ( Mr .,25
NA,Forde) on this matter. I can' see no-,25
NA,thing wrong i n consulting the producers,25
NA,by having a poll taken t o discover whether,25
NA,bhey are i n f avour of this measure or -not.,25
NA,We have been told that i t would take two,25
NA,-or three months to ha?e a poll of the,25
NA,"butter producers taken, but that is the",25
NA,"honorable business of the ""Government.",25
Mr MANNING ,Ther e is JIO reason why,25
NA,i t should take so long.,25
NA,MT . MCGRATH -Tha t is so. I f the,25
NA,producers do not wsjit this method of,25
NA,dealing with .the export of butter they,25
NA,have a. right to be allowed to say .so. T,25
NA,think they should be consulted as to,25
NA,whether a board should be appointed to,25
NA,control the -export of butter. I found,25
NA,nothing i n the arguments of the honor-,25
NA,able member for Capricornia to support,25
NA,the postponement of a poll of the pro-,25
NA,ducers. I f the b i l l is .a good one there,25
NA,is nothing to prevent its being brought,25
NA,int o operation within three or four,25
NA,months. I n connexion with a federal,25
NA,election we can take a poll of the electors,25
NA,of Australia i n a month. I see nothing,25
NA,to .prevent a poll o'f the dairy farmers on,25
NA,this measure being taken within three or,25
NA,four weeks. I very much regret that I,25
NA,cannot see «ye to eye with the honorable,25
NA,member for 'Capricornia on this matter.,25
NA,I can scarcely conceive 'Of the present Go-,25

Mr R GREEN ,Richmond) [4.43] -,26
NA,Referring first of all to the - remarks of,26
NA,those who suggest that the measure should,26
NA,be put into operation for a certain period,26
NA,before a poll of the producers is taken,26
NA,"upon i t , I should like to direct the at-",26
NA,tention of honorable members to the de-,26
NA,"finition clause, i n which i t is provided",26
NA,that-,26
NA,""" Producers"" means persons carrying on",26
NA,business .is suppliers of milk or cream to,26
NA,tories manufacturing dairy produce for export.,26
NA,"That raises the question, who are to",26
NA,be considered producers ? Many butter,26
NA,factories manufacture butter for sale in,26
NA,their local markets or within the state in,26
NA,"which they are established, and not for",26
NA,export. The bill is of vital importance,26
NA,to these producers because the local price,26
NA,is governed by the export price. Is i t,26
NA,intended that they should be disfran-,26
NA,chised because they happen to supply fac-,26
NA,tories that do not specifically manufac-,26
NA,"ture for export. There might, i f the defi-",26
NA,"nition were adopted as i t stands, be some",26
NA,argument as to who are entitled to be,26
NA,"enrolled as producers, and i t would take",26
NA,some time to compile the rolls.,26
NA,hoped that the board of control will be,26
NA,able to do something for the benefit of the,26
NA,"dairying industry of Australia, and i f",26
NA,"that hope is to be realized, the sooner the",26
NA,measure is brought into operation the,26
NA,"better. I f ""the measure is brought into",26

NA,To show whether or not the dairymen,26
NA,"desire this scheme, I shall read a telegram",26
NA,which I have received from the president,26
NA,of the Farmers' and Settlers'. Association,26

NA,"whether i t had proved beneficial or not,",26
NA,a poll should be taken.,26
NA,NA,26
NA,"know the provisions of the b i l l ; then, how",26
NA,could they agree to it?,26
NA,"Mr R GREEN"" - I had an idea that",26
NA,the b i ll would be framed along the lines,26
NA,fac- of the recommendations of the interstate,26
NA,conference. As I was a delegate to that,26
NA,"conference, and attended all its meetings,",26
NA,I was able to give those present a f a i r,26
NA,idea of what the provisions of the bill,26
NA,"were, likely to be. A t a later stage, I",26
NA,"propose to move an amendment which,",26
NA,although apparently the same as .that,26
NA,moved by the honorable member f o r,26
NA,"Capricornia ( Mr Forde), is totally",26
NA,different. I n preparing this amend-,26
NA,"ment, my desire has been to remove the",26
NA,present ambiguity as to the date on which,26
NA,the measure w i l l come into operation.,26
NA,"Sections 1, 2, 5, and 30 ! are",26
NA,to come into operation on the date,26
NA,"on which assent to the b i l l is given,",26

NA,-,26
NA,"vides for a poll "" after this act has been",26

NA,"over the difficulty of having two dates, I",26
NA,"propose to omit all the words after "" Pro-",26
NA,"clamation,"" and to insert other words in.",26
NA,their place. My amendment contains a,26

Mr R GREEN ,Onl y one amend-,27
NA,ment has yet been moved. I was pointing,27
NA,out the difference between the amendment,27
NA,of the honorable member for Capricornia,27
NA,and that which I propose to move. While,27
NA,the principle underlying both is the same,27
NA,in that both desire that the act shall come,27
NA,"into operation forthwith, that a board shall",27
NA,"be constituted as soon as possible, and",27
NA,that no time be lost i n taking a poll of,27
NA,"the producers, there is a difference in",27
NA,other respects.,27
Mr BRUCE ,Flinders-Prim e Minis-,27
NA,ter and Minister for External Affairs),27
NA,[4.50] -Th e Government cannot accept,27
NA,the amendment of the honorable member,27
NA,"for Capricornia ( Mr Forde), as there is",27
NA,no direct evidence that a majority of the,27
NA,dairy producers of Australia desires this,27
NA,measure. I t has been suggested that the,27
NA,"Government has that evidence, but that",27
NA,"is not so, although I believe that suffi-",27
NA,cient evidence was adduced to show that,27
NA,a majority of dairy farmers desired the,27
NA,scheme which was originally propounded,27
NA,by a conference of those engaged i n the,27
NA,"dairying industry. Even i n that case,",27
NA,"however, the evidence was not entirely",27
NA,"convincing. . Still, the Government could",27
NA,"not see its way to accept that scheme, and",27
NA,"after certain conferences had been held,",27
NA,"and negotiations had taken place, we de-",27
NA,cided to introduce this measure. I i n -,27
NA,dicated to those interested that we de-,27
NA,sired convincing evidence that legislation,27
NA,of. this nature was wanted by them. A,27
NA,number of those interested intimated their,27
NA,Support of the action contemplated by,27
NA,"the Government, but i n no case was sup-",27
NA,port directly promised for this particular,27
NA,measure. The expressions of approval,27
NA,"which were received referred, i n most i n - season.",27
NA,"stances, to what is generally termed the",27
NA,""" Paterson scheme."" As that scheme is",27
NA,not embodied in this bill I am not i n a,27
NA,position to say that the measure has their,27
NA,support. There is not conclusive evidence,27
NA,that those i n the dairying industry really,27
NA,desire action along the lines contemplated,27
NA,"in this bill, and i t is essential that they",27
NA,should have the opportunity to express,27
NA,"their opinion regarding tne measure, be-",27
NA,"cause, being limited to the export trade,",27
NA,i t deals only with the exportation of,27
NA,butter.,27
Mr FENTON ,I b affects all the,27
NA,sumers of butter.,27
Mr BRUCE ,Th e bill deals only with,27
NA,"the exportation of butter, and as only the",27
NA,"producers of butter are concerned, they",27
NA,are entitled to an opportunity to say,27
NA,whether they desire i t or not. I appre-,27
NA,"ciate the seriousness of delay, but I do",27
NA,not think that the anticipation that the,27
NA,taking of a poll would be a lengthy pro-,27
NA,ceeding is justifiable. I agree with the,27
NA,remarks of the honorable member for,27
NA,Richmond ( Mr R. Green) regarding the,27
NA,"definition of "" producers."" Most of the",27
NA,"factories i n this country have, at some",27
NA,"time or other, produced butter for ex-",27
NA,"port.' Later, I propose to move to strike",27
NA,"out of the definition of "" producers "" the",27
NA,"words "" for export."" The poll could",27
NA,"then be taken at the factories, and I",27
NA,know of no way i n which i t could be,27
NA,taken more quickly. I f the voting shows,27
NA,"that the producers desire the measure,",27
NA,there should be ample time for the board,27
NA,to be appointed early enough to function,27
NA,before the next season of heavy exporta-,27
NA,tion. I do not share the apprehension of,27
NA,some honorable members that much time,27
NA,must elapse before the opinion of the,27
NA,dairy farmers can be known. I con-,27
NA,sider that there should be no diffi-,27
NA,culty i n taking the poll within a,27
NA,period of one month or six weeks.,27
NA,Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [4.58] -,27
NA,I n my second-reading speech I indicated,27
NA,that I would move or support an amend-,27
NA,ment providing for a poll of the pro-,27
NA,ducers to be taken at the end of two,27
NA,"years, so that the provisions of this bill",27
NA,might be put into operation at the,27
NA,earliest moment. I am anxious that,27
NA,assistance should be given as soon,27
NA,as possible to those engaged i n the dairy-,27
NA,ing industry. I desire that that assistance,27
NA,shall be given them for this export,27
NA,The Prime Minister stated,27
NA,that he had not sufficient informatio n to,27

NA,"all these provisions for expenditure, i t is",30
NA,probable that the majority of the pro-,30
NA,ducers will be afraid of the scheme. They,30
NA,may hold that i t is i n the interests of,30
NA,the companies rather than the actual pro-,30
NA,ducers. Having regard to the enormous,30
NA,"powers to be vested i n the board, and",30
NA,"the expenses entailed, the only sensible",30
NA,"thing to do is to .ask, forthwith, those",30
NA,engaged i n .the industry to express their,30
NA,opinion upon the bill. The Prime M i n -,30
NA,ister is right i n saying that i t should be,30
NA,possible for a poll to be taken within a,30
NA,few weeks. I do not think the con-,30
NA,sumers are very much interested i n the,30
NA,"measure, because i t relates to only that",30
NA,one-third of the total output which is to,30
NA,be exported.,30
Mr FENTON , I do not accept that,30
NA,view.,30
NA,Mr O'Keefe.,30
Mr OKEEFE ,Ther e may be room,30
NA,"for difference of opinion upon that point,",30
NA,but I regard the bill as likely to prove,30
NA,more dangerous to the producers than to,30
NA,"the consumers. Therefore, the producers",30
NA,should be consulted as soon as possible.,30
NA,The poll should not be deferred until the,30
NA,scheme has been i n operation for a couple,30
NA,"of years, for possibly by that time a",30
NA,great deal of damage will have been,30
NA,done. I f after the producers have de-,30
NA,clared i n favour of the bill i t does not,30
NA,"f u l f i l their expectations, i t can be",30
NA,'amended or. repealed - I oppose the,30
NA,amendment.,30
Mr R GREEN ,Richmond) [5.22] -,30
NA,The Prime Minister said a poll of the,30
NA,producers could be taken i n about four,30
NA,"weeks through the various factories, but",30
NA,according to the definition clause all fac-,30
NA,tories will not come within the scope of,30
NA,"the bill, and, therefore, the poll will be",30
NA,"limited to certain producers, and others",30
NA,will be disfranchised. I f a poll is to be,30
NA,"taken, all producers should be entitled to",30
NA,vote. I emphasize again the anomaly of,30
NA,this Parliament enacting legislation for,30
NA,"the benefit of a section of the community,",30
NA,and then asking them by means of a poll,30
NA,if they want i t . I have heard of no pro-,30
NA,posal to ask the commercial community,30
NA,if i t approves of the Bankruptcy B i l l .,30
NA,Surely the collective wisdom of this House,30
NA,should be capable of evolving a measure,30
NA,to meet the requirements of the dairying,30
NA,industry. I protest against the taking,30
NA,of a poll. The butter producers i n my,30
NA,"electorate are i n favour of this bill , and",30
NA,they desire i t to be brought into operation,30
NA,forthwith.,30
Mr ANSTEY ,Bourke) [5.26] -Thi s,30
NA,bill is a legislative innovation - As a rule,30
NA,' a Government makes up its mind that,30
NA,certain legislation is i n the interests of,30
NA,"the country, and i t relies upon the",30
NA,majority supporting i t to carry its pro-,30
NA,posals through Parliament; but appa-,30
NA,rently this Government has not made up,30
NA,its mind upon this subject. There is a,30
NA,"diversity of opinion, not only amongst",30
NA,those who claim to represent the pro-,30
NA,"ducers, but even amongst Ministers. I",30
NA,"do not represeut a rural constituency, but",30
NA,"my constituency, like that of the honor-",30
NA,"able member for Brisbane, has some cows,",30
NA,"\vhich, feeding upon the luxuriant pas-",30
NA,"tures of the street gutters, produce fine",30
NA,"butter. Therefore, the honorable mem-",30
NA,ber for Brisbane and I may claim to be,30
NA,experts on this subject. But has the,30
NA,Prime Minister made up his mind 1 No I,31
NA,Does he believe that the bill will benefit,31
NA,the butter producers? He is not sure.,31
NA,He says that something must be done to,31
NA,"help the dairying industry, but what",31
NA,shall i t be ? As those who are actually,31
NA,engaged in the industry are not certain,31
NA,"of what they want, outside the Paterson",31
NA,"scheme, the Prime Minister said, "" Let",31
NA,us suggest something similar to the New,31
NA,"Zealand arrangement, and see i f that will",31
NA,"be acceptable."" I n moving the second",31
NA,"reading he said, i n effect, "" I t may be",31
NA,"that this bill is the right step, but i",31
NA,"is not, God help you ! I n that event some",31
NA,"othor step must be taken, for the problem",31
NA,"must be solved."" According to the. right",31
NA,honorable gentleman the Government is,31
NA,merely experimenting with this bill. He,31
NA,is not sufficiently convinced of the virtues,31
NA,of his proposals to stand or fall by them.,31
NA,"But his colleague, the Treasurer, is",31
NA,"quite sure that the bill will do good, and",31
NA,"that i t "" represents the most important",31
NA,advance i n the butter industry since re-,31
NA,"frigeration has been commercialized.""",31
NA,The first necessity is for the Prime M i n,31
NA,ster and the Treasurer to consult together,31
NA,and make up their minds. The diver-,31
NA,gence of the opinions of the two leaders,31
NA,represents the attitude of the. Govern-,31
NA,ment towards the dairying industry. I f,31
NA,Ministers had made up their minds,31
NA,that this proposal would -be of real,31
NA,"value, they would not have proposed a",31
NA,"poll of the producers, but would have de-",31
NA,clared that i n the opinion of the Govern-,31
NA,ment the system of control here outlined,31
NA,is - necessary for the welfare of the,31
NA,industry. Have the Ministerial sup-,31
NA,porters made up their minds ? N o ;,31
NA,"they, too, are divided. For instance, the",31
NA,honorable member for Lilley ( Mr Mac-,31
NA,kay) said that the business-like course,31
NA,would have been to ascertain the opinion,31
NA,of the dairy farmers before introducing,31
NA,"the bill, and then, having introduced a",31
NA,measure that represented the views of the,31
NA,"industry, the Government should have",31
NA,been prepared to stand by i t . Are,31
NA,the people who are presumed,31
NA,be likely to benefit agreed as to,31
NA,the virtues of the bill? N o ; nor,31
NA,are those who are interested i n butter,31
NA,factories and i n the export trade. Be-,31
NA,"cause of the lack of unanimity, the Go-",31
NA,vernment proposes to take a poll of the,31
NA,producers i n order to ascertain whether,31
NA,they will have this scheme after i t has been,31
NA,embodied i n an act of Parliament!,31
NA,"I t is probable that, after Parliament has",31
NA,spent many days i n discussing the pro-,31
NA,"posal, the dairy farmers w i l l reject i t .",31
NA,There are three markets i n which our,31
NA,"butter is sold, and a number of selling",31
NA,agencies with conflicting interests. A,31
NA,large trade in butter has been built up,31
NA,i n the East. Some traders have estab-,31
NA,"lished interests i n China and Japan, and",31
NA,"i n Manila, and i n the Straits Settlements.",31
NA,A special class of export trade has been,31
NA,"developed, and those interested i n i t do",31
NA,not wish for the proposed control. For,31
NA,"f i t example, butter is exported to Java i n",31
NA,metal containers. Some of the traders,31
NA,consider that the bill would injure the,31
NA,"market i n the East for Australian butter,",31
NA,and they naturally do not want their,31
NA,trade controlled by a body that may,31
NA,have no knowledge of its requirements.,31
NA,"Besides, what justification is there",31
NA,for allowing the dairy farmers to inter-,31
NA,fere with a trade of which they have,31
NA,no knowledge? AH that the dairymen,31
NA,"want is a good price f o r their butter, just",31
NA,as the workmen i n the cities are anxious,31
NA,i - to secure sufficient wages to enable them,31
NA,to live comfortably. I t may be said that,31
NA,many dairymen have paid too dearly f o r,31
NA,"their land, and that their interest bill is",31
NA,too high. That is a matter which will,31
NA,have to be dealt with i n some other way.,31
NA,"Like the workmen i n the cities, the",31
NA,main requirement of the dairy farmers,31
NA,is a fair and adequate return for,31
NA,their labour. They certainly have no,31
NA,"knowledge of the Eastern trade, and the",31
NA,bill makes no provision to meet the special,31
NA,needs of that trade. The dairy farmers,31
NA,"do not understand the selling of butter,",31
NA,but Parliament should make itself,31
NA,familiar with the needs of the' trade on,31
NA,"the selling side. Therefore, there are",31
NA,two or three aspects from which this sub-,31
NA,ject is to be considered. The Eastern,31
NA,"trade, as I have indicated, is different",31
NA,"from the European trade, and any inter-",31
NA,ference by those who do not understand i t,31
NA,will have an injurious effect on the in-,31
NA,"dustry, to the detriment of the producers.",31
NA,"to Then, again, the co-operative butter fac-",31
NA,"tories are divided into two sections, one of",31
NA,which sells direct to companies known as,31
NA,co-operative export companies that mainly,31
NA,"trade i n overseas consignments, and the",31
NA,other sells to agents who deal on an f.o.b.,31
NA,"basis. I t is obvious, then, that producers",31
NA,and the sellers differ as to the value of the,31
NA,"bill. The 150,000 men and women en-",31
NA,gaged i n the dairying industry are,31
NA,at a loss -to -know whether,32
NA,".best o-esults .are to"" be obtained",32
NA,"dealing with those who sell f.,o.b. or",32
NA,with those who make,32
NA,direct to London. It seems to me to be,32
NA,self-evident sthat the f.o.b. buyers must be,32
NA,"excluded from the operations of the bill,",32
NA,otherwise injury will be inflicted on that,32
NA,branch 6f the trade. We are told that,32
NA,the measure has been drafted on the .lines,32
NA,"-of the New .Zealand act, but I point out",32
NA,"that that measure has become, to a certain",32
NA,"extent, a -dead let'ter. In New Zealand",32
NA,there is no interference with the 'f.o.b.,32
NA,"trade,- because it has been found that the",32
NA,measure can only be applied,32
NA,the detriment of that trade.,32
NA,"can Australia, -with its",32
NA,"tively small production,",32
NA,"have any considerable influence, on the",32
NA,butter markets of the world ? The Prime,32
NA,Minister and his supporters are not in,32
NA,agreement even on that point.,32
NA,"no more about butter than I do, the",32
NA,Prime Minister can only be guided by,32
NA,"tbe advice furnished to him., and he is of",32
NA,the opinion that there may be some possi-,32
NA,bility of regulating the supplies,32
NA,t> London from Australia.,32
NA,the Prime Minister has accepted the ad-,32
NA,vice tendered to him that there must be,32
NA,some regulation of the supplies reaching,32
NA,"Great Britain, his supporters are not in",32
NA,agreement on the matter. The honorable,32
NA,NA,32
NA,"example, does not think that the supplies",32
NA,could be regulated. He remarked that it,32
NA,would be unwise to market,32
NA,butter in the period favorable to Euro-,32
NA,pean production. Other honorable mem-,32
NA,bers hoi4 a different view. The very per-,32
NA,sons who are advising the,32
NA,"being divided on the subject, how can the",32
NA,dairymen be expected to judge?,32
NA,synopsis of the case should be prepared.,32
NA,If the Government deems it advisable to,32
NA,"take a referendum, it should be fortified",32
NA,by a definite opinion formed as the result,32
NA,"of expert advice. Personally, I regard",32
NA,the measure as a gigantic failure.,32
NA,not think it will be of any particular,32
NA,"value to those whom it professes to serve,",32
NA,and I am convinced that the Prime Min-,32
NA,"ister, in his private investigation",32
NA,"subject, has formed a similar opinion.",32
NA,"has endeavoured to hide his doubt, but he",32
NA,admits that the utility of the bill is open,32
NA,"to question. Evidently, Ministers .are",32
NA,"leaping in the dark, and since there",32
NA,is a great conflict of,32
NA,Mr Anstey.,32
NA,the iand no .agreement can be arrived,32
NA,"from at, the committee -should be careful",32
NA,that i t .does not pass a b i l l that w i l l do,32
NA,.consignments -more -harm than good. Before discussing,32
NA,the matter i n this .chamber the proposal,32
NA,should have been referred to those -en-,32
NA,gaged i n the industry. There should,32
NA,"have , been a campaign, and the views of",32
NA,the various interests should have been,32
NA,made known and discussed i n all dis-,32
NA,tricts. As a result of that discussion i n,32
NA,the country the Government should have,32
NA,"formed a definite opinion, ,and .brought",32
NA,down a concrete proposal that would be,32
NA,to of value. I realize that the b i l l w i l l be,32
NA,"How passed, because the Government has a",32
NA,.compara- majority. Honorable members .on this,32
NA,hope to side of the chamber regard i t as the,32
NA,greatest delusion ever sought to be,32
NA,"imposed upon a great body of (producers,",32
NA,"who, I am sure, will be disappointed. I t",32
NA,Knowing will 'be foun d necessary to go over the,32
NA,whole ground again and t r y to seek a,32
NA,"-solution,",32
NA,. MT . CORSER (Wide Bay ) {5.40] -,32
NA,This subject has been discussed,32
NA,sent,32
NA,Although by dairymen throughout Australia,32
NA,"for six months, and surely they",32
NA,should know what is required. Although,32
NA,"the measure does not go so f a r as fchey,",32
NA,"and I , think i t should, I prefer half a",32
NA,loaf to no bread. The dairymen of,32
NA,Queensland' and New South Wales are,32
NA,well informed as to the needs of the i n -,32
NA,"dustry, and they have already expressed",32
NA,Australian their views. What is the use of the,32
NA,representatives i n this House i f they do,32
NA,not know how to protect the interests of,32
NA,their constituents? The desire of the,32
NA,Government- dairymen throughout Queensland and,32
NA,NeAV South Wales is that the measure,32
NA,A shall be passed as .soon as possible. Why,32
NA,"should their wishes be thwarted by, per-",32
NA,"haps, two or three factories i n Victoria",32
NA,"that may be large dealers i n butter, but",32
NA,are not {particularly interested i n -the,32
NA,welfare of the producers? No time,32
NA,I do should be lost. To take a poll over such,32
NA,.an enormous area as that devoted to,32
NA,dairying would mean & considerable loss,32
NA,of time and -money. I have received a,32
NA,of the telegram i n the following terms.:-,32
NA,He Meeting Gympie representative -thirty centres,32

NA,port and assistance ^passage bill giving ade-,32
NA,quate assistance to dairying industry during,32
NA,present session.,32
NA,"interests, I have had a large number of telegrams",32
NA,and letters containing similar requests.,32
NA,We should not ask the dairymen to come,33
NA,to a decision on aquestion that has,33
NA,already been emphatically answered by,33
NA,them.,33
Mr FENTON ,The y have not done,33
NA,"that. ""They decided on the first scheme,",33
NA,but not on this.,33
NA,"Mr CORSER, -Th e dairymen have",33
NA,been f u l l y informed of what has taken,33
NA,"place, and they know that the other",33
NA,scheme was turned down a long while ago,33
NA,because i t was unconstitutional. For,33
NA,some time we have been endeavouring,33
NA,to decide upon means to give them relief.,33
NA,They are aware of the nature of this,33
NA,"scheme. Why, then, should i t be rezations",33
NA,ferred back to them for an expression,33
NA,opinion ?,33
Mr FENTON ,Hav e they seen a copy,33

Mr CORSER , I do not say that they,33

NA,also refreshing to find on this side of the,33
NA,chamber so many staunch supporters of a,33
NA,the amendment moved by the honorable of,33
NA,member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde).,33
NA,For a considerable time during the,33
NA,speech of the Acting Leader of the,33
NA,"Opposition ( Mr Anstey), I was un-",33
NA,able to determine upon which,33
NA,he intended to range himself.,33
NA,lieve that the best argument advanced,33
NA,this afternoon was that of the honorable,33
NA,member for Lilley ( Mr Mackay). The,33
NA,dairymen will be in a better position,33
NA,decide upon what they want after,33
NA,measure has been sufficiently long ' in,33
NA,operation to enable them to judge of,33
NA,worth. At present the average dairyman,33
NA,cannot say whether or not this scheme,33
NA,meets his wishes. I shall support,33
NA,amendment.,33
NA,[183],33
Mr WEST ,East Sydney) [5.49] -I t,33
NA,would be as nauseous to me to support,33
NA,either the proposal of the honorable mem-,33
NA,"ber for Richmond ( Mr R. Green), or",33
NA,that of the honorable member for Capri-,33
NA,"cornia ( Mr Forde), as i t would to take",33
NA,"a dose of castor oil."" The proposal of the",33
NA,"Government is to issue a proclamation,",33
NA,but before that proclamation can have,33
NA,any effect a vote of those interested in,33
NA,the dairying industry must be taken. The,33
NA,amendment provides that a period of two,33
NA,years shall elapse before that vote is,33
NA,taken. I do not understand the logic of,33
NA,those who are favorable to that course.,33
NA,A conference of the Country party organi-,33
NA,is to be held i n Melbourne this,33
NA,of week. The representatives at that confer-,33
NA,ence will decide the fate bf the Composite.,33
NA,Government. That may be the reason for,33
NA,the desire of some honorable members to,33
NA,"delay this matter. I t does not, however,",33
NA,"are, prevent other honorable members from",33
NA,standing up for the principles that they,33
NA,espouse. The amendment does not - con-,33
NA,"tain any principle, unless i t be the desire",33
NA,to involve the Government i n expendi-,33
NA,and make i t bear the responsibility,33
NA,for any failure that may result. A t a,33
NA,"public dinner yesterday, and I believe at",33
NA,"a meeting of his party to-day, the Prime",33
NA,far Minister ( Mr Bruce) spoke strongly,33
NA,t will about the blackmailing methods being,33
NA,t is put adopted by a new party. This is what,33
The CHAIRMAN ,Hon. F. W. Bam-,33
NA,- I ask the honorable member to,33
NA,confine himself to the amendment.,33
Mr WEST , I want to show what the,33
NA,Prime Minister's motive is. He said-,33
NA,New parties spring up and do not hesitate,33
NA,to admit frankly that their object is to obtain,33
NA,position in which they will hold the balance,33
NA,"power, and gain their end by a species of",33
NA,political blackmail.,33
The CHAIRMAN , T h e honorable,33
NA,member is distinctly out of order.,33
Mr WEST , I cannot suggest any,33
NA,side new party except that comprising honor-,33
NA,I beable members who sit i n the corner oppo-,33
NA,site. I honestly admit that I do not like,33
NA,"voting with the Government, but as i t",33
NA,appears to me that the principle of go-,33
NA,to vernment by the people is being attacked,33
NA,"the by the amendment, I shall have to con-",33
NA,sider what action i t w i l l be best f o r me to,33
NA,its take. I advise the mover of the amend-,33
NA,ment to withdraw i t . I t cannot be sup-,33
NA,ported by either honorable members oppo-,33
NA,the site or the true democrats who sit on this,33
NA,side of the chamber.,33
NA,Mr M. CAMERON (Barker) [5.54] -,34
NA,During the last four or five months this,34
NA,matter has been before the House i n one,34
NA,form or another. Although the scheme has,34
NA,"undergone alteration, the opinion pf the",34
NA,primary producers has not changed. They,34
NA,favour proceeding with the measure as,34
NA,rapidly as possible. The Acting Leader,34
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey) a few,34
NA,"minutes ago proved conclusively, that the",34
NA,scheme should be put into operation with-,34
NA,out the taking of a poll. He said that,34
NA,it was absolutely impossible for the. pri-,34
NA,"mary producers to understand i t , par-",34
NA,ticularly in its relation to marketing. I f,34
NA,"the honorable member, with his usual",34
NA,"eloquence, can persuade those who are en-",34
NA,gaged in the dairying industry that this,34
NA,"proposal is a snare and a delusion, the",34
NA,dairymen may be induced to vote against,34
NA,"it, but I have no hesitation in saying that",34
NA,the dairymen are satisfied that a measure,34
NA,of this character will be in their interests.,34
NA,I have not heard one word of objection to,34
NA,"it, but I have had hundreds of communi-",34
NA,cations from both individual dairymen,34
NA,and dairying associations urging support,34
NA,of the scheme. When the measure had,34
NA,"beeu in operation for two years, a vote",34
NA,of the dairymen would show whether they,34
NA,were in favour of it or opposed to it.,34
NA,NA,34
NA,wrong with letting them pronounce upon,34
NA,it now?,34
NA,Mr M . CAMERON -W e shall soon,34
NA,be in the middle of the ex-,34
NA,port season. Although the Prime,34
NA,Minister has assured us that the,34
NA,"vote could be taken within a month,",34
NA,our experience proves that it would b'e,34
NA,a miracle i f the department handling the,34
NA,matter were to move at such a pace. I,34
NA,can see no reason for declining to pro-,34
NA,ceed along the lines indicated by the,34
NA,"amendment, and I intend to support it.",34
Mr GABB ,Angas) [5.58] - I shall,34
NA,"support the amendment. I recognize, of",34
NA,"course, that by assisting to defer the",34
NA,"operation of the poll, I shall lay myself",34
NA,open to charges by honorable members on,34
NA,"this side. Still, we should not deny to",34
NA,the primary producer the right to a poll;,34
NA,the matter would merely be deferred for,34
NA,"two years. Until now, the only opinion",34
NA,I have heard from dairymen and from,34
NA,dairying organizations in my district is,34
NA,that the poll should be taken two years,34
NA,hence. I do not wish to delay in any,34
NA,way the exportation of butter under this,34
NA,"scheme. I am satisfied that, whether the",34
NA,poll is taken immediately or two years,34
NA,"hence, the dairymen of Australia will",34
NA,carry it. I want them to have experience,34
NA,"of the scheme, because I believe that that",34
NA,will influence them to support it. I can-,34
NA,not agree with the contention that this,34
NA,bill is of no use. We could wish for a,34
NA,"measure of greater usefulness, but at the",34
NA,same time this will assist to control the,34
NA,export of butter and cheese from Aus-,34
NA,tralia.,34
Mr MACKAY ,Lilley) [5.59] -W e,34
NA,"frequently find, as the result of litiga-",34
NA,"tion, that acts of Parliament can be read",34
NA,in many different ways. I should like,34
NA,the Prime Minister to indicate whether,34
NA,the regulations that are to be made could,34
NA,"in any way affect the proviso, which",34
NA,reads-,34
NA,Provided that a proclamation under tliis,34
NA,section shall not issue unless and until at,34
NA,a poll of' producers taken in the prescribed,34
NA,"manner throughout the Commonwealth, a",34
NA,majority of votes have been given i n favour,34
NA,of the act being brought into operation.,34
NA,"Does ""majority"" mean a bare majority?",34
NA,Could the regulations qualify that provi-,34
NA,sion in any way? We are accustomed to,34
NA,differences of opinion amongst primary,34
NA,"producers. Frequently, because of mis-",34
NA,understanding and misrepresentation they,34
NA,do not work as unitedly as we could,34
NA,"wish, and in this matter a big",34
NA,majority should not be asked for.,34
Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [6.0] - I am,34
NA,not opposed to a poll of the producers,34
NA,"being taken, but I am concerned about",34
NA,the time when i t shall be taken. The,34
NA,dairymen of Australia are clamouring for,34
NA,"a bill on the lines of the one before us,",34
NA,and although this does not give them,34
NA,"nearly all they want, nor does it provide",34
NA,"all that I want them to get, it is a step",34
NA,in the right direction.,34
Mr FENTON , A very small step.,34
Mr FORDE ,"Yes , it falls far short,",34
NA,"of what I desire, for i t takes into account",34
NA,only one phase of marketing dairy pro-,34
NA,duce. Instead of spending so much time,34
NA,on a bill that deals with the export trade,34
NA,"only, we should bo considering a measure",34
NA,that would deal with the industry in a,34
NA,national way. I t is because I hold that,34
NA,belief that I moved a few days ago to,34
NA,reduce the proposed vote on the Esti-,34
NA,mates of tho Prime Minister's Depart-,34
NA,ment by £ 1 as an instruction to the Go-,34
NA,vernment to provide a comprehensive,34
NA,scheme for marketing the dairy produce,35
NA,of Australia both at home and abroad.,35
NA,The honorable member for Wide Bay,35
NA,( Mr Corser) said some very nasty things,35
NA,"about me for moving that amendment,",35
NA,and said that I was jeopardizing,35
NA,the passage of this bill.,35
NA,mit that that was an entirely wrong,35
NA,view of the matter. I am supporting the,35
NA,"bill, and have no desire whatever to",35
NA,"wreck i t , as he suggested. Why not let",35
NA,us vote on the matter immediately ? We,35
NA,are elected to this Parliament to repre-,35
NA,"sent the people i n our constituencies, and",35
NA,surely we are able to say what they want,35
NA,Did the Government propose to submit to,35
NA,a poll of the taxpayers the Land Tax,35
NA,Amendment B i l l i t introduced Some time,35
NA,ago to relieve the wealthy pastoralists of,35
NA,"the payment of £ 1 , 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . taxation",35
NA,that they owed? D i d i t propose to,35
NA,refer to the boy scouts tlie Boy Scouts As-,35
NA,sociation B i l l which we have just passed ?,35
NA,Did i t propose to refer to the people the,35
NA,Bankruptcy B i l l which was before us a,35
NA,few days ago ? There is no more need to,35
NA,refer this bill to the people than there,35
NA,was to refer to them the measures I have,35
NA,just mentioned. I t is the first time I,35
NA,have heard of a proposal that a bill of,35
NA,this character should be referred to the,35
NA,people concerned for their approval or,35
NA,otherwise after i t had been passed by Par-,35
NA,liament. A conference of the Nationalist,35
NA,party is sitting i n Melbourne. W i l l de-,35
NA,cisions of that conference be submitted,35
NA,to the rank and file of Nationalist sup-,35
NA,porters outside?,35
Mr MCGRATH ,Ther e are no Nation-,35
NA,alist supporters outside.,35
Mr FORDE , I admit that the num-;,35
NA,"ber is decreasing rapidly, and that the",35
NA,principal supporters of the party are those,35
NA,whom i t pays to advocate its views. B u t,35
NA,leb us take another example.,35
NA,cisions of a Labour party conference are,35
NA,not submitted to the rank and file of the,35
NA,party for confirmation. The delegates ac-,35
NA,cept f u l l responsibility for dealing with,35
NA,the agenda-paper. I submit that we,35
NA,should accept the responsibility which has,35
NA,"been placed upon us, and decide this mat-",35
NA,ter definitely. As the Acting Leader of,35
NA,"the Opposition has said, the Government",35
NA,"does not know what i t wants, and i t pre-",35
NA,tends not to know what the dairy pro-,35
NA,"ducers want. Perhaps, two telegrams",35
NA,which I have just received will help i t to,35
NA,realize that the dairy farmers want the,35
NA,provisions of this bill put into operation,35
NA,as rapidly as possible. I received the fol-,35
NA,"lowing telegram from. Mr Brownlie, the",35
NA,executive officer of the dairymen of the,35
NA,"Columboola district, i n the Maranoa elec-",35
NA,torate:-,35
NA,Congratulations on behalf of Columboola,35
NA,producers; we appreciate your efforts re,35
NA,I sub- stabilizing; rest assured dairymen behind you,35
NA,"in obtaining return to farmers, based on cost",35
NA,of production.,35
NA,That is what I am strenuously fighting,35
NA,for. The marketing of the exportable,35
NA,surplus of butter is only a phase of the,35
NA,matter. I received another telegram,35
NA,"from Pialba, i n the electorate of the",35
NA,honorable member for Wide Bay. It,35
NA,reads as follows : -,35
NA,Meeting Gympie representative thirty centres,35
NA,"over two thousand dairymen urgently request,",35
NA,your support and assistance passage bill giv-,35
NA,ing adequate assistance to dairy industry dur-,35
NA,ing present session.,35
NA,"WHEATIEY, Secretary.",35
Mr CORSER , I read that telegram,35
NA,a few minutes ago.,35
Mr FORDE ,The n that is an added,35
NA,reason why the honorable member should,35
NA,urge the Government which he is sup-,35
NA,porting to agree to what I am proposing.,35
NA,The dairy farmers desire that this mea-,35
NA,sure shall be put into operation i n time,35
NA,for the fast approaching export season.,35
Mr BRUCE ,Th e honorable member is,35
NA,causing delay now.,35
Mr FORDE , I t is highly desirable,35
NA,that I should urge with all my power the,35
NA,acceptance of my proposal i n addition to,35
NA,that contained i n the bill. I f the pro-,35
NA,"visions of the bill are adhered to, con-",35
NA,siderable delay must occur. I t will take,35
NA,months to prepare and check rolls in,35
NA,order that the poll provided for i n the,35
NA,"bill may be held, to say nothing of the>",35
NA,"£2,000 i n cost that w i l l be involved,",35
NA,whereas i f my amendment were adopted:',35
NA,a provisional board could be appointed im-,35
NA,The demediately by the various co-operative and,35
NA,proprietary companies concerned in the,35
NA,"export of butter, and i t could put the",35
NA,scheme into operation forthwith. The,35
NA,board could carry on for approximately,35
NA,"23 months, and the dairymen would then",35
NA,be i n a position to decide by the taking,35
NA,of a poll whether the scheme was worth,35
NA,retaining or not. I t would be f a r better,35
NA,"to adopt that course, f o r i t would permit",35
NA,the case f o r the scheme to be put f u l l y,35
NA,and clearly to the producers. I f a poll,35
NA,were taken at this inopportune time many,35
NA,producers would not know where they,35
NA,stood. Additional arguments i n favour,35
NA,of deferring the taking of a poll f o r two,35
NA,years axethat in the meantime the pre-,36
NA,liminary organizing workwould' have,36
NA,been done; the provisional hoard would,36
NA,have been able to send an ofhcer toLon-,36
NA,don to investigate the marketing condi-,36
NA,"tions there, and submit a report, and the",36
NA,supporters of the scheme would have had,36
NA,time to prove that those who are now ad-,36
NA,vising delay are chiefly interested i n,36
NA,assisting the speculators^ who have been,36
NA,"bleeding, the dairy producers for so",36
NA,to retain their position. As the co-opera-,36
NA,tors would have a majority on the provi-,36
NA,sional board I submit that there is every-,36
NA,thing to gain and nothing' to loseby,36
NA,"appointing it immediately, and deferring",36
NA,the taking of a poll as I have suggested.,36
Mr A GREEN ,Kalgoorlie) [6.11] -,36
NA,I oppose the amendment for the reason,36
NA,"that I think the dairy producers, who are",36
NA,"the parties most interested, should be",36
NA,given an opportunity to say whether this,36
NA,scheme is to become operative or not. I,36
NA,have no doubt whatever that they will re-,36
NA,ject it i f they are given the opportunity,36
NA,to do so. Many of the so-called co-,36
NA,operative societies which are interested,36
NA,the success of this proposition are co-,36
NA,"operative only in name, and others of",36
NA,them are in the position of a certain big,36
NA,so-called co-operative company in Syd-,36
NA,"ney, the name of which I will not men-",36
NA,"tion, which is really a joint stock com-",36
NA,pany. I t is true that the owners of the,36
NA,dairy produce which that company mar-,36
NA,"kets are shareholders i n the company, but",36
NA,other shareholders are interested in other,36
NA,"products. The company handles eggs,",36
NA,"bacon, dressed poultry, and a dozen other",36
NA,"products. ""What does the bacon-curer",36
NA,care about the interests of the butter,36
NA,man ? All he is interested in is obtaining,36
NA,the highest price possible for the butter,36
NA,sold in Australia. We are told that the,36
NA,export scheme proposed in this bill will,36
NA,"stabilize the butter market, but when' one",36
NA,realizes that Australia supplies only 15,36
NA,"S er cent, of the butter requirements of",36
NA,"-reat Britain, it will be seen how im-",36
NA,possible it is for this scheme to stabilize,36
NA,the industry. The suggestion that by,36
NA,"forwarding our butter on consignment,",36
NA,which I suppose is what this scheme,36
NA,"really means, we can stabilize the British",36
NA,"market, is not worth considering. I am",36
NA,favorable to the butter producers getting,36
NA,as much as they can for their products.,36
NA,Their great trouble is the over-capitali-,36
NA,"zation of. their land.. I . submit, that real",36
NA,cot-operative companies will reap no,36
NA,"benefit, from this measure; Let us take",36
NA,as' an illustration the Byron Bay Com-,36
NA,"pany,, which is the largest butter produc-",36
NA,ing concern! in the world. I&it represented,36
NA,in. the crowdof interested auditors: in,36
NA,the gallery of this chamber to-day? I t,36
NA,is not. But the so-called co-operative,36
NA,concerns are represented. The Byron,36
NA,"long, Bay Company early came to the con-",36
NA,clusion that the methods adopted by,36
NA,many so-called co-operative companies,36
NA,"were of no use to the producers, for the",36
NA,shareholders i n such companies drew,36
NA,thousands of pounds i n dividends from,36
NA,the sale of primary products for which,36
NA,they gave the .producers no adequate,36
NA,"return. The company, therefore, decided",36
NA,to be its own selling agent in both,36
NA,Australia and Great Britain. The board,36
NA,of ten will have upon i t six representa-,36
NA,tives of the co-operative factories. I t,36
NA,may delegate its authority to five mem-,36
NA,"bers, and the representatives of the co-",36
NA,operative factories are not likely to allow,36
NA,their interests to be prejudiced. With-,36
NA,"in out knowing, very much about the",36
NA,"business, I doubt, if this bill will help",36
NA,the dairymen of Australia. I know that,36
NA,the Prime Minister has received tele-,36
NA,grams from butter producers in different,36
NA,"parts of Australia, protesting against its",36
NA,provisions. We contend that the butter,36
NA,producers of Australia should have an,36
NA,"opportunity to decide, by a democratic",36
NA,"vote, whether the scheme shall be",36
NA,adopted.,36
Mr BRUCE ,Flinders-Prim e Minis-,36
NA,ter and Minister for External Affairs),36
NA,[6.16] - I have nodesire to delay the,36
NA,"committee, but I wish to clear up a doubt",36
NA,that has been raised by the honorable,36
NA,"member for Lilley ( Mr Mackay),' who",36
NA,"has asked whether "" majority,"" in the",36
NA,"proviso, means a bare majority. That is",36
NA,"what is contemplated. I trust, there-",36
NA,"fore, that the amendment of the honor-",36
NA,able member for Capricornia will not be,36
NA,pressed to a division. After the discus-,36
NA,sion i t is clear that there is a doubt,36
NA,whether those connected with the industry,36
NA,really desire the exportation of,36
NA,"dairy produce, defined in this bill",36
NA,"as including butter and cheese, to",36
NA,be controlled in the manner pro-,36
NA,posed. The only reason advanced why,36
NA,a poll should not be taken -is that i t,36
NA,would involve delay. I can assure hon-,36
NA,"orable, members, however, that immedi-",36
NA,ately the bill is passed the Government,36
NA,will take the necessary steps to ascertain,37
NA,"the opinions of .the producers, and .as the",37
NA,poll may he taken at,37
NA,tories supplied by,37
NA,should not be any appreciable delay.,37
Mr COOK , I t w i l l mean a delay of at,37
NA,least three months.,37
Mr BRUCE , I have already indi-,37
NA,"cated that as the word ""producers"" is",37
NA,denned as meaning all persons carrying,37
NA,on business as suppliers of milk or cream,37
NA,to factories manufacturing dairy produce,37
NA,"for export, i t might be responsible for",37
NA,"some delay, I , therefore, propose, when we",37
NA,"reach that definition, to strike out the*",37
NA,"words "" for export,"" so that all suppliers",37
NA,of milk or cream to factories shall be,37
NA,entitled to vote. Then the poll should,37
NA,not take long. I do not think there is,37
NA,any cause for apprehension that there will,37
NA,be delay likely to prejudice the success of,37
NA,"the scheme, or to prevent effect being.giv.en",37
NA,to i t immediately i n the event of a ma-,37
NA,jority of the producers deciding in favour,37
NA,of i t .,37
NA,Mr .CUNNINGHAM (Gwydir) [6.19].,37
NA,- I strongly 'support the amendment,37
NA,moved by the honorable member f o r Cap-,37
NA,"ricornia ( Mr Forde), f o r the reason that",37
NA,"i f , as is proposed in the clause, a vote",37
NA,"of the producers is taken immediately,",37
NA,they w i l l be voting on a scheme that w i l l,37
NA,"not have been put into operation, and of",37
NA,which they w i l l have had no experience.,37
NA,The intention of the Government to take,37
NA,the vote at once is a confession of its own,37
NA,"incompetence, and an indication of the",37
NA,f u t i l i t y of a composite ministry.,37
Mr MACKAY ," Why this "" stone-wall""",37
NA,of the bill ?,37
Mr CUNNINGHAM , T h i s is the,37
NA,"first occasion ;on which .1 have spoken,",37
NA,whereas the honorable member f o r Lilley,37
NA,"has spoken ,at least three .times. The Go-",37
NA,vernment should stand up to its responsi-,37
NA,bility. I t is Sin insult to honorable mem-,37
NA,bers to take up the time .of this 'commit-,37
NA,tee with a measure about which .even the,37
NA,Prime Minister and 'his co-leader are not,37
NA,in agreement. Gertainly there is no -un-,37
NA,animity amongst their supporters. I f,37
NA,legal members of the profession i n this,37
NA,chamber cannot agree as to the interpre-,37
NA,"tation of certain clauses in the bill, what",37
NA,possible chance has a layman to satisfy,37
NA,himself as to their -meaning ? A vote -of,37
NA,the producers will play into the hands,37
NA,of the shareholders of many so-called co-,37
NA,"operative societies which are, in effect,",37
NA,joint-stock companies. We should .con-,37
NA,sider the man who .supplies m i l k or cream,37
NA,the fac- to the factory. I f a ' vote is taken now,37
NA,"them, there there is n o provision f o r another vote lat",37
NA,some future time. The producers .are not,37
NA,"in a position, without having had experi-",37
NA,"ence tof the scheme i n -operation, t o say",37
NA,whebher the proposed board of control,37
NA,should be appointed. The measure is,37
NA,designed to interfere -with the law of,37
NA,"supply and demand. Denmark, which is",37
NA,"the largest supplier of the British market,",37
NA,has built up her reputation and consoli-,37
NA,dated her position i n the T3ritish market,37
NA,without resorting to this expedient. The,37
NA,Farmer and Dairyman referring to this,37
NA,matter states that the practice of,37
NA,Denmark is to sell its butter week,37
NA,"by week, irrespective of the condition of",37
NA,the market. There is no carry-over from,37
NA,"one week to another, with the result that",37
NA,British consumers know that Danish but-,37
NA,ter is always fresh. These gentlemen who,37
NA,preach the doctrine of no interference,37
NA,with private enterprise or with the law of,37
NA,supply and demand; who do not believe,37
NA,in the -artificial regulation of wages by,37
NA,"means of arbitration awards, now",37
NA,"declare that, by means of this b i l l ,",37
NA,the Government w i l l regulate the supply,37
NA,of Australian butter to the British,37
NA,"market, with the object of stabilizing",37
NA,"prices, presumably, on the latter market.",37
NA,How can this be possible since Australia,37
NA,supplies only 1 l b . of every 8 l b . that is,37
NA,consumed i n Great Britain? A n im-,37
NA,portant factor i n the consumption o'f,37
NA,butter is the condition i n which i t is mar-,37
NA,keted. I n this respect Australia is at a dis-,37
NA,"advantage. Great Britain supplies herself,",37
NA,:,37
NA,with approximately one-half of her home,37
NA,"requirements, and Denmark, as all hon-",37
NA,"orable members know, has built up an",37
NA,extensive and highly remunerative busi-,37
NA,ness with the British consumer. The fol-,37
NA,lowing table of imports of butter to the,37
NA,United Kingdom for 1923 indicates that,37
NA,country's .sources of supply:-,37

NA,"in lieu thereof the words "" if GO per cent,",39
NA,"the producers voting vote.""",39
Mr BRUCE ,"O n a point of order,",39
NA,"suggest that the honorable member's also,",39
NA,"amendment cannot be accepted, because",39
NA,the committee has just decided that,39
NA,words which he proposes to omit shall,39
NA,8Land part of the clause.,39
Mr DUNCAN,HUGHES -O n the,39
NA,"of order, I submit that as the-Chairman",39
NA,was prepared to consider the amendment,39
NA,of which notice was given by the honormind,39
NA,able member for Richmond ( Mr R.,39
NA,"Green), he should be prepared also to",39
NA,consider my amendment.,39
The CHAIRMAN , T h e honorable,39

NA,cided shall stand part of the clause.,39
Mr ANSTEY ,Le t the honorable mem-,39

Mr DUNCAN , HUGHES - I move-,39
NA,That the following words be added to the brought into operation or not.,39
NA,"clause : - "" such a majority to consist of not",39
NA,less than sixty per centum of the producers,39
NA,"voting.""",39
NA,I am very loth to let -this matter go,39
NA,without any discussion because i t emis,39
NA,bodies a principle which is contained i n,39
NA,"bills to be subsequently censidered,",39
NA,of which has already been presented.,39
NA,suggest that this is a convenient time,39
NA,decide the principle which is to be,39
NA,adopted in connexion with these majoriwho,39
NA,ties. I n the course of his speech the,39
NA,Prime Minister emphasized the fact that,39
NA,it is the producers who are concerned,39
NA,this marter and not the Australian,39
NA,"sumers, because this bill refers only",39
NA,"the export of dairy produce. There sideration,",39
NA,seems to be considerable doubt as to,39
NA,whether the persons who are chiefly con-,39
NA,The,39
NA,to perhonorable member for Macquarie ( Mr.,39
NA,howManning) and the Prime Minister have,39
NA,admitted that - they are not sure that a,39
NA,of the producers are i n favour of,39
NA,"the measure as i t stands, and the latter also",39
NA,"stated that "" convincing evidence """,39
NA,know should be brought forward that they,39
NA,I sug-,39
NA,n his gest that the minority have some,39
NA,"of rights, and that those rights should be",39
NA,"i n some way, particularly i n",39
NA,now view of the fact that government control,39
NA,is to apply on the side of the majority.,39
NA,I t may be suggested that anything over,39
NA,"50 per cent, is a democratic majority,",39
NA,but I submit that i t is not invariably so.,39
NA,have I t is well known that the rules of many,39
NA,societies provide that in matters of special,39
NA,"of importance, a majorit y greater than an",39
NA,absolute majorit y is necessary to carry,39
NA,1 a motion. Honorable members know,39
NA,that i n the case of public companies,39
NA,the voting powers of shareholders are de-,39
NA,the termined by the number of shares they,39
NA,"hold, and not by the number of share-",39
NA,holders. There may be a relatively small,39
NA,point number of shareholders who hold a,39
NA,"majorit y of the shares, and who, there-",39
NA,"fore, have a majority of the votes. I re-",39
NA,honorable members that the Federal,39
NA,"Constitution itself, which is perhaps the",39
NA,"most democratic i n the world, contains",39
NA,"a - section which provides that, before an",39
NA,"alteration of that constitution is effected,",39
NA,not only must there be a majority of the,39
NA,electors of the Commonwealth i n favour,39
NA,"of i t , but also a majority of the states.",39
NA,The reference to the producers is a rather,39
NA,unusual course to adopt i n order to,39
NA,decide whether this legislation shall be,39
NA,Person-,39
NA,"ally, I think that three-fourths of the",39
NA,producers should signify their acceptance,39
NA,of the Government's proposals before effect,39
NA,"given to them, but the feeling generally",39
NA,"is that 60 per cent, is a fairer proportion;",39
NA,one no one can say that that is unreason-,39
NA,I able. I do not think that there is any-,39
NA,to thing in my amendment which should-be,39
NA,objectionable to those honorable members,39
NA,are i n favour of the bill. As we are,39
NA,given to understand that a majority of the,39
NA,"producers is in favour of these proposals,",39
NA,i n my amendment provides a safeguard,39
NA,conwhich may not be necessary. I ask hon-,39
NA,to orable members to give i t careful con-,39
NA,especially as i t is proposed that,39
NA,this principle shall apply not only to this,40
NA,"particular industry, but also to other in-",40
NA,dustries. I t seems to me that i t would be,40
NA,Unwise to bring about such a drastic,40
NA,change by a bare majority of the votes,40
NA,cast.,40
Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [8.35] - I,40
NA,hope that the Government will not be per-,40
NA,suaded by the eloquence of the honorable,40
NA,member for Boothby ( Mr Duncan-,40
NA,Hughes) to accept his amendment. I t is,40
NA,contrary to the voting systems in opera-,40
NA,tion in the states in connexion with various,40
NA,5 obis. I cannot understand any man who,40
NA,esires to see this bill placed on the,40
NA,"statute-book, and who professes to act in",40
NA,the interests of the dairy farmers of Aus-,40
NA,"tralia, introducing an amendment of this",40
NA,"nature, insisting on a 60 per cent.",40
NA,I t is evident that the nationalist,40
NA,member for Boothby is voicing the,40
NA,opinions of other honorable members on,40
NA,his side of the House.,40

The CHAIRMAN ,Hon. F. W. Bam-,40

NA,division. The question now before the,40
NA,"Chair is that clause 2 be agreed to, and",40
NA,under the Standing Orders i t must be,40
NA,put forthwith.,40
Mr ANSTEY ,Immediatel y after the,40
NA,amendment by the honorable member for,40
NA,"Capricornia had been disposed of, I asked",40
NA,"you, Mr Chairman, i f the clause should",40
NA,"be put i n its entirety, and you decided to",40
NA,the contrary. I said that your ruling was,40
NA,"perfectly satisfactory to me; but now,",40
NA,apparently owing to the intervention of,40
NA,"24 the Prime Minister, you propose to re-",40
NA,21 verse your previous decision.,40
The CHAIRMAN , The standing,40
NA,Majority order governing the matter is as,40
NA,follows:-,40
NA,AYES.,40
NA,"When the motion "" That the question be now",40
NA,"p u t "" has been carried, and the question con-",40
NA,"sequent thereon has been decided, any further",40

NA,Minister.,41
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e honorable,41
NA,member mu3t withdraw the expression,41
NA,""" puppet.""",41
Mr ANSTEY , I mean no offence. I t,41
NA,is merely one of my ways of drawing,41
NA,attention to an odious situation. You,41
NA,would not accept my instructions as to,41
NA,how you should carry on.,41
The CHAIRMAN , I object to the,41

Mr ANSTEY ," I withdraw i t , with a",41

Mr SCULLIN ,Ha s the amendment,41

The CHAIRMAN ,Yes .,41
Mr SCULLIN ,Th e honorable member,41

Mr DUNCAN,"HUGHES - I voted "" aye """,41
NA,"and called for a division, and I heard",41

Mr LATHAM ," I voted ""aye"" and",41

The CHAIRMAN ,A s there has evi-,41

Mr SCULLIN ,No w that the honor-,41

NA,"has been disposed of, I take i t that clause",41

The CHAIRMAN ,Th e clause can be,41
NA,debated.,41
Mr BRUCE , I submit that when the,41
NA,"motion "" That the question be now p u t """,41
NA,has been carried i t covers not only any,41
NA,amendment which may have been moved,41
NA,"to the question originally stated, but also",41
NA,the original question itself. The question,41
NA,"originally stated was "" That clause 2 be",41
NA,"agreed to."" On this certain amendments",41
NA,"have been moved. The motion "" That the",41
NA,"question be now put"" having been carried,",41
NA,I submit that i t covers not only any,41
NA,"amendment on the clause, but also the",41
NA,clause itself.,41
Mr OKEEFE ,"O n the point of order,-",41
NA,I submit that i f the contention of the,41
NA,"Prime Minister is agreed to, the com-",41
NA,mittee will be placed in an absurd posi-,41
NA,tion. I cannot understand the Leader of,41
NA,the House contending that the motion,41
NA,""" That the question be now p u t "" covers,",41
NA,"not only the amendment, but also the",41
NA,"original question, "" That the clause be",41
NA,"agreed to."" The question "" That the",41
NA,"question be now p u t "" covers only the",41
NA,amendment immediately before the com-,41
NA,"mittee. I f that were not so, then the",41
NA,closure having been applied as soon as-,41
NA,"an amendment to"" a clause had been sub-",41
NA,"mitted, no other amendment, however",41
NA,"important, could be submitted.",41
Mr BRUCE ,Tha t is what the stand-,41
NA,ing order provides.,41
Mr FENTON ,Th e Chairman has,41
NA,ruled that clause 2 is now open for dis-,41
NA,cussion. The only way in which the,41
NA,Prime Minister or any other member can,41
NA,proceed to upset that ruling is to move,41
NA,that the Chairman's ruling be disagreed,41
NA,"with. I understand that you, Mr Chair-",41
NA,"man, now rule that clause 2 is open for",41
NA,debate.,41
The CHAIRMAN ,Le t me call the,41
NA,attention of the committee to a ruling,41
NA,given on this point by Mr Speaker John-,41
NA,"son on the 20th September, 1922-",41
NA,"When a motion has been agreed to, ""That",41
NA,"the question be now put,"" it embraces not only",41
NA,"any amendment before the Chair, but all steps",41
NA,necessary to bring tlie main question to a con-,41
NA,clusion. That .is provided for in the Standing,41
NA,"Orders; and, for that reason, honorable mem-",41
NA,bers are now called upon to vote upon the,41
NA,"question, "" That the Bill be now read a third",41
NA,"time.""",41
Mr SCULLIN ,D o I understand that,41
NA,in consequence of a bad ruling given,41
NA,by an ex-Speaker you now propose to go,41
NA,back on your own ruling?,41
The CHAIRMAN , I .now rule that,41
NA,clause 2 must be put. forthwith with-,41
NA,out debate.,41
Mr ANSTEY , I am afraid that we,41
NA,must take action to upset that ruling.,41
NA,I place no reliance upon any ruling by,41
NA,"the former Speaker, Sir Elliot Johnson.",41
NA,"He decided, on occasions, that the Stand-",41
NA,"ing Orders were adequate, and when they",41
NA,were not adequate he relied upon his own,41
NA,"judgment. He referred to May, when i t",41
NA,"suited him so to do, and his decisions were",41
NA,of no value. We must refer this matter,41
NA,"to the - Speaker, -so that we may have a",41
NA,definite decision.,41
Mr BRUCE , I suggest that i f the Act-,42
NA,ing Leader of the Opposition disagrees,42
NA,with the Chairman's ruline. he must sub-,42
NA,"mit his objection i n writing, and the mat-",42
NA,ter niust be decided forthwith.,42
NA,Mr . ANSTEY - I did not object to the,42
NA,Chairman's original r u l i n g ; I accepted i t .,42
NA,The objection came from the Prime M i n -,42
NA,"ister, and he should have taken the course",42
NA,that he now suggests I should take.,42
Mr BRUCE , I accept the Chairman's,42
NA,ruling.,42
Mr ANSTEY ,Th e Prime Minister ac-,42
NA,cepts i t when i t suits him.,42
Mr BOWDEN , I rise to a point of,42
NA,order. The House having resolved that,42
NA,"clause 2 be now put, i t must be put and",42
NA,voted 'upon without debate. A motion for,42
NA,dissent cannot be interposed at this stage.,42
NA,Clause agreed to.,42
Mr ANSTEY , I now propose to move,42
NA,that the Chairman's ruling be dissented,42
NA,from.,42
The CHAIRMAN , I cannot accept,42
NA,the motion.,42
Mr ANSTEY ,Yo u are very tyrannical.,42
NA,Under the Standing Orders you must,42
NA,accept a motion for dissent.,42
The CHAIRMAN , The honorable,42
NA,member for Richmond has the floor.,42
Mr FENTON , I rise to a point of order.,42
NA,I t is competent for an honorable member,42
NA,to move dissent from the ruling of the,42
NA,"Chairman at any time, and upon the dis-",42
NA,"sent being submitted i n writing, i t must",42
NA,be decided by the committee. When the,42
NA,"closure had been applied, clause 2 had to",42
NA,"be put to the committee forthwith, and",42
NA,the Acting Leader of the Opposition was,42
NA,not permitted to interpose a motion for,42
NA,dissent. A t the earliest subsequent op-,42
NA,"portunity he seeks to submit'his motion,",42
NA,"and I contend, sir, that you must accept",42
NA,it.,42
The CHAIRMAN , T h e dissent by the,42
NA,honorable member for Bourke relates to,42
NA,"my ruling upon clause 2, which has al-",42
NA,"ready been put and passed; therefore, any",42
NA,motion of dissent relating to that clause,42
NA,is out of order.,42
Mr BRUCE ,Th e right of honorable,42
NA,members to move dissent from a Chair-,42
NA,man's ruling i n certain circumstances is,42
NA,involved i n the point of order raised by,42
NA,the honorable member for Maribyrnong.,42
NA,"You, sir, would not permit the Acting",42
NA,Leader of the Opposition to submit his,42
NA,"dissent u n t i l clause 2 had been put, but",42
NA,"that question having been disposed of, the",42
NA,honorable member is now entitled to move,42
NA,to dissent from your ruling. As an i m -,42
NA,"portant question of procedure is involved,",42
NA,I suggest that we might adopt a course,42
NA,"for which there is precedent, namely, to",42
NA,refer the matter to the Speaker.,42
The CHAIRMAN , I propose to,42
NA,adopt the suggestion of the Prime Minis-,42
NA,"ter, and refer the matter to the Speaker",42
NA,forthwith.,42
Mr ANSTEY ,Th e Standing Orders,42
NA,provide that a motion for dissent must be,42
NA,submitted to the committee.,42
Mr BOWDEN ,Th e Chairman has the,42
NA,right to refer the matter to the Speaker,42
NA,if he eo desires.,42
The CHAIRMAN , A motion to dis-,42

NA,tory that subsequent to the 30th June of,43

NA,w i l l probably remain on the statute-book,43
NA,"for a number of years, no new factories",43
NA,would be able to come under its opera-,43
NA,tion. I have reduced the quantity of,43
NA,"cheese mentioned to26 tons, because",43
NA,cheese factories are generally established,43
NA,in outlying districts before butter fac-,43
NA,tories are erected. A cheese factory can,43
NA,be established at considerably less cost,43
NA,"than a butter factory, and in the majority",43
NA,of cases they are erected unti l there is,43
NA,sufficient production to justify the estab-,43

NA,I have known of farmers who manufac-,43

NA,be excluded under the amendment. No,43
NA,"producer, no matter how small his out-",43
NA,"put, should be excluded from the benefits",43
NA,of the bill. I recollect a small factory,43
NA,near the town of Daylesford which used,43

NA,spectively: Provided that one of,44
NA,the representatives from New South,44

NA,"spectively, -shall be a producer; and",44
NA,(c) two -representatives elected by pro-,44
NA,ducers supplying proprietary but-,44
NA,ter -and cheese factories.,44
NA,Mr E. GREEN - I rise to a point of,44
NA,order. I have given notice of an amend-,44
NA,ment of clause 4 in the terms of the,44
NA,amendment which the honorable member,44
NA,for Capricornia is now submitting. My,44
NA,amendment is in print.,44
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,44
NA,( Sir Neville Howse) -Th e point of,44
NA,order raised by the honorable member,44
NA,cannot be upheld.,44
Mr FORDE , I submitted last Thurs-,44
NA,day the amendments that were circulated,44
NA,in my name. When the amendment that,44
NA,"I have just moved is disposed of, i t",44
NA,will not be necessary for me to move,44
NA,subsequent 'amendments of which I have,44
NA,given notice. ' The amendments by the,44
NA,honorable member for Richmond were,44
NA,"handed to the Clerk after notice of mine,",44
NA,"which cover the whole question, had been",44
NA,given. The bill in its present form provides,44
NA,"that there, shall be one representative of",44
NA,"eachstate, who shall be elected by the",44
NA,boards of directors .of co-operative butter,44
NA,and cheese factories in those states. I,44
NA,am endeavouring to provide that the,44
NA,states .that are .large producers of butter,44
NA,and cheese shall 'each have two represen-,44
NA,tatives and that one in each of those,44
NA,states shall be elected by the producers,44
NA,themselves. Election by the producers,44
NA,will be much more democratic than elec-,44
NA,tion by boards of directors. The election,44
NA,of these representatives can be carried,44
NA,out at the same time that a vote is taken,44
NA,to decide whether this scheme is accep-,44
NA,table to -the primary producers. 'The,44
NA,omission of paragraph d will do away,44
NA,with the representation of Tooley-street,44
NA,on the board. I t is not necessary to have,44
NA,"that representative, ..and I cannot under-",44
NA,stand why such a provision was inserted,44
NA,in the bill. The constitution .of the board,44
NA,proposed by the Government is not accep-,44
NA,"table to Queensland, which produces",44
NA,"60 per cent, of the cheese exported. I f",44
NA,only one .representative is appointed to,44
NA,the board from each of the states -of,44
NA,"Queensland, New South Wales, and Vic-",44
NA,"toria, .that representative will probably",44
NA,be an official. Whilst recognizing the,44
NA,necessity for having the business side of,44
NA,"the industry represented on the board,",44
NA,I want to 'say that i t will be,44
NA,dominated by officials of the co-operative,44
NA,butter and cheese factories. A board,44
NA,comprising two representatives from,44
NA,"Queensland, New South Wales, and Vic-",44
NA,"toria, will be very strong on the business",44
NA,"side, in addition to being thoroughly re-",45
NA,presentative of the primary producers.,45
NA,"The states of South Australia, ""Western",45
NA,"Australia, and Tasmania have each only",45
NA,"one representative upon similar boards,",45
NA,"whilst the otherthree states, which are",45
NA,"tho largest producers, invariably have",45
NA,two representatives each. I n Western,45
NA,Australia comparatively little butter is,45
NA,"produced, and none for export.",45
NA,"smaller states, at interstate confer-",45
NA,"ences, have accepted the principle",45
NA,that preponderating representation must,45
NA,be given to the states that are the,45
NA,largest producers. Western Australia is,45
NA,not yet an exporting state. I contend,45
NA,"that proprietary interests, both manu-",45
NA,"facturing and selling, should be satisfied",45
NA,with two of the twelve representatives on,45
NA,the board. We are endeavouring to help,45
NA,"not' tho proprietary companies, but the",45
NA,"dairy farmers of Australia, and I do not",45
NA,think that the Government need make,45
NA,any apology for giving a preponderating,45
NA,representation to the primary producers.,45
NA,I think that all honorable members can,45
NA,"agree to the amendment, because the",45
NA,finance required to enable the board to,45
NA,carry on its operations will come not out,45
NA,"of the pockets of the taxpayers, but out",45
NA,of the dairying industry itself. I am ex-,45
NA,pressing the wish of all who represent co-,45
NA,"operative control, and honorable members",45
NA,who believe i n co-operation for the dairy,45
NA,farmers should support the views that 1,45
NA,have expressed.,45
Mr R GREEN ,Richmond) [9.44] -,45
NA,1 cannot understand why my point of,45
NA,order was not upheld. The honorable,45
NA,member for Capricornia withdrew the,45
NA,whole of the amendment of which he had,45
NA,"given notice, and in its place moved an-",45
NA,other that had not been printed and cir-,45
NA,culated.,45
Mr FORDE , I merely altered the,45
NA,wording of the amendment which I had,45
NA,circulated.,45
Mr R GREEN ,M y amendment was,45
NA,already in print. I am opposed to the,45
NA,honorable member's amendment.,45
NA,gave notice that I intended to move for,45
NA,the deletion of paragraph 6 of sub-clause,45
NA,"2 of the clause, and the amendment of",45
NA,which the honorable member for Capri-,45
NA,"cornia had given notice, having been",45
NA,"withdrawn, I submit my amendment",45
NA,should now be considered.,45
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,45
NA,The honorable member can move his,45
NA,amendment when the amendment of the,45
NA,honorable member for' Capricornia has,45
NA,been disposed of.,45
Mr R GREEN ,Tha t does not satisfy,45
NA,"me, sir. Clause 4 is one of the most vital",45
NA,in the bill.,45
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,45
NA,The On looking into the amendment proposed,45
NA,"by the honorable member for Capricornia,",45
NA,"I find that i t is not in order, for it pro-",45
NA,"poses to omit the whole clause, and to",45
NA,replace i t by exactly similar words down,45
NA,to the end of paragraph a of sub-clause 2.,45
NA,His amendment being out of order to that,45
NA,"extent, I shall put the clause to the",45
NA,committee in paragraphs.,45
NA,Sub-clause 1 agreed to.,45
NA,Sub-clause 2-,45
NA,The Board shall consist of-,45
NA,(a) one member (in this act referred to,45
NA,"as ""the Government representa-",45
NA,"tive"") who shall be appointed by",45
NA,the Governor-General as the repre-,45
NA,sentative of the Commonwealth Go-,45
NA,vernment;,45
Mr FORDE ,"O n a point of order, I",45
NA,"wish to know whether, after paragraph",45
NA,"a is disposed of, my amendment to para-",45
NA,graph 6 will be submitted.,45
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,45
NA,That is the course.I shall take.,45
NA,Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [9.50].,45
NA,- I object to a board of ten. I t would,45
NA,be too unwieldy and too costly. The,45
NA,Government should reconsider its proposal,45
NA,"in this respect. A board of six, com-",45
NA,posed of a Government representative and,45
NA,"five others, would be large enough. The",45
NA,states which do not produce butter and,45
NA,cheese for export should not be repre-,45
NA,sented on the board.,45
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,45
NA,The only point at present before the,45
NA,committee is whether there shall be a re-,45
NA,presentative of the Government on the,45
NA,"board, and the honorable member is not",45
NA,in order in discussing anything more than,45
NA,that.,45
NA,Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [9.51] -,45
NA,In view of the decision of the committee,45
NA,"I with regard to the taking of polls, I ask",45
NA,the Prime Minister whether he is willing,45
NA,to amend this clause to provide that the,45
NA,producers shall elect the representatives,45
NA,on the board when ' the polls are being,45
NA,"taken, rather than that they shall be ap-",45
NA,pointed by the directors of co-operative,45
NA,companies.,45
NA,The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN -,46
NA,The honorable member is not i n order in,46
NA,asking that question at this stage.,46
NA,"Sub-clause 2, paragraph a, agreed to.",46
NA,"Sub-clause 2, paragraph b-",46
NA,One representative of each state elected by,46
NA,the boards of directors of co-operative butter,46
NA,and cheese factories in that state;,46
NA,Amendment (by Mr FOHDE),46
NA,posed-,46
NA,That paragraph (6) be left out with a view,46
NA,to insert in lieu thereof the following :-,46
NA,(?)) nine representatives elected by the pro-,46
NA,ducers supplying co-operative butter,46
NA,and cheese factories; comprising two,46
NA,"each in New South Wales, Victoria,",46
NA,"and Queensland respectively, and",46
NA,"one each in South Australia, Tas-",46
NA,"mania, and Western Australia re-",46
NA,spectively ;,46
NA,Provided that one of the representatives from,46
NA,"New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland re-",46
NA,spectively shall be a producer; and,46
Mr R GREEN ,"O n a-point of order, I",46
NA,submit that my amendment to paragraph,46
NA,b should have precedence.,46
NA,The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN - I,46
NA,have already ruled that the amendment,46
NA,moved by the honorable member for,46
NA,Capricornia is entitled to precedence.,46
Mr OKEEFE ,Denison) [ 9 . 5 3 ],46
NA,consider that the board should be com-,46
NA,"posed of seven members, namely, one re-",46
NA,presentative of the Commonwealth Go-,46
NA,vernment and one representative from each,46
NA,state. The clause provides for a board of,46
NA,"ten members, and both the honorable",46
NA,member for Capricornia and the honor-,46
NA,able member for Richmond desire that,46
NA,the number shall be increased to thirteen.,46
Mr FORDE , I want twelve members,46
NA,on the board.,46
NA,Mr O ' KEEFE - A board of that size,46
NA,"would be too cumbersome, and would be",46
NA,likely to prove too expensive to the pro-,46
NA,ducers. I would be quite satisfied i f,46
NA,paragraphs c and d of sub-clause 2 were,46
NA,deleted. Since the bill has been framed,46
NA,"ostensibly i n the interests of producers,",46
NA,why should we legislate i n the interests of,46
NA,selling agents? A board of seven would,46
NA,"be more efficient than a board of ten, and",46
NA,certainly more efficient than the unwieldy,46
NA,board suggested by the honorable member,46
NA,for Capricornia.,46
Mr R GREEN ,Richmond) [10.2] -,46
NA,Although I agree w i th the proposal of,46
NA,the honorable member for Capricornia,46
NA,that the board should include nine repre-,46
NA,sentatives of suppliers of co-operative,46
NA,"butter and cheese factories, I cannot",46
NA,accept his proposal that the producers,46
NA,"shall elect the board, nor his proposal",46
NA,that one representative of New South,46
NA,"Wales, Victoria, and Queensland respec-",46
NA,tively shall be a producer. This may,46
NA,"appear strange and undemocratic, but",46
NA,i f the honorable member had attended,46
NA,the recent interstate conference as a dele-,46
NA,pro- gate he would have known that the,46
NA,principle i n the first proposal was,46
NA,rejected for the very good reason,46
NA,that as the boards of directors of co-,46
NA,operative factories are themselves elected,46
NA,"by suppliers, i t is reasonable to assume",46
NA,that they enjoy the confidence of the pro-,46
NA,ducers. I n addition they are more likely,46
NA,to be i n touch with desirable candidates,46
NA,for election to the board as representatives,46
NA,of the producers. The ordinary dairy,46
NA,farmer has not this advantage. I t will,46
NA,"be very difficult, indeed, to keep a roll",46
NA,of the butter producers of Australia up,46
NA,"to date i n readiness f o r an election i f , as",46
NA,"is proposed, members of the board are",46
NA,to be elected every two years. The ex-,46
NA,penses of a Commonwealth-wide election,46
NA,w i ll be out of all proportion to the ad-,46
NA,vantages of such a course. The per-,46
NA,- I sonnel of the board is the .crux of the,46
NA,whole question. I f we insist that one,46
NA,representative of each of the three big,46
NA,butter-producing states on the board shall,46
NA,"be a producer, I am afraid that we shall",46
NA,not achieve the best results.,46
Mr FORDE ,Doe s the honorable mem-,46
NA,ber deny that producers have the ability,46
NA,to sit on the board?,46
Mr R GREEN ," N o , but i t may be",46
NA,very difficult indeed to ensure the elec-,46
NA,tion of the most satisfactory board. I t is,46
NA,"quite possible for a producer to be elected,",46
NA,and for one or both from any of the,46
NA,states to be a producer. The proposal,46
NA,was rejected by the interstate confer-,46
NA,ence for very obvious reasons. There-,46
NA,"fore, I cannot support i t . When i t",46
NA,is disposed of I propose to submit au,46
NA,amendment of which I have given notice.,46
Mr BRUCE ,Flinders-Prim e Minis-,46
NA,ter and Minister f o r External Affairs ),46
NA,[ 1 0 . 9 ] - I cannot accept the amendment.,46
NA,The Government has given a great deal,46
NA,of consideration to this question. The,46
NA,"object, in f r a m i ng this clause, was to",46
NA,get the numbers within the smallest pos-,46
NA,sible compass. We felt that an un-,46
NA,wieldy board would not prove so efficient,46
NA,as a smaller body. B ut since the bill was,46
NA,"drafted, the Government has received re-",47
NA,presentations f r o m producers urging that,47
NA,the number of representatives of co-opera-,47
NA,tive butter and cheese factories be i n -,47
NA,creased. I n support of this claim i t was,47
NA,pointed out that there are three great,47
NA,"exporting states, and three which, at",47
NA,"present, export but very little. The bill",47
NA,provides that each of the,47
NA,shall have equal representation on,47
NA,the board. The Government believes,47
NA,that greater confidence will be given to,47
NA,the producers i f the representation is i,47
NA,creased to embrace an additional mem-,47
NA,ber from each of the states of Queens-,47
NA,"land. New South Wales, and. Victoria, as",47
NA,proposed by the amendment moved by,47
NA,the honorable member for Capricornia.,47
NA,The Government is therefore prepared to,47
NA,"accept that portion of the amendment,",47
NA,but not the proposal that the board shall,47
NA,be elected by the producers. Although,47
NA,this may be a very admirable and demo-,47
NA,"cratic principle, yet i t is faced with grave",47
NA,"difficulties, because the representative men",47
NA,in the industry would possibly be un-,47
NA,known to the producers i n the different,47
NA,districts. The directors of the co-opera-,47
NA,tive companies are elected by the co-,47
NA,"operators in the different districts, and-",47
NA,consequently directly represent the pro-,47
NA,"ducers; therefore the election, although",47
NA,"confined to the directors, would really be",47
NA,controlled by the producers themselves.,47
NA,The directors would be i n a better posi-,47
NA,tion to know the relative merits of the,47
NA,different persons applying for appoint-,47
NA,"ment to the board, and consequently the",47
NA,Government feels that i t is much more,47
NA,"desirable that, the election should be con-",47
NA,fined to them. The Government is pre-,47
NA,pared to accept the amendment i n so far,47
NA,as i t contemplates an increase in the,47
NA,"representation of New South Wales, Vic-",47
NA,"toria, and Queensland, but not the pro-",47
NA,posal for the election to be held by the,47
NA,producers themselves. This will prac-,47
NA,tically conform to the amendment to,47
NA,be moved by the honorable member for,47
NA,Richmond ( Mr R. Green). I suggest,47
NA,that the honorable member for Capri-,47
NA,cornia withdraw paragraph 6 of the,47
NA,amendment and allow the honorable,47
NA,member for Richmond to insert his pro-,47
NA,posal i n its place.,47
Mr FOSTER ,Wakefield) [10.14] - I,47
NA,wish to ask the Prime Minister i f fhe,47
NA,number of representatives proposed in,47
NA,the bill was agreed upon and suggested,47
NA,to the Government by a duly convened,47
NA,conference ?,47
Mr BRUCE ,Flinders-Prim e Minis-,47
NA,ter and Minister for External Affairs),47
NA,[10.15] -Th e number of representatives,47
NA,which appears i n the bill includes one,47
NA,nominee to be appointed by the Govern-,47
NA,"ment, six by the co-operative factories,",47
NA,"states two by the proprietary companies, and",47
NA,one to be a representative of the sellers,47
NA,of dairy produce overseas. That proposal,47
NA,"has not been approved by, nor has i t",47
NA,n - been included i n the bill at the recom-,47
NA,mendation of any conference represent-,47
NA,ing dairying interests. The conference,47
NA,which was held i n Melbourne proposed,47
NA,"the appointment of a board comprising, I",47
NA,"think, fifteen or seventeen members.",47
Mr R GREEN , I t was seventeen alto-,47
NA,gether.,47
Mr BRUCE ,Th e Government felt,47
NA,that that number was too large. The,47
NA,proprietary companies and the Chamber,47
NA,"of Commerce made various suggestions,",47
NA,but none of them is identical with the,47
NA,proposal embodied in the bill. The Go-,47
NA,vernment endeavoured as far as possible,47
NA,to follow generally the suggestions that,47
NA,had been made to reduce the number of,47
NA,representatives on the board so that i t,47
NA,would not be unwieldy and ineffective.,47
NA,The proposal that the Government is now,47
NA,prepared to accept will increase the num-,47
NA,ber by three. The Government felt that,47
NA,even a board of ten members would be,47
NA,"unwieldy, and i n a later clause there is",47
NA,provision for the appointment of an,47
NA,executive. I t is not contemplated that,47
NA,the board of control will be constantly,47
NA,meeting; i t will merely be a body to,47
NA,which the producers will look as the final,47
NA,and determining authority respecting the,47
NA,powers granted under the bill.,47
Mr CUNNINGHAM ,Gwydir) [10.17].,47
NA,- I disagree both with the Government's,47
NA,proposal and with the amendment,47
NA,moved by the honorable member for Cap-,47
NA,"ricomia. This Government, since i t has",47
NA,"been in office, has done nothing but ap-",47
NA,point expensive and unwieldy boards.,47
NA,I t now proposes to establish another.,47
NA,"Even if this proposal were agreed to, i t",47
NA,would be impossible to obtain in the Com-,47
NA,monwealth the requisite number of dairy,47
NA,experts to be appointed to the board.,47
NA,During the first twelve months the opera-,47
NA,tions of the board would largely consist of,47
NA,inquiries respecting possible markets. The,47
NA,"Prime Minister, when introducing the",47
NA,"bill, referred to the New Zealand act, on",48
NA,which he said the bill was in many re-,48
NA,spects modelled. The New Zealand board,48
NA,was established either early this year or,48
NA,"late last year, and in respect of its opera-",48
NA,"tion the following paragraph, headed",48
NA,""" Policy not fixed; delegation to Europe,""",48
NA,"appeared in the New Zealand Dairyman,",48
NA,"dated the 20th February, 1924: -",48
NA,The most important matter discussed at the,48
NA,"meeting of this board was the future policy,",48
NA,and after mature consideration it was unani-,48
NA,mously decided that before any definite policy,48
NA,could be adopted very fall and complete inves-,48
NA,"tigation of the markets of Canada, United",48
NA,"States of America, and Europe should be made",48
NA,by a delegation consisting of three members,48
NA,of the board. The personnel of the delegation,48
NA,"would be decided at the next meeting, and the",48
NA,"itinerary would be fixed, and a schedule be",48
NA,pared of matters requiring particular investi-,48
NA,gation. The delegation obviously could not get,48
NA,through the work and return to New Zealand,48
NA,"before October, and it was therefore doubtful",48
NA,whether any form of control would be exer-,48
NA,cised over butter and its export during the,48
NA,next season.,48
NA,That is the experience of New Zealand.,48
NA,"A board of control was appointed, and it",48
NA,"held a meeting in February, 1924.",48
NA,there will be no control over the coming,48
NA,"season's production, because the board has",48
NA,not investigated possible markets. I t is,48
NA,ridiculous to suggest that twelve members,48
NA,"should be appointed to a board of control,",48
NA,which during the next twelve months can,48
NA,do nothing else than investigate overseas,48
NA,markets. I t would be much preferable to,48
NA,have a small competent board.,48
NA,NA,48
NA,the appointment of a small executive.,48
Mr CUNNINGHAM , T h e n appoint,48
NA,"the executive, and not the board. Suc-",48
NA,"cessful businesses are conducted, not",48
NA,"by a large number . of managers,",48
NA,but. by a few capable men.,48
NA,i t may be possible to secure the ser-,48
NA,vices of three or of five first-rate men,48
NA,"to control the industry, i f a large number",48
NA,of members are appointed to the board,48
NA,there will be some amongst them who are,48
NA,"not experts, or even first class men i n the",48
NA,business. I was surprised to hear the,48
NA,Prime Minister state that he is not pre-,48
NA,pared to allow the producers to elect the,48
NA,members of the board. He is prepared,48
NA,to send this bill to them for acceptance or,48
NA,"rejection, but be is not prepared to permit",48
NA,"them to elect the board, whose duty i t",48
NA,will be to administer the measure. I t is,48
NA,"strange that members of this Parliament,",48
NA,"who are elected by the people, should re-",48
NA,"fuse to trust the dairy farmers, with the",48
NA,election of the members of this board,48
NA,which w i l l haveautocratic powers i n the,48
NA,disposition of their produce. The board,48
NA,"will be able to mortgage i t , to insure i t ,",48
NA,"or not, as i t thinks fit, and to sell i t where,",48
NA,"when, or for what price i t pleases. I t is",48
NA,opposed to all the principles of democracy,48
NA,to refuse to permit the men who are pro-,48
NA,ducing butter to say who shall be mem-,48
NA,bers of the board appointed to control its,48
NA,export. I cannot approve of the amend-,48
NA,ments of the honorable members for Capri-,48
NA,"cornia and Richmond, or of the proposal",48
NA,of the Government. They pander to the,48
NA,fetish of state rights. W h y should Queens-,48
NA,land have separate representation from,48
NA,New South Wales on the board ? What is,48
NA,prethe difference between the butter producer,48
NA,in Queensland and the man producing,48
NA,"butter i n New South Wales, Victoria, or",48
NA,South Australia? The proposals made,48
NA,would keep alive state jealousies.,48
NA,Mr M . CAMERON -No t at all .,48
Mr CUNNINGHAM , W o u l d not the,48
NA,"honorable member, i f a member ""of the",48
NA,"board, deal as conscientiouslv with butter",48
NA,Yet produced i n Queensland as with butter,48
NA,"produced i n South Australia, the state",48
NA,from which he comes?,48
NA,Mr M . CAMERON - A much greater,48
NA,quantity is produced i n some states than,48
NA,in others.,48
Mr CUNNINGHAM , B u t the whole,48
NA,production intended for export w i l l be,48
NA,"under the control of the board, and w i l l",48
NA,"be dealt with, not as Queensland butter,",48
NA,"or as New South Wales butter, but as",48
NA,Australian butter. I f the principle of,48
NA,state rights is introduced i n the constitu-,48
NA,"tion of the board, i t will prevent i t taking",48
NA,"a broad view of its duty, because state",48
NA,jealousies will be allowed to creep i n . We,48
NA,Whilst have seen this i n connexion with a mea-,48
NA,sure before the chamber which has still to,48
NA,"be dealt with, and i n connexion with",48
NA,which i t has been stated that i t involves,48
NA,an assault upon the rights of Victoria. I,48
NA,hope that this bill will not be overloaded,48
NA,by the appointment of an unwieldy board.,48
NA,The Commonwealth Bank w s carried a,48
NA,on for years under the control of one,48
NA,man. I t was never suggested that there,48
NA,should be state representation on the,48
NA,board of control of that bank. There is,48
NA,not state representation on the Shipping,48
NA,"Board, or on other boards that could be",48
NA,mentioned. I am opposed to the amend-,48
NA,ments of the honorable members f o r,48
NA,"Capricornia and Richmond, and when",48
NA,they are disposed of i t is my intention to,48
NA,move tlie omission of paragraph b of sub-,49
NA,clause 2 with a view to insert i n its,49
NA,place-,49
NA,(b) Three representatives elected by the prothe,49
NA,ducers of butter and cheese in the Common-,49
NA,wealth.,49
NA,Under my amendment we should trust,49
NA,the people most concerned to elect the,49
NA,"right men to the board. ""With the repre-",49
NA,sentative of the Commonwealth Govern-,49
NA,"ment provided f o r i n paragraph a, and",49
NA,the repesentative provided for i n para-,49
NA,"graph d, my amendment would make pro-",49
NA,vision f o r a board of five. We should be,49
NA,able to secure a hoard of five efficient,49
NA,administrators. The board proposed by,49
NA,"the bill, and by the amendments which",49
NA,"have been suggested, would prove un-",49
NA,"wieldy and expensive,""and the burden of",49
NA,its cost would be placed on the backs of,49
NA,the suppliers of milk and cream to the,49
NA,butter and cheese factories.,49
Mr LATHAM ,Kooyong) [10.28] -,49
NA,The object of the bill is to constitute,49
NA,board which will deal with such matters as representatives,49
NA,"financing and marketing, and will not",49
NA,with the production of dairy produce at ducers,49
NA,all. I t is for. this reason thab under,49
NA,"clause 4, paragraphs 6 and c, i t",49
NA,posed that the members of the board shall,49
NA,be elected by the directors of two classes left without representation.,49
NA,of factories. B u t there is nothing,49
NA,ever to prevent those directors electing butter factory.,49
NA,producers to positions on the board i f,49
NA,think fit. The directors are concerned,49
NA,with getting the best price for the proa,49
NA,"ducts, and prima facie they are much",49
NA,more skilled i n matters of marketing and,49
NA,finance than are the producers themsupply,49
NA,"selves. Many of them are producers, and",49
NA,are chosen by the dairy farmers to look,49
NA,after the commercial side of the butter,49
NA,"business. I t appears to me, therefore,",49
NA,that they are the proper persons to make,49
NA,the selection. For that reason I am unI,49
NA,able to support the amendment.,49
Mr GABB ,Angas) [10.31] -Som e,49
NA,of the gentlemen mentioned by the honorhe says-,49
NA,able member for Kooyong ( Mr Latham),49
NA,as being the commercial leaders of the co-,49
NA,"operative societies, have themselves exbeing",49
NA,pressed the desire to have producers on,49
NA,the board. They have pointed out that dairymen,49
NA,very important decisions may have to be any,49
NA,"made, and that i n many instances they",49
NA,themselves are only the servants of the,49
NA,"societies, and not members. They believe",49
NA,tha.t i t would considerably strengthen members,49
NA,their hands i f on such occasions they had,49
NA,with them one of the actual producers. cheese companies.,49
NA,[184],49
NA,I was surprised to hear the Prime Minis-,49
NA,"ter ( Mr Bruce) say that, pos-",49
NA,"sibly, the producers would not know",49
NA,men for whom they were,49
NA,asked to vote. Yet the right hon-,49
NA,orable gentleman proposes to ask them to,49
NA,vote on this bill. I f he is satisfied that,49
NA,the dairy producers are capable of giving,49
NA,"an intelligent vote regarding the bill, I",49
NA,am equally satisfied that they will know,49
NA,the best men i n their own state connected,49
NA,"with the butter industry, and will be able",49
NA,to elect proper representatives to the,49
NA,board. The dairymen desire to have a,49
NA,voice i n the election ef the board. The,49
NA,position i n South Australia is different,49
NA,"from that of any other state, i n that 70",49
NA,"per cent, of the butter is manufactured",49
NA,"by proprietary companies, and not. by co-",49
NA,operative companies. Under this bill the,49
NA,"suppliers of 70 per cent, of South Aus-",49
NA,"tralian butter will have to take "" p o t -",49
NA,"luck."" I t is quite possible that ""Victoria,-",49
NA,with double the number of proprietary,49
NA,"a factories, will be able to elect both the",49
NA,of the proprietary,49
NA,"deal factories, so that unless the pro-",49
NA,themselves have the right,49
NA,"to elect representatives on the board,",49
NA,is prothe suppliers of butter and cream,49
NA,to the South Australian factories will be,49
NA,I n South,49
NA,whatAustralia there is also a Government,49
NA,"Under these proposals,",49
NA,they where do the dairymen who supply that,49
NA,factory come in? W i l l i t be considered,49
NA,proprietary company or a co-operative,49
NA,"company? I t seems to me that, unless",49
NA,"the producers are given a vote, those who",49
NA,the Government factory in South,49
NA,Australia will be left without representa-,49
NA,tion on the board. I have a letter here,49
NA,"from a gentleman who, unti l recently,",49
NA,was the president of the Dairymen's,49
NA,"Association of South Australia, although.",49
NA,believe that at the last election for pre-,49
NA,sident he was defeated by a Labour mem-,49
NA,ber of Parliament. I n this letter he speaks,49
NA,for the dairymen of South Australia when,49
NA,"We ask that, as i t is our produce that is",49
NA,"dealt with, the dairymen should elect",49
NA,the two members of the board by ballot - The,49
NA,of South Australia have no faith i n,49
NA,proprietary factory owner. As a matter of,49
NA,"fact, the Government had to build a factory",49
NA,so that the state could protect the dairymen,49
NA,from the merchant. The suppliers of this fac-,49
NA,tory wil l be absolutely unrepresented i f the,49
NA,of the board are to be selected as pro-,49
NA,posed. I n all the other states' the dairymen,49
NA,are only organized in co-operative butter and,49
NA,I t - is different in South,49
NA,"Australia, where for two years we have had a",50
NA,"Dairymen's Association with about 1,000 mem-",50
NA,".bers already enrolled, and we will have all the",50
NA,dairymen in before the two years are up for,50
NA,the proposed board of control.,50
NA,"On behalf of the 1,000 men organized i n",50
NA,"the dairying industry i n South Australia,",50
NA,many of whom under this bil l will be ab-,50
NA,"solutely without representation, I appeal",50
NA,to the committee to allow the producers,50
NA,to have a say as to who shall constitute,50
NA,the board. I f I can obtain the support,50
NA,"of one member i n a call for a division,",50
NA,there will be at least two to say that the,50
NA,producers shall elect the members of the,50
NA,board of control.,50
Mr MANNING ,Macquarie) [10.37].,50
NA,- I am sorry that the,50
NA,Minister ( Mr Bruce) has,50
NA,'fit to alter his original intention as,50
NA,"set out i n this bill. The board, as pro-",50
NA,"posed to be constituted under the bill ,",50
NA,was more likely to be satisfactory than,50
NA,the larger and more cumbersome cne,50
NA,which i t is now proposed to elect under,50
NA,the amendment to which the right honor-,50
NA,able gentleman has agreed. I t might,50
NA,appear to be unfair to give the same re-,50
NA,presentation to the states which produce,50
NA,small quantities of butter as is proposed,50
NA,"to be given to Queensland, New South",50
NA,"Wales, and Victoria, but there is a pos-",50
NA,sibility that the production of butter in,50
NA,those states will before long be increased,50
NA,considerably. There is a good deal i n,50
NA,the contention of the honorable mem-,50
NA,bers for Gwydir ( Mr Cunningham) and,50
NA,"Denison ( Mr O'Keefe), that a board can",50
NA,be too cumbersome. I f we were to have,50
NA,"a board of ten, as originally suggested,",50
NA,there would be six representatives of the,50
NA,"co-operative factories, who would have an",50
NA,absolute majority ; but at the same time,50
NA,the other interests would be represented.,50
NA,Success depends entirely on the personnel,50
NA,-of the board. Unless we get a board re-,50
NA,presentative of all branches of the indus-.,50
NA,"try, i t will not be a success. We had a",50
NA,very good representative pool control com-,50
NA,"mittee, which did valuable work during",50
NA,the war period. The honorable member,50
NA,for Fremantle ( Mr Watson) was one of,50
NA,them. Some of the most valuable men,50
NA,on that committee were men connected,50
NA,with the trade. I t is all very well to,50
NA,speak of the producers having represen-,50
NA,"tation. I am a producer, and know",50
NA,something about this matter.,50
NA,South Wales we had to elect a represen-,50
NA,tative onthe Wheat Pool.,50
NA,say unhesitatingly that the man whom,50
NA,we selected would never have been,50
NA,chosen i f we had had a chance to,50
NA,know something about h i m personally.,50
NA,The rank and file have no knowledge of,50
NA,these men. We are more likely to secure,50
NA,the services of men who w i l l work genu-,50
NA,inely for the success of the scheme i f they,50
NA,are elected by the directors of the co-,50
NA,"operative companies, who' are i n turn",50
NA,"elected by their own suppliers, .than i f we",50
NA,adopt the cumbersome and expensive pro-,50
NA,cess of leaving the choice to a vote of the,50
NA,suppliers themselves. The suppliers might,50
NA,elact men who know the dairying industry,50
NA,"perfectly well, but there would be no",50
NA,guarantee that the men so chosen would,50
NA,know anything about overseas marketing.,50
NA,One of the causes of the early failure of,50
NA,Prime the co-operative movement was the selec-,50
NA,seen tion of directors who did not understand,50
NA,the business they h'ad to carry on. Honor-,50
NA,able members on both sides must recog-,50
NA,"nize that to make a success of this bill, i t",50
NA,is essential that its administration shall be,50
NA,placed i n the hands of business men. I f,50
NA,good business men can be secured among,50
NA,"the producers themselves, they will stand",50
NA,just as much chance of being elected by,50
NA,the directors of the co-operative factories,50
NA,as they would i f the matter were l e ft to,50
NA,a vote of the rank and file. The honorable,50
NA,member for Angas ( Mr Gabb) spoke of,50
NA,the proprietary companies i n South Aus-,50
NA,"tralia, but their number is negligible.",50
Mr GABB ,W e have i n South Aus-,50
NA,tralia three times as many proprietary,50
NA,companies as there are i n New South,50
NA,Wales.,50
Mr MANNING , T h e r e are hardly,50
NA,any proprietary dairy factories i n New,50
NA,"South Wales, and there are none in",50
NA,Queensland.,50
Mr GABB ,Ther e are three i n Queens-,50
NA,land.,50
Mr MANNING , I f there are three,50
NA,"in Queensland, the number is sosmall that",50
NA,their votes wil l not count. The over-,50
NA,whelming voting strength of the pro-,50
NA,prietary dairy companies wil l be in Vic-,50
NA,"toria, and, therefore, the Victorian pro-",50
NA,prietary factories will elect the two re-,50
NA,presentatives of the proprietary companies,50
NA,on the board.,50
Mr GABB ,W e shall ask for the hon-,50
NA,orable member's support for an amend-,50
NA,ment to obviate that.,50
Mr MANNING , I f the Prime Minis-,50
NA,"ter had given way, there would have been",50
NA,I n New a board of thirteen. I quite endorse the,50
NA,words of the honorable member for Rich-,50
NA,"I mond, that i f we are to get a good board",50
NA,i t must be directly elected by the direc-,50
NA,tors of the co-operative companies.,50
Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [10.44] - I,51
NA,am sorry that the Prime Minister could,51
NA,not accept my amendment. I t differs from,51
NA,the amendment proposed by the honorable,51
NA,member for Richmond by providing that,51
NA,the nine representatives of the producers,51
NA,shall be elected by the producers instead,51
NA,of bv the directors of the co-operative,51
NA,"butter and cheese factories, as proposed by",51
NA,"him, and that one of the representatives",51
NA,from the three eastern states respectively,51
NA,shall be a producer. Although I am sorry,51
NA,that the Prime Minister is not prepared,51
NA,to allow the suppliers to elect their,51
NA,"representatives on the board, I am pleased",51
NA,that he has accepted the suggestion for,51
NA,increasing tbe number of representatives,51
NA,of the producers as proposed i n my amend-,51
NA,"ment, and also that of the honorable mem-",51
NA,ber for Richmond. I n a democratic coun-,51
NA,"try, no one would contend that such a",51
NA,vital question as who should represent,51
NA,"them on an important board, should not",51
NA,be submitted to a vote of the people con-,51
NA,"cerned. I n Queensland, all the men who",51
NA,have taken a prominent part i n the estab-,51
NA,lishment of co-operative butter and cheese,51
NA,"factories, and their subseauent control, are",51
NA,well known. Among a small coterie of,51
NA,directors of co-operative factories i t is easy,51
NA,for a certain amount of log rolling to,51
NA,"be done, with the result",51
NA,the best men. may not be elected.,51
NA,"On the other hand, the producers know",51
NA,the men who possess business acumen,51
NA,"and the best experience, and I am",51
NA,sure the best decision would be arrived,51
NA,at by trusting the people who sup-,51
NA,ply the cream to make the choice. I re-,51
NA,gret that the Prime Minister could not,51
NA,agree to this fundamental principle. I,51
NA,do not agree with the contention that the,51
NA,proposed board w i ll be too cumbersome.,51
NA,I t will only mean twelve for the whole,51
NA,of Australia. By the same line of reason-,51
NA,ing honorable members might contend that,51
NA,the number of members of the House of,51
NA,Representatives could be cut down by one-,51
NA,half. The board proposed to be created,51
NA,will have many difficulties confronting i t .,51
NA,I t will be necessary to have the best,51
NA,brains representative of the dairy farmers,51
NA,"in Australia to overcome those difficulties,",51
NA,and I am sure that twelve men sitting,51
NA,at a table and talking a matter over w i l l,51
NA,come to a better decision than three men,51
NA,possibly could. The proposal to have a,51
NA,board of twelve is no departure from the,51
NA,"New Zealand act, which provides for two",51
NA,"Government representatives, nine repre-",51
NA,sentatives of the primary producers ap-,51
NA,pointed -by the Governor-General after,51
NA,"election i n the manner provided, and one",51
NA,"member representing Tooley-street, in",51
NA,London. The method of election provided,51
NA,in the act is as follows: -,51
NA,"Of the producers' representatives, six shall",51
NA,be elected in the prescribed manner by direct,51
NA,vote of the producers carrying on business in,51
NA,"the North Island, and three shall be similarly",51
NA,elected by producers carrying on business in,51
NA,the South Island.,51
NA,I t will be noted that North Island has,51
NA,"six representatives, because of its greater",51
NA,"importance, and South Island only three",51
NA,representatives. We ask that the dairy,51
NA,farmers of Australia supplying co-,51
NA,operative factories shall be given the,51
NA,"same representation as in New Zealand,",51
NA,"namely, nine members on the board. 1""",51
NA,am pleased that the Prime Minister has,51
NA,agreed to this. Some honorable members,51
NA,have raised objection to the proposal that,51
NA,the three eastern states should have two,51
NA,"representatives each, but when the matter",51
NA,is considered on the basis of the quantity,51
NA,"of butter produced, there can be no objec-",51
NA,tion to the proposal. The total produc-,51
NA,tion of butter i n the eastern states,51
NA,"is as follows:-Ne w South Wales,",51
NA,"67,838 tons; Victoria, 74,704 tons;",51
NA,"Queensland, 51,199 tons; a total of",51
NA,"that 193,741 tons. , Then we find that",51
NA,"Tasmania produces 5,905 tons; Western",51
NA,"Australia 2,422 tons; and South Australia,",51
NA,"13,042 tons; or a total of 21,369 tons for",51
NA,the three smaller states. The three,51
NA,eastern states of the mainland produced,51
NA,ten times as much butter as is produced,51
NA,"by the other three, therefore, the two to",51
NA,one representation given to them is not,51
NA,too much. The three large butter - pro-,51
NA,ducing states have 236 co-operative fac-,51
NA,"tories, and 84 proprietary factories. The",51
NA,"other three states, Tasmania, South Aus-",51
NA,tralia and Western Australia have 34 co-,51
NA,"operative factories, and 39 proprietary",51
NA,factories. I think Queensland has only,51
NA,three proprietary factories. I appeal to,51
NA,honorable members not to be too nig-,51
NA,gardly i n the granting of representation.,51
NA,"The representatives of the dairy farmers,",51
NA,"who believe i n co-operative control, have",51
NA,asked f o r a board constituted as I have,51
NA,"proposed i n my amendment, and I hope",51
NA,that i f honorable members cannot achieve,51
NA,their desire to have the board elected by,51
NA,"the producers, they w i l l accept the nine",51
NA,representatives proposed by the honorable,51
NA,member f o r Richmond.,51
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [10.53].,52
NA,- - I understand that the proposed board,52
NA,will have power to compel factories to,52
NA,export a proportion of their butter.,52
Mr GABB ,Th e board will not be able,52
NA,to do that.,52
Mr FENTON , I believe that that is,52
NA,"the desire, and I should like the Prime",52
NA,Minister to say definitely whether the,52
NA,board will have the power under this bill,52
NA,to compel factories to export a portion,52
NA,of their butter whether or not they so,52
NA,desire.,52
Mr BRUCE ,Th e board will not have,52
NA,any such power.,52
Mr FENTON ,Wil l the factories,52
NA,who sell their butter direct to buyers in,52
NA,Australia have the right to continue to,52
NA,do so ?,52
Mr BRUCE ,Absolutely .,52
NA,Mr M. CAMERON (Boothby) [10.58].,52
NA,The clause provides that one representa-,52
NA,"tive shall be given to South Australia,",52
NA,and presumably he will be elected by the,52
NA,co-operative factories. I n that state,52
NA,practically all the cheese factories are,52
NA,"operative, and the butter factories are",52
NA,"proprietary, and either one or the other",52
NA,will be without representation. I shall,52
NA,be obliged to move that one. of the rep-,52
NA,resentatives of the proprietary interests,52
NA,"shall be from South Australia, or that",52
NA,both those representatives shall not be,52
NA,elected from one state. The members of,52
NA,the board should be elected by all sup-,52
NA,"pliers, otherwise the large number of pro-",52
NA,ducers who supply the Government fac-,52
NA,tory in South Australia will have no rep-,52
NA,"resentation. Therefore, I shall move",52
NA,later that the South Australian repre-,52
NA,sentative shall be elected by both pro-,52
NA,prietary and co-operative factories;,52
NA,"alternatively, that that state shall have",52
NA,direct representation of the proprietary,52
NA,interests. I am not in favour of un-,52
NA,"wieldy boards, but, considering the magni- MCGrath, D. C.",52
NA,"tude of the industry, I fail to see how",52
NA,adequate representation could be secured,52
NA,by a board smaller than that provided for,52
NA,under the amendment.,52
NA,Mr J. FRANCIS -Doe s the Government,52
NA,proj)ose to accept the amendment in,52
NA,favour of two representatives from each,52
NA,"- of the states of Queensland, New South",52
NA,"Wales, and Victoria?",52
Mr BRUCE ,Ves .,52
Mr MACKAY ,"Lilley) [11.2] -Ther e Gibson, W. G.",52
NA,"is a danger of having too unwieldy a Green, R.",52
NA,"board, and considering the salaries to be",52
NA,"paid, a large expenditure will be in-",52
NA,volved. I agree to each of the large pro-,52
NA,"ducing states-Queensland , New South",52
NA,"Wales, and Victoria-havin g two repre-",52
NA,"sentatives, but I do not think that South",52
NA,"Australia, Western Australia, and Tas-",52
NA,mania would be greatly inconvenienced i f,52
NA,they had no direct representation.,52
Mr GREGORY ,The n Western Austra-,52
NA,lia would not come under the operation,52
NA,of the bill.,52
Mr MACKAY ,Wester n Australia,52

Mr ANSTEY ,Bourke) [11.19] - I,53
NA,have listened w i th interest to the remark*,53
NA,of the honorable member f o r Richmondj,53
NA,and I f a i l to understand the amendment,53
NA,"that he has moved. H i s arguments, how-",53
NA,"ever, were apparently so effective that",53
NA,they induced the Prime Minister to,53
NA,accept the amendment without giving to,53
NA,this committee his reasons f o r doing so.,53
NA,M t . BRUCE - I gave the reasons earlier,53
NA,in the debate.,53
Mr ANSTEY , T h e n they must have,53
NA,been obscured by the arguments that,53
NA,were subsequently raised by the honor-,53
NA,able member f o r Richmond. Having,53
NA,"convinced the Prime Minister, "" under the",53
NA,"lap "" of the House, that the amendment",53
NA,"should be accepted, the honorable mem-",53
NA,ber f o r Richmond was not satisfied w i t h,53
NA,his victory. He had to make a long,53
NA,speech to expedite the passage of the,53
NA,amendment. I feel that I shall be acting,53
NA,"i n the interests of the honorable member,",53
NA,"of the Byron Bay district i n particular,",53
NA,"and of the country generally, i f I empha-",53
NA,size the importance of the amendment. I,53
NA,understand that its purpose is to enable,53
NA,certain producers to be given two repre-,53
NA,sentatives. I f any deduction can be drawn,53
NA,fro m the speech just made by the honor-,53
NA,"able member for Richmond, i t is that he-",53
NA,is not prepared to give the producers of,53
NA,Australia any representation on the board.,53
NA,"H e is not taking a broad, national view of",53
NA,"the matter, but is still limited to the nar-",53
NA,"row, parochial state outlook. There are",53
NA,"154,000 dairy producers i n Australia, of",53
NA,"whom 87 per cent, are i n Victoria, New",53
NA,"South Wales, and Queensland, the figures",53
NA,"for those three states being, 42,000,",53
NA,"56,000, and 35,000 respectively. I n the",53
NA,great speech which the Prime Minister,53
NA,made yesterday at the Nationalist confer-,53
NA,ence he stressed the necessity for demo-,53
NA,cratizing the Nationalist party. Accord-,53
NA,"ing to him, the Nationalist party was dy-",53
NA,"ing, and the only thing that could save.",53
NA,its life wasdemocratization. He is pro-,54
NA,ceeding to democratize it by accepting an,54
NA,amendment to this clause which will deny,54
NA,the dairy producers any representation on,54
NA,the board. The men who work the dairy,54
NA,farms and are the backbone of the indus-,54
NA,"try, are to have no voice in the disposal",54
NA,of their products.,54
NA,Mr R. GBEEN -Wha t i circus !,54
Mr ANSTEY ,Th e honorable mem-,54
NA,ber is a good judge of circuses. I t is,54
NA,nothing but his verbosity that has brought,54
NA,"me to my feet, and I can assure him that",54
NA,I shall be just as exuberant in the early,54
NA,hours of the morning as I am now. I,54
NA,submit that the representation 'on the,54
NA,board will be on an altogether inequitable,54
NA,basis i f the amendment is agreed to.,54
NA,"Western Australia, South Australia, and",54
NA,"Tasmania export very little dairy produce,",54
NA,and yet they are to be given substantial,54
NA,representation on the board. Ninety per,54
NA,"cent, of the dairy produce exported from",54
NA,"Australia goes from Victoria, New South",54
NA,"Wales, and Queensland. I cannot under-",54
NA,stand how the Prime Minister can har-,54
NA,monize his recently expressed views on fhe,54
NA,democratizing of the Nationalist party,54
NA,with the proposed representation en the,54
NA,dairy export control board. Neither he,54
NA,nor the honorable member for Richmond,54
NA,is taking a broad national view of the,54
NA,"subject. The Prime Minister, like myself,",54
NA,wishes to save this country from the ex-,54
NA,tremes of reactionary conservatism and,54
NA,of reactionary communism. I intend to,54
NA,"read, for honorable members' information,",54
NA,"extracts from what may be regarded as a,",54
NA,confidential communication addressed to,54
NA,the right honorable gentleman by the,54
NA,"Kerang Co-operative Butter Factory,",54
NA,"which is hostile to the measure, as, in-",54
NA,"deed, the Prime Minister is. He does not",54
NA,"believe in i t in a broad national sense,",54
NA,only because he has to comply with the,54
NA,wishes of the blackmailers. We all appre-,54
NA,ciate the position in which the Prime,54
NA,Minister finds himself. Do we not see,54
NA,"the honorable members for Richmond,",54
NA,"Cowper, and New England holding him",54
NA,up and demanding blackmail? The Prime,54
NA,Minister is inundated with communica-,54
NA,tions from an i*arfs of the country object-,54
NA,"ing to the bill. Of course, he does not",54
NA,"take us into his confidence, and, there-",54
NA,"fore, I wish to place on record this in-",54
NA,teresting statement from the Kerang Co-,54
NA,operative Butter Factory-,54
NA,We wired to you this afternoon as follows,54
NA,"- "" We respectfully and emphatically protest",54
NA,against giving control of our business to any,54
NA,board. We desire freedom to sell our surplus,54
NA,"at f.o.b. prices.""",54
NA,How scandalous i t is that healthy com-,54
NA,petition should be eliminated by an act,54
NA,of this Government! We could under-,54
NA,stand the wild hare-brained and long-,54
NA,"haired revolutionary "" scoundrels "" on this",54
NA,side of the committee desiring to elimi-,54
NA,"nate public competition, but surely never",54
NA,"this Government! Nevertheless, that is-",54
NA,what the Government is doing in this bill.,54
NA,"Ministers are driven, not by their prin-",54
NA,"ciples, but by the necessities of the hour,",54
NA,because they have to look for their support,54
NA,"not to honorable members behind them,",54
NA,"but to honorable 'members in the corner,",54
NA,who take advantage of the fact that they,54
NA,"hold the balance of power, and, in the",54
NA,"language of the Prime Minister, levy this-",54
NA,specious blackmail upon the Government.,54
NA,I object to the proposal of the honorable-,54
NA,"member for Richmond, and to the accept-",54
NA,ance of i t by the Prime Minister. This,54
NA,great industry should not be controlled by,54
NA,a board representative of the areas within,54
NA,state boundaries; its economic interests-,54
NA,should be studied. The Prime Min-,54
NA,ister has denounced the Russian-,54
NA,sovietism. What is its aim? . Its pur-,54
NA,"pose, first of all, is to ensure economic, in-",54
NA,"stead of political, control of industry.",54
NA,That is the basis of the Russian revolu-,54
NA,tion. I t swept away the rule of great,54
NA,"industries by politicians, and substituted",54
NA,for it rule by experts. This bill makes a,54
NA,"concession to that principle, but the",54
NA,amendment of the honorable member for,54
NA,Richmond will have the effect of taking,54
NA,the control of the industry away from the,54
NA,real producers of the commodity and plac-,54
NA,ing i t in the hands of the actual exporters-.,54
Mr MANNING , I call attention to the,54
NA,but state of the committee. [Quorum formed.],54
Mr ANSTEY ,Th e different in-,54
NA,terests should be represented on the board,54
NA,of control. There is a wide diversity of,54
NA,opinion respecting its constitution. At,54
NA,"Tallangatta, in the district of the honor-",54
NA,"able member for Indi. ( Mr Cook), who-",54
NA,"is an expert in pig culture, a butter fac-",54
NA,tory has been established - That factory,54
NA,sends half of its output to persons who,54
NA,consign it direct to London. The other,54
NA,half is sold to firms under the f.o.b.,54
NA,arrangement. Last year the factory made,54
NA,£900 more out of the f.o.b. arrangement,54
NA,: than it did out of the process of consign-,54
NA,"ing. As a result, large numbers of dairy",54
NA,farmers prefer to accept the f.o.b. price,55
NA,without speculating on the London mar-,55
NA,ket. Under the b i l l the f.o.b. arrange-,55
NA,ment w i l l be absolutely destroyed.,55
NA,NA,55
Mr ANSTEY , I challenge the hon-,55
NA,orable member to prove his statement.,55
NA,"As a matter of fact, i n New Zealand,",55
NA,"under the board of control, the f.o.b. sys-",55
NA,tem was destroyed. The f.o.b. buyers,55
NA,"there, because of the uncertainty of",55
NA,"supplies, dared not enter",55
NA,contract with oversea buyers f or,55
NA,"the delivery of 1,000 cwt. of",55
NA,butter. The honorable member f o r,55
NA,F r a n k l in ( Mr Seabrook) knows very,55
NA,"well that the Navigation Committee, dur-",55
NA,"ing its investigations, was informed that",55
NA,contracts could not be entered into un-,55
NA,less supplies were assured. Under this,55
NA,bill the board w i l l have power to refuse,55

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,.,55

Mr CUNNINGHAM ,Gwydir) [11.49].,55
NA,- I foreshadowed an amendment when I,55
NA,spoke previously on this subject. I then,55
NA,gave sufficient and adequate reasons why,55
NA,it should be inserted i n the bill. This,55

Mr FORDE ,The y would have a vote,56

NA,"moved earlier, which was not accepted.",56
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong ) [12.45,56
NA,NOES. a.m.] - I do not know that the honorable,56
NA,member has much chance of inducing the,56
NA,"committee to accept the amendment, i n",56
NA,view of the vote that was recorded on the,56
NA,amendment that he previously moved.,56
NA,By clause 5 i t is provided that the elec-,56

NA,held on the same day as that appointed,56
NA,for the taking of a poll to ascertain,56
NA,whether the dairymen are favorable to,56
NA,this scheme. That disposes of the bogy,56
NA,raised by various members of the com-,56
NA,mittee that delay would be caused i f the,56
NA,producers were asked to elect representa-,56
NA,tives to the board. I shall support the,56
NA,amendment i n order that the producers,56
NA,may have a say i n the management of,56
NA,the scheme. The Prime Minister ( Mr .,56
NA,Bruce) stressed the point that the mea-,56
NA,sure was framed on democratic lines.,56
NA,Why can he not allow the producers to,56
NA,elect representatives to the board?,56
Mr GABB ,Angas) [12.49 a.m.] - I,56
NA,support the amendment. Again I point,56
NA,out to the Prime Minister the position,56
NA,"that exists i n South Australia, where 70'",56
NA,"per cent, of the suppliers supply to pro-",56
NA,prietary companies. The right honor-,56
NA,able gentleman is prepared to allow the,56
NA,directorate of 33 factories to elect repre-,56
NA,"to this board, while the",56
NA,"propriesuppliers can "" go hang."" We shall",56
NA,"push this matter to a vote, to",56
NA,right show that the Government is not,56
NA,prepared to give the producers the right,56
NA,say who shall control an in-,56
NA,dustry that means so much to them.,56
NA,The honorable member f o r Maribyrnong,56
NA,( Mr Fenton) has expressed surprise that,56
NA,the the Government w i l l not accept this,56
NA,"amendment, but I am not at all surprised.",56
NA,I n nearly The Government has always stood f o r the,56
NA,"interests of the big men, and I have no",56
NA,doubt that i t w i l l continue to do so. I f,56

Mr ANSTEY ,"Bourke) F12.51 a,m.] -",57
NA,Why is the honorable mernber for Angas,57
NA,so pessimistic? Surely he knows that,57
NA,the righteous cause must ultimately,57
NA,triumph. I shall support the amend-,57
NA,"ment, for i t isdemocratic. The Govern-",57
NA,ment surely realizes that substantial pro-,57
NA,gress in this country must be based upon,57
NA,democratic principles. The dairying in-,57
NA,dustry is of great importance to Austra-,57
NA,"lia, and' for that .reason i f for no other",57
NA,the producers should be givena fair deal'.,57
NA,"For the three years 1912, 1-913, 1914, the",57
NA,average production of butter in Australia,57
NA,"was 193,407,000 lb., the average value for",57
NA,"these: three years being £9,299,000.",57
NA,"Taking the three years 1920, 1921 and",57
NA,"1922, the average production was",57
NA,"236,716,000 lb.., the average value, for",57
NA,"these' three years being £2.0,237,000..",57
NA,Since the 1912 -14 period i t will be seen,57
NA,that the production of butter has. in-,57
NA,"creased 22 per cent., and the value",57
NA,by 120 per cent. I n view of the,57
NA,great expansion of the industry I,57
NA,urge the Government to give the,57
NA,producers some representation on the,57
NA,board.. I commend the honorable member,57
NA,for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) for his per-,57
NA,sistence in advocating the cause of the,57
NA,producers. Although he has not so far,57
NA,been successful in getting the Govern-,57
NA,"ment to accept any of his amendments, I",57
NA,"trust that he will continue to press them,",57
NA,and that success will ultimately come his,57
NA,way. The honorable member for Angas,57
NA,"should cease making pessimistic remarks,",57
NA,and follow the example of the honorable,57
NA,"member for Capricornia, who refuses to",57
NA,be discouraged by the repeated rejection,57
NA,of his proposals by the Government.,57
NA,Not one word has been said in justification,57
NA,of the proposal to hand over to the board,57
NA,complete control of the exportable sur-,57
NA,plus. * Paragraph c provides that two of,57
NA,the representatives shall be elected by,57
NA,the boards of directors of proprietary,57
NA,butter and cheese factories. The honor-,57
NA,able member for Capricornia has moved,57
NA,"for the deletion of that paragraph, and",57
NA,proposes to ask the committee to accept,57
NA,an amendment to provide for the repre-,57
NA,sentation of the producers supplying,57
NA,milk or cream to proprietary butter and,57
NA,cheese factories. Large quantities of these,57
NA,commodities will be under the control of,57
NA,the proposed hoard. For the three years,57
NA,"prior to the war (1912,, 1913', 1914)",57
NA,the average quantity of butter produced,57
NA,"in Australia was 193,407,000 l b , , the",57
NA,average value of such production being,57
NA,"£9,299,000. For the. same period the",57
NA,"average cheese production was 19,064,000",57
NA,"lb., the average value of such production",57
NA,"being £529,100. Since then tliere has",57
NA,been an enormous increase i n the output,57
NA,of both commodities. During the fast,57
NA,"three years (1920, 1921, 1922) the average",57
NA,"production, of butter reached 236,716,000",57
NA,"lb., the average value being. £20,327,000 ;",57
NA,while the average production of cheese,57
NA,"for the same period was 26,841,000 lb.,",57
NA,the average value of such production bet-,57
NA,"ing £1,226,731. Under the Government",57
NA,proposal the producers of butter and,57
NA,"cheese, numbering 150,000 persons,",57
NA,are to have no voice in the selection of,57
NA,the board. A l l they are asked to do is,57
NA,to vote for the acceptance of the scheme-.,57
NA,"I n 1912-13, 128,000 people wereengaged",57
NA,"in the dairying industry, and in 1913-14, !",57
NA,"131,000. The total value of the produc-",57
NA,"tion was about ,£20,000,000. To-day,",57
NA,"there are 150,000 people engaged in the",57
NA,"industry,, and the value of the production",57
NA,"is about £50,.000i,000, being increases' of",57
NA,"18 per cent, and 125 per cent, respec-",57
NA,"tively. The value, of the butter produc-",57
NA,"tion alone; since 1913-14, has. increased",57
NA,120 per cent. Yet the producers are mot,57
NA,to be permitted to have one representa-,57
NA,tive on the board of control.,57

Mr MCGRATH ,Ballarat) [1.30 a.m.].,58
NA,We have had only two days i n w i,58
NA,which to discuss an important bill,58
NA,involving the fate of many primary,58

NA,"urgent- notice of many amendments, yet the",58
NA,Prime Minister has the cool audacity,58

NA,right honorable the Prime Minister i m -,58
NA,pudently declares that a measure for the,58
NA,benefit of our dairy farmers must be,58
NA,passed within a few hours. That means,58
NA,that no amendment f o r its improvement,58
NA,can be moved by the members of the Op-,58

Mr R GREEN ,Yes . they can be,58
NA,moved.,58
NA,Mr M o GRATH - T h e honorable mem-,58
NA,"ber, although a Country party member,",58

NA,"is desirous to improve their conditions, yet",58
NA,"by voting to impose the "" gag "" he has pre-",58
NA,vented the possibility of amending the,58
NA,"bill. The object of the measure, as i t",58
NA,"stands, is to increase the profits of land-",58
NA,lords and the price of butter. Im-,58
NA,"mediately this measure becomes law, there",58
NA,"w i l l be a control of the export of butter,",58
NA,and the board w i l l see that enough butter,58
NA,is sent out of Australia to cause a local,58
NA,scarcity.,58
Mr R GREEN ,Tha t cannot be done.,58
NA,"Mr M c GRATH - A s a matter of fact,",58
NA,honorable members'of the Opposition are,58
NA,"foolish to discuss the bill, because after",58
NA,the next election Labour w i l l be i n power,58
NA,and w i l l take the earliest opportunity to,58
NA,alter this legislation. The Country party,58
NA,is not game to vote against the Govern-,58

NA,Members of the party are quite aware,58
NA,i n every state except New South,58
NA,"Wales, i t has recently appealed to the",58
NA,electors with disastrous results. :,58
NA,This,58
NA,b i l l is an attempt to restrict the supply of,58

NA,NA,58
NA,Mr M c GRATH - T h e honorable mem-,58
NA,remainber f o r Gippsland has put forward a,58
NA,silly proposal which would increase the,58
NA,price of butter by 3d. a lb. This b i l l,58
NA,l l also mean an increase i n the price,58
NA,"of butter, but the Government are not",58

NA,so that the only gainers by the passing of,59

NA,"a wife, and five children.",59
NA,Mr M c GRATH - T h e honorable,59

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,59
NA,The honorable member's time has exCountry,59

Mr FENTON ,Maribrynong) [i.38,59
NA,a.m.] - I am surprised that the Treasurer,59
NA,(Dr Earle Page) should be trying,59
NA,push business through i n an all-night chamber.,59
NA,"sitting. On the 11th Ootober. 1922, he",59
NA,said-,59
NA,"On behalf of my part}', I protest against",59
NA,Estimates involving* expenditure amounting,59
NA,"£84,000,000 being rushed through by means",59
NA,"all-night sittings, when every honorable mem-",59
NA,ber is jaded.,59
NA,On the 12th October he said-,59
NA,My experience has been that the man,59
NA,"has been working twenty-four hours, or",59
NA,"hours, without sleep, is not more than 50 per",59
NA,"cent, efficient, and probably not more than 25 state",59
NA,per cent.,59
NA,Yet here we have the honorable member,59
NA,trying to do the business of the Common-,59
NA,"wealth when he himself, according to his",59
NA,"own admission, is inefficient. We have",59
NA,ocular demonstration of the effect of,59
NA,night sittings. The Vice-President of the,59
NA,Executive Council slumbers on the Gobers,59
NA,"vernment bench, while others are trying",59
NA,to work. The honorable member for,59
NA,Henty has his head buried i,59
NA,presenting the spectaole of an intelligent,59
NA,legislator trying to do the business of the,59
NA,country at 1.40 a.m.,59
NA,Mr F . FRANCIS - I would rather,59
NA,at home.,59
Mr FENTON , I believe the honor-,59
NA,able member would rather be at home.,59
NA,"""What has I heard him telling the Prime Minister",59
NA,"that, although he admired him very",59
NA,"much, he did not admire his proclivities",59
NA,for all-night sittings. The honorable,59
NA,member for I n d i is almost asleep. Close,59
NA,by him is the honorable member for,59
NA,"Gippsland, also half asleep. We have",59
NA,this morning a slightly larger gallery,59
NA,than we usually have at these after mid-,59
NA,night farces we enact i n this Parliament.,59
NA,I t is i n a position to see what a sorry,59
NA,spectacle a so-called deliberative assembly,59
NA,presents in the early hours of the morning.,59
NA,I always protest against all-night sittings.,59
NA,We have almost until Christmas Eve to,59
NA,memcarry on the business of the country. The,59
NA,Government has threatened us with four-,59
NA,teen or fifteen other measures.,59
Mr MCGRATH , I s i t not disorderly to,59
NA,often read newspapers i n the chamber!,59
NA,The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN -,59
NA,I t is contrary to the Standing Orders to,59
NA,read newspapers i n the chamber. Honor-,59
NA,able members must not do so.,59
Mr FENTON ,Th e Leader of the,59

NA,who completion of the committee stage should,59

Mr BRENNAN ,I call attention to the,59
NA,of the committee. [Quorum,59
NA,formed.],59
Mr FENTON , I realize that my,59
NA,protest has fallen on deaf ears. During,59
NA,my fifteen years of parliamentary experi-,59
NA,allence I have never known an all-night,59

NA,as the result of train or steamer journeys,59
NA,"n a corner, f r o m other states.",59
Mr CUNNINGHAM ,Gwydir) [1.50,59

NA,"ture to say, of honorable members on",59
NA,"both, sides of the 'chamber.",60
NA,bills is to be brought down at the end,60
NA,of this session because of a similar pro-,60
NA,"cedure having been adopted last year,",60
NA,when the Prime Minister was packing his,60
NA,bag for his tour abroad.,60
NA,that all clauses up to clause 13 shall be,60
NA,"passed w i t h in the next hour or so, and",60
NA,in that time we are exjpected to agree to,60
NA,proposals of a most revolutionary,60
NA,character.,60
Mr JACKSON ,Th e time allotted is,60
NA,based on the speed at which the Bank-,60
NA,ruptcy B i l l was taken through committee.,60
NA,Mr CU i r a r i NGHAM - T h a t was not,60
NA,so contentious a measure as this.,60
NA,has been no obstruction by the Opposi-,60
NA,tion. Every honorable member who has,60
NA,spoken on this side of the chamber has,60
NA,been followed by a supporter of the Go-,60
NA,vernment. The consideration of clause,60
NA,13 alone might well occupy honorable,60
NA,members' time f o r a whole day.,60
NA,is no justification f o r this unseemly,60
NA,haste. Honorable members are paid to,60
NA,give f u l l consideration to the measures,60
NA,"brought before them, but the Prime M i n-",60
NA,ister has fixed the 8th October as the,60
NA,date for the commencement of his tour,60
NA,among the states to patch up the pact.,60
NA,I t is impossible to foresee how faT-reach-,60
NA,ing will be the effects of this ill-considered,60
NA,legislation. I f the whole of the present,60
NA,.week were allotted for the discussion of,60
NA,"the b i l l , i t would not be too much, n o n -",60
NA,"arable members, who speak airily about",60
NA,"disposing of the measure by 6 a.m., have",60
NA,-no personal knowledge of the require-,60
NA,ments of the dairying industry. I regard,60
NA,"the Prime Minister's plan as a "" strong",60
NA,man a c t ' ' for the purpose of silencing the,60
NA,"Opposition, but what about the interests",60
NA,of the thousands of dairy farmers,60
NA,throughout the Commonwealth who de-,60
NA,pend upon their representatives to give,60
NA,proper consideration to the legislation,60
NA,submitted to them ? There is no justifi-,60
NA,cation for the application of the guillo-,60
NA,tine to this measure. We are expected to,60
NA,"reach clause 21 by 4.30 a.m., but clause",60
NA,"19 is most contentious, and the committee",60
NA,might well have the considered opinion of,60
NA,every honorable member on such a revolu-,60
NA,tionary proposal. A t the end of last,60
NA,"session, the Prime Minister was evidently",60
NA,"not prepared to trust his colleague, the",60
NA,"Treasurer, to lead the House i n his ab-",60
NA,"sence abroad. To-day, however, he has no",60
NA,such excuse for the action he has taken.,60
NA,A crop of Ministers are returning and reinforcing,60
NA,t'he ranks of the Government. We have,60
NA,"before us now the genial, smiling counten-",60
NA,"ance of the Postmaster-General, who is",60
NA,fresh from his triumphs on the continent,60
NA,I t is proposed of Europe. B u t there is not now as there,60
NA,was last year an imperial conference about,60
NA,to be held. The empire does not require to,60
NA,be saved this year by the Prime Minis-,60
NA,ter-^-,60
Mr JACKSON ,Th e honorable member's,60
NA,leader is away i n Europe.,60
Mr CUNNINGHAM , H e did not ask,60
NA,that legislation should be passed hastily,60
NA,"to allow him to leave. He went, on public",60
NA,"business, at the invitation of this cham-",60
NA,"There ber. This is a highly intricate bill, that",60
NA,will affect the livelihood of many men who,60
NA,have built up their businesses by a great,60
NA,deal of bard work and application. I t is,60
NA,very unwise for a government to over-ride,60
NA,the business of any man. This Govern-,60
NA,ment stands for the principle of no inter-,60
NA,"There ference with private enterprise, yet i t i n -",60
NA,"tends to pass revolutionary measures, the",60
NA,effect of which no one can foresee. I hope,60
NA,that the committee will not agree to this,60
NA,"proposal, because there is absolutely no",60
NA,need for i t .,60
NA,The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN -,60
NA,The honorable member's time has expired.,60
Mr BRENNAN ,Batman) [2.1 a.m.].,60
NA,- W i t h i n the limited time that is allowed,60
NA,"me by our drastic Standing Orders, I wish",60
NA,to protest against the proposal of the,60
NA,Prime Minister. Such a course as he has,60
NA,"adopted is, i n the circumstances, ab-",60
NA,solutely unprecedented i n the history of,60
NA,this Parliament.,60
Mr JACKSON ,I draw attention to the,60
NA,state of the committee. [Quorum formed.],60
Mr BRENNAN , T h i s is a dishonest,60
NA,attempt to rush the bill through,60
NA,during unnatural working hours.,60
NA,If there were an honest desire,60
NA,to l i m i t the time to be devoted to,60
NA,"the discussion of the b i l l , a motion to that",60
NA,effect would have been moved yesterday,60
NA,-afternoon. This proposal is a calculated,60
NA,"insult to honorable members, and its ob-",60
NA,ject can be. only to provoke hon-,60
NA,"orable members, and not to expedite the",60
NA,business of the chamber. W e are all aware,60
NA,that there is no necessity to rush the,60
NA,measure through i n this way. The inter-,60
NA,ests of the country do not demand that,60
NA,the session be closed i n the manner,60
NA,so hysterically asked for. I am,60
NA,pleased to learn that at a meeting,60
NA,"held last evening, the honorable member",60
NA,for Wimmera ( Mr Stewart) had an en-,61
NA,thusiastic reception. I heartily agree with,61
NA,many of the observations that he made,61
NA,at that meeting. He is competent to,61
NA,"speak, because he has' an inside know-",61
NA,ledge of the workings of the Government.,61
NA,This is what a report of the meeting in,61
NA,this morning's newspaper states: -,61
NA,Several 'hundred members of the Victorian,61
NA,Farmers' Union crowded into Ansae House,61
NA,last night on the occasion of a smoke social,61
NA,"tendered to Messrs. P. G. Stewart, M.P., and",61
NA,"A. A. Dunstan, M.L.A., in recognition of the",61
NA,stand they have taken in the Federal and,61
NA,State. Parliaments in the interests of the,61
NA,V.F.U. Though they had been described as,61
NA,"rebels, said the chairman,, Mr J. J. Hall, the",61
NA,"organization was proud of such rebels, and i t",61
NA,was thought fitting in order to give them some,61
NA,encouragement in the great light they had,61
NA,"made, and the big fight they would be called",61
NA,upon to make ibefore the political crisis was,61
NA,"over, that a gathering representative of Vic-",61
NA,toria should throw its weight behind them,61
NA,"and assure them' that their actions, and utter-",61
NA,ances were an embodiment of the true spirit,61
NA,of tbe V.F.U. (Loud applause.).,61
NA,"This obvious, breaking up of the so-called",61
NA,pact has imbued the Government with a,61
NA,"desire to conclude the session, hurriedly,",61
NA,so as to allow the Prime Minister and the,61
NA,Treasurer to tour Australia i n an endeav-,61
NA,our to patch i t up. The report con-,61
NA,tinues-,61
NA,"In response to the toast of hisi health,",61
NA,"was enthusiastically honoured, Mr Stewart",61
NA,said the. distinct understanding when he joined,61
NA,tlie composite Government was that there,61
NA,"should be no pacts, and had 'he not received",61
NA,a solemn promise in tliis regard he would not,61
NA,"have joined the Ministry. However, lie felt",61
NA,compelled to say that the arrangement made,61
NA,between the leaders of tlie twoparties was,61
NA,the most flagrant example of endeavouring to,61
NA,run the movement from the top down instead,61
NA,of fromthe bottom up which he bad ever seen.,61
NA,I think i t must be admitted that that is,61
NA,how the Government is now-botto m up.,61
NA,Mr Stewart went on to say- :,61
NA,For years the two-party system: had prevailed,61
NA,-Labou r and anti-Laibour-th e latter under,61
NA,"variousnames, both of which claimed to be",61
NA,friends of the farmer. Whichever party was,61
NA,elected the primary producer always lost. So,61
NA,"the Country party was formed with. fine, ideals.",61
NA,With the baton in one hand and the search-,61
NA,light in tho other the leader of the Country,61
NA,party went into the dark places carrying the,61
NA,"fiery torch, and lighting not only political:",61
NA,"parties, but a hostile press, and in an incred-",61
NA,ibly short space of timeit became one of the,61
NA,most vital political forces in the Common-,61
NA,"wealth. (Oncers.) Now, however, the scene",61
NA,had changed . No longer was the Country,61
NA,1,61
NA,party carrying thebanner against a l l comers.,61
NA,"The- 'baton and tli«' searchlights were, in the",61
NA,"limbo of things forgotten,, and instead, the",61
NA,Country party had placed in its 'hands a sweet-,61
NA,"toned harp, and tho fighters of yesterday were",61
NA,sitting at the footstool of Nationalism striking,61
NA,chords of harmony and singing Love Me and,61
NA,the World is Mine. (Loud laughter.),61

Mr BRENNAN , I shall endeavour to,61
NA,do so. The report states further-,61
NA,And those few people who remembered the,61
NA,ideals that actuated the party of yesterday;,61
NA,"who remembered tlie commandeering of wheat,",61
NA,the fixation of prices by other people and other,61
NA,boards on: which the primary producerhad no,61

NA,"of the price of wheat, the crushing imposts of",61
NA,"a crushing, tariff and other: forms of taxation,",61
NA,"wore regarded as wreckers, agitators and rebels,",61
NA,because they stood tTue to their principles.,61
NA,(Applause.) ThePrime Minister hod taken,61
NA,"the opportunity at a non-party gathering, at",61
NA,the show to refer to a certain section as,61
NA,""" political blackmailers."" It. was pertinent to",61
NA,ask Mr Bruce who he meant. I f he did,61
NA,not mean theCountry party they owed hi'ir.,61
NA,"an apology. (Laughter.) ""if he was really",61
NA,"aiming at, the: harmony he spoke about i t",61
NA,wasa strange procedure at an agricultural,61
NA,gathering to make a covert attack on a certain,61
NA,section because it endeavoured to carry out,61
NA,its own political destiny. Tlie primary pro-,61
NA,ducers of this country did not deny the right,61
NA,to any section of the community to enter,61
NA,"tlie political field, and the Country party",61
NA,would insist on that privilege being granted,61
NA,which to it. (Cheers.)' Who - had a better right,61
NA,toa say in its political destiny tftam the,61
NA,"men who fought fire and flood, and drought?",61

NA,The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN -,61
NA,The honorable member's timehas expired.,61
Dr EARLE PAGE ,CoHvper-Tre a,61
NA,surer) [2.14 a.m.] - I should like to point,61
NA,"out to the committee, and, through the",61
NA,"committee, to the people of Australia, the",61
NA,manner i n which honorable members r.f,61
NA,the Opposition are dealing with this bill.,61
NA,The honorable member for Batman ( Mr.,61
NA,Brennan) spoke for nearly ten minutes-. He,61
NA,"dealt with many things, but he did not",61
NA,approach the subject of butter. I t was,61
NA,stated that the Opposition had mad'ei up,61
NA,its mind to> prevent the passage of the bill,61
NA,if that were possible.,61
Mr BRENNAN , I rise to a point of,61
NA,"order. I submit: that i t is quite, out of",61
NA,"harmony with our Standing Orders, and",61
NA,with parliamentary practice as laid down,61
NA,"by May and other authorities, for any",61
NA,honorable member of this chamber to,61
NA,accuse another honorable member oi,61
NA,deliberately obstructing legislation. Ib is,62
NA,particularly unbecoming for the Trea-,62
NA,surer to offend i n this way.,62
NA,misrepresented honorable members of the,62
NA,"party to which I belong, and his remarks",62
NA,are unfair and improper.' I request that,62
NA,they be withdrawn.,62
NA,f h e TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN - I,62
NA,ask the Treasurer to withdraw the re-,62
NA,marks that have been objected to.,62
NA,Dr EARLE PAGE . ^ - If the honorable,62
NA,member for Batman ( Mr Brennan) con-,62
NA,siders my remark that the Opposition has,62
NA,obstructed the passage of this bill to be,62
NA,"offensive, I withdraw i t , but I shall say",62
NA,that the tactics of the Opposition have,62
NA,every appearance of being obstructive.,62
NA,Since the conclusion of the second-read-,62
NA,"ing debate on this measure, the Oppo-",62
NA,"sition has attempted to prevent progress,",62
NA,and every member opposite who has ad-,62
NA,"dressed the committee has "" flogged "" the",62
NA,same arguments. The widest latitude,62
NA,was given during the second-reading,62
NA,debate.,62
Mr BRENNAN , I had a speech pre-,62
NA,pared for delivery i n the second-reading,62
NA,"debate, but I was prevented f r o m deliver-",62
NA,ing i t .,62
Dr EARLE PAGE , I f the honor-,62
NA,"orable member had been here, he would",62
NA,"have been able to deliver his speech, for",62
NA,the second-reading debate ended quite,62
NA,naturally. No pressure was applied by,62
NA,"the Government, and no division was",62
NA,called for. The principles to which the,62
NA,bill is designed to give effect are well,62
NA,"known to the dairy farmers, and have",62
NA,been discussed publicly for many months.,62
NA,The Government is aiming i n the bill to,62
NA,"do two things, namely, to provide a",62
NA,board of a satisfactory kind to control,62
NA,the export of dairy produce and to clothe,62
NA,the board with sufficient power to make,62
NA,its work effective. There is still a con-,62
NA,siderable time i n which .these matters,62
NA,may be discussed.,62
Mr BRENNAN ,Th e members,62
NA,Corner party have done their fair share,62
NA,in this debate.,62
Dr EARLE PAGE , A n d every time,62
NA,any member of that party has spoken,62
NA,"he has given some fresh information, or",62
NA,revealed a new point of view. The Act-,62
NA,ing Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,62
NA,"Anstey), on the other hand, in his",62
NA,speeches has repeated the same remarks,62
NA,time after time - He admitted that i n,62
NA,one speech this evening he had made a,62
NA,"certain ntatement six times,",62
NA,he stated that he repeated this statement,62
NA,"for fche purpose of emphasis, i t seemed",62
NA,He has to honorable members on this side of the,62
NA,"chamber, who had to listen to him, that",62
NA,he was indulging i n wearisome reitera-,62
NA,tion. I t is necessary that this bill should,62
NA,be passed as soon as possible i n order,62
NA,that the export trade of the approaching,62
NA,season may be properly handled. I,62
NA,am sure that the general public w i l l recog-,62
NA,nize that the Government has provided,62
NA,ample time f o r the discussion of the mea-,62
NA,"sure, and that there is still time f o r the",62
NA,committee to discuss adequately all the,62
NA,matters that need discussion.,62
Mr ANSTEY ,The n why does not the,62
NA,Treasurer allow those who want .to speak,62
NA,on the provisions of the bill to do so?,62
NA,He himself is adopting an obstructionist,62
NA,policy. * i,62
Mr BRENNAN ,Ther e is an Australian,62
NA,way of conducting parliamentary business,62
NA,and there is also a Prussian way.,62
Dr EARLE PAGE , I t is no good f o r,62
NA,the honorable member to t r y to draw a red,62
NA,herring across .the t r a i l. The only ones,62
NA,who are attempting to obstruct the mea-,62
NA,sure are honorable members opposite.,62
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,62
NA,The Treasurer's time has expired.,62
Mr R GREEN , I wish to move-,62
NA,That the question be now put.,62
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,62
NA,The honorable member f o r Angas.,62
Mr BRENNAN , O n a point of order.,62
NA,I submit that i t is not competent f o r,62
NA,the honorable member f o r Richmond to,62
NA,move that motion.,62
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , I,62
NA,have not accepted i t . I have called on,62
NA,the honorable member f o r Angas ( Mr .,62
NA,Gabb).,62
Mr GABB ,Angas) [2.26 a.m.] - I,62
NA,strongly protest against being obliged to,62
NA,of the,62
NA,suffer an all-night sitting on the,62
NA,first sitting day of the week. I,62
NA,and some other honorable members,62
NA,"were i n the train all last night,",62
NA,and i t is not f a i r that we should,62
NA,'be compelled to remain here u n t i l this,62
NA,hour of the morning. I have been a,62
NA,"member of this Parliament f o r five years,",62
NA,and although I thought that the right,62
NA,honorable member f o r Nort h Sydney,62
NA,"( Mr V . M . Hughes), when Prime",62
NA,"Although Minister, was bad enough i n the demands",62
NA,lie made on the time of honorable mem-,63
NA,"bers, he never stooped so low as the",63
NA,"present Prime Minister, in obliging us to",63
NA,remain i n this building under such,63
NA,"unreasonable conditions. ""Where is there",63
NA,any urgency for the passing of this bill?,63
Mr MARR ,Th e honorable member's,63
NA,party is responsible f o r the urgency.,63
Mr GABB , I f the fact that we are,63
NA,putting up a fight f o r the producers is,63
NA,"sufficient to make the matter urgent, then",63
NA,"I suppose we are responsible, but I think",63
NA,the real reason f o r the urgency is to be,63
NA,found i n the speech made last night,63
NA,by the honorable member for W i m-,63
NA,"mera ( Mr Stewart), i n another place,",63
NA,which the honorable member for Bat-,63
NA,man ( Mr Brennan ) 1,63
NA,So far as the bill itself is con-,63
NA,"cerned, there is no need f o r urgency or",63
NA,hurry. The Treasurer stated just now,63
NA,that the Government had provided abun-,63
NA,dant time f o r the second-reading debate.,63
NA,That is so. This Government always,63
NA,provides plenty of time f o r the discussion,63
NA,"of generalities, but i t never allows suffi-",63
NA,cient time to discuss the details of the,63
NA,legislation i t introduces. I ask the Prime,63
NA,"Minister to deny, i f he can, that the",63
NA,"principal clauses i n this measure, which",63
NA,relate to the powers to be conferred upon,63
NA,"the export control board, are i n clauses",63
NA,14 to 20. Yet he has the darned cheek,63
NA,to ask us to discuss those clauses and vote,63
NA,on them i n an hour and a half.,63
Mr BRUCE ," I rise to a point of order. Johnson, Sir Elliot",63
NA,Por the proper conduct of the business,63
NA,"of this committee, I must protest against",63
NA,"the use of the words "" darned cheek "" by",63
NA,the honorable member f o r Angas. I sug-,63
NA,gest that they are not parliamentary.,63
Mr GABB ," I f the words ""darned",63
NA,"cheek"" are distasteful to the Prime",63
NA,"Minister, I shall withdraw them, but they",63
NA,arc not nearly so distasteful as language,63
NA,which the Prime Minister himself has,63
NA,used in private conversation to which I,63
NA,have been (Compelled to listen. His lan-,63
NA,guage has been far more distasteful to me,63
NA,"than these words can be to him, and yet I",63
NA,have had to put up with i t . I t is time,63
NA,he abandoned such mock modesty as to,63
NA,"pretend that the words "" darned cheek""",63
NA,are offensive.,63

NA,Question so resolved i n the affirmative.,63
Mr FORDE ,Oapricornia) [2.37 a.m.]..,63
NA,"-Befor e my amendment goes to a vote,",63
NA,I should like to know whether the Prime,63
NA,Minister intends to accept i t . There is,63
NA,a big principle involved. The party to,63
NA,which I belong has always stood for the,63
NA,widest possible franchise. I n this case,63
NA,honorable members of the Country party,63
NA,should not object to the extension of the,63
NA,franchise to producers supplying milk or,63
NA,cream t o the proprietary factories in,63
NA,order that they may have some :say in the,64
NA,election .of the representatives,64
NA,board of those concerns. Eor the last six,64
NA,or eight months I have been consistently,64
NA,urging the Government to do something,64
NA,for the dairy farmers of the Common--,64
NA,"wealth, but I have been disappointed at",64
NA,the unsympathetic reception of my pro-,64
NA,posals by certain honorable members sup-,64
NA,porting the Government. When,64
NA,estimates of the Prime Minister's,64
NA,"partment were under discussion,",64
NA,moved for their reduction,64
NA,as an instruction to the Government,64
NA,to introduce the stabilization,64
NA,outlined by the interstate -dairy confer-,64
NA,"ence in April, and again in Jnly of this",64
NA,year for the marketing of dairy,64
NA,My proposal was for the appointment of,64
NA,a tribunal to inquire into all phases of,64
NA,"the dairying industry in Australia,",64
NA,"ascertain what was wrong, and to fix a",64
NA,"reasonable price for the producer, based",64
NA,on the cost of production.,64
NA,"members of the Country party,",64
NA,"might have been expected to endorse -it,",64
NA,failed to do so. The honorable,64
NA,NA,64
NA,"tion of his attitude, said. that the Prime",64
NA,Minister had definitely promised to intro-,64
NA,duce legislation before the session closed.,64
NA,He knew quite well that the Government,64
NA,did not propose to deal with two-thirds of,64
NA,the Australian butter production that is,64
NA,absorbed by the home market.,64
NA,that the scheme which the Government,64
NA,had in contemplation would -deal only,64
NA,with the exportable surplus. The honor-,64
NA,able member for Moreton,64
NA,"Francis), congratulated the Government",64
NA,upon already having promised to intro-,64
NA,"duce the necessary legislation, and added",64
NA,that he proposed to postpone his criticism,64
NA,until he had the bill before him.,64
NA,also knew that the Government's.,64
NA,posals would refer only to the exportable,64
NA,surplus. The honorable member for Wide,64
NA,"-Bay pilr. Corser), referring to my amend-",64
NA,"ment, declared that I was uselessly occu-",64
NA,"pying the time of the committee,",64
NA,the Prime Minister had promised to in-,64
NA,"troduce legislation, and 'that when the",64
NA,bill was before the House honorable mem-,64
NA,bers would have an opportunity to 'show,64
NA,whether they approved of the policy laid,64
NA,down. He also expressed the hope that,64
NA,when I had been a little longer in this,64
NA,"Parliament, and had acquired a little",64
NA,"more sense., I would deal with the 'prob-",64
NA,lems that came before me in a business-,64
NA,Mr Forde.,64
NA,"l i t e way. He, too, decided to withhold",64
NA,on the his criticism until 'the Government policy,64
NA,had been announced. A l l the honorable,64
NA,members .to whom I have referred (en-,64
NA,deavoured t o throw cold water upon my,64
NA,"proposal, which has been unanimously",64
NA,supported by dairymen throughout Aus-,64
NA,tralia. One would think that members,64
NA,of the Country party had never adopted,64
NA,"the a similar course. I find, however., ""that",64
NA,"De- on the 19th October, .1921, .the Treasurer",64
NA,"I (Dr. Earle Page)., then Leader of the",64
NA,"by £1, Country party, moved for the reduction",64
NA,"of .the Defence Estimates by 10s., as an",64
NA,scheme instruction to the Government to take a,64
NA,certain course of action i n the interests of,64
NA,the primary producers. On that occasion,64
NA,products. he .was supported by members of the,64
NA,Labour parity.. . We did not make i t a,64
NA,"party issue, but voted for the amendment",64
NA,to in the belief that the course suggested,64
NA,would be i n the best interests of Aus-,64
NA,"tralia. Again, on the 17th November.,",64
NA,"Honorable 1921;, 'the present .Treasurer moved for a",64
NA,"who reduction o'f £400,000 i n the Defence",64
NA,"Estimates, and again he was supported",64
NA,member by members of the Labour party. I quote,64
NA,these instances to show that when,64
NA,I moved for the reduction of,64
NA,tlie Prime Minister's Estimates I,64
NA,was following sound precedent es-,64
NA,tablished by the Treasurer himself.,64

NA,"He knew bers opposite, who, although professing to",64

NA,This proposal should commend itself,65
NA,honorable members i f they were prepared,65
NA,to give i t detached and impartial,65

NA,give the primary producers representation,65
NA,on the board. The omission of the proI,65
NA,vision he proposes would create a radical,65
NA,defect i n the bill . What is lacking i n the Parliament.,65

NA,proposal to which the Government is apbut,65
NA,parently committed-tw o representatives,65
NA,to be elected by the boards of directors,65

NA,directs a good deal of suspicion at the,65

NA,[3.13 a.m.] -Th e honorable member's,66
NA,purpose is evidently to make i t unnecessupported,66
NA,sary to obtain a licence to export butter,66
NA,to eastern ports. A much simpler way,66
NA,of achieving that object would be -to i,66
NA,"sert the words "" t o E u r o p e "" after",66

NA,such au amendment would be to l i m i,66

Mr CUNNINGHAM ,Tha t would place,66
NA,at a disadvantage exporters who wished,66
NA,to send butter to Europe and re-ship i t to,66
NA,the East. What w i l l be the position of,66
NA,those who export to the East and re-ship,66
NA,to Europe?,66
Mr BRUCE , I t is not proposed to,66
NA,apply the act to those who ship butter to,66
NA,"the East. This b i l l has one purpose only,",66
NA,and that is to bring about a more orderly-,66
NA,system of selling Australian dairy pro-,66
NA,duce i n the markets which have already,66
NA,"been opened up, and i n which our efforts",66
NA,are handicapped by the inadequacy of,66
NA,our arrangements. Those markets are i n,66
NA,countries. This measure,66
NA,"is not designed to hamper, the",66
NA,trade we are now opening up,66

NA,may be i n a position to gain.,66

Mr R GREEN ,Richmond) [3.16,66
NA,a.m.] - I regret to say that the Prime,66
NA,Minister has accepted an apparently i n -,66
NA,nocuous amendment that will deal a death-,66
NA,blow to the bill. H a d he suggested that,66
NA,the board might prohibit the export of,66
NA,"any dairy produce overseas, except i n",66
NA,"accordance with the licence, I should not",66
NA,and have objected. I pointed out i n m y,66
NA,insecond-reading speech that butter could be,66
NA,"sold ostensibly to a buyer i n South A f r i c a ,",66
NA,"without regard to the board,",66
NA,yet its ultimate destination,66
NA,be Great Britain or the,66
NA,continent of Europe -The amendment,66
NA,by the Prime Minister gives,66
NA,opportunities f o r defeating the whole,66
NA,"spirit of the bill, and I strongly protest",66
NA,n - against i t . I f i t is agreed to by the,66
NA,"the committee, the measure may as well be",66
NA,basket.,66
NA,"t Apart f r o m the Eastern markets, there",66
NA,are the South A f r i c a n and other markets,66
NA,to be considered. The board should have,66
NA,control of the whole of the export. I f,67
NA,"it is desired to exclude the Eastern trade,",67
NA,it is unnecessary to make a stipulation,67
NA,"to that effect i n the bill, since the board",67
NA,could approve of regulations that would,67
NA,be sufficient to exempt that trade.,67
NA,amendment that I had drafted provided,67
NA,that the board should determine from,67
NA,time to time the extent to which it was,67
NA,necessary for i t to exercise control over,67
NA,the export of dairy produce from Aus-,67
NA,tralia. The control could then be either,67
NA,absolute or limited. I f we de-,67
NA,liberately confine the operation of the,67
NA,"clause to the European trade, we shall kill",67
NA,"the bill, and all the time spent on the",67
NA,"measure will have been wasted, for it",67
NA,will not achieve its object.,67
Mr BRUCE ,Flinders-Prim e Minis-,67
NA,ter and Minister for External Affairs),67
NA,[8.25 a.m.] -Th e scheme of the bill is,67
NA,that the board shall have the right to lay,67
NA,down the terms and conditions upon,67
NA,which butter may be exported from Aus-,67
NA,tralia. But the licence to export will,67
NA,"be issued by the Minister, who will thus",67
NA,retain control. The honorable member,67
NA,for Richmond asks that the board shall be,67
NA,"given complete control, but the Govern-",67
NA,ment cannot accept his suggestion. Nor,67
NA,does the Government intend that the board,67
NA,shall have partial control. Our proposal,67
NA,is that the board shall lay down the terms,67
NA,and conditions under which licences to,67
NA,"export shall be issued, and when licences",67
NA,"have been issued by the Minister, there",67
NA,will be nothing to prevent export through,67
NA,the ordinary channels. The measure is,67
NA,designed to utilize those channels to the,67
NA,"maximum of their efficiency, to assist the",67
NA,producer to realize the full value of his,67
NA,product. But I wish to make it clear,67
NA,that there is no power i n the bill for the,67
NA,board to take over the control of butter.,67
Mr GABB ,There the bill is weaker,67
NA,than the New Zealand act.,67
Mr BRUCE ,Yes. I t would be use-,67
NA,less to give the board power to assume,67
NA,"control, because the bill is limited to ex-",67
NA,"port butter, and it is impossible to say",67
NA,what is export butter until there ifi a,67
NA,declaration to the Customs. There would,67
NA,be no compulsion on anybody to declare,67
NA,"butter for export, and the probable effect the East?",67
NA,"of compulsion, i f i t were exercised, would",67
NA,be to do the greatest possible harm to,67
NA,producers. The Minister will issue,67
NA,licences only on the terms and conditions,67
NA,determined by the board. I am not sug-,67
NA,gesting how the board may exercise its,67
NA,"powers. One suggestion made was, I",67
NA,"The think, that a proprietary company,",67
NA,"through its agency, should determine the",67
NA,quantity of butter that should be placed,67
NA,on the market in any particular week.,67
NA,That might be one of the conditions of,67
NA,the licence. I t is contemplated that the,67
NA,control of the board will be exercised,67
NA,through the power to lay down the terms,67
NA,and conditions upon which licences to,67
NA,export may be issued by the Minister.,67
NA,Mr R. GEEEJT -I n what way does the,67
NA,right honorable gentleman contend that,67
NA,shipment through South Africa will be,67
NA,prevented ?,67
Mr BRUCE ,Tha t is the second point,67
NA,with which I wish to deal. I n the bill,67
NA,power is given to the board to take con-,67
NA,trol of produce that is voluntarily placed,67
NA,in its hands by the owner. I f the board,67
NA,carries out with conspicuous success the,67
NA,"work that is entrusted to it, it is quite",67
NA,possible that in future a large number,67
NA,of persons will voluntarily place their,67
NA,butter in its hands and ask it to export,67
NA,and market it. Even i f compulsory,67
NA,powers were conferred they would be of,67
NA,"no effect, because there is not in the bill",67
NA,a provision to compel anybody to export,67
NA,butter. I come now to the contention,67
NA,of the honorable member for Richmond,67
NA,( Mr R. Green). I t is not intended to,67
NA,interfere with the eastern trade that we,67
NA,"have been building up. I f , after further",67
NA,"consideration, it is found that i t is not",67
NA,"possible, by regulation, to prevent a sale",67
NA,"to 'a dummy in, say, South Africa, or",67
NA,other manipulations by which butter could,67
NA,be placed on the European market free,67
NA,"from control, I assure the honorable mem-",67
NA,ber that i n another place steps will be,67
NA,taken to exclude the eastern trade. There,67
NA,is nothing in the argument that the powers,67
NA,"of the board will be weakened, because it",67
NA,has never been contemplated that the,67
NA,board should have the power to specify,67
NA,"the quantity to be exported, ""or the places",67
NA,to which it shall go.,67
Mr FORDE ,Wh y should the board not,67
NA,be given the power to control export to,67
Mr BRUCE ,Fo r the reason that i t,67
NA,"the is unnecessary at this stage, and because",67
NA,the board w i l l - be f u l l y employed,68
NA,i n solving the problem of the orderly,68
NA,marketing of our butter production,68
NA,"on the European market, which is",68
NA,an urgent matter at present.,68
Mr CUNNINGHAM ,Gwydir) [3.35,68
NA,a.m.] - I cannot take the optimistic view,68
NA,that is held by the right honorable gentleI,68
NA,"man,, particularly as I have a vivid recolsee.",68
NA,lection of the control that was exercised,68
NA,by various boards and committees which,68
NA,were appointed by anti-Labour Govern-,68
NA,ments during and since the,68
NA,agree with the honorable member for,68
NA,Richmond.,68
Mr COOK ,I s the honorable member,68
NA,opposed to< his leader?,68
Mr CUNNINGHAM , I am opposed,68
NA,to the provision that he has suggested.,68
NA,I f a i l to see why similar provisions,68
NA,not be made f o r both sections of the,68
NA,The board at a later stage may desire to Company.,68
NA,improve the marketing methods i n the,68
NA,East. The honorable member f o r K a l -,68
NA,goorlie ( Mr A . Green) a few days ago,68
NA,pointed out the awfu l mistakes that,68
NA,been made by private enterprise i n con-,68
NA,nexion with our trade to the East. The,68
NA,board would be prohibited f r o m dealing,68
NA,w i th that phase of the matter.,68
NA,Prime Minister's amendment limits containly,68
NA,trol to the export of butter to Europe.,68
NA,soon as a vessel is outside the 3-milc l i,68
NA,the Commonwealth w i l l have no control,68
NA,"over its cargoes, and w i l l not be able",68

NA,"sidiary companies which, being regisartificial",68
NA,"tered under Asiatic laws, w i l l be beyond",68
NA,the control of the Commonwealth. I am,68
NA,not prepared to accept the assurance of,68
NA,the P r i m e Minister. I disagree materibehind,68
NA,ally w i th his contention that no power,68
NA,to control export is proposed to be,68
NA,given tothe'board. I direct his,68
NA,"tion to paragraphs a, 6, and c of clause",68
NA,"20, which confer very wide powers upon",68
NA,the board. That clause says-,68
NA,Without limiting any authority,68
NA,cifically conferred on the board with respect,68
NA,"to any dairy produce placed under its control,",68
NA,tbe board shall have full authority to make,68
NA,such arrangements and give such directions,68
NA,as i t thinks fit for the following matters :-,68
NA,"(a) The handling, marketing, and storing",68
NA,pf dairy produce.,68
NA,(6) The shipment of dairy produce on such,68
NA,terms and i n such quantities as i t,68
NA,thinks' f i t.,68
NA,(c) The sale and disposal of dairy pro-,68
NA,duce on such terms as i t thinks fit.,68
NA,n no case is mention made of the licen-,68
NA,The board may grant a licence to,68
NA,"export, but i t can say, "" You can export",68
NA,"only 1,000 cases under your licence."" I t",68
NA,is virtually made supreme.,68
Mr FOSTER , I t will be elected for,68
NA,war. I quite only twelve months.,68
Mr CUNNINGHAM ,A man's busi-,68
NA,"ness can ""go to the dogs "" in thr«.e",68
NA,"months, or even in one month. Who, when",68
NA,the Central Wool Committee was brought,68
NA,"into existence, believed that men would",68
NA,"be prevented from exporting wool from,",68
NA,should fellmongered skins ? That is what hap-,68
NA,trade. pened to the firm of F. W. Hughes and,68
NA,Does any honorable member,68
NA,imagine tbat the board will not exercise,68
NA,its powers to the fullest extent 1,68
Mr FOSTER , I n the interests of the,68
NA,had people by whom i t is to be elected.,68
Mr CUNNINGHAM , Opinions,68
NA,differ greatly regarding what are the i n -,68
NA,terests of the people by whom the board,68
NA,The is to be elected. The exporters will cer-,68
NA,"have a voice i n the matter, but",68
NA,As they will be i n a big minority on the,68
NA,"m i t board, and will not be able to exercise a",68
NA,v e r,68
NA,y great influence upon its discussions. I,68
NA,to believe that the board w i l l have very much,68
NA,a wider powers of control than the Prime,68
NA,"There are, Minister asserts to be the case. I f export",68
NA,"gento the East is uncontrolled, i t will be",68
NA,a possible to ship to Europe under any con-,68
NA,ditions hundreds of thousands of tons of,68
NA,to butter. We are assured by the Leader,68
NA,of the Country party (Dr Earle Page),68
NA,that i t will not be possible to create an,68
NA,shortage of butter in Australia,68
NA,under the provisions of this bill. Those,68
NA,who are engaged i n the business and have,68
NA,capital to the extent of millions of pounds,68
NA,them will very easily be able to,68
NA,create a shortage i n Australia coinciden-,68
NA,tally -with a shortage i n Europe. When,68
NA,attenhigh prices are ruling i n Europe there,68
NA,will be nothing to prevent them from,68
NA,buying large quantities of butter i n Aus-,68
NA,tralia ostensibly for shipment to the,68
NA,East. I challenge the Prime Minister,68
NA,speand the supporters of this proposal to,68
NA,prove that I am wrong i n saying that,68
NA,i t will be possible to consign first of all,68
NA,to an Asiatic port and then re-consign to,69
NA,Europe..,69
NA,NA,69
NA,thing to do.,69
Mr CUNNINGHAM , T h e statement,69
NA,has been made that we control 95 per,69
NA,"cent, of the export, of butter to the East.",69
NA,Admittedly there isnot a very great,69
NA,"quantity of butter consumed there, be-",69
NA,cause of the inability of the inhabitants,69
NA,to purchase i t . Representative journals,69
NA,of the dairymen i n Australia have,69
NA,pointed out that the price of butter is,69
NA,to-day too high to allow even the B r i -,69
NA,tisher to purchase the amount that he,69
NA,should purchase i n order to maintain,69
NA,his health at the proper standard.,69
Mr FENTON ,I call attention,69
NA,state of the committee.,69
NA,formed.],69
Mr CUNNINGHAM , A paragraph,69
NA,that was published i n the New Zealand,69
NA,"Dairyman on the 20th October, 1923,",69
NA,gives some figures to show how butter,69
NA,and cheese is put* on the British market,69
NA,during the twelve months. I shall quote,69
NA,"them, for they w i l l doubtless be interest-",69
NA,ing to dairy producersi n Australia. They,69
NA,are as follow:-,69
NA,"January ... 24,200 ...",69
NA,"February ... 19,500 ...",69
NA,"March 21,000 ...",69
NA,"April 1.9,000 ... 14,000",69
NA,"May 23,700 ...",69
NA,"June 19,000 ...",69
NA,"July T7,700 ...",69
NA,"August ... 13',700: ... I3;600",69
NA,"September ... 10,800 ...",69
NA,"October ... 10,000 .... 11,000",69
NA,November ... 15.500 ...,69
NA,"December ... 21,000' ...",69
NA,The letterpress which followed the table,69
NA,read as follows:-,69
NA,"England requires each month 20,000 tons",69
NA,"butter and 10,000 tons of cheese. For the",69
NA,ended 30th June both these quantities have,69
NA,"been exceeded, and constitute a record, except",69
NA,"in one instance, when 2,000 tons more cheese",69
NA,was received in one twelve months. The,69
NA,tion we have to face now is this :: We,69
NA,either got tofind fresh markets or accept,69
NA,"prices. I t is true that there are 2,000,000",69
NA,people now resident in England and Scotland,69
NA,"than in 1914, in spite of the losses during",69
NA,"war. I t is also true that some 250,000 tons",69
NA,"margarineare consumed each year, aud that",69
NA,is the only outlet for further supplies of butter.,69
NA,As the price of butter falls so tlie output,69
NA,"margarine will be decreased, but while butter",69
NA,"remains at its present, high price theoutput",69
NA,margarine is more likely to be increased than,69
NA,otherwise. At present both butter and cheese,69
NA,are too high in price to be within the reach,69
NA,the bulk of the working population of the Old,69
NA,Country.,69
NA,"Therefore,, they eat margarine. That",69
NA,fact is particularly important to butter,69
NA,producers i n Australia. I t indicates to,69
NA,me that our dairymen cannot expect to,69
NA,obtain very much greater returns from,69
NA,the sale of their produce overseas. Only,69
NA,one-third of Australia's dairy production,69
NA,is exported. According to figures,69
NA,quoted by the honorable member for,69
NA,"Capricornia,. the average return, to the",69
NA,dairymen of Queensland is £ 2 10s. per,69
NA,week. I think that that figure is a bat,69
NA,low to take as a general average for Aus-,69
NA,"tralia, for I have, no doubt t h a t many of",69
NA,the Queensland dairymenare new to the,69
NA,"business, and that many men who send",69
NA,their produce to the factories are only,69
NA,to the giving part of their time to the industry.,69
NA,[Quorum I t is also probable that their herds are,69
NA,not of the same high quality aa those of,69
NA,Victoria and. parts of New South Wales.,69
NA,"Mr J. FRANCIS -Queenslan d pro-""",69
NA,duces more butter than Victoria.,69
NA,Mr CUNNINGHAM . - T h a t may be,69
NA,"so, but the herds i n that, state are not",69
NA,as good as the -herds i n the states where,69
NA,fche industry has been established for,69
NA,many more years than i t has been i n,69
NA,"Queensland, where i t is only now begin-",69
NA,Tons Butter . Tons Cheese. ning to develop-. I t isimpossible to,69
NA,"7,800- build up a good dairy herd i n a few",69
NA,"11,200 years. I t takes anything u p to 100 years",69
NA,"7,000 to get a first class herd together.",69
NA,"11,000 Mr J. FRANCIS - I t was done i n Den-",69
NA,"13,200 mark i n 28: years.",69
Mr CUNNINGHAM , T h e conditions,69
NA,"12,600 in Denmark are very different fro m those",69
NA,"in Australia. I n Denmark,, on account",69
NA,"7,800 of the intense culture' that is necessary,",69
NA,"5,800 every head of stock counts, and the dairy",69
NA,farmers have to take much more care to,69
NA,have good cattle than do the dairy,69
NA,of farmers of Australia. I speak from per-,69
NA,year sonal experience when I say that i t takes,69
NA,"many years to build up a good herd, for",69
NA,we have had one strain of cattle on OUT,69
NA,"posif a r m for 40 years, and i t is not yet",69
NA,have perfect. Even assuming that this board,69
NA,"lower will be most successful, i t cannot do a",69
NA,more great deal to help the dairy farmers. L e t,69
NA,"the us say, f o r the sake of argument, that",69
NA,of the average returnto the dairy farmers of,69
NA,Australia is £3 per week. As only one-third,69
NA,"of their produce is exported, theirexport",69
NA,"of return is only £ 1 per week. I f , as tbe",69
NA,"of result of the operations of this board,",69
NA,the export return wasi increased by 50 per,69
NA,"cent., thedairy farmers: would only be",69
NA,of 10s. a week better off. I do not think that,69
NA,"the increased return will, be anything like",69
NA,"50 per cent. I f there is a 10 per cent,",70
NA,increase the dairy farmers may consider,70
NA,"themselves fortunate, and 10 per cent,",70
NA,of £ 1 is only 2s. I f the increase were,70
NA,"25 per cent, the producers would only be",70
NA,5s. a week better-off. This board will be,70
NA,"expensive, and there will be considerable",70
NA,"overhead charges in Great Britain, as",70
NA,well as in Australia. The Prime Minister,70
NA,has stated that if the board is a success,70
NA,the producers will probably voluntarily,70
NA,place their produce under its control. I,70
NA,suggest that as the board will have so,70
NA,"much power to grant or refuse licences,",70
NA,it will in a comparatively short space of,70
NA,"time became tho chief, i f not the only,",70
NA,"exporter of butter from Australia, in much",70
NA,the same way as the Central Wool Com-,70
NA,mittee became the only exporter of wool.,70
NA,I disagree with the Prime Minister's,70
NA,view that the powers of the board are,70
NA,clearly defined. I t seems to me that a,70
NA,"great deal has been left indefinite, and",70
NA,in the circumstances i t is unlikely that,70
NA,private persons will care to venture their,70
NA,money in an export trade which is con-,70
NA,trolled by this board. I f they do they,70
NA,may be placed in a position similar to,70
NA,that in which certain wool-dealing firms,70
NA,found themselves in consequence of the,70
NA,operations of the Central Wool Com-,70
NA,mittee. Their operations would be so,70
NA,seriously hampered that i t would not pay,70
NA,them to carry on.,70
Mr COOK ,Woul d the honorable mem-,70
NA,ber abolish control altogether?,70
Mr CUNNINGHAM ,No ; but I do,70
NA,not accept the interpretation placed upon,70
NA,the provision by the right honorable the,70
NA,"Prime Minister, and I trust that the com-",70
NA,"mittee will not agree to eliminate control,",70
NA,so far as the East is concerned. There is,70
NA,nothing in the bill to prevent shipments,70
NA,of butter from being sent to the East in,70
NA,"cold storage, and then re-consigned to",70
NA,some European port. The door is left,70
NA,open for smart individuals in the trade,70
NA,to drive a coach and four through the act.,70
NA,Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [4.2 a.m.],70
NA,-Genera l approval has been expressed by,70
NA,producers i n Queensland of the powers to,70
NA,oe conferred upon the board under clause,70
NA,"14, but the fear is expressed that clause",70
NA,17 may materially weaken that provision.,70
NA,I shall be glad i f the right honorable,70
NA,Prime Minister will indicate to the com-,70
NA,mittee what is the purport of clause 17.,70
Mr BRUCE ,Flinders-Prim e Minis-,70
NA,ter and Minister for External Affairs),70
NA,[4.3 a.m.]-Th e honorable member for,70
NA,"Moreton has suggested that clause 17,",70
NA,which gives to the board power to accept,70
NA,control of dairy produce intended for ex-,70
NA,"port, may weaken the provisions of clause",70
NA,14. (That is not so. Clause 17 does not,70
NA,"in any - way affect clause 14, which sets",70
NA,out the terms upon which licences may,70
NA,be issued by the Minister for Trade and,70
NA,Customs for the export of butter. Clause,70
NA,17 in no sense limits those terms or con-,70
NA,ditions. I t does not interfere with the,70
NA,"ownership of the product, or the ordinary",70
NA,channels through which it may go. I t,70
NA,merely provides for the actual taking,70
NA,"over of control by the board, at the re-",70
NA,quest of the owner. Further particular,70
NA,powers are given to the board under clause,70
NA,"20, but neither clause 17 nor clause 20",70
NA,will in any way weaken the provisions of,70
NA,clause 14.,70
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [4.7 a.m.],70
NA,- I do not think the honorable member,70
NA,for Gwydir ( Mr Cunningham) need have,70
NA,any apprehension about the Eastern,70
NA,"trade. I t is already well established, and",70
NA,"we hold from 90 per cent, to 95 per cent,",70
NA,of it.,70
Mr CUNNINGHAM , I was referring to,70
NA,the illegitimate traders who might use,70
NA,that avenue to defeat the objects of the,70
NA,bill.,70
Mr FENTON , I doubt i f that would,70
NA,"be possible, for the simple reason that, for",70
NA,our European export trade we use refrige-,70
NA,"rator space, and the butter is put up i n",70
NA,"56-lb. boxes, whereas for the Eastern trade",70
NA,it is put up in tins or cartons. That trade,70
NA,"is at our door, so to speak. I t belongs",70
NA,"naturally to the Australian producers, and",70
NA,it would be most regrettable i f anything,70
NA,was done to hamper it. I f only 1 per,70
NA,"cent, of the people of China consumed our",70
NA,butter and our fruit we should have an,70
NA,"immense market, and should not need to",70
NA,trouble about the European trade at all.,70
Mr R GREEN ,Richmond) [4.10,70
NA,a.m.]-Th e objections which have been,70
NA,raised by myself and other honorable,70
NA,members have been to the principle,70
NA,of the amendment; not with regard,70
NA,to any section of the export,70
NA,trade. I agree with the honor-,70
NA,the able member for Maribyrnong that the,70
NA,Eastern trade naturally belongs to Aus-,70
NA,"tralia, and that, therefore, i t may be left",70
NA,out of consideration. But the amendment,70
NA,which I foreshadowed will give power to,70
NA,the board to take certain action i f the,71
NA,Eastern trade channel is being used to,71
NA,defeat the object of this bill. The clauses,71
NA,with which we are now dealing are the,71
NA,crux of the measure. I was very disap-,71
NA,pointed with the Prime Minister's ex-,71
NA,planation of these provisions. The board,71
NA,will exercise no control over production,71
NA,"intended for consumption in Australia,",71
NA,but i f producers desire to export they,71
NA,must hand their product over to it .,71
NA,The Prime Minister did not answer satis-,71
NA,factorily the supposititious case which I,71
NA,quoted of butter shipped ostensibly to,71
NA,"South Africa, but intended really for",71
NA,Great Britain. He contented himself with,71
NA,"saying that, i f necessary, an amendment",71
NA,to deal with a contingency of that nature,71
NA,could be inserted in another place. The,71
NA,"bill originated in this House, and surely",71
NA,"the collective wisdom of this chamber,",71
NA,"with its 76 members, is greater than that",71
NA,of another place which has only 36,71
NA,members.,71
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,71
NA,The honorable member is not i n order in,71
NA,referring to the Senate.,71
Mr R GREEN ,Th e Minister is to,71
NA,have f u ll control of all butter exported,71
NA,"to the European market, but not of butter",71
NA,"exported ""to South Africa, America, or",71
NA,to the East. I t is only right that the,71
NA,producers should have some say in the,71
NA,disposal of a product in which they are,71
NA,"vitally interested, and I regret that the",71
NA,Government propose to deal only with,71
NA,the control of butter for export. I f the,71
NA,"Minister is to have f u l l control, the",71
NA,pose of' the bill will be defeated.,71
NA,"The board should have control, but if",71
NA,the Government will accept an amend-,71
NA,"ment to the effect that the Minister, on",71
NA,"the recommendation of the"" board, can",71
NA,"either issue or revoke licences, I shall be",71
NA,prepared to withdraw my amendment,71
NA,providing for control by the board. The,71
NA,honorable member for Kooyong pointed,71
NA,out the danger of giving f u l l control of,71
NA,the export of butter to the Minister. I,71
NA,interviewed another member of the legal,71
NA,"profession last evening, and he agreed",71
NA,"with the honorable member for Kooyong,",71
NA,that the board would practically have no,71
NA,power i f the control were given to the,71
NA,Minister. I n such a case there would,71
NA,be no possibility of the provisions of this,71
NA,bill conflicting with those of the Customs,71
NA,Act. But i f the Minister could act only,71
NA,"on the recommendation of the board, any",71
NA,attempt by him to contravene the provi-,71
NA,sions of the bill Avould be checked by the,71
NA,operation of the Customs Act. The bill,71
NA,in its present form leaves too much to,71
NA,political control. I appeal to the Min-,71
NA,ister not to limit the control of export to,71
NA,the European market. I should not ob-,71
NA,ject to an exemption in the case of the,71
NA,"Eastern trade, because i t has its peculiari-",71
NA,"ties. ,",71
Mr GABB ,Angas) [4.25 a.m.] -Thi s,71
NA,is the fourth occasion on which I have,71
NA,endeavoured to speak on this subject. The,71
NA,Labour party cannot be accused of hav-,71
NA,ing attempted to waste the time of the,71
NA,committee in discussing clauses 14 to 21.,71
NA,We have now an illustration of hasty,71
NA,"legislation, and the blame rests absolutely",71
NA,on the Government and its supporters. I f,71
NA,the Prime Minister wishes to protect the,71
NA,fiim in Melbourne that sends canned,71
NA,"butter to the East, there is nothing in the",71
NA,bill to prevent the Minister from,71
NA,granting a licence to that firm,71
NA,to continue its operations. There is,71
NA,no provision in the bill preventr,71
NA,ing the Minister from issuing a licence to,71
NA,such a firm. But to get over the diffi-,71
NA,culty the Prime Minister has moved to,71
NA,"insert in the clause two words ""to",71
NA,"Europe."" The bill originally provided",71
NA,for the control of butter exports to the,71
NA,"whole world; but, i f the amendment is",71
NA,"carried, all but European countries will be",71
NA,exempted from its provisions. The pos-,71
NA,sibility of dummying has been mentioned.,71
NA,There is nothing in the bill to prevent a,71
NA,"purfirm from obtaining a licence to export,",71
NA,placing butter in 56-lb. boxes in the cool-,71
NA,ing chamber of a vessel calling at,71
NA,"Colombo, and consigning i t to some one",71
NA,"there who would not take one box out,",71
NA,"but simply re-consign i t to London, in",71
NA,that mariner breaking down the control,71
NA,"system that ""we are now trying to estab-",71
NA,"lish. The Prime Minister stated that, i f",71
NA,"he"" found that there was any danger in",71
NA,"the proposal, it would be remedied in an-",71
NA,"other place.' But we are here, not to pass",71
NA,slap-dash legislation to be rectified in an-,71
NA,"other place, but to give f u l l consideration",71
NA,to all matters that come before us. The,71
NA,amendment should not have been moved,71
NA,until the Prime Minister was absolutely,71
NA,certain that it would not have a damaging,71
NA,effect upon the export of butter. He also,71
NA,said that no advantage would be gained by,71
NA,giving the board added power respecting,71
NA,the control of butter in Australia. He,71
NA,omitted to say whether there were consti-,72
NA,tutional difficulties in the way of giving,72
NA,"this additional power to the board, but, i f",72
NA,"so, I should like him to explain them. I t",72
NA,is well that the dairymen of Australia,72
NA,should know the provisions of the New,72
NA,Zealand act respecting the control of the,72
NA,export of dairy produce. Section 13 of,72
NA,that act reads-,72
NA,(1.) The Board is hereby empowered to de-,72
NA,termine from time to time the extent to which,72
NA,"i t is necessary, for the effective operation of",72
NA,"this Act and the fulfilment of its purposes,",72
NA,that the board should exercise control over tbe,72
NA,export of dairy produce from New Zealand,72
NA,and may assume control of any such dairy,72
NA,produce accordingly.,72
NA,(2.) I n any such case the control of the,72
NA,board shall operate as from a time to be speci-,72
NA,fied in 'that behalf by the board by notice,72
NA,given in conformity with this act.,72
NA,(3.) Notice by the hoard of its intention to,72
NA,assume control of any dairy produce may be,72
NA,given either by service on .the owner of any,72
NA,dairy produce .or on any person having posses-,72
NA,"sion .thereof, or by publication in any news-",72
NA,"paper or newspapers, i n accordance with such",72
NA,conditions as may be prescribed. Every such,72
NA,"notice shall, subject to .the provision of this",72
NA,"act, have effect according to its tenor.",72
NA,(4.) The control to be exercised by the,72
NA,"board over any dairy produce may, as the",72
NA,"board i n any case determines, be absolute or",72
NA,limited.,72
NA,(5.) A l l dairy produce of which the board,72
NA,has assumed absolute control shall be shipped,72
NA,"as the board directs, and shall be sold and",72
NA,"disposed of .only by the board, or by direction",72
NA,of the board at such times and i n such manner,72
NA,and on such terms as the board i n its dis-,72
NA,cretion determines.,72
NA,(6.) Where the board has assumed limited,72
NA,control the extent of its control shall be defined,72
NA,"by notice as aforesaid, or .by -agreement be-",72
NA,tween the board and the owners of the dairy,72
NA,produce or other persons having authority to,72
NA,enter into an agreement with the .board with,72
NA,respect to such dairy produoe.,72
NA,(7.) Notwithstanding anything to the con-,72
NA,trary i n the foregoing provisions of this sec-,72
NA,"tion, the board shall not exercise its powers",72
NA,under this .section with respect to the sale -of,72
NA,any dairy produce i f the board is satisfied-,72
NA,"(a) That there is subsisting a contract f o r Prowse, J . H .",72
NA,'the purchase and sale of that dairy,72
NA,produce made before the commence-,72
NA,ment of this act.,72
NA,It then deals with contracts that may,72
NA,have been entered into before the opera-,72
NA,"tion <of the act. Such a provision, if in-",72
NA,"cluded in this bill, would enable the board,",72
NA,"not only to have control of export, but",72
NA,"also to take charge of all butter produced,",72
NA,and to determine what proportion should,72
NA,be exported. Unless there are constitu-,72
NA,"tional difficulties in the way, this provi-",72
NA,sion should certainly be included in the,72
NA,bill. I hope the supporters of the Go-,72

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,73

NA,able member for Bourke ( Mr Anstey)-,74
NA,"justly, I consider-t o refer to those clauses",74
NA,in order to lucidly put before the com-,74

NA,"honorable member surely does not, on",74
NA,"that account, expect me to uphold his",74

NA,NA,74
NA,understand a government that claims to,74
NA,be watchful of the interests of those who,74
NA,"will be affected by this b i l l , introducing",74

NA,will be absolutely no l i m i t to the expendi-,74

NA,so much from the point of view of the man,74
NA,who is doing well i n the industry. Some,74
NA,"men, to-day, are fortunate i n that they",74
NA,"are working on freehold land, and, not",74
NA,"having to employ outside labour, they are",74
NA,doing fairly well. I want to view the,74
NA,matter from the point of view of the share,74
NA,"dairyman, and the man who is paying big",74

NA,assistance. Those men will not later be,74
NA,unmindful of the action of the Govern-,74

NA,primary producers. The time and energies,74
NA,"of those honorable members, are now ab-",74
NA,sorbed in keeping the pact patched up.,74
NA,"The honorable gentleman who, on one",74
NA,"occasion, said "" switch on the light and",74
NA,"make them drop the loot,"" to-day sits",74
NA,cheek by jowl with the very persons whom-,74
NA,he charged with an attempt to get away,74
NA,with the loot. Last Friday I condemned,74
NA,the Government f or having brought down,74
NA,this measure without the subsidiary bill,74
NA,that is being kept somewhere i n the back-,74
NA,ground. We do not know how the money,74
NA,for financing this scheme is to be raised,74
NA,or applied.. The only inkling we have had,74
NA,was conveyed i n a remark that was made,74
NA,by the Prime Minister when moving the,74
NA,motion for the second reading of the bill.,74
NA,He then said that there is another bill,74
NA,containing the proposal that a levy of,74
NA,one-eighth of a penny a pound shall be,74
NA,imposed on all butter exported. Taking,74
NA,as a basis the exportations during the last,74
NA,"three years, the amount so raised will be",74
NA,"£50,000. Ministers declined to inform",74
NA,honorable members of what i t was pro-,74
NA,"posed to do with that £50,000, but this",74
NA,clause gives us some idea of the purposes,74
NA,for which i t is required. A greater sum,74
NA,"than £50,000 may be absorbed i n the un-'",74
NA,expenditure that the bill permits.,74
NA,Very heavy burdens are being placed upon,74
NA,the shoulders of those who are engaged,74
NA,in the dairying industry. I n Victoria,74
NA,there is a. licence fee amounting to 6d.,74
NA,a cow. There are also levies i n the,74
NA,other states. I t is safe to say that over,74
NA,the whole Commonwealth the fees and,74
NA,"levies total very nearly £100,000. There-",74
NA,"fore, i n the form of those levies alone,",74
NA,"£150,000 annually will be extracted",74
NA,from the pockets of those who are engaged,74
NA,in milk production. They are the only,74
NA,persons about whom we need concern our-,74
NA,selves. Nine-tenths of the men who to-,74
NA,day are engaged i n the dairying industry,74
NA,"would, I believe, oppose the appointment",74
NA,of these unwieldy and expensive boards.,74
NA,The electors of Gippsland already have,74
NA,reason to remember the name of Paterson,74
NA,in connexion with one curse which afflicts,74
NA,"them, but the honorable member who",74
NA,now represents them i n this House has,74
NA,given them reason to remember a second,74
NA,""" Paterson's curse,"" for by voting for",74
NA,the application of the gag to this bill he,74
NA,has prevented a f u l l and free discussion,74
NA,of its provisions. He gave notice of an,74
NA,"amendment that he intended to move,",74
NA,but by assisting the Government to apply,74
NA,the guillotine he has effectively prevented,74
NA,his amendment from being discussed.,74
NA,How will he justify himself when he faces,74
NA,his constituents ? I confess that I would,74
NA,not like to be placed i n the position of,74
NA,"honorablemembers opposite, for when",74
NA,they are asked by the electors at the next,74
NA,election what they did to encourage the,74
NA,dairying industry they will only be able,74
NA,to say that they voted to gag the bill,74
NA,"through this chamber, and thus prevent",74
NA,the committee from making i t a useful,74
NA,instrument.,74
NA,NA,74
NA,my constituents how honorable members,74
NA,opposite forced me into this position.,74
NA,NA,74
NA,.honorable member is honest with his con-,74
NA,stituents he will also tell them that he,74
NA,"deliberately voted for the gag, knowing",74
NA,that i t would prevent the discussion of,75
NA,his own amendment. Instead of stoutly,75
NA,"resisting the application of the gag, as",75
NA,"he could have done, he slavishly followed",75
NA,"the Government, who are clearly opposed",75
NA,to the amendment he has foreshadowed.,75
Mr FENTON , I f he had walked out of,75
NA,the chamber i t would not have been so,75
NA,bad.,75
NA,NA,75

NA,"some of whom, doubtless, were pre-",75
NA,sent at the banquet to the hon-,75
NA,"orable member for Wimmera last night,",75
NA,discover the kind of member they,75
NA,"have representing them, they w i l l be glad",75
NA,that they attended the banquet. A f t e r,75
NA,the Prime Minister got his gag motion,75
NA,"passed, he left the chamber feeling cer-",75
NA,tain that he could safely trust his slavish,75
NA,"followers, such as the honorable member",75
NA,"for Gippsland, to see the measure safely",75
NA,"through. The honorable member, and",75
NA,"those associated with him, are like little",75
NA,swallows sitting on the edge of the,75
NA,nest waiting for the,75
NA,to feed them. They profess to stand,75
NA,"for the interests of the primary producers,",75
NA,but they swallow whatever the Prime,75
NA,Minister offers them. I am surprised,75
NA,that they are satisfied to accept this,75
NA,scheme without any kind of explana-,75
NA,tion from the Prime Minister of how i t,75
NA,is to be financed. They do not know,75
NA,whether the primary producers -will have,75
NA,to pay the whole cost or not. I f the pro-,75
NA,posed £d. per lb. levy is intended to,75
NA,finance - the scheme the struggling pro-,75
NA,ducers will have to bear the whole burden,75
NA,of i t . I am more concerned about the,75
NA,producers than about any one else i n this,75
NA,matter. There is no harder l i f e i,75
NA,tralia than the l i f e of a dairy farmer.,75
NA,No occupation is more exacting. The,75
NA,people engaged i n i t are kept going,75
NA,"every day of the week, and they have a",75
NA,righ t to expect deeds and not mere words,75
NA,to help them in their present difficulties.,75

NA,Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr .,75
NA,"Anstey), and the speech that has been",75
NA,delivered by the honorable member f o r,75
NA,NA,75
NA,worthy of serious comment. I should,75
NA,"like to say, however, that the amendment",75
NA,appears to be a bogus one moved for. the,75
NA,express purpose of preventing me,75
Mr COLEMAN ,"O n a point of order,",75
NA,"Mr Chairman, I direct your attention",75
NA,to the statement made by the honorable,75
NA,member f o r Gippsland. He has said that,75
NA,the amendment is a bogus one. That,75

NA,NA,75
NA,"Chairman, but I should like to point out",75
NA,that I did not say i t was a bogus amend-,75

NA,bogus proposal. Is that permissible?,75
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,75
NA,"I t is very doubtful. A t this hour, the",75
NA,honorable member would be well advised,75
NA,not to use such words.,75
NA,NA,75
NA,impression is that the Acting Leader of,75
NA,the Opposition submitted his amendment,75
NA,for the express purpose of preventing,75
NA,me f r o m moving the one of which I had,75
NA,"parent bird given notice, and which is being looked",75
NA,for by thousands of dairymen i n Aus-,75
NA,tralia. What has been done to-night,75
NA,shows that honorable members opposite,75
NA,w i l l adopt any tactics to prevent me f r o m,75
NA,moving i t . I should not have minded so,75
NA,much i f the speeches mentioned had con-,75
NA,"tributed to the debate, but I am satisfied",75
NA,that they have been delivered solely for,75
NA,the purpose of preventing me from bring-,75

NA,on this question.,75
Mr BRENNAN , T h a t statement is an,75

Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [5.40.,76
NA,a.m.] -Th e concluding remarks of the,76
NA,honorable member for Hume ( Mr .,76
NA,Parker Moloney) brought to my mind a,76
NA,conversation which I had yesterday on,76
NA,the show grounds with a primary pro-,76
NA,ducer of South Gippsland.,76
NA,that the dairyman of to-day was encum-,76
NA,"bered with many troubles, including the",76
NA,encroachment of rabbits,76
NA,numerous fees which he is called upon to,76
NA,pay. Referring to this b i l l he added that,76
NA,i t appeared tohave beendesigned to i m -,76
NA,pose feesupon the dairymen without,76
NA,guaranteeing them a commensurate re-,76
NA,turn-. Clause 21 provides that the i n -,76

NA,This is unfai r discrimination. The Mel-,76

NA,The scope of the board's authority is indi-,76

NA,"which, include ""' the handling,, marketing, and",76
NA,"storage of dairy produce, the shipment of the",76
NA,dairy produce on such terms and in. such quan-,76
NA,"tities as it thinks fit, and the sale and disposal",76
NA,of dairy produce on such terms as it thinks.,76
NA,"fit."" I n order to raise revenue for tho com-",76
NA,"bine, a levy of one-eighth of a penny per pound",76
NA,"is to be collected on exported butter, and",76
NA,another of one-sixteenth of a penny per pound,76
NA,on exported' cheese. In anordinary year this,76
NA,"ought to return £40,000 or £50i000'.",76
NA,"I t is clear that, out of this substantial",76
NA,"f u n d , the board w i l l be able to provide",76
NA,"fees f o r its members, and establish a",76
NA,London agency. This w i l l be another,76
NA,"burden on the industry, i n which the con-",76
NA,ditions of work are extremely onerous.,76
NA,"On some dairy farms, even to-day, chil-",76
NA,dren of tender years are obliged to do a,76
NA,considerable amount of work. I know,76
NA,the conditions of dairy fanning. When,76
NA,I was a young lad I rose at early morn,76
NA,and milked cows.. I then walked 3 miles,76
NA,"to school, and returned i n the evening",76
NA,to again milk cows and perform other,76
NA,duties. This went on day after day. I,76
NA,"have every sympathy for young children,",76
NA,"especially little girls, who work on dairy",76
NA,farms. Now i t is proposed to place an,76
NA,"additional hardship on the dairy farmer,",76
NA,so that certain officials may live i n ease,76
NA,and comfort.,76
NA,NA,76
NA,whose duties are undefined.,76
Mr FENTON , I sard previously that,76
NA,"the bill was clumsily drafted, but i t is",76
NA,possible tbat there was design i n that.,76
NA,and the The Age article states'-,76
NA,There will be fine lucrative posts for the,76
NA,"board's members, and also for itsfortunate",76
NA,officials. The board' must report to Parliament,76
NA,"every July, when the ruling, political party will",76
NA,"be. able to exert, its influence on its operations.",76
NA,Were i t not fo r the dread of the coming,76
NA,elections wider powers would have been,76
NA,prescribed i n the hill! to enable the Go-,76
NA,vernment to tyrannize over the dairy f a r-,76
NA,"mers, much i n thes same way as Mussolini",76
NA,"is ruling I t a l y to-day, and to l i m i t the",76
NA,discussions i n this Parliament to the sup-,76
NA,portersof the Government. According to,76
NA,the press there was a meeting last night,77
NA,of the co-operative butter and cheese,77
NA,tories of Victoria. I was the first secretary,77
NA,of that organization when i t was estabside,77
NA,lished about twenty years ago. For seven posal,77
NA,years I was connected with the industry.,77
NA,"A t that meeting, Mr W . H . Day, of",77
NA,"Kyabram, stated that as far as any immehonorable",77
NA,"diate relief to the industry was concerned,",77
NA,the bill was practically useless.,77
NA,strange how hearty is the endorsement,77
NA,of the Labour party's views on this,77
NA,bill. Mr Day is one of the directors before,77
NA,"of the Kyabram Dairy Factory, and",77
NA,"he expresses himself i n such terms,",77
NA,able to realize the value that the dairy,77
NA,farmers place upon the b i l l . Y,77
NA,"Treasurer said that this measure, when",77
NA,"passed, would give immediate relief to",77
NA,the dairying industries. A t the Show,77
NA,yesterday I met .a dairyman who has a,77
NA,holding i n Southern Gippsland. H e told,77
NA,"me that there was neither comfort, solace,",77
NA,nor help i n the b i l l . From what he could,77
NA,"gather of i t , fees were to be collected from",77
NA,"the dairy producers, and no benefit would",77
NA,be received i n return.,77
Mr COLEMAN ,I call attention to the,77
NA,state of the committee.,77
NA,formed.],77
Mr FENTON ,"Thi s gentleman, a",77
NA,"prosperous dairyman, informed me that its supporters.",77
NA,tlie rabbit pest had appeared i n South,77
NA,"Gippsland, and that unless",77
NA,assistance were given by the Federal,77
NA,and State Governments many settlers and,77
NA,would be compelled to leave their remaining,77
NA,holdings. Already a number of,77
NA,men had done so because of ladk of,77
NA,"financial backing, and their holdings",77
NA,still vacant. He considered t h a t the,77
NA,"would be of no use, and that fees would committee divided.",77
NA,have to be paid t o support the board,77
NA,"here and i n London, and to meet other",77
NA,expenses. I conversed with him f o r,77
NA,"nearly an hour, and I left the Show-",77
NA,ground feeling sorrowful because of what,77
NA,I had heard. The honorable member for,77

NA,In payment of the expenses and other,77

Mr BRENNAN ,Batman) [6.9 a.m.],78
NA,- I move-,78
NA,That the bill be recommitted for the recon-,78
NA,sideration of clause 21.,78
NA,"My reason for doing this, Mr Speaker,",78
NA,is that during your absence through the,78
NA,night we have had a most dreadful time,78
NA,in this chamber. I can only express the,78
NA,hope thab the groans of anguish that rose,78
NA,have not disturbed you in your sleep. Dur-,78
NA,ing this .troublous time we have had no op-,78
NA,portunity to consider clause 21. That,78
NA,"clause does not stand alone in that respect,",78
NA,"because there were others, but i t comes",78
NA,"under special notice, because of the",78
NA,peculiar construction of the bill. The,78
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Bruce) moved for,78
NA,"the application of an instrument, known",78
NA,"as the ""guillotine,"" by which means the",78
NA,Government chopped off a number of,78
NA,clauses of the bill ending at clause 21.,78
NA,"As might be expected, in operating such",78
NA,"a dangerous weapon, no trouble was taken",78
NA,to ascertain whether there was any con-,78
NA,nexion between clause 21 and the clause,78
NA,"immediately following, which would have",78
NA,made it more appropriate to drop the,78
NA,"guillotine at clause 20, so that clauses 21",78
NA,and 22 might be considered in con-,78
NA,"junction. As a matter of fact, these two",78
NA,NOBS. clauses are wedded; yet they were merci-',78
NA,lessly divorced by the motion 'submitted,78
NA,by the Prime Minister. I t is painful for,78
NA,"me to have to tell you, Mr Speaker, that",78
NA,honorable members on the Government,78
NA,"side were nearly all asleep, but honorable",78
NA,PATES. members of the Opposition considered,78
NA,"clause 22, and in i t found references to",78
NA,the payment of expenses and other,78
NA,charges incurred by the board. Un-,78
NA,happily there was nothing before us to,78
NA,indicate how those expenses and other,78
NA,charges were to be met. We were not per-,78
NA,"mitted to consider clause 21, in which the",78
NA,"necessary provision is made, and I am now",78
NA,asking that even at this early hour in the,78
NA,day opportunity should be afforded to us,78
NA,to consider it. Clause 21 provides-,78
NA,(1.) There shall be a Dairy Produce Export,78
NA,Fund into which shall be paid out of the Con-,78
NA,"solidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby ap-",78
NA,"propriated accordingly, all moneys received by",78

NA,not asking for much when I seek merely,78
NA,the recommittal of clause 21. I should,78
NA,very much like the Government to con-,78
NA,sent to the recommittal of all bhe clauses,78
NA,which honorable members have been pre-,78
NA,vented from discussing; and in a proper,78
NA,"spirit of penitence, having the facts now",78
NA,!,78
NA,"before them, and the inadequacy of op-",78
NA,portunity exemplified to them by experi-,78
NA,"ence, Ministers might very well consent to",78
NA,"do even that. However,. I shall be satis-",78
NA,"fied for the moment with small favours,",78
NA,and i f the Government will consent to the,78
NA,recommittal of clause 21 I do not say that,78
NA,"I shall 'be for ever grateful to them, but",78
NA,I shall recognize i t as a belated act of,78
NA,very moderate and unexpected decency on,78
NA,"their part. I t is curious that, in the course",78
NA,"of the debate in committee, clause 21,",78
NA,"linked ""up with clause 22, was shown by",78
NA,the Acting Leader of the Opposition to,78
NA,"be closely interwoven with clause 23, which",78
NA,also refers to the moneys held i n the same,79
NA,"fund . I f you, Mr Speaker, had heard",79
NA,the honorable member f o r Bourke skil-,79
NA,"f u l ly expounding his argument, you",79
NA,would be the more ready to agree,79
NA,that there is reason f o r the re--,79
NA,committal of the clause. W e have,79
NA,gathered from hearsay that the dairy pro-,79
NA,duce f u n d is to be created by a leivy im,79
NA,posed on the whole of the dairying i n -,79
NA,dustry i n the interests of certain highly-,79
NA,"paid individuals, and. we regard the f u n",79
NA,and the method by which i t is to be,79
NA,"created, with the utmost suspicion. By a",79
NA,"careful calculation, the honorable member",79
NA,NA,79
NA,"proved that no less than £50,000 per",79
NA,annum will be exacted from the already,79
NA,over-taxed. persons who carry on the i n -,79
NA,dustry. No information has been given,79
NA,"to the committee, and no information is",79
NA,"proposed to be vouchsafed to the House,",79
NA,as to how the money is to be expended.,79
NA,"We know how i t is to be levied, and we",79
NA,know the merciless Government whose i n -,79
NA,"struments are to extract i t , but the Prime",79
NA,Minister has given no indication that he,79
NA,is agreeable to the recommittal of tbe,79
NA,"clause. Therefore, I hardly Enow what",79
NA,to say.,79
Mr JACKSON ,Th e honorable member,79
NA,has ten minutes left .,79
Mr BRENNAN ,Yes . B u t I am dis-,79
NA,"tressed by the long sitting, and honorable",79
NA,members on this side of the chamber are,79
NA,anxious to have a rest.,79
Mr BRUCE ,Flinders-Prim e Minis-,79
NA,ter and Minister for External Affairs),79
NA,[6.23 a.m.] -Th e measure has. been de-,79
NA,bated at great length. The second read-,79
NA,"ing was discussed f o r many hours, and",79
NA,was eventually passed by the House with-,79
NA,out any compulsion being exercised by the,79
NA,Government. Every Honorable member,79
NA,had the fullest opportunity f o r free,79
NA,speaking upon i t . The measure wa.s:,79
NA,"passed without a division, and i t was",79
NA,"considered acceptable to the House, but,",79
NA,for some reason that I cannot under-,79
NA,"stand or guess, honorable members op-",79
NA,posite adopted i n committee a cer-,79
NA,tain course having an obvious object.,79
NA,"Honorable members hope, some day, to",79
NA,"occupy the Government benches, and,",79
NA,"although i t is a vain hope, they can appre-",79
NA,ciate the fact that i t is a government's,79
NA,"duty to see that its legislation is passed,",79
NA,particularly when i t is of importance to,79
NA,the great majorit y of the people. This,79
NA,bill has been framed to benefit that,79
NA,struggling section which the dairy far-,79
NA,"mers comprise, and about which we",79
NA,have heard so many expressions of pious,79
NA,sympathy f r o m honorable members oppo-,79
NA,site. Judging by their actions they have,79
NA,not the deep sympathy w i th the dairyman,79
NA,that they would have us believe. I especi-,79
NA,- ally regret the action taken by the Opposi-,79
NA,tion i n concentrating their efforts upon,79
NA,"minor matters, at the beginning of each",79
NA,"d , clause discussed, and taking infinite pains",79
NA,to see that no important or fundamental,79
NA,issues were raised. I regret to say that,79
NA,the gentlemen opposite had a deliberate,79
NA,"object i n view. They desired, not to assist",79
NA,"in passing good legislation, but to prevent",79
NA,a useful and urgent measure from being,79
NA,placed on the statute-book . When they,79
NA,7,79
NA,found that they could not succeed i n doing,79
NA,"that, they tried to gain a position i n which",79
NA,they would be able to make political capi-,79
NA,"tal f o r an election, which will not take",79
NA,"place i n the near future, as they con-",79
NA,fidently hope. The Government cannot,79

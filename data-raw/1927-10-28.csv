NA,INSURANCE PREMIUM CHARGES.,13
Mr COLEMAN ,"O n the 8th May,",13
NA,"1924,1 asked the Prime Minister whether",13
NA,it was a fact that Australian Insurance,13
NA,Companies were charging excessive,13
NA,premiums by basing the expectation of,13
NA,"life in Australia on English tables, and",13
NA,whether the Commonwealth Government,13
NA,would introduce an insurance law to,13
NA,compel life insurance companies to adapt,13
NA,their premiums to tbe actual mortality,13
NA,statistics of Australia. To this the,13
NA,Prime Minister replied that when the,13
NA,Royal Commission on National Insurance,13
NA,"had completed its inquiries, the Govern-",13
NA,ment would consider its policy on the,13
NA,whole matter of iusurance. As the,13
NA,National Insurance Commission has now,13
NA,"completed its inquiry, and iu view of",13
NA,the complexities of legislation of this,13
NA,"character, and the many allegations of",13
NA,roguery and malpractice in relation to,13
NA,"the formation of "" wild-cat"" insurance",13
NA,"companies, will the Government cause",13
NA,legislative action to be expedited by the,13
NA,appointment of a select committee to,13
NA,conduct exhaustive * investigations into,13
NA,the whole subject of ordinary insurance?,13
NA,Is it not a fact that the Constitution,13
NA,vests in the Commonwealth Parliament,13
NA,complete power to legislate on this sub-,13
NA,ject?,13
Mr LATHAM ,Th e Bubject of life,13
NA,insurance is being investigated by the,13
NA,"Attorney-General's Department, with a",13
NA,view to the preparation of suitable legismay be obtained.,13
NA,lation. The Government does not con-,13
NA,sider it necessary that a select committee,13
NA,should be appointed to inquire into the,13
NA,matter. The Commonwealth Parlia-,13
NA,ment has power to legislate with respect,13
NA,"to insurance generally, including",13
NA,surance.,13
NA,AIR FORCE FATALITIES.,13
Mr BLAKELEY ,Ha s the Minister,13
NA,representing the Minister for Defence,13
NA,any information to impart to the House,13
NA,in connexion with the death of Cadet,13
NA,"Seach who "" crashed"" yesterday when",13
NA,making a flight from Point Cook? In,13
NA,view of the high and disquieting mortality,13
NA,in the Commonwealth Air Force during,13
NA,"the last six years, twelve valuable lives",13
NA,"having been lost, will the Minister con-",13
NA,sider the advisability of altering the,13
NA,methods of instruction and training at,13
NA,"Point Cook, and also cause an inquiry tc",13
NA,be made concerning the suitability of tlv,13
NA,types of machines used when these crashes,13
NA,have occurred?,13
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE , I regret to,13
NA,"announce that, as the result of an accident",13
NA,which occurred while carrying out air,13

NA,the ground the machine of which he was ir.,13
NA,charge became ignited and was burnt.,13
NA,"The cause of the accident is not, as yet,",13
NA,known. A court of inquiry has beci:,13
NA,convened by the Air Board to investigari,13
NA,"the occurrence, and the members of the",13
NA,court left Melbourne yesterday morning,13
NA,to visit the scene of the accident.,13
NA,The Air Accident Investigation Com-,13
NA,mittee is also conducting an inquirv,13
NA,into the fatality. Cadet Seach was,13

NA,is desires to move the adjournment of the,14

Mr NELSON ,Northern Territory).,14
NA,[11.12] - I regret tbe necessity for hav-,14
NA,the ing to move the adjournment of the,14
NA,"House on this subject, but, in view of",14
NA,exthe reply of the Minister for Home and,14
NA,in Territories ( Mr Marr) to a question,14
NA,"which I asked, I have no alternative.",14
NA,the 20th October last I asked the,14
NA,Minister for Home ancl Territories the,14
NA,"that, following question-",14
NA,I have received tlie following telegram:-,14
NA,Sleeper getters employing large number,14
NA,getting sleepers; many instances,14
NA,"on"" task work. Intense exploitation of abori-",14
NA,on government contracts where white,14
NA,labour only should be employed. A t present,14
NA,unemployment is rife. Relief work is being,14
NA,started. Numbers of workers strongly re-,14
NA,sent aborigines being exploited on govern-,14
NA,"ment work, while they have to seek relief",14
NA,work. Get Minister insist white labour get-,14
NA,ting sleepers.,14
NA,I should like to know if the Minister for,14
NA,Home aud Territories will take immediate,14
NA,action with a view tp preventing the exploita-,14
NA,tion of aboriginal labour on government con-,14
NA,tracts iu the Northern Territory?,14
NA,"""The honorable gentleman replied-",14
NA,"have no information about the matter,",14
NA,"but I shall make inquiries, and let the",14
NA,the honorable member know the result.,14
NA,"On the 26th October, the Minister hav-",15
NA,"ing received the information I sought,",15
NA,replied as follow:-,15
NA,"On the 20th October, the honorable mem-",15
NA,ber for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson),15
NA,referred to a telegram he had received stat-,15
NA,ing that sleeper getters connected with the,15
NA,railway construction work in North Aus-,15
NA,tralia were employing a large number of,15
NA,aboriginals in getting sleepers. The honorable,15
NA,member asked whether immediate action,15
NA,would be taken with a view to preventing the,15
NA,exploitation of aboriginal labour on Govern-,15
NA,ment contracts in the Northern Territory.,15
NA,From inquiries I ha ve made'it appears that in,15
NA,connexion with the railway construction work,15
NA,in North Australia contracts have been let,15
NA,"for the supply of sleepers, and tliat the con-",15
NA,tractors aro employing a certain number of-,15
NA,aboriginals to assist in securing the sleepers.,15
NA,The employment of aboriginals is controlled,15
NA,by the Aboriginals Ordinance which provides,15
NA,that no person shall employ an aboriginal un-,15
NA,less he has been granted a licence to do so,15
NA,by the Protector of Aboriginals of tlie dis-,15
NA,trict in which he is residing. The aboriginal,15
NA,is a free agent who may leave his employ-,15
NA,ment if dissatisfied. The railway construction,15
NA,camp is under the supervision of a Protector,15
NA,of Aboriginals whose duty i t is to see that,15
NA,the aborigines are not exploited. With re-,15
NA,gard to the general question of employing,15
NA,aborigines in connexion with the work of,15
NA,"supplying sleepers, i t is considered desirable",15
NA,that they sliould be given remunerative em-,15
NA,ployment so long as they are not defrauded,15
NA,or exploited. In view of the conditions under,15
NA,wliich aborigines may be employed in North,15
NA,Australia and of the fact that the railway,15
NA,construction camp is under the supervision,15
NA,"of a Protector of Aboriginals, I cannot see",15
NA,how the aborigines employed on the work of,15
NA,getting sleepers can be exploited.,15
NA,It is unfortunate that the Minister has,15
NA,been wrongly advised. In my question I,15
NA,appealed to him to stop the exploitation,15
NA,"of aboriginal labour, while white Austra-",15
NA,lians were being compelled to accept re-,15
NA,"lief work, from the administration.",15
NA,"Judge Beeby, at great expense to the tax-",15
NA,payers of Australia-and a justifiable ex-,15
NA,"pense, I may remark-recently",15
NA,the Northern Territory with a view to de-,15
NA,termining the base rate for,15
NA,classes of labour iu various,15
NA,there. After personal experience of the,15
NA,"local conditions, and after hearing the",15
NA,"evidence submitted, including",15
NA,by the representative of the Common-,15
NA,"wealth Railways Commissioner, he came",15
NA,to the conclusion that the base rate for,15
NA,"Darwin should be 2s. 6d. an hour, and, in",15
NA,"the locality to which my question referred,",15
NA,2s. S^d. an hour. It is well-known,15
NA,for many centuries the north of Australia,15
NA,3lr Nelson.,15
NA,was populated by a dense crowd of,15
NA,"aborigines, and that there are still many",15
NA,"there. Notwithstanding that fact,",15
NA,no attempt has been made by the,15
NA,aborigines themselves to develop that,15
NA,huge tract of country. Consequently we',15
NA,"took the land over f r o m them, no doubt",15
NA,"proceeding on the assumption, not that",15
NA,"the people were intended f o r the land, but",15
NA,"that the land was intended f o r the people,",15
NA,"and that, as the natives had not used i t ,",15
NA,we had a right to do so.,15
Mr JACKSON ,W e have not done much,15
NA,to help them.,15
Mr NELSON , T h a t is true; but,15
NA,"their exploitation is not justified, even",15
NA,under present conditions. I t is claimed,15
NA,that the Government is serious i n its en-,15
NA,deavour to establish a white population in,15
NA,the f a r flung spaces of Northern Aus-,15
NA,tralia. What encouragemeut is the Go-,15
NA,vernment giving to settlers to open up,15
NA,"that country, when i t asks them to",15
NA,compete with what may be accurately,15
NA,described as slave labour? As my argu-,15
NA,ment is developed I shall prove that,15
NA,"slave labour exists, and that the Minister",15
NA,has been i l l advised. He admitted the,15
NA,existence of the condition of affairs of,15
NA,which I complained i n my question. I,15
NA,shall again quote f r o m his reply-,15
NA,"From inquiries I have made, i t appears that,",15
NA,in connexion with the railway construction,15
NA,"work in North Australia, contracts have been",15
NA,"let for the supply of sleepers, and the con-",15
NA,tractors are employing a certain number of,15
NA,aborigines to assist in securing the sleepers.,15
Mr SEABROOK ,Doe s the honorable,15
NA,member object to the black man being em-,15
NA,ployed ?,15
Mr NELSON , N o ; but he should,15
NA,not be exploited. Even the honorable,15
NA,"visited member f o r Pranklin ( Mr Seabrook),",15
NA,who is known to be adverse to the labour,15
NA,different conditions ruling generally in Australia,15
NA,"industries to-day, w i l l be convinced, as I proceed,",15
NA,that the natives are being w i l f u l l y ex-,15
NA,ploited i n the north of Australia. The,15
NA,evidence Minister also said:-,15
NA,"The aboriginal is a free agent, who may",15
NA,leave his employment if dissatisfied.,15
NA,I shall prove that the native is as securely,15
NA,bound as is possible under an agreement.,15
NA,that I draw attention to section 5 of the,15
NA,"Aboriginals Ordinance of 1918-192;*>,",15
NA,which deals with the duties of the Chief,15
NA,Protector. Among the many duties i m -,16
NA,posed upon h i m are the following: -,16
NA,-,16
NA,To exercise a general supervision and care,16
NA,over all matters affecting the welfare of the,16
NA,"aboriginals, and to protect them against im-",16
NA,"morality, injustice, imposition, and fraud.",16
NA,The Minister tells us that they can start,16
NA,work when they like and finish when they,16
NA,"l i k e ; but section 52 of the ordinance, i n",16
NA,"conjunction with other sections, clearly",16
NA,shows where they actually stand. I t must,16
NA,be understood that they work under an,16
NA,agreement which is signed by the Pro-,16
NA,tector of Aborigines. Section 52 states-,16
NA,An aboriginal or half-caste who neglects or,16
NA,refuses to obey any order lawfully given under,16
NA,this ordinance shall be guilty of an offence,16
NA,against this ordinance.,16
NA,I shall show later that very strict condi-,16
NA,tions are imposed on the natives.,16
NA,further rebuttal of the Minister's state-,16
NA,"ment, let me quote section 26-",16
NA,1. Any person residing within any town,16
NA,"district,"" and desiring to employ any aboriginal",16
NA,"within any town district, shall, in addition",16
NA,"to obtaining a licence to employ aboriginals,",16
NA,enter into an agreement with the aboriginal in,16
NA,the prescribed form:,16
NA,Provided that if the Chief Protector is of the,16
NA,opinion that the employment is of a tem-,16
NA,"porary nature, and is not likely to exceed one",16
NA,"month in duration, he may dispense with the",16
NA,agreement.,16
NA,2. A copy of the agreement shall be lodged,16
NA,"with the Chief Protector, who may at any",16
NA,time investigate any complaint as to any,16
NA,alleged breach of the agreement by the em-,16
NA,ployer or the aboriginal.,16
NA,That binds the aboriginal definitely to the,16
NA,"work, and, i f he disobeys, the Chief Pro-",16
NA,tector has the necessary machinery at his,16
NA,disposal to deal with h i m . Section 27,16
NA,states-,16
NA,"Any employer or aboriginal, who is guilty",16
NA,of a breach of an agreement made in pursuance,16
NA,"of the last preceding section, shall be guilty of",16
NA,an offence against this ordinance. Penalty:,16
NA,"In the case of an employer, twenty pounds;",16
NA,"and in the case of an aboriginal, forfeiture of",16
NA,wages and cancellation or suspension of per-,16
NA,mit to enter the town district.,16
NA,"The native not only loses his wages, which",16
NA,I shall show are returned to the emmoney in the trust fund?,16
NA,"ployer, but he is even debarred the right",16
NA,"of going to the town-district, which may",16
NA,"have been his birthplace. I n other words,",16
NA,he is banished. Yet the Minister stated,16
NA,in his reply to my question that the native,16
NA,was a free agent. I say that the native,16
NA,bound hand and foot. The Minister's,16
NA,definite statement that the natives are,16
NA,"exploited condones the present system,",16
NA,which I shall show is one of wholesale,16
NA,exploitation of native labour. I t is re-,16
NA,grettable that the Minister or his advisers,16
NA,did not make themselves conversant w i t h,16
NA,the actual conditions. From the regula-,16
NA,tions under this ordinance I have given,16
NA,a f a i r l y concise idea of the alleged free-,16
NA,dom of the natives. Referring to applica-,16
NA,tions f o r licences to employ aboriginals,16
NA,"in a country district, the regulation pre-",16
NA,scribes the following f o r m of applica-,16
NA,tion :-,16
NA,To the Protector of Aboriginals at,16
NA,I (We) of occupation,16
NA,do hereby make application for a licence to,16
NA,employ male or female aboriginals.,16
NA,I (We) undertake to pay wages at the rate,16
NA,"of os. per week, and provide food, clothing, and",16
NA,tobacco for the aboriginals.,16
NA,"In I (We) employ permanently, as specified on",16
NA,"the back hereof, and food, clothing, and",16
NA,tobacco to all other aboriginals employed tem-,16
NA,"porarily, and, if requested in writing by the",16
NA,"Protector, to pay to the Protector a propor-",16
NA,"tion of such wages, to be held in trust for the",16
NA,"aboriginals, such proportion to be not less than",16
NA,10s. every month.,16
NA,I (We) undertake-,16
NA,To observe the provisions of tlie ordinance,16
NA,and regulations in regard to the em-,16
NA,ployment of aboriginals: and,16
NA,especially-,16
NA,To keep a record of any native labour,16
NA,"employed, nature of employment, and",16
NA,wages paid. Such record to be open,16
NA,for inspection by the Protector at any,16
NA,i time;,16
NA,To employ no children under 12 years,16
NA,of age;,16
NA,To set aside a portion of the lands occu-,16
NA,pied by me (us) as a native camp;,16
NA,and,16
NA,To supply reasonable shelter for the,16
NA,aboriginals I (we) employ.,16
NA,I (We) enclose herewith the fee of Ten,16
NA,shillings (10s.) for this licence.,16
NA,Signature of applicant.,16
NA,I t w i l l be noticed that the wages are,16
NA,"stated at 5s. a week, and that f r o m that",16
NA,sum 2s. is deducted and placed i n a trust,16
NA,f u n d fo r the aborigines.,16
Mr COLEMAN ,"""Wha t happens to the",16
Mr NELSON , A royal commission,16
NA,which inquired into the administration of,16
NA,"the Northern Territory investigated,",16
NA,"among other things, the trust f u n d of the",16
NA,aborigines. Evidence was produced and,16
NA,"is embodied i n the commission's' findings,",16
NA,showing that i n more than one case tho,16
NA,not Protector of Aborigines had sold t q the,16
NA,natives bicycles at from £10 to £12,17
NA,each that were not worth £1.,17
NA,The Protector of Aborigines would make,17
NA,a statement to the officer in charge of the,17
NA,trust fund that he had sold a bicycle to a,17
NA,"native, who probably had never seen it,",17
NA,"and would then, in acknowledgment of the",17
NA,"sale, make the native's sign or ""x,"" which",17
NA,"would be witnessed by the officer, and the",17
NA,sum of £10 or £12 would be withdrawn,17
NA,"from the fund, the native concerned",17
NA,knowing nothing at all about the transac-,17
NA,tion.,17
Mr ABBOTT ,I s that practice continu-,17
NA,ing?,17
Mr NELSON ,I t still can be done.,17
Mr COLEMAN ,Wha t happened to the,17
NA,royal commission's report?,17
Mr NELSON , I do not think that,17
NA,"the Government acted on that report,",17
NA,otherwise the natives would have been,17
NA,given some form of protection. I n many,17
NA,cases the native is employed at some,17
NA,distance from the centre at which the,17
NA,"trust fund is administered, and when he",17
NA,"leaves his employment and goes ""bush,""",17
NA,the money in the trust fund in his name,17
NA,is returned to his employer. The Mini-,17
NA,ster has alleged that the natives are free,17
NA,labourers. Let me draw his attention to,17
NA,"Form 5 of the regulations, which reads:-",17
NA,Form of Agreement Wit h Aboriginal or,17
NA,Name of employer,17

NA,"for him if the said aboriginal-half-caste,",17

NA,"the period agreed upon, provided that (1) if",17

NA,dismissal is fair and reasonable; (2) the ser-,17
NA,vice is not terminated by the Protector,17
NA,"notifying ihe said employer,",17
NA,the undertaking has not been carried out with,17
NA,fairness to the native.,17
NA,I t must be understood that the half-caste,17
NA,"has the ful l rights of citizenship, and can",17
NA,"exercise his franchise, yet a paltry wage",17
NA,of os. a week is prescribed for him under,17
NA,"an agreement, notwithstanding that he is",17
NA,just as capable as any other man,17
NA,of performing certain classes of work.,17
NA,I f the native or half caste leaves his em-,17
NA,ployment the protector of aborigines,17
NA,undertakes to repay to the employer,17
NA,from the trust fund the sum of 2s. a,17
NA,week. That amount is lawfully due to,17
NA,the native. Yet the Minister says that,17
NA,he is not being exploited.,17
Mr YATES ,Th e native may be forced,17
NA,"to "" go bush.""",17
Mr NELSON ,"Tha t is so, because",17
NA,the inducement is there. The agreement,17
NA,continues-,17
NA,I certify that the half-caste/aboriginal,17
NA,has had this agreement,17
NA,explained to him (or her) and is reasonably,17
NA,"aware of its provisions, and that the pre-",17
NA,scribed fee of 2s. Od. for this agreement lias,17
NA,been paid by the employer.,17
NA,Signature of Protector,17
NA,Mr G. FBANCIS -Tha t agreement is,17
NA,almost similar to the one which is work-,17

Mr NELSON ,Ther e is no compari-,17

NA,paid into the trust fund in his name is,17
NA,refunded to the employer. How a native,17
NA,clothed can be bound by an agreement and yet,17
NA,be perfectly free is beyond my compre-,17
NA,hension. I suggest that a royal commis-,17
NA,sion should be appointed to investigate,17
NA,the conditions of employment of the,17
NA,natives and the methods of exploiting,17
NA,every them. Under cover of an ordinance,17
NA,the natives arc in a condition of slavery,17
NA,hereby while white men are deprived of work.,17
NA,Under the cloak of democracy the hand,17
NA,"months, of the black birder is making itself felt.",17
NA,The aboriginal has no protection and is,17
NA,being wilfully exploited to the detriment,17
NA,of the white worker. I submit not that,17
NA,", for the aboriginal has no right to work, but",17
NA,that he should receive the f u l l award,17
NA,of his labour. No one can suggest that,17
NA,3s. a week is sufficient remuneration for,17
NA,a man using an axe. Would the Minis-,17
NA,", that ter be prepared to allow natives to work",17
NA,in his electorate at 3s. a week when the,17
NA,Signature of employer.,17
NA,award rate is £5 a week? We talk of,17
NA,upholding the dignity of the Arbitration,18
NA,"Oourt, and yet we are trying to destroy",18
NA,its awards by the exploitation of natives,18
NA,in the Northern Territory. Not only ex-,18
NA,"ploitation but slavery is rife there, and",18
NA,the sooner the Minister takes action to,18
NA,prevent it the better it will be for the,18
NA,whole community. I f the awards of the,18
NA,Arbitration Court are permitted to be,18
NA,"abrogated, there will be open revolution",18
NA,"in the territory, and when that occurs I",18
NA,shall go there to give the revolutionists,18
NA,a hand. I t is dastardly to place the white,18
NA,community of tbe territory in such a posi-,18
NA,tion.,18
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Sir Littleton,18
NA,Groom) - I ask the honorable member,18
NA,not to continue his remarks in. that,18
NA,strain.,18
Mr NELSON , I regret that in the,18
NA,heat of my desire to obtain redress for,18
NA,the natives my remarks should have been,18
NA,somewhat unparliamentary. Does the,18
NA,Minister-wish to be known as the Min-,18
NA,ister for black labour and the advocate,18
NA,of slavery.,18
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,18
NA,ber's time has expired.,18
Mr WATKINS ,A s the charges that,18
NA,"have been made are so. serious, would i t",18
NA,not be possible to move for an extension,18
NA,of time to allow the honorable member,18
NA,for Northern Territory to continue his,18
NA,remarks ?,18
Mr SPEAKER ,Standin g Order,18
NA,"119, which is applicable to this debate,",18
NA,limits the time for the discussion of the,18
NA,motion to two hours after the time fixed,18
NA,for the meeting of the House. The,18
NA,Standing Order limiting the time of the,18
NA,speeches of members has been approved,18
NA,"by the House, and is so framed as to",18
NA,prevent auy individual member from un-,18
NA,duly taking up the time of the House.,18
NA,I f an extension is required the procedure,18
NA,which has been recently followed is to,18
NA,move for the suspension of the Standing,18
NA,"Orders, and that motion can be carried",18
NA,only by an absolute majority of the whole,18
NA,of the members of the House.,18
Mr MARR ,Parkes-Ministe r for,18
NA,Home and Territories) [11.45] -Th e,18
NA,charge made by the honorable member,18
NA,for Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) is,18
NA,that the natives have been exploited. I,18
NA,have listened carefully for evidence,18
NA,"supporting the statement, but have not",18
NA,heard any. The .honorable member has,18
NA,"said, not once, but on several occasions,",18
NA,that he represents the natives of the,18
NA,"Northern Territory, and intends to safe-",18
NA,guard their interests. I resent his impu-,18
NA,tation that I am Minister for a black,18
NA,"Australia, aud throw the insult back in",18
NA,his teeth. I am as much concerned,18
NA,as lie is in safeguarding the in-,18
NA,terests of both our aboriginal and our,18
NA,white 'population. I have heard the,18
NA,honorable member say that he believes,18
NA,that our black population should receive,18
NA,"the treatment to which it is entitled, and",18
NA,I agree with him that the Australian,18
NA,aboriginal should receive the benefits to,18
NA,which he has a right. The honorable,18
NA,member has said that it is impossible to,18
NA,develop Northern Australia without the,18
NA,help of the black man.,18
Mr NELSON , I deny that.,18
Mr MARR , I have heard him say it,18
NA,"several times, and I can give quotations",18
NA,from Hansard to prove that not only he.,18
NA,but other honorable members on that side,18
NA,"of the House, have made that statement.",18
Mr NELSON ,"O n a point of order, is",18
NA,"the honorable member entitled, in the face",18
NA,"of my denial, to repeat his statement, and",18
NA,to say the proof of it is contained in,18
NA,Hansard without producing that proof?,18
Mr SPEAKER ,"I f the Minister has""",18
NA,incorrectly represented anything which,18
NA,"the honorable member has said, the honor-",18
NA,"able member will be entitled, at the con-",18
NA,"clusion of the Minister's speech, to make",18
NA,a personal explanation.,18
Mr MARR ,I f the honorable member,18
NA,denies any statement that I have attri-,18
NA,"buted to him, I accept his denial. I f I",18
NA,have misrepresented anything that he or,18
NA,any one else on the other side of tho,18
NA,"House, has said, I am prepared to with-",18
NA,draw the statement. I have said that the,18
NA,"North of Australia can only be developed,",18
NA,with the assistance of our - Australian,18
NA,"natives, and members know in their own",18
NA,hearts that that is the only way in which,18
NA,it can be done. The underlying reason,18
NA,for this motion is not a desire to pre-,18
NA,vent the exploitation of the aborigines.,18
NA,These charges of exploitation are made,18
NA,by the very people in the north who have,18
NA,been exploiting the Northern Territory,18
NA,for years. The development of the north,18
NA,has been retarded because of the action of,18
NA,men who have endeavoured to run the,18
NA,"country in tlieir own, interests, and to",19
NA,keep everything in their own grasp. I f a,19
NA,ship goes to the Northern Territory it,19
NA,cannot he unloaded unless these gentlemen,19
NA,give their consent.,19
Mr NELSON ,Th e Minister is speak-,19
NA,ing of Darwin.,19
Mr MARR ,I s not Darwin the,19
NA,capital of the Northern Territory? I have,19
NA,heard the honorable member say that,19
NA,somebody in the north is trying to break,19
NA,the awards of the Arbitration Oourt; but,19
NA,these men of whom I speak have refused,19
NA,to obey those awards.. A l l that we re-,19
NA,quire of these gentlemen in the north is,19
NA,"that they shall obey the law. Let us, on",19
NA,"both sides, stick to the law, and obey the",19
NA,awards of the court. The honorable,19
NA,member read the ordinance which lays,19
NA,down the terms under which natives may,19
NA,"be employed, but he did not cite the rates",19
NA,of wages to be paid to sleeper-getters.,19
NA,He cited the rates for rouseabouts on the,19
NA,"stations, aud for menial workers.",19
Mr MANNING ,H e deliberately tried,19
NA,to mislead the House.,19
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable,19
NA,member for Macquarie may not make a,19
NA,reflection of that kind upon any honorable,19
NA,member.,19
Mr MANNING , I said that the honor-,19
NA,able member for the Northern Territory,19
NA,bad tried deliberately to mislead the,19
NA,"House bythe statement he made, but",19
NA,"at your direction, Mr Speaker, I with-",19
NA,draw that remark.,19
Mr MARR ,Th e argument used by,19
NA,the honorable member for the Northern,19
NA,Territory was unsound. The aborigi-,19
NA,"nes, in some cases, are getting sleepers",19
NA,"themselves, without working for anybody,",19
NA,and are selling those sleepers to persons,19
NA,who have contracts. The aborigines,19
NA,have the right to do that.,19
Mr NELSON ,Bu t there are natives,19
NA,who are being employed by the sleeper,19
NA,"getters, and these natives are. being ex-",19
NA,ploited. The Minister should stick to,19
NA,the facts.,19
Mr MARR , I am sticking to the,19
NA,facts. The honorable member gave no,19
NA,instances of exploitation. The honorable,19
NA,member for Bass ( Mr Jackson) recently,19
NA,advocated the formation of a native,19
NA,State where the aborigines would be segre-,19
NA,gated. I say that i f you want to des-,19
NA,"troy our aborigines in the North, the",19
NA,best thing to do is to put them into a,19
NA,State of their own; they will then an-,19
NA,nihilate each other. I t is altogether,19
NA,wrong to say that the white sleeper con-,19
NA,tractors are exploiting the natives. Those,19
NA,who are objecting to the present pro-,19
NA,cedure have themselves the opportunity,19
NA,to cut sleepers. The Government has had,19
NA,the greatest difficulty in obtaining,19
NA,"sleepers, and i f the gentlemen whom the",19
NA,honorable member represents are pre-,19
NA,"pared to supply sleepers, we will buy",19
NA,them and use them on the railways.,19
NA,Those who make the charge of exploita-,19
NA,tion have never done anything to help,19
NA,the natives in the North; but they would,19
NA,"prevent, as they have often done in",19
NA,"the past, the natives from getting a job",19
NA,of any kind. Certain portions of the,19
NA,native labour agreement have been read.,19
NA,I t is provided in that agreement that,19
NA,no person shall employ an aboriginal,19
NA,or half-caste unless he has obtained,19
NA,a licence on the prescribed form.,19
NA,"Before granting such a licence, the Pro-",19
NA,tector of Aborigines must be satisfied,19
NA,that the applicant is a fit and proper,19
NA,person to employ aborigines. I f the,19
NA,honorable member for the Northern Ter-,19
NA,ritory can give me one case in which the,19
NA,Protector of Aborigines in any part of,19
NA,the North has not carried out the pro-,19
NA,"visions of the act, I undertake to see",19
NA,that that officer is removed from his posi-,19
NA,tion. The rate of pay wliich the honor-,19
NA,able member mentioned is that provided,19
NA,for natives working on stations and farm,19
NA,lands. I do not say tbat any particular,19
NA,government was responsible for fixing,19
NA,that rate. I t has prevailed under several,19
NA,governments. The honorable gentleman,19
NA,has admitted that these natives make ex-,19
NA,"cellent horsemen, and that the North",19
NA,can only be developed by their help.,19
Mr NELSON ,The Minister cannot,19
NA,show me that statement in Hansard.,19
Mr MARR ,"I f any person, having",19
NA,"been granted a licence to employ a native,",19
NA,who has been signed on to do rouseabout,19
NA,"work, puts him on to sleeper-getting, the",19
NA,contract is immediately void. Every em-,19
NA,ployer must make a return as to the,19
NA,labour he employs. The honorable mem-,19
NA,ber for the Northern Territory knows,19
NA,"the conditions under which natives work,",19
NA,and he also knows the conditions under,19
NA,"which, unfortunately, the white men have",19
NA,to live. None of us would like to live,19
NA,under the same conditions as those under,19
NA,which white people have to live i n the,20
NA,"North. ""We in this House should see",20
NA,that the aborigines have a fair share of,20
NA,the good things of life. I t has been,20
NA,stated that we have taken the black,20
NA,"man's country from him, and i f",20
NA,"that is so, it should be our duty to give",20
NA,"our natives the benefits of civilization,",20
NA,instead of shutting them up in a com-,20
NA,pound. We should encourage them to,20
NA,"work, aud to become useful citizens.",20
Mr THEODORE ,Surel y the Minister,20
NA,does not regard it as just to the blacks,20
NA,to employ them at Ss. a week.,20
Mr MARR ,Pro m memory I would,20
NA,say that the Ordinance covering the con-,20
NA,ditions of labour for aborigines in the,20
NA,Northern Territory is practically the,20
NA,same as that operating i n Queensland.,20
Mr THEODORE ,Th e aborigines em-,20
NA,ployed on the Queensland State stations,20
NA,"are working under an award of the Court,",20
NA,which gives them considerably more than,20
NA,3s. a week.,20
Mr MARR ,I n some places in,20
NA,Queensland the blacks may be working,20
NA,"under au award, but that aAvard is not",20
NA,equal to the awards provided for white,20
NA,men. I freely admit that the aboriginal,20
NA,"is not yet up to the white man's standard,",20
NA,and is therefore not entitled to receive,20
NA,the same remuneration.,20
Mr MCGRATH ,Ballarat) [12.0] -,20
NA,I listened very carefully to the remarks,20
NA,of both the honorable member for the,20
NA,Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) and the,20
NA,Minister ( Mr Marr). The latter failed,20
NA,utterly to answer any of the charges,20
NA,which were made. He simulated in-,20
NA,"tense indignation, and stressed the desir-",20
NA,ability of - uplifting the Australian,20
NA,aborignal. I have not been to the,20
NA,"Northern Territory, but I have had an",20
NA,opportunity to read the telegram that,20
NA,has been received by tbe honorable mem-,20
NA,ber who represents that particular portion,20
NA,of our continent. I t contains the specific,20
NA,charge that on the Katherine to Daly,20
NA,"Waters railway, the aborigines are being",20
NA,extensively exploited. This is how the,20
NA,wire reads-,20
NA,Sleeper getters employing large number,20
NA,aborigines getting sleepers; many instances on,20
NA,task work. Intense exploitation of aborigines,20
NA,on government contracts where white labour,20
NA,only should be employed. At present un-,20
NA,employment is rife. Relief work is being,20
NA,started.,20
NA,I take that to refer to relief work for,20
NA,the whites who are unemployed. The,20
NA,telegram proceeds-,20
NA,Numbers of workers strongly resent,20
NA,aborigines being exploited on government,20
NA,"work, while they have to seek relief work.",20
NA,Get Minister insist white labour getting,20
NA,sleepers.,20
NA,That charge is clear and definite; but,20
NA,it has not been answered by the Min-,20
NA,ister. Prom my reading of the ordinance,20
NA,I should say that a contractor is allowed,20
NA,"to pay as low as 5s. a week, from which",20
NA,he may deduct 2s. a week which has to be,20
NA,paid into a trust fund. The Minister,20
NA,has not supplied us with information,20
NA,which would indicate that any other,20
NA,wages are paid. We talk about the,20
NA,necessity to develop the Northern Ter-,20
NA,ritory; yet by the action of the Govern-,20
NA,ment the whites are being driven out of,20
NA,employment there. There is no desire,20
NA,on our part to deny to the blacks the,20
NA,right to live in the Territory or any,20
NA,other part of Australia; but we shall,20
NA,not civilize them by paying them 5s. a,20
NA,"week, and supplying them with a little",20
NA,tobacco. Can i t be wondered at that,20
NA,"the white residents are dissatisfied, when",20
NA,the Ministry winks its eye at the wilful,20
NA,breaking of Arbitration Court awards ?,20
Mr MARR ,Tha t is an incorrect state-,20
NA,ment to make.,20
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e Arbitration,20
NA,Court award lays it down that the wages,20
NA,of white persons shall be 2s. 8-Jd. an,20
NA,hour. The contractor has been able to,20
NA,overcome that by obtaining the permis-,20
NA,sion of the Government to employ blacks,20
NA,to do the work at a wage of 5s. a week.,20
Mr ABBOTT ,Th e wire that has been,20
NA,read by the honorable member does not,20
NA,say that the blacks are employed by the,20
NA,contractors.,20
Mr MCGRATH ,I t says distinctly,20
NA,that the employment of aborigines at a,20
NA,wage of 5s. a week by contractors for,20
NA,government railway work has received,20
NA,the sanction of the Protector of Abo-,20
NA,rigines. I f the Minister had a satisfactory,20
NA,answer he should have cleared up the,20
NA,matter long ago. He has inferred that,20
NA,"the aborigines go into the forests, cut",20
NA,"sleepers, and sell them to the govern-",20
NA,ment contractors. That is not so. Their,20
NA,"relations are embodied in the agreement,",20
NA,under which the contractor pays them 5s.,20
NA,a week for the work which they do.,20
Mr MARR ,Tha t has not been stated.,21
Mr MCGRATH ,I t has been stated,21
NA,clearly and distinctly.,21
Mr MARR ,B y whom?,21
Mr MCGRATH ,B y the honorable,21
NA,member for the Northern Territory.,21
Mr MARR ,H e has no grounds for,21
NA,his statement.,21
Mr MCGRATH ,I n accordance with,21
NA,"tlie practice of the Government, the Min-",21
NA,ister has skilfully evaded the issue by a,21
NA,simulation of anger and indignation. He,21
NA,lias carefully drawn a red herring across,21
NA,the trail. This is a most serious matter.,21
NA,A similar problem at one time confronted,21
NA,us in Queensland. The argument was ;,21
NA,used then that it was necessary to civilize,21
NA,the kanaka and make him a better indi-,21
NA,"vidual. Boiled down, it was found to be",21
NA,a case of enabling certain individuals lo,21
NA,make huge profits. The nation then de-,21
NA,termined that the kanaka would be better,21
NA,off in his own country.,21
Mr MARR ,Th e blacks arc in their,21
NA,own country.,21
Mr MCGRATH ,W e all realize that.,21
NA,Australia is open to attack through the,21
NA,"Northern Territory, and that we should",21
NA,not be able to offer a successful resistance,21
NA,if the blacks were permitted to remain,21
NA,there practically in their native state.,21
NA,The policy has been to encourage white,21
NA,people to develop that territory; but when,21
NA,the bone and sinew of the southern states,21
NA,"have accepted the invitation to go there,",21
NA,they have found themselves replaced in,21
NA,their employment by the unfortunate,21
NA,"blacks, who are paid a wage of os. a week,",21
NA,from which 2s. is deducted -,21
Mr NELSON ,I n certain circumstan-,21
NA,stances that 2s. reverts to the employer.,21
Mr MCGRATH ,I f the aboriginal be-,21
NA,"comes sick, and is unable to cut as many",21
NA,sleepers as the contractor considers he,21
NA,"should supply, that is regarded as a",21
NA,".breach of contract, and the amount which",21
NA,has been withheld from his wages goes,21
NA,into the pocket of the contractor. That,21
NA,is a. shameful practice.,21
Mr MARR ,Th e honorable member's,21
NA,stntment is entirely contrary to fact.,21
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e honorable,21
NA,member for Bass ( Mr Jackson) has en-,21
NA,dorsed the statement that frequently,21
NA,the 2s. a. week is returned to the,21
NA,employer. There is not the slightest,21
NA,"doubt, also, that that assertion was",21
NA,proved to be correct by the royal,21
NA,commission which investigated the,21
NA,matter. The contractor who is unscrupu-,21
NA,lous enough to employ black labour in,21
NA,"preference to white, will embrace every",21
NA,opportunity to compel the aboriginal to,21
NA,"break his agreement, and thus swell his",21
NA,own banking account. I cannot under-,21
NA,stand the Ministry sanctioning it. I t is,21
NA,not in the best interests of either the,21
NA,blacks or the unfortunate whites who,21
NA,have migrated to the Northern Territory.,21
NA,"Only a plucky man, who has a big heart",21
NA,"and a strong physique, will go to those",21
NA,"wild places, and endeavour to wring from",21
NA,them a living for his wife and children.,21
NA,Whatever honorable members opposite,21
NA,"may decide to do, the charges that have",21
NA,been levelled at the Government by tbe,21
NA,honorable member for the Northern Ter-,21
NA,"ritory will ring throughout Australia,",21
NA,aud at no distant date the exploitation of,21
NA,"the unfortunate aboriginal may cease,",21
NA,and a better day dawn for him.,21
Mr JACKSON ,Bass) [12.10] - I ap-,21
NA,preciate the difficulty in which honorable,21
NA,members of the Opposition find them-,21
NA,selves.,21
Mr YATES ,Th e honorable member's,21
NA,own position is a fairly difficult one.,21
Mr JACKSON ,No t at all. Honor-,21
NA,able members opposite are between two,21
NA,fires. On the humanitarian side they are,21
NA,seized of the necessity to do something to,21
NA,advance the welfare of the aborigines;,21
NA,"whilst on the other side, pressure is being",21
NA,put upon them by the unions in the Nor-,21
NA,thern Territory to prevent the aboriginal,21
NA,from earning a living. I wish that 1,21
NA,could be clear in my mind that they in-,21
NA,tend to see that the black man shall be,21
NA,given a fair deal. This debate has fur-,21
NA,nished another reason for embarking,21
NA,upon the inquiry which I suggested a week,21
NA,or two ago. I congratulate the honorable,21
NA,member for the Northern Territory on the,21
NA,step that he has taken in having brought,21
NA,"this matter before the House, because I",21
NA,am not convinced that there are not,21
NA,serious grounds for complaint. The time,21
NA,has arrived to have clearly defined the em-,21
NA,ployment of white and black labour in the,21
NA,Northern Territory. The honorable mem-,21
NA,ber alleged that the aborigines had done,21
NA,nothing to develop the lands which they,21
NA,had occupied for so many years. We have,21
NA,been in possession of those lands for nearly,21
NA,"150 years, yet what have we in spite of",21
NA,our superior civilization done towards,21
NA,educating them along those lines?,22
NA,"sert that more has been done to "" syphisleeper",22
NA,"lize"" than to civilize them.",22
Dr MALONEY , And medicine,22
NA,cure them has been denied them.,22
Mr JACKSON ,Th e Department of ing;,22
NA,Home and Territories on one occasion de-,22
NA,manded payment from the officials of the,22
NA,telegraph station for the renewal of the,22
NA,"medicine chest, the contents of which were",22
NA,invariably given away to drovers ern,22
NA,and natives in the district. The tralia,22
NA,honorable member for Ballarat has,22
NA,made certain charges against this provided,22
NA,"Government. I ask him, what did",22
NA,the Fisher Government do when wander,22
NA,it took over the control of the Northern so often do.,22
NA,Territory? I t was not until 1918 that,22
NA,an ordinance governing the conditions,22
NA,labour was brought in. A great deal,22
NA,been said with regard to unemployment. per week ?,22
NA,I cannot admit that that is the fault of,22
NA,this Government. Much of it has been,22
NA,brought about by the conditions that have,22
NA,been forced upon employers by commitpointed without delay.,22
NA,tees representative of the white workers.,22
NA,There is no need to traverse the history,22
NA,Vestey's Meat Works or to enlarge upon,22
NA,the outbursts of industrial disaffecthis motion.,22
NA,tion that have been witnessed there,22
NA,from time to time. The only solution of,22
NA,the white labour problem in the north,22
NA,will be the construction of the northto,22
NA,south line. I do not care whether i t,22
NA,straight through from Alice Springs to,22
NA,Darwin or across from Camooweal.,22
Mr FENTON ,Thi s Parliament must,22
NA,not depart from the obligation imposed,22
NA,upon i t by the honorable agreement,22
NA,into which it entered.,22
Mr JACKSON , I do not wish to be,22
NA,misunderstood. I believe in giving effect,22
NA,to that agreement. I want to see the,22
NA,continued from Alice Springs. But I,22
NA,"repeat, what I have said previously, that",22
NA,one railway line is not sufficient to develop,22
NA,half a million square miles of territory.,22
NA,I strongly support the proposed extension,22
NA,of the line across the Barkly Tableland,22
NA,to link up with the Queensland railway,22
NA,"system. I understand that the magiven,",22
NA,jority of honorable members of iu,22
NA,this House are in favour of that proposal.,22
NA,The construction of either or both of,22
NA,those lines would solve the problem of,22
NA,white labour i n the Northern Territory.,22
NA,The honorable member for the Northern,22
NA,Territory ( Mr Nelson) referred,22
NA,I aswages paid to aborigines engaged in,22
NA,getting; but i t must be remem-,22
NA,bered that native labour is not as efficient,22
NA,to as white labour. The aborigines,22
NA,are provided with food and some cloth-,22
NA,but I admit that its cost is not great.,22
Mr NELSON ,Th e honorable member,22
NA,knows something of the clothing provided.,22
Mr JACKSON ,"Yes , i t is very",22
NA,scanty. As the aborigines in the North-,22
NA,Territory as in other parts of Aus-,22
NA,"have a right to work, i t is the duty",22
NA,of the Government to see that they are,22
NA,with suitable employment rather,22
NA,than that 'they should be allowed to,22
NA,about from place to place as they,22
Mr NELSON ,Doe s the honorable,22
NA,of member think that they should be em-,22
NA,has ployed on Government contracts at 3s.,22
Mr JACKSON , I do not. That is,22
NA,one reason why I hope the select com-,22
NA,mittee which I have suggested will be ap-,22
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Sir Littleton,22
NA,of Groom) -Th e honorable member will not,22
NA,be in order in discussing that subject on,22
Mr JACKSON , I thought I should,22
NA,be in order in referring to the suggested,22
NA,committee which I think would be able,22
NA,submit valuable recommendations to,22
NA,goes' the Government. The aborigines of the,22
NA,"Northern Territory are of fine stature,",22
NA,but with the mind of an infant. I t is our,22
NA,duty to educate them. They should also,22
NA,be provided with employment at wages,22
NA,commensurate with the services they,22
NA,render. Hundreds of natives along the,22
NA,"overland telegraph line do no work, and",22
NA,are being fed by the Government. These,22
NA,line men could be employed on road con-,22
NA,"struction, afforestation and water con-",22
NA,"servation, which would be.of benefit to",22
NA,the natives and of advantage to the Com-,22
NA,monwealth. The honorable member for,22
NA,the Northern Territory is justified in,22
NA,"bringing the matter before the House, and",22
NA,in view of the information which has been,22
NA,a. thorough inquiry should be made,22
NA,order to ascertain definitely where the,22
NA,trouble lies. I am sure honorable mem-,22
NA,.bers on this side of the Chamber will sup-,22
NA,port the Opposition in doing a fair thing,22
NA,not only to the aborigines in the Northern,22
NA,Territory; but also to the white persons,22
NA,to .the who are now settled there.,22
Mr LAZZARINI ,Werriwa) [12.17].,23
NA,-Th e honorable member for the,23
NA,Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has,23
NA,rendered a great service to the,23
NA,Commonwealth in bringing this mat-,23
NA,ter under the notice of the House.,23
NA,I was impressed with the attitude,23
NA,"of the Minister ( Mr Marr), who,",23
NA,in replying to the charges made by,23
NA,the honorable member for the Northern,23
NA,"Territory, delivered one of the most vig-",23
NA,orous speeches he has ever made in this,23
NA,"Chamber. I t appeared to me, however,",23
NA,that he was endeavouring to evade the,23
NA,"main issue, and when his bluff was called",23
NA,"by two very pertinent interjections, he",23
NA,wilted very badly. He did not attempt to,23
NA,reply to many of the charges made by,23
NA,the honorable member for the Northern,23
NA,Territory. The question we have to an-,23
NA,swer is whether the natives of the,23
NA,Northern Territory are being exploited,23
NA,in the manner suggested. I t has been,23
NA,said that those engaged in sleeper getting,23
NA,"are paid 5sa week, 2s. of which",23
NA,is paid into a trust fund until a contract,23
NA,is completed. Even i f the work,23
NA,is carried out to the satisfac-,23
NA,tion of the contractor,23
NA,convinced that tlie poor unfortunate abo-,23
NA,rigines are not paid the 2s. of their own,23
NA,money which has been retained. The,23
NA,honorable member for Bass ( Mr Jack-,23
NA,son) said that the aborigines are supplied,23
NA,with food; but be will admit that,23
NA,the quantity is sufficient only to,23
NA,"keep them alive, and the quality is",23
NA,inferior. I understand they are also,23
NA,supplied with a few rags to cover their,23
NA,nakedness. Is not the payment of 3s.,23
NA,a week exploitation?,23
Mr NELSON ,Th e Minister says that,23
NA,it is not.,23
Mr MARR , I said that the honorable,23
NA,"membei"" for the Northern Territory did",23
NA,not say that the payment of that amount,23
NA,was attributable tp the action of the,23
NA,sleeper-getters.,23
Mr LAZZARINI , I do not know,23
NA,what opinion the Minister holds on this,23
NA,matter; but he is now faced with the,23
NA,"fact that these poor unfortunate human,",23
NA,beings are being paid only 3s. a week.,23
NA,The position is infinitely worse when we,23
NA,realize that the sleepers are being used,23
NA,on government railway contracts. The,23
NA,honorable member for Bass referred to,23
NA,the construction of the North-South,23
NA,railway; but I should like to know i f,23
NA,the Government expects that work to be,23
NA,done by aborigines who are to be paid,23
NA,only 3s. a week? The honorable member,23
NA,also referred to the natives as men of,23
NA,fine stature but with a child's mind.,23
NA,That is the material the exploiters are,23
NA,always seeking.,23
Mr JACKSON ,Th e honorable member,23
NA,", should not blame me.",23
Mr LAZZARINI , I do not. I do,23
NA,not accuse the honorable member of,23
NA,favouring such a system. The Minister,23
NA,said that natives are engaged on menial,23
NA,work; but I can conceive of no occupation,23
NA,in the Northern Territory or anywhere,23
NA,else tbat is not worth more than 3s. a,23
NA,week. The Minister also stated that the,23
NA,Northern Territory can be developed,23
NA,only with the assistance of native labour.,23
NA,That is a point that I am not prepared,23
NA,to affirm or dispute; but i f colored labour,23
NA,"is essential to its development, the",23
NA,natives should be permitted to work,23
NA,I am under the conditions enjoyed by white,23
NA,men.,23
Mr JACKSON ,The y would not be,23
NA,employed under such conditions.,23
Mr LAZZARINI ,Perhap s not. I n -,23
NA,efficient or slow workers are provided for,23
NA,"in our Arbitration Court awards, .and",23
NA,the Government should see that these men,23
NA,are paid a reasonable rate even i f their,23
NA,work is not up to standard of that of,23
NA,the white man. Kanakas were brought,23
NA,"to Queensland in droves, and native",23
NA,labour was also exploited.,23
Mr JACKSON ,Th e honorable member,23
NA,must admit that the industry in which,23
NA,the kanakas were engaged benefited.,23
Mr LAZZARINI ,Tha t is another,23
NA,"matter. This is a national work, as the",23
NA,security of Australia depends largely,23
NA,upon the extent to which the Northern,23
NA,Territory is settled. I t is the duty of,23
NA,the Commonwealth Government to,23
NA,"develop the Northern Territory, but i t",23
NA,should not depend upon the assistance of,23
NA,"aborigines who are paid only 3s. a week,",23
NA,The Minister referred to the industrial,23
NA,conditions at Darwin and to the demands,23
NA,made by the workers' there. We have,23
NA,heard a good deal of those who are doing,24
NA,the pioneering work; but to me that is,24
NA,all humbug. Those who bave invested,24
NA,"money in the Northern Territory, and",24
NA,"who are employing labour, bave done so",24
NA,"with the sole intention of making profits,",24
NA,and not with the idea of developing the,24
NA,country. I f the white workers there are,24
NA,sufficiently well organized to demand,24
NA,wages and conditions which the employers,24
NA,"think unreasonable, the employers should",24
NA,get out of the Territory. Some,24
NA,pastoralists in the Northern Territory,24
NA,who are holding huge tracts of country,24
NA,say that they cannot carry on profitably,24
NA,because of the ruling labour conditions.,24
NA,"That is a stupid argument, because they",24
NA,are not forced to remain. I f they cannot,24
NA,"pay their workmen decent wages, the",24
NA,country is better without them.,24
Mr FENTON ,Vestey s went to South,24
NA,Africa in order to obtain cheap labour.,24
Mr LAZZARINI ,An d they would,24
NA,return to Northern Australia to-morrow,24
NA,if they could be sure of a similar supply,24
NA,of cheap labour there.,24
Mr JACKSON ,O n one station in,24
NA,Queensland there is one white man to,24
NA,twenty aborigines.,24
Mr LAZZARINI , I was astonished,24
NA,to hear the Minister say that while it was,24
NA,a fair thing that the aborigines should,24
NA,"enjoy some of the good things of life, they",24
NA,were given the opportunity to do so on a,24
NA,wage of 3s. a week. The Minister's atti-,24
NA,tude indicated that he approved of the,24
NA,payment of that wage.,24
Mr MARR ,I t did nothing of the kind.,24
Mr LAZZARINI ,I f the Minister,24
NA,does not approve of the prevailing condi-,24
NA,"tions, why did he attempt so vigorously",24
NA,to justify them ?,24
Mr MARR ,Tha t statement is quite,24
NA,wrong.,24
Mr LAZZARINI , I trust that one re-,24
NA,sult of this debate will be that the people,24
NA,"of Australia will indicate, in an unmis-",24
NA,"takable way, their desire to have these",24
NA,objectionable conditions remedied. Some-,24
NA,thing has been said about the attitude of,24
NA,former Commonwealth Labour Go-,24
NA,"vernments on this matter, but I",24
NA,point out that . until the Northern,24
NA,Territory had direct representation,24
NA,"in this Parliament, governments, as",24
NA,"well as honorable members generally, had",24
NA,very little information about the condi-,24
NA,tions that existed there. Since the,24
NA,honorable member for the Northern Ter-,24
NA,ritory has been a member of this,24
NA,Parliament he has been able on many,24
NA,occasions to inform us of evils there that,24
NA,"required remedies, and I trust that he will",24
NA,continue to bring under our notice direct,24
NA,information of conditions which should,24
NA,not be allowed to prevail. Honorable,24
NA,members should consider this matter in,24
NA,the spirit in which it has been introduced.,24
NA,I trust that we shall do all in our power,24
NA,to treat our aborigines generously as,24
NA,"well as justly. We should do so, for the",24
NA,good name of our country.,24
Mr YATES ,Adelaide) [12.33] -Th e,24
NA,Minister for Home and Territories alto-,24
NA,gether failed to make an effective reply,24
NA,to the charges of the honorable member,24
NA,for the Northern Territory. He started,24
NA,"to speak at an express rate, and I do not",24
NA,know for how long he would have main-,24
NA,tained the speed i f the honorable member,24
NA,for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) had not,24
NA,made an injudicious remark. A fact,24
NA,that emerges quite clearly from this dis-,24
NA,cussion is that government by ordinance,24
NA,is quite unsatisfactory. The illustration,24
NA,of the bicycle transaction which the,24
NA,honorable member for the Northern Ter-,24
NA,ritory gave is proof positive on that point.,24
NA,The more closely settled our outback,24
NA,areas become the more clearly are we,24
NA,able to observe the failure of control by,24
NA,ordinance. I was in New Guinea re-,24
NA,"cently, and had brought home to me there",24
NA,how unsatisfactory some of our existin/j,24
NA,administrative methods are - I had the,24
NA,opportunity of perusing the report of a,24
NA,conference that was held there some time,24
NA,ago. Although I understood that the,24
NA,Minister for Home and Territories would,24
NA,table a copy of the report as soon as i t,24
NA,"was available, I took the precaution to",24
NA,make a few extracts from it. I propose,24
NA,"to quote these, for they concern cases",24
NA,which may well be compared with those,24
NA,which the honorable member for the,24
NA,"Northern Territory has mentioned to-day,",24
NA,though his deal with Australian aborigi-,24
NA,"nes, while mine concern the natives of",24
NA,New Guinea. The first extract reads,25
NA,follows:-,25
NA,Tlie absenco'of clothes lias been found,25
NA,times to lead to pneumonia among natives,25
NA,charging' vessels or doing otlier heavy work,25
NA,The most dangerous factor in this disease,25
NA,"unequal overheating of the body, and those",25
NA,who have seen natives perspiring proone,25
NA,"fusely at their work, and stand shivering",25
NA,"the evening breeze, or sleeping on the bare",25
NA,"deck of Burns, Philp's vessels, will readily",25
NA,appreciate the reason for the deaths that occur,25
NA,after each voyage.,25
NA,Honorable members have never been told,25
NA,about these deaths that occur after every,25
NA,voyage which a Bums-Philp boat makes,25
NA,"in New Guinea waters, nor do they ever",25
NA,see official reports of the nature that,25
NA,have read.,25
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,Fro m what remember,25
NA,port did the honorable member quote?,25
Mr YATES , F r o m the annual,25
NA,port of the New Guinea Department,25
NA,"Public Health, 1925-26. The responsithere",25
NA,bility of remedying grave troubles such,25
NA,as these rests upon us. The honorable,25
NA,member f or the Northern Territory made,25
NA,extensive references to the wages and,25
NA,working conditions of our aborigines ancl,25
NA,said that the 2s. a week which was placed,25
NA,in a f u n d to be used f or their benefit,25
NA,often estreated. I can quite understand,25
NA,that unscrupulous employers would not,25
NA,hesitate to use every means i n their,25
NA,to regain possession of this money. They which the,25
NA,could easily make some trumpery charge,25
NA,against the aborigine concerned and so,25
NA,prevent hi m f r o m receiving the money employ aborigines.,25
NA,"and I have no doubt, i n such a case,",25
NA,where i t would go. Something of the,25
NA,kind of thing occurs i n New Guinea,25
NA,the following extract f r o m the report,25
NA,f r o m which I have already quoted w i,25
NA,show:-,25
NA,I t is common property in Rabaul that when,25
NA,"labourers are paid off, illegal means of re-",25
NA,cruiting are employed to induce them to,25
NA,sign. The boy is taken to a room without,25
NA,witnesses and the third degree is put upon let,25
NA,him day after day to make new paper. Even,25
NA,aftor a boy has been at work many years,25
NA,these practices are more often than not suc-,25
NA,cessful. Other boys are paid off and delib-,25
NA,erately induced to spend all their money,25
NA,fore the departure of the boat conveying,25
NA,"home, with the object of forcing them to",25
NA,"new paper. Another method employed, par-",25
NA,ticularly during the military and German,25
NA,"ministration, was to employ women as",25
NA,"centive to recruiting. A man dying, his",25
NA,"widow, is more oiten than not offered",25
NA,as as un inducement to his recruiting; in fact.,25
NA,I personally know that women recruiters carry,25
NA,unmarried girls about with them when re-,25
NA,"somecruiting, ""and the boys were offered a night",25
NA,diswith these girls in lieu of hand money. These,25
NA,unions with widows of deceased labourers re-,25
NA,is sulted in those marriages of convenience,25
NA,which I now trust have been suppressed. In,25
NA,case of such a marriage a woman on re-,25
NA,in turn to her village iu Namatanai was stoned,25
NA,to death as she had committed tribal incest.,25
NA,"I t may be said of the New Guinea natives,",25
NA,just as i t has been said of the Australian,25
NA,"aborigines, that the terms of indenture",25
NA,are all set out in the Ordinances; but,25
NA,that does not by any means ensure that,25
NA,abuses w i l l not occur. I n all the circum-,25
NA,I stances i t is not creditable to the Minister,25
NA,for Home and Terriories that he should,25
NA,try to ride the high horse. The honorable,25
NA,f o r Bass ( Mr Jackson) who has,25
NA,"been i n Central Australia several times,",25
NA,and knows very well the conditions under,25
NA,"rewhich the blacks there have to live,",25
NA,of showed quite clearly that he thought,25
NA,was ground f o r the charges which,25
NA,"have been made this morning. He, unlike",25
NA,"the Minister, does not regard the accu-",25
NA,sations as a mere exhibition of i l l temper.,25
NA,The Minister told us that i t is the custom,25
NA,for aborigines to go out sleeper-getting,25
NA,on their own account and afterwards sell,25
NA,was the sleepers to the contractors; but,25
NA,i t must be apparent to honorable,25
NA,members that sleeper-getting requires,25
NA,power some equipment. The telegram upon,25
NA,honorable member for,25
NA,the . Northern Territory has based his,25
NA,charges came f r o m sleeper-getters who,25
NA,The Minister f o r,25
NA,"Works and Railways shakes his head, but",25
NA,same I am sure that there was some good,25
NA,as reason f o r sending the telegram. When,25
NA,the Minister f o r Home and Territories,25
NA,l l replied to a question on this matter this,25
NA,morning he said:-,25
NA,From inquiries I have made i t appears that,25
NA,rein connexion with the railway construction,25
NA,work in North Australia contracts have been,25
NA,"for the supply of sleepers, and that the con-",25
NA,tractors are employing a certain number of,25
NA,aborigines to assist in securing the sleepers.,25
NA,"beHe had ascertained that after inquiry,",25
NA,them but he has not told us how many .con-,25
NA,make tractors are working. He ought to know,25
NA,adhow many licences have been issued.,25
NA,an inThat was information he should have,25
NA,given i n order to refute the charge that,25
NA,to a boy aborigines are being exploited.,25
Mr FOSTER ,Th e House ought to,26
NA,know what the aborigines are really paid.,26
Mr YATES ,Th e honorable member,26
NA,is quite right. Instead of telling us,26
NA,liis inquiries showed that contracts,26
NA,been let and that the contractors are,26
NA,"ploying aborigines, the Minister should",26
NA,have given the details sought by,26
NA,the honorable member for the Norinformation,26
NA,thern Territory. He has told us,26
NA,that natives go out into the bush,26
NA,on their own to bring in the sleepers,26
NA,"and sell them, and that some aborigines",26
NA,are being employed by sleeper-getters. I the new railway.,26
NA,should like to know under what ordinance,26
NA,"they are employed, the wages they receive",26
NA,and the hours they work. Under one,26
NA,ordinance the employers of aborigines explanation.,26
NA,must set aside a portion of ground as a,26
NA,housing area for them and provide,26
NA,shelters for them. I should like to know,26
NA,what arrangements are made by,26
NA,sleeper contractors to house their abori-,26
NA,ginal employees.,26
Mr MANNING ,D o I understand,26
NA,from the telegram which has been read,26
NA,that the sleeper contracts referred to,26
NA,in connection with the new railway in tory.,26
NA,course of construction?,26
Mr YATES ,Th e new railway is,26
NA,from Katherine jo Daly Waters. I f,26
NA,blame is to be attached to anyone for the,26
NA,time of the House being occupied to-day,26
NA,the Minister must accept i t because of the,26
NA,lack of information in his reply to the,26
NA,question submitted by the honorable mem-,26
NA,ber for the Northern Territory.,26
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,26
NA,ber's time has expired.,26
Mr MARR , J wish to make a per-,26
NA,sonal explanation. The honorable mem-,26
NA,ber for Adelaide ( Mr Yates) has just,26
NA,asserted that I said the natives went into,26
NA,the bush to collect sleepers on their own,26
NA,account.,26
Mr YATES ,Th e Minister made the,26
NA,statement.,26
Mr MARR ,Wha t I meant to say was,26
NA,that i t is possible that natives go out and,26
NA,collect sleepers to sell to some of the,26
NA,sleeper-getters. This morning I had not,26
NA,had sufficient intimation that this motion,26
NA,"was to be moved, but I did my best to",26
NA,secure whatever material was available in,26
NA,that the Home and Territories Department.,26
NA,had The reply I furnished to the honorable,26
NA,emmember for the Northern Territory was,26
NA,put together from information obtained,26
NA,"from North Australia, but from further",26
NA,which has come to hand I,26
NA,am now in a position to state that there,26
NA,are no sleeper-getters in the Northern,26
NA,"Territory, and that steel, and not wooden,",26
NA,sleepers are used in the construction of,26
NA,"Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! the honor-",26
NA,able member is going beyond a personal,26
Mr MARR , I am anxious to correct,26
NA,my statement that natives go out on their,26
NA,the own account to get sleepers.,26
Mr NELSON ,Northern Territory),26
NA,[12.49] -Fro m personal experience I,26
NA,can state that the Minister is absolutely,26
NA,incorrect in saying that no wooden,26
NA,are sleepers are used in the Northern Terri-,26
Mr MARR , I was referring to the new,26
NA,construction.,26
Mr NELSON ,Woode n sleepers are,26
NA,"still being cut and used for replacements,",26
NA,and whether they are used on the new,26
NA,section or on the existing line does not,26
NA,matter. I defy the Minister for Home,26
NA,and Territories or Minister for Works,26
NA,and Railways to deny that there are no,26
NA,contracts in existence for the getting of,26
NA,sleepers for railway requirements in the,26
NA,Northern Territory. To say that wooden,26
NA,sleepers are not being used for new con-,26
NA,struction is mere camouflage. Already,26
NA,the Minister in his reply to me has ad-,26
NA,mitted that contracts have been let for,26
NA,the supply of these sleepers and that,26
NA,natives are working for the contractors.,26
NA,Why cannot he frarikly admit what he,26
NA,"knows perfectly well, that, although",26
NA,"wooden sleepers are, perhaps, not re-",26
NA,quired for the building of the new sec-,26
NA,"tion between Daly Waters and Katherine,",26

Mr HILL ,"O n Thursday, 27th Octo-",27
NA,"ber, the honorable member for Reid",27
NA,( Mr Coleman) asked me the following,28
NA,questions:-,28
NA,"Is i t a fact, that owing to the failure of the",28
NA,central administration of the War Service,28
NA,Homes Commission to authorize the employ-,28
NA,"ment of additional staff, the employees of the",28
NA,New South Wales branch are being over-,28
NA,"worked? I n addition to much overtime, are",28
NA,the employees compelled to take work home,28
NA,"to enable them to overtake arrears, for which",28
NA,they receive no remuneration ? Has the Com-,28
NA,monwealth Medical Officer for New South,28
NA,South Wales made a report to the Chief Medi-,28
NA,cal Officer of the Commonwealth on these,28
NA,"speeding-up methods, directing attention to",28
NA,several break-downs which are attributed to,28
NA,this cause? W i l l the Minister for Works and,28
NA,Railways ask the Public Service Board to con-,28
NA,duct an inquiry into the working conditions of,28
NA,this department?,28
NA,I now have pleasure i n f u r n i s h i n g the,28
NA,f o l l o w i n g replies to the questions:-,28
NA,1. No. There was a very large increase of,28
NA,"applications in May, June, July, August, and",28
NA,"September, and requests from applicants for",28
NA,additional advances following the 1927 amend-,28
NA,ment of the War Service Homes Aet.,28
NA,"was only a temporary phase, and after in-",28
NA,"quiries, i t was decided that extra staff was not",28
NA,necessary. The applications are being,28
NA,"with in the order of priority, and no officer is",28
NA,required to complete more than a fair day's,28
NA,"work, the hours of duty being from 9 a.m. to",28
NA,"4.45 p.m., with one hour for lunch, and 9 a.m.",28
NA,until noon on Saturdays.,28
NA,Having regard to the hours of duty in busi-,28
NA,"ness houses and industries generally, i t is not",28
NA,considered that those in the commission are,28
NA,unduly long.,28
NA,2. During the year 49 officers worked an,28
NA,average of 44 hours overtime each-a n average,28
NA,per officer of 44 hours per month. Officers re-,28
NA,ceiving over £450 per annum are not entitled,28
NA,to overtime. No officer has been asked to take,28
NA,work home. I t has been found that several,28
NA,"officers have acted in this way, the reason be-",28
NA,ing that the matters so dealt with were some-,28
NA,"what difficult, and they preferred to handle",28
NA,them in the quietude of their homes. This has,28
NA,only happened in the case of several senior,28
NA,officers.,28
NA,3. Not that I am aware of. I should also,28
NA,say that speeding-up methods have not been,28
NA,"adopted in the New South Wales branch, and",28
NA,this may be gauged from the fact that the,28
NA,administrative costs of the New South Wales,28
NA,branch are greater in proportion than those of,28
NA,the Queensland branch. Five officers,28
NA,been examined by the Commonwealth Medical,28
NA,Officer at the request of the commission. I n,28
NA,"one case the illness was neurasthenia, and be-",28
NA,fore its onset the officer stated that he had not,28
NA,properly recovered from influenza and was ex-,28
NA,cessively worried over certain private matters.,28
NA,In two cases the illness was debility; i n an-,28
NA,"other furunculosis, and in the other hyper-",28
NA,priesis and nerve fatigue. I t is not,28
NA,sidered that official duties were responsible,28
NA,for these illnesses.,28
NA,4. No. The officers employed are granted,28
NA,eighteen days' recreation leave each year and,28
NA,only in-seven cases will 1927 leave not be taken,28
NA,this year. The leave in these latter instances,28
NA,should be disposed of early in 1928.,28

Mr MARR ,Favorabl e consideration,29

NA,which this may be done.,29
NA,Yesterday the honorable member for,29
NA,Hunter ( Mr Charlton) asked me the,29
NA,following questions:-,29
NA,1. What is the reason for charging motor,29
NA,registration and licence fees in the Federal,29
NA,Territory similar to those prevailing in the,29
NA,"States, when there is sueh a vast difference",29
NA,between the area of the Territory as compared,29
NA,with that of any State?,29
NA,2. W i l l he review these rates with a view to,29
NA,making substantial reductions?,29
NA,I have now received the following in-,29
NA,formation from the commission:-,29
NA,1 and 2. The charges in respect to motor,29
NA,registration in the Federal Capital Territory,29
NA,are ou a similar basis to those in force in,29
NA,"New South Wales, but are £1 per vehicle less.",29
NA,"I t is uot considered that "" area"" affords a",29
NA,satisfactory basis of comparison. I t is con-,29
NA,sidered that motorists in the Federal Capital,29
NA,Territory enjoy facilities equal to those in the,29
NA,"various States, and that they, therefore, suffer",29
NA,no hardship which would justify making any,29
NA,"further reduction in fees, particularly as the",29
NA,number of motorists in the Territory is con-,29
NA,siderably less than in any State. The cost,29
NA,of providing services in the Federal Capital,29
NA,"Territory is at least as great as in the States,",29
NA,and the roads more than favorably compare,29
NA,with those in many parts of Australia where,29
NA,motorists are required to pay liigher fees.,29
NA,T h e lionorable member f o r H u,30
NA,( Mr C h a r l t o n ) also asked me yesterday,30
NA,tbe f o l l o w i n g questions:-,30
NA,1. Is i t a 'fact tliat the owner of a,30
NA,"car registered in the Federal Territory,",30
NA,"wishes to enter New South Wales, has",30
NA,to report to the police of that State and obtain,30
NA,another number plate?,30
NA,"2. I f so, will lie endeavour to enter into",30
NA,reciprocal arrangements with the New South l o,30
NA,Wales authorities with a view to allowing cars Stores,30
NA,registered in tlie Territory to travel un-,30
NA,hampered through that State?,30
NA,I am now i n a p o s i t i o n to f u r n i s h the,30
NA,following particulars:-,30
NA,"1. Yes. i t is provided,",30
NA,a vehicle is not driven to any place which is,30
NA,more than 100 miles beyond the boundary of,30
NA,"New South Wales, and does not remain in",30
NA,New South Wales for a continuous period ex-,30
NA,"ceeding 14 days, the regulation shall uot",30
NA,apply if the driver notifies the entry of such,30
NA,vehicle at the poliec station nearest to the,30
NA,place of entry.,30
NA,2. The difficulty mentioned is not peculiar,30
NA,"to the Federal Capital Territory, but exists",30
NA,"between all States of the Commonwealth, and",30
NA,there have been several conferences between,30
NA,the motor registration authorities with the,30
NA,object of evolving some reciprocal arrangeSpicers,30
NA,ments which would be simpler than the existphone,30
NA,ing procedure. The difference in,30
NA,"of the motor registration law, particularly",30
NA,"regard to fees, is an obstacle.",30

NA,Now South Wales authorities in regard to the,30
NA,matter.,30

NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATION' .,34
NA,NA,34
NA,short statement by way of personal ex-,34
NA,planation. On Wednesday,34
NA,smarting under' a rather severe criticism,34
NA,published in one of the Sydney news-,34
NA,"papers, I had occasion to offer certain re-",34
NA,marks by way of protest. These have,34
NA,"been incorporated i n Hansard, and I have",34
NA,no wish to retract any of them.,34
NA,still say that to the best of my knowledge,34
NA,"and belief my statements were correct,",34
NA,"and, therefore, I should have no hesitation",34
NA,"in repeating them. Last evening, how-",34
NA,"ever, I received a letter, written on be-",34
NA,half of a number of the reporters i n the,34
NA,"press gallery, somewhat i n the f o r m of a",34
NA,"challenge, inviting me to furnis h the",34
NA,names of the persons who supplied me,34
NA,with the information on which my state-,34
NA,ments were based. I do not intend to,34
NA,"accept that challenge, because I cannot",34
NA,see that any good purpose would be served,34
NA,by doing so. I have every respect f o r the,34
NA,occupants of the press gallery. M y attack,34
NA,"was directed to one particular quarter,",34
NA,and I have no desire to continue that,34
NA,"attack. As fa r as I can learn,",34
NA,the Sydney newspapers up to the,34
NA,present have been silent regarding the,34
NA,"incident, and so f a r as I am concerned i t",34
NA,may be considered closed. Bu t i t would,34
NA,be wrong on my part to divulge the names,34
NA,of the persons who gave me my informa-,34

NA,Debate resumed f r o m 12th October (vide,34
Mr HILL ,,34
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,34
Mr LACEY ,Grey) [2.39] -Th e sub-,34
NA,ject-matter of this bill has already been,34
NA,"considered by the House, and the measure",34
NA,should receive the approval of honor-,34
NA,r able members generally. I n 1925 the,34
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Bruce) and the then,34
NA,"Premier of South Australia ( Mr Gunn),",34
NA,"came to an agreement, afterwards termed",35
NA,"the Bruce-Gunn agreement, which pro-",35
NA,vided for the construction of a railway,35
NA,"known as the north-south line, to connect",35
NA,Port Augusta and Alice SpringsIt also,35
NA,provided for the project now before the,35
NA,House. The Railways Acceptance Bill,35
NA,passed through this chamber with very,35
NA,little discussion. After the Minister for,35
NA,Works and Railways had made his,35
NA,"second-reading speech, I followed him,",35
NA,and the matter was further debated by,35
NA,the honorable member for Swan ( Mr.,35
NA,"Gregory), the honorable member for Ade-",35
NA,"laide ( Mr Yates), the honorable member",35
NA,"for Richmond ( Mr R. Green), the hon-",35
NA,NA,35
NA,and the honorable member for Boothby,35
NA,( Mr Duncan-Hughes). The second,35
NA,"reading was carried on the voices, and",35
NA,the bill went through the committee stage,35
NA,"without discussion, the third reading",35
NA,being agreed to immediately. Thus the,35
NA,project received the unanimous support,35
NA,of the House. Since it accepted the,35
NA,"agreement in the first instance, one can",35
NA,only assume that it is now prepared to,35
NA,"carry it out. Therefore, the measure",35
NA,should receive a speedy passage. During,35
NA,the previous discussion at least one hon-,35
NA,orable member mentioned that it might,35
NA,be necessary to inquire into the third-rail,35
NA,project. No third-rail section of con-,35
NA,siderable length is to be found in,35
NA,any part of Australia. The agree-,35
NA,ment set out where the line was,35
NA,"to start and end, and other mat-",35
NA,ters relating to the productivity of the,35
NA,country to be served were agreed upon. It,35
NA,was then necessary to refer the proposal,35
NA,"to the Public Works Committee, of which",35
NA,I have the honour to be a member. The,35
NA,committee pays careful attention to all,35
NA,matters placed before it; but because of,35
NA,the technical problems that arose,35
NA,"in this particular case, special at-",35
NA,tention was given to it. When,35
NA,the committee was completing its,35
NA,"report, I voted for an amendment sub-",35
NA,"mitted by the honorable member for Swan,",35
NA,who was then a member of the committee-,35
NA,That amendment provided that the 5 ft.,35
NA,3 iu. gauge from Salisbury to Red Hill,35
NA,"should be continued as far as Port Pirie,",35
NA,a break of gauge station established there,35
NA,and the 4 ft. 8^ in. gauge constructed,35
NA,from that point to Port Augusta.,35
NA,that time I considered that it would be,35
NA,Mr Lacey.,35
NA,possible to do something to bring about,35
NA,the unification of the gauges. When this,35
NA,railway project was being investigated by,35
NA,"the Public Works Committee, the branch",35
NA,lines from Hamley Bridge to Balaklava,35
NA,"and thence to Port Wakefield, and from",35
NA,Brinkworth to Snowtown and thence to,35
NA,Wallaroo were of 3 f t . 6 in. gauge.,35
NA,Those lines have now been converted to,35
NA,the 5 f t . 3 in. gauge. When the honor-,35
NA,able member for Swan . framed his,35
NA,"amendment his idea, no doubt, was to",35
NA,open negotiations with the South Aus-,35
NA,tralian Government with a view to con-,35
NA,verting the railway from Red H i l l to,35
NA,Port Pirie and the two branch lines to,35
NA,the 4 f t . Si in. gauge. By that means,35
NA,the railways on the western side of South,35
NA,Australia would have been of uniform,35
NA,"gauge. I t is, however, too late to open",35
NA,up negotiations with a view to doing,35
NA,"away with the third-rail project, because",35
NA,the South Australian railways which,35
NA,Were of the 3 f t . 6^-in. gauge have beeu,35
NA,"converted to the 5 f t . 3-in. gauge, and, i f",35
NA,the 4 f t . S^-in. gauge went through from,35
NA,Salisbury to Red H i l l alone it would,35
NA,mean a break of gauge at every,35
NA,junction on the Red H i l l to Port,35
NA,"Augusta line. That, of course, would",35
NA,not be in the interests of South Australia.,35
NA,I consider that the South Australian,35
NA,Government has not been fair to the,35
NA,Commonwealth Government so far as the,35
NA,conversion of gauges is concerned. In,35
NA,1921 the Prime Minister and State,35
NA,Premiers conferred respecting the uni-,35
NA,fication of our railway gauges. The,35
NA,following resolution was arrived at-,35
NA,The Commonwealth and the Premiers of the,35
NA,States agree to appoint a Railway Commis-,35
NA,sion and affirm that the Ministers for Rail-,35
NA,"ways of New South Wales, Victoria and the",35
NA,Commonwealth shall select the two members,35
NA,of the commission who are to be appointed,35
NA,from outside. Tho Commonwealth and the,35
NA,States agree to abide by the decision of this,35
NA,tribunal. The Commonwealth to bear one-,35
NA,"fifth of the total cost, and four-fifths to be",35
NA,borne by the five States concerned on a per,35
NA,capita basis.,35
NA,"The commission was appointed, and in",35
NA,"November, 1921, its report was con-",35
NA,sidered at a conference of Premiers with,35
NA,"the Prime Minister in Melbourne, when",35
NA,it was resolved-,35
NA,That the adoption of a uniform gauge is,35
NA,At in the opinion of tliis conference essential,35
NA,to the development and safety of the Common-,35
NA,wealth. That the commission's recommenda-,35
NA,tion of a 4 f t . 8*-in. gauge is accepted. The,35

NA,to the States a d r a f t agreement to give,36

NA,shall be communicated to and considered at,36
NA,a further conference in January. 1922.,36
NA,That further conference* was held in,36
NA,"Melbourne, but no decision was",36
NA,"arrived at. South Australia, when",36
NA,considering the conversion of a sec-,36
NA,tion of its railways from 3 f t . 6,36
NA,"in. to 5 f t . 3 in., should have",36
NA,"adopted the 4 f t . 8-J-in. gauge, and then",36
NA,there would have been no necessity for,36
NA,a third rail as is proposed under the bill.,36
NA,I voted for the amendment moved by the,36
NA,"honorable member for Swan, not because",36
NA,I feared that there would be any element,36
NA,of danger in the adoption of the third,36
NA,rail principle. I do not think that any,36
NA,member of the Public Works Committee,36
NA,who took part in the inquiry considered,36
NA,the third rail to be unsafe.,36
NA,dence in favour of the third rail over-,36
NA,weighed that in opposition to it. I shall,36
NA,refrain from quoting the evidence of,36
NA,"Commonwealth ofncials, because i t may",36
NA,be said that their opinions - would be,36
NA,biased. I shall quote first the evidence,36
NA,"of Mr Webb, the Chief Railways Com-",36
NA,missioner of South Australia.,36
Mr STEWART ,Woul d he not,36
NA,little biased?,36
Mr LACEY ,A s a matter of fact a,36
NA,newspaper report published the other day,36
NA,showed that he had a distinct bias the,36
NA,"other way, so that I shall be safe in quot-",36
NA,ing his evidence. He said-,36
NA,I was associated with a Colorado railway in,36
NA,"the TJnited Sates of America for twenty years,",36
NA,and I know that we had no difficulty with,36
NA,mixed gauges in that system. They proved to,36
NA,"be entirely practical and safe, and presented no",36
NA,"complications. Denver City, which is a larger",36
NA,"railway centre than any city in Australia, has",36
NA,mixed gauges. Wo found i t practicable to do,36
NA,all our railway work with mixed gauges there.,36
NA,"Mr Webb was dealing, not with the third-",36
NA,"rail principle, but with four rails on one",36
NA,permanent way. He also stated that some,36
NA,of the carriages of a train were of differ-,36
NA,"ent gauges, and yet no accidents occurred.",36
NA,His evidence continued- -,36
NA,Wit h 80 lb. rails on this section we get an,36
NA,average speed of 26 miles an hour. This speed,36
NA,could be increased with larger locomotives.,36
NA,There would be no necessity to limi t the speed,36
NA,on the third rail. There are 21 station,36
NA,"effect yards, and in addition three passenger,",36
NA,stopping places between Adelaide and Red H i l l .,36
NA,The third rail would offer no complications i n,36
NA,station yards. When we first discussed the,36
NA,third-rail proposal between Red H i l l and Ade-,36
NA,"laide, we thought i t might be necessary, in",36
NA,"order to avoid complications, to run around",36
NA,"certain stations, but we are now in a position",36
NA,to say positively that there w i l l be no addi-,36
NA,tional risk and no mechanical difficulties by,36
NA,running through the stations. . . . In,36
NA,Colorado we had a large mileage of two mixed,36
NA,"gauges, and over a small mileage we worked",36
NA,"even three gauges on one set of sleepers,",36
NA,"namely, 2 f t . , 3 f t . , and 4 f t . Si i n . lines. I n",36
NA,some cases we had three gauges in station,36
NA,yards. They were al l worked without addi-,36
NA,"tional risk, but necessarily they were more",36
NA,expensive to maintain. I regard the third rail,36
NA,as an expedient to meet such problems as we,36
NA,"have ih Australia, but every case should be",36
NA,considered on its merits. I should have no,36
NA,hesitation in recommending the third rail in,36
NA,"certain circumstances, because I know from ex-",36
NA,perience that i t does not mean additional risk.,36
NA,"Mr James M c G u i r e , South A u s t r a l i a n",36
NA,"R a i l w a y s Commissioner, gave the f o l l o w -",36
NA,i n g evidence-,36
NA,The evi- The additional cost of maintenance of a,36
NA,mixed gauge line would not be great. Wit h,36
NA,the third r a i l in operation there would be no,36
NA,"difficulty with the interlocking gear, or any",36
NA,additional risk of derailment. Whether a,36
NA,"third rail is used or not, i t is always easy to",36
NA,derail a train deliberately. There is nothing,36
NA,in connexion with the third rail which would,36
NA,tend to cause more derailments. There is no,36
NA,more danger of sand d r i f t with a third r a i l,36
NA,than there is now where the guard rail'is used.,36
NA,be a We have many miles of guard rail in South,36
NA,"Australia, and sometimes i t is within two",36
NA,inches of main rail. We have experienced no,36
NA,special trouble from sand drifts because of the,36
NA,existence of the guard rail. I t is all a matter,36
NA,maintenance. We have had two or three nasty,36
NA,smashes because of debris falling off trains and,36
NA,causing derailments. I have known of a bag of,36
NA,chaff causing a derailment. That risk would,36
NA,not be greater with a third rail. I n my,36
NA,opinion the third rail would neither increase,36
NA,nor decrease the danger of derailment. A t any,36
NA,time material falling from a truck constitutes,36
NA,a risk. I am satisfied that the risk is not in-,36
NA,creased by the third rail.,36
Mr STEWART ,Wha t is a guard rail i,36
Mr LACEY , A guard rail is one 0,36
NA,"that is placed adjacent to another rail,",36
NA,"generally at a curve,- for the purpose of",36
NA,making the flange of the wheels take the,36
NA,proper course. Guard rails are some-,36
NA,times used for considerable lengths at,36
NA,crossings and curves. Mr MCGuire,36
NA,pointed out that there is a space,36
NA,between the main running rail and,36
NA,"the guard rail, just as there is in",36
NA,"the third rail systems. The space, he",36
NA,"said, was smaller than in the third rail",37
NA,"system, and a jamb was, therefore, even time",37
NA,more likely to take place. I have quotamy,37
NA,tions here from the evidence given by tion,37
NA,experts before the committee. We had,37
NA,"before our committee Mr Ernest Stanley,",37
NA,the late representative and resident,37
NA,neer for the Transand.ine Railway Comthe,37
NA,pany. He stated-,37
NA,In the Argentine Republic I had actual,37
NA,experience from 11)12 to 1918 of the operathe,37
NA,"tion of a mixed-gauge system, over a section",37
NA,whicli handled very heavy freight,37
NA,passenger traffic. I was the supervising engi-,37
NA,"neer for the Transandine railway, which",37
NA,constructed on the metre gauge. As each,37
NA,tion was completed i t was let to the Great,37
NA,Western Railways Company which operated i t . the people of ' Australia.,37
NA,The Great Western Company's main system,37
NA,was constructed on the 5 f t . 0 in. gauge. Tlie,37
NA,mixed gauge section was about 4 | miles,37
NA,"length, and had a ruling grade of 1 in",37
NA,"lowest curve was of 9 chains radius, and the prove dangerous.",37
NA,maximum speed was about 35 miles an hour.,37
NA,During the time the third rail was under my,37
NA,"observation no accident occurred, and",37
NA,trouble was experienced i n operating the track at all.,37
NA,systemThe points for the 3 f t . o' in.,37
NA,5 f t . 0 in. lines were operated by one action. I,37
NA,can conceive that there would have been,37
NA,greater danger from obstacles lodging on,37
NA,line i f a 4 f t . Si in. gauge were built within construct.,37
NA,"the 5 f t . 3 in. gauge, but I would not be",37
NA,to install such a device. I t seems to mo suit-,37
NA,"able for tlie Adelaide to Port Augusta line,",37
NA,I apprehend no constructional difficulties,37
NA,danger to human life.,37
NA,That is evidence that should convince,37
NA,"most people, but in addition, there is",37
NA,"evidence of Mr Wilkin, a gentleman",37
NA,who has given more consideration to,37
NA,third rail system of railway construction,37
NA,than anybody else in Australia. Mr was,37
NA,Wilkin was inter-locking engineer,37
NA,the New South Wales Railways Departbogey,37
NA,"ment, and also held a similar position",37
NA,the South Australiau Railways Departfinding.,37
NA,ment. This is what Mr Wilkin had to,37
NA,say on the subject-,37
NA,I was interlocking engineer in the,37
NA,ISouth Wales Railway Department from 189.1,37
NA,"to 1913, and I held a similar position in",37
NA,Australia from 1882 to the end of 1890.,37
NA,have had experience of every railway,37
NA,"England, particularly the Great",37
NA,"line, as well as experience on the continent of",37
NA,"Europe, and iu other parts of the world. For line should not be constructed.",37
NA,"37 years that is from 1852 in 1889, a",37
NA,rail was in operation on the Great,37
NA,"line, over which trains run at a speed",37
NA,"will never be attained iu this country,",37
NA,from 00 to SO miles an hour. I suppose that the,37
NA,heaviest rail in the early days would be about,37
NA,"70 lb., although bitterly a heavier rail has been is not by any means the practice.",37
NA,employed. The gauges that were mixed,37
NA,"7 ft. 0* in. and 4 ""ft. SA in.",37
NA,Ilr. Laoey.,37
NA,thirteen years I have devoted the whole of my,37
NA,to the problem of unifying the 5 f t . 3 in.,37
NA,"and the 4 f t . 84 in. gauges, because, so far as",37
NA,"experience goes, and from what informa-",37
NA,"I can gather in other countries, the com-",37
NA,bination of those two gauges has never been,37
NA,attempted on the third-rail system.,37
NA,engi Mr Wilkin had very definite ideas on,37
NA,subject of railway points and cross-,37
NA,"ings, and his evidence should be sufficient",37
NA,to answer anybody who might criticize,37
NA,construction of this railway from the,37
NA,point of view of safety and efficieucy-,37
NA,and The evidence that has been given was,37
NA,"was sworn testimony, and some of the wit-",37
NA,secnesses had no interest in the matter other,37
NA,than to do their best in the interests of,37
NA,When this,37
NA,"inquiry was taking place, some witnesses",37
NA,in expressed themselves as being afraid that,37
NA,50: the the jwoposed third rail system would,37
NA,"One witness, in the",37
NA,"very early stages of our inquiry, said",37
NA,no that it would not be possible to lay this,37
NA,"Therefore, the peculiar",37
NA,and the position arose that we were inquiring,37
NA,into the construction of a railway that,37
NA,the one engineer said it was not possible to,37
NA,The argument used by him,37
NA,afraid was that the space between the 4 f t . 8 i,37
NA,and in. rail and the 5 f t . 3 in. rail'would not,37
NA,or be sufficient to allow of the dog spikes,37
NA,being driven in to fasten down the rail.,37
NA,"Later, however, when we were taking",37
NA,"evidence in Adelaide, we had a",37
NA,the practical demonstration of the laying,37
NA,"of such a line. New sleepers, new rails",37
NA,the and new dogs were used for the con-,37
NA,"struction of one length of line, and there",37
NA,no difficulty at all in driving the dog,37
NA,in spikes.. The whole objection was a.,37
NA,placed before the committee witli,37
NA,in the idea of prejudicing them in their,37
NA,I t was also stated that i f the,37
NA,"railway was built to the suggested gauge,",37
NA,it would not be possible to place the bolts,37
NA,"New through the rails alternately-tha t is, one",37
NA,South bolt from one direction and another bolt,37
NA,I from the opposite direction. A man who,37
NA,iu is supposed to be a very eminent engineer,37
NA,Western gave that as one of his reasons why the,37
NA,Since,37
NA,third that time I have taken notice of the,37
NA,"Western methods of railway construction, and I",37
NA,that have found that only now arid again are,37
NA,"namely, the bolts put through from opposite",37
NA,"directions, as stated by this engineer. I t",37
NA,He,37
NA,were said i t was necessary to place the bolts,37
NA,For the last,37
NA,through the rails in this way because,38
NA,otherwise the flange of the wheels might,38
NA,cut all the nuts off. ancl allow the rails,38
NA,"to spread. The obvious remedy, of",38
NA,"course, would be to place all the bolts",38
NA,"through the other way, and then none of",38
NA,the nuts would be cut off. When,38
NA,the honorable the Minister was intro-,38
NA,"ducing this bill, he pointed out the very",38
NA,many advantages that would accrue f r o m,38
NA,"the building of this line, but as there",38
NA,seems to be some opposition to the pro-,38
NA,"posal at the present time, I shall",38
NA,enumerate some of the benefits as pointed,38
NA,out to the commission-,38
NA,(1) I t would reduce by about 70 miles tbe,38
NA,length of the journey between Adelaide and,38
NA,"Port Augusta, and the time occupied from",38
NA,eleven and a half hours to six and a half,38
NA,hours.,38
NA,(2) I t would permit of passengers and,38
NA,loading being conveyed direct from Adelaide,38
NA,"to Kalgoorlie, obviating the delay and expense",38
NA,at present incurred in transhipment at,38
NA,Terowie and Port Augusta.,38
NA,(3) l t would curtail by eight and a half,38
NA,to nine and a half hours the time at present,38
NA,occupied in the train journev from Adelaide,38
NA,to Perth.,38
NA,(4) I t would enable live-stock from the,38
NA,trans-Australian railway to be conveyed from,38
NA,point of loading to market in the same,38
NA,vehicles.,38
NA,(5) I t would permit of live stock being,38
NA,ducted from Port Augusta to Dry Creek in,38
NA,ten to twelve hours. At present 25 hours,38
NA,elapse between the arrival of live-stock at,38
NA,Port Augusta and time of arrival at Dry,38
NA,Creek.,38
NA,(0) I t would provide a line ou which on,38
NA,"each train 85 per cent, more loading could be",38
NA,"carried from. Port Augusta, and 54 per cent,",38
NA,to Port Augusta.,38
NA,(7) I t would accelerate the mail service to,38
NA,and from Western Australia; the outward,38
NA,English mail would leave Melbourne and,38
NA,"Adelaide later, and the inward English mail",38
NA,would be delivered in Adelaide on Fridays,38
NA,"instead of Saturdays, and would arrive iu",38
NA,sufficient time in Melbourne to euable delivery,38
NA,to be effected on tlie first round on Saturday,38
NA,morning instead of Monday.,38
NA,(8) I t would be sufficiently revenue pro-,38
NA,"ducing to at once pay working expenses, and",38
NA,"a considerable portion, if not the whole, of",38
NA,the interest.,38
NA,(9) I t would permit of the quotation of a,38
NA,through rate to Adelaide for live-stock from,38
NA,the trans-Australian and the railway to Alice,38
NA,"Springs, instead of being compelled to adopt",38
NA,the South Australian rate for portion of tlie,38
NA,distance.,38
NA,"The last point raised, that of the m i n i -",38
NA,"mum rates, is a burning question at the",38
NA,present time. Another reason given to,38
NA,the commission was that i t would i n -,38
NA,crease the revenue of the trans-Australian,38
NA,"railway by approximately £35,000, due to",38
NA,the stimulation of through traffic. World,38
NA,"tourists, who have travelled over the",38
NA,"trans-Australian railway, always speak",38
NA,eulogistically of the journey be-,38
NA,tween Port Augusta and Kal-,38
NA,goorlie. Only recently I did the t r i p,38
NA,"myself, and coming back, I met",38
NA,a much-travelled gentleman with,38
NA,whom I discussed the subject of,38
NA,railway facilities. I said that I con-,38
NA,sidered the trans-Australian train was,38
NA,the best in the Commonwealth. He,38
NA,replied that i t was not only the best i n,38
NA,"the Commonwealth, but was, i n his",38
NA,"opinion, the best i n the world. I should",38
NA,also like to mention something that hap-,38
NA,pened on the same t r i p. We arrived at,38
NA,Port Augusta on Sunday morning. A,38
NA,bus runs f r o m Port Augusta to Adelaide,38
NA,"every morning, and, notwithstanding the",38
NA,fact that the passengers had through tic-,38
NA,"kets f r o m Perth to Adelaide, some of",38
NA,"them got off at Port Augusta, and went",38
NA,by bus to Adelaide.,38
Mr MANN , T h e r e is an increasing,38
NA,number of people who do the same thing.,38
Mr LACEY , I t is no loss to the rail -,38
NA,"conway, because the passengers have bought",38
NA,"tickets through to Adelaide, but i t is",38
NA,a poor advertisement f o r our rail -,38
NA,ways. While passengers are waiting at,38
NA,"Port Augusta f or transhipment, i t would",38
NA,"be possible, during those two and a half",38
NA,"hours, to get right down past Red H i l l .",38
NA,The construction of this line would,38
NA,""" boost"" the railway to such tin extent",38
NA,"that the revenue would increase greatly,",38
NA,because of the advertisement given to the,38
NA,"system, and the increased facilities",38
NA,afforded to the public. Those who have,38
NA,advocated the construction of this line,38
NA,have never claimed that i t would lead to,38
NA,the development of the country through,38
NA,which i t would pass. They have based,38
NA,their advocacy on other grounds. B u t I,38
NA,maintain that it w i l l have an effect upon,38
NA,the development of the country which i t,38
NA,"w i l l traverse. On the 19th October last,",38
NA,the Adelaide Advertiser published what,38
NA,was allegedly an interview with Mr W.,38
NA,"A. Webb, Commissioner of Railways i n",38
NA,that State. Immediately i t was brought,38
NA,to my notice I submitted to the Prime,38
NA,"Minister a question relating to i t , and",38
NA,received a satisfactory reply. The article,38
NA,"is headed "" Federal Railway Schemes "" ;",39
NA,""" Bed HiU Line of no Advantage"";",39
NA,""" Port Augusta-Hay Line Unnecessary "" ;",39
NA,"""Uniform Gauge the Height of Polly.""",39
NA,I t reads-,39
NA,The Railways Commissioner ( Mr W. A .,39
NA,Webb) does not view w i t h favour the proposal,39
NA,of tlie Federal Government to construct a line,39
NA,of railway from Port Augusta to Red H i l l and,39
NA,a third rai l from Red H i l l to Adelaide. Among,39
NA,his objections are the following:-,39
NA,Such construction would not develop one,39
NA,"additional acre of land, and would be a need-",39
NA,less duplication of existing rail facilities.,39
NA,The present business interchanged at Port,39
NA,"Augusta, both passenger and freight, is so",39
NA,small there cannot be found any business or,39
NA,economic reason for the expenditure of the,39
NA,money required. I t would take a very large,39
NA,volume of freight traffic to j u s t i fy the,39
NA,"sary expenditure, and the following statement,",39
NA,"showing total tonnage, east and west, through",39
NA,"Port Augusta, shows the total absence of any",39
NA,reason for the new construction:-,39

NA,"1926-27 .. . . 2,508 „",39
NA,"Some time ago, Mr ""Webb, as I have",39
NA,"already mentioned, gave evidence before",39
NA,the Commonwealth Public Works Com-,39
NA,mittee. Only the other day I heard,39
NA,an honorable member of this House say,39
NA,that Mr Webb had not given his ap-,39
NA,proval to the building of this railway.,39
NA,Here is his sworn evidence on the point:,39
NA,My approval was sought concerning,39
NA,"general terms of the agreement, butnot speciwill",39
NA,"fically as to its details. Generally speaking,",39
NA,"i t meets with my approval, although I do not",39
NA,think that South Australia w i l l gain,39
NA,much from i t . That State w i l l have,39
NA,vantage of the third rail connexion between,39
NA,"Red H i l l and Port Pirie, and i t is giving the",39
NA,Commonwealth Government a very valuable,39
NA,concession by allowing i t to bring its railwav,39
NA,line through the heart of the best area i,39
NA,State and into the Adelaide railway station,39
NA,yard. The users of the Commonwealth rail-,39
NA,way will gain very much by this concession.,39
NA,Further on he stated-,39
NA,The proposed line may take some live,39
NA,"revenue, and, perhaps, a little passenger",39
NA,ness from tlie State railway system.,39
NA,Commonwealth and State w i l l have joint use grazing to a much greater extent.,39
NA,"of the permanent way, station yards,",39
NA,"buildings, and although there maj' be differRed",39
NA,"ences of opinion, and, perhaps, occasionally",39
NA,"family quarrels, we do not expect that serious",39
NA,friction will result from tlie arrangement.,39
NA,"According to the newspaper report,",39
NA,condemned the railway; yet in his evi-,39
NA,dence before the committee he approved between,39
NA,Mr Lacey.,39
NA,"of its construction, and said that no diffi-",39
NA,culties would arise because of it. One,39
NA,cannot escape the conclusion that,39
NA,he has been misreported by the,39
NA,press. His sworn evidence is the,39
NA,best guide that we could have in com-,39
NA,ing to a decision on this matter. I claim,39
NA,that the facilities which will be provided,39
NA,will have a tendency to promote closer,39
NA,settlement along the portion of the route,39
NA,that is in South Australia. Mr.,39
NA,"Coffey, of Lake View, a large land-",39
NA,holder and a most prosperous farmer in,39
NA,"that district, in evidence before the Public",39
NA,"Works Committee, said-",39
NA,The distance from Red H i l l to Wallaroo is,39
NA,"56 miles, and from Red H i l l to Port Pirie i t is",39
NA,neces28 miles. The line would take the wheat from,39
NA,at least half the distance between Port Pirie,39
NA,"and Wallaroo, to Port Pirie as the shipping",39
NA,"port. Last year we reaped 23,000 bags at Lake'",39
NA,View. AU this wheat would naturally go to,39
NA,Port Pirie. I believe that the higher price,39
NA,""" for wheat which would then be realized at Port",39
NA,""" Pirie would result in certain properties, which",39
NA,"are now carrying sheep, being turned over for",39
NA,""" wheat production. Some of the land in my",39
NA,district is not being utilized to its fullest capa-,39
NA,"city, and I feel sure that country which carries",39
NA,"only a sheep or a little more to the acre, and",39
NA,which is capable of producing up to 35 bushels,39
NA,"to the acre, will eventually be put to better",39
NA,use.,39
NA,I t is well known that the nearer you are,39
NA,to a. port the better is the price you obtain,39
NA,for your produce. I n addition to that,39
NA,"advantage, the extra facilities will-induce",39
NA,settlers to plant wheat instead of to graze,39
NA,"the sheep, and a greater number of people",39
NA,be settled on the land. Giving evi-,39
NA,dence at Port Pirie a representative of,39
NA,very shipping interests said that wheat was,39
NA,the adbeing carted to Port Pirie from Wan-,39
NA,"dearah, a distance in some instances of",39
NA,22 miles; but with the construction of,39
NA,the line the longest cartage for farmers,39
NA,"n the there would be only about 12 miles, and",39
NA,"the average about 7 miles, assuming that",39
NA,sidings were placed in the most convenient,39
NA,places. Honorable members can appre-,39
NA,ciate the fact that i f farmers are faced,39
NA,stock with the necessity to cart wheat up to a,39
NA,"busidistance of 22 miles, they will engage ih""",39
NA,The,39
NA,The,39
NA,"and Wandearah district, which is between",39
NA,"H i l l and Port Pirie, does not pro-",39
NA,duce only a few bags of wheat; it is one,39
NA,of the best wheat-growing centres iu,39
NA,South Australia. The evidence given by,39
NA,he Mr R. J. Davidson was as follows:-,39
NA,There is a good number of settlers on land',39
NA,the 3-chain road and the coast. For,39
NA,the last 40 years we have had to cart our pro-,40
NA,"duce to Port Pirie, in some instances a distance",40
NA,of 18 or 20 miles. The roads are fairly good.,40
NA,"My place is in Wandearah West, 18 miles from",40
NA,Port Pirie. I am on the 3-chain road,40
NA,"near Butler's Bridge, and about 10 miles",40
NA,from the surveyed route. I would cart my,40
NA,produce to the railway. At present i t takes,40
NA,me two days to go to Port Pirie and return.,40
NA,I could do a trip a day to the railway line.,40
NA,"A t a later stage, he said-",40
NA,There is a good deal of settlement further,40
NA,out south and south-west of my place. A l l,40
NA,those people are interested in this proposal.,40
NA,Farmers from the Hundred of Mundoora would,40
NA,cart to the line.,40
NA,I should like honorable members to note,40
NA,particularly the following quotation f r o m,40
NA,the evidence of the same gentleman:-,40
NA,We would use tlie railway in preference to,40
NA,motor lorries for the cartage of our produce.,40
NA,"About 100,000 bags of wheat were produced",40
NA,"here last year, as well as a fair number of",40
NA,cattle and sheep.,40
NA,Is tliere any district i n Australia whose,40
NA,production equals that but which does,40
NA,not possess greater facilities f or sending,40
NA,produce to market than haulage over 22,40
NA,miles of road? The same witness also,40
NA,stated-,40
NA,I t costs me from Is. to Is. 2d. a bag,40
NA,my wheat to Port Pirie. The suggested devia-,40
NA,tion will mean a difference in cartage of,40
NA,-» 3 miles to me. This represents about 2d. a,40
NA,bag.,40
NA,He was referring to a deviation which,40
NA,was being sought at that time.,40
NA,nexion with the development of that dis-,40
NA,"trict, the witness stated-",40
NA,There is a possibility of developing,40
NA,gardening operations along the Broughton,40
NA,River if the railway facilities are satisfactory.,40
NA,Some excellent fruit is grown under irrigation,40
NA,in the district.,40
NA,"Mr Brechin, of the same district, stated",40
NA,in evidence^-,40
NA,Since 1915 my average production,40
NA,about 16 bushels an acre,40
NA,carry more stock if we had better railway,40
NA,"facilities, but I doubt if",40
NA,"be put under cultivation for wheat, as we crop",40
NA,practically all the land that is available.,40
NA,costs from Is. 2d. to Is. 3d. a bag to cart,40
NA,"wheat to Port Pirie, a distance of about 20",40
NA,miles. Land along the river Broughton,40
NA,"splendid lucerne country, and suitable",40
NA,dairying.,40
NA,That should remove f r o m the minds,40
NA,honorable members any idea that this,40
NA,railway w i l l pass through desert or even,40
NA,barren country.,40
Mr SCULLIN ,Ha s i t a good rain-,40
NA,fail?,40
Mr LACEY ,Yes . I t is one of the,40
NA,best districts i n South Australia. Some,40
NA,honorable members may ask what the,40
NA,production is likely to be this year. U n -,40
NA,"fortunately, i t has suffered f r o m drought",40
NA,"conditions, but i t is not alone i n that re-",40
NA,spect. This w i l l be only the second,40
NA,failure that has been experienced by the,40
NA,district. That takes us as f a r as Port,40
NA,"Pirie, up to which the 5 f t . 3 i n . gauge",40
NA,w i l l be constructed. On the other side of,40
NA,"Port Pirie, where the gauge w i l l be 4 f t .",40
NA,"8$ in., the country f or the first 26 to 30",40
NA,miles consists of good wheat-growing land.,40
NA,The portion of the country to be,40
NA,served by the proposed railway is i n the,40
NA,Hundred of Baroota. I am f u l l y con-,40
NA,versant with the country along the pro-,40
NA,"posed route, as I live i n the locality, and",40
NA,have been over i t on many occasions. Mr .,40
NA,"H i l l a m, who lives 18 miles north of Port",40
NA,"Germein, which is 18 miles by road f r o m",40
NA,"Port Pirie, and 26 miles by rail , i n giving",40
NA,"evidence before the Public ""Works Com-",40
NA,mittee said-,40
NA,Wheat is carted 18 miles to Port Germein,40
NA,"from the north and east, and from the south",40
NA,for a distance of about 7 miles. As a practical,40
NA,to cart farmer I would say that if I were 12 miles,40
NA,"from Port Germein, and if there were a rail-",40
NA,"way siding within 4 miles, I would send my",40
NA,wheat over the line. Usually the price at Port,40
NA,Pirie is a i d. a bushel better than at Port,40
NA,Germein. Very rarely is it a penny liigher.,40
NA,I would rather ship wheat from this port than,40
NA,"I n con- from Port Pirie, because we have a good port",40
NA,"here, and if we had railway connexion i t would",40
NA,develop,40
NA,"marketLater on, Mr H i l l a m stated-",40
NA,This is an early district for fattening stock.,40
NA,"If we had the railway, we would have a good",40
NA,outlet at Port Pirie. Many farmers do not,40
NA,core to send their fat sheep and lambs to,40
NA,"market, owing to the distance and the absence",40
NA,of railway facilities. I believe tliat the rail-,40
NA,way will induce many stock-owners to raise,40
NA,has been fat lambs for the Adelaide market,40
NA,I could Stock-raising on the country to tlie north of,40
NA,my place will probably be developed with the,40
NA,a greater area will railway line.,40
NA,I t That is the evidence of an experienced,40
NA,"farmer who lives i n the district, and wliich",40
NA,is disproves the suggestion that the proposed,40
NA,for route is through very poor country. The,40
NA,"position is the reverse, as the line w i l l",40
NA,of serve country cajJable of heavy produc-,40
NA,tion. The construction of the railway,40
NA,w i ll also expedite transport over the east-,40
NA,"west line, and w i l l provide facilities",40
NA,which are badly needed i n the imme-,40
NA,diate locality. I t has been suggested,40
NA,recently that a technical difficulty is,41
NA,likely to prevent the construction of,41
NA,the line. I f that is the case it is not due,41
NA,to the terms of the agreement entered into,41
NA,between the Premier of South Australia,41
NA,and the Prime Minister. The clause in,41
NA,the schedule of the Railway Agreement,41
NA,Act of 1926 relating to the construction,41
NA,of this line reads-,41
NA,{d) In approving and consenting to the said,41
NA,railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill the,41
NA,State may if it thinks fit provide that sueh,41
NA,approval and consent sliall lapse and be of no,41
NA,effect if the construction of that railway is,41
NA,not commenced by the Commonwealth within,41
NA,a period to be specified by the Premier of tlie,41
NA,State not being less than three years from the,41
NA,date of such approval and consent.,41
NA,I f construction is started within three,41
NA,years. South Australia can raise no ob-,41
NA,jection. I f there is any technical diffi-,41
NA,culty it is not due to the terms of the,41
NA,"agreement to which 1 have referred, and",41
NA,which the South Australian Parliament,41
NA,ratified shortly after it had been,41
NA,"adopted, by this Parliament.",41
NA,"proposed route . is, in my opinion,",41
NA,not altogether the best that could,41
NA,be obtained. I have always been of the,41
NA,opinion that on approaching Port Pirie,41
NA,the railway should extend a Httle to,41
NA,". the westward, and thus avoid dividing",41
NA,many agricultural farms in the locality.,41
NA,I do not stress the point to the extent,41
NA,"of holding up the bill now, but merely",41
NA,"mention it, so that the Minister may give",41
NA,the matter consideration. The Public,41
NA,"Works Committee, as I have already",41
NA,"said, obtained, valuable evidence from",41
NA,"Mr Wilkin, who is an expert on",41
NA,the third-rail system. The members,41
NA,of the committee regard Mr Wilkin as,41
NA,an authority who can give the Common-,41
NA,wealth valuable ndvice. A paragraph in,41
NA,the report of the committee on this phase,41
NA,of the project reads-,41
NA,"During the progress of its investigations, the",41
NA,committee took evidence from Mr Charles,41
NA,"Wilkin, formerly Interlocking Engineer in the",41
NA,"New South Wales Railway Department, and",41
NA,examined models submitted by him for dealing,41
NA,with break of gauge between 4 f t . Si in. and,41
NA,5 f t . 3-in. railway tracks. Tlie committee was,41
NA,"much impressed with the system described, and",41
NA,recommends that careful cpnsideration be given,41
NA,to this scheme before deciding on the system,41
NA,of points and crossings to be adopted.,41
NA,I bring that under the notice of the,41
NA,Minister in the hope that his department,41
NA,"will confer with Mr Wilkin, who, since",41
NA,Mr Laoey.,41
NA,"he has retired from the service, has given",41
NA,the third-rail system very close attention.,41
NA,The Works and Railways Department,41
NA,should also negotiate with tbe Western,41
NA,Australian Government and endeavour to,41
NA,facilitate the conversion of the gauge of,41
NA,the railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie to,41
NA,that of the East-West line. TJhder an,41
NA,"agreement, which has since lapsed, that",41
NA,work should have been undertaken on,41
NA,the completion of the East-West railway.,41
NA,"Nothing, however, has been done, and the",41
NA,passengers travelling from Perth to the,41
NA,"East, and vice versa, incur considerable",41
NA,inconvenience owing to the break of,41
NA,gauge at Kalgoorlie. I also direct the,41
NA,attention of the Minister to the fact that,41
NA,although second class sleeping accommo-,41
NA,dation is provided on the East-West,41
NA,line,41
Mr MANN ,O n the Western Aus-,41
NA,"tralian section, too.",41
Mr LACEY ,Yes ; but such accom-,41
NA,modation is not provided between Ade-,41
NA,The laide and Melbourne. There should not,41
NA,be any hostility between the Common-,41
NA,wealth and State railway authorities in,41
NA,this matter. The conditions throughout,41
NA,such a long journey should be uniform.,41
NA,I trust the Minister for Works and Rail-,41
NA,ways will negotiate with the Victorian *-,41
NA,Railways Commissioners with a view to,41
NA,second class sleeping accommodation,41
NA,being provided between Adelaide and,41
NA,Melbourne. This convenience is provided,41
NA,on the Commonwealth railways between,41
NA,"Kalgoorlie ancl Port Augusta, but",41
NA,not between Quorn and Oodnadatta.,41
NA,From time to time money is voted,41
NA,"for ballasting the East-West line,",41
NA,and each year a. small section is,41
NA,completed; but. as the line will,41
NA,"eventually be ballasted for its full length,",41
NA,it seems false economy to do the work in,41
NA,sections. When the work is completed,41
NA,"trains will be able io travel faster, and",41
NA,with the added facilities provided in this,41
NA,bill it may then be necessary to run a,41
NA,train each day instead of three trains a,41
NA,week as at present.,41
Mr MANN ,B y reducing the time,41
NA,taken fewer stations would be required,41
NA,and the housing accommodation on the,41
NA,plains would be greatly improved.,41
Mr LACEY ,Yes ; that is another,41
NA,"important phase of the question, and one",41
NA,which I have not time to deal with,41
NA,.now. As there are large numbers of,41
NA,unemployed in South Australia at pre-,42
NA,sent-th e position having become aggra-,42
NA,vated owing to a dearth of overseas to-,42
NA,shipping- I ask the Minister i f construc-,42
NA,tion work on the proposed railway,42
NA,not be commenced at Port Augusta and,42
NA,Eed H i l l simultaneously. Immediate,42
NA,attention should be given to the laying,42
NA,"of a third rail from Adelaide to Bed Hill,",42
NA,"as provided for in this bill, and that work",42
NA,could be started very soon. Tb>,42
NA,labour position in South Australia,42
NA,"is at present very acute, and i f any relief",42
NA,can be given in the direction suggested a,42
NA,large number of deserving men in South,42
NA,Australia will benefit. I trust this,42
NA,"proposal will be discussed on its merits,",42
NA,and that the Minister will give serious,42
NA,consideration to the points I have raised.,42
Mr FOSTER ,Wakefield) f3.44] - I,42
NA,consider it obligatory upon me to com-,42
NA,mence my speech on this important,42
NA,"proposal at this juncture, as the honor-",42
NA,"able member for Grey ( Mr Lacey) has,",42
NA,"unwittingly, I think, done an injustice to",42
NA,an important officer in the South Aus-,42
NA,tralian Public Service. I refer to the,42
NA,Chief Commissioner of Bailways in that,42
NA,"State ( Mr Webb), who, I submit, was",42
NA,not asked by the Labour Government in,42
NA,"South Australia to make a report, and, to",42
NA,"put it bluntly, was not allowed to do so.",42
NA,Mr Webb was not asked by the South,42
NA,Australian Labour Government to re-,42
NA,port upon tbe proposal which has now,42
NA,become the subject of an agreement,42
NA,between the Commonwealth and South,42
NA,Australian Governments.,42
Mr LACEY , I say that he approved,42
NA,of it.,42
Mr FOSTER ,"H e did not, nor would",42
NA,he do so. He was not asked to express,42
NA,his opinion upon it. I have a document,42
NA,of six pages from which I shall quote to,42
NA,establish my assertion. I do not know,42
NA,whether an instance of this kind has ever,42
NA,before occurred in South Australia or,42
NA,elsewhere. I ask leave to continue my,42
NA,remarks at a later date.,42

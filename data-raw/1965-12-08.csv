Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Sir John MCLeay),14
NA,"took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read",14
NA,prayers.,14
NA,PENSIONS.,14
NA,Mr LINDSAY presented a petition from,14
NA,certain electors of the Commonwealth,14
NA,praying that the Parliament will amend the,14
NA,social services legislation to give an imme-,14
NA,diate increase in the basic pension rate paid,14
NA,to all social service pensioners.,14
NA,Petition received.,14
NA,BOOKLET ON VIETNAM.,14
Mr GALVIN , I ask the Prime Minis-,14
NA,ter a question. Is he aware that the South,14
NA,Australian Minister for Education has,14
NA,stated that he has requested school teachers,14
NA,in South Australia not to use the booklet,14
NA,on Vietnam issued by the Department of,14
NA,External Affairs until he has had time to,14
NA,examine it? Will the Prime Minister give an,14
NA,assurance that no more of these booklets,14
NA,will go to South Australia until the wishes,14
NA,of the South Australian Minister for Educa-,14
NA,"tion are known? Further, before sending",14
NA,these booklets to other States will the,14
NA,Prime Minister consult with State Ministers,14
NA,for Education?,14
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ,Ther e is no,14
NA,obligation on any teacher to use this booklet,14
NA,or to discuss it with his pupils. The booklet,14
NA,is designed to inform headmasters of,14
NA,"schools, clergymen and various social and",14
NA,other leaders in the community. I would be,14
NA,surprised to know that we cannot distribute,14
NA,a piece of literature relating to a matter,14
NA,within our jurisdiction without the consent,14
NA,of a State Minister.,14
NA,Mr Courtnay -Sen d them the Vernon,14
NA,report.,14
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ,Tha t is not a,14
NA,bad idea.,14
NA,SHIPPING.,14
Mr HAWORTH , I ask the Minister for,14
NA,Labour and National Service a question,14
NA,concerning the hold up of the tanker,14
NA,"""Oceanic Grandeur"" by members of the",14
NA,Australian Seamen's Union. It has been,14
NA,F.14706/65 -R -[134 ],14
NA,alleged that the hold up is due to a broken,14
NA,implied agreement between Ampol Petro-,14
NA,leum Ltd. and the Seamen's Union to man,14
NA,"the "" P. J. Adams"" with an Australian",14
NA,crew after the company had been granted,14
NA,a subsidy of Â£1 million by the Australian,14
NA,"Government. Is this claim correct? If not,",14
NA,what is the reason for this precipitate action,14
NA,Petition. by the Australian Seamen's Union?,14
Mr MCMAHON ," The "" Oceanic",14
NA,"Grandeur "" has been held up in Moreton",14
NA,Bay by the tugboat employees' organisation.,14
NA,I am not certain whether members of that,14
NA,organisation are members of the Australian,14
NA,Seamen's Union. The alleged ground for,14
NA,the hold up is that a verbal agreement,14
NA,between the Ampol company and the tug-,14
NA,boat employees has not been observed. In,14
NA,order to prevent this hold up continuing,14
NA,we have been in close consultation with,14
NA,our colleagues in Queensland. I have ascer-,14
NA,tained that the tugboat employees' organi-,14
NA,sation is not here operating under the Com-,14
NA,monwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act,14
NA,but comes within the jurisdiction of the,14
NA,Queensland Industrial Commission. The,14
NA,Queensland authorities have informed my,14
NA,Department today that the matter will imme-,14
NA,diately come before Mr Commissioner,14
NA,Harvey. It is hoped that very shortly he will,14
NA,bc able to call the parties together with a,14
NA,view to resolving the dispute quickly.,14
NA,IMMIGRATION.,14
Mr SEXTON ,M y question is directed,14
NA,to the Minister for Immigration. Can he,14
NA,"tell the House why 4,000 migrants- a",14
NA,record number-lef t Australia during the,14
NA,September quarter? Can he say what the,14
NA,action of these unsatisfied migrants will cost,14
NA,Australia?,14
Mr OPPERMAN ,Th e honorable mem-,14
NA,ber's question covers a very wide subject.,14
NA,"Actually, migrants are reaching Australia",14
NA,in record numbers. More migrants are,14
NA,coming here now than have ever come,14
NA,before and naturally the number of those,14
NA,leaving Australia will be higher than it was,14
NA,"before. However, the proportion of those",14
NA,"returning overseas, related to the total num-",14
NA,"ber arriving in Australia, remains much",14
NA,the same. Economic conditions overseas are,14
NA,now much better than they were in the days,14
NA,gone by and migrants who believe that,14
NA,they will be able to get employment that,14
NA,they were denied before are attracted to,15
NA,return to their homelands. This emphasises,15
NA,the point that I made when I returned from,15
NA,my recent trip. I said then that we will have,15
NA,increasing difficulty in attracting migrants,15
NA,to Australia because conditions overseas are,15
NA,"improving. However, that does not alter",15
NA,the fact that good advertising overseas and,15
NA,"the efforts of our dedicated representatives,",15
NA,who are responsible for implementing our,15
NA,"migration scheme, have resulted in Australia",15
NA,receiving a record number of migrants.,15
NA,Many of the migrants who leave Australia,15
NA,do not do so because they are dissatisfied.,15
NA,Domestic affairs cause some migrants to,15
NA,"return to their homelands. In addition, Aus-",15
NA,tralia is a country with a high level of,15
NA,wages and migrants can save their fares to,15
NA,go back to the countries of their birth. This,15
NA,means that we in Australia should use our,15
NA,best efforts to satisfy the needs of migrants.,15
NA,But no country in the world has a better,15
NA,understanding of these needs than Australia,15
NA,has and no country gives migrants the wel-,15
NA,come that Australia gives. We have Good,15
NA,"Neighbour Councils, Bring Out a Briton",15
NA,associations and churches all working to,15
NA,improve the lot of the migrants here.,15
NA,Although the honorable member may feel,15
NA,that the number of migrants leaving Aus-,15
NA,"tralia is large, Australia has the lowest",15
NA,rate of return of any immigration country.,15
NA,One country that is competing with us has,15
NA,a rate of return of 30 per cent.; our rate is,15
NA,"10 per cent, or so. In addition, 60 per",15
NA,of migrants who return to their homelands,15
NA,want to come back to Australia.,15
Mr CALWELL , I ask the Minister for,15
NA,Immigration a supplementary question.,15
NA,Admitting the truth of all that he has said,15
NA,about the success of our immigration,15
NA,"policy in attracting and holding migrants,",15
NA,will the Minister investigate the possibility,15
NA,of retaining some of those who want to go,15
NA,back and of attracting more by asking,15
NA,colleagues to provide houses in advance,15
NA,"for migrants who wish to come here, after",15
NA,the Government has provided houses for to,15
NA,Australians who wish to marry and for those,15
NA,who cannot obtain houses today?,15
Mr OPPERMAN ,Th e honorable memused,15
NA,ber raises a matter of policy that is not,15
NA,"directly related to immigration. However,",15
NA,point out that we have hostels for migrants,15
NA,who come here. Similar hostels are not,15
NA,provided in other countries. Many migrants,15
NA,in hostels are quite happy to be tbere. The,15
NA,Government has a scheme of hostel subsidies,15
NA,which allows migrants to save for the pur-,15
NA,pose of buying a house. We have always,15
NA,stressed the need to have sponsored migra-,15
NA,"tion to Australia. In this scheme, the",15
NA,sponsor would have accommodation ready,15
NA,for the migrant. I repeat what I said recently,15
NA,in answer to a question. The Liberal Go-,15
NA,vernment that was in office in South Aus-,15
NA,tralia for a long time developed an excellent,15
NA,housing scheme and that State provided,15
NA,more personal nominations for migrants,15
NA,than did any other State. I add that the,15
NA,length of the stay in migrant hostels has,15
NA,fallen from the original average of two,15
NA,years to an average now of eight months.,15
NA,This would suggest that there has been an,15
NA,improvement in housing.,15
NA,HOUSING FINANCE.,15
Sir JOHN CRAMER , My question is,15
NA,directed to the Treasurer. In recent,15
NA,announcements of additional finance being,15
NA,"made available for housing, emphasis was'",15
NA,given to loans for new housing to stimulate,15
NA,the building industry. No mention was made,15
NA,of the need forfinancefor the purchase of,15
NA,existing and older homes. Is the Treasurer,15
NA,aware that the maximum stimulus is given,15
NA,to the building industry if finance is made,15
NA,available without discrimination between,15
NA,"cent, new or old homes, or between existing",15
NA,homes or homes to be built? Will he see to,15
NA,it that this economic fact is fully under-,15
NA,stood by Treasury officials and those dealing,15
NA,with housing finance?,15
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Lik e others in,15
NA,the House I respect the particular know-,15
NA,ledge which the honorable gentleman has of,15
NA,the housing industry. He speaks with some,15
NA,"authority on these matters, lt is true that",15
NA,his in the announcement made recently the,15
NA,Governor of the Reserve Bank said that in,15
NA,approaching savings banks and proposing,15
NA,them that they increase their current high,15
NA,level of lending for housing purposes he,15
NA,had suggested that the increased lending,15
NA,should preferably be for new rather than,15
NA,houses. I think the objective was to,15
NA,give some quick stimulus to new building,15
NA,I in view of a situation in which there had,15
NA,been some decline from the level of con-,15
NA,struction in an earlier period of the year.,15
NA,"As the honorable gentleman points out, it",15
NA,may be that we could well achieve a some-,16
NA,what similar result if finance went to a,16
NA,person who sells a house and with the pro-,16
NA,ceeds of that sale sets about building a new,16
NA,home. But usually there is involved in this,16
NA,a lag sufficiently long for the bank,16
NA,to have taken the view that in present cir-,16
NA,cumstances the quick response looked for,16
NA,could be got more realistically by lending,16
NA,"for new housing purposes. However, Sir,",16
NA,I respect the views the honorable member,16
NA,has on this matter and I will be glad to,16
NA,pursue his suggestions further with those,16
NA,who are very much more knowledgable,16
NA,on the matter than I am. In particular I,16
NA,"will refer to my colleague, the Minister for",16
NA,"Housing, the remarks the honorable gentle-",16
NA,man has put to me.,16
NA,NATIONAL SERVICE TRAINING.,16
Mr JESS ,Ha s the Minister for Labour,16
NA,and National Service seen reports,16
NA,quarters that national service training is,16
NA,having an effect on recruitment for the,16
NA,Citizen Military Forces? Could the Minister,16
NA,"reiterate the existing conditions, and any",16
NA,"variations to policy, whereby men may serve",16
NA,in the Citizen Military Forces instead of,16
NA,heing required to render national service?,16
Mr MCMAHON , I have seen reports,16
NA,over the last three to four months that,16
NA,young men who might otherwise be called,16
NA,up for national service training were apply-,16
NA,ing for membership of the Citizen Military,16
NA,Forces and being accepted. When they,16
NA,found that their birthdays were not drawn,16
NA,in the ballot they then resigned from marketing,16
NA,the Citizen Military Forces and were,16
NA,not subsequently called up for national serprovisions,16
NA,vice training. This matter has received,16
NA,"careful attention by my colleagues, the today.",16
NA,"Ministers for Defence, Army, Navy and",16
NA,Air and also by the Department of Labour,16
NA,"and National Service. I hope, with the",16
NA,"approval of the Leader of the Opposition,",16
NA,to make a short statement on the matter,16
NA,immediately after question time.,16
NA,CIVIL AVIATION.,16
Mr DAVIES , I preface a question to,16
NA,the Minister representing the Minister for,16
NA,Civil Aviation by reminding the Minister,16
NA,that the Duck River Co-operative Butter,16
NA,"Factory Co. Ltd. at Smithton, Tasmania,",16
NA,at present using three to four Trans-Austerms,16
NA,tralia Airlines DC3's per week to airlift Bill.,16
NA,"some 24,000 to 30,000 lb. of meat to Mel-",16
NA,"bourne from the Smithton aerodrome, and",16
NA,that a serious problem has arisen in that,16
NA,we have to accept the decision of the traffic,16
NA,controller at the Wynyard aerodrome before,16
NA,permission can be given for aircraft to land,16
NA,at Smithton. I ask the Minister: Is he aware,16
NA,that the weather patterns at Wynyard and,16
NA,Smithton can be the very opposite of one,16
NA,another because of the effect of the Sisters,16
NA,Hills between Wynyard and Smithton? In,16
NA,"view of the double handling, the loss of",16
NA,"bloom on the meat and increased costs, &c,",16
NA,involved when meat has to be taken back,16
NA,to the factory from the Smithton aerodrome,16
NA,because Wynyard has refused landing per-,16
NA,"mission, will the Minister give immediate",16
NA,and urgent consideration to either appoint-,16
NA,ing a departmental officer at Smithton or,16
NA,"authorizing the local agent of T.A.A., who",16
NA,"handles these aircraft, to advise regarding",16
NA,weather conditions at Smithton during this,16
NA,in some very busy meat export season?,16
Mr FAIRBAIRN ," Mr Speaker,",16
NA,naturally I am not aware of the facts that,16
NA,the honorable gentleman has given me in,16
NA,his question. I will see that these facts are,16
NA,passed on to the Minister for Civil Avia-,16
NA,tion in another place and that the request,16
NA,made by the honorable member is looked at.,16
NA,MARKETING OF DRIED FRUITS.,16
Mr TURNBULL , I ask the Attorney-,16
NA,General whether the present system of,16
NA,Australian dried fruits at home,16
NA,and abroad is definitely exempt from the,16
NA,"of the Trade Practices Bill 1965,",16
NA,which was passed by this House earlier,16
Mr SNEDDEN ,Th e system is not,16
NA,definitely exempted but provision is made,16
NA,in the Bill as it left this House for it to be,16
NA,exempted. The Government has had in,16
NA,mind that there are primary industry,16
NA,marketing organisations which should be,16
NA,so exempted. There is power in the Bill in,16
NA,this regard. As a matter of policy the Go-,16
NA,"vernment has looked at, for instance, the",16
NA,Australian Dried Fruits Association and the,16
NA,way it markets its products as a primary,16
NA,industry marketing organisation. I am con-,16
NA,is fident that it would be exempted under the,16
NA,of the regulations concerning the,16
NA,COAL.,17
Mr CONNOR ,Wil l the Minister for,17
NA,"National Development, at his coming con-",17
NA,ference with the New South Wales Minister,17
NA,"for Mines, discuss with that gentleman his",17
NA,statement of last May expressing concern,17
NA,at the possible exhaustion through present,17
NA,rates of consumption of New South Wales,17
NA,hard coking coal reserves by the year 2000?,17
NA,Will he also discuss with the New South,17
NA,Wales Minister for Mines the need for,17
NA,examining some controls over expanded,17
NA,"exports of such coal? In addition, will he",17
NA,ask the Minister for Mines that additional,17
NA,"reserves of such coal in New South Wales,",17
NA,"when located and proven, be preserved for",17
NA,the steel industry and other Australian,17
NA,consumers?,17
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,I t was because the,17
NA,Commonwealth Government did show,17
NA,some concern at the rate of depletion of,17
NA,coking coal supplies in New South Wales,17
NA,and Queensland that we got in touch with,17
NA,the Governments of those two States and,17
NA,arranged to hold the conference to which,17
NA,the honorable member referred. All we are,17
NA,seeking to do is to assess what these,17
NA,-reserves are. We know that at the present,17
NA,moment they are very considerable. Speak-,17
NA,"ing from memory, I think the known coal",17
NA,reserves in New South Wales are about,17
NA,"1,000 million tons. We believe that less",17
NA,half this quantity will be required by Aus-,17
NA,tralia to the end of this century. Neverthe-,17
NA,less we are anxious that a proper assess-,17
NA,ment of all the resources in New South,17
NA,Wales and Queensland should be made so,17
NA,"that, after this assessment has been made,",17
NA,the Government may be in a position to,17
NA,k ow the correct policy it should undertake.,17
NA,n,17
NA,QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE.,17
Sir KENT HUGHES , I ask,17
NA,the Prime Minister whether he is in a,17
NA,position yet to reply to two previous,17
NA,questions I asked regarding the Australian,17
NA,troops in Vietnam and about which the,17
NA,right honorable gentleman said he hoped,17
NA,to have the information last month.,17
Sir ROBERT MENZIES , I know that,17
NA,the honorable member has raised this,17
NA,matter quite a few times with me. As he,17
NA,"knows, this matter involves discussions in",17
NA,London. I am happy so say that in the,17
NA,case of the Borneo clasp for the General,17
NA,Service Medal 1962,17
NA,"Mr Whitlam - I rise to order, Mr.",17
NA,Speaker. I regret to have to take the same,17
NA,point of order as I took yesterday. There,17
NA,are questions on the notice paper to the,17
NA,right honorable gentleman concerning,17
NA,these matters. They have been there since,17
NA,9th November.,17
Mr SPEAKER ,I f there are questions,17
NA,on the notice paper in relation to this,17
NA,matter the honorable member's question is,17
NA,out of order.,17
Sir KENT HUGHES ," Mr Speaker,",17
NA,"I, too, rise to order. I asked my questions",17
NA,long before the Deputy Leader of the,17
NA,Opposition put his questions on the notice,17
NA,paper.,17
Mr SPEAKER ,I s the Prime Minister,17
NA,satisfied to answer the question?,17
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ," Mr Speaker,",17
NA,I am always satisfied to give a little,17
NA,information. The information is that Her,17
NA,Majesty has been pleased to approve the,17
NA,award of the General Service Medal 1962,17
NA,"with the clasp "" Borneo "" to Australian ser-",17
NA,vicemen in the area who qualify for tbe,17
NA,"award. The other case is that of Vietnam,",17
NA,and on this nofinalityhas yet been reached.,17
NA,It is being very actively pursued. I have had,17
NA,than messages about it in the last 24 hours. I,17
NA,hope to be able to make an announcement,17
NA,at an early date. When I have the informa-,17
NA,"tion, I will make the announcement",17
NA,promptly.,17
NA,SOCIAL SERVICES.,17
Mr MINOGUE ,M y question is,17
NA,addressed to the Minister for Social Services.,17
NA,Now that the Minister for Health has given,17
NA,a lead in removing the disparity between,17
NA,pensioners with respect to the medical,17
NA,"entitlement card, will the Minister for Social",17
NA,Services follow his example by granting the,17
NA,same rates of pension and supplementary,17
NA,assistance to married and single pensioners?,17
NA,Will he also remove the anomaly repre-,17
NA,sented by the payment of the additional,17
NA,funeral benefit to certain relatives of,17
NA,deceased pensioners and not to other rela-,17
NA,tives who have the same responsibility to,17
NA,see that deceased pensioners receive decent,17
NA,"burials, which now cost at least Â£100? Why",17
NA,is it that the Government persists in treating,17
NA,"pensioners on the basis of "" some chalk,",17
NA,"some cheese ""?",17
Mr SINCLAIR ,Th e extension of the,18
NA,pensioner medical service to all persons,18
NA,receiving pensions is another instance of the,18
NA,way in which this Government has extended,18
NA,social service benefits progressively to all,18
NA,sections of the community. The second part,18
NA,of the honorable member's question related,18
NA,to supplementary assistance. The increase of,18
NA,supplementary assistance announced by the,18
NA,Treasurer in his Budget speech was for the,18
NA,purpose of extending additional assistance,18
NA,"to single pensioners paying rent, who would",18
NA,seem to be the ones most affected by the,18
NA,cost situation in the community. It is felt,18
NA,that in the present situation single pen-,18
NA,sioners have a greater need than married,18
NA,pensioners. The distinction between single,18
NA,and married pensioners has been explained,18
NA,on a number of occasions in this House,18
NA,during discussions on suggestions for a stan-,18
NA,dard rate of pension. The practice of paying,18
NA,different amounts to single and married pen-,18
NA,sioners is customarily followed in every,18
NA,"country of the western world, on the basis",18
NA,that married people are able to share,18
NA,between them certain household expenses.,18
NA,The honorable member also referred to the,18
NA,extension of the funeral benefit. It is felt,18
NA,that pensioners should get the additional,18
NA,"advantage of the extended funeral benefit,",18
NA,and it is to this category of person that the,18
NA,funeral benefit has recently been extended.,18
NA,WOOL RESERVE PRICES PLAN.,18
Mr MAISEY , I direct a question to the,18
NA,Acting Minister for Primary Industry. to be used?,18
NA,Because of the widespread interest in the,18
NA,"wool reserve prices scheme referendum, vot-",18
NA,"ing in which will close tomorrow, can",18
NA,Minister say when the results of the ballot,18
NA,are likely to be known?,18
Mr ANTHONY ,Th e ballot will close,18
NA,at 12 noon tomorrow. The counting will,18
NA,start tomorrow afternoon. It is expected,18
NA,the tallies in the various States will be,18
NA,pleted by tomorrow night. They will be,18
NA,warded to the Chief Commonwealth Elecrocket,18
NA,"toral Officer in Canberra, who will add",18
NA,the results from the various States. It,18
NA,hoped that he will be able to give the results,18
NA,to the Minister on Friday and that the,18
NA,Minister will be able to announce them,18
NA,about noon on Friday.,18
NA,DROUGHT RELIEF.,18
Mr NELSON ,M y question is addressed,18
NA,to the Prime Minister. I refer to the agree-,18
NA,ment between the Commonwealth Govern-,18
NA,ment and the Governments of New South,18
NA,"Wales and Queensland on drought relief, as",18
NA,announced in the House yesterday. Will the,18
NA,Prime Minister extend to drought affected,18
NA,primary producers in the Northern Territory,18
NA,the same kind and level of assistance as the,18
NA,States are extending to their primary,18
NA,producers?,18
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ,Thi s is a,18
NA,matter which falls properly within the juris-,18
NA,diction of the Minister for Territories. It,18
NA,"was dealt with originally, as the honorable",18
NA,"member will recall, as a separate matter,",18
NA,with special arrangements being made be-,18
NA,cause we had a broad and direct responsi-,18
NA,bility in the Northern Territory. Should,18
NA,there be any further developments in this,18
NA,matter I am perfectly certain that the Minis-,18
NA,ter for Territories will be most willing to,18
NA,inform the House about them at the right,18
NA,time.,18
NA,REDSTONE ROCKETS.,18
Mr BRIDGESMAXWELL , I ask the,18
NA,Minister for Supply a question. I refer to a,18
NA,report that Redstone rockets from the United,18
NA,States of America are to be used for space,18
NA,experiments at Woomera. Is this correct?,18
NA,"Are these superseded rockets unsafe, as the",18
NA,"reports suggest, or are they suitable for the",18
NA,types of experiments to be carried out? Can,18
NA,the Minister tell the House anything about,18
NA,the experiments in which these rockets are,18
Mr FAIRHALL ,Fo r some time the,18
NA,the Department of Supply has been carrying,18
NA,on under a joint agreement with the United,18
NA,Kingdom experiments in what are known,18
NA,as re-entry physics to judge the technical,18
NA,phenomena that occur when a space,18
NA,vehicle re-enters the earth's atmosphere.,18
NA,These experiments have been conducted,18
NA,that with the Black Knight rocket. They have,18
NA,comnow reached a point at which it would per-,18
NA,forhaps be desirable to have a more powerful,18
NA,that would give greater height and,18
NA,up therefore greater speed of re-entry. For,18
NA,is some time there have been in progress,18
NA,negotiations for a tripartite arrangement,18
NA,"between the United Kingdom, Australia and",18
NA,by the United States of America. An agree-,18
NA,"ment has not yet been finalised, but if it",18
NA,should be it would provide for the use of,19
NA,"the Redstone rocket, which would be sup-",19
NA,plied by the United States. It is true that,19
NA,the Redstone rocket is obsolete for orbital,19
NA,"flight, for which it was once used, and as",19
NA,"an intercontinental ballistic missile, for",19
NA,which use it was designed. But in terms of,19
NA,the kind of experiment that we wish to,19
NA,undertake at Woomera it is not obsolete.,19
NA,There will be no safety problem since the,19
NA,rocket is not to be used for horizontal,19
NA,flight but will be used only for vertical,19
NA,"flight for which, apart from any other con-",19
NA,"siderations, it is completely safe. Further-",19
NA,"more, the safety precautions at the Woomera",19
NA,rocket range are very strict indeed. The,19
NA,honorable member may rest assured that if,19
NA,the projected agreement is arranged the,19
NA,programme will be carried through with,19
NA,safety and I am sure that it will be com-,19
NA,pleted with satisfaction.,19
NA,VIETNAM.,19
Mr UREN , I direct my question to the,19
NA,Minister for the Army. I ask: Has he,19
NA,inquired into the accusations made by the,19
NA,head of the Saigon bureau of the United,19
NA,"States magazine "" Newsweek "" that an Aus-",19
NA,tralian adviser serving with the South,19
NA,namese forces had advised a Vietnamese,19
NA,officer to shoot a Vietcong suspect? If the,19
NA,Minister has made an inquiry will he say,19
NA,whether the facts are as published in,19
NA,""" Newsweek "" and will he give to the House",19
NA,details of the inquiry?,19
Dr FORBES ,A s I said at the time that,19
NA,"the article appeared, I am in the course of",19
NA,investigating this matter. The delay in the,19
NA,inquiry has been due to thc fact that the,19
NA,article does not identify the time and place,19
NA,and does not name the individual concerned.,19
NA,"Secondly, delay has been caused because",19
NA,"the author of the article, whose name is",19
NA,"Tuohy, has been absent from Saigon. How-",19
NA,"ever, on 4th December he attended a meet-",19
NA,ing with the commander of the Australian,19
NA,Army forces in Vietnam at the commander's,19
NA,request. At that meeting the commander,19
NA,asked the correspondent some questions,19
NA,about the article. He asked first whether,19
NA,gave afirst-handaccount and whether the,19
NA,correspondent had seen the incident. To,19
NA,"this question he replied: "" No"". He was",19
NA,asked whether he believed the report to,19
NA,"be true. He said: "" Yes "". He admitted,",19
NA,"ever, that the story might have become",19
NA,somewhat blurred as a consequence of,19
NA,passing through quite a number of hands,19
NA,and admitted that it probably went through,19
NA,quite a number of hands. He was told by,19
NA,the commander that this was a matter of,19
NA,"great moment to us in Australia, that it",19
NA,represented a slur on the good name of,19
NA,"Australian soldiers, that such behaviour as",19
NA,that alleged was contrary to everything that,19
NA,they had been taught in their training and,19
NA,everything that they had been brought up,19
NA,to believe in as soldiers and that the cor-,19
NA,respondent therefore had an obligation to,19
NA,name the soldier concerned. The corre-,19
NA,spondent was told that this was a matter,19
NA,much bigger than just the possible conse-,19
NA,qeunces for one individual. So far he has,19
NA,"refused to name the soldier, but is consider-",19
NA,ing his position. Until this is done I can,19
NA,take the matter no further.,19
NA,MINING.,19
Dr GIBBS ,Ha s the Minister for,19
NA,National Development seen a report that,19
NA,a new silver-lead-zinc lode in the Northern,19
NA,Territory is to be worked by an Australian,19
NA,company? Is this report true? Will the,19
NA,honorable gentleman tell the House how,19
NA,Vietmany mineral discoveries have been,19
NA,brought into production or earmarked for,19
NA,production in the last 12 months? Are new,19
NA,mineral discoveries likely to make a,19
NA,significant contribution to export income in,19
NA,the foreseeable future?,19
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Th e silver-lead-zinc,19
NA,mine to which I think the honorable gentle-,19
NA,"man refers, and which is to be mined by",19
NA,"United Uranium, is not a new mine; it is one",19
NA,which was originally mined about 20 years,19
NA,ago and the high quality ore was taken out.,19
NA,It has now been drilled and deposits have,19
NA,proved to be fairly extensive. I understand,19
NA,that some of the lower quality ore is about,19
NA,"to be mined. However, this is not one of",19
NA,"the very large discoveries. I am afraid, as",19
NA,"the honorable gentleman realises, that it is",19
NA,"quite impossible for me to detail, in",19
NA,"answer to a question without notice, all the",19
NA,discoveries that have occurred in Australia,19
NA,"it during thc last 12 months, because we are",19
NA,going through a second period of discovery,19
NA,which probably exceeds the discoveries of,19
NA,the gold rush. If the honorable,19
NA,gentleman puts the question on the,19
NA,hownotice paper I will see that he gets a,19
NA,"full reply. I can tell him, however, that",19
NA,minerals look like playing a very impor-,20
NA,tant part in contributing to Australia's ex-,20
NA,"port income. This year, Â£120 million worth",20
NA,"of minerals were exported, and the Bureau",20
NA,of Mineral Resources has estimated that in,20
NA,five years' time the value of our exports,20
NA,of minerals will have risen to Â£280 million,20
NA,per annum.,20
NA,SCHOOL CADETS.,20
Mr STEWART , I address a question to,20
NA,the Minister for the Army. Is it a fact that,20
NA,school cadet units are expected to attend,20
NA,week-end bivouacs and two-week camps,20
NA,during summer months? Is it also a fact that,20
NA,thc issue of summer trousers to school,20
NA,cadets has been reduced from two pairs to,20
NA,"one pair? If so, what are the reasons for",20
NA,this pinch penny decision and who is,20
NA,responsible for it? Do Army authorities,20
NA,expect school cadets to wear the one pair,20
NA,of trousers for the duration of the bivouacs,20
NA,"and camps? If not, what arrangements is a",20
NA,school cadet expected to make to protect his,20
NA,modesty while his sole pair of trousers is,20
NA,"being laundered? Finally, is there any truth",20
NA,in the rumour that a member of the Pacific,20
NA,Islands Regiment is to be asked to demon-,20
NA,strate to school cadets the correct way to,20
NA,don their privately supplied lap-laps?,20
Dr FORBES , I am not aware of the,20
NA,position described by the honorable gentle-,20
NA,man. 1 shall investigate and find out what,20
NA,the situation is. Perhaps I should say at,20
NA,"stage that school cadets, like members of the",20
NA,"Services going into camp, would doubtless",20
NA,be issued with working dress while in,20
NA,camp as part of a camp issue. This would,20
NA,"undoubtedly reduce the strain, even on fhe",20
NA,"one pair of trousers, if that is all that",20
NA,"have. However, I shall investigate the posi-",20
NA,tion and let the honorable gentleman know,20
NA,the result of my inquiries.,20
NA,DROUGHT RELIEF.,20
Mr IAN ALLAN ,Ca n the Treasurer,20
NA,give an assurance that the needs of those,20
NA,primary producers in drought affected areas,20
NA,who have not exhausted their capital or,20
NA,capacity to borrow and who will thus be,20
NA,excluded from the benefits announced by,20
NA,the Prime Minister yesterday will be,20
NA,considered by the Government?,20
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,"Representation s and,",20
NA,on this aspect have come from honorable Government policy?,20
NA,"members in various parts of the House,",20
NA,including the honorable gentleman himself,20
NA,on earlier occasions. I can assure him that,20
NA,the situation of those who fall within this,20
NA,category is well recognised by the Govern-,20
NA,ment and consideration is being given to,20
NA,ways and means by which they can be,20
NA,assisted with their problem.,20
NA,PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL,20
NA,BENEFITS.,20
Mr CALWELL , I ask the Minister for,20
NA,Social Services: Is it a fact that the means,20
NA,test with regard to pharmaceutical and,20
NA,medical benefits as applied to pensioners,20
NA,was imposed by the present Government on,20
NA,lst November 1955? Is it also a fact that,20
NA,during the 10-year period that has elapsed,20
NA,since then the Opposition has repeatedly,20
NA,moved amendments seeking the abolition of,20
NA,"the means test, without having once re-",20
NA,ceived any support from any one Govern-,20
NA,ment member? Is it also a fact that not one,20
NA,Government member has ever spoken in,20
NA,protest against the operation of the means,20
NA,test on pensioners in the past 10 years?,20
Dr MACKAY ,"Loo k up "" Hansard "".",20
Mr SINCLAIR ,A s the honorable,20
NA,"member for Evans has just said, the answer",20
NA,to the last part of the question asked by,20
NA,the Leader of the Opposition is to be found,20
NA,"in "" Hansard "". Many members on the Go-",20
NA,this vernment side have frequently advocated,20
NA,the liberalisation of the means test and the,20
NA,extension of the pensioner medical service,20
NA,to all persons in receipt of pension benefits.,20
NA,The notable extension this year was made,20
NA,in accordance with this principle. Because,20
NA,"they of that extension, after lst January next",20
NA,many people will be in a considerably,20
NA,better position with regard to medical and,20
NA,pharmaceutical benefits than they were,20
NA,previously.,20
NA,AUTOMATION.,20
Mr FALKINDER , I address a question,20
NA,to the Minister for Labour and National,20
NA,Service. What steps of a major kind are,20
NA,being taken by the Government or his,20
NA,Department to study automation? Is a con-,20
NA,tinuing evaluation being made of the effects,20
NA,of the progressive automation of industry,20
NA,"in particular, of the effect on future",20
Mr MCMAHON , Several major,21
NA,methods are adopted by the Government to,21
NA,ensure that automation will not have a sub-,21
NA,stantial and immediate impact on the em-,21
NA,"ployment of people. For example, produc-",21
NA,tivity groups have been established on a,21
NA,"wide scale. I think more than 2,000 firms",21
NA,are now involved in them. These groups con-,21
NA,tinually watch not only the distribution of,21
NA,information between industries and com-,21
NA,panies but also the impact of automation on,21
NA,their own industries and the likely impact,21
NA,on associated industries. The honorable,21
NA,"gentleman would know, too, that the former",21
NA,Ministry of Labour Advisory Council pub-,21
NA,lished a pamphlet on the effect of automa-,21
NA,tion. I think it is one of the standard works,21
NA,on the subject. 1 shall obtain a copy and,21
NA,let the honorable gentleman have it.,21
NA,"As to the last part of the question, one",21
NA,section of my Department continually,21
NA,watches the impact of automation and the,21
NA,effect it is likely to have upon the growth,21
NA,"of the work force, upon unemployment and",21
NA,upon the Commonwealth Public Service.,21
NA,The honorable gentleman can take it that,21
NA,the matter is continually under observation,21
NA,by us. I shall obtain some further informa-,21
NA,tion and let him have it.,21
NA,SEAMEN'S AWARD.,21
Mr BENSON , I address to the Minister,21
NA,for Labour and National Service a question,21
NA,relating to working conditions for seamen.,21
NA,The Minister will be aware of the interest of,21
NA,all members in any measures designed to,21
NA,bring about better working conditions and,21
NA,continuity of work for seamen. He will recall,21
NA,that some months ago the 195S seamen's,21
NA,award was varied to provide for a stabilisa-,21
NA,tion scheme. I ask: Is the Minister able to,21
NA,advise whether continuity of work is being,21
NA,achieved? Can be tell us the amount of,21
NA,attendance money paid so far to this,21
NA,"industry? Finally, can he say whether all",21
NA,labour quotas have been resolved?,21
Mr MCMAHON ,Th e honorable mem-,21
NA,"ber will have, of course, a very deep and",21
NA,detailed knowledge of the effects of stabilisa-,21
NA,"tion and mechanisation schemes because, if",21
NA,"my memory holds good, he was the first",21
NA,chairman of a mechanisation committee,21
NA,appointed on the Australian waterfront to,21
NA,look at the problems of the mechanisation,21
NA,of the sugar industry as they applied to,21
NA,"seamen, waterside workers and stevedores.",21
NA,About 16 months ago an agreement was,21
NA,made between the steamship owners and,21
NA,the Seamen's Union of Australia. This was,21
NA,supervised by my own Department and by,21
NA,the Department of Shipping and Transport.,21
NA,As a result of that agreement considerable,21
NA,improvements in pay and working condi-,21
NA,tions of seamen were arrived at in return for,21
NA,which the seamen agreed to stabilise the,21
NA,industry to give continuity of work and to,21
NA,get a better turnround time for ships. In,21
NA,addition the exclusive right of recruitment,21
NA,was taken away from the Seamen's Union.,21
NA,These provisions were finally embodied in an,21
NA,amendment to the award of 1955.,21
NA,From time to time a report is made by my,21
NA,Department and by the Department of,21
NA,Shipping and Transport showing how the,21
NA,conditions agreed to had been observed. I,21
NA,am glad to be able to inform the honorable,21
NA,member that there has been a substantial,21
NA,reduction in the number of days lost in,21
NA,the shipping industry. There were consider-,21
NA,able reductions in the first two four-monthly,21
NA,periods; in the first there was a loss of,21
NA,"576 days, involving about 107 ships; and",21
NA,in the last four monthly period there have,21
NA,"been almost no losses at all, or the loss has",21
NA,been so negligible that it has not been,21
NA,worth while reporting upon. There has been,21
NA,a considerable improvement in the industry.,21
NA,For the moment it appears to be stabilised.,21
NA,"As to the second question, concerning",21
NA,"attendance money, I think the amount paid",21
NA,since 1st December 1964 is about,21
NA,"Â£33,000 already, but that is a small",21
NA,amount compared to the reduction in,21
NA,stoppages that has taken place. As to,21
NA,the last question relating to quotas for sea-,21
NA,"men, regrettably the steamship owners have",21
NA,not put up proposals to the Seamen's Union.,21
NA,This matter will be brought to the attention,21
NA,of the presidential member of the Concilia-,21
NA,tion and Arbitration Commission and I hope,21
NA,"that he, in his turn, will bring it to the",21
NA,attention of the parties.,21
NA,PENSIONER MEDICAL SERVICE.,21
Mr BUCHANAN ,M y question to the,21
NA,Minister for Health relates to the payments,21
NA,made to doctors under the pensioner medical,21
NA,service. The present arrangement is for,21
NA,payment of 16s. for each visit to a doctor's,21
NA,surgery and Â£1 for each home visit a doctor,21
NA,"makes to a pensioner, even when pensioners",21
NA,are grouped together in an aged persons,21
NA,home. No payment is made for the time a,22
NA,doctor spends treating pensioners in hos-,22
NA,pitals. Will the Minister examine the position,22
NA,to see whether this is an anomaly?,22
Mr SWARTZ ,Wit h the exception of,22
NA,the Commonwealth Territories the admin-,22
NA,istration of hospitals comes within the con-,22
NA,"trol of the State Governments. However, it",22
NA,is a fact that the honorary system of ser-,22
NA,vice by doctors applies in all States of,22
NA,Australia with one exception-Wester n,22
NA,Australia. It is a fact also that the medical,22
NA,profession provides services on an honorary,22
NA,basis generally in practically every case,22
NA,where the pensioner or patient is in a public,22
NA,ward. That service still continues. It was,22
NA,discussed at the last conference of the Aus-,22
NA,tralian Medical Association when the,22
NA,decision was made to continue the system.,22
NA,COMMONWEALTH,22
NA,SUPERANNUATION FUND.,22
Mr COSTA , I address a question,22
NA,Treasurer concerning recent legislation,22
NA,affecting the distribution of the Â£5.6 million,22
NA,surplus in the Commonwealth Superbered,22
NA,annuation Fund. Has the Treasurer decided,22
NA,on any order of priority for the distribution?,22
NA,"If not, will he consider giving preference",22
NA,"in priority to the oldest pensioners, because",22
NA,some who were expecting to receive refunds,22
NA,at this time last year have since died?,22
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Earlie r in the,22
NA,session I indicated that as we were not,22
NA,to provide for the full distribution of the,22
NA,surplus owing to the delay in actuarial calsider,22
NA,"culations, consideration had been given",22
NA,an interim distribution. In making that,22
NA,"interim distribution, I understand, the",22
NA,category of pensioner to which the honorwe,22
NA,able gentleman has referred will be,22
NA,priority. I regret that I am not able to give Rhodesia.,22
NA,the precise date on which the distribution,22
NA,will be made. I assure the honorable mem-,22
NA,ber that everything possible is being done,22
NA,"expedite the matter. If, upon inquiry, I",22
NA,that my understanding of the situation,22
NA,"not correet, I will let the honorable gentlethe",22
NA,man know the true position.,22
NA,RHODESIA.,22
NA,Ministerial Statement,22
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ,Kooyong-,22
NA,Prime Minister) -b y leave- 1 wish to,22
NA,inform the House of measures in the,22
NA,financial and economic field which the,22
NA,Government has decided to take against,22
NA,the illegal administration in Rhodesia. These,22
NA,measures are additional to those that I,22
NA,announced on 16th November. They are,22
NA,taken in the belief that peaceful measures,22
NA,"are preferable to military measures and that,",22
NA,in order to minimise the ultimate damage to,22
NA,"Rhodesia, the sooner the sanctions become",22
NA,effective and normal constitutional admin-,22
NA,"istration is resumed, the better for that",22
NA,country.,22
NA,This is not an easy decision to take,22
NA,because sanctions can hurt very deeply. Of,22
NA,"course, sanctions are designed to impose",22
NA,"disabilities, but a system of sanctions which",22
NA,stops short of being effective could easily,22
NA,"go on operating for a long, long time,",22
NA,"creating irritations, not solving the problem",22
NA,"and, perhaps, provoking extreme action on",22
NA,the part of other people. Therefore we have,22
NA,"come to the conclusion that, falling in line",22
NA,with the United Kingdom and various other,22
NA,"to the countries, we should to some extent",22
NA,intensify our economic measures. In what,22
NA,"1 say it must always, of course, be remem-",22
NA,that our trade with Rhodesia is a,22
NA,small one-no t quite Â£2 million worth of,22
NA,imports altogether annually.,22
NA,"In relation tofinancialmeasures, we will",22
NA,recognise the Board of the Reserve Bank,22
NA,"of Rhodesia, which the British Govern-",22
NA,ment has appointed to replace the previous,22
NA,board. We will recognise it as the only,22
NA,able proper authority. Following from this,22
NA,"decision, it may be necessary for us to con-",22
NA,introducing restrictions in respect of,22
NA,to financial transactions between Australia,22
NA,and Rhodesian residents comparable with,22
NA,"the restrictions introduced by Britain. Also,",22
NA,have decided to suspend the money,22
NA,given order service between Australia and,22
NA,"In relation to economic measures, it will",22
NA,to be recalled that we have already placed a,22
NA,find ban on the importation of tobacco from,22
NA,is Rhodesia. We now propose to prohibit also,22
NA,"importation of ferro-alloys, chrome ore",22
NA,and asbestos. The ban on imports of,22
NA,tobacco meant that approximately three-,22
NA,quarters of our total imports from,22
NA,Rhodesia were suspended. The inclusion of,22
NA,"ferro-alloys, chrome pre and asbestos will",22
NA,mean that we have prohibited imports from,22
NA,"Rhodesia affecting more than 90 per cent,",22
NA,of the total. The British have banned,22
NA,"approximately 95 per cent, of their imports",23
NA,from Rhodesia.,23
NA,"Honorable members will, of course,",23
NA,recognise that in a relatively small field,23
NA,"these measures are severe. However, the",23
NA,unhappy situation with which we are deal-,23
NA,"ing is of grave proportions, involving as it",23
NA,"does, not only the cessation of lawful rule",23
NA,"in Rhodesia, but also the arousing of",23
NA,emotions in Africa and elsewhere. In all,23
NA,these matters it is our hope that the result,23
NA,"of the measures now being applied, by this",23
NA,and other countries will mean a return to,23
NA,sanity and negotiation and that Rhodesia,23
NA,will see reason and find a return to a legal,23
NA,and constructive relationship with the,23
NA,British Government.,23

Mr MCMAHON ,Lowe-Ministe r for,23
NA,Labour and National Service) -b y leave-,23
NA,"In November of last year, I introduced",23
NA,legislation providing for the re-introduction,23
NA,of national service. I said then that the Go-,23
NA,vernment intended using the national service,23
NA,scheme as a means of encouraging men,23
NA,enlist in the Citizen Military Forces.,23
NA,"The roles of the Citizen Military Forces,",23
NA,the Citizen Naval Forces and the Citizen,23
NA,Air Force are of great importance in our,23
NA,defence plans. Thus it was provided that spective,23
NA,men liable to render national service who,23
NA,were ballotted in would be granted provided,23
NA,indefinite deferment of call up if they,23
NA,"were, at the time of the ballot, members",23
NA,"the Citizen Naval Forces, Citizen Military",23
NA,Forces or active Citizen Air Force. The,23
NA,indefinite deferment was contingent upon,23
NA,men serving efficiently for a total period,23
NA,five years if they had completed at least,23
NA,one year's efficient service at the time,23
NA,"the ballot, or for a total of six years if they",23
NA,had completed less than one year's efficient,23
NA,service at the time of the ballot. Those,23
NA,were not members of the Citizen Forces at,23
NA,the time of their registration were required,23
NA,to join those Forces before the ballot if,23
NA,they wished to be eligible for deferment,23
NA,under these provisions. These arrangements,23
NA,will continue to apply to members of the,23
NA,Citizen Forces who have already been,23
NA,granted indefinite deferment of call up.,23
NA,These particular deferment provisions,23
NA,have now been reviewed and as from next,23
NA,year men who register for national service,23
NA,may be permitted to serve in the Citizen,23
NA,"Forces, provided they are acceptable to the",23
NA,"Citizen Forces, and that there are suitable",23
NA,"vacancies for them, instead of being re-",23
NA,quired to perform national service. Those,23
NA,who wish to follow this course will be re-,23
NA,quired to give an undertaking to do so,23
NA,before the ballot relating to the registration,23
NA,of their age group. They may fali within,23
NA,any one of three categories.,23
NA,"First, there will be those who have served",23
NA,efficiently as members of the Citizen Forces,23
NA,for at least 12 months at the date of,23
NA,commencement of registration of their age,23
NA,group. They will be required to undertake,23
NA,to serve efficiently in the Citizen Forces for,23
NA,a total period of five years. If they are,23
NA,ballotted in they will not be called up for,23
NA,national service provided they serve,23
NA,efficiently for that period; if ballotted out,23
NA,"they will not, under present arrangements,",23
NA,be called up for national service in the,23
NA,Citizen Forces under the normal conditions,23
NA,relating to such service.,23
NA,"Secondly, there will be those who have",23
NA,served efficiently as members of the Citizen,23
NA,to Forces for less than 12 months at the,23
NA,date of commencement of registration for,23
NA,their age group. They will be required to,23

NA,of the result of the ballot. They will,23
NA,be granted indefinite deferment of call up,23
NA,they serve efficiently for the total,23
NA,period; those who fail to serve efficiently,23
NA,of for the full period will become liable for,23
NA,"call up for national service, regardless of",23
NA,whether they were or were not ballotted in.,23
NA,"Thirdly, there will be those who are not",23

NA,who to complete a total of six years' efficient,23
NA,"service with the Citizen Forces, irrespective",23
NA,"of the result of the ballot, if they are",23
NA,accepted as members. For the undertaking,24
NA,to be effective they must apply to join the,24
NA,"Citizen Forces, before they complete the",24
NA,"undertaking, and be accepted as members.",24
NA,They will be granted indefinite deferment,24
NA,of call-up provided they serve efficiently for,24

NA,sign a form of undertaking and forward,24
NA,it to my Department within 14 days of the,24

NA,These arrangements will apply to the,24

Mr CLEAVER ,"Thes e reports relate,",24
NA,"respectively, to expenditure from the",24
NA,Advance to the Treasurer and to other ex-,24
NA,penditure from the Consolidated Revenue,24
NA,Fund in 1964-65. The question fore-,24
NA,shadowed in your Committee's Sixtieth,24
NA,"Report, of the desirability of conducting one",24
NA,or two inquiries into these matters and,24
NA,involving one or two reports did not arise,24
NA,in respect of the financial year 1962-63 as,24
NA,the limited time available to your Commit-,24
NA,tee precluded the completion of one large,24
NA,comprehensive report; nor did it arise in,24
NA,respect of the financial year 1963-64 as your,24
NA,Committee confined its inquiry in respect of,24
NA,the financial results for that year to an,24
NA,are examination of expenditure from the,24
NA,at the Advance to the Treasurer.,24
NA,In approaching its inquiry into the Con-,24
NA,"solidated Revenue Fund results for 1964-65,",24
NA,your Committee considered that as several,24
NA,departments would be involved in respect of,24
NA,expenditure from the Advance to the,24
NA,Treasurer and other expenditure from the,24
NA,"these Consolidated Revenue Fund, considerable",24
NA,economy of time would be achieved if a,24
NA,"single inquiry were to be held but that,",24
NA,as the subject matter relating to the two,24
NA,"matters was clearly distinguishable, two",24
NA,reports should be submitted to the,24
NA,In its previous report relating to expen-,24
NA,diture from the Advance to the Treasurer,24
NA,8th in 1963-64 your Committee drew attention,24
NA,to the unsatisfactory nature of some of the,24
NA,explanatory statements submitted by depart-,24
NA,ments and indicated that discussions would,24
NA,take place between officers of the Depart-,24
NA,ment of the Treasury and the Committee to,24
NA,produce a suitable pro forma statement for,24
NA,use by departments in connection with the,24
NA,inquiry in 1964-65. Your Committee's,24
NA,Reports. examination of the explanatory statements,24
NA,submitted by departments this year and based,24
NA,on the pro forma statement which was duly,24
NA,developed showed a very substantial im-,24
NA,provement in the quality of the explanations,24
NA,from,24
NA,"Act submitted. At the same time, experience in",24
NA,the use of the pro forma statement showed,24
NA,a need for further refinement and your,25
NA,Committee is desirous that further dis-,25
NA,cussions occur between it and represen-,25
NA,tatives of the Treasury in this refining,25
NA,process. During the preparation of the,25
NA,pro forma statement for use in connection,25
NA,with expenditure from the Advance to the,25
NA,"Treasurer, your Committee developed an",25
NA,additional pro forma for use in the exam-,25
NA,ination of items of expenditure where over-,25
NA,estimating had occurred. The use of this,25
NA,pro forma by departments provided us with,25
NA,information on a uniform basis and in each,25
NA,case showed the history of estimating and,25
NA,expenditure for a period of three years.,25
NA,As the Seventy-fourth and Seventy-fifth,25
NA,"Reports show, your Committee discovered,",25
NA,"during the course of its inquiry, several",25
NA,instances in which errors had occurred and,25
NA,had not been detected in time for their,25
NA,correction to be effected in the Additional,25
NA,Estimates. Your Committee has commented,25
NA,appropriately on such circumstances where,25
NA,they have occurred and we believe that they,25
NA,reflect adversely on the departments con-,25
NA,"cerned. The inquiry also showed that, as",25
NA,"in previous years, there were explanations",25
NA,"for variations from the estimate, which, due",25
NA,"to unforeseen circumstances, are acceptable.",25
NA,"The inquiry also revealed, however, ex-",25
NA,amples of unsatisfactory estimating where,25
NA,over-confident expectations had not been,25
NA,borne out in reality.,25
NA,As in some cases the evidence submitted,25
NA,disclosed a lack of appreciation of the con-,25
NA,siderations which should be taken into,25
NA,account by departments in the formulation,25
NA,"of their estimates, your Committee has again",25
NA,enunciated in both the Seventy-fourth and,25
NA,"Seventy-fifth Reports, the following prin-",25
NA,ciples for departmental guidance-,25

NA,the following proposed work-,25
NA,"Erection of Commonwealth Offices, Perth,",25
NA,Western Australia.,25
NA,I ask for leave to make a short statement,25
NA,in connection with the report.,25
Mr SPEAKER ,Ther e being no objec-,25

Mr BRIMBLECOMBE ,Th e first com-,25
NA,ment I should like to make in connection,25
NA,with this report is to emphasise the need,25
NA,for the speedy completion of this building.,25
NA,Relief is urgently required from the sub-,25
NA,standard and overcrowded conditions under,25
NA,which the staff of some Commonwealth,25
NA,"offices in Perth, such as the Taxation",25
NA,"Branch, are at present working. The Bureau",25
NA,of Census and Statistics is installing a Con-,25
NA,trol Data 3200 Computer in Perth. This is,25
NA,an expensive piece of equipment and unfor-,25
NA,tunately it is to be located in rented space,25
NA,"because there is, at this point of time, no",25
NA,suitable accommodation available in a Com-,25
NA,monwealth owned building. There is a,25
NA,pressing requirement for new accommoda-,25
NA,tion for the computer because the rented,25
NA,space will be too small in about thee years,25
NA,time to accommodate the expanding needs,25
NA,of the working units located adjacent to,25
NA,the computer.,25
NA,There have been suggestions in the Perth,25
NA,Press in recent weeks that public money is,25
NA,being wasted by the construction of build-,25
NA,ings such as that proposed in this reference.,25
NA,The Commonwealth Offices are to be,25
NA,finished in quality materials chosen for their,25
NA,durability and ease of maintenance and are,25
NA,to be air conditioned for the comfort of,25
NA,the staff and the public who use them.,25
NA,On this particular point it might be noted,25
NA,that the computer requires space that is air-,26
NA,conditioned on a 24-hour day basis within,26
NA,fine tolerances of humidity and temperature,26
NA,control.,26
NA,"The cost of the building is about Â£1,000",26
NA,per square including about Â£200 per square,26
NA,for air conditioning. The Committeee does,26
NA,not consider that at this figure the cost is,26
NA,excessive or that public money is being,26
NA,wasted. For the price the Commonwealth,26
NA,will be obtaining a good quality building,26
NA,"which will provide comfortable, but not",26
NA,"lavish, conditions for the staff and the pub-",26
NA,"lic who will use it. Furthermore, this will be",26
NA,a building which will survive the passage,26
NA,of time better than most and of which the,26
NA,Commonwealth and the city of Perth will,26
NA,be proud.,26

NA,Army and Minister Assisting the Treasurer),26
NA,[3.37] - I move-,26
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,26
NA,The purpose of this Bill is to obtain,26
NA,approval of Parliament to an agreement,26
NA,between the Commonwealth and the State,26
NA,of Queensland for the provision of financial,26
NA,assistance to the State for harbour works,26
NA,at Weipa in North Queensland. The Comand,26
NA,monwealth Government's decision in this,26
NA,matter was announced in the last Budget,26
NA,the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) when he,26
NA,said that the Commonwealth would provide,26
NA,a loan to the State up to a maximum of,26
NA,"Â£1,635,000 to finance these works. He also",26
NA,"indicated that an amount of Â£750,000 had",26
NA,been provided in the current year's Estimates,26
NA,for this purpose. Agreement has now been,26
NA,reached between the Commonwealth and the,26
NA,State on the conditions on which this assis-,26
NA,"tance is to be provided, and the text of the",26
NA,agreement is set out in the schedule to the,26
NA,Bill.,26
NA,Before I explain the agreement I should,26
NA,like to give the House some general back-,26
NA,"ground to the development of Weipa,",26
NA,which is situated in a remote corner of north,26
NA,Queensland on the western side of Cape,26
NA,York Peninsula. The potential of the bauxite,26
NA,deposits at Weipa wasfirstrecognised by the,26
NA,Chief Geologist of Consolidated Zinc Pty.,26
NA,"Ltd. in 1955, and in 1957 a company known",26
NA,as Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation,26
NA,I Ltd -generall y abbreviated to Comalco-,26
NA,was formed to develop the port and to mine,26
NA,bauxite from a lease of an area of about,26
NA,"t of 2,380 square miles. Undertakings to this",26
NA,effect were entered into by Comalco in an,26
NA,agreement with the Queensland Government.,26
NA,In accordance with its undertakings Comalco,26
NA,"dredged an access channel in Albatross Bay,",26
NA,a built a combined export-import berth and,26
NA,established a small mining township at,26
NA,"Weipa. Mining, beneficiating and ship load-",26
NA,ing facilities were constructed and the,26
NA,has at present a capacity to,26
NA,"handle about 700,000 tons of bauxite",26
NA,per year.,26
NA,An expansion is under way to increase,26
NA,"BILL 1965. the capacity of the undertaking to 2,500,000",26
NA,tons of bauxite each year. About one half,26
NA,of this production will be shipped to Glad-,26
NA,stone for processing into alumina at the,26
NA,refinery being constructed at that centre by,26
NA,Queensland Alumina Ltd. The rest of the,26
NA,production is expected to be exported to,26
NA,"Japan, Germany, France and South",26
NA,America. In recognition of the importance,26
NA,"the of Weipa the Queensland Govemment, in",26
NA,addition to assuming control of the harbour,26
NA,and purchasing the existing harbour works,26
NA,"constructed by Comalco, has undertaken",26
NA,to deepen the channel and to provide new,26
NA,improved wharves. I am informed that,26
NA,this work will need to be completed by 31st,26
NA,"by December 1966, in order to fit in with ex-",26
NA,pansion of the Weipa bauxite undertaking,26
NA,and the timetable for construction of the,27
NA,alumina refinery at Gladstone.,27
NA,The Queensland Government requested,27
NA,the Commonwealth some time ago to pro-,27
NA,vide nnancial assistance for harbour works,27
NA,at Weipa and Gladstone. After careful con-,27
NA,sideration the Commonwealth Government,27
NA,"decided that assistance of up to Â£1,635,000,",27
NA,"on a repayable interest-bearing loan basis,",27
NA,would be offered to the State for the har-,27
NA,bour works at Weipa which the State had,27
NA,agreed to carry out. The State Government,27
NA,"accepted the Commonwealth's offer, and the",27
NA,Bill before the House seeks Parliament's,27
NA,approval of the provision of assistance,27
NA,accordingly. The terms on which the Com-,27
NA,monwealthfinancialassistance is to be pro-,27
NA,vided are set out in the agreement. The,27
NA,agreement provides for payments to the,27
NA,State in respect of expenditure on the har-,27
NA,"bour works after lst July 1965. Interest,",27
NA,at the effective long term Commonwealth,27
NA,"bond rate, will be capitalised during the",27
NA,period of construction. Repayments will be,27
NA,"spread over a period of 30 years, commenc-",27
NA,ing on 15th July 1967 and will be made,27
NA,on the credit foncier basis of equal instal-,27
NA,ments of principal and interest combined.,27
NA,The harbour works towards which the Com-,27
NA,monwealth loan will be applied are specified,27
NA,in the schedule to the agreement. These,27
NA,works consist of the deepening of the exist-,27
NA,"ing access channel, the building of a wharf",27
NA,"for the export of bauxite into bulk carriers,",27
NA,and improvements and additions to the,27
NA,existing general cargo wharf.,27
NA,The agreement also contains the usual,27
NA,provisions included in agreements of this,27
NA,nature relating to such things as the efficient,27
NA,"execution of the works, the payment to the",27
NA,"State of working advances, the supply of",27
NA,information by the State and the auditing,27
NA,of expenditure. There is also a provision,27
NA,allowing for the variation of the harbour,27
NA,works specified in the schedule to the ex-,27
NA,tent proposed by the State and approved,27
NA,by the Treasurer in the interests of more,27
NA,efficient fulfilment of the objectives of the,27
NA,"Agreement. In conclusion, I would like to",27
NA,say that the Governnient is pleased to be,27
NA,"associated with the project, which will un-",27
NA,doubtedly make a major contribution not,27
NA,only to the development of an important,27
NA,new industry but also to the development,27
NA,of a particularly remote northern corner of,27
NA,our vast continent. I commend the Bill to,27
NA,the House.,27

NA,"(vide page 3191), on motion by Mr Harold",27
NA,Holt-,27
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,27
Mr CREAN ,Melbourne Ports) [3.44].,27
NA,- I wish to indicate at the start that whilst,27
NA,the Opposition agrees with the material in,27
NA,this Bill it intends in the committee stage,27
NA,to move an amendment the purpose of,27
NA,which will be to exempt from the payment,27
NA,of payroll tax municipal or other local,27
NA,governing bodies or an authority established,27
NA,for the purpose of carrying out all or any,27
NA,of the functions ordinarily carried out by,27
NA,such a body otherwise than in the conduct,27
NA,of an enterprise which in the opinion of,27
NA,the Commissioner is a trading enterprise. I,27
NA,shall outline the purpose of the amendment,27
NA,later but I wish to indicate that it is the,27
NA,Opposition's intention to move that amend-,27
NA,ment in the committee stage when we are,27
NA,dealing with clause 3. The Bill amends the,27
NA,Pay-Roll Tax Assessment Act to facilitate,27
NA,the application of a rebate system in,27
NA,connection with the pay-roll tax which,27
NA,applies when certain firms increase the,27
NA,volume of goods they are producing which,27
NA,are sold overseas. This sort of measure is,27
NA,necessary apparently because of the com-,27
NA,mitments which Australia has to such,27
NA,bodies as the General Agreement on Tariffs,27
NA,and Trade which provides that the member,27
NA,countries shall not discriminate in their,27
NA,taxing laws so as to favour an exporter as,27
NA,against other producers in an economy.,28
NA,Apparently the only way that this provision,28
NA,can be avoided is to remit certain taxes,28
NA,which technically are described as indirect,28
NA,rather than direct taxes. Payroll tax is,28
NA,regarded as being an indirect and not a,28
NA,direct form of tax. Details along these lines,28
NA,are to be found in a publication by Her,28
NA,Majesty's Stationery Office of 1964 dealing,28
NA,with the report of the Committee on Turn-,28
NA,over Taxation to which I will refer later in,28
NA,"my speech. In essence, the report points",28
NA,out that as long as a tax is an indirect,28
NA,rather than a direct tax some manipulation,28
NA,of it can be made to assist the promotion,28
NA,of exports.,28
NA,All I wish to draw attention to is the,28
NA,"fact that it is, in my view, rather an unsatis-",28
NA,factory method of dealing with this prob-,28
NA,lem. We can all agree that Australia has to,28
NA,build up increased export markets. It has,28
NA,"been estimated, I think, that we have to",28
NA,increase our exports in total by some Â£200,28
NA,million per annum over the next seven or,28
NA,eight years if our economy is to continue,28
NA,to be able to support the levels of imports,28
NA,to which we have allowed ourselves to,28
NA,become dependent. Using payroll tax as,28
NA,a medium for this increase seems to me to,28
NA,be a fairly inadequate and precarious way,28
NA,of going about things. I direct the attention,28
NA,of honorable members to statistics which,28
NA,are contained in the most recent annual,28
NA,report of the Commissioner of Taxation. I,28
NA,refer to taxation statistics for 1963-64,28
NA,which are part of the 44th annual report,28
NA,to Parliament of the Commissioner of,28
NA,Taxation. At page 155 of this document are,28
NA,to be found details of the rebate of payroll,28
NA,tax on export trade.,28
NA,"The report shows that, for the year",28
NA,"1960-61, 924 separate undertakings were",28
NA,allowed this rebate. These firms between,28
NA,"them had paid Â£11,353,000 in payroll tax",28
NA,and were entitled as the result of the pro-,28
NA,visions of the existing legislation to total,28
NA,"rebates of payroll tax of Â£2,166,000. In",28
NA,196162 the number of claims allowed had,28
NA,"increased to 1,034 and the payroll tax paid",28
NA,"by those concerned was Â£10,400,000. The",28
NA,rebates of payroll tax allowed totalled,28
NA,"Â£3,503,000. In 1962-63 the number of",28
NA,claims allowed dropped to 966. The 966,28
NA,"firms concerned had paid Â£9,021,000 in",28
NA,payroll tax and were entitled to rebates of,28
NA,"Â£2,685,000- a fall of some Â£800,000",28
NA,against the rebate entitlement figure for,28
NA,1961-62. The 1963-64 figures are not con-,28
NA,tained in this report. What I draw attention,28
NA,to is that in terms of export trade as a,28
NA,whole the figures are really fairly insub-,28
NA,stantial. In 1962-63 the figure shows an,28
NA,increase in export trade of Â£164 million,28
NA,over the two base years ended June 1960.,28
NA,That increase is much less than the increase,28
NA,in Australia's export trade that we need,28
NA,year by year if we are to survive. Some,28
NA,other export encouragements are given in,28
NA,legislation. For instance firms which spend,28
NA,money on advertising their goods in poten-,28
NA,tial export income markets are entitled to,28
NA,double tax deductions on expenditure on,28
NA,advertising which is applicable to that form,28
NA,of trade. That is another device which has,28
NA,"been made but, again, there are serious",28
NA,limitations in respect of how far a country,28
NA,can move in this kind of concession by,28
NA,reason of the commitments which it has,28
NA,under G.A.T.T. and other provisions.,28
NA,I come now to the report of the Com-,28
NA,mittee on Turnover Taxation to which I,28
NA,referred earlier. Paragraph 186 on page 57,28
NA,states-,28
NA,"For reasons which will appear below, the",28
NA,choice of possible methods of assessing a value-,28
NA,added tax would have to take account of the,28
NA,United Kingdom's obligations under two inter-,28
NA,national agreements.,28
NA,Only one of the agreements referred to,28
NA,applies to Australia. The two agreements,28
NA,mentioned are the General Agreement on,28
NA,"Tariffs and Trade, which is referred to rather",28
NA,popularly as G.A.T.T. and the other one in,28
NA,the case of the United Kingdom is the,28
NA,"European Free Trade Area Convention,",28
NA,which does not concern us. The report con-,28
NA,tinues-,28
NA,We summarise the relevant provisions of these,28
NA,agreements in Appendix Â£. They preclude various,28
NA,"forms of export subsidy, including subsidies which",28
NA,"operate through the taxation system. Briefly,",28
NA,"certain ""kinds"" of taxes, and in particular direct",28
NA,"taxes on businesses, may not be remitted in respect",28
NA,of exports. The taxes which may be remitted or,28
NA,repaid are:-,28
NA,"(1) taxes charged at importation, for example,",28
NA,"customs duties, and",28
NA,(2) other indirect taxes on the goods exported;,28
NA,"and then the "" amount"" of any repayment may",28
NA,not exceed what has effectively been levied at,28
NA,one or more stages on the goods. These obligations,28
NA,are relevant because the advocates of the value-,28
NA,added tax have assumed that it would be remitted,28
NA,on exports . . . .,28
NA,"The point there, of course, is that as far",29
NA,as Australia is concerned payroll tax has,29
NA,been chosen as the medium to apply this,29
NA,subsidy because it is an indirect tax. This,29
NA,"method, however, suffers from the",29
NA,deficiency that a form of export trade,29
NA,"which is, say, capital intensive rather than",29
NA,"labour intensive, is more or less at a dis-",29
NA,advantage because the maximum amount of,29
NA,rebate which is available is the amount rep-,29
NA,"resented by the payroll tax, which is at the",29
NA,"rate of only 2 i per cent, or 6d. in the",29
NA,the wages bill of the particular undertaking.,29
NA,"A highly mechanised industry, of course, has",29
NA,a relatively small labour component in its,29
NA,"total cost, but the amount of subsidy that",29
NA,it can obtain is governed by the payroll,29
NA,tax. There could be firms which perform,29
NA,as well as other firms in terms of increasing,29
NA,"exports but which, having a very small",29
NA,"labour component in their total costs, would",29
NA,find it very difficult to obtain any appre-,29
NA,ciable benefit from this kind of assistance.,29
NA,"There are other firms, of course, with high",29
NA,labour contents in their total costs and,29
NA,these would receive a considerable advan-,29
NA,tage.,29
NA,The purpose of the amendment proposed,29
NA,in the Bill before us is to correct an,29
NA,anomaly which has been discovered in the,29
NA,operation of the tax rebate scheme as it,29
NA,applies to the motor vehicle industry in,29
NA,particular. Apparently the difficulty has,29
NA,been that in applying the rebate to what,29
NA,are called knocked down vehicles as dis-,29
NA,"tinct from built up vehicles, the knocked",29
NA,down vehicles have been somewhat at a,29
NA,"disadvantage. The Act, as it is currently",29
NA,"written, does not appear to cover trade",29
NA,knocked down vehicles. The amendment is,29
NA,designed to overcome this difficulty.,29
NA,"Of course many countries are doing, with",29
NA,"respect to their motor vehicle industries,",29
NA,what Australia is trying to do today. They,29
NA,are endeavouring to build up an industry of,29
NA,their own. They are endeavouring to have,29
NA,as low as possible a foreign component,29
NA,their vehicles and as high as possible,29
NA,proportion of locally made parts. New,29
NA,"Zealand, Indonesia and some Asian and that",29
NA,"South East Asian countries, in which Aus-",29
NA,tralia has been developing a market for,29
NA,"these goods, say: ""We are quite happy",29
NA,take Australian motor cars but we would,29
NA,"like to do some of the assembling ourselves.""",29
NA,Apparently the law as it currently economic affairs.,29
NA,operates places partially assembled vehicles,29
NA,or unassembled parts at some disadvantage,29
NA,"in this trade, in that they do not qualify",29
NA,for the rebate.,29
NA,"Another factor that must be considered,",29
NA,"of course, is that unassembled vehicles take",29
NA,up far less space than assembled vehicles.,29
NA,There is a big saving in freight charges if,29
NA,parts are packed together for shipping and,29
NA,assembled in the country of destination.,29
NA,"With a fully assembled vehicle, of course,",29
NA,Â£1 on a good deal of the space taken up on the,29
NA,ship is the space that would normally be,29
NA,occupied by the passengers when the motor,29
NA,car was on the road. To pay freight on,29
NA,the basis of space occupied by fully,29
NA,assembled vehicles is a rather extravagant,29
NA,way of exporting them.,29
NA,In order to overcome these two kinds of,29
NA,difficulties this amendment is being intro-,29
NA,duced. Apparently at the same time the,29
NA,Government is trying to secure an internal,29
NA,reform that the motor vehicle industry has,29
NA,been a little reluctant to introduce. I refer,29
NA,to the objective of an Australian com-,29
NA,"ponent of 90 to 95 per cent, in locally",29
NA,assembled vehicles. One of the conditions of,29
NA,the application of this new benefit is that,29
NA,there should be a satisfactory level of Aus-,29
NA,tralian content in the local production and,29
NA,that there should also be a satisfactory,29
NA,proportion of Australian-made exports as,29
NA,against imports which are later exported.,29
NA,If the objective is to be achieved some,29
NA,discretion must be allowed. I have heard,29
NA,many rather nasty things said in this House,29
NA,in the last day or two about the discretion,29
NA,in of the Commissioner of Taxation.,29
NA,Apparently in this case the discretion is not,29
NA,to be exercised by the Commissioner of,29
NA,Taxation but by the Secretary of the De-,29
NA,partment of Trade and Industry in conjunc-,29
NA,tion with the Treasurer. Just what the,29
NA,medium of communication between thc two,29
NA,"of them is I am not quite sure, but I suppose",29
NA,it would not be difficult to establish. In,29
NA,in any case it is on the recommendation of,29
NA,a the Secretary of the Department of Trade,29
NA,"and Industry, confirmed by the Treasurer,",29
NA,a firm will or will not be deemed eligible,29
NA,for the rebate under the amended legislation.,29
NA,to One would perhaps think that there ought,29
NA,to be a little more discretion rather than a,29
NA,little less of it in the operation of modern,29
NA,Mr Kelly -I f it does not go too far.,29
Mr CREAN ,"Well , one can perhaps",30
NA,"carry discretion too far, and I suppose one",30
NA,should not indulge at all in indiscretion. But,30
NA,it seems to me that sometimes when this,30
NA,"nasty word "" discretion "" is used the impli-",30
NA,cation is that it will always be applied in-,30
NA,discretely. This is not my experience of the,30
NA,"Commissioner of Taxation, however. I do",30
NA,"not think he is a sort of inverted Micawber,",30
NA,waiting for something to turn down. He,30
NA,"exercises his discretion, as far as he can,",30
NA,in the interest of the person concerned just,30
NA,as much as in the interest of the preserva-,30
NA,tion of the revenue.,30
NA,So much for this aspect of the Bill. 1 re-,30
NA,"peat that this is a rather unsatisfactory,",30
NA,and corner method of going about subsidis-,30
NA,ing exports. It has distinct limitations. No,30
NA,matter how successful one may be in pro-,30
NA,"moting one's exports, the maximum amount",30
NA,of rebate available to one's firm is,30
NA,"the amount of the payroll tax, which",30
NA,"is 2 i per cent, of the wages bill.",30
NA,So that if wages represented only,30
NA,"half of the total costs, there would",30
NA,be only a rather minor overall incentive,30
NA,"available. In this connection, however, I",30
NA,must remind the House that the whole of,30
NA,"the rebate allowed, as represented by the",30
NA,"payroll tax payable, will be applied in the",30
NA,direction of the export trade rather than of,30
NA,"the total turnover of the company, so that",30
NA,perhaps the advantages are a little more,30
NA,significant than they appear.,30
NA,I think the Treasurer said in his second,30
NA,reading speech that for the year ended,30
NA,June 1965 the total value of motor car,30
NA,exports was about Â£16 million. The figure,30
NA,"for completely assembled vehicles was, I",30
NA,"think, Â£8.3 million, and the value of partly",30
NA,knocked down vehicles and components,30
NA,was Â£7.7 million. I think the Treasurer also,30
NA,directed attention to the fact that over a,30
NA,comparatively small number of years our,30
NA,exports of motor vehicles and components,30
NA,were very similar to our exports of wheaten,30
NA,flour. The flour industry has been in exist-,30
NA,"ence for a long time, and I think in many",30
NA,respects it does not really afford a relevant,30
NA,comparison. I believe that many countries,30
NA,are doing with flour what they are doing,30
NA,with motor cars. They prefer to import their,30
NA,"own wheat and make their own flour, for",30
NA,they then build up an industry that is much,30
NA,needed in underdeveloped countries. The,30
NA,Treasurer made the point that exports of,30
NA,motor cars and components were becoming,30
NA,a quite significant part of Australia's export,30
NA,trade.,30
NA,"It is interesting to note, when one looks",30
NA,at the details of the statistics provided by,30
NA,"the Commissioner of Taxation, that the",30
NA,major beneficiary of this payroll tax rebate,30
NA,"is the metals, metal manufactures and",30
NA,"machinery group of industries which, pre-",30
NA,"sumably, includes the motor car industry.",30
NA,"In thefinancialyear 1960-61, out of rebates",30
NA,"totalling Â£2,166,000, Â£736,000, or slightly",30
NA,"more than one third, went to that group",30
NA,"of industries. In 1961-62 Â£2,130,000 out of",30
NA,"a total of Â£3,503,000 went to that group.",30
NA,This was nearly two thirds of the total. In,30
NA,hole 1962-63 the proportion had dropped to,30
NA,"Â£1,166,000 out of Â£2,685,000. Apparently",30
NA,in that financial year there was relatively,30
NA,a slump in the export performance of that,30
NA,"branch of industry. This, of course, may",30
NA,have had something to do with conditions,30
NA,overseas or may even have been the result,30
NA,of retaliatory measures taken by some,30
NA,countries that had formerly accepted ex-,30
NA,"ports of metals, metal manufactures and",30
NA,machinery without introducing tariff diffi-,30
NA,"culties. I understand that Japan, for in-",30
NA,"stance, has a fairly high tariff on imports",30
NA,of Australian motor vehicles and parts. I,30
NA,do not know what the arrangement in Aus-,30
NA,"tralia concerning Japanese car imports is,",30
NA,but the Japanese car industry seems to be,30
NA,having increasing success in capturing a,30
NA,section of the Australian market.,30
NA,"As I have pointed out, the payroll tax",30
NA,rebate suffers from the other deficiency that,30
NA,its benefits are limited by the wage com-,30
NA,"ponent in total costs. Therefore, to some",30
NA,extent the capital intensive industries are,30
NA,at a disadvantage compared to the labour,30
NA,intensive industries. Surely we in Australia,30
NA,should be encouraging capital intensive,30
NA,rather than labour intensive industries. I,30
NA,hope that the Treasury will further consider,30
NA,this question of the encouragement of ex-,30
NA,"ports, bearing in mind the distinct limitations",30
NA,that apply under the General Agreement,30
NA,on Tariffs and Trade. This form of assist-,30
NA,ance represented by the rebate in respect,30
NA,of payroll tax is rather inadequate when we,30
NA,contemplate the increase in export trade,30
NA,that Australia needs in the years ahead.,30
NA,At this stage I should like to discuss the,30
NA,general position of the payroll tax as it,30
NA,applies in our tax structure. According to,30
NA,the Budget estimates which were presented,31
NA,to us by the Treasurer at the beginning of,31
NA,this sessional period and with which we,31
NA,"dealt not very long ago in this chamber,",31
NA,the right honorable gentleman contem-,31
NA,plated that in the current financial year the,31
NA,payroll tax would yield a total of Â£82,31
NA,million. Excluding from consideration items,31
NA,such as the Post Office-th e self balancing,31
NA,items-th e payroll tax was estimated to be,31
NA,responsible for Â£82 million out of total,31
NA,"tax collections of about Â£2,200,000, or a",31
NA,"little more than 3 per cent, of the total. In",31
NA,"many respects, the payroll tax represents",31
NA,an unsatisfactory form of tax. However,31
NA,fortunate may be the application of the,31
NA,"export rebate, this is a most unsatisfactory",31
NA,form of tax for any modern society to rely,31
NA,on. It came into being in 1941 to finance,31
NA,the payment of child endowment. I believe,31
NA,that in some respects it is still in theory,31
NA,"tied to that benefit. In practice, of course,",31
NA,all the money is paid into one fund-th e,31
NA,Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Com-,31
NA,"missioner of Taxation, in his 44th report,",31
NA,"at page 81, stated-",31
NA,The rate of payroll tax has remained unchanged,31
NA,since its introduction and is Â£2 10s. per centum,31
NA,of wages in excess of the general exemption.,31
NA,"In other words, this represents a tax of",31
NA,6d. in the Â£1 on the wage bill of all those,31
NA,employers that are liable to pay it. Referring,31
NA,to the payroll tax legislation the Com-,31
NA,missioner stated-,31
NA,A feature of the legislation is the wide scope,31
NA,of the tax. Exemptions are limited to wages paid,31
NA,by the Governor-General,31
NA,Presumably for his own staff-,31
NA,"or the Governor of a State, the representatives in",31
NA,"Australia of the Governments of other countries,",31
NA,"public hospitals and certain other hospitals, public",31
NA,benevolent and religious institutions and a few,31
NA,specified organisations such as the South Pacific,31
NA,Commission. Wages paid to members of the,31
NA,Defence Force and certain ancillary services are,31
NA,also exempt.,31
NA,It is specifically provided that the Crown in the,31
NA,"right of a State, municipal and other local",31
NA,ing bodies and public authorities which do not,31
NA,"pay wages from the Consolidated Revenue Fund,",31
NA,are liable for payroll tax.,31
NA,This is the matter with which the amend-,31
NA,ment that we propose to submit in Com-,31
NA,mittee will be concerned. What the Commis-,31
NA,sioner of Taxation did not say in his report,31
NA,was that the Commonwealth Government's,31
NA,own wage bill is specifically exempt from,31
NA,the tax. The Commissioner used the words,31
NA,""" the Crown in the right of a State "". The",31
NA,Crown in the right of the Commonwealth,31
NA,does not pay the tax. I believe that there,31
NA,is a certain legitimate ground for grievance,31
NA,on the part of the States over the Common-,31
NA,wealth's exempting itself from the payment,31
NA,of payroll tax on its wages and specifically,31
NA,providing that the States shall pay the tax,31
NA,on the wage bill concerned with their own,31
NA,administration. I suppose that it may be,31
NA,argued: The States may collectively pay,31
NA,some Â£6 million or Â£8 million in tax in this,31
NA,way but if they did not do so they would,31
NA,only receive Â£6 million or Â£8 million less,31
NA,in reimbursements under the formula,31
NA,adopted under the uniform tax arrange-,31
NA,ments. That may seem a consoling aspect of,31
NA,"the matter, but it seems to me to represent",31
NA,a rather silly form of bookkeeping for one,31
NA,to go to all the trouble of imposing a tax,31
NA,of 6d. in the Â£1 on the wage bills of the,31
NA,States and then to say that they are really,31
NA,reimbursed under the overall uniform tax,31
NA,formula for the sums so paid. This seems,31
NA,to be a silly way of going about the matter.,31
NA,A similar sort of escape is not available,31
NA,to municipal authorities. I turn to what are,31
NA,described in the taxation statistics provided,31
NA,by the Commissioner of Taxation as a,31
NA,"supplement to his 44th report as "" Public",31
NA,"Authority Activities (n.e.i.)"". This ap-",31
NA,parently means that they are not elsewhere,31
NA,included. There is a special section for,31
NA,"electricity, gas and water services, which",31
NA,are subject to public authority ownership.,31
NA,For the purposes of payroll tax statistics,31
NA,they are treated separately. The section,31
NA,given over to public authority activities,31
NA,relates mainly to State administrations plus,31
NA,local government and semi-government acti-,31
NA,vities not related to business undertakings.,31
NA,The figures at page 152 of the taxation,31
NA,statistics show that in June 1964 there,31
NA,were 854 payroll tax returns lodged by,31
NA,employers in this group and that the wage,31
NA,bill of the group in that month totalled,31
NA,"govern- Â£40,088,000. This represents about Â£480",31
NA,million annually. That is about one seventh,31
NA,of the total amount of wages on which pay-,31
NA,roll tax is collected.,31
NA,Statistics show that for the month of,31
NA,June 1964 the total wages on which pay-,31
NA,"roll tax was levied was Â£286,923,000 and",31
NA,the component of that amount representing,31
NA,public authority activities was about Â£40,31
NA,million. This year the estimated collection,31
NA,of payroll tax will be Â£82 million. At a,32
NA,rough guess one seventh of that amount-,32
NA,somewhere in the region of Â£12 million-,32
NA,will be collected by the Commonwealth,32
NA,from public authority activities. Let us ex-,32
NA,clude from consideration the part that be-,32
NA,longs to the States as such in the sense of,32
NA,their own direct administration which is,32
NA,rather consolingly looked after in the tax,32
NA,reimbursement arrangements. That leaves,32
NA,about Â£6 million to be borne by the munici-,32
NA,palities and other forms of activity in the,32
NA,-community. Then looking at the number of,32
NA,"people concerned, I think it is rather sur-",32
NA,prising to see the total employment in,32
NA,public authority activities,32
NA,"tive level, excluding the Commonwealth.",32
NA,The report shows that at June 1964 there,32
NA,"were 337,000 such employees, 251,000 of",32
NA,"whom were males and 86,000 of whom",32
NA,were females. There is a fair body of people,32
NA,"in this field. Of course, the only place that",32
NA,the municipalities can go to obtain funds,32
NA,with which to pay the tax is to their rate-,32
NA,payers.,32
NA,One of the difficulties in government,32
NA,today is that local government seems to bc,32
NA,becoming the poor relation in the adminis-,32
NA,trative hierarchy. We have three levels of,32
NA,"government-Commonwealth , State and",32
NA,local government-an d basically the local,32
NA,government authority relies on a rather anti-,32
NA,quated property system of rating. In many,32
NA,respects it is a very inequitable form of,32
NA,"revenue raising, but in aggregate the munici-",32
NA,pal authorities have this additional burden,32
NA,of about Â£5 or Â£6 million imposed on,32
NA,them by reason of the uncharitable policy,32
NA,of the Federal Government. If this tax of,32
NA,Â£5 to Â£6 million were not imposed by the,32
NA,"Commonwealth, it could well adjust the",32
NA,loss of revenue by more equitable methods,32
NA,of taxation. If the Commonwealth did not,32
NA,impose this tax the various municipalities,32
NA,and other semi-governmental bodies in the,32
NA,community would have this additional sum,32
NA,with which to provide services for their,32
NA,payers or their various constituent members.,32
NA,We have talked of this amendment for,32
NA,many years in this House. I think as far,32
NA,back as 1956 or 1957 we moved a similar,32
NA,amendment because we believed that this,32
NA,"was a silly, messy, inefficient way of col-",32
NA,lecting revenue and that it put an unneces-,32
NA,sary penalty on a very important section of,32
NA,community activity which had no recourse,32
NA,to meeting it other than by raising rates.,32
NA,Local governments are still called upon to,32
NA,provide many important functions. As an,32
NA,"example, let us consider the average muni-",32
NA,cipality in the metropolitan area which,32
NA,might employ between 300 and 500 people.,32
NA,The municipality could well have a wages,32
NA,"bill in the region of Â£500,000 to Â£1 million,",32
NA,"and 2 i per cent, of that is about Â£25,000.",32
NA,I do not believe that I know of any muni-,32
NA,cipality that could not do a great deal with,32
NA,"that Â£25,000. I believe that municipalities",32
NA,"could apply that Â£25,000 more efficiently",32
NA,than the central government could apply,32
NA,the Â£6 million that it receives from those,32
NA,at the administravarious bodies.,32
NA,I believe that one of the difficulties that,32
NA,we are suffering from in our governmental,32
NA,system at the moment is the kind of,32
NA,marginal starvation at the State and local,32
NA,government boundaries. Where such things,32
NA,as baby health services or greater provision,32
NA,"for library services are required, to take just",32
NA,"a couple of examples, local government",32
NA,bodies are often looking about for sums as,32
NA,"small as a few hundred pounds and, cer-",32
NA,"tainly, a few thousand pounds would be a",32
NA,very welcome bonus to most of them with,32
NA,which I have had any experience. We there-,32
NA,fore urge the Government to take a serious,32
NA,look once more at the whole question of,32
NA,payroll tax. I hope that some day this tax,32
NA,will be abolished because it seems to me,32
NA,to be a very silly form of taxation. It is,32
NA,"imposed at a flat per centum rate, and the",32
NA,fact that it has remained unchanged since,32
NA,1941 when it was introduced simply points,32
NA,to the fact that it is regarded as an easy,32
NA,way of raising Â£80 million. But it is cer-,32
NA,tainly inequitable in its application. It is,32
NA,applied whether or not an undertaking is,32
NA,successful. It is not like company tax. At,32
NA,least that tax is levied only if the concern,32
NA,makes a profit. If an industry in a country,32
NA,town or somewhere else were struggling to,32
NA,survive it might be given some relief if,32
NA,rateit were relieved of its payroll tax burden.,32
NA,This tax falls heaviest on the industry,32
NA,"which employs the most labour, and it",32
NA,applies irrespective of the state of the,32
NA,industry.,32
NA,"No matter where we live, in the smallest",32
NA,"municipality or the biggest, we are still",32
NA,Australians and we should be able to have,32
NA,the same sorts of standards from one part,32
NA,to the other. But the harsh application of,32
NA,tbe payroll tax is a real impediment in some,33
NA,of the smaller municipalities. As I have,33
NA,"suggested, often the services languish just",33
NA,for the sake of a few hundred or a few,33
NA,thousand pounds. I urge the Government,33
NA,to realise that it is time it gave serious,33
NA,thought to whether the whole structure of,33
NA,"taxation should be reconsidered, but in par-",33
NA,ticular that it should contemplate anew the,33
NA,necessity to continue the payroll tax. Even,33
NA,if it does not want to take the courageous,33
NA,"step of abolishing the tax all at once, at",33
NA,least it could move in the right direction,33
NA,here as it is moving in the right direction,33
NA,with the export bounty. It could remove the,33
NA,tax as it applies to municipal and other local,33
NA,governing bodies. I shall formally move,33
NA,"the amendment in Committee. Meanwhile,",33
NA,I have foreshadowed it and have outlined,33
NA,the detailed case upon which we base our,33
NA,suggestion. We do not oppose the pro-,33
NA,visions of the measure as they apply to the,33
NA,"export bounty, but we would like to see",33
NA,the extension of the exemption to cover,33
NA,not only the Commonwealth as such in,33
NA,respect of its employees but also municipal,33
NA,and local government bodies.,33
Dr FORBES ,Barker-Ministe r for the,33
NA,Army) [4.25] -Befor e the second reading,33
NA,"debate goes any further, I should like to",33
NA,take the opportunity of indicating the,33
NA,Government's attitude to the amendment,33
NA,foreshadowed by the honorable member for,33
NA,Melbourne Ports ( Mr Crean). The Govern-,33
NA,ment is unable to accept the amendment.,33
NA,As is clear from the terms of the amend-,33
NA,"ment, it seeks to exempt from payroll tax",33
NA,wages that are paid by local government,33
NA,authorities and comparable bodies where the,33
NA,wages are not paid in respect of the con-,33
NA,duct of a trading enterprise.,33
NA,This proposal has very serious revenue,33
NA,"implications. Indeed, as I shall show, it has",33
NA,serious implications in connection with the,33
NA,basis of Commonwealth-State financial,33
NA,"relations. If implemented, it would involve",33
NA,substantial losses of revenue. I remind,33
NA,honorable members that the payroll tax,33
NA,base is a very wide one. Payroll tax is a,33
NA,levy on all employers whose payrolls,33
NA,"exceed Â£10,400 per annum, with the",33
NA,"exception of government, vice-regal and.",33
NA,"diplomatic establishments, public benevo-",33
NA,"lent and religious institutions, public",33
NA,hospitals. Commonwealth authorities-th e,33
NA,wages of which are paid out of the Consoli-,33
NA,"dated Revenue Fund, as mentioned by the",33
NA,honorable member for Melbourne Ports-,33
NA,and certain international organisations.,33
NA,Honorable members will agree that this,33
NA,makes the payroll tax base a very wide one,33
NA,indeed.,33
NA,States and their authorities are liable to,33
NA,"the tax. On the face of it, the proposal con-",33
NA,tained in the amendment foreshadowed by,33
NA,the honorable member for Melbourne Ports,33
NA,"would seem to be a fairly simple one, but",33
NA,in practice there would be difficulty in de-,33
NA,fining trading activities and in distinguish-,33
NA,ing trading from non-trading activities of,33
NA,"local authorities. Further, the functions per-",33
NA,formed by local authorities vary consider-,33
NA,"ably from State to State. If, therefore, the",33
NA,honorable member's proposal were,33
NA,accepted it would be difficult to justify,33
NA,refusing to extend similar exemptions to,33
NA,State Governments and their semi-govern-,33
NA,mental authorities.,33
NA,Honorable members will see the point.,33
NA,"For example, State authorities in South",33
NA,Australia do not conduct many of the,33
NA,activities which are conducted by local,33
NA,authorities in Queensland. I mention,33
NA,sewerage services by way of illustration. It,33
NA,would therefore be quite inequitable that,33
NA,payroll tax should not be levied on a local,33
NA,authority in Queensland but should be,33
NA,levied on a semi-governmental authority,33
NA,which provides a sewerage service in South,33
NA,"Australia. Needless to say, the granting of",33
NA,widespread exemptions of this type would,33
NA,"lead to a considerable loss of revenue, and,",33
NA,"all other things being equal, the Common-",33
NA,wealth would have to seek to replace this,33
NA,revenue from other sources. It is estimated,33
NA,that the cost for a full year of exempting,33
NA,local government bodies from payroll tax,33
NA,would be of the order of Â£2.9 million. If,33
NA,the exemption were to be extended to semi-,33
NA,"governmental authorities, the cost might be",33
NA,as high as Â£13 million. Against that last,33
NA,figure I set the estimated payroll tax collec-,33
NA,tion for the current year. As mentioned by,33
NA,"the honorable member for Melbourne Ports,",33
NA,"it is Â£82 million. Therefore, the possible loss",33
NA,of revenue to the Commonwealth would be,33
NA,Â£13 million out of Â£82 million.,33
NA,"As I have said, this proposal would have",33
NA,serious implications for Commonwealth-,33
NA,State financial relations. Under both the,33
NA,1959 arrangements and those entered into,33
NA,"this year, financial assistance grants are",33
NA,being provided to the States expressly on,34
NA,the understanding that there will be no,34
NA,change in the financial arrangements,34
NA,between the Commonwealth on the one,34
NA,hand and the States and their authorities on,34
NA,"the other, and, in particular, no change in",34
NA,the liability of the States and their,34
NA,"ties to payroll tax. It was, of course, in-",34
NA,tended that this understanding would cover,34
NA,local authorities which are constituted under,34
NA,the laws of the States. This was agreed to,34
NA,hy the State Premiers at conferences at,34
NA,which the financial assistance arrangements,34
NA,"were negotiated. In other words, the finan-",34
NA,cial arrangements between the Common-,34
NA,wealth and the States are based on a,34
NA,"specific understanding, arrived at after",34
NA,"cussions, that local authorities will pay payoutside",34
NA,roll tax.,34
NA,The amendment foreshadowed by the,34
NA,honorable member for Melbourne Ports,34
NA,would certainly alter this position. If it,34
NA,"to the granting of wider exemptions, it",34
NA,would seriously prejudice the basis of the,34
NA,arrangements governing financial assistance,34
NA,grants. Honorable members may care to,34
NA,"refer to the document "" Commonwealth",34
NA,"Payments to or for the States, 1965-66"",",34
NA,which the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) pre-,34
NA,sented at the time when he presented the,34
NA,last Budget. On pages 14 to 16 of this docu-,34
NA,"ment, the Treasurer explains the basis of",34
NA,the arrangements governingfinancialassist-,34
NA,ance grants. I say this additionally to my,34
NA,point about the discussions which have,34
NA,taken place from time to time between the,34
NA,Commonwealth and the States on the,34
NA,financial assistance arrangements. I regret,34
NA,that when the amendment is ultimately,34
NA,moved the Government will not be able to,34
NA,accept it.,34
Mr MORTIMER ,Grey) [4.31] - I find,34
NA,it extremely regrettable that the Government,34
NA,has already intimated that it will not accept,34
NA,the amendment foreshadowed by the honor-,34
NA,able member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr.,34
NA,Crean). I found it difficult to follow the,34
NA,argument submitted by the Minister for the,34
NA,"Army (Dr Forbes), but no doubt by the",34
NA,time we discuss the Bill in committee we,34
NA,shall have had an opportunity to study thc,34
NA,Minister's speech and probably we shall,34
NA,know exactly the point he is trying to make.,34
NA,My thoughts on the amendment were that it,34
NA,proposed only the exemption of local,34
NA,governing bodies from the payment of pay-,34
NA,roll tax. I think the Minister was trying to,34
NA,confuse the issue when he made his speech.,34
NA,The legislation now before the House is,34
NA,aimed at providing further incentives and,34
NA,assistance to exporters and has been made,34
NA,authorinecessary because the Government has,34
NA,finally come to the conclusion that it has,34
NA,been sadly lacking in providing sufficient,34
NA,leadership and encouragement to manu-,34
NA,facturers to enter the export market with,34
NA,the products of our secondary industries.,34
NA,"With a few notable exceptions, either",34
NA,because of patent restrictions or a very dis-,34
NA,tinct reluctance on the part of manufacturers,34
NA,to take the risks and the responsibilities of,34
NA,dis- searching out and supplying fresh markets,34
NA,"of the mainland, sufficient considera-",34
NA,tion has not been given to building up our,34
NA,export trade with the products of our,34
NA,secondary industries. We on this side of the,34
NA,House believe that the Government must,34
NA,led give more generous encouragement not only,34
NA,to furthering the exports of secondary indus-,34
NA,tries but also to the expansion of established,34
NA,enterprises and the development of new,34
NA,industries within the Commonwealth.,34
NA,Great credit must go to the Common-,34
NA,wealth Scientific and Industrial Research,34
NA,"Organisation, which has made notable con-",34
NA,tributions to the improvement of both our,34
NA,"secondary and primary industries, but",34
NA,Australia has reached a stage where the,34
NA,Commonwealth must take on the responsi-,34
NA,bility of planning on national lines for the,34
NA,"development of secondary industries,",34
NA,because the tremendous decisions that have,34
NA,now to be faced cannot be solved by States,34
NA,or individual businesses. Many of the,34
NA,opportunities to start new enterprises or to,34
NA,exploit our natural mineral and other,34
NA,resources are lost to Australian ownership,34
NA,because of the reluctance or inability of,34
NA,Australian enterprise to assume the initial,34
NA,"risk, or because we do not possess technical",34
NA,advisers capable or willing of appraising and,34
NA,advising on the opportunities that are now,34
NA,open to Australian capital. The Committee,34
NA,of Economic Enquiry has delved very,34
NA,"thoroughly into this particular subject, and",34
NA,although the Government seems loath to,34
NA,give any real credence to many aspects of,34
NA,"the report, it must admit that the Com-",34
NA,mittee was stating plain common truth and,34
NA,fact when it suggested that a body similar to,34
NA,the United Economic Development Council,34
NA,"of the United Kingdom, the Economic",34
NA,Council of Canada and similar bodies in,35
NA,other major exporting countries should be,35
NA,"set up in Australia. Such a body, if set up",35
NA,"in Australia, could consult with and advise",35
NA,industry and the Government on what was,35
NA,economically possible and of the dangers,35
NA,that must be avoided or overcome. More,35
NA,and more are we made aware of the con-,35
NA,gestion that is taking place in our cities and,35
NA,of the absolute need for decentralisation.,35
NA,We kuow of the uncertain outlook in world,35
NA,markets for some of our primary products.,35
NA,We read statistical forecasts of our labour,35
NA,potential if the present rate of immigration,35
NA,"is continued, and many students and com-",35
NA,mentators forecast the need for Australian,35
NA,industry to develop so that our future work,35
NA,force can be employed.,35
NA,The rapidly improving technology of pri-,35
NA,"mary production, and its ability to produce",35
NA,greater quantities with a much reduced work,35
NA,"force, throws the additional burden of pro-",35
NA,viding employment for our quickly expand-,35
NA,ing work force on to secondary industry and,35
NA,"this Government. We are forced, for purely",35
NA,"economic reasons, with the absolute neces-",35
NA,sity of increasing work opportunity in other,35
NA,fields open to us. In an address delivered,35
NA,at the National Press Club luncheon in,35
NA,which he countered criticism of the Vernon,35
NA,"Committee, of which he was a member, Sir",35
NA,John Crawford said-,35
NA,"Taking a view of export prospects, it was con-",35
NA,cluded that a major effort would have to be made,35
NA,"to increase manufactured exports, if export returns",35
NA,were to be adequate to meet the likely growth,35
NA,in demand for imports.,35
NA,He also said-,35
NA,Manufacturers will certainly need to provide an,35
NA,increasing share of exports. They will not be able,35
NA,"to do this unless they are efficient, and efficiency",35
NA,is the keynote of the Committee's views and sug-,35
NA,gestions' on manufacturing. All the proposals for,35
NA,encouraging efficiency are well within normal,35
NA,economic policies adopted by other economies.,35
NA,"In the book "" The Development of Aus-",35
NA,"tralia "", prepared for the Australian",35
NA,Development Research Foundation by the,35
NA,"Stanford Research Institute of California,",35
NA,much the same thing is stated. We find,35
NA,following comments-,35
NA,"In the past, and to a great extent still,",35
NA,tralia has relied upon exports of primary products,35
NA,"to purchase its imports of equipment, petroleum,",35
NA,manufacturing materials and other producers',35
NA,goods. The growth of manufactures has been pri-,35
NA,marily for the local market. . . .,35
NA,At present most Austrahan enterprises lack the,35
NA,"built-in research facilities, managerial experience",35
NA,and marketing know-how to compete effectively in,35
NA,world markets. There are examples of small as,35
NA,well as large enterprises being successful with,35
NA,exports; but the change from local markets shel-,35
NA,tered by tariff protection and import restrictions,35
NA,to the ruthless competition of world markets,35
NA,requires a degree of sophistication still lacking,35
NA,in most enterprises.,35
NA,Dependence on technology derived from over-,35
NA,seas often results in export restrictions being writ-,35
NA,ten into patent and licensing agreements. The rela-,35
NA,tive shortage of trained technicians and research,35
NA,facilities also makes it difficult for management,35
NA,to appraise the risks involved in new enterprises,35
NA,or extension into new markets. There is more,35
NA,potential risk capital than is often realised. The,35
NA,most serious deficiency in Australian enterprise is,35
NA,"the reluctance of management, largely for lack of",35
NA,"adequate experience and research assistance, to",35
NA,take calculated risks in new developmental ven-,35
NA,"tures, as it does for example in building con-",35
NA,struction in the cities.,35
NA,"Foreign enterprise, often with minimum invest-",35
NA,"ment, is able to calculate and assume such risks,",35
NA,supplementing the initial investment by local,35
NA,borrowing and reinvestment of profits. If Aus-,35
NA,tralian firms were equipped with more adequate,35
NA,"built-in research and technical facilities, they",35
NA,"could borrow the necessary capital, abroad if",35
NA,"not within Australia, and hire technicians, and",35
NA,therefore reap the profits of enterprise which now,35
NA,accrue to foreign firms.,35
NA,The Labour Party supports the move to,35
NA,provide rebates of payroll tax for increased,35
NA,"export sales as, in fact, it falls directly in",35
NA,line with the long established policy of the,35
NA,Labour Party which is to reduce indirect,35
NA,"taxation untU it is finally removed, except",35
NA,where an indirect tax is needed to achieve,35
NA,the purpose of planning or regulation. Over-,35
NA,"seas industrialists, more often than not with",35
NA,"assistance from their governments, train or",35
NA,hire specialists in marketing and economic,35
NA,"research. These highly trained specialists,",35
NA,again more often than not working in con-,35
NA,junction with their own country's economic,35
NA,"and development council, assess potential",35
NA,foreign markets and report back the prob-,35
NA,lems and possibilities attached to sales,35
NA,development and the attendant risks. The,35
NA,Government must share the responsibility,35
NA,with private enterprise in this matter.,35
NA,I turn now to the question of local go-,35
NA,"the vernment and municipal bodies, a number",35
NA,of which have approached me asking that,35
NA,Ausrepresentations be made for exemption from,35
NA,the payment of payroll tax. The honorable,35
NA,member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Crean),35
NA,has foreshadowed an amendment in respect,35
NA,of which he made some good points. It is,35
NA,my experience that if there is one common,35
NA,factor more than another which unites all,35
NA,Australian local government bodies it is,36
NA,without doubt the resentment they share in,36
NA,having to pay Federal payroll tax. Objec-,36
NA,tions have been raised by all local govern-,36
NA,ment bodies in my electorate to paying,36
NA,this iniquitous imposition. They are all,36
NA,joined with the Municipal Association of,36
NA,South Australia in its continued and vigorous,36
NA,campaign for the complete exemption of all,36
NA,local governing bodies from the payment of,36
NA,payroll tax. Over a long period representa-,36
NA,"tions have been made to the Prime Minister,",36
NA,to the Treasurer and to individual members,36
NA,of Parliament by organisations registering,36
NA,protests against a Federal policy which re-,36
NA,quires local government to load its rates,36
NA,in order to pay a Federal revenue tax. The,36
NA,Opposition is firm in the belief that the,36
NA,Treasurer cannot justify further delay in,36
NA,giving these bodies complete exemption,36
NA,from the payment of payroll tax.,36
NA,Knowing the great interest country,36
NA,"members take in local government, and",36
NA,their knowledge of the greatly increased,36
NA,responsibilities attached to local governvaried,36
NA,"ment bodies over the years, coupled with",36
NA,fhe fact fhat their burden has increased,36
NA,to the extent that even with the most limited.,36
NA,stringent and careful management they are,36
NA,continually and consistently in debt and,36
NA,unable to keep up with the demands made,36
NA,"on them, I ask members of the Country",36
NA,Party whether their local government bodies,36
NA,are happy to pay the payroll tax or,36
NA,whether they raise the same objections,36
NA,"do those in my electorate. If they do,",36
NA,what does the Country Party plan to,36
NA,about it? Will it vote for the Labour Party,36
NA,amendment' or ignore the justice of the,36
NA,claim of these local bodies? We can hope,36
NA,only that when a division is called justice,36
NA,will prevail. The Australian Council of it,36
NA,Local Government Associations claims,36
NA,that is has made numerous representations,36
NA,to the Treasurer on behalf of local capital,36
NA,authorities seeking exemptions from the,36
NA,payment ot payroll tax but that it has,36
NA,never been given any reason that comwithin,36
NA,pletely answers the points raised by local,36
NA,government. We trust' that on this occasion,36
NA,the Treasurer will answer these questions,36
NA,and will not go into a brown study to of,36
NA,search for reasons for refusing the requests.,36
NA,We hope he will agree with the Labour,36
NA,Party amendment.,36
NA,In support of their claims to total,36
NA,"exemption, local bodies claim that the",36
NA,Treasurer ignores the principle involved,36
NA,in the ridiculous state of affairs whereby,36
NA,a higher level of government imposes a,36
NA,revenue tax on a lower level of government,36
NA,which is non-profit making and which has,36
NA,extremely limited means of raising finance.,36
NA,In pointing out that State Governments,36
NA,"pay payroll tax, the Treasurer seems to",36
NA,ignore the fact that this is taken into,36
NA,account when the States are reimbursed,36
NA,under the uniform tax system. No reim-,36
NA,bursement or adjustment is made to local,36
NA,"government bodies, which are, in most",36
NA,"cases, totally dependent on the Common-",36
NA,"wealth and the States, as well as on incomes",36
NA,"from their own rates, for finance to meet",36
NA,all commitments. I am sure that the State,36
NA,Governments assist local government,36
NA,bodies to the best of their financial,36
NA,ability- I know this is so in South Australia,36
NA,-bu t under our present system of Federal,36
NA,control the States are to an astonishing,36
NA,degree dependent on the Federal Treasury,36
NA,for finance to carry out their many and,36
NA,"commitments. Accordingly, the",36
NA,ability of the States to provide finance to,36
NA,local government bodies is extremely,36
NA,To ascertain whether consideration was,36
NA,being given by local government bodies to,36
NA,increasing rates I contacted a number of,36
NA,them. Invariably I was told that rates had,36
NA,as been increased from time to time but that,36
NA,if they were increased excessively there,36
NA,do would be a definite burden on property,36
NA,owners. Let me refer to the position in,36
NA,"Whyalla, which is an industrial town with",36
NA,a large percentage of workers' homes. The,36
NA,local government authority there states that,36
NA,is extremely reluctant to increase rates as,36
NA,the average ratepayer already pays between,36
NA,Â£18 and Â£20 a year on the unimproved,36
NA,value of his property. It is claimed,36
NA,that many of the functions undertaken by,36
NA,local government authorities are of a social,36
NA,or welfare nature which could well come,36
NA,the ambit of the Commonwealth's,36
NA,activities and be met by Federal income,36
NA,tax revenue. Local government authorities,36
NA,express real concern at the growing nature,36
NA,the activities which are not their direct,36
NA,responsibility but which they are called,36
NA,upon to finance. They frankly state that,36
NA,they cannot afford to continue to do this,36
NA,and at the same time properly discharge the,37
NA,ever growing obligations which properly,37
NA,belong to them. It is claimed that payroll,37
NA,tax is an uneconomical tax and a direct,37
NA,"penalty on the employer, creating additional",37
NA,book work. It is claimed that the cost of,37
NA,collecting the tax is high in relation to the,37
NA,revenue received.,37
NA,Local government authorities are con-,37
NA,cerned with the development of the areas,37
NA,which they serve-wit h the continued and,37
NA,in some cases rapid development of those,37
NA,areas. Morefinanceis needed each year by,37
NA,local government bodies. If the Treasurer,37
NA,were to make a survey of the absolute needs,37
NA,of this important arm of government even,37
NA,he must concede the necessity to make,37
NA,larger grants to local government bodies,37
NA,rather than grab back from these bodies,37
NA,"sums of money, whether they be large or",37
NA,"small, that are desperately needed in the",37

NA,"1963-64 1,310",37
NA,The table shows that the amount of pay-,37
NA,roll tax paid by local government authorities,37
NA,has assumed alarming proportions. In 1963-,37
NA,64 the amount paid reached the astonishing,37
NA,"total of Â£2,600,000, which is more than",37
NA,twice as much as was paid in 1954-55.,37
NA,I have referred to the major objections,37
NA,raised by local government authorities to the,37
NA,"payment of this tax, which deprives them of",37
NA,the finance that they desperately need for,37
NA,"kerbing, paving, sealing, maintenance and",37
NA,101 other projects. In considering the Oppo-,37
NA,"sition's amendment, the Treasurer must take",37
NA,into account the added burden and responsi-,37
NA,bilities imposed on State Governments and,37
NA,local government authorities by our,37
NA,immigration programme. There is more than,37
NA,general agreement that we must step up,37
NA,immigration and individually share the,37
NA,areas from which they are derived. Every,37
NA,effort must be made to boost our secondary,37
NA,exports. I know that this view is shared,37
NA,generally by honorable members on both,37
NA,sides of the House. So we must agree that,37
NA,"the rebate of Â£1,150,000 paid to 435",37
NA,exporting firms during the first three months,37
NA,of this financial year was a step in the,37
NA,"right direction. If we agree with this action,",37
NA,how much more must we agree that local,37
NA,government must be given the same,37
NA,"privilege, for there is surely no local govern-",37
NA,ment body which has not assisted in every,37
NA,way possible any industry which has moved,37
NA,into its area. To indicate the additional,37
NA,work undertaken by local government,37
NA,"authorities over the past 10 years, with the",37
NA,concurrence of honorable members I in-,37

NA,fact that a faster than natural growth of,37
NA,population places a greatly increased strain,37
NA,on the financial resources of the States and,37
NA,particularly on those of local government,37
NA,authorities.,37
NA,A further matter which the Treasurer is,37
NA,asked to consider is the total exemption,37
NA,from local government assessments enjoyed,37
NA,by Crown lands and government buildings.,37
NA,I will refer in more detail to this matter,37
NA,"later if time permits, but for the present I",37
NA,will deal with specific areas. I recently had,37
NA,discussions with the Whyalla City Com-,37
NA,"mission. Last year it paid Â£1,150 in payroll",37
NA,tax. This year the Commission estimates that,37
NA,"it will pay about Â£1,500. Non-ratable build-",37
NA,ings included in the Commission's area are,37
NA,Postmaster-General's Department depots,38
NA,and post offices. Four years ago the popula-,38
NA,"tion of the area numbered 17,000. Today it",38
NA,"numbers 22,000. Two-thirds of the area",38
NA,tinder the control of the City Commission,38
NA,is still Crown land and therefore non-,38
NA,ratable. Nevertheless the Commission is,38
NA,obliged to build roads around or through,38
NA,that area. The Commission has an overdraft,38
NA,"of Â£50,000. The Commission has large sums",38
NA,of money outstanding in loans..,38
NA,I turn now to the affairs of the Cowell,38
NA,District Council. Most of the State instru-,38
NA,mentalities pay rates to the Council. The,38
NA,only Commonwealth buildings in Cowell are,38
NA,those owned by the Postal Department and,38
NA,the Department of Civil Aviation. These are,38
NA,non-ratable. Rates are not paid in respect,38
NA,of the aerodrome. The Council is obliged,38
NA,to make a compulsory grant to the local,38
NA,hospital under the Public Hospitals Act.,38
NA,"That grant amounts to Â£1,250 a year. A new",38
NA,road between Cowell and Cleve is held up,38
NA,through lack of funds. At least two other,38
NA,"important road projects in the area, which",38
NA,have been examined by the Highways,38
NA,"Department, are held up because of lack",38
NA,"of funds. The Mangalo Road, which is near",38
NA,"a silo, and the Miltowie Road now bear",38
NA,heavy grain traffic and traffic carrying full,38
NA,loads of superphosphate.,38
NA,The Cummins District Council states that,38
NA,"within its area are 100,000 acres of non-",38
NA,ratable property. This property consists of,38
NA,"Crown land, the Uley Basin, Engineering",38
NA,and Water Supply Department catchment,38
NA,areas and government buildings and,38
NA,schools. The Council pays a compulsory,38
NA,"grant of Â£1,900 to local hospitals under the",38
NA,Public Hospitals Act. Of this amount Â£400,38
NA,is paid in respect of Port Lincoln Hospital,38
NA,"and Â£1,500 in respect of Cummins Hos-",38
NA,pital. The loss in rates not paid on non-,38
NA,ratable properties would amount to between,38
NA,"Â£7,000 and Â£10,000 a year. If we add to that",38
NA,amount the amount lost by not rating the,38
NA,"hospital, we find that the Council is out",38
NA,"pocket by up to Â£13,000 a year. New areas",38
NA,are being opened. A road has been congood,38
NA,structed from Kapinnie to Kiama. No rates,38
NA,are received from the Government Produce,38
NA,"Department, which is a fairly big Departthose",38
NA,ment. Rates are not paid by the Forestry,38
NA,"Department, the Postmaster-General's",38
NA,Department or the Engineering and Water,38
NA,Supply Department. The rate earning provide,38
NA,"capacity of an area of 1,817 square miles",38
NA,"has been virtually taken away, although",38
NA,"rates of Â£100,000 would have been received",38
NA,from this area.,38
NA,"At Port Pirie, the Commonwealth",38
NA,"Government makes use of all the services,",38
NA,but does not want to contribute to their,38
NA,cost. Of the total area administered by tbe,38
NA,"Council, 20 per cent, is non-ratable property",38
NA,owned by the Commonwealth and State,38
NA,Governments. If these Governments paid,38
NA,"rates, it is estimated that the rates would",38
NA,"total Â£21,562. The Council pays a contri-",38
NA,bution to the hospital. Payroll tax for the,38
NA,"lastfinancialyear amounted to Â£1,555. The",38
NA,Council at Jamestown makes a voluntary,38
NA,contribution to the hospital. The amount,38
NA,of book work involved is out of proportion,38
NA,to the amount of payroll tax that is paid.,38
NA,"At Tumby Bay, the main project not com-",38
NA,pleted because of lack of finance is the,38
NA,ablution block at Tumby Bay caravan park.,38
NA,The Council applied for a subsidy for 1965-,38
NA,"66, but this was refused. A total of Â£36,000",38
NA,was allocated to the Tourist Bureau in South,38
NA,Australia. Applications were made for sub-,38
NA,"sidies amounting to Â£55,000. In this year,",38
NA,an application was made forfinancialassis-,38
NA,"tance to seal a road in Tumby Bay, but no",38
NA,money was allocated. No money has been,38
NA,allocated up to the present for the sealing of,38
NA,the road to Cummins and to Ungarra. The,38
NA,"road is sealed to Lipson, but from there",38
NA,about 15 miles is unsealed. Heavy transport,38
NA,uses the road. Fertiliser is carried one way,38
NA,and wheat the other. Goods sent to Adelaide,38
NA,are transported over these roads before they,38
NA,reach the main highway. The rates lost,38
NA,on non-ratable Government properties,38
NA,amounted to Â£976. The Council borrowed,38
NA,"Â£18,300 this year to buy road making",38
NA,equipment. Next year it would like to go,38
NA,ahead with a few more roads. Township,38
NA,streets always need attention.,38
NA,The Council at Cleve comments that,38
NA,"rates, like most taxes, must be considered",38
NA,of within the ability of the people to pay. The,38
NA,ability of people to pay may not be as,38
NA,in this area as it is in more closely,38
NA,"settled areas, although the amenities pro-",38
NA,vided by the Council must be as good as,38
NA,provided in the more closely settled,38
NA,areas. Payroll tax in this district represents,38
NA,Â£1 for every day of the year. If this amount,38
NA,"were paid into a long term loan, it would",38
NA,additional medical facilities or a,38
NA,mile or two of roads. The Council's financial,39
NA,position is not bright. It is hoped that not,39
NA,"more than 10 per cent, of its revenue will",39
NA,be overdrawn. It pays a contribution of,39
NA,"Â£1,700 per annum to the Cleve hospital.",39
NA,"The Council hopes that, with increasing",39
NA,revenue and by reducing work slightly in,39
NA,"the next financial year, it may break even.",39
NA,If the Commonwealth Railways at Port,39
NA,Augusta were a private enterprise and paid,39
NA,"rates, the rates would amount to Â£23,000",39
NA,"per annum. The Post Office, including the",39
NA,"line depots and so on, would pay Â£900.",39
NA,"This would include residences, on which",39
NA,rates are now paid. The Council at Port,39
NA,Augusta pays Â£700 in payroll tax. It makes,39
NA,"a contribution of Â£2,400 per annum to the",39
NA,hospital. Â£700 to the fire brigade and,39
NA,"Â£10,000 for parks, gardens and so on. It",39
NA,"pays customs duty on the diesel fuel it uses,",39
NA,and this amounts to Â£350 per annum at,39
NA,the rate of ls. a gallon. The Council applied,39
NA,to thc Department of Customs and Excise,39
NA,"for an exemption, but the application was",39
NA,refused. Work held up because of lack of.,39
NA,finance is mainly work on the roads. The,39
NA,Council cannot afford an Olympic swimming,39
NA,pool or a public library because of lack,39
NA,of funds. It has borrowed for a lot of work.,39
NA,Rates on Commonwealth buildings would,39
NA,amount to one-third of the total rate,39
NA,revenue. I could give details of the situation,39
NA,of many other councils if I had time.,39
NA,I ask the Treasurer to give very symabolition,39
NA,pathetic consideration to the amendment,39
NA,propose to move. The local government,39
NA,bodies in my area are desperately in need,39
NA,of finance and they consider that the,39
NA,roll tax is a definite imposition on them.,39
NA,I join with the councils in asking that the,39
NA,Treasurer accept the amendment.,39
Mr JONES ,Newcastle) [5.1] -Th e main,39
NA,purpose of the Bill is to exempt from,39
NA,roll tax the Commonwealth War Graves,39
NA,Commission and to extend the export incencompany,39
NA,tives scheme to motor car manufacturers,39
NA,respect of vehicles that are exported in,39
NA,knocked down condition. We on this side,39
NA,of the House completely support the incluability,39
NA,sion of the War Graves Commission in the,39
NA,list of those exempted from payroll tax.,39
NA,We also support the extension of the,39
NA,"incentives scheme. We will, therefore, supsideration",39
NA,"port the Bill. However, in the Committee",39
NA,stage the honorable member for Melbourne,39
NA,Ports ( Mr Crean) will move an amendment,39
NA,that is designed to exempt from payroll tax,39
NA,"all municipal bodies, local councils and",39
NA,similar authorities doing the work normally,39
NA,performed by local government bodies. We,39
NA,believe that these organisations at least,39
NA,should be exempted from the payment of,39
NA,this iniquitous form of taxation.,39
NA,Payroll tax is an unnecessary form,39
NA,of taxation which places an unneces-,39
NA,sary burden on the economy as a whole.,39
NA,"Last year, payroll tax collections amounted",39
NA,"to Â£75,038,000 and it is expected that this",39
NA,year the tax will yield Â£82 million. This in,39
NA,itself imposes an unnecessary burden on the,39
NA,general price structure and the economy as,39
NA,a whole. No matter how we regard payroll,39
NA,"tax, the Â£75 million collected last year and",39
NA,the Â£82 million expected to be collected this,39
NA,year will have a very definite effect on tbe,39
NA,cost structure of Australia. Motor cars,39
NA,exported in a knocked down condition will,39
NA,"now be excluded from this form of taxation,",39
NA,but the price of motor vehicles purchased,39
NA,by industry in Australia will be increased by,39
NA,payroll tax. Not one item that is needed by,39
NA,the community will remain unaffected by,39
NA,"this tax. The costs of foodstuffs, clothing and",39
NA,the general cost of living will be increased,39
NA,because of the imposition of payroll tax.,39
NA,"If this tax were abolished, I believe that",39
NA,living costs would decline by the Â£82 million,39
NA,that is expected to be collected this year.,39
NA,For a government that is allegedly concerned,39
NA,"at the inflationary spiral in this country, the",39
NA,of this tax is one method whereby,39
NA,we inflation can be curtailed to some extent.,39
NA,The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) said,39
NA,"paysome years ago, and has continued to say,",39
NA,that if payroll fax were eliminated the,39
NA,Treasury would have to obtain the necessary,39
NA,revenue from other sources. The Opposition,39
NA,agrees that other sources would have to,39
NA,"paybe explored, even if it meant increasing",39
NA,income tax or even if it meant increasing,39
NA,tax. Those two fields could afford,39
NA,in to supply the necessary revenue. Indirect,39
NA,a forms of taxation are inequitable because,39
NA,they do not take into consideration the,39
NA,of the person to pay. Payroll lax,39
NA,is an indirect form of taxation. So is sales,39
NA,"tax which is imposed on cigarettes, petrol",39
NA,export and many other commodities. No con-,39
NA,whatsoever is given to the ability,39
NA,of the individual to pay. A person on the,39
NA,basic wage pays the same amount of,39
NA,customs and excise duty on tobacco and,39
NA,cigarettes as does a person on an income,40
NA,"of Â£5,000 or Â£10,000 per annum. The",40
NA,Opposition strongly supports the elimina-,40
NA,tion of all forms of indirect taxation. It,40
NA,believes that a direct tax should be,40
NA,imposed in the incomes of individuals and,40
NA,"companies. Therefore, although the",40
NA,Opposition will move to provide additional,40
NA,exemptions from payroll tax basically it,40
NA,believes that the tax should be eliminated,40
NA,"completely, and it will work in that",40
NA,direction.,40
NA,We have to realise that originally payroll,40
NA,tax was introduced in 1941 as part of two,40
NA,pieces of legislation introduced at that,40
NA,time. The Commonwealth Arbitration,40
NA,"Court, rather than increase the basic wage,",40
NA,recommended to the government of the,40
NA,day that a scheme of child endowment,40
NA,should be introduced. Two bills were,40
NA,introduced into the Parliament at the one,40
NA,time. One was to provide for the payment,40
NA,"of child endowment, the other was to levy",40
NA,payroU tax which at that time was to,40
NA,meet the cost of child endowment. The tax,40
NA,"an.ounted to 2 i per cent, on the wages",40
NA,paid to employees in certain industries,40
NA,throughout the Commonwealth. The,40
NA,"Treasurer, in a report in payroll tax pre-",40
NA,sented to the Parliament on 17th May 1960,40
NA,said-,40
NA,"Since then, the direct connection between",40
NA,payroll tax and the financing of child endow-,40
NA,ment has for budgetary reasons been terminated.,40
NA,"In fact, thousands of people throughout",40
NA,Australia have been of the opinion that,40
NA,payroll tax is a direct tax levied to finance,40
NA,"child endowment, but on the Treasurer's",40
NA,"own say-so in that report, that purpose has",40
NA,been terminated. Payroll tax today is,40
NA,another means of raising revenue for the,40
NA,Consolidated Revenue Fund and nothing,40
NA,"else, It is in order, therefore, to advocate",40
NA,the abolition of payroll tax and to suggest,40
NA,that a direct form of taxation be substituted.,40
NA,The organisations at present exempted,40
NA,from payroll tax are set out in the FortyFourth,40
NA,Fourth Report of the Commisssioner of,40
NA,Taxation. At page 81 under the heading Authority,40
NA,"*' Payroll Tax "" the Commissioner said-",40
NA,A feature of the legislation is the wide,40
NA,of the tax. Exemptions are limited to wages,40
NA,paid by the Governor-General or the Governor,40
NA,"of a State, the representatives in Australia of",40
NA,"the Governments of other countries, public",40
NA,"hospitals and certain other hospitals, public",40
NA,benevolent and religious institutions and a few,40
NA,specified organisations such as the South Pacific,40
NA,Commission. Wages paid to members of the,40
NA,Defence Force and certain ancillary services are,40
NA,also exempt.,40
NA,If it is possible to exempt all of those,40
NA,"organisations, and the salaries paid to mem-",40
NA,bers of the Defence Forces and other ancil-,40
NA,"lary services, why cannot local government",40
NA,authorities be exempted? Why should we,40
NA,not exclude all State Government instru-,40
NA,mentalities from the payment of this tax?,40
NA,Commonwealth Railways is exempted. Why,40
NA,should State railways pay payroll tax and,40
NA,Commonwealth Railways be. exempted? Per,40
NA,favour of a question asked by Senator,40
NA,"MCClelland in another place, a reply was",40
NA,furnished giving the amount of payroll tax,40
NA,paid by State railways throughout Australia,40
NA,during the year 1963-64. It amounted to,40
NA,"Â£3,427,864. Why? I ask honorable members",40
NA,opposite that question. I ask any Govern-,40
NA,ment supporter to give some explanation,40
NA,why State railways should be required to pay,40
NA,payroll tax when Commonwealth Railways,40
NA,is completely exempted from the payment,40
NA,of such a tax. The two instrumentalities,40
NA,perform identical work. There is no differ-,40
NA,"ence between Commonwealth Railways, the",40
NA,"New South Wales Railways, the Victorian",40
NA,Railways or the South Australian Railways.,40
NA,Mr Crean -The y are often carrying the,40
NA,same goods.,40
Mr JONES ,"Tha t is correct, ln South",40
NA,Australia the South Australian Railways,40
NA,and the Commonwealth Railways operate,40
NA,together. In Western Australia the two,40
NA,"systems perform the same duties, operating",40
NA,alongside each other. One system has to,40
NA,pay payroll tax and the other one is com-,40
NA,pletely exempted. There is no justification,40
NA,for this haphazard treatment.,40
NA,In order to show the burden imposed on,40
NA,State Governments by payroll tax I refer to,40
NA,"page 152 of "" Taxation Statistics 1963-64 """,40
NA,which are the latest figures available. The,40
NA,statistics are a supplement to the Forty-,40
NA,Report of the Commissioner of Taxa-,40
NA,"tion. I refer to the column headed "" Public",40
NA,"Activities (n.e.i.)"". As the honor-",40
NA,"able member for Melbourne Ports told us,",40
NA,"scope "" n.e.i."" means "" not elsewhere included "".",40
NA,In this column we have the salaries and,40
NA,wages paid by payroll taxpayers for each,40
NA,month of the financial year 1963-64. The,40
NA,total amount paid during the year was Â£427,40
NA,"million, which on the basis of 2 i per cent,",41
NA,means that these authorities paid Â£10.6,41
NA,million in payroll tax for 1963-64. It is,41
NA,obviously impossible for the payment of this,41
NA,tax not to have had some effect on the total,41
NA,price structure and the cost of operating,41
NA,these public authorities throughout Australia.,41
NA,Another column on the same page is headed,41
NA,"""Electricity, Gas, Water and Sanitary Ser-",41
NA,"vices"". The total amount paid in wages",41
NA,"under that heading was Â£140 million, which",41
NA,represents approximately Â£3.5 million paid,41
NA,in payroll tax. What does this Â£3.5 million,41
NA,really mean when related to the cost of,41
NA,"electricity, gas, water and sanitary services?",41
NA,I am sure honorable members on the,41
NA,Government side have received representa-,41
NA,tions and complaints from various organisa-,41
NA,tions and people in their electorates com-,41
NA,plaining that they have been unable to get,41
NA,"sewerage, or that there are inadequate sup-",41
NA,"plies of electricity, water or gas. Some",41
NA,people want gas as well as electricity but,41
NA,they cannot get it because the local authority,41
NA,has not sufficientfinanceto carry out the,41
NA,reticulation required. I am certain that,41
NA,complaints have been received in other elec-,41
NA,torates as well as mine. Continual requests,41
NA,are made for these amenities to be provided.,41
NA,If this tax were removed it would make it,41
NA,much easier for authorities to provide these,41
NA,amenities.,41
NA,Figures available indicate that a sum of,41
NA,Â£14.1 million is paid in payroll tax by State,41
NA,Government authorities. I believe that that,41
NA,"could be eliminated completely. I admit, as",41
NA,the Treasurer has said on previous occa-,41
NA,"sions, that if payroll tax were abolished",41
NA,there would have to be a readjustment of,41
NA,State tax reimbursements. So what? What if,41
NA,there had to be a readjustment of reimburse-,41
NA,ments by the Commonwealth to the States?,41
NA,It would stop the stupid-an d I emphasise,41
NA,"the word ""stupid""-arrangemen t between",41
NA,the States and the Commonwealth whereby,41
NA,we have a government taxing governments.,41
NA,How silly can we get? How long can we,41
NA,continue this stupid process of government,41
NA,taxing government. The bookwork must be,41
NA,eliminated. That is what has to be done.,41
NA,The administrative costs must be eliminated.,41
NA,The whole burden of collecting this tax is,41
NA,placed on the various government instru-,41
NA,mentalities which have to pay the tax. I am,41
NA,certain of one thing. It is that the saving,41
NA,of a considerable amount of money-n o,41
NA,one can assess the exact amount-woul d,41
NA,result from the elimination of this tax. At,41
NA,least a saving would be reflected in the,41
NA,general price structure of the country as a,41
NA,whole. The Minister for the Army (Dr,41
NA,"Forbes), who assists the Treasurer, gives",41
NA,that as one of his weak old reasons why,41
NA,the elimination of payroll tax could not be,41
NA,agreed to.,41
NA,I want to deal with local government.,41
NA,The amendment that the Opposition has,41
NA,foreshadowed is an important one. If honor-,41
NA,able members examinefigureswith regard to,41
NA,local government they will see that the,41
NA,reasons why payroll tax should be elimi-,41
NA,nated are perfectly clear. To give an,41
NA,"example, I mention that New South Wales",41
NA,"local governments employ 43,000 people.",41
NA,These local governments pay by way of,41
NA,payroll tax Â£1.3 million per annum.,41
NA,Throughout Australia payroll tax paid by,41
NA,local government amounts to Â£2.6 million.,41
NA,Let us look at another aspect of this matter.,41
NA,Local government has to pay payroll tax,41
NA,these to the Commonwealth. Does the Common-,41
NA,wealth reciprocate and pay to local authori-,41
NA,ties rates on its properties in municipal,41
NA,council areas? Of course it does not. The,41
NA,revenue lost to local government through,41
NA,"non-ratable property in 1960 was Â£722,000.",41
NA,In 1965 the figure will be approximately,41
NA,"Â£1,100,000. The 1965 figure is an approxi-",41
NA,mate one but the 1960figureis the factual,41
NA,figure of the loss of rates to local govern-,41
NA,ment because the Federal Government re-,41
NA,fuses to pay rates with respect to its various,41
NA,"instrumentalities such as post offices, custom",41
NA,houses and numerous other Commonwealth,41
NA,properties. We know that the Common-,41
NA,wealth Banking Corporation pays rates.,41
NA,There is another question I want to raise.,41
NA,The Minister for the Army said earlier,41
NA,today that no rates were paid by the Com-,41
NA,monwealth Government to water and,41
NA,severage authorities in South Aus-,41
NA,tralia. I want to say to the Ministar,41
NA,"that in Newcastle, on information",41
NA,"given to me this afternoon, the Common-",41
NA,wealth Government makes an ex gratia pay-,41
NA,ment which is the equivalent of water board,41
NA,"rates on Commonwealth properties. So,",41
NA,some justification exists for local govern-,41
NA,"ment insisting on, requiring and expecting",41
NA,the Commonwealth to make some ex gratia,41
NA,payment on its properties. That is a fair,41
NA,and a reasonable proposition. The honorable,42
NA,niember for Grey ( Mr Mortimer) has out-,42
NA,lined what has taken place in his electorate,42
NA,as far as local government is concerned. In,42
NA,"my own electorate of Newcastle, the City",42
NA,"Council pays Â£27,000 a year in payroll tax.",42
NA,"The Council loses Â£25,000 per annum on",42
NA,non-ratable Commonwealth property in the,42
NA,"municipality of Newcastle. In other words,",42
NA,"the Commonwealth Government, by impos-",42
NA,ing this tax and failing to pay rates on the,42
NA,"land it uses, is costing the ratepayers of",42
NA,"Newcastle Â£52,000 a year or approximately",42
NA,one sixth of a penny in the pound. So I,42
NA,think that the elimination of payroll tax is,42
NA,one way in which the Government can make,42
NA,a contribution to local government. Some,42
NA,positive assistance to loaal government by,42
NA,the Australian Government is long overdue.,42
NA,Local government bodies do not receive,42
NA,enough assistance. I believe that the day is,42
NA,not far distant when the Commonwealth,42
NA,Government will. have to devise some,42
NA,scheme with State and municipal govern-,42
NA,ments whereby a certain amount of income,42
NA,tax and company tax will be set aside and,42
NA,paid to local government possibly on the,42
NA,basis of so much per head of population.,42
NA,Local government authorities today are,42
NA,being required to carry out undertakings,42
NA,that they were not expected to carry out,42
NA,in years gone by. Their undertakings are,42
NA,just too numerous to go into. I believe it,42
NA,is time that the Federal Government and,42
NA,the State Governments gave much more,42
NA,assistance to local government than what,42
NA,they have been doing. This can be done in,42
NA,a practical way in the manner in which I,42
NA,have suggested. If the necessity for the,42
NA,Newcastle City Council to pay payroll tax,42
NA,"were eliminated, the result would be that",42
NA,"the Council would gain Â£27,000 per annum.",42
NA,If the Commonwealth were to pay rates on,42
NA,"its properties in Newcastle, the City Council",42
NA,"would gain immediately Â£25,000 per annum.",42
NA,In respect of these two matters the Council,42
NA,"would gain Â£52,000. This, in itself, would",42
NA,be of great assistance to the Council. The,42
NA,honorable member for Grey listed all the,42
NA,things that should be done for the councils,42
NA,"in his electorate. Those councils, too, could",42
NA,be assisted if the requirement to pay payroll,42
NA,tax was eliminated and the Commonwealth,42
NA,paid rates on its land in those council,42
NA,There is no justification for the Common-,42
NA,wealth imposing payroll tax on local govern-,42
NA,ment. The New South Wales Government,42
NA,does not charge local authorities stamp duty;,42
NA,nor does it require them to pay land tax. I f,42
NA,the New South Wales Government can see,42
NA,its way clear to exclude local government,42
NA,"from the payment of those two taxes, the",42
NA,Commonwealth should be able to exempt,42
NA,local authorities from the obligation to pay,42
NA,payroll tax.,42
NA,There is one other matter with which I,42
NA,would like to deal. I would like to hear,42
NA,some members of the Country Party say,42
NA,something on this point. I am sorry that,42
NA,the honorable member for Mallee ( Mr.,42
NA,"Turnbull) is not here, because I am certain",42
NA,"that if he were, he would have something to",42
NA,say on it. He would accept my challenge.,42
NA,I noticed a short time ago that the Minister,42
NA,for the Interior ( Mr Anthony) was in the,42
NA,chamber. But I can see that his time has,42
NA,expired and he has had to retire. I want to,42
NA,deal with the application of payroll tax to,42
NA,assist in the decentralisation of industry. We,42
NA,hear a lot about this subject from time to,42
NA,"time, particularly from Country Party mem-",42
NA,bers. I bring to the notice of honorable,42
NA,members that some months ago the honor-,42
NA,able member for Bendigo ( Mr Beaton),42
NA,proposed a motion in which he advocated,42
NA,the appointment of a joint parliamentary,42
NA,committee to deal with decentralisation and,42
NA,to endeavour to find some practical solution,42
NA,to the decentralisation of industry in Austra-,42
NA,lia. But I notice also that on 29th April,42
NA,"1965, the day the motion was submitted, the",42
NA,Minister for the Interior was speaking when,42
NA,"the debate was interrupted, as the time for",42
NA,discussion had expired. The Minister was,42
NA,granted leave to continue his speech when,42
NA,the debate was resumed. The Minister is a,42
NA,"member of the Country Party, which is",42
NA,continually advocating decentralisation. He,42
NA,is also one of the people in that party who,42
NA,have done nothing about decentralisation.,42
NA,The Country Party has been the junior,42
NA,partner of this Government for the past 16,42
NA,years. Yet we have not seen any progress,42
NA,whatsoever towards decentralisation. When-,42
NA,ever any member of the Opposition brings,42
NA,forward a resolution dealing with decen-,42
NA,"tralisation, the Government permits a",42
NA,debate on it in the initial stages but we can,42
NA,areas. never have a vote on i t,42
NA,I refer in particular to the motion moved,43
NA,by the honorable member for Bendigo.,43
NA,Paragraph (4) (b) (ii) provides-,43
NA,Tliat this House notes with grave concern-,43
NA,(4) That more than one-third of the total,43
NA,population of Australia is centred in Sydney and,43
NA,"Melbourne, and recommends to the Government as",43
NA,a matter of extreme urgency in the interests of,43
NA,balanced development and defence that-,43
NA,(b) the committee make recommendations in,43
NA,regard to-,43
NA,"(ii) concessions in individual, com-",43
NA,This paragraph proposes the use of taxation,43
NA,lo assist the decentralisation of industry. We,43
NA,have in Australia two zones in which taxa-,43
NA,tion allowances are granted to residents.,43
NA,Zone A takes in the northern half of,43
NA,"Western Australia, the Northern Territory",43
NA,and a slice of northern and western Queens-,43
NA,land. Anybody residing in Zone A is entitled,43
NA,to claim an allowance of Â£270 plus half the,43
NA,dependant's allowance. People living in Zone,43
NA,B are entitled to claim Â£45 plus one-twelfth,43
NA,of the dependant's allowance. What is wrong,43
NA,with using this form of incentive to,43
NA,encourage industries to leave capital cities,43
NA,and thus assist in decentralisation? Could,43
NA,we not introduce some system under which,43
NA,firms would be exempted from the payment,43
NA,of payroll tax if they establish new industries,43
NA,"at least, say, one hundred miles from any",43
NA,capital cities? We could lay down definite,43
NA,and positive zones so that firms establishing,43
NA,industries in those zones could claim,43
NA,exemption from the payment of the whole,43
NA,or portion of the payroll tax normally pay-,43
NA,able. In 1962-63 exporters enjoyed the,43
NA,benefit of a reduction in payroll tax to the,43
NA,"extent of Â£2,685,000. If we can make this",43
NA,"concession to encourage exports, why can",43
NA,we not do something similar to encourage,43
NA,decentralisation of industry?,43
NA,I would like some members of the,43
NA,Country Party to rise and say why this,43
NA,form of taxation concession should not be,43
NA,used to encourage decentralisation. I would,43
NA,"like them to tell us what their Party, which",43
NA,forms the junior partner in the Govern-,43
NA,"ment, is doing to bring about decentralisa-",43
NA,tion of industry. I know as well as they do,43
NA,that they are very much opposed to decen-,43
NA,tralisation of industry because they realise,43
NA,that the moment industries move into their,43
NA,electorates their seats in the Parliament will,43
NA,be in jeopardy. I have always been of the,43
NA,opinion that it is sheer humbug and hypo-,43
NA,cracy on their part to advocate decen-,43
NA,tralisation of industry. I ask honorable,43
NA,members of the Country Party to rise and,43
NA,tell us their views on this matter. I am very,43
NA,pleased to see that the honorable member,43
NA,for Mallee is with us.,43
NA,Mr Turnbull -Wh y do you always,43
NA,pick on me?,43
NA,"pany, sales or other taxation",43
Mr JONES ,-Th e honorable member,43
NA,for Mallee is the only member of the,43
NA,"Country Party, in my experience in this",43
NA,"Parliament, who has been prepared to rise",43
NA,in his place when a member on this side,43
NA,has made an attack on his Parly. I would,43
NA,like to hear what he has to say as to why,43
NA,a payroll tax concession should not be used,43
NA,as a means of encouraging industries to,43
NA,move out of the capital cities and into the,43
NA,country areas where they would provide,43
NA,employment for country people and assist,43
NA,in the development of so many of our,43
NA,country cities that need new industries. I,43
NA,ask the honorable member for Mallee and,43
NA,his colleagues of the Country Party whether,43
NA,they will support the Labour Party in hav-,43
NA,ing the motion of the honorable member,43
NA,for Bendigo on decentralisation brought on,43
NA,for discussion. It is item No. 6 under the,43
NA,"heading "" General Business"". I ask them",43
NA,"to tell us, secondly, whether they are pre-",43
NA,pared to support us in a move to have pay-,43
NA,roll tax concessions granted as an incentive,43
NA,for industry to move out of the capital,43
NA,cities. I also ask Government members to,43
NA,say why local government authorities should,43
NA,not be given the financial assistance that,43
NA,they would receive if the amendment that,43
NA,will be moved by the honorable member,43
NA,for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Crean) in the,43
NA,Committee stage were accepted.,43
NA,I support the Bill. I believe it is a step,43
NA,in the right direction to assist export,43
NA,industries. I agree with the proposal to in-,43
NA,clude the War Graves Commission as one,43
NA,of the exempted bodies. But I ask Govern-,43
NA,ment members to support the amendment,43
NA,that will be moved by the Opposition to,43
NA,include local government authorities and,43
NA,similar instrumentalities as bodies eligible,43
NA,for exemption from this iniquitous form of,43
NA,taxation.,43
Mr LUCHETTI ,Macquarie) [5.29] -,44
NA,This Bill seeks to amend the Payroll Tax,44
NA,Act 1941-63. The debate gives me an oppor-,44
NA,tunity to speak for the harried and over-,44
NA,burdened ratepayers of Australia. Many of,44
NA,them are pensioners who are ineligible for,44
NA,supplementary assistance and are in a serious,44
NA,financial position. It is necessary for us to,44
NA,consider the Bill from this broad standpoint:,44
NA,What does it propose to do? That has been,44
NA,discussed in detail by the honorable mem-,44
NA,"ber for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Crean), who",44
NA,analysed the legislation and its ramifications.,44
NA,We must also ask: How will it affect the,44
NA,economy?,44
NA,1 should like to begin by indicating my,44
NA,support for the amendment which has been,44
NA,foreshadowed by the honorable member for,44
NA,Melbourne Ports and to express the hope,44
NA,that in this debate the Parliament will,44
NA,receive a message from the Opposition,44
NA,affirming the need to relieve ratepayers and,44
NA,local government authorities of the require-,44
NA,ment to pay payroll tax in respect of work,44
NA,of very great importance to this nation. I,44
NA,have been looking through a booklet en-,44
NA,"titled ""Taxation Statistics 1963-64"" and I",44
NA,have discovered that in that year all the,44
NA,public authorities in Australia paid wages,44
NA,"amounting to Â£427,116,000. The payroll tax",44
NA,collected for the year amounted to,44
NA,"Â£68,221,735, or 5.7 per cent, of the total",44
NA,taxes paid during the year. The payroll tax,44
NA,"paid by local government authorities is,",44
NA,"therefore, really a small item. It represents",44
NA,a very meagre proportion of the total amount,44
NA,paid by taxpayers throughout Australia.,44
NA,I agree with the honorable member for,44
NA,Newcastle ( Mr Jones) that this is an,44
NA,iniquitous and unjust tax. It bears harshly,44
NA,upon people already carrying heavy burdens.,44
NA,"There is no better system, to my mind, of",44
NA,imposing taxation than by a graduated scale,44
NA,of income tax which falls on all the people.,44
NA,The booklet to which I have referred tells,44
NA,us that 854 returns were furnished by public,44
NA,"authorities for the year 1963-64, covering",44
NA,"337,342 wage and salary earners. On",44
NA,"examination it will be found, as I have",44
NA,"already said, that the amount of payroll tax",44
NA,"involved is quite small, and I am sure the",44
NA,Commonwealth Government could devise,44
NA,some other satisfactory means of obtaining,44
NA,the revenue. The total number of groups,44
NA,which furnished returns in that year was,44
NA,"38,234, of which, as I said a moment ago,",44
NA,854 were public authorities. The amount of,44
NA,"money involved is small, the field to be con-",44
NA,sidered is a broad one and the payroll tax,44
NA,does not meet modern requirements for the,44
NA,collection of necessary government finance.,44
NA,"I have already said that there were 337,342",44
NA,wage and salary earners employed by local,44
NA,government authorities in 1963-64. Of these,44
NA,"250,680 were males and 86,662 were",44
NA,females.,44
NA,I wholeheartedly support the honorable,44
NA,member for Grey ( Mr Mortimer) the honor-,44
NA,able member for Newcastle and the honor-,44
NA,able member for Melbourne Ports in their,44
NA,"contention that the payroll tax, as a means",44
NA,"of collecting necessary revenues, is un-.",44
NA,"desirable, unjust and wrong. It is time the",44
NA,Government departed from its piecemeal,44
NA,approach to this matter and arranged for,44
NA,a re-assessment of the whole situation to see,44
NA,what can be done. If the Government feels,44
NA,that it is necessary to include the War,44
NA,Graves Commission as one of the exempted,44
NA,bodies-an d we wholeheartedly agree-an d,44
NA,that it is necessary to relieve the burden on,44
NA,the motor vehicle industry so that it may,44
NA,actively engage in world competition and,44
NA,"promote our export drive, then surely it",44
NA,should accept the proposition that payroll,44
NA,tax should be completely removed in the,44
NA,interests of stimulating the entire economy.,44
NA,If it is good for the motor vehicle industry,44
NA,then surely it would be good for the whole,44
NA,community. It is about time the Government,44
NA,looked at this matter seriously to see how,44
NA,far it can go along the road I have suggested.,44
NA,The honorable member for Newcastle has,44
NA,dealt with the subject of decentralisation and,44
NA,what might be accomplished in this direction,44
NA,by payroll tax concessions. If such conces-,44
NA,sions are sound for the purpose of promot-,44
NA,"ing exports, then surely they are also sound",44
NA,for the purpose of developing industries in,44
NA,"country districts, industries that must meet",44
NA,greatly increased costs for such services as,44
NA,telephones and the transport of raw,44
NA,materials to factories and of manufactured,44
NA,products from factories to markets. So I,44
NA,say to the Government this afternoon that if,44
NA,it professes to think of the value of the,44
NA,rebate of payroll tax for export promotion,44
NA,it ought to promote decentralisation by lift-,44
NA,ing this tax in country areas. The Govern-,44
NA,ment ought to deal with the problems of,44
NA,expanding industries in country centres.,44
NA,There is neither time nor opportunity to,44
NA,discuss this aspect of the payroll tax prob-,45
NA,lem this afternoon since it does not con-,45
NA,form to the broad principles of the measure,45
NA,that we are considering.,45
NA,"Mr Speaker, all honorable members know",45
NA,the great problems that face our country,45
NA,cities and towns today in building up their,45
NA,population and even in maintaining their,45
NA,existing population. I believe that if the,45
NA,lifting of the payroll tax would achieve what,45
NA,the Government professes to hope for in,45
NA,"terms of decentralisation, we ought to go to",45
NA,the full distance in stimulating industry in,45
NA,country districts and repeal this tax insofar,45
NA,as it affects decentralised industries in the,45
NA,Australian hinterland. We ought to promote,45
NA,"the development of our country centres, and",45
NA,this is one way in which the national,45
NA,Parliament undoubtedly could help to,45
NA,encourage the establishment of industries,45
NA,in country centres. Frequently we hear in,45
NA,this chamber from the Minister for National,45
NA,Development ( Mr Fairbairn) and the Minis-,45
NA,ter for Trade and Industry ( Mr MCEwen),45
NA,expressions of the Government's interest in,45
NA,decentralisation. But Ministers have never,45
NA,matched their brave words with the actions,45
NA,that are necessary.,45
NA,I have in my hand a cutting from the issue,45
NA,"of 2nd December 1965 of the ""Sydney",45
NA,"Morning Herald ""- a very important pub-",45
NA,lication. This cutting contains a diagram,45
NA,which has been prepared by an electronic,45
NA,computer and which shows the area of,45
NA,"damage, in varying degrees, that would",45
NA,result in the Sydney metropolitan area if a,45
NA,hydrogen bomb of one megaton power were,45
NA,detonated in Martin Place. A vast area,45
NA,would be devastated and atomic fallout,45
NA,would occur over an even wider area. This,45
NA,diagram shows the destruction and damage,45
NA,that would occur in the great hub of the,45
NA,industrial and commercial life of our nation.,45
NA,I emphasise that this diagram has been pre-,45
NA,pared not by human hands but by an elec-,45
NA,tronic computer. Surely this indicates the,45
NA,urgency of the need for action today. It is,45
NA,"known, Mr Speaker, that a submarine out",45
NA,to sea could fire projectiles at any of the,45
NA,centres on our coastline. One submarine,45
NA,could cause widespread destruction and,45
NA,chaos and bring ruin to our countryside.,45
NA,I suggest this afternoon that this matter,45
NA,ought to be carefully examined by the,45
NA,Prime Minister ( Sir Robert Menzies) and,45
NA,everybody else concerned. The payroll tax,45
NA,is an irritating burden on local government,45
NA,authorities. It represents a charge upon the,45
NA,"ratepayers. Indeed, to them it really repre-",45
NA,sents a tax upon a tax. Insofar as it is of,45
NA,this character it is an evil. This evil ought,45
NA,to be removed. The Australian Government,45
NA,has failed to acknowledge the role of local,45
NA,government and the work that it does,45
NA,throughout this country. This Government,45
NA,refuses to recognise the importance of local,45
NA,government by entering into a partnership of,45
NA,government. Repeatedly honorable members,45
NA,on this side of the Parliament have sub-,45
NA,mitted pleas for the holding of a conference,45
NA,between representatives of the Common-,45
NA,wealth and the State Governments and local,45
NA,authorities for the purpose of considering,45
NA,the respective spheres of influence and func-,45
NA,tions and responsibilities so that each section,45
NA,of government may perform its rightful task,45
NA,in the development of this country. The,45
NA,Commonwealth has repeatedly refused to,45
NA,take part in such discussions.,45
NA,"City, municipal and shire councils, in the",45
NA,"discharge of their functions, are invariably",45
NA,concerned with national objectives. Councils,45
NA,provide many services for the Common-,45
NA,wealth. We have heard the honorahle mem-,45
NA,ber for Herbert ( Mr Harding) describe the,45
NA,great work that is going on in the Towns-,45
NA,ville area as a result of the new flood of,45
NA,servicemen who quite properly are going,45
NA,north for the defence of Australia. As a con-,45
NA,"sequence, new and important tasks and",45
NA,responsibilities have been imposed on local,45
NA,authorities in the Townsville area. This,45
NA,means that the local ratepayers are obliged,45
NA,to submit to heavy rating for the purpose of,45
NA,providing amenities and services. In addi-,45
NA,"tion, they are compelled to pay payroll tax",45
NA,on the money expended on wages for this,45
NA,work. This is the sort of thing that happens,45
NA,all the time. Recently the honorable member,45
NA,for Newcastle in a question that he asked,45
NA,in this chamber directed attention to the,45
NA,need for a new aerodrome to serve the New-,45
NA,castle area. He pointed out that the burden,45
NA,of providing it would inevitably fall on the,45
NA,local ratepayers in the area administered by,45
NA,the Newcastle City Council because the,45
NA,Commonwealth Government had refused to,45
NA,accept its responsibility for providing a,45
NA,much needed aerodrome to serve the area.,45
NA,What are the services and amenities which,45
NA,are provided by local authorities and the,45
NA,cost of which represents a heavy burden,45
NA,"on local citizens? Water supplies, sewerage,",46
NA,"roads, streets, parks, playgrounds, halls,",46
NA,"community centres, libraries, health services",46
NA,and the like all are needed increasingly as a,46
NA,result of the flood of migrants to Australia.,46
NA,"Furthermore, for some time councils have",46
NA,been engaged on the construction of homes,46
NA,and on land development needed for fac-,46
NA,tories to establish new industries in the,46
NA,campaign for decentralisation. All this rep-,46
NA,resents development work in country centres,46
NA,and rural areas. Surely the Commonwealth,46
NA,has a responsibility at least for ensuring,46
NA,"that councils, which are engaged on impor-",46
NA,"tant work for the nation, should not be",46
NA,subjected to a burden such as that to which,46
NA,they are subjected by the imposition of,46
NA,payroll tax. If this Government did the right,46
NA,"thing it would accept its responsibility, re-",46
NA,lieve councils of the burden of payroll tax,46
NA,and itself undertake many of the works,46
NA,carried out by councils since those works,46
NA,are essential to the progress and develop-,46
NA,ment of Australia and the expansion of,46
NA,our nation. If they were not undertaken by,46
NA,councils the Commonwealth would be,46
NA,obliged to undertake them just as it is,46
NA,obliged to undertake in this National Capital,46
NA,and in its own Territories work of the kind,46
NA,undertaken elsewhere by councils.,46
NA,The Commonwealth does a grievous,46
NA,wrong to councils. It spends money ob-,46
NA,tained direcdy from the Australian tax-,46
NA,payers. Yet it obliges local authorities to,46
NA,borrow and to pay interest on their borrow-,46
NA,ings in order to meet their commitments,46
NA,while at the same time they are also re-,46
NA,quired to pay payroll tax. The Common-,46
NA,wealth refuses to do anything to help coun-,46
NA,cils to discharge their obligations. This sort,46
NA,of situation does not make sense and the,46
NA,sooner it is corrected the better. The fact,46
NA,that the Commonwealth in its own Terri-,46
NA,tories incurs expenditure on services such,46
NA,as are provided elsewhere by councils em-,46
NA,phasises the need for early attention to be,46
NA,given to the matter. The tax burden imposed,46
NA,on local authorities is growing all the time.,46
NA,"Councillor J. M. Smith, President of the",46
NA,"Shires Association of New South Wales, in",46
NA,broadcast No. 722 made on behalf of that,46
NA,"Association, said-",46
NA,Investigation has shown that since 1947 rates,46
NA,have increased by no less than 550 per cent.,46
NA,tbe same period the wholesale price index has,46
NA,by 149 per cent. This means that after allowing,46
NA,F.14706/65 -R -[135 ],46
NA,"higher costs due to depreciated money values,",46
NA,Councils have been forced-i n order to meet their,46
NA,obligations-t o raise their rates by no less than,46
NA,"160 per cent, beyond this point per head of",46
NA,population.,46
NA,This indicates the burden imposed on the,46
NA,people in our communities as the result of,46
NA,paying their rates to local councils. Recently,46
NA,in New South Wales local government elec-,46
NA,tions were held and many a good alderman,46
NA,and many a good councillor perhaps suf-,46
NA,fered a defeat because he had been obliged,46
NA,to increase rates in his area. The responsi-,46
NA,bility ought to have been sheeted back to,46
NA,the National Parliament for failing to accept,46
NA,its responsibility in this field. The great work,46
NA,of our councils is emphasised in the periodic,46
NA,broadcasts of the Local Government Asso-,46
NA,ciation. In broadcast 811 the speaker was,46
NA,"Alderman A. E. Shaw, President of the",46
NA,Local Government Association of New,46
NA,South Wales. He pointed to the great,46
NA,development in the Lismore area and men-,46
NA,tioned that the city of Lismore won the,46
NA,"local government prize, the A. R. Bluett",46
NA,"Memorial Award, for its great work. He",46
NA,said-,46
NA,During 1964 the Lismore City Hall was com-,46
NA,pleted. The building consists of two levels-on e,46
NA,occupied by the main auditorium capable of seating,46
NA,"1,000 people and the other consisting of three",46
NA,smaller auditoriums with all modern associated,46
NA,"facilities. It cost Â£177,500-finance d entirely from",46
NA,loan funds. Thus the people of Lismore are now,46
NA,amply provided for by way of entertainment and,46
NA,cultural activities of all kinds. Two baby health,46
NA,centres,46
NA,That is building up the nation-,46
NA,"of modern design, fully equipped, were also pro-",46
NA,vided-on e near the business centre and the other,46
NA,"at South Lismore, catering for maternal and infant",46
NA,welfare.,46
NA,"That is national work of the highest order,",46
NA,yet the payroll tax is levied on the spending,46
NA,of that money to build up this beautiful city,46
NA,and to advance this country. Tbe report of,46
NA,the broadcast continues-,46
NA,A feature of the Council's activities was the pro-,46
NA,vision made for industrial development. An area,46
NA,of 82 acres has been set aside and a substantial,46
NA,"start made with the provision of roads of access,",46
NA,"water and sewerage, and electricity. The result is an",46
NA,area ideally suited for industry in reasonable,46
NA,proximity to residential areas. . . .,46
NA,"Lithgow, Bathurst, Goulburn, Orange and",46
NA,Over all the other cities are engaged in similar,46
NA,risen work. The responsibility rests with the,46
NA,for Commonwealth Government to deal with,46
NA,this matter. The tax levied on local govern-,47
NA,ment is Â£2.6 million. This burden of Â£2.6,47
NA,million ought to be waived. It is a burden,47
NA,"which is utterly unjust and utterly unfair,",47
NA,and it is something that cannot be justified,47
NA,in any circumstances.,47
NA,When one thinks of the struggling,47
NA,councils trying to make ends meet one,47
NA,realises that the Commonwealth has a,47
NA,responsibility to review its attitude in regard,47
NA,to this matter. The responsibility of the,47
NA,Commonwealth to pay rates should be un-,47
NA,doubted and never disputed. Yet the Com-,47
NA,monwealth Government will haggle over,47
NA,making some ex gratia payment to a council,47
NA,for the purpose of carrying out its duties,47
NA,in its respective area. When the Common-,47
NA,wealth Government spends money on ser-,47
NA,"vices, no payroll tax is levied, but when",47
NA,a local authority spends money on the work,47
NA,alongside that of the Commonwealth this,47
NA,burden is imposed. I put to the House that,47
NA,the Australian Government occupies a,47
NA,privileged position. That is admitted. It has,47
NA,"the constitutional power, it has the avail-",47
NA,"able finance, it has the taxation resources,",47
NA,but it should also look with responsibility,47
NA,to other departments and organisations of,47
NA,government to see that this burden does,47
NA,not reach the breaking point at which it,47
NA,stands at the present time.,47
NA,The problem of rates is one of the most,47
NA,serious ones affecting the people of our,47
NA,country. When this legislation is finally,47
NA,"passed, if the Commonwealth Government",47
NA,refuses to accept the amendment to be,47
NA,moved subsequently by the honorable mem-,47
NA,ber for Melbourne Ports it should review,47
NA,the whole matter of the payroll tax. I have,47
NA,in my hand a letter addressed to the,47
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) by the,47
NA,Secretary of the Australian Council of Local,47
NA,Government Associations dated Hth July,47
NA,1965. The letter states-,47
NA,"As you are well aware, representations have",47
NA,been made by the Australian Council on a,47
NA,number of occasions seeking exemption of local,47
NA,authorities from the payment of payroll tax.,47
NA,"At the last meeting of the Australian Council,",47
NA,I was directed to resubmit the request for your,47
NA,further consideration.,47
NA,I have no doubt that you are well aware of,47
NA,the grounds on which local government considers,47
NA,it should be freed from the payment of this tax,47
NA,but perhaps it would be relevant to restate the,47
NA,points which motivate the Australian Council in,47
NA,making its submission.,47
NA,"These, of general consideration, are-",47
NA,(a) PayroU tax in itself in an uneconomical,47
NA,tax because it penalises the employer-,47
NA,whether governmental or private-wh o,47
NA,employs the most people.,47
NA,(b) The cost of collection of the tax is high,47
NA,in relation to the revenue received.,47
NA,(c) In 1961 the Commonwealth Government,47
NA,legislated granting rebates of the tax,47
NA,imposed on wages paid by producers,47
NA,for exports. These rebates amount to at,47
NA,least Â£2 million per annum. If this,47
NA,"can be done for exporters, it could",47
NA,"equally be applied to local government,",47
NA,which makes no profit but serves the,47
NA,community.,47
NA,Aspects peculiar to local government-,47
NA,(1) Councils draw their revenue in the,47
NA,"main from land rating. Hence,",47
NA,in calling on councils to con-,47
NA,"tribute to the Commonwealth, the",47
NA,"latter, in effect, is demanding a",47
NA,share of councils' income from,47
NA,rating. It is a tax on a tax. It is,47
NA,understood that the amount collec-,47
NA,ted by the Commonwealth in pay-,47
NA,"roll tax from local government,",47
NA,approximates Â£21 million per,47
NA,annum. This is a substantial sum,47
NA,which councils can ill afford.,47
NA,"Furthermore, this ""loss"" must",47
NA,"minimise to that extent, the works",47
NA,which may be carried out by local,47
NA,authorities.,47
NA,"(2) The Commonwealth, while levying",47
NA,"local government, is not willing to",47
NA,pay rates to local government on,47
NA,properties wbich it owns.,47
NA,(3) There is no equity in one governmental,47
NA,authority imposing burdens on,47
NA,another. It presupposes that the,47
NA,activities of councils are of a lesser,47
NA,significance than those of the Com-,47
NA,"monwealth; whereas, in fact, the",47
NA,services given by councils are basic,47
NA,to community living.,47
NA,(4) Any body-whethe r it be State or,47
NA,local government-concerne d with,47
NA,the development of the country and,47
NA,the expenditure of a large propor-,47
NA,tion of its revenue on capital de-,47
NA,"velopment, should not have to pay",47
NA,a tax on wages of labour employed,47
NA,in carrying out such works.,47
NA,The Australian Council is aware that in reject-,47
NA,"ing its claims on earlier occasions, it has been",47
NA,contended that because State Governments and,47
NA,"semi-governmental authorities have to pay tax, then",47
NA,it is logical that local government shouid do so,47
NA,also.,47
NA,"In that regard, 1 am to point out that the Com-",47
NA,monwealth directly assists the States in meeting,47
NA,their commitments but no such arrangement,47
NA,applies for local government. It is true that local,47
NA,government does get some assistance in the con-,47
NA,struction and maintenance of roads in sparsely,47
NA,"populated areas, but had it not been given, there",47
NA,would have been little hope of improving local,48
NA,roads with the limited financial resources available.,48
NA,"For the financial year 1963-64, the contribution",48
NA,by local government by way of payroll tax to the,48
NA,"coffers of the Commonwealth, amounted to",48
NA,"Â£2,600,000. This is more than double what was",48

NA,tions to local government generally.,48
NA,lt is apparent that the greater the degree of,48

NA,"(vide page 978), on motion by Mr Bury-",49
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,49
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Yarra) [8.0] -Th e,49
NA,purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs,49
NA,"Mortimer, J.",49
NA,"Nicholls, M . H .",49
NA,Tariff (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1961 to,49
NA,give power to determine or define an export,49
NA,"Pollard, R. T.",49
NA,"Reynolds, L . J.",49
NA,price where goods that are imported to,49
NA,"Australia are, in the opinion of the Minister,",49
NA,subject to reasonable grounds for believing,49
NA,that the documentary export price or other,49
NA,information provided in respect of them is,49
NA,Tellers: not adequate to determine what the price,49
NA,"Coutts, W. C.",49
NA,"Duthie, G. W. A .",49
NA,should be. When the Bill was introduced the,49
NA,Minister for Housing ( Mr Bury),49
NA,NOES. pointed out that the level of any,49
NA,"Hughes, T. E. F.",49
NA,"Irwin, L . H .",49
NA,protection granted to an economic and,49
NA,"efficient Australian industry should be based,",49
NA,"or is based, on the assumption that goods",49
NA,imported into Australia are sold by the,49
NA,exporter at a fair and reasonable price not,49
NA,"Mackay, M . G.",49
NA,"Maisey, D. W.",49
NA,below normal value. This means that the,49
NA,export price should be not less than the,49
NA,"Nixon, P. J.",49
NA,"Opperman, H . F.",49
NA,price at which the goods are available in the,49
NA,domestic market of the country of export.,49
NA,From that concept comes the concept of,49
NA,dumping. If goods are exported from one,49
NA,country to another at a price which is,49
NA,"Swartz, R. W. C.",49
NA,"Turner, H . B.",49
NA,"significantly less than that, then the practice",49
NA,is called dumping.,49
NA,The Minister has told us that it frequently,49
NA,happens that goods are sold for export at,49
NA,"Turnbull, W. G.",49
NA,"prices which, in comparison to their normal",49
NA,"values, are not fair and reasonable and",49
NA,"PAIRS, which are deliberately set at unduly low",49
NA,"Menzies, Sir Robert",49
NA,"Hasluck, P. M . C.",49
NA,levels. There could be many purposes for,49
NA,exporting conduct of this kind-t o capture,49
NA,"a market in some other country then, when",49
NA,having captured it and perhaps eliminated,49
NA,producers in that country or competitors,49
NA,"from elsewhere, to bring the price back to",49
NA,one which may give the exporter a greater,49
NA,return. It may be that a country possesses an,49
NA,"industry which is planned to expand and, in",49
NA,"the course of doing this, it may pay to sell",49
NA,the products of that industry at lower than,49
NA,what could be regarded as normal values.,49
NA,"Sometimes exporting, which can be defined",49
NA,as dumping in the manner that the Minister,50
NA,"has looked at the matter, may not, in fact,",50
NA,"be an uneconomic process, it may not be a",50
NA,deliberate one to damage or to exclude a,50
NA,"competitor, but it may be the result of the",50
NA,particular stage of development of the,50
NA,industry concerned.,50
NA,The Minister has told us that the Govern-,50
NA,ment has taken the view that dumping in,50
NA,all its forms must be countered whenever it,50
NA,damages or threatens to damage an Austra-,50
NA,lian industry. Until this amendment was,50
NA,introduced the law was that evidence was,50
NA,required from the importer or from other,50
NA,"people to endeavour to ascertain what, in",50
NA,"fact, was the normal value of the commodity",50
NA,concerned that might have been suspected,50
NA,of being dumped. For all practical purposes,50
NA,the Minister and the Department were,50
NA,limited to the evidence that was procurable.,50
NA,We have been told that a complete review,50
NA,has been made of the Act and its short-,50
NA,comings in relation to the dumping prac-,50
NA,tices that were impairing the protection to,50
NA,Australian industry. The Bill incorporates,50
NA,the result of this review.,50
NA,One clause is of special significance and,50
NA,"the rest are incidental. Thatclause, of",50
NA,"course, is clause 3. It vests in the Minister",50
NA,for Customs and Excise a power to deter-,50
NA,mine the export price of goods exported to,50
NA,"Australia where, in his opinion, there are",50
NA,reasonable grounds for believing that the,50
NA,documentary export price has been fixed,50
NA,with a view to avoiding dumping duty or,50
NA,other special duties payable in accordance,50
NA,with the provisions of the Act. The Minister,50
NA,has pointed out that this amendment has a,50
NA,wide effect. It introduces into the legislation,50
NA,an element of flexibility necessary to counter,50
NA,all the various practices that have arisen.,50
NA,The Opposition recognises that difficul-,50
NA,ties of the kind that have been described,50
NA,may arise and that the Department and the,50
NA,Minister need power to be able to deal,50
NA,"with them. But, of course, this is a very",50
NA,arbitrary power. We realise that when we,50
NA,give the Minister power we are really giving,50
NA,it to the Department. Let us be quite frank,50
NA,about this: The Minister will do what he,50
NA,is advised to do; he will not be making the,50
NA,investigations himself but he will rely upon,50
NA,and trust those who are in a position to,50
NA,advise him. We are giving a very arbitrary,50
NA,power to determine the export price of goods,50
NA,where tbe Minister is not satisfied with the,50
NA,evidence that becomes available to him. I,50
NA,emphasise to the House that this is in fact,50
NA,a very arbitrary power and one that could,50
NA,go wrong. It will have to be watched very,50
NA,carefully. A power of this sort can be,50
NA,dangerous and it should not be lightly,50
NA,given nor should it be lightly used.,50
NA,I have seen a little of this in recent years,50
NA,and I know that there are interests involved,50
NA,that do not always lead the parties con-,50
NA,cerned to act impartially. I have seen a,50
NA,number of cases where Australian manu-,50
NA,facturers have been very quick on the draw,50
NA,in respect of some competition from over-,50
NA,"seas. One feels, as I have felt from time",50
NA,"to time, that the Department is a little more",50
NA,inclined to take notice of the manufacturers,50
NA,than it is to take notice of the importers-,50
NA,who also have a considerable amount of,50
NA,capital and interest involved-whe n it,50
NA,comes to a question of deciding between one,50
NA,and the other. 1 have noticed this recently,50
NA,particularly with imports from countries,50
NA,that may not be popular with Conservative,50
NA,people in Australia. I am referring to,50
NA,countries like China and some of the Com-,50
NA,munist countries in Europe. I know from,50
NA,my own experience that importers of com-,50
NA,modities from countries like those and also,50
NA,from other countries in Europe-an d here,50
NA,I refer to West Germany in particular-,50
NA,have outlaid a considerable amount of,50
NA,"money on transactions which, from all the",50
NA,"evidence I can see, were fairly normal; but",50
NA,then there has been a suspicion that dump-,50
NA,"ing has been involved, because the process",50
NA,of costing may not have been quite the,50
NA,"same as that with which we are familiar,",50
NA,and the importer has been caught. Although,50
NA,he has priced his commodities properly and,50
NA,in some cases has actually sold them on,50
NA,the Australian market at what he regarded,50
NA,"as a genuine price, he has been told that",50
NA,he has to pay a dumping duty because,50
NA,those commodities were held to have been,50
NA,dumped.,50
NA,I have no objection to a provision of,50
NA,"this kind, and I have no objection to its",50
NA,"being used, but when an importer imports",50
NA,goods in good faith and sells them in good,50
NA,faith at a price which is determined by the,50
NA,"import price that he paid, he should not be",50
NA,required to pay a penalty if it is felt he,50
NA,has acted in good faith. In one case in,50
NA,respect of which I have made representa-,50
NA,tions in the last few weeks I find that there,50
NA,is to be a dumping duty-securitie s have,50
NA,had to be taken out-an d the man will have,51
NA,to pay up even though I think good faith,51
NA,was involved all the way through the trans-,51
NA,action. Clause 9 of the Bill provides that,51
NA,there shall be no retrospective application,51
NA,in this respect. That is an excellent,51
NA,principle. I believe that we should protect,51
NA,industry against dumping but I do not,51
NA,think we should do it retrospectively. I,51
NA,approve of the provision in clause 9 but I,51
NA,think that where securities have been held,51
NA,"in the past, in effect there has been retro-",51
NA,spective operation.,51
NA,Most of the clauses of the Bill are merely,51
NA,drafting changes embodying no variation in,51
NA,the interpretation or application of the pro-,51
NA,visions. Some of the amendments in clause 3,51
NA,are of this nature; those in clause 4 are,51
NA,"almost completely so; and clauses 5, 6, 7",51
NA,and 8 are the same. Clause 9 provides that,51
NA,amendments in the Bill are not to be applied,51
NA,retrospectively. The Bill is not therefore one,51
NA,"of great substance, although the powers",51
NA,given in clause 3 can have very wide appli-,51
NA,cation and could be exercised in a very,51
NA,arbitrary way.,51
NA,I do not intend to delay the House any,51
NA,longer on this Bill. The Opposition does not,51
NA,"oppose it, but we emphasise the extent to",51
NA,which clause 3 provides an arbitrary power,51
NA,which could be wrongly used. We emphasise,51
NA,that its application has to be watched very,51
NA,carefully.,51
Mr KELLY ,"Wakefield) [8.12] -I , too,",51
NA,give the Bill my blessing. I realise that there,51
NA,has to be effective dumping legislation. The,51
NA,need for this legislation has been brought,51
NA,out quite clearly in the Vernon Committee's,51
NA,"report, which deals with dumping at some",51
NA,length. In paragraph 14.107 the Committee,51
NA,reported-,51
NA,There is need for effective anti-dumping,51
NA,"lation, which must be regarded",51
NA,to the normal tariff-making process. The absence,51
NA,of fully effective legislation may be expected to,51
NA,"lead, and in Australia has led, to pressure for",51
NA,prohibitive or nearly-prohibitive ordinary tariffs.,51
NA,It is therefore important to review the scope for,51
NA,strengthening the existing law.,51
NA,It is clear that the Vernon Committee try,51
NA,realised that there was a need to alter,51
NA,"strengthen our dumping laws, but for one",51
NA,main reason-tha t if dumping can be preton,51
NA,vented it is possible to get duties down,51
NA,a more realistic level. It is the fear that,51
NA,"goods may be dumped that has, in some",51
NA,"cases, led industries to ask for, and somecretion.",51
NA,"times to demand, duties which, but for this,",51
NA,would appear unnecessarily high.,51
NA,It is interesting that this legislation is,51
NA,"the first fruits only, J hope, of the Vernon",51
NA,Committee's tariff recommendations. I can-,51
NA,not help but comment rather sourly that this,51
NA,is the kind of thing that we expect from the,51
NA,Government. The Government seems to be,51
NA,more -ready to erect barriers than to take,51
NA,them down. Here the Vernon Committee,51
NA,has recommended that the dumping pro-,51
NA,cedures be altered. There are a lot of things,51
NA,in the tariff chapters of the Vernon Com-,51
NA,mittee's report that I hope the Government,51
NA,is looking at with equal enthusiasm. If I,51
"may refer to them, Mr SPEAKER ",onl y in,51
NA,"passing, I assure you-the y include recom-",51
NA,mendations that the general level of tariff,51
NA,should be no higher than slightly less than,51
NA,"30 per cent, unless a higher level can be",51
NA,thoroughly justified; that industries that are,51
NA,in existence are not necessarily entitled to,51
NA,protection; that references should cease to,51
NA,shuttle backwards and forwards between the,51
NA,Special Advisory Authority and the Tariff,51
NA,Board; and that tariffs should not be used,51
NA,as a method of creating employment. These,51
NA,are the kinds of things that I urge the,51
NA,Government to look at with the same kind,51
NA,of enthusiasm that it brought to bear in,51
NA,considering this comparatively minor recom-,51
NA,mendation in the report.,51
NA,In an environment which becomes more,51
NA,complicated where the methods of evading,51
NA,dumping laws are becoming more cunning,51
NA,"and effective, there is a need for the Govern-",51
NA,ment to have effective power to deal with,51
NA,"dumping, but I am glad that the honorable",51
NA,member for Yarra (Dr JF CAIRNS) re-,51
NA,ferred to the immense power that is given,51
NA,to the Minister for Customs and Excise and,51
NA,"his Department, because they can, by a",51
NA,"legisstroke of the pen, impose or considerably",51
NA,as a supplement increase a duty.,51
NA,Let us see what we are doing. Essentially,51
NA,we are trying to stop people from selling,51
NA,things to us cheaply. This is the queer,51
NA,kind of thing that we do these days. We,51
NA,to stop people in other lands from selling,51
NA,and things to us cheaply. Suppose that the,51
NA,normal value of paper overseas is Â£100 a,51
NA,and that the actual price overseas is,51
NA,to found to be Â£90 a ton. Then the duty auto-,51
NA,matically is increased by Â£10-fro m Â£32 to,51
NA,Â£42. This is done at the Minister's dis-,51
NA,This is a considerable power to,51
NA,give to any Minister. I agree with the hon-,52
NA,orable member for Yarra that this is the,52
NA,kind of power that should be used with,52
NA,very great discretion. I am aware of the,52
NA,pressures that come from manufacturing,52
NA,industries and I was glad to hear the honor-,52
NA,able member for Yarra mention these,52
NA,"specifically, because industry seems to me",52
NA,rather too readily to take the easy way,52
NA,out. If industries are in difficulties they go,52
NA,to the Department and urge it-no t always,52
NA,successfully-t o take action against dump-,52
NA,ing. It seems to me that sometimes we must,52
NA,be rather sceptical of the grounds on which,52
NA,this dumping action is taken. This kind of,52
NA,aclion has peculiar results. We have,52
NA,recently discussed in some detail and elo-,52
NA,quence the restrictive trade practices,52
NA,"legislation, it is interesting to realise that",52
NA,relation to Scandinavian paper there is what,52
NA,"is called a "" Scan-Fin "" price ring.",52
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I point out that,52
NA,this is a limited measure. We are dealing,52
NA,with freight dumping only.,52
Mr KELLY ,"Wit h respect, we are",52
NA,dealing only with freight dumping.,52
Mr SPEAKER ,"Th e main subject that, too.",52
NA,before the Chair is legislation to counter,52
NA,freight dumping.,52
Mr KELLY ," I am sorry, but there is",52
NA,amendment which has not yet been moved.,52
Mr SPEAKER ,"Apparently , the honor-",52
NA,able member is anticipating the Committee,52
NA,stage. The amendment is not before,52
NA,House.,52
Mr KELLY ,Tha t is right. I have not,52
NA,been discussing freight dumping.,52
Mr SPEAKER , I thought the honortioned,52
NA,able member was referring to paper from,52
NA,Scandinavia.,52
Mr KELLY , I was referring to dumpin,52
NA,"ing, but freight has not been mentioned.",52
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,52
NA,ber would be very much in order if he Tariff Board,52
NA,mentioned freight.,52
Mr KELLY ,I n Scandinavia there is,52
NA,arrangement whereby a common price,52
NA,fixed for paper. The Attorney-General ( Mr.,52
NA,Snedden) would call it a restrictive trade,52
NA,practice. The Scan-Fin price becomes,52
NA,normal value when the Department of Board,52
NA,Customs and Excise looks at it. If some-,52
NA,body starts to break the ring and to sell,52
NA,"paper cheaply to Australia, the operation of",52
NA,this dumping procedure puts a stop to that,52
NA,practice. This is a queer kind of way in,52
NA,which we go about things. We are deliber-,52
NA,ately encouraging the operation of price,52
NA,rings overseas and we are bending back-,52
NA,wards to stop them here. The kind of think-,52
NA,ing has peculiar side effects. It is interesting,52
NA,"to realise that in many instances, again",52
NA,"especially with paper, there is a price for",52
NA,Australia which is about Â£3 or Â£4 a ton,52
NA,higher than the price for shipment to other,52
NA,places. This is done to ensure that dumping,52
NA,duties are not attracted. This is the queer,52
NA,kind of world in which we live. We are,52
NA,deliberately setting out to do this. It is being,52
NA,"in done with the highest of motives, but one",52
NA,cannot help feeling a little sceptical. The,52
NA,operations of the Government in this regard,52
NA,seem to be devoted to seeing that price rings,52
NA,overseas are given full rein while in Aus-,52
NA,tralia it is trying to prevent price rings from,52
NA,developing. I wonder whether we are,52
NA,not allowed to discuss freight dumping.,52
Mr SPEAKER , I began to wonder,52
Mr KELLY ," I am asking you, Sir. I",52
NA,trust that I shall be allowed to discuss it,52
NA,"an now because, if I am not, I will have to",52
NA,"speak again in the Committee stage,",52
Mr SPEAKER ,I t would be more in,52
NA,order for the honorable member to discuss,52
NA,the it in Committee when speaking to the,52
NA,amendment that has been foreshadowed.,52
Mr KELLY , I shall devote myself to it,52
NA,at that stage. I want to repeat one point.,52
NA,The honorable member for Yarra men-,52
NA,this. The Minister is given great,52
NA,"power, but it is true that the Bill, as it is",52
NA,"at present drawn, places the Tariff Board",52
NA,the position of a watchdog. At this stage,52
NA,at least a case has to go to the Tariff Board,52
NA,for inquiry. Clause 4 of the Bill provides-,52
NA,"If the Minister, after inquiry and report by the",52
NA,I will teU the House of the way that this,52
NA,"an procedure has worked in one case, and I",52
NA,is think only one case. The Tariff Board,52
NA,looked at the case in question. I think it,52
NA,dealt with kraft paper; it is in the last re-,52
NA,the port of the Tariff Board on paper. The,52
NA,said that it had been unable to find,52
NA,any evidence of dumping of kraft paper,53
NA,"taking place, but the Department of",53
NA,Customs and Excise applied dumping duties.,53
NA,I mentioned this matter in the House on a,53
NA,"previous occasion. This action may be legal,",53
NA,but it is not right. We have understood that,53
NA,this action would be taken only after the,53
NA,"Tariff Board had reported but, in this in-",53
NA,"stance, the Department took the action after",53
NA,the Tariff Board inquiry found that,53
NA,dumping was not taking place. I,53
NA,understand that this has happened only,53
NA,"once. I realise, of course, that the reports",53
NA,of the Tariff Board are not sacred; they,53
NA,can be departed from. But if they are de-,53
NA,"parted from, I think it is proper that the",53
NA,Minister should make it perfectly plain,53
NA,that the action is being taken despite the,53
NA,recommendations of the Tariff Board. I,53
NA,"repeat that, as far as I know, this hap-",53
NA,"pened on only one occasion, but I note",53
NA,with great concern that when it did hap-,53
NA,pen no statement was made by the Minister,53
NA,for Customs and Excise.,53
NA,There is another difficulty in this pro-,53
NA,"cess. When the Minister, through his De-",53
NA,"partment, thinks that dumping is taking",53
NA,"place, a notice is published in the",53
NA,""" Gazette "". This is referred to in the Bill.",53
NA,The information then becomes public,53
NA,"property. The difficulty we face is that, as",53
NA,"far as I know, the gazettals are never can-",53
NA,celled. The threat that hangs over the head,53
NA,of the importer is left hanging there. Even,53
NA,"if, after inquiry, it is found that dumping",53
NA,"is not taking place, the ""Gazette"" notice",53
NA,"still remains in force. I should think that,",53
NA,if after gazettal it is found that dumping,53
NA,"is not taking place, the proper action for",53
NA,the Department to take is to notify in the,53
NA,""" Gazette"" that these goods are not now",53
NA,under inquiry. I have discussed this matter,53
NA,with officers of the Department and I,53
NA,understand that they recognise that this,53
NA,is a weakness and they would hope to take,53
NA,this action as soon as the staff position,53
NA,allows them to do so. I hope that the,53
NA,"Minister, when replying, will give me an",53
NA,assurance that this wiil be done. I think,53
NA,he will admit that it should be done.,53
NA,"Every time we deal with tariff matters,",53
NA,we cannot help noticing the immense com-,53
NA,plexity of them. The procedure I have out-,53
NA,lined tonight is an example of the difficul-,53
NA,ties and complexities that arise. Those of,53
NA,us who remember the size of the new,53
NA,schedule dealt with under the Brussels,53
NA,amendment will be appalled at the difficulty,53
NA,of finding a way through it and of under-,53
NA,standing this Frankenstein monster that we,53
NA,have created. We created it with the best of,53
NA,"intentions, I admit, but I certainly do not",53
NA,claim to understand the monster properly.,53
NA,"Even you, Sir, I think would have some",53
NA,hesitation in saying that you understand it.,53
Mr SPEAKER , I will recognise freight,53
NA,when the honorable member comes to it.,53
Mr KELLY , I admit that the proce-,53
NA,dures we have adopted in this House have,53
NA,"helped our discussions on tariff matters,",53
NA,and I pay tribute to the Standing Orders,53
NA,Committee for the assistance they have,53
NA,"given. However, the fact remains that we",53
NA,"have, for the best possible reasons and with",53
NA,"the best intentions, created an animal that",53
NA,none of us really understands. I think we,53
NA,should make deliberate efforts to try to,53
NA,simplify the system whenever we can. With,53
NA,"due humility, I suggest we are making the",53
NA,procedures even more difficult. People feel,53
NA,that they must come to Canberra to put,53
NA,their case to the Department. I admit that,53
NA,on many occasions in the past I have been,53
NA,critical of the operations of the officers. I,53
NA,have always thought that they had an inbuilt,53
NA,bias towards erecting barriers rather than,53
NA,taking them down. I am beginning to change,53
NA,my mind. I realise now that they have a,53
NA,difficult job to do. But whichever way they,53
NA,do their job)- I know they have the best,53
NA,of intentions-th e fact remains that this is,53
NA,a complicated machine to work. Many,53
NA,"people, particularly small importers, find",53
NA,that they must come to Canberra to put,53
NA,"their case to the Department, particularly",53
NA,on dumping. It is a complicated and expen-,53
NA,sive machine to operate. I do not blame,53
NA,also anybody for this; it is the nature of the,53
NA,beast. But let us take every opportunity we,53
NA,can to try to simplify it in some way.,53
NA,"Shortly, we will introduce decimal currency.",53
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I think the hon-,53
NA,orable member is engaging in a general de-,53
NA,bate on every aspect. The subject matter,53
NA,before the Chair is freight dumping.,53
Mr KELLY ,"No , Sir, not yet. We have",53
NA,not come to it.,53
Mr SPEAKER ,Tha t is the trouble. I,53
NA,am trying to point out to the honorable,53
NA,gentleman that he is engaging in a general,54
NA,debate on tariff policy. I suggest he should,54
NA,relate his remarks to the Bill.,54
Mr KELLY ,W e have not come to,54
NA,freight yet. The Minister has not yet moved,54
NA,his amendment about freight dumping.,54
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I direct the,54
NA,attention of the honorable member to the,54
NA,"Bill. It deals with freight dumping, and",54
NA,thing that does not relate to that point,54
NA,irrelevant.,54
Mr FAIRHALL ," Mr Speaker, may 1 take",54
NA,"a point of order? With due respect to you,",54
NA,"Sir, I think some of the provisions in the",54
NA,Bill refer to other aspects of dumping and,54
NA,I would importune the Chair to give the,54
NA,honorable gentleman a little more latitude,54
NA,in his offering to the House.,54
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! I again call the,54
NA,honorable member for Wakefield.,54
Mr KELLY ," Sir , I am not canvassing",54
NA,"your ruling for one moment, but, when I",54
NA,"say that this is a complicated Bill, I",54
NA,that you will recognise by your ruling,54
NA,it is becoming increasingly complicated.,54
NA,was making a plea to have the system simposition,54
NA,plified.,54
Mr SPEAKER , I do not see any refermember,54
NA,ence to decimal currency in the Bill.,54
Mr KELLY , I thought it would be a,54
NA,useful addition to make. All I was going,54
NA,"to say in passing is that it would be useful,",54
NA,view of the fact that next year decimal,54
NA,"currency will be introduced, to measure",54
NA,dumping duties in decimal currency. We,54
NA,could then have the measurement made to that,54
NA,the nearest dollar. At present the value,54
NA,"the duty is worked out in pounds, shillings",54
NA,and pence. This seems to make things,54
NA,unnecessarily complicated. I can see more,54
NA,"virtue, not only in simplicity-whic h I",54
NA,"think is always desirable-bu t also in speed,",54
NA,"and cheapness of operation, in having",54
NA,value worked out to the nearest dollar.,54
NA,In New Zealand the value of the duty is,54
NA,worked out to the nearest pound sterling.,54
NA,To inflict an unnecessary complication,54
NA,the form of a minute money measurement,54
NA,"seems to be unnecessary, and I urge the",54
NA,Minister for Supply to pass on to the,54
NA,Minister for Customs and Excise in another,54
NA,place an urgent recommendation that,54
NA,procedure I suggest be adopted and the,54
NA,value for dumping duties be worked out,54
NA,"to the nearest dollar instead of in pounds,",54
NA,"shillings and pence as at present. That, I",54
NA,"am sure, would simplify the procedure.",54
NA,"Having said that, and having offered",54
NA,some criticism of the operation of the Bill,54
NA,"and the way the machine works, I want to",54
NA,repeat my general willingness to admit that,54
NA,anythere is need for effective dumping legisla-,54
NA,is tion. I hope that the Minister recognises,54
NA,the unusual powers placed in his hands. I,54
NA,"hope that he, through his Department, will",54
NA,continue to take action only if an allega-,54
NA,tion of dumping has been thoroughly tested,54
NA,and it is found that dumping is taking place.,54
NA,I realise that there is need to have more,54
NA,effective and manoeuvrable machinery to,54
NA,allow this to be done efficiently. I repeat,54
NA,my general plea that the machinery be,54
NA,"kept as simple as possible, recognising only",54
NA,"too clearly that even, you, Sir, are unable",54
NA,to follow its workings easily.,54
Mr FOX ,Henty) [8.33] -I t is not my,54
NA,think intention to speak for more than a few,54
NA,that minutes and I want to make only one,54
NA,I point. I find myself in a rather peculiar,54
NA,because the point I want to make,54
NA,falls within the ambit of the leniency which,54
NA,you have just extended to the honorable,54
NA,for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly). Perhaps,54
NA,I should plead guilty to collusion in this,54
NA,matter. I support him in his request to the,54
NA,Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator,54
NA,in Anderson) and the Government to consider,54
NA,altering the basis on which the value for,54
NA,duty is calculated. From the date of the,54
NA,introduction of decimal currency I suggest,54
NA,the value for duty be calculated in deci-,54
NA,"of mal currency and not in pounds, shillings",54
NA,and pence. The reason I support the honor-,54
NA,able member for Wakefield is that I have,54
NA,already written to the Minister for Customs,54
NA,and Excise (Senator Anderson) on this sub-,54
NA,ject. Up to the present I have received an,54
NA,the acknowledgment but not an answer to the,54
NA,proposition I put.,54
NA,My suggestion is that from C Day the,54
NA,value for duty should be calculated to the,54
NA,in nearest dollar. I support the honorable,54
NA,member for Wakefield's suggestion on this.,54
NA,He said that this is not a new principle,54
NA,because it already exists in New Zealand,54
NA,legislation. I have with me a page from a,54
NA,the publication issued by the New Zealand,54
NA,Government Printer. It contains an extract,55
NA,from section 114(1)(1A) of the New Zea-,55
NA,land legislation which provides-,55
NA,Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1),55
NA,"this section, where for the purposes of any",55
NA,the amount of the current domestic value is,55
NA,"quired to be shown or declared, that amount",55
NA,"be shown or declared, if it is not a whole number",55
NA,"of pounds at the nearest pound, and, if",55
NA,"number of pounds and ten shillings exactly,",55
NA,pound next below the amount.,55
NA,My suggestion is not to go as far as that,55
NA,"provision, but to take the value to the",55
NA,nearest dollar. I should like to point out that,55
NA,the advantages of such a scheme are obvious.,55
NA,"First, the calculation to be done by the",55
NA,"Department of Customs and Excise, the cretion",55
NA,importer or the customs agent would,55
NA,considerably reduced. This would result in,55
NA,a saving in time and expense by the Depart-,55
NA,"ment, the importer and the agent. Secondly,",55
NA,it would be possible to process customs,55
NA,matters much more quickly and it would Tariff,55
NA,be a simple matter to carry out the calculaaction,55
NA,tions necessary to convert the value of,55
NA,foreign currencies to Australian dollars,55
NA,also to make a simple calculation of the,55
NA,amount of duty payable.,55
NA,"Finally, I should like to say that, if",55
NA,"suggestion is adopted, from a revenue point",55
NA,"of view the effect would be negligible,",55
NA,cause for amounts up to 49 cents the addithat,55
NA,tional cents would be disregarded and for discretion.,55
NA,amounts between 50 and 99 cents an extra,55
NA,dollar would be added. What was added in,55
NA,some cases would cancel out what was directed,55
NA,taken out in others. The greatest variation,55
NA,"would be 49 cents, which is equal to 4s.",55
NA,so the revenue would be affected by only,55
NA,"small amount, because I believe that most",55
NA,"duties fall within the range of 7Â± per cent,",55
NA,to 55 per cent. I am a believer in simplifiMinister.,55
NA,"cation and common sense, and I hope that",55
NA,the Minister and the Government will give,55
NA,this matter earnest consideration.,55
Mr FAIRHALL ,Paterson-Ministe r for,55
NA,Supply) [8.36] -Tb e Government is glad,55
NA,have the support of the Opposition for,55
NA,"Bill before the House. Indeed, we could",55
NA,hardly expect the Bill not to have the supdetails,55
NA,"port of the House, since both sides of the",55
NA,Parliament are singularly devoted to,55
NA,"machinery for the protection, strengthening",55
NA,and growth of Australian industry. Both,55
NA,honorable member for Yarra (Dr J. F.,55
NA,Cairns) and the honorable member for,55
NA,Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) have directed atteninjury,55
NA,tion to the rather extensive arbitrary power.?,55
NA,placed in the hands of the Minister for,55
NA,Customs and Excise (Senator Anderson) by,55
NA,ot this Bill. I can only say to the honorable,55
NA,entry gentlemen that since in this modern world,55
NA,rethe spirit of the smuggler is still abroad in,55
NA,shall industrial circles we find every measure by,55
NA,it is a the Government is met by a counter,55
NA,at the measure from traders anxious to get their,55
NA,goods on to our markets. Where the tech-,55
NA,niques of avoiding customs duties have,55
NA,become vastly more sophisticated it becomes,55
NA,a general battle of wits and in the course of,55
NA,this battle it is necessary for the protection,55
NA,of Australian industry at large that the,55
NA,Minister should be given considerable dis-,55
NA,"in fixing values, as we will no doubt",55
NA,be hear in the Committee stages.,55
NA,The fact is that there is a considerable,55
NA,"amount of safety in this matter as well,",55
NA,because the Bill provides for the need for a,55
NA,Board report before the Minister takes,55
NA,under the dumping provisions and,55
NA,"makes his declaration. On the other hand,",55
NA,"and of course, no Minister would want to exer-",55
NA,cise irresponsibly a power of this kind. The,55
NA,Minister for Customs and Excise is well,55
NA,"the aware that this is a power which, in the",55
NA,"wrong hands, or wrongfully used, could be",55
NA,bea dangerous power. You may rest assured,55
NA,the Minister will exercise it with due,55
NA,The honorable member for Wakefield has,55
NA,attention to one or two matters on,55
NA,which he has sought answers. In the first,55
NA,9d. place he raised the question of certain,55
NA,"a actions taken, or dumping declarations made",55
NA,"as a result of Tariff Board inquiries, which",55
NA,were extended rather arbitrarily by the,55
NA,He seeks first of all an assurance,55
NA,that where there is a departure from the,55
NA,recommendation of the Tariff Board some,55
NA,announcement will be made to the House.,55
NA,This kind of action happens very infre-,55
NA,quently and the case to which the honorable,55
NA,to gentleman referred-i f I may read his mind,55
NA,the -wa s one dealing with paper. For a long,55
NA,time he has been vitally interested in the,55
NA,of the paper industry. In 1962 the,55
NA,Tariff Board examined the protection needs,55
NA,of the paper and paper board industry. At,55
NA,the same time the Board was asked to,55
NA,the establish whether paper and paper board,55
NA,were being sold in Australia at dumping,55
NA,prices and whether such sales were causing,55
NA,to Australian industry. In so far as,55
NA,Customs Tariff (Dumping [8 DECEMBER,56
NA,dumping is concerned the Board found that,56
NA,there was dumping of certain types of,56
NA,papers. Some other papers were clear of this,56
NA,miserable action of dumping. In still other,56
NA,"cases it was proved there was dumping, but",56
NA,it was done in a way which caused no injury,56
NA,to Australian industry. In view of the multi-,56
NA,plicity of types and grades of paper subject,56
NA,to duty it would have . meant constant,56
NA,running backwards and forwards to the,56
NA,"Tariff Board for new references, causing",56
NA,"delay and confusion. Indeed, to avoid the",56
NA,loss of control of the import situation,56
NA,involving many grades of paper it was,56
NA,recommended that the Minister include all,56
NA,grades of paper in his declaration.,56
NA,Mr Kelly -Wh y did not he say so?,56
Mr FAIRHALL , I am sure that the,56
NA,honorable gentleman's advice will be,56
NA,tened to most carefully on this matter.,56
NA,Indeed I rather knew that the honorable,56
NA,gentleman was going to ask for this kind,56
NA,undertaking and I am happy to be able,56
NA,give it to him. I can assure the honorable,56
NA,gentleman that there are few occasions,56
NA,where the Minister finds it necessary,56
NA,advisable to take this kind of action.,56
NA,sure there is some merit in the honorable,56
NA,gentleman's suggestion that any departure,56
NA,from the finding of the Tariff Board should,56
NA,"be mentioned in the House. Unfortunately,",56
NA,"I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, the House.",56
NA,"the Minister for Customs and Excise, in",56
NA,"another place, but I shall refer the honor-",56
NA,able gentleman's suggestion and plea to him.,56
NA,I am sure the honorable member's sug-,56

NA,longer be allowed to continue. I can tell,56
NA,the honorable gentleman that a review of,56
NA,"long standing "" Gazette "" notices has been",56
NA,initiated already. It is intended that when it,56
NA,can be established that the need for anti-,56
NA,dumping action no longer exists steps will,56
NA,"be taken to revoke the "" Gazette"" notice",56
NA,specifying the commodity concerned. I have,56
NA,noted some of the other matters raised,56
NA,by the honorable gentleman. I am sure he,56
NA,is well aware that his offerings to this House,56
NA,always form the best read passages of,56
NA,"""Hansard"". I am perfectly certain his",56
NA,comments on many of these matters will be,56
NA,read by the members of the Tariff Board,56
NA,and by members of the staff of the Depart-,56

NA,"rency as I understand it, with your pardon,",56
NA,"lis Mr Speaker, was designed to simplify cal-",56

NA,cation of customs tariff. So. apart from the,56
NA,"of mathematical simplicity of the system, I am",56
NA,to sure the proposal made by the honorable,56
NA,gentleman and supported by the honorable,56
NA,member for Henty ( Mr Fox) will strike a,56

NA,"Act'."".",58
NA,These amendments are intended to coun-,58
NA,ter certain trade practices which have only,58
NA,recently come under notice. These practices,58
NA,"will, if they continue unchecked, undermine",58
NA,the tariff protection afforded Australian,58
NA,industries with consequential damage to,58
NA,those industries. One of the most important,58
NA,elements which must be taken into account,58
NA,in determining the prices at which imported,58
NA,goods can be sold on the Australian market,58
NA,in competition with locally produced goods,58
NA,is the overseas freight cost. In assessing the,58
NA,level of tariff necessary to protect efficient,58
NA,"Australian industries all elements of cost,",58
NA,"including the cost of overseas freight,",58
NA,associated with the imported product are,58
NA,taken into account. Needless to say the level,58
NA,of tariff protection is based on the normal,58
NA,or ruling costs associated with the imported,58
NA,"product. Hence, if overseas suppliers are",58
NA,able to negotiate freight rates which are,58
NA,"significantly lower than the normal rates,",58
NA,then obviously the competitive position of,58
NA,the Australian industry is placed in jeopardy.,58
NA,"Recent experience has shown that, particu-",58
NA,"larly for industrial chemicals, the freight",58
NA,rates for certain shipments have been very,58
NA,much lower than the normal rates which,58
NA,would have been taken into account in,58
NA,assessing the level of tariff protection. I has,58
NA,been found that certain chemicals have been,58
NA,carried on charter vessels at rates which are,58
NA,only one third of the ruling rates.,58
NA,There is some doubt as to whether the,58
NA,existing provisions of the Customs Tariff,58
NA,(Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1961 embodies,58
NA,powers to counter all forms of freight dumphigh.,58
NA,ing. The amendment which I have just pro-,58
NA,posed merely restores the provisions which,58
NA,were incorporated for many years in the,58
NA,Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation),58
NA,which was repealed in 1961 when the,58
NA,sent Act was introduced. The proposed,58
NA,amendments to Australia's anti-dumping law,58
NA,stem from the Government's determination,58
NA,to protect local industry against the invidious,58
NA,practice of dumping in all its varied forms.,58
NA,exThere is no need for me to reiterate here the,58
NA,of kind of damage that dumping can do to Aus-,58
NA,Australian industry and the Australian economy,58
NA,the as a whole. Honorable members will recall,58
NA,that the Committee of Economic Enquiry,58
NA,expressed concern regarding the effects of,58
NA,predumping and emphasised the necessity for,58
NA,the strengthening the existing law. That we are,58
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Yarra) [8.47] - Mr .,58
NA,"Chairman, the Opposition does not oppose",58
NA,what the Minister for Supply ( Mr Fairhall),58
NA,is proposing by the introduction of these,58
NA,amendments. But I should like to be given,58
NA,a little more objective information about,58
NA,freight dumping than the Minister has,58
NA,given us. He has provided us with a vivid,58
NA,description about what happens but has,58
NA,not said one word about why it happens.,58
NA,He has told us that sometimes exporters,58
NA,are able to negotiate freight rates at less,58
NA,than the normal charge and that in the,58
NA,case of chemicals the freight rates are some-,58
NA,times very much less than normal-one -,58
NA,third of the ruling rates on charter vessels.,58
NA,This brings to the notice of the Committee,58
NA,the contrast between normal freight rates,58
NA,and freight rates that are not normal.,58
NA,The question arises: Are the normal freight,58
NA,rates too high or are these dumping freight,58
NA,rates too low? I am not prepared to accept,58
NA,that the ruling freight rates to and from,58
NA,Australia are the ones by which we should,58
NA,be guided in this respect. I think Australia,58
NA,is exploited and has been exploited for,58
NA,years in respect of our freight rates both,58
NA,to and from this country by a shipping ring,58
NA,- a monopoly-tha t has been taking us,58
NA,for suckers for far too long. It might well,58
NA,be that when one compares the freight,58
NA,rate on some charter vessel with the other,58
NA,ruling freight charges one might think,58
NA,the rate for the charter vessel is specially,58
NA,low. I think the evidence tends to suggest,58
NA,that the ruling freight rates are specially,58
NA,The Government and its advisers ought,58
NA,old to be looking much more closely at this,58
NA,Act matter. The Minister has given a vivid,58
NA,predescription of what happens but he has,58
NA,given us no real reason for believing that,58
NA,he has decided that it is the low rate that,58
NA,is specially wrong. The natural assumption,58
NA,"is that the cheapest thing, not the most",58
NA,"expensive thing, is the most favorable",58
NA,thing. In this case the Government is,59
NA,taking the view that the high ruling freight,59
NA,rate is the best freight rate from which the,59
NA,measurement should be made. Perhaps it,59
NA,is the other way round. The Minister spoke,59
NA,about the invidious practice of dumping.,59
NA,We know that dumping sometimes can be,59
NA,invidious. But we know that high priced,59
NA,"goods can be indivious, too. The practice",59
NA,"of exploiting the market by high prices is,",59
NA,"on the whole, much more invidious than",59
NA,the practice of putting goods on a market,59
NA,at a price which is too low.,59
NA,The Minister referred to the Committee,59
NA,"of Economic Inquiry, the Vernon Com-",59
NA,mittee. One would be almost inclined to,59
NA,think after the events of the last few days,59
NA,that the Vernon report is being rehabili-,59
NA,"tated, and that perhaps it was true that the",59
NA,Prime Minister ( Sir Robert Menzies) was a,59
NA,little hasty in his original judgment. We,59
NA,"satisfied to give approval to the measure,",59
NA,but I do make a plea to the Minister and,59
NA,his advisers to be a little more informative,59
NA,when putting a case to the Parliament.,59
NA,"Platitudes can be very vivid sometimes, but",59
NA,very little real information has been given,59
NA,to us. I do not think the Minister has told,59
NA,us very much that really justifies this,59
NA,measure but we are prepared to accept it,59
NA,at face value.,59
Mr KELLY ,Wakefield) [8.51] - I am,59
NA,just going to ask the Minister to clear my,59
NA,mind on freight dumping. I understand,59
NA,from what people have told me and from,59
NA,what I heard during the debate on the Trade,59
NA,Practices Bill-an d I think it is true-tha t,59
NA,there is a fairly well controlled conference,59
NA,which fixes freight charges. I understand,59
NA,also that some people are undercutting,59
NA,these freight charges. I would like the,59
NA,Minister to tell me quite clearly i f this is,59
NA,the kind of thing the legislation is designed,59
NA,to prevent.,59
Mr JONES ,Newcastle) [8.52] -Befor,59
NA,the Minister replies to the honorable memtralia,59
NA,ber for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) I would like,59
NA,to make a very brief comment. I direct,59
NA,attention to the Government's decision to,59
NA,accept some of the recommendations of the,59
NA,Vernon Committee of Economic Inquiry. the,59
NA,The Prime Minister ( Sir Robert Menzies),59
NA,came into this Parliament some weeks ago,59
NA,and dealt very severely with the report of,59
NA,that Committee. He proceeded to toss it into,59
NA,the waste paper basket. I have not read the,59
NA,report but I have had a fairly close look,59
NA,at it.,59
NA,Mr Kelly -Readin g it is very different,59
NA,from looking at it.,59
Mr JONES ,Wha t I am trying to con-,59
NA,vey is that I have not read it word by word.,59
NA,I think it took the Cabinet about five months,59
NA,"to read it, or allegedly to read it, so I",59
NA,have still a few months left in which to,59
NA,complete my study of it. At least it is pleas-,59
NA,ing to see that some of the Committee's,59
NA,recommendations are being adopted. I think,59
NA,that during many years to come various,59
NA,other theories or recommendations of the,59
NA,Committee will be heeded by this,59
NA,Parliament.,59
NA,What I mainly wish to speak about is,59
NA,something that we on this side of the Par-,59
NA,are liament have been referring to for a con-,59
NA,"siderable time, the exploitation of this",59
NA,country's exports and imports by the over-,59
NA,"seas Conference Line. We know, and the",59
NA,facts have been brought before the Parlia-,59
NA,"ment on numerous occasions, that it is",59
NA,cheaper to transport steel from the United,59
NA,Kingdom and Europe to Japan than from,59
NA,Australia to Japan. We remember that in,59
NA,"1961-62, when we were in the grip of a",59
NA,"credit squeeze, and when I understand a",59
NA,"similar situation existed in Japan, the honor-",59
NA,able member for Darebin ( Mr Courtnay),59
NA,and 1 told the Parliament that Japan was,59
NA,transporting steel from its own mills to,59
NA,New Zealand- a distance four and half,59
NA,times greater than the distance from Austra-,59
NA,lia to New Zealand-an d that the freight,59
NA,charges were half those charged by the,59
NA,Conference Line for transporting steel from,59
NA,Australia to New Zealand.,59
NA,What the Minister has said tonight,59
NA,merely confirms what we have been saying,59
NA,for a considerable time. I hope the Govern-,59
NA,ment will take the next obvious step and,59
NA,e expand the shipbuilding industry in Aus-,59
NA,so that we can establish an overseas,59
NA,shipping line. I hope the Government will,59
NA,direct the Australian Coastal Shipping Com-,59
NA,mission to extend its activities into overseas,59
NA,trading. We may then be able to move into,59
NA,field of international shipping on a com-,59
NA,petitive basis and give protection not only,59
NA,to Australia's exporters but also to our im-,59
NA,porters. I was pleased to bear the Minister,59
NA,bring to our attention the exploitation of,59
NA,Australian imports and the consequent effect,59
NA,on Australian industry. Similar protection is,60
NA,necessary for Australia's exports.,60
NA,Let me remind the Committee of what,60
NA,happened recently in connection with our,60
NA,meat exports to the United Kingdom. The,60
NA,Conference Line was going to increase the,60
NA,"freight rate by 10 per cent, from lst Novem-",60
NA,"ber and by 17 per cent, from lst January,",60
NA,but because of assistance given to Australia,60
NA,by an Israeli shipping line the Conference,60
NA,Line abandoned its plans to impose the,60
NA,increase. What the Minister has said tonight,60
NA,bears out our contention that we must have,60
NA,at an early date our own overseas shipping,60
NA,line.,60
Mr FAIRHALL ,Paterson-Ministe r for,60
NA,Supply) [8.56] -Th e honorable member for,60
NA,Newcasde ( Mr Jones) will be very dis-,60
NA,appointed to hear me say that I have not,60
NA,in fact been bringing to light any exploita-,60
NA,tion of Australia by shipping lines. The,60
NA,amendments before us have nothing to do,60
NA,with exploitation. Both the honorable mem-,60
NA,ber for Newcastle and the honorable mem-,60
NA,ber for Yarra (Dr JF CAIRNS) have been,60
NA,putting up their own Aunt Sallys and having,60
NA,fun knocking them down. The honorable,60
NA,member for Yarra raised the question,60
NA,whether the normal freight rates are too,60
NA,"high or the dumping rates too low, but the",60
NA,Bill does not concern itself with whether,60
NA,the freight rates are too high or too low.,60
NA,The honorable member will no doubt pur-,60
NA,sue this subject at length and at another,60
NA,time.,60
NA,The machinery of tariff making calls,60
NA,upon the Tariff Board to examine all the,60
NA,factors that affects prices of exported com-,60
NA,"modities. One factor clearly is freight, and",60
NA,in reaching any viable decision as to the,60
NA,level of protection for Australian industry,60
NA,the Board must consider some normal,60
NA,freight rate. Through a variety of devices,60
NA,running all the way from backloading to,60
NA,special deals with a manufacturer who may,60
NA,also have interests in shipping lines operating,60
NA,"to and from Australia, an importer has an",60
NA,opportunity to enjoy an abnormally low,60
NA,freight rate which may have nothing to do,60
NA,with the real cost of freighting the goods,60
NA,"to Australia. Clearly, if this were allowed",60
NA,to continue it would upset entirely the whole,60
NA,machinery of tariff making. It is for this,60
NA,"reason, and this reason alone, that this",60
NA,"power is to be given to the Minister, so",60
NA,that freight rates may be levelled out and,60
NA,the work of the Tariff Board may not be,60
NA,destroyed.,60
NA,The honorable member for Wakefield will,60
NA,be delighted to know that we are not in,60
NA,fact trying to stop a reduction of freight,60
NA,rates. Indeed we would be delighted to see,60
NA,such a reduction take place.,60
NA,"Mr Kelly -Well , tell us what it is that",60
NA,you are doing.,60
Mr FAIRHALL ,I f the honorable,60
NA,member cannot understand what 1 said a,60
NA,moment ago perhaps we had better talk,60
NA,about it after school. I have described the,60
NA,situation. The Tariff Board clearly must have,60
NA,some stable figures as to costs on which to,60
NA,base its assessment of the needs of an Aus-,60
NA,tralian industry and to decide on a suitable,60
NA,level of tariff protection.,60
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Yarra) [8.59] -Th e,60
NA,Minister and the rest of us have got on,60
NA,"pretty well up to date, but I think he is",60
NA,straining our patience a little too much,60
NA,and imagining that we are a little too naive,60
NA,"in the present situation. He has described,",60
NA,"again very vividly, the possibility of a",60
NA,manufacturer who may have an interest in,60
NA,a shipping line enjoying a freight rate for,60
NA,transporting his goods to Australia which,60
NA,is so low that it enables him to sell those,60
NA,goods in Australia at such a price that he,60
NA,"is, in effect, dumping the goods. The Minis-",60
NA,ter ignores altogether the possibility that,60
NA,exactly the reverse might happen; there,60
NA,might be collusion between manufacturers,60
NA,and a shipping company to bring goods to,60
NA,Australia at an excessive freight rate.,60
NA,According to the Minister there is a possi-,60
NA,bility of this wicked collusion only when,60
NA,it results in what amounts to dumping. He,60
NA,ignores it completely in relation to the other,60
NA,kind of freight rate-th e excessive one that,60
NA,we are talking about. I believe that I appre-,60
NA,ciate what is involved. If the Department,60
NA,of Customs and Excise is to be satisfied,60
NA,about whether goods are dumped it has to,60
NA,be able to compare freight rates. It has to,60
NA,be able to look at them realistically and,60
NA,be satisfied that they are normal. But when,60
NA,it is doing this it has to take into account,60
NA,two kinds of freight rates-th e alleged,60
NA,"dumping one, which is the low one, and the",60
NA,"normal one, which is considerably higher. I",60
NA,suggest that the possibility of collusion,61
NA,tween the parties is just as great in respect,61
NA,of the normal high rate as it is in respect,61
NA,of the abnormal low rate. I would not object,61
NA,so much to collusion if now and again it,61
NA,produced rates lower than those that it does,61
NA,produce.,61
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Lucock) -Order !,61
NA,On the first occasion on which the honorlegislation.,61
NA,able member spoke I allowed him to use as,61
NA,an illustration the contra argument in rela-,61
NA,tion to dumping. I suggest to him that hav-,61
NA,ing used that argument to illustrate his,61
NA,point and show the basis on which accordwhole,61
NA,ing to him the Tariff Board should work,61
NA,is now developing and continuing to,61
NA,velop an argument that is outside the scope,61
NA,of the proposed new clauses now before,61
NA,the Committee.,61
Dr JF CAIRNS ," Mr Chairman,",61
NA,accept your ruling. It is this kind of,61
NA,that really upsets me in a matter such,61
NA,this. If the Department of Customs and,61
NA,Excise and the Minister for Customs,61
NA,Excise (Senator Anderson) look at the,61
NA,"matter in the same way, we can be sold up",61
NA,the creek at any time. I shall not say more,61
NA,except to express the hope,61
NA,for Supply will be much more realistic after,61
NA,school when he talks to the honorable mem-,61
NA,ber for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) than he has,61
NA,been so far.,61
Mr GILES ,Angas) [9.3] - Mr Chair-,61
NA,"man, I rise to mention only two points.",61
NA,The first is the point that was dealt with,61
NA,originally by the honorable member for,61
NA,Yarra (Dr JF CAIRNS) and in respect of,61
NA,"which he said, if I recall his words, that",61
NA,three rates will apply under this legislation.,61
NA,I agree with the contention that has been,61
NA,put forward. I think it is very difficult to,61
NA,know what a normal rate is and when to,61
NA,apply the provision relating to dumping,61
NA,legislation. I put forward quite seriously,61
NA,as an answer to the honorable member for,61
NA,Newcastle ( Mr Jones) an experience that,61
NA,I had as a member of the Government,61
NA,Members Food and Agriculture Committee,61
NA,on a trip to Weipa recently. We there dis-,61
NA,covered a situation quite contrary to the,61
NA,"contention of the honorable member, who",61
NA,informed us that the establishment of an,61
NA,Australian overseas shipping line would be,61
NA,be- the solution to various problems concerning,61
NA,freights. We found at Weipa that the freight,61
NA,for the shipment of bauxite to Europe was,61
NA,35s. a ton. I suppose that this could be,61
NA,regarded as a dumping figure when com-,61
NA,pared to the rate of 45s. a ton for the,61
NA,carriage of bauxite from Weipa down the,61
NA,Australian coastline to Bell Bay. This is,61
NA,the sort of problem that we face with this,61
NA,Mr Kelly -I t will not stop that.,61
Mr GILES ,Exactly . I believe that the,61
NA,"answer is that competitive rates,",61
NA,"he whether for backloading or not, should",61
NA,deapply where possible. The Tariff Board's,61
NA,problem is to know how much it can afford,61
NA,to depreciate a rate in terms of its tariff,61
NA,in order to protect a home industry from,61
NA,imports. This is indeed a problem. I am,61
NA,a little sorry as I sit down that the Minis-,61
NA,"I ter for Supply ( Mr Fairhall), who is in",61
NA,"ruling charge of the measure in this chamber,",61
NA,as is not able to explain to me more clearly,61
NA,exactly what is a competitive shipping,61
NA,and freight and what is not.,61
NA,Proposed new clauses agreed to.,61

Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Sir John,62
NA,MCLcay) - I have received a message from,62
NA,the Senate agreeing to the resolution of the,62

NA,of a joint select committee to consider,62
NA,certain matters relating to a new and per-,62

NA,REFERENDUM (CONSTITUTION,62
NA,ALTERATION) BILL (No. 2) 1965.,62
NA,Bill-b y leave-presente d by Mr.,62
NA,"Anthony, and read a first time.",62
NA,Second Reading.,62
Mr ANTHONY ,Richmond-Ministe r,62
NA,"for the Interior) [9.8] - Mr Speaker, I",62
NA,move-,62
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,62
NA,The purpose of this Bill is to clarify and,62
NA,simplify the manner of voting at future,62
NA,"referendums. Under the existing law, a",62
NA,voter at a referendum is required to,62
NA,"indicate his vote by writing thefigures"" 1 """,62
NA,"and "" 2 "" in the squares printed on the",62
NA,ballot paper. If he approves the proposed,62
NA,"law, he writes the figure "" 1 "" in the square",62
NA,"opposite the word "" Yes"" and the figure",62
NA,"*' 2 "" in the square opposite the wcrd",62
NA,""" No "". Conversely, if he does not approve",62
NA,"the proposed law, he writes the figure "" 1 """,62
NA,"opposite "" N o "" and the figure "" 2 """,62
NA,"opposite "" Yes"". The use of a cross only,",62
NA,"or the figure "" 1 "" only, in one of the moved forthwith.",62
NA,squares does not render a ballot paper,62
NA,informal provided that the other square third time.,62
NA,"is left blank. In that case, the cross is",62
NA,"deemed to be equivalent to the figure "" 1 "".",62
NA,"At a referendum, the voter has to answer",62
NA,a specific question which is set out on the,62
NA,ballot paper in the form-,62
NA,Do you approve of the proposed law for the,62
NA,alteration of the Constitution entitled . . .,62
NA,Then follows the title of the proposed,62
NA,"Of course, the straight out answer to this",62
NA,"direct question is ""Yes"" or ""No""-no t",62
NA,""" 1 "" and "" 2 "". Under the provisions of this",62
NA,Bill the voter will be required to write,62
NA,"simply either ""Yes"" or "" N o "" in answer [9.13] - I move-",62
NA,to the question. This is a more positive,62
NA,"and, I believe, a more correct form of",62
NA,voting at a referendum. As the arguments,62
NA,in favour and against the proposed law,62
NA,must be forwarded to the Chief Electoral,62
NA,"Officer by 30th December, it will be",62
NA,appreciated that any change in the method,62
NA,of voting at a referendum would have to,62
NA,be passed this session to be effective at the,62
NA,forthcoming referendum. This is so,62
NA,because the arguments may well contain,62
NA,instructions to the electors as to the manner,62
NA,of voting.,62
NA,Consideration has been given to the,62
NA,question of possible confusion to voters if,62
NA,"this Bill is passed, should some future",62
NA,Senate or House of Representatives election,62

Dr JF CAIRNS ,Yarra) [9.15] -Tbi s,63
NA,"Bill, and the associated measure, fhe Pyrites",63
NA,"Bounty Bill (No. 2), are very important.",63
NA,They will involve between them the prob-,63
NA,able expenditure in the coming year of,63
NA,about Â£\i million of national revenue. They,63
NA,continue an expenditure which has amoun-,63
NA,ted since the measures were first introduced,63
NA,"in 1954-55, in the case of the Sulphuric",63
NA,"Acid Bounty Act, and in 1960-61, in the",63
NA,"case of the Pyrites Bounty Act, to nearly",63
NA,Â£12 million. This is a considerable amount,63
NA,of money and I think the House would want,63
NA,to know something of what it is doing and,63
NA,some of the consequences.,63
NA,The purpose of the provision of this sub-,63
NA,sidy is to encourage in Australia in the pro-,63
NA,duction of sulphuric acid the use of Austra-,63
NA,lian produced raw materials. The Australian,63
NA,raw materials in this case are pyrites pro-,63
NA,duced from various mining operations in,63
NA,"South Australia, Tasmania, Western Aus-",63
NA,tralia and Queensland. The two main raw,63
NA,materials from which sulphuric acid is pro-,63
NA,"duced are sulphur, or brimstone, which is",63
NA,"imported from overseas, and pyrites, which",63
NA,"is produced in Australia. In 1963, which is",63
NA,the last year for which I have comparative,63
NA,"figures, some 64 or 65 per cent, of all sul-",63
NA,phuric acid produced in Australia was pro-,63
NA,"duced from these two raw materials, brim-",63
NA,stone and concentrated pyrites. Production,63
NA,of sulphuric acid is important. Sulphuric,63
NA,acid production in 1963 amounted to more,63
NA,"than 1,300,000 tons of which 430,000 tons",63
NA,had sulphuric content. Sulphuric acid is a,63
NA,most important industrial raw material.,63
NA,The Bills provide for the payment of a,63
NA,subsidy on the production of pyrites and,63
NA,on the production of sulphuric acid. The,63
NA,"purpose of the Bills, as has been the pur-",63
NA,pose of all the other Bills that have been,63
NA,"passed over the last 10 years, is to encourage",63
NA,Australian sulphuric acid producers to use,63
NA,Australian produced pyrites as a raw,63
NA,"material, it being correctly assumed",63
NA,that if this was not done the pro-,63
NA,ducers would turn more readily to imported,63
NA,brimstone which is a more economic raw,63
NA,material. So to encourage them to use the,63
NA,Australian product a subsidy is paid on the,63
NA,"production of the pyrites which reduces, or",63
NA,"is expected to reduce, its cost to the proces-",63
NA,sor. A subsidy is paid also on sulphuric acid.,63
NA,Although I must say that I am not com-,63
NA,"pletely sure about this, apparently the sub-",63
NA,sidy applies only to sulphuric acid that is,63
NA,produced from Australian pyrites. I should,63
NA,"like the Minister for Supply ( Mr Fairhall),",63
NA,"who is in charge of the Bill, to tell me some-",63
NA,thing about that so that we can be more,63
NA,"satisfied with it. As I say, I am not sure",63
NA,whether this is so.,63
NA,The subsidy is paid to thefiveAustralian,63
NA,"producers of pyrites at the source, and I",63
NA,shall refer tofiguresin this connection for,63
NA,the years 1964 and 1965. The total amount,63
NA,of the subsidy paid in the 12 months ended,63
NA,"30th June 1964 was Â£644,000; to 30th",63
NA,"June 1965 it was Â£583,000; and for the first",63
NA,nine months of the incomplete year it was,64
NA,"Â£456,000. The producers to whom this",64
NA,money is paid are Goldmines of Kalgoorlie,64
NA,"(Aust.) Ltd., which, in 1964, received",64
NA,"Â£48,539; Mount Lyell Mining and Railway",64
NA,"Co. Ltd., which, in 1964, received Â£177,463;",64
NA,"Mount Morgan Ltd., which, in 1964, re-",64
NA,"ceived Â£109,707; Nairne Pyrites Ltd.,",64
NA,"which, in 1964, received Â£207,973; and",64
NA,"Norseman Gold Mines No Liability,",64
NA,"which, in the same year, received Â£100,593.",64
NA,"The total paid out in 1964 was Â£644,275.",64
NA,That gives the House some indication of,64
NA,where the money paid by way of the,64
NA,pyrites bounty goes.,64
NA,"As to sulphuric acid, there were seven",64
NA,producers who received bounties in 1964.,64
NA,They were A.C.F. and Shirleys Fertilisers,64
NA,"Ltd., which received Â£50,525; Broken Hill",64
NA,"Associated Smelters Pty. Ltd., which",64
NA,"received Â£147,045; Commonwealth",64
NA,"Fertilisers and Chemicals Ltd., which",64
NA,"received Â£279,294; Cresco Fertilizers (W.A.)",64
NA,"Ltd., which received Â£78,804; C.S.B.P. and",64
NA,"Farmers Ltd., which received Â£154,989;",64
NA,"Sulphide Corporation Pty. Ltd., which",64
NA,"received Â£97,101; and Sulphuric Acid Ltd.,",64
NA,"which received Â£304,743. The total paid out",64
NA,to the producers of sulphuric acid in that,64
NA,"year was Â£1,106,501. These are substantial",64
NA,sums from the public's point of view. It,64
NA,"seems to me that, considering the scope of",64
NA,"their general operations, some of the pro-",64
NA,ducers of sulphuric acid might have been,64
NA,expected to carry the production of sulphuric,64
NA,acid to the extent of the bounties that were,64
NA,paid to them. On many occasions when,64
NA,we have been considering in this House,64
NA,industries like the chemical industry and,64
NA,thc aspect to which we have been giving,64
NA,"special attention is an ancillary one, or one",64
NA,"relating to a by-product, we have found that",64
NA,the company under consideration is making,64
NA,"extremely large profits, running into many",64
NA,millions of pounds. I think that in some,64
NA,cases the companies could afford to carry,64
NA,some of the lines of production being con-,64
NA,sidered.,64
NA,The Government's attitude to the pay-,64
NA,ment of these bounties has not been un-,64
NA,changed. We find from the report of the,64
NA,"Tariff Board dated 30th June 1965, upon",64
NA,"which this legislation is mainly based, that",64
NA,the Board went to work having regard to,64
NA,certain indications that the Government had,64
NA,given to it. The Board says-,64
NA,Having regard to the Government's conclusion,64
NA,"that in existing circumstances, it is inappropriate",64
NA,to pursue the former policy of encouraging the,64
NA,use of sulphur-bearing materials of Australian,64
NA,origin for the production of sulphuric acid. . . .,64
NA,I know that some of the producers of pyrites,64
NA,"are concerned about the present situation,",64
NA,and I think it is well for them to note that,64
NA,the Government laid down as a guide to the,64
NA,Tariff Board on this matter the consideration,64
NA,"that I have just read, namely-",64
NA,that in existing circumstances it is inappropriate to,64
NA,pursue the former policy of encouraging the use,64
NA,of sulphur bearing materials of Australian origin,64
NA,for the production of sulphuric acid.,64
NA,I do not know whether that is a notice to,64
NA,the producers of Australian sulphur bearing,64
NA,materials that they have to regard this legis-,64
NA,lation as a short term measure. The bounty,64
NA,that is proposed under this legislation is,64
NA,payable until 1965. But is this the writing,64
NA,on the wall? I think the one fault in the,64
NA,way this matter has been handled over,64
NA,recent years is that there has been some,64
NA,uncertainty by the Government about what,64
NA,it intends to do in the future. This uncer-,64
NA,tainty must have had its effect on industrial,64
NA,organisation and on the attitude of the,64
NA,companies concerned. The Tariff Board,64
NA,went on to say that it had regard to another,64
NA,matter. It was-,64
NA,The desire of the Government to ensure neverthe-,64
NA,less that the change of policy referred to in,64
NA,We should emphasise that it is a change of,64
NA,policy-,64
NA,above does not operate to avoid the obligations,64
NA,which the Government recognises it has to those,64
NA,"enterprises which have co-operated, or made plans",64
NA,"on or before lst December 1960, to co-operate, in",64
NA,giving effect to the past policy of reducing Aus-,64
NA,tralia's dependence on imported sulphur-bearing,64
NA,materials for the production of sulphuric acid.,64
NA,"Putting those two things together, there can",64
NA,be no doubt that there is a change of policy.,64
NA,The Government does not intend to pursue,64
NA,the former policy of encouraging the use of,64
NA,Australian sulphur bearing materials. Is this,64
NA,assistance being given only for the purpose,64
NA,of allowing the producers to make new,64
NA,plans? Is it to allow them to prepare to,64
NA,transfer from production of this kind that,64
NA,these payments are to be made? Perhaps,64
NA,they are being made to enable the producers,64
NA,more readily to amortise their plants. We,64
NA,know that a considerable amount of this has,64
NA,been done already. Is this what the Govern-,65
NA,ment's attitude means? And is this what the,65
NA,producers understand it to mean?,65
NA,I think an examination of the circumof,65
NA,stances shows that there is no certainty,65
NA,all that the operation of these bounties from,65
NA,the beginning some 10 or 11 years ago has,65
NA,been effective. Certainly it has by no means,65
NA,been an outstanding success. It is important,65
NA,for us to try to visualise the degree of sucthere,65
NA,cess that this policy of paying bounties,65
NA,"might have achieved, because it is a very",65
NA,costly one. I pointed out at the beginning,65
NA,of my remarks that almost Â£12 million,65
NA,been paid out in subsidies. We cannot be,65
NA,sure that this has been a successful exer-,65
NA,cise at all. This year we are involved in,65
NA,"the payment of Â£ l i million, and these there",65
NA,bounties are to continue until 1969. That,65
NA,is a lot of money to spend on a proposition,65
NA,about which we may not be at all certain.,65
NA,The reason for my uncertainty is,65
NA,found in the figures given on page 6 of,65
NA,Tariff Board report to which I have,65
NA,"ferred. In some ways, there is competition",65
NA,between pyrites and other types of sulphur,65
NA,bearing material. The table at page 6 of,65
NA,Tariff Board's report discloses that from,65
NA,1957 to 1963 there has been a quite signicrease,65
NA,ficant and constant fall in the proportion,65
NA,of the sulphur content of sulphuric acid,65
NA,"is attributable to pyrites. In 1957, 31.5",65
NA,"cent, of the sulphur content of sulphuric",65
NA,"acid came from pyrites. In 1963, the",65
NA,"portion was 25.3 per cent., which represents",65
NA,a fall of 6.2 per cent. That fall has been,65
NA,a continuing one right up to the present,65
NA,"time, and it will probably continue from",65
NA,now on at an increasing rate. On the other,65
NA,"hand, the proportion that has come from",65
NA,brimstone or imported sulphur bearing,65
NA,material has remained fairly constant.,65
NA,"was 49.2 per cent., or almost one-half,",65
NA,1957 and in 1963 it was 49.3 per cent. The,65
NA,"load carried by imported brimstone, the",65
NA,"kind of thing that we were trying to reduce,",65
NA,"has remained constant, while the load carpetroleum",65
NA,"ried by Australian produced pyrites, the the field.",65
NA,"sort of thing we were trying to increase,",65
NA,"has fallen by 6.2 per cent, over the period",65
NA,in question. Whilst brimstone has not,65
NA,creased its share-i t has still about half-,65
NA,what then has increased? The answer is,65
NA,zinc concentrates. The production of sulpyrites,65
NA,phuric acid from zinc concentrates Has,65
NA,"from 11 per cent, in 1957-th e year I years",65
NA,choose because it is fairly representative for,65
NA,"other comparisons-t o 16.8 per cent, in",65
NA,"1963, an increase of 5.8 per cent. There",65
NA,has been a slight change in relation to some,65
NA,"the other basic materials, but it is quite",65
NA,at clear that brimstone has retained a fairly,65
NA,"constant proportion, pyrites has fallen by",65
NA,"about 6 per cent, and zinc concentrates has",65
NA,"risen by about 6 per cent. Of course, zinc",65
NA,concentrates are Australian produced and,65
NA,is no subsidy on them. It might there-,65
NA,fore be better for the Australian economy,65
NA,as a whole to see this trend continue and,65
NA,a raw material which does not need a sub-,65
NA,has sidy compete with imported brimstone.,65
NA,There is no certainty that this system of,65
NA,"using a bounty has been a success, because",65
NA,is no certainty that it has produced the,65
NA,kind of result that it was assumed was,65
NA,"necessary. Why is this so? The answer is, I",65
NA,"think, first that the cost of brimstone has",65
NA,been particularly low compared to its nor-,65
NA,"to be mal cost on the world market and,",65
NA,"the secondly, in comparison with pyrites. A l",65
NA,re30th September 1964 imported brimstone,65
NA,"cost Â£12 18s. 7d. a ton, at 31st March",65
NA,"1965, Â£13 14s. 4d. and at 30th September",65
NA,"the 1965, Â£16 a ton. The advantage that brim-",65
NA,"stone has had, which has led to a vast in-",65
NA,"in the quantity imported by Australia,",65
NA,is perhaps diminishing. In 1960 imports,65
NA,"that were 221,778 tons and in 1964, 376,639",65
NA,per tons. There has been quite a dramatic in-,65
NA,crease in the quantity of brimstone im-,65
NA,proported into Australia and this has been,65
NA,pardy the function of the relatively low,65
NA,"price. However, if the price is going to",65
NA,behave as the 30th September 1965 price,65
NA,indicates-whe n it was Â£16 a ton-th e com-,65
NA,parative advantage that brimstone has will,65
NA,be diminished. There would need to be a,65
NA,reduction in the advantage for the apparent,65
NA,It purpose of the payment of this subsidy to,65
NA,in be significantly achieved. It seems to me,65
NA,there is a possibility of another competitor,65
NA,coming into the field very soon. Industry in,65
NA,Western Australia seems to suggest that,65
NA,byproducts might also come into,65
NA,Unless the brimstone prices rise the,65
NA,inbounty will not offset the trend that is,65
NA,apparent in thefiguresI have quoted from,65
NA,the Tariff Board's report. The share of,65
NA,in the total raw material used in,65
NA,risen Australia has been downwards for seven,65
NA,and that trend is certain to continue.,65
NA,Is that what the Government wants? I do,66
NA,not think that there can be any doubt that,66
NA,the answer is yes. If it were not yes I do,66
NA,not think the Government would have,66
NA,given the Tariff Board to understand what,66
NA,"the Tariff Board says it does understand,",66
NA,"namely, that there has been a change of",66
NA,policy of encouraging the use of sulphur,66
NA,bearing materials of Australian origin for,66
NA,the production of sulphuric acid. I am sure,66
NA,the evidence shows that It is the Govern-,66
NA,ment's intention that the trend in respect of,66
NA,pyrites should continue. I think this needs,66
NA,emphasising to all those people in the vari-,66
NA,"ous parts of Australia-Wester n Australia,",66
NA,"South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland",66
NA,-wh o are interested in the production of,66
NA,pyrites. Perhaps in some ways it is unfor-,66
NA,tunate that after 10 or 11 years of a policy,66
NA,of paying almost Â£12 million in subsidies,66
NA,this is the stage we have reached in 1965.,66
NA,It is not a very convincing illustration of,66
NA,the intelligent use of a subsidy for the main-,66
NA,tenance and development of Australian,66
NA,production.,66
NA,The five pyrites producers that I have,66
NA,mentioned in stating the amounts paid to,66
NA,"them in subsidies in 1964 employ, the Tariff",66
NA,"Board's report tells us, 3,800 persons, of",66
NA,whom at least 350 are directly engaged in,66
NA,mining pyrites. Is there some sleight of hand,66
NA,in this section of the Tariff Board's report?,66
NA,How many are actually engaged in the,66
NA,"mining of pyrites? Is it only 350 and, if so,",66
NA,"why has there been mention of the 3,800",66
NA,persons employed by these five companies?,66
NA,We know that these companies do not pro-,66
NA,duce only pyrites. They produce other,66
NA,"materials from their mines, but the Tariff",66
NA,"Board has tended to suggest that 3,800 per-",66
NA,sons are involved in pyrites mining when,66
NA,perhaps there are only 350. There is some,66
NA,vagueness here that I think may be,66
NA,deliberate. How many are actually con-,66
NA,cerned? Then the implication is taken a little,66
NA,"further. The report says that 35,000 people",66
NA,living in the towns concerned are directly,66
NA,dependent upon the mines. Are they directly,66
NA,dependent upon pyrites? Obviously not.,66
NA,There is no suggestion that the mines at,66
NA,"Kalgoorlie, Mount Morgan and Mount",66
NA,Lyell are dependent on pyrites. If they had,66
NA,to stop producing pyrites-an d it seems to,66
NA,be the Government's intention that sooner,66
NA,or later they should stop such production-,66
NA,would the mines close down? No. They,66
NA,"might be a little less profitable, they might",66
NA,"reduce their scale of operation, and between",66
NA,"them all they might put off 350 men, but",66
NA,"certainly not 3,800. Between them all, some",66
NA,"few of the 35,000 people who live in the",66
NA,"towns might be adversely affected. However,",66
NA,the Tariff Board's report seems to indicate,66
NA,tbat if this bounty were not paid it might,66
NA,"well be that 3,800 men would suddenly lose",66
NA,"their jobs and 35,000 people directly",66
NA,dependent upon the mines might have to,66
NA,move elsewhere. I do not think this is fair,66
NA,reckoning. I do not think the Tariff Board,66
NA,has been quite straightforward on this. I,66
NA,think at best there has been some vagueness,66
NA,that should not exist.,66
NA,I should like now to discuss sulphuric acid,66
NA,and its production. The payment of a bounty,66
NA,on sulphuric acid has been going on for,66
NA,much longer than that on pyrites. Although,66
NA,"I have laid some stress on pyrites, it is far",66
NA,less important than sulphuric acid. Up to,66
NA,"1964 an amount of Â£1,794,000 has been",66
NA,"paid on pyrites but Â£10,084,000 on sulphuric",66
NA,"acid, so sulphuric acid is the much more",66
NA,costly substance that we are subsidising. The,66
NA,seven companies that produce sulphuric acid,66
NA,are much bigger and far more significant,66
NA,than the companies producing pyrites and,66
NA,most are thoroughly interlocked. My friend,66
NA,the honorable member for Lalor ( Mr.,66
NA,Pollard) has their interlocking at his finger-,66
NA,tips and during the course of his speech a,66
NA,little later tonight he will demonstrate this.,66
NA,It seems to me that a handout of about Â£1,66
NA,million a year to these large interlocked,66
NA,enterprises is a considerable amount to ask,66
NA,the public of Australia to pay in these,66
NA,circumstances.,66
NA,"Also, I raise the question which I",66
NA,mentioned to the Minister: Is the bounty,66
NA,on sulphuric acid paid only on sulphuric,66
NA,acid that is made from pyrites or is it paid,66
NA,on sulphuric acid made from other,66
NA,"materials? If it is, it is a particularly",66
NA,unjustifiable procedure. If it is possible for,66
NA,manufacturers to get a bounty on sulphuric,66
NA,acid produced from imported brimstone it,66
NA,would be utter stupidity. If it is possible,66
NA,for them to get a bounty on sulphuric acid,66
NA,produced from zinc concentrates it would,66
NA,probably be unjustified.,66
NA,NA,66
NA,that case.,66
NA,Dr J. F. CABINS -I f the bounty is,66
NA,lower there may be something to justify it,66
NA,but certainly the comparative costs of zinc,67
NA,"concentrates, pyrites and even brimstone",67
NA,would not justify the payment of a sub-,67
NA,stantial bounty. Perhaps information on,67
NA,this matter is available somewhere. I have,67
NA,not read every word of the Tariff Board's,67
NA,"report for a week or 10 days, but as far",67
NA,as I know there is no clarity on this matter.,67
NA,I would like the Minister to clarify the,67
NA,situation.,67
NA,The question 1 posed was: If the bounty,67
NA,was not paid what difference would it make,67
NA,"to the seven companies which, in some",67
NA,"cases, are very closely interlocked whose",67
NA,sulphuric acid production is only a relatively,67
NA,small part of their total operations? As the,67
NA,bounty is substantially paid in respect of,67
NA,the use of pyrites and as most producers,67
NA,are already preparing to shift out of the,67
NA,production of sulphuric acid from pyrites,67
NA,"to other things, the non-payment of the",67
NA,bounty is not likely significantly to interfere,67
NA,with their operations. One has the feeling,67
NA,that this bounty is a kind of hand out at,67
NA,the end of the road to allow these com-,67
NA,"panies, perhaps, to write off some of the",67
NA,"capital they have invested, which they can-",67
NA,"not otherwise do. The Government is, in a",67
NA,"sense, giving them notice that there is a",67
NA,change of policy; that it will continue to,67
NA,encourage the production of sulphuric acid,67
NA,from Australian sulphur bearing materials;,67
NA,that it will pay the bounty until 1969 and,67
NA,therefore the companies may clean up what,67
NA,is left over. Is that the position? It seems,67
NA,pretty clear that it is.,67
NA,The Opposition is not opposing the,67
NA,measure but we consider that there should,67
NA,be a much closer and more detailed in-,67
NA,quiry. It may be that the Government's,67
NA,policy is wrong. It may be that the pro-,67
NA,position that I quoted from page 3 of the,67
NA,"Board's report, which is the basic proposi-",67
NA,tion in the whole business- a change of,67
NA,policy from the encouragement of the use,67
NA,of Australian produced sulphur bearing,67
NA,materials-i s wrong. It may be essential,67
NA,for purposes of national development to,67
NA,continue the policy which the Government,67
NA,is now changing. It may be desirable to,67
NA,exclude the importation altogether of brim-,67
NA,stone. This is a distinct possibility. I,67
NA,think that anything the Tariff Board has,67
NA,done so far would justify us in believing,67
NA,that this may be the case. I direct the,67
NA,attention of the Minister particularly to a,67
NA,statement in the Tariff Board's report. This,67
NA,is an astonishing statement to find at this,67
NA,stage in the business. I do not think the,67
NA,Board is to blame for this. I think that the,67
NA,Board has been put in its present position,67
NA,as a result of the situation that the Govern-,67
NA,ment has defined in respect to it. The,67
NA,Board states-,67
NA,No other or additional forms of discharging,67
NA,the Government's obligations have been considered,67
NA,by the Board in what has been essentially a,67
NA,"cursory examination of alternatives, undertaken",67
NA,merely to assist the Government should it wish,67
NA,to reconsider the question.,67
NA,It is quite astonishing to me that the Board,67
NA,at this late stage should say that. The,67
NA,Board's first inquiry was made in 1954. It,67
NA,"held another inquiry in 1958, another in",67
NA,"1960 and, I believe, another in 1962. It",67
NA,"began this cursory inquiry, as the Board",67
NA,"calls it, on 8th June 1964 and made its",67
NA,report on 30th June 1965-jus t over one,67
NA,year later although it was a cursory inquiry.,67
NA,This leads one to wonder how long the,67
NA,Tariff Board would take if it wanted to,67
NA,make a thorough and detailed inquiry. It is,67
NA,remarkable that the Government should bs,67
NA,changing its policy on the basis of a cur-,67
NA,sory inquiry that has taken a little over a,67
NA,year to carry out and in respect of which,67
NA,the Board has reported-,67
NA,No other or additional forms of discharging the,67
NA,Government's obligations . . . in what has,67
NA,been a cursory examination of alternatives . . .,67
NA,The crux of the matter is the alternatives.,67
NA,What other alternatives are available? It is,67
NA,a matter of technical priorities. What are,67
NA,the possibilities in the future? Yet the,67
NA,Board makes a cursory examination of,67
NA,"alternatives, on which the Government's",67
NA,position is defined.,67
NA,The Opposition will not oppose this legis-,67
NA,lation. The bounty will be paid until 1969.,67
NA,"Nobody will be put out of business, but we",67
NA,do not accept the situation. We believe that,67
NA,a closer and more detailed inquiry is needed.,67
NA,We believe that the crux of that inquiry,67
NA,should be a consideration of the technical,67
NA,alternatives. What is the future of pyrites,67
NA,production in Australia? Is the Government,67
NA,"serving notice that, as far as this bounty is",67
NA,"concerned, the Government will wind it up",67
NA,do not in about 1969? Does the Government know,67
NA,anything about the possibilities of this,67
NA,apparently new development. Between,67
NA,1957 and 1963 the use of zinc concentrates,67
NA,as the basic raw material in the production,67
NA,of sulphuric acid increased by almost 6,67
NA,"per cent, while the use of pyrites for the",68
NA,same purpose decreased by about 6 per,68
NA,cent. What is the future of the develop-,68
NA,ment of zinc concentrates? Clearly these are,68
NA,alternatives which the Tariff Board should,68
NA,have taken into account. What is the possi-,68
NA,bility in the future of raw materials coming,68
NA,from the petroleum industry as by-products?,68
NA,This appears to be a developing field.,68
NA,NA,68
- Dr JF CAIRNS ,Wha t are the pos-,68
NA,sibilities in the future of production from,68
NA,"gases, as the honorable member for Lalor",68
NA,mentioned? All of these things have been,68
NA,given a cursory examination on which the,68
NA,House is asked to approve an expenditure of,68
NA,Â£14 million this year and to continue an,68
NA,expenditure at something like that rate each,68
NA,year until 1969. This is not good enough for,68
NA,any government or any party in opposition,68
NA,to accept. We will not oppose the Bill,68
NA,because wc do not want to take action which,68
NA,might dislocate the already existing industry,68
NA,or upset it even worse than the Govern-,68
NA,ment's uncertainty over the last five or six,68
NA,years has upset it. We do not wish to upset,68
NA,the industry as much as the Government's,68
NA,indiiference and change of policy un-,68
NA,doubtedly will upset it. But at the same time,68
NA,as we refrain from standing in the way of,68
NA,"the payment of this bounty, we believe that",68
NA,there should be a closer and more detailed,68
NA,inquiry before any final decisions about the,68
NA,future of policy are made. I put this to the,68
NA,Minister in the hope that he will take it,68
NA,"seriously, because this is the considered",68
NA,position of the Opposition.,68
NA,The Opposition anticipated that this Bill,68
NA,might have been debated last week. We,68
NA,took special steps to avoid that so that we,68
NA,could use the time in order to make a closer,68
NA,examination of the industry. This we have,68
NA,done and our considered position is that we,68
NA,do not intend to take any action which,68
NA,would add to the uncertainty or confusion,68
NA,that must exist in the minds of the indus-,68
NA,try as a result of the Government's attitude.,68
NA,"At the same time, we believe that a much",68
NA,more detailed and close inquiry should be,68
NA,"made, particularly in respect of the alterna-",68
NA,"tives for the future, before any final policy",68
NA,is decided by the Government. We are,68
NA,"refraining from moving any amendment,",68
NA,"which we considered at length doing,",68
NA,because we believe that the position warrants,68
NA,the full force of examination. The Oppo-,68
NA,sition has refrained from taking positive,68
NA,action which may affect the industry. At the,68
NA,"same time, we require the Government to",68
NA,take our position seriously and to give it,68
NA,the consideration that I am sure the industry,68
NA,and the people of Australia believe it,68
NA,deserves.,68
Mr GILES ,Angas) [9.50] - I was,68
NA,interested in the views of the honorable,68
NA,member for Yarra (Dr JF CAIRNS). I am,68
NA,grateful that he has prompted my memory,68
NA,on a passage at page 10 of the Tariff Board's,68
NA,report. I think that many people probably,68
NA,agree with the thinking of the honorable,68
NA,member for Yarra on the future of the,68
NA,production of acid from pyrites. I would not,68
NA,"say for a moment that I agree with him,",68
NA,but perhaps my opinion is coloured by the,68
NA,"fact that Brokunga, which is the source of",68
NA,"pyrites used by Nairne Pyrites Pty. Ltd., is",68
NA,in the electorate of Angas. This is a pleasant,68
NA,and well established town. The honorable,68
NA,member of Yarra said that a pas-,68
NA,sage in the Tariff Board's report was incor-,68
NA,"rect, because it did allow for the con-",68
NA,tinued existence of these towns if pyrites,68
NA,did not remain as the source material of,68
NA,sulphuric acid. This would not be so with,68
NA,"the pyrites used by the Nairne company,",68
NA,and it would not be so with Sulphuric Acid,68
NA,"Pty. Ltd., which uses the acid. It would not",68
NA,"be so with Norseman Gold Mines, either.",68
NA,These sources do not process a raw mate-,68
NA,rial and finish with pyrites as a by-product.,68
NA,They mine for pyrites and the existence of,68
NA,the town depends on whether pyrites is,68
NA,to be the source of sulphuric acid.,68
NA,The honorable member for Yarra ques-,68
NA,tioned whether the Board's inquiry or in-,68
NA,quiries had been cursory. I think it is appo-,68
NA,"site to look at the terms of reference, which",68
NA,are included in the last report of the Board.,68
NA,The terms of reference are laid down by,68
NA,"the Minister. On page 3 of its report, for",68
NA,"instance, the Board states-",68
NA,In pursuance of the Minister's reference the,68
NA,Board has made the necessary inquiry and submits,68
NA,the following report.,68
NA,I think that possibly that is all the Board can,68
NA,be expected to do.,68
Dr JF CAIRNS , I said that.,68
Mr GILES , I am sorry; I did not hear,68
NA,the honorable member say that. I thought,68
NA,he was trying to convey the impression,69
NA,"that, in its inquiries, the Board should have",69
NA,had a look at the full problem involved in,69
NA,the production of acid from the various,69
NA,sources. We should appreciate that the in-,69
NA,quiries of the Tariff Board are limited to,69
NA,the terms of reference. The suggestion has,69
NA,been made before that a fully inquiry be,69
NA,conducted into many aspects of the indusiry.,69
NA,"Without boring the House by reading them,",69
NA,I point out that many of these aspects are,69
NA,mentioned in the report of the Tariff Board.,69
NA,"However, a full inquiry could be a worth-",69
NA,while exercise either by the Tariff Board,69
NA,or by some select committee.,69
NA,I pass on to the subsidy. The question has,69
NA,been raised whether the subsidy applies more,69
NA,generally than merely to acid that is ob-,69
NA,tained from pyrites. My understanding is,69
NA,that a sliding scale applies from the point,69
NA,of production of pyrites to the production of,69
NA,sulphuric acid from pyrites. In South Aus-,69
NA,"tralia, this is manufactured by Sulphuric",69
NA,Acid Pty. Ltd. A sliding scale subsidy also,69
NA,"applies to sinter gas, which is produced by",69
NA,Broken Hill Associated Smelters Pty. Ltd. I,69
NA,think the honorable member for Yarra men-,69
NA,"tioned this out of context. Thirdly, then a",69
NA,flat rate bounty applies to the production,69
NA,of sulphuric acid. It is primarily to this,69
NA,matter that I want to direct my attention as,69
NA,I go along.,69
NA,"Before I do so, I would like to take up",69
NA,one or two points at this stage of the debate.,69
NA,The first is the rather interesting trend of,69
NA,the increasing percentage of production of,69
NA,sulphuric acid from zinc concentrates. This,69
NA,also was mentioned by the honorable mem-,69
NA,ber for Yarra. The percentages are 10.4 per,69
NA,"cent, in 1955, and then 10.6 per cent., 11",69
NA,"per cent., 11.7 per cent., 12.2 per cent.,",69
NA,"11.8 per cent., 14.1 per cent., 16.2 per cent,",69
NA,to 16.8 per cent. My understanding- I may,69
NA,be wrong-i s that the capacity for the pro-,69
NA,duction of acid from this source is limited.,69
NA,This must be a very slow and long term,69
NA,"process, if it is to be of any assistance in",69
NA,the production of sulphuric acid and sub-,69
NA,sequently of superphosphate. I would suggest,69
NA,that the increase in the use of zinc con-,69
NA,centrates would barely keep up with the,69
NA,increasing use of superphosphate and sul-,69
NA,phuric acid as an ingredient of it. As has,69
NA,"been said, this is an interesting trend, but",69
NA,I do not think we can afford to minimise,69
NA,the importance of pyrites as a source of sul-,69
NA,"phuric acid, because of this trend.",69
NA,"The honorable member for Yarra, I think",69
NA,"rightly, made the point-a t one stage I",69
NA,wondered whether he would get there-tha t,69
NA,the price of brimstone is entirely responsible,69
NA,for the percentage figures he quoted from,69
NA,the chart that is proffered in the Tarifl,69
NA,Board's report. It is not hard to imagine a,69
NA,situation in which the swing would start,69
NA,"back the other way. In 1962, the sulphur",69
NA,content of sulphuric acid attributable to,69
NA,"brimstone represented 50.4 per cent, of the",69
NA,total supplies used in Australia. The percen-,69
NA,tage was down to 49.3 in 1963. My infor-,69
NA,mation is that the price of brimstone can be,69
NA,expected to rise a little in the years to come.,69
NA,It is a matter now of deciding who is expert,69
NA,in this field. Someone must be able to do a,69
NA,"projection of sorts, based on supplies of this",69
NA,"material and shipping rates, and rationalise",69
NA,this with the value to Australia of a home,69
NA,produced article.,69
Dr JF CAIRNS ,D o not mention the,69
NA,"word "" projection "".",69
Mr GILES , I know it is a dangerous,69
NA,word to use. Perhaps I could dig up some,69
NA,other form of projection. The point at issue,69
NA,is that this must be looked at. On the evi-,69
NA,"dence before me at this stage, I doubt",69
NA,whether it is rational or reasonable to say,69
NA,that in 1969 the overall production of acid,69
NA,from the source of pyrites should come to,69
NA,a halt. It may be as well at this stage for,69
NA,me to read from a letter I have received,69
NA,from Sulphuric Acid Pty. Ltd. in South,69
NA,Australia. It states-,69
NA,We are very concerned to learn of the proposal,69
NA,to reduce the subsidy on sulphuric acid produced,69
NA,"from pyrites from Â£3 to Â£2 10s. per ton, a figure",69
NA,which we suggest is not supported by the costs,69
NA,disclosed in this company's operations.,69
NA,I have had access to the company's figures,69
NA,and I think that this is a reasonable state-,69
NA,ment. The letter continues-,69
NA,The operation of price control in this State,69
NA,"has unfortunately left us with little margin, and",69
NA,in a 10-year period we have accumulated only a,69
NA,comparatively small sum to augment our liquid,69
NA,funds.,69
NA,This again is a matter with which I have,69
NA,"had a nodding acquaintance, having be-",69
NA,"longed, may I say, to the left wing of the",69
NA,Playford Government in the Legislative,69
NA,Council of South Australia. For some years,69
NA,we debated price control and I voted in,69
NA,favour of it each year. I hasten to add that,69
NA,I always took the view that in the area of,69
NA,manufacture this was a far more dangerous,69
NA,principle than it was in trade and com-,70
NA,"merce, such as in the selling of shoes.",70
NA,is because the following argument imanother,70
NA,mediately comes to mind: The problem has,70
NA,"always been, under this form of restrictive",70
NA,"legislation, that firms attempting to do an",70
NA,efficient job may not be able to do so due It continues-,70
NA,to lack of sufficient profits. They may not,70
NA,be able to put down enough of their bounty,70
NA,"depreciation allowance, or enough other to Japan-",70
NA,funds into reserve to keep their plant,70
NA,modern. I think that Sulphuric Acid Pty.,70
NA,Ltd. in South Australia in many ways has,70
NA,received the worst of two worlds. It has price.,70
NA,been restricted on the one hand by State,70
NA,"laws and, on the other hand, having",70
NA,"output of 97,000 tons out of an Australian",70
NA,"total of 108,692 tons of acid produced",70
NA,from pyrites-thos e figures are from memspeaks-whic,70
NA,"ory-now , because of this 10s. drop in",70
NA,"bounty, it will receive the squeeze from",70
NA,other end. The letter continues-,70
NA,To illustrate our point we attach a statement,70
NA,"showing cost, prices fixed and cash retention",70
NA,a 10-year period. It will be noted from this,70
NA,the total accumulated margin over the ten,70
NA,"amounts to only Â£90,000. A considerable sum in",70
NA,excess of this has of necessity been spent,70
NA,plant extension and renewals (out of original,70
NA,capital) to enable production to be maintained,70
NA,and extended. The plant has now reached,70
NA,"stage when major renewals are necessary,",70
NA,no liquid funds are available to meet these.,70
NA,The Company has an obligation to repay,70
NA,"Â£200,000 per annum to the Commonwealth",70
NA,Development Bank and this must be recovered,70
NA,the price of acid. The Company is also permitted,70
NA,by the Taxation Department-,70
NA,I have to admire their language-,70
NA,"to provide Â£189,000 per annum for depreciation",70
NA,which must also be recovered in the price of firm-it,70
NA,acid. The price fixed has consistently allowed,70
NA,"only the Â£200,000 to be recovered, consequently",70
NA,no plant replacement reserve has been accumulated.,70
NA,This leads automatically to the point,70
NA,made towards the end of the paragraph,70
NA,the report referred to by the honorable,70
NA,member for Yarra. I t makes one wonder,70
NA,exactly where we are going and what is,70
NA,take place.,70
NA,NA,70
Mr GILES ,Sulphuri c Acid Pty. Ltd.,70
NA,in South Australia.,70
NA,NA,70
NA,member another story about that company.,70
Mr GILES , I have not the slightest,70
NA,This doubt that the honorable member can tell,70
NA,story about it. I will presume to,70
NA,guess what the honorable member will say,70
NA,and will reply to him before he tells his,70
NA,"story. First, let me finish reading the letter.",70
NA,The whole of the amount received under the,70
NA,and from the sale of pyritic cinder residue,70
NA,"That is ferrous sulphate, from memory-",70
NA,has also been deducted each year in fixing the,70
NA,"an So, Sir, we have the picture of a firm-",70
NA,perhaps it is wise that I make this point,70
NA,before the honorable member for Lalor,70
NA,"h was asked in 1955, directly",70
NA,"or indirectly, to set up a pyrites plant to",70
NA,the manufacture sulphuric acid in the national,70
NA,interest. Primary producers in South Aus-,70
NA,"tralia, and many others, were dependent",70
NA,"over on the supply of sulphuric acid, the supply",70
NA,that of which at that stage was in some doubt.,70
NA,years The price of brimstone was soaring. I,70
NA,on think it is well to remember that this,70
NA,firm virtually has not made one pound,70
NA,of profit over all these years. Its deprecia-,70
NA,"the tion allowance runs at Â£200,000 a year,",70
NA,but the entire amount of which has been taken,70
NA,up in repayments of principal and interest,70
NA,to the Commonwealth Development Bank.,70
NA,in I do not mind if the honorable member for,70
NA,Lalor points out that this is one of an,70
NA,interlocking series of companies. I think that,70
NA,was the phrase used by the honorable,70
NA,member for Yarra. The point in,70
NA,pure justice in relation to this particular,70
NA,might apply to other firms which,70
NA,I do not know so well-i s that it was,70
NA,given Government funds to commence,70
NA,operations and it has not made any profit.,70
NA,I have mentioned also that its entire,70
NA,of depreciation allowance has been used *o,70
NA,make repayment's to the Development,70
NA,Bank. Surely it is apposite to point nut,70
NA,to that because of this no funds are in,70
NA,existence to modernise a plant that is,70
NA,becoming fully depreciated. It is only,70
NA,"common justice, as far as I can see, that",70
NA,this company should have some ability to,70
NA,replace its plant. I f the honorable member,70
NA,for Lalor is going to develop an exercise,70
NA,on interlocking companies I point out to,70
NA,him that the shareholders of this company,70
NA,were asked to set up this plant in the,70
NA,"national interest. They now find themselves,",71
NA,"at the end of a 12 year period, in the",71
NA,position where they cannot replace the,71
NA,plant or modernise it. Nor can they find an,71
NA,alternative use for the plant. I cite those,71
NA,facts in reply to any argument the honor-,71
NA,"able member may raise. However, I have",71
NA,great faith in the honorable member for,71
NA,Lalor and I know that he would not use,71
NA,such an argument because it would be,71
NA,ludicrous to try to convince either the,71
NA,general public or members on either side,71
NA,of the House that what I have said is not,71
NA,correct.,71
NA,I move on to deal with one or two,71
NA,"I have missed. First, let me say that there",71
NA,is an inherent disadvantage suffered by,71
NA,producers of sulphuric acid from pyrites.,71
NA,"For instance, in South Australia there are",71
NA,three separate companies producing the,71
NA,sulphuric acid all situated in different spots,71
NA,around Adelaide. There is always the source,71
NA,inbuilt disadvantage of the cost of extracif,71
NA,tion plants. It is a fair estimate,71
NA,that the cost of a plant to extract,71
NA,from brimstone is approximately half,71
NA,cost of a plant to extract acid from pyrites.,71
NA,I am in quite a quandary in respect of that,71
NA,line of argument in view of what appears,71
NA,at page 7 of the Tariff Board report. In,71
NA,"that report, under the heading "" Pyritic",71
NA,"acid producers "" the following appears-",71
NA,SAPL produces acid solely from pyrites supplied,71
NA,"by Nairne. At the time of public inquiry, the",71
NA,was operating at full capacity. SAPL expected,71
NA,that demand for superphosphate in South Ausconsumers,71
NA,"tralia would accelerate, but, as it was uncertain",71
NA,"about the future of the bounties, the",71
NA,had deferred long term plans for expanding,71
NA,"capacity. In the meantime, superphosphate manu-",71
NA,facturers in South Australia have temporarily,71
NA,recommissioned small brimstone acid plants which,71
NA,had been closed down after SAPL commenced,71
NA,Operations.,71
NA,There is only one conclusion to be drawn,71
NA,from this. It is that the degree of viability,71
NA,of this company is in a stage of balance.,71
NA,That was the position when the old bounty,71
NA,was being paid. With the drop of 10s. in,71
NA,the sulphuric acid bounty it is proble-,71
NA,matical what will happen to the supply,71
NA,of sulphuric acid from this source in South,71
NA,Australia.,71
NA,When I commenced speaking I commended,71
NA,the Tariff Board on the grounds of what it,71
NA,should not inquire into and what it sbould,71
NA,inquire into. It may be opportune now to,71
NA,balance that argument. In balancing it up I,71
NA,would say that neither Sulphuric Acid Pty.,71
NA,Ltd. with which I have dealt primarily to-,71
NA,night nor indeed I myself have been able to,71
NA,find in the report of the Tariff Board any,71
NA,statistics or facts which prove to my satisfac-,71
NA,tion that the disadvantage has lessened,71
NA,between the production of acid from the,71
NA,source of pyrites and from the source of,71
NA,brimstone to the extent of 10s. in the Â£1.,71
NA,"It is quite easy to plot, fromfiguresI have",71
NA,"from the company concerned, that the costs",71
NA,"of production have fallen. Frankly, they",71
NA,have fallen far less in the last two years than,71
NA,points they have prior to that time.,71
NA,We are told by implication on the other,71
NA,hand that the cost of production of sulphuric,71
NA,"acid from brimstone has fallen also, and that",71
NA,difference amounts to a 10s. disadvan-,71
NA,tage in the cost of acid produced from the,71
NA,of pyrites. I think that it is fair that,71
NA,this House is to consider sensibly this,71
NA,to say case in a report of 13 pages from,71
NA,"acid the Tariff Board, we should be given",71
NA,the facts to prove what amounts to the main,71
NA,contention of the whole of this Bill. This is,71
NA,the point at issue in the minds of people,71
NA,who produce pyrites and more particularly,71
NA,in the minds of those who produce sulphuric,71
NA,acid from pyrites. It is at this point that the,71
NA,10s. in the Â£1 decrease applies. It is a little,71
NA,difficult to follow this argument through to,71
NA,"any degree of logicality, but for all I know",71
NA,plant this might be even more important to the,71
NA,on the end of the process. So I do,71
NA,"put in a small plea that, next time we are",71
NA,company asked to consider something of this,71
NA,"nature, we be given more statistics and more",71
NA,facts to justify exactly the point at issue.,71
NA,A lot of interesting history which is quite,71
NA,"useful is to be found in this report, but as",71
NA,the honorable member for Yarra has given,71
NA,"an overall coverage of the picture, there",71
NA,seems to be no point in other honorable,71
NA,members proceeding to do the same thing.,71
NA,"So, subsequent debaters of this Bill are left",71
NA,with the facts of the matter. The facts of,71
NA,the matter as far as I can see are more,71
NA,informative from a sheet of statistics that I,71
NA,have from the company concerned. I have,71
NA,no reason to doubt their accuracy. I,71
NA,regret that the Government has taken,71
NA,this step at this time to decrease,71
NA,the bounty on sulphuric acid from the,71
NA,source of pyrites. I hope that in time,72
NA,come some reason which we cannot,72
NA,will come to light as to why we should con-,72
NA,tinue production of sulphuric acid from this,72
NA,home source. I hope that when this occurs,72
NA,an economic way of carrying out the,72
NA,duction of acid for the important primary,72
NA,industries on which this type of production,72
NA,depends so greatly will be available.,72
Mr DAVIES ,Braddon) [10.13] -Th e,72
NA,Pyrites Bounty Bill (No. 2) 1965 is supLimited,72
NA,ported by the Opposition. It is proposed,72
NA,this Bill to extend the period of the,72
NA,tion of the Pyrites Bounty Act for a further,72
NA,four years until 30th June 1969. The,72
NA,"bounty, as indicated by the honorable",72
NA,"ber for Yarra (Dr JF CAIRNS), is at the",72
NA,rate of Â£3 a ton on sulphur contained,72
NA,pyrites. This basic rate is increased or,72
NA,creased by the same amount as the landed,72
NA,duty on sulphur falls below or rises above,72
NA,the price of Â£16 a ton. It is interesting,72
NA,note that this rise and fall occurs because,72
NA,of the disabilities of pyrites producers with,72
NA,regard to the cost of imported sulphur. As,72
NA,the honorable member for Yarra and I,72
NA,"have indicated, the Opposition supports the",72
NA,Bill.,72
NA,Pyrites in this country is produced,72
NA,companies. Since the last reference to,72
NA,Tariff Board one company has gone out of I.C.I.A.N.Z.,72
NA,operation. This was the Lake George Mines,72
NA,Pty. Ltd. in New South Wales. The five,72
NA,companies producing pyrites in Australia,72
NA,are the Norseman Gold Mines No Liability,72
NA,and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Aus.),72
NA,"Limited in Western Australia, Nairne",72
NA,"Pyrites Pty. Limited in South Australia,",72
NA,Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Compoint,72
NA,pany Limited in Tasmania and Mount the,72
NA,Morgan Limited in Queensland. Norseman,72
NA,and Nairne are wholly dependent on the,72
NA,mining of pyrites which forms the whole,72
NA,of their operations. In the case of the,72
NA,"companies, the mining of pyrites is a byafter",72
NA,"product, and a valuable one at that.",72
NA,G.M.K. of course produces gold and the,72
NA,mines of Mount Morgan and Mount Lyell,72
NA,produce mainly copper. Only a portion of,72
NA,the pyrites produced by G.M.K. is railed,72
NA,to acid works at Fremantle. No sulphur,72
NA,"obtained from the remainder of its output,",72
NA,which is processed at Kalgoorlie to extract,72
NA,gold. I know that the honorable member,72
NA,for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard) will have an,72
NA,to interesting and valuable contribution to,72
NA,see now make on this subject.,72
NA,Pyrites from Norseman is used in acid,72
NA,production by Cresco Fertilisers (W.A.) Pty.,72
NA,proLtd. at Bayswater and by CSBP and,72
NA,"Farmers Ltd. at Bassendean, both in",72
NA,Western Australia. We heard from the,72
NA,honorable member for Angas ( Mr Giles) a,72
NA,"few moments ago of the output at Nairne,",72
NA,which is used by the Sulphuric Acid Pty.,72
NA,to produce acid at North Birken-,72
NA,by head in South Australia. I thought thut,72
NA,operathe honorable member for Angas vvas,72
NA,a little pessimistic in his hopes and,72
NA,ambitions for the pyrites industry in,72
NA,memthis country when he said that ihe,72
NA,manufacture of acid would be in time wholly,72
NA,in and solely produced from imported brim-,72
NA,destone. I think the people at Nairne and,72
NA,"Norseman, whose townships and min-",72
NA,ing operations depend completely on the,72
NA,"to mining of pyrites, would be indeed sorry to",72
NA,see that day come. Pyrites from Mount,72
NA,Lyell is treated at the acid plants of Im-,72
NA,perial Chemical Industries of Australia and,72
NA,New Zealand Limited at Yarraville in Vic-,72
NA,toria. I will have something to say about the,72
NA,financial connection between Mount Lyell,72
NA,and these fertiliser works-i t dates back,72
NA,by five to 1904-whic h were eventually taken,72
NA,the over by Boral and are now operated by,72
NA,Mount Morgan currently supplies two,72
NA,acid producers with pyrites. These are the,72
NA,Sulphide Corporation at Cockle Creek in,72
NA,New South Wales and ACF and Shirleys,72
NA,at Pinkenba at Brisbane in Queensland.,72
NA,"the Here again 1 am sorry to note, from the",72
NA,"of view of the national development,",72
NA,use of indigenous materials and the need,72
NA,to conserve our overseas balance of pay-,72
NA,"ments position, that Mount Morgan Limited,",72
NA,ACF and Shirley announced its intention to,72
NA,other produce with wholly imported brimstone,72
NA,June 1965. The production of pyrites,72
NA,by these three companies has been men-,72
NA,tioned by the honorable member for Yarra.,72
NA,"In 1961-62, 184,023 tons were produced",72
NA,"while the last recorded ngures, which are",72
NA,"for 1963-64, show 229,782 tons of pyrites",72
NA,is produced in that year. If honorable mem-,72
NA,bers look at the table on page 6 of the,72
NA,Tariff Board's report on Sulphuric Acid and,72
NA,Pyrites Bounty Acts they will find that the,72
NA,"sulphur content of pyrites, for instance, at",72
NA,"Mount Lyell on the west coast of Tasmania,",73
NA,stands at 49.5 per cent. That figure repre-,73
NA,sents the sulphur content of pyrites in tons,73
NA,and the table sets out a comparison between,73
NA,this figure relating to brimstone and other,73
NA,mineral deposits throughout Australia. If,73
NA,honorable members look at the figures they,73
NA,"will find that approximately 50 per cent, of",73
NA,the tons of pyrites that are mined and sup-,73
NA,plied to acid manufacturers contain sulphur.,73
NA,"This report, as the honorable member for",73
NA,"Angas indicated, contains a mine of informa-",73
NA,tion. It is a pity that some of the confi-,73
NA,dential information supplied to the Tariff,73
NA,Board is not available to members of this,73
NA,Parliament. Some of us are in a position,73
NA,to obtain this information from companies,73
NA,"in our own electorates, but it would be far",73
NA,better if some of the information was sup-,73
NA,plied in the reports of the Tariff Board,73
NA,or if it was made available to members,73
NA,generally. The Tariff Board reports that,73
NA,from the information supplied by the pyrites,73
NA,producers it appears that the total Aus-,73
NA,tralian output could be raised by 50 per,73
NA,"cent, without increasing current capacity.",73
NA,That is correct. I feel sure that we could,73
NA,produce more and that we could increase,73
NA,our current output by more than 50 per,73
NA,"cent, without additional costs, particularly",73
NA,in view of the great development that is,73
NA,taking place at the Renison Bell tin mine,73
NA,on the west coast of Tasmania. Let me,73
NA,briefly mention here that this mine has,73
NA,been taken over by Consolidated Goldfields,73
NA,of Australia in one of the takeover deals,73
NA,that I will refer to later. Whereas previously,73
NA,the mine produced a few hundred tons of,73
NA,"ore a day, after the completion of the Â£2.5",73
NA,million expansion contract which is now,73
NA,being proceeded with the mine will increase,73
NA,"thisfigureto 3,000 tons of ore a day. From",73
NA,"3,000 tons of ore will come 1,500 tons",73
NA,"of pyrites, and from 1,500 tons of pyrites,",73
NA,"working on the basis of 50 per cent, sul-",73
NA,"phur, there will be 750 tons of elemental",73
NA,sulphur. Using for production purposes a,73
NA,"figure of only 300 producing days a year,",73
NA,and with Â£15 a ton the price of elemental,73
NA,"sulphur, as it is at present, it is found that",73
NA,the Renison mine alone when in full pro-,73
NA,duction can save this country Â£3 million,73
NA,annually for imported sulphur. The Mount,73
NA,Lyell Mining Company could easily produce,73
NA,"100,000 tons of pyrites a year. Working on",73
NA,"the same proportion of 50 per cent, of",73
NA,"sulphur, this production would yield another",73
NA,"50,000 tons of elemental sulphur.",73
NA,So the Tariff Board is quite correct when,73
NA,it says there is no doubt that the total Aus-,73
NA,tralian output could be raised by 50 per,73
NA,"cent, without increasing current capacity.",73
NA,I have already told the House about the,73
NA,great mining boom that is taking place on,73
NA,"the western coast of Tasmania, particularly",73
NA,"at Renison, and of the vast increase in the",73
NA,"output of ore. As I have said, we will have",73
NA,"a production of 1,500 tons of pyrites every",73
NA,day at Renison and it is a pity to think that,73
NA,this may be washed down one of the streams,73
NA,or simply stockpiled somewhere so that it,73
NA,"will be out of the way, while we are forced",73
NA,into the position of using increasing quan-,73
NA,tities of imported brimstone.,73
NA,The Tariff Board was told about this,73
NA,possibility of increasing the use of pyrites.,73
NA,It was told that in the event of the pyrites,73
NA,mines having to cease operations it would,73
NA,not be possible to moth-ball plant and,73
NA,"equipment, owing to the rapid rate of cor-",73
NA,rosion which would ensue. Mount Lyell,73
NA,stated that it would prove expensive to,73
NA,stockpile its pyrites at the mine since the,73
NA,heavy rainfall which prevails in that region,73
NA,would wash much of it away. One can,73
NA,"imagine what would happen, in an area in",73
NA,which the rainfall is between 120 and 150,73
NA,"inches a year, to a stockpile of pyrites left",73
NA,in the open. The Tariff Board said in its,73
NA,report-,73
NA,"The five pyrites producers employ about 3,800",73
NA,"persons, of whom at least 350 are directly engaged",73
NA,in mining and processing pyrites. More than,73
NA,"33,000 people live in towns directly dependent",73
NA,upon the mines.,73
NA,The honorable member for Yarra posed,73
NA,the question how many of these,73
NA,people would be thrown out of em-,73
NA,ployment if Australia went over entirely to,73
NA,producing acid from brimstone. This is pos-,73
NA,sibly not the right way to look at the prob-,73
NA,lem. It is not so much a question of how,73
NA,many would be displaced; it is more a ques-,73
NA,tion of the amount of bounty the company,73
NA,"attracts with its by-product, and of con-",73
NA,sidering that in the overall financial returns,73
NA,from mining operations. Some of these,73
NA,mines have benefited to a great extent from,73
NA,the bounty. I think I know what would,73
NA,have happened in the past if the Mount,73
NA,Lyell company had not had the benefit of,73
NA,the bounty and when on some occasions it,73
NA,finished up its mining operations in the red.,74
NA,On those occasions it was only because of,74
NA,the bounty that the company was able to,74
NA,break even and on some occasions to show,74
NA,a small profit.,74
NA,I think the answer to the question asked,74
NA,by the honorable member for Yarra is this:,74
NA,If it were not for this little amount that,74
NA,"company gets from its by-products, it would",74
NA,not be long before some of the shareholders,74
NA,would begin to wonder whether the mining,74
NA,operations of the company as a whole were,74
NA,an economic proposition. I do not believe,74
NA,that it would be a matter of thinking along,74
NA,"the lines: "" We will close down our",74
NA,"production ""; it is more a question of look-",74
NA,ing at the whole overall financial operations,74
NA,"of the company for a year, and when that",74
NA,is done the money derived from the bounty,74
NA,on by-products like pyrites becomes increastheir,74
NA,ingly important. It is with this in view that,74
NA,1 have put forward a case for Mount Lyell.,74
NA,"I personally, and the Opposition as a whole,",74
NA,have supported these bounties for a number,74
NA,"of years, and I sincerely hope, for reasons",74
NA,"that I shall outline in a few minutes, that",74
NA,this bounty will continue for many years,74
NA,come.,74
NA,Brief mention has been made of the,74
NA,tory of the Government's attitude to the,74
NA,use of pyrites in the manufacture of acid.,74
NA,"It is correct, of course, that the companies",74
NA,concerned were encouraged to expand their,74
NA,"operations during the Second World War,",74
NA,and they engaged in a great deal of capital,74
NA,expenditure for that purpose. The Governof,74
NA,ment's departmental officers went around,74
NA,"the various miningfieldsat that time, interextract.",74
NA,viewing managers and directors and prac-,74
NA,tically begging them to do everything pos-,74
NA,sible to use pyrites for the production,74
NA,acid. One can readily imagine how shipping,74
NA,was being subjected to enemy attack at the,74
NA,"time, and we can understand why the Gosuggested",74
NA,vernment wanted to retain a process for the,74
NA,manufacture of acid from a locally proelemental,74
NA,duced material. If we are forced into a,74
NA,position in which we are entirely dependent,74
NA,upon imported brimstone it will be a sorry,74
NA,"situation indeed, particularly if we disregard,",74
NA,"in the meantime, all our supplies of pyrites",74
NA,and all our pyrites machinery.,74
NA,The Government encouraged companies,74
NA,at that time to continue their production,74
NA,pyrites because of the tremendous import-,74
NA,ance of sulphuric acid. It is the basis of the,74
NA,"manufacture of superphosphate, and we",74
NA,know of the tremendous value of that,74
NA,"material to primary industry, which is our",74
NA,major export income earner. Every indus-,74
NA,trial concern of any note uses sulphuric acid,74
NA,at some time in its operations. There would,74
NA,"a be hardly an article in this chamber, for",74
NA,"instance, that has not come into contact with",74
NA,sulphuric acid at some time during the pro-,74
NA,cess of manufacture. These mining organisa-,74
NA,tions were encouraged during the Second,74
NA,World War to expand their pyrites opera-,74
NA,tions so that we would not be entirely,74
NA,pyrites dependent on overseas supplies.,74
NA,In 1950 there was a very grave world,74
NA,"shortage of sulphur, and again the Austra-",74
NA,lian Government asked producers to expand,74
NA,"operations, using local pyrites. The",74
NA,process in which pyrites is used is a very,74
NA,costly operation compared with the one in,74
NA,which imported brimstone is used. The,74
NA,honorable member for Angas has pointed,74
NA,out one or two of the disadvantages of using,74
NA,"pyrites. There is, of course, a very heavy",74
NA,"to freight charge, because 50 per cent, of the",74
NA,product is of no value. In Tasmania the,74
NA,"material has to be taken from the mine,",74
NA,hisseparated in the concentrate process and,74
NA,then taken 26 miles by truck to Strahan. It,74
NA,is shipped from the west coast of Tasmania,74
NA,to Melbourne. Here we are taking a product,74
NA,"in bulk and 50 per cent, of it is of no value.",74
NA,In the acid plant the iron oxide has to be,74
NA,separated from the elemental sulphur. As I,74
NA,"have said, we are transporting 50 per cent,",74
NA,iron oxide that is of no value at all. It is,74
NA,to the elemental surphur that we have to,74
NA,I was very interested to hear the views,74
NA,of of Professor Hunter of the University of,74
NA,"Sydney who, before the Tariff Board,",74
NA,directed attention to this very feature. He,74
NA,that the Government should in-,74
NA,vestigate ways and means of separating the,74
NA,sulphur from the iron oxide at the,74
NA,place of production of the pyrites. If this,74
NA,separation could take place at the scene,74
NA,of mining operations we would save a tre-,74
NA,mendous amount in freight costs. This,74
NA,would be all to the good. I hope that the,74
NA,"Government, through the Bureau of Mineral",74
NA,Resources and the various other agencies,74
NA,"that it has at its command, will take action",74
NA,of on the submission made by Professor,74
NA,Hunter and conduct investigations into the,75
NA,"possibility of breaking up the iron sulphide,",75
NA,"or pyrites, as we know it, into the two",75
NA,components-iro n oxide and elemental,75
NA,sulphur-a t the site of the mine.,75
NA,In asking the producers to expand their,75
NA,"production of pyrites, we must bear in",75
NA,mind that acid producers will require larger,75
NA,plants than are required for the manufac-,75
NA,ture of sulphuric acid from brimstone. Time,75
NA,will not permit me to go into the process in,75
NA,"detail, Mr Deputy Speaker. With a larger",75
NA,plant a great deal of extra maintenance is,75
NA,"needed on the plant itself. Furthermore, gas",75
NA,obtained from iron pyrites has to be cleaned,75
NA,to a much greater extent than gas obtained,75
NA,from a brimstone burning plant. When,75
NA,"H.SO4, or sulphuric acid, is produced from",75
NA,elemental sulphur obtained from pyrites,75
NA,there is a certain amount of sludge in it,75
NA,"and this has to be cleaned out, whereas the",75
NA,acid produced from imported brimstone is,75
NA,fairly clean. All these additional costs make,75
NA,it much more expensive to manufacture,75
NA,sulphuric acid from pyrites.,75
NA,The Government recognised all this in,75
NA,1930 as it had been recognised during the,75
NA,Second World War. When there was a,75
NA,"shortage of sulphur in 1950, the Govern-",75
NA,ment saw the purpose of using the local,75
NA,"product, despite all the disadvantages. It",75
NA,appealed to producers of sulphuric acid to,75
NA,increase their use of the local pyrites and,75
NA,gave an undertaking to help them. It pro-,75
NA,mised this assistance by way of bounty and,75
NA,the sulphuric acid bounty came into opera-,75
NA,tion for the first time in 1954 under the,75
NA,terms of the Sulphuric Acid Bounty Act of,75
NA,that year. A change came over the scene,75
NA,during the 1950's because more deposits of,75
NA,brimstone were found overseas and the price,75
NA,of the imported commodity fell. This is,75
NA,"reflected in the import figures, Mr Deputy",75
NA,Speaker. The Statistical Service of the,75
NA,mentary Library has kindly prepared for me,75
NA,statistics showing the total value of imports,75
NA,of sulphur into Australia in recent years.,75
NA,These indicate a tremendous rise in imports.,75
NA,The Service has also kindly prepared figures,75
NA,showing imports of sulphur by weight from,75

NA,The figures show that a very interesting,75
NA,development has taken place. We have no,75
NA,figures for imports from Canada until 1961-,75
NA,"62, when we imported 1,502 tons of sulphur",75
NA,from that country. Imports from Canada,75
NA,"rose dramatically from 21,218 tons in 1962-",75
NA,"63, to 47,523 tons in 1963-64 and to",75
NA,"175,754 tons in 1964-65. We also import",75
NA,a considerable volume from Mexico and,75
NA,the United States. In 1964-65 we imported,75
NA,"Parliasulphur to a total value of Â£3,239,000.",75
NA,These imports represent a drain on our,75
NA,overseas reserves.,75
NA,The high price of Australian production,75
NA,based on local pyrites brought about a,75
NA,change in the Government's policy and it is,75
NA,now of the opinion that we should use im-,75
NA,"ported brimstone. The Tariff Board, in its",75
NA,"report, admits that there is an obligation",75
NA,"to local manufacturers who, during the",75
NA,Second World War and in the early 1950s,76
NA,when there was a shortage of sulphur went,76
NA,to a great deal of expense in installing,76
NA,plant and undertaking work in order to,76
NA,carry out the Government's wishes and,76
NA,ensure that we would have adequate sup-,76
NA,plies of sulphuric acid in Australia in the,76
NA,event of any international disturbance. The,76
NA,local producers changed over to imported,76
NA,brimstone. A.C.F. and Shirleys Fertilisers,76
NA,"Ltd. in Queensland, as I indicated earlier,",76
NA,will be using imported brimstone entirely,76
NA,after June of this year. Imperial Chemical,76
NA,Industries of Australia and New Zealand,76
NA,Ltd. in 1964 undertook tremendous expan-,76
NA,"sion of its plant, based on the use of im-",76
NA,ported brimstone. Today we have only five,76
NA,pyritic acid plants in Australia apart from,76
NA,the I.CLA.N.Z. factory in Victoria that I,76
NA,have mentioned. The operators of these,76
NA,plants have stated that they can change them,76
NA,to brimstone plants at a small cost of some,76
NA,"Â£20,000. As the Tariff Board declared, it",76
NA,is up to these manufacturers to say whether,76
NA,they propose to change from the use of,76
NA,pyrites to the use of brimstone.,76
NA,I believe that the policy that has been,76
NA,adopted by the Government is wrong. Recompany's,76
NA,ports from producers of elemental sulphur,76
NA,overseas have indicated in recent weeks that,76
NA,there is concern about the extent of the,76
NA,"deposits available to them, although no people",76
NA,definite information is at hand yet. Despite,76
NA,"the huge imports of sulphur from overseas,",76
NA,in recent weeks there have been suggestions,76
NA,that deposits of elemental sulphur available,76
NA,overseas may not be sufficient to maintain,76
NA,Australian imports of this magnitude. So,76
NA,consider that the Government and the Tariff,76
NA,"Board, and particularly the manufacturers",76
NA,who are changing so rapidly to the use of,76
NA,"imported brimstone, should consider",76
NA,matter again as quickly as possible.,76
NA,be a terrible thing for Australia if we found,76
NA,that our supplies of sulphur were cut off,76
NA,by some international disturbance and we,76
NA,had to revert to using pyrites. We would,76
NA,not be able to make the change at short control,76
NA,notice and the Government should never to,76
NA,allow us to get into such a situation.,76
NA,The danger to tbe sulphuric acid industry,76
NA,was taken into account by the Tariff Board,76
NA,in conjunction with evidence submitted,76
NA,the five mining companies and the acid,76
NA,manufacturers at the Board's last inquiry.,76
NA,Evidence was given concerning the various,76
NA,"problems that are foreseen, particularly if",76
NA,imported sulphur should be used entirely.,76
NA,The mining companies submitted four main,76
NA,reasons for the continued use of local,76
NA,pyrites. It was agreed that sulphur is a,76
NA,mineral of strategic importance and of great,76
NA,"value, particularly in time of emergency",76
NA,when overseas supplies may be cut off. As,76
NA,"I have stated, if this were to happen wc",76
NA,could not revert at short notice to the manu-,76
NA,"facture of sulphuric acid from pyrites, ft",76
NA,"is important, even if for no reason other",76
NA,"than defence needs, that we maintain our",76
NA,local industry. The local manufacturers,76
NA,also directed attention to the considerable,76
NA,savings in foreign exchange that could be,76
NA,effected by the use of sulphur from indige-,76
NA,"nous sources. As I have stated, we are",76
NA,importing annually sulphur worth,76
NA,"Â£3,239,000 at a time when there is no",76
NA,need for such a large volume of imports of,76
NA,this commodity.,76
NA,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am especially",76
NA,interested in the position of the Mount Lyell,76
NA,Mining and Railway Co. Ltd. at Mount,76
NA,Lyell on the west coast of Tasmania. This,76
NA,mine has been in operation for,76
NA,70 years. It operates on the lowest grade,76
NA,ore in the world. It. is an extremely efficient,76
NA,mine. This has been recognised by mining,76
NA,"experts all over the world. Some 7,000",76
NA,are directly or indirectly concerned,76
NA,or connected with the mine and interested,76
NA,economically in its well-being. Back in,76
NA,"1905, to find an outlet for pyrites, it started",76
NA,a chemical works in Victoria for the manu-,76
NA,facture of fertiliser. During the next 30,76
NA,"I years we sent about 150,000 tons to that",76
NA,works and in 1934 we changed from pyrites,76
NA,to pyritic concentrate. This was a by-pro-,76
NA,duct of the concentration plant. In the last,76
NA,the 30 years we have shipped to Melbourne,76
NA,"It would 1,400,000 tons for processing.",76
NA,This connection of Mount Lyell with,76
NA,"chemical works no longer exists, due to a",76
NA,series of take-overs. Now the people who,76
NA,the fertiliser works are in a position,76
NA,dictate the quantities they will take from,76
NA,Mount Lyell. The quantities they take de-,76
NA,pend almost entirely on whether the bounty,76
NA,is to be continued. It is for that reason that,76
NA,I strongly support the continuation of the,76
NA,by bounty. Over the past 70 years some great,76
NA,subsidiaries have been built up. There were,76
NA,the chemical works and metal industries,76
NA,"and then, a few years ago, the financial",77
NA,operations of the company were split into,77
NA,two groups. We had the mining operation of,77
NA,the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Com-,77
NA,pany and also Mount Lyell Investments.,77
NA,"This breaking up, I feel, weakened the posi-",77
NA,tion of the company and made it easier,77
NA,for take-overs. In came Patino and offered,77
NA,to take over. That company was unsuccess-,77
NA,"ful because Boral outbid it. Later, Consoli-",77
NA,dated Gold Fields (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. took,77
NA,over from Boral. Because of the separation,77
NA,into two groups and because the mining,77
NA,"operations were set out on their own, it",77
NA,became increasingly important to look for,77
NA,all sorts of means to obtain additional,77
NA,revenue to incorporate in the financial,77
NA,balance sheet of the company. So pyrites,77
NA,has often helped us over difficult times when,77
NA,the price of copper has not been as high,77
NA,as it is today. Pyrites has often helped us,77
NA,to keep open the mine and to provide,77
NA,employment.,77
NA,"As I said earlier, I will be very pleased",77
NA,if the bounty is continued for many years,77
NA,to come because the life of the open cut,77
NA,mine is expected to be another eight or,77
NA,nine years. It has been proved that under,77
NA,the open cut there is about 40 million tons,77
NA,of ore. Tf this deposit is to be operated it,77
NA,must be done economically. It will be a far,77
NA,more expensive operation than open cut,77
NA,mining and it will become more important,77
NA,that the bounty continue because this will,77
NA,add to the returns from the mining opera-,77
NA,tions and enable us to keep afloat. Why,77
NA,should we not use tbe local indigenous pro-,77
NA,duct and so assist our overseas balance of,77
NA,payments position and guard against any,77
NA,disruption to our supplies in case of war.,77
NA,"As T have already indicated, we are capable",77
NA,"of producing 100,000 tons a year and",77
NA,Renison Bell is capable of producing any-,77
NA,"thing up to 750 tons of sulphur a day, which",77
NA,would provide a saving of Â£3 million a,77
NA,year to this country.,77
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,77
NA,member's time has expired.,77
Mr COLLARD ,Kalgoorlie) [10.43] -,77
NA,The purpose of one of the Bills before the,77
NA,House is to amend the Pyrites Bounty Act,77
NA,"1960, which was amended earlier this year",77
NA,by Act No. 37 of 1965. The 1960 Act,77
NA,provided a bounty period commencing on,77
NA,lst January 1961 and expiring on the last,77
NA,day of June this year. The Government,77
NA,therefore brought down a small amending,77
NA,"Bill prior to that date. The Bill, which was",77
NA,"passed by the Parliament, extended the",77
NA,bounty period for six months from the first,77
NA,day of July until the last day of December,77
NA,this year. The Bill with which we are now,77
NA,dealing will amend the Act further by,77
NA,extending the bounty period to the last,77
NA,"day of June 1969, that is, for a period of",77
NA,three and a half years. This period is the,77
NA,term recommended by the Tariff Board. Of,77
NA,"course, the period can be extended if there",77
NA,is need to do so when it expires. If,77
NA,necessary the action could be taken well,77
NA,"before then, if the demand for the sulphur",77
NA,"bearing material is still there. To my mind,",77
NA,the three and a half years term is not,77
NA,excessive. I believe that it certainly should,77
NA,not be any less than that if it is to meet,77
NA,the requirements of the mining companies,77
NA,which are producing sulphur bearing,77
NA,material. I shall say a few more words on,77
NA,that score a little later.,77
NA,We must keep in mind that the Govern-,77
NA,ment of Australia is under some obligation,77
NA,to certain producers of sulphuric acid and,77
NA,sulphur bearing material for the part that,77
NA,they played in that production when,77
NA,supplies of brimstone were difficult to obtain,77
NA,from overseas. We cannot be sure that a,77
NA,similar position will not come about at some,77
NA,time in the not too distant future. For that,77
NA,"reason alone I feel that we should, while",77
NA,"it is possible to do so, and within reason,",77
NA,"of course, ensure that the sulphur acid",77
NA,production plants and the sulphur material,77
NA,production mines are kept in operation.,77
NA,From 1958 up to and including June 1964,77
NA,"more than 1,300,000 tons of sulphur was",77
NA,"imported by Australia, mainly from",77
NA,Mexico and the United States of America.,77
NA,Since 1958 the largest amount was imported,77
NA,"during 1963-64 when more than 304,000",77
NA,tons was brought in. In that same year we,77
NA,"produced in Australia about 109,000 tons",77
NA,of pyrites. That met only about a quarter of,77
NA,"our requirements. However, I suggest that",77
NA,the amount we are producing at this stage,77
NA,is not the all important factor. What is,77
NA,important is that we have the sulphur,77
NA,bearing material available in case our over-,77
NA,seas sources fail or become in short supply,77
NA,while there is still an urgent demand for,77
NA,sulphur in Australia.,77
NA,"In 1950, as the honorable member for",77
NA,"Braddon ( Mr Davies) has said, there was a",77
NA,world shortage of sulphur which would have,78
NA,meant a shortage of sulphuric acid in this,78
NA,"country and, in turn, a serious shortage of",78
NA,superphosphate for our primary industries.,78
NA,This position caused the Government of,78
NA,the time some serious concern. In primary,78
NA,"industry, as honorable members are aware,",78
NA,the prime purpose of the use of sulphuric,78
NA,acid is to break down phosphate .rock into,78
NA,superphosphate. Any shortage of super-,78
NA,"phosphate, because of a shortage of sul-",78
NA,"phuric acid, would mean a serious retarda-",78
NA,tion of our primary production. Because of,78
NA,the great value of our primary industries in,78
NA,relation to overseas earnings the Govern-,78
NA,ment at that time thought it wise and,78
NA,necessary to encourage the mining of,78
NA,pyrites in Australia.,78
NA,I think I am correct in saying that it,78
NA,was during the life of the Chifley Govern-,78
NA,ment that negotiations took place between,78
NA,the Government and companies which were,78
NA,producing or could produce sulphuric,78
NA,acid from the pyrites and also the,78
NA,companies which at the time were produc-,78
NA,ing pyrites. The purpose of the negotiations,78
NA,was to arrive at an arrangement whereby,78
NA,the companies could be assisted to extract,78
NA,"sulphur or produce pyrites, as the case may",78
NA,"be, and also to ensure their protection",78
NA,against overseas companies or interests,78
NA,"which could, when supplies became more",78
NA,"freely available, supply the Australian",78
NA,requirements more cheaply than could be,78
NA,done with the materials produced and pro-,78
NA,cessed in Australia. The principle behind,78
NA,the idea was that the people who were,78
NA,prepared to install plants to extract,78
NA,sulphur from pyrites or to develop mines,78
NA,to produce the material when the supply,78
NA,was short and the demand was urgent,78
NA,should not be cast aside and forgotten if,78
NA,there should subsequently be a plentiful,78
NA,supply from elsewhere of the sulphur,78
NA,bearing material and the acid. There was,78
NA,"a fair enough proposition, and the present",78
NA,Government continued that policy after it,78
NA,came into office. The bounty is still paid to,78
NA,acid producers as an encouragement to use,78
NA,Australian produced pyrites. The Bill to,78
NA,which I wish to refer relates mainly to assistgamble,78
NA,ance given to the industry which is pro-,78
NA,"ducing pyrites, or sulphur-bearing material.",78
NA,It must be borne in mind that the mines,78
NA,from which pyrites is obtained cannot be,78
NA,turned on and off like a tap. Ji they are,78
NA,"forced to close, most of them will remain",78
NA,F.14706/65 -R -[136 J,78
NA,"closed. In most cases, it would cost more",78
NA,to re-open them when the demand for their,78
NA,product is once again with us than it would,78
NA,cost to continue paying the bounty for,78
NA,several years.,78
NA,The total amount paid out in bounties,78
NA,during the year ended June 1964 was,78
NA,"Â£644,275. This was divided amongst five",78
NA,producing companies. Gold Mines of Kal-,78
NA,"goorlie (Aust.) Ltd -which , incidentally,",78
NA,produces gold mainly and pyrites only as a,78
NA,"sideline-receive d a bounty of Â£48,539. The",78
NA,"Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd.,",78
NA,"which produces copper mainly, received",78
NA,"Â£177,463. Nairne Pyrites Pty. Ltd., which",78
NA,"produces pyrites exclusively, received",78
NA,"Â£207,973. Mount Morgan Ltd., which is",78
NA,"also mainly a copper producer, received",78
NA,"Â£109,707, and Norseman Gold Mines No",78
NA,"Liability, which is exclusively a pyrites pro-",78
NA,"ducer, received Â£100,593. Even with the",78
NA,"sulphuric acid bounty added, the total",78
NA,amount estimated to be payable in the,78
NA,"year 1965-66 is only Â£1,566,000, which is a",78
NA,very small sum compared with the total,78
NA,"of Â£56,108,000 which is paid out in bounties",78
NA,and subsidies generally in Australia.,78
NA,"As I said earlier, the recommendation of",78
NA,the Tariff Board that the payment of the,78
NA,bounty be extended for a further three and a,78
NA,half years could not be considered exces-,78
NA,sive or beyond what is necessary when the,78
NA,circumstances relating to the mining of,78
NA,"pyrites are appreciated. In fact, a mining",78
NA,company which is able to continue only,78
NA,because of the bounty it receives is restricted,78
NA,to quite some extent if it can be sure of only,78
NA,a further three and a half or four years of,78
NA,"bounty period. However, generally speaking,",78
NA,a definite term of at least three and a half,78
NA,"years will allow a mining company, under",78
NA,"normal circumstances of mining, to carry",78
NA,out development work to open up further,78
NA,ore bodies of pyrites. This would not be,78
NA,"possible, or at least would be a terrific",78
NA,"gamble, if the term of the bounty was for",78
NA,some snorter period. It would certainly be a,78
NA,if there was no certainty of continua-,78
NA,tion of bounty beyond the three and a half,78
NA,years. I am sure that some mining com-,78
NA,panies would not be prepared to take the,78
NA,gamble and would be more inclined to mine,78
NA,"whatever ore was readily available, or",78
NA,simply to carry out only that amount of,78
NA,development work which would be sufficient,78
NA,to keep the mine going until the expiry date,79
NA,for payment of bounties.,79
NA,"I suggest that it must be remembered that,",79
NA,"in order to ensure the life of a mine,",79
NA,development work must be kept well ahead,79
NA,"of the stoping or ore breaking work, and it",79
NA,"is such development work as winzing, rising,",79
NA,cross-cutting and driving which is the most,79
NA,costly part of mining operations. A lot of,79
NA,"work has to be done from which no revenue,",79
NA,"or very little, is derived. Development work",79
NA,"is usually carried out in mullock, and not",79
NA,"in the sulphur bearing material. Therefore,",79
NA,"in the case of a pyrites mine, not one penny",79
NA,is recovered from the development work to,79
NA,offset its cost.,79
NA,To open up a new ore body and to get it,79
NA,ready for stoping and the production of,79
NA,sulphur bearing material may take six,79
NA,"months or even longer, and this is all dead",79
NA,work for which no remuneration is received.,79
NA,"It is quite obvious, therefore, that if a com-",79
NA,pany is working on only a small profit it,79
NA,cannot take the odds as to whether the,79
NA,"bounty will continue, particularly if the",79
NA,bounty presently being paid is. to continue,79
NA,for only a short period. Companies must be,79
NA,positive that when the development work is,79
NA,"completed, and they reach the stage where",79
NA,they can start producing sulphur bearing,79
NA,"material, the bounty will continue to apply",79
NA,while they are actually bringing out the ore.,79
NA,"Further, we should not be concerned",79
NA,with the mining companies. Very serious,79
NA,consideration must also be given to the,79
NA,welfare of the people who are dependent,79
NA,both directly and indirectly upon the mines.,79
NA,"The closure of a mine, even a small one,",79
NA,can have a very serious effect on a whole,79
NA,town. Take as an example a mine employing,79
NA,"about 100 men. If it ceases to function,",79
NA,"those men are out of work, and all the",79
NA,"members of their families, who might",79
NA,"ber perhaps 150 or 200, are also seriously",79
NA,affected. One such mine would be Norseman,79
NA,"Gold Mines No Liability, which produces",79
NA,"pyrites exclusively. Therefore, I am",79
NA,to see that on this occasion the bounty,79
NA,period is to be at least the same as applied,79
NA,from 1960.,79
NA,There seems no reason why there should,79
NA,not be a similar extension in 1969. As,79
NA,"things are at present, if there is any sugges-",79
NA,"tion that the bounty will cease, it is possible",79
NA,that mining companies will concentrate only,79
NA,on rich or readily available ore. This in turn,79
NA,could result in the employees looking else-,79
NA,where for security of employment and even-,79
NA,tually the mines could face the further,79
NA,difficulty of lack of labour. But as this Bill,79
NA,provides for the payment of the bounty for,79
NA,a further 3 i years that position should not,79
NA,arise.,79
NA,It might be appropriate at this stage to,79
NA,draw attention to the sulphur content of the,79
NA,"pyrites being mined in Australia. If, in the",79
NA,"not too distant future, we return to a position",79
NA,where there is a shortage of supplies of,79
NA,"brimstone from overseas, it will be these",79
NA,mines which will be called upon to increase,79
NA,their production substantially so that suf-,79
NA,ficient supplies of sulphur will be available,79
NA,for our primary industries. For . the year,79
NA,"ended 30th June 1964, Norseman Gold",79
NA,"Mines No Liability showed a 48.2 per cent,",79
NA,extraction. Mount Morgan Ltd. achieved an,79
NA,"extraction of 50.8 per cent., the highest of",79
NA,the five companies producing pyrites. Nairne,79
NA,Pyrites Ltd. had an extraction of 40.7 per,79
NA,cent. Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co.,79
NA,"Ltd. achieved an extraction of 46.8 per cent,",79
NA,and Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie (Aust.) Ltd.,79
NA,had an extraction rate of 31.6 per cent. As,79
NA,"I stated earlier, the production of sulphur",79
NA,concentrates is only a sideline with Gold,79
NA,Mines of Kalgoorlie. It obtains the sulphur,79
NA,concentrates from its gold extraction pro-,79
NA,"cess. It produced only 7,938 tons of sulphur.",79
NA,The average extraction from the total pro-,79
NA,"only duction of 247,828 tons of pyrites by the",79
NA,five companies was 43.9 per cent.,79
NA,Anyone who has had any experience of,79
NA,mining pyrites will agree that those are very,79
NA,good extraction figures and that they indi-,79
NA,cate how very valuable these producers will,79
NA,"be if, at some later stage, there should be",79
NA,all a shortage of supplies from overseas. Some,79
NA,might suggest that the mines to which I,79
NA,numhave referred should cease operations at,79
NA,times when there are plentiful supplies of,79
NA,sulphur-bearing material available so that,79
NA,much more of the local product will be,79
NA,pleased available in times of shortage.,79
NA,NA,79
NA,ful suggestion.,79
Mr COLLARD ,Someon e may suggest,79
NA,"it, so I am supplying the answer before-",79
NA,hand. While such a suggestion may sound,79
NA,"all right, unfortunately one cannot turn the",79
NA,mines on and off at will. If they were to,79
NA,cease production they would soon become,79
NA,unsafe and unworkable. Consequently when,80
NA,local supplies were desperately needed it,80
NA,would not be possible to bring the mines,80
NA,back to their stage of production at the time,80
NA,they ceased operations and therefore the,80
NA,additional material would be lost. For that,80
NA,reason it is wise to keep them operating,80
NA,while it is possible to do so. It would be,80
NA,most unwise to adopt a different attitude.,80
NA,We must also have regard to the treatment!,80
NA,plants which would not last any time at,80
NA,all once they ceased operating. The cor-,80
NA,rosive effect would soon ruin these plants.,80
NA,Because we could at some time be faced,80
NA,with a shortage from overseas the users of,80
NA,sulphuric acid should be obliged to use a,80
NA,percentage of the local product to ensure,80
NA,that the producers of pyrites can continue,80
NA,to operate. There is some obligation on the,80
NA,"superphosphate companies, just as there is",80
NA,"on the Government, to keep pyrites pro-",80
NA,ducers in business. It has been suggested,80
NA,that at some future time neither brimstone,80
NA,nor pyrites will be required and that sul-,80
NA,phuric acid may be displaced by something,80
NA,equally as good and more readily available.,80
NA,If and when that happens we will be in a,80
NA,completely different position. We will not,80
NA,have worries about a possible shortage of,80
NA,brimstone or other sulphur bearing,80
NA,"materials, but until it does happen, and",80
NA,until we can be quite certain that sulphur,80
NA,"or sulphur bearing material is not required,",80
NA,we must ensure that the existing avenues,80
NA,"for obtaining sulphur are kept open, and",80
NA,those producing pyrites should be assisted,80
NA,by the payment of the bounty.,80
NA,It may be thought that the average receipt,80
NA,"of something less than Â£129,000 annually",80
NA,by the pyrites producing companies does,80
NA,not play a big part in keeping the mines in,80
NA,"production, but it would be wrong to arrive",80
NA,"at such a conclusion, because that bounty",80
NA,is of considerable benefit. During 1963-64,80
NA,the five companies concerned received,80
NA,"Â£644,275 paid on 247,828 tons of pyrites",80
NA,"from which 108,932 tons of sulphur was",80
NA,extracted. This means that they received,80
NA,about Â£2 12s. a ton of pyrites produced-,80
NA,"not on every ton of ore produced, but on",80
NA,every ton of pyrites after the milling pro-,80
NA,cess. This has been of considerable assist-,80
NA,ance. It could easily mean the difference,80
NA,between a mine continuing to operate and,80
NA,its closing down. Both Norseman and,80
NA,Nairne are dependent entirely on the proadopted,80
NA,"duction of pyrites and, as the Tariff Board",80
NA,"report points out, there is litde if any",80
NA,alternative employment in those places if,80
NA,the mines should cease production. This is,80
NA,an important factor. The removal of the,80
NA,bounty would result in an increase in costs,80
NA,to those companies mining gold or copper,80
NA,"with pyrites as a sideline. This, in turn,",80
NA,"would affect employment, particularly of",80
NA,those engaged on the pyrites production side,80
NA,"of the operations. About 4,000 men are",80
NA,directly involved and many more are in-,80
NA,directly concerned. This factor must surely,80
NA,be considered. Just because a mine is pro-,80
NA,ducing pyrites as a side issue it should not be,80
NA,overlooked that sulphur concentrates can,80
NA,bring in some revenue whereby the overall,80
NA,production costs of the mine are reduced.,80
NA,Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie receives consider-,80
NA,able' assistance under the Gold-Mining,80
NA,Industry Assistance Act. Its production costs,80
NA,are above Â£13 10s. an ounce of gold re-,80
NA,covered and gold is bringing only Â£15,80
NA,12s. 6d. an ounce. By selling sulphur con-,80
NA,centrates the company can recover about,80
NA,"Â£50,000 per annum and this may be suffi-",80
NA,cient to enable the mine to keep operating,80
NA,and show some reasonable profit.,80
NA,We hear a lot about decentralisation and,80
NA,about setting up industries outside metro-,80
NA,politan areas. Mining is a ready-made indus-,80
NA,try for decentralisation. In almost every,80
NA,instance mines are located in outback areas,80
NA,and they attract employees. If mines are,80
NA,closed down and there are no other local,80
NA,employment avenues the mining towns,80
NA,become ghost towns. On the score of decen-,80
NA,tralisation alone-th e need to extend our,80
NA,population beyond the boundaries of cities-,80
NA,"the expenditure of Â£500,000 a year, much",80
NA,of which is returned to the Treasury in,80
NA,"taxes, is not much to pay to help achieve",80
NA,an objective about which so many talk but,80
NA,upon which so few take any action. If there,80
NA,were no use for pyrites or sulphur the,80
NA,position would be entirely different but at,80
NA,"present, and for some time to come, I am",80
NA,sure there will be a heavy demand for these,80
NA,"materials, and where we can recover the",80
NA,local product at a reasonable price we,80
NA,should continue to do so.,80
NA,I notice in the Tariff Board's report a,80
NA,recommendation that the bounties be,80
NA,reviewed at least 12 months prior to their,80
NA,expiration. I hope this recommendation is,80
NA,so that mining companies and their,80
NA,employees will have ample warning should,81
NA,it ever be found no longer necessary to con-,81
NA,tinue the production of pyrites or the use of,81
NA,sulphuric acid. I support the Bill.,81

Mr HAYDEN ,Oxley) [11.9] -Tonigh t,81
NA,I am moved to speak about the attitude,81
NA,towards forestry projects in this country.,81
NA,"Specifically, of course, I apply my attention",81
NA,to the attitude to forestry projects in my,81
NA,home State of Queensland. Forestry,81
NA,mendously important subject for this Com-,81
NA,monwealth. For a long time forest planta-,81
NA,tions operated by State Governments have,81
NA,been regarded as an avenue into which,81
NA,money has been put in times of economic,81
NA,fall off when there has been a need,81
NA,resuscitate the economy. This is one,81
NA,the fields in which the Commonwealtb,81
NA,Government invests public money in,81
NA,endeavour to pick up the growth of the,81
NA,economy. There was really no serious,81
NA,national application to the development,81
NA,a planned afforestation or reafforestation,81
NA,policy to serve the future needs of Australia.,81
NA,It would seem that for many years there,81
NA,was no appreciation of how serious Auswas,81
NA,tralia's plight would be in the future,81
NA,lack of provision of afforestation projects,81
NA,"throughout the Commonwealth, particu-",81
NA,larly in the provision of softwoods.,81
NA,represents a serious shortcoming on the part,81
NA,of the State and Commonwealth Govern-,81
NA,ments.,81
NA,In forestry we must realise the need,81
NA,project our thoughts a long way ahead.,81
NA,About 20 years must elapse from the time,81
NA,the plant is placed in the ground until,81
NA,has matured sufficiently for felling,81
NA,cessing. In talking of Australia's forestry,81
NA,needs we must not think in the short term,81
NA,of what we will need next year. We must,81
NA,take action to equip ourselves for the,81
NA,changes that will confront us in 20 years,81
NA,time. It appears that there has been some,81
NA,realisation in the Commonwealth of how,81
NA,seriously we are placed in relation to soft,81
NA,woods and of the demand that will exist,81
NA,the next 20 years. The point I make,81
NA,suddenly we have transposed ourselves from,81
NA,regarding forestry as an avenue of expendi-,81
NA,ture to absorb slackness in a depressed state,81
NA,in the economy to realising that this is a,81
NA,field that is extremely important to Australia,81
NA,and one in which we must invest money for,81
NA,Australia's future.,81
NA,In this country we can successfully grow,81
NA,softwoods to meet our future requirements,81
NA,-t o meet the increased demand that is now,81
NA,being met by imports. Anticipating how,81
NA,these imports will increase as demand in-,81
NA,"creases, we can see the urgency of prevent-",81
NA,ing this heavy demand from becoming a,81
NA,drain on our overseas balances.,81
Mr NIXON ,Wha t did a Labour govern-,81
NA,is a trement do about this?,81
Mr HAYDEN ,Tha t is a sensible,81
NA,question-somethin g that we do not often,81
NA,get from the honorable member for Gipps-,81
NA,land-s o I think I am justified in spending,81
NA,to some time on answering it. When Labour,81
NA,of was in power in Queensland a lot of,81
NA,money was spent on forestry. The Queens-,81
NA,an land Labour Government was concerned,81
NA,about the welfare of unskilled labourers,81
NA,engaged in the industry. The Labour Go-,81
NA,of vernment in Queensland had the most,81
NA,successful record of any State Govern-,81
NA,ment in the field of decentralisation.,81
NA,Forestry was one avenue in which money,81
NA,invested fo achieve this success. The,81
NA,through honorable member would obtain some,81
NA,benefit if he were to read the Queensland,81
NA,"""Year Book"" and some of the economic",81
NA,This reports on this subject.,81
NA,There are a number of forestry planta-,81
NA,tions in the electorate of Oxley. Quite a,81
NA,to number of people-government ' employees,81
NA,and unskilled labourers-ar e engaged in,81
NA,this work. Several towns in the electorate-,81
NA,it some quite large-ar e dependent on the,81
NA,and probuoyancy of employment in forestry,81
NA,works for the circulation of money and,81
NA,the standard of prosperity of the people in,81
NA,the town. So when there is a cut back in,81
NA,"forestry employment, the people in the",81
NA,town feel it and the standard of welfare,81
NA,of the town is placed in jeopardy. Recently,81
NA,there have been retrenchments of forestry,81
NA,"employees in the Brisbane Valley, which is",81
NA,in in my electorate. Some of those employees,81
NA,is that had many years of service. Some bad,81
NA,served for a decade in the Forestry Depart-,82
NA,"ment. Arbitrarily, their services were dis-",82
NA,pensed with. Many of them had purchased,82
NA,homes in country towns. They found that,82
NA,they could not readily realise on their,82
NA,investment. This is often the case in,82
NA,"country towns, where there is a limit to",82
NA,"realisations of this kind. Additionally,",82
NA,these people had invested their futures and,82
NA,those of their young families in the country,82
NA,towns. I immediately contacted the Queens-,82
NA,land Minister for Local Government and,82
NA,"Conservation, Mr Richter, who advised me",82
NA,that he was greatly distressed by the dis-,82
NA,missal of the forestry workers. He agreed,82
NA,that there had been large numbers of,82
NA,dismissals in the Forestry Department. He,82
NA,said-,82
NA,The necessity to terminate the services of,82
NA,Forestry workers' at all centres in Queensland,82
NA,has been brought about by the insufficiency of,82
NA,the Loan Funds available to the Department for,82
NA,the financial year 1965-66.,82
NA,It has been necessary to reduce the work,82
NA,force of the Department by over 200 men,82
NA,and unless additional funds become available,82
NA,the prospects of re-employing all or some of,82
NA,them is remote. Unfortunately the dismissals have,82
NA,in many cases brought the staffing below a level,82
NA,which was regarded as permanent staffing.,82
NA,.The Minister expressed his sorrow at the,82
NA,dismissals and said that unless there were,82
NA,"some, change in the financial position of the",82
NA,State there was not much he could do in the,82
NA,matter. Perhaps the honorable member for,82
NA,"Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), whose party claims",82
NA,"to have an interest in rurai areas, could",82
NA,make representations in support of those,82
NA,that I now make for special funds to be,82
NA,made available by the Commonwealth to,82
NA,Queensland in order to permit forestry,82
NA,works to be carried out unhindered.,82
NA,Tonight I received a reply to a question,82
NA,that I asked upon notice of the Minister,82
NA,for National Development ( Mr Fairbairn).,82
NA,The Minister's answer was a masterly effort,82
NA,at evasion. He used between 150 and 200,82
NA,words to say exactly nothing. I am no wiser,82
NA,now as to the Government's intentions in,82
NA,this matter than I was before I asked my,82
NA,question.,82
NA,Let me refer to some of the background,82
NA,of forestry. The current rate of expenditure,82
NA,pn softwood plantings indicates that over,82
NA,the next five years we will be spending the,82
NA,"annually about Â£16 million, but we should",82
NA,be spending Â£26 million or 624per cent.,82
NA,more annually if we are to surmount the,82
NA,problem of the increasing demand for soft-,82
NA,woods- a demand which is leaping ahead of,82
NA,our capacity to supply. The Australian,82
NA,"Forestry Council, which comprises State",82
NA,"Ministers concerned with forestry, has said",82
NA,"that we should be planting 75,000 acres of",82
NA,softwoods a year if we are to have self-,82
NA,sufficiency by the year 2000. Newspaper,82
NA,articles have been written underscoring the,82
NA,urgency of the need to act immediately. We,82
NA,cannot put off this matter much longer. This,82
NA,is an important matter for Australia and Aus-,82
NA,tralian industry. Our present planting rate is,82
NA,"only 37,000 acres a year. We must double",82
NA,our planting rate if we are to achieve self-,82
NA,sufficiency by the turn of the century. Ac-,82
NA,"cording to one authoritative report, we have",82
NA,only to spend Â£3 million on softwoods in,82
NA,order to save an import bill of Â£200 million,82
NA,by the year 2000. This seems to me to be,82
NA,cheap insurance. Surely the Government,82
NA,should act. Apart from the fact that people,82
NA,"will suffer because of retrenchments, apart",82
NA,from the fact that towns will suffer and,82
NA,their standard of prosperity decline ancl,82
NA,apart from the fact that decentralisation will,82
NA,"suffer, there is an extremely important long",82
NA,term consideration. We talk about import,82
NA,replacement. Here is an opportunity for,82
NA,urgent action. We must act now to meet the,82
NA,serious problem that will present itself in the,82
NA,next 20 years and most emphatically by,82
NA,the turn of the century. There is a need for,82
NA,the Government to aot urgently and in a,82
NA,positive manner to overcome this problem.,82
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honorable,82
NA,member's time has expired.,82
Dr JF CAIRNS ,"Yarra) [11.19],- I",82
NA,wish to say a few words on what has been,82
NA,"called the "" battle of the pamphlets "". Last",82
NA,week the honorable member for La Trobe,82
NA,( Mr Jess) asked the Prime Minister ( Sir,82
NA,Robert Menzies) a question in which he,82
NA,suggested that I had written a pamphlet,82
NA,about Vietnam and that the pamphlet had,82
NA,been distributed in schools. Assuming this,82
NA,to be correct the honorable member asked,82
NA,the Prime Minister whether he would see,82
NA,to it that some action was taken to have,82
NA,a proper statement made on the matter for,82
NA,benefit of school children. The first point,82
NA,I make is that the proposition in the question,82
NA,asked by the honorable member for La,82
NA,Trobe was completely incorrect. I did write,83
NA,a pamphlet about the war in Vietnam and,83
NA,"30,500 copies of it were printed.",83
Mr NIXON ,B y whom?,83
Dr JF CAIRNS ,I t was printed for,83
NA,the Australian Labour Party by the In-,83
NA,dustrial Printing and Publicity Co. in Mel-,83
NA,bourne. The pamphlet was priced at 6d.,83
NA,It was advertised through the ordinary,83
NA,branches of the Australian Labour Party.,83
NA,The newspapers in the capital cities reported,83
NA,"on it and we notified people that, if they",83
NA,"would like copies of the pamphlet, they",83
NA,could get them at a cost of 6d. We had,83
NA,very many requests and copies of the pam-,83
NA,phlet were supplied at a cost of 6d. It was,83
NA,not a give away job like that of the Govern-,83
NA,ment.,83
NA,Mr Bryant -I t was not done at public,83
NA,"expense, either.",83
Dr JF CAIRNS ,A s the honorable,83
NA,"member says, it was not done at public ex-",83
NA,pense. It was done at private expense. It was,83
NA,published with the authority of the Aus-,83
NA,"tralian Labour Party, printed by Industrial",83
NA,"Printing and Publicity Co., sold for 6d. and",83
NA,"30,500 copies have been distributed, most of",83
NA,them being sold. The cost of more than Â£600,83
NA,has been more than recouped in the sale of,83
NA,the pamphlet. The pamphlet I wrote was,83
NA,"sold. It was bought by people, a number",83
NA,of whom thought it was worth more than,83
NA,6d.,83
NA,Mr Turnbull -Tha t was before they,83
NA,read it.,83
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Th e honorable mem-,83
NA,ber for Mallee is a great humorist at this,83
NA,hour of the night. We hardly hear anything,83
NA,of him during the day.,83
NA,Mr Turnbull -Wa s it before they read it,83
NA,or not?,83
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Ha s the honorable,83
NA,member read it?,83
NA,Mr Turnbull -No .,83
Dr JF CAIRNS ,H e should get a,83
NA,copy and form his own judgment of it.,83
NA,In contrast to the way my pamphlet was,83
NA,"produced, the Government, with all the",83
NA,resources of the Commonwealth at its distribution.,83
NA,"posal, has chosen to publish at public",83
NA,expense a document that contains nothing,83
NA,but extracts from a few speeches,83
NA,Ministers. It is a party document. It con-,83
NA,sists of speeches made by a number of,83
NA,"politicians, a number of members of the",83
NA,Parliament. It has been distributed at,83
NA,government expense to teachers and to,83
NA,other people in the community. It has been,83
NA,distributed at the expense of the people of,83
NA,Australia. The suggestion was made that this,83
NA,was done because my pamphlet had been,83
NA,distributed in the schools. 1 should think,83
NA,that some teachers have asked for copies of,83
NA,"my pamphlet. If they have, they have",83
NA,received them. But we have taken no action,83
NA,whatever at any stage to distribute the,83
NA,pamphlet that I wrote to teachers or to,83
NA,children in schools. It was not part of our,83
NA,intention to do so. But an attempt was made,83
NA,to justify the circulation through the schools,83
NA,of this drummed up job of extracts from,83
NA,"politicians' speeches, produced at the",83
NA,"expense of the public, by making the com-",83
NA,pletely unfounded claim that my pamphlet,83
NA,was circulated through schools. If this is,83
NA,the basis on which the Government and the,83
NA,honorable member for La Trobe seek to,83
NA,justify the circulation of this political docu-,83
NA,"ment through the schools at public expense,",83
NA,their justification disappears completely.,83
NA,"Let me mention two other matters. First,",83
NA,I thank the honorable member for La Trobe,83
NA,and the Prime Minister for the wonderful,83
NA,advertisement they have given to the,83
NA,"pamphlet that I have written, because we",83
NA,have had hundreds of requests for it. Most,83
NA,of the requests have come from teachers,83
NA,"who, in letters that they have written to me,",83
NA,to my office and to the Australian Labour,83
NA,"Party in Melbourne, have said that, if they",83
NA,"are asked to distribute this document, this",83
NA,piece of paper that the Government has pro-,83
NA,"duced at public expense, they will also",83
NA,ensure that they distribute my pamphlet as,83
NA,well. Every second letter I open these days,83
NA,and have opened for five or six days con-,83
NA,tains a request for copies of the pamphlet,83
NA,that I wrote.,83
Mr SWARTZ ,Th e honorable member,83
NA,knows that is not right. That was corrected,83
NA,by the Prime Minister.,83
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Wha t was corrected?,83
Mr SWARTZ ,Th e allegation about dis-,83
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Ma y I state the,83
NA,made by position as I understand it?,83
Mr SWARTZ , A copy was sent to the,84
NA,headmaster of each school.,84
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Copie s were sent?,84
Mr SWARTZ ,On e copy.,84
Dr JF CAIRNS ,Tw o copies in some,84
NA,"Instances, because I know that is the num-",84
NA,ber that was received. The Prime Minister,84
NA,said the headmasters could have more,84
NA,copies if they wanted them.,84
Mr SWARTZ ,Tha t is right.,84
NA,Dr JF CAIRNS What did I say that,84
NA,was contrary to that? Perhaps the Minister,84
NA,can tell me. This is not thefirstpamphlet,84
NA,that I have seen distributed in schools. I,84
NA,remember that in the course of a teach-in,84
NA,"at Maribyrnong High School in Victoria, I",84
NA,"suppose six weeks ago, I saw a couple of",84
NA,hundred leaflets that had been published by,84
NA,the Liberal Party. They were ready for cir-,84
NA,culation to the boys and girls in the leaving,84
NA,and matriculation classes at Maribyrnong,84
NA,High School. They had been taken there,84
NA,"by former Senator Hannan. So, if any pre-",84
NA,cedent is wanted for the circulation of,84
NA,"political documents in schools, there is one.",84
NA,The point I make is that there is no justi-,84
NA,fication for the position apparently taken,84
NA,by the Prime Minister. He seeks to justify,84
NA,the circulation to headmasters at schools of,84
NA,the Liberal Party's pamphlet-tha t is all it,84
NA,can be called-whic h was produced at pub-,84
NA,lic expense and which contains the speeches,84
NA,of a number of Liberal Party members of,84
NA,"this Parliament, by alleging that my",84
NA,pamphlet had been circulated to schools. But,84
NA,"this is completely false, because my pam-",84
NA,phlet never has been.,84
NA,I said that I thank the honorable mem-,84
NA,ber for La Trobe and the Prime Minister for,84
NA,the publicity they have given to my leaflet.,84
NA,I hope they will do the same for a book I,84
NA,will have published on Hth December. It is,84
NA,"called "" Living with Asia"" and will be",84
NA,available through booksellers in the ordinary,84
NA,"way. I hope that the Prime Minister, the",84
NA,"honorable member for La Trobe, the honor-",84
NA,able member for Parkes ( Mr Hughes) and,84
NA,anyone else who wants to discuss the book,84
NA,will take advantage of the opportunity to,84
NA,do so. I believe it is most important that the,84
NA,war in Vietnam should be discussed. I,84
NA,believe it is important that pamphlets and,84
NA,books should be written about it. I approve,84
NA,even of the publication of the views of the,84
NA,Prime Minister and the Minister for,84
NA,"External Affairs ( Mr Hasluck), but not at",84
NA,public expense. If honorable members oppo-,84
NA,"site want to answer what I have done, let",84
NA,them to do it their own expense. They have,84
NA,a darn sight more money than I have. If,84
NA,they want to put their point of view to,84
NA,teachers or to anyone else in the com-,84
NA,"munity, let them do so at their own expense.",84
NA,That is precisely what we do.,84
NA,I welcome the publication of pamphlets,84
NA,and books. More of them on this subject,84
NA,"have never been published; there, is now a",84
NA,flood of them. The other day someone sent,84
NA,me the titles of three books that had been,84
NA,"recently published and said: "" I hope you",84
NA,will make sure that they are in the National,84
NA,"Library because, if these three books and",84
NA,most of those that have been published on,84
NA,Vietnam could be read even by members of,84
NA,"the Liberal Party, I think the truth would",84
NA,"eventually sink into their heads too."" I hope",84
NA,that every pamphlet and every book that,84
NA,has been written on this subject receives the,84
NA,widest publicity. I hope that we continue,84
NA,with this great national debate on the ques-,84
NA,tion of Vietnam which began with the teach-,84
NA,ins at the beginning of this year. I hope that,84
NA,what has been made available to university,84
NA,students in the form of teach-ins will be,84
NA,made available to the people of Australia.,84
NA,I conclude by challenging every memberof,84
NA,the Liberal Party and the Australian Coun-,84
NA,try Party in Victoria to meet me in a debate,84
NA,on Vietnam in their own electorates between,84
NA,now and the time that the Parliament re-,84
NA,assembles next year. I formally issue a chal-,84
NA,lenge to every member of the Liberal Party,84
NA,and the Australian Country Party in,84
NA,Victoria to meet me in debate in his own,84
NA,electorate in a teach-in for the people on the,84
NA,vastly important subject of Vietnam.,84
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,84
NA,House adjourned at 11.29 p.m.,84
NA,The following answers to questions,85
NA,Forestry Employees in Queensland.,85
NA,(Question No. 1356.),85
Mr HAYDEN , the Minister for,85
NA,"National Development, upon notice-",85
NA,1. Is he able to say whether the Queensland,85
NA,Government has undertaken a retrenchment of,85
NA,forestry workers which has already affected over,85
NA,200 employees?,85
NA,"2. If so, is it a fact that this action was",85
NA,necessitated because of a shortage of funds and is,85
NA,there little likelihood of the dismissed employees,85
NA,being re-engaged unless extra funds become avail-,85
NA,able?,85
NA,3. Have these dismissals in a number of in-,85
NA,stances resulted in staffs being reduced below,85
NA,what is regarded as the minimum level necessary,85
NA,"to maintain plantations, apart from carrying out",85
NA,forestry expansion policies? -,85
NA,4. Is it a fact that this retrenchment has,85
NA,occurred at a time when Australia should be,85
NA,engaged in stepping up its softwood planting,85
NA,programme if it is to have any hope of adequately,85
NA,supplying its own future needs?,85
NA,5. Will he consider taking steps.to grant special,85
NA,assistance to Queensland in order to avoid any,85
NA,harmful restriction of its forestry programme and,85
NA,to ensure that the employment of forestry workers,85
NA,in that State is not jeopardised?,85
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Th e answers to the hon-,85
NA,orable member's questions are as follows-,85
NA,"1, 2 and 3. I do understand that the Queens-",85
NA,land Government has undertaken a retrenchment,85
NA,of about this number of forestry employees. As,85
NA,this is essentially a State Government responsibility,85
NA,it would not be appropriate for me to comment,85
NA,on the reasons or precise results of this decision.,85
NA,4 and 5. The Australian Forestry Council has,85
NA,recommended that the softwood planting pro-,85
NA,gramme be stepped up as early as possible to,85
NA,"73,000 acres per annum. This recommendation",85
NA,and itsfinancialimplications are at present under,85
NA,active consideration by the Commonwealth and,85
NA,State Governments.,85
NA,(Question No. 1514.),85
Mr DALY , the Minister for Immi-,85

NA,under the new Act since the end of October and,85
NA,what has been the result of the prosecutions?,85
NA,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE.,85
NA,upon notice were circulated-,85
NA,Mr Opperman -Th e answers to the,85
NA,honorable member's questions are as,85
NA,follows-,85
NA,"1. (a) Notifications of address, occupation or",85
NA,employment and marital status have,85
NA,"been received from 283,735 aliens re-",85
NA,siding in Australia.,85
NA,"(b) Interstate movements of aliens, variations",85
NA,"of foreign names, etc., have made it a",85
NA,time-consuming process to reconcile,85
NA,notifications received with the index,85
NA,which is maintained on a State basis.,85
NA,"However, it has been established that",85
NA,"the overall figure of 396,012 aliens",85
NA,recorded in the index on 30th August,85
NA,1965 is an inflated one as deaths and,85
NA,departures have not always been noti-,85
NA,"fied. In view of this, it is not as yet",85
NA,possible to determine the actual num-,85
NA,ber who have not lodged notifications.,85
NA,2. Nil. Pending reconciliation of the notifications,85
NA,"received with the index, general prosecution action",85
NA,"cannot be taken. However, prosecutions will be",85
NA,launched in individual cases where default is con-,85

NA,"2. If so, what are ibe side effects of the drug?",85
NA,3. Are there any substitutes for the drug? If,85
NA,"so, what are the names of the substitutes?",85
Mr SWARTZ ,Th e answers to the honor-,85

NA,1. Yes. Sedormid tablets have been withdrawn,85
NA,"from the Australian market, having been declared",85

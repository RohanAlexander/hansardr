NA,PETITIONS,12
NA,National Service,12
NA,Mr BENSON presented a petition from,12
NA,certain citizens of the Commonwealth show-,12
NA,ing that the National Service Act 1968 is,12
NA,unduly harsh in that it (i) makes provision,12
NA,for the use of conscripted young men for,12
NA,overseas service; (ii) makes no allowance for,12
NA,conscientious objection to a particular war;,12
NA,(iii) provides an unduly harsh penalty of 2,12
NA,years gaol for those young men whose con-,12
NA,science compels them not to comply with,12
NA,the Act.,12
NA,The petitioners pray that the House of,12
NA,Representatives in Parliament assembled,12
NA,should respond to our plea for the early,12
NA,"repeal of the Act, and the immediate release",12
NA,of any young men who are now in prison,12
NA,as a result of their conscientious refusal to,12
NA,comply with the Act.,12

NA,Education,12
NA,Mr HANSEN presented a petition,12
NA,from certain citizens of Australia showing,12
NA,that there is a crisis in education in Aus-,12
NA,tralia; that a transformation of the class-,12
NA,"room situation is necessary, where children",12
NA,will have reasonable freedom to develop as,12
NA,"self-reliant, independent individuals and",12
NA,where they can learn to function as,12
NA,members of a democratic community;,12
NA,that proper preparation for school and,12
NA,thorough guidance there by qualified,12
NA,teachers are crucial to a proper education,12
NA,for Australia's children; that the present,12
NA,rate of teacher training is far below,12
NA,the requirement determined by the Martin,12
NA,Report which shows that 75% additional,12
NA,teachers in government schools alone will be,12
NA,required by 1975 compared with those in,12
NA,service in 1963; that to obtain maximum,12
NA,benefit from the education system pre-,12
NA,school facilities should be available to all,12
NA,children; that insufficient State or Federal,12
NA,assistance has been made available to meet,12
NA,these requirements; that adequatefinanceto,12

NA,Export of Merino Sheep,12
NA,Mr MUNRO presented a petition from,12
NA,certain electors of the Eden-Monaro Divi-,12
NA,sion showing that the decision of the Gov-,12
NA,ernment to lift the 40-year old ban on the,12
NA,export of merino rams will do irreparable,12
NA,harm to the present and future merino wool,12
NA,industry of Australia; that the initial quota,12
NA,of 300 rams will be suflicient to make any,12
NA,future protest worthless; and that the pro-,13
NA,duction of fine medium quality merino wool,13
NA,in cheap labour countries will put the Aus-,13
NA,tralian merino wool grower and all con-,13
NA,nected with this industry out of business.,13
NA,The petitioners pray that the Government,13
NA,will cause to be held a referendum of wool,13
NA,growers to determine this issue.,13
NA,Petition received.,13
NA,EDUCATION,13
Mr CALWELL,M y question is,13
NA,addressed to the Minister for Education and,13
NA,Science. 1 refer to the Minister's public,13
NA,support of colleges of advanced education,13
NA,and his claims that they should offer courses,13
NA,in no way inferior to those available at,13
NA,universities. As these colleges have been,13
NA,disadvantaged because they have originated,13
NA,from a depressed technical college system,13
NA,and as they will continue to be dis-,13
NA,advantaged because of limited contributions,13
NA,from the States owing to the financial diffi-,13
NA,"culties of the States, will the Government",13
NA,offer a generous and extensive programme,13
NA,of unmatched grants fo colleges for all,13
NA,development purposes in the next triennium,13
NA,and increase the Commonwealth contribu-,13
NA,tion to current expenditure of colleges to a,13
NA,$1 for $1 basis for that triennium?,13
Mr MALCOLM FRASER, I understand,13
NA,and sympathise with the thoughts behind,13
NA,the right honourable member's question and,13
NA,his desire to support the colleges of,13
NA,advanced education to a maximum extent.,13
NA,Reference was made to the fact that before,13
NA,the joint Commonwealth-State programmes,13
NA,resulted in greater support in this area of,13
NA,education these colleges were not getting,13
NA,thc proportion of funds that should have,13
NA,gone to them. That is quite correct. But the,13
NA,joint Commonwealth-State programmes,13
NA,have been designed to remedy the defects,13
NA,of the past. I believe that when we see the,13
NA,results of not only this triennium but also,13
NA,the ones that wfll follow we will see that,13
NA,the programmes are successful. The nature,13
NA,of the right honourable member's question,13
NA,suggests in part at least that the problems,13
NA,relating to these colleges are purely financial,13
NA,ones. This is certainly not so. There are,13
NA,"other problems as well, many of which",13
NA,stem from the background and origin of,13
NA,the colleges.,13
NA,A great deal of advocacy and work needs,13
NA,to be done to help build the status and,13
NA,prestige of the colleges so that they will be,13
NA,regarded not by a few but by a large pro-,13
NA,portion of the population as genuine and,13
NA,viable alternatives to universities. The view,13
NA,of parents and students is something that,13
NA,needs to be effective. The Commonwealth,13
NA,has appointed two committees which 1,13
NA,believe will play a significant part in helping,13
NA,to achieve these objectives. One is the,13
NA,"Wiltshire Committee, which I hope will be",13
NA,reporting soon on the nomenclature and,13
NA,standards of awards in the different colleges.,13
NA,Honourable members are no doubt aware,13
NA,that the standards vary greatly from one,13
NA,college to another. Mr Justice Sweeney is,13
NA,conducting an inquiry into the scale of,13
NA,salaries that should prevail in the colleges.,13
NA,I believe that this will add to the status of,13
NA,the professional staff at the colleges.,13
NA,One of the things that needs to be over-,13
NA,"come, and I think the right honourable",13
NA,"member's question refers to it, is the 3-acre",13
NA,or 5-acre inner suburban concept of the,13
NA,"colleges, with a large number of students",13
NA,housed on a small piece of ground. The,13
NA,plans encompassed in the first triennium,13
NA,envisage the relocation of these colleges,13
NA,over a period on much more adequate,13
NA,grounds and better sites so that they can,13
NA,expand and develop in a proper manner-,13
NA,much the same as universities-ove r a long,13
NA,period of time. But there is a limit to the,13
NA,rate of expansion that can be encompassed,13
NA,in a short period of time. There is not only,13
NA,a limit to the rate at which buildings can,13
NA,be constructed but also a limit to the rate,13
NA,at which well qualified staff can be recruited.,13
NA,I do not want to foreshadow what the,13
NA,Commonwealth's Advisory Committee on,13
NA,Advanced Education might recommend or,13
NA,predict what the Commonwealth's decisions,13
NA,"might be in relation to this matter, but I",13
NA,"firmly believe that the joint programmes,",13
NA,which will be supported by the Common-,13
NA,"wealth and the States for the next triennium,",13
NA,will take the colleges of advanced education,13
NA,a significant further step in the advance-,13
NA,ment of education in Australia.,13
NA,MILITARY DISCIPLINE,13
Mr GILES,M y question is addressed,13
NA,to the Minister for Defence. It refers to a,13
NA,statement he made in this House that an,13
NA,inter-dcpartmental committee would look,13
NA,into certain aspects of military detention. I,14
NA,ask: Has the Minister any progress report,14
NA,from this committee or any information to,14
NA,give to the House?,14
Mr FAIRHALL,l t is true that in 1968,14
NA,some complaints were made and questions,14
NA,were raised in the House concerning the,14
NA,treatment of members of the armed forces,14
NA,undergoing detention at Holsworthy. J,14
NA,"undertook then, on a promise given by the",14
NA,Deputy Leader of the Government who was,14
NA,"then Acting Prime Minister, to have the",14
NA,matter looked into. The result was that in,14
NA,"July 1968, I set up a committee of inquiry,",14
NA,"which was chaired by Mr F. J. Mahony,",14
NA,the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Sydney. Its,14
NA,"members were Mr J. A. Morony, the former",14
NA,Comptroller-General of Prisons in New,14
NA,"South Wales, Mr G. P. Temme of the",14
NA,"Department of Defence, and Brigadier O. H.",14
NA,"Isaksson, who was Deputy Adjutant-General",14
NA,"of the Department of the Army. In fact, the",14
NA,Committee has now finished its delibera-,14
NA,tions. It has produced a very detailed report,14
NA,on the question of Army detention and 1,14
NA,have already circulated the report to the,14
NA,Ministers of the three Services authorising,14
NA,tbem to put into operation immediately such,14
NA,recommendations as are easily manageable.,14
NA,"It will be clearly understood, I am sure,",14
NA,that there will be recommendations in the,14
NA,report that will call for some planning and,14
NA,"for some expenditure which will, in turn,",14
NA,"become a Budget matter. These matters, of",14
NA,"course, will have to be studied in a little",14
NA,"more depth. I take the opportunity, firstly,",14
NA,of saying how much we appreciate the,14
NA,services of the Committee in providing this,14
NA,very detailed report. For the benefit of the,14
NA,House and those who were critical at the,14
NA,"time, I am bound to say that the Com-",14
NA,mittee in its deliberations and investigations,14
NA,found no evidence of harsh treatment,14
NA,beyond the regulations in any of the Army,14
NA,detention camps. This was not a report to,14
NA,the Parliament; it was a report to me as,14
NA,"Minister for Defence, but for the benefit",14
NA,of honourable members I propose to lay,14
NA,a copy of the report on the table of the,14
NA,Parliamentary Library.,14
NA,RHODESIA,14
Mr WHITLAM,Th e Prime Minister will,14
NA,have noticed the visit of Air Vice-Marshal,14
NA,Hawkins to Australia. The Air Viceon,14
NA,Marshal is pictured on the front page,14
NA,the 'Australian' and elsewhere in the,14
NA,'Sydney Morning Herald' and the Mel-,14
NA,bourne 'Sun'. He was formerly Commander,14
NA,of the Rhodesian Air Force and he is to,14
NA,become Rhodesia's diplomatic representa-,14
NA,tive to South Africa. I recall the informa-,14
NA,tion which tbe Minister for Immigration,14
NA,gave me last August that an Australian,14
NA,passport had been issued to the Air Vice-,14
NA,Marshal as he had established that he had,14
NA,never lost his Australian citizenship. I now,14
NA,ask the right honourable gentleman whether,14
NA,he will make it plain that the Australian,14
NA,Government does not approve of an Aus-,14
NA,tralian citizen taking a position described,14
NA,as 'Rhodesia's diplomatic representative'.,14
Mr GORTON, I did notice the picture,14
NA,to which the Leader of the Opposition refers,14
NA,- a picture of an Australian who had had,14
NA,a most distinguished career fighting for the,14
NA,free world against Fascism as a pilot with,14
NA,great distinction and finishing up as the,14
NA,head of the air force of a country which,14
NA,"was then joined, I think with the approba-",14
NA,"tion of all of us, in opposing Hitler,",14
NA,Fascism and Fascist rule.,14
NA,Mr MCEwen-I t was a country in which,14
NA,some of our pilots were trained.,14
Mr GORTON,"Indeed , it was a coun-",14
NA,"try, I am reminded, in which many of our",14
NA,"pilots, who then went to fight against thi.s",14
NA,"aggressive Fascism, trained, just as they",14
NA,"trained in Canada, since we were all in the",14
NA,Empire Air Training Scheme together for,14
NA,the one objective. Having noticed that pic-,14
NA,"ture, I felt that that man bad had a career",14
NA,which was distinguished and which had,14
NA,greatly helped the freedom of thc world,14
NA,and the relief of Europe from conquest,14
NA,from abroad. I understand- I do not know,14
NA,this for certain-tha t he still is an Aus-,14
NA,"tralian citizen, and if he is an Australian",14
NA,citizen then he has a perfect right to visit,14
NA,"Australia. For the rest, I would ask the",14
NA,Minister for Immigration for any further,14
NA,information.,14
NA,METRIC SYSTEM,14
Mr DRURY,I s the Prime Minister,14
NA,aware that the New Zealand Government,14
NA,has decided to adopt the metric system of,14
NA,weights and measures? Has the Govern-,14
NA,ment considered the unanimous recom-,14
NA,mendations of the Senate Select Committee,14
NA,the Metric System of Weights and,14
NA,of Measures regarding the desirability of,14
NA,"introducing this system into Australia? If so,",15
NA,can the Prime Minister give the House any,15
NA,indication as to when an announcement,15
NA,might be expected?,15
Mr GORTON, 1 was not aware that the,15
NA,New Zealand Governnient had decided to,15
NA,adopt the metric system of weights and,15
NA,measures nor am I aware-althoug h perhaps,15
NA,the honourable member can later enlighten,15
NA,me-whethe r it has determined any time-,15
NA,"table for such adoption. For all I know,",15
NA,"it may be 10, 15 or 20 years ahead. 1 do",15
NA,not know. I would be surprised if the sug-,15
NA,gestion were that it was to be rapidly,15
NA,"adopted, although that might be so. The",15
NA,report from tbe Senate Select Committee,15
NA,has not yet been considered in detail by the,15
NA,"Cabinet, although it has been looked at by",15
NA,various public servants who wili make,15
NA,recommendations to the Government. It,15
NA,involves very great expense. It involves,15
NA,siderable disruption. It could well lead in,15
NA,the long run to advantages to Australia. But,15
NA,"that, 1 think, is all I can say in response",15
NA,to the honourable member's question at this,15
NA,moment.,15
NA,TAXATION,15
Mr GRIFFITHS, I ask the Treasurer,15
NA,whether it is a fact that recently the Com-,15
NA,missioner of Taxation gave a ruling that,15
NA,expenses incurred in the removal of night-,15
NA,soil and effluent from dwellings in un-,15
NA,sewered areas by councils and shires was not,15
NA,an allowable deduction under section 72(1),15
NA,of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Does,15
NA,this mean that thousands of taxpayers who,15
NA,own properties in' unsewered areas arc to,15
NA,"be deprived of thc opportunity to deduct,",15
NA,"for tax purposes, sanitary expenses which",15
NA,are charged each year by councils and,15
NA,"shires, simply because section 72(1) of the",15
NA,Act does not specifically include the words,15
NA,'sanitary expenses'? In view of the im-,15
NA,"portance of the Commissioner's ruling,",15
NA,"especially to low income earners, will he",15
NA,"have seciion 72 (I) of the Act reviewed and,",15
NA,"if necessary, amended so that all rate-",15
NA,payers will enjoy equality in taxation con-,15
NA,cessions in respect of rates?,15
Mr MCMAHON, I was not aware of the,15
NA,ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation. I,15
NA,"will have a review made of the decision, as",15
NA,"the honourable member suggests, if in fact",15
NA,it was made. Later on I will see what is,15
NA,be done in a budget context.,15
NA,TELEVISION,15
Mr CALDER,M y question is addressed,15
NA,to the Postmaster-General. I refer to a,15
NA,recent announcement by the Chairman of,15
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Commission,15
NA,that Darwin would receive television trans-,15
NA,mission-a n amenity whkh I have been,15
NA,constantly advocating for the Northern,15
NA,Territory. I ask the Postmaster-General,15
NA,whether he can advise me of the approxi-,15
NA,mate date when the television station will be,15
NA,established. Could he also inform me,15
NA,whether consideration is also being given,15
NA,to the establishment of an ABC television,15
NA,station at Alice Springs?,15
NA,Mr HULME;-Member s of the House,15
NA,will recollect that some months ago i,15
NA,indicated that approval had been given for,15
NA,the erection of national television stations,15
NA,"at Kalgoorlie, Geraldton, the Upper",15
NA,"conMurray, Mount Isa and Darwin. The instru-",15
NA,mentalities responsible for this-th e Post,15
NA,"Oflice, the ABC and the Australian Broad-",15
NA,casting Control Board-ar e at the moment,15
NA,designing the transmitter siies and buildings,15
NA,and making preparations for the calling of,15
NA,tenders for the construction of these instal-,15
NA,lations. I understand that it is expected that,15
NA,Ihe Darwin station will be brought on air,15
NA,in the early part of 1971. Recently the,15
NA,Australian Broadcasting Control Board,15
NA,made recommendations to me in regard to,15
NA,other smaller centres. By the time the five,15
NA,stations I have already mentioned come on,15
NA,air no less than 96% of the Australian,15
NA,population will have television available to,15
NA,"them. The other 4% of the population,",15
NA,"roughly 500,000 people, are distributed",15
NA,over a large number of different areas. A,15
NA,plan for further extensions of television,15
NA,services has been put before me and the,15
NA,Governnient. The centres covered by this,15
NA,"plan include Alice Springs, which is one",15
NA,of the larger of the centres at present not,15
NA,provided with television services. We will,15
NA,adopt the plan as far as it affects Alice,15
NA,"Springs and certain other areas, and I hope",15
NA,that in the not too distant future I will be,15
NA,able to make a more definite statement on,15
NA,this matter.,15
NA,MEAT AND DAIRY EXPORTS,15
Mr DUTHIE,I s the Minister for,15
NA,Primary Industry aware that the American,15
NA,to Department of Agriculture has placed a ban,15
NA,on the import of meat and dairy products,15
NA,from certain areas ef Australia because,16
NA,pesticide poison has been found in the pro-,16
NA,ducts? One Tasmanian firm has been affected,16
NA,"by this prohibition, and exporters from other",16
NA,States have had certain of their shipments of,16
NA,foodstuffs condemned in America because,16
NA,they have been affected by pesticide poison.,16
NA,"Because of the dangers, isolated and rare",16
NA,"as they are at present, of foodstuffs being",16
NA,affected by pesticides used for spraying pas-,16
NA,"tures, with the resultant impact on the",16
NA,American market,16
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The honourable,16
NA,niember will ask his question.,16
Mr DUTHIE,Wil l the Federal Govern-,16
NA,ment ban altogether the use of pesticides,16
NA,that have a DDT component?,16
Mr ANTHONY,I t is true that the,16
NA,American Administration bans any meat,16
NA,"which contains certain insecticidal residues,",16
NA,"particularly DDT, and certain organic phos-",16
NA,"phates. The Commonwealth Government,",16
NA,"however, has no authority to ban the use of",16
NA,certain chemicals; this comes under the con-,16
NA,trol of State health authorities. But where,16
NA,certain exports are implicated my Depart-,16
NA,ment consults with State departments. A,16
NA,sub-committee of the Australian Agricul-,16
NA,tural Council constantly reviews the question,16
NA,of insecticides and acaricides and if it is,16
NA,found undesirable to use any of these the,16
NA,State departments are asked to place a pro-,16
NA,hibition on their use. I am led to believe,16
NA,that in Tasmania there is a ban on the use,16
NA,of DDT for the control of certain pasture,16
NA,grubs. If this is not being complied with I,16
NA,will certainly look into the matter.,16
NA,AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURE,16
Mr ANDREW JONES,I s the Minister,16
NA,for Trade and Industry aware that the head,16
NA,of the Italian Fiat organisation is due to,16
NA,"arrive in Auslralia shortly? If so, can the",16
NA,Minister undertake to arrange discussions,16
NA,between the gentleman concerned and,16
NA,Federal and State government authorities,16
NA,interested in the local manufacture of auto-,16
NA,mobiles? Will the Minister advise whether,16
NA,to date any discussions have taken place,16
NA,between his Department and the Fiat cor-,16
NA,poration with a view to investment in Aus-,16
NA,tralia by that organisation for manufacIndustry,16
NA,turing purposes?,16
Mr MCEWEN, I am not aware that an,16
NA,executive of the Fiat organisation is coming,16
NA,"here in the near future, but a few weeks",16
NA,ago one of the principal owners of the Fiat,16
NA,"organisation, whose name escapes me at",16
NA,"the moment, was in Australia. By courtesy",16
NA,of the Italian Ambassador I met him and,16
NA,had conversations with him. 1 discussed the,16
NA,possibility of the Fiat organisation com-,16
NA,"mencing operations in Australia, in respect",16
NA,of the manufacture of either motor vehicles,16
NA,"or tractors, and 1 proffered him all the",16
NA,assistance that the Department of Trade,16
NA,and Industry could give in studying what,16
NA,"would be involved, what the prospects",16
NA,"would be, and a comprehension of Austra-",16
NA,lian Government policies. It would be quite,16
NA,consistent with that assurance that an exe-,16
NA,cutive of that corporation should come to,16
NA,Australia. The company already knows tbat,16
NA,the good offices of my Department will be,16
NA,available to it. I have no doubt that the,16
NA,"Fiat organisation, which I think exists in",16
NA,Australia on an agency basis at the present,16
NA,"time, is aware that it is the constant prac-",16
NA,tice of the Department of Trade and,16
NA,Industry to stand ready to discuss this,16
NA,kind of business with entrepreneurs or,16
NA,manufacturers.,16
NA,INFLATION,16
Mr WEBB,M y question is directed to,16
NA,the Treasurer. I refer to the Minister's con-,16
NA,cern about inflation and ask him whether,16
NA,he supports the Chairman of the Metal,16
NA,Trades Federation who has suggested a curb,16
NA,on wages. Has the Treasurer taken into,16
NA,account Mr Justice Moore's comment in his,16
NA,reasons for judgment in 1964 when he said,16
NA,that increases in prices are determined by,16
NA,"those who fix prices, and that there was no",16
NA,authoritative control of prices whilst there,16
NA,was a tight control on wages? Will he con-,16
NA,sider consulting State authorities on the in-,16
NA,troduction of price control?,16
Mr MCMAHON,Th e honourable mem-,16
NA,ber introduces a subject of great profound-,16
NA,ness and complexity. He may rest assured,16
NA,that I will very carefully consider what he,16
NA,"has said, and if there is anything I can do",16
NA,about it I will do it.,16
NA,TEXTILE INDUSTRY,16
Mr LEE,I s the Minister for Trade and,16
NA,aware that the future of city and,16
NA,country clothing factories is being threatened,16
NA,by an unparalleled increase in imports of,17
NA,children's clothing which is coming from,17
NA,"Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong? The",17
NA,toddler's suit I hold in my hand is made in,17
NA,Australia and sells at $3.66 in the shops.,17
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! I think the garasked,17
NA,ment has had enough advertising.,17
Mr LEE,I s the Minister aware that garhonourable,17
NA,ments similar to this one are being imported,17
NA,"from overseas and retailed at only $1,",17
NA,that this will have disastrous results in cloth-,17
NA,"ing factories, especially in country towns",17
NA,where it is difncult for girls to obtain,17
NA,employment? Is it a fact that in some cases,17
NA,completed garments are imported at a,17
NA,lower rate of duty than is the material,17
NA,which Australian manufacturers have to,17
NA,make similar garments?,17
Mr MCEWEN,Th e Australian clothing,17
NA,industry has been protected by means,17
NA,"the Australian tariff for many years and, as",17
NA,"have said on many occasions, I would",17
NA,that if in the future the producers of Austra-,17
NA,lian textiles or garments felt that they were,17
NA,threatened by undue imports from overseas,17
NA,they would ask the Minister for Trade and,17
NA,Industry to study their case and if necessary,17
NA,refer it to the Tariff Board. These are,17
NA,"procedures which stand today, but if urgent",17
NA,action is necessary to protect an industry,17
NA,before the matter goes to the Tariff Board,17
NA,it can be referred to the Special Advisory,17
NA,Authority. This can be done quite expedand,17
NA,itiously and the law requires the Special,17
NA,Advisory Authority to make a report within,17
NA,"30 days. About 15 months ago, following",17
NA,representations by local manufacturers,17
NA,in accordance with the recommendation,17
NA,"the Special Advisory Authority, temporary",17
NA,protection by means of a quantitative,17
NA,triction was imposed on imports of a,17
NA,of knitted outer garments. More recently,17
NA,requests were received for temporary pro-,17
NA,tection of knitted shirts. The latter request,17
NA,is receiving serious consideration at the,17
NA,sent time. I know that in the last few days,17
NA,have referred to the Special Advisory,17
NA,Authority an item of knitted goods. My,17
NA,memory fails me at the moment as to what,17
NA,particular category of knitted goods it was.,17
NA,Mr Stewart-Shirts .,17
Mr MCEWEN,Than k you. Apart from objective,17
NA,"these instances, I have received",17
NA,industry producing children's clothing no,17
NA,application for increased assistance. If such,17
NA,an application is received from the industry,17
NA,it will receive my urgent consideration. May,17
NA,I say in respect of this matter that 1 was,17
NA,delighted on my last visit to Japan to be,17
NA,to open in Tokyo a display of Aus-,17
NA,tralian textiles manufactured in the town of,17
NA,"Seymour, in the electorate to which the",17
NA,member for Lalor aspires. There,17
NA,we are manufacturing textiles and we are,17
NA,and selling them competitively in Japan.,17
NA,SOUTH VIETNAM,17
Mr BARNARD,M y question is directed,17
NA,much to the Minister for the Army. I refer,17
NA,from the honourable gentleman to his reported,17
NA,statement that the Australian Task Force,17
NA,has made the Phuoc Tuy province relatively,17
NA,"secure in the past 3 years, l f the province",17
NA,of bas been secured why has the Australian,17
NA,I medical team at the Baria hospital been with-,17
NA,expect drawn for security reasons?,17
Mr LYNCH,Th e honourable gentleman,17
NA,is in fact asking me to justify my recent,17
NA,statement that the province of Phuoc Tuy,17
NA,"is today relatively secure, a statement which",17
NA,the was made on the best advice available to,17
NA,this Government. Let me say at the outset,17
NA,that when the Task Force first went to tbe,17
NA,province on lst May 1966 it was literally,17
NA,"dominated and controlled by the Vietcong,",17
NA,they had reached tbis position as a,17
NA,consequence of acts of terror and assassina-,17
NA,tion. The honourable gentleman will,17
NA,be aware that our area of responsi-,17
NA,and bility was the greater part of the,17
NA,"by province and some adjacent areas,",17
NA,although it has always been under-,17
NA,resstood that the Task Force was available,17
NA,range for deployment anywhere in III Corps,17
NA,zone and also in Binh Thuan in II Corps,17
NA,"zone, and it has been so deployed in recent",17
NA,premonths. The role of the Task Force in the,17
NA,I province was the pursuit and destruction,17
NA,of the enemy main force units attempting,17
NA,to further infiltrate the province and to,17
NA,"attack the developing towns, villages and",17
NA,agricultural areas. I say that in pushing the,17
NA,Vietcong away from the more populated,17
NA,areas the Task Force undeniably has assisted,17
NA,the South Vietnamese Government in its,17
NA,of improving the security and the,17
NA,from the lot of its people.,17
NA,I also say that concurrently with the mili-,18
NA,tary performance of our troops in this,18
NA,province our diversified form of civil aid,18
NA,has made an important contribution to,18
NA,improving the general living conditions of,18
NA,"the South Vietnamese people. Finally, in",18
NA,terms of the contribution we have made,18
NA,towards security In the area,18
Mr BARNARD ,Wha t about the hospital?,18
Mr SPEAKER,Order !,18
Mr LYNCH,I f the honourable gentleteam,18
NA,man will give me a moment or so 1 will,18
NA,come to that point at a later stage. Let,18
NA,say on the third point that apart from our,18
NA,military performance and apart from the,18
NA,civic action work as in other,18
NA,"country, of course, our team of Army",18
NA,advisers has made a first-class contribution,18
NA,to the training of the Army of the,18
NA,of Vietnam forces and the improved per-,18
NA,formance of those forces is in some way due,18
NA,to the contribution which we have made.,18
NA,Everyone witb whom I spoke in South,18
NA,"Vietnam, whether they were South I have",18
NA,"Vietnamese military or civil authorities,",18
NA,"own authorities, military or civil, or United",18
NA,"States authorities, military or civil, agreed",18
NA,that according to the latest estimates the,18
NA,province of Phuoc Tuy is today relatively,18
NA,secure and that the people are able generally be exposed.,18
NA,to go about their business free from danger.,18
NA,Let me also say that as a result of opera-,18
NA,tions in the province the enemy has been,18
NA,forced to withdraw to areas from which,18
NA,is difficult for him to mount and launch,18
NA,attacks of any strength or duration. For,18
NA,the purpose of informing the honourable,18
NA,"gentleman, I emphasise the words 'of any",18
NA,strength or duration' because at no time,18
NA,have 1 or any member of this Government,18
NA,said that the enemy bad no capability to,18
NA,"mount attacks. On the contrary,",18
NA,a number of occasions made it quite clear,18
NA,that the enemy still retains the capacity to,18
NA,mount sneak attacks and sporadic raids,18
NA,this in no way contradicts the judgment,18
NA,made on the basis of the assessment of,18
NA,many competent observers that the degree,18
NA,of security in Phuoc Tuy is immeasurably,18
NA,improved if one compares the position 3,18
NA,years ago or even 1 year ago. I say further,18
NA,to the honourable gentleman that he com3,18
NA,pletely overlooks a number of the major,18
NA,advances which the Australians and the,18
NA,allied forces have made. He overlooks the,18
NA,strength of the forces of the ARVN. He,18
NA,overlooks the quite staggering losses which,18
NA,the Army has suffered since this offensive,18
NA,began. He overlooks also the fact that to,18
NA,this stage the enemy has been unable to,18
NA,mount the major offensive planned to ba,18
NA,mounted earlier this year. He overlooks the,18
NA,strengthening political base of the Govern-,18
NA,ment of South Vietnam. The honourable,18
NA,"gentleman has queried, as presumably the",18
NA,only semblance of fact that he can produce,18
NA,"to this House, the reason why our medical",18
NA,bas been withdrawn from Baria. Of,18
NA,"course, this is a matter which is really the",18
NA,"me prerogative of my colleague, the Acting",18
NA,"Minister for External Affairs, but might I",18
NA,take the opportunity of saying briefly to the,18
NA,parts of the honourable gentleman,18
Mr SPEAKER, I would appreciate it if,18
NA,Republic the Minister would be brief.,18
Mr LYNCH,"Briefly , the medical team",18
NA,was withdrawn because of a situation which,18
NA,followed a sneak raid of the type to which,18
NA,earlier referred. It was the judgment,18
NA,our of the Government that the situation to,18
NA,which the medical team was exposed was,18
NA,not consistent with the degree of risk to,18
NA,which Australian civilians involved in what,18
NA,is essentially a humanitarian task ought to,18
NA,SHIPBUILDING,18
Mr JESSOP,Wil l the Minister for Ship-,18
NA,it ping and Transport say whether approval,18
NA,has been given for the construction for the,18
NA,"R. W. Miller organisation of a 62,000 tons",18
NA,tanker at the Whyalla shipyards of the,18
NA,Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd? If approval has,18
NA,been given will the Minister indicate when,18
NA,work on the vessel might begin and whether,18
NA,any likelihood exists of other such vessels,18
NA,I have on being built at Whyalla?,18
Mr SINCLAIR,Th e tender submitted,18
NA,but by the Whyalla shipyards of the Broken,18
NA,Hill Pty Co. Ltd for the construction of,18
NA,"a 62,000 tons deadweight vessel for the",18
NA,R. W. Miller organisation has been,18
NA,accepted. Preliminary planning and design,18
NA,of the vessel have started. The construction,18
NA,of the vessel is expected to commence in,18
NA,or 4 months. At this stage I am not sura,18
NA,of the expected date of completion. It is,18
NA,true also that prospects exist for the con-,18
NA,struction of other vessels of this size or even,18
NA,larger. If this happens it will once again,19
NA,augur very bright prospects for the shiparticle,19
NA,building industry in Australia.,19
NA,SUPERANNUATION,19
Mr WHITLAM, I ask the Treasurer a,19
NA,question about the Commonwealth Super-,19
NA,annuation Fund and the Defence Forces,19
NA,Retirement Benefits Fund. How soon will,19
NA,the Treasurer bring down legislation relating,19
NA,to the Commonwealth Superannuation conduct,19
NA,"Fund, which he promised in a ministerial",19
NA,"statement made 5 months ago? In particular,",19
NA,will public servants who retire between the,19
NA,time of making the statement and the,19
NA,passing of the legislation be granted the,19
NA,benefits of the legislation? Since it is taking,19
NA,much longer than expected to make the,19
NA,distribution dealt with 5 months ago in,19
NA,the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits,19
NA,"Bill, why has an interim distribution paycalculation",19
NA,ment not been made from the Defence,19
NA,Forces Retirement Benefits Fund as has,19
NA,been done in the past from the Superother,19
NA,annuation Fund?,19
Mr MCMAHON,Whe n the honourable use,19
NA,gentleman asked the first part of this,19
NA,tion one of my colleagues behind me said:,19
NA,'Is he getting very anxious about his future?' Australia.,19
NA,As to the matters raised by the honourable,19
NA,"gentleman, I have already, in answering",19
NA,"questions in the House, referred to",19
NA,difficulties associated with the legislation,19
NA,referred to. Whenever I have been asked,19
NA,about these matters I have said that we are,19
NA,doing our best to expedite them. The respect,19
NA,honourable gentleman may rest assured,19
NA,that as soon as question time is over I will,19
NA,again approach the ofncials involved in this,19
NA,matter and see whether I can do anything,19
NA,to expedite action.,19
NA,INTERNATIONAL GRAINS,19
NA,' ARRANGEMENT,19
Mr ARMSTRONG,Ha s the attention in,19
NA,of the Minister for Trade and Industry been,19
NA,drawn to a newspaper article which stated,19
NA,this week that Australia has greatly contrinational,19
NA,buted to the collapse of the minimum price,19
NA,regulations,19
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The honourable,19
NA,member will not quote from a newspaper.,19
NA,He can refer to it sufficiently to make his,19
NA,question understandable.,19
Mr ARMSTRONG,Th e newspaper,19
NA,states that Australia has greatly con-,19
NA,tributed to the collapse of the minimum,19
NA,price regulations of the International Grains,19
NA,Arrangement. Is this statement correct?,19
Mr MCEWEN, I have not personally,19
NA,"read the statement, but officers of my",19
NA,Department have informed me of it. To the,19
NA,extent that it is an allegation that Australian,19
NA,has contributed to a likely break-,19
NA,down of the International Grains Arrange-,19
NA,"ment, this is utterly untrue and utterly",19
NA,incorrect. The present International Grains,19
NA,"Arrangement, unlike previous ones, has a",19
NA,rather complex basis for pricing. It not only,19
NA,takes into account the various grades and,19
NA,"qualities of wheat, but it is based upon a",19
NA,fixed price for a number of grades of wheat,19
NA,at American gulf ports. From that there is a,19
NA,of freight to certain destinations,19
NA,"of the wheat from America, and a complex",19
NA,formula of calculations of freight for any,19
NA,exporter from any other port to any,19
NA,other country. An argument has prevailed,19
NA,as to whether Australia has been able to,19
NA,freights other than those which might be,19
NA,quesaccepted as the normal freight. That is,19
NA,the only basis of any allegation about,19
NA,I think there have been allegations against,19
NA,the other countries-perhap s not Canada; I,19
NA,would not make any allegations about,19
NA,Canada. In the United States the Govern-,19
NA,ment enters into an international contract in,19
NA,of wheat and then permits the inter-,19
NA,national trading of wheat to be in private,19
NA,"bands, and there have been strong allegations",19
NA,that the trading of wheat by Americans has,19
NA,been contrived privately in a manner to,19
NA,avoid the minimum price specifications.,19
NA,"There have been allegations, in respect of the",19
NA,export of wheat by the European Economic,19
NA,"Community, concerning the avoidance of",19
NA,the obligation. There have been allegations,19
NA,respect of the export of wheat from the,19
NA,Argentine. I regard these matters as teeth-,19
NA,ing troubles in a great and complex inter-,19
NA,agreement covering one of the,19
NA,major internationally traded commodities.,19
NA,When it was brought to my notice that,19
NA,this controversy was proceeding I imme-,19
NA,diately said that T did not intend to have,19
NA,"Australia suspected, let alone breaking the",19
NA,"rides, and that what we sbould do should",19
NA,be to have the major trading nations gather,20
NA,"together, discuss the problems which were",20
NA,tormenting each of them and arrive at an,20
NA,"agreed solution. That discussion, which was",20
NA,held at the level of very senior public ser-,20
NA,"vants, in the presence of members or repre-",20
NA,sentatives of the Australian Wheat Board,20
NA,"in the case of Australia, took place in",20
NA,"Washington, 1 think, while the Prime Minis-",20
NA,ter himself was over there. This is a very,20
NA,complex ...alter and it has not involved Aus-,20
NA,tralia alone. As a result of the discussion,20
NA,"1 have mentioned, all the nations agreed",20
NA,that Ihey were determined to sustain the,20
NA,International Grains Arrangement. They,20
NA,agreed that they would individually study,20
NA,very carefully the operation of their own,20
NA,trading arrangements to ensure that none,20
NA,of them as individuals could properly be,20
NA,alleged to be impairing the International,20
NA,Grains Arrangement. 1 do not think there,20
NA,could be a better outcome than that for the,20
NA,Arrangement and for Australia's interest.,20
NA,I think that the writer of the article to,20
NA,which thc honourable member referred is,20
NA,"Mr Donath, who is a lecturer at the Univer-",20
NA,sity of Melbourne. All the articles I have,20
NA,read by Mr Donath have been adverse to,20
NA,the interests of Ihe Australian wheat,20
NA,industry. He does noi believe that the Aus-,20
NA,tralian wheat industry should be supported,20
NA,or that the Australian wheat industry should,20
NA,be allowed to expand. He is living in the,20
NA,world of Adam Smilh of .150 years ago,20
NA,when it was assumed as pure economic,20
NA,theory that items should be produced only,20
NA,by those who could produce them most,20
NA,economically and that those who could not,20
NA,produce ns economically as others should,20
NA,refrain from producing and should pur-,20
NA,chase from someone else. This is pure,20
NA,economic theory which does not belong to,20
NA,"this age, this century or this generation at",20
NA,all. I just take no notice of Mr Donalh's,20
NA,writing.,20
NA,WHEAT,20
Mr LUCHETTI, I ask the Minister for,20
NA,Primary Industry to tell the Parliament and,20
NA,the Australian wheat growers the Govern-,20
NA,ment's grain production targets for the,20
NA,current season. WiJI he say what decisions,20
NA,have been made in respect of production,20
NA,control and to what extent production is to,20
NA,be restricted? Does the Minister realise that,20
NA,to delay clear-cut decisions now may result,20
NA,in chaotic conditions at harvest time? Is the,20
NA,Minister able to indicate any substantial,20
NA,storage plans for this year's surplus wheat,20
NA,or whether there will be new marketing pro-,20
NA,posals or any other propositions to dispose,20
NA,of all of our surplus production?,20
Mr ANTHONY,I t is not the Govern-,20
NA,ment's policy to determine production,20
NA,targets or the extent of production,20
NA,of this commodity or that commodity.,20
NA,These are matters for the primary indus-,20
NA,"tries themselves to determine, lt is a matter",20
NA,even for the individual grower to decide,20
NA,what he should produce and how much of,20
NA,it he should produce. Even if this Govern-,20
NA,"ment wished to make such decision;., it",20
NA,would have no authority under the Con-,20
NA,"stitution to do so, because such matters lie",20
NA,within the jurisdiction of the States. How-,20
NA,"ever, I have been warning the wheat indus-",20
NA,try for some time that there will be great,20
NA,difficulties in delivery and disposal of this,20
NA,season's crop if it attains anything like the,20
NA,dimensions of last year's crop and if we,20
NA,are unable to dispose of it at any greater,20
NA,rate than we have been able to achieve,20
NA,in the past 2 or 3 years. As a result of my,20
NA,warnings the Australian Wheatgrowers,20
NA,Federation has studied the matter in great,20
NA,detail and brought forward a proposal to,20
NA,apply a quota system in respect of the,20
NA,delivery of wheat lo the terminals. This pro-,20
NA,posal is contingent upon the Government,20
NA,providing a first advance of $1.10 a bushel,20
NA,for a certain quantity of wheat and on the,20
NA,State governments implementing such a,20
NA,proposal.,20
NA,At tbis point of lime it appears that there,20
NA,will be a carry-over of 250 million bushels,20
NA,in the silos when this year's crop is to be,20
NA,harvested. The total storage space in this,20
NA,country is sufficient for about 517 million,20
NA,bushels. This means that only about 270,20
NA,million bushels can be accepted at the ter-,20
NA,minals. When we realise that last year's,20
NA,"production was about 530 million bushels,",20
NA,"of which 505 million bushels was delivered,",20
NA,we can appreciate that this year there will,20
NA,be an awful lot of wheat left on the farms,20
NA,because it will be impossible to deliver it,20
NA,to the terminals. Without some orderly,20
NA,system of deliveries there would be ulter,20
NA,chaos and the proposal that the Federation,20
NA,has put forward is designed to bring about,20
NA,some orderly delivery system. But even,20
NA,under that proposal it will be necessary to,20
NA,build additional storages for approximately,21
NA,90 million bushels. The responsibility for,21
NA,storage of wheat is that of the bulk handling,21
NA,"authorities and tbe Australian Wheat Board,",21
NA,and it will be up to these bodies to provide,21
NA,additional space. But additional space means,21
NA,"additional money, and the people who will",21
NA,provide this money are the wheat growers.,21
NA,"So, it is a decision they will have to take.",21
NA,They will have to meet their obligations. I,21
NA,know that the Wheat Board and the bulk,21
NA,handling authorities are examining this,21
NA,matter. No doubt they will take into account,21
NA,the facts that I have revealed to the House.,21
NA,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,21
NA,ORGANISATION CONVENTIONS,21
NA,Discussion of matter of Public Importance,21
Mr SPEAKER, I have received a letter,21
NA,from the honourable member for Stirling,21
NA,( Mr Webb) proposing that a definite matter,21
NA,of public importance be submitted to,21
NA,"House for discussion, namely:",21
NA,The Government's disappointing record on the,21
NA,ratification and appUcation of International Labour,21
NA,Organisation Conventions.,21
NA,I call upon those members who approve of,21
NA,the proposed discussion to rise in their,21
NA,places.,21
NA,(More than the number of members,21
NA,required by the Standing Orders having risen,21
NA,in their places),21
Mr WEBB ,Stirling) [3.27]-I n raising,21
NA,this matter of public importance I draw,21
NA,attention of honourable members to the,21
NA,chart of International Labour Organisation,21
NA,ratifications dated lst June 1968. The chart,21
NA,shows that the Australian Government,21
NA,disappointing record in regard to the rati-,21
NA,fication and application of ILO conventions.,21
NA,The International Labour Organisation was,21
NA,"es abiished in 1919. So, this is the fiftieth",21
NA,year of its existence. During that half,21
NA,century the ILO bas been able to formulate,21
NA,over 128 separate conventions on labour national,21
NA,and social questions. These international,21
NA,labour standards have been ratified on such,21
NA,a scale that the total number of ratifications,21
NA,at the Slst Session in 1967 had reached fewer,21
NA,"3,356. The question of actual performance",21
NA,is being raised with increasing insistence.,21
NA,The adoption of international legislation,21
NA,its formal acceptance by an increasing,21
NA,number of countries does not add to the,21
NA,growing stability of relations between states,21
NA,unless the contracting parties comply with,21
NA,their obligations. Under the ILO's constitu-,21
NA,tion annual reports are required on the,21
NA,effect given to the ILO instruments. At the,21
NA,1964 Conference the Director-General of,21
NA,the ILO said:,21
NA,We must scrupulously safeguard lhe rigorous,21
NA,supervision over the application of ILO standards.,21
NA,This is essential to the integrity of the Organisation,21
NA,and to the self-respect of the member-states,21
NA,which have through it undertaken international,21
NA,obligations.,21
NA,What has been the impact of ILO super-,21
NA,vision on governments which have been,21
NA,found to infringe their treaty obligations?,21
NA,Breaches of obligations are not deemed to,21
NA,have been eliminated when a government,21
NA,has merely voiced its intention to initiate,21
NA,the necessary measures or has introduced,21
NA,draft legislation. They are only deemed to,21
NA,have been eliminated when concrete action,21
NA,has been taken. The ILO's constitution,21
NA,devotes twenty-four of its forty articles,21
NA,"the to the preparation, adoption and imple-",21
NA,mentation of ILO standards.,21
NA,Adoption of a decision in the form of,21
NA,a convention or a recommendation requires,21
NA,a majority of two-thirds bf the votes cast,21
NA,by the delegates. This indicates that decisions,21
NA,are not taken lightly. This is further borne,21
NA,out by the fact that each member country,21
NA,has a delegation of four persons-tw o,21
NA,"government delegates, one employers' dele-",21
NA,gate and one workers' delegate. I bad the,21
NA,honour of representing Australia at the 1.959,21
NA,the ILO Conference as a workers' delegate.,21
NA,Over the past 49 years-th e fiftieth annual,21
NA,session has not yet been held-th e ILO,21
NA,"Conference, as I have already mentioned,",21
NA,has a has formulated 128 conventions.,21
NA,We come now to the attitude of this,21
NA,Government to its obligations to ILO. In a,21
NA,previous debate I stated that as at 3rd June,21
NA,1963 the International Labour Organisation,21
NA,had made 118 conventions of which Aus-,21
NA,tralia had ratified only 25. The inter-,21
NA,"chart of ratifications, which is dated",21
NA,lst June 1968- 5 years later-show s that,21
NA,the ILO has ratified 128 conventions but,21
NA,"Australia has ratified only 26, which is",21
NA,than one-fifth of the total ratifications.,21
NA,It is interesting to note that the United,21
NA,"Kingdom has ratified 60, France 79, Italy",21
NA,"and 67, The Netherlands 63 and New Zealand",21
NA,44. Australia's sorry record is revealed by,21
NA,the fact that although it has been a member,21
NA,of the ILO since its inception in 1919 it,21
NA,bas ratified only 26 of the 128 conventions.,22
NA,Time does not permit me to deal with all,22
NA,the conventions that have not been ratified,22
NA,by the Australian Government. Some of,22
NA,them will be dealt with by other speakers,22
NA,"from the Opposition, but I refer to just",22
NA,"a few: Convention 105, Abolition of",22
NA,"Forced Labour; 107, Indigenous and Tribal",22
NA,"Populations; 115, Radiation Protection; 101,",22
NA,"Holidays with Pay (Agriculture); and 99,",22
NA,Minimum Wage Fixing (Agriculture). So I,22
NA,could go on. But let me say something about,22
NA,"Convention 100, Equal Remuneration, and",22
NA,"111, Discrimination (Employment and",22
NA,Occupation). The Government has failed to,22
NA,honour its obligations under the 1951,22
NA,ILO conventions and recommendations con-,22
NA,cerning equal remuneration for the sexes,22
NA,for work of equal value. It has failed to,22
NA,ratify convention 111 and recommendation,22
NA,11 1 concerning discrimination between the,22
NA,sexes. And it has failed to implement the,22
NA,provisions of the vocational recommenda-,22
NA,tion of 1962 with respect to girls and,22
NA,women. The Government has not ratified,22
NA,convention 100 which provides for equal,22
NA,"pay for equal work for the sexes, and I",22
NA,quote the pertinent part of it:,22
NA,"Each Member shall, by means appropriate to",22
NA,the methods in operation for determining rates,22
NA,"of remuneration, promote and, insofar as is con-",22
NA,"sistent with such methods, ensure the application",22
NA,to all workers of the principle of equal remunera-,22
NA,tion for men and women workers for work of,22
NA,equal value.,22
NA,The Government has done nothing about,22
NA,the ratification of that convention. The ILO,22
NA,"now has 125 members and, of these, 62",22
NA,countries have ratified Convention 100 to,22
NA,which I have referred. Unfortunately Aus-,22
NA,tralia is not one of the 62 countries thai,22
NA,have ratified that convention. Over 56,22
NA,countries have implemented recommenda-,22
NA,tion 90 which states that wage differentials,22
NA,based on sex should be removed pro-,22
NA,gressively and that as the first step the,22
NA,principle of equal pay for work of equal,22
NA,value should be applied in government,22
NA,employment.,22
NA,"Mr Chipp- Mr Speaker, I rise to order.",22
NA,I do not want to be discourteous to the,22
NA,honourable member but he well knows,22
NA,that the question of equal pay is presently,22
NA,before a conciliation commissioner. It has,22
NA,been a long standing practice of this House,22
NA,that such matters as are before a com-,22
NA,missioner are not debated per se in tbis,22
NA,House. I suggest that the honourable,22
NA,member is about to do this.,22
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! There is no,22
NA,substance in the point of order. This matter,22
NA,is before the Commonwealth Conciliation,22
NA,"and Arbitration Commission, not before the",22
NA,Commonwealth Industrial Court.,22
Mr WEBB, I continue. The first para-,22
NA,graph of the recommendation reads as,22
NA,follows:,22
NA,"Appropriate action should be taken, after con-",22
NA,sultation with the workers' organisations con-,22
NA,"cerned or, where such organisations do not exist,",22
NA,with the workers concerned-,22
NA,a. to ensure the application of the principle of,22
NA,equal remuneration for men and women,22
NA,workers for work of equal value to all,22
NA,employees of central Government departments,22
NA,or agencies.,22
NA,That applies to tbe employees of this,22
NA,Government. The recommendation con-,22
NA,tinues:,22
NA,b. to encourage the application of the principle,22
NA,"to employees of State, provincial or local",22
NA,government departments or agencies where,22
NA,these have jurisdiction over rates of,22
NA,remuneration.,22
NA,I have referred to this as a responsibility,22
NA,more of State governments and other bodies,22
NA,concerned with that section of the recom-,22
NA,mendation. State governments have done,22
NA,more to ensure the application of the prin-,22
NA,ciple of equal remuneration than has the,22
NA,Australian Government.,22
NA,The Western Australian State Govern-,22
NA,"ment, for instance, decided in October 1967",22
NA,to give to its female employees equal pay,22
NA,for work of equal value. This great reform,22
NA,will be fully implemented by January 1972.,22
NA,lt has also clarified the powers of the,22
NA,Western Australian Industrial Commission,22
NA,to write the principle into State awards. The,22
NA,decision of the Western Australian Govern-,22
NA,ment means that five out of the six States,22
NA,have granted equal pay and it leaves Vic-,22
NA,toria and the Commonwealth to come into,22
NA,line. It is necessary that there should be,22
NA,national uniformity on the issue of equal,22
NA,pay for equal work. The Minister for,22
NA,Labour and National Service ( Mr Bury),22
NA,has always argued that the Commonwealth,22
NA,Conciliation and Arbitration Commisson,22
NA,"has power to grant equal pay. True enough,",22
NA,but when equal pay was awarded in the,22
NA,malter involving Commonwealth Hostels,22
NA,Limited he appealed against the decision.,22
NA,This is a social reform and the Government,23
NA,should give a lead not only in the indus-,23
NA,trial tribunals but by granting this great,23
NA,social reform to its own employees.,23
NA,It would then fall in line with five of the,23
NA,six States. Government members often lend,23
NA,lip service to this much needed reform.,23
NA,They adopt a two-faced attitude. There is,23
NA,a section of the Liberal Party's platform,23
NA,"which states, as one of its objectives:",23
NA,. . . acceptance of the principle of equal,23
NA,remuneration for men and women for work of,23
NA,equal value.,23
NA,That is as far as it goes. Members opposite,23
NA,talk about it but when it comes to a vote,23
NA,on the implementation of the policy they,23
NA,do nothing about it. The Government has,23
NA,done nothing to give its own employees,23
NA,"equal pay for equal work, ft gives equal",23
NA,"margins, but that is as far as it goes. The",23
NA,regulations under thc Public Service Act,23
NA,discriminate against women officers in the,23
NA,"Public Service. Regulations 104, 105 and",23
NA,"106, under section 30 of the Public Service",23
NA,Act. pinpoint the inequalities that exist,23
NA,between the rates of male and female,23
NA,"workers, many of whom are performing",23
NA,the same type of work and have the same,23
NA,qualifications. Regulation 104 (1.) sets out,23
NA,the salaries payable to officers of the,23
NA,Second and Third Divisions. Paragraphs,23
NA,(2.) and (3.) of the regulation provide that,23
NA,where a female officer occupies an office,23
NA,in the Second or Third Division the rate of,23
NA,salary per annum payable to such female,23
NA,officer shall be $308 less than the male rate to men.,23
NA,for that office. This placing of women in a,23
NA,lower status to men doing the same work,23
NA,is revealed also in regulations 105 and 106.,23
NA,This discrimination should be removed.,23
NA,The Government rejects all claims by,23
NA,white collar unions for equal pay to women,23
NA,employees in the Public Service. It is the,23
NA,"responsibility of this Government, in",23
NA,"accordance with its ILO obligations, to",23
NA,apply the principle of equal pay for work,23
NA,"of equal value to its own employees, but it",23
NA,does not do so. In the Commonwealth,23
NA,Public Service we have men and women,23
NA,"working alongside one another, doing the",23
NA,same work but receiving different rates of,23
NA,pay. Among the countries that have imple-,23
NA,mented recommendation 90 are the United,23
NA,"Kingdom, the United States of America,",23
NA,Canada and New Zealand. These countries,23
NA,have applied to civil servants the principle,23
NA,of equal pay for work of equal value.,23
NA,Britain did so some years ago. New Zealand,23
NA,introduced legislation to provide for equal,23
NA,pay for equal work in 1960. lt was designed,23
NA,to be implemented over a period of 3 years,23
NA,"and, of course, New Zealand's economy is",23
NA,not as sound as Australia's economy. A,23
NA,Labor Government in New Zealand intro-,23
NA,duced this reform and it was not opposed,23
NA,by the Nationalist Opposition at that time.,23
NA,Sixty-two member states of the ILO have,23
NA,ratified Convention 100. Several other States,23
NA,have ratified convention 111 which opposes,23
NA,discrimination against women in employ-,23
NA,ment. Member states have a moral obliga-,23
NA,tion to ratify decisions of ILO. For many,23
NA,centuries a woman suffered social neglect,23
NA,and political inferiority. She now has,23
NA,"equality of civil rights, political rights and",23
NA,educational opportunity. She has equality,23
NA,"of entry to most occupations, yet in Com-",23
NA,monwealth employment in this country she,23
NA,is paid at a lower rate than men doing the,23
NA,"same work. In fact, women have social and",23
NA,political equality but not economic equality.,23
NA,In the interests of social justice a woman,23
NA,should be paid the same rate as a man for,23
NA,doing the same job. Many women workers,23
NA,have dependants to support or to assist.,23
NA,"Women often give help to aged parents,",23
NA,"and divorcees, widows and deserted wives",23
NA,may have children to bring up. Why should,23
NA,a woman school teacher or public servant,23
NA,receive less than her male counterpart? A,23
NA,government that allows this situation to con-,23
NA,tinue is treating women as socially inferior,23
NA,Unequal pay creates a feeling of,23
NA,inferiority and a rankling sense of injustice.,23
NA,Equal pay would remove this. Thi.s is recog-,23
NA,nised by ILO Conventions 100 and 111 and,23
NA,other conventions dealing with the matter,23
NA,of equality between the sexes which have,23
NA,not been ratified by this Government. The,23
NA,members of the so-called weaker sex who,23
NA,"support the Government, whether in this",23
NA,"House or in another place, have not shown",23
NA,much enthusiasm for the principle of equal,23
NA,pay for the sexes for equal work. When an,23
NA,issue has been raised before thi.s House or,23
NA,"in another place, they have not supported",23
NA,the people who have raised it. whether they,23
NA,be on this side of the House or on the other,23
NA,side. They have not the fight of the women,23
NA,of 50 years ago wno showed great courage,23
NA,when they were fighting for another form,23
NA,of equality-th e right to vote. The suff-,23
NA,ragettes chained themselves to the House,23
NA,of Commons railings in those days. Any,24
NA,politician who was not in favour of votes,24
NA,for women was fair game for a lashing-,24
NA,and not just a tongue lashing but a horse,24
NA,whipping.,24
NA,In these days of demonstrations there is,24
NA,plenty of scope for women workers who,24
NA,are treated as inferiors by this Government,24
NA,to demonstrate in support of the great prin-,24
NA,"ciple of equal pay. Sir Winston Churchill,",24
NA,"when he was Home Secretary, was lashed",24
NA,by a suffragette in a Bristol railway station,24
NA,for his opposition to the principle of votes,24
NA,for women. I do not believe in capital,24
NA,"punishment, but I think that women today",24
NA,lack some of the sting that was possessed,24
NA,by the women of the old days. They should,24
NA,go out and fight a government that gives,24
NA,lip service to the principle of equal pay for,24
NA,"equal work, but which fails to adopt the",24
NA,system or to ratify ILO conventions on the,24
NA,subject.,24
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Stewart),24
NA,-Order ! The honourable member's time,24
NA,has expired.,24
Mr BURY ,Wentworth-Minister for,24
NA,Labour and National Service) [3.42]-A s,24
NA,indicated very properly by the honourable,24
NA,"member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp), it is",24
NA,deplorable that matters which are before,24
NA,the Commonwealth Conciliation and Abri-,24
NA,tration Commission should be the subject,24
NA,of detailed debate in this House. I agree,24
NA,with the ruling of Mr Speaker that tech-,24
NA,"nically, since the Act has been changed,",24
NA,"the Commission is not a court, but our fore-",24
NA,bears in this Parliament have always,24
NA,accepted that it is sensible and wise to leave,24
NA,"matters of wages, working hours and condi-",24
NA,tions to be established by the arbitral auth-,24
NA,"orities especially set up for the purpose, and",24
NA,not to debate them on the floor of either,24
NA,the Commonwealth Parliament or the State,24
NA,parliaments. But since this convention has,24
NA,been ignored and the subject of equal pay,24
NA,"has been thrust forward, 1 feel obliged to",24
NA,utter a few words in reply.,24
NA,Il is true that there are International,24
NA,Labor Organisation conventions on this,24
NA,subject. Convention 100 is Ihe basic one on,24
NA,equal remuneration. Convention 111 deals,24
NA,with discrimination. What the honourable,24
NA,member for Stirling ( Mr Webb) did not,24
NA,"say was that other countries, like Australia,",24
NA,have not ratified this Convention because,24
NA,il does present a good many technical dif-,24
NA,ficulties and is somewhat evasive and,24
NA,diffuse. Reading some of the words of these,24
NA,"conventions, the layman does not realise",24
NA,what legal traps there are in them. I want,24
NA,to put the Government's record straight.,24
NA,The point has been made many times that,24
NA,this Government has not been opposed to,24
NA,"equal pay. What we have said consistently,",24
NA,"and what we wiil continue to say, is that",24
NA,the decision on this matter is one that,24
NA,should be made by the Commonwealth,24
NA,"Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,",24
NA,which has the prime function of determin-,24
NA,ing these matters.,24
NA,The equal pay case is presently before,24
NA,the Commission and the Commonwealth,24
NA,has stated its attitude quite clearly. Our,24
NA,counsel in this case has said that it will,24
NA,make clear that the Commonwealth accepls,24
NA,"the principle of equal pay for equal work,",24
NA,"that is, equal pay for women who are doing",24
NA,"the same work as men, or like work, and",24
NA,who are doing the same range and volume,24
NA,of work under the same conditions. So our,24
NA,position is quite clear. When the matter has,24
NA,"come before the Commission, we have",24
NA,stated that we accept the principle. We have,24
NA,noi made decisions ahead of the proper,24
NA,tribunal. The honourable member for,24
NA,Stirling referred in passing to the applica-,24
NA,tion recently lo the Commission by Com-,24
NA,monwealth Hostels Ltd. In such matters,24
NA,Commonwealth Hostels Ltd does not act,24
NA,"under my instructions. It is a company, not",24
NA,a Commonwealth department. It opposed,24
NA,increases in a particular award for a num-,24
NA,ber of technical reasons. I realise that the,24
NA,Opposition has tried to blow this up as a,24
NA,Commonwealth stand on the whole prin-,24
NA,ciple. This is not so. It is a relatively minor,24
NA,and technical case. Our overall position on,24
NA,equal pay has been made clear in the words,24
NA,expressed by our counsel to the Com-,24
NA,mission.,24
NA,The honourable member for Stirling did,24
NA,not mention the fundamental difference,24
NA,"between federal states, particularly indus-",24
NA,"trial federal states, and unitary states, it is",24
NA,a very fundamental difference. When we,24
NA,look at advanced countries whose labour,24
NA,conditions are in fact in most cases fur,24
NA,ahead of those set out in ILO conventions,24
NA,-an d this applies to Australia-th e record,24
NA,looks somewhat different. As the honour-,24
NA,"able member for Stirling mentioned, we",24
NA,have ratified 26 conventions out of 128.,24
NA,"OI course, of these 128 conventions some",25
NA,were quite inapplicable to Australian con-,25
NA,ditions. Some have been replaced by sub-,25
NA,sequent conventions covering the same,25
NA,matters. Canada on tbe whole certainly has,25
NA,working conditions which are in no way,25
NA,"inferior to those in Australia, and that",25
NA,country has ratified twenty-four conven-,25
NA,tions. Canada is a progressive country with,25
NA,"an enlightened government, and in many",25
NA,fields it is ahead of most other countries.,25
NA,Another large federal industrial state is the,25
NA,United States. The United States has,25
NA,"always, or certainly has for many years",25
NA,"past, taken a very close interest in a helpful",25
NA,attitude towards the ILO. The United States,25
NA,has ratified seven conventions. Australia,25
NA,"has ratified twenty-six, so our record com-",25
NA,pares favourably. Of course the United,25
NA,States has more individual States to deal,25
NA,with. But conditions do vary widely between,25
NA,these countries.,25
NA,We are following these conventions conhave been signed.,25
NA,"tinually, and we discuss them with the",25
NA,States where relevant. Each year a number,25
NA,of conventions are discussed by a body,25
NA,up by the Department of Labour and,25
NA,National Service. This body is known as,25
NA,the Department of Labour Advisory inspections,25
NA,"Committee, and it happens to be",25
NA,meeting in Sydney at this moment,25
NA,This year as a special project for the,25
NA,50th anniversary of ILO we are underdrafting,25
NA,taking a review of all ILO conventions and,25
NA,"as soon as this review, which I am presentbeing",25
NA,ing stage by stage to the National Labour,25
NA,"Advisory Council, is complete I will table",25
NA,it in the Parliament. I hope that it will,25
NA,completed later in the year. The fact that,25
NA,a country supports a particular convention,25
NA,during ILO meeting does not mean that that,25
NA,country is necessarily obliged to ratify,25
NA,Many of these conventions when referred,25
NA,to the Australian State authorities are,25
NA,applicable or there is some peculiar diffito,25
NA,culty because of which one State or anwith,25
NA,other cannot adopt them. Perhaps one of,25
NA,the reasons why our numbers lag a little is in.,25
NA,the scrupulous good faith in which we apply,25
NA,all these conventions. Unless we are sure,25
NA,that a convention is applicable throughout,25
NA,Australia-i t takes a lot of time to deal,25
NA,with six governments on every minor,25
NA,which arises-w e do not feel we can ratify,25
NA,it.,25
NA,"Up to 1946, I think, it was accepted in",25
NA,ILO circles and at its meetings that federal,25
NA,countries could ratify these conventions in-,25
NA,sofar as they were applicable to their own,25
NA,federal jurisdiction. This would not be parti-,25
NA,"cularly difficult for Australia in most cases,",25
NA,although it would correspond with reality.,25
NA,But since the revised constitution of 1946,25
NA,when a convention which is appropriate in,25
NA,whole or in part for State action is ratified,25
NA,"by a federal government, the ratification",25
NA,"extends to all the constituent states, pro-",25
NA,"vinces, etc. Therefore it would not",25
NA,now be appropriate for us to try to ratify,25
NA,any convention which was not being fully,25
NA,applied to all State governments. At the,25
NA,back of this motion which seeks ratification,25
NA,of International Labour Organisation con-,25
NA,ventions-whic h we certainly press on with,25
NA,as far as opportunity permits and as early,25
NA,"as practicable-i s a rather theoretical,",25
NA,unreal approach to real problems which lie,25
NA,behind ILO conventions. What matters is,25
NA,"what happens in fact, not what bits of paper",25
NA,Australia's practice is well in advance of,25
NA,set many of these ILO conventions. The ques-,25
NA,tion is: What standards does one apply?,25
NA,It is quite evident from the reports and the,25
NA,that a large number of countries,25
NA,who have subscribed and signed and,25
NA,adhered to conventions apply them in a,25
NA,very simple and inadequate fashion. The,25
NA,of them in many cases is rather,25
NA,"vague, and this leads to loose interpretations",25
NA,applied. Many countries ratify lightly,25
NA,whereas countries such as Australia have,25
NA,been completely scrupulous in keeping every,25
NA,be convention they have signed. The purpose,25
NA,"of these conventions is, firstly, to try to",25
NA,uplift and improve labour conditions in the,25
NA,member countries. In early days in par-,25
NA,it. ticular much stress was placed on inter-,25
NA,national competition and on the view that,25
NA,an industry of one country should not be,25
NA,not handicapped by applying higher standards,25
NA,its work force than in other countries,25
NA,consequent higher costs. It was argued,25
NA,therefore that all countries ought to come,25
NA,"It should be recognised, particularly in",25
NA,"Australia, that in the past the International",25
NA,Labour Organisation has addressed itself,25
NA,point very largely to the requirements of,25
NA,advanced industrial countries. The kind of,25
NA,conventions which might apply in western,25
NA,Europe and which have occupied so much,25
NA,time in thc past in many cases are quite,26
NA,inapplicable to newly developing countries,26
NA,which constitute a large part of ILO mem-,26
NA,bership. We regard ourselves effectively as,26
NA,being part of the Asian group of ILO,26
NA,countries. We meet as part of the Asian,26
NA,group. 1 attended a conference in Japan,26
NA,in September of last year. From our col-,26
NA,leagues in this field we do get the reaction,26
NA,"that ILO is wrapped up in the conventions,",26
NA,which apply to western Europe and does,26
NA,not pay sufficient attention to the actual,26
NA,practical uplift and improvement in working,26
NA,conditions which is needed in this area.,26
NA,We now have an Asian manpower plan,26
NA,"for Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. It",26
NA,much more important for these countries,26
NA,to get practical aid in improving conditions,26
NA,than it is to concentrate on ILO conventions,26
NA,which are often designed just for western,26
NA,Europe. Recently I visited Kuala Lumpur,26
NA,"at the invitation of Mr Manickauasagan,",26
NA,"the Minister for Labour in Malaysia, and",26
NA,also Singapore. The aid which wc are,26
NA,this area receives good support from both,26
NA,the trade unions and the employer groups.,26
NA,This is the part of the world in which,26
NA,live and we should concentrate very heavily,26
NA,in ILO in protecting their interests,26
Mr HAYDEN ,Oxley) [3.58]-Th e con-,26
NA,ventions of the International Labour,26
NA,Organisation feature a number of relatively,26
NA,moderate recommendations concerned with,26
NA,the material and also the spiritual welfare,26
NA,of nations and their people. When 1 speak,26
NA,"about spiritual welfare, I do not speak in",26
NA,the narrow theological sense but rather in,26
NA,the very broad sense of the quality of life,26
NA,and values which people accept and are,26
NA,encouraged to develop. They are very,26
NA,important recommendations. I stress that,26
NA,they are quite moderate recommendations.,26
NA,"Having studied the recommendations, there",26
NA,is nothing extremely radical about them and,26
NA,certainly nothing which would be inappro-,26
NA,priate to the Australian community. I hope,26
NA,to indicate witb a few pointers that the,26
NA,recommendations are quite appropriate to,26
NA,Australia's needs. Therefore I am some-,26
NA,what surprised at the attitude of the Minis-,26
NA,ter for Labour and Industry ( Mr Bury).,26
NA,There are two things I want to speak Minister for Labour and National Service,26
NA,about in relation to the Minister's speech-,26
NA,two pretexts which he put forward as,26
NA,reasons for the Government not involving,26
NA,itself in a greater number of ratifications of,26
NA,"JLO conventions. Firstly, he said we are",26
NA,"in the Asian area and he spoke about poor,",26
NA,"humble, underdeveloped little Australia.",26
NA,This is the implication of what he says in,26
NA,"relation to conferences, discussions, and so",26
NA,on of the ILO. Then he spoke about the,26
NA,huge developed industrial societies which,26
NA,bulk large and overshadow os. With the,26
NA,greatest respect for the Minister- I do have,26
NA,a great deal of respect for him personally,26
NA,"- I think that the views, political ones on",26
NA,"this occasion, which he has put in this",26
NA,House are a lot of humbug. They remind,26
NA,me of the occasion a couple of years ago,26
NA,when the Minister for Trade and Industry,26
NA,is ( Mr MCEwen) went to Geneva to speak on,26
NA,behalf of Australia and represented Aus-,26
NA,"tralia as a struggling, backward, under-",26
NA,"developed country. Petty, in one ol"" his",26
NA,"pungent, satirical cartoons, defined the",26
NA,Minister as receiving the award lor,26
NA,the actor of the year. Surely this year we,26
NA,could give the award for the actor of the,26
NA,giving year to the Minisler for Labour and,26
NA,National Service for trying to picture our,26
NA,problems in handling ILO conventions as,26
NA,we being related to our backwardness as a,26
NA,member of the overall backward Asian,26
NA,and ours. bloc of countries.,26
NA,1 come now to the passing of the buck,26
NA,syndrome-th e Commonwealth and State,26
NA,financial relations. He spoke about this at,26
NA,some length in relation to the problem of,26
NA,equal pay for women in the work force.,26
NA,What he ought to appreciate is that very,26
NA,largely the problems of the States in,26
NA,financing their various ventures arise from,26
NA,the fact that increasingly they are being,26
NA,forced to amass a greater debt while at the,26
NA,same time the Commonwealth is writing off,26
NA,its debt. So per capita the indebtedness of,26
NA,people under State administration is rapidly,26
NA,enlarging whilst at the Commonwealth level,26
NA,it is decreasing and before long may be,26
NA,eliminated. The Commonwealth is the,26
NA,organ which has the authority to regulate,26
NA,debt. It is a clever but unconvincing pretext,26
NA,that he has put forward to us.,26
NA,Only 26 of the 128 conventions of the,26
NA,ILO have been ratified by Australia. The,26
NA,1,26
NA,compared this with the performance of,26
NA,countries with advanced economies. There,26
NA,is a contradiction here. Towards the latter,26
NA,part of bis speech he spoke about Aus-,27
NA,tralia's problems as a member of the under-,27
NA,"developed Asian bloc, but earlier he talked",27
NA,about Australia as compared with countries,27
NA,"with advanced economies, with which he",27
NA,identified Australia. But let us neglect this,27
NA,unhappy contradiction. Comparing Aus-,27
NA,tralia with other countries with advanced,27
NA,economies he said that the record was not,27
NA,a bad one. Let us look at the record more,27
NA,appropriate to his Government's term of,27
NA,office. Only two conventions have been,27
NA,ratified since his Government came into,27
NA,office in 1949-Conventio n No. 105. relat-,27
NA,"ing to the abolition of forced labour, and",27
NA,"Convention No. 116, relating to the revision",27
NA,of final articles. These were ratified in 1957,27
NA,and 1961 respectively. We have been a,27
NA,member of the Organisation since 1919 yet,27
NA,there have been two ratifications in the,27
NA,period of nearly 20 years during which this,27
NA,Government bas been in office. I hope that,27
NA,he is not satisfied.,27
NA,I want to speak about Convention No.,27
NA,"107, which is an extremely appropriate",27
NA,convention for Australians to have been,27
NA,concerned to ratify a long time ago. It,27
NA,relates to tribal and semi-tribal populations,27
NA,and thc need to promote continued action,27
NA,to improve the living and working condi-,27
NA,tions of these people by various forms of,27
NA,action. The appropriateness of this is quite,27
NA,current. Part If of this Convention relates,27
NA,to land rights and Article 11 states:,27
NA,"The right of ownership, collective or individual,",27
NA,of the members of the populations concerned,27
NA,the lands which these populations traditionally,27
NA,occupy shall be recognised.,27
NA,Article 13 states:,27
NA,Procedures for the transmission of rights,27
NA,ownership and use of land which are established,27
NA,by the customs of the population concerned,27
NA,be respected. . . .,27
NA,This is a vitally important convention for,27
NA,"Australia. Australians must feel embarrassed,",27
NA,"first of all, to find that only 26 out of",27
NA,100-odd conventions bave been ratified by,27
NA,Australia. They must be more embarrassed,27
NA,to find that in the period of nearly 20 years,27
NA,during which this Government has been in,27
NA,office only 2 have been ratified. They must,27
NA,feci quite humble to discover that amongst,27
NA,those which bave not been ratified is this,27
NA,convention relating to the protection and,27
NA,integration of indigenous and other tribal,27
NA,and semi-tribal populations in independent,27
NA,countries. Al tbe present time the Yirrkala,27
NA,Aboriginals at Gove are expressing their,27
NA,concern-the y have taken the issue to court,27
NA,-a t the way in which the Federal Govern-,27
NA,ment has aided and abetted an outside,27
NA,organisation- a private enterprise organisa-,27
NA,tion which has gone roughshod into their,27
NA,sacred tribal lands and exploited these lands,27
NA,for private profit.,27
NA,The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr,27
NA,Wentworth) put the rights of the Aboriginal,27
NA,people very clearly in this House a few,27
NA,weeks ago when he said that we as a Euro-,27
NA,pean advanced society would be appalled,27
NA,if someone said that a Catholic priest had,27
NA,to disclose Ihe details of a confession or,27
NA,that a Mason had to disclose details of,27
NA,the private procedures at a Masonic meet-,27
NA,"ing, yet we feel no revulsion and no alarm",27
NA,when a private organisation is able to move,27
NA,into traditional Aboriginal grounds and,27
NA,desecrate those grounds. Clearly there has,27
NA,been a complete disregard for tbe rights,27
NA,of these people and it is in conflict with,27
NA,the undertakings which we would have had,27
NA,to accept if we had ratified Convention,27
NA,No. 107. So it becomes obvious that we,27
NA,have not ratified Convention No. 107 not,27
NA,"because, as tbe Minister suggests, there are",27
NA,problems in obtaining the agreement of the,27
NA,various State governments throughout the,27
NA,Commonwealth but because his Govern-,27
NA,ment is one of the main offenders against,27
NA,the rights of tribal and semi-tribal people,27
NA,in the Australian community. I am certainly,27
NA,not expunging any criticism or guilt of the,27
NA,over State governments. They are certainly,27
NA,responsible for a great deal of this kind,27
NA,of treatment of these people. But the,27
NA,Federal Government itself has to establish,27
NA,of standards here and has not done so. This,27
NA,is the main reason why the Government,27
NA,shall has not ratified Convention No. 107.,27
NA,"Convention No. 100, with which the",27
NA,"honourable member for Stirling dealt, relates",27
NA,to equal remuneration for female workers.,27
NA,Surely it is a society based on discrimina-,27
NA,tion which allows a discrimination to exist,27
NA,"against women in their pay rates, merely",27
NA,"because they are women. Frankly, my feel-",27
NA,ing on the equal remuneration case is that,27
NA,whether or not women are doing the same,27
NA,"work as men, the fact is that they are in",27
NA,the work force and are entitled to the same,27
NA,level of wages as males are receiving. I see,27
NA,no problem in providing them witb these,27
NA,wages. If in fact there would be immediate,27
NA,economic problems in providing the whole,28
NA,"bulk of these wages in one movement, why",28
NA,not stagger it over 2 or 3 years? A case,28
NA,against this has yet to be established and,28
NA,"I am yet to be convinced. Finally, I am",28
NA,"concerned in any event as to whether, if",28
NA,"we had signed or ratified this Convention,",28
NA,"we would have fulfilled our obligations,",28
NA,because in Article 23 (2) of the Universal,28
NA,Declaration of Human Rights of the United,28
NA,Nations we ourselves have to provide equal,28
NA,"pay for females in the work force. In fact,",28
NA,"we have never fulfilled this obligation, yet",28
NA,wc voted in support of this recommenda-,28
NA,tion. Under the International Covenant on,28
NA,"Economic, Social and Cultural Rights there",28
NA,is a clear obligation in Article II of Fart 1,28
NA,to eliminate poverty in our community and,28
NA,we have not done this at the present time.,28
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,28
NA,honourable member's time has expired.,28
Mr HUGHES ,Parkes) [4.8]- I have,28
NA,listened with interest to the contributions,28
NA,so far made in this debate by the two,28
NA,"Opposition speakers, the honourable mem-",28
NA,ber for Stirling ( Mr Webb) and the honour-,28
NA,able member for Oxley ( Mr Hayden). The,28
NA,impression with which I am left is that the,28
NA,attack which the Opposition has sought to,28
NA,mount against the Government is based,28
NA,firstly-here I refer particularly to the,28
NA,honourable member for Stirling-o n,28
NA,selective and therefore misleading quotation,28
NA,of statistics. The second impression that 1,28
NA,have is that the Opposition just failed to,28
NA,understand the basic problem involved in,28
NA,ratifying International Labour Organisation,28
NA,"conventions, particularly in the case of a",28
NA,country with a federal system of govern-,28
NA,ment. First let me deal with the selective,28
NA,quotation of random statistics by the,28
NA,honourable member for Stirling. He sought,28
NA,"to suggest, by reference to the record in",28
NA,"relation to ratifications by other countries,",28
NA,which are countries with unitary systems,28
NA,of government and not federal systems of,28
NA,"government, that Australia has been a",28
NA,laggard.,28
NA,The matter was placed in its correct,28
NA,perspective by the Minister for Labour and,28
NA,"National Service ( Mr Bury), because he",28
NA,"pointed out that Australia's record, by com-",28
NA,parison with other countries with a federal,28
NA,"and not a unitary system of government, is",28
NA,one with which Australia can well a/ford to,28
NA,be satisfied. We have ratified 26 of the ILO,28
NA,"conventions.. Canada has ratified 24, and",28
NA,the United States has ratified 7. So it is,28
NA,hardly to the point for my honourable,28
NA,friend from Stirling to make some criticism,28
NA,of Australia's performance by reference,28
NA,solely to the record in relation to ratifica-,28
NA,tions by such countries as be mentioned.,28
NA,"One of these was Italy which, as we all",28
NA,"know, has a unitary system of government.",28
NA,Let me come next to the other point I,28
NA,mentioned by way of criticism of the Oppo-,28
NA,"sition's attack, if one can call it an attack.",28
NA,The Opposition's approach reflects a b;;sic,28
NA,failure to understand the essential problems,28
NA,involved in the ratification by a federal,28
NA,government of ILO conventions. J can make,28
NA,the point by reference to the very mailer,28
NA,which was argued by tbe honourable mem-,28
NA,ber for Oxley in relation to Convention 107,28
NA,which deals with land rights and other rights,28
NA,in relation to tribal and semi-tribal people.,28
NA,I would venture a passing criticism of the,28
NA,honourable member for Oxley's contribu-,28
NA,tion to this debate. He referred to tbe Gove,28
NA,dispute in which we all know there is a,28
NA,genuine legal problem as to the rights of the,28
NA,Aboriginals at Gove in relation to land said,28
NA,to be tribal land. He referred to that dispute.,28
Mr BRYANT ,"l t is not a legal problem, it",28
NA,is a problem of ethics.,28
Mr HUGHES,Th e honourable mem-,28
NA,ber for Wills is always interrupting stud,28
NA,always blowing forth a lot of air but never,28
NA,"saying very much, and be is running true",28
NA,to form this afternoon. T am trying to make,28
NA,a serious contribution to this debate and the,28
NA,honourable gentleman might listen to me in,28
NA,silence for once. The honourable member,28
NA,for Oxley referred to this question of the,28
NA,rights in respect of lands at Gove as though,28
NA,the matter was already concluded in favour,28
NA,of the tribal Aboriginals there. The point,28
NA,I want to make is that the dispute is dis-,28
NA,tinctly sub judice. The case is presently,28
NA,pending in the Supreme Court of the,28
NA,Northern Territory and it is therefore not,28
NA,a fit subject to raise at this stage on the floor,28
NA,of the House. But be that as it may. The,28
NA,honourable member in his argument has,28
NA,glossed over a basicflaw.He must know-o r,28
NA,if he does not know he ought to know and,28
NA,perhaps I can enlighten him if he needs,28
NA,enlightening or will take enlightenment-,28
NA,that questions of laws relating to land,28
NA,tenure are essentially matters within Stale,28
NA,"jurisdiction except, of course, in Common-",28
NA,wealth territories.,28
NA,What is the position-an d this I would,29
NA,ask the honourable member for Oxley to,29
NA,think about-i n the case of the Federal Go-,29
NA,vernment? Is the Government lo ratify a,29
NA,convention just because it is prepared to,29
NA,apply a convention so far as application,29
NA,depends upon federal jurisdiction and,29
NA,implementation upon federal laws? Or,29
NA,should the Government- I suggest it should,29
NA,-tak e inio account the fact that it would,29
NA,be quite improper for it as a federal go-,29
NA,"vernment, lo ratify a convention unless the",29
NA,State jurisdictions were exercised in the,29
NA,same way as the Federal Government pro-,29
NA,posed to exercise federal jurisdictions in,29
NA,relation to the implementation of the con-,29
NA,vention? It would be a gross breach of faith,29
NA,for a federal government such as the Aus-,29
NA,tralian Government to ratify a convention,29
NA,relating to land tenures unless it were cer-,29
NA,tain in advance of ratification that State,29
NA,governments would come into line. It is idle,29
NA,for anyone on the Opposition side of this,29
NA,House to suggest that the ground has been,29
NA,laid or may be laid for Commonwealth Go-,29
NA,vernment ratification of Convention 107,29
NA,because the necessary foundation for rati-,29
NA,fication is lacking inasmuch as State governhas,29
NA,"ments have not agreed and, for all 1 know,",29
NA,show no signs of agreeing to render tbeir,29
NA,laws uniform to the point at which it could,29
NA,be said that the Commonwealth Govern-,29
NA,ment could bona fide ratify this convention,29
NA,or treaty.,29
NA,That is why 1 say that the Opposition's,29
NA,criticism is based upon a fundamental mis-,29
NA,conception of the whole nature of the,29
NA,problem. It is very easy to make a super-,29
NA,ficial attack upon the Government based,29
NA,upon what is really a selective misquotation,29
NA,of the relevent statistics and to gloss over,29
NA,the underlying problem. Let me inform the,29
NA,House that prior to 1946 a government,29
NA,such as the Commonwealth Government-,29
NA,a federal government-coul d ratify an ILO,29
NA,convention while limiting its ratification,29
NA,"federal jurisdiction. In 1946, as the Leader",29
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) will well,29
NA,"know, the constitution of the International",29
NA,Labour Organisation was amended so as to,29
NA,provide in substance that any federal,29
NA,"government, if it ratified a convention,",29
NA,would be taken to do so in an overall sense,29
NA,so that the ratification would extend to,29
NA,matters lying within State jurisdiction. In,29
NA,that state of affairs- I mention this for the,29
NA,purpose of emphasis-i t would be not only,29
NA,idle but also bad faith for the Federal,29
NA,"Government at this stage, in the absence of",29
NA,agreement by all the State governments on,29
NA,"any particular topic, to ratify conventions.",29
NA,"If, as 1 hope it will, this becomes under-",29
NA,stood by the members of the Opposition,29
NA,the weakness of the arguments they have,29
NA,sought to propound this afternoon will,29
NA,become apparent to any of them with any,29
NA,common sense.,29
NA,There is another point which should not,29
NA,go unnoticed. If Australia ratines a parti-,29
NA,cular convention we undertake and bind,29
NA,"ourselves in advance, according to the",29
NA,charter or constitution of the International,29
NA,"Labour Organisation, to be bound not by",29
NA,our interpretation of what the convention,29
NA,means and our interpretation of the obliga-,29
NA,tions which it expresses or implies but by,29
NA,the interpretation not of our own Govern-,29
NA,meni legal adviser but of a committee of,29
NA,experts set. up to interpret the text of the,29
NA,convention. This is in itself a very sound,29
NA,reason for adopting a cautious approach to,29
NA,the ratification of these conventions. No,29
NA,Opposition supporter so far this afternoon,29
NA,mentioned the fact that in the United,29
NA,"Kingdom where, as we all know, there is",29
NA,a Labour government-perhap s for not,29
NA,very much longer-whic h has announced,29
NA,categorically that it will not ratify Conven-,29
NA,tion 100 on equal pay for women.,29
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The,29
NA,honourable member's time has expired.,29
Mr WHITLAM ,Werriwa-Leader of,29
NA,the Opposition) [4.18]-Th e Opposition has,29
NA,brought up for discussion the Government's,29
NA,disappointing record on the ratification and,29
NA,application ol International Labor Organi-,29
NA,sation conventions. It is quite clear that,29
NA,Government supporters from the Minisler,29
NA,down are seeking to justify that record. Let,29
NA,me reiterate the facts. The ILO Conference,29
NA,"has adopted 128 conventions. Of these, 26",29
NA,to have been ratified by Australia. Nineteen,29
NA,of those ratified were adopted at pre-war,29
NA,ILO Conferences. There have been 61 con-,29
NA,ventions adopted since the war and 7 have,29
NA,been ratified by Australia. There have been,29
NA,30 conventions adopted during the 1950s,29
NA,"and 1960s, that is, in the time of Australia's",29
NA,Federal Liberal Government. Of those 30,29
NA,conventions 18 have been supported at the,29
NA,Conference by the Australian Government,29
NA,representatives and 2 have been ratified by,29
NA,Australia.,29
NA,"This month, as my colleague the honour-",30
NA,able member for Stirling ( Mr Webb),30
NA,"pointed out, is the 50th anniversary of the",30
NA,"ILO. Our record, which is bad and getting",30
NA,"worse, shows that the present Australian",30
NA,Government has little regard for the organi-,30
NA,sation of which Australia was a foundation,30
NA,member. We have troubles as a federal,30
NA,"state, like Canada, whose record is slightly",30
NA,"inferior to ours, but at least Canada has",30
NA,had a spate of ratifications in the last few,30
NA,years under the Pearson Government.,30
NA,If we compare ourselves with all of our,30
NA,"trading partners, particularly those in",30
NA,"Europe, we find that their record is",30
NA,immeasurably better.,30
NA,The greatest attention in today's,30
NA,debate has been directed to the Equal,30
NA,Remuneration Convention of 1951. It was,30
NA,a convention upon which Australian,30
NA,Government representatives abstained from,30
NA,voting. They nevertheless supported the,30
NA,recommendation. Under the recommenda-,30
NA,tion the Government has an obligation to,30
NA,ensure the application of the principle of,30
NA,equal remuneration for men and women,30
NA,workers for work of equal value in all,30
NA,central government departments and agen-,30
NA,"cies, to encourage the application of the",30
NA,"principle to employees of State, provincial",30
NA,or local authorities or agencies and to ensure,30
NA,the application of the principle as regards,30
NA,industries and services where such rates are,30
NA,"determined under public authority, indus-",30
NA,tries and undertakings operated under public,30
NA,"ownership or control and, where approp-",30
NA,"riate, work executed under the terms of",30
NA,public contracts. It is quite clear that under,30
NA,"the recommendation, which the Australian",30
NA,"Government supports, we have had, since",30
NA,"1951, the obligation to provide equal pay",30
NA,"in the Commonwealth Public Service, in",30
NA,Commonwealth instrumentalities and under,30
NA,Commonwealth contracts. We have not,30
NA,done so. We cannot hide behind the Com-,30
NA,monwealth Conciliation and Arbitration,30
NA,Commission in these matters. As a nation,30
NA,we have an obligation to apply this prin-,30
NA,ciple in these Commonwealth fields of,30
NA,responsibility.,30
NA,In the federal public services in the,30
NA,United States and Canada and in the unitary,30
NA,public services of Britain and New Zealand,30
NA,equal pay has long since applied. While,30
NA,Canada and the United States have not,30
NA,ratified the Equal Remuneration Convention,30
NA,at least 70% or 80% of their total popula-,30
NA,tion enjoys equal pay because the principal,30
NA,industrial states of tbe United States and,30
NA,provinces of Canada have legislated for the,30
NA,principle. There were interjections earlier,30
NA,about the position of the only Labor,30
NA,"Government in Australia, that in Tasmania.",30
NA,As tbe Premier of Tasmania pointed out,30
NA,"in his policy speech last night, efforts to",30
NA,provide legislation for equal pay linger,30
NA,industrial awards had been thrown out by,30
NA,"the Legislative Council, which limited equal",30
NA,pay to State government employees. So,30
NA,much for equal pay.,30
NA,There is a field in which the Common-,30
NA,"wealth clearly has sole authority, namely",30
NA,"our overseas territories, particularly the",30
NA,Territory of Papua and New Guinea.,30
NA,There are ten conventions which are directly,30
NA,applicable to that Territory. We abstained,30
NA,from voting on two of them; we have,30
NA,applied none of them. To its non-metro-,30
NA,"politan territories in the Pacific, Great",30
NA,"Britain has applied six of them, New",30
NA,Zealand six and France two. No arbitration,30
NA,commission is required here. All that we,30
NA,bave to do is honour the obligations which,30
NA,we have assumed under the body of which,30
NA,we were a founding member 50 years ago.,30
NA,"Again, the Commonwealth has the principal",30
NA,"responsibility as regards Aboriginals, the",30
NA,greatest number of whom live in the,30
NA,Northern Territory. It did not require the,30
NA,1967 referendum to give the Common-,30
NA,wealth authority to apply in the Northern,30
NA,Territory International Labour Organisation,30
NA,conventions-th e Indigenous and Tribal,30
NA,Populations Convention of 1957 and the,30
NA,Discrimination (Employment and Occupa-,30
NA,tion) Convention of 1958. We did not do,30
NA,so. We are in fact pursuing the policy which,30
NA,we followed in those years at the ILO,30
NA,conferences where we abstained from voting,30
NA,"on both of those conventions. Finally, the",30
NA,Commonwealth has the overwhelming,30
NA,responsibility in navigation. Nearly all Aus-,30
NA,tralian shipping is interstate or overseas;,30
NA,very little is intrastate. As regards interstate,30
NA,"and overseas and territorial shipping, Aus-",30
NA,tralia has complete power to apply ILO,30
NA,maritime conventions. We have not done,30
NA,"so. In fact, we have had tbe ludicrous",30
NA,spectacle of legislation amending the Navi-,30
NA,gation Act to permit compliance later being,30
NA,repealed before we had in fact ratified the,30
NA,conventions concerned.,30
NA,"As regards equal pay, overseas territories,",31
NA,"Aboriginals in the Northern Territory,",31
NA,navigation between the States and to other,31
NA,countries: In every case we have failed to,31
NA,carry out our international obligations. In,31
NA,"addition, under the 1946 amendments to the",31
NA,ILO constitution the Australian Government,31
NA,has an obligation to arrange for periodical,31
NA,"consultations between Federal and State,",31
NA,"provincial or cantonal, authorities with a",31
NA,view to promoting within the Federal State,31
NA,co-ordinated action to give effect to the,31
NA,provisions of such conventions and recom-,31
NA,mendations. These efforts take place at a,31
NA,low level-th e annual conference in April,31
NA,"of Departments of Labour, between officials",31
NA,who have proved notably ineffective in,31
NA,persuading their ministerial masters or who,31
NA,have not been apprised sufficiently of our,31
NA,international obligations. International con-,31
NA,ferences may be attended by persons nomin-,31
NA,ated by tbe Commonwealth alone. The,31
NA,States have no international standing what-,31
NA,ever. As a matter of practice the Common-,31
NA,"wealth has, since the post-war Federal",31
NA,"Labor Government, nominated a represen-",31
NA,tative of tbe State governments to the,31
NA,annual ILO conferences. We have the,31
NA,ludicrous situation where the States obstruct,31
NA,the Commonwealth in carrying out obliga-,31
NA,tions undertaken at conferences where they,31
NA,have no standing. We make our federal,31
NA,system a farce where we undertake obliga-,31
NA,tions which we. then allow our constituent,31
NA,States to frustrate. Our obligation since,31
NA,1946 has been to arrange for periodical,31
NA,consultations. Answers to questions which,31
NA,I regularly ask about ILO conventions,31
NA,illustrate that there has been scant effort by,31
NA,the Commonwealth to secure State col-,31
NA,laboration even on those matters where the,31
NA,Commonwealth itself has the greatest obliga-,31
NA,"tion, as in navigation, Aboriginals and equal",31
NA,pay. If it were not for debates of the kind,31
NA,we have initiated today this subject would,31
NA,never be debated in the Parliament. State-,31
NA,ments which Ministers make to the Parlia-,31
NA,ment are never debated. I can find no,31
NA,record of any debate in Parliament on state-,31
NA,ments about annua] ILO conferences.,31
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order ! The ment,31
NA,honourable member's time has expired.,31
Mr HALLEIT ,Canning) [4.28]-I,31
NA,raising this matter today the Opposition,31
NA,referred to what it describes as the Governdebating,31
NA,ment's disappointing record in the ratifica-,31
NA,tion and application of International Labour,31
NA,Organisation conventions. The honourable,31
NA,member for Parkes ( Mr Hughes) dealt in,31
NA,"some length with the difficulties, mainly of a",31
NA,"machinery nature, in ratifying many of",31
NA,these conventions. These difficulties are well,31
NA,known. We have our difliculties even in,31
NA,ratifying agreements between management,31
NA,and labour in this country. When you get,31
NA,into the international field obviously the,31
NA,difficulties will be multiplied many times,31
NA,over.,31
NA,In claiming that the Government has a,31
NA,disappointing record in these matters it is,31
NA,obvious that the Opposition is referring to,31
NA,the principle of equal pay. This is the crux,31
NA,of the whole business. The honourable,31
NA,"member for Stirling ( Mr Webb) said, if I",31
NA,"remember his remarks correctly, that the",31
NA,Government had failed to promote the con-,31
NA,cept of equal pay. It is on this claim that,31
NA,the Opposition bases its submission that,31
NA,the Government's record is disappointing.,31
NA,"If we combine these two particular issues,",31
NA,what is the responsibility of a government,31
NA,to bring about a position of equal pay for,31
NA,the sexes in Australia? It must be well,31
NA,known that what we would have to do in,31
NA,"this country, or in any other country, is",31
NA,to create a climate whereby the principle,31
NA,"of equal pay could be introduced, if this",31
NA,is lhe requirement.,31
NA,"The Government's responsibility, as I",31
NA,"see it, is twofold. Firstly, it has to set up",31
NA,certain machinery to deal with this matter.,31
NA,In this case the machinery would be the,31
NA,Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitra-,31
NA,tion Commission. This has been in,31
NA,existence for many years. Any disputes,31
NA,regarding wages have been dealt with by,31
NA,a commission or body set up for the,31
NA,particular case. This is the Australian,31
NA,"policy. Secondly, as 1 see it, it is the Aus-",31
NA,tralian Government's responsibility to make,31
NA,certain things possible. It surprises me that,31
NA,this matter has been brought forward at,31
NA,"this time. If, in fact, we did not have at",31
NA,this particular time a registered unemploy-,31
NA,"figure of a little over 1%, I would",31
NA,suggest that we would not be debating this,31
NA,"particular matter today. If, for instance,",31
NA,n there were an unemployment figure of,31
NA,has 3% or 4% we certainly would not be,31
NA,it today. We are debating this,31
NA,matter because conditions have been estab-,32
NA,lished in Australia in which we are still,32
NA,"very short of labour, notwithstanding the",32
NA,rapid influx of newcomers to this country,32
NA,under our migration programme. Australia,32
NA,is in fact in dire need of more labour.,32
NA,Therefore an atmosphere has been estab-,32
NA,lished in wbich we can perhaps discuss,32
NA,these matters.,32
NA,I come to the question of whether the,32
NA,Government is opposed to this particular,32
NA,principle of equal pay for the sexes. It is,32
NA,certainly not opposed to the principle. The,32
NA,Government has made it perfectly clear that,32
NA,it is not opposed to the principle of equal,32
NA,pay for equal work. So having created the,32
NA,position in wbicb we can employ more,32
NA,"people than are available at the moment, I",32
NA,suggest that we are putting ourselves in thc,32
NA,situation in which we can support such a,32
NA,"measure in a practical way, not merely in",32
NA,words or on pieces of paper. They would be,32
NA,empty words or empty paper if we were to,32
NA,advocate a principle but were not in a,32
NA,position to do anthing practical about it.,32
NA,This would be the case if the economy were,32
NA,not sound and if the state of the labour,32
NA,force was not sucb that we could not absorb,32
NA,extra labour. But that is not the case in,32
NA,Australia. 1 think that one of our greatest,32
NA,problems today is that we want more skilled,32
NA,labour in Australia. One of our greatest,32
NA,inflationary pressures at the present time,32
NA,results from the fact that we do not have,32
NA,sufficient labour to carry out the develop-,32
NA,ment work thai is confronting us.,32
NA,So the first obligation of the Government,32
NA,is to create a healthy climate in which these,32
NA,"things can be done. If this is not done, then",32
NA,it is empty words to suggest that the,32
NA,Government recommends that they should,32
NA,be done. The Government does not oppose,32
NA,the principle of equal pay for the sexes and,32
NA,"has not opposed it in the United Nations,",32
NA,which is perhaps the highest authority in,32
NA,the world in which these matters can be,32
NA,debated. The Government has agreed to,32
NA,resolutions on this question which have been,32
NA,"moved at the United Nations, lt did not vote",32
NA,"for them, but tbat is only a technical point.",32
NA,It has agreed to the principle not only in,32
NA,Australia but also in the wider field of the,32
NA,United Nations. It is clear to me that it is,32
NA,not a matter on which we should make any,32
NA,decisions in this House. It should be left to,32
NA,13861/69-«-143 ],32
NA,the appropriate authority. Could you,32
NA,imagine anything worse than the govern-,32
NA,ment of the day making decisions in its own,32
NA,right in relation to wbat wages or salaries,32
NA,should be paid within the nation? What a,32
NA,chaotic situation that would create. That is,32
NA,why I said when I first rose to speak that,32
NA,I was a little surprised that this matter,32
NA,should be debated at this particular time.,32
NA,Perhaps we do not always agree with,32
NA,the decisions which are made in some,32
NA,"cases, but J believe that the correct policy",32
NA,is lo have a tribunal to sort out the,32
NA,particular issues. That is the only fair and,32
NA,just way in which a case can be debated,32
NA,and in which each side of an argument,32
NA,can be put in an unbiased way before an,32
NA,independent commission. It is not for,32
NA,governments and it is not for parliaments,32
NA,"to deal with these matters, other than to",32
NA,set up the machinery. 1 repeat again that,32
NA,in this atmosphere and with the machinery,32
NA,"we have in Australia, the first responsi-",32
NA,bility of the Government is to maintain a,32
NA,stable economy and to attract to this,32
NA,country the right sort of industries which,32
NA,can in fact employ labour-no t only men,32
NA,"but women. As we know, many women",32
NA,are in employment in Australia. The,32
NA,Governinent has a responsibility to main-,32
NA,"tain employment, and this has been done.",32
NA,In my own State the registered unemploy-,32
NA,ment figure was approximately .7% or,32
NA,.8% for a long time. It is slightly higher,32
NA,"than that at the present time, but it is fall-",32
NA,"ing again. In my book, it is too high and",32
NA,it results in inflationary pressure. The,32
NA,Government has a responsibility to ensure,32
NA,that a balance is maintained. It is not for,32
NA,a government to sort out differences of,32
NA,opinion between employers and employees.,32
NA,The government simply has to set up the,32
NA,necessary machinery. As thc honourable,32
NA,member for Parkes ( Mr Hughes) pointed,32
NA,"out, there are six State governments also",32
NA,to be consulted regarding the ratification,32
NA,of the particular conventions of which we,32
NA,have been speaking this afternoon. The,32
NA,procedure is even more complex in Aus-,32
NA,tralia than it is in many other countries.,32
NA,It is not an easy matter to sort out all thc,32
NA,problems associated with international,32
NA,conventions. It is difficult enough to sort,32
NA,out the many complications in Australia.,32
NA,I suggest that the Government has carried,32
NA,out its responsibilities in establishing tbe,32
NA,climate whereby this principle of equal pay,33
NA,for equal work can be introduced. The,33
NA,technical details can be overcome.,33
Mr BRYANT ,WUls) [4.37]-Di d 1 hear,33
NA,the honourable member for Canning ( Mr,33
NA,Hallett) aright when I heard bim suggest,33
NA,that we are at a stage of over full employ-,33
NA,ment?,33
NA,NA,33
Mr BRYANT,"I n fact, unemployment is",33
NA,part and parcel of his philosophy. He does,33
NA,not look like that kind of a person. The,33
NA,matter seems to be quite foreign to what we,33
NA,are debating this afternoon and to the,33
NA,general principles of the International,33
NA,"Labour Organisation. Of course, we know",33
NA,that honourable members opposite do not,33
NA,care a darn when people are out of work.,33
NA,They are more concerned with inflation,33
NA,than they are with people. It is time that,33
NA,they started to apply themselves to the,33
NA,human problem which is before the House,33
NA,this afternoon. We have listened to a suc-,33
NA,"cession of speakers, including apologists",33
NA,"for inaction, inequality, inability and insin-",33
NA,cerity who are capable of any slide of lan-,33
NA,guage or of logic rather than looking at the,33
NA,subject fairly and squarely. Today we are,33
NA,discussing Australia's attitude to conven-,33
NA,tions in accordance with its membership of,33
NA,"the International Labour Organisation, of",33
NA,which we were a foundation member and,33
NA,of which we have been a continuing mem-,33
NA,ber. In some ways it is an admirable orga-,33
NA,"nisation, as far as its structure is concerned.",33
NA,Governments send to the organisation dele-,33
NA,"gates from employers, employees and go-",33
NA,"vernment sources, all, I understand, with",33
NA,the right to vote as they think fit when,33
NA,they get there. It is an estimable organisa-,33
NA,tion in that regard.,33
NA,It has been disappointing that honourable,33
NA,members opposite do not face up to the,33
NA,question of where our responsibilities really,33
NA,lie. We have heard so much this afternoon,33
NA,about how difficult it is to do things. The,33
NA,honourable member for Parkes ( Mr,33
NA,Hughes)-h e has fled the field but I have,33
NA,no doubt he will return because he is a,33
NA,man of great honour and intrepid political,33
NA,capacity but with a lack of sagacity in this,33
NA,matter-sai d that we were unable to face,33
NA,up to the basic difficulties in ratifying this,33
NA,question in a federal system. This afternoon,33
NA,an attempt was made to dodge the issue,33
NA,by means of a point of order which was,33
NA,taken by my friend the honourable member,33
NA,"for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp), and by means",33
NA,of remarks in the debate to the effect that,33
NA,some questions which we bave raised today,33
NA,are sub judice. The subject of equal pay,33
NA,for women is supposed to be sub judice.,33
NA,The matter of land rights of Aboriginals is,33
NA,"supposed to be sub judice. I for one, speak-",33
NA,"ing in the forum of this Parliament, do not",33
NA,recognise that sanction whatsoever. This,33
NA,Parliament must be in a position at any time,33
NA,to discuss whatsoever it needs to discuss and,33
NA,ought to discuss. It ought not be restricted,33
NA,in any way in these discussions.,33
NA,What are our duties? It has been said,33
NA,here that wc should look at comparable,33
NA,"countries. In fact, there are very few com-",33
NA,parable countries. Of the 130 nations in,33
NA,the world very few have our standard of,33
NA,living and very few now have continuing,33
NA,political stability. But of those 130 nations,33
NA,only some 30 or so could claim to be,33
NA,"democratic, taking the most liberal view of",33
NA,democracy. Only 12 or 15 countries would,33
NA,measure up to the kind of society most of,33
NA,us want to live and play a part in. Until,33
NA,2 or 3 years ago there were only four,33
NA,countries in which there were no political,33
NA,prisoners and Australia was one of them.,33
NA,I. am afraid we have spoilt our record by,33
NA,the way we have treated conscientious,33
NA,objectors. So we are not here this afternoon,33
NA,to follow other people. It is time Australia,33
NA,started to set some standards. Australia is a,33
NA,foundation member of and played a form-,33
NA,ative part in the creation of the United,33
NA,Nations. Our responsibility here today is to,33
NA,see whether we can apply the principles,33
NA,that have been worked out at these inter-,33
NA,"national organisations, to get them cracking",33
NA,in this community and not look continuously,33
NA,for an escape hatch.,33
NA,Like my colleagues the honourable mem-,33
NA,ber for Oxley ( Mr Hayden) and the Leader,33
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) I want to,33
NA,refer to the question of the Aboriginal,33
NA,people of Australia and talk about our,33
NA,"responsibility there, because our responsi-",33
NA,"bilities are now clear-cut. Has my friend,",33
NA,the honourable member for Parkes not,33
NA,"noted that in 1967, some 2 years ago, the",33
NA,people accepted a referendum proposal,33
NA,which placed the responsibility for,33
NA,Aboriginal people fairly and squarely on,33
NA,"this House, and that in fact the federal",33
NA,"system no Longer need apply in this regard,",34
NA,"if we have the sense, the wit and",34
NA,moral attitude towards,34
NA,"Aboriginals of Australia, 21,000 of whom",34
NA,live in the Northern Territory. We have,34
NA,also the responsibility to apply the high,34
NA,principles which are expressed in the prestates:,34
NA,amble to the amended constitution of the,34
NA,International Labor Organisation which we,34
NA,adopted when we put it into the Act in,34
NA,1947-49. I t reads:,34
NA,"The High Contracting Parties, moved by sentiis",34
NA,ments of justice and humanity as well as by,34
NA,desire to secure the permanent peace of the,34
NA,and with a view to attaining the objectives,34
NA,"forth in this Preamble, agree to the following",34
NA,Constitution of the International,34
NA,tion:,34
NA,Now let me come to ILO Convention No.,34
NA,107. How is it that we are unable to apply,34
NA,this convention? It seems to me that the,34
NA,issues are clear-cut and that our responsipeople,34
NA,bilities are well defined. Our constitutional,34
NA,responsibilities now Jie with this Parliament.,34
NA,Morally and in every other way it is our,34
NA,bounden duty to get on with the job.,34
NA,Article 2 of the Convention states:,34
NA,Government shall have the primary responsibility,34
NA,for developing co-ordinated and systematic,34
NA,for the protection of the populations concerned,34
NA,and their progressive integration into the life,34
NA,their respective countries.,34
NA,There is nothing in that section which has,34
NA,been beyond the scope of this Parliament.,34
NA,"This has been the case since May 1957, at shall",34
NA,least. Article 3 states:,34
NA,. . . special measures shall be adopted for,34
NA,"protection of the institutions, persons, property",34
NA,labour of these populations.,34
NA,This afternoon the point was made that we,34
NA,may not bring up the question of the people,34
NA,"of Yirrkala, who I believe are being visited",34
NA,"trampled on rather unceremoniously,",34
NA,because the matter is sub judice. But the,34
NA,fact is that the culture and institutions,34
NA,these people are not being treated with,34
NA,proper regard. This would also apply to,34
NA,Aboriginals at Wattie Creek and other,34
NA,Aboriginals in other parts of Australia.,34
NA,There are two or three other instances in,34
NA,which people are being moved off their,34
NA,land and that land is being taken over,34
NA,commercial purposes. Article 4 of the,34
NA,Convention states:,34
NA,due account shall be taken of the cultural and,34
NA,religious values and of the forms of social control,34
NA,Have we really observed that? Do we really,34
NA,the right observe it even in Papua and New,34
NA,"the 80,000 Guinea where, strange to say, we bave",34
NA,often been more tender about the rights of,34
NA,the people than we have about the rights,34
NA,of the Aboriginals in Australia. Article 6,34
NA,The improvement of the conditions of life and,34
NA,"work, and level of education of tbe populations",34
NA,concerned shall be given high priority . . .,34
NA,What have we done in that field? There,34
NA,nothing to stop us. No State government,34
NA,the is going to cavil if we produce plans which,34
NA,"world, are definite and dynamic in the field of the",34
NA,set development of Aboriginals and of their,34
NA,Labour Organisaeducation.,34
NA,I visited Yirrkala as recently as January.,34
NA,I have been there four or five times in the,34
NA,last 5 or so years. On each occasion I have,34
NA,taken a look to see what steps have been,34
NA,taken for the vocational training of these,34
NA,to meet the confrontation which will,34
NA,happen as a result of the mining develop-,34
NA,ment. I can see very little evidence of any,34
NA,such steps. Article 9 of the convention states:,34
NA,Except in cases prescribed by law for all citizens,34
NA,the exaction from the mcmbers of the populations,34
NA,concerned of compulsory personal services . . .,34
NA,action shall be prohibited. . . .,34
NA,of Do we take any steps to see that on pastoral,34
NA,properties and other places this type of,34
NA,service is not exacted from the Aboriginal,34
NA,people? Article 10 of the Convention states:,34
NA,Persons belonging to the populations concerned,34
NA,be specially safeguarded against the improper,34
NA,application of preventive detention. . . .,34
NA,thc It is time we did something about that.,34
NA,"and Back in January, accompanied by some of",34
NA,"my colleagues, I. visited the Woorabinda",34
NA,settlement in Queensland. An apologist for,34
NA,the system from the Melbourne 'Herald',34
NA,the place a few days later and said:,34
NA,"'Well, the prison was all right. It was cooler",34
NA,inside the prison than it was in the office.',34
NA,"of The prison, in fact, was as I described it.",34
NA,It was similar to the cells which were used,34
NA,the at Port Arthur over a century ago. The,34
NA,prison in this Aboriginal settlement con-,34
NA,sisted of 8 ft by 10 ft reinforced concrete,34
NA,cells. The prisoners are locked up in them,34
NA,for 14 days for the vicious and deplorable,34
NA,for and abominable crime of overdrinking. I,34
NA,say it is a pity this punishment was not,34
NA,applied-speakin g a.s a wowser-t o a lot,34
NA,of other people i f this is the system that,34
NA,"we are to adopt. But, of course, we do not",34
NA,apply it to others.,34
NA,What I am saying this afternoon is that,35
NA,most of the principles contained in Con-,35
NA,vention 107 are ones most members of this,35
NA,House would adopt in their personal rela-,35
NA,tionships. They are mostly ones that people,35
NA,here would say are correct and in line with,35
NA,the generally established ethics and morality,35
NA,of the people of this community. I can think,35
NA,of no sound reason why Convention 107,35
NA,ought not be adopted. It may well be that,35
NA,until the referendum in 1967 the Conven-,35
NA,tion could not have been ratified because,35
NA,there were 6 State authorities and 2 Com-,35
NA,"monwealth authorities, 1 here and the other",35
NA,in the Northern Territory. It also may well,35
NA,be that this matter was complicated by State,35
NA,rights and such things. But that situation no,35
NA,"longer exists. The political power, the con-",35
NA,stitutional authority and the dynamics of,35
NA,the whole system lie in this Parliament.,35
NA,While one may be able to say about equal,35
NA,wages-an d I do not agree with it-tha t,35
NA,"there are constitutional difficulties, and",35
NA,while this may apply to some other con-,35
NA,"vention, it does not apply to Convention",35
NA,107. It ought not apply to Convention 111,35
NA,and it should not apply to any of the con-,35
NA,ventions that are applicable to our external,35
NA,territories.,35
NA,"So, this afternoon, when we say we are",35
NA,concerned and disappointed at the Govern-,35
NA,ment's failure to establish principles of policy,35
NA,"in line with ILO conventions, we are not",35
NA,speaking here just simply for the sake of,35
NA,politics. We are speaking because we believe,35
NA,that in this field at least Australia has the,35
NA,capacity and the social dynamics established,35
NA,in the past to set up standards for the rest,35
NA,of the world and should not wait for some-,35
NA,one else to set the signpost up for us.,35
Mr CHIPP ,Higinbotham) [4.48]-,35
NA,Today we have had a very clever subterfuge,35
NA,perpetrated on this House by honourable,35
NA,members of the Opposition. I suppose it is,35
NA,good tactics in an election year to propose,35
NA,matters of public importance for discussion,35
NA,in this House each day. It gives the Opposi-,35
NA,"tion a chance of obtaining headlines, and",35
NA,this is good tactics. I can visualise the dis-,35
NA,cussion that was held by the Executive of,35
NA,the Australian Labor Party when it met,35
NA,"tbis week. When someone said: 'Well, Mr",35
NA,"Chairman, what is the matter to be pro-",35
NA,"posed for discussion on Wednesday?', I can",35
NA,imagine the honourable member for Stirling,35
NA,"( Mr Webb) would have chimed up and said,",35
NA,'What about giving equal pay another run?',35
NA,Someone with some sense of honour would,35
NA,"have said: 'No, we cannot do that because",35
NA,it is being discussed at the moment by the,35
NA,Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitra-,35
NA,tion Commission'. Now we see the subter-,35
NA,fuge- a rather clever one. Equal pay is not,35
NA,the item on the agenda; it is the ratification,35
NA,of the International Labor Organisation's,35
NA,conventions. Once the honourable member,35
NA,for Stirling paid lip service to this for about,35
NA,"60 seconds, he then proceeded for the rest",35
NA,of his speech to discuss equal pay. This,35
NA,was notwithstanding a point of order 1 took.,35
NA,I am glad I did this because I was able to,35
NA,register my deep concern. I now re-register,35
NA,"my concern, Mr Deputy Speaker. While",35
NA,paying ultimate courtesy to Mr Speaker and,35
NA,"to yourself, I think this Parliament is drift-",35
NA,ing into a very dangerous method of pro-,35
NA,"cedure if, when a matter is before a court,",35
NA,"or a body such as the Commission, which",35
NA,"has all the stature and facilities of a court,",35
NA,that matter is allowed to be debated by,35
NA,politicians in the heat and the cut and thrust,35
NA,of parliamentary debate..If this is done I,35
NA,think the integrity of one of our most,35
NA,"precious institutions, the judiciary, will be",35
NA,under some threat.,35
NA,"However, having made that comment,",35
NA,"which I do with respect, let me come back",35
NA,"to the substance, if one can so natter it, of",35
NA,the matter of public importance which is,35
NA,before the Chair. The honourable member,35
NA,"for Stirling, who is a notoriously gallant",35
NA,"man as far as ladies are concerned, ended",35
NA,his speech with a rather extraordinary,35
NA,attack on the women of today. He said-,35
NA,and I hope I do not misquote him-tha t,35
NA,the women of today do not have the sting,35
NA,and the courage of their counterparts 50,35
NA,years ago. I hope the honourable member,35
NA,for Watson ( Mr Cope) will admonish his,35
NA,colleague for being so ungallant in this the,35
NA,twentieth century. What a dreadful thing to,35
NA,say! Why blame the women of today for,35
NA,the present situation? The honourable mem-,35
NA,"ber for Stirling, who has had considerable",35
NA,"experience in the trade union movement,",35
NA,knows very well that no trade union in,35
NA,Australia has raised the question of equal,35
NA,pay since this Government has been in,35
NA,office. The Government came into office in,35
NA,1949. For 19 years the trade union move-,35
NA,ment has not brought this matter before an,35
NA,industrial tribunal in any form. With,35
NA,"respect to you, Sir. I challenge any honour-",36
NA,able member opposite to quarrel with that,36
NA,by way of interjection. They cannot because,36
NA,"it is an absolute fact. Instead, we have the",36
NA,facade of an equal pay debate raised twice,36
NA,a year in this Parliament by Opposition pub-,36
NA,licity seekers to keep the pot boiling as,36
NA,far as the women are concerned. I take,36
NA,objection to the honourable member for,36
NA,Stirling blaming the women of today for,36
NA,the situation which exists.,36
NA,I wish to refer briefly to the International,36
NA,Labour Organisation conventions themselves.,36
NA,The honourable member for Stirling and,36
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam),36
NA,know full well that the ILO conventions,36
NA,"are not adopted, cannot be adopted and",36
NA,were not meant to be adopted by all mem-,36
NA,ber states attending ILO conferences. The,36
NA,statistics would in a flash indicate that this,36
NA,is true. The average number of ratifications,36
NA,per member nation is 29. The honourable,36
NA,member for Stirling knows this. Why does,36
NA,he not say so and put his case in proper,36
NA,context? Australia has ratified 26 of the,36
NA,resolutions which have been brought for-,36
NA,ward. Some of the resolutions brought for-,36
NA,"ward are clearly inappropriate to Australia,",36
NA,as the honourable member well knows.,36
NA,Canada hns ratified only 24 and the United,36
NA,"States only 7. Of course, the honourable",36
NA,member would be aware of this. He would,36
NA,also know that under the constitution of,36
NA,the ILO a membeT state is not obliged to,36
NA,ratify a convention and that until a con-,36
NA,vention is ratified by a member state that,36
NA,state has no obligation to obey it. On this,36
NA,point I wish to refer to the comments made,36
NA,by the Leader of the Opposition. The,36
NA,honourable gentleman makes an outward,36
NA,fetish of credibility. He has an obsession,36
NA,about the credibility of other people. He,36
NA,should look inwards at some stage and,36
NA,examine his own credibility. He said that,36
NA,Australia now has a legal obligation under,36
NA,the conventions to grant equal pay and other,36
NA,things. So that I cannot be accused of being,36
NA,"inaccurate in quoting what he said today,",36
NA,I will also quote what he said on 18th May,36
NA,1965. It appears at page 1565 of Hansard.,36
NA,"Referring to equal pay, the Leader of",36
NA,Opposition said:,36
NA,The Commonwealth now has some obligations,36
NA,internationally.,36
NA,"So, he is on record as having said it.",36
NA,he knows as well as anybody else in,36
NA,place tbat Australia has no legal obligations,36
NA,to follow these conventions until it has in,36
NA,fact ratified them. As the honourable mem-,36
NA,"ber for Canning ( Mr Hallett) said, we rely",36
NA,on the conciliation and arbitration system,36
NA,to bring changes of wage conditions and,36
NA,wage rates into being.,36
NA,I come now to the effect of equal pay,36
NA,on the economy. I state categorically that,36
NA,I am for equal pay. I have stated this before.,36
NA,But I want it implemented in such a way,36
NA,that it will not fracture our economy or,36
NA,disadvantage the women who now consti-,36
NA,tute 30% of the work force. Over 1.5,36
NA,million females are now in the work force.,36
NA,What would be the effect on certain indus-,36
NA,"tries, such as the food processing industry",36
NA,"and the textile industry, where a predomi-",36
NA,"nance of females is employed, if equal pay",36
NA,for work of equal value were immediately,36
NA,impacted on them? The obvious result would,36
NA,be wholesale unemployment of women in,36
NA,those industries and skyrocketing costs.,36

NA,significant component of the cost of living,36

NA,without the expertise and analytical back-,36
NA,"ground of a full scale investigation, which",36
NA,only the Commonwealth Conciliation and,36

NA,"pluck a figure out of the air-sa y $200m,",36
NA,$300m or $400m-a s an estimate of what,36
NA,equal pay would cost the economy without,36
NA,going into it in a scientific way? The Oppo-,36
NA,sition regards this subject as a matter of,36
NA,definite public importance and has brought,36
NA,on the debate on that basis. I regard the,36
NA,Opposition's attitude as sheer humbug be-,36
NA,cause the Commonwealth has already made,36
NA,it quite clear in the case that is being heard,36
NA,"at present, as the honourable member for",36
NA,"Stirling would know, that it does not object",36
NA,"to equal pay. Mr Woodward, Q.C, has",36
NA,stated the Commonwealth's position. The,36
NA,Commonwealth is in favour of it. He has,36
NA,pleaded with the Commission not to allow,36
NA,any undue delay in its decision.,36
NA,"In conclusion, may I add one more",36
NA,the remark of my own? I hope that equal pay,36
NA,for women will be with us soon because,36
NA,I have never been persuaded of the justice,36
NA,or the equity of a breadwinner in a family,36
NA,who docs precisely the same work as a,36
NA,But man and with equal efficiency having to,36
NA,this go home with a pay packet which is,36
NA,reduced by 25% and look after an aged,37
NA,or ill mother. The same applies with a,37
NA,widow who has to look after 3 or 4,37
NA,children. I make the plea that I have,37
NA,made before in this House: If the Com-,37
NA,misison does not see its way clear to equate,37
NA,"wage levels at this point of time, will the",37
NA,Government take action of a social services,37
NA,nature to equate the income of the female,37
NA,breadwinners in a family with that of their,37
NA,male counterparts until such time as equal,37
NA,pay is instituted for equal work?,37

NA,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1969,37
NA,Second Reading,37
NA,Debate resumed from 26 March (vide,37
NA,"page 917), on motion by Mr Swartz:",37
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,37
NA,"Mr Erwin- Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek",37
NA,the indulgence of the House to raise a,37
NA,matter of procedure. This Bill and the,37
NA,Pay-roll Tax Assessment Bill are associated,37
NA,measures. It would no doubt meet the con-,37
NA,venience of honourable members if the,37
NA,House were to have a general second,37
NA,reading debate covering both Bills. At the,37
NA,conclusion of the debate separate questions,37
NA,"will, of course, be put on each of the",37
NA,"Bills. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that",37
NA,you permit this course to be followed.,37
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Ther e being,37
NA,"no objection, I will allow this course to",37
NA,followed.,37
Mr CREAN ,Melbourne Ports) [4.59]-,37
NA,These Bills involve technical amendments,37
NA,to the Income Tax Assessment Act and the,37
NA,Pay-roll Tax Assessment Act respectively.,37
NA,The short title of each Bill seems to have,37
NA,been carefully chosen so as to preclude,37
NA,general debate on income tax and pay-roll,37
NA,tax matters. The first Bill is described as,37
NA,a Bill for an Act to amend sections 23c,37
NA,and 160AC of the Income Tax Assessment,37
NA,Act 1936-58 and to make certain conse-,37
NA,quential provisions. The second Bill is,37
NA,described as a Bill for an Act to amend,37
NA,the Pay-roll Tax Assessment Act 1941-1968,37
NA,in relation to rebates of tax allowable to,37
NA,producers of gold.,37
NA,"In fact, both sets of amendments to each",37
NA,of the Bills deal with the taxing of the,37
NA,"sales of gold. This, I suppose, arises from",37
NA,what is now described as the 'two tier,37
NA,"system' of gold pricing. Certain gold, in as",37
NA,far as it enters into central banking trans-,37
NA,"actions, is sold at a fixed price of SUS35 an",37
NA,"ounce, and it has been set at tbatfigurefor",37
NA,"almost 40 years now. However, certain gold",37
NA,is allowed to be sold on what is described,37
NA,as the 'free market'. Much of it is sold in,37
NA,"Hong Kong, some in Australia and some on",37
NA,commercial markets in various parts of the,37
NA,world. But it has been the practice of the,37
NA,"Australian Government, and of previous",37
NA,"Australian governments, to subsidise the pro-",37
NA,"duction of gold by, in effect, making it free",37
NA,from the impact of income tax. If a profit is,37
NA,made from gold mining it is not liable to,37
NA,bear any income tax at all. This has been,37
NA,"a deliberate policy of governments and, of",37
NA,"course, the gold industry in Australia today",37
NA,"is confined primarily to one State, and to",37
NA,one very small part of that State-t o the,37
NA,city of Kalgoorlie and the areas around,37
NA,about it. Slightly less than 1 million ounces,37
NA,of gold per annum is still mined in Aus-,37
NA,"tralia, most of it from the Kalgoorlie fields,",37
NA,and it earns foreign exchange for Australia,37
NA,of about $30m to $35m.,37
NA,Here we have one of the sections of our,37
NA,"income tax legislation-and , to a certain",37
NA,"extent, the same applies to pay-roll tax, be-",37
NA,cause pay-roll tax is related to the provisions,37
NA,that exempt from payment of pay-roll tax,37
NA,undertakings that improve export sales dur-,37
NA,ing the year-wher e forms of taxation are,37
NA,being used to secure what essentially are not,37
NA,be revenue provisions at all. We are endeavour-,37
NA,ing to obtain what we call 'desirable econo-,37
NA,mic and social practices' by reason of the,37
NA,concessions that are available in our taxa-,37
NA,tion legislation. I have in my possession a,37
NA,document that I secured from the office of,37
NA,the Treasurer ( Mr MCMahon) a short time,37
NA,ago. It is entitled 'Income Tax for the,37
NA,Mining Industry' and contains some 80,37
NA,fairly closely printed pages indicating the,37
NA,concessions that are available to the gold,37
NA,mining industry and also for the search and,37
NA,production of oil.,37
NA,In recent days there has been quite a,37
NA,debate in the financial Press about the tax,37
NA,provisions which were ostensibly designed,37
NA,to encourage the search for and the produc-,37
NA,tion of oil in Australia. No-one would deny,37
NA,that oil has great economic significance for,37
NA,"Australia, because we bave an annual bill",37
NA,amounting to some hundreds of millions of,37
NA,"dollars for the import of oil. Of course,",37
NA,Australia is a country where the number,38
NA,of motor cars has increased rapidly. I think,38
NA,the motor car population is rising at a,38
NA,"faster rate than is our population, and this",38
NA,places a great toll upon our roads and,38
NA,upon petrol and so forth. All of our petrol,38
NA,"requirements, or most of them until last",38
NA,"year, came from overseas. In order to en-",38
NA,courage the search for and the extraction,38
NA,of oil certain concessions were given in,38
NA,income tax provisions. They had the bless-,38
NA,ings of both sides of the House when they,38
NA,were passed but recently it has seemed,38
NA,that the provisions that were thought to,38
NA,encourage the search for and the physical,38
NA,production of oil are being used by people,38
NA,for purely speculative purposes. At the,38
NA,moment Australia is being obsessed by what,38
NA,might be called a 'speculamania' which goes,38
NA,all the way from the price of individual,38
NA,pieces of land to the search for minerals,38
NA,"and natural resources. Again, one cannot",38
NA,be too categorical about this.,38
NA,I noticed yesterday that when a question,38
NA,was addressed to the Treasurer he was,38
NA,rather cautious in his answer. I think that,38
NA,perhaps he had reason to be cautious be-,38
NA,"cause, unfortunately, it is difiicult sometimes",38
NA,to determine who is a speculator and who,38
NA,is a genuine investor serving the purposes,38
NA,that the provisions were designed to cover.,38
NA,This is why I repeat a suggestion that I,38
NA,made on another occasion in this House.,38
NA,Some of the provisions are too complicated,38
NA,"in their nature and, in essence, they do",38
NA,"not collect tax, they rather see that tax is",38
NA,npt collected. They have a sort of negative,38
NA,effect which is designed to promote the,38
NA,economic benefit that the Government hns,38
NA,in mind. I submit thaf many of these pro-,38
NA,positions are too complicated io be satis-,38
NA,factorily evaluated by the ordinary legisla-,38
NA,tive processes that are available to the,38
NA,House. I point out that part of the reason,38
NA,for the amendments being before us today,38
NA,is the discovery that the legislation does not,38
NA,do what it was intended to do. In other,38
NA,"words, there are mistakes in the wording",38
NA,"of the legislation which, consequently, does",38
NA,not give effect to the intent of the legisla-,38
NA,tion. This seems to me to be the case,38
NA,at present. An argument is going on about,38
NA,whether or not certain calls and certain,38
NA,capital subscriptions to oil companies,38
NA,ought or ought not to be allowable for taxa-,38
NA,tion purposes. I submit that when a matter,38
NA,is as important as this there ought to be,38
NA,some machinery by means of which these,38
NA,complaints can be properly evaluated.,38
NA,Sometimes I am astonished at the things,38
NA,that nnancial journalists regard as imagina-,38
NA,tive. This is a little bit off the trail of this,38
NA,"Bill, but it is relevant to the argument that",38
NA,I am following. I refer to the enthusiasm,38
NA,that has been engendered among nnancial,38
NA,journalists for the new device called the,38
NA,'certificate of deposit'. Apparently if a,38
NA,"person holds a deposit, provided he has",38
NA,"units of $50,000-whic h takes it out of the",38
NA,province of most men in the street-an d,38
NA,turns the deposit from a fixed deposit into,38
NA,some other kind of account at the same,38
NA,"bank, it can earn him something like",38
NA,another i % . Why this is supposed to pro-,38
NA,mote the economic development of Aus-,38
NA,tralia is beyond me. Nevertheless there are,38
NA,people writing in nnancial journals who get,38
NA,enthusiastic about this thing. 1. submit that,38
NA,something of the same kind of hysteria has,38
NA,crept in recently concerning the condem-,38
NA,nation of the practices that are going on,38
NA,in respect of investments in oil companies.,38
NA,I do not think that anybody denied originally,38
NA,that the provisions of the law were bene-,38
NA,"ficial, but if the provisions are being",38
NA,breached for other than the development,38
NA,"reason, there is a case for re-examining the",38
NA,law. In order that the law may be re-,38
NA,examined it should be open for considera-,38
NA,tion by people other than the experts in,38
NA,the Department and the experts who mani-,38
NA,pulate activities on the stock exchange.,38
NA,There are other genuine pockets of interests,38
NA,in the community in which there are people,38
NA,who deserve to have access to the sort of,38
NA,information that is necessary to make a,38
NA,proper appraisal of this sort of situation.,38
NA,I believe that the matter is important,38
NA,because in the mineral field-an d here we,38
NA,"are talking about only one mineral, gold-",38
NA,we talk about spending in the next 2 or,38
NA,"3 years as much as $1,500m or $2,000m.",38
NA,To some extent the question of where that,38
NA,money is spent is conditioned by the taxa-,38
NA,tion concessions that are allowed. To a,38
NA,great extent the Commonwealth is under-,38
NA,writing this kind of expenditure by revenue,38
NA,"forgone, but sometimes the transactions are",38
NA,encompassed in such a way that they yield,38
NA,gains to sections of the community in the,38
NA,form of capital accretions that are not,38
NA,always easily tied down for taxing purposes.,38
NA,For this reason we must have a much more,38
NA,sophisticated approach to amendments of,39
NA,this kind than is the case at present. It is,39
NA,competent for a parliament to argue about,39
NA,the incidence of income tax and the rates,39
NA,of income tax as these affect individuals in,39
NA,the community. It is competent for the,39
NA,Parliament to consider what is the basic,39
NA,"rate of tax, what is taxed and what is not",39
NA,taxed. The same applies to a great extent,39
NA,to the basic rate of company tax. I t is when,39
NA,we come to these special kinds of provisions,39
NA,that we should be especially careful.,39
NA,"The taxing of insurance companies, for",39
NA,"instance, is another way in which the",39
NA,income tax legislation is used as a means,39
NA,of achieving what are thought to be,39
NA,"desirable social objectives, although they",39
NA,may not be directly connected with the,39
NA,collection of income tax itself. Often,39
NA,matters of this kind are so complicated in,39
NA,themselves and can become so esoteric that,39
NA,the ordinary person can know very little,39
NA,about them. Often the first he hears of them,39
NA,is when somebody complains that a racket,39
NA,"is being worked, if I may use a term that",39
NA,is sometimes employed in this connection.,39
NA,A famous judge many years ago in England,39
NA,said that every person was entitled so to,39
NA,manage his own economic affairs that he,39
NA,paid the minimum of tax that he was,39
NA,"legally obliged to pay. Nevertheless, if",39
NA,clever people try to drive coaches and,39
NA,horses through the spirit of the law. the,39
NA,legislature is entitled to take its remedy by,39
NA,closing the loophole that allows that avoid-,39
NA,ance. I know that some people are very,39
NA,sensitive about whether one should use the,39
NA,word 'evade' or the word 'avoid'. One can,39
NA,sometimes cloak what one's left hand is,39
NA,doing by making that kind of dubious dis-,39
NA,tinction. It is a fact that in many cases as,39
NA,soon as a provision is made in the law some,39
NA,"clever person seeks a way to get round it,",39
NA,and that way usually enhances his income,39
NA,and often destroys the very principle on,39
NA,which the concession in question had been,39
NA,granted.,39
NA,I do not make any judgment one way,39
NA,or the other in the argument that is going,39
NA,on about calls and subscriptions in oil com-,39
NA,panies other than to suggest that the matter,39
NA,ought to be probed very carefully by the,39
NA,Treasury. I think also that other bodies of,39
NA,opinion ought to be given a chance to,39
NA,"indicate their views, and that we should not",39
NA,simply accept the opinion of the two sets,39
NA,of experts who are involved. Having made,39
NA,"these few additional remarks, Mr Speaker,",39
NA,I may say that the Opposition offers no,39
NA,objection to either of these measures we,39

Mr CREAN ,Melbourne Ports) [5.19]-,40
NA,The Opposition has no objection to accept-,40

NA,that it supports one of the contentions 1,40
NA,"have been putting this afternoon, that these",40
NA,matters are so complicated that we have,40
NA,to rely on this kind of information being,40
NA,provided from outside. I am sure that the,40
NA,legislation would have gone through just as,40
NA,easily with the one figure as with the other.,40
NA,This in my view reinforces the need for,40
NA,some different kind of process at least for,40

NA,AUDIT BILL 1969,40
NA,Second Reading,40
NA,Debate resumed from 26th March (vide,40
NA,"page 919), on motion by Mr Swartz:",40
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time,40
Mr CREAN ,Melbourne Ports) [5.22]-,40
NA,The amendments contained in the Bill are,40
NA,described as technical amendments but i'ney,40
NA,are different to those of the Income Tax,40
NA,Assessment Bill and the Pay-roll Tax Assess-,40
NA,ment Bill. It seems to me that the short,40
NA,title of the Bill is wide enough to enable,40
NA,a general debate on all the principles of the,40
NA,Audit Act. This is a Bill for an Act relating,40
NA,to the audit of public moneys and the,40
NA,"protection of public property, and it seeks",40
NA,"to amend the Act of 1901-64, which has thc",40
NA,broad title 'An Act to make provision for,40
NA,the collection and payment of the public,40
NA,moneys the audit of the public accounts,40
NA,and the protection and recovery of public,40
NA,property and for other purposes'.,40
NA,For the most part the amendments deal,40
NA,with the handling of what is described as,40
NA,the Governor-General's warrant. It is one,40
NA,of the established practices of British par-,40
NA,"liamentary procedures, which Australia",40
NA,"follows, that no sum of public money",40
NA,should be expended unless that expenditure,40
NA,has the sanction of Parliament. We go,40
NA,through the process annually of passing a,40
NA,Budget which is supposed to authorise the,40
NA,expenditure of every single dollar that is,40
NA,spent by the Commonwealth of Australia,40
NA,in a period commencing on 1st July of one,40
NA,year and concluding on 30th June in the,40
NA,following year. That period is known as a,40
NA,financial year. It is true that there are,40
NA,one or two measures to bridge the gap,40
NA,caused by the fact that Parliament does,40
NA,not meet on lst July to determine expendi-,40
NA,ture for the next 12 months. The Budget,40
NA,"does not come down until August, and by",40
NA,that time almost 2 months of the financial,40
NA,year have passed. So supply is provided,40
NA,in advance. And because modern govern-,40
NA,ments cannot always conceive at the,40
NA,beginning of a year what is likely to happen,40
NA,at the end of it provision is made for,40
NA,Supplementary Estimates. Also in Australia,40
NA,we have what is called the Treasurer's,40
NA,Advance where a block sum of about $20m,40
NA,is set aside for expenditure for which the,40
NA,Treasurer can give authority until finally it,40
NA,is sanctioned in the Supplementary Esti-,40
NA,mates.,40
NA,Each Government department does not,40
NA,get at the beginning of a year all the,40
NA,money that it wants during the course of,40
NA,that. year. It receives its money by a series,40
NA,of dribblings out. There are two reasons,40
NA,"for that. First, it enables some control to",40
NA,be kept. If all of us were to have our,40
NA,annual salary paid in advance we might,40
NA,not be quite as prudent as we are when,40
NA,paid each fortnight or each month. We,41
NA,tend to budget during the course of the,41
NA,year and so to some extent can exercise,41
NA,control. The other reason is that the,41
NA,Government does not collect all its money,41
NA,immediately. Taxes are paid throughout,41
NA,the year. Direct taxes are paid periodically,41
NA,"as people receive their assessments, and",41
NA,indirect taxes are paid daily as people,41
NA,"purchase items such as motor vehicles, beer",41
NA,and cigarettes. It is for those two reasons,41
NA,that departments cannot be paid their full,41
NA,entitlement when the Budget is approved.,41
NA,"Nevertheless, I suppose that in a strict",41
NA,sense once the Budget has been passed,41
NA,and the Parliament has approved the total,41
NA,"amount that is payable to a department,",41
NA,"it does not matter a great deal whether,",41
NA,"as was previously the case, it is paid",41
NA,"quarterly for groups of items, or, as is now",41
NA,"proposed, item by item.",41
NA,I would tbink that in 1969 we ought to,41
NA,have a different eoncept of what is des-,41
NA,cribed broadly as the auditing of the,41
NA,Government accounts to what we had in,41
NA,1901 when the Audit Act was first passed.,41
NA,1 have not had the opportunity to see what,41
NA,sort of fundamental amendments have been,41
NA,made to the Audit Act since it was first,41
NA,"passed, but I doubt whether if the Auditor-",41
NA,General were to follow the strict letter of,41
NA,the Act that would be a satisfactory way,41
NA,of looking after the financial undertakings,41
NA,of the Government of Australia. The,41
NA,Auditor-General has perhaps had to develop,41
NA,discretionary powers that technically are,41
NA,written into the Act. I hope that he has.,41
NA,One of the reasons for the amendments,41
NA,"now before us is the influence, if you like,",41
NA,of the computer upon the processes of,41
NA,government accounting. I am one of those,41
NA,who still claim to be rather mystified by,41
NA,processes of the computer. I asked someone,41
NA,rather recently: 'How do you audit a,41
NA,"computer?' He, being one of Australia's",41
NA,"leading experts in this field, said: 'It",41
NA,"bit harder to And the audit trial, but you",41
NA,feed your trial samples into the computer'-,41
NA,"just the same, I presume, as happened with",41
NA,the checks in the old days when ledgers,41
NA,were hand processed.,41
NA,Unfortunately this Bill was introduced,41
NA,into the House on the afternoon of the,41
NA,Thursday on which the House adjourned,41
NA,for the Easter recess and I did not have time,41
NA,to go down to see the computer establish-,41
NA,ment in the Treasury building. What I did,41
NA,in the fortnight during the Easter break,41
NA,was to go into the Department of Social,41
NA,Services and see the computer mechanism in,41
NA,operation there. The way in which the com-,41
NA,puter picks up mistakes is astonishing. 1,41
NA,was rather intrigued when shown a few,41
NA,samples of documents that had been put,41
NA,through the computer. One was returned,41
NA,because of a mistake by the clerk engaged,41
NA,in manual operations who had written,41
NA,across the document '31st June 1969'.,41
NA,Apparently the computer knew that old,41
NA,"rhyme: Thirty days hath September, April,",41
NA,June and November'. Back the document,41
NA,came with the mistake corrected. That is,41
NA,"only, 1 suppose, a minor kind of exercise.",41
NA,"Nevertheless, the arrangements there enable",41
NA,"about 200,000 cheques a fortnight to be",41
NA,issued. The Victorian office of the Depart-,41
NA,ment of Social Services accounts for about,41
NA,a quarter of total social service payments.,41
NA,The annual bill for age pensions last year,41
NA,was about S520m-$10 m a week or $20m,41
NA,a fortnights-an d Victoria's share of that,41
NA,was about $5m a fortnight. The cheques are,41
NA,simply churned out like great rolls of,41
NA,paper. Even the signatures are applied non-,41
NA,manually.,41
NA,This brings home immediately that,41
NA,efficiency in government departments and,41
NA,the efficacy of the audit are no longer,41
NA,questions of chasing money. I do not think,41
NA,there have been any large scale frauds in,41
NA,government departments recently. I noticed,41
NA,not that the Auditor-General drew attention to,41
NA,one in the Department of Customs and,41
NA,"Excise, but apparently that involved col-",41
NA,lusion between people outside and people,41
NA,inside the Department. The handling of,41
NA,cash in departments no longer seems to,41
NA,the present a great problem. Auditing ought,41
NA,now to be turned in the direction of,41
NA,efficiency of departments. There is no diffi-,41
NA,"culty, it seems to me, about whether a",41
NA,"is a warrant is issued monthly, quarterly,",41
NA,"annually, or item by item, or whether it is",41
NA,signed or countersigned by this person rather,41
NA,than that. I would think that what is not,41
NA,properly evaluated often is what happens,41
NA,to the money once it starts to be used. Time,41
NA,has been a little against me in trying to find,41
NA,some references to this but I found a rather,41
NA,interesting publication recently. The book,41
NA,apparently coincides more or less with the,41
NA,end of the first 100 years of the Audit,41
NA,Department of the United Kingdom. It is,41
NA,entitled 'The Accountability and Audit of,42
NA,"Governments, A Comparative Study', is",42
NA,"written by E. L. Normanton, and was",42
NA,published by the Manchester University,42
NA,"Press in 1966. Mr Normanton, it seems to",42
NA,"me, sums up very well the sort of problem",42
NA,that I am trying to indicate ought to concern,42
NA,us a bit more:,42
NA,If a Department had a large sum voted for,42
NA,'purchase of (unspecified) supplies' and cared to,42
NA,"spend it entirely upon green and yellow budgerigars,",42
NA,this would not be an infringement against regu-,42
NA,"larity, provided that the proper authorisation*",42
NA,were obtained and the birds were actually received.,42
NA,Their utility to the nation would be 'an,42
NA,administrative question' outside the competence of,42
NA,a state audit body charged with the sole control,42
NA,of regularity. The Minisler concerned might have,42
NA,"to face parliamentary criticism of his aviary, but",42
NA,the chances are that its very existence would not,42
NA,"become known, since the auditors would not",42
NA,report a matter which was within the formal,42
NA,rules. In this way the confusion of control of,42
NA,regularity which a proper state audit often has,42
NA,"covered, and in a few countries still does cover,",42
NA,a multitude of administrative sins. It has also,42
NA,"obscured the meaning of audit to the state, by an",42
NA,oversimplification of its role.,42
NA,I would suggest that the title of the Audit,42
NA,Act 1901-1964 certainly indicates an over-,42
NA,simplication of the role of audit.,42
NA,According to the report of the Public,42
NA,"Service Board for the year ended June 1968,",42
NA,the Auditor-General's Office has a total staff,42
NA,of 527. They deal with government trans-,42
NA,"actions that employ some 211,000 people",42
NA,and are responsible for an aggregate expen-,42
NA,"diture of $6,000m. I do not think there is",42
NA,any substantia] financial fraud. There are,42
NA,occasional instances both in government,42
NA,departments and in private business. 1 was,42
NA,astonished the other day to read that at,42
NA,relatively minor metropolitan branch of a,42
NA,bank in New South Wales some character,42
NA,"had got away with $320,000. I would not",42
NA,think that that kind of thing could happen,42
NA,in a government department unless there,42
NA,was collusion on a very substantia] scale.,42
NA,"Of this aggregate expenditure of $6,000m administer.",42
NA,"about $ 1,500m goes directly to the States.",42
NA,"About $ 1,000m goes in expenditure on",42
NA,social service benefits which are transferred,42
NA,via the revenue system from taxes collected,42
NA,to people according to their categories of,42
NA,need. This still leaves a vast sum of about,42
NA,"$3,000m. One category of expenditure alone",42
NA,-defence-account s this year for over be,42
NA,"$ 1,200m. This is a matter that the House",42
NA,ought to consider seriously.,42
NA,We have one very useful committee con-,42
NA,cerned with this project-th e Public,42
NA,Accounts Committee. Some members of it,42
NA,"are present, including its distinguished",42
NA,"Chairman, the honourable member for Swan",42
NA,( Mr Cleaver). I believe that it does a very,42
NA,competent job but these days there should,42
NA,also be other committees. We suggest there,42
NA,ought to be a separate defence estimates,42
NA,committee. I am not sure whether we ought,42
NA,to have Public Accounts Committees No. 1,42
NA,"and No. 2, but there certainly should be a",42
NA,defence estimates committee. In another,42
NA,publication from the Manchester University,42
NA,"Press entitled 'Public Sector Economies',",42
NA,"edited by Professor A. R. Prest, is a chapter",42
NA,on measuring the efficiency of government,42
NA,"expenditure, which is what I am talking",42
NA,about this afternoon.,42
NA,They say this:,42
NA,An associated problem arises from the fact that,42
NA,many government services are indivisible. For,42
NA,"example, the defence programme is 'consumed'",42
NA,by the whole community. Only one level of pro-,42
NA,"vision is possible, and there is no agreed method",42
NA,by which the value of (benefit from) the service,42
NA,can be arrived at and imputed to individual,42
NA,members of the community. It also follows that,42
NA,even those who would not voluntarily contribute,42
NA,towards the provision of such services may not bc,42
NA,able to be denied access to them. Market pricing,42
NA,cannot be used to govern efficiency in the pro-,42
NA,"vision of such services, to which a 'principle of",42
NA,exclusion' cannot be applied. The level of pro-,42
NA,"vision of services, and the allocation of their",42
NA,"costs to individual citizens, thus becomes a",42
NA,matter for political bargaining.,42
NA,I have heard a lot of speeches in this House,42
NA,by members complaining about the fact thai,42
NA,the role of Parliament has been taken away,42
NA,a and that it has been assumed by the Execu,42
NA,tive. I do not believe that a government can,42
NA,govern in a modern sort of community,42
NA,"unless it has strong executive powers, but I",42
NA,think that governments can make mistakes,42
NA,and that Ministers often do not have the,42
NA,time to check everything and to look at the,42
NA,efficiency of the departments that ihey,42
NA,The question arises of who ought to be,42
NA,responsible for this overall efficiency. I,42
NA,believe there is a better role that can still,42
NA,"be played by the Parliament. After all, if a",42
NA,government decides on political grounds-,42
NA,and all these decisions ultimately tend to,42
NA,"political-tha t it wants to spend $l,200m",42
NA,it should be as concerned as anybody else,42
NA,that it gets value for every $J that i i,42
NA,expended. It is not just a question of deter-,43
NA,mining whether the office boy is rifling the,43
NA,"morning tea money, although I think there",43
NA,is still sometimes a tendency to think that,43
NA,that is auditing. I am not being critical of,43
NA,the Auditor-General's Department here,43
NA,because I think it is a very efficient depart-,43
NA,"ment, and those officers that I have met-",43
NA,and I was a member many years ago of the,43
NA,Public Accounts Committee-ar e men of,43
NA,considerable competence. But nevertheless,43
NA,1 think that today we ought not to be just,43
NA,contemplating a few technical amendments,43
NA,of the Audit Act; I think we should bc,43
NA,looking at this question as a whole.,43
Mr SWARTZ ,Ther e is a further review.,43
Mr CREAN," 1 know, and the further",43
NA,review has been promised for a very long,43
NA,time. It was even promised when I was a,43
NA,member of the Public Accounts Committee,43
NA,and I ceased to be a member of that Com-,43
NA,"mittee in 1956, so it has been promised",43
NA,for a long time.,43
Mr SWARTZ ,I t is to be a part of the,43
NA,review.,43
Mr CREAN,Al l I am stating is that I,43
NA,hope when it does come that there will be,43
NA,comprehensive amendments to the Audit,43
NA,Act. I am pleased to know that the Minister,43
NA,for Civil Aviation ( Mr Swartz) suggests that,43
NA,it will come. I hope that it will not be treated,43
NA,quite as hurriedly as these measures have,43
NA,been. 1 believe that this sort of proposition,43
NA,should lay on the table of the House for,43
NA,about 6 months so that people inside and,43
NA,outside government can examine it because,43
NA,after all the people outside the House whose,43
NA,taxes are being expended surely have some,43
NA,right also to indicate their satisfaction or,43
NA,dissatisfaction as to what might be called,43
NA,the efficiency audit of the Government,43
NA,machine. I am not too sure that the Auditor-,43
NA,General or his staff should necessarily be,43
NA,cast in this particular role or whether it,43
NA,needs superior mechanisms in the various,43
NA,departments. These are not easy matters. 1,43
NA,know one of the complaints of the,43
NA,nationalised industries in the United King-,43
NA,dom many years ago when it was suggested,43
NA,that their day to day activities should be,43
NA,subject to parliamentary scrutiny was that,43
NA,they could not be efficient if they felt that,43
NA,someone was breathing down their neck all,43
NA,the time. I do not know how close the,43
NA,breathing down the neck of government,43
NA,"departments is, but nevertheless I tbink that",43
NA,when sums as large as is the case here are,43
NA,expended there should be some scrutiny.,43
NA,"After all, how does one evaluate govern-",43
NA,ment efficiency. One of these documents 1,43
NA,"have quoted, and 1 do not want to quote",43
NA,any more of it now but I commend it to,43
NA,anyone who is interested in this kind of,43
NA,"thing, says that as far as national accounts",43
NA,are concerned-an d we talk about econo-,43
NA,mic growth and gross national product and,43
NA,what is called the contribution of govern-,43
NA,ment to the national product-thi s is mainly,43
NA,reflected in the salaries paid to the public,43
NA,servants who perform the tasks. That is,43
NA,the way that the item of government pro-,43
NA,"duction, or a large part of it, is entered into",43
NA,the national accounts. It is simply the,43
NA,"salaries that are paid, and therefore one",43
NA,would get the rather curious result that the,43
NA,national income would appear to rise if there,43
NA,were more government servants and would,43
NA,appear to fall if a computer was installed,43
NA,and made a certain number redundant and,43
NA,they were released to go somewhere else. But,43
NA,if the computer was cheaper than the people,43
NA,disposed of-an d I have no doubt that that,43
NA,would be the case-the n it would appear,43
NA,that the national income had fallen.,43
NA,That is why sometimes strict accounting,43
NA,methods of evaluating efficiency are not,43
NA,"satisfactory. I have read, as I have no doubt",43
NA,"a lot of others have, about trying to subject",43
NA,government performance to what is called,43
NA,benefit cost analysis. I should think that,43
NA,while that kind of conjecture has some value,43
NA,in equating one proposition with another,43
NA,-i n choosing that one will do this rather',43
NA,than do that-ther e is a large number of,43
NA,fields of government activity where such,43
NA,"a method of assessing has no validity at all,",43
NA,and that is why I think that other kinds,43
NA,of devices have to be applied to see whether,43
NA,"the Government macnine, if you like, is",43
NA,being as effective in its performance as,43
NA,"it ought to be. I will conclude there, and",43
NA,I am glad of the assurance of the Minister,43
NA,that more fundamental amendments of the,43
NA,"law are contemplated, but I hope that when",43
NA,they are made that there will be adequate,43
NA,discussion. I have no doubt that there has,43
NA,already been considerable discussion between,43
NA,the Auditor-General's Department and the,43
NA,"Public Accounts Committee on it, but if",43
NA,the matter finally is to become the subject,43
NA,of legislation I think that at least members,44
NA,of tbe House and interested sections outside,44
NA,the House should be given the opportunity,44
NA,to comment on the proposed amendments.,44
Mr CLEAVER ,Swan) [5.48]- 1 have,44
NA,followed the honourable member for Melliament,44
NA,bourne Ports ( Mr Crean) with a great deal,44
NA,of interest. As usual the nonourabie member,44
NA,has brought to the subject of public,44
NA,accounting a broad expanse of experience,44
NA,both in the House and beyond it. 1 note,44
NA,bis reference to the possibility of additional,44
NA,committees. 1 am one who is beginning to,44
NA,fear that if the House of Representatives,44
NA,follows the line of the other House we will,44
NA,have members of this chamber so fully,44
NA,occupied with committee duty that we will,44
NA,never have time for other routine work.,44
NA,This is not to say that I am not a supporter,44
NA,of the analyses that parliamentary coma,44
NA,"mittees, select committees and others can",44
NA,"make. I was a little concerned, however,",44
NA,when my friend from the Opposition report,44
NA,referred to the possibility of a wider task,44
NA,to be performed by the officers of the,44
NA,monwealth Auditor-General. He talked of,44
NA,"efficiency audits, and of getting down to",44
NA,areas of investigation that seem to me closer,44
NA,to the Parliament itself and closer to,44
NA,committee activity. I would be one who,44
NA,would think that the task of the Auditormaking,44
NA,General is pretty clearly defined and has,44
NA,been magnificently performed. Speaking on,44
NA,behalf of the Parliamentary Committee,44
NA,"Public Accounts, I would point out that",44
NA,Committee has repeatedly paid tribute to,44
NA,the efficiency of the Auditor-General.,44
NA,would hope that we would not try to deflect,44
NA,him and his staff from a very clear-cut,44
NA,"responsibility, to which 1 would like to refer",44
NA,later in my remarks.,44
NA,Sitting suspended from 5.51 to 8 p.m.,44
Mr CLEAVER,I n continuing my reand,44
NA,marks upon the Audit Bill which is before,44
NA,"the House, I would like to say that the",44
NA,"Audit Act is, in my opinion, the fundamenmain",44
NA,tal legislation which supports the appropriabeen,44
NA,"tion procedures, the control of funds and",44
NA,the preservation of the control of,44
NA,Executive by the Parliament itself. I believe,44
NA,that there are five principal stages in,44
NA,control over Commonwealth finances. I,44
NA,believe that my fellow members of the,44
NA,House will agree that the first stage is,44
NA,preparation of the Budget and the,44
NA,"Eslimates by departments, and that very",44
NA,close scrutiny which is given to those Esti-,44
NA,"mates by Treasury. This, of course, is a",44
NA,"strong system of control. Secondly, there is",44
NA,the consideration of the Estimates by Par-,44
NA,itself and the subsequent appropria-,44
NA,tion of the necessary funds by Parliament.,44
NA,"Thirdly, there is the execution of the Par-",44
NA,liament's authorisation by the departments,44
NA,which receive the funds. We can see here,44
NA,that there is a control to which I will be,44
NA,referring shortly when I refer to the war-,44
NA,"rant system. Fourthly, there is that all im-",44
NA,portant check by the Auditor-General and,44
NA,his staff. The Auditor-General is a statutory,44
NA,officer who brings his own report direct,44
NA,to Parliament. We can call this the fourth,44
NA,"method of control. Lastly, in the name of",44
NA,the Parliament we have here in Australia,44
NA,Public Accounts Committee which carries,44
NA,out certain examinations according to the,44
NA,availability of time and presents its own,44
NA,to both Houses of the Parliament. 1,44
NA,felt that I ought to indicate that here was,44
NA,Coman inbuilt system of five varying stages,44
NA,which represents a control over the funds.,44
NA,Like much of tbe procedure of the Par-,44
NA,"liament itself, the financial procedures em-",44
NA,bodied in the Audit Act to which 1 am,44
NA,reference have so often an interest-,44
NA,ing history and derive their form actually,44
NA,from the earlier steps taken by the Uniled,44
NA,on Kingdom Government to set up an adequate,44
NA,the scheme of control over the expenditure of,44
NA,the Parliament. It is for this reason thai,44
NA,I in the debate tonight I want to make the,44
NA,point that I believe the Parliament should,44
NA,not permit an alteration to this type of,44
NA,traditional procedure which we find in the,44
NA,Audit Act without careful analysis. Altera-,44
NA,tion surely should only be permitted when,44
NA,the Parliament itself is convinced that cir-,44
NA,cumstances completely justify the change,44
NA,that there is in any amendment that is,44
NA,being approved no derogation of the,44
NA,authority of the Parliament. One of the,44
NA,features of this small Bill which has,44
NA,"referred to by a previous speaker, I",44
NA,"think, as a 'technical Bill', is the change in",44
NA,the procedure concerning the use of the,44
NA,Governor-General's warrant. From my own,44
NA,the inquiries and the limited research I have,44
NA,been able to do 1 still find it possible to,44
NA,summarise the development of this warrant,44
NA,the system and the existing requirements under,44
NA,draft the Act as we know it today.,44
NA,No money may be withdrawn from the,45
NA,Commonwealth public account unless the,45
NA,Auditor-General in advance gives his cer-,45
NA,tificate that the moneys requisitioned by the,45
NA,Treasurer are legally available and applicable,45
NA,for the purposes specified in the warrant.,45
NA,This procedure itself is of traditional im-,45
NA,portance in the British concept of parlia-,45
NA,"mentary control over expenditure, and I find",45
NA,that it was in existence in the United King-,45
NA,dom even before there was an Auditor-,45
NA,General appointed. Prior to the appoint-,45
NA,ment of the Auditor-General in the first,45
NA,"place in 1866, the officer who was respon-",45
NA,sible was known as the 'Comptroller-,45
NA,General'. So we see that this function in,45
NA,connection with the use of a warrant was,45
NA,carried on after the Prime Minister of the,45
NA,"day, Gladstone, felt that there should be not",45
NA,only a check on issues from the public,45
NA,account but also a check on how moneys,45
NA,were being spent. In my opinion it repre-,45
NA,"sents, therefore, a traditional control by",45
NA,"the Parliament over expenditure, and this",45
NA,is of significant importance.,45
NA,I turn to a recent publication entitled,45
NA,'Government Accounting in Australia'. The,45
NA,very first article in this informative book,45
NA,was written some years ago by an esteemed,45
NA,"former member of this House, who was the",45
NA,first Chairman of the Public Accounts Com-,45
NA,mittee when the Committee was reconsti-,45
NA,"tuted in 1951. Of course, I refer to the late",45
NA,Professor Francis Armand Bland. He wrote,45
NA,an article entitled 'Control of Government,45
NA,Expenditure'. I believe that as we look at,45
NA,the Audit Act on this occasion we should,45
NA,not overlook what he said about this history.,45
NA,He said:,45
NA,The long struggle for control which began as,45
NA,far back as the Plantagenets and the Tudors,45
NA,to limit the access of the executive-th e Crown-,45
NA,"to funds, and it has ended in surrendering to",45
NA,another executive-th e Cabinet-al l the powers,45
NA,it withheld from the Monarchs. It is a different,45
NA,"executive, it is true, and it holds office not by",45
NA,divine right but by popular vote; but it is still,45
NA,the executive and it has attained the right to say,45
NA,how much is to be spent and for what purposes.,45
NA,He then set out the highlights in the struggle,45
NA,for control over finance. He summarised,45
NA,them briefly as follows:,45
NA,(1) the insistence by the Commons that they,45
NA,should have the sole right to levy taxation; and,45
NA,(2) that the King should spend the money on,45
NA,the purpose for which it was voted. These things,45
NA,were not achieved until the 1688 Revolution by,45
NA,which time the principle of annual appropriations,45
NA,was adopted. Taxes were levied annually. The next,45
NA,"step was taken in 1834, when Departments had",45
NA,to submit accounts of their expenditure. Gradually,45
NA,"this practice was made general, and in 1861",45
NA,Gladstone set up the Public Accounts Committee,45
NA,to examine the details of that expenditure sub-,45
NA,mitted by the Departments to the Parliament.,45
NA,The audit of the accounts developed indepen-,45
NA,dently. In 178S there were appointed the Com-,45
NA,"missioners for Auditing of the Public Accounts,",45
NA,but these were responsible to the Treasury. By,45
NA,1834 they were made responsible to Parliament.,45
NA,Parliament was forced to become more interested,45
NA,in thc integrity of public ofncials and in the,45
NA,honesty and regularity of public accounting. Thus,45
NA,"came the Exchequer and Audit Act, 1866, which",45
NA,required all Departments to render detailed Appro-,45
NA,priation Accounts to Parliament duly certified,45
NA,by an accounting officer. These accounts had to,45
NA,"be submitted to a new officer, independent of",45
NA,"the Government, called the Comptroller and",45
NA,Auditor-General.,45
NA,Finally on this quote I refer to these words,45
NA,of the late Professor Francis Armand Bland:,45
NA,The Act also provided that the credits for the,45
NA,operations of the Departments made available to.,45
NA,the Treasury were to be issued by the Comptroller,45
NA,and Auditor-General. The Australian practice of,45
NA,obtaining Warrants is similar. The significance of,45
NA,this provision lies in the fact that it embodies the,45
NA,constitutional principle of prior Parliamentary,45
NA,approval over all issues from the Exchequer.,45
NA,There is an appropriate reference to these,45
NA,"warrants, which find a most important place",45
NA,"in this amending Bill, in the 43rd report",45
NA,of this Parliament's own Public Accounts,45
NA,Committee. I simply draw attention to,45
NA,paragraphs 18 and 19 of that report. Foi,45
NA,those honourable members who are interes-,45
NA,"ted, it will be on record for detailed reading.",45
NA,"This Bill, among other things, specifically",45
NA,removes the arbitrary provision of quarterly,45
NA,Governor-General warrants. It is to this,45
NA,point that I wish to speak rather specifically.,45
NA,"I suggest that if, with quarterly warrants,",45
NA,sought the Treasurer has had a form of control,45
NA,over the flow of expenditure within the year,45
NA,and he has had a device whereby he could,45
NA,"curtail that flow in the public interest, one",45
NA,"wonders whether, with the abolition of this",45
NA,"arbitrary quarterly warrant system, he will",45
NA,now seek some other form of control. As,45
NA,"a matter of fact, in earlier thinking about",45
NA,this and in earlier general discussion it was,45
NA,my understanding that there was seen in the,45
NA,quarterly warrant a very valuable control.,45
NA,"I believe, for example, that the use of it",45
NA,had become traditional in the thinking of,45
NA,"public servants, and perhaps of the Com-",45
NA,monwealth Auditor-General and his staff.,45
NA,"Now, if it is to be removed, one wonders",45
NA,whether previous suggestions about another,46
NA,form of control to replace it have,46
NA,been discarded entirely or whether some,46
NA,other device not requiring the approval ot,46
NA,the Parliament is in mind.,46
NA,Mr Dobie-I t has not been mentioned in,46
NA,the Bill.,46
Mr CLEAVER,"No , there is no mention",46
NA,of this in the Bill. J think we can summarise,46
NA,the second reading speech of the Minister,46
NA,for Civil Aviation ( Mr Swartz) by saying,46
NA,that he stated that at present computerised,46
NA,methods provide information very quickly,46
NA,and as frequently as desired to the Trea-,46
NA,sury and to the many other Departments of,46
NA,the Commonwealth administration. I believe,46
NA,the Minister argued in his short speech that,46
NA,since the rate of expenditure can be ob-,46
NA,served much more readily the need to,46
NA,provide a quarterly warrant has virtually,46
NA,disappeared. ]. believe he said that it is,46
NA,therefore proposed to permit warrants to,46
NA,be obtained for the full amount appro-,46
NA,priated. This would be done not at regular,46
NA,frequencies of every 3 months and the,46
NA,warrant would be not merely for the amount,46
NA,expected to be spent in that period of 3,46
NA,"months or less. Therefore, no-one can argue",46
NA,"against the statement that, for the first time",46
NA,in the long years of history under the Audit,46
NA,"Act, we see a very important change. Some",46
NA,may have feared it.,46
NA,"1 want to say, although 1 am underlining",46
NA,in my speech the value of much of the,46
NA,tradition of the Parliament and much of,46
NA,the value of the traditional methods and,46
NA,"procedures regarding appropriations, funds",46
NA,and controls that are written into the Audit,46
NA,"Act, that 1 am one who believes that com-",46
NA,puterisation will have very wide ramifica-,46
NA,tions not only in parliamentary and govern-,46
NA,"ment administration but, of course, in the",46
NA,field of general commerce. I believe we have,46
NA,to be flexible in our thinking and that we,46
NA,should be prepared to face rather drastic,46
NA,changes. Perhaps some of the traditions,46
NA,of Parliament will not be evident in 10 to,46
NA,"15 years time. Perhaps now, under this",46
NA,"Bill, we will see a change along the lines",46
NA,of something that was said to me not so,46
NA,long ago by a very important official in,46
NA,this sphere. He said that he felt alterations,46
NA,"were desirable. Even he, perhaps, has had",46
NA,to alter his mind in face of the facts brought,46
NA,out by the Treasurer and presented to the,46
NA,"House. Actually, on a previous occasion I",46
NA,argued that the specific quarterly warrants,46
NA,could perhaps be wasteful. I pointed out,46
NA,that there was a pressure to issue warrants,46
NA,"quarterly through the Treasury, that these",46
NA,would all have to be checked by the Com-,46
NA,monwealth Auditor-General and that they,46
NA,would all have to be presented to the,46
NA,Governor-General for his approval and,46
NA,signature. I actually raised this point in,46
NA,some remarks that I made: Could the pro-,46
NA,cedure regarding warrants possibly be a bit,46
NA,of the old tradition and in the modern con-,46
NA,text be entirely superfluous? I wondered,46
NA,whether we needed to be strongly convinced,46
NA,regarding its retention.,46
NA,I pointed out that the permanent head,46
NA,of every department carries a very great,46
NA,responsibility for the administration of,46
NA,his department. No-one can really inter-,46
NA,fere with that administrative responsibility,46
NA,and his activities. All of the officers of a,46
NA,"department are subject to detail checking,",46
NA,"if this is desired, by the Commonwealth",46
NA,"Auditor-General. As I have said tonight,",46
NA,the Auditor-General reports to the Parlia-,46
NA,ment on the efficiency of a department,46
NA,regarding the proper usage of funds and,46
NA,the keeping of fund expenditure within,46
NA,warrant. Whilst I may have been a little,46
NA,"controversial in the remarks that I made,",46
NA,any fear that I had about wastage has,46
NA,"been vindicated, for the Minister in his",46
NA,second reading speech made the points,46
NA,about computerisation and that the previous,46
NA,reasons which required quarterly warrants,46
NA,are no longer valid. He pointed out that,46
NA,there is another control under the item,46
NA,heading instead of just the subdivisional,46
NA,heading. He went on to say that now that,46
NA,we have decided to do away with the,46
NA,arbitrary quarterly warrants the savings,46
NA,from these changes under the Bill are,46
NA,"expected to be of the order of $100,000",46
NA,a year. Being a member of the Parlia-,46
NA,mentary Public Accounts Committee I can,46
NA,hardly complain of a saving of that magni-,46
NA,tude in a procedure that many people,46
NA,"thought was highly desirable, but which I",46
NA,personally considered might have been,46
NA,thought desirable simply because it was,46
NA,traditional and because we had become,46
NA,"accustomed to it because there was, of",46
NA,"course, an element of control inherent in",46
NA,it. Here I find that any fears I had that it,46
NA,might have been superfluous work have,46
NA,virtually been substantiated.,46
NA,Apart from the warrant procedure there,47
NA,are other items or amendments in the,47
NA,small Bill. I want to refer to only one,47
NA,matter. Members of the Parliamentary,47
NA,"Public Accounts Committee, when a",47
NA,Treasury minute is reported by the Com-,47
NA,mittee to the Parliament indicating action,47
NA,"that is to be taken, are naturally delighted",47
NA,to see that action eventually taken in the,47
NA,Parliament in the form of an amendment.,47
NA,The amendment I refer to in particular,47
NA,was suggested as a recommendation in the,47
NA,61st report of the Joint Committee of,47
NA,Public Accounts. The Committee in the,47
NA,report noted difficulties arising from the,47
NA,inclusion of deduction and transfer items,47
NA,in the schedules to the various appropria-,47
NA,tion measures. This matter has now been,47
NA,corrected by an amendment in this Bill.,47
NA,"The other items, whilst they are impor-",47
NA,"tant, do not attract my attention on this",47
NA,occasion for comment. J would like to revert,47
NA,to the main point. We have an amendment,47
NA,to the Audit Act. I join forces with my,47
NA,"friend, the honourable member for Mel-",47
NA,"bourne Ports ( Mr Crean), who, during the",47
NA,course of his speech said that the Bill,47
NA,touches only some items. The Minister at,47
NA,the table interjected and said that there,47
NA,"more amendments contemplated. To this,",47
NA,the honourable member for Melbourne,47
NA,"Ports said: 'Yes, but we have been promised",47
NA,a complete review of the Audit Act for,47
NA,"many, many years'. So 1 would add my",47
NA,voice lo an appeal to the Minister for Civil,47
NA,Aviation ( Mr Swartz) who is at Ihe table,47
NA,and who is also the Minister assisting the,47
NA,Treasurer. I make an appeal for a deter-,47
NA,mined drive to review every outstanding,47
NA,amendment which is being proposed to tbe,47
NA,Audit Act. As I said in tbe context of my,47
NA,"opening remarks, you cannot go virtually",47
NA,beyond the Audit Act for these funda-,47
NA,mental principles of control over the Execu-,47
NA,tive. It is through this very legislation that,47
NA,thi.s Parliament exercises a control over all,47
NA,the funds of the Commonwealth. I hope,47
NA,that we will not be dilatory in bringing this,47
NA,"Acl completely up to date. Of course, I am",47
NA,realistic enough io know that as soon as,47
NA,"this is done, in this changing world the need",47
NA,for other amendments will become apparent.,47
NA,"But my fear, and that of the honourable",47
NA,"member for Melbourne Ports, is that there",47
NA,are many amendments which have been,47
NA,in contemplation for too long. I am satisfied,47
NA,that the main change being made by the,47
NA,"Bill, relating to the warrant procedure, has",47
NA,been overdue. I trust that we as a Parlia-,47
NA,ment will observe any other methods of,47
NA,control that may be exercised by the Trea-,47
NA,surer and officers of the Treasury.,47

NA,SCHOLARSHIPS BILL 1969,47
NA,Second Reading,47
NA,Debate resumed from 20 March (vide,47
NA,"page 738), on motion by Mr Malcolm",47
NA,Fraser:,47
NA,That lhe Bill be now read a .second lime.,47
Mr BARNARD ,Bass) [8.20]-Thi s is,47
NA,the first time that legislation of this nature,47
NA,has come before the House. In 1967 a,47
NA,Scholarships Bill was introduced in the,47
NA,Senate by the present Prime Minisler ( Mr,47
NA,"were Gorton), who was then Minisler for",47
NA,Education and Science. The Bill was very,47
NA,severely criticised in the Senate and,47
NA,subsequently withdrawn. After a lengthy,47
NA,period of re-examination and redrafting the,47
NA,Scholarships Bill 1969 has been presented.,47
NA,The Bill was presented on this occasion,47
NA,by the Minister for Education and Science,47
NA,"( Mr Malcolm Fraser), who succeeded the",47
NA,Prime Minister in that portfolio. The,47
NA,initial Bill gave the Minister considerable,47
NA,discretionary powers. It gave him power to,47
NA,determine the number of scholarships,47
NA,"granted, the terms of eligibility for those",47
NA,"seeking scholarships, the way in which they",47
NA,were to be selected and those authorised,47
NA,to grant scholarships. They were very great,47
NA,powers which were in no way circum-,47
NA,scribed by regulations.,47
NA,"At the time, my colleagues in the Senate",47
NA,did not dispute that the Minister needed,47
NA,a certain measure of discretionary power,47
NA,under the Act. The Opposition conceded,47
NA,that there were individual cases in which,47
NA,the Minister would have lo exercise discre-,47
NA,tion so that fair and equitable treatment of,47
NA,all applicants could be assured. But the,47
NA,Opposition disputed the sweeping powers,47
NA,which would have been given to the Mini-,48
NA,ster by the 1967 legislation. It argued,48
NA,that the powers of the Minister should be,48
NA,governed by regulations. It was not the,48
NA,intention of the Opposition to take away,48
NA,all discretionary power from the Minister.,48
NA,It recognised that be should retain enough,48
NA,power to prevent anomalies and abuses.,48
NA,On these principles several clauses of the,48
NA,original Bill were rejected by the Senate.,48
NA,One of the most notable critics of the wide,48
NA,discretionary powers tbat the Bill conferred,48
NA,was the present Minister for Works,48
NA,(Senator Wright). This Bill replaces the,48
NA,1967 legislation. The Opposition believes,48
NA,that most of the objectionable features,48
NA,of the previous legislation have been,48
NA,removed.,48
NA,"Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill refer",48
NA,"to grants of Commonwealth technical,",48
NA,advanced education and university scholar-,48
NA,ships and post-graduate awards. Each clause,48
NA,provides that the appropriate scholarship or,48
NA,award may bc granted by the Minister in,48
NA,accordance with the regulations. 1 emphasise,48
NA,the words 'in accordance with the regula-,48
NA,tions'. 1 understand that it is intended to,48
NA,issue quite extensive regulations covering,48
NA,the administration of the Act and in par-,48
NA,ticular the terms of eligibility of persons,48
NA,for scholarships. This is commendable. It,48
NA,will not limit the discretion of the Minister,48
NA,to deal with the special circumstances wbich,48
NA,"may arise from time to time. Of course, this",48
NA,should have been provided for in the initial,48
NA,legislation. The reassessment of the pro-,48
NA,visions of this legislation has certainly,48
NA,strengthened and improved it.,48
NA,in the main the Opposition will not,48
NA,oppose the provisions of the Bill. The Oppo-,48
NA,sition endorses clauses 1 to 10 of the Bill,48
NA,"without reservation. However, there are",48
NA,some points that the Minister should clarify,48
NA,for the House. If this is done the Opposi-,48
NA,tion will raise no objections to the other,48
NA,clauses at the Committee stage. The first,48
NA,point the Minister sbould clarify is the use,48
NA,of thc word 'prescribed' in clauses 11 and,48
NA,12. 1 ask the Minister to explain whether,48
NA,Ihis means prescribed by the regulations.,48
NA,If that is the intention of the term the,48
NA,Opposition accepts the clauses. But if that,48
NA,is not the inicnfion the Opposition will move,48
NA,to ensure that the clauses clearly state that,48
NA,'prescribed' means prescribed by the,48
NA,regulations.,48
NA,There seems also to be a clear contradic-,48
NA,"tion between clauses 11 and 12, which deal",48
NA,"with secondary scholarships, and clauses 13",48
NA,"and 14, which deal with tertiary scholar-",48
NA,ships. Clause 11 states that the benefits are,48
NA,prescribed. Presumably they are prescribed,48
NA,in accordance with the regulations. As I,48
NA,"said earlier, this should be made quite clear.",48
NA,Clause 12 also uses tbe word 'prescribed',48
NA,and provides that some forms of additional,48
NA,assistance shaJJ be determined by tbe,48
NA,"Minister. However, clauses 13 and 14 state",48
NA,that these benefits shall be determined in,48
NA,accordance with the regulations. On the,48
NA,face of it there appears to be a clear dif-,48
NA,ference in terminology between clauses 11,48
NA,"and 12, which cover secondary scholar-",48
NA,"ships, and clauses 13 and 14, which cover",48
NA,tertiary scholarships. I ask the Minister to,48
NA,explain whether this denotes a difference in,48
NA,the granting of benefits in these scholarship,48
NA,areas. It may be significant that different,48
NA,phraseology is applied to scholarships for,48
NA,secondary education and scholarships for,48
NA,tertiary education. It could indicate prac-,48
NA,tical differences in the awarding of scholar-,48
NA,ships. If any difference is intended in the,48
NA,awarding of benefits the Minister should,48
NA,explain this fully to the House. If that is,48
NA,not intended he should account for thi.s,48
NA,apparent variation in terminology and again,48
NA,clarify it for the House.,48
NA,Clause 18 of the Bill appears to give the,48
NA,Minister full authority to vary decisions,48
NA,made in relation to scholarships under the,48
NA,Act or the regulations. I ask the Minister,48
NA,to assure the House that there will be a,48
NA,final right of appeal to him where a,48
NA,scholarship is rejected or a benefit is varied.,48
NA,This is an example of where the operation,48
NA,of the ministerial discretion which is granted,48
NA,under the Act should operate. In his second,48
NA,reading speech the Minister said that he,48
NA,was impressed by the extent to which even,48
NA,the most carefully drafted regulations could,48
NA,cause injustice and hardship if administered,48
NA,inflexibly. He has quite rightly preserved his,48
NA,discretion to prevent injustice and hardship.,48
NA,The Minister concluded his speech by,48
NA,recognising the need for an adequate,48
NA,framework for the scholarships legislation,48
NA,and the need to provide for regulations in,48
NA,"important sections. In essence, the Minister",48
NA,has considered the merits of the case made,48
NA,by the Senate against the original legislation,48
NA,and he has acted to remove deficiences.,48
NA,I believe that the Minister should be com-,48
NA,mended for this.,48
NA,The Bill is also significant in that it,49
NA,about the formal dissolution of the Com-,49
NA,monwealth Office of Education. Honour-,49
NA,able members on this side of the House,49
NA,view this move with some nostalgia. This,49
NA,agency was established by the Chifley Go-,49
NA,vernment in 1945. For more than 20 years,49
NA,it served as a vehicle for Commonwealth,49
NA,"aid to education. In particular, it made a",49
NA,noteworthy contribution to the administra-,49
NA,tion of the Commonwealth scholarships,49
NA,scheme. The functions of the Office were,49
NA,absorbed into the Education Division of the,49
NA,Prime Minister's Department and ultimately,49
NA,into the Department of Education and,49
NA,Science.,49
NA,The process by which the great powers,49
NA,of the Commonwealth Government have,49
NA,been applied to education is a long and,49
NA,laborious one. These functions are still,49
NA,being applied in an extremely haphazard,49
NA,"way, as the Opposition has repeatedly",49
NA,"pointed out in this House. However, we",49
NA,can hope that the Department of Educa-,49
NA,"tion and Science, which is still at an early",49
NA,"stage of development, will assume increas-",49
NA,ing burdens in the guidance and promotion,49
NA,of education at all levels in Australia. It,49
NA,is regrettable that there is no longer a role,49
NA,for the Commonwealth Office of Educa-,49
NA,"tion. I take this opportunity, on behalf of",49
NA,"the political party which formed it, to",49
NA,formally acknowledge the Office's passing,49
NA,and to pay tribute to its invaluable work.,49
NA,In his second reading speech the Mini-,49
NA,ster gave some account of the scope and,49
NA,nature of the scholarship schemes at,49
NA,present in operation in Australia. This,49
NA,gives honourable members a chance to,49
NA,consider the implications of the Common-,49
NA,"wealth scheme, to assess the future of",49
NA,university finance in Australia and to con-,49
NA,sider the adequacy of the finance schemes,49
NA,for university students. The Minister,49
NA,pointed out that under the five schemes,49
NA,"contained in the Bill some 56,000 students",49
NA,hold Commonwealth scholarships. He said,49
NA,that without further changes spending on,49
NA,the scheme would rise to nearly $35m by,49
NA,1971-72. These figures sound impressive,49
NA,but on close examination grounds for con-,49
NA,cern about the future of the scheme and,49
NA,the burdens which it imposes must be,49
NA,reconsidered. There has been quite a,49
NA,marked erosion in the base of the Combetween,49
NA,monwealth university scholarship since its,49
NA,"brings introduction in 1951. In that year 3,000",49
NA,open entry scholarships were available for,49
NA,"first year university students, and there",49
NA,"were 7,601 enrolments at Australian univer-",49
NA,"sities. In short, scholarships were available",49
NA,"for 40% of new enrolments. In 1960, 3,000",49
NA,scholarships were available for only 29%,49
NA,of new enrolments. Although the number,49
NA,of scholarships available for first year,49
NA,"students was doubled to 6,000 in 1968",49
NA,there were scholarships for only one in,49
NA,four of those who enrolled.,49
NA,This remarkable erosion on the scholar-,49
NA,ship base can be illustrated further by infor-,49
NA,mation supplied by the Minister for Educa-,49
NA,tion and Science in reply to a question by,49
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam).,49
NA,The information is contained in Hansard of,49
NA,25th February of this year at page 111. It,49
NA,shows that in 1952 51% of all applicants,49
NA,"were granted Commonwealth scholarships,",49
NA,ln 1968 18.3% of applicants received,49
NA,scholarships. This is a most alarming,49
NA,"deterioration, despite the provision of sub-",49
NA,"stantially more scholarships. In 1968,",49
NA,"46,527 applications for Commonwealth",49
NA,scholarships were received. Of those appli-,49
NA,"cations, 8,524 accepted scholarships. Many",49
NA,of the unsuccessful applicants would receive,49
NA,university training by way of manpower,49
NA,"schemes, that is, by various sorts of cadet-",49
NA,"ships, by teacher training and similar",49
NA,schemes. On the evidence of the Committee,49
NA,on the Future of Tertiary Education in Aus-,49
NA,"tralia, known as the 'Martin Committee', the",49
NA,numbers receiving such assistance would be,49
NA,about the same as those receiving assistance,49
NA,by way of Commonwealth scholarships. If,49
NA,we include those students whose families can,49
NA,afford to pay their fees or who obtain,49
NA,"financial assistance to pay the fees, the best",49
NA,assessment that can be made is that only,49
NA,half of those young people wanting uni-,49
NA,versity education are covered by the exist-,49
NA,ing system of student assistance. Even,49
NA,allowing for the hiving off of a substantial,49
NA,number of students into colleges of,49
NA,"advanced education, quite clearly many",49
NA,able students are lost to tertiary education,49
NA,each year. This is a drain of talent which,49
NA,cannot be afforded.,49
NA,The Commonwealth scholarship scheme,49
NA,has made an immense contribution to Aus-,49
NA,"tralia. It produced some 30,000 graduates",49
NA,"1952 and 1966, but on the present",49
NA,basis it is far from adequate. This raises the,49
NA,question of whether the scholarship scheme,50
NA,can be expanded and supplemented by other,50
NA,forms of assistance. There has always been,50
NA,a very strong case for fixing the number of,50
NA,scholarships at a certain percentage of new,50
NA,enrolments each year. This has been recom-,50
NA,mended by the Martin Committee and by,50
NA,the National Union of Australian University,50
NA,Students. In the past there has been too,50
NA,much emphasis on the aggregate of scholar-,50
NA,ships available and not on the number of,50
NA,new enrolments. This meant that over a,50
NA,period of 10 years the number of scholar-,50
NA,ships provided was fixed while enrolments,50
NA,increased rapidly. If the number of scholar-,50
NA,ships was fixed at 40% of new enrolments,50
NA,-th e figure which applied when the scheme,50
NA,"was introduced in 1951-10,00 0 scholar-",50
NA,ships should have been made available last,50
NA,year and not 6.000. I feel that the number,50
NA,of scholarships should be fixed at a higher,50
NA,level; certainly at 50% of the enrolments at,50
NA,least. The value of scholarships also should,50
NA,be tied to the cost of Hving index. Existing,50
NA,benefits have fallen far below living costs.,50
NA,In the broader context there has been much,50
NA,debate in recent years over the financing,50
NA,of university education. Last year the,50
NA,Leader of the Opposition said that the,50
NA,spending of a further $ 10m of public money,50
NA,would provide free university education in,50
NA,Australia. This was hotly disputed by the,50
NA,Minister for Education and Science who,50
NA,said that education at the university level,50
NA,should not be free. He said that most of,50
NA,the taxes which supported universities came,50
NA,from general revenue; that these taxes,50
NA,should not be used for the education of,50
NA,students wbo would become very high in-,50
NA,come earners because of that education.,50
NA,"Unfortunately, the Minister did not follow",50
NA,through the implications of those remarks.,50
NA,The Minister did not say that fees form a,50
NA,negligible percentage of the financing of,50
NA,universities today.,50
NA,In the past 20 years revenue from tuition,50
NA,fees and private endowments have declined,50
NA,sharply. Every university student is already,50
NA,being handsomely subsidised by the taxpayer,50
NA,even if he is on a scholarship or even if he,50
NA,is paying fees. It is unfortunate that the,50
NA,Minister should have seized on a mere,50
NA,SlOm as the burden borne by unfortunate,50
NA,taxpayers whose income cannot be raised,50
NA,by university education. At the moment,50
NA,the financial elite will go to universities,50
NA,because they can pay the fees; the intellec-,50
NA,tual elite will go to universities through,50
NA,"scholarships. However, there remains a very",50
NA,large number of potential students who can-,50
NA,not afford the fees and cannot win a place,50
NA,because there are not enough scholarships.,50
NA,It is unfortunately true that a high propor-,50
NA,tion of scholarships are won by students,50
NA,from economically more privileged groups.,50
NA,In these circumstances it is incorrect to,50
NA,argue that the incidence of making tuition,50
NA,free would fall harshly on the less privileged.,50
NA,The burden of taxation subsidies to univer-,50
NA,sities already falls heavily on these groups.,50
NA,One solution is a substantia] expansion of,50
NA,scholarships. Another is the provision of,50
NA,far greater credit facilities for students who,50
NA,cannot win scholarships but who have the,50
NA,capacity to benefit from university education.,50
NA,The question of loans to students has,50
NA,always been a vexed one. It was rejected,50
NA,by the Robbins Committee on Higher,50
NA,"Education in the United Kingdom, although",50
NA,the Committee did recommend that some,50
NA,experimentation with this sort of financing,50
NA,might be necessary. The concept of loans,50
NA,to students was also rejected by the Martin,50
NA,Committee. 1 feel that this attitude should,50
NA,be reconsidered with a view to providing,50
NA,credit facilities for students on a national,50
NA,basis. Credit facilities are provided to,50
NA,cover the whole range of tangible goods,50
NA,and services in the economy. It has been,50
NA,suggested that credit should not be provided,50
NA,for intangibles such as health and education.,50
NA,"However, contributions to health funds and",50
NA,insurance funds are in a sense credit,50
NA,arrangements.,50
NA,In these circumstances I feel that a Com-,50
NA,monwealth corporation to provide credit for,50
NA,students seeking it could be established.,50
NA,Such a corporation could provide low,50
NA,interest loans for tuition fees and such loans,50
NA,could be repayable from the future earnings,50
NA,of the recipients. It could underwrite loans,50
NA,made privately to university students. It,50
NA,could also be used to supplement a a,50
NA,expanded scholarship scheme. Such a cor-,50
NA,poration could make loans repayable at 1%,50
NA,interest during student years and 2% there-,50
NA,"after. Alternatively, it could subsidise tuition",50
NA,fees by the formation of a revolving fund,50
NA,that would be replenished by repayments. In,50
NA,association with an expanded scholarship,50
NA,"scheme, it would replace the existing com-",51
NA,plex and unsatisfactory structure. An exten-,51
NA,"sive loan scheme, allied to a wider scholar-",51
NA,"ship scheme, would mean that everyone",51
NA,entitled to a university education would,51
NA,have his fees paid and would receive a,51
NA,living allowance during his education. Such,51
NA,a revision of the existing system is needed,51
NA,if a further erosion of the Commonwealth,51
NA,scholarship base and a further wastage of,51
NA,potential talent are to be avoided.,51
NA,I have clearly indicated to this House,51
NA,how the number of scholarships as a per-,51
NA,centage of the number of applicants has,51
NA,fallen in recent years. No doubt the Minister,51
NA,for Education and Science and Government,51
NA,"members may be able to argue, and suc-",51
NA,"cessfully argue, that some years ago the per-",51
NA,centage of those students who were suc-,51
NA,cessful in obtaining Commonwealth assis-,51
NA,tance under the Commonwealth scholarship,51
NA,scheme was at a satisfactory level-althoug h,51
NA,it has never reached the level that the Aus-,51
NA,tralian Labor Party has been advocating in,51
NA,recent years. But there has been a steady,51
NA,deterioration in tbe percentage of those,51
NA,who successfully apply for scholarships,51
NA,under the existing scheme. We have argued,51
NA,"consistently, as was pointed out by the",51
NA,"Leader of the Opposition some time ago,",51
NA,that university education should be entirely,51
NA,free. 1 think that is a valid point.,51
NA,The wastage of talent at the secondary,51
NA,school level is far more than this country,51
NA,can afford. Any country that refuses to,51
NA,acknowledge the importance of education,51
NA,and that is prepared to accept the per-,51
NA,centage of wastage to which I have just,51
NA,referred will find itself inevitably in extreme,51
NA,difficulties in the years that lie ahead. The,51
NA,Martin Committee has made a number of,51
NA,very valuable suggestions on what should,51
NA,be the approach of an enlightened Govern-,51
NA,ment not only on the question of Common-,51
NA,wealth scholarships but also on the question,51
NA,of tertiary education generally. The Minis-,51
NA,ter for Education and Science took the,51
NA,opportunity to criticise the suggestion that,51
NA,had been made by the Leader of the,51
NA,Opposition that tertiary education in this,51
NA,"country should be entirely free, and he dis-",51
NA,puted the statement by the Leader of the,51
NA,Opposition that it would involve taxpayers,51
NA,in an additional expense of about SlOm,51
NA,annually. The Minister for Education and,51
NA,"Science, as I have already indicated to the",51
NA,"House, did not point out that all university",51
NA,"students are today being highly subsidised,",51
NA,whether they are receiving a Common-,51
NA,wealth scholarship or not. As a result of,51
NA,the recommendations initially made by the,51
NA,"Murray Committee, which was set up by",51
NA,"this Government, and the subsequent",51
NA,"recommendations of the Martin Committee,",51
NA,the Government has accepted a measure of,51
NA,responsibility in education at this level. As,51
NA,a result of the Government's decision,51
NA,university education has been heavily,51
NA,subsidised.,51
NA,We believe that university education,51
NA,ought to be the responsibility of the Com-,51
NA,monwealth Government. If the Common-,51
NA,wealth were prepared to accept full,51
NA,"responsibility for education at this level, it",51
NA,would undoubtedly make additional finance,51
NA,available to State Education Departments,51
NA,"for education at the primary, secondary and",51
NA,"technical levels. Therefore, I want to point",51
NA,out once again that the policy enunciated,51
NA,by the Leader of the Opposition on the,51
NA,question of tertiary education is one that,51
NA,will be implemented by a future Labor,51
NA,Government. University education should,51
NA,be free. No Government can condone the,51
NA,present deterioration in the facilities made,51
NA,available to those who want to undertake,51
NA,education at the tertiary level. The wastage,51
NA,at the secondary school level is far greater,51
NA,than this country can afford.,51
NA,ln addition to pointing out what we,51
NA,believe ought to be the Government's,51
NA,approach to the question of Commonwealth,51
NA,scholarships and other scholarships that will,51
NA,"be available under this legislation, I have",51
NA,indicated that the Government should con-,51
NA,sider granting loans to university students,51
NA,to enable them to complete a course at a,51
NA,university. I want to reiterate that those,51
NA,who belong to affluent families are in a,51
NA,position to undertake a university course of,51
NA,education. If they are gifted intellectually,51
NA,they can win Commonwealth scholarships.,51
NA,Those who do not belong to affluent,51
NA,families and whose parents cannot pay for,51
NA,their university education and who cannot,51
NA,qualify for a Commonwealth scholarship,51
NA,under the present scheme are the students,51
NA,who concern members on this side of the,51
NA,House. The Government must face up to,51
NA,its responsibilities on tbe loss of oppor-,51
NA,tunities and the wastage of talent at this,51
NA,level.,51
NA,"Having made those points, I would like",52
NA,to say in summary that the Opposition does,52
NA,not oppose this Bill. It welcomes the very,52
NA,substantial modifications to the legislation,52
NA,outlined by the Minister for Education and,52
NA,Science. 1 have tried to draw attention to,52
NA,the deterioration of the present scholarship,52
NA,scheme and the need for rehabilitating and,52
NA,supplementing it. Unfortunately the Minis-,52
NA,ter for Education and Science is not in the,52
NA,"House tonight, but I hope that when he",52
NA,reads the points that have been made by,52
NA,myself in resuming this debate on behalf,52
NA,of the Opposition and the points that will,52
NA,be made by my colleagues who will follow,52
NA,me in this debate he will incorporate these,52
NA,suggestions in lhe Bill. If it is not possible,52
NA,to incorporate these provisions now I hope,52
NA,the Government will give serious considera-,52
NA,tion to amending the legislation as soon as,52
NA,possible.,52
Mr ARTHUR ,Barton) [8.50]- I rise to,52
NA,support the Scholarships Bill 1969 for our industrial life.,52
NA,several reasons. Before stating those reasons,52
NA,may I say that Ibe attitude of the Aus-,52
NA,tralian Labor Party to education has always,52
NA,amazed me. Honourable members on the,52
NA,"Opposition side are great theoreticians,",52
NA,their main forte is in trying to cast suspicion,52
NA,on the aims and integrity of the Governthe,52
NA,"ment in this field. I can understand this,",52
NA,because the record of the Labor Party in,52
NA,thc field of education is so lamentable that,52
NA,the Parly tries to hide its inadequacy by,52
NA,making wild promises and vaguely veiled,52
NA,aspersions. I often wonder whether it is,52
NA,really interested in education or only,52
NA,gaining votes at the next election. It must,52
NA,be rather frustrating for members of the,52
NA,Labor Party to view the great strides,52
NA,Government has made in tbe past decade.,52
NA,Let us face the fact that the performance,52
NA,of the Labor Party in the field of educaof,52
NA,"tion has been a poor one, and the speech",52
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr,52
NA,Barnard) made tonight will do nothing to,52
NA,change ihis. I often wonder why the Oppobodies,52
NA,sition still carries on with its,52
NA,attempt to keep alive in Australia the,52
NA,phoney class attitude that permeates almost,52
NA,every phase of its political philosophy. That,52
NA,attitude was perpetuated tonight in,52
NA,speech of the Deputy Leader of the Oppodebate,52
NA,"sition, and it is just as phoney today as",52
NA,was when the Opposition adopted it a am,52
NA,"decade ago. This type of snobbery, inverted",52
NA,though it may be. does little justice to Ihe,52
NA,young people of today who care nothing,52
NA,for the time worn cliches of three decades,52
NA,"ago, and who have completely rejected the",52
NA,emotional appeals to class hatred that the,52
NA,Opposition is consistently making in this,52
NA,House. The Opposition should recognise,52
NA,that we are at the end of tbe 1960s and,52
NA,not in the depression of the 1930s.,52
NA,Another thing that amazed me about the,52
NA,speech of the Deputy Leader of the Oppo-,52
NA,sition was that he spent most of his time,52
NA,extolling the virtues of having a university,52
NA,education and uttered not a word about the,52
NA,education of those who wished to become,52
NA,tradesmen or technicians. For a Party which,52
NA,professes to have an interest in the working,52
NA,man and his family it is astonishing that,52
NA,he did not even mention the thousands of,52
NA,splendid young men and women who every,52
NA,year train to become tradesmen or tech-,52
NA,nicians. These people are the backbone of,52
NA,The first reason why 1 support this Bill,52
NA,is that I have great respect for the vast,52
NA,strides in education this Government has,52
NA,but made possible in the last decade. One does,52
NA,not need to have a long memory to recall,52
NA,days when it was considered to be quite,52
NA,improper for the Federal Government to,52
NA,take any part in the development of educa-,52
NA,tional facilities in Australia. Education was,52
NA,"regarded strictly as a State function, and",52
NA,attempts by the Federal Government to,52
NA,assist the States with specific projects were,52
NA,in looked upon with great suspicion. This,52
NA,"Government, under successive Ministers for",52
NA,"Education and Science, first the then Sena-",52
NA,this tor John Gorton and now the Honourable,52
NA,Malcolm Fraser. has initiated moves vastly,52
NA,to improve the facilities for and the quality,52
NA,education in Australia. Most of the,52
NA,advances made by the Government were,52
NA,"new and imaginative, but almost invariably",52
NA,they were met with hostility by the Oppo-,52
NA,sition in this Parliament and by the outside,52
NA,which control the Labor Party and,52
NA,extraordinary dictate its policies.,52
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! I remind the,52
NA,the honourable member for Barton that the,52
NA,on the Scholarships Bill does not,52
NA,it range over the whole field of education. I,52
NA,finding it a little difficult to see the,52
NA,relevance of these remarks to this Bill.,52
Mr ARTHUR, J hope that I can remedy,53
NA,that. J think it may be of interest to honourstudents,53
NA,able members to have a look at the types,53
NA,of scholarship schemes in operation at the,53
NA,moment because not everyone realises what,53
NA,is being done by tbis Government in the,53
NA,field of education. The first one is the,53
NA,monwealth postgraduate awards scheme,53
NA,which has been in existence since 1959 and,53
NA,was introduced by the Liberal Government,53
NA,after it considered the Murray report on,53
NA,Australian universities. The scheme provides,53
NA,assistance for well qualified graduates for,53
NA,an approved programme of postgraduate,53
NA,"studies, usually leading to either a master's",53
NA,degree or a doctorate at an Australian uni-,53
NA,versity. The benefits payable under this,53
NA,"scheme comprise a stipend of $2,350 per",53
NA,"annum, an annual contribution of $400 to",53
NA,"go towards research costs for each student,",53
NA,and other allowances.,53
NA,The second scheme is the Commonwealth,53
NA,university scholarship scheme. This scheme,53
NA,was commenced in 1951 by tbe Liberal,53
NA,Government as the Commonwealth scholar-,53
NA,ship scheme when awards were offered for,53
NA,first degree and diploma courses at univer-,53
NA,sities and tertiary courses at other approved,53
NA,institutions such as technical colleges. In,53
NA,1966 the Commonwealth scholarship,53
NA,"scheme was replaced by two schemes, the",53
NA,Commonwealth university scholarship,53
NA,scheme and the Commonwealth advanced,53
NA,education scholarship scheme.,53
NA,The Commonwealth university scholarship,53
NA,scheme provides awards for full-time and,53
NA,part-time study in first degree and diploma,53
NA,courses at Australian universities. Pre-,53
NA,viously the detailed administration of these,53
NA,awards was carried out by the State Educa-,53
NA,tion Departments. It was decided that the,53
NA,Commonwealth should take over this func-,53
NA,"tion, starting at the beginning of 1968. There",53
NA,are three types of scholarships-ope n,53
NA,"entrance scholarships for matriculation,",53
NA,later year scholarships for students who,53
NA,"have completed some university studies, and",53
NA,mature age scholarships for students who,53
NA,have turned 25 years of age.,53
NA,Benefits paid by the Liberal Government,53
NA,include the payment of all compulsory fees,53
NA,for all award holders without means test. A,53
NA,living allowance is also payable subject to,53
NA,a means test. Maximum living allowance,53
NA,rales in 1969 are $559 per annum for,53
NA,living at home and $904.80 per,53
NA,annum for students Hving away from home.,53
NA,Then we bave the Commonwealth,53
NA,advanced education scholarships which were,53
NA,provided by this Government under a,53
NA,Com- separate scheme from the beginning of,53
NA,"1966, assistance for similar courses being",53
NA,previously available under the old Com-,53
NA,monwealth scholarship scheme. Awards are,53
NA,given by this Government for full-time and,53
NA,part-time study in diploma and other,53
NA,approved tertiary courses at technical col-,53
NA,leges and similar institutions. There are two,53
NA,kinds of scholarships-ope n entrance,53
NA,scholarships for students at matriculation,53
NA,"standard, and later year scholarships for",53
NA,students who have completed part of an,53
NA,approved course. Benefits are the same as,53
NA,those paid under the university scholarship,53
NA,scheme.,53
NA,The fourth scheme is Commonwealth,53
NA,secondary scholarships scheme. The first,53
NA,secondary scholarships were taken up in,53
NA,1965. Awards are given for the final 2,53
NA,years of secondary schooling. Benefits avail-,53
NA,able to a secondary scholarship holder,53
NA,"include a living allowance of $200 per year,",53
NA,a text book and equipment allowance of,53
NA,"$50 per year, and up to $150 per year for",53
NA,"compulsory tuition fees, examination fees",53
NA,and service fees on production of receipts.,53
NA,The last one is the Commonwealth tech-,53
NA,nical scholarships scheme. The first tech-,53
NA,nical scholarships were taken up in 1965,53
NA,by this Governnient. Awards are given,53
NA,mainly for certificate level courses at tech-,53
NA,nical institutions. Benefits available to a full-,53
NA,time technical scholarship holder are: a,53
NA,"living allowance of $200 per year, a text-",53
NA,book and equipment allowance of $50 per,53
NA,"year, and up to $150 per year for com-",53
NA,"pulsory tuition fees, examination fees and",53
NA,service fees on production of receipts. A,53
NA,technical scholarship holder taking a course,53
NA,part-time receives an allowance of $100 per,53
NA,year and reimbursement of compulsory fees,53
NA,up to $100 per year.,53
NA,I want to emphasise that all these,53
NA,schemes were introduced by this Liberal,53
NA,Government and that all these payments,53
NA,were made by the Government. These were,53
NA,completely new advances in the field of,53
NA,education. In order to have some perspec-,53
NA,tive in this matter I would like to draw,53
NA,the attention of the House to the number,53
NA,of awards given under each heading in,54
NA,1969. The number for ihe Commonwealth,54
NA,postgraduate awards is 650; Commonwealth,54
NA,"university scholarships, 9,500; Common-",54
NA,monwealth advanced education scholar-,54
NA,"ships. 1,500; Commonwealth secondary",54
NA,"scholarships, 10,000; and Commonwealth",54
NA,"technical scholarships, 2,500. This gives an",54
NA,overall total of 24.150 for the year 1969.,54
NA,The number of scholarship holders in train-,54
NA,ing in 1969-thi s includes people who are,54
NA,undertaking the second and third year of,54
NA,"their course-i s estimated to be 56,500,",54
NA,which is a far cry from the total of only,54
NA,"6,444 in 1951, just after the Labor Govern-",54
NA,ment went out of office. The appropriations,54
NA,to finance these scholarships for the year,54
NA,"1968-69 totalled 828.880,000 compared",54
NA,with S632.194 in 1950-51. I mention these,54
NA,figures because the Opposition in this,54
NA,Parliament talks as though it had made,54
NA,great strides in the field of education when,54
NA,"it was last in power. The reverse is true,",54
NA,however. The AustraUan Labor Parly has,54
NA,done little about education except talk about,54
NA,it and it was left to Liberal-Country Party,54
NA,governments to get down to work,54
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! There is far too,54
NA,much conversation on my lefi.,54
Mr ARTHUR, I can understand that.,54
NA,This cannot be palatable to the Opposition.,54
NA,It was left to the Liberal-Country Party,54
NA,governments to introduce the forward-,54
NA,looking policies of the past decade.,54
Mr WHITLAM ,"H e reads so badlv, Mr",54
NA,Speaker.,54
Mr ARTHUR, I hear mutterings from,54
NA,the Opposition benches and particularly,54
NA,from the Leader of the Opposition to the,54
NA,effect that the Labor Party has not been in,54
NA,"power in the past rwo decades, so it cannot",54
NA,"be blamed. This is true, despite the fact",54
NA,that it has tried at election after election,54
NA,to buy votes of the Australian people by,54
NA,offering fantastic measures that it knew,54
NA,could not be carried out by any responsible,54
NA,governmeni and that it knew it would never,54
NA,have the responsibility to carry out. It,54
NA,"true that the Labor Party, due to the sound",54
NA,"common sense of the Australian voter, has",54
NA,not been in power in the federal sphere,54
NA,"for 20 years, but it was in power in New",54
NA,South Wales for several decades and it,54
NA,the education system deteriorate to such,54
NA,an extent,54
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! I would again,54
NA,remind the honourable member for Barton,54
NA,that his remarks are very wide of the con-,54
NA,tents of the Bill. 1 can see in the last few,54
NA,statements no real relevance to the Bill.,54
Mr ARTHUR," I apologise, Mr Speaker",54
NA,I thought that they were most apposite.,54
NA,I hope I may be able to finish that sentence.,54
NA,When the Labor Party was in power in,54
NA,New South Wales it let the education system,54
NA,deteriorate to such an extent,54
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! If the honour-,54
NA,able member persists in abusing the forms,54
NA,of the House 1 shall have to deal with him.,54
Mr ARTHUR, I certainly do not per-,54
NA,sist. I am sorry if I was transgressing. I,54
NA,thought I could finish my sentence. Let,54
NA,me say that this Bill brings up to date the,54
NA,requirements needed for such a vast scheme,54
NA,"to operate effectively, while at the same",54
NA,time it gives full protection to those who,54
NA,"come under its various, wide-ranging rami-",54
NA,"fications. It also, 1 am pleased to note,",54
NA,emphasises the need to preserve ministerial,54
NA,discretion. Those of us who deal constantly,54
NA,with a wide range of educational problems,54
NA,"for our constituents, as 1 do in Barton, know",54
NA,how many apparent anomalies crop up in,54
NA,such a vast scheme as this. While we may,54
NA,not always agree with the decisions of the,54
NA,"Minister when he exercises his discretion,",54
NA,we know that these decisions are the result,54
NA,of long and searching research into each,54
NA,"individual case and that the Minister is, to",54
NA,"use a well worn Australianism, completely",54
NA,fair dinkum in both his approach and his,54
NA,outlook. We know that under his wise and,54
NA,imaginative administration we will have new,54
NA,and improved assistance given to both State,54
NA,and independent schools in Australia in the,54
NA,years ahead. I commend this Bill.,54
Mr WHITLAM ,Werriwa-Leader of,54
NA,the Opposition) [9.3]-Australian s increas-,54
NA,ingly recognise that their Federal Govern-,54
NA,ment must treat education as a national,54
NA,is problem and a national challenge. They,54
NA,recognise that a nation's children can enjoy,54
NA,equal opportunities for the development of,54
NA,their talents only if its education system is,54
NA,financed and planned on a national basis.,54
NA,let They recognise that education is the key,54
NA,"to national development, national prosperity",54
NA,and national survival. Successive Liberal,54
NA,governments and successive Liberal Minis-,55
NA,"ters responsible for education have, as a",55
NA,"matter of policy, minimised the role of the",55
NA,Commonwealth in education. They have,55
NA,resisted the development of new Common-,55
NA,wealth initiatives in educational matters.,55
NA,Liberals are as anxious to slow down the,55
NA,inevitable increase in government expendi-,55
NA,ture on schools as they are to slow down,55
NA,expenditure on hospitals and urban services.,55
NA,"Accordingly, both State and Federal",55
NA,"Liberals assert that schools, hospitals and",55
NA,urban services are State functions. They,55
NA,know that the best way to restrict govern-,55
NA,ment expenditure on any activity is to say,55
NA,that the particular activity is one for the,55
NA,"States, which have fewer financial resources",55
NA,"than the Commonwealth, and which raise",55
NA,tbeir revenue by indirect rather than direct,55
NA,"taxation, by regressive rather than by pro-",55
NA,"gressive taxation. Again, Liberals seek con-",55
NA,stantly to dampen public interest in educa-,55
NA,tion and to lower the temperature of public,55
NA,debate by insisting that there is no crisis,55
NA,education and by resisting demands for any,55
NA,national inquiry into education. State,55
NA,inquiries into education such as the inquiry,55
NA,recently commenced by the Government of,55
NA,South Australia are no substitute for a com-,55
NA,prehensive investigation at the national,55
NA,level.,55
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns- I take a point of,55
NA,"order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Are these",55
NA,matters appropriate to the Commonwealth,55
NA,"Scholarships Bill, in view of tbe ruling given",55
NA,in relation to the remarks of the last,55
NA,speaker?,55
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock),55
NA,-Tber e is no substance in the point of,55
NA,order.,55
Mr WHITLAM,I t would be possible,55
NA,for every State government to conduct an,55
NA,inquiry into its own education system,55
NA,without establishing the national needs and,55
NA,national priorities around which national,55
NA,expenditure may be organised with greatest,55
NA,"advantage, and for which public support",55
NA,"would be most extensive. Moreover,",55
NA,Liberals use scholarships as a device to,55
NA,defer free education for all by paying the,55
NA,fees of a minority. Commonwealth scholarwere,55
NA,ships mask the failure of our national,55
NA,government to follow comparable national,55
NA,governments into sharing the provision of,55
NA,education without charge. Commonwealth,55
NA,Secondary Scholarships are a typical,55
NA,example of the way in which Liberals defer,55
NA,pressing educational reforms by buying off,55
NA,potentially critical minorities within the,55
NA,electorate. They exemplify this Govern-,55
NA,1,55
NA,ment's cynical disregard for social priori-,55
NA,ties. Secondary Scholarships are awarded,55
NA,on the basis of intellectual tests and not,55
NA,"nnancial need. Inevitably, therefore, they",55
NA,favour students who have benefited from,55
NA,"social and economic advantages, not least",55
NA,among them access to superior schooling.,55
NA,"Inevitably, a high proportion of the funds",55
NA,which are provided go to parents who are,55
NA,well able to afford to keep their children,55
NA,at school. A questionnaire sent to members,55
NA,of the Victorian Association of Head-,55
NA,masters in 1964 elicited the information,55
NA,that of 2151 Secondary Scholarship winners,55
NA,only 24 would have left school if they had,55
NA,not been awarded a scholarship. The,55
NA,headmasters pointed out that there was no,55
NA,way of knowing how many of the children,55
NA,in who in fact left school would have been,55
NA,able to remain if they had received,55
NA,appropriate assistance. It is highly unlikely,55
NA,that the Secondary Scholarship scheme has,55
NA,significantly increased the number of young,55
NA,Australians who are able to complete a,55
NA,"secondary education. Instead, the system",55
NA,has enhanced the situation described by the,55
NA,Director of Secondary Education in Vic-,55
NA,"toria, Mr R. A. Reed, on 3rd September",55
NA,1968. He said:,55
NA,"Compared with secondary schools, the cele-",55
NA,brated rat race of industry and commerce is,55
NA,like a picnic forfieldmice.Education is the only,55
NA,human enterprise based on a confident anticipa-,55
NA,tion of failure. We not only accept failure as,55
NA,"inevitable, we actually build it into the system.",55
NA,Liberals are unable to see that at this stage,55
NA,of Australia's development it may be worth,55
NA,devoting a signincant part of our resources,55
NA,to developing the capacities of all our,55
NA,citizens. They cannot understand that there,55
NA,is no way of accurately sorting out human,55
NA,"beings, and that attempts to do so in",55
NA,secondary schools invariably cost the,55
NA,nation some of its finest intellects and most,55
NA,useful graduates.,55
NA,Twenty-four thousand young Australians,55
NA,admitted to universities in 1968 but,55
NA,"only 6,000 were able to secure Common-",55
NA,wealth scholarships. The total enrolment,55
NA,"of Australian universities rose to 102,000,",55
NA,"of whom only 25,000 were Commonwealth",55
NA,scholars. The Secretary of the Social,56
NA,Science Research Council of Australia,56
NA,commented:,56
NA,It seems to me impossible to argue that barely,56
NA,more than a quarter of the new students entering,56
NA,degree courses in our universities are worth a,56
NA,scholarship. At least one half should qualify for,56
NA,such an award.,56
NA,The leader writer of the 'Australian',56
NA,pointed out:,56
NA,Penalisation of a substantial proportion of,56
NA,"annual matriculants, otherwise well qualified, by",56
NA,the government's failure to offer financial,56
NA,tance is inexcusable.,56
NA,The number of Commonwealth scholar-,56
NA,ships available to university entrants has in,56
NA,"fact declined from 40% in 1951, when the",56
NA,"postwar scheme was launched, to 25% in",56
NA,"1968. The additional 1,500 scholarships",56
NA,foreshadowed in the 1968 Budget will not,56
NA,"even restore the 1951 situation, far less",56
NA,improve it. Nor will the situation be im-,56
NA,proved by the Minister for Education and,56
NA,"Science ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) arguing, as",56
NA,he did in the 'Australian' on 20th May,56
NA,"1968, that:",56
NA,When Commonwealth assistance to students,56
NA,being considered it is important to survey the,56
NA,whole field and not just one particular aspect,56
NA,assistance.,56
NA,University students who now enjoy not,56
NA,much more than half as good a chance of,56
NA,obtaining a scholarship as they did in 1951,56
NA,are no better off for knowing that scholara,56
NA,ships are available elsewhere for education,56
NA,of a different kind. The loss the nation,56
NA,sustains when talented people are unable,56
NA,to undertake university studies for want,56
NA,financial assistance is not reduced because,56
NA,scholarships are now available at colleges,56
NA,"of advanced education. The Minister, moreResearch.",56
NA,"over, should be in no doubt about the",56
NA,status to which colleges of advanced educa-,56
NA,tion have been reduced by the policies of,56
NA,his Government. The essential features,56
NA,these colleges set out in the report of the,56
NA,Martin Committee have now largely disthe,56
NA,"appeared. In particular, the Martin",56
NA,mittee's insistence that they should acquire,56
NA,status equivalent to that of universities has,56
NA,been explicitly abandoned.,56
NA,The public no longer believes and the,56
NA,Government no longer troubles to,56
NA,that colleges of advanced education are anyTeacher,56
NA,"thing other than also-rans, providing",56
NA,limited tertiary education at bargain prices.,56
NA,The Minister himself is so little concerned,56
NA,with the colleges that he has so far been,56
NA,unable to tell me for how many students,56
NA,they cater. The Government is so little con-,56
NA,cerned that it provides for the colleges only,56
NA,one-fifth the number of scholarships which,56
NA,"it provides for universities. Even so, the",56
NA,pent-up demand for a tertiary education is,56
NA,so great that the colleges are already falling,56
NA,a prey to many of the difficulties which,56
NA,beset the universities. Quotas have already,56
NA,been imposed for a number of courses in,56
NA,"assisNew South Wales, Victoria, South Aus-",56
NA,tralia and Western Australia. They will,56
NA,become much more widespread if the Wark,56
NA,Committee succumbs to pressure from,56
NA,State governments and recommends grants,56
NA,for the new triennium which are unrealisti-,56
NA,cally low. Restricted entry applies also,56
NA,throughout the nation's teacher training col-,56
NA,leges. Although the number of Higher Cer-,56
NA,tificate examination candidates in New South,56
NA,Wales increased between 1967 and 1968 by,56
NA,"5,000, only 200 additional places were pro-",56
NA,"vided in teachers colleges, and at least J .500",56
NA,eligible applicants were refused studentships.,56
NA,The Martin Committee recognised that any,56
NA,is serious plan for tertiary education in Aus-,56
NA,of tralia must include teacher training. By,56
NA,refusing to accept responsibility for teacher,56
NA,"training in any form, Sir Robert Menzies",56
NA,abandoned at a stroke the possibility of an,56
NA,integrated tertiary system. He abandoned,56
NA,unique opportunity to improve the quality,56
NA,of Australian schools. He abandoned a most,56
NA,relevant method of helping the struggling,56
NA,State authorities cope with their education,56
NA,of crises. The present Prime Minister ( Mr,56
NA,Gorton) was then Minister-in-charge of,56
NA,Commonwealth Activities in Education and,56
NA,While Sir Robert Menzies on 24th March,56
NA,1965 was extracting the heart from the,56
NA,of Martin proposals in the House of Represen-,56
NA,"tatives, Senator Gorton was extracting it in",56
NA,other place. He said in his ministerial,56
NA,Comstatement on the report that:,56
NA,"Therefore, while we do not in the least deni-",56
NA,grate the importance of the Committee's recom-,56
NA,"mendation in this field, we believe that it is one",56
NA,"where action can be, and should be, left to the",56
NA,State governments who have before them the,56
NA,Committee's recommendations for adoption and,56
NA,pretend action should they so decide.,56
NA,education is the only tertiary field,56
NA,a in which the Commonwealth refuses to,56
NA,become involved. Is the Prime Minister,56
NA,aware of the acute shortage of teachers,56
NA,which is currently embarrassing each and,57
NA,every one of the State governments? Is he,57
NA,aware of the harm which is being inflicted,57
NA,educationally upon yet another generation,57
NA,"of young Australians by over-large classes,",57
NA,untrained and semi-trained 'temporary*,57
NA,teachers and the unavailability of a whole,57
NA,"range of specialist teachers, particularly at",57
NA,crucial stages of the secondary course? Does,57
NA,he still believe that this is a matter which,57
NA,"'can be, and should be, left to the State",57
NA,governments'?,57
NA,Years were allowed to elapse before the,57
NA,Holt Government finally made available,57
NA,grants for the construction of buildings for,57
NA,new teachers colleges. In most States it was,57
NA,necessary for these grants to be used to re-,57
NA,place existing buildings which had outlived,57
NA,"their usefulness. In Victoria, the Teachers",57
NA,Union estimates that the grants will provide,57
NA,only a third of the sum actually required to,57
NA,provide adequate facilities. No assistance,57
NA,is being given with the recurrent costs of,57
NA,teacher training. Commonwealth teacher,57
NA,training scholarships recommended in the,57
NA,Martin report have not been provided.,57
NA,Unbonded teachers entitled to 10% of the,57
NA,new places created with the Commonwealth,57
NA,grant for buildings have therefore presum-,57
NA,ably been unable to take up those places.,57
NA,The number of additional places is in any,57
NA,"case paltry compared with the 10,000 which",57
NA,the Martin Committee estimated will be,57
NA,required by 1975.,57
NA,The Minister for Education and Science,57
NA,"refers frequently, fulsomely and fatuously",57
NA,to the fact that Commonwealth expenditure,57
NA,for education has risen in 5 years from,57
NA,$70m to $210m. Yet Australia is still spend-,57
NA,ing for education only 4.3% of its gross,57
NA,"national product, whereas the United States",57
NA,"spends 7.1%, Japan 6.8%, the Soviet Union",57
NA,6.2% and Britain 5.9%. We are still able,57
NA,to retain in full-time education only 33%,57
NA,"of our young people aged 15 to 19, whereas",57
NA,"the United States retains 68%, the Soviet",57
NA,"Union 52%, Canada 48% and the Nether-",57
NA,lands 45%.,57
NA,We still enable only 481 young Aus-,57
NA,"tralians for every 100,000 of population to",57
NA,"complete their secondary education, where-",57
NA,"as in Japan 2,014 do so, in the United States",57
NA,"1,450, in Britain 893 and in Italy 625. We",57
NA,produce only 149 graduates from tertiary,57
NA,"education for every 100,000 of population,",57
NA,"whereas the United States produces 325,",57
NA,"Japan 204, the Soviet Union 198 and",57
NA,Canada 186. Yugoslavia and Greece equal,57
NA,Australia in the proportion of their young,57
NA,people undergoing full time education.,57
NA,"Puerto Rico, Singapore and Taiwan excell",57
NA,us in the proportion of their young people,57
NA,who complete the secondary school course.,57
NA,Among 72 countries whose expenditure is,57
NA,listed by the Organisation for Economic,57
NA,"Co-operation and Development, Australia",57
NA,"ranks 37th. Consequently, although Aus-",57
NA,tralia has become one of the great mineral-,57
NA,"producing countries of the world, we have",57
NA,"only 1,300 geologists, whereas the United",57
NA,States with an area similar to our own has,57
NA,"20,000, and the Soviet Union with three",57
NA,"times our area has 90,000. Although we",57
NA,are one of the world's great centres of,57
NA,"animal husbandry, we have 6.5 veterinary",57
NA,"surgeons for every million head of stock,",57
NA,while Britain has 94 and the United States,57
NA,65. These deficiencies are an index of the,57
NA,government's 20-year failure to take an ade-,57
NA,quate or appropriate interest in education.,57
NA,"They are not, however, the only index. It",57
NA,is indicative of the Government's whole,57
NA,approach to education that the Prime Minis-,57
NA,"ter, the Attorney-General ( Mr Bowen) and",57
NA,the Minister for Education and Science have,57
NA,given serious consideration over recent,57
NA,months to withdrawing scholarships from,57
NA,students who participate in demonstrations.,57
NA,It is indicative that income derived by,57
NA,universities from fees increased between,57
NA,"1963 and 1966 by 234%, although enrol-",57
NA,"ments increased by only 32%. Clearly, the",57
NA,Government's policy is one of making uni-,57
NA,versities less free and more expensive.,57
NA,"Clearly, State governments oblige the uni-",57
NA,versities to increase their fees in order to,57
NA,squeeze greater sums from the Common-,57
NA,wealth through its commitment for scholar-,57
NA,"ships, to wit, the payment of fees for",57
NA,scholars.,57
NA,"In 1966, 10% of university income, or",57
NA,"$17m out of almost $171m, came from",57
NA,student fees and of these student fees 40%,57
NA,were paid by the Commonwealth. More,57
NA,than $135m came from Commonwealth,57
NA,and. State government grants. The aboli-,57
NA,tion of fees would cost only $llm but,57
NA,would produce many favourable results.,57
NA,There would be a temporary strain on,57
NA,"university places, but it would be fairer",57
NA,to have the places allotted on ability tban,57
NA,distributed by parental income or employer,57
NA,sponsorship. As free university places in-,58
NA,"creased, universities would cease to be",58
NA,regarded as places for an elite alone.,58
NA,Parents would recognise that a tertiary,58
NA,education is just as natural for their,58
NA,children as a primary and secondary educa-,58
NA,tion. Sweden plans education to the age,58
NA,of 18 years for 80% of its population,58
NA,by 1970 and for 96% of its population,58
NA,by 1980. I would recall that a generation,58
NA,ago Sweden had the lowest per capita in-,58
NA,come in Europe. Today it has the highest.,58
NA,It has made the maximum use of its natural,58
NA,and human resources. It has educated its,58
NA,people and its people therefore are able,58
NA,to make the maximum use of its natural,58
NA,resources.,58
NA,It is remarkable and reprehensible that,58
NA,any government should direct scarce educa-,58
NA,tional resources into the hands of those who,58
NA,need them least. A Labor government would,58
NA,not give scholarships to children whose,58
NA,families are in any case able to support,58
NA,them throughout their school careers while,58
NA,refusing grants to the schools on which,58
NA,underprivileged Australians depend for an,58
NA,equal opportunity in education. It would not,58
NA,finance second science blocks for wealthy,58
NA,non-government schools while other govern-,58
NA,ment and non-government schools are still,58
NA,waiting for their first blocks. Guided by a,58
NA,"representative schools commission, Labor",58
NA,will develop in both government and non-,58
NA,government schools the excellence which at,58
NA,present characterises an affluent and for-,58
NA,tunate few. Labor will invest discriminately,58
NA,in schools the resources required to over-,58
NA,come cultural deprivation and economic,58
NA,"disadvantage, lt will provide the living",58
NA,allowances which families with smaller,58
NA,incomes require to support children through-,58
NA,out their secondary school careers.,58
NA,Labor believes that able students should,58
NA,no longer be priced out of a university,58
NA,"education, as my deputy said in resuming",58
NA,the debate on this Bill. Labor will provide,58
NA,over three years an additional $llm a year,58
NA,to abolish fees at all Australian universities.,58
NA,For this investment the places for which,58
NA,fees are now charged will be filled by,58
NA,students on the basis of academic capacity,58
NA,and not financial capacity. As an integral,58
NA,part of its plan for the achievement of,58
NA,excellence in schools a Labor government,58
NA,will provide free teacher training for pros-,58
NA,pective teachers in both the government and,58
NA,non-government school systems.,58
NA,When the Commonwealth 12 years ago,58
NA,"entered upon its commitments, pursuant to",58
NA,"the Murray Committee's report, to help",58
NA,Australian universities it required the Uni-,58
NA,versity of Western Australia-th e only uni-,58
NA,versity in Australia which has been free-,58
NA,to charge fees over the course of the years,58
NA,equivalent to those charged in other univer-,58
NA,"sities. Accordingly, whereas in the last 11",58
NA,years other Australian universities have,58
NA,"doubled or trebled their fees, in the Univer-",58
NA,sity of Western Australia the fees which,58
NA,have now to be paid are ten times what,58
NA,"was paid in sports union, union and all",58
NA,other charges in the course of getting a,58
NA,university degree. Far from making univer-,58
NA,"sity education free, the Government has",58
NA,effectively ended free university education,58
NA,in the only university which had it. The,58
NA,Commonwealth used its money power io,58
NA,ensure that the University of Western Aus-,58
NA,tralia could not expand or improve with,58
NA,tbe funds which the Commonwealth alone,58
NA,could make available unless it abandoned,58
NA,its principles and imposed charges over the,58
NA,following decade to bring it into line with,58
NA,all the other universities in Australia-thos e,58
NA,already operating and those established in,58
NA,the interim.,58
NA,Only the Commonwealth can now ensure,58
NA,that an equal opportunity is given to every,58
NA,student to develop his natural talents irres-,58
NA,"pective of his parents' locality, relig on, :",58
NA,means or occupation. The parents and,58
NA,teachers of students at government schools,58
NA,must realise that they will not receive,58
NA,necessary assistance from the Common-,58
NA,wealth unless the Commonwealth also,58
NA,gives assistance to non-government schools.,58
NA,The parents and teachers at non-,58
NA,government schools must realise that they,58
NA,are unlikely to receive necessary assistance,58
NA,from the Commonwealth unless govern-,58
NA,ment schools are assisted by the Common-,58
NA,wealth. The Commonwealth must realise,58
NA,that it can involve itself as naturally in,58
NA,the affairs of all schools as it now does,58
NA,in the affairs of all tertiary institutions save,58
NA,teachers' colleges alone. It must accept as,58
NA,its aim the provision of services without,58
NA,charge at every level of the education,58
NA,"system. Scholarships, to which this Bill is",58
NA,"restricted, are a method of providing a",58
NA,free education for a minority of students,58
NA,who already excel!. They do nothing to,58
NA,"emancipate the majority of students, whose",59
NA,natural talents remain under existing con-,59
NA,ditions unrecognised and underdeveloped.,59
Mr GILES ,Angas) [9.27]-Th e first,59
NA,thing to which I would like to draw the,59
NA,attention of the House is the fascinating,59
NA,comment by the Leader of the Opposition The,59
NA,"( Mr Whitlam), by way of interjection, if",59
NA,"my ears did not deceive me, that the honourfor",59
NA,able member for Barton ( Mr Arthur) was,59
NA,reading from copious notes.,59
Mr WHITLAM ,An d reading poorly.,59
Mr GILES,"O n the contrary, it was the",59
NA,Leader of the Opposition who read poorly.,59
NA,I think ihe honourable member for Barton,59
NA,read rather well. I think that anybody,59
NA,would shoot arrows in the fashion of the,59
NA,Leader of the Opposition might at least,59
NA,adopt a more liberal method of putting,59
NA,over a speech so that it sounded a little,59
NA,more interesting for those on this side,59
NA,the House who had to listen to the honourit,59
NA,able gentleman struggling through it.,59
NA,I would remind the Leader of the Oppothe,59
NA,sition of one small point. Tonight he seemed,59
NA,to adopt a rather noval method of dealing,59
NA,with his topic. He employed phrases such,59
NA,as 'an affluent and fortunate few*. In the,59
NA,last few weeks he seems to have been conment,59
NA,ducting a personal vendetta-h e is not alone,59
NA,in this. He. would have us believe that,59
NA,"class war exists, as though we were still",59
NA,the throes of the depression. He also,59
NA,pletely contradicted remarks that he,59
NA,made in the past. I would like to quote,59
NA,remark passed about the Federal Governamount,59
NA,ment's record in education by a man,59
NA,Western Australia named Chamberlain.,59
NA,The remark was made at a meeting in,59
NA,March 1964.,59
NA,Mr Webb-Tak e your hand out of your,59
NA,pocket.,59
Mr GILES,Th e honourable member,59
NA,would need to take both hands out. Mr,59
NA,Chamberlain said:,59
NA,The establishment by the Federal Government,59
NA,of science blocks and the provision of science,59
NA,facilities in private schools is quite obviously con-,59
NA,trary to Federal Party policy.,59
NA,Within a few weeks the Leader of the,59
NA,Opposition had said that he thought that,59
NA,the Government's decision was consistent,59
NA,with the prime socialist objective of ensurreason,59
NA,ing an equal opportunity for all in life.,59
NA,does the Leader of the Opposition reconcile,59
NA,that encouraging statement about the,59
NA,Government's policy on education with his,59
NA,discovery tonight of the class war? He re-,59
NA,"ferred to an affluent and fortunate few, and",59
NA,used these sorts of phrases. I suppose there,59
NA,are one or two reasons to account for this.,59
NA,"first, I expect, is that he imagines there",59
NA,is an election due shortly and he is scuffling,59
NA,cover in view of his other rather un-,59
NA,fortunate thoughts in terms of aid to all,59
NA,sections of education. The second reason,59
NA,undoubtedly would be that the case of the,59
NA,Commonwealth Government in the field of,59
NA,education has been so remarkably success-,59
NA,ful in the eyes of the people of Australia,59
NA,that frankly all that is left to do is to,59
NA,who mouth a few words of encouragement along,59
NA,the line.,59
NA,This time last year the Leader of the,59
NA,Opposition congratulated the Government,59
NA,of on its Socialist objective and the efforts,59
NA,"was putting into education. This year,",59
NA,things being different when they are not,59
NA,"same, he seems to take a different point",59
NA,of view. Let us look at some of these facts,59
NA,or at some of his opinions. The first matter,59
NA,to which he referred and which alarmed,59
NA,me-an d I think rightly so-wa s his state-,59
NA,that there was an intentional slowing,59
NA,down by the Government in various fields,59
NA,a of education. This is the most rotten,59
NA,"in statement that I have heard for some time,",59
NA,comand that is saying plenty. The Govern-,59
NA,has ment's record is one of doubling the,59
NA,a number of scholarships of doubling the,59
NA,spent within a period of 5 or 7,59
NA,from years in every category of education,59
NA,covered by this Bill. The honourable,59
NA,member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham),59
NA,is trying to interject. Queensland has not,59
NA,a remarkably good record in any of these,59
NA,fields due to the terrible fact that it had a,59
NA,long and dismal run of Labor State govern-,59
NA,ments which put Queensland so far behind,59
NA,every other State in the field of education,59
NA,that frankly it is not funny if you look,59
NA,at national need at this point of time.,59
NA,"Leaving that matter aside, the Leader of",59
NA,the Opposition then said that the national,59
NA,aspirations of the younger people of today,59
NA,were for greater education. I suppose he,59
NA,was logically thinking that that is the,59
NA,why they supported his Party in the,59
NA,How new electorates during the last general,59
NA,election. Any opposition can sit back and,60
NA,"come good with wild ideas, it having no",60
NA,"responsibility, no power of the purse and",60
NA,not having to draw up its own priorities.,60
NA,It just talks for the sake of talking. As,60
NA,"far as I am concerned, this Government",60
NA,has given a lead to this country in a very,60
NA,few years that has meant that education,60
NA,has gone on step by step to the remarkably,60
NA,successful stage at which we find it today.,60
NA,Over the last few years the number of,60
NA,"Commonwealth scholarships given, for",60
NA,"instance, in terms of applicants has been",60
NA,better than 1 in 4. This is at a time when,60
NA,the whole population of Australia is in-,60
NA,creasing its affluence and its determination,60
NA,for education and when people on the,60
NA,minimal wage in this country are succeed-,60
NA,"ing, through their own thrift, in sending",60
NA,children right through education-righ t,60
NA,through university courses. They are doing,60
NA,this in some cases of which 1 know-no t,60
NA,frequently-regrettabl y without the benefit,60
NA,of scholarships because they have not won,60
NA,them. This is the stage which this country,60
NA,has reached. People want to provide for,60
NA,their children and send them on to higher,60
NA,education. I do not think it is any use the,60
NA,Opposition thinking back to the days when,60
NA,"these things could not be done, because",60
NA,they have been done.,60
NA,1 feel rather keenly on this matter because,60
NA,a relation of mine who happened to be,60
NA,quite brilliant- a female-wen t through an,60
NA,economics degree course in the 1950s. She,60
NA,got her Batchelor of Economics degree. She,60
NA,went on and did her Master of Economics,60
NA,"degree, and passed with top honours in",60
NA,every subject. In those days this unfortu-,60
NA,nate girl who was highly qualified and,60
NA,"highly educated but who, perhaps because",60
NA,"she was a female, could not get a job,",60
NA,because there was no room within the,60
NA,economy of the nation at that time for that,60
NA,"sort of qualification, if the person concerned",60
NA,was a female. This molehill does not make,60
NA,"a mountain, but I think the point was taken",60
NA,very well by my friend the honourable,60
NA,member for Barton ( Mr Arthur) a short,60
NA,time ago when he referred to the necessity,60
NA,for a national balance in education. The,60
NA,way in which this should be done has been,60
NA,accurately described by numerous expert,60
NA,committees which have looked into this,60
NA,question. They have said that we need a,60
NA,balance in education today.,60
NA,It is quite wrong on any statistic to adopt,60
NA,the point of view which the Leader of the,60
NA,Opposition adopted when he said that the,60
NA,Government was attempting to slow down,60
NA,these things. In any figures at which one,60
NA,cares to look-an d I will not weary the,60
NA,House by repeating them-ther e is the fact,60
NA,that the number of universities in this,60
NA,country has approximately trebled in the,60
NA,last 9 years. But it is no earthly use having,60
NA,a whole nation of university graduates. 1,60
NA,think that any honourable member opposite,60
NA,will agree with me that this is so. One can,60
NA,talk about the national aspirations of the,60
NA,"young people. One can try to ensure, as",60
NA,"well as a government can, that every student",60
NA,"will be given, as far as possible, equal",60
NA,opportunity. But there are many people in,60
NA,the community today who do not feel that,60
NA,half the youngsters of Australia should be,60
NA,university graduates. Many people in Aus-,60
NA,tralia today do not feel that this is the way,60
NA,in which Australia should go.,60
NA,"As I said previously, many expert com-",60
NA,mittees have laid it on the counter quite,60
NA,clearly that our shortage in education in,60
NA,Australia today is in the field of technology.,60
NA,It is not only we who have in this Held a,60
NA,shortage of trained and technically accom-,60
NA,plished young people; this is the case in the,60
NA,developing countries around us. 1 think that,60
NA,"the Leader of the Opposition, when he",60
NA,"makes some of his sweeping statements, for-",60
NA,"gets a lot of matters, including the fantastic",60
NA,effort of this Government in the field of,60
NA,providing scholarships under the Colombo,60
NA,"Plan, and the role which we are playing in",60
NA,the region in which we live. There are Asian,60
NA,people training in this country today who,60
NA,in other countries would comprise an entitre,60
NA,university. This is a mighty performance.,60
NA,"I think, perhaps, it might be as well to",60
NA,"look, for instance, at the number of new",60
NA,enrolments and total enrolments since the,60
NA,inception of the Commonwealth scholar-,60
NA,"ship scheme. In 1951 there were 28,000",60
NA,total enrolments. In 1961 total enrolments,60
NA,"had approximately doubled to 52,000.",60
NA,Between 1961 and 1968 they increased to,60
NA,"90,000. Once again there has been almost",60
NA,a doubling in the number. This Government,60
NA,"has succeeded in providing scholarships at,",60
NA,"by and large, an increasing rate, contrary to",60
NA,"the point made, I think, by the Deputy",60
NA,"Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard), who",60
NA,"referred, perhaps, to a shorter number of",60
NA,"years, and contrary to the point made by",61
NA,the Leader of the Opposition. Over 8 years,61
NA,this Government has succeeded in maintain-,61
NA,ing the same ratio of scholarships to tolal,61
NA,enrolments. In the years to which I have,61
NA,"just referred, 1951 to 1968, the number of",61
NA,"total enrolments not only doubled, but it",61
NA,doubled again. This is no mean feat. Quite,61
NA,"contrary to the position in 1951, as the",61
NA,honourable member for Barton quite accur-,61
NA,ately described it when scholarships were,61
NA,down to 400 for the whole of Australia,61
NA,at the end of the period of rule by the,61
NA,Australian Labor Party and total enrolments,61
NA,"at universities were only 28,000, enrolments",61
NA,"today are nearly 90,000 and the percentage",61
NA,of scholarships from 1951 onwards has,61
NA,"improved. Therefore, I do not think that the",61
NA,Leader of the Opposition is telling the,61
NA,whole story when he refers to only one,61
NA,factor. There are other factors involved,61
NA,that are very important and I think amply,61
NA,vindicate the Government for the mighty,61
NA,effort it has put into the field of education,61
NA,over the years.,61
NA,Another favourite trick of the Opposition,61
NA,on any debate on education is to impress,61
NA,on this House and those who might be,61
NA,listening to a broadcast thc deep national,61
NA,importance of education. 1 accept thut it is,61
NA,nationally important. It has very significant,61
NA,national implications indeed. But the Oppo-,61
NA,sition always glosses over the fact that we,61
NA,are living in a federation and the State,61
NA,vernments do take seriously their responsi-,61
NA,bilities in the field of education. If the,61
NA,Opposition convinced the Government,61
NA,today that we should have a national in-,61
NA,"quiry into education I profoundly believe,",61
NA,on the knowledge that I have of my own,61
NA,"State and others adjoining it, that the State",61
NA,governments would not co-operate 'vith the,61
NA,Commonwealth in such an inquiry. If I am,61
NA,"right-an d I cannot, of course, give evi-",61
NA,dence that I am-wha t is the point in the,61
NA,Opposition repeatedly requesting the Go-,61
NA,vernment to hold a national inquiry into,61
NA,education? I wonder who is bluffing whom,61
NA,on this matter.,61
NA,The Leader of the Opposition mentioned,61
NA,"my own State of South Australia, :n rather",61
NA,"a derogatory fashion, I felt. I do not",61
NA,why he picked on the South Australian,61
NA,vernment. One would have thought that he,61
NA,"might have picked on, for instance, the",61
NA,"Tasmanian Governnient, because at that",61
NA,point of his argument he was playing down,61
NA,the interest of Liberal governments in edu-,61
NA,"cation. But, to be fair, he did not do so.",61
NA,Instead he mentioned South Australia and,61
NA,said that South Australia is running its own,61
NA,inquiry into education. If he had net been,61
NA,reading his speech I would have interjected,61
NA,and asked him why he thought that South,61
NA,Australia should not inquire inio its educa-,61
NA,tion system. Although we give section 96,61
NA,"grants and other grants to the States, the",61
NA,responsibility for education is still with 'he,61
NA,States and I know of no reason why the,61
NA,South Australian Government should not,61
NA,hold an inquiry into education if it wishes,61
NA,to. I agree that State committees of inquiry,61
NA,into State education systems must be,61
NA,"limited. But then, so is the responsibility of",61
NA,thc Commonwealth Government of today,61
NA,limited.,61
NA,"lt is easy, I suppose, for the Opposition",61
NA,to imagine what it would do if it attained,61
NA,office. Would its attitude be any difierent,61
NA,from that of the Government today? If it,61
NA,"were, would it be accused of being centralist",61
NA,and of trying to dictate to the States in,61
NA,these matters? Would the Australian people,61
NA,agree that the Commonwealth should so,61
NA,"dictate? ff the answer to this is no, then, as",61
NA,"I asked before, what is tbe basis for this",61
NA,suggestion of a national inquiry? Is it based,61
NA,on reality or is it based cn bluff? What is,61
NA,the Opposition's point in coming forward,61
NA,go- so frequently devoid of argument ond rely-,61
NA,ing solely on the demand for a ig inquiry?,61
NA,h,61
NA,This has been going on for 5 years now to,61
NA,my certain knowledge.,61
NA,The Leader of the Opposition also,61
NA,attacked the Government with an argument,61
NA,based on the percentage of gross national,61
NA,product spent on education in Australia.,61
NA,I think the original idea for this form of,61
NA,attack came from Professor Karmel of,61
NA,South Australia who made a comparison,61
NA,many years ago of the percentage of gross,61
NA,national product spent on education in,61
NA,various countries. His comments and com-,61
NA,parisons were always taken out of perspec-,61
NA,tive by those who wished to use a com-,61
NA,"parison without telling the whole, story. I",61
NA,remember that very shortly after Professor,61
NA,"know Karmel made those statements, and after",61
NA,"GoI had heard Opposition, both State and",61
NA,"Federal, attacking governments on the basis",61
NA,"of Professor Karmel's ngures, I ran into",61
NA,him in South Australia and asked him,61
NA,about the different standards adopted in,62
NA,different countries in connection with ex-,62
NA,penditure on education. I knew very little,62
NA,about it at that tirne. He set to to tell me,62
NA,the different standards adopted in various,62
NA,"countries. I do not remember them all now,",62
NA,"but I do remember, for instance, that ex-",62
NA,penditure on education in the United King-,62
NA,dom includes the cost of free lunches. I,62
NA,expect that in Queensland it would include,62
NA,the cost of air-conditioning plants-bu t I do,62
NA,not know. There was a wide variety of edu-,62
NA,cational costs in the English total figures,62
NA,on which the percentage of gross national,62
NA,product was based.,62
NA,The standards vary widely from country,62
NA,"to country. If I remember rightly, in",62
NA,Switzerland the education costs included,62
NA,interest on capital expenditure incurred in,62
NA,tbe construction of school buildings. I would,62
NA,deny very vigorously that Australia suffers,62
NA,"at all, on any comparison in real terms",62
NA,"rather than imaginary ones, based on a",62
NA,percentage of gross national product.,62
NA,"Frankly, I have not looked at these figures",62
NA,for 18 months or so. But when I last looked,62
NA,at them I was quite convinced that this,62
NA,country had nothing to be worried about,62
NA,on any comparison based on a percentage,62
NA,of gross national product.,62
NA,Those are briefly the points in the speech,62
NA,of the Leader of the Opposition that in-,62
NA,"terested me. I would like, for a moment,",62
NA,to get back to the terms of the legislation,62
NA,"itself. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,",62
NA,who spoke before the Leader of the Oppo-,62
NA,"sition, referred to the 1967 Act which was",62
NA,put before another place during that year,62
NA,requesting sweeping powers. He said that,62
NA,the other place at that time argued in,62
NA,favour of regulations. The Government at,62
NA,"that time, probably being aware of the",62
NA,"situation then existing, accepted many of",62
NA,the remarks and comments made in the,62
NA,"other place. Several people, one of whom",62
NA,was mentioned by the Leader of the Oppo-,62
NA,"sition by name, now have confidence in",62
NA,this legislation.,62
NA,I notice that the Deputy Leader of the,62
NA,Opposition referred to clause 11 of the,62
NA,Scholarships Bill. Clause 11 deals with beneform.,62
NA,fits under Commonwealth secondary,62
NA,scholarships. The Deputy Leader of the,62
NA,Opposition pointed out that he would have,62
NA,no complaint with clauses 1 to 10. He said,62
NA,that his only complaint with clause 11 would,62
NA,revolve around the use of the word 'pre-,62
NA,scribed'. Clause 11 states:,62
NA,(a) the payment by the Commonwealth in re-,62
NA,spect of each year in which the scholarship,62
NA,"is held, for the purpose of assistance in",62
NA,relation to text boots and equipment for,62
NA,"use by the holder of the scholarship, of such",62
NA,amount as is prescribed for the purposes,62
NA,of this paragraph;,62
NA,I suppose the Deputy Leader of the Oppo-,62
NA,sition is slightly more experienced than I,62
NA,am in theses masters. But the use of the,62
NA,"word 'prescribed', to my way of thinking,",62
NA,can mean nothing other than 'prescribed by,62
NA,regulation'. If anyone has any doubt on,62
NA,"that, other than the Deputy Leader of the",62
NA,"Opposition, I would like to hear his inter-",62
NA,pretation. From my experience of State go-,62
NA,vernments and my minor experience here,62
NA,I know of no way in which we could inter-,62
NA,pret this term other than that it n eans 'pre-,62
NA,scribed by regulation'. Although I have not,62
NA,"had a chance to consult with the Minister,",62
NA,I have no doubt that he will say precisely,62
NA,the same thing as I am saying when he,62
NA,replies to the comments made by the,62
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition. As the,62
NA,"Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, the",62
NA,Bill sets up three criteria. As these were,62
NA,covered by the honourable member for,62
NA,"Barton, I will not repeat them. The only",62
NA,source of doubt in my mind was not re-,62
NA,ferred to by the Opposition. I refer to clause,62
NA,"19, which reads:",62
NA,"The Minister may, by instrument in writing",62
NA,Which I take to be definitely not,62
NA,verbally,62
NA,"delegate to a person, either generally or other-",62
NA,"wise as provided in the instrument of delegation,",62
NA,all or any of his powers or functions under this,62
NA,"Act, except this power of delegation.",62
NA,1 am not clear to whom this power can be,62
NA,delegated. I do not know whether it can,62
NA,be delegated to an officer of the Depart-,62
NA,ment of Education and Science or whether,62
NA,the person to which the clause refers must,62
NA,be a prescribed person. That is my main,62
NA,doubt. Having regard to the line of the,62
NA,debate in the other place on the previous,62
NA,"occasion, I have no doubts whatsoever,",62
NA,"except the one to which I have referred,",62
NA,about the wording of the Bill in its new,62
NA,A little while ago I referred to new enrol-,62
NA,ments and I quoted some figures. I thought,62
NA,that as soon as I could find some figures,62
NA,relevant to the contention by the Leader,63
NA,of the Opposition that the quality of pay-,63
NA,ments and aUowances in terms of the,63
NA,scholarships in the five fields covered by,63
NA,this Bill has not been kept up to standard,63
NA,I should cite them. I hope the figures 1,63
NA,have are entirely accurate and that I am,63
NA,not misquoting the Leader of the Opposi-,63
NA,tion when I say that he said that the,63
NA,quality of allowances and other payments,63
NA,had been downgraded by the Government,63
NA,over the years. One could argue whether,63
NA,his remarks are correct in every facet-i n,63
NA,relation to South Australia for instance.,63
NA,But they are not true of the Common-,63
NA,wealth's interest in its own scholarships.,63
NA,There are many indicators to support this,63
NA,contention. Let us take as an example the,63
NA,living away from home allowance which is,63
NA,paid fo full time scholars by the Common-,63
NA,"wealth Government. In 1961, 39% of those",63
NA,in receipt of scholarships claimed the living,63
NA,"away from home allowance. Today, 44.3%",63
NA,are claiming this allowance. This is in,63
NA,spite of the huge increase in enrolments at,63
NA,universities. Another indicator is the aver-,63
NA,age allowance per scholar. In 1961 it was,63
NA,$434; today it is $534. So these payments,63
NA,"have, in real terms, more than kept up with",63
NA,the standards set in the past. This is quite,63
NA,contrary to the remarks of the Leader of,63
NA,the Opposition on this matter.,63
NA,"Quite frankly, I think that the Opposi-",63
NA,tion is very wise in not opposing the Bill.,63
NA,The Opposition has adopted a typical,63
NA,tactic that it adopts from time to time of,63
NA,preaching that more of everything is good,63
NA,for all. I am happy with the Common-,63
NA,wealth's involvement in the field of educa-,63
NA,tion. I think it has proved lo be extremely,63
NA,worthwhile. The Commonwealth's rate of,63
NA,expenditure in this field is increasing,63
NA,enormously. I believe that the Common-,63
NA,wealth cannot just rush in and attempt to,63
NA,take over the control of education from the,63
NA,State governments. Frequently the State,63
NA,governments have a far more intimate,63
NA,knowledge of local priorities. Tn my view,63
NA,much of the control of education in the,63
NA,future must be retained by those closest to,63
NA,the local scene. I suppose it is all a matter,63
NA,of priorities. Any Opposition could habitu-,63
NA,ally take the point of view that there must,63
NA,toe more expenditure on everything. This is,63
NA,just a fact of life. I am quite sure that if,63
NA,one spoke quietly to many of the honourable,63
NA,members opposite one would find that they,63
NA,completely approve the Government's,63
NA,"record. But at this time of the year, with",63
NA,exciting times around the corner and elec-,63
NA,"tions hoving in view, it is customary for the",63
NA,Opposition to say: 'Let us spend a bit more,63
NA,on everything'.,63
NA,I support the Bill. 1 congratulate the,63
NA,Minister for Education and Science on the,63
NA,dedicated and lirst-class job that he is,63
NA,doing. 1 conclude my remarks by saying,63
NA,only one thing by way of complaint. 1 think,63
NA,that the means test on the living away from,63
NA,home allowance for scholarship holders-,63
NA,naturally this relates more to those living,63
NA,in country areas than it does to those living,63
NA,in city areas-shoul d be raised. Quite,63
NA,recently 1 had personal experience in this,63
NA,regard concerning two families living in,63
NA,"that fine area I represent, the Barossa Val-",63
NA,"ley, where incomes can be very erratic. 1",63
NA,seriously believe that the Government,63
NA,should relax the means test as it applies to,63
NA,living away from home allowances. I think,63
NA,"that where incomes are erratic, as they can",63
NA,be in areas where people do not have an,63
NA,"assured weekly salary, people can be dis-",63
NA,"advantaged. I think you will agree, Mr",63
NA,"Deputy Speaker, that that is a very small",63
NA,suggestion lo make. I congratulate the,63
NA,Government upon its education policy.,63
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Lucock),63
NA,-Order ! The honourable member's time,63
NA,has expired.,63
NA,Dr PA1TERSON (Dawson) [9.58]- 1,63
NA,support the remarks made by the Deputy,63
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) and,63
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whidam).,63
NA,1 have listened with interest to the honour-,63
NA,able member for Barton ( Mr Arthur) and the,63
NA,honourable member for Angas ( Mr Giles).,63
NA,What struck me most about their remarks,63
NA,was their attempts to criticise the Leader,63
NA,of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of,63
NA,the Opposition for raising the point that,63
NA,there are many parents in Australia who,63
NA,cannot afford to send their children to,63
NA,places of higher learning. The honourable,63
NA,"member for Barton and, to the best of my",63
NA,"knowledge, the honourable member for",63
NA,Angas said that the Australian Labor Party,63
NA,"was living in the past, the post-depression",63
NA,"years, and that this is 1969. 1 do not know",63
NA,what sort of electorates the honourable,63
NA,"members for Barton and Angas represent,",63
NA,but it is quite obvious that they mix in only,63
NA,the most elite circles. They do not have any,64
NA,contact with tbe under privileged people,64
NA,who must surely exist even in their,64
NA,electorates.,64
Mr GILES ,Th e average person in my,64
NA,electorate would earn less than the average,64
NA,person in your electorate; make no mistake.,64
Dr PATTERSON,Th e honourable,64
NA,member has had his say. There must be,64
NA,people in his electorate who cannot afford,64
NA,to send their children to places of higher,64
NA,"learning, such as an institute of technology",64
NA,or a university. Certainly in the areas that,64
NA,I know there is still a large proportion of,64
NA,parents who do not have sufficient means,64
NA,to be able to send their children-eve n,64
NA,if those children have the capacity-t o,64
NA,places of higher learning. The honourable,64
NA,member instanced a relative of his who,64
NA,"gained, t sbould think with honours or",64
NA,"distinction, the degree of Master of",64
NA,Economics and could not find a job. I do,64
NA,not quarrel with the honourable member,64
NA,"about the facts, but I find it extraordinary",64
NA,"because in the 1950s, the period he quoted,",64
NA,there was a tremendous demand for trained,64
NA,economists. That was a period when,64
NA,economists were coming into their own in,64
NA,increasing numbers as compared with arts,64
NA,students. There were few university,64
NA,graduates in economics and my own ex-,64
NA,perience at that time was that there was,64
NA,"a dearth- a shortage-o f economists, parti-",64
NA,cularly those with the degree of Master of,64
NA,Economics. It is possible that the particular,64
NA,person to whom the honourable member,64
NA,referred may have wanted to specialise in,64
NA,a certain field of economics and there may,64
NA,not have been opportunities in that field.,64
NA,"But speaking generally there is, always has",64
NA,been and will be in the near future anyhow,64
NA,a strong demand for trained economists.,64
NA,I was not certain what the honourable,64
NA,"member for Angas meant, but if he meant",64
NA,"what I think he meant, I agree with him",64
NA,that there is an imbalance with respect to,64
NA,the types of graduates who are graduating,64
NA,from Australian universities. He made the,64
NA,point that there is a serious deficiency in,64
NA,the field of technology. He did not define,64
NA,"technology, but technology, of course, can",64
NA,include university graduates in the fields,64
NA,of engineering and in the sciences for ex-,64
NA,ample. The main point I wish to make,64
NA,concerns the problem of priorities and how,64
NA,the Commonwealth Scholarships Board,64
NA,13861/69-«-144 ],64
NA,allocates or weights priorities between dis-,64
NA,ciplines-betwee n faculties-i n the Aus-,64
NA,"tralian universities, because I believe that",64
NA,the granting of Commonwealth scholarships,64
NA,at Australian universities should bear some,64
NA,direct relationship to the urgent problems,64
NA,facing our economy today. 1 find it totally,64
NA,unacceptable that the Commonwealth,64
NA,Scholarships Board should allocate a total,64
NA,of 47 post-graduate scholarships in agri-,64
NA,culture and veterinary science compared,64
NA,with 108 post-graduate scholarships in,64
NA,French and German. I cannot accept that,64
NA,post-graduate research in French and Ger-,64
NA,man is more important than post-graduate,64
NA,work in agriculture and veterinary science.,64
NA,I am not in any way trying to degrade,64
NA,post-graduate work in French and German,64
NA,but I cannot accept that French and German,64
NA,post-graduate work is at least twice as,64
NA,important in the Commonwealth's eyes as,64
NA,post-graduate work in agriculture and,64
NA,veterinary science.,64
NA,Mr Kevin Cairns-Wha t was the demand,64
NA,for each scholarship?,64
Dr PATTERSON,I f the honourable,64
NA,"member wants to speak, why does he not",64
NA,do so? He will probably follow his usual,64
NA,practice of not speaking but sitting on the,64
NA,sidelines and interjecting. It is apparent that,64
NA,there is a clear need for a revision of the,64
NA,priorities with respect to these scholarships.,64
NA,I am only going to give this one example,64
NA,because I believe this is an applied result,64
NA,of scholarship training. I am comparing the,64
NA,scholarships awarded for agriculture and,64
NA,veterinary science with those awarded for,64
NA,other faculties. Despite the great advances,64
NA,in secondary and tertiary industries it must,64
NA,be recognised that primary industry is still,64
NA,the backbone of Australia's economy. As,64
NA,"I said before, when one looks at the post-",64
NA,graduate scholarships in agriculture and,64
NA,veterinary science and compares them with,64
NA,post-graduate scholarships in other dis-,64
NA,ciplines I rank the former as a practical,64
NA,type of scholarship which has a tremendous,64
NA,application to the Australian economy.,64
NA,If we look at the annual report regarding,64
NA,post-graduate awards we find that post-,64
NA,graduate scholarships in music arefivetimes,64
NA,as many as post-graduate scholarships in,64
NA,veterinary science. I understand that the,64
NA,honourable member for Griffith ( Mr,64
NA,Donald Cameron) has some claim to being,64
NA,a musician- I am not sure whether that,64
NA,"is right or not, but I understand he likes",65
NA,music. Perhaps he may be willing to justify,65
NA,the provision of significantly more scholar-,65
NA,"ships for music students. However, I fail to",65
NA,see why there should be five times as many,65
NA,post-graduate scholarships for music as,65
NA,"there are for veterinary science. Of course,",65
NA,the answer may be that more people are,65
NA,doing music than veterinary science. If this,65
NA,"is the situation, it is time something were",65
NA,done to encourage more people to do,65
NA,veterinary science. Tf there is one industry,65
NA,today which is dependent on veterinary,65
NA,science it is the export meat industry. Those,65
NA,who are associated with it in one way or,65
NA,another know that the export meat industry,65
NA,is in jeopardy because of the shortage of,65
NA,trained veterinary scientists. A very serious,65
NA,problem is developing between the United,65
NA,States Government and the Australian,65
NA,Government over the supply of veterinary,65
NA,scientists. Unless we can get veterinary,65
NA,scientists in our Australian export abattoirs,65
NA,there is the risk that we may not be able,65
NA,to export from those abattoirs.,65
NA,1 am using this only as a practical,65
NA,"example because, as I have said before,",65
NA,have no wish to criticise or degrade postpeople,65
NA,"graduate work in French, German or music,",65
NA,but as far as I am concerned-an,65
NA,I am biased- I believe that post-graduate,65
NA,"work in engineering, agriculture and vete-",65
NA,rinary science is more important to this,65
NA,nation when Commonwealth funds are Australia?,65
NA,involved. I am not saying this in respect of,65
NA,the funds of private individuals who can do,65
NA,"what they like, but I am concerned where",65
NA,Commonwealth funds are involved. This,65
NA,the principle I am arguing: Some priority,65
NA,"should be given, in the actual allocation",65
NA,"of funds, to the various disciplines and",65
NA,faculties. In Australia there are areas,65
NA,work that are crying out for more trained,65
NA,"men, because there is a shortage of such",65
NA,men. I do not know whether there is,65
NA,"shortage of graduates in French, German",65
NA,or music. Perhaps there are. But I do know,65
NA,that there is a severe shortage of trained,65
NA,agricultural scientists to do very valuable,65
NA,work in the arid zone of Australia for,65
NA,example. This zone is of extreme imporwill,65
NA,"tance to Australia, but it is an area about",65
NA,which we know very Httle. We need ecopersonnel.,65
NA,"logists, botanists, agronomists and climatolo-",65
NA,gists-peopl e trained in the specialties of,65
NA,agricultural or applied science-t o work on,65
NA,various problems in this area. I am arguing,65
NA,that some greater priority should be given,65
NA,to the practical side-t o those areas where,65
NA,there is a definite shortage of trained men.,65
NA,In the northern parts of Australia we have,65
NA,a severe shortage of agricultural scientists,65
NA,to work in the field of tropical pastures.,65
NA,This is a field which has tremendous scope,65
NA,for development and the increase of export,65
NA,income. We must do everything possible to,65
NA,train graduates at universities and to,65
NA,encourage post-graduate research in the,65
NA,specialised fields of tropical agriculture and,65
NA,tropical pastures.,65
NA,This Government pays a subsidy on,65
NA,"nitrogen, but very little is known in Aus :",65
NA,"tralia about the effect, of nitrogen on",65
NA,pastures. Most of the elements that have,65
NA,been applied to pastures have been phos?,65
NA,"phatic materials, not nitrogenous materials.",65
NA,The Commonwealth Scientific and Indus-,65
NA,trial Research Organisation and the Depart-,65
NA,ment of Primary Industries in Queensland,65
NA,is showing that a tremendous response can,65
NA,be achieved by applying' nitrogen to native,65
NA,pastures and to some species of natural,65
NA,grass such as pangola grass. There is a,65
NA,1 shortage of agricultural scientists and,65
NA,trained in this field who can get the,65
NA,knowledge across to the farmer and show,65
NA,d perhaps him what can be achieved.,65
Mr GILES ,Wha t work has been done on,65
NA,this overseas that could be applied to,65
Dr PATTERSON, I do not think suffi-,65
NA,cient work has been done yet for us to,65
NA,is draw analogies. Researchers must be able,65
NA,"to set up their experiments, interpret their",65
NA,"results, put forward their hypotheses and",65
NA,by induction pass their knowledge on to,65
NA,of the farmer or the grazier. But we have not,65
NA,got these men. The. CSIRO and the State,65
NA,departments of agriculture - will tell us that,65
NA,a we cannot get these men because there,65
NA,are not sufficient numbers of them going,65
NA,through the universities. I make the point,65
NA,again that I cannot find anything in this,65
NA,Bill nor in the explanation in the second,65
NA,reading speech that shows that any priority,65
NA,be given to those fields of work where,65
NA,there is a definite shortage of trained,65
NA,I do not wish to say anything more than,65
NA,"that, but I would hope that the Minister",65
NA,will take my remarks as being of some,65
NA,value. I have given examples of certain,65
NA,"practical fields where there"" are shortages",66
NA,of university graduates who could make,66
NA,contributions to the Australian economy.,66
NA,I am not saying that more research should,66
NA,not be done in the arts or the social,66
NA,"sciences. We certainly need that, but to me",66
NA,at least there is some imbalance in the,66
NA,distribution of post-graduate scholarships,66
NA,in particular in this country. In conclu-,66
NA,sion.. I would say that this position should,66
NA,"be corrected if possible, because the grant-",66
NA,ing of scholarships should not bear a direct,66
NA,relationship to the number of enrolments,66
NA,in each faculty at universities. Because the,66
NA,"arts faculty, for example, may have ten",66
NA,times the number of students that the,66
NA,"faculty of agricultural science has, this does",66
NA,not mean that arts students should receive,66
NA,ten times the number of post-graduate,66
NA,scholarships that agricultural science,66
NA,students receive.,66
Mr BRYANT ,Wills) [10.14]-I n many,66
NA,ways in this BiM we see a change in Ihe,66
NA,way in which the Commonwealth Govern-,66
NA,ment looks at education. I suppose we can,66
NA,say that the 1945 Education Act arrived,66
NA,with a bang because it marked the entry,66
NA,of the Commonwealth into the field of edu-,66
NA,cation in a legislative way for the first time.,66
NA,Since then it seems to have vanished from,66
NA,the field without even a whimper. It is time,66
NA,the attention of the House was drawn to,66
NA,the fact that what was the original charter,66
NA,of this Parliament in regard to education,66
NA,has been withdrawn and has been replaced,66
NA,by a definition of certain areas of scholar-,66
NA,ships. These scholarships are granted on a,66
NA,competitive basis and are about the only,66
NA,area of Commonwealth activity in educa-,66
NA,tion today. So I think it is time that we,66
NA,applied ourselves to some of the principles,66
NA,upon which the Commonwealth Parliament,66
NA,ought to be operating.,66
NA,Tonight we are considering what one,66
NA,might call a hotch-potch of political seda-,66
NA,tives. In recent years the Government has,66
NA,"concentrated on various fields, some of",66
NA,which have been politically expedient. I,66
NA,refer io the Commonwealth grants to the,66
NA,States for science laboratories and second-,66
NA,"ary school libraries. In general, at times,",66
NA,the Government has done whatever has,66
NA,been politically expedient. I do not know,66
NA,whether it is because of pressure from the,66
NA,universities or pressure from other bodies,66
NA,for scholarships in certain fields that it has,66
NA,done this. I see no concept of a Common-,66
NA,wealth education policy. I see no plan or,66
NA,system being developed. If Australian edu-,66
NA,"cation needs anything, it is planning and",66
NA,some systematic approach.,66
NA,1 deny the assertions by honourable,66
NA,members opposite that we members of the,66
NA,Opposition are centralist to the extent that,66
NA,we want everything controlled from some,66
NA,press button system operating in Canberra.,66
NA,We are nothing of the sort. Those of us,66
NA,concerned with education on this side of the,66
NA,House would be the first to admit that we,66
NA,do not know quite the best way in which,66
NA,communities ought to participate in educa-,66
NA,tion or the best way of utilising the great,66
NA,resources of national effort that are avail-,66
NA,able to us. I have a hope that somewhere,66
NA,in Canberra perhaps these problems are,66
NA,being worked out. I would like to see Com-,66
NA,monwealth ancl State officials sitting side by,66
NA,"side, working almost in the same office, on",66
NA,a modus operandi for educational effort that,66
NA,would be an example to the whole of,66
NA,Australia. Perhaps it is possible to get this,66
NA,kind of co-operation by establishing a sys-,66
NA,tem of local education authorities through-,66
NA,"out Auslralia, each covering, say 150,000",66
NA,"to 200,000 people. There is no doubt that",66
NA,with the administrative competence thai is,66
NA,"available to us, with the financial stability",66
NA,that enables us to give anything if we really,66
NA,"try, and with the lines of communication",66
NA,that are available no matter where any per-,66
NA,"son may live, we ought to be able to",66
NA,achieve something.,66
NA,My regret is that in this instance we are,66
NA,repealing what is the fundamental charter,66
NA,of this Parliament and replacing it with a,66
NA,very singlcminded education objective. In,66
NA,some ways I am one of those who believe,66
NA,that scholarships do not have strictly educa-,66
NA,tional objectives. They represent some ideal,66
NA,which I reject as an educational ideal. 1,66
NA,"know, of course, that some of the honour-",66
NA,able members opposite seem to be com-,66
NA,pletely out of sympathy with our approach,66
NA,to education. 1 think it was the honourable,66
NA,member for Angas ( Mr Giles) who sug-,66
NA,gested that the Leader of the Opposition,66
NA,( Mr Whitlam) was dredging up some,66
NA,elements of the class war. I am not sure,66
NA,"what exactly he did say, but I know that",66
NA,he attacked the concept that there is,66
NA,economic deprivation in the field of educa-,66
NA,tion in Australia. One only has to look at,66
NA,the honourable member's background to see,67
NA,that he does not know what serious to,67
NA,"economic deprivation could mean, and 1 in Victoria.",67
NA,would not like to wish economic hardship,67
NA,upon him.,67
NA,At the present time the Minister for,67
NA,Education and Science ( Mr Malcolm,67
NA,Fraser) in all his public announcements,67
NA,seems to be concerned with non-State,67
NA,education. We can look at his public,67
NA,announcements and see that they are always,67
NA,concerned with some political gimmickry,67
NA,such as what we are to do with what are,67
NA,"technically called independent, schools.",67
NA,"course, independent schools are non-existent",67
NA,anyhow. I do not see any approach to,67
NA,education in the total sense. I would remind,67
NA,honourable members that the 1945 Educabe,67
NA,tion Act imposed some seven or eight,67
NA,obligations upon the Commonwealth Office,67
NA,of Education. One would presume that the,67
NA,Department of Education and Science has,67
NA,become the beir of the functions of this,67
NA,body. What has been happening to some,67
NA,of these obligations? One obligation was,67
NA,advise the Minister on matters relating,67
NA,education. I. have no doubt that that is,67
NA,done. Another obligation was to establish,67
NA,and maintain a liaison on matters relating,67
NA,to education with other countries and with,67
NA,the States and to arrange for consultations,67
NA,between Commonwealth and,67
NA,authorities on matters relating to education.,67
NA,There were three or four more of them.,67
NA,- The interesting point is that tbis charter,67
NA,was enshrined in legislation and it was,67
NA,for all to read. Tonight we are repealing,67
NA,"that charter, we are removing it from the",67
NA,legislation. The Government makes no,67
NA,attack upon what I believe are the features,67
NA,of Australian education that ought to be,67
NA,under attack. What are we doing about probably,67
NA,inequalities in education? The Leader,67
NA,"the Opposition, tbe Deputy Leader of the",67
NA,Opposition ( Mr Barnard) and the honourpresent,67
NA,able member for Dawson (Dr Patterson),67
NA,have pointed out where some of these women,67
NA,inequalities lie. There is no doubt that,67
NA,are great inequalities in this country arising,67
NA,from geography. Some of it is political,67
NA,geography inasmuch as there is a difference,67
NA,between the capacity of universities in New,67
NA,South Wales and universities in Victoria,67
NA,absorb students. This is the product of,67
NA,political attitudes that have developed over,67
NA,a quarter to half a century. People in,67
NA,South Wales in general have greater access,67
NA,university education than people who live,67
NA,Then there is the geographical disability,67
NA,imposed upon people who live in remote,67
NA,areas. What are we doing lo allow people,67
NA,who pass through the secondary stage of,67
NA,"education in the remoter areas, of Australia",67
NA,to find satisfactory accommodation and,67
NA,financial support when they do go to the,67
NA,university? What are we doing to supply,67
NA,some mobility inside the university scheme,67
NA,so that the Australian National University,67
NA,"Of could be expanded by perhaps 4,000 or",67
NA,"5,000 students, or so that the university in",67
NA,"Tasmania, the one at Townsville or the one",67
NA,at Armidaie could be expanded? This might,67
NA,a more satisfactory method of approach-,67
NA,ing the problem tban expanding the metro-,67
NA,politan universities. One does not have to,67
NA,look very far to realise that there are great,67
NA,areas of economic deprivation in Australian,67
NA,education. I represent one of the industrial,67
NA,"areas of Australia, an area in which the",67
NA,to great majority of the. people are in the,67
NA,to lower income bracket. Every family whose,67
NA,"being children manage to matriculate, and even",67
NA,those whose children achieve a Common-,67
NA,"wealth scholarship, have a great struggle to",67
NA,get their children through to the university.,67
NA,The Government has made no approach to,67
NA,State this problem at all. The general Common-,67
NA,wealth scholarship scheme is based upon,67
NA,"what might be called academic excellence,",67
NA,or whatever it is that one achieves to get,67
NA,a satisfactory result at the secondary and,67
NA,"there tertiary level. As I said, there is no",67
NA,approach to this problem at all.,67
NA,Tlie great wastage in Australian educa-,67
NA,tion is the disability imposed upon women,67
NA,"by their sex. As I have said before, this is",67
NA,not a political' issue but is some-,67
NA,of thing to do with the society in which we,67
NA,live. I tbink the ngures show that at the,67
NA,"time about 60,000 or 70,000 young",67
NA,"men and about 25,000 or 30,000 young",67
NA,in Australia are at the universities.,67
NA,"there Between 40,000 and 50,000 young women",67
NA,"have the same capacities as their brothers,",67
NA,"and same social backgrounds, the same",67
NA,economic backgrounds and the same intel-,67
NA,lectual capacities. These girls who take out,67
NA,to prizes at certain levels of education some-,67
NA,how drop out of the system. This is a most,67
NA,tragic wastage. It is one that all honourable,67
NA,New members have to take up in some way or,67
NA,other if Australia is to get the greatest,68
NA,possible advantage from the intellectual,68
NA,capacity of the community.,68
NA,There is also the wastage based upon,68
NA,race. 1 raised this question this morning,68
NA,"during another debate, but during the day",68
NA,I received a new bulletin from the Com-,68
NA,monwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics.,68
NA,It showed the Aboriginal population of,68
NA,Australia. Figures at page 29 of that docu-,68
NA,ment show that 39.23% of the Aboriginal,68
NA,population have no education at all. Of,68
NA,course that includes 16% under school age;,68
NA,so 23% of the adult Aboriginal population,68
NA,have no education whatsoever. But in the,68
NA,non-Aboriginal community only about 1%,68
NA,have no education. Any Australian govern-,68
NA,ment conscious of its duty would be tackling,68
NA,these problems.,68
NA,What do we intend to do about the,68
NA,environment in which education is carried,68
NA,out? I suggest that honourable members,68
NA,should visit the schools in Canberra. These,68
NA,schools may have their deficiencies. I have,68
NA,heard Canberra citizens complain about,68
NA,"them, but compared with schools in the rest",68
NA,of Australia or in most areas of Australia,68
NA,"they are, although not exactly luxurious,",68
NA,substantially in advance of other schools.,68
NA,The Minister for Education and Science,68
NA,represents the western part of Victoria. I,68
NA,understand from his friends that he owns,68
NA,most of it. I suggest that he should drive,68
NA,a little further north out of his electorate,68
NA,"and visit the city of Horsham, which is",68
NA,the centre of one of the wealthiest pastoral,68
NA,areas in Australia. I visited the high school,68
NA,there last week. I did not know that there,68
NA,was any such school building in Australia.,68
NA,I represent an area in which there is a,68
NA,"great amount of neglect of school buildings,",68
NA,but thc Horsham High School building is a,68
NA,disgrace to Australia's education system.,68
NA,It is a disgrace to those people who have,68
NA,represented that area in this place and in,68
NA,the State Parliament. The walls of the,68
NA,building are cracking and the roofs are fall-,68
NA,ing in. One area of the walls is buttressed,68
NA,up and part of it is capable of inflicting,68
NA,both serious injury on people should it col-,68
NA,lapse and hardship by inflictions on health.,68
NA,I suggest that tbe Minister for Education,68
NA,and Science should take a drive up there and,68
NA,have a look at the buildings instead of,68
NA,worrying about some of the wealthy schools,68
NA,which his children and the children of his,68
NA,friends attend. He might even come along,68
NA,to the Moreland High School in my elec-,68
NA,torate which has some substantial new build-,68
NA,ings but where there is no room for any,68
NA,of the children to spread their wings.,68
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! I would remind,68
NA,the honourable member for Wills that this,68
NA,Bill deals with scholarships.,68
Mr BRYANT,Tha t is right.,68
Mr SPEAKER,Order! It does not cover,68
NA,the whole field of education. I remind the,68
NA,honourable member that I cannot see the,68
NA,relevance between the state of schools and,68
NA,the question of scholarships. I suggest the,68
NA,honourable member might get back to the,68
NA,Bill.,68
Mr BRYANT,"Wit h due respect, I point",68
NA,out that clause 3 repeals the Education,68
NA,Act of 1945. That Act sets out a number,68
NA,of functions for the Ministry and I am,68
NA,suggesting that those functions ought to have,68
NA,"been retained. I am producing, I hope,",68
NA,evidence that it needs Commonwealth atten-,68
NA,"tion. However, I intend to conclude my",68
NA,speech in a moment because I want my col-,68
NA,league the honourable member for Griffith,68
NA,"( Mr Donald Cameron) to have his say, not",68
NA,that he will often vote against the gag when,68
NA,it is applied against me.,68
NA,Fundamental requirements of education,68
NA,exist in the field of teaching. The Minister,68
NA,for Education and Science should consider,68
NA,making available scholarships to women in,68
NA,"their 30s, 40s and even in their 50s. A great",68
NA,"reservoir of skills, intellectual and otherwise,",68
NA,would be available in the community if,68
NA,there were a special system for training such,68
NA,"people. If Australia needed 20,000 or 30,000",68
NA,secondary teachers within the next few,68
NA,"year, with dramatic and dynamic planning",68
NA,and by offering something to women whose,68
NA,family responsibilities were nearing comple-,68
NA,tion it could obtain these teachers and have,68
NA,them qualified within 4 or 5 years. I have,68
NA,noted amongst my own circle of friends,68
NA,and in my own family the way in which,68
NA,many women are taking up university,68
NA,education quite late in life. Women in their,68
NA,40s still have a quarter of a century of profit-,68
NA,able professional endeavour before them.,68
NA,The present approach is quite unimaginative.,68
NA,The scholarship system that is inflicted upon,68
NA,the Australian community is a perpetuation,68
NA,of the continual competitive system of elitist,68
NA,education. Labor's philosophy is one of,69
NA,totality as compared to the competitive,69
NA,system wbich the Liberal Party and its,69
NA,lite inflict on society generally. I hope,69
NA,the Minister for Education and Science will,69
NA,shortly bring some omnibus legislation,69
NA,before the House to tell honourable,69
NA,members what the Government's proposals,69
NA,are to systematise Australian education.,69
Mr DONALD CAMERON ,Griffith) and,69
NA,"[10.28]- I fully realise that, time is moving",69
NA,on and the Minister. for' Education and,69
NA,Science ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) is preparing,69
NA,to close the debate. I refer briefly to.,69
NA,the charge . of . political gimmickry know,69
NA,laid by the honourable member. for Wills,69
NA,( Mr Bryant) against the Minister and his,69
NA,claim that every .time the Minister speaks,69
NA,what he says has something to do with gim-.,69
NA,micks. It is very easy for the honourable,69
NA,member for Wills to overlook the fact that,69
NA,the Minister has stated-thi s is not a,69
NA,of gimmickry-tha t in 1964-65 the expendiwork,69
NA,ture qn Commonwealth scholarships was,69
NA,$ 12.7m; in 1969 it was $28.9m; and that,69
NA,it is anticipated that in 1971-72 it will,69
NA,$35m. Since. 1964-65 the expenditure has,69
NA,"increased almost, threetimes, and yet",69
NA,the honourable member for Wills ( Mr,69
NA,shrugs it off. I refer also to remarks,69
NA,"made by the honourable, member",69
NA,"for Dawson (Dr Patterson), particularly his",69
NA,"claim about the shortage of veterinary,",69
NA,scientists. Perhaps the lack of incentive,69
NA,not just at the scholarship stage. It may,69
NA,be the end result when these men are out,69
NA,in the field. The honourable member for,69
NA,"Dawson, who himself is so close to the soil,",69
NA,knows that many prospective veterinary raised,69
NA,scientists opt out of this field and choose,69
NA,"medicine instead, perhaps because of the",69
NA,attractiveness and glory of the medical proin,69
NA,fession. I agree with him when he says that,69
NA,the situation has arisen in the country areas . which I have been concerned. The Leader,69
NA,where more than ever before technical,69
NA,knowledge is required.,69
NA,I liave risen to speak mainly on the,69
NA,ject of mature age scholarships. I am very,69
NA,pleased to see the Minister for Education,69
NA,and Science present tonight. He is aware,69
NA,that I have written various letters to,69
NA,on this subject. I am quite sure that the,69
NA,Minister himself is quite concerned about,69
NA,"this problem. However, for the purpose",69
NA,the record I want to state that at present,69
NA,we have 250 mature age scholarships. In,69
NA,my electorate in recent weeks I have had,69
NA,no fewer than eight people over 25 years,69
NA,satelof age who have approached' me with the,69
NA,that problem of whether or not they would,69
NA,receive a mature age scholarship. Many of,69
NA,these people are in their late 20s or early,69
NA,"30s. They left school at an early age and,",69
NA,in this society of ours which offers oppor-,69
NA,"tunity for self education, they, have reached",69
NA,the stage where they haye entered university,69
NA,have passed their first year. I sincerely,69
NA,hope that serious consideration will be,69
NA,given either to increasing the lower age,69
NA,limit to 30 or 35 or increasing'the number-,69
NA,of mature age scholarships available. I,69
NA,that a sad situation exists now. in that,69
NA,many second year students have no hope,69
NA,whatsoever ' of ' obtaining a scholarship.,69
NA,Many of them have acquired up to three,69
NA,distinctions and credits in their first year's,69
NA,"studies. Many who have perhaps done early,",69
NA,years at the university on a pari time basis,69
NA,matter and have had to face married life and,69
NA,during the day have had early failures,69
NA,takeninto consideration. I cannot allow the,69
NA,opportunity to pass without saying some-,69
NA,be thing on their behalf. I hope that a freer-,69
NA,attitude will be taken in - relation to this,69
NA,matter. I see that the Leader of the House-,69
NA,Erwin) is hot on my trail to ...s/se,69
NA,"me to cease, so on that note I 'conclude.",69
NA,Mr MALCOLM FRASER'. (Wannon-,69
NA,Minister for Education and. Science) [10.32],69
NA,is -i n reply- I would like to thank honour-,69
NA,able members for the remarks that they have,69
NA,made during this debate. I am glad to see,69
NA,that the Opposition in broad terms supports,69
NA,the Bill but a number of matters have been,69
NA,"that do, in part at least, require some",69
NA,kind of answer. I would like to apologise to,69
NA,the House for riot having been able to be,69
NA,"the chamber throughout the' debate, but-",69
NA,Cabinet has been meeting'on matters with,69
NA,1,69
NA,"of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), I am",69
NA,"advised, made a number of points, not all",69
NA,strictly related to this Bill. He made some,69
NA,subpoints which I think need greater examina-,69
NA,tion than he has perhaps given them. For,69
NA,"example, he said that he would abolish all",69
NA,university fees and that this would cost,69
NA,"him Slim. All right, that is Slim, but where",69
NA,are one's priorities in terms of education?,69
NA,It is not just one amount.of Slim. It is,69
NA,of Slim or an increasing amount for every,69
NA,year thereafter. If one sets this beside the,69
NA,other things that could be done in support,69
NA,"of education with Slim, I suggest that it is",70
NA,extremely doubtful whether one would give,70
NA,the abolition of university fees complete and,70
NA,absolute priority.,70
NA,I should also like to raise another ques-,70
NA,tion in relation to the abolition of university,70
NA,fees which I tbink I mentioned once before,70
NA,in this House and which representatives of,70
NA,unions in this place might do very well to,70
NA,consider. I tbink it is very widely recognised,70
NA,that whatever advances might be made in,70
NA,education in the future the majority of our,70
NA,population will not be going to universities.,70
NA,An increasing number and an increasing,70
NA,percentage will go to universities and an,70
NA,increasing number and an increasing per-,70
NA,centage will go to colleges of advanced,70
NA,"education. But no country, I think, has",70
NA,achieved a .situation in which a majority,70
NA,of its people of university age do in fact,70
NA,go to a university. What is the justice of,70
NA,taxing the unionist and the average worker,70
NA,"throughout the country, to provide a free",70
NA,"education for a doctor, a lawyer or a",70
NA,"solicitor, who will be going out into the",70
NA,world with professional qualifications enab-,70
NA,ling him to charge fees at an extraordinarily,70
NA,high level-i n a large part a charge on the,70
NA,unionists who are said to be the supporters,70
NA,of the Labor Opposition? I believe that this,70
NA,is a matter which members sitting behind,70
NA,the Leader of the Opposition might do well,70
NA,"to consider, and to see where the true",70
NA,"balance of justice, need and equity lies in",70
NA,relation to this matter. Tt is by no means,70
NA,as simple as the Leader of the Opposition,70
NA,suggests.,70
NA,"He has also said, as I think other speakers",70
NA,"have said, that more scholarships are",70
NA,"needed. Of course, it is always easy to say",70
NA,that more are needed. This is one of the,70
NA,things that the Opposition always can do,70
NA,and it is the Opposition's privilege to be,70
NA,"able to do it. But in saying that, one should",70
NA,not ignore the fact that repeatedly through-,70
NA,out its period in office the Government has,70
NA,increased tbe number of scholarships. It,70
NA,was the Government that first introduced,70
NA,thc Commonwealth scholarship schemes. It,70
NA,"was the Government, when the present",70
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Gorton) was Minister,70
NA,in Charge of Commonwealth Activities in,70
NA,"Education and Research, which did most to",70
NA,broaden our concern for education and,70
NA,"which first did most, to be specific, in",70
NA,"relation to scholarships, to increase the",70
NA,variety of scholarships and their numbers.,70
NA,Advanced education scholarships were,70
NA,introduced in 1966. Secondary scholar-,70
NA,ships and technical scholarships were,70
NA,introduced in 1965. Over the years,70
NA,the number holding scholarships has,70
NA,"increased from a litde under 6,500 to",70
NA,"an estimated 56,500 in 1969, and the num-",70
NA,ber of new scholarships that were available,70
NA,to be awarded in any one year has in-,70
NA,"creased from 3,000 to 24,150. So the",70
NA,Government has given a great deal of atten-,70
NA,tion to these matters. Growing from,70
NA,"nothing, the annua] bill for scholarships will",70
NA,"in a relatively short time rise to $35m, so",70
NA,it cannot be said that the Government has,70
NA,not given a great deal of attention to these,70
NA,"matters-muc h more attention, I believe,",70
NA,than the Opposition might have believed,70
NA,we have in fact given. But still the criticism,70
NA,"comes, as one would expect.",70
NA,I believe that these figures and this per-,70
NA,formance show how unreasonable is the,70
NA,claim of the Leader of the Opposition that,70
NA,we use scholarships to restrict education,70
NA,to an elite. This certainly cannot be said,70
NA,when we look at the numbers of those who,70
NA,are now finding places in universities. There,70
NA,"were 100,000 last year, when the United",70
NA,"Kingdom, with five or six times our popu-",70
NA,"lation, had an objective, according to one",70
NA,"article I read, of about 225,000 university",70
NA,students in 1972-73. The United Kingdom,70
NA,swelled its numbers of university students,70
NA,"by signing over, at one stroke, a number",70
NA,of technological institutions. By signing a,70
NA,piece of paper it called these institutions,70
NA,universities. That is one of the ways in,70
NA,which it achieved a figure much less than,70
NA,ours. It is a case of Australia having per-,70
NA,formed very much better than the United,70
NA,Kingdom in this regard. The Leader of the,70
NA,"Opposition also said, I am advised, that the",70
NA,scholarships do not basically provide assis-,70
NA,tance to those who are in need. Not only,70
NA,do they provide for those who are in need,70
NA,but also that need must be judged on,70
NA,ability. There is no point in providing,70
NA,scholarships to those who have not a reason-,70
NA,able chance and a reasonable opportunity,70
NA,of passing through university without too,70
NA,great a difficulty. This is one of the bases,70
NA,on which the scholarships are in fact made,70
NA,available. The living allowance is provided,70
NA,for those who win scholarships and who,70
NA,are in fact most in need. So the scholarships,70
NA,system does a great deal to assist people who,70
NA,would otherwise not find places in univer-,71
NA,sities. The days are very far gone when,71
NA,one's parents own finances could find one,71
NA,a place at a university irrespective of one's,71
NA,own ability and irrespective of other con-,71
NA,siderations. The able student can get to a,71
NA,"university and, I believe, does.",71
NA,It should be worth noting that either,71
NA,the Martin Report on the Future of Ter-,71
NA,tiary Education in Australia or one of the,71
NA,Australian Universities Commission reports,71
NA,at a time when Sir Leslie Martin was Chair-,71
NA,"man, indicated that one of the bases of",71
NA,judging university entrants should be that,71
NA,students be able to pass through university,71
NA,in minimum time or in minimum time plus,71
NA,one year. In fact not all of those who are,71
NA,awarded Commonwealth scholarships,71
NA,achieve this performance and there are,71
NA,numbers in universities who after some,71
NA,difficulty pass but do so with a greater,71
NA,"time lag than one year. We know, of course,",71
NA,that about one-third of those who do enter,71
NA,universities fail to leave with any degree,71
NA,This merely makes the point tbat we are,71
NA,not restircting entry to universities only to,71
NA,those who can qualify in a minimum time,71
NA,or only to those who can qualify at all.,71
NA,There are sufficient places to enable a great,71
NA,"number of people to go to a university,",71
NA,even though their chances of passing at the,71
NA,bottom level of entrance to universities are,71
NA,not particularly high.,71
NA,The Leader of the Opposition again,71
NA,returned to the old criticism that we do not,71
NA,adopt the Martin Report recommendations,71
NA,on teacher training. Once again he ignored,71
NA,the fact that a great many of those recom-,71
NA,mendations were the particular prerogative,71
NA,"of the States and it was for the States, hav-",71
NA,ing regard to their own administration and,71
NA,"to their own systems, which had the",71
NA,responsibility of giving effect to those,71
NA,recommendations. One of those was that,71
NA,teacher training should be extended to 3,71
NA,years. This is something on which every,71
NA,"State has now acted, but it was the States",71
NA,"which had to make a decision, and they",71
NA,have done so. The same report suggested,71
NA,that the Commonwealth should spend,71
NA,$2.5m on capital facilities for teacher,71
NA,ing matched by a similar sum from the,71
NA,"States. Tn fact, we have spent $24m on",71
NA,"teacher training, or are in the process of",71
NA,spending it. and these are unmatched funds,71
NA,"to provide an additional 5,000 teacher",71
NA,trainee places.,71
NA,The Canberra College of Advanced,71
NA,Education is also actively planning to intro-,71
NA,duce courses in teacher training. So it can-,71
NA,not by any means be said that we have,71
NA,been ignoring this important matter of,71
NA,teacher training. I thought in view of the,71
NA,criticisms that have been made concerning,71
NA,the number of teachers that the House may,71
NA,be interested in the improved pupil-teacher,71
NA,ratios which have occurred over recent,71
NA,times in spite of the fact that there has,71
NA,been an explosive growth in the demand,71
NA,for education caused not so much by a,71
NA,higher number in a particular age group,71
NA,or by immigration as by a much higher,71
NA,percentage of those in the upper years of,71
NA,secondary schooling in the 15 to 18 year,71
NA,old age group seeking to stay at school,71
NA,longer than was once the case. This per-,71
NA,centage over the past 10 years bas risen,71
NA,from about 20% or 22% of the 15 to 18,71
NA,year olds to about 40% last year. I have,71
NA,no doubt that this pressure on the top end,71
NA,-th e expensive end-o f secondary school-,71
NA,ing will continue and that the percentage,71
NA,increase of the age group seeking to end,71
NA,their secondary school will continue.,71
NA,Despite this pressure on the top end of,71
NA,secondary schooling the pupil-teacher ratios,71
NA,broadly have improved even if the improve-,71
NA,ment has not been as rapid as some would,71
NA,"like. For example, in primary schools in",71
NA,Australia the overall ratios have gone from,71
NA,30.2 to I in 1962 to 28.2 to I in 1967.,71
NA,Tn Victoria-an d as a Victorian I am,71
NA,pleased to see that that State leads the,71
NA,field-the ratios have gone from 24.8 to,71
NA,I to 23.7 to 1. If one looks at secondary,71
NA,schools throughout Australia the ratios bave,71
NA,"gone from 20.9 to I to 18.7 to 1, and in",71
NA,New South Wales even with the difficulties,71
NA,of the Wyndham scheme and the extra pres-,71
NA,sure which that put on their secondary,71
NA,school system the ratio has improved from,71
NA,21 to 1 in 1962 to 18.6 to 1 in 1967. So,71
NA,there has been an improvement in pupil-,71
NA,teacher ratios and the combined pro-,71
NA,grammes of the Commonwealth and the,71
NA,States and the assistance that we have,71
NA,train- provided are helping to make this,71
NA,"improvement possible. Having said that, I",71
NA,know it will always be possible to point to,71
NA,a particular school or to a particular dis-,71
NA,cipline and to indicate that there are,71
NA,"shortages in one area or another, but the",71
NA,overall position is better than it once was.,71
NA,I think tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr,72
NA,Whitlam) also mentioned the percentage of,72
NA,gross national product that we spend on,72
NA,education and compared it with the expen-,72
NA,diture of other countries. I would only,72
NA,like to say that my Department has done,72
NA,a great deal of work on these comparisons,72
NA,over the last 6 months and very shortly I,72
NA,will be making available to all honourable,72
NA,members a very detailed paper which will,72
NA,analyse these figures and the considerations,72
NA,that need to be borne in mind when using,72
NA,them as comparisons. They will show that,72
NA,the comparisons are utterly meaningless,72
NA,when comparing the educational effort and,72
NA,the quality of education between one,72
NA,country and another. 1 hope that it will,72
NA,not be more than another week or two,72
NA,before this document will be available to,72
NA,all honourable members who would like to,72
NA,see it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposi-,72
NA,tion ( Mr Barnard) asked one or two specific,72
NA,questions concerning various clauses in the,72
NA,Bill and asked for the difference between,72
NA,the wording used in clauses 11 and 12 con-,72
NA,cerning secondary and technical scholar-,72
NA,"ships. The clauses state that, the regulations",72
NA,will prescribe the funds to be used for a,72
NA,living allowance. It is possible to use the,72
NA,terms that were used in those clauses 11,72
NA,and 12 because for the secondary and,72
NA,technical scholarships the living allowance,72
NA,is $200 and it is the same for everyone.,72
NA,There is no means test on these particular,72
NA,"scholarships, and the amount will, of",72
NA,"course, appear in the regulations. If tbe",72
NA,amount were changed the regulations would,72
NA,be altered. But when one comes to the Com-,72
NA,monwealth university and advanced educa-,72
NA,tion scholarships there is a means test. Some,72
NA,people get the full living allowance and,72
NA,others whose parents have greater means,72
NA,than others will get none. Whilst the living,72
NA,allowance will be awarded in accordance,72
NA,with the regulations they certainly will,72
NA,"be the same for everyone, and it is this",72
NA,difference between the nature of the living,72
NA,allowance and the way in which it is,72
NA,puted and paid which causes the difference,72
NA,in the regulations. I hope that the Deputy,72
NA,Leader of the Opposition will bc able,72
NA,accept that explanation. The honourable,72
NA,member for Angas ( Mr Giles) raised a,72
NA,query about the power of delegation in the,72
NA,"Bill. This is necessary, and by and large it",72
NA,will be a power of delegation to officials,72
NA,in my Department because it is physically,72
NA,quite impossible for the Minister for Educa-,72
NA,"tion and Science annually to award 25,000",72
NA,scholarships. Except for the particular cases,72
NA,where discretion might need to be used or,72
NA,where something is brought to the Minis-,72
NA,ter's notice this is something that the Minis-,72
NA,ter must delegate to his Department.,72
NA,The honourable member for Wills ( Mr,72
NA,Bryant) told me before he spoke that he,72
NA,was going to put forward a plea for a,72
NA,generally broader Commonwealth approach,72
NA,to education and to activities in a wider,72
NA,number of fields. I think the record of the,72
NA,"past, as all honourable members know-",72
NA,and the last 4 or 5 years in particular-wil l,72
NA,indicate that the Commonwealth is spread-,72
NA,ing its interest and concern in a much,72
NA,greater variety of fields than was formerly,72
NA,"the case, and I have no doubt that our",72
NA,concern and increasing involvement in,72
NA,education will continue. The honourable,72
NA,member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) asked,72
NA,why there are only four students undertak-,72
NA,ing study under post-graduate awards in,72
NA,veterinary science-whic h J agree is very,72
NA,"important-whe n there might, for example,",72
NA,be 17 in music. I think he put the point,72
NA,forward that a post-graduate award in,72
NA,veterinary science is more important than,72
NA,a post-graduate award in music. As,72
NA,a farmer I would find it difficult to argue,72
NA,"with him, but these awards may in part",72
NA,reflect the number of people who are study-,72
NA,"ing in a course at the undergraduate level,",72
NA,and so therefore those numbers could affect,72
NA,the number of applications in a particular,72
NA,discipline for a post-graduate award.,72
NA,By and large the greater the number of,72
NA,applicants the greater number there will be,72
NA,of sufficient quality to achieve an award.,72
NA,But I think the honourable member's con-,72
NA,"cern may, to some extent, be alleviated if",72
NA,he keeps in mind that if one looks at agri-,72
NA,"not culture, biochemistry, chemistry, botany",72
NA,and other disciplines of this kind where,72
NA,the numbers of post-graduate awards are,72
NA,"comreally quite great, and when one has in",72
NA,mind also that many of these disciplines,72
NA,cover subjects that are related to veterinary,72
NA,"to science, one sees that much of the post-",72
NA,graduate research work in veterinary,72
NA,science would be done under the name of,72
NA,another discipline. So I think that the posi-,72
NA,tion is not quite as grim as the bare figures,72
NA,on this table might indicate. I would only,72
NA,like to say to the honourable member for,72
NA,Griffith ( Mr Donald Cameron) that the posi-,73
NA,tion of the mature age award holders is,73
NA,"understood. Broadly, the Commonwealth in",73
NA,the past made a judgment that it is better,73
NA,to support those in universities who go,73
NA,through the normal educational stream.,73
NA,But it is recognised that this creates diffiRobinvale,73
NA,culties. Whether anything can be done about,73
NA,"it or not I do not know, but I give the",73
NA,honourable member an assurance that the,73
NA,position of mature age award holders is,73
NA,being very closely examined.,73
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,73
NA,. Bill read a second time.,73

Mr TURNBULL ,Mallee) [10.50]-Wha t tion,73
NA,I have to say tonight may be described as,73
NA,report. It is a report of my journey durthe,73
NA,ing the Easter recess through the Murray,73
NA,Valley from Kerang to Mildura,73
NA,to see atfirsthand the damage inflicted on,73
NA,the dried fruits industry by recent heavy,73
NA,rains. In making the report I want to give,73
NA,certain statistics. I will read the report.,73
NA,During the Easter recess of the Parlia-,73
NA,ment I travelled through the Murray Valley,73
NA,from Kerang to west of Mildura so that I,73
NA,might see the damage caused by the tor-,73
NA,rential rain of a few weeks ago. Greatest,73
NA,loss was experienced by growers of dried,73
NA,"vine fruits, their losses being estimated at",73
NA,from 45% to 50% of the entire crop. When,73
NA,the storm struck most of the fruit had been,73
NA,"picked and was on the racks, where I saw",73
NA,it rotting from the effects of rain. To,73
NA,harvest the fruit that remained on the vine,73
NA,"up to double rates had to be paid to pickers,",73
NA,the remaining crop being too light for them,73
NA,to make reasonable wages at normal rates.,73
NA,In many cases this situation increased sub-,73
NA,stantially the costs of the producer.,73
NA,It is not difficult to imagine the feelings,73
NA,"of growers who, after their year's work,",73
NA,suddenly lost much of the crop on which,73
NA,they depended so heavily. I spoke at meet-,73
NA,ings of growers at Mildura and Woorinen,73
NA,and discussed the problem with others at,73
NA,"and Nyah. I also drove, through",73
NA,the Tresco settlement. I found that financial,73
NA,assistance was urgently needed and that the,73
NA,"Government of Victoria, through its rural",73
NA,"finance office, was inviting growers to state",73
NA,their case to government officers who would,73
NA,operate from central positions to be adver-,73
NA,tised. It is considered that this is the only,73
NA,practical method of assessing the individual,73
NA,and collective loss.,73
NA,It appears that growers can be regarded,73
NA,as being in three categories- a small per-,73
NA,centage who will not requirefinancialassist-,73
NA,ance; a large percentage who require a long,73
NA,term low interest loan if they are to continue,73
NA,satisfactorily in production; and a percentage,73
NA,still to be ascertained who urgently require a,73
NA,liberal grant if they are to survive as primary,73
NA,producers. The Australian vine fruits indus-,73
NA,try is important to those engaged in it and,73
NA,Vietnam to the economy of the nation. The average,73
NA,gross value of dried vine fruit production,73
NA,in Australia for each of the 4 years up to,73
NA,"1966-67 was $30,678,775. Of this produc-",73
NA,"about two-thirds, valued at $20,452,516,",73
NA,a was produced in the Mallee electorate. In,73
NA,4 years to which I have referred the,73
NA,value of fruit exported amounted to,73
NA,"in order $22,121,500 per annum.",73
Mr UREN , I thought the honourable,73
NA,member did not read his speeches.,73
Mr TURNBULL,Thi s is a report. So,73
NA,the value of the industry to Australia may,73
NA,be readily recognised. Dried vine fruit,73
NA,growers were not the only ones to suffer,73
NA,"from the disaster. Growers of citrus, wine",73
NA,"grapes and fresh grapes, producers of seed",73
NA,and other primary producers in the Murray,73
NA,Valley must be given the opportunity to,73
NA,state their .case. The Commonwealth Govern-,73
NA,ment has been alerted to the fact that when,73
NA,accurate figures of the amount of the loss,73
NA,are established it will be expected to give,73
NA,financial aid in conjunction with Victoria so,73
NA,as to ameliorate to some extent at least the,73
NA,desperate financial position of these primary,73
NA,producers.,73
Mr COPE ,Wil l this situation make any,74
NA,difference to the provision of raisins in the,74
NA,parliamentary members' dining room?,74
Mr TURNBULL, I hope not because 1 do,74
NA,am aware that honourable members appreretained,74
NA,"ciate the dried, fruits that have been",74
NA,available. Honourable members are walking,74
NA,and talking advertisements for tbis great,74
NA,industry. They know that dried fruits,74
NA,good for them. They notice the difference,74
NA,in their health after they have had one,74
NA,two meals of dried fruits.,74
NA,On quite a different subject 1 propose to,74
NA,quote from a report published in the member,74
NA,'Sunraysia Daily' on 10th April. The report,74
NA,reads:,74
NA,Ansett Airline's of Australia ' will,74
NA,DC-3's for - its off-peak air services between,74
NA,Melbourne-Mildura-Broken Hill at least until,74
NA,August.,74
NA,The more popular Fokker Friendships will be,74
NA,seen on the Melbourne-Mildflra run only on the,74
NA,services ' which' have departures from Melbourne',74
NA,"each, evening except Saturdays, and from Mel-",74
NA,bourne each morning except Sunday and Monday.,74
NA,DC-3's will be used on the Monday morning,74
NA,Melbourne to Mildura and return service; and on,74
NA,the Wednesday and Friday Melbounic-Mildura-,74
NA,Broken Hill and return services.,74
NA,I have now been informed that the Fokker,74
NA,"Friendship, which is more popular than the",74
NA,"DC3, will be withdrawn from the Mel-",74
NA,bourne to Mildura to Broken Hill run on,74
NA,28th April. The distance from Melbourne to,74
NA,Mildura is 300 air miles and from Mildura,74
NA,to Broken Hill about 200 miles. The,74
NA,people in the areas affected do not want,74
NA,the Friendship to be withdrawn. I appeal to,74
NA,the. Minister for Civil Aviation ( Mr Swartz),74
NA,to look into the matter and to use his,74
NA,influence to see that the Friendship is,74
NA,retained on this important run. Everybody,74
NA,knows that Mildura is one of the great pro-,74
NA,"vincial cities of Australia. Broken Hill,",74
NA,"which is not in the electorate of Mallee, is",74
NA,a very importaut city. On the run from,74
NA,Melbourne to Mildura to Broken Hill and,74
NA,return we should have nothing less than,74
NA,Fokker Friendships. Honourable members,74
NA,who in recent times have travelled from,74
NA,"Melbourne, Sydney or other places to Canadjournment",74
NA,berra in Fokker Friendships have not been,74
NA,satisfied with the aircraft. They have,74
NA,wanted better aircraft. We now have better,74
NA,aircraft on these runs. I have heard a lot,74
NA,of complaints from members of Parliament,74
NA,about the lack of room in a Friendship. On,74
NA,the run from Melbourne through Mildura,74
NA,to Broken Hill we should have aircraft,74
NA,better than the DC3. This is no longer a,74
NA,popular aircraft. Surely it is not asking too,74
NA,much of the Minister for Civil .Aviation lo,74
NA,his utmost to see that the Friendship is,74
NA,on this run. This is surely a very,74
NA,made good paying service and the Friendship,74
NA,should not be withdrawn at. this stage. Air-,74
NA,craft may be getting scarce in Australia but,74
NA,are why should the two great decentralised,74
NA,areas of Mildura and Broken Hill be,74
NA,"or deprived of a service which, they should",74
NA,have and a service,74
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The honourable,74
NA,for Reid will cease interjecting. He,74
NA,has just interjected for the third time in,74
NA,about 3 minutes. If he continues to interject,74
NA,revert to T will have tb deal with him.,74
Mr TURNBULL,W e .know that the,74
NA,honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren).,74
NA,comes from the city. He enjoys the very,74
NA,best of air services between Sydney and,74
NA,Canberra. What does the honourable mem-,74
NA,ber care for the people who Jive in Mildura,74
NA,and Broken Hill? He believes in centralisa-,74
NA,tion. Whenever'we speak in this place -,74
NA,about decentralisation and the improvement,74
NA,of conditions in country areas so that people,74
NA,already living there will hot move to the,74
NA,cities and so that people may be attracted,74
NA,from the; cities to the country honourable,74
NA,members in the ranks of .the Opposition,74
NA,deride our suggestions. Air. services play an,74
NA,important role in taking people from the.,74
NA,cities to the country and from the country,74
NA,to the cities. An adequate air service can,74
NA,make people who live in decentralised areas,74
NA,such as Broken Hill and :Mi)dura feel that,74
NA,they are not completely isolated. I ask the,74
NA,Minister for Civil Aviation to look into this,74
NA,matter and to do what he. can to help the,74
NA,people living in the areas tb which T have,74
NA,referred.. T assure the Minister and all other,74
NA,honourable members that anything done to,74
NA,retain the Friendships will be greatly,74
NA,"appreciated. ', .",74
Mr LUCOCK ,Lyne) [U.0]- 1 want to,74
NA,raise a matter in the House during this,74
NA,debate which concerns one of,74
NA,my constituents. It relates to a matter which,74
NA,comes within the administration of the,74
NA,Department of Health and the Department-,74
NA,of Social Services. This constituent is an,74
NA,age pensioner. He and his wife are in re-,74
NA,ceipt of a pension. They felt that they would,74
NA,join a hospital benefits fund so that in rhe,74
NA,event of illness they could receive better,75
NA,treatment in hospital. In the event of sick-,75
NA,ness they would then be able to go into an,75
NA,intermediate ward. But something which,75
NA,they did not realise was that the moment,75
NA,they joined this hospital benefit fund and,75
NA,received the benefit of treatment in an,75
NA,intermediate ward tbis meant that they,75
NA,penalised themselves in the sense that they,75
NA,did not receive medical expenses on the,75
NA,pensioner medical card. I know that there,75
NA,are complexities in this matter and that it,75
NA,is not an easy problem to solve because of,75
NA,circumstances relating to the pensioner,75
NA,medical card and medical entitlement. But,75
NA,I think that this is a matter which the,75
NA,Minister for Health (Dr Forbes) and the,75
NA,Minister for Social Services ( Mr Wentworth),75
NA,"in consultation with the State Government,",75
NA,could perhaps discuss and reach a solution,75
NA,which would enable the person concerned,75
NA,in these particular circumstances to receive,75
NA,a benefit.,75
NA,The circumstances in this matter are that,75
NA,these people are prepared to help them-,75
NA,"selves, but because they are prepared to",75
NA,do this and to make a contribution out of,75
NA,the money which they receive by way of,75
NA,pension towards paying for the cost of hos-,75
NA,"pital treatment, they are penalised in this",75
NA,way. I do not intend to comment on the,75
NA,charge that was made by the doctor. I know,75
NA,"that doctors do this, and it may be possible",75
NA,that in this particular circumstance the,75
NA,doctor literally made a donation to the,75
NA,people concerned. But the position in this,75
NA,case is that these people were prepared to,75
NA,"help themselves, but because of that they",75
NA,were placed in a position in which they,75
NA,"actually penalised themselves. As I said, I",75
NA,realise that there are complexities in this,75
NA,matter. At this stage when we are consider-,75
NA,"ing the question of health insurance, I hope",75
NA,that the Ministers concerned will look into,75
NA,this matter and see what assistance can be,75
NA,"given, not only in the particular case to",75
NA,"which I have referred, but also in many",75
NA,other cases of which I am aware. I con-,75
NA,"gratulate the Minister for Social Services,",75
NA,the Minister for Health and the two Depart-,75
NA,ments on the great progress that has been,75
NA,made towards providing assistance to these,75
NA,people. I am sure that if the Ministers get,75
NA,together they will be able to find a solution,75
NA,to the problem which will be beneficial to,75
NA,the people concerned.,75
Mr DALY ,Grayndler) [11.3]-- I wish,75
NA,to address a few remarks to the two mat-,75
NA,ters which have been raised by the honour-,75
NA,able member for Mallee ( Mr Turnbull) and,75
NA,by the honourable member for Lyne ( Mr,75
NA,Lucock) and to one or two other matters,75
NA,"which are important to the nation. Firstly,",75
NA,the honourable member for Mallee con-,75
NA,sistently criticises honourable members on,75
NA,both sides of this Parliament for reading,75
NA,"speeches, but tonight I was interested to",75
NA,hear him read an epistle word for word.,75
NA,He repeated it like a parrot in a way for,75
NA,which he is contantly criticising other mem-,75
NA,bers of this Parliament. I congratulate him,75
NA,at least for learning that his read speeches,75
NA,are much better than those which he does,75
NA,not read. I only have this to say about what,75
NA,the honourable member had to say tonight:,75
NA,I thought it was an improvement on his,75
NA,usual speech. I congratulate him for seeing,75
NA,the light and realising that we appreciate,75
NA,it more when he reads something which,75
NA,he obviously knows and understands than,75
NA,we do when he makes a speech off the cuff,75
NA,"without, any knowledge or understanding",75
NA,of the subject with which he is dealing.,75
NA,I should also like to point out that the,75
NA,honourable niember for Mallee never fails,75
NA,to attack the city dwellers of Australia,75
NA,"when he speaks. When all is said and done,",75
NA,five sixths of the Australian population live,75
NA,in the cities of this nation. What do mem-,75
NA,bers of the Liberal Party think about a,75
NA,"member of the Australian Country Party,",75
NA,"one of their colleagues, who consistently",75
NA,attacks people in the cities because they,75
NA,have some of the amenities of life for,75
NA,which they have fought under this Liberal-,75
NA,Country Party Government? Nothing is,75
NA,"given to them. At the same time, the",75
NA,honourable niember for Mallee gives us to,75
NA,understand that it is only the people living,75
NA,in country districts who make the nation,75
NA,go. Where would he be as a Country Party,75
NA,member if city dwellers did not wear suits,75
NA,which were produced from the wool and,75
NA,other products of primary producers?,75
NA,Mr Dohie-D o you wear synthetic suits?,75
Mr DALY,No . Members of the Labor,75
NA,Party do not wear synthetic suits. That is,75
NA,left to members of the Country Party. I,75
NA,mention this to the honourable members in,75
NA,order to show that when he criticises city,75
NA,"dwellers, let it be understood that we eat",75
NA,the bread and wear the suits wbich are,75
NA,produced from the products of primary,75
NA,producers. Ii: every way it is the city,76
NA,"dwellers, who are attacked by the honour-",76
NA,"able member for Mallee, who provide the",76
NA,"wealth of tbe country, because they are",76
NA,consumers representatives. I do not speak,76
NA,tonight as a producer's representative. But,76
NA,let the honourable member for Mallee know,76
NA,that if city dwellers placed a boycott on,76
NA,the products which come from his area,76
NA,there would be a lot of very poor people,76
NA,"in the Mallee electorate. Therefore, when",76
NA,he makes these bitter and well read attacks,76
NA,"on people from city electorates, let him",76
NA,remember that these people make his coun-,76
NA,try district prosperous. Let him remember,76
NA,that these people resent these attacks. To-,76
NA,night when 1 refer to the well read and,76
NA,bitter attacks I am speaking on behalf of,76
NA,the city dwellers who are represented by,76
NA,myself and other members opposite. I hope,76
NA,that members of tbe Country Party will dis-,76
NA,own the honourable member for Mallee for,76
NA,the unwarranted attack which he has made,76
NA,on these people who mean so much to,76
NA,Australia.,76
NA,I know tbat tbe honourable member for,76
NA,Mallee wears nylon socks. If he is not,76
NA,"wearing them, let him prove it. Only",76
NA,recently we heard that wives of graziers,76
NA,favour synthetic materials in preference to,76
NA,woollen materials. I exempt other members,76
NA,"of the Country Party, but I would like",76
NA,to examine very closely all the clothes,76
NA,which the honourable member for Mallee,76
NA,is wearing before 1 accept the fact that he,76
NA,is not wearing any synthetic clothing tonight.,76
NA,"As a matter of fact, when he smiles T think",76
NA,"his smile is synthetic, too. Although there",76
NA,are Shakespeare and other great writers of,76
NA,the past to whom one can refer when,76
NA,"making a speech, when the honourable",76
NA,member for Mallee speaks the only authority,76
NA,on which he relies for verification is the,76
NA,'Sunraysia Daily'. What a magnificent,76
NA,document to refer to. What a great organ,76
NA,of public opinion. I suppose it has a cir-,76
NA,culation of about 55 or 60 in the area in,76
NA,which the honourable member resides.,76
NA,I mention these matters because for a,76
NA,long time in this Parliament I have resented,76
NA,the bitter attacks which have been made by,76
NA,the honourable member for Mallee upon,76
NA,the people whom I represent-th e great city,76
NA,dwellers who provide wealth for the pri-,76
NA,mary producers. I also resent the attacks,76
NA,which he consistently makes on the methods,76
NA,which honourable members use in produc-,76
NA,ing facts and figures from a number of,76
NA,documented notes. Tonight 1 place on,76
NA,record the fact that the honourable mem-,76
NA,ber has seen the light. He has read his,76
NA,speech. His speeches are not much to listen,76
NA,"to at any time, but they are much better",76
NA,when he reads them. Let him continue to do,76
NA,so. Tonight I thought that I should rise in,76
NA,my place and say a few words of rebuke,76
NA,to the honourable member whom I like as,76
NA,"a man, but at the same time I appreciate",76
NA,"that on a lot of matters, he is a long way",76
NA,off the beam. I should like to see a revival,76
NA,of those militant days when he stood and,76
NA,criticised the Government for its inactivity.,76
NA,Today when I see him pandering at the,76
NA,feet of those who maladminister this,76
NA,country I think it is sad to see a retired,76
NA,rebel who is only consoled.by the fact that,76
NA,there is another one who sits in Cabinet,76
NA,and that they have a community of interest,76
NA,"as they think what they were, what they",76
NA,might have been and what they are today.,76
NA,The honourable member for Lyne raised,76
NA,a very important question concerning social,76
NA,services. I think that he has highlighted in,76
NA,this Parliament one of the factors associated,76
NA,with this Government's administration. The,76
NA,anomalies in the social services system are,76
NA,so great that many people are being most,76
NA,unfortunately and unfairly treated. I am,76
NA,pleased to see a member of the Country,76
NA,Party rise tonight and bring to light in this,76
NA,Parliament a matter which Labor members,76
NA,have been raising for some time. J refer to,76
NA,the injustices which are so inherent in the,76
NA,"social services system, and which the",76
NA,Minister for Social Services ( Mr,76
NA,Wentworth) promised to do something,76
NA,about. The case which the honourable,76
NA,member for Lyne raised'tonight could be,76
NA,multiplied one thousand times over. The,76
NA,Government does nothing about it. Even,76
NA,"today, in the face of the Nimmo",76
NA,"Committee's report, the Government is",76
NA,defending a health scheme which is the,76
NA,laughing stock of nations which believe in,76
NA,"social justice, particularly so far as",76
NA,health is concerned. Credit is due to the,76
NA,"honourable member for Lyne, the Deputy",76
NA,"Speaker of this Parliament, for raising this",76
NA,matter which 1 believe should be aired and,76
NA,given the light of day. I hope the Minister,76
NA,for Health (Dr Forbes) and the Minister,76
NA,for Social Services will take notice of this.,76
NA,Members on this side of the House con-,76
NA,tinually bring forward numerous anomalies,76
NA,-hundred s of them-involvin g invalid,77
NA,pensioners and others. There are amazing,77
NA,cases where people are living on discrimin-,77
NA,atory rates of pension simply because they,77
NA,happen to be married. Discrimination,77
NA,occurs right through the whole structure of,77
NA,social services. It is a disgrace that in this,77
NA,enlightened society events should occur,77
NA,such as those mentioned by the honourable,77
NA,member for Lyne tonight. Discrimination,77
NA,also exists between married and single pen-,77
NA,"sioners, those on permissible incomes, the",77
NA,"poor, the very poor and the aged or the",77
NA,frail aged. These discriminations arc a dis-,77
NA,"grace to this Government and to Australia,",77
NA,which is one of the wealthiest countries in,77
NA,the world.,77
NA,I congratulate the honourable member,77
NA,for Lyne for having thc courage to speak,77
NA,"against thi.s Government. After all, it takes",77
NA,a bit of courage to do this. Ask the honour-,77
NA,able member for Warringah ( Mr St. John),77
NA,who is no longer with us-a t least,77
NA,as far as the Liberals are concerned.,77
NA,This is because of the revolution that,77
NA,occurred when he exercised his right as a,77
NA,member of the Liberal Party to express his,77
NA,independent point of view. H is interesting,77
NA,to note what happened after tbe honourable,77
NA,member for Warringah expressed a certain,77
NA,point of view. After the honourable mem-,77
NA,ber for Warringah exercised his right as a,77
NA,"Liberal to speak in his independent way,",77
NA,the honourable member for Parkes ( Mr,77
NA,"Hughes) decided, as he did in the redistri-",77
NA,"bution, that he would move north again",77
NA,and that he would not sit with the honour-,77
NA,able member. So he moved north in the,77
NA,House. I wonder whether the honourable,77
NA,member for Parkes realises thai a loi of,77
NA,honourable members do not like sitting with,77
NA,him but that we cannot all get out.,77
NA,This brings me back to the point made,77
NA,by the honourable member for Lyne. I am,77
NA,pleased that he raised his criticism of thc,77
NA,Government. I am delighted to see that he,77
NA,has exercised certain independence in this,77
NA,"matter. I remind him. though, that Mr",77
NA,Russell of his Party did not have exactly a,77
NA,very pleasant fate when he spoke accord-,77
NA,ingly. So he joins the St. Johns and the,77
NA,Russells.,77
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The honourable,77
NA,member will refer to an honourable mem-,77
NA,ber by the name of his electorate.,77
Mr DALY,"Yes , the honourable mem-",77
NA,ber for Warringah. 1 would like to get back,77
NA,seriously lo the question of social services,77
NA,which has been raised tonight. I point out,77
NA,to the Minister for Health that these,77
NA,injustices are numerous and should be,77
NA,remedied. The Governnient has a responsi-,77
NA,bility to do sc.,77
NA,Having said so much. I express the hope,77
NA,"that after Deceniber of this year, or a little",77
NA,earlier as the Liberals get frightened of,77
NA,"impending by-elections, honourable mem-",77
NA,bers from tbis side of the Parliament will,77
NA,have the opportunity to bring real social,77
NA,justice in health and social services to this,77
NA,country. A Labor Party administration,77
NA,"realises what this country can give, what",77
NA,people are entitled to and what a good go-,77
NA,vernmeni can give them.,77
NA,"Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I wish to",77
NA,make a personal explanation.,77
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! Does the hon-,77
NA,honourable niember claim to have been,77
NA,misrepresented?,77
NA,"Mr TurnlHiH-Yes , I do. You will recall",77
NA,that when I made my contribution tonight,77
NA,I said at the very start that 1 was quoting,77
NA,from a report 1 had written. 1 did not try,77
NA,to make out that I was speaking impromptu,77
NA,or anything like that. The honourable mem-,77
NA,ber for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) never forgets,77
NA,that 1 thrashed him on many occasions.,77
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! The House will,77
NA,come to order.,77
Mr JESS ,La Trobe) [11.14]- I havo,77
NA,been 9 years in this House and I would,77
NA,like to pay a tribute to the late honourable,77
NA,member for East Sydney because since he,77
NA,left this House I do not think the adjourn-,77
NA,"ment debate has been worth anything,",77
NA,"indeed, if a private member has a matte\",77
NA,ro bring up on the adjournment I think ht,77
NA,"nesitates, wondering whether it is wor«>",77
NA,while doing so. There are few opportunities,77
NA,left for private members to raise matters,77
NA,"of importance, and 1 apologise to my con-",77
NA,freres and members of the Opposition for,77
NA,keeping them here at this time.,77
NA,During the last session we listened to,77
NA,many matters of urgency raised by Ihe,77
NA,Opposition. The subject matters have caused,77
NA,us to wonder why the Opposition could not,77
NA,think of matters of more importance to put,77
NA,before (he Parliament and Ihe people of,77
NA,Australia. The matter I wish to raise con-,77
NA,cerns a report which appeared in the Mel-,77
NA,"bourne 'Age' of 12th April, it concerns the",77
NA,recent student demonstrations in Sydney. I,78
NA,would like to read certain extracts. 1 would,78
NA,like these extracts incorporated in Hansard,78
NA,but I do not think I would be given leave,78
NA,so I will not ask for it: The article is,78
NA,"headed: 'Sydney students run riot, seize",78
NA,court'. These are very large headlines. The,78
NA,article is written by Robert Drewe and,78
NA,Andrew Clark. I can read only certain,78
NA,extracts from this article. It says:,78
NA,Students took over the Federal' Attorney-,78
NA,General's office and the Special Federal Court,78
NA,before police flushed them out.,78
NA,1 understand that would be a crime in most criminately,78
NA,societies. I am not sure tbat it is here. The,78
NA,article continues:,78
NA,The demonstration was organised,78
NA,the militant Students for a Democratic,78
NA,Society. . . .,78
NA,"In Adelaide, forty-five students were arrested.",78
NA,Students and police fell to the ground fighting as,78
NA,boots andfistsflew in the melee.,78
NA,It is a fairly lurid report. It continues:,78
NA,SDS and Labor Club university leaders said,78
NA,last night that after yesterday's behaviour,78
NA,there would be no more peaceful demonstrations.,78
NA,One of the ugliest Sydney incidents occurred,78
NA,when a police inspector reached behind Professor,78
NA,Peter Mason (Professor of Physics and Mathematics,78
NA,at Macquarie University) and held him by the coat.,78
NA,Then another policeman hit him,78
NA,It goes on further:,78
NA,"In another incident, four policemen tried to'",78
NA,throw a male student head-first through an open,78
NA,paddy-wagon door. But his right shoulder hit,78
NA,side of the doorway.,78
NA,"Further on, it says:",78
NA,And two policemen dropped a student ihey,78
NA,been carrying face down into the paddy-wagon.,78
NA,"In the majority of the arrests, police twisted",78
NA,"arms, pulled hair and grabbed students by throat",78
NA,and neck before forcing them into the wagon.,78
NA,One begins to get confused as to who were forward,78
NA,"the criminals, who were the police and who sary",78
NA,was on the side of law and order.,78
NA,report continues;,78
NA,The demonstration owed its violence mainly to,78
NA,over-enthusiastic opposition from 500 State police.,78
NA,"They pushed, punched and kicked students,",78
NA,"paper men, and unionists in separate fierce battles",78
NA,outside the Federal Court. . . .,78
NA,The point I am trying to make is that,78
NA,would think that in this country the,78
NA,are the criminals and that the students,78
NA,never commit any offences even if they,78
NA,break into the court or into the Attorneywill,78
NA,General's office. I know that it was not,78
NA,"intended, but one of our major newspapers",78
NA,was purveying the line that in this country,78
NA,the police are the criminals. Two hundred,78
NA,"broke away from tbe main march. Tben,",78
NA,says the report:,78
NA,Two motor cycle policemen and a divisional,78
NA,van tried to get past and stop their,78
NA,progress. . . .,78
NA,Six policemen vainly tried to stop the stampede,78
NA,"by tripping, punching and kicking the",78
NA,demonstrators.,78
NA,I can imagine six policemen in the path of,78
NA,"300 people moving down on them, and I",78
NA,would question to a certain extent the,78
NA,"authenticity of this report, which goes on:",78
NA,More students and trade unionists swelled the,78
NA,"mob and nearly 2,000 occupied Phillip Street.",78
NA,A swathe of thirty fist swinging police indis-,78
NA,punched and kicked demonstrators.,78
NA,This was 30 police against 300. 1 question,78
NA,"by the report as to 2,000. There is an old",78
NA,adage that if a brawl starts anybody who,78
NA,does not want to get involved in it should,78
NA,get out of it. The suggestion that a police-,78
NA,man confronted with such a situation has,78
NA,got to go up to a person and say: 'Pardon,78
NA,"me, Sir, are you in this brawl, or are you",78
NA,not?' is ridiculous. I f he did this 1 think,78
NA,by police he would be king-hit by somebody from,78
NA,the side before he even knew what had,78
NA,happened. The question I ask. is: What is,78
NA,happening in this country? We have this,78
NA,"demonstration in Sydney, we have a demon-",78
NA,"stration on the same day in Adelaide, and",78
NA,we have the same thing happening through-,78
NA,out the capital cities of the world. Not only,78
NA,"the do we have this, but we also have a leading",78
NA,member of the Opposition who I am sure,78
NA,all honourable members opposite will agree,78
NA,had is a potential prime minister reported in,78
NA,the 'Sydney Morning Herald' on the Mon-,78
NA,day following the incident as saying this:,78
NA,"Doctor Cairns, who was a policeman for nearly",78
NA,"10 years, said Sydney police . appeared to look",78
NA,to the prospects of 'bashing up' students.,78
NA,He said New South Wales police used unneces-,78
NA,and at times extreme violence in last Friday's,78
NA,The student demonstration.,78
NA,He went on:,78
NA,"He said today that Brisbane ""policemen had",78
NA,similar attitudes to their Sydney counterparts when,78
NA,newsit came to student protest demonstrations.,78
NA,Dr Cairns said he felt the policemen used the,78
NA,demonstrations to vent their own personal feelings,78
NA,one about lhe students and the war.,78
NA,police He ends up by warning the New South,78
NA,Wales police and Government that unless,78
NA,something is done about police violence they,78
NA,be responsible for any counter-violence.,78
NA,"I do not wish to quote it, but in the Com-",78
NA,munist 'Tribune' one can find articles by the,78
NA,Secretary of the Communist Party in,78
NA,Queensland saying that Communists must,78
NA,suppon this Student Democratic Movement,79
NA,and the Radical Left Movement which cer-,79
NA,tain sections of the Labor Party appear to,79
NA,support. One can also find articles by Mr,79
NA,Michael Hamel-Green about the theory and,79
NA,practice of thc Student New Left. What I,79
NA,am interested in and what I ask Labor,79
NA,members whether they are interested in is,79
NA,what is happening and whether the ordinary,79
NA,common citizen in this country knows what,79
NA,is happening.,79
NA,We were once a peace-loving society. Wc,79
NA,used to be a society that looked to the,79
NA,police to protect our homes and children.,79
NA,When there was trouble we would ring,79
NA,the police. Some clergymen and academics,79
NA,apparently have heroic outlooks when they,79
NA,"are surrounded by a large crowd, but I",79
NA,suggest that if a woman knocked on their,79
NA,door and asked for a postage stamp and they,79
NA,thought they ran any risk they would ring,79
NA,the police post-haste. It seems as though,79
NA,there is a move to depreciate the police; to,79
NA,pull down those who are responsible for,79
NA,upholding the law in this country. I am,79
NA,not attacking the students. They have some,79
NA,grievances. But once they break the law,79
NA,it is beyond what we should tolerate. We,79
NA,all know that many of the young people,79
NA,who get involved in protests are first year,79
NA,university students. They are grasped by the,79
NA,older radicals who are there for a specific,79
NA,purpose. That is why so many fail in their,79
NA,first year at university. But it is clear that,79
NA,we are reaching a position where the,79
NA,bastions of the security of our homes and,79
NA,our way of life are being slowly infiltrated.,79
NA,1 put this question to the House: If what,79
NA,the honourable member for Yarra (Dr J. F.,79
NA,Cairns) says is true why has it not been,79
NA,raised by the Opposition as a matter of,79
NA,urgency? Why has it not been raised by the,79
NA,Australian Labor Party? Or is the honour-,79
NA,able member for Yarra using it as propa-,79
NA,ganda? I f the Government is concerned,79
NA,about the feeling of the people for the,79
NA,and about the situations that the police have,79
NA,"to face, why does it not make a statement",79
NA,about what has occurred? Once the bastions,79
NA,are broken down and once the confidence,79
NA,of the people in the police is taken away,79
NA,there will be trouble. I do not know where,79
NA,the situation will end and I do not think,79
NA,that many honourable members opposite,79
NA,know either. I conclude by quoting from a,79
NA,speech made by Mr Chifley during the coal,79
NA,strike. He said:,79
NA,"Either you forsake the law of the jungle, which",79
NA,"is the Communist creed, and return to the proper",79
NA,and lawful arbitration authority or you ally your-,79
NA,self with a world-wide movement that seeks to,79
NA,wreck the democratic way of life.,79
NA,I know that the majority of the members of,79
NA,"the Australian Labor Party, of the unions",79
NA,and of the Labor movement generally do,79
NA,not condone this attack on thc police. There,79
NA,could bc abuses; probably there are. But,79
NA,an inquiry should be set up by the Govern-,79
NA,"ment to determine who is behind these riots,",79
NA,which often start off as peaceful demonstra-,79
NA,tions. The people of. this country demand,79
NA,and deserve to know. I f we wish to continue,79
NA,the way of life that we have enjoyed in,79
NA,the past it is time that these things were,79
NA,looked at very closely.,79
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne) [11.24]- I,79
NA,do not often inconvenience the House by,79
NA,speaking on the motion for the adjournment,79
NA,"of the House, but I think that something",79
NA,should be said about the current situation in,79
NA,Vietnam. There is no doubt that the,79
NA,Americans are pulling out. There is also no,79
NA,doubt that Australia has no intention of,79
NA,reducing its military forces in Vietnam. The,79
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Gorton) and the Minis-,79
NA,ter for the Army ( Mr Lynch) have con-,79
NA,firmed this. I go back to the 1966 policy,79
NA,speech of the late Rt Hon. Mr Harold,79
NA,"Holt, who said:",79
NA,We seek a peaceful settlement of the conflict,79
NA,through negotiation. But think of the consequ-,79
NA,ences of abandoning our objectives-an d the,79
NA,people of South Vietnam.,79
NA,South Vietnam would become a Communist,79
NA,"state, and the lives and security of millions who",79
NA,have resisted Communism would be in jeopardy.,79
NA,On the strength of that appeal to fear the,79
NA,Government won the last election. But 2 i,79
NA,years have passed since then and the situa-,79
NA,tion has changed dramatically. I read in,79
NA,the Melbourne Press of Friday last that,79
NA,President Nixon proposes to withdraw,79
NA,"50,000 American troops before the end of",79
NA,this year and that that withdrawal will be,79
NA,police followed by the withdrawal of another,79
NA,"100,000, constituting more than 30% of",79
NA,the total American forces in Vietnam. But,79
NA,no final date was announced. I had not,79
NA,seen a final date until I read something,79
NA,"from the pen of James Reston, which",79
NA,appeared in the New York 'Times' last,79
NA,week. He wrote:,79
NA,The strategy of the Nixon Administration is,79
NA,now beginning to come clear.. The indications are,79
NA,that the President has decided to reduce the,79
NA,"level of violence at once in Vietnam, begin with-",79
NA,drawing substantial forces from that conflict by,79
NA,"the end of 1969. and negotiate a ceasefire,",80
NA,promise settlement and complete withdrawal of,80
NA,American troops from that country by the end,80
NA,of 1970 . . .,80
NA,That is about 19 months hence. What is,80
NA,the Australian Government proposing to do,80
NA,in regard to the Australian forces in Viet-,80
NA,nam? ThePrime Minister has said more,80
NA,cautiously than the Minister for the Army,80
NA,that there will be no withdrawal. If 1 can,80
NA,"express lhe views of the Australian people,",80
NA,"I think they would like to know why, if",80
NA,"American troops are to be withdrawn, Aus-",80
NA,tralian troops should not be withdrawn at,80
NA,least proportionately. 1 accept the view of,80
NA,our military advisers that we cannot split,80
NA,"a certain force which, after all, is a small",80
NA,"force or token force of about 8,000. What",80
NA,I want to know is why all the Australian,80
NA,forces cannot be withdrawn from Vietnam,80
NA,"immediately if 150,000 Americans are to be",80
NA,withdrawn by the end of 1970. I have,80
NA,quoted what our late dear friend had to,80
NA,say on this question. But let me tell the,80
NA,House what has been said in the United,80
NA,States.,80
NA,NA,80
Mr CALWELL,Harriman' s view is,80
NA,quoted in an article in a newspaper called,80
NA,"'Broadside', which 1 recommend to honour-",80
NA,able members because I write a fortnightly,80
NA,article in it. Harriman's view is that we,80
NA,"have to negotiate. Roger Hilsman, who was",80
NA,a lesser official in the Kennedy Administra-,80
NA,tion and then in tbe Johnson Administra-,80
NA,"tion, said in a New York radio interview,",80
NA,as reported in tbe Melbourne 'Herald' on,80
NA,25th March last:,80
NA,The Communists can suffer casualties of 10 to,80
NA,] over American losses and still keep going for,80
NA,10 or IS years.,80
NA,litis is a political situation. Only a coalition,80
NA,government in Saigon with Communist,80
NA,representation can succeed.,80
NA,That is completely antipathetic to what this,80
NA,"Government said, through its then Prime",80
NA,"Minister, on the occasion of the 1966 elec-",80
NA,tion campaign. I know that 66% of the,80
NA,people in Australia still support the Govern-,80
NA,"ment policy on conscription, if gallup polls",80
NA,"are to be interpreted rightly, and that 68%",80
NA,of Anglicans interviewed and 68% of,80
NA,Roman Catholics interviewed support it. I,80
NA,thought that all these people who believe,80
NA,in Christ would not want to send people out,80
NA,to be murdered in South Vietnam. What,80
NA,are they doing? Are they trying to out-,80
NA,a com- Herod Herod by killing off the kids in a,80
NA,war for which no person of military age,80
NA,will volunteer? The late Mr Harold Holt,80
NA,said that. He said: 'Our obligations are to,80
NA,Asia and aggression of any kind must be,80
NA,resisted'. He said that the Government had,80
NA,adopted a policy of conscription because,80
NA,there were not sufficient volunteers. There,80
NA,would be no conscripts - in Asia today if,80
NA,those unfortunate people'had the opportun-,80
NA,"ity to refuse to serve, as everybody else of",80
NA,military age in Australia has. What sort of,80
NA,"a cowardly, moronic nation are we when",80
NA,we are prepared to take a section of our,80
NA,20 year olds by drawing marbles from a,80
NA,"barrel, which represents the lottery of",80
NA,"death, and send them out to kill or be",80
NA,killed in order to . preserve a capitalist,80
NA,society here? This is the whole story. The,80
NA,Americans are getting out and we ought to,80
NA,be getting out. Had I become Prime,80
NA,Minister in 1966-an d I . do not care who,80
NA,has been running under my neck since or,80
NA,"who ran under it before,- but I speak",80
NA,honestly about what I-intended to do- I,80
NA,intended to bring every Australian soldier,80
NA,"out of Vietnam by Easter 1967, not Easter",80
NA,"1969, 2 years later. I hopethat I will be",80
NA,justified on that point as I have been justi-,80
NA,fied on a lot of other things that I said at,80
NA,that time. I feel very keenly about this. We,80
NA,have 307 dead in Vietnam-hal f of,80
NA,"them conscripts, people who never wanted",80
NA,to go at all'. And all the others that are,80
NA,there should never have been sent.,80
NA,I do not believe in Australian involvement,80
NA,in any Asian war. I did not want to see,80
NA,"troops stationed in Malaysia, and we op-",80
NA,posed that proposal at the time. I think it,80
NA,is ridiculous to suggest now that we will,80
NA,not put troops into Malaysia but will put in,80
NA,Air Force and Navy units instead. The,80
NA,policy that Australia should pursue is to,80
NA,render economic and social aid to Asia and,80
NA,to keep out of every filthy Asian war in,80
NA,future. This war is an undeclared war-,80
NA,an unprincipled war. It is an unwinnable,80
NA,civil war.,80
NA,Mr Cleaver-I t is not.,80
Mr CALWELL,I t is. Harriman said it,80
NA,is unwinnable and so did Roger Hilsman.,80
NA,"President Nixon and his administration, by",80
NA,the fact that they are preparing to evacuate,80
NA,"American forces from Vietnam, recognise",80
NA,that it is unwinnable. It was President,80
NA,"Johnson who said: 'It is a cruel, dirty war'.",80
NA,"Worse than that, it is a filthy, bloody, rotten",81
NA,war and Australia should not be involved,81
NA,in any of these things. If we sow the,81
NA,dragon's teeth our children and our child-,81
NA,ren's children will reap the whirlwind. We,81
NA,are throwing sops to Cerberus. It reminds,81
NA,me of the story of the Russian Czar who,81
NA,tried to save himself by throwing child,81
NA,after child out to the wolves. We cannot,81
NA,"afford to do that and, in all honesty, if we",81
NA,are real democrats we will leave the people,81
NA,"of Asia, whatever country they live in, to",81
NA,solve their own problems according to their,81
NA,lights. My philosophy has always been Asia,81
NA,for the Asians and Australia for the,81
NA,Australians.,81
Dr MACKAY ,Evans) [11.33]-I n,81
NA,listening to the right honourable member,81
NA,"for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who has just",81
NA,"spoken, one sometimes wonders whether he",81
NA,reads the daily Press and what his attitude,81
NA,is to the hundreds of children who have,81
NA,been slaughtered by the Vietcong during,81
NA,the last few months when the. bombing of,81
NA,North Vietnam has been ceased and unverting,81
NA,protected towns and villages have been,81
NA,wantonly subjected to attack without whose,81
NA,discrimination.,81
Mr SPEAKER,Order ! I would remind ing,81
NA,all honourable gentlemen that interjections,81
NA,are out of order. It is becoming far too,81
NA,prevalent in this House for members who,81
NA,have spoken in debate to endeavour to have be attacked.,81
NA,a cross-fire exchange across the House. I,81
NA,tell honourable members that this position,81
NA,will not be tolerated by the Chair.,81
Dr MACKAY,Th e subject on which I,81
NA,wish to speak is the same as that which,81
NA,the honourable member for La Trobe ( Mr,81
NA,Jess) raised. I believe it to be a most,81
NA,tant matter confronting tbis nation inside,81
NA,its own borders. I refer to the development,81
NA,which is taking place in and around,81
NA,"through the protest movement. Mark you,",81
NA,I am not attacking the protest movement,81
NA,"itself, because the right to protest is a sacred",81
NA,right indeed in a democratic society. It is,81
NA,right that is not enjoyed in half of,81
NA,"world today, and it is a right which carries",81
NA,with it a great responsibility. I believe that,81
NA,there is in Australia today demonstrably,81
NA,obviously a conspiracy to subvert our youth,81
NA,"from allegience to the nation, its traditions",81
NA,and its constitutional forms of government.,81
NA,This is being done in a way which is not majority.,81
NA,a genuine political movement but is the,81
NA,"exploitation of political, religious and social",81
NA,attitudes among youth by extremist revolu-,81
NA,tionary forces. I believe that these forces,81
NA,are not concerned with the issues which are,81
NA,paraded as the apparent motives for the,81
NA,demonstrations. I believe that they have,81
NA,nothing to do with Vietnam as such or,81
NA,"conscription as such. Indeed, documents",81
NA,which can be produced and tabled emanat-,81
NA,ing from these sources show that such,81
NA,forces freely talk about the days after the,81
NA,"Vietnam struggle is over, and of how their",81
NA,organisation will be retained intact so that,81
NA,they will be able to continue their activities.,81
NA,Today amongst our student body there,81
NA,"are those who are more, concerned with",81
NA,"their orientation, enlistment and induction",81
NA,into a process which has little or nothing,81
NA,to do with political forms and institutions,81
NA,which we have built up in this country,81
NA,than they are with their education. These,81
NA,"forces, which are often much to the left of",81
NA,"the Communist Party, are seducing and sub-",81
NA,our young people aided and abetted,81
NA,"by misguided academics, clerics and others",81
NA,positions give them special privileges,81
NA,in the community. The method of destroy-,81
NA,ing our community includes the undermin-,81
NA,of natural and constituted authority. As,81
NA,the honourable member for La Trobe has,81
NA,"pointed out, the police force in particular",81
NA,is singled out as one of the authorities to,81
NA,Some little time ago in this chamber the,81
NA,Attorney-General ( Mr Bowen) drew atten-,81
NA,tion to a very important reorganisation of,81
NA,the forces of the left that were to set out,81
NA,on this course. Immediately following the,81
NA,last Federal election in 1967 a conference,81
NA,imporwas held over the Australia Day weekend.,81
NA,This most important cenference laid down,81
NA,guidelines and the beginnings of many of,81
NA,and the movements which have blossomed,81
NA,"since, particularly among .the youth of the",81
NA,church and other bodies in the community.,81
NA,Many interesting discussions were held and,81
NA,a many interesting decisions were taken. For,81
NA,"the instance, one group recommended to the",81
NA,general committee of the conference a split-,81
NA,ting up into groups to train for and discuss,81
NA,and civil disobedience. A move was made to,81
NA,recommend that acts of civil-disobedience,81
NA,"be kept separate from mass demonstrations,",81
NA,but this move was defeated by a large,81
NA,In discussing the situation of young,82
NA,"people in the community, particular atten-",82
NA,tion was paid to the schools. It was said,82
NA,that because of the introduction of a sixth,82
NA,year in high schools by the Wyndham,82
NA,"scheme, the older and more mature students",82
NA,offered great possibilities for organisation,82
NA,in the high schools and the setting up of an,82
NA,ami-war underground news sheet. Other,82
NA,methods of bringing youth into the move-,82
NA,ment were then formulated. The conference,82
NA,was set up by a body known then as the,82
NA,Vietnam Action Commiitee. Later it,82
NA,changed its name to the Vietnam Action,82
NA,"Campaign. Arising out of the conference, a",82
NA,number of other movements were formed.,82
NA,"For instance, in Victoria the Vietnam Co-",82
NA,ordinating Committee came into existence.,82
NA,After setting up its headquarters in Park-,82
NA,villc it set out to become the body which,82
NA,"would, in its own words, be concerned with",82
NA,thc role of organisation .of demonstrations.,82
NA,The Vietnam Co-ordinating Committee has,82
NA,"an interesting list of office, bearers but I",82
NA,will noi weary honourable members by,82
NA,"reading their names. However, 1 trust that",82
NA,all honourable members will direct their,82
NA,attention to the kind of information which,82
NA,was made available.,82
NA,I wish to quote from a newsletter sent,82
NA,out by the Vietnam Co-ordinating Com-,82
NA,mittee. It slates:,82
NA,The October 23 demonstration,82
NA,described as one of Ihe most violent demonstra-,82
NA,tions Melbourne has ever seen. The police have,82
NA,"accused thc organisers, the Vietnam Co-ordinating",82
NA,"Committee, of going back on their word. The",82
NA,"Vietnam Co-ordinating Committee, organising thc",82
NA,"demonstration, wish to present their version.",82
NA,It goes on lo discuss the way in which mem-,82
NA,bers of the organisation say that they have,82
NA,tried to co-operate with the police but have,82
NA,found that it does not work. It states:,82
NA,The police say one thing and do another. They,82
NA,"obviously prefer to push us around, rather than",82
NA,co-operate wilh us.,82
NA,We are. not going to be pushed around any,82
NA,more. To prevent violence and disorder in future,82
NA,demonstrations the Vietnam Co-ordinating Com-,82
NA,mittee will provide ils own police force and will,82
NA,request Ihe regular police to keep clear of,82
NA,demonstrators.,82
NA,Then the whole situation is made ludicrous,82
NA,because in the very same report there is,82
NA,another statement which completely contra-,82
NA,dicts the charge that the police had gone,82
NA,back on their undertaking to the organisers,82
NA,of the demonstration. I. quote another part,82
NA,of the report which says:,82
NA,The more or less spontaneous deviations from,82
NA,plan at the last two major marches can never bs,82
NA,accomplished with the same degree of success,82
NA,again. The police have contingency plans now,82
NA,and we must adjust our organisation accordingly.,82
NA,So the thing is taking place in our midst,82
NA,which is giving rise to a plethora of,82
NA,organisations of many names such as,82
NA,the Society for Democratic Action and,82
NA,Students for Democratic Society. But,82
NA,some of their decisions and some of the,82
NA,resolutions which have been taken at these,82
NA,meetings are most revealing with regard to,82
NA,the matter brought up by the honourable,82
NA,member for La Trobe. I quote again. One,82
NA,speaker insisted that:,82
NA,. . . to be worthwhile demonstrations should be,82
NA,made up of large numbers of people with a,82
NA,hard core using things like smoke bombs and,82
NA,rocks to attack the police. The rest should confuse,82
NA,and hinder the police with passive resistance,82
NA,tactics ancl so provoke them into violent action.,82
NA,"This way maximum publicity was obtained, which",82
NA,"was the prime aim of demonstrations. However,",82
NA,at all times the police should be goaded into,82
NA,taking the first violent action.,82
NA,This is in keeping with other material that,82
NA,we find even in the decisions of the World,82
NA,Council of Churches at its fourth assembly,82
NA,in Upsala. It has given its own blessing to,82
NA,the use of force and use of violence iu,82
NA,"revolution. This was, it said, morally",82
NA,ambiguous and something which could be,82
NA,employed even as soon as the forces of,82
NA,has been law and order began to use violence in,82
NA,withstanding the forces of change.,82
NA,I conc.ude by saying that the method of,82
NA,destroying our community includes the,82
NA,undermining of all natural and constituted,82
NA,"authorities in the home, the parents, the",82
NA,"law, the police force, the Government, the",82
NA,school or university authorities. These are,82
NA,not opinions. They are facts that can be,82
NA,supported by publicly available informa-,82
NA,tion coming from these organisations. I,82
NA,believe that they are facts which could .be,82
NA,sustained before a royal commission or,82
NA,other inquiry. I believe thai it is encumbent,82
NA,upon the Government to set forth before,82
NA,very long for the Australian people to see,82
NA,the pattern of what is being done to enlist,82
NA,our young people in the same kind of,82
NA,violence that is being seen right across the,82
NA,"free world and which, when it is attempted",82
NA,"in a demonstration in Czechoslovakia, is",82
NA,immediately clamped down on by the ruling,82
NA,authorities there. The demonstrations are,82
NA,"not to bc stopped, but the kind of ex-",82
NA,ploitation of the adventurous spirit of youth,82
NA,and its desire for change which is seen on,83
NA,these occasions is something which is foreign,83
NA,and inimical to the interest of Australia.,83
Mr UREN ,Reid) [11.43]-Th e honour-,83
NA,able member for La Trobe ( Mr Jess) asked,83
NA,what has been happening in this country.,83
NA,What has been happening to the young,83
NA,people in this country cannot be divorced,83
NA,from what the right honourable member,83
NA,"for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) said, because",83
NA,the students and young people of this coun-,83
NA,try are disturbed about the conscripting of,83
NA,young men for overseas military service and,83
NA,for Australia's involvement in the Vietnam,83
NA,war. The right honourable member for,83
NA,Melbourne explained that you cannot,83
NA,divorce one from the other. This is why,83
NA,the young people of this country are dis-,83
NA,turbed. They are disturbed because only a,83
NA,few selected young men of this nation are,83
NA,being conscripted and then being forced by,83
NA,men in this Parliament who are of military,83
NA,age themselves and by many who are old,83
NA,"men to go overseas to an unpopular war,",83
NA,"a vicious war, and a cruel war that has",83
NA,been decried and condemned by the,83
NA,majority of the nations of the world. The,83
NA,United States of America has stood prac-,83
NA,tically alone because it could not get other,83
NA,countries to join it in Vietnam.,83
NA,The honourable member for La Trobe,83
NA,seems to think that there is something,83
NA,unhealthy about the fact that the students,83
NA,of Australia are disturbed about and are,83
NA,demonstrating against this war. Everybody,83
NA,who has studied this question knows that,83
NA,university students on the whole set out on,83
NA,peaceful demonstrations. These university,83
NA,students march in peaceful demonstrations.,83
NA,The speakers who address them prior to,83
NA,their going out on a demonstration call for,83
NA,a non-violent approach. The leaders of,83
NA,these demonstrations emphasise that they,83
NA,should be non-violent demonstrations.,83
NA,But we know that in all movements there,83
NA,are minorities who will try to do something,83
NA,unusual and who will try to make the head-,83
NA,lines. But surely the police should be,83
NA,intelligent. The police should be able to,83
NA,understand and to deal with this very small,83
NA,minority. If the police are not experienced,83
NA,"by now, all I say is that if they go on with",83
NA,the violence and brutality with which they,83
NA,are going on and with which they went on,83
NA,"last week in the demonstrations in Sydney,",83
NA,there will be a bloody war and we will see,83
NA,blood running in the streets of Sydney. I,83
NA,make it quite clear to all honourable mem-,83
NA,bers that I have always advocated the non-,83
NA,violent approach in demonstrations. 1 have,83
NA,stressed and over-stressed always the fact,83
NA,that when we have demonstrated against,83
NA,the Vietnam war we have stood for negotia-,83
NA,tions for a peaceful settlement. That war,83
NA,must be settled by negotiation. This has,83
NA,always been the view of the great bulk of,83
NA,the Australian peace movement and the,83
NA,great bulk of the student movement who,83
NA,have demonstrated against this war. This is,83
NA,what is happening in this country.,83
NA,Do honourable members on the Govern-,83
NA,ment side know that people acting in,83
NA,accordance with theirconsciences are pre-,83
NA,pared to go to gaol because of the blunder-,83
NA,ing stupidity of the Government? Through,83
NA,this stupidity the Government is condemn-,83
NA,ing them to 2 years in gaol because of their,83
NA,courage and their convictions against a,83
NA,particular war to which they have a con-,83
NA,scientious objection. Are the newspapers,83
NA,"right in what they say? For instance, Ian",83
NA,Fitchett wrote in the 'Sydney Morning,83
NA,Herald' earlier this week-i f he is right-,83
NA,that the Minister for Labour and National,83
NA,Service ( Mr Bury) brought recommenda-,83
NA,tions from his Department to Cabinet seek-,83
NA,ing to exclude from military services those,83
NA,who were conscientious objectors against a,83
NA,particular war. That war is the Vietnam war.,83
NA,The proposal was that they would be,83
NA,excluded from military service and should,83
NA,"undertake special service. But no, the hard",83
NA,"liners, the conservatives and the stupid",83
NA,blunderers in this Government have con-,83
NA,tinued to say no. They say: 'We are going,83
NA,"to make sure that, unless people go to the",83
NA,war in Vietnam they will be put in gaol,83
NA,with criminals and others for 2 years'. The,83
NA,men of conscience-mer i like Bill White,83
NA,and Simon Townsend-a s far as I am con-,83
NA,cerned will be the great men of our age.,83
NA,Mr Calwell-Joh n Zarb too.,83
Mr UREN,"An d John Zarb too, as the",83
NA,right honourable member for Melbourne,83
NA,points out. These men are men of con-,83
NA,"science and men of courage. Therefore, we",83
NA,must realise why these demonstrations are,83
NA,going on. It is all right for the honourable,83
NA,"member for Evans (Dr Mackay), 'that holy",83
NA,"gentleman, that godly man', to talk about",83
NA,the students in Czechoslovakia. I applaud,83
NA,the students in Czechoslovakia who are,83
NA,demonstrating against the oppression that is,83
NA,being suffered there. This morning's Ausand,84
NA,tralian newspapers told how the students,84
NA,refused to go to their classes. What did streets of Sydney.,84
NA,they do? They had a teach-in in their uni-,84
NA,"versities in Prague, Czechoslovakia. There",84
NA,are students demonstrating m Spain against,84
NA,the brutality of Fascism. We should be,84
NA,proud of them just as we should be,84
NA,proud of all students who have the courage,84
NA,to stand up against unjust laws. Throughout,84
NA,"history great men such as Christ, Gandhi,",84
NA,Nehru and Niemoller have stood up against,84
NA,the law of the land. But they stood up,84
NA,against unjust laws. We should be proud,84
NA,"of the young men in this country who have Allan,",84
NA,"the courage to demonstrate peacefully Bonnett, R. N .",84
NA,"against the unjust laws of this Government Bowen,",84
NA,and against the stupidity of this GovernCameron.,84
NA,"ment in continuing to conscript our youth Chaney, F. C.",84
NA,for overseas military service.,84
NA,"In the time that is left to me I want to Dobie,",84
NA,"deal with brutality which I saw with my Erwin, G. D.",84
NA,"own eyes. I did not need to read about this Fairbairn,",84
NA,"in the newspapers. I do not encourage Forbes,",84
NA,young men to break the law or to go into Gibbs. W. T.,84
NA,"the office of the Attorney-General to demonHolten, R. M .",84
NA,"strate. As a matter of fact of all the -MinisHughes,",84
NA,"ters on the Treasury bench I believe the Hulme, A. S.",84
NA,"Attorney-General is the most liberal,",84
NA,"and there is some hope for a man such Arthur, W. T.",84
NA,"as he. We should understand that these Beazley, K. E.",84
NA,"young men demonstrate because they want Cairns, J. F.",84
NA,"to make sure that their presence is felt. Calder, S. E.",84
NA,"Last Monday I wrote a letter to the 'AusCope,",84
NA,"tralian' about the following incident. At Crean,",84
NA,"5.30 I was walking through Chifley Square Daly, F. M .",84
NA,"in Sydney to pick up my car. In front of Giles,",84
NA,"the Qantas building there were more policeHayden, W. G. B.",84
NA,men than demonstrators. The police had the,84
NA,"demonstrators hemmed in in front of Gorton, J. G.",84
NA,Qantas House. They were extended for MCEwen.,84
NA,"about 15 or 20 yards in front of the WentTurner, H. B.",84
NA,worth Hotel where there was a conference Graham.,84
NA,"of international bankers. I saw a group of Killen, D. J.",84
NA,"brutal sadists, witb Fascist mentality- I Freeth, G.",84
NA,use that term advisedly-youn g thugs with Lynch.,84
NA,"police uniforms on, barging in amongst Bosman. L. L.",84
NA,"young students to push them back. I was Buchanan, A. A.",84
NA,"disturbed because many of these people Gibson,",84
NA,were pacifists. They were Quakers; they Adermann. C. F.,84
NA,"were non-violent people. The police made Robinson, I . L .",84
NA,a brutal approach and showed a good deal,84
NA,of antagonism. They had no understanding,84
NA,of what was going on. Unless the New South,84

NA,"House adjourned at 12.1 a.m. (Thursday),",84
NA,The following answers to questions,85
NA,Cost of Electricity,85
NA,(Question No. 1098),85
Mr WHITLAM , the Minister for the,85
NA,"Interior, upon notice:",85
NA,How does the cost of electricity in Canberra,85
NA,compare with its cost in the twenty largest pro-,85
NA,vincial cities in Australia?,85
NA,Mr Nixori-Th e answer to the honour-,85
NA,able member's question is as follows:,85
NA,It is difficult to make a direct comparison of,85
NA,costs because of the different forms of tariffs used,85
NA,by the various supply authorities. They differ not,85
NA,only for different consumer classes but also to,85
NA,"suit' population habits, climatic conditions, times",85
NA,and even rates of usage. Tariffs are also usually,85
NA,"promotional, that is, the more that is used, the",85
NA,"lower the unit cost. Therefore overall comparisons,",85
NA,except in regard to specific instances may be,85
NA,misleading.,85
NA,It is felt that probably the most realistic way,85
NA,in which to provide the information sought is to,85
NA,show the average return per umt'sold. This is done,85
NA,"in the following table, both for domestic consumers",85
NA,and consumers overall.,85

NA,1. As yet I have not received any requests or,87
NA,suggestions from any Minister who attended the,87

NA,"Minister regretting that,' due to parliamentary",87
NA,"Pensions commitments in Canberra on 19th March, I would",87
NA,be unable to make any appearance at the Con-,87
NA,ference in Melbourne on that day. Although I was,87

NA,Mr Bowen-Th e answer to the honour-,87
NA,member's question is as follows:,87
NA,"1 and 2. It is possible for the High Court, if it",87
NA,"is so inclined, to give a decision on the meaning",87
NA,of section 92 of the Constitution that is incon-,87

NA,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,10
Mr HAWKE ,Wills-Prime Minister)-I,10
NA,inform the House that the Minister for Sci-,10
NA,"ence, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry",10
NA,"Jones, left Australia on 3 March to attend",10
NA,an environmental conference and for associ-,10
NA,ated discussions in London. He will return,10
NA,"to Australia on 15 March. In his absence,",10
NA,"the Minister for Industry, Technology and",10
NA,"Commerce, Senator Button, has assumed Mr",10
NA,Jones's portfolio duties and the Minister for,10
NA,"Trade Negotiations, Mr Duffy, is represent-",10
NA,ing the Minister in this chamber.,10
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,10
NA,DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT AND,10
NA,COMMUNICATIONS: SALE OF,10
NA,AIRCRAFT,10
Mr BLUNT,My question is directed to,10
NA,the Minister for Transport and Communica-,10
NA,tions. Was an F28 aircraft owned by the,10
NA,Minister's Department disposed of without,10
NA,public tender? Was this aircraft acquired by,10
NA,a company of the Ansett group and was it,10
NA,immediately resold overseas for a profit of,10
NA,millions of dollars? Did the procedure,10
NA,adopted by the Department for this sale,10
NA,comply with the finance regulations of the,10
NA,Department of Administrative Services? If,10
NA,"not, why not?",10
Mr WILLIS,I suggest that the honour-,10
NA,able member put the question on notice.,10
NA,WAGE-TAX TRADE-OFF,10
Mr MOUNTFORD,Can the Prime Min-,10
NA,ister advise the House of the principles being,10
NA,used to determine the Government's ap-,10
NA,proach to the wage-tax trade-off in the forth-,10
NA,coming April economic statement?,10
Mr HAWKE,The tax cuts that my Gov-,10
NA,ernment will provide from 1 July will recog-,10
NA,"nise that those in receipt of average, or",10
NA,"around average, earnings have borne the",10
NA,greater part of the burden of restraint. In,10
NA,"the event, our tax cuts will be concentrated",10
NA,on low to moderate income earners because,10
NA,it is the case that they have earned the tax,10
NA,cuts and they will get them. We will provide,10
NA,those tax cuts in the context of an econom-,10
NA,ically responsible wage-tax trade-off. In ex-,10
NA,plaining that tax cut in the context of our,10
NA,"economic responsibility, I say it is well known",10
NA,that that sort of economic responsibility is,10
NA,not a strong suit of those opposite. We see,10
NA,that honourable members opposite are now,10
NA,contemplating trying to slide out of detailing,10
NA,the spending cuts that they would make to,10
NA,fund their tax cuts. One could well ask who,10
NA,said this of the coalition's tax policy:,10
NA,I have said all along that the timetable for policy,10
NA,release is by August 1988 ... is going to be adhered,10
NA,to.,10
NA,That was said by the Leader of the Opposi-,10
NA,tion. As against what is happening on the,10
NA,"Opposition's side, it is well known that this",10
NA,Government has never shirked the responsi-,10
NA,bility of explaining to the Australian com-,10
NA,munity just where the money to finance tax,10
NA,"cuts is coming from. In that context, Madam",10
NA,"Speaker, you could well ask who, in a con-",10
NA,fidential memo to the preceding Leader of,10
NA,"the Opposition, the honourable member for",10
NA,"Kooyong, said:",10
NA,We will be very vulnerable if Labor can successfully,10
NA,put the tag of 'Where's the money coming from' on,10
NA,our election offerings.,10
NA,That was what the honourable member for,10
NA,Bennelong said to the then Leader of the,10
NA,Opposition: that they would be vulnerable if,10
NA,they could not say where the money was,10
NA,coming from. I say to the honourable mem-,10
NA,"ber for Banks, and through him and the",10
NA,House to the Australian community: The,10
NA,community will be left in no doubt-as far,10
NA,as we are concerned on this side of the,10
NA,House-as to where the money is coming,10
NA,from to finance the tax cuts of this Govern-,10
NA,"ment. What you will find on the other side,",11
NA,"Madam Speaker, is no indication whatsoever",11
NA,at this stage. Now there is an indication that,11
NA,the Opposition will slide out of that respon-,11
NA,sibility altogether.,11
NA,"Finally, I ask this House to contrast what",11
NA,is said in 'Futile Diversions' on this score. In,11
NA,'Futile Diversions' on page 3 the Leader of,11
NA,the Opposition said:,11
NA,. . . politicians . . . have glossed over the,11
NA,truth when it has been too difficult for them to cope,11
NA,with its consequences and made unrealistic promises,11
NA,which have built up false expectations of what can,11
NA,be achieved.,11
NA,What we are witnessing at this stage in re-,11
NA,gard to the Opposition's so-called tax and,11
NA,fiscal policy is exactly described by the,11
NA,Leader of the Opposition's own statement on,11
NA,"page 3. As we go through this year, Madam",11
NA,"Speaker, you will continue to see this con-",11
NA,trast: absolutely explicit indications by this,11
NA,side of the House as to where the tax cuts,11
NA,will be coming from; as far as the Opposition,11
NA,"is concerned, no indication whatsoever.",11
NA,INFLATION,11
NA,NA,11
NA,the Treasurer. I remind him that on 9 Sep-,11
NA,tember last he said in an address to the,11
NA,Economic Planning Advisory Council:,11
NA,The wage/tax trade-off we will implement will,11
NA,secure a further fall in inflation to around three,11
NA,four per cent in 1990.,11
NA,Does the Treasurer still stand by this predic-,11
NA,"tion? If not, what is his revised assumption",11
NA,for inflation for the calculation of the For-,11
NA,ward Estimates for next year?,11
Mr KEATING,I addressed all these,11
NA,matters publicly a couple of weeks ago in a,11
NA,press conference-which I have and the,11
NA,honourable member does not have.,11
Mr TUCKEY ,What about the Parliament?,11
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The honourable,11
NA,member for O'Connor will not interject.,11
Mr TUCKEY ,We don't want to know what,11
NA,he said out there.,11
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! The honour-,11
NA,able member for O'Connor will not argue,11
NA,with the Chair.,11
Mr KEATING,I refer the honourable,11
NA,gentleman to the transcript.,11
NA,SOVIET DIPLOMAT,11
NA,Mr BILNEYI direct my question to the,11
NA,Prime Minister. I refer to the rather feverish,11
NA,allegations by the shadow Minister for for-,11
NA,eign affairs about our policy towards· the,11
NA,"Soviet Union. Is it the case, as alleged by",11
NA,"the shadow Minister, that our policies to-",11
NA,wards the Soviet Union have been influenced,11
NA,in any way by the alleged clandestine activi-,11
NA,ties of Mr Valery Zemskov?,11
Mr HAWKE,I am indebted to the,11
NA,honourable member for this question. It is,11
NA,"well established practice, not only under this",11
NA,Government but under all preceding govern-,11
NA,"ments, that the Government does not com-",11
NA,"ment on security and intelligence matters,",11
NA,and I do not intend to depart from that,11
NA,"practice. Within that constraint there are,",11
NA,"however, some aspects of the allegations",11
NA,made by the shadow Minister for foreign,11
NA,affairs on which I am able to comment and,11
NA,which should not be allowed to pass without,11
NA,comment. The allegations made in the media,11
NA,release of 3 March by the shadow Minister,11
NA,"are amongst the most shabby, despicable and",11
NA,unsubstantiated to have come from the Op-,11
NA,"position in recent memory. In particular, they",11
NA,represent a grossly unfair attack upon a par-,11
NA,ticular Australian official who has served and,11
NA,continued to serve his country with diligence,11
NA,and with dedication. The unambiguous pur-,11
NA,to port of the shadow Minister's media release,11
NA,is that there was a sinister relationship be-,11
NA,tween Mr Hayden's former principal private,11
NA,"secretary, who is now an acting deputy sec-",11
NA,retary in the Department of Foreign Affairs,11
NA,"and Trade, Mr Michael Costello, and the",11
NA,Soviet official.,11
Mr SPENDER ,Do I have to sit here and,11
NA,listen to this man misrepresent me? The,11
NA,Prime Minister is misrepresenting what I have,11
NA,said.,11
NA,Madam SPEAKER-If the Prime Minis-,11
NA,ter is misrepresenting anyone the honourable,11
NA,member will have a chance by way of per-,11
NA,sonal explanation to reply.,11
Mr SINCLAIR ,"I rise on a point of order,",11
NA,Madam Speaker. Under our Standing Orders,11
NA,"it is not in order for one member, be he the",11
NA,"Prime Minister or anyone else, to make· any",11
NA,sort of an inference against another member,11
NA,unless on a substantive motion. The sugges-,11
NA,tion just made by the Prime Minister that,11
NA,there was something sinister in a press,12
NA,lease suggests that the honourable,12
NA,for North Sydney had entirely improper mo-,12
NA,"tives. I would put it to you, Madam Speaker,",12
NA,that the nature of that response by the Prime,12
NA,Minister is entirely out of the bounds of our,12
NA,Standing Orders and I suggest he either withDepartment,12
NA,draw the remark or rephrase his answer.,12
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The Prime Minister that,12
NA,will take note of the standing order which,12
NA,states one should not impute improper,12
NA,tives to any member of this House.,12
Mr HAWKE,I repeat that the unambigreasonable,12
NA,uous purport of the shadow Minister's media,12
NA,release is that there was a sinister relationthat,12
NA,ship between Mr Hayden's former principal,12
NA,private secretary--,12
Mr SINCLAIR ,I rise on a,12
NA,Madam Speaker. To be more specific on the It,12
NA,"earlier point of order, I would suggest that Zemskov",12
NA,the Prime Minister's use of the word 'sinisSoviet,12
NA,ter' to describe motives of any member of,12
NA,this House is entirely improper and I suggest,12
NA,that the remark be withdrawn.,12
Mr BEAZLEY ,I rise to speak to that point,12
NA,"of order, Madam Speaker. We have all",12
NA,in Question Time here over many years now.,12
NA,"In the cut and thrust of Question Time, story",12
NA,obviously both in questions that are asked of anything,12
NA,the Government and in answers that,12
NA,"given, there is a reasonable degree of lati-",12
NA,tude. There is no suggestion in anything,12
NA,the Prime Minister has said that he is,12
NA,some way impugning the propriety of the,12
NA,honourable member opposite. The suggestion,12
NA,that there is something particularly sinister,12
NA,about a relationship does not go to any beconclusion,12
NA,haviour of the honourable gentleman oppoa,12
NA,site. It is a perfectly reasonable statement,12
NA,the context of an answer to a parliamentary,12
NA,question.,12
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The Chair accepts,12
NA,the statement but again tells the Prime Minments,12
NA,ister to ensure that he does not in any way,12
NA,impugn the motives of any member of this,12
NA,House.,12
Mr HAWKE,"Madam Speaker, there was and",12
NA,not the slightest foundation given in,12
NA,statement by the shadow Minister for the,12
NA,serious attack that has been made on a senHouse,12
NA,ior Australian career diplomat. In making,12
NA,the allegation the shadow Minister refers,12
NA,reto a Canberra Times report on 5 February.,12
NA,member His press release says:,12
NA,It may also be a cause for particularly grave,12
NA,concern that according to the Canberra Times of 5,12
NA,"February, 1989, Zemskov developed a close relation-",12
NA,ship with Mr Hayden's former Principal Private Sec-,12
NA,retary who is now a Deputy Secretary of the,12
NA,of Foreign Affairs and Trade . . .,12
NA,That is the only support he has in making,12
NA,allegation. He suggests that the relation-,12
NA,ship between the Australian official and,12
NA,moZemskov is a cause for particularly grave,12
NA,"concern. I ask you, Madam Speaker, and all",12
NA,members of this House to note,12
NA,that the shadow Minister neglected to say,12
NA,the very same report in the Canberra,12
NA,Times from which he was quoting says:,12
NA,... there was never any suggestion of impropriety.,12
NA,"point of order, The report says:",12
NA,was natural enough that Mr Costello should know,12
NA,in view of his professional responsibilities,12
NA,in the Department for Australia's relations with the,12
NA,Union.,12
NA,That is from the report of the Canberra,12
NA,Times. But it becomes worse when we con-,12
NA,sider the fact that on the following day the,12
NA,same paper printed a piece headed 'Zem-,12
NA,"been skov: Clarification', which said:",12
NA,The Canberra Times reiterates that its original,12
NA,did not suggest Mr Costello's conduct was,12
NA,"but appropriate, professional and necessary",12
NA,are to the execution of his duties.,12
NA,that The honourable member having based his,12
NA,in allegations on the newspaper's report but,12
NA,"neglecting, obviously deliberately, even to",12
NA,mention these clear and unequivocal state-,12
NA,"ments by the Canberra Times, I believe the",12
NA,is unavoidable that there has been,12
NA,malicious and unfounded attack upon an,12
NA,in individual. It is an exercise in MCCarthyism,12
NA,which is to the immense discredit of the,12
NA,shadow Minister and the entire Opposition.,12
NA,The shadow Minister compounds his mis-,12
NA,take by going on to suggest that develop-,12
NA,in Australia's relations with the Soviet,12
NA,"Union, in particular the conclusion of a con-",12
NA,"sular agreement, can be traced to the alleg-",12
NA,edly sinister relationship between Zemskov,12
NA,the Australian official. That is preposter-,12
NA,"the ous. Moreover, the shadow Minister mayor",12
NA,"may not be interested, but I am sure the",12
NA,"will, to know that the Australian Se-",12
NA,curity Intelligence Organisation had no diffi-,12
NA,only culties from its perspective with the,12
NA,conclusion of that agreement and was thor-,13
NA,oughly involved in the interdepartmental,13
NA,consideration of it.,13
NA,Let me say in conclusion that the Govern-,13
NA,ment totally rejects the allegations which,13
NA,have been made. I say here on the floor of,13
NA,the House that we affirm without qualifica-,13
NA,tion our complete confidence in the loyalty,13
NA,and integrity of Mr Costello. Mr Costello,13
NA,emerges with his very substantial standing,13
NA,and reputation for competence and integrity,13
NA,"untarnished, and, if it is possible-and",13
NA,it-the shadow Minister emerges from this,13
NA,disgraceful episode even more an object of,13
NA,contempt than he was before.,13
NA,SOVIET DIPLOMAT,13
Mr SPENDER,My question is addressed,13
NA,to the Prime Minister. In view of the fact,13
NA,that the Prime Minister has now gone behind,13
NA,the screen to tell us what the Australian,13
NA,"Security Intelligence Organisation thinks, will",13
NA,"the Prime Minister tell us why, after ASIO",13
NA,had advised his Government and his Foreign,13
NA,Minister on the day before Mr Zemskov left,13
NA,Moscow that he had been identified by MI5,13
NA,as a Soviet agent and a member of the,13
NA,"special reserve, that same individual was al-",13
NA,lowed to come to this country and remain in,13
NA,this country for three years when it was,13
NA,known that he was a Soviet spy?,13
Mr HAWKE,I am certainly aware of,13
NA,the media reports and the reports to which,13
NA,the honourable gentleman refers. I will re-,13
NA,peat what I said at the outset of my previous,13
NA,"answer, that, in accordance with practice-",13
NA,not merely the practice of this Government,13
NA,but a longstanding practice of successive,13
NA,ernments-the Government will not com-,13
NA,ment in detail on reports relating to,13
NA,intelligence and security matters. I do not,13
NA,intend to breach that principle that was fol-,13
NA,lowed by the coalition Government when it,13
NA,was in office and by successive governments.,13
NA,I can assure honourable members that this,13
NA,Government obviously takes very seriously,13
NA,indeed its responsibilities in the area,13
NA,tional security and will continue to do so.,13
Mr SPENDER ,I seek leave to table a doc-,13
NA,ument marked 'Cabinet in Confidence' and,13
NA,", 'Secret', two pages, directed to Mr Hayden",13
NA,"from . Mr A. D. Campbell, Deputy Secretary",13
NA,"to the Department, dated II March 1986. It",13
NA,sets out in detail the matters to which I have,13
NA,referred. That will allow the Prime Minister,13
NA,to refresh his memory.,13
NA,Leave not granted.,13
NA,PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING,13
Mr GEAR,My question is addressed to,13
NA,the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the,13
NA,House what role reduced public sector bor-,13
NA,rowing is playing in combating Australia's,13
NA,balance of payments difficulties? Further-,13
NA,"more, what evidence is there of support for",13
NA,I doubt this approach?,13
Mr KEATING,The reduction in the,13
NA,public sector borrowing requirement from,13
NA,the 7 per cent of gross domestic product,13
NA,which existed when this Government came,13
NA,to office to this year's zero figure in prospect,13
NA,is a central part of the economic policy of,13
NA,the Government arrayed against Australia's,13
NA,"economic problems, particularly the current",13
NA,"account deficit-that is, to free up savings",13
NA,within Australia by a program of public sec-,13
NA,tor dis-saving to allow those funds to go,13
NA,"where Australia needs them most, and that",13
NA,is investment in the import-competing and,13
NA,exporting sectors. As I have said in the House,13
NA,"before, we are now presiding over the largest",13
NA,investment phase since records were first,13
NA,"kept, which was 1948.",13
NA,The other part of the question asks,13
NA,whether there is political support for the,13
NA,Government's policy approach. We have bi-,13
NA,partisan support because today we discov-,13
NA,ered that the shadow Treasurer has endorsed,13
NA,the Government's fiscal policy. He has,13
NA,promised that a Federal coalition govern-,13
NA,gov- ment would aim to have a sufficient Budget,13
NA,surplus after tax cuts to offset all Common-,13
NA,"wealth and State borrowings; that is, he is",13
NA,"arguing for, and promising, under a coalition",13
NA,"government, a zero public sector borrowing",13
NA,requirement. That is what we will have in,13
NA,prospect this financial year-a zero one for,13
NA,the first time in 35 years.,13
NA,Let me contrast that statement with the,13
NA,of na- high drama of a week ago. The Opposition,13
NA,was going to come into the House and give,13
NA,the Government a torrid time. There was a,13
NA,censure motion moved against the Prime,13
NA,Minister. The essence of the Opposition's,13
NA,argument was that this Government had not,13
NA,adjusted policy sufficiently to meet Austral-,13
NA,ia's balance of payments problem. On page,13
NA,24 of Hansard of 28 February the shadow,14
NA,Treasurer said in the debate:,14
NA,The Government has given up on fiscal policy-,14
NA,"so that is out of the way. It will not act on that,",14
NA,we will.,14
NA,I emphasise the words 'but we will'. The,14
NA,next day he asked a question of me. He,14
NA,referred to an address I gave to the Eco-,14
NA,nomic Planning Advisory Council in which I,14
NA,said:,14
NA,We will not hesitate to adjust policy,14
NA,He went on to say:,14
NA,"In view of that undertaking, why has the Treas-",14
NA,urer failed to adjust economic policy?,14
NA,On Tuesday he said that the Opposition,14
NA,would adjust policy; he then by inference,14
NA,asked me why we had not adjusted policy.,14
NA,After all of that he comes out and says that,14
NA,basically it is all bets off; the Opposition,14
NA,endorses the Government's fiscal policy. He,14
NA,endorses the Government's fiscal policy. In,14
NA,"other words, we find out a week later, after",14
NA,"all this hubbub, that the Opposition's fiscal",14
NA,policy objective will be exactly the same as,14
NA,that of the Government. All the high drama,14
NA,and contrived urgency have evaporated and,14
NA,we have the shadow Treasurer endorsing the,14
NA,Government's fiscal policy. He is laughing.,14
NA,Does he deny it? He goes on to say this--,14
NA,NA,14
NA,"a point of order. Regrettably, the Standing",14
NA,"Orders do not permit a response at this point,",14
NA,but the Treasurer has asked a question. I,14
NA,"will simply say that I am foreshadowing,",14
NA,"under the Standing Orders, that--",14
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! The honour-,14
NA,able member does not have a point of order.,14
NA,He will resume his seat. He does not have,14
NA,the call; he does not have a standing order.,14
NA,NA,14
NA,point of order. In circumstances in which a,14
NA,Minister is basing an answer on an edited,14
NA,"transcript, it is possible, at the end of Ques-",14
NA,"tion Time, to set him correct, is it not?",14
NA,Madam SPEAKER-I will put the,14
NA,honourable member on my list for personal,14
NA,explanations.,14
Mr KEATING,I will be interested to see,14
NA,the honourable member deny Mr Hadler's,14
NA,"story, if that is what he proposes to do. The",14
NA,"fact of the matter is that the Opposition, in",14
NA,"a matter of the most important policy, is",14
NA,advocating no alternative policy strategy to,14
NA,that of the Government. That is what the,14
NA,interview means. That is what the claim,14
NA,but means. The Opposition says it will tighten,14
NA,"fiscal policy, cut outlays, do all of these",14
NA,"things, but when pressed it endorses Govern-",14
NA,ment policy. HonQurable members opposite,14
NA,have such a great policy plank that they are,14
NA,actually endorsing the Government's basic,14
NA,economic strategy. They are hoping to pres-,14
NA,. . .,14
NA,ent themselves as an alternative at the next,14
NA,election campaign but their shadow Treas-,14
NA,urer has committed them to the Govern-,14
NA,"ment's economic policy. Apparently, by",14
NA,implication from the Leader of the National,14
NA,"Party of Australia, we will have the device",14
NA,often employed by the coalition of denying,14
NA,its words and denying journalists' stories. We,14
NA,will see where it stands.,14
NA,I said last week and I will say it again: it,14
NA,is time that the shadow Treasurer appeared,14
NA,at a press conference to be questioned on,14
NA,these issues. It is not simply for the Prime,14
NA,"Minister, my colleagues and me to appear-",14
NA,good news or bad-at press conferences. The,14
NA,Opposition should appear at press confer-,14
NA,"ences. Despite all the huffing and puffing, we",14
NA,find now that the shadow Treasurer in the,14
NA,alternative government endorses as his policy,14
NA,the policies of the existing government.,14
NA,HEALTH FUNDS,14
Mr SHACK,My question to the Minister,14
NA,for Community Services and Health is based,14
NA,on a page 1 story appearing in today's Mel-,14
NA,bourne Herald headed 'Health Funds Facing,14
NA,Giant Losses'. I quote briefly a couple of,14
NA,paragraphs. The article states:,14
NA,Minister for Health Dr Blewett has called an emer-,14
NA,gency meeting with HBA Health Insurance to discuss,14
NA,the company's ability to meet its financial,14
NA,commitments.,14
NA,"Further on, it states:",14
NA,'Tomorrow we'll be asking HBA for a detailed game,14
NA,plan on how they're going to improve their situation',14
NA,a spokesman for Dr Blewett said today. 'The Minis-,14
NA,ter has been watching HBA and several other com-,14
NA,panies closely because they've dropped below the,14
NA,two months of reserves required by law'.,14
NA,Does the Minister stand by the comments,14
NA,attributed to his spokesman? Why did the,14
NA,Minister not answer the question I put to,14
NA,"him last Thursday when I asked, in part,",14
NA,whether he would advise the House whether,14
NA,or not all health funds are currently meeting,14
NA,"the statutory reserve requirement? Finally,",15
NA,"in the light of the story, I now ask the",15
NA,Minister again: how many funds are operat-,15
NA,ing below the two-month reserve provision;,15
NA,how many are continuing to operate under,15
NA,the exemptions from this provision; and for,15
NA,how long have they been doing so?,15
Dr BLEWETT,"I would have hoped that,",15
NA,in the interests of the private health funds,15
NA,"themselves, this issue would not have been",15
NA,canvassed in the rather irresponsible way it,15
NA,has been both in the press and in this House.,15
NA,"First of all, let me explain to the honourable",15
NA,member for Tangney the operation of the,15
NA,two-month rule which he has referred to.,15
NA,My Department is responsible under the Na-,15
NA,tional Health Act to monitor the financial,15
NA,operation of these funds. The Act requires,15
NA,that health funds maintain reserves equal to,15
NA,two months of break-even contribution in-,15
NA,"come., Where a fund cannot comply with",15
NA,"this requirement at any time, there is provi-",15
NA,"sion for an exemption to be granted, and",15
NA,such an exemption is granted under con-,15
NA,trolled conditions and where demonstrable,15
NA,corrective action is being taken. Let me point,15
NA,out that the two-month period is simply a,15
NA,guideline and is used as a guideline to mon-,15
NA,itor funds where there may be some prob-,15
NA,"lem. Indeed, large funds can vary aro!lnd",15
NA,that guideline without any serious financial,15
NA,"difficulties, as they do not face the same",15
NA,degree of concern about sudden heavy draw-,15
NA,ing as do the small funds.,15
NA,"There has been, as I say, some irrespons-­",15
NA,"ble speculation about one particular fund,",15
NA,and we have been having discussions with,15
NA,"that fund. However, I am advised that that",15
NA,fund certainly has sufficient reserves to meet,15
NA,any claims on it by contributors. So contrib-,15
NA,utors need not be alarmed by some of the,15
NA,sensationalist reporting that has taken place.,15
NA,"As I say, this issue has been sensationalised",15
NA,"in a, way that is not in the interests of the",15
NA,private health funds themselves. Let me say,15
NA,"that there is no emergency meeting, as was",15
NA,"claimed today,in the Melbourne Herald. It",15
NA,is part of ongoing discussions that we have,15
NA,been having with this fund. All I say at this,15
NA,stage is what I said the other day in this,15
NA,House: I give the honourable member for,15
NA,Tangney the assurance that this Government,15
NA,will ensure that the contributors of any fund,15
NA,will not be put at risk.,15
NA,SOCIAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT,15
Mr SNOWDON,Is the Minister for So-,15
NA,cial Security aware of the Australian Insti-,15
NA,tute of Family Studies report entitled,15
NA,Families and Tax in 1989? Can the Minister,15
NA,inform the House of the relevance of the,15
NA,report to social policy development?,15
Mr HOWE,The report is a theoretical,15
NA,study of the effects of the tax transfer sys-,15
NA,"tem; that is, the interaction of tax on the",15
NA,social security system. I think it is important,15
NA,to make the point that the analysis is no,15
NA,more than that. The report makes it clear,15
NA,that it is referring to hypothetical couples,15
NA,earning around average weekly earnings,15
NA,"(AWE). It is important, when one is discuss-",15
NA,"ing income distribution and income transfers,",15
NA,to take account of social wage measures that,15
NA,are not taken into account in the Institute's,15
NA,"document, for example, the impact of Med-",15
NA,"icare. If a family has children, clearly it",15
NA,needs health insurance. Medicare is worth,15
NA,about $21 a week for a family earning around,15
NA,"AWE. In relation to superannuation, this",15
NA,"Government, with the Australian Council of",15
NA,"Trade Unions, has made superannuation",15
NA,widely available to ordinary families. Under,15
NA,the 3 per cent arrangements that is worth,15
NA,$14.40 a week for an AWE family. In the,15
NA,"area of education, we do not need to refer",15
NA,"only to the increase in the retention rates,",15
NA,"from 35 to 65 per cent, under this Govern-",15
NA,ment-nea-ly 30 per cent more are staying,15
NA,"to year 12-but more precisely, an AWE",15
NA,family with one year 11 student and two,15
NA,younger children will receive about $32 a,15
NA,week from Austudy.,15
NA,"So, taking just those three social wage",15
NA,measures together and comparing them with,15
NA,the Institute of Family Studies alleged tax,15
NA,"loss, we are talking about a gain of $67 or",15
NA,"its equivalent, compared with the alleged",15
NA,AIFS tax loss of $27 to $34 a week. I think,15
NA,it is important to say that social policy is not,15
NA,"built, and will never be constructed, on hy-",15
NA,pothetical examples. One of the problems,15
NA,with the Opposition's preoccupation with,15
NA,"what it calls the typical family-that is, a",15
NA,single income couple with two children-is,15
NA,that that so-called typical family represents,15
NA,something like 7 per cent of all income units.,15
NA,"In other words, rather than being typical",15
NA,"over the whole distribution, it is in fact quite",15
NA,atypical. The Institute of Family Studies sup-,15
NA,ports and indeed indicates the quite signifi-,16
NA,cant gains that have been made with respect,16
NA,"to low income families. For example, it talks",16
NA,about a couple with two children aged less,16
NA,"than 13 years on half AWE, which is in fact",16
NA,"$18 a week, being better off in tax terms",16
NA,than it would have been under the 1976-77,16
NA,conditions.,16
NA,When we see the announcement of policy,16
NA,by an important group such as the Institute,16
NA,of Family Studies-it is an important study-,16
NA,it is not long before the Opposition jumps,16
NA,"on to the bandwagon. Mr Howard, who has",16
NA,apparently been quite sceptical about the,16
NA,"Institute, said he thought its work was valu-",16
NA,able and he was not sceptical any more. That,16
NA,reminded me that there was some scepticism,16
NA,on the part of the Government at the time,16
NA,"of the last election, when a policy was re-",16
NA,leased by the Opposition which purported to,16
NA,deliver massive gains to middle income fam-,16
NA,ilies. I think it would not be untrue to say,16
NA,that those gains were described as massive.,16
NA,"But as the debate unfolded, as the Govern-",16
NA,ment gave consideration to the detail of that,16
NA,policy and took it away from being a hypo-,16
NA,"thetical policy, into a policy which would",16
NA,have to be costed and presented to the Aus-,16
NA,"tralian people as real, there was found to be",16
NA,some double counting of the order of $1 t,16
NA,billion. Before the Opposition jumps on to,16
NA,the bandwagon with this document and,16
NA,"adopts it as policy and says, 'That is what",16
NA,we are going to throw up at the next elec-,16
NA,tion--,16
Mr TUCKEY ,"Madam Speaker, I raise a",16
NA,point of order. I refer you to your own point,16
NA,of order which you raised on 9 September,16
NA,"1981, when you said:",16
NA,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your",16
NA,"attention to the Hansard of 27 August. You ruled,",16
NA,'The Minister will answer the question and not en-,16
NA,"gage in irrelevancies, such as contrasting the Govern-",16
NA,ment and the Labor Party'.,16
NA,If this Minister were as generous with his,16
NA,"money as he is with his words, no-one would",16
NA,be living in poverty. He has been going for,16
NA,five minutes and he should cease.,16
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! The honour-,16
NA,able member has raised his point of order. I,16
NA,call the Minister for Social Security in,16
NA,conclusion.,16
Mr HOWE,Let me come very much to,16
NA,the point. No doubt the proposal of the,16
NA,Institute of Family Studies is very attractive,16
NA,"to the Opposition, a concept so attractive",16
NA,that no longer is the Leader of the Opposi-,16
NA,tion sceptical. In fact the AIFS was out in,16
NA,"its costing by more than $1 billion, so that",16
NA,what was presented as a $5.6 billion proposal,16
NA,was in fact a $6.6 -illion proposal.,16
NA,I conclude by saying that it may occur to,16
NA,the Opposition-there was some reference to,16
NA,this in the Australian Financial Review this,16
NA,morning-that perhaps we can go to the,16
NA,"election without all the agony of costing,",16
NA,without the calculations of the replacement,16
NA,for the honourable member for Mackellar;,16
NA,that we could go on attitudes. The Govern-,16
NA,ment does not operate on the basis of atti-,16
NA,tudes. We operate on the basis of producing,16
NA,policies which are fair for families. I refer to,16
NA,"the whole cross-section of families. Secondly,",16
NA,we operate on the basis of policies which,16
NA,"give greater opportunities, particularly to low",16
NA,income families and--,16
NA,"Mr Rocher-I take a point of order,",16
NA,Madam Speaker. The terms of your ruling,16
NA,were that the Minister should conclude. It is,16
NA,taking him an inordinately long time to do,16
NA,so. I think you will agree that it is unreason-,16
NA,able and that he should be asked to sit down.,16
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The Minister has,16
NA,been asked to conclude his remarks. I now,16
NA,draw his attention to the request from the,16
NA,Chair.,16
Mr HOWE,"I conclude by saying that,",16
NA,"secondly, our policies are about giving to low",16
NA,income families-who were excluded by the,16
NA,failed policies of the Opposition-a leg-up,16
NA,and an opportunity to get back into the,16
NA,"mainstream. Finally, unlike the Opposition's",16
NA,"family reforms of 1976-which, despite what",16
NA,"Senator Chaney says, proved to be unsus-",16
NA,tainable-the reforms that we bring about,16
NA,for families will prove to be sustainable and,16
NA,"responsible fiscally, and, frankly, we cost",16
NA,them accurately.,16
NA,ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT,16
NA,ISLANDER COMMISSION,16
Mr MILES,I direct my question to the,16
NA,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and refer him,16
NA,to his statement to the House of 21 Decem-,16
NA,ber 1988 in relation to his meeting with State,16
NA,and Territory Aboriginal affairs Ministers the,16
NA,previous month that:,16
NA,". for the first time at any of these meetings,",17
NA,we had unanimous decisions between the Common-,17
NA,wealth and the States on every issue raised there.,17
NA,How does the Minister reconcile his state-,17
NA,ment to the Parliament with the fact that,17
NA,the minutes of the meeting of the Australian,17
NA,Aboriginal Affairs Council to which he re-,17
NA,ferred clearly showed that the Queensland,17
NA,"Minister for Community Services, Mr Bob",17
NA,"Katter, made clear the Queensland Govern-",17
NA,ment's implacable opposition to the Aborig-,17
NA,inal and Torres Strait Islander Commission,17
NA,"Bill? Furthermore, is it not a fact that a",17
NA,proposal to hold a summit on the Aboriginal,17
NA,and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill,17
NA,was opposed by the majority of the Council,17
NA,members from the States and Northern Ter-,17
NA,"ritory? In light of these facts, how does the",17
NA,Minister explain misleading the House on 21,17
NA,December 1988?,17
Mr HAND,"Firstly, the minutes referred",17
NA,"to, and which have been agreed to by all",17
NA,State Ministers present at the most recent,17
NA,"meeting, are draft minutes. Secondly, there",17
NA,was a decision taken in terms of the Aborig-,17
NA,inal and Torres Strait Islander Commission,17
NA,(ATSIC) which was a unanimous decision.,17
NA,NA,17
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The Deputy Leader,17
NA,of the Opposition has already been asked,17
NA,twice to cease interjecting.,17
Mr HAND,That decision on ATSIC was,17
NA,that I would agree to communicate with all,17
NA,Ministers of the various States to make ar-,17
NA,rangements for a briefing on ATSIC by de-,17
NA,partmental officers and I would agree to,17
NA,meet with the Ministers prior to the intro-,17
NA,duction of the legislation. Interestingly,17
NA,"enough, from memory, only one Minister",17
NA,responded .to that- Mr Katter certainly did-,17
NA,and he sought a day long meeting with me,17
NA,to discuss his concerns about ATSIC. Fol-,17
NA,"lowing that, a further meeting was held here",17
NA,in Canberra to discuss the findings of the,17
NA,Muirhead Royal Commission into Aboriginal,17
NA,"Deaths in Custody, at which a number of",17
NA,the States requested that a meeting be held,17
NA,of State Ministers and me prior to the intro-,17
NA,duction of the legislation into the Senate.,17
NA,That was agreed to by me and arrangements,17
NA,for that meeting are currently being made.,17
NA,The difficulty we are having is in getting all,17
NA,the Ministers available on the one day. But,17
NA,the meeting certainly will be held. I cannot,17
NA,"recall the second part of the question, but I",17
NA,will take it on notice and provide a response.,17
NA,Mr Miles-The second part of the ques-,17
NA,tion related to the tied vote.,17
Mr HAND,There was a tied vote.,17
NA,Therefore the vote lapsed. There was a,17
NA,unanimous decision that I would write to,17
NA,them and I would communicate with them.,17
NA,Therefore it was unanimous.,17
NA,WHEAT MARKETING,17
NA,ARRANGEMENTS,17
Mr COURTICE,My question is directed,17
NA,to the Minister for Primary Industries and,17
NA,Energy. Can the Minister advise the House,17
NA,"of the reasons ,for the Government's pro-",17
NA,posed changes to wheat marketing arrange-,17
NA,ments and whether the Government will,17
NA,change its proposals in response to the ar-,17
NA,guments being raised by the Opposition?,17
Mr KERIN,I thank the honourable,17
NA,"member, particularly for asking for the rea-",17
NA,sons for the Government's policy. It may be,17
NA,instructive to the Opposition. Let us just go,17
NA,through them. The first reason is to allow,17
NA,the Australian Wheat Board to have enough,17
NA,"power to catalyse changes in storage, trans-",17
NA,"port and handling, to give farmers cost sav-",17
NA,ings off-farm on an ongoing basis. The second,17
NA,reason is to allow the Australian Wheat,17
NA,Board to be more effectively involved com-,17
NA,"mercially in domestic trading, thus allowing",17
NA,it to compete with private firms and traders,17
NA,under the permit system. Since the Govern-,17
NA,ment has announced this policy a lot of good,17
NA,things have been happening and there is a,17
NA,lot of change under way in the Australian,17
NA,"grain sector. For example, the Queensland",17
NA,Government has come out with a Green,17
NA,Paper that virtually duplicates what the,17
NA,"Commonwealth is trying to do, but of course",17
NA,it wants to lock up Queensland as a State as,17
NA,far as wheat is concerned.,17
NA,The New South Wales Government has,17
NA,been doing the right thing in respect of its,17
NA,Grain Handling Authority. The Victorian,17
NA,Government has been able to negotiate a,17
NA,lower freight rate for the Australian Wheat,17
NA,Board this year. The cotton industry in,17
NA,Queensland is moving to a private approach,17
NA,"to the marketing of cotton, away from boards.",17
NA,The Queensland Barley Board is moving to,17
NA,a permit system. There is a court case under,18
NA,way on section 92 with respect to State grain,18
NA,"boards. A lot is happening, but the Opposi-",18
NA,tion cannot see that. It fought the status quo,18
NA,last time at the behest of the Australian,18
NA,Wheatgrowers Federation; now it wants to,18
NA,"fight the status quo this time, five years on.",18
NA,All that we are proposing is a little bit of,18
NA,what the Wool Corporation has been doing,18
NA,very successfully since 1974.,18
NA,Let us look at some of the other reasons.,18
NA,We also want to place the Australian Wheat,18
NA,Board in a position to trade in other grains,18
NA,so that it can assist some of the smaller,18
NA,industries and get away from the nonsense,18
NA,of many of the small State grain marketing,18
NA,boards when it is sensible to do so. The fact,18
NA,is that the growers of grain legumes can,18
NA,"assemble small cargoes but not large cargoes,",18
NA,and we are producing more grain legumes.,18
NA,Another reason is to prepare the Australian,18
NA,Wheat Board to be more pro-active in inter-,18
NA,national grain marketing. The fact is that,18
NA,because of restrictions on the Wheat Board,18
NA,we have missed many opportunities in inter-,18
NA,national markets over the years. Another,18
NA,reason is that we want to prepare the grains,18
NA,industry for the mental leap from the wheat-,18
NA,sheep belt to a growing livestock-grain sec-,18
NA,"tor, and that is happening. Another reason",18
NA,is that we want to allow the development of,18
NA,"additional export industries, such as starch",18
NA,"export and food manufacturing, thereby ex-",18
NA,panding wheat production in this country.,18
NA,We also want to institute general effi-,18
NA,ciency gains for the cropping sector by not,18
NA,overencouraging one grain at the expense of,18
NA,"others. There are other reasons, and of course",18
NA,all this is opposed by many honourable mem-,18
NA,bers opposite-mainly because the Grains,18
NA,Council of Australia is opposed and that,18
NA,"organisation is split, Liberal versus National.",18
NA,"To do these things, because of the reasons I",18
NA,"have just set out to the House, we have",18
NA,decided to retain the Board's export monop-,18
NA,"oly on milling and industrial wheat, to re-",18
NA,move the sunset clause so that any future,18
NA,John Elliott Liberal government-Roger,18
NA,Shipton should resign in about 2016-or any,18
NA,future government will need an Act of Par-,18
NA,liament to remove that monopoly; to make,18
NA,"the Board more commercial, particularly al-",18
NA,lowing it to trade in cash on the domestic,18
NA,"market, including in competition with pri-",18
NA,vate traders; and to align the underwriting,18
NA,arrangement more closely with market sig-,18
NA,nals while maintaining high first advances to,18
NA,growers.,18
NA,"As a result of these changes growers will,",18
NA,"for the first time, have an effective choice in",18
NA,who they sell their wheat to. They can sell,18
NA,"to the Board's pools, they can sell to the",18
NA,Board's cash trading arm or they can sell to,18
NA,private traders. At present the Board has,18
NA,been effectively restricted from doing that.,18
NA,"We hear a lot about competition, deregula-",18
NA,tion and choice from honourable members,18
NA,"on the other side, but in this new competitive",18
NA,environment all market participants-the,18
NA,"Board, the transport and handling authorities",18
NA,and the private traders-will need to max-,18
NA,imise their efficiency. They will need to keep,18
NA,charges to growers as low as possible or they,18
NA,will simply not get any grain.,18
NA,That is why these changes will benefit,18
NA,growers. Their costs will be lower. This sav-,18
NA,ing will more than outweigh the small effect,18
NA,on domestic prices as domestic prices more,18
NA,accurately reflect market developments and,18
NA,market realities. But none of this impresses,18
NA,National Party members. They have no pol-,18
NA,icy formation machinery; they just wander,18
NA,"around the landscape, agreeing to whatever",18
NA,case is put to them by the farmers. Senator,18
NA,MCGauran has lied not only about the Gov-,18
NA,ernment's intentions but also about the po-,18
NA,sition of those in the Liberal Party who,18
NA,recognise--,18
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The Minister will,18
NA,withdraw that comment.,18
Mr KERIN,I withdraw. Senator Mc-,18
NA,Gauran has misrepresented the Govern-,18
NA,ment's intentions and also the position of the,18
NA,"Liberal Party, which recognises the value of",18
NA,"what we are doing. Of course, he has re-",18
NA,ceived no reprimand from his leader.,18
NA,The Leader of the Opposition has grandly,18
NA,announced that the coalition will vote the,18
NA,same way on the issue. But which way will,18
NA,that be? Will the National Party once again,18
NA,kick the Liberal Party off its favoured turf,18
NA,of protecting the agricultural status quo?,18
NA,"Every time that the Liberals-who, I might",18
NA,"add, have as many members in this Parlia-",18
NA,ment representing rural seats as the National,18
NA,"Party, although not as many as the Labor",18
NA,"Party-try to influence rural policy, they",18
NA,meet the most vehement reaction from the,19
NA,National Party. It goes back decades. Mc-,19
NA,Ewen blackballed MCMahon because he ac-,19
NA,tually had the gall to face up to what was,19
NA,wrong with National Party policies. It has,19
NA,taken the Liberals 20 years even to begin to,19
NA,contemplate shrugging off the legacy of that,19
NA,piece of blackmail at that time. Once again,19
NA,we are facing the political blackmail of the,19
NA,National Party. The National Party is cor-,19
NA,rupt and undemocratic in Queensland; it,19
NA,cannot help itself in northern New South,19
NA,Wales; it is brawling in Victoria and Western,19
NA,"Australia; but there is hope for it, as it",19
NA,received 1.6 per cent of the vote in the,19
NA,Australian Capital Territory election and Joh,19
NA,is to lead Grey Power. That is the record of,19
NA,the Nationals. Let me spell it out clearly to,19
NA,the Opposition: the Government's proposals,19
NA,will benefit wheat growers. The Opposition,19
NA,will have to make up its mind during the,19
NA,first half of this year. We will not give it an,19
NA,"extra 12 months to sort out its own splits,",19
NA,misrepresentations and nonsense.,19

Mr SPENDER,Yes.,19
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The honourable,19
NA,member may proceed.,19
Mr SPENDER,This afternoon the Prime,19
NA,"Minister ( Mr Hawke), in answer to a pre-",19
NA,"pared question, made an attack on me. I",19
NA,"could not hear everything that he said but,",19
NA,"amongst other things, he said that I had",19
NA,engaged in a serious attack-I believe those,19
NA,were his words-on Mr Costello; that I had,19
NA,been grossly unfair; that I had imputed a,19
NA,"sinister relationship. Quite simply, that is",19
NA,nonsense. I have not questioned the personal,19
NA,"propriety, motives or general professionalism",19
NA,"of that gentleman. I have questioned, and I",19
NA,"question most profoundly, any kind of non-",19
NA,official relationship between any senior offi-,19
NA,cial in the Department of Foreign Affairs,19
NA,"and Trade or, indeed, any other department,",19
NA,"and a known KGB spy who, due to the",19

NA,lowed to come here and stay here for three,19
NA,years--,19
Mr BEAZLEY ,I raise a point of order. The,19
NA,honourable member has gone outside the,19
NA,framework of personal explanations. He is,19
NA,debating the matter.,19

NA,"Australian by Mr Robert Hadler, a gentle-",19
NA,"man for whom I have great respect and who,",19
NA,"because of the interview, kindly provided me",19
NA,with a copy of his reporter's transcript. In,19
NA,"the nature of many reporters' transcripts, the",19
NA,"transcript, which I have in my office, is not",19
NA,held out to be full and detailed. Mr Hadler's,19
NA,reporter's transcript reads:,19
NA,Q. . . . would you still aim to have a suffi-,19
NA,cient surplus to produce . . . a zero net PSBR?,19
NA,"A. That would be our aim, as it is the Govern-",19
NA,ment's aim. But in fact the Government on the very,19
NA,figures I've given you . . . will not be able to,20
NA,"achieve their aim, they won't be able to do it.",20
NA,There the answer in the reporter's edited,20
NA,transcript ends. The full transcript goes on:,20
NA,"I mean, just to take into account the figures I've",20
NA,"given you, puts them in position where their aim,",20

NA,tempted to misrepresent the Deputy Leader,20
NA,"of the Opposition, the honourable member",20
NA,NA,20
NA,portant matter. Let me refer to the quote he,20
NA,refers to. The question is:,20
NA,. . . would you still aim to have a sufficient,20
NA,"surplus to produce a net, a zero net PSBR?",20
NA,Answer:,20
NA,That would be our aim.,20
NA,"That is, it would be the Opposition's aim to",20
NA,have a zero net public sector borrowing re-,20
NA,quirement. He goes on to say--,20
Mr TUCKEY ,"On a point of order, Madam",20
NA,Speaker. The Treasurer is now arguing.,20
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! The honour-,20
NA,able member will resume his seat. The Chair,20
NA,is hearing a personal explanation from the,20
NA,Treasurer.,20
Mr TUCKEY ,That is right and I am on a,20
NA,point of order.,20
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Go ahead.,20
Mr TUCKEY ,My point of order is that the,20
NA,Treasurer is now commencing to debate his,20
NA,"personal explanation, and he should be told",20
NA,to stop.,20
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The Chair has given,20
NA,a certain latitude to both sides of the House,20
NA,"on this matter. It is sometimes very difficult,",20
NA,"as I have pointed out before, when honour-",20
NA,able members are quoting from a newspaper,20
NA,"or when they are rebutting a point, to be as",20
NA,succinct as the Chair would like.,20
Mr TUCKEY ,"On a further point of order,",20
NA,Madam Speaker. Just before you took the,20
NA,point of order from the Leader of the House,20
NA,and before our spokesman on foreign affairs,20
NA,"immediately ceased his particular remarks,",20
NA,the remarks that the Treasurer was making,20
NA,as I got to my feet had nothing to do with,20
NA,the press release. He then started to argue,20
NA,"the case, and it is a pretty poor one.",20
NA,Madam SPEAKER-The honourable,20
NA,member will resume his seat. The honour-,20
NA,able member for North Sydney had indicated,20
NA,to the Chair that he had completed his per-,20
NA,sonal explanation.,20
Mr KEATING,The transcript goes on to,20
NA,"."" say:",20
NA,That would be our aim .,20
Mr TUCKEY ,Where have you been,20
NA,misrepresented?,20
Mr KEATING,The honourable member,20
NA,is suggesting that I have misrepresented the,20
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He is sug-,20
NA,gesting it. The transcript states:,20
NA,. . . as it is the Government's aim. But in fact,20
NA,the Government on the very figures I've given,20
NA,you . . . will not be able to achieve their,20
NA,aim . . .,20
NA,Whether there is any argument about,20
NA,whether the Government achieves it is im-,20
NA,"material. He said, 'It is the Opposition's aim",20
NA,"to have a zero net PSBR', which is existing",20
NA,Government policy.,20
NA,NAMIBIA,20
NA,Ministerial Statement,20
Mr HAWKE ,Wills-Prime Minister)-,20
NA,by leave-I report to the House on recent,20
NA,events in Namibia and Australia's role in,20
NA,assisting the implementation of United Na-,20
NA,tions Security Council Resolution 435 of,20
NA,"1978, providing for the withdrawal of South",20
NA,African military forces from Namibia and,20
NA,the holding of elections under United Na-,20
NA,tions (UN) supervision and control. As an-,20
NA,nounced by the Minister for Defence ( Mr,20
NA,Beazley) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs,20
NA,and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on,21
NA,"2 March 1989, a contingent of 300 Austra-",21
NA,lian engineers will leave shortly for Namibia.,21
NA,They will form part of a United Nations,21
NA,peacekeeping force in Namibia that will help,21
NA,bring independence to Namibia after more,21
NA,than 100 years of rule by foreign powers.,21
NA,The settlement of the long and complex,21
NA,issue of Namibian independence is an impor-,21
NA,tant international event. It is an event in,21
NA,"which Australia has played, and will con-",21
NA,"tinue to play, a substantial part. During my",21
NA,"recent visit to India, I noted that there had",21
NA,been much talk during the 1970s and early,21
NA,1980s about an arc of instability stretching,21
NA,"from southern Africa, through the Persian",21
NA,"Gulf, through Afghanistan and South Asia",21
NA,"and on to Indo-China. We see now, if not",21
NA,"an arc of peace, then at least an arc of",21
NA,"peace-making. It is a process, facilitated by",21
NA,an improvement in superpower relations and,21
NA,aided by the constructive role of the United,21
NA,"Nations, that is finally bringing the treasured",21
NA,goal of independence within sight of the,21
NA,people of Namibia.,21
NA,My Government recognises that the prob-,21
NA,lems in southern Africa constitute one of the,21
NA,major challenges facing the international,21
NA,"community. We have sought, through the",21
NA,"United Nations, the Commonwealth and our",21
NA,own diplomatic links with countries in the,21
NA,"region, to find peaceful solutions to the",21
NA,plex set of problems that trouble that region.,21
NA,"In recent times, there has been little cause",21
NA,for optimism in southern Africa. The offen-,21
NA,sive doctrine of apartheid remains en-,21
NA,"trenched in South Africa's social, political",21
NA,and economic life. Civil wars with drastic,21
NA,human consequences continue in Mozam-,21
NA,bique and Angola. The front line states of,21
NA,southern Africa-including fellow Common-,21
NA,"wealth members such as Botswana, Tanza-",21
NA,"nia, Zambia and Zimbabwe-continue to be",21
NA,vulnerable to economic and military desta-,21
NA,"bilisation. The question of Namibia, in many",21
NA,"ways, encapsulated a number of these",21
NA,problems.,21
NA,The fact that Namibia is now on the way,21
NA,to independence demonstrates that concerted,21
NA,"international action, the determination of the",21
NA,"region, and the goodwill of individual players",21
NA,can combine to bring solutions to longstand-,21
NA,ing problems in the region. For a southern,21
NA,"Africa torn by attrition, deprivation and",21
NA,"tragedy, recent moves on Namibia offer a",21
NA,glimmer of hope. The problem of Namibia,21
NA,has been with the international community,21
NA,for close on 70 years. South Africa was ap-,21
NA,pointed mandatory over the former German,21
NA,colony of South West Africa by the Treaty,21
NA,"of Versailles in 1919, in circumstances simi-",21
NA,lar to Australia's own mandate over Papua,21
NA,New Guinea. This mandate was confirmed,21
NA,by the League of Nations. After the Second,21
NA,"World War, the League of Nations was",21
NA,"superseded by the United Nations, and the",21
NA,mandate system by the trusteeship system.,21
NA,"Alone of the former mandatory powers,",21
NA,South Africa refused to submit a trusteeship,21
NA,"agreement for South West Africa, or Nami-",21
NA,"bia, as it is now known. In 1966, the UN",21
NA,General Assembly resolved that South Afri-,21
NA,"ca's role in Namibia should be terminated,",21
NA,and that the responsibility for the territory,21
NA,should be assumed by a UN-appointed,21
NA,Council for Namibia. Despite these deci-,21
NA,"sions, South Africa continued to govern Na-",21
NA,mibia against the wishes of the United,21
NA,"Nations, and claimed sovereignty over it in",21
NA,the face of widespread international,21
NA,condemnation.,21
NA,South African rule has been opposed from,21
NA,within Namibia since 1957 by the South West,21
NA,"Africa People's Organisation, SWAPO.",21
NA,SWAPO commenced an armed struggle in,21
NA,"com- 1966, and was supported in this by Nami-",21
NA,"bia's neighboijr to the north, Angola, when",21
NA,it achieved independence in 1975. South Af-,21
NA,rica responded by supporting an insurgency,21
NA,"against the Government of Angola, and by",21
NA,direct attacks against Angolan Government,21
NA,forces inside Angola. Angola sought Cuban,21
NA,"involvement and as many as 50,000 Cuban",21
NA,troops have been deployed there at· anyone,21
NA,"time. This involvement, with substantial So-",21
NA,"viet backing, became a significant source of",21
NA,East-West tension.,21
NA,It has taken years to begin to untangle this,21
NA,mess. In 1978 the UN agreed on a plan for,21
NA,a settlement contained in UN Security,21
NA,"Council Resolution 435, but intransigence on",21
NA,all sides prevented that plan from being im-,21
NA,"plemented. Then last year, in the context of",21
NA,"reduced East-West tensions, the log-jam",21
NA,started to break up. South Africa agreed to,21
NA,withdraw its forces and to allow Namibia its,21
NA,"independence, while Angola agreed to the",21
NA,withdrawal of Cuban forces and the removal,21
NA,of African National Congress camps from its,22
NA,territory. The signing of the Brazzaville,22
NA,tocol on 22 December last year by South,22
NA,"Africa, Cuba and Angola has at last formal-",22
NA,ised the acceptance by South Africa of the,22
NA,1978 UN settlement plan.,22
NA,Last month the UN Security Council,22
NA,agreed that the transition to independence,22
NA,for Namibia would begin on 1 April 1989.,22
NA,Over the 12 months from that date the UN,22
NA,"will monitor the withdrawal of foreign forces,",22
NA,oversee the drafting and adoption of a Con-,22
NA,"stitution, and supervise the installation of a",22
NA,new government after general elections. A,22
NA,vital element in this plan is the United,22
NA,Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UN-,22
NA,TAG). It will monitor the ceasefire and troop,22
NA,"withdrawals, supervise elections, and support",22
NA,the maintenance of law and order in Nami-,22
NA,bia until the new government of independent,22
NA,Namibia is ready to take over. The scale of,22
NA,these tasks is reflected in the size of the,22
NA,"force. UNTAG will have civilian, police and",22
NA,"military elements. The military element, will",22
NA,"consist initially of 4,650 personnel, including",22
NA,"three infantry battalions, with scope for ex-",22
NA,"pansion to 7,500 should the circumstances",22
NA,demand.,22
NA,Australia is providing the engineering,22
NA,component of UNTAG. Our contingent of,22
NA,23 officers and 277 other ranks will provide,22
NA,engineering and construction support to the,22
NA,UN effort. Such support will be sorely,22
NA,"needed. Namibia is a large, arid, sparsely",22
NA,populated and underdeveloped country which,22
NA,has been a war zone for many years. Our,22
NA,"engineers will build roads, bridges, airstrips",22
NA,and camps for UNT AG. They will have the,22
NA,very serious task of clearing mines which,22
NA,have been laid by the various contending,22
NA,forces along the border between Angola and,22
NA,"Namibia. This is, of course, not the first time",22
NA,Australian personnel have been involved with,22
NA,a peacekeeping force in Africa; we partici-,22
NA,pated in the Commonwealth force that mon-,22
NA,itored Zimbabwe's transition to independence,22
NA,"in 1980. In that process, as in others before",22
NA,"and since, Australian defence forces played",22
NA,a constructive role in what can be a difficult,22
NA,and sometimes dangerous process. Members,22
NA,of the Australian contingent will serve in,22
NA,"Namibia for tours of six months, after which",22
NA,they will be replaced by a fresh contingent,22
NA,from Australia. The UN plans to complete,22
NA,Namibia's transition to independence within,22
NA,"Pro- a year, but delays in this complex process",22
NA,"are possible, and we may be called upon to",22
NA,stay longer than a year. The bulk of the,22
NA,Australian contingent will be based at,22
NA,"Grootfontein in the north of Namibia, near",22
NA,the border with Angola. Elements of the,22
NA,contingent could be required to deploy into,22
NA,neighbouring countries to support UNT AG,22
NA,operations there.,22
NA,This is a very large and important com-,22
NA,"mitment for Australia, comprising almost half",22
NA,of the Army's construction engineering ca-,22
NA,"pability. Careful planning, including the use",22
NA,"of reservists, has been required to ensure that",22
NA,high priority engineering tasks closer to home,22
NA,can still be performed. I am pleased to say,22
NA,that it has been possible to minimise the,22
NA,impact of the deployment on support to the,22
NA,"operational deployment force, exercise Kan-",22
NA,"garoo 89, and the defence cooperation pro-",22
NA,"gram in the South Pacific, where our",22
NA,"engineers build wharves, airstrips and other",22
NA,essential infrastructure.,22
NA,It has to be understood that the political,22
NA,and military situation in the border region,22
NA,where the bulk of our men will be deployed,22
NA,will remain uncertain and outbreaks of fight-,22
NA,ing cannot be ruled out. Members of the,22
NA,Australian contingent will travel often on,22
NA,minor and remote roads. They will be re-,22
NA,sponsible for the dangerous work of clearing,22
NA,mines throughout the country. Threats are,22
NA,also posed by disease and the harsh environ-,22
NA,ment. Against these dangers should be set,22
NA,the fact that our service personnel are ex-,22
NA,perts in their profession; they are well trained,22
NA,and will be armed for self-defence. I can,22
NA,assure honourable members that the safety,22
NA,of the Australian contingent is uppermost in,22
NA,my mind. To ensure that we are kept fully,22
NA,informed of developments that may affect,22
NA,"the well-being of the Australian contingerit,",22
NA,the Government has decided to establish a,22
NA,temporary Australian Liaison Office in the,22
NA,Namibian capital of Windhoek for the du-,22
NA,ration of the 12-month independence pro-,22
NA,cess. The office will provide the Government,22
NA,with first-hand reporting on political and,22
NA,"military developments in the territory, during",22
NA,what at times is likely to be a difficult pro-,22
NA,cess. The office will be headed by an expe-,22
NA,rienced diplomat with many years',22
NA,background in African affairs.,22
NA,The Government has also ensured that,23
NA,members of the Australian contingent be ad-,23
NA,equately compensated for the hardships and,23
NA,dangers they will face through a comprehen-,23
NA,"sive and generous set of conditions of service,",23
NA,including the payment of special allowances.,23
NA,"In addition, the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) will",23
NA,be seeking an amendment to the Income Tax,23
NA,Assessment Act to exempt the pay and al-,23
NA,lowances earned by Defence Force personnel,23
NA,while they are on tour with UNTAG. Re-,23
NA,patriation benefits appropriate to the tasks,23
NA,and hazards encountered will also be,23
NA,provided.,23
NA,Our contribution to UNTAG and our in-,23
NA,volvement in the Namibian settlement makes,23
NA,Australia party to what may be one of the,23
NA,United Nations' most substantial achieve-,23
NA,ments for many years. We have been in-,23
NA,volved in this process from the start.,23
NA,Australia has been a member of the UN,23
NA,Council for Namibia since 1974. We pledged,23
NA,our support for UNT AG at the inception of,23
NA,the UN plan for Namibia in 1978. Australia,23
NA,also made an important contribution to UN,23
NA,deliberations about Namibia during our re-,23
NA,cent term on the UN Security Council in,23
NA,1985-86. Our participation in UNTAG also,23
NA,builds on the constructive role successive,23
NA,Australian governments have played on,23
NA,southern African issues. I pay particular trib-,23
NA,ute to the achievements of my predecessor,23
NA,Malcolm Fraser in this regard. Our decisive,23
NA,contribution to the attainment of independ-,23
NA,"ence by Zimbabwe, Australia's leading role",23
NA,in the Commonwealth on southern Africa,23
NA,"affairs, and our bilaterial aid support for the",23
NA,member countries of the Southern African,23
NA,"Development Coordination Conference, all",23
NA,speak of a firm commitment to peace and,23
NA,stability in that region. Our involvement in,23
NA,the Eminent Persons Group was only one,23
NA,demonstration of our longstanding determi-,23
NA,nation to work constructively to bring about,23
NA,an end to the repugnant policies of apartheid.,23
NA,"I believe that the Namibian settlement,",23
NA,together with the resolution of the Iran-Iraq,23
NA,war and the end of Soviet military interven-,23
NA,"tion in Afghanistan, marks a renewal of faith",23
NA,in the United Nations as an effective partic-,23
NA,ipant in international affairs after many years,23
NA,of cynicism and apathy about its role. The,23
NA,United Nations belongs on the centre stage,23
NA,"of world affairs, not in the wings, and it is",23
NA,very encouraging that more and more coun-,23
NA,tries are recognising this. I take this oppor-,23
NA,tunity to pay tribute to the efforts of Martti,23
NA,"Ahtisaari, the United Nations Secretary-",23
NA,General's Special Representative on Nami-,23
NA,"bia, for his important role, and those of the",23
NA,"late Bernt Carlsson, the UN Commissioner",23
NA,"for Namibia, who was tragically killed in the",23
NA,Lockerbie air disaster.,23
NA,I would like to think that Namibia's tTlin-,23
NA,sition to independence will proceed to plan,23
NA,and that there will be no major setbacks.·,23
NA,But such things are never certain. Our effort,23
NA,in Namibia will be the largest peacekeeping,23
NA,commitment in which this country has ever,23
NA,participated. It may also be the most diffi-,23
NA,cult. I am sure that all honourable members,23
NA,of this House and the people of Australia,23
NA,join me in wishing our troops well in their,23
NA,endeavours. We do so in the knowledge that,23
NA,they will make an outstanding contribution,23
NA,to the future peace and prosperity of an,23
NA,independent Namibian people and a more,23
NA,stable region. I present the following paper:,23
NA,"Namibia-Ministerial statement, 6 March 1989.",23
NA,Motion (by Mr West) proposed:,23
NA,That the House take note of the paper.,23
Mr HOWARD ,Bennelong-Leader of the,23
NA,Opposition) (3.08)-The statement just made,23
NA,"by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is, ac-",23
NA,cording to any measure of parliamentary,23
NA,"statements, a very important one because it",23
NA,confirms the rare event of the dispatch of,23
NA,"Australian forces overseas to undertake, on",23
NA,"this occasion, a very difficult and a very",23
NA,important peacekeeping role. I say at the,23
NA,outset on behalf of the Opposition that we,23
NA,fully support the action of the Government,23
NA,in dispatching Australian forces to be part,23
NA,of the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping,23
NA,force in Namibia.,23
NA,As the Prime Minister properly acknowl-,23
NA,"edged, the original decision to commit Aus-",23
NA,"tralian forces, to the number of some 300",23
NA,"mainly engineering personnel, was taken in",23
NA,1978 by the former coalition Government. I,23
NA,join the Prime Minister in extending to the,23
NA,Australian forces that are to go overseas the,23
NA,very best wishes for their safety and success,23
NA,from all members of the Opposition. When,23
NA,"Australian forces go overseas in the name of,",23
NA,"and on behalf of, the Australian people, it is",23
NA,important that they know they have the,23
NA,total support of both sides of politics. On,24
NA,this occasion 1 can say unreservedly,24
NA,will. The Prime Minister is right to draw,24
NA,attention to the tortured process of achieving,24
NA,the peace arrangement in Namibia. It is 11,24
NA,years since the provisional settlement was,24
NA,concluded. At times during that process it,24
NA,must have appeared to all participants that,24
NA,it was unlikely that that original agreement,24
NA,would ever be fully consummated. Undoubtplace,24
NA,edly the general easing of East-West tension,24
NA,and a greater sense of pragmatism about,24
NA,"some of the affairs of southern Africa, from",24
NA,"both Pretoria and the front line states,",24
NA,played a role in bringing about a very sensibution,24
NA,ble arrangement.,24
NA,1 share the hope of the Prime Minister,24
NA,that the Australian forces will be there only,24
NA,for the designated period of 12 months.,24
NA,will not be an easy task. It has to be recogaware,24
NA,nised frankly on both sides of the Parliament,24
NA,that our forces can and will be exposed,24
NA,physical danger. 1 would say to the Governin,24
NA,ment that any measures introduced into this,24
NA,Parliament by the Treasurer ( Mr Keating),24
NA,to exempt the pay and allowances of Austrapowers,24
NA,lian forces from income tax will be fully,24
NA,supported by the Opposition. We will also,24
NA,be looking for the repatriation benefits,24
NA,provided appropriate to the task and the,24
NA,hazards encountered. There is no doubt that,24
NA,"this very large and important commitment,",24
NA,"as the Prime Minister said, comprises almost",24
NA,half of the Army's construction engineering,24
NA,"capacity, and careful planning has been reMinister",24
NA,quired to ensure that high priority engineerthose,24
NA,ing tasks closer to home can still be who,24
NA,performed.,24
NA,1 hope that the Prime Minister's assurof,24
NA,ances about the impact of the dispatch of,24
NA,this contingent on the Kangaroo 89 exercise world.,24
NA,"are fulfilled. If they are not, that will inev-",24
NA,itably raise serious questions about the,24
NA,of defence preparedness in Australia. We are,24
NA,second to none in giving total support to,24
NA,Government for the dispatch of these forces.,24
NA,We do not and will not in any way criticise,24
NA,the Government's decision in relation to,24
NA,"But that does not prevent, in the proper",24
NA,arena of political debate and conflict in this,24
NA,"country, the Opposition pointing out any",24
NA,deleterious consequences on the capacity of,24
NA,the remainder of the Australian defence,24
NA,forces to play an effective role in other areas,24
NA,that they of our responsibility.,24
NA,This announcement today and the dis-,24
NA,patch of the 300 Australian servicemen to,24
NA,Namibia for this peacekeeping role continues,24
NA,a long and very honourable tradition of Aus-,24
NA,tralian service personnel serving overseas in,24
NA,a variety of peacekeeping and other capaci-,24
NA,ties; and 1 welcome the fact that this takes,24
NA,under the auspices of the United Na-,24
NA,tions. 1 would have to confess to being some-,24
NA,what of a sceptic about many of the roles,24
NA,"and activities of the United Nations, but 1",24
NA,have have never demeaned the enormous contri-,24
NA,that the voluntary agencies of the,24
NA,United Nations have made to the relief of,24
NA,suffering. Anybody who has visited the ref-,24
NA,ugee camps in the Gaza and on the border,24
NA,It between Thailand and Cambodia will be well,24
NA,of the very fine work of those agen-,24
NA,"cies. There have been, as the Prime Minister",24
NA,"to properly points out, a number of examples",24
NA,"recent years of which this is one, where",24
NA,the persistent work of the United Nations,24
NA,has brought about a rational solution. It is,24
NA,true that changes in attitude by the great,24
NA,I;lnd other participants have played a,24
NA,"part, but 1 do not wish on this occasion to",24
NA,be churlish in denying the role that has been,24
NA,to be played by the United Nations.,24
NA,Let me say again that this decision by the,24
NA,Government fulfils the original commitment,24
NA,made 11 years ago by the Fraser Govern-,24
NA,ment. It has our support and 1 join the Prime,24
NA,"in extending, in the fullest possible",24
NA,"sense of the word, bipartisan good wishes for",24
NA,Australian service men and women,24
NA,will be making a very significant contri-,24
NA,bution to bringing about a greater measure,24
NA,"security, peace and stability in what has",24
NA,been and remains a very troubled part of the,24
Mr BEAZLEY ,Swan-Minister for Def-,24
NA,level ence) (3.15)-1 would like to make a num-,24
NA,ber of remarks on the statement of the Prime,24
NA,"the Minister ( Mr Hawke). First, 1 express our",24
NA,gratitude to the Opposition for its support.,24
NA,We did rather expect that it would be forth-,24
NA,that. coming and there was no surprise in that,24
NA,"regard. Nevertheless, it is gratifying to have",24
NA,it. 1 want to make two general points on the,24
NA,impact of the commitment outlined by the,24
NA,Prime Minister on the operations of the Aus-,24
NA,tralian Defence Force (ADF) and some of,24
NA,the salient features of the tasks that it will,25
NA,be performing.,25
NA,A substantial commitment has been made,25
NA,in terms of the impact of the operations on,25
NA,the section of the Army from which this,25
NA,contingent is drawn. A very substantial com-,25
NA,ponent of our engineering capability is in-,25
NA,volved. We will be able to perform this task,25
NA,to some degree because of the changes we,25
NA,"placed in our policy on reservists, and I will",25
NA,"talk a bit more about that later. But, in the",25
NA,"fullness of time, there will be a substantial",25
NA,involvement of some of our Army Reserve,25
NA,"people in this commitment, and that is only",25
NA,proper. One of the reasons that we intro-,25
NA,duced the call-out legislation relating to,25
NA,servists was to give the Army Reserve an,25
NA,opportunity to playa role in the total Army.,25
NA,A second feature I draw attention to is,25
NA,the status that is going to be accorded the,25
NA,participants in relation to benefits and more,25
NA,will be said about that by the Minister for,25
NA,Defence Science and Personnel ( Mrs Kelly).,25
NA,I would like to say something about the,25
NA,reason for that. This is a different peace-,25
NA,keeping operation from those with which we,25
NA,have been associated in the past. It is on the,25
NA,basis of that difference that determinations,25
NA,have been made. Unlike the situation in,25
NA,"Zimbabwe, the current situation associated",25
NA,with the separation of forces from the Iran-,25
NA,Iraq war or the personnel involved in Leba-,25
NA,"non, this will be an armed force. It will be",25
NA,deployed in anticipation that it may from,25
NA,time to time experience trouble. This is not,25
NA,"expected, but there is that possibility and,",25
NA,"hence, it will be a force that carries arms.",25
NA,"will, of course, also directly confront prob-",25
NA,lems which will endanger the lives of the,25
NA,"personnel concerned. For example, it has as",25
NA,one of its tasks the clearance of minefields.,25
NA,Australian servicemen have been serving,25
NA,as observers and peacekeepers continuously,25
NA,"since 1947 in Indonesia, the Middle East,",25
NA,Kashmir and Zimbabwe. Today we have 28,25
NA,Army officers in the Middle East serving,25
NA,with the United Nations truce supervision,25
NA,organisation and with the United Nations,25
NA,Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. Our,25
NA,largest peacekeeping commitment until now,25
NA,"was in Zimbabwe, where about 150 Austra-",25
NA,lian servicemen monitored the disengagement,25
NA,of opposition forces in Zimbabwe's civil war.,25
NA,The 303 members of our United Nations,25
NA,Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG),25
NA,"deployment are, therefore, by a large margin",25
NA,"our biggest peacekeeping effort yet, and it is",25
NA,probably our most difficult. We certainly had,25
NA,plenty of notice. The Army has had engi-,25
NA,neers on stand-by to join UNTAG since,25
NA,"1979. Nonetheless, the scale of the deploy-",25
NA,"ment, the tough conditions in which they",25
NA,will operate and the importance of the task,25
NA,all make this a challenging undertaking.,25
NA,Our contingent of 303 men will be made,25
NA,up of two main elements. The headquarters,25
NA,element of about 50 men-the Headquarters,25
NA,Chief Engineer UNT AG-will be part of,25
NA,"UNTAG headquarters in Windhoek, the",25
NA,re- capital of Namibia. The main body of our,25
NA,contingent comes from 17 Construction,25
NA,"Squadron, based at Holsworthy in New South",25
NA,Wales. The squadron consists of two con-,25
NA,"struction troops, a resources troop, a plant",25
NA,"troop and afield troop. As well, the squad-",25
NA,ron will have a full workshop unit and com-,25
NA,munications and medical support. The 17,25
NA,Construction Squadron and its workshop will,25
NA,be based at Grootfontein in northern Nami-,25
NA,"bia, close to the Angolan border, but it may",25
NA,be called on to operate anywhere in Namibia,25
NA,and perhaps in neighbouring countries. The,25
NA,Australian contingent will be commanded by,25
NA,"Colonel Richard Warren, a highly trained",25
NA,and widely experienced engineer officer who,25
NA,had served throughout Australia and in,25
NA,Papua New Guinea. In Namibia he will serve,25
NA,"as the Chief Engineer, UNT AG, as well as",25
NA,Commander of the Australian contingent.,25
NA,The second in command of the Australian,25
NA,contingent is Lieutenant-Colonel Kevin,25
NA,It Pippard who will serve as senior operations,25
NA,staff officer to Colonel Warren at UNTAG,25
NA,headquarters. The 17th Construction Squad-,25
NA,ron at Grootfontein will be commanded by,25
NA,"a Major David Crago, whose previous post-",25
NA,ings have included service with the Com-,25
NA,monwealth monitoring force in Zimbabwe in,25
NA,1979-80.,25
NA,The contingent will deploy with its own,25
NA,heavy equipment. The main items' of equip-,25
NA,"ment to be shipped include 24 Land Rovers,",25
NA,"19 Unimog all-terrain vehicles, 26 heavy",25
NA,"trucks, 43 trailers, 8 bulldozers and a range",25
NA,"of other road making plant such as graders,",25
NA,scrapers and rollers. The supporting work-,25
NA,"shop will require a further 40 vehicles, and",25
NA,"over 1,800 tonnes of stores will be shipped",25
NA,with the contingent's equipment. The ad-,25
NA,vance party of the contingent will leave Aus-,26
NA,tralia this week. The heavy equipment and,26
NA,stores will be loaded for transport by sea,26
NA,about the middle of March. The main body,26
NA,of the contingent is scheduled to leave on,26
NA,17 March. Those members will fly to NamiIt,26
NA,bia by United States transport aircraft.,26
NA,The Prime Minister has already indicated,26
NA,that our troops will find in Namibia an un-,26
NA,"certain political and military situation, and",26
NA,"harsh and unforgiving terrain. In recent years,",26
NA,Namibia has been subject to a very complex,26
NA,series of interconnecting conflicts. In the,26
NA,"instance, the South West Africa People's",26
NA,ganisation (SWAPO) has been fighting the,26
NA,"South African armed forces, both in Namibia",26
NA,and from bases in neighbouring Angola and,26
NA,"Zambia. In recent years, South Africans",26
NA,recruited Namibians into the South-West Afof,26
NA,rican Territorial (SWAT) Force to support,26
NA,them in fighting SWAPO.,26
NA,"Meanwhile, events in Namibia have been",26
NA,heavily influenced from across the border,26
NA,"Angola. The Angolan Government, sup-",26
NA,"ported by up to 50,000 Cuban troops, have",26
NA,been fighting an insurgency based in the,26
NA,south-east of the country by the National,26
NA,Union for the Total Independence of Angola,26
NA,(UNITA). UNITA has been aided by the,26
NA,"South African Government, while SWAPO",26
NA,has been aided by the Angolan Government.,26
NA,"As an additional complication, Angola has",26
NA,been providing refuge and support to the,26
NA,African National Congress in its fight against,26
NA,the regime in South Africa. UNT AG has,26
NA,difficult and complex task in helping to,26
NA,tangle this complex situation. It will mdnitor,26
NA,the cessation of hostilities by' all parties,26
NA,the implementation of the transition to,26
NA,dependence for Namibia. UNT AG's military,26
NA,component will play a vital role in this,26
NA,process.,26
NA,Under the UN plan a cease-fire is already,26
NA,in place before UNTAG's arrival. During,26
NA,the 12 weeks following the arrival of UNcould,26
NA,"TAG, all but 1,500 South African troops",26
NA,will be withdrawn from Namibia and the,26
NA,remainder will be confined to camps. At the,26
NA,same time SW APO forces inside Namibia,26
NA,"will be confined to their camps, and those",26
NA,Angola and Zambia will be restricted to,26
NA,bases there. Unarmed SWAPO personnel and,26
NA,other Namibians outside the territory will be,26
NA,able to return to participate in the election.,26
NA,The military component of UNT AG will,26
NA,"be required to monitor, and if necessary en-",26
NA,"in force, this complex cease-fire and disengage-",26
NA,ment. It will need to keep borders under,26
NA,surveillance to prevent infiltration of forces.,26
NA,will be responsible for disarming and dis-,26
NA,"banding citizen forces such as SWAT Force,",26
NA,ensuring that all military installations along,26
NA,.the northern border are deactivated or placed,26
NA,a under UN supervision and providing security,26
NA,for vital installations in the northern border,26
NA,"areas. As well, it will be required to assist",26
NA,first and support the civilian component of UN-,26
NA,OrTAG in managing the constitutional and,26
NA,"electoral processes, and respond to any spe-",26
NA,cial requests from the UN special represent-,26
NA,ative to help to maintain law and order.,26
NA,have UNT AG's military component will consist,26
NA,"three infantry battalions of 850 men each,",26
NA,"300 military observers, 1,700 logistic troops",26
NA,"and a headquarters staff of 100, making a",26
NA,"total of 4,650 men. Should it become appar-",26
NA,"ent that this is insufficient for the task, the",26
NA,"in force can be expanded to 7,500.",26
NA,"Clearly, mobility will be fundamental to",26
NA,the effectiveness of UNT AG. Our contin-,26
NA,gent's key task will be to maintain that mo-,26
NA,bility in what will often be very difficult,26
NA,"circumstances. Hence, the tasks envisaged",26
NA,for the Australian engineers in support of,26
NA,"this force include mine clearing, maintaining",26
NA,roads and tracks and building and maintain-,26
NA,ing light aircraft strips and helipads. They,26
NA,will also be .called upon to help with water,26
NA,"a supplies, to construct rough camp accom-",26
NA,unmodation and to build field defences. As the,26
NA,"Prime Minister has said, these are clearly",26
NA,and tasks which carry some risks. We all hope,26
NA,inand expect that all parties to the complex,26
NA,conflict in south-west Africa will abide by,26
NA,the terms of the Namibia settlement. With,26
NA,. such a large number of competing forces and,26
NA,"conflicting interests, it is possible that trouble",26
NA,could break out and that UNTAG members,26
NA,become involved. Apart from the risk,26
NA,"of combat, Australian forces will face danger",26
NA,from mine clearing and disease and from the,26
NA,harsh and arid climate of south-west Africa.,26
NA,Against these dangers need to be set the,26
NA,in skill and professionalism of our defence,26
NA,"their forces. UNT AG members, including the",26
NA,"Australian contingent, will be armed for self-",26
NA,defence. Our engineers are specialists in mine,26
NA,clearance. They have been carefully trained,26
NA,and equipped for this work. Every care is,27
NA,"being taken to ensure the safety, health and",27
NA,"welfare of our soldiers. Nonetheless, the ADF",27
NA,and the Government accept that there may,27
NA,be casualties among our contingent. We re-,27
NA,cognise the dedication of our contingent,27
NA,"members, who accept these risks as part of",27
NA,their duties and a concomitant of a profes-,27
NA,sion of arms. The Government has decided,27
NA,that because the potential risks of service in,27
NA,Namibia may be higher than for previous,27
NA,"peacekeeping operations, a more generous",27
NA,level of compensation should be paid to our,27
NA,soldiers serving with UNTAG. The Govern-,27
NA,ment has decided that because of the signif-,27
NA,"icant risks involved, the members of our",27
NA,Namibia contingent will receive appropriate,27
NA,"recompense, including a substantial allow-",27
NA,"ance, and that their full pay and allowances",27
NA,will be tax-free while they are in Namibia.,27
NA,This is in fact the most generous package,27
NA,of allowances and conditions offered to Aus-,27
NA,tralian servicemen abroad since the Vietnam,27
NA,War. My colleague the Minister for Defence,27
NA,"Science and Personnel, who has been respon-",27
NA,"sible for putting this package together, will",27
NA,be giving fuller details later in this debate.,27
NA,am confident that all honourable members,27
NA,will agree that these conditions are a fitting,27
NA,recognition of the service to be undertaken,27
NA,by our soldiers in Namibia.,27
NA,Australian soldiers will serve in Namibia,27
NA,for tours of six months. The UN plans to,27
NA,bring Namibia to independence within one,27
NA,year. We are committed to maintain our,27
NA,UNTAG contingent for that period. At least,27
NA,one rotation will therefore be necessary.,27
NA,"However, it may be that delays in the imple-",27
NA,mentation of the transition plan for Namibia,27
NA,"could occur, which might require UNT AG",27
NA,to stay in place longer than a year. The,27
NA,"government would, of course, then have to",27
NA,review our commitment in the light of all,27
NA,the circumstances.,27
NA,Our UNTAG contingent accounts for,27
NA,nearly half of our construction engineer ca-,27
NA,pability and their deployment to Namibia,27
NA,will affect the engineering resources closer to,27
NA,home. Our engineers perform a lot of impor-,27
NA,tant work in Australia and in our region.,27
NA,Among the activities which had been planned,27
NA,for our engineers are a number of high prior-,27
NA,ity defence cooperation program (DCP),27
NA,projects in the south-west Pacific and Papua,27
NA,"New Guinea, including a new police head-",27
NA,"quarters in Vanuatu, a new wharf on Manus",27
NA,"Island in Papua New Guinea, and studies for",27
NA,the establishment of a new base for the,27
NA,Papua New Guinea defence forces air ele-,27
NA,ment in Port Moresby. All of these projects,27
NA,will be able to go ahead unaffected by the,27
NA,UNTAG deployment. Another major task,27
NA,for our engineers is participation in Kanga-,27
NA,roo 89. Here the departure of 17 Construc-,27
NA,"tion Squadron will have some impact, but",27
NA,the Army is planning to use reserves more,27
NA,fully to make up the gap. I might say that I,27
NA,"am very pleased, as I said before, that two",27
NA,reservists are among our first deployment to,27
NA,Namibia and that others will follow. I be-,27
NA,lieve this demonstrates in a concrete fashion,27
NA,our determination to integrate the reserves,27
NA,fully into the Army and treat them as the,27
NA,serious soldiers that they are. I conclude by,27
NA,joining the Prime Minister and the Leader,27
NA,of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) in wishing,27
NA,the men of our first Namibia contingent well,27
NA,in their important work.,27
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England-Leader,27
NA,of the National Party of Australia) (3.28)-,27
NA,II share the good wishes extended to those,27
NA,who are about to serve in the United Na-,27
NA,"tions Transitional Assistance Group, the",27
NA,"UNTAG Corps, by the Prime Minister ( Mr",27
NA,"Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr",27
NA,Howard) and the Minister for Defence ( Mr,27
NA,Beazley). I do not think there is any more,27
NA,significant decision by this Parliament than,27
NA,the decision to send armed forces abroad.,27
NA,"This is a significant decision and, albeit that",27
NA,"it comes 11 years after the original decision,",27
NA,it is one which now has a prime bearing on,27
NA,those personnel about to serve in Namibia.,27
NA,There are three aspects of the service that I,27
NA,wish to address: the role of peacekeeping,27
NA,forces and their role in southern Africa; the,27
NA,effect on the Australian Defence Force,27
NA,(ADF); and the protection of the rights of,27
NA,serving personnel and their dependants.,27
NA,"First, with respect to peacekeeping forces,",27
NA,"I was very critical, and remain critical, of",27
NA,the Government's decision to withdraw the,27
NA,multinational force from the Sinai. I well,27
NA,understand the reason for the return of the,27
NA,rotary wing element and comprehend the,27
NA,advantage to the mobility of the Australian,27
NA,"Defence Force, in particular the Operational",27
NA,"Deployment Force (ODF), of that helicop-",27
NA,"ter facility. Nonetheless, I believe there",28
NA,other roles that could have been played there.,28
NA,Australia has served and is serving in a,28
NA,number of other joint forces around the,28
NA,world. I think it is commendable that yet,28
NA,again the United Nations (UN) in this in-,28
NA,stance has been prepared to act and it is the,28
NA,more commendable because it seems the So-,28
NA,viet veto has not been applied as it has on a,28
NA,"number of occasions. We recall that, because",28
NA,"of the Soviet veto, it was necessary to form",28
NA,a multinational force and observers (MFO),28
NA,rather than a UN force when the Sinai com-,28
NA,"mitment was entered into. There is, without",28
NA,"any doubt, for Australia a very real respon-",28
NA,sibility to act as a neutral country where we,28
NA,can to assist in trying to ensure peace be-,28
NA,tween other nations. The Opposition parties,28
NA,see this as an entirely appropriate part of,28
NA,the role of the ADF. It is in that respect,28
NA,that we made this initial commitment and,28
NA,commend the Government for pursuing it.,28
NA,With respect to the role in southern Af-,28
NA,"rica, the situation there is difficult. Indeed,",28
NA,one of the elements that I noticed absent,28
NA,from the Prime Minister's statement-and it,28
NA,has not been adverted to by the Minister for,28
NA,Defence-is the very large number of Cuban,28
NA,troops that have been serving in the area.,28
NA,"There is a requirement that, by 1 August, all",28
NA,"47,000 Cuban troops must be north of the",28
NA,fifteenth parallel. That is a large number of,28
NA,personnel. We need to understand that the,28
NA,UNTAG group is a very small element and,28
NA,much will depend on the goodwill of those,28
NA,other personnel-not just the Cuban troops,28
NA,but also the group that has been referred to,28
NA,by the Minister within the South West Af-,28
NA,rica People's Organisation. We know that,28
NA,SWAPO has been guilty of continued insur-,28
NA,"gency activities, in violation of the New York",28
NA,"agreements, along the border of Angola and",28
NA,"south-west Africa. There has been, appar-",28
NA,"ently, a building up of about 4,800 SWAPO",28
NA,members in various camps.,28
NA,It is an extraordinarily sensitive part of,28
NA,the responsibility of UNTAG to try to con-,28
NA,trol a large number of forces whose acts in,28
NA,the past have not suggested that they are,28
NA,prepared to meet the general obligations of,28
NA,"the peace accords, although I believe that at",28
NA,least to date the Cuban troops are acting in,28
NA,accordance with their obligations. One can,28
NA,only hope that within the responsibility of,28
NA,"were the UNTAG group, which is to monitor the",28
NA,"peace process, there will be an ability for it",28
NA,"to act as one would wish, given its size and",28
NA,the inevitable limitations of any peacekeep-,28
NA,"ing force. Indeed, one commends those in",28
NA,the United Nations who have been respon-,28
NA,sible for putting together this element.,28
NA,"For Australia, however, it is a risky oper-",28
NA,ation. One would be foolish to think there is,28
NA,not an element of risk in our service in,28
NA,Namibia. This has been acknowledged by the,28
NA,Prime Minister and now by the Minister for,28
NA,Defence. It is in that respect that we all,28
NA,need to understand the nature of service in,28
NA,the Australian Defence Force. It is in that,28
NA,area that my own concern is paramount. We,28
NA,know from the Prime Minister's statement,28
NA,that about half of the engineering capacity,28
NA,of the Australian Defence Force will go to,28
NA,Namibia. We have been told by the Minister,28
NA,for Defence that two reservists will be in this,28
NA,first detachment. While we entirely endorse,28
NA,the integration of reservists with the Austra-,28
NA,"lian Defence Force, and hence their dispatch",28
NA,"and participation, through the amendment",28
NA,"to the call-out legislation, I believe there is a",28
NA,problem be.::ause of the nature of demands,28
NA,that could be brought to bear on the ADF,28
NA,and other areas.,28
NA,The Prime Minister's statement refers to,28
NA,the defence cooperation program in the Pa-,28
NA,cific. It is not only that obligation overseas,28
NA,which might require a commitment from the,28
NA,Australian Defence Force; from media re-,28
NA,ports it seems that the Government has made,28
NA,"an initial suggestion that up to 1,000 Austra-",28
NA,lian Defence Force personnel might partici-,28
NA,pate in any cooperative peace force involved,28
NA,in Cambodia. We also know of an approach,28
NA,by the Government of Papua New Guinea,28
NA,for Australian Defence Force personnel to,28
NA,"be posted there. In other words, quite apart",28
NA,"from this obligation, there are at least two",28
NA,possible commitments which will draw fur-,28
NA,ther on the ADF. When that is measured,28
NA,against the record rate of resignations and,28
NA,the Australian Labor Party's attitude to-,28
NA,"wards the Defence Force, which has not",28
NA,shown care for and attention to the person-,28
NA,"nel of the Australian Defence Force, one",28
NA,can only be apprehensive about the impact,28
NA,this will have on the Australian Defence,28
NA,Force's ability not only to meet those exter-,28
NA,nal obligations but also to maintain the train-,28
NA,ing program and the high standards expected,29
NA,in its preparedness and ability to service the,29
NA,new equipment acquired by it within Aus-,29
NA,tralia and within the ADF's other broader,29
NA,commitments.,29
NA,Of course this is particularly significant,29
NA,far as the Army is concerned. Over the 12,29
NA,months to which the Prime Minister's state-,29
NA,"ment refers, every member of the engineer-",29
NA,ing corps will be serving in Namibia. As half,29
NA,will go in the first element and half in the,29
NA,second-even though there might be some,29
NA,"drawing on reservists, and one needs to un-",29
NA,derstand that inevitably there is some turn-,29
NA,over-every member of the engineering corps,29
NA,will serve in Namibia. While that is excellent,29
NA,"in experience terms, the reality is that num-",29
NA,bers in the Australian Army are inadequate,29
NA,to meet the sorts of obligations that this,29
NA,overseas commitment places on them. There,29
NA,has been 11 years notice. Over that time one,29
NA,would have hoped that there could have,29
NA,been a recognition that there might well,29
NA,"need to be, therefore, some build-up of the",29
NA,engineering force so that it is not stretched,29
NA,"to the limit, as I suggest it might be. The",29
NA,Minister has said that there will be no effect,29
NA,"on Kangaroo 89, nor on domestic ability. I",29
NA,put it to him that in the circumstances of,29
NA,such an extraordinarily large commitment it,29
NA,will be very hard for the Army to meet its,29
NA,domestic commitments not only in Kangaroo,29
NA,89 but in the defence cooperation program,29
NA,"and certainly, if additional commitments are",29
NA,"required, in either Cambodia or Papua New",29
NA,Guinea.,29
NA,"Perhaps the most significant element, how-",29
NA,"ever, of Opposition concern is our worry",29
NA,about the extent to which the protection of,29
NA,rights of serving personnel and their depen-,29
NA,"dants, if any injury should occur, is covered",29
NA,by the Government. I understand that the,29
NA,area is to be declared a war zone. I remain,29
NA,to be advised whether the service will be,29
NA,declared operational. I also heard no refer-,29
NA,ence in the comments of either the Minister,29
NA,or the Prime Minister to the present terms,29
NA,of the Commonwealth Employees Compen-,29
NA,"sation Act which largely, in many instances,",29
NA,has replaced the overall embrace of cover,29
NA,"for veterans. One needs to understand, if",29
NA,"there should be death-sadly, we know that",29
NA,there was one in the United Nations forces,29
NA,in Lebanon a little while ago-that those,29
NA,who serve abroad in the Australian uniform,29
NA,on behalf of this country need to be offered,29
NA,a more secure and better package than that,29
NA,which is available to anybody who serves,29
NA,within Australia.,29
NA,"Certainly, for those who are serving in the",29
NA,"as UNT AG group, there should be a require-",29
NA,ment on the part of this Government to,29
NA,provide at least as generous a package of,29
NA,entitlements on their return-or for their,29
NA,"dependants, should anything tragic happen",29
NA,to them-that ensures that they and their,29
NA,dependants are protected. I trust that the,29
NA,Minister for Defence Science and Personnel,29
NA,( Mrs Kelly) will cover this aspect in her,29
NA,statement. We need to know whether the,29
NA,Government will declare the zone opera-,29
NA,tional; the impact on dependants of the pres-,29
NA,ent package within the Commonwralth,29
NA,Employees Compensation Act; and whether,29
NA,veterans' entitlements will be available to the,29
NA,full degree that they were available in,29
NA,Vietnam.,29
NA,The whole of the character of what I have,29
NA,seen and heard suggests-as does the reser-,29
NA,vation in the comments of the Minister for,29
NA,Defence-that the Government is not being,29
NA,as forthcoming as it should be. In the Op-,29
NA,position's mind that is totally unacceptable,29
NA,"because there is, without any doubt, a neces-",29
NA,sity for those who are serving in these cir-,29
NA,cumstances to be fully covered and fully,29
NA,"protected, as should be their dependants. I",29
NA,say to those who are serving and who wiIl,29
NA,serve that members of the National Party,29
NA,join other members who have spoken in,29
NA,wishing them well and commend them for,29
NA,their professionalism and the high standards,29
NA,"which we know they will achieve, and trust",29
NA,that they all return to this country in a 100,29
NA,per cent healthy state.,29
Mrs KELLY ,Canberra-Minister for,29
NA,Defence Science arid Personnel) (3.38)-1,29
NA,thank the House for the cooperative spirit in,29
NA,which this issue has been debated. As the,29
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Minis-,29
NA,"ter for Defence ( Mr Beazley) have said,",29
NA,uniformed Australians have an outstanding,29
NA,record in United Nations (UN) peacekeep-,29
NA,"ing forces. From Korea to Cyprus, to Leba-",29
NA,"non and Iran, Australian police and military",29
NA,personnel have been keeping the peace. Often,29
NA,"that peace has been uneasy and fragile, as",29
NA,the battles of long time enemies have flared,29
NA,up again along disputed borders or between,29
NA,traditional rivals. Keeping the peace in,30
NA,"bled lands, trying to implement on the ground",30
NA,the complex strategies of mediators and endetails,30
NA,"voys, is no sinecure: it is tough, difficult",30
NA,enormously valuable work.,30
NA,The peace plan for Namibia has been long,30
NA,"in the making, as the Prime Minister and",30
NA,"Minister for Defence have said, and much",30
NA,"delayed in its implementation. Now, after lO",30
NA,"years, it is time for the plan to be tested;",30
NA,is time for the Australian Defence Force,30
NA,(ADF) to make its contribution; and it will.,30
NA,It is a contribution from all Australians,30
NA,tangible evidence of our commitment,30
NA,peace in the world. For the 300 men who contingent.,30
NA,"are going to Namibia, it is a very personal",30
NA,commitment. I have visited the Namibian has,30
NA,"contingent twice, accompanied on my most",30
NA,recent visit by my colleague the Minister,30
NA,NA,30
NA,was most impressed with the calibre of the,30
NA,"troops we are sending, the quality of their",30
NA,"leadership and equipment, and their good",30
NA,spirits and high morale. Colonel Richard,30
NA,"Warren and his second-in-command, Lieuthe",30
NA,"tenant-Colonel Kevin Pippard, were in New",30
NA,York attending the United Nations Transipayable,30
NA,tional Assistance Group (UNTAG) contintransfer,30
NA,"gent commanders brief, but Colonel Peter",30
NA,"Rose, the Commandant of the Land Comin",30
NA,"mand engineers, took me around, along with",30
NA,"Major David Crago, who is leading the 238",30
NA,"men of the 17th Construction Squadron,",30
NA,"UNT AG, to Namibia. I must say that I was",30
NA,particularly impressed with the leadership,30
NA,the officers who wi11lead this contingent.,30
NA,I was invited to a lunch at,30
NA,where I had a chance to meet members of,30
NA,the contingent and talk with them about,30
NA,their concerns and feelings on the eve of,30
NA,their deployment. They all knew that they,30
NA,were going into danger. No doubt for many,30
NA,of them there was regret at the thought,30
NA,leaving their families behind. But all were,30
NA,quite clear about one thing above all: that,30
NA,they were going to Namibia for a good,30
NA,"son, for a really worthwhile purpose. They",30
NA,take with them all our best wishes and our,30
NA,unanimous support. Along with our goodbe,30
NA,"will, they deserve tangible evidence that we",30
NA,appreciate what they are doing for us and,30
NA,for the cause of peace in the world.,30
NA,A package of conditions has been agreed,30
NA,on that recognises the unique and special,30
NA,troucharacter of the circumstances that these,30
NA,men will face in Africa. I will go into the,30
NA,"of the allowances in a moment, but I",30
NA,and begin by expressing my pleasure at the ef-,30
NA,forts that will go into providing for the fam-,30
NA,ilies of the men who are going to Namibia.,30
NA,the Members of the contingent will be eligible,30
NA,for up to seven days of pre-embarkation,30
NA,leave to finalise their personal affairs and to,30
NA,it make their farewells before they go. They,30
NA,will be able to keep in touch with their,30
NA,families and loved ones while they are in,30
NA,and Namibia and Defence will meet the cost of,30
NA,to postage to and from members of the,30
NA,"A support network, known as network 17,",30
NA,been established to assist families. Based,30
NA,at No. 1 Construction Regiment at Holswor-,30
NA,"for thy, the network includes a 008 information",30
NA,I service which families can ring for advice,30
NA,and support. The families already have been,30
NA,called in. They have met with the officers,30
NA,and have had a full brief in regard to contact,30
NA,and the sort of support they will have. So,30
NA,support network is already well in place.,30
NA,Normal Defence Force allowances will be,30
NA,to members of the contingent. The,30
NA,allowance of between $335 and $4lO,30
NA,"per member, depending on whether he lived",30
NA,"barracks or outside prior to departure,",30
NA,will be paid. Separation allowance for those,30
NA,who are separated from their families will be,30
NA,paid. Members of the contingent also will be,30
NA,eligible for an outlay allowance and an inter-,30
NA,"of est-free loan of $1,500 to assist in meeting",30
NA,costs associated with establishing themselves,30
NA,"Holsworthy, in an overseas country.",30
NA,In Namibia the contingent will be divided,30
NA,into two groups: the headquarters staff in,30
NA,barracks in the capital and those who will,30
NA,"be out in the field, mainly along the northern",30
NA,. border. The headquarters staff will receive a,30
NA,of special Namibia allowance of $22 a day. On,30
NA,"top of this, the United Nations allowance of",30
NA,$1.52 is payable. Headquarters staff will pay,30
NA,rearations and quarters charges at the Win-,30
NA,dhoek barracks through the commanding of-,30
NA,"ficer, although the commanding officer will",30
NA,empowered to waive these charges if he,30
NA,finds the conditions there to be substandard.,30
NA,No rations and quarters charges will be paid,30
NA,by members of the contingent out in the,30
NA,field and their special allowance for Namibia,30
NA,will be paid at the rate of $35 a day as well,30
NA,as the UN allowance. These rates will be,31
NA,"reviewed, but not diminished, soon after the",31
NA,contingent deploys to Namibia.,31
NA,Allowances payable to members of the,31
NA,contingent will vary from $335 plus $23.52,31
NA,a day for single members serving at head-,31
NA,quarters to $410 plus $39.96 a day for a,31
NA,married member posted to the forward areas.,31
NA,The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has agreed that,31
NA,all pay and allowances for members of UN-,31
NA,TAG will be free of tax. The decision dates,31
NA,from 18 February and the Treasurer will be,31
NA,seeking an amendment to section 23A (c) of,31
NA,the Income Tax Assessment Act to give ef-,31
NA,fect to it. I would like to thank members of,31
NA,the House for their support of that initiative.,31
NA,"Particularly, I would like to pay tribute to",31
NA,the Treasurer for his support. The Treasurer,31
NA,has proved by this decision that this Govern-,31
NA,ment is committed to the UN peacekeeping,31
NA,force. This is no empty gesture; it is a real,31
NA,"and determined decision, which I welcome",31
NA,most warmly.,31
NA,Honourable members opposite raised the,31
NA,issue of repatriation benefits. These benefits,31
NA,will be appropriate to the task and hazards,31
NA,that the contingent will meet. Currently we,31
NA,are examining the various options. Ob-,31
NA,"viously, there are two categories: operational",31
NA,"and peacekeeping. Basically, I am looking at",31
NA,trying to provide the best conditions possible,31
NA,for these people. Some people argue that,31
NA,better conditions are offered under the,31
NA,peacekeeping category. Others argue that,31
NA,better conditions exist under the operational,31
NA,category. Much will depend on the circum-,31
NA,"stances, As a minimum, these conditions will",31
NA,include: normal benefits under part 4 of the,31
NA,Veterans' Entitlements Act; 24-hour any oc-,31
NA,currence cover for death or· invalidity bene-,31
NA,fits while outside Australia; coverage under,31
NA,the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilita-,31
NA,tion and Compensation Act for 28 days after,31
NA,return; favourable standards of proof for,31
NA,cases; and limited rights to sue at common,31
NA,"law. These are just the basic conditions and,",31
NA,"as I said, we are looking in detail at the",31
NA,categories that they should fall into. The best,31
NA,interests of the troops are being taken into,31
NA,"consideration, bearing in mind the threat",31
NA,scenario that they are going to be facing. No,31
NA,package of conditions can fully compensate,31
NA,for the hazards that Australia's contingent of,31
NA,"UNTAG will be walking into, but conditions",31
NA,like the ones I have outlined are designed to,31
NA,take account of the difficulties that can be,31
NA,predicted and the separation from families,31
NA,and loved ones that necessarily accompany,31
NA,deployment such as this.,31
NA,The Australian contingent to UNTAG will,31
NA,soon be deployed. To the 300 men directly,31
NA,"involved, I extend my best wishes and per-",31
NA,sonal thanks. They are joining a proud group,31
NA,"of Australians, including my father, who,",31
NA,"many years ago, was a member of the peace-",31
NA,keeping force in Cyprus. These men over the,31
NA,years have genuinely fought for peace. I wish,31
NA,them all the best of luck in their role of,31
NA,mediating in an area that has known the,31
NA,ravages of war for so many years. I wish,31
NA,them a safe return. I hope that their families,31
NA,feel compensated in some way by the pack-,31
NA,ages we have allowed. I hope that the serv-,31
NA,icemen feel that at least this Government is,31
NA,looking after them and their families. They,31
NA,"go in the hope, though not in the certain",31
NA,"knowledge, of succeeding in their mission.",31
NA,The heartfelt good wishes of all peaceloving,31
NA,Australians and of everyone dedicated to the,31
NA,ideals of the UN everywhere go with the,31
NA,ADF contingent to be deployed to Namibia.,31
Mr SPENDER ,North Sydney) (3.48)-,31
NA,"I shall be brief. I welcome, as other speakers",31
NA,"have, the decision to give effect to a decision",31
NA,taken in principle many years ago by the,31
NA,"Fraser Government, of which the Leader of",31
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Howard) and the Leader,31
NA,of National Party of Australia ( Mr Sinclair),31
NA,"were both members, to support, effectively",31
NA,"through Australian troops, the peace process",31
NA,"in Namibia. Namibia is large in size, small",31
NA,in population and impoverished. Like so,31
NA,"many other African countries, it has been",31
NA,afflicted not simply by poverty but by man-,31
NA,made disasters of one kind or another. In,31
NA,"particular, it has been bedevilled by",31
NA,insurgency.,31
NA,I am glad that we are going to see the,31
NA,removal of foreign troops. I am also glad,31
NA,that the South African Government appears,31
NA,to be taking a more realistic approach to,31
NA,some of the foreign policy issues on its bor-,31
NA,der. We on this side of the House look,31
NA,forward in particular to the eventual with-,31
NA,"drawal from Africa of all Cuban troops who,",31
NA,"as the arm of the Soviets, have been so",31
NA,responsible for so much of the armed devas-,31
NA,tation that has bedevilled sub-Saharan Africa.,31
NA,"Australia's role is an important one, as has",32
NA,been pointed out by all speakers. I join the,32
NA,Leader of the National Party in hoping that,32
NA,our involvement in Namibia will not over-,32
NA,stretch our forces. I notice that in his state-,32
NA,"ment to the House, in reference to the 300",32
NA,"men that we are sending to Namibia, the",32
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said:,32
NA,This is a very large and important commitment for,32
NA,"Australia, comprising almost half of the Army's con-",32
NA,"struction engineering capabilities. Careful planning,",32
NA,"including the use of Reservists, has been required to",32
NA,ensure that high-priority engineering tasks closer to,32
NA,home can still be performed.,32
NA,I emphasise that in this case careful plan-,32
NA,"ning, including the use of reservists, was nec-",32
NA,essary for the purposes of leaving available,32
NA,the capability of high priority engineering,32
NA,tasks closer to home. It is a pity that our,32
NA,forces are in that state.,32
NA,"I acknowledge, as other members have,",32
NA,the difficulties that this process is going to,32
NA,face. The timetable looks for independence,32
NA,in a year's time and the establishment of,32
NA,democratic government. I am sorry to say,32
NA,that the record of democratic government in,32
NA,Africa has been a sad one. I hope that on,32
NA,this occasion a democratic government will,32
NA,be established and will be able to flourish.,32
NA,Let me say one other thing about some of,32
NA,the disasters that have bedevilled Africa.,32
NA,"When we speak about Africa-indeed, when",32
NA,we speak about any other part of the world-,32
NA,"in terms of rights and abuses, we need per-",32
NA,haps to take a broader view and not be as,32
NA,selective as this Government has been in its,32
NA,approach to southern African affairs. We,32
NA,join the Government unequivocally in con-,32
NA,demning apartheid. The reasons for that con-,32
NA,demnation are well known and have been,32
NA,stated again and again by speakers from this,32
NA,side of the House.,32
NA,We think that more attention should be,32
NA,paid to some of the other manmade disasters,32
NA,in the sub-Saharan area of southern Africa.,32
NA,I will give one example. In August of last,32
NA,year in Burundi the majority Tutsis slaugh-,32
NA,"tered some 25,000 minority Hutus. In con-",32
NA,trast to the language of denunciation on,32
NA,South African affairs-and I am not quar-,32
NA,relling about the language of denunciation,32
NA,when it comes to apartheid but I do quarrel,32
NA,"about selectivity in weight, however-the",32
NA,Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Sen-,32
NA,ator Gareth Evans) answered a total of one,32
NA,question on this dreadful outrage. Twenty-,32
NA,five thousand people were slaughtered. It,32
NA,passed almost unnoticed by this Govern-,32
NA,ment. When asked a question on notice by,32
NA,Senator Chaney-a question put down on,32
NA,the Notice Paper-about whether Australia,32
NA,would look into what concerted international,32
NA,action might be possible over Burundi the,32
NA,"Minister's response was nothing, zero. There",32
NA,was no answer after many months. One,32
NA,would think that if this deep concern for the,32
NA,"people of Burundi is felt, as it should be, the",32
NA,Minister could bother to get around to an-,32
NA,swering a question on that subject. I ask him,32
NA,"and other members of the Government, in",32
NA,the spirit of the bipartisan and sensible ap-,32
NA,proach to these important foreign policy is-,32
NA,"sues, to look to the other issues as well in",32
NA,sub-Saharan Africa.,32
NA,The Prime Minister has welcomed the in-,32
NA,volvement of the work of the United Na-,32
NA,tions in this case. We certainly welcome more,32
NA,effective work from the United Nations. But,32
NA,we need to understand that effective work,32
NA,from the United Nations depends on con-,32
NA,"structive diplomacy from the Soviet Union,",32
NA,especially at the Security Council level. It is,32
NA,good to see that in some respects changes,32
NA,have been noted in the way in which the,32
NA,Soviet Union is approaching a number of,32
NA,foreign policy issues as it reassesses its own,32
NA,position in the world and its own internal,32
NA,position. But we need to remember that the,32
NA,United Nations is a meeting ground of na-,32
NA,tions and that its success is not dependent,32
NA,on some kind of mystical quality that can be,32
NA,attributed to the United Nations but is de-,32
NA,pendent crucially on the constructive in-,32
NA,volvement and cooperation of the major,32
NA,"countries. It was the Soviet Union, at the",32
NA,"Security Council level, which for decades",32
NA,was the major preponderant bloc to success-,32
NA,ful work in the Security Council.,32
NA,What we are seeing is a first step. We,32
NA,hope it will be a successful step towards,32
NA,democratic government. We welcome again,32
NA,the involvement of Australian troops. We,32
NA,hope that if Namibia proves to be successful,32
NA,it may help wean the South African Govern-,32
NA,ment away from the policies of apartheid,32
NA,which are so universally condemned. It is in,32
NA,the interests of all South Africans that that,32
NA,tragedy be put to one side. But it is in our,32
NA,general interests to look to African affairs as,33
NA,we look to the affairs of any other part of,33
NA,"the world and to apply a measured, balanced",33
NA,and objective judgment on events.,33

NA,NA,33
NA,nite matter of public importance,33
NA,"to the House for discussion, namely:",33
NA,The impact of six years of economic mismanage-,33
NA,ment under the Hawke Government on the living,33
NA,standards of low to middle income earners.,33
NA,I call upon those members who approve of,33
NA,the proposed discussion to rise in their places.,33
NA,More than the number of members,33
NA,quired by the Standing Orders having risen,33
NA,in their places-,33
NA,NA,33
NA,is an interesting matter of public importance,33
NA,that I bring before the House today-even,33
NA,I say so myself-not only because it provides,33
NA,one with the opportunity to range over,33
NA,consequences of the economic mismanagestart,33
NA,ment of the Hawke Labor Government but,33
NA,"also because it provides an opportunity,",33
NA,"it not, for the Treasurer ( Mr Keating)",33
NA,"whoever else may respond, to pick up the",33
NA,"much vaunted, in recent days, publicity",33
NA,advertising campaign projected forward by,33
NA,the Government. The Government has told,33
NA,the Australian people that it is going to,33
NA,a comparison of its seven years in governber,33
NA,"ment, that is seven years of the Hawke Gov-",33
NA,ernment-it has had only six so far and the,33
NA,way it calls early elections it probably will,33
NA,not make seven-with the record of the,33
NA,"Fraser Government. I find that fascinating,",33
NA,quite apart from the reality that Australians,33
NA,"are suffering under record high interest rates,",33
NA,"a huge foreign debt, higher rates of inflation",33
NA,and hopeless positions for so many on,33
NA,housing.,33
NA,If the Government pauses at the com-,33
NA,"mencement of this comparison and says,",33
NA,"'Let's have a comparison', it is so retrospec-",33
NA,tive and rear vision mirror driven to be going,33
NA,"TRADE to the people and saying, 'Look at the past",33
NA,instead of looking to the future'. If we do a,33
NA,there were 7t years of the Fraser.,33
NA,apGovernment and six years of the Hawke,33
NA,Government which takes us back 13t years.,33
NA,It takes us back to the commencement of,33
NA,the Fraser Government which was the end,33
NA,of the Whitlam Government. If we wanted,33
NA,to go back ourselves what a time we would,33
NA,have comparing the record of Labor under,33
NA,Whitlam with the record for this nation un-,33
NA,Fraser. I will put that to one side and,33
NA,to examine the record of the last six,33
NA,We have the implied contrast that it,33
NA,going to make so explicit with the record,33
NA,be submitted of the Fraser Government.,33
NA,I pause before going on to say that on this,33
NA,side of politics we have formulated pro-,33
NA,"grams, schedules and policies that not only",33
NA,call forth the aspirations of Australians now,33
NA,but are predicated on the sort of Australia,33
NA,we want for the future. We look towards the,33
NA,"reyear 2000, which is only lOt years off,",33
NA,whereas the Government comes in with some,33
NA,. propaganda exercise going back 13t years.,33
NA,"Even the cognisance that the year 2000,",33
NA,which is a shorter comparative period of,33
NA,"if time than it wants to make, will be not only",33
NA,just to capture the sort of thing we are on,33
NA,"the about, for not only is I January 2000 the",33
NA,of a new year but it is the start of a,33
NA,"new century, and indeed the start of a new",33
NA,does millenium. It drives home the need to have,33
NA,or in mind the sort of Australia we want. But,33
NA,"no, the grubby little exercises, which the",33
NA,and Government thinks will bring it some frui-,33
NA,"tion, are to go back. The issues that strike",33
NA,at Australians today that have been caused,33
NA,do by this Government-I can think of a num-,33
NA,"of them-include tax, interest rates, for-",33
NA,"eign debt, unemployment, public housing",34
NA,listings and household disposable income. The,34
NA,question for the immediate future is: What,34
NA,is the Government's fiscal policy? The,34
NA,"Treasurer will come in here and say, 'Where",34
NA,is your policy here and where is your policy,34
NA,there?'. What is the Government's fiscal pol-,34
NA,icy for 1989-90? What is the Government's,34
NA,tax gross domestic product ratio going to be?,34
NA,What is the Government's target Budget sur-,34
NA,plus? What is the Government's target for,34
NA,the net public sector borrowing requirement?,34
NA,How will the Government finance the tax,34
NA,cuts and spending commitments or inflation?,34
NA,"By the way, quite apart from the Treasurer",34
NA,revealing himself today as a textual deviate,34
NA,"in misinterpreting my transcript, I also asked",34
NA,him a question about the projected rate of,34
NA,"inflation. He got up and said: 'Oh come on,",34
NA,I'm not going to answer that. It's all up here;,34
NA,I know it all. I gave all that out a couple of,34
NA,weeks ago at a press conference'-he has to,34
NA,do all these press conferences-'I went along,34
NA,to a press conference and I gave the answer,34
NA,to the press. Go and look it up'. So I went,34
NA,along and had a look at it. He was asked:,34
NA,So as of now there is no forecast for inflation?,34
NA,This was the answer:,34
NA,No. But you are not entitled to get off the top of,34
NA,my head CPI forecast.,34
NA,What a terrific answer! Some answer. The,34
NA,harsh reality is that there is no forecast for,34
NA,the projected rate of inflation. The Treasurer,34
NA,knows that. He could not give it at the press,34
NA,conference and he could not give it today.,34
NA,"We come to this comparative exercise, and I",34
NA,will go through a few of the examples. Those,34
NA,opposite are going to do the old seven-seven,34
NA,calculation-Fraser and Hawke. Let us have,34
NA,a look at tax. Starting point: this Treasurer,34
NA,is the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's,34
NA,"history. Bracket creep, tax creep, has taken",34
NA,a huge toll on Australian living standards.,34
NA,"Let us have a look at them. In 1982-83, 24.7",34
NA,per cent of Australians faced a marginal tax,34
NA,rate of 40 per cent or more. Today that,34
NA,figure is 51.3 per cent. Some contrast. Do,34
NA,not tell it to the marines if the Government,34
NA,thinks it is going to sell this successfully. We,34
NA,know interest rates are at a record high.,34
NA,Under the Labor Government average an-,34
NA,nual interest rates are significantly higher,34
NA,than under the Fraser Government. I· make,34
NA,the comparison here: average home loan re-,34
NA,payments as a share of household income,34
NA,have increased from 19 per cent in 1983 to,34
NA,almost 31 per cent. Some contrast. Because,34
NA,of the brevity of this debate I will not go,34
NA,"into detail on foreign debt but, as I have",34
NA,"consistently said, under Labor our net for-",34
NA,eign debt has virtually quadrupled.,34
NA,Let us consider public housing. We know,34
NA,what has happened in the private arena. For,34
NA,those who have been forced to look to public,34
NA,"housing, under Labor the number of people",34
NA,on public housing waiting lists has increased,34
NA,"from 110,000 to 160,000. Some contrast. The",34
NA,Treasurer is always talking about employ-,34
NA,ment records. Let us look at unemployment.,34
NA,Under Labor the average monthly unem-,34
NA,ployment rate has increased from 6.1 per,34
NA,cent under the Fraser Government to 8.5,34
NA,per cent under the Hawke Government. Un-,34
NA,der this Treasurer the number of long term,34
NA,unemployed has increased by nearly 20 per,34
NA,cent and under Labor the average youth,34
NA,unemployment rate has increased signifi-,34
NA,cantly. The House will remember that tragic,34
NA,report which came out the week before last,34
NA,from the Human Rights and Equal Oppor-,34
NA,"tunity Commission, the Burdekin report on",34
NA,youth homelessness. It had as a central ele-,34
NA,ment the linkage of homelessness and un-,34
NA,employment. Under six years of this Labor,34
NA,"Government, as all members of this House",34
NA,"know, Australian families on low to middle",34
NA,income earnings have had their living stand-,34
NA,ards slashed.,34
NA,"While I am on the subject of comparisons,",34
NA,a year ago the Labor Party had great cele-,34
NA,brations on the fifth anniversary of its elec-,34
NA,tion to power. It was the sixth anniversary,34
NA,yesterday. The Prime Minister was asked to,34
NA,go to the National Press Club and celebrate,34
NA,"the occasion, mark the occasion. He refused.",34
NA,The Prime Minister was asked to participate,34
NA,in a variety of functions yesterday. He could,34
NA,not because he had a previous engagement.,34
NA,He had to go to the track. He was at the,34
NA,race track. At least it was a change that he,34
NA,was gambling with his own money-I trust-,34
NA,rather than the money of most Australians.,34
NA,Government members crept through this cel-,34
NA,ebratory exercise almost as if they were going,34
NA,through the ventilators and under the carpet,34
NA,to avoid being seen yesterday.,34
NA,So much for the comparisons between the,34
NA,Hawke Government and the Fraser Govern-,34
NA,ment. What about this essential element of,35
NA,household disposable income? I really do,35
NA,think that the most damning indictment of,35
NA,this Government's economic management is,35
NA,just that-that while families on low to mid-,35
NA,dle incomes have suffered drastic declines in,35
NA,"their real incomes, those on higher incomes",35
NA,have emerged relatively unscathed. We have,35
NA,heard it in here before: a family on average,35
NA,weekly earnings--,35
NA,Mr Downer-Not Bondie?,35
NA,NA,35
NA,like that in a moment. Before we get to him,35
NA,because he earns a little more than a person,35
NA,"on average weekly earnings, a family on av-",35
NA,erage weekly earnings with a dependent,35
NA,spouse and two children would need $58 a,35
NA,week to return it to the position of disposa-,35
NA,ble income that it had at the time of the,35
NA,election of this Government. Some contrast,35
NA,again. When I confront the Treasurer with,35
NA,these figures he comes in time and again-,35
NA,he will probably refer to it again today-and,35
NA,"says, 'Well, it is no good referring to these",35
NA,people on average weekly earnings'. He does,35
NA,not see them. The old black windows in the,35
NA,car will not allow him to look at them.,35
Mr KEATING ,There are a lot in Toorak.,35
NA,NA,35
NA,"torate, so go and find out the facts. The",35
NA,Treasurer is getting it wrong again.,35
Mr HOWARD ,He needs a Gregory's to get,35
NA,to his electorate.,35
NA,Mr Carlton-He does not know where,35
NA,Bankstown is.,35
NA,NA,35
NA,"Liverpool preselection is being looked into,",35
NA,it seems to tie in fairly and squarely with,35
NA,the Treasurer's a few years ago. I can see,35
NA,that he will not be saying too much about,35
NA,the preselection techniques going on down,35
NA,"there, with the old left and right.",35
NA,The Treasurer comes in here and talks,35
NA,about the aggregate measure of per capita,35
NA,"real household disposable income, claiming",35
NA,that this has increased under the Labor Gov-,35
NA,ernment. It is true. The Treasurer has ac-,35
NA,tually come in a number of times and told,35
NA,us something that squares with the facts-,35
NA,that the aggregate measure of per capita real,35
NA,household disposable income has increased.,35
NA,"But, as with so many things, it begs the",35
NA,question of why.,35
NA,I listened to him one day and heard him,35
NA,say that. I went back and had a look at the,35
NA,"figures. I thought, 'He is right in this regard",35
NA,today. I had better look and see why these,35
NA,aggregates are so'. Do honourable members,35
NA,know what the answer is? The increase. in,35
NA,aggregate real per capita household dispos-,35
NA,able income is overwhelmingly due to in-,35
NA,creases in capital sourced incomes. If one,35
NA,"looks at the contribution of wages, salaries",35
NA,"and supplements to the growth, it is lower",35
NA,in the years of the Hawke Government than,35
NA,under the Fraser Government. Some con-,35
NA,trast. If one looks at the contribution of,35
NA,pensions and the like through personal ben-,35
NA,efit payments to the growth in real per cap-,35
NA,"ita disposable income, it is also lower in the",35
NA,years of the Hawke Government than under,35
NA,"the Fraser Government, but the contribution",35
NA,of capital sourced incomes to the growth in,35
NA,real per capita household income is signifi-,35
NA,"cantly higher. Of course, that includes the",35
NA,"mates, the rich mates.",35
NA,I do not know why he comes in and gives,35
NA,us this figure. The latest Australian Bureau,35
NA,of Statistics income distribution data tell a,35
NA,similar story: those on low to middle incomes,35
NA,have suffered while those on high incomes,35
NA,have done better. We have to move away,35
NA,"from the digits and the big picture, the big",35
NA,"canvas, the effervescence, the bubbles burst-",35
NA,"ing and the glass running over, and look at",35
NA,what he says when he is asked what he is,35
NA,"doing for the average person, which com-",35
NA,prises the majority of Australians today. Alan,35
NA,Ramsey on Four Corners asked him a very,35
NA,interesting question. He referred to the,35
NA,Treasurer's explanation for our bad balance,35
NA,of payments figures being that there had,35
NA,been a massive injection of additional na-,35
NA,tional income. I think the Treasurer said the,35
NA,economy had been too successful. It was too,35
NA,hard to handle all the success. Mr Ramsey,35
NA,said:,35
NA,Now a lot of people out there in the community,35
NA,"don't believe that you've been too successful, that",35
NA,they've got a lot of additional income in their pock-,35
NA,ets. Who got all the extra money and when are,35
NA,"ordinary people, your ordinary voters, your support-",35
NA,ers feel they are going to get their share of that,35
NA,money?,35
NA,The Treasurer went on again with the big,36
NA,"picture, big canvas, the effervescence. There",36
NA,was no answer because it could not be anit,36
NA,swered. The harsh reality is that this Treasthe,36
NA,urer is quite unable to state a case if,36
NA,wants to follow the propagandising of,36
NA,Prime Minister in comparative terms bechange,36
NA,tween the record of the Hawke Government,36
NA,and the Fraser Government because the,36
NA,comparison is odious. If I was speaking,36
NA,"yond the Treasury area, if I was moving",36
NA,beyond the subject of the matter of public,36
NA,"importance, it would not matter if it was",36
NA,"foreign affairs or, dare I mention",36
NA,"tion or, dare I mention it, living standards,",36
NA,the record of the Treasurer just does not,36
NA,"compare. At root, what has transpired under",36
NA,this Government is that life has been for the,36
NA,few-and the very few. I mentioned last,36
NA,week that I was quite struck when a promisame courtesy.,36
NA,nent official of the Labor Party in Victoria,36
NA,"said to me, when I challenged him about the there.",36
NA,"record of the Hawke Government, that it is",36
NA,'a government that we will not remember,36
NA,"with pride'-that is 'we', the Labor voters.",36
NA,It is not only the Labor voters who will not,36
NA,remember it with pride but also the members,36
NA,of the Australian community who have had,36
NA,to suffer and whose living standards have,36
NA,been reduced. They get nothing from this,36
NA,Treasurer but expectations that things will,36
NA,get better. The reality is that there has been,36
NA,a harshness and an irrelevance in the Treasof,36
NA,urer's policies in terms of the improvements,36
NA,in the living standards of Australians.,36
NA,Whether the Government goes straight to,36
NA,the election on its record or whether it seeks,36
NA,to make the comparison between the Fraser,36
NA,"years and the Hawke years, it will be conpolicy",36
NA,"demned because the comparison is crippling,",36
NA,and crippling for the Government.,36

NA,week under pressure to perform--,36
NA,NA,36
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MiIis dreadful,36
NA,dren)-Order! The Deputy Leader of the,36
NA,Opposition was heard in relative silence.,36
Mr KEATING,At the start of today's,36
NA,debate in the House I raised matters which,36
NA,"the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader",36
NA,"the Opposition, had said in an article headed",36
NA,'Peacock: The pressure's on to perform.'. Is,36
NA,not interesting to note that one week into,36
NA,"parliamentary session, despite all this",36
NA,he bluster and bravado about how the Govern-,36
NA,the ment was going to be under pressure to,36
NA,policy and how there was going to,36
NA,"be a big attack, there was only one group",36
NA,under attack and that was the Opposition.,36
NA,"beAt the beginning of the second week, here",36
NA,we are with an article entitled 'Peacock: The,36
NA,pressure's on to perform'. I suppose that he,36
NA,on will say that that story in a newspaper is a,36
NA,"it, immigrapiece of fiction.",36
NA,Opposition members-Look behind you!,36
Mr KEATING,The Deputy Leader of,36
NA,the Opposition was heard in silence; honour-,36
NA,able members opposite should show me the,36
NA,Mr Downer-All your supporters are,36
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I· do,36
NA,not require the assistance of the honourable,36
NA,member for Mayo. There is a great deal of,36
NA,interjection. If honourable members wish to,36
NA,draw themselves to the attention of the Chair,36
NA,"they should at least sit in their own seats,",36
NA,otherwise I expect them to remain silent.,36
Mr KEATING,We heard a speech full,36
NA,"of bluster, displaying all the political antics",36
NA,somebody who does not know what policy,36
NA,is about or what the issues are about. Today,36
NA,we were seeing someone using all the thes-,36
NA,pian skills he could muster to smother the,36
NA,fact that he put his policy foot in it. He,36
NA,committed the Opposition to the same public,36
NA,on budgetary matters as the Govern-,36
NA,ment. What we saw today was what we have,36
NA,often seen from the Deputy Leader of the,36
NA,"Opposition; that is, all tip and no iceberg. In",36
NA,"words, it was all bluster and blarney",36
NA,there was no quality or analysis under-,36
NA,it. In the course of his remarks he said,36
NA,that I was-to use his foolish expression-'a,36
NA,"textual deviate'. In other words, I dared to",36
NA,have the temerity to actually refer to some-,36
NA,"thing he had said in a text. Oh, shocking! It",36
NA,that the Treasurer should actually,36
NA,pick the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,36
NA,up on something! What did he say? In the,36
NA,principal conceptual debate last week about,36
NA,the current account and savings and public,36
NA,"of sector dissaving, he said we should have a",36
NA,"tightening of fiscal policy. Today, he was",37
NA,asked the following question:,37
NA,With the surplus would you still aim to have a,37
NA,"sufficient surplus to produce a net, a zero net",37
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition,37
NA,answered:,37
NA,That would be our aim .,37
NA,He then put out a press statement and got,37
NA,"up after Question Time to explain himself,",37
NA,in what was a pathetic apologia for a mis-,37
NA,"take, saying:",37
NA,. . . we will be in a better position because we,37
NA,are addressing public expenditure.,37
NA,"In other words, it does not matter which",37
NA,way one approaches it-whether one wishes,37
NA,to change the outlays or the receipts-he is,37
NA,in there supporting the same bottom line.,37
NA,His aim is to have exactly the same Budget,37
NA,"balance as that of the government; that is, a",37
NA,zero public sector borrowing requirement,37
NA,(PSBR). The Deputy Leader of the Opposi-,37
NA,tion has been saying that the Opposition,37
NA,stands apart from the Government because,37
NA,the Opposition has a different policy position,37
NA,on the principal issue in Australian public,37
NA,"life at the moment; that is, the current ac-",37
NA,count deficit and its solutions. On the prin-,37
NA,cipal issue-not a peripheral issue-in,37
NA,Australian politics and our economic life at,37
NA,the moment of the current account deficit,37
NA,and how the policy setting should be ad-,37
NA,justed to cope with it the shadow Treasurer,37
NA,says that the Opposition's fiscal policy will,37
NA,be the same as the Government's.,37
NA,NA,37
Mr KEATING,"No, the honourable",37
NA,member did worse than that. He then said,37
NA,he did not say it.,37
NA,NA,37
NA,amnesia.,37
Mr KEATING,We have the embar-,37
NA,"rassed silly giggle. Well, you should be em-",37
NA,barrassed. I saw you trying to explain to the,37
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) at,37
NA,Question Time about what you said. The,37
NA,Leader of the Opposition gave you no suc-,37
NA,cour and comfort in reply because he knows,37
NA,that you do not know.,37
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MiI-,37
NA,dren)-Order! I ask the Treasurer to direct,37
NA,his remarks through the Chair and then we,37
NA,might have some silence.,37
Mr KEATING,In a critical issue for the,37
NA,"public sector of Australia, particularly the",37
NA,"fiscal policy of the Commonwealth, the Op-",37
NA,"PSBR? position is saying, 'We'll have the same pol-",37
NA,icy as the Government; the same policy as,37
NA,you'. It is then suggesting to the people that,37
NA,it could carry out our policy better than we,37
NA,"have. If that is its position, that is fine; but",37
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put,37
NA,out a pathetic press statement an hour or so,37
NA,"ago, after Question Time, and this is the",37
NA,sentence which he says neutralises what he,37
NA,"said earlier; that' is, that a zero net PSBR",37
NA,would be his aim:,37
NA,"I mean, just take into account the figures I've given",37
NA,"you, puts them in a position where their aim---",37
NA,God knows what that means-,37
NA,that Keating constantly talks about and practice can,37
NA,point to will be destroyed and we will be in a better,37
NA,position because we are addressing public expenditure.,37
NA,"For a start, it is illiterate.",37
NA,NA,37
Mr KEATING,"Apart from that fact, it",37
NA,does not detract from the point his aim,37
NA,"would be a zero net PSBR. In other words,",37
NA,he commits his Party to the same fiscal pol-,37
NA,icy as that of the Government.,37
NA,NA,37
NA,ate Treasurer there has ever been.,37
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,37
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease,37
NA,interjecting.,37
Mr KEATING,I know that the honour-,37
NA,able member is embarrassed. Well he might,37
NA,be. His colleagues behind him and the Press,37
NA,Gallery know that in the interview today,37
NA,with Hadler he committed the Opposition to,37
NA,the Government's budgetary policy. His mate,37
NA,the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr,37
NA,Hewson) is waiting to get his job. He would,37
NA,"have another nail in the wall, and the Dep-",37
NA,uty Leader of the Opposition is in there,37
NA,talking about unemployment benefit and the,37
NA,rest. The fact is that he does not understand,37
NA,the policy brief. If he does not have a note,37
NA,under his nose he does not know. He does,37
NA,not do press conferences because he cannot,37
NA,cope with them. He does doorstops on one,37
NA,question and then runs away. He is not ac-,37
NA,countable. He always happens to be out of,37
NA,Canberra whenever there is a big news day,37
NA,on the economy so that he does not have to,37
NA,do a press conference.,37
NA,NA,38
NA,ences all the time.,38
Mr KEATING,Go and do one this week;,38
NA,face the Canberra Press Gallery tomorrow,38
NA,and let them ask about fiscal policy and the,38
NA,Budget balance. The Government was to,38
NA,come back under a cloud and under attack.,38
NA,'The Opposition is going to come in with a,38
NA,new policy prescription and tighten up ex-,38
NA,"penditure', said the Leader of the Opposi-",38
NA,tion. What do we have a week later? It is,38
NA,not the Government under pressure; the,38
NA,honourable· member for Kooyong is under,38
NA,pressure. He is not only under pressure today,38
NA,but also will be under pressure tomorrow by,38
NA,putting his great big foot in a place where,38
NA,he should not. Fancy not knowing the Op-,38
NA,"position's basic stance on fiscal policy! Fancy,",38
NA,"in his own mind, not knowing! In parliamen-",38
NA,tary terms the incompetence of not knowing,38
NA,"where fiscal policy is, is unspeakable. He",38
NA,knew that he had a matter of public impor-,38
NA,tance (MPI) on. I will bet he nearly died,38
NA,when he realised that he had put his foot in,38
NA,it and then had an MPI on.,38
NA,Mr Downer-He has got a fixation with,38
NA,the shadow Treasurer.,38
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,I warn the,38
NA,honourable member for Mayo.,38
Mr KEATING,So what happens? The,38
NA,boys behind him have closed ranks. They,38
NA,will let him get away with a silly speech,38
NA,about the Labor Party's record over six years,38
NA,"instead of defending his blunder, which is to",38
NA,commit his Party to the Government's pol-,38
NA,icy. After six years that is where honourable,38
NA,members opposite stand. They talk about,38
NA,their record. For 30 years they let Mc-,38
NA,Ewenism and protectionism poison this econ-,38
NA,"omy. For 30 years, through public policy",38
NA,"indolence, you let our manufacturing sector",38
NA,"run into the ground. In 1980-81, three years",38
NA,"before this Government came into office, the",38
NA,current account deficit was already at 6 per,38
NA,cent of gross domestic product. Those in the,38
NA,foreign affairs portfolio and in labour and,38
NA,domestic portfolios sat there doing nothing,38
NA,"about this problem, and then this Govern-",38
NA,ment got the job of trying to haul Australia,38
NA,back into the twentieth century from the,38
NA,late nineteenth century to make the place,38
NA,look like a modern industrial state-and,38
NA,members of the Opposition are here saying,38
NA,'Look at the average'. The most dishonest,38
NA,statistic that the Opposition uses today is the,38
NA,average of unemployment under the former,38
NA,Fraser Government and under this Govern-,38
NA,ment: the average using the low number that,38
NA,the Opposition inherited from the Whitlam,38
NA,years was the high number that was left this,38
NA,Government. Fancy anyone daring to use,38
NA,that.,38
NA,This has all been trotted out today because,38
NA,the honourable member had to fill in a 15-,38
NA,minute speech when he knew that basically,38
NA,he had muffed it and put his foot in it on,38
NA,the basic strategy point. There is the approv-,38
NA,ing giggle from the Leader of the Opposition,38
NA,"( Mr Howard), who would be ready to shaft",38
NA,"the honourable member at a minute's notice,",38
NA,"particularly for this performance, and from",38
NA,the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr,38
NA,"Hewson), who cannot wait to get the shadow",38
NA,"Treasurer's job, and from the rest of the",38
NA,"ineffective shadow front bench, who would",38
NA,"not know what fiscal policy, the non-farm",38
NA,"deflator or anything else meant. Basically,",38
NA,they are a bunch of gargoyles sitting there,38
NA,"listening to the debate, like watching a tennis",38
NA,match with the ball going backwards and,38
NA,forwards. That is the context in which the,38
NA,honourable member for Kooyong is here to-,38
NA,"day, and I know it.",38
NA,I do not mind and have never minded,38
NA,being accountable for this Government's pol-,38
NA,icies at any number of press conferences-,38
NA,"good or bad news-but I do mind, frankly,",38
NA,when the Opposition will not be held ac-,38
NA,countable. When the Deputy Leader of the,38
NA,Opposition makes a mistake like this and,38
NA,"unambiguously says, 'That would be our",38
NA,"aim'-that is, to adopt the Government's",38
NA,"fiscal policy, which is. the primary instrument",38
NA,of economic policy-in these circumstances,38
NA,of pulling down public sector demands on,38
NA,"Australian savings, and then uses this gobble-",38
NA,degook in the paragraph that I read earlier,38
NA,"to worm his way out of what is a major,",38
NA,"cardinal political and economic error, this is",38
NA,a gaffe of unbelievable proportions the like,38
NA,of which I have never seen.,38
NA,The honourable member talks about the,38
NA,Labor Party's record. The only record that,38
NA,the Opposition has to worry about is our,38
NA,electoral record. I know the Opposition was,38
NA,full of bravado about how it would beat us,38
NA,in 1984 and then did not. Then Mr Howard,38
NA,said from the -omfort of so-e New Yor-,39
NA,-otel that the times would SUIt th.e. 0PPOSI_,39
NA,"tIon for 1987, and the OpposItIon was",39
NA,creamed again. The Opposition will get,39
NA,"creamed another time because, basically, out",39
NA,"there in the business community, amongst",39
NA,"the elite of this country, ordinary working",39
NA,"people, people know that the Opposition is",39
NA,a joke. The people who write newspaper,39
NA,leaders and run the debate know that the,39
NA,Opposition could not cut the mustard in,39
NA,"fit. One week back, when the Government",39
NA,is supposed to be under enormous economic,39
NA,"and political pressure, all today will prove",39
NA,that the person under pressure is the Deputy,39
NA,Leader of the Opposition on the basis of,39
NA,massive and gross incompetence.,39
NA,..A- far as. t-e record goes and all these,39
NA,IdIOtIC. and lI-smcere references to,39
NA,what IS the VIew from the champagne sUIte,39
NA,on Melbourne Cup day of the battlers with,39
NA,the old top hat and tails on and the chamimportant,39
NA,pagne bottle in their hand? When did the,39
NA,Opposition ever worry about battlers?,39
NA,the Opposition ever worry about them when,39
NA,"it was in government, when those unemployrating",39
NA,ment numbers were rolling up under the,39
NA,honourable .members for Kooyong and to,39
NA,Bennelong? Fancy the Deputy Leader of the,39
NA,"Opposition having the hide, representing one",39
NA,of the toffee seats of Melbourne and perpetthe,39
NA,"ually mixing with that clique, to talk about",39
NA,battlers. It would make a cat laugh. Then,39
NA,is supposed to come in here crying crocodile,39
NA,tears about unemployment and the social,39
NA,wage. The Opposition would rip Australia,39
NA,pieces. It would have interest rates at 30,39
NA,cent. It has no wages policy. It has adopted,39
NA,our fiscal policy. This would leave it with,39
NA,"one instrument left, which is monetary polto",39
NA,icy. The Opposition would tear the place to forward.,39
NA,pieces like it did in the past. But it will not,39
NA,be given the opportunity.,39
NA,"All today reveals is that six years on,",39
NA,"yesterday, the Opposition has not moved",39
NA,centimetre in terms of understanding policy,39
NA,or the framework. That means that the Op1982-83,39
NA,position is as empty-headed and useless tois,39
NA,day as it was six years ago. That is the,39
NA,"message for the public and the press gallery,",39
NA,and that is the message that will clearly seep,39
NA,through to the Australian electorate before,39
NA,polling day. That is why the Opposition will,39
NA,"go to where it belongs, which is another rise.",39
NA,"thr-e years o- the green leather opposite,",39
NA,"asking us questIOns, putting out mindless press",39
NA,statements and generally acting the fool.,39
Mr BRAITHWAITE,ITE (Dawson) (4.25)-,39
NA,It must be a surpnse to the members of the,39
NA,Gover-ment who. have been challenged to,39
NA,com- 10 here to !Isten to the Treasurer ( Mr,39
NA,Ke-tmg) to reahse that t-ey are going out,39
NA,as Ignorant as they came m. There has not,39
NA,a been one remark in the last 15 minutes ad-,39
NA,dressed to the matter of public importance.,39
NA,The Treasurer's spee-h lacked substance and,39
NA,is had a lot of rh-tonc: One always knows,39
NA,when a salesman IS selhng a ba- produ-t. He,39
NA,does not try to .uphold the quahty of hIS own,39
NA,produ--; he tnes to chall-nge. that of .the,39
NA,oPPosItIon. The Treasurer 10 thIS regard IS a,39
NA,bad salesman and even did a bad job trying,39
NA,"battle!s, to challenge the Opposition.",39
NA,',39
NA,What we are talking about today is a very,39
NA,part of the constituency who have,39
NA,been overlooked completely by this Labor,39
NA,Did Government-the lower and middle income,39
NA,"earners, whose living standards are deterio-",39
NA,because of the lack of real disposable,39
NA,income. When the services that are available,39
NA,people from a disposable income are com-,39
NA,"pared-housing, health, education for the",39
NA,"family, recreation and just everyday living-",39
NA,facts and figures of the last six years,39
NA,indicate that there is no way in the world,39
NA,he that th- lower and middle income earners,39
NA,are any better off in terms of their disposable,39
NA,incomes than they were six years ago. It does,39
NA,to not matter what record one takes. No won-,39
NA,per der the Treasurer devoted all that time to,39
NA,talking about the Opposition and the shadow,39
NA,NA,39
NA,grips with the argument that we have put,39
NA,Let us consider past rec;ords and foreign,39
NA,debt. Everybody will be well aware that the,39
NA,to increase in foreign debt has been massive,39
NA,"a under this Government. For example, for-",39
NA,eign debt has increased from $36 billion in,39
NA,"to $121 billion last September, which",39
NA,greater than a three-fold increase. The net,39
NA,foreign debt for 1982-83 was $22' billion. It,39
NA,is now $97 billion-nearly 4! times as much.,39
NA,"It is only held at that figure beca,use of a",39
NA,"high exchange rate, and when the exchange",39
NA,rate starts plummeting' again that figure will,39
NA,Let us consider the record in relation to,40
NA,"inflation rates. Our inflation rate, which came",40
NA,as a rather savage surprise to the Treasurer,40
NA,"just recently, in comparison with the rest of",40
NA,the world leaves Australian citizens in a very,40
NA,"bad situation. For instance, in 1984 the infla-",40
NA,tion rate in Australia was 3.9 per cent com-,40
NA,pared to the 5.2 per cent average of the,40
NA,Organisation for Economic Cooperation and,40
NA,Development (OECD) and the 6.7 per cent,40
NA,average in the European Economic Com-,40
NA,munity (EEC). Looking at the same situa-,40
NA,"tion today, the inflation rate faced by our",40
NA,citizens is 7.7 per cent compared with the,40
NA,OECD rate of 4.3 per cent and the EEC,40
NA,rate of 3.9. That is the figure that the Treas-,40
NA,urer challenges as being incorrect. I would,40
NA,suggest that there are a lot of battling fami-,40
NA,"lies who would say that, indeed, the con-",40
NA,sumer price index (CPI) is incorrect and,40
NA,"that, with the pressures they face in everyday",40
NA,"life, the CPI is undoubtedly higher than that",40
NA,recorded figure.,40
NA,It is very important to look at a compari-,40
NA,son of interest rates. Interest rates are an,40
NA,important factor when one looks at the,40
NA,standard of living that people enjoy. Too,40
NA,"many people in Australia today, particularly",40
NA,"the lower and middle income brackets, have",40
NA,to borrow to enjoy those standards that we,40
NA,are talking about. In 1983 the comparative,40
NA,interest rate in Australia was 13.7 per cent,40
NA,while in the USA it was 11.4 per cent. In,40
NA,Australia it is now 13.05 per cent and 9.1,40
NA,"per cent in the USA. In Japan, one of our",40
NA,"major competitors, it is 4.17 per cent. So on",40
NA,"an international comparison, I ask: Who is",40
NA,"the better off? In national comparisons, all",40
NA,Australians have been worse off in that,40
NA,period.,40
NA,Last week the Leader of the Opposition,40
NA,( Mr Howard) asked the Prime Minister ( Mr,40
NA,Hawke) about disposable income. The Prime,40
NA,Minister did not cite the source of his infor-,40
NA,"mation, but he said that this Government",40
NA,has increased real household disposable in-,40
NA,come by 5 per cent. He also mentioned that,40
NA,1t million people had gained employment.,40
NA,In fact the booklet put out by the Australian,40
NA,Institute of Family Studies on the income,40
NA,"transfer proje,ct, entitled Families and Tax",40
NA,"in 1989, released just last week, indicates:",40
NA,"The three components of prices, taxes and wages",40
NA,"are contained in the three words, real, disposable",40
NA,and income. 'Real' means adjusted for inflation; 'dis-,40
NA,posable income' means income after taxes have been,40
NA,"deducted and family allowances, pensions and bene-",40
NA,fits and supplements added in.,40
NA,I seek leave to table a document taken from,40
NA,the report which shows what the facts are,40
NA,and what the Prime Minister did not disclose,40
NA,the other day.,40
NA,Leave granted.,40
Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,The table indi-,40
NA,"cates that from 1976-77 to 1984-85 everyone,",40
NA,from single income people to couples and,40
NA,"sole parents, benefited by as little as $26.79",40
NA,a week to as much as $38.42 a week. Be-,40
NA,tween 1984-85 and 1988-89 a single person's,40
NA,disposable income dropped by $30.61; that,40
NA,of a couple with two children dropped by,40
NA,$4l.71; and that of a couple with four chil-,40
NA,dren dropped by $47.85. Where does the,40
NA,Prime Minister get his figure of a 5 per cent,40
NA,improvement in disposable income when,40
NA,these figures come from a quite neutral plan-,40
NA,"ning authority, the Institute of Family Stud-",40
NA,"ies? Its figures, which agree with ours, show",40
NA,quite conclusively that a family with two,40
NA,children has suffered a deterioration of $58,40
NA,a week. This fact was supported recently by,40
NA,"Eric Risstrom, who said that Australian fam-",40
NA,ilies in that category are $56 a week worse,40
NA,off now than they were those many years,40
NA,ago.,40
NA,I would now like to deal with what dis-,40
NA,posable income is supposed to buy in 1989.,40
NA,"Last week we had a major housing summit,",40
NA,which was a talkfest. The quality of housing,40
NA,is one of the things by which we measure,40
NA,our standard of living. That meeting was,40
NA,really a diversion by the Treasurer and the,40
NA,Prime Minister so that we could not see the,40
NA,real situation in the housing industry today.,40
NA,"A report of only this morning, following a",40
NA,"poll by Saulwick, indicates that far from",40
NA,what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister,40
NA,are saying-that the problem is a shortage,40
NA,of land-only one person in 10 believes that,40
NA,but four out of 10 people believe the prob-,40
NA,lem can be blamed fairly and squarely on,40
NA,interest rates.,40
NA,Last Friday the Treasurer gave away land,40
NA,that I understand had already been under,40
NA,option to a Singaporean agency. Some other,40
NA,land is subject to flooding. So not only is he,40
NA,trying to push his economics uphill but also,40
NA,he will be pushing water uphill to prove that,40
NA,there is no flooding in that area. A third,41
NA,problem is that some of the land is used as,41
NA,"an airport, and that will always remain an",41
NA,airport. That is the Treasurer's response to,41
NA,"the major problems of housing in Australia,",41
NA,particularly for those low to middle income,41
NA,earners.,41
NA,In 1983 the average monthly repayment,41
NA,on a housing loan was $350. Today it is,41
NA,$778. In 1983 it was 19.2 per cent of a,41
NA,person's income and in September 1988 it,41
NA,was 30.7 per cent. There are record interest,41
NA,"rates now applying, particularly in the home",41
NA,loan area. In March 1983 the interest rate,41
NA,on home loans was 12.5 per cent and today,41
NA,it is 15.5 per cent. The prime rate of interest,41
NA,"has gone from 14 per cent to 17.5 per cent,",41
NA,and the small overdraft rate has gone from,41
NA,14 per cent to 17.5 per cent. The small,41
NA,overdraft rate is very important to those,41
NA,people trying to get a housing loan but not,41
NA,being able to get a deposit together.,41
NA,I heard as recently as today that the banks,41
NA,are asking those people to get a personal,41
NA,"loan, in addition to their mortgage, which",41
NA,carries an extra rate of interest of 2 per cent.,41
NA,If the Treasurer or the Prime Minister wanted,41
NA,"to get to the base of the problem, they would",41
NA,find that in the last six years people have,41
NA,had to walk out of their houses because of,41
NA,the increased loan repayments due to high,41
NA,interest rates. We cannot blame this on any-,41
NA,thing but the Treasurer's determination to,41
NA,make sure that interest rates remain high.,41
NA,He is not taking any interest in the living,41
NA,standards of the people we are concerned,41
NA,"for, the low and middle income earners. We",41
NA,are not talking about the Treasurer's living,41
NA,"standards, but those of people on low and",41
NA,middle incomes who have suffered from those,41
NA,"interest rates,. high taxation and now this",41
NA,latest scandal of the Treasurer not being,41
NA,prepared to support his own policies in this,41
NA,Government.,41
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr MiI-,41
NA,dren)-Order! The honourable member's time,41
NA,has expired.,41
Mr RONALD EDWARDS ,Stirling),41
NA,(4.35)-Today's matter of public importance,41
NA,from the Opposition challenges the Govern-,41
NA,ment to talk about the living standards of,41
NA,ordinary people. It also mentions economic,41
NA,management and how that economic man-,41
NA,agement affects living standards. The Oppo-,41
NA,sition has argued that there has been a decline,41
NA,in living standards under the Labor Govern-,41
NA,ment. At the outset we say that that is not,41
NA,"the case, and we can talk about statistics in",41
NA,a minute to show that. But what we also,41
NA,ought to say is that I and others on my side,41
NA,of the House are quite happy to oblige the,41
NA,Opposition with a debate about economic,41
NA,management. When we reflect back over the,41
NA,"seven sorry years that preceded us, we realise",41
NA,that there was a record of economic misman-,41
NA,agement. We have only to reflect back to,41
NA,the time when we took office in 1983 to see,41
NA,that high inflation was common in Aus-,41
NA,"tralia-for example, 11 per cent-coupled",41
NA,with what is really a very sorry record in,41
NA,"unemployment, which was rising. In fact we",41
NA,had a condition known as stagflation. People,41
NA,"such as the Minister at the table, the Minis-",41
NA,ter for Land Transport and Shipping Sup-,41
NA,"port ( Mr Robert Brown), are familiar with",41
NA,it. It takes an extraordinary economic inabil-,41
NA,ity to get into that combined condition of,41
NA,"high unemployment and high inflation, but",41
NA,the Opposition managed to do that. It even,41
NA,reinforced it by ensuring that in its last year,41
NA,in office it put an extra quarter of a million,41
NA,people on the unemployment list. That was,41
NA,an extraordinary achievement. In the context,41
NA,"of an expanding Budget deficit, in Keynesian",41
NA,"terms, it ought to have been soaking up",41
NA,unemployment-but it was not. So we had a,41
NA,prospective Budget deficit of $9.6 billion un-,41
NA,der the present Opposition-it was already,41
NA,running a high deficit anyway-and it was,41
NA,"not eating into unemployment, but those high",41
NA,rates of unemployment were not eating into,41
NA,inflation either. So. we had this paradoxical,41
NA,situation in terms of the tests of economic,41
NA,"management: high inflation, high unemploy-",41
NA,"ment and a high deficit. ,",41
NA,But the story went on. We thought that,41
NA,as they messed it up in terms of unemploy-,41
NA,"ment policy and fiscal policy, they might get",41
NA,it right in terms of monetary policy. But they,41
NA,"did not. Despite their best efforts, the infla-",41
NA,"tion rate and interest rates, which at one",41
NA,"stage reached 22 per cent, ran away from",41
NA,them. We have to remember that these were,41
NA,the four major achievements that they could,41
NA,go out on. As the lights went out on Mal-,41
NA,"colm Fraser and .John Howard, they also",41
NA,took out with them some extraordinary eco-,41
NA,"nomic statistics-high inflation, high unem-",42
NA,"ployment, a very high deficit and high interest",42
NA,rates. We might have thought that the tale,42
NA,"would have ended there, but it did not, be-",42
NA,cause they also took out with them high tax,42
NA,rates. They managed at the same time to,42
NA,leave in place the 60 per cent marginal tax,42
NA,rate. So one can count their five extraordi-,42
NA,nary achievements--,42
NA,Mr Robert Brown-And negative growth.,42
Mr RONALD EDWARDS,I was going,42
NA,to turn to negative economic growth. For,42
NA,the first time in 20 years we had negative,42
NA,economic growth. It was an extraordinary,42
NA,achievement. I find it unusual for the Op-,42
NA,"position to come in here on an anniversary,",42
NA,"if we can call it that, and say, 'Let us look",42
NA,back at what has been achieved'. We are,42
NA,"happy to do that, but when we do, the first",42
NA,thing we are forced to do is reflect upon the,42
NA,economic mismanagement that preceded us.,42
NA,We are happy to oblige the Opposition on,42
NA,"this, but it is fair to say that we should look",42
NA,at the tax policies and the policy options,42
NA,that have been explored by us and the,42
NA,Opposition.,42
NA,I said that the 60c in the dollar rate of,42
NA,tax was still in place when the Opposition,42
NA,"was in power, and we brought it down to",42
NA,49c. But we also did a number of other,42
NA,"things in terms of tax reform, most of which",42
NA,Opposition members did not like. They did,42
NA,not like them because they affected people,42
NA,"whom they were happy to protect, particu-",42
NA,larly those engaged in tax avoidance and,42
NA,"evasion practices. More than that, they were",42
NA,not happy to tackle the issue of the capital,42
NA,gains tax; they did not want to. They were,42
NA,also happy to keep the free lunches in place.,42
NA,I find it extraordinary that Opposition mem-,42
NA,bers have backed off addressing the many,42
NA,opportunities that we have put in front of,42
NA,the Australian public in the past six years.,42
NA,They are still the defenders of the free lunch.,42
NA,We have learnt in the last couple of days,42
NA,that they have finally managed to renege on,42
NA,the assets test in terms of a social welfare,42
NA,policy.,42
NA,I wish that at some stage members of the,42
NA,National Party of Australia would challenge,42
NA,members of the Liberal Party of Australia. I,42
NA,know the Nationals are challenging the Lib-,42
NA,erals on the Kerin wheat marketing plan.,42
NA,But the previous Government-and mem-,42
NA,bers of the Opposition should reflect upon,42
NA,this because it has had very serious long term,42
NA,implications-overvalued the Australian dol-,42
NA,lar over a long period and thereby gave no,42
NA,help to our export industries. It was the,42
NA,decision of this Government to float the,42
NA,Australian dollar that corrected those prob-,42
NA,lems. It is all very well for members of the,42
NA,Opposition to talk about market outcomes.,42
NA,But they were not willing to let market out-,42
NA,comes prevail. They wanted to disguise those,42
NA,outcomes with what amounted to a managed,42
NA,exchange rate. People in the export market,42
NA,will tell members of the Opposition that that,42
NA,is not the way to conduct an economy that,42
NA,is growing and vibrant. We have had to,42
NA,change one of those fundamentals and allow,42
NA,the Australian dollar to float. The previous,42
NA,Government never met that challenge. The,42
NA,Australian public knew that it would not,42
NA,meet that challenge. The interesting thing is,42
NA,that the Australian public know that the,42
NA,"Opposition, even though it has had six years",42
NA,"cooling down on the opposition benches, will",42
NA,still not meet the challenge. Opposition,42
NA,members still react to the sectional interest,42
NA,"groups, as they always have.",42
NA,I have found it very interesting-as I am,42
NA,sure my colleague the Minister for Land,42
NA,Transport and Shipping Support has-to,42
NA,watch Opposition members over the last six,42
NA,years. We realise that it is a bit difficult being,42
NA,in opposition because a lot of the time one,42
NA,"has to counterpunch, react to Government",42
NA,initiatives and try to put a reasonable posi-,42
NA,tive gloss on what otherwise is a difficult job.,42
NA,"We accept that, and the Australian public",42
NA,accepts that. But one would have thought,42
NA,"that, having done that counterpunching ex-",42
NA,"ercise, members of the Opposition would have",42
NA,"sat back and said, 'Let us put together a",42
NA,policy framework that is designed to project,42
NA,Australia into the future'. We thought that,42
NA,"the Opposition, after six years, would have",42
NA,produced such a framework. We thought,42
NA,that Future Directions would be it; but it is,42
NA,not. It is a look back into the past. No one,42
NA,"is rejecting the past; what we are asking is,",42
NA,'What is the promise for tomorrow? What,42
NA,chances and opportunities can you put in the,42
NA,way of the Australian public?'. The sad thing,42
NA,about Future Directions is that it does not,42
NA,do that. It is a 'look back over your shoulder',43
NA,approach.,43
NA,Some of us have been quiet over the past,43
NA,six years and have been willing to listen very,43
NA,carefully to try to see what policy prescrip-,43
NA,tions might be presented by the Opposition.,43
NA,But none have been presented. One can un-,43
NA,derstand that because being in opposition is,43
NA,often very difficult. But the other side of,43
NA,that is that the Opposition has not been,43
NA,prepared to do the hard work of putting the,43
NA,policies together. Where is the wages policy?,43
NA,Where is the industry policy? Where is the,43
NA,exchange rate policy? Where is the tax pol-,43
NA,icy? Where is the employment policy? They,43
NA,are important questions; 1 think they are fair,43
NA,questions. They certainly get asked in here,43
NA,and they are also asked in the community.,43
NA,The Opposition would do itself and those,43
NA,who seek to vote for it a lot of good if it,43
NA,had alternative policies that were thought,43
NA,through in terms of projections down the,43
NA,track. 1 accept that Opposition members want,43
NA,to look back to the past because the past,43
NA,was successful. But the problem is that it has,43
NA,not learnt enough from the past. All the,43
NA,Opposition has done is focus on knee-jerk,43
NA,prejudices that make it feel comfortable. But,43
NA,that approach does not equip it for dealing,43
NA,with what is down the track tomorrow. It is,43
NA,a bit like having a football team. The other,43
NA,"Minister at the table, the Minister for Trade",43
NA,"Negotiations ( Mr Duffy), knows that Essen-",43
NA,don has to recruit new players if it wants to,43
NA,be competitive. The problem is that those,43
NA,opposite have not followed that line. They,43
NA,have not recruited new players. They have,43
NA,"simply said, 'We have a couple of premier-",43
NA,ship trophies on the shelf from a few years,43
NA,back'. They may have the premiership tro-,43
NA,"phies from a few years back, but the public",43
NA,"is asking, 'What are you offering us this",43
NA,season? What is the new coaching strategy,43
NA,and who are the new players?'.,43
NA,"Sadly, 1 have to say that 1 never come",43
NA,here with any sense of excitement in that,43
NA,sense. 1 never wonder what the Opposition's,43
NA,policies will be because all we ever hear is,43
NA,the short term fix or a quick comment. Again;,43
NA,"to be fair, that is reasonable because there",43
NA,are people in the press gallery who want a,43
NA,daily feed. But. the larger Australian com-,43
NA,munity wants a more substantial meal. They,43
NA,want to know what is the Opposition's strat-,43
NA,egy. The Opposition has to address some,43
NA,taxing and very serious questions.,43
NA,We have a joint responsibility to inspire,43
NA,the Australian community with a belief that,43
NA,this country has policies and projections for,43
NA,the future. It is my view that the Govern-,43
NA,ment has done a lot of that work. We can,43
NA,talk about the public sector borrowing re-,43
NA,quirement and the reduction of a deficit into,43
NA,a surplus. We have done all those things and,43
NA,met those challenges. But the challenge is,43
NA,not over. We have to do a lot more on,43
NA,restructuring. We have to do a lot more for,43
NA,our export industries and import competing,43
NA,industries. Those challenges are still before,43
NA,us. We on this side of the House would be,43
NA,crazy to say that those challenges do not,43
NA,"exist; they do. But, in facing those chal-",43
NA,"lenges, one has to make sure that one has",43
NA,addressed the other things. We will not have,43
NA,the support of the Australian public if we,43
NA,"are not doing something about job creation,",43
NA,taxes and attitudes towards the training and,43
NA,education of young people. If we fail those,43
NA,"tests, the public will say, 'It is no good your",43
NA,going out into the wider world until you,43
NA,have met our requirements at home'. 1 say,43
NA,to those opposite that over the past six years,43
NA,that has been done. But there is a lot more,43
NA,"to be done. 1 am confident that, with the",43
NA,"policies we have put in place so far, we are",43
NA,in a position to do that. The Opposition,43
NA,faces the challenge of getting that hard work,43
NA,done. The evidence so far is that it has not,43
NA,done it. 1 am happy to reject the matter of,43
NA,public importance put forward by the,43
NA,Opposition.,43

NA,That the amendments be agreed to.,46
NA,There are three amendments: two amend-,46
NA,ments are in respect of clause 37 and the,46
NA,third is in respect of clause 46. I am advised,46
NA,"that, with respect to clause 37, specific cases",46
NA,the have arisen to which the attention of the,46
NA,Government has been drawn by way of,46
NA,this amendment in the other place. The Govern-,46
NA,not ment has no difficulty in accepting those two,46
NA,in the amendments. In respect of the amendment,46
NA,"to the to clause 46, I am advised that a possible",46
NA,the inunintended consequence will arise from the,46
NA,"that carriage of this amendment. However, it is",46
NA,the an amendment that has been imposed upon,46
NA,"to the the Government in the other place, and we",46
NA,for have no alternative but to accept it.,46
NA,NA,46
NA,NA,46
NA,NA,46
NA,"understand it, Senator Walsh indicated that",46
NA,called the amendment to clause 46 was not accept-,46
NA,has been able to the Government. I am pleased to,46
NA,hear that it is now acceptable. I say to the,46
NA,NA,46
NA,or held Morris) that we do not oppose the amend-,46
NA,ments that he has put to the Committee. We,46
NA,have pressed for the amendments in the Sen-,46
NA,"Comate, as the Minister either mentioned or im-",46
NA,a plied. The record of the Government in this,46
NA,"""fresh arena of taxation is not good. It has contin-",46
NA,land ually ridden roughshod over the taxpayer in,46
NA,an the pursuit of ever-increasing tax revenue.,46
NA,"Added to that, the legislation has often been",46
NA,"fresh needlessly complex and convoluted, thus",46
NA,to breaking one of the fundamental tenets of a,46
NA,"origgood taxation system, that is, the need for",46
NA,simplicity.,46
NA,"The amendments before the Committee,",46
NA,"the as I understand them, will at least bring back",46
NA,not be a little equity to the tax system. I had in-,46
NA,retended to refer to some of the details of the,46
NA,as a matters involved; I will not do so. I trust,46
NA,"the that the Government, from the words used",46
NA,"of the by the Minister, is picking up the amend-",46
NA,"ment to clause 46, which will add to existing",46
NA,the legislation affording automatic roll-over re-,46
NA,lief to asset transfers between spouses upon,46
NA,the breakdown of their marriage where the,47
NA,transfer is effected pursuant to an order of a,47
NA,court under the Family Law Act. The Aus-,47
NA,tralian Democrats and the Opposition have,47
NA,been arguing strongly for this amendment.,47
NA,"Senator Walsh, on behalf of the Govern-",47
NA,"ment, claimed that the new amendment",47
NA,would have an adverse retrospective effect,47
NA,"on some people, but he has produced noth-",47
NA,ing but esoteric examples to show this. He,47
NA,has not displayed a case in which some would,47
NA,"be hurt. Indeed, the Democrats' amendment",47
NA,was introduced on 8 November last year. If,47
NA,"it does have a vague retrospective impact, it",47
NA,"is incumbent on the Government, backed by",47
NA,"the vast resources of the bureaucracy, to re-",47
NA,word the clause.,47
NA,We are pleased to support the other,47
NA,amendments to clauses which have a retro-,47
NA,spective and other effect on capital gains. It,47
NA,is only because of the quick action of the,47
NA,Opposition in most of these amendments-I,47
NA,give the Democrats credit for the one which,47
NA,I mentioned in a little more detail-that the,47
NA,inequities will be forestalled. I note that not,47
NA,everyone is so lucky. A recent Administra-,47
NA,tive Appeals Tribunal case on the original,47
NA,"capital gains tax legislation, which is being",47
NA,amended by Taxation Laws Amendment Bill,47
NA,"(No.3), found a gross case of retrospectiv-",47
NA,"ity; that is, retrospectivity caused by Govern-",47
NA,"ment press release, about which I have talked",47
NA,in this Parliament on many occasions.,47
NA,Let me draw the Minister's attention to,47
NA,"case No. 4825, in which the taxpayers en-",47
NA,tered into a leasing arrangement with a pe-,47
NA,trol company on 13 March 1986. At that,47
NA,date the capital gains tax was operative fol-,47
NA,lowing the announcement of the Treasurer,47
NA,"( Mr Keating) on 19 September 1985, but",47
NA,the actual details of the imposition of capital,47
NA,"gains tax were unknown, and remained un-",47
NA,known until such time as the Bill was intro-,47
NA,duced into Parliament on 22 May. I do not,47
NA,want to take up the time of the Committee.,47
NA,Having drawn the Government's attention,47
NA,"to this matter, I ask it to look at it. Deputy",47
NA,"President Bannon, when delivering the rea-",47
NA,"sons for his decision, stated:",47
NA,The taxpayer and his wife appeared to me to be,47
NA,hard working Australian citizens who were in finan-,47
NA,cial difficulties . . . There is no element of tax,47
NA,"avoidance in this case, only conflict with the new",47
NA,law. It is with regret that I reach the conclusion ...,47
NA,I think that some injustice has been done.,47
NA,Later legislation has not mirrored what was,47
NA,"contained in the press release, causing, in the",47
NA,"words of the Deputy President, h-rdship.",47
NA,"There are sure to be other examples, but I",47
NA,think his words speak for themselves.,47
NA,I conclude by asking the Minister to con-,47
NA,vey to the Treasurer the request that he,47
NA,provide an undertaking that the appropriate,47
NA,legislation will be amended so that other,47
NA,taxpayers will not be similarly subject to the,47
NA,retrospective impact of the capital gains tax.,47
NA,I regard this Government as a rapacious,47
NA,government. It hounds people for tax at all,47
NA,"times. But generally, I think it would wish",47
NA,to do so only under the law. Where there,47
NA,"are circumstances of a conflict in the law,",47
NA,even this heartless Government ought to be,47
NA,moved to make amendments.,47
NA,NA,47
NA,ister for Industrial Relations) (5.05)-1 think,47
NA,it is the ultimate hypocrisy to hear the Dep-,47
NA,NA,47
NA,"speak about hounding people for tax. Yes,",47
NA,we hound tax cheats and the tax rogues that,47
NA,the Opposition fostered and promoted--,47
NA,"Mr Beale-Hey, come on!",47
NA,NA,47
NA,"record and read it, my friend. Yes, we are",47
NA,"hounding those tax cheats, but within the",47
NA,limits of the law so that they pay their fair,47
NA,share of what they are properly required to,47
NA,pay just as all other honest wage and salary,47
NA,earners pay their share. We know that the,47
NA,"policy of the Opposition, in government, was",47
NA,to foster the only growth industry it had-,47
NA,the growth of tax avoidance and tax evasion.,47
NA,I do not want to belabour the Deputy Leader,47
NA,of the Opposition any longer. The point made,47
NA,by Senator Walsh still stands. There may,47
NA,well be unintended consequences in respect,47
NA,of the amendment to clause 46-the moving,47
NA,"of the date back from 28 January 1988, in",47
NA,regard to the exemption from capital gains,47
NA,tax for property settlements arising out of a,47
NA,"marriage breakdown, to 20 September 1985.",47
NA,It seems to me the amendment is based upon,47
NA,"the expectation that, on the one hand, there",47
NA,will be a surplus arising from the disposal of,47
NA,assets which could be the subject a property,47
NA,"settlement. On the other hand, there could",47
NA,be losses involved. The property or busi-,47
NA,nesses c.ould have been acquired post 20 Sep-,47
NA,"tember 1985, and a capital loss, arising out",48
NA,"of a settlement, could have been incurred.",48
NA,Mr Beale-The lights are dimming on your,48
NA,"Government, my friend.",48
NA,NA,48
NA,the honourable member a long time ago. The,48
NA,effect of this amendment will be to preclude,48
NA,"any capital loss, for the purposes of the",48
NA,"capital gains tax, being taken into account",48
NA,"for the benefit of one of the spouses, by",48
NA,backdating it to 20 September 1985. So it,48
NA,covers a period between September 1985 and,48
NA,"January 1988. Be that as it may, the respon-",48
NA,sibility for that lies at the feet of the,48
NA,sition. Given that the legislation has been,48
NA,"amended by the Senate against our will, we",48
NA,in this place have no alternative but to ac-,48
NA,cept it. But let responsibility rest where it,48
NA,belongs: any consequences that flow out of,48
NA,this that are detrimental to the spouse con-,48
NA,cerned will be the responsibility of the,48
NA,Opposition.,48
NA,NA,48

NA,Debate resumed.,48
Mrs DARLING ,Lilley) (5.09)-The,48
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and his able,48
NA,supporting Ministers outlined earlier today,48
NA,the terms of Australian participation in the,48
NA,peacekeeping forces in Namibia. They said,48
NA,that the Holsworthy based 17 Construction,48
NA,"Squadron, and the Chief Engineer, Head-",48
NA,"quarters, comprising 300 engineers and sup-",48
NA,"port staff, will leave for Namibia in March,",48
NA,with vehicles and equipment expected to,48
NA,leave by sea later this month.,48
NA,"UNTAG, the United Nations Transitional",48
NA,"Assistance Group, will monitor the imple-",48
NA,mentation of the transition to independence,48
NA,"for Namibia. It is appropriate, given Aus-",48
NA,tralia's record in peacekeeping activities in-,48
NA,"ternationally, that our forces will be",48
NA,undertaking non-combative duties. The Aus-,48
NA,"tralians will be involved mainly in road,",48
NA,"bridge, airfield and accommodation construc-",48
NA,"tion, and in the maintenance of power and",48
NA,"water supplies for a 4,600 strong UN force.",48
NA,A field engineer element of the contingent,48
NA,will carry out min-field clearance. The troops,48
NA,"will be in Namibia initially for 12 months,",48
NA,with a six-month tour of duty for contingent,48
NA,members.,48
NA,It is appropriate to note the bipartisan,48
NA,support of the statement of the Prime Min-,48
NA,ister on this action and to say that Australia,48
NA,Oppofirst offered engineers for UNTAG in 1979.,48
NA,The offer was confirmed by the present Gov-,48
NA,ernment in 1983 and again in September last,48
NA,year. I am one of two members of this House,48
NA,who were privileged to participate in the,48
NA,Australian delegation to the United Nations,48
NA,in 1988. I acknowledge the cooperation and,48
NA,"contribution of my partner, the honourable",48
NA,member for Moreton ( Mr Donald Cameron).,48
NA,. I wish to comment on the background to,48
NA,Australia's involvement in UN peacekeeping,48
NA,forces and in particular the matter under,48
NA,"discussion, Namibia, from a United Nations",48
NA,perspective. In doing this I would like to put,48
NA,on record the excellent performance of offi-,48
NA,cers of the Australian permanent mission to,48
NA,the United Nations in New York. Australia,48
NA,enjoys a high reputation in the United Na-,48
NA,tions and internationally owing to the integ-,48
NA,rity and the dynamism of the contributions,48
NA,of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and of our,48
NA,diplomats at the United Nations and mis-,48
NA,sions across the globe. It is important for us,48
NA,to remember this factor when we comment,48
NA,on the Prime Minister's statement today. It,48
NA,"nas been a long, drawn out process in which",48
NA,Namibians have striven to gain their. inde-,48
NA,pendence with the support of the United,48
NA,Nations. It is important for us to recognise,48
NA,that this is no sudden movement; it is a very,48
NA,long movement. The diplomats at the per-,48
NA,manent mission in New York have played a,48
NA,very strong part in our reaching this point.,48
NA,It is because of their contribution within the,48
NA,forum of the United Nations that we have,48
NA,reached this point. I particularly commend,48
NA,"Mr Kevin Boreham, who is the Deputy",48
NA,Commissioner of our mission and who takes,48
NA,responsibility for our contribution to peace-,48
NA,"keeping forces generally, and Ms Mary",48
NA,"Wickes, who is responsible for Namibia which",48
NA,is of one of the last vestiges of colonialism,49
NA,globally. Both of these people have been,49
NA,working with officers in the Department in,49
NA,Australia and with Ministers and have been,49
NA,able to put forward very strong points of,49
NA,view. They have fulfilled a bridging role be-,49
NA,tween United Nations (UN) delegates rep-,49
NA,"resenting the superpowers. Australia, despite",49
NA,"its smaller population, has most certainly",49
NA,been up front in this operation.,49
NA,Australia is a significant contributor to,49
NA,peacekeeping operations. Apart from the as-,49
NA,"sessed contribution to UNIMOG, the United",49
NA,"Nations Military Observer Group, UNIFIL,",49
NA,"the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, UNDOF,",49
NA,the United Nations Disengagement Observer,49
NA,"Force, UNEF, the UN Emergency Force,",49
NA,and our voluntary annual contribution to,49
NA,"UNICEF, the UN International Children's",49
NA,"Emergency Fund, Australia provides 20 po-",49
NA,"lice to serve the UNFICYP, the United Na-",49
NA,tions Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. We have,49
NA,13 observers to the United Nations truce,49
NA,supervisory organisation and most recently,49
NA,we have joined other contributors in provid-,49
NA,ing 15 observers to UNIMOG. Australia has,49
NA,reaffirmed our commitment to providing the,49
NA,engineering unit to UNT AG and we fully,49
NA,share the concern that burdens on contrib-,49
NA,"uting countries should be minimised, partic-",49
NA,ularly given the number of developing,49
NA,countries on which this burden is very heavy.,49
NA,Australia's view is that UN members should,49
NA,"participate in peacekeeping forces only for, a",49
NA,specified period of one term plus a possible,49
NA,second term. Australia will be guided by this,49
NA,principle in its participation in future peace-,49
NA,"keeping forces, including UNTAG. UNTAG",49
NA,will monitor the cessation of hostilities by,49
NA,parties and the implementation of the tran- .,49
NA,sition to independence for Namibia.,49
NA,One of the major points put forward by,49
NA,our delegation in New York was the annual,49
NA,cost of current and envisaged peacekeeping,49
NA,"operations, which is well above the annual",49
NA,cost of running the UN itself. The Australian,49
NA,delegation takes a leading role in promoting,49
NA,"greater cost effectiveness in UN bodies, in-",49
NA,cluding the operation of the peacekeeping,49
NA,forces. We believe that peacekeeping opera-,49
NA,tions should not be used to palliate regional,49
NA,problems or to delay their resolution. There,49
NA,is no substitute for the peaceful settlement,49
NA,of disputes. A member State should adhere,49
NA,strictly to the provisions of the UN charter,49
NA,regarding the non-use of force. But the,49
NA,"charter itself recognises, in providing for",49
NA,"peacekeeping operations, that these princi-",49
NA,ples will sometimes break down. We must,49
NA,remember that the UN peacekeeping forces,49
NA,are one of the success stories of the United,49
NA,"Nations, as was recognised when that body",49
NA,was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1988.,49
NA,Australia has had a particular interest in,49
NA,"the question of Namibia, which has been on",49
NA,the UN agenda since the very first session of,49
NA,the General Assembly in 1946. Australia has,49
NA,consistently supported the people of Nami-,49
NA,bia in their struggle for self-determination,49
NA,"and independence, and we continue to do so.",49
NA,We have also persistently adhered to our,49
NA,belief that the implementation of proposals,49
NA,contained in Security Council resolution 435,49
NA,of 1978 offers the best possible process and,49
NA,path to independence for Namibia. Today,49
NA,the Prime Minister has confirmed that we,49
NA,"are ready to back our statements, made in-",49
NA,"ternationally and in the United Nations, with",49
NA,practical action. The history of Namibia's,49
NA,struggle for independence is long-far too,49
NA,"long. After World War II, the UN requested",49
NA,that South Africa place the territory under,49
NA,UN trusteeship. South Africa refused and,49
NA,until recently the territory has been the sub-,49
NA,ject of continuing dispute between South,49
NA,Africa and the United Nations.,49
NA,The South West Africa People's Organi-,49
NA,sation (SW APO) has been fighting South,49
NA,Africa for the liberation of Namibia since,49
NA,"1972, from bases mainly in Angola. For over",49
NA,10 years after South Africa agreed to take,49
NA,"part in the UN package, aimed at easing",49
NA,all Namibia's peaceful transition to independ-,49
NA,"ence from the South African Government,",49
NA,"that Government refused, for a variety of",49
NA,"stated reasons, to come to the discussion",49
NA,table. At this stage I am presenting a major-,49
NA,ity view to the House: an opinion that was,49
NA,transmitted by a large number of people,49
NA,sitting in the General Assembly of the UN.,49
NA,After the UN agreed that the different par-,49
NA,ties should discuss the problem to devise a,49
NA,practical means of withdrawing troops and,49

NA,"ence in Namibia, South Africa, whilst main-",49
NA,"taining membership of the United Nations,",49
NA,ceased taking its place in the Assembly. It,49
NA,had taken its marbles and gone home. There,49
NA,was no delegate from South Africa in the,50
NA,United Nations whereas there were delegates,50
NA,"from all of the other parties, involved in the",50
NA,plan for a peaceful transition. Although Op-,50
NA,position members have brought up other,50
NA,"concerns, South Africa had to come to t-e",50
NA,discussion table if it was to demonstrate Its,50
NA,credibility and show that it wanted to find a,50
NA,peaceful solution. South Africa did not come,50
NA,"to the table. However, I welcome the fact",50
NA,that South Africa has now decided to coop-,50
NA,erate with the UN in the implementation of,50
NA,proposals for the independence of Namibia.,50
NA,The signing of the Brazzaville protocol in,50
NA,"late 1988 by South Africa, Cuba and Angola",50
NA,has formalised the acceptance by South Af-,50
NA,"rica of resolution UNSCR 435 1978, which",50
NA,outlined a blueprint for the realisation of,50
NA,independence for. Namibia. The dat- set. for,50
NA,the implementation of the resolutIOn IS 1,50
NA,April 1989. Over the period of transition t?,50
NA,independence it is intended that South Afn-,50
NA,"can troops will withdraw from Namibia, .Cu-",50
NA,"ban troops will begin leaving Angola, Afncan",50
NA,National Congress camps will leave Angola,50
NA,and SWAPO will be allowed to participate,50
NA,in the elections for an independent govern-,50
NA,ment of Namibia to be held in November,50
NA,"1989. The UNTAG, along with civilian rep-",50
NA,resentatives will be deployed to Namibia,50
NA,during the transitional period to assist in the,50
NA,implementation of UNSCR 435.,50
NA,Australia has been a committed member,50
NA,of the UN Council for Namibia since 1974.,50
NA,We have been an active participant in coun-,50
NA,cil and committee activities during that time,50
NA,and will continue to i be so. Australia will,50
NA,also continue its voluntary contributions to,50
NA,the UN Fund for Namibia. The time may,50
NA,be approaching when it will be necessary t?,50
NA,look more closely at the role of the Counctl,50
NA,"for. Namibia, particularly if the ongoing ne-",50
NA,gotiations move to a successful conclusion. It,50
NA,may then become necessary to define in more,50
NA,detail the Council's role in the transitional,50
NA,period. The Bureau of the Council and the,50
NA,Office of the UN Commissioner for Namibia,50
NA,have already turned their attention to these,50
NA,matters. I grieve with other people the loss,50
NA,of the UN Commissioner who died in tragic,50
NA,circumstances in the Lockerbie disaster. The,50
NA,Australian delegation is looking closely at th-,50
NA,"situation in Namibia, the role of the Counctl",50
NA,and the office of the UN Commissioner and,50
NA,is ready to play a constructive and active,50
NA,role in any discussions.,50
NA,In September last year Australia had the,50
NA,pleasure of welcoming a mission of consul-,50
NA,tation led by Council President Ambassador,50
NA,"Peter Zuze, the first such mission to Aus-",50
NA,tralia since 1984. That mission briefed the,50
NA,"Government on the situation in Namibia,",50
NA,met with the parliamentary Joint Committee,50
NA,"on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and",50
NA,held talks with senior officials of a number,50
NA,of major government dep-rtments. I woul-,50
NA,like to take this opportumty to express thIS,50
NA,nation's gratitude for the demonstrated en-,50
NA,ergy and sense of purpose displayed by Am-,50
NA,bassador Zuze in leading the Council. We,50
NA,would certainly be looking to his continuing,50
NA,that leadership in the future.,50
NA,Australia has played a key role in this,50
NA,area. I wish to bring to the attention of the,50
NA,House the role played by the Australian,50
NA,delegation to the UN in the matters which,50
NA,we are discussing today. I am sure the ap-,50
NA,preciation and best wishes of all -arliamen­,50
NA,"tarians go with Colonel Warren, Lleutenant-",50
NA,"Colonel Pippard, Major -rago and the ?-O",50
NA,Australians whom they WIll lead to NamIbIa,50
NA,in the interests of a peaceful transition to,50
NA,independence for the war-torn people of,50
NA,Namibia.,50
Mr WHITE ,MCPherson)(5.24)-As has,50
NA,already been indicated by the Leader of the,50
NA,Opposition ( Mr Howard) and other spe-k.ers,50
NA,"from this side of the House, the OppOSItion",50
NA,supports the deployment of the Australian,50
NA,contingent to Namibia. M-mbers of .the c-n­,50
NA,tingent go with the best WIshes of thiS Parha-,50
NA,ment and the Australian people. While the,50
NA,position taken by the Opposition of agreeing,50
NA,"with the Government, is somewhat unusual,",50
NA,it is pleasant and good to see. The Fraser,50
NA,"commitment of 1978, which was formalised",50
NA,in 1979 has been reaffirmed by this Govern-,50
NA,ment. It is very much in Australia's inter-sts,50
NA,that we participate in these pe-cekeeplI-g,50
NA,"operations around the world, particularly m",50
NA,the region in which we live.,50
NA,"This deployment of troops will be difficult,",50
NA,"as other speakers have said, and there will",50
NA,be occasions when it will be dangerous. We,50
NA,are talking about an uncontrolled situation,50
NA,in which there may be a requirement for -ur,50
NA,soldiers to defend themselves. We are talkmg,50
NA,about the clearance of mines in a climate of,51
NA,largely uncontrolled warfare that has gone,51
NA,"on in Namibia for some years. Indeed, we",51
NA,are talking about a dangerous operation. But,51
NA,Australian engineers are well trained and,51
NA,their expertise in these sorts of operations-,51
NA,"for instance, in Vietnam-has been well",51
NA,noted. Some of the bravest men I have ever,51
NA,met were Australian engineers in Vietnam.,51
NA,So I have no doubts about their capacity to,51
NA,do the job.,51
NA,From what has been said today by Gov-,51
NA,"ernment spokesmen, the conditions of service",51
NA,under which our troops will be operating,51
NA,appear to be adequate. But we have to ask,51
NA,why it has been left to the last minute for,51
NA,these conditions of service· to be put on re-,51
NA,cord. The advance party goes next week and,51
NA,the troops a week or so after that. They,51
NA,have been carrying out training for all this,51
NA,time not knowing under which conditions of,51
NA,service they will be operating and what their,51
NA,benefits will be. It is not as though this,51
NA,commitment has been sprung on us by sur-,51
NA,prise. We have had this commitment since,51
NA,1978. The Government has eventually got,51
NA,around to deciding on the conditions of serv-,51
NA,ice a week before the servicemen leave for,51
NA,"Namibia. As I understand it, the observers",51
NA,that we recently sent to the Persian Gulf in,51
NA,another form of peacekeeping operation did,51
NA,not even know until after they got there,51
NA,exactly what their conditions of service were,51
NA,to be.,51
NA,While the general benefits and cOl!ditions,51
NA,of service may be. acceptable-and we will,51
NA,have to have a look at them in more detail-,51
NA,"there is one matter which my colleague, the",51
NA,"shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, the",51
NA,honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim,51
NA,"Fischer), will take up in more detail, namely,",51
NA,the question of repatriation benefits. I am,51
NA,glad to see the Minister for Veterans' Affairs,51
NA,"( Mr Humphreys) at, the table. Once again I",51
NA,ask the Minister: how is it that a force that,51
NA,has been warned about overseas service for,51
NA,something like 10 years will be leaving this,51
NA,country presumably not knowing what its,51
NA,repatriation benefits will be when it comes,51
NA,back? It is an absolute' disgrace that we,51
NA,expect our servicemen to go overseas not,51
NA,knowing under what conditions they are,51
NA,serving. I ask the Minister to use all his,51
NA,efforts to get this matter resolved before,51
NA,"those men go. After 10 years, the Govern-",51
NA,ment has still not made up its mind. I really,51
NA,do not understand that.,51
NA,The Department of Industrial Relations is,51
NA,interfering in regard to the general conditions,51
NA,that apply to this force. Apparently it is,51
NA,being given carte blanche to decide what,51
NA,conditions should apply to the Department,51
NA,of Defence. That in itself is something I find,51
NA,"extraordinary. That is the reason, no doubt,",51
NA,for the long delays in getting this matter,51
NA,resolved. That is what happens when the,51
NA,government directs that the employment,51
NA,conditions of the Department of Defence,51
NA,and the Australian Defence Force be decided,51
NA,by the Department of Industrial Relations.,51
NA,The Government can find the effort and the,51
NA,energy to make conditions and benefits rea-,51
NA,"sonably attractive when soldiers, sailors and",51
NA,"airmen actually have to go and do a job, but",51
NA,"in times of peace, when it is thought they",51
NA,"will not be required, the Government re-",51
NA,duces those benefits; it reduces the status of,51
NA,members of the Defence Force to that of,51
NA,second class citizens. The Government has,51
NA,"to wake up to itself. If it wants engineers, or",51
NA,"anybody else, to go and do a job it has to",51
NA,look after them in times of peace as well. If,51
NA,"it does not, at the end of the day, as is",51
NA,"gradually happening now, it will not have",51
NA,anyone to do the job that the country ex-,51
NA,pects of them.,51
NA,"Australian troops overseas, in war and in",51
NA,"peacekeeping operations, have a reputation",51
NA,second to none. I am quite sure that this,51
NA,contingent will maintain that record. Some,51
NA,weeks ago I sought permission to visit the,51
NA,contingent at Holsworthy before it went. I,51
NA,got a most extraordinary letter from the,51
NA,Minister saying he did not think it would be,51
NA,convenient. I indicated that there was going,51
NA,"to be one hell of a row about it, and the",51
NA,Minister changed his mind. ',51
NA,The point I make is that the Government,51
NA,and Ministers do not own the Defence Force;,51
NA,the force is part and parcel of the Australian,51
NA,community. The Government might be in,51
NA,"temporary control, but if the shadow Minis-",51
NA,"ter for defence, or anybody else, asks to go",51
NA,"and farewell them, to wish them well and to",51
NA,ensure that they know they have the support,51
NA,"of the Opposition, it is certainly not up to",51
NA,the Minister for Defence to deny that re-,51
NA,> quest. I am pleased that the Minister's deci-,51
NA,"sion has been changed. In fact, the Leader",52
NA,of the Opposition and I and the shadow,52
NA,"Minister for defence personnel, Senator",52
NA,"Newman, will be visiting the contingent this",52
NA,Sunday.,52
NA,The implications of this deployment to,52
NA,Namibia are quite widespread. There are,52
NA,some beneficial implications. It shows that,52
NA,Australia is playing its part in seeking to,52
NA,maintain the peace around the world. It will,52
NA,be invaluable experience for our engineers. I,52
NA,"think it is a pity, certainly initially, that only",52
NA,engineers are going. I would have preferred,52
NA,to see a more balanced force where people,52
NA,from other corps got experience in these,52
NA,sorts of operations and brought that experi-,52
NA,ence back into the different corps of the,52
NA,Army. That is not to be. I understand the,52
NA,problem. The United Nations force has to,52
NA,be balanced and Australia agreed to provide,52
NA,"the engineer contingent, but I am disap-",52
NA,pointed that the Government did not seek,52
NA,to change that commitment so that we could,52
NA,have provided a commitment of all arms.,52
NA,The other good thing about this is that we,52
NA,"will see, perhaps not initially but eventually,",52
NA,reservists used as part of this contingent. It,52
NA,is very important at a time when the Reserve,52
NA,numbers are declining-when those that come,52
NA,in are leaving within 12 months-that they,52
NA,"are given the opportunity to serve, as they",52
NA,"should be, as the reserve component of one",52
NA,army. The Reserve and the Australian Def-,52
NA,ence Force have a great deal to offer. Un-,52
NA,"fortunately, they are not being used properly.",52
NA,There are some adverse implications. It is,52
NA,quite clear that the manpower policies of,52
NA,this Government have allowed our defence,52
NA,forces to run down. We have said that many,52
NA,times before. A defence force is not there,52
NA,just to sustain itself; it is there to do a job.,52
NA,Look at the wide eyes and the looks of,52
NA,surprise on the faces of Government mem-,52
NA,bers when they are actually asked to do a,52
NA,job like providing a contingent for Namibia.,52
NA,"Some 300 engineers are going this month,",52
NA,another 300 or so in six months and maybe,52
NA,another 300 after that. It will make life,52
NA,"difficult, because of the shortage of man-",52
NA,"power in the Australian Army, to fulfil all",52
NA,the commitments which should be fulfilled,52
NA,by it. A policy of wastage· and deliberate,52
NA,reductions in the manpower ceilings of units,52
NA,has brought this about. It is not as though,52
NA,this is going to be a one-off. The fact is that,52
NA,"we can expect more of these commitments,",52
NA,"particularly in our own region, a region which",52
NA,is showing increasing signs of instability and,52
NA,in which we should be much more involved.,52
NA,One of the other problems with this de-,52
NA,"ployment is that, despite what the Govern-",52
NA,"ment says, we all know that our commitments",52
NA,under the defence cooperation program will,52
NA,have to be reduced. That is a great pity,52
NA,"because that defence cooperation program,",52
NA,"far from being reduced, should be greatly",52
NA,expanded. It is Australia's demonstration that,52
NA,"it is, and wants to be, involved in the region",52
NA,in which we live. It is time the Government,52
NA,came to grips with the isolationist policy it,52
NA,"has followed, particularly in the last two",52
NA,years since the production of the White Pa-,52
NA,"per, and threw it out of the window and",52
NA,"said, 'Yes, we are involved. This is our re-",52
NA,gion; we are going to make a major contri-,52
NA,bution to keeping the peace because that is,52
NA,essential to the security of this country'. One,52
NA,does not adopt these isolationist policies and,52
NA,sit back with a defence of mainland Aus-,52
NA,"tralia concept and say, 'Come and get us if",52
NA,"you can'. It is stupid, it is discredited, and it",52
NA,is time it was changed.,52
NA,One of the commitments we should have,52
NA,undertaken last year and the year before was,52
NA,a reasonable commitment to the Persian Gulf.,52
NA,"Certainly we have observers there now, but",52
NA,what was Australia's response when the war,52
NA,in the Persian Gulf was creating enormous,52
NA,difficulties for the Western world in particu-,52
NA,"lar in the supply of oil, when international",52
NA,sea lanes of communication were being,52
NA,threatened? Under this Government the re-,52
NA,"sponse was, 'We will put some divers on",52
NA,stand-by in Perth'. A pathetic commitment.,52
NA,The Government has to realise that Austral-,52
NA,ia's contribution to these peacekeeping op-,52
NA,erations has to be made if we are to have,52
NA,any credibility in the Western world as a,52
NA,reliable ally.,52
NA,I have touched briefly on the role of re-,52
NA,servists. I am very pleased to see that two,52
NA,"have been included in the initial contingent,",52
NA,"with a promise of more to come. Once again,",52
NA,the implication of this deployment of troops,52
NA,is the reconsideration of the role of the Re-,52
NA,serve. In Australia we have a very small ',52
NA,regular component but we have an enormous,52
NA,reservoir of reservists who have shown over,52
NA,"the years that they are capable, with train-",53
NA,"ing, of doing the job. What we have to",53
NA,realise is that they need to be told that this,53
NA,is their role and not be left withering on the,53
NA,"shelf, with lack of equipment and lack of",53
NA,"proper direction, looking for a job to do.",53
NA,In this context I would very much ques-,53
NA,tion that the role of so many of the Reserve,53
NA,units is the guarding of static facilities,53
NA,war break out. The Minister here last week-,53
NA,and I agree with him-came to the conclu-,53
NA,sion again that a major threat to the Austra-,53
NA,"lian mainland was not likely. If that is so,",53
NA,why are we wasting all this money on Kan-,53
NA,"garoo 89, for example, when we have this",53
NA,"commitment, this requirement, to get more",53
NA,and more involved in our region? Why are,53
NA,"we wasting $100m on Kangaroo 89, which is",53
NA,basically an exercise for the defence of the,53
NA,"Australian mainland, when the Minister is",53
NA,currently scouring the Defence Force for,53
NA,"further cuts, such as another FI8 squadron",53
NA,"to go, anFlll squadron to go, further man-",53
NA,"power cuts, further ships to be taken out of",53
NA,service? It is a ridiculous concept. What I,53
NA,am saying is that the role of the Reserve,53
NA,should be reconsidered so that it can play a,53
NA,more active part within the Defence Force.,53
NA,In conclusion I just want to say this: Gov-,53
NA,ernment speakers this afternoon have con-,53
NA,demned the role of South Africa-and I,53
NA,think that role is highly suspect. But it should,53
NA,"be remembered, and I put it on the record,",53
NA,that for the last 10 years or so there have,53
NA,"been 50,000 Cuban troops serving in Angola",53
NA,"and Namibia, and it is about time the Cu-",53
NA,bans were given the condemnation the Gov-,53
NA,"ernment so freely gives to South Africa,",53
NA,"which, after all, is going to supply a great",53
NA,deal of the logistic support for this force,53
NA,under very difficult circumstances.,53
Mr TICKNER ,Hughes) (5.39)-1 do not,53
NA,propose to speak this afternoon for all my,53
NA,allotted time but it would be remiss of me if,53
NA,I were not to make some substantial com-,53
NA,ment since I am the Federal member for the,53
NA,"seat of Hughes, from which these troops will",53
NA,leave. I also speak in my capacity as the,53
NA,convener Qf the Government members' def-,53
NA,"ence forces action committee, so I have a",53
NA,very special interest in the subject matter of,53
NA,this debate. I do not propose to descend into,53
NA,petty party point scoring and to demean this,53
NA,"occasion, as I believe the shadow Minister",53
NA,"for defence, the honourable member for",53
NA,"MCPherson ( Mr White), has done, but rather",53
NA,to speak about what I believe are the high-,53
NA,"minded principles, the idealism and commit-",53
NA,ment to a peaceful and more secure world,53
NA,which lie at the heart of the debate before,53
NA,the House this afternoon.,53
NA,"However, I make the comment that we on",53
NA,"should this side of the chamber, the Australian",53
NA,people and the defence forces and their fam-,53
NA,ilies in this country will start to take the,53
NA,Opposition seriously when it debates defence,53
NA,"policy and does two things. That will be,",53
NA,"first, when the honourable member for",53
NA,MCPherson is elevated to the shadow Cabi-,53
NA,net. At the moment he really is not regarded,53
NA,as a prominent member of the Opposition,53
NA,"and, for that reason, defence has been effec-",53
NA,tively downgraded in the eyes of service per-,53
NA,sonnel and their families. The second thing,53
NA,that has to be done for the Opposition to,53
NA,gain any credibility at all in matters pertain-,53
NA,ing to defence is for it somehow to manage,53
NA,to reconcile the massive inconsistencies be-,53
NA,tween the expressed fiscal policies of the,53
NA,Opposition and the very bland assurances,53
NA,that we have from the shadow Minister on,53
NA,"defence expenditure. Having said that, I make",53
NA,. it very clear that I believe this is a debate,53
NA,that ought to rally all the Parliament around,53
NA,the single call of support for the Australian,53
NA,Defence Force. To the very great credit of,53
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard),53
NA,"and the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), they",53
NA,managed to do just that.,53
NA,"We, in the Australian Labor Party, are",53
NA,"extremely proud of our contribution, as a",53
NA,"country, to the United Nations, since the",53
NA,formation of that very important body.,53
NA,People sometimes forget the role that Dr,53
NA,Evatt played in the conference in San Fran-,53
NA,cisco in April 1945 at which he was a driving,53
NA,force for reform and for the strengthening of,53
NA,the United Nations charter. Even the New,53
NA,"York Times recorded, when Dr Evatt finally",53
NA,"left that conference, that he had arrived as",53
NA,"virtually an unknown single, second-string",53
NA,delegate with the background of a professor,53
NA,and Labor politician but left recognised as,53
NA,the most brilliant and effective voice of the,53
NA,small powers: he was a leading statesman for,53
NA,the world's conscience. Dr Evatt's contribu-,53
NA,tion was not just a contribution for his party,53
NA,and his ideals: it was a contribution for Aus-,54
NA,tralia and the world.,54
NA,The peacekeeping contingent that we are,54
NA,"sending to Namibia is, as I have indicated,",54
NA,something from which all Australians can,54
NA,take great pride. In his speech to the House,54
NA,"this afternoon, the Prime Minister talked",54
NA,"about the concerns that had existed, about",54
NA,the arc of instability stretching from south-,54
NA,"ern Africa through the Persian Gulf, through",54
NA,Afghanistan and southern Asia on to Indo-,54
NA,China. He said-and I commend him for his,54
NA,vision-that we now see if not an arc of,54
NA,"peace at least an arc of peacemaking. We,",54
NA,"as the Government of this country, are very",54
NA,proud to be associated with that initiative.,54
NA,The previous speakers in this debate have,54
NA,talked at very great length about the very,54
NA,significant details of the contribution being,54
NA,made to the peacekeeping force. Suffice it to,54
NA,say that almost one-half of the Australian,54
NA,Army capability will be participating in that,54
NA,peacekeeping force. Having had the oppor-,54
NA,"tunity, some considerable time ago, to visit",54
NA,the troqps that will be going to Namibia and,54
NA,to see the vehicles and the heavy equipment,54
NA,painted with the United Nations logo in,54
NA,"white, I was extremely proud to see that",54
NA,Australia could participate in that way to,54
NA,work towards the creation of a better world.,54
NA,"Of course, it is not the first time that we",54
NA,have participated in that way. We have a,54
NA,long history of participation going right back,54
NA,to 1947 and 1950. I mention our participa-,54
NA,"tion on the UN Committee for Indonesia,",54
NA,our contribution to the Balkans and our,54
NA,presence in the Sinai. The list goes on. I,54
NA,stress that the participation in those efforts,54
NA,has generally been with the bipartisan sup-,54
NA,port of the Parliament as a whole.,54
NA,"As the Prime Minister indicated, the issue",54
NA,of Namibia has been on the international,54
NA,agenda for 70 years. It is a credit to the UN,54
NA,"that, finally, a tortuous path to the resolution",54
NA,of that conflict and occupation in Namibia,54
NA,has finally been negotiated. The goal of in-,54
NA,dependence and self-determination for the,54
NA,people of Namibia is a cause that I have,54
NA,long been very proud to be associated with.,54
NA,"I must say that, when the shadow Minister",54
NA,for defence referred to the· South African,54
NA,"role as highly suspect, I thought he was",54
NA,mildly understating by a factor of about 100,54
NA,the South African role of occupation over,54
NA,the last 70 years.,54
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-And the Cuban role.,54
Mr TICKNER,And the Cuban role. My,54
NA,position is straight down the middle. My,54
NA,great regret is that that support for inde-,54
NA,pendence and self-determination is not ap-,54
NA,parently shared by that one speaker within,54
NA,the Opposition.,54
NA,I particularly want to comment on the,54
NA,conditions of service of the personnel. Here,54
NA,"again, it is a pity that the debate was low-",54
NA,ered to a party partisan contribution. It seems,54
NA,to me that all the Parliament ought to be,54
NA,satisfied with the conditions that have been,54
NA,secured for service personnel. The shadow,54
NA,Minister took us back to 1978 and expressed,54
NA,"concern that, through all that time, nothing",54
NA,had been done to resolve the precise condi-,54
NA,tions of service. I knew that we were often,54
NA,called on by the Opposition to answer for its,54
NA,version of the sins of our Government but I,54
NA,did not really think that we were responsible,54
NA,for taking the knocks for the actions of the,54
NA,Fraser Government back in 1978. Be that as,54
NA,"it may, as the convener of the Government",54
NA,"members defence forces action committee, I",54
NA,"have been determined, along with my Labor",54
NA,colleagues representing defence constituen-,54
NA,"cies, to ensure that the conditions of service",54
NA,of these troops were second to none.,54
NA,I am very pleased that the Minister for,54
NA,"Defence Science and Personnel ( Mrs Kelly),",54
NA,"who shared our concern, has been successful",54
NA,in arguing the case for justice and fairness,54
NA,for these troops and their families. I believe,54
NA,that the Armed Forces Federation and its,54
NA,"Federal President, Mr Bob Copley, will be",54
NA,pleased with the result because they too,54
NA,strongly supported the conditions of service.,54
NA,I do not propose to talk in detail about those,54
NA,conditions of service because they have been,54
NA,referred to by a number of speakers in the,54
NA,course of this debate but I believe that they,54
NA,will meet with wide support. Those condi-,54
NA,tions are not some form of charity; they are,54
NA,the right for those service personnel-and,54
NA,the families-because their lives are on the,54
NA,"line. Even up to 1985, some 650 personnel",54
NA,had lost their lives in the United Nations·,54
NA,"peacekeeping forces. Of course, that figure is",54
NA,"higher now. When they go to Namibia, our",54
NA,"own servicemen will, in many cases, be",54
NA,working in dangerous areas. It is their right,55
NA,to have adequate support and their families',55
NA,right to ensure that they have adequate sup-,55
NA,port and remuneration commensurate with,55
NA,their responsibilities.,55
NA,I conclude on this note: we have a great,55
NA,deal to be pleased about in the advance that,55
NA,the region and the world are making in re-,55
NA,spect of Namibia. It is indeed a significant,55
NA,step for the resolution of a conflict that has,55
NA,"threatened that region and, at times, the",55
NA,wider planet. In South Africa there still re-,55
NA,mains a further blot on the international,55
NA,"landscape. It is my hope that, in the years",55
NA,"to pass, we will be able to stand as members",55
NA,of Parliament in this chamber and support,55
NA,an active United Nations role in resolving,55
NA,the problems of South Africa.,55
Mr TIM FISCHER ,Farrer) (5.49)-It,55
NA,is time to inject some reality into this debate.,55
NA,By virtue of the statement of the Prime,55
NA,"Minister ( Mr Hawke), the Government has",55
NA,committed some 300 Australian soldiers to a,55
NA,"distant part of the African continent. In fact,",55
NA,the commitment is to the west coast of the,55
NA,"African continent, to that war-torn country",55
NA,"of Namibia which adjoins Angola, Zambia,",55
NA,"Zimbabwe, Botswana and, of course, South",55
NA,Africa. Let there be no doubt about the,55
NA,deadly seriousness of the situation faced by,55
NA,these Australian diggers heading off to that,55
NA,"distant land in 1989. In one sense, it is his-",55
NA,tory repeating itself. Whilst the guerilla war-,55
NA,fare has waxed and waned over recent years,55
NA,with the presence of large numbers of Cuban,55
NA,guerillas and troops from various other coun-,55
NA,"tries, including South Africa, the reality is",55
NA,that there are still lingering remnants of that,55
NA,guerilla war.,55
NA,"Equally, there are minefields which :will",55
NA,have to be addressed by the Australian con-,55
NA,tingent. I have to tell the House that it is,55
NA,"chilling terror to have to work in any way,",55
NA,shape or form in an operational sense with,55
NA,minefields-entering minefields and clearing,55
NA,areas which were mined during the course of,55
NA,that terrorist war. It can be the most peace-,55
NA,"ful, tranquil scene, but that can be tran-",55
NA,formed in a matter of just one second to,55
NA,"instant death or massive injury, -and horrific",55
NA,situations can arise very quickly when mines,55
NA,are detonated in the process of clearing,55
NA,minefields and passing through areas near to,55
NA,where the mines have been sown. It certainly,55
NA,"requires absolute professionalism, and I have",55
NA,no doubt that members of the Australian,55
NA,Army will be providing that absolute profes-,55
NA,sionalism with our commitment in the course,55
NA,of the next month or so when they go to,55
NA,"Namibia. I just feel that the House, sitting",55
NA,here in this remote location of Canberra in,55
NA,"this wonderful new Parliament House, ought",55
NA,"to be aware, in terms of this debate, that we",55
NA,are committing Australian soldiers to quite a,55
NA,dangerous situation. The real element of,55
NA,danger will not emerge perhaps ilntil after,55
NA,the first tour of duty over the first six months,55
NA,"has been completed. Therefore, it is some-",55
NA,thing that the House should not do lightly.,55
NA,In terms of the historical context of a,55
NA,"debate of a similar nature, I went back",55
NA,through Hansard to find the debates relating,55
NA,to the original commitment of an Australian,55
NA,force to Vietnam. I remind the House that,55
NA,"Sir Robert Menzies, as Prime Minister, made",55
NA,a similar type of ministerial statement on 29,55
NA,"April 1965. Having made that statement,",55
NA,having revealed the invitation and having,55
NA,announced the decision of the Australian,55
NA,"Government to send a force to Vietnam, that",55
NA,was followed on 4 May by a reply by the,55
NA,"then Leader of the Opposition, the honour-",55
NA,"able member for Melbourne, Mr Arthur Cal-",55
NA,well. He said:,55
NA,"Therefore, on behalf of all my colleagues of Her",55
NA,"Majesty's Opposition, I say that we oppose the Gov-",55
NA,ernment's decision to send 800 men to fight in Viet-,55
NA,nam. We oppose it firmly and compietely.,55
NA,It is a matter of record in this debate this,55
NA,day with the sending of this contingent to,55
NA,Namibia that the Federal Government on,55
NA,"the one hand, and the Federal Opposition",55
NA,"on the other hand, are extending bipartisan",55
NA,support to the contingent. That is in very,55
NA,sharp contrast to the way in which 800 Aus-,55
NA,tralians were sent to Vietnam under that,55
NA,original ministerial statement in 1965. Of,55
NA,"course, a very divisive period ensued. At no",55
NA,stage did those of us sent to Vietnam enjoy,55
NA,"the unanimous support which, happily, these",55
NA,troops going to Namibia will enjoy conse-,55
NA,quent upon this bipartisan support indicated,55
NA,in the course of this debate.,55
NA,We should perhaps just look for a moment,55
NA,at the country of Namibia. It is on the south-,55
NA,C west coast of Africa and has an area of some,55
NA,"824,269 square kilometres. It lies, as I have",55
NA,"said, in south-west Africa with South Africa",55
NA,"to the south and south-east, Botswana to the",56
NA,east and Angola to the north. The territory,56
NA,has a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean.,56
NA,"Significantly, there are a number of key eth-",56
NA,"nic groups of quite large size, including the",56
NA,"Ovambo of 587,000 and the Kavango of",56
NA,"110,000, with a total population of 1,184,000.",56
NA,Namibia has at various stages in recent years,56
NA,"had over 100,000 troops of one kind or an-",56
NA,"other, including a Cuban contingent of guer-",56
NA,"illas, forces from South Africa and the local",56
NA,army raised by the then South Africa,56
NA,Administration under a national service,56
NA,scheme which was introduced a few short,56
NA,years ago. It is a war ravaged land and a,56
NA,land where mines have been sown. It does,56
NA,require a great deal of help as it moves along,56
NA,"the path to independence and, hopefully, to",56
NA,workable democracy. Australia clearly has a,56
NA,vital role to play. I would join with the,56
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), the Leader of",56
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Howard) and the other,56
NA,speakers in wishing our contingent well.,56
NA,"However, it is I!.bsolutely essential that",56
NA,those who are going know exactly on what,56
NA,grounds and conditions they will be going to,56
NA,"Namibia, how they will be protected, and",56
NA,what arrangements will be made for their,56
NA,next of kin in the event of injury or death.,56
NA,As we have now learnt during the course of,56
NA,"this debate, that has not been spelt out in",56
NA,detail at this stage by the Government. What,56
NA,has been said is that a number of the condi-,56
NA,tions providing for a tax free situation for,56
NA,"the contingent have been approved, which I",56
NA,"welcome and support,along with certain day",56
NA,allowances and so forth for these troops who,56
NA,"will be divided into two basic groups, a head-",56
NA,quarters group back in the Namibian capital,56
NA,and another one towards the northern bor-,56
NA,"der. That is acceptable, but the Government",56
NA,has stopped short of resolving the situation,56
NA,with regard to repatriation cover or peace-,56
NA,keeping force cover under part IV of the,56
NA,Veterans' Entitlements Act or whether there,56
NA,will be a declaration of operational service,56
NA,"or not. That has not yet been resolved, not-",56
NA,withstanding the fact that the Government,56
NA,knew for some time that this debate was,56
NA,"coming up, that it knew for an even longer",56
NA,period that the commitment was coming up,56
NA,and that there had been lengthy discussions,56
NA,about it.,56
NA,"I say to the Minister at the table, the",56
NA,Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr Hum-,56
NA,"phreys), that he has an absolute obligation,",56
NA,in the interests of fair play and in the inter-,56
NA,ests of this Parliament and this Government,56
NA,before the contingent leaves Australian soil,56
NA,"to go to Africa, to resolve this in clear cut",56
NA,terms and do the right thing by those being,56
NA,sent overseas. It is a very serious decision,56
NA,and one which obviously has not been taken,56
NA,"lightly. Equally, the arrangements for their",56
NA,repatriation and their care in the event of,56
NA,injury and/or death have to be spelt out. I,56
NA,"hope that the Minister, in conjunction with",56
NA,the Minister for Defence Science and Per-,56
NA,"sonnel ( Mrs Kelly), will finalise these ar-",56
NA,rangements before the Ides of March so that,56
NA,the troops will know in clear-cut terms where,56
NA,"they stand. Certainly my colleagues, the",56
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard); the,56
NA,"shadow Minister for defence, the honourable",56
NA,member for MCPherson ( Mr White); and the,56
NA,"shadow Minister for defence support, Sena-",56
NA,"tor Newman, who are all visiting the unit",56
NA,"next Sunday, share those concerns, and I",56
NA,assure the Minister that we will be pressing,56
NA,the Government for a clear-cut statement,56
NA,before our soldiers go to conditions in Africa,56
NA,which are going to be very uncertain. These,56
NA,matters need to be resolved.,56
NA,There are two other brief areas I would,56
NA,"mention. Presumably, the forces will be eli-",56
NA,gible for the new Australian Service Medal.,56
NA,It is a great pity that I have to tell the,56
NA,House that 25 years after that speech by,56
NA,Robert Gordon Menzies committing troops,56
NA,to Vietnam there is still a major dispute in,56
NA,relation to the granting of the Vietnam Serv-,56
NA,ice Medal to those who served on HMAS,56
NA,Sydney and other logistical support ships. It,56
NA,has still not been resolved after 2t decades.,56
NA,I do hope that this contingent will qualify,56
NA,for the Australian Service Medal and that,56
NA,that will be clear-cut and will be covered in,56
NA,"the summation. Finally, let me say that the",56
NA,"defence service home loan eligibility, which",56
NA,is normally granted to those who go forward,56
NA,in the service of their country with the Aus-,56
NA,"tralian Army, Royal Australian Navy and",56
NA,"Royal Australian Air Force, has been with-",56
NA,drawn for enlistees who have enlisted since,56
NA,"May 1985. To be fair, they would not be",56
NA,truly eligible until they had completed six,56
NA,years of service. We now have a situation,56
NA,where this quite large contingent of 300,57
NA,"troops is going forward, and again there is a",57
NA,doubt as to whether they will be eligible for,57
NA,"the defence service home loans scheme, which",57
NA,might otherwise be termed the defence serv-,57
NA,"ice caravan loans scheme, as its value has",57
NA,"been static for nine years at a mere $25,000.",57
NA,Notwithstanding the fact that its value has,57
NA,"been eroded, surely those going to Africa in",57
NA,this contingent should have an eligibility for,57
NA,"the defence service home loans scheme, and",57
NA,I hope the Government will clarify this.,57
NA,Mr Humphreys-What are you going to,57
NA,put it up to?,57
Mr TIM FISCHER,The Minister has the,57
NA,"the responsibility, under the terms of his",57
NA,oath of office as Minister for Veterans',57
NA,"Affairs, with regard to this contingent going",57
NA,from Australia to Africa. He must answer,57
NA,the people. and to that contingent and their,57
NA,families with regard to their repatriation,57
NA,"rangements. Hopefully, there will be no",57
NA,juries; hopefully there will be no deaths.,57
NA,we have heard the Minister say that there,57
NA,has to be an expectation of some casualties.,57
NA,So it is a deadly serious business that,57
NA,House is about this afternoon here in Canoverseas,57
NA,"berra, removed from the realities of the Afdanger",57
NA,rican situation or the tensions of a unit,57
NA,"preparing for embarkation from Holsworthy,",57
NA,"Sydney, to Africa.",57
NA,I remind the House that we have very,57
NA,serious obligations that we owe those who,57
NA,are going to serve our country yet again.,57
NA,Surely it is the obligation of each and every,57
NA,"member, and above all the Minister for Vettions",57
NA,"erans' Affairs, to see that",57
NA,are fully honoured. I wish our contingent,57
NA,well in terms of its work and service on,57
NA,behalf of Australia.,57
Mr MACKELLAR ,Warringah) (6.02)- matter,57
NA,"If we look back 10 years almost to the day,",57
NA,we find in the Australian Financial Review,57
NA,of 22 February 1979 the following report of,57
NA,"a speech by the then Prime Minister, Mr the",57
NA,Fraser:,57
NA,We will offer an engineer contingent of 250 officers,57
NA,and men together with a national headquarters and,57
NA,support element of 50 to Namibia or to the UN,57
NA,force to go and supervise-,57
NA,"hopefully, at that stage--....:",57
NA,the transition of Namibia to an in(\ependent state.,57
NA,"Unfortunately, that did not happen at that",57
NA,"stage and now, 10 years down the line, we",57
NA,hear the present Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke),57
NA,reiterating those comments almost in identi-,57
NA,"cal terms. Naturally enough, we on this side",57
NA,of the House support the Prime Minister and,57
NA,the Government in the decision that the,57
NA,Government has taken in committing Aus-,57
NA,tralian troops to the role that they will have,57
NA,in the United Nations (UN) force in,57
NA,Namibia.,57
NA,The role of Australian forces in peacetime,57
NA,but in difficult circumstances is one which,57
NA,they have filled with great distinction in the,57
NA,past. I notice that the Prime Minister said,57
NA,exercise is likely to last about a year. In,57
NA,"the light of previous experience, I hope he is",57
NA,right. But I doubt whether he will be correct,57
NA,in the belief that it will be for only a year.,57
NA,"to As I have said, the Opposition supports the",57
NA,"decision, but it does show up in rather",57
NA,armarked contrast the very poor decision of,57
NA,inthe Government in a previous year in remov-,57
NA,But ing the Australian contingent to the multi-,57
NA,national force in the Sinai. I think there is a,57
NA,great deal to be gained for serving men in,57
NA,this the Australian armed forces to have some,57
NA,experience. Whilst there is very real,57
NA,"involved, particularly in regard to the",57
NA,"current decision, I think it does provide op-",57
NA,portunities for Australian defence personnel,57
NA,to experience conditions outside Australia,57
NA,and to put their training to a very real test.,57
NA,"As I have said, I do not think for a moment",57
NA,that the Australian troops involved will not,57
NA,discharge their duties in the highest tradi-,57
NA,of the Australian Services and forces,57
NA,those obligations over the years.,57
NA,There are some things that worry me about,57
NA,the decision. I remember when 10 years ago,57
NA,the Government of the day was discussing a,57
NA,before it came to a decision. A report,57
NA,"in the Canberra Times of 16 January 1979,",57
NA,"when the decision was being canvassed, said:",57
NA,The Government at this stage has been warned that,57
NA,Army is too thinly spread to carry out the duties,57
NA,with which it is charged with as well as mount major,57
NA,overseas commitments even of a passive kind.,57
NA,"If that was the case in 1979, how much more",57
NA,so is it the case today? We all know of the,57
NA,parlous situation in relation to the retention,57
NA,of trained Service personnel within the armed,57
NA,forces in Australia. I note the number of,57
NA,people who are going to be involved in this,57
NA,exercise in Namibia. According to the Prime,58
NA,Minister's speech:,58
NA,This is a very large and important commitment for,58
NA,"Australia, comprising almost half-",58
NA,almost half-,58
NA,of the Army's construction engineering capability.,58
NA,"Careful planning, including the use of Reservists,",58
NA,been required to ensure that high-priority engineering,58
NA,tasks closer to home can still be performed.,58
NA,I hope he is correct. I very much doubt it. I,58
NA,do not think we can truthfully say that al-,58
NA,though we will allocate almost half of the,58
NA,Australian Army's construction and engi-,58
NA,neering capability to an overseas commit-,58
NA,"ment, particularly one in Namibia, which is",58
NA,"quite a long way away, we can at the same",58
NA,time say that we are in a position to carry,58
NA,"out, and we will carry out, those tasks which",58
NA,confront us both in Australia and in our,58
NA,more immediate environs. I think that is a,58
NA,"very pious hope, and I would like to see it",58
NA,more carefully analysed. I think it points out,58
NA,once again the condition with which the,58
NA,Australian defence forces find themselves,58
NA,confronted under the continuing policies of,58
NA,this Government. The Prime Minister said,58
NA,he was pleased:,58
NA,- . . that it has been possible to minimise the,58
NA,impact of the deployment on support to the opera-,58
NA,"tional deployment force, exercise Kangaroo 89, and",58
NA,the defence cooperation program in the South,58
NA,Pacific ...,58
NA,This was reiterated by the Minister for Def-,58
NA,ence ( Mr Beazley) in his contribution to this,58
NA,debate. Again I say that on the sheer facts,58
NA,of the situation it really does leave us very,58
NA,"thin on the ground, particularly in this most",58
NA,important area of the engineering and con-,58
NA,struction capability of the Services. I make,58
NA,that comment again mindful of the fact that,58
NA,the region in which we live is not as stable,58
NA,"as was the case in the past, and certainly is",58
NA,not as stable as we would like to see it.,58
NA,"There have been situations in recent years,",58
NA,"which we can all bring to mind instantly,",58
NA,which have confronted Australia with some,58
NA,"questions which so far, thank goodness, have",58
NA,not required us to mobilise the defence forces,58
NA,in any significant way. But given the sit-,58
NA,uation in the South Pacific and in areas to,58
NA,"our north, it is not impossible to envisage a",58
NA,situation which would require the Australian,58
NA,defence forces to be utilised in a greater,58
NA,capacity than has been the case in recent,58
NA,years.,58
NA,I have already mentioned the fact that,58
NA,almost half of our engineering capacity and,58
NA,capability is going to be involved in this,58
NA,"exercise in Namibia, and that makes me really",58
NA,concerned about the continuing policy which,58
NA,has this Government is going to direct towards,58
NA,the Australian defence forces. I support the,58
NA,commitment of these troops. I think the fact,58
NA,that we have made this commitment really,58
NA,should concentrate the minds of the mem-,58
NA,bers of the Government in relation to its,58
NA,"defence policies generally, so that we can",58
NA,look to have a Defence Force capability,58
NA,which is properly aligned with the potential,58
NA,responsibilities which it may be required to,58
NA,fulfil in our own area.,58
NA,There are some other aspects of the deci-,58
NA,sion which have been touched on by my,58
NA,colleagues. I particularly mention the follow-,58
NA,ing words of the Prime Minister:,58
NA,The Government has also ensured that members,58
NA,of the Australian contingent be adequately compen-,58
NA,sated for the hardships and dangers they will face,58
NA,through a comprehensive and generous set of condi-,58
NA,"tions of service, including the payment of special",58
NA,allowances.,58
NA,"Naturally enough, I support that. He",58
NA,continued:,58
NA,"In addition, the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) will be",58
NA,seeking an amendment to the Income Tax Assess-,58
NA,ment Act to exempt the pay and allowances earned,58
NA,by Defence Force personnel while they are on tour,58
NA,with UNTAG. Repatriation benefits appropriate to,58
NA,the tasks and hazards encountered will also be,58
NA,provided.,58
NA,In providing those benefits-which I sup-,58
NA,port-I hope that other service personnel,58
NA,who have served in previous commitments,58
NA,will not' be overlooked. It would be most,58
NA,unfair if Defence Force personIlel who have,58
NA,served Australia with distinction in previous,58
NA,times were disadvantaged in relation to the,58
NA,special benefits which appear to be going to,58
NA,be made for these service personnel going to,58
NA,Namibia.,58
NA,"Overall, as we have heard, the forces in-",58
NA,volved will be facing a most serious task. It,58
NA,will not be a holiday experience for them.,58
NA,They will be going to play a most significant,58
NA,"role in, amongst other things, mine clearing.",58
NA,Anybody who has the slightest comprehen-,58
NA,sion of the difficulties and dangers involved,58
NA,in that sort of exercise will understand,59
NA,the troops will face very real dangers.,59
NA,situation in the area to which they are being,59
NA,sent is an unstable· one. These servicemen,59
NA,will face real dangers. They will playa most,59
NA,significant role in the overall combination,59
NA,which is being put together by the United,59
NA,Nations. Their tasks will be highly signifiincome,59
NA,"cant. I, along with all member of the",59
NA,"sition, wish them well in the confident belief",59
NA,that they will maintain the very highest,59
NA,ditions of Australian Defence Force personand,59
NA,nel serving overseas.,59
Mr STEELE HALL ,Boothby) (6.12)-1,59
NA,support the proposition to commit Austrament,59
NA,lian troops to Namibia for peacekeeping pursmaller,59
NA,poses with mixed feelings. It is not a problem,59
NA,area of Australia's making. It involves the,59
NA,settlement of wars caused through other,59
NA,people's interests. Certainly I support the,59
NA,remarks that have been made here today in,59
NA,drawing to the attention of the Minister for,59
NA,Defence ( Mr Beazley) and the Government,59
NA,the fact that the lives and the welfare of,59
NA,Australia's contingent should be protected,59
NA,wherever possible. The cause is worthwhile,59
NA,because world politics have altered so much.,59
NA,We have now seen the retreat of those,59
NA,ments which have been supported by Ruswent,59
NA,sian interests around the world-a retreat,59
NA,from interfering by force and by the supply,59
NA,of arms from outside countries. I have,59
NA,doubt that it is the current agreements which,59
NA,have obviously been made-quietly at times,59
NA,and sometimes publicly-which have led,59
NA,this opportunity in Namibia.,59
NA,So Australia can join in this initiative,59
NA,knowing that it is not simply a one-off situthe,59
NA,ation in the sense of this country in isolation,59
NA,being involved in preparations for demohas,59
NA,cratic government arising out of a great deal,59
NA,"of internal turmoil and warfare but, rather,",59
NA,that it is part of a move around the world,59
NA,to establish order in place of the anarchy,59
NA,and armed conflict that has been occurring.,59
NA,Australians can feel pleased indeed that,59
NA,"is taking place in their own hemisphere,",59
NA,"Southern Hemisphere, in a continent that",59
NA,may be far removed from us but which,59
NA,important to us.,59
NA,"In the early part of last year, I made",59
NA,"very short visit to Namibia, involving one",59
NA,day and one night at Windhoek. Whilst,59
NA,"was short, it enabled me to form a few",59
NA,"that conclusions, some of which I believe may",59
NA,The have been right. But the major conclusion,59
NA,"which I formed was very wrong. Windhoek,",59
NA,"the capital of Namibia, is a modern city with",59
NA,"modern amenities, which is able to support",59
NA,its society and which has a very good stand-,59
NA,ard of living for those who enjoy a good,59
NA,and a good lifestyle in Namibia. I,59
NA,Opporemember going to the museum of natural,59
NA,history and being amazed at the extent to,59
NA,trawhich it showed the history of the peoples,59
NA,the geographic development of that,59
NA,country.,59
NA,The contrasts were extreme. Their Parlia-,59
NA,House is a modern building-much,59
NA,than this but of no less quality. It,59
NA,was quite amazing to view the galleries and,59
NA,"the lobbies of that Parliament House, con-",59
NA,structed with so many adornments of local,59
NA,"art, with magnificent murals of the animals",59
NA,that migrate across the plains of Namibia.,59
NA,That contrasted so much to the armed forces,59
NA,which are so evident in the streets of Wind-,59
NA,"hoek. They were there in force, moving about",59
NA,"in their sixes and dozens, obviously on the",59
NA,way to the war somewhere in the north of,59
NA,that country or in Angola. South African,59
NA,eletroops were very evident indeed. When we,59
NA,"into, say, a paper shop-there are very",59
NA,modern shops in that city-we were frisked,59
NA,at the door for arms. Yet what a normal,59
NA,"no scene it was in the local pet shop, where",59
NA,Australian cockatiels were for sale at 26 rand,59
NA,a pair. It is a city of contrasts which no,59
NA,to doubt would have extended further if one,59
NA,had time to look at life in Namibia.,59
NA,"The conclusion I made, after looking at",59
NA,facilities there and the obviously very,59
NA,high quality infrastructure that South Africa,59
NA,built there-in the form of public build-,59
NA,"ings, transportation and the development of",59
NA,"agriculture, dry though the country may be",59
NA,by current standards-was that South Africa,59
NA,would not get out; that it would not allow,59
NA,Namibia its freedom. I made that conclusion,59
NA,this last June and within a few months I was,59
NA,the proven very wrong indeed. South Africa has,59
NA,now agreed to negotiations to establish par-,59
NA,is liamentary democracy in that country.,59
NA,I guess that what has caught so many of,59
NA,a us by surprise-perhaps even South Africa,59
NA,itself-has been the obviously open or tacit,59
NA,it agreements reached between the two major,59
NA,power groups in the world. The different.,59
NA,"attitude of the comml:'nist world, -s. it is",60
NA,being squeezed economlCall- t- a pO-ItIO';l of,60
NA,some reality in regard to Its IntrusIon Into,60
NA,"other parts of the world, into outside spheres",60
NA,"of influence, has led to this sort of -gree­",60
NA,ment. It is very pleasing indeed that It has,60
NA,"occurred. If one looks at the opposing forces,",60
NA,one sees an agreement which has been ham-,60
NA,mered out of a warfare conducted by the,60
NA,left of the left in the sense of the Cuban,60
NA,"troops to the north and Angola and, in some",60
NA,"ways, the very fascist organisation of the",60
NA,South African Government. There could,60
NA,hardly be two greater extremes in the world,60
NA,"today. Therefore, one would have thought",60
NA,that their conflict would have been more,60
NA,deeply carried on into the future. But the,60
NA,greater powers that be have b-en. able t.o,60
NA,establish this agreement by negotiation. ThIs,60
NA,perhaps heralds much greater optimism for,60
NA,the world than has been warranted until,60
NA,now.,60
NA,I am very pleased to support this move,60
NA,involving Australian troops. I simply end by,60
NA,reaffirming that support by saying that I am,60
NA,sure they will be sensibly led. As has been,60
NA,"stated here today, I hope they are led with",60
NA,a view to preserving their welfare. I would,60
NA,not want to see Australian troops injured or,60
NA,"killed while involved in someone else's war,",60
NA,a war that has not been constructed by or,60
NA,contributed to by Australia. If that manage-,60
NA,"ment of our troops involved is maintained, I",60
NA,hope that the great prestige -hich they en-oy,60
NA,in the world and their capacIty as AustralIan,60
NA,service people to perform will be matched,60
NA,by a sensible oversight of their activities to,60
NA,the degree that their welfare is safeguarded,60
NA,so that they can return home to Australian,60
NA,soil.,60
Mr HALVERSON ,Casey) (6.l9)-Be-,60
NA,"fore beginning my speech, I warmly endorse",60
NA,the comments of my colleagues the honour-,60
NA,able member for Warringah ( Mr MACKellar),60
NA,and the honourable member for Boothby,60
NA,( Mr Steele Hall) on this important topic.,60
NA,"Today, many of those speaking have .looked",60
NA,at the contribution of Australian serVIcemen,60
NA,in this rather desolate part of the world.,60
NA,What we have not really seen thus far is a,60
NA,clear indication of the background to our,60
NA,very real commitment .to -am-bia. I .thought,60
NA,it would be worth whIle In thIS cloSIng part,60
NA,of the debate examining the reasons that,60
NA,Australians are about to serve in this very,60
NA,challenging part of southern Africa.,60
NA,"Namibia, as many honourable members",60
NA,who have contributed to this debate have,60
NA,"already said, formerly known as So.uth West",60
NA,"Africa, is a vast, 824,000 squ-re kIlometres,",60
NA,"arid mineral-rich African terntory, bordered",60
NA,to the north by Angola and to the south and,60
NA,south-east by South Africa. There is a spar-,60
NA,tan population of about 1.5 million souls. It,60
NA,was first colonised by the Germans in 1884.,60
NA,In 1920 South Africa assumed control under,60
NA,a League of Nations mandate. In the years,60
NA,that followed South Africa established a,60
NA,"thorough administrative, political and eco-",60
NA,nomic dominance in the territory. When the,60
NA,much-despised apartheid system was intro-,60
NA,duced into South Africa after World War II,60
NA,it was also applied to Namibia.,60
NA,When the UN succeeded the League of,60
NA,Nations in 1945 South Africa refused to en-,60
NA,ter into a new trusteeship arrangement with,60
NA,it and since 1946 the UN and South Africa,60
NA,have been in conflict over the political status,60
NA,of the territory. As a result of South Africa's,60
NA,refusal to submit reports on its administra-,60
NA,"tion of Namibia, the 1966 session of the UN",60
NA,General Assembly resolved that South Africa,60
NA,should be stripped of its mandate in the,60
NA,territory and that responsibility should be,60
NA,vested in the UN appointed Council for Na-,60
NA,mibia. A long process of UN sponso.red de-,60
NA,bate on Namibia has continued to thIS day.,60
NA,In the 1960s South Africa moved to con-,60
NA,solidate its control in the territory and the,60
NA,"provisions of apartheid, notably in the .area",60
NA,of severely limiting indigenous people's nghts,60
NA,"in landholding, were intensified. In October",60
NA,"1966 the predominant nationalist movement,",60
NA,the South West Africa People's Organisation,60
NA,"(SWAPO), launched a guerilla war against",60
NA,the South African military presence. Exten-,60
NA,sive armed conflict has continued ever since.,60
NA,The UN has made intensive efforts to at-,60
NA,tempt to achieve the peaceful solution of the,60
NA,Namibian issue leading to independence for,60
NA,the territory. South Africa partic.ipat-d in a,60
NA,"series of talks with the UN, whIle SImulta-",60
NA,neously attempting to maximise its control,60
NA,in the territory and moving to develop an,60
NA,elected political structure within Namibia.,60
NA,The attainment of black majority rule in,60
NA,Angola and Mozambique in 1975 and in,60
NA,Zimbabwe in 1980 placed further pressure,61
NA,on the South Africans. In 1978 efforts by the,61
NA,Western members of the Security Council to,61
NA,reconcile the protagonists in the dispute over,61
NA,Namibia led to the adoption of Security,61
NA,Council Resolution 435. It provided for a,61
NA,"cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of South",61
NA,African troops and free elections supervised,61
NA,by the military and civilian United Nations,61
NA,"Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG),",61
NA,the aim of which was independence for Na-,61
NA,mibia. Australia has offered to contribute,61
NA,troops and UNTAG peacekeeping forces for,61
NA,more than 10 years. In December 1986 Aus-,61
NA,tralia announced that from 1986-87 $lm per,61
NA,annum would be spent on scholarships for,61
NA,African refugees from South Africa and Na-,61
NA,mibia. In May 1987 sanctions applied to,61
NA,South Africa were extended to Namibia. In,61
NA,August 1985 the Australian Prime Minister,61
NA,( Mr Hawke) asserted that the need for Na-,61
NA,mibian settlement remains as strong as ever;,61
NA,"only the urgency has increased. Indeed, by",61
NA,"August 1986 some 12,000 Namibians had",61
NA,been killed in the 20 years war of,61
NA,independence.,61
NA,In mid-June 1985 South African attempts,61
NA,to achieve an internal solution were greatly,61
NA,advanced by the establishment of an interim,61
NA,"government, the Transitional Government of",61
NA,National Unity (TGNU) in Namibia based,61
NA,"on the multi-party conference (MPC) , a",61
NA,group of internal parties which does not in-,61
NA,clude SWAPO. This move met with wide-,61
NA,spread international condemnation. The UN,61
NA,"Security Council passed Resolution 566, to-",61
NA,"tally rejecting this internal solution, and",61
NA,Secretary-General issued a statement con-,61
NA,demning the move as a further obstacle in,61
NA,the path of a negotiated settlement in,61
NA,"Namibia. The 1987 report, however, indi-",61
NA,cated that the MPC TGNU was not as pliant,61
NA,as South Africa would like it to be and that,61
NA,it was declining to set up the ethnically,61
NA,system of electorates which would ensure a,61
NA,"weak and divided successor state, easily",61
NA,manipulated by South Africa. The TGNU,61
NA,was aiming for a nationwide vote for an,61
NA,assembly which would run the country and,61
NA,draft a constitution.,61
NA,In April 1988 South Africa's President de-,61
NA,cided to reassert South Africa's authority in,61
NA,"Namibia. President Botha gave Louis Pienaar,",61
NA,"the South African appointed administrator,",61
NA,"the right to overrule the Cabinet, call ra-",61
NA,cially based elections for each of the region's,61
NA,"11 ethnic groups, and impose sweeping press",61
NA,censorship laws. The most important aspect,61
NA,of this development was that the administra-,61
NA,tor had the power to veto any move to,61
NA,"repeal Proclamation AG8, a key piece of",61
NA,apartheid legislation that entrenches white,61
NA,social and economic privilege. By being un-,61
NA,"able to remove apartheid, the TGNU has",61
NA,lost virtually all hope of ever gaining any,61
NA,popular support.,61
NA,"Meanwhile, diplomacy continued. In July",61
NA,1986 a special UN conference on Namibia,61
NA,"was held in Vienna, attended by representa-",61
NA,"tives of 128 governments. Their decisions,",61
NA,including a demand for comprehensive sanc-,61
NA,tions against South Africa to force it to grant,61
NA,"independence, were endorsed by UN special",61
NA,session later in the year. In April 1987 the,61
NA,UN Security Council discussed Namibia for,61
NA,four days. Until August 1988 10 years of,61
NA,extensive negotiations had failed to resolve,61
NA,"the dispute, which had been complicated by",61
NA,South African insistence on linking the with-,61
NA,drawal of its forces from Namibia with a,61
NA,withdrawal of the Cuban presence in Angola.,61
NA,"However, on 8 August 1988 Cuba, Angola",61
NA,"and South Africa, with American mediation,",61
NA,agreed to a 14-point accord.,61
NA,. The main features of the agreement are,61
NA,an immediate ceasefire between on the one,61
NA,hand the armed forces of Cuba and Angola,61
NA,and on the other the South African Army;,61
NA,South African troop withdrawal from An-,61
NA,gola by August 1988-and this deadline was,61
NA,the met; the establishment of a joint military,61
NA,committee composed of military officers from,61
NA,"Angola, Cuba, South Africa and Namibia to",61
NA,monitor the withdrawal of South African,61
NA,troops from Angola; to recommend to the,61
NA,Secretary-General of the UN the date 1,61
NA,November 1988 for the beginning of imple-,61
NA,based mentation of UN Security Council Resolu-,61
NA,"tion 435; the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops",61
NA,based in Angola will withdraw from the ter-,61
NA,"ritory; the 7,500-man UN force to be sent to",61
NA,Namibia by 1 April 1989-some months be-,61
NA,fore the elections are due to be held; a policy,61
NA,of non-intervention in neighbouring territo-,61
NA,ries; South Africa stops assisting the National,61
NA,Union for the Total Independence of Angola,61
NA,(UNIT A); and Angola stops providing as-,61
NA,sistance to SWAPO and the African Na-,61
NA,tional Congress (ANC)-and presumably this,62
NA,also means that an independent Namibia,62
NA,would not permit ANC guerillas to operate,62
NA,out of its territories.,62
NA,The House' can see that the extensive,62
NA,efforts of many people have contributed over,62
NA,many years to what now looks like being a,62
NA,solution to a problem that has plagued the,62
NA,world for many years. We now see Austra-,62
NA,"lian troops-in fact, about half of the en-",62
NA,gineering component of our Army-being,62
NA,dep-oyed to this very challenging and hostile,62
NA,environment. These troops will be involved,62
NA,"!n the. building of roads and airfields, repair-",62
NA,"mg bndges, constructing buildings and forti-",62
NA,"fications, removing minefields and setting up",62
NA,"watch towers, water and sewerage systems.",62
NA,They will be led by Colonel Richard Warren,62
NA,and represent the cream of Australian def-,62
NA,ence manpower. It behoves us all on both,62
NA,sid- of this Parliament to support this op-,62
NA,eration with great will. It is a dangerous and,62
NA,"as 1 say, hostile environment. Australian sol-",62
NA,-iers will almost certainly be killed there. It,62
NA,IS appropriate on this night for Australians,62
NA,throughout this country to recognise the,62
NA,challenges that are in store for our troops. 1,62
NA,only hope that the Government in its wis-,62
NA,"dom, deciding to deploy these troops there",62
NA,recognises the enormous challenges that it,62
NA,has set u- and 1 trust that the logistic sup-,62
NA,port that IS so necessary to provide such an,62
NA,operational component so far away with its,62

NA,"Debate resumed from 2 March, on motion",62
NA,by Mr Staples:,62
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,62
NA,upon which Mr Braithwaite had moved by,62

NA,(2) expresses its concern at the diminishing mo-,62
NA,rale of the providers of services to the aged,62
NA,because of various Government initiatives,62
NA,particularly the commissioning of the report,62
NA,I'm Still an Individual'.,62
NA,NA,62
NA,my remarks by giving a brief recapitulation,62
NA,of the points 1 made in the chamber last,62
NA,week in reference to the Aged or Disabled,62
NA,Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988. The,62
NA,Bill seeks to introduce a number of changes,62
NA,covering a broad spectrum and concerns the,62
NA,industry which provides essential care and,62
NA,support for the aged and disabled in society.,62
NA,To use the words of the director of one such,62
NA,"institution in my electorate, the Hawke Gov-",62
NA,-rnment is being politically dishonest in say-,62
NA,"109 that by 1990 no-one will be required, by",62
NA,"law, .to pay more than 87.5 per cent of the",62
NA,pensIOn and supplementary assistance for ac-,62
NA,commodation in nursing homes. The effect,62
NA,of this 87.5 per cent ceiling will undoubtedly,62
NA,be -o heap massive pressure on the industry,62
NA,as It attempts to continue to provide an,62
NA,acceptable level of service to the patients in,62
NA,"its care, as prices rise and a lid is put on its",62
NA,charges. 1 point out that not all people are,62
NA,"financially disabled and, for years, the",62
NA,"wealthy have, to some degree, subsidised the",62
NA,less well off.,62
NA,The consequences of instituting a ceiling,62
NA,"on th- charges of nursing homes will be, of",62
NA,"necessity, that homes concentrate on caring",62
NA,"for patients in categories 1, 2 and 3, which",62
NA,"attr-ct the highest level of subsidy, to the",62
NA,detnment of those in categories 4 and 5.,62
NA,Dementia patients are deemed to be in cat-,62
NA,egories 4 and 5-those needing the least,62
NA,amount of care-but dementia patients can,62
NA,often keep staff fully occupied with the tasks,62
NA,"?f fe-ding, toileting and dealing with",62
NA,lOcontmence.,62
NA,If a nursing home's budget is restricted by,62
NA,the type of patients it has and the amount it,62
NA,"can charge, the only way to overcome the",62
NA,shortfall is to decrease the level of service.,62
NA,That is precisely the situation that leads to,62
NA,"-he neglect of an individual's dignity, such as",62
NA,m the case of communal clothing. Dementia,62
NA,"or not, people should not need to suffer",62
NA,neglect. Another aspect of the same point is:,62
NA,-ha- about the staff? By pressuring the in-,62
NA,s-ltution the staff have that pressure passed,62
NA,directly on to them. They have to work in,62
NA,an environment where they never have time,63
NA,"to do the job well, and are never able to",63
NA,have the satisfaction of making a patient,63
NA,comfortable and happy because they are too,63
NA,busy jumping from crisis to crisis and serv-,63
NA,icing only the most fundamental needs. I can,63
NA,"see two crises looming: firstly, a situation in",63
NA,which patients in categories 4 and 5 will only,63
NA,"be accepted in voluntary institutions, which",63
NA,will then become overloaded and under-,63
NA,"financed; and, secondly, a staff shortage",63
NA,throughout the industry.,63
NA,There is a tremendous amount of debate,63
NA,about the Government's declared decision to,63
NA,cut total nursing home beds to a level of 40,63
NA,per hundred of the population aged over 70.,63
NA,"In 1987 there were an estimated 167,000",63
NA,"people aged 65-plus in South Australia, mak-",63
NA,ing up 12 per cent of the State's total pop-,63
NA,ulation. By the year 2021 it is predicted that,63
NA,that group will represent 17.3 per cent of,63
NA,"the population. Further, by that time there",63
NA,"will be an estimated 22,800 people in South",63
NA,"Australia aged 85-phis, compared with 13,222",63
NA,"in 1987, an increase of 72 per cent in that",63
NA,short timespan. That dramatic change must,63
NA,indicate something to everyone who is con-,63
NA,cerned with planning aged services and resi-,63
NA,dential care.,63
NA,At the moment in South Australia there,63
NA,"are 7,700 aged persons in 160 nursing homes",63
NA,"and about 5,740 aged persons in 125 hostels.",63
NA,Half the nursing home residents are aged 85,63
NA,years and over. If bed occupancy in nursing,63
NA,homes in the year 2001 corresponds with the,63
NA,"present aged percentage, that same percent-",63
NA,age of people aged 85 and over will be,63
NA,"looking for 6,622 beds. The present overall",63
NA,"number of nursing home beds is 7,700. If no",63
NA,more beds are available in South Australia,63
NA,by the year 2001-and the Government is,63
NA,indicating in this legislation that it intends,63
NA,decrease them-that will leave only 78 beds,63
NA,available to people under the age of 85.,63
NA,What does the Government want people to,63
NA,do-take it in turns to sleep?,63
NA,This is only one example of the inade-,63
NA,quacy of the Government's thinking on the,63
NA,subject of planning for the future with re-,63
NA,gard to adequately providing a broad range,63
NA,of options in the interests of the aged in our,63
NA,community. There is no doubt that the pri-,63
NA,vate sector will feel the pinch severely. It,63
NA,will be the voluntary sector which will be,63
NA,left to pick up and care for categories 4 and,63
NA,5 patients that the private sector may feel it,63
NA,has to pass over in order to better survive,63
NA,"by filling its beds with the categories 1, 2",63
NA,and 3 patients that attract a higher subsidy.,63
NA,Where is the Government's logic in trying to,63
NA,"cut costs by limiting resources, then turning",63
NA,around and boasting that by 1990 no person,63
NA,"in a nursing home, regardless of tQe personal",63
NA,"resources at his disposal, will have to pay",63
NA,more than 87.5 per cent of the pension for,63
NA,accommodation in a nursing home? On the,63
NA,other side of the problem there are the hos-,63
NA,tels. I received a letter from the Administra-,63
NA,tor of the Churches of Christ Retirement,63
NA,Services Inc. in my electorate. He said:,63
NA,The haste with which the Hostel Recurrent Fund-,63
NA,ing agreement has been brought forward is typical of,63
NA,other changes we have had to cope with in the aged,63
NA,care industry.,63
NA,I am not sure if the problem lies with the Minister,63
NA,"or the Public Service. However, we have been told",63
NA,in no uncertain terms that failure to sign or changing,63
NA,the Agreement will put our subsidies at risk.,63
NA,Of particular concern in this climate is that the,63
NA,"Minister can change the conditions, and the thought",63
NA,of the consultation process only reminds that it has,63
NA,been a sham in the past . . .,63
NA,You will notice my criticism that the Disabled,63
NA,Code is now to apply fully. This condition was,63
NA,changed without consultation.,63
NA,The upshot is that nearly every hostel for the aged,63
NA,in Australia no longer complies with the require-,63
NA,ments. This must be the height of stupidity since we,63
NA,have previously built for the aged and had no,63
NA,troubles.,63
NA,It now seems that the Government is saying that,63
NA,"since some aged people are disabled, all should be",63
NA,treated as disabled.,63
NA,"Perhaps they should have said that, for example,",63
NA,5% of the units should be for the dis-,63
NA,"abled . . . but they didn't,",63
NA,He has been told that such a requirement,63
NA,to would have been received far more favoura-,63
NA,"bly, especially as a prospective condition for",63
NA,new buildings. The Administrator says he,63
NA,feels that the trouble lies in the central office,63
NA,"in Canberra, where unrealistic goals and",63
NA,deadlines are being set and pursued to the,63
NA,embarrassment of local staff. The Adminis-,63
NA,trator has made it clear to the department,63
NA,concerned that he signed the agreement un-,63
NA,der extreme protest. Australians must be,63
NA,"concerned about being heavied, bullied or",63
NA,blackmailed. He makes the point that by far,63
NA,the majority of the hostels for the aged in,63
NA,"Australia have been designed for the aged,",64
NA,not the disabled. A requirement to provide,64
NA,for the disabled aged by expecting a propor-,64
NA,tion of rooms in a complex to be so designed,64
NA,seems more reasonable than presuming all,64
NA,aged people are disabled. Short of bulldozing,64
NA,the Churches of Christ Retirement Services',64
NA,145 hostels and rebuilding-and at what,64
NA,cost-the organisation cannot comply with,64
NA,the requirement. The Administrator makes it,64
NA,quite clear that he feels the Government is,64
NA,over-regulating the industry. That is the issue.,64
NA,I have said that there are many good as-,64
NA,pects of the legislation before us. The major-,64
NA,ity of the nursing home and hostel industry,64
NA,is keen to see old people retain their individ-,64
NA,"uality and dignity. However, that which is",64
NA,not specified in the legislation and is being,64
NA,left to either regulation or interpretation by,64
NA,the Minister or the Public Service is already,64
NA,causing deep concern within the industry as,64
NA,several significant problems 100m large on,64
NA,"the horizon. This legislation, in the form",64
NA,"presented to the· House, is not the panacea",64
NA,it pretends to be.,64
NA,I conclude with this warning: those ap-,64
NA,proaching consumer status should be deeply,64
NA,concerned about the future of this industry;,64
NA,otherwise they may find that what they need,64
NA,may not be there when they need it.,64
Ms CRAWFORD ,Forde) (8.09)-Many,64
NA,speakers have addressed the Aged or Dis-,64
NA,"abled Persons Homes Amendment Bill, which",64
NA,seeks to amend the 1954 Act. The Bill at-,64
NA,tempts to pursue a policy which gives this,64
NA,Government a total aged care policy and,64
NA,will provide for an extended range of care,64
NA,"options to meet individual needs. Surely, no-",64
NA,"one in our community would suggest that, as",64
NA,"we as a community become more aged,",64
NA,people should not be treated as individuals.,64
NA,This is precisely what the Bill seeks to do. It,64
NA,"seeks to do it in a number of ways, but",64
NA,particularly through the funding program.,64
NA,What we see in this funding program is an,64
NA,arrangement whereby people are looked at,64
NA,in categories and whereby their needs are,64
NA,met. It attempts not simply to categorise,64
NA,"people into one set of nursing home people,",64
NA,"one set of hostel people, or one set of people",64
NA,"in individual programs, but rather it looks at",64
NA,the whole basis of the kind of services which,64
NA,are provided. It attempts to address the in-,64
NA,consistencies which are currently in the pro-,64
NA,posals for the funding of nursing homes and,64
NA,hostels. It attempts to seek that out. It also,64
NA,attempts to provide quality care for all aged,64
NA,"citizens within our community, irrespective",64
NA,"of their financial situation and, hopefully,",64
NA,irrespective of where they live and who the,64
NA,care providers are.,64
NA,All of us can cite many examples of a,64
NA,wide range of care that is available to the,64
NA,aged people in our community. It is impera-,64
NA,"tive that, if we are to address the care of the",64
NA,"aged within our community in a total way,",64
NA,"we acknowledge, firstly, that they are indi-",64
NA,"viduals and, secondly, that people have needs",64
NA,and that these needs must be addressed in a,64
NA,legislative way. Many of the care providers,64
NA,feel threatened because they are not willing,64
NA,to be flexible enough to offer changes. How-,64
NA,"ever, there are many good care providers",64
NA,within our community who see and welcome,64
NA,this Bill as an attempt to address the situa-,64
NA,tion realistically.,64
NA,I am interested to hear the honourable,64
NA,NA,64
NA,putting on a ceiling of 87t per cent of the,64
NA,pensions of those people in aged care will,64
NA,place great pressure on the industry. One is,64
NA,forced to ask: What does he view as a real-,64
NA,istic figure for people to pay for their care,64
NA,"and needs? After all, this is subsidised by",64
NA,"government and is subsidised by taxpayers,",64
NA,and all of us must share the common respon-,64
NA,sibility of the care for the aged. A figure of,64
NA,87t per cent of pensions equalises the burden,64
NA,and sets a realistic figure and goal so that,64
NA,people will not be ripped off. Let us face it;,64
NA,some of the findings in our earlier nursing,64
NA,home review found that many people were,64
NA,being charged for services they were not,64
NA,receiving and that they were being over-,64
NA,charged for services which were very often,64
NA,of a very poor quality.,64
NA,When I talk of quality I am always forced,64
NA,to look at a nursing home within my own,64
NA,"electorate which is known as Canossa, which",64
NA,provides a very wide range of services. It,64
NA,exemplifies the kind of service and the qual-,64
NA,ity of service which this Bill hopes to emu-,64
NA,"late for all Australians. The Canossa Hospital,",64
NA,which is run by the Canossan Sisters of,64
NA,"Charity, provides hostel accommodation,",64
NA,"nursing accommodation, and specific accom-",64
NA,modation for Italian speaking people in our,64
NA,community who in their later years find that,64
NA,"they like to have things familiar, and lingu-",65
NA,"istically familiar, around them. It also pro-",65
NA,"vides respite care within its walls and, of",65
NA,"course, it has a very active residents associ-",65
NA,ation. People are treated as individuals and,65
NA,the care providers in this home have no,65
NA,"difficulty with the funding arrangements, with",65
NA,"the quality care that is expected, and with",65
NA,"the 87t per cent which they currently charge,",65
NA,which is welcomed because they understand,65
NA,"fairness, justice and equity for all aged",65
NA,in our community.,65
NA,The residents reflect that individuality.,65
NA,Those who are mobile are often seen down,65
NA,the street. Those who are not are provided,65
NA,with buses or taxis and with means of going,65
NA,places. At a number of functions which I,65
NA,have had in my electorate the residents from,65
NA,this particular hostel and nursing home stand,65
NA,"out because they are individuals, because they",65
NA,"are prepared to stand up and be counted,",65
NA,and because they have not lost any of those,65
NA,great attributes that we admire in people,65
NA,irrespective of age. Surely if we are to offer,65
NA,"people dignity in their later years we cannot,",65
NA,"and We must not, forget that they are indi-",65
NA,viduals. I find it extraordinary that people,65
NA,would suggest that the Chris Ronalds report,65
NA,"I'm Still an Individual, which this legislation",65
NA,"takes into consideration, is in any way a",65
NA,reflection on the care that is provided in,65
NA,some homes. If people find it a reflection on,65
NA,"them, all I can say is that they are obviously",65
NA,breaching individual binds. I can cite a num-,65
NA,"ber of examples, which I will not do here,",65
NA,but I think we are all aware of certain homes,65
NA,"where any sense of dignity, any sense of",65
NA,"individuality, is taken away and where people",65
NA,are ruled by fear-fear that if they do not,65
NA,conform they will be thrown out on the,65
NA,"street, fear that if they do not do as they are",65
NA,told they will be thrown out on the street.,65
NA,We are talking about adult people who have,65
NA,given very much of their lives to this country,65
NA,"and here they are in their later years, when",65
NA,"they should be surrounded by comforts, when",65
NA,"there should be a degree of respect, in places",65
NA,where some care providers insist that they,65
NA,conform to what they consider to be the,65
NA,necessary mores. I am very pleased that Chris,65
NA,"Ronalds and her review team, as part of this",65
NA,Bill and as part of our total aged care pack-,65
NA,"age, are embarking upon an education and",65
NA,information program throughout our com-,65
NA,"munity, and are offering to nursing home",65
NA,"residents, to hostel residents and to others",65
NA,"the acknowledgment that they have rights,",65
NA,"that they have dignity, and with that, of",65
NA,"course, responsibility to themselves.",65
NA,"Of course, it is not only they who have",65
NA,responsibility; the care providers also have,65
NA,"responsibility. This Bill, by seeking to look",65
NA,at the way in which care providers spend,65
NA,"their money, attempts to make people re-",65
NA,people sponsible. I am sure that nobody in this,65
NA,House would suggest that we as the Govern-,65
NA,ment can continue to give money to people,65
NA,and not find them accountable. It is surely a,65
NA,matter of concern to us that if we give,65
NA,money to hostels and to nursing homes they,65
NA,must give the kind of services for which the,65
NA,money is given.,65
NA,Earlier I heard the honourable member,65
NA,for Adelaide talk about dementia patients.,65
NA,The honourable member for Adelaide per-,65
NA,haps is unaware of a very large program that,65
NA,is already operating under the nursing home,65
NA,and aged care program which specifically,65
NA,targets dementia patients. In my own elec-,65
NA,"torate at Neilson Home, Matron Buxton runs",65
NA,an excellent program for dementia patients.,65
NA,Those people are treated as individuals and,65
NA,the quality of their life has been expanded.,65
NA,It has enabled people to develop and to live,65
NA,a more worthwhile existence within that,65
NA,nursing home. It is indicative of the kind of,65
NA,range of services one can offer if one is more,65
NA,flexible about funding-which is exactly what,65
NA,this Bill is about. It is not about care provi-,65
NA,ders saying that there is one way of doing,65
NA,things. There is never one way of doing,65
NA,things for individuals. There is a whole range,65
NA,"of ways, all of which are equally valid, in",65
NA,the same way that the categories set out that,65
NA,there is a range of needs and a range of,65
NA,services which have to be provided within,65
NA,that community.,65
NA,I have cited one hostel and nursing home,65
NA,which offers a wide range of services within,65
NA,the electorate. There are also other nursing,65
NA,homes which offer different kinds of services,65
NA,"and which, because of the nature of their",65
NA,"clients and the nature of their residents, tend",65
NA,to be much less able to expand into the,65
NA,community but are able to bring the com-,65
NA,munity into them. Many school children are,65
NA,involved in nursing homes. I am thinking in,65
NA,"particular of Sinnamon Retirement Village,",65
NA,where the local school children have an,66
NA,'adopt a granny' program. They go into the,66
NA,nursing home and are very much part of,66
NA,that community.,66
NA,This is all able to be funded. It is part of,66
NA,a total aged care package. It is all part of a,66
NA,quality of life. It is all part of a quality,66
NA,program. This is not to say that this is the,66
NA,"only way this should occur, but under this",66
NA,Bill such programs can and will be ex-,66
NA,panded. Individuals who wish to participate,66
NA,in such programs will be able to do so. It is,66
NA,imperative that many residents in nursing,66
NA,homes have the opportunity to continue to,66
NA,feel part of a world that is considerably,66
NA,wider than the acre or so upon which their,66
NA,nursing home or hostel is built. It is this very,66
NA,issue that is at the heart of the changes to,66
NA,the aged and disabled peoples homes re-,66
NA,arrangements. It is the fact that we have,66
NA,acknowledged that aged people in our com-,66
NA,munity have demands and needs and are,66
NA,individuals. Through this Bill we will con-,66
NA,"tinue to meet those demands, to meet those",66
NA,"needs, and at a price which we can be sure",66
NA,people are accountable for and at a price,66
NA,which pensioners can afford. The whole issue,66
NA,of equity is at the heart of this Bill. I com-,66
NA,mend the Bill to the House.,66
Mr HICKS ,Riverina-Darling) (8.20)-ln,66
NA,speaking to the Aged or Disabled Persons,66
NA,Homes Amendment Bill 1988 I must once,66
NA,again express my strongest concern at the,66
NA,apparent stringent conditions being placed,66
NA,by this Federal Government on those people,66
NA,wishing to provide care for the elderly. To,66
NA,be fair may I first of all thank the Minister,66
NA,for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) for,66
NA,his courtesy in speaking with the delegation,66
NA,from the Cobar Shire Council. Over a very,66
NA,long period the people of Cobar have been,66
NA,pointing out to the appropriate authorities,66
NA,the problems that the Lilliane Brady Village,66
NA,was facing in operating a small nursing home,66
NA,in an isolated area and trying to survive,66
NA,under the Federal Government's new nurs-,66
NA,ing home funding policies. New initiatives,66
NA,have recently been taken by the Government,66
NA,in relation to these smaller nursing homes so,66
NA,I congratulate the Minister on a start in the,66
NA,right direction.,66
NA,"However, the new proposals do not over-",66
NA,come all of the problems facing small iso-,66
NA,lated nursing homes such as the Lilliane,66
NA,"Brady Village. In the first place, the new",66
NA,funding formula under the nursing and per-,66
NA,sonal care component does not adequately,66
NA,cover the salaries of the staff. In the case of,66
NA,"the Lilliane Brady Village, a director of nurs-",66
NA,ing and a deputy director of nursing must be,66
NA,provided. Because of the isolation of the,66
NA,nursing home and the relatively small popu-,66
NA,"lation of Cobar, attracting staff of exactly",66
NA,the required level of experience is difficult.,66
NA,"For example, a second year trained sister",66
NA,may be able to do the work required but the,66
NA,only sister available may be a seven-year,66
NA,"trained sister who should be, and therefore",66
NA,"has to be, paid the award wage that his or",66
NA,her experience attracts. Because the rates set,66
NA,by the Government are averaged right across,66
NA,Australia the figure arrived at is well below,66
NA,that which in practice does apply to isolated,66
NA,"nursing homes. Of course, this applies not",66
NA,only to nursing home wages but to most,66
NA,wage cost structures in isolated areas.,66
NA,The Government would have us believe,66
NA,that the flexibility of the care aggregate mod-,66
NA,"ule, or CAM, arrangements enables service",66
NA,providers to overcome a variety of problems.,66
NA,"It fails, however, to address the matters of",66
NA,"staff availability in many areas, particularly",66
NA,in isolated locations. It also fails to address,66
NA,the matter of nursing homes having to meet,66
NA,"the requirements of the outcome standards,",66
NA,"the national complaints unit, the State health",66
NA,departments and the myriad of other per-,66
NA,former indicators by which service providers,66
NA,are constantly monitored by government. As,66
NA,the quality of care deteriorates-which inev-,66
NA,itably must occur as a result of government,66
NA,funding cuts and the inability of nursing,66
NA,homes to charge patients more than 87.5 per,66
NA,cent of their pension-extra stress will be,66
NA,placed on nursing home staff. The stress on,66
NA,"nurses is going to accelerate, particularly on",66
NA,the director of nursing. As nurses find the,66
NA,professional care required to be greater than,66
NA,the number of hours allocated by the Gov-,66
NA,ernment they will turn to other forms of,66
NA,nursing outside nursing homes.,66
NA,Let us now look at another situation which,66
NA,has developed in relation to the care for the,66
NA,"aged, this time in the city of Broken Hill.",66
NA,Honourable members may recall me previ-,66
NA,ously bringing to their attention the pending,66
NA,"closure of Kalinda Court and Allura Lodge,",66
NA,which are two wards of the Broken Hill Base,66
NA,Hospital that care for elderly long stay,67
NA,patients. The New South Wales State Min-,67
NA,"ister for Health, Mr Collins, recently made",67
NA,a statement confirming the closures and re-,67
NA,peated what we all know to be true-that,67
NA,"is, that the finance for the care of those",67
NA,people is the responsibility of the Federal,67
NA,Government. He also reiterated that the hos-,67
NA,pital wards in question were beyond the stage,67
NA,of rehabilitation and should be demolished.,67
NA,Where does this leave Broken Hill's elderly,67
NA,"citizens who need care? In the first place,",67
NA,there is already a very long waiting list for,67
NA,both hostel and nursing home accommoda-,67
NA,tion. There are only two nursing homes pres-,67
NA,ently operating in Broken Hill-the,67
NA,Centenary Nursing Home and St Anne's,67
NA,Nursing Home. Both are in a parlous situa-,67
NA,tion because of costs that are unique to,67
NA,"Broken Hill and, as with the situation apply-",67
NA,"ing in Cobar, they will not be able to survive",67
NA,on a Government cost rate that is based on,67
NA,an averaging across Australia.,67
NA,It is not my intention to argue the merits,67
NA,or otherwise of the industrial system that has,67
NA,developed in Broken Hill over the years. But,67
NA,this system has certainly placed tremendous,67
NA,. pressure on the whole of the aged care sys-,67
NA,tem in that city. The New South Wales,67
NA,Nursing Association is seeking to have some,67
NA,of these conditions apply to nurses employed,67
NA,at the two Broken Hill nursing homes. They,67
NA,are seeking the payment of the Broken Hill,67
NA,allowance of $12.40 a week and the provi-,67
NA,sion of an additional one week of annual,67
NA,leave. Both of these are standard provisions,67
NA,of the Broken Hill award. This would cause,67
NA,an estimated increase in the running cost of,67
NA,both nursing homes as at 1 July 1988 of,67
NA,"approximately $60,130, or 4.21 per cent of",67
NA,the budget for 1988-89. If all conditions that,67
NA,applied to the Broken Hill Base Hospital,67
NA,staff were insisted on-and thankfully they,67
NA,are not-the position would be even worse.,67
NA,In fact when the administrators made repre-,67
NA,sentations for economic relief from the De-,67
NA,partment of Community Services and Health,67
NA,"because of these additional costs, the reply",67
NA,from the departmental representative stated,67
NA,in part:,67
NA,"I am somewhat surprised by your request, and to",67
NA,meet your request for special treatment for the,67
NA,"of Broken Hill would at the very least, require",67
NA,amendment to the National Health Act.,67
NA,So we now face the situation that not only,67
NA,are the present nursing homes facing great,67
NA,difficulty and the possibility that they may,67
NA,not be able to continue for much longer,67
NA,under the cost structure presently applying,67
NA,"in Broken Hill, but these costs, unless totally",67
NA,funded by the Federal Government or eased,67
NA,"by local industrial agreements, will ensure",67
NA,that no entrepreneur or church group will,67
NA,apply to have further nursing home beds,67
NA,allocated for Broken Hill.,67
NA,The Federal Government has expressed a,67
NA,desire to have more hostel type accommo-,67
NA,dation provided in lieu of nursing home beds.,67
NA,Presently Aruma Lodge provides a high,67
NA,standard of hostel accommodation in Broken,67
NA,Hill but many more beds are required. Be-,67
NA,"cause of this, over the past four years South-",67
NA,"ern Cross Homes, the present administrators",67
NA,"of the two nursing homes in Broken Hill,",67
NA,have applied for funding for hostel accom-,67
NA,"modation. Unfortunately, despite the long",67
NA,"waiting lists for this accommodation, they",67
NA,have been unsuccessful. I doubt if they will,67
NA,"apply again because, as the Voluntary Care",67
NA,"Association has recently pointed out, anyone",67
NA,who builds this accommodation under the,67
NA,new guidelines for funding announced by the,67
NA,Federal Government over a period of time,67
NA,would not be economically viable whether,67
NA,they were built in Broken Hill or anywhere,67
NA,"else. Therefore, the cost structures applying",67
NA,in Broken Hill would rule that accommoda-,67
NA,tion out completely unless Broken Hill were,67
NA,treated as a special case by the Federal Gov-,67
NA,ernment or special industrial conditions were,67
NA,negotiated.,67
NA,I was interested to read in the Barrier,67
NA,"Daily Truth, Broken Hill's daily newspaper,",67
NA,that the Barrier Industrial Council in Broken,67
NA,Hill has arranged a deputation to see the,67
NA,Minister for Housing and Aged Care on the,67
NA,matter of nursing homes and hostel accom-,67
NA,modation in Broken Hill. I am accustomed,67
NA,"to the Barrier Industrial Council, for reasons",67
NA,"best known to its members, ignoring me as",67
NA,the Federal Member in its applications to,67
NA,various Ministers on a range of issues. On,67
NA,this occasion I am disappointed because care,67
NA,for Broken Hill senior citizens is of universal,67
NA,concern and certainly should be approached,67
NA,homes on bipartisan lines. Perhaps I may be misin-,67
NA,an terpreting the situation. The invitation has,67
NA,"not arrived yet, but I am looking forward to",67
NA,it in the mail. Broken Hill is going to need,68
NA,a united front if it is to provide adequate,68
NA,services for its elderly citizens with the,68
NA,"and Federal conditions presently applying,",68
NA,and if we adopt a disunited front we will do,68
NA,so to the detriment of those elderly citizens.,68
NA,In 1986 the Government endorsed the,68
NA,findings of the Nursing Homes and Hostels,68
NA,Review which recognised that there was a,68
NA,need to develop a total aged care policy with,68
NA,an expanded range of care options to meet,68
NA,individual needs. The Government under-,68
NA,took to introduce a series of measures di-,68
NA,rected at the expansion and better resourcing,68
NA,"of the sector. In other words, the Govern-",68
NA,ment was going to make additional resources,68
NA,available that would enable more elderly and,68
NA,invalid people to remain in their homes. As,68
NA,"I have recently relayed to the House, I have",68
NA,not as yet seen any evidence of this financial,68
NA,"support in my electorate, and this applies",68
NA,particularly to Broken Hill.,68
NA,The concern over the matter of care for,68
NA,the elderly and infirm citizens of Broken Hill,68
NA,has become an issue of serious concern to its,68
NA,citizens and because of this great concern a,68
NA,petition has been circulated in the commu-,68
NA,nity which I am sure will be signed by most,68
NA,of the people of Broken Hill. This petition,68
NA,will in due course be presented to the,68
NA,Parliament.,68
NA,Throughout Australia there are still great,68
NA,problems existing in the provision of nursing,68
NA,home and hostel accommodation. Both Cobar,68
NA,and Broken Hill are unique cases that re-,68
NA,quire particular attention and I call on the,68
NA,Minister and the Government to take urgent,68
NA,action that will help to overcome the very,68
NA,real problems existing in those areas.,68
Mr JENKINS ,Scullin) (8.29)-The,68
NA,measures contained in the Aged or Disabled,68
NA,Persons Homes Amendment Bill 1988 are,68
NA,quite technical in nature but they are part,68
NA,of a continuing program by this Government,68
NA,to improve aged care and care for disabled,68
NA,people. As has been outlined by previous,68
NA,"speakers, this is but the fifth stage in an",68
NA,eight-stage program to improve institutional,68
NA,care for older people. That plan was an-,68
NA,nounced in 1986 and arose out of the Gov-,68
NA,ernment's response to a number of reviews,68
NA,that over the years have been well discussed,68
NA,in the community and open to great debate.,68
NA,There was first the Auditor-General's report,68
NA,"back in 1981, which was followed by an",68
NA,"local Expenditure Committee report, the MCLeay",68
NA,"report, followed by a Senate committee re-",68
NA,port known as the Giles report. Finally there,68
NA,was the Department of Community Services,68
NA,report of the nursing homes and hostels re-,68
NA,view. Much that is contained in this report,68
NA,formed the basis for the present Govern-,68
NA,ment's strategy in the area of nursing homes,68
NA,and hostels. The particular piece of legisla-,68
NA,tion before us tonight goes a long way to-,68
NA,wards putting in place the legislative,68
NA,arrangements for the provision of hostel,68
NA,"services. Importantly, it will ensure that those",68
NA,hostel services are better targeted.,68
NA,One criticism that has often been made of,68
NA,the way Australia has developed its nursing,68
NA,home and hostel services is that they have,68
NA,been planned on an ad hoc basis and that,68
NA,people and governments respond only to,68
NA,submissions that are placed before them. This,68
NA,Government has seen the error of this form,68
NA,"of action and it has decided that, as in other",68
NA,"areas, we should be doing what we can on a",68
NA,needs basis. I think even honourable mem-,68
NA,bers opposite have acknowledged the success,68
NA,with which this has been carried out.,68
NA,Another important aspect of the legisla-,68
NA,tion is that people will be assisted in having,68
NA,hostel places in the form of respite care,68
NA,made available to them. I think that respite,68
NA,"care, in providing services for the aged and",68
NA,"disabled, is an area of great importance that",68
NA,has started to be opened up. It is of impor-,68
NA,tance to the older person or the person with,68
NA,the disability and it is important to the qual-,68
NA,ity of life of a carer at home. Often because,68
NA,of the permanent nature of the funding ar-,68
NA,rangements for both nursing home and hostel,68
NA,"places, families have been prevented from",68
NA,"having some relief, some respite, from their",68
NA,"onerous duties. Now, as we see in this legis-",68
NA,lation and in previous legislation for nursing,68
NA,"home arrangements, the way has been opened",68
NA,for those carers to provide for their families,68
NA,by allowing those they are caring for to go,68
NA,into hostels on a respite basis. I think that is,68
NA,important. It ties in with the overall strategy,68
NA,of the Government in the provision of insti-,68
NA,tutional care for older people and the other,68
NA,programs that give a range of options to,68
NA,older people.,68
NA,Often we hear that there has not been,69
NA,provided the amount of consultation that,69
NA,perhaps there should have been. I think we,69
NA,"have to reject that, given the number of",69
NA,reports that were provided to the Govern-,69
NA,ment before the policy was set in place in,69
NA,1986 and given the gradual way in which the,69
NA,Government's policy has been put into place.,69
NA,It is unfair in the extreme to suggest that,69
NA,the voices of not only the people in nursing,69
NA,homes or hostels but also the care providers,69
NA,have not been heard when they have proper,69
NA,comments and criticisms to make.,69
NA,If we also look at the appropriateness of,69
NA,"the program, much has been made about the",69
NA,Government's objective of 100 residential,69
NA,"places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over. In",69
NA,"particular, the criticism from those opposite",69
NA,"rarely relates to the mix of those places, a",69
NA,mix which will see 60 hostel places to 40,69
NA,nursing home places. It is suggested that,69
NA,suddenly the rug will be pulled from under,69
NA,a number of nursing homes in the provision,69
NA,of places. That is not the case. This will be,69
NA,a gradual process and does not necessarily,69
NA,"mean, as I believe some of those sitting op-",69
NA,"posite have suggested, that there will be",69
NA,wholesale closures.,69
NA,"It is unfortunate that, in the area of aged",69
NA,"care, when presented with a scenario like",69
NA,this the Opposition often chooses to tug on,69
NA,the fear of change itself that is ever present,69
NA,in the elderly population. I believe that that,69
NA,is not the way to go. This is an area of,69
NA,policy where we should all be working to-,69
NA,"gether, and that is why the Government has",69
NA,acknowledged the need to put into place,69
NA,gradual changes. Those opposite perhaps for-,69
NA,get when they raise these points that a lot,69
NA,of what we are talking about tonight is the,69
NA,appropriateness of the level of care. When,69
NA,we suggest that in some cases nursing home,69
NA,"treatment is not appropriate, that is not a",69
NA,criticism of individual nursing homes or of,69
NA,the nursing home industry in total. It is a,69
NA,simple statement of fact that often the people,69
NA,who reside in nursing homes do not require,69
NA,the level of care that is provided by nursing,69
NA,homes. Therefore we put into place a proper,69
NA,"procedure, as in this Bill, for improvements",69
NA,"to hostel care, which is an option that gives",69
NA,another level of care to the elderly.,69
NA,Nursing homes and hostels should be seen,69
NA,in their relationship to such programs as the,69
NA,home and community care program where,69
NA,for aged and disabled people the Govern-,69
NA,"ment attempts, with the cooperation of State,",69
NA,local government and other community,69
NA,"agencies, to put in place a wide and varied",69
NA,range of programs that will assist those people,69
NA,for as long as possible to remain in their own,69
NA,homes and to keep their independence and,69
NA,an ability to remain within the community,69
NA,"that is able to support them. In the past,",69
NA,"these options were not available and, unfor-",69
NA,"tunately, people were often inappropriately",69
NA,placed in nursing homes. At least there is,69
NA,now a realisation that we have to look more,69
NA,carefully at the appropriateness of the treat-,69
NA,ment that is given to people who find them-,69
NA,selves in this situation.,69
NA,The shadow Minister for community serv-,69
NA,"ices and aged care, the honourable member",69
NA,"for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite), in his opening",69
NA,"speech earlier in this debate also referred, as",69
NA,"he did in his second reading amendment, to",69
NA,the report I'm Still an Individual. Unfortu-,69
NA,"nately, he took a very dismissive attitude to",69
NA,"the report and, I felt, unfairly belittled what",69
NA,it had to say. He quite extraordinarily,69
NA,plucked from what is a lengthy document-,69
NA,some 170 pages or so-one anecdotal story,69
NA,about a patient and about that person's pet,69
NA,and the effect it had on the person's place-,69
NA,ment in a nursing home. To do that is to,69
NA,dismiss the value of such a document. The,69
NA,"value of this document is not just to patients,",69
NA,to people who reside in nursing home accom-,69
NA,"modation, but to all those who are involved",69
NA,in the provision of these services.,69
NA,I cannot understand why the Opposition,69
NA,"would be expressing, as it does in its amend-",69
NA,"ment, concern at the diminishing morale of",69
NA,the providers of services to the aged because,69
NA,"of various Government initiatives, particu-",69
NA,larly the commissioning of the report I'm,69
NA,Still an Individual. That seems to suggest,69
NA,that in commissioning reports about user,69
NA,rights we are placing the Government in,69
NA,some sort of direct adversarial role with serv-,69
NA,ice providers. That is a nonsense. Service,69
NA,"providers, along with residents, were in-",69
NA,volved in the formulation of the report and,69
NA,they are able to be involved in the continu-,69
NA,ing community consultations surrounding this,69
NA,report. That is important. It is yet further,69
NA,evidence of this Government's ability to con-,69
NA,tinue to provide opportunities for consulta-,69
NA,"tion. When we have the upshot of this, when",70
NA,we see that care providers can work in con-,70
NA,sultation with those who represent residents,70
NA,"and with the residents themselves, we will",70
NA,have a better situation.,70
NA,I want to raise briefly some of the matters,70
NA,that have been raised in the report. One of,70
NA,them was the lack of information that resi-,70
NA,dents of nursing homes suggested they had,70
NA,about their options. It was said that they had,70
NA,not been informed about the range of options,70
NA,"available to them and that, whether it was",70
NA,because a relative wanted to get rid of them,70
NA,by putting them in institutional care or they,70
NA,"were acting in ignorance, in some cases there",70
NA,have been inappropriate placements. That is,70
NA,"a sad feature. It is all right for me, as part",70
NA,"of the Government, to stand here and say",70
NA,"that that is a sad situation, but I know that",70
NA,the Government is addressing the impor-,70
NA,tance of providing the appropriate informa-,70
NA,tion to those individuals that find themselves,70
NA,in a situation of looking for appropriate care.,70
NA,Remarks are made about the life in these,70
NA,"homes, but importantly the report indicates",70
NA,that of the residents contacted many had,70
NA,positive things to say about nursing homes.,70
NA,That needs to be stressed. The negative as-,70
NA,"pects of nursing homes are portrayed, but",70
NA,there are positive aspects and they need to,70
NA,be stressed. I have no doubt that the major-,70
NA,ity of people that work in the nursing homes,70
NA,area-even if it is referred to as an indus-,70
NA,try-have respect for their clients and have,70
NA,their best interests at heart. But sometimes,70
NA,the sort of atmosphere that those people are,70
NA,in-the shadow Minister mentioned this-,70
NA,leads to stress. They know that they cannot,70
NA,give additional time to residents. They are,70
NA,appreciative of the fact that perhaps they,70
NA,"should do a little bit better, but there is a",70
NA,need to do that not only in the context of,70
NA,the way the provider feels but also in the,70
NA,context of the way the resident feels. The,70
NA,nursing home situation is in some ways a,70
NA,form of communal living and there is a need,70
NA,to be constantly aware of the rights of pri-,70
NA,vacy of residents who have gone from a,70
NA,situation of living at home by themselves or,70
NA,from a situation in which the trigger point,70
NA,of the need to go into institutional care is,70
NA,the loss of a spouse. There is a need to treat,70
NA,those residents with dignity and respect.,70
NA,"All in all, as has been acknowledged in",70
NA,this debate by many speakers on both sides,70
NA,"of the House, in the majority of cases it is",70
NA,seen that what is being attempted in the area,70
NA,"of aged care in total and, in particular, in",70
NA,the nursing homes and hostels area is an,70
NA,attempt to set in place appropriate care and,70
NA,a range of options of care that will enable,70
NA,those who are either part of our older pop-,70
NA,ulation or who are suffering forms of disabil-,70
NA,ities that require them to go into residential,70
NA,"type care to be catered for, that the changes",70
NA,"are being thought out in a strategic way, that",70
NA,the changes should be as gradual as possible,70
NA,and that all those involved should be kept,70
NA,properly informed and be able to make com-,70
NA,ment and be involved in the strategic way in,70
NA,which these policies are being put in place.,70
Dr WOODS ,Lowe) (8.43)-1 must say,70
NA,I am absolutely amazed. I presume that the,70
NA,honourable member for Scullin ( Mr Jenkins),70
NA,does not have any nursing homes in his elec-,70
NA,torate. He is so far out of touch with what,70
NA,is happening that that can surely be the only,70
NA,possible explanation for such nonsense. He,70
NA,says that hostel care is another level of sup-,70
NA,port. I point out that it has been there for,70
NA,some considerable time. It is not another,70
NA,"level of support. In fact, it is an inappro-",70
NA,priate level of support for many of the pa-,70
NA,tients who need closer and more careful,70
NA,"attention and who are now, because of this",70
NA,"Government's actions, being pushed into",70
NA,hostel care. For him to say that the home,70
NA,and community care program will take care,70
NA,of some of the problems at the same time as,70
NA,the Government is destroying the guts of,70
NA,that program means that he is completely,70
NA,out of touch with what is actually happening,70
NA,in the real world.,70
NA,His comments on the I'm Still an Individ-,70
NA,ual report bear no resemblance to what many,70
NA,workers in the area feel about that report. I,70
NA,will address that in some detail later. He,70
NA,stated that the rug will not be pulled from,70
NA,under these people. All he was saying was,70
NA,"that the rug will be pulled; it will jl,lst be",70
NA,pulled a little more .slowly than some of,70
NA,them think. He is quite right when he says,70
NA,that we are talking about the appropriate-,70
NA,ness of the level of care. That is the key,70
NA,"concern that we, in the Opposition, and many",70
NA,members of the nursing home and caring,70
NA,industry-if one wants to use that word-,70
NA,have; that the level of care in many of these,71
NA,residences is entirely inappropriate to their,71
NA,needs. That way the Government can cut,71
NA,costs and save more money at the expense,71
NA,of this very vulnerable group in our society.,71
NA,The resident classification instrument,71
NA,"(RCI), for example, may in general terms",71
NA,be an admirable concept. It is basically aimed,71
NA,at getting a balance between the various,71
NA,levels of care and what is offered in the,71
NA,nursing homes and an appropriate remuner-,71
NA,ation for those levels. Although the concept,71
NA,"is very good, ideology takes over. We have",71
NA,the socialist intrusion of stamping everybody,71
NA,with a number; they are all on some point,71
NA,scoring system. Certainly there is no flexibilin,71
NA,ity and there is no concern about the individ-,71
NA,uality of the people concerned. The RCI,71
NA,"structure forces patients, in many cases, in-",71
NA,appropriately into hostels. I think it is very,71
NA,clear from the representations that I am sure,71
NA,the Government has received also that there,71
NA,are now a number of people who are too,71
NA,"frail to be in hostels and who are now,",71
NA,"because of the inflexibility of the RCI, pushed",71
NA,into the hostel accommodation. It is an in-,71
NA,strument of government control.,71
NA,Although we over here certainly support,71
NA,the concept that as many genuinely suitable,71
NA,people as possible should be looked after in,71
NA,"hostels rather than in nursing homes, we",71
NA,have a major concern that a number of the,71
NA,people now in hostels and going into hostels,71
NA,in the near future as a result of this and,71
NA,"associated legislation, are too frail to be in",71
NA,"hostels. They will stay in hostels which, al-",71
NA,"though the staff do a superb job, are in fact",71
NA,now underfunded. They need more staff and,71
NA,the funds for those staff are clearly not,71
NA,"forthcoming from this Government. As I say,",71
NA,it is cost cutting exercise at the expense of,71
NA,the patients.,71
NA,I am amazed at what a wonderful job,71
NA,most hostels do under the pressures they,71
NA,have at present. We often hear of hostels,71
NA,where there is only a single qualified nurse,71
NA,on at a given time to look after the needs of,71
NA,a number of patients. The staffing levels,71
NA,there may be okay if the patients are fit and,71
NA,"pretty well able to look after themselves, as",71
NA,"was the concept for hostels, but the number",71
NA,of frail patients in those hostels has been,71
NA,increased so markedly that the support ser-,71
NA,"vices, the nursing services and the medical",71
NA,services are rapidly becoming inadequate. It,71
NA,is fair to say that a number of these institu-,71
NA,tions are both overstressed arid understaffed,71
NA,for the types of patients they are now ex-,71
NA,pected to care for. One point I endorse and,71
NA,welcome is the proposed admission of carers,71
NA,into hostels with the patients themselves. This,71
NA,is a thoroughly laudable concept and one,71
NA,"which, once the system has been worked out",71
NA,"appropriately, I am sure will work to the",71
NA,benefit of both patients and their families.,71
NA,The honourable member for Scullin talked,71
NA,about the aim of 60 places per thousand frail,71
NA,patients over the age of 70 years. Only 40 of,71
NA,the relevant numbers per thousand would be,71
NA,a nursing home. He failed to mention that,71
NA,this means there would be a reduction on,71
NA,"current figures from 72,000 to 47,000 nursing",71
NA,"homes places-a reduction of 25,000 places.",71
NA,He also conveniently forgot to mention that,71
NA,"those 25,000 places would be lost pretty well",71
NA,entirely from the private sector. As is often,71
NA,"the case, the Government-the left wing of",71
NA,the Government at least-is targeting the,71
NA,"private sector of the nursing home industry,",71
NA,which has been the backbone of the industry,71
NA,for many years. It is also very clear that if,71
NA,in fact any new nursing homes were permit-,71
NA,"ted to set up in operation, they would not",71
NA,"be receiving any recurrent funding. Of course,",71
NA,they very rarely get capital funding in any,71
NA,case. It is quite clear that this is an attempt,71
NA,to remove the private element of the nursing,71
NA,home industry.,71
NA,"At the same time, hostel places will go up",71
NA,"from 43,000 to 70,500. There is only one",71
NA,interpretation to make from these figures;,71
NA,"that is, quite clearly there will be a large",71
NA,number of very frail patients who would,71
NA,otherwise have been in nursing homes but,71
NA,"who will now be in hostels. Some of those,",71
NA,"hopefully a large number, will be appropri-",71
NA,ately in hostels. Equally it is very clear that,71
NA,a large number of those nursing home pa-,71
NA,tients should be in nursing homes and should,71
NA,stay there rather than being shoved down,71
NA,the line to the cheaper-this is the key to,71
NA,"it-hostel accommodation. As I say, those",71
NA,"25,000 nursing home beds will come pretty",71
NA,well entirely from the private industry. There,71
NA,will be no funding for new nursing homes.,71
NA,But more than that there is a attack on,71
NA,another element in the private nursing home,71
NA,"sphere in particular, and that is those nursing",71
NA,homes with less than 20 beds. On the one,72
NA,"hand, the Government is saying that small is",72
NA,"beautiful, that is, that we should get patients",72
NA,out into the community to live in community,72
NA,"nursing homes, community homes of four,",72
NA,"five or six people. On the other hand, there",72
NA,is this pressure on nursing homes to either,72
NA,close down or amalgamate if they happen to,72
NA,"be small, which in this regard means less",72
NA,than 20 beds. So we lose that family atmos-,72
NA,"phere, intimacy, closeness or the concept that",72
NA,"big is beautiful. Big is clearly not beautiful,",72
NA,but from a government's bureaucratic point,72
NA,of view it is easier to handle one big organi-,72
NA,sation rather than several small ones-the,72
NA,bigger the better. This is part of the brave,72
NA,new world bureaucracy-more and more,72
NA,Canberra control in many areas-that the,72
NA,Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr,72
NA,Staples) has looming over us.,72
NA,The Government also has an amazing,72
NA,cheek to release propaganda in the form of,72
NA,"a leaflet entitled I'm Still an Individual,",72
NA,edited by Chris Ronalds. The implication in,72
NA,this document is that the rights of residents,72
NA,have been usurped. It is a fair interpretation,72
NA,of not only the documents itself but the press,72
NA,conferences that have accompanied it that,72
NA,"the residents themselves may be misused, in",72
NA,poor conditions and have not only a host of,72
NA,other complaints but are the norm rather,72
NA,than the exception. I agree that there may,72
NA,be some bad apples in the nursing home,72
NA,sphere. We are all aware that some nursing,72
NA,homes are not as good as others. But this a,72
NA,a gross. misrepresentation of the situation. A,72
NA,number of the witnesses who were inter-,72
NA,viewed by the team producing this document,72
NA,have spoken to me about being misquoted,72
NA,and selected quoting of their comments. They,72
NA,believe that the interpretation which has been,72
NA,put on their own comments is entirely inap-,72
NA,propriate to what they were trying to say to,72
NA,the team writing this particular document. I,72
NA,should point out that residents in nearly every,72
NA,nursing home in the Nursing Home Associa-,72
NA,tion already have their own charter of rights,72
NA,and responsibilities and freedom. It is that,72
NA,way round. It is not only a question of their,72
NA,"rights but also their responsibilities, and",72
NA,is entirely appropriate. The vast majority of,72
NA,nursing homes provide not only freedom to,72
NA,"them as individuals but good caring,. good",72
NA,"basic amenities and good food. On the whole,",72
NA,"the nursing homes are run by caring, com-",72
NA,passionate people. This document was de-,72
NA,scribed very neatly by one of my constituents,72
NA,whose parents are in the Jesmond Nursing,72
NA,Home in my constituency as 'a trendy piece,72
NA,of paper that will get a lot of publicity but,72
NA,do nothing for the old people'.,72
NA,It is quite two-faced for the Government,72
NA,to support this recommendation that aged,72
NA,members of the community should have more,72
NA,say in where they go and what their rights,72
NA,are when it is the Government's own cost,72
NA,cutting policies which restrict entry to nurs-,72
NA,ing homes to the very frail who are often,72
NA,unable to communicate their wishes anyway.,72
NA,It is pure hypocrisy. Freedom of the individ-,72
NA,ual is paramount and does generally occur.,72
NA,This Government should support that and,72
NA,this document does not help that concept.,72
NA,Another matter related to this particular,72
NA,problem is the question of resident funded,72
NA,hostels. In New South Wales alone there are,72
NA,"some 600 resident funded hostel beds, mainly",72
NA,"run by the Uniting Church and, to a lesser",72
NA,"extent, the Seventh Day Adventist Church.",72
NA,"Basically, the concept here is that residents,",72
NA,"on their retirement, make an interest free",72
NA,loan to the board running the hostel to pay,72
NA,for their accommodation in their retirement.,72
NA,This is a refundable loan. This is true self-,72
NA,help. The only funding that these hostels get,72
NA,from the government is a subsidy for addi-,72
NA,"tional nursing. Apart from this, they are",72
NA,"entirely self-supporting. In many cases, these",72
NA,are people who have often scrimped and,72
NA,saved for their own retirement. They have,72
NA,looked after themselves. It actually cuts,72
NA,Government costs. The 600-odd beds in New,72
NA,"South Wales, forgetting about the inflation",72
NA,"rate under this Government, is over $1O.8m",72
NA,"at 1980 prices. What has happened now, of",72
NA,"course, is that there is a requirement that",72
NA,one in five patients in these resident funded,72
NA,hostels be financially disadvantaged. It is a,72
NA,laudable aim-and I am happy to say that,72
NA,we should provide places for financially dis-,72
NA,"abled people-but, unfortunately, this dis-",72
NA,criminates against people who have scrimped,72
NA,"and saved for their retirement. For example,",72
NA,"that Woodfield, one of the nursing homes in the",72
NA,"inner west of Sydney, instead of paying",72
NA,"$55,000 as an interest free loan, has in-",72
NA,creased that to cover the cost of the extra,72
NA,"financially disabled people to $68,750. In",72
NA,"effect, this is an extra capital tax upon a",73
NA,group of aged people. It is yet another pen-,73
NA,alty on those who have actually tried to save,73
NA,and provide for their own retirement. It is a,73
NA,penalty on thrift.,73
NA,I believe very strongly that we should en-,73
NA,courage self-help and not penalise it. It seems,73
NA,that this problem has arisen because Peter,73
NA,"Staples, the Minister, was not even aware",73
NA,that resident funded hostels existed. This is,73
NA,the same Peter Staples who this evening in-,73
NA,formed the Pharmaceutical Society of Aus-,73
NA,tralia that he would not turn up for its,73
NA,meeting because it was going to criticise him,73
NA,and he duly did not turn up to the meeting.,73
NA,"This is the Peter Staples, the Minister, who",73
NA,is supposed to be aware of the situation in,73
NA,his Government.,73
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Ronald,73
NA,Edwards )-Order! I suggest to the honour-,73
NA,able member that he should refer to the,73
NA,Minister by his appropriate title.,73
Dr WOODS,It changes so often. Is it,73
NA,Aged Care?,73
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Nevertheless,",73
NA,it is beholden upon the honourable mem:ber,73
NA,to be certain of the Minister's title if he,73
NA,wishes to refer to him.,73
Dr WOODS,Resident funded hostels,73
NA,should be clearly excluded from this bureau-,73
NA,"cratic outrage. The charities involved, mainly",73
NA,the Uniting and Seventh Day Adventist,73
NA,"churches, have been pushed into signing so-",73
NA,called lOF agreements for their continued,73
NA,funding. They have signed these under pro-,73
NA,test. Amongst the other problems they have,73
NA,are the extra bureaucratic requirements in,73
NA,addition to the financially disabled people's,73
NA,"regulations. For example, the Government",73
NA,requires information of a legal nature of,73
NA,"residents' rights. It requires extra details, al-",73
NA,though it does not actually say which records,73
NA,"it requires, of residents' private arrangements",73
NA,with the nursing homes. All this has to be in,73
NA,a form to be determined by the Department.,73
NA,"As the charities say, which form? It is clearly",73
NA,a Commonwealth form. It is more intrusion,73
NA,"and ministerial control, which may be ap-",73
NA,"pealing to the relevant Minister, but is not",73
NA,appropriate to the good care of these,73
NA,residents.,73
NA,There have been submissions from the,73
NA,Challenge Foundation about the concept,73
NA,which is embodied in this legislation of mov-,73
NA,"ing people, particularly the inteHectually dis-",73
NA,"abled, out from this sort of hostel",73
NA,accommodation into community homes of,73
NA,four or five people. We all think that it is,73
NA,"admirable in principle, but there are a num-",73
NA,ber of problems in doing this. Some of these,73
NA,intellectually disabled people in particular,73
NA,will never cope in houses of four or five,73
NA,"people. To cope adequately, most will need",73
NA,increased care and increased financial sup-,73
NA,port to provide that care. As far as we can,73
NA,"see, the Government is not planning to pro-",73
NA,vide the necessary financial infrastructure to,73
NA,allow the appropriate care for these people,73
NA,to survive in the community home concept.,73
NA,". The intellectually disabled are, indeed, a very",73
NA,. special case. If appropriate care is not avail-,73
NA,"able in community based accommodation,",73
NA,then they may well find that this approach,73
NA,is not only of no benefit but actually detri-,73
NA,mental to their ongoing self-esteem and self-,73
NA,management. The Richmond scheme high-,73
NA,lighted some of the problems involved in this,73
NA,"area. Unfortunately, the Government has not",73
NA,learnt from those particular problems. Hos-,73
NA,tel style accommodation can be every bit as,73
NA,"good as cottage style accommodation, so long",73
NA,as it is run by the appropriate organisations,73
NA,"with caring, involvement, experience and the",73
NA,necessary financial infrastructure. I appeal to,73
NA,the Government not to throw out the baby,73
NA,with the bath water in regard to this partic-,73
NA,ular aspect of the intellectually disabled.,73
NA,Another question related to this whole leg-,73
NA,"islation, clearly not spelt out completely to",73
NA,"everybody's satisfaction, is the question of",73
NA,moving people away from sheltered work-,73
NA,"shops and reducing or abolishing the funding,",73
NA,depending on which Government represent-,73
NA,ative of the week one listens to. Although,73
NA,the Opposition supports the concept that the,73
NA,intellectually disabled should be moved out,73
NA,"if possible into general industry, into the",73
NA,"community, we and a large number of the",73
NA,parents of these people are very concerned,73
NA,that a large number of people who are not,73
NA,suitable to be moved out into the community,73
NA,will be moved out inappropriately. Many,73
NA,"will, therefore, fail in the move to the out-",73
NA,side community. Instead of going to a shel-,73
NA,"tered workshop or the equivalent, they will",73
NA,be forced to stay at home. There is a need,73
NA,for a number of procedures. There is a need,73
NA,to educate the community. The community,74
NA,into which these people are moving needs to,74
NA,be--,74
NA,Mr Blunt-Not to mention the trade,74
NA,unions.,74
Dr WOODS,Especially the trade unions.,74
NA,The community needs to be trained in the,74
NA,"problems which these people actually face,",74
NA,otherwise we will find that they are doing,74
NA,"menial tasks, they will be the butts of abuse",74
NA,"and humour, and they will be exploited.",74
NA,Many of these people have been through,74
NA,that before they went to the sheltered work-,74
NA,shops and have come through that problem,74
NA,"only to be faced now, because of this Gov-",74
NA,"ernment's action, with the possibility of being",74
NA,put back there. For that small number of,74
NA,"people in the sheltered workshops, we en-",74
NA,tirely support the concept of moving them,74
NA,into industry and exposing them to the out-,74
NA,side world. The Government needs to make,74
NA,sure that the funding to support this is en-,74
NA,tirely available. For those for whom it is not,74
NA,"possible, and never will be possible, either",74
NA,sheltered workshops or similar organisations,74
NA,would be entirely appropriate and need to,74
NA,?e supported. I mention in passing that the,74
NA,Job support scheme has done a superb job in,74
NA,"this regard, but it does need more financing",74
NA,and expanding to have a larger impact upon,74
NA,what is in fact a very significant number of,74
NA,intellectually disabled people.,74
NA,"In summary, I would like to say, therefore,",74
NA,that the changes which the Government has,74
NA,in mind may be very admirable in principle,74
NA,but they need to be implemented very care-,74
NA,"fully, with adequate funding and with train-",74
NA,ing and education for the outside community.,74
NA,We need to retain the good points of the,74
NA,current systems. We do not need change for,74
NA,change's sake. We need to minimise the,74
NA,bureaucracy and the red tape involved not,74
NA,only for the patients but also for the nursing,74
NA,homes and other organisations which are in-,74
NA,volved in caring for what is a very vital and,74
NA,important part of our community.,74
Dr HARRY EDWARDS ,Berowra),74
NA,(9.01)-1 do not propose to detain the House,74
NA,"for long, but I wish to make just a few",74
NA,supplementary remarks to the very compre-,74
NA,hensive survey of the subject by my col-,74
NA,league the honourable member for Lowe (Dr,74
NA,"Woods), who has just resumed his seat.",74
NA,Mr Smith-A good speech.,74
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,An excellent,74
NA,speech. The Aged or Disabled Persons Homes,74
NA,Amendment Bill is within the context of the,74
NA,Government's changed approach to the pro-,74
NA,v-sion of acco-modation for the aged and,74
NA,dIsabled followmg the 1986 nursing homes,74
NA,and hostels review. This approach has now,74
NA,been in place for the last 18 months. In,74
NA,"concept it is a 'needs based' approach, in",74
NA,contrast to what was referred to as the 'sub-,74
NA,mission model' of previous years. Faced with,74
NA,the inevitable expansion of aged persons ac-,74
NA,commodation with the ageing of Australia's,74
NA,population-this is so well documented I will,74
NA,not give any figures-this Bill seeks to ensure,74
NA,"a 'bet-er targeting', or rather a more specific",74
NA,"targetmg, of government subsidised services",74
NA,to persons in need and to areas in need-as,74
NA,there are areas apparently disadvantaged in,74
NA,the aged care accommodation stakes. These,74
NA,are circumstances in which it is imperative,74
NA,to contain government expenditure-it is,74
NA,good to see that the Minister for Housing,74
NA,and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) and his De-,74
NA,"partment recognise that, because this cannot",74
NA,"be said of the Treasurer, the honourable",74
NA,"member for Blaxland ( Mr Keating), who has",74
NA,very complacently said that the process of,74
NA,expenditure reduction has gone about as far,74
NA,"as it can. It certainly has not, as the Govern-",74
NA,ment will very soon come to recognise. There,74
NA,"are p.lenty of studies around by reasonable,",74
NA,practIcal men that. could give the Govern-,74
NA,"ment a lead in this, and which are not the",74
NA,"'mindless shrieks of ideologues', as the Treas-",74
NA,urer accused last Budget time.,74
NA,So in circumstances where it is imperative,74
NA,"t? contain government spending, the empha-",74
NA,SIS on a needs based approach is entirely,74
NA,"appropriate, and I accept that. It is a pity",74
NA,that the Government does not more widely,74
NA,embrace the principle-and I have particu-,74
NA,larly in mind the health care system. But,74
NA,while the principle of a needs based ap-,74
NA,"proach is a good one, I get worried when",74
NA,such a policy is to be administered by,74
NA,socialists.,74
NA,Mr Cowan-You must have flexibility.,74
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,That is what it,74
NA,will not have if it is administered by social-,74
NA,"ists, and I will come back to that in a mo-",75
NA,ment. When we study the detail and the real,75
NA,"thrust of this legislation, we see there is",75
NA,"serious cause for concern, as Opposition",75
NA,speakers who have preceded me have pointed,75
NA,"out. First, there is nothing in this legislation",75
NA,or funding approach designed effectively to,75
NA,utilise and encourage the private sector. As,75
NA,my colleague the honourable member for,75
NA,Macquarie ( Mr Webster) put it the other,75
NA,"night, that is counterproductive to, and in-",75
NA,"deed a betrayal of, the interests of the aged",75
NA,"persons the legislation is intended to help, It",75
NA,is difficult to escape the conclusion that,75
NA,is on the Government's side an underlying,75
NA,antagonism towards the involvement of the,75
NA,private sector in providing these services-,75
NA,not just discouragement of new private en-,75
NA,"terprise hostels and nursing services, but ar-",75
NA,rangements that will have the effect of,75
NA,"phasing out, driving out, existing private en-",75
NA,terprise establishments.,75
NA,Mr Braithwaite-Quite deliberately.,75
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,Quite deliber-,75
NA,"ately, as the shadow Minister says. The pri-",75
NA,"vate sector is being squeezed at both ends,",75
NA,particularly nursing homes. They will be pre-,75
NA,vented by this legislation from taking more,75
NA,"than 87.5 per cent of pension from patients,",75
NA,irrespective of whether the patients can af-,75
NA,ford to pay more. That provision is pre-,75
NA,sented as a great plUS: The Hawke,75
NA,Government avers that by 1990-shades of,75
NA,the reference to children in poverty-no-one,75
NA,will be required to pay more than 87.5 per,75
NA,cent of pension for accommodation in a,75
NA,nursing home. Again it is like no-one having,75
NA,to pay more than the schedule fee for medi-,75
NA,cal services-if people can get them. But in,75
NA,"typical socialist fashion, that commitment",75
NA,begins to foul up the overall aged accom-,75
NA,modation and care situation. It pretty effec-,75
NA,tively does away with the private enterprise,75
NA,"provision for the top end of the market and,",75
NA,"in that way, adds to the overall imbalance,",75
NA,"indeed shortage, of accommodation.",75
NA,We have only to consider the parallel sit-,75
NA,uation of school funding to recognise the,75
NA,wrong-headedness of eliminating capital,75
NA,funding to private sector service providers.,75
NA,In not doing so it is like cutting off one's,75
NA,"nose to spite one's face, as my colleague put",75
NA,it the other night. Thus capital funding sup-,75
NA,port for private schools allows the school,75
NA,itself and the provision of schooling at a,75
NA,lesser cost to the taxpayer than if fully pro-,75
NA,vided by the public sector. That same consid-,75
NA,eration surely applies to hostels.,75
NA,"Added to this, there is the squeeze from",75
NA,"the official funding components, the so-called",75
NA,standard aggregate module (SAM) and the,75
NA,care aggregate module (CAM) components.,75
NA,"The latter, CAM, has been suggested by",75
NA,some to mean 'caring attitude missing' from,75
NA,this Government! But there is a squeeze re-,75
NA,sulting from these being set at levels which,75
NA,are notably less than the actual cost figures,75
NA,there supplied by the private nursing home asso-,75
NA,"ciations, and all this puts the private hostels",75
NA,and homes under great pressure. There is,75
NA,out there-this does not seem to be recog-,75
NA,nised by the Government-a great deal of,75
NA,"pressure, apprehension and even despair at",75
NA,this time. One cannot counter that just by,75
NA,"pointing to some private operators, under",75
NA,whom admittedly there has been insufficient,75
NA,"care and dedication, and some patient ne-",75
NA,"glect, and so on.",75
NA,I repeat: a reasonable and responsible ap-,75
NA,proach to policy in this area would recognise,75
NA,the potential for the private sector playing a,75
NA,significant role in meeting future accommo-,75
NA,"dation and care needs, which are going to be",75
NA,"very large indeed. But this Government, in",75
NA,"contrast with that, has seen fit to inhibit and",75
NA,"discourage such a private sector role, to the",75
NA,longer term detriment of the aged citizens of,75
NA,this nation.,75
NA,I spoke at the beginning of two Opposition,75
NA,concerns at the Government's approach. Its,75
NA,failure to encourage a larger participation of,75
NA,the private sector is one. The second is the,75
NA,bureaucratic rigidity and inflexibility that my,75
NA,"colleague referred to a moment ago, inevita-",75
NA,bly associated with such a centralised public,75
NA,sector biased community service planning,75
NA,"operation-this bureaucratic outrage, as my",75
NA,colleague the honourable member for Lowe,75
NA,called it a moment ago. In this respect I wish,75
NA,only to refer to an initiative by certain public,75
NA,spirited citizens who belong to a local com-,75
NA,"munity organisation from the township, sub-",75
NA,"urb, of Berowra in my electorate. I mention",75
NA,particularly Messrs Bill and Ernie Foster. I,75
NA,"say 'township' deliberately, because the com-",75
NA,munity of Berowra in my electorate is some-,75
NA,what isolated and is situated between,75
NA,"Hornsby-Asquith-Mount Colah, which is the",75
NA,"northern limit of metropolitan Sydney, and",76
NA,"the Hawkesbury River, which forms the",76
NA,northern border of my electorate. This is by,76
NA,no means a high income area when com-,76
NA,pared with some other parts of this electoral,76
NA,division.,76
NA,The proposal to which I refer is the estab-,76
NA,lishment of a low cost residential accommo-,76
NA,dation and care complex for the frail and,76
NA,aged in the Berowra township. The commu-,76
NA,nity organisation that I referred to is in a,76
NA,position to make a significant capital contri-,76
NA,"bution to the project but, of course, the sum",76
NA,available is by no means adequate to fund,76
NA,the construction costs in their entirety. The,76
NA,essence of the case put for this proposal is,76
NA,"that the Berowra township is, as I have said,",76
NA,a somewhat isolated community with a pop-,76
NA,"ulation now of the order of 16,000 people.",76
NA,There is no aged accommodation whatsoever,76
NA,anywhere near it. The fact is that in the,76
NA,"whole Hornsby-Berowra area, which stretches",76
NA,from the northern outskirts of Hornsby right,76
NA,up to and including Wisemans Ferry-an,76
NA,area of the order of 10 times the size of the,76
NA,balance of the regional planning area-there,76
NA,"is no aged accommodation at all. Yet, the",76
NA,application for assistance for this proposal,76
NA,meets with a stereotyped bureaucratic re-,76
NA,sponse. A recent response from the relevant,76
NA,Commonwealth department reads as follows:,76
NA,"As you may be aware, the Government has adopted",76
NA,the recommendations made in the Nursing Home,76
NA,"and Hostel Review. That is, the growth of residential",76
NA,care services should be planned on the basis of ratio,76
NA,"of 100 residential care places per 1,000 people aged",76
NA,70 and over in all areas of Australia. The objective,76
NA,is to achieve 60 hostel places and 40 nursing home,76
NA,"places per 1,000 aged people. Funding rounds are",76
NA,now concentrating on those areas that have a hostel,76
NA,"ratio of 30 or less places per 1,000 aged people.",76
NA,I also wish to advise that a planning area takes in,76
NA,account the ratio of residential care services provided,76
NA,"in the entire Local Government Area, not areas",76
NA,within the LGA.,76
NA,The planning area for Hornsby-Ku-Ring-Gai has,76
NA,a combined hostel and nursing home ratio of 172,76
NA,"places per 1,000 aged people.",76
NA,It goes on to express regret that the pro-,76
NA,posal could not be funded. What appears in',76
NA,no way to be taken into account is that the,76
NA,relevant local government area includes a,76
NA,"number of very large retirement complexes,",76
NA,such as the Mowll Village and related vil-,76
NA,lages complex at Castle Hill.,76
NA,Mr Cowan-It has a wonderful reputation.,76
Dr HARRY EDWARDS,"Yes, it has. I",76
NA,was going to say that it is among the largest,76
NA,and the very best in all Australia. This com-,76
NA,"plex draws its clients from all over Sydney,",76
NA,"New South Wales and, for that matter, Aus-",76
NA,tralia. I repeat that no allowance is made for,76
NA,that fact. The guideline figures quoted in the,76
NA,response that I read out and confirmed in,76
NA,this legislation are inflexibly applied as a,76
NA,bureaucratic imperative and completely ne-,76
NA,"glect the reality of this local situation. So,",76
NA,this very worthy local initiative has been,76
NA,stifled. Some way of affording it any assist-,76
NA,"ance at all has, apparently, not even been",76
NA,explored. I take this opportunity to appeal,76
NA,to the Minister and the Department to sit,76
NA,down and have another look at this worthy,76
NA,proposal from this organisation in Berowra.,76
NA,"The Opposition is not opposing this Bill,",76
NA,nor the needs principle on which it is based.,76
NA,But we express serious concerns about the,76
NA,"Government's approach, such as those to",76
NA,which I have referred. I support the amend-,76
NA,ment that was moved by the honourable,76
NA,member for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite).,76
Mr COWAN ,Lyne) (9.l6)-Australia,76
NA,can rightfully claim to be fairly well down,76
NA,the track so far as the care of our aged,76
NA,people is concerned. I think the Aged or,76
NA,Disabled Persons Homes Amendment Bill,76
NA,"1988, which we are discussing this evening,",76
NA,is just another step in what the Government,76
NA,sees as being needed to keep up with the,76
NA,advancement of aged care. As the honour-,76
NA,able member for Berowra (Dr Harry Ed-,76
NA,"wards) pointed out, we agree with the Bill",76
NA,in relation to which the honourable member,76
NA,for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) has moved a,76
NA,second reading amendment. But I wish to,76
NA,point out certain factors relating to it that,76
NA,are of some concern to the Opposition. From,76
NA,"listening to this debate, I believe that certain",76
NA,Government members also see problems in,76
NA,respect of the Bill.,76
NA,We have to realise that taxpayers' money,76
NA,is being used for the care of certain people,76
NA,within our society. Today over five million,76
NA,Australians are drawing a pension of some,76
NA,kind-principally the age pension. Common-,76
NA,wealth and State governments have a com-,76
NA,mitment to contribute towards certain care.,76
NA,I do not think there is any great objection,76
NA,"to this in principle, but there are certain",76
NA,things that we have to be careful about in,76
NA,this respect. Both governments and opposiquirements,77
NA,tions must realise that when taxpayers' money,77
NA,is being made available for the care of,77
NA,"tain groups within the community, governliament",77
NA,ments must keep some control. The 'What,77
NA,legislation before the House is a typical,77
NA,ample of a government on the one hand,77
NA,trying to keep control of taxpayers' money,77
NA,and on the other hand protecting certain,77
NA,"people, such as the underprivileged, low",77
NA,come earners and other people in the com-,77
NA,munity who need help. None of us object to,77
NA,this because we have hearts that are that,77
NA,way inclined. I am sure that the privileged,77
NA,in our community want to help those who,77
NA,are less fortunate. But we have to appreciate,77
NA,that the standards of care must be kept,77
NA,particularly so far as health is concerned.,77
NA,We have to make sure that what we are it,77
NA,"doing, with good intentions-and the legisan",77
NA,lation before us is an example of this-does,77
NA,not ultimately mean that somebody or some,77
NA,group within the community will be disadmust,77
NA,"vantaged. I particularly refer to financially,",77
NA,physically or mentally disadvantaged people,77
NA,who want to be and should be in a nursing,77
NA,home or institution. These people should not,77
NA,be further disadvantaged.,77
NA,People are living longer today. If there is,77
NA,"one thing that aged people do not want, it",77
NA,stress. They need health care. I am conto,77
NA,cerned that aged people from the metropoltributions,77
NA,itan areas have turned up in my electorate,77
NA,office and have told me that they have,77
NA,worked for a lifetime just to put a bit,77
NA,money aside so as they can care for themisations,77
NA,selves. But because of asset testing and,77
NA,high costs of living today they are unable,77
NA,live the lifestyle that they would like to,77
NA,retirement or meet their demands for housto,77
NA,ing and health care. This is a tremendous,77
NA,stress upon many Australians.,77
NA,"One thing that members of this House,",77
NA,"whether in government or in opposition,",77
NA,should seek to avoid is placing continual,77
NA,stress on aged people within the community.,77
NA,Each one of us will eventually reach the,77
NA,stage where this problem arises. Australia,77
NA,has the problem of inflation. It is not,77
NA,only country in the world with that problem.,77
NA,In addition we have so many regulations that,77
NA,today one almost needs to be a bush lawyer,77
NA,to cope with the demands of the social,77
NA,"curity system, with its regulations and",77
NA,dealing with aged care. One needs,77
NA,to have a legal mind or the assistance of,77
NA,cersomebody such as a member of Federal Par-,77
NA,"whom one can consult and ask,",77
NA,does all this mean?'. Even honourable,77
NA,exmembers need expert assistance in under-,77
NA,standing the requirements of the social se-,77
NA,curity system. We are fortunate that officers,77
NA,of the Department are available to assist us,77
NA,into advise constituents about these matters.,77
NA,Many aged persons are coming to my elec-,77
NA,"torate to live, having retired from the met-",77
NA,ropolitan areas. They are attracted to the,77
NA,"electorate because homes are cheaper, the",77
NA,"geography of the area is good, the atmos-",77
NA,phere is marvellous to live in. It is because,77
NA,"up, of my experience with these people that I",77
NA,sound the warning to the Government that,77
NA,is dealing with taxpayers' money. That is,77
NA,important thing that should not be for-,77
NA,gotten. In any legislation that comes before,77
NA,the Parliament there must be flexibility. We,77
NA,consider the foundation of legislation,77
NA,that comes before us to see what its effect is,77
NA,going to be on the ordinary people of Aus-,77
NA,tralia. We must ensure that the legislation is,77
NA,flexible so that aged people can be cared for,77
NA,properly.,77
NA,Let honourable members never forget that,77
NA,is private enterprise has contributed immensely,77
NA,aged care in Australia. The greatest con-,77
NA,have been made by community,77
NA,"groups and churches, organisations that over",77
NA,the years have displayed greater foresight,77
NA,of than any government ever has. These organ-,77
NA,have raised the money for aged care,77
NA,the establishments.. I can point to people who,77
NA,"to . contributed, beyond their means, sums of",77
NA,"in $2,000 and $3,000 and even up to $100,000",77
NA,support the establishment of a nursing,77
NA,home in their own community. I can cite the,77
NA,example at the moment in the Great Lakes,77
NA,Shire of people at Bulahdelah who have re-,77
NA,sponded in relation to the 40 nursing home,77
NA,beds that were advertised as available within,77
NA,the shire. Within one week the people of,77
NA,that small township with a population of just,77
NA,"over a thousand raised more than $300,000,",77
NA,the with the support and backup of the sur-,77
NA,"rounding rural community. These people,",77
NA,"who have good hearts, said that they wanted",77
NA,a nursing home to accommodate aged people,77
NA,sewithin their community-men and women,77
NA,rewho are not being cared for. They have said,77
NA,"to the Government, 'We will comply with",78
NA,your policy and we will put up the money'.,78
NA,"They will put up double the fee, if need be,",78
NA,to provide their share of the cost of a 40-,78
NA,bed nursing horne. They will equip the horne,78
NA,and run it.,78
NA,I remind the House that farming commu-,78
NA,nity groups grow the vegetables and fruit,78
NA,that are needed in the nursing homes. They,78
NA,corne in with their baskets full and the ladies,78
NA,of the group cook cakes for the aged people.,78
NA,They are an example of the wonderful co-,78
NA,operation that this nation needs. I mention,78
NA,this matter because it is so important and,78
NA,the Government should never overlook it.,78
NA,These local citizens cook the cakes and grow,78
NA,the vegetables and fruit; they also provide,78
NA,butter and milk and other things to assist,78
NA,the local community nursing horne or hostel,78
NA,and units. The important fact is that the,78
NA,people of the local community are part of,78
NA,the provision of aged care accommodation.,78
NA,Never let us reach the stage in this coun-,78
NA,"try where we, as members of Parliament, do",78
NA,anything to take away any of that pride from,78
NA,these local people or discount in any way,78
NA,the generosity that they display in contrib-,78
NA,uting to the atmosphere and environment of,78
NA,every individual within the aged care estab-,78
NA,lishment. I am not dealing with the techni-,78
NA,"calities of the legislation, I am dealing with",78
NA,the principle of what people want. The av-,78
NA,erage Australian citizen wants to care for his,78
NA,"mother and father, his uncle or cousin, or",78
NA,the poor old person who lives next door or,78
NA,down the road. Those are the people we,78
NA,have to think about and that is why I speak,78
NA,again about flexibility. Like the honourable,78
NA,"member for Page ( Mr Ian Robinson), I visit",78
NA,the nursing homes in my electorate as often,78
NA,as I can. I do not know of one person in a,78
NA,nursing horne in my electorate who should,78
NA,not be there. I do not know of one person,78
NA,who could genuinely be taken out of a nurs-,78
NA,ing horne in my electorate and put into a,78
NA,hostel. I do not think any of these people,78
NA,could care for themselves. They need a max-,78
NA,imum of care. They need care 24 hours a,78
NA,day because they are ill and aged. They,78
NA,cannot get out of their beds for most of the,78
NA,time.,78
NA,I cannot see the position that Government,78
NA,members talk about when they say that there,78
NA,are aged patients in nursing homes who could,78
NA,be in a hostel. Where does one draw the line,78
NA,within a hostel? At what stage does one,78
NA,bring in nursing? These are all matters that,78
NA,are categorised in the Bill that will have to,78
NA,be worked out as time goes on. At the mo-,78
NA,ment two or three nursing homes are being,78
NA,constructed in my electorate. Already there,78
NA,are a dozen or more nursing homes and,78
NA,"hostels within my electorate. As I said, from",78
NA,a geographical point of view the area is an,78
NA,ideal place to go to live. I have been involved,78
NA,with these establishments not for one year,78
NA,but for 35 or 40 years. I helped to start one,78
NA,"in the days when people said, 'There will be",78
NA,nobody to occupy the beds. Who are we,78
NA,going to get to occupy them?'. We started,78
NA,with 18 beds and such was the demand that,78
NA,three months after they were opened there,78
NA,were 70 people waiting for beds.,78
NA,"When it comes to categorising these people,",78
NA,I would not like to be a member of the,78
NA,assessment team. It will have great difficulty,78
NA,fitting in with the requirements of categoris-,78
NA,ation that the Government is placing within,78
NA,the legislation. I have not attended the sem-,78
NA,inars to hear these things spoken about. It,78
NA,may be that the method of categorisation,78
NA,has already been worked out very thor-,78
NA,"oughly, but the existing nursing homes and",78
NA,hostels want to know a lot more about,78
NA,categorisation and particularly about the,78
NA,reimbursements they are going to receive. It,78
NA,is important for the administrators of a nurs-,78
NA,ing horne or hostel to know these things.,78
NA,Today there are many different designs of,78
NA,hostels and nursing homes. I give full credit,78
NA,to the Department of Housing and Aged,78
NA,Care for adopting and approving new types,78
NA,of designs. I mention the example of Har-,78
NA,bourside Haven at Nelson Bay within my,78
NA,"electorate, which accommodates almost 300",78
NA,"people in the units, the hostel and the nurs-",78
NA,ing horne. It is a marvellous place. The De-,78
NA,partment has recently approved another 40-,78
NA,bed hostels. The administrators would like to,78
NA,build another twoor three-storey building.,78
NA,"What is the matter with that, so long as a",78
NA,lift is installed in the building? This is the,78
NA,sort of change that is corning into these,78
NA,establishments today. Clusters are also be-,78
NA,coming a feature of nursing homes and hos-,78
NA,"tels, which I think is a good idea. There are",78
NA,excellent designs. I pay tribute to the,78
NA,"churches, the community groups and the",78
NA,lodges that over the years have gained tre-,79
NA,mendous experience in the design of these,79
NA,institutions for the convenience of the guests,79
NA,in them and the nurses and administrative,79
NA,staff who have to cope with the demands of,79
NA,the running of the establishment. It is impor-,79
NA,tant that we look at these designs to know,79
NA,in what direction we are going. The honour-,79
NA,able member for Lowe (Dr Woods) made,79
NA,an important point when he spoke earlier,79
NA,about categorisation. We do not want the,79
NA,"stage to be reached where an aged person,",79
NA,who has over a lifetime contributed to the,79
NA,"well-being of the nation, will be categorised",79
NA,"as one, two, three, four or five, and known",79
NA,as such. We do not want this. I hope it never,79
NA,happens to me.,79
NA,Mr Braithwaite-It happens.,79
Mr COWAN,As the honourable member,79
NA,"for Dawson said, it happens and he pointed",79
NA,this out when he led for the National Party,79
NA,in the debate. We do not wimt this to hap-,79
NA,"pen to any Australian, whether he or she be",79
NA,"Aboriginal, poor person or the wealthiest",79
NA,person in Australia. I do not care who the,79
NA,person is; he or she should not be catego-,79
NA,rised. I ask the Government and the Minister,79
NA,for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) in,79
NA,particular to be careful to see that this,79
NA,"not happen, for the sake of the people of",79
NA,Australia. We do not want to see such a,79
NA,situation arise.,79
NA,What is wrong with a pensioner paying,79
NA,more than 87t per cent of his pension to-,79
NA,wards his nursing home accommodation? If,79
NA,the pensioner has some money set aside and,79
NA,"wants to help with the running of the home,",79
NA,or assist in getting more nursing home or,79
NA,"hostel beds, what is wrong with his being",79
NA,able to contribute more? The Government,79
NA,says that by 1990 nobody will pay more than,79
NA,87.5 per cent of his pension towards the cost,79
NA,of accommodation in a nursing home. I know,79
NA,what it is directing its attention to; we all,79
NA,know about that. But what is wrong with a,79
NA,"person who wants to contribute more, to",79
NA,"assist the home or hostel, doing so if he",79
NA,wishes?,79
NA,We all know-both the Opposition and,79
NA,the Government-that in aged care in Aus-,79
NA,tralia we have a tiger by the tail. We have a,79
NA,great responsibility in this area. We hope,79
NA,that the Government will be' able to meet,79
NA,"this responsibility. We hope, in the process,",79
NA,that future governments will give encourage-,79
NA,"ment to community groups, churches, lodges",79
NA,"and other private enterprise groups, to cater",79
NA,for this need. The provision of beds is im-,79
NA,portant. We do not want to socialise this,79
NA,country and present the Government with a,79
NA,fast track method completely to take over,79
NA,and control these community groups.,79
NA,The States will say that they have nursing,79
NA,home patients in hospital beds around the,79
NA,States. They are scattered here and there.,79
NA,We know that that is so. They have some,79
NA,"responsibility to look after them, too. But",79
NA,the fact is that the planning that we do in,79
NA,the short and long term I am sure will be,79
NA,very good. We do not know whether there,79
NA,may be a hidden agenda. The honourable,79
NA,member for Dawson referred to this point.,79
NA,He knows what I mean. What is the hidden,79
NA,agenda? We hope that there is not one. We,79
NA,know that we are only at a certain stage,79
NA,with regard to aged care in Australia-and,79
NA,"rightfully so, because we must be flexible.",79
NA,We have to adjust the situation as time goes,79
NA,by. We have to meet the extra demands that,79
NA,we will have.,79
NA,I do not want to be parochial and I have,79
NA,does not been since I was first elected to this,79
NA,place. As a Federal member of parliament I,79
NA,can say that the only money that we get,79
NA,directly for our electorates is for aged people,79
NA,accommodation and private schools-unless,79
NA,a community employment program grant is,79
NA,available around the corner.,79
NA,Mr Ian Robinson-Or a road or two.,79
Mr COWAN,That is right; perhaps a,79
NA,road or two.,79
NA,NA,79
Mr COWAN,We used to get it. I will,79
NA,look after my electorate in terms of aged,79
NA,care. I will fight any legislation that is con-,79
NA,sidered by this House that I do not believe,79
NA,is in the interests of the 20 to 25 per cent of,79
NA,my total constituency who have retired in,79
NA,"my electorate, in one of the best parts of",79
NA,Australia. Those people have had enough,79
NA,worry in regard to the assets test and many,79
NA,other matters. We do not want to see aged,79
NA,care become a problem.,79
NA,I appeal to the Government to think of,79
NA,the matters that we have spoken about in,79
NA,this debate . I spoke earlier about the Nelson,80
NA,Bay Harbourside Haven. Legacy provided,80
NA,funding for three beds there. Those beds,80
NA,"have been in place for a year or so, yet they",80
NA,are still empty as they have not been ap-,80
NA,proved. I hope that the Minister will soon,80
NA,approve those three beds and make them,80
NA,available to people who need them. I spoke,80
NA,"of Bulahdelah. I can talk about Taree, Tun-",80
NA,"curry-Forster, Port Macquarie--",80
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-Port Macquarie-Riv-,80
NA,erwood Village.,80
Mr COWAN,That is right; very good.,80
NA,"Bushland Place now for Taree; Dungog,",80
NA,Stroud and Gloucester. All of those com-,80
NA,munities have gone out of their way to raise,80
NA,money. They have initiated it. Nobody has,80
NA,"said to them, 'You people should have this'.",80
NA,The communities have said this. They have,80
NA,"sought the respect, support and cooperation",80
NA,"of the churches, the masonic lodge or some",80
NA,other body. They are on the way to provid-,80
NA,ing this accommodation. The ladies are cook-,80
NA,ing cakes and the farmers are growing fruit,80
NA,"and vegetables, and providing milk. They are",80
NA,all involved in the fund raising.,80
NA,Mr Ian Robinson-Milk and honey.,80
Mr COWAN,As the honourable member,80
NA,"for Page said, they are providing the milk",80
NA,and honey. Is that not the atmosphere that,80
NA,we have to retain in Australia? This is the,80
NA,bread and butter stuff that the people of this,80
NA,country want. I am sure the honourable,80
NA,member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown),80
NA,would agree with me on this point: the people,80
NA,"want meat, too. They like fillet steak. I know",80
NA,my good friend will help the aged; I have no,80
NA,doubt about that. Those are just some of the,80
NA,comments I wish to make in relation to the,80
NA,legislation. I think they are very basic. If,80
NA,ever we get away from the basics of aged,80
NA,"care, goodness help Australia.",80
NA,NA,80
NA,problem I want to raise tonight in discussing,80
NA,this legislation is the fact that the milk and,80
NA,honey that the honourable member for Lyne,80
NA,( Mr Cowan) talked about will not overcome,80
NA,the problems that some nursing homes in my,80
NA,electorate have as a result of this and related,80
NA,legislation. I particularly want to raise some,80
NA,of the concerns that country people have,80
NA,with the Government's aged care policy.,80
NA,Fundamental to this legislation is the Gov-,80
NA,ernment's move to categorisation of patients,80
NA,for the purpose of funding nursing home,80
NA,residents. The impact of that program will,80
NA,be devastating for a number of country nurs-,80
NA,ing homes unless the program is changed or,80
NA,"amended. In effect, the Government is say-",80
NA,"ing, 'We will assist in funding according to",80
NA,the extent of care required'. No one would,80
NA,argue with that. I well remember the debate,80
NA,last year when the categorisation was being,80
NA,introduced. We on this side of the Parlia-,80
NA,ment raised a number of concerns about its,80
NA,implementation but agreed with the thrust,80
NA,of the proposal. The problems that we fore-,80
NA,cast have now arisen. One of the problems,80
NA,is that the level of funding for each category,80
NA,of patient has been set so that the larger,80
NA,"nursing home, with a patient profile which",80
NA,has a spread across the range of classifica-,80
NA,"tions, will be viable, whereas the smaller",80
NA,homes without that advantage-without the,80
NA,spread of patients from each classification-,80
NA,will suffer a significant reduction in subsidy.,80
NA,I will give a couple of examples from my,80
NA,"electorate. In the town of Berri, which has a",80
NA,"population of 7,000 people, is St Catherine's",80
NA,Home for the Aged. There is a nursing home,80
NA,"with 18 beds and a hostel with 16 beds,",80
NA,catering for the needs of that moderate sized,80
NA,". town of 7,000 people. Under the legislation",80
NA,proposed by this Government it will suffer a,80
NA,"funding cut of up to $86,000. I say to the",80
NA,honourable member for Lyne that the cook-,80
NA,ing of all the cakes in the world will not,80
NA,raise the sort of money that will be cut from,80
NA,"its funding. A town just down the road,",80
NA,"Barmera, has a population of 4,300. It has a",80
NA,"nursing home with 20 beds, adjacent to and",80
NA,run by the hospital in Barmera. Up to,80
NA,"$91,000 will be cut from its budget.",80
NA,"Up the road, the other way, up river to-",80
NA,"wards Canberra, is Renmark, with a popu-",80
NA,"lation of 7,700. Its nursing home has 20 beds",80
NA,and its hostel has 12 beds. It is another small,80
NA,"nursing home, catering for the needs of that",80
NA,community. Those nursing homes are going,80
NA,to suffer under the proposed funding ar-,80
NA,rangements put forward by this Government,80
NA,because they do not have access to a large,80
NA,population and they cannot choose the pa-,80
NA,"tients that come along, to ensure they get a",80
NA,"few category 1 patients, a few category 2",80
NA,"patients, a few from category 3, and so on.",80
NA,They cannot get that spread and so they,81
NA,cannot get the sort of subsidy that the Gov-,81
NA,ernment believes is the norm. It is not the,81
NA,norm in the country. To some extent the,81
NA,Government appears not to have acknowl-,81
NA,edged that because it has put out a paper,81
NA,called Small Nursing Homes. The response,81
NA,in that paper is directed quite clearly to,81
NA,"those smaller nursing homes, especially small",81
NA,country nursing homes. The response from,81
NA,"this Government is, 'Get big or get out'. I",81
NA,will quote from the section entitled 'Over-,81
NA,view of the Proposal'. Paragraph 6 (a) reads:,81
NA,State Offices are to hold discussions with the,81
NA,etors of all small homes to facilitate the amalgama-,81
NA,tion or expansion of these homes.,81
NA,That is it. The State office of the Federal,81
NA,"department will talk to these homes and say,",81
NA,'You've got two options: you get big or you,81
NA,get out'. Let us look at the options. One is,81
NA,for such homes to get big. If one is running,81
NA,"a nursing home in the Riverland, one cannot",81
NA,"get big because the Government says, 'We",81
NA,will not approve any more beds. There are,81
NA,"enough beds in the area now'. In fact, there",81
NA,probably will be a few more-up to 10 more,81
NA,beds by 1996. So what option is one left,81
NA,with? The option is to get out. Is that this,81
NA,Government's policy? What the Government,81
NA,"is saying is, 'You needn't really get out, but",81
NA,you'll have to amalgamate'. That means close,81
NA,one of them and amalgamate with a town,81
NA,"up the river, or down the river in the case",81
NA,of the Riverland.,81
NA,Mr Duncan-Or across the river.,81
NA,NA,81
NA,ment and Education Services is quite right.,81
NA,"For example, one could go across the river",81
NA,in Berri to Loxton. There is a bit of a prob-,81
NA,lem because the South Australian Govern-,81
NA,ment has promised to put a bridge across the,81
NA,"river, but it has failed to come up with the",81
NA,funds. It keeps diverting the funds to yet,81
NA,"another broken promise, to other roadways.",81
NA,They are probably in the Minister's bloomin',81
NA,electorate.,81
NA,Dr Harry Edwards-It is a well repre-,81
NA,sented electorate.,81
NA,NA,81
NA,think the margin has been dropping every,81
NA,election and I suggest that with the candi-,81
NA,date we have got this time around it may,81
NA,well drop to a negative. The Government,81
NA,has identified some of these smaller homes,81
NA,"as falling into a special category, so the first",81
NA,thing I did in relation to a number of these,81
NA,small nursing homes in country areas in my,81
NA,electorate was to see whether they fall into,81
NA,this special category.,81
NA,There are two types of special homes: the,81
NA,"first are remote homes, and the others are",81
NA,what are called other special homes. Remote,81
NA,homes are ones that are a long way from,81
NA,anywhere. They have to range from 100 to,81
NA,"250 kilometres from another home, presum-",81
NA,ably. That just does not apply in my area. It,81
NA,propriprobably applies to Oodnadatta and maybe,81
NA,"Alice Springs, but it does not apply to most",81
NA,country areas in South Australia. The Gov-,81
NA,ernment goes on to say that the definition of,81
NA,'remote' is now being reconsidered with fig-,81
NA,ures as low as 75 kilometres not being en-,81
NA,"tirely excluded. Even so, that will not apply",81
NA,to all the towns I have mentioned here,81
NA,tonight. So they do not fall into the category,81
NA,as currently defined as 'remote'. Are they,81
NA,special homes? Special homes are general,81
NA,purpose homes that cater for people who,81
NA,have cultural and language differences or,81
NA,dietary requirements. Aboriginal and most,81
NA,ethnic homes would meet this criterion. The,81
NA,Berri home has two Aboriginals in it-one,81
NA,in the nursing home and one in the hostel,81
NA,home-but I doubt whether that will fall,81
NA,into the category of a special home. The,81
NA,"Government has provided some exemptions,",81
NA,but they are so limited as to not meet the,81
NA,"need, certainly in country areas in South",81
NA,Australia.,81
NA,"The Government, it seems to me, will",81
NA,have to review the application of these rules,81
NA,and see whether it cannot either amend the,81
NA,exemption categories to broaden them or,81
NA,amend the classification system. Unless the,81
NA,Government is willing to take a more reason-,81
NA,"able, realistic and responsible look at the",81
NA,particular problems of some of these country,81
NA,nursing homes providing care to their com-,81
NA,"munities, the only option, it appears, is to",81
NA,adopt its line of 'Get big or get out'. Is this,81
NA,"a viable, alternative? I have said already that",81
NA,it is not possible under the Government's,81
NA,"rules to get big-for example, in the River-",81
NA,land-because it will not allow the beds. It,81
NA,is a catch 22 situation. Let me read to the,81
NA,House from a letter that I have received,81
NA,from the Barmera Nursing Home which looks,81
NA,at the proposal being put to them by the,82
NA,Government-the 'get big or get out' pro-,82
NA,posal. The letter I have from the director of,82
NA,that nursing home says:,82
NA,The proposal suggests several areas at which small,82
NA,"nursing homes should look, these areas being amal-",82
NA,gamation with another home to increase bed num-,82
NA,"bers, expansion by getting approval to increase bed",82
NA,"numbers, purchase of a home that is closing down-",82
NA,there could be a few of those around with,82
NA,this Government in charge-,82
NA,or closing down our nursing home and selling the,82
NA,beds.,82
NA,We have given these options very careful consid-,82
NA,eration and find that none of these options are,82
NA,"suitable. Firstly, to amalgamate with another home",82
NA,means that we have to relocate one or the other,82
NA,nursing home to one site at significant capital cost.,82
NA,This would result in one of our communities in the,82
NA,Riverland being without a nursing home and there-,82
NA,fore .the elderly residents could no longer continue,82
NA,to live in the towns in which they have grown up.,82
NA,Mr Braithwaite-Is the Government going,82
NA,to contribute to the capital cost?,82
NA,NA,82
NA,tal cost. The letter goes on:,82
NA,To amalgamate and leave the nursing home situ-,82
NA,ated in the present location does not achieve any,82
NA,"significant savings. Also, the grant for which private",82
NA,enterprise home would be eligible for to assist in,82
NA,"amalgamation or expansion of $4,000 per bed is",82
NA,grossly inadequate and does not go anywhere near,82
NA,meeting capital costs involved.,82
NA,I ask the Minister: what is the cost of estab-,82
NA,lishing these new beds? If homes want to,82
NA,"amalgamate, they will have to shut one down",82
NA,and build the beds adjacent to one of the,82
NA,existing homes. I bet the Government cannot,82
NA,"build a bed for $4,000, yet that is the assist-",82
NA,ance it will give homes. The letter further,82
NA,states:,82
NA,"In relation to expansion of nursing home beds, this",82
NA,option would not be supported by your Department,82
NA,as it is currently considered that the Riverland area,82
NA,in which Barmera is located already has too many,82
NA,nursing home beds.,82
NA,That is the point I was making earlier. The,82
NA,letter continues:,82
NA,To purchase a home that is closing down would,82
NA,be a very expensive exercise as I believe nursing,82
NA,"home beds are valued at between $20,000 and $35,000",82
NA,per bed and we would still require Commonwealth,82
NA,approval to have these beds relocated if this was a,82
NA,viable option.,82
NA,That is another route that is closed off by,82
NA,the Government. The letter goes on:,82
NA,In relation to closing the nursing home and selling,82
NA,"our beds, this would result in having to relocate 20",82
NA,nursing home residents to other nursing homes. This,82
NA,would mean residents being accommodated outside,82
NA,of their home towns and would have a significant,82
NA,impact on their families and the quality of life that,82
NA,the resident would be able to lead due to reduced,82
NA,contact with his immediate family. It also leaves us,82
NA,with the situation of having a new building approxi-,82
NA,mately four years old going to waste.,82
NA,The other problem is that if these nursing homes,82
NA,"were to close down, there could be significant impact",82
NA,on the acute beds at local hospitals and this is,82
NA,something that should not be forgotten as the cost,82
NA,of accommodating long term patients in an acute,82
NA,hospital situation is far greater than accommodating,82
NA,them in a nursing home.,82
NA,In that situation the Barmera Nursing Home,82
NA,has looked at the Government's paper and,82
NA,considered what options are open to it. The,82
NA,Government could cut funding by up to,82
NA,"$91,000. What will it do? Will it get big or",82
NA,"get out? It says, 'We have looked at the get",82
NA,big option and we are not allowed to take,82
NA,"that. If we get out, what will we do with",82
NA,our 20 patients? We have a responsibility to,82
NA,them. We don't want to shove them off to,82
NA,another town up or down the river. Even if,82
NA,the residents and the community agreed with,82
NA,"that, how on earth do we fund the shift?'.",82
NA,"As you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker,",82
NA,the Riverland area is up in arms over the,82
NA,Government's proposal. The threat to the,82
NA,homes in that area has been taken very se-,82
NA,riously by the community. There was a meet-,82
NA,ing last week which some 250 people,82
NA,attended. I have received a letter which has,82
NA,also been sent to the Minister for Housing,82
NA,and Aged Care ( Mr Staples). It sets out the,82
NA,"community's concern. Do you know, Mr",82
NA,"Deputy Speaker, that in a couple of days",82
NA,that community got 457 signatures on the,82
NA,letter that was sent to the Minister. That is,82
NA,an indication of the concern about the im-,82
NA,pact of these changes that the Government,82
NA,is making.,82
NA,The resolution of the problem seems to,82
NA,me to be in the Government's hands. It,82
NA,seems that it must take account of the prob-,82
NA,lems of servicing country towns. The Gov-,82
NA,ernment can do that only if it acknowledges,82
NA,that the city model does not fit in the coun-,82
NA,try. The Government has to allow the coun-,82
NA,try nursing homes to continue to operate on,82
NA,a viable basis.,82
NA,"These country nursing homes that I, the",83
NA,honourable member for Lyne and others on,83
NA,this side of the chamber have referred,83
NA,tonight operate with enormous community,83
NA,support. They provide much needed care to ing home viable.,83
NA,our elderly and infirm in country and city,83
NA,areas alike. Country people surely have,83
NA,much right to access to a nursing home within,83
NA,their community as do city people. It is this,83
NA,fundamental right which the Government,83
NA,calling into question with its forced amalChris,83
NA,gamation proposal involving the loss to some,83
NA,communities for their nursing homes. Counwell,83
NA,try people have done a lot for this nation.,83
NA,Right now it is the rural exporters who are,83
NA,"bringing home the bacon, as the Treasurer",83
NA,says. The only thanks they get from this,83
NA,Government is another kick in the teeth.,83
NA,Our road funding has been cut; country,83
NA,"hospital funds have been cut, especially in",83
NA,South Australia where recently we saw the,83
NA,State Government cut funding for the Blyth,83
NA,and Tailem Bend hospitals dramatically;,83
NA,our rail services have been cut. Now the,83
NA,Hawke Labor Government is proposing,83
NA,nificant cuts to nursing home funding to the,83
NA,extent that some will be forced to close,83
NA,down under this amalgamation proposal.,83
NA,Enough is enough. I urge the Minister to,83
NA,review the criteria applying to this area,83
NA,funding. I do not question the goals of this,83
NA,"program, as I said at the beginning of my",83
NA,contribution. Generally we agree with the,83
NA,"overall approach that has been adopted, but",83
NA,the criteria of funding must take into,83
NA,count the differences in population size in,83
NA,"various areas, service delivery and access.",83
NA,They must take into account the differences,83
NA,between city and country to ensure equality,83
NA,of treatment.,83
Mr MCGAURAN ,Gippsland) (9.52)- the,83
NA,"On 26 February this year, a short while ago,",83
NA,I had the honour and privilege of officially,83
NA,opening the refurbished west wing of the,83
NA,Toora nursing home in South Gippsland. This,83
NA,was once a bush nursing hospital that was,83
NA,forced to close in 1984 with the introduction,83
NA,of the insidious Medicare system. But let,83
NA,not dwell on past events; suffice it to,83
NA,local community and committee of manage-,83
NA,"ment had the foresight, wisdom and wit to",83
NA,go about providing a much needed facility,83
NA,for their community. There were already,83
NA,some 14 nursing home beds attached to the,83
NA,Toora bush nursing hospital. On its closure,83
NA,it was sought to add another 16 beds so as,83
NA,to to make up that minimum number of 30,83
NA,nursing home beds necessary to make a nurs-·,83
NA,"To cut a long story short, because there",83
NA,as are a number of aspects of concern to the,83
NA,"Toora nursing home that I wish to touch on,",83
NA,I should only say that it took several years,83
NA,is of resolute determinedness on the part of,83
NA,"Flynn, the secretary-manager, and Mr",83
NA,"Ian Park, the president of the committee, as",83
NA,as all of those on the committee and,83
NA,"those in the wider community, to bring about",83
NA,a reclassification of those empty bush nursing,83
NA,home beds into nursing home beds. There,83
NA,was some capital outlay in converting the,83
NA,west wing of the old bush nursing hospital,83
NA,"into the nursing home. As you, Mr Deputy",83
NA,"Speaker, representing the electorate of Lyne,",83
NA,"mentioned in an earlier speech, these nursing",83
NA,homes can only exist in rural communities,83
NA,and with dedication and support of the commu-,83
NA,nities they seek to serve. The example of the,83
NA,sigToora nursing home bears out your own,83
NA,words. It was not just the work of the com-,83
NA,mittee and the secretary-manager that,83
NA,brought about this wonderful achievement;,83
NA,"it was also the ladies auxilliary, led by the",83
NA,"of president, Mrs Dene Wogan Browne, as well",83
NA,as a contribution made from a coordinating,83
NA,"committee of the adjoining Albertan shire,",83
NA,headed by Mrs Val Niggl. I understand also,83
NA,that the Toora Lions Club played a part in,83
NA,acfitting out the nursing home extensions.,83
NA,Toora's opening took place amongst a great,83
NA,deal of debate about the future accommo-,83
NA,dation for the elderly in our society. It seems,83
NA,to me that what is at issue is how to best,83
NA,direct government resources to the care of,83
NA,aged so that individuals are best served,83
NA,according to their respective needs. In addi-,83
NA,"tion, it is also important to lay the founda-",83
NA,tion of a lasting system of care which will,83
NA,be sufficiently flexible and sensitive to meet,83
NA,the changing and growing needs of a popu-,83
NA,lation which is rapidly ageing. It is vital to,83
NA,me build a system of care for the aged which,83
NA,say the will be able to cope with change.,83
NA,Like most mature Western societies Aus-,83
NA,tralia is undergoing a transformation in its,83
NA,age structure. As a population we are getting,83
NA,older. There are many reasons why this is,83
NA,happening. For the most part the cause of,83
NA,this marked trend in ageing is that the deised,84
NA,cline in birth rate over past decades is taking,84
NA,place against the background of normally,84
NA,"high periods of fertility at the mid-century,",84
NA,particularly in the post-war years which,84
NA,become known as the baby boom period.,84
NA,"Moreover, the benefits of modern medicine",84
NA,an- -echnology with our increased quality of,84
NA,life has seen an increase in life expectancy.,84
NA,The statistical implications of these trends,84
NA,are dramatic. The number of people aged 60,84
NA,years and over is expected to rise from,84
NA,million in 1981 to three million by the year,84
NA,"2001 and to five million by the year 2021,",84
NA,meaning that 22 per cent of our population,84
NA,will be aged over 60 by the year 2021.,84
NA,These statistics are very real for governsame,84
NA,ments as they consider how best to plan,84
NA,the care of the elderly into the next century.,84
NA,Between 1981 and 2001 the increase in,84
NA,aged population will mean that governments,84
NA,will have to increase their outlays on the,84
NA,elderly by 131 per cent. This will mean a,84
NA,per cent rise in government outlays in real,84
NA,terms between 2000 and 2021. Already,84
NA,third of the health and welfare budget,84
NA,"spent on the elderly, which works out to be",84
NA,"some $3,781 for each individual. I might add",84
NA,that on the current numbers 14 per cent of,84
NA,our population falls within the category,84
NA,elderly. The demand on government expendnity,84
NA,iture will be increased by still another factor.,84
NA,The current decline in the birth rate will,84
NA,mean a reduction in the tax base in future.,84
NA,"The lowering of expenditure on the young,",84
NA,"owing to their decrease in numbers, will not",84
NA,be anywhere near enough to cover the,84
NA,crease in outlays for the increasing number,84
NA,of elderly.,84
NA,The task for governments is very real. Not,84
NA,only do we have to ensure that the economy,84
NA,grows in order to provide for the funds neceach,84
NA,essary to maintain a viable system for the,84
NA,elderly but we need also to look closely,84
NA,how we can make the system of care more,84
NA,effective by better directing resources whilst hostels.,84
NA,at the same time ensuring every aged person,84
NA,receives a level of support appropriate,84
NA,"their medical, social and emotional needs.",84
NA,To achieve this end I think it is necessary,84
NA,have regard to a number of basic principles.,84
NA,"In the first instance the elderly should,",84
NA,"appropriate, be supported in their own",84
NA,and in their own communities. Institutionalknown,84
NA,"care, whether it be in hostels or homes",84
NA,"such as the Toora nursing home, should only",84
NA,be relied upon when no other style of accom-,84
NA,modation suits the needs of the individual.,84
NA,"have Nursing home care, as you would know bet-",84
NA,"ter than anyone, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the",84
NA,highest and most important level of care,84
NA,available but is also the most expensive.,84
NA,On 1987 figures-the most recent avail-,84
NA,"able-there were 68,642 beds in nursing",84
NA,homes nationally. The recurrent expenditure,84
NA,two for the same year for nursing homes was,84
NA,$1.1 billion. Assuming each bed available,84
NA,"represents an individual, this makes for a",84
NA,"Commonwealth outlay of $16,439.50 per res-",84
NA,"ident. By way of contrast, hostel care for the",84
NA,"year represents an outlay of $1,727.26",84
NA,"for per person, making 38,800 resident places",84
NA,"against recurrent outlays of $67,028,000.",84
NA,the While I am in sympathy with the general,84
NA,trend towards a diversification of the levels,84
NA,"of care available to the elderly, it must be",84
NA,50 said that diversification has its pitfalls.,84
NA,Change can be seized upon too impetuously,84
NA,oneand imbalances can quickly occur in the,84
NA,is provision of vital services.,84
NA,The present Government believes that it,84
NA,is necessary to reduce the past emphasis on,84
NA,"funding for nursing homes and, instead, build",84
NA,of up the resources of the hostel and commu-,84
NA,based support systems. Increased fund-,84
NA,ing for hostels will mean that between 1989,84
NA,"and 1991 some 12,300 new hostel places will",84
NA,"be established nationally against only 1,400",84
NA,nursing home beds for the same period. To,84
NA,"emphasise this trend in other terms, the Gov-",84
NA,inernment aims to provide 100 residential,84
NA,"places per 1,000 members of the population",84
NA,aged over 70 years. To' achieve the goal of,84
NA,"diversification, the Government is seeking to",84
NA,achieve a mix of 40 nursing' home places for,84
NA,60 hostel places by early next century.,84
NA,This will mean that only 10 per cent of new,84
NA,at places allocated in the future will be for,84
NA,nursing homes; the remainder will be for,84
NA,For us in Victoria this means that between,84
NA,to now and 1992 only 544 new nursing home,84
NA,"places will be established, whilst 4,814 hostel",84
NA,to places will be created. The implications of,84
NA,this policy are only too obvious. Indicative,84
NA,"when of the same reallocation of resources, the",84
NA,"homes home and community care scheme, better",84
NA,"as HACC, received in excess of an",84
NA,"additional $100m between 1985 and 1988,",85
NA,being roughly a 50 per cent increase in fund-,85
NA,ing within a three-year period. Managing,85
NA,change on this scale and ensuring the main-,85
NA,tenance of standards of care gives rise to,85
NA,problems of enormous complexity and pres-,85
NA,ent governments with significant challenges.,85
NA,Yet these are challenges that the Govern-,85
NA,ment must take up.,85
NA,If it were not of such practical significance,85
NA,I would have been embarrassed to talk of,85
NA,"care for the elderly in the terms that I have,",85
NA,"of dull statistics and so forth. As a rule, the",85
NA,elderly ought to be spoken of in terms of,85
NA,"compassion and respect, and that ought to",85
NA,"be enough to drive the system on. Moreover,",85
NA,I am uneasy at having referred to the aged,85
NA,"in such general terms. After all, the care",85
NA,services I have outlined are designed to re-,85
NA,cognise the very diversity of the elderly.,85
NA,ing does not necessarily mean entry into a,85
NA,period of disadvantage and dependency. That,85
NA,is a myth. The facts of old age are that it is,85
NA,"a fulfilling stage of life, a period in which",85
NA,individuals and couples might find new ways,85
NA,to continue to make contributions to the,85
NA,family and to the community in however,85
NA,modest a way. The ability to contribute and,85
NA,to feel that life is still valuable depends on,85
NA,"the opportunities we provide, the doors we",85
NA,_leave open which will enable the elderly to,85
NA,"exploit further their skills, talents and",85
NA,ests which have developed over a lifetime.,85
NA,The principles I have outlined are at risk,85
NA,in many nursing homes in Victoria. Let me,85
NA,take as an example of the callousness of,85
NA,some aspects of the Government's new sys-,85
NA,tem the Toora nursing home. Under the new,85
NA,"system, new residents will be classified ac-",85
NA,"cording to the severity of their disability,",85
NA,"categories 1, 2 and 3 being the most in need",85
NA,"of direct and constant care, categories 4 and",85
NA,5 requiring less care. Under the care aggre-,85
NA,"gate module (CAM), subsidies are paid to",85
NA,nursing homes in relation to the cost per,85
NA,staff hour of providing nursing home care.,85
NA,On this basis a category 1 patient receives,85
NA,"27 nursing care hours per week, category 2",85
NA,"receives 23t hours, category 3 receives 20",85
NA,"hours, category 4 receives 13 hours and cat-",85
NA,egory 5 receives 10 hours. One can see the,85
NA,decreasing scale of nursing care provided ac-,85
NA,cording to the category. The actual subsidy,85
NA,"that a nursing home receives varies, however,",85
NA,according to the relative costs of nursing and,85
NA,so forth in each State. In Victoria a category,85
NA,1 patient attracts a subsidy of $67.60 while,85
NA,a category 5 resident attracts a subsidy of,85
NA,"only $25.57. In contrast, the standard aggre-",85
NA,gate module (SAM) provides for a fixed and,85
NA,uniform subsidy according to a government-,85
NA,determined standard required to meet infras-,85
NA,tructure costs.,85
NA,There are many problems with this ap-,85
NA,proach to financing the residential dimension,85
NA,of the aged care policy of the Government.,85
NA,"Firstly, the Government's policies represent",85
NA,a barely disguised attack on the private nurs-,85
NA,ing home sector of the aged care system. The,85
NA,Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr,85
NA,"Staples) has no sympathy, no understanding,",85
NA,no tolerance and certainly no proper attitude,85
NA,toward private sector nursing homes. The,85
NA,Age- policy of this Government will simply re-,85
NA,quire private nursing homes to reduce their,85
NA,commitments to providing care to a broad,85
NA,band of patients in need of close care and,85
NA,"supervision. Moreover, the Government sys-",85
NA,tem suffers from rigidity in its application,85
NA,and is based on a dangerous assumption about,85
NA,the uniformity of the residential care system.,85
NA,"In my own electorate, Gippsland, one",85
NA,community has struggled to raise the funds,85
NA,to reconstruct a one-time bush nursing hos-,85
NA,pital and refashion it into a high standard,85
NA,interprivate nursing home. I refer to the refur-,85
NA,"bished Toora nursing home. Sadly, despite",85
NA,the happiness of the official opening on 26,85
NA,"February, the Toora nursing home faces a",85
NA,bleak future owing to the Government's in-,85
NA,sensitive and dogmatic approach to nursing,85
NA,home funding. Like many private nursing,85
NA,"homes, the Toora nursing home has found",85
NA,"that the funding mechanism, CAM, simply",85
NA,cannot ensure that it can provide the quality,85
NA,"of care needed by its residents. In practice,",85
NA,it knows that the health of a particular pa-,85
NA,tient fluctuates on an almost day to day,85
NA,basis. It knows that the level of care-this is,85
NA,crucial-and therefore the level of staffing is,85
NA,never stable and that in matters like this it,85
NA,is vital to have staff on hand.,85
NA,"The Minister for Housing and Aged Care,",85
NA,who is at the table to take charge of this,85
NA,"legislation, must answer this fundamental",85
NA,misconception on the part of the Govern-,85
NA,ment. Nursing care for the aged is not static,85
NA,"or rigid. In addition, the Secretary-Manager,",85
NA,"Mr Chris Flynn, the Director of Nursing,",86
NA,"Elaine Scott, and the Deputy Director of",86
NA,"Nursing, Sissel Leorke, have found that CAM",86
NA,does not accommodate the particular needs,86
NA,of a rural community. Unlike nursing homes,86
NA,"in urban areas, which have access to consid-",86
NA,erable capital and a fixed and concentrated,86
NA,"supply of residents, the Toora nursing home",86
NA,has had to make do with considerably more,86
NA,humble resources.,86
NA,"As I said earlier, the Toora nursing home",86
NA,is really grafted on to a bush nursing hospi-,86
NA,tal. It was a community effort based upon,86
NA,funds largely raised locally and it was de-,86
NA,signed to meet a pressing community need.,86
NA,But the physical constraints of the refur-,86
NA,bished nursing home are poorly understood,86
NA,by the system the Government wishes to,86
NA,impose upon the community. The Toora,86
NA,nursing home requires three night staff to,86
NA,meet its needs. Instead of being built in a,86
NA,"figure eight shape or in the shape of a square,",86
NA,both of which designs permit a high degree,86
NA,of supervision by way of a central nursing,86
NA,"centre, the former bush hospital is limited by",86
NA,"its history, in order to maximise the safety",86
NA,"and well-being of its residents, to a minimum",86
NA,of three night staff on duty. If two are re-,86
NA,quired to lift a patient at one end of the,86
NA,home which regrettably is built in a straight,86
NA,"line, another must be in attendance at the",86
NA,other end of the hospital. But the resident,86
NA,classification index does not permit staffing,86
NA,at this level. It does not permit the particular,86
NA,needs of the physical history of the nursing,86
NA,"home to determine its staffing needs. And,",86
NA,"by so doing, the rigidity of the funding mech-",86
NA,anism I have outlined places the residents in,86
NA,jeopardy. This is even more apparent when,86
NA,I bring to the House's attention that' there,86
NA,are four or five patients suffering from de-,86
NA,mentia in the home. Constant supervision is,86
NA,therefore a priority in an environment of this,86
NA,sort.,86
NA,The particular characteristics of the local,86
NA,community also mitigate against the imposi-,86
NA,tion of uniform funding arrangements sought,86
NA,by the Government. Unlike the homes in the,86
NA,"urban centres, the Toora Nursing home does",86
NA,not have a steady waiting list of residents,86
NA,who will assume the status of category 1 or,86
NA,2 patients. The home will not therefore have,86
NA,a steady provision of subsidy at the highest,86
NA,level. This causes difficulties in that there are,86
NA,"patients, such as the dementia patients, who",86
NA,"require a great deal of supervision, but who",86
NA,cannot be adequately taken care of in hostel,86
NA,type accommodation. The finances of the,86
NA,home are therefore placed in extreme diffi-,86
NA,cultyas the bulk of their residents have been,86
NA,classified as category 4 or 5 and therefore,86
NA,attract the lowest level of funding-a disin-,86
NA,centive designed to weed out patients of this,86
NA,kind and force them into hostel accommo-,86
NA,dation which does not suit their needs.,86
NA,This has given rise to another problem.,86
NA,Though residents might not in some cases be,86
NA,strictly suited to a nursing home environ-,86
NA,"ment, where can they go to when they live",86
NA,in rural or isolated areas? They do not have,86
NA,at their disposal the virtually unlimited re-,86
NA,sources of the cities. Is it intended that they,86
NA,uproot themselves from the communities in,86
NA,"which they have grown up, in which they",86
NA,have raised families and grown old? Is this,86
NA,the intention of the legislation? The problem,86
NA,is so critical for the Toora Nursing Home as,86
NA,it struggles to meet the needs of its commu-,86
NA,nity that it has already transferred over,86
NA,"$30,000 from its capital budget to its oper-",86
NA,ating budget in order to keep the home sol-,86
NA,vent. And the problem is getting worse. It,86
NA,has a waiting list of predominantly category,86
NA,4 and 5 patients who require more care than,86
NA,a hostel can provide them but who cannot,86
NA,live in the community any longer by them-,86
NA,selves. The Government needs to address the,86
NA,needs of the Toora Nursing Home.,86
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Cowan)-,86
NA,Order! The honourable member's time has,86
NA,expired.,86
Mr IAN ROBINSON ,Page) (10.12)-,86
NA,The Government has moved in haste to im-,86
NA,plement measures to require the care of the,86
NA,aged to be administered on .a needs basis.,86
NA,Those words would seem to express a fairly,86
NA,"straightforward and, no doubt, to those who",86
NA,have no real knowledge of care of the aged,86
NA,"in nursing homes and hostels, a reasonable",86
NA,proposition. We have a circumstance in which,86
NA,the Government has moved not just in haste,86
NA,but really in stealth. It has changed drasti-,86
NA,cally the guidelines with little opportunity,86
NA,for the community to become aware of its,86
NA,"intentions, to understand the import and to",86
NA,be able to comprehend what is really occur-,86
NA,ring. There is always a need to change a,86
NA,system that has been in operation for a long,86
NA,"time-to update, to meet the trends of the",87
NA,time and so on. But what we have in this,87
NA,legislation and the measures previously intro-,87
NA,duced by way of regulation and by way of,87
NA,decision of the Government is nothing more,87
NA,or less than an iron-clad directive to all those,87
NA,"who have been participants, who have",87
NA,"work-ed for years, in many instances, to cre-",87
NA,"ate a system providing care for the aged, on",87
NA,a basis of a direct relationship between units,87
NA,"for aged persons, hostels and a nursing home.",87
NA,"On the north coast of New South Wales,·",87
NA,there is a very substantial demand for care,87
NA,because of the proportion of aged in the,87
NA,community. I have had close and long expe-,87
NA,rience with the work that has been under-,87
NA,"taken there by recognised institutions, public",87
NA,committees and bodies that have been re-,87
NA,sponsible for the creation of a chain of nurs-,87
NA,"ing home and hostel facilities, which are of",87
NA,the highest possible standard. That has been,87
NA,done with the tremendous support of the,87
NA,community and with fund raising referred to,87
NA,by my colleagues who have spoken including,87
NA,the honourable member for Lyne ( Mr,87
NA,Cowan) and the honourable member for,87
NA,"Cowper ( Mr Nehl). Of course, also from",87
NA,"this side of the House, the honourable mem-",87
NA,ber for Dawson ( Mr Braithwaite) very clearly,87
NA,stated some of the important considerations,87
NA,of this legislation.,87
NA,The Government is overlooking the fact,87
NA,that it is all very well to create a blue-print,87
NA,and to try meticulously to spell this matter,87
NA,out on a theoretical basis. It is another mat-,87
NA,ter for it to be put effectively into practice.,87
NA,We see an untidy mix between the important,87
NA,element of capital funding and the subse-,87
NA,quent requirement for maintenance funding.,87
NA,Hence the determinations that they should,87
NA,"get big and then get out, as referred to by",87
NA,my colleague from South Australia the,87
NA,NA,87
NA,the impact of that on existing homes and,87
NA,institutions and the danger it poses for the,87
NA,future in the requirements to provide ade-,87
NA,quately across the community in terms of,87
NA,"aged care facilities, straight accommodation",87
NA,hostels and nursing homes.,87
NA,It is all very well to say that there is a,87
NA,great need to move from' the submission,87
NA,model that was so clearly understood by the,87
NA,community for so long. This concept was,87
NA,introduced in the Menzies Government by,87
NA,the late Sir Earle Page as Minister for Health .,87
NA,who provided enormous leadership in this,87
NA,"field a very long time ago. In my area today,",87
NA,there are still one or two homes that were,87
NA,built as a direct result of his energetic ap7,87
NA,proach at that time to make it possible for,87
NA,capital funding to be provided and to set the,87
NA,starting point for the establishment of effec-,87
NA,"tive care of the aged. This, to a large extent,",87
NA,is to be jettisoned under this new direction,87
NA,proposition. They are indeed new directions.,87
NA,The administration of homes for the aged in,87
NA,both nursing homes and hostels is becoming,87
NA,a nightmare because the maintenance fund-,87
NA,ing is now being provided on a basis referred,87
NA,to clearly in this debate by some of my,87
NA,colleagues-this is without question-that is,87
NA,hampering the day to day operation of the,87
NA,system. There is no clear and definitive an-,87
NA,swer in overcoming the problems that have,87
NA,arisen.,87
NA,The Minister for Housing and Aged Care,87
NA,( Mr Staples) has not been very closely in-,87
NA,volved in this debate. I hope that tomorrow,87
NA,he answers many of the questions that have,87
NA,been raised-and answers them in a clear,87
NA,and understandable fashion. One of the first,87
NA,matters that I hope he clears up is the ques-,87
NA,tion of pushing out the private nursing homes.,87
NA,"Obviously, it is a determination by the Gov-",87
NA,ernment that they should be squeezed out.,87
NA,"If that is to be the agenda, I want to know",87
NA,how the projected future creation of facilities,87
NA,will cater for all of the needs that are so,87
NA,"obvious, if one makes an assessment of the",87
NA,communities and the proportion of aged per-,87
NA,"sons, and the percentages so dramatically",87
NA,outlined by the honourable member for,87
NA,Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran). It is a challenge,87
NA,that must be met in this day and age. We,87
NA,"do not want it to be met by gross waste and,",87
NA,"by failure to have effective administration,",87
NA,effective Government oversight and all the,87
NA,rest. But we do not want it to be so admin-,87
NA,istered that we get down to the incredible,87
NA,process that there is a Star Chamber process,87
NA,to determine who will get the benefits and,87
NA,how they will get those benefits. The con-,87
NA,tents of this legislation does just that.,87
NA,It is a very great worry to the medical,87
NA,"profession in many parts of Australia, cer-",87
NA,"tainly in my own electorate, and it is a very",87
NA,great worry to the administrators of existing,87
NA,health services to find that the restrictions,87
NA,that are envisaged will in fact create very,88
NA,great difficulties in giving advice to families,88
NA,when a family member. becomes aged and is,88
NA,no longer in a state of health that can be,88
NA,regarded as safe for home care. We will not,88
NA,have the facilities. We may well find that an,88
NA,impossible situation will be created where,88
NA,families cannot find an answer to that prob-,88
NA,lem. They can go back to their local medico,88
NA,who can say that a particular person should,88
NA,"be in a nursing home, but the committee",88
NA,that will determine whether that is so may,88
NA,well say that there is no case. So what hap-,88
NA,pens? You get great trauma and the situa-,88
NA,"tion in which home care, even the visitations,",88
NA,which is a service that is provided in most,88
NA,"communities these days to assist, by all sorts",88
NA,"of trained people, will not adequately cover",88
NA,the need.,88
NA,This occurs for a very obvious reason.,88
NA,"Unless we have the impetus, which was al-",88
NA,"ways part and parcel of the system, where",88
NA,funds are raised by communities able to do,88
NA,this-and when that was done the Govern-,88
NA,ment was prepared to come forth with its,88
NA,share of the capital requirement to establish,88
NA,facilities-we are going to have a circum-,88
NA,stance in which the community will not be,88
NA,"supporting, as it has in the past, the capital",88
NA,provision. Maybe that is a saving for the,88
NA,"Government in the long term, because there",88
NA,is less of a financial requirement in terms of,88
NA,"maintenance, but what does that do for the",88
NA,needy? What does that do for the commu-,88
NA,nities that expect to have adequate provi-,88
NA,"sion? The answer from the Government is,",88
NA,"'Oh, here are the statistics. We are going to",88
NA,provide X number of beds for X number of,88
NA,aged people in' every community'. Where,88
NA,does that fall to the ground? It falls to the,88
NA,ground because the geographical locations,88
NA,set out for the various regions are not prac-',88
NA,tical. They are not practical because they,88
NA,just take into account local government areas,88
NA,and regions without regard to the nature of,88
NA,those communities in terms of the people,88
NA,who live there. They disregard distance and,88
NA,"community of interest, and they do not re-",88
NA,cognise the obvious overlapping there is when,88
NA,a region has to look at the delineation of its,88
NA,local government boundaries.,88
NA,I want to explain why this is sheer non-,88
NA,sense. Unless you have a relationship be-,88
NA,tween the provision of nursing homes and,88
NA,hostels and the availability of medical serv-,88
NA,"ices, ambulance services and many other",88
NA,"things that aged people need, they are left",88
NA,really in isolation. It does not work. If we,88
NA,"go back just a short time span, there was the",88
NA,advent of the concept that a nursing home,88
NA,and a hostel should be of a particular size,88
NA,and that it was an advantage if it had some,88
NA,"relationship to an existing institution, proba-",88
NA,bly a hospital that had a modern kitchen,88
NA,"and modern laundry, and it could share those",88
NA,facilities. I can quote examples at Macksville,88
NA,in the electorate of Cowper-my colleague,88
NA,the honourable member for Cowper knows,88
NA,this location very well-and at Grafton in,88
NA,my own electorate and so the list would go,88
NA,on if one were to name all the locations.,88
NA,The relationship between a public hospital,88
NA,"in terms of its kitchens, laundries and so on",88
NA,and a nursing home or hostel has been a,88
NA,pretty good proposition. But now that is not,88
NA,really regarded any longer as significant. The,88
NA,idea now is that one just looks at the statis-,88
NA,tics. The people in the local government,88
NA,areas do not even try to work out how that,88
NA,fits into the overall community pattern and,88
NA,"say, 'This is how we are going to do it'. I",88
NA,believe that is. simply a blueprint for disaster,88
NA,in the long term.,88
NA,There is a need for a different kind of,88
NA,provision in a variety of locations. We have,88
NA,heard from South Australia and Victoria,88
NA,about the problem of bush hospitals and,88
NA,small institutions. In parts of New South,88
NA,Wales there is a similar circumstance. The,88
NA,honourable member for Riverina-Darling ( Mr,88
NA,Hicks) referred to that circumstance. In the,88
NA,more heavily populated areas of the coast,88
NA,the circumstances are totally different. The,88
NA,creation of the larger related community style,88
NA,"facilities for the aged there, is much more",88
NA,"appropriate-units, hostels and a nearby",88
NA,nursing home-so that there can be a blend,88
NA,of the facilities and the services and a means,88
NA,of administration that is practical. The en-,88
NA,couragement of local support to enable that,88
NA,to work and be ongoing has not been recog-,88
NA,nised under this legislation in a practical,88
NA,way. The community is really in the dark as,88
NA,to what the ultimate procedure for encour-,88
NA,agement and support will be. All the local,88
NA,communities know is the kind of answer that,88
NA,one of my colleagues earlier this evening,88
NA,read in response to a letter written by a local,88
NA,committee seeking advice as to the steps that,89
NA,should be taken in order to have facilities,89
NA,created in that particular locality. I have,89
NA,received similar letters. The detail contained,89
NA,in the letters might be very clear to those,89
NA,who sent out the correspondence for the,89
NA,Minister and might be very clear to the,89
NA,"Department, but it does not tell the local",89
NA,people a darn thing. As far as the local,89
NA,"member is concerned, he is usually the last",89
NA,to know these days what is going on. I want,89
NA,to say to the Minister that that is a sorry,89
NA,state of affairs. It does not matter which side,89
NA,of the House one is on. Over the years this,89
NA,has always been a bipartisan process. Homes,89
NA,for the aged have not been a matter of,89
NA,"playing politics. If it is to trend that way, it",89
NA,is a pretty sorry state of affairs. I believe,89
NA,that members of this House have not been,89
NA,adequately informed by the Minister. There,89
NA,has been no general advice and no letter that,89
NA,"says, 'This is the new system, this is how it",89
NA,is going to operate'. We all have to go cap,89
NA,in hand to someone and start asking a lot of,89
NA,questions to find out what is happening in,89
NA,our electorates. I believe that applies to,89
NA,members on both sides of the House. So I,89
NA,say to the Minister that when he responds,89
NA,to the debate later he should particularly,89
NA,take on board the significance of that.,89
NA,"In the moment or two that is left to me,",89
NA,I want to say that the Minister might also,89
NA,"give some update on the press statement,",89
NA,which he issued in response to the report on,89
NA,"the operation of nursing homes, it has caused",89
NA,a great deal of concern to excellent nursing,89
NA,"homes throughout Australia which, it is sug-",89
NA,"gested, are under scrutiny in that they have",89
NA,not been doing their job. I believe that is a,89
NA,very unsatisfactory situation. There have been,89
NA,44 proposals mooted apparently in terms of,89
NA,how institutions should in future be run.,89
NA,Forty-four major reforms have been recom-,89
NA,mended; How can one have those reforms,89
NA,and at the same time have the financial,89
NA,provisions so restricted under the legislation,89
NA,before the House that administrators are at,89
NA,their wits' end to keep their particular insti-,89
NA,tution functioning?,89

NA,question:,89
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,89
Mr TIM FISCHER ,Farrer)(10.30)-,89
NA,Tonight I want to salute two countries of,89
NA,"quite different extremes, namely Bhutan and",89
NA,Bangladesh. I do so quite deliberately as part,89
NA,of a pro-Asian strategy to build up our po-,89
NA,"litical, cultural and economic links with Asia,",89
NA,as the Federal member for Farrer and shadow,89
NA,Minister for veterans' affairs and on behalf,89
NA,of the coalition for its own part as it recog-,89
NA,nises where our future lies.,89
NA,I had the privilege of being perhaps the,89
NA,first member of the Australian Parliament to,89
NA,"visit Bhutan, located as it is between India",89
NA,"and Tibet, during the recent summer recess.",89
NA,It is one kingdom that values its rich and,89
NA,colourful heritage and it has taken positive,89
NA,"steps to retain· that heritage, despite some",89
NA,limited modernisation and some modest in-,89
NA,crease in tourism. It has a very popular,89
NA,"King, who is a determined young man who",89
NA,". lives quite modestly and who has recently,",89
NA,"through Bhutan's judicial system, been quite",89
NA,relaxed about seeing one or two Ministers go,89
NA,"to gaol who were involved with corruption,",89
NA,so determined is he to see that his kingdom,89
NA,is not corrupt and does not go down the,89
NA,path of other kingdoms which have suffered,89
NA,"from a great deal of corruption, especially",89
NA,"flowing from foreign aid. Indeed, Bhutan",89
NA,hesitates to take on foreign aid. It is very,89
NA,conscious that it can absorb only a degree of,89
NA,foreign aid and it quite often rejects sugges-,89
NA,tions from countries wanting to give it for-,89
NA,"eign aid, to make sure that it does retain its",89
NA,balance and culture in a sensible way.,89
NA,Australia enjoys very good relations with,89
NA,Bhutan and has a modest foreign aid pro-,89
NA,"gram, including merino sheep breeding at",89
NA,"10,000 feet-plus on the slopes of the Hima-",89
NA,layas. It was certainly a very rare privilege,89
NA,to have visited Bhutan and to see the state,89
NA,of relations between it and Australia and to,89
NA,see Australian aid workers in many and var-,89
NA,"ied situations of some considerable hardship,",90
NA,carrying out their duties. To all of that I,90
NA,would simply add one tip to those who might,90
NA,be seeking to go to Bhutan: beware of arrows,90
NA,"overhead, because archery is still very popu-",90
NA,lar; it abounds. When I walked out of a,90
NA,"particular ruined dzong, or castle, I heard a",90
NA,swish in the air and looked up and realised,90
NA,that I had walked straight into the middle of,90
NA,a target range for the local archery practice.,90
NA,On the ides of March next week-on 15,90
NA,March-Bhutan will in one sense move closer,90
NA,to Australia when direct flights start from,90
NA,"Bangkok to Paro, just near the capital Thim-",90
NA,"phu by Druk Air, flying a BAe146, linking",90
NA,up with Thai Airways International and/or,90
NA,Qantas. I think a greater interest in Bhutan,90
NA,will be taken by people in Australia. Bhutan,90
NA,is an independent member of the South East,90
NA,Asian community group of nations and a,90
NA,free voting member of the United Nations,90
NA,and one which Australia should continue to,90
NA,"build up its relations with, notwithstanding",90
NA,the fact that it is a small country with only,90
NA,just. over one million people. But I say again,90
NA,it is a colourful country with a rich heritage,90
NA,and one that it was a privilege to visit.,90
NA,"I turn to the second country, Bangladesh.",90
NA,I am delighted to say that there are two,90
NA,"areas of great tranquillity in Bangladesh, and",90
NA,I refer to the war cemeteries at Comilla and,90
NA,"Chittagong, out on the eastern side of the",90
NA,"Bangladesh, which I visited in my capacity",90
NA,as shadow Minister for veterans' affairs. Not-,90
NA,"withstanding all the turmoil of Bangladesh,",90
NA,"the cyclones, the floods of last year, the",90
NA,"derailments and the horrific tragedies, be-",90
NA,cause its population is some 110 million and,90
NA,"the moment anything goes wrong, it always",90
NA,"seems to go very badly wrong, those two war",90
NA,"cemeteries, containing the graves of over",90
NA,"1,400 allied Service personnel, including many",90
NA,Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air,90
NA,"Force personnel, are in excellent order. I am",90
NA,delighted to report that much to the House.,90
NA,In passing I mention my concern at the,90
NA,prospect that the Office of Australian War,90
NA,Graves may be under some review. I would,90
NA,be totally opposed to any abolition of the,90
NA,Office of Australian War Graves. I think it,90
NA,would cut across the intent of this Parlia-,90
NA,ment to see that proper maintenance is car-,90
NA,"ried out on all war graves, especially",90
NA,Australian war graves in Australia or Asia.,90
NA,Certainly there are problems in Bangla-,90
NA,desh and there are problems with the aid,90
NA,programs and the direction and focus of those,90
NA,aid programs. Clearly that needs to be more,90
NA,clearly monitored.,90
NA,"Finally, I salute those Australians who",90
NA,"serve this country, be they with the aid pro-",90
NA,grams or with the Department of Foreign,90
NA,"Affairs and Trade, in such countries as Bhu-",90
NA,tan and Bangladesh. They are not easy post-,90
NA,ings. They serve their country well and they,90
NA,deserve credit for their work.,90
NA,NA,90
NA,Federal member for Adelaide people often,90
NA,ask me if I enjoy my job. My reply to them,90
NA,is that I love it. I think I understand what,90
NA,politics and Parliament are about and the,90
NA,learning process which this adjournment de-,90
NA,"bate affords me. Last Thursday, as I con-",90
NA,cluded my speech on the Aged or Disabled,90
NA,Persons Homes Amendment Bill-a very,90
NA,sensitive and important issue-I stayed in the,90
NA,House to listen to the adjournment debate.,90
NA,Imagine my surprise when the honourable,90
NA,member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Sawford),90
NA,"hauled himself to his feet, not to speak on",90
NA,the fall of living standards and high interest,90
NA,rates which are crippling his constituents in,90
NA,"Westlakes, or perhaps to deliver his view on",90
NA,pornographic videos or the value of the sub-,90
NA,"marine corporation, but to chop me up for",90
NA,daring to do something about the plight of,90
NA,our elderly. He referred to me attending a,90
NA,"senior citizens rally in Adelaide last week,",90
NA,trying to portray that marvellous group of,90
NA,concerned taxpayers who have been ne-,90
NA,glected and rejected and now feel dejected,90
NA,by this out of touch government. The,90
NA,honourable member for Port Adelaide was,90
NA,very qualified to speak about this rally in,90
NA,light of the fact that he did not even bother,90
NA,to attend it! Along with the honourable,90
NA,"member for Hawker ( Mrs Harvey), I joined",90
NA,"the 5,000 who marched from Victoria Square",90
NA,"to Elder Park in that century-plus heat, and",90
NA,it is a wonder more did not keel over. The,90
NA,honourable member for Port Adelaide pro-,90
NA,"ceeds to lambaste the Liberals, Greypower,",90
NA,"one of my staff, and whoever else gets in the",90
NA,way of his vitriolic tongue. But his source of,90
NA,"information came from that great periodical,",90
NA,"the Herald, the Australian Labor Party's toe",90
NA,rag produced in Adelaide. On a front page,90
NA,was a big spread by the honourable member,90
NA,"for Hawker, and on the back page an article",91
NA,by a David Harvey on retirement incomes,91
NA,entitled 'Watch This Greypower Group'.,91
NA,The honourable member for Port Adelaide,91
NA,"quoted directly from this piece of gutter press,",91
NA,where it is fair game to attack not only a,91
NA,member of my staff but also Mrs Jessie Tay-,91
NA,"lor, President of the 5,000 strong Senior Cit-",91
NA,izens of Australia. She is not a member of,91
NA,"the Liberal Party, as quoted by the honour-",91
NA,able member. He is also having a go at,91
NA,"Adelaide's Lord Mayor, Steve Condous, who",91
NA,is the group's patron. If we turn the page of,91
NA,this magazine we find four Labor candidates,91
NA,who are currently staffers for State and Fed-,91
NA,"eral politicians-a typical arrogant attitude,",91
NA,whereby concerned people in the community,91
NA,"are seeking to assist our seniors groups, but",91
NA,"if someone is a Labor staffer, well that is",91
NA,different in their socialist eyes.,91
NA,But then the picture gets a bit clearer.,91
NA,Labor's secretariat has put its campaign,91
NA,strategy into gear and called up its Adelaide,91
NA,"heavyweight, the man elected to fill Mick",91
NA,Young's shoes. Remember Mick Young? He,91
NA,did a runner from Parliament when he lost,91
NA,the axe and the cheque in the woodchip,91
NA,"affair, so the head kicker from Port Adelaide",91
NA,"is called in to do a number on me, the",91
NA,"member for Adelaide, to try to discredit me",91
NA,so that Labor can get a bit of a run for Bib,91
NA,"Catley, its Moscow and Warsaw trained ac-",91
NA,"ademic, the scuba diving, luxury yacht owner",91
NA,who hopes to represent the working class.,91
NA,As George Apap-a great Labor Party lu-,91
NA,"minary-said, Labor has lost touch with its",91
NA,supporters and keeps fielding these out-of-,91
NA,touch academics. He even accused the,91
NA,honourable member for Port Adelaide of,91
NA,handing out how to vote cards for the Lib-,91
NA,"erals. How ironic. Well, I have got some",91
NA,"news for the head kicker, and that is that he",91
NA,has lost the plot on my exposure of the,91
NA,Australian Democrats and their attempts to,91
NA,misrepresent their contribution to the Sen-,91
NA,ate. But then the honourable member for,91
NA,Port Adelaide went on to extol the virtues,91
NA,of what he and his Government were doing,91
NA,for the pensioners and the superannuants. If,91
NA,"we talk to the Government, it says those",91
NA,tens of thousands of elderly Australians have,91
NA,got nothing to complain about. But talk to,91
NA,the 38 pensioners who turned up at the,91
NA,Prospect Returned Services League meeting,91
NA,"for the Bannon, Crattey Duigan, Harvey",91
NA,talkfest. Ask them about raising the tax,91
NA,threshold or income splitting.,91
NA,The honourable member for Port Adelaide,91
NA,condemned me for being involved in Liberal,91
NA,pamphlets at the pensioners rally. What does,91
NA,he say to the Prospect mailing list cunningly,91
NA,described as an address book-'Please sign if,91
NA,you would like to be on the Premier's task,91
NA,force inquiry'? It is obvious that the on,91
NA,ground intelligence must have escaped the,91
NA,"eyes of one Michael Wright, because 180",91
NA,petitions distributed at the rally have come,91
NA,flooding into my electorate office. They in-,91
NA,"clude names from Albert Park, Semaphore",91
NA,"and Birkenhead, good suburbs that the",91
NA,honourable member would know about.,91
NA,"I do not mind a healthy debate, but if",91
NA,someone is going to chop me up to help his,91
NA,"bloke in Adelaide, then his people are going",91
NA,to have to be a bit smarter. The honourable,91
NA,member concluded with the fact that he has,91
NA,been in this Parliament for 11 months and,91
NA,not seen from our side 'a policy on helping,91
NA,pensioners in need'. The honourable member,91
NA,has in fact been here for 12 months and in,91
NA,that time has made one 90-second speech-,91
NA,some 300 words at less than 30 a month. On,91
NA,1 December he made 90 seconds worth. For,91
NA,"my part, I have made 26 speeches to the",91
NA,"House, including nine concerning specific",91
NA,pensioner problems. I have with me in black,91
NA,and white the coalition's retirement incomes,91
NA,"policy, which the honourable member for",91
NA,Port Adelaide has never seen. That is one,91
NA,policy which the Government does not have.,91
Mr LEE ,Dobell) (1O.40)-The honour-,91
NA,NA,91
NA,"has just finished speaking, said--",91
NA,Mr Sawford-He walks out again.,91
Mr LEE,I hope he remains in the cham-,91
NA,ber for my comments. He said he partici-,91
NA,pates as often as possible in the adjournment,91
NA,debates because he is on a steep learning,91
NA,curve. He is trying to learn about parlia-,91
NA,ment. I wish him well in seeking to learn as,91
NA,much as he can about the chamber. I hope,91
NA,that the next lesson he learns is that when,91
NA,one is going to drop a bucket on someone a,91
NA,gentleman at least tells the person who is,91
NA,the target for· his attack that he is going to,91
NA,make a speech about something to do with,91
NA,him. I understand that when the honourable,91
NA,member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Sawford),92
NA,said something critical about the honourable,92
NA,member for Adelaide he made sure that the,92
NA,honourable member for Adelaide was in the,92
NA,chamber at the time the comments were,92
NA,made. This is not the first time that the,92
NA,honourable member for Adelaide has acted,92
NA,in this way. At least this time he is not,92
NA,"picking on a female member of Parliament,",92
NA,as he has done in the past.,92
NA,"Mr MCGauran-Madam Speaker, I take",92
NA,a point of order. I would seek a withdrawal,92
NA,of that comment. It connotes bullying and is,92
NA,an attack on a member.,92
NA,Madam SPEAKER-Order! The honour-,92
NA,able member will resume his seat. There is,92
NA,no point of order.,92
Mr LEE,"I make it clear,. Madam",92
NA,"Speaker, that I was referring to the honour-",92
NA,"able member for Hawker ( Mrs Harvey),",92
NA,whom the honourable member for Adelaide,92
NA,previously attacked without any warning. I,92
NA,would simply say to him that if he wishes in,92
NA,future during the adjournment debate to at-,92
NA,tack members on this side of the House or,92
NA,perhaps members of the National Party of,92
NA,Australia or anyone else--,92
NA,Mr Smith-Never from Tasmania.,92
Mr LEE,Especially if they are from Tas-,92
NA,mania; the gentlemanly and parliamentary,92
NA,thing to do is at least to tell the person,92
NA,concerned that he is going to give a speech,92
NA,"which might be of interest. This is, of course,",92
NA,part of his learning curve and I hope that in,92
NA,future debates in this House he takes that,92
NA,on board.,92
NA,The reason I rose tonight was to make,92
NA,some comments about a question which I,92
NA,placed on notice concerning a Mr Konrad,92
NA,"Kalejs, a gentleman who could be deported",92
NA,from the United States of America. I received,92
NA,the following information from the Minister,92
NA,for the Arts and Territories ( Mr Holding),92
NA,"on behalf of the Minister for Immigration,",92
NA,Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Sen-,92
NA,ator Robert Ray):,92
NA,"(I) On I November 1988 a US immigration judge,",92
NA,as a result of civil proceedings in the United,92
NA,"States, ordered that Mr Kalejs be deported from",92
NA,the United States . . .,92
NA,This was done because he had provided false,92
NA,information when applying for a visa to visit,92
NA,the United States. The second reason was as,92
NA,follows:,92
NA,(b) by his wartime activities he had 'assisted' in,92
NA,"the persecution of individuals based on race, religion,",92
NA,national origin or political opinion' and was deport-,92
NA,able under Section 241 (a) (19) of the US Immigra-,92
NA,tion and Nationality Act 1952 as amended.,92
NA,I point out that Mr Kalejs has appealed,92
NA,against the deportation order and it could be,92
NA,a long time before the appeal process is,92
NA,finalised. I am concerned that in answer to,92
NA,my question on notice the Minister has made,92
NA,it very clear that if a US citizen had been in,92
NA,"Australia under similar circumstances, Aus-",92
NA,tralia could not have asked that person to,92
NA,leave our country. We do not have the same,92
NA,protection which the US legislation provides.,92
NA,We all know that Australian taxpayers are,92
NA,about to spend a great deal of money in,92
NA,seeking to ensure that people who it is al-,92
NA,leged have committed war crimes in Europe,92
NA,during the Second World War and who have,92
NA,a case to answer will be forced to appear in,92
NA,an Australian court of law and have that,92
NA,case heard in a fair trial. I am concerned,92
NA,that Mr Kalejs will be deported to Australia,92
NA,if his appeal is unsuccessful and Australian,92
NA,taxpayers will possibly then have to pay for,92
NA,a trial against that gentleman.,92
NA,The Minister has confirmed that it is pos-,92
NA,sible that Mr Kalejs gave false information,92
NA,when he applied to visit Australia way back,92
NA,on 27 October 1950 and he possibly also,92
NA,gave false information when he obtained,92
NA,Australian citizenship in 1957. I believe that,92
NA,that should be sufficient grounds for deport-,92
NA,ing Mr Kalejs to his country of birth.,92
Mr MCGAURAN ,Gippsland) (10.45)-,92
NA,"That insidious organisation, the League of",92
NA,"Rights, has attracted a great deal of com-",92
NA,ment both in and outside the Parliament in,92
NA,recent months. Much of this comment was,92
NA,commenced by the very courageous National,92
NA,"Party of Australia senator for Queensland,",92
NA,"Senator Ron Boswell, who sought to expose",92
NA,its operations and influences for what they,92
NA,really are-a grave threat to many of our,92
NA,institutions. A number of Australian Labor,92
NA,Party members hoped to jump on the band-,92
NA,wagon. Let me deal with two of those Labor,92
NA,"members who, in the process, damaged",92
NA,wrongly and utterly unfairly the reputation,92
NA,of an individual and worthy organisation.,92
NA,The honourable member for Robertson,93
NA,"( Mr Cohen), in an article he wrote in the",93
NA,"Bulletin on 29 November last year, headed",93
NA,"'League of Wrongs', described the organisaabsolutely",93
NA,tion Women Who Want to be Women as a,93
NA,'front organisation' of the League of Rights.,93
NA,"This is utterly false. WWWW, which is now",93
NA,"incorporated into the organisation Endeaso,",93
NA,"vour Forum, has never had any contact with",93
NA,"the League of Rights. Indeed, as I shall now",93
NA,"demonstrate, it has been at the forefront of sive remarks.",93
NA,fighting the League of Rights. The founding,93
NA,member and currently the national and overpricornia,93
NA,"seas coordinator of WWWW, now Endeanotoriety",93
NA,"vour Forum, is a person for whom I have",93
NA,great deal of respect. Mrs Babette Francis,93
NA,"Indian by birth and, if anybody in our",93
NA,community knows about supposed multiculthe,93
NA,"turalism or taunts of racism, I would suggest",93
NA,that she does. I understand that Mrs Francis,93
NA,once accepted an invitation to speak at the,93
NA,annual conference of the League of Rights,93
NA,because it is the policy of the Endeavour,93
NA,Forum to accept all speaking engagements,93
NA,regardless of the views of the host organisaForum,93
NA,tion. When she spoke to the League she took,93
NA,"the opportunity to condemn strongly its antilife,",93
NA,"Zionist philosphy, and she especially conganisations.",93
NA,demned their questioning of the numbers .of,93
NA,Jewish victims of the Holocaust-so much,93
NA,"so that Dr Bill Rubinstein, of the editorial",93
NA,"board of Australia/Israel Publications, wrote:",93
NA,Thanks for your remarks in our favour at,93
NA,League of Rights do. This turned up in their,93
NA,zine attached . . . Many thanks again for doing,93
NA,"this-it showed great courage, I'm sure as",93
NA,activities do . . .,93
NA,"Moreover, Women Who Want to be Women vour Forum.",93
NA,was the only Australian women's group in,93
NA,the non-government organisations forums,93
NA,both the United Nations Mid-decade for,93
NA,Women Conference in Copenhagen in 1980,93
NA,and the final Decade for Women Conference,93
NA,in Nairobi in 1985 which openly expressed,93
NA,support for the Israeli delegation and the,93
NA,right of Israel to exist as an independent,93
NA,nation with defensible frontiers. If the,93
NA,honourable member for Robertson needs any,93
NA,"proof of that, I refer him to a report of",93
NA,those conferences in Quadrant of December,93
NA,"1980 and December 1985. Interestingly,",93
NA,Babette Francis herself made the point that,93
NA,no other kind of support was offered by,93
NA,feminist groups funded by the Australian,93
NA,Government to attend those conferences.,93
NA,Earlier this year Endeavour Forum pub-,93
NA,"lished Gizela, the story of a Jewish Holo-",93
NA,caust victim written by her mother. So it is,93
NA,wrong for the honourable member,93
NA,for Robertson to make that attack on En-,93
NA,deavour Forum and specifically Mrs Babette,93
NA,Francis. Despite having been requested to do,93
NA,the honourable member has never apol-,93
NA,ogised to either Mrs Francis or Endeavour,93
NA,Forum for his utterly inaccurate and offen-,93
NA,"Similarly, the honourable member for Ca-",93
NA,"( Mr Wright), in a speech of some",93
NA,"in this place late last year, also",93
NA,"a attacked the four Ws, or Endeavour Forum,",93
NA,is as being an apologist group for the League,93
NA,of Rights. Mrs Babette Francis also wrote to,93
NA,honourable member for Capricornia,93
NA,"seeking an apology. Instead, I understand",93
NA,that the honourable member for Capricornia,93
NA,"wrote back to her, not offering any sort of",93
NA,apology but listing a whole set of questions,93
NA,relating to financial status and membership,93
NA,and organisational aspects of Endeavour,93
NA,for answering. Endeavour Forum is,93
NA,a group of sincere individuals who are pro-,93
NA,pro-family and anti-radical feminist or-,93
NA,It is made up of people of intel-,93
NA,"ligence, integrity and utter fairness. To my",93
NA,"knowledge, and certainly to the knowledge",93
NA,"of the office-holders of that organisation, none",93
NA,of these people would have any contact with,93
NA,the the League of Rights. I call on the honour-,93
NA,magaable member for Robertson and the honour-,93
NA,all your able member for Capricornia now to,93
NA,apologise to Mrs Francis and to the Endea-,93
Mr SAWFORD ,Port Adelaide) (10.50)-,93
NA,at The honourable member for Adelaide ( Mr,93
NA,Pratt) is not here to hear me respond to his,93
NA,comments. Last Thursday night in the ad-,93
NA,journment debate I praised him for his essen-,93
NA,tial idea of caring for the elderly citizens of,93
NA,"Australia, and I am sure that view is shared",93
NA,by every honourable member on the Govern-,93
NA,"ment side. However, he failed to accept my",93
NA,"suggestion that he should get to the stomach,",93
NA,"the means, the substance of what he is trying",93
NA,to do for pensioners. In his speech last,93
NA,Mrs Thursday he slammed the Australian Dem-,93
NA,ocrats for handing out pamphlets and ignor-,93
NA,the ing the wishes of the senior citizens of,93
NA,"Adelaide, but he failed to address the issue",93
NA,that the Liberal Party in South Australia,93
NA,handed out pamphlets. It is interesting that,94
NA,on that day the Labor Party complied with,94
NA,the wishes of the senior citizens and did not,94
NA,hand out pamphlets.,94
NA,The trouble with the ideas of the honour-,94
NA,able member for Adelaide is that they lack,94
NA,"substance. For example, last Thursday night",94
NA,the honourable member for Adelaide made,94
NA,some claims about the Bannon Labor Gov-,94
NA,ernment in South Australia. He referred to,94
NA,increased violence against the elderly. The,94
NA,honourable member is simply not telling the,94
NA,truth. I shall mention some of the achieve-,94
NA,ments of the Bannon Labor Government in,94
NA,South Australia. They include the enactment,94
NA,of the Summary Offences Act with increased,94
NA,penalties for over 50 offences. The maximum,94
NA,penalty for rape is life imprisonment. The,94
NA,maximum penalty for indecent assault is eight,94
NA,years. The maximum penalty for robbery,94
NA,with violence is life imprisonment. The,94
NA,honourable member did not mention the,94
NA,amendment to section 302 of the Criminal,94
NA,Law Consolidation Act which resulted in a,94
NA,substantial increase in the level of sentences,94
NA,for armed robbery and other crimes. He failed,94
NA,to mention the Crimes (Confiscation of Prof-,94
NA,"its) Act, introduced in 1986, allowing the",94
NA,courts to order the forfeiture of assets ob-,94
NA,tained as a result of criminal activity. He,94
NA,failed to mention the penalties for drug,94
NA,fickers in South Australia-a fine up to,94
NA,"$250,000 and 25 years in gaol. He failed to",94
NA,mention that the Attorney-General in South,94
NA,Australia has authorised over 100 appeals.,94
NA,The honourable member for Adelaide,94
NA,failed to acknowledge that in South Aus-,94
NA,tralia over 100 Neighbourhood Watch areas,94
NA,have been established. He failed to acknowl-,94
NA,edge that funding for the Police Department,94
NA,in South Australia has increased by $83m in,94
NA,"the past six years. By the way, South Aus-",94
NA,"tralia has the highest ratio of -0iil,;e per",94
NA,capita of any State. An examination of the,94
NA,evidence and a reading of the facts show,94
NA,that there has not been a downturn in the,94
NA,value of penalties for offences and that there,94
NA,is no evidence to support the claim of the,94
NA,honourable member for Adelaide that there,94
NA,has been a dramatic upswing in crime aimed,94
NA,at the elderly of South Australia.,94
NA,The real point in my criticism of the,94
NA,"honourable member for Adelaide is that, al-",94
NA,though it is acknowledged that he has the,94
NA,"idea right, it is no use in this House having",94
NA,a good idea and not having the wherewithal,94
NA,to put forward a policy and be able to state,94
NA,what the specifics of that policy are. That is,94
NA,really what I said. What is the outcome of,94
NA,the honourable member's making that state-,94
NA,ment? Is he feeling good? The outcome is,94
NA,"nil, nothing, zero, nix, zilch, nought. It is a",94
NA,completely blank nadir. It is an inverted,94
NA,zenith. As I said to the honourable member,94
NA,"of Adelaide on Thursday night, he came into",94
NA,bat for the elderly-that is a great thing,94
NA,which members of the Government side re-,94
NA,spect-but he made a duck. He did not,94
NA,make any runs. Tonight he again stated some,94
NA,"very valid and good ideas, but he had no",94
NA,"wherewithal, no substance, no process, no",94
NA,facility to implement the ideas. Again he,94
NA,made no runs.,94
NA,NA,94
Mr SAWFORD,He nicked his own,94
NA,"wicket, as the honourable member for Chi-",94
NA,fley said. I think he did more than that. I,94
NA,think he was bowled middle stump. I think,94
NA,the honourable member for Adelaide has a,94
NA,"genuine concern for people in his electorate,",94
NA,but I would like to see him come up in this,94
NA,House with a little more than a piece of,94
NA,paper which he says is his Party's policy for,94
NA,traf- the elderly in South Australia.,94
Mr SMITH ,Bass) (10.55)-Today,94
NA,marked the opening of the Australian Insti-,94
NA,tute of Radiography's fortieth annual confer-,94
NA,"ence. I was present at that conference, and",94
NA,radiography has some problems which I,94
NA,should like to bring to the attention of the,94
NA,House. Some researchers indicate that ra-,94
NA,diography as a profession is under some strain,94
NA,in this country. It is a service that most of,94
NA,us experience when we go to have X-rays,94
NA,taken.,94
NA,Back in October 1986 the Institute in New,94
NA,South Wales called for a limited operator,94
NA,training program to allow medical staff in,94
NA,outback and remote New South Wales hos-,94
NA,pitals to attain basic knowledge of X-ray,94
NA,equipment. Why was this so? It was revealed,94
NA,that patients in remote New South Wales,94
NA,hospitals were being exposed to radiation,94
NA,"doses up to 1,000 times higher than neces-",94
NA,sary because staff were operating the X-ray,94
NA,equipment in an untrained way. One exam-,94
NA,ple quoted to me involved a nurse who had,94
NA,made 34 attempts at X-raying a patient in a,95
NA,small country town before the patient was,95
NA,sent to Dubbo Hospital. Another example,95
NA,involved a 16-year-old girl who had two,95
NA,punctured lungs which were missed by inves-,95
NA,tigating doctors after a young nurse was asked,95
NA,"to operate the X-ray equipment. In my view,",95
NA,the national conference has the ideal oppor-,95
NA,tunity to raise these issues to national prom-,95
NA,inence at its conference in Launceston this,95
NA,week.,95
NA,For most Australians the profession is the,95
NA,front line in preventive medical procedure,95
NA,"for breast cancer. More than 5,000 cases of",95
NA,breast cancer are diagnosed each year in,95
NA,Australia and one in 15 develops the disease,95
NA,during her lifetime. For this reason alone the,95
NA,profession of radiography must make its voice,95
NA,"heard so that every Australian, whether a",95
NA,"city or country dweller, is able to obtain",95
NA,those expert services.,95
NA,"Interestingly, back in 1986 the New South",95
NA,Wales Government's response to the pro-,95
NA,"posal for this urgent training program, was",95
NA,"that it was far too expensive. However, one",95
NA,"may legitimately ask the question, 'Can pre-",95
NA,ventive or early warning and correct diag-,95
NA,nostic procedures ever be too expensive?'.,95
NA,All honourable members in this chamber,95
NA,know that the cost of health services is ex-,95
NA,cessive and preventive medicine is by far and,95
NA,away the best and cheapest medicine to the,95
NA,overall community.,95
NA,Earlier this month the United States,95
NA,National Cancer Institute's most recent fig-,95
NA,"ures for 1985, released this month, show that",95
NA,the incidence of new breast cancer cases,95
NA,diagnosed per year is the highest in history,95
NA,in the United States. The death rate from,95
NA,breast cancer has increased and this increase,95
NA,may be attributed to diagnosing more cases,95
NA,with new technology or it may be a real,95
NA,"increase in the spread of cancer. However,",95
NA,the specialists admit they do not know. Only,95
NA,10 to 20 percent of United States women,95
NA,have regular screenings. In Australia the fig-,95
NA,ure is estimated at below 5 per cent. Britain,95
NA,also has concerns about radiography and the,95
NA,extent of breast cancer and detection. The,95
NA,recommendations of the United Kingdom,95
NA,working group on breast cancer screening in,95
NA,1987 interestingly made the following,95
NA,observation:,95
NA,There is a need for a massive program to train,95
NA,radiographers to carry out procedures correctly.,95
NA,"Indeed, the same issue applies in Australia,",95
NA,but more so. It is estimated that in Britain,95
NA,the cost of a national screening program,95
NA,"every two years of women over 50, those",95
NA,"most susceptible to breast cancer, would save",95
NA,the life of one woman in 100 who otherwise,95
NA,would have died from breast cancer. In my,95
NA,"view, Australia must reassess its attitude to",95
NA,screening for breast cancer. I do not have all,95
NA,"the facts, but I worry whether government,",95
NA,"at both State and Federal level, appreciates",95
NA,the extent of the disease. I welcome the,95
NA,announcement of the Minister for Commu-,95
NA,nity Services and Health (Dr Blewett) of the,95
NA,Australian Radiation Laboratory survey to,95
NA,establish the range of radiation doses cur-,95
NA,rently being used in the latest technology.,95
NA,"However, is it enough just to make a rec-",95
NA,"ommendation, as Dr Blewett did in a press",95
NA,"release, that women over 40 should have an",95
NA,"initial mammograph, then regularly after that",95
NA,as advised by a doctor?,95
NA,My concern is that when one examines,95
NA,"the recent United Sta - figures, as well as",95
NA,the concern expressed in the United King-,95
NA,dom and at the conference in Launceston,95
NA,"today, one sees that Australia needs to dis-",95
NA,cuss these issues in far more depth than is,95
NA,the case at present. The participants in the,95
NA,Launceston conference will have the oppor-,95
NA,tunity during the national conference to raise,95
NA,"to national prominence these issues, which",95
NA,for too long have been ignored. The health,95
NA,of Australian women is being ignored. It is,95
NA,time that we all took a far closer look at,95
NA,this issue and supported the radiography,95
NA,profession.,95

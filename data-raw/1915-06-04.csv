NA,OMISSIONFROMNOTICE - PAPE R.,4
NA,- I wish to ask you,4
NA,"a question, Mr Speaker, regarding an",4
NA,omission f r om the notice-paper. Yester-,4
NA,day I moved an amendment on the mo-,4
NA,tion that MT . Speaker do now leave the,4
NA,"chair, and the House resolve itself into",4
NA,Committee of Supply. The amendment,4
NA,dealt w i th the providing of the neces-,4
NA,saries of life for the masses of the people',4
NA,"at reasonable prices. . A f t e r debate,",4
NA,its discussion was adjourned. I submit,5
NA,that my amendment should appear on the,5
NA,notice-paper for the next day of sitting,5
NA,"upon which i t can be considered, but i t",5
NA,does not appear at all. Not having been,5
NA,"disposed of, ib ought not, I think, to have",5
NA,been removed from the business-paper.,5
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,5
NA,ber is not i n order i n commenting on the,5
NA,subject-matter of his question.,5
NA,omission of the amendment from the,5
NA,notice-paper is i n accordance w i th the,5
NA,"practice of this House, and of the House",5
NA,of Commons. The procedure adopted on,5
NA,this occasion has always been followed.,5
NA,Standing order N o. 241 provides that,5
NA,after the Committee of Supply or Ways,5
NA,"and Means has reported progress, the",5
NA,Speaker shall leave the chair without,5
NA,putting any question when the Order of,5
NA,"the Day is read, except that on every",5
NA,third Thursday the first Order of the Day,5
NA,shall be either Supply or Ways and,5
NA,"Means, and the question shall be proposed",5
NA,that the Speaker do now leave the chair.,5
NA,"This not being the third Thursday, when",5
NA,"the Order of the Day is read, the Speaker",5
NA,must leave the chair without any question,5
NA,"being proposed, therefore the amend-",5
NA,ment has to be removed from the Orders,5
NA,of the Day. This is the procedure of,5
NA,the House of Commons as is shown in the,5
NA,"following passage i n May, page 610-",5
NA,If an adjourned debate on the question is,5
NA,"standing upon the notice-paper when supply,",5
NA,for the consideration of which in Committee,5
NA,it is not necessary to propose the question for,5
NA,"the Speaker's leaving the chair, is to be taken,",5
NA,the order of the day for resuming the adjourned,5

NA,"ment lapses, in order that the Speaker, in",5
NA,"obedience to the standing order, may leave the",5
NA,chair without question put.,5
Mr JH CATTS ,D o I understand,5
NA,that my proposition will not come before,5
NA,the House again?,5
Mr SPEAKER ,Tha t is so; i t has,5
NA,lapsed.,5
Mr JH CATTS ,B y leave of the.,5
NA,"House, I wish to make an explanation",5
NA,regarding the amendment. The Minis-,5
NA,"ter of Trade and Customs, when speaking",5
NA,"to i t , said that he would submit i t to the",5
NA,Cabinet i f I would promise to withdraw,5
NA,"i t , and I thereupon prepared a short",5
NA,statement in writing which I proposed to,5
NA,put before the House when asking leave,5
NA,to withdraw ib. I had no desire to pre-,5
NA,vent any honorable member from express-,5
NA,ing his opinion upon i t . That state-,5
NA,"ment, which I hold i n my hand,",5
NA,is to the effect that the Minister is,5
NA,prepared to submit the matter to the,5
NA,favorable consideration of the Govern-,5
NA,"ment, and that the decision of Ministers",5
NA,upon i t would be announced to the House.,5
NA,I considered that the purpose of my,5
NA,amendment would be largely achieved by,5
NA,that promise. I do not doubt the Minis-,5
NA,ter; but I did not want any misunder-,5
NA,The standing of what was in his and my own,5
NA,mind. As I have not been able to put,5
NA,before the House the statement to which,5
NA,"I refer, and my proposal having been",5
NA,"disposed of in a way not anticipated, I",5
NA,ask the Minister i f he will take the course,5
NA,mentioned?,5
Mr TUDOR , I promised the honor-,5
NA,"able member, i n the course of my remarks",5
NA,"yesberday, to inform the Government of",5
NA,the amendment.,5
Mr JH CATTS ,Th e Minister said,5
NA,more than that.,5
Mr TUDOR , I shall do what I,5
NA,promised. I shall put the amendment,5
NA,before the Cabinet. I feel sure that,5
NA,"every Minister, and every honorable mem-",5
NA,"ber of bhe House, is anxious to do all",5
NA,that can be done to reduce the cost of,5
NA,living.,5
NA,PEMALETELEPHONE OPERATORS.,5
Mr FENTON , I ask the Postmaster-,5
NA,General i f young women telephone opera-,5
NA,tors are employed at the Sydney Post,5
NA,"Office all night, and i f i t is intended to",5
NA,adopt the same practice i n Melbourne?,5
Mr SPENCE , I do not think that,5
NA,young women are employed all night at,5
NA,"the Sydney General Post Office, but I",5
NA,shall inquire. Women are employed all,5
NA,night at the Adelaide General Post Office,5
NA,ab their own request.,5
NA,CENSORSHIP OP NEWS .,5
Mr JENSEN ,Th e honorable member,5
NA,for Henty recently asked a question re-,5
NA,"garding the censorship of news, and sug-",5
NA,gested that news which was published i n,5
NA,England was prevented by the censors,5
NA,from appearing i n the Australian press.,5
NA,"I promised to make an inquiry, and I",5
NA,have now been furnished with the fol-,5
NA,lowing information on the subject:-,5
NA,The inference from Mr Boyd's question is,5
NA,that information regarding hospitals is sup-,5
NA,pressed by the censors. This is not correct. I t,5
NA,should be remembered that it is not the func-,5
NA,tion of the censor's office to give out informa-,5
NA,tion.,5
NA,"Regarding the Australia, all Australian war-",6
NA,ships are now under the control of the British,6
NA,"Admiralty, and any information is not with-",6
NA,held in Australia that the Admiralty may give,6
NA,to the public in England. Practically all in-,6
NA,formation tliat passes the London Press Bureau,6
NA,is given to tho public in Australia. Only in,6
NA,very exceptional cases is this rule departed,6
NA,from.,6
NA,HIGH COMMISSIONER'S TERM.,6
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Ca n the Minister of,6
NA,External Affairs inform the House what,6
NA,is the intention of the Government reago.,6
NA,garding the term of office of the High,6
NA,Commissioner? Is i t proposed to make,6
NA,an announcement at an early date?,6
Mr MAHON ,Th e fact was mentioned,6
NA,some time ago that the Government,6
NA,extended for twelve months the term,6
NA,the High Commissioner's appointment.,6
NA,think it was also announced that the,6
NA,vernment did not propose to add to that,6
NA,extension.,6
NA,CRUISER BRISBANE.,6
Mr FINLAYSON ,Ca n the Assistant,6
NA,Minister of Defence say when the cruiser,6
NA,"Brisbane, which is now being built at",6
NA,"Fitzroy Dock, will be ready for",6
NA,launching ?,6
Mr JENSEN , I think somewhere,6
NA,about the end of August.,6
NA,PANAMA EXPOSITION,6
NA,COMMISSIONERS.,6
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Ha s the Minister of Minister,6
NA,External Affairs perused the letter of,6
NA,correspondent of the Argus which is pub-,6
NA,lished in this morning's issue of that you are talking about.,6
NA,"journal, and sets out the communications",6
NA,that have passed between the honorable,6
NA,gentleman and the Panama Exposition,6
NA,Commissioners regarding the appointment,6
NA,of Mr Oughten. I ask the Minister if,6
NA,"what is published' is a fair resume"" of what",6
NA,took place?,6
Mr MAHON , I have hurriedly,6
NA,looked through the newspaper article,6
NA,"ferred to. I t contains numerous errors,-",6
NA,and is otherwise incomplete and. misleadthat,6
NA,ing. Its unauthorized publication has,6
NA,satisfied me that the affairs of the,6
NA,"mission require closer scrutiny, and that",6
NA,my action was necessary and proper.,6
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Ha s the correat,6
NA,spondence been laid on the table?,6
Mr MAHON ,No . Some of what,6
NA,"has been published is unofficial, being",6
NA,partially personal communications from,6
NA,one officer to another. The illicit dis-,6
NA,closure of confidential documents which,6
NA,has occurred in connexion with this,6
NA,Commission has had no parallel within,6
NA,my knowledge outside the mushroom re-,6
NA,publics of South America. This remark,6
NA,"applies not only to what is now published,,",6
NA,but to the premature publication of in-,6
NA,complete official documents a week or two<,6
NA,KILTED REGIMENTS.,6
Mr LIVINGSTON ,Ha s the Assist-,6
NA,ant Minister of Defence read a letter,6
NA,had which appeared in the Argus of 19th,6
NA,"of May, and was copied from the London",6
NA,"I Times, in which a soldier, writing from",6
NA,"Gothe seat of war, states that kilted men:",6
NA,have a great advantage over all others 7,6
NA,"The letter is too long to read now, but I",6
NA,"ask the Minister to read i t for himself,",6
NA,"and to consider its statements, so that at",6
NA,least one kilted regiment may be sent-,6
NA,from Australia to the seat of war.,6
Mr JENSEN , I have not seen the,6
NA,"letter, but I shall bring the honorable",6
NA,member's question under the notice of the,6
NA,Minister of Defence.,6
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -I n view of,6
NA,the fact that i t only costs about one-half,6
NA,the amount to supply a soldier with a,6
NA,"Scottish kilt, as compared with the price",6
NA,"of an ordinary uniform, will the Naval",6
NA,consider the advisability of send-,6
NA,the ing all the troops to the front in kilts?,6
Mr FOWLER ,Yo u do not know what,6
NA,There is three,6
NA,times as much cloth in a kilt as would,6
NA,make a suit of clothes for any man.,6
NA,BROADMEADOWS CAMP.,6
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I would like to,6
NA,ask the Assistant Minister of Defence a,6
NA,question relating to the Broadmeadows,6
NA,"reCamp, in order t» clear matters up.",6
NA,There are persistent statements outside,6
NA,all the deaths occurring at the camp,6
NA,are net being reported. Is i t a fact that,6
NA,Comthe deaths of some soldiers have taken,6
NA,place at their homes after their removal,6
NA,"from the camp, and that similarly some",6
NA,cases of serious illness are being attended,6
NA,the homes of the soldiers concerned.,6
NA,Were these cases declared in the return,6
NA,the Assistant Minister gave to the House,7
NA,the other day?,7
Mr JENSEN ," I think so, because T",7
NA,specially stated that only eleven deaths,7
NA,-out of tlie forty reported had occurred at,7
NA,Broadmeadows.,7
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Yo u said they had,7
NA,occurred at hospitals. Does that include,7
NA,homes ?,7
Mr JENSEN , I think so.,7
Mr JOSEPH COOK , W i l l you inquire?,7
Mr JENSEN ,"Yes , I will.",7
NA,want to hide anything.,7

NA,visability of adjourning this House for,7
NA,three weeks so as to allow each member,7
NA,"to go into his own electorate, and induce",7
NA,as many suitable electors to enroll as,7
NA,possible. W i l l he also endeavour to get,7
NA,the co-operation of the States i n the same,7
NA,movement ?,7
Mr TUDOR ,"A s f a r as I know, none",7
NA,of the State Parliaments are meeting at,7
NA,the present time except .that of Victoria.,7
NA,Members of this House had the oppor-,7
NA,tunity of doing what the honorable mem-,7
NA,ber suggests during the period from,7
NA,"December last to A p r i l , and I certainly",7
NA,shall not recommend the Prime Minister,7
NA,to adjourn the House for three weeks,7
NA,now. .Members have _b.ad-.the opportunity,7

NA,"asked the Minister of Home Affairs,",7
NA,upon notice-,7
NA,With reference to a statement made by him,7
NA,to a deputation of Federal members for Tas-,7
NA,"mania, to the effect that "" owing to the heavy",7
NA,"earthworks which were now in front of them,",7

NA,state-,7
NA,1. Between what mileages from Kalgoorlie,7

NA,in regard to this speed is likely to,7
NA,result?,7
Mr ARCHIBALD , T h e answer to the,7
NA,honorable member's questions is-,7
NA,". 1, 2, and 3. The deputation waited upon the",7
NA,Minister in regard to the use of Tasmanian,7
NA,"sleepers on the East-West line,, which really",7
NA,"RAILWAY. means on the eastern section of it , as Tas-",7
NA,"manian sleepers cannot, owing to freights, com-",7
NA,pete as to price with Western Australian tim-,7
NA,bers for the supply of sleepers delivered at,7
NA,"Kalgoorlie. There is not any proposal, to stop",7
NA,"the platelaying in the western section,, but, in a",7
NA,"little time, the earthwork gangs on the eastern",7
NA,"side will run into heavy cuttings, and plate-",7
NA,laying on that section will have to slacken,7
NA,down for a time.,7

Mr ANSTEY ,Bourke) [10.56] - A,9
NA,"week or so ago, when I was discussing",9
NA,the question of the formation of the,9
NA,"Rabaul court martial, I questioned the",9
NA,propriety of Colonel Lee occupying the,9
NA,position of President. I did so on the,9
NA,"ground, as I said, that any person oc-",9
NA,cupying the position of judge should have,9
NA,his own record clean. There the matter,9
NA,"rested until yesterday, when the Assistant",9
NA,Minister of Defence read out a statement,9
NA,in connexion with what was said to have,9
NA,been a court martial. I want to say dis-,9
NA,"tinctly that, i f I said anything that im-",9
NA,"properly reflects upon any man, whether",9
NA,"he is i n the A r m y or out of i t , I am",9
NA,quite prepared to make the fullest,9
NA,I,9
NA,"contend, however, that the report",9
NA,honorable,9
NA,referred to by the Minister has,9
NA,"justified me in the attitude I took up,",9
NA,that i f Colonel Lee had suffered any dis-,9
NA,grace he should not have been permitted,9
NA,to occupy the position he did. I pointed,9
NA,"out then, i n connexion with Colonel Lee,",9
NA,that the South African business had been,9
NA,going on for a period of years - The docu-,9
NA,"ments in connexion with i t , presented",9
NA,"to the Parliament of New South Wales,",9
NA,"occupy over 100 pages, and they embrace",9
NA,correspondence over a period of several,9
NA,"years. I n the first place, they dealt",9
NA,tenderly with Colonel Lee. They asked,9
NA,"him to try and settle his case, but he ab-",9
NA,solutely refused. I t was then reported,9
NA,"to Major-General Hutton, and a Board'",9
NA,of Inquiry was held. I t was presided over,9
NA,"by Colonel Waddell, and another membei-",9
NA,was Colonel Knox. As I pointed out,9
NA,"previously, the proceedings appeared to be",9
NA,so absolutely objectionable that the Go-,9
NA,vernment of New South Wales protested,9
NA,and submitted a complaint to the Federal,9
NA,"Minister of Defence, Sir John Forrest;",9
NA,and the papers bear his minute to the,9
NA,"effect that, as the Privy Council and the",9
NA,Supreme Court always made known their,9
NA,"reasons for any decision, this Board",9
NA,"should have done so, and that, as the",9
NA,"notes of a Judge were public property,",9
NA,the notes of the Board should also be,9
NA,"public property, and be made available",9
NA,to the Government of New SouthWales.,10
NA,"Following on that, Colonel Waddell",10
NA,pointed out that unquestionably the notea,10
NA,were the property of the Defence Departsafe to inquire,10
NA,"ment, and should not be given up to ported.",10
NA,"tlie Government of New South Wales, and",10
NA,"that he, being manager of a bank i n New",10
NA,"Soutli Wales, and Lieut -Colonel Knox,",10
NA,"being a manager for Dalgety's, the de-",10
NA,mand upon tliem to give up their' notes,10
NA,was a. reflection on their honour and i n -,10
NA,tegrity-i n spite of thefact that Colonel,10
NA,Lee had offered a payment by way of,10
NA,compromise of £ 1 6 8 on the £300 repre-,10
NA,senting the first item. The next stage,10
NA,was reached when the A u d i t Department,10
NA,Inspector said-,10
NA,There is a very grave element of suspicion,10
NA,in. his failure to account for the £700 advanced,10
NA,"by, this State, and the matter should not be to the extent of £ 3 4 5.",10
NA,allowed to drop until the most searching in-,10
NA,vestigation has been held.,10
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wh o saidi that?,10
Mr ANSTEY ," Mr Brodie, the Chief made for the first time.",10
NA,Inspector of Public Accounts i n New_,10
NA,South Wales. He said-,10
NA,I am prepared to substantiate the foregoing offered,10
NA,charges. .,10
NA,"I n effect, he said, "" I formulate these on",10
NA,"charges, and i f I am given a court martial",10
NA,"I . guarantee to prove them, because I",10
NA,"call evidence, and put forward my own",10
NA,"statement."" Major-General Hutton absotribunal",10
NA,lutely refused to grant a court martial.,10
NA,The other day the Assistant Minister of,10
NA,Defence was probably under a misappresee,10
NA,hension in this respect.,10
Mr JENSEN , I should have said,10
NA,""" i n q u i r y "" instead of "" c o u r t m a r t i a l . """,10
Mr ANSTEY ,"Yes , that is an",10
NA,mitted fact. Mr Brodie said-,10
NA,I should be allowed to give,10
NA,"in support of the charges, and have free access",10
NA,to ail papers bearing thereon; I should be have,10
NA,allowed to call and examine snch witnesses ment the,10
NA,"as I may require to support the charges; I of theI case,",10
NA,"should be allowed to cross-examine Lieut - or any of histowitnesses,",10
NA,"Colonel Lee, or any witnesses he may bring with a copy of the daily notes",10
NA,to support his case. I should be allowed a guidance. Tbe case is too serious,10
NA,copy of the daily notes of evidence. If allowed,10
NA,"these facilities of conducting the case, I",10
NA,prepared to prove that Lieut -Colonel Lee recalled and examined behind my back as at be,10
NA,ceived refunds of pay made to the English,10
NA,detachment of Lancers in South Africa amountprevious,10
NA,"ing to several hundreds of pounds, the major aconsideration",10
NA,portion of which he has absolutely failed to investigate,10
NA,"account for, and which he denied having rein the hands",10
NA,"ceived; and, further, that Lieut -Colonel Lee view to such proceedings",10
NA,drew cheques for £20 and £40 respectively on meet the case.,10
NA,"the 24th February, 1900, for which he has",10
NA,failed to produce any voucher or record,10
NA,ing his disposal thereof.,10
NA,"Again, he went-on to say-",10
NA,Additional information as regards the irregu-,10
NA,"larities, in that officer's accounts has been",10
NA,"brought, to' light sincethe Board of Officers",10
NA,intothe facts previously re-,10
NA,"The request was refused, but the' Defence",10
NA,Department said that there would be,10
NA,another Board. They said that the old,10
NA,"Board would be reconstituted, and that",10
NA,Colonel Waddell and Lieut -Colonel Knox,10
NA,"would again sit, and go over the addi-",10
NA,"tional evidence, because, i n addition to the",10
NA,"£300 which Colonel Lee had, and which",10
NA,he had. offered to square by the payment of,10
NA,"' £ 1 6 8 , there came to light the further fact",10
NA,"-that , although in the first place he had",10
NA,sworn that out of the £400' he had re-,10
NA,"ceipts from, his predecessor, i t transpired",10
NA,afterwards that he had secured refunds,10
NA,"Therefore, i n",10
NA,addition to the original charge relating,10
NA,"to the £300, there was a further charge",10
NA,"of appropriating £400, which was now",10
NA,B u t a court,10
NA,martial was refused. Then Mr Brodie,10
NA,"reported i n July, 1903-",10
NA,As no satisfactory explanation has been,10
NA,by Colonel Lee respecting his disburse-,10
NA,"ment of the advance of £700, unless an inquiry",10
NA,"oath is instituted, or a court martial, there",10
NA,will be no alternative but for the proper offi-,10
NA,cer of this State to lay a criminal charge,10
NA,can against Colonel Lee for embezzlement.,10
NA,"The Board of Inquiry, which was the only",10
NA,that the Defence Department,10
NA,"would allow, then sat, and any one who",10
NA,reads the report of its proceedings will,10
NA,that there was no summary of evi-,10
NA,"dence, nor any statement that Colonel",10
NA,"Lee was not guilty, and that the Board",10
NA,simply set themselves tomake explana-,10
NA,tions as to why the money had not been,10
NA,adaccounted for. So utterly unsatisfactory,10
NA,were the whole proceedings that Inspector,10
NA,personal evidence Brodie wrote-,10
NA,It is desired to be known whether I shall,10
NA,right to state a case for the Depart-,10
NA,"represent, to call witnesses in support",10
NA,cross-examine the respondent,10
NA,and to be furnished,10
NA,of evidence for,10
NA,to be dealt,10
NA,"with in any other way, as a considerable",10
NA,am of money is involved. If witnesses are tosum,10
NA,a,10
NA,"inquiry, then I strongly urge for the",10
NA,of the Honorable Premier that,10
NA,Royal Commission be appointed to thoroughly,10
NA,"the matter, or that it be placed",10
NA,"of the Crown Solicitor, with a",10
NA,being taken as may,10
NA,showThen he went on to enumerate these,10
NA,points from time to time. The second,10
NA,"Bowd, which was the original Board renexion",11
NA,constituted came to the same old decision,11
NA,"in December, and Mr Brodie reported",11
NA,to the chief of his Department-,11
NA,"It will be difficult, I think, for any",11
NA,"mind to understand, from a perusal",11
NA,evidence given by Lieut -Colonel Cox-whic,11

NA,with the statement bhat there was no,11
NA,doubt Mr Brodie had been prompted,11
NA,by consideration f o r the highest pub-,11

NA,the members of these tribunals,11

NA,"protect their fellow officers, that",11
NA,could not be said to be proper Boards to,11
NA,make investigations. Mr Brodie wrote-,11
NA,"The evidence, to my mind, is so conclusive",11
NA,against Lieut -Colonel Lee that I recommend,11
NA,the papers be now referred to the Crown,11
NA,"citor, with the view of determining whether",11

Mr FOWLER ,Doe s the honorable,12

Mr ANSTEY ,Yes .,12

NA,statement.,12
Mr GROOM ,Hav e you any official in-,12
NA,formation to that effect?,12
Mr ANSTEY ,No . Some people,12
NA,may say that i t is absolutely improper to,12
NA,bring up such a case. Here is a con-,12
NA,trary case of a man who enlisted to serve,12
NA,"his country, and was discharged from the",12
NA,"service at Broadmeadows, because four-",12
NA,teen years ago he had committed an error,12
NA,in connexion with a Waterbury watch.,12
NA,They raked up the record of a man four-,12
NA,"teen years ago, and refused to permit",12
NA,him to fight for his country. Some people,12
NA,.express indignation at my having raked,12
NA,". up Colonel Lee's record, but there is a",12
NA,distinction between Colonel Lee and this,12
NA,private. The latter was not appointed,12
NA,to be the judge of another; he was merely,12
NA,prepared to shed his blood for his coun-,12
NA,"try, but he was not permitted to do so,",12
NA,though after the incident of the Water-,12
NA,bury watch he had led a blameless and,12
NA,;,12
NA,"unimpeachable life. Furthermore, he",12
NA,"had ten days' pay due to him, yet the",12
NA,military officers refused to pay i t .,12
Mr JENSEN ,Wha t is the name of that,12
NA,-soldier ?,12
Mr ANSTEY , I hand the name to,12
NA,"the Assistant Minister, and i f he can",12
NA,secure justice in that case I wish he would,12
NA,do so.,12
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,D o you think that,12
NA,the Department should not have raked,12
NA,up that case?,12
Mr ANSTEY , I do not. I t was not,12
NA,"for the sake of raking up a scandal,",12
NA,flecting on any errors in Colonel Lee's,12
NA,past that I introduced his name in this,12
NA,discussion; but I consider that he should,12
NA,have had sufficient discretion not to,12
NA,occupy the position of judge in a court,12
NA,martial; that is the only reason why I,12
NA,introduced his name in this connexion. A,12
NA,statement appeared in the press on Satur-,12
NA,"day last that the Minister, "" in justice to",12
NA,"Colonel Lee,"" was going to have the",12
NA,"papers read. Why "" in justice to Colonel",12
NA,"Lee?"" I f there was to be justice done,",12
NA,it was not to be for any particular in-,12
NA,"dividual, but for the country, and if i t",12
NA,was to be done in justice to any par-,12
NA,"ticular individual, why should not the",12
NA,Assistant Minister have read the whole of,12
NA,the report?,12
Mr JENSEN ,From the document that,12
NA,you have handed to me in regard to the,12
NA,"private to whom you refer, I find he was",12
NA,the discharged for having made a wilfully false,12
NA,statement in answer to a question-quit e,12
NA,a different matter.,12
Mr ANSTEY , I am sure that the,12
NA,"Minister, like myself, desires to elicit the",12
NA,"truth. I n this case, the man had served",12
NA,three months' imprisonment fourteen,12
NA,years previously. Was i t not natural,12
NA,that he should make no mention of that,12
NA,fact? Was there any need for him to,12
NA,record i t on his papers ? But some one,12
NA,"kuew what had happened to him, and re-",12
NA,"ported him, with the result that he was",12
NA,dismissed from the service because he had,12
NA,not disclosed that fact.,12
Mr JENSEN ,Bu t the honorable mem-,12
NA,ber did not put i t in that way. This,12
NA,man was dismissed for making a wilfully,12
NA,false statement in answer to a question.,12
Mr ANSTEY , I leave the case to the,12
NA,"Minister, believing that he will do jus-",12
NA,tice. Is not the honor and reputation,12
NA,of a private in the ranks just as im-,12
NA,portant as is that of a colonel? A week,12
NA,or two ago I brought before the House,12
NA,the case of Private Campbell. Is i t not,12
NA,time that justice was done to him ? Pri-,12
NA,vate Campbell was alleged to have made,12
NA,a confession. He swore that he did not,12
NA,"do so. I f he did not, and i f the alleged",12
NA,written confession made by him is not,12
NA,"producible, i t stands out that officers have",12
NA,conspired and perjured themselves. We,12
NA,should have had the papers relating to,12
NA,Private Campbell's case produced with,12
NA,just as much readiness as have been the,12
NA,papers relating to Colonel Lee. There,12
NA,or reshould have been a report from Colonel,12
NA,"Holmes, stating what he has done with",12
NA,"the alleged confession, or the confession",12
NA,itself should be produced. We should be,12
NA,able to give the common soldiery of the,12
NA,Commonwealth a guarantee that justice,12
NA,will be done to them. Then there is the,12
NA,"complaint made by Dr Antill Pockley, a",12
NA,"man of repute, that Major Maguire has",13
NA,failed to account for the effects of his,13
NA,who was killed at Babaul. The doctor,13
NA,says that they got away with his Son's,13
NA,"property, but nothing has been done by",13
NA,the Department in regard to that allega-,13
NA,tion. I f we wish to encourage recruiting,13
NA,we must give a guarantee to the common,13
NA,"soldiery that they will secure justice, and",13
NA,that justice knows no discrimination be-,13
NA,tween officers and the men in the ranks.,13
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Tha t is a,13
NA,perfectly sound position.,13
Mr ANSTEY ,I t is; and i t is the,13
NA,position which I take up. Questions in,13
NA,"regard to these cases have been put, and",13
NA,have not been answered; nothing has been,13
NA,done. Colonel Lee stands condemned as,13
NA,a man.who ought not to have occupied a,13
NA,position on the court martial. Without,13
NA,wishing to load up a man with any of the,13
NA,"shortcomings of his past, I assert that",13
NA,the records of the country justify my,13
NA,original position that Colonel Lee should,13
NA,not have occupied a position on this court,13
NA,martial.,13
Mr CHARLTON ,Hunter) [11.18] -,13
NA,This question has been brought before the,13
NA,House on several occasions. I think that,13
NA,the honorable member for Bourke was jus-,13
NA,tified in taking up the stand that he did,13
NA,in demanding that certain matters relat-,13
NA,ing to the court martial and all that hap-,13
NA,pened at Rabaul should be cleared up;,13
NA,and I would remind the House that the,13
NA,Prime Minister has already pledged him-,13
NA,self to see that they are. I am with the,13
NA,"honorable member, and would have sup-",13
NA,ported him all along the line in making,13
NA,"that demand, and I have more than once",13
NA,expressed the view that honorable mem-,13
NA,bers have the rightto come to the House,13
NA,with any grievance which they consider,13
NA,"should be ventilated; but, whilst we have",13
NA,"this privilege, we ought to be very care-",13
NA,ful not to attack the reputation of any,13
NA,man unless we have facts to support our,13
NA,"charges. Now, what is the position in",13
NA,"regard to Colonel Lee, whom the honor-",13
NA,"able member for Bourke has attacked,",13
NA,"and who, I may say, is a stranger to me 1",13
NA,Hearing the statements quoted last week,13
NA,by the honorable member for Bourke,13
NA,"from the report of the Board, which, un-",13
NA,"fortunately, is not available at the",13
NA,"moment, I concluded that this officer",13
NA,should not have been permitted to take,13
NA,part in the court martial. The honor-,13
NA,able member certainly made i t appear,13
NA,that there were chargeable against him,13
NA,offences which made i t undesirable that,13
NA,son he should hold a commission in the Aus-,13
NA,"tralian Army. I , like others, thought",13
NA,that there was some substance in,13
NA,what the honorable member put before,13
NA,"us, but we found subsequently that he",13
NA,had carefully kept from the House the,13
NA,findings of _the Board of Inquiry which,13
NA,dealt with the charges made against,13
NA,Colonel Lee in New South Wales. When c,13
NA,I quote papers relating to an inquiry,13
NA,"into a charge made against any man, I",13
NA,take care to do him. justice. I certainly,13
NA,let the House know all the facts. I n this,13
NA,"case, if I had been attacking Colonel Lee,",13
NA,I should have put before the House all the,13
NA,facts relating to the findings of the Board,13
NA,of Inquiry which dealt with the ten,13
NA,charges that were brought against him.,13
NA,But we did not hear from the honorable,13
NA,member for Bourke a word about its,13
NA,findings.,13
Mr ANSTEY ,I s that true? I invite,13
NA,the honorable member to read the passage,13
NA,I have underlined in the Hansard re-,13
NA,port of my speech.,13
Mr CHARLTON ,Th e passage is as,13
NA,follows: -,13
NA,A board of inquiry was appointed to investi-,13
NA,"gate the case, its members being Colonel Wad-",13
NA,"dell and Major T. F. Knox, one of whom",13
NA,boasted that he was manager of the Colonial,13
NA,"Bank, and the other that he was managing",13
NA,director of Dalgety and Company; and they,13
NA,claimed that no reflection should be cast on,13
NA,them when they reported that this officer was,13
NA,not guilty of the charges brought against him.,13
NA,I at once concede that the honorable,13
NA,member mentioned that there was a,13
NA,Board of Inquiry into certain charges,13
NA,"preferred against Colonel Lee, and that",13
NA,it found that he was not guilty of them.,13
NA,But the point that I wish to emphasize is,13
NA,"that, i f the honorable member desired to",13
NA,do justice to this officer he certainly ought,13
NA,to have read from the official report of,13
NA,the Board of Inquiry the charges that,13
NA,"were made against him, and the findings",13
NA,of the Board. That is the position I,13
NA,take up.,13
Mr JH CATTS ,Bu t the honorable,13
NA,member said that he did not mention the,13
NA,Board's findings.,13
Mr CHARLTON , I have conceded,13
NA,that; but having mentioned that an,13
NA,"inquiry was held, he should have given",13
NA,the House thefindingsof the Board which,13
NA,made that inquiry. The honorable mem-,13
NA,ber has made his position much worse than,13
NA,"it was, because, at the outset of his",13
NA,"speech this morning, he said that, not-",14
NA,withstanding the facts placed before us,14
NA,"by the Assistant Minister of Defence, he",14
NA,saw no reason to withdraw from the posi-,14
NA,tion he had taken up with respect to the,14
NA,charges against Colonel Lee. A n d what,14
NA,was the position that he took up? He,14
NA,said last week-,14
NA,A court martial was refused. The Audit,14
NA,-_5 officers then recommended to the Govern-,14
NA,ment of the State that a criminal pro-,14
NA,secution for embezzlement should be com-,14
NA,"menced, but that application was smothered by",14
NA,social influence. I t is. the man against whom,14
NA,"these charges were made-Colonel , then Major,",14
NA,"Lee-wh o was appointed president of the""",14
NA,court martial constituted to try the Rabaul,14
NA,cases. He embezzled f 611 of the money of the,14
NA,"New South Wales Government, and the omcers",14
NA,of the Audit Department of the State recom-,14
NA,mended that he should be criminally prose-,14
NA,cuted. He was only saved from gaol by social,14
NA,influence.,14
NA,The honorable member charged this offi-,14
NA,cer with having embezzled,14
NA,money.,14
Mr ANSTEY ,Tha t is true.,14
Mr CHARLTON ,N o proof has.been,14
NA,adduced that Colonel Lee embezzled,14
NA,any money whatever.,14
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Ther e,14
NA,Brodie's statement.,14
Mr CHARLTON , I know sufficient,14
NA,of Mr Brodie to make me think twice,14
NA,about accepting all bhat he says. But I,14
NA,shall say no more of h i m ; I make no,14
NA,charge against any one.,14
NA,"saying: "" I n view of the findings of this",14
NA,"Board, I withdraw my charge against",14
NA,"Colonel Lee that he embezzled money,""",14
NA,the honorable member for Bourke re-,14
NA,iterates his allegation and says that the,14
NA,later information put before the House,14
NA,justifies the position he has taken up.,14
NA,H e has not receded i n the least from the,14
NA,ground he first occupied i n this matter.,14
NA,I f honorable members are going to avail,14
NA,themselves of their privilege to make such,14
NA,charges in this House when there is no,14
NA,"evidence to support them, what is going",14
NA,"to be the result ? I t was alleged, amongst",14
NA,"other things, that Colonel Lee had failed",14
NA,to produce vouchers for certain expendi-,14
NA,ture incurred by him while on active ser-,14
NA,vice. Every one will realize the difficulty,14
NA,of keeping vouchers for every penny ex-,14
NA,pended on the field of battle. When an,14
NA,officer is moving rapidly from place to,14
NA,place-whe n he has to look after the inte-,14
NA,"rests of those under him, and to make",14
NA,certain payments on their behalf while on,14
NA,the field of battle-i t is quite reasonable,14
NA,to assume that he w i l l not always be able,14
NA,to produce vouchers for all that he ex-,14
NA,pends. I venture to say that i f any of,14
NA,us were i n a similar position we should,14
NA,not be able to account for every penny,14
NA,that we spent.,14
Mr HAMPSON ,"W e cannot do i t , even,",14
NA,when electioneering.,14
Mr CHARLTON ,Quit e so; honor-,14
NA,able members are not able to account f o r,14
NA,every penny expended by them when con-,14
NA,ducting an election campaign. I rose be-,14
NA,cause I believe i n dealing out even-,14
NA,handed justice to every - member of the,14
NA,"community, and because I believe that",14
NA,those who are intrusted with commissions-,14
NA,in our Defence Forces-thos e who have to,14
NA,lead our men-shoul d not be badgered,14
NA,day after day without any justification at,14
NA,"a time like this, when the country is at",14
NA,war. As a member of the Labour party,14
NA,and of this House I shall always do my,14
NA,certain utmost to see that every one secures a fair,14
NA,"deal, and that the character of no man is",14
NA,"improperly assailed here, either directly",14
NA,"or by innuendo. When charges are made,",14
NA,they should be proved. I have never,14
NA,met Colonel Lee; I do not know him. B u t,14
NA,"is Mr considerations of justice appeal to me,",14
NA,"and justice, I think, should be done to",14
NA,this gentleman. No proof is forthcoming,14
NA,of the charge of embezzlement made,14
NA,"against him, and we should not, under",14
NA,"the protection of the House, make alle-",14
NA,Instead of gations against any man unless we can,14
NA,prove them. I f we are prepared to make,14
NA,"charges of this kind, we should make",14
NA,"them outside, and thus give the gentle-",14
NA,man concerned the opportunity to defend,14
NA,himself in the Courts of his country.,14
Mr JENSEN ,Bass-Assistan t M i n -,14
NA,ister of Defence) [11.27] -Th e honorable,14
NA,member f o r Bourke has taken up a cer-,14
NA,"tain attitude i n regard to this matter,",14
NA,and appears to be determined to persist,14
NA,"in i t . I n doing so, he is implying, i t",14
NA,"may be, quite unwittingly, that the Go-",14
NA,vernment allowed the recent court mar-,14
NA,tial i n Sydney to be conducted by officers,14
NA,who' were not fit to hold that position.,14
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Ther e is no doubt,14
NA,that that is the charge against the Go-,14
NA,vernment.,14
Mr JENSEN , I t is practically said,14
NA,that the Government have been conniv-,14
NA,ing with others in an attempt to smother,14
NA,up the alleged cases of looting at Rabaul.,14
NA,I may say at once that the Government,14
NA,"have confidence i n Colonel Lee, and i n",14
NA,every member of the court martial which,14
NA,"tried tlie looting cases. That being so, i t",15
NA,"i s our duty t a defend them, whenever the",15
NA,"necessity arises, on th© floor of this",15
NA,House. I feel very sorry for Colonel,15
NA,"Lee, whose name has been brought up i n",15
NA,"this House, where he has no chance of",15
NA,defending himself upon the charges made,15
NA,"against him, and I think i t is the duty",15
NA,-of the Government to go to' his rescue i f,15
NA,they think he has been wrongly treated.,15
NA,We take the view that he was quite fit to,15
NA,-occupy the position of President of the,15
NA,court martial recently held i n Sydney.,15
NA,I f we had had any suspicion regarding,15
NA,the charges levelled against him i n,15
NA,"1902-3-4-5, we should have moved",15
NA,"-quickly i n the matter. B u t, i n face of",15
NA,the report of the Board of Inquiry that,15
NA,investigated the charges made against,15
NA,"Colonel Lee, and which",15
NA,"exonerated him of all wrong-doing, i t is",15
NA,our duty to stand by him. I n dealing,15
NA,"with the whole of the Rabaul charges,",15
NA,the honorable member f o r Bourke has,15
NA,"used extraordinary language, and has seen",15
NA,fit actually to imply that the Government,15
NA,are withholding a certain paper. The,15
NA,House has been told that a copy of a cer-,15
NA,"tain confession, i n writing, was sent to",15
NA,"the Minister of Defence from Rabaul,",15
NA,and the honorable member has said that,15
NA,the Minister is withholding i t . The hon-,15
NA,orable member for Bourke desires to know,15
NA,"where the confession is, and where the",15
NA,copy of i t is.,15
Mr BURNS ,Tha t was stated i n evi-,15
NA,"dence, was i t not ?",15
Mr JENSEN ,I wish to inform the,15
NA,Committee of the facts in my own way.,15
NA,"The Minister of Defence, speaking in the",15
NA,"Senate some few days ago., gave honor-",15
NA,"able senators the impression,",15
NA,that he was quoting from some document,15
NA,"which he held, but he was not doing so.",15
NA,He was quoting from correspondence sent,15
NA,"to him from Rabaul by Colonel Holmes,",15
NA,and in that correspondence,15
NA,Holmes said that he was giving in his,15
NA,letter the gist of the confession.,15
NA,to make it clear to the Committee,15
NA,» there were not. three confessions signed by,15
NA,Campbell. Only one paper was signed by,15
NA,"him, but true copies of it were. made.",15
NA,One true copy was sent to. the Adminis-,15
NA,"trator, who should pass it on to the",15
NA,"Minister-, and another copy was retained",15
NA,"by Colonel Holmes, and sent to the",15
NA,Sydney Sun.,15
Mr BURNS ,The . Sun did. not receive,15
NA,the copy.,15
Mr JENSEN , I am stating the facts.,15
NA,The officers who were concerned i n that,15
NA,matter at Rabaul made a sworn declara-,15

Mr BURNS ,Wa s that one of the,15

NA,that Ministers were charged for being parties,17
NA,are to what was being done i n Sydney to,17

NA,cause we were promised a f u l l inquiry,17
NA,"into the allegations that have been made,",17
NA,and the honorable gentleman is pre-,17
Mr JENSEN , I have quoted the state-,17
NA,confesments of the men in prison.,17
Mr MCGRATH ,Thos e statements,17
NA,"should be made, not before this Com-",17
NA,"mittee, but before any Board or Select",17
NA,Committee appointed to inquire into thes-j,17
NA,We are waiting f or the report,17
NA,"of that inquiry, but i n a discussion re-",17
NA,and garding the finding of the Board which,17
NA,inquired into the charges against Colonel,17
NA,"Lee, the Minister has introduced a num-",17
NA,to ber of declarations regarding certain,17
NA,that statements made by the honorable mem-,17
NA,to ber for Bourke last week i n connexion,17
NA,with the offences at Rabaul. I repeat,17
NA,thab I regret that the Minister has in-,18
NA,"troduced those questions at this stage,",18
NA,because he is to some extent prejudging,18
NA,the inquiry that has been promised.,18
Mr JENSEN ,Th e honorable member,18
NA,for Bourke introduced the matter by,18
NA,mentioning Campbell's case to-day.,18
Mr MCGRATH ,Campbell' s case is,18
NA,apart altogether from the others.,18
NA,are concerned with two inquiries. One,18
NA,is to ascertain what has become of the,18
NA,original confession alleged to have been,18
NA,"made by Campbell, and which the As-",18
NA,sistant Minister admits cannot be found.,18
NA,He was quite right in dealing with that,18
NA,portion of the speech of the honorable,18
NA,"member for Bourke, but honorable mem-",18
NA,bers understood that the main charges in,18
NA,regard to what took place at Rabaul were,18
NA,being inquired into by the Attorney-,18
NA,"General. To-day, however, tlie Minister,",18
NA,is giving a partial statement.,18
Mr JENSEN ,Th e Attorney-General is,18
NA,only inquiring into the manner in whicn,18
NA,the military inquiries were conducted.,18
Mr MCGRATH ,I t is about time the,18
NA,"House took a stand, and insisted on an",18
NA,inquiry.,18
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I n what way?,18
Mr MCGRATH ,W e should have an,18
NA,inquiry by the members of this House,18
NA,into these charges.,18
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I f i t came to a,18
NA,"vote you would be absent, as you were",18
NA,last night.,18
Mr MCGRATH , I did not know a,18
NA,vote was to be taken. The Acting Prime,18
NA,Minister told me that i t would not be,18
NA,taken.,18
Mr TUDOR , I told you that the mo-,18
NA,tion was going to be withdrawn.,18
Mr MCGRATH ,An d I acted on that,18
NA,belief.,18
Mr TUDOR , I did not break faith,18
NA,with you.,18
Mr MCGRATH , I quite agree. We,18
NA,should certainly have a full inquiry. We,18
NA,have not been blaming tlie Government,18
NA,"for not expediting the inquiry, fully",18
NA,undeiBtanding that the Attorney-General,18
NA,and the Prime Minister were in Adelaide.,18
Mr JENSEN , The Attorney-General,18
NA,is only inquiring into all the evidence,18
NA,"and the way the court was constituted, to",18
NA,see whether the court carried out the in-,18
NA,quiry in a proper manner.,18
Mr MCGRATH , I understood that,18
NA,the Attorney-General was inquiring into,18
NA,the statements made by the honorable,18
NA,member for Bourke. We all understood,18
NA,that that was going to be done.,18
Mr BRENNAN , I thought i t was a pre-,18
NA,liminary inquiry to see what steps should,18
NA,be taken.,18
Mr JENSEN ,"No , i t was an inquiry",18
NA,"to see if the court, recently held in Syd-",18
NA,"ney, was a proper tribunal, and carried",18
NA,We out its functions properly; and whether,18
NA,it refused to admit evidence which i t,18
NA,should have accepted.,18
Mr MCGRATH ,"I f that is so, we are",18
NA,no further forward.,18
Mr JENSEN , The Attorney-General,18
NA,will then advise the Government what to,18
NA,do.,18
Mr MCGRATH ,W e understood that,18
NA,the Attorney-General was making pre-,18
NA,liminary inquiries to ascertain what form,18
NA,of inquiry should take place.,18
Mr TUDOR ,N o such thing.,18
Mr MCGRATH ,The n I have been,18
NA,under a misapprehension.,18
Mr JENSEN ,H e is to ascertain if the,18
NA,"inquiry was a proper one, and if justice",18
NA,was done.,18
Mr MCGRATH , I regret that the,18
NA,"whole question has had to be brought up,",18
NA,especially in view of some of the state-,18
NA,ments made by the Assistant Minister to-,18
NA,"day. I hope, for the sake of the honour",18
NA,"of the officers and soldiers of Australia,",18
NA,that those statements are true. What,18
NA,is going to be. done with Private Camp-,18
NA,bell ? The Minister has produced a sworn,18
NA,declaration that Campbell made a confes-,18
NA,sion ; surely the confession itself ought to,18
NA,be produced. We were told that i t was,18
NA,"forwarded to Colonel Holmes. I f so,",18
NA,Colonel Holmes ought to be able to pro-,18
NA,duce it. We ought to know why the,18
NA,confession was not produced at the court-,18
NA,martial. Private Campbell was found,18
NA,guilty of making a false statement. It,18
NA,was assumed that he had made a confes- -,18
NA,"sion, although the confession was never",18
NA,produced. Although the Assistant Min-,18
NA,ister could find time to defend Colonel,18
NA,"Lee, he uttered not a syllable in defence",18
NA,"of Private Campbell, who stands con-",18
NA,demned to-day for having uttered a false-,18
NA,"hood and then confessed, although there",18
NA,is no evidenceto show that he did so.,18
Mr JENSEN , I resent that. I would,18
NA,defend any private in the Army as well,18
NA,as a colonel.,18
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e honorable mem-,18
NA,ber can resent i t in a proper way b j,18
NA,speaking afterwaa-ds. He has no right,18
NA,to interrupt my speech.,18
Mr JENSEN ,On o would think from,19
NA,what the honorable member said that I,19
NA,"was here only to protect omcers, and not",19
NA,privates.,19
Mr MCGRATH , I wish to show the,19
NA,unfairness of what took place last night.,19
NA,The Assistant Minister of Defence last,19
NA,night tried to defend Colonel Lee. Let me,19
NA,remind him that the honorable member,19
NA,"for Bourke distinctly said, as the Hansard",19
NA,"report shows, that Colonel Lee was ac-",19
NA,quitted of the charges against him. Not-,19
NA,withstanding the remarks of the honor-,19
NA,"able member for Hunter, the honorable",19
NA,"member for Bourke was perfectly fair,",19
NA,because he said that the Court of Inquiry,19
NA,acquitted Colonel Lee.,19
Mr JENSEN ,H e also said the whole,19
NA,business was smothered up by social in-,19
NA,fluence.,19
Mr MCGRATH ,Wha t he did say,19
NA,"was that Inspector Brodie, who was the",19
NA,prosecutor at the Board of Inquiry into,19
NA,"the charges against Colonel Lee, stated",19
NA,"that there had not been a fair trial,",19
NA,and that he could not understand why,19
NA,Colonel Lee was not found guilty.,19
NA,Inspector Brodie asked for a criminal,19
NA,"prosecution, and staked his reputation",19
NA,"that, if a criminal prosecution was in-",19
NA,"stituted, or i f they could have a trial at",19
NA,which witnesses had to give sworn evi-,19
NA,"dence, Colonel Lee would be found guilty.",19
NA,The honorable member for Bourke quoted,19
NA,"Brodie's words; that is all he said, and",19
NA,I cannot understand why he should be,19
NA,now accused of being unfair to Colonel,19
NA,Lee. No one on this side wants to be,19
NA,unfair to a man simply because he is an,19
NA,". officer, but I agree with the honorable",19
NA,member for Bourke that Colonel Lee,19
NA,should never have accepted a position,19
NA,on the court martial. He is the last man,19
NA,who should have gone on i t.,19
Mr JENSEN ,I f Colonel Lee was not,19
NA,"fit to occupy that position, he was not",19
NA,fit to be in the Military Forces at all.,19
NA,"Mr MCGRATH,-Othe r very strong",19
NA,charges were made by the honorable mem-,19
NA,"ber for Bourke, particularly against",19
NA,"Lieutenant Ravenscroft, especially in re-",19
NA,gard to his career in England.,19
NA,answer has been made to those charges.,19
NA,All that the Assistant Minister did yes-,19
NA,terday was to quote a little more fully,19
NA,from the report from which the honorable,19
NA,member for Bourke had already quoted.,19
NA,Nobody listening to the honorable mem-,19
NA,ber for Bourke could for a moment be-,19
NA,lieve that he had said that the Board,19
NA,of Inquiry hadfound Colonel Lee,19
NA,guilty. He distinctly said that he was,19
NA,"found not guilty, and proceeded to quote",19
NA,the request of the prosecuting officer for,19
NA,a further trial with evidence on oath.,19
Mr JENSEN ,H e said the whole thing,19
NA,"was smothered up, and according to that",19
NA,finding i t was not smothered up.,19
Mr MCGRATH ,Th e least the Minis-,19
NA,ter says about smothering up the better.,19
NA,This matter has nothing to do with the,19
NA,present Government. I t occurred in,19
NA,"1904, and there are very strong reports",19
NA,current that the charges were .smothered,19
NA,up by social influence. The man who knew,19
NA,all about the case asked that i t be sub-,19
NA,"mitted to the Crown Law authorities, and",19
NA,further action taken. I guarantee that i f,19
NA,"Colonel Lee had been a private, further",19
NA,action would have been taken.,19
Mr JENSEN ,Nonsense ! Thousands,19
NA,of cases are submitted to the Crown Law,19
NA,"authorities, and no further action taken.",19
Mr MCGRATH , I will guarantee,19
NA,"that, where the prosecutor practically",19
NA,stakes his reputation that he will get a,19
NA,conviction if he can secure an ordinary,19
NA,"trial, with evidence taken on oath, there",19
NA,are not many cases of the kind which are,19
NA,not gone on with.,19
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [11.53] -,19
NA,We are not doing our country much good,19
NA,by canvassing these things. Unfortu-,19
NA,"nately, charges levelled against our own",19
NA,people in this place can be used to the,19
NA,disadvantage of our own race in neutral,19
NA,"countries, where our unscrupulous enemies",19
NA,are endeavouring to influence public,19
NA,opinion by fabricating untrue charges of,19
NA,atrocities against the allied troops.,19
Mr WEBSTER ,The y cannot say more,19
NA,than they are saying.,19
Mr KELLY ,"Ca n they not? Who,",19
NA,"without corroboration, would believe the",19
NA,lying press bureau of Berlin ? I am ready,19
NA,"to believe this question was raised, in the",19
NA,"first place, with the best intentions, in",19
NA,the belief that i t was the only means of,19
NA,getting justice,19
Mr MCGRATH ,Le t us have an in-,19
NA,"No quiry, and that will end it.",19
Mr KELLY , I urge honorable mem-,19
NA,bers to realize that in the United States,19
NA,of America a very strong press campaign,19
NA,is being carried on by the German Press,19
NA,Bureau to secure the support of the senti-,19
NA,mentalist opinion in that country against,19
NA,"the Allies, and that i t can do us and our",19
NA,race no good to have in this Parliament,19
NA,this constant canvassing of the honour of,20
NA,Australian troops. We should remember,20
NA,that i t never pays to wash dirty linen in,20
NA,public while an unscrupulous enemy looks,20
NA,on.,20
Dr MALONEY ,Melbourne) [11.55].,20
NA,- I do not quite agree with the honorable,20
NA,member for Wentworth. Looting has,20
NA,been the habit of all armies throughout,20
NA,"the world's history, and I know-a s one",20
NA,who was medical officer of a ship coming,20
NA,down on one occasion from China-tha t,20
NA,250 men were reputed on that boat to be,20
NA,bringing back 450 tons of loot. Now that,20
NA,the honorable member for .Bourke has,20
NA,"brought the question before the public, I",20
NA,hope this Parliament will insist that,20
NA,"either the Assistant Minister, or the",20
NA,"Prime Minister himself, shall make a",20
NA,"public statement that, no matter what rob-",20
NA,bery by soldiers or omcers has been al-,20
NA,"lowed in the past, i f , from this time",20
NA,"ward, any soldier or officer steals he shall",20
NA,go to prison. There can be no harm in,20
NA,that attitude. The great Arch-Duke who,20
NA,is leading the Russian armies is reported,20
NA,"to have said on one occasion-referring ,",20
NA,"I believe, to army contractors- "" He who",20
NA,"robs I hang.""",20
Mr KELLY ,D o not you think,20
NA,might trust our Minister to take the,20
NA,proper stand?,20
Dr MALONEY , I want from this,20
NA,time forth every officer and soldier to un-,20
NA,derstand that i f he steals he will be pun-,20
NA,ished. I would not try a dog by a,20
NA,"court martial, and I know no legal man",20
NA,who would advocate one. Have we not,20
NA,enough stipendiary magistrates and jus-,20
NA,tices to try cases without constituting,20
NA,courts martial? The honorable member,20
NA,for Bourke is not the only one who has,20
NA,obtained information. I know of matters,20
NA,"which I am keeping quiet, only waiting",20
NA,to get justice done quietly. Whenever a Africa.,20
NA,Bill has been brought in pertaining to,20
NA,"military matters, my stock question to the word against",20
NA,"Prime Minister has always been, "" Is",20
NA,civil law dominant over the military,20
NA,"law?"" Every time the answer has been",20
NA,""" Yes."" The Prime Minister said, from",20
NA,"his place in the House, that he would",20
NA,further than the honorable member for,20
NA,"Bourke, and say that an officer who public;",20
NA,would be guilty of looting was worse,20
NA,a private. I agree with the honorable,20
NA,"member for Bourke, that when a common",20
NA,"soldier is being tried, punishment very",20
NA,"speedily follows, but i f the offender is an",20
NA,officer he can escape. The Assistant Min-,20
NA,ister made a slip of the tongue in describ-,20
NA,ing the paper which the honorable mem-,20
NA,ber for Flinders has now in his hand as,20
NA,the record of a court martial. I t is,20
NA,"simply the report of an inquiry, and I",20
NA,had intended to read it fully last night.,20
NA,"Having handed it to Hansard, however,",20
NA,"I had not the opportunity to do so, but I",20
NA,saw sufficient of i t to come to the conclu-,20
NA,sion that i f ever there was a whitewash-,20
NA,"ing inquiry, it was that one. I do",20
NA,not think any legal man in this,20
NA,chamber would like to see a man,20
NA,tried on a document of that kind.,20
NA,"Even "" Judge Lynch "" in America is not,",20
NA,"in my opinion, so evil as a court martial;",20
NA,and about the latter form of inquiry all,20
NA,authorities speak severely. I know that,20
NA,if the honorable member for Angas,20
NA,speaks out in the direct honest way that,20
NA,"forhe usually does, ho will agree with me",20
NA,that trial by court martial should not be,20
NA,tolerated in Australia. One who had had,20
NA,an honorable career in South Africa was,20
NA,dismissed on an ex parte statement that,20
NA,"he had been tried for murder; and, but",20
NA,for the help I received from the Commis-,20
NA,sioner of Police and detectives i n Vic-,20
NA,"we toria, he would have been a disgraced",20
NA,man. And what trouble dfd I not have,20
NA,with the heads of the Department over,20
NA,"that case! I say emphatically that, if",20
NA,there is one Department that needs watch-,20
NA,"ing, i t is the Defence Department, where",20
NA,anything is done that a particular clique',20
NA,may desire. There are men here who are,20
NA,"colonels, but .who had not the pluck to",20
NA,volunteer for service in South Africa; and,20
NA,yet these creatures are given power and,20
NA,control.,20
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t cannot be,20
NA,"said about Colonel Lee, who was regarded",20
NA,as one of the best troop leaders in South,20
Dr MALONEY , I do not know,20
NA,Colonel,20
NA,"Lee, and I do not wish to say a",20
NA,him; but i f he had had any,20
NA,the decency he would not have taken the,20
NA,position of a judge. The inquiry to which,20
NA,reference has been made regarding that,20
NA,officer was not conducted by a County,20
NA,"go Court, a Supreme Court, or the High",20
NA,"Court tribunals, which are open to the",20
NA,"and letter after letter, and docu-",20
NA,"than ment after document, were produced",20
NA,confidentially. I feel confident that the,20
NA,Leader of the Opposition would not care,20
NA,"to be tried under such circumstances, nor",20
NA,would advocate the abolition of the ordi-,21
NA,nary courts of justice i n favour of the,21
NA,court martial. I do not question the,21
NA,"courage of Colonel Lee, who went to the",21
NA,f r o n t and fought; I am alluding to those,21
NA,made-up colonels who never went when,21
NA,"they had the chance. I could give names,",21
NA,but I do uot wish to labour the question.,21
NA,"While I am member for Melbourne, the",21
NA,"military authorities, so far as my vote",21
NA,"goes, shall not be given dominance over",21
NA,our civil life. I compliment the Assistant,21
NA,Minister of Defence on his splendid,21
NA,"efforts; indeed, i t seems to me that he has",21
NA,to do most of the work of the Depart-,21
NA,"meut, and I feel certain that he will keep",21
NA,a firm grasp of affairs. B u t I warn him,21
NA,that he will have to watch the Depart-,21
NA,ment. We must not forget that one trial,21
NA,"by court martial, over 100 years ago,",21
NA,caused a very sore feeling between,21
NA,England and America; and I am sure,21
NA,there is not a single honorable member who,21
NA,would advocate such a form of tria l for,21
NA,our fellow citizens. I hope that from this,21
NA,"time forth i t will be enunciated that, i f",21
NA,any looting or thieving is done by officer,21
NA,"or private, punishment will follow, and",21
NA,"that, while we have so many stipendiary",21
NA,"magistrates and Judges, no court martial",21
NA,shall be allowed i n Australia. I f we here,21
NA,"were i n a state of siege or of war, I could",21
NA,understand our having recourse to courts,21
NA,"martial, but is there any legal member",21
NA,opposite who would choose the average,21
NA,soldier as being a judge of the law of,21
NA,"evidence, or capable of adjudicating i n",21
NA,such cases 1 The Opposition contains more,21
NA,lawyers than we have on the Government,21
NA,"side, and i t is to them particularly that",21
NA,I have addressed my remarks. I f a court,21
NA,martial is good for a soldier i n times of,21
NA,"peace, i t should be good for the civilian;",21
NA,but who would dare to suggest the latter ?,21
NA,Though some of us may differ from the,21
NA,honorable member for Bourke as to his,21
NA,"method of introducing this subject, that",21
NA,gentleman has undoubtedly done some,21
NA,"good i n checking the military power, which",21
NA,apparently desires to control everything,21
NA,in Australia.,21
Mr JENSEN ,Bass-Assistan t M i n -,21
NA,ister) [12.5] -Th e honorable member for,21
NA,Illawarra just now stated that some,21
NA,months back he held a confession from,21
NA,the Department.,21
Mr BURNS , I did not say anything,21
NA,of the k i n d ; I said I had a copy of the,21
NA,letter that you read just now.,21
Mr JENSEN ,Th e honorable mem-,21
NA,"ber, I think, said tliat he held a confes-",21
NA,sion.,21
Mr BURNS , I did not say I held a,21
NA,confession; but I asked why the docu-,21
NA,ment I referred to had not been brought,21
NA,before the House previously.,21
Mr JENSEN ," A t any rate, the hon-",21
NA,orable member said that he held such a,21
NA,document; and I wish to show that the,21
NA,Department is doing everything openly,21
NA,"and above-board, and i n no way trying to",21
NA,conceal anything from Parliament.,21
Mr BURNS ,Th e 22nd February was,21
NA,the date of the letter.,21
Mr JENSEN ,"Yes , that is the date,",21
NA,and i t is as follows-,21
NA,"Department of Defence,",21
NA,"Melbourne, 22nd February, 1915.",21
NA,"DEAR SIR,",21
NA,With reference to your inquiry in Parliament,21
NA,"on 15th December, 1914, as follows :-",21
NA,Mr BURNS : To ask the Assistant Minis-,21
NA,"ter, representing the Minister for De-",21
NA,fence :-,21
NA,1. Whether his attention haB been,21
NA,called to a report in the Herald news-,21
NA,paper of the 4th inst. that two mem-,21
NA,bers of the Expeditionary Force on,21
NA,duty at Babaul had purchased two,21
NA,pairs of pyjamas from a local store-,21
NA,"keeper, and on opening them found in",21
NA,"each pair a note from a Mrs Dalton,",21
NA,"North Sydney, and Miss Stevens, of",21
NA,"Vauclnse, showing that the pyjamas",21
NA,had been donated to 'the Bed Cross,21
NA,League for the men serving at the,21
NA,front ?,21
NA,I am directed to inform you that the Adminis-,21
NA,trator was asked to institute inquiries into the,21
NA,"matter, and a copy of the report furnished",21
NA,oy him is forwarded herewith for your in-,21
NA,formation.,21
NA,"Yours faithfully,",21
NA,"T. TRUMBLE, Acting Secretary.",21
NA,"G. M. Burns, Esq., M.P.,",21
NA,"- Commonwealth Offices, Sydney.",21
Mr BURNS ,Tha t is an exact copy of,21
NA,what you read this morning.,21
Mr JENSEN , I have here a copy of,21
NA,the report sent by the Administrator of,21
NA,Rabaul to tbe Minister; and extracts,21
NA,from that were supplied to the honorable,21
NA,member for Illawarra. That report deals,21
NA,with the confession,21
Mr BURNS ,No; not the confession-,21
NA,only a letter to the Sun.,21
Mr JENSEN , I n any case the very,21
NA,fact that that report was sent by the,21
NA,"Administrator, Colonel Holmes, to the",21
NA,"Minister, shows that every attention was",21
NA,being given to the matter in Rabaul.,21
NA,The report contains the following: -,21
NA,My attention has been drawn to a paragraph,21
NA,"which appeared in a Sydney newspaper, the",21
NA,"Sun, dated 7th December, alleging that cer-",22
NA,tain garments which were forwarded by a,22
NA,Eed Cross Society in Australia for the use of,22
NA,hospital patients had been purchased at the,22
NA,English store at Rabaul by a man of the Force,22
NA,under my command. I immediately caused in-,22
NA,"quiries to be made into the matter, and find",22
NA,that the report in question has no foundation,22
NA,whatever in fact. The man referred to is,22
NA,"Private R. B. Campbell, and he is writing the",22
NA,following letter to the newspaper to correct,22
NA,the false report:-,22
NA,"Re the article in the .Sun, Monday, 7th",22
NA,"December, in reference to certain articles",22
NA,which were sold to one of the members of,22
NA,"the Expeditionary Force, you mentioned",22
NA,in your letter that the articles were pur-,22
NA,chased in an English store. As a matter,22
NA,"of fact, the articles mentioned were pur-",22
NA,chased from another member of the Force,22
NA,privately,22
NA,"Theu the report proceeds, as I read this",22
NA,morning-,22
NA,Certain parcels of goods were received from,22
NA,"tbe Red Cross Society, and went straight into",22
NA,the possession of the Principal Medical Officer,22
NA,"at the hospital, and had been used exclusively",22
NA,for the purpose for which they were sent.,22
NA,None of these articles were broached on the,22
NA,voyage or before unloading. I t may be that a,22
NA,man who had received these while a patient in,22
NA,"the hospital afterwards disposed of. them, but",22
NA,I; have been unable to ascertain whether this,22
NA,is so. Certainly the report as to the pyjamas,22
NA,having been purchased in an English store at,22
NA,"Rabaul is quite wrong, as there is no English",22
NA,"store in existence here, with the exception of",22
NA,"the Government store, under the control of my",22
NA,Supply Officer; and at this store nothing what-,22
NA,"ever is sold to the troops, and no pyjamas",22
NA,whatever have at any time been stored there.,22
NA,T. considered the report as published a serious,22
NA,reflection upon the honour of those under my,22
NA,"command, and is also a damper on the efforts",22
NA,of those good ladies who are doing so much at,22
NA,home for the comfort of the troops on service.,22
NA,I t is to be regretted that respectable news-,22
NA,papers should publish statements of this kind,22
NA,Before they had first established their facts. I,22
NA,have no hesitation in saying that this accusa-,22
NA,tion is entirely false.,22
NA,There is one other matter to which I,22
NA,should like to refer. The honorable,22
NA,member for Bourke introduced the name,22
NA,"of Adjutant-General Dodds, and, in",22
NA,"doing so, I think, cast some reflection on",22
NA,that officer. For the information of the,22
NA,"House, and i n order that the Adjutant-",22
NA,"General may be cleared of the allegations,",22
NA,made against him by the honorable mem-,22
NA,"ber for Bourke, I desire to read the fol-",22
NA,lowing document which is signed by the,22
NA,officer concerned: -,22
NA,In the Melbourne press of last Friday,22
NA,"morning, Mr Anstey, M.P., is reported to have",22
NA,"quoted in Parliament, on Thursday afternoon,",22
NA,"a minute of mine, dated 3rd February, 1015,",22
NA,as follows:-,22
NA,I t is not proposed to take any notice of,22
NA,the insinuations of the writer of the,22
NA,letter relative to the officers.,22
NA,Mr Jensen.,22
NA,"In quoting my minute, Mr Anstey failed to",22
NA,"state the whole paragraph, of my minute in",22
NA,"question, which reads as follows:-",22
NA,I t is not proposed to take any notice of,22
NA,the insinuations of the writer of the,22
NA,"letter, relative to the omcers of the Naval",22
NA,and Military Expeditionary Force. They,22
NA,are apparently made with the idea that the,22
NA,Department would be influenced in the de-,22
NA,"cision on these cases, in order to avoid a",22
NA,"scandal, and, being made in such a way,",22
NA,do not appear to be worthy of notice.,22
NA,The Adjutant-General goes on to say-,22
NA,I do not think that any fair-minded person,22
NA,"could fail to grasp the meaning of my minute,",22
NA,"which is, briefly, tliat,. notwithstanding Mr.",22
NA,"Anstey's representations, or those of his friends,",22
NA,I declined to recommend theiT release from gaol,22
NA,as the price of their hushing up a public scan-,22
NA,"dal. Had I done so, the probability is that",22
NA,nothing whatever would have been heard of the,22
NA,notorious Rabaul looting cases. In further ex-,22
NA,"planation of the "" half-truth "" quoted by Mr.",22
NA,"Anstey, attention is invited to the fact that at",22
NA,"the date of my minute, so far as I am aware,",22
NA,no allegation of looting was in the possession,22
NA,"of the Department, beyond the insinuation and",22
NA,"the threat of the thrice-convicted criminal, on",22
NA,whose behalf Mr Anstey appears to champion,22
NA,his case. More reliable information was re-,22
NA,"ceived by me at a subsequent date, since which",22
NA,time I have not spared myself to do everything,22
NA,in my power to bring any offender-oflice r or,22
NA,otlier rank-t o a trial.,22
NA,"By placing Mr Anstey's "" half-truth "" on re-",22
NA,"cord against me in Hansard, my reputation as",22
NA,"an Imperial oflicial is at stake, and it is re-",22
NA,spectfully requested that action be taken to,22
NA,"give equal publicity to the "" whole truth "" as",22
NA,"was given to the "" half-truth,"" if not in Par-",22
NA,"liament, at least, by means of the press. Other-",22
NA,"wise, without such contradiction, it is quite",22
NA,possible that another Mr Anstey of 1030 may,22
NA,quote the Parliamentary Record in Hansard,22
NA,against me.,22
NA,With regard to Mr Anstey's allegations that,22
NA,"my minute has been removed from the file, I",22
NA,know nothing of this. I am not concerned with,22
NA,the keeping of the departmental records. I am,22
NA,"of opinion, however, that this allegation is not",22
NA,"even a "" half-truth,"" and I have little doubt",22
NA,that the minute will be found in its proper,22
NA,place on the file to which it belongs.,22
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta),22
NA,[12.13] - I wonder now whether we can,22
NA,",get away f r o m this subject.",22
Mr JENSEN ,Ou r officers have to be,22
NA,cleared of these charges..,22
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t is so;,22
NA,but the Prime Minister has already pro-,22
NA,mised a f u l l and exhaustive inquiry into,22
NA,the whole of the charges.,22
Mr BURNS , I think we ought to have,22
NA,a Royal Commission.,22
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Whe n a state-,22
NA,"ment was made i n this House last Friday,",22
NA,the Prime Minister accepted the sugges-',22
NA,"tion, made on all sides of the House, that",22
NA,"there should be an inquiry, either by a",23
NA,"Royal Commission, constituted of mem-",23
NA,"bers of this House, or of a Judge of a",23
NA,"Supreme Court, or by some other",23
NA,"means, to sift the charges to the",23
NA,"bottom, and give an impartial verdict.",23
NA,"That is the inquiry we were promised,",23
NA,and the inquiry we are waiting for. I n,23
NA,"my opinion, i t is improper for us to be",23
NA,"raking up these details, - pending such in-",23
NA,"quiry and report. A t the same time,",23
NA,every possible despatch should mark the,23
NA,"proceedings, including, of course, the",23
NA,constitution of the Commission. There,23
NA,has been sufficient time to set an inquiry,23
NA,going; and I do not think the Ministry,23
NA,sufficiently realize the seriousness of the,23
NA,charges.,23
Mr JENSEN , Mr Garran is now deal-,23
NA,ing with the matter.,23
Mr JOSEPH COOK , Mr Garran?,23
NA,Mr Garran is not going to make the in-,23
NA,"quiry, is he?",23
Mr JENSEN ,H e is looking into the,23
NA,papers.,23
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,An d doubtless,23
NA,he will make some sort of recommenda-,23
NA,"tion, and then the Cabinet will have to",23
NA,make further inquiries. I t ought not to,23
NA,take two. days to get that inquiry going,23
NA,if the Government acted properly. In,23
NA,the meantime I want to call attention to,23
NA,another very serious aspect of this ques-,23
NA,"tion, which, in my judgment, towers in-",23
NA,finitely higher than questions of mere,23
NA,"discipline at home, and charges that go",23
NA,back ten or twelve years. Are we aware,23
NA,of the fact that the fate of the Empire to-,23
NA,day is at stake; that while we are talking,23
NA,about pyjamas the whole of the Empire's,23
NA,energies over yonder are-being directed,23
NA,to the settlement of the problem,23
NA,whether our national property shall be,23
NA,left to us intact or not? I do tliink i t,23
NA,is time we exhibited a better sense of,23
NA,proportion. I am not underrating the,23
NA,"importance of this inquiry, but I urge",23
NA,that we should first look after something,23
NA,infinitely bigger and infinitely more im-,23
NA,portant-th e national welfare of Aus-,23
NA,tralia as well as the welfare of the Em-,23
NA,pire as a whole. Have honorable mem-,23
NA,bers read the statement by the Minister of,23
NA,Defence published this morning? Have,23
NA,they read the cables which state that the,23
NA,Germans are pushing tlie Russian forces,23
NA,"back again, and have actually captured",23
NA,the strongly fortified place which was,23
NA,wrested from them several months ago?,23
NA,"All this time, and while all these big",23
NA,"issues are at stake over yonder, we here",23
NA,are directing our attention to trouble,23
NA,"arising over a pair of pyjamas, or upon",23
NA,something that happened ten or twelve,23
NA,years ago. I t seems to me that we have,23
NA,lost all sense of proportion. I invite,23
NA,honorable members now to leave tbis mat-,23
NA,ter alone for the present; we must trust,23
NA,the Government to sift i t to the bottom.,23
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Tha t is what,23
NA,they ought to do.,23
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I can only say,23
NA,that we are now waiting for the Govern-,23
NA,"ment to get a move on, and to inform this",23
NA,House of the facts at tlie very earliest,23
NA,"possible moment. Now, leaving this",23
NA,"matter for the present, let us consider",23
NA,the defence situation as a whole-. A,23
NA,"very serious position of affairs arises, in",23
NA,"my judgment, owing to the statement",23
NA,made by the Minister of Defence in the,23
NA,press this morning in his appeal for re-,23
NA,"cruits'. He is lowering the standard, and",23
NA,he is asking urgently for recruits. He,23
NA,says he cannot get enough to fill his re-,23
NA,inforcements. What does this mean?,23
NA,I t means that our men at the front are,23
NA,being slaughtered to-day faster than we,23
NA,can find men to take their places.,23
NA,Surely this is far more serious a thing,23
NA,than the question of a pair of pyjamas.,23
NA,This is the position which we ought to,23
NA,"face earnestly, and the sooner we face it",23
NA,the better.,23
Mr JENSEN ,Th e Government did not,23
NA,bring up tlie -question of the pyjamas.,23
NA,"We were attacked on it, and we had to",23
NA,speak.,23
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am not,23
NA,"blaming the Government at all, and I",23
NA,hope the honorable the Minister will not,23
NA,misunderstand me. I am asking the Go-,23
NA,vernment and the whole House to try,23
NA,to bring things into their true pros-,23
NA,"portion, and place these matters in their",23
NA,proper setting. I t appears to me that,23
NA,we are in the habit of getting hold of,23
NA,"some small detail in this House, and",23
NA,magnifying i t until i t fills the whole,23
NA,"horizon, but I hope we shall get away from",23
NA,"that practice now, and give our attention",23
NA,to something whichis far more serious.,23
NA,And why is i t serious! I am afraid for,23
NA,one thing that Australia is so far away,23
NA,from the scene of conflict that we have,23
NA,not yet got hold of the idea that we are,23
NA,fighting for the integrity of Australia.,23
Mr MATHEWS ,Ther e is the same,24
NA,"trouble in England, and they are only 30",24
NA,or 40 miles away.,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I know; but,24
NA,to a certain extent the position is accen-,24
NA,tuated even more in Australia. Let us,24
NA,not forget the fact that the Germans,24
NA,want Australia; that they want i t more,24
NA,than they want England.,24
NA,"Mr KING O'MALLEY -Hear , hear I",24
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I f tlie enemy,24
NA,"won out to-morrow, they would not want",24
NA,"to occupy England, but they would want",24
NA,"to occupy South Africa and Australia,",24
NA,"and, therefore, I urge that we are in-",24
NA,finitely more concerned in this war than,24
NA,"Great Britain even is or can be, so far as",24
NA,integrity of territory is concerned. We,24
NA,"are the stake in the issue, and that being",24
NA,"so, why is i t that after ten months of war",24
NA,"we have not more than 40,000 men in",24
NA,the fighting line to-day ?,24
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e Department can-,24
NA,not arm and uniform the men as fast as,24
NA,they enlist.,24
Mr BURNS ,"Ther e have been 83,000",24
NA,"volunteers, have there not?",24
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is true that,24
NA,"83,000 men have volunteered since the",24
NA,"beginning of the war, but we must not",24
NA,"lose sight of the fact that 10,000 have",24
NA,"put out of action, either by sickness,",24
NA,death or wounds. We must not forget,24
NA,"the wastage of war, and we must bend",24
NA,our energies to meet this want. I sup-,24
NA,"pose there are over 20,000 men in our",24
NA,"camps to-day, so that probably less than",24
NA,"60,000 men have actually been sent away,",24
NA,"and as 13,000 or 14,000 of that number",24
NA,"only went the other day, they are on the",24
NA,"water still, so thatactually we have not",24
NA,"got more than 40,000 in the firing line.",24
Mr BURNS ,Wha t do you suggest?,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t seems to me,24
NA,that we have the notion somehow that,24
NA,"we are going to lick the world, but I am",24
NA,afraid we are looking at this war through,24
NA,the wrong end of the telescope.,24
Mr BURNS , I do not believe anybody,24
NA,thinks that.,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e position is,24
NA,very serious. . We want every man we,24
NA,can get at the earliest possible moment.,24
NA,Why is i t that recruiting has slackened,24
NA,off? The honorable member for Bourke,24
NA,said just now i t is because of the feeling,24
NA,that the men could not get justice.,24
Mr MATHEWS ,Tha t has a good deal,24
NA,to do with it .,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am uot mak-,24
NA,ing any suggestions in regard to these,24
NA,"charges, but I am saying that if there",24
NA,be anything in the matter at all i t is,24
NA,owing to the way that we magnify these,24
NA,small and trumpery things. We appear,24
NA,to fail to get the whole situation in its,24
NA,proper perspective.,24
Mr THOMAS ,Lik e that letter read by,24
NA,"the honorable member for Balaclava, for",24
NA,instance.,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is infinitely,24
NA,more important that we should give,24
NA,attention to the bigger things than to,24
NA,something which happened ten or twelve,24
NA,years ago.,24
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e Government hava,24
NA,done right with regard to the Broad-,24
NA,meadows Camp trouble.,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I admit that,24
NA,the health of the troops ought to be the,24
NA,subject of earnest non-party discussion,24
NA,in this House.,24
Mr BURNS ,"Yes , but exaggerations",24
NA,should not be allowed.,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Ther e always,24
NA,will be exaggeration until the end of,24
NA,"time, but we ought notto allow these",24
NA,smaller matters to fill the whole horizon,24
NA,so far as the future of this war is con-,24
NA,been cerned. Do not let us forget that while,24
NA,our enemies have their teeming millions,24
NA,"in the field, we have not been able iu",24
NA,"ten months to put more than 30,000 or",24
NA,"40,000 into the firing line. I submit,",24
NA,"therefore, that all our efforts should oe",24
NA,concentrated on the equipment of more,24
NA,"men for the front, and in fitting them",24
NA,to meet the enemy. That is the thinn,24
NA,that we have to consider. While the,24
NA,Government are inquiring into the,24
NA,"charges that have been made, I plead that",24
NA,these matters should not occupy the whole,24
NA,of their attention. Why is recruiting,24
NA,falling off? I want to say in the most,24
NA,friendly way that I do not think the,24
NA,Government themselves are blameless in,24
NA,"this matter, for i t appears to me that",24
NA,they have adopted an attitude of com-,24
NA,"placency, and in all their public state-",24
NA,ments they have not indicated to the,24
NA,public outside the real gravity of the,24
NA,"situation. Recruiting, so the Minister",24
NA,"tells us, has shown a marked falling off",24
NA,lately. Is this to be wondered at in,24
NA,view of the fact that while Parliament is,24
NA,sitting here to-day the chief members of,24
NA,the Government are away in another and,24
NA,distant part of the Commonwealth formu-,24
NA,lating a party programme.,24
Mr MATHEWS ,Ca n you not see,25
NA,well-being of Australia in that?,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I say that any-,25
NA,thing relating to the welfare of the people,25
NA,should just now be subordinated to the,25
NA,safety of the people as a whole. What,25
NA,would be the good of discussing all your,25
NA,"party programmes, and all your schemes",25
NA,"for the social welfare of the people, if",25
NA,the Prussians come here and take posses-,25
NA,sion of our country?,25
NA,NA,25
Mr JENSEN ,Th e absence of the Min-,25
NA,isters is not responsible for the falling,25
NA,off in recruits.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I submit that,25
NA,the responsible Ministers would be better,25
NA,employed trying to get recruits than dis-,25
NA,cussing the question of the division of,25
NA,powers between the States and the Com-,25
NA,monwealth.,25
Mr FENTON ,Bu t you held a general,25
NA,election when the war itself broke out.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e honorable,25
NA,member knows quite well that the general,25
NA,"election was decided on, and was in pro-",25
NA,"gress, when war broke out; and, in view",25
NA,"of what took place since, he ought not to",25
NA,"complain, because his party benefited by",25
NA,that election.,25
Mr FENTON ,"Oh , I am not sorry.",25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,The n why does,25
NA,the honorable member not hold his tongue,25
NA,about it? He has violated every state-,25
NA,ment made by the Attorney-General.,25
Mr BKENNAN ,"I n my view, we should",25
NA,"go on with business, and not put up the",25
NA,shutters.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Doe s the hon-,25
NA,orable member believe that the country,25
NA,should be shocked from end to end by,25
NA,party strife and. warfare? -,25
Mr BKENNAN ,No .,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e whole of,25
NA,the people outside do not think that we,25
NA,should do anything of the kind. This is,25
NA,"the only Parliament, so far as I know,",25
NA,where party strife takes place at this,25
NA,period in the history of the Empire. I t,25
NA,is the only part of the whole Empire,25
NA,where the energies of Parliament are not,25
NA,concentrated upon the prosecution of the,25
NA,war and the carrying of i t to a final and,25
NA,"complete success. I urge, therefore, that,",25
NA,instead of talking about party pro-,25
NA,grammes which will plunge this couiitrv,25
NA,"into political warfare, the leaders of the",25
NA,Government ought to be here attending to,25
NA,those urgent and vital national matters,25
NA,to which the Minister of Defence called,25
NA,the our attention this morning. How can we,25
NA,expect the people outside to regard the,25
NA,"war as being so serious, and the need for",25
NA,"men so urgent, when the leaders of the",25
NA,Government themselves take so com-,25
NA,placent a view of the present military,25
NA,situation ?,25
Mr MATHEWS ,W e do not forget that,25
NA,the exploiters are robbing the people dur-,25
NA,ing the war.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Al l I have to,25
NA,say is that the Government have the power,25
NA,to stop the exploiters in a time like this.,25
NA,Nobody here wants to see the people ex-,25
NA,ploited?,25
Mr MATHEWS ,Yo u know we have not,25
NA,the power.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I know the Go-,25
NA,vernment have the power; but the honor-,25
NA,able member's party deliberately turned,25
NA,down the only serious effort yet made to,25
NA,stop exploitation.,25
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -W e have not,25
NA,the courage to do it.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,A n earnest,25
NA,attempt was made in the early stages of,25
NA,the war to stop exploitation by the ap-,25
NA,pointment of three of the ablest and most,25
NA,disinterested men in this country as a,25
NA,Commission to make inquiries and ad-,25
NA,vise the Government upon any action that,25
NA,might have been necessary. These men,25
NA,"possessed as much business ability, acu-",25
NA,"men, intelligence, and experience for the",25
NA,conduct of inquiries of this sort as could,25
NA,be found in any part of Australia. We are,25
NA,told contemptuously by the Minister of,25
NA,"Trade and Customs that they did nothing,",25
NA,and did it well. They sat for thirty-six,25
NA,"days in about six weeks, sent in I do not",25
NA,"know how many reports, a,nd all they get",25
NA,is an unworthy sneer from the little man,25
NA,opposite.,25
Mr TUDOR ,I f I said anything about,25
NA,the honorable gentleman's personal ap-,25
NA,"pearance, he would strongly object.",25
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I may tell the.,25
NA,Minister of Trade and Customs that I do,25
NA,not speak altogether in a physical sense,25
NA,when I so describe him. When the hon-,25
NA,orable gentleman talks about these men,25
NA,"in the way he does, I think i t is time",25
NA,that some reply was made to him. I,25
NA,say that the members of the Commission,25
NA,are three of the ablest men in Australia,25
NA,"to-day, and there is no honorable member",25
NA,"on the other side who, if spoken to pri-",25
NA,"vately, would not admit that it would be",25
NA,impossible to pick a better business man,25
NA,than Mr Dugald Thomson for an inquiry,26
NA,of this sort. The Commission was con-,26
NA,temptuously rejected and thrown aside.,26
NA,I want to put on record what the members,26
NA,of the Commission were appointed to,26
NA,do-,26
NA,Enow ye tbat We do by these Our Letters,26
NA,Patent appoint you to be Commissioners to,26
NA,inquire into and from time to time report upon,26
NA,the supply of foodstuffs and other necessaries,26
NA,of life required by and available for the people,26
NA,"of Australia during the war, and from time to",26
NA,"time report upon ""the amounts of such food-",26
NA,stuffs and necessaries available or likely to be,26
NA,"available for export, having regard to the re-",26
NA,"quirements of Australia, and also to .report",26
NA,upon any matters relating to the conditions,26
NA,of trade and industry arising out of the war,26
NA,"which, in your opinion, should be brought",26
NA,under the attention of His Excellency's ad-,26
NA,visers.,26
NA,Here were three of the ablest men I could,26
NA,find in Australia appointed to be the eyes,26
NA,and the ears of the Government with,26
NA,"broad commission purposely vague, so",26
NA,that they might inquire into anything,26
NA,they thought fit to inquire into.,26
Mr MATHEWS ," A n d to report to us,",26
NA,who have no power to deal with their re-,26
NA,ports.,26
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t is abso-,26
NA,lute nonsense. Under the War Precau-,26
NA,tions A c t the Government have supreme,26
NA,power i n this country over everything,26
NA,that associates itself with the conduct,26
NA,"the war. I ,say that the only serious effort",26
NA,yet made was made i n the early days of,26
NA,"the war, and, to the eternal discredit",26
NA,"the present Government, they flung",26
NA,opportunities' for action afforded by,26
NA,appointment of the Commission contemptover these troublous times.,26
NA,uously away. The Minister of,26
NA,and Customs says that they did so because,26
NA,the Commission were doing nothing. He,26
NA,could do the work twenty times better!,26
NA,"A f t e r all that the Government are doing, business.",26
NA,the honorable members on their own side,26
NA,are up i n arms about the way things are,26
NA,going on.,26
Mr BRENNAN ,Doe s the right honorof,26
NA,able gentleman expect us to exercise now,26
NA,the powers which he refused to give us by,26
NA,referendum ?,26
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I want my hon-,26
NA,orable friends opposite to exercise the,26
NA,powers they have got to protect the people.,26
NA,I t is of no use to give them all the powers,26
NA,they want i f they will not use them.,26
NA,NA,26
NA,General says we have not the power.,26
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I suppose that,26
NA,ends i t . There are other men whose,26
NA,opinion on the subject is equal to t h a t,26
NA,"of the Attorney-General, who say .that ithe",26
NA,Government have the necessary powers.,26
NA,NA,26
NA,to hear the ex-Attorney-General on that,26
NA,point.,26
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e ex-Attor-,26
NA,ney-General would not tell the honorable,26
NA,member that in a time of war the Go-,26
NA,vernment cannot control the foodstuffs of,26
NA,the people. What are the Government,26
NA,doing ? That is a fair question to ask.,26
NA,Our friends opposite say that the cost of,26
NA,"living is towering up, that there are",26
NA,cornerers and exploiters abroad i n Aus-,26
NA,tralia. What are they doing about i f f,26
NA,"Where are the exploiters, and what are",26
NA,their names? They have shown what,26
NA,they want to do i n these .matters. Noth-,26
NA,ing could be more eloquent on that point,26
NA,a than the statement of the Attorney-,26
NA,'General on t i e sugar question the other,26
NA,day. I f ever .a man went into & case to,26
NA,"get a political argument out of i t , the",26
NA,honorable gentleman did then.,26
Mr RILEY ," A n d he got one, too.",26
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I f he did get,26
NA,"one, the bottom has been knocked out of",26
NA,i t already. I t has been shown that the,26
NA,"honorable gentleman's facts, as well as",26
NA,"of his inferences, were wrong. The Attorney-",26
NA,"General would have been well advised, i n",26
NA,"my opinion, i f he had consulted with Mr .",26
NA,"of Knox, and had tried to induce h i m, with",26
NA,"the all his machinery and his ability, to",26
NA,"the act on his side, and help the Government",26
NA,He should,26
NA,Trade have left the question of running Mr .,26
NA,Knox to earth and nationalizing the i n -,26
NA,dustry of his company u n t i l afterwards.,26
Mr KING OMALLEY , T h a t would be,26
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t would,26
NA,"have been business, but i t was too good a",26
NA,political opportunity to let go. Instead,26
NA,seeking the welfare of the people i n a,26
NA,f a i r and reasonable way ; instead of using,26
NA,the resources of the Government to secure,26
NA,"cheap food, and plenty of i t , f o r the",26
NA,"people, the whole inquiry by the Attorney-",26
NA,General seems to have begun and ended,26
NA,i n a desire to make a political argument,26
NA,for what is to come later.,26
Mr MATHEWS , Mr Knox would sell,26
NA,sugar at £25 per ton i f he had the power.,26
Mr JOSEPH COOK , A l l I have to,26
NA,say to that is that the Labour people i n,26
NA,Hew Soutli Wales have told Mr Knox,27
NA,that £25 per ton is a fair price for sugar.,27
Mr MATHEWS ,W e get it here at,27
NA,2s. 6d. per ton.,27
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Honorabl e matter of foodstuffs.,27
NA,members opposite should not lose sight of,27
NA,the fact that the result of all their regugentleman,27
NA,lating of prices is to send the price of ing martial law?,27
NA,"everything up, and they will not be able",27
NA,to regulate it down. They are building,27
NA,"up more corners in Australia, and causing",27
NA,"more exploitation, than was ever known",27
NA,in the history of this country before.,27
Mr RILEY ,Tha t ought to suit the,27
NA,honorable gentleman's party.,27
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t does not suit,27
NA,my party. I say that our first considerato,27
NA,tion in these troubled times should be,27
NA,poor man and his home. He ought to raise,27
NA,f i l l our horizon. I fervently believe that brings me to another point.,27
NA,in all that our friends opposite are doing,27
NA,in mixing up politics with their war arwere,27
NA,rangements they are only hurting the,27
NA,men they are supposed to be representing,27
NA,in this House. I wish to say that the,27
NA,"Commission I appointed, of independent, that we could get more rifles.",27
NA,"able, and disinterested men, would have",27
NA,gone further to provide a solution of,27
NA,these troubles than anything honorable,27
NA,members opposite have been able to do,27
NA,the nine months since they contemptuthat,27
NA,ously dismissed that Commission. My,27
NA,first charge against the Government is,27
NA,that they flung away the only opportunithe,27
NA,ties so far made available to them for the,27
NA,purpose of collecting foodstuffs and,27
NA,lating their distribution before and,27
NA,ing the war in the interests of the people.,27
Mr JH CATTS , I should like,27
NA,"know whether the right, honorable gen^ showed",27
NA,tleman's Government came to the concluand,27
NA,sion that they would have the power,27
NA,act upon the reports of the Commission,27
NA,on the instructions given to them..,27
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I will tell the,27
NA,honorable member what my Government do,27
NA,"thought, and what I thought myself.",27
Mr JH CATTS ,Wa s i t concurred,27
NA,by the ex-Attorney-General ?,27
Mr JOSEPH COOK," I do not know,",27
NA,I am sure. The honorable member had,27
NA,better put the ex-Attorney-General,27
NA,box and question him.,27
Mr JH CATTS ,Th e opinion of,27
NA,"the ex-Attorney-General, if given at",27
NA,"time, was important.",27
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,W e thought,27
NA,setting up that Commission that i t was,27
NA,our bounden duty to mobilize the whole,27
NA,of the resources of Australia upon a war,27
NA,"£21 footing, with a view to conserving the",27
NA,"interests of the people, particularly in the",27
Mr MATHEWS ,Coul d the honorable,27
NA,have done i t without proclaim-,27
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Yo u will never,27
NA,do anything if you do not try. The,27
NA,honorable member will never do anything,27
NA,by sitting here and making interjections.,27
NA,"For heaven's sake, run a risk or two, will",27
NA,"you, in the interests of the people of Aus-",27
NA,tralia? Do not come here and expect,27
NA,"every "" i "" to be dotted, and every "" t """,27
NA,be crossed before you do anything.,27
NA,the People who do not want to act always,27
NA,these preliminary difficulties. That,27
NA,We have,27
NA,been told by responsible Ministers that,27
NA,we could not get any more rifles than we,27
NA,"getting, and that the Government",27
NA,were doing the best they could. We set,27
NA,"up two Committees of this House, and both",27
NA,have unanimously come to the conclusion,27
NA,After,27
NA,being ridiculed and jeered at as I have,27
NA,all been for months because of the state-,27
NA,ments I have made regarding our pre-,27
NA,"in parations for war, and after being told",27
NA,"I was talking hot air, these same",27
NA,Ministers say now that we can get two-,27
NA,"shifts at work at Lithgow, and can increase",27
NA,output of the rifles. I say that a very,27
NA,serious responsibility is resting upon Min-,27
NA,reguisters forhaving the Small Arms Factory,27
NA,durworking only one shift for ten months,27
NA,when we now learn that i t might have,27
NA,<,27
NA,to been working two shifts.* The inquiry,27
NA,thab we could increase the output,27
NA,of rifles by 70 per cent. I go further,27
NA,say that the output could be increased,27
NA,to by 100 per cent. An increase of 70 per,27
NA,"cent, is admittedly a cautious and conser-",27
NA,"vative estimate, no doubt rightly made",27
NA,"by men charged with responsibility, but",27
NA,not honorable members think that i t is,27
NA,"time we had that increased output, and",27
NA,in that we sent the rifles away to the front,27
NA,"with 70 per cent, more men instead of",27
NA,leaving one man in the trenches to do the,27
NA,work of three men? That is the serious,27
NA,in the aspect of this question.,27
NA,The honorable member's time having,27
NA,"the expired, leave to continuegranted.",27
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I shall not,27
NA,in occupy very much more time. I wish to,27
NA,"say briefly that, in my opinion, instead",27
NA,of this Parliament being engaged in party,28
NA,"warfare, and the formulation of party",28
NA,programmes,28
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e honorable gentle-,28
NA,man made some very good party utter-,28
NA,ances just now.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I ask the hon-,28
NA,orable member to read the speech in cold,28
NA,print and say what he can find of a party,28
NA,nature in it . I venture to say that he,28
NA,has made more party speeches against the,28
NA,present Government than I have made.,28
Mr MATHEWS , Surely that is,28
NA,anomalous.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is. We have,28
NA,"sat silent for months and months, so as",28
NA,not to disturb or interfere with tho,28
NA,Government.,28
Mr BURNS ,No t even by asking ques-,28
NA,tions for one and a half hours every day.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,While the hon-,28
NA,orable member for Melbourne Ports and,28
NA,his sturdy fighters at the back have been,28
NA,assailing the Government day in and,28
NA,"day out, let him not talk about anybody",28
NA,indulging in party warfare.,28
Mr MATHEWS , I simply said that th«,28
NA,honorable member was endeavouring to,28
NA,make party capital out of this matter.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am not trying,28
NA,to do so. I am asking the Government,28
NA,to make i t possible for us to remain,28
NA,"behind them in this war, and to stop this-",28
NA,"fratricidal struggle within, for the pur-",28
NA,pose of enabling us effectively to deal,28
NA,with our enemies without. We can havo,28
NA,"our fight later, but at the present time",28
NA,every ounce of our strength should be,28
NA,pressed into the prosecution of this war.,28
NA,To avoid sending a man or a gun tha'.,28
NA,we can send to aid in the fight which is,28
NA,now going on in the Dardanelles is a,28
NA,criminal thing. The fact remains that,28
NA,we have there an army of brave men,28
NA,holding up a foe whose numbers are,28
NA,largely in excess of their own. While,28
NA,we are looking on complacently we ought,28
NA,to read the statement made by the re-,28
NA,sponsible Minister this morning in his,28
NA,appeal for recruits. Por what is it an,28
NA,appeal ? I t is not an - appeal to in-,28
NA,crease the standing army in the field.,28
NA,He does not make an appeal to increase,28
NA,our effective fighting forces in the field.,28
NA,"He says, "" Although no new units may",28
NA,"at present be under organization."" There",28
NA,are no new units in contemplation at all.,28
NA,He cannot get sufficient men to replenish,28
NA,the wastage of war. There are not,28
NA,enough recruits presenting the'mselyes for,28
NA,reinforcements alone.,28
Mr WISE ,I s not the severe medical,28
NA,examination deterring a lot of men from,28
NA,volunteering? I know of a case of a,28
NA,miner who came 200 miles to Melbourne,28
NA,"to enlist, and who was rejected because of",28
NA,his defective back teeth.,28
Mr RICHARD FOSTER ,Th e trouble is,28
NA,that we have not the equipment.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,Opposition call the honorable member for,28
NA,Wakefield a loyal man when he makes,28
NA,"a statement of that sort, and allows it",28
NA,to get into the newspapers? He wants,28
NA,scourging.,28
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Th e Minister of,28
NA,Defence says that his statement is true.,28
The CHAIRMAN , I appeal to hon-,28
NA,orable members to assist me to carry out,28
NA,my duties. I t is very important that,28
NA,I should hear what the honorable mem-,28
NA,ber who is addressing the Committee is,28
NA,saying. I t is also important that I,28
NA,should hear any statement to which ex,28
NA,ception may be taken. Now I under-,28
NA,"stand that some statement has been made,",28
NA,"which, in the medley of voices i t was",28
NA,impossible for me to catch. I ask hon-,28
NA,orable members to assist me to discharge,28
NA,"my duties, otherwise I shall be compelled",28
NA,to take another course.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,Germans.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I will tell the,28
NA,honorable member for Maranoa frankly,28
NA,that my opinion is that we have not suffi-,28
NA,"cient rifles and sufficient equipment. In,",28
NA,saying that I am merely saying what is,28
NA,being said all over the Empire. The,28
NA,public know well enough that we are not,28
NA,overflowing with munitions of war.,28
NA,Everybody knows quite the contrary.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,when war was declared you had no re-,28
NA,serve ammunition.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I was not,28
NA,aware that there had been any lack of,28
NA,ammunition.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,matter.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e honorable,28
NA,member may have two says. He may,28
NA,blame us as he likes. I do not care,28
NA,about that.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,ing.,28
The CHAIRMAN , I must ask the,28
NA,honorable member to withdraw that state-,28
NA,ment.,28
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Somethin g,29
NA,than a withdrawal is required.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,sort. I will not withdraw the statement.,29
The CHAIRMAN , I appeal to the,29
NA,honorable member,29
NA,NA,29
NA,"pens, I will not withdraw i t . I do not care",29
NA,what is done with me. Half of them over,29
NA,"there, and especially Foster, ought to be",29
NA,shot. H e wants interning.,29
The CHAIRMAN , M a y I make an-,29
NA,other appeal to the honorable member,29
NA,to withdraw his statement?,29
NA,NA,29
NA,what you do.,29
The CHAIRMAN ,-The n the honor-,29
NA,able member compels me to do my duty.,29
NA,I name the honorable member for,29
NA,Maranoa.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,statement in public like that made by the,29
NA,honorable member f o r Wakefield wants,29
NA,something done to h i m . I would settle,29
NA,him i f I were Minister of Defence.,29
NA,would have him with the Germans at,29
NA,Langwarrin. That is his proper place.,29
Mr TUDOR , I feel sure that every,29
NA,honorable member regrets as much as I,29
NA,do the duty which has been forced upon,29
NA,me. A n interjection was made by the,29
NA,honorable member for Wakefield to which,29
NA,the honorable member f o r Maranoa has,29
NA,taken exception,29
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , W i l l the M i n -,29
NA,ister of Trade and Customs repeat my,29
NA,interjection ?,29
Mr TUDOR , I did not hear i t . U n -,29
NA,"fortunately, the Committee was a little",29
NA,excited at the time. Honorable members,29
NA,"were engaged in cross-firing,",29
NA,orable member for Wakefield made an i n -,29
NA,terjection to which the honorable memhonorable,29
NA,ber for Maranoa took exception. I do not ment.,29
NA,know what that interjection was.,29
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wh y not,29
NA,honorable member for Wakefield say what,29
NA,i t was?,29
Mr TUDOR , I f the honorable member,29
NA,"for Wakefield will withdraw his interjecexplanation,",29
NA,"tion, and the honorable member f o r",29
NA,Maranoa will also withdraw his statesaid,29
NA,"ment, the Committee will be extricated",29
NA,from a very difficult position. I believe,29
NA,that the honorable member for Maranoa,29
NA,will withdraw his statement i f the honorwhat I said.,29
NA,able member for Wakefield will withdraw,29
NA,his interjection.,29
NA,[136],29
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , B u t the honor-,29
NA,able member for Maranoa has been,29
NA,named.,29
Mr TUDOR ,"Then , unfortunately, I",29
NA,am forced into the position of moving,29
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Ma y I suggest that,29
NA,the Chairman should ask the honorable,29
NA,member for Wakefield what he said ?,29
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , H e said exactly,29
NA,what you said immediately afterwards.,29
Mr TUDOR ,The n I ask the honor-,29
NA,able member for Maranoa to withdraw the,29
NA,statement to which objection has been,29
NA,"taken, and I feel sure that the honorable",29
NA,member for Wakefield will then withdraw,29
NA,anything that he said.,29
Mr RICHARD FOSTER , I w i l l not.,29
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ,Th e statement of,29
NA,the honorable member f o r Maranoa was,29
NA,a serious accusation against every honor-,29
NA,able member on this side of the chamber.,29
NA,I t involved everybody.,29
Mr TUDOR ,The n I ask the honorable,29
NA,member for Maranoa to withdraw i t .,29
NA,NA,29
NA,"I should be shot, but the lot of them.",29
Mr TUDOR , I ask the honorable mem-,29
NA,ber to withdraw the statement he has,29
NA,made concerning honorable members op-,29
NA,"posite, otherwise I shall be compelled to",29
NA,"submit a motion which I shall regret, and",29
NA,"which, I am .sure, he himself will regret",29
NA,upon calmer reflection.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,of the Minister,29
Sir ROBERT BEST ,D o not put i t i n,29
NA,that way.,29
Mr TUDOR ,Pu t i t i n any way you,29
NA,like.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,"this subject-muc h more strongly, per-",29
NA,"haps, than a number of honorable mem-",29
NA,and the honbers i n this chamber.,29
The CHAIRMAN , O r d e r ! I ask the,29
NA,member to withdraw his state-,29
NA,NA,29
NA,let the gize f o r having made i t .,29
NA,Sitting suspended from 12.57 to 2.15 p.m.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,sir. I beg to apologize to,29
NA,tlie Leader of the Opposition for what I,29
NA,just before we rose f o r luncheon. I,29
NA,can assure the honorable member that I,29
NA,did not mean i t . I apologize to honor-,29
NA,"able members of the Opposition, too, f o r",29
Mr JOSEPH COOK , We were all,29
NA,sure that the honorable member did not,29
NA,mean what he said. It was one of those,30
NA,"ebullitions which come out sometimes, and",30
NA,"arise, as I believe, from a very rare, very",30
NA,"genuine, and loyal attachment on the part",30
NA,of the honorable member to the in-,30
NA,"terests of the Empire, which I am sure",30
NA,"blinds him, even to the necessity for",30
NA,frank criticism sometimes concerning the,30
NA,preparation for the defence of that Em-,30
NA,pire. The honorable member may dis-,30
NA,abuse his mind of anything on this side,30
NA,which would seem to suggest to him that,30
NA,there is any sting or resentment left; we,30
NA,know him too well for that. The question of,30
NA,"munitions is, perhaps, the most trouble-",30
NA,some question that the Empire has to,30
NA,face to-day. It is the question of ques-,30
NA,"tions for the whole of the Allies, and it",30
NA,has been so stated by the responsible men,30
NA,"of the Empire. Jellicoe says, "" I cannot",30
NA,"get my ships in trim, because I cannot",30
NA,"get them fixed up properly.""",30
NA,"says, "" It is a simple problem-men",30
NA,"munitions, but munitions,",30
NA,"munitious."" Kitchener says, "" I must",30
NA,"have munitions."" Responsible",30
NA,"after consultation with the authorities, in",30
NA,"the Old Country, are saying that the",30
NA,"problem is "" Munitions,"" and that men",30
NA,at the war are being,30
NA,slaughtered from the want of them. There,30
NA,can be no good in trying to hide these,30
NA,facts from the population df,30
NA,Everybody knows that we-have not enough,30
NA,"munitions, and, to cap it all, two Com-",30
NA,mittees comprising sixteen members in,30
NA,all out of our. comparatively,30
NA,"liament, have said unanimously that we",30
NA,have not been doing what we should in,30
NA,connexion with the production of rifles at,30
NA,the Small Arms Factory. They,30
NA,out the difficulties which are there. They,30
NA,"point out the difficulties of material, the",30
NA,"difficulties of men, and the difficulties of",30
NA,housing. As regards the difficulties of,30
NA,"men, I venture to say that there is no",30
NA,trouble on that score. Surely,30
NA,"men have passed through the factory,",30
NA,and are working at other places in,30
NA,"Australia, to man a second shift under",30
NA,proper supervision. The men,30
NA,-and they are no mean judges in these,30
NA,matters-see no difficulty in working a,30
NA,"double shift, and would infinitely",30
NA,working two or three shifts to working,30
NA,the overtime which they are doing at pre-,30
NA,sent. You cannot convince me that with,30
NA,"such machinery as there is in the factory,",30
NA,competent engineers cannot operate it,30
NA,after having been shown the way to do,30
NA,ilfr. Joseph Cook.,30
NA,"it. A t the dockyard, i n Balmain, I am",30
NA,told that there are about ten men who,30
NA,have worked at the Small Arms Factory,30
NA,at one time or other. Surely they could,30
NA,be mobilised and put back there? I am,30
NA,glad that after ten months the Govern-,30
NA,ment are beginning to recognise their real,30
NA,"responsibility i n this matter, and now",30
NA,see that something should have been,30
NA,done long ago t o multiply the output of,30
NA,the factory. I know-an d I speak with,30
NA,every respect-tha t the Minister has been,30
NA,"taking the advice of his experts, b u t I",30
NA,venture to say-an d I do i t clothed with,30
NA,a sense of responsibility-tha t there are,30
NA,occasions when the Minister - must talk,30
NA,plainly even to his experts.,30
Mr KING OMALLEY ," H e a r , hear, and",30
NA,walk right over them.,30
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,"No , I do not",30
NA,French say that. M y point is that the experts,30
NA,and should not rule and dominate any De-,30
NA,"munitions, partment. They are the servants of the",30
NA,"Department, and the thing is fo r the",30
NA,"people, Minister to get them with him to carry",30
NA,out a reasonable policy as f a r as he,30
NA,can,30
Mr MCWILLIAMS , I am very glad i n -,30
NA,needlessly deed that you recognise that.,30
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I have never,30
NA,recognised anything else. The Minister,30
NA,Australia. ought to get all their ability placed,30
NA,loyally and cordially at his disposal i n,30
NA,"the carrying out of the high policy, which",30
NA,i t is the function and the sole respon-,30
NA,small Par- sibility of Ministers to introduce. That,30
NA,is where I cannot help feeling that some-,30
NA,"thing is lacking, and I hope that I",30
NA,will be acquitted of party feeling in this,30
NA,point matter. God knows I want to make no,30
NA,party capital out of this business. I f,30
NA,honorable members would not introduce,30
NA,"party interjections, I should be glad to",30
NA,steer clear of the lot of them. This is a,30
NA,matter high above and beyond all these,30
NA,enough things.,30
NA,"Mr KING O'MALLEY -Hear , hear!",30
NA,I t concerns the salvation of the Empire.,30
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wha t are the,30
NA,facts ? While we have been at luncheon,30
NA,to-day there has been handed round a f u r-,30
NA,prefer ther casualty list containing 311 names.,30
NA,For the last week we have been getting,30
NA,"a casualty list of 300 names a day, or at",30
NA,"the rate of 2,100 a week. That means",30
NA,"about 9,000 casualties a month. A d d to",30
NA,that number casualties through sickness,30
NA,"and other causes, and we have a wastage",30
NA,"at the rate of 10,000 a month.",30
Mr JENSEN ,Bu t remember that you,31
NA,have a lot of those slightly wounded going,31
NA,back to the front .,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Yes ; b u t those,31
NA,men will not be going back immediately.,31
NA,"M y point is that while 10,000 men a",31
NA,"month represent the wastage of war, the",31
NA,"Minister, i n his appeal this morning,",31
NA,"asked for only 5,300 men a month to re-",31
NA,"place them; 5,300 a month, he said, is",31
NA,what we want for reinforcements. I f the,31
NA,"wastage is going to be 10,000 a month,",31
NA,"and the replenishment 5,300, then, to use",31
NA,"an Irishism, "" I t will be no replenish-",31
NA,"ment."" I t means that, very soon, your",31
NA,army will not be very strong i f the pre-,31
NA,sent rate of slaughter continues.,31
Mr BURNS ,Wher e does the Minister,31
NA,get his instruction from ? Does he not,31
NA,get i t from the W a r Office?,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,No .,31
Mr BURNS ,"W e could send 200,000",31
NA,men.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e War Office,31
NA,to-morrow would take a quarter of a mil-,31
NA,lion men i f we could send them ready to,31
NA,fight. They need nothing so much as,31
NA,men to relieve the soldiers i n the trenches.,31
NA,They need men f o r nothing so much as,31
NA,to give those who have borne the brunt of,31
NA,the fighting a little relief.,31
Mr FENTON ,Bu t could we equip that,31
NA,number ?,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,No .,31
Mr FENTON , I f we have not got the,31
NA,"material, how could we do i t ?",31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e honorable,31
NA,member will have the honorable member,31
NA,for Maranoa turning upon h i m i f,31
NA,begins to make such interjections.,31
NA,"know the difficulty, and he knows i t , too.",31
Mr LAIRD SMITH , D o you not think,31
NA,"that Australia has done very well, and",31
NA,"the Australians, too?",31
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I think,31
NA,we have done very well; I think that we,31
NA,could have done better. I am,31
NA,I have to say that.,31
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,S o am I .,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I tell the hon-,31
NA,orable member that I have not been satis-,31
NA,fied.,31
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I am sorry to hear,31
NA,you say that.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Le t my honorabout,31
NA,able friends look at the millions i n the,31
NA,"field, and look relatively at our popuof",31
NA,"lation, and then decide the matter for",31
NA,themselves. I t is our war. The enemy,31
NA,want Australia and South Africa . They now,31
NA,[136]- 2,31
NA,"do not, i n my judgment, want to possess",31
NA,England. I doubt i f they would do i t,31
NA,to-morrow i f they could; but they do want,31
NA,"those two countries, and, therefore, i t is",31
NA,"our war. I am sorry to have to say i t ,",31
NA,"but there seems to me to be the notion,",31
NA,"even yet, that we are sending troops to",31
NA,the assistance of Great Britain to fight a,31
NA,battle in which the Homeland is peculiarly,31
NA,interested over and above our own i n -,31
NA,terests.,31
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Wh o suggested,31
NA,such a thing? No one!,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t is the,31
NA,thing we want to get out of our minds.,31
NA,Does the honorable member opposite think,31
NA,that an effective fighting force i n the,31
NA,"field, of, say, 40,000. is a sufficient num-",31
NA,ber to defend Australia when all her i n -,31
NA,"terests are at stake, and when there are",31
NA,millions on the other side ?,31
Mr FINLAYSON ,Bu t that is not the,31
NA,extent of our contribution.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wha t does the,31
NA,honorable member mean ?,31
Mr FINLAYSON , I mean that i n ad-,31
NA,dition to that we have a Navy there.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,"Yes , a Navy,",31
NA,"which, by-the-bye, is getting less, and",31
NA,again is not being replaced.,31
Mr FINLAYSON , I am with you there.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t is the,31
NA,point which I am on. I am showing that,31
NA,the wastage of war is at the rate of,31
NA,"10,000 a month, that all the reinforce-",31
NA,"ments the Minister is asking for is 5,300",31
NA,"a month, and that that does not increase",31
NA,your effectiveness in the field by one man.,31
NA,he I t makes up f o r about just half the,31
NA,I wastage of war. The honorable member,31
NA,can read the list himself. I f this kind of,31
NA,"thing continues, and the rate of casual-",31
NA,"ties is maintained, i t means that we shall",31
NA,have very little fighting force there un-,31
NA,that less we get a move on somewhere.,31
Mr JENSEN ,W e are continually,31
NA,sorry that sending reinforcements.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I know.,31
Mr JENSEN ,An d many of those who,31
NA,are wounded only slightly will be back i n,31
NA,the fighting line i n a week or two.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is to be,31
NA,hoped that they will. I believe that,31
NA,"50 per cent, of them go back to",31
NA,"the fighting line; but, even so, the appeal",31
NA,the Minister of Defence this morning,31
NA,was for the balance of the reinforcements,31
NA,"required, and there is no proposal, either",31
NA,"or in prospect, so f a r as his statement",31
NA,"this morning goes, for increasing the",32
NA,Jier of effectives in the field. That,32
NA,point I want to stress. I only want to,32
NA,get i t into the minds of honorable memuse,32
NA,bers so that they may come out and help,32
NA,us to remedy the thing. That is the,32
NA,"ject of my criticisms all through, and if of. these works.",32
NA,sometimes I seem to get warm in my ex-,32
NA,"pressions, i t is because I feel in earnest",32
NA,"about the situation, and am anxious to",32
NA,help. Concerning the Small Arms,32
NA,"Factory, here is-perhap s I had better not said that.",32
NA,"say i t , for, in my opinion, the reports",32
NA,from the two Parliamentary,32
NA,constitute a reflection on the Defence ad-,32
NA,ministration during the past nine months.,32
NA,There is no escape from it. Nine mouths look,32
NA,"after the war has broken out, two Com-",32
NA,"mittees of this Parliament, comprising",32
NA,"sixteen members chosen from both sides,",32
NA,"and acting quite separately, attacked this jecting.",32
NA,"problem from different points of view,",32
NA,and arrived at tbe same conclusion. A,32
NA,majority of the members of tbe Commember,32
NA,mittees represented the party on tho,32
NA,other side of the House.,32
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,D o you suggest,32
NA,that we would make a party question of,32
NA,the matter?,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,No ; and will,32
NA,the honorable member hold his tongue?,32
NA,I will not allow him to get party into,32
NA,it either.,32
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Wh y use language marks.,32
NA,like that ? . .,32
The CHAIRMAN ,Orde r ! Will the,32
NA,honorable member for Denison cease these,32
NA,interruptions ?,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I thought,32
NA,was trying to show the non-party setting.,32
NA,Two Committees composed of honorable,32
NA,members from both - parties have unanimy,32
NA,mously decided that there should be,32
NA,shifts to make rifles at Lithgow. II,32
NA,not be made a party matter because,32
NA,majority of honorable members on that,32
NA,side of the House who are not likely,32
NA,do anything to hurt their own GovernSince,32
NA,"ment, say that two shifts should have been",32
NA,"at work at Lithgow, and could be emthat",32
NA,ployed in a very short space of time.,32
Mr BOYD ,Th e honorable member for,32
NA,"Denison put his signature to the stateEmpire,",32
NA,ment.,32
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,"Hear , hear.",32
The CHAIRMAN ,Order !,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e two Com,32
NA,mittees say that the output of rifles,32
NA,be increased by 70 per cent.,32
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Wha t have the,32
NA,is the experts been doing al! this time?,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is of no,32
NA,blinking the fact that these reports do,32
NA,furnish a condemnation of the methods,32
NA,obof the Department in the administration,32
Mr GREGORY ,I t must not be for-,32
NA,gotten that the men themselves were,32
NA,anxious for a second shift to be put on.,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I have already,32
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Hav e you perused,32
NA,Committees the evidence we took?,32
The CHAIRMAN ,Order !,32
Mr LAIRD SMITH , I advise you to,32
NA,at the evidence.,32
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! I ask the,32
NA,honorable member to desist from inter-,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am not con-,32
NA,cerned with the evidence. The honorable,32
NA,has put down his own name to,32
NA,the statement that the Department can,32
NA,"get 70 per cent, more rifles out of the",32
NA,factory.,32
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Loo k at the evi-,32
NA,d&ncG.,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wha t is the,32
NA,use of the honorable member quibbling,32
NA,about the evidence ?,32
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Yo u should read,32
NA,the evidence before you make these re-,32
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,M y wish is,32
NA,to emphasize the fact that we are not,32
NA,"doing enough, having regard to the range",32
NA,"and scale of this war, in the way of equip-",32
NA,I ing men and manufacturing munitions.,32
NA,I hope that honorable members will con-,32
NA,stitute themselves recruiting agents. I n,32
NA,humble way I have been doing what I,32
NA,two can in that connexion. One newspaper i n,32
NA,canAustralia deserves special mention for the,32
NA,"the manner in which it has, throughout the",32
NA,"war, advocated the making of every effort",32
NA,to on the part of Australia to do its best.,32
NA,I proposed that Australia should,32
NA,"send 100,000 men to the front, it has kept",32
NA,object i n view. Such a number would,32
NA,be a very modest contribution for Aus-,32
NA,tralia to make towards the defence of the,32
NA,and the sooner we can fulfil that,32
NA,ideal the better i t will be for all con-,32
NA,"cerned. Now, with regard to matters",32
NA,arising out of the war. As to the mobil-,32
NA,"ization of our resources, honorable mem-",32
NA,could bers opposite are constantly complaining,32
NA,"that they have no power, and can do",32
NA,nothing. Let me tell memhers of the,33
NA,Committee what I think can be done.,33
NA,speak with great diffidence in the presence,33
NA,"of my late Attorney-General, whom I",33
NA,"have not consulted on this subject, and",33
NA,who may not agree with the views that I,33
NA,am about to express. I venture to say,33
NA,that we can do several things. I n the,33
NA,"first place, we have complete power to",33
NA,"control exportation, and that implies the",33
NA,power to trace everything that is exwar,33
NA,ported to its source. That is a tremenwho,33
NA,dous power.,33
Mr TUDOR , I do not think that we,33
NA,can do that until we have got the stuff,33
NA,into our stores.,33
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I think that would,33
NA,we can.,33
Mr TUDOR , I shall be pleased to learn,33
NA,that that is so.,33
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,The n the Goof,33
NA,"vernment has the power, which it has national",33
NA,"taken by legislation, to acquire anything",33
NA,it needs for defence purposes. I t may,33
NA,take munitions or materials of any kind,33
NA,requisite for the defence of the country.,33
NA,That givps the Government power to,33
NA,mandeer to any extent. The Government,33
NA,could also get created a Royal Commishood,33
NA,"sion, like the Beef Commission of",33
NA,"previous Administration, and give it",33
NA,"plete powers of investigation, comprising",33
NA,"an inquiry into every detail, the examinacircumstances.",33
NA,"tion of account hooks, and all other",33
NA,ments.,33
Mr MATHEWS ,Tha t would merely,33
NA,end with a report.,33
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t would beof,33
NA,best to get the report of a Commission,33
NA,before saying where we should stop. I lias,33
NA,complain that the Government will,33
NA,"use the powers that i t possesses. Honorbutts,",33
NA,able members opposite merely complain,33
NA,"make political capital. That ought ""not",33
NA,to be done. As to the recruiting,33
NA,I am not sure that the time has not come,33
NA,for the registration of all able-bodied men,33
NA,in Australia. I do not speak of their,33
NA,"mobilization; and, in referring to the",33
NA,"matter, I am speaking entirely on",33
NA,own responsibility. The flower of,33
NA,"manhood is going to the war, and",33
NA,men have gone who ought not to be,33
NA,"the place of others just as fit, who",33
NA,be better spared.,33
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e right honorover.,33
NA,nble member's time has expired.,33
Mr JOSEPH COOK ," I should, by",33
NA,"I leave, like five minutes more.",33
NA,Leave granted.,33
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Justic e alone,33
NA,will soon require that we should do some-,33
NA,"thing in the direction I suggest, instead of",33
NA,leaving people to please themselves as to,33
NA,whether they will enlist. I t appears to,33
NA,me to offend the very elements of justice,33
NA,to send the flower of our manhood to the,33
NA,and to allow to remain at home those,33
NA,cannot be got to realize their respon-,33
NA,sibilities.,33
Mr TUDOR ,Wha t does the right hon-,33
NA,orable member advise-conscription ?,33
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I think that i t,33
NA,be sufficient for the present i f we,33
NA,had a call of the muster-roll. Something,33
NA,of the kind is provided for in the Defence,33
NA,Act of 1901. That Act implies a power,33
NA,conscription for the protection of the,33
NA,"safety. On this subject, I",33
NA,".peak with great deference, and with as",33
NA,"little emphasis as I can, but I think that",33
NA,"the time will soon arrive, if things con-",33
NA,"tinue to go on as they are going, to make",33
NA,"a register, and call tlie muster roll, so",33
NA,comthat we may know what men are avail-,33
NA,"able, and may make sure that the man-",33
NA,of the country is doing its duty.,33
NA,"the We are not doing, and we cannot do,",33
NA,comwithout a complete cessation of party,33
NA,"warfare, all that is necessary under the",33
NA,We cannot properly,33
NA,documobilize our resources while the Labour,33
NA,party is carrying on an active Darty,33
NA,propaganda and warfare. We need to,33
NA,bring to bear at this juncture the whole,33
NA,"our resources, and to mobilize our",33
NA,munitions. The manager of the Small,33
NA,Arms Factory at Lithgow says that he,33
NA,not been turning out more rifles be-,33
NA,not cause he has been short of timber for,33
NA,and of metal for other portions.,33
NA,to Are we to be told that there would be,33
NA,any lack of material in Australia could,33
NA,"of men, it be mobilized?",33
Mr FENTON,Tha t is all right now.,33
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t would have,33
NA,been all right from the beginning if an,33
NA,my earnest effort had been made. We need,33
NA,our the mobilization of arms and men and,33
NA,many of resources. The Government must do,33
NA,taking something of the kind which i t has,33
NA,could already repudiated. I t must get some,33
NA,other body to help i t in the mobilization,33
NA,of our' resources. The war is not yet,33
NA,"Indeed, it is "" a long, long way to",33
NA,"! Tipperary."" We are fighting a foe that",33
NA,is not deficient in resources; a foe that,34
NA,made itself thoroughly ready before i t,34
NA,began hostilities; a foe that has mobilized,34
NA,"all its resources-scientific , military, and",34
NA,industrial-an d put them wholly on a,34
NA,war basis. We are warring against an,34
NA,enemy that has thrown to the winds all,34
NA,"moral considerations, and is murdering",34
NA,"and maiming innocent people, and making",34
NA,"the slaughter as f r i g h t f u l as possible, even",34
NA,poisoning with fumes of various kinds to,34
NA,gain its ends; an enemy that is ignoring,34
NA,"all the fair laws of fighting, and will",34
NA,resort to any tactics if onlv i t may win,34
NA,"thereby. Opposed to a foe like this,",34
NA,"which is constantly putting myriads, of",34
NA,"men into tlie field thoroughly equipped,",34
NA,we must do the same. We must put all,34
NA,our might and resources into the oppo-,34
NA,site scale. We must send into the fight-,34
NA,ing line every man and every gun tha i,34
NA,we possess for the protection of the,34
NA,"national safety, the security of those who",34
NA,"are near and dear to us, and the safety",34
NA,of the country that we love so well.,34
Mr MATHEWS ,Melbourne Ports),34
NA,[2.40] -Th e Leader of the Opposition,34
NA,has addressed himself exhaustively to this,34
NA,"matter, and I listened to his speech with",34
NA,"pleasure, although he charged the party",34
NA,to which I belong with carrying on a.,34
NA,party warfare while a great national con-,34
NA,flict is proceeding. He says that we are,34
NA,holding a conference in Adelaide for the,34
NA,purpose of a party propaganda which,34
NA,would be best left alone at the present,34
NA,juncture. B u t as the well-being of the,34
NA,"people depends upon party politics, we",34
NA,ought to have party politics every time.,34
NA,We cannot get away from the fact that,34
NA,any political party desirous of furthering,34
NA,the interests of the people is justified i n,34
NA,taking whatever steps i t thinks fit to do,34
NA,that. We know that in the Old Country,34
NA,there are industrial troubles. Does anybody,34
NA,here think for a moment that the men,34
NA,are looking for these industrial troubles?,34
NA,Rather is i t that they are being exploited,34
NA,"by great capitalistic concerns, that food",34
NA,"prices have gone up, and that they are",34
NA,demanding liigher wages so that they can,34
NA,keep themselves in a civilized condition;,34
NA,and they are justified in doing i t . The,34
NA,honorable member knows that as well as,34
NA,I do. Take that great milling concern,34
NA,"which has a capital of £800,000. Their",34
NA,profits last year amounted to no less than,34
NA,"£ 1100,000. They have been robbing",34
NA,somebody i n order to get that huge,34
NA,"amount; but, while they are crying out",34
NA,against the men for not manufacturing,34
NA,"munitions of war, we find that they are",34
NA,not paying any higher wages themselves,34
NA,during the time that they are making,34
NA,such huge profits as this. I t is the duty,34
NA,of the party on this side of the House to,34
NA,consider the situation arising out of the,34
NA,"stress of war, and to look after the inte-",34
NA,rests of those they represent. I f i t is,34
NA,"party politics to do that, then we will",34
NA,have to go i n for more party politics. I,34
NA,would like to deal shortly with the action,34
NA,"of the Government i n regard to foodstuffs,",34
NA,and i n this matter I may say that I am,34
NA,not here necessarily to defend the Govern-,34
NA,"ment. As honorable members know, a",34
NA,"Government can do much, but, as far as",34
NA,"foodstuffs is concerned, I am of the",34
NA,opinion that this Government cannot do,34
NA,more than they have done. The High,34
NA,Court has knocked out any legislation,34
NA,that we have passed that might have,34
NA,helped us in this direction. Their latest,34
NA,ruling decided against the Inter-State,34
NA,Commission on the question of the right,34
NA,of New South Wales to seize all the wheat,34
NA,grown i n that State; and i t is quite,34
NA,evident that this Parliament has not suffi-,34
NA,cient power. I f the Parliament itself has,34
NA,"not the power, I am quite certain that",34
NA,we cannot create any body and give i t the,34
NA,power.,34
Mr JOSEPH COOK , A l l the H i g h Court,34
NA,has ever done is to tell you that you,34
NA,cannot do all this in your own way.,34
Mr GROOM ,I n the New South Wales,34
NA,case the High Court held that the Go-,34
NA,vernment had power of acquisition. They,34
NA,did not say that the Commonwealth had,34
NA,no power.,34
Mr MATHEWS , I am tired of read-,34
NA,ing reports and of Commissions collect-,34
NA,ing evidence as to what the powers of,34
NA,"the Commonwealth are, only to discover",34
NA,that when we pass an A c t of Parliament,34
NA,dealing with a certain matter we have,34
NA,not the power to bring that Act into,34
NA,operation. I know the Government is,34
NA,not scathless. I f you selected the best,34
NA,men in this chamber and put them into,34
NA,"similar positions, we could find fault",34
NA,"with them; but I believe, as far as food-",34
NA,"stuffs are concerned, that this Govern-",34
NA,ment has done as much as i t possibly,34
NA,could have done with the power i t pos-,34
NA,sesses. The Government have supreme,34
NA,"power over exports, and when an attack",34
NA,was made upon the most important sec-,34
NA,"tion of our food supply, the Government",34
NA,took the duty off wheat. They stopped,35
NA,"the exportation of sugar-, and they",35
NA,"stopped the exportation of meat, except",35
NA,to the British Army. A n d I will show,35
NA,that in regard to sugar they have done,35
NA,a very great deal in the interests of the,35
NA,people outside.,35
Mr GROOM ,Wha t have they done?,35
Mr MATHEWS , I n regard to sugar,35
NA,"alone, we have here an example that can",35
NA,be presented to the world of how Protec-,35
NA,tion has given Australia sugar at a,35
NA,cheaper price than i t can be obtained,35
NA,anywhere else in the world. You cannot,35
NA,get away from that fact. Look at the,35
NA,price. I n Brisbane i t is £ 2 3 ; i n New,35
NA,"South Wales, £ 2 1 ; in Victoria,",35
NA,£21 2s. 6d. The right honorable the,35
NA,Leader of the Opposition states that the,35
NA,Government ought to have listened to,35
NA,"Mr Knox, and made an arrangement",35
NA,with him-th e honorable member for,35
NA,"Darwin, who is supposed to be a good",35
NA,"business man, slipped on the same ques-",35
NA,tion-bu t i f we had taken the duty o f f .,35
NA,"sugar, or i f we took the duty off sugar to-",35
NA,"morrow and imported sugar, i t would be",35
NA,impossible to sell i t in Australia at less,35
NA,than £25 per ton; and every honorable,35
NA,member knows i t . Why not be candid and,35
NA,"just i n regard to this matter, and let the",35
NA,public know the real situation ? I n Eng-,35
NA,land the price of sugar is £27 6s. per ton,35
NA,wholesale.,35
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t is the,35
NA,fixed by the Asquith Government.,35
Mr MATHEWS , I am quite aware,35
NA,that i t is. Tbe British Government have,35
NA,"powers that this Government have not, and '",35
NA,"when the war started, being common-",35
NA,"sense men, and knowing that they could",35
NA,"not get sugar from Europe, they im-",35
NA,mediately ordered sugar from Jamaica.,35
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,An d put the price,35
NA,up.,35
Mr MATHEWS , W e know that their,35
NA,action i n going to a market outside im-,35
NA,mediately raised the price of sugar; and,35
NA,if we were to go into the market the result,35
NA,would be that the price here would be still,35
NA,"further raised, that is, i f we wanted a",35
NA,"large quantity. But, fortunately, we do",35
NA,not want very much. B u t why not admit,35
NA,"the fact at once, that i f the Government",35
NA,had taken the dutv off sugar i t would,35
NA,have increased the price to the people of,35
NA,Australia to £ 2 5 per ton. The honorable,35
NA,member for Moreton thinks only of the,35
NA,"grower. As a Protectionist, I say the",35
NA,sugar-grower has a lot to growl about i n,35
NA,"regard to the price of sugar, for there is",35
NA,"no doubt, i n my opinion, that the Aus-",35
NA,tralian sugar-grower has not received that,35
NA,benefit from Protection that he ought to,35
NA,have received in the ordinary course of,35
NA,"things. I will admit that at once, but",35
NA,"on the general question, so far as sugar",35
NA,"is concerned, this Government is entitled",35
NA,to universal praise.,35
Mr GROOM ,Wha t does the retailer,35
NA,pay per ton ?,35
Mr MATHEWS , I cannot go into,35
NA,"the retail price. A l l I know is, that i f",35
NA,the wholesale price is £ 2 1 2s. 6d -an d,35
NA,there is a fixed retail price-whe n the,35
NA,wholesale price goes up to £ 2 5 the fixed,35
NA,retail price will go up sympathetically.,35
NA,I do not wish to charge the right honor-,35
NA,able gentleman with having made a partv,35
NA,"speech this afternoon. To my mind, he",35
NA,spoke in a manner that I would like,35
NA,to see adopted more frequently in,35
NA,speeches delivered i n this House.,35
NA,I accept the statement of the right hon-,35
NA,orable gentleman that he was not talking,35
NA,"party politics, bub, at the same time, he",35
NA,did attack the Government for not having,35
NA,done something. To my mind the Go-,35
NA,vernment have done all they could. They,35
NA,do not possess the power to do more.,35
Mr RILEY , I f they had done more,35
NA,they would still have been criticised.,35
Mr MATHEWS , I f they had done,35
NA,"price something they ought not to have done,",35
NA,they ought to be criticised. The right,35
NA,"honorable gentleman also said that, in-",35
NA,"stead of considering details as to pyjamas,",35
NA,"and such like, i t would be better for us",35
NA,to take into consideration the matter of,35
NA,"keeping-100,000 men f u l l y equipped at",35
NA,the front by supplying drafts to fill up,35
NA,"the wastage of war. To my mind, i t is",35
NA,"this matter of "" details "" that is retard-",35
NA,ing enlistment. I do not go the whole,35
NA,way with the honorable member for,35
NA,"Bourke, but incidents such as those with",35
NA,"which the honorable member has dealt,",35
NA,and which we cannot get elucidated by,35
NA,"the Defence Department, occasion all the",35
NA,"pinpricks and dissatisfaction. Take, f or",35
NA,"instance, the horrible letters read to-day",35
NA,"by the Assistant Minister of Defence, con-",35
NA,taining charges against officers at Rabaul.,35
NA,The reading of those letters turns me,35
NA,sick. I f the charges contained in,35
NA,"them . were true the, men accused",35
NA,"must be sexual perverts, fit for lunatic",35
NA,"asylums, and not prisons. We need not-",35
NA,be squeamish in regard to matters of this,36
NA,sort. We know that men associating with,36
NA,others would never go to the distance,36
NA,these men are charged with having gone,36
NA,unless they were mad. That is the stand-,36
NA,point from which the matter should have,36
NA,been considered. I do not believe these,36
NA,charges. They are too horrible to believe.,36
NA,1 have heard the evidence on which the,36
NA,men who have made these charges were,36
NA,convicted and sentenced to four or five,36
NA,years' imprisonment. I believe that they,36
NA,should have been sentenced to twenty,36
NA,"years' imprisonment, and that they",36
NA,"should not have been released, considering",36
NA,that they carried out highway robbery of,36
NA,the heinousness described in the evidence.,36
NA,Every one knows the difference between,36
NA,highway robbery and looting. I do not,36
NA,"defend looting, but one can understand",36
NA,that what is known as looting may be,36
NA,picking up something belonging to some,36
NA,one else-a n action which is in no degree,36
NA,a crime compared with the action of men,36
NA,"who, at the point of the bayonet on a",36
NA,"loaded rifle, would rob a Chinaman of",36
NA,£200. That was not looting. I do not,36
NA,believe the charges laid by these men as,36
NA,indicated in the letters read to-day. How-,36
NA,"ever, I am not talking of this case par-",36
NA,"ticularly. Unfortunately, more Defence",36
NA,"Department complaints, even - before the",36
NA,"war, have come under my purview than",36
NA,"that of any other honorable member, be-",36
NA,"cause, owing to the fact that the barracks",36
NA,and the naval branch are situated in my,36
NA,"electorate, the men come to me as their",36
NA,representative. I have been able to get,36
NA,little redress for them. The officers in,36
NA,Department keep back the investigation,36
NA,of everything. That is a detail which has,36
NA,created in the minds of certain people,36
NA,the opinion that there is something un-,36
NA,touchable in the Defence Department that,36
NA,ought to be inquired into.,36
Mr GREGORY ,Coul d not you have got,36
NA,this matter remedied by your party in-,36
NA,stead of bringing i t forward in tbe,36
NA,House?,36
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e honorable,36
NA,member knows that we are only a party,36
NA,where our platform is concerned. I t is,36
NA,generally understood that outside tEe,36
NA,party platform the Ministry has as much,36
NA,"power as any other Ministry can have,",36
NA,"and' its actions, therefore, in those mat-",36
NA,ters do not come within the purview of,36
NA,"the party. Therefore, honorable mem-",36
NA,bers must take every opportunity to,36
NA,get matters redressed. I charge the,36
NA,Department with permitting an un-,36
NA,fair method of recruiting. Men are,36
NA,"accepted who are not healthy-a t least, if",36
NA,"they are healthy, other men who have",36
NA,been rejected should have been accepted.,36
NA,In other Departments there is always,36
NA,some spot on which one can lay his finger,36
NA,so that any trouble may be elucidated;,36
NA,but what is the matter with the Defence,36
NA,Department that we cannot do the same ?,36
NA,As for the horrors we have heard to-day,36
NA,from the Assistant Minister-whic h were,36
NA,so terrible as to make me sick-i t will go,36
NA,"forth to the world, if the matter is not",36
NA,"censored, that Australians have been",36
NA,guilty of crimes we have been hurling,36
NA,anathemas at) the Germans for perpetrat-,36
NA,ing. The fault lies with the Defence De-,36
NA,"partment, though I cannot put my finger",36
NA,on the spot. The Department must take,36
NA,the blame for the fact that these matters,36
NA,cannot be elucidated and people cannot,36
NA,get the opportunity of seeing that they are,36
NA,set right.,36
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Yo u are attacking,36
NA,the Government.,36
Mr MATHEWS , I am not attacking,36
NA,bhe Government from the stand-point of,36
NA,my party. I t is the duty of the Minister,36
NA,of Defence to see that we do not have,36
NA,such things as these horrors brought for-,36
NA,"ward in the House, and he can prevent it",36
NA,by giving to the men the opportunity to,36
NA,have such troubles squared up. Had that,36
NA,beeu done in this case these things would,36
NA,not have been heard of to-day. But the,36
NA,the Defence Department will not give this op-,36
NA,portunity. I f a mistake is made i t is,36
NA,hidden; i t is never admitted; one can,36
NA,never get down upon .it because the De-,36
NA,partment has methods of covering up all,36
NA,these things. The Prime Minister has,36
NA,"promised to do certain things, and I hope",36
NA,that in future the Defence Department,36
NA,will see that when matters of this sort,36
NA,are brought forward the people can get,36
NA,explanations with regard to them. And,36
NA,"I hope, further, that the Department will",36
NA,"not hide anything, and that we shall not",36
NA,have a repetition of what has occurred,36
NA,here to-day at the outset of our career,36
NA,as a military nation. Whether the pre-,36
NA,"sent war, in which i t was necessary for",36
NA,"us to participate, will put a stop to mili-",36
NA,tarism I do not know. I think that it,36
NA,should go a long way towards doing so.,36
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Tha t remark has,36
NA,been made after every war.,36
Mr MATHEWS ,Ther e has never,37
NA,been such a war as the present. This is,37
NA,"a war of nations, and not a war of armies.",37
NA,We are told that there is a system where-,37
NA,by the food question could be handled.,37
NA,We are told that under the stress of war,37
NA,the Government can take over every com-,37
NA,modity. Every time that has been said,37
NA,the honorable member for Darwin has,37
NA,"said, ""Hear, hear""; but unless he has",37
NA,gone back on what he always preached in,37
NA,"the past, the honorable member would be",37
NA,the last to accept such a method.,37
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -B y reducing,37
NA,"the duties, if your party were prepared",37
NA,"do i t , the cost of the necessaries of life a dead, inanimate thing.",37
NA,could be reduced.,37
Mr MATHEWS , The honorable finished,37
NA,"member has blown himself out at once,",37
NA,because i f we take off the duty on sugar,37
NA,up goes the cost of the article.,37
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -I f your arguto,37
NA,"ment is correct, the sooner we quadruple",37
NA,the duty on sugar the cheaper i t will be.,37
Mr MATHEWS ,Ther e is only one,37
NA,method by wliich the Government can,37
NA,take control of commodities and rule,37
NA,prices. We cannot do i t under our,37
NA,"stitution; but there is a method, and",37
NA,is by declaring martial law. The GoI,37
NA,"vernment could then say, "" I n the stress",37
NA,of war we propose to commandeer all,37
NA,"commodities on behalf of the people.""",37
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ,I s that martial,37
NA,law?,37
Mr MATHEWS ,Le t me explain diction,37
NA,what I mean. I do not think we have no,37
NA,the constitutional power to regulate,37
NA,price of foodstuffs or to take over comtial,37
NA,modities and sell them to the,37
NA,Federal Government can buy what they,37
NA,"need for their Army and their servants,",37
NA,but I do not think they can buy to sell,37
NA,to the public.,37
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Th e Government,37
NA,are going to do that in the Northern,37
NA,Territory.,37
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e honorable one,37
NA,member overlooks the fact that the,37
NA,Northern Territory belongs to the Coman,37
NA,monwealth. I t is one of our own Territhe,37
NA,"tories, and we have full power there",37
NA,do what we like in this regard.,37
NA,my time I have lived under a state of,37
NA,"semi-martial law, where the military",37
NA,were the all-pervading power. One had tion.,37
NA,to obtain from them a pass to proceed,37
NA,"from one street to another, and, in short,",37
NA,everything was under the control of the,37
NA,military.,37
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ,No t one of us,37
NA,wishes to live under military law.,37
Mr MATHEWS ,No . Martial law,37
NA,will never be declared by any vote of,37
NA,"mine, and I do not think that the honor-",37
NA,"able member for Darwin, who interjected",37
NA,"""Hear, hear!"" when i t was suggested",37
NA,that martial law should be availed of for,37
NA,"this purpose, would vote for such a thing.",37
NA,I am reminded of JEsop's fable of the,37
NA,"frogs who yearned for a king, and who,",37
NA,when given a log of wood to act in that,37
NA,"to capacity, cried out at once that this was",37
NA,They were,37
NA,"then given a stork, and King Stork",37
NA,up by eating the lot of them.,37
NA,And so it would be with martial law.,37
NA,Notwithstanding that the civil law is,37
NA,"dominant here, it seems almost impossible",37
NA,keep the military or defence system,37
NA,within bounds. Once the military had,37
NA,"control, everything relating to war and",37
NA,"defence matters would be glossed over,",37
NA,and they would do whatever they pleased.,37
NA,I hope that when the war is over the,37
NA,ConGovernment will do what they can to,37
NA,that bring about an improved condition; but,37
NA,sincerely trust that martial law will,37
NA,never be proclaimed for this purpose.,37
NA,"The consumers of Australia, who are de-",37
NA,manding consideration in the matter of,37
NA,"foodstuffs, would squeal most loudly of",37
NA,all i f they were placed under the juris-,37
NA,"of martial law, because there is",37
NA,"feeling, no justice-nothin g but a hide-",37
NA,the bound procedure-associate d with mar-,37
NA,"law, and i t could not prove beneficial",37
NA,public. The to a free people.,37
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ,Flinders),37
NA,1.3.3] -Wit h regard to the concluding,37
NA,utterances of the honorable member who,37
NA,"has just resumed his seat, I , for one, desire",37
NA,to express as strongly as I can the hope,37
NA,that we in Australia may never be placed,37
NA,under martial law. Before dealing with,37
NA,or two matters that have been raised,37
NA,"in this debate, I should like to refer to",37
NA,interjection made while the Leader of,37
NA,Opposition was speaking by the hon-,37
NA,"to orable member for Maranoa, who, I re-",37
NA,"During gret, is temporarily absent.",37
Mr FENTON ,"H e has withdrawn, and",37
NA,apologized to the Leader of the Opposi-,37
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ,N o one,37
NA,was more confident than I was that the,37
NA,honorable member would take that course,38
NA,as soon as he had had time for,38
NA,But it is not to that matter that I desire,38
NA,to allude. I attach the greatest importflag.,38
NA,ance to another interjection which the,38
NA,"honorable member for Maranoa made, beother",38
NA,-cause we all know that there is no honor-,38
NA,able member in whose breast there burns,38
NA,a higher glow of patriotism than in,38
NA,of the honorable member himself. When,38
NA,the Leader of the Opposition was saying power,38
NA,"that i f our enemies won this war, we",38
NA,"should be likely to lose Australia, the",38
NA,honorahle member interjected to the,38
NA,-effect that such a thing was beyond all,38
NA,"reasonable possibility. I desire, in the Australia will at once",38
NA,"clearest and most definite way, to express",38
NA,"my opinion upon this subject, because I",38
NA,feel sure that the great bulk of the people,38
NA,"of Australia, notwithstanding the deaths",38
NA,and the disaster that have come to tion,38
NA,a thousand homes in the Commonwealth;,38
NA,do not yet realize the issue about which,38
NA,we are fighting. Let me put it now as,38
NA,clearly as I possibly can. I f the result,38
NA,of this war were something like a drawn jection,38
NA,game; i f Germany were able to retain,38
NA,possession of those lands of which she is,38
NA,now in military occupation; i f we were,38
NA,not to weaken permanently her domina-,38
NA,tion in Europe; and i f she were in pos-,38
NA,session of that part of Belgium which,38
NA,"she now occupies, is there a man in",38
NA,House who does not know in his heart,38
NA,"that, in a very short time, the rest of",38
NA,coast-line between the Kiel Canal and the,38
NA,most southern part of the land she is now,38
NA,occupying would be German?,38
Mr MATHEWS ,Hollan d would have,38
NA,to go.,38
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ,Ever y one,38
NA,knows that the claims of Holland would,38
NA,"be scattered to the winds, and no one",38
NA,knows that better than do the Dutch.,38
NA,But I am taking the more favorable case,38
NA,"-th e case of a drawn game, or drawn",38
NA,"battle, between these great contesting their sons who have fallen.",38
NA,"Powers. I f we had, then, a nation braced",38
NA,"un to the highest military power,",38
NA,"though broken down, it may be,",38
NA,"moment, in its immediate attacking",38
NA,"power, occupying that coast-line in",38
NA,"North Sea, coupled with a coast-line",38
NA,"the Mediterranean, with a population",38
NA,"120,000,000, the most active, in some",38
NA,"spects the most intelligent, and certainly",38
NA,"by far the most highly-organized, in",38
NA,"world, how long do honorable members",38
NA,. think the British Flag would be domi-,38
NA,reflection. nant on the high seas?,38
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -O r any other,38
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE ,O r any,38
NA,flag. I t would be merely a question,38
NA,"of one, two, or three years before we",38
NA,that passed under German domination. But,38
NA,"if, on the other hand, Germany wins this",38
NA,"war; i f she humiliates France, breaks the",38
NA,"of Britain, or actually gets con-",38
NA,"trol over, or weakens, relatively speaking,",38
NA,to a great extent the power of the British,38
NA,"Navy, then as sure as the sun will rise",38
NA,"to-morrow, British",38
NA,South Africa and,38
NA,become German,38
NA,"possessions. Every man knows that, not",38
NA,"only here, but in Germany, where they",38
NA,have not scrupled to make such a declara-,38
NA,in almost express terms. What I,38
NA,wish to bring before honorable members,38
NA,with all the force that I can command is,38
NA,that the bulk of the people of Australia,38
NA,have not realized this fact. I t was with,38
NA,amazement that I heard such an inter-,38
NA,as that to which I have referred,38
NA,"emanate from such a s'ource, because",38
NA,there is no man here who would be more,38
NA,earnest and more strenuous in the desire,38
NA,to bring this fact before the whole of the,38
NA,people of Australia than the honorable,38
NA,this member for Maranoa would be i f he,38
NA,realized it. Last Saturday I was passing,38
NA,"the a sports ground not far from here, when",38
NA,"of my ears were suddenly greeted, as those",38
NA,"other honorable members have been,",38
NA,with a roar from the football field such,38
NA,as we sometimes hear. I am not here to,38
NA,say that people should not play football,38
NA,"at a time like this, or that others should",38
NA,not go to see them do so- I think they,38
NA,"should. But, after all, there was some-",38
NA,thing in that roar from thousands of,38
NA,young throats that jarred upon me when,38
NA,I thought of the hundreds of homes in,38
NA,Australia where mothers are weeping for,38
NA,The,38
NA,Leader of the Opposition has inti-,38
NA,almated that the time may soon come,38
NA,for the when we may have to think of,38
NA,registering all who can bear arms.,38
NA,the 1 desire to go a little further.,38
NA,in No honorable member will accuse,38
NA,"of me of making this a party question,",38
NA,"rebecause, in whatever steps the Govern-",38
NA,"ment may take, and to whatever length",38
NA,"the they may go, I shall support them. And",38
NA,I venture to say that i f the Government,38
NA,go i n the direction which the Leader of,39
NA,"the Opposition has indicated, the right",39
NA,honorable gentleman can promise them,39
NA,the support of members on this side of the,39
NA,House.,39
NA,"OPPOSITION MEMBERS --Hear ,",39
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , T h a t is a,39
NA,"step, the responsibility of which no party",39
NA,"can, by itself, very easily take; i t is a",39
NA,"measure which, i n any country, ought",39
NA,only to be adopted under the strain of,39
NA,extreme national danger. But I do sug-,39
NA,gest that there should be compulsory en-,39
NA,rolment of all men who are within the,39
NA,ages at which they are capable of serving,39
NA,"their country. Of course, many men will",39
NA,be exempt from such service by physical,39
NA,"reasons, and no doubt there would be",39
NA,"defined reasons for excluding many others,",39
NA,such as the fact that they have dependent,39
NA,upon them persons who cannot do without,39
NA,their support; but all other men i n the,39
NA,"community, single and married, should be",39
NA,"on this register, and then we should not",39
NA,have to depend solely upon those who,39
NA,come forward voluntarily for this service -,39
NA,I put this view to honorable members:,39
NA,"Those who have gone to the front, and",39
NA,"who are fighting for us, for Australia,",39
NA,"are drawn from all classes, all ranks, and",39
NA,all occupations i n this country. There is,39
NA,no discrimination. No one can say that,39
NA,"any particular occupation, or class, or set",39
NA,of people has not contributed its fair,39
NA,"share, but i t is undeniably a fact that",39
NA,from every section of the community i t,39
NA,"is the courageous, the active, and the",39
NA,good men who are going to the front -,39
NA,the men to whom above all others we,39
NA,look to carry on the affairs of the coun-,39
NA,"try and make Australia, i n the future,",39
NA,what i t has been in the past. Under the,39
NA,present system there is no doubt that,39
NA,men from all classes of the community-,39
NA,"the men of heart, intellect, and courage-",39
NA,"are going away, and i f that process is to",39
NA,continue for a long time-an d he is a,39
NA,sanguine man who would to-day fix a,39
NA,l i m i t to the war-wha t will be the posi-,39
NA,tion of Australia? A r e we to continue,39
NA,to be bled of our best? The national,39
NA,problem presents itself-an d i t is not for,39
NA,"one party, or one man, to answer-wha t",39
NA,are we going to do about it? I will say,39
NA,no more at this stage than that should,39
NA,honorable members on the Ministerial,39
NA,side come to the conclusion that any mea-,39
NA,sure of the k i n d ' I have indicated has be-,39
NA,"come necessary, I feel sure they will be",39
NA,able to count on the support of the,39
NA,"majority, i f not of all, the members of",39
NA,the Opposition. I wish now to deal i n a,39
NA,very few words with a totally different,39
NA,subject. I n connexion with a debate on,39
NA,"the food supplies, some constitutional",39
NA,"hear! questions were raised, and my learned",39
NA,leader was asked whether I agreed with,39
NA,certain views he was putting forward.,39
Mr JOSEPH COOK ," "" Learned leader """,39
NA,is good.,39
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , S o the hon-,39
NA,orable member is my learned leader. I,39
NA,involuntarily fell into that expression,39
NA,"after hearing his argument, but I may",39
NA,"add that, even i f I did not agree with",39
NA,"him, I should not have the courage to",39
NA,say so. We have been asked what the,39
NA,Liberal Government were prepared to do,39
NA,under the circumstances. I wish to re-,39
NA,mind honorable members that war was de-,39
NA,"clared on the 4th August, and that the",39
NA,general elections were to be held on the,39
NA,"5th September, so that the then Ministers",39
NA,were merely seat-warmers for the balance,39
NA,of their period of oflice; and the actual,39
NA,"questions that have now become acute,",39
NA,although they were certainly fore-,39
NA,"shadowed, and although we foresaw that",39
NA,"they would have to be dealt with, had",39
NA,not arrived at the position of requiring,39
NA,us to immediately deal with them. Never-,39
NA,"theless, foreseeing that some action by",39
NA,the Government in the direction of seizing,39
NA,"foodstuffs, and other necessaries, might",39
NA,"become imperative, the Board to which the",39
NA,Leader of the Opposition has referred,39
NA,was appointed. That Board was asked,39
NA,to do the work which the first paragraph,39
NA,of tbe motion proposed by the honorable,39
NA,"member for Cook last night aimed at, and",39
NA,"the Board was, i n fact, proceeding with",39
NA,that work. What would the Liberal Go-,39
NA,vernment have done i n the circumstances,39
NA,that exist to-day ? I am not going to,39
NA,attempt to define the constitutional powers,39
NA,of a Government such as ours i n time,39
NA,of war. I agree with the statement of,39
NA,the Attorney-General a few days ago,39
NA,that he would be a bold man who would,39
NA,place a limit to the powers of the Aus-,39
NA,tralian Government i n time of war. I,39
NA,did not agree with his application of that,39
NA,"view, because that application to the",39
NA,enemy contracts was about the most ex-,39
NA,"treme possible, the problem i n that case",39
NA,being whether we could pu t an end to,39
NA,"contracts which were, i n any circum-",39
NA,"stances, suspended during the currency",39
NA,of the war; thus tbe powers sought i n,39
NA,this legislation could only apply after the,39
NA,war. But with regard to the honorable,40
NA,gentleman's contention that i t is impos-,40
NA,"sible for a lawyer, or anybody else, to",40
NA,define the limits of the Government's,40
NA,"powers, I would point out to honorable",40
NA,members that the overriding principles,40
NA,recognised i n all countries is that all con-,40
NA,stitutional limitations give way to what,40
NA,"is the supreme law of the land, the safety",40
NA,of the realm. Nothing stands i n the way,40
NA,of that supreme law; i f that safety is,40
NA,really involved all constitutional ties are,40
NA,like flax i n a fire. I f this country were,40
NA,in immediate danger of occupation by the,40
NA,"enemy, is there any power that the",40
NA,National Government would not exercise,40
NA,to prevent such an occurrence? I ven-,40
NA,ture to say there is not. B u t we have,40
NA,not arrived at that dangerous stage yet.,40
NA,I do not propose to press my argument,40
NA,"any further than i t will go, but that",40
NA,"principle, salus populi suprema est lux,",40
NA,implies also that the supreme law must,40
NA,rest with the one Government that re-,40
NA,presents the whole of the people. How,40
NA,far that power would go is a different,40
NA,"question, the resolving of which must de-",40
NA,pend on the circumstances of the case.,40
NA,B u t in considering how far i t could be,40
NA,"applied, honorable members must not for-",40
NA,"get that warfare now, more than ever be-",40
NA,"fore, is an operation i n which, not merely",40
NA,those engaged with the weapons of on-,40
NA,"slaught i n their hands are taking part,",40
NA,but also those who are providing the,40
NA,"actual fighters with munitions, equipment,",40
NA,"and food; and i t is hard to. say, in the",40
NA,complex industrial and commercial con-,40
NA,"ditions now prevailing, exactly where war-",40
NA,like operations terminate. I am not pre-,40
NA,"pared to say that, under the existing",40
NA,"conditions i n Australia, any power would",40
NA,reside in the Federal Government to go,40
NA,about buying foodstuffs generally and dis-,40
NA,tributing them.,40
NA,NA,40
NA,point.,40
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , I have altions,40
NA,ready said that I shall not t r y to carry,40
NA,my argument further than I think,40
NA,go under the present conditions of Aus-,40
NA,"tralia, although that power might vest i n",40
NA,the Government under conditions of more,40
NA,immediate stress. B u t if the stress is,40
NA,"produced, i f the high prices are caused by",40
NA,people taking advantage of our necessiFor,40
NA,ties as a nation to corner and store large,40
NA,"quantities of foodstuffs, with a view",40
NA,"enhancing their price, and i f those people",40
NA,form rings and conspiracies i n order,40
NA,"do that, they are performing an operation",40
NA,which not only interferes with the life-,40
NA,"of the ordinary citizen, who is not even",40
NA,"indirectly connected with the war, more-",40
NA,than all citizens are; but they are inter-,40
NA,fering directly with the carrying put of,40
NA,"our preparations for war, with the pro-",40
NA,vision of food and equipment for o u r,40
NA,"men at the camp, with the provision f o r",40
NA,thoss engaged i n manufacturing muni-,40
NA,"tions of war, and practically with the-",40
NA,wages due to the men who make our,40
NA,munitions. Those are part of the opera-,40
NA,"tions of warfare, and i f there is an",40
NA,operation being carried out by people for,40
NA,"their own benefit, a conspiracy amongst",40
NA,"a number of people, or actions by any",40
NA,"single person, the immediate effect o f",40
NA,which is to impose upon the Government,40
NA,greater burdens and make i t more diffi-,40
NA,cult to find the supplies necessary for,40
NA,these or other operations immediately,40
NA,connected with the war- a result which,40
NA,would follow from any of the alleged cor-,40
NA,ners or combinations which are now sup-,40
NA,posed to exist-the n I say without hesi-,40
NA,"tation, i f they do exist, the Government",40
NA,"could, without any further constitutional",40
NA,"powers than we now possess, take steps to",40
NA,"put an end to them, and to punish the",40
NA,people so engaged i n a conspiracy against,40
NA,the safety of the realm.,40
Mr MATHEWS , I f you wiped out the,40
NA,civil law first.,40
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , F a r from,40
NA,that; but I will deal with that point,40
NA,later. I f there are any people now,40
NA,engaged i n garnering together foodstuffs,40
NA,"and other things which are necessaries,",40
NA,"directly or indirectly, to the community,",40
NA,"the Commonwealth, i n taking the steps",40
NA,necessary for its ultimate safety-an d,40
NA,that covers a very wide ground,40
Mr THOMAS ,Woul d you let the High,40
NA,"Court, or Parliament, or the Government",40
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , I n ques-,40
NA,of national safety no Court will go,40
NA,very far i n attempting to l i m i t the func-,40
NA,i t will tions of this Parliament.,40
Mr MATHEWS ,Th e parties concerned,40
NA,might resort to the protection of the civil,40
NA,law.,40
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , T h e y might.,40
NA,"my part, I should risk i t . I f the",40
NA,"object is simply to say, ' ' Things are",40
NA,"to dearer now than usual, whether through",40
NA,combinations or conspiracies or arrange-,40
NA,"to ments of the kind, therefore let us buy",40
NA,-the stuff and sell i t to the people more,41
NA,"-cheaply,"" I hardly think that would or",41
NA,"-could reasonably, i u the present condi-",41
NA,"tions of Australia, be regarded as a",41
NA,legitimate exercise of the constitutional,41
NA,power.,41
Mr FENTON ,Tha t is the point.,41
NA,Sir WILLIAM IRVINEHonorabl e,41
NA,.members can have my opinion for what,41
NA,"i t is worth, but I can hardly conceive",41
NA,-of a case i n which any considerable quan-,41
NA,tities of the foodstuffs of the people are,41
NA,"now cornered, where you could not go",41
NA,"further and say, "" Such cornering inter-",41
NA,"feres with all the operations, industrial",41
NA,"-as well as military, necessary to the de-",41
NA,"fence of this country."" The honorable",41
NA,member for Melbourne Ports talks about,41
NA,martial law. There is a little misappre-,41
NA,hension on that subject. Martial law is,41
NA,a kind of thing which is only -justifiable',41
NA,"where civil law has become impossible,",41
NA,and has nothing whatever to do with any,41
NA,rsteps which a Government may find i t,41
NA,necessary to take of the kind I have been,41
NA,describing. Martial law comes i n where,41
NA,"the Government, by its own unlawful",41
NA,"action, trusting to the subsequent autho-",41
NA,"r i t y of Parliament, or even perhaps i n -",41
NA,vested by Parliament f or the time being,41
NA,"with the power, takes away the civil",41
NA,rights of every citizen and places him,41
NA,under the jurisdiction of military officers.,41
NA,But that has nothing to do with the,41
NA,matter I was discussing.,41
Mr MATHEWS ,Withou t martial law,41
NA,a man can resort to the law courts; under,41
NA,martial law he cannot.,41
Sir WILLIAM IRVINE , W h e n 1,41
NA,"say that the State, i n the case of this",41
NA,"great necessity, can exercise these extra-",41
NA,"ordinary powers, I mean that where tbe",41
NA,necessity exists the State is not exceed-,41
NA,ing the law. I t is merely carrying out,41
NA,the law which the Courts have over and,41
NA,over again recognised as being the law,41
NA,of laws-th e law that overrides all other,41
NA,laws. The mode of carrying i t put is,41
NA,-always at the discretion of the Govern-,41
NA,ment. I have been dealing merely with,41
NA,the powers themselves. I do not want i t,41
NA,"to be assumed that, i n advocating these",41
NA,".steps, I am in favour of any application of",41
NA,martial law. I am not referring to the,41
NA,"actual disciplining of soldiers, but speak-",41
NA,"ing of the general civil population, and",41
NA,I say unhesitatingly that no circum-,41
NA,stances exist that would justify any ap-,41
NA,plication of martial law to Australia at,41
NA,the present time. I ventured to inter-,41
NA,vene i n the debate because I thought the,41
NA,Committee was entitled to my opinion.,41
NA,We ought all to be perfectly candid when,41
NA,"we are entering this crisis, and as to the",41
NA,more serious suggestion thrown out by the,41
NA,"right honorable member for Parramatta,",41
NA,"which receives my entire accord, i t is",41
NA,a matter which ought to be taken into,41
NA,"the immediate and serious consideration,",41
NA,"not only of the Government, but of hon-",41
NA,orable members on both sides of the,41
NA,House.,41
Mr ANSTEY ,Bourke) [3.27] -Th e,41
NA,honorable member for Flinders has raised,41
NA,the debate to a higher plane than I,41
NA,"reached i n my remarks, and I 'propose,",41
NA,"if I can, to follow his example. B u t i f",41
NA,any reliance can be placed on what he,41
NA,"has said, his speech was the strongest-",41
NA,justification possible of the attitude that,41
NA,I have taken up during the last six,41
NA,"months, both inside and outside the",41
NA,House. No man can indorse the honor-,41
NA,able member's utterances without admit-,41
NA,ting that I have been absolutely right,41
NA,in my attitude.,41
Mr CHARLTON ,Bu t do not forget that,41
NA,"the honorable member for Flinders said,",41
NA,""" The time has not arrived y e t . """,41
Mr ANSTEY ," I admit i t , and I",41
NA,admit also that that statement was re-,41
NA,"ceived with smiles of glee, although i t",41
NA,should not be a matter of joy to any-,41
NA,body on this side.,41
Mr MAHONY ,Th e honorable member,41
NA,was not playing to the gallery.,41
Mr ANSTEY , That is quite true.,41
NA,"I t was said yesterday, and i t has been",41
NA,"repeated to-day, that I am playing to",41
NA,"the gallery. Let i t be remembered,",41
NA,"therefore, that I am appealing to the",41
NA,"gods i n the threepenny gallery, and not to",41
NA,the people i n the stalls. I shall say no,41
NA,"more about Colonel Lee, but the Assistant",41
NA,Minister interposed with other things.,41
NA,We were told that other matters were,41
NA,"to be dealt with, and certain papers were",41
NA,introduced. Let me show the type of,41
NA,man I have to contend with . Among the,41
NA,papers was one from Adjutant-General,41
NA,"Dodds, who practically told the Minister",41
NA,that the honorable member for Bourke,41
NA,"told a deliberate half-truth, and did not",41
NA,state the other half of the t r u t h . I f any,41
NA,"one will take that report, which the",41
NA,Assistant Minister put on the table this,41
NA,"morning, and compare i t with my speech",41
NA,"in Hansard, he will notice that the very",41
NA,things which Adjutant-General Dodds,41
NA,says I left out are actually in the report,41
NA,of my speech. Then the Minister's secre-,42
NA,"tary, Mr Duffy, adds a note to say that",42
NA,a certain report was not part of the,42
NA,"report, whereas the very thing was part",42
NA,of the report. Here is another report i n,42
NA,"which there is a mass of falsifications,",42
NA,which shows that the authorities are going,42
NA,from one private to another i n order to,42
NA,get some other man to recant; b u t there,42
NA,has been no recantation. Before this,42
NA,"Parliament met, I said that I had no",42
NA,desire to introduce the matter here. I,42
NA,pointed out that there were two un-,42
NA,"deniable facts, namely, that a body of",42
NA,private soldiers had been carrying on,42
NA,looting-a n action that I never justified,42
NA,-an d that officers had been doing the,42
NA,"same thing; and, further, that, while the",42
NA,"privates had been punished, the officers",42
NA,were free. A l l I asked was that these,42
NA,privates should be released without auy,42
NA,publicity being given to facts that were,42
NA,no credit to the Army or the country.,42
NA,Such a step I regarded as only fair and,42
NA,just. This the Government refused to,42
NA,"do; and I gave them fair warning, before",42
NA,"the House met, that, unless they recon-",42
NA,"sidered their decision, I should make the",42
NA,matter public. That is my answer to the,42
NA,"honorable member for South Sydney,",42
NA,who this morning referred to me as a,42
NA,""" scavenger.""",42
Mr RILEY , I said that the House,42
NA,was doing scavenging work-al l who had,42
NA,taken part in the debate.,42
Mr ANSTEY , A l l I desired was,42
NA,"that justice should be done i n a quiet,",42
NA,unobtrusive manner; and i t is no fault,42
NA,of mine that the matter has been venti-,42
NA,lated in Parliament. We find many,42
NA,honorable members here ready to defend,42
NA,"the officers, but very few equally ready to",42
NA,defend the private soldier. I shall say,42
NA,no more about the matter. There the,42
NA,facts are; and no one can justify proceed-,42
NA,ings which result in some men being im-,42
NA,"prisoned, while others, who are proved",42
NA,"robbers, are walking about the country.",42
NA,Now I come to a more important matter.,42
NA,"From the beginning of this war, I have",42
NA,"distinctly said, time after time, that i t",42
NA,was absolute folly for the people to re-,42
NA,gard the Germans as a body of cowards,42
NA,who were constantly on the run-tha t i t,42
NA,was an absolute absurdity to tell the,42
NA,people that we were engaged in a sort of,42
NA,"picnic, and that we could march to Berlin",42
NA,whenever we pleased.,42
Mr LIVINGSTON ,Nobod y has said,42
NA,that that I have heard.,42
Mr ANSTEY , I t was said that the,42
NA,Germans would be on the run before,42
NA,"Christmas, and that we should be i n",42
NA,Berlin before tlie beginning of the year;,42
NA,"and, further, General Joffre declared",42
NA,and that he would have K i n g Albert back i n,42
NA,Belgium before that time. I t was idle to,42
NA,delude the people with the idea that we,42
NA,had an easy task. The honorable mem-,42
NA,ber for Flinders has said that this is the,42
NA,most critical juncture i n the history of,42
NA,the Empire; and the people ought to be,42
NA,taught to realize the fact. As I said,42
NA,"months ago, the fight for the existence of",42
NA,Australia as a country and an inde-,42
NA,pendent nationality is being fought on,42
NA,"the battlefields of Europe, and i f",42
NA,i t was our duty to mobilize our Forces,42
NA,"for defence, i t is equally our duty to",42
NA,mobilize all the resources of this vast,42
NA,continent' in order to provide the neces-,42
NA,saries of life for our people. A n d my,42
NA,justification for taking that stand lies i n,42
NA,the fact that there is ample power i n uiie,42
NA,Constitution at present to enable the Go-,42
NA,vernment to do all this. These powers,42
NA,lie dormant in times of peace; but the,42
NA,moment war commences they become,42
NA,"usable, and are sufficient to enable us to",42
NA,bring into play all the resources of the,42
NA,"Government and the country. We can,",42
NA,"as a matter of fact, do any mortal thing",42
NA,"we choose - We can buy, sell, com-",42
NA,mandeer ; and there is no power that can,42
NA,say us nay. We can import and buy and,42
NA,"sell wheat, and we can commandeer all",42
NA,the meat necessary to supply the British,42
NA,"Army. Who, or what, is to intervene to",42
NA,stop the exercise of these great national,42
NA,powers ? We have been told that the Go-,42
NA,vernment cannot exercise the powers;,42
NA,but we were assured this morning by the,42
NA,honorable member for Flinders that the,42
NA,Government are absolutely free to do so.,42
NA,And what is the only limitation or quali-,42
NA,fication he places on that assurance ? I t,42
NA,is that he does not know that the time,42
NA,"has arrived. That, however, is, after",42
NA,"all, only a matter of opinion; and the",42
NA,Government should have been prepared,42
NA,to take the chances the moment prices,42
NA,began to rise. But there is a smile of,42
NA,glee because some sort of excuse is at,42
NA,hand for doing nothing. For nine,42
NA,months the Government have stayed their,42
NA,"hand, and they are placed in the odious",42
NA,position that the honorable member for,42
NA,"Flinders, the right honorable member f o r",42
NA,"Parramatta, and others, who represent",42
NA,the most Conservative elements i n the,42
NA,"country, are telling them what their",43
NA,"powers are, and actually pushing them on",43
NA,to action. I t ought not to be for Con-,43
NA,servative representatives like these to,43
NA,tell a Labour Government what to do,43
NA,under the circumstances. One thing',43
NA,left to the Labour Government and,43
NA,"party, and that is to put behind them an",43
NA,the mistakes and errors of the past nine,43
NA,"months, and inaugurate an active policy.",43
NA,This ought to have been done without the,43
NA,necessity for any chiding from honor-,43
NA,able members opposite. We on this side,43
NA,ought to show that we are a party of pro-,43
NA,gress and courage-w e ought to do what,43
NA,"is necessary, and find out afterwards",43
NA,whether or not we have the j»ower to do,43
NA,it.,43
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang),43
NA,[3.36] - I wish to take advantage of this,43
NA,opportunity to ask the Minister of Home,43
NA,Affairs to look into a certain matter; but,43
NA,"in his absence from the chamber I shall,",43
NA,"in the meantime, remind honorable mem-",43
NA,"bers, who have been making such justi-",43
NA,fiable outcries against the high cost of,43
NA,"living, that this Parliament is primarily",43
NA,responsible for a good deal of what has,43
NA,"been complained of in this regard, and",43
NA,they themselves are most to blame. I f,43
NA,we had not placed such heavy duties on,43
NA,the necessary commodities and requisites,43
NA,"of everyday life, with which the poorest",43
NA,"amongst us have to be supplied, the con-",43
NA,ditions now would be much easier. We,43
NA,in tbis Parliament are not without re-,43
NA,sponsibility in a large measure for in-,43
NA,"creasing the cost of the food, cloth-",43
NA,"ing, furniture, building"" material, and",43
NA,"other necessaries of life, seeing that the",43
NA,"duties range from 20 per cent, upwards.",43
Mr BURNS ,Ho w would the honor-,43
NA,able member alter that?,43
NA,Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON -B y re-,43
NA,"tracing the steps we have taken, and re-",43
NA,"ducing the duties, which, by the votes",43
NA,"of Labour members, have increased",43
NA,the cost of living to the great bulk of,43
NA,people. I f a merchant imports £100,43
NA,"worth of goods, on which he has to pay",43
NA,"50 or 60 per cent., he has to charge for",43
NA,"those goods £150 or £160, plus interest",43
NA,"on the duty, seeing that that represents",43
NA,"money out of pocket, and the importer",43
NA,naturally passes the cost on to the con-,43
NA,"sumer. Consequently, working men's",43
NA,wives have to pay half as much again,43
NA,and more for their household necessaries.,43
NA,If honorable members are sincere in,43
NA,their desire to do something to re-,43
NA,duce the high cost of living they should,43
NA,"be prepared to do it immediately, and not",43
NA,at some time in the future. We have,43
NA,nothing tangible before us regarding all.,43
NA,is these allegations of corners in foodstuffs,43
NA,"and the operations of combines, but we",43
NA,have something tangible in the shape o f,43
NA,"extra taxation, which is so burdensome on",43
NA,the people. Are we prepared to recede,43
NA,"from the position that we have taken up,",43
NA,and reduce the cost of living imme-,43
NA,diately? We have now the opportunity,43
NA,to our hands to reduce the cost of the,43
NA,"necessaries of life, because shortly we will",43
NA,have the Tariff before us for revision.,43
NA,Are we going to do it? I for one am,43
NA,prepared to do that; but I venture to say,43
NA,that some honorable members who pro-,43
NA,fess to be the direct representatives o f,43
NA,"Labour in this Chamber, and who are so",43
NA,loud in their outcry against the high cost,43
NA,"of living, are not prepared to put into",43
NA,operation this simple remedy which would,43
NA,have the effect of making it easier and,43
NA,cheaper for the people to live.,43
Mr BURNS ,Yo u did not say this at,43
NA,the last election.,43
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON- I did,43
NA,"say i t, and have raised my voice and",43
NA,given my vote against i t all the time.,43
NA,"And, further, I have always fought for",43
NA,and advocated what I am now saying. The-,43
NA,blame for this high cost of living should,43
NA,be placed on the right shoulders-th e,43
NA,shoulders of honorable members who are,43
NA,themselves so very largely responsible for-,43
NA,it. I do not know whether any of these,43
NA,combinations which have been spoken o f,43
NA,"are in. existence, for we have not had",43
NA,one single concrete case put before us,43
NA,showing that .there has been any corner-,43
NA,"ing of food by any combine, trust, cor-",43
NA,"poration, or organization. I t is true we",43
NA,"have had some vague allusions, but",43
NA,nothing tangible has been presented to,43
NA,"the us, and I say, unhesitatingly, that a good",43
NA,deal of this talk is indulged in simply,43
NA,to disguise from the workers the real,43
NA,truth about the matter-t o distract at-,43
NA,tention from their own culpability in,43
NA,regard to it. I f honorable members are-,43
NA,really sincere in their desire to assist the,43
NA,workers they will show their sincerity by,43
NA,reducing the iniquitous taxes which have,43
NA,been placed on the backs of all those-,43
NA,who have families to provide for-,43
NA,and look after. There is one other matter,43
NA,that specially concerns the Minister con-,44
NA,trolling the Home Affairs Department to,44
NA,which I desire to again draw his atten-,44
NA,tion. I t is in reference to resump-,44
NA,tions in the Liverpool military area.,44
NA,"This again concerns the wage-earners,",44
NA,"and not people of wealth, who are able",44
NA,"to fight their battles in the Courts of law,",44
NA,and in that way to withstand the tyrannies,44
NA,of the Home Affairs Department.,44
NA,this case the men concerned are not men,44
NA,"of wealth and substance, who can afford",44
NA,"to fight the Government, but poor working",44
NA,"men, dependent upon their daily wages,",44
NA,and their treatment by the Department,44
NA,"is, in my opinion, very unjust. Their",44
NA,"land is required for military purposes,",44
NA,and the departmental valuation is an ab-,44
NA,surdly low one.,44
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Wha t lands are these ?,44
NA,"Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON"" -The y",44
NA,are lands in the Liverpool area.,44
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Bu t that is a big,44
NA,area; what part do you refer to?,44
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I,44
NA,brought this matter personally under the,44
NA,notice of the Minister some time ago.,44
NA,The owners concerned are the Messrs.,44
NA,Walton.. I have explained the details of,44
NA,the case to the Minister. This land is,44
NA,"situated only 13 miles from Sydney, and",44
NA,yet the Government have offered them,44
NA,only £3 per acre for it. I f the Govern-,44
NA,ment did not require the land it could,44
NA,be sold for suburban allotments at a much,44
NA,higher price than thab offered by the De-,44
NA,partment.,44
Mr FENTON , I am afraid you are,44
NA,"going in for a "" stone-wall.""",44
NA,"Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -No , I their",44
NA,am not; but I have not been able to,44
NA,"justice for these men by any other means,",44
NA,and I am forced to bring the matter,44
NA,fore Parliament in order that the owners,44
NA,may not be victimized by being comwith,44
NA,pelled to sell for such a miserable sum,44
NA,-of money as something like £ 3 an acre.,44
NA,I venture to say that there is not an,44
NA,of land within 13 miles of Melbourne,44
NA,'Sydney that is not worth at least £5,44
NA,"acre, and very little of i t could",44
NA,that figure.,44
Mr BURNS , I paid as much per foot,44
NA,as that for land within a similar distance.,44
NA,"Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Yes ,",44
NA,I am - aware . that land a similar disthen.,44
NA,tance from Sydney has been sold at a,44
NA,price much higher per foot than that,44
NA,the Department is offering per acre,44
NA,"this land, which is situated in the neigh-",44
NA,bourhood of George's River and Suther-,44
NA,land.,44
Mr WEBSTER ,Surel y one test case,44
NA,would settle this matter.,44
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Bu t,44
NA,what is the Department doing? I t is,44
NA,apparently using its power to harass,44
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Tha t is absolutely in-,44
NA,In correct.,44
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I say,44
NA,it is not incorrect.,44
Mr ARCHIBALD ,An d I say it is in-,44
NA,corrGCt.,44
NA,. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -Ther e,44
NA,"has been a delay for two or three years,",44
NA,and yet the owners have not had satisfac-,44
NA,tion. They are paying municipal rates,44
NA,"and other charges, and the Department",44
NA,persists in offering only a paltry sum for,44
NA,land that is worth at least double the,44
NA,amount offered. I n my opinion that is,44
NA,"victimization. On the face of it, land so",44
NA,close to Sydney must be worth more than,44
NA,"that. I do not care where it is, if i t is",44
NA,situated so close to the capital cities of,44
NA,"Australia, i t is worth more than tbe price",44
NA,offered by the Government.,44
Mr BURNS ,Ho w far is it from,44
NA,Sutherland?,44
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I,44
NA,think i t is about 3 miles.,44
Mr BURNS ,Yo u would pay 10s. per,44
NA,foot for it there.,44
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -O f,44
NA,"course, the owners feel they are being",44
NA,"unjustly dealt with, but they do not want",44
NA,to be forced into the Courts. Men in,44
NA,position are not able to bear the ex-,44
NA,get pense of a test case. They might lose,44
NA,their employment if they absented them-,44
NA,beselves from work to fight the Government,44
NA,in the Law Courts. This is the position,44
NA,regard to these men. They have only,44
NA,"their daily wages to depend upon, and I",44
NA,think they deserve more generous treat-,44
NA,acre ment at the hands of the Department.,44
NA,or The Department should err on the side,44
NA,an of generosity rather than play the part,44
NA,be got at of a skinflint or a Shylock.,44
Mr ARCHIBALD ,W e always do err on,44
NA,the side of generosity. Why did you not,44
NA,tell me that you were going to dig this,44
NA,up? I would have been ready for you,44
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I did,44
NA,"which not do so, because the Minister was",44
NA,"for away in Newcastle, but I brought this",44
NA,matter before the Minister personally,45
NA,some time ago. I have gone into it with,45
NA,"his officers, and have asked them to ex-",45
NA,plain how i t is that as high as £8 an acre,45
NA,has been offered for land adjoining that,45
NA,"to which I am referring, and yet this",45
NA,"land, which is said to be greatly superior",45
NA,"to the other land, is valued at a lower",45
NA,rate. I will leave the matter for the pre-,45
NA,"' sent, and will deal with i t again, i f neces-",45
NA,"sary, when the Estimates of the Home",45
NA,Affairs Department come up for discus-,45
NA,"sion. I n the meantime, the Minister can",45
NA,"look into the case again, and in coming to",45
NA,"a decision upon it, I ask him to use hi3",45
NA,"own common sense, and not to depend",45
NA,entirely upon the opinions of valuers em-,45
NA,"ployed in his Department, which are not",45
NA,always infallible. The fact that the land,45
NA,to which I refer is only 13 miles from,45
NA,Sydney is. proof on the face of it that it,45
NA,is worth more than the owners have been,45
NA,offered for it.,45
Mr ARCHIBALD ,I t is a matter of,45
NA,valuation. Does the honorable member,45
NA,want me to go and value it?,45
Mr ELLIOT JOHNSON , I have not,45
NA,"asked the Minister to value it, but I do",45
NA,ask him to get some independent outside,45
NA,"valuation, from a recognised competent",45
NA,firm in the city of Sydney. I ask him,45
NA,to require his officers to explain how it is,45
NA,that land adjoining the land to which I,45
NA,"have referred, but less favorably situated",45
NA,from the point of view of access to the,45
NA,"railway and utility, should be valued at",45
NA,"£7 per acre, whilst only £3 per acre is",45
NA,offered for this land. I will give the,45
NA,Minister some papers I have connected,45
NA,"with the matter, and I hope that he will",45
NA,"review it, and will see that these men are",45
NA,not persecuted. I have spoken with some,45
NA,"little heat, but i t is because I feel that in",45
NA,this case a gross injustice is being,45
NA,attempted.,45
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Richmond) [3.53] -I t,45
NA,was my iutention to speak at some length,45
NA,on the subject which has occupied the at-,45
NA,tention of honorable members during this,45
NA,"debate, and on the lines of the speeches",45
NA,delivered by the Leader of the Opposi-,45
NA,tion and the honorable member for Flin-,45
NA,"ders. I n view of the hour, and the de-",45
NA,sire of honorable members to get away.,45
NA,I shall do little more than express mv ful],45
NA,indorsement of all that those honorable,45
NA,"gentlemen have said. I feel, and have",45
NA,"felt for a long time, that honorable mem-",45
NA,bers and the people of Australia gene-,45
NA,fil37],45
NA,"rally, have not been fully alive to the",45
NA,seriousness of the oosition in which we,45
NA,are placed at the present time. We have,45
NA,been playing with the matter of our par-,45
NA,ticipation in the war almost from the be-,45
NA,ginning. When we take into considera-,45
NA,tion the relative wealth and population,45
NA,of the Commonwealth as compared with,45
NA,"other parts of the Empire, to which i t is",45
NA,so often our proudest boast to say that we,45
NA,"belong, and then contrast what we have",45
NA,accomplished with what i t is possible for,45
NA,"us to do, we should hide our heads in",45
NA,"shame, instead of blowing our own praises",45
NA,from the housetops as we have been,45
NA,doing. There is a vast deal for Australia,45
NA,yet to do before we shall have done our,45
NA,fair share in connexion with the tremen-,45
NA,dous struggle in which we are engaged.,45
Mr WEBSTER ,Th e honorable member,45
NA,and his party proposed that we should,45
NA,"send 20,000 troops.",45
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Tha t is an instance cf,45
NA,what I mean. I am not complaining at,45
NA,all of the number of troops sent away iu,45
NA,the first instance. That Australia should,45
NA,have been able in the first instance to,45
NA,"mobilize and send to the front 20,000",45
NA,soldiers was a great achievement well car-,45
NA,ried out. But what we have never fully,45
NA,realized is that that was only the begin-,45
NA,ning. For a long time it was not pro-,45
NA,posed to send any more troops to tlie,45
NA,front. I t should be the business of the,45
NA,Government to set to work to organize,45
NA,this community from top to bottom.,45
Mr JENSEN ,The y have done so and,45
NA,the honorable member knows it.,45
Mr MASSYGREENE , I cannot see any signs,45
NA,"of it. The Government have, in my",45
NA,"opinion, entirely failed to carry out the",45
NA,organization of the manufacturing and,45
NA,commercial industries of the country.,45
Mr JENSEN ,Hav e we not done that?,45
NA,We have commandeered practically every,45
NA,woollen mill and everv yard of stuff,45
NA,turned out here.,45
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Tha t is not what I am,45
NA,talking about. I say that the Defence,45
NA,Department should at the present moment,45
NA,be in possession of information as to the,45
NA,capabilities of every manufacturing con-,45
NA,cern in the Commonwealth. A great,45
NA,deal still remains to be done. I feel con-,45
NA,vinced that we are as yet only upon the,45
NA,verge of this great struggle. When we,45
NA,recognise the wonderful organization of,45
NA,"Germany, and contrast what the Ger-",45
NA,mans have been able to do in struggling,45
NA,for life against practically the whole,45
NA,"world, with what we have done; and when",46
NA,we recognise at the same time that our,46
NA,very existence depends upon the subjuga-,46
NA,"tion of that great Power, we must admit",46
NA,the necessity of immediately getting to,46
NA,work. We should abandon altogether the,46
NA,methods that have been adopted up to,46
NA,this time. We should start afresh from,46
NA,"this moment, and do our utmost to organ-",46
NA,ize this country in such a way that i t,46
NA,will be possible for us to apply every,46
NA,conceivable element of our national,46
NA,strength and wealth to further the success,46
NA,of the Empire in the great struggle in,46
NA,which we are engaged. I hope that the,46
NA,"Government will lead the country, and",46
NA,will not be satisfied with what has been,46
NA,accomplished so far.,46
Mr FENTON ,Wil l the honorable mem-,46
NA,ber follow them?,46
Mr MASSYGREENE ,"Yes , I will follow",46
NA,"them if, in my opinion, their ..action is",46
NA,such as will further the interests of the,46
NA,British Empire. I f i t will tend to,46
NA,"strengthen this country, and better fit us",46
NA,to succeed in the great struggle in which,46
NA,"we are engaged, I venture to say that the",46
NA,Government can look for the support of,46
NA,every member of the Opposition. The,46
NA,conduct of the Opposition since the Go-,46
NA,vernment were returned to power is an,46
NA,"earnest of their intention, and a proof",46
NA,that they are prepared to do their utmost,46
NA,to further the efforts of the Government,46
NA,in that direction. I n nearly every chan-,46
NA,"nel to which we turn our attention, thero",46
NA,is evidence that the Government have not,46
NA,gathered up every possible resource.,46
NA,I received a letter only the other,46
NA,day from an old soldier in my elec-,46
NA,"torate, a man named Winterden, for",46
NA,whom I have the highest respect. Ha,46
NA,offered his services to the Government to,46
NA,"train troops, but his offer was turned",46
NA,"down, although he holds from Lord",46
NA,Methuen and from Sir Ian Hamilton th9,46
NA,highest credentials which I believe it is,46
NA,possible for a soldier to hold. He has,46
NA,trained troops in nearly every part of,46
NA,"Australia, and has had an almost con-",46
NA,tinuous term of service in connexion with,46
NA,the Imperial or Australian troops for,46
NA,thirty-seven years.,46
Mr THOMAS ,Wha t is his age now?,46
Mr MASSYGREENE ,H e is a man of from,46
NA,fifty two to fifty-five years of age. Al-,46
NA,:,46
NA,most from boyhood he has been connected,46
NA,with the Army. An Area Officer in tha,46
NA,"district of Lismore, for whom Winterden",46
NA,"entertains, no very kindly feelings, has re-",46
NA,ported that this man is unable to com-,46
NA,mand respect. The Area Officer has,46
NA,just come from a training camp. He,46
NA,has had no experience in the handling,46
NA,"of troops, has not seen any active ser-",46
NA,"vice, and has practically only just re-",46
NA,ceived his commission. Winterden natu-,46
NA,rally took serious exception to the report,46
NA,of this officer at the time. He complained,46
NA,to the Commanding Officer that the re-,46
NA,port reflected upon his character as a,46
NA,"soldier, and should be withdrawn. The",46
NA,Commandant of the district would not,46
NA,"withdraw it. Consequently, Winterden",46
NA,handed in his resignation. I do not won-,46
NA,der at his action in the circumstances,46
NA,The charge against him was unsubstan-,46
NA,"tiated-indeed , i t was not inquired into.",46
NA,"But he has now come along, and said, in",46
NA,"effect, "" I am willing to allow bygones",46
NA,"to be bygones, and to place my services",46
NA,"at the disposal of the Government."" Yet",46
NA,the authorities have not accepted his offer.,46
NA,They have merely replied that i t has been,46
NA,noted and declined. Here is a man who,46
NA,"is surely competent to train troops, and",46
NA,we know that Australia has not too many,46
NA,competent instructors at the present time.,46
NA,This is merely another illustration that,46
NA,"all which could be done has not been done,",46
NA,either on the military or on the civil side.,46
NA,I urge the Government to do more in the,46
NA,future.,46
Mr FLEMING ,Robertson) [4.2] - I,46
NA,would not trespass on the time of the,46
NA,"Committee at this juncture, but for the",46
NA,circumstance that I was unavoidably ab-,46
NA,sent when the Defence Estimates were,46
NA,under review. I wish cordially to in-,46
NA,dorse the remarks of many honorable,46
NA,members upon this question of defence.,46
NA,I t altogether overshadows any other ques-,46
NA,tion. I desire to offer a few reasons why,46
NA,we are not sending as many men to the,46
NA,front as we should be sending. The first,46
NA,reason is to be found in the dislocation,46
NA,which has been shown to exist in the busi-,46
NA,ness aspect of the defence question as dis-,46
NA,closed in the report of Mr MCC. Anderson.,46
NA,I should like to know how far the Govern-,46
NA,ment have gone in the direction of mend-,46
NA,ing things. That report shows conclu-,46
NA,sively that the lack of business methods,46
NA,which has characterized our Naval and,46
NA,Military Forces is indeed a serious matter.,46
Mr JENSEN ,I t does not.,46
Mr FLEMING ,Th e report shows,46
NA,it most definitely. I also desire to say a,46
NA,word or two upon the attitude adopted,47
NA,many of our military omcers. Last seswho,47
NA,"sion, the honorable member for Wannon continues-",47
NA,and myself drew attention to the class of,47
NA,horses that was being supplied to men goparade,47
NA,"ing to the front.. I can say from a lifesure,",47
NA,"long experience of horses that a great horses,",47
NA,many of the animals were of the wrong,47
NA,stamp. They were horses of a quality,47
NA,which any horseman would describe as parades,47
NA,""" joeys,"" which is about the most conparade",47
NA,temptible term that a man can apply to a,47
NA,"horse. They would "" shut up "" just when",47
NA,one wanted them to do something. When,47
NA,"we directed attention to this matter,",47
NA,Prime Minister referred our remarks,47
NA,"the military authorities, with the result",47
NA,that a report was received from Major,47
NA,"Purcell, which I propose to quote. That",47
NA,report is of a character which is damaging,47
NA,recruiting throughout the country dislikely,47
NA,tricts. I t reads-,47
NA,The whole of the horses purchased in this,47
NA,State for the Expeditionary Force (with,47
NA,exception of an early commission given,47
NA,Messrs. Dalgety and Company by the late,47
NA,"Minister of Defence, Senator Millen, and",47
NA,"of these were issued if not veterinarily sound),",47
NA,have been subjected to a searching veterinary,47
NA,"examination, and only those horses that passed",47
NA,a severe veterinary test were issued to,47
NA,troops. It is a well-established fact that,47
NA,fantry regiments contain a very small percentthat,47
NA,"age of horsey men, the officers being par-",47
NA,"ticularly lacking in knowledge of horses,",47
NA,to intrust horses to their care is exceedingly,47
NA,"risky. The horses, sent to the infantry units",47
NA,"Broadmeadows, and which paraded with them",47
NA,"through Melbourne, left the remount depot in",47
NA,"good, fresh condition, and were thoroughly",47
NA,sound. Owing to the unfavorable conditions,47
NA,they were subjected to by their inexperienced,47
NA,"masters, and to the trying weather conditions,",47
NA,they certainly suffered somewhat in condition.,47
NA,"To my mind, that is a very mean statethey",47
NA,"ment to make. Whilst i t is true that,",47
NA,"from a veterinary stand-point, a great",47
NA,number of the horses were of first-rate,47
NA,"quality, many of them were of decidedly",47
NA,poor quality. They were animals that,47
NA,"would "" cut up "" under the best possible",47
NA,"conditions. For Major Purcell, who is",47
NA,"the author of this report, and who, I",47
NA,"informed, is an overbearing officer, to",47
NA,saddle the blame on the drivers of the,47
NA,"animals, appears to me to be very great",47
NA,"mean. His and similar actions are,",47
NA,"to my knowledge, doing a lot to",47
NA,prevent bushmen coming forward and,47
NA,offering their services for the front. They,47
NA,"know their side of the game, and are",47
NA,"pared to do their little bit for the Empire,",47
NA,but they are not prepared to be told that,47
NA,[137]- 2,47
NA,by they do not know their business by those,47
NA,know nothing about i t . The report,47
NA,If some of them appeared untractable on,47
NA,"it was probably due, in a great mea-",47
NA,to the fact tbat they were all country,47
NA,"unused to city conditions, and to the",47
NA,fact that they were badly handled by those,47
NA,under whose control they were. An idea seems,47
NA,to obtain among the uninitiated that these,47
NA,"are show parades,, and that the best",47
NA,horseflesh on hand is selected on the day of,47
NA,to create an impression.,47
NA,"As I have already remarked, I do not know",47
NA,Major Purcell. He may be a man of ex-,47
NA,"the perience, but I think the odds are thab",47
NA,to theT honorable member for Wannon and,47
NA,myself have seen a great deal more coun-,47
NA,try pass under our stirrups than he has.,47
NA,"When, therefore, he comes forward and",47
NA,""" dubs "" us as "" uninitiated,"" how is he",47
NA,to treat the men under his control ¥,47
NA,We have been told that we should beware,47
NA,"of martial law, and no doubt we should.",47
NA,the When we get a report like that from,47
NA,"to Major Purcell, i t makes us wonder what",47
NA,sort of Ireatment the men under his com-,47
NA,none mand will receive. There is another mat-,47
NA,"ter upon which I desire to touch, namely,",47
NA,the feeding of the horses. I n New South,47
NA,"the Wales, the State Government have fixed",47
NA,"inthe price of lucerne hay, with the result",47
NA,"a great deal of lucerne which, i n",47
NA,"and other circumstances, would have been con-",47
NA,"verted into hay, is now being fed off be-",47
NA,at cause by that means the producers can,47
NA,make more money out of i t . As a conse-,47
NA,"quence, fodder, which was already scarce",47
NA,"in Australia, is daily becoming scarcer.",47
NA,I t seems to me that the authorities should,47
NA,do something to insure a sufficient quan-,47
NA,"tity of fodder for their horses, because",47
NA,must recognise that fodder i n Aus-,47
NA,tralia is extremely short. The military,47
NA,authorities should take decisive steps to,47
NA,see that a sufficient supply is forthcoming,47
NA,to insure their horses being kept in pro-,47
NA,per condition. I had intended to say a,47
NA,good deal i n connexion with the prepara-,47
NA,tion of Australia for defence purposes.,47
NA,am But as we are at present-t o use a col-,47
NA,"loquialism- "" up against i t , "" I propose to",47
NA,pass over that matter. We know that a,47
NA,deal has to be done i n the way of,47
NA,preparing Australia for defence purposes.,47
NA,We know that railways require to be con-,47
NA,structed-no t merely the strategic railway,47
NA,"mentioned by the Prime Minister, but also",47
NA,a railway from Singleton to Carlingford.,47
NA,prefor the purpose of obviating the neces-,47
NA,sity for crossing the Hawkesbury River.,47
NA,"The latter may be, as an honorable mem-",48
NA,"ber interjects, a State matter; but there",48
NA,is a number of things of that sort in respect,48
NA,to which the Federal Parliament couid,48
NA,exercise its influence to bring about the,48
NA,desired conditions. Is the strategic rail-,48
NA,way of the Prime Minister to run only,48
NA,through Commonwealth territory? Not,48
NA,at all. This Parliament can bring its in-,48
NA,fluence to bear in many directions to,48
NA,i.nake the future of Australia more secure;,48
NA,"but, to my mind, these things should be",48
NA,put on one side for consideration in the,48
NA,"future, because there never was a time",48
NA,when the Parliament of a country could,48
NA,"more decidedly say than if, can now, "" Let",48
NA,"to-morrow take care of itself."" We",48
NA,should put ourselves in a position to fight,48
NA,"the battles of the Empire at the front,",48
NA,and to keep up supplies to the men. We,48
NA,"have to supply the necessaries of life, to",48
NA,"equip and arm men, and to provide the",48
NA,munitions of war. Were this a suitable,48
NA,time I would deal at some length with,48
NA,"the position as regards production, be-",48
NA,cause it is undoubtedly in a worse state,48
NA,to-day than ever i t was. We know well,48
NA,that our currency is tremendously in-,48
NA,flated. We know that we shall have to,48
NA,meet that inflation of currency with a,48
NA,solid amount of gold when the war is,48
NA,ended. What are we going to do in,48
NA,Australia to produce that gold? We,48
NA,know that there is any number of areas,48
NA,where gold could be produced if a little,48
NA,encouragement were given. This Parlia-,48
NA,ment could do much at this juncture to,48
NA,"open up those areas, especially in the",48
NA,Northern Territory. During the last few,48
NA,years the gold production of Australia,48
NA,"has fallen from, I think, £16,000,000,",48
NA,"in 1903, to about £9,000,000 or",48
NA,"£10,000,000 last year. The decrease",48
NA,"has been steady and regular, and now is",48
NA,the time when we should set about to,48
NA,see if we cannot stimulate our gold pro-,48
NA,"duction, so that we may have one of the",48
NA,very necessary things to avert the finan-,48
NA,"cial crisis which will threaten us, and will",48
NA,need some dodging at the end of the war.,48
Mr JENSEN ,I s not that socialistic?,48
Mr FLEMING , I am not afraid of,48
NA,any person calling my proposal socialis-,48
NA,tic; I never have been. I believe in do-,48
NA,ing anything which I think will make,48
NA,"for the good of the community, whatever",48
NA,it is labelled. The Government are not,48
NA,"prepared, I fear, to view this matter",48
NA,from the broad and generous stand-point,48
NA,of trying to enable the Commonwealth,48
NA,to meet the position of to-day and the,48
NA,conditions which we know must arise,48
NA,after the war. The best thing we,48
NA,can do now to put ourselves in a,48
NA,"decent position, to uphold our little",48
NA,"bit in the war is, I think, to send",48
NA,"all the men we can get to the front,",48
NA,and increase the production which will be,48
NA,necessary to feed those men and the,48
NA,people in the Old Country. I t has been,48
NA,reported in many newspapers that the,48
NA,Prime Minister has remarked from the,48
NA,"platform, as well as in this chamber,",48
NA,"that Australia is prepared to send "" its",48
NA,"last man and its last shilling,"" but what",48
NA,is the use of him talking in that way?,48
NA,What are we doing witli the large inert,48
NA,body of men who stand between the pre-,48
NA,sent recruits and tbe last man he talks of ?,48
NA,That is the question which we have to,48
NA,settle to-day. I t is of no use for the right,48
NA,honorable gentleman to talk in that gran-,48
NA,diloquent fashion. I t will be a long,48
NA,"while before we get to "" the last man and",48
NA,"the last shilling."" Unless the Govern-",48
NA,ment do something to stimulate recruit-,48
NA,"ing, to remove the barriers I have hinted",48
NA,"at, and arouse some enthusiasm in con-",48
NA,"nexion with the war, we shall never get",48
NA,"down to "" our last man "" or "" our last",48
NA,"shilling,"" or anything near it. Without",48
NA,labouring the question or delaying the,48
NA,Committee at a time when it does not wish,48
NA,"to be detained, i t appears to be that both",48
NA,"sides of the House have done too little,",48
NA,"and that i t is up to us to do, as the Leader",48
NA,"of the Opposition said to-day, all that",48
NA,Australia can do in the way of putting,48
NA,"men into the field, keeping up a regular",48
NA,"supply of reinforcements, and seeing that",48
NA,every inducement is offered to our citizens,48
NA,to render that service to the Empire,48
NA,which the present crisis demands of them.,48
NA,We have the men and the money. A l l,48
NA,that we want to do is to put tbe men in,48
NA,"the right place, and maintain them there",48
NA,"in increasing strength, which Australia",48
NA,can well do if the Government and the,48
NA,Parliament will only unite in an effort,48
NA,"to arouse enthusiasm, to keeo up produc-",48
NA,"tion, and make Australia play her part",48
NA,"as she wants to play it, if she is only",48

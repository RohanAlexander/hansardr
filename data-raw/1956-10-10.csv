NA,AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.,12
Mr CLAREY ,I s the Prime Minister,12
NA,aware of the serious position developing,12
NA,"in the aircraft industry, particularly",12
NA,establishments of the Commonwealth Airbasis,12
NA,"craft Corporation, because of the lack",12
NA,announced plans about future aircraft conabolished,12
NA,struction following the completion of,12
NA,Sabre jet programme? Will the right to,12
NA,honorable gentleman have this matter,12
NA,discussed at the defence conference which,12
NA,"commenced to-day, and will he, in contralia,",12
NA,"junction with the Ministers for Air, Supply",12
NA,"and Defence Production, receive a deputathem.",12
NA,tion of Commonwealth Aircraft Corporathat,12
NA,tion employees which will arrive in Canour,12
NA,berra to-morrow?,12
Mr MENZIES ,Th e problem of the,12
NA,aircraft construction programme is one,12
NA,which has already engaged the very close,12
NA,consideration of the Government. There,12
NA,"are many aspects of it, but the important",12
NA,ones concern overall defence policy and,12
NA,"decisions. 1, myself, would not think that",12
NA,it would be extremely useful to have a depudelighted,12
NA,"tation on one aspect of this matter, but,",12
NA,knowing the interest of the honorable memopportunity,12
NA,"ber in the whole matter, I would be",12
NA,pared to set aside what he will understand,12
NA,would be a limited amount of time topowers,12
NA,"morrow, so that he may bring his deputathe",12
NA,tion to see me. I say that because the,12
NA,"tation has already been organized, and",12
NA,"know there are certain difficulties; and,",12
NA,"the second place, I realize that the honormatters",12
NA,able member is not raising this matter,12
NA,any contentious spirit at all.,12
NA,Mr Clarey -Tha t is so.,12
NA,UNIFORM TAXATION.,12
Mr WILSON ,M y question is directed,12
NA,to the Prime Minister. In view of the,12
NA,statement of the Premier of New South,12
NA,Wales that he is now willing to join the,12
NA,Premier of Victoria in challenging the,12
NA,"uniform tax act, and in view of the fact",12
NA,"that the Premier of South Australia has tently,",12
NA,consistently asked for the return of taxing,12
NA,"powers to his State and, further, in view",12
NA,the statement of the Prime Minister,12
NA,the Treasurer that the Commonwealth is,12
NA,willing to return the taxing powers to the,12
NA,"States, will the Government now intro-",12
NA,duce legislation to repeal the uniform tax,12
NA,act in order to give the States the respon-,12
NA,sibihty of collecting the revenues that they,12
NA,spend?,12
Mr MENZIES ,Th e abolition of the,12
NA,uniform tax law is something which ought,12
NA,in the not to be undertaken except on a broad,12
NA,of agreement with the State Premiers.,12
NA,"of In other words, uniform tax cannot be",12
NA,"in one State and not in another,",12
NA,the and we must have a co-operative approach,12
NA,this matter. The simple truth is that the,12
NA,"interests of the taxpayers, of whom there",12
NA,are many hundreds of thousands in Aus-,12
NA,must be considered. We do not want,12
NA,"a multiplicity of tax laws, if we can avoid",12
NA,"We want a good, sensible system",12
NA,will work. We have repeatedly stated,12
NA,views on this matter at conferences with,12
NA,the State Premiers. I do not think that,12
NA,the attitude of any one of the Premiers,12
NA,should be over-simplified. We stand by the,12
NA,statements that I have made in the past.,12
NA,If and when the Premiers are prepared to,12
NA,agree to a return of their taxing powers on,12
NA,terms which meet the various conditions,12
NA,"that I have stated, this Government will be",12
NA,to take the necessary steps. Per-,12
NA,haps I ought to take advantage of this,12
NA,to point out to honorable mem-,12
NA,prebers that the question of policy as to,12
NA,whether there should be a return of taxing,12
NA,to the States is quite different from,12
NA,legal question-whic h is now being,12
NA,"depuapproached, I gather-a s to whether this",12
NA,I Parliament has the power to pass a uniform,12
NA,in taxation law. I want to keep those two,12
NA,in separate compartments. We can-,12
NA,in not interpret the Commonwealth Constitu-,12
NA,tion by consent. No doubt the High Court,12
NA,will give its view on the legal issue in due,12
NA,"course. On the matter of policy, I have",12
NA,nothing to state in modification of the views,12
NA,which I have expressed on behalf of this,12
NA,Government to Premiers conferences more,12
NA,"than once, but I suggest to my friend, the",12
NA,"honorable member for Sturt, that we can-",12
NA,"not operate on the basis of one, two, or",12
NA,three of the Premiers being in that mood.,12
NA,"Indeed, I venture to suggest that, inadver-",12
NA,he has rather over-simplified the view,12
NA,"of my friend, the Premier of South Aus-",12
NA,of tralia. His view has never seemed to mc,12
NA,and to be quite so simple as that.,12
NA,TELEPHONE SERVICES.,13
Mr COSTA ,I n answer to a question,13
NA,"last week, the Postmaster-General stated",13
NA,"lhat 85,000 applications for telephone ser-",13
NA,vices in Australia were outstanding. Will,13
NA,he inform the House now whether the,13
NA,amendment of the regulations has been,13
NA,made which will have the effect of inflicting,13
NA,a £10 installation fee on all new applicants,13
NA,for telephones? Will the Minister say how,13
NA,"many of the 85,000 outstanding applica-",13
NA,tions are regarded as new applications? I,13
NA,understand that most of the applicants have,13
NA,been waiting for several years for a tele-,13
NA,phone service. In answer to a previous,13
NA,"question on this matter, the Minister said",13
NA,that if a proposal had already been made to,13
NA,an applicant regarding the installation oi,13
NA,"a telephone, the installation fee would not",13
NA,be charged. Will the Minister state what he,13
NA,"means by "" a proposal""?",13
Mr DAVIDSON ,Th e regulations that,13
NA,will vary telephone charges and other,13
NA,charges made by the Postal Department,13
NA,"have been promulgated. There were 86,000",13
NA,outstanding applications at that time. I do,13
NA,not quite know what the honorable member,13
NA,means when he asks me to say how many,13
NA,of them are regarded as new applications.,13
NA,"With regard to the £10 installation fee,",13
NA,the position is as I have stated it previously,13
NA,to the House. In all cases where an appli-,13
NA,cation has been processed by the depart-,13
NA,ment to the extent that the department,13
NA,has made a proposal to the prospective,13
NA,subscriber indicating what the rental of,13
NA,"the telephone will be, and has received from",13
NA,him a notification of acceptance of the,13
NA,"department's terms, and where the prospec-",13
NA,tive subscriber has paid the first year's,13
NA,"rental before 1st October, the installation",13
NA,tee of £10 will not be charged. We found,13
NA,during the last week or two weeks that some,13
NA,applicants who had had telephones installed,13
NA,did not know whether an installation fee,13
NA,of £10 was payable. I have found one or,13
NA,two instances of the fees having been asked,13
NA,"for, really inadvertently, and I have issued",13
NA,instructions that the statement I made in,13
NA,this House stands. If there has been any,13
NA,case in the last week or two of the fee of,13
NA,£10 having been asked for and paid when,13
NA,"the rental has been paid before 1st October,",13
NA,each such payment would be refunded. I,13
NA,want to make clear that what I have said,13
NA,in the House about the date from which,13
NA,"this fee applies will stand, and that there",13
NA,will be no departure from it.,13
NA,SUEZ CANAL.,13
Mr KENT HUGHES , I direct a ques-,13
NA,tion to the Minister for External Affairs.,13
NA,Is there any later information he can give,13
NA,to the House with respect to the discussions,13
NA,in the United Nations on the Suez ques-,13
NA,"tion, additional to what has been published",13
NA,in the press?,13
Mr CASEY ,"Yes , in the last 24 hours",13
NA,a number of countries have expressed,13
NA,themselves in the Security Council in re-,13
NA,"spect of the Suez matter, and 1 would",13
NA,expect that just about now the Security,13
NA,Council is going into secret session. Dur-,13
NA,"ing yesterday, Australian time, a number",13
NA,of countries expressed themselves on the,13
NA,"matter. Iran said, in effect, that the draft",13
NA,"resolution-tha t is, the British-French",13
NA,resolution-deserve d support in principle,13
NA,as a possible basis for peaceful negotiation,13
NA,"Belgium said, in brief, that Egypt's disre-",13
NA,gard of the 1951 resolution of the council,13
NA,regarding the blockade against Israel made,13
NA,it clear that the canal should not be left,13
NA,solely under Egyptian control. The seizure,13
NA,"of the canal, it said, was a clear violation of",13
NA,ihe 1888 convention. Nationalist China,13
NA,said that the users of the canal could have,13
NA,some measure and form of participation in,13
NA,its operation without violating Egypt's,13
NA,sovereignty. Pera said that there should be,13
NA,negotiations based on the principles of the,13
NA,United Nations Charter. Dr Ronald,13
NA,"Walker, speaking for Australia, said thai",13
NA,Egypt's repudiation of the Suez Canal con-,13
NA,"cession, without consultation or agreement,",13
NA,"was a breach of international law which,",13
NA,"if condoned, could lead to the encourage-",13
NA,"ment of further acts of lawlessness, and",13
NA,that Egypt's record in the Security Council,13
NA,was not good-fo r example. Egypt had,13
NA,disregarded the 1951 and 1954 Security,13
NA,Council resolutions against the Egyptian,13
NA,blockade directed against Israel. He said,13
NA,that the canal was of great importance to,13
NA,"Australia, and that Egypt's action in seiz-",13
NA,"ing the canal, unless remedied, was likely",13
NA,to have wide repercussions on the inter-,13
NA,national flow of capital to under-developed,13
NA,"countries, and might result in a serious set-",13
NA,back to the whole process of co-operative,13
NA,world economic development. Dr Walker,13
NA,also said that Australia was ready to partici-,14
NA,pate constructively in whatever negotiations,14
NA,might be possible. He said that Australia,14
NA,"would, of course, support the draft resolu-",14
NA,tion proposed by the United Kingdom and,14
NA,France. We have not yet received any,14
NA,news of what the representatives of Yugo-,14
NA,slavia and the United States of America,14
NA,"said yesterday, although presumably they",14
NA,would have stated their views by this time.,14
NA,"However, as I informed the House pre-",14
NA,"viously, the United States announced its",14
NA,support for the United Kingdom-French,14
NA,draft resolution last week. That is all of a,14
NA,positive nature that I am able to report in,14
NA,respect of developments in the last three or,14
NA,four hours.,14
NA,TELEPHONE SERVICES.,14
NA,Mr R. W. HOLT -I n view of the fact,14
NA,"that there are at least 1,700 applications",14
NA,telephone connexions for which spare wires,14
NA,are not available in the underground cables,14
NA,"within the electorate of Darebin, will the",14
NA,"Postmaster-General say, first, what action is",14
NA,"being taken to overcome this lag; secondly,",14
NA,what is the limiting factor on this work;,14
NA,"thirdly, whether he will expedite these",14
NA,nexions to meet the special demands of,14
NA,rapidly expanding area?,14
Mr DAVIDSON ,Th e area to which,14
NA,the honorable member has referred is sufferorganization,14
NA,ing from some of the difficulties which,14
NA,many other areas in Australia are also facthe,14
NA,ing. The department is attempting to meet,14
NA,such difficulties as rapidly as possible.,14
NA,main limiting factor in completing installain,14
NA,tions is availability of finance. As to,14
NA,honorable member's queston about when,14
NA,the position in Darebin is likely to,14
NA,"remedied, I shall make further inquiries",14
NA,advise him of the result.,14
NA,WHEAT.,14
Mr HAMILTON ,Can the Minister for,14
NA,"Primary Industry give the House any inforcause,",14
NA,mation about immediate or future payments,14
NA,"for wheat in No. 18 and No. 18A pools, and",14
NA,can he also state the total amounts that may,14
NA,be involved?,14
Mr MCMAHON ,Th e Australian pose,14
NA,Wheat Board has just approved of' extra,14
NA,payments for both No. 18 and No. !8A,14
NA,"pools, in the case of basceH wheat at 7!d.",14
NA,"a bushel, and in the case of bulk wheat at",14
NA,4id. a bushel. This brings the payment for,14
NA,No. IS pool to something like 12s. 3id. a,14
NA,"bushel for bagged wheat, and about",14
NA,"£3,500,000 will be paid to the growers in",14
NA,the latest advances in respect of both pools.,14
NA,I think the House would like to know that,14
NA,these payments will bring the total amount,14
NA,paid to growers in respect of these two,14
NA,"pools to nearly £91,000,000.",14
NA,SHIPPING FREIGHT RATES.,14
Mr COPE , I direct a question to the,14
NA,Minister for Trade. What action is the,14
NA,right honorable gentleman taking or pro-,14
NA,posing to take to prevent overseas and,14
NA,coastal shipping owners from proceeding to,14
NA,impose the additional savage increases of,14
NA,freight rates that they recently announced,14
NA,their intention to impose? Does the Minister,14
NA,agree that the shipowners are justified in,14
NA,for further exploiting Australian primary and,14
NA,secondary industries and the Australian,14
NA,public generally in the way they propose?,14
Mr MCEWEN ,Th e Department of,14
NA,Trade has no status in respect of coastal,14
NA,"and, shipping freight rates. With respect to",14
NA,"conoverseas freight rates, the relationship",14
NA,this between the people who pay the freight,14
NA,"charges-th e shippers, as they are known in",14
NA,the jargon of the trade-an d the ship-,14
NA,"owners, is recognized in statute law. An-",14
NA,known as the Australian Over-,14
NA,seas Transport Association exists to arrange,14
NA,relationship on freight matters and to,14
NA,stand between the shippers and the ship-,14
NA,The owners. That association has already been,14
NA,"contact with the shipowners, and",14
NA,the arrangements have been made for repre-,14
NA,sentatives of. the organization and of,14
NA,be the shipper interests to go to Lon-,14
NA,and don to argue their views with the,14
NA,shipowners there. I think it is well,14
NA,known to the House and to the coun-,14
NA,try that the Government is very much con-,14
NA,cerned to ensure that no additional burdens,14
NA,on our export trade shall arise from any,14
NA,"including higher freight rates, and",14
NA,"that last year the Government, without",14
NA,"specific authority, but nevertheless acting in",14
NA,"the interests of Australia, successfully inter-",14
NA,vened and induced the shipowners to im-,14
NA,freight rates substantially lower than,14
NA,those thcy had intended to impose. The,14
NA,Government will certainly watch events in,14
NA,"the present instance very carefully, and will",14
NA,"be prepared to give the benefit of its advice,",14
NA,"and, within the limits of its status and authoihc",15
NA,"rity, of its aid to the Australian exporting",15
NA,interests.,15
NA,PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.,15
Mr DRURY , I ask the Minister for,15
NA,"Territories, first, whether he can inform the",15
NA,House of the approximate annual value of,15
NA,the production of the Territory of Papua,15
NA,"and New Guinea, and, secondly, what steps",15
NA,are being taken to enable the Territory,15
NA,itself to contribute more towards meeting,15
NA,the cost of services provided there.,15
Mr HASLUCK ,I t would be very diffihas,15
NA,"cult, indeed, to give an exact answer to the",15
NA,honorable member's question regarding the,15
NA,value of production of the Territory.,15
NA,great deal of the production is devoted,15
NA,"to feeding about 1,750,000 people; it goes",15
NA,direct from the people who grew it to the,15
NA,"people who eat it, and does not enter into",15
NA,calculations of any kind. That feature,15
NA,"the economy of the Territory is, of course,",15
NA,accompanied by the fact that the standard,15
NA,"of living is rising continuously, so that",15
NA,"if production is increased, it does not",15
NA,"that any of it will be surplus. For example,",15
NA,if the area devoted to rice growing is,15
NA,"creased from 100 acres to about 3,000 acres,",15
NA,"and the people who grow the rice eat it,",15
NA,obviously it is not marketed. Their standard,15
NA,of living has risen but the increased proContact,15
NA,duction does not enter into anything that,15
NA,can be calculated as the value of the productended,15
NA,tion of the Territory. The clearest indicathere,15
NA,tion we have of the value of production,15
NA,the export trade. In the trading year,15
NA,"1955-56, the value of exports was. approxisofar",15
NA,"mately £13,250,000, which represents about",15
NA,a three-fold increase in the last five years.,15
NA,It has been the aim of the Government to,15
NA,increase steadily the contribution from local,15
NA,production to the cost of administering,15
NA,Territory and providing services.,15
NA,"In the current year, out of a total",15
NA,"public expenditure of about £13,500,000,",15
NA,"£4,250,000 will be raised from local revenue.",15
NA,"Of course, it is quite plain, I think, that",15
NA,when one has regard to the enormous tasks,15
NA,associated with the health and education of,15
NA,"the large and increasing population, a con-",15
NA,siderable contribution will have to be,15
NA,made by the people of Australia for many,15
NA,"years to come. But steadily over the years,",15
NA,we have maintained a rising rate of local,15
NA,"contribution to public expenditure and, at",15
NA,"present time, the people of the Territory",15
NA,contribute about one-third of the cost ol,15
NA,the public expenditure they enjoy.,15
NA,EUROPEAN FREE-TRADE BLOC.,15
Mr MCIVOR ,Wil l the Minister for,15
NA,Trade inform the House whether the Aus-,15
NA,tralian Government has been consulted by,15
NA,the British Government on the question ot,15
NA,Great Britain joining an economic union,15
NA,"consisting of Germany, France, Belgium.",15
NA,"Italy, Holland and Luxemburg, and if so.",15
NA,what attitude Australia has adopted in,15
NA,"relation to this very important matter, which",15
NA,many far-reaching possibilities?,15
Mr MCEWEN ,Bot h the United King-,15
NA,A dom Government and the Australian Go-,15
NA,solely vernment are aware of the proposal to,15
NA,"which the honorable member has referred,",15
NA,which may be briefly described as one for,15
NA,a free-trade area in Europe. This Govern-,15
NA,of ment has been kept advised of the details,15
NA,"of the proposal, and made aware of thc",15
NA,United Kingdom's thinking in respect of its,15
NA,even own interests. This has been done in,15
NA,"follow correspondence and cables, and, more",15
NA,"recently, by personal contacts during a",15
NA,incertain conference at Washington at which,15
NA,"the British Chancellor of the Exchequer,",15
NA,"the President of the Board of Trade, ancl",15
NA,Australian representatives were present.,15
NA,is still being maintained in London.,15
NA,"Seeing that, under the proposal, it is in-",15
NA,"to exclude foodstuffs altogether,",15
NA,is very little of Australian trade to thc,15
NA,is United Kingdom or to the sponsor coun-,15
NA,tries which would be affected directly. In-,15
NA,as there are indirect implications in,15
NA,"relation to the Australian interest, I can",15
NA,assure the honorable member that this is,15
NA,"being closely watched. As a matter of fact,",15
NA,only last night I conferred with officials,15
NA,the of my department on this very importani,15
NA,matter.,15
NA,OLYMPIC GAMES.,15
Mr STOKES ,M y question refers to a,15
NA,recent report that an air travel bottleneck,15
NA,"had developed at Manila, which is likeh",15
NA,"to prevent 268 athletes, representing nine",15
NA,"countries, from reaching Melbourne in time",15
NA,for the forthcoming Olympic Games. Can,15
NA,the Minister for Civil Aviation give the,15
NA,House an assurance that he will immediately,15
NA,take whatever steps are available to him to,15
NA,ensure that those athletes will be able to,15
NA,participate in the games? It has been stated,16
NA,that at present their chances of so doing are,16
NA,very remote.,16
Mr TOWNLEY ,I n reply to the honorshall,16
NA,"able member, 1 must confess that I do not",16
NA,know much about the particular problem,16
NA,to which he has referred. I have been,16
NA,informed that in the press to-day appears,16
NA,a report of an alleged bottleneck at Manila.,16
NA,"I have been in touch with Qantas,",16
NA,"tralia's overseas airline, and have been told",16
NA,that Qantas is aware of the position and is,16
NA,doing everything possible to remedy the territories.,16
NA,position so far as its own service is con-,16
NA,cerned. Qantas will keep in touch with,16
NA,me and I shall let the honorable member,16
NA,know how the matter turns out.,16
NA,FILM CENSORSHIP.,16
Mr KEARNEY ,I s the Minister for,16
NA,Trade and Customs aware that many films,16
NA,shown at children's matinees throughout jection,16
NA,"Australia are, in their theme, oversexed,",16
NA,"sadistic, and generally unsuitable to be disfilm",16
NA,"played to young children, and also that,",16
NA,included among these films are those classigo,16
NA,"fied by the censor as "" G "", indicating that",16
NA,they are suitable for general exhibition?,16
NA,Will the Minister consider the desirability,16
NA,of introducing a new classification,16
NA,indicate that films so classified are com-,16
NA,pletely suitable for children? I make this,16
NA,recommendation in the hope that the Minispointing,16
NA,ter will accept it as a further effort towards,16
NA,the control of films to be shown to children,16
NA,and towards the minimizing of child,16
NA,delinquency.,16
Mr OSBORNE ,Th e honorable memwhether,16
NA,ber raises in his question issues which are,16
NA,far too wide to be dealt with adequately,16
NA,"at question time. In the first place,",16
NA,not think it is true that films of a sadistic,16
NA,"nature are being shown in Australia,",16
NA,"because, after all, any film shown",16
NA,been passed by the Commonwealth Film,16
NA,Censorship Board as being fit at least,16
NA,"shown to adults. In the second place,",16
NA,"so many things in our federal system,",16
NA,authority to deal with films is divided,16
NA,between the Commonwealth and State to,16
NA,Governments. The Commonwealth Goof,16
NA,vernment is responsible for censoring,16
NA,"imported films, and in the course of",16
NA,"doing, for the convenience of State authorito",16
NA,"ties, people interested in films, and parents,",16
NA,"it classifies them in three groups: "" Suit-",16
NA,"able for general exhibition "", "" suitable for",16
NA,"adults "", or "" suitable for adults only "". The",16
NA,authority to determine whether children,16
NA,be allowed into cinemas showing films,16
NA,classified as not suitable for children rests,16
NA,entirely with the State governments. I,16
NA,cannot emphasize too strongly that this,16
NA,Government has no authority at all to pre-,16
NA,vent any child from entering into a cinema,16
NA,Ausshowing a classified film.,16
NA,Mr J. R. Fraser -Excep t in its own,16
Mr OSBORNE , 1 accept the honorable,16
NA,member's qualification. The only other,16
NA,comment I can usefully make at this stage,16
NA,is in answer to the honorable member's sug-,16
NA,gestion that an additional classification,16
NA,"should be introduced, namely, "" suitable for",16
NA,"children "". 1 will certainly have that sug-",16
NA,gestion examined. I believe that an ob-,16
NA,to this course has been raised before.,16
NA,If children themselves are aware that a,16
NA,has been classified as being suitable for,16
NA,children they develop a disinclination to,16
NA,and see it. That is only one aspect of,16
NA,"the problem, but f shall have the sugges-",16
NA,tions carefully examined.,16
NA,""" C "" to SUBSIDIES FOR PRIMARY PRODUCTS.",16
Mr LUCOCK , I preface my question,16
NA,to the Minister for Primary Industry by,16
NA,out that it is acknowledged that,16
NA,the main answer to our balance of pay-,16
NA,ments problem is increased exports. While,16
NA,I think all would agree that subsidies are,16
NA,"not a complete answer, I ask the Minister",16
NA,he will consider investigating the,16
NA,"possibility of increasing subsidies, at least",16
NA,"as a temporary expedient, on certain of our",16
NA,"I do primary products, thus enabling those",16
NA,primary industries to compete more favor-,16
NA,ably on the overseas markets and thus,16
NA,here has increase our export income.,16
Mr MCMAHON ,Th e suggestion made,16
NA,to be by the honorable member for Lyne is not,16
NA,like a novel one. I agree with him that one,16
NA,the of the answers to Australia's export or,16
NA,overseas balance of payments problem is,16
NA,"increase our exports, particularly exports",16
NA,"our primary industries. However, as to",16
NA,"subsidies, I do not think the Government",16
NA,so could give very much more consideration,16
NA,this matter and hope to come out with,16
NA,a favorable reply. In the case of a country,16
NA,"like Australia, which is perhaps the greatest",17
NA,trading country in the world per head of,17
NA,"population, two things could happen: First,",17
NA,we might embark on a trade war with com-,17
NA,"petitors who are much stronger than we,",17
NA,and therefore our prospects of success,17
NA,"would be remote; and second, we could",17
NA,"grant subsidies, but I cannot think at the",17
NA,present time that subsidies would be the,17
NA,"answer to this question, particularly when",17
NA,we are complaining so bitterly about sub-,17
NA,sidies being given by other countries to,17
NA,their export industries. I assure the honor-,17
NA,able gentleman that this problem has,17
NA,received very careful consideration by the,17
NA,"Government, but it has been decided that",17
NA,it would not be in our best interests to,17
NA,follow the course of action that he suggests.,17
NA,NORTHERN TERRITORY,17
NA,LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.,17
Mr NELSON ,Earlie r in the session,17
NA,asked the Minister for Territories whether,17
NA,it was the intention of the Government,17
NA,dissolve the Legislative Council of the,17
NA,Northern Territory and hold a general elec-,17
NA,"tion, instead of having a by-election to fill",17
NA,a vacancy that exists owing to the resigna-,17
NA,tion from the Council of an elected member.,17
NA,The Minister informed me then that the,17
NA,matter was under consideration. I now ask,17
NA,him whether a decision has been made on,17
NA,that matter.,17
Mr HASLUCK ,Th e only answer,17
NA,can give is the same as the answer I gave,17
NA,before-th e matter is still under considerathe,17
NA,tion.,17
NA,RADIO AUSTRALIA.,17
Mr WENTWORTH ,Ca n the Minister,17
NA,for External Affairs tell the House whether,17
NA,any progress has been made with the,17
NA,casting of programmes in Mandarin,17
NA,Chinese from Radio Australia?,17
Mr CASEY , I should think that this,17
NA,"question, perhaps, should be more properly",17
NA,"directed to my friend and colleague, the latest.",17
NA,"Postmaster-General, or, even, possibly, to",17
NA,both of us. The Postmaster-General and,17
NA,the Postal Department have what might be,17
NA,called executive charge of the running of,17
NA,"Radio Australia, but since the Department",17
NA,"of External Affairs is very interested,",17
NA,"indeed I am, too, in Radio Australia,",17
NA,perhaps I might be allowed to answer,17
NA,"the question. For just over three months,",17
NA,a programme in Mandarin Chinese has been,17
NA,broadcast over Radio Australia. It is,17
NA,additional to the programmes in English.,17
NA,"French, Thai and Indonesian. It is a new",17
NA,service and lasts for an hour a day every,17
NA,day. It is done entirely in Mandarin,17
NA,"Chinese, which is, I understand, the princi-",17
NA,"pal language of educated overseas Chinese,",17
NA,particularly in South-East Asia. The popu-,17
NA,larity of the broadcast has been reflected in,17
NA,"the fact that a substantial "" fan "" mail of",17
NA,"considerably more than 1,500 letters has",17
NA,been received since this service started. As,17
NA,"I said, the broadcast lasts for one hour a",17
NA,"day. Of that time, about twelve minutes",17
NA,"is devoted to news, about five minutes to",17
NA,comments on news and the remainder to a,17
NA,series of commentaries generally on the Aus-,17
NA,tralian way of life and on matters of possible,17
NA,interest between overseas Chinese in South-,17
NA,East Asia and ourselves. I think the ser-,17
NA,1 vice has been well justified and I hope that,17
NA,"it will not remain static in its present form,",17
NA,to but will progress and expand.,17
NA,CONSTITUTION REVIEW,17
NA,COMMITTEE.,17
Mr GALVIN , I desire to ask the Prime,17
NA,Minister a question similar to one that J,17
NA,put to the Treasurer during the absence of,17
NA,the Prime Minister abroad. Will the right,17
NA,I honorable gentleman inform the House,17
NA,when it is intended to fill the vacancy on,17
NA,all-party Constitution Review Commit-,17
NA,tee caused by the resignation of the chair-,17
NA,"man of the committee, Senator-no w Mr.",17
NA,Justice-Spicer ? Will he assure the House,17
NA,that there will be no undue delay in filling,17
NA,"the vacancy, thus allowing the committee",17
NA,to deal with its very important task of,17
NA,broadrecommending constitutional reform?,17
Mr MENZIES , I appreciate the point,17
NA,"made by the honorable member, and I can",17
NA,assure him that the vacancy will be filled,17
NA,in the next ten days or fortnight at the,17
NA,UNIFORM TAXATION.,17
Mr FREETH , I wish to ask the Prime,17
NA,Minister a question on the subject of uni-,17
NA,form taxation which is supplementary to,17
NA,as that asked by the honorable member for,17
NA,Sturt. Has the right honorable gentleman,17
NA,seen a proposal that the Commonwealth,17
NA,should return some limited taxing rights to,18
NA,(he States instead of making a tax reim-,18
NA,bursement supplementary to the reimburse-,18
NA,"ment under the formula, and allowing the",18
NA,"States, if they think fit. to raise, by means",18
NA,"of such transferred taxing powers, the",18
NA,extra amount of money that they require,18
NA,over and above the amount received by way,18
NA,of formula reimbursement provided they,18
NA,use the Commonwealth assessment legisla-,18
NA,tion? Will the right honorable gentleman,18
NA,"consider this proposal, which, I think, was",18
NA,first outlined in an article that appeared,18
NA,"in the "" Economic Record "" of May last?",18
NA,The suggestion seems to me to have some,18
NA,merit. If the Prime Minister considers,18
NA,"that it has, will he discuss it with the State",18
NA,Premiers?,18
Mr MENZIES,I n spite of my,18
NA,advanced years I have a lively recollection,18
NA,"of 1934, when, as Acting Premier of Vic-",18
NA,"toria, I advanced a similar proposal, at",18
NA,"a Premiers conference, to that outlined by",18
NA,the honorable member. My clear recol-,18
NA,"lection is that it was not very well received,",18
NA,and I am very interested to hear that the,18
NA,proposal has been resuscitated. I am pre-,18
NA,"pared, of course, to consider to-day what",18
NA,"I advocated 22 years ago, but the honorable",18
NA,"member will, of course, realize that the",18
NA,problem is a pretty complex one. I and my,18
NA,"colleagues have, from first to last, wished",18
NA,io devise a system under which the restora-,18
NA,tion of taxing authority to the States would,18
NA,be accompanied by as great a degree of,18
NA,"uniformity as possible, so that there would",18
NA,not be a duplication of returns or a multi-,18
NA,plicity of conflicting laws. We stand ready,18
NA,at all times to consider any suggestion along,18
NA,"those lines. No State has, in what are",18
NA,"termed modern times, put forward a sug-",18
NA,gestion that it should be given some form,18
NA,of taxing power now exclusive to the Com-,18
NA,monwealth. As the honorable member,18
NA,"clearly understands, of course, any proposal",18
NA,that a particular kind of tax now exclusive,18
NA,to the Commonwealth should be made,18
NA,available to the States would involve a con-,18
NA,"stitutional amendment, to which the people",18
NA,"would have to agree, and experience does",18
NA,not suggest that people vote very heartily in,18
NA,favour of proposals that some one else,18
NA,should have a chance to tax them. That,18
NA,"seems to me to be one of the facts of life,",18
NA,"but hope springs eternal, and I am always",18
NA,prepared to try anything.,18
NA,AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.,18
Mr BRYANT ,I s the Minister for De-,18
NA,fence Production aware that airline opera-,18
NA,tors are reported to be finding difficulty,18
NA,in obtaining aircraft overseas? In view,18
NA,of the present concern within the industrj',18
NA,at the threat of unemployment and the,18
NA,collapse of aircraft manufacturing generally,18
NA,"in this country, will the Minister consider",18
NA,arranging for the manufacture in the .go-,18
NA,vernment factories of aircraft suitable for,18
NA,"civilian and defence purposes, such as. for",18
NA,"example, a modern equivalent of the DC37",18
Sir ERIC HARRISON ,Thi s question,18
NA,"has, quite obviously, been wrongly directed,",18
NA,and as it relates to a matter of Government,18
NA,policy I cannot give the honorable member,18
NA,an answer.,18
NA,AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES.,18
Mr DRUMMOND , I direct a question,18
NA,"to the Minister for the Army, and preface",18
NA,it by saying that about four years ago Army,18
NA,authorities approached the pastoral and,18
NA,agricultural association of Glen innes with,18
NA,a view to securing a lease of the show-,18
NA,ground in that town for army training pur-,18
NA,"poses, when it was not being used for show",18
NA,purposes. This lease they obtained. I ask the,18
NA,Minister whether it is a fact that since then,18
NA,the association has not been able to make a,18
NA,fixed arrangement with the Army. Is it,18
NA,also a fact that within the last eighteen,18
NA,months the association has endeavoured to,18
NA,obtain army assistance to repair the road,18
NA,"leading into the showground, which had",18
NA,been damaged by army transport? As pre-,18
NA,parations are now being made for the,18
NA,"annual show, will the Minister agree to the",18
NA,request of the association that a senior,18
NA,officer of the Department of the Army be,18
NA,sent to Glen Innes so that the four-year-old,18
NA,negotiations may be concluded? In con-,18
NA,"sidering this matter, will he bear in mind",18
NA,the possibility that public opinion may be,18
NA,influenced by the fact that negotiations,18
NA,have been in progress for this length of,18
NA,"time, and that people may conclude that a",18
NA,department which takes four years to settle,18
NA,a simple question is hardly to be trusted,18
NA,with the proper mobilization of Australia's,18
NA,defences?,18
Mr CRAMER ,M y great regret is that,18
NA,the bonorable member has not mentioned,18
NA,this matter to me before to-day. I should,18
NA,"have been very pleased to look into it, and",19
NA,I am confident that it could have been satis-,19
NA,factorily explained. As it has its origin,19
NA,"in the past, I have no knowledge of it.",19
NA,"I may say that, in my experience, the",19
NA,Army has always been co-operative in,19
NA,"matters of this kind, and I am sure that",19
NA,there must be some other aspect that the,19
NA,honorable member has not mentioned. I,19
NA,shall certainly investigate it to see what can,19
NA,"be 'done, and can promise the honorable",19
NA,member an early reply.,19
NA,OIL FROM COAL.,19
Mr JAMES ,Ha s the Minister for,19
NA,Labour and National Service seen the,19
NA,report that has been submitted to the Joint,19
NA,"Coal Board, and to the New South Wales",19
NA,"Mines Department, by German and English",19
NA,experts on the better utilization of coal and,19
NA,"the possibility of introducing, in the",19
NA,"northern districts in New South Wales, a",19
NA,system similar to that which obtains in the,19
NA,German Ruhr? I do not think that the,19
NA,Minister was in the chamber during the,19
NA,"debate on the Estimates, when 1 mentioned",19
NA,"this matter. We, in the northern districts,",19
NA,are very concerned about the importation,19
NA,of diesel oil. I have not seen the report,19
NA,"in question, but I understand that it suggests",19
NA,that merely by using coal that is not now,19
NA,"in demand for any other purpose, Aus-",19
NA,tralia could obtain a substantial supply of,19
NA,both diesel oil and petrol.,19
Mr HAROLD HOLT , 1 assure the,19
NA,honorable member that I was present in the,19
NA,chamber when he raised this matter during,19
NA,the debate on the Estimates. I have no,19
NA,"doubt that my colleague, the Minister for",19
NA,"National Development, who is the appro-",19
NA,"priate Minister, has been giving considera-",19
NA,tion to the honorable member's remarks on,19
NA,that occasion. The honorable member will,19
NA,"be aware, because I have mentioned it on",19
NA,"many occasions, of the existence of a very",19
NA,"active committee, comprising representa-",19
NA,tives of the Commonwealth and State go-,19
NA,"vernments, the miners' federation, the Joint",19
NA,Coal Board and the Department of Labour,19
NA,"and National Service, which investigates the",19
NA,various problems of the coal industry.,19
NA,"Though I have not read the report, I have",19
NA,no doubt that it has been considered by,19
NA,"the committee, which would seem the",19
NA,appropriate body to examine the possibility,19
NA,of Bsine these methods in Australia.,19
NA,CREDIT FACILITIES FOR PRIMARY,19
NA,INDUSTRY.,19
Mr JEFF BATE ,M y question to the,19
NA,Minister for Primary Industry is supple-,19
NA,mentary to that asked by the honorable,19
NA,member for Lyne. Is it a fact tbat bank,19
NA,returns show a fall in the funds available,19
NA,for agricultural purposes? Is it also a faci,19
NA,that funds flowing into hire-purchase com-,19
NA,panies have resulted in farm equipment,19
NA,being readily available under hire purchase,19
NA,"at interest rates of not 5 i per cent., but up",19
NA,to 20 per cent.? Is it further a fact that,19
NA,the shortage of credit is forcing farmers to,19
NA,"fall back upon their own resources, and",19
NA,causing consequent hardship to theii,19
NA,families? I ask the Minister whethei.,19
NA,"instead of reducing costs, this has the oppo-",19
NA,"site effect of raising them, at a time when",19
NA,Australia's produce must be able to compete,19
NA,with that of other countries in overseas,19
NA,markets.,19
Mr MCMAHON ,Thi s is an incredibly,19
NA,difficult question to answer on the spur of,19
NA,"the moment, and 1 am afraid that it is well",19
NA,beyond my capacity to do so. Neverthe-,19
NA,"less, I will have a detailed answer prepared",19
NA,for the honorable member. I would like,19
NA,to make one comment on the question of,19
NA,credit for rural industries: Though there,19
NA,"was a fall of something like £30,000,000",19
NA,in the total amount of credit available,19
NA,"throughout Australia last year, the per-",19
NA,centage obtained by the primary industries,19
NA,"was as great at 30th June, 1956, as it",19
NA,was at the preceding 30th June. The,19
NA,"primary industries, therefore, are keeping",19
NA,their normal proportion of general credit,19
NA,facilities.,19
NA,ALLEGED ILLEGAL ENTRY OF,19
NA,IMMIGRANTS.,19
Mr HAROLD HOLT ,Higgins-Ministe r,19
NA,for Labour and National Service and,19
NA,Minister for Immigration) -b y leave-,19
NA,"Yesterday, the honorable member for",19
NA,NA,19
NA,a newspaper allegation that immigrants were,19
NA,being illegally admitted into Australia. I,19
NA,said that I would make a report to the,19
NA,Parliament on the matter raised by him,19
NA,at the first opportunity.,19
NA,Allegations have been published in a,19
NA,number of newspapers that there is a wide-,19
NA,spread smuggling ring to get migrants,19
NA,illegally into Australia. These allegations,19
NA,have been based upon newspaper inter-,20
NA,views with an Italian woman described by,20
NA,"the newspapers as "" Carla "", as interpreted",20
NA,NA,20
NA,"were brought to my notice, I stated that the",20
NA,Department of Immigration would make an,20
NA,immediate inquiry into the charges and re-,20
NA,port to me. I have now received this,20
NA,report. It shows that the allegations are,20
NA,without foundation. I table for the infor-,20
NA,mation of honorable members and for the,20
NA,"public, the full text of the report.",20
NA,"Since the report was prepared, I have",20
NA,"considered the case of the woman, called",20
NA,"Carla "" in the newspaper article. As will",20
NA,"be clear from the report, she is an illegal",20
NA,"entrant to Australia, as she deserted the ship country illegally.",20
NA,on which she was employed. She has a,20
NA,husband and three children in Italy. In,20
NA,"all the circumstances, I have decided that",20
NA,<ihe should be required to leave Australia.,20
NA,The woman had been issued with a cer-,20
NA,"tificate of exemption, valid for a period of",20
NA,six months. This is a normal procedure,20
NA,which does not necessarily imply that the,20
NA,person concerned is to be allowed to stay,20
NA,for the full period stated in the certificate.,20
NA,I feel it necessary to emphasize,20
NA,minence has been given by at least one,20
NA,newspaper to the fact of the issue of an,20
NA,"exemption certificate for that period, and",20
NA,it has been taken as signifying that she,20
NA,will be permitted to remain in Australia for,20
NA,atleast that time. This does not follow.,20
NA,I am empowered by the Immigration,20
NA,Act to cancel the certificate of exemption,20
NA,"at any time, and, upon doing so, to issue stances, I move-",20
NA,a deportation order. If certificates were,20
NA,"issued for muchshorter periods, for",20
NA,"example, a week or a month, the necessity",20
NA,would arise in some cases for extension,20
NA,while a passage is being arranged for the,20
NA,"person concerned, or while inquiries are in",20
NA,progress. It is important that certificates,20
NA,should not be allowed to expire because,20
NA,power to deport under the section of the,20
NA,Immigration Act by which they are issued,20
NA,can disappear if the exemption is not kept,20
NA,current. The appropriate action will now,20
NA,be taken to cancel the exemption and to,20
NA,arrange for deportation.,20
NA,It will be evident to honorable members,20
NA,when they read the report of the Departacceptance,20
NA,ment of Immigration that not only is there,20
NA,"no substance in the allegations, but they",20
NA,have been based on information supplied by,20
NA,what can only be regarded on the facts as,20
NA,now known as very unreliable sources.,20
NA,It is to be hoped that the same promin-,20
NA,ence will be given by the press to the facts,20
NA,as they now appear as was given in the,20
NA,first instance to allegations which reflected,20
NA,on the conduct of members of the Vic-,20
NA,torian Police Force and officers of the,20
NA,Department of Immigration. Justice de-,20
NA,mands that it be made abundantly clear,20
NA,that no irregularity of any kind can be attri-,20
NA,"buted to any one of them, nor is there any",20
NA,evidence of an organized racket of migrant,20
NA,"smuggling into this country. We, in Aus-",20
NA,"tralia, can expect attempts to enter this",20
NA,Other countries of,20
NA,"attraction to migrants, such as Canada and",20
NA,"the United States, experience these diffi-",20
NA,"culties also, but the department has its own",20
NA,methods of checking illegal entry and deal-,20
NA,ing promptly and effectively with such cases,20
NA,as occur.,20
NA,I lay on the table the following paper:-,20
NA,Migrants-Allege d Illegal Entry-Departmenta l,20
NA,Report.,20
Dr EVATT ,Wil l the Minister move that,20
NA,"this, as prothe paper be printed?",20
Mr HAROLD HOLT , I have no objec-,20
NA,tion if an opportunity for discussion is,20
NA,desired.,20
Dr EVATT ,I t is quite clear that what,20
NA,the Minister has tabled is a portion of more,20
NA,"extensive documents, and there may be",20
NA,some occasion for comment on it later.,20

NA,INTERNATIONAL WHEAT,20
NA,AGREEMENT BILL 1956.,20
NA,Motion (by Mr MCMahon)-b y leave-,20

NA,That leave be given to bring in a bill to approve,20
NA,by Australia of the International Wheat,20
NA,"Agreement 1956, and for otber purposes.",20
NA,"Bill presented, and read a first time.",20
NA,Second Reading.,21
Mr MCMAHON ,Lowe-Ministe r for,21
NA,Primary Industry) [3.23J -b y leave- I,21
NA,move-,21
NA,That the bill be now read a second tune.,21
NA,The purpose of this bill is to seek the,21
NA,approval of Parliament for the ratification,21
NA,by Australia of the International Wheat,21
NA,Agreement 1956. Honorable members will,21
NA,recall that the first post-war International,21
NA,"Wheat Agreement came into force in 1949,",21
NA,and covered a four-year period up to 31st,21
NA,"July, 1953. That agreement was renewed,",21
NA,"with certain modifications, by the three-year",21
NA,"International Wheat Agreement of 1953,",21
NA,which expired on 31st July of this year.,21
NA,"The 1956 agreement, to which this bill",21
NA,"relates, provides for a further three-yea;",21
NA,"extension, with some amendments, of the",21
NA,arrangements covered by the two earlier,21
NA,agreements. Copies of the new agreement,21
NA,have been distributed to honorable mem-,21
NA,bers for their information and reference.,21
NA,The text of this agreement was negotiated,21
NA,at a special United Nations Wheat Confer-,21
NA,"ence, which met in October-November,",21
NA,"1955, and again during February-April,",21
NA,1956. The entry into force of the agree-,21
NA,ment was made conditional upon it being,21
NA,signed and ratified by governments of coun-,21
NA,tries responsible for a prescribed proportion,21
NA,of the volume of wheat covered by its pro-,21
NA,visions concerning guaranteed purchases,21
NA,"and sales. Following the negotiations, Aus-",21
NA,tralia became a signatory to the new agree-,21
NA,"ment, as did also 39 other countries. How-",21
NA,"ever, signature did not in any final manner",21
NA,commit Australia or any other country to,21
NA,"adherence to the agreement, which is depen-",21
NA,"dent upon the deposit before 1st December,",21
NA,"1956, of a formal instrument of acceptance,",21
NA,"or ratification, in accordance with the con-",21
NA,stitutional or legislative requirements of,21
NA,each individual country. In conformity,21
NA,with the practice followed in respect of the,21
NA,"two earlier agreements, the Government is",21
NA,now seeking parliamentary approval for the,21
NA,lodgment ot an instrument of acceptance,21
NA,to permit Australia's participation in the,21
NA,agreement.,21
NA,"In principle, the new agreement is idenprices",21
NA,"tical with its predecessors, which have",21
NA,operated for seven years. As the arrangeaccount,21
NA,ment is well known to honorable members.,21
NA,"and to Australian wheat-growers, it is, I",21
NA,"believe, unnecessary for me to elaborate on",21
NA,the general nature of the agreement and,21
NA,its historical background. The basic objec-,21
NA,"tives are defined in article I . as being "" to",21
NA,assure supplies of wheat to importing coun-,21
NA,tries and markets for wheat to exporting,21
NA,"countries at equitable and stable prices "".",21
NA,They must be regarded as very worthy,21
NA,objectives in relation to . a commodity,21
NA,"which, in times when no international",21
NA,"scheme operated, was notorious for the",21
NA,violent manner in which its prices fluctuated.,21
NA,The agreement attempts to achieve its,21
NA,objectives by provisions governing both,21
NA,prices and quantities. Maximum and,21
NA,"minimum prices are stated, and transac-",21
NA,tions under the agreement must be within,21
NA,the prescribed price range. For each,21
NA,"importing member country there is a quota,",21
NA,"or "" guaranteed quantity "", which it may be",21
NA,required to purchase at the minimum,21
NA,"price, or which exporting countries may be",21
NA,required to sell to it at the maximum price.,21
NA,"Similarly, for each exporting member",21
NA,country there is a quota which it may be,21
NA,"required to sell at the maximum price, or",21
NA,which importing countries may be required,21
NA,to purchase from it at the minimum price.,21
NA,The experience of the last seven years,21
NA,demonstrates that these arrangements work,21
NA,"satisfactorily in practice, and go a long way",21
NA,towards providing a reasonable degree of,21
NA,stability in the international wheat trade.,21
NA,Although similar to the 1.953 agreement,21
NA,"in principle, the new agreement differs from",21
NA,it in two important points of detail. The,21
NA,first concerns the basic maximum and,21
NA,"minimum prices which, in the new agree-",21
NA,"ment, are 2 dollars and 1.50 dollars respec-",21
NA,"tively, on the basis of No. 1 Manitoba",21
NA,Northern wheat in bulk in store Fort,21
NA,"William/Port Arthur, the main shipping",21
NA,points for Canadian wheat. These basic,21
NA,"prices are 5 cents lower, in each case, than",21
NA,"the prices specified in the 1953 agreement,",21
NA,"reflecting to some extent, but by no means",21
NA,"wholly, the decline which has occurred in",21
NA,wheat prices since the last agreement was,21
NA,negotiated. The new agreement includes,21
NA,the same formulas as did the 1953 Inter-,21
NA,national Wheat Agreement for determining,21
NA,the equivalent maximum and minimum,21
NA,for wheat shipped from other export-,21
NA,ing countries. These formulas take into,21
NA,"differences in transportation costs,",21
NA,the relative qualities of various types of,21
NA,"wheat, and different currencies. The under-",22
NA,lying principle is that wheat sold at the,22
NA,maximum or minimum prices in the,22
NA,difierent exporting countries should be com-,22
NA,"petitive, one with another, in the various",22
NA,"markets, thereby conforming to com-",22
NA,mercial practice. In the case of Australian,22
NA,"f.a.q. wheat, the new maximum price is",22
NA,"equivalent to 18s. a bushel, f.o.b. Aus-",22
NA,tralian ports. The equivalent minimum,22
NA,price for Australian wheat will vary from,22
NA,time to time in accordance with movements,22
NA,"in transportation costs, but on the basis of",22
NA,"current freights is about 12s. a bushel,",22
NA,f.o.b. eastern Australian ports. The figures,22
NA,I have quoted as the equivalent maximum,22
NA,and minimum prices for Australian wheat,22
NA,"are, in each case, subject to such allow-",22
NA,ance as may be agreed between Australia,22
NA,and the importing country concerned to,22
NA,take account of differences in wheat quality.,22
NA,The second point on which the new,22
NA,agreement differs from the last is in respect,22
NA,of membership and guaranteed quantities.,22
NA,"In the 1953 International Wheat Agreement,",22
NA,"44 importing countries participated, and the",22
NA,volume of wheat covered by the importers',22
NA,"quotas amounted to 395,000,000 bushels.",22
NA,"In the new agreement, as negotiated, 44",22
NA,importing countries again submitted figures,22
NA,"for inclusion, but, in many cases, the quotas",22
NA,which they were willing to subscribe were,22
NA,substantially less than their commitments,22
NA,"under the 1953 agreement. In consequence,",22
NA,the total quantity covered by the importers',22
NA,side of the agreement has been reduced by,22
NA,"almost a quarter, to 303,000,000 bushels.",22
NA,"To some extent, those reductions reflect a",22
NA,growing dependence upon domestic produc-,22
NA,"tion, often stimulated by high support",22
NA,"prices. In some cases, too, the quantities",22
NA,for which particular countries were pre-,22
NA,pared to subscribe were undoubtedly in-,22
NA,fluenced by their hopes or expectations of,22
NA,securing wheat outside the agreement under,22
NA,one or another of the United States pro-,22
NA,grammes for the disposal of accumulated,22
NA,wheat stocks.,22
NA,"On the exporting side, the new agree-",22
NA,ment is significantly different. In the first,22
NA,"two International Wheat Agreements, the",22
NA,main exporting member countries were the,22
NA,"United States, Canada, and Australia,",22
NA,"whilst France, though a member, had only",22
NA,"a nominal quota. On this occasion,",22
NA,Argentina and Sweden have joined as ex-,22
NA,"porting members, and France, which since",22
NA,1953 has emerged as a substantial wheat,22
NA,"exporter in normal seasons, is included with",22
NA,a significant quota. The effect of these two,22
NA,changes-th e reduction in a total quantity,22
NA,subscribed by importing countries and the,22
NA,"participation of France, Argentina and",22
NA,Sweden-ha s been a steep reduction in the,22
NA,"quotas available for Australia, Canada and",22
NA,"the United States. In Australia's case, our",22
NA,"quota has been reduced from 45,000,000",22
NA,bushels under the 1953 agreement to,22
NA,"30,000,000 bushels in the new agreement.",22
NA,The figures I have just quoted are those,22
NA,which appear in the text of the agreement,22
NA,"which was negotiated, copies of which have",22
NA,been distributed. I should add that some,22
NA,minor variations from those figures are,22
NA,possible when the agreement is fully in,22
NA,force. I mentioned earlier that each coun-,22
NA,try which has signed the agreement has,22
NA,"until 1st December, 1956, to declare its",22
NA,adherence to the agreement by the deposit,22
NA,of a formal instrument of acceptance.,22
NA,"Accordingly, the final position regarding",22
NA,membership will not be known until that,22
NA,"date, but on the information currently",22
NA,"available it is likely that the changes, if",22
NA,any. which will be necessary will be rela-,22
NA,tively small. Although Australia and a,22
NA,number of other countries which have in-,22
NA,dicated that they intend adhering to the,22
NA,agreement have not yet formally ratified it.,22
NA,the operative provisions concerning prices,22
NA,and quantities came into force on 1st,22
NA,"August, 1956, and transactions are now",22
NA,taking place within the terms of the new,22
NA,agreement.,22
NA,The Government regards the existence of,22
NA,an effective International Wheat Agreement,22
NA,as being of very great value to the Aus-,22
NA,"tralian wheat industry, and to the economy",22
NA,generally. This is particularly the case,22
NA,"in times like the present, when stocks of",22
NA,unsold wheat are at record levels and any-,22
NA,"thing in the nature of "" panic selling "" could",22
NA,bring widespread distress to wheat-growers,22
NA,and sharply reduced export earnings for,22
NA,"Australia. The Government, therefore,",22
NA,through its delegation to the recent con-,22
NA,"ference, pursued every means of obtaining",22
NA,the best possible agreement under which,22
NA,some measure of stability might be given,22
NA,to the export marketing of Australian,22
NA,"wheat. The Government is convinced that,",22
NA,"in the present circumstances, the new",22
NA,agreement is the best obtainable. The new,22
NA,price range cannot be regarded as other,23
NA,"than satisfactory, in the light of current",23
NA,price levels. The quantity of wheat covered,23
NA,"by the new agreement is, admittedly, dis-",23
NA,"appointing, as it represents only about one-",23
NA,third of the wheat entering world trade.,23
NA,The Government would have liked to have,23
NA,seen an agreement with a very much wider,23
NA,"coverage, as the effectiveness of an arrange-",23
NA,"ment of this type is, to some extent at least,",23
NA,influenced by the relationship it bears to,23
NA,total world trade in the particular com-,23
NA,modity.,23
NA,But in considering the alternatives of,23
NA,"having no agreement at all, or of staying",23
NA,out of an agreement which other countries,23
NA,-ou r competitors and our markets-wer e,23
NA,"prepared to implement, the new agreement",23
NA,undoubtedly offers advantages to Australia,23
NA,which far outweigh any reservations asso-,23
NA,ciated with the reduction in quantities. For,23
NA,"example, the formal adherence by such a",23
NA,large and representative group of countries,23
NA,to the basic objective of the agreement,23
NA,offers some prospects that fundamental,23
NA,"wheat problems, such as the stimulation of",23
NA,"uneconomic production, will be kept within",23
NA,"limits. Again, with accumulated wheat",23
NA,stocks so great it is imperative that some,23
NA,degree of orderliness in export marketing,23
NA,should prevail. An international wheat,23
NA,agreement provides the only convenient,23
NA,and effective way of introducing any degree,23
NA,"of orderliness. In connexion with this point,",23
NA,I attach considerable importance to the,23
NA,entry into the agreement of Argentina and,23
NA,"Sweden, and the participation of France on",23
NA,"a substantial basis. And finally, whilst the",23
NA,"agreement is kept in existence, particularly",23
NA,"with Argentina, France and Sweden par-",23
NA,"ticipating, there is always the possibility",23
NA,"that a more satisfactory agreement, em-",23
NA,"bracing wider membership and large quotas,",23
NA,might be negotiated. A complete break-,23
NA,down now would put back the clock by,23
NA,"twenty years, to the time of the chaotic",23
NA,"marketing conditions of the early 1930's,",23
NA,when efforts to find a solution to inter-,23
NA,national wheat marketing problems had,23
NA,their origin.,23
NA,It is for these reasons that the Governr'eveloDmenrs,23
NA,ment is convinced that participation in,23
NA,"new agreement, which is sought by this",23
NA,"would be of undoubted benefit to Ausexample,",23
NA,tralian wheat-growers and to the economy,23
NA,of this country. I wish to make it clear,23
NA,that in reaching its decision in regard to,23
NA,"ratification of the agreement, the Govern-",23
NA,ment has had the advice and the views of,23
NA,"the wheat industry. Indeed, the chairman",23
NA,"of the Australian Wheat Board, and the",23
NA,general president and general secretary of,23
NA,"the Australian Wheat Growers Federation,",23
NA,served as members of the AustraUan dele-,23
NA,gation to the negotiating conference. Those,23
NA,gentlemen are in full accord with the Go-,23
NA,vernment's views on the desirability ot,23
NA,ratification by Australia. I commend the,23
NA,bill to the House.,23

NA,Organizations.,23

NA,Second Reading.,23
Dr DONALD CAMERON ,Oxley-,23
NA,Minister for Health) [3.37] -b y leave- I,23
NA,move-,23
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,23
NA,The object of this bill is to authorize finan,23
NA,cial assistance by the Commonwealth to,23
NA,approved organizations engaged in the con-,23
NA,duct of home-nursing services. The,23
NA,national health service is based on certain,23
NA,principles. One of the most important is,23
NA,the idea of a partnership-o f co-operation,23
NA,between patient and doctor. Implicit in this,23
NA,is the realization that a powerful factor in,23
NA,recovery from illness and restoration to,23
NA,health is the sense of personal responsibility,23
NA,of the patient for what happens to him.,23
NA,This means that the foundation of :.,23
NA,national health scheme should be an efficient,23
NA,and competent general practitioner service,23
NA,The importance of domiciliary medicine can,23
NA,hardly be over-estimated. A hospital ser-,23
NA,vice can never be a true substitute for the,23
NA,"family doctor, whose role is becoming more,",23
NA,"instead of less, important with the recent",23
NA,in medical knowledge. The,23
NA,the modern general practitioner has powerful,23
NA,"bill, weapons in his hands, such things, for",23
NA,as the sulphonamides and the,23
NA,-ntibio'ics. and if his own standard of work,23
NA,"end knowledge is high, can undertake in",23
NA,"ihc home, r.nd ia full and proper collabora-",24
NA,"tion with the specialist, a great deal of",24
NA,ireatmem to the great benefit of his patients,24
NA,"in particular, and the country in general.",24
NA,Much is said nowadays about the ques-,24
NA,"lion of medical and hospital benefits, and",24
NA,all sorts of claims are made that these,24
NA,should be higher or more extensive. Whether,24
NA,"this is so or not, the thing of fundamental",24
NA,"importance is the quality of medical care,",24
NA,and it is essential that there must be not,24
NA,only no deterioration of the standard of,24
NA,family and general practice from the high,24
NA,"level at which it has existed in the past,",24
NA,hut that this standard should be main-,24
NA,"lined and, if possible, raised.",24
NA,"if this is so, then several things are",24
NA,sary. Not only is there need for good train-,24
NA,"ing of general practitioners, but the condi-",24
NA,tions of general practice must be such as to,24
NA,give scope to men who possess good train-,24
NA,"ins, and ability, and be designed to allow",24
NA,their patients to benefit from it to the full.,24
NA,This means in modern medical practice that,24
NA,"trained assistance, by a complementary",24
NA,"service, namely the nursing profession,",24
NA,should be available.,24
NA,For more than 50 years home nursing care,24
NA,has been provided for the poor and needy,24
NA,throughout Australia by district and bush,24
NA,nursing associations and religious organiza-,24
NA,tions. Honorable members will be familiar,24
NA,with the charitable and public-spirited work,24
NA,of these bodies whose efforts have brought,24
NA,"relief to the sick and aged, particularly in",24
NA,the poorer areas of the cities. The nurses,24
NA,employed by these home-nursing organiza-,24
NA,tions are generally known in Australia as,24
NA,""" district "" nurses. The special feature of",24
NA,iheir work is that it is carried out by visits,24
NA,io the homes of the patients as distinct from,24
NA,"hospital, clinic, or institutional care, or the",24
NA,services rendered by a nurse engaged pri-,24
NA,vately by the patient.,24
NA,The district nurses are generally referred,24
NA,"to the patients, in the first instance, by a",24
NA,hospital or by a local doctor. The majority,24
NA,of patients nursed are those with long-term,24
NA,illnesses such as patients suffering from,24
NA,"cardiac disease, arthritis, incurable carci-",24
NA,"noma, and so on. Many of these patients",24
NA,ure very ill and would be transferred to,24
NA,hospitals or other institutions but for thc,24
NA,serious shortage of hospital beds. The,24
NA,nursing these patients require is mainly,24
NA,"general care, sponging, supervision, and",24
NA,general nursing treatment which is always,24
NA,"arduous and time-consuming, though there",24
NA,are many cases which do not require more,24
NA,"than a daily visit, or perhaps a visit several",24
NA,times a week.,24
NA,Although chronic illnesses are prevalent,24
NA,"among all age groups, they mainly affect",24
NA,people over 60 years of age. It is these,24
NA,people that make up the majority of the,24
NA,district nurses' patients. It is estimated,24
NA,that approximately three-quarters of the,24
NA,patients of each district nursing association,24
NA,are chronically ill and over the age of 60,24
NA,years. A considerable amount of home-,24
NA,nursing work is also done for patients,24
NA,who cannot be classified as chronically ill.,24
NA,"necesbut who require prolonged care, such as",24
NA,those requiring after-care for unhealed,24
NA,wounds following operations. At the same,24
NA,"time, under modern conditions, an increas-",24
NA,ing number of acute cases is becoming suit-,24
NA,able for treatment at home.,24
NA,"Since the war, it has been impossible for",24
NA,hospital construction to be maintained at a,24
NA,rate in any way commensurate with the,24
NA,"growth in population. Consequently, it has",24
NA,become necessary for surgical and acutely,24
NA,ill cases to be discharged from hospital at,24
NA,"the earliest possible time, whilst the chroni-",24
NA,cally and less acutely ill have found it pro-,24
NA,gressively more difficult to obtain hospital,24
NA,accommodation at all. Many of these,24
NA,"chronically ill people, who in other days",24
NA,"would have been hospital cases, cannot now",24
NA,receive the nursing attention they require,24
NA,unless they are visited by the district nurses.,24
NA,Because of this oppressive shortage of hos-,24
NA,"pital beds, the need for adequate properly",24
NA,equipped home-nursing services has greatly,24
NA,intensified in recent years.,24
NA,"At the present time, some 150 district",24
NA,nurses are employed by home-nursing asso-,24
NA,ciations. A work analysis recently made,24
NA,indicates that each of these 150 nurses is,24
NA,at present saving the provision of six hospi-,24
NA,"tal beds; that is, the home-nursing services",24
NA,are saving 900 hospital beds throughout,24
NA,Australia. The capital cost of providing,24
NA,new hospital accommodation has risen to,24
NA,extraordinary heights. In the case of hos-,24
NA,"pitals recently completed, the cost is",24
NA,"reckoned at at least £7,000 a bed. The cost",24
NA,of maintaining a hospital bed has also,24
NA,reached a new and very high level. It is,24
NA,"now rarely, if ever, less than £3 a day, and",24
NA,in the case of many individual hospitals,24
NA,is considerably more than that. By way of,25
NA,"contrast, the cost of a visit to a home by a",25
NA,district nurse averages something like 7s.,25
NA,These figures give some indication of the,25
NA,savings of very great significance to the,25
NA,community that are to be made by encour-,25
NA,"aging home-nursing for the sick, instead of",25
NA,"hospitalization, whenever it is possible. It",25
NA,has been reliably estimated that the main-,25
NA,tenance of 150 nurses in district nursing,25
NA,work keeps hospital running costs down by,25
NA,"at least £1,000,000 a year. The total cost",25
NA,of keeping these 150 nurses in the field is,25
NA,less than one-fifth of that sum.,25
NA,Can I give the House a further example?,25
NA,If in a few years' time home-nursing were,25
NA,to expand to four times its present level,25
NA,"there would be, on these considerations, a",25
NA,"saving of 3,600 beds, resulting in the fol-",25
NA,lowing financial savings:-,25
NA,Annual maintenance expenditure,25
NA,relating to these beds . . ..,25
NA,"A capital expenditure, assuming they",25
NA,"were all provided, of well over 20,000,000",25
NA,The cost of home-nursing services to pro-,25
NA,duce such a result would be very small,25
NA,"indeed. These are, of course, theoretical",25
NA,"figures, but they indicate the magnitude of",25
NA,the financial relief which could be afforded,25
NA,"to the general problem of hospital costs,",25
NA,in an expanding population.,25
NA,"These, in brief, are thefinancialand prac-",25
NA,tical considerations in favour of the develop-,25
NA,ment of home-nursing services. At the,25
NA,"same time it is realized that many patients,",25
NA,"particularly old people, will be much",25
NA,"happier and perhaps will be better, if they",25
NA,"can be nursed at home, and modern medical",25
NA,"thought favours this practice. Furthermore,",25
NA,"it is now realized that the visiting nurse,",25
NA,can do much effective work in the field of,25
NA,"preventive medicine, giving instruction in",25
NA,"general health, nutrition, food habits, &c.",25
NA,It is advantages of this kind which Aus-,25
NA,tralian and overseas authorities are now,25
NA,coming to recognize in the practice of send-,25
NA,"ing the nurse into the home, instead of",25
NA,sending the patient into hospital. In view,25
NA,"of these developments, the Government",25
NA,recently decided that the building up of,25
NA,numerically stronger and better equipped,25
NA,organizations of district nurses should bz,25
NA,"encouraged, so far as it is practicable for",25
NA,the Commonwealth to do so. The volun-,25
NA,tary organizations already in the field have,25
NA,done splendid work. They have kept their,25
NA,services going when times were difficult,25
NA,and have accepted heavy financial burdens,25
NA,in an effort to expand their services in,25
NA,recent times to keep pace with growing,25
NA,"public demands. We, therefore, believe",25
NA,that the most promising approach to the,25
NA,expansion of home-nursing services is to,25
NA,provide financial assistance for public and,25
NA,religious organizations qualified to perform,25
NA,this work. As the Commonwealth is enter-,25
NA,"ing this field for the first time, we felt ti",25
NA,inadvisable to specify in this bill precise,25
NA,terms and conditions on which Common-,25
NA,wealth financial assistance will be made,25
NA,available. These matters will be determined,25
NA,according to circumstances affecting par-,25
NA,"ticular organizations and, perhaps, varied",25
NA,from time to time in the light of experience.,25
NA,"In general terms, the Commonwealth's",25
NA,£ policy will be to grant to non-profit making,25
NA,home-nursing organizations now in the field,25
NA,"4,000,000",25
NA,subsidies approximating the salaries paid to,25
NA,nursing sisters employed by them over and,25
NA,above the number ordinarily employed dur-,25
NA,ing the year prior to the commencement,25
NA,"of the act. Thus, if an organization has",25
NA,"ordinarily employed, say, ten nurses dur-",25
NA,ing the past year and increases its staff,25
NA,!o twelve nurses when this scheme com-,25
NA,"mences, it will receive a subsidy approximat-",25
NA,ing the salary of the two additional nurses:,25
NA,if it increases its staff to fifteen nurses It,25
NA,will receive a subsidy approximating the,25
NA,salarv of the five additional nurses. This,25
NA,basis for calculating the subsidy will be,25
NA,applied in relation to the organizations,25
NA,which are conducting home-nursing services,25
NA,"at the present time. It is possible, ot course,",25
NA,lhat new organizations will enter the field.,25
NA,It will be evident to honorable members,25
NA,that it will not be practicable to subsidize,25
NA,"these "" new"" organizations on exactly the",25
NA,same basis as that proposed for the exist-,25
NA,"ing organizations, because that would in-",25
NA,volve the payment of a Commonwealth,25
NA,subsidy equal to the full salary of even,25
NA,"nurse employed by each "" new "" organiza-",25
NA,"tion. This would put "" new "" organizations",25
NA,on a much more favorable basis than thosi-,25
NA,that have pioneered this field. It is pro-,25
NA,"posed, therefore, that the organizations",25
NA,which commence home-nursin? services,25
NA,after this act comes into operation will be,25
NA,entitled to apply for a subsidv equal to,25
NA,approximately half the salarv paid to each,25
NA,nurse employed on home-nursing duty.,26
NA,"This, I think, is a fair and equitable basis",26
NA,for handling this problem.,26
NA,"Up to the present, finance for the district",26
NA,nursing associations' work has come mainly,26
NA,"from State government subsidies, collections",26
NA,"from patients, and donations by the public.",26
NA,We think il right that money should con-,26
NA,tinue to be supplied to the associations from,26
NA,these sources. The work of the district,26
NA,nurses results in a significant saving in,26
NA,"State hospital expenditure, and the States,",26
NA,"as I have pointed out already, support",26
NA,organizations engaged in this work. This,26
NA,bill provides that the subsidy to be paid by,26
NA,ihe Commonwealth is not in any case to,26
NA,exceed the State government subsidy.,26
NA,Naturally it is proposed to consult with the,26
NA,State governments about the effective carry-,26
NA,ing out of the provisions of the bill. The,26
NA,Minister's approval will be required before,26
NA,an organization is granted a subsidy under,26
NA,this scheme. The organizations which arc-,26
NA,"granted subsidies will, of course, have lo",26
NA,supply the Director-General of Health with,26
NA,adequate information and properly audited,26
NA,"accounts and reports. For example, the",26
NA,Director-General of Health will in all cases,26
NA,have to be satisfied that the nurses on,26
NA,account of whom the subsidy is claimed are,26
NA,properly qualified. At the same time. 1,26
NA,assure Ihe House that the department will,26
NA,not be seeking to impose conditions or,26
NA,restrictions which will hamper the organi-,26
NA,sations in their conduct of their work.,26
NA,There will be no attempt by the Govern-,26
NA,ment to interfere with the organizations',26
NA,"management and control of their affairs,",26
NA,except insofar as is consistent with thc,26
NA,proper expenditure of public funds. 1,26
NA,believe that this measure will prove to be,26
NA,of very great importance and value in the,26
NA,"field of public health. I , therefore, hope",26
NA,that all members will be sympathetic to its,26
NA,objectives and will accord it their full,26
NA,support.,26

Mr JEFF BATE ,Macarthur) [3.51] -,26
NA,When considering the proposed vote for the,26
NA,"Department of Defence Production, one",26
NA,"thinks of the making of ammunition, and",26
NA,one may be forgiven for recalling those,26
NA,days in 1944 and 1945 when Australian,26
NA,"troops, already emerging into an atomic",26
NA,age because an atomic bomb was used in,26
NA,"1945 to end the war, were in the jungle",26
NA,wrestling with the problems relating to the,26
NA,supply of ammunition for their weapons.,26
NA,"I can remember, and I suppose many",26
NA,"other honorable members can remember,",26
NA,"too, endeavouring to get ammunition",26
NA,through the jungle up to the troops in the,26
NA,from line.,26
NA,Mr Dean -Dry .,26
Mr JEFF BATE ,An d to get it there,26
NA,"dry, as the honorable member for Robert-",26
NA,son says. The .303 ammunition was still,26
NA,being packed in a steel container of a type,26
NA,"which was introduced, I suppose, in World",26
NA,"War I . , 30 years earlier. The containers",26
NA,"held 1,248 rounds, and it was impossible to",26
NA,carry them on the jungle trails. The con-,26
NA,tainers had to be opened and the ammuni-,26
NA,tion transferred in small quantities to sand-,26
NA,"bags, which became wet, and so the troops",26
NA,were forced to carry with them wet rounds,26
NA,"which they could not trust. Further, they",26
NA,carried not only .303 ammunition but also,26
NA,"9-mm. and 7-mm. ammunition, rounds for",26
NA,"the various machine guns, belts for the",26
NA,"Vickers, magazines for the Brens, mortar",26
NA,"bombs of all types, rounds for artillery",26
NA,"pieces, and so on. This situation led to",26
NA,"a lowering of morale in the troops, and",26
NA,great difficulties in the supply lines both for,26
NA,ourselves and for the Americans at whose,26
NA,side and on whose side we were fighting.,26
NA,All sorts of difficulties were encountered in,26
NA,"bringing the ammunition to the islands, and",26
NA,taking it from the ports or beaches into,26
NA,the jungle and from the jungle bases to,26
NA,the front line. The problems encountered,26
NA,were almost incredibly difficult. From this,26
NA,state of affairs the ideal of having one size,26
NA,of ammunition to suit all the western,26
NA,nations was conceived. We now have an,26
NA,"agreement, I believe, that the FN .30 rifle,",27
NA,"which is a semi-automatic carbine similar,",27
NA,"I think, to the American carbine, will be",27
NA,standard equipment and that all armies at,27
NA,the side of which we are likely to fight,27
NA,use common ammunition. I f we are,27
NA,forced to fight on the side of other troops,27
NA,"or alone, it will be a boon indeed to have",27
NA,the .30 rifle in use. The agreement to,27
NA,which I have referred was made some years,27
NA,ago. The need for it was apparent many,27
NA,"years ago, when the honorable member for",27
NA,Adelaide ( Mr Chambers) was Minister for,27
NA,the Army. It was apparent to me as a very,27
NA,"lowly officer, and I made a report about it.",27
NA,I do not know whether the report ever,27
NA,reached the honorable gentleman; probably,27
NA,it was stopped at some low level. The,27
NA,report referred to the dangers of having old,27
NA,types of ammunition packages. Whereas,27
NA,the Japanese were carrying light packages,27
NA,"wrapped in tarred paper, which enabled",27
NA,mortar bombs and other ammunition to be,27
NA,"kept dry and in good condition for years,",27
NA,we were still being supplied with steel,27
NA,packages of ammunition which were not,27
NA,suitable for that type of warfare. The,27
NA,"point I am making is that, in spite of the",27
NA,need which then existed and which now,27
NA,"exists, we have not yet reached the",27
NA,stage of manufacturing .30 ammunition.,27
NA,Perhaps the Minister for Defence Pro-,27
NA,duction ( Sir Eric Harrison) will correct,27
NA,"me if I am wrong, but I believe",27
NA,that we are still making .303 ammu-,27
NA,nition for the .303 rifles that are used for,27
NA,training and rifle practice. Stocks of such,27
NA,ammunition have to be maintained for use,27
NA,"in this rifle which, I think, was used 40",27
NA,years ago in World War I . I make that,27
NA,observation because I want to refer to a,27
NA,term that is being commonly used to-day-,27
NA,the inflexibility of defence preparations.,27
NA,Although this Parliament has been thinking,27
NA,"in terms of nuclear warfare, radar, and",27
NA,"guided missiles, which seek out enemy air-",27
NA,"craft, we still go on with the inflexible",27
NA,preparations which are a legacy to us from,27
NA,previous military regimes. The defence,27
NA,chiefs are still forced to make recommenda-,27
NA,tions which carry on the manufacture of,27
NA,the kind of ammunition that is being pro-,27
NA,duced at Maribyrnong.,27
NA,We are not concerned merely with,27
NA,"manufacture of practice rounds, or even",27
NA,with the manufacture of rounds for the,27
NA,"FN .30 rifle, with which, I understand,",27
NA,Australian Army will soon be equipped.,27
NA,Because the use of infantry is essential to,27
NA,"the defence of this country, we must con-",27
NA,tinue to manufacture rounds for small,27
NA,"will arms, but whilst we carry on with these",27
NA,"inflexible defence preparations, we also art-",27
NA,obliged to find ammunition for new,27
NA,"weapons, such as those used in aircraft,",27
NA,tank guns and mortars. Under the Seato,27
NA,treaty we have obligations to the other mem-,27
NA,"ber nations. We have obligations, too, to",27
NA,"Great Britain, which some of us thought",27
NA,we might have to honour in connexion with,27
NA,"the Suez Canal situation. Then, we have",27
NA,obligations to America. This Government,27
NA,has made defence arrangements with other,27
NA,nations which I think those who sit on the,27
NA,other side of the Parliament also would have,27
NA,made had they been in power. The Go-,27
NA,vernment has embarked on defence pre-,27
NA,parations in accordance with the arrange-,27
NA,ments made with Australia's allies for,27
NA,mutual security. We have spent,27
NA,"£190,000,000 a year on defence. We have",27
NA,"all kinds of military weapons, and we must",27
NA,have ammunition for those weapons.,27
NA,The Minister for the Army ( Mr.,27
NA,Cramer) referred to the use of Centurion,27
NA,tanks. Suppose that we had Centurion,27
NA,tanks but no ammunition for them. Think,27
NA,what would happen if there were no hand,27
NA,"grenades, no mortar bombs, no bombs for",27
NA,aircraft and no means of providing war,27
NA,"heads, propellant charges, fuses, and so on.",27
NA,All of those things are essential to defence,27
NA,"preparations. For that reason, the factory",27
NA,at Salisbury is being used by the long-range,27
NA,"weapons organization, and the factory at",27
NA,"Maribyrnong is producing small arms, but",27
NA,because we had no factories which could,27
NA,supply us with the other very necessary,27
NA,"items of military equipment, such as bombs,",27
NA,"mines, shells, propellant charges, war heads",27
NA,"for shells and fuses, it became imperative,",27
NA,in order that we might be capable of,27
NA,"honouring our obligations to our allies, to",27
NA,construct the ammunition filling factory at,27
NA,St. Mary's. It has been argued that there,27
NA,"is no need for that factory, but, obviously,",27
NA,"if we are to have defence preparations, we",27
NA,must have ammunition. Not only must,27
NA,"ammunition be in the storage magazines,",27
NA,but also we must have a plant which is,27
NA,the capable of producing newly developed,27
NA,"munitions at short notice, and by the most",27
NA,"modern processes, including automation. If.",27
NA,"the at any moment, we are attacked and have",27
NA,"to defend ourselves, we shall be able to",28
NA,depend upon the factory at St. Mary's to,28
NA,the ammunition that is needed.,28
NA,"Many of us found ourselves, in the early",28
NA,".part of the war, in the situation where we",28
NA,"""had arms but no ammunition. I remember",28
NA,an episode that occurred after Mr.,28
NA,Churchill had sent practically all of his,28
NA,-materiel to the Middle East. England was,28
NA,"under threat of attack across the channel,",28
NA,and a tank colonel ordered the mobilization,28
NA,of his tanks to try to save England from,28
NA,invasion. The quartermaster reported to,28
NA,"him that there were no rounds available,",28
NA,">to which the colonel replied, "" Get the",28
NA,"rounds""! The quartermaster thereupon",28
NA,-produced wooden rounds for the defence,28
NA,"of Great Britain! There are, in this Par-",28
NA,"liament, people who never want to see a",28
NA,"recurrence of those events, nor do they",28
NA,want to see thousands of young Australian,28
NA,men offering to defend their country but,28
NA,having no ammunition with which to do it.,28
NA,It is the duty of this Parliament to make,28
NA,sure that there are adequate supplies of,28
NA,-munitions.,28
NA,Because the Minister for Defence Pro-,28
NA,duction may not speak again in the Parlia-,28
NA,"ment after to-day, I wish to take this",28
NA,tunity to congratulate him on his deter-,28
NA,mination to give Australia and its defence,28
NA,"-forces adequate supplies of ammunition,",28
NA,"although in doing so he has been attacked,",28
NA,f publicly congratulate him for his part in,28
NA,the establishment of the factory at St.,28
NA,Mary's. There was a need for the factory;,28
NA,"the Minister knew that the need existed,",28
NA,and he went ahead with the project. In my,28
NA,"-opinion, the need for the St. Mary's plant",28
NA,"has already been established, and I think",28
NA,that the Parliament and the country should,28
NA,"..acknowledge the fact, although to do so",28
NA,may not be popular with certain sections,28
NA,-of the press which have attacked the pro-,28
NA,-fect with utter irresponsibility.,28
NA,Since the need for the factory at St.,28
NA,"Mary's has been established, let us look at",28
NA,"the methods used to establish it, which,",28
NA,"'perhaps, have been, in part, the reason for",28
NA,the attack. The factory was to be con-,28
NA,structed on a new method known as a cost,28
NA,"-plus fixed fee contract, or a negotiated",28
NA,tract. A firm named Stephenson and,28
NA,Turner was selected as the supervising,28
NA,"-architects, which was a most unusual course,",28
NA,"vi had an opportunity, some time ago, to",28
NA,"see some of the staff of this firm, and 1",28
NA,must say that I have never seen a better,28
NA,group of men. The designing and super-,28
NA,"vision of the factory, therefore, was placed",28
NA,in the hands of a very fine organization.,28
NA,"In addition, Utah Australia Limited and",28
NA,"Concrete Constructions Proprietary Limited,",28
NA,"war which obtained the fixed fee contract, have",28
NA,made a great difference to construction,28
NA,methods in this country. If honorable,28
NA,"members care to go to St. Mary's, they will",28
NA,see that the work is not being carried out,28
NA,by the government stroke. I have never,28
NA,"seen men work so hard. Naturally, some",28
NA,criticism will arise in connexion with such,28
NA,"a vast and complex organization, and, of",28
NA,"course, extraordinary things are happening,",28
NA,but the men are working hard and are,28
NA,very proud of the organization for which,28
NA,they are working. They are also proud,28
NA,of the modern machinery that they have,28
NA,been given.,28
NA,1 remind the committee that work on,28
NA,"the Eildon weir project in Victoria, whicb",28
NA,was being constructed by government day-,28
NA,"labour, at one stage went dead slow and",28
NA,then stopped. Utah Australia Limited,28
NA,came on the scene and did the job thai,28
NA,opporthe government stroke had failed to do.,28
NA,The company was paid a management fee of,28
NA,"£10,000 a day to complete the job within",28
NA,a certain time. It did the job in three,28
NA,months less than the specified time and lost,28
NA,"the fee of £10,000 a day for that period.",28
NA,"It believes that honesty pays, which is",28
NA,"unusual in contracts of this kind, and",28
NA,thought that it might get more work in,28
NA,Australia by such a policy. I am delighted,28
NA,to see the St. Mary's project going ahead.,28
NA,The construction methods are proving,28
NA,themselves. I do not wish to anticipate the,28
NA,"Minister's remarks, but I think it is fair",28
NA,to say that reports indicate that the job,28
NA,"will be finished on time, and that, in",28
NA,"December, 1957, we shall have, at St.",28
NA,"Mary's, a modern and splendid plant of",28
NA,which every Australian may be proud.,28
Mr EJ HARRINSON ,Blaxland),28
NA,[4.5] -i n addition to the section of the,28
NA,Estimates just dealt with by the honorable,28
NA,"conmember for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate),",28
NA,the committee has before it a section deal-,28
NA,ing with funds for the Department of,28
NA,"Supply, and it is to this section that I wish",28
NA,to direct my remarks. Members of the,28
NA,"Opposition feel that in these days, when",29
NA,nuclear weapons such as hydrogen and,29
NA,"cobalt bombs are being manufactured, a",29
NA,"pertinent question is: "" How long will the",29
NA,mad rush for world power and destruction,29
NA,"continue, and where will it end? "". Mem-",29
NA,bers of the Opposition recognize that nuc-,29
NA,"lear energy is a great gift to mankind, and",29
NA,that it is now being investigated by the,29
NA,"scientists. Undeniably, advantage is to be",29
NA,"gained from nuclear power for this nation,",29
NA,mainly because of the high cost of produc-,29
NA,ing power from coal and the limits of,29
NA,hydro-electric power in Australia.,29
NA,"On 6th August last, honorable members",29
NA,were astonished to read in the daily,29
NA,"particularly in the "" Sydney Morning",29
NA,"Herald "", a report of severe cuts in federal",29
NA,expenditure on nuclear weapons. It was,29
NA,obvious that such a cut must have a severe,29
NA,effect on a nation seeking means of using,29
NA,nuclear energy to assist in its development.,29
NA,I shall first read the report that appeared,29
NA,"the "" Daily Telegraph"" on 6th August",29
NA,"under the headings, "" Big money cuts-",29
NA,"Almost all nuclear works stops "". It is",29
NA,follows:-,29
NA,Severe cuts in federal expendiiure have almost,29
NA,stopped work on Australia's atomic energy,29
NA,programme.,29
NA,The Nuclear Research Foundation's,29
NA,( Mr R. G. C. Parry-Oakdcn) last night said he,29
NA,understood lhat the cuts had stopped work.,29
NA,The report adds-,29
NA,"Nucleus, the journal of the Atomic Energy",29
NA,"Commission, refers editorially, in its current",29
NA,"io the effects of the cms-""Th e Australian",29
NA,atomic energy programmes have suffered a further,29
NA,"setback-i n fact, it has practically drawn to a",29
NA,"stop. Funds for the project, which",29
NA,"a yearly basis, have been cui, with the consequent",29
NA,"-losing down of most of the building programme "".",29
NA,The report further states-,29
NA,This tragic turn of affairs is difficult to under-,29
NA,stand in face of ever-increasing activity in this,29
NA,field by all other forward-looking nations.,29
NA,A later paragraph reads-,29
NA,It is widely felt that many responsible Australians,29
NA,have not taken the trouble to acquaint themselves,29
NA,"-a s their counterparts in England, America,",29
NA,Canada and olher countries have-wil h even the,29
NA,rudiments of the peaceful application of nuclear,29
NA,energy. Only Australia can be the loser in,29
NA,instance.,29
NA,"The "" Daily Telegraph "" report went o n -",29
NA,"The "" Daily Telegraph "" telephoned Mr.",29
NA,at 9.30 p.m.,29
NA,"We presume, from the report, that that is",29
NA,the Minister for Supply ( Mr Beale). It,29
NA,continued-,29
NA,A woman who answered the telephone said,29
NA,Mr Beale was asleep and she would not awaken,29
NA,him.,29
NA,Mr Beale -Tha t woman happened to be,29
NA,my wife.,29
Mr EJ HARRINSON , I am not,29
NA,saying anything detrimental about the,29
NA,Minister's wife. I am only reading what,29
NA,the report contains-tha t she said the,29
NA,Minister was asleep and she would not wake,29
NA,him. My only comment is that the Minis-,29
NA,"ter for Supply is still asleep, particularly",29
NA,"press, with regard to nuclear development.",29
NA,Mr Beale - I rise to order. I do not,29
NA,like lo interrupt the honorable member for,29
NA,"Blaxland, who has dragged in the "" Daily",29
NA,"Telegraph"", a newspaper that has been",29
NA,conducting a campaign against me on this,29
NA,"matter for a long time. However, the",29
NA,in honorable member will have to deal with,29
NA,"this matter at another time, because the",29
NA,committee is now discussing the Estimates,29
NA,as for the Department of Supply. These do,29
NA,not relate to the Atomic Energy Commis-,29
NA,"sion, which was discussed last week. I",29
NA,suggest that the honorable member might,29
NA,"bring this matter up at some other time,",29
NA,chairman but not to-day.,29
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Adermann) -,29
NA,Order! There is some substance in the,29
NA,"point taken by the Minister, but I have",29
NA,been listening carefully to the honorable,29
NA,issue member. What he has been saying is asso-,29
NA,ciated with defence services and I am pre-,29
NA,"pared to allow him to continue, but he",29
NA,are voted on must keep to the point.,29
Mr EJ HARRINSON , I have no,29
NA,intention of going outside the proper bounds,29
NA,of this discussion. As a consequence of,29
NA,"the Minister still being asleep, danger is",29
NA,developing in Australia as a result of atomic,29
NA,tests at the Woomera Rocket Range and,29
NA,elsewhere. I direct the attention of honor-,29
NA,able members again to the statement con-,29
NA,"tained in the editorial of "" Nucleus "" which",29
NA,points out that we are still concerned-an d,29
NA,unless the Minister is still asleep he should,29
NA,be also concerned-wit h the development,29
NA,this of atomic power in Australia for peaceful,29
NA,purposes more than for any other purpose.,29
NA,Mr Beale -Rubbish ! The Estimates for,29
NA,Beale the Atomic Energy Commission have been,29
NA,doubled this year.,29
Mr EJ HARRINSON ,Th e,30
NA,Minister will have his opportunity to reply.,30
NA,"In May last, a nuclear weapon was tested",30
NA,at Monte Bello. I assume that the Minister,30
NA,"was not asleep on that occasion, but was",30
NA,interested in what was happening. Conse-,30
NA,"quently, 1 direct his attention to press re-",30
NA,"ports of the event, and I will not quote the",30
NA,""" Daily Telegraph "", since the Minister has",30
NA,the impression that that newspaper is,30
NA,antagonistic to him. Possibly all the press,30
NA,of Australia will be against him if he goes,30
NA,"to sleep over this matter. On 25th May,",30
NA,"the "" Sydney Morning Herald "" published",30
NA,the following report of what happened after,30
NA,the Monte Bello tests:-,30
NA,"Scientists went ashore on Tremoville Island,",30
NA,"the Monte BeJlos, a few hours after Britain's",30
NA,"atomic device was exploded there last Wednesday,",30
NA,Professor L. H. Martin said yesterday.,30
NA,It goes on to say something about Professor,30
NA,"Martin, and then reports the remarks",30
NA,"another member of the committee, the chief",30
NA,of the Commonwealth Meteorological,30
NA,"Bureau, Mr L . J. Dwyer, in these terms-",30
NA,The whole of the radio-active cloud was dis-,30
NA,sipated over the Indian Ocean.,30
NA,""" None of it drifted anywhere near the",30
NA,"land "", he said. There was no cause to fear",30
NA,cattle or other animals on the mainland,30
NA,affected by radio-activity.,30
NA,Mr Dwyer said also-,30
NA,The meteorologists in the parly checked and,30
NA,rc-chcrVed thf weather conditions up to the last,30
NA,"possible moment during, the morning of the tests.",30
NA,Their forecasts of 36 hours previously were ex-,30
NA,tremely accurate.,30
NA,"Dealing with radio-active cloud, he said",30
NA,that it was dissipated over the Indian Ocean.,30
NA,In the same report one further comment,30
NA,was made. It is this-,30
NA,The higher an atomic weapon is exploded from,30
NA,the ground the less debris is sucked up by,30
NA,"explosion, thus minimizing the radio-active",30
NA,out.,30
NA,"On Thursday, 27th September last, another",30
NA,atomic test was made. Honorable members,30
NA,will recall that it was intended to make,30
NA,"test on about l l t h September, but day",30
NA,day the winds were not in the right direction,30
NA,and the press begun to make comments,30
NA,which may have irked the Minister. Newsthat,30
NA,papers began to ask what kind of wind,30
NA,scientists responsible for these tests really,30
NA,"wanted. That was understandable, in view",30
NA,of the great care that was taken in conpress,30
NA,nexion with the Monte Bello tests last May. the test?,30
NA,The scientists and all those concerned were,30
NA,so sure that if the wind was in the right,30
NA,direction all the radio-active material would,30
NA,"be carried harmlessly away, and that if the",30
NA,bomb were exploded at a great height from,30
NA,the ground no radio-active fallout would,30
NA,settle on the land and everything would be,30
NA,"right, as it was at Monte Bello. But what",30
NA,are the facts?,30
NA,Mr Beale -Th e honorable member does,30
NA,not know.,30
Mr EJ HARRINSON ,Tha t is,30
NA,because the Minister has not made a repori,30
NA,to Parliament about this test. On the day,30
NA,that the test was made no instruction was,30
NA,in issued about the grounding of aeroplanes in,30
NA,"latest the area, and the bomb was exploded at",30
NA,5 o'clock in the afternoon-no t in the,30
NA,"morning, as was originally intended.",30
NA,Immediately afterwards-an d these facts,30
NA,of must surely be known to the Minister- a,30
NA,cloud came directly over New South Wales,30
NA,"and southern Queensland at 10,000 feet.",30
NA,"On the following day, 28th September, in-",30
NA,structions were issued for the grounding,30
NA,of all aeroplanes in a vast area bounded,30
NA,mainby a line running from just north of Dubbo,30
NA,"that to Cunnamulla, in Queensland, and over",30
NA,would be into South Australia.,30
NA,Mr Beale -No t a single aeroplane was,30
NA,grounded in Australia following the last,30
NA,test.,30
Mr EJ HARRINSON ,Instruc -,30
NA,tions were issued that aircraft were noi,30
NA,to fly over the area.,30
NA,Mr Anderson -Rea d the instruction.,30
Mr EJ HARRINSON ,Tha t N,30
NA,"what we are asking for. The Minister ha -,",30
NA,to answer to the people of Australia for this.,30
NA,the The point I am making is that in May we,30
NA,fallwere told it was necessary that the tesi,30
NA,should be conducted in such a way that,30
NA,all the fallout would go over the sea. 1,30
NA,know many of the western parts of New-,30
NA,"this South Wales, and I am entitled to know",30
NA,"after why, if such precautions were necessary",30
NA,"in May, the people who live north of Dubbo",30
NA,were not accorded the same precautions,30
NA,were observed at Monte Bello. Was it,30
NA,the because some of the organizations under,30
NA,the control of the Minister got a bit ruffled,30
NA,"or, shall we say, a bit panicky following",30
NA,criticism of the delay in conducting,30
NA,Mr Beale -Doe s the honorable member,31
NA,"realize that Monte Bello is 2,000 or 3,000",31
NA,miles from Maralinga?,31
Mr EJ HARRINSON , I realize,31
NA,"that, but if there was need for care in",31
NA,keeping the fallout away from the mainland,31
NA,"on the occasion of the Monte Bello test,",31
NA,there is greater need for keeping it away,31
NA,from the people who live in Dubbo and just,31
NA,north of that town. If the testing of atom,31
NA,"bombs in central Australia is to continue,",31
NA,we want to know what is to be the policy,31
NA,"of the Government, the Minister, or the",31
NA,persons who are in charge of these tests.,31
NA,"We want to know whether, irrespective of",31
NA,rhe fact that the wind might take the fall-,31
NA,"out across New South Wales, future tests",31
NA,ure to be conducted at 5 p.m. or at some,31
NA,other selected time as late as sixteen dayr.,31
NA,:ifter the original time set. Tt is possible,31
NA,that the kind of wind that was blowing,31
NA,on the evening of 27th September was also,31
NA,blowing on more than one occasion between,31
NA,11 th September and that date.,31
NA,This committee and the country are,31
NA,titled to know from the Minister for Supply,31
NA,during this debate all the facts of the matter.,31
NA,We are entitled to know why. aircraft were,31
NA,prevented from flying over this vast area,31
NA,"on the following day, all the instructions",31
NA,"that were issued, and why the fallout",31
NA,this test was different from that of the,31
NA,Monte Bello test when it was ensured that,31
NA,ihe fallout would not pass over the mainrun a message.,31
NA,land. We know the Minister is in the,31
NA,""" second eleven ""; but it might be that he",31
NA,would only get the job of tallying the,31
NA,"scores. However, the question",31
NA,out over Australia should be treated in a,31
NA,different manner from that in which thc,31
NA,Minister is treating it.,31
Sir ERIC HARRISON ,Wentworth-,31
NA,Vice-President of the Executive Council,31
NA,Minister for Defence Production) [4.20] -,31
NA,I am sorry that I am cutting across the,31
NA,"debate that has developed, but I feel",31
NA,"the Minister for Supply ( Mr Beale),",31
NA,"he rises in his place, will be able to",31
NA,adequately with the honorable member for,31
NA,Blaxland ( Mr E. James Harrison). Perwanted,31
NA,haps the delay will make the position much,31
NA,"better, because it will enable the Minister",31
NA,to cool down following the unwarranted,31
NA,charges and foolish statements that were,31
NA,made by the honorable member for Blax-,31
NA,land and which were enough to rouse the-,31
NA,ire of any man.,31
NA,The Estimates for the Department ol,31
NA,Defence Production have been increased',31
NA,"this year. In 1955-56, the department's,",31
NA,"expenditure was approximately £12,300,000.",31
NA,The proposed vote for 1956-57 has risen-,31
NA,"by approximately £7,500,000, of which",31
NA,"£6,500,000 will be expended on the new",31
NA,ammunition filling factory at St. Mary's.,31
NA,"I do not wish to deal with the St. Mary's,",31
NA,"factory this afternoon, but to refer to the",31
NA,achievement of the Department of Defence-,31
NA,"Production. However, I should like to say",31
NA,"in passing, as the honorable member for",31
NA,"Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) has said, thai",31
NA,there would be no defence programme in,31
NA,this country if we did not make arrange-,31
NA,ments for the production of the wherewithal,31
NA,to give effect to such a programme. Asso-,31
NA,ciated with every war as far back as history,31
NA,"can be traced, and in which arms and",31
NA,"ammunition have been held and used, there",31
NA,has been a scandal over a shortage of,31
NA,enmunitions. When I assumed the portfolio-,31
NA,of Defence Production I made up my mind,31
NA,"that, if T were to continue to occupy it, 1'",31
NA,must ensure that Australia would not be,31
NA,faced with a shortage of munitions in a time,31
NA,of crisis. The factory at St. Mary's has-,31
NA,from been designed for that purpose.,31
NA,Mr Curtin -Th e Minister could not,31
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,31
NA,able member for Kingsford-Smith had better,31

Sir ERIC HARRISON ,I t will one o»,31
NA,the most up-to-date filling factories in the,31
NA,"world, and will include automatic filling",31
NA,machinery from Meissner of Germany and,31
NA,also of the British Department of,31
NA,and Supply research establishment. We combed-,31
NA,the world in order to obtain the,31
NA,most up-to-date automatic filling machinery..,31
NA,"that Recently the "" Sydney Morning Herald""",31
NA,when sent a reporter to report on the,31
NA,deal St. Mary's project because there had,31
NA,been criticism of it and that organization,31
NA,to assure itself that things were,31
NA,running smoothly. It will be remembered',31
NA,that there had been criticism of the number,31
NA,of houses that had been built at St. Mary's-,31
NA,"to house the staff. The department, in",31
NA,"the first instance, and later the Auditor-",32
NA,"General, directed the attention of the con-",32
NA,tractors to the cost of those buildings. The,32
NA,construction of these houses forms part,32
NA,"-of the complete scheme, so, if they",32
NA,have cost a little more at the begin-,32
NA,"ning, what we lose on the swings we will",32
NA,pick up later on the roundabout. The fact,32
NA,that this plant will be completed within the,32
NA,scheduled time and for the estimated cost,32
NA,is an indication of the progress that is,32
NA,being made. The reporter who went to,32
NA,"St. Mary's concluded his article, which",32
NA,"appeared in the "" Sydney Morning Herald """,32
NA,"..of 9th September, by saying-",32
NA,lt seemed that if we really need a new muni-,32
NA,tions filling factory at St. Mary's we are getting one,32
NA,in a hurry and the rapidity of its completion might,32
NA,make its cost compare favourably with other big,32
NA,"projects notwithstanding the £6,000-£8,500 staff",32
NA,cottages.,32
NA,"So, the reporter who went out to criti-",32
NA,"cize remained to praise, and he was firmly",32
NA,convinced that we were going really well,32
NA,with the establishment of this factory. I,32
NA,have spoken about St. Mary's at great length,32
NA,"in this chamber in the past, and I do not",32
NA,intend to say anything more about it now.,32
NA,Because of the general criticism that has,32
NA,been levelled against the defence Estimates,32
NA,by Opposition members and by persons out-,32
NA,"side this chamber, the picture that has",32
NA,already been painted by the Minister for,32
NA,Defence ( Sir Philip MCBride) and the Minis-,32
NA,ters in charge of the various defence ser-,32
NA,"vices would not be complete if I , as Minis-",32
NA,"ter for Defence Production, did not place",32
NA,before this committee and the country,32
NA,what has been achieved by the Department,32
NA,of Defence Production over the last five,32
NA,"years. Therefore, I wish to set out the",32
NA,functions of the department and what it,32
NA,"stands for, and also to deal with the various",32
NA,factories that come within the administration,32
NA,"of the department, such as ordnance, air-",32
NA,"craft, munitions, filling, explosives and the",32
NA,like. The main production functions of the,32
NA,"department cover munitions, explosives,",32
NA,"ordnance, aircraft and small arms. It is",32
NA,also responsible for arranging production,32
NA,in industry generally in annexes and by,32
NA,major and general contractors.,32
NA,The committee will realize that the func-,32
NA,"tions of this department are many, and that",32
NA,"the department itself has very, very wide",32
NA,'ramifications indeed. The department has,32
NA,"an employment figure of some 13,000",32
NA,persons in four States of the Common-,32
NA,"wealth-11,00 0 in the government factories",32
NA,"and 2,000 engaged on general administra-",32
NA,"tive work, stores, &c. It recruits and trains",32
NA,"its own apprentices and professional cadets,",32
NA,and thereby establishes a nucleus of highly,32
NA,skilled production executives capable of,32
NA,expansion and integration in any emer-,32
NA,gency. It controls assets with a replace-,32
NA,"ment cost of more than £100,000,000. I",32
NA,ask the committee just to consider that par-,32
NA,"ticular matter for a moment, because this",32
NA,department is really big business. Last,32
NA,year it was responsible for production,32
NA,"valued at £34,000,000, which together with",32
NA,the department's own votes accounts for,32
NA,approximately one-quarter of the total,32
NA,defence allocation. It operates twelve fac-,32
NA,tories as well as ancillary services such,32
NA,"as the flight test airfield at Avalon, central",32
NA,"stores, drawing offices, maintenance units",32
NA,and synthetic ammonia plants. It produces,32
NA,equipment varying from clockwork fuse,32
NA,"mechanisms to 3,600 horse-power marine",32
NA,diesel engines. If honorable members have,32
NA,ever studied the intricacies of the fuse sys-,32
NA,tems and compared the fine tolerances in-,32
NA,volved with the tolerances associated with,32
NA,"a 3,600 horse-power marine diesel engine,",32
NA,they will get some idea of the great range,32
NA,"of skilled technical knowledge, technicians",32
NA,and skilled artisans that we have in our,32
NA,employ. We can produce articles from air-,32
NA,craft to munitions and we can produce and,32
NA,maintain ordnance varying from the infan-,32
NA,tryman's rifle to the biggest guns in use in,32
NA,the Royal Australian Navy.,32
NA,The department co-operates with indus-,32
NA,"try in production, and naturally we estab-",32
NA,lish industrial annexes and provide indus-,32
NA,try with know-how so that-we can call upon,32
NA,industry and expand rapidly in case of,32
NA,"crisis. Last year, we arranged for the",32
NA,manufacture of goods in industry to a,32
NA,"value of £17,000,000. Let me now give the",32
NA,committee some idea of the typical produc-,32
NA,"tion of the department in the last five years,",32
NA,because it is over that period that we have,32
NA,"been subjected to criticism, and over that",32
NA,period that the Opposition and the press,32
NA,have stated that we have spent large sums,32
NA,of money but have got very little in return,32
NA,for that expenditure. Let us have a look,32
NA,at the production of munitions and explo-,32
NA,sives for a start.,32
NA,We have produced approximately,33
NA,"100,000,000 rounds of small arms ammuni-",33
NA,"tion, more than 3,000,000 shell cases of",33
NA,"various calibres, approximately 1,250,000",33
NA,"percussion, time, mechanical, and electronic",33
NA,fuses and primers-produce d to the excep-,33
NA,tional standards of accuracy and tolerance,33
NA,that I mentioned before. We have pro-,33
NA,"duced more than 100,000 3-in. rockets,",33
NA,manufactured or reconditioned for the,33
NA,Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal,33
NA,Australian Navy. We have produced,33
NA,"almost 2,000,000 20-mm. cartridges, filled",33
NA,and packed. We have also produced,33
NA,"500,000 40-mm. cartridges, 34,000 4-in.",33
NA,"cartridges, 28,000 4.5-in. cartridges and",33
NA,"manufactured 6,000 25-pounder cartridges.",33
NA,"We have manufactured 78,000 bodies of",33
NA,hand grenades and assembled and filled,33
NA,them. We have manufactured special pro-,33
NA,pellants for rockets and boosts made for,33
NA,the long-range weapons research establish-,33
NA,"ment, including filling for more than 2,000",33
NA,"5-in. rockets. We have produced 200,000",33
NA,aircraft engine starting cartridges and,33
NA,"approximately 1,250,000 cartridges for use",33
NA,with 3-in. rockets. We have made nearly,33
NA,"200,000 rounds of military pyrotechnic and",33
NA,signal stores of various types. Apart from,33
NA,"rockets and cordite, we have produced",33
NA,approximately 850 tons of cordite pro-,33
NA,"pellant, and more than 2,800 short tons of",33
NA,cannon and rifle powder for the Australian,33
NA,services and Nato- I remind honorable,33
NA,members that we are required to supply,33
NA,certain items to Nato.,33
NA,"May I now turn to aircraft, because when",33
NA,we take into consideration that we have the,33
NA,De Haviland factory and the establishments,33
NA,of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corpora-,33
NA,"tion Proprietary Limited, which require conhave",33
NA,tractual obligations to be carried out by,33
NA,with capital equipment and materials sup-,33
NA,plied by us. it will give an indication,33
NA,the Department of Defence Production,33
NA,comesinto the picture of these other air-,33
NA,craft establishments outside the Govern-,33
NA,ment aircraft factories in a very big way.,33
NA,"Bearing all that in mind, I inform honor-",33
NA,"able members that we have, in this period,",33
NA,produced twelve Lincoln four-engine heavy,33
NA,"hombers at the Government aircraft factory,",33
NA,52 Vampire jetfightersat De Haviland Air-,33
NA,"craft Company Proprietary Limited, 41",33
NA,"Vampire jet trainers at the same company,",33
NA,29 Winjeel propellor trainers at the,33
NA,Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Pro-,33
NA,prietary Limited. Ninety-one radio-con-,33
NA,trolled target aircraft have been designed,33
NA,and produced by the Government aircraft,33
NA,"factory, and 34 Canberra jet bombers",33
NA,turned out at the same establishment.,33
NA,Forty-four Sabre jet fighters have been,33
NA,delivered by the Commonwealth Aircrafi,33
NA,Corporation Proprietary Limited to the,33
NA,Royal Australian Air Force. There are,33
NA,fourteen Sabre jets at present at Avalon.,33
NA,and two at the factory of the Common-,33
NA,wealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary,33
NA,Limited ready to go to Avalon. Those at,33
NA,Avalon are awaiting test flights so that it,33
NA,may be said that there are fourteen ai,33
NA,Avalon and two with the Commonwealth-,33
NA,"Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited,",33
NA,making a total of 60 Sabre jet aircraft so,33
NA,far produced.,33
NA,We have also produced 70 Nene jet,33
NA,"engines for the Vampire fighters, and 78",33
NA,Avon jet engines for the Canberra bombers,33
NA,and for fighters. These have been pro-,33
NA,duced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Cor-,33
NA,poration Proprietary Limited. In the five-,33
NA,year period we have overhauled and serviced,33
NA,"a total of 742 airframes, 2,088 engines and",33
NA,"155,000 ancillary aircraft equipment units.",33
NA,Also in thatfive-yearperiod we have deli-,33
NA,"vered to the services 123,100 different items",33
NA,"of aircraft spare parts, as they have been",33
NA,required.,33
NA,"Now I shall turn to ordnance, because we",33
NA,heard the honorable member for Bendigo,33
NA,( Mr Clarey) make some observations about,33
NA,that matter last night. We have produced,33
NA,ten 4.5-in. naval gun mountings on revolv-,33
NA,"ing platforms, and there are nine under",33
NA,construction. These units weigh approxi-,33
NA,"mately 80 tons each, so the committee will",33
NA,some idea of the extraordinary size of,33
NA,us the undertakings of our ordnance factories.,33
NA,There are 170 120-mm. recoilless anti-tank,33
NA,"thai guns in the course of production, and",33
NA,initial deliveries have commenced. Foui,33
NA,main gearing sets for anti-submarine fri-,33
NA,"gates and destroyers have been completed,",33
NA,and seven more are under construction,33
NA,A gear case weighs about 40 tons. Fourteen,33
NA,40-mm. naval anti-aircraft guns with pre-,33
NA,"dictors have been completed, and five are",33
NA,in the course of production. Five 21-in.,33
NA,torpedo tubes and mountings have been,33
NA,"completed and two are under construction,",33
NA,as well as other secret types of naval arma-,33
NA,ments. We have converted 121 40-mm.,33
NA,oaval anti-aircraft guns from manual opera-,34
NA,tion to power operation. Ordnance equip-,34
NA,ment for 25-lb. and 3.7-in. guns has been,34
NA,"repaired in industry to a value of £122,500.",34
NA,Let me turn to small arms. The honor-,34
NA,able member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti),34
NA,will be interested in the figures showing the,34
NA,activities of the Small Arms Factory at Lith-,34
NA,"gow. In recent years, the factory has been",34
NA,mainly occupied with the repair and recon-,34
NA,ditioning of small arms weapons rather,34
NA,than with new production. As the commit-,34
NA,"tee knows, the factory is tooling up for",34
NA,production of the FN rifle. Recent opera-,34
NA,tions include the repair and conditioning,34
NA,"of 102,000 .303-in. rifles, 32,220 light",34
NA,machine guns and sub-machine guns of,34
NA,"various types, 23,250 pistols and 60,000",34
NA,"bayonets and scabbards, as well as anti-",34
NA,"tank infantry weapons, mortars and spare",34
NA,parts for weapons.,34
NA,"ln addition, we have gone in for what",34
NA,can be called miscellaneous production. Ir,34
NA,is interesting to note that the production,34
NA,of Doxford-type marine engines has been,34
NA,developed for the first time in Australia at,34
NA,the marine engine works at Port Mel-,34
NA,"bourne. Seven of these engines, each of",34
NA,"which develops over 3,000 horse-power",34
NA,"and weighs 270 tons, have been completed",34
NA,"for the Australian Shipbuilding Board, for",34
NA,"installation in bulk cargo carriers, and four",34
NA,more are in the course of production. Over,34
NA,"1,250,000 ball bearings have been produced",34
NA,at Echuca in the last five years. At the,34
NA,"department's synthetic ammonia plants, re-",34
NA,serve capacity has been occupied in pro-,34
NA,"ducing 220,000 tons of ammonium sul-",34
NA,phate for fertilizers-representin g approxi-,34
NA,"mately 40 per cent, of Australian produc-",34
NA,tion; over 18.000 tons of methanol for,34
NA,the plastics industry-th e total Australian,34
NA,production; and over 11.000 tons of,34
NA,ammonium nitrate for both fertilizers and,34
NA,"civil explosives. Approximately 2,000",34
NA,"spherical naval buoys and 2,500 marine",34
NA,markers have been produced in industry,34
NA,through the department. Boom defence,34
NA,"equipment, including anti-submarine and",34
NA,"anti-torpedo nets, to the value of £160 000",34
NA,has been produced in industry. Over,34
NA,"1,200 mobile transceivers have been made",34
NA,"in industry for the Army, as well as",34
NA,approximately 500 walkie-talkie sets for,34
NA,sonal use in the field. Pontoons have been,34
NA,repaired in industry to the value of,34
NA,"£93,000.",34
NA,"In addition to these examples, which are",34
NA,"by no means exhaustive, the department has",34
NA,consistently followed a policy of develop-,34
NA,ing or auuing to production. capacity with,34
NA,a view to meeting the requirements of the,34
NA,nation in an emergency. It recognizes thai,34
NA,in such an emergency we should need to,34
NA,rely on the developing structure of Aus-,34
NA,"tralian secondary industry. Therefore, ii",34
NA,places developmental orders and works in,34
NA,close harmony with industry advisory com-,34
NA,mittees. Almost one-half of the,34
NA,"£34,000,000 worth of production arranged",34
NA,by the department in 1955-56 was under-,34
NA,taken in industry-mainl y the aircrafi,34
NA,industry.,34
NA,Let me turn to capital facilities. As I,34
NA,"have mentioned previously, there have been",34
NA,developments also in the establishment of,34
NA,such facilities. During the period from,34
NA,1951 to 1955 moneys available to thc,34
NA,department for new capital expenditurc,34
NA,"averaged approximately £2,800,000 a year",34
NA,"With those financial resources, new facili-",34
NA,ties have been developed. They include a,34
NA,new test airfield at Avalon. This is,34
NA,essential for the testing of jet aircraft. The,34
NA,largest jet aircraft at present in production,34
NA,can take off from and land at Avalon air-,34
NA,field. We have established Avon engine,34
NA,production capacity in Australia. We have,34
NA,established a plant for the production ot,34
NA,"picrite, the new flashless propellani",34
NA,that is so. necessary in modern warfare.,34
NA,Other new facilities include a plant for the,34
NA,"manufacture of RDX, a powerful high",34
NA,explosive entirely new to conventional war-,34
NA,fare; a specialized plant for tool room use:,34
NA,production capacity for new type fuses; and,34
NA,additions and modifications to existing go-,34
NA,vernment munitions and aircraft establish-,34
NA,ments.,34
NA,It might be as well if I told the com-,34
NA,"mittee that the department, in addition to",34
NA,supplying the wants of the Australian,34
NA,"services, has been seeking orders Irom over-",34
NA,seas. We are in consultation with New-,34
NA,"Zealand in connexion with aircraft, and",34
NA,we are arranging to sell to Sweden a num-,34
NA,"ber of Jindiviks. The Jindivik, as honor-",34
NA,"able members know, is a pilotless aircraft",34
NA,-almos t a guided missile. Earlier this,34
NA,"per- year, a delegation from the Royal Swedish",34
NA,Air Board visited Australia and examined,34
NA,the Jindivik then in production at the,34
NA,"government aircraft factories, with a view",34
NA,to purchase. The department has now,35
NA,received a telecablegram from its London,35
NA,"representative to the effect that he, in turn,",35
NA,has received a telegram from the Royal,35
NA,Swedish Air Board stating that the Swedes,35
NA,"are prepared to order ten Jindiviks, and",35
NA,that a detailed letter will follow. Major,35
NA,"Silven, who was a member of the Swedish",35
NA,"mission to Australia, and who is now in",35
NA,"London, has informed the departmental",35
NA,"representative there that the purchase order,",35
NA,"with a detailed letter, will be issued before",35
NA,16th October. Major Silven has also,35
NA,informed the departmental representative,35
NA,that a public announcement has been made,35
NA,in Sweden that the Swedish Government,35
NA,is proposing to order Australian Jindiviks.,35
NA,"The total value of the order, including",35
NA,"ground equipment, supply and technical",35
NA,"data, camera pods, &c, is approximately",35
NA,"£500,000, of which the British content is",35
NA,"approximately £190,000. This is a mag-",35
NA,nificent tribute to the design engineers at,35
NA,"the government aircraft factories, as well as",35
NA,to the production team which has been,35
NA,responsible for the manufacture of the air-,35
NA,craft and the installation of complex,35
NA,guidance equipment.,35
NA,"From time to time, members of the",35
NA,Opposition seek a reduction of the votes,35
NA,for the defence departments. They say,35
NA,that the Government is spending too much,35
NA,money on defence and that we are not,35
NA,getting value for our money. They urge,35
NA,"that defence expenditure be reduced. But,",35
NA,"apparently, they fail to realize that if the",35
NA,"vote for a service department is reduced,",35
NA,that department will reduce the number,35
NA,of orders that it places with government,35
NA,"defence factories, with the result that some",35
NA,of the men employed in those factories,35
NA,"will be dismissed, because there is no work",35
NA,"available for them. When that happens,",35
NA,there is a tremendous howl from the mem-,35
NA,bers of the Opposition. They say that we,35
NA,"must keep the men in employment, but",35
NA,they seek to deny to us the money necessary,35
NA,to do so. They cannot have it both ways.,35
NA,If they want us to reduce expenditure on,35
NA,"defence, they must accept the consequences",35
NA,"of such a reduction. Therefore, I want to",35
NA,say something about employment. Total,35
NA,employment in government defence fac-,35
NA,"tories has risen from 8,000 persons between",35
NA,"1946 and 1949, to 11,000 persons now.",35
NA,That is a very high peace-time employment,35
NA,"figure for such factories. However, the",35
NA,work load on munitions and aircraft fac-,35
NA,tories is of a cyclical nature. The manufac-,35
NA,"ture of the Canberra bomber, the 4.5-in..",35
NA,"twin mountings, the S.T.A.A.G. mountings-",35
NA,and the torpedo tube mountings for,35
NA,"destroyers, the modification of Lincoln:",35
NA,"aircraft, the servicing of Merlin engines, the",35
NA,"manufacture of .303 rifles, are typical",35
NA,manufacturing projects coming to an end-,35
NA,In some instances replacement projects-',35
NA,"have been selected, for example the F.N..",35
NA,"rifle. In other cases, for example the new",35
NA,"types of naval ordnance, the replacement",35
NA,"project is, for the time being, somewhat un-",35
NA,certain. The so-called sophisticated weapons,35
NA,-guide d weapons-ar e in advanced experi-,35
NA,"mental and design stages but, in the main;",35
NA,they are not ready for operational use. The,35
NA,Government and the services are exercising,35
NA,caution before embarking on new produc-,35
NA,tion programmes in the ordnance and air-,35
NA,"craft factories. Consequently, there must",35
NA,be some immediate retrenchment in the,35
NA,various government munitions and aircraft,35
NA,establishments. This is a period of con-,35
NA,solidation. The work force in the Govern-,35
NA,ment defence production establishments,35
NA,"will, therefore, for the time being, be cut",35
NA,back roughly to the level that obtained,35
NA,when the Government took office. The,35
NA,first batch of notices of dismissals will be,35
NA,"given next Friday. I want only to say, in",35
NA,"conclusion, that these men who will be",35
NA,given their notices of dismissal are,35
NA,not necessarily going to remain out,35
NA,of employment. As the Minister,35
NA,for Labour and National Service ( Mr.,35
NA,"Harold Holt) has pointed out, this is.",35
NA,a transfer of labour from government muni-,35
NA,"tions factories to private industry, which",35
NA,wants these men. We have already had,35
NA,"recently, in our ordnance factories, cases of",35
NA,approximately 80 men who have handed i n,35
NA,their resignations and obtained new jobs.,35
NA,Mr Chambers -Ho w many will be dis-,35
NA,missed?,35
Sir ERIC HARRISON , I cannot give,35
NA,the honorable gentleman the actual figure,35
NA,"at present, because we are still working or>",35
NA,"it, but I have given an approximate figure",35
NA,snowing an eventual decrease in employ-,35
NA,"ment from 11,000, to 8,000. We will even-",35
NA,"tually bring the figure back, unless some-",35
NA,"thing very unforeseen happens, to approxi-",35
NA,"mately the figure when we took office, but",35
NA,that will be over a period.,35
Dr EVATT ,Wil l the figure go below,36
NA,"8,000?",36
Sir ERIC HARRISON ,"No , it will not",36
NA,"go below 8,000, and the reduction will be",36
NA,"spread over a period of years, and will not",36
NA,be made immediately. I want to make it,36
NA,perfectly clear to the committee that unless,36
NA,"we can get orders, which presupposes that",36
NA,"unless money is available to the services,",36
NA,we cannot continue to keep this extra-,36
NA,ordinarily large peace-time work force in,36
NA,operation. The Government's term of office,36
NA,has been an exceptional period in which we,36
NA,have had to remedy all the deficiencies and,36
NA,shortages with which we were faced as a,36
NA,result of the Labour Government's neglect,36
NA,during its period of office. We had to,36
NA,bring the government factories back to a,36
NA,"productive level, and bring back the ser-",36
NA,"vices to a proper equipment standard, be-",36
NA,cause Labour had failed to do the job when,36
NA,it was in power. That fact necessitated our,36
NA,stepping up our work force to the extent,36
NA,to which we did step it up. Now we have,36
NA,established the desired position and we have,36
NA,given the services the equipment they want.,36
NA,"They have their reserves, and we are now in",36
NA,a. position in which we can consolidate,36
NA,that which we have started. I think that,36
NA,the committee will certainly come to the,36
NA,"conclusion, if it looks at these figures and",36
NA,"digests the facts about the great work done,",36
NA,"the skilled work done, that the Department",36
NA,of Defence Production has given a £l's,36
NA,"value for every £1 spent, and has honorably",36
NA,"discharged the responsibility placed on it,",36
NA,"and done its duty, during the whole term of",36
NA,office of this Government.,36
Dr EVATT ,Barton-Leade r of the,36
NA,Opposition) [4.50] - I wish to refer to the,36
NA,"subject of nuclear experiments, but, before",36
NA,"I do so, I must advert to the statements",36
NA,made by the Minister for Defence Produc-,36
NA,tion ( Sir Eric Harrison). Once again the,36
NA,right honorable gentleman seeks to blame,36
NA,Labour. 1 tbink that the best test to apply,36
NA,to him is the test invited by the Minister,36
NA,Defence ( Sir Philip MCBride) who. the,36
NA,"other night, said that Mr Curtin was quite",36
NA,aware of the defence position prior to the,36
NA,assumption of office of the Curtin Govern-,36
NA,ment. In answer to the remarks of the,36
NA,Minister for Defence Production about,36
NA,Labour's alleged responsibility for de-,36
NA,ficiencies when the present Government,36
NA,"took office, 1 shall quote from a speech",36
NA,"made by Mr Curtin on 26th July, 1943,",36
NA,and I should like the attention of the,36
NA,"Minister for Defence Production, who is",36
NA,leaving us in the very near future.,36
NA,Sir Eric Harrison - I am not leaving thr,36
NA,chamber. I am waiting to hear what the,36
NA,Leader of the Opposition has to say.,36
Dr EVATT ,I n the speech from which,36
NA,I am about to read Mr Curtin was referring,36
NA,to the anti-Labour governments of which,36
NA,the present Minister for Defence Produc-,36
NA,tion was a member. This is how Mr Curtin,36
NA,characterized those governments^-,36
NA,"Blind to the dangers in the Pacific, the Menzies",36
NA,and Fadden Governments had left Australia very,36
NA,much unprepared.,36
NA,He was referring to the anti-Labour go-,36
NA,vernments that had been in office up to the,36
NA,"end of 1941, when anti-Labour governments",36
NA,"had been in office for ten years, with",36
NA,"majorities in both Houses of the Parliament,",36
NA,and had had complete responsibility for the,36
NA,defence of this country. Mr Curtin con-,36
NA,tinued- .,36
NA,Australia's resources were spread over many,36
NA,far-flung battle fronts. The men of the three-,36
NA,services fought with fine efficiency and made,36
NA,"conspicuous contributions, but at home the then",36
NA,government had left the country almost un-,36
NA,"defended. Australia was a sector as menaced, and",36
NA,"as helpless, as the Philippines.",36
NA,Then he goes into the details. When I heard,36
NA,the statements made this afternoon by thc,36
NA,Minister for Defence Production I was,36
NA,reminded of the facts. Mr Curtin gave,36
NA,the figures regarding the actual defence,36
NA,equipment available when the Labour go-,36
NA,vernment came into office at the end of,36
NA,1941. I am sure that the Minister for,36
NA,Defence Production will be interested in-,36
NA,this. The equipment to which Mr Curtin,36
NA,was referring was the total initial equip-,36
NA,ment. He said that Army equipment,36
NA,related to initial requirements was available,36
NA,in Australia in the following percentages:-,36
NA,"Rifles, 20 per cent.; sub-machine guns, 28",36
NA,"for per cent.; light machine guns, 41 per cent.;",36
NA,"anti-tank rifles, 15 per cent.; anti-tank guns.",36
NA,"21 per cent.; anti-aircraft guns, 9 per cent.;",36
NA,"field guns, 56 per cent. He said also thar",36
NA,there was then in Australia not one fightet,36
NA,aircraft. Austraiia had only trainer air-,36
NA,craft available at that time. He said thai,36
NA,Air Force strength in 1941 was only 44,36
NA,"per cent, of what it was at the time he was",36
NA,"making his speech in July, 1943. He also",36
NA,"said that, when Labour took office, Aus-",37
NA,tralia had only ten light tanks available for,37
NA,"its defence, but that at the time he was",37
NA,speaking light and medium tanks were a,37
NA,four figure total.,37
NA,I shall not go into the details of Mr.,37
NA,Curtin's devastating criticism of the pre-,37
NA,"ceding anti-Labour governments, but I am",37
NA,surprised that members of the governmenl,37
NA,immediately preceding the Curtin Labour,37
NA,Government can hold their heads up and,37
NA,dare to criticize Labour. Do not forget that,37
NA,"the period, to which the Minister for",37
NA,Defence Production has referred was the,37
NA,three-year period beginning,37
NA,post-war year. That was the period of,37
NA,rehabilitation of returned servicemen.,37
NA,"Certainly, there was a reduction in the",37
NA,"strength of the services in that year, because",37
NA,"the war had been successfully concluded,",37
NA,"but there were 8,000 people in employ-",37
NA,ment in those government defence factories,37
NA,even then. What the Government pro-,37
NA,poses to do now is to go back to that,37
NA,"employment level of 8,000, the level, I",37
NA,"stress, in the first year after the successful",37
NA,"conclusion of the war, despite the fact that",37
NA,"the Minister himself said, in 1951, that we",37
NA,faced war within twelve months. The,37
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) had been,37
NA,"satisfied with predicting war in three years,",37
NA,"but the Minister, who had been for some",37
NA,"time in London, prophesied war in twelve",37
NA,months.,37
NA,Sir Eric Harrison - I did not say that.,37
Dr EVATT ,Yo u did make such a,37
NA,statement.,37
NA,I apologize to the committee for having,37
NA,taken up its time in making these state-,37
NA,"ments, but I was forced to reply to the",37
NA,accusations made by the Minister. 1 desire,37
NA,"now to turn, briefly, to the main subject",37
NA,"that I wish to discuss, which is our position",37
NA,in relation to nuclear experiments. I shall,37
NA,conclude my remarks on that matter by,37
NA,moving that the first item in the group of,37
NA,"departments before the committee, namely,",37
NA,the proposed vote for the Department of,37
NA,"Supply, be reduced by. £1. The Opposi-",37
NA,tion's view of nuclear weapons has been,37
NA,expressed by the decisions reached at the,37
NA,Hobart conference of the party. That view,37
NA,aims at high-level political talks to achieve,37
NA,effective prevention of the use of atomic,37
NA,"and hydrogen bombs by any nation, whether",37
NA,for purposes of war or experimental pur-,37
NA,poses. Nearly every proposal made at,37
NA,"that conference has since been given effect,",37
NA,including those concerned with making,37
NA,membership of the United Nations prac-,37
NA,"tically universal, making arrangements for",37
NA,"better relationships with Asian countries,",37
NA,and matters of that kind. Our proposals in,37
NA,relation to nuclear weapons also are coming,37
NA,to pass. We advocated their immediate sus-,37
NA,"pension approximately two years ago, and it",37
NA,is now advocated by the British Labour,37
NA,movement.,37
NA,Mr Beale -Th e British Labour party did,37
NA,"in 1946, the first not say that.",37
Dr EVATT ,"Yes , it did.",37
NA,Mr Beale -I t did not. I have before me,37
NA,the motion that was put to the conference.,37
Dr EVATT ,Th e Minister will have the,37
NA,opportunity to speak later. Thc British,37
NA,Labour movement favours the suspension of,37
NA,atomic experiments.,37
NA,Mr Beale -No t unilaterally.,37
Dr EVATT , I am not dealing with the,37
NA,matter from the unilateral stand-point. I am,37
NA,dealing with it from the stand-point of our,37
NA,proposal for immediate high-level talks for,37
NA,the purpose of suspending atomic experi-,37
NA,ments.,37
NA,"Mr Wilkie, a very well-known writer",37
NA,on this subject for one of the Melbourne,37
NA,"newspapers, takes very much the same view",37
NA,as Dr Russo. He points out that we are,37
NA,"near the point "" at which the peoples of",37
NA,the world will insist on putting an end to,37
NA,further nuclear test explosions-A-bom b,37
NA,"and H-bomb "". He points out also that to",37
NA,say that two years ago would have been re-,37
NA,garded as equivalent to heresy. But that,37
NA,has now been taken up by the British,37
NA,Labour movement. It is also the policy of,37
NA,the Democratic party in the United States,37
NA,of America. Mr Wilkie points out that last,37
NA,November Russia indicated its readiness to,37
NA,ban all further atomic tests by agreement,37
NA,"between the Big Three, and on 17th July",37
NA,last the Russian Foreign Minister repeated,37
NA,that offer. The United Kingdom Prime,37
NA,Minister said very much the same thing after,37
NA,the summit talks. That is the policy of,37
NA,"Mr Adlai Stevenson, the leader of the",37
NA,"Democratic party in the United States, and",37
NA,"also of the President of the United States,",37
NA,provided that security against breaches of,37
NA,an arrangement can be obtained. I think,37
NA,"it is obvious-an d this, too, is pointed",38
NA,Mr Wilkie-tha t no nation can set off a,38
NA,nuclear explosion in any part of the world,38
NA,which cannot be detected elsewhere by,38
NA,appropriate instruments. So whatever atomic,38
NA,happens in Russia is immediately known in altogether.,38
NA,"the United States, and, 1 suppose, vice",38
NA,versa.,38
NA,We feel that the time has come for,38
NA,tralia to act. Russia says it is willing,38
NA,enter into a firm agreement. The United,38
NA,Kingdom Government apparently takes the,38
NA,"same view, and, subject to the same safejected",38
NA,"guards, so does the United States of",38
NA,America. But nothing is happening. The,38
NA,experiments are continuing. When will,38
NA,"end? Will they end of their own accord,",38
NA,"or will they end, as they should, by agreeThat",38
NA,ment? I think the duty of the Australian,38
NA,Government is to take the initiative in these context.,38
NA,matters. Australian territory is being used,38
NA,as the experiment ground for other,38
NA,tries. Therefore it is in our interests to,38
NA,expedite an arrangement to end atomic,38
NA,"tests, and we should take the initiative.",38
NA,All the countries I have mentioned say,38
NA,are willing to sign an agreement. I should,38
NA,have thought it would be quite easy to,38
NA,make an agreement with respect to experiunfavorable,38
NA,mental explosions secure in the sense that,38
NA,could not be broken by any of the countries,38
NA,"concerned, and I th nk that Australia, bein»",38
NA,"in a key position, should take the initiative",38
NA,in this matter as we have suggested.,38
NA,I shall not PO into 'the pros and cons,38
NA,the alleged effects of atomic experiments,38
NA,"upon the weather, and of the alleged effects",38
NA,of radiation. I do not accept the dogmatic,38
NA,statements made either way. I think it is,38
NA,unscientific approach (o have people always,38
NA,criticizing or defending the governments,38
NA,concerned in these matters. That is pointed,38
NA,"out in Mr Wilkie's article, which mentions",38
NA,that there are always some professors who,38
NA,say that there is no danger at all. There,38
NA,will be no danger until it eventuates.,38
NA,"we know, there is danger to Japan from the",38
NA,"Russian experiments, and I think similar",38
NA,dangers may appear in Australia.,38
NA,1 hope to have an opportunity to address,38
NA,"the committee again later, but, so that",38
NA,"test vote may be taken on this matter, J",38
NA,now move-,38
NA,"That the amount of the vote-""Departmen t of",38
NA,"Supply, £15.132.000""-b e reduced by £1.",38
NA,out by as an instruction to the Government-,38
NA,That it should take the initiative in bringing,38
NA,together the nations mentioned for the purpose of,38
NA,making an agreement immediately to suspend,38
NA,tests with a view to obtaining a firmer,38
NA,agreement under which they can be banned,38
NA,That is a perfectly feasible proposition.,38
NA,Australia is in a position in which it is,38
NA,"Ausentitled to take that action, because Aus-",38
NA,to tralian territory and the Australian people,38
NA,"are to some extent, admittedly, being sub-",38
NA,jected to danger. We are admittedly sub-,38
NA,"to danger, because if an experiment",38
NA,must be postponed sixteen times owing to,38
NA,weather conditions grave risk would even-,38
NA,they tuate if a mistake were made and an,38
NA,explosion were set off at the wrong moment.,38
NA,is the sense in which I use the word,38
NA,""" risk"". That is what it means in this",38
NA,Mr Beale -Th e right honorable gentle-,38
NA,counman misunderstands what happened.,38
Dr EVATT , I am not concerned with,38
NA,what happened. I rely on the fact that,38
NA,tests must be postponed repeatedly because,38
NA,they weather conditions present an element of,38
NA,danger. Had the first Maralinga explosion,38
NA,been set off when weather conditions were,38
NA,some Australians would have,38
NA,it been exposed to danger. That immediately,38
NA,follows. The Government's case is that,38
NA,"there was no risk, because great care was",38
NA,;,38
NA,taken to ensure that weather conditions,38
NA,were favorable. 1 am putting the same,38
NA,"thing from the obverse viewpoint, and that",38
NA,of is the viewpoint I am asking the committee,38
NA,to consider. We are talking about the same,38
NA,coin. What is wrong with attempting to,38
NA,bring nations together when each is waiting,38
NA,an on the other to ban atomic experiments?,38
NA,Australia should not always wait for other,38
NA,countries to act. It should now take the,38
NA,initiative in these matters. That is the view,38
NA,"of the Australian Labour party, and I sub-",38
NA,mit that it is the view of the great majority,38
NA,"of the people of Australia, as public opinion",38
NA,As polls have demonstrated.,38
Mr HAMILTON ,Canning) 15.21 -I t i<,38
NA,very obvious that the Leader of the Opposi-,38
NA,tion (Dr Evatt) has taken part in the con-,38
NA,sideration of this group of Estimates at this,38
NA,a juncture in an endeavour to give to Labours,38
NA,ideas on atomic tests a slant difTerent from,38
NA,that expressed in the words of his colleagues,38
NA,who have participated in the debate so far.,38
NA,"You. Mr Temporary Chairman, will recall",38
NA,that the right honorable gentleman moved,39
NA,ihe amendment as aninstruction to the Go-,39
NA,vernment that it should initiate top level,39
NA,talks with a view to having nuclear tests,39
NA,.abolished. But if we cast our minds back,39
NA,to what was said last week by the honor-,39
NA,"able member for East Sydney ( Mr Ward),",39
NA,and by other Opposition members yester-,39
NA,"day and to-day, we shall realize that the",39
NA,amendment is not in keeping with the,39
NA,expressed views of the Opposition.,39
NA,Mr Aston -The y all are out of step,39
NA,except the Leader of the Opposition.,39
Mr HAMILTON ,Th e right honorable,39
NA,"gentleman is trying to retrieve the situation,",39
NA,because he has seen that his followers have,39
NA,put the Australian Labour party in a rather,39
NA,awkward position. The theme of their,39
NA,expressions of opinion was that Great,39
NA,Britain and the United States should cease,39
NA,"these nuclear tests, but not one word",39
NA,said about what the Soviet Union should,39
NA,"do. One can take it from that, and from",39
NA,"the events at the Hobart conference, that",39
NA,Labour wants to see that Great Britain,39
NA,"and the United States do these things, but",39
NA,is not worried about what other countries,39
NA,will do. No one who subscribes to those,39
NA,views can truthfully claim to be a responfor,39
NA,"sible person, because so long as the",39
NA,Union continues these tests and refuses to,39
NA,"come to the party to discuss the matter,",39
NA,the Leader of the Opposition said it was,39
NA,"prepared to do, we should be absolutely",39
NA,foolish to curtail our atomic experiments.,39
NA,What methods are employed by Opposiprivilege,39
NA,tion members in criticizing this Governlinga,39
NA,ment's activities in relation to atomic,39
NA,experiments? Last evening that benign lous,39
NA,"gentleman, the honorable member for",39
NA,"Bonython ( Mr Makin), attacked the Gothe",39
NA,vernment over its attitude to the aborigines.,39
NA,I have great respect for the honorable,39
NA,"member's humanitarian outlook, but I have",39
NA,very little respect for the manner in which,39
NA,he expressed his views last evening.,39
NA,It was as plain as daylight that he was,39
NA,ing to shoot down not only this Governprepared,39
NA,ment-a s a member of Her Majesty's of,39
NA,Opposition he was entitled to do that-bu,39
NA,"also our own scientists, the men who had",39
NA,given of their all in order to ensure that,39
NA,these tests would be carried out in the,39
NA,"safest possible manner, and to gather",39
NA,mation that could be applied towards the,39
NA,protection of our civilian population. The this debate.,39
NA,"honorable member, and, indeed, all other",39
NA,"members of the Opposition, know very",39
NA,well lhat everybody concerned in these,39
NA,tests has done everything possible to pro-,39
NA,tect both the white people and the natives.,39
NA,"In addition to that, every precaution was",39
NA,"taken to protect stock, buildings and vari-",39
NA,ous other assets. I should like to ask the,39
NA,honorable member for Bonython ( Mr.,39
NA,"Makin) whether, since the atomic tests have",39
NA,"been carried out in Australia, he has re-",39
NA,"ceived any complaints from missionaries,",39
NA,or other people who are associated with,39
NA,"the native population, that any natives have-",39
NA,suffered as a result of the tests right from,39
NA,the time of the original test on the Monte,39
NA,Bello Islands. I feel certain that he has,39
NA,not received any such complaints.,39
NA,"The Minister for Supply ( Mr Beale), who",39
NA,"is sitting at the table, told the honorable",39
NA,was member for Blaxland ( Mr E. James,39
NA,Harrison) that no instructions had been,39
NA,"issued for the grounding of aircraft, but the",39
NA,honorable member persisted in the line thai,39
NA,"he had been following, which was in keep-",39
NA,ing with the story that was published by cer-,39
NA,tain newspapers that the carcasses of cattle,39
NA,that had been slaughtered at Alice Springs,39
NA,human consumption after the last test,39
NA,Soviet were found to be radio-active.,39
NA,I think that all credit is due to the scien-,39
NA,as tists and other responsible people who,39
NA,delayed exploding the first atomic bomb at,39
NA,Maralinga until weather conditions were,39
NA,suitable. Those of us who have had the,39
NA,of observing the set-up at Mara-,39
NA,to ensure the success of the experi-,39
NA,ment were greatly impressed by the meticu-,39
NA,care that was taken by all concerned to,39
NA,"ensure that, while no harm would befall",39
NA,Australian population-bot h white and,39
NA,coloured people-th e desired results would,39
NA,be obtained. Yet the honorable member,39
NA,for Blaxland criticized our meteorologists.,39
NA,Those of us who went to Maralinga were,39
NA,very favorably impressed by the manne;,39
NA,tryin which the meteorological officers hai!,39
NA,graphs and charts for the purpose,39
NA,obviating any possibiUty that a change,39
NA,t of wind direction would cause the faUout,39
NA,to blow over certain portions of this coun-,39
NA,try and cause damage. Despite all of those,39
NA,"precautions, we have heard very critical",39
NA,inforstatements made by some honorable mem-,39
NA,bers opposite during the last few hours of,39
NA,"Last night, the honorable member for",40
NA,Darebin ( Mr R. W. Holt) also criticized,40
NA,"the atomic tests, and referred to the fact",40
NA,that the Hobart conference of the Aus-,40
NA,tralian Labour party had opposed the hold-,40
NA,ing of them. I could appreciate the Labour,40
NA,party adopting that attitude if the Russians,40
NA,"had ceased testing atomic devices, but I do",40
NA,"not like innuendoes being made, while our",40
NA,"proceedings are being broadcast, that Great",40
NA,Britain and the United States of America are,40
NA,the culprits in this connexion. I agree with,40
NA,the statement by the honorable member,40
NA,for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) last night,40
NA,"that, until Russia is prepared to come to",40
NA,"the party, as it were, we would be very",40
NA,"foolish to curtail our tests, which are",40
NA,designed to provide us with the knowledge,40
NA,"we need. We do not want to be aggressors,",40
NA,but it is important for us to learn all we,40
NA,"possibly can from the atomic tests, not",40
NA,only so that we may retaliate if we are,40
NA,"attacked, but also so that we may apply",40
NA,atomic power to peace-time purposes.,40
NA,It amazes me to hear members of the,40
NA,Opposition criticizing the atomic tests in,40
NA,Australia. As has been rightly pointed out,40
NA,"by fhe Minister, and the scientists associ-",40
NA,"ated with him in this venture, the last test",40
NA,was held in order to obtain information on,40
NA,how best to protect the civilian population,40
NA,from the effects of an atomic bomb explo-,40
NA,"sion. It is no secret whatever that, on the",40
NA,occasion of the particular test that the,40
NA,"Opposition has criticized, in the area likely",40
NA,to be affected by the fall-out there were,40
NA,"sheep, goats and other animals and herbage",40
NA,for them to eat. There was also more herb-,40
NA,age farther away from the centre of the,40
NA,blast which could be fed subsequently to,40
NA,the animals in order to observe whether any,40
NA,degree of radio-activity was present which,40
NA,would render them unfit for human con-,40
NA,"sumption. In addition, scientific experi-",40
NA,ments were carried out in relation to various,40
NA,"kinds of clothing and other material, as",40
NA,"well as buildings, for the purpose of obtain-",40
NA,ing information that would enable us to,40
NA,protect the civilian population from an,40
NA,atomic attack.,40
NA,I was particularly interested in one aspect,40
NA,of the experiment. I produce citrus fruit,40
NA,at an orchard which is situated about 16,40
NA,"miles from Perth, and I wanted to learn",40
NA,the period of time that should elapse after,40
NA,an atomic explosion before fruit that was,40
NA,exposed to radiation would be fit for human,40
NA,R - [54],40
NA,consumption. If we had not taken all,40
NA,necessary precautions in connexion with tbe,40
NA,"recent atomic tests, the Labour party would",40
NA,have every right to kick the Government,40
NA,from one end of the country to the other.,40
NA,But I think that it is an absolute disgrace,40
NA,-for honorable members opposite to criticize,40
NA,our scientists as they have done. I am,40
NA,ashamed of the tactics that the Opposition,40
NA,is employing.,40
NA,The Opposition has submitted a motion,40
NA,to reduce the proposed vote by £1. Last,40
NA,"night, during the debate on another group",40
NA,"of the Estimates, 1 referred to the value of",40
NA,the experiments that are being conducted,40
NA,at the Woomera Rocket Range. It must be,40
NA,realized that these tests cannot be con-,40
NA,ducted without a considerable expenditure,40
NA,if we are to obtain the knowledge we,40
NA,"need. As far as I am concerned, if an",40
NA,"expenditure of £60,000,000 is needed in",40
NA,order to obtain information that might,40
NA,"result in the saving of the lives of 1,000,000",40
NA,people. I am satisfied. As those honorable,40
NA,members who had the privilege of visiting,40
NA,"Maralinga and Woomera saw, many miles of",40
NA,electric wires and telephone cables have,40
NA,"been installed, as well as airstrips and",40
NA,"water-supply services. At Maralinga, it was",40
NA,"necessary to provide a water-supply service,",40
NA,so that the men who were getting on with,40
NA,"the job could enjoy some amenities, because",40
NA,tbe water from the bores was saltier than,40
NA,the sea. It is necessary to incur expenditure,40
NA,on such items. When we were at Woomera,40
NA,"the other day, we saw firing contraptions",40
NA,similar to what one sees on a battleship.,40
NA,Underneath a flat piece of concrete on,40
NA,"the ground were the innards of a battleship,",40
NA,which we had the privilege of inspecting. To,40
NA,instal such equipment under some feet of,40
NA,concrete involves a large expenditure; yet,40
NA,honorable members opposite continue to,40
NA,ask the Government to cut down the,40
NA,expenditure on defence. They are putting,40
NA,"up a sham fight. Only a few minutes ago,",40
NA,the Minister .for Defence Production,40
NA,( Sir Eric Harrison) threw back in the teeth,40
NA,of honorable members opposite their asser-,40
NA,tions in relation to the employment situation,40
NA,in the various defence factories. I advise,40
NA,honorable members opposite to study the,40
NA,"facts of this subject, byfirst-handinspection",40
NA,"and reading, before putting over the air",40
NA,stupid and nonsensical remarks about our,40
NA,"defence preparations, and creating panic in",40
NA,the minds of the Australian people.,40
Mr LUCHETTI ,Macquarie) [5.15] -,41
NA,The committee is considering the Estimates,41
NA,"for the Department of Supply, the Depart-",41
NA,ment of Defence Production and other ser-,41
NA,vices. I ask at the outset: What is the use,41
NA,of considering these items in view of the,41
NA,attitude to-day of the Minister for Defence,41
NA,Production ( Sir Eric Harrison) and other,41
NA,"Ministers, who have indicated that the",41
NA,policy of the Government is undergoing a,41
NA,change with respect to these matters? Just,41
NA,how much can we believe of what is con-,41
NA,tained in these proposed votes? Does the,41
NA,information portray a correct picture of,41
NA,"these departments' activities, or are we to",41
NA,understand that some new figures and some,41
NA,new basis for consideration will be arrived,41
NA,"at, that employees are to be sacked from",41
NA,various departments and that the amount,41
NA,of money to be voted under these Estimates,41
NA,will be considerably in excess of the amount,41
NA,required?,41
NA,"Before dealing with those matters, I join",41
NA,with the Leader of the Opposilion (Dr,41
NA,Evatt) in making a plea to the members of,41
NA,"the committee, to the people of Australia,",41
NA,"and to mankind generally, that we should",41
NA,view the matter of atomic war in an,41
NA,entirely different light. Surely the time has,41
NA,"arrived when we, as responsible people",41
NA,"elected to serve the people of Australia,",41
NA,should get into harmony with the thinkers,41
NA,and humanitarian people throughout the,41
NA,world who feel that some action ought to,41
NA,"be taken in regard to this matter. Are we,",41
NA,"the elected representatives of the people,",41
NA,such arrant cowards that we are not,41
NA,prepared to say that nuclear warfare is,41
NA,horrible and will bring destruction to man-,41
NA,"kind, and that all sane people ought to play",41
NA,their part in seeing that it is overcome once,41
NA,and for all? 1 join with all honorable,41
NA,members who say that the policies of the,41
NA,"Soviet Union, the United States of",41
NA,"America, the United Kingdom and, for that",41
NA,"matter, Australia's contribution too, should",41
NA,"be reviewed. But where ""can we start in",41
NA,dealing with a question of this kind? Do,41
NA,"we agree with the other nations, or do we",41
NA,indicate to the world by our own actions,41
NA,what we think is right? If we really believe,41
NA,"that what we arc doing is right, if we want",41
NA,to save generations of the future from the,41
NA,"most agonizing and terrible death, then it",41
NA,is our responsibilily now. in the National,41
NA,"Parliament of Australia, during a time of",41
NA,"peace, to say to the world, Now is the",41
NA,"time to review this matter; and Australia,",41
NA,as one of the countries which has led the,41
NA,"world in all sorts of reforms, will make",41
NA,its contribution and indicate just where we,41
NA,"stand in relation to i t "" . Consequently, I",41
NA,am pleased to support the Leader of the,41
NA,"Opposition, who, in a clear and definite",41
NA,"manner, highlights the importance of this",41
NA,matter.,41
NA,"I desire, however, to speak upon another",41
NA,subject related to the Department of,41
NA,Defence Production. I should like to take,41
NA,the minds of the committee back not to the,41
NA,statement made by the Minister for Defence,41
NA,Production in this place a few minutes ago,41
NA,but to a statement which he made in this,41
NA,Parliament approximately two years ago. I,41
NA,should like the Minister himself and the,41
NA,people of Australia who are concerned with,41
NA,the defence of this country to take notice,41
NA,"of that statement. Two years ago, he said",41
NA,that the Government was proceeding with,41
NA,"its programme and, in reply to remarks I",41
NA,"was in the course of making, he indicated",41
NA,that the Commonwealth Government was,41
NA,proceeding with the manufacture of the,41
NA,new FN.30 rifle at the Commonwealth,41
NA,Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. His,41
NA,exact words were-,41
NA,In order lo obviate the necessity to rise later,41
NA,to reply to the honorable gentleman in respect ot,41
NA,"the one matter, I now inform him lhal we have",41
NA,already placed orders for the new standard service,41
NA,"rifles, which will be manufactured at Li.hgow.",41
NA,The date of that statement was 16th Septem-,41
NA,"ber, 1954. Two years have elapsed since",41
NA,"that time. Yet, the Minister for Defence",41
NA,Production made a very important state-,41
NA,ment this afternoon in which he said that,41
NA,it will be two years before the Government,41
NA,will obtain the sealed drawings for this,41
NA,weapon. Two years have elapsed since that,41
NA,previous promise was made to the people,41
NA,of Australia. Not only did the Minister,41
NA,"make that statement to this Parliament, but",41
NA,he also went on record in the press. In the,41
NA,""" Daily Telegraph"" of 17th September,",41
NA,1954. appears an article in which the Minis-,41
NA,ter sought to bolster up his own status as,41
NA,a most progressive Minister by declaring,41
NA,that this service rifle was to be manufac-,41
NA,"tured. Inter alia, the article reads-",41
NA,The Government had placed orders for the new,41
NA,s'.andard service rifle. Sir Eric Harrison said,41
NA,today.,41
NA,Sir Erie is Minisier for Defence Production. He,42
NA,told the House of Representatives that the Com-,42
NA,monweal .h Small Arms Factory at Lithgow would,42
NA,manufacture the rifle.,42
NA,The rifle is self-loading.,42
NA,The article then - deals with other aspects.,42
NA,"Yet, the Minister now says that a further",42
NA,two years will elapse before the sealed draw-,42
NA,ings will be available to proceed with the,42
NA,manufacture of this weapon. I suggest that,42
NA,if the Minister had considered the planning,42
NA,of this service rifle with the same meticulous,42
NA,care and detail that he has planned his,42
NA,departure from Australia to take a job in,42
NA,"Mayfair, the rifle would have been much",42
NA,further advanced than it is at the present,42
NA,time.,42
NA,1 have sought information on this matter,42
NA,from the Minister for Defence Production,42
NA,and have asked him to go to Lithgow to,42
NA,make an inspection of the factory. He gave,42
NA,"me a promise that he would visit Lithgow,",42
NA,but he has not yet visited the small arms,42
NA,factory. I do not blame the executive of,42
NA,the small arms factory at Lithgow. I,42
NA,join with the Minister in paying a very,42
NA,fine tribute to those engaged in the factory.,42
NA,I pay a compliment to those engaged on the,42
NA,"Munitions Board generally, but I em-",42
NA,phasize that the Minister ought to set about,42
NA,to see what is wrong and take positive,42
NA,action to deal with this problem. It is of,42
NA,little use dealing with all the other matters,42
NA,relating to defence if this Government can-,42
NA,"not produce a service rifle, or cannot even",42
NA,reach a decision in regard to the matter.,42
NA,"The Minister should, without equivocause",42
NA,"tion, now say what has caused the hold-up",42
NA,in the production of the new service rifle.,42
NA,All the Minister has said in the past must,42
NA,be rejected because it is not in accord with,42
NA,the facts. The facts speak for themselves,42
NA,and I say that the Minister had a duty,42
NA,to-day to tell the committee just how many,42
NA,people are to be dismissed from the various,42
NA,factories. He should have told the comAnglicized,42
NA,mittee this afternoon how many people are,42
NA,to be dismissed from the Commonwealth,42
NA,Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. It has,42
NA,"been reported in the "" Sydney Morning",42
NA,"Herald "" thai dismissals will occur",42
NA,factory and I should like to know from,42
NA,the Minister whether the number will be,42
NA,"500, 700, 250 or any other figure.",42
NA,has had the opportunity to tell the comwhen,42
NA,mittee what the position is.,42
NA,The bitter pill in regard to this matter,42
NA,came from the Minister himself this after-,42
NA,noon when he indicated that a number oi,42
NA,dismissals will take place at the smail arms,42
NA,"factory at Lithgow. When one considers,",42
NA,"the proposed vote for this department, one",42
NA,sees lhat adequate funds are available to,42
NA,produce this rifle. What is wrong? is,42
NA,the Army to blame; does confusion and,42
NA,indecision exist in regard to the manufac-,42
NA,ture of the rifle from the military stand-,42
NA,"point? If that is the case, this commiltee",42
NA,should know and the Minister should say,42
NA,so. If the Colonel Blimps in the United,42
NA,"Kingdom War Office are to blame, thai",42
NA,"should also be stated. Plainly, the Minister",42
NA,should say whether the new rifle is to be,42
NA,"accepted. If it is not, why have definite",42
NA,promises been made over a period of time?,42
NA,It is pertinent to ask whether the rifle has,42
NA,"actually been accepted at this stage, and",42
NA,whether agreement has been reached be-,42
NA,tween the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-,42
NA,tion and the Commonwealth of Australia.,42
NA,I very much doubt whether agreement has,42
NA,"been reached. Indeed, I should say that, if",42
NA,"agreement has been reached, the Australian",42
NA,Government has been treated as the poor,42
NA,"relation. Indeed, the Government is deserv-",42
NA,ing of censure for its failure to send overseas,42
NA,until quite recently responsible officers of,42
NA,the Department of Defence Production in,42
NA,connexion with this matter. That action,42
NA,should have been taken two years ago.,42
NA,It is not much use dealing with this,42
NA,matter in this fashion now. It is not much,42
NA,the Minister telling us what he intends,42
NA,to do at St. Mary's unless we know the type,42
NA,of weapon to be used. So much time has,42
NA,elapsed-tw o years to this stage-ar>< l *,42
NA,further two years will pass before the sealed,42
NA,drawings are received. The Minister for,42
NA,Defence Production made the magnificent,42
NA,statement that the drawings had to be trans-,42
NA,lated from the metric system to an,42
NA,version. One could steal plans,42
NA,from an opponent in a war and go into pro-,42
NA,duction much speedier than this.,42
NA,Sir Eric Harrison -Tel l that to Canada,42
NA,in that or to the United Kingdom.,42
Mr LUCHETTI ," I remind the Minister,",42
NA,"who is a champion of private enterprise,",42
NA,"He that General Motors-Holden's Limited,",42
NA,it decided to change the type of car,42
NA,"it was making, continued production of the",42
NA,existing model and produced a new model,43
NA,within a year without altering a scale or,43
NA,making any changeover at all. If General,43
NA,"Motors-Holden's Limited could do that,",43
NA,certainly the Commonwealth should be able,43
NA,to do much better.,43
NA,It is a reflection upon this Commonwealth,43
NA,that Canada was obliged to step in and,43
NA,"say, "" We will pioneer this work because it",43
NA,is not being done in the United Kingdom,43
NA,and because Australia has not been invited,43
NA,into the councils of Nato to play its part,43
NA,"in the development of this weapon "". It",43
NA,is a most serious matter. It goes beyond the,43
NA,city and district of Lithgow. The question,43
NA,te whether we are to produce in this country,43
NA,"Ihe weapons we need or whether we, like",43
NA,"the Arab nations, shall become dependent",43
NA,upon the gun-runners of the world for the,43
NA,weapons that we require for our security.,43
NA,We can have all the new weapons of,43
NA,"destruction, chaos and suppression, but in",43
NA,the end the areas that we take over must be,43
NA,policed. The only way in which any area,43
NA,can be policed is for the occupation forces,43
NA,to have rifles or weapons of that nature.,43
NA,I suggest that it is time the United King-,43
NA,"dom, the United States of America and the",43
NA,various members of the North Atlantic,43
NA,Treaty Organization finally determined this,43
NA,question one way or the other. It is utterly,43
NA,absurd that we can get plans from Belgium,43
NA,but cannot proceed immediately with the,43
NA,production of this rifle. I ask the com-,43
NA,mittee to consider this as a most important,43
NA,matter. These things warrant a con-,43
NA,sidered statement from the Minister. He,43
NA,has tried to emphasize certain difficulties.,43
NA,The change over to the manufacture of a,43
NA,new rifle should certainly not require four,43
NA,years before tooling-up commences. Any,43
NA,statement made by the Minister for De-,43
NA,fence Production in the past has begged the,43
NA,question.,43
NA,I pay a tribute to the men who have the,43
NA,"capacity, the ingenuity and the skill to do",43
NA,this work. The men at the small arms fac-,43
NA,tory at Lithgow have produced all the,43
NA,weapons that the Administration has asked,43
NA,"them to produce. In addition, they have",43
NA,produced Westinghouse talking apparatus,43
NA,and sealed units for refrigerators and ful-,43
NA,filled many other peace-time orders. Surely,43
NA,the skilled operatives should be kept in that,43
NA,factory so that their services and skill can,43
NA,be called upon in the future. It is most,43
NA,unfortunate that their services will be lost,43
NA,to the nation.,43
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , ( Mr.,43
NA,Bowden) -Order ! The honorable mem-,43
NA,ber's time has expired.,43
Mr BOSTOCK ,Indi) 15.301 -Th e pro-,43
NA,position of the Leader of the Opposition,43
NA,(Dr Evatt) that we should cease atomic,43
NA,"weapon tests reflects, I believe, the wishes",43
NA,of all sensible people in the world. But,43
NA,we will not achieve that position merely,43
NA,by talking about it. To forego essential,43
NA,tests whilst atomic weapons are not com-,43
NA,pletely banned and controlled would be to,43
NA,forego the race to keep pace with our,43
NA,potential enemies in the development of,43
NA,"this modern, disastrous weapon of mass-",43
NA,destruction.,43
NA,Already the United Nations has a Dis-,43
NA,armament Committee which is constantly,43
NA,examining the question of banning and,43
NA,properly controlling atomic weapons. It,43
NA,has been unable to reach any satisfactory,43
NA,arrangement which would ensure the proper,43
NA,policing of such a system. Until that,43
NA,"situation is arrived at, it would be nothing",43
NA,less than suicidal for the western democ-,43
NA,racies to relax their efforts to develop,43
NA,atomic weapons.,43
NA,As was pointed out by the honorable,43
NA,"member for Canning ( Mr Hamilton), in",43
NA,this atomic race we have to consider very,43
NA,carefully not only the attack side but also,43
NA,the defence side of atomic weapons. I,43
NA,notice in the Estimates that last year the,43
NA,"provision for civil defence was £234,000,",43
NA,"of which only £88,782 was spent, and that",43
NA,"this year the provision is only £70,000.",43
NA,That does not seem to me to reflect an,43
NA,energetic policy for the promotion of civil,43
NA,"defence in this country. Quite recently,",43
NA,Lord Montgomery said that unless civil,43
NA,defence is effective in any future atomic,43
NA,"war, it is doubtful whether any nation",43
NA,"could survive. In other words, unless an",43
NA,effective civil defence organization is estab-,43
NA,"lished, the attack organization is likely to",43
NA,fail because the morale of the people will,43
NA,be destroyed. I know that civil defence is,43
NA,a very difficult matter and that a great,43
NA,number of people say that the probability,43
NA,of attack is remote. But the result of an,43
NA,atomic explosion on one of our major,43
NA,centres of population would be such a catas-,43
NA,trophe-suc h a horrible affair-tha t we,43
NA,should take reasonable precautions even if,44
NA,the possibility of attack is not strong.,44
NA,"We could do certain things which, I be-",44
NA,"lieve, would help but which perhaps would",44
NA,not cost a great deal of money. I think,44
NA,"we could do three things. Firstly, we could",44
NA,promulgate information about personal sur-,44
NA,vival. I do not think that there are many,44
NA,people in this country who know what to,44
NA,"do, in the event of an atomic attack, to",44
NA,preserve their own welfare. It would not,44
NA,be very expensive to promulgate through-,44
NA,"out the Commonwealth, and particularly in",44
NA,"our more populous centres, information on",44
NA,some of the simple things that a person can,44
NA,do to preserve his life. To give an example,44
NA,"of the sort of thing that I have in mind,",44
NA,I shall read a paragraph from a publication,44
NA,by the Home Office of the United Kingdom,44
NA,Government. The paragraph reads-,44
NA,People in the open might receive second degree,44
NA,burns . . . on exposed skin at a range of 16,44
NA,rniles from a 10 megaton ground burst bomb.,44
NA,". . . If, however, they should take cover in",44
NA,a few seconds they would escape this damage.,44
NA,"Moreover, at this range the blast wave would",44
NA,not arrive for another minute and a half so that,44
NA,any effects due to the blast in the open . . .,44
NA,could be completely avoided.,44
NA,"That is a very simple instruction, but 1 am",44
NA,prepared to wager that if one asked the first,44
NA,"half-dozen people one met whether, in",44
NA,"event of an atomic explosion, they would",44
NA,be better inside a building or outside,44
NA,they would not know. There are a number,44
NA,of other steps of this kind that we could,44
NA,"take. They would not cost a great deal, and",44
NA,an education campaign of this nature would,44
NA,pay good dividends.,44
NA,The second matter that we should attend,44
NA,"to, and which would not involve very much",44
NA,"expenditure, is the establishment of some",44
NA,"sort of radiation warning network, using",44
NA,existing communication systems in conDepartment,44
NA,junction with the meteorological organizaas,44
NA,"tions, so that i f an atomic",44
NA,place our warning organization could tell,44
NA,people within the radius of radioactive,44
NA,danger that they should do something about,44
NA,it quickly. That is merely a matter of,44
NA,"organization and planning, and would cost",44
NA,virtually nothing.,44
NA,"Thirdly, we should increase very greatly*",44
NA,the number of people who are trained in,44
NA,matters of civil defence. The Government,44
NA,has established a school and has turned,44
NA,four or five classes of trained civil defence,44
NA,instructors. That is not nearly sufficient.,44
NA,We want large numbers of trained people,44
NA,"dispersed throughout the Commonwealth,",44
NA,and particularly throughout the major,44
NA,centres of population. The way in which,44
NA,"this might be done, I suggest, is to transfer",44
NA,Commonwealth responsibility for civil,44
NA,defence from the Department of the Interior,44
NA,to the Department of the Army. That,44
NA,"responsibility should, logically, rest with",44
NA,"the Department of the Army, because, iri",44
NA,"modern times, civil defence is definitely a",44
NA,military responsibility. If an atomic bomb,44
NA,"fell on Sydney or Melbourne, martial law",44
NA,would be inevitable. The military authori-,44
NA,"ties would have to take over, and it seems",44
NA,only logical and reasonable that civil,44
NA,defence functions should be allocated to,44
NA,"the Army. If that were done, and if the",44
NA,Army included civil defence as a major,44
NA,subject in the curriculum of national,44
NA,"service trainees, every year we would turn",44
NA,"out thousands of young men trained, to a",44
NA,"significant degree, in civil defence duties.",44
NA,"Furthermore, they would be dispersed",44
NA,throughout the 'Commonwealth.,44
NA,While I do not advocate the expenditure,44
NA,of large amounts of money on shelters or,44
NA,"things of that kind at this stage, I do believe",44
NA,"that there are a few simple matters, wbich",44
NA,"the would not cost very much, fhat we could",44
NA,attend to. We should disseminate widely,44
NA,"it, information about personal survival. We",44
NA,should tell fhe people of the action that,44
NA,"they should take, on fheir own initiative.",44
NA,"We should establish a warning organization,",44
NA,so that people may be informed whether,44
NA,they are in the path of resultant Tadioactive,44
NA,"fall out from an atomic explosion. Thirdly,",44
NA,we should considerably increase the num-,44
NA,bers of persons trained in civil defence,44
NA,"matters, by transferring that function from",44
NA,the Department of the Interior to the,44
NA,"of the Army, and including it",44
NA,a major .subject in the training of national,44
NA,blast did take service trainees.,44
NA,MT. WENTWORTH (Mackellar) [5.40J.,44
NA,- I support the views put forward by the,44
NA,honorable member for Indi ( Mr Bostock).,44
NA,The three practical courses of action that,44
NA,he has suggested are well worth while. I,44
NA,add to them only one suggestion: The people,44
NA,should be trained in survival procedure in,44
NA,the event of their being in an area of radio-,44
NA,active fallout. The lethal area of fall-,44
NA,out out can be very much greater than the,44
NA,"area directly affected by bomb damage, but",45
NA,fallout need not be lethal if we know how,45
NA,"to deal with it. Therefore, in comparatively",45
NA,large areas those who have been trained will,45
NA,"survive an atomic explosion, while those",45
NA,who have not been trained will die.,45
NA,It is with great regret that I notice the,45
NA,meagre provisions made in these Estimates,45
NA,"for civil defence. Indeed, the whole posi-",45
NA,tion with regard to civil defence is,45
NA,regrettable. The Government has not faced,45
NA,"up to its responsibilities, and it is sadly",45
NA,neglecting this vital matter. I do not,45
NA,suggest that civil defence will ever be,45
NA,anything more than part of a complete,45
NA,"defence plan, but I am reminded by the",45
NA,honorable member for Indi of the words of,45
NA,"Field Marshal Montgomery, who said that",45
NA,without adequate civil defence all other,45
NA,defence preparations are likely to be,45
NA,brought to nothing.,45
NA,What is the position in this country with,45
NA,"regard to civil defence? Last year, the",45
NA,Government allocated for this purpose the,45
NA,"miserably inadequate sum of £234,000, and",45
NA,of that amount it spent barely one-third. On,45
NA,civil defence last year we spent only,45
NA,"£88.000, and this year the allocation is even",45
NA,"less than that amount, being a mere £70,000.",45
NA,I suggest to the Government that it is,45
NA,nonsense to restrict our expenditure to this,45
NA,"amount. Something is wrong. This, surely,",45
NA,cannot be the considered plan of any person,45
NA,who looks at the situation sensibly. In other,45
NA,parts of the world very much more has,45
NA,"been done in the field of civil defence, but",45
NA,"even in other countries, such as the United",45
NA,"States of America and Great Britain, it is",45
NA,admitted that what is being done is still,45
NA,inadequate.,45
NA,We have been told that the Government,45
NA,is following an appreciation of the situation,45
NA,"made by its military advisers, and that",45
NA,there is no danger. I do not know whether,45
NA,the appreciation that is spoken of is to that,45
NA,effect or not. All I can say about it is that,45
NA,the enemy will not consider himself bound,45
NA,by even the most intelligent appreciation of,45
NA,"our Chiefs of Staff. There is a risk, there",45
NA,"is a possibility, and, as the honorable",45
NA,"member for Indi said, while that risk and",45
NA,possibility exist we should do something,45
NA,about them. Some people say that Aus-,45
NA,tralian cities are not targets of a sufficiently,45
NA,high priority to warrant anxiety on our,45
NA,part. That kind of argument portrays,45
NA,complete ignorance of what is happening,45
NA,in the world to-day. The present situation,45
NA,is this: The enemy is not short of nuclear,45
NA,resources. By attacking targets of lower,45
NA,priority he will not in any substantial way,45
NA,diminish his power to attack targets of,45
NA,"higher priority. Indeed, the targets of",45
NA,"lower priority are, perhaps, the more likely",45
NA,"to be attacked, for reasons that Sir Winston",45
NA,Churchill has given. He has suggested,45
NA,"that the great powers, the present possessors",45
NA,"of nuclear weapons, are not likely to em-",45
NA,bark on a metropolitan war involving the,45
NA,destruction of their own cities. Fringe,45
NA,"wars, however, are not ruled out by this",45
NA,"concept of the situation, and the nations",45
NA,that have no nuclear resources may find,45
NA,themselves exposed to the danger of these,45
NA,"fringe wars, and even to the use of nuclear",45
NA,weapons against their territories by their,45
NA,"enemies, simply because they are withoui",45
NA,the power to retaliate. The very fact thai,45
NA,it is unthinkable for the Great Powers to,45
NA,embark on courses which mean metro-,45
NA,"politan war for them, means that they limit",45
NA,their power to come to the aid of those,45
NA,countries on the fringe that may be attacked.,45
NA,"Therefore, looking at the thing reasonably",45
NA,"and logically, one would say that the cities",45
NA,of Australia are in at least as great danger,45
NA,of nuclear attack as are the cities of Great,45
NA,Britain or America-perhap s even greater,45
NA,"danger, because we are a fringe nation and",45
NA,have not that power of atomic retaliation,45
NA,which alone is likely to deter an enemy from,45
NA,attacking.,45
NA,"It is therefore, I think, a matter of very-",45
NA,grave negligence that the Government is,45
NA,leaving this aspect of our defence prepara-,45
NA,tions entirely untouched. The honorable,45
NA,member for Indi said a moment ago that the,45
NA,Department of the Interior was not the,45
NA,right place from which to provide this,45
NA,"defence service. There, again, I agree",45
NA,with him. He is doing no more than echo-,45
NA,ing the most responsible opinion overseas,45
NA,It is wrong to consider this purely as a,45
NA,subsidiary function of a department and,45
NA,put it in a place in the budget-eve n in this,45
NA,slightly contemptuous form-t o which ii,45
NA,does not belong. Though it is defence,45
NA,expenditure it is put under the control of,45
NA,the Department of the Interior.,45
NA,We have done nothing of any con-,45
NA,sequence as yet. The lact that we spent,45
NA,only £88.000 last year shows how little wc,45
NA,have done. It is true that at Mount,46
NA,Macedon the Commonwealth Government,46
NA,has set up a defence school. Of its kind,46
NA,it is an excellent and efficient establish-,46
NA,ment. I was privileged to be present al,46
NA,the opening ceremony. I know some of,46
NA,the instructors and I have had the privi-,46
NA,lege of seeing the courses which are being,46
NA,given to the trainees. There is nothing,46
NA,wrong with the school or the way in which,46
NA,"it is administered, but it is miserably inade-",46
NA,quate for the kind of emergency with which,46
NA,we might be faced. The school is training,46
NA,"a few people, but it is not a few people",46
NA,that one needs in an emergency such as,46
NA,may-w e hope it will not-com e upon us.,46
NA,The honorable member for Indi has been,46
NA,quite right in stressing that we should train,46
NA,masses of people in the measures essential,46
NA,for their own personal survival. This can-,46
NA,not be done by conducting two or three,46
NA,"classes a quarter, each graduating from one",46
NA,"small, single school. This school has, how-",46
NA,"ever, one very valuable aspect. Its indoc-",46
NA,trination courses may allow other people,46
NA,to learn of the problem and thus spread an,46
NA,awareness of it throughout the community.,46
NA,"In this way the school, although not directly",46
NA,"of very much consequence, may have the",46
NA,"excellent,, indirect effect of generating",46
NA,public opinion of the kind that will force,46
NA,"upon the Government a proper, more com-",46
NA,prehensive and more adequate policy for,46
NA,the present situation.,46
NA,I was very pleased to hear the Minister,46
NA,remark some weeks ago that he would be,46
NA,"glad if, at some later time, honorable mem-",46
NA,bers of this House could undergo a short,46
NA,indoctrination course at the school. They,46
NA,would learn the facts of nuclear warfare,46
NA,in their most authentic form-on e,46
NA,which they could not query-an d realize,46
NA,the political implications of the physical,46
NA,facts which they face.,46
NA,Honorable members will recall that for,46
NA,some time now I have tried to press this,46
NA,matter by every means in my power. I am,46
NA,afraid that when it was before the Parlia-,46
NA,ment Jast year the Government misled the,46
NA,House by telling it of the great plans that,46
NA,allegedly were being made; that it was not,46
NA,necessary to mobilize the States or to have,46
NA,"liaison with them and that, as everything",46
NA,"was in hand, all we had to do was to leave",46
NA,it to the Government.,46
NA,"It has not turned out that way nor, as",46
NA,honorable members can see by the miser-,46
NA,"able allocation of £70,000, is anything of",46
NA,the kind projected for next year. It is true,46
NA,that one State-m y own State of New,46
NA,South Wales-ha s endeavoured to set up a,46
NA,"rudimentary organization. It is, however,",46
NA,"no more than rudimentary, though the",46
NA,officers concerned are doing an excellent,46
NA,job within the resources allocated to them.,46
NA,"But the crisis, if there is to be a crisis-",46
NA,and we all hope that there will not be-,46
NA,may come upon us quite suddenly. Who,46
NA,could have told us even a few months ago,46
NA,that the Suez affair would boil up as it did?,46
NA,"Who could have told us, a few weeks ago,",46
NA,that the Suez affair would pass off without,46
NA,resort to force of any kind? Who can tell,46
NA,"us that now? It may be that, if this organi-",46
NA,"zation is to be needed, it will be needed at",46
NA,quite short notice.,46
NA,I wish to say quite clearly and definitely,46
NA,that the implementation of a proper civil,46
NA,defence policy cannot be achieved quickly.,46
NA,It could not be achieved quickly even in a,46
NA,country where there were no constitutional,46
NA,"difficulties, but in this country, where the",46
NA,constitutional division of powers between,46
NA,this Parliament and the State Parliaments,46
NA,is an extra impediment to quick and efficient,46
NA,"organization, even more time is needed. I",46
NA,appeal to the Government once again to get,46
NA,the States together and try to iron out these,46
NA,constitutional difficulties; not to repeat the,46
NA,eyewash which it tried to put over this,46
NA,House when the subject was last being,46
NA,"debated, but to get on and do the job.",46
NA,I am not suggesting that even the most,46
NA,efficient civil defence is enough. Nor am \,46
NA,suggesting that the defence programme has,46
NA,not to include a great deal more than civil,46
NA,defence. This is only one small corner of,46
NA,"defence, but for lack of this the whok",46
NA,programme might fail. For lack of this the,46
NA,lives of our people are in danger. We all,46
NA,hope sincerely that the world-wide plan for,46
NA,effective nuclear control will become a,46
NA,"reality. We know that civil defence, at its",46
NA,"best, can be only a temporary expediency,",46
NA,but until we can induce Russia to join us in,46
NA,a system of nuclear control which would,46
NA,remove the fears of mankind we must take,46
NA,these other precautions. Survival is part of,46
NA,defence.,46
Dr EVATT ,Barton-Leade r of the,46
NA,Opposition) [5.55] - I wish to refer to the,46
NA,speeches of the honorable member for Indi,46
NA,( Mr Bostock) and the honorable member,47
NA,for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth). The nub,47
NA,of the question is to be found in the con-,47
NA,cluding sentences of the speech of the,47
NA,honorable member for Mackellar. I,47
NA,believe that the true inference to be drawn,47
NA,"from the minute, almost contemptuous vote",47
NA,for civil defence which has been referred,47
NA,"to, is that the Government does not en-",47
NA,"visage the possibility of war, especially",47
NA,"nuclear warfare, reaching our shores.",47
NA,"Apparently, the Government believes that it",47
NA,has some justification for its belief. Other-,47
NA,"wise, it would be a most recreant act not to",47
NA,make provision against nuclear warfare.,47
NA,Equally-an d I think that this is implied,47
NA,also in the speech of the honorable member,47
NA,for Mackellar-i f we are to have so con-,47
NA,"temptuous a vote for civil defence, there",47
NA,must be an all-out effort by the Government,47
NA,to ensure that a firm and binding agree-,47
NA,ment is reached in relation to nuclear wea-,47
NA,pons and nuclear experiments. My com-,47
NA,plaint against the Government is that it is,47
NA,doing nothing in this direction.,47
NA,"The honorable member for Mackellar, in",47
NA,"referring to Russia in this chamber, called",47
NA,"the Russians "" the enemy "". I do not think",47
NA,that he should do that. I am not saying that,47
NA,merely as a point of order. Surely the situa-,47
NA,tion has eased to a substantial extent since,47
NA,the summit talks. They were delayed long,47
NA,enough. Sir Winston Churchill suggested,47
NA,them in 1953. That was the new hope of,47
NA,the world. They were not held until two,47
NA,"years later but, undoubtedly, the general",47
NA,climate has greatly improved. It is in that,47
NA,connexion that I want to urge again activity,47
NA,by this Government. Unless some initiative,47
NA,"is taken by Australia, I do not believe that",47
NA,"the great Powers-Russia , Great Britain",47
NA,and the United States of America-wil l take,47
NA,the initiative soon enough. They have all,47
NA,expressed willingness to ban experiments,47
NA,"with nuclear weapons, but an agreement to",47
NA,that effect must be entered into by all of,47
NA,them. All have expressed their willingness.,47
NA,The Russian Foreign Minister did so twice.,47
NA,The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.,47
NA,"Sir Anthony Eden, as recently as 24th July",47
NA,"last, when speaking of the muitiplicaiion",47
NA,"of experiments, said-",47
NA,We would have preferred to deal wilh this,47
NA,"ih the context of a disarmament convention, but we",47
NA,are quite ready now to discuss that matter sepa-,47
NA,. rately from a disarmament convention.,47
NA,"Yet it has been said, in this debate and",47
NA,"elsewhere, that we cannot deal with nuclear",47
NA,"experiments unless we have a firm, binding",47
NA,"agreement covering all nuclear weapons, and",47
NA,their use in war as well as conventional,47
NA,weapons. I believe that is the. approach,47
NA,that should be made. I do not believe that,47
NA,"the United States of America requires any-,",47
NA,"thing more than some firm, binding assur-",47
NA,"ance that if it gives up nuclear weapons,",47
NA,Russia will do so as well. That is evident,47
NA,from statements that have been made on,47
NA,behalf of the United States of America.,47
NA,Could that not be made certain? Is it not,47
NA,a fact-a s I believe it to be-tha t no nuclear,47
NA,experiment of any significance can be con-,47
NA,ducted in any one of the three major coun-,47
NA,tries without the other two knowing about,47
NA,it immediately. If such an experiment is,47
NA,"made, it is readily detectable. Therefore,",47
NA,"in a sense, we could get to tbe situation",47
NA,quickly if there were any breach of the,47
NA,primary undertaking.,47
NA,Sitting suspended from S.S9 to 8 p.m.,47
Dr EVATT ,Durin g the time remain-,47
NA,"ing to me, I should like to summarize as",47
NA,quickly as I can what seem to us to be the,47
NA,salient points in this great controversy over,47
NA,experiments with the atomic and hydrogen,47
NA,"bombs, experiments conducted, of course, on",47
NA,the assumption that in some circumstances,47
NA,they will be utilized in warfare. The Oppo-,47
NA,sition has sought to reduce the proposed vote,47
NA,in order to demand of the Government that,47
NA,it take some action other than that which,47
NA,it is taking in connexion with these experi-,47
NA,ments. We demand of the Government,47
NA,that it bring the matter before the three,47
NA,great powers which are the sole possessors,47
NA,of atomic and hydrogen bombs; and I re-,47
NA,mind the Government that the leaders of,47
NA,each of those countries have expressed their,47
NA,willingness to agree to the banning of the,47
NA,experiments subject to reasonable safe-,47
NA,guards for the protection of them all. I,47
NA,have referred to the statement by Sir,47
NA,Anthony Eden that he was quite willing to,47
NA,separate the experimental use of these,47
NA,bombs from the general problem of disarma-,47
NA,ment and to treat that as the first step to-,47
NA,wards major disarmament. The same offer,47
NA,has been made twice by the Foreign Minis-,47
NA,ter of Russia and by the authorities in the,47
NA,"United States of America, again subject to",47
NA,certain safeguards. I point out that it is a,47
NA,vital part of our case that we have a safe-,48
NA,"guard in the fact that, because of the",48
NA,marvellous -instruments available to scien-,48
NA,"tists, it is possible to detect from a great",48
NA,distance whether a bomb has been exploded.,48
NA,"By this means, any of the three powers can",48
NA,detect whether the agreement has been,48
NA,breached or honoured.,48
NA,"One object, of course, in banning the",48
NA,use of bombs for experimental purposes is,48
NA,the banning of their use altogether for pur-,48
NA,"poses of war, and in this connexion I desire",48
NA,to make a short reference to a statement,48
NA,"appearing in fhe "" Christian Science",48
NA,"Monitor "" of 29th June, as published in the",48
NA,United States of America. I t sets out that,48
NA,official army estimates showed that a full-,48
NA,scale nuclear attack on the Union of Soviet,48
NA,Socialist Republics could kill several hundred,48
NA,"millions of people, including probably",48
NA,millions of America's own allies outside the,48
NA,"Soviet Union, depending on which way the",48
NA,wind was blowing. That is an official state-,48
NA,ment that was published despite censorship,48
NA,in the United States of America. Senator,48
NA,Duff asked this question of General Gavin-,48
NA,If we got into a nuclear war and our strategic,48
NA,Air Force made an assult in force against Russia,48
NA,with nuclear weapons so that the weapons exploded,48
NA,in a way where the prevailing winds would carry,48
NA,"them south east over Russia, what would be the",48
NA,effect in the way of death?,48
NA,"General Gavin said he would answer, but",48
NA,he added that the question should be,48
NA,directed to the Air Force. He then gave,48
NA,this reply-,48
NA,Current planning estimates run on the order,48
NA,several hundred million deaths. That would be,48
NA,"either way, depending on whicb way the wind",48
NA,blew.,48
NA,That is surely ample evidence to support,48
NA,the assertion that the winds have a definite,48
NA,effect upon the area in which the greatest,48
NA,amount of damage and destruction and the,48
NA,greatest number of deaths occur. It is also,48
NA,supported by the Maralinga tests. We,48
NA,know that those tests were postponed,48
NA,because the wind was not blowing in the,48
NA,direction for which provision had been,48
NA,made. The weapon was not released until,48
NA,the signal was given that the wind was,48
NA,blowing in the required direction. I repeat,48
NA,that it supports the statement in the,48
NA,""" Christian Science Monitor"" that the",48
NA,direction of the wind does affect the area,48
NA,contaminated from radiation. In those,48
NA,"circumstances, i t is obvious that there Js an",48
NA,"element of peril, and it is only probably",48
NA,"because great, scientific achievement has",48
NA,-been favoured by chance that the experi-,48
NA,ments have been conducted so far without,48
NA,great damage and loss of life. We all,48
NA,know that loss and injury did result from,48
NA,"the Bikini experiment, but in that case an",48
NA,"H-bomb, not an atom bomb, was exploded.",48
NA,"Actually, I think it caused the deaths of a",48
NA,number of Japanese fishermen who were,48
NA,in the affected area.,48
NA,"That New Zealander, Lord Rutherford,",48
NA,the great mathematician and nuclear,48
NA,"physicist, first saw the way in which this",48
NA,field of science could lead to inventions,48
NA,"which, properly controlled, would bring",48
NA,"comfort, happiness and power to thousands",48
NA,of millions of people throughout the world.,48
NA,What we want from the leaders of nations,48
NA,"is a spirit of determination and humanity,",48
NA,without which these weapons must become,48
NA,"the curse of mankind, because, i f they are",48
NA,used for mass destruction during a war.,48
NA,there is no doubt that they could destroy,48
NA,the very fabric of the earth itself. We of,48
NA,"the Opposition, therefore, ask what is being",48
NA,done in this connexion. Nearly two years,48
NA,"ago, at the federal conference of the Aus-",48
NA,"tralian Labour party, this matter was dis-",48
NA,"cussed and, among other things, this was",48
NA,said-,48
NA,The development of atomic weapons has reached,48
NA,such dimensions that the peoples of the world,48
NA,are now faced with the stark and terrifying spec-,48
NA,tacle of a possible atomic world war causing,48
NA,"a danger to the very .fabric of the «arth, its",48
NA,"atmosphere and all its inhabitants, which is so",48
NA,of real that distinguished scientists refer to the,48
NA,prospect with a sense of desperation.,48
NA,Those were the words used by that great,48
NA,scientist -Einstein and his seven colleagues,48
NA,who .signed the declaration published,48
NA,immediately after his death. The declara-,48
NA,"tion of the Australian Labour movement, to",48
NA,"which I have referred, continues-",48
NA,This desperation is partly -due to the vacillation,48
NA,and delay in arranging high-level political talks,48
NA,aiming at the effective prevention of the -use of,48
NA,"atomic and ""'hydrogen bombs 'by any nation,",48
NA,whether for purposes of war or experimental,48
NA,purposes.,48
NA,"That declaration was criticized, but it",48
NA,"pointed fhe way to a solution, because, at",48
NA,"the great meetings held after that time, the",48
NA,leaders of the three nations to which I have,48
NA,"referred made to each other, and to the",48
NA,"world, 'the offers to which I have alluded.",48
NA,Nobody will deny that the Minister for,49
NA,Supply ( Mr Beale) is very energetic in,49
NA,"cariying out his duties, but the real respon-",49
NA,"sibility lies not with him, but with the",49
NA,Government. It should point out that our,49
NA,country is being used as the place for con-,49
NA,ducting these experiments. We all realize,49
NA,"that, originally, Woomera was never",49
NA,intended for atomic or hydrogen experi-,49
NA,ments; it was arranged between the Chifley,49
NA,Government and the Labour government,49
NA,of Great Britain that it should be used for,49
NA,experiments seeking to obtain an answer,49
NA,to the V - l and V-2 guided missiles which,49
NA,nearly turned the tide of war against us,49
NA,in 1944 and 1945. I t is now being used,49
NA,for these other purposes.,49
NA,Mr Beale -Maraling:' . had nothing to ilo,49
NA,"with that. ,",49
Dr EVATT , 1 am not speaking aboul,49
NA,Maralinga; I am referring to the original,49
NA,purpose for which that great space at,49
NA,Woomera was to bs used. What is being,49
NA,done about it now? In to-day's issue of,49
NA,"the "" Sun Pictorial"", Douglas Wilkie, who,",49
NA,"like Russo of the "" Argus "", is one of the",49
NA,best informed of any commentators in Aus-,49
NA,"tralia on international affairs, said-",49
NA,We're near to that point al v/hich the peoples,49
NA,of the world will insist on putting an end to,49
NA,further nuclear test-explosions-A-bom b and,49
NA,H-bomb.,49
NA,Let the Government take the initiative. It,49
NA,"will get 100 per cent, support from the",49
NA,"Opposition and, I believe, from those coun-",49
NA,tries which are concerned with this ques-,49
NA,"tion. Certainly, it will get support from",49
NA,suffering humanity.,49
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Adermann) -,49
NA,Order! The honorable gentleman's time,49
NA,has expired.,49
Mr BEALE ,Parramatta-Ministe r for,49
NA,Supply) [8.10] - I have only a few minutes,49
NA,tn which to address the committee. Before,49
NA,I deal specifically with what the Leader of,49
NA,"the Opposition (Dr Evatt) said, may I",49
NA,.nention one or two matters which were,49
NA,raised earlier in the debate? The honorable,49
NA,member for Blaxland ( Mr E. James that,49
NA,Harrison) read a passage from the recent,49
NA,"report of the Nuclear Research Foundation,",49
NA,uttering a criticism of the allocation,49
NA,the Lucas Heights reactor. Since the honorin,49
NA,"able member has done that, perhaps I might",49
NA,be permitted to read a letter which I,49
NA,NA,49
NA,"man of the foundation, in which he said-",49
NA,The foregoing criticisms are not intended in any,49
NA,way to reflect on the Atomic Energy Commission,49
NA,"itself or on you, sir, as the Minister responsible",49
NA,for the work of the Commission and for the pro-,49
NA,vision of adequate finance for its proper require-,49
NA,ments.,49
NA,All of us want as much money as possible to,49
NA,"be spent on the Lucas Heights project, but",49
NA,a lot of other projects in Australia also,49
NA,require money. I f there is to be any sug-,49
NA,gestion that the Government has not done,49
NA,its duty in regard to this item on the,49
NA,"Estimates, I point out that we have prac-",49
NA,tically doubled the vote for the Lucas,49
NA,Heights project this year. An extra,49
NA,"£1,000,000 has been provided.",49
NA,Mr Chambers -Th e honorable member,49
NA,for Blaxland did not mention Lucas,49
NA,Heights.,49
Mr BEALE ,I f he did not mention,49
NA,"Lucas Heights, heaven only knows what he",49
NA,was talking about! That is what he was,49
NA,supposed to be talking aboul. The pro-,49
NA,posed vote for this project for this financial,49
NA,"year is £2,436,000, compared wilh a vole",49
NA,"of £1,416,000 which was placed on the",49
NA,Estimates last year. That seems to nie a,49
NA,pretty handsome recognition of rhe fact,49
NA,that this Government realizes that the pro-,49
NA,ject is an important project and that in a,49
NA,"time of financial stringency, the Government",49
NA,is prepared to allocate a big increase in,49
NA,funds to bring that project to completion.,49
NA,The honorable member for Blaxland also,49
NA,took the trouble to make some slighting,49
NA,remark which was based on a report in the,49
NA,""" Daily Telegraph"". I f the honorable",49
NA,member gets any pleasure out of the fact,49
NA,that a newspaper reporter rings up a Minis-,49
NA,"ter's wife, is rude to her, and publishes a",49
NA,"snarling report next morning that "" a woman",49
NA,who answered the telephone said he was,49
NA,"asleep"", the honorable member is not as",49
NA,decent a fellow as I thought. I take it very,49
NA,hard that a man like himself should bother,49
NA,to quote a newspaper on a paltry matter,49
NA,of that sort.,49
NA,I should also like to answer something,49
NA,was said by the honorable member for,49
NA,"Bonython ( Mr Makin), who very rightly",49
NA,expressed some anxiety about the natives in,49
NA,"for connexion with atomic tests. I have said,",49
NA,"the House, in general terms, that the",49
NA,most elaborate precautions have been taken,49
NA,io safeguard the safety of the natives,50
NA,entirely. I shall not attempt to deal with,50
NA,"the matter in detail now, but perhaps the",50
NA,committee will permit me to refer to a,50
NA,letter which 1 wrote on 20th September to,50
NA,the appropriate Minister i n the Labour,50
NA,"Government in Western Australia, Mr .",50
NA,"Brady, M . L . A . , who had made inquiries",50
NA,about this matter. I t is a long letter which,50
NA,indicates w i th some precision the care that,50
NA,"we take, and w i t h the concurrence of",50
NA,honorable members I shall incorporate it in,50
NA,""" Hansard "" . The letter reads as follows:-",50
NA,I have now had an opportunity of reading the,50
NA,"speech made by Mr W. Grayden, M.L.A., in the",50
NA,"Legislative Assembly on ISth August, and appre-",50
NA,ciate your courtesy in forwarding this with your,50
NA,letter of 21st August.,50
NA,At the outset let me say that I share your,50
NA,anxiety that nothing should be done to jeopardize,50
NA,the welfare and precarious living of the native.,50
NA,This has always been in the forefront of our,50
NA,minds in planning operations both in respect of,50
NA,the rocket range at Woomera and of the atomic,50
NA,weapons proving ground at Maralinga.,50
NA,We have tried not only to protect the natives,50
NA,from any hazard associated with the operation,50
NA,"of these ranges, but also to disturb their normal",50
NA,"mode of living as little as possible, and to impose",50
NA,no unnecessary restriction on their movements.,50
NA,My Department has worked in close co-operation,50
NA,with the Department of Native Welfare both in,50
NA,"South and Western Australia, and the helpful atti-",50
NA,tude of both States has been appreciated.,50
NA,You might like to have a brief outline of the,50
NA,measures which have been put into operation for,50
NA,looking after native welfare in the area nearer to,50
NA,"Maralinga, and this I have set out below-",50
NA,1. Two or three mobile ground patrols,50
NA,operate between Tarcoola and Ernabella,50
NA,to keep a check on the location and,50
NA,movement of all natives in this area.,50
NA,2. There are also scientific teams operating,50
NA,east towards Mabel Creek and up to 120,50
NA,miles to the north-west of our base on,50
NA,"the Emu claypan. These teams, while",50
NA,"not specifically for native patrol, are",50
NA,briefed to report any indication that,50
NA,natives are in this area.,50
NA,3. These patrols are in daily contact with,50
NA,"each other, with Natives Affairs Oflicer",50
NA,Macaulay at the Meteorological Station,50
NA,"in the Rawlinsons, and with the Mara-",50
NA,linga and Woomera Ranges.,50
NA,4. While there is not the slightest danger to,50
NA,the health of natives in and around the,50
NA,station properties in central South Aus-,50
NA,tralia arising from the tests at Mara-,50
NA,"linga, it is considered politic to keep",50
NA,regular checks on the radio-active,50
NA,"ground "" in these areas, and in addition",50
NA,to the large number of air sampling,50
NA,stations distributed throughout the Aus-,50
NA,"tralian continent, there are sampling",50
NA,devices located at each of the station,50
NA,properties referred to above.,50
NA,Not only do these supplement the data,50
NA,obtained from the main continental,50
NA,"sampling system, but they provide specific",50
NA,confirmation that no significant radio-,50
NA,active material has fallen on the nearby,50
NA,inhabited areas.,50
NA,5. Betore any major test is conducted at,50
NA,"Maralinga, extensive low level aerial",50
NA,reconnaissance over a wide sector centred,50
NA,on Maralinga and extending out ajout,50
NA,200 miles from the. firing area is made,50
NA,with meticulous care. This will detect,50
NA,the presence of any natives not pre-,50
NA,viously accounted for. In the event of,50
NA,any natives being discovered in locations,50
NA,"which might give rise to public anxiety,",50
NA,the tests would be held up until the,50
NA,natives were clear of these areas.,50
NA,6. The only area in which the radio-active,50
NA,contamination foUowing a test might,50
NA,"reach a level prejudicial to health, is in",50
NA,"the near vicinity of the firing sites, and",50
NA,this area will be constantly supervised,50
NA,by the Range authorities.,50
NA,Although radio-active material will fall,50
NA,"outside this aiea, it will be of such low",50
NA,intensity as not to be a health hazard.,50
NA,"Further, it will decay rapidly with time",50
NA,and could not possibly be a danger to,50
NA,any natives who might subsequently,50
NA,move into the area.,50
NA,7. As part of the scientific plan to assess the,50
NA,effectiveness of the nuclear devices tested,50
NA,"at Maraiinga, extensive aerial and ground",50
NA,"survey of the radio-active "" fallout"" are",50
NA,made with highly sensitive measuring,50
NA,instruments to distances of more than 100,50
NA,miles from the firing sites. These measure-,50
NA,ments provide additional confirmation,50
NA,that the scientific predictions were,50
NA,realized and that no harmful radio-,50
NA,active material was deposited on areas,50
NA,used by human beings or live-stock.,50
NA,The initiation and direction of the above,50
NA,measures is the direct responsibility of the Atomic,50
NA,"Weapons Tests Safety Committee, which con-",50
NA,sists of eminent Australian scientists and which,50
NA,is present in person at each of the major trials,50
NA,at Maralinga.,50
NA,I trust the foregoing information will not only,50
NA,inform you of the extreme care with which we,50
NA,"are planning all these operations, but will enable",50
NA,you to reply to any uninformed criticism that,50
NA,these highly important and essential British Com-,50
NA,monwealth defence operations are prejudicing,50
NA,native life and welfare in Australia.,50
NA,Mr Chambers -Wha t about the con-,50
NA,taminated cattle?,50
Mr BEALE ,Th e story about the con-,50
NA,""" backtaminated cattle is simply that there were",50
NA,no contaminated cattle. The day after this,50
NA,"report appeared, the "" Adelaide Advertiser """,50
NA,published a complete and flat denial by the,50
NA,gentleman who was supposed to have given,50
NA,the report to it.,50
NA,The honorable member for Darebin ( Mr.,51
NA,"R. W. Holt) made, if I may say so, an",51
NA,earnest and well-intentioned speech on,51
NA,what I acknowledge is a serious subject.,51
NA,"I regret to say that, in trying to make his",51
NA,"case, he misquoted the effect of the Medi-",51
NA,cal Research Council's report in Great,51
NA,Britain and the effect of the report of the,51
NA,United States Academy of Science. He,51
NA,certainly misquoted the intent and effect,51
NA,of the British Labour party's resolution,51
NA,Which was passed at Blackpool a few weeks,51
NA,"ago. I have the resolution here, and it is",51
NA,quite clear that the British Labour party,51
NA,did not intend to pass a resolution advocat-,51
NA,ing a unilateral discontinuance of atomic,51
NA,tests. Yet that is precisely what the honor-,51
NA,able gentleman suggested.,51
NA,"Obviously, the honorable member, along",51
NA,"with everybody else, including the members",51
NA,"of this Government, is anxious to see these",51
NA,"tests brought under control and, in due",51
NA,"course, discontinued. But to suggest that",51
NA,"the Labour party of Great Britain, like the",51
NA,"very foolish Labour party in this chamber,",51
NA,passed a resolution advocating a unilateral,51
NA,discontinuance of tests is to insult the intelli-,51
NA,gence of the British Labour party. A,51
NA,resolution was passed by the Australian,51
NA,"Labour party caucus, by a narrow majority,",51
NA,advocating the unilateral abolition of atomic,51
NA,bomb tests. I suggest that if the proposal,51
NA,"were put up to the caucus again, it would",51
NA,not go through; but it is on record. There-,51
NA,"fore, it is interesting to find the honorable",51
NA,member for Darebin so misguided as to,51
NA,advocate in this committee that line of,51
NA,approach.,51
NA,Mr R. W. Holt -Doe s the Minister,51
NA,oppose the churches?,51
Mr BEALE , I do not oppose the,51
NA,"churches. The churches, in common .with",51
NA,"most thinking people, are anxious to see an",51
NA,end to this atomic armaments race. This,51
NA,"Government, as I shall show, is doing its",51
NA,"utmost, along with the governments of the",51
NA,"United Kingdom, and the United States ot",51
NA,"America, to get some sort of workable and",51
NA,enforceable agreement on the subject. But,51
NA,until we can get something which will pro-,51
NA,"tect us, we will not expose this country and",51
NA,"our allies to being overwhelmed, as by an",51
NA,"avalanche, by the forces of Russia, a coun-",51
NA,try which is completely superior in other,51
NA,forms of armaments.,51
NA,The honorable member misquoted the,51
NA,statement of Mr Adlai Stevenson. Mr.,51
NA,Adlai Stevenson did not advocate the uni-,51
NA,lateral banning of the hydrogen bomb.,51
NA,The words that he used were-,51
NA,... the United States should take the lead,51
NA,in working out a ban on hydrogen bomb tests.,51
NA,That does not mean that the United States,51
NA,should abandon its testing of the bomb,51
NA,Unless Russia gave some sort of promise or,51
NA,"undertaking, or America had some sort",51
NA,"of working arrangement with Russia, to do",51
NA,the same thing.,51
NA,"I now turn to the real nub of this matter,",51
NA,and that is the statement by the Leader of,51
NA,the Opposition. The honorable member,51
NA,for Darebin and some of his misguided,51
NA,"friends are prepared to say, "" Let Australia",51
NA,discontinue these tests. Let Great Britain,51
NA,discontinue these tests. Let America dis-,51
NA,continue these tests. But let Russia go on,51
NA,"and on and on """,51
NA,Mr Chambers -H e did not say that.,51
Mr BEALE ,Tha t is the effect of the,51
NA,resolution that the Labour party caucus,51
NA,adopted the other day.,51
NA,Mr Chambers -Th e Leader of the,51
NA,Opposition advocated bringing the leaders,51
NA,of nations together.,51
Mr BEALE ,Tha t is what the Leader,51
NA,"of the Opposition said in the chamber, but",51
NA,it is not what he said in caucus.,51
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! Members,51
NA,of the Opposition must keep quiet.,51
NA,Mr R. W. Holt- I rise to order. I ask,51
NA,for an unqualified withdrawal of the state-,51
NA,ment that we are in favour of letting Russia,51
NA,go ahead with the development of the atom,51
NA,bomb.,51
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,51
NA,able member is out of order. If he con-,51
NA,"siders that he has been misrepresented, be",51
NA,may make a personal explanation.,51
Mr BEALE ,Thes e boys do not like,51
NA,the truth. They run away from it every,51
NA,"day of the week. To-night, the Leader of",51
NA,the Opposition did not go as far as he went,51
NA,in caucus. He has submitted an amend-,51
NA,"ment, the purpose of which is to reduce the",51
NA,proposed vote for the Department of Supply,51
NA,"by £1- a sort of motion of censure, I sup-",51
NA,pose-a s a direction to the Government to,51
NA,get the powers together to ensure the ban-,51
NA,ning of tests by agreement. That is a some-,51
NA,what different thing.,51
NA,Mr Chambers -I t is different from,52
NA,what the Minister said.,52
Mr BEALE ,No . I said that the,52
NA,caucus had previously passed a resolution,52
NA,in favour of Australia abandoning tests.,52
NA,But to-night the right honorable gentleman,52
NA,is not prepared to go that far. I am not,52
NA,surprised that he is not prepared to go that,52
NA,"far because on 22nd February last, in",52
NA,"answer to an interjection by myself, he said,",52
NA,"in this chamber, that no one seriously advo-",52
NA,cated the cessation of experimental explo-,52
NA,sions except by international regulation and,52
NA,by consenc. That is why he cannot now an aerial inspection.,52
NA,genuinely advocate unilateral abandonment.,52
NA,But he does want to have the proposed,52
NA,for the Department of Supply reduced as a,52
NA,direction to the Government to get the,52
NA,powers together. It all sounds very nice.,52
NA,I suggest that it might be a good idea,52
NA,if the committee had the opportunity,52
NA,run its mind over the history of this matter,52
NA,and realize what has been done by the,52
NA,great democracies to try to bring about,52
NA,some sort of agreement on this subject,52
NA,already. For Australia now to mount its,52
NA,"white charger like a paladin, come into the",52
NA,"arena, strike an attitude, and say, ""We",52
NA,shall get the great powers together to,52
NA,achieve this thing which Great Britain,52
NA,America have been struggling for since,52
NA,"1954 "", is just childish nonsense, and everyThis",52
NA,"body knows it. In 1954, at the United",52
NA,"Nations General Assembly, a motion was",52
NA,put forward by India for what it called,52
NA,standstill of atomic explosion. It is signifiof,52
NA,cant that Russia did not open its mouth,52
NA,"that session, did not advocate this course,",52
NA,and did not raise the matter in any form,52
NA,all.,52
NA,Mr Chambers -Ther e was a later meetit,52
NA,ing in 1954.,52
Mr BEALE , I am coming to that. In,52
NA,"1955 Russia did bring forth, before a subthere",52
NA,"committee on disarmament, a somewhat",52
NA,elaborate proposal for a cessation of,52
NA,"thermo-nuclear tests, which in that context",52
NA,"mean both hydrogen and atomic explosions,",52
NA,coupled with a freeze of conventional arms,52
NA,-whic h was very nice because Russia had,52
NA,"50 per cent, more conventional arms than by the wayside.",52
NA,all the rest of the free world put together-,52
NA,"the liquidation of all foreign bases, and the",52
NA,acceptance of a solemn obligation not,52
NA,"use nuclear weapons. No enforcement, no",52
NA,"sanctions, no control! It is little wonder",52
NA,that that proposal Went by default and was,52
NA,not even raised by anybody at the meeting.,52
NA,It is worth mentioning that at about that,52
NA,time President Eisenhower came forward,52
NA,"with his open skies proposal, which was a",52
NA,fair and honest proposal for inspection of,52
NA,"all forms of armament, and that was turned",52
NA,down by Russia. So do not let us say that,52
NA,the democracies have not been putting up a,52
NA,struggle to try to bring this thing under,52
NA,control.,52
NA,Mr Chambers -Tha t proposal was for,52
Mr BEALE ,I t was for an open skies,52
NA,vote aerial inspection of armaments.,52
NA,Mr Chambers -The y did not agree to it.,52
Mr BEALE ,O f course they did not.,52
NA,"In December, 1955, Sir Anthony Eden said",52
NA,to that the United Kingdom could not agree,52
NA,to the stopping of nuclear tests unless there,52
NA,were some sort of international supervision,52
NA,"and control. He went on to say, "" But my",52
NA,Government is prepared at any time and at,52
NA,any place to have discussions on the control,52
NA,"and abolition of atomic bomb tests "". There",52
NA,never was a reply by Russia to that open,52
NA,"offer. Between March and May, 1956, the",52
NA,and disarmament sub-committees of the United,52
NA,Nations again had this matter under discus-,52
NA,"sion, and again proposals were put forward.",52
NA,time they were Anglo-French proposals,52
NA,"fbr comprehensive disarmament, but they",52
NA,also included the abolition of the atomic,52
NA,a tests. The Soviet replied with a proposal,52
NA,"its own, somewhat similar to its previous",52
NA,"at proposal, but again without any sort of",52
NA,supervision or control. For the democra-,52
NA,at cies to agree to any proposal Which does,52
NA,"not, somewhere or Other, have a hope in",52
NA,that the agreement could be supervised,52
NA,"and controlled would be, of course, just",52
NA,folly. Russia entered that particular dis-,52
NA,cussion with no better proposal than that,52
NA,should be a solemn obligation on the,52
NA,part of all powers that they would make a,52
NA,"solemn promise. It would be, if you like,",52
NA,"one of those forms of words, but nothing",52
NA,"more than that, with no sanctions to back",52
NA,"it, no inspection of any sort, and it is little",52
NA,wonder that that proposal lapsed and went,52
NA,"Quite recently, Sir Anthony Eden's Go-",52
NA,"to vernment, like this Government, and like",52
NA,"every other government, including, I believe,",52
NA,"the Russian Government, has become con-",53
NA,cerned with the implications of the thermo-,53
NA,"nuclear explosion, that is to say, a hydro-",53
NA,"gen bomb explosion, as distinct from an",53
NA,atomic explosion. This is a distinction,53
NA,which members on the Opposition benches,53
NA,Jo not seem to understand. I have heard,53
NA,three speeches this afternoon by Labour,53
NA,members. Two of the speakers obviously,53
NA,did not know the difference between an,53
NA,atomic bomb explosion and a hydrogen,53
NA,bomb explosion. Sir Anthony Eden said,53
NA,that although his Government would prefer,53
NA,io deal with the question of controlling,53
NA,atomic explosions in the context of a dis-,53
NA,"armament convention, nevertheless the ques-",53
NA,"tion had become so technical, so bogged",53
NA,"down in offer and counter-offer, in poli-",53
NA,"tical and international diplomatic manoeuvre,",53
NA,"that he now, made an open offer that hi*-",53
NA,"Government stood immediately ready, at",53
NA,"any time and at any place, to discuss a",53
NA,"limitation of tests, separately or in any distion",53
NA,armament context whatsoever.,53
Dr EVATT ,Tha t is a big step forward.,53
Mr BEALE , I agree with the Leader,53
NA,of the Opposition that that is a big step,53
NA,"forward, and it is one with which we heartily",53
NA,"agree, because the hydrogen bomb offers",53
NA,sinister possibilities for the world unless,53
NA,mankind does something about it. I,53
NA,remind this committee that the Go-,53
NA,vernment will not permit such a bomb,53
NA,"io be tested in Australia, but that is",53
NA,another matter altogether. The only reply,53
NA,hv Russia to that proposal was the letting,53
NA,off of another series of hydrogen bombs,53
NA,in Russia. And there the matter stands.,53
NA,All I say to the Parliament is that this Go-,53
NA,vernment will not yield to any one in its,53
NA,belief that the time must come when the,53
NA,nations will be compelled to agree among,53
NA,"themselves to control and, if possible, to",53
NA,ban the holding of these tests. We have,53
NA,played our part in every discussion abroad,53
NA,on this matter. Our views are well known,53
NA,and we shall continue to assert them. If,53
NA,it is any consolation to the Leader of the,53
NA,"'>r>r)osition, quite apart from the motion h?",53
NA,"proposed to-night, this Government will",53
NA,take as foremost a part as it can take in,53
NA,"future discussions, but that does not mean",53
NA,getting up on a post and bawling at the,53
NA,too of our voices and making fools of,53
NA,ouselves.,53
NA,r,53
NA,Mr Curtin -N o wonder they call you,53
NA,""" Paddles "".",53
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,53
NA,able member for Kingsford-Smith is entirely,53
NA,"out of order in many ways, and he knows",53
NA,it. He will be out of the chamber if he,53
NA,does not behave.,53
Mr BEALE , I have spoken a little,53
NA,"warmly on this subject, because I feel",53
NA,warmly about it. It is a matter of great,53
NA,significance to all of us. I think that most,53
NA,honorable members of the Australian,53
NA,"Labour party, excluding the gentleman who",53
NA,"just interjected, think just as seriously about",53
NA,"this matter as we do, but the one thing that",53
NA,seems to divide the Government on the one,53
NA,hand and some members of the Australian,53
NA,Labour party on the other hand- I know,53
NA,it is not so with all of them-i s whether in,53
NA,"the meantime, struggling and doing our",53
NA,utmost with our friends to get some sort of,53
NA,"workable, enforceable agreement, which",53
NA,will diminish and finally bring to a termina-,53
NA,"the holding of these tests, we should go",53
NA,on with these very small atomic tests in,53
NA,"Australia, helping Great Britain and helping",53
NA,ourselves. Does the Australian Labour,53
NA,"party, or that little group of it to which I",53
NA,"have referred, say that if a Labour govern-",53
NA,ment had been in power a year or two ago,53
NA,"it would have said "" No "" if Great Britain",53
NA,"had said, "" We offer you all of the guaran-",53
NA,tees of complete safety in this matter. Yours,53
NA,is the only country in our world that has,53
NA,the vacant space in which these bombs,53
NA,can be tested. Will you help us by allowing,53
NA,"these small tests to take place? "" I do not",53
NA,believe that Labour supporters would have,53
NA,been so craven as to adopt that attitude. I,53
NA,do not believe that they have so little regard,53
NA,"for Great Britain, for the Empire, or for",53
NA,"themselves, ever to have done that. I do not",53
NA,believe they would do it.,53
NA,Mr Davis -Thei r leader would have,53
NA,done so.,53
Mr BEALE ,Mayb e he would. I say,53
NA,in conclusion that we will do our utmost,53
NA,and play our part to the limit of Australia's,53
NA,"capacity to bring about some sort, of proper",53
NA,working agreement in the matter of thermo-,53
NA,"nuclear and nuclear tests, but that",53
NA,in the meantime we intend to go,53
NA,ahead and. subject to complete safety,53
NA,"for the Australian people, which we",53
NA,"have achieved and will continue to achieve,",53
NA,"assist Great Britain, ourselves, and our allies",53
NA,in the conducting of these tests.,53

The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! There is,54

NA,hardly hear the honorable member for,54
NA,Moore.,54
NA,Mr Bryant -W e do not want to hear,54

The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,54

NA,"better be quiet, or he will find himself out-",54
NA,"side the chamber, where he will not be able",54
NA,Wheeler. R. C.,54
NA,to interject while I am speaking.,54
Mr LESLIE ,I n relation to the pro-,54
NA,"posed vole for Miscellaneous Services alone,",54
NA,there are many matters that I should like,54
NA,to discuss and which I think the committee,54
NA,PAIRS.,54
NA,should consider. Most of the proposed,54
NA,voles in this group refer to grants and assist-,54
NA,ance to be given by the Government in,54
NA,respect of activities both inside and outside,54
NA,"Australia, including the very important",54
NA,"Chaney, F. C.",54
NA,measure of assistance which the Govern-,54
NA,ment has undertaken to give to our Asian,54
NA,friends under the Colombo plan. I wish to,54
NA,devote a few minutes to discussion of,54
NA,"assistance within Australia, because I am one",54
NA,of those peculiar people who believe that,54
NA,"charity begins at home and that, whilst it is",55
NA,proper to have a charitable and kindly,55
NA,attitude to people outside Australia who,55
NA,"require assistance, we should make sure that",55
NA,the fullest possible measure of assistance is,55
NA,given in deserving cases at home.,55
NA,In Division 214 of the Estimates for the,55
NA,"Prime Minister's Department, under the",55
NA,"heading of Miscellaneous Services, a long",55
NA,list of organizations and subjects appears for,55
NA,which money is to be made available. Some,55
NA,of these appear to receive their grants,55
NA,"almost automatically each year, and it is not",55
NA,often that a new organization or subject,55
NA,"appears in the list. However, this year, I",55
NA,"notice that a new organization is included,",55
NA,the Australian Humanities Research Coun-,55
NA,"cil. Although, as in the case of the other",55
NA,".**ems in this division, the title of this",55
NA,"organization is given, no information is pro-",55
NA,vided to enable the committee to under-,55
NA,stand what this organization is and what it,55
NA,"does. Having regard to its tide, I have",55
NA,no doubt that it devotes its attention to,55
NA,"humanitarian activities, and is a deserving",55
NA,"body. However, I should appreciate some",55
NA,information as to its objectives.,55
NA,"Another item is, "" Cultural matters,",55
NA,"exhibitions"", and the grant for this is",55
NA,"£1,500. A similar vote was included in last",55
NA,"year's Estimates, but it was not spent.",55
NA,"Evidently, the exhibitions did not take place,",55
NA,but it is assumed that they will be held this,55
NA,year. Although the causes listed in this,55
NA,"division may merit financial help, I could",55
NA,"mention many others which are equally, if",55
NA,"not more, deserving of government assis-",55
NA,tance.,55
NA,I direct particular attention to the work,55
NA,that is being carried on by voluntary,55
NA,organizations in every State of the Common-,55
NA,wealth to provide medical and educational,55
NA,facilities for spastic children. These children,55
NA,"are afflicted with cerebral palsy, and the",55
NA,efforts of these organizations are devoted to,55
NA,"the improvement of their physical condition,",55
NA,and to the provision of means of education,55
NA,so that they may be able to enjoy their lives,55
NA,as much as possible and to engage in useful,55
NA,occupations as far as they are able. The,55
NA,demands that have been made for the ser-,55
NA,"vices of these organizations, even in the",55
NA,"short time that they have been in existence,",55
NA,"have been overwhelming, and they will not",55
NA,be able to carry on without some assistance,55
NA,from the Commonwealth Government.,55
NA,The organizations have formed a federal,55
NA,"association, and at a recent meeting in",55
NA,"Melbourne, after a very careful study of",55
NA,"the position, it was found that in order to",55
NA,provide adequately the services necessary to,55
NA,assist spastic children both now and in later,55
NA,"life a sum of £400,000 would be required",55
NA,to supplement the funds raised from the,55
NA,public and voted by State governments.,55
NA,Last year an appeal for assistance was made,55
NA,"to the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden), but",55
NA,although he gave a sympathetic hearing he,55
NA,gave no substantial help. The organizations,55
NA,had hoped to receive some assistance in this,55
NA,"year's budget, but such has not been the",55
NA,case. The time is fast approaching when,55
NA,the Commonwealth will not be able to keep,55
NA,"out of this matter, if only for economic",55
NA,"reasons, which is a most inhumane way of",55
NA,considering it. But if the Commonwealth,55
NA,does not give financial assistance in the,55
NA,"work of helping spastic children, it will",55
NA,"be obliged, under its social services legisla-",55
NA,"tion, to pay them the invalid pension when",55
NA,they are old enough to qualify for it.,55
NA,Mr Ian Allan -Wha t are the State go-,55
NA,vernments doing?,55
Mr LESLIE ,Th e State governments,55
NA,are giving financial assistance in accordance,55
NA,with their constitutional responsibilities.,55
NA,"They provide educational facilities, and the",55
NA,State of Queensland subsidizes the spastic,55
NA,centre in that State on a £l-for-£I basis.,55
NA,"Nevertheless, the financial assistance from",55
NA,"the State governments is inadequate, and",55
NA,the organizations have to depend upon,55
NA,money raised from the public to enable,55
NA,"them to carry on. In Western Australia,",55
NA,"where it costs £60,000 a year to run the",55
NA,"spastic centre, the organization has received",55
NA,generous support from the State govern-,55
NA,ment. The difference between the govern-,55
NA,ment grant and the actual cost is con-,55
NA,"tributed, voluntarily, by the public. The",55
NA,Australian council of the spastic organiza-,55
NA,tions is fearful that the sympathetic and,55
NA,generous response by the public to the fre-,55
NA,"quent appeals will not be maintained, so",55
NA,that it will not be possible to provide the,55
NA,services that the spastic children need.,55
NA,"Already, it is impossible to provide any-",55
NA,thing like the services asked for.,55
NA,Although this need has been ignored,55
NA,"through the years by governments, the ser-",55
NA,vice now being given by the spastic orga-,55
NA,nizations is being sought by iricreasins num-,55
NA,bers of parents whose children are afflicted.,55
NA,"1. say agam that charity begins at home, and",56
NA,this is a case in which the Government,56
NA,should assist. I i children can receive treat-,56
NA,ment in their early years it is possible to do,56
NA,much more for them than in later years.,56
NA,From a humanitarian point of view the need,56
NA,of the spastic children constitutes a demand,56
NA,for government assistance that far tran-,56
NA,scends the claims of many of the organiza-,56
NA,tions listed in this division to which grants,56
NA,"have been made. I hope that, as a result",56
NA,"of my appeal, some consideration will be",56
NA,"given ro the help of spastic organizations,",56
NA,and that when they approach the Treasurer,56
NA,later this year he will give them substance,56
NA,"as well as sympathy, and grant them a fair",56
NA,"proportion of the £16,000,000 that is set",56
NA,aside for him to spend at his discretion.,56
NA,1 now turn to a matter under the control,56
NA,of the Postmaster-General-th e operations,56
NA,of the Australian Broadcasting Commission.,56
NA,"On previous occasions, I have severely",56
NA,criticized a recent departure in the pro-,56
NA,grammes of the Australian Broadcasting,56
NA,Commission by providing only one service,56
NA,"in the children's hour, that is, the relay from",56
NA,the eastern States to Western Australia of,56
NA,the Argonauts session. When I discussed,56
NA,"this matter with Mr Moses, the general",56
NA,manager of the Australian Broadcasting,56
NA,"Commission, he gave me quite a long story,",56
NA,but to me it was unconvincing and left me,56
NA,cold. I am still of the opinion that Western,56
NA,Australia is not being provided with an ade-,56
NA,"quate programme for children, and it seems",56
NA,that requests to the Australian Broadcasting,56
NA,Commission from Western Australia will,56
NA,not receive favorable consideration.,56
NA,As proof of that statement I point to the,56
NA,fact that the Royal Show is now taking,56
NA,"place at Perth, and the Australian Broad-",56
NA,casting Commission is conspicuous by its,56
NA,absence. At the Royal Show held in each,56
NA,of the capital cities of the eastern States,56
NA,the team which presents the Argonauts ses-,56
NA,sion appears in person at the specially pro-,56
NA,vided Australian Broadcasting Commission,56
NA,studio in one of the pavilions. Many,56
NA,Western Australian children who listen to,56
NA,the broadcast of the Argonauts session were,56
NA,keenly looking forward to the appearance,56
NA,of these artists at the Perth Royal Show,56
NA,"this year, but they were bitterly dis-",56
NA,appointed. Why should Western Australia,56
NA,be deprived of a personal visit from these,56
NA,"artists? Obviously, it is a case of a distant",56
NA,State being forgotten and neglected.,56
NA,Mr Dab/ -Wher e is Western Australia?,56
Mr LESLIE , I suggest that the honor-,56
NA,able member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly),56
NA,should go back to the kindergarten and,56
NA,learn where Western Australia is. The,56
NA,treatment that has been meted out by the,56
NA,Australian Broadcasting Commission to,56
NA,Western Australia is wholly unsatisfactory.,56
NA,I suggest that the commission should again,56
NA,look at the matter. I f the idea behind the,56
NA,relaying of a single session all over the,56
NA,Commonwealth is that it is to prepare the-,56
NA,"way for television, I remind the commis-",56
NA,sion that we will not have television in,56
NA,Western Australia for another two or per-,56
NA,haps three years.,56
NA,Mr Luchetti -Bu t you are paying taxes.,56
Mr LESLIE ,"O f course, we will be",56
NA,taxed. If the children at the eastern end,56
NA,of the Commonwealth are to have the bene-,56
NA,fits of television and there is to be another,56
NA,"programme for Western Australia, South",56
NA,"Australia and Queensland, which States will",56
NA,"not have television for a considerable time,",56
NA,each State might as well be given its own,56
NA,broadcast children's session at the present,56
NA,time. When the Argonauts session was-,56
NA,"run by each State, it was not possible for",56
NA,the stations to cope with the mail that came,56
NA,from the children. The interest of the,56
NA,"children in their local affairs, and in the",56
NA,"flora and fauna of their country, was such",56
NA,that the stations could not deal with the,56
NA,mail. How in the world those who are,56
NA,responsible are able to deal with the mail,56
NA,since the session was placed on a nation-,56
NA,wide basis I do not know. The discon-,56
NA,tinuance of the session in Western Aus-,56
NA,tralia has been very disappointing to the,56
NA,children. I know that the Postmaster-,56
NA,General will tell me that he has no control,56
NA,over the programmes of the Australian,56
NA,"Broadcasting Commission, but he should",56
NA,investigate this matter. I suggest that the,56
NA,"Argonauts session, even if it costs three",56
NA,"times as much, is worth a jolly sight more",56
NA,than is the broadcast of the proceedings of,56
NA,this Parliament. I remind honorable mem-,56
NA,bers-an d I include myself-tha t as 1,56
NA,stand here and speak the broadcast of these,56
NA,"proceedings is costing the taxpayers ot""",56
NA,"Australia £2 5s. a minute. I believe that, as",56
NA,"far as I am concerned, they get value for",56
NA,"their money, but I am not so sure that that",56
NA,applies to a number of other honorable,56
NA,members.,56
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,57
NA,able member's time has expired.,57
Mr COSTA ,Banks) [8.53] - I desire,57
NA,comment upon the Estimates for the Postbe,57
NA,"master-General's Department, and to refer",57
NA,to the proposal to instal what is known as,57
NA,the teleprinter reperforator electric switchassociated,57
NA,"ing system, the abbreviated name of which",57
NA,Tress. The installation of this equipment,57
NA,would mean a reorganization of the telethe,57
NA,graph branches in Australia. The Postunions,57
NA,"master-General ( Mr Davidson), in reply to",57
NA,"a question that I asked him, stated that",57
NA,installation of the system would improve,57
NA,the grade of service and effect substantial,57
NA,economies in telegraph operating costs.,57
NA,"estimated cost of Tress, which would serve",57
NA,"568 offices in Australia, is £720,000.",57
NA,Representatives of the telegraphists,57
NA,the supervisory officers' organization have,57
NA,conferred with the Postmaster-General on,57
NA,this matter and have also placed some,57
NA,their views before me. The unions conregard,57
NA,cerned are opposed to the installation,57
NA,this system. They doubt its efficiency and,57
NA,also its ability to effect economies within,57
NA,the service. That opinion is shared by all,57
NA,"the operatives in the telegraph branches,",57
NA,including the supervisory officers and the,57
NA,supervising technicians. The department is,57
NA,basing its argument for the installation,57
NA,Tress on the experience of the Western,57
NA,"Union Telegraph Co., in the United States",57
NA,"of America. As honorable members know,",57
NA,the postal service in Amenca is conducted,57
NA,by private enterprise and is not run by,57
NA,the government. The reported cost of the,57
NA,installation of this system in the United,57
NA,"States was 70,000,000 dollars, or approximultiplex",57
NA,"mately £A30,000,000. Moreover, there",57
NA,have been additional heavy annual approof,57
NA,priations for the maintenance of the,57
NA,original equipment and for extension of the,57
NA,service. The department's estimate of,57
NA,"approximately £720,000 is relatively low",57
NA,comparison with the cost to the Western,57
NA,Union Telegraph Company of America. I,57
NA,feel that the cost of installing co-axial,57
NA,cables has not been taken into account,57
NA,"the department's estimate, and also that",57
NA,system would not work satisfactorily in,57
NA,Australia without superior circuits such,57
NA,would be provided by the use of co-axial,57
NA,cable. i,57
NA,"The Postmaster-General, in reply to",57
NA,"another question of mine, has stated that",57
NA,the new system would require 400 fewer,57
NA,"to telegraphists, which means that it would",57
NA,necessary to effect a retrenchment of,57
NA,"telegraphists. On the other hand, because",57
NA,of the vast amount of mechanization that is,57
NA,"with it, introduction of the",57
NA,is system would lead to a greatly increased,57
NA,engineering staff. Because of the fear of,57
NA,"retrenchment of telegraphists, the",57
NA,are asking for the exercise of,57
NA,caution in the installation of this system.,57
NA,The argument that Tress is the answer to,57
NA,telegraph service economy difficulties is not,57
NA,"strengthened by the fact that, apart from",57
NA,"The America, where the system has been in",57
NA,"operation for years, no other country, large",57
NA,"or small, has adopted the Tress system.",57
NA,"If it had been proved to be efficient, such",57
NA,"and coutries as England, Germany and France",57
NA,undoubtedly would have adopted it. Those,57
NA,countries use what is called the magic eye,57
NA,"of system, and the Australian postal unions",57
NA,that system as being more suitable to,57
NA,of Australian conditions. They believe it,57
NA,would be more efficient and more economic.,57
NA,The Postal Department owes it to the tax-,57
NA,payers to be careful in its investigations,57
NA,before it spends a lot of money on a new-,57
NA,fangled system which is of doubtful quality.,57
NA,"In the past, experimenting engineers have",57
NA,of introduced other systems that have proved,57
NA,"to be a failure. For example, they installed",57
NA,the Hunter Valley multiplex system. Twenty-,57
NA,three towns in the Hunter Valley area of,57
NA,"New South Wales, including the Maitland",57
NA,"and Cessnock districts, which previously",57
NA,were grouped on a four or five manual cir-,57
NA,"cuit, were changed over to the mechanized",57
NA,system. Many technical break-,57
NA,downs and a heavy annual maintenance cost,57
NA,"about £6,000 convinced the department",57
NA,that the system was inefficient and was a,57
NA,"costly failure. Consequently, it reverted to",57
NA,the old morse system. The introduction of,57
NA,in Tress could lead to the same result. Multi-,57
NA,"plex, Tress and such highly mechanized",57
NA,systems are suitable only for densely popu-,57
NA,lated areas. They are suitable for big cities,57
NA,in or towns that are comparatively close to-,57
NA,"the gether. In those circumstances, the laying",57
NA,of co-axial cable would not be so expensive.,57
NA,as Let us take Queensland as an example.,57
NA,During monsoonal and bad weather periods,57
NA,the carrier wave frequency circuits react in,57
NA,"a manner that is known as bumping, which",57
NA,is like the static faults that we hear in our,58
NA,wireless sets. This so-called technical,58
NA,"bumping fault could last for days, and in",58
NA,that case the present system would have to be,58
NA,resorted to. The same criticism applies to,58
NA,communications in the southern States in,58
NA,"summer, especially during stormy weather",58
NA,when there is a contraction of lines due to,58
NA,varying temperatures.,58
NA,The high speed and intricate system of follows:-,58
NA,Tress will be unreliable unless a costly,58
NA,reorganization of circuits is carried out. ln,58
NA,"respect of efficiency, which is one of the Western",58
NA,aims of the Postal Department and which railroad,58
NA,"its experts claim Tress will achieve, the traffic.",58
NA,unions dispute the claim that efficiency will,58
NA,be improved. The essence of a telegram is,58
NA,speed and accuracy. A telegram is usually,58
NA,an urgent message sent from one point,58
NA,"another, that is from the dispatching office",58
NA,to the receiving office. Telegrams are,58
NA,present transmitted by the teletype or,58
NA,"the hand Morse system, and it takes no more",58
NA,than about a minute to send the average,58
NA,message. The installation of a new and,58
NA,costly system to increase that speed will,58
NA,be of much value because the transmission,58
NA,of a telegram at present is almost instannot,58
NA,"taneous. What is necessary, however, is",58
NA,the message should be speeded up from the,58
NA,office of destination to the addressee. an-J,58
NA,that is a matter of speeding up delivery.,58
NA,What is the value of transmitting a cable,58
NA,"from London to Sydney, or to Canberra,",58
NA,a fast speed if that cable is going to,58
NA,about in an office for one or two hours,58
NA,waiting to be delivered by a messenger?,58
NA,And that sort of thing does happen. My,58
NA,advice to the Postmaster-General is that,58
NA,should forget about Tress and concentrate,58
NA,on speeding up the delivery of telegrams.,58
NA,Another matter that is causing some,58
NA,cern to the telegraphists union is whether,58
NA,the new system is to be operated by males,58
NA,or females. The Postmaster-General,58
NA,stated that the positions have not yet been,58
NA,classified and that the system can be,58
NA,operated by either males or females. I do,58
NA,not dispute the rights of females to get,58
NA,"job anywhere, but the unions object to the",58
NA,employment of females on the grounds that,58
NA,they are not paid the full male rate. In,58
NA,"fact, they receive only 75 per cent, of",58
NA,male wage. The union has no objection,58
NA,"to their employment at male rates of pay,",58
NA,"but it fear:, that the introduction of this",58
NA,svstem may threaten male employment. of,58
NA,The Posial Department is apparently rely-,58
NA,ing on reports of savings made by the,58
NA,Western Union Telegraph Company in the,58
NA,United States of America. It is under-,58
NA,stood that that company has saved,58
NA,"17,000,000 dollars a year since it introduced",58
NA,"Tress. However, as I said in my opening",58
NA,"remarks, these economies are doubted. The",58
NA,""" A.C.A. News"". published in the United",58
NA,"States, has reported about the system as",58
NA,"From 1943 to 1953, that is in ten years, the",58
NA,"Union closed 1,012 main and telegraph",58
NA,"branch offices, 3,202 agency ollices, and 3,666",58
NA,offices were also closed for telegraph,58
NA,"The "" A.C.A. News"" quoted those",58
NA,figures as they were given in evidence be-,58
NA,to fore the United States Federal Communi-,58
NA,cations Commission. Thefigureswere used,58
NA,at to expose the fantastic scandal in which,58
NA,by thousands of communities throughout the,58
NA,United States have been deprived of direct,58
NA,telegraph services in direct violation of firm,58
NA,pledges made to the American Government,58
NA,not by the Western Union company. Savings,58
NA,at the expense of the public service should,58
NA,"be tolerated, and that is apparently",58
NA,that what occurred under this system in the,58
NA,"United States. Perhaps, it will occur here.",58
NA,"The morse system has proved itself, and our",58
NA,other systems have proved themselves and,58
NA,"are still very useful. Therefore, the Postal",58
NA,at Department should concentrate not on the,58
NA,lie introduction of a new system but on the,58
NA,speeding up of the delivery of telegrams.,58
NA,The department may have the development,58
NA,of television in mind when considering this,58
NA,he system and may intend laying co-axial,58
NA,cables to retransmit television programmes,58
NA,beyond the 25-mile radius. If it has that,58
NA,in mind in connexion with Tress there,58
NA,"conmay be some substance in its arguments,",58
NA,but these cables are very expensive and I,58
NA,am sure that the Postmaster-General has,58
NA,has not taken the expense into account.,58
NA,The unions oppose the introduction of,58
NA,"this system on several grounds, the grounds",58
NA,"a being the high cost of installation, unsuit-",58
NA,"ability under Australian conditions, lack of",58
NA,"justification from a traffic viewpoint, desira-",58
NA,bility of further investigation with a view,58
NA,"the to a more suitable system, lack of con-",58
NA,vincing argument that any appreciable im-,58
NA,provement in service or saving of costs,58
NA,"new will result, no saving of time in delivery",58
NA,"tCii^rams, ihe departmental assertion that",58
NA,"-400 telegraphists will be retrenched, the",59
NA,of departmental assurance that the proposed,59
NA,system will be operated by males and the,59
NA,general departmental tendency towards,59
NA,panic mechanization at any cost. The de-,59
NA,partmental attitude in this matter is com-,59
NA,pletely wrong and it may involve the,59
NA,department in the installation of a system,59
NA,which will fail to achieve the results ex-,59
NA,pected of it.,59
Mr ERWIN ,Ballarat) [9.7] - I desire to,59
NA,direct my remarks to-night to the Com-,59
NA,monwealth railways. I congratulate the,59
NA,Minister for Shipping and Transport (Sena-,59
NA,tor Paltridge) and the Commonwealth Com-,59
NA,"missioner for Railways, Mr Hannaberry, on",59
NA,the very fine job of work they have done in,59
NA,bringing the Commonwealth railways to,59
NA,"their present high standard of efficiency,",59
NA,which is as high a standard as any to be,59
NA,found in the world. This year the Com-,59
NA,monwealth railways made a profit of about,59
NA,"£1,500,000, and that was achieved because",59
NA,-of the introduction of diesel-electric loco-,59
NA,motives. The first of these locomotives was,59
NA,"brought into service about four years ago,",59
NA,and during the last four years we have had,59
NA,to re-adjust our thinking about railway sys-,59
NA,"tems as a fast, efficient and economical",59
NA,means of transport.,59
NA,Diesel-electric trains are able to operate,59
NA,at less than one-third the cost of the,59
NA,"steam trains, and, at the same time, give",59
NA,"""faster service. Let us now look at the",59
NA,of Australia and trace out where Commonstandard,59
NA,wealth services operate. They operate from,59
NA,"Port Pirie north to Port Augusta, thence",59
NA,"Kalgoorlie, a distance of approximately",59
NA,"1,100 miles. That service is known as",59
NA,""" trans "" service. Our central railway line",59
NA,commences at Port Augusta and runs north,59
NA,to Alice Springs. Then there is a large gap,59
NA,across the centre of Australia to Birdum;,59
NA,and from Birdum to Darwin there is,59
NA,3 ft. 6 in. gauge railway. The present,59
NA,vernment has commenced the conversion,59
NA,the line from 3 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. 8± in,59
NA,which is the world standard gauge-fro,59
NA,Port Augusta for about 200 miles north;,59
NA,"and as our economic conditions permit,",59
NA,we shall eventually have a world standard,59
NA,gauge line of 4 ft. 8 i in. through to Darwin.,59
NA,In view of the comparatively small volume,59
NA,of goods carried and the unbalance of,59
NA,goods traffic-ther e being a greater volume,59
NA,-of goods taken west than is carried east-,59
NA,lack the profit made by the Commonwealth rail-,59
NA,ways is remarkable. If the timber industry,59
NA,"of Western Australia could be developed,",59
NA,"that profit could be increased considerably,",59
NA,because a good deal of timber would be,59
NA,carried from the west to the east. So much,59
NA,for the Commonwealth railways.,59
NA,Let us glance at the States' railway,59
NA,systems to see whether they could be greatly,59
NA,"improved, to the advantage of the economy",59
NA,"of the country. From Brisbane, in the",59
NA,"north, there is a standard gauge line to",59
NA,"Albury, via Sydney. Another standard",59
NA,gauge line runs from Sydney to Broken,59
NA,"HiU, where there is a break of gauge. From",59
NA,"Broken Hill to Port Pirie, a distance of",59
NA,"approximately 240 miles, there is a 3-ft.",59
NA,6-in. gauge line. But for that gap of 240,59
NA,"miles, we could operate a through railway",59
NA,service from Sydney to Kalgoorlie. If the,59
NA,line between Broken Hill and Port Pirie,59
NA,"were converted to the standard gauge, goods",59
NA,could be carried by rail from Brisbane to,59
NA,"Kalgoorlie, without being unloaded at any",59
NA,intermediate point. If the line from Kal-,59
NA,goorlie to Perth were converted to the,59
NA,"standard gauge, we should have a true",59
NA,trans-Australia railway.,59
NA,Let us consider for a few minutes a rail-,59
NA,"way service which, I am sure, would return",59
NA,a handsome profit after gauge standardiza-,59
NA,old tion. I refer to the service between Mel-,59
NA,a bourne and Sydney. The line from Albury,59
NA,map to Melbourne could be converted to the,59
NA,gauge and modern central traffic,59
NA,control systems could be introduced at a,59
NA,"to total cost of £9,000,000. I understand that",59
NA,the conversion could be done without inter-,59
NA,the fering in any way with the operations of,59
NA,"the railway system, of Victoria. The scheme",59
NA,proposed in the Clapp report would have,59
NA,"cost something like £76,000,000 at the time",59
NA,"the report was published, and to-day it",59
NA,"a would cost about £200,000,000. That was",59
NA,Goa scheme for the standardization of all the,59
NA,"of railway systems of the Commonwealth, but",59
NA,- I feel that at this stage it would not be,59
NA,m necessary to go so far. We must crawl,59
NA,"before we walk. This is a young country,",59
NA,and we must make do with what we can,59
NA,afford. I believe that the cost of convert-,59
NA,ing the line from Albury to Melbourne to,59
NA,standard gauge would have to be borne,59
NA,"the by the Commonwealth, owing to the finan-",59
NA,cial difficulties of Victoria. The job could,59
NA,not be completed in less than three years.,59
NA,"so a nominal sum of £3,000,000 a year",60
NA,could be allocated for the purpose. I f there,60
NA,"-are any men unemployed in Australia, their",60
NA,-services could be used usefully on the con-,60
NA,struction of such a railway line.,60
NA,The question that we must ask ourselves,60
NA,iis: Can our railways be brought to such,60
NA,a standard of efficiency as to alleviate,60
NA,severity of some of our road problems? 1,60
NA,say most definitely that that can be done.,60
NA,The Hume Highway between Melbourne,60
NA,"and Sydney, to take one example, is",60
NA,quagmire in places. Millions of pounds matters,60
NA,have been spent on the construction and,60
NA,"maintenance of that road, but the money",60
NA,spent on it in the last nnanciai year at,60
NA,"rate has been spent unwisely. At present,",60
NA,300 vehicles each carrying an average load,60
NA,of 12 tons travel over the road each,60
NA,"So 24,000 tons of goods are carried over",60
NA,it each week. Those figures show that our,60
NA,"bituminized roads, in their present form,",60
NA,cannot possibly stand up to the great,60
NA,volume of traffic that uses them. Many of,60
NA,-us believe that if there were a standardyears,60
NA,gauge railway between Sydney and MelCommonwealth,60
NA,"-bourne, a great portion of the volume of",60
NA,goods now being carried by road between,60
NA,those two cities would be diverted to the,60
NA,"railway, but the loss of time and the expense",60
NA,caused by the break of gauge at Albury,60
NA,such that the railways are unable to compete,60
NA,effectively with the road-hauliers. Although,60
NA,"almost 80 per cent, of the goods carried",60
NA,between Melbourne and Adelaide is carried,60
NA,"by the railways and only 20 per cent, goes",60
NA,"try road, road-hauliers are carrying almost",60
NA,"60 per cent, of the goods traffic between",60
NA,Melbourne and Sydney. The success of the,60
NA,railway between Adelaide and Melbourne,60
NA,is an indication of what would happen if from 1st October.,60
NA,we built a standard-gauge line from Mel-,60
NA,bourne to Albury. The cost of carrying,60
NA,goods between Melbourne and Sydney by,60
NA,rail would be less than l i d . a ton-mile.,60
NA,Compare that with the charge of 4d. a tonare,60
NA,mile made at present by road-hauliers.,60
NA,I believe that our population now is suffioutback,60
NA,ciently large to warrant the establishment,60
NA,of three more States. Two of our mair.,60
NA,problems at present are roads and decenthe,60
NA,tralization. If a deep-sea port were estabby,60
NA,lished at Portland to serve a new State,60
NA,sisting of a part of the west of Victoria,60
NA,"a part of South Australia, if another",60
NA,sea port were established at Eden to serve,60
NA,another new State taking in the surrounding,60
NA,"area, and if another deep-sea port were",60
NA,estabhshed at lluka to serve another new,60
NA,"State consisting of the New England district,",60
NA,many of our transport difficulties would be,60
NA,"alleviated. With an efficient railway system,",60
NA,less money would be spent on main high-,60
NA,ways and more money would be available,60
NA,"the to town, borough and shire councils.",60
NA,Mr H. V. JOHNSON (Kalgoorlie) [9.19].,60
NA,"-I n the limited time at my disposal, I",60
NA,a shall confine my remarks tb one or two,60
NA,of great importance to my electorate;.,60
NA,"First, I wish to congratulate the honorable",60
NA,"member for Ballarat ( Mr Erwin), because",60
NA,any it is refreshing to hear members of the,60
NA,Commonwealth Parliament give credit,60
NA,where it is due by eulogizing the work of,60
NA,"day. the Commonwealth railways, which have",60
NA,"done a magnificent job for this country, par-",60
NA,"ticularly under the present commissioner,",60
NA,"Mr Hannaberry, whose services to the",60
NA,nation have won him the admiration of,60
NA,people of all political opinions. In the few,60
NA,in which he has been in charge of the,60
NA,railways he has done such,60
NA,a magnificent job that the deficiencies of,60
NA,"the past have vanished, and it is now a",60
NA,thorough pleasure to travel by those rail-,60
NA,"ways. I am very happy, therefore, that the",60
NA,is honorable member for Ballarat saw fit to,60
NA,praise the great services of Mr Hannaberry.,60
NA,If I had time I could deal with the Com-,60
NA,"monwealth railways much more fully, but",60
NA,because there are other matters of great,60
NA,import that I wish to deal with I am unable,60
NA,to give the time that I would like to give,60
NA,to a discussion of those railway services.,60
NA,"I refer to the increased postal, telephone",60
NA,and telegraph charges which have operated,60
NA,These increases impose a great additional,60
NA,burden on the people who form the pioneer-,60
NA,ing section of our great community. They,60
NA,"the people who live far from the cities,",60
NA,and who do not enjoy the advantage of,60
NA,the amenities available to city people. These,60
NA,dwellers are greatly victimized by,60
NA,the new impositions. People who live in,60
NA,the far-out parts of Australia have to do,60
NA,major portion of their business dealings,60
NA,either telephone or telegram. Conse-,60
NA,"conquently, increases of telephone and tele-",60
NA,and graph charges have a more direct effect on,60
NA,deepthem than they have on other members of,60
NA,the public. I refer particularly to people,60
NA,who Hve in the north-west of Western Aus-.,61
NA,tralia and in the Murchison and Murchison,61
NA,East gold-fields districts. I appeal to the,61
NA,Postmaster-General ( Mr Davidson) on their,61
NA,"behalf but, while doing so, I realize quite",61
NA,"well that, although the Minister may be",61
NA,"sympathetic in the matter, he is just one",61
NA,member of a government which makes,61
NA,decisions such as that to increase postal,61
NA,"and other charges and that, as a result,",61
NA,irrespective of what kind of a case I may be,61
NA,"able to put to him to-night, he is not in a",61
NA,position to vary the charges as they affect,61
NA,"people who live in isolated areas. I feel,",61
NA,"therefore, that the whole thing is hardly",61
NA,"fair, because when a worthwhile case that",61
NA,merits thorough attention by the Govern-,61
NA,"ment is put forward, it is the Government's",61
NA,job to give that case the serious attention,61
NA,that it deserves.,61
NA,"As 1 have already said, the greater part",61
NA,of the business transacted by people in out-,61
NA,back areas is transacted by means of tele-,61
NA,phone or telegram. That is a circumstance,61
NA,that is peculiar to the conditions under,61
NA,which those people live and work. The,61
NA,shipping service for people living on the,61
NA,isolated sections of the Western Australian,61
NA,"coastline is irregular, and when people in",61
NA,those areas want to make arrangements for,61
NA,the transport of goods such arrangements,61
NA,are made by telephone or telegram.,61
NA,The business in these areas is not con-,61
NA,ducted in the regular fashion adopted in,61
NA,areas where there is assured and regular,61
NA,"transport, but is done irregularly because",61
NA,of the lack of regular transport services.,61
NA,Because so much business is done on the,61
NA,telephone people in those areas sometimes,61
NA,have to wait on the line while decisions are,61
NA,being made. This is an exceedingly costly,61
NA,"business normally, but now that the charges",61
NA,for trunk-line telephone calls have been in-,61
NA,creased it will be even more so. I stress,61
NA,that it is only by the use of telephones and,61
NA,telegram that people in those isolated areas,61
NA,can rsadily make contact with others. So,61
NA,I regret very much that the Government,61
NA,has found it necessary to place further im-,61
NA,"posts on these outback people, who already",61
NA,face many difiiculties quite unknown to,61
NA,people who live in the cities and larger,61
NA,towns of Australia.,61
NA,Not only are the people outback victheir,61
NA,timized in connexion with increased postal,61
NA,"and other charges, but they are also vicflowed",61
NA,timized in respect of broadcasting recep-,61
NA,tion and the rate of listener's licence fee.,61
NA,In some of the outback areas a listener gets,61
NA,very little return for the money he spends,61
NA,"on a broadcast listener's licence, because",61
NA,good reception is possible for only two or,61
NA,three hours a day. Yet those people who,61
NA,do not get the advantage of a 24-hour,61
NA,broadcasting service such as is enjoyed,61
NA,by metropolitan listeners are asked to pay,61
NA,exactly the same listener's licence fee as is,61
NA,paid by people who can use their radios at,61
NA,any time of the day or night. That is,61
NA,another injustice suffered by those people.,61
NA,"Some time ago, 1 asked the Postmaster-",61
NA,General whether he would reduce the,61
NA,listener's licence fee payable by such people,61
NA,"in isolated areas, on the ground of their",61
NA,not receiving the same standard of service,61
NA,as is received by people who live within,61
NA,effective range of numerous broadcasting,61
NA,stations.,61
NA,Now I turn to a matter that is of greai,61
NA,importance-th e question of the erection,61
NA,"of a new post office at Geraldton, in Western",61
NA,Australia. The proposed votes we are now,61
NA,considering make no provision for that,61
NA,work. I might mention that the building,61
NA,which serves Geraldton as a post office at,61
NA,"present was erected in the early 1890's,",61
NA,when the population of Geraldton was,61
NA,"about 1,000. To-day, when Geraldton's",61
NA,"population is above 10,000, and with the",61
NA,population of surrounding districts increas-,61
NA,"ing rapidly, this same post office which was",61
NA,built in the. early lS90's is still being called,61
NA,on to serve that much larger community.,61
NA,"In 1947, after a thorough inspection by",61
NA,officials of the Postmaster-General's De-,61
NA,"partment, the then Postmaster-General told",61
NA,the people of Geraldton that they would,61
NA,get a new post office. The plans were,61
NA,drawn up and submitted to the local autho-,61
NA,rities in Geraldton. A draft of the,61
NA,"proposed building was also submitted, ln",61
NA,"1949, preparations were being made for the",61
NA,"construction of the new post office but, un-",61
NA,"fortunately, the Labour Government of",61
NA,that day was defeated in the general election,61
NA,"in December, 1949. This Government then",61
NA,"took office, and the incoming Postmaster-",61
NA,"General, the honorable member for Rich-",61
NA,"mond ( Mr Anthony), voiced his sympathy",61
NA,with the people of Geraldton in respect of,61
NA,poor post office facilities. But that is,61
NA,as far as we got. Correspondence has,61
NA,backwards and forwards through the,61
NA,"years, and numerous representations have",62
NA,-been made to the Postmaster-General who,62
NA,preceded the present occupant of that hon-,62
NA,orable office. But in no way have we been,62
NA,able to get this Government to provide,62
NA,the money necessary for the erection of the,62
NA,new building. The result is that a building,62
NA,"that is about 60 years old, erected to serve",62
NA,"a community of 1,000 persons, is still",62
NA,attempting to serve a community that has,62
NA,since grown tenfold. The building is con-,62
NA,gested. It has not sufficient accommoda-,62
NA,tion for the postal officials who work in it.,62
NA,"In fact, some of the officials of that post",62
NA,office have had to be accommodated in,62
NA,State buildings because of the lack of room,62
NA,"in the post office. For instance, one of the",62
NA,most important postal officers of the dis-,62
NA,"trict, the postal inspector, has had to occupy",62
NA,accommodation in a State building. The,62
NA,State is now pressing for that accommoda-,62
NA,tion to be returned to it. So we have this,62
NA,completely inadequate post office in one,62
NA,of the' most important towns in Western,62
NA,Australia- a very important town which,62
NA,"is growing in population every day, and",62
NA,whose activities in agriculture and secon-,62
NA,dary industry are continually expanding.,62
NA,Yet over the years this Government has,62
NA,failed to give the people of Geraldton and,62
NA,the surrounding districts the adequate ser-,62
NA,vice that they so rightly deserve. I have,62
NA,discussed this matter with the present Post-,62
NA,"m.ister-Gcncr?.l, and he loo has expressed",62
NA,his sympathy for the people of Geraldton,62
NA,in respect of this matter. He has said that,62
NA,he would like to see Geraldton have a new,62
NA,"post office, but has also said that the only",62
NA,thing preventing the provision of that new,62
NA,post office is sufficient money to do the job.,62
NA,The Estimates provide for the expenditure,62
NA,"of more than £310,000 on new buildings",62
NA,and works in Western Australia that were,62
NA,not mentioned in the Estimates three or,62
NA,four years ago. The new Geraldton post,62
NA,office was supposed to have priority over,62
NA,"other works, but it has been discarded and",62
NA,"£310,000 is to be spent mainly in the Perth",62
NA,metropolitan area and the south-west of the,62
NA,State.,62
NA,Only a few weeks ago I was deputed by,62
NA,the Postmaster-General to open a new post,62
NA,office at Morawa. When I undertook to,62
NA,perform the ceremony of officially opening,62
NA,"that very valuable post office, I did not",62
NA,know that it would coincide with a visit to,62
NA,Western Australia by the Postmaster-,62
NA,General and the Director-General of Posts,62
NA,"and Telegraphs, Sir Giles Chippindall. Had",62
NA,"I known that, I should have thought it",62
NA,would be the Postmaster-General's job to,62
NA,open the new Morawa post office. It would,62
NA,have done him good to get out into the,62
NA,back country and see the conditions in,62
NA,which people in the country work. I think,62
NA,"that, had we got the Minister to Morawa.",62
NA,"which is fairly close to Geraldton, we",62
NA,should have had every chance of getting,62
NA,him to visit that town. I am sure he would,62
NA,have met with a very good reception had,62
NA,"he attended a civic function at Morawa,",62
NA,and that the local people would have had,62
NA,something pertinent to say to him. I was,62
NA,"very disappointed to find, when 1 was al",62
NA,"Morawa, that the Postmaster-General and",62
NA,the Director-General of Posts and Tele-,62
NA,graphs were en route to the southern part,62
NA,"of the State around Perth, the famed beauty",62
NA,of which attracts many tourists from the,62
NA,"eastern Slates, most of whom go to Perth.",62
NA,"I do not wish to be parochial, but, having",62
NA,"examined the Estimates, I think it is signifi-",62
NA,"cant that all of this £310,000 will be spent",62
NA,on buildings and works in electorates that,62
NA,that are represented by Government sup-,62
NA,porters. T do not like that.,62
NA,The Estiniates also provide approximately,62
NA,"£1,500,000 more than last year for broad-",62
NA,casting and television services. It is safe,62
NA,to say that most of this amount will be spent,62
NA,"on television, which will be of no benefit to",62
NA,people who live outside the metropolitan,62
NA,"areas. It will not benefit country people,",62
NA,but they will pay just as heavily for it in,62
NA,taxation as will people who live within a,62
NA,short distance of television broadcasting,62
NA,stations and are able to derive great advan-,62
NA,"tage from it. I am disappointed at this, and",62
NA,I appeal to the Postmaster-General to,62
NA,acknowledge the justice of the case that I,62
NA,have put before him this evening. I appeal,62
NA,to him to give consideration to people who,62
NA,are deserving of it and who will pay heavily,62
NA,to meet the increased charges to be levied,62
NA,on them. This Government has talked of,62
NA,decentralization.,62
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The honor-,62
NA,able member's time has expired.,62
NA,NA,62
NA,wish to discuss two subjects which are,62
NA,covered by the group of estimates now,62
NA,under consideration. The first relates to,62
NA,the Postmaster-General's Department. I,62
NA,want to take a somewhat unusual course-,63
NA,"at least, it appears to be unusual this",63
NA,ing-an d congratulate the Postmasterall,63
NA,General ( Mr Davidson) on the work,63
NA,done since he took over his portfolio. He,63
NA,"has experienced a rather difficult period,",63
NA,but 1 am sure that the time immediately,63
NA,ahead will be a time of great advancement,63
NA,for the postal services. Perhaps that will,63
NA,be some encouragement to the honorable,63
NA,member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr H. V. Johnson).,63
NA,I want to congratulate the Minister partralia,63
NA,ticularly upon the recognition he has,63
NA,already given to Australia's amateur radio,63
NA,"broadcasters, or bams as they are called.",63
NA,He has extended them considerable symcomradeship,63
NA,pathy and has recognized their problems,63
NA,and difficulties. His sympathetic considerawork,63
NA,tion of their problems is a very fine,63
NA,to them. The Minister has allowed them,63
NA,"to continue with television experiments,",63
NA,to extend their work with mobile equipof,63
NA,"ment, and has tried to get the co-operation",63
NA,of the public and the State governments,63
NA,a campaign to have suppressors fitted,63
NA,appliances and machinery to prevent interin,63
NA,ference to radio and television broadcasts.,63
NA,This will be of considerable help to ham,63
NA,"radio operators in Australia, and they thank",63
NA,the Postmaster-General for his sympathy,63
NA,and understanding.,63
NA,1 feel that we pay too little tribute,63
NA,to Australia's amateur radio operators.,63
NA,Although their work may be classed as,63
NA,"hobby, and a very interesting one, which",63
NA,"keeps them deeply engrossed, we should,",63
NA,"nevertheless, acknowledge the vital part they",63
NA,play. We too often pass lightly over the,63
NA,"valuable work done by them, particularly",63
NA,in time of emergency. Disastrous though,63
NA,"the recent floods have been, they would",63
NA,have been much worse had it not,63
NA,"the work of the amateur radio operators,",63
NA,who struggled against great obstacles to,63
NA,maintain vital communications between,63
NA,flooded areas and other parts of the,63
NA,try. Fine work was done not only by appliances,63
NA,"the operators in the devastated areas,",63
NA,"also by those in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide",63
NA,and elsewhere who picked up messages,63
NA,and transmitted them by telephone to the,63
NA,authorities. It is on record that many,63
NA,the operator* of amateur radio stations gave,63
NA,"up their normal work, at considerable",63
NA,"sonal expense, and devoted themselves",63
NA,solely to the task they felt they had to,63
NA,for their fellow men in time of disaster.,63
NA,We have the comforting assurance that,63
NA,eventhey .ace ready to serve the community at,63
NA,"times should cyclones, fires, floods, or",63
NA,he has disaster in any other form occur.,63
NA,I do not think the Government can,63
NA,properly measure the valuable service that,63
NA,Australia's radio hams have given fhe coun-,63
NA,try by promoting international goodwill.,63
NA,Their operations are not confined to Aus-,63
NA,tralia. Their transmissions go far abroad,63
NA,and carry messages of goodwill from Aus-,63
NA,"wherever, they are received. Aus-",63
NA,tralia's amateur broadcasters are doing a,63
NA,"splendid job for their country in spreading,",63
NA,"the spirit of understanding, friendship and",63
NA,among the fraternity of ham,63
NA,"operators throughout the world, and this",63
NA,must pay Australia great dividends in,63
NA,tribute the long run. We are indebted to our,63
NA,amateur broadcasters for their work in,63
NA,and war-time also. It is greatly to the credit,63
NA,the hams who were operating just prior,63
NA,"to World War II . that, on the outbreak of",63
NA,"in war, those in the military age-group who-",63
NA,to were fit joined up in a body and served,63
NA,the signals branches of the three ser-,63
NA,vices. Amateur operators are ready re-,63
NA,serve again if a war emergency arises. If,63
NA,- we could measure completely the value of,63
NA,the work done by Australia's ham radio-,63
NA,"broadcasters, I think we could say that the",63
NA,"experience gained by them in signals work,",63
NA,"radar, electronics, and the manufacture of",63
NA,"a radio equipment, is so important that",63
NA,without it Australia's defence programme,63
NA,would be six months behind the present,63
NA,stage. I think the valuable work these men,63
NA,are doing in pursuing their hobby deserves-,63
NA,due recognition from the Government.,63
NA,There are many ways in which it could give,63
NA,them perhaps greater recognition than tbey,63
NA,been for have received in the past.,63
NA,"Earlier, I mentioned that the Postmaster-",63
NA,General had given a sympathetic hearing to>,63
NA,the representations for the more extensive,63
NA,counfitting of suppressors to household,63
NA,and motor cars to prevent radio-,63
NA,but interference. I mentioned this matter in,63
NA,relation to television on a previous occasion.,63
NA,Interference can cause great distortion of,63
NA,"the image on a television screen. Also,,",63
NA,of if appliances such as electric razors and,63
NA,washing machines are not fitted with sup-,63
NA,"perpressors they might, because of the low",63
NA,power on which hams are forced to operate,63
NA,"do in Australia, cause interference with their",63
NA,signals. Even an electric razor being usedi,63
NA,"in one house can put the ham, who is",64
NA,"operating in an adjoining house, off the",64
NA,air until the fellow using the razor has,64
NA,finished shaving. I ask the Postmaster-,64
NA,General ( Mr Davidson) to endeavour to,64
NA,persuade the State governments to enforce,64
NA,the fitting of suppressors to all household-,64
NA,"electric appliances and motor cars, and",64
NA,also to inform the general public of the,64
NA,"interference that can be caused, not only",64
NA,"to television, but also to ham operators,",64
NA,by the use of faulty electrical equipment.,64
NA,Mr Wheeler -Wha t cost is involved,64
NA,in the fitting of suppressors?,64
NA,NA,64
NA,suppressor can be fitted to any electrical,64
NA,"appliance for about 2s., so that no great",64
NA,outlay of cash would be involved. There,64
NA,is one other matter that causes me some,64
NA,concern in regard to ham operators; that,64
NA,"is, the restriction placed on the power",64
NA,under which they may operate in Australia.,64
NA,"In New Zealand, hams are allowed to",64
NA,"operate up to a maximum wattage of 250,",64
NA,"whilst in America, the limit is 1,000 watts.",64
NA,"Bm here in Australia, we keep them down",64
NA,to 100 watts. As Australia is a large coun-,64
NA,"try, I think that consideration should be",64
NA,.given to increasing the maximum wattage,64
NA,at which hams can operate at least to the,64
NA,limit of 250 watts that is observed in New,64
NA,"Zealand. By the use of additional power,",64
NA,the hams could get their signals through,64
NA,more clearly than under the present limit,64
NA,of 100 watts.,64
NA,TheFe is one other way in which we,64
NA,"could help them, and it would not cost",64
NA,"anything, at all. We could allow them com-",64
NA,plete freedom in the importation of equip-,64
NA,ment that has been developed as a result,64
NA,"of experiments overseas,, particularly in the",64
NA,"United States of America, which seems to",64
NA,"lead, the world in the radio field. It would",64
NA,be very little for us to do for a band of,64
NA,devoted people who have served Australia,64
NA,"well, and who are ready to serve again, if",64
NA,"need be, should we experience either exter-",64
NA,"nal or internal trouble, to give them ready",64
NA,access to import licences to enable them to,64
NA,"bring into this country, duty free, any",64
NA,material that they need for experimental,64
NA,"purposes, and to exempt from sales tax any",64
NA,such material that is manufactured in,64
NA,Australia.,64
NA,"As I mentioned earlier, the radio opera-",64
NA,tors circulate throughout the world. They,64
NA,"plan to meet, probably in Geneva* in 1959.",64
NA,"That may sound a long way off, but it is",64
NA,"sot so far ahead in terms of planning, and",64
NA,when they meet they will discuss their,64
NA,problems and establish standards to operate,64
NA,"until the next conference is held, probably",64
NA,four or five years later. I think that it is,64
NA,essential for Australia to be well repre-,64
NA,sented at the proposed conference. How-,64
NA,"ever, at the moment, it appears that it will",64
NA,be left to the Wireless Institute of Aus-,64
NA,tralia to provide the necessary money to,64
NA,send its representatives to the conference.,64
NA,"As we subsidize rifle clubs, because of their",64
NA,"defence, value to the community,. I think",64
NA,that it would not be unreasonable for us,64
NA,"to say to the institute,. "" If you pick the",64
NA,"men you want to go to the conference, we",64
NA,"will pay their fares, or subsidize by 50 pei",64
NA,"cent, the cost involved "", so that Australia",64
NA,can be adequately represented. I am sure,64
NA,that suoh a gesture by the Government,64
NA,would pay valuable dividends in the long,64
NA,run. Before hastening to the next subject,64
NA,"to which I want to address myself, 1 should",64
NA,like to emphasize that we cannot pay too,64
NA,high a tribute to these men who are serving,64
NA,"Australia so well to-day, and who have",64
NA,done a grand job for us in times of emer-,64
NA,gency and peril. By helping them in tbe,64
NA,"way I have suggested we would, at least to a",64
NA,"small degree,, compensate them for their",64
NA,good work.,64
NA,The other matter that I want to bring,64
NA,before the committee concerns the bounty,64
NA,that is payable under the Sulphuric Acid,64
NA,Bounty Act. With all the goodwill in the,64
NA,"world, the Government placed that mea-",64
NA,sure on the statute-book as an incentive to,64
NA,Australian acid manufacturers to use indi-,64
NA,"genous material, such as iron pyrites, for the",64
NA,manufacture of sulphuric acid. I notice,64
NA,"that £512,471 was expended on such, boun-",64
NA,"ties during the last financial year, and this",64
NA,"year it is estimated that £450,000 will be so",64
NA,expended. It is a matter of regret to me,64
NA,"that, despite this incentive, the great sul-",64
NA,phuric acid manufacturers of Australia are,64
NA,"not fully using pyrites, and the producers of",64
NA,"pyrites, including Mount Morgan Mines",64
NA,Limited and the Lake George Mining Com-,64
NA,pany at Captains Flat have not benefited,64
NA,because the Government has been long-,64
NA,winded in adopting a practical solution to,64
NA,the problem. Officers of the Department,64
NA,of Defence Production have visited various,64
NA,parts of Australia to see whether an im-,65
NA,provement can be effected. I do not believe,65
NA,that Australia can afford to spend millions,65
NA,of pounds on the importation of sulphur for,65
NA,the manufacture of sulphuric acid when,65
NA,there are indigenous materials at hand that,65
NA,could be utilized by the sulphuric acid,65
NA,manufacturers without incurring undue cost.,65
NA,1 urge the Government to turn its mind,65
NA,expeditiously to this subject. I think that,65
NA,a limitation should be placed on the im-,65
NA,"portation of sulphur, and the money thus",65
NA,saved should be used to import other com-,65
NA,modities that we need. It would mean a,65
NA,great deal to the mining companies them-,65
NA,selves if the Government could say to them,65
NA,"quickly-an d I am told, he gives twice who",65
NA,"gives quickly- "" In order to save dollars,",65
NA,indigenous materials should be used for the,65
NA,"manufacture of sulphuric acid "". I point",65
NA,out that it is necessary for mining com-,65
NA,panies to plan a long way ahead. 'The life,65
NA,of the great mine that is operated by Mount,65
NA,Morgan Limited might be reduced by 50,65
NA,years if the abundant supply of pyrites that,65
NA,"is available is not used. On the other hand,",65
NA,the reverse would be the case if the pyrites,65
NA,were used; the mine would have another,65
NA,"50 years of profitable and effective life, to",65
NA,the benefit of the people of the district. I,65
NA,ask the Minister at the table ( Mr Davidson;,65
NA,to express my strong conviction in this,65
NA,matter to the Government. I hope that,65
NA,something will be done speedily to encour-,65
NA,"age the pyrites mining industry, because it",65
NA,is important to the welfare of the nation.,65
NA,NA,65
NA,to address myself to the subject of the repatsettled,65
NA,"riation of ex-servicemen, which is a respon-",65
NA,sibility of thc Commonwealth Government.,65
NA,Although the Commonwealth can share cer-,65
NA,"tain functions with the States, ultimately the",65
NA,obligation to repatriate ex-servicemen rests,65
NA,"on this Government. In 1953, I asked the",65
NA,"then Minister for the Interior, the honor-",65
NA,able member for Chisholm ( Mr Kent,65
NA,Hughes) to inform me of the number of,65
NA,ex-servicemen who had applied for land,65
NA,under the war service land settlement,65
NA,"scheme. He stated that 36,000 of those",65
NA,who had applied for land were regarded by,65
NA,the Government as qualified by age or,65
NA,"training, or both, to take up land. More",65
NA,than that number had applied for land but,65
NA,"only 36,000 had all the qualifications essen-",65
NA,tial to make a success of farming. The,65
NA,other day I asked the Minister for Primary,65
NA,Industry ( Mr MCMahon) to tell me the,65
NA,number of ex-servicemen who had been,65
NA,settled upon the land and the cost to the,65
NA,Government of their settlement. He,65
NA,informed me that throughout the Common-,65
NA,"wealth 7,529 had been settled and the cost",65
NA,to the Commonwealth Government was.,65
NA,"£56,645,491. In addition to that, New",65
NA,"South Wales had spent £38,600,000.",65
NA,"Victoria £38,000,000, and Queensland",65
NA,"£4,700,000. That means that 7,000 persons",65
NA,were settled upon the land at a cost of,65
NA,"£138,000,000.",65
NA,Mr Mackinnon -Tha t did not include,65
NA,single-unit farms.,65
NA,NA,65
NA,were settled upon the land. Re-establish-,65
NA,ment agricultural loan applications were in,65
NA,"addition to that, and. £10,000.000 was",65
NA,granted for that purpose.,65
NA,The point I desire to make is that that,65
NA,is a vast expenditure to settle comparatively,65
NA,"few people upon the land. The story, of",65
NA,"course, is worse than it appears at first",65
NA,"sight, because in Tasmania 340 ex-service-",65
NA,"men were settled at a cost of £9,338,000.",65
NA,"nearly £30,000 for each settler. In Western",65
NA,Australia 692 ex-servicemen were settled,65
NA,"at a cost of £24.241,000, again over £30,000",65
NA,"for each settler - Of course, some additional",65
NA,work may be in progress that will mean that,65
NA,ultimately more ex-servicemen will go upon,65
NA,"the land. However, the figures are stagger-",65
NA,ing and national disaster exists in the fact,65
NA,"that we cannot, as a nation, commence any",65
NA,type of civilian settlement until we have,65
NA,all the ex-servicemen seeking to go,65
NA,upon the land.,65
NA,It is of the greatest importance to the,65
NA,people of this country that more and more,65
NA,people be settled upon the land. I recall,65
NA,that during the period prior to World,65
NA,War II . governments in this country were,65
NA,deploring the drift from the country to the,65
NA,cities. They were deploring the lack ot,65
NA,balance that existed in the community due,65
NA,to a large preponderance of people being,65
NA,engaged in urban and city occupations,65
NA,whilst relatively few were settled on the,65
NA,land. As the years passed by those engaged,65
NA,"in rural occupations were becoming fewer,",65
NA,and it was said that the position had to be,65
NA,"remedied. To-day, we have a governmenl",65
NA,that points out that we must bring more,65
NA,and more immigrants from overseas if we,65
NA,are to carry on efficiently as a nation and,66
NA,develop Australia as it should be developed,66
NA,and that our immigrants must be employed,66
NA,mainly in primary production. That being,66
NA,"so, we should have more and more people",66
NA,upon the land. Even if the population of,66
NA,Australia had remained stationary from,66
NA,1939 until the present time the position,66
NA,"would not be satisfactory, but it has not",66
NA,"done so. In 1939, the population was",66
NA,"7,077,586, whereas to-day it is over",66
NA,"9,090,000. The census taken in 1954",66
NA,"revealed a population of 9,090,000 people.",66
NA,"So, there were 2,000,000 more people in",66
NA,this country at that date than there were,66
NA,in 1940.,66
NA,I also asked the Minister for Primary,66
NA,Industry to state the number of rural hold-,66
NA,ings in 1939 and the number to-day. The,66
NA,Minister was unable to tell me the number,66
NA,in 1939 but he told me that in 1946 the,66
NA,"number was 233,000. I am able to tell the",66
NA,Minister the figure for 1939 because I,66
NA,"secured the information from the "" Year-",66
NA,"Book'"". In 1939 there were 253,000 farms",66
NA,"in Australia whereas, to-day, there arc",66
NA,"20,000 fewer farms in this country.",66
NA,Mr Mackinnon -Tha t number included,66
NA,areas of under ten acres on which somebody,66
NA,ran a cow or a sheep. Those areas have,66
NA,been absorbed in building settlements,66
NA,adjacent to metropolitan areas.,66
NA,NA,66
NA,for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon) points,66
NA,out that the number I have quoted includes,66
NA,small farms. I am an advocate for small,66
NA,"farms. The fact is that in 1939, 253,000",66
NA,farms were owned by farmers and in 1946,66
NA,"the number was 233,000, a diminution of",66
NA,"20,000. At the present time, I am in-",66
NA,"formed, the number is 243,000; so, the",66
NA,number of farms has diminished by over,66
NA,"10,000 although £138,000,000 has been",66
NA,expended in order to settle on the land,66
NA,"7,000 more farmers, and, in addition,",66
NA,"£10,000,000 has been granted to farmers in",66
NA,occupation of farms or to others who were,66
NA,securing farms and required only re-estab-,66
NA,lishment agricultural loans. Nobody can,66
NA,be satisfied with that position from a,66
NA,national point of view.,66
NA,f also asked the Minister for Primary,66
NA,Industry to state the number of people en-,66
NA,gaged in rural occupations in 1939. He,66
NA,informed me that in that year the number,66
NA,"was 391.000, and in 1955 it was 357,000, a",66
NA,"reduction of 34,000, despite the fact that we",66
NA,have an increased population of well over,66
NA,"2,000,000 people. No one can deny thai",66
NA,there is a lack of balance in the develop-,66
NA,ment of this country about which tie,66
NA,Government should do something. Tie,66
NA,"Commonwealth Government, of course, fas",66
NA,the overriding authority. It provides tie,66
NA,finance and those who pay the piper shoud,66
NA,have a fair chance of at least calling tie,66
NA,tune.,66
NA,"I suggest to the Government that, in tie",66
NA,interests of the development of this nation,66
NA,and to encourage more and more people b,66
NA,"go on to the land, it should immediately cal",66
NA,a conference of representatives of the Stat;,66
NA,departments which deal with land settle,66
NA,ment and Commonwealth authorities. Thost,66
NA,representatives should investigate methods,66
NA,that will enable the completion of soldier,66
NA,settlement schemes and evolve some plan,66
NA,that will enable a greater settlement to take,66
NA,place throughout this country. Everybody,66
NA,knows that vast areas of land are not being,66
NA,used to their full productive capacity. From,66
NA,the east to the west of Victoria are vast,66
NA,areas of land with hardly a sheep or any,66
NA,other animal upon them. They are not,66
NA,being used to their full productive capacity.,66
NA,Any one travelling by train from Victoria,66
NA,to Canberra will see areas of land in New,66
NA,"South Wales that, under existing conditions,",66
NA,are not being used to their full productive,66
NA,capacity.,66
NA,With the advantages that science has,66
NA,"brought to agriculture, those areas could",66
NA,be made considerably more productive than,66
NA,they are to-day. The development of those,66
NA,areas would make possible the settlement,66
NA,of more people on the land and absorb some,66
NA,"of those who have come, or who may come,",66
NA,from overseas to help to build up this great,66
NA,nation. But nothing is done! Eleven years,66
NA,"have passed since World War II . ended,",66
NA,but governments admit that they have not,66
NA,completed the scheme for the land settle-,66
NA,ment of ex-servicemen that was commenced,66
NA,after the war. I do not know how many,66
NA,of those who fought in Korea have applied,66
NA,"for land, but their prospects are distant",66
NA,indeed.,66
NA,"In a country like Australia, the settle-",66
NA,ment of people on the land should be a,66
NA,major and urgent consideration. The Com-,66
NA,monwealth says that the States should,66
NA,"undertake this responsibility, and the State*",66
NA,sav that the Commonwealth does not pro-,67
NA,vide sufficient money for the purpose.,67
NA,Because that method of evading respon-,67
NA,"sibility is adopted, the scheme of repatria-",67
NA,tion is not carried out. When I asked my,67
NA,"question in 1953, I was told that 36,000",67
NA,"elijible, suitable people had applied to go",67
NA,on the land. If I were to ask the Minister,67
NA,today how many men wanted to go on the,67
NA,"laid, I would probably find that there is",67
NA,"net the difference between the 7,000 that",67
NA,hai been settled upon the land,67
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , ( Mr.,67
NA,Bwden) -Order ! The honorable mem-,67
NA,ber's time has expired.,67
Mr TURNBULL ,Mallee) [10.4] -,67
NA,lefore I come to the matters on which I,67
NA,"cesire to speak, I shall touch on one or two",67
NA,«f the salient points made by the honorable,67
NA,NA,67
NA,"rery rightly, that war service land settlement",67
NA,has cost an enormous amount of money. I,67
NA,"know that is to be deplored, but however",67
NA,"much soldier settlement costs, when valua-",67
NA,tions of soldier settlement holdings are,67
NA,"made, the men who have been put on the",67
NA,land must secure it at a productive value.,67
NA,It is not their fault that it has cost the Go-,67
NA,vernment a lot of money. Valuations are,67
NA,being made at the present time in a place,67
NA,"that I represent, Robinvale, in Victoria,",67
NA,where we have a great new vine fruit settle-,67
NA,ment. Many of the settlers realize that the,67
NA,prices that are indicated are far too high for,67
NA,them to be able to make a good living.,67
NA,Although these blocks have cost a lot of,67
NA,"money, as the honorable member for Scullin",67
NA,"has rightly pointed out, let us advocate in",67
NA,"this Parliament, whenever we get the oppor-",67
NA,"tunity, that the valuations for the returned",67
NA,soldiers be kept as low as possible. If that,67
NA,"is done, these men who have served this",67
NA,country will go on the land with a chance of,67
NA,making a good living and at the same time,67
NA,will be in a position to produce those goods,67
NA,that we now need so urgently-mor e,67
NA,"urgently, perhaps, than ever before.",67
NA,The other point I want to make may not,67
NA,be quite so pleasant to the honorable mem-,67
NA,ber for Scullin. He has pointed out that,67
NA,fewer people are on the land to-day than,67
NA,was the case some years ago. I have no,67
NA,"reason whatever to doubt his figures, but I",67
NA,believe there is an explanation for the posi-,67
NA,tion. Tbe explanation is that we have,67
NA,modern machinery now. We have,67
NA,machinery which enables two men to har-,67
NA,vest hundreds of bushels of wheat whereas,67
NA,previously many men were required to do,67
NA,"the job. Hitherto, bags had to be sewn,",67
NA,and other jobs had to be done by hand',67
NA,which gave employment to a number of,67
NA,"men. To-day, we have bulk handling of",67
NA,"wheat, and few employees are required.",67
NA,That is the full answer to the honorable-,67
NA,member for Scullin.,67
NA,When I came into this Parliament first in,67
NA,"1946, just after the war, when Labour",67
NA,"was in power, most of my correspondence",67
NA,"was from people wanting tractors, harves-",67
NA,ters and all the modern equipment. Witb,67
NA,"the new machinery, two or three times the",67
NA,amount of work can be done with half the,67
NA,number of men. That is all the better for,67
NA,"this great continent of Australia because,",67
NA,"as everybody knows, we have a labour'",67
NA,shortage. The more labour we can save by,67
NA,"using machinery, up to a point-an d I",67
NA,admit with Labour supporters that it must,67
NA,"be up to a point-th e better for this,",67
NA,country.,67
NA,The honorable member for Scullin also-,67
NA,stated that vast areas of land are not being,67
NA,used in this country.,67
NA,NA,67
NA,productive capacity.,67
Mr TURNBULL , I accept the correc-,67
NA,tion. I want to be right when I use the,67
NA,words of the honorable member for Scullin.,67
NA,His suggestion is quite right in relation to-,67
NA,some places. He said that any one travel-,67
NA,ling to Canberra through Albury can see,67
NA,vast areas of paddocks without much stock,67
NA,on them. Much the same thing can be,67
NA,"seen in my electorate, but there is such a",67
NA,thing as rotation of cropping. The best,67
NA,method is to sow a crop of wheat in one,67
NA,"year, miss two years and then sow another",67
NA,crop. If a crop is sown every year on the,67
NA,"same land, the returns will rapidly diminish.",67
NA,"With the high price of sheep to-day, it does",67
NA,not pay a man to buy sheep and put them,67
NA,"on the land, in certain circumstances, al-",67
NA,though it is an aid to the rotational system.,67
NA,That is the answer to the honorable member,67
NA,for Scullin. There are areas of land that,67
NA,"could be brought into greater productivity,",67
NA,but a lot of the paddocks that the city,67
NA,dweller looks at and thinks are not used,67
NA,"because he cannot see any stock or crops,",67
NA,"are not really neglected. There are reasons,",67
NA,"for these things, and this is the place for",67
NA,us to give those reasons when a speech is,68
NA,"made, such as that made by the honorable",68
NA,"member for Scullin, which is not wholly",68
NA,wrong but is only partly correct.,68
NA,I want to thank the Federal Government,68
NA,"for providing £300,000 for the dried vine",68
NA,"fruit growers of Victoria, not as a loan,",68
NA,as a grant. This Government gave it to,68
NA,them through the Victorian Government.,68
NA,For two years I have been pointing out in,68
NA,this chamber that the dried fruits industry,68
NA,needed all the assistance we could give it.,68
NA,"In the dry seasons some years ago, the",68
NA,industry had good drying periods; but over,68
NA,"the last four or five years, just when the",68
NA,"harvest was ready, down came the rain.",68
NA,That was all right for wheat but it was no,68
NA,"good for dried fruits. When the rain came,",68
NA,the crop was absolutely ruined. The grant,68
NA,"of £300,000, and the price paid overseas",68
NA,"for dried fruits, have given the industry new",68
NA,"life. Although this year's crop is very poor,",68
NA,I hope brighter times are ahead for the,68
NA,dried fruits industry.,68
NA,Before I say something that does not,68
NA,favour the Postmaster-General ( Mr.,68
NA,"Davidson), I want to state that I was very",68
NA,"delighted, after my advocacy, that he was",68
NA,able to reinstate a news service from,68
NA,stations 3WV and 3WL in western Victoria.,68
NA,It will be remembered that I. mentioned,68
NA,this matter in the House on a previous,68
NA,occasion. I said that on Monday morning,68
NA,"we had an all-sports broadcast, and that",68
NA,we had no news service at all from Saturday,68
NA,night until Monday night. That has now,68
NA,"been changed, and we have a six-minute",68
NA,western Victorian regional news service on,68
NA,"Monday mornings from 3WV and 3WL,",68
NA,followed by four minutes of South Aus-,68
NA,tralian news. It was thought at one time,68
NA,that there would not be enough news to fill,68
NA,"in the time, but that has not proved to be",68
NA,"the case. The time is well filled, and the",68
NA,news is quite interesting. When we tune,68
NA,in to this news broadcast we get all the,68
NA,"week-end news, and every one knows that",68
NA,it is. during the week-end that interesting,68
NA,news items are gathered. I can assure,68
NA,honorable members that my constituents and,68
NA,others fully appreciate it.,68
NA,1 should like now to make some remarks,68
NA,about flood relief. I: represent a district,68
NA,that includes 248 miles of Murray River,68
NA,"frontage, and the people in my electorate",68
NA,have suffered severely. I had the privilege,68
NA,"ef submitting to the House, as its first",68
NA,"business in this sessional period, a definite",68
NA,"matter of urgent public importance, namely,",68
NA,the disastrous effect of the flooding of the,68
NA,Murray River and its tributaries. In the,68
NA,short time at my disposal I could not,68
NA,"traverse the matter in full detail, nor can I",68
NA,but do so now. I have been in the affected,68
NA,area again recently. I went to Swan Hill,68
NA,"last Saturday, and one of the results of the",68
NA,flood devastation that was particularly,68
NA,noticeable was the state of the roads. They,68
NA,are just deplorable. The floods have,68
NA,undermined the bitumen and the founda-,68
NA,"tions, and have swept the road material",68
NA,away in many places. Much of the road,68
NA,"foundations have been completely destroyed,",68
NA,and it will cost many thousands of pounds,68
NA,to put the roads back into their former con-,68
NA,dition. I have tried previously to persuade,68
NA,the Government to change the formula that,68
NA,is used for the distribution of receipts from,68
NA,petrol tax. If the whole of the money raised,68
NA,by petrol tax were distributed to the States.,68
NA,Western Australia and Queensland would,68
NA,receive far more than they could use.,68
NA,Every one knows that that is a fact. I,68
NA,"suggest that the Govemment, which is retain-",68
NA,ing about 5d. of the tax collected on each,68
NA,"gallon of petrol, should distribute some of",68
NA,"that money, in the form of flood relief, to",68
NA,enable the roads that have been devastated,68
NA,by floods to be repaired. This is a fair,68
NA,"proposition, because the tax has been col-",68
NA,lected from people who transport goods,68
NA,"over the roads, and transport vehicles must",68
NA,be enabled to travel again over good roads,68
NA,in these districts if we are to market the,68
NA,"products that grow there so proliflcally, and",68
NA,"if, as the honorable member for Scullin",68
NA,NA,68
NA,more people to settle on the land in the,68
NA,future.,68
NA,The Postmaster-General ( Mr Davidson),68
NA,knows very well that when I said that 1,68
NA,might speak of a matter that is less pleasing,68
NA,to him I referred to the post office at Robin-,68
NA,"vale, in Victoria. Robinvale is a very pro-",68
NA,"gressive soldier settlement area, where the",68
NA,"settlers produce, mainly, dried vine fruits.",68
NA,The post office in this town is an old tin,68
NA,shed. It was illustrated in the Melbourne,68
NA,""" Argus"" some nine or ten months ago.",68
NA,The population of the town some little time,68
NA,"ago was only 200 or 300, but now it has",68
NA,"grown to about 3,000, and we still have the",68
NA,old tin shed for a post office. I am not,68
NA,"complaining too bitterly about this matter,",68
NA,because for some years I have been advo-,69
NA,cating that a new post office should be,69
NA,"built at Robinvale, and the Postmaster-",69
NA,General has assured me that provision has,69
NA,been made for it in the Estimates. But it,69
NA,was also provided for in the Estimates last,69
NA,year. I am not sure whether it was in the,69
NA,Estimates for the year before that. How-,69
NA,"ever, it is included in the Estimates for this",69
NA,"year, and I hope that a start will be made",69
NA,-on it. Honorable members can imagine,69
NA,the conditions in a tin shed in northern,69
NA,"Victoria in summer, not only for the em-",69
NA,ployees of the department but also for the,69
NA,vastly increased population of the town and,69
NA,"-district, who have to use this public utility.",69
NA,1 ask the Postmaster-General to endeavour,69
NA,"to expedite this work as much as possible,",69
NA,-so that the people of Robinvale may be pro-,69
NA,vided with a post office building worthy of,69
NA,rhe town.,69
NA,We have heard many honorable members,69
NA,speaking about railways and some speaking,69
NA,"about the port at Portland, and I wish to",69
NA,say a few words on this subject in the short,69
NA,time that remains at my disposal. We have,69
NA,"had general discussions on railways, and I",69
NA,"believe, therefore, that I am entitled to",69
NA,-speak on this matter. I have advocated on,69
NA,many occasions the construction of a rail-,69
NA,way from Hay to Ouyen. This is not only,69
NA,my idea; it has been advocated by people,69
NA,in northern Victoria and other places for,69
NA,25 years or more. A railway line from,69
NA,Hay to Ouyen would provide a rail link,69
NA,"from Adelaide to Sydney, obviating the",69
NA,necessity to send goods via Melbourne.,69
NA,"This, incidentally, may be a reason why we",69
NA,have not been successful in obtaining this,69
NA,"rail link, because the city octopus prefers",69
NA,"to have the goods sent through Melbourne,",69
NA,and then through Bacchus Marsh and up a,69
NA,"-steep grade, where all the loads have to be",69
NA,reduced. If a line were constructed be-,69
NA,tween Hay and Ouyen. and another from,69
NA,"Patchewollock to Ouyen, we would have a",69
NA,link with the port at Portland. The honor-,69
NA,able member for Ballarat ( Mr Erwin) has,69
NA,said that it is time we had a port at Port-,69
NA,"land, and also one at Eden. J can tell him",69
NA,that the one at Portland is almost an,69
NA,accomplished fact. The work has been,69
NA,"going on for some years, and before many",69
NA,more years have passed there will be a,69
NA,first-class deep-water port at Portland. I,69
NA,"am most interested in this matter, because I",69
NA,believe that we should send goods from the,69
NA,"Mallee district to Portland, and receive",69
NA,goods at that place from overseas and from,69
NA,other parts of Australia. They should then,69
NA,be transported into the north-western part,69
NA,of Victoria without going through Mel-,69
NA,bourne at all.,69
NA,An amount of money has been provided,69
NA,in these Estimates for the reception of,69
NA,immigrants. I believe that a lot of immi-,69
NA,grants who have been nominated for rural,69
NA,work never get to the country at all. They,69
NA,come to Melbourne and are then sent to,69
NA,"the reception depots, and are offered good",69
NA,wages for jobs in the city. Their friends,69
NA,"persuade them to stay in Melbourne, and",69
NA,their nominators may never see them. Those,69
NA,immigrants should disembark at places like,69
NA,"Portland, from which they can be sent",69
NA,straight to their destinations in the country.,69
NA,They should not be exposed to the cit>,69
NA,lights immediately on their arrival in the,69
NA,country. Many of these immigrants have,69
NA,"worked on intensive culture farms, which",69
NA,"are little better than market gardens, and",69
NA,which are usually located adjacent to cities.,69
NA,They have been able to go to the cities every,69
NA,"weekend, and in some cases every night. If",69
NA,we take them hundreds of miles from a city,69
NA,they will want to get back to it. In ordet,69
NA,"to start them off on the right track, I suggest",69
NA,that reception depots should be located ai,69
NA,places like Portland. The immigrants can,69
NA,"then be sent to their jobs in the country,",69
NA,and they will be more likely to stay there.,69
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,69
NA,Order! The honorable member's time has.,69
NA,expired.,69
Mr MINOGUE ,West Sydney) [10.19].,69
NA,-Th e group of Estimates that we are now,69
NA,"discussing includes miscellaneous services,",69
NA,refunds of revenue and advance to the,69
NA,Treasurer. My complaint is that the Trea-,69
NA,surer has given very few advances to the,69
NA,"State of New South Wales, in which my",69
NA,electorate is situated. We are also con-,69
NA,"sidering bounties and subsidies, and wai",69
NA,and repatriation services.,69
NA,For the last eight weeks we have been,69
NA,discussing the budget and the Estimates for,69
NA,various departments. Most of our time,69
NA,has been taken up with a discussion of the,69
NA,Estimates for defence services. I take,69
NA,second place to no one in advocating the,69
NA,"effective defence of Australia, but I believe",69
NA,"it is wrong to spend £190,000,000 annually",69
NA,"on defence in peace-time, while allowing",69
NA,thousands of our people to go hungry and,69
NA,unhoused. When war breaks out no diffi-,70
NA,culty is encountered in finding money to,70
NA,finance our war effort. I f the last world,70
NA,"war had continued for another two years,",70
NA,we would have found sufficient money to,70
NA,conduct it.,70
NA,The people whom 1 represent should be,70
NA,much better looked after. Every honorable,70
NA,member will agree with the Government,70
NA,"that shipping is very important, but I have",70
NA,before me a letter from a worker at Cocka-,70
NA,too Dock showing just what the Govern-,70
NA,ment is doing about providing shipping.,70
NA,Potatoes have been lying on the wharfs in,70
NA,"Tasmania, and hardly a ship has been avail-",70
NA,"able to bring them to Sydney, Melbourne",70
NA,and the other places where they are needed.,70
NA,"At the same time, shipbuilders, including",70
NA,many men who were trained under the,70
NA,Chifley Labour Government's reconstruc-,70
NA,"tion training scheme after the war, are being",70
NA,put off at Australian dockyards at the rate,70
NA,"of 100 a week. They are good tradesmen,",70
NA,but they are being told to look elsewhere,70
NA,for work. The letter gives first-hand infor-,70
NA,mation on what is happening in the dock-,70
NA,yards. It reads-,70
NA,"In the week ending 2nd October, about eighty",70
NA,"workers were dismissed at Cockatoo Dockyard, and",70
NA,the management has intimated that upwards of one,70
NA,hundred more will probably be dismissed in the,70
NA,next few weeks.,70
NA,"These sackings, following numerous others at",70
NA,Garden Island,70
NA,About 120 men were put off three weeks,70
NA,ago and a deputation came to Canberra to,70
NA,see the Minister for the Navy (Senator,70
NA,"O'Sullivan), but with very little result. The",70
NA,letter continues-,70
NA,"Williamstown Dockyard, N.S.W. State Dockyard,",70
NA,"Mort's Dock, Poole & Steel, and other firms, show",70
NA,an alarming situation in the Australian ship-,70
NA,building industry.,70
NA,Hundreds of men are being sacked while ships,70
NA,for our coastal trade are being built in West,70
NA,Germany and Japan.,70
NA,The Government is sacking men who fought,70
NA,"for their country, but is giving contracts for",70
NA,shipbuilding to West Germany and Japan!,70
NA,That is typical of its attitude -The writer,70
NA,continues-,70
NA,The Federal Government has stated and reitei-,70
NA,ated its intention of building and maintaining an,70
NA,efficient shipbuilding industry as a national,70
NA,"sity, but it would seem this is not being carried",70
NA,out.,70
NA,As an employee of Cockatoo and one of your,70
NA,"constituents, I request that you raise this matter",70
NA,in Parliament and have the dismissals at Cockatoo,70
NA,"cancelled, and also that steps be taken imme-",70
NA,diately to ensure that the declared policy of the,70
NA,Government is put into effect.,70
NA,Is it Government policy to throw skilled,70
NA,tradesmen into an unemployment pool? The,70
NA,honorable member for Mallee ( Mr.,70
NA,Turnbull) told us that men were not needed,70
NA,"in the country, where machinery did all the",70
NA,"work, yet in the dockyards and shipbuilding",70
NA,"industry of the cities men are being put off,",70
NA,as they were in the depression some,70
NA,years ago!,70
NA,I turn now to the subject of war and,70
NA,repatriation services. This is the most in-,70
NA,sincere Government that has ever sat on the,70
NA,treasury bench. I t has promised the soldiers,70
NA,"that it will give them homes, but it will have",70
NA,"gone to the polls, and been beaten, long",70
NA,before that promise can be honoured. Two,70
NA,years pass before an applicant for a war,70
NA,service home is authorized even to raise,70
NA,money with which to buy a home. The,70
NA,present Minister for Primary Industry ( Mr.,70
NA,"MCMahon), when he was Minister for Social",70
NA,-Services told honorable members that,70
NA,returned soldiers who wished to buy a home,70
NA,should be advised to go to a private bank or,70
NA,insurance company for finance.,70
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,70
NA,Order! Housing does not come within the,70
NA,scope of the Estimates that are before the,70
NA,committee.,70
Mr MINOGUE ,"Thi s Government, in",70
NA,-telling ex-servicemen that they will have a,70
NA,house in eighteen months' or two years',70
NA,"time, is making a promise that it does not",70
NA,"intend to fulfil. Indeed, it will not even be",70
NA,on the treasury bench in another two years.,70
NA,"As has happened on previous occasions, it",70
NA,will be dismissed from office and will leave,70
NA,the mess for the incoming Labour govern-,70
NA,ment to clean up.,70
NA,The Government has allowed the age,70
NA,"pensioners to starve, ignoring the fact that",70
NA,in recent years the cost of living has gone,70
NA,up 200 per cent. In New South Wales,70
NA,"alone, 60,000 people are still urgently in",70
NA,need of homes. A l l that this Government,70
NA,will do is to say that the State government,70
NA,must provide them. The present Minister,70
NA,neces- for the Army ( Mr Cramer) and the honor-,70
NA,able member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson) were,70
NA,"going to remedy the housing position, but",70
NA,precisely nothing has been done about iL,70
NA,Fifteen shillings of every £1 that is col-,70
NA,lected in taxation in New South Wales goes,70
NA,"to the federal Treasurer, who then tells",70
NA,us fhat the State should be able to build the,71
NA,"homes that it needs. About £14,000,000",71
NA,was spent on housing last year.,71
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,71
NA,Order! The honorable member cannot disMany,71
NA,cuss housing during a consideration of,71
NA,Estimates.,71
Mr MINOGUE ,Referrin g again to the,71
NA,"shipping position, I would mention the",71
NA,"plight of Lord Howe Island, which .has been",71
NA,virtually boycotted by tbis Government.,71
NA,Though the Treasurer collects income,71
NA,other taxes from the people of the island,71
NA,not one ship has been sent .there in recent,71
NA,times. Tbe Goverament ignores requests to,71
NA,visit the island and ascertain whether,71
NA,airstrip could be built there. There are,71
NA,"215 people oh the electoral roll, and",71
NA,visit the island on holidays every week.,71
NA,These 500 people are at the mercy of a,71
NA,service using a flying boat which is,71
NA,25 years old. If it breaks down tbere is,71
NA,- not .another to take its place. The Governtutions,71
NA,ment has ignored requests for the,71
NA,"-of shipping, and for the building of an air-",71
NA,strip at the island. The people of Lord,71
NA,"Howe Island, like Robinson Crusoe, are",71
NA,"marooned, yet this Government claims that",71
NA,it looks after the people.,71
NA,The Government has done a great dispaupers.,71
NA,"service to Australia, and ,to New South",71
NA,"""Wales in particular. The present Postmasterpersons",71
NA,"General ( Mr Davidson), when appointed, manner.",71
NA,gave excellent promise of supplying some of,71
NA,the services which have been unavailable,71
NA,"ten or twelve years, and wc felt that we",71
NA,well rid of his predecessor. The other day,71
NA,I brought up the case of a man who had,71
NA,been waiting for a telephone service,71
NA,ten years. He came into my office last,71
NA,Monday. He was on his way to the general,71
NA,"post office, to find out whether he would",71
NA,a telephone. The Minister had sent me a,71
NA,letter saying that he would get a telephone,71
NA,"within three months, but my constituent",71
NA,"said, "" I can't believe that. I don't think",71
NA,"that I will ever get i t "" . His application",71
NA,has been on the files ever since the honorto,71
NA,"able member for Dalley, Mr O'Connor,",71
NA,represented that portion of the present,71
NA,torate of West Sydney. It can be seen on,71
NA,the files.,71
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,71
NA,-Order! The honorable member must not,71
NA,mention names in this debate.,71
Mr MINOGUE ,Th e honorable mem-,71
NA,ber for East Sydney ( Mr Ward) has re-,71
NA,ferred in this chamber to persons who have,71
NA,had applications for telephones with the,71
NA,Postal Department for six or seven years.,71
NA,persons who urgently need telephone,71
NA,these connexions cannot get the service.,71
NA,1 give this Government credit for taking,71
NA,a step in the right direction when it pro-,71
NA,vided a £l-for-£l subsidy for the provision,71
NA,"of homes for aged persons, but the money",71
NA,that is available is not being spent quickly,71
NA,and enough. Why cannot the Government pro-,71
NA,vide this money without strings to it? Per-,71
NA,sons who are interested in institutions for,71
NA,the aged have to go around with collection,71
NA,an boxes trying to raise money so that they,71
NA,can obtain the benefit of a subsidy from,71
NA,".300 the Government. At this time, when",71
NA,hospital facilities for aged persons are not,71
NA,"available, and many are living in rooms or",71
NA,"about are sleeping in parks, the Government",71
NA,should make straight-out advances to insti-,71
NA,and organizations that are prepared,71
NA,provision to provide homes for the aged.,71
NA,The Government provides a funeral bene-,71
NA,fit of £10. It is impossible to buy a plot,71
NA,"of land for a grave for that amount, but",71
NA,the Government is prepared to allow the,71
NA,pioneers of Australia to be buried as,71
NA,I f they had not subscribed to,71
NA,"funds for funeral expenses, many aged",71
NA,-would not be buried in the proper,71
NA,We have an organization at No. 7,71
NA,"for Young-street, Sydney, where 3,000 meals",71
NA,were are provided for aged pensioners in the,71
NA,last days of each fortnight before pension,71
NA,day. They flock to that centre. There are,71
NA,for 30 beds where they may sleep without,71
NA,charge. This Government is always ready,71
NA,to give relief to other nations. Why can-,71
NA,get not it give aid to its own peqple first?,71
Mr DAVIDSON ,Dawson-Postmaster -,71
NA,General) [10.34] - I do not desire to in-,71
NA,"trude unduly into these discussions, or to",71
NA,take too much of the time that is available,71
NA,honorable members to discuss various,71
NA,departments in connexion witb the,71
NA,elecEstimates that are before the committee.,71
NA,"Nevertheless, it is desirable that I should",71
NA,make some comments on the opinions that,71
NA,have been expressed by honorable members,71
NA,in connexion with the work of the Post-,71
NA,master-General's Department. The honor-,71
NA,able member for Moore ( Mr Leslie),71
NA,referred to the operations of the Australian,72
NA,"Broadcasting Commission, and complained",72
NA,that no provision had been made for the,72
NA,Australian Broadcasting Commission team,72
NA,to conduct an Argonauts session at the,72
NA,Perth show. The honorable member said,72
NA,"he was aware that I , as Minister, had no",72
NA,control over the Australian Broadcasting,72
NA,"Commission programmes. That is correct,",72
NA,but I can assure him that a representative,72
NA,of the Australian Broadcasting Commission,72
NA,"is in the chamber, and I know that the",72
NA,remarks made by the honorable member,72
NA,for Moore will be noted by him.,72
NA,The honorable member for Banks ( Mr.,72
NA,Costa) spent all the time available to him in,72
NA,dealing with the possible introduction of the,72
NA,system called Tress. He credited me with,72
NA,having said that the system would improve,72
NA,telegraph services in Australia. I join issue,72
NA,"witb him on some of his statements, and",72
NA,that statement which he attributed to me,72
NA,is not correct. I believe I said that the,72
NA,system was being investigated because it,72
NA,appeared that it might improve the service,72
NA,that is available in Australia.,72
NA,It will be seen from figures that I shall,72
NA,cite that some improvement in the handling,72
NA,of telegraphic traffic is highly desirable.,72
NA,"The latest figures available, which relate to",72
NA,"the financial year ended 30th June, 1955,",72
NA,indicate that the operating costs in the,72
NA,handling of telegraphic traffic represent,72
NA,3s. lOd. of the total expenditure of 5s. 2d.,72
NA,"on each telegram. In that period, the",72
NA,average revenue from telegrams was about,72
NA,3s. 6d. so there is a large labour component,72
NA,"in operation costs. Therefore, some method",72
NA,of reducing the handling costs is highly,72
NA,desirable if we are to put those services on,72
NA,a sound economic basis.,72
NA,"The system known as Tress, which the",72
NA,honorable member described as the tele-,72
NA,phone reperforator electric switching sys-,72
NA,"tem, was designed in the United States of",72
NA,America with the object of improving the,72
NA,handling of telegraphic traffic. I believe,72
NA,"that it could be fairly described, without",72
NA,"going into technicalities, as a method of",72
NA,repeating telegrams over long distances,72
NA,through several repeating stations by auto-,72
NA,matic mechanical means instead of by,72
NA,"manual handling. In that respect, it is",72
NA,akin to a system that was introduced in,72
NA,Australia by the Postmaster-General's De-,72
NA,partment for the handling of long-range,72
NA,R--[55 ],72
NA,trunk-line telephone calls. That is the,72
NA,"transit system, by which it is now possible",72
NA,to connect a call from Perth to a person,72
NA,in Brisbane without any manual handling,72
NA,in the stations in between.,72
NA,"The Tress system was developed, as the",72
NA,"honorable member has said, in 1927, by the",72
NA,Western Union Company in the United,72
NA,"States. It is correct that, so far, that is one",72
NA,of the few countries that are operating it.,72
NA,That does not mean that the service is not,72
NA,satisfactory. The Postmaster-General's De-,72
NA,partment has had the system under investi-,72
NA,"gation for some time, because of the need",72
NA,for some method of reducing operational,72
NA,costs. The investigation was begun during,72
NA,"the regime of my predecessor, the honorable",72
NA,member for Richmond ( Mr Anthony). Ex-,72
NA,periments have been conducted in Mel-,72
NA,"bourne with a pilot plant, and inquiries",72
NA,have been made into the possible cost of,72
NA,installation. That is the position that has,72
NA,been reached so far in the investigations,72
NA,"and, as yet, as I have said in this chamber",72
NA,"previously, no firm determination to install",72
NA,the system has been reached. Two depart-,72
NA,mental officers were sent to the United,72
NA,States to investigate the system. They found,72
NA,"that it was operating very well, and gave",72
NA,great promise of being worthy of introduc-,72
NA,tion into Australia.,72
NA,A lot of propaganda about the system,72
NA,has emanated from the secretary of the,72
NA,Third Division Postal Clerks and Tele-,72
NA,graphists Union. He has written to most,72
NA,"honorable members, I believe, but many of",72
NA,the statements that he has made are not,72
NA,in accordance with the facts as I have,72
NA,ascertained them for myself. The honorable,72
NA,member said that it was estimated that the,72
NA,introduction of this system would reduce the,72
NA,telegraphic staff by about 400. I under-,72
NA,stand that is correct; but that does not mean,72
NA,that there would be wholesale retrenchment,72
NA,in the department because if the system is to,72
NA,be introduced- I repeat that this has not yet,72
NA,"been determined-i t will be done gradually,",72
NA,over a period of years. Telegraphists who,72
NA,are now working and who may be displaced,72
NA,at the start will not be retrenched because,72
NA,there will be only a few involved and they,72
NA,will be absorbed in other sections of the,72
NA,department. The department has no in-,72
NA,tention whatsoever of allowing highly trained,72
NA,men who have served it for years to be put,72
NA,out on the streets. Any further reductions,72
NA,in staffing which will be possible as the,73
NA,tem is developed can be taken care of by re-,73
NA,ducing the annual intake into the depart-,73
NA,"ment. Thus, retrenchment of those already",73
NA,employed will be obviated. When the investi-,73
NA,gations to which 1 have referred are com-,73
NA,"pleted, I assure the committee that the introthat",73
NA,duction or non-introduction of the Tress,73
NA,system will be treated as a matter of policy,73
NA,which will be determined not by the depart-,73
NA,ment but by the Government.,73
NA,"Before leaving this subject, let me correct",73
NA,a few of the mis-statements that have been,73
NA,made about the Tress system by those who,73
NA,are attempting to decry it. It has been,73
NA,"stated that a certain gentleman, who is a",73
NA,telegraph supervisor in Brisbane and who,73
NA,"has been to the United States of America,",73
NA,said on his return that he was prepared to,73
NA,report that it should not be installed. This,73
NA,gentleman has had discussions with some,73
NA,"of the senior officers of the department, and",73
NA,he has stated that in his opinion-h e has,73
NA,made a written statement to this effect-th e,73
NA,Tress system being operated in the United,73
NA,States by the Western Union Telegraph,73
NA,"Company appeared to be 100 per cent, satis-",73
NA,factory on the circuits operated by that,73
NA,company. He said he had discussions with,73
NA,officers of that company who had been with,73
NA,it for over 25 years and that they gave him,73
NA,io understand that the present system was,73
NA,more efficient than the old one. He claimed,73
NA,that the system he saw in operation was,73
NA,"efficient, virtually foolproof and labour-",73
NA,saving. I remind the committee that this is,73
NA,the gentleman who is supposed to have come,73
NA,back from America and decried the system.,73
NA,Addressing delegates at the annual con-,73
NA,ference of the Australian Fourth Division,73
NA,Telegraphists Union and the Postal Workers,73
NA,"Union, this same gentleman said he was",73
NA,amazed at the efficiency of Tress and was,73
NA,completely confident that competent engi-,73
NA,neers would be able to make the system,73
NA,work satisfactorily here.,73
NA,"At this stage, it is appropriate to quote",73
NA,"statements made by various men, most of",73
NA,"them union officials in the United States,",73
NA,who have had experience of this system.,73
NA,These statements are all more or less,73
NA,"commendatory. For instance, the vice-",73
NA,president of the Philadelphia local area,73
NA,stated that the telegraph service was more,73
NA,efficient than ever before. He said that the,73
NA,reduction of the human error factor in this,73
NA,sysmethod had been instrumental in providing,73
NA,greater accuracy in the transmission of,73
NA,"public telegram traffic. Mr J. Racz, district",73
NA,chairman of the local 146 C.T.U. in,73
NA,"America, said that the Australian Tele-",73
NA,"graphists Union had been misinformed, and",73
NA,the service had definitely been improved,73
NA,following the introduction of the reper-,73
NA,forator system. Those statements have,73
NA,been made not by departmental officers but,73
NA,by union representatives in America who,73
NA,have had experience of the system.,73
NA,It has been stated also that one of the,73
NA,reasons why this system is obviously not,73
NA,satisfactory is that it is in use only in the,73
NA,United States and that it is not used by,73
NA,postal authorities anywhere else in the world.,73
NA,The fact is that in Argentina there is an,73
NA,efficient teleprinter reperforator switching,73
NA,system in use on the public telegraph ser-,73
NA,"vice, and the postal administrations in",73
NA,South Africa and Western Germany are,73
NA,doing exactly what Australia is doing-the y,73
NA,are making investigations into the system,73
NA,with a view to adopting it if it proves to be,73
NA,"satisfactory. In addition, the Indian",73
NA,administration is considering the matter and,73
NA,so also are the telegraph operating com-,73
NA,panies of Canada which are private com-,73
NA,panies. This is a relatively recently,73
NA,"developed system, and that is the reason",73
NA,why it has not yet been adopted in other,73
NA,"countries outside America. However, it is",73
NA,under urgent investigation by other coun-,73
NA,"tries, and the fact that it is not yet adopted",73
NA,by them does not mean that it is not satis-,73
NA,factory.,73
NA,That is the position as I know it in con-,73
NA,nexion with this system. I have set out to,73
NA,give a factual statement in reply to what,73
NA,the honorable member for Banks has said.,73
NA,I repeat that as yet no determination has,73
NA,"been given, but I anticipate that within the",73
NA,next few weeks a report will be made to me,73
NA,from the department. Whatever happens,73
NA,after that will depend upon my interpreta-,73
NA,tion of that report and the attitude of the,73
NA,Government towards it as a policy matter.,73
NA,The honorable member for Kalgoorlie,73
NA,( Mr H. V. Johnson) referred to the pro-,73
NA,posed new post office at Geraldton for which,73
NA,he has been pressing me and my pre-,73
NA,decessor so strongly over a period of years.,73
NA,The department has stated quite frankly that,73
NA,it knows that there is need for a new post,73
NA,"office at Geraldton. In fact, a quite com-",73
NA,prehensive scheme was developed a couple,73
NA,of years ago. The honorable member for,74
NA,Kalgoorlie gave the full history of the case,74
NA,and he was quite correct when he said that,74
NA,in the list of new buildings for this year no,74
NA,provision is made for the commencement of,74
NA,the work at Geraldton. 1 very much regret,74
NA,"that fact, but the suggestion by the honor-",74
NA,able member that it would seem to him from,74
NA,a perusal of the list of buildings that are,74
NA,"to be commenced in Western Australia,",74
NA,that preference has been given to the con-,74
NA,struction of buildings in electorates repre-,74
NA,sented by Government members is com-,74
NA,pletely ill-founded. I do not think he,74
NA,really meant that very seriously. I have,74
NA,before me a list of the new works building,74
NA,programmes for all areas throughout Aus-,74
NA,tralia. It sets out the new buildings for,74
NA,"the various States, and gives their order",74
NA,of priority. The fact is that because the,74
NA,department has not got all the money for,74
NA,new capital works that it would like to,74
NA,have this year-althoug h in the circum-,74
NA,stances generally it has been given a very,74
NA,generous allocation-som e of the works on',74
NA,the Western Australian programme have had,74
NA,"to be cut out, and at the moment the",74
NA,Geraldton proposal is not being undertaken.,74
NA,Far from that building being omitted from,74
NA,the list in order to make provision for,74
NA,others in electorates represented by honor-,74
NA,"able members on this side, the fact is that",74
NA,it was taken out of the proposed programme,74
NA,in order to make provision for proceeding,74
NA,with the work of improving the facilities,74
NA,in the main store at Perth.,74
NA,"Some little time ago, before I went to",74
NA,"Perth, the federal secretary of the Aus-",74
NA,tralian Postal Workers Union saw me per-,74
NA,sonally and wrote to me about the state of,74
NA,the main store in Perth and referred par-,74
NA,ticular to the conditions under which the,74
NA,men were working. He said that those con-,74
NA,ditions were very bad and that it appeared,74
NA,as though it might be two or three years,74
NA,before any improvement was made. He,74
NA,said that something should be done urgently,74
NA,because of the very bad working conditions,74
NA,"in that store, and he asked me particularly",74
NA,to have a look at the store. I had a look,74
NA,"at it, and I agree with his statement that",74
NA,the conditions are bad. In summer the,74
NA,"building is extremely hot, and during the",74
NA,wet season there is a great deal of stagnant,74
NA,"water underneath it. Finally, in my own",74
NA,"opinion, there was a very grave fire",74
NA,in this building which housed tens of,74
NA,thojsands of poands worth of departmental,74
NA,"equipment. For those reasons, and after",74
NA,"discussions with departmental officers, it",74
NA,has bien decided this year to proceed with,74
NA,the third and fourth stages of that main,74
NA,store. This will vastly improve conditions,74
NA,for the postal workers and also make it a,74
NA,much better building for the storage of,74
NA,departmental equipment. I acknowledge,74
NA,that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie,74
NA,has made a case for a new post office at,74
NA,"G;raIJton, and as that building happens to",74
NA,b; the next item on the list to be dealt,74
NA,"with immediately we get more finance, 1",74
NA,shall not forget his representations.,74
NA,The honorable member for Kalgoorlie,74
NA,mentioned another matter which has also,74
NA,been referred to recently by other honor-,74
NA,"able members from Western Australia, par-",74
NA,ticularly the honorable member for Can-,74
NA,ning ( Mr Hamilton). It relates to broad-,74
NA,casting reception in Western Australia.,74
NA,The Australian Broadcasting Control Board,74
NA,realizes that reception is not good in certain,74
NA,areas of Western Australia. It has been,74
NA,"planning, for some time, to try to effect",74
NA,improvements in that State. This is not an,74
NA,"easy task, because of the large sparsely",74
NA,"populated areas. In actual fact, the national",74
NA,stations in the eastern States are required,74
NA,to cover a much greater number of people,74
NA,than the stations in Western Australia.,74
NA,There are two ways in which the board,74
NA,hopes to improve reception in Western Aus-,74
NA,tralia. One is by increasing the power of,74
NA,"the two stations at Perth which, I think,",74
NA,"speaking from memory, are 6WF and 6WN;",74
NA,and also by increasing the power of station,74
NA,6WA at Wagin. The power of this latter,74
NA,"station is to be increased to 50,000 watts,",74
NA,and I understand that the work required for,74
NA,that purpose will proceed at some time in,74
NA,"this financial year. I had the opportunity,",74
NA,"with my friend, the honorable member for",74
NA,"Canning ( Mr Hamilton), to see that station",74
NA,"during my visit to the west. I believe,",74
NA,"from representations made to me, that that",74
NA,increase in power will go a long way,74
NA,towards meeting the difficulties at present,74
NA,experienced in that area and towards,74
NA,Kalgoorlie.,74
NA,The north-western part of Western Aus-,74
NA,risk tralia presents a much more difficult,74
NA,"problem, because it is not economically or",75
NA,technically feasible to service that area by,75
NA,the installation of medium frequency,75
NA,stations. It has to be serviced by short-,75
NA,"wave stations, and we find that those",75
NA,stations are subject to a considerable,75
NA,amount of interference by stations operat-,75
NA,"ing in the Near East. For instance, there",75
NA,are times at which considerable interference,75
NA,"is experienced from foreign stations, due to",75
NA,the confused situation regarding the use of,75
NA,channels in the high frequency band and,75
NA,"to the fact that certain nations, including",75
NA,"the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, fre-",75
NA,quently transmit on channels assigned to,75
NA,other countries. Although representations,75
NA,are made to these countries from time to,75
NA,"time, and although some adjustments have",75
NA,"been made, the position is still not satisfac-",75
NA,tory from that stand-point.,75
NA,"Furthermore, the short-wave transmitters",75
NA,"in Perth, which operate on two kilowatts",75
NA,"and 10 kilowatts, respectively, are required",75
NA,to broadcast to areas in which some of the,75
NA,overseas stations which are powered with,75
NA,100 kilowatts are also operating. So I,75
NA,hope it will be appreciated that the problem,75
NA,"will not be an easy one. Nevertheless, I",75
NA,can assure honorable members from,75
NA,Western Australia-the y are all interested,75
NA,in this matter-tha t the board is fully cog-,75
NA,nisant of the difficulties of reception in that,75
NA,State and will continue to do its utmost to,75
NA,"improve these conditions, consistent with",75
NA,the funds available to it.,75
Mr BIRD ,Batman) [10.54] - I desire,75
NA,"to deal, under the Estimates for Miscelsomething",75
NA,"laneous Services, with the item, "" Colombo",75
NA,plan-Technica l assistance and economic,75
NA,"development, £4,700,000"". In recent",75
NA,months there has been some criticism,75
NA,"this plan. According to press reports,",75
NA,was a division in the ranks of the,75
NA,vernment about whether the amount should,75
NA,be reduced. Whether any credence should,75
NA,"be given to those reports I do not know,",75
NA,"but I am pleased that, if any pressure was",75
NA,exerted by a section of the Ministry,75
NA,"have the amount reduced, that pressure",75
NA,was resisted and that it is proposed that,75
NA,the same amount shall be spent on the,75
NA,Colombo plan in this financial year as,75
NA,spent in the last financial year.,75
NA,"I think, in view of the controversy that",75
NA,"has arisen, not only in the ranks of the",75
NA,"Cabinet but also among certain newspapers,",75
NA,that it is necessary to re-state the aim of,75
NA,the Colombo plan. The Colombo plan is,75
NA,a co-operative enterprise under which,75
NA,several of the more developed countries,75
NA,"of the world, including Australia, are assist-",75
NA,ing less developed countries in South and,75
NA,South-East Asia to raise their living stan-,75
NA,dards. The attitude of the Australian,75
NA,Labour party to this project is quite unequi-,75
NA,vocal. I wish to read a resolution which,75
NA,was passed last year by the famous Hobart,75
NA,conference-th e federal conference of the,75
NA,Labour party,75
NA,Mr Haworth -Whic h Labour party?,75
Mr BIRD ,Ther e is only one federal,75
NA,Labour party. Section 6 of the resolution,75
NA,of the conference reads as follows:-,75
NA,The Labour party advocates generous assist-,75
NA,ance by Australia to Asian peoples suffering from,75
NA,"poverty, disease and lack of educational",75
NA,facilities.,75
NA,That statement of Labour party policy is,75
NA,unambiguous. Despite any statement that,75
NA,"may be made to the contrary, that is our",75
NA,"policy and, as our federal policy, this party",75
NA,is bound to support it.,75
NA,The Colombo plan is a long-range plan.,75
NA,It is not necessarily of only twelve months',75
NA,"duration, and it is impossible to assess the",75
NA,result of the plan in the light of expenditure,75
NA,"in one year. It is easy to say, "" This sum of",75
NA,"nearly £5,000,000 should be devoted to",75
NA,"else "". I heard one member of",75
NA,"the Australian Country party say that,",75
NA,whilst he believed in assisting people over-,75
NA,"seas, he considered that charity began at",75
NA,of home. But I point out that charity does,75
NA,there not end at home. I suggest that this is,75
NA,Gocharity that could well be given by the,75
NA,Australian Government outside the confines,75
NA,of the Commonwealth of Australia itself.,75
NA,"At this stage, when the Colombo plan",75
NA,to is being discussed and examined by cer-,75
NA,"tain interested parties, I consider that the",75
NA,underlying motive for Australia's support,75
NA,of the plan should once again be enunciated.,75
NA,Some people say tbat its purpose is to make,75
NA,was Australia popular in the East. Others say,75
NA,that it is intended to buy Asian gratitude.,75
NA,"Then again, some people say that it is in-",76
NA,tended to stop the spread of communism,76
NA,in Asia. A fourth section of the com-,76
NA,munity asserts that it is an assurance for,76
NA,ourselves and an attempt to guarantee us,76
NA,allies in the event of some future conflict.,76
NA,If these are reasons that actuate the Go-,76
NA,"vernment in according support to the plan,",76
NA,we should not let it get out to the,76
NA,Asian people that they are the only,76
NA,reasons. A lot of the good work,76
NA,of the Colombo plan will be undone,76
NA,if the Asian people think that we are sup-,76
NA,porting the plan merely in order to achieve,76
NA,"base, materialistic gains for this country.",76
NA,We shall delude ourselves dangerously if,76
NA,we think that the giving of aid for these,76
NA,reasons will gain for us permanent Asian,76
NA,"friendship. We have to recognize, if we",76
NA,"want to understand the Asian mind, that",76
NA,the Asian countries have developed an,76
NA,"abnormal, if quite understandable, sensi-",76
NA,tivity to any signs of patronage on the part,76
NA,of Western Powers.,76
NA,Under the provisions of the Colombo,76
NA,"plan, Australia is providing material and",76
NA,technical assistance. I regret to say that,76
NA,that assistance has often been received by,76
NA,the recipients with distrust and suspicion.,76
NA,"That is to be deplored, but the fact that",76
NA,some of the Asian people apparently mis-,76
NA,trust our motives in giving them equipment,76
NA,and in providing technical assistance is no,76
NA,reason why we should reduce our aid.,76
NA,Nobody really believes that genuine friend-,76
NA,ship between countries will follow auto-,76
NA,matically the mere act of one country,76
NA,giving another some capital equipment or,76
NA,technical assistance. We must impress on,76
NA,the Asian people that Australia is genuinely,76
NA,"sympathetic, to their struggle and their",76
NA,resolve to create new standards of living.,76
NA,If we cannot impress that salient factor on,76
NA,"the Asian people, the whole basis of the",76
NA,Colombo plan will fail as far as they are,76
NA,concerned. Unless we can secure their,76
NA,genuine friendship and unless they can be,76
NA,sure that vfe are actuated by humanitarian,76
NA,"motives in relation to their problems, all",76
NA,money that we can pour into the Colombo,76
NA,plan will be so much money wasted.,76
NA,I think that the Government and the,76
NA,people of Australia are of the opinion-,76
NA,and the Labour party is certainly of the,76
NA,opinion-tha t we must help the people,76
NA,"Asia, and recognize their problems wbich",76
NA,they are unable to combat. We can do,76
NA,"our share, as a nation, to assist them in",76
NA,their long and upward struggle. While it,76
NA,is quite easy to support the plan from an,76
NA,"emotional or sentimental angle, a sober",76
NA,appraisement of the achievement to date,76
NA,shows that although progress has been made,76
NA,in some directions there is still a tremen-,76
NA,dous amount to be achieved before any,76
NA,large-scale success can be reported. For,76
NA,"example, the latest report of the consulta-",76
NA,tive committee-th e reports are issued,76
NA,annually and I always read them avidly,76
NA,when they are distributed to members-,76
NA,shows that in a number of countries there,76
NA,have been improvements in the fields of,76
NA,"agriculture, irrigation, power, and com-",76
NA,munity development programmes. Expen-,76
NA,"diture on health, education, housing, and",76
NA,"other social services has continued to rise,",76
NA,despite financial stringency in a number of,76
NA,countries. The technical assistance scheme,76
NA,"has prospered. Last year, for example, a",76
NA,record number of Asian trainees was sent,76
NA,abroad. It would not be a bad idea if we,76
NA,reciprocated the visits of Asian students to,76
NA,Australia by sending a number of Aus-,76
NA,tralian students to the Colombo plan coun-,76
NA,tries. The universities of India and Indo-,76
NA,nesia would be only too pleased to receive,76
NA,a token number of Australian students who,76
NA,could take courses at those universities. I,76
NA,am certain that a visit by perhaps only 20,76
NA,or 30 students would create a profound,76
NA,effect on the Eastern mind.,76
NA,Public investment in the Colombo plan,76
NA,"countries continues to increase. Last year,",76
NA,"it reached £723,000,000 sterling, as com-",76
NA,"pared with £540,000,000 sterling in the pre-",76
NA,"vious year. Unfortunately, private invest-",76
NA,"ment, which was intended to be a large",76
NA,factor in the Colombo plan has not risen,76
NA,to the extent to which we hoped it would,76
NA,rise. The United Nations research com-,76
NA,"mittee, which made a study of the needs of",76
NA,"the Asian people in the investment field,",76
NA,"stated that about £5,000,000,000 of new",76
NA,investment annually was required to jolt the,76
NA,the Asian people out of their chronic poverty.,76
NA,"Of course, that objective is far outside our",76
NA,"capacity to attain, so it would therefore",76
NA,"appear that for the time being, in the main,",76
NA,the Colombo plan must rely on public in-,76
NA,vestment and that governmental assistance,76
NA,"by the donor nations, including Australia,",76
NA,of must be the main prop of the plan.,76
NA,"On the debit side, of which we must take",77
NA,"particular notice, because it is of no use to",77
NA,delude ourselves that everything is rosy with,77
NA,"the plan, the population in recipient coun-",77
NA,"tries is increasing at the rate of 10,000,000",77
NA,"persons a year, and this increase has com-",77
NA,plicated the position. When health and,77
NA,social services decrease the infant mortality,77
NA,"rate in those countries, as they will in a",77
NA,"short space of time, the rate of population",77
NA,increase can be expected to accelerate. The,77
NA,expected reduction in this mortality rate,77
NA,will cause the rate of population increase,77
NA,"to rise from 10,000,000 to probably",77
NA,"12,000,000 or 15,000,000 a year. This will",77
NA,more than balance the increase in food pro-,77
NA,duction in the area as a result of the plan.,77
NA,"In other words, the tangible benefits of the",77
NA,plan are being wiped out by the unfore-,77
NA,"seen circumstance, if I may use the term,",77
NA,"of a rapid increase in population. To-day,",77
NA,"despite the operation of the plan, the tragic",77
NA,fact remains that Asians are eating less per,77
NA,head of population than they were eating,77
NA,before the war. That is tragic because we,77
NA,had hoped that as a result of the plan they,77
NA,"would eat more; actually, because of the",77
NA,"increase in population, they are eating less.",77
NA,Not only has the increase in population more,77
NA,or less cut across the basic purposes of the,77
NA,"plan, but also Asia's booming population",77
NA,has added to the severity of the unemploy-,77
NA,"ment problem. Unfortunately, the main",77
NA,impact of the Colombo plan has been in,77
NA,"the rural sector, and therefore there has",77
NA,been little effect upon the level of employ-,77
NA,ment in recipient countries. Over the last,77
NA,four years India's industrial production has,77
NA,increased by 40 per cent. This is a con-,77
NA,siderable increase in a period of four years.,77
NA,"Unfortunately, however, there has been no",77
NA,increase in employment in factories.,77
NA,Because of the introduction of technical,77
NA,"processes, production has increased without",77
NA,any increase in the work force.,77
NA,One of the great drawbacks of the,77
NA,"-an d it may well founder on this, unless",77
NA,solution is found-i s that the recipient,77
NA,tries suffer from fluctuating prices for their,77
NA,staple raw materials which are exported.,77
NA,"For example, in the last year or so, the",77
NA,"overseas price of rice fell, which had",77
NA,adverse effect upon the economies of,77
NA,"exporting countries. The prices of hemp,",77
NA,"copra, raw cotton and tin also fell.",77
NA,"the credit side, however, the export prices",77
NA,"of rubber, tea and jute were higher than",77
NA,formerly. So there is a fluctuating group of,77
NA,"economies whose prosperity, to use the term",77
NA,"in a very relative, negative sense, rises or",77
NA,falls in accordance with the world prices,77
NA,received for their exports.,77
NA,Existing statistical data does not permit,77
NA,very any exact and reliable measure of the real,77
NA,"economic development under the plan, but",77
NA,the general picture revealed by the last,77
NA,report of the consultative committee shows,77
NA,that there has been but limited progress.,77
NA,"This is rather disappointing, but neverthe-",77
NA,less some progress must be reported. One,77
NA,fact: stands out like a beacon on a head-,77
NA,"land. Despite the impact of the plan, Asian",77
NA,economies remain precariously poised be-,77
NA,tween low productivity and high and rapidly,77
NA,increasing population. These economies,77
NA,wiil never be able to withstand the effects,77
NA,of a run of bad seasons or a mild world,77
NA,"recession. In these circumstances, it is not",77
NA,unreasonable to expect that the Colombo,77
NA,plan in its next phase will have to provide,77
NA,for a high rale of economic aid. There,77
NA,"must be a next phase, and further phases,",77
NA,because I should say that the plan will on,77
NA,present indications have to operate for al,77
NA,hast 20 or 30 years if we wish to reach,77
NA,ultimately the basis which we originaUy,77
NA,sought to attain. There will have to be,77
NA,"heavier investment in most countries, if",77
NA,productivity and national income are to be,77
NA,further increased. There is urgent need,77
NA,for new capital projects to accommodate,77
NA,the growing labour force. The rate of,77
NA,technical assistance will have to be stepped,77
NA,up if additional foreign aid is lo be ab-,77
NA,sorbed. It is not a bit of good giving aid,77
NA,in the form of either private or govern-,77
NA,ment investment to provide modern,77
NA,machines if the technical knowledge neces-,77
NA,sary for the operation of those machines,77
NA,is not available locally. I would say that,77
NA,"the plan, despite the carping criticism that",77
NA,"plan has been directed at it, is based upon",77
NA,a humanitarian aims and it should be sup-,77
NA,counported by all of the Australian people.,77
Mr CLEAVER ,Swan) [11.9] - I wish,77
NA,"an to direct my comments to Division No. 222,",77
NA,"riceDepartment of Health, Item 3, "" Common-",77
NA,wealth Council for National Fitness.,77
NA,"On £72,500"". In the first place, I want to",77
NA,"remind the committee, by a quick reference",77
NA,to the history of the national fitness move-,78
NA,"ment, of the outstanding value of this",78
NA,organization to the nation. The movement,78
NA,was estabhshed under the Commonwealth,78
NA,National Fitness Act of 1941. We should,78
NA,"appreciate, therefore, that it came into",78
NA,being at a time when the nation was engaged,78
NA,in war. The attention of the Common-,78
NA,"wealth was, no doubt, centred on the need",78
NA,to build the youth of Australia into young,78
NA,men and women who were as fit as it was,78
NA,"possible for them to be, so that from that",78
NA,valuable source the nation might draw,78
NA,people suited to the needs of the times.,78
NA,The National Fitness Act was passed in,78
NA,"1941, and the vote provided by the Com-",78
NA,monwealth naturally was experimental; but,78
NA,within three years it was increased sub-,78
NA,"stantially to £72,500. That was the amount",78
NA,"of the vote in 1944. 1 make the point that,",78
NA,"from 1944 to the present time, there has",78
NA,been no addition to the vote. So far as I,78
NA,"can see, this vote, with the exception of",78
NA,the National Service Training Scheme and,78
NA,"several grants to certain organizations, is",78
NA,the only direct contribution to the welfare,78
NA,of the youth of the nation.,78
NA,I have spoken previously in this chamber,78
NA,about the responsibility of the Common-,78
NA,wealth to consider the needs of our youth.,78
NA,A government that fails to recognize that,78
NA,young men and women need to be given,78
NA,every encouragement surely overlooks one,78
NA,of its fundamental tasks. Is it possible to,78
NA,"justify the attitude, on the part of a federal",78
NA,"government, that this vote need not be",78
NA,increased and that the States should do,78
NA,"more, either through their education depart-",78
NA,ments or by way of grants to the national,78
NA,fitness organization? Can we justify leaving,78
NA,this field of activity to the States alone?,78
NA,"Is it not true that, since the National Fitness",78
NA,Act emanated from the National Parlia-,78
NA,"ment here at Canberra, other nationally",78
NA,based plans might well be adopted? I,78
NA,"believe that it is. At the present time, the",78
NA,Government of Victoria is concerned-an d,78
NA,rightly so-wit h the problem of vandalism.,78
NA,If honorable members have read their news-,78
NA,"papers during the last few days, they will",78
NA,share the concern of that government. A,78
NA,"grant of £20,000 to train youth leaders is",78
NA,being considered by the Victorian Parlia-,78
NA,ment in connexion with the Youth Orga-,78
NA,nizations Assistance Bill. I affirm that there,78
NA,is no need for a new committee to be,78
NA,"appointed in Victoria, or elsewhere, to pro-",78
NA,vide assistance of this kind for the youth,78
NA,"of Australia. In each State, the national",78
NA,fitness organization has an associated youth,78
NA,committee which acts as an extremely valu-,78
NA,able co-ordinating body with voluntary,78
NA,"youth organizations. Victoria, like other",78
NA,"States, has a most efficient national fitness",78
NA,"organization. Only last Friday evening, I",78
NA,understand that the honorabie member for,78
NA,Wills ( Mr Bryant) was invited to attend the,78
NA,re-opening of a youth centre in the Mel-,78
NA,"bourne suburb of Brunswick, and, on Mon-",78
NA,"day last, it was my privilege to be taken, as",78
NA,"a visitor, to see the same centre at which,",78
NA,"on Saturday, no less than 250 young people",78
NA,had been in attendance. 1 was delighted to,78
NA,see this practical approach towards helping,78
NA,"the young men and women of what I may,",78
NA,"perhaps, describe as a very difficult district,",78
NA,by providing training in hobbies such as,78
NA,"photography and woodwork, and in a",78
NA,"variety of other ways, to employ their time",78
NA,sensibly and usefully.,78
NA,"The vote of £72,500, to which I have",78
NA,"referred, has been allocated this year, as in",78
NA,"recent years, as follows:-Th e various State",78
NA,"councils will absorb £36,954; the State",78
NA,education departments will receive grants,78
NA,"totalling £17,000; the universities will re-",78
NA,"ceive £12,400; the central administrative",78
NA,"office here in Canberra will require £3,396;",78
NA,"and the balance of £2,750 has been allo-",78
NA,cated for work within the Australian Capital,78
NA,Territory. It is significant that there is a,78
NA,"relationship, in this allocation, to educa-",78
NA,"tional institutions of the States, in the form",78
NA,of State education departments and uni-,78
NA,versities. I have every respect for the,78
NA,Minister for Health (Dr Donald Cameron),78
NA,and for the national fitness officer in charge,78
NA,"of this important division, but I pose the",78
NA,question whether the National Fitness,78
NA,Council is well placed strategically under,78
NA,the administration of the Minister for,78
NA,Health and the Department of Health. Be-,78
NA,cause its operations are related almost,78
NA,"entirely to the field of youth, I claim that",78
NA,it could be better administered by the Com-,78
NA,monwealth Office of Education. If that,78
NA,"were so, surely matters pertaining to the",78
NA,activities of youth would receive keener,78
NA,scrutiny and wider understanding.,78
NA,If we turn to the last printed report of,78
NA,"the National Fitness Council, we find, at",78
NA,"page 5, a reference to Australian represennumber",79
NA,"tation at international youth conferences,",79
NA,and in that connexion 1 want to make a,79
NA,very important point. The committee will,79
NA,appreciate that Australian representation,79
NA,international youth conferences is dealt with,79
NA,in the report of a council which is adminislems,79
NA,tered by the Department of Health. If,79
NA,honorable members have an opportunity to,79
NA,"look carefully at this section of the report,",79
NA,they will see that this matter has given,79
NA,concern to national fitness authorities,79
NA,"some years, particularly the associated",79
NA,committees which act as the co-ordinatnow,79
NA,ing bodies for the major voluntary,79
NA,youth organizations in each State. The,79
NA,report states that the lack of a national,79
NA,youth committee has prevented Australia,79
NA,from being affiliated with the international,79
NA,youth organization known as the World,79
NA,"Assembly of Youth, with which other counfor",79
NA,"tries of the West, and of the British Comrequirements.",79
NA,"monwealth, are affiliated. The report states",79
NA,that the second general assembly of,79
NA,"World Assembly of Youth was held in Apparently,",79
NA,"Singapore in August, 1954, and that",79
NA,tralia was invited to send delegates.,79
NA,Through the Commonwealth Office of Eduto,79
NA,"cation and the national fitness organization,",79
NA,two observers were nominated. Only two,79
NA,observers were sent because there were no employed.,79
NA,other organizations from which direct repre-,79
NA,sentatives of the youth of this country could,79
NA,"be sent. These two observers, on their",79
NA,"return to Australia, reported that their",79
NA,"participation in the meeting was valuable,",79
NA,but that it was considerably hampered,79
NA,lack of proper status as fully accredited,79
NA,delegates of Australia. I think we must,79
NA,"recognize that, because of the relationship",79
NA,"of national fitness to education, the Com-",79
NA,monwealth Office of Education is the most,79
NA,appropriate body to handle national fitness,79
NA,matters.,79
NA,The report of the national fitness,79
NA,organization convinces one of the value,79
NA,this body and indicates something of its,79
NA,"achievements. At the same time, it",79
NA,"lines the inadequacy of the vote, which,",79
NA,"I have said, has remained unaltered since",79
NA,"1944. The report, in referring to thc",79
NA,"achievements of the organization, mentions",79
NA,the continuing use of nationalfitnesscamps,79
NA,"for leadership training, and by youth",79
NA,organizations. It directs attention to,79
NA,need to promote physical recreation. The of that kind.,79
NA,of school camps and hostels has in-,79
NA,"creased in all States. In addition, there has",79
NA,been splendid co-ordination of youth activi-,79
NA,ties by each of the State councils. To,79
NA,at support my claim concerning the. inadequacy,79
NA,"of the vote, I invite attention to the prob-",79
NA,occasioned by shortage of finance.,79
NA,The various State governments have been,79
NA,called upon to supplement their grants sub-,79
NA,stantially because last year this Parliament,79
NA,"for decided that the vote of £72,500 could",79
NA,youth not be increased. New South Wales is,79
NA,"providing approximately £72,000, com-",79
NA,"pared with the Commonwealth grant, under",79
NA,"this vote, of £12,000. The report clearly",79
NA,indicates that the grants to universities,79
NA,which undertake physical education courses,79
NA,"are inadequate, as are the grants for State",79
NA,centres and youth head-quarters. Bursaries,79
NA,specialist training are also short of,79
NA,"I find, with interest, that",79
NA,the Tasmanian bursary has not been taken,79
NA,the up because it is only £400 per annum.,79
NA,it is not attractive to any one,79
NA,Auswho otherwise would be glad of bursary,79
NA,assistance. The amount of £484 granted,79
NA,"each State for books, films, records, and",79
NA,"so on, has been wholly expended, indicating",79
NA,that a larger amount could be usefully,79
NA,"In conclusion, I wish to recommend, first,",79
NA,the transfer of the National Fitness Division,79
NA,from the administration of the Department,79
NA,by of Health to that of the Commonwealth,79
NA,"Office of Education. Secondly, that the",79
NA,"vote of £72,500 for nationalfitnessshould",79
NA,"be increased, at the first opportunity, to at",79
NA,"least £150,000. I suggest, further, that",79
NA,grants to youth organizations should be,79
NA,substantially increased. The grants of,79
NA,"£3,000 in the State of New South Wales",79
NA,and of £600 in my own State of Western,79
NA,Australia represent only a very small pro-,79
NA,of portion of the funds needed to provide,79
NA,equipment and facilities for the training,79
NA,underof young people. I further recommend,79
NA,as greater activity among underprivileged,79
NA,"children, and the children of immigrants",79
NA,"and aborigines, so that camps may be orga-",79
NA,nized and free equipment and even uni-,79
NA,"forms may be issued to boy scouts, girl",79
NA,"the guides, and members of other organizations",79
NA,My final recommendation is that youth,80
NA,head-quarters should be set up in every,80
NA,capital city. Surely this country warrants,80
NA,central head-quarters for national fitness,80
NA,organizations to provide council and com-,80
NA,"mittee rooms, theatrettes and central youth",80
NA,group offices. These are essential in a is,80
NA,"country such as Australia, which has many duties?",80
NA,privileges and opportunities available to,80
NA,train young men and women. I urge the,80
NA,Government to recognize the need for makable,80
NA,"ing special grants, even greater than the",80
NA,"figures I have recommended, so that there",80
NA,may rise in every capital city of the as follows:-,80
NA,Commonwealth youth head-quarters in,80
NA,which a work second to none may be done.,80
NA,Progress reported.,80

NA,routes where the traffic is comparatively small.,81
NA,Australian National Airways and Trans-Australia,81

NA,"104; Adelaide, 7,284 Perth, 5,155; Hobart, 446;",82
NA,"Newcastle, 1,299. The relatively small number of",82
NA,outstanding applications in Brisbane is due mainly,82
NA,to the large amount of telephone plant provided,82
NA,for the armed forces in the war period which was,82
NA,available for normal purposes when hostilities,82
NA,"ceased, the lower rate of demand for services than",82
NA,in other capital cities and the availability of labour,82
NA,and building materials during post-war years when,82

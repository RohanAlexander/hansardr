NA,OTJBRENCY.,12
Mr DEAN ,Th e question that I,12
NA,address to the Treasurer arises from the,12
NA,judgment recently given in a case in,12
NA,"Melbourne, in which a person was",12
NA,acquitted of a charge of having counter-,12
NA,"feited coins because, in his defence, he",12
NA,said tihat the counterfeit coins would he,12
NA,used in the manufacture of jewellery. Is,12
NA,it possible for the Government to protect,12
NA,the genuine sovereign by causing an,12
NA,« -[14 ],12
NA,amendment to be made to the law so aa to,12
NA,make the counterfeiting of gold coinage a,12
NA,punishable offence ?,12
NA,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN Thia,12
NA,matter is at present the subject of,12
NA,inquiry by officers of the Treasury and,12
NA,the Attotirey-Geheral's Department.,12
NA,"As soon, as a feport is received",12
NA,from theAttorney-General's Depart-,12
NA,"ment, it will he considered by the",12
NA,"Government, which realizes tliat the",12
NA,counterfeiting of gold coins is 'a most,12
NA,important matter that affects not Only,12
NA,Australia but also other members of the,12
NA,British Commonwealth of Nations.,12
NA,BERRY FRUITS.,12
Mr DUTHIE , I remind the Minister,12
NA,for Commerce and Agriculture that a,12
NA,representative meeting of berry fruit,12
NA,interests and members of Patlia',12
NA,ment was held at Hobart on the 28th,12
NA,June last in order to prepare a case in,12
NA,favour of the granting of assistance to,12
NA,"the berry fruit industry in Tasmania,",12
NA,which is threatened with extinction. Can,12
NA,the right honorable gentleman tell me,12
NA,whether any progress is being made in,12
NA,response to representations that have been,12
NA,made to him for the revival and stabiliza-,12
NA,"tion of the industry, as well as for the",12
NA,discovery of new markets for berry,12
NA,fruits at economic prices? The farmers,12
NA,want to know what plans to make for,12
NA,the future.,12
NA,Mr MCEWEIf -Man y representa-,12
NA,tions have been made to the Government,12
NA,on behalf of the berry fruits industry. I n,12
NA,"fact, I can recall Offhand three deputa-",12
NA,tions of Government supporter S f f om both,12
NA,Houses that have been introduced to me.,12
NA,The Government some time ago gave,12
NA,consideration to specific proposals that,12
NA,"were made to it that, having regard to",12
NA,"the problems of certain berry growers,",12
NA,a subsidy Should be paid to them. The,12
NA,Government does not consider that prob-,12
NA,lems of this kind can be solved merely,12
NA,by thc payment of a subsidy ta,12
NA,those who are in need. There-,12
NA,"fore, a close study was made of tbo",12
NA,possibility of devising a commercial,12
NA,solution of the general problem. As,12
NA,a result of the activities of tbe Govern-,12
NA,"ment's trade commissioner service, an",12
NA,interested party was discovered in,12
NA,London and persuaded to come to Aus-,13
NA,- tralia. Last year he bought the whole of,13
NA,the black currant crop. This haa opened,13
NA,a completely new vista f o r the industry.,13
NA,Tbe policy that I have mentioned must,13
NA,continue to apply to the growers of otber,13
NA,"berries i n respect of which, a commercial",13
NA,solution has not yet been discovered.,13
NA,"However-, the person to whom I have",13
NA,referred will shortly visit Australia,13
NA,"again, I understand, and I am confident",13
NA,"that, as a result of the activities of the",13
NA,"trade commissioner service, there will be",13
NA,an opportunity for the expansion of our,13
NA,black currant industry at least.,13
NA,BROADCASTING.,13
Mr TURNER , I wish to make a,13
NA,personal explanation. I draw attention,13
NA,to amisleading report of a question that,13
NA,"I asked in this House yesterday, which",13
NA,appears in the Sydney Daily Telegraph,13
NA,to-day. I sball read first the question,13
NA,tbat I asked tbe Postmaster-General,13
NA,yesterday. I t was as follows:-,13
NA,"Is i t practicable, without interfering",13
NA,the democratic privilege of the Australian,13
NA,people to hear the proceedings of thc FarliaIndia,13
NA,. incut broadcast without the distortion and,13
NA,selective suppression that vitiates other,13
NA,"of public information, to transfer the",13
NA,or part of the Parliamentary broadcasts,13
NA,New South Wales radio stations either,13
NA,"third channel, if this is technically practi-",13
NA,"cable, or to a station or stations other",13
NA,"station 2BL, many of whose listeners, I",13
NA,"stand, prefer culture to controversy?",13
NA,A leading article i n this morning's,13
NA,"Daily Telegraph, under the beading",13
NA,""" Too gassy! "", i n which parliamentary",13
NA,"broadcasts were attacked, contains the",13
NA,following paragraph:-,13
NA,Parliamentary broadcasts originally were,13
NA,interesting experiment: but i t was an,13
NA,"ment that failed.. As Mr turner (Lib.,",13
NA,N.S.W.) said yesterday the people prefer,13
NA,culture to controversy.,13
NA,I do not need to add anything to my,13
NA,question to show tbat tbe leading article,13
NA,in tbe Daily Telegraph is completely,13
NA,misleading. I wont out of my way,13
NA,"indicate that, ns f a r as I was concerned,",13
NA,parliamentary proceedings sbould,13
NA,"broadcast, but I pointed out that this",13
NA,"should he done through a third channel,",13
NA,or a station or stations otber than,13
NA,Tbere eould be no better example of the,13

NA,ABROAD.,13
Mr WATKINS , I preface a ques-,13
NA,tion to the Mmister for External Affairs,13
NA,by reminding bim that the Department,13
NA,of External Affairs acquired from tbe,13
NA,Indian Government a perpetual lease of,13
NA,approximately twelve acres of land in tbe,13
NA,"diplomatic area in New Delhi, India,",13
NA,for tbe erection of offices and residences,13
NA,for the Australian H i gh Commissioner,13
NA,"and bis staff. A premium of £95,000",13
NA,"was paid for the lease. ""Will tbe Minister",13
NA,inform me of thc progress that bas been,13
NA,"made i n tbe erection of tbe buildings, the",13
NA,"present position i n tbis matter, and tbe",13
NA,expenditure to date?,13
Mr CASEY , Speaking from,13

NA,SEX OFFENDERS .,13
Mr DRUMMOND , I direct a ques-,13
NA,"tion to the Minister, for Health. ReportB",13
NA,have appeared i n our newspapers from,13
NA,an time to time of tbe activities of sexual,13
NA,"experiperverts, and tbe custom of treating",13
NA,tbem as ordinary offenders and then,13
NA,"letting them loose on tbe community, I",13
NA,7-ofer particularly to attacks 'by perverts,13

NA,be institution of a concerted attempt to,13
NA,remove tbis blot upon our social system,13
NA,"and our record as a civilized nation, so",13
NA,2BL. tbat these offenders may be treated as,13
NA,"mentally diseased persons, not as persons",13
NA,that wbo sbould be dealt with under tbe,13
Sir EARLE PAGE ,Th e honorable,14
NA,"member should know quite well that,",14
NA,except in relation to the Australian,14
NA,Capital Territory and the Northern,14
NA,"Territory, the matter that he has raised",14
NA,is within the control of the State,14
NA,governments and I understand that con-,14
NA,siderable attention has been given to this,14
NA,"problem in the States, but without a",14
NA,proper solution of it having been found.,14
NA,COMMONWEALTH BANK.,14
Mr COSTA , I ask the Treasurer,14
NA,whether it is true that many clients of the,14
NA,Commonwealth Bank are transferring,14
NA,their business accounts to private banks,14
NA,because the Commonwealth Bank is,14
NA,refusing to give loan and overdraft,14
NA,accommodation for legitimate business,14
NA,dealings. Is it also true that people who,14
NA,seek from the Commonwealth Bank,14
NA,nnanciai aid for home building are turned,14
NA,"away, and advised to apply to private",14
NA,"banks for it whilst, conversely, the Com-",14
NA,monwealth Bank is prepared to lend the,14
NA,same people money for the purchase of,14
NA,"Holden motor cars? I f these are facts,",14
NA,will the Treasurer instruct the manage-,14
NA,ment of the Commonwealth Bank to,14
NA,"cease this unwise practice, and see that",14
NA,the people's bank performs the proper,14
NA,function for which it was founded by the,14
NA,Fisher Labour Government?,14
Sir ARTHUR FADDEN , I should,14
NA,be surprised i f the circumstances stated,14
NA,by the honorable gentleman are based on,14
NA,"fact. However, I shall inquire into the",14
NA,matter and let him know the position.,14
NA,DUTCH NEW GUINEA.,14
Dr DONALD CAMERON ,Wil l the,14
NA,Minister for External Affairs comment,14
NA,on the request made by the Government,14
NA,of Indonesia that the problem of the,14
NA,sovereignty of West New Guinea be dis-,14
NA,cussed by the General Assembly of the,14
NA,United Nations? Is he of the opinion,14
NA,that a satisfactory solution of the problem,14
NA,can be found in that way? Does he con-,14
NA,sider that the extensive economic and,14
NA,administrative difficulties with which the,14
NA,Government of Indonesia is already con-,14
NA,fronted will permit that government to,14
NA,exercise over West New Guinea a,14
NA,sovereignty that will be conducive to poli-,14
NA,"tical stability in that area, or indeed, to",14
NA,the best interests of the native inhabitants,14
NA,"of it? Does the Minister agree that,",14
NA,whilst Australia desires to have the most,14
NA,"friendly relations with Indonesia, we are",14
NA,"bound, in the interests of our own security",14
NA,to be concerned about the sovereignty,14
NA,of that area?,14
Mr CASEY ,Th e Australian Govern-,14
NA,ment's attitude towards Dutch New,14
NA,Guinea has been frequently the subject,14
NA,"of precise and distinct expression by me,",14
NA,"on behalf of the Government, the last",14
NA,"occasion, I think, being in a chapter of",14
NA,a book which I wrote and published only,14
NA,"a few months ago, which dealt with, I",14
NA,"believe, every point of view on this matter,",14
NA,"I hope, in a fair way. On many occasions",14
NA,"previous to that one, I had stated, on",14
NA,"behalf of the Government, Australia's",14
NA,view of the matter. I said on these occa-,14
NA,sions that it was the clear and distinct,14
NA,view of the Australian Government that,14
NA,sovereignty in Dutch New Guinea resides,14
NA,.in the Government of the Netherlands.,14
NA,"I n saying so, I expressed, and still",14
NA,express the firm opinion of the Govern-,14
NA,ment and the opinion of the whole of,14
NA,"the Australian people, as frequently",14
NA,reflected in the press when this matter,14
NA,becomes a live issue. I fail to see that,14
NA,any good purpose could be served by this,14
NA,"matter being taken to the United Nations,",14
NA,and I think I forecast the attitude of the,14
NA,Government by saying that we shall resist,14
NA,the matter being included in the agenda,14
NA,for the forthcoming meeting of the,14
NA,"General Assembly. However, it may be",14
NA,beyond Australia's power to prevent it,14
NA,from being discussed at the United,14
NA,Nations. I f and when it is discussed we,14
NA,"shall again, with force but, I hope, with-",14
NA,"out heat, express our view of it. Dutch",14
NA,New Guinea is of very great strategic,14
NA,importance to Australia. We believe that,14
NA,"the legal facts of the case, going right",14
NA,back to the sittings of the round table,14
NA,"conference a number of years ago, are",14
NA,that the Dutch made their position com-,14
NA,pletely clear and that Dutch New Guinea,14
NA,was excluded from what was then the,14
NA,"Netherlands East Indies, in connexion",14
NA,with the transfer of the sovereignty of,14
NA,those islands from the Dutch to the,14
NA,"Indonesians. However, I do not wish to",14
NA,"canvass, in answer to a question, or even",14
NA,"attempt to canvass, everything that could",14
NA,be said about this issue. I think one,14
NA,"could say, without any disrespect to the",14
NA,"Indonesian Government, that the inter-",15
NA,ests of the native population would be,15
NA,very much better served under Dutch,15
NA,administration than under Indonesian,15
NA,administration. I hasten to add,15
NA,that I express that opinion without,15
NA,intending disrespect to the Indonesian,15
NA,Government. I base i t on the existence,15
NA,of the great series of problems with which,15
NA,the Indonesian Government is faced,15
NA,throughout its territory.,15
Mr HAYLEN , I direct to the Prime,15
NA,Minister a question on Dutch New,15
NA,.Guinea that is supplementary to the,15
NA,question addressed to the Minister,15
NA,for External Affairs. Will the Prime,15
NA,Minister make a bold statement of Aus-,15
NA,tralia's policy in relation to Dutch New,15
NA,"Guinea, pointing out that the Australian",15
NA,people have no interest in non-existent,15
NA,"problems of self-determination, colonial-",15
NA,ism and ethnology? The Minister for,15
NA,"External Affairs, in answer to the earlier",15
NA,"question, said that the matter will not bo",15
NA,referred to the TJnited Nations. I n view,15
NA,"of that answer, I ask whether the Go-",15
NA,vernment has considered purchasing,15
NA,Dutch New Guinea in the manner in,15
NA,which the United States of America,15
NA,negotiated what is known as the,15
NA,"Louisiana purchase, and the acquisition",15
NA,"of Alaska and Florida, payment to the",15
NA,Dutch to be made in goods and services,15
NA,for the rehabilitation of the East Indies?,15
Mr MENZIES , I appreciate and,15
NA,welcome the Opposition's new-found,15
NA,solicitude for the position of the Dutch.,15
NA,The honorable member's question is sup-,15
NA,plementary to one addressed to the,15
NA,"Minister for External Affairs, who",15
NA,repeatedly has stated the Australian Go-,15
NA,vernment's attitude in unequivocal terms.,15
NA,The Cabinet entirely subscribes to the,15
NA,statement my right honorable colleague,15
NA,has made.,15
NA,SECUEITY.,15
Mr WARD , I desire to ask the,15
NA,"Prime Minister whether, since the estab-",15
NA,lishment of the Commonwealth Security,15
NA,"Service, it has been the practice for both",15
NA,the Prime Minister and the Leader of the,15
NA,Opposition to be kept fully and promptly,15
NA,informed of any important developments,15
NA,"affecting national security? I f so, has",15
NA,the practice been invariably followed?,15
NA,I f there have been any departures from,15
NA,it will the Prime Minister state whether,15
NA,"they were made by his direction,",15
NA,"approval, or knowledge?",15
Mr MENZIES , I have not failed to,15
NA,observe that a royal commission has been,15
NA,invited to consider some matters of this,15
NA,kind. I propose to adopt the practice of,15
NA,not discussing on the floor of this House,15
NA,matters which are the concern of that,15
NA,"royal commission. I hope that, the House",15
NA,will agree with that view because i f 1,15
NA,have to depart from it I shall not be the,15
NA,one to be sorry.,15
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Ca n the,15
NA,Prime Minister say whether it is a fact,15
NA,that thc telephone conversations of,15
NA,reputable citizens of this country are,15
NA,still being tapped by officers of the Com-,15
NA,monwealth security service? I f that is,15
NA,"so, will the right honorable gentleman",15
NA,take steps to limit this totalitarian prac-,15
NA,tice to persons whom a Supreme Court,15
NA,judge is satisfied may be engaged in,15
NA,espionage activities ?,15
Mr MENZIES , I do not know,15
Mr CURTIN ,Wha t does the right,15
NA,honorable gentleman know?,15
Mr MENZIES ,I f I said everything,15
NA,"I knew, the honorable member for Watson",15
NA,would not be here. I n answer to the,15
NA,"question, I offer the observation that",15
NA,counter espionage is not a simple matter,15
NA,and is not one to be discussed in public,15
NA,while espionage goes on in private. I,15
NA,shall be no party to its public discussion.,15
NA,INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.,15
Mr BOSTOCK ,Wil l the Minister,15
NA,for External Affairs state the generally,15
NA,"accepted meaning of the word "" contain-",15
NA,"ment "" as used by the United States",15
NA,authorities in relation to their policy,15
NA,towards the Soviet Union?,15
Mr CASEY ," I think that the term,",15
NA,""" policy of containment"", arose six or",15
NA,seven years ago in the United States of,15
NA,America. I believe it to mean that the,15
NA,United States of America would seek to,15
NA,resist any further incursions by interna-,15
NA,tional communism into the territories of,15
NA,the democracies. I believe it reflects a,15
NA,"policy of "" thus far and no farther "". I",15
NA,do not want to be led into an attempt to,15

NA,"out, however, that we fix the ceiling",17
NA,freight rates and it is a matter for the,17
NA,airline operators to decide how far under,17
NA,the ceiling their charges will be. They,17
NA,make their own arrangements. I shall be,17
NA,pleased to let the honorable member have,17
NA,the rates on specific items i f he asks for,17
NA,them.,17
NA,Later:,17
Mr RIORDAN , I desire to ask,17
NA,the Minister for Civil Aviation a,17
NA,question that is supplementary to a,17
NA,question asked by the honorable member,17
NA,for Leichhardt. I preface my question,17
NA,by pointing out that I have received a,17
NA,number of telegrams of protest against,17
NA,the drastic action of Australian National,17
NA,Airways Proprietary Limited in substan-,17
NA,tially increasing the air freight on news-,17
NA,papers carried from Brisbane to centres,17
NA,in northern and western Queensland.,17
NA,"I n consequence, there has been a substan-",17
NA,tial increase of the price of newspapers to,17
NA,meetresidents in those districts. Will the,17
NA,Minister have the matter investigated with,17
NA,a view to a restoration of the freight,17
NA,charges to their former level as the new,17
NA,impost is another penalty on the long-,17
NA,the suffering public of northern and western,17
NA,Queensland and amounts to exploitation.,17
Mr TOWNLEY ,Th e suggestion that,17
NA,Australian National Airways Proprietary,17
NA,Limited is responsible for the increased,17
NA,charges is wrong and the honorable mem-,17
NA,"ber's statement, therefore, gives a false",17
NA,impression. Both the airlines concerned,17
NA,impose the same scale of charges. My,17
NA,department has had access to the books of,17
NA,"both companies, and it is satisfied that the",17
NA,rise of 5 per eent. was justified. News-,17
NA,"papers are regarded as freight, and they",17
NA,are transported by air at the same freight,17
NA,rates as those that are charged for other,17
NA,supcargo. The department is satisfied that,17
NA,the charges are just and equitable and,17
NA,both companies are in agreement upon,17
NA,them.,17
Mr WENTWORTH , Does the,17
NA,Minister for Air and Minister for Civil,17
NA,Aviation agree that the helicopter has,17
NA,now established itself as a practicable,17
NA,"instrument for certain purposes, in both",17
NA,peace and war? Has the honorable,17
NA,gentleman had ah opportunity of perus-,17
NA,ing a recent statement by the British Min-,17
NA,ister for War in relation to the increas-,17
NA,ing reliance by the British defence forces,17
NA,upon this form of aviation? Does the,17
NA,Minister agree that in Australia helicop-,17
NA,ters should be considered for two special,17
NA,uses-fo r defence against submarines,17
NA,"operating off the coast, and in prospect-",17
NA,ing for uranium? Is it a fact that very,17
NA,few helicopters are available in Australia,17
NA,"at present, and that for some technical",17
NA,reason the few available machines are,17
NA,"usually grounded? I f that is so, will the",17
NA,"Minister consider the whole matter and,",17
NA,if necessary; confer upon it with his col-,17
NA,"leagues, the Minister for the Navy and",17
NA,"Minister for the Army, and the Minister",17
NA,"for Supply, and ascertain whether Aus-",17
NA,tralian poliey should be re-orientated,17
NA,with a view to increasing the use of,17
NA,helicopters for the purposes that I have,17
NA,mentioned ?,17
Mr TOWNLEY , The honorable,18
NA,member's questions have covered a tre-,18
NA,mendous amount of ground. The helicop-,18
NA,"ter, as I think every one will agree, has",18
NA,"an enormous potential, but at present the",18
NA,machine is still in the experimental stage.,18
NA,Australia has had a small number of,18
NA,"helicopters for service evaluation, and",18
NA,"experience ""of them has not been happy.",18
NA,Their use in searching for mineral,18
NA,"deposits, as the honorable member has",18
NA,"suggested, would probably be a matter for",18
NA,"the State governments, except in relation",18
NA,to Commonwealth territories. We must,18
NA,appreciate the many limitations of the,18
NA,"helicopter. I t is a short-range machine,",18
NA,which cannot be flown in cloud. I n,18
NA,bad weather i t becomes very hazardous,18
NA,and consequently almost useless. TJie,18
NA,helicopter is very costly and its main-,18
NA,tenance expense is almost prohibitive.,18
NA,"I n spite of these shortcomings, there is",18
NA,much merit in the suggestions that may,18
NA,be inferred from the honorable member's,18
NA,"questions, and I shall be pleased to discuss",18
NA,the matter in detail with technical officers,18
NA,of the Department of Air and the Depart-,18
NA,ment of Civil Aviation.,18
NA,"NORTHERN"" TERRITORY.",18
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,Ca n the Minister,18
NA,for Territories inform the House of the,18
NA,position that will exist under the new,18
NA,ordinances in the Northern Territory,18
NA,wben a person who was granted a 99,18
NA,"years' lease as a resident owner, desires to",18
NA,sell his lease? Will companies be per-,18
NA,"mitted to purchase such leases? I f not,",18
NA,will this not destroy the value of the asset,18
NA,and deter banks from advancing loans to,18
NA,such lessees ?,18
Mr HASLUCK ,Th e condition con-,18
NA,tained in the Crown Lands Ordinance in,18
NA,respect of pastoral homestead leases is,18
NA,that they can be transferred only to an,18
NA,approved person. More favorable condi-,18
NA,tions are given to the resident owner than,18
NA,"to the non-resident owner, and to re-",18
NA,tain those conditions it is necessary that,18
NA,the terms on which they are granted,18
NA,should be continued. The point whieh,18
NA,the honorable member for Farrer ob-,18
NA,viously has in mind concerns the situation,18
NA,which might arise i f a person who held a,18
NA,pastoral homestead lease were to die or,18
NA,retire from the lease for a less drastic,18
NA,cause and i f the value of his estate were,18
NA,affected by the fact that i t could be trans-,18
NA,ferred only to an approved person. That,18
NA,problem is engaging the attention of our,18
NA,advisers at the present time. We wish to,18
NA,make sure that the ordinance will have the,18
NA,"effect which it is intended to have, which",18
NA,is to give more favorable conditions to,18
NA,the resident owner and that in doing so it,18
NA,will not in any way penalize him or reduce,18
NA,the value of his security in comparison,18
NA,with the value of the security which a,18
NA,company would have.,18
NA,DEFENCE.,18
Mr MAKIN ,Ha s the attention of,18
NA,the Minister for Defence been drawn to a,18
NA,statement made by the president of the,18
NA,"Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Vine, in",18
NA,"the course of which, when referring to",18
NA,certain industries,18
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,18
NA,able gentleman should not use the name,18
NA,of a person when asking a question. That,18
NA,has become out of order since he was pre-,18
NA,viously a member of the House.,18
Mr MAKIN , I wish to know whether,18
NA,there is any truth in the statement of the,18
NA,president of the Chamber of Manu-,18
NA,factures that our defence industries are i n,18
NA,a condition that is frightening and may,18
NA,not be able to meet the requirements of,18
NA,the country in the event of another war.,18
NA,Has the Minister a reassuring statement,18
NA,to make to the House and the country,18
NA,generally on this matter ?,18
Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE , I did not,18
NA,see the statement referred to by the,18
NA,"honorable member, but I am positive that",18
NA,any suggestion that the condition of our,18
NA,industries is bad can be disproved by the,18
NA,facts. I state as one example the iron,18
NA,".and steel industries which, after all, aro",18
NA,the basis of our defence activities. I t is,18
NA,necessary only to look at the recent balance,18
NA,sheets of organizations which produce iron,18
NA,and steel for proof that such a statement,18
NA,as that to which the honorable member has,18
NA,referred is not correct.,18

NA,mostly on young people whose .faces had,19
NA,been wholly or partially -destroyed by,19
NA,some of the dreadful diseases that .exist,19
NA,in that part' of the world. The visit arose,19
NA,from the fact 'that a young Malayan boy,19
NA,"'had been serit, as the result of a public",19
NA,"subscription, to Australia 'to have his face",19
NA,restored. The operation was very success-,19

NA,to meet fhe demand. I n New South Wales,19

NA,Mr TOWNLEY:- r know that work,20
NA,"has been done, with radio-active isotopes",20
NA,"as the honorable member, has indicated,",20
NA,but the problem is a fairly technical one.,20
NA,I believe that the isotopes that are. now,20
NA,available are more useful in connexion,20
NA,with the construction of aircraft than,20
NA,"in the. routine inspections, for. air-",20
NA,"worthiness and'similar tests. I n addition,",20
NA,most aircraft are constructed either of,20
NA,"aluminium, or magnesium alloys, and the",20
NA,conventional X-ray or gamma ray lias,20
NA,been found fo be more suitable for tests,20
NA,of those metals than the new radio-active,20
NA,isotopes. The use of isotopes is. prin-,20
NA,cipally confined to iron and steel and,20
NA,similar metals. Aircraft are complex,20
NA,structures and cannot be pulled to pieces,20
NA,and' put together again. Radio-active,20
NA,isotopes cannot be used i n a practical,20
NA,way* f o r the examination of the riveting,20
NA,and wielding of an aircraft. Australian,20
NA,airlines have a record for freedom from,20

NA,standards of inspection are very high.,20
NA,Those standards are not fixed by the,20
NA,companies who fly the aircraft but by the,20
NA,Department of Civil Aviation and the,20
NA,maintenance routines and schedules are,20
NA,"very strict., The aeronautical research",20
NA,"laboratories are doing, some work on the",20

NA,levy paid by wineries and distilleries on,21

NA,"ducing wine, brandy and distillation",21
NA,spirit. The levy is collected by the,21
NA,Department of Commerce and Agriculby,21
NA,ture under the provisions of the,21
NA,Grapes Charges Act and is paid to the,21
NA,"board for administrative expenditure,",21
NA,research and overseas publicity.,21
NA,"board, with the support of the Federal",21
NA,"Viticultural Council, has now sought",21
NA,amending legislation to increase the,21
NA,maximum rates of levy to be collected,21
NA,under the Wine Grapes Charges Act.,21
NA,W i th such additional funds the board,21
NA,would be i n a position to carry out,21
NA,ORDERS. intensive marketing publicity i n Austra-,21
NA,"lia and overseas. However, i t is first",21
NA,necessary to amend the Wine Overseas,21
NA,Marketing Act to place beyond doubt the,21
NA,constitutional power of the board to,21
NA,conduct publicity activities within Aus-,21
NA,tralia.,21
NA,There is no doubt that a properly,21
NA,co-ordinated publicity drive in Australia,21
NA,and overseas would help the wine,21
NA,industry. Sales i n Australia have con-,21
NA,tracted i n recent years and efforts to,21
NA,expand the overseas trade have been,21
NA,severely handicapped by the high United,21
NA,"Kingdom tariff on wine, and by other",21
NA,"factors. A t the same time, production",21
NA,has been steadily increasing. Stocks of,21
NA,Austvalian wines held here and i n the,21
NA,BILL 1954. United Kingdom have reached a very,21
NA,high level and i t is clear that a heavy,21
NA,for an vintage next year could create a very real,21
NA,Act. storage problem. Prices of wine grapes,21
NA,"fell sharply i n the last two seasons, and",21
NA,this led to requests for Australian,21
NA,Government intervention and assistance.,21
NA,The industry believes that expansion of,21
NA,sales can be achieved by a national pub-,21
NA,licity campaign to supplement brand,21
NA,advertising by individual winemakers.,21
NA,The amendment of the act proposed i n,21
NA,this bill w i l l authorize the board to use,21

NA,Tliat the bill be now read a second time.,22
NA,The purpose of this bill is to amend the,22
NA,Wine Grapes Charges Act 1929-1941 to,22
NA,authorize an increase in the maximum,22
NA,rates of levy that may be collected on,22
NA,grapes delivered to wineries and distil-,22

NA,now provides for tbe collection from wine-,22
NA,makers and distillers of levies up to a,22
NA,maximum of 5s. a ton in respect of fresh,22
NA,grapes and 15s. a ton in respect of dried,22
NA,"grapes. The actual rates, within those",22
NA,"maximum levels, are prescribed by regula-",22
NA,tion. The present prescribed rates are,22
NA,4s. and 12s. a ton respectively. The,22
NA,funds derived from those levies are used,22
NA,by the Australian Wine Board for ad-,22
NA,"ministrative expenditure, overseas adver-",22

NA,raise the existing maximum rates from,22
NA,5s. to 10s. a tou in respect of,22

NA,the rate of levy chargeable on meat ex-,22
NA,ported from Australia in pursuance of the,22
NA,provisions of the Meat Export Charges,22
NA,"Act 1935. Until May, 1947, export levies",22
NA,were collected under the authority of that,22
NA,"act, paid into Consolidated Eevenue,",22
NA,appropriated out of revenue and paid to,22
NA,the Australian Meat Board. The board,22
NA,financed its activities from the funds so,22
NA,obtained. The Australian Meat Board,22
NA,"was reconstituted in 1946, when it was",22
NA,given added powers to act as a buyer and,22
NA,seller of meat on .behalf of the Common-,22
NA,wealth for the purpose of carrying out,22
NA,the Commonwealth's obligations under,22
NA,the bulk meat contracts with the United,22

NA,more appropriate for the board to finance,22
NA,its activities by withholding from its sup-,22
NA,pliers a small percentage of the United,22

NA,unanimously that the'levy under the Meat,23

NA,the maximum rate >of levy be .increased.,23
NA,The board has stated that 'the maximum,23
NA,rates of charge prescribed by the 1'935,23
NA,"act would be ""much too low to finance the",23
NA,operating costs of the board nmder present,23
NA,"conditions. As the act now stands, the",23
NA,"maximum charge permitted on heef, for",23

NA,"quarter, or about 1/8Od. per lb. The",23

NA,"ministrative expenses. However, the",23
NA,return to private trading and the cessa-,23
NA,tion of rationing and distribution controls,23
NA,in .the United Kingdom have placed,23
NA,"emphasis on the need to publicize meat,",23
NA,".particularly Australian meat, in our over-",23

NA,"o'f about £31,000 from two years' trading.",23

NA,I t is emphasized that these funds are,23

NA,the holders of certain Crown leases of land,24
NA,in the Northern Territory of Australia.,24
NA,"Bill presented, and read a first time.",24
NA,SECOND READING.,24
Mr HASLUCK ,Curtin-Minister for,24
NA,Territories) [3.38] - I move-,24
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,24
NA,The purpose of this bill is to make it,24
NA,-easier for the resident pastoralist in the,24
NA,Northern Territory to obtain credit for,24
NA,the development of his property. The bill,24
NA,marks another stage in the actions which,24
NA,the Government has been taking both to,24
NA,build up the pastoral industry in the,24
NA,Northern Territory and to bring about the,24
NA,desirable social effect of ensuring that,24
NA,the development of the resources of the,24
NA,Territory is accompanied by an increase,24
NA,in the number of permanent residents,24
NA,establishing their homes and their families,24
NA,in the Territory.,24
NA,One of the earliest steps which the Go-,24
NA,vernment took in that direction was to,24
NA,amend the land tenure system in the,24
NA,Northern Territory so as to give a more,24
NA,favorable tenure to the resident owner.,24
NA,"We are hoping that, as a result of th«i",24
NA,passage of the Crown Lands Ordinance,24
NA,"of the Northern Territory, pastoralists",24
NA,will convert their leaseholds to the form of,24
NA,perpetual leasehold known as the pastoral,24
NA,homestead lease. We are also hoping,24
NA,"that, as more land becomes available for",24
NA,"application in the Northern Territory, we",24
NA,may be able to attract to the Territory,24
NA,".young, energetic and practical people who",24
NA,will -make the Territory their home. I n,24
NA,"order to promote that objective, we not",24
NA,only have to make the land available but,24
NA,"we also should try to see that those ""who",24
NA,obtain the pastoral homestead leaseholds,24
NA,will have the capital resources necessary,24
NA,to develop them.,24
NA,A cattle station in the Northern Terri-,24
NA,tory -requires a large capital expenditure,24
NA,spread over a number of years in order to,24
NA,bring -it -into a full state of economic,24
NA,development. There may be differences of,24
NA,opinion as to the amount of capitalization,24
NA,which it is economic for a pastoral pro-,24
NA,"perty to bear, and the figure varies con-",24
NA,siderably from property to property,24
NA,according to such factors as the type of,24
NA,"country, access to markets, the type of",24
NA,"cattle which can be turned on, and the",24
NA,price likely to be received. As a broad,24
NA,indication to the House of the sort of,24
NA,"expenditure that is involved, I may men-",24
NA,tion that some cattle stations of moderate,24
NA,size in tbe Northern Territory carry a,24
NA,"capital expenditure, spread over a num-",24
NA,"ber of years, up to £120,000. Expendi-",24
NA,ture is required on the provision of,24
NA,"waters at a cost of possibly £4,000 each,",24
NA,some miles of fencing at a cost up to,24
NA,"£400 a mile, homestead, staff quarters and",24
NA,other station buildings at a bare mini-,24
NA,"mum cost of £15,000, and the building",24
NA,"-of yards and dips, quite apart from expen-",24
NA,diture on the herd.,24
NA,"Broadly speaking, there is not a great",24
NA,number of young settlers who have that,24
NA,kind of capital at their disposal. I n,24
NA,many cases their assets are their know-,24
NA,"ledge, their physical stamina and their",24
NA,"pioneering spirit, plus enough capital to",24
NA,acquire a herd of a few thousand head,24
NA,and to give them their first dwelling. I f,24
NA,"they go on to new land, the Government",24
NA,provides the first two Waters for them so,24
NA,that they can move their cattle on to the,24
NA,run straight away. Most of those who,24
NA,"go on to properties, either new or de-",24
NA,"veloped, find themselves limited in the",24
NA,early developmental period by the need,24
NA,for more capital. To some extent they,24
NA,can obtain finance through the existing,24
NA,"institutions, but their leaseholds are sel-",24
NA,dom accepted as security for ah amount,24
NA,"sufficient, in the early stages of develop-",24
NA,"ment, to make progress possible and, if",24
NA,"they give a lien over their stock, the terms",24
NA,are seldom sufficient to do more than meet,25
NA,their running expenses as an offset to,25
NA,their anticipated sales in each year.,25
NA,"I n any land development, while the need",25
NA,"for capital is clear, i t is also necessary to",25
NA,watch carefully against two unintended,25
NA,results that could impair the final good,25
NA,result. One is the possibility of over-,25
NA,"capitalization, or the spending of more on",25
NA,the land than the prospective returns from,25
NA,the land would justify. I t is necessary to,25
NA,ensure that .expenditure on a property,25
NA,will give an economic return. The other,25
NA,"is the possibility that, if credit is too easily",25
NA,"obtainable, there will be an inflation of",25
NA,"land values, which will also tend, over the",25
NA,"years, to impede the economic use of the",25
NA,"land. Thus, the administrative problem",25
NA,before the Government is to make credit,25
NA,available for the development of lease-,25
NA,"holds, and, at the same time, to see that",25
NA,the availability of credit is closely related,25
NA,to all other factors. After careful con-,25
NA,"sideration, tbe Government also decided",25
NA,that tbe existing financial institutions,25
NA,"should be used, that i t was neither neces-",25
NA,sary nor desirable to establish any new-,25
NA,governmental instrumentality to achieve,25
NA,its purpose or to serve the needs of the,25
NA,prospective beneficiaries under the scheme,25
NA,"in the Northern Territory. The bill,",25
NA,"therefore, proposes to add to the credit",25
NA,facilities available to settlers of the,25
NA,Northern Territory by providing a,25
NA,guarantee to 'the bank's for advances,25
NA,additional to those which banks might,25
NA,be expected to make in the ordinary,25
NA,course of business and in the absence of,25
NA,a guarantee from the Commonwealth,25
NA,Treasury. I n the definitions clause of the,25
NA,bill it is made clear that all banks doing,25
NA,this class of business can assist in the,25
NA,scheme. The upper limit of advances,25
NA,will be the value of leases plus permanent,25
NA,"improvements, or a total of £30,000,",25
NA,"whichever is the lesser. I n effect, tbis",25
NA,means that a lease-holder will be able to,25
NA,"obtain credit up to 100 per cent, of the",25
NA,"value of his security, exclusive of his",25
NA,"herd, subject to the provision that his",25
NA,"total advance, at any time, shall not",25
NA,"exceed £30,000. I n the absence of a",25
NA,"guarantee, the banks customarily grant",25
NA,"credit only up to about 60 per cent, of the",25
NA,value of the security.,25
NA,The best way for me to illustrate to the,25
NA,House how the scheme will operate is to,25
NA,Mr Hasluck.,25
NA,take three examples from successive stages,25
NA,in the development of leaseholds. I f a,25
NA,lease were in a relatively early stage of,25
NA,"development, and the land and permanent",25
NA,"improvements were valued at £20,000, a",25
NA,"bank might be expected, in the normal",25
NA,"course of business, to advance £12,000.",25
NA,The Treasury will guarantee a further,25
NA,"advance of £8,000, making available to",25
NA,"the lease-holder a total credit of £20,000.",25
NA,I f the lease had been developed to a,25
NA,stage where the land plus permanent,25
NA,"improvements were valued at £30,000, the",25
NA,bank might be expected to advance,25
NA,"£18,000. The Treasury will guarantee",25
NA,"a further advance of £12,000, making a",25
NA,"total credit of £30,000 available to the",25
NA,lease-holder for developmental purposes.,25
NA,I f the lease had reached a stage of,25
NA,development where the land plus per-,25
NA,manent improvements were valued at.,25
NA,"£60,000, a bank might, in the normal",25
NA,"course of business, be expected to advance,",25
NA,"without guarantee, up to £36,000, i f its",25
NA,omcers were convinced that the property,25
NA,warranted such further expenditure.,25
NA,From these examples honorable mem-,25
NA,bers will see that the aim of the,25
NA,bill is that the Treasury shall back,25
NA,settlers until they can stand on,25
NA,their own financial feet and that the,25
NA,normal methods of obtaining credit will,25
NA,then be followed.,25
NA,The bill provides that guaranteed,25
NA,advances may be made for the,25
NA,purpose of effecting permanent im-,25
NA,provements to land the subject of,25
NA,"leases, or partly for that purpose",25
NA,and partly for the purpose of discharging,25
NA,prior encumbrances in order to enable,25
NA,new first mortgages to be given as,25
NA,"security. I n other words, the bill will",25
NA,help a lease-holder so to improve his posi-,25
NA,tion as to be able to obtain credit in the,25
NA,normal way. I t should induce a consider-,25
NA,able increase of the amount of credit,25
NA,available in the Northern Territory. The,25
NA,increase will be probably far greater,25
NA,than the amount actually guaranteed by,25
NA,the Commonwealth. The granting of,25
NA,advances to pastoralists for purposes,25
NA,mentioned in the bill should be-,25
NA,come more attractive to the banks,25
NA,"than' in the past. Therefore, the measure",25
NA,-,25
NA,should stimulate their interest in the,25
NA,development of the Northern Territory,25
NA,and reduce the conservatism that they,26
NA,have previously evinced in the making,26
NA,of advances to settlers. I t is confidently,26
NA,expected that the bill will be instru-,26
NA,mental in bringing about a considerable,26
NA,improvement of the standard of pastoral,26
NA,properties. By this measure the Govern-,26
NA,ment is demonstrating its confidence in,26
NA,the future of the Northern Territory.,26
NA,I t is hoped that this will stimulate the,26
NA,interest of business institutions in that,26
NA,development. The Government has had,26
NA,no direct experience of this kind of assistready,26
NA,a n t to settlers in the Northern Terri-,26
NA,"tory, and consequently we shall watch",26
NA,very closely the application of the provi-,26
NA,"sions of the bill. I f necessary, in future,",26
NA,"other steps will"" be taken to help to ensure export.",26
NA,that the measures are adequate to achieve,26
NA,the result desired. The scheme can be,26
NA,adjusted to meet new needs or new oppor-,26
NA,tunities. At the same time it must,26
NA,be watched closely. Although we want to,26
NA,"encourage development, we do not want",26
NA,to reach that stage of careless expenditure,26
NA,and financial light-heartedness as a pre-,26
NA,lude to financial misery which charac-,26
NA,terized some of the earlier scheme of,26
NA,assisted settlement in Australia.,26
NA,The conditions that I have mentioned,26
NA,in relation to pastoral homestead leases,26
NA,"will apply, also, to agricultural leases in",26
NA,the Northern Territory. The limits to,26
NA,agriculture in the Territory are deter-,26
NA,mined not only by the fact that most of,26
NA,"the land is in a low rainfall area, but",26
NA,"that, in the areas of relatively higher",26
NA,"rainfall, normally regarded as most suit-",26
NA,"able for agriculture, there is every year a",26
NA,rainless period of seven or eight months.,26
NA,Only a few rivers in the Northern Terri-,26
NA,tory carry enough water to enable the,26
NA,"establishment of irrigation schemes,",26
NA,within the conventional meaning of the,26
NA,"term. I n view of this seasonal situation,",26
NA,our problem is to find the crops that can,26
NA,be raised profitably in the Northern,26
NA,Territory. During the last three years,26
NA,"much new work-totall y new, as far as",26
NA,the Territory is concerned-ha s been,26
NA,carried out under the direction of the,26
NA,"Administrator, Mr ""Wise, in experiment-",26
NA,ing with various crops under field condi-,26
NA,"tions. For a number of years, also, the",26
NA,Administration and tbe Commonwealth,26
NA,Scientific and Industrial Besearch,26
NA,Organization have co-operated in various,26
NA,experiments and trials at the Katherine,26
NA,"experiment farm. More recently, we",26
NA,have begun investigations into water,26
NA,"supplies, the best way of using the avail-",26
NA,"able water, and the problem of water con-",26
NA,trol in the higher rainfall areas near,26
NA,Darwin. Those studies are continuing.,26
NA,With the help of the Commonwealth,26
NA,Scientific and Industrial Besearch,26
NA,"Organization, extensive soil surveys have",26
NA,been carried out. Most of the soils with,26
NA,possible agricultural value have been al-,26
NA,"mapped, with a good deal of exact-",26
NA,"ness. I n addition, a few pioneer settlers",26
NA,have embarked on the production of food-,26
NA,"stuffs for local consumption and, to a",26
NA,"limited extent, bananas and peanuts for",26
NA,The credit facilities provided by the bill,26
NA,will be available not only to the existing,26
NA,"farmers in the Northern Territory, but",26
NA,"also to persons who, as a result of the",26
NA,experimental work that is being carried,26
NA,"out by the Government, may be en-",26
NA,couraged to enter the agricultural,26
NA,industry in the Territory.,26
NA,"I n passing, although it is not related to",26
NA,"this bill, I might point out tbat, for some",26
NA,"time, a scheme of advances to primary pro-",26
NA,ducers-mostl y small men growing fresh,26
NA,foodstuffs in the vicinity of Darwin-ha s,26
NA,been administered locally by a primary,26
NA,"producers' board. Hitherto, the limit of",26
NA,advances by the board has been £600 to,26
NA,also each settler. The Government has decided,26
NA,"to raise that Hmit to £3,000. The purpose",26
NA,of the scheme administered by the board,26
NA,is mainly to assist small producers to,26
NA,obtain implements and equipment. That,26
NA,scheme is quite different from the scheme,26
NA,envisaged in the bill and was created to,26
NA,serve a different purpose.,26
NA,I n order that tbe propsals in this,26
NA,bill may be seen in relation to the,26
NA,background it might interest the,26
NA,"House I f I were to indicate, broadly the",26
NA,present scope of the pastoral and agri-,26
NA,cultural industries in the Northern Terri-,26
NA,tory. They are far more extensive than is,26
NA,generally recognized by persons living in,26
NA,the southern States. Cattle are produced,26
NA,on 407 pastoral leases having a total area,26
NA,"of 215,355 square miles. Not acres, mind",26
NA,"you, but square miles. At first scrutiny,",26
NA,approximately 318 of those leases would,26
NA,appear to be held in a way that might,26
NA,"qualify, them for' conversion to pastoral,",27
NA,"homestead leases; with perpetual tenure;,",27
NA,aud about. 89 held by companies would!,27

NA,50-year tenure. Definite improvement,27
NA,conditions w i ll be written into all. new,27
NA,leases granted under the. Crown Land,27
NA,Ordinances. I t is expected that some,27
NA,lease-holders may surrender areas on,27
NA,which they expect thait. they will be,27
NA,unable to maintain the required level,27
NA,of improvements. As an example of the,27
NA,way the policy will be applied,27
NA,"in the Northern Territory, I refer honor-",27
NA,ablemembers to the statement that 1,27
NA,"made in the House on the 7th April, when",27
NA,"I pointed out that Vestey's, in negotiating",27
NA,"new leases under the new ordinances, had",27
NA,"surrendered 8,493 square miles of lease-",27
NA,"hold,, and 5,351 square miles held under",27
NA,grazing licence and had accepted improve-,27
NA,ment conditions on their remaining leases,27
NA,in tlie form of firm obligations with,27
NA,specific requirements that they make an,27
NA,"expenditure of £250,000 during the next",27
NA,fi ve years.,27
NA,On all the Territory holdings there is,27
NA,a cattle population of a little over,27
NA,"1,000,000 head and an average annual",27
NA,"turn-off of 115,000 head, some going",27
NA,straight to the meatworks and some going,27
NA,"as stores, mainly to Queensland. The",27
NA,estimated annual value is about,27
NA,"£2y720,000. I n spite of a most severe and",27
NA,widespread drought in 1951-52 and some,27
NA,rather indifferent seasons since in some,27
NA,"parts of the Territory, tbe cattle industry",27
NA,is progressing. The approximate turn-off,27
NA,over the past seven years has totalled,27
NA,"800,000 head and the annual turn-off has",27
NA,"varied, between 146,000 in a good yeai*",27
NA,"and S1,000 in a bad, the turn-off",27
NA,necessarily fluctuating according to,27
NA,seasonal conditions. I t is estimated that,27
NA,in the past four years there has been a.,27
NA,private investment in improvements on,27
NA,cattle stations in the Northern Territory,27
NA,"of more than £1,000,000- a heartening",27
NA,sign of the confidence of cattlemen in,27
NA,the future of the country tliey occupy.,27
NA,The Government's own officers estimate,27
NA,"that the potential for development, of the",27
NA,industry is an increase of about 50 per,27
NA,"cent, in the carrying capacity of land",27
NA,already occupied and a doubling of the,27
NA,annual turn-off. We believe that that,27
NA,Mr Basluoh.,27
NA,improvement cantake place without any.,27
NA,revolutionary change in the traditional;,27
NA,methods of raisingcattle in the Terri-,27
NA,"tory. I f , by one means or another,",27
NA,"through the aid of science, completely",27
NA,different methods were to be developed-,27
NA,"in the Northern Territory, the change",27
NA,may be even greater.,27
NA,The present state of agricul-,27
NA,ture is that production of food-,27
NA,"stuffs, such as vegetables and eggs, i.;",27
NA,"undertaken on a small scale, for local con-",27
NA,"sumption, and, as I have said , some fruit",27
NA,:,27
NA,and peanut production is undertaken for,27
NA,"export to southern Australian, markets.",27
NA,The potential development that is in,27
NA,"sight is large-scale rice-growing, a con-",27
NA,siderable expansion of peanut cultiva-,27
NA,tion ancl establishment of tobacco-growing.,27
NA,These look like being our main export,27
NA,possibilities. I t also includes the estab-,27
NA,lishment of mixed farming for the sake,27
NA,of local food supply and as an adjunct,27
NA,"to stock raising. However, continued'",27
NA,experimentation is necessary to demon-,27
NA,strate with reasonable certainty farm sys-,27
NA,tems which can be applied to the land,27
NA,with reasonable prospects of providing »,27
NA,satisfactory living for the farmers.,27
NA,".hi conclusion, I stress that the only way",27
NA,in which any of our visions of progress in,27
NA,the north can be realized-an d I think,27
NA,most honorable members have a vision of,27
NA,progress there-i s through the efforts of,27
NA,individual settlers. The end of govern-,27
NA,"ment policy, as exemplified by this bill",27
NA,"and by other measures, is to help tbe",27
NA,individual Australian i n the Northern,27
NA,Torritory to do his job for the nation in,27
NA,the Northern Territory. That is the,27
NA,purpose of the attempts we have made,27
NA,and will continue to make to improve the,27
NA,"basic services of education, health and",27
NA,communications and to add to the,27
NA,"amenities of life, so that people can live",27
NA,at a proper standard i n the Territory.,27
NA,That is also the purpose of the. various,27
NA,investigations and experiments we are,27
NA,"carrying, out into tbe ways in whicb",27
NA,"people can earn a living, in tie Territory.",27
NA,That is the purpose of our revision of,27
NA,the land laws. I t is tlie purpose behind,27
NA,the increased provision we have made to,27
NA,"assist various industries, for example, by",27
NA,"the veterinary services, the stock routes",27
NA,and roads which are being provided f o r,27
NA,the pastoral industry. I t is the purpose,28
NA,behind our attempts to encourage a new,28
NA,idea of the standard of living in the,28
NA,"tropics, as exemplified by the housing",28
NA,and community services constructed by,28
NA,Territory Enterprises at Batchelor. I t,28
NA,is to the purpose of a relatively small,28
NA,measure sueh as the present bill. Some,28
NA,people believe that settlers who go to,28
NA,live in the Northern Territory ought to,28
NA,live in humpies. Those days are past.,28
NA,"The nation, has to accept the idea that the",28
NA,people in the Northern. Territory are to,28
NA,live in good homes at a standard of living,28
NA,comparable with the best standards,28
NA,enjoyed by people anywhere in Australia.,28
NA,We hope that this bill will make it more,28
NA,easily possible for the residents of the,28
NA,Territory to develop the land that they,28
NA,"can obtain, and make their contribution",28
NA,to the progress of the Territory. We,28
NA,"believe that the Northern Territory, like",28
NA,"any other part of Australia, will grow by",28
NA,tha efforts o'f its people. Tbe role of,28
NA,"government, in the liberal view, is to help",28
NA,the people to get on with the job. I trust,28
NA,that this bill will serve that purpose in,28
NA,the pastoral and agricultural industries,28
NA,"in the Northern Territory and, in thar,",28
NA,"faith, commend it to tbe House.",28

NA,BILL 1954.,28
NA,Motion (by Mr HASLUCK) agreed to-,28
NA,That leave be given to bring in a ibill for,28
NA,aet to amend the Papua and New Guinea Act,28
NA,1'949-1950.,28
NA,"Bill presented', and road a first time.",28
NA,SECOND BBADINO.,28
Mr HASLUCK ,Ourtin-Ministe r for,28
NA,Territories) [4.2] - I move-,28
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,28
NA,Under this bill i t is proposed to make,28
NA,several small amendments to the Papua,28
NA,"and New Guinea Act, which was passed",28
NA,by this Parliament in 1949 to provide for,28
NA,theadministration of the Territory of,28
NA,Papua and the Territory of New Guinea,28
NA,in an administrative union. Only two of,28
NA,tho amendments involve'decisions on any,28
NA,matter of substance. I t is proposed to,28
NA,amend section 73 of the principal act i n,28
NA,order to make it clear that the'prerogative,28
NA,of mercy is exercised by the Governor-,28
NA,"General. Section 73, as it stands, confers",28
NA,on the Administrator of the Territory,28
NA,power to grant to any offender convicted,28
NA,by a court exercising criminal jurisdic-,28
NA,"tion in the Territory, a pardon, either",28
NA,"free or conditional, or a remission or",28
NA,"commutation of sentence, or a respite for",28
NA,"such period as he thinks fit, of the execu-",28
NA,tion of sentence. The Government con-,28
NA,"siders, and I am sure the House will agree,",28
NA,that it is inappropriate for an oflicial to,28
NA,be required to exercise such powers in,28
NA,regard to a sentence of death. A sen-,28
NA,tence of death is clearly in a wholly,28
NA,different category from a sentence of,28
NA,"imprisonment and, whereas we see no",28
NA,"objection to the Administrator, who is a",28
NA,"government official, continuing to have",28
NA,the authority to remit or commute sen-,28
NA,"tences that involve lesser penalties, we do",28
NA,not think the prerogative of mercy should,28
NA,be exercised except at the very highest,28
NA,levels of government. Some time ago an,28
NA,instruction to that effect was given to,28
NA,the Administrator by the Government and,28
NA,"this bill, giving effect to administrative",28
NA,"practice over the past three years, will",28
NA,exclude death sentences from the section,28
NA,dealing with the Administrator's powers,28
NA,and will insert a new sub-section as,28
NA,follows:-,28
NA,"The Governor-General may, by warrant",28
NA,"under his hand, grant to an offender sentenced",28
NA,to death by a court exercising criminal juris-,28
NA,"diction in the Territory a pardon, either free or",28
NA,"an conditional,, or a remission or commutation-",28
NA,"of sentence, or a respite for such period as he",28
NA,"thinks fit, of the execution of sentence.",28
NA,"I f any death sentence, is passed in Papua",28
NA,and New Guinea the procedure will be to,28
NA,"refer it to Canberra, where the Governor-",28
NA,General acting in Executive Council will,28
NA,decide whether or not i t is to be carried,28
NA,"out. I may mention, i n passing that this",28
NA,"proposed amendment, does not arise out",28
NA,"of, or have any direct relation to, any",28
NA,recent events in the Territory. The,28
NA,"decision was made early last year and,, i n",28
NA,"fact, the present bill has been in draft",28
NA,"form for many months. I t will, of",28
NA,"course, be applicable, to any death,",28
NA,"sentences recently passed in the Territory,",28
NA,but the idea of presenting this bill to the,28
NA,House did not arise out of any recent,28
NA,incident in the Territory.,28
Mr DUTHIE ,Wa s it touched up,29
NA,afterwards ?,29
Mr HASLUCK ,No . No change,29
NA,has been made. The bill reads as i t was,29
NA,drafted twelve months ago.,29
NA,The other substantial decision to which,29
NA,"effect is given in this bill, is to change",29
NA,the title of Chief Judge of the Supreme,29
NA,Court of the Territory to Chief Justice.,29
NA,This is in keeping with the usage in the,29
NA,supreme courts of the States of Australia.,29
NA,The change in title is accompanied by,29
NA,a provision to appoint the present Chief,29
NA,"Judge, Mr Justice Phillips, as Chief",29
NA,Justice with continuity of office.,29
NA,As it was necessary to introduce an,29
NA,amending bill to make the changes,29
NA,"mentioned above, advantage was taken",29
NA,of the opportunity to make other minor,29
NA,changes the need for which had become,29
NA,apparent in the working of the principal,29
NA,act. A l l references to native village,29
NA,councils in the principal act will be,29
NA,"replaced by the words ""native local",29
NA,"government councils"", because, in prac-",29
NA,"tice, the majority of councils established",29
NA,have not been set up in relation to indi-,29
NA,vidual villages but have been formed to,29
NA,represent several groups of villages. No,29
NA,change will be made in respect of the,29
NA,nature and functions of these councils.,29
NA,An amendment is proposed to clause,29
NA,10 to enable an official member of the,29
NA,Legislative Council to resign his seat.,29
NA,Previously i f an official member wished,29
NA,to resign for any reason whatsoever there,29
NA,was no legal provision by which he could,29
NA,"do so. The resignation will not, however,",29
NA,become effective unless and until accepted,29
NA,"by the Governor-General, by whom the",29
NA,appointment of official members is made,29
NA,and subject to whose pleasure such,29
NA,appointments are held. A further amend-,29
NA,ment will also make i t clear that resignalonger,29
NA,tion by a non-official member becomes,29
NA,effective when it is received by the,29
NA,Administrator. These proposed amend-,29
NA,ments are similar to amendments made,29
NA,during 1953 to the Northern Territory,29
NA,.(Administration) Act.,29
NA,Section 52 of the Papua and New,29
NA,Guinea Act requires that certain,29
NA,ordinances of the Legislative Council,29
NA,Papua and New Guinea shall be reserved,29
NA,"for the Governor-General's pleasure,",29
NA,the Governor-General has power only.to,29
NA,s BiU 1954.,29
NA,assent or withhold assent to the ordinance,29
NA,in its entirety. Instances have occurred,29
NA,where it would have been of advantage,29
NA,for the Governor-General to be able tc,29
NA,"withhold assent to part, only, of an",29
NA,ordinance. I n the absence of such,29
NA,"power, it has been necessary for assent to",29
NA,the whole of an ordinance to be withheld,29
NA,when part only of it was not acceptable.,29
NA,Clause 11 of the bill proposes an amend-,29
NA,ment which will enable the Governor-,29
NA,General to assent either to the whole or,29
NA,part of an ordinance reserved for his,29
NA,pleasure. The new section departs from,29
NA,the existing section by providing that the,29
NA,Governor-General's declaration as to,29
NA,"assent or otherwise, and not the Gazette",29
NA,"notification, must take place within one",29
NA,"year and also that, i f the Governor-",29
NA,"General's assent is not to be given, lie",29
NA,shall expressly declare that he withholds,29
NA,assent. The first departure is intended,29
NA,to avoid the difficulties that could arise,29
NA,as to pnblication within twelve months,29
NA,if assent were not given until near the,29
NA,end of the expiration of that period. The,29
NA,second departure is to enable the Gover-,29
NA,nor-General to declare forthwith that he,29
NA,withholds assent to an Ordinance and,29
NA,thus avoid the uncertainty as to his,29
NA,intention that would otherwise exist until,29
NA,the period of one year has elapsed.,29
NA,Consequent on the inauguration of the,29
NA,Legislative Council for Papua and New,29
NA,Guinea it was clear that that part of the,29
NA,principal act relating to the interim legis-,29
NA,lative powers of the Governor-General,29
NA,was unnecessary. I t is now possible to,29
NA,repeal the whole of the division of the,29
NA,act relating to the interim legislative,29
NA,powers of the Governor-General. As,29
NA,laws are now made by the Legislative,29
NA,"Council, the need for these provisions no",29
NA,exists. Appropriate provision is,29
NA,contained in the bill to ensure the con-,29
NA,tinuance in force of all ordinances made,29
NA,by the Governor-General during such,29
NA,interim period which still remain in,29
NA,"force, as well as to provide enabling",29
NA,power for the Legislative Council to,29
NA,amend or repeal such ordinances as the,29
NA,necessity may arise from time to time.,29
NA,for I repeat tbat only two decisions on,29
NA,matters of substance are involved in this,29
NA,but bill. Tbe other amendments may,29
NA,properly be described as tidying-up,29
NA,"amendments, designed to make the present",30
NA,act clearer and more easily workable.,30

Mr CURTIN ,Watson) [4.12] -,30
NA,Wben tbis debate was adjourned I was,30
NA,pressing the Government to pay some,30
NA,attention to the very controversial subject,30
NA,of margins for skill. The trade union,30
NA,movement has made up its mind that,30
NA,what was tolerable during the imme-,30
NA,diate post-war period is no longer,30
NA,tolerable. The long-suffering trades-,30
NA,men are becoming uneasy at the pro-,30
NA,crastination of the gentlemen of the,30
NA,Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I f,30
NA,the Government does not take action,30
NA,"quickly in relation to margins for skill,",30
NA,very grave industrial unrest will occur,30
NA,and the blame will be laid at the door,30
NA,of this incompetent Government - The,30
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) has indi-,30
NA,cated that the Government will under-,30
NA,take large defence expenditure. This,30
NA,expenditure will require much technical,30
NA,equipment and we shall need more techni-,30
NA,cians to operate that equipment. Where,30
NA,does the Prime Minister think that he,30
NA,will get tbe technicians to do essential,30
NA,work in connexion with the defence pro-,30
NA,gramme? The Government has negated,30
NA,all claims for simple justice by skilled,30
NA,workers. I t bas killed the incentive that,30
NA,the average lad needs to induce him to,30
NA,embark on a career as a skilled tradesman.,30
NA,The Government should give deep con-,30
NA,sideration to this subject when it is con-,30
NA,sidering its defence programme. We must,30
NA,not forget the position in which we were,30
NA,left when war broke out in 1939. A l l,30
NA,sorts of committees had to be set up in,30
NA,order to find men with varying degrees,30
NA,of skill to carry on tbe work that was,30
NA,"necessary at that time. Recently, the",30
NA,secretary of the Brisbane branch of the,30
NA,Boilermakers TJnion made the following,30
NA,statement in court:-,30
NA,Two hundred boilermakers are needed in,30
NA,Queensland . . . We have had appeals,30
NA,from the Eailways Department and private,30
NA,industry to recruit staff for them. I n one,30
NA,"instance alone, a private employer in Brisbane",30
NA,could place more than 100 boilermakers. One,30
NA,of the prime factors in the shortage was lack,30
NA,of inducement for lads to enter the trade as,30
NA,apprentices.,30
NA,The shortage had caused a considerable,30
NA,amount of overtime work and to protect the,30
NA,"health of members, the society had limited",30
NA,overtime to twelve hours a week.,30
NA,That assertion was replied to by the secre-,30
NA,tary of the Queensland Employers' Fed-,30
NA,NA,30
NA,said-,30
NA,There is no trut h in thc suggestion that,30
NA,boilermakers were scarce because of a lack of,30
NA,inducement to youths to enter the trade . . .,30
NA,He added-,30
NA,I u dealings with 'unions our experience has,30
NA,been that youths and men w i l l avoid a trade,30
NA,where union leaders regularly call stoppages,30
NA,and strikes.,30
NA,Such a statement shows that this,30
NA,gentleman is unfit to hold the posi-,30
NA,tion that he occupies. Apprentices,30
NA,"are not allowed to strike, and unions place",30
NA,severe restrictions on apprentices in that,30
NA,regard. Mr Self continued-,30
NA,"Instead, they prefer continuity of work in",30
NA,a trade which is not upset by union leaders.,30
NA,"All trade unions have leaders, and the",30
NA,people who employ Mr Self to give his,30
NA,opinions in regard to incentives sbould,30
NA,seriously consider removing him from his,30
NA,position because his statements are very,30
NA,provocative indeed. The Minister for,30
NA,"Labour and National Service ( Mr Holt),",30
NA,in a speech that he delivered on the 29th,30
NA,"June about margins for skill, said that",30
NA,the Government would support claims for,30
NA,"higher margins for really skilled men, as",30
NA,long as they were not submerged in a,30
NA,general claim for higher margins for all,30
NA,"workers. Of course, he was just creating",30
NA,a smoke-screen in order to set up some,30
NA,sort of caste system among skilled workers.,30
NA,I f the Minister had taken sufficient trouble,30
NA,to analyse the quality of the skills pos-,30
NA,"sessed by many workers, he would not",30
NA,have made a statement such as that. For,30
NA,"example, no one can doubt tbat a rigger",31
NA,is a highly skilled man. A man needs to,31
NA,have fifteen or twenty years' experience,31
NA,before he can become a fully qualified,31
NA,rigger. The shearer has to use his know-,31
NA,ledge and skill as well as have excellent,31
NA,"physical development. The timber-getter,",31
NA,"besides being a skilled man, has to take",31
NA,great risks in his occupation. The builder's,31
NA,labourer is a most essential member of,31
NA,"the community. The brickmaker, the",31
NA,"ironworker, the wharflabourer and the",31
NA,"tilemaker are all skilled workmen, and",31
NA,yet the Minister for Labour and National,31
NA,Service apparently does not recognize their,31
NA,skill. I suggest that statements such as,31
NA,that made by the Minister merely pro-,31
NA,voke our trade unions into action.,31
NA,Margins for skill bave not increased since,31
NA,"1945, and skilled workmen are now deter-",31
NA,mined to be heard. I f the Justices of the,31
NA,Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and,31
NA,"Arbitration, and the Government, will not.",31
NA,"listen to them, they will take some action",31
NA,which will not be to the advantage of this,31
NA,Government or the community in general.,31
NA,Mr TUHNBDLI. -Wha t action?,31
Mr CURTIN ,Le t us be realistic,31
NA,about it. They will threaten to strike,31
NA,"and withhold their labour, just as pri-",31
NA,mary producers among the members of,31
NA,the Australian Country party withhold,31
NA,their products from the markets. The,31
NA,Australian Country party has claimed,31
NA,that the farmer is justified in withholding,31
NA,"his produce when he pleases, and there-",31
NA,fore it must admit that highly skilled,31
NA,workmen are justified in withholding,31
NA,their labour in certain circumstances. Such,31
NA,"men, especially those in defence produc-",31
NA,"tion industries, should be looked after by",31
NA,"this Government, which should intervene",31
NA,before the court when they make applica-,31
NA,tions for increased margins for skill.,31
NA,"Shipwrights, engineers, boilermakers and",31
NA,moulders are not going to be trifled with,31
NA,any longer. They intend to ensure that,31
NA,they shall get a just reward for their,31
NA,"skill. Indeed, the Australian Council of",31
NA,Trades Unions has now decided upon a,31
NA,certain policy whicb has been endorsed by,31
NA,the Federal Conference of the Australian,31
NA,Labour party. I am speaking on behalf,31
NA,of the Australian Council of Trades,31
NA,Unions when I claim that this very im-,31
NA,portant matter cannot be trifled with any,31
NA,"longer. I f the Government, thinks that",31
NA,1,31
NA,it can continue to so trifle with skilled,31
NA,"men, it is completely wrong,, At present",31
NA,an industrial pattern is beginning to,31
NA,take shape which is similar to the pattern,31
NA,that was woven before the 1917 upheaval.,31
Mr SPEAKER ,Orde r 1 The honor-,31
NA,able member's time has expired.,31
Mr DAVIDSON ,Dawson) [4.22] - I,31
NA,was more than amused a few moments,31
NA,ago to hear the honorable member for,31
NA,Watson ( Mr Curtin) say that primary,31
NA,producers in the Australian Country,31
NA,"party had, from time to time, threatened",31
NA,to withhold their produce from the,31
NA,market. That statement should not be,31
NA,"given any serious attention at all, and I",31
NA,"can say from long experience, as an active",31
NA,primary producer and as a member of,31
NA,"primary producers' organizations, that",31
NA,the statement is quite incorrect. Pri-,31
NA,mary producers are the greatest wealth,31
NA,"producers in this country, because of the",31
NA,"sale of their products overseas, and they",31
NA,bave too great a sense of responsibility,31
NA,for the well-being of the Australian,31
NA,people even to consider withholding their,31
NA,produce. I t is unfortunate that the bodies,31
NA,represented by the honorable member for,31
NA,Watson do not have a similar sense of,31
NA,responsibility.,31
NA,"His Excellency, in the Speech that he",31
NA,delivered at the opening of this Parlia-,31
NA,"ment, made two important references to",31
NA,the intention of the Government with,31
NA,"regard to national development. First,",31
NA,he said-,31
NA,My Government will closely examine thc,31
NA,"extent to which additional transport links,",31
NA,"including rail links, are desirable for the",31
NA,development of beef production in north,31
NA,Queensland and the Northern Territory.,31
NA,"Secondly, he said-",31
NA,"In the Territories of the Commonwealth, on",31
NA,"the foundations laid in the past three years,",31
NA,further progressmay be confidently expected,31
NA,both in the advancement of the welfare of the,31
NA,people and in the development of resources.,31
NA,In Papua and New Guinea the rate of in-,31
NA,vestigation and classification of land and \v;:ter,31
NA,resources and agricultural output will be in-,31
NA,creased. Expanded services will improve the,31
NA,"health, education and social statu:) of the",31
NA,natives.,31
NA,"I welcome those two statements, of Go-",31
NA,vernment policy with regard to national,31
NA,"development, and I propose to comment",31
NA,on. both of them. The first statement,31
NA,"applies to the development, of the northern",31
NA,"portion of Australia, which .includes",32
NA,the north-west of Western Aus-,32
NA,"tralia, the northern part of the",32
NA,Nor thern Territory and the North-,32
NA,western and northern parts of Queens-,32
NA,"land. That great area of land, which",32
NA,stretches across the north of our con-,32
NA,"tinent, is very sparsely settled and sadly",32
NA,in need of development. For many years,32
NA,most people have realized that it should,32
NA,"be developed, but there has been a lack",32
NA,of positive action in that direction.,32
NA,The result is tbat that great area is still,32
NA,crying aloud for a concerted plan of,32
NA,development by both State and Federal,32
NA,governments. The nation can no longer,32
NA,afford to pay only lip service to the cause,32
NA,of development nor can it rely on,32
NA,spasmodic investigations by committees.,32
NA,We must move rapidly towards the prac-,32
NA,tical development of that area-,32
NA,"I t is generally known, I think, that",32
NA,"main source of wealth and, therefore, the",32
NA,most important factor in the development,32
NA,"of this area, is the meat industry. I t is",32
NA,true that mineral discoveries in recent,32
NA,years indicate that there is a certain,32
NA,future for the northern parts of Australia,32
NA,"in mineral production, and it is also true,",32
NA,as the Minister for Territories ( Mr.,32
NA,"Hasluck) stated a few moments ago, that",32
NA,the area may be suitable for small farms.,32
NA,"I n the main, however, we must apply OUT-",32
NA,selves to the production of beef. A l -,32
NA,though such production has been carried,32
NA,"on for many years, the ceiling rate of",32
NA,"production was reached, under prevailing",32
NA,"conditions, some time ago. We must try",32
NA,to ascertain the reasons for the existence,32
NA,of that ceiling. Immediately we under-,32
NA,"take such an investigation, I suggest that",32
NA,the most cogent reason will be found to,32
NA,lie in tbe inadequate transport facilities.,32
NA,"His Excellency the Governor-General,",32
NA,in the Speech which he made in this,32
NA,"House recently, stated that the Govern-",32
NA,ment had committed itself closely to,32
NA,-examine the extent to which additional,32
NA,"transport links, including rail links, were",32
NA,necessary in this area. To my way of,32
NA,"-thinking, that was a very important",32
NA,"aspect of the Speech. Of course, there",32
NA,are otber factors involved in the failure,32
NA,to expand the beef industry in recent,32
NA,"years, but i t seems to me that those factors",32
NA,-are largely associated with agricultural,32
NA,and pastoral practice. I t would be idle,32
NA,"for us to provide, say, better watering",32
NA,"facilities and better management, with a",32
NA,"view to increasing beef production, unless",32
NA,"we also improved transport facilities,",32
NA,because the provision of the other facili-,32
NA,ties to which I have referred would,32
NA,merely serve to accentuate the inadequacy,32
NA,of the transport system.,32
NA,"Under present conditions, cattlemen",32
NA,are forced to walk their cattle for,32
NA,hundreds of miles before they arrive at,32
NA,tbe rail head. Such journeys are gene-,32
NA,rally through inhospitable and badly-,32
NA,"watered country, with the result that the",32
NA,gTaziers are not able to dispose of their,32
NA,stock until they are at least four years',32
NA,old. Young cattle cannot stand up to the,32
NA,strenuous journeys which are necessary.,32
NA,"For that reason, graziers are compelled",32
NA,to keep their stock far beyond the time,32
NA,"when they would produce young, good",32
NA,"the quality beef. I n addition, even when the",32
NA,"stock arrive at the railhead, they still",32
NA,have to face long jolting journeys over,32
NA,rough railway systems. The result of all,32
NA,this is that second quality beef is being,32
NA,produced from that area.,32
NA,The markets available to our heef,32
NA,industry have an important bearing on,32
NA,"t.he points I wish to make. There is, of",32
NA,"course, our home market. One frequently",32
NA,hears criticism by housewives and others,32
NA,"that, despite the fact that Australia claims",32
NA,to be one of the major beef-producing,32
NA,"countries of the world, the beef they",32
NA,purchase in the butchers' shops is often,32
NA,"of very poor quality. Then, we have the",32
NA,market provided for us under the recently,32
NA,arranged contract with Great Britain. I f,32
NA,we are to retain that market we must pro-,32
NA,duce beef of the highest quality. The,32
NA,British people made it very plain recently,32
NA,that they require good quality meat and,32
NA,"will no longer be satisned, as thcy were in",32
NA,"the past, with the second-grade beef whicE",32
NA,we produced because we killed rattle,32
NA,which were too old and which had been,32
NA,subjected to rigorous conditions wbile,32
NA,-being brought to market.,32
NA,The plan to develop our northern areas,32
NA,must concern itself not only with the,32
NA,"provision of extra transport facilities, but'",32
NA,also with means to enable tbe meat,32
NA,industry to turn out the highest quality,32
NA,beef that is possible. All the remedies,32
NA,that have been suggested for the present,32
NA,difficulties rely on the provision of more,32
NA,"railways. During the last year or so, the",33
NA,proposals most generally considered have,33
NA,included the extension of one of the,33
NA,"Queensland railway lines into the west,",33
NA,from Dajarra to a point on the Barkly,33
NA,"Tableland. The phrase ""the Dajarra",33
NA,"railway "" has come into common use, par-",33
NA,ticularly in Queensland. Another pro-,33
NA,posal is that the railway line should be,33
NA,"extended from Darwin, through Oentral",33
NA,"Australia, to link up with Alice Springs.",33
NA,E am not satisned that either of those two,33
NA,"proposed rail links, or any other rail",33
NA,would be the best method of develop-,33
NA,"ing our northern areas, but if we",33
NA,are to pin our faith to railway,33
NA,"lines, it is necessary for us to consider",33
NA,what the provision of an adequate service,33
NA,for the whole area would involve. I sub-,33
NA,mit that this Government must concern,33
NA,itself not only with a portion of the total,33
NA,"area, such as the Barkly Tableland, but",33
NA,with the whole of the northern portion,33
NA,of the Commonwealth. I f that area is to,33
NA,"be provided with adequate rail links,",33
NA,railway lines must be provided from the,33
NA,"back country to the northern parts,",33
NA,"Derby, Wyndham and Darwin, and from",33
NA,the Barkly Tableland to the Queensland,33
NA,"rail termini. Further, the Queensland",33
NA,term ini must be connected to thc,33
NA,Channel country and north-western New,33
NA,South Wales. Only by means of such a,33
NA,rail system could we deal adequately witb,33
NA,the present situation.,33
NA,Now we must consider the cost of sucb,33
NA,an undertaking in relation to the benents,33
NA,that it would provide. The cost would be,33
NA,"enormous, and it would take many years to",33
NA,complete the work. It has been estimated,33
NA,that the cost of extending the line,33
NA,from Dajarra to Newcastle Waters would,33
NA,"be at least £20,000,000. That is the most",33
NA,conservative estimate I have seen. Some,33
NA,"estimates are as high as £40,000,000.",33
NA,Since the cost of only a small extension,33
NA,"would be so great, it can be appreciated",33
NA,that the cost of the network which,33
NA,I consider essential would be hundreds,33
NA,of millions of pounds. I,33
NA,cede tbat the provision of such,33
NA,railways would improve conditions,33
NA,and enable graziers to shift their store,33
NA,cattle from drought areas. The railways,33
NA,would enable cattle to be brought,33
NA,"down to the Channel country, possibly",33
NA,"even to the coastal areas of Queensland,",33
NA,Jfr. Davidson.,33
NA,"for fattening, and weaners and young,",33
NA,"stock could be moved, which is not possible",33
NA,at the present time. But the provision,33
NA,of those railways would not result in the,33
NA,production of good quality young beef.,33
NA,The graziers still would be obliged to,33
NA,place the stock on rail and to subject,33
NA,them to rough railway travel for a,33
NA,week or more. There would still be an,33
NA,enormous loss from bruising. That loss,33
NA,is estimated to amount to more than,33
NA,"£1,000,000 per annum in Queensland",33
NA,"link, alone. There would still be the loss of",33
NA,"weight, the value of which in Queensland",33
NA,also is estimated to be more than,33
NA,"£1,000,000 per annum. I n my opinion,",33
NA,the expenditure of a large amount of,33
NA,money for the provision of railways,33
NA,"would not overcome the difficulties, and",33
NA,we would not attain the final objective,33
NA,of good quality young beef.,33
NA,"In recent years, the movement of beef",33
NA,by air transport bas been developed.,33
NA,Although that system has not yet proved,33
NA,"to be completely successful, it is worthy",33
NA,of trial by the Government. For some,33
NA,"years a small company, assisted by go-",33
NA,"vernment subsidy, has been transporting",33
NA,beef by air from Glenroy to Wyndham,33
NA,on the north-western coast of Western,33
NA,Australia. The operations of that com-,33
NA,pany have proved that a large-scale in-,33
NA,troduction of this method of transport,33
NA,throughout Australia would be accom-,33
NA,panied by an element of success. Many,33
NA,people have denounced tbe scheme. Such,33
NA,"a scheme, to be successful, must be con-",33
NA,ducted in association with relatively small,33
NA,inland abattoirs each of wbich would serve,33
NA,an area within a radius of 50 miles. I t,33
NA,would be necessary for tbose abattoirs,33
NA,to be serviced by freighter aircraft which,33
NA,would take the chilled beef direct to the,33
NA,"railhead or seaport. The grazier, after",33
NA,"walking his cattle for only 50 miles,",33
NA,could bring them in as prime quality,33
NA,two-year-olds without any loss of weight.,33
NA,The scheme has also demonstrated that,33
NA,the grazier need not keep a large,33
NA,con- herd of scrubbers on his property,33
NA,because he cannot afford to move them.,33
NA,"I n other words, the grazier is enabled to",33
NA,double his carrying capacity.,33
NA,The airlift scheme has proved that it,33
NA,is worthy of wider experimentation by,33
NA,the Government. I hope that His Excel-,33
NA,lency's statement means that further con-,33
NA,sideration will be given to tbe problem,34
NA,and that the Government will test tbe,34
NA,"scheme, not by seeking a report, but by",34
NA,"experimentation, with the result tbat",34
NA,within a short space of time it will be,34
NA,able to ascertain whether it is worth-,34
NA,"while saying to the industry, "" We are",34
NA,prepared to subsidize air beef by so much,34
NA,per lb. and leave it to private enterprise to,34
NA,supply the abattoirs and the freighter,34
NA,aircraft with which to inaugurate the,34
NA,"scheme"". I f the scheme proved to be",34
NA,"successful, within a period of five years",34
NA,we would see a marked difference in the,34
NA,development of the northern areas of,34
NA,Australia. I f the Government were to,34
NA,apply itself only to an extension of the,34
NA,"raihvay line beyond Dajarra, the line",34
NA,would not be completed within at least,34
NA,five years.,34
NA,I refer now to a somewhat similar,34
NA,problem in the Territory of Papua and,34
NA,New Guinea. I call it a Somewhat,34
NA,"similar problem, because it is associated",34
NA,"with the development of that Territory,",34
NA,but of course i t differs in certain respects,34
NA,from the one to which I have just re-,34
NA,ferred. Papua is an Australian posses-,34
NA,"sion, but the Territory of New Guinea",34
NA,is held by Australia under a trusteeship.,34
NA,There are difficult problems associated,34
NA,"witb the civilizing of the natives,",34
NA,"and we have to be guided, not only",34
NA,"by our own humanitarian principles, but",34
NA,also by certain general principles which,34
NA,are laid down in the United Nations,34
NA,Charter under which we hold the trustee-,34
NA,ship. We must ensure that we l i f t the,34
NA,natives from a somewhat primitive state,34
NA,to a state in which they are capable of,34
NA,governing themselves. We must also,34
NA,ensure that their inalienable rights to,34
NA,the land on which they live are preserved.,34
NA,"Those are tasks of great magnitude, and",34
NA,tasks in relation to which a great deal of,34
NA,"experience, tolerance and determination",34
NA,must be exercised i f they are to be per-,34
NA,formed satisfactorily. Associated with,34
NA,that problem is the problem of the eco-,34
NA,nomic development of the Territory of,34
NA,Papua and New Guinea. Australia is,34
NA,"tackling the problem, but it is important",34
NA,that we should proceed more rapidly,34
NA,than we have been proceeding because of,34
NA,the importance of the Territory to Aus-,34
NA,"tralia, not only from the economic point",34
NA,"of view, but also from the defence point",34
NA,of view.,34
NA,The majority of people realize that a,34
NA,rapid development of Papua and New,34
NA,Guinea is vital to Australia. The problem,34
NA,of the economic development of Papua,34
NA,and New Guinea is one that calls for the,34
NA,bringing into production of vast areas,34
NA,that are virgin jungle country. Any one,34
NA,who has been there knows that a lot of the,34
NA,country is what i3 commonly described as,34
NA,tiger country and that it cannot be,34
NA,developed easily. Although it cannot be,34
NA,"developed easily, it is country that would",34
NA,handsomely repay the expenditure of,34
NA,capital and effort. The extensive use,34
NA,of machinery is necessary for its rapid,34
NA,development. J. do not know whether,34
NA,the Minister for Territories ( Mr.,34
NA,"Hasluck) agrees with me, but I believe",34
NA,that there is not available in Papua or,34
NA,New Guinea a pool of cheap native labour,34
NA,upon which we can draw in order to,34
NA,service the projects upon wbich we wish,34
NA,to embark.,34
Mr HASLUCK ,Tha t is quite correct.,34
Mr DAVIDSON ,"Therefore , any",34
NA,"plan under which, the Government seeks",34
NA,"to develop the Teriitory, or under which",34
NA,"it seeks to assist private enterprise,",34
NA,"depends, not only upon the acquisition",34
NA,of the land from the natives on just and,34
NA,"proper terms, but also upon the expendi-",34
NA,ture of a large amount of capital for the,34
NA,provision of mechanical equipment. The,34
NA,Government could play an important part,34
NA,by providing capital on suitable terms.,34
NA,There is also a need for large-scale experi-,34
NA,mentation. The Department of Com-,34
NA,merce and Agriculture has made a valu-,34
NA,able contribution in the solving of agricul-,34
NA,"tural problems, in the provision of better",34
NA,"varieties of rubber trees, in the develop-",34
NA,ment of cocoa production and the produc-,34
NA,tion of other agricultural items such as,34
NA,kenaf fibre. That assistance requires the,34
NA,"expenditure of money. For that reason,",34
NA,I was pleased to hear the reference by His,34
NA,Excellency to the fact that the rate of,34
NA,investigation and classification of land,34
NA,and water resources would be increased.,34
NA,I sincerely hope that the Government,34
NA,realizes that the fulfilment of the under-,34
NA,taking will require the expenditure of,34
NA,more money. Increased expenditure on,34
NA,an expansion of the work at present being,34
NA,undertaken by the Papua and New,34
NA,Guinea Administration and the Aus-,34
NA,tralian Government not only will,34
NA,"accelerate .development of the Territory,",35
NA,"but. also will return good, dividends to",35
NA,Australia. The flow of exports from any,35
NA,"area, particularly from a new country",35
NA,such as the Territory of Papua and New,35
NA,"Guinea, is a reliable indication of the",35
NA,manner in which development is proceed-,35
NA,ine. The latest reports available reveal,35
NA,that exports from Papua in 1948-49,35
NA,"amounted to £934,112. I n 1952-53,",35
NA,"Panuan exports totalled £2,322,905. I n",35
NA,four years the value of exports from this,35
NA,"Territory increased by £1,388,793. This",35
NA,i.s an indication of the rate at which the,35
NA,Territory is developing. I n the same,35
NA,period exports from New Guinea in-,35
NA,"'-reased from £4,234,978 to £8,491,396.",35
NA,Mr .SPEAKER -Order ! The honor-,35
NA,able member's time has expired.,35
Mr JOSHUA ,Ballarat) [4.47] -Th e,35
NA,remarks of the honorable member for,35
NA,Dawson ( Mr Davidson) were of great,35
NA,"interest to the House, because they",35
NA,followed practical lines. Thoughts ex-,35
NA,pressed in this manner are encouraging,35
NA,to the entire community. I am sure that,35
NA,the honorable member will agree that i f,35
NA,Australia is to receive the f u l l benefit,35
NA,such developments as the transport of,35
NA,"prime beef by air, we must make certain",35
NA,"organizational changes, and it is to that",35
NA,aspect of our affairs that I wish to,35
NA,address myself. When I was elected to,35
NA,"this House in 1951, tbe Australian Com-",35
NA,monwealth was celebrating its jubilee,35
NA,"after 50 years of federation, and i t was",35
NA,not necessary for any one then to say,35
NA,"that the old idea,of Empire had gorse,",35
NA,and that Australia was well established as,35
NA,an independent nation.. The entire coun-,35
NA,try resounded with speeches expressing,35
NA,those sentiments. Since 1951 our national,35
NA,"objectives, have become obscure. Aus-",35
NA,tralia has faltered in its progress to-,35
NA,"wards its goal, which should bave been",35
NA,stated in the strongest possible terms in,35
NA,the Governor-General's Speech'.,35
NA,omission to do that caused me much dis-,35
NA,appointment. Australia's economic and.,35
NA,military independence must be sought,35
NA,"with the utmost vigour, but theGovern-",35
NA,ment seemsto have neglected the need,35
NA,"for vigorous action.. Certainly, economic,",35
NA,"and military independence are being,",35
NA,"sought, but not with vigour. I do not",35
NA,want any one to think that my reference,35
NA,tO' military independence is. intended to,35
NA,"convey that in my view Australia can, be",35
NA,so well armed and powerful that it can,35
NA,defeat any adversary. That is not soi I,35
NA,mean tbat Australia must become comv,35
NA,"pletely independent, of other countries",35
NA,for its supplies i n the event of its having,35
NA,to take part in any conflict. I believe,35
NA,that we can enjoy the full benefitsof OUT.,35
NA,"natural resources, and of much of the",35
NA,progress of which the honorable member,35
NA,"for Dawson spoke, by looking more to our",35
NA,economic independence than to basing,35
NA,our economy on overseas markets.,35
Mr HAMILTON ,Wha t does the honor-,35
NA,able member mean by tbat remark?',35
Mr JOSHUA ,Th e honorable mem-,35
NA,beiwill understand as I proceed. The,35
NA,Governor-General's Speech stated Aus-,35
NA,"tralia's goal in loose, vague and easy-",35
NA,"going terms. I n fact, one cannot learn",35
NA,from it what our goal is. Tbe Governor-,35
NA,"General said, at page 1 of the printed 1",35
NA,copy of the Speech-,35
NA,My advisers regard their responsibilities,35
NA,during the life of this Parliament to be the-,35
NA,"strengthening of Australia's security, the",35
NA,"maintenance of a healthy economy, the-",35
NA,"of developmentof. our national, resources, and'",35
NA,the social welfare of the Australian people-,35
NA,"That sounds pleasant, but it might be said*",35
NA,about any new nation. There is nothing,35
NA,new in that part of the Governor-,35
NA,General's Speech. The Governor-General,35
NA,"said also, at page 2 of the printed copy",35
NA,of his Speech-,35
NA,My Government is undertaking a re-organiza-,35
NA,tion of the defence programme to achieve the--,35
NA,maximum security,35
NA,"He does not say "" independent security ""--",35
NA,"that the eountry can provide for a long period,",35
NA,having regard t'o the needs not only of defence-,35
NA,"but also of economic stability, a steady develops",35
NA,"ment of population and resources, and high-",35
NA,levels of production and employment.,35
NA,That sort of thing lulled some honorable,35
NA,"members off to sleep. I noticed, while tbe",35
NA,The Governor-General was delivering his,35
NA,"Speech, that, in spite of hi? efforts to",35
NA,"make it sound interesting, a number of",35
NA,honorable members nodded their heads,35
NA,and went to sleep. Their slumber seemed,35
NA,"to become even moredeepwhen, at page",35
NA,"3 of the printed copy of the Speech, the",35
NA,Governor-General observed-,35
NA,I t is a fundamental' part of the' policy of,35
NA,my Government tliat the development of Aus-,35
NA,"tralia should, proceed at the highest practicable'",35
NA,rate. This requires an adequate supply of,35
NA,(labour ana materials-; sound policies for,36
NA,.encouraging .private investment and an inflow,36
NA,"of capital; . , .",36
NA,"Tliese declarations sound encouraging, but",36
NA,tbey really mean little. A clear and,36
NA,definite statement of Australia's goal as,36
NA,a .nation and of measures to achieve and,36
NA,maintain .economic and military indepen-,36
NA,"dence is clearly necessary, and should",36
NA,have been .given on this occasion. One,36
NA,might have taken a little comfort had,36
NA,the Speech promised action to achieve,36
NA,Australia's national goal. The Govern-,36
NA,ment -will be judged in the future on its,36
NA,".present actions, but the Governor-",36
NA,O.eneral'is Speech contained no promise,36
NA,of action. All that is proposed is merely,36
NA,the sidestepping of the Government's,36
NA,"responsibilities, as the Governor-General",36
NA,"-clearly revealed, when he said at page",36
NA,'4 of the printed copy of his Speeeh-,36

NA,on the 'Tariff Board.,36
NA,"The Speech, of course, is made on the",36
NA,advice of the Prime Minister. I do not,36
NA,"throw stones at the Tariff Board, which,",36
NA,"to the best of its ability, has done valuable",36
NA,work foT Australian industries. How-,36
NA,"ever, at present the board is clearly",36
NA,floundering and wondering what its,36
NA,"objectives really are, because the Govern-",36
NA,ment has failed to give to it a clear state-,36
NA,ment of the goal at whieh i t sbould aim.,36
NA,"The Government has no ideas of its own,",36
NA,'but will look for advice to the Tariff,36
NA,"Board, a subsidiary body that is dependent",36
NA,mi the Government for its instructions.,36
NA,"The board, at page 8 of its report for",36
NA,"fhe year ended on the 3'0'th June, 1953,",36
NA,"-reported, under the heading Tlie Board's",36

NA,to reverse current tendencies and to create,36

NA,That is a lamentable statement. I t is,36
NA,completely unrealistic to say that a 'small,36

NA,the need for increased managerial effi-,36
NA,"ciency, greater efficiency on the part of",36
NA,"the workers, the avoidance of lost time,",36
NA,and tbe like. The highest possible,36
NA,efficiency should be encouraged at all,36
NA,".times, and no .special comment on this",36
NA,.aspect of the economy should be neces-,36
NA,sary. Management should at all times,36
NA,"strive for the highest possible efficiency,",36
NA,just as the workers .should always make,36
NA,their best efforts and bear their respon-,36
NA,"sibilities in mind, as they usually do. The",36
NA,points emphasized .by the Tariff Board,36
NA,are trivial and by no means constitute a,36
NA,solution of the difficulties that confront.,36
NA,Australia at present. The Government,36
NA,showed that it was relying upon the ad-,36
NA,vice of the Tariff Board by putting into,36
NA,advice the Governor-General's Speech a para-,36
NA,phrase of the board's words. His,36
NA,Excellency stated-,36
NA,"My Government regards i t as essential, how",36
NA,"ever, to the healthy and permanent develop-",36
NA,ment of manufacturing industries in' Aus-,36
NA,-tralia that tliere .should be a continuing drive,36
NA,by all concerned to increase efiiciency :and pro-,36
NA,duction and reduce costs. A l l thc techniques,36
NA,of modern management need to be brought v<,36
NA,bear on the problem.; concurrently tiie trafli-,36
NA,unions must realize that higher standards of,36
NA,living will be achieved through greater pro,36
NA,"ductivity, which will come from greater team-",36
NA,work between employers and employees.,36
NA,The word productivity is the real key to,36
NA,the situation. The Government is lacking,36
NA,in ideas and its acceptance of the ideas,36
NA,that are put forward by the Tariff Board,36
NA,as a basis for the organization of Aus-,36
NA,tralia is lamentable indeed. We have to,36
NA,view consider productivity because another,36
NA,"the tribunal, a great judicial - tribunal, has",36
NA,to the need for closer examination,36
NA,of the productivity of Australia. I f the,36
NA,these Government proposes to make -use of,36
NA,various judicial bodies and boards that are,36
NA,"appointed by i t , it should set out clearly",36
NA,"the functions 'of those instrumentalities,",36
NA,"and arrange matters, so far as it is able, to",36
NA,ensure that they are not faced with great,36
NA,"difficulties. The Tariff Board, which has",36
NA,"been increased in .size, is now preparing",36
NA,to make a tariff recommenedation which,36
NA,will affect practically every industry in,37
NA,"Australia, and in order to ensure its",37
NA,successful implementation a high rate of,37
NA,protection will have to be afforded. I,37
NA,believe that the Tariff Board is faced,37
NA,with a difficult situation. I t is wondering,37
NA,about its objectives and where its func-,37
NA,tions will end.,37
NA,The Tariff Board is only one of a,37
NA,number of boards and tribunals of,37
NA,which the Government makes use and,37
NA,behind which it hides at times. The,37
NA,Oommonwealth Court of Conciliation and,37
NA,Arbitration is an organization behind,37
NA,which the Government is particularly,37
NA,fond of hiding. The court fixes the wages,37
NA,of the workers in the community. The,37
NA,absence of any wage policy from the,37
NA,Governor-General's Speech is even more,37
NA,lamentable than the Government's failure,37
NA,to set out the goal of Australia in precise,37
NA,and strong terms. The court has made,37
NA,very far-reaching decisions. A highly,37
NA,important judgment was issued by it in,37
NA,"1953. I n my opinion, that judgment",37
NA,definitely threw into the court of this,37
NA,Parliament the responsibility for deciding,37
NA,what the Australian wages future will be.,37
NA,"At the same time, the Arbitration Court",37
NA,rejected any responsibility for the results.,37
NA,In its reasons for the judgment it made,37
NA,"in 1953, the court set out precisely its",37
NA,"functions, and it showed in definite terms",37
NA,that the Government would be responsible,37
NA,in future for happenings resulting from,37
NA,its actions or lack of actions. At page 29,37
NA,of the judgment the court stated-,37
NA,I t is not the function of the Court to aim at agricultural,37
NA,such social and economic changes as may seem,37
NA,to be desirable to the menibers of the tribunal.,37
NA,The functions of the Court must be exercised,37
NA,in the social and economic setting of thc time,37
NA,at which i t makes its decision. I t must settle,37
NA,industrial disputes upon terms which seem,37
NA,"to i t to be just, having regard to conditions",37
NA,which exist at the time of its decision. A just,37
NA,decision is not made i f the Court refuses action,37
NA,which is shown to be proper in the hope or,37
NA,expectation that some other authority w i l !,37
NA,"move; on the other hand, the Court will not",37
NA,make an award whieh wili become just only i f,37
NA,-mother authority moves to correct the in-,37
NA,"justice. To the best of its ability, the Court",37
NA,should . . . view the whole picture of the,37
NA,national economy as presented for its con-,37
NA,sideration.,37
NA,That statement throws into the court of,37
NA,this Parliament the responsibility for,37
NA,ensuring that matters are arranged so,37
NA,that the court's decision will afford justice,37
NA,Mr Joshua.,37
NA,to the whole community. I t throws on to,37
NA,the shoulders of the Government responsi-,37
NA,bility to make such arrangements before,37
NA,the court reaches its decision. The court,37
NA,made another very important decision.,37
NA,I t abolished the whole idea that wages in,37
NA,Australia in future would be decided on,37
NA,the needs of the people. I t stated most,37
NA,emphatically that in future the produc-,37
NA,tivity of Australia would be the basis,37
NA,upon which wages would be decided. The,37
NA,court was very precise in its terms. I t,37
NA,"said, virtually, that after consideration of",37
NA,"some matters, wages would be decided, in",37
NA,"the main, by assessing the productivity of",37
NA,Australia in Australian pounds. The,37
NA,court would take the figures for the whole,37
NA,of Australian consumption and value it,37
NA,in Australian pounds. I t would then,37
NA,consider all Australian exports and value,37
NA,them in Australian pounds. The two,37
NA,added together would be divided roughly,37
NA,hy the population and some idea of the,37
NA,productivity of the nation would thus be,37
NA,gained. When other matters are taken in-,37
NA,"to consideration, that was one of the most",37
NA,important declarations ever made by the,37
NA,court. Its decision and its declaration of,37
NA,future procedure'showed clearly that the,37
NA,Government had great responsibilities.,37
NA,The Government's lack of a policy on,37
NA,wages may cause great hardship to the,37
NA,people despite a marked increase in their,37
NA,efforts which should be suitably rewarded.,37
NA,Agricultural exports are the main,37
NA,substance of our overseas trade.,37
NA,Very little of our secondary industry,37
NA,manufactures are exported. Our,37
NA,exports are declining.,37
NA,Markets are disappearing. Wheat is our,37
NA,"second largest export, but the future of",37
NA,"the wheat market is most uncertain, and",37
NA,the Governor-General stated in his Speech,37
NA,that sales of wheat had been very slow.,37
NA,The butter market overseas is deteriorat-,37
NA,ing and that applies also to cheese. The,37
NA,sugar market does not give us any great,37
NA,hope and the price that is paid for our,37
NA,sugar overseas is very much lower than,37
NA,the Australian price. A similar position,37
NA,applies in relation to dried fruits and,37
NA,wines. The prices for many of our,37
NA,products that are sold overseas are falling.,37
NA,"I f our production increases, we must",37
NA,expect the markets to decline still further.,37
NA,What effect will that situation have,37
NA,upon the Australian wage level in view of,37
NA,the fact that it will be assessed in the,38
NA,manner that the Commonwealth Court,38
NA,of Conciliation and Arbitration has indi-,38
NA,cated? I t is clear that Australian con-,38
NA,sumption will be easily ascertained. I f,38
NA,"that were all that had to be considered,",38
NA,our volume of production could be easily,38
NA,"ascertained, but it is not so. The produc-",38
NA,tivity of the nation will be the value of,38
NA,Australian consumption plus the price,38
NA,received for the goods that are exported,38
NA,overseas. While wheat and dairy farmers,38
NA,"and, indeed, all primary producers are",38
NA,working tbeir fingers to the bone and,38
NA,Australian workers are actively produc-,38
NA,"ing goods, priees may be so low that the",38
NA,combined yield will show a decline in,38
NA,productivity. As a result the court will,38
NA,reduce wages. There is no indication of a,38
NA,wage policy in the Governor-General's,38
NA,Speecli. The Government has no wage,38
NA,policy. I f tbere is a further serious,38
NA,"-decline in overseas markets, which is a",38
NA,"strong possibility, the result will be a",38
NA,reduction of wages. That would not be,38
NA,so bad i f such a reduction were accom-,38
NA,panied by increased ability on the part of,38
NA,tbe workers to buy the results of their,38
NA,"labours, but that will not be so, because",38
NA,we shall find that the goods produced by,38
NA,Australians will not be available to them,38
NA,at the reduced prices at whicb they will,38
NA,be offered overseas. According to the,38
NA,degree of protection that is given to,38
NA,"secondary industry, they will be obliged",38
NA,"to pay high prices, not only for manu-",38
NA,"factured articles, but also for bread,",38
NA,is directly affected by the long-term,38
NA,"wheat industry stabilization plan, butter,",38
NA,"sugar, and many other primary pro-",38
NA,ducts. The average Australian's wages,38
NA,"will be reduced, but he will be obliged to",38
NA,"pay increased taxes and, therefore, will",38
NA,not derive any benefit from his increased,38
NA,productivity.,38
NA,This position is fraught with grave,38
NA,sequences. The absence of a statement,38
NA,of the Government's policy in respect of,38
NA,was a grave omission from the Governorthat,38
NA,General's Speech. That Speech should,38
NA,have been more dynamic. I t should have,38
NA,contained some forceful indication,38
NA,"the Government has at its hand, and",38
NA,"intends to use, means to put these matters adjustment.",38
NA,"right. For instance, the Speech should",38
NA,have mentioned the Government's power,38
NA,to alter the exchange rate i f circumstances,38
NA,arose to warrant such action. The present,38
NA,exchange rate has been fixed since 1931;,38
NA,"that is over twenty years ago, and nearly",38
NA,every one appears to think that it will,38
NA,always remain so fixed whilst many see no,38
NA,reason why it should be altered. How-,38
NA,"ever, i f our overseas markets should",38
NA,"deteriorate, the Government, by altering",38
NA,"the exchange rate, could ensure that jus-",38
NA,tice shall be done to the Australian people,38
NA,and that they shall receive some benefit,38
NA,from tbeir increased productivity. Every,38
NA,one is prepared to increase his or her pro-,38
NA,ductivity in secondary and primary indus-,38
NA,tries. Let us not be content to work for,38
NA,something that we shall never really,38
NA,attain; rather let us work for something,38
NA,from which we shall gain real benefit. I f,38
NA,"our overseas markets deteriorated, an",38
NA,alteration of the exchange rate would be of,38
NA,"enormous advantage to Australia. First,",38
NA,"it would relieve the pressure , that is now",38
NA,being exerted upon the Tariff Board for,38
NA,higher levels' of protection. This could,38
NA,be done by effecting appropriate economic,38
NA,"adjustments, and, I suggest, such an",38
NA,adjustment could be made by altering the,38
NA,exchange rate.,38
Mr MCLEOD ,U p or down ?,38
Mr JOSHUA ,B y further depreciat-,38
NA,ing the Australian f l in relation to,38
NA,sterling and dollars. The Australian £1,38
NA,must be depreciated further i f we are to,38
NA,safeguard ourselves against the ravages,38
NA,that any deterioration of our overseas,38
NA,which markets must cause. The honorable mem-,38
NA,ber for Warringah ( Mr Bland) is shak-,38
NA,ing his head. No doubt he is thinking,38
NA,solely of existing circumstances. I suggest,38
NA,that within a brief period he may be,38
NA,nodding his head very emphatically in,38
NA,"agreement, with that statement. We recall",38
NA,the advantages that accrued to Australia,38
NA,when the Australian £1 was drastically,38
NA,depreciated in 1931. That action resulted,38
NA,conin the disposal of large surpluses of our,38
NA,"primary products and, at the same time,",38
NA,it discouraged imports. Import restrictions,38
NA,have been operative for some time,38
NA,"and will, I believe, be continued for a",38
NA,"further considerable period, could be dis-",38
NA,that pensed with i f the Government had,38
NA,recourse to other means of economic,38
Mr DOWNER ,B y how much does the,38
NA,honorable member suggest that the Aus-,38
NA,tralian £1 should be further depreciated?,38
Mr JOSHUA ,Tinde r the terms of,39
NA,onr arrangement with the International,39
NA,Rank for Reconstruction and Development,39
NA,we would be permitted to depreciate it by,39
NA,"another 10 per cent., that is £2 10s. per",39
NA,centum; but I think that that amount,39
NA,would be insufficient. We should depre-,39
NA,ciate our currency i f signs appear that our,39
NA,overseas markets are deteriorating: We,39
NA,should implement a programme designed,39
NA,to offset any serious dislocation of Aus-,39
NA,tralian industry. The banking system,39
NA,offers adequate facilities for buying,39
NA,forward. Sucb action would not increase,39
NA,the prices of Australian manufactured,39
NA,goods. Those prices have been increased,39
NA,artificially as a result of high tariff,39
NA,"protection. At the same time, Aus-",39
NA,"tralians would be able to buy butter,",39
NA,"bread and otber necessaries of life, at tbe",39
NA,prices that prevail for such products at,39
NA,present. Further depreciation of the,39
NA,Australian £1 would afford greater pro-,39
NA,"tectionto our secondary industries and,",39
NA,"in due course, with careful planning, pro-",39
NA,vide relief to our primary producers.,39
NA,"Above all, such action would stabilize",39
NA,.Australian wage levels. I t would be of,39
NA,sri-eat benefit to the people as a whole.,39
NA,"Finally, i t would enable us to attain our",39
NA,"jy-eat goal, by making us less dependent",39
NA,ripon imported: products and more,39
NA,dependent upon our own manufactures.,39
Mr SPEAKER ,Orde r \ The honor-,39
NA,able member's time lias expired.,39
Mr GULLETT ,Henty) [5.10} - I con-,39
NA,gratulate the honorable member for,39
NA,Ballarat ( Mr Joshua) upon the,39
NA,"moderation of his speech, which was",39
NA,in marked contrast to the usual tone of,39
NA,speeches made .by honorable members,39
NA,opposite. Whilst I agree with many of,39
NA,"tbe things that he said,, I do not agree",39
NA,"with his suggestion that, we should further",39
NA,depreciate the Australian £1„ or that such,39
NA,"action would not have evil, effects, upon",39
NA,our economy. The very instant wa took,39
NA,"such a step, i t would result in further",39
NA,inflation in tliis country. I t is all. very,39
NA,"well to talk about, being able to sell more",39
NA,"of our products abroad. But what, would",39
NA,"such action, enable us to buy? What",39
NA,would be its effect upon the cost of Aus-,39
NA,tralian manufactures?. How much more,39
NA,would' our industries be obliged to pay for,39
NA,pliant and raw material's which they must,39
NA,import'? Not one section of secondary,39
NA,Speech.,39
NA,industry would favour such a sten. After,39
NA,"all, we are getting to a stage at which",39
NA,we are able to consume in Australia a,39
NA,very great proportion of our own manu-,39
NA,"factured goods, such as processed food-",39
NA,"stuffs, including tinned meat and fruit,",39
NA,in the manufacture of which there is arn,39
NA,increasingly large labour content. Tf the,39
NA,prices of such commodities should in-,39
NA,"crease further, what, hope should we have",39
NA,of selling them on overseas markets at,39
NA,competitive prices? The kind of argu-,39
NA,ment that the honorable member has ad-,39
NA,vanced in this instance is quite thought-,39
NA,less.,39
NA,The Governor-General's Speech,39
NA,afforded great satisfaction to supporters,39
NA,"of the Government. However, I agree",39
NA,with the honorable member for Ballarat,39
NA,tbat it was not an inspiring document.,39
NA,"I t lacked, as he said, a. statement of cer-",39
NA,"tuin. national objectives. Nevertheless, the",39
NA,"Speech detailed, certain solid achievements",39
NA,in tbis country during the post-war years.,39
NA,For example; it was delivered at a time: of,39
NA,unparalleled national prosperity. There,39
NA,has not previously been a time when the,39
NA,"average. Australian, was so well off as he",39
NA,is to-day. I t is. all very well to speak,39
NA,"about wages being pegged, and inflation,",39
NA,and to say that sections of. the com-,39
NA,"munity are hard done by; but,",39
NA,judging the Governor-General's Speech,39
NA,"hy any material yardstick, the fact",39
NA,"remains, that, to-day more Australians own",39
NA,"motor cars, refrigerators and other things",39
NA,"that, were once, regarded as luxuries, but",39
NA,are now considered to* be necessaries.,39
NA,"That fact, gives an accurate picture; of",39
NA,"conditions in this, country to-day. There",39
NA,"is work for all who want, to work, andi it",39
NA,is available at; extraordinarily remunpra -,39
NA,"tive wages.. Speaking, of wages,. I agree",39
NA,"that, a. revaluation, of margins for skill is",39
NA,"overdue. I n that respect, this. Govern-",39
NA,"ment must, take some responsibility. How-",39
NA,"ever, it is also true that honorable mem-",39
NA,"bers opposite,: likewise, are responsibfe in",39
NA,great measure for the fact'; thaf-such action,39
NA,"has not yet been, taken. After a.Ir, honor-",39
NA,:,39
NA,"able members opposite claim to represent,",39
NA,"t'he trade unions,, and those organizations",39
NA,reallv control national! policy in relation,39
NA,to labour and its reward's. Honorable,39
NA,"members opposite, are the voice of labour.",39
NA,Tbey sat on the treasury bench for eight,39
NA,"years, but they preferred to introduce a",39
NA,1,39
NA,4'0 hour week instead of increasing,39
NA,L,39
NA,margins for skill. They are the people,40
NA,who propound Labour policy in this,40
NA,"country, but only in the last year or",40
NA,"perhaps less, have the unions come out in",40
NA,favour of increased margins for skill.,40
NA,"Until then, the accent was consistently on",40
NA,raising the remuneration of the lowest,40
NA,wage-earner. I do not necessarily quarrel,40
NA,"with that. I do not agree with it, but I do",40
NA,not criticize them for having taken that,40
NA,attitude. But it is of no use for them to,40
NA,try to convince us now that for years they,40
NA,have been eating their hearts out and,40
NA,battling for increased margins for skilled,40
NA,"workers. On the contrary, a little",40
NA,research will reveal dozens of statements,40
NA,opposing any increased reward for skilled,40
NA,work. I do not wish to pursue this argu-,40
NA,ment indefinitely. I merely utter this,40
NA,word of warning: I t is of no use to regard,40
NA,every worker in the community as a,40
NA,skilled worker.,40
Mr CURTIN ,Wh y not?,40
Mr GULLETT ,Becaus e he is not,40
NA,skilled. Many trades which already,40
NA,receive a considerable loading for skill,40
NA,are skilled only to a slight degree. By,40
NA,that I mean that honorable members of,40
NA,this chamber could learn them in a few,40
NA,"months, and I do not believe that that",40
NA,represents a very high degree of skill.,40
NA,like the honorable member for Wills ( Mr.,40
NA,"Bryson), have many industrial concerns",40
NA,"in my electorate, and I daresay I know as",40
NA,much about them as he knows about the,40
NA,undertakings in his constituency. Prob-,40
NA,ably I see mine more often than he sees,40
NA,"his. I have found that, in most factories,",40
NA,both the management and the employees,40
NA,agree that the most skilled workers are,40
NA,under-paid to-day. They receive any-,40
NA,thing up to £5 above the basic wage. I n,40
NA,few instances is the margin greater than,40
NA,"that, as honorable members opposite arc",40
NA,"well aware. Take, for example, thc",40
NA,toolmaker. He is a highly skilled man,40
NA,who is required to serve a full apprenticehere to-day.,40
NA,ship and also to expend considerable sums,40
NA,"of money on tools, books and other",40
NA,requirements. A skilled toolmaker in this,40
NA,country should be rewarded as he is in,40
NA,the United Kingdom and the United,40
NA,States of America. I n those countries he,40
NA,gets a margin which brings his remunera-,40
NA,tion up to that of the well salaried man.,40
Mr CURTIN ,^-How much does he get?,40
Mr GULLETT ,Th e honorable mem-,40
NA,ber will appreciate that it is not easy to-,40
NA,pluck a figure out of the air in dollars,40
NA,that will mean anything much; but the,40
NA,toolmaker in tbe United States of America,40
NA,certainly gets up to three or four times the,40
NA,basic wage.,40
Mr CURTIN ,I n this country his-,40
NA,margin over the basic wage is £2 10s. a,40
NA,week.,40
Mr GULLETT ,Tha t is not correct,40
NA,in relation to the award about which the-,40
NA,honorable member is supposed to know,40
NA,something. I f the honorable member-,40
NA,will look at that award he will find out,40
NA,that he is wrong. I agree witb the honor-,40
NA,able member in principle that the present,40
NA,margin is insufficient; but it is of no use-,40
NA,to use the skilled worker such as the tool-,40
NA,maker or the shearer as a peg by which to,40
NA,"pull up the wages of everybody else. If""",40
NA,the honorable member really feels so,40
NA,"deeply for the riveters, boilermakers and'",40
NA,"others in whom he is interested, by all",40
NA,"means let him champion their cause, but",40
NA,they will not be helped i f they are to be-,40
NA,forced to carry unskilled persons with,40
NA,them in their claims for increased',40
NA,"margins. A margin means a difference,",40
NA,and a claim for an increased margin does-,40
NA,"I , not mean a claim for a general increase-",40
NA,of wage levels. That is my warning on.,40
NA,this subject. I f the claim for increased,40
NA,margins for skilled workers is to be used',40
NA,to attempt to increase the whole scale of,40
NA,"wages generally, regardless of skill, the",40
NA,"whole object will be defeated, and the",40
NA,skilled worker will not benefit. With,40
NA,"that sole proviso, I am prepared to go-",40
NA,just as far as any honorable member,40
NA,"opposite, ancl so is everybody else on this",40
NA,"side of the chamber, because we all realize-",40
NA,that as our economy becomes more com-,40
NA,"plex, we become more dependent upon",40
NA,"the skilled worker. I say without fear of""",40
NA,contradiction that i f it were not for,40
NA,skilled workers we should not be sitting,40
Mr CURTIN ,"No , the skilled workers-",40
NA,would be sitting here.,40
Mr GULLETT ,I t would be a change-,40
NA,to have some skilled workers. We are-,40
NA,sick of your type.,40
NA,I propose to speak now of some things-,40
NA,that were in the Governor-General's-,40
NA,"Speech itself, and then of some opinions-",40
NA,whicli His Excellency has expressed-,41
NA,as it is desirable he should-on,41
NA,public occasions. The whole Speech was,41
NA,"based, of course, on tbe belief of the",41
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies"") and his",41
NA,"advisers, which they have made clear in",41
NA,"tbis House, tbat tbe danger to this coun-",41
NA,"try is increasing and is now very great,",41
NA,"and tbat, therefore, we must all be pre-",41
NA,pared to make sacrifices in the interests,41
NA,of a greater s^mrity effort. To my way,41
NA,"of thinking, a greater defence effort does",41
NA,not mean only the pouring of money into,41
NA,armed forces. It means also a greater,41
NA,effort to establish our home security.,41
NA,His Excellency said that there would be,41
NA,an all-round increase of our defence,41
NA,"effort and, in particular, that there would",41
NA,be a greatly increased effort in respect,41
NA,of the Air Eorce and the Navy. We may,41
NA,"take it, I think, without reading any-",41
NA,thing into the Speech which was not,41
NA,"there, that the Army is to be somewhat",41
NA,"played down, while the other services are",41
NA,to be advanced. No doubt that decision,41
NA,"was taken on expert advice, and it ill-",41
NA,becomes people who cannot possibly know,41
NA,much about the subject as the advisers,41
NA,"of the Prime Minister know, to question",41
NA,"that advice. Of course, any advice",41
NA,which stresses the need for increased,41
NA,technical services rather than the train-,41
NA,ing of men for war would be welcomed,41
NA,by any government because we are faced,41
NA,with a very acute man-power shortage.,41
NA,"Therefore, I believe that the Government",41
NA,is more ready to accept that advice than,41
NA,advice to the contrary. Insofar as one,41
NA,has been able to gather Labour's defence,41
NA,policy from speeches of honorable mem-,41
NA,"bers opposite in this debate, it appears",41
NA,that they are not in favour of training,41
NA,large numbers of men. Without seeking,41
NA,"to refute the views of the experts, I",41
NA,merely wish to utter a word of warning.,41
NA,Campaigns and wars in which we have,41
NA,been involved since the end of World,41
NA,War II. have not shown that a greater,41
NA,accent is needed on the support weapons,41
NA,of the Air Force and the Navy. On the,41
NA,"contrary, we were unable to force a deci-",41
NA,sion iri' Korea because our purely military,41
NA,strength was not overwhelming com oared,41
NA,with that of the North Koreans.,41
NA,"It was not weakness in the air, because",41
NA,we had overwhelming superiority in that,41
NA,department. It was not weakness on the,41
NA,"seas, because there was no comparison",41
NA,Mr Gullett.,41
NA,between the strength of our naval forces,41
NA,other and tbat of the enemy. Exactly the,41
NA,same course of events may be observed in,41
NA,Indo-China. Tbe defeat of the French,41
NA,was due to lack of suflicient highly trained,41
NA,"and skilled troops, and to insufficient",41
NA,modern armaments. The French had,41
NA,overwhelming superiority in the other,41
NA,departments.,41
NA,"I am bound to say, too, that any pro-",41
NA,posal for a slackening of our armed,41
NA,"effort will find no favour with me, because",41
NA,I believe that the national service training,41
NA,scheme is of great benefit to this country.,41
NA,One does not need to be a 4 f t . 2 in. jack-,41
NA,"booted Prussian to hold these views, and",41
NA,all honorable members have probably had,41
NA,similar experiences of these matters.,41
NA,Many young men wont into national,41
NA,service training camps without a very,41
NA,clear idea of their duty to the country.,41
NA,"Some, perhaps, came from towns, and had",41
NA,"little contact with country boys, and",41
NA,vice versa. Others were born with silver,41
NA,"spoons in their mouths, and had",41
NA,no contact with boys who sold newspapers,41
NA,"on street corners, and so on. The",41
NA,difference in the young men drawn from,41
NA,"various classes, after three months'",41
NA,"national service training, is marvellous.",41
NA,This is a real asset to Australia. The,41
NA,"young men leave the camps, after they",41
NA,have performed a service for their coun-,41
NA,"try, and they feel that they have a greater",41
NA,stake in it. I introduce this matter only,41
NA,to illustrate the point that tbe national,41
NA,"service training scheme, quite apart from",41
NA,the purely military virtues that it pos-,41
NA,sesses of maintaining our army at maxi-,41
NA,"mum strength, has the great virtue also",41
NA,of instilling the spirit of citizenship.,41
NA,"Since the Parliament re-assembled,",41
NA,many honorable members on both sides of,41
NA,tbe chamber have made statements on,41
NA,passive defence. I do not know,41
NA,whether defence is possible against the,41
NA,"atomic bomb, but this I do know, that",41
NA,"London, Coventry, Berlin and other cities",41
NA,which were heavily bombed in World War,41
NA,"II . , stood up to the ordeal because of the",41
NA,inherent discipline of their people. That,41
NA,discipline was born as the result of,41
NA,"military service, or association with mili-",41
NA,"tary service, or a kindred organization.",41
NA,I cannot emphasize too strongly my belief,41
NA,in the extent to which our national,41
NA,character is developed by sacrifices made,41
NA,"by individuals in one or other of tbe forces,",42
NA,"and not necessarily tbe armed forces; but,",42
NA,"unforunately, in these time, tbe armed",42
NA,forces constitute almost the only outlet of,42
NA,activitiy of that kind in which our young,42
NA,people may serve. I shall not proceed,42
NA,with a discussion of those matters.,42
NA,The Governor-General has referred,42
NA,from time to time quite publicly to our,42
NA,"military effort, and not precisely in the",42
NA,same terms as those used in his Speech to,42
NA,"the Parliament on the 4th August, last. I",42
NA,"noticed, on one occasion, that His Excel-",42
NA,"lency said that, so far, we had been just",42
NA,playing with the national service scheme.,42
NA,I think he used that phrase. Whatever,42
NA,our personal opinions may be on this,42
NA,"matter, it must be borne in mind that we",42
NA,have in Sir William Slim a Governor-,42
NA,General who was one of the first captains,42
NA,"of his age. On military matters, be is as",42
NA,good an adviser as any government in,42
NA,tbe world may hope to get at tbe present,42
NA,time. We are indeed fortunate to have,42
NA,him,42
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I rise to order.,42
NA,".[ think that you, Mr Speaker, have ruled",42
NA,in the past that an honorable member,42
NA,may not praise or condemn the Queen's,42
NA,representative. I agree with everything,42
NA,that the honorable member for Henty has,42
NA,said about His Excellency the Governor-,42
NA,General but I point out that i f license is,42
NA,given honorable members to praise His,42
NA,"Excellency, it may also be given to them",42
NA,"to blame him. Therefore, the introduc-",42
NA,tion of His Excellency's name into the,42
NA,debate is a dangerous practice.,42
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The Stand-,42
NA,ing Orders provide that the name of the,42
NA,Governor-General shall not be introduced,42
NA,into a debate.,42
Mr GULLETT ," I am sorry, Mr.",42
NA,Speaker. I shall make no further refer-,42
NA,ence to that matter. I thought that tbe,42
NA,manner of my reference to His Excellency,42
NA,would excuse the lapse.,42
NA,The Prime Minister has spoken of the,42
NA,gravity of the international situation and,42
NA,of the necessity for an increased defence,42
NA,effort. Where is that increased effort to,42
NA,come from? What is the defence effort,42
NA,"based on now? As we all know, the",42
NA,"defence of this country consists, in a sense,",42
NA,of'two parts. We have the hard core of,42
NA,"permanent sailors, soldiers and airmen,",42
NA,"without whom, in peace or war, no organi-",42
NA,"zation of effort is possible. I n addition,",42
NA,"Ave have seen, since the advent of this",42
NA,"Government, the establishment in Aus-",42
NA,tralia of three permanent battalions and,42
NA,at least part of an up-to-date armoured,42
NA,"regiment. Those are great assets, and",42
NA,they provide the hard core around which,42
NA,"everything, in a sense, must be built. But",42
NA,alongside them we have the voluntary,42
NA,forces which are known as the Citizen,42
NA,Military Forces. The members of those,42
NA,forces take charge of the national service,42
NA,trainees after three months' basic,42
NA,training.,42
NA,I do not believe that this country is,42
NA,capable of supporting a large permanent,42
NA,"army, and even i f it were, I do not con-",42
NA,sider tbat we could enlist a large per-,42
NA,manent army. Our army advisers tell,42
NA,us to-day that the number of our per-,42
NA,"manent troops, so far from increasing, is",42
NA,constantly on the decline. The answer to,42
NA,that problem is deep-seated. We may be,42
NA,"described as a martial people, but we are",42
NA,not in any sense a military people. Aus-,42
NA,tralians do not like service in the armed,42
NA,forces merely for the sake of being in,42
NA,"them. I f there is a war, a camp or a",42
NA,"trip of some kind, Australians will be",42
NA,"in it, but they have no desire, in the",42
NA,"main, to serve in the forces in peace-time.",42
NA,"Therefore, I consider that it is futile to",42
NA,speak of the establishment of a large per-,42
NA,"manent armed force, however attractive",42
NA,the idea may be.,42
NA,There is no more comfortable theory,42
NA,than that the defence of the country can,42
NA,"be left to a permanent force of 20,000,",42
NA,"30,000 or even 50,000 men, and the rest",42
NA,of us citizens have no responsibilities,42
NA,other than to pay our taxes. Such a,42
NA,theory will not work in these times unless,42
NA,we are prepared to conscript our citizens,42
NA,for service in the permanent army. I,42
NA,do not think that any one w i l l advocate,42
NA,"such a course. The only way, then, in",42
NA,which we can rapidly increase our effec-,42
NA,tive effort is through the voluntary,42
NA,"system, that is to say, the Citizen Mili-",42
NA,"tary Forces. I n that department, a great",42
NA,deal can be done. From time to time,42
NA,honorable members on this side of the,42
NA,House have risen in their places and,42
NA,recommended to the Government the,42
NA,adoption of certain steps in relation to,43
NA,-the Citizen Military Forces. I firmly,43
NA,believe that if the claim that much more,43
NA,must be done to increase our defence,43
NA,"-effort is sincere, it is time that notice",43
NA,was taken of some of the matters that,43
NA,bave been raised.,43
NA,"At the moment, the voluntary forces",43
NA,are dependent almost entirely on a rela-,43
NA,"tively . small number of men, most of",43
NA,whom served in the last war. I say,43
NA,"most of them served in the last war,",43
NA,"because some young men, who have",43
NA,graduated from the national service,43
NA,"training scheme, are becoming available.",43
NA,They are the ones on whom our hopes for,43
NA,the future must be built. The burden,43
NA,now falls on the officers and non-com-,43
NA,"missioned officers, and it is a great",43
NA,burden. I am sure that the House and,43
NA,the country have not a proper concep-,43
NA,tion of the great sacrifices made by those,43
NA,"men, and the splendid work performed",43
NA,by them in a voluntary capacity. For,43
NA,"their services, they should be suitably",43
NA,"rewarded. Their militia pay, as I havf-.",43
NA,"said repeatedly in the past, should not",43
NA,be subject to tax. One of these men may,43
NA,be in receipt of a wage or salary of £15,43
NA,"-or £20 a week. He may receive, for his",43
NA,"part-time army service, £50 or £'70 per",43
NA,-annuni. The additional money places,43
NA,"him in a higher int-mno bracket, and",43
NA,"when he pays tax, he is not much better",43
NA,off than he would have been i f he had not,43
NA,received payment for his services in the,43
NA,forces. I t must also be remembered that,43
NA,such a service involves a man in certain,43
NA,"-expenditure on uniforms, fares, clothing",43
NA,and the like. There is always a credir.,43
NA,"and debit side, particularly for officer?",43
NA,"and non-commissioned officers, and many",43
NA,-of these men are badly off as the result,43
NA,-of the service that they render to the,43
NA,country. I f anything can be done to,43
NA,"assist this group of men, i t should be done.",43
NA,I t is not good enough to say that con-,43
NA,"sideration will be given to the matter, tbat",43
NA,we shall look into it thoroughly or tbat,43
NA,we shall submit it to the Treasury. The,43
NA,time has come for action.,43
NA,"In the main, the British defence scheme",43
NA,has been built on much the same basis as,43
NA,"-ours, but whereas we have lost almost all",43
NA,-of our volunteers since the introduction,43
NA,"-of compulsory training, the British have",43
NA,-retained theirs. The reason is that they,43
NA,Mr Qullett.,43
NA,have put so much more into their scheme,43
NA,that we have put into ours. They give,43
NA,their young men extra facilities and privi-,43
NA,leges. I hope we shall do the same.,43
Mr BIRD ,Batman) [5.36] -Th e,43
NA,"Speech of the Governor-General, in the",43
NA,"main, is an insipid document, containing",43
NA,a collection of vague platitudes and,43
NA,"generalities. I t is remarkable, not so",43
NA,"much, for its contents as for its omissions.",43
NA,1 propose to deal with a few of the state-,43
NA,"ments in it. Among other things, His",43
NA,Excellency said-,43
NA,"My Governniunt will continue, with other",43
NA,"nations, its practical contribution to the",43
NA,welfare of the South and South-East Asian,43
NA,area through the Colombo Plan. Such,43
NA,measures of help encourage sympathetic under-,43
NA,standing and goodwill.,43
NA,I am a great supporter of the Colombo,43
NA,plan because I believe tbat i f it achieves,43
NA,what its sponsors intended it will have a,43
NA,far-reaching effect on our relations with,43
NA,Asian countries. The Colombo plan was,43
NA,"born early in 1950, because conditions in",43
NA,Asia demanded a new approach to the,43
NA,problems there. The majority of the,43
NA,"600,000,000 people in South-East Asia",43
NA,"were undernourished, tbeir housing facili-",43
NA,"ties were notoriously inadequate, illiteracy",43
NA,"was the lot of 80 per cent, of them, and",43
NA,their expectation of life was less than 30,43
NA,"years. Therefore, the countries of the",43
NA,British Commonwealth in the area got,43
NA,together and decided that they ought to,43
NA,make an endeavour to raise the standards,43
NA,"of living of those people, not only as a",43
NA,"humanitarian action, but also, I suggest",43
NA,"seriously, as a means to counter the spread",43
NA,of communism there. I t can be said,43
NA,"safely tbat, at any rate theoretically,",43
NA,the plan is a co-operative enterprise by,43
NA,which the more highly developed countries,43
NA,of the area will help the less developed,43
NA,countries by giving tbem financial aid and,43
NA,technical assistance. I f one accepts the,43
NA,statements in the Speech of the Governor-,43
NA,"General, it seems tbat the Australian",43
NA,Government is satisfied with the progress,43
NA,of thc plan. But I am by no means satis-,43
NA,fied with it. There are a number of,43
NA,aspects that give no cause for complacency,43
NA,or self-satisfaction.,43
NA,I base my opinion on the second annual,43
NA,report of tbe Consultative Committee of,43
NA,"the Colombo plan, issued in New Delhi",43
NA,in October of last year. Any one who,43
NA,"reads the report, at length, as I have done,",44
NA,will find that i t gives scant satisfaction,44
NA,to ardent supporters of the plan. The,44
NA,contents of the report lead one to believe,44
NA,"that the Colombo plan, which came i n",44
NA,"with a bang, w i l l go out with a whimper.",44
NA,Three and a half years have elapsed since,44
NA,-the foreign ministers of the countries,44
NA,responsible f o r the plan inaugurated what,44
NA,I thought would Ibe a new era of interna-,44
NA,"tional relations, an era that could well",44
NA,alter the destiny of mankind. The min-,44
NA,isters met i n :an atmosphere of apparent,44
NA,urgency and the scheme was initiated and,44
NA,"put under way quickly. Since then, the",44
NA,Consultative Committee has met i n,44
NA,"London, Colombo, Karachi and New",44
NA,Delhi. I understand i t will meet in,44
NA,Ottawa in October of this year. When,44
NA,the Australian representative goes' to,44
NA,"Ottawa, I hope he w i l l not be imbued",44
NA,with the smug satisfaction with which,44
NA,apparently the Government was imbued,44
NA,when i t prepared the Governor-General's,44
NA,Speech. The second annual report of the,44
NA,committee contains a number of disquiet-,44
NA,ing statements about tbe progress of the,44
NA,plan. I t reveals that the difficulties faced,44
NA,by many countries have become formid-,44
NA,"able. I n view of the nature of the report,",44
NA,we have no cause to be jubilant about the,44
NA,progress achieved so f a r . Tbe report,44
NA,states-,44
NA,The Colomho Plan programmes are reaching,44
NA,a crucial stage. The countries of the area,44
NA,have shown their determination to carry them,44
NA,"through, and the decline in export earnings,",44
NA,wliile it has added greatly to the difficulty,44
NA,of the task has made it more than ever neces-,44
NA,sary to press ahead with the developmental,44
NA,programmes . . . The present flow 'of,44
NA,"external financial aid must he continued and,",44
NA,"if possible, increased. The difficulties are",44
NA,indeed formidable.,44
NA,I am concerned about the reaction that,44
NA,difficulties and failures w i l l have on the,44
NA,"minds of the people of Asia, whose friend-",44
NA,ship we are tryin g to w i n through the,44
NA,operation of the plan. Dealing with the,44
NA,national incomes of the less developed,44
NA,"countries of the area, the report states-",44
NA,The fall in export earnings led to a fall,44
NA,in national incomes. This caused rather,44
NA,widespread economic distress and the con-,44
NA,trast with the previous high expectations,44
NA,produced a general feeling of frustration and,44
NA,bewilderment.,44
NA,"To me, those are ominous words. I t",44
NA,appears that the sponsors of the plan are,44
NA,R -[15 ],44
NA,preparing the ground f o r an announce-,44
NA,ment that we have failed to earry out the,44
NA,"original concept. I n 1950, i t was",44
NA,envisaged that assistance would be given,44
NA,to the less developed countries of South,44
NA,and South-East Asia i n the fields of agri-,44
NA,"culture, power and communications. We",44
NA,were told that more land would be placed,44
NA,"under cultivation and irrigation, more",44
NA,food would be produced and power,44
NA,generating capacity would be increased.,44
NA,"The sponsors of the plan realized, as they",44
NA,"stated i n the preamble to i t , that because",44
NA,tbe population of the area was increasing,44
NA,"at the rate of -8,000,000 a year, the pro-",44
NA,gramme envisaged would do little more,44
NA,than maintain existing standards of,44
NA,"living, which were lamentably low. Tbe",44
NA,report of the Consultative Committee,44
NA,"reveals that, although development has",44
NA,"proceeded on those lines, i t has not",44
NA,reached anywhere near the stage contem-,44
NA,plated when the plan was formulated.,44
NA,"According to the report, statistics show",44
NA,"that, althougli there has been some",44
NA,"development i n certain fields, development",44
NA,generally has not reached the stage i t,44
NA,-should have reached after three years of,44
NA,activity. I say incidentally that the,44
NA,-Government has given the Parliament,44
NA,but little opportunity to discuss the plan.,44
NA,Is there any significance i n the improve-,44
NA,ments that have been made? What are,44
NA,-the prospects for the immediate future?,44
NA,Are the living standards of the Asian,44
NA,.peoples being raised enough to compen-,44
NA,"sate f o r increases of population ? I f not,",44
NA,-the plan is not doing what was originally,44
NA,intended. The .report makes no attempt,44
NA,"to answer those questions. I n the main,",44
NA,the committee bas been content to give,44
NA,an account of material achievements. But,44
NA,the report barely touches the vital,44
NA,questions whether those achievements,44
NA,have contributed significantly to an,44
NA,increase of l i v i n g standards or have made,44
NA,further progress possible.,44
NA,I n order to assess the real progress tbat,44
NA,has been achieved and the prospects f or,44
NA,"tlie future, i t is appropriate to examine",44
NA,the salient features of the plan. We were,44
NA,"told that, i n order to provide f o r economic",44
NA,growth and the maintenance of present,44
NA,standards of livin g i n a rapidly increas-,44
NA,"ing population, i t would be necessary to",44
NA,"increase output, and that, i n order to",44
NA,"increase output, i t would be necessary to",44
NA,increase investment. But the nations of,45
NA,"Asia, because of their poverty-stricken",45
NA,"state, were unable to attract capital from",45
NA,overseas until productivity had been,45
NA,"increased. I n other words, their economy",45
NA,needed to be primed to enable them to,45
NA,increase production and then attract,45
NA,capital from other countries. The aid,45
NA,contributed under the Colombo plan was,45
NA,intended to act as a detonator to set this,45
NA,"process in train. Unfortunately, the",45
NA,purpose of the plan has not been achieved,45
NA,because productivity has not been in-,45
NA,creased to any appreciable degree. There,45
NA,has been very little investment of foreign,45
NA,capital in Asia since the plan came into,45
NA,"operation, and it seems to me that, unless",45
NA,the contributing countries are prepared to,45
NA,"increase the scale of their nnanciai aid,",45
NA,the scheme will die on its feet.,45
NA,"Australia, which has acknowledged its",45
NA,obligation to assist in the development,45
NA,"these backward countries, has more reason",45
NA,to fear the failure of the scheme than has,45
NA,any other contributing nation. Our future,45
NA,is irrevocably linked with our relation-,45
NA,"ships with Asian countries, and the col-",45
NA,lapse of the Colombo plan would re-act,45
NA,much more unfavorably upon us than,45
NA,"upon any other country. ""We must in all",45
NA,circumstances try to prevent the disillu-,45
NA,sionment of the peoples of Asia as a,45
NA,result of the failure of the plan. Tbe,45
NA,prosperity of Asia is of the utmost,45
NA,ance to us. It is obvious to me that the,45
NA,volume of aid provided under the scheme,45
NA,has been altogether inadequate. We are,45
NA,spending money hand over fist in other,45
NA,"directions, and we should divert some of",45
NA,that expenditure to the more valuable,45
NA,investment that is represented by our,45
NA,contributions to the Colombo plan. The,45
NA,promotion of goodwill in Asia promotes,45
NA,our own security. If the plan is to,45
NA,"achieve a significant success, it must proprocess",45
NA,duce quick and lasting results. There-,45
NA,"fore, the representatives of the Govern-",45
NA,ment who attend the meeting at Ottawa,45
NA,in October should take the first oppor-,45
NA,tunity to bring to the notice of the,45
NA,consultative committee the obvious flaws,45
NA,that have developed already in the struc-,45
NA,"ture of the plan. These faults, though",45
NA,they were not readily discernible in the,45
NA,"initial stages of the scheme, have assumed",45
NA,immense proportions and now threaten to,45
NA,destroy the efficacy of the whole project.,45
NA,Ur. Bird.,45
NA,Immigration was also mentioned in the,45
NA,Governor-General's Speech. The Govern-,45
NA,ment has announced tbat it is content to,45
NA,continue with its present immigration,45
NA,policy. Most honorable members will,45
NA,"agree, I am sure, that the Department",45
NA,"of Immigration has done good work, but",45
NA,the effectiveness of its programme will be,45
NA,endangered i f it cannot organize a,45
NA,smoother assimilation of immigrants than,45
NA,is possible under tbe present system. Much,45
NA,closer working arrangements between the,45
NA,Commonwealth and the States must be,45
NA,"evolved because, up to the present, there",45
NA,has been constant irritation between State,45
NA,and Commonwealth departments in rela-,45
NA,tion to various aspects of immigration.,45
NA,"I n my opinion, immigration involves",45
NA,much more than the procurement of immi-,45
NA,"grants in othei' countries, tlieir transport",45
NA,"to Australia, and their accommodation",45
NA,of for limited periods in hostels. The arrival,45
NA,of large numbers of new citizens requires,45
NA,a rapid extension of social amenities and,45
NA,"essential services. We need more schools,",45
NA,"hospitals, houses, water, electricity, trans-",45
NA,port and other public services. The obli-,45
NA,gation of supplying tbose services falls at,45
NA,present on State governments. This divi-,45
NA,sion of responsibility is one of the major,45
NA,weaknesses of the immigration scheme.,45
NA,"Und cniably, the major defect of the plan",45
NA,is the lack of effective co-operation be-,45
NA,"importtween the Commonwealth, which orga-",45
NA,"nizes the inflow of immigrants, and the",45
NA,"States, which provide the services needed",45
NA,by the increased population. There,45
NA,appears to be a total lack of appreciation,45
NA,by this Government of the financial strain,45
NA,that this obligation places upon the States.,45
NA,They must have substantial additional,45
NA,financial aid i f immigrants are to be,45
NA,assimilated satisfactorily. I n the early,45
NA,"stages of the immigration programme, the",45
NA,of assimilation was given far less,45
NA,attention than was that of recruiting,45
NA,immigrants overseas. The prime impulse,45
NA,of both the former Government and this,45
NA,Government was to bring as many immi-,45
NA,grants as possible to Australia and make,45
NA,light of the difficulties that would arise,45
NA,from the rapid population increase.,45
NA,Tbe State governments are eager to,45
NA,"establish new arrivals satisfactorily, but",45
NA,they are emphatic that their task cannot,45
NA,be carried out successfully unless this,45
NA,Government acknowledges their need for,46
NA,increased nnanciai aid. They have been,46
NA,called upon to shoulder great responsibili-,46
NA,"ties, and these, unfortunately, have",46
NA,assumed formidable proportions. I am,46
NA,sorry to say that this Government has,46
NA,adopted an airy attitude towards the,46
NA,States. I t seems to imagine that they,46
NA,will be able to muddle through and solve,46
NA,their problems without help.,46
NA,optimism is ill-founded. They cannot.be,46
NA,expected to continue to assume such great,46
NA,liabilities unless provision is made for,46
NA,adequate financial compensation. I know,46
NA,that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr.,46
NA,Holt) met State Ministers at a con-,46
NA,ference on immigration early this year.,46
NA,"However, the discussion at that conference",46
NA,produced a lot of airy platitudes without,46
NA,giving rise to any practical decisions. I t,46
NA,is not enough for the Commonwealth,46
NA,merely to provide hostel accommodation,46
NA,and find opportunities for the employ-,46
NA,ment of new Australians. Its responsi-,46
NA,bility goes much further than that. Tlie,46
NA,plain truth is that the prolonged influx,46
NA,of immigrants has vastly increased the,46
NA,"demand for public services, the cost of",46
NA,providing which should be reckoned as n,46
NA,part of thc cost of a successful immigra-,46
NA,tion scheme. Until the Government,46
NA,acknowledges and accepts its responsibili-,46
NA,"ties in this direction, our immigration",46
NA,programme will not he completely,46
NA,successful.,46
NA,"For reasons of national security, it is",46
NA,essential for Australia to treble its,46
NA,lation within a reasonable space of time.,46
NA,"But, in order to achieve our purpose, we",46
NA,must adjust the machinery of immigra-,46
NA,tion to enable it to cope with the situa-,46
NA,tion. That machinery can easily break,46
NA,down i f the Government fails to realize,46
NA,that its obligations do not cease as soon,46
NA,as immigrants land on Australian soil.,46
NA,"I n fact, at that stage, the Common-",46
NA,wealth's responsibility is not even one-,46
NA,"quarter discharged. Unfortunately, the",46
NA,Government has adopted the attitude tbat,46
NA,its worries end when the immigrants,46
NA,arrive and that the task of arranging for,46
NA,their assimilation should fall upon the,46
NA,"States. However, tbe ^tate governments,",46
NA,because of their limited financial re-,46
NA,sources are unable to do the job,46
NA,adequately.,46
NA,I come now to a consideration of thc,46
NA,process of naturalization. I t is only,46
NA,natural for immigrants to this country to,46
NA,look forward to attaining the status of,46
NA,"Australian citizenship, and the Govern-",46
NA,ment should exert every influence to,46
NA,encourage them to apply for naturaliza-,46
NA,tion as soon as they become eligible,46
NA,"to do so. On the l l t h August,",46
NA,Its I asked the Minister who is. acting for,46
NA,the Minister for Immigration ( Mr.,46
NA,Beale) whether the naturalization,46
NA,figures in relation to non-British immi-,46
NA,grants indicated a reluctance by thosr,46
NA,people to become Australian citizens.,46
NA,"From the Minister's reply, it was evident",46
NA,tbat tens of thousands of immigrants,46
NA,entitled to seek the privilege of Aus-,46
NA,tralian nationality have not done so.,46
NA,"That is a deplorable state of affairs, with",46
NA,"which, according to the Minister, the",46
NA,Government is not satisfied. I consider,46
NA,that we do not fulfil the purpose of,46
NA,bringing people to this coimtry until,46
NA,tbey are naturalized. This matter de-,46
NA,mands urgent consideration.,46
NA,Why are not applications for,46
NA,naturalization being received from immi-,46
NA,grants in greater numbers? We should,46
NA,consider whether the requirements of the,46
NA,law in relation to naturalization are too,46
NA,stringent. Is too high a fee charged ?,46
NA,.Does the nature of the naturalization,46
NA,ceremony act as a deterrent? I n recent,46
NA,years major changes have heen made,46
NA,in order to enhance the dignity,46
NA,of the naturalization ceremony,46
NA,popu- and remove unnecessary deterrents to,46
NA,"naturalization. To-day, although the",46
NA,naturalization ceremony is brighter and,46
NA,more dignified than the former pro-,46
NA,"cedure, the result has not been all that",46
NA,could be desired. I^hoped that the deci-,46
NA,sion of tbe Minister for Immigration,46
NA,( Mr Holt) some time ago to hold future,46
NA,"naturalization ceremonies at town halls,",46
NA,"in a congenial atmosphere, would en-",46
NA,courage large numbers of eligible immi-,46
NA,grants to apply for naturalization. Un-,46
NA,"fortunately, that has not resulted.",46
NA,According to the Minister's reply to my,46
NA,"question, only 1,100 applications wer-3",46
NA,received from non-British immigrants for,46
NA,naturalization in the first six months of,46
NA,"this year. There were 1,770 applications",46
NA,last month. Those figures are relatively,46
NA,"small, compared with the tens of",46
NA,thousands of immigrants who are entitled,47
NA,to seek the status of Australian citizen-,47
NA,ship. A fee of £5 is charged for,47
NA,naturalization papers. I consider thai,47
NA,this deters many immigrants from seek-,47
NA,ing naturalization. No fee was charged,47
NA,for 30 years after federation. There are,47
NA,two points of view about the matter.,47
NA,Some people contend that it is well worth,47
NA,£5 to an immigrant to become an Aus-,47
NA,tralian citizenOthers believe that there,47
NA,can be no correlation of citizenship to,47
NA,money. An immigrant should not be,47
NA,debarred from naturalization only be-,47
NA,cause he is unable to pay this fee.,47
NA,Immigrants who intend to apply for,47
NA,naturalization are required to advertise,47
NA,that fact in two newspapers circulating,47
NA,in the districts in which they live. The,47
NA,object of this legal requirement is to,47
NA,afford to persons who consider thf.,47
NA,"advertiser should not be naturalized, an",47
NA,opportunity to lodge an objection with,47
NA,the Department of Immigration. How-,47
NA,"ever, during the last 36 years fewer than",47
NA,half a dozen such protests hav<j beeu,47
NA,made to the department. Therefore it,47
NA,is obvious that this requirement serves,47
NA,"no worthwhile purpose. I point out that,",47
NA,"frequently, such an advertisement in a",47
NA,newspaper results in the singling out of,47
NA,an alien when he is about to become an,47
NA,Australian citizen. The advertisement,47
NA,pinpoints the fact that he has not already,47
NA,been naturalized. An intending appli-,47
NA,cant for naturalization is required to,47
NA,notify the department of his intention,47
NA,four years before lodging an applica-,47
NA,tion. Why is such lengthy notice re-,47
NA,quired? Our procedure is very complex.,47
NA,"In conclusion, I point out that it is the",47
NA,bounden duty of the Government to use,47
NA,every endeavour to encourage non-,47
NA,British immigrants to become,47
NA,naturalized. The naturalization pro-,47
NA,cedure should be simplified to obviate,47
NA,unnecessary expense to immigrants.,47

NA,In Committee of Supply:,47
Sir ARTHUR FADDEN ,MCPherson-,47
NA,Treasurer) [8.2] - I desire to place,47
NA,before the House to-night estimates of,47
NA,revenue and expenditure for the financial,47
NA,year 1954-55 and to explain the financial,47
NA,proposals which accompany these esti-,47
NA,mates. I desire also to speak briefly on,47
NA,the broad considerations of national policy,47
NA,wbich have guided the Government in,47
NA,framing its budget for this year.,47
NA,THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY.,47
NA,During tbe financial year just closed,47
NA,we had in Australia stability of general,47
NA,"economic conditions, combined in remark-",47
NA,able degree with real and substantial,47
NA,"material progress. On the one hand, re-",47
NA,tail and wholesale prices were generally,47
NA,"steady throughout the year, and so too",47
NA,were wage rates and the other main ele-,47
NA,ments which determine costs. On the,47
NA,"other hand, civilian employment increased",47
NA,"by no less than 90,000 persons. National",47
NA,"income rose by 5 per cent, and, since the",47
NA,"price level did not rise, this was a real",47
NA,gain in terms of goods and services. Total,47
NA,wages and salaries paid increased by,47
NA,"nearly 7 per cent. Total farm income, it",47
NA,"is true, fell by 8 per cent.; but this was a",47
NA,fall from a relatively high level of income,47
NA,in the previous year. There was a rise,47
NA,"of nearly 6 per cent, in business and pro-",47
NA,fessional income. Personal consumption,47
NA,"expenditure was 10 per cent, greater than",47
NA,in 1952-53.,47
NA,Over a wide range of industries levels,47
NA,of production ran high. Output of iron,47
NA,"and steel, coal, copper, and zinc",47
NA,approached or passed previous record,48
NA,figures and the same is. true of many,48
NA,building materials. There was a. notable,48
NA,increase . in the manufacture of such:,48
NA,"diverse articles, as domestic, refrigerators,",48
NA,"rayon fabrics, hosiery and motor bodies.",48
NA,Generation of electricity rose above its,48
NA,previous highest point.,48
NA,The volume of retail trade increased,48
NA,considerably and that increase was,48
NA,shared by most branches of business. I n,48
NA,"particular, sales of motor cars and house-",48
NA,hold appliances showed an almost spec-,48
NA,tacular growth. Although there was a,48
NA,"large increase in supplies, obtained from",48
NA,"both local production and imports, tbere",48
NA,d'oes not seem to have been any excessive,48
NA,building-up of stocks.,48
NA,The value of imports for the year was,48
NA,"£682,000,000'. That was £171,000,000",48
NA,greater than the value of imports in the,48
NA,previous year. Exports for 1953-54,48
NA,"amounted to £816,000,000 and although",48
NA,"this was £30,000,000 less than exports in",48
NA,1952-53 is was still a relatively high,48
NA,figure. I t has in fact been exceeded in,48
NA,only two other years.,48
NA,During. 1953-54 the Government made,48
NA,further relaxations of import controls,48
NA,and imports are now running at a com-,48
NA,paratively high level. Until the wool-,48
NA,selling season opens it will not be possible,48
NA,to gauge with any confidence wbat export,48
NA,prospects for the year are likely to be. I t,48
NA,is reasonable to expect some net capital,48
NA,inflow during the year but it is not,48
NA,"possible, at. this, stage to estimate the",48
NA,importance of this factor.,48
NA,At the peak of the last export season,48
NA,our international reserves reached,48
NA,"£620,000,000. After that there was a",48
NA,"moderate' decline and at 30th June last,",48
NA,"the reserves stood at £571,000,000, which",48
NA,"represented a net addition of £10,000,000",48
NA,during the year.,48
NA,Altogether 1953-54 was a period of,48
NA,stable; genuine and widely-spread pros-,48
NA,perity. Perhaps never before in our,48
NA,history have we had a year to equal it.,48
NA,As weturn to prospects' for the coming,48
NA,year' it is natural to ask whether we can-,48
NA,"not do as well again, whether we cannot",48
NA,again enjoy balanced and stable economic,48
NA,conditions and yet make at least as great,48
NA,an advance in national development.,48
NA,Cannot these two great objectives of policy,48
NA,again be combined?,48
NA,Conditions necessarily differ from year,48
NA,to year; and last year conditions,48
NA,"happened to be, on the whole, favorable",48
NA,to us. Despite the decline in the United,48
NA,"States, it remained' a fairly prosperous",48
NA,"year foi"" the world at large and our",48
NA,overseas trading position continued rela-,48
NA,"tively strong. Internally, we had largely",48
NA,recovered from tbe setback of 1952-53,48
NA,"even before the year began, and although",48
NA,there was then a small amount of unem-,48
NA,"ployment and some idle plant, those",48
NA,resources were soon absorbed into produc-,48
NA,tion and the whole economy ran along,48
NA,smoothly at or very near full employment.,48
NA,I venture to say that the key to our,48
NA,success in 1953-54 lies in just that fact.,48
NA,We were able to bring all our physical,48
NA,"resources into employment and yet, for",48
NA,"the greater part of the year at any rate,",48
NA,we did not over-strain them. Whilst,48
NA,industrial activity grew and a good rate,48
NA,of development was maintained there,48
NA,"was, for the most part, enough labour and",48
NA,materials and enough power and other,48
NA,facilities to meet requirements. That is,48
NA,the chief lesson of 1953-54. I t is indeed,48
NA,the chief lesson of the whole post-war,48
NA,period. I f we keep a balance between,48
NA,available resources and the demand for,48
NA,tbose resources we will generally have not,48
NA,only stability of prices and costs but,48
NA,"rising output, improving efficiency and",48
NA,sound progress in development. Allow,48
NA,demand for resources to outrun supply,48
NA,and we will almost certainly have disloca-,48
NA,"tion, waste and a cutting-back of real",48
NA,output and the rate of development. We,48
NA,had a grim experience of those things in,48
NA,the period up to 1952 and I should not,48
NA,need to recall them here.,48
NA,We should not need to be taught that,48
NA,"lesson again, learnt as i t was in years of",48
NA,"disruption and futility ; and, as things",48
NA,"are, i t is, I believe, a lesson that should be",48
NA,very aetive in our minds. We have,48
NA,"tasted the fruits of stable progress and,",48
NA,"rightly, for our own sakes. we want it. to",48
NA,"go on.. We have, nationally, a tremen-",48
NA,dous task to people and develop this con-,48
NA,"tinent; but we can only hope to perform,",48
NA,that task if we go about i t in an orderly,48
NA,"and: effective way.. We have ahead of us,,",48
NA,as the Prime Minister ( Mr Menzies) has,49
NA,"related to the House, tlie prospect of",49
NA,major political and strategic commit-,49
NA,"ments abroad, commitments whicli may",49
NA,call for much greater defence efforts and,49
NA,"preparations. This last consideration is,",49
NA,"perhaps, the strongest and most insistent",49
NA,reason of all why we must seek to combine,49
NA,the maximum employment of our resources,49
NA,with a balanced and effective distribution,49
NA,of those resources.,49
NA,"Good though recent times have been,",49
NA,there can be no mistaking the signs that,49
NA,stresses are again threatening to develop,49
NA,our economy. During recent months short-,49
NA,"ages of labour have increased, particularly",49
NA,"in the basic industries, such as iron and",49
NA,"steel and building, and in the basic ser-",49
NA,"vices, such as railways. Some supplies",49
NA,"have also become scarce, amongst them",49
NA,steel and certain building materials.,49
NA,"Meanwhile, numerous industries and",49
NA,"public undertakings, not actually short of",49
NA,labour and materials for current pur-,49
NA,"poses, have been strenuously trying to",49
NA,get more of both in order to expand their,49
NA,"activities. Again, demand for consump-",49
NA,tion goods is still tending to increase; as,49
NA,"it does so, it provides a stimulus for still",49
NA,further industrial expansion and still,49
NA,further demands for resources. There is,49
NA,a degree of unhealthy financial specula-,49
NA,"tion going on, though so far it is limited",49
NA,mainly to certain sections of the market.,49
NA,I do not want to exaggerate the portents,49
NA,as seen at this time. The current short-,49
NA,ages of labour and materials are not to,49
NA,be compared with the bottlenecks which,49
NA,had such a crippling effect on our economy,49
NA,in the period before 1952. There is no,49
NA,longer any coal shortage. Power supplies,49
NA,appear adequate for the time being and,49
NA,more capacity is rapidly being built.,49
NA,There has been a fairly general improve-,49
NA,ment during the past three years in the,49
NA,basic facilities available to us and this,49
NA,should stand us in good stead in the,49
NA,future.,49
NA,Nor would I exclude altogether tbe,49
NA,"possibility of changes, in some directions",49
NA,during the year which may run counter to,49
NA,the present general trend towards expan-,49
NA,"sion of demand. Eor example, whilst",49
NA,export prospects on the whole may be,49
NA,"reasonably good, it is possible that total",49
NA,export earnings this year will be appre-,49
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,49
NA,ciably less than last year. I f this proves,49
NA,to be so it could have some offsetting,49
NA,effect on internal demand and business,49
NA,activity.,49
NA,"Nevertheless, the most significant fact",49
NA,at the present time is that pressure upon,49
NA,resources has again appeared in our,49
NA,economy and on present indications seems,49
NA,likely to grow. We will obtain some addi-,49
NA,"tional labour as the year goes on, partly",49
NA,from local sources and partly from immi-,49
NA,"gration, and there should be some increase",49
NA,in the supply of goods from local output,49
NA,"and from imports. I f , however, the",49
NA,"in present general quest for labour continues,",49
NA,"and i f demand for goods keeps rising,",49
NA,these additional resources may well be,49
NA,"swallowed up, leaving demands still un-",49
NA,satisfied. Labour will tend to shift away,49
NA,from the basic industries and key mate-,49
NA,rials will become scarcer. The defence,49
NA,effort and developmental projects will be,49
NA,retarded and industrial productivity will,49
NA,"fall. All tbis could happen even though,",49
NA,"on the face of things, the economy might",49
NA,appear active and business thriving. Such,49
NA,a situation would clearly not be avoided,49
NA,by indiscriminate mass immigration;,49
NA,recent experience has taught us that the,49
NA,immediate effect of large-scale immigra-,49
NA,tion is to add at least as much to the,49
NA,demand for labour as i t does to the supply,49
NA,of labour.,49
NA,Were inflationary conditions to return,49
NA,we could expect at a fairly early stage the,49
NA,beginning of a new upward thrust of,49
NA,"prices and costs. That, I suggest, is",49
NA,about the last thing any of us wishes to,49
NA,see. During the inflation years our,49
NA,general level of costs was raised inordin-,49
NA,ately high-fa r too high for a country,49
NA,"like ours which, on the one hand, depends",49
NA,upon selling so much of its products in,49
NA,"markets abroad and which, on the other",49
NA,"hand, has been rapidly establishing new",49
NA,industries to compete in our own markets,49
NA,with the products of other countries.,49
NA,"Furthermore, the success or failure of",49
NA,some of the greatest developmental pro-,49
NA,jects now being undertaken in Australia,49
NA,"-th e Snowy Mountains scheme, for",49
NA,example - depend fundamentally upon,49
NA,"one question, the question whether costs",49
NA,can be kept at economic levels.,49
NA,The first thing to do about the problem,49
NA,"of costs is, obviously, to ensure that costs",49
NA,rise no higher. I f the general forces,49
NA,"whicli influence costs can be kept stable,",50
NA,then the particular factors which,50
NA,normally work towards the reduction of,50
NA,costs will have a chance to operate. I t,50
NA,is through these factors that higher,50
NA,national productivity will be achieved-,50
NA,and the obverse of higher productivity is,50
NA,"lower cost levels. Those factors, however,",50
NA,thrive and find play only in the conditions,50
NA,"of a stable and balanced.economy. ""We",50
NA,have had these conditions for the past,50
NA,"year or so and, unquestionably for that",50
NA,"reason, there are signs that some ground",50
NA,has been won in the attack on costs. Not,50
NA,a few industries have been able to report,50
NA,increasing output from the capital and,50
NA,labour they employ. Such promising,50
NA,"tendencies will, however, quickly be over-",50
NA,borne i f a scramble for resources gets,50
NA,"under way again, i f business goes out to",50
NA,chase the ephemeral profits of inflation,50
NA,rather than the profits of efficiency and,50
NA,if labour falls again for the delusion of,50
NA,"so-called "" attraction "" wage rates.",50
NA,To say this is to say again-i t cannot,50
NA,be too often repeated-tha t the cost,50
NA,problem is the responsibility of every one.,50
NA,Governments and other public authorities,50
NA,liave an important share in that responsi-,50
NA,bility. I t is for them to lighten taxes,50
NA,"charges, to avoid undue competition for",50
NA,resources and to use their powers and,50
NA,conduct their operations in a way that,50
NA,will promote a state of economic balance.,50
NA,But i t is labouring the obvious to say,50
NA,that industry and trade and those who,50
NA,work and share in them also have,50
NA,"responsibility as great as, i f not greater",50
NA,"than, that of governments.",50
NA,FINANCIAL POLICY.,50
NA,Such broadly is the context within,50
NA,which the budget for the current year has,50
NA,been prepared. The Government has had,50
NA,to weigh carefully the various elements,50
NA,in this rather complex situation. I t has,50
NA,had to consider wbere and how far,50
NA,restraint should be exercised and where,50
NA,and bow far encouragement should be,50
NA,given. The problem has been by no means,50
NA,exclusively an economic and financial one.,50
NA,We have had very much in our minds tbe,50
NA,international prospect- a prospect whieh,50
NA,"plainly decrees that we should, as far as",50
NA,"possible, husband our strength, financially",50
NA,"and otherwise, against the burdens and",50
NA,stresses which may well lie just ahead of,50
NA,us.,50
NA,On the expenditure side the right policy,50
NA,must obviously be one of firm control.,50
NA,That some branches of expenditure should,50
NA,"increase is, under present circumstances,",50
NA,inevitable. Defence and social services,50
NA,"are examples. Where, again, works",50
NA,projects subject to contracts are making,50
NA,"headway, additional provision for ex-",50
NA,penditure cannot be avoided. Subject to,50
NA,"considerations like these, however, it",50
NA,"would be wrong, at a time when com-",50
NA,"munity spending as a whole is on the rise,",50
NA,to make large additions to public expendi-,50
NA,ture. One of the most important factors,50
NA,making for general stability in the past,50
NA,two years bas been the overall restraint,50
NA,iipon governmental spending. This is,50
NA,certainly no time to abandon that,50
NA,restraint.,50
NA,On the revenue side the Government is,50
NA,in a position to make further tax reduc-,50
NA,tions as it foreshadowed in the Prime,50
NA,Minister's policy speech. I t proposes to,50
NA,reduce taxes up to the limit of budget,50
NA,capacity after niaking provision for essen-,50
NA,tial expenditure and having regard to the,50
NA,and commitments Australia may soon have to,50
NA,face: and it has devised the tax reduc-,50
NA,tions in a way that will ensure the maxi-,50
NA,mum incentive to effort while making,50
NA,wherever possible a direct reduction in,50
NA,costs. At the same time i t has taken care,50
NA,to ensure that the budget for the year,50
NA,will balance; for there could be no,50
NA,thought at a time like this of adding to,50
NA,the volume of spending power by the,50
NA,process of deficit-financing.,50
NA,This year the Government has given no,50
NA,undertaking to assist Loan Council bor-,50
NA,rowing programmes from revenue as it,50
NA,had to do on a large scale in the last three,50
NA,"years, when public loan raisings fell far",50
NA,"short of borrowing requirements. Since,",50
NA,"however, the Commonwealth has agreed",50
NA,with the States that the full amount of,50
NA,"loan money raised this year, either from",50
NA,"local or overseas sources, will be applied",50
NA,"towards the Loan Council programmes,",50
NA,"the whole of its own expenditures, includ-",50
NA,"ing capital expenditures, will have to be",50
NA,met from its own resources. This is not,50
NA,something we are doing willingly. We,50
NA,would in fact be very glad to finance a,50
NA,"large part, i f not the whole, of our",51
NA,capital works from loan moneys. .But,51
NA,since sufficient loan money is not yet,51
NA,available for all the capital requirements,51

NA,The property limit will be raised to,51

NA,The tax reimbursement grant payable,52
NA,to the .States under the formula laid,52
NA,down in existing legislation is estimated,52
NA,"at £130,500,000. Because this would",52

NA,Last year expenditure on this item was,53

NA,to provide for additional expenditure,53
NA,under the Colombo plan.,53
NA,Total Expenditure.,53
NA,"I n total, expenditure in 1954-55 is",53
NA,"estimated at £1,014,849,000 compared",53
NA,"with actual expenditure of £960,428,000",53
NA,in 1953-54. Details of actual revenue,53
NA,and expenditure last year are given in,53
NA,"Statement No. 1 attached to this speech,",53
NA,while details of the expenditure estimates,53
NA,for 1954-55 are given in Statement No. 4.,53
NA,"REVENUE ESTIMATES, 1954-55.",53
NA,On the basis of present rates of taxa-,53
NA,"tion, it is estimated that total revenue",53
NA,"in 1954-55 would reach £1,050,100,000.",53
NA,This includes revenue from taxation,53
NA,"£936,856,000, and other revenue",53
NA,"£113,244,000, ancl is approximately",53
NA,"£33,000,000 greater than actual revenue",53
NA,in 1953-54.,53
NA,Although incomes of both individuals,53
NA,and companies upon which income tax,53
NA,is currently being assessed were larger,53
NA,"last year than in the year before, and",53
NA,"although wages and salary payments,",53
NA,imports and sales can be expected to,53
NA,"increase again this year, it has to be",53
NA,remembered that revenue in 1954-55 will,53
NA,bear a full year's cost of the largo and,53
NA,comprehensive tax reductions made in,53
NA,the 1953-54 budget. That full year cost,53
NA,"was estimated at £118,000,000 on the",53
NA,basis of conditions at the time. I t would,53
NA,be substantially greater on the basis of,53
NA,current conditions and prospects. The,53
NA,revenue estimates for 1954-55 are set out,53
NA,and explained in detail in Statement No.,53
NA,3 attached to this speech.,53
NA,If revenue were to stand at,53
NA,"£1.050,100,000 and p-nenditure",53
NA,"£l,'014j849j000 there would be a budget",53
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,53
NA,"surplus of £35,251,000. The Government",53
NA,proposes to make tax reductions worth,53
NA,"£46.600,000 a year to taxpayers, and it",53
NA,is estimated that tbe cost of these tax,53
NA,"reductions in 1954-55 will, be £35,000,000.",53
NA,TAXATION PROPOSALS.,53
NA,Having this amount of scope for tax,53
NA,"reductions, the Government has con-",53
NA,sidered very carefully the form such,53
NA,reductions could most appropriately take,53
NA,under present circumstances. I t has,53
NA,"decided that, as iu last year's budget,",53
NA,the greatest weight should be given to,53
NA,reductions of income tax on individuals.,53
NA,"By so doing, the benefits will be spread",53
NA,most widely and the greatest number of,53
NA,people will receive a further incentive to,53
NA,work and to save.,53
NA,"The Government has, however,",53
NA,explored the possibilities of reducing,53
NA,indirect taxation and it is proposing some,53
NA,very useful reductions in that field. Some,53
NA,of tliese reductions will make an,53
NA,important direct contribution to the,53
NA,"problem of reducing costs. Others, again,",53
NA,will be very helpful to the householder,53
NA,and the familv man. The Government,53
NA,has also examined at great length the,53
NA,"vexed question of depreciation allowances,",53
NA,and I shall have something to say on,53
NA,that important subject presently.,53
NA,"Meanwhile, I wish to give the main",53
NA,details of our tax proposals.,53
NA,INCOME TAX AND SOCIAL SERVICES,53
NA,CONTRIBUTION.,53
NA,Bates of Tax: Individuals.,53
NA,I t is proposed to reduce the rates of,53
NA,individual income tax and social services,53
NA,"contribution as from, the 1st July, 1954.",53
NA,The reduction will bu graduated over all,53
NA,income ranges and will represent an,53
NA,"overall decrease of 9 per cent, on existing",53
NA,rates. Statement No. 6 illustrates the,53
NA,reductions for taxpayers at selected income,53
NA,levels and with various family respon-,53
NA,sibilities. The reductions in tax range,53
NA,"from approximately 20 per cent, on the",53
NA,"lower incomes to about 8 per cent, for",53
NA,"taxpayers with incomes between £8,000",53
NA,"and £16,000. On the excess of income",53
NA,"over £16,000 the new rates scale will",53
NA,terminate at a maximum rate of 13s. 4d.,53
NA,in the £1 instead of the present 14s.,53
NA,at The rates of instalment deductions will,53
NA,"be reduced as from the 1st October, 1954,",53
NA,"which, is the earliest date by which it will",54
NA,be possible to prepare and distribute the,54
NA,new instalment schedules. I n the case of,54
NA,taxpayers who are subject to provisional,54
NA,"tax, the reductions will be reflected in",54
NA,decreased amounts of provisional tax for,54
NA,1954-55.,54
NA,The reductions in the individual rates,54
NA,"will cost revenue £31,250,000 in a full",54
NA,"year and £23,200,000 in the current year.",54
NA,Successive tax reductions effected by,54
NA,this Government have very substantially,54
NA,reduced the burden of income tax on all,54
NA,classes of taxpayers. I t is significant that,54
NA,tho new rates represent an overall reduc-,54
NA,"tion of almost 30 per cent, on the rates",54
NA,in force when the Government came into,54
NA,office. Statement No. 7 compares income,54
NA,"tax in Australia, TJnited Kingdom and",54
NA,New Zealand and shows that income,54
NA,taxpayers in Australia are paying con-,54
NA,siderably less than those in the other two,54
NA,countries.,54
NA,I t is proposed to allow deductions of,54
NA,gifts of £1 or more to the Australian,54
NA,"Elizabethan Theatre Trust, the Australian",54
NA,Academy of Science and to public funds,54
NA,"for tbe acquisition, construction and",54
NA,maintenance of school and college build-,54
NA,ings used by non-profit organizations.,54
NA,These concessions will cost revenue about,54
NA,"£200,000 in a full year, but there will be",54
NA,no cost in 1954-55.,54
NA,Mining.,54
NA,"Amounts received for the grant, assignincome",54
NA,"ment or surrender of mining leases are,",54
NA,"at present, assessable income of",54
NA,recipients and deductible in the assessdeceased,54
NA,ments of tbe payers. Assessability of the,54
NA,"amounts received has, i t is thought, proved",54
NA,a deterrent in some cases to mining,54
NA,"development. I t is proposed, accordingly,",54
NA,to place these transactions outside the,54
NA,income tax field unless the parties to a,54
NA,transaction agree that such payments,54
NA,should continue to be assessable,54
NA,one hand and deductible on tbe other.,54
NA,"Under the existing legislation, income",54
NA,is exempt from tax i f it is derived by a,54
NA,bona fide prospector from the sale of,54
NA,rights to mine for gold and certain other,54
NA,metals and minerals which are prescribed,54
NA,by regulation. This exemption applies,54
NA,to a company which has itself carried,54
NA,out the major part of the field work,54
NA,"prospecting, but it does not extend to",54
NA,dividends paid by the company out of the,54
NA,"exempt income. I t is proposed that,",54
NA,where dividends are paid wholly and ex-,54
NA,"clusively out of the exempt income, the",54
NA,shareholders shall be free from income,54
NA,tax on those dividends.,54
NA,I t is further proposed to extend the,54
NA,list of metals and minerals prescribed for,54
NA,the purpose of tbe foregoing exemption.,54
NA,I t is estimated that the cost in a full,54
NA,"year will be £15,000. There will be no",54
NA,cost to revenue in 1954-55.,54
NA,Purchased Annuities.,54
NA,"At present, an annual allowance is",54
NA,"made, in the annuitant's assessment, for",54
NA,the purchase price paid by him for an,54
NA,"annuity for life, but this allowance ceases",54
NA,when he has attained his expectation of,54
NA,life as actuarially calculated. The loss of,54
NA,this allowance increases the tax payable,54
NA,by the annuitant at a time when he may,54
NA,Oifts. be least able to bear an increased tax,54
NA,burden. I t is proposed to remove this,54
NA,limitation so that the annuitant will be,54
NA,entitled to the allowance throughout his,54
NA,lifetime.,54
NA,The cost in a full year will be about,54
NA,"£15,000. I n this year there will be no",54
NA,cost to revenue.,54
NA,United Kingdom War Pensions.,54
NA,"At present, United Kingdom pensions",54
NA,payable to disabled servicemen resident in,54
NA,Australia are exempt from Australian,54
NA,tax. I t is proposed to extend this,54
NA,"exemption, as from the 1st July, 1954, to",54
NA,the the widows and other dependants of,54
NA,United Kindom servicemen.,54
NA,The exemption will then be in conformity,54
NA,with the exemption of pensions paid by,54
NA,the Commonwealth to widows and other,54
NA,dependants of Australian servicemen.,54
NA,I n a full year there will be a cost to,54
NA,"revenue of about £20,000 but no cost in",54
NA,on the this financial year.,54
NA,Sales Tax.,54
NA,The rate of tax on furniture and certain,54
NA,"household equipment, including crockery,",54
NA,"cutlery, floor coverings and household",54
NA,"appliances, will be reduced from 12^ per",54
NA,"cent, to 10 per cent. This reduction,",54
NA,"which is expected to cost £4,376,000 in a",54
NA,"of full year and £3,400,000 in the current",54
NA,"year, should be particularly useful to",55
NA,people setting up homes.,55
NA,I t is also proposed to reduce from 16f,55
NA,"per cent, to 12-J per eent. the rate of",55
NA,"tax on toys, fireworks, amusement equip-",55
NA,"ment, musical instruments, confectionery",55
NA,and ice-cream. These reductions are ex-,55
NA,"pected to cost £1,714,000 in a full year and",55
NA,"£1,333,<0OO i n 1954-'5'5.",55
NA,A number of important items will be,55
NA,wholly exempted from sales tax. Amongst,55
NA,these items are several which have a direct,55
NA,bearing on the costs of industry or con-,55
NA,structional work.,55
NA,"Eor example, hand tools, are to be",55
NA,"exempted at a cost to revenue of £2,530,000",55
NA,"in a full year and £1,800,000 in the",55
NA,current year.,55
NA,Certain types of industrial machinery,55
NA,"and equipment are also to be exempted,",55
NA,amongst them being machinery for the,55
NA,r pair and maintenance of manufacturing,55
NA,"plant, repair plant used in the mining",55
NA,"industry, machinery for use by contrac-",55
NA,tors engaged in building and the construc-,55
NA,"tion of roads, dams and similar works.",55
NA,The cost of revenue of exempting this,55
NA,"group is expected to be £1,210,000 in a",55
NA,"full year and £9,00,000 in the current",55
NA,year.,55
NA,Aircraft and aircraft parts will be,55
NA,"exempted at a cost to revenue of £869,000",55
NA,"in a full year and '£800,000 in the current",55
NA,year.,55
NA,"Paper bags, wrapping paper and string",55
NA,"will be exempted at a cost of £1,800,000",55
NA,"in ,a full year and £1,400,000 in 1954-55.",55
NA,Exemption is also proposed for 'bottles,55
NA,"and cases used in the soft drink industry,",55
NA,for clock systems and time recorders for,55
NA,business and industrial use 'and for a,55
NA,number of miscellaneous items which at,55
NA,present constitute anomalies i n the,55
NA,administration of sales tax. The cost to,55
NA,revenue of these exemption's is estimated,55
NA,"at £3.23,000 in :a full year and ,£259,000 in",55
NA,the current year.,55
NA,All told the sales tax concessions I have,55
NA,just outlined are expected to have a value,55
NA,"to taxpayers of £12,822,000 in a full year",55
NA,"and £9,892,000 in 1954-55. Pull details",55
NA,of these proposals will be given when,55
NA,amending legislation is brought down,55
NA,later this evening .and tbe amendments,55
NA,will become effective as from the start of,55
NA,business to-morrow.,55
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,55
NA,Pay-roll Tax.,55
NA,I t is proposed to raise the annual,55
NA,"exemption from £4,160 to £6,240. On",55
NA,"sales a weekly basis, this is an increase from",55
NA,£80 per week to £120 per week. The,55
NA,higher exemption will operate in respect,55
NA,of wages payable on or after the 1st,55
NA,"September, 1954.' Tax will be payable",55
NA,Only on the excess of wages over the,55
NA,amount of £120 per week. This amend-,55
NA,ment will exempt a further l'O^OO,55
NA,employers from pay-roll tax and reduce,55
NA,the amount of tax payable by those still,55
NA,subject to this tax.,55
NA,I t is .also proposed to exempt wages,55
NA,"paid by non-profit private hospitals, thus",55
NA,bringing tbe pay-roll tax law into line,55
NA,"with the income tax and sales tax laws,",55
NA,which already allow concessions to such,55
NA,"hospitals. Up to the present, the pay-roll",55
NA,tax exemption in respect of hospitals has,55
NA,been limited to public hospitals.,55
NA,The loss of revenue resulting from,55
NA,"these concessions will be £1,810,000 in a",55
NA,"full year and £1,508,000 in 1954-55.",55

NA,f,56
NA,"As I liave already said, the Governmeut",56
NA,has considered very closely the question,56
NA,of income tax allowances i n respect of,56
NA,depreciation. The subject has been widely,56
NA,discussed publicly and we have had many,56
NA,representations on i t f r o m various sections,56
NA,"3,400,000 of industry. We have also obtained a",56
NA,wealth of expert advice and we have,56
NA,examined the measures taken i n a number,56
NA,of other countries. I could not hope to,56
NA,discuss the subject i n all its ramifications,56
NA,"225,000 here, but there are a few relevant con-",56
NA,siderations which I think should be stated,56
NA,at this point.,56
NA,"There is, without doubt, an extra-",56
NA,"52,000",56
NA,ordinary range and diversity of opinion,56
NA,on this issue. Much of the diversity seems,56
NA,to spring from the fact that people who,56
NA,put particular proposals forward have,56
NA,"800,000 different objects i n view. Some, for",56
NA,"example, are concerned with the problem",56
NA,"of wbat has come to be called "" capital",56
NA,"250,000 erosion"" which arises when, as a result",56
NA,of the increase i n costs during a period,56
NA,"1,800,000 of inflation, the replacement of plant",56
NA,requires a capital expenditure much,56
NA,higher than the original cost of the plant.,56
NA,Others are concerned not so mucli with,56
NA,"900,000",56
NA,the problem of financing the replacement,56
NA,of bid plant as w i th the active stimula-,56
NA,800.000 tion of investment i n new plant in exist-,56
NA,ing and i n entirely new enterprises.,56
NA,"Others, again, direct their minds to the",56
NA,"1,400,000 replacement of plant i n the future, this",56
NA,with a view to promoting .a more rapid,56
NA,"259,000 scrapping of plant, whether already in-",56
NA,stalled or to be installed i n tbe future.,56
NA,"9,892,000 Many of the proposals tbat have been",56
NA,put forward contemplate adjustments of,56
NA,the depreciation provisions of the income,56
NA,"tax laws which, while leaving taxpayers",56
NA,liable eventually to more or less the same,56
NA,"1,508,000 amount of taxation, would permit them to",56
NA,re-arrange tlieir capital programmes so,56
NA,as to ease their particular problems of,56
NA,financing plant -installation or replace-,56
NA,"ment. Other proposals, however, go",56
NA,".400,000",56
NA,"beyond this and suggest what, i n fact, i f",56
NA,"not i n form , would be a subsidy ( i n the",56
NA,shape of tax remissions) to purchasers,56
NA,"of new plant, this at the expense of",56
NA,"35,000,000",56
NA,revenue.,56
NA,Of this type are proposals based on the,57
NA,system of investment allo-wances recently,57
NA,adopted in tbe TJnited Kingdom. The Go-,57
NA,vernment has given particular attention,57
NA,to these proposals which have a number,57
NA,"of advocatesin Australia, and has found",57
NA,that they have features which are not,57
NA,acceptable under our conditions. I n thc,57
NA,"-first place, such allowances would apply",57
NA,only to new plant and would therefore be,57
NA,of no benefit to firms which have already,57
NA,set up their establishments and are net,57
NA,"likely to extend them. Secondly, while",57
NA,an attempt might be made to confine such,57
NA,a. subsidy to certain types of capital,57
NA,"assets or certain sectors of industry, in",57
NA,practice this would prove so difficult as,57
NA,to be well-nigh impossible. The result,57
NA,in that case would be to give an indis-,57
NA,criminate stimulus to all types of new-,57
NA,capital investment and tbe cost to revenue,57
NA,would become extremely high. Eor these,57
NA,and other reasons the Government cannot,57
NA,accept proposals of this type.,57
NA,Another proposal which has had many,57
NA,-thoug h a decreasing number of-ad -,57
NA,vocates is the special initial depreciation,57
NA,"allowance, of which we had experience in",57
NA,earlier post-war years. The particular,57
NA,feature of this method is that it produces,57
NA,ti large tax saving to the taxpayer in the,57
NA,"first year after new plant is acquired, and",57
NA,therefore it too gives a strong but indis-,57
NA,criminate stimulus to new investment.,57
NA,I t was largely for this reason that the,57
NA,system was abandoned under the infla-,57
NA,tionary conditions of 1951. With pres-,57
NA,sure upon resources again developing in,57
NA,"our economy, this would hardly be an",57
NA,opportune time to restore that system,57
NA,even i f it were acceptable on other,57
NA,grounds. In. any case it has proved i n,57
NA,"practice, both here and elsewhere, to",57
NA,have other defects as a. normal feature of,57
NA,an. income tax system.,57
NA,I have cited investment allowances and,57
NA,special initial depreciation allowances as,57
NA,particular proposals which have been,57
NA,prominent in recent discussions. I cannot,57
NA,here review the many other schemes which,57
NA,"liave been brought under notice, but I",57
NA,do wish to make a comment on the exist-,57
NA,ing depreciation provisions of the taxa-,57
NA,tion law.,57
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,57
NA,In the opinion of some authorities these,57
NA,provisions contain certain defects and,57
NA,"anomalies, although it is conceded that",57
NA,generally they provide a basis upon Avhich,57
NA,a reasonably satisfactory system of depre-,57
NA,ciation allowances can be built. These,57
NA,"authorities at least believe that, insofar",57
NA,as the end sought should be provision for,57
NA,a more rapid writing-off of plant on,57
NA,account of obsolescence or for other,57
NA,"reasons, the existing provisions could be",57
NA,used and adapted satisfactorily.,57
NA,I t does not seem to be appreciated as,57
NA,"widely as it might, even by the more sober",57
NA,"opinion to wbich I have just referred,",57
NA,that although'the present rates of depre-,57
NA,ciation provided in the act are based on,57
NA,what is called the effective life of an,57
NA,"asset, it is nevertheless possible for the",57
NA,owner of the asset to scrap it at an earlier,57
NA,date and then claim the amount by,57
NA,which the realization price falls short of,57
NA,the written-down value as a deduction,57
NA,for income tax purposes.,57
NA,Notwithstanding this little-understood,57
NA,"provision of the existing law, criticism",57
NA,seems to concentrate mainly on the rates,57
NA,of depreciation allowed for various types,57
NA,of assets. Without saying whether such,57
NA,"criticism is justified or not, I think this",57
NA,is a matter upon which the public mind,57
NA,ought to be set at ease and with this in,57
NA,view the Government has decided to refer,57
NA,this aspect of the matter to a special,57
NA,committee for independent inquiry and,57
NA,report. I t seems to us that such an,57
NA,inquiry is a necessary first step i f we are,57
NA,to consider this question from the point,57
NA,of view of national interest. To accept,57
NA,blindly the pleas of sectional advocates,57
NA,in such a highly technical field would,57
NA,"endanger that high purpose, and this",57
NA,Government will be no party to it.,57
NA,The Government has decided that a,57
NA,parliamentarian should be chairman of the,57
NA,committee and it has chosen Mr Alan,57
NA,"Hulme, the honorable member for Petrie,",57
NA,to undertake that assignment. Four other,57
NA,members will be chosen from men actively,57
NA,"engaged respectively in manufacturing,'",57
NA,"commerce, primary industry and the",57
NA,accountancy profession.,57

NA,CONCLUSION.,58
NA,"1,050,100,000 I n surveying tbe outlook, the Govern-",58
NA,ment has found some grounds for caution,58
NA,and some reason to stress the approach of,58
NA,weightier national responsibilities for Aus-,58
NA,"1,015,100,000 tralia. But tbe caution we suggest is in",58
NA,the main a caution against over-exuber-,58
NA,ance; the responsibilities we foresee,58
NA,should be well within our strength. A l l in,58
NA,"all, conditions are favorable to further",58
NA,sound progress in the year ahead. The,58
NA,main thing is for the various elements in,58
NA,"our economy to keep in step and not try,",58
NA,"251,000 each individually, to thrust itself forward",58
NA,at the expense of the others.,58
NA,I n this budget we have observed the,58
NA,"essential principle that, during times when",58
NA,the nation's capacity is almost fully,58
NA,"extended, revenue should at least balance",58
NA,expenditure. We have been able to do this,58
NA,while providing not only for certain neces-,58
NA,sarily larger commitments but also for,58
NA,active encouragement through tax reduc-,58
NA,"tions to effort, saving and enterprise. I f",58
NA,there is a similar determination through-,58

Sir ARTHUR FADDEN ,MCPherson-,80
NA,Treasurer) [9.11] - I move-,80
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,80
NA,"The purpose of this, bill, in_ conjunction",80
NA,"with a resolution which I shall move later,",80
NA,"is to give effect, to. sales tax concessions",80
NA,"involving a loss to revenue of £12,822,000",80
NA,"iu a full financial year,, and £9,892,000 in",80
NA,the. current financial year. The Govern-,80
NA,ment haa taken much care to select con-,80
NA,cessions which will either contribute to,80
NA,"the reduction, of costs in industry or will",80
NA,be of assistance to home builders and,80
NA,"furnishers.. Particular consideration, has",80
NA,"been given to the effect of sales, tax upon",80
NA,"industrial costs, because the. Government",80
NA,"regards th® minimizing, of suchi costs, of",80
NA,"great, importance..",80
NA,"Ashonorable members' know, manu-",80
NA,"facturers already enjoy exemption, from",80
NA,EADDBNI)' sales tax in respect of machinery and,80
NA,equipment used by them in manufacturing,80
NA,operations'. Persons: engageds in the,80
NA,mining industry also benefit from* an,80
NA,exemption of plant used in mining opera-,80
NA,"tions, and in treating theproducts of these",80
NA,"operations,, but neither has been able in",80
NA,the past to purchase machinery and plant,81
NA,used i n the repair of their manufacturing,81
NA,or producing plant without payment of,81
NA,sales tax on it. This bill provides for the,81
NA,exemption of the plant used by manu-,81
NA,facturers and persons engaged in the,81
NA,mining industry in the repair or main-,81
NA,tenance of their machinery.,81
NA,There are other new exemptions de-,81
NA,signed to reduce costs. Exemption is,81
NA,being granted in respect of machinery,81
NA,and equipment used for business purposes,81
NA,in the servicing or repair of motor,81
NA,vehicles and aircraft. Equipment used,81
NA,"in business operations in the construction,",81
NA,"repair or maintenance of buildings, roads,",81
NA,dams and other works will also be exempt.,81
NA,Machinery used by boot repairers will be,81
NA,exempt. Exemption is being granted in,81
NA,respect of safety equipment for use in,81
NA,"industrial operations, and also in respect",81
NA,of clock systems and time-recording,81
NA,apparatus for use for business or indus-,81
NA,"trial purposes, other than clocks and",81
NA,watches which remain subject to tax at,81
NA,the rate of 16$ per cent.,81
NA,Hand tools of a kind used for industrial,81
NA,purposes are to be exempt. This exemp-,81
NA,tion will contribute to the reduction of,81
NA,"costs in industry and, in addition, will",81
NA,help artisans and home purchasers of,81
NA,such tools. Manufacturers of carbonated,81
NA,"beverages, whose problems of costs appear",81
NA,"to be particularly acute, have long",81
NA,complained of having to pay tax on the,81
NA,containers in which their goods ai'e sold,81
NA,because of a deposit charged thereon.,81
NA,Exemption is now being allowed in,81
NA,"respect of bottles and cases, or crates,",81
NA,for use in the marketing of their products.,81
NA,"Vendors of goods generally, particularly",81
NA,"retailers, will have their costs reduced by",81
NA,"a new exemption of paper bags, wrap-",81
NA,ping paper and string used to wrap up,81
NA,and secure goods for delivery. There is,81
NA,a wide demand for exemption of furni-,81
NA,ture and household goods. These goods,81
NA,"cover a very wide range, indeed, and the",81
NA,cost of a complete exemption would be,81
NA,so heavy as to render this impracticable,81
NA,"at present. It is proposed, however, to",81
NA,reduce from the general rate of 12-J per,81
NA,"cent, to a special rate of 10 per cent, a",81
NA,wide range of furniture and household,81
NA,goods as specified in the bill. It is,81
NA,believed that this will appreciably reduce,81
NA,the costs of home establishment.,81
NA,Sir Arthur Fadden.,81
NA,Exemption is being granted in respect,81
NA,of aeroplanes for all purposes. The,81
NA,limited field of exemptions included when,81
NA,the sales tax legislation was first intro-,81
NA,"duced in 1930, did not include aeroplanes.",81
NA,"But, in 1934, when the list of exemptions",81
NA,"was generally revised, provision was made",81
NA,for exemption of aeroplanes. This,81
NA,exemption remained in force until,81
NA,"November, 1940, when, because of the",81
NA,"exigencies of war, a number of exemp-",81
NA,"tions was withdrawn, including that",81
NA,"relating to aeroplanes. Last year, the",81
NA,law was amended to authorize exemption,81
NA,of aircraft other than those used for,81
NA,commercial purposes. This was done,81
NA,largely as the result of requests for relief,81
NA,"from tax on behalf of aero clubs, which",81
NA,render valuable service to the community,81
NA,in the teaching of flying. A thorough,81
NA,examination made since that date has,81
NA,disclosed that the imposition of sales tax,81
NA,on aeroplanes would impose a heavy,81
NA,"burden on commercial airline operators,",81
NA,resulting in the substantial inflation of,81
NA,their already heavy costs of new aircraft,81
NA,"and would, in due course, be reflected in",81
NA,higher fare and freight costs. The prob-,81
NA,lem of costs of these operators has been,81
NA,accentuated by the necessity to expend,81
NA,large sums of money in the purchase of a,81
NA,considerable number of new aircraft at,81
NA,the present time in order to replace old,81
NA,machines and maintain efficient service.,81
NA,I t is relevant to note also i n this con-,81
NA,"nexion, that ships are not subject to",81
NA,sales tax whilst railway rolling stock,81
NA,does not bear sales tax because of the,81
NA,exemption of government departments.,81
NA,For these reasons it has been decided to,81
NA,make the exemption absolute so as to,81
NA,exempt these goods regardless of the pur-,81
NA,"pose of their use, as was the case before",81
NA,1940. The exemption will apply not only,81
NA,"to freight and passenger airliners, but",81
NA,also to aircraft used for agricultural,81
NA,purposes in spraying or spreading fer-,81
NA,tilizer or seed. The exemption of aero-,81
NA,planes is to be made effective as from the,81
NA,"1st January, 1946. The reasons for this",81
NA,"decision are:-First , that exemption",81
NA,applied to Trans-Australia Airlines until,81
NA,"1952, when it was made subject to tax;",81
NA,"secondly, exemption was granted to the",81
NA,British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines,81
NA,Limited and Qantas Airways Limited in,81
NA,"1946 and 1947, respectively; and, thirdly,",82
NA,the Government now believes that it,82
NA,would have been just and proper to re-,82
NA,store the exemption which existed for,82
NA,aeroplanes from 1934 to 1940 imme-,82
NA,diately the war ended and the develop-,82
NA,ment of air transport services in Aus-,82
NA,tralia was resumed.,82
NA,I t is the clearly stated nolicy of the,82
NA,Government that competition between,82
NA,Government airlines and privately owned,82
NA,airlines shall be on equal terms. The,82
NA,pre-dating of the exemption of aeroplanes,82
NA,will remove some inconsistencies of treat-,82
NA,ment as between the Government airlines,82
NA,and several private operators. I n the,82
NA,"course of the examination of this subject,",82
NA,it was discovered that some aeroplanes,82
NA,have been imported and put into opera-,82
NA,tion without sales tax having been paid,82
NA,upon them. This was due to an irregular,82
NA,but inadvertent use of registered tax-,82
NA,"payers' certificates, and to the belief that",82
NA,the same freedom from sales tax that,82
NA,applied to the Government airlines would,82
NA,apply also to other commercial transport,82
NA,systems. The exemption which is now,82
NA,being enacted will obviato the necessity,82
NA,for retrospective action to collect the tax,82
NA,"not paid and will, at the same time, sub-",82
NA,stantially restore equality of treatment,82
NA,to all competing lines. The back-dating,82
NA,"of, the exemption may necessitate certain",82
NA,"refunds, but these will be comparatively",82
NA,"small, and they will be payable mainly to",82
NA,small airline operators and aero clubs.,82
NA,The exemption of parts of aeroplanes will,82
NA,"not come into operation, however, until",82
NA,"the 19th August, 1954, the date of com-",82
NA,mencement of the amending bill. Though,82
NA,it is realized that this will still leave,82
NA,Government airlines in a position of,82
NA,advantage compared with,82
NA,operators so far as transactions prior to,82
NA,"November, 1952, are concerned, the Go-",82
NA,vernment has not been able to go so far,82
NA,as to remedy this anomaly. The Civil,82
NA,Aviation Agreement Act 1952 ensures,82
NA,equality of treatment from the date of its,82
NA,enactment.,82
NA,"Ice cream, confectionery, musical",82
NA,instruments and toys and associated,82
NA,goods are at present subject to tax at the,82
NA,maximum rate of 16jj per cent. The,82
NA,Government has had continuous and,82
NA,pressing representations concerning the,82
NA,effect of increasing costs on the market for,82
NA,"these commodities. Though, in some",82
NA,"senses, they may be regarded as less essen-",82
NA,"tial commodities, they occupy a very",82
NA,"definite place in the economy, some using",82
NA,large quantities of primary products and,82
NA,all providing much work in a variety,82
NA,of industries. To prevent the tax,82
NA,"becoming too regressive in its effect, it has",82
NA,been decided to transfer these goods to,82
NA,the general classification and henceforth,82
NA,they will be subject to tax at 12-J per,82
NA,cent.,82
NA,Tlie bill contains numerous other new,82
NA,exemptions and re-expressions of exist-,82
NA,ing exemptions designed to remove anoma-,82
NA,lies and difficulties associated with their,82
NA,"administration. For example, leather,",82
NA,"solder, methylated spirits and iron and",82
NA,"steel wire of gauges 15 to 18, are goods",82
NA,which have hitherto only been exempt,82
NA,"when purchased for certain purposes, and",82
NA,certificates as to those purposes were a,82
NA,pre-requisite to the obtaining of exemp-,82
NA,tion. They will now be exempt uncondi-,82
NA,"tionally, thus relieving purchasers of the",82
NA,obligation to furnish certificates as to the,82
NA,intended use of the goods. The agricul-,82
NA,tural industry will benefit by a new,82
NA,exemption for live-stock carriers of the,82
NA,kind attached to motor vehicles or wagons.,82
NA,Seed-cleaning machinery is being,82
NA,exempted and the exemptions of goods for,82
NA,use in tho destruction of animal pests,82
NA,have been revised to remove anomalies,82
NA,arising from previous limitations. Exemp-,82
NA,tion is now authorized in respect of,82
NA,poisons and traps for the destruction of,82
NA,all classes of noxious animals. Materials,82
NA,"the other than fertilizers, for use in the im-",82
NA,"provement of crops, are also being brought",82
NA,private within the scope of the exemptions.,82
NA,Exemptions of surgical goods are being,82
NA,extended to cover certain classes of goods,82
NA,which are used to overcome physical,82
NA,"disabilities, and provision is being made",82
NA,for exemption of certain goods used in,82
NA,the cleaning of teeth and massaging of,82
NA,gums to minimize dental decay. I n the,82
NA,"past, physiotherapists have not ' been",82
NA,entitled to exemption of surgical equip-,82
NA,ment which has been free of tax when,82
NA,purchased by hospitals or medical prac-,82
NA,titioners. As the work of physiothera-,82
NA,"pists is growing in importance, and is",82
NA,"closely associated ""with the ^treatment of",83
NA,"patients hy medical -practitioners, the",83
NA,law is -being amended to bring 'registered,83
NA,physiotherapists within the scope of the,83
NA,exemption.',83
NA,An anomaly with regard to certain,83
NA,"cleaning and polishing cloths, being",83
NA,articles specially manufactured for those,83
NA,"purposes, is also being removed. These",83
NA,goods are sold in competition with articles,83
NA,"whic'h have 'been exempt as piece goods,",83
NA,as they were subjected to no other process,83
NA,than cutting from the roll of material as,83
NA,manufactured. Cloths of this kind made,83
NA,"fiom piece goods will now be exempt,",83
NA,regardless of the degree of manufacture to,83
NA,which they have been subjected! A state-,83

NA,heen circulated to honorable .members sets,88

NA,"goods, filament lamps of the types ordi-",88
NA,narily used in motor vehicles for lighting,88
NA,"-purposes, -cooking stoves and cooking",88

NA,weaving and spinning industries. I n each,88
NA,instance the proposed -variations arise,88
NA,from inquiries conducted 'by the Tariff,88
NA,Board. Increased duties are proposed on,88
NA,"cotton canvas and cotton duck piece goods,",88
NA,heat storage cooking 'stoves and cooking,88
NA,ranges with an oven roasting capacity of,88
NA,"not more than 4,000 cubic inches, formal-",88
NA,"dehyde, true vegetable parchment paper,",88

NA,"poses, and heat storage cooking stoves",88
NA,and ranges with an oven roasting capa-,88

NA,Other customs amendments are those,88
NA,"covering clocks, n.e.i -fo r example, alarm",88
NA,"and household clocks-cloc k movements,",88
NA,and brandy in respect of which reduced,88
NA,"duties are, in each instance proposed. For",88
NA,administrative reasons it has been neces-,88
NA,sary to vary the wording of the customs,88
NA,"items covering fork-lift trucks, hog de-",88
NA,hairing machines and punching and,88
NA,shearing machines. The rates of duty,88
NA,"have not, however, been varied.",88
NA,The proposed amendment to the,88
NA,Customs Tariff .(Canadian Preference),88
NA,1934-1954 is complementary to the pro-,88
NA,posed .amendment made in the Customs,88
NA,Tariff 1933-19:54 with respect to fork-lift,88
NA,trucks. The rates of duty remain,88
NA,unchanged.,88
NA,The only excise amendment proposed,88
NA,relates to a -reduction of 30s. a proof,88
NA,gallon on locally produced brandy. Tbe,88
NA,reduction is designed to assist the grape-,88
NA,growing industry. Present indications,88
NA,are that .a large quantity of wine .grapes,88
NA,"'which could .be used for the distillation, of",88
NA,brandy will remain unharvested from,88
NA,the next .'season's crop ''Unless some action,88
NA,is .taken -to create a demand for these,88
NA,grapes. The revenue loss arising from,88

NA,"nical missions to those countries, and the",89
NA,Minister for External Affairs ( Mr.,89
NA,"Casey), in answer to a question this",89
NA,"afternoon, informed the House that",89
NA,surgical teams had also been sent to,89
NA,them.,89
NA,I do not desire to discuss those matters,89
NA,"at length, because extensive reference",89
NA,was made to them in the debate on inter-,89
NA,"national affairs. However, I should like",89
NA,to repeat a suggestion that I made in that,89
NA,debate for the despatch by Australia of,89
NA,tonms to Asian countries that are,89
NA,threatened by the onward march of com-,89
NA,munism. Honorable members will recall,89
NA,"that I suggested that we send "" teams for",89
NA,"democracy"" to those countries, because",89
NA,I feel sure that despite the recent peace,89
NA,"that has been gained in Viet Nam, the",89
NA,Communists are already organizing them-,89
NA,"selves, not only for the elections that will",89
NA,"be held in Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia",89
NA,"in approximately two years' time, but also",89
NA,for further conquests. We are not en-,89
NA,"gaged now in a "" cold war "". This is a",89
NA,"-*ar of hot bullets, and the Communists",89
NA,still have effective control of the areas,89
NA,which they have conquered. I warmly,89
NA,support the despatch of technical missions,89
NA,"to the Colombo plan countries, but I",89
NA,consider that it would also be of great,89
NA,advantage to the cause of peace and,89
NA,democracy i f we sent working teams to,89
NA,them so that they could see members of,89
NA,the British Commonwealth of Nations in,89
NA,action. The British Commonwealth,89
NA,includes peoples of various races and,89
NA,"beliefs, but all of them believe in demo-",89
NA,"cracy. I t is a loosely-knit organization,",89
NA,but it has set an example to the world of,89
NA,how a number of countries can live,89
NA,together and progress together that no,89
NA,other combination of nations has been,89
NA,able to give.,89
NA,"The Governor-General said, in his",89
NA,Speech-,89
NA,My Government is undertaking a re-organi-,89
NA,zation of the defence programme to achieve,89
NA,thc maximum secui'ity that the country can,89
NA,"provide for a long period, having regard to",89
NA,the needs not only of defence but also of,89
NA,"economic stability, a steady development of",89
NA,"population and resources, and high levels of",89
NA,production and employment.,89
NA,I listened with interest this afternoon,89
NA,tr. the speech of the honorable member,89
NA,"for Henty ( Mr Gullett), and I think that",89
NA,Mr Dean.,89
NA,all honorable members will agree with his,89
NA,statement on the necessity for the adop-,89
NA,tion of certain measures for the military,89
NA,defence of Australia. He also spoke,89
NA,"about the security of our country, not in",89
NA,reference to espionage or counter,89
NA,"espionage, but in the sense of national",89
NA,prosperity and development. I should,89
NA,like to develop that matter for a few,89
NA,moments. We in Australia are now in a,89
NA,fortunate and prosperous state. I believe,89
NA,it is true to say that it is a long time since,89
NA,Australia has been in such a fortunate,89
NA,economic condition in so many ways.,89
NA,Some of our primary industries are i n a,89
NA,strong economic position. The wheat,89
NA,"industry has its problems, but they are",89
NA,being dealt with separately. The dairy-,89
NA,"ing industry has had several problems,",89
NA,"especially in recent years, and they are",89
NA,being dealt with separately. The small,89
NA,"farmer, such as the orchardist, the citrus-",89
NA,"grower, the poultry-farmer and the pig-",89
NA,"farmer, has some serious problems at the",89
NA,present time. I f Australia is to be made,89
NA,"economically secure, the problems of the",89
NA,smaller primary industries must be,89
NA,speedily solved. Those industries must,89
NA,"be stabilized, and the producers engaged",89
NA,in them must receive a worthwhile return,89
NA,for their labour and for the capital that,89
NA,they have invested in their properties.,89
NA,4,89
NA,On a number of occasions during the,89
NA,"last twelve months, honorable members on",89
NA,"this side of the House, including myself,",89
NA,have made representations on behalf of,89
NA,"the poultry industry, and the Government",89
NA,has been able to take action to overcome,89
NA,some of its difficulties. At the beginning,89
NA,"of the year, £250,000 was made available",89
NA,to the industry to assist it to overcome,89
NA,a difficulty caused by a fall in the price,89
NA,of Australian eggs sold on the United,89
NA,Kingdom market. The industry still has,89
NA,some problems to solve. There are short-,89
NA,"term problems, in respect of which imme-",89
NA,"diate assistance is required, and long-",89
NA,"term problems, which involve long-term",89
NA,planning to stabilize the industry.,89
NA,Assistance could be in the form of a,89
NA,"subsidy on stock-feed wheat, or financial",89
NA,assistance to poultry-farmers in con-,89
NA,nexion with the export of eggs to the,89
NA,"United Kingdom, or direct financial",89
NA,"assistance to egg producers, given through",89
NA,the Australian Egg Board and dis-,89
NA,tributed by the State Egg Boards. My,89
NA,view is that direct financial assistance,90
NA,would be of most benefit to the industry.,90
NA,I have mentioned these matters because,90
NA,I think i t is necessary to remind the,90
NA,Parliament that some of our small p r,90
NA,mary industries are i n urgent need of,90
NA,assistance.,90
NA,Let me deal briefly with the citrus,90
NA,dustry and give a resume of a letter,90
NA,have received. The writer states that,90
NA,one of the problems with which the into,90
NA,dustry is faced is that i n the case,90
NA,many of its products supply is in excess,90
NA,of demand. That problem is shared by,90
NA,some of the other small primary indusproduced,90
NA,"tries but, according to this letter, the",90
NA,difficulty is not so widespread i n the distributed.,90
NA,"citrus industry, because in some areas",90
NA,the production per tree is much greater,90
NA,"than i n others, and in those areas the",90
NA,overhead expenses of production are,90
NA,paratively low. That comment expresses,90
NA,a sectional viewpoint because i t applies,90
NA,only to certain areas. Other areas,90
NA,affected to a greater degree. The writer them is the Government,90
NA,states-,90
NA,"The whole thing is indeed a, complex",90
NA,"lem, and there is a feeling within the industry",90
NA,tliat there should be some price support or,90
NA,guarantee for these small primary industries.,90
NA,It does not seem just that every industry,90
NA,all labour has some sort of guarantee,90
NA,"profit, whereas the smaller farmer, who",90
NA,the backbone of so much of our primary,90
NA,"industry and our national wealth, should",90
NA,"out on a limb, as i t were, without very",90
NA,people caring about his problems.,90
NA,That comment expresses the genuine,90
NA,belief of a number of the smaller primary,90
NA,producers. I agree that some of their,90
NA,"problems, especially marketing problems,",90
NA,are the direct responsibility of the various,90
NA,"State governments, but those governments",90
NA,are not accepting their responsibility.,90
NA,Although they say they are doing everyit,90
NA,thing i n their power to assist primary,90
NA,"producers, they have doubled the freight",90
NA,on primary products and i n that,90
NA,added to the problems with which the principal reasons for the,90
NA,primary producers are faced.,90
NA,I want to digress fo r a moment to speak,90
NA,of the supply of materials to primary,90
NA,ducers as a whole. There has been quite,90
NA,"a lot of comment recently, especially i",90
NA,"the country press, about what has been",90
NA,called a reduction of the supply of,90
NA,"fencing wire, galvanized iron, galvanized",90
NA,iron piping and superphosphate. I sliall,90
NA,"not deal with superphosphate, because",90
NA,was dealt with this afternoon by the,90
NA,Minister f o r Commerce and Agriculture,90
NA,( Mr MCEwen) i n answer to a question.,90
NA,The first thing we must realize is that,90
NA,i - the Commonwealth has no constitutional,90
NA,power i n this matter. A t the beginning,90
NA,"of this week, the Minister f o r National",90
NA,i n - Development (Senator Spooner) made «,90
NA,I statement i n which he said-,90
NA,I want to emphasize that the Commonwealth,90
NA,hus uo direct constitutional power with regard,90
NA,tliu production and distribution within,90
NA,of Australia of any commodity. The Common-,90
NA,"wealth Government, therefore, cannot deter-",90
NA,mine how much steel or how much of any,90
NA,of the wide range of steel products shall be,90
NA,"in Australia, nor can the Govern",90
NA,ment determine how such products are to be,90
NA,"Despite that lack of constitutional power,",90
NA,the Commonwealth assists primary pro-,90
NA,ducers in this connexion i n any way in,90
NA,comwhich it can do so. The House knows,90
NA,that honorahle menibers on this.side of,90
NA,the chamber have organized themselves,90
NA,are into a number of committees. One of,90
NA,Members,90
NA,Materials Committee. The Ministers,90
NA,probconcerned are well aware of the fact-find-,90
NA,"ing work done, and the recommendations",90
NA,"made, by that committee. I t has assisted",90
NA,"and the Minister fo r National Development,",90
NA,of the Minister for Commerce and Agri-,90
NA,is culture and the Minister f o r Labour and,90
NA,be National Service ( Mr H o l t ) to pro-,90
NA,many vide labour for certain industries. The,90
NA,"committee has been able to short-circuit,",90
NA,"as i t were, channels of information and",90
NA,so assist to solve a number of problems.,90
NA,"I t is not correct to say, as some people",90
NA,"have said, that the production of",90
NA,materials vital to onr primary producers,90
NA,"has decreased. I n nearly every case,",90
NA,production has increased. I n some cases,90
NA,"is twice, and i n other cases three times,",90
NA,as great as i t was i n 1949. But i n many,90
NA,instances the demand has quadrupled,90
NA,way during that time. That is one of the,90
NA,apparent,90
NA,shortage.,90
NA,I t has been stated also that steel pro-,90
NA,"products vitally needed i n Australia, have",90
NA,been exported to overseas countries. I n,90
NA,"n the broad sense, that statement is untrue.",90
NA,"As I have explained to the House before,",90
NA,we have an obligation to maintain sup-,90
NA,plies of these essential products to coun,90
NA,tries that are traditional markets for us.,90
NA,i t I refer particularly to New Zealand and,90
NA,"tha islands, toour north. Wesupply them",91
NA,"with reasonable) quantities, oi. galvanized",91
NA,"iron, nails,, wire and other steel products.",91
NA,"I think every; ona agrees that', we. should",91
NA,"do so. Generally speaking;, we have ex-",91
NA,"ported, products of this; typa to countries;",91
NA,other than New Zealandaoid the islands:,91
NA,"only when there: has-, been a. glut. Our.",91
NA,"steel industry is expanding,, and occa-",91
NA,sionally there are: temporary surpluses,91
NA,of certain products because expansion of,91
NA,capacity at. the next stage of production,91
NA,"has not been completed. It, may be o£",91
NA,"interest to. the, House, to. learn that last-",91
NA,"year we exported only 9 per cent, of our",91
NA,"production of galvanized iron,, only 1",91
NA,"per cent, of our production of barbed",91
NA,"wire and only G.9 per cent., of our pro-",91
NA,"duction of wire, netting.. With, regard",91
NA,"to water piping, which primary pro-",91
NA,"ducers use for irrigation purposes, only,",91
NA,"about 15 per cent, of our production wa3",91
NA,"exported. I . understand that, when the.",91
NA,new rolling mill that is being erected at,91
NA,Port Kembla comes into operation at the,91
NA,"end of this year or early, next year, we",91
NA,shall have an annual exportablesurplus,91
NA,"of 15,000 tons of galvanized iron. Ob-",91
NA,"viously, we could not haveincreased iron",91
NA,"and steel production, so greatly i f coal,",91
NA,production had not. been increased. The,91
NA,thanks and congratulations of Aus-,91
NA,tralians generally are due to the men who.,91
NA,work in these basic industries and to,91
NA,those who manage the mines and fac-,91
NA,tories and plan their operations. The,91
NA,"great expansion of our basic industries,",91
NA,which will promote national development,91
NA,"and help us to strengthen our defences,",91
NA,is due in a very large measure to co-opera-,91
NA,tion between managements and workers.,91
NA,Having mentioned increased coal pro-,91
NA,"duction in passing, I take the opportunity",91
NA,to make a plea to those who are engaged,91
NA,"in the industry to co-operate in devising,",91
NA,a satisfactory plan for the. mechanical,91
NA,extraction of pillar coal. My .knowledge,91
NA,of. methods of working and conditions in,91
NA,"coal mines is limited, but there are. mines",91
NA,in the electorate that I represent and,91
NA,I visit them at fairly regular intervals,91
NA,in order to discuss with managements and,91
NA,workers the problems with which they,91
NA,have to. deal. I am sure that they can,91
NA,find a satisfactory solution to the problem',91
NA,of extracting pillar coal by mechanical,91
NA,Mr Dean.,91
NA,"means., I cannot see, any force in tha-",91
NA,"argument that i t ia safer, to extract, such,",91
NA,coal by the. old methods than to do so,91
NA,by mechanical means'.. Experiencein,91
NA,other countries hasproved that mecha-,91
NA,nical extraction by modern methods is-,91
NA,far safer than any other method.. There-,91
NA,"fore, I hope that the large tonnage of",91
NA,"pillar coal in mines in various, parts of.",91
NA,"Australia, will soon be made available,",91
NA,to industry for the benefit of the entire,91
NA,community.,91
NA,The rapid growth of Australia?s: popu-,91
NA,"lation should betaken: imto account, in the'",91
NA,"planning, of industrial expansion.",91
NA,"According to statistics , Australia's popu-",91
NA,1,91
NA,"lation five' years hence, without further-",91
NA,"immigration, should be' about 9i750i000,",91
NA,"and , with immigration at the expected'",91
NA,1,91
NA,"rate, it should be about lO^'OO^OOOl",91
NA,"According to the same figures,, our popu-",91
NA,"lation in 1965', without further immigra-",91
NA,"tion, should be 10,430,000, and with immi-",91
NA,"gration, 11,313,000.. Those facts demon-",91
NA,strate the urgent necessity for industrial,91
NA,expansion and the establishment of our,91
NA,"smaller primary industries on a, better and",91
NA,"more, stable, footing. I t would be a",91
NA,"national disaster, for instance, if we had to",91
NA,import eggs and pig meats so that Aust-,91

Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,91

Mr GRIFFITHS ,Shortland) [9.5S]' -,91
NA,Since the formal opening of the' Twenty-,91

NA,the time of the House has been occupied 1,91
NA,in debating international affairs and the,91
NA,Government's policy in relation to Aus-,91

NA,it should we fail to> find a satisfactory,91

NA,shocked to> read i n the press of the start-,91
NA,"ling admission by high, military officials'",91
NA,thatcii'EEent emlistmentai inour armed.,91
NA,forces are* far short of wastage. That,92
NA,"statement, to say t'he least,, should be",92
NA,"disconcerting, to all honorable, members.",92
NA,The first responsibility of the Govern-,92
NA,ment in office should be to ensure the-,92
NA,maintenance of Australia?* defence forces,92
NA,at full strength at all times. The text of,92
NA,"the report, which was published in the",92
NA,"Sydney. Morning Herald, of the 5th",92
NA,"August, was as follows:-",92
NA,Theflow of enlistments into the. Army is not,92

NA,""" The. wages now are not bad"",. he said.",92
NA,""" They match those of outside industry when",92
NA,"all things are considered "".",92
NA,"Obviously, somethingiswrong with the",92
NA,Army. The; Minister for the Army,92
NA,( Mr Francis) is doing nothing to,92
NA,rectify matters'. There is general dis-,92
NA,satisfaction' in the. Army; for which the,92
NA,Ministerand the Government are re-,92
NA,sponsible'. The Minister is: utterly-,92
NA,incapable of administering his portfolio,92
NA,"satisfactorily; It. is-no wond'es that, young",92
NA,men are reluctant toi join the Army.,92
NA,Many of our young mem. have: lost faith,92
NA,in the. Army and refuse to have anything,92
NA,to do. with it. The Government has. failed,92
NA,to make' adequate provision for army,92
NA,"personnel who, become i l l as! a result, of",92
NA,"military service. Many, of the brass hatsi",92
NA,of the army arenot fitted to hold their,92
NA,"high positions;; their services, should be",92
NA,dispensed with. They have an utter dis-,92
NA,regard for the problems: of serving,92
NA,"personnel. Only a very smallpercentage, of",92
NA,"the thousands of national, service, trainees",92
NA,w/ho. complete; their training each year,92
NA,j.oin the Austrailiam Regular Army. I,92
NA,wonder whether the Minister has ever,92
NA,considered' the' reason why so: many young-,92
NA,"men are reluctant to offer for service, 1",92
NA,"particularly in view of the' high rates, of",92
NA,pay. I . have been told by many trainees,92
NA,"that camp food; is bad and lacks variety,",92
NA,"and that at some camps butter is rarely,",92
NA,"if. ever,, provided. Conditions, in some",92
NA,army camps ar.a very bad. Many army,92
NA,officers do. not understand the problems,92
NA,of the men. in their charge. I have,92
NA,been told by recruits that applications for,92
NA,leave are invariably refused. I have,92
NA,persona] knowledge of instances'in - which,92
NA,leave to' servicemen to enable them to at-,92
NA,1,92
NA,tend tO' urgent family matters has been,92
NA,"refused-. Eecently a young trainee, who'",92
NA,had completed his three months' initial,92
NA,"service, was required to attend a week-",92
NA,"end bivouac He was. working, on the",92
NA,"12 midnight, to 8 ajn.. shift, at the",92
NA,"Newcastle, works of Lysaght's Limited,",92
NA,and intended to knock off early in order,92
NA,"to be on. parade at 9 a.m. However, he",92
NA,missed his bus. and did. not arrive at the,92
NA,"pa-rade ground, until about 9.30 a.m., by",92
NA,which time the troops had left.. On,92
NA,"reporting to the commanding officer, he",92
NA,"was. reprimanded.' The trainee, was then",92
NA,"told, that he would be required to attend'",92
NA,the next alternate parade. As' that,92
NA,parade was set down for a date,92
NA,on which his brother was. to be.',92
NA,"married, he sought, leave of absence,",92
NA,"but, was promptly told that he could not",92
NA,get it. His mother then submitted an,92
NA,"application on his behalf,, which, also,",92
NA,was refused. When I communicated with,92
NA,"the commanding officer, Lieutenant-",92
NA,"Colonel James, he told me that he did not",92
NA,1,92
NA,intend to give the lad leave as he had,92
NA,already missed one camp. The officer,92
NA,said that he did not want toestablish a,92
NA,precedent for leave i'n similar circum-,92
NA,stances.,92
NA,1,92
NA,Many trainees and members' of the,92
NA,Australian Regular Army have been,92
NA,"badly injured, and in some instances",92
NA,"killed, while living away from their home",92
NA,1,92
NA,"or usual place of domicile, allegedly on",92
NA,stand-down leave. There is. na pro-vision,92
NA,for the payment of comrensation in those,92
NA,circumstances. I ' recently mentioned in,92
NA,this House the case of a Tad who was,92
NA,"badly injured at Helidon in Queensland,,",92
NA,1,92
NA,and who is;now 80' per cent-incapacitated.,92
NA,He has not yet received one penny piece,92
NA,as compensation from the military,92
NA,"authorities. I n the same accident, the",92
NA,son of a constituent of the honorable mem-,92
NA,"ber, for New England (ME.. Drummond)",92
NA,lost four fingers from one of his hands.,93
NA,He has not been compensated. How can schooling.,93
NA,the Government expect young men to join,93
NA,the services while this state of affairs,93
NA,tinues? I f the Government really wants nerves.,93
NA,young men to join the services it should,93
NA,make provision not only for compensation had,93
NA,to be payable to servicemen in the also,93
NA,"event of injury or incapacity, but also",93
NA,to safeguard the interests of their wives,93
NA,and parents. Time will not permit me,93
NA,to relate many other reasons why young,93
NA,men are reluctant to join the services.,93
NA,I shall refer now to another matter,93
NA,relating to defence. On the Sth March and,93
NA,"last, three young servicemen lost their",93
NA,lives during an amphibious exercise,93
NA,Stockton Bight. I subsequently received,93
NA,"a letter from Mrs Moran, the mother for",93
NA,"of one of the boys, as well as letters",93
NA,"from two of his brothers, one of",93
NA,whom was with him on the craft yet,93
NA,that sank. These letters illustrate clearly,93
NA,the unsatisfactory manner in which the,93
NA,authorities deal with matters relating,93
NA,serving personnel. The young man who,93
NA,was drowned was a returned soldier. He me,93
NA,had been sent home from Morotai after snn,93
NA,his nerves had been shot to pieces during,93
NA,World War II . Despite the fact that,93
NA,"had been unemployed for many months,",93
NA,the Repatriation Commission refused,93
NA,grant him a war pension. The letter from,93
NA,Mrs Moran reads as follows:-,93
NA,I t is with great sorrow that I write,93
NA,"about my late son, Corp. Npel Moran, who",93
NA,lost his life on March 8th 1954 at Stockton.,93
NA,I t is nearly five months now since the,93
NA,dent happened and I have heard a few things ing.,93
NA,which I think we should have been told,93
NA,the military such as how Noel came to have,93
NA,his nose broken and what caused his face to,93
NA,be so badly marked.,93
NA,"My two other sons, Hon and Harold, saw",93
NA,body at the morgue and they hardly recognized,93
NA,him. They identified him by a scar on his,93
NA,caused from a burn with hot lead as a,93
NA,My married daughter asked i f she could,93
NA,and see him and she was told she could not.,93
NA,Colonel James said i t was best for her,93
NA,remember him as she last saw him.,93
NA,We had a l o t of promises made to us,93
NA,the military but as yet they have not,93
NA,any of them. The military oflicials promised,93
NA,to call back and see us to talk things over,93
NA,but we have not seen any of them since the,93
NA,accident.,93
NA,The shock has hit the family very hard,93
NA,ways. It has affected our health.,93
NA,band had ten weeks off work with,93
NA,I had five weeks in bed and my 11 year old,93
NA,Hr. Griffiths.,93
NA,daughter is still sick and under the doctor's,93
NA,care. Noel's death has - even affected her,93
NA,She came second i n her yearly,93
NA,"exam, and this half yearly she camu second",93
NA,conlast. She has lost a lot of school with bad,93
NA,Noel always saw to i t that the two youngest,93
NA,"everything they needed for school, and I",93
NA,can honestly say he partly kept - them. I,93
NA,feci his loss financially as he gave me,93
NA,£5 a week for board and always helped pay,93
NA,medical bills and many other expenses.,93
NA,The military did uot even go to the trouble,93
NA,to have Noel's personal belongings returned,93
NA,to mo after the accident. What hurts mc most,93
NA,is to think tliat the poor kid went to the war,93
NA,and was brought home in a straight jacket,93
NA,was only able to work three months out,93
NA,of the twelve months he was home.,93
NA,Noul also suffered from blackouts and,93
NA,in malaria. When he first came back from,93
NA,Morotai ho was taken to Kenmore Hospital,93
NA,"shock treatment, he also spent three mouths",93
NA,at Gilbulla Red Cross rest home at Menangle.,93
NA,At one time Noel applied for a pension but,93
NA,was told by thu doctor that he was a malingerer,93
NA,whun he went to join the permanent army,93
NA,ihey told him he had war nerves. So you,93
NA,can see he hasn't had anything from tbe army,93
NA,to only promises and a raw deal.,93
NA,I am Noel's mother nnd to me half my life,93
NA,"has gone, there arc many sleepless nights for",93
NA,and my hushand who cries to his dead,93
NA,for help in his sleep. My little daughter,93
NA,also cries a.nd asks for him. This is causing,93
NA,he the family great mental strain.,93
NA,I hope and pray that you may be able to,93
NA,to do something to help me.,93
NA,"Time will not permit me to read, as I",93
NA,"wished to do, extracts from the letters of",93
NA,"to you the soldier's two brothers, one of whom",93
NA,was in the boat with him. The coroner's,93
NA,inquiry was told that the hoy had no mark,93
NA,"accion him, and that he had died of drown-",93
NA,Yet the brothers have stated that,93
NA,by the dead boy had a horseshoe mark on,93
NA,"his forehead made by a boot-heel, that",93
NA,his nose was broken and spread across his,93
NA,"his face, and that his hair had turned white.",93
NA,His brothers were hardly able to recog-,93
NA,arm nize him. Yet the military authorities,93
NA,child. claim they help servicemen. The dead,93
NA,go lad's brother entered hospital after the,93
NA,to disaster for an appendix operation and a,93
NA,doctor told him that his appendix had be-,93
NA,by come swollen as a result of his immersion,93
NA,kept in salt water. Mr Moran wrote to the,93
NA,Imperial War Graves Commission and,93
NA,"asked that his son's grave be covered in,",93
NA,and a monument erected over it. The,93
NA,"all commission, in reply, told him that unless",93
NA,My husthe Australian Repatriation Department,93
NA,nerves. accepted the soldier's death as having,93
NA,been due to war service it could do noth-,94
NA,"ing about the matter, and advised Mr.",94
NA,Moran to write to that department. I,94
NA,believe that the military authorities,94
NA,should have taken this matter up them-,94
NA,"selves, without waiting for the father to",94
NA,write to them. I wrote to the Minister,94
NA,"about it on the 21st July, and he is still",94
NA,considering it. He merely sent me an,94
NA,acknowledgment of my letter.,94
NA,I consider that an examination of the,94
NA,"facts concerning this disaster, as known",94
NA,"to the general public, reveal two out-",94
NA,standing alternatives. The first is that,94
NA,a colossal blunder was made by some one,94
NA,in charge of the section of the Army con-,94
NA,"cerned, or by the commanding officer in",94
NA,"charge of the operation, for allowing the",94
NA,manoeuvre to take place under the condi-,94
NA,"tions that prevailed at the time, without",94
NA,having taken all possible measures,94
NA,"against its possible failure, with the",94
NA,tant loss of life and valuable equipment.,94
NA,"Tf a blunder was made, it is the duty",94
NA,"of the Government to admit the fact, to",94
NA,"pay compensation, and take the action",94
NA,necessary to ensure that such a happening,94
NA,will not occur again. The alternative is,94
NA,"that i f a blunder was not made, then this",94
NA,tragic happening assumes almost,94
NA,"criminal proportions, and those respon-",94
NA,sible for the loss of life caused by it,94
NA,should be punished. A satisfactory,94
NA,settlement of the matter involves the,94
NA,answering of many searching questions,94
NA,"that have been asked, and the Minister",94
NA,should let the general public have the,94
NA,answers to them. The relatives of the,94
NA,lads who lost their lives and the people,94
NA,"generally, want answers to the following",94
NA,questions:-1 . What regulations cover,94
NA,"amphibious training operations, and",94
NA,were these regulations fully complied,94
NA,with ? 2. Was the Army command aware,94
NA,that the operations being undertaken,94
NA,would involve the amphibious vehicles,94
NA,covering a distance of more than 40 miles,94
NA,by open sea? 3. What expert authority,94
NA,"certified the craft as seaworthy, and was",94
NA,a certificate obtained from the Navigation,94
NA,Department to that effect 4. Have,94
NA,similar craft elsewhere been used pre-,94
NA,"viously for operations in the open sea,",94
NA,or are such craft normally used in ship-to-,94
NA,shore operations from mother ships?,94
NA,5. Was the Navigation Department,94
NA,"advised of the manoeuvre and, i f so, was",94
NA,it informed that should distress signals,94
NA,be fired no aid would be required from,94
NA,the navigation authorities? 6. I f the,94
NA,navigation authorities were not informed,94
NA,"of -the manceuvre, why did the officer on",94
NA,duty at Nobby's not send out the pilot,94
NA,boat to investigate the reason for the,94
NA,firing of distress rockets? 7. Why did,94
NA,wireless communication fail so quickly,94
NA,"between all vehicles, i f the sea was safe?",94
NA,Other questions involving engine,94
NA,"capacity, the pumping system, signalling",94
NA,"lights, navigation lights, radio protection",94
NA,"from shipped seas, and whether open",94
NA,"craft, such as were used in this manceuvre,",94
NA,with approximately only 18 inches of,94
NA,"freeboard, are capable of discharging",94
NA,"water shipped from heavy seas, also",94
NA,require answering before relatives of the,94
NA,bereaved and the general public will be,94
NA,satisfied that the operation was intended,94
NA,resulto be anything more than a stunt or a,94
NA,picnic affair. Too many conflicting,94
NA,stories have been told about this tragic,94
NA,happening. The coroner was told that,94
NA,the sea was almost normal. Yet on the,94
NA,morning of the disaster the press every-,94
NA,where in Australia told of huge seas along,94
NA,the coast and of the record life-saving,94
NA,efforts that life-savers on the beaches had,94
NA,to make to save bathers from drowning.,94
NA,No fewer than 349 beach rescues were,94
NA,made between Sydney and Newcastle.,94
NA,A headline that appeared in the Newcastle,94
NA,Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate,94
NA,"cn the 8th March, which was the day of",94
NA,"the tragedy, read-",94
NA,349 rescues from sea in 2 areas.,94
NA,The press stories told of such incidents,94
NA,"on the previous day as a surf ski, which",94
NA,was to be used in a championship beach,94
NA,"event, having been smashed by heavy",94
NA,seas. I t was not until late in the after-,94
NA,noon of the 8th March that Newcastle,94
NA,residents received the news of what was,94
NA,described as a shocking military disaster,94
NA,"in Stockton Bight. At first, the news of",94
NA,the disaster was vague. Rumours regard-,94
NA,"ing the number of deaths varied. Parents,",94
NA,relatives and friends of the men were,94
NA,making frantic and frenzied inquiries,94
NA,about lads who were to take part in the,94
NA,amphibious operation. Telephone lines,94
NA,"were choked. I n fact, it was impossible to",94
NA,obtain a clear picture of what had hap-,94
NA,pened. For a time newspaper reporters,94
NA,were able .to obtain a little information,95
NA,"about the disaster., but a complete ban",95
NA,"was -soon placed -on the release of news,",95
NA,:and people could find out nothing about,95
NA,-the matter. I t was not until the next .day,95
NA,"that .a clear picture emerged, and it",95
NA,became known that 184 members of the,95
NA,"Fifteenth Northern .Rivers Lancers, -com-",95
NA,prising officers and men iof the Citizen,95
NA,"Military Forces, and .national service",95
NA,"trainees, had been through a terrifying",95
NA,ordeal. Three men liad lost their lives,95
NA,and much valuable machinery and equip-,95
NA,ment had been lost.,95
NA,As I see it this sad and unfortunate,95
NA,accident should .never have been allowed,95
NA,to happen. Someone blundered badly,95
NA,when the operation was sanctioned. It is,95
NA,.generally known that amphibious opera-,95
NA,tions are something new for the Aus-,95
NA,"tralian .Army. Jn fact, if my memory",95
NA,"serves me correctly, amphibious units",95
NA,have been established in the Australian,95
NA,Army only since the .end of World War,95
NA,"EL, and any experience gained by Aus-",95
NA,tralians in respect of this class of opera-,95
NA,"tion, or the capabilities of the vehicles",95
NA,"took part in the operation, has been",95
NA,gained as a result of Australian participa-,95
NA,tion in such operations .carried out,95
NA,by the TJnited States Army in the,95
NA,"Pacific islands during the last war,",95
NA,when similar craft were used in,95
NA,ship to shore operations and for covering,95
NA,beachhead landings. The general public,95
NA,-wants to know who was responsible for the,95
NA,happening and why it was allowed to take,95
NA,"place. Ever since the day of the tragedy,",95
NA,the Minister for the Army has refused to,95
NA,-di vulge the findings of the military court,95
NA,"of inquiry which, incidently, apparently",95
NA,had to sit on two occasions before the,95
NA,High Command was 'satisfied that it had,95
NA,obtained answers that would satisfy the,95
NA,Minister. Only an open public inquiry,95
NA,could solve this matter to the satisfaction,95
NA,of the bereaved parents and parents whose,95
NA,sons took part in the operation. The,95
NA,Minister refuses to allow such an inquiry,95
NA,to be held. I tell him now that if he had,95
NA,been -contesting either the Newcastle,95
NA,or the Shortland electorate at the last,95
NA,general election he would now be out,95
NA,"of a job, such is public indignation in",95
NA,-these electorates about his attitude. The,95
NA,Minister bas accused the honorable mem-,95
NA,ber for Newcastle (MT. Watkins) and me,95
NA,Mr Griffiths.,95
NA,of trying to .make political capital out -of,95
NA,this tragic (occurrence ibecause we 'sought,95
NA,"an open public inquiry, which -was being",95
NA,"demanded by ""the parents and rela-",95
NA,"tives of the troops (concerned, as well as",95
NA,iby the general public. The .Minister isaid,95
NA,that he l a s -nothing fiurither ito add about,95
NA,tihe disaster ;aaid that he is satisfied with,95
NA,.the finding of the court of inquiry. He,95
NA,"has said that no officer was to hlame, .and",95
NA,that no irregularities occurred. Neither,95
NA,"the ,peo,ple nor I accept the Minister's",95
NA,"assurances. They do not influence -me, or",95
NA,the thousands of people whose sons may,95
NA,meet a similar fate i n the future unless,95
NA,"this matter is fully ^probed, the whole",95
NA,truth .about it is told .and proper safe-,95
NA,guards taken. Too many contradictory,95
NA,statements liave been made about the,95
NA,whole matter. By refusing to hold a,95
NA,public inquiry the Minister and his,95
NA,"departmental officers are obviously hiding,",95
NA,behind the coroner's finding. I believe,95
NA,the witnesses who appeared at the,95
NA,"coroner's inquiry were .selected witnesses,",95
NA,because only twelve out of the 184 men,95
NA,who took part i n the manoeuvre were called,95
NA,"that to appear before the inquiry, and, accord-",95
NA,"ing to the press, only seven of them gave",95
NA,evidence. I t appears to me that much,95
NA,"has .been concealed. T-he coroner,, who",95
NA,"was a farmer, could not possibly cover",95
NA,the mass of material that would be,95
NA,required to carry out a satisfactory,95
NA,inquiry because the 'military authorities,95
NA,did not provide the necessary information.,95
NA,"A -coroner's duty, as I understand it,",95
NA,"is to ascertain the cause of death .and, i n",95
NA,cases i n which doctors refuse to issue a,95
NA,"death certificate, to decide whether there",95
NA,were any criminal aspects of the matter.,95
NA,I believe that many irregularities,95
NA,occurred in relation to this matter. For,95
NA,"instance, the commanding officer took his",95
NA,twelve-year-old son on the manoeuvre. I t,95
NA,is alleged that quantities of liquor were,95
NA,in the tanks and that there was .a huge,95
NA,refrigerator in one of the vessels which,95
NA,sank off Morna Point. The Minister,95
NA,s'hould probe these allegations in order,95
NA,to ascertain whether they are true. I t,95
NA,has been said that one lad who ;swam,95
NA,ashore with the twelve-year-old son of the,95
NA,commanding officer could probably have,95
NA,saved the life -of one of the other lads who,95
NA,drowned i f he had not had to look after,95
NA,this boy. The Minister should institute,95
NA,"am inquiry,. ,1 want to know whether the",96
NA,Minister has thanked menibers of the,96
NA,Stockton Surf Club and Constable,96
NA,"Wheeler of the Newcastle police, who left",96
NA,their beds in the early hours of the,96
NA,morning in order to help in the Tescues,96
NA,"and who saved, possibly, scores of lives.",96

NA,9 is not generally supposed that the wool-,96

NA,AYES. to draw the attention of the House to a,96
NA,"Haylen, L . C.",96
NA,"Joshua, I t.",96
NA,group of wool-growers who are -at present,96
NA,suffering a definite injustice. DuTing,96
NA,World War II . these men were engaged,96
NA,"Makin, N . ,T. O.",96
NA,"MCLeod, D.",96
NA,"in growing wool in a fairly small way,",96
NA,and they sold their wool to private buyers,96
NA,in order to obtain a quick return rather,96
NA,Peters. E. W.,96
NA,Pollard. R. T.,96
NA,than to take their chance of appraisement.,96
NA,When the time .came for the Joint,96
NA,"Organization profits to be distributed,",96
NA,"Thompson, A. V.",96
NA,Ward. E. ;T.,96
NA,the relevant legislation provided that no,96
NA,part of those profits would go to private,96
NA,wool-'buyers who had bought wool from,96

NA,the growers during the appraisement,96
NA,"Sheehan, 'T. period, but that the pTofits would be paid",96
NA,NOES. directly to the Tvool-growers concerned.,96
NA,That provision was contested by a,96
NA,"Howse, JT. p .",96

NA,interested in people getting their just,96
NA,"deserts, but I suggest that the Government",96
NA,-Wentworth. W. C.,96
NA,Wheeler. Tt. .C.,96
NA,might take some action .about the matter,96
NA,to which I am. referring in order to speed,96
NA,up payments from the Joint 'Organization,96
NA,.Davidson. C. TC-,96
NA,"-Gnllett, 'H. B. S. profits to the wool-growers affected.",96
NA,The Government gave an undertaking,97
NA,NA,97
NA,"the writ was first issued, that while",97
NA,gation was in progress it would not pay,97
NA,NA,97
NA,very slow in bringing his action before,97
NA,"the court, and consequently the growers",97
NA,were prevented from getting their,97
NA,"money during that time. Last year,",97
NA,the High Court of Australia gave a,97
NA,decision in this matter to the effect that,97
NA,NA,97
NA,and that the growers were entitled to,97
NA,this money. Since then the Government,97
NA,has stated that it cannot pay out the,97
NA,money because it does not know whether,97
NA,NA,97
NA,Council against the High Court's judg-,97
NA,"ment, and that there may be such an",97
NA,"appeal which would, i f it were successful,",97
NA,force the Government to pay out the,97
NA,NA,97
NA,wool-buyers.,97
NA,This situation appears to me to be,97
NA,quite unfair to the growers concerned.,97
NA,The gentleman who has initiated the liti-,97
NA,gation is not in any hurry to decide,97
NA,whether he will appeal to the Privy,97
NA,Council. In fact he has not hurried,97
NA,"himself since 1949, when he first issued",97
NA,the writ. Of course he is entitled to,97
NA,"take a reasonable time, but I suggest",97
NA,that it is now open to the Grovernment,97
NA,to take steps to force him to decide,97
NA,whether or not he will appeal to the,97
NA,Privy Council. I understand that he,97
NA,has to be allowed a reasonable time in,97
NA,"which to appeal, but I suggest that he",97
NA,has already had ample time. There are,97
NA,three courses open to the Government in,97
NA,"this matter. First, the Government",97
NA,NA,97
NA,to. make a decision whether they will,97
NA,"lodge an appeal before the Privy Council,",97
NA,and the Government could take any,97
NA,legal procedure available to it to force,97
NA,"that decision. Secondly, it could put Mr.",97
NA,Poulton in a position where it would be,97
NA,a hundred-to-one chance that the Privy,97
NA,Council would decide that a reasonable,97
NA,time for appeal had already elapsed. If,97
NA,the Government informed him that it,97
NA,intended to pay this money because he,97
NA,had been given every opportunity to make,97
NA,"up his mind whether he would appeal,",97
NA,"the Government could, after a lapse of",97
NA,one or two months or whatever time it,97
NA,Mr Freeth.,97
NA,"might consider reasonable, advise his",97
NA,solicitors that it was. in a position,97
NA,litito pay out the money without fear that,97
NA,a higher authority would suggest that,97
NA,NA,97
NA,able time in which to appeal.,97
NA,My third suggestion concerns some,97
NA,wool-growers in Western Australia. I n,97
NA,Western Australia a very substantial com-,97
NA,"pany of private wool-buyers, known as",97
NA,"Wilcox, Mofflin Limited, undertook to pay",97
NA,back to those wool-growers any Joint,97
NA,"Organization profits received, so that quite",97
NA,apart from any decision in the Poulton,97
NA,"case, the wool-growers who sold to Wilcox,",97
NA,Mofflin Limited have been entitled for,97
NA,some time to their share of the Joint,97
NA,"Organization profits. Wilcox, Mofflin",97
NA,Limited have stated that they cannot get,97
NA,the money from the Commonwealth,97
NA,because of the Commonwealth's under-,97
NA,NA,97
NA,-Commonwealth has stated that Mr.,97
NA,Poulton's solicitors will not release it,97
NA,"from its undertaking, even in respect of",97
NA,"this company. Therefore, the third way",97
NA,in which the Commonwealth could over-,97
NA,come the difficulty would be to arrange,97
NA,"with Wilcox, Moflin Limited to pay the",97
NA,money to the wool-growers and obtain the,97
NA,"necessary releases from Wilcox, Mofflin",97
NA,"Limited, or the wool-growers, contingent",97
NA,on any possible decision of the Privy,97
NA,Council.,97
NA,I have had long discussions with the,97
NA,Minister for Commerce and Agriculture,97
NA,"( Mr MCEwen) about this matter, and",97
NA,I am quite satisfied that he has always,97
NA,been willing and anxious to pay these,97
NA,"moneys, but that he has always believed",97
NA,that there are legal obstructions to such,97
NA,payments. The Attorney-General's,97
NA,Department considers that in due course,97
NA,the problem will be solved by effluxion of,97
NA,time. A l l that I am trying to do to-night,97
NA,"is to draw the attention of the House, and",97
NA,"the Ministers concerned, to the injustice",97
NA,that is being done by merely waiting for,97
NA,time to pass. I suggest that the depart-,97
NA,ments concerned should take some firm,97
NA,action to obtain quickly the money that,97
NA,these particular wool-growers are entitled,97
NA,to. Although wool-growers generally are,97
NA,"in a fairly prosperous position to-day,",97
NA,those who are concerned in this matter,97
NA,"were, at the time they sold their wool, in",97
NA,a fairly small way of business. Many of,98
NA,them have handed over their properties,98
NA,"to their sons, and have retired on a fairly",98
NA,small amount of capital which is rapidly,98
NA,dwindling. They have ear-marked this,98
NA,Joint Organization money for specific,98
NA,"purposes, and have waited for years for it.",98
NA,I t is highly desirable that the Government,98
NA,"should closely examine this matter, and",98
NA,ascertain whether it can take action in,98
NA,one of the three ways that I have,98
NA,suggested.,98
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Hindmarsh),98
NA,[10.39] -Th e matter to which I desire,98
NA,to draw the attention bf the House con-,98
NA,cerns the production of components for,98
NA,the Canberra jet bomber. I n South Aus-,98
NA,tralia there is a company known as,98
NA,"Chrysler Australia Limited, which has",98
NA,a contract for the manufacture of com-,98
NA,ponent parts for the Canberra jet bomber.,98
NA,That company is guilty of a practice-,98
NA,which requires immediate attention from,98
NA,the highest level. I refer to its system of,98
NA,"releasing, as correct, items which are later",98
NA,rejected by the Aeronautical Inspection,98
NA,Directorate. I n order to give an,98
NA,"example of what is happening, I have",98
NA,"here a note concerning a particular part,",98
NA,the serial number of which is CAL/WB/,98
NA,"CF/31. On the 9th July last, that part",98
NA,was rejected by an Aeronautical Inspec-,98
NA,"tion Directorate inspector, the note on the",98
NA,check slip being-,98
NA,Not acceptable. Workmanship and spot,98
NA,welding rough.,98
NA,I n spite of the fact that this part had,98
NA,"been rejected by the inspector, Chrysler",98
NA,Australia Limited continued to pro-,98
NA,duce it. I t is a component of such an,98
NA,important character that every phase of,98
NA,its manufacture must be checked and a,98
NA,history card made out for the whole of,98
NA,the process from the first moulding until,98
NA,"its final machining for installation. Yet,",98
NA,"I have here proof - tliat on the 13th July,",98
NA,four days after it had been rejected by the,98
NA,Aeronautical Inspection Directorate,98
NA,"inspector, this component was still being",98
NA,worked without rectification of the faults,98
NA,that had been referred to on the first,98
NA,inspection. The next inspection report,98
NA,stated-,98
NA,This assembly ia not acceptable to A.I.D.,98
NA,and is rejected. Workmanship and spot weld-,98
NA,ing too rough for acceptance.,98
NA,Some components are of such a vital,98
NA,nature that a Canberra jet bomber which,98
NA,was fitted with a faulty part could ex-,98
NA,plode in mid-air. The Aeronautical.,98
NA,Inspection Directorate has no means of,98
NA,"rejecting them. A l l it can say is that,",98
NA,"from a supervisory point of view, they",98
NA,"are acceptable. Under the regulations,",98
NA,"however, the company still has the right",98
NA,to send the component parts which have,98
NA,not been individually inspected by the,98
NA,Aeronautical Inspection Directorate to,98
NA,Fishermen's Bend where they may be,98
NA,made up and installed in Canberra,98
NA,bombers.,98
Mr WARD ,"Tha t is, the faulty parts?",98
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,"Yes , those",98
NA,that have not been inspected by the Aero-,98
NA,nautical Inspection Directorate. They,98
NA,are sent by the company to Fishermen's,98
NA,Bend to be installed there. I t is true that,98
NA,at Fishermen's Bend some of the defects,98
NA,are noted and some components returned,98
NA,to Adelaide as rejects.,98
Mr HASLUCK ,Ha s the honorable,98
NA,member first-hand knowledge of all of,98
NA,this?,98
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,"O f course,",98
NA,I have. I have referred to the serial,98
NA,number of the component.,98
Mr BEALE ,Wha t is the name of the,98
NA,component ?,98
Mr CLYDE CAMERON , I shall,98
NA,come to that. I now wish to refer to,98

NA,ihis company.,98
Mr HASLUCK ,T o whom was the,98
NA,report presented?,98
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Tha t is my,98
NA,business. I propose to inform the House,98
NA,of the contents of the report. I t is for,98
NA,the Government to look into this matter.,98
NA,I f it is found that anything I have said,98
NA,"is incorrect, I shall apologize for giving",98
NA,"false information to the House, which is",98
NA,more than a lot of other people would be,98

Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,One . of,99
NA,these Canberra' bombers has crashed,99

NA,"with the Comet jet aircraft overseas, and",99

NA,Assemblies which arebeing built injigs fully,99

NA,An auction sale at tha Services. Training,99

NA,be tlie beginning of the end for thc centre,99

NA,The sale will' be that of. thousands of pounds,99

NA,There has been nothing but silence from,99
NA,all attempts made in Canberra to find out,99
NA,what tlie Government intends' to d'o withthe,99
NA,centre. Various suggestions for its use have,99
NA,"The been made, but always there has been thi?",99
NA,same answer. That the centre is not suitable,99
NA,"Eespecttvel'y, fbr tliat particular thing.",99
NA,"Docs this sale mean that the Government,",99
NA,runs has decided the camp has no further use?,99
NA,"i l l the next, step be the sale: of the buildings'",99
NA,"and' everything else there, that goes, to make",99
NA,to produce au excellent camp?,99
NA,"Tliese ai;e questions which MUdura. would,",99
NA,like answered. They are. questions which,99
NA,Mil'dura hadhoped would never have to be-,99
NA,Sunraysia realizes: i t . has. an. asset ini,99
NA,thc centue. I t wants that asset madeuse of-,99
NA,"to* and made use of. in one piece, not scattered",99
NA,to as single buildings all over the Commonwealth..,99
NA,Not only is Mildura concerned with this,99
NA,"not matter. I t gpes much further, because",99
NA,the Government is considering the ques-,99
NA,1,99
NA,tion of defence and the trainingof Royal,99
NA,Australian Air Force personnel. This is,100
NA,a ready-made and ideally situated camp,100
NA,of which the Government should make,100
NA,some use. I am very pleased to see the,100
NA,Minister for Supply ( Mr Beale) in the,100
NA,chamber because the sale is being con-,100
NA,ducted by the Department of Supply.,100
NA,I am very pleased to see the Minister,100
NA,for the Army ( Mr Francis) because I,100
NA,am hopeful that the Department of the,100
NA,Army will be able to utilize the camp.,100
NA,"The camp, which was an air force train-",100
NA,"ing station during World War II . , . and",100
NA,which is situated near the borders of,100
NA,"South Australia, Yictoria and New South",100
NA,"Wales, has all the equipment and run-",100
NA,ways that are necessary for the training,100
NA,of air force personnel. Climatic condi-,100
NA,tions in that part of Australia are,100
NA,excellent for flying -intends,100
NA,Some of the items of equipment that,100
NA,are being sold may be quite unserviceable.,100
NA,I am not complaining so much about the,100
NA,"sale of equipment, but I should like to",100
NA,be informed whether it is being sold,100
NA,because it is unserviceable. Some people,100
NA,have the idea that probably this is the,100
NA,first step in the dismantling of the camp.,100
NA,"I protest against ,a<ny such proposal. Last",100
NA,week I asked the Minister for the Interior,100
NA,.( Mr Kent Hughes) whether the camp,100
NA,could be used for the civil defence,100
NA,school. He said fchat .he would investi-,100
NA,"gate the matter, but that i t did not seem",100
NA,to .him to be suitable for that purpose.,100
NA,I ask why it is not suitable. Is it not,100
NA,suitable for that purpose because it is too,100
NA,far from Sydney .and Melbourne and,100
NA,Adelaide? We want decentralized train-,100
NA,ing because it is the best kind of training.,100
NA,Decentralized training is being provided,100
NA,at the jungle training centre in Queens-,100
NA,"land, and I compliment the Minister for",100
NA,the Army upon the establishment of the,100
NA,centre. Some honorable members have,100
NA,"had experience of such camps, and they",100
NA,know that the further a camp is located,100
NA,from the city the better i t is.,100
NA,"Opposition menibers interjecting,",100
Mr TURNBULL , I know that hon-,100
NA,orable members who represent metro-,100
NA,politan electorates in New South Wales,100
NA,"do not like that kind of talk, but I sup-",100
NA,port the establishment of decentralized,100
NA,training centres. This camp was once,100
NA,"used as a university centre, but because",100
NA,it was too fer from the -.cities '.the (students,100
NA,and professors went iback to Melbourne.,100
NA,There is no need for ithe -Government to,100
NA,spend thousands of pounds on the -erec-,100
NA,tion of camps when i t can utilize a,100
NA,camp such as the one to which I have,100
NA,referred. I ask the Minister for Supply,100
NA,to state whether the equipment at this,100
NA,"camp is surplus and unserviceable, ancl",100
NA,also to indicate the future of the centre.,100
NA,I t has 'been used as an immigrant holding,100
NA,"centre, but when its use for that purpose",100
NA,was discontinued i t was placed under,100
NA,the eontrol of the Minister for the,100
NA,Interior ( Mr Kent Hughes) i n the,100
NA,hope that it would be used again,100
NA,for the purpose. I t is all right i f,100
NA,"bhe Government, in view of its plan to",100
NA,"bring more imimigi'ants into the country,",100
NA,"to retain, the -camp as a holding",100
NA,"centre, but the people of .Sunraysia are",100
NA,concerned about the possibility of its,100
NA,being dismantled. Such a step would,100
NA,mean an economic loss to the country,100
NA,because new camps could not be built on,100
NA,better locations and hetter buildings could,100
NA,not be provided. I ask the Minister for,100
NA,Supply and the Minister for the Army,100
NA,to give the House some information on,100
NA,"the matter. I n fact, I have written down",100
NA,the names of the Ministers who are,100
NA,affected. They are the Minister for,100
NA,"Immigration, the Minister for Defence,",100
NA,"the Minister for the Army, the Minister",100
NA,"for Air, the Minister for Supply, and",100
NA,the Minister for the Interior. I do not,100
NA,expect all of those Ministers to answer,100
NA,"the question, but the Minister for Supply",100
NA,has assured me that two of them will,100
NA,do so.,100
Mr BEALE ,Parramatta-Ministe r,100
NA,"for Supply) [10.57] -Tw o of them, in",100
NA,the person of myself as Minister for,100
NA,Supply and the Minister acting for the,100
NA,"Minister for Immigration, are now in the",100
NA,process of answering the question. The,100
NA,honorable member was kind enough,100
NA,to mention the matter to me. I can,100
NA,well understand the anxiety of the people,100
NA,of Mildura in relation to the future of,100
NA,this camp. The equipment that will,100
NA,be sold is not military equipment but is,100
NA,surplus equipment from the Department,100
NA,of .Immigration. The centre is at,100
NA,"present under the care of ,a .caretaker, but",100
NA,"it is expected tbat, with an expanded",100
NA,"immigration programme, it will be used",101
NA,"again. For that reason, i t is not intended",101
NA,to sell the buildings. The centre provides,101
NA,"accommodation for approximately 2,000",101
NA,persons. The Department of the Army,101
NA,"is using parts of it as a ""Women's Eoyal",101
NA,Australian Army Corps school and also,101
NA,part as a cadet training camp. The,101
NA,bonorable member need not be concerned,101
NA,"about the future of the buildings, as it is",101
NA,not intended to dismantle them and take,101
NA,them away.,101
Mr FRANCIS ,Moreton-Minister for,101
NA,the Army) [11.0] -Th e honorable,101
NA,member for Mallee ( Mr Turnbull),101
NA,and other persons wrote me a,101
NA,"letter about the Mildura camp, but",101
NA,as I received the communication only,101
NA,this morning it was not possible for me,101
NA,to answer it earlier. I give the honor-,101
NA,able meniber an assurance that there is,101
NA,no intention of interfering with the,101
NA,Women's Eoyal Australian Army Corps,101
NA,training centre at Mildura. Part of the,101
NA,camp is the head-quarters of the 3rd,101
NA,"Cadet Brigade, 1,200 members of which",101
NA,"are moving into camp to-night. That,",101
NA,portion of the establishment will regu-,101

Mr MENZIES ,Th e answers to the,101
NA,lionorable member's questions are as,101
NA,follows:-,101
NA,"1. £431,15!).",101
NA,2. The sale of the assets is not complete.,101
NA,The remaining Japanese assets in Australia,101
NA,"are estimated to realize £2°O,00O or there-",101
NA,abouts.,101
NA,3. Each former prisoner of war of the Japa-,101
NA,"nese has, or the dependants of those who died",101
NA,"while captive have, received a sum of £32.",101
NA,The total amount distributed in this way was,101
NA,"£093,000. This distribution was made possible",101
NA,by the provision of a Treasury advance of,101
NA,"approximately £400,000 pending realization of",101
NA,the assets. Tin's advance will be recouped as,101
NA,thc assets in Australia are realized.,101
NA,PAPER. 4. The progress made with respect to the,101
NA,disposal of Japanese assets in ex-enemy and,101
NA,neutral countries has not been satisfactory.,101
NA,"With thc other governments concerned, we",101
NA,have made approaches to the Japanese Go-,101
NA,vernment wliich has not been entirely helpful,101
NA,"in the matter. We are, however, hopeful that",101
NA,some finality will soon be reached. No moneys,101
NA,have yet been received from this source but an,101
NA,"amount of £75,306 sterling has been received",101
NA,representing the Australians' share in .he,101
NA,proceeds of the sale of the Burmn-Siam,101
NA,railway.,101
NA,questions 5 and 7. I t is not known what additional,101
NA,"a.mounts will be received. However, when",101
NA,the Government's decision was announced I,101
NA,indicated that if further funds were made,101
NA,available from the Tnternational Red Cross,101
NA,"e r , from Japanese assets in neutral countries' or",101
NA,"from any other Japanese source, the position",101
NA,will be given further consideration both in,101

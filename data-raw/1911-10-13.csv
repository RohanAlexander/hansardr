NA,TELEGRAPH OPERATORS' DISSATISFACTION,13
NA,-DANGEROU S TELEGRAPH POLES-,13
NA,COMMONWEALTH POSTAGE STAMPS.,13
Mr FINLAYSON ,Th e information,13
NA,has reached me that considerable dissatis-,13
NA,faction is felt by the telegraph operators,13
NA,"in the General Post Office at Brisbane, and",13
NA,it is stated in this morning's newspapers,13
NA,that a similar state of affairs prevails at,13
NA,"Sydney, the trouble being due to a regu-",13
NA,lation issued by the Public Service Com-,13
NA,missioner on the subject of broken time.,13
NA,Has the matter come under the notice of,13
NA,"the Postmaster-General, and,",13
NA,cause such inquiries' to be made as will,13
NA,satisfy the telegraphists that no unreason-,13
NA,able calls will be made on them in regard,13
NA,to hours?,13
Mr THOMAS ,Th e policy of the,13
NA,Government is to do away with broken,13
NA,"time as much as possible, and everything",13
NA,in reason will be done for the convenience,13
NA,"of the men in the service, but the public",13
NA,interest must be considered.,13
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Som e two years,13
NA,ago I drew attention to the very dangerous,13
NA,condition of some of the telegraph poles in,13
NA,"and about Melbourne, and I think a direct",13
NA,question on the subject was asked by the,13
NA,honorable member for Melbourne. I should,13
NA,now like to know whether the Postmaster-,13
NA,General's attention has been drawn to the,13
NA,"sad accidents to line repairers, and whether",13
NA,he is aware that some of the poles are in,13
NA,such a state that a stick or umbrella' can,13
NA,be pushed into them? Does the Postmaster-,13
NA,General intend to have a full report on the,13
NA,"subject, and to explain how it is that the",13
NA,poles have been allowed to remain in this,13
NA,state until repairers have met their death?,13
Mr THOMAS ,M y attention has been,13
NA,"called to the accidents, which we all regret",13
NA,very much. I must ask the honorable,13
NA,member to give notice of the other question,13
NA,he has asked.,13
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Ther e has been two,13
NA,years' notice of the question already.,13
Mr HIGGS ,Wil l the Postmaster-,13
NA,General depart from his usual practice of,13
NA,"asking for notice, and inform me what has",13
NA,been done with regard to the designs for,13
NA,Commonwealth postage stamps?,13
Mr THOMAS ,Application s for de-,13
NA,"signs were asked for, and an expert Board",13
NA,was appointed to judge them. I t made its,13
NA,"report, and although the Government does",13
NA,not bind itself to adopt the designs de-,13
NA,"clared by the Board to be the best, it has",13
NA,paid the prize money to those who sub-,13
NA,mitted them. We hold ourselves free to,13
NA,"adopt those, or any other designs.",13
NA,DIRECTOR OF PHYSICAL,13
NA,CULTURE.,13
Mr RYRIE ,Wil l the Minister repre.,13
NA,senting the Minister of Defence arrange for,13
NA,the laying on the table of all papers re-,13
NA,NA,13
NA,to the position of Director of Physical,13
NA,Culture ?,13
Mr FRAZER , I shall speak to the,13
NA,Minister on the subject. I do not think,13
NA,there will be any objection to the produc-,13
NA,"i f so, will he tion of the papers.",13
NA,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS.,13
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Wa s it not understood,13
NA,"yesterdav, when members consented to give",13
NA,up the time usually allotted to private,13
NA,"business, that the Government would later",13
NA,afford an opportunity for the discussion of,14
NA,that business? Will the Government afford,14
NA,that opportunity to-day?,14
Mr FISHER , I promised to give,14
NA,an opportunity for the discussion of,14
NA,"private business, and the promise will be",14
NA,kept. I did not think that the whole of,14
NA,yesterday's sitting would be occupied with,14
NA,the consideration of the Supply Bill.,14
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Whe n will an oppor-,14
NA,tunity be given for the consideration of,14
NA,private members' business?,14
Mr FISHER ,O n some occasion which,14
NA,will suit both the Government and private,14
NA,members.,14
NA,SMALL ARMS FACTORY.,14
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Wil l the Min-,14
NA,ister representing the Minister of De-,14
NA,fence arrange to place on the table a,14
NA,statement showing the exact position of,14
NA,affairs in connexion with the Small Arms,14
NA,Factory at Lithgow? A number of ques-,14
NA,"tions have been asked, and we should have",14
NA,"some definite information."" I want to know",14
NA,how much the contractors are behind their,14
NA,"time, and when finality will be reached.",14
Mr FRAZER ,I f tlie right honorable,14
NA,"member will ask definite questions, the Min-",14
NA,"ister will reply to them, and i f he is not",14
NA,"satisfied with the answers, I promise to",14
NA,make a statement during the consideration,14
NA,of the Estimates which I think will satisfy,14
NA,him.,14
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Whe n will the,14
NA,factory be finished?,14
Mr FRAZER ," I cannot say off-hand,",14
NA,but I shall obtain the fullest information.,14
NA,NORTHERN TERRITORY LIQUOR,14
NA,LICENCES.,14
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Wil l the Prime,14
NA,Minister have a return prepared showing the,14
NA,number of licences issued during the last,14
NA,three years for the sale of liquor in the,14
NA,"Northern Territory, and the dates of issue?",14
Mr FISHER ,Yes .,14
NA,FEDERAL CAPITAL.,14
Mr HIGGS , I want the Minister of,14
NA,Home Affairs to make it clear whether he,14
NA,has any intention of deciding himself to,14
NA,whom prizes shall be given in connexion,14
NA,with the designs submitted for the Federal,14
NA,Capital ?,14
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Certainl y following papers:-,14
NA,not. The position now is this: The,14
NA,"architects, whose work plays only a minor",14
NA,"part in town planning, wish me to bring an",14
NA,architect from England and another from,14
NA,America to form a Board to judge the de-,14
NA,"signs. We propose, however, to appoint",14
NA,a Board consisting of an Australian archi-,14
NA,"tect, an Australian engineer, and an Aus-",14
NA,"tralian surveyor, all members of Australian",14
NA,Institutes.,14
Mr FISHER ,Tha t Board will make re-,14
NA,commendations to the Government.,14
NA,"Mr KING O'MALLEY -Yes , and the",14
NA,Government's decision will be final. We,14
NA,are not going to appoint a Board forthwith.,14
NA,"I f we did, its members during the .next six",14
NA,or seven months would be chased and,14
NA,hunted by persons endeavouring to persuade,14
NA,them to give decisions which might not be,14
NA,right.,14
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Doe s the Min-,14
NA,ister consider that it is not the function of,14
NA,an architect to decide the location of a,14
NA,building ?,14
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Th e location,14
NA,of buildings will come later; then the archi-,14
NA,tects will be in their element.,14
Mr HIGGS ,I t is not clear to me what,14
NA,will happen after the Board has decided,14
NA,"that, in its opinion, certain designs are the",14
NA,best. Will the awarding of the prize or,14
NA,"prizes be left to the Board, or to the Min-",14
NA,ister ? I f the Minister or the Government,14
NA,"is to determine who shall get the awards,",14
NA,he or it will be the judge of the designs.,14
Mr FISHER ,Wheneve r an expert,14
NA,"Board is appointed to advise, .the final de-",14
NA,cision is with the Government. Some-,14
NA,"times two designs are held to be equal, or",14
NA,"nearly so, and the responsibility of choos-",14
NA,ing between them must rest with the Go-,14
NA,"vernment. I f a mistake is made, Parlia-",14
NA,ment can apply the corrective.,14
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Is the Minister,14
NA,of Home Affairs prepared to make a state-,14
NA,ment regarding the selection of the engineer,14
NA,and surveyor whom he proposes to appoint,14
NA,for the preliminary surveys and investiga-,14
NA,tions? Will he receive a nomination from,14
NA,"the Institute of Engineers, and another",14
NA,"from the Institute of Surveyors, or will",14
NA,he make appointments without consulting,14
NA,those bodies?,14
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -W e shall ask,14
NA,the Institutes to make nominations.,14

Mr JOHN THOMSON ,I n view of,15
NA,tlie frequent wrecks and fatalities on the,15
NA,"north coast of New South Wales, one of",15
NA,"which is reported only this morning, with",15
NA,"practically the loss of all hands, in addi-",15
NA,"tion to another a few weeks ago, with",15
NA,"even more disastrous results, will the Min-",15
NA,ister of Trade and Customs make inquiry,15
NA,"whether there are sufficient lighthouses, and",15
NA,whether proper appliances for saving life,15
NA,are provided?,15
Mr TUDOR ,The Commonwealth has,15
NA,"control of the lighthouses, but at the pre-",15
NA,set! t time the lighthouse expert is in quar-,15
NA,antine as passenger on a srnall-pox-infected,15
NA,vessel. New South Wales and the other,15
NA,States of Australia will be visited as soon,15
NA,"as possble, with a view to seeing that the",15
NA,:,15
NA,coast is properly lighted. As to the pro-,15
NA,"vision of life-saving appliances, and so",15
NA,"forth, the Commonwealth has not the",15
NA,slightest control.,15
Mr JOHN THOMSON ,Seein g that,15
NA,the lighthouses are under the control of the,15
NA,Mi-iister of Trade and Customs,15
Mr TUDOR ,No t yet.,15
Mr JOHN THOMSON ,I n view of,15
NA,the fact that the lighthouses will almost,15
NA,"immediately come under his control, will",15
NA,the Minister see that sn important a branch,15
NA,of the Public Service is not dependent on,15
NA,the chance of one officer being prevented,15
NA,"from performing his duty, even by being",15
NA,quarnnrined ?,15
Mr TUDOR ,The Lighthouses Bill is,15
NA,"not vet law, but I took the unusual course",15
NA,of nnpninting an officer in anticipation in-,15
NA,order to have inquiries made. This step,15
NA,"w'U. T think, result in the work being for-",15
NA,warded by at least twelve months.,15
NA,METEOROLOGICAL REPORTS.,15
Mr GROOM , the Minister of,15
NA,"Home Affairs, upon notice-",15
NA,"Whether he will inform this House what steps,",15
NA,"i f any, have been taken since December of last",15
NA,vear lo improve the transmission of meteoro-,15
NA,logical data by telegraph?,15
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Th e reply to,15
NA,Regulations the honorable member's questions is as,15
NA,follows:-,15
NA,"In January last, the Postmaster-General's De-",15
NA,No. 163. partment was asked to extend to the other,15
NA,States of the Commonwealth the system obtaining,15
NA,in New South Wales of transmitting data from,15
NA,"important country centres, and in August last",15
NA,ten additional rainfall stations were added to,15
NA,"the list in Queensland. I t was, however, in-",15
NA,timated that owing to congestion of telegraph,15
NA,lines in dealing with ordinary business no greater,15
NA,extension of free use of the lines could be,15
NA,"agreed to. The Meteorological Bureau is fully,",15
NA,seized of the importance of giving the greatest,15
NA,"publicity to weather information, and is con-",15
NA,stantly seeking the aid of any likely means of,15
NA,"distribution, but in view of the representations",15
NA,"of the Postal Department, that i t is not feasible",15
NA,"at present to further use the telegraph lines, for",15
NA,meteorological purposes a satisfactory solution ia,15
NA,difficult to arrive at. The Postmaster-General's,15
NA,Department estimates the annual value of ser-,15
NA,vices carried out on behalf of the Meteorological,15
NA,"Bureau at ^50,000.",15
NA,KALGOORLIE TO PORT,15
NA,AUGUSTA RAILWAY BILL.,15
NA,In Committee (Consideration resumed,15
NA,"from n t h October, vide page 1293):",15
NA,Clause 6-,15
NA,The Minister shall not be required to fence,15
NA,"any portion of the railway, but he may erect",15
NA,and maintain such fences in connexion therewith,15
NA,as he thinks proper.,15
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [10.51] - I desire,15
NA,"to call attention to a matter which, though",15
NA,"of comparatively minor importance, re-",15
NA,quires looking into. The clause means,15
NA,that i f it is not necessary throughout the,15
NA,great length of line to fence every part,15
NA,the Minister need not do so. In the State,15
NA,"Acts, however, provision is made for pro-",15
NA,"tecting the public by making level crossings,",15
NA,and so forth; and we should not con-,15
NA,struct this line without reserving to the,15
NA,public all the rights they have under State,15
NA,legislation. Section 18 of the Northern,15
NA,"Territory Act 1910, which, of course, is",15
NA,"not applicable to Western Australia, con-",15
NA,"tains a provision that the Commonwealth,",15
NA,"in the ""construction, maintenance, and",15
NA,"working"" of any railway required or",15
NA,authorized by the Act in South Australia,15
NA,shall be bound by the Railway Construc-,15
NA,tion Acts of the State and the laws re-,15
NA,lating to State railways to the same extent,15
NA,as the State is so bound. I notice that by,15
NA,"some oversight the word ""maintenance""",15
NA,"is left out of this Bill, and that the",15
NA,"word "" construction "" is not defined so as",15
NA,to include maintenance. ' Until we alter,15
NA,"the law we are, so far as South Australia",15
NA,"is concerned, subject to all the liabilities",15
NA,imposed on the Railway Commissioners of,16
NA,"that State, and those liabilities include the",16
NA,"provision of level crossings for stock, and",16
NA,so forth. I do not wish to move an,16
NA,"amendment, because that might embarrass",16
NA,"the Government, but merely draw attention",16
NA,to the matter so that it may be considered.,16
NA,Clause agreed to.,16
NA,Clause 7-,16
NA,Tlie Minister may utilize in the construction,16
NA,and working of the railway line engines worked,16
NA,by steam or other mechanical power.,16
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [10.55].,16
NA,-A n important question of policy may be,16
NA,involved in this clause. I t may be de-,16
NA,sired to use oil and other engines; and I,16
NA,should like to know whether it is the in-,16
NA,tention to import these or have them made,16
NA,"locally. I should like an assurance that,",16
NA,"as far as practicable, and, I hope, alto-",16
NA,"gether, the lengines will be constructed",16
NA,here.,16
Mr KING OMALLEY ,Darwin-Min -,16
NA,ister of Home Affairs) [10.56] - I can as-,16
NA,sure the honorable member that there will,16
NA,be no difficulty in that matter. This Go-,16
NA,vernment believes in doing everything pos-,16
NA,sible to promote Australian industries of,16
NA,every kind.,16
Mr FOWLER ,Perth) [10.57] -Wha t,16
NA,is the meaning and object of the clause?,16
NA,I t appears merely to indicate that the,16
NA,Minister may purchase or acquire cer-,16
NA,tain kinds of mechanical power in,16
NA,connexion with the construction and,16
NA,working of the line. I f i t means no,16
NA,"more than that, I am at a loss to under-",16
NA,stand why the clause is here.,16
NA,night the Prime Minister attempted to,16
NA,cast ridicule on an amendment provid-,16
NA,ing for the weight of rails; and it was at,16
NA,the same time suggested that the gradients,16
NA,and curves should be stated in the B i l l .,16
NA,"Such matters, to my mind, are much more",16
NA,"important than the fencing; in any case,",16
NA,we might take it for granted that the Min-,16
NA,"ister wili utilize engines, practically of any",16
NA,kind. Does the clause mean that when a,16
NA,particular engine is wanted the Minister,16
NA,"will not proceed to construct it, but pur-",16
NA,chase it in the usual way ?,16
- Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs) [10.59].,16
NA,"-Th e honorable member for Perth is, I",16
NA,"think, entitled to an answer.",16
NA,lic body desires to run an engine from,16
NA,"which sparks may cause damage, it is ne-",16
NA,cessary to obtain a general power to do,16
NA,so. Is this only a sort of skeleton Bill,16
NA,merely to adopt the policy of the construc-,16
NA,"tion of a line, or is it intended' to be a",16
NA,complete Bill? ' A great many accidents,16
NA,may be sustained by the public on rail-,16
NA,ways j and I should like some assurance,16
NA,that tlie Minister will see that the rights,16
NA,of the public and of the Commonwealth,16
NA,are properly safeguarded. I n the Rail-,16
NA,"ways Acts of the States, rights and duties",16
NA,"are completely defined; and this, as we",16
NA,"know, is the result of long experience.",16
NA,The honorable member for Angas has men-,16
NA,tioned that we considered these points in,16
NA,connexion with the negotiations for the,16
NA,transfer of the Northern Territory. In,16
NA,"the Act providing for the transfer, in sec-",16
NA,"tion 18, we declared that the laws of South",16
NA,Australia in relation to all these subjects,16
NA,should be binding on the Commonwealth.,16
NA,This provides for the one section in South,16
NA,"Australia, the remaining section should be",16
NA,as completely provided for. This is a tech-,16
NA,"nical subject, and it would, therefore, be",16
NA,unreasonable to expect the Minister to give,16
NA,us off-hand an authoritative answer; but,16
NA,I should like to have from him an assur-,16
NA,"ance that he will consult his advisers, and",16
NA,"that, i f necessary, such action will be taken",16
NA,in the Senate as will duly safeguard the,16
NA,interests of both the Commonwealth and,16
NA,the people generally.,16
Mr KING OMALLEY ,Darwin-Min -,16
NA,ister of Home Affairs) [11.2] - I would,16
NA,point out to tlie Committee that it may be,16
NA,found necessary to utilize different kinds,16
NA,"of mechanical power, and .that unless we",16
NA,took the power for which this clause pro-,16
NA,"vides, the Government might be held re-",16
NA,sponsible for damage arising from the,16
NA,The other use of a particular form of mechanism.,16
NA,I t might be urged in the Law Courts that,16
NA,we had no authority to use that kind of,16
NA,mechanism. We have already taken the,16
NA,very best legal advice available in the De-,16
NA,"partment, but i f anything further is neces-",16
NA,sary the Bill can easily be amended.,16
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Hindmarsh) [1.1.3].,16
NA,--Th e object of this clause is obviously to,16
NA,give the Government a general power to,16
NA,construct and use from time to time any,16
NA,mechanical power that may be necessary.,16
NA,I n the South Australian Railway Commis-,16
NA,sioners Act there is a section giving a gene-,16
NA,"ral power of construction and maintenance,",16
NA,and every Railway Bill submitted to the,16
NA,I f a pub- State Parliament contains a reference to,16
NA,that provision.,16
Mr FOWLER , ^ In clause 10 we take over,16
NA,that power.,16
Mr ARCHIBALD ,"Tha t may be, but",16
NA,it seems to me that i f we inserted a general,16
NA,power of that character in this measure we ;,16
NA,could have a reference to it in all future,17
NA,measures dealing with railway construction.,17
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [11.4] - I under-,17
NA,"stand that the Minister has said, in - reply",17
NA,to the honorable member for Darling,17
NA,"Downs, that, i f necessary, a further Act",17
NA,"will be passed, and a measure will cer-",17
NA,tainly have to be passed eventually on the,17
NA,lines of the South Australian Railway Com-,17
NA,missioners Act in order to give the powers,17
NA,to which reference has been made.,17
NA,"subsequent clause of this Bill, however,",17
NA,covers a good deal of the matters to which,17
NA,attention has been called.,17
NA,Clause agreed to.,17
NA,Clause 8 (Provision for incidental mat-,17
NA,ters).,17
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [11.5] -Th e hon-,17
NA,orable member for Fremantle a day or two,17
NA,ago drew attention to the fact that in this,17
NA,Bill no power is taken to run the rolling-,17
NA,stock of the Commonwealth over the Wes-,17
NA,tern Australian lines.,17
Mr HEDGES ,Notic e of an amendment,17
NA,dealing with that matter has been given.,17
NA,Mr KING 0'MA.IXE.Y -Ther e is a pro-,17
NA,posed new clause.,17
Mr GLYNN ,Ver y well; I had,17
NA,drafted an amendment dealing with the sub-,17
NA,ject.,17
NA,Clause agreed to.,17
NA,Clause 9 (Incidental buildings ancl,17
NA,works).,17
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [11.6] -Th e,17
NA,whole tenor of this Bill generally is to place,17
NA,unlimited power in the hands of the Min-,17
NA,"ister. I t is a bad practice, more especially",17
NA,in a Bill dealing with the spending of,17
NA,"public money, to ' confer on a Minister",17
NA,powers such as are covered by this measure.,17
NA,This clause provides that-,17
NA,The Minister may erect or make all such sta-,17
NA,"tions, buildings, approaches, bridges, culverts,",17
NA,"apparatus, dams, tanks, plant, works, conveni-",17
NA,"ences, and structures as he considers necessary",17
NA,or desirable in connexion with the efficient con-,17
NA,struction and working of the railway.,17
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e unfortunate part of,17
NA,"this clause is that ""Minister"" is defined",17
NA,"as meaning the "" Minister of Home",17
NA,"Affairs.""",17
Mr KELLY ,Th e Minister ought not,17
NA,to want to run the construction show. In,17
NA,"a measure of this kind, there should be",17
NA,some authority vested with the actual con-,17
NA,"struction of the railway, so that i f the esti-",17
NA,mates are exceeded we shall be able to pin,17
NA,down a particular officer.,17
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Th e House will,17
NA,"be able to pin down the Minister, and he,",17
NA,"in turn, will pin down the officer con-",17
NA,cerned.,17
Mr KELLY , I doubt whether I have,17
NA,the capacity to pin the Minister to any-,17
NA,thing. He is the most agile person under,17
NA,criticism that I have met. Why should,17
NA,this tremendous power be given? A Min-,17
NA,ister with wild-cat notions-h e might not,17
NA,be the present Minister,17
Mr BRENNAN ,Tha t is the point; it,17
NA,A might be the Government.,17
Mr KELLY ,I t might be another Go-,17
NA,vernment altogether.,17
Mr BRENNAN ,W e have to take the,17
NA,risk.,17
Mr KELLY , I feel my responsibility,17
NA,to the country in regard to the expenditure,17
NA,"of public funds, and desire, as far as pos-",17
NA,"sible, to safeguard the people against ex-",17
NA,travagance. The Minister will have power,17
NA,"under this clause to do almost anything,",17
NA,and the Consolidated Revenue will be,17
NA,charged with the cost of all his adventures.,17
NA,"I suggest to the honorable gentleman that,",17
NA,"before we reach the third-reading stage,",17
NA,some step should be taken to safeguard the,17
NA,Commonwealth against possible contin-,17
NA,gencies in this direction.,17
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [ n . 10] - I,17
NA,understand that items to provide for the,17
NA,building of a railway will be included from,17
NA,"time to time in the Estimates, so that when",17
NA,"those Estimates are submitted, a discussion",17
NA,can take place on points such as those men-,17
NA,tioned by the honorable member for Went-,17
NA,worth. I t would be ridiculous to so limit,17
NA,the wording of this clause as to make it,17
NA,possible for the work to be suddenly held,17
NA,up-perhap s whilst Parliament was in re-,17
NA,cess-owin g to the Minister having insuffi-,17
NA,cient power to deal with some trifling mat-,17
NA,ter that was not specifically mentioned in,17
NA,"the Act. To my mind, the only possible",17
NA,way of providing for such a great work as,17
NA,this is to give the Minister practically un-,17
NA,limited power as to details.,17
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [1r.11] -,17
NA,The honorable member for Cook cannot,17
NA,have read the Bill. Clause 19 provides,17
NA,that-,17
NA,A l l moneys necessary for the payment of the,17
NA,cost of construction of the railway . . . .,17
NA,. shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue,17
NA,Fund or out of any moneys standing to the,17
NA,"credit of the Loan Fund, and the Consolidated",17
NA,Revenue Fund and the Loan Fund are hereby,17
NA,appropriated for that purpose accordingly.,17
NA,We are now dealing with the whole busi-,17
NA,ness relating to the construction of this,17
NA,"railway, and it is the fact that we shall",17
NA,not be called upon to deal with it on the,17
NA,Estimates that makes me particularly,18
NA,anxious to see embodied in the Bill proper,18
NA,safeguards against extravagance.,18
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Richmond) [11.12] -,18
NA,In support of what the honorable member,18
NA,"for Wentworth has said, I would point out",18
NA,that we have no plans and specifications,18
NA,before us.,18
Mr JH CATTS ,Doe s,18
NA,member think that the House should deal,18
NA,with the plans and specifications for,18
NA,railway ?,18
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Mos t certainly. Honlar,18
NA,orable members who have had experience,18
NA,the New South Wales Parliament tell,18
NA,that they have never known a Railway Bill,18
NA,to be introduced without being accompanied,18
NA,by plans and specifications of the lines,18
NA,"which it applied. That, I am assured,",18
NA,is the invariable practice there.,18
Mr HALL ,Tha t is not correct.,18
Mr MASSYGREENE ," I certainly think,",18
NA,"more particularly as, I believe, it is the",18
NA,intention of the Government to construct,18
NA,"this railway by day labour, that, before",18
NA,we finally give the Minister these wide,18
NA,"varied powers, and also vote the whole",18
NA,"the money necessary for the work, we",18
NA,"should, at least, have from him an assurtime",18
NA,ance as to the manner in which he is going,18
NA,to spend the money. There is a great deal,18
NA,in the point raised the other day by the,18
NA,"honorable member for Perth, at the request",18
NA,"of the honorable member for Fremantle,",18
NA,regard to the weight of rails to be used.,18
NA,There is a possibility of our wasting a,18
NA,great deal of money by adopting too light is,18
NA,a type of rail. The maintenance of this,18
NA,line is going to be' a very heavy burden.,18
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Why ?,18
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Becaus e the men will fications.,18
NA,be cut adrift from all centres of civiliza-,18
NA,tion. They will have to work under condiregard,18
NA,tions anything but pleasant during the,18
NA,"greater part of the year, and they will",18
NA,probably require payment accordingly.,18
NA,"do not think that this, or any other Parliaon,",18
NA,"ment, would begrudge them high wages",18
NA,uncler such conditions.,18
Mr JH CATTS ,Bu t maintenance,18
NA,a question of traffic.,18
Mr MASSYGREENE ,No t altogether. The,18
NA,"honorable member for Fremantle, who",18
NA,thoroughly acquainted with all the details,18
NA,"of this class of work, will inform the",18
NA,"mittee, I am sure, i f he has recovered",18
NA,"voice, that i f we used a heavy rail we",18
NA,should not have to spend half as much in,18
NA,maintenance as we should have to do,18
NA,we used a light rail.,18
Mr JH CATTS ,I t will make very,18
NA,little difference unless there is heavy traffic.,18
Mr MASSYGREENE ,N o doubt the honor-,18
NA,"able member for Cook is, in his own esti-",18
NA,"mation, a better authority than the honor-",18
NA,able member for Fremantle. The latter is,18
NA,very strong upon this point.,18
Mr HEDGES ,Th e Minister gave a,18
NA,the honorable satisfactory reply.,18
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e Minister said he,18
NA,"this would do what he thought best, but he",18
NA,did not commit himself to any particu-,18
NA,"weight of rail, nor have we been fur-",18
NA,in nished with any particulars as to the way,18
NA,me in which the money is to be expended.,18
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [11.16].,18
NA,-Th e honorable member for Richmond,18
NA,to need not be apprehensive as to the effect,18
NA,of the adoption of day labour in the con-,18
NA,struction of the line. In Victoria lines are,18
NA,being constructed now on the day-labour,18
NA,principle far cheaper than used to be the,18
NA,"case under the contract system, and I be-",18
NA,lieve that this is also true of New South,18
NA,Wales. The contractors' profits are being,18
NA,"and cut out, and the Governments of the day",18
NA,of and the workers themselves are obtaining,18
NA,the benefits which the contractors at one,18
NA,used to secure. I t is perfectly right,18
NA,that the Committee should make every pos-,18
NA,sible inquiry as to how far the Minister in-,18
NA,tends to go in exercising the great powers,18
NA,conferred by the measure. I hope the,18
NA,in Government will adopt in the construction,18
NA,"of the line the day-labour system, which",18
NA,"being employed in the States, and thereby",18
NA,save considerable sums to the Common-,18
NA,wealth.,18
Mr MASSYGREENE , I am not objecting to day,18
NA,labour. I object to. the absence of speci-,18
Mr CANN ,Nepean) [11.17] - I do not,18
NA,this clause as the final word in con-,18
NA,nexion with the management of the rail-,18
NA,way. The Minister must have large powers,18
NA,I conceded to him at the present stage. Later,18
NA,"when the line is working, probably the",18
NA,preponderance of feeling in the House and,18
NA,amongst the people will be in favour of the,18
NA,is appointment of a Commission to manage,18
NA,the railway. Until then it would hamper,18
NA,the Minister i f we gave him anything short,18
NA,"is of the powers conceded in the Bill, even",18
NA,though some honorable members may re-,18
NA,Comgard them as a little dangerous. In the,18
NA,"his New South Wales Parliament, as far as I",18
NA,"know, the most that has ever been submitted",18
NA,in regard to the construction of a new line,18
NA,i f is the plan of the route and the recom-,18
NA,mendation of the Public Works Committee.,18
NA,That information is all that we could rea-,19
NA,"sonably expect in connexion with this line,",19
NA,and it has already been supplied. The,19
NA,honorable member for Richmond has been,19
NA,misinformed as to the practice in other,19
NA,Parliaments.,19
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [11.19].,19
NA,-Th e weight of rail is a matter,19
NA,upon which the engineers are so,19
NA,thoroughly agreed that no difficulty,19
NA,need be apprehended. The engineers will,19
NA,be able to determine the weight of rail re-,19
NA,quired for the class of traffic on this line.,19
NA,I do not think that there will be found to,19
NA,be any variation between the views of any,19
NA,of the railway engineers of Australia on,19
NA,fhe point. As to the question of mainten-,19
NA,"ance, the traffic will be comparatively light",19
NA,for some time to come. The line,19
NA,will have to be cut up into lengths,19
NA,convenient for patrol and inspection,19
NA,"by men stationed at different points,",19
NA,and no man will have a greater length,19
NA,to look after than he can cover on,19
NA,his tricycle in a day. That will be suffi-,19
NA,"cient for some time to come, and so the",19
NA,maintenance will be placed upon a certain,19
NA,"minimum basis. As the traffic increases,",19
NA,the line will have to be more heavily bal-,19
NA,"lasted, and the number of men spread",19
NA,along the route will have to be increased.,19
NA,I do not think that in the early days of the,19
NA,line the question of the poundage of rail,19
NA,will have any material effect on the cost,19
NA,of maintenance.,19
Mr RYRIE ,North Sydney) [11.21] -,19
NA,I am surprised at honorable members op-,19
NA,"posite "" stone-walling "" the measure. The",19
NA,amendment to specify the weight of,19
NA,"rail was lost, and therefore the disserta-",19
NA,tion of the honorable inember for Cook was,19
NA,unnecessary. The question of the mainten-,19
NA,ance of the line is a matter for officialdom,19
NA,after the work of construction is com-,19
NA,pleted. Honorable members opposite,19
NA,"are hampering the Minister and "" stone-",19
NA,"walling "" the measure by indulging",19
NA,in absolutely unnecessary talk. I do,19
NA,not believe in wasting the time of the,19
NA,country. Ministerial supporters seem to be,19
NA,determined not to allow the measure to pro-,19
NA,ceed any further in Committee. There is,19
NA,nothing contentious in the Bill until we,19
NA,reach clause 18. Why not let the interven-,19
NA,"ing clauses pass, as they are all a matter",19
NA,ofform? The Bill has been drafted by,19
NA,men who know more about the subject,19
NA,"than do honorable members opposite, and",19
NA,in the orthodox manner in which all rail-,19
NA,way construction Bills are drafted.,19
Mr WISE ,I t is not; that is just the,19
NA,-defect -,19
Mr RYRIE , I see no innovation in it.,19
NA,It is quite right that the powers here speci-,19
NA,"fied should be given to the Minister, and I",19
NA,hope honorable members opposite will cease,19
NA,to obstruct.,19
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [11.23] -,19
NA,The honorable member for. North Sydney,19
NA,has hardly done justice to the honorable,19
NA,member for Cook and others opposite. It,19
NA,is true that the measure is somewhat peace-,19
NA,"ful down to clause 15, but the present is a",19
NA,"time of extreme crisis, and it is necessary",19
NA,for grave national reasons that honorable,19
NA,members opposite should show themselves,19
NA,active in the supervision of public business.,19
NA,Those gentlemen are now facing a crisis in,19
NA,their careers. Any one of them may be,19
NA,"chosen, and it is only right that the most",19
NA,exhaustive criticisms of public measures,19
NA,should at this stage emanate from them.,19
NA,I can see no other reason why they should,19
NA,make such earnest bids at this juncture.,19
NA,As one who is anxious to see the course of,19
NA,"this measure made easy and placid, my",19
NA,sympathies are entirely with the honorable,19
NA,"member for North Sydney, but as a",19
NA,humanitarian and one who realizes how in-,19
NA,tolerable it is to repress an overweening,19
NA,"ambition, my sympathies go out to my hon-",19
NA,orable friends opposite.,19
NA,Clause agreed to.,19
NA,Clause 10-,19
NA,For the purposes of the construction and worki,19
NA,"ing of the railway, the Minister shall have and",19
NA,"may exercise in the State of South Australia, all",19
NA,the powers and authorities vested in the Govern-,19
NA,"ment of that State, or any authority of that",19
NA,State by any State Act relating to railway con-,19
NA,struction or working to the same extent as i f the,19
NA,"railway were a State railway, and the Minister",19
NA,were the proper State authority for the construc-,19
NA,tion and working thereof.,19
Mr WISE ,Gippsland) [ 1 1 . 2 5 ] - T h i s,19
NA,is one o f those unsatisfactory clauses which,19
NA,I suppose we must put up with because the,19
NA,Bill is merely a skeleton. The powers and,19
NA,authorities taken ought to be limited to,19
NA,those existing at the date of the passing of,19
NA,this measure. VVe do not know what the,19
NA,"existing powers are, and the State Parlia-",19
NA,ment may add to them from time to time.,19
NA,The Northern Territory Acceptance Act,19
NA,provided for the assumption of the powers,19
NA,as existing at the date of the agreement.,19
NA,I suggest that the clause be amended by,19
NA,"inserting after the word "" authorities,"" the",19
NA,"words "" at the date of the passing of this",19
NA,"Act.""",19
- Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [11.26] -Th e,19
NA,honorable member for 'Gippsland is quite,19
NA,right in saying that in the Northern Ter-,20
NA,ritory Agreement Act the powers assumed,20
NA,were limited to those existing at the date of,20
NA,"the-agreement, but to allay anxiety I may",20
NA,"state that, as draftsman of the South Aus-",20
NA,"tralian Bill, I went through every section",20
NA,of the South Australian legislation that,20
NA,"could affect our powers, and, with the re-",20
NA,"presentative of the Commonwealth, com-",20
NA,pared them in Melbourne. He was satis-,20
NA,fied at that date that the taking over of the,20
NA,powers as they existed then would involve,20
NA,no harm or risk. I do not think any change,20
NA,"has taken place since, but i f there is any",20
NA,obnoxious difference we can amend the Act.,20
Mr HALL ,Th e objection of the hon-,20
NA,orable member for Gippsland is that some-,20
NA,thing may take place subsequently.,20
Mr GLYNN ,I f that is the objection,20
NA,we could bring this measure into line with,20
NA,the Northern Territory Acceptance Act by,20
NA,limiting the powers and authorities to those,20
NA,existing at the date of its passage.,20
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [11.28] -,20
NA,The Minister might reasonably tell the,20
NA,Committee what are the powers and authori-,20
NA,ties vested in the South Australian Govern-,20
NA,ment. The next clause hands over the,20
NA,powers and authorities vested in the,20
NA,Western Australian Government.,20
NA,Committee ought to know whether they are,20
NA,the same in both States. I t might be more,20
NA,convenient to take over equal powers in,20
NA,"both cases, so that our officers when pass-",20
NA,ing over the border may know exactly how,20
NA,far their authority extends. Otherwise,20
NA,there may be all sorts of legal difficulties,20
NA,"between State ancl State, in connexion with",20
NA,an inter-State line such as this undoubtedly,20
NA,is. Clauses 10 and n may be found to be,20
NA,in conflict.,20
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin -,20
NA,Minister of Home Affairs) [11.29] -,20
NA,The clause provides for taking power in,20
NA,South Australia in connexion with the con-,20
NA,struction of the railway. Many special,20
NA,"powers may have to be exercised, such as",20
NA,"the opening or closing of roads, the utiliza-",20
NA,"tion of brivate premises for storage, the",20
NA,"dealing with trespasses on property, &c.",20
Mr KELLY ,Ar e the powers the same,20
NA,in South Australia and Western Australia?,20
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -W e take over,20
NA,the Western Australian powers in a subse-,20
NA,quent clause. When they cross the border,20
NA,"line, our officers will know i f there",20
NA,Bs any difference in their powers.,20
NA,A man must conform to the laws of the,20
NA,State the moment he crosses its borders.,20
NA,We desire to obtain the same rights and,20
NA,powers that the Minister of Raihvays has,20
NA,"or may have in South Australia, and the",20
NA,Minister of Railways has or may have in,20
NA,Western Australia.,20
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [n.31] -I t,20
NA,seems to me that until the Commonwealth,20
NA,has a generalRailway Act similar to the,20
NA,"State Acts, it will be necessary to have",20
NA,clauses like this in its construction Acts.,20
NA,No doubt we shall have a general Act,20
NA,"before very long. In the meanwhile, the",20
NA,point raised by the honorable member for,20
NA,Gippsland deserves the serious consideration,20
NA,of the Government. Not only does the,20
NA,clause confer on the Minister all the powers,20
NA,given to the Minister of Railways of South,20
NA,"Australia under existing Acts, but also all",20
NA,the powers that may be given to him under,20
NA,Acts which may be passed after this measure,20
NA,becomes law. That means that South Aus-,20
NA,tralia will be in a position to determine the,20
NA,conditions under which this railway shall,20
NA,be constructed and maintained. In fram-,20
NA,"ing the Bill, the departmental officers had",20
NA,access to the existing legislation of South,20
NA,"Australia, and were able to make them-",20
NA,"selves acquainted with its effect, but they",20
NA,did not know what the future legislation,20
NA,"of the State may be. Members, too, can",20
NA,The inform themselves of the existing South,20
NA,"Australian law, and may be quite willing to",20
NA,"adopt it, but they are in the dark as to the",20
NA,"future legislation of the State, which might",20
NA,be quite contrary to their view of what is,20
NA,proper for the Commonwealth. Perhaps,20
NA,the Minister will have the matter looked,20
NA,"into, and, i f necessary, provide for the",20
NA,amendment of the clause when the Bill is,20
NA,before the Senate.,20
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [11.35] -,20
NA,I do not know i f the Government have en-,20
NA,"tered into ""negotiations with the Govern-",20
NA,ment of South Australia on this subject.,20
NA,I f we take all the powers of the State,20
NA,"authorities, shall we not need the assistance",20
NA,of State officers to give effect to them ?,20
Mr JH CATTS ,Othe r Acts provide,20
NA,for that.,20
Mr FENTON ,Ca n we say that the,20
NA,"Acts of a State shall apply, or must we",20
NA,have the' consent of the State to make sure,20

Mr FOWLER ,Perth) [11.36] -A t no,20

Mr GROOM ,Th e Minister has given,21
NA,notice of an amendment.,21
NA,Clause agreed to.,21
NA,Clause 12-,21
NA,The Minister may make by-laws for the,21
NA,"lation, government, protection, and working",21

NA,"the State of South Australia, and may, i f he control.",21
NA,"thinks fit, adopt, with modifications, the by-laws",21
NA,relating to the Western Australian State Rail-,21
NA,ways so far as concerns any part,21
NA,in the State of Western Australia.,21
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [11.38] -Th e operate,21
NA,"clause empowers the Minister to make bycase,",21
NA,"laws for the regulation, government, proadopting",21
NA,"tection, and working of the railways. In",21
NA,the State Acts such by-laws are subject,21
NA,the control of Parliament. In the South,21
NA,"Australian Act of 1887, with which I",21
NA,"fairly familiar, because I drafted it,",21
NA,vision is made that fares may be fixed by,21
NA,by-laws. There is a series of provisions,21
NA,"regarding regulations, and both by-laws",21
NA,and regulations are subject to Parliamentary,21
NA,"control; in other words, Parliament may,",21
NA,"after they have been laid on the table, dis-",21
NA,allow them on the presentation of an ad-,21
NA,dress to the Government. I think that we,21
NA,should provide for similar Parliamentary,21
NA,control.,21
Mr RILEY ,Th e principle would apply ing,21
NA,also in clause 14.,21
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Th e by-laws,21
NA,have to be laid on the table of Parliament. should,21
Mr GLYNN ,Bu t Parliament has no for,21

NA,notice has been given at any time within,21
NA,fifteen sitting days after they were laid,21
NA,"fore it, disallowing the regulation, it shall",21
NA,cease to have effect. With the Minister's,21
NA,"permission, I shall therefore move-",21
NA,That the following words be added :-,21
NA,by-laws shall be deemed regulations within,21
NA,meaning of section 10 of the Acts Interpretation,21

Mr GLYNN ,Claus e 14 must also be in any Bill of the kind.,21
NA,amended.,21
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs) [11.42].,21
NA,- I hope that the amendment will be,21
NA,cepted. I asked the Minister to look into,21
NA,"tlie matter, and have a clause drafted to",21
NA,"deal with it, and he promised to do so.",21
NA,"Mr KING O'MALLEY -Ther e is no ob-""",21
NA,jection to laying the regulations on the,21

Mr GROOM ,Wha t is desired is that,21
NA,reguParliament should have the power to dis-,21

NA,"force the administration of their Departments,",21

NA,with the State authorities in each,21
NA,"and we seem to have power to do so,",21
NA,such South Australian and West-,21
NA,ern Australian regulations as we may think,21
NA,to good. That does not prevent us from mak-,21
NA,ing uniform regulations of our own i f,21

NA,"proried, our railways will be under the con-",21
NA,"trol of a Minister who, i f he is like the",21

NA,he might be a malevolent one.,21
NA,Mr j . H . CATTS (Cook) [11.45] -Th e,21
NA,point raised by the honorable member for,21

NA,object to handing over the power provided,21

NA,is a provision that by-laws and regulations,21

Mr HALL ,Doe s tlie honorable mem-,22

Mr GLYNN ,Tha t point occurred to,22

NA,for all purposes.,22
Mr HALL ,Ther e might be a Senate,22

Mr GLYNN , Does that not apply,22

NA,"This House controls the purse, and i f we",22
NA,passed a resolution declaring that a parti-,22

NA,"other place, subject to our check, to make",22
NA,suggestions.,22
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [11.50] -,22
NA,Would it not be wiser to delete this clause?,22
NA,Without such a clause it would be neces-,22
NA,sary for the Government to introduce a,22
NA,Railway Bill to govern the whole matter,22
NA,of the railways as we were nearing the,22
NA,"completion of the construction, whereas,",22
NA,with the clause we are inserting in a purely,22
NA,"construction measure, we should have a pro-",22
NA,"vision regarding rates and so forth, which",22
NA,ought really to be in such a general Bill as I,22
NA,have suggested. The power given by the,22
NA,clause will not be required until the line,22
NA,is practically constructed.,22
Mr FOWLER ,Perth) [n.51] -Wil l,22
NA,the Minister have power under this clause,22
NA,to enter into an arrangement with the State,22
NA,"railway authorities as to a through rate,",22
NA,"say, from Fremantle to Adelaide? I f",22
NA,"sitting, some such power is not definitely given,",22
NA,and one rate is to be charged from Fre-,22
NA,"mantle to Kalgoorlie, another across the",22
NA,"alleged desert, and a third from Port",22
NA,"Augusta to Adelaide, the efficiency of the",22
NA,railway will be very much impaired.,22
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min -,22
NA,ister of Home Affairs) [11.53]-- I a S K,22
NA,the,22
NA,honorable member for Angas not to press,22
NA,"this amendment. I f , later on, any altera-",22
NA,tion is considered advisable we can easily,22
NA,recommit the Bill. I am sure the Com-,22
NA,mittee does not desire to do anything to,22
NA,cripple this financial project. We do not,22
NA,know what may happen in the future.,22
NA,"This is a line of 1,060 miles, through coun-",22
NA,try which is at present remote from civili-,22
NA,zation ; and I advise the honorable member,22
NA,"to withdraw the amendment, with a view",22
NA,to consultation later on.,22
Mr WEST ,East Sydney) [11.54] - I,22
NA,do not agree with the honorable member,22
NA,"for Wentworth, because I'think that, while",22
NA,"the line is in course of construction, it will",22
NA,be necessary for the Minister to have some,22
NA,power to fix rates and fares.,22
- Mr KELLY , I am inclined to think that,22
NA,"is so, but this power proposed is a very",22
NA,extended one.,22
Mr WEST ,Th e regulations will be,22
NA,"laid on the table of both Houses, and the",22
NA,House will know exactly what the Min-,22
NA,ister has done in the conduct of the,22
NA,railway.,22
Mr ARCHIBALD ,Hindmarsh) [11.55].,22
NA,- I do not think there is any danger in,22
NA,the point raised by the honorable member,22
NA,for Perth as to through rates. We have,22
NA,already given to the Minister all the powers,22
NA,possessed and exercised by the Railways,22
NA,Commissioners of South Australia and,22
NA,"Western Australia, so that there will be",22
NA,no difficulty in arriving at an agreement as,22
NA,"to through fares. This clause, in my",22
NA,"opinion, is very desirable, though it seems",22
NA,to me that the Bill is very strangely,22
NA,"drafted. For that, however, I do not",22
NA,"blame the Government so much, because",22
NA,manv things have tc be provided for in,22
NA,this Bill which would be more properly,22
NA,provided for in a general Bill creating,22
NA,"some authority for the construction, main-",22
NA,"tenance, working-for , indeed, the whole",22
NA,of the business connected with the line.,23
NA,A week ago the Government informed us,23
NA,that they did not think it desirable at pre-,23
NA,"sent to create such an authority, because",23
NA,they were anxious to push on with this,23
NA,"construction B i l l . Until, however, the time",23
NA,"arrives when a general Bill is necessary,",23
NA,we are bound to have a clause of this,23
NA,character in the present B i l l .,23
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [11.58] -Th e,23
NA,argument of the honorable member for,23
NA,"East Sydney is a very fair one, but I",23
NA,think it goes too far. The clause provides,23
NA,that the Minister may charge such fares,23
NA,and rates as he thinks reasonable; but I,23
NA,ask what passenger is going out into the,23
NA,centre of the desert until the line is a,23
NA,through line?,23
Mr HALL ,Peopl e may go along for,23
NA,the purpose of selling clothes to those en-,23
NA,gaged in the work of construction.,23
Mr KELLY ," T h a t is possible, but",23
NA,surely it is much more likely,23
NA,a representative of the Commonwealth,23
NA,Clothing Factory will travel free over,23
NA,the Government railway! Apart from,23
NA,"such trifles as have been suggested,",23
NA,the necessity for such a provision,23
NA,cannot arise until the line is practically,23
NA,completed or close upon completion.,23
NA,admit there is some necessity for a clause,23
NA,"of the kind, and the case might be met",23
NA,i f the Minister assured us that a general,23
NA,railway Bill will be submitted next,23
NA,-session.,23
Mr LAIRD SMITH ,Thi s clause gives us,23
NA,control over the Minister.,23
Mr KELLY ," I t gives us no control,",23
NA,for never yet have honorable members had,23
NA,any practical chance of ventilating the ques-,23
NA,tion of regulations in this House. I t is only,23
NA,when grave differences arise between par-,23
NA,ties that we have an opportunity to ventilate,23
NA,matters i n the House. A matter may be,23
NA,"o f importance to a particular member, but",23
NA,"not to a party as a whole, and in such cir-",23
NA,cumstances it cannot be threshed out. This,23
NA,clause provides that a schedule of fares,23
NA,and rates made by the Minister shall be,23
NA,laid before both Houses of Parliament,23
NA,"within thirty days after the making thereof,",23
NA,"i f Parliament is then sitting, and i f it is not",23
NA,"-sitting, within thirty days after the next",23
NA,meeting of the Parliament; so that tbe,23
NA,schedule prepared by the Minister might be,23
NA,six or eight months old before we had a,23
NA,chance to deal with it .,23
NA,"Mr HF.DGF.S -An d a good thing, too.",23
Mr KELLY , F r o m the honorable,23
NA,"member's point of <view, perhaps; but,",23
NA,"after all. this is a sovereign Parliament,",23
NA,and i t . is entitled to exercise the power,23
NA,pf supervision over this railway until,23
NA,it is placed under Commissioners. . I f,23
NA,the Minister will give us an assurance that,23
NA,he will have the matter placed on a sure,23
NA,"basis before this Parliament expires, that is",23
NA,all I can reasonably ask.,23
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -I t w i l l be care-,23
NA,f u l l y considered.,23
Mr KELLY , T h e Minister will take,23
NA,this question into his careful considera-,23
NA,tion?,23
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Yes .,23
Mr HALL ,Werriwa) [12.2] -A s to the,23
NA,point raised by the honorable member for,23
NA,Perth regarding the power of the Minister,23
NA,"to make a through rate, I do not think that",23
NA,the clause as it stands would enable him,23
NA,to do so. I trust that the honorable mem-,23
NA,ber for Angas will not insist upon his,23
NA,that amendment to incorporate in the Bill sec-,23
NA,tion 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act,23
NA,of 1904. That section provides that where,23
NA,"an Act .confers power to make regulations,",23
NA,all regulations made accordingly shall he,23
NA,"notified in the Government Gazette,- that",23
NA,they shall take effect from the date of,23
NA,I notification; that they shall be laid before,23
NA,both Houses of Parliament; and that-,23
NA,if either House of the Parliament passes a reso-,23
NA,lution of which notice has been given at any,23
NA,time within fifteen sitting days after such regu-,23
NA,lations have been laid before such House disal-,23
NA,lowing any regulation such regulation shall,23
NA,thereupon cease to have effect.,23
NA,This clause gives the Minister power to,23
NA,frame a schedule of fares and rates.,23
Mr WEST ,Will not the Government be,23
NA,compelled to publish those rates and fares,23
NA,in the Government Gazette f,23
Mr HALL ,Ther e is no objection to,23
NA,"that, but i f the amendment were adopted it",23
NA,would give the Senate the right to disallow,23
NA,"that schedule by resolution when, perhaps,",23
NA,the whole of the Ministry and the whole of,23
NA,the members of this House were favorable,23
NA,to it . The position would he that the,23
NA,Senate would have a power over the finances,23
NA,to which it is not entitled.,23
Mr GLYNN ,"Then , would the honorable",23
NA,member give the House of Representatives,23
NA,this power? I recognise that regulations,23
NA,"under other Acts do not deal with finance,",23
NA,whereas the schedule to which this clause,23
NA,relates would do so.,23
Mr HALL ,Sinc e the schedule would,23
NA,"deal with finance, the proposed power",23
NA,should be confined to the House of Repre-,23
NA,sentatives.,23
Mr WEST ,Th e Senate could not over-,24
NA,ride the decision of the House of Repre-,24
NA,sentatives.,24
Mr HALL ,I t could if this amend-,24
NA,ment were carried.,24
Mr GROOM ,Wh y not allow the exist-,24
NA,ing law to stand ?,24
Mr HALL , I think that we are fairly,24
NA,protected by the clause as it stands. It is,24
NA,for the Minister to say whether or not he is,24
NA,prepared to accept the amendment j but I,24
NA,trust that he will at least so limit it as to,24
NA,retain for this House the power to control,24
NA,"rates and fares, instead of conferring on",24
NA,either House the power to disallow a de-,24
NA,cision of the Government in relation,24
NA,thereto.,24
Mr HEDGES ,Fremantle) [12.5] -,24
NA,It is very desirable that this clause should,24
NA,remain in the Bill. The honorable mem-,24
NA,ber for Wentworth said that whilst the line,24
NA,was being constructed nothing would be,24
NA,carried over it. He is evidently not aware,24
NA,of the fact that sheep and other stations,24
NA,extend for hundreds of miles over the coun-,24
NA,"try to be traversed, and that freight would",24
NA,"be carried for them. Then, again, who",24
NA,knows what discoveries may be made,24
NA,during the construction of the railway?,24
NA,The line will pass through the Tarcoola,24
NA,"gold-field, and it will carry everything re-",24
NA,quired for that and other gold-fields that,24
NA,may be discovered. Whilst the railway,24
NA,from Southern Cross to Kalgoorlie was,24
NA,"being constructed, the traffic upon it in-",24
NA,creased to such an extent that something,24
NA,like six engines were required to cope with,24
NA,"it, apart altogether from the power re-",24
NA,quired to haul the material for construction,24
NA,- purposes. The Minister must have full,24
NA,"power to make these rates, and to vary",24
NA,them according to circumstances. In the,24
NA,"event of a serious drought, sheep and cattle",24
NA,Would have to be removed from one place,24
NA,"to another, and the Minister should be",24
NA,given power so to alter rates as to be able,24
NA,promptly to meet such an emergency.,24
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs) [12.8] -,24
NA,I hope that the Minister will accept the,24
NA,"amendment, as moved by the honorable",24
NA,member for Angas.,24
Mr KING OMALLEY , I have already,24
NA,"sa'id that I cannot accept it. I promised,",24
NA,"however, that the matter would be con-",24
NA,sidered later on and said i f it were,24
NA,"then thought desirable to deal with it, we",24
NA,osuld if necessary re-commit the Bill.,24
Mr GROOM ,Fro m the point of view,24
NA,"of Parliamentary control, this is an exceed-",24
NA,ingly important matter. Under the amend-,24
NA,"ment, both Houses would, i f necessary,",24
NA,have the right tq protest against the sche-,24
NA,dule of rates and fares adopted by the,24
NA,"Minister, so that we are simply asking for",24
NA,the preservation of Parliamentary control.,24
NA,"With one exception, I do not think that",24
NA,any regulation framed by a responsible,24
NA,"Minister, acting under proper advice, has",24
NA,ever been disallowed by either House of,24
NA,the Commonwealth Parliament. The ex-,24
NA,ception referred to was a regulation framed,24
NA,by the present Minister of Home Affairs in,24
NA,"regard to the collection of the census, and",24
NA,which was rejected by the Senate. We,24
NA,should be very careful not to give up our',24
NA,"Parliamentary control, and I hope that the",24
NA,Minister will accept this amendment.,24
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY - I cannot.,24
Mr GROOM ,Th e legislation of South,24
NA,Australia is generally noted for its preser-,24
NA,vation of the rights of the State Parlia-,24
NA,ment. In section 37 of the South Aus-,24
NA,tralian Act power is given to the Commis-,24
NA,sioner to make by-laws fixing the amount,24
NA,of fares for the conveyance of passengers,24
NA,"and the charges for the carriage of animals,",24
NA,"goods, and parcels. It provides further,",24
NA,"however, that such by-laws shall be laid",24
NA,before both Houses of Parliament within,24
NA,"fourteen days of their making, and that i f",24
NA,an address be presented to the Governor,24
NA,by either House they may be annulled.,24
NA,That is what we are asking for. We are,24
NA,"asking, not for the introduction of any",24
NA,"revolutionary principle, but for the recog-",24
NA,nition of an existing system. When the,24
NA,"definition clause was under consideration,",24
NA,I asked the Minister of Home Affairs,24
NA,whether the rates and fares fixed by the,24
NA,Minister should not be submitted to Par-,24
NA,"liament, and the honorable gentleman, act-",24
NA,"ing on his first impulses, which are gene-",24
NA,"rally the impulses cf statesmanship, said-",24
NA,""" I have not the slightest objection to doing",24
NA,"that when the occasion arises.""",24
Mr KING OMALLEY , I have really,24
NA,provided for what I promised would be,24
NA,done.,24
Mr GROOM ,Th e honorable member,24
NA,has not done so. I f we delegate these,24
NA,"powers to the Minister, he will be able",24
NA,"to exercise them just as he thinks fit, and",24
NA,unless we can pass a Bill through both,24
NA,Houses we shall be unable to secure re-,24
NA,dress.,24
Mr JH CATTS ,O r pass a motion of,24
NA,censure.,24
Mr GROOM ,Eve n that would not be,24
NA,sufficient. It would only lead to the mis-,24
NA,fortune of depriving us of the services of,24
NA,"the Minister. We want to remove, not the",25
NA,"Minister himself, but that which is objec-",25
NA,tionable in any schedule or regulation.,25
NA,"amendment should be accepted. I f ,",25
NA,"further consideration, it was thought to",25
NA,"too drastic, it could be reconsidered.",25
NA,Minister could ask the Parliamentary,25
NA,Draftsman to consider how it harmonized,25
NA,with the whole scheme of his Bill.,25
NA,would be much better for the Minister,25
NA,accept the amendment than to reject i t,25
NA,and be compelled at a later stage,25
NA,for the recommittal of the Bill.,25
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [12.14] -,25
NA,The proviso to this clause that these,25
NA,dules of fares and rates shall be laid,25
NA,the table of the House is absolutely insuffiis,25
NA,cient to meet the position. Under it schethat,25
NA,"dules would be laid on the table, and",25
NA,"should have power to look at them., but",25
NA,we could not cause them to be disallowed,25
NA,unless Ave carried a motion that would,25
NA,tantamount to a motion of censure.,25
NA,such a. motion the matter would be decided,25
NA,"on party lines, quite irrespective of the",25
NA,merits of the schedule itself. I recognise,25
NA,the force of the objection raised to,25
NA,"amendment, that it would give the Senate",25
NA,co-equal power with this House to veto,25
NA,schedule of rates and fares; but we could,25
NA,"add words providing for all that the honHouses,",25
NA,orable member for Angas has in view withthe,25
NA,out going so far as to incorporate in this measure.,25
NA,measure the provisions of section 10 of the,25
NA,Acts Interpretation Act of 1904. I would,25
NA,suggest that the following words be added,25
NA,to sub-clause 2 :-,25
NA,Within which period the House of Representa-,25
NA,"tives may, by resolution, vary or rescind",25
NA,any of such schedules.,25
NA,Would I be in order in moving an amendamendment,25
NA,ment upon the amendment ?,25
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e honorable,25
NA,member had better wait until the other,25
NA,amendment is disposed of.,25
Mr JH CATTS ,Perhap s the words,25
NA,I have suggested will not quite meet the case.,25
NA,I will give notice of intention to move,25
NA,"add to sub-clause 2 a proviso that "" the",25
NA,House of Representatives may within fiftempts,25
NA,teen days after the tabling of the schedule,25
NA,by resolution vary all or any portion of,25
NA,It would not be proper to give any Minister,25
NA,unlimited power over so important a matter.,25
NA,The power that I am asking for is conallow,25
NA,"served to all the State Parliaments, and",25
NA,is absolutely necessary when we are comdifficulty,25
NA,mencing a Commonwealth railway policy simply refuse to pass the Act.,25
NA,to preserve similar powers for the,25
NA,monwealth Parliament.,25
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [12.17].,25
NA,-Th e difficulty might be overcome i f the,25
NA,The Minister would consult his colleagues to,25
NA,upon see if an amendment can be drafted to,25
NA,be suit the objections that have been raised.,25
NA,The It would be unwise at this stage to accept,25
NA,the amendment of the honorable member,25
NA,"for Angas, or that of the honorable mem-",25
NA,I t ber for Cook. I t would be satisfactory i f,25
NA,to the Minister would promise to make a state-,25
NA,", . ment to the House later on, and, i f neces-",25
NA,"to ask sary, recommit the clause.",25
Mr BRENNAN ,Batman) [12.18] -,25
NA,The objection to the suggestion of the,25
NA,schehonorable member for Cook is that under,25
NA,on it one House may veto a regulation which,25
NA,sanctioned by the other. In a case of,25
NA,kind the remedy would lie in the in-,25
NA,"we troduction and passage of an Act, and we",25
NA,should reach then exactly the same position,25
NA,as we are in now. The honorable member,25
NA,be for Cook objects that when the schedules,25
NA,On are laid before both Houses members can,25
NA,do nothing but look at them. Our remedy,25
NA,is exactly the same as we should have in the,25
NA,last resort if the amendment of the honor-,25
NA,the able member for Angas were adopted-,25
NA,"namely, that we should have to deal with",25
NA,a the matter by passing an Act. In the event,25
NA,of a clash of opinions between the two,25
NA,the matter has to be dealt with in,25
NA,proper way by the introduction of a,25
Mr JH CATTS , I do not propose to,25
NA,give the other House any authority in the,25
NA,matter.,25
Mr BRENNAN ,Bot h Houses have,25
NA,"all or absolute power in the matter, and may",25
NA,"exercise it in the last resort, whether the",25
NA,of the honorable member for,25
NA,Angas is carried or whether the clause goes,25
NA,through as it stands at present.,25
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [12.20] - I see no,25
NA,way out of the difficulty unless the pro-,25
NA,vision I suggest is put in. Otherwise we,25
NA,shall have absolutely no power to check the,25
NA,to rates. An Act of Parliament has nothing,25
NA,"to do with it, because an Act immediately",25
NA,the Senate to interfere. They have,25
NA,a perfect right under the Constitution to,25
NA,"i t . "" intervene by resolution. I would prefer",25
NA,that they did not have the same ipower as,25
NA,"we have over these things, but if we do not",25
NA,"them to do it by resolution, and a",25
NA,"it deadlock results, we cannot get over the",25
NA,"by an Act, because they will",25
NA,In the,25
NA,"ComSouth Australian Railways Act, as the",25
NA,honorable member for Darling Downs,25
NA,"pointed out, there is an express provision",26
NA,on the lines of my amendment. All fares,26
NA,"must be laid on the table of the House,",26
NA,and may be disallowed by the specific re-,26
NA,solution of either House. We have based,26
NA,our Constitution on the South Australian,26
NA,"practice, and the Senate holds in the matter",26
NA,of finance exactly the same relation to this,26
NA,House as the South Australian Legislative,26
NA,Council holds to the South Australian,26
NA,House of Assembly.,26
Mr FENTON ,Wil l not this proposal,26
NA,give the Senate power to disallow all these,26
NA,regulations by resolution?,26
Mr GLYNN ,"Undoubtedly , but i f we",26
NA,"do not pass the amendment, we shall have",26
NA,no power over the schedules of fares and,26
NA,rates at all. 1 recognise the force of,26
NA,the argument of the honorable member for,26
NA,"Cook, that it would be inadvisable even",26
NA,indirectly to give the Senate by our legis-,26
NA,"lation power to check these charges, but",26
NA,if we put in a limitation to the effect that,26
NA,it is to be done by the House of Repre-,26
NA,"sentatives only, we immediately tempt the",26
NA,Senate to kick up a row on a practically,26
NA,irrelevant matter. I do not want to block,26
NA,a Bill about which I am not very enthu-,26
NA,"siastic, and therefore I would advise hon-",26
NA,orable members to follow the course laid,26
NA,"down in 1904, and not to precipitate a dis-",26
NA,pute with the Senate about a measure,26
NA,which they are particularly anxious to pass.,26
NA,"I f the Minister thinks it better, after",26
NA,"sultation with the Drafting Department, to",26
NA,throw both these clauses into some other,26
NA,"shape, I am sure the Committee will facili-",26
NA,"tate the re-draft in every way, but at pre-",26
NA,"sent, following what has been done in",26
NA,South Australia in a perfectly analogous,26
NA,"case, his best course is to adopt my amend-",26
NA,ment. Without it this House will have,26
NA,no check over the charges at all.,26
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin -,26
NA,Minister of Home Affairs) [12.25J -,26
NA,I suggest that the Committee pass,26
NA,the Bill as it stands now. We have,26
NA,had the best opinion of the Law Depart-,26
NA,"ment on its drafting, and our desire is to",26
NA,rarry out this project economically and,26
NA,efficiently. I do not want to have any-,26
NA,thing in the measure which will in any way,26
NA,cripple it.,26
Mr GROOM ,Thi s is simply a question,26
NA,of policy.,26
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -I f it is con-,26
NA,"sidered advisable, we can recommit the",26
NA,Bill and have the proposal re-drafted.,26
Mr GROOM ,I t is not a question of,26
NA,technical drafting; it is a question of,26
NA,whether Parliament shall keep control.,26
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Th e Bill has,26
NA,to be successfully administered by this Go-,26
NA,"vernment, and we do not want anything in",26
NA,it that will make it possible to cripple the,26
NA,whole project.,26
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [12.26] -,26
NA,After hearing the honorable member for An-,26
NA,gas I am prepared to vote for his amend-,26
NA,ment. Whilst my proposal would perhaps,26
NA,establish the supremacy of the House of Re-,26
NA,presentatives in a financial matter of this,26
NA,"kind, it might raise in the Senate some",26
NA,difficulty that would be really to the detri-,26
NA,ment of the measure. Rather than that,26
NA,"-should happen, I would prefer the amend-",26
NA,ment of the honorable member for Angas.,26
NA,I am absolutely strong on the point that,26
NA,unlimited power should not be given to,26
NA,"any Minister, Labour or Conservative, to",26
NA,fix rates and fares. Parliament must re-,26
NA,tain authority to review the matter.,26
Mr BRENNAN ,Th e only difference is,26
NA,that the Bill as it stands gives Parliament,26
NA,"control, and the honorable member wants",26
NA,to reserve the power to one House.,26
Mr JH CATTS ,Th e Bill does not,26
NA,"give control to Parliament. Sub-clause 2""",26
NA,simply provides that the schedule shall be,26
NA,"laid on the table, which means that we may",26
NA,come here and look at it.,26
Mr BRENNAN , I t throws the whole,26
NA,confield open for Parliament to deal with.,26
Mr JH CATTS ,Onl y by the pas-,26
NA,sing of a vote of censure on the Govern-,26
NA,ment. The matter of rates and fares,26
NA,"mav be of great importance, but the mem-",26
NA,bers of a party may not feel inclined to,26
NA,turn the whole Government out on it. I,26
NA,want to see provision made in the measure,26
NA,for Parliament to deal with the question,26
NA,as a non-party one. The only way to,26
NA,secure that is to direct that the schedule,26
NA,"shall be laid on the table, and that Par-",26
NA,liament shall have an opportunity of veto-,26
NA,"ing or varying it within a certain period,",26
NA,just as is now done in the case of regula-,26
NA,tions in connexion with all the Government,26
NA,Departments.,26
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs) [12.28].,26
NA,-Al l that we ask is that these by-laws,26
NA,shall be deemed to be regulations within,26
NA,the meaning of the Acts Interpretation Act,26
NA,"of 1904, which provides that, wherever the",26
NA,"word ""regulation"" is mentioned in an",26
NA,Act of Parliament the following procedure,26
NA,shall apply: The regulations have to be,26
NA,"notified in the Gazette, they take effect",26
NA,"from the date of the notification, and they",27
NA,are to be laid before both Houses of Par-,27
NA,liament within thirty days of their mak-,27
NA,"ing, or i f Parliament is not then sitting,",27
NA,"within thirty days after its next meeting,",27
NA,"but that, i f either House at any time with-",27
NA,in fifteen sitting days after the regulations,27
NA,have been laid before the House pass a,27
NA,"resolution of which notice has been given,",27
NA,"disallowing any regulation, such regulation",27
NA,shall thereupon cease to have effect. That,27
NA,applies to every regulation made where the,27
NA,power to make regulations is conferred by,27
NA,ah Act. All that we ask in this instance,27
NA,-th e Minister has already accepted it as,27
NA,regards the general by-laws in a previous,27
NA,clause-i s that as regards railway rates,27
NA,and fares the by-laws shall be deemed to,27
NA,be regulations. Then those provisions re-,27
NA,lating to regulations will apply. The effect,27
NA,will be that the regulations will have the,27
NA,"force of law, unless within fifteen days of",27
NA,their being laid before Parliament either,27
NA,House passes a resolution disagreeing to,27
NA,them.,27
Mr FISHER , I have no objection to,27
NA,providing that the by-laws must be made,27
NA,by the Governor-General in Council.,27
Mr GROOM , I do not think that that,27
NA,is going far enough. The clause as framed,27
NA,makes the Minister a despot. He can fix,27
NA,"what rates he pleases, and lay them on the",27
NA,"table, but Parliament cannot disallow them.",27
NA,The regulations fixing the fees in the,27
NA,Patents and Trade-marks Departments have,27
NA,"to be laid on the table, and the same prac-",27
NA,tice should be adopted in this case.,27
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay-Prim e Min-,27
NA,ister and Treasurer) [12.32] -I f the hon-,27
NA,orable member for Angas will consent to,27
NA,withdraw his amendment. I have an amend-,27
NA,ment to move in the first line of the clause.,27
NA,"Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",27
Mr FISHER ,Th e amendment which,27
NA,I wish to propose reads as follows: -,27
NA,"That the word "" Minister,"" line 1, be left",27
NA,with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words,27
NA,""" Governor-General in Council.""",27
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [12.34] -I t would,27
NA,be wise to give the Committee an oppor-,27
NA,tunity to think over the amendment which,27
NA,I proposed. There may be a difference of,27
NA,opinion as to whether .the Senate should,27
NA,"have the power to disallow regulations,",27
NA,but I am. afraid that i f any limitation on,27
NA,its power is inserted it will not be agreed,27
NA,to. I should like Ministers to consider my,27
NA,"proposal, and i f they decide not to accept",27
NA,"it, to give an opportunity to test the feeling",27
NA,of the Committee in regard to it.,27
NA,Clause postponed.,27
NA,Clause 15-,27
NA,The Minister may appoint all such officers as,27
NA,he thinks necessary for the purposes of the con-,27
NA,"struction or working of the railway, and may",27
NA,authorize the employment of any persons for,27
NA,those purposes.,27
Mr GROOM ,"Darling Downs) [12.36],",27
NA,-Wil l the Minister give us an explanation,27
NA,of this clause ? I t allows him to appoint all,27
NA,such officers as he thinks necessary for the,27
NA,"construction or the working of tlie railway,",27
NA,and to authorize the employment of any per-,27
NA,son for these purposes. Similar provisions,27
NA,were inserted in the draft Census and Sta-,27
NA,tistics Bill and the draft Meteorological,27
NA,"Bill, but were withdrawn because the Pub-",27
NA,lic Service Act regulates the appointment of,27
NA,"officers. Under the Bill as it stands, the",27
NA,Minister could enter into a life contract in,27
NA,appointing an officer. There is no restric-,27
NA,tion on his power of appointment. This,27
NA,appears to conflict with the prin-,27
NA,ciple of the Public Service appoint-,27
NA,ments laid down in the Act. In,27
NA,"the appointment of permanent engineers,",27
NA,"for example, the usual practice should be",27
NA,"followed. An office should be created, the",27
NA,"vacancy advertised, all candidates should",27
NA,"be tested, and the applicants best fitted",27
NA,"should be appointed. So, too, with ac-",27
NA,"countants, clerks, and the like. As for tem-",27
NA,"porary hands, their appointment, again,",27
NA,"is provided for in the Public Service Act,",27
NA,and provision is made for waiving its limi-,27
NA,"tations, i f necessary. I t must be remem-",27
NA,bered that persons appointed under the Act,27
NA,have their rights and privileges. But the,27
NA,"Bill would, apparently, enable the crea-",27
NA,tion of a new Public Service without de-,27
NA,fined status.,27
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min -,27
NA,ister of Home Affairs) [12.40] -Th e Bill,27
NA,provides purely for the construction of the,27
NA,"railway, but passengers and goods will be",27
NA,carriecl on the line before it is handed over,27
NA,"out, by the constructing authority to the man-",27
NA,aging authority. I t is not intended fo,27
NA,"create a large permanent staff, because it",27
NA,may be that the Commonwealth will not,27
NA,undertake another work of this kind for,27
NA,"some time, and may not need again the men",27
NA,employed on it. I f the Public Service,27
NA,Commissioner had to be consulted about the,27
NA,"dismissal of one man, or the choice of an-",27
NA,"other, it would hamper operations very",27
NA,much. Such procedure would be very,27
NA,unbusinesslike. The Engineer-in-Chief will,27
NA,"be responsible to the Minister, but in turn",27
NA,"will control his immediate officers, who will",27
NA,direct those below again.,27
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Franklin) [12.43].,28
NA,"-Ther e is no need for the clause, and",28
NA,hope that the Minister will consent,28
NA,being negatived. The Public Service Act this matter.,28
NA,leaves to the Minister the right to appoint,28
NA,temporary hands without reference to the,28
NA,Commissioner. We know that as soon as partment.,28
NA,the line is connected with a centre of,28
NA,"lation, passengers and goods will be carand",28
NA,"ried on it, and a staff will be necessary",28
NA,manage the traffic. A traffic inspector,28
NA,would not be appointed merely to control,28
NA,the traffic during the time that the line,28
NA,"under construction, to be dismissed on",28
NA,completion. When the work nears comtaken,28
NA,"pletion, a traffic branch and a permanentto",28
NA,way branch will be just as necessary,28
NA,"later on, when it is in full running order.",28
NA,The best men available should therefore be fessional character.,28
NA,"appointed in the first instance, and in their",28
NA,appointment the provisions of the Public,28
NA,Service Act should apply. The temporary,28
NA,hands needed only for the construction,28
NA,the work can be appointed without reference,28
NA,to the Public Service Commissioner. TemPublic Service Act?,28
NA,porary hands are so employed now in con-,28
NA,"nexion with telegraph repairing, the conrepeal",28
NA,"struction of roads, and other works. I f",28
NA,"the clause is carried as it stands, there may",28
NA,ultimately be a serious conflict between,28
NA,Minister and the Public Service Commishere,28
NA,"sioner, unless men are temporarily appointed",28
NA,to what will be really permanent positions.,28
NA,The only result can be direct and serious,28
NA,conflict between the Minister in charge,28
NA,what may be called temporary works and officers also?,28
NA,"the. Public Service Commissioner, who,",28
NA,"until the Act is repealed, must have control",28
NA,of the permanent appointments. TJnder poses of this Bill.,28
NA,the Public Service Act the heads of the,28
NA,Departments who represent the Minister,28
NA,have full and complete power,28
NA,"temporary appointments, and I do not",28
NA,think it advisable that a Minister should,28
NA,make permanent appointments so long as,28
NA,the Public Service Commissioner is vested,28
NA,with the authority. This clause will not move-,28
NA,give the Minister any more power than he,28
NA,"possesses now, nor will it take from the",28
NA,Commissioner any of the authority he now in,28
NA,has. I t has been found necessary to withworked;,28
NA,draw similar clauses in two or three Supply,28
NA,"Bills previously before us, and any conflict hours.""",28
NA,between the Construction Department and,28
NA,the Commissioner can be to the interests of,28
NA,neither the service nor the Minister.,28
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [12.46] - I,28
NA,agree with the policy laid down in the ter?,28
NA,"olause, which vests, in the Minister or",28
NA,subordinate officers control of the employes.,28
NA,"The scheme of the Public Service Act is,",28
NA,"I in my opinion, absolutely ridiculous.",28
NA,"to its Mr KING O'MALLEY -Hear , hear, in",28
Mr JH CATTS ,"I n any matter,",28
NA,because it divides responsibility in the De-,28
NA,Recommendations made by,28
NA,poputhose in charge in relation fo wages,28
NA,"conditions, or the qualifications of",28
NA,"to persons employed, may be "" turned",28
NA,"down"" by the Commissioner, who has",28
NA,absolutely no responsibility whatever in the,28
NA,was conduct of the Departments. I know of,28
NA,its instances where the Commissioner has,28
NA,up an attitude in entire opposition,28
NA,the official charged by this Parliament,28
NA,as and Government with the successful con-,28
NA,duct of work of a highly technical and pro-,28
NA,"That being so, the",28
NA,sooner Parliament gets rid of the rotten,28
NA,idea that the Commissioner should be en-,28
NA,abled to veto the recommendations of re-,28
NA,of sponsible officials the better.,28
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Wh y not repeal the,28
Mr JH CATTS ,Thi s clause will,28
NA,the Act so far as the railway is con-,28
NA,"cerned ; indeed, that appears to be the ex-",28
NA,the pressed intention. I f the clause were not,28
NA,the appointments would rest entirely,28
NA,"with the Commissioner, but the power is",28
NA,transferred to the Minisrer.,28
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Woul d the honor-,28
NA,of able member make that apply to permanent,28
Mr JH CATTS, I would make it,28
NA,apply to any person employed for the pur-,28
Mr BRENNAN , I think it is very doubt-,28
NA,ful whether this clause will transfer the,28
NA,to make all power to the Minister.,28
NA,Mr JH . CATTS -O f course there,28
NA,are differences of opinion on the matter.,28
NA,I desire to provide for the observance of,28
NA,"certain conditions as to employment, and",28
NA,That the following words be added to the,28
NA,"clause :- "" Provided that the recognised work-",28
NA,"ing hours shall not exceed 48 per week, unless",28
NA,"cases of emergency, when overtime may be",28
NA,and provided also that the minimum,28
NA,rate of wages shall not be less than Ss. for eight,28
Mr HALL ,Fo r adult labour?,28
Mr JH CATTS ,Yes ; that can be,28
NA,provided i f desired.,28
Mr RILEY ,Canno t we trust the Minis-,28
Mr JH CATTS ," A little while ago,",28
NA,when the question of a minimum wage,28
NA,"was before us, the then Minister prac-",29
NA,tically insulted me on the floor of,29
NA,Parliament when I asked for a rate of,29
NA,7s.; and I desire this matter of wages to,29
NA,be placed beyond the power of any Minis-,29
NA,ter. In the Railway Departments of the,29
NA,"various States, from nine to twelve hours a",29
NA,"day are being worked regularly, and when",29
NA,we ask that an eight hours' day shall be,29
NA,"provided for, we are told by the Commis-",29
NA,"sioners that because there are 30,000 men",29
NA,employed-a s in New Soutli Wales-th e,29
NA,"reform will cost ^£150,000 or ^250,000.",29
NA,The Commissioners express their sympathy,29
NA,with the idea of an eight hours' dav. a,29
NA,"minimum wage, and one day's rest in",29
NA,seven; but when it is suggested that a re-,29
NA,"form, to which I am sure the public would",29
NA,"readily assent, should .be carried out, we",29
NA,are told that the extra cost would throw the,29
NA,finances of the State Departments into,29
NA,chaos.,29
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Wh y not,29
NA,away repeal the Public Service Act ?,29
Mr JH CATTS , I candidly admit,29
NA,that it is my desire to do so in the case of,29
NA,"the railways. I f we lay down, at a com-",29
NA,"mencement, that the week's work shall con-",29
NA,"sist of 48 hours, we shall have no trouble",29
NA,in the future. As the honorable member,29
NA,"for Franklin has pointed out, this railway",29
NA,"will be built in sections, and doubtless each",29
NA,section as completed will be worked. Men,29
NA,"will be required for the permanent way,",29
NA,"locomotives, and so forth, and they may in",29
NA,the beginning be permanently appointed.,29
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,The y should be.,29
Mr JH CATTS ,Furthe r it is pos-,29
NA,sible that the contractors may open the line,29
NA,temporarily for traffic.,29
Mr MASSYGREENE ,I s this work going to be,29
NA,done by contract?,29
Mr JH CATTS , I do not know,29
NA,"whether that question has been decided, but",29
NA,"if the work, as it should be, is done by day",29
NA,"labour, sections of the line will be opened",29
NA,on a temporary basis j and I have no doubt,29
NA,that the men employed at first will even-,29
NA,tually receive permanent appointments. I,29
NA,do not know that it is necessary to per-,29
NA,manently appoint them the moment they,29
NA,"are taken on, because some probationary",29
NA,period may be desirable.,29
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,I t would be much,29
NA,fairer to make their appointments per-,29
NA,manent from the beginning.,29
Mr JH CATTS ,Quit e so; I have,29
NA,a great objection to temporary appointments,29
NA,"for permanent work. However, that point",29
NA,"need not be discussed at length just now.,",29
NA,"We have an opportunity now, at the com-",29
NA,"mencement of the work, when few practical",29
NA,"difficulties present themselves, to lay down",29
NA,"the maximum working hours, and the mini-",29
NA,"mum wage, though, of course, I have not",29
NA,"provided for eight hours each day, as the",29
NA,exigencies of the traffic may require broken,29
NA,time. A minimum of 8s. a day has been,29
NA,laid down by the Minister for permanent,29
NA,work in his Department.,29
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Fo r temporary,29
NA,work it pays 9s. a day.,29
Mr JH CATTS ,Tha t is in the case,29
NA,"of men who work broken time, but tem-",29
NA,porary employes who are constantly em-,29
NA,ployed are paid 8s. I t may be that the,29
NA,"cost of living will increase, and 8s. may not",29
NA,"prove a living wage, so that the matter will",29
NA,have to be subject to reconsideration.,29
Mr WEST ,I t is a bad thing to fix a,29
NA,"minimum wage, because it has a tendency",29
NA,straight to become the maximum.,29
Mr JH CATTS ,Tha t is often the,29
NA,"way in the case of private employment, but",29
NA,it does not apply to Government employ-,29
NA,ment.,29
Mr WEST ,Wh y make the provision ?,29
Mr JH CATTS ,Becaus e I desire,29
NA,to see nothing less paid. Thousands of,29
NA,men are working for the Commonwealth at,29
NA,7s. a day.,29
Mr CANN ,Me n are working on the,29
NA,New South Wales railways at less than 8s.,29
Mr JH CATTS ,Thousand s were,29
NA,"working for less than 7s., but I am glad",29
NA,to see that the latest Wages Board has fixed,29
NA,the minimum rate for unskilled labour at,29
NA,"8s. for eight hours. Unhappily, in some",29
NA,"of the States, there are men working for as",29
NA,low a wage as 6s. and 7s. a day of eight,29
NA,"hours; and, while we should like to see the",29
NA,"rate a little higher than I have suggested,",29
NA,it is well to lay down a minimum. I hope,29
NA,tlie principle will be affirmed in an Act of,29
NA,"Parliament, because that will not only do",29
NA,"good in the Commonwealth service, but",29
NA,will have a wholesome effect on the various,29
NA,services of the various States.,29
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay-Prim e Mini-,29
NA,ster and Treasurer) [12.59] -Th e Govern-,29
NA,ment have no objection at all to the princi-,29
NA,"ple embodied in the proposal, but we think",29
NA,that it would be better contained in a,29
NA,separate clause.,29
NA,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,29
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Richmond) [2.15] -,29
NA,"The honorable member for Cook, just be-",29
NA,"fore we adjourned for dinner, expressed",29
NA,pleasure that the appointments under this,30
NA,clause would not come under the operation,30
NA,of the Public Service Act. I wish to point,30
NA,"out, however, that many of these appoint-",30
NA,ments will in their very nature be of a,30
NA,permanent character. Probably before we,30
NA,have completed this railway other raihvays,30
NA,"in the Northern Territory will be projected,",30
NA,"and many of these appointments, i f made,",30
NA,will go on automatically for a very long,30
NA,time. I am not speaking of casual la-,30
NA,"bourers, because under the Public Service",30
NA,Act there is ample power to employ all the,30
NA,casual labour that will be required for the,30
NA,actual construction of the line. I am,30
NA,speaking rather of appointments to the en-,30
NA,"gineering, construction, and clerical staffs,",30
NA,"which will be, to all intents and purposes,",30
NA,of a permanent character.,30
Mr FISHER ,W e propose to limit them.,30
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Howeve r short may be,30
NA,the limitation that the Prime Minister pro-,30
NA,"poses to impose upon them, should not",30
NA,these employes automatically come under,30
NA,some form of control that is removed from,30
NA,political influence? I understand that the,30
NA,policy of this Parliament from the first,30
NA,has been to take the permanent employes,30
NA,of the Commonwealth out of Ministerial,30
NA,"control, and to place them under an inde-",30
NA,pendent control where they are free from,30
NA,political interference and political interests.,30
NA,Officers engaged in the construction of this,30
NA,line will automatically be transferred to,30
NA,"the other works to which I have referred,",30
NA,and there ought to be some definite provi-,30
NA,sion that the officers whom the Minister,30
NA,may appoint under this clause shall be,30
NA,placed under the operation of the Public,30
NA,"Service Act, or a Bill should be passed",30
NA,providing for their control by Railway,30
NA,"Commissioners. I f that is not done, the",30
NA,door will be opened wide to political in-,30
NA,fluence. From the point of view of honor-,30
NA,"able members on all sides of the House, it",30
NA,it undesirable that our Public Service,30
NA,should be exposed to political patronage.,30
NA,I should like to know exactly the nature,30
NA,of the limitation which the Prime Minister,30
NA,proposes to impose.,30
Mr FISHER ,W e propose to limit the,30
NA,appointments under this clause to a term,30
NA,not exceeding six months beyond the date,30
NA,of the opening of the line.,30
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e construction of,30
NA,"the line may occupy some years, and it is",30
NA,"not fair even to the Ministry, or to those",30
NA,"public servants who will be engaged, to ex-",30
NA,pose the service during that time to poli-,30
NA,tical patronage.,30
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [2.20] -A s,30
NA,I understand that the Government are pre-,30
NA,pared to accept the principle of my amend-,30
NA,"ment, i f it be embodied in a separate",30
NA,"clause, I ask leave to withdraw roy amend-",30
NA,"ment, so that I may submit at a later stage",30
NA,a clause dealing with the matter.,30
NA,"Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",30
NA,Amendment (by Mr KING O'MALLEY),30

NA,"That after the word "" appoint,"" line 1, the",30
NA,"words "" for any period not extending six",30

Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [2.23] -,30
NA,"Before this line is completed, it will be",30
NA,necessary to engage a number of perma-,30
NA,nent employe's.,30
Mr FISHER ,W e shall have power to,30
NA,do that under this proviso.,30
Mr FENTON ,Th e Government are,30
NA,taking power under the amendment to limit,30
NA,the term of employment of those at pre-,30
NA,sent engaged to not more than six months,30
NA,after the completion of the line.,30
Mr FISHER ,"Tha t is to say, the Minis-",30
NA,ter cannot continue indefinitely the employ-,30
NA,ment of men so engaged. In the mean-,30
NA,time we shall pass an Act dealing with the,30
NA,whole matter.,30
Mr FENTON , I believe it will be,30
NA,necessary to make permanent appointments,30
NA,prior to the completion of the line. I,30
NA,presume that in connexion with the appoint-,30
NA,ment of the chief officials required either,30
NA,for the construction of the line or the super-,30
NA,"vision of the railway, applications will be",30
NA,publicly invited-tha t we shall follow the,30
NA,course pursued in connexion with the recent,30
NA,appointment of a Land Tax Commissioner,30
NA,and an Engineer for the Northern Terri-,30
NA,tory. That should get over the difficulty,30
NA,raised by the honorable member for Dar-,30
NA,"ling Downs, who said that in order to re-",30
NA,move this matter wholly beyond Minis-,30
NA,terial control the appointment nf offirers,30
NA,should be placed under the Public Service,30
NA,"Commissioner. I am not arguing for that,",30
NA,but I do urge that when it is proposed to,30
NA,make permanent appointments to the en-,30
NA,"gineering and other staffs, applications",30
NA,should be publicly invited by advertisement,30
NA,in the Government Gazette and the public,30
NA,"press, and that those applications should",30
NA,be dealt with in the ordinary way. It is,30
NA,not yet clear whether or not permanent ap-,30
NA,pointments are to be made during the con-,30
NA,struction of this line.,30
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -No .,30
Mr FENTON , I think that some per-,31
NA,manent appointments will be absolutely,31
NA,necessary. Before the whole line is com-,31
NA,"pleted, certain portions of it no doubt",31
NA,"will be earning revenue, and we shall re-",31
NA,quire a staff of some kind to deal with the,31
NA,"traffic, and to control that revenue before",31
NA,the railway as a whole is constructed.,31
NA,"That being so, it will be absolutely neces-",31
NA,sary to appoint permanent officials before,31
NA,the whole line has been constructed.,31
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay-Prim e Min-,31
NA,ister and Treasurer) [2.27] -Th e amend-,31
NA,ment means that no appointment made by,31
NA,the Minister or the Government will enable,31
NA,the person so appointed to have the right,31
NA,to remain in the service for more than six,31
NA,months after the line has been opened for,31
NA,traffic. That will prevent Ministerial,31
NA,patronage in the case of appointments that,31
NA,will extend six months beyond the time,31
NA,taken for the construction of the railway.,31
NA,"As has been already stated, the Govern-",31
NA,"ment intend to bring in, later on, a ma-",31
NA,chinery Bill dealing with appointments to,31
NA,this service.,31
Mr GROOM ,An d that Bill will super-,31
NA,sede this provision.,31
Mr FISHER ,I t will to some extent.,31
NA,Appointments of a permanent character,31
NA,may then be made either by the Public,31
NA,Service Commissioner or some other autho-,31
NA,"rity, but no appointments made by the",31
NA,Minister or the Ministry will give the per-,31
NA,son appointed any position of permanency,31
NA,beyond six months after the construction,31
NA,of the line. That is the extreme limit; but,31
NA,from the first day or the first month other,31
NA,"machinery, to be brought into existence,",31
NA,will enable men who have shown their,31
NA,competency by passing prescribed exami-,31
NA,nations and so forth to become permanent,31
NA,officers of the Commonwealth railway ser-,31
NA,vice.,31
Mr CHARLTON ,Hunter) [2.29] - I,31
NA,am afraid that the amendment would pre-,31
NA,vent the adoption of the course just out-,31
NA,lined by the Prime Minister. I t may be,31
NA,found necessary to open sections of tlie,31
NA,before the whole railway is completed.,31
Mr GROOM ,Th e amendment refers to,31
NA,the time when the line is declared open for,31
NA,traffic.,31
Mr CHARLTON ,-Bu t a certain sec-,31
NA,tion may be declared open for traffic before,31
NA,the whole line is completed. An aurithat,31

NA,"sudden access of population, requiring the",31
NA,"partial opening of the line, and it might",31
NA,not suit the Government at that time to,31
NA,.dispense with particular employes.,31
Mr FISHER ,I n my opinion that would,31
NA,not be an opening of the line.,31
Mr CHARLTON ,Th e amendment,31
NA,would have that effect. I am personally,31
NA,favorable to what the Prime Minister,31
NA,"states, but he should see that the words",31
NA,used give effect to the real intention of,31
NA,the Government.,31
Mr FISHER ,"I t might be necessary, i f",31
NA,"there was any doubt, to specify that the",31
NA,opening of the line should be for traffic,31
NA,between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie.,31
Mr WEST ,East Sydney) [2.31] -Th e,31
NA,"Bill is merely a construction Bill, and had",31
NA,better be left as it is. The Government,31
NA,have stated that as soon as they are able,31
NA,they will bring in a Bill to deal with Com-,31
NA,monwealth railway management generally.,31
NA,Until then it would be better to give the,31
NA,Minister control without any of these limi-,31
NA,tations. ' The honorable member for Cook,31
NA,"wanted to put other matters into the Bill,",31
NA,but he should make those proposals when,31
NA,the subsequent measure is brought forward.,31
NA,The men who will be employed in the con-,31
NA,struction of the line will be very different,31
NA,from those who will be afterwards em-,31
NA,ployed in the management of traffic on the,31
NA,railway. After the opening those em-,31
NA,ployed will be servants of the Common-,31
NA,wealth just like the employes in the exist-,31
NA,ing Departments.,31
Mr JH CATTS ,Portion s of the line,31
NA,will be in complete working order before,31
NA,the whole line is finished.,31
Mr WEST , I understand that the,31
NA,construction will start at both ends. The,31
NA,best part of the material will have to be,31
NA,"taken from both ends, and as soon as the",31
NA,first 200 or 300 miles is completed the Go-,31
NA,vernment will run trains to carry the neces-,31
NA,"sary materials, and perhaps a few pas-",31
NA,sengers.,31
Mr GROOM , The Bill provides for,31
NA,that.,31
NA,MT. WEST -Tha t is why I do not,31
NA,think honorable members should try to,31
NA,line muddle the Bill up. The draftsman pre-,31
NA,pared it as a Bill for railway construction,31
NA,"only, and honorable members should leave",31
NA,all their ideals regarding railway manage-,31
NA,ment until the Railway Management Bill,31
NA,"is introduced later this session, or next ses-",31
NA,sion. Surely we have not come so low,31
NA,we cannot trust a Ministerial Depart-,31
NA,ment to engage the officers and men neces-,31
NA,sary for the construction of the line. My,31
NA,experience is that the men employed in the,31
NA,Commonwealth Departments are a credit,32
NA,"to tlie Government, and a credit to the",32
NA,country. I shall vote for the clause as,32
NA,"it stands, and feel almost disposed to",32
NA,divide the Committee on the amendment.,32
NA,Amendment agreed to.,32
NA,"Clause, as amended, agreed to.",32
NA,Clause 16 agreed to.,32
NA,Clause 17-,32
NA,"Notwithstanding anything in any Slate Act,",32
NA,the Minister need not cause any book of,32
NA,ence or plan to be made or deposited with any,32
NA,State authority in connexion with the railway.,32
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Richmond) [2.35] - I,32
NA,pointed out earlier that no plans of any,32
NA,sort had been submitted in connexion with,32
NA,the line. I find from the Queensland,32
NA,Hansard that in the Queensland Parlia-,32
NA,"ment, not only plans, but even the sections",32
NA,of the line and books of reference are,32
NA,drawn out and submitted. The whole,32
NA,question is then referred to a Select Com-,32
NA,"mittee, and until the report of the Com-",32
NA,mittee is finally adopted by the Parliament,32
NA,the line is not proceeded with.,32
NA,is not merely a construction Bill as argued,32
NA,by the honorable member for East Syd-,32
NA,ney. I t is a construction and working,32
NA,"Bill, and it even appropriates all the money",32
NA,that may be required for the construction,32
NA,of the line.,32
Mr FISHER , The Bill does not do,32
NA,that.,32
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Claus e 19 provides for,32
NA,it.,32
Mr FISHER ,Tha t clause does not vote,32
NA,any money.,32
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e clause distinctly,32
NA,"says, "" A l l money' necessary . . .",32
NA,shall be payable out of the Consolidated,32
NA,Revenue fund or out of . . .,32
NA,"Loan Fund, and the Consolidated Revenue",32
NA,Fund and the Loan Fund are hereby ap-,32
NA,"propriated for that purpose accordingly.""",32
Mr FISHER ,Th e money has to be pro-,32
NA,vided afterwards. I t will have to be,32
NA,specifically voted before it can be applied.,32
Mr MASSYGREENE ,Th e money may be,32
NA,applied without other authority than the,32
NA,Bill as it stands. We are asked to commit,32
NA,ourselves to the appropriation of the whole,32
NA,of the money necessary for the construction,32
NA,of the line without having submitted to us,32
NA,"any plans or specifications, or knowing how",32
NA,"the railway is to be built, except that it is",32
NA,to be on a 4-ft. %>\-\t\. gauge.,32
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs) [2.39] -,32
NA,What the honorable member for Richmond,32
NA,"has urged is rather important, and the",32
NA,Minister might make a statement as to,32
NA,whether it is the intention of the Govern-,32
NA,ment in constructing the line to follow fhe,32
NA,practice which has hitherto been observed,32
NA,in Queensland. I t is a sound practice re-,32
NA,"quiring plans, sections, and books of re-",32
NA,ference to be placed on the table of the,32
NA,"House, so that the whole scheme may be",32
NA,open for discussion. This clause seems to,32
NA,"contemplate the existence of such a practice,",32
NA,because it provides that it shall not be,32
NA,refer- necessary to deposit with any State,32
NA,authority books of reference or plans,32
NA,in connexion with the railway. That is,32
NA,"right, because it is our railway, and not a",32
NA,State railway. The Bill simply states that,32
NA,a rtilway line is to run according to the,32
NA,schedule. We know nothing about the,32
NA,details or plans.,32
Mr FISHER , I think they were laid on,32
NA,the table.,32
Mr GROOM , I do not think so. I,32
NA,"presume, according to what the Prime Mini-",32
NA,"ster recently said, that the necessary money",32
NA,This Bill will have to be appropriated on the Esti-,32
NA,mates by Parliament from time to time.,32
NA,"I f so, will the Minister promise to put the",32
NA,required information before the House be-,32
NA,fore any money is voted ?,32
Mr RILEY ,I t will be too late to do,32
NA,that when the Bill is through Committee.,32
Mr GROOM ,"I t is not too late, be-",32
NA,cause i f we retain the power to appropriate,32
NA,"money for the work, we retain control over",32
NA,it. I do not think it is fair to ask the,32
NA,Minister to make more than the promise I,32
NA,have indicated.,32
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin -,32
NA,Minister of Home Affairs) [2.41] -Wha t,32
NA,the honorable member states about the,32
NA,"the practice in some of the States is quite true,",32
NA,but those provisions are absolutely inap-,32
NA,plicable to the Commonwealth. We are,32
NA,starting a new institution altogether. Any,32
NA,information that is required we shall be,32
NA,only too willing to furnish.,32
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs) [2.42].,32
NA,-Wil l the Minister promise that before any,32
NA,appropriation is made by Parliament he,32
NA,"will supply, as far as possible, information",32
NA,"corresponding to the plans, sections, and",32
NA,books of reference which are laid on the,32
NA,"table of the Queensland Parliament, so",32
NA,that Parliament may appropriate the money,32
NA,with a knowledge oF what it is doing?,32
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin -,32
NA,Minister of Home Affairs) [2.43] -W e,32
NA,shall give the very fullest information.,32
Mr WH IRVINE ,Flinders) [2.44].,32
NA,- I do not think I quite understand the,32
NA,position. Has a promise been made that,33
NA,the money to be expended on the line,33
NA,be the subject of special appropriation,33
Mr FISHER ,Yes .,33
Mr WH IRVINE ,"I f that is so,",33
NA,"seems to cover the ground, because when",33
NA,Parliament is asked to make those special sary.,33
NA,appropriations the necessary information,33
NA,will be submitted to it. Clause 19 as it,33
NA,"stands, now makes the Bill an Appropriacase.",33
NA,tion Bill.,33
Mr FISHER ,Th e money will have to takes,33
NA,"be raised, but I have no objection",33
NA,the raising of the money the appropriation,33
NA,itself.,33
- Mr HALL ,Fro m time to time.,33
Mr WH IRVINE , I am glad to,33
NA,hear that. I t sweeps away most of the dif-,33
NA,"ficulties, although it will involve some the",33
NA,alteration in clause 19. I f the Prime the,33
NA,"Minister makes that promise, and the genethen",33
NA,ral character of an Appropriation Act is within,33
NA,taken away from the measure so that Parliament.,33
NA,"special appropriations will be required, it",33
NA,will be rather a mistake to tie our hands,33
NA,or the hands of the Government in this Bill,33
NA,as to the character of the information which meaning,33
NA,we shall require at the time.,33
NA,Clause agreed to.,33
NA,Clause 18 (Acquisition of lands).,33
Mr FENTON , I understand that under,33
NA,"the Lands Acquisition Act, land required",33
NA,for the line will be assessed at its value in,33
NA,the year 1908.,33

NA,"standing to the credit of the Loan Fund, and",33
NA,the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Loan,33

NA,(2.) No connexion which involves the construc-,34

Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [3.0] - I,34
NA,move-,34
NA,That the following new clause be inserted :-,34
NA,15A -(1. ) The working hours of officers ap-,34
NA,pointed for the purposes of the construction or,34
NA,the working of the railways shall not exceed,34
NA,"forty-eight per week, unless in cases of emer-",34
NA,"gency, when overtime may be worked.",34
NA,(2.) The minimum rate of wages for all adult,34
NA,officers appointed for the purposes of the con-,34
NA,struction or the working of the railway shall,34
NA,"not be less than eight shillings for eight hours,",34
NA,but nothing herein contained shall prevent the,34
NA,Minister from increasing such minimum rate.,34
NA,The Prime Minister has stated that the,34
NA,principle of this proposed new clause is,34
NA,"approved by the Government, and, there-",34
NA,"fore, it is not necessary for me to do more",34
NA,than move it.,34
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay-Prim e Min-,34
NA,ister and Treasurer) [3.1] -Ther e appears,34
NA,to me quite a number of unnecessary words,34
NA,at the conclusion of the proposed new,34
NA,clause; because to increase the rate or per-,34
NA,mit the working of overtime is a latent,34
NA,power that rests with the Minister. I ap-,34
NA,prove of the principle in the proposed,34
NA,"clause, but I do not think it advisable to",34
NA,"include the words "" but nothing herein",34
NA,contained shall prevent the Minister from,34
NA,"increasing such minimum rates.""",34
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [3.3] - I cannot,34
NA,"see the necessity for this clause, which is",34
NA,more like a political placard than any-,34
NA,thing else. I hope the rate of wages will,34
NA,always be retained at the level proposed.,34
Mr RILEY ,W e will not get workmen,34
NA,at 8s. for this line?,34
Mr GLYNN ,I f we insert a clause pro-,34
NA,viding for a rate of 8s. or 9s. we shall,34
NA,really embarrass the Minister. There might,34
NA,"be a strike at any time, and then what",34
NA,would be the good of talking of the Arbi-,34
NA,tration Act when the men were really strik-,34
NA,ing against the provisions of anotherAct,34
NA,of Parliament? I f we are to establish a,34
NA,"healthv principle in regard to wages, we",34
NA,[52],34
NA,"should make it applicable all round, and",34
NA,O'MALLEY) not confine it to a Bill of this kind.,34
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta),34
NA,[3-5-\--W e all agree that the best possible,34
NA,rates and conditions should obtain in con-,34
NA,nexion with work performed by or for the,34
NA,"rail- Commonwealth, and I wonder at the hon-",34
NA,orable member for Cook being so modest,34
NA,in his request.,34
Mr JH CATTS , I should like to move,34
NA,an increase.,34
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Workme n can,34
NA,get 8s. or 9s. a day in the more moderate,34
NA,"latitudes, and the minimum proposed now",34
NA,is too small. I therefore move-,34
NA,That the amendment be amended by leaving,34
NA,"out the word "" eight,"" first occurring, line 9,",34
NA,with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the word,34
NA,""" nine."" -",34
Mr CHARLTON ,Hunter) [3.6] -,34
NA,"Like the honorable member for Parramatta,",34
NA,I scarcely see the necessity for the pro-,34
NA,posed new clause. It has been accepted by,34
NA,"the Prime Minister, but I am very much",34
NA,afraid that i f it be passed the maximum of,34
NA,"forty-eight hours will become the minimum,",34
NA,"while we know that in some trades, which",34
NA,will be employed in the construction of the,34
NA,"line, the rule is forty-four hours per week.",34
NA,It is quite possible that the engineers in,34
NA,charge may take this clause as an instruc-,34
NA,tion to make the number of hours forty-,34
NA,"eight; and, therefore, I think it would be",34
NA,better to leave the matter to those respon-,34
NA,"sible for the work. As to the wages, i f I",34
NA,"were moving for a minimum, I should say",34
NA,that it should not be less than 10s. I have,34
NA,"had some experience of Western Australia,",34
NA,and I know that in the part of the coun-,34
NA,"try through which the line will run, men",34
NA,cannot be obtained for less than ns. per,34
NA,"day. Here, again, however, the officers in",34
NA,charge may take the new clause as a direc-,34
NA,tion to make the pay 8s. I f the matter be,34
NA,"left to the Minister and others in charge,",34
NA,we shall have better work and less trouble.,34
Mr RYRIE ,North Sydney) [3-8] -,34
NA,This new clause is an absolute revelation,34
NA,to me. I f it had been proposed by one of,34
NA,"the "" squatocracy "" I can imagine the howl",34
NA,there would have been from honorable mem-,34
NA,bers opposite. I t is proposed that the men,34
NA,engaged in this line should be paid 8s. per,34
NA,day.,34
Mr FRAZER ,That is the minimum;,34
NA,let us have no heroics !,34
Mr RYRIE ,Th e Prime Minister has,34
NA,practically given the approval of the Go-,34
NA,vernment to the proposed clause.,34
- Mr FISHER ,Wha t I say is that we,35
NA,should not pay less than 8s.,35
- Mr RYRIE ,W e know that very often,35
NA,the minimum becomes the maximum; and,35
NA,the clause will place the Minister of Home,35
NA,Affairs in a very peculiar position. At the,35
NA,Federal Capital a minimum of gs. a day is,35
NA,being paid.,35
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Permanen t hands,35
NA,are paid 8s.,35
Mr RYRIE ,Ther e will be permanent,35
NA,hands employed on the railway; at any,35
NA,"rate, I take i t that the unionists will be",35
NA,"pretty well permanent. At Canberra, where",35
NA,"there is, perhaps, the most salubrious",35
NA,"climate i n Australia, with all the con-",35
NA,veniences and luxuries of life-wattle s in,35
NA,"f u l l bloom, as shown on the advertising",35
NA,poster of the Commonwealth- a minimum,35
NA,"of QS. is paid, while i t is proposed to pay",35
NA,8s. in the arid districts of Western Aus-,35
NA,"tralia, where the heat of the summer is ap-",35
NA,"palling, and mosquitoes and sandflies make",35
NA,life absolutely unbearable. I f honorable,35
NA,members opposite have no consideration for,35
NA,"the working man, honorable members on",35
NA,this side have; and I shall support the pro-,35
NA,posal of the honorable member for Parra-,35
NA,matta.,35
Mr JH CATTS ,Cook) [3.12] -O n,35
NA,previous occasions we have experienced the,35
NA,tactics which our friends opposite are now,35
NA,employing. We know how much concerned,35
NA,the honorable member for Parramatta and,35
NA,the honorable member for North Sydney,35
NA,are i n the matter o f wages.,35
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I was always,35
NA,favour of higher wages than was the honor-,35
NA,able member.,35
Mr JH CATTS ,Tha t did not ap-,35
NA,pear to be so when the honorable member,35
NA,was Postmaster-General of New South,35
NA,"Wales, f or then the Post Office was one of",35
NA,the sweating dens of Australia.,35
The CHAIRMAN , The honorable,35
NA,member is not in order i n discussing the,35
NA,Post Office-,35
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I s the present Post-,35
NA,master-General fixing the wages in the,35
NA,Post Office?,35
Mr JH CATTS ,Th e present Postday.,35
NA,master-General does much better than the,35
NA,honorable member ever did. The new there,35
NA,"clause proposes not a"" maximum, But an",35
NA,solute minimum. As to the words,35
NA,"which the Prime Minister takes exception,",35
NA,I may say that in some of the awards,35
NA,in New South Wales i n which I was conmaximum working day.,35
NA,"cerned, a minimum rate o f 7s. was re-",35
NA,garded by. railway officers in charge as,35
NA,"rate to be paid, and in subsequent awards",35
NA,words similar to those I have used were in-,35
NA,"serted, setting forth distinctly that the",35
NA,minimum rate did not prevent an increase,35
NA,being paid. I n South Australia to-day the,35
NA,rate for similar work is 8s.,35
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,A t Port Augusta?,35
Mr JH CATTS ,"Yes , anywhere in",35
NA,South Australia. I n Western Australia,35
NA,8s. per day is the minimum rate o f,35
NA,pay. I f these nien are working at,35
NA,points f a r removed from centres of,35
NA,population i n South Australia or West-,35
NA,"ern Australia, i t may be necessary for the",35
NA,Government to make them a number of al-,35
NA,lowances ; i t may be necessary to carry all,35
NA,"their provisions and supplies, and the Min-",35
NA,"ister, i f he thought i t justifiable, would cer-",35
NA,tainly increase the rate o f pay. I have,35
NA,no fear that the rate will be unduly in-,35
NA,"creased, because I think that the men who",35
NA,"do the work o f the world, no matter how",35
NA,"much they receive,- never get more than that",35
NA,to which they are entitled. Under present,35
NA,"conditions, the fight against those who do",35
NA,the work of the world is so keen that they,35
NA,are not likely to get the product of their,35
NA,labour. I should be very pleased i f a,35
NA,higher rate than that named i n the clause,35
NA,could be prescribed. The Minister of,35
NA,Home Affairs is at present paying in re-,35
NA,spect o f the same class of work in the,35
NA,"Federal Territory 8s. per day, whilst those",35
NA,vvho have broken time receive 9s. per day.,35
Mr CANN , I t is not enough.,35
Mr JH CATTS ,W e all think that.,35
NA,i n No doubt we should all like to see these,35
NA,men receiving higher wages; but i t is only,35
NA,since the Labour party became a force,35
NA,in politics that the working men have had,35
NA,a chance o f getting anything like 8s. per,35
NA,day. I know that they have been employed,35
NA,in New South Wales at 6s. 6d. and 7s.,35
NA,a day.,35
Mr FENTON ,The y are getting that in,35

NA,"to vice, receiving only 6s. a day. I t must",35
NA,be distinctly understood that the proposal,35
NA,is one for a minimum rate of pay and a,35
NA,The right honorable member for Swan,35
NA,the asked whether we ought not tofixthe rates,35
NA,of pay of the professional men in the ser-,36
NA,"vice ; but,. as a matter of fact, they do",36
NA,not work more than thirty-seven hours per,36
NA,"week. I f , in their case, a shorter",36
NA,"working day is desirable, no doubt the",36
NA,Minister will take action. I should like,36
NA,to see a universal maximum working week,36
NA,of forty-four hours. The great difficulty,36
NA,in connexion with the Railway Departments,36
NA,of Australia is that a practice has grown,36
NA,"up of working the men nine, ten, and",36
NA,"twelve hours a day, and that when the",36
NA,"workers ask for a forty-eight hours week,",36
NA,the responsible officers at once present an,36
NA,estimate showing that the granting of such,36
NA,a request would mean a loss of hundreds of,36
NA,"thousands of pounds, and would really be",36
NA,impracticable.,36
NA,My desire is to prevent such a state,36
NA,of affairs growing up in the Com-,36
NA,"monwealth railway service, so that we",36
NA,shall not have to do a few years hence,36
NA,what we have to do to-day in connexion,36
NA,with the railway services of the States.,36
NA,VVe have had to collect thousands ot pounds,36
NA,from the workers in the State Departments;,36
NA,we have had to fight for months and months,36
NA,before Arbitration Courts and Wages,36
NA,"Boards, and have then found that pre-",36
NA,cedents that have grown up have a more,36
NA,powerful influence on the chairman or pre-,36
NA,siding Judge than has the equity of a claim,36
NA,for a working week of forty-eight hours.,36
NA,The laying down of these principles in the,36
NA,Bill will do good throughout Australia.,36
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay-Prim e Min-,36
NA,ister and Treasurer) [3.20] -W e have,36
NA,reached an interesting situation in this mat-,36
NA,"ter, since, apparently, the question as be-",36
NA,tween the Government side and the Opposi-,36
NA,tion side of the House is as to who is to,36
NA,make the larger bid.,36
Mr KELLY ,Tha t is the frankest con-,36
NA,fession I have heard. .,36
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wha t a confession,36
NA,to make on the floor of the House.,36
Mr FISHER ,Th e assumed innocence,36
NA,of the honorable member for Parramatta,36
NA,and the honorable member for Wentworth,36
NA,in these matters is certainly remarkable.,36
NA,The Government position is that they will,36
NA,not ask any adult to work on the construc-,36
NA,tion of this railway for less than 8s.,36
NA,per day for a working week of forty-eight,36
NA,"hours. Whilst we accept that principle, we",36
NA,"go a great deal further, and say that union",36
NA,rates of wages shall be paid on this work.,36
NA,I have Heard it said by honorable members,36
NA,opposite that i f 8s. per day were made the,36
NA,"minimum, it would prove to be the maxi-",36
NA,[52]- 2,36
NA,mum. The weight of testimony is cer-,36
NA,tainly in favour of inserting neither the one,36
NA,provision nor the other in the Bill itself.,36
NA,"I shall go further,, and say publicly, as 1",36
NA,"have already stated, that the policy of the",36
NA,Government is that they will give every,36
NA,facility to any aggrieved body to go to the,36
NA,"Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court,",36
NA,and that they will pay the highest award,36
NA,fixed by the Commonwealth Conciliation,36
NA,"and Arbitration Court, any State Wages",36
NA,"Board, or State Conciliation Court. That",36
NA,should be a sufficient guarantee to honor-,36
NA,able members generally that justice will be,36
NA,done; and I . think the Committee might:,36
NA,well allow the Bill to pass.,36
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [3.23] - I am,36
NA,gratified to think that the Prime Minister,36
NA,has been induced by the arguments of the,36
NA,Opposition to recede from the position into,36
NA,which he was led by the honorable mem-,36
NA,ber for Cook. The arguments advanced by,36
NA,the honorable member for Cook have a very,36
NA,unstable foundation. He says that his,36
NA,reason for asking that a minimum wage of,36
NA,"8s. shall be fixed is that, otherwise, the",36
NA,"Department may sweat these men, and pay",36
NA,them still lower wages. He states that he,36
NA,desires a higher wage than 8s. a day; but,36
NA,asks that that rate shall be fixed as a mini-,36
NA,"mum, because, otherwise, the Government",36
NA,will sweat these men.,36
Mr JH CATTS , I said other Govern-,36
NA,ments might do so.,36
Mr KELLY ,No ; the honorable mem-,36
NA,ber said that it was the practice of Go-,36
NA,vernment Departments to sweat the men.,36
NA,"If that is so, it is obvious that 8s. per day",36
NA,is much too low a minimum to fix for work,36
NA,such as this. There is no question in the,36
NA,"minds of honorable members, with the ex-",36
NA,"ception, perhaps, of the honorable member",36
NA,"for Cook, who sprang up to make a bid",36
NA,"for popularity, and found himself in a",36
NA,quagmire,36
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -H e is a real,36
NA,Christian.,36
Mr KELLY , I am not saying more of,36
NA,him than the Prime Minister himself said in,36
NA,this regard. The right honorable gentle-,36
NA,"man said that, apparently, both sides were",36
NA,making a bid. I have adopted hisphrase;,36
NA,but if the honorable member thinks it in-,36
NA,"sulting, I shall at once withdraw it. I f",36
NA,"we are to specify any wage in this Bill, we",36
NA,shall need at least to fix the rate of wages,36
NA,which the Minister of Home Affairs him-,36
NA,self has declared shall be paid in Mel-,36
NA,bourne. The conditions in the case of work,36
NA,"on this railway being harder, the wages",37
NA,should be a little higher.,37
Mr CHARLTON ,The y must be higher.,37
Mr KELLY ,The y must be higher;,37
NA,otherwise we shall not be able to obtain,37
NA,requisite labour. So far as public De-,37
NA,"partments are concerned, the minimum wage",37
NA,almost invariably becomes the maximum.,37
NA,That has been our experience in all branches,37
NA,of the Postmaster-General's Department;,37
NA,and I am gratified that the Prime Minister,37
NA,has seen the error of his ways in accepting,37
NA,"the amendment, and that ample provision is",37
NA,now to be made for paying a decent wage,37
NA,to the men who will be engaged on this,37
NA,arduous work.,37
Mr CANN ,Nepean) [3.26] - I am,37
NA,pleased that the Prime Minister intends to,37
NA,allow the Bill to remain as it stands. I,37
NA,"represent a constituency comprising 2,000",37
NA,railway workers. They have a strong,37
NA,"union, and in different parts of New South",37
NA,Wales different rates of wages are paid.,37
NA,There are two classes of labour engaged in,37
NA,railway construction. At present the mini-,37
NA,mum for pick and shovel men in New South,37
NA,Wales is fixed at 8s. per day. They are,37
NA,"asking, however, that the rate shall be",37
NA,creasedto 9s. per day. Those who are,37
NA,working in tunnels receive a minimum wage,37
NA,of about 9s. or 9s. 6d. a day; but there,37
NA,are also jumper-men and men engaged in,37
NA,"other branches of work, for whom ios. per",37
NA,"day might not be sufficient, having regard",37
NA,to the country through which this railway,37
NA,"will pass. We might, indeed, have to pay",37
NA,"12s. per day, or more. I think that the",37
NA,Prime Minister has taken the right step in,37
NA,"declaring that trade-union rates of wages,",37
NA,"whatever they may be, shall be paid.",37
Mr HEDGES ,Fremantle) [3.27] - I,37
NA,agree with the remarks made by the honor-,37
NA,able member who has just resumed his seat.,37
NA,It would be impossible to secure men to,37
NA,build this line at the rate of wages men-,37
NA,tioned in the proposed new clause. I am,37
NA,able to speak with authority on this ques-,37
NA,"tion, because I have had to pay wages. A",37
NA,man who enters into a contract to construct,37
NA,a railway is foolish i f he does not secure,37
NA,"the very best labour, and pay the best",37
NA,wages.,37
Mr JH CATTS ,Bu t the honorable,37
NA,member must remember,37
Mr HEDGES , I remember more than,37
NA,the honorable member ever knew. A man,37
NA,who talks of men working eight hours a,37
NA,day at plate-laying in the interior of,37
NA,tralia knows nothing of the subject. I t is,37
NA,usual to send out a certain quantity of,37
NA,material to the head of the road. There,37
NA,"a gang is organized, and i f the men put in",37
NA,"that material within six hours, they knock",37
NA,"off, and get paid loi the full day. They",37
NA,the certainly prefer working under such con-,37
NA,ditions. There was never a more willing,37
NA,class of workers than are those engaged on,37
NA,railway construction works. The working,37
NA,"men of Western Australia will, to a man,",37
NA,be anxious to contribute to a fund to build,37
NA,a monument to the memory of the member,37
NA,of the Labour party who has suggested,37
NA,this magnificent wage of 8s. per day for,37
NA,railway construction workers in that State.,37
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang),37
NA,[3.29] - I am in thorough agreement with,37
NA,those who say that a minimum wage of 8s.,37
NA,a day is an absolutely ridiculous payment,37
NA,to fix for the men who will be engaged in,37
NA,"the construction of this railway, and wili",37
NA,be far removed from centres of civilization.,37
NA,Special inducements will have to be offered.,37
NA,The highest rates of wages prescribed for,37
NA,Perth or Fremantle would be wholly in-,37
NA,adequate for work performed in the wilds,37
NA,of Western Australia.,37
Mr FISHER ,Thi s will be an Inter-State,37
NA,"in- case, because the railway will be in two",37
NA,"States. The question of wages, therefore,",37
NA,can be brought before the Commonwealth,37
NA,Arbitration Court.,37
NA,Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON -I n any,37
NA,"case, we in this Parliament ought to fix",37
NA,some sort of a minimum below which men,37
NA,will not be expected to work on the line.,37
NA,No man shoula be expected to perform,37
NA,the most unskilled form of labour in,37
NA,country like that at less than ios. a day,37
NA,at the least. I doubt whether many men,37
NA,will be obtained to go out to perform that,37
NA,work at anything like that wage. I t would,37
NA,be very wrong for us to think of proposing,37
NA,any smaller sum than ios. a day i f we,37
NA,are going to do anything in the way of,37
NA,fixing a minimum wage.,37
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [3.32] -,37
NA,The honorable member for Cook and the,37
NA,honorable member for Parramatta would,37
NA,be well advised to withdraw their amend-,37
NA,ments after the assurance given to the,37
NA,Committee by the Prime Minister. The,37
NA,honorable member for Cook has had a good,37
NA,"deal to do with railway employes, and",37
NA,any one who has had that experience re-,37
NA,"alizes that, generally speaking, the State",37
NA,Railway Departments are the biggest,37
NA,sweating dens that we have in the com-,37
NA,Aus- munity. No doubt the honorable member,37
NA,wanted to lever the State Railway De-,37
NA,partments up a little.,37
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta),38
NA,'[3.33] - I shall be only too willing to,38
NA,leave the whole matter in the hands of the,38
NA,-Government. The conditions in that,38
NA,"-country are novel, and will require a great",38
NA,deal of re-adjustment from time to time.,38
NA,"The Government, therefore, require the",38
NA,"freest hand to deal with all the conditions,",38
NA,"labour and otherwise, in the construction",38
NA,-of a railway of that kind. I f we are to,38
NA,"fix a minimum wage, 8s. is a ridiculous",38
NA,amount to offer to a man in that country.,38
NA,"On the whole, it would be better i f the",38
NA,(proposal were withdrawn and the matter,38
NA,left in the hands of the constructional,38
NA,"authorities, who in this case will be the",38
NA,Government.,38
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Swan) [3.34].,38
NA,--W e had better leave the matter to the,38
NA,Government. The object of the honorable,38
NA,"member for Cook is, of course, to secure",38
NA,a good wage for those employed in the con-,38
NA,"struction of the line, but he need have no",38
NA,anxiety on that score under the existing,38
NA,conditions of Australia. I t might be,38
NA,"argued that a minimum wage, if fixed,",38
NA,"would become the maximum, and I do not",38
NA,thing any one could find fault with a Go-,38
NA,"vernment for saying, "" We will not give",38
NA,"more than 8s. a day,"" i f the law said that",38
NA,they would be within the mark in paying,38
NA,8s. a day. These things will have to be,38
NA,"left to the Government, and although I am",38
NA,"in favour of a good wage, it is not desir-",38
NA,able to put the amount in the Bill. The,38
NA,Government would be in a better position i f,38
NA,they had a free hand.,38
Mr ATKINSON ,Wilmot) [3.36] - I,38
NA,am rather surprised that the Prime Minis-,38
NA,ter should have accepted the amendment.,38
Mr FISHER , 1 said I had no objection,38
NA,"to putting in a minimum of that kind,",38
NA,because we intended to pay more.,38
Mr ATKINSON , I t seems quite un-,38
NA,"necessary, because the Government have",38
NA,"already announced that, on all Government",38
NA,"work where casual labour obtains, they",38
NA,intend to pay union rates and work union,38
NA,"hours. There is no need, therefore, to",38
NA,fix a minimum wage in this Bill. The,38
NA,best rates prevailing at the time will be,38
NA,paid as a matter of course. I f we are,38
NA,going to fix a minimum it will be most,38
NA,"unfair to bring it down to 8s., seeing how",38
NA,labour is paid at present in the Common-,38
NA,wealth. The minimum should be ios. a,38
NA,"day at least at a time like this, and i f the",38
NA,present prosperity continues it may become,38
NA,more.,38
Mr FAIRBAIRN ,W e are getting a good,38
NA,railway.,38
Mr ATKINSON , I am not objecting,38
NA,to good wages. I want to see the work-,38
NA,men get the best wages that can be paid.,38
NA,The honorable member for Cook is doing,38
NA,"himself an injustice. Some one may,",38
NA,"perhaps not rightly, suggest that be is",38
NA,"making this proposal merely as a placard,",38
NA,"so that he may point it out to his electors,",38
NA,"saying, "" I looked after the interests of the",38
NA,workers. I saw that a minimum of 8s.,38
NA,"was put i n . "" I n the circumstances, the",38
NA,honorable member might very well with-,38
NA,"draw the amendment, because all that he",38
NA,is seeking is sure to be thoroughly safe-,38
NA,guarded in view of what has taken place,38
NA,in this House and of what this Govern-,38
NA,ment-an d I suppose every other Govern-,38
NA,ment that succeeds it-wil l do in the,38
NA,matter. Wherever Federal work of this,38
NA,"sort is to be carried on, it may be safely",38
NA,laid down that whatever Government is in,38
NA,office the proper rate of wage for that,38
NA,work will be paid.,38
Mr MATHEWS ,Melbourne Ports),38
NA,[3-3 ]-- I,38
NA,8 a m,38
NA,afraid that the honorable,38
NA,inember for Wilmot made a mistake in,38
NA,saying that whatever Government is in,38
NA,power this minimum will be paid. He,38
NA,knows as well as I do that the Tasmanian,38
NA,Government would pay only 6s. a day.,38
Mr ATKINSON ,Ho w could the Tas-,38
NA,manian Government be in power in this,38
NA,Parliament ?,38
Mr MATHEWS , I am trying to show,38
NA,that the wage might be brought down to,38
NA,6s. if some people had their way. I am,38
NA,only sorry that the honorable member for,38
NA,Cook did not fix ios. instead of 8s.,38
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [3-39.1-- I,38
NA,hope the Committee is not going to allow,38
NA,what we have just listened to to be placed,38
NA,on the pages of Hansard. This Chamber,38
NA,ought to have some legislative conscience.,38
NA,We ought not to endeavour to use Han-,38

NA,"sonally, with regard to the payment of",38
NA,wages and the. treatment of their em-,38
NA,"ployes, we might raise a storm in this",38
NA,"Chamber, and seriously injure the feelings",38
NA,of some of those whom wc denounced; but,38
NA,I do not think that we should be really,38
NA,helping business. We can show better,38
NA,feeling by trying to make the parties in,38
NA,this Chamber responsible for party action,38
NA,in this Chamber only. . The wages and,39
NA,conditions in the various States are matters,39

Mr FENTON , I am glad to say that in,39
NA,some State Departments the salaries have,39

NA,I had intended to move an amendment. to-,39
NA,"this effect on clause 4, but was unavoidably",39
NA,absent from the Chamber when that clause',39
NA,was passed. The route which I think,39
NA,should be followed has a number of ad-,39
NA,vantages. The character of the coun-,39
NA,"try to be passed through is known, its",39
NA,"water supply is known, and its adoption",39
NA,would enable construction -to be carried on-,39
NA,"simultaneously from six points, namely, at.",39
NA,"Kalgoorlie eastwards, at Port Augusta",39
NA,"westwards, and at Fowler's Bay and at",39
NA,Eucla in both directions. The southern-,39
NA,route which I advocate is shorter than that,39
NA,"provided for in the schedule, and, accord-,",39
NA,"ing to the estimate of a competent engineer,,",39
NA,"would cost about ^700,000 less. The",39
NA,"engineer to whom I refer is Mr Gwynneth,",39
NA,one of the most competent railway engi-,39
NA,neers in Australia. An estimate of the-,39
NA,probable cost of the work was made in-,39
NA,"March, 1903, by a conference of engineers,",39
NA,and Mr Gwynneth made another estimate-,39
NA,on his own account. In July of the same-,39
NA,year the conference of engineers reduced',39
NA,its estimate to within a few pounds of his..,39
NA,"Then, again, the conference of engineers-",39
NA,estimated the cost of surveying the route at,39
NA,".£50,000, whereas Mr Gwynneth's esti-",39
NA,"mate was ^20,000, and the work was done",39
NA,for that sum. I have a number of figures,39
NA,statements which support the proposal-,39
NA,"which have made to the Committee, but",39
NA,I do not propose to use them..,39
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin -,39
NA,Minister of Home Affairs) [3-S4]- - I,39
NA,would point out that the route proposed,39
NA,to be followed by the honorable member,39
NA,"for Herbert runs near the coast, so that",39
NA,it would be easy for an enemy to land and,39
NA,destroy-the line. Mr Deane has gone into,39
NA,"this matter of route very carefully, and the",39
NA,whole subject has been before us for four or,39
NA,"five months, but, leaving aside all ques-",39
NA,"tions of cost, facilities for construction, and",39
NA,"the like, it is sufficient to say now that we",39
NA,desire to have the road far enough away,39
NA,from the coast to prevent its destruction,39
NA,by an enemy and to provide for settlement.,39
Mr FOWLER ,Coul d there not be,39
NA,branches run out from the main line?,39
NA,Mr KING O'MALLEY -Tha t is a,39

Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [3.56] -1»,39

NA,suggest that he should take counsel with the,40
NA,Minister of Defence as to whether it would,40
NA,not be wiser to take the line a little fur-,40

NA,"the High Court ruled that Parliament, in",40
NA,"providing for trade within a State, had gone",40
NA,further than it was constitutionally entitled,40
NA,"to do, and the whole measure was declared",40
NA,null and void. The Bill I am now intro-,40
NA,ducing is exactly similar to the measure,40
NA,"passed by the last Parliament, with the",40
NA,exception that the provision objected to by,40
NA,"the High Court is omitted. I find, on",40
NA,"looking up the records, that the Bill in last",40
NA,Parliament was passed through all its,40
NA,"stages in an hour and a half; and, as I",40
NA,believe the House is practically unanimous,40
NA,"in the desire to protect the seamen, I shall",40
NA,take up no further time on the present,40
NA,occasion.,40
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta),40
NA,[4.2] - I see no objection to the Bill going,40
NA,"through, since it merely corrects one of",40
NA,the details in the similar measure introduced,40
NA,"by the Government, of which I had the",40
NA,honour to be a member. I should like to,40
NA,"say, however, that this Bill is an answer to",40
NA,the statements which were made throughout,40
NA,Australia on the occasion of the referenda,40
NA,that this Government would have no power,40
NA,to give compensation to seamen unless the,40
NA,referenda were approved. We have very,40
NA,substantial power whicb is embodied in the,40
NA,Bill before us.,40
Mr TUDOR ,Bu t we have yet to learn,40
NA,what the High Court may say.,40
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I f I thought,40
NA,"this were an experimental measure, I should",40
NA,"10th October, i g t i . oppose it, because we ought to have no more",40
NA,experiments in a matter of this kind. I,40
NA,should have thought the Minister would,40
NA,take steps to satisfy himself that the Bill,40
NA,was within the compass and scope of the,40
NA,Constitution.,40
Mr TUDOR ,Th e late Government be-,40
NA,lieved they were within the Constitution.,40
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Bu t the present,40
NA,"Government have an advantage, inasmuch",40
NA,as every clause of this Bill has been re-,40
NA,"viewed by the Judges of the High Court,",40
NA,whereas we were breaking new ground.,40
NA,"Your obedient servant,",40
NA,"J. G. DAVIES, Speaker. My only object is to place this Bill 011 the",40
NA,statute-book in the hope that its beneficent,40
NA,BILL. provisions may speedily apply to those un-,40
NA,fortunate enough to meet with injuries,40
NA,"when they "" go down to the sea in ships.""",40
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [4.5] -Ha s,40
NA,"the Minister, in view of the doubts to",40
NA,vvhich he has given perfunctory expression,40
NA,"as to the legality of the measure, taken",40
NA,steps to submit it in draft form to the,40
NA,"High Court, or a Justice of the High",40
NA,"Court, in the terms of the provision passed",40
NA,last session.,40
Mr TUDOR ,Tha t cannot be done until,40
NA,this Bill is passed.,40
Mr KELLY ,"Then , as soon as it is",40
NA,"passed, the Minister will have an oppor-",40
NA,tunity to test it in the High Court.,40
Mr GROOM ,Darling Downs) [4.8] -,40
NA,The Minister is acting wisely in submitting,40
NA,"this Bill, although we have been called",41
NA,upon so suddenly to deal with it as to,41
NA,place us at a disadvantage in considering,41
NA,"it without notice. I t would appear, so far",41
NA,as one can form an opinion on the spur of,41
NA,"the moment, that the Minister has correctly",41
NA,stated the effect of the recent decision of,41
NA,the High Court. That decision has,41
NA,been to render the principal Act,41
NA,invalid; but I think that this mea-,41
NA,sure is so drafted as to bring it within,41
NA,the general powers conferred by the,41
NA,Constitution. Section 51 of the Constitu-,41
NA,tion provides that the Parliament shall have,41
NA,power to make laws with respect to trade,41
NA,"and commerce with other countries, and",41
NA,"among the States, while section 98 declares",41
NA,that the power of the Parliament to make,41
NA,laws with respect to trade and commerce,41
NA,extends to navigation and shipping. We,41
NA,"are, therefore, empowered to make laws",41
NA,with respect to navigation and shipping with,41
NA,"other countries and among the States, and",41
NA,the Bill is so drafted as practically to,41
NA,clare inter alia that the principal Act,41
NA,apply to ships engaged in trade and com-,41
NA,merce with other countries and among the,41
NA,"States. Speaking off-hand, it would ap-",41
NA,pear that the Bill is framed in,41
NA,such a way as to confine our juris-,41
NA,diction within the absolute terms of,41
NA,the Constitution. The Commonwealth has,41
NA,jurisdiction over trade and commerce with,41
NA,"other countries and among the States,",41
NA,whilst the States themselves have jurisdic-,41
NA,tion over trade and commerce within the,41
NA,States. The Commonwealth Parliament,41
NA,"may, therefore, pass a measure providing",41
NA,for adequate compensation to seamen who,41
NA,are engaged in the shipping trade between,41
NA,"State and State, or between Australia and",41
NA,"other countries, and the State Legisla-",41
NA,tures may also legislate on exactly the,41
NA,same terms in regard to granting compen-,41
NA,"sation within a State, so that the whole",41
NA,area may thus be covered.,41
Mr FISHER ,The y can cover one por-,41
NA,"tion, whilst we covpr the other.",41
Mr GROOM ,Tha t is so. I do not,41
NA,think that this judgment can be said to,41
NA,give us a complete definition of our powers,41
NA,with respect to navigation.,41
Mr TUDOR ,Th e Court did not deal,41
NA,with that point.,41
Mr GROOM ,No ; but it is a matter,41
NA,that must engage our attention when the,41
NA,Navigation Bill is before us. From the,41
NA,"American authorities, it would appear that",41
NA,Congress has power to legislate in re-,41
NA,spect of shipping leaving a port of a,41
NA,"State, going out upon the high seas and of",41
NA,"the territorial jurisdiction of the country,",41
NA,and returning again to another port of,41
NA,that State. We do not yet know what our,41
NA,powers are in this respect. I t seems clear,41
NA,that the navigation power of the United,41
NA,States of America is a good deal wider,41
NA,than most people contemplate. The desire,41
NA,of all parts of the House is that we shall,41
NA,do all that is possible to secure compensa-,41
NA,"tion for seamen, and this Bill will be a",41
NA,useful contribution to legislation in that,41
NA,direction.,41

Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta),41
NA,de- [4.13] - I wish to ask the Postmaster-,41
NA,"shall General whether he has made inquiries,",41
NA,"with a view to ascertaining i f there is, in",41
NA,"his Department, the original contract be-",41
NA,tween the owners of private telephone lines,41
NA,and the Government? He promised to,41
NA,"make inquiries, and have the contract laid",41
NA,on the table of the House.,41
Mr THOMAS ,Barrier-Postmaster -,41
NA,General) [4.14] - I promise the honorable,41
NA,member that I shall have the contract laid,41
NA,on the table before the House is asked to,41
NA,deal with the measure relating to the,41

NA,BILL.,41
Mr THOMAS ,Barrier-Postmaster -,41
NA,General) [4-15] - I move-,41
NA,That this Bill be now read a second time.,41
NA,When the Bill establishing penny postage,41
NA,"was in Committee in this House, I agreed",41
NA,to an amendment to the effect that books,41
NA,that were printed in Australia should go,41
NA,through at the very cheap rate of 8 oz.,41
NA,"for i d . Since that Bill became law, quite",41
NA,a number of business people are claiming,41
NA,"that their catalogues, trade papers, and",41
NA,price-lists are books. There was no inten-,41
NA,tion on my part to allow price-lists or cata-,41
NA,logues to go through as books. There,41
NA,seems to be a little difficulty in defining,41
NA,exactly what a book is. In order to make,41
NA,sure that catalogues and price-lists shall,41
NA,not be allowed to go through the post as,41
NA,"books, this Bill has been introduced.",41
Mr GROOM ,Wha t is the objection to,42
NA,treating them as books?,42
Mr THOMAS ,On e objection is that,42
NA,it will mean a tremendous amount of stuff,42
NA,going through the post at a very cheap rate.,42
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Di d the Penny,42
NA,"Postage Bill, as amended with the Minis-",42
NA,"ter's consent, alter the existing practice?",42
NA,"Prior to that time, could catalogues, &c,",42
NA,be sent through the post as books?,42
Mr THOMAS , No; they went,42
NA,through as commercial papers and printed,42
NA,"matter, at the rate of 4 oz. for i d . The",42
NA,Penny Postage Bill fixed the rate for that,42
NA,"sort of matter at 2 oz. for Jd., which",42
NA,was rather an advantage. . A price-list,42
NA,weighing 2 oz. would previously have,42
NA,"cost i d . , while one weighing 6 oz. would",42
NA,have cost 2d. That Bill made the postage,42
NA,"on 2 oz. Jd., and on 6 oz. i$d. It has,",42
NA,"therefore, made it easier and cheaper to",42
NA,"send catalogues, price-lists and other printed",42
NA,matter through the post. We provided in,42
NA,"the Penny Postage Bill, as introduced, that",42
NA,newspapers and magazines printed in Aus-,42
NA,tralia should go through the post at a,42
NA,cheaper rate than newspapers and maga-,42
NA,zines printed outside; and I agreed to,42
NA,an amendment according the same privilege,42
NA,in the case of books. We are prepared to,42
NA,continue that privilege for books in the,42
NA,"ordinary sense, but we do not believe that",42
NA,catalogues and printed lists should be,42
NA,treated as books. As the Supply Bill has,42
NA,"now been returned from another place, T",42

NA,LABOUR PARTY'S LOYALTY.,12
Mr KNOX , I wish to know from the,12
NA,Prime Minister i f his attention has been,12
NA,drawn to a cablegram which appears in this,12
NA,"morning's Argus, stating that Mr H . P.",12
NA,"Wyatt, who recently visited Australia as an",12
NA,"envoy of the Imperial Navy League, has",12
NA,declared that he has no hesitation in saying,12
NA,that the Labour leaders in Australia are dis-,12
NA,"loyal, and are separatists.",12
NA,NA,12
Mr KNOX , I f the attention of the,12
NA,Prime Minister has been drawn to the report,12
NA,"in question, I ask him whether he believes",12
NA,"the feelings of the members of his Ministry,",12
NA,or of the Labour Party in the Federal,12
NA,"Parliament, to have been correctly repre-",12
NA,sented by Mr Wyatt - I f he believes that,12
NA,"they have not been correctly represented,",12
NA,will he make a positive disclaimer on behalf,12
NA,of the Government of the Commonwealth of,12
NA,the opinions attributed to the Labour leaders,12
NA,here?,12
NA,NA,12
NA,think that the statement is true ?,12
Mr KNOX , I know that it is not true.,12
Mr WATSON ,M y attention has been,12
NA,diawn to the cablegram in question. The,12
NA,statement therein attributed to Mr Wyatt,12
NA,is absolutely ridiculous and untrue. I t is,12
NA,certainly untrue so far as the members of,12
NA,"this Ministry are concerned, and it does not",12
NA,in the slightest degree represent the feeling,12
NA,"of the Labour leaders of Australia, so far as",12
NA,I have been able to. ascertain it. I t is cer-,12
NA,tainly the fact that the Labour leaders of,12
NA,the various States refused to have anything,12
NA,to do with a faddist of Mr Wyatt's de-,12
NA,scription.,12
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Doe s the honorable,12
NA,member think that Mr Wvatt is a faddist ?,12
Mr WATSON ,"Yes , and I think that",12
NA,"in England, also, he is .looked upon as a",12
NA,faddist.,12
Sir JOHN FORREST ,H e did not appear,12
NA,to me in that light.,12
Mr WATSON , I am expressing my,12
NA,own opinion only. I know that the right,12
NA,honorable member has somewhat exag-,12
NA,gerated ideas on Imperial subjects. So far,12
NA,as the people in the Labour movement,12
NA,"throughout Australia are concerned, although",12
NA,they are not of the hysterical brand,13
NA,"of loyalists, I do not think there is the",13
NA,slightest evidence of - their ever having,13
NA,shown any desire for' separation from the,13
NA,Empire. The statement that that is de-,13
NA,sired by. those connected with the political,13
NA,Labour movement of Australia is absolutely,13
NA,incorrect. I may add that I do not know,13
NA,what steps Mr Wyatttook to ascertain the,13
NA,feelings of the Labour leaders of Australia,13
NA,in this matter.,13
NA,ADJOURNMENT (Formal).,13
NA,LYNDHURST WATER SUPPLY.,13
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Macquarie) - I,13
NA,regret that I feel compelled to move the,13
NA,journment of the House this.morning.,13
Mr CARPENTER ,Wate r again?,13
Mr SPEAKER ,"Ma v I take this, op-",13
NA,portunity to remind the House that honor-,13
NA,able members when speaking are to be taken,13
NA,"as expressing their own opinions, though",13
NA,"not necessarily those of their fellow mem-,",13
NA,bers; and that every honorable member is,13
NA,entitled to place his own views before the,13
NA,"assembly, even though they mav be views",13
NA,"from, which every other honorable member",13
NA,dissents. I ask honorable members to listen,13
NA,"to the member addressing the Chair,",13
NA,without striving by interjection to force,13
NA,to express their views instead of his own.,13
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I should not,13
NA,have taken this unusual step had I not,13
NA,"thought it important, in the interests not",13
NA,"only of the State which I represent, but",13
NA,"of the whole, of Australia, that the true",13
NA,facts in . connexion with certain matters,13
NA,"should be laid before the House, so that",13
NA,even honorable members who may be op-,13
NA,posed to the courses,13
Mr SPEAKER , I would remind the,13
NA,honorable member that he has not yet ob-,13
NA,tained leave to move the adjournment.,13
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I wish to,13
NA,move the adjournment of the House for,13
NA,"the purpose of asking that Mr Wade,",13
NA,' Chief - Engineer of Water Conservation for,13
NA,"New South Wales, who is now in Mel-",13
NA,"bourne, be called upon for a full .report",13
NA,in regard to the water supply available at,13
NA,or near Lyndhurst.,13
Mr SPEAKER , I have received an in-,13
NA,timation from che honorable member for,13
NA,Macquarie that he desires to move the ad-,13
NA,"journment of the House, to discuss a de-",13
NA,"finite matter of urgent public importance,",13
NA,"viz.. "" The desirability of obtaining fur-",13
NA,"ther information from Mr Wade, Chief",13
NA,Engineer of Water Conservation in New,13
NA,"South Wales, who is now in Melbourne,",13
NA,concerning the volume and cost of water -,13
NA,"supply at or near Lyndhurst.""",13
NA,Five honorable members having risen in,13
NA,"their places,",13
NA,Question proposed:,13
Mr THOMAS ,I s the honorable member,13
NA,stone-walling the Seat of Government,13
NA,Bill?,13
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I take all re- -,13
NA,"sponsibility for tr,y actions in this Cham-",13
NA,ber. All I ask is that the same courtesy,13
NA,may be extended to me in making this re-,13
NA,quest for information as I should be ready,13
NA,to extend to any other honorable member.,13
NA,adThe question I wish to discuss is a very-,13
NA,important one. Misleading statements have,13
NA,"been made, both publicly and privately, by",13
NA,"the advocates of other sites, for the pur-",13
NA,pose of damaging the chances' of the,13
NA,"Lyndhurst site, and I feel that' in the in-",13
NA,terests of all - concerned the Chief,13
NA,Engineer of Water Conservation in,13
NA,"New South Wales, who has been",13
NA,sent to Melbourne by his Government,13
NA,to give honorable members full information,13
NA,in regard to the possibility of conserving,13
NA,"water in the district, should be examined at -",13
NA,"the Bar of the House, or by a Select Com-",13
NA,"him mittee, on his report, which I put before",13
NA,"the House last night, so that all the facts",13
NA,relating to the matter may be ascertained.',13
NA,My action proves that I am desirous that,13
NA,the fullest publicity shall be given to all,13
NA,matters relating to the Lyndhurst site.,13
Mr THOMAS ,Th e honorable member,13
NA,made a long speech on this subject last',13
NA,night.,13
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,"Yes , but the",13
NA,accuracy of many of the statements which I,13
NA,then made on the authority of Mr Wade,13
NA,were questioned bv certain honorable mem-,13
NA,bers. I believe that a majority are desir-,13
NA,"ous of knowing the truth, and, therefore, I",13
NA,wish to give the House an opportunity to,13
NA,examine Mr Wade in a most public man-,13
NA,"ner, both on every statement which I"" have",13
NA,"made, and in regard to other matters bear-",13
NA,ing on the question at issue. Mr Wade,13
NA,has submitted a report which shows that a,13
NA,gravitation supply capable of supplying,13
NA,"100,000 people with 100 gallons per day",13
NA,throughout the year can be obtained at,13
NA,"Lyndhurst, the rate of consumption pro-",13
NA,vided for being twice that of Melbourne,13
NA,"and Sydney combined, and Mr Wade has",13
NA,"allowed for 8 per cent, to run off in the",13
NA,course of a dry year.,13
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,14
NA,ber is not asking that further informa-,14
NA,"tion shall be supplied, but is quoting state-",14
NA,ments in a report which he says is now,14
NA,available. I hope that he will confine him-,14
NA,self to the terms of his motion.,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Certai n state-,14
NA,"ments have been made, and I am anxious",14
NA,that Mr Wade shall be asked to give the,14
NA,- House full and complete information on the,14
NA,whole question. I wish other honorable,14
NA,members to have the same opportunity to,14
NA,"examine him as I have had, so that the full",14
NA,light of day shall be shed on the subject.,14
NA,In a report which Mr Wade has written to,14
NA,"-rnei and which is now in my possession, he",14
NA,says that a gravitation scheme can be,14
NA,obtained at Lyndhurst which would supply,14
NA,"100,000 people at the allowance I have al-",14
NA,ready named; and that i f more water were,14
NA,"required, a storage reservoir could be con-",14
NA,"structed on the Lachlan, just below the junc-",14
NA,tion of Wyangala Creek. The cost of the,14
NA,"work has been estimated at £581,200,",14
NA,which includes the cost of twenty-two miles,14
NA,"of steel main, one-tenth of the cost of the",14
NA,"dam, and the cost of buildings, pumps,",14
NA,"boilers, engineering, and contingencies.",14
NA,"Making provision for fuel and stores,",14
NA,"maintenance, and interest and sinking fund",14
NA,at 6 per cento the supply would cost 7jd.,14
NA,"jDer 1,000 gallons. At the present time",14
NA,the water supplied in Sydney and in Mel-,14
NA,"bourne costs is. per 1,000 gallons, while",14
NA,in some places where there are pumping,14
NA,schemes the cost is as high as is. 6d. per,14
NA,"1,000 gallons. A weir to supply the re-",14
NA,"quirements of a Capital City, estimated at",14
NA,"9,000,000 gallons per day, could be con-",14
NA,"structed for £100,000.",14
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e Standing Order,14
NA,prevents any discussion which anticipates,14
NA,debate oh an item of business already ap-,14
NA,"pearing on the notice-paper, and, therefore,",14
NA,nothing can be said now which could be,14
NA,said in Committee on the Seat of Govern-,14
NA,ment Bill. The honorable member must,14
NA,confine himself wholly to the matter to,14
NA,"which' his notice refers, the desirability of",14
NA,"examining Mr Wade at the Bar, or before",14
NA,"a Select Committee, to obtain further infor-",14
NA,mation from him regarding the possibilities,14
NA,of water supply at Lyndhurst. He will not,14
NA,be in order in saying now anything which,14
NA,could be said in Committee on the Bill.,14
NA,His present remarks are clearly suchas,14
NA,"Could be made at that stage, and, therefore,",14
NA,they are not in order.,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I am merely,14
NA,endeavouring to justify my contention that,14
NA,Mr Wade should be examined at the Bar,14
NA,of the House.,14
- Mr SPEAKER , I would point out that,14
NA,every word which the honorable member,14
NA,has uttered during the. past two or three,14
NA,minutes could be appropriately uttered upon,14
NA,the Seat of Government Bill. He seems,14
NA,rather to be showing the want of necessity,14
NA,to examine Mr Wade before the Bar of the,14
NA,House than the necessity to do so. I,14
NA,must .ask the honorable member to confine,14
NA,his remarks to the question before the,14
NA,Chair.,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I shall endea-,14
NA,vour to do so. I merely desire to point out,14
NA,that the figures supplied by Mr Wade in,14
NA,connexion with the water supply at Lynd-,14
NA,hurst have been questioned by honorable,14
NA,membeis.,14
Mr SPEAKER ,"O f course, it is not",14
NA,my business to indicate to the honorable,14
NA,"member what he ought to say, but I would",14
NA,suggest to him a line of argument which,14
NA,"would be in order, so as to contrast it with",14
NA,a line of argument which is not in order.,14
NA,"Upon a motion such as this, it would be",14
NA,perfectly competent for the honorable mem-,14
NA,ber to argue that Mr Wade knew all about,14
NA,"the locality in question, and .that his opinion",14
NA,was worth having. Any such line of argu-,14
NA,"ment would be perfectly in order, but the",14
NA,line of argument which he is following is,14
NA,not in order.,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I thoroughly,14
NA,realize the difficult position which I occupy.,14
NA,My only desire is to direct attention to the,14
NA,important statements which have been made,14
NA,"by Mr Wade, the Chief Engineer of Water",14
NA,"Conservation in New South Wales, in con-",14
NA,nexion with the water supply at Lyndhurst,14
NA,That officer has reported upon all the sites.,14
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Di d he appear be-,14
NA,fore the Commissions ?,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Yes . Nearly,14
NA,all the information upon which the Com-,14
NA,missioners based their report concerning the,14
NA,question of water supply was obtained,14
NA,from him.,14
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,I s not that in-,14
NA,formation contained in their report?,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,"No , because",14
NA,it is only recently that surveys have been,14
NA,made in connexion with the Lyndhurst,14
NA,site. Mr Wade shows very clearly that,14
NA,by constructing a weir upon the Lachlan,14
NA,he could conserve,14
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Whei e is Mr Wade,14
NA,now ?,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , H e is in Mel-,15
NA,bourne.,15
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Wh y is,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I requested,15
NA,the Premier of New South Wales to i n -,15
NA,struct him to visit Melbourne.,15
NA,HONORABLE MEMBERS -O h !,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , T h e honorregard,15
NA,able member for Hume and the honorable,15
NA,member for Eden-Monaro made certain,15
NA,statements in connexion with the Lyndable,15
NA,hurst water supply which I knew to be unthe,15
NA,"reliable, and I wished to have Mr Wade water-holes.",15
NA,here so that he might be able .to furnish,15
NA,honorable mqmbers with the fullest inbasis,15
NA,formation. A l l I ask is that he should,15
NA,"called to the Bar of the House, and",15
NA,amined upon this important question. I n gallons per dav.,15
NA,"one of his reports, Mr Wade states that,",15
NA,"even in the driest season upon record, the",15
NA,Lachlan River can be made to supply discussion.,15
NA,"135,000,000 gallons per day.",15
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ; the honorwith,15
NA,able member is again anticipating the deto,15
NA,bate upon the Seat of Government B i l l .,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I merely menthe,15
NA,tion that fact in support of my contention,15
NA,that honorable .members should be,15
NA,an opportunity o f examining Mr Wade at,15
NA,the Bar of the House.,15
Mr CULPIN ,Ca n he give more informabottle ?,15
NA,tion than he has alreadv supplied?,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , N o ; but last,15
NA,"night, upon the authority of Mr Wade,",15
NA,"made a statement, the accuracy of which",15
NA,was questioned.,15
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Wh o questioned anxious,15
NA,it?,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I t was quesbeing,15
NA,"tioned by the honorable member for Hume,",15
NA,"and the honorable member for EdenMelbourne,",15
NA,Monaro.,15
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Wha t did I say in,15
NA,reference to it?,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e honorable,15
NA,member attempted to disparage the report,15
NA,of Mr Wade. I say that that officer should,15
NA,"be examined at the Bar of the House, in",15
NA,order that honorable members may,15
NA,suppled with f u l l and accurate informa-,15
NA,tion.,15
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Th e more infor-,15
NA,mation we obtain in regard to Lyndhurst the has no right to say that.,15
NA,less number of votes will be recorded in,15
NA,favour.,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Tha t imay,15
NA,"the honorable member's view, but I am",15
NA,satisfied to rest its claims upon,15
NA,possible publicity. I f my statements can-,15
NA,not be substantiated,15
Mr KELLY , T h e honorable member is,15
NA,willing to pit Mr Wade against the writers,15
NA,he here ? ' of anonymous letters.,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I am prepared,15
NA,to do that at any time. I feel sure that the,15
NA,Prime Minister does not object to the most,15
NA,complete information being supplied in,15
NA,to all sites. I do not ask honorable,15
NA,members to accept my statement,15
Mr DAVID THOMSON ,Bu t the honor-,15
NA,member must admit that in dry seasons,15
NA,Lachlan River is merely a succession o f,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Upo n the,15
NA,"of the driest year ever experienced,",15
NA,"be namely 1901-2, Mr Wade declares that he",15
NA,"excould supply Lyndhurst with 135,000,000",15
Mr SPEAKER ,Order . Thehonor-,15
NA,able member is again anticipating another,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I n dealing,15
NA,this question it is very difficult for me,15
NA,keep within the strict limits prescribed,15
NA,by parliamentary rules. I did not accept,15
NA,verbal statement of Mr Wade in con-,15
NA,"nexion with this matter, but requested him to",15
NA,afforded submit his views in writing.,15
Mr MCLEAN , H a s he brought the,15
NA,Lyndhurst water supply with him in a,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e honorable,15
NA,member will be able to examine him i f he,15
NA,I is summoned to appear at the Bar of the,15
NA,House. I t is really wonderful to note how,15
NA,"keen are some honorable members, who are",15
NA,that a site shall be selected upon the,15
NA,"Victorian border, to prevent f u l l publicity",15
NA,given to all the facts connected with,15
NA,this question. Mr Wade is at present in,15
NA,with the consent of the New,15
NA,"South Wales Government, whom I have to",15
NA,thank for placing his services at our dis-,15
NA,posal. He is prepared to be examined at,15
NA,the Bar of the House upon the statements,15
NA,which he has made concerning the water,15
NA,supply at Lyndhurst. That fact shows that,15
NA,I do not fear the fullest light being thrown,15
NA,be by experts upon my contentions.,15
Mr BATCHELOR ,-No t i f the honorable,15
NA,member's own experts are called.,15
- Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e Minister,15
NA,I n advocating,15
NA,"its his own scheme, the honorable gentleman is",15
NA,relying upon the report of this very officer.,15
NA,be Mr Wade is no expert of mine.,15
NA,NA,15
NA,the fullest ber admitted i t just now.,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I asked the,15
NA,Government of New South Wales to grant,15
NA,honorable members the assistance of that,16
NA,officer in dealing with this question.,16
NA,NA,16
NA,hurst.,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Seein g that,16
NA,misrepresentations have been made con-,16
NA,"cerning the Lyndhurst site, I was perfectly",16
NA,within my rights in making that request to,16
NA,the New South Wales Government.,16
NA,NA,16
NA,able member disown his action?,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I do not dis-,16
NA,own it. The fact that I asked' the New,16
NA,South Wales Government to send Mr.,16
NA,Wade to Melbourne does not make him an,16
NA,expert of mine. Because the honorable,16
NA,member for Hume appointed certain gentle-,16
NA,"men as Capital Sites Commissioners, should",16
NA,I be justified in affirming that they were,16
NA,his Commissioners?,16
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Th e,16
NA,member did so.,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ," I f I did, I",16
NA,was probably quite right in one or two,16
NA,"instances. As a matter of fact, I believe",16
NA,that Mr Wade was appointed by the hon-,16
NA,orable member for Hume.,16
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I think,16
NA,was.,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,The n upon',16
NA,the argument which -has been advanced,16
NA,that officer must be the expert of the honor-,16
NA,able member. He was appointed by the,16
NA,honorable member as the best officer avail-,16
NA,able to make a report.,16
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I am not quite,16
NA,sure that I did appoint him.,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I believe that sional indignation?,16
NA,"the honorable member did. I know, at all",16
NA,"events, that he has a very high opinion",16
NA,Mr Wade's ability.,16
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Tha t is so.,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Tha t is suffipaid,16
NA,cient for mv case. Mr Wade is no more,16
NA,a friend of mine than is any other officer able information.,16
NA,in the Public Service of New South Wales.,16
NA,When I requested the New South Wales,16
NA,Government to send an expert to,16
NA,"bourne, I asked, not for Mr Wade,",16
NA,"for Mr Bloomfield, who made the original",16
NA,report.,16
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Wh y not have,16
NA,NA,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I should like,16
NA,him to be called. The New South Wales,16
NA,Government have considered i t desirable,16
NA,to offer us the assistance of their Chief,16
NA,"Engineer, and I ask that he should be who",16
NA,examined at the Bar of the House.,16
NA,Bloomfield has furnished us with valuable,16
NA,2,16
NA,"information, and has shown that by means",16
NA,"of a gravitation scheme, an adequate",16
NA,water supply could be secured at Lyndhurst,16
NA,"for a population of 87,000. Mr Wade",16
NA,"has been in communication, not only with",16
NA,"myself, but with the Prime Minister, and",16
NA,"the Minister of Home Affairs, who have",16
NA,had an opportunity to question him on this,16
NA,subject; and every honorable member should,16
NA,be afforded equal facilities to examine him.,16
NA,Damaging statements against Lyndhurst,16
NA,"have been made by opponents of that site,",16
NA,"and Mr Wade, in the interests of fair",16
NA,"play, should be examined at the Bar, in",16
NA,order that those statements may be proved,16
NA,or disproved.,16
Mr WILKS ,Dalley) - I should not have,16
NA,risen to address myself to this question but,16
NA,for the seriousness of the issue. During the,16
NA,debate last night some warm exchanges took,16
NA,"honorable place, and unless honorable members guard",16
NA,"themselves, feeling is likely to run very high",16
NA,before a site is selected.,16
NA,NA,16
NA,the evidence of outside experts.,16
Mr WILKS , I n Mr Wade we have an,16
NA,engineer who is at the head of the New,16
NA,that he South Wales Department of Water Conser-,16
NA,"vation, and who holds high rank among the",16
NA,members of his profession in Australia. I t,16
NA,"is, therefore, very desirable that we should",16
NA,have an opportunity to examine him. I do,16
NA,not wish to suggest that the honorable mem-,16
NA,"ber for Macquarie is not a good engineer,",16
NA,but his engineering skill does not relate to,16
NA,water conservation.,16
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,I s this profes-,16
Mr WILKS ,Th e honorable member,16
NA,of who interjects is an engineer of another,16
NA,type; his skill is related more particularly,16
NA,to underground work. Mr Wade is not the,16
NA,"emissary of any party, and he would",16
NA,be able to supply the House with very valu-,16
NA,"So far, the debate on",16
NA,this question has been characterized bv a,16
NA,"broad Federal spirit, but there is-a danger",16
NA,Melthat the honorable member f o r Eden-,16
NA,"but Monaro, the honorable member for Hume,",16
NA,"and others may, in a weak moment, be",16
NA,"tempted to urge, from a merely provincial",16
NA,"stand-point, the merits of the sites which",16
NA,they respectively favour. We must avoid,16
NA,"partisanship, and I think that by examining",16
NA,Mr Wade we shall remove many doubts,16
NA,that have been created in the minds o f hon-,16
NA,orable members by the assertions of those,16
NA,are opposed to the Lyndhurst,16
NA,Mr site. The honorable member f o r Mac-,16
NA,quarie simply desirea that Mr Wade,16
NA,"shall be called, in order that the allegations",17
NA,which have been made against the Lyndhurst,17
NA,water supply may be shown to be without,17
NA,foundation. No one would suggest that that,17
NA,officer would be guilty of the improper,17
NA,advocacy of any site. The only objection that,17
NA,can be urged is that i f Mr Wade were,17
NA,called the supporters of other sites might,17
NA,demand that many other experts should be,17
NA,examined at the Bar of the House.,17
NA,"have, nevertheless, to ask ourselves whether",17
NA,we are in possession of all the information,17
NA,necessary to enable us to come to a wise,17
NA,decision. I t seems to me that we are not.,17
NA,The honorable member for Macquarie,17
NA,admits that he is at a disadvantage in deal-,17
NA,"ing with the claims of Lyndhurst, in the",17
NA,absence of the expert evidence which Mr.,17
NA,Wade would be able to afford the House.,17
Mr MCLEAN , D i d he not supply,17
NA,report to the Commissioners?,17
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I t is desired to ex-,17
NA,amine him on a further report.,17
Mr WILKS , The paper submitted to,17
NA,the House last night by the honorable mem-,17
NA,ber for Macquarie is merely a -precis of Mr.,17
NA,"Wade's views, in regard to the cost of pro-",17
NA,viding Lyndhurst with an adequate water,17
NA,supply. The information which i t gives is,17
NA,"necessarily curtailed, and honorable members",17
NA,are not able to f u l l y grasp the figures. I f,17
NA,Mr Wade were summoned to appear at the,17
NA,"Bar of the House, we should obtain the",17
NA,"fullest information from him, and I trust",17
NA,that honorable members who wish to see,17
NA,this matter dealt with solely from an Aus-,17
NA,tralian point of view will not hesitate to,17
NA,agree to the request.,17
- Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Eden-,17
NA,Monaro) - I offer no objection to the pro-,17
NA,posal made by the honorable member for,17
NA,"Macquarie, although I think that by yield-",17
NA,ing to it we might create a rather dangerous,17
NA,precedent. No charge has been made,17
NA,"against Mr Wade, and, so far as I am",17
NA,"aware, there is no very special reason why",17
NA,he should be called. I understand that the,17
NA,honorable member - f o r Macquarie takes,17
NA,serious .exception to one or two interjec-,17
NA,"tions, in reference to the water supply of",17
NA,"Lyndhurst, which were made last night",17
NA,whilst he was speaking in Committee.,17
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Somethin g,17
NA,much more serious than interjections.,17
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,The n the,17
NA,honorable member ought to say what it is.,17
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable memone,17
NA,ber will not be in order in referring to,17
NA,another debate.,17
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Tha t was my diffi-,17
NA,cultv.,17
NA,M i . AUSTIN CHAPMAN - I know,17
NA,"that Mr Wade is a first-class engineer, but",17
NA,I ask whether it is desirable that we should,17
NA,call to the Bar of the House only a gentle-,17
NA,man who has furnished a report favorable,17
NA,to the selection of a certain site.,17
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I do not know any- -,17
NA,We thing about his views in that respect. That,17
NA,statement is hardlv fair.,17
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Th e re-,17
NA,ports supplied by Mr Wade are favorable,17
NA,to the selection of a certain site.,17
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,The v are fair.,17
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN , H e has ex-,17
NA,pressed a very favorable opinion in regard,17
NA,to the water supply of Lyndhurst.,17
Mr KELLY , A n honest opinion.,17
Mr WATSON ,Tha t goes without say-,17
NA,ing.,17
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN , I do not,17
NA,accept the honorable member for Wentworth,17
NA,as an authority on this subject.,17
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , Mr Wade has also,17
NA,favorablv reported on Tumut.,17
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN , H e has,17
NA,"made a favorable report on Lyndhurst, and",17
NA,for that reason the honorable member for .,17
NA,Macquarie proposes that he shall be ex-,17
NA,amined. I have no. objection to the adop :,17
NA,"tion of that course, because I am satisfied",17
NA,that Mr Wade would not make a report,17
NA,in favour of any site unless he were con-,17
NA,vinced that it was right to do so. I f we,17
NA,are going to question the value of the,17
NA,various reports which have been submitted,17
NA,"to us, we ought to examine not only Mr.",17
NA,NA,17
NA,and other gentlemen having equally high,17
NA,reputations. Surely we are not going to,17
NA,cast a slur on the high officials who have,17
NA,furnished us with reports? The honorable,17
NA,member for Macquarie. telegraphed to the -,17
NA,Government of New South Wales to secure,17
NA,"the attendance of Mr Wade in Melbourne,",17
NA,"and, knowing that that gentleman is pre-",17
NA,pared to speak in favour of the selection o f,17
NA,"Lyndhurst, he desires that he shall be",17
NA,called. Is Mr Wade to be singled out as,17
NA,the one engineer to give evidence at the,17
NA,Bar of the House? I should like to draw-,17
NA,attention to the fact' that the New South,17
NA,very,17
NA,Wales Engineering Department has been,17
NA,responsible for some terrific blunders in,17
NA,connexion with water supply. Every one,17
NA,in New South Wales is aware that some,17
NA,in that Department must be held re-,17
NA,sponsible for serious mistakes in connexion,17
NA,"with the water supplies of Bathurst, Orange,",17
NA,"Goulburn, and Armidale. I do not say",18
NA,"it was Mr Wade, but if we are to dis-",18
NA,"cuss the relative merits of engineers, we",18
NA,should have some information as to who,18
NA,was responsible for those schemes.,18
Mr WATSON , Mr Wade has only re-,18
NA,cently become Chief Engineer.,18
Mr SYDNEY SMITH,It is a very unfair,18
NA,way in which to try to damage a public offi-,18
NA,cer's reputation.,18
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,I f we,18
NA,are to decide this question by bringing,18
NA,"men to the Bar of the House, we should",18
NA,"bring a number of men, because it is a",18
NA,well-known fact .that in' connexion with,18
NA,the schemes for water supply for the,18
NA,"places I have mentioned, most glowing re-",18
NA,"ports were issued, by the Department in",18
NA,"New South Wales, as to what the rainfall",18
NA,"would be, what the conservation would be,",18
NA,and we really had in respect to those,18
NA,schemes much the same story as we,18
NA,were told last night. The places to which,18
NA,I refer have had water supplies provided,18
NA,for them on the authority of some engineer,18
NA,"in New South Wales, and in every case",18
NA,they have proved dismal failures. At,18
NA,"Orange, where we are told there is such an",18
NA,enormous catchment area for a water sup-,18
NA,"ply, the people of the little town had to be",18
NA,put on half supply in the summer before,18
NA,last. The mistakes in these cases should,18
NA,"be inquired into, and we should know who",18
NA,>vas responsible for them. I t would be a,18
NA,calamity to us i f we were guided by the re-,18
NA,port of engineers who are incompetent. I,18
NA,do not doubt the figures which were given,18
NA,"to us last night, but we want something",18
NA,more tban figures; we should have facts.,18
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Som e honorable,18
NA,members do not want the facts.,18
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN , I have not am,18
NA,"the .slightest objection to hear them,",18
NA,we are to have an officer sent here specially,18
NA,by. the New South 'Wales Government to,18
NA,"make, at the Bar of this House, certain",18
NA,"statements regarding a particular site,",18
NA,should also have an opinion from other',18
NA,"officers with regard to other sites, and",18
NA,should saddle the responsibility for the,18
NA,takes made in New South Wales in this,18
NA,connexion on the right shoulders.,18
NA,not believe that Mr Wade would make,18
NA,"such mistakes, but I refuse to allow the",18
NA,honorable member for Macquarie to inferenas,18
NA,tially saddle engineers who have reported,18
NA,favorably of sites other than Lyndhurst,18
NA,with that responsibility. I f Mr Wa.de,18
NA,"to be brought to the Bar of the House,",18
NA,NA,18
NA,reputation as his should also be heard. From,18
NA,NA,18
NA,as to what can be done at Lyndhurst. There,18
NA,"is no running water there, and the sugges-",18
NA,tions as to what can be done there in the,18
NA,way of water supply are all dependent on,18
NA,conditions and circumstances. . I f the in-,18
NA,tention is to pit one public officer against,18
NA,"another, they should all be given fair play.",18
NA,The honorable member for Macquarie cast,18
NA,some reflection upon the Commission ap-,18
NA,pointed by the honorable member for,18
NA,"Hume, only because that Commission did",18
NA,not supply him with as good a report on,18
NA,Lyndhurst as he could get from Mr.,18
NA,Wade's figures. The last thing we,18
NA,should try to do in this House is to,18
NA,pit one public officer against another.,18
NA,I f I do not agree that what Mr.,18
NA,"Wade has done is right, that is no",18
NA,reason why I should try to cast the slightest,18
NA,doubt upon his ability or his honesty. No,18
NA,one who knows Mr Wade would think of,18
NA,doing so; but he should not be brought here,18
NA,as a kind of special pleader for one site.,18
NA,That would put Mr Wade in a very false,18
NA,position. The very fact that the honor-,18
NA,able member for Macquarie telegraphed to,18
NA,have this officer brought here should be,18
NA,"enough"" to induce honorable members to",18
NA,hesitate before they agree to what has,18
NA,been proposed. We were told by the,18
NA,honorable member that Mr Wade re-,18
NA,ported that at Lyndhurst there is not,18
NA,only a Sufficient water supply for the,18
NA,"Federal City, but that there could be",18
NA,"procured 135,000,000 gallons a day for",18
NA,irrigation purposes. All I can say is that,18
NA,many of us who could not get even a drink,18
NA,"of cold water there, would be very glad to",18
NA,get such information from Mr Wade. I,18
NA,disposed to think that there is one good,18
NA,but i f reason why that gentleman should be,18
NA,. brought to the Bar of the House. He has,18
NA,"just returned from America, and the hon-",18
NA,orable member for Barrier is under the,18
NA,we impression that the report quoted must,18
NA,"be upon the Mississippi, and not upon",18
NA,"we Lyndhurst, and I think it is well that that",18
NA,misshould be cleared up. I am quite certain,18
NA,that any report by Mr Wade would be,18
NA,"I do an honest one. In my opinion, he is",18
NA,"a very competent engineer, but i f he' is",18
NA,to be brought before the Bar of the House',18
NA,the special pleader for a particular,18
NA,"site, in _ justice to other sites, we",18
NA,should also' have here some of the,18
NA,is engineers who have told us that' un-,18
NA,"less Weare prepared to spend millions, it",18
NA,a will be almost a matter of impossibility to,18
NA,get a water supply at Lyndhurst. We,19
NA,"might get water to the moon, i f we spent",19
NA,enough money. I f Mr Wade is to be,19
NA,"brought to the Bar of the House, another",19
NA,telegram should be sent to Sydney to some,19
NA,"other engineer, whose reputation is just",19
NA,"as good as is Mr Wade's, and who will tell",19
NA,us that unless we go to the expenditure of,19
NA,millions there is a risk that at Lyndhurst,19
NA,we should have more whisky than water.,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta) -,19
NA,The honorable member for Eden-Monaro,19
NA,has told us that he has not the slightest,19
NA,objection to Mr Wade appearing at the,19
NA,"Bar of the House, and he has further said",19
NA,that he believes that gentleman to be a,19
NA,"competent engineer, who would give an",19
NA,"honest opinion. I f that be so, may I ask",19
NA,what we should gain by questioning Mr.,19
NA,Wade as to the engineering failures that,19
NA,have occurred at different places in New,19
NA,South Wales in connexion with small water,19
NA,supplies.,19
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,H e might give,19
NA,us some information in respect to them.,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,"H e might,",19
NA,but what would be the advantage gained,19
NA,by asking Mr Wade's opinion upon matters,19
NA,"which did not concern him, and which are",19
NA,not connected with the question before us,19
NA,in any way ? The object could only be to,19
NA,try to influence the minds of honorable,19
NA,members adversely to Mr Wade's opinion.,19
NA,At one moment the honorable member says,19
NA,"that Mr Wade is an honest man, and in",19
NA,the next he says that we should have him,19
NA,"here"" that we may ask him about these",19
NA,failures.,19
Mr MCLEAN ,A n honest man may,19
NA,make a mistake.,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e honorable,19
NA,NA,19
NA,should be brought here i f Mr Wade is to,19
NA,be consulted. I should like to point,19
NA,that the figures quoted by the honorable,19
NA,NA,19
NA,ham's figures. Mr Wade has taken Mr.,19
NA,"Pridham's figures, and on them he has",19
NA,based his report.,19
NA,NA,19
NA,"ham's figures, he is the engineer",19
NA,"consult, and not Mr Wade.",19
NA,NA,19
NA,has said that Dalgety has a better water torate ?,19
NA,"supply than Lyndhurst can ever have, and",19
NA,Mr Wade does not agree with that.,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t is not the,19
NA,question at all. I am prepared to admit hold the same opinion of Lyndhurst.,19
NA,that there is a better water supply at Dalsubmit,19
NA,gety than at Lyndhurst; but what we are,19
NA,concerned about is to establish the fact that,19
NA,an adequate water supply may be obtained,19
NA,at Lyndhurst for all the purposes c f a,19
NA,Federal Capital. I am not concerned to,19
NA,deny that there may be better water sup-,19
NA,plies found elsewhere in New South Wales.,19
NA,"What we say is that in this neighbourhood,",19
NA,which has been so rryjch maligned by some,19
NA,honorable members in this particular re-,19
NA,"spect, there is an abundance of water, and",19
NA,more than the Federal Capital will ever,19
NA,require. I t is the more advisable that we,19
NA,should take advantage of Mr Wade's en-,19
NA,"gineering skill, as he is already in Mel-",19
NA,"bourne, and we can secure his advice with-",19
NA,out delay to the final determination of the,19
NA,question before us.,19
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,H e is in Mel-,19
NA,bourne at the request of the Lyndhurst,19
NA,site supporters.,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I do not know,19
NA,who brought him here.,19
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Th e honorable,19
NA,member for Macquarie says that he tele-,19
NA,graphed for him.,19
- Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am prepared,19
NA,to admit that. I hope the honorable mem-,19
NA,ber d i d ; i t would be but evidence of his,19
NA,industry and enterprise in this matter.,19
NA,May I remind honorable members that the,19
NA,Government of New South Wales are in,19
NA,favour of the Lyndhurst site? I submit,19
NA,respectfully that a site which is recom-,19
NA,"mended by the Government, and is to be",19
NA,recommended by the Parliament of New,19
NA,"South Wales, is entitled to their serious",19
NA,consideration.,19
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Th e New South,19
NA,Wales Government are not in favour of i t .,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Al l I have to,19
NA,say to that is that the Premier of New,19
NA,South Wales announced to the country only,19
NA,the other day that i f returned to power he,19
NA,out would ask the Parliament of New South,19
NA,Wales to recommend Lyndhurst to the,19
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,H e said he,19
NA,would leave i t an open question.,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e honorable,19
NA,we should member is quite wrong.,19
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Wh y not be f a i r,19
NA,state that Lyndhurst is in his own elec-,19
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,No t only Mr.,19
NA,"Wadclell, but all the influential members o f",19
NA,the late Government in New South Wales,19
NA,I,19
NA,that a site favoured by the Govern-,19
NA,ment of the State which has to grant the,19
NA,"land, and which has spent a very large",20
NA,sum of money in facilitating the object,20
NA,we have in view> should be considered.,20
NA,The New South Wales Government have,20
NA,sent over an engineer with a special report,20
NA,"upon the water supply at Lyndhurst, and we",20
NA,"should, in courtesy to them, hear what this",20
NA,engineer has to say. I t is the more impor-,20
NA,tant that we should hear him since we had,20
NA,last night an expert opinion adverse to,20
NA,Lyndhurst as a site from the right honor-,20
NA,able member for Swan. Nothing more,20
NA,damaging to the character of Lyndhurst as,20
NA,a suitable site for the Federal Capital could,20
NA,be urged than the opinion offered by the,20
NA,right honorable member.,20
Sir JOHN FORREST ,I t was offered some,20
NA,time ago; the report has been on the table,20
NA,for some time.,20
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am referring,20
NA,to the right honorable member's remarks,20
NA,last night. He told us that it would be,20
NA,absolutely dangerous in summer time i,20
NA,scheme suggested by this engineer were,20
NA,carried out.,20
Sir JOHN FORREST , I do not,20
NA,said that.,20
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e right honor-,20
NA,able member told us that the water stored,20
NA,"would become polluted in summer, and",20
NA,would be a source of danger.,20
Sir JOHN FORREST , I referred to,20
NA,artificial lake suggested.,20
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I could not,20
NA,imagine a more severe condemnation of the,20
NA,scheme than we had from the right honor-,20
NA,able member.,20
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Th e lake need not,20
NA,be made.,20
Mr SPEAKER , I think the honor-,20
NA,able member for Parramatta must see that,20
NA,the remarks he is making now are really but,20
NA,a continuation of the debate upon another,20
NA,question. The mere fact that he is reply-,20
NA,ing to some remarks made in that debate is,20
NA,a proof that the honorable member is trans-,20
NA,ferring to this question debate which should,20
NA,take place in Committee. I must ask the,20
NA,honorable member not to anticipate the de-,20
NA,bate in Committee.,20
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I do not. quite,20
NA,see how I can avoid it. I quite admit,20
NA,"what you say, Mr Speaker, but. on the",20
NA,"other hand, the very purpose of moving",20
NA,the motion for the adjournment of the,20
NA,House is to ask that special engineering,20
NA,skill shall be made available for the pur-,20
NA,"pose, amongst other things, of furnishing",20
NA,information concerning statements made,20
NA,during the course of the debate in,20
NA,Committee. While I know the rule,20
NA,of Parliament that an honorable mem-,20
NA,"ber cannot, upon a motion for the",20
NA,"adjournment, allude to a debate proceed-",20
NA,"ing at another time and place, in this in-",20
NA,"stance it is almost unavoidable. However,",20
NA,I will not further transgress. But I do say,20
NA,"that, in view of the very serious statements",20
NA,imade by the right honorable member for,20
NA,Swan on the question of the water sup-,20
NA,"ply of Lyndhurst, it is of the very utmost",20
NA,consequence that the House should avail,20
NA,itself of every opportunity to test their,20
NA,"truth. Leaving out of sight the advocates,",20
NA,"or partisans, as they have been called, of",20
NA,Lyndhurst-an d I do not object to the term,20
NA,- I urge that the fact that this site is about,20
NA,to be officially recommended for considera-,20
NA,tion by the Government of New South,20
NA,Wales,20
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Tha t is absurd;,20
NA,f thehalf the members of the New South Wales,20
NA,Government are against it. The honorable,20
NA,member knows that himself.,20
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,W e know nothing,20
NA,of the kind.,20
Mr DAVID THOMSON ,Lyndhurs t is in,20
NA,Mr Waddell's electorate.,20
Mr JOSEPH COOK ," I know that, but",20
NA,what has it to do with the question ? Why,20
NA,the does not the honorable member make a simi-,20
NA,lar interjection concerning sites which are,20
NA,in the electorates of other honorable mem-,20
NA,bers?,20
Mr DAVID THOMSON , The remark-,20
NA,applies to them in just the same wav.,20
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Honorabl e mem-,20
NA,bers opposite imake such interjections with,20
NA,"regard, to those who favour Lyndhurst, but",20
NA,"not concerning the advocates of other sites,",20
NA,who all along have been doing their best,20
NA,for their electorates. More power to,20
NA,them; I do not criticise them on that ac-,20
NA,count. I do not see what point there is,20
NA,in the interjection that Lyndhurst is i n the,20
NA,electorate of the Premier of New South,20
NA,Wales. Of course it is. But that fact,20
NA,would go for nothing i f the people of New,20
NA,South Wales were not behind the site.,20
NA,Since the practicability of this site has,20
NA,been challenged by an expert of the charac-,20
NA,ter of the right honorable member for,20
NA,"Swan, who believes that to construct there",20
NA,artificial works for conserving water will,20
NA,be to menace the health of the people in,20
NA,"the district, we ought to have the benefit",20
NA,of all the available engineering skill which,20
NA,has been devoted to the investigation of,20
NA,such questions. With respect to the,20
NA,"opinions of other engineers, who would",21
NA,"probably report adversely, I would remark",21
NA,that that could not be so in the case of,21
NA,"Pridham, because he furnished the figures",21
NA,"which, after checking, have been adopted",21
NA,by Mr Wade in the preparation of the case,21
NA,submitted last night by the honorable memvernment,21
NA,ber for Macquarie.,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,Boothby-Ministe r,21
NA,of Home. Affairs) - I do not know that,21
NA,Government can complain altogether of,21
NA,delay in the transaction of business which,21
NA,has been caused by this debate.,21
NA,the other hand) it is certain that the Goquest.,21
NA,vernment are not getting quite as much,21
NA,support in their endeavour to push forward,21
NA,".the settlement of the Capital Sites question,",21
NA,"as, perhaps, they had a right to expect",21
NA,from some quarters. A request has,21
NA,"submitted to-day, which, i t seems to",21
NA,the honorable member for Macquarie canmight,21
NA,not reasonably think that the House is,21
NA,likely to grant.,21
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I do not see why,21
NA,"the House should not, i f we are to have fair settle the matter?",21
NA,play.,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,Suc h a request,21
NA,should only be granted in the event of,21
NA,very serious misstatements having been,21
NA,made. I am expiessing my individual examine him.,21
NA,"opinion in this respect, but my view cer-",21
NA,tainly is that only in the case of very,21
NA,ous misstatements would i t be advisable,21
NA,call any person to the Bar of the House. sites.,21
NA,"I t is a most unusual procedure, and is very",21
NA,seldom adopted by any Parliament. I have,21
NA,never heard of its being adopted for the,21
NA,purpose of rebutting statements made,21
NA,way of interjection in the course of,21
NA,bate. 11 is a most remarkable request. A l l,21
NA,kinds of statements have been made in,21
NA,terjections and in speeches about each of information.,21
NA,the suggested sites.,21
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e honorable,21
NA,gentleman made a statement himself.,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,Doe s the honor-,21
NA,able member for Macquarie suggest that I,21
NA,made any statement that was unfair to,21
NA,Wade? I can assure him that I did not is,21
NA,for a moment mean to suggest tbat Mr.,21
NA,Wade was a partisan of any site.,21
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I do not know his,21
NA,opinion.,21
Mr BATCHELOR , I do not know his,21
NA,opinion either. I have' not the,21
NA,"idea what i t is. Indeed, I do not care.",21
NA,"He is certainly an eminent engineer, and",21
NA,to the extent that his professional skill,21
NA,titles him to receive from this House the -statements made.,21
NA,"very fullest credence, he would have that",21
NA,and no more. His professional skill is the,21
NA,. main point; his personal opinion is quite,21
NA,Mr another question. So f a r as concerns the,21
NA,information which the honorable mem-,21
NA,"ber desires to obtain, I desire to say that,",21
NA,i f Mr Wade submits a statement to the Go-,21
NA,they will take care that it is made,21
NA,available to honorable members. Surely,21
NA,nothing more than that can be desired No-,21
NA,the thing more can reasonably be asked for.,21
NA,the I f the honorable member for Macquarie,21
NA,"had put a simple question, the Government",21
NA,"But, on would at once have complied with his re-",21
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I want Mr Wade,21
NA,"to answer questions put to him, and to meet",21
NA,objections raised by honorable members.,21
Mr BATCHELOR , The honorable,21
NA,been member will see tliat i f that practice were,21
NA,"me, adopted every supporter of a Capital Site",21
NA,make a similar request. I f we are,21
NA,to have experts called to the Bar of the,21
NA,House to be examined by honorable mem-,21
NA,"bers, how long will i t probably take to",21
NA,Instead of days or,21
NA,"weeks being occupied, i t might take months,",21
NA,"or perhaps years, to settle it.",21
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I t would be bad for,21
NA,Mr Wade i f i t took so long as that to,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,Bu t there are other,21
NA,seriexperts who might also be called with just,21
NA,to as - much reason in connexion with other,21
NA,A l l that the honorable member for,21
NA,Macquarie can reasonably ask f o r is what,21
NA,I have already offered to do. I f Mr .,21
NA,Wade likes to send a f u l l statement to,21
NA,by the Government we shall be happy to,21
NA,a demake it available to honorable members.,21
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wha t we suggest,21
NA,inwould be a quicker way of securing the,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,Th e honorable,21
NA,member surely does not put that suggestion,21
NA,forward seriously?,21
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I do. indeed.,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,Wha t the honor-,21
NA,Mr able member for Macquarie really urges,21
NA,that the special engineering skill of Mr.,21
NA,Wade should be made available to honor-,21
NA,able members. I am quite prepared to,21
NA,agree to that by circulating any statement,21
NA,which Mr Wade may make.,21
Mr FOWLER ,Wh y not appoint a Select,21
NA,slightest Committee to examine him ?,21
Mr BATCHELOR ,W e should cer-,21
NA,tainly not appoint a Select Committee. I f,21
NA,enwe did that we should have all kinds of,21
NA,I suggest that the honor-,21
NA,able member should accept the undertaking,21
NA,"now given, and let the House get on with",22
NA,the discussion of the sites.,22
Mr BROWN ,Canobolas) -.Certainl y,22
NA,the course of procedure which the honor-,22
NA,able member for Maccjuarie asks the,22
NA,"Government to consent to is unusual, and",22
NA,it requires a considerable amount of reason,22
NA,to justify it. But in view of the treatment,22
NA,which the honorable member for Macquarie,22
NA,"received last night, and also in view of",22
NA,the influences at work in the House,22
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Undergroun d,22
NA,fluences.,22
Mr BROWN ,Ther e is ample justifica-,22
NA,tion for the action taken by him. What,22
NA,"is the position? First of all, we had ex-",22
NA,pert reports upon all the sites-th e western,22
NA,"sites, the southern sites, and the south-",22
NA,eastern sites. A l l the sites now mainly,22
NA,under consideration were dealt with,22
NA,by experts appointed by the honorable,22
NA,member for Hume when he was Minister,22
NA,of Home Affairs in the Barton Government.,22
NA,At the close of the debate in the last Parlia-,22
NA,ment a certain movement was made by the,22
NA,then Minister of Home Affairs for the,22
NA,purpose of supplementing the information,22
NA,"then available, and the House was given to",22
NA,understand that an inquiry was to be held,22
NA,in order to obtain some special information,22
NA,that had been overlooked on the previous,22
NA,occasion. But we find that the supple-,22
NA,mentary inquiry with regard to the Bom-,22
NA,bala and Tumut sites has been as exhaus-,22
NA,"tive as, i f not more exhaustive than, the",22
NA,inquiry entered into by the expert Commis-,22
NA,sioners. The whole question has been,22
NA,"reviewed from every possible stand-point,",22
NA,and every tittle of information which it,22
NA,was possible to obtain has been brought to,22
NA,bear. I do not object to that. The,22
NA,House should be placed in possession of,22
NA,all the information bearing upon the ques-,22
NA,tion. But the honorable member for,22
NA,Macquarie-an d I agree with him-ask s,22
NA,that a similar inquiry should be extended,22
NA,to Lyndhurst. We were refused that by the,22
NA,late Government. We were informed' that,22
NA,the information available covered all that,22
NA,was necessary. Whenever we asked that,22
NA,the same treatment as was extended,22
NA,to the other sites should be extended,22
NA,to Lyndhurst we were met by a refusal.,22
NA,When I got possession of the supplementary,22
NA,"reports about a fortnight ago, I made a spe-",22
NA,cial visit to Sydney in order to bring the,22
NA,matter under the notice of the State,22
NA,ment. I was not successful in seeing the,22
NA,State Premier. But I endeavoured to get all,22
NA,the information I could with respect to the,22
NA,Lyndhurst site. I consider that the honor-,22
NA,able member for Macquarie has done the,22
NA,right thing in endeavouring to bring the in-,22
NA,"formation up to date, and to place honorable",22
NA,members in a position to judge this site on,22
NA,the newer and wider information which is,22
NA,now available. Since the investigations,22
NA,were made by the Commission of experts-,22
NA,and these were maimy confined to a pre-,22
NA,scribed area- a considerable section of the,22
NA,people in the western districts have taken,22
NA,in- up the question of dealing with the source,22
NA,of water supply which has been reported,22
NA,"upon lately by Mr Wade, and deputations,",22
NA,"of which I was a member, have waited on",22
NA,the State Government to deal with the ques-,22
NA,"tion from a State stand-point, and not par-",22
NA,ticularly from a Federal stand-point. I,22
NA,know that I cannot enter into f u l l details at,22
NA,"this stage, but I wish to indicate that there",22
NA,is now available more information than was,22
NA,available when the Commission of experts,22
NA,"made their inquiries, and that information",22
NA,has been secured by the State Department,22
NA,for other than Federal purposes. A league,22
NA,has been formed to secure the erection of,22
NA,a weir and conservation of water for purely,22
NA,State purposes. I am a member of the,22
NA,"league, which I believe includes the Prime",22
NA,Minister and several members of the State,22
NA,Parliament. That shows that since the first,22
NA,inquiry was made the attention of the State,22
NA,Parliament has been specially concentrated,22
NA,on this source of supply for purposes of,22
NA,"water conservation, and it is admitted by",22
NA,the Ministry that it reaches the proportions,22
NA,"of a national scheme, affecting all interests",22
NA,along the Lachlan River. I wish now to,22
NA,refer to the question of Mr Wade's report.,22
NA,The honorable member for Eden-Monaro,22
NA,will not dare to rise here and question,22
NA,straight out the ability of Mr Wade to deal,22
NA,with this matter. Mr Wade is a gentleman,22
NA,who has risen from the ranks in the Public,22
NA,Service of the State until he has attained,22
NA,the position of chief officer of the Depart-,22
NA,ment of Water Conservation. But the hon-,22
NA,"orable member comes to the House, and",22
NA,points to a number of instances of waste-,22
NA,f u l expenditure by the Department in vears,22
NA,"past, and by innuendo he tries to lead",22
NA,honorable members to believe that Mr.,22
NA,Wade had something to do with the com-,22
NA,mission of those mistakes.,22
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,No t so.,22
Mr BROWN , I am glad to have the,22
NA,"Governhonorable member's denial, because Mr.",22
NA,Wade attained his position as the result of,22
NA,"those mistakes, and the officers who were re-",22
NA,' sponsible for them had to quit the service.,22
NA,Adjournment [REPRESENTATIVES.],23
NA,The present Government of New South,23
NA,Wales has decided to make the question of,23
NA,water conservation an important item in its,23
NA,programme. The people of the State realize,23
NA,the need for water conservation throughout,23
NA,"its length and breadth, and no matter what",23
NA,Government may have the control of its,23
NA,"destinies, it must be prepared to make that",23
NA,question one of the main planks of its plat-,23
NA,form in the near future. For the purpose,23
NA,of thoroughly equipping the State to deal,23
NA,"with this great question, the See Govern-",23
NA,ment sent Mr Wade on a special mission to,23
NA,"America to make inquiry and report, and he",23
NA,has only recently returned. I believe that,23
NA,there is no man in the States to-day who,23
NA,is so well posted as Mr Wade with up-to-,23
NA,date information on this subject. I f hon-,23
NA,orable members had received his report,23
NA,last night in the spirit in which they are,23
NA,prepared to receive the reports of other,23
NA,"officers,. I should have said",23
NA,on the part of the honorable member for,23
NA,Macquarie was uncalled for. But how was,23
NA,it received here? Every innuendo was,23
NA,"thrown out against it, and there were circu-",23
NA,"lated here, not only newspaper letters or",23
NA,"reports, but anonymous letters condemning",23
NA,this site as being unsuitable from the standvery,23
NA,point of water supply.,23
Mr SPEAKER ,Orde r ! The hon-,23
NA,orable member is clearly anticipating the,23
NA,debate in Committee.,23
Mr BROWN , I do not wish to do,23
NA,that. I desire to state this fact as a reason,23
NA,why some official action should be taken to,23
NA,place before the House Mr Wade's infor-,23
NA,"mation, so that honorable members may be",23
NA,satisfied that it is reliable. I understand,23
NA,Mr Wade is at present in Melbourne; I,23
NA,"have not had an interview with him, but the",23
NA,honorable member for Macquarie intimates,23
NA,that he is available to the House. I f it,23
NA,thinks that the information which was sup-,23
NA,"plied is not correct, it has the right and",23
NA,"opportunity of calling Mr Wade to the Bar,",23
NA,and questioning him.,23
Mr WEBSTER ,Wh o has thrown any,23
NA,doubt on the report?,23
Mr BROWN,"Doub t has been exthat,",23
NA,pressed all round.,23
Mr WEBSTER ,No t at all.,23
Mr BROWN,Th e honorable member,23
NA,for Macquarie was met with a running fire,23
NA,of interjections from all parts of the House,23
NA,when he was submitting the document.,23
NA,The main objection taken to the site was,23
NA,"based on the question of water supply,",23
NA,the practicability of which has been,23
NA,discredited by more than one speaker.',23
NA,(Formal).,23
NA,But I cannot deal with that now.,23
NA,I f honorable members feel that the,23
NA,"report is not the handiwork of Mr W.ide,",23
NA,"he is here, and may be questioned. I am",23
NA,not altogether favorable to the dragging,23
NA,of any public officer before the House to be,23
NA,"examined by honorable members, because",23
NA,I do not think that is a proper way to,23
NA,"elicit information, unless there is ,some",23
NA,very special reason for taking that course.,23
NA,Why should not the Government ask Mr.,23
NA,Wade to supply them with an official - re-,23
NA,port-o n which would be staked his re-,23
NA,putation as the Engineer-in-Chief of Water,23
NA,"Conservation in New South Wales, and",23
NA,"which, I believe, would be accepted by",23
NA,the large majority of honorable members,23
NA,as being substantially correct. That has,23
NA,NA,23
NA,report.,23
Mr BATCHELOR ,W e have already,23
NA,that this action agreed to that.,23
Mr BROWN , I am very pleased to,23
NA,"hear that intimation. That, I think, pretty",23
NA,well clears the way. I realize that some,23
NA,good has been done by this discussion in,23
NA,"reaching that position, because, so far as",23
NA,"I could ascertain, there seemed to be a",23
NA,strong desire not to allow this site,23
NA,"to receive the sarr,e amount of inquiry and",23
NA,investigation as has been allowed in the,23
NA,case of other sites.,23
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta) - I,23
NA,find that I unwittingly did the right,23
NA,honorable member for Swan a wrong in,23
NA,my comment on some remarks which he,23
NA,"made just now, and I ask permission to",23
NA,make the correction. I find that I did,23
NA,not read enough of his speech as reported,23
NA,"in Hansard, and had I read the words pre-",23
NA,ceding the quotation which he made from,23
NA,"his report, the matter would have been",23
NA,"clear. I find that his statement, suggest-",23
NA,ing grave menace and danger to the Capi-,23
NA,"talSite from, the water supply, relates to",23
NA,"the construction of an artificial lake,",23
NA,as a beauty spot and a water frontage,23
NA,"pure and simple, and does not relate to",23
NA,the water supply proper. Had I known,23
NA,I certainly should not have made the,23
NA,remarks I did concerning that report.,23
NA,NA,23
NA,to the remarks about the water supply of,23
NA,"Lyndhurst, I think it comes very late in the",23
NA,"day, indeed, for the honorable member for",23
NA,Macquarie and the honorable member for,23
NA,Parramatta to say that the supply of water,23
NA,there is as abundant as they try to,23
NA,make out. I was told that during the last,23
NA,drought the people there had to dig wells,23
NA,and put in drives for the purpose of get-,24
NA,"ting sufficient water, and it had to be done",24
NA,"on half-rations, too. That is the place in",24
NA,which the honorable member for Mac-,24
NA,quarie wishes to establish the Federal,24
NA,.Capital !,24
Mr BROWN ,Wher e was that?,24
NA,NA,24
NA,everywhere in the district. A most pecu-,24
NA,liar thing is that these honorable members,24
NA,want to back i t up- I shall not say by,24
NA,faked figures-b y a prejudiced report and,24
NA,for political reasons. The present Premier,24
NA,"of New South Wales has long represented,",24
NA,"ancl is now seeking to represent, a con-",24
NA,stituency in that district. H e is now fight-,24
NA,"ing for his very political existence, and I",24
NA,think it is a prostitution of parliamentary,24
NA,power on the part of the Premier of New,24
NA,South Wales to send,24
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I rise to a point,24
NA,of order. The honorable member has motion.,24
NA,staled that I have taken this course with a,24
NA,view of helping the Premier of New South,24
NA,Wales in his contest; but i t is well known,24
NA,that that honorable gentleman and I,24
NA,strong political opponents.,24
Mr SPEAKER ,Tha t is not a point of,24
NA,order.,24
NA,NA,24
NA,I made such a statement.,24
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I accept the honthe,24
NA,orable member's disclaimer; but I underhe,24
NA,stood him to imply that.,24
NA,NA,24
Mr BROWN ," I desire to know, sir,",24
NA,whether the honorable member for,24
NA,is in order in saying that the Premier of,24
NA,New South Wales has prostituted his posihonorable,24
NA,tion because he has acceded to the request he speaks.,24
NA,made to him by the honorable member for,24
NA,"Parramatta and myself, to have this infordresses",24
NA,mation supplied f o r the convenience,24
NA,honorable members?,24
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable,24
NA,"ber did not say that, and i f he had I",24
NA,sure that it would have been out of order.,24
NA,NA,24
NA,these honorable members very hard,24
NA,"deed, when they have to rise and rights",24
NA,"attribute to me"" words which I never that",24
NA,uttered. I do not care what site,24
NA,"is selected, though, of course, for many",24
NA,reasons I favour the Southern Monaro sites.,24
NA,The honorable member for Canobolas has,24
NA,referred to the past misdoings of engineers,24
NA,with respect to water supply ' in New,24
NA,South Wales. Does he wish to see that the,24
NA,sort of thing perpetuated in regard to,24
NA,Federal Capital? Although we have a,24
NA,chance of getting a water supply which we,24
NA,"know is second to none in Australia, yet",24
NA,honorable members wish to bolster up their,24
NA,"contention, and put the Commonwealth in",24
NA,the same unfortunate position that New,24
NA,South Wales is in. I do not know Mr.,24
NA,"Wade, but I have read many of his works",24
NA,"on hydraulic engineering and water supply,",24
NA,and I look upon him as one of the greatest,24
NA,authorities on those subjects in the Common-,24
NA,"wealth. But apart from that, it seems",24
NA,a very strange thing to me that the honor-,24
NA,able member for Macquarie should wish tc,24
NA,bring from New South Wales a public,24
NA,officer to give evidence on one particular,24
NA,"site. I f the honorable imember is honest,",24
NA,let him ask the House to bring Mr Wade,24
NA,here to be questioned on every site.,24
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I am quite willing,24
NA,to do that. I shall ask leave to alter the,24
NA,NA,24
NA,"Wade to the Bar of the House, let us as-",24
NA,certain who was guilty o f spending millions,24
NA,are of money in New South Wales on water,24
NA,supply works.,24
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I shall give the,24
NA,honorable member an opportunity of voting,24
NA,NA,24
NA,honorable member for Parramatta rises,24
NA,addresses the House in such a pedantic,24
NA,manner that he has assumed the position of,24
NA,"lecturemaster-general of the Government,",24
NA,or whomsoever is opposed to any scheme,24
NA,Maranrei that he brings forward.,24
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I leave that to the,24
NA,"member, who does it every time",24
NA,NA,24
NA,"the House in this style- "" How daie",24
NA,"of you do such a thing? I have spoken, and",24
NA,"that is quite enough."" I . shall not submit",24
NA,memto be dictated to by the honorable,24
NA,am not member in his role of lecturemaster-,24
NA,general. I hold an equal position in,24
NA,the Chamber with the honorable mem-,24
NA,"inber, and while I do I shall assert mv",24
NA,every time. I should like to move,24
NA,some outside expert be introduced. I t,24
NA,seems that these brethren from New South,24
NA,Wales cannot agree as to the best site.,24
NA,"A Commission, consisting of engineers",24
NA,"from each State, has dealt with the matter,",24
NA,"but they could not agree, and I fhink that",24
NA,the best' and cheapest' way to get over,24
NA,"- difficulty, will be to import an up-to-",24
NA,"the date man from America, and ask him to",24
NA,"choose a site, the Government abiding by",25
NA,his decision.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,W e do not want,25
NA,any Yankees here.,25
NA,NA,25
NA,posite have been Yankeeing all the time.,25
NA,I t is the representatives of New South,25
NA,Wales who are responsible for the delay,25
NA,which has occurred.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Tha t is as true as,25
NA,everything else that the honorable member,25
NA,has said.,25
NA,NA,25
NA,knows that it is true. Any one who reads,25
NA,the Hansard reports will see that all the,25
NA,-dissension is due to the action of the re-,25
NA,presentatives of New South Wales.,25
NA,"am willing to give my vote to-day, and I",25
NA,feel certain that the mind of every other,25
NA,"honorable member is made up, so that all",25
NA,the talk to which we are compelled to,25
NA,"listen will not influence any one, and will",25
NA,only have the effect of filling up Hansard.,25
NA,I f New South Wales members wish for a,25
NA,"site to be chosen, the sooner they allow us",25
NA,to come to a vote the better.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e honorable,25
NA,"member would give his State away, I sup-",25
NA,pose?,25
NA,NA,25
NA,"my State, or to the Commonwealth. I",25
NA,have never been a renegade. The hon-,25
NA,orable member is again assuming the part,25
NA,of dictator and lecturemaster-general. He,25
NA,knows what I mean.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I know that what,25
NA,the honorable member is uttering is not,25
NA,true.,25
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,25
NA,ber for Parramatta must withdraw that re-,25
NA,mark.,25
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I withdraw it.,25
NA,NA,25
NA,of what the honorable member says. _ I f,25
NA,honorable members opposite are so anxious,25
NA,that the matter shall be dealt with only on,25
NA,"complete information, let the determina-",25
NA,tion of the question be postponed to an-,25
NA,"other session, and let the Government take",25
NA,"the course I have suggested, of appointing",25
NA,an expert from some other country to make,25
NA,a recommendation on the subject. That is,25
NA,the easiest way out of the difficulty.,25
NA,have not taken part i n any of the picnics,25
NA,"to the various sites, nor have I visited",25
NA,any of the places named; but I have asked,25
NA,"unbiased engineers, to whom it does not",25
NA,"matter which site is chosen, and I shall",25
NA,vote on the information I have received,25
NA,from them. I f we agree to examine Mr.,25
NA,"Wade at the Bar of the House, we shall",25
NA,commence a course of procedure the effect,25
NA,of which cannot be foreseen. I n the first,25
NA,"place, Mr Wade himself will be placed",25
NA,in a very unpleasant position.,25
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , W h y ? He will,25
NA,simply be asked to tell the truth.,25
NA,NA,25
NA,will have any difficulty in telling the truth ;,25
NA,"but i f he is cross-examined, he may be",25
NA,placed in a very difficult position in re-,25
NA,gard to other professional men.,25
Mr MCWILLIAMS , L e t them stand on,25
NA,their reputations.,25
NA,NA,25
NA,surely Mr Wade cannot be asked to pub-,25
NA,I licly criticise them. I think that he should,25
NA,not be brought to the Bar. The Go-,25
NA,"vernment have said that, they are willing",25
NA,to obtain a report from Mr Wade on the,25
NA,"Lyndhurst site, or on any other site, and",25
NA,I think that that is all that is necessary.,25
Mr MCLEAN ,Gippsland) -N o one,25
NA,can blame the honorable member for Mac-,25
NA,quarie for doing all he can to place the,25
NA,site of which he is such an able and earnest,25
NA,advocate in the most favorable light. I,25
NA,wish to have the fullest information on all,25
NA,"the sites, and, therefore, I shall be pre-",25
NA,pared to support the honorable member's,25
NA,request i f he will deal with them all alike.,25
NA,"I am not a supporter of the Tooma site,",25
NA,but I know that a great many honorable,25
NA,members think well of it. We have,25
NA,"had, however, no professional report",25
NA,upon it. I f we are to examine an ex-,25
NA,pert at the Bar of the House in regard to,25
NA,"the Lyndhurst site, I am sure that the hon-",25
NA,orable member for Macquarie will admit,25
NA,the fairness of obtaining an official report,25
NA,"on the Tooma site, and of examining the",25
NA,engineer who furnishes it. at the Bar of the,25
NA,House. I f all sites are treated alike in,25
NA,"this matter, I will support the honorable",25
NA,member's proposal; but any other arrange-,25
NA,"ment would be one-sided and unfair, and,",25
NA,"therefore, could not be supported bv me.",25
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,Robertson) -,25
NA,The speech of the honorable member for,25
NA,"Gippsland was a very fair one, and it was",25
NA,to some extent on the same lines as that of,25
NA,the honorable member for Maranoa. If,25
NA,I expert officials can be brought to the Bar,25
NA,to give ' us information regarding the,25
NA,possibility of water supply at the various,25
NA,"sites, we shall be in a better position in",25
NA,choosing between those sites. A great,25
NA,opportunity will be lost i f we 'do not avail,25
NA,ourselves of Mr Wade's presence in Mel-,25
NA,bourne to examine him on the possibilities,25
NA,of the water supply at Lyndhurst.,26
NA,great discredit has been cast on certain,26
NA,publications respecting the possibilities of,26
NA,"water supply there, and as the Government",26
NA,"of New South Wales have, in the interests",26
NA,"of the Commonwealth, sent down an expert",26
NA,"to give us information on the subject, I",26
NA,"think we should call him to the Bar,",26
NA,and elicit from him what he can tell us,26
NA,about the whole matter. The course pro-,26
NA,posed by the honorable member for,26
NA,"Macquarie is, no doubt, an unusual one,",26
NA,but the House is on the eve of making a,26
NA,very momentous decision. There are in-,26
NA,stances in history of seats of government,26
NA,having been removed from one place to,26
NA,another. That has occurred even in Eng-,26
NA,land itself; But centuries will probably,26
NA,pass before any community will have before,26
NA,it a question such as that with which we are,26
NA,"now asked to deal. Therefore, it is neces-",26
NA,sary to have all possible information regard-,26
NA,ing water supply and other matters of con-,26
NA,sequence before us. While the Lyndhurst,26
NA,"site is not far from my electorate, I would",26
NA,not vote for it unless it could be shown that,26
NA,an adequate water supply could be obtained,26
NA,there. I have told my constituents so. I f I,26
NA,were convinced that the supply would be,26
NA,"inadequate, I should certainly turn my at-",26
NA,tention to some other site. What we must,26
NA,have is the best site available. I hope that,26
NA,the House will agree to examine Mr Wade.,26
NA,The Government have offered to obtain a,26
NA,"report from him, but I "" feel that more than",26
NA,that is required. We have already been,26
NA,"supplied with a great number of reports,",26
NA,and many of us will not have time to study,26
NA,"further reports. I n my opinion, all the ex-",26
NA,perts available should be brought before the,26
NA,"House, so that honorable members may ob-",26
NA,"tain from them the information they require,",26
NA,without the trouble of looking up reports,26
NA,which many of us have not the necessary,26
NA,time to read.,26
Mr WEBSTER ,Gwydir) - I cannot see,26
NA,any justification for the course proposed by,26
NA,the honorable member for Macquarie. I have,26
NA,"every respect for Mr Wade, but the fact",26
NA,that the honorable member asks that he,26
NA,"shall be examined at the Bar, when""he has",26
NA,already furnished us with a report on the,26
NA,"Lyndhurst water supply, shows that the",26
NA,honorable member is not satisfied with that,26
NA,report.,26
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I am satisfied with,26
NA,it.,26
Mr WEBSTER ,The n why examine,26
NA,"Mr Wade at the Bar of""the House?",26
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Becaus e certain,26
NA,honorable members say that they are not,26
NA,satisfied with the information which I have,26
NA,alreadv placed before the House.,26
Mr WEBSTER , I have as much con-,26
NA,fidence in Mr Wade as I have in the officers,26
NA,who occupy similar positions in the other,26
NA,States. I know that it is customary to eu-,26
NA,logize the heads of Departments upon their,26
NA,assumption of office to such an extent as to,26
NA,lead one to believe that they can be abso-,26
NA,lutely trusted to lay down perfect lines,26
NA,in regard to future administration. I f Mr.,26
NA,"Wade be examined at the Bar of the House,",26
NA,what will happen? Every honorable mem-,26
NA,ber will be afforded an opportunity of,26
NA,cross-examining him as to his qualifications.,26
NA,"I n doing so, those who are familiar with",26
NA,the blunders which have been committed,26
NA,in connexion with water conservation works,26
NA,in New South Wales will of necessity,26
NA,question him in such a way as will intro-,26
NA,duce the names of other officials,26
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I n New South,26
NA,Wales there have not been nearly the same,26
NA,number of blunders committed as have oc-,26
NA,curred in the other States,26
Mr WEBSTER , I admit that errors,26
NA,have been made in Victoria such as have,26
NA,not occurred eleswhere. I very much ques-,26
NA,tion the wisdom of summoning Mr Wade,26
NA,to the Bar of the House to give evidence,26
NA,under such conditions. The honorable,26
NA,member for Gippsland has stated the con-,26
NA,dition upon which he is prepared to sup-,26
NA,port the suggestion of the honorable mem-,26
NA,ber for Macquarie. Does he seriously con-,26
NA,tend that experts other than Mr Wade,26
NA,should be examined ? The Government,26
NA,have already indicated their willingness to,26
NA,obtain a report from him.,26
Mr JOHNSON ,I s the honorable mem-,26
NA,ber afraid to allow Mr Wade to be ex-,26
NA,amined ?,26
Mr WEBSTER , I have the same con-,26
NA,fidence in Mr Wade's report that I have,26
NA,in the reports submitted by other experts,26
NA,upon various aspects of this question.,26
NA,"Having that report before us, what more",26
NA,do we require? I t is true that expert,26
NA,knowledge is of value so far as i t relates,26
NA,to the volume of water which can be con-,26
NA,served at any of the sites. But I hold,26
NA,that the engineering blunders which have,26
NA,been committed in connexion with provid-,26
NA,ing water supplies to various country towns,26
NA,"in New South Wales, afford the most con-",26
NA,demnatory evidence of expert knowledge',26
NA,that can possibly be supplied. Not only,26
NA,' do we require to ascertain the volume of,26
NA,water which is available at each particular,27
NA,"site, but also whether i t can be conserved.",27
NA,"'Further, it is necessary for us to provide",27
NA,against such a result as has occurred at,27
NA,"Tamworth, where, after an expenditure of",27
NA,"50 per cent, in excess of the official estimate,",27
NA,there is merely an apology fo r a water,27
NA,supply to-day. We require to know the,27
NA,character of the country constituting the,27
NA,water sheds of these particular areas. A t,27
NA,Tamworth the water is conveyed to the,27
NA,"town by gravitation, but i t carries with i t",27
NA,"a certain amount of soil, the presence of",27
NA,which is a menace to the health of the,27
NA,people. I have seen that water so dis-,27
NA,"coloured, when coming through the bath-",27
NA,room tap that persons were almost pre-,27
NA,vented from using it. I t is very import-,27
NA,ant that we should know something as to,27
NA,the quality of the water which can be con-,27
NA,served. Obviously any water is useless,27
NA,which contains deleterious matter sufficient to,27
NA,render it unfit for human consumption. I f,27
NA,it be logical to summon an engineering ex-,27
NA,pert to the Bar of the House to give evi-,27
NA,dence as to the quantity of water which,27
NA,"can be conserved at any particular site, i t",27
NA,is equally logical to summon an analyti-,27
NA,cal chemist to testify to the ele-,27
NA,ments which are contained in that,27
NA,water. Is there any honorable member,27
NA,who will deny the necessity which exists,27
NA,for making such inquiry ? The honorable,27
NA,member f o r Macquarie pointed out last,27
NA,evening that a sample of the water supply,27
NA,at Orange had been subjected to an analy-,27
NA,tical test. Why was i t not taken from the,27
NA,Lyndhurst water-shed? The very fact,27
NA,that i t was obtained from Orange indicates,27
NA,a fear that the analyst's report upon a sam-,27
NA,ple taken from the Lyndhurst water-shed,27
NA,would not be satisfactory.,27
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e sample taken,27
NA,from Orange comes from a part of the,27
NA,Lyndhurst water-shed.,27
Mr WEBSTER ,Th e honorable mem-,27
NA,ber did not indicate that last evening.,27
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I informed honor-,27
NA,able members that i t was taken from one,27
NA,side of the Canobolas.,27
Mr WEBSTER , But the honorable,27
NA,member also said that the Lyndhurst water,27
NA,supply would be situated upon the other,27
NA,side of the Canobolas. The proposition that,27
NA,the water can run from one side of the,27
NA,"Canobolas into a dam upon the other, is a",27
NA,most remarkable one. Personally I am not,27
NA,prejudiced in favour of any site. I t is,27
NA,"obvious, however, that the most important",27
NA,factor in connexion with any Federal Capi-,27
NA,tal is its water supply. Without a supply,27
NA,of pure water no capital can be a success.,27
NA,I n company with the honorable member for,27
NA,"Macquarie I inspected the Lyndhurst site,",27
NA,"and endeavoured, in the limited time at",27
NA,"my disposal, to investigate the character",27
NA,"of the surrounding country, and the pos-",27
NA,sibilities of its water-shed.,27
Mr SPEAKER , Order. The time,27
NA,for the discussion of this motion has ex-,27
NA,pired. The Clerk will call on the Orders of,27
NA,the Day.,27
NA,SEAT OF GOVERNMENTBILL .,27

NA,"from 28th July, vide page 3725):",27
NA,Clause 2 (Determination of Seat of Go-,27

Mr WEBSTER ,Gwydir) -A s we are,27
NA,"now i n Committee on the B i l l , I shall not",27
NA,deal further with the question which was,27
NA,under consideration on the motion of ad-,27
NA,"journment, but shall proceed to review the",27
NA,various sites proposed. I took advantage,27
NA,of the opportunity afforded honorable mem-,27
NA,"bers to inspect the sites, not because I",27
NA,"desired a mere pleasure trip, but because I",27
NA,felt that i t was my duty as a representative,27
NA,of the people to personally investigate the,27
NA,merits of the several districts. The par-,27
NA,liamentary tours of inspection have been,27
NA,most unfairly referred to by the honorable,27
NA,member for Macquarie as mere picnicing,27
NA,"excursions, and the right honorable mem-",27
NA,ber for East Sydney has also spoken in a,27
NA,"most reprehensible way of the "" drawing of",27
NA,"corks"" which, he suggests, took place on these",27
NA,"occasions. I went to Tumut, and was con-",27
NA,vinced that it was unsuitable as a site for the,27
NA,Federal Capital. One does not need the,27
NA,assistance of an engineer to enable him to,27
NA,"judge of the conformation of the country,",27
NA,ancl to ascertain the reason why fogs pre-,27
NA,vail or a humid atmosphere exists. Any,27
NA,man possessed of ordinary common-sense is,27
NA,"able, from his experience, to determine",27
NA,these matters for himself. As the result of,27
NA,"my inspection, I felt satisfied that the sites",27
NA,in the immediate neighbourhood of Tumut,27
NA,did not possess - the characteristics es-,27
NA,sential ^to a Federal city. I recognised that,27
NA,"Tumut"" would be subject to dense fogs in",27
NA,"winter, and that in the summer months the",27
NA,atmosphere would be humid-climati c con-,27
NA,ditions that should not be associated with,27
NA,"the Federal Capital. The water supply,",27
NA,"however, would certainly be sufficient f o r",27
NA,all requirements. One could see the water,27
NA,"for himself, and that is more than can be",27
NA,said in connexion with some o f the,27
NA,other sites. I watched the stream of,28
NA,"water flowing at my feet, and was",28
NA,almost able to calculate for myself,28
NA,what would be the volume available for the,28
NA,Capital i f it were established there. I was,28
NA,"convinced, however, that the climatic con-",28
NA,ditions would not be conducive to the health,28
NA,of a large population; the country,28
NA,"which we traversed was difficult, and",28
NA,the area of suitable land available was ex-,28
NA,ceedingly circumscribed. I drew a mental,28
NA,picture of what would be the appearance of,28
NA,"the Federal Capital on this site, considered",28
NA,what facilities there would be for making,28
NA,such parks and gardens as should be found,28
NA,"in a Capital, and what area of suitable land",28
NA,"would be available for its suburbs, and ar-",28
NA,rived at the conclusion that I could not sup-,28
NA,port the selection of Tumut or of any of the,28
NA,sites in the vicinity. We then inspected,28
NA,"Batlow, which has already been favorably",28
NA,"commented upon, and found that its cli-",28
NA,matic conditions were distinctly supe-,28
NA,rior to those prevailing at Tumut. Batlow,28
NA,"occupies a more elevated position, and we",28
NA,felt that the atmosphere was altogether dif-,28
NA,ferent. I f the Capital were established,28
NA,there it would be sheltered from tbe biting,28
NA,"winds of winter, which are so prejudicial",28
NA,to health; but here again the area,28
NA,of undulating country available is cir-,28
NA,cumscribed. There was evidence of an,28
NA,abundant water supply-ver y different,28
NA,from that which would be available,28
NA,"at Lyndhurst, where a supply would have to",28
NA,be gathered from all parts of the district,28
NA,and conveyed in channels or tunnels to the,28
NA,Capital. At Batlow the supply would be,28
NA,"sufficient, not merely for domestic require-",28
NA,"ments, but to provide the necessary power",28
NA,for heating and lighting the city and,28
NA,for other purposes. I n three respects,28
NA,"-namely , climatic conditions, purity of",28
NA,"water supply, and water power available,",28
NA,I found that Batlow was all that,28
NA,"could be desired: nevertheless, it",28
NA,does not contain all the requirements,28
NA,of a Federal Capital site. I n the course of,28
NA,this pleasure trip-becaus e it was a plea-,28
NA,"sure, notwithstanding the discomforts of tra-",28
NA,"velling, to know that one was doing his duty",28
NA,to his country in inspecting these sites-w e,28
NA,visited Lyndhurst. I was in no way pre-,28
NA,"judiced against that site, but went there",28
NA,determined to do it f u l l justice. Although,28
NA,"we inspected it in the month of May, the",28
NA,road along which we travelled for some,28
NA,miles was a very dusty one. I do not wish,28
NA,to question the veracity of those who sup-,28
NA,"port the selection of this site, but we know",28
NA,that a man who is enthusiastically in favour,28
NA,of a particular district is not the best per-,28
NA,son from whom to obtain reliable informa-,28
NA,"tion in regard to it. Such men are prone, not",28
NA,"-wilfully, but unwittingly, to supply infor-",28
NA,mation that is not reliable. They look,28
NA,"only at the bright side of the picture, and",28
NA,one must therefore discount their evidence.,28
NA,We have been told of the remarkable pro-,28
NA,ductiveness of the land in the neighbour-,28
NA,"hood of Lyndhurst, and I should",28
NA,like to mention that during my visit I,28
NA,made inquiries on the subject. I know good,28
NA,country when I see it. The honorable mem-,28
NA,ber for Macquarie thinks that because he,28
NA,was reared among pumpkins he should be,28
NA,regarded as an exceptionally good authority,28
NA,on farming. I was born and reared in a,28
NA,district in the old country where scientific,28
NA,"farming, is practised, and where the occupa-",28
NA,. tions of the farmers comprise something,28
NA,more substantial that the growing of pump-,28
NA,"kins and the rearing of pigs, so that I",28
NA,should have some knowledge of agricultural,28
NA,matters. I therefore resent the suggestion of,28
NA,"the honorable member for Macquarie that,",28
NA,because he was born in the Lyndhurst dis-,28
NA,"trict, he should be better qualified to judge",28
NA,of the productive character of the country,28
NA,than is any other honorable member. In,28
NA,my youth I had an intimate experience of,28
NA,agriculture in a district where rotation of,28
NA,"crops was practised, and where one saw",28
NA,truly scientific farming. I have represented,28
NA,"a pastoral district for some years, and pre-",28
NA,sume that I should not have been returned,28
NA,to represent the interests of the people there,28
NA,i f I were incapable of properly voicing,28
NA,their aspirations and interests. I may,28
NA,also mention that I have travelled all over,28
NA,"the western district, and should therefore",28
NA,have some knowledge of its characteristics.,28
NA,I n the Lyndhurst district we find undulat-,28
NA,"ing country, practically rolling downs, but it",28
NA,is certainly not good agricultural land. I,28
NA,am strengthened in that view by the,28
NA,opinions of those who lived in this district,28
NA,"some years ago. I sought information, not",28
NA,from those who were specially interested in,28
NA,"the selection of Lyndhurst, but from a",28
NA,source which I knew would be untainted by,28
NA,personal considerations. We have been told,28
NA,that yields of 60 Bushels of wheat to the,28
NA,"acre are obtainable there, but men who at",28
NA,one time carried on agricultural operations,28
NA,in the district informed me that in reallv,28
NA,good seasons theyhad secured as much as,28
NA,"20 bushels to the acre, but that as a rule",28
NA,the return obtained by them was not suffi-,28
NA,"cient to pay for the labour of ploughing,",28
NA,"sowing, and harvesting, and to cover the",29
NA,cost of selling. That is good evidence of,29
NA,the agricultural possibilities of the dis-,29
NA,"trict. The fact that, although it is within",29
NA,"easy distance of Sydney, and is connected,",29
NA,"by rail with that centre of distribution, land",29
NA,"in the district is devoted, not to agriculture,",29
NA,"but to pastoral purposes, should be a suffi-",29
NA,cient answer to those who claim that such,29
NA,magnificent yields can be obtained from,29
NA,it. We saw paddocks which at one time,29
NA,"had been under the plough, but had since",29
NA,been turned into sheep runs. As a matter,29
NA,"of fact, the land there will carry about two",29
NA,sheep to five acres.,29
Mr TUDOR ,Th e honorable member,29
NA,has destroyed the Opposition; they have,29
NA,all left the Chamber.,29
Mr WEBSTER , I care not whether,29
NA,"they are present or absent. I am speaking,",29
NA,"not merely to honorable members, but to",29
NA,the people of Australia. I am responsible,29
NA,"to my constituents only, and I intend to",29
NA,give adequate expression to my views. The,29
NA,Lyndhurst district consists of what is ad-,29
NA,"mittedly pastoral country, and i t is de-",29
NA,cidedly uninteresting. We found a,29
NA,monotonous sameness about it-a n utter,29
NA,want of picturesqueness. Here and there,29
NA,"we saw little knolls, and a line of moun-",29
NA,"tains was dimly visible in the distance,",29
NA,but we looked in vain for water.,29
NA,I wondered why those whose duty it might,29
NA,be considered to be to point out the special,29
NA,qualifications of the site did not take me,29
NA,"to water, or show me some indications of",29
NA,water. Had it not been for the fact that,29
NA,"a thoughtful, generous soul amongst us had",29
NA,"provided us with something to drink,",29
NA,we should have been very thirsty,29
NA,whilst we were inspecting that site.,29
NA,I remained a day after the party,29
NA,"left, and went over the Canobolas",29
NA,site. I had seen the Bathurst site the,29
NA,"morning before, and I could not understand",29
NA,for the life of me why honorable members,29
NA,representing the district should go back,29
NA,upon those eligible sites in f avour of Lynd-,29
NA,hurst. When I inspected the Canobolas,29
NA,"site I found' that it was picturesque, that",29
NA,"there was good rich agricultural land there,",29
NA,and that the Lyndhurst site could not be,29
NA,compared to it. The Bathurst site also is,29
NA,miles ahead of the Lyndhurst site in suit-,29
NA,ability for a Federal Capital. I must ad-,29
NA,mit that there is some doubt about the,29
NA,"water supply, even at Canobolas.",29
NA,the information I received. I understoood,29
NA,that the water supply at Orange was near,29
NA,""" petering out "" during the last drought,",29
NA,and the people were put on short rations,29
NA,in respect of water for domestic and other,29
NA,uses. That was the only doubt I had about,29
NA,"the Canobolas site, but I did see water in",29
NA,"its vicinity, and that redeemed it in my",29
NA,mind as compared to the Lyndhurst site.,29
NA,"Some people wish to know why, as a New",29
NA,"South Welshman, I do not advocate the site",29
NA,which comes nearest to the zoo-miles limit,29
NA,from Sydney. Some' politicians may be,29
NA,"dominated by press dictation, and may not",29
NA,look at this question from a Commonwealth,29
NA,stand-point. But in this matter I shall be,29
NA,"guided first, not by what some per-",29
NA,sons may consider to be my duty,29
NA,"to my own State, but by what I",29
NA,consider to be my duty to the - Common-,29
NA,wealth. I f any man in New South Wales,29
NA,"tells me that, as a Federal member, I",29
NA,"should be parochial on this question, I",29
NA,am prepared to argue the matter,29
NA,"with him, but I am not - prepared to bend",29
NA,"to press domination, or the commands of",29
NA,"certain New South Wales members, in",29
NA,dealing with this question. I drove over,29
NA,"the Canobolas site, and i f I had to give a",29
NA,"vote for a site in the western district, I",29
NA,should give my vote every time for Orange.,29
NA,There is no comparison between it and the,29
NA,other western district sites. We left the,29
NA,"western district sites, and travelled with",29
NA,the honorable member for Eden-Monaro to,29
NA,visit the sites in his district. I may say,29
NA,that I was greatly impressed by the sites,29
NA,which we visited in the Monaro country.,29
NA,The land is possibly no better agricultural,29
NA,land than that at theLyndhurst site; but,29
NA,"from the evidence of my own senses, I",29
NA,"was satisfied that with mountains, snow-",29
NA,"falls, and adjacent rivers, there would be",29
NA,an ample supply of the purest water. It,29
NA,is quite unnecessary that any man should,29
NA,be called to the Bar of the House to cor-,29
NA,"roborate or verify a report, to that effect",29
NA,concerning the Monaro sites. There is ob-,29
NA,viously room for doubt about the existence,29
NA,of a very important factor i f it is neces-,29
NA,sary that an expert should be brought to,29
NA,the Bar of this House to say that it is pos-,29
NA,sible to provide a water supply at anv,29
NA,"given site. That, to my mind, is an indi-",29
NA,cation of absolute weakness in the claims,29
NA,of that particular-site. No expert engineers',29
NA,reports are required to prove to any man,29
NA,visiting the Monaro sites that an ample and,29
NA,pure water supply is to be found there.,29
NA,"From There is, of course, a difference between",29
NA,the sites in the Monaro district.,29
NA,Some are in my opinion better than,29
NA,others for the purposes of a Federal,29
NA,Capital. Bombala is undoubtedly a pretty,30
NA,site. There is ample room there for a,30
NA,"city, and the undulating country in the",30
NA,vicinity supplies the elements of pictures-,30
NA,queness and utility. I t has one or two,30
NA,"disadvantages, but its general features",30
NA,come very near to what is required for the,30
NA,purpose we have in view. I t must not,30
NA,be forgotten that while a good water supply,30
NA,"may be secured at Bombala, it would have",30
NA,"to be pumped at that site, and that that",30
NA,would raise the cost.,30
Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN ,Tha t cost would,30
NA,not pay the interest on the cost of provid-,30
NA,ing a water supplv for Lyndhurst.,30
Mr WEBSTER , I am prepared to,30
NA,"admit that. I f we required water power,",30
NA,as 'well as an ordinary water supply for the,30
NA,"inhabitants of the Federal Capital, the",30
NA,cost at Bombala would be consider-,30
NA,able. The first feature to be looked for in,30
NA,"choosing a site is the water supply, and",30
NA,that feature requires to be analyzed. We,30
NA,"must know the source of the supply, the",30
NA,"volume of water, its purity, and the cost",30
NA,involved in providing an adequate supply.,30
NA,"I admit that a water supply, sufficient for a",30
NA,"city of 50,000 inhabitants could be secured",30
NA,"at Bombala at a medium cost, but that",30
NA,does not meet all that I think necessary.,30
NA,I should like to have water power provided,30
NA,if it could be supplied economically.,30
NA,Although the honorable member for,30
NA,Eden-Monaro diligently explained the,30
NA,advantages of the sites in his elec-,30
NA,"torate, I could quite realize that at",30
NA,Bombala we should be likelv to suffer to,30
NA,some extent from biting winds in the win-,30
NA,"ter time. Climate is, of course, one of the",30
NA,features which must be considered in con-,30
NA,"nexion with these sites, and there are",30
NA,"varying degrees of climate, - which",30
NA,must 'be compared. We must take,30
NA,all the essential features of a site,30
NA,and ascertain the extent to which each is,30
NA,"met by different sites, i f we are to arrive",30
NA,at a proper decision. In the matter of,30
NA,"eligibility, as a site for a Federal Capital,",30
NA,I admit that Bombala presented some ele-,30
NA,ments which were not presented by sites I,30
NA,had previously visited. We drove out some,30
NA,ten miles from Bombala in order to obtain,30
NA,"some knowledge as to whence the Capital,",30
NA,"if established at that site, would draw its",30
NA,food supply. I was perfectly satisfied with,30
NA,the land that I saw. The area was some-,30
NA,"what circumscribed, but the land was. really",30
NA,good agricultural land. I t is not at present,30
NA,"utilized to any extent, because it is too far",30
NA,"from a market. When, in dealing with the",30
NA,"agricultural possibilities of various sites, the",30
NA,honorable member for Macquarie submitted,30
NA,a comparison of the areas under cultivation,30
NA,"in each district, he neglected to mention that",30
NA,distance from a market has prevented agri-,30
NA,cultural development at many of the sug-,30
NA,gested sites. He omitted to say that the,30
NA,land in the neighbourhood of the Tooma,30
NA,"site could not be profitably used, except for",30
NA,"the growth of fodder, to meet times of",30
NA,"drought, the cost of carrying agricultural",30
NA,"produce to the railway, in the first in-",30
NA,"stance, being very great, and the railway",30
NA,freight upon that produce to the mar-,30
NA,"ket being also prohibitive. I can say,",30
NA,"without fear of contradiction, that i f",30
NA,the Eden-Monaro district had a rail-,30
NA,"way, by which the people there could",30
NA,"get their produce expeditiously to market,",30
NA,the percentage of land under cultivation in,30
NA,that district would exceed the percentage,30
NA,which the honorable member for Macquarie,30
NA,quoted for the district around Lyndhurst.,30
NA,The character of fhe country adjacent to the,30
NA,"Capital Site, in respect of its productive-",30
NA,ness and its capabilities of providing the,30
NA,"necessaries of life economically, is an im-",30
NA,portant aspect. I contend that one essen-,30
NA,tial feature of any town or city is that its,30
NA,people shall have the necessaries of life at,30
NA,"first-hand,' instead of having to purchase",30
NA,them through middlemen. All the products,30
NA,necessary for sustaining human life should,30
NA,be grown as near to the city as possible. In,30
NA,this respect i recognise that the country ad-,30
NA,jacent to Bombala has much to recommend,30
NA,it. It struck me as being very peculiar that,30
NA,when we were driving down to the locality,30
NA,we should have been met not only,30
NA,"by a large number of the residents,",30
NA,but also by a large number of cattle,30
NA,which evidently had come to welcome the,30
NA,Federal party 1 Their presence was a clear,30
NA,indication of what the country would pro-,30
NA,duce and support. As an illustration of its,30
NA,"fattening qualifications, this herd of cattle",30
NA,was a revelation to me. There is one point,30
NA,"about the Bombala site, and other sites,",30
NA,which has not been touched upon in a prac-,30
NA,"tical way, although it is an essential quali-",30
NA,"fication in connexion with the Federal city,",30
NA,"namely, the provision that can be made for",30
NA,sanitation. In addition to a clear and plen-,30
NA,"tiful water supply, it is absolutely necessary",30
NA,that we should have an efficient system of,30
NA,sanitation. As one who has taken an active,30
NA,"part in municipal affairs, and who has",30
NA,studied the question in the newer suburbs,30
NA,"in New South Wales, where the initiatory",30
NA,difficulties of a sewerage system have had to,30
NA,"be faced, I am naturally interested in",31
NA,thisaspect of the subject. There is only,31
NA,one economical method of disposing of the,31
NA,"sewage of a great city, and that is by-",31
NA,"means-of a sewerage farm. Consequently,",31
NA,one point that has to be carefully consi-,31
NA,dered in connexion with establishing the city,31
NA,is whether we have in its vicinity land,31
NA,"capable of absorbing the sewage matter,",31
NA,and thereby converting what would other-,31
NA,wise be a nuisance into a beneficial factor,31
NA,the administration of the city's affairs. We,31
NA,want to be sure that when we establish our,31
NA,"sanitary system, we do not run any risk of",31
NA,polluting the very stream from which we,31
NA,receive our water supply. Possibly in the,31
NA,future engineers will discover better means,31
NA,of disposing of sewage matter than have,31
NA,been discovered in the past. Probably we,31
NA,shall learn to treat it by means of electri-,31
NA,city. That will remove some of the diffi-,31
NA,culties that have presented themselves to,31
NA,engineers hitherto. As far as I could see,31
NA,"at Bombala, the water supply, having to",31
NA,be drawn from a river adjacent to,31
NA,"the proposed site for the Federal city,",31
NA,would be in danger of contamination,31
NA,by the establishment of a sewerage farm,31
NA,within the area. Under the guidance of the,31
NA,"honorable member forEden-Monaro, I had",31
NA,"the pleasure of inspecting the district, and",31
NA,"it struck me that, this was one drawback",31
NA,"which, as a practical man, I could not get",31
NA,over.,31
Mr BAMFORD ,Tha t objection would,31
NA,applv to all the proposed sites.,31
Mr WEBSTER , I hope to show that,31
NA,it does not apply to all of them. The suc-,31
NA,cess of a municipal sewage farm is largely,31
NA,determined by the quality of the soil into,31
NA,which the sewerage matter is poured. That,31
NA,a well conducted sewerage farm is a source,31
NA,of profit is illustrated in the case of Mel-,31
NA,bourne. I saw this system worked in the,31
NA,"old country, before I came to Australia,",31
NA,"and worked in such a way that, instead of",31
NA,the sanitation of a city being a continual,31
NA,"source of annoyance to the city corporation,",31
NA,by means of a properly equipped and,31
NA,"economically managed sewerage farm,",31
NA,"thev had made it a source of revenue,",31
NA,which reduced the taxation of the people.,31
NA,"From this point of view, the sewerage",31
NA,"farm method is, I maintain, the best and",31
NA,most commendable that can be adopted.,31
NA,"On the tour to which I have alluded, we",31
NA,visited Delegate. Delegate is one of the,31
NA,sites which was submitted to the last Par-,31
NA,liament. It is in many ways a very good,31
NA,site. The surrounding country is rather,31
NA,better than at either Bombala or Dalgety.,31
NA,There is more agricultural land. But the,31
NA,formation of the country is not of such a,31
NA,character as to commend it as an ideal,31
NA,spot for a Capital city. Further than,31
NA,"that, the water supply would have to be",31
NA,secured by means of the obnoxious method,31
NA,of dams. I do not believe in a water sup-,31
NA,lily that is secured by damming. A large,31
NA,city requires for human consumption,31
NA,"in a supply of pure running water,, and, from",31
NA,this point of view the damming of water,31
NA,"in a large body, which sometimes becomes",31
NA,"stagnant, is not wise or beneficial.",31
NA,"Further than that, I calculate that the cli-",31
NA,mate at Delegate would be rather warm in,31
NA,"the summer time, judging by the latitude",31
NA,and the position of the site. Travelling,31
NA,"further, we set out to Dalgety. I t was",31
NA,"rather a tedious journey. In fact, we did",31
NA,meet with some hardships on these Federal,31
NA,""" picnics."" as they have been called. The",31
NA,driver of the vehicle in which I travelled,31
NA,lost his way; and had it not been,31
NA,that a man came to look for us with,31
NA,"a lantern, Heaven knows where we",31
NA,should have got to 1 I might not have,31
NA,been here at this moment to give my im-,31
NA,pressions as to the qualifications of the vari-,31
NA,"ous sites. But, finally, we got to our jour-",31
NA,"ney's end, as determined men generally do.",31
NA,The following morning we were treated by,31
NA,the honorable and learned member for,31
NA,Corio to an illustration of what it is pos-,31
NA,sible for a man to do in country of that,31
NA,description. Before we entered upon our,31
NA,"expedition, the honorable and learned mem-",31
NA,ber undertook to ford the Snowy River,31
NA,early in the morning with bare feet. See-,31
NA,ing that his garments were not wet when,31
NA,"he returned, I concluded that his feat af-",31
NA,forded a practical illustration as to the,31
NA,flow of water in the river at that particu-,31
NA,lar time. I do not know' whether his ob-,31
NA,"ject was to afford such an illustration, but",31
NA,certainly that was the effect of his,31
NA,achievement. The country around Dal-,31
NA,gety is not so good as the coun-,31
NA,"try at Bombala, and certainly not nearly",31
NA,so good as the country at Delegate. As,31
NA,"we travelled, we encountered huge granite",31
NA,boulders on the surface of the soil. Thev,31
NA,reminded me of the kopjes in South Af-,31
NA,"rica, behind which the Boers used to take",31
NA,shelter. Looking at the country from the,31
NA,"stand-point of defence, I thought that it",31
NA,would be an ideal spot for the shelter of,31
NA,our troops i f we ever had to encounter,31
NA,an enemv in the vicinity. But those,31
NA,granite outcrops indicated the character of,31
NA,the country. Granite country is not good,32
NA,country from an agricultural point of,32
NA,"view. One did not, therefore, come to a",32
NA,favorable conclusion as to the possibili-,32
NA,"ties of the soil, because the character of",32
NA,the soil is to a large extent indicated by,32
NA,its apparent composition. From the point,32
NA,"of view of beauty, the surroundings at",32
NA,Dalgety were magnificent. There is a,32
NA,panorama on every side. I t is a perfect,32
NA,beauty spot from an artist's stand-point.,32
NA,From every aspect a pleasant view meets the,32
NA,eye. The landscape makes the beholder,32
NA,almost long to live in the locality. With,32
NA,"the Snowy River running close at hand,",32
NA,the site possesses many of -the most im-,32
NA,portant essentials for a Federal city. When,32
NA,I saw it I felt that I hacT at last arrived,32
NA,at a place where I was sure that the Fede-,32
NA,ral Parliament could advantageously de-,32
NA,termine to settle. There was no stagnant,32
NA,"dam of water there, but a constant stream,",32
NA,"fed from the purest source, namely, the",32
NA,heavens and the melting snows. These,32
NA,are important elements in its favour.,32
NA,I recognise that it is necessary to estab-,32
NA,lish the Federal city at,32
NA,1 where there will be something to at-,32
NA,tract the tourist and the visitor- a place that,32
NA,"will be a sanatorium, a place for rest and",32
NA,recuperation to those who live in the arid,32
NA,districts- a place to which persons in other,32
NA,parts of the continent will be inclined to,32
NA,travel for purposes of health and sight-,32
NA,"seeing. I quite agree, with the right hon-",32
NA,"orable member for East Sydney that, we",32
NA,"cannot live on scenery, not even on such",32
NA,scenery as Mount Kosciusko presents. But,32
NA,I would remind him that on the other hand,32
NA,it is not desirable that we should locate the,32
NA,"Federal Capital at a dull place, where",32
NA,"there is nothing whatever of interest, and",32
NA,nothing that would make the visitor desire,32
NA,"to return, or long to remain. We certainly",32
NA,must pay regard to the element of pic-,32
NA,"turesqueness. Dalgety possesses, to a very",32
NA,"large degree, those features which would",32
NA,belikely to attract visitors. Means of,32
NA,communication is another of the important,32
NA,features. Much has been made of it by,32
NA,"the honorable member for Macquarie, who",32
NA,urges that because the establishment of the,32
NA,Federal city at Lyndhurst would not in-,32
NA,"volve an expenditure of more than £ 5 0 , 0 0 0",32
NA,"for railway connexions, honorable mem-",32
NA,bers should therefore select that site.,32
NA,But it is not a question of how many,32
NA,miles of railway would have to be con-,32
NA,"structed, but rather of whether, when the",32
NA,"railway is constructed, the returns will be",32
NA,sufficient to pay interest and create a sink-,32
NA,"ing fund. I f New South Wales, or any other",32
NA,"State, had been guided by the principle the",32
NA,"honorable member advocates, this vast con-",32
NA,tinent would not have been interlaced,32
NA,with railways. We have had to con-,32
NA,sider the possibilities which might accrue,32
NA,"from their construction, and our wise pre-",32
NA,decessors in the administration of public,32
NA,"affairs have acted in the main correctly, and",32
NA,largely for the benefit of the State. The,32
NA,lack of communication may raise to some,32
NA,extent a difficulty in the case of some,32
NA,sites as compared with others. I admit that,32
NA,"Lyndhurst has accessibility, but I cannot",32
NA,admit that that should be allowed to over-,32
NA,rule all other considerations. I cannot hon-,32
NA,estly say that Lyndhurst possesses fully any,32
NA,other of the features which are essential to,32
NA,the site for a Federal Capital. We know,32
NA,that railway communication could be pro-,32
NA,vided from Cooma to Dalgety. I t is,32
NA,also desired to have a through rail-,32
NA,"way connexion. People from Victoria,",32
NA,"South Australia, and other States de-",32
NA,"sire to be able, to go direct to the",32
NA,"a place Federal Capital, and not to be obliged to",32
NA,travel by a circuitous route. The connexion,32
NA,of that site with the Victorian railway sys-,32
NA,tem would involve a very large expenditure.,32
NA,"But, in fairness to the site and its advocates,",32
NA,it should be said that the question to be,32
NA,considered is not so much the expenditure,32
NA,of money as the character of the country,32
NA,"through which the railway would pass, and",32
NA,whether it would be an acquisition to the,32
NA,State and the Commonwealth when con-,32
NA,structed. We are dealing with a matter,32
NA,which involves far larger issues than some,32
NA,men who talk very glibly about it appear to,32
NA,recognise. I have not gone into the de-,32
NA,tails which have to be considered before,32
NA,one can arrive at an honest and just conclu-,32
NA,sion. The reports of this historical dis-,32
NA,cussion will be read when we have,32
NA,"passed away, and the wisdom or",32
NA,unwisdom of our choice will be,32
NA,criticised for generations to come. I do,32
NA,not wish my name to be linked with those,32
NA,who have jumped to a conclusion. There,32
NA,are many elements to be considered. We,32
NA,have to judge the sites from the stand-,32
NA,"points of climate, soil, quantity and purity",32
NA,"of water supply, accessibility, picturesque-",32
NA,"ness, and general adaptability. We have to",32
NA,"consider, not only those questions, but",32
NA,"the cost of resuming the lands,",32
NA,"and not their intrinsic value only,",32
NA,but also their prospective produc-,32
NA,"tive value. Leaving the Bombala sites,",32
NA,"the Coolringdon site, eight miles",33
NA,"Cooma, is very eligible from one stand-",33
NA,point. It has advantages from the stand-,33
NA,point of railway communication.,33
NA,ply of water might be got,33
NA,two sources - from the Murrumbidgee.,33
NA,and the mountains adjacent.,33
NA,site is not so precipitous,33
NA,others. It is slightly undulating,33
NA,"character, and larger in",33
NA,scope. It resembles a large table-land,33
NA,more than anything else. And from the,33
NA,stand-point of accessibility it is far prefer-,33
NA,able to the Lyndhurst site. If we are to,33
NA,judge the quality of these sites and their,33
NA,"claim to our support from that stand-point,",33
NA,"the Coolringdon site is as good as,- if not",33
NA,"preferable to, the site which has .been eulo-",33
NA,gized by the honorable member for Mac-,33
NA,quarie. I ask honorable members who in-,33
NA,"tend to vote for the Lyndhurst site, because",33
NA,it could be cheaply connected with a rail-,33
NA,"way .system, topay due regard to the",33
NA,claims of Coolringdon. Having dealt as,33
NA,"minutely as I can with the sites, I come",33
NA,to the last visit we paid.to the Tooma site.,33
NA,I had no intention of going to see the,33
NA,"site, but I felt that, notwithstanding",33
NA,"promise I had made to return to my home,",33
NA,it was an imperative duty on my part to,33
NA,make the visit in order .that I might be able,33
NA,to come to a right conclusion.,33
NA,to Tooma was not made under pleasant con-,33
NA,"ditions; the companionship was pleasant,",33
NA,but the trials of the trip were disagreeable.,33
NA,To drive seventy miles in one day is not,33
NA,"an agreeable undertaking"" in this wea-",33
NA,ther. AU along the line we,33
NA,"food for reflection, and the outlook was",33
NA,most interesting. The climate was very,33
NA,"invigorating, and as I drank in the pure",33
NA,atmosphere I wondered why any country,33
NA,of that character should be unoccupied.,33
NA,My common sense soon supplied me with,33
NA,an answer. I quickly perceived' that it was,33
NA,"unprofitable to occupy the country, owing",33
NA,to the difficulty of getting,33
NA,"to market. I then began to ask myself,",33
NA,""" By whom is this country occupied?"" I in-",33
NA,stituted an inquiry as to the number of land-,33
NA,holders between Germanton and,33
NA,and I found that for a distance of seventy,33
NA,"miles thecountry was practically held"" By",33
NA,seven firms or families. I then asked my-,33
NA,"self, "" Why, and for how long, have these",33
NA,"families held this country?""",33
NA,"that, perhaps, it might have only recently",33
NA,come into their possession by reason of the,33
NA,"failure of the previous holders. I found,",33
NA,"However, that the land was so good that",33
NA,Mr Webster.,33
NA,from its holders did not wish to let it go. I,33
NA,discovered that they could find in Austra-,33
NA,lia no better or more profitable place on,33
NA,A sup- which to pitch their tents. Why had they,33
NA,"from no desire to sell this land, Which was the",33
NA,pick of New South Wales ? Because it pro-,33
NA,This vided them with a handsome income at a,33
NA,as the minimum of expenditure. From the car-,33
NA,in riage window as we travelled through the-,33
NA,area and country we looked at beautiful scenery in-,33
NA,stead of at ring-barked timber. I n the,33
NA,"Lyndhurst district, one cannot see even a",33
NA,"forest reserve, or a place where timber could",33
NA,be conserved. Every tree has been ring-,33
NA,barked. Why ? Because every blade of,33
NA,grass that can be grown is needed for,33
NA,the succour of stock in summer and winter.,33
NA,The timber has been destroyed by the,33
NA,"hungry pastoralists, who are always ready",33
NA,"to sweep away a forest, and to sweep away",33
NA,"with it, as they often do, wealth far greater",33
NA,than the value of the land which they,33
NA,"clear, or of its products for years to",33
NA,come. We can judge of the character of,33
NA,a country by the trees which it grows in the.,33
NA,same way as we can judge of the character,33
NA,-of a man by his stature. The character,33
NA,a of a country is delineated in that way. Yet,33
NA,when we go to Lyndhurst we find only in-,33
NA,"ferior timber, and notice the absence of",33
NA,those elements which would indicate that its,33
NA,Our journey soil is capable of supporting a large,33
NA,population. Travelling towards the Tooma,33
NA,"site, I was not prepared for the surprise",33
NA,which I experienced. I was surprised to,33
NA,find that at half-past 9 o'clock at night the,33
NA,cold did not make a person shrink towards,33
NA,"found the fire, or bring into use a top-coat or a",33
NA,"rug, but invigorated him. That indicates",33
NA,the temperature and the character of the -,33
NA,"climate. On rising next morning, although",33
NA,there was ice on the shallow waters ad-,33
NA,"jacent, my comrades and I , who had to",33
NA,turn out in our pyjamas to replenish our,33
NA,"water supply, instead of being benumbed",33
NA,"by the cold, felt fresh enough to take a",33
NA,products good long walk. That is the kind of tem-,33
NA,perature that I like to find in a country-,33
NA,one which braces up and invigorates a man.,33
NA,I t is a climate like that which produces,33
NA,"Tooma, the. characteristics which we desire to see",33
NA,in our population. Next morning we,33
NA,climbed to the top of a mountain called,33
NA,"Bald Knob, I think, and although I ad-",33
NA,"mired the scenery of the Dalgety site, it",33
NA,I thought is nothing to the panoramic view spread,33
NA,"out before, us on the occasion of which I .",33
NA,am now speaking. I saw then the ideal,33
NA,"site for the Australian Capital, a site which",33
NA,"the artist could paint, and the poet could",33
NA,sing about. Honorable members opposite,34
NA,would have no trouble in securing the,34
NA,selection of Lyndhurst i f it possessed such,34
NA,scenery. We all marvelled at the beauty,34
NA,"of the prospect. Returning, we had a day's",34
NA,"journey of eighty miles, because the Par-",34
NA,liament of this great Commonwealth could,34
NA,not afford to allow its members to acquire,34
NA,information on this momentous question,34
NA,unless they travelled at top speed. There-,34
NA,"fore, we missionaries who were looking",34
NA,for a site had to hurry along as fast as we,34
NA,could. We had really to submit to a sort,34
NA,"of martyrdom, such as the Government",34
NA,"should not have expected us to undergo,",34
NA,and therefore we did not make our exami-,34
NA,nation of the district under the most favor-,34
NA,able circumstances. We had not sufficient,34
NA,time to photograph the scenery with our,34
NA,"eyes, and imprint it upon our memories.",34
NA,But I-an d I think every other member of,34
NA,the expedition was equally zealous-use d,34
NA,all my opportunities to the best advantage.,34
NA,At Welaregang we passed through beauti-,34
NA,"ful undulating country-countr y somewhat,",34
NA,"resembling that of Lyndhurst, but quite",34
NA,different in character. Beyond it is a fine,34
NA,panorama of hills. Then we saw the rich,34
NA,Murray flats. There is no denying the,34
NA,fertility of the land on the banks of the,34
NA,"Murray, and the undulating country behind",34
NA,"it is also capable of high production, i f",34
NA,"properly cultivated, as it would be i f the",34
NA,Federal Capital were located in the dis-,34
NA,"trict. In the matter of water supply, there",34
NA,"is the Murray, which winds its way through",34
NA,"the landscape, its glassy surface being",34
NA,seen here and there as one's eye,34
NA,"travels over the prospect; the Tooma River,",34
NA,"the Tumberumba Creek, and several other",34
NA,creeks which come from the Snowy Moun-,34
NA,"tains, bearing with them pure, undiluted,",34
NA,and ever-running water. We ought not to,34
NA,choose a site whose water supply will be,34
NA,derived from dams. The records show that,34
NA,townships which are so supplied are visited,34
NA,"periodically, and almost annually, with",34
NA,"epidemics of typhoid, diphtheria, and other",34
NA,"diseases. We ought not, i f by the exercise",34
NA,of a wise discretion we can avoid doing,34
NA,"so, to locate the Capital where the people",34
NA,will have to depend for their water supply,34
NA,upon storage reservoirs. I am not influ-,34
NA,enced in this matter by the-hope of gaining,34
NA,"votes, or by the fear of losing them. I f",34
NA,there were a proposed site in my consti-,34
NA,"tuency, and it were one which I did not",34
NA,"think the best, having regard to the interests",34
NA,"of the whole Commonwealth, I should vote",34
NA,"against it, even though I knew that by doing",34
NA,"so I should lose my seat in Parliament, and",34
NA,the paltry living wage of £400 a,34
NA,"year, which practically provides us with",34
NA,only enough to keep us out of the work-,34
NA,house.. I am not a surveyor. I could not,34
NA,take a theodolite or other instrument and,34
NA,"measure the heights of the hills, or deter-",34
NA,mine the fall of the water-courses. But,34
NA,I am a man of common sense and clear per-,34
NA,"ception, and when I see streams which are",34
NA,fed by 900 square miles of snow-covered,34
NA,"mountains, I know that the district through",34
NA,which they flow is provided with an endless,34
NA,supply of pure water. Surely a man can,34
NA,"believe his own eyes, and rely on his own",34
NA,judgment in such a case. But I do not object,34
NA,to the Government authorizing the most,34
NA,minute investigation into the merits of the,34
NA,Tooma site. I feel sure that i f such an,34
NA,investigation is made the district will be,34
NA,shown to be even a better one than,34
NA,I have described it to be. I am,34
NA,no more afraid of the production of,34
NA,an expert's report on the Tooma site than,34
NA,a man who is guiltless would be afraid,34
NA,of an investigation into his character.,34
NA,Knowing the advantages possessed by the,34
NA,"site, I welcome such a report. But,",34
NA,although experts may put before us,34
NA,"scientific calculations, and statements of",34
NA,"quantities, volumes, heights, and so on,",34
NA,I shall never be guided entirely by their,34
NA,judgment. I have seen too many monu-,34
NA,ments to the incapacity of experts to be,34
NA,ready to sink my own judgment. In the,34
NA,electorate which I represented in the New,34
NA,"South Wales Parliament, £32,000 was ab-",34
NA,solutely wasted by experts who were with-,34
NA,out practical knowledge of the conditions,34
NA,under which their work was being done.,34
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Wher e ?,34
Mr WEBSTER ,A n attempt was,34
NA,made to divert the water from the Big,34
NA,"River, in the Moree district, into the bil la-",34
NA,"bongs and dry creeks lower down, in order",34
NA,to supply a large area of waterless coun-,34
NA,try. A weir was therefore constructed at,34
NA,"great cost, and the work was -splendidly",34
NA,carried out - Ttwas a credit to the. men,34
NA,who were responsible for it. But the,34
NA,experts who designed it forgot that they,34
NA,were dealing with black soil country hav-,34
NA,"ing a gravelly bottom, with the result that",34
NA,the first flood - washed the whole thing,34
NA,"away, and thousands of pounds were",34
NA,wasted. Facts like that make one careful,34
NA,about accepting implicitly the statements,34
NA,"of experts. ""Once bitten, twice shy.""",34
NA,"Personally, I shall never take the opinion",35
NA,of experts unless it is corroborated by that,35
NA,"of other experts, and commends itself to",35
NA,my own judgment. I t does not matter lo,35
NA,me whether the Capital is located on the,35
NA,borders of Victoria or somewhere near,35
NA,"Queensland. Accessibility is, of course, a",35
NA,"consideration, but it is not the chief con-",35
NA,sideration. I n time to come the artificial,35
NA,boundaries between the States will be,35
NA,"swept away. Why, then, should we not",35
NA,"put aside all parochial considerations, and",35
NA,regard the question with a broad sweep of,35
NA,"view, as one affecting the future of a great",35
NA,nation? I f honorable members wish to,35
NA,"rise to the position of patriots, they will",35
NA,"not be guided by parochial considerations,",35
NA,and they will not pass judgments upon,35
NA,sites which they have not seen. I t is,35
NA,always the man who knows least who is,35
NA,the most confident. But those who have,35
NA,not taken advantage of the opportunities,35
NA,afforded by the Government to visit the,35
NA,"various proposed sites, and are governed by",35
NA,the narrow parochial views of the press in,35
NA,"their own States, are not the men who can",35
NA,be trusted to come to a right decision on,35
NA,this question.,35
- Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I have,35
NA,been taught to watch the man who boasts,35
NA,of his own honesty.,35
Mr WEBSTER ," I , am nojt boasting",35
NA,of my honesty; I have never had need to,35
NA,do so. I f the honorable member occupies,35
NA,"a different position, he has my sympathy.",35
NA,"I have never had to parade my honesty,",35
NA,and I hope that I shall never have to do,35
NA,so.,35
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e honorable,35
NA,member has been parading it for the last,35
NA,half-hour.,35
Mr WEBSTER , I do not think that,35
NA,any impartial member will say that I have,35
NA,"tried to be unjust to any one, but",35
NA,it will not redound to the credit of,35
NA,honorable members i f they vote for,35
NA,a site which they have not person-,35
NA,ally inspected. I challenge anybody,35
NA,who has visited the Tooma site to,35
NA,say that it does ncyt f u l f i l all essential taminated.,35
NA,conditions. I claim that it is in every way,35
NA,suited to the purposes of a Federal Capital.,35
NA,There is adequate land surrounding it to,35
NA,permit of the erection of suburban resi-,35
NA,"dences, and the soil itself is capable of",35
NA,producing everything that is necessary for,35
NA,"the support of a city. A t very little cost,",35
NA,a series of artificial lakes could be con-,35
NA,"structed, with a view to beautifying the",35
NA,Capital. Rows of trees could be planted,35
NA,for the purpose of affording shelter in the,35
NA,"summer, and flowers could be grown in",35
NA,abundance. I n the immediate vicinity the,35
NA,snow-clad mountains rise before one as,35
NA,far as the eye can reach. I t is possible to,35
NA,"gaze at those mountains, with the sun glis-",35
NA,"tening upon them at one moment, and im-",35
NA,mediately afterwards to turn round and,35
NA,behold orange trees growing to perfection.,35
NA,Do honorable members require any other-,35
NA,proof of the excellence of the climate ? I n,35
NA,"determining the location of a Capital Site,",35
NA,it is important that we should know which,35
NA,way the wind blows.,35
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e political wind?,35
Mr WEBSTER , I took the precaution,35
NA,to ascertain which way the wind blows at,35
NA,"Tooma, both in the winter and in the sum-",35
NA,"mer. The climate is admirable, and the",35
NA,country and its surroundings are beau-,35
NA,tiful. Do we not all understand what,35
NA,constitutes the main attraction of the,35
NA,watering places of the British Isles? Is it,35
NA,riot the scenery; and is not that attraction,35
NA,world-wide? I f we select the Welaregang,35
NA,"site, there will be no need for tourists from",35
NA,the old world to visit New Zealand or Tas-,35
NA,mania in search of beauty spots. They will,35
NA,always be able to spend their leisure at the Seat of,35
NA,"the Federal Government. Of course, I am",35
NA,thinking of the stream of visitors who will,35
NA,continue to be attracted to Australia when,35
NA,"we shall have passed away, when our popu-",35
NA,"lation shall have learned how to til l the soil,",35
NA,how to apply scientific methods to produc-,35
NA,"tion, and when land which is now regarded",35
NA,as valueless shall have become one of our,35
NA,best assets. There will then be millions of,35
NA,"people settled upon our territory, where to-",35
NA,day there are only thousands. I have en-,35
NA,deavoured faithfull y to outline a picture-,35
NA,"a perfect picture, perfect because it is that'",35
NA,of Nature-o f the Welaregang site. I t pre.,35
NA,sents a scene such as no painter ever trans-,35
NA,ferred to canvas. I t must be seen to be ap-,35
NA,"preciated. So far as sanitation is concerned,",35
NA,provision could easily be made there for the,35
NA,establishment of a sewerage farm without,35
NA,any fear of the water supply becoming con-,35
NA,"Further, I will undertake to",35
NA,say that any railway which is constructed,35
NA,to that site will practically pay from the,35
NA,"outset. Consequently, that question presents",35
NA,no difficulties. But there is still another,35
NA,feature upon which we might well bestow,35
NA,our attention. The surrounding country,35
NA,presents vast mineral possibilities. Tumut,35
NA,"and Tumberumba have already produced,",35
NA,"and are still producing, a large quantity of",35
NA,gold. We all know that wherever alluvial,35
NA,gold has been washed down valleys between,36
NA,"mountains, it is only a matter of time",36
NA,when the source of the deposits will be dis-,36
NA,"covered. Mr Holtermann, who was a",36
NA,"mining expert, and who made so much",36
NA,"money at H i l l End, was so convinced of the",36
NA,existence of auriferous reefs in this locality,36
NA,"that before he died he had, by means of a",36
NA,"tunnel, penetrated into a hill a distance o f",36
NA,"600 feet, in an endeavour to cut some of",36
NA,these reefs. That work only stopped,36
NA,with his decease. I f by the construction,36
NA,of a railway to the Tooma site we can,36
NA,open up avenues of employment which will,36
NA,recoup the Treasury for the money ex-,36
NA,"pended, and at the same time impart a",36
NA,"stimulus to mining, that consideration should",36
NA,constitute another of its recommendations.,36
NA,I am not here to favour or to seek favour,36
NA,from any one. I am not here to placate,36
NA,"any honorable member, but to do my duty",36
NA,"according to my lights, and to express as",36
NA,"plainly as possible the views which I hold,",36
NA,so that they may be recorded for future,36
NA,reference by those who may have hereafter,36
NA,to criticise my actions. The resumption,36
NA,of the land in this district would be a pro-,36
NA,fitable undertaking. I n the territory which,36
NA,I favour we should have a large area of,36
NA,productive land. I n dealing with this,36
NA,question we have to consider not so much,36
NA,the price of the land as its productivity.,36
NA,The true value of land can be determined,36
NA,only in that way. I t is better to pay £ 5,36
NA,"per acre for land, 100 acres of which is",36
NA,"sufficient to support a man and his family,",36
NA,"than to pay £ 2 ios. for a tract of country,",36
NA,"on 1,000 acres of which it would not be",36
NA,possible for a man to make a living for,36
NA,himself and those dependent on him. I n,36
NA,dealing with this question we must look,36
NA,"into every detail, and consider all the ele-",36
NA,ments that are essential to a Federal Capi-,36
NA,"tal. I f we do, we shall come to a satis-",36
NA,"factory decision; i f , on the other hand,",36
NA,"we are guided only by ex. parte statements,",36
NA,I fear that an error will be committed. I,36
NA,have done my best to impartially place be-,36
NA,"fore the Committee the views that I hold,",36
NA,and I fear no report that may be asked for,36
NA,in reference to the territory which I favour.,36
NA,"The honorable member for North Sydney,",36
NA,"when discussing this question last week, re-",36
NA,ferred to the possibility of beautifying a,36
NA,"district by artificial means, and spoke of",36
NA,what England had accomplished in this,36
NA,direction. Does not that suggest that the,36
NA,honorable member has in view a site in,36
NA,which it would be necessary to endeavour,36
NA,by artificial means to make good in some,36
NA,respects the natural beauty that it lacks?,36
Mr DUGALD THOMSON , I do not know,36
NA,of any such site.,36
Mr WEBSTER ,Wil l any one tell me,36
NA,that any effort on the part of man could,36
NA,supply the equivalent of natural beauty?,36
NA,Nature cannot be successfully imitated.,36
NA,"Natural, rather than artificial, beauties,",36
NA,constitute the chief attractions of England.,36
NA,"I know, of course, that they have many",36
NA,magnificent gardens and parks in the old,36
NA,"land, for I have visited them myself; but",36
NA,none of them compare with the' natural,36
NA,"scenery with, which the Almighty has",36
NA,"blessed the, country. No snow-capped",36
NA,mountain ridge meets the eye of the visitor,36
NA,to Lyndhurst. Could the honorable mem-,36
NA,ber for North Sydney supply that defi-,36
NA,ciency? Lyndhurst gives no promise of,36
NA,even great artificial possibilities. We,36
NA,should certainly not be able to make any,36
NA,artificial lakes in the district- a feature,36
NA,which would be sadly missed. Those who,36
NA,urge that any deficiency in natural beauty,36
NA,may be made good by art cannot,36
NA,"mean what they say, or i f they do",36
NA,they have given no consideration to the,36
NA,cost that would beinvolved in supplying,36
NA,"even a poor imitation. I n conclusion, I",36
NA,earnestly and sincerely appeal to hon-,36
NA,orable -members to endeavour to do that,36
NA,"which will redound to our credit, and to",36
NA,lay aside all parochial considerations. I f,36
NA,honorable members have not seen the site,36
NA,"which I have just described, there is yet",36
NA,time for them to do so before we arrive at,36
NA,a determination. Those who have neg-,36
NA,lected every opportunity to inspect these,36
NA,"sites, and are disposed to support the",36
NA,selection of a district merely because it is,36
NA,in the vicinity of Sydney-quit e unmind-,36
NA,f u l of its disadvantages-shoul d pause be-,36
NA,fore they give their vote. The Sydney,36
NA,press appears to echo the statements made,36
NA,by certain politicians in this House. I t is,36
NA,marvellous how the echoes of this debate,36
NA,are heard in New South Wales. We are,36
NA,told in the Sydney press that representa-,36
NA,tives of New South Wales are fighting,36
NA,against the interests of that State; but I,36
NA,"care not for the press of Sydney, or of any",36
NA,"other place, nor shall I have regard to",36
NA,any party consideration in dealing with,36
NA,"this question. I have a duty to perform,",36
NA,and shall do it even at the peril of losing,36
NA,my seat in this Chamber. Whatever may,36
NA,"be the result, I shall have the satisfaction",36
NA,of knowing that I have endeavoured tp do,36
NA,"my duty to my constituents, to the State",36
NA,"from which I come, and to the Common-",37
NA,wealth ; and with that knowledge I shall be,37
NA,happier than will be those who have not,37
NA,endeavoured to deal with this question on,37
NA,broad and general lines.,37
Mr RONALD ,Southern Melbourne) -,37
NA,I t is not usual for an honorable member to,37
NA,compliment the speaker who has just pre-,37
NA,"ceded him, but I could not proceed to dis-",37
NA,cuss this question without referring to the,37
NA,"magnificent, eloquent, poetic, and graphic",37
NA,speech which has just been made by the,37
NA,honorable member for Gwydir.,37
NA,should we be i f every honorable member,37
NA,who went forth to inspect the Capital,37
NA,"Sites had something of the, vision and",37
NA,"the faculty divine to see as he saw,",37
NA,and to describe as he,37
NA,"scribed, the districts which we visited.",37
NA,We all feel grateful to the honorable mem-,37
NA,"ber for his earnest, able, graphic, and im-",37
NA,partial estimate of the various sites which,37
NA,"have been submitted for our inspection,",37
NA,and from which we have now to make a,37
NA,"selection. There are one or two points,",37
NA,"which have not yet been touched upon, not-",37
NA,withstanding all that we have heard.,37
Mr MCWILLIAMS , A s with the Queen,37
NA,"of Sheba, the half has not been told.",37
Mr RONALD ,Exactly .,37
NA,"take a retrospective view, and to ask the",37
NA,Committee to look back at the experience,37
NA,of the world. I n dealing with this ques-,37
NA,tion we are not groping in the dark; we,37
NA,have the experience' of the world for our,37
NA,guidance. I t has been said again and,37
NA,again that the Federal Capital will be a,37
NA,"small and insignificant city, and Washing-",37
NA,ton is the model which has been continu-,37
NA,ally held up to our view.,37
NA,think that this is correct. I believe that,37
NA,"the Federal Capital will be a great city,",37
NA,and that we should make provision for a,37
NA,much larger population than is generally,37
NA,anticipated. I t is bound to be not only,37
NA,"the political, but the social centre of Aus-",37
NA,tralian society. That is the opTnion which I,37
NA,have formed from a review of the experi-,37
NA,ences of the world. I look back at the,37
NA,"capital of my own native land, Edin-",37
NA,"burgh, to me the prettiest city in the world",37
NA,"-th e modern Athens, far surpassing",37
NA,ancient Athens. Prior to the union of,37
NA,"Scotland with England, and to the re-",37
NA,"moval of the Parliament to London, Edin-",37
NA,burgh had a galaxy of witty men and,37
NA,"pretty women, a society of which no other",37
NA,country in Europe could boast the like.,37
NA,With the removal of the Legislature to,37
NA,"London, that society left, and the grand",37
NA,old residences of Murray House and Holy-,37
NA,rood were given over to vagrants and,37
NA,to rats. Doubtless a new Edinburgh,37
NA,"has arisen on the site of the old, but",37
NA,"the great lesson we learn is this: , that when",37
NA,the legislative power was shifted to Lon-,37
NA,"don, our gentry and money-spending me-",37
NA,"dium went with it, with the result that the",37
NA,grand old mansions have gone into disre-,37
NA,"pair, and are now the habitation of rats.",37
NA,When I look at Dublin I see exactly the,37
NA,"Happy same state of affairs. Donnybrook, which",37
NA,is now a by-word for all that is rowdy and,37
NA,"tatterdemalion, was once the centre of the",37
NA,"bright, witty, sparkling society of Ireland.",37
NA,"When the Irish Parliament was taken away,",37
NA,has de- the Irish gentry followed their legislators,37
NA,"to London, and that part of one of the",37
NA,brightest cities in the world has been de-,37
NA,populated of its society. When 1 speak of,37
NA,"society, I mean not that lackadaisical",37
NA,dilettanteism which indulges in afternoon,37
NA,"teas and dinner parties, but the society",37
NA,"which makes a nation-it s literature, its art,",37
NA,"its law, and its politics. A l l these went",37
NA,with the removal of the capital. The deduc-,37
NA,tion that I wish to draw from these facts,37
NA,is that the Federal Capital will be the,37
NA,.centre of society. The representative o f,37
NA,I wish to the Crown will reside there. This will,37
NA,"doubtless be a great source of attraction,",37
NA,and the city will become a very large and,37
NA,important one. We must consequently take,37
NA,care that the area is not circumscribed. I t,37
NA,is for this reason that I think that the,37
NA,site which was last described in the excel-,37
NA,lent speech of the honorable member for,37
NA,Gwydir would provide the greatest accom-,37
NA,"modation for a large, important, beautiful,",37
NA,I do not and great centre of Australian life-th e,37
NA,centre of all that is highest and best and,37
NA,noblest in our civilization. There are,37
NA,other considerations which must not be for-,37
NA,gotten. There is the natural beauty of en-,37
NA,vironment which Bombala possesses as well,37
NA,as the series of natural fortifications which,37
NA,are to be found round it. We know that,37
NA,nowadays i t is unwise that the capital,37
NA,"should be a seaport town, in view of the",37
NA,"great facilities for bombardment, and",37
NA,"the old sentiment still remains, that i f",37
NA,"the capital has fallen, the country is cap-",37
NA,"tured. We should see to it . that our city,",37
NA,"wherever it be, is not on the seaboard. It",37
NA,must not be exposed to the danger of bom-,37
NA,"bardment, but must be supplied with a",37
NA,series' of natural fortifications that will,37
NA,make it impregnable. The city where the,37
NA,archives of our nationality will be preserved,38
NA,should be one in which we shall be able to,38
NA,hold out against all-comers. This is one,38
NA,of the advantages possessed by the site,38
NA,described by my honorable friendpihe Eden,38
NA,"revivified, which he has depicted. I t",38
NA,for this reason that I return to my first Zealand at no distant date.,38
NA,"love, Bombala, and find i "" it advantages",38
NA,which no other site possesses. I t has,38
NA,"port at a respectable distance, and",38
NA,certainly be beyond the reach of even the people of New Zealand.,38
NA,most accurate long-distance guns on vesthat,38
NA,sels entering the harbor. The series,38
NA,of natural fortifications along the road,38
NA,which we traversed would make i t simply,38
NA,"impregnable, no matter how strong the foe",38
NA,tryght be. We should find there the bala and Tooma.,38
NA,natural means of protection which exist in,38
NA,"South Africa, for between the coast and",38
NA,town of Bombala there are kopjes and,38
NA,other natural fortifications which would,38
NA,make it possible for the capital to hold,38
NA,"out against any enemy. Then, again,",38
NA,possesses other advantages. I t has been,38
NA,said that accessibility is a very important,38
NA,"feature, but I go further,",38
NA,say that it is the all-important feature.,38
NA,Some honorable members appear to me to,38
NA,considering the selection of a Federal Capimembers to visit that site.,38
NA,tal Site to meet the existing requirements,38
NA,the Federation; but it ought not to be,38
NA,gotten that this Commonwealth is but in its,38
NA,"infancy, and what its future proportions",38
NA,may be no man can accurately prophesy.,38
NA,One needs not to be a prophet to say that,38
NA,this Federation will never be complete,38
NA,until New Zealand is in it. That result,38
NA,may not be brought about immediately; future Federal Capital.,38
NA,but that there will be some kind of,38
NA,"tion in respect of Defence, Customs,",38
NA,"such matters, between Nexv Zealand and Aus-",38
NA,tralia is as certain as that to-morrow's sun,38
NA,will rise. This should not be overlooked Eden.,38
NA,in considering the important feature of ac-,38
NA,cessibility. I n this view the Bombala and,38
NA,the Upper Murray sites are unquestionably,38
NA,the most central. We know that electricity,38
NA,"is certain to be the great force of the future,",38
NA,and an indispensable requirement of the,38
NA,Federal Capital Site is a cheap and,38
NA,ready means of generating that force.,38
NA,I f it has to be generated by coal,38
NA,it is most expensive; but i f the,38
NA,generating force is water we can have,38
NA,electric light and power provided,38
NA,the cheapest possible manner.,38
NA,two sites which provide the water power,38
NA,necessary for generating electricity,38
NA,bala and the site on the Upper Murray.,38
NA,I n each of these cases it would be,38
NA,practically drawn from Mount Kosciusko:,38
NA,I trust that honorable members will not over-,38
NA,"look the element of accessibility, and that,",38
NA,in making their selection of a site for the,38
NA,"Federal Capital, they will contemplate a",38
NA,is partnership of the Commonwealth with New,38
NA,I am sure,38
NA,that every rational and fair-minded,38
NA,a overture made in that direction will,38
NA,would meet with a ready response from the,38
NA,I have said,38
NA,the site chosen should be naturally,38
NA,impregnable and capable of defence with-,38
NA,out the risk of great loss of human life.,38
NA,I f these important qualifications are borne,38
NA,in mind the selection must lie between Bom-,38
NA,I have not seen the,38
NA,"latter site, but I have had the privilege of",38
NA,the inspecting the Bombala site. The elements,38
NA,essential for the support of a great city,38
NA,-an d I believe the Federal Capital will,38
NA,be a great city-ar e to be found at the site,38
NA,"it of my first choice, Bombala. I am free",38
NA,to admit that my affections have been some-,38
NA,what won by the descriptions of the Upper,38
NA,and Murray site to which I have listened. I,38
NA,wish that I had been able to avail myself,38
NA,be of the opportunity afforded to honorable,38
NA,I hope that,38
NA,of honorable members will not allow any pro-,38
NA,forvincialism or any State antipathies to in-,38
NA,fluence their choice. I f they do the child',38
NA,unborn may yet rue the selection made to-,38
NA,day. I n my opinion there are only the,38
NA,"two places which, from the point of view",38
NA,"of science, sociology, and common sense, are",38
NA,entitled to be considered in ' selecting the,38
NA,I have not yet,38
NA,federawavered in my affection for Eden; its,38
NA,and very name suggests an ideal site.,38
Mr KNOX ,W e were turned out of,38
Mr RONALD ,"Tha t is so, but we",38
NA,"found another Eden in Edinburgh, and",38
NA,i f in Australia we can improve upon that,38
NA,"we shall have the ideal city, the golden city,",38
NA,"and may it be, i f not the Eternal City, a",38
NA,lasting city. But we should view-this mat-,38
NA,"ter seriously and soberly, and in view of",38
NA,New Zealand forming a part of our great,38
NA,"federation, Eden port will be about as near",38
NA,"tlie centre of the Federation, from the point",38
NA,"in of view of accessibility, as we can get.",38
NA,The only I t has been said that we require an agri-,38
NA,cultural area for the Federal Territory.,38
NA,are BomWe do not require an agricultural area;,38
NA,"what we need isa horticultural area, and",38
NA,I have' seen no better horticultural area,38
NA,than the district around Bombala. Some-,39
NA,thing has been said about the grazing pro-,39
NA,"perties of that district, and I need only",39
NA,say that the stock it produces is a guaran-,39
NA,tee as to that. I ask honorable members,39
NA,to remember the essential elements re-,39
NA,"quired, and to rid themselves of petty pro-",39
NA,vincial jealousies. We have no objection,39
NA,to the selection being expedited as much,39
NA,"as possible, but we deprecate undue haste.",39
NA,Time is not wasted in making necessary in-,39
NA,"quiries, and in that connexion we should all",39
NA,"be very thankful, especially to the honorable",39
NA,"member for Hume, for the opportunities",39
NA,afforded honorable members to visit the,39
NA,"various sites suggested, that they might",39
NA,not give a vote in the dark. I am sure,39
NA,the honorable gentleman made arrange-,39
NA,ments for those visits purely in 'the in-,39
NA,terests of the selection of the most suitable,39
NA,"site. Personally, I can say that he has",39
NA,never in any way sought to influence me,39
NA,to vote for a particular site. Victoria and,39
NA,New South Wales are not the only States,39
NA,concerned in the selection we make. We,39
NA,should remember the long distances which,39
NA,honorable members representing Western,39
NA,Australia and Queensland will have to,39
NA,"come, and the dreary railway journeys they",39
NA,must make. I n their interests we should,39
NA,see that the site selected is as central as,39
NA,"possible, and we should not forget that",39
NA,it is important to know which line of rail-,39
NA,way with a uniform gauge would be most,39
NA,profitable. I am convinced that i f all the,39
NA,elements to which I have referred are,39
NA,"taken into account, and the question is",39
NA,dealt with impartially and without preju-,39
NA,"dice or provincialism, the choice must lie",39
NA,between the Upper Murray and the Eden-,39
NA,Monaro sites.,39
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Hume) - I un-,39
NA,derstood that there was no intention to go,39
NA,to a division on the clause to-day. Many,39
NA,honorable members who wish to speak,39
NA,have gone away with that understanding.,39
NA,I shall occupy more than the half-an-hour,39
NA,"that is left to us, and, i f possible, I should",39
NA,prefer not to speak to-day. I am aware that,39
NA,the honorable member for Grampians is also,39
NA,very anxious to speak before any decision,39
NA,is come to. I hope the Government will,39
NA,not allow the clause to go to a division,39
NA,when there is such a small attendance of,39
NA,honorable members.,39
Mr BATCHELOR , I t is not proposed sired to do so.,39
NA,now to ballot for particular.sites.,39
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I f we pass,39
NA,clause 2 there will be no necessity for a,39
NA,ballot. I t would be altogether against the,39
NA,general understanding to go to a division,39
NA,on this clause to-day. I know that re-,39
NA,"quests have , been made that there",39
NA,should be twenty-four hours' notice,39
NA,given before a division is taken.,39
NA,We might as well adjourn now. I do not,39
NA,"wish to commence a speech to-day, and",39
NA,finish on Tuesday. I should prefer to say,39
NA,all I have to say on the same day. The,39
NA,honorable member for Gwydir has made a,39
NA,"most eloquent speech, and one which has",39
NA,"been unequalled in this debate, and other",39
NA,honorable members are not inclined to pro-,39
NA,ceed to-day.,39
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,North Syd-,39
NA,ney) - I agree with the honorable member,39
NA,for Hume that as.a division is not to be,39
NA,taken to-day the clause cannot be passed,39
NA,as it stands. I wish to know f 10m the Go-,39
NA,vernment what procedure they intend to,39
NA,adopt with regard to the amendment that,39
NA,will be necessary i f we are to substitute,39
NA,another site for that which is mentioned in,39
NA,the Bill? Is it proposed that all the words,39
NA,"after "" shall be"" be omitted, creating a",39
NA,blank which will be filled up by another,39
NA,"name; or, is it intended to substitute an-",39
NA,other site forthwith? There must be an,39
NA,opportunity to make sure that the site which,39
NA,is finally inserted is supported by a majo-,39
NA,rity of the House. I f the Government,39
NA,have made up their minds as to the pro-,39
NA,"cedure to be adopted, it is just as well that",39
NA,they should inform the Committee.,39
Mr BATCHELOR ,Boothby-Ministe r,39
NA,of Home Affairs) -Th e Government do not,39
NA,ask the Committee to come to a division,39
NA,"to-day, but as we have not yet reached the",39

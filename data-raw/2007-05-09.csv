NA,Second Reading,19
Mr FARMER ,Macarthur-,19
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,19
NA,"Education, Science and Training) (9.01",19
NA,am)-I move:,19
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,19
NA,The measures in this bill are a further dem-,19
NA,onstration of the government's commitment,19
NA,to older Australians and carers. These,19
NA,changes ensure that the people of Australia,19
NA,share in the economic prosperity that they,19
NA,"have helped to create. In addition, several of",19
NA,the measures will enhance the quality of life,19
NA,"for many ageing veterans, especially those",19
NA,"with a disability, or their war widows or",19
NA,widowers.,19
NA,"As with past bonus payments, these new",19
NA,payments will be paid in the majority of,19
NA,cases before the end of the financial year.,19
NA,These payments are possible because of the,19
NA,"government's record budget surpluses, which",19
NA,have delivered this capacity to give extra,19
NA,support to these members of the Australian,19
NA,community.,19
NA,The first payment provided by this bill,19
NA,will go to older Australians. A 2007 one-off,19
NA,payment of $500 will be made to each per-,19
NA,son of age pension age who is qualified for,19
NA,utilities allowance or seniors concession al-,19
NA,lowance on 8 May 2007. Recipients at that,19
NA,"date of mature age allowance, partner allow-",19
NA,ance or widow allowance will also attract the,19
NA,one-off payment.,19
NA,Older Australians not actually receiving,19
NA,the stipulated payment on budget night will,19
NA,still get the bonus if they had made a claim,19
NA,by that date and subsequently have their,19
NA,payment backdated to cover that date.,19
NA,Self-funded retirees will not miss out on,19
NA,the bonus payment-they will receive $500,19
NA,"per person if they are, on that same date,",19
NA,qualified for seniors concession allowance.,19
NA,Carers are the second group targeted by,19
NA,this bill.,19
NA,Carers receiving carer income support on,19
NA,8 May 2007 in the form of a social security,19
NA,carer payment or carer service pension under,19
NA,the Veterans' Entitlements Act will be paid a,19
NA,"$1,000 one-off payment. Carers who receive",19
NA,the non-means tested social security income,19
NA,supplement known as carer allowance in ad-,19
NA,dition to either wife pension or a partner ser-,19
NA,vice pension under the Veterans' Entitle-,19
NA,"ments Act will also be paid a $1,000 one-off",19
NA,payment. Any carer receiving carer allow-,19
NA,ance will be paid a separate $600 one-off,19
NA,payment for each eligible care receiver. Car-,19
NA,ers who have claimed the targeted payments,19
NA,on or shortly before 8 May 2007 and are sub-,19
NA,"sequently granted those payments, with ef-",19
NA,"fect from 8 May 2007 or earlier, will receive",19
NA,the one-off payments.,19
NA,Carers whose children qualify for a carer,19
NA,allowance health care card only will not be,19
NA,eligible for bonus payments of $600. Carers,19
NA,who claim carer allowance after 8 May 2007,19
NA,and whose payment is backdated due to the,19
NA,application of the carer allowance backdating,19
NA,provisions will not be eligible for the bonus,19
NA,"payment, even though the backdated period",19
NA,will have included payment for 8 May 2007.,19
NA,Neither of the special one-off payments,19
NA,provided by this bill will be subject to in-,19
NA,"come tax, nor will either count as income for",20
NA,"social security, veterans entitlements or fam-",20
NA,ily assistance purposes.,20
NA,The third group assisted by the measures,20
NA,in this bill are veterans and war widows and,20
NA,widowers.,20
NA,The bill provides for a once-only compen-,20
NA,sation payment to veteran and civilian pris-,20
NA,oners of war interned by enemy forces in,20
NA,"Europe during World War II, or their surviv-",20
NA,ing widows or widowers. The government,20
NA,has previously made once-only compensa-,20
NA,tion payments to persons interned by the,20
NA,Japanese and the North Koreans. Prisoners of,20
NA,war of enemy forces in Europe also experi-,20
NA,"enced extreme brutality and starvation, and",20
NA,suffered from some of the same diseases that,20
NA,affected prisoners of war of the Japanese.,20
NA,These payments are in addition to the special,20
NA,level of benefits POWs and their widows,20
NA,"already receive, including automatic eligibil-",20
NA,ity for a gold card and eligibility to receive a,20
NA,war widow's pension.,20
NA,The bill will also amend the Veterans' En-,20
NA,titlements Act 1986 to increase the maximum,20
NA,amount of funeral benefit payable from,20
NA,"$1,000 to $2,000. By doubling the benefit we",20
NA,are making a greater contribution towards,20
NA,the cost of funerals.,20
NA,"In addition, the bill will increase the",20
NA,amount of the intermediate rate disability,20
NA,rate paid under the Veterans' Entitlements,20
NA,Act by $25 per fortnight and the amount of,20
NA,special rate disability pension by $50 per,20
NA,"fortnight. More than 29,000 veterans with a",20
NA,disability who receive special and intermedi-,20
NA,ate rate pensions will benefit from increases,20
NA,to their fortnightly payments. The pension,20
NA,increase will provide a substantial boost to,20
NA,the ability of disability pension recipients to,20
NA,manage their day-to-day challenges.,20
NA,"Finally, the bill will also extend the",20
NA,maximum period for backdating of war,20
NA,widow or widower pension from three to six,20
NA,months in certain circumstances. For those,20
NA,eligible war widows and widowers who,20
NA,claim within six months of the death of their,20
NA,"veteran partner, the war widow or widower",20
NA,pension will be backdated to the day after the,20
NA,date of death of the veteran. The extension of,20
NA,time to the permissible backdating period,20
NA,will allow those dependants of veterans who,20
NA,are not automatically eligible for the war,20
NA,widow or widower pension more time in,20
NA,which to lodge a claim for the pension and,20
NA,will ensure that they are not financially dis-,20
NA,advantaged during such a difficult time.,20

Mr DUTTON ,Dickson-Minister for,20

NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,20
NA,"As announced in the 2007-08 budget, this",20
NA,bill will make amendments to the Superan-,20
NA,nuation (Government Co-contribution for,20
NA,Low Income Earners) Act 2003 to double the,20
NA,government co-contribution in respect of,20
NA,contributions made during the 2005-06 in-,20
NA,come year.,20
NA,Take the example of a person who earned,20
NA,"under $28,000 in 2005-06 and who boosted",20
NA,their retirement savings by contributing,20
NA,"$1,000 to superannuation out of their take-",20
NA,home pay. Provided they met the other eligi-,21
NA,bility criteria they would have already re-,21
NA,ceived a government co-contribution of,21
NA,"$1,500.",21
NA,This person will now receive an extra,21
NA,"$1,500 government contribution.",21
NA,"They have turned their initial $1,000 into",21
NA,"$4,000, turbocharging their retirement sav-",21
NA,ings. This amount will remain invested in,21
NA,"their superannuation account, growing over",21
NA,time until they are ready to retire.,21
NA,In the majority of cases the additional co-,21
NA,contribution will be paid to superannuation,21
NA,funds before 30 June 2007. Remaining,21
NA,amounts will be paid in 2007-08.,21
NA,This measure will result in an extra $1.1,21
NA,billion being paid directly into the superan-,21
NA,nuation accounts of lowto middle-income,21
NA,Australians. This is in addition to the $2 bil- Act 1990.,21
NA,lion of government co-contributions that,21
NA,have already been paid into superannuation,21
NA,under this highly successful scheme.,21
NA,This time last year the government an-,21
NA,nounced the most significant changes to Aus-,21
NA,"tralia's superannuation system in decades,",21
NA,including extending the government,21
NA,co-contribution scheme to the self-employed.,21
NA,"In addition, the income thresholds for the co-",21
NA,contribution scheme will be indexed next,21
NA,financial year in line with growth in wages.,21
NA,These measures are made possible by this,21
NA,government's continuing strong record of,21

NA,Bill read a first time.,21
NA,Second Reading,21
Mr BILSON ,Dunkley-Minister for,21
NA,Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the,21
NA,Minister for Defence) (9.12 am)-I move:,21
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,21
NA,This bill seeks to further extend the operation,21
NA,of the Defence HomeOwner Scheme (the,21
NA,"scheme), from 31 December 2007 to 30 June",21
NA,2008. The legislative basis for the scheme is,21
NA,the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance),21
NA,Late last year parliament approved the De-,21
NA,fence Force (Home Loans Assistance),21
NA,"Amendment Act 2006, which extended the",21
NA,operation of the scheme from 31 December,21
NA,2006 to 31 December 2007.,21
NA,The extension of the end date was re-,21
NA,quired to enable Defence enough time to,21
NA,review the current scheme and develop a,21
NA,home ownership assistance scheme that is,21
NA,more contemporary to meet the needs of both,21
NA,Defence and ADF members.,21
NA,Defence has completed its review of home,21
NA,ownership assistance and the terrific results,21
NA,were announced last night by the govern-,21
NA,are ment as part of the 2007-08 budget. In es-,21
NA,"sence, the new scheme will have a value of",21
NA,$864 million over 10 years. It is important,21
NA,that this new scheme is supported as it pro-,21
NA,vides ADF members with assistance to,21
NA,"achieve home ownership, recognising the",21
NA,difficulty members may have in purchasing a,21
NA,home due to the nature of their career. This,21
NA,will have a significant retention benefit to the,21
NA,"ADF, as it is a targeted measure involving",21
NA,progressively higher loan subsidies for those,22
NA,who serve beyond critical separation points.,22
NA,"In essence, the new scheme will replace",22
NA,"the old home loans assistance scheme, which",22
NA,we are seeking to extend with this bill. It will,22
NA,provide contemporary and relevant home,22
NA,loan assistance pitched at a level that reflects House:,22
NA,current prices. It will also provide increasing,22
NA,entitlements as members serve beyond key,22
NA,"exit points, based on a 37.5 per cent interest",22
NA,subsidy of a three-tiered loan subsidy limit:,22
NA,"four years, up to $160,000-which translates",22
NA,"to about $241 a month-eight years, up to",22
NA,"$234,000-which is about $353 per month-",22
NA,"and 12 years, up to $312,000, which is cur-",22
NA,rently about $470 per month. It will be re-,22
NA,sponsive to changes in the housing market,22
NA,and it will provide flexibility and choice-,22
NA,giving the ADF member choice of mortgage,22
NA,providers instead of requiring a single pro-,22
NA,"vider, as was the case under the old scheme.",22
NA,The extension that I seek today will allow,22
NA,time for action consequent to the govern-,22
NA,ment's announcement to appropriately for-,22
NA,malise the introduction of the new scheme. I,22
NA,seek to further extend the end date of the,22
NA,current scheme from 31 December 2007 to,22
NA,30 June 2008.,22
NA,The extension will provide the National,22
NA,Australia Bank with continuance of its exist-,22
NA,ing rights as sole loan provider under the act,22
NA,"until 30 June 2008, however, and more im-",22
NA,"portantly, will ensure that ADF members'",22
NA,eligibility to home ownership assistance is,22
NA,preserved. I commend the bill to the House.,22

NA,use of Digital Radio Broadcasting,22
NA,(DAB); and,22
NA,(c) that trials on DRM and compression,22

NA,and,22

The SPEAKER,Before the debate is re-,22
NA,"sumed on this bill, I remind the House that it",22
NA,has been agreed that a general debate be al-,22
NA,lowed covering this bill and the Radio Li-,22
NA,cence Fees Amendment Bill 2007.,22
Mr CREAN ,Hotham) (9.16 am)-,22
NA,"Before the adjournment last night, I was",22
NA,making the point that we support our going,22
NA,digital but arguing for our amendment to the,22
NA,second reading motion for the Broadcasting,22
NA,Legislation Amendment (Digitial Radio) Bill,22
NA,2007 on the basis that the government does,22
NA,not have the framework right for us to do,22
NA,that. We see the need for the development of,22
NA,digital radio because it is an integral part of,23
NA,"the digital media landscape. However, if we",23
NA,"are to embrace it, it is essential that all Aus-",23
NA,"tralians embrace it, not just those in the",23
NA,"tal cities. Hence, the amendment we have",23
NA,moved seeks a deferral until we have estab-,23
NA,"lished the means, technologies and frame-",23
NA,work for ensuring the coverage of this digital,23
NA,reach to the whole of Australia.,23
NA,It is interesting that the Minister for,23
NA,"ans' Affairs, in the second reading speech,",23
NA,mouthed the words that this will be a tech-,23
NA,nology and a platform available to the whole,23
NA,of the country. He talks about ‘equitable ac-,23
NA,cess to new services in broadcasting for peo-,23
NA,ple living in rural and remote' areas of the,23
NA,"country. However, the bill requires that digi-",23
NA,tal be rolled out only for state capital cities,23
NA,and that this has to happen before 1 January,23
NA,"2009, but when it comes to the consideration",23
NA,"of technology for the regions, that will not be",23
NA,completed until a review of appropriate,23
NA,"technologies by 2011-in other words, a re-",23
NA,view up to three years later.,23
NA,The reason we have moved the amend-,23
"ment, Mr SPEAKER ",and you would be aware,23
NA,of it because you represent a rural commu-,23
NA,nity-is that we want to ensure that the tech-,23
NA,nologies and platforms that are developed,23
NA,"are compatible, that they extend to all the",23
NA,"regions, that regions do not miss out or that",23
NA,they do not end up having to purchase more,23
NA,"costly equipment because, on the basis of",23
NA,"what the capital cities have rolled out, tuners",23
NA,and receivers are equipped to receive only,23
NA,what is appropriate for them and their tech-,23
NA,nology but not what will subsequently be,23
NA,needed for the regions.,23
NA,We know from the bill's explanatory,23
NA,memorandum that the platform being talked,23
NA,of as being available for the cities is not ap-,23
NA,propriate for the regions. The bill establishes,23
NA,the problem; the explanatory memorandum,23
NA,confirms that the technology in question is,23
NA,not appropriate for the regions. That is why,23
NA,we do not quibble with the need to go digital;,23
NA,we are saying it has to be a digital reach for,23
NA,"capi- the whole of the country, not just for the",23
NA,capital cities.,23
NA,I urge the regions and rural communities,23
NA,to agitate to ensure that they are not left be-,23
NA,"hind. Quite frankly, this legislation can leave",23
NA,them behind. They should be aware of what,23
NA,Veteris inherently involved in this legislation.,23
NA,They should look seriously at the amend-,23
NA,"ment we have moved, which is asking for a",23
NA,deferral until such time as technologies are,23
NA,"compatible, so that we can move forward for",23
NA,the whole of the country.,23
NA,I said at the outset that we support going,23
NA,digital and we do that because it will help us,23
NA,meet the real challenges of an increased au-,23
NA,dience expectation. Digital radio is more,23
NA,"efficient than analog, AM-FM, and more",23
NA,stations can be broadcast within the same,23
NA,spectrum. What will that mean? It will mean,23
NA,"greater diversity, greater choice and greater",23
NA,"competition when it comes to news, current",23
NA,affairs and entertainment. It will expand lis-,23
NA,tener choices and this is critically important.,23
NA,"As we all know, radio is the lifeblood of",23
NA,those who spend time in the regions. People,23
NA,spend a lot time in cars and at home. This is,23
NA,"their connection, in many ways. It is about",23
NA,news and it is about connecting communi-,23
NA,ties.,23
NA,The digital approach also will provide bet-,23
NA,ter services with minimal interference and,23
NA,"signal fading, better quality, described as",23
NA,‘compact disc quality sound' and much better,23
NA,reception. You will be able to tune into a ra-,23
NA,dio station using its name only. You will be,23
NA,able to tune to programs on stronger fre-,23
NA,quencies when travelling. This is all terrific,23
NA,"stuff. Whilst we welcome digital radio, it is",23
NA,essential that we get the framework for its,23
NA,introduction right. That means ensuring that,23
NA,people in capital cities and people in rural,23
NA,and regional Australia will have the same,24
NA,access.,24
NA,We have had experience already with the,24
NA,"regions being left behind the capital cities,",24
NA,and that is when it comes to broadband. Who,24
NA,has stepped in to propose the policy alterna-,24
NA,"tive? Labor, with its Broadband Connect. It",24
NA,"has taken the view, because we have read the",24
NA,"evidence, quite frankly, that the regions that",24
NA,already have access to fast-speed broadband,24
NA,over the internet are the regions that are go-,24
NA,ing ahead. Those that do not have it are being,24
NA,"left behind. Governments have to step in,",24
NA,either to address the market failure or by,24
NA,"regulation, to ensure that the access and the",24
NA,platforms are available to them. This gov-,24
NA,ernment has not done so in the case of,24
NA,"broadband, and it is not doing so in relation",24
NA,to the spread of digital.,24
NA,This bill does not adequately address the,24
NA,roll-out of the enhanced radio services to,24
NA,people in regional Australia. I will remind,24
NA,the House again of what is contained in our,24
NA,"second reading amendment. In particular, I",24
NA,remind those members on the other side of,24
NA,the parliament who represent rural and re-,24
NA,gional Australians. We note in our second,24
NA,reading amendment that the Senate commit-,24
NA,tee inquiry into the bill did not allow inter-,24
NA,ested parties time to consider and draft sub-,24
NA,"missions to the committee, and that this con-",24
NA,straint did not allow for meaningful consulta-,24
NA,tion. So this is another rushed job-a rushed,24
NA,job that is so typical of the way in which this,24
NA,government has moved forward.,24
NA,The second reading amendment also notes,24
NA,that this has led to a lack of information as,24
NA,how the omission of the digital radio,24
NA,mondiale-DRM-platform from the legis-,24
NA,lation will affect the roll-out of digital radio,24
NA,"to rural and regional Australia, and notes that",24
NA,the legislation only specifies the use of the,24
NA,"other platform, digital radio broadcasting, or",24
NA,DAB. So the legislation only specifies DAB.,24
NA,It does not talk about DRM. It defers that for,24
NA,later consideration. The government says it,24
NA,"will look at that later, but why not look at it",24
NA,now? Why should we be taking precipitate,24
NA,decisions in the absence of knowledge about,24
NA,the technology and platforms that will enable,24
NA,us to take that regional opportunity?,24
NA,Our second reading amendment also de-,24
NA,mands that the government make every en-,24
NA,deavour to ensure that the standards are in,24
NA,place to enable the roll-out of digital radio to,24
NA,"remote, rural and regional Australia. Many of",24
NA,"these communities, as I said before, rely on",24
NA,"radio, particularly the ABC. The bill's ex-",24
NA,planatory memorandum notes that the suc-,24
NA,cess of the introduction of digital radio will,24
NA,depend on the take-up of the system by,24
NA,broadcasters and the public. We heard last,24
NA,"night from the member for Moreton, who",24
NA,talked about radio broadcasters welcoming,24
NA,this bill. I notice he did not talk about what,24
NA,the ABC had to say about this. One would,24
NA,"have thought, if we were talking about re-",24
NA,"gional and rural Australia, that we would",24
NA,take some notice of what the national broad-,24
NA,caster has to say-a national broadcaster,24
NA,whose reach is almost 100 per cent through-,24
NA,"out the whole of Australia, and which does",24
NA,provide a service for the totality of the coun-,24
NA,"try, not just for the capital cities of the coun-",24
NA,try.,24
NA,I remind the House what the ABC had to,24
NA,say about this matter. It made specific rec-,24
NA,ommendations relating to the roll-out of digi-,24
NA,tal radio to rural and regional Australia. The,24
NA,ABC has indicated that it believes the only,24
NA,to technology being referred to in the legisla-,24
NA,"tion, the digital radio broadcasting, otherwise",24
NA,"known as the Eureka 147 platform, will not",24
NA,"adequately service rural, regional and remote",24
NA,areas. That is not what the Labor Party has,24
NA,"said; that is what the ABC has said, in its",24
NA,"submission to the Senate committee inquiry,",24
NA,yet this legislation is proceeding and the,24
NA,government is ignoring that advice. The,24
NA,"DAB standard, the standard that is provided",25
NA,"for in this legislation, was prescribed by the",25
NA,minister in October 2005 as the primary plat-,25
NA,"form, but at the time it was also recognised",25
NA,that additional standards such as DRM were,25
NA,required to address regional and remote area,25
NA,coverage. Even the minister understands the,25
NA,deficiency of the platform being prescribed,25
NA,in this legislation.,25
NA,The ABC went on to say that a wide-area,25
NA,digital radio standard should be determined,25
NA,before the provisions of the bill are put in,25
NA,"place. In other words, the ABC is saying,",25
NA,‘Defer this legislation until we get it right.',25
NA,That is what Labor is saying; that is what our,25
NA,amendment is saying. The bill omits the digi-,25
NA,tal radio mondiale platform. The bill ignores,25
NA,the warnings and recommendations of the,25
NA,"ABC. The ABC notes that, if DRM is ulti-",25
NA,mately adopted as the wide-area digital radio,25
NA,"standard, it will be necessary for receiver",25
NA,manufacturers to produce multiformat de-,25
NA,vices that are able to receive both DAB and,25
NA,"DRM, as well as AM and FM analog radio.",25
NA,"But as the ABC notes, in the absence of a",25
NA,second digital radio standard for regional,25
NA,"areas, there are no incentives for manufac-",25
NA,turers to consider the need to develop multi-,25
NA,format receivers in their forward program-,25
NA,ming.,25
NA,"What is the result of that? It could be that,",25
NA,by the time a second digital radio standard is,25
NA,"settled that can extend to the regions, digital",25
NA,tuners that are only able to receive DAB will,25
NA,be available for purchase. Where does that,25
NA,"leave the people in the regions? Clearly, a",25
NA,better outcome all round would be for all,25
NA,digital tuners that are sold in Australia to be,25
NA,capable of receiving both standards. But this,25
NA,"legislation will not provide that direction,",25
NA,guidance and incentive. That is why we say,25
NA,this should be deferred.,25
NA,We are not trying to be prescriptive about,25
NA,the technologies the government should,25
NA,"commit to, given that trials as to the best",25
NA,technology are being carried out; we are say-,25
NA,ing: ‘Let's get it right. Let's take the advice,25
NA,and let's consider all the information that is,25
NA,available to us.' But the government has to,25
NA,ensure that regional Australia does not miss,25
NA,out on this technology. Our fear is that rush-,25
NA,ing in haste to introduce this legislation will,25
NA,see them missing out. Why is the govern-,25
NA,ment rushing it? Why shouldn't it be prop-,25
NA,erly considering the submissions that are,25
NA,being made? There has not been enough con-,25
NA,"sultation, not only in relation to the impact",25
NA,on rural and regional Australia. The report of,25
NA,the Senate Standing Committee on Environ-,25
NA,"ment, Communications, Information Tech-",25
NA,nology and the Arts identifies a number of,25
NA,"other problem areas, and there has not been",25
NA,sufficient time for those making the submis-,25
NA,sions to consider the department's response,25
NA,to them because the department's response to,25
NA,their concerns only came in last week. There,25
NA,were some 137 responses from the depart-,25
NA,"ment, yet there has not been sufficient time",25
NA,to consider them at all.,25
NA,We believe that all of Australia deserves,25
NA,the best available standards. We believe this,25
NA,bill is letting down regional Australia again.,25
NA,I do not know where the National Party,25
NA,"stands these days, but if it is not standing up",25
NA,for regional Australia who does it represent?,25
NA,Why are they supporting the undue haste of,25
NA,"this legislation? I say to the National Party,",25
NA,to the members who represent rural and re-,25
NA,gional Australians: support Labor's amend-,25
NA,ment because we are looking after their in-,25
NA,terests and ensuring that the reach is avail-,25
NA,able to them. We want digital but we want it,25
NA,"for all Australians, not just for the capital",25
NA,"cities, and our amendment, our deferral, will",25
NA,ensure that we get it right. (Time expired),25
Mr FARMER ,Macarthur-,25
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,25
NA,"Education, Science and Training) (9.31",25
NA,"am)-You will find, during what I have to",25
NA,"say in summing up this debate, that we have",26
NA,addressed a number of the concerns high-,26
NA,lighted by the opposition. The Broadcasting,26
NA,Legislation Amendment (Digital Radio) Bill,26
NA,2007 and the Radio Licence Fees Amend-,26
NA,ment Bill 2007 provide the Australian radio,26
NA,industry with a unique and important oppor-,26
NA,tunity to commence digital radio services.,26
NA,"Digitisation is a key strategic issue for radio,",26
NA,which is the last significant broadcasting,26
NA,platform to remain analog only. The Austra-,26
NA,lian radio industry has lobbied strongly for,26
NA,the introduction of digital radio to enable it,26
NA,to respond to the opportunities and chal-,26
NA,lenges that digital broadcasting presents.,26
NA,There is no doubt that digital radio has the,26
NA,potential to enhance the already high-quality,26
NA,radio services enjoyed by Australian radio,26
NA,listeners every day.,26
NA,The opposition would have us delay the,26
NA,"introduction of the new technology, and",26
NA,thereby deny the radio-listening public the,26
NA,opportunity of new and innovative digital,26
NA,"radio services, until further consultation has",26
NA,occurred; yet a comprehensive process of,26
NA,consultation has already occurred in the de-,26
NA,velopment of this legislation with the full,26
NA,support and involvement of the Australian,26
NA,"radio industry. In December 2004, the gov-",26
NA,ernment initiated an intensive process of in-,26
NA,"dustry consultation, research and policy de-",26
NA,velopment to examine the most appropriate,26
NA,technology and framework for the introduc-,26
NA,tion of digital radio in Australia. This proc-,26
NA,ess culminated in the release by the Minister,26
NA,"for Communications, Information Technol-",26
NA,ogy and the Arts in October 2005 of a policy,26
NA,framework to guide the implementation of,26
NA,"digital radio, which is now being imple-",26
NA,mented through this legislation. The gov-,26
NA,ernment's policy development process had,26
NA,the strong support and involvement of indus-,26
NA,"try, and the framework was warmly received",26
NA,by major stakeholder groups when it was,26
NA,announced. The stakeholders have been fur-,26
NA,ther involved in the development of legisla-,26
NA,tion to implement the framework through the,26
NA,release of an exposure draft of the bills prior,26
NA,to their introduction into parliament and,26
NA,through the inquiry of the Senate Standing,26
NA,"Committee on Environment, Communica-",26
NA,"tions, Information Technology and the Arts.",26
NA,Underpinned by this exhaustive policy,26
NA,"development process, these bills provide a",26
NA,measured approach to the introduction of,26
NA,"digital radio in this country, one that bal-",26
NA,ances a range of complex objectives and,26
NA,constraints. Two of these are the scarcity of,26
NA,available spectrum for digital radio and the,26
NA,choice of digital radio technology. While,26
NA,there are a range of technology standards,26
NA,"available for digital radio, it will be crucial",26
NA,that Australia adopt a standard that is widely,26
NA,deployed and for which there are a range of,26
NA,reasonably priced consumer receivers avail-,26
NA,"able. Equally importantly, this standard must",26
NA,be compatible with the radio frequency spec-,26
NA,trum available for digital radio broadcasting,26
NA,in Australia. The bill provides for the intro-,26
NA,duction of services using the digital audio,26
NA,"broadcasting, or DAB, standard. DAB is the",26
NA,most mature and developed of the terrestrial,26
NA,"digital radio platforms, and its adoption in",26
NA,Australia has the full support of industry.,26
NA,These DAB based digital radio services,26
NA,"will be introduced in a progressive manner,",26
NA,with the first services to commence in the,26
NA,state capital cities by 1 January 2009. This,26
NA,progressive approach to service introduction,26
NA,"reflects the view, supported by the interna-",26
NA,"tional experience with this technology, that",26
NA,digital radio will supplement existing analog,26
NA,radio services for a considerable period and,26
NA,may never be a complete replacement. Con-,26
NA,"trary to the suggestions of the opposition,",26
NA,listeners outside the state capitals have not,26
NA,been overlooked. The legislation provides,26
NA,that regional markets will have an opportu-,26
NA,nity to commence DAB digital radio services,26
NA,dependent on the interest of relevant broad-,26
NA,casters in providing services. The commer-,27
NA,cial radio industry has publicly expressed,27
NA,considerable interest in providing DAB ser-,27
NA,"vices in a number of large regional markets,",27
NA,and it is therefore reasonable to expect that,27
NA,digital radio services may commence in a,27
NA,number of these areas some time after 2009.,27
NA,While DAB is the clear choice for the im-,27
NA,plementation of digital radio in Australia's,27
NA,"larger markets, it is acknowledged that the",27
NA,platform may be unable to replicate the ex-,27
NA,tensive broadcast coverage of services in,27
NA,"many of the regional markets, particularly",27
NA,AM services. Consideration will need to be,27
NA,given to whether the other technologies such,27
NA,"as digital radio mondiale, or DRM, are better",27
NA,placed to address the audience needs of some,27
NA,of the regional areas.,27
NA,While DRM has particular strengths in,27
NA,terms of its capacity to provide a very wide,27
NA,"coverage service, it remains an underdevel-",27
NA,"oped technology, with affordable consumer",27
NA,sets only recently being produced in any,27
NA,meaningful numbers. There would be risks if,27
NA,Australia were to draft legislation to support,27
NA,the introduction of technology that is yet to,27
NA,achieve significant commercial support in,27
NA,"overseas markets. This consideration, to-",27
NA,gether with the view of digital radio as a,27
NA,"supplementary technology, supports the con-",27
NA,clusion that it would be premature for Aus-,27
NA,tralia to develop a detailed regulatory,27
NA,framework for alternative digital radio tech-,27
NA,nologies at this time.,27
NA,"However, there would be a clear benefit in",27
NA,continuing the assessment of technology op-,27
NA,tions for regional digital radio. This is conbeen,27
NA,sistent with the government's stated com-,27
NA,mitment to ensuring equitable access to the,27
NA,new services in broadcasting for people liv-,27
NA,"ing in rural, regional and remote Australia.",27
NA,"To this end, the legislation provides for a",27
NA,statutory review by 1 January 2011 of tech-,27
NA,nologies for the transmission of digital radio,27
NA,broadcasting services and restricted datacast-,27
NA,ing services in regional licence areas. This,27
NA,review will allow for the appropriate consid-,27
NA,eration of issues such as the availability of,27
NA,"equipment for, and the coverage characteris-",27
NA,"tics of, various digital radio technologies, as",27
NA,well as the types of services that could result,27
NA,from the use of those technologies in re-,27
NA,"gional areas, and will thus allow for adjust-",27
NA,ments to the regulatory framework if neces-,27
NA,sary.,27
NA,During the first phase of the introduction,27
NA,"of DAB digital radio, it will be important to",27
NA,provide the commercial radio industry with,27
NA,an appropriate measure of stability and cer-,27
NA,tainty as they roll out services. The legisla-,27
NA,tion provides this with a six-year moratorium,27
NA,on the issue of new licence area planned,27
NA,commercial digital radio licences from the,27
NA,commencement of services in the respective,27
NA,markets.,27
NA,"However, the legislation also seeks to bal-",27
NA,ance the stability provided to incumbent,27
NA,broadcasters with the requirement that they,27
NA,fully utilise the new platform. Each incum-,27
NA,bent commercial radio broadcasting licensee,27
NA,will be obligated to commence a digital radio,27
NA,service and to continue to provide such a,27
NA,service for the duration of the moratorium.,27
NA,Failure by any licensee to meet this require-,27
NA,ment will result in the licensee forfeiting,27
NA,their rights in digital and will require the,27
NA,regulator to issue a new digital commercial,27
NA,radio licence for the area concerned. This is,27
NA,an important obligation on the commercial,27
NA,broadcasters-a point that seems to have,27
NA,missed by the opposition. It will ensure,27
NA,that the digital radio platform is fully utilised,27
NA,and allow appropriate commercial entry,27
NA,where an incumbent commercial broadcaster,27
NA,chooses not to provide a digital radio service.,27
NA,"In terms of transmitter licensing, the legis-",27
NA,lation provides incumbent broadcasters with,27
NA,the opportunity to own and operate the rele-,27
NA,"vant licences, known as multiplex transmitter",28
NA,"licences, that will provide their digital radio",28
NA,services. This is consistent with arrange-,28
NA,ments for analog radio and digital television,28
NA,where broadcasters manage the transmission,28
NA,of their services and control the associated,28
NA,spectrum.,28
NA,The community broadcaster's involve-,28
NA,ment in multiplex licensing and operations,28
NA,will be by way of a representative company,28
NA,formed and owned by community licensees,28
NA,in each market. This representative company,28
NA,will enable the relevant community broad-,28
NA,casters in a licence area to manage their col-,28
NA,lective involvement in digital radio-as pro-,28
NA,vided for in the government's announced,28
NA,policy framework-on an equitable and,28
NA,transparent basis. The government's policy,28
NA,framework also provides the community sec-,28
NA,tor with guaranteed access to capacity on the,28
NA,multiplex transmitter licences that will also,28
NA,provide the guaranteed access for digital ra-,28
NA,dio services of the commercial broadcasters.,28
NA,The legislation establishes a multiplex ac-,28
NA,"cess regime to ensure efficient, open and",28
NA,generally non-discriminatory access to digi-,28
NA,"tal radio multiplexes and, in particular, rights",28
NA,for incumbent broadcasters to access multi-,28
NA,plex capacity. In the case of the wide-,28
NA,coverage community radio broadcasting li-,28
NA,"censees, the legislation reserves two-ninths",28
NA,of the capacity of every foundation multiplex,28
NA,transmitter licence for the community broad-,28
NA,casters in a market to collectively use for,28
NA,digital radio. This provides the sector with an,28
NA,opportunity to participate in digital radio,28
NA,from the commencement of the first services.,28
NA,I would also like to note that the government,28
NA,has backed up this commitment to the com-,28
NA,munity sector with federal budget funding of,28
NA,over $10 million to help community broad-,28
NA,casters establish digital radio infrastructure.,28
NA,The government has also committed to,28
NA,funding the roll-out of infrastructure to sup-,28
NA,port the delivery of digital radio services by,28
NA,the national broadcasters-the ABC and the,28
NA,"SBS. Together, these initiatives will enable",28
NA,the sectors to participate with the commer-,28
NA,cial broadcasters in the commencement of,28
NA,digital radio services in the state capital cities,28
NA,on 1 January 2009. This is an excellent out-,28
NA,come for the introduction of digital radio in,28
NA,Australia and will support the successful es-,28
NA,tablishment of the new platform. The imple-,28
NA,mentation of digital radio overseas has high-,28
NA,lighted that consumer take-up depends on the,28
NA,capacity for digital radio to offer more in,28
NA,terms of choice and quality of radio services.,28
NA,"In Australia, the national broadcasters play",28
NA,a vital role in the Australian radio market and,28
NA,"are a critical source of service diversity, with",28
NA,their services highly valued by audiences,28
NA,"across the country. Similarly, community",28
NA,radio is an established player in the radio,28
NA,"broadcasting landscape, making a valuable",28
NA,contribution to the diversity of radio ser-,28
NA,vices. This funding package will ensure that,28
NA,the roles of the respective sectors are carried,28
NA,forward in the digital environment.,28
NA,"In terms of digital radio services, the leg-",28
NA,islation permits each of these sectors to pro-,28
NA,vide any combination of text or still visual,28
NA,images as part of digital radio content or,28
NA,content in a form determined by the minister.,28
NA,This mechanism will allow careful consid-,28
NA,eration of any additional types of radio con-,28
NA,"tent, such as animation of moving image ma-",28
NA,"terial, in the context of the broadcaster regu-",28
NA,latory framework for broadcasting services,28
NA,and the experience of digital radio in Austra-,28
NA,lia and internationally.,28
NA,"In addition, the legislation permits broad-",28
NA,casters to provide multiple digital radio ser-,28
NA,vices rather than a single stream of radio,28
NA,"content, and there will be no requirement for",28
NA,broadcasters to simulcast their existing ana-,28
NA,log services in digital-although some,28
NA,broadcasters may choose to do so. These,28
NA,measures harness the potential of the DAB,29
NA,standard to expand the range of radio ser-,29
NA,"vices in a spectrum-efficient manner, ena-",29
NA,bling broadcasters to provide a wide range of,29
NA,programming that is responsive to audience,29
NA,needs.,29
NA,"As the member for Moreton indicated, this",29
NA,is enabling legislation. It provides a frame-,29
NA,work for the industry to take forward and,29
NA,"make good use of. Taken as a whole, the",29
NA,measures contained in this legislation cement,29
NA,radio's important position in Australia's me-,29
NA,"dia landscape, providing industry with the",29
NA,opportunity to invest in innovative new digi-,29
NA,tal content and provide listeners with a rich,29
NA,and more diverse radio offering.,29

Mr BOWEN ,Prospect) (9.50 am)-The,29
NA,Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No.,29
NA,2) Bill 2007 is an omnibus bill which the,29
NA,opposition will support. I will be moving a,29
NA,second reading amendment in relation to the,29
NA,venture capital provisions when I turn to,29
NA,them later in the proceedings. Schedule 1 of,29
NA,the bill deals with the effective life provi-,29
NA,sions of mining rights. The amendments in-,29
NA,cluded in this bill clarify the law so that it,29
NA,reflects the original policy intent. The,29
NA,changes mean that a taxpayer acquiring a,29
NA,mining right from a prior holder will be able,29
NA,"to estimate the remaining life, rather than the",29
NA,"whole life, of the existing or proposed mine",29
NA,"to which the right relates, as with other as-",29
NA,sets. The amendments provide that taxpayers,29
NA,can work out the effective life of their min-,29
NA,ing right themselves by estimating the period,29
NA,"until the end of the life of the mine, quarry or",29
NA,petroleum field. Taxpayers holding mining,29
NA,rights will have the choice of using either the,29
NA,prime cost or the diminishing value method,29
NA,"in calculating the decline in value, as with",29
NA,other assets. Once the life of the mine has,29
NA,been estimated there will be no requirement,29
NA,for a yearly or periodic restoration of the,29
NA,"effective life of the mining right. However, a",30
NA,taxpayer can reassess the effective life if,30
NA,original estimate is no longer accurate.,30
NA,These amendments apply from 1 July,30
NA,2001. This is retrospective because the 2003,30
NA,amendments were also retrospective to 1,30
NA,July 2001. This will ensure that the policy,30
NA,intent is reflected in the law since the introforward,30
NA,duction of division 40 into the 1997 act. La-,30
NA,bor supports this move to clarify the law and,30
NA,provide certainty to taxpayers. I do note that,30
NA,it has been some time in coming. This is a,30
NA,regular refrain from me because it is a com-,30
NA,mon problem. The government are very slow,30
NA,to correct drafting anomalies that are pointed,30
NA,"out to them. I note, in passing, that last",30
NA,night's budget included a cut in the number,30
NA,of staff for Treasury. I certainly hope that,30
NA,will not be the staff who are involved in,30
NA,"drafting tax laws amendment bills, because I",30
NA,"believe that, if anything, that area needs",30
NA,"more resources, not fewer.",30
NA,Schedule 2 of the bill proposes to allow,30
NA,deductions for boating expenses to taxpayers,30
NA,who do not use their boat for specific busi-,30
NA,ness activities. The current income tax law,30
NA,allows only people who are carrying on a,30
NA,business with their boat to claim deductions.,30
NA,The tax law denies deductions for taxpayers,30
NA,who use or hold their boats to earn ‘passive',30
NA,"income. For example, a boat owner who oc-",30
NA,casionally rents out their boat for income is,30
NA,assessed on that income but is not able to,30
NA,claim any deductions. As the opposition,30
NA,"agree that this is unfair, we support this",30
NA,"measure. It is a fundamental principle, in my",30
NA,"view, that if you are assessed on income you",30
NA,should be able to claim deductions relating to,30
NA,generating that income. The amendments,30
NA,will allow deductions for expenses relating,30
NA,to earning income from boats even where the,30
NA,owners are not carrying on a specified type,30
NA,of business.,30
NA,The proposed changes will allow taxpay-,30
NA,the ers who cannot demonstrate that they are,30
NA,carrying on a business using a boat to deduct,30
NA,expenditure relating to their boating activity,30
NA,up to the level of income they generate in,30
NA,that year from the boating activity. They will,30
NA,also allow excess deductions to be carried,30
NA,and deducted against future boating,30
NA,income activities. A taxpayer will be able to,30
NA,deduct the expenses to acquire a boat; retain,30
NA,ownership; acquire rights to use a boat; re-,30
NA,"tain the rights to use a boat; use, operate,",30
NA,maintain or repair a boat in relation to any,30
NA,obligation associated with that boat or any,30
NA,obligation associated with the taxpayer's,30
NA,right to use that boat.,30
NA,Expenditure in relation to a fringe benefit,30
NA,will be exempt from the quarantining rule so,30
NA,that expenditure by an employer in providing,30
NA,a boat as a fringe benefit as part of a salary,30
NA,package is deductible to the employer re-,30
NA,gardless of the employee's boating income.,30
NA,This is consistent with the general treatment,30
NA,under income tax law of expenses in relation,30
NA,to fringe benefits. Labor supports this meas-,30
NA,ure. The amendments should ensure that tax-,30
NA,payers who generate an income stream using,30
NA,their boat are not treated unfairly compared,30
NA,to other taxpayers.,30
NA,Schedule 3 of the bill proposes amend-,30
NA,ments to the tax law relating to research and,30
NA,development tax concessions. It makes 10,30
NA,"technical amendments to clarify the law, re-",30
NA,move unintended consequences and ensure,30
NA,the law accurately reflects the original policy,30
NA,intent of the R&D provisions. The amend-,30
NA,ments proposed by this schedule include,30
NA,provisions so that companies will be able to,30
NA,object to the amount of R&D tax offset al-,30
NA,lowed by the tax commissioner if they are,30
NA,dissatisfied with the amount allowed. Cur-,30
NA,rently companies can only object to an as-,30
NA,sessment when they owe money to the tax,30
NA,office. The bill will also allow companies,30
NA,who do not choose the R&D offset to amend,30
NA,their tax return to claim it by writing to the,31
NA,commissioner. Currently a company must,31
NA,choose the R&D offset instead of the deduc-,31
NA,tion in the company's tax return for the year.,31
NA,"Once it chooses the offset, it cannot claim",31
NA,the deduction for that year. For the acceler-,31
NA,"ated deduction, expenses incurred in having",31
NA,an outside body perform R&D activities for,31
NA,the company are deductible at the acceler-,31
NA,"ated rate. The $20,000 minimum spend",31
NA,threshold does not apply. This bill extends,31
NA,this to companies wishing to claim the R&D,31
NA,tax offset for the amount of the contracted,31
NA,expenditure.,31
NA,The R&D tax offset provisions may not,31
NA,cover all companies in a group as it refers to,31
NA,"‘taxpayers', which is too narrow to cover",31
NA,certain companies that the original policy,31
NA,intended to cover. References to ‘taxpayers',31
NA,will be replaced by references to ‘persons' to,31
NA,cover all companies in a group. This is im-,31
NA,"portant because, to reach the R&D expendi-",31
NA,"ture threshold of $20,000, eligibility applies",31
NA,to all R&D expenditure in a group of com-,31
NA,"panies. Further, currently a group of compa-",31
NA,nies may be eligible for an amount of the,31
NA,premium deduction without any firm in the,31
NA,group being eligible for the allocation of that,31
NA,amount. This situation arises where a group,31
NA,of companies have collective R&D expendi-,31
NA,ture greater than the rolling three-year aver-,31
NA,age of the group and are therefore entitled to,31
NA,the deduction but no individual company has,31
NA,increased their R&D expenditure over the,31
NA,previous year's expenditure. This is because,31
NA,the premium deduction is only available for a,31
NA,member of a corporate group that must have,31
NA,increased its R&D expenditure above its,31
NA,"three-year average. Also, at least one mem-",31
NA,ber in that group must have increased its,31
NA,R&D expenditure over the immediate previ-,31
NA,ous year. This was an anomaly in the legisla-,31
NA,tion. We welcome its correction.,31
NA,The bill will eliminate the criterion that,31
NA,R&D group have at least one member of the,31
NA,group whose expenditure for the year is,31
NA,greater than its R&D expenditure in the prior,31
NA,income year to access the premium so that,31
NA,the R&D group will only have to have in-,31
NA,creased its R&D expenditure above the aver-,31
NA,age for the past three years to be eligible for,31
NA,the premium deduction. Currently an entire,31
NA,group of companies becomes automatically,31
NA,eligible for the premium deduction if a newly,31
NA,acquired company can establish eligibility,31
NA,due to expenditure incurred prior to joining,31
NA,the group. This bill will restrict eligibility to,31
NA,expenditure that is incurred during the com-,31
NA,pany's membership of the group so that a,31
NA,group will not be eligible for the premium,31
NA,concession based on expenditure incurred by,31
NA,a company when it was not a member of the,31
NA,group.,31
NA,As a result of the method for calculating,31
NA,"the 175 per cent premium concession, it is",31
NA,possible that the premium concession will be,31
NA,negative in certain circumstances. As this,31
NA,concession should only provide a benefit to,31
NA,"companies, the calculation will be taken to",31
NA,be zero. We welcome these technical and,31
NA,detailed amendments to the R&D tax con-,31
NA,"cessions. However, I make the point that it is",31
NA,time for more than technical amendments. It,31
NA,is time for root and branch amendments to,31
NA,the R&D tax concessions. It is time that this,31
NA,government re-examined its very short-,31
NA,sighted decision to slash R&D tax conces-,31
NA,sions when it came to office in 1996.,31
NA,Since that decision we have seen the aver-,31
NA,age annual growth rate of real business in-,31
NA,vestment in R&D plummet from 11.4 per,31
NA,cent in the period from 1986-87 to 1995-96,31
NA,to 5.1 per cent in a similar period 10 years,31
NA,later. For manufacturing the story is even,31
NA,"worse, with the average annual growth rate",31
NA,slipping from 10.6 per cent to only 1.9 per,31
NA,cent. At 1.76 per cent-already half a per-,31
NA,centage point below the OECD average-,31
NA,an Australia's overall R&D effort is set to be,31
NA,overtaken by China's in the next few years,31
NA,unless urgent action is taken. Following the,32
NA,"government's 1996 changes, R&D as a share",32
NA,of output plummeted from about 3.3 per cent,32
NA,to only about 2.8 per cent. We can only,32
NA,speculate about what would be different to-,32
NA,day if the government had not taken its,32
NA,shortsighted decision back in 1996. We can,32
NA,only speculate as to what our R&D rates,32
NA,would be. We can only speculate as to,32
NA,whether we would have had over 50 con-,32
NA,secutive trade deficits. We can only speculate,32
NA,as to whether last night's budget would have,32
NA,still predicted that the current account deficit measures.,32
NA,would blow out to six per cent of GDP-as it,32
NA,did-one of the highest figures encountered,32
NA,in Australia's history. We have 10 years of,32
NA,"wasted R&D opportunities, 10 years of fail-",32
NA,ure to invest in the future. It is time for more,32
NA,than technical amendments; it is time for a,32
NA,complete re-examination of this govern-,32
NA,ment's approach.,32
NA,Schedule 4 of the bill amends the tax law,32
NA,to allow for a deduction for donations of,32
NA,small parcels of shares in listed public com-,32
NA,panies to deductible gift recipients. The,32
NA,amendments will allow taxpayers a tax de-,32
NA,duction where they make a gift to a DGR of,32
NA,shares in a listed public company where,32
NA,those shares were acquired more than 12,32
NA,months before making the gift and are valued,32
NA,"at less than $5,000. This is eminently sensi-",32
NA,ble and it meets with our support.,32
NA,The bill also amends the Income Tax As-,32
NA,sessment Act 1997 to update the list of de-,32
NA,ductible gift recipients. Schedule 5 adds the,32
NA,American Australian Association Ltd and the,32
NA,Bunbury Diocese Cathedral Rebuilding Fund,32
NA,"to the list of specifically listed DGRs, and we",32
NA,welcome this. The American Australian As-,32
NA,sociation do good work-and have done for,32
NA,many years-promoting good relations be-,32
NA,tween our two great countries. They played,32
NA,an important role in having the American,32
NA,memorial erected here in Canberra and they,32
NA,continue to play an important role in the an-,32
NA,nual commemorations of the Battle of the,32
NA,"Coral Sea, as well as doing much other good",32
NA,work. Tax deductibility for donations to this,32
NA,"group is eminently sensible and supportable,",32
NA,as are those for the cathedral rebuilding fund.,32
NA,Schedule 5 also extends the DGR listing un-,32
NA,til 27 August 2007 of the Finding Sydney,32
NA,Foundation-which of course does good,32
NA,work in trying to find that battleship and,32
NA,those who went down on her-and reflects,32
NA,the name change of a specifically listed,32
NA,"DGR. Again, Labor supports each of these",32
NA,Schedule 6 extends eligibility for tax de-,32
NA,ductions for contributions to DGRs where,32
NA,there is a minor benefit in return for their,32
NA,"donation. In other words, where a fundrais-",32
NA,"ing function is held-a dinner, a ball or some",32
NA,other sort of function-and there is a minor,32
NA,"benefit received in return, such as the dinner",32
NA,on the night or some other form of minor,32
NA,benefit for attending the function. Schedule 6,32
NA,proposes to relax the eligibility thresholds,32
NA,for minor benefits to allow deductions for,32
NA,contributions of more than $150-it is cur-,32
NA,rently $250-where the market value of the,32
NA,minor benefit is no more than that. We sup-,32
NA,port this. Fundraising functions and dinners,32
NA,are very important parts of a charity's fund-,32
NA,raising activities. Just a couple of weeks ago,32
NA,I was delighted to host the Learning Links,32
NA,"charity ball in Bossley Park, which raised",32
NA,"almost $50,000 for Learning Links. I am sure",32
NA,that Learning Links and other charities ap-,32
NA,"preciate this amendment, and, of course, we",32
NA,will be supporting it.,32
NA,Schedule 7 corrects a defect in the defini-,32
NA,tion of ‘exempt entity' by ensuring the defi-,32
NA,nition covers all entities exempt from tax,32
NA,under the tax law. This bill will change the,32
NA,definition of ‘exempt entity' in the Income,32
NA,Tax Assessment Act to include any entity if,32
NA,all of its income is exempted by any Com-,32
NA,monwealth legislation or if it is an untaxable,32
NA,Commonwealth entity. This will ensure that,32
NA,ancillary funds and prescribed private funds,33
NA,"can donate to tax exempt state, territory and",33
NA,Commonwealth bodies such as public ambu-,33
NA,"lance services, research authorities and cul-",33
NA,tural institutions. This was the original intent,33
NA,"of TLAB (No. 3) of 2005, which made",33
NA,changes to public ancillary funds and pre-,33
NA,scribed private funds. I note that various in-,33
NA,"stitutions, including the Opera House, made",33
NA,submissions to the Senate inquiry welcoming,33
NA,"this, and of course we join them in that.",33
NA,I now turn to the venture,33
NA,the bill. A healthy venture capital sector is,33
NA,vital to the strength of the Australian econ-,33
NA,omy. Venture capitalists take risks-they,33
NA,invest in things which may or may not pro-,33
NA,duce them a return-and the tax system rec-,33
NA,ognises this. The OECD notes in its Eco-,33
NA,nomic policy reforms: going for growth paper,33
NA,of last year that Australia's venture capital,33
NA,"investment rate, as a percentage of GDP, is",33
NA,below the OECD average and is very signifi-,33
NA,cantly below the rates for the United King-,33
NA,"dom, Canada and the United States. The",33
NA,government enacted the Venture Capital Bill,33
NA,2002 and the Taxation Laws Amendment,33
NA,(Venture Capital) Bill 2002 to improve the,33
NA,tax treatment of venture capital. This has had,33
NA,a questionable impact. Only 15 VCLPs and,33
NA,15 PDFs have been registered since that,33
NA,time.,33
NA,The government then appointed the Wat-,33
NA,son review to look at the treatment of ven-,33
NA,ture capital in our taxation system. The gov-,33
NA,ernment says that this bill adopts the recom-,33
NA,mendations and meets the concerns of the,33
NA,"Watson review, which it received in Decem-",33
NA,ber 2005. I say: ‘That's great. I would rather,33
NA,come to that conclusion myself; I would,33
NA,rather make that decision for myself.' It,33
NA,would be helpful if I and other members,33
NA,could read the Watson review. It would be,33
NA,helpful if the government would actually,33
NA,release the review that they commissioned.,33
NA,When the Assistant Treasurer comes into the,33
NA,House to sum up this debate I ask him to,33
NA,"enlighten the House as to why he, the indus-",33
NA,try minister and presumably other cabinet,33
NA,ministers are the only people in Australia,33
NA,entitled to read the Watson review. Why has,33
NA,that privilege not been extended to members,33
NA,of the opposition or to any other person in,33
NA,this country so that Australia can make the,33
NA,decision and individuals can make the,33
NA,judgement about whether this government is,33
NA,adopting all the recommendations of the,33
NA,capital section of Watson review?,33
NA,I suspect the government are reluctant to,33
NA,release the Watson review because it shows,33
NA,that their previous reforms have been less,33
NA,than successful. When a government com-,33
NA,missions a report that finds that something,33
NA,"they have done has been less than successful,",33
NA,"they actually get points for fessing up, being",33
NA,honest about it and releasing the report. They,33
NA,get zero points for keeping it hidden and for,33
NA,refusing to release it. And they certainly get,33
NA,zero points for bringing in legislation which,33
NA,is meant to comply with the recommenda-,33
NA,tions of the report and not giving the parlia-,33
NA,ment of this nation the chance to read the,33
NA,report to make that assessment for itself. So,33
NA,the Assistant Treasurer today has an oppor-,33
NA,tunity to explain to the House why that re-,33
NA,"port has not been released. Indeed, he has an",33
NA,opportunity today to release it so that this,33
NA,House can make that judgement.,33
NA,I also note that last night the budget an-,33
NA,nounced further changes to venture capital,33
NA,provisions. These changes were announced,33
NA,in last year's budget. The day after this,33
NA,"budget, we are finally debating them. In the",33
NA,"meantime, more have been announced. This",33
NA,reinforces the point that the government is,33
NA,very good at making announcements on,33
NA,budget night but is very poor in implement-,33
NA,ing them.,33
NA,I think there are 10 separate measures that,33
NA,"were announced in the 2006 budget which,",33
NA,"the day after the 2007 budget, we are still to",34
NA,see introduced into this House. I hope for the,34
NA,sake of the Australian economy that some of,34
NA,the measures announced last night are intro-,34
NA,duced into this House a good deal quicker,34
NA,"than that. For instance, I hope that the",34
NA,change to the $100 million cap-which my,34
NA,"predecessor, the previous shadow Assistant",34
NA,"Treasurer, moved an amendment in the Sen-",34
NA,"ate to achieve two years ago, and which the",34
NA,government finally announced last night-is,34
NA,introduced a good deal more quickly than 12,34
NA,months down the track. My point is: what,34
NA,confidence do we have that these measures,34
NA,will achieve the government's objectives,34
NA,"when, before they were even introduced into",34
NA,"the House of Representatives, further meas-",34
NA,ures were announced last night?,34
NA,Schedule 8 amends the venture capital,34
NA,provisions to relax the eligibility require-,34
NA,ments for the concessional treatment of for-,34
NA,eign residents investing in venture capital,34
NA,limited partnerships or VCLPs. It also intro-,34
NA,duces a new investment vehicle-the ‘early,34
NA,stage venture capital limited partnership' or,34
NA,ESVCLP. The aim of the tax concessions is,34
NA,to provide equity capital for a relatively,34
NA,high-risk and expanding business that finds,34
NA,difficult to attract investment through normal,34
NA,commercial mechanisms.,34
NA,Schedule 8 relaxes the restrictions on,34
NA,VCLPs. It does that in the following ways. It,34
NA,removes restrictions on the investor's coun-,34
NA,try of residence. People in this sector have,34
NA,been calling for this for some time and we,34
NA,welcome it. It allows the VCLPs to invest in,34
NA,"unit trusts and convertible notes, whereas",34
NA,currently investments must be in the form of,34
NA,shares or options in companies. It reduces,34
NA,the minimum partnership capital required for,34
NA,registration from $20 million to $10 million.,34
NA,And it allows the appointment of auditors to,34
NA,be delayed until the end of the financial,34
NA,of the investment; currently an auditor is,34
NA,required on an ongoing basis.,34
NA,Schedule 8 also relaxes the ‘Australian,34
NA,"nexus' test, which currently requires that the",34
NA,investee entity-the company the VCLP in-,34
NA,vests in-be a company resident of Australia,34
NA,and that 50 per cent of the assets and em-,34
NA,ployees of the investee entity be located in,34
NA,Australia for 12 months following the in-,34
NA,vestment. The changes allow some invest-,34
NA,ments-up to 20 per cent of the committed,34
NA,capital-to be in companies and unit trusts,34
NA,that are not in Australia.,34
NA,"However, this bill maintains the restriction",34
NA,on VCLPs that target investees must have,34
NA,less than $250 million in assets-a restric-,34
NA,tion generally not imposed in other jurisdic-,34
NA,tions. I will be dealing with this in my sec-,34
NA,ond reading amendment.,34
NA,"As I indicated earlier, this bill also estab-",34
NA,lishes a new investment vehicle-the early,34
NA,stage venture capital vehicle-which will,34
NA,progressively replace the existing pooled,34
NA,"development funds or PDFs, which were",34
NA,established in that 2002 legislation and,34
NA,"which have had, at best, patchy success.",34
NA,These new vehicles will be flow-through tax,34
NA,"vehicles, like VCLPs; however, the income",34
NA,and capital gains tax earned by these vehicles,34
NA,it will be exempt from any Australian tax. This,34
NA,exemption will apply to both resident and,34
NA,non-resident investors.,34
NA,"However, the attractiveness of these con-",34
NA,cessions must be measured by the following,34
NA,restrictions that will apply to these vehicles.,34
NA,The maximum size of the fund administered,34
NA,by an ESVCLP is $100 million. They will,34
NA,not be able to invest in investee entities hav-,34
NA,ing total assets exceeding $50 million; this,34
NA,restriction already applies to PDFs. Losses,34
NA,from these new partnerships will not be de-,34
NA,ductible by the partners. And once the total,34
NA,assets of the entity invested in by an,34
NA,"ESVCLP exceed $250 million, the vehicle",34
NA,year must divest itself of that entity.,34
NA,I now move:,34
NA,That all words after “That” be omitted with a,35
NA,view to substituting the following words: “whilst,35
NA,"not declining to give the bill a second reading, the",35
NA,House condemns the Government for its failure to,35
NA,promote the venture capital industry and calls on,35
NA,the Government to:,35
NA,(1) increase to $500 million the value of assets,35
NA,of an entity invested in by an Early Stage,35
NA,Venture Capital Limited Partnership,35
NA,(ESVCLP) beyond which ESVCLP must di-,35
NA,vest itself of an interest in the entity;,35
NA,(2) increase the time allowed for a partnership to,35
NA,divest an investment from 9 months to 12,35
NA,months; and,35
NA,(3) increase the value of assets target investees,35
NA,of Venture Capital Limited Partnership can,35
NA,"have, to $500 million”.",35
NA,This amendment calls on the government to,35
NA,remove the significant requirement that,35
NA,ESVCLPs must divest themselves of an or-,35
NA,ganisation which has assets of more than,35
NA,"$250 million. As a step in that direction, it",35
NA,calls on the government to change that,35
NA,"threshold from $250 million to $500 million,",35
NA,and to increase the amount of time allowed,35
NA,for an ESVCLP to divest itself of that inter-,35
NA,est from six months-which can be extended,35
NA,by three months-to a flat 12 months.,35
NA,Increasing the threshold to $500 million,35
NA,would encourage more investment in early,35
NA,stage venture capital vehicles and more in-,35
NA,vestment in innovative businesses in Austra-,35
NA,lia. This is something which has been raised,35
NA,with me consistently in my consultations,35
NA,with the venture capital industry on this bill.,35
NA,I know the Assistant Treasurer likes to talk,35
NA,about consultation but doesn't like to actu-,35
NA,"ally do much of it, whereas I have been to",35
NA,various capital cities of this nation and con-,35
NA,sulted directly with venture capitalists about,35
NA,"the implications of this bill, and this is a con-",35
NA,cern which has been raised with me directly.,35
NA,I do not imagine that it has been raised di-,35
NA,"rectly with the Assistant Treasurer, because I",35
NA,know he believes more in the rhetoric of,35
NA,consultation than in actually doing it.,35
NA,This is a step that the Labor Party is call-,35
NA,ing on the government to adopt today. I indi-,35
NA,"cate that, should we be honoured with gov-",35
NA,"ernment later in the year, this is something",35
NA,we would be reviewing in office. We would,35
NA,be examining this threshold and the amount,35
NA,of time that is given to ESVCLPs to divest,35
NA,themselves of those assets. We would be re-,35
NA,viewing those things and having a very close,35
NA,"look at them. But, as we stand today, we",35
NA,think it would be a sensible measure for the,35
NA,"government to lift this threshold, which does",35
NA,not apply in many other jurisdictions and,35
NA,which does not give these venture capital,35
NA,"partnerships long, in real terms, to divest",35
NA,"themselves of these assets. So, while I wel-",35
NA,"come these reforms generally, I remain con-",35
NA,cerned about the restrictions on the assets,35
NA,that can be held by both investment vehicles:,35
NA,VCLPs and the new early stage vehicles.,35
NA,"As I have said, the government is making",35
NA,these changes because the venture capital,35
NA,regime it introduced in 2002 is not working,35
NA,properly and has failed to boost the venture,35
NA,capital industry by an acceptable amount.,35
NA,The removal of some of the restrictions on,35
NA,VCLPs and the new vehicles are positive and,35
NA,"welcome. However, as I have said, they do",35
NA,"not go far enough. I fear that, unless the gov-",35
NA,"ernment adopts Labor's amendment today,",35
NA,"we will be back here in one, two or three",35
NA,years time amending this legislation yet,35
NA,again. Just as we are today amending the,35
NA,"2002 legislation, just as the government last",35
NA,night announced further changes-which we,35
NA,will be amending sometime in the next 12,35
NA,"months, I presume-we will be coming back",35
NA,again to amend this legislation because the,35
NA,"government, through its lack of consultation,",35
NA,has failed to take it up.,35
NA,"Generally, I support this bill. I note that",35
NA,the government of its own volition referred it,35
NA,to a Senate committee. I presume that is be-,36
NA,cause of the farce that we saw last time with,36
NA,Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No.,36
NA,"7) Bill 2007, where the government refused",36
NA,"to refer it to a Senate committee, backflipped",36
NA,and accepted Labor's referral to a Senate,36
NA,committee and then finally had to accept the,36
NA,recommendation of Labor senators to amend,36
NA,the bill. I assume that the government,36
NA,"thought, ‘We'll avoid all that rigmarole this",36
NA,time and just refer it straightaway to a Senate,36
NA,committee.' I welcome that. I do not think,36
NA,every tax laws amendment bill has to be re-,36
NA,ferred to a Senate committee-may I let the,36
NA,Assistant Treasurer know-only those which,36
NA,cause some concern. The measures in this,36
NA,bill are generally supported. I commend the,36
NA,bill and the amendment to the House.,36
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jen-,36
NA,kins)-Is the amendment seconded?,36
NA,Mr Tanner-I have much pleasure in,36
NA,seconding the amendment.,36
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (10.16 am)-,36
NA,The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures,36
NA,No. 2) Bill 2007 contains multiple changes,36
NA,to the tax act. There are seven or eight effec-,36
NA,"tive ones. Some are technical, but most of",36
NA,them deal with specific areas that the gov-,36
NA,"ernment has given attention to, either to sim-",36
NA,plify or to extend current provisions and,36
NA,concessions. They include the effective life,36
NA,"provisions, the taxation of boating activities,",36
NA,certain expenditure on research and devel-,36
NA,"opment activities, donations of listed shares",36
NA,"to deductible gift recipients, deductible gift",36
NA,"recipients, deductions of contributions re-",36
NA,"lated to fundraising events, technical",36
NA,"amendments, and provisions relating to ven-",36
NA,"ture capital, which were dealt with by the",36
NA,previous speaker. I will run through them,36
NA,"briefly, spending some time on the taxation",36
NA,of boating activities and more time on the,36
NA,donations and deductions for deductible gift,36
NA,recipients.,36
NA,The boating provisions are very sensible.,36
NA,This area has been a problem for the boating,36
NA,industry for some time. I have examined the,36
NA,changes carefully. I am concerned that there,36
NA,is a temptation for boat owners to mix busi-,36
NA,ness with pleasure. It is very difficult for the,36
NA,tax office to determine where the line be-,36
NA,tween the two should be. Under these provi-,36
NA,"sions, there are changes to deductions and",36
NA,there are two exceptions. There is a general,36
NA,rule relating to the capping of deductions for,36
NA,income earned. Amounts attributable to a,36
NA,specific type of boating business or amounts,36
NA,incurred in providing fringe benefits are not,36
NA,quarantined. The quarantined amount is,36
NA,modified for taxpayers who have boating,36
NA,"capital gains, have profits from a boating",36
NA,"business in an income year, derive exempt",36
NA,income and become exempt.,36
NA,For anybody involved in the boating in-,36
NA,"dustry, I believe that the examples in the ex-",36
NA,planatory memorandum are essential read-,36
NA,"ing, because it is only by looking at those",36
NA,specific examples that it is possible to delve,36
NA,behind the intention of the act. I want to,36
NA,compliment the tax office for providing clear,36
NA,examples in this case. These include propos-,36
NA,als for using or holding a boat and what it,36
NA,"can be used for. For instance, the advertising",36
NA,by a boat owner of his business on the side,36
NA,of the boat may or may not be deductible. It,36
NA,depends on the methods used by the boat,36
NA,owner for gaining income. If his income is,36
NA,derived solely from a business separate from,36
NA,"the boat, of course the advertising itself on",36
NA,the boat may be deductible. But if the boat,36
NA,itself is used to raise funds and not just as a,36
NA,form of advertising but as a form of earning,36
NA,"income, then of course a different arrange-",36
NA,ment applies to taxation.,36
NA,The apportionment of the deductions that,36
NA,partly relate to using or holding a boat are,36
NA,outlined in further examples. There are ex-,36
NA,ceptions to the quarantining rule and there,36
NA,are modifications to the quarantining rule,36
NA,contained in the bill before the House. Part,37
NA,of the legislation covers the way in which,37
NA,profits can be dealt with or the way in which,37
NA,profits and losses can be carried forward.,37
NA,Another section of the legislation deals with,37
NA,owners who own multiple boats. Some may,37
NA,be solely related to fishing or business; oth-,37
NA,ers may be for pleasure. The bill clearly sets,37
NA,"out the conditions that apply. Interestingly,",37
NA,the cost to revenue of these measures is ap-,37
NA,proximately $5 million or $6 million per an-,37
NA,"num, and I believe they will be greatly bene-",37
NA,ficial to the boating industry.,37
NA,There is provision in the legislation for,37
NA,expenditure on research and development,37
NA,activities. The new law is interesting and it,37
NA,provides a number of corrections. They are,37
NA,small changes to the existing concessions for,37
NA,"research and development of any type, but",37
NA,the legislation also provides some additional,37
NA,"benefits, such as the offset in the year in",37
NA,"which entitlement is made. Currently, there",37
NA,is no provision for a company to choose the,37
NA,R&D tax offset by amending their original,37
NA,tax return. That has now changed in this bill.,37
NA,Currently the R&D concession has a general,37
NA,"exemption to the $20,000 minimum spend",37
NA,rule for contracted expenditure to a regis-,37
NA,tered research agency on behalf of a com-,37
NA,pany. This exception does not apply if the,37
NA,R&D tax offset is claimed. So that is a fur-,37
NA,ther change in this current legislation.,37
NA,The main area of particular interest to,37
NA,"me-and, I believe, the public at large-is",37
NA,the encouragement that this bill offers for,37
NA,philanthropy. I think this is an area,37
NA,ernment needs to pay attention to. I know,37
NA,that there have been considerable efforts,37
NA,made by the government to have the Prime,37
NA,Minister's Community Business Partnership,37
NA,group examine in particular the way in which,37
NA,philanthropy can be encouraged. I believe it,37
NA,is an avenue that needs careful attention. I,37
NA,think it can be easily extended to schools in,37
NA,"general and to church and charity groups,",37
NA,which perform functions which are of a,37
NA,charitable nature. There should be an exten-,37
NA,sion of the provisions of deductibility for,37
NA,gifts to charitable organisations of all types; I,37
NA,do not think the range is broad enough and I,37
NA,believe the community would benefit greatly.,37
NA,"Indeed, the social welfare bill would be re-",37
NA,duced if we were to do this. I think charitable,37
NA,organisations generally are much more effec-,37
NA,tive at providing support and services to,37
NA,those in need than government mechanisms.,37
NA,This proposal does extend philanthropy. I,37
NA,believe that it needs further examination and,37
NA,that philanthropy needs to be greatly encour-,37
NA,aged.,37
NA,The context of these amendments is that,37
NA,the income tax law encourages philanthropy,37
NA,through a range of taxation measures cover-,37
NA,ing the donation to deductible recipients of,37
NA,money or property valued at $2 or more.,37
NA,"Those gifts are deductible. Currently, gifts of",37
NA,"property to DGRs, the tax deductible gift",37
NA,"recipient group, which can include shares,",37
NA,are tax deductible if the property is pur-,37
NA,chased during the 12 months before making,37
NA,the gift or is valued by the Commissioner of,37
NA,"Taxation at more than $5,000. Gifts of prop-",37
NA,"erty, including shares, acquired at least 12",37
NA,months before making the donation and val-,37
NA,"ued at $5,000 or less are currently not tax",37
NA,deductible. The new measure was announced,37
NA,in the 2006-07 budget and applies to gifts,37
NA,and contributions made in an income year,37
NA,commencing on or after royal assent. So it,37
NA,brings forward the capacity to make deduc-,37
NA,that govtions in the current income year.,37
NA,The new law provides that taxpayers gift-,37
NA,ing shares deduct the market value of the,37
NA,"shares on the day they make the gift, pro-",37
NA,vided that the shares were acquired at least,37
NA,"12 months before making the gift, have a",37
NA,"share value of $5,000 or less, were acquired",37
NA,in a listed public company and are listed for,37
NA,quotation on the official list of the Australian,37
NA,Stock Exchange. So there is the protection,37
NA,for revenue: making sure the shares are ac-,38
NA,quired in a listed public company and mak-,38
NA,ing sure a full quotation is available. The,38
NA,capital gains provisions are something that,38
NA,"sneak in here, because it is obvious that the",38
NA,tax office would not like to see somebody,38
NA,make a capital gain and then avoid their re-,38
NA,sponsibility for paying by making a donation,38
NA,"or a gift to a charitable organisation. Again,",38
NA,we have examples. I will read one briefly.,38
NA,This is example 4.2 in the explanatory,38
NA,memorandum:,38
NA,"Mark wishes to gift $3,000 of shares in Red Ltd",38
NA,"and $4,000 of shares in Blue Ltd, both",38
NA,"lic companies, to a DGR. Both of these parcels of",38
NA,shares were purchased more than 12 months ago.,38
NA,Mark signs and submits two share ownership,38
NA,transfer forms.,38
NA,"Although their combined value exceeds $5,000,",38
NA,Mark can still deduct the gifts of shares as they,38
NA,"are treated as separate gifts each valued at $5,000",38
NA,or less.,38
NA,There are a whole series of examples about,38
NA,the way in which this law may apply to gifts,38
NA,of shares. I think it is an excellent provision,38
NA,and one that needs to be promoted by chari-,38
NA,table institutions and organisations. I think,38
NA,this is a ready source of income for these,38
NA,groups that they should be seeking out. I en-,38
NA,courage donors to actively consider whether,38
NA,or not a gift of shares is an appropriate way,38
NA,in which to make their support for an organi-,38
NA,sation known and recognised. There is no,38
NA,need to cash things out. There is no need to,38
NA,go into all the problems of finding out what,38
NA,shares are worth and going through the sale,38
NA,process with its costs. A simple transfer is,38
NA,what is proposed by this legislation.,38
NA,The other interesting provision is the pro-,38
NA,vision for tax deductibility for contributions,38
NA,relating to fundraising events. This tax de-,38
NA,ductibility provision is an interesting one. I,38
NA,will read schedule 6.1:,38
NA,The deduction is available where the value of the,38
NA,contribution is more than $150 (the current,38
NA,"threshold is more than $250), and the minor bene-",38
NA,fit received in return is no more than $150 (cur-,38
NA,rently $100) and 20 per cent (currently 10 per,38
NA,"cent) of the value of the contribution, whichever",38
NA,is the less.,38
NA,"This means that, for fundraising events, all",38
NA,sorts of things can be done to support a char-,38
NA,"ity. Again, there is an example which illus-",38
NA,trates this. Example 6.1 says:,38
NA,"Anthony pays $260 to attend a charity golf day,",38
NA,hosted by a DGR. The market value of an 18-hole,38
NA,golf game is $50. As the market value of the golf,38
NA,game is less than $150 and less than 20 per cent,38
NA,"of the value of his contribution ($260), Anthony",38
NA,listed pub- can deduct $210 ($260 less $50).,38
NA,"Without the amendments to the thresholds, An-",38
NA,thony would not be entitled to a deduction as the,38
NA,"market value of the minor benefit, the golf game",38
NA,"($50), is more than 10 per cent of the value of his",38
NA,contribution ($260 × 10 per cent = $26).,38
NA,This is a great encouragement for charities of,38
NA,"all sorts, for schools, for the Scouts and",38
NA,"Guides, for people holding art shows and all",38
NA,sorts of activities. It is a wonderful way of,38
NA,encouraging people to make minor contribu-,38
NA,"tions, whether they be football jumpers or",38
NA,whatever-a host of things can be contrib-,38
NA,uted to a charity. There is even the contribu-,38
NA,"tion of attending a charity golf day, as illus-",38
NA,trated by the explanatory memorandum.,38
NA,Clearly there are advantages to the taxpayer,38
NA,"but particularly to the organisation, the DGR.",38
NA,I commend this legislation to the House. It,38
NA,covers a wide range of important issues. I,38
NA,think they are good measures.,38
Mr HAYES ,Werriwa) (10.30 am)-I,38
NA,"know we are coming back from a break, Mr",38
NA,"Deputy Speaker, and we are all refreshed, but",38
NA,this week seems to be a week of amend-,38
NA,ments. In addition to the Tax Laws Amend-,38
NA,ment (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007 that,38
NA,we have in front of us-not an uncommon,38
NA,"form of legislative amendment, when it",38
NA,comes to this government-amendments are,38
NA,to come before the House in the form of the,38
NA,Building and Construction Industry Im-,39
NA,provement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007.,39
NA,"That is set down for debate tomorrow, I",39
NA,think. We also have the mother of all,39
NA,amendments-which the Prime Minister has,39
NA,"told us for the last year would not happen,",39
NA,out of fear that it would destroy the economy,39
NA,as we now know it-the amendments pro-,39
NA,posed to Work Choices. An effort is certainly,39
NA,being made by the government to draw to a,39
NA,conclusion a number of things that have been,39
NA,hanging around for over 12 months.,39
NA,I will keep my comments brief and rele-,39
NA,vant to this tax bill. I will limit my comments,39
NA,to the issues of research and development.,39
NA,Research and development expenditure is,39
NA,critical for the performance and advancement,39
NA,of the economy. Certainly it is critical to im-,39
NA,proving the competitiveness of industry.,39
NA,Business investment in research and devel-,39
NA,"opment, however, is at 0.95 per cent of GDP.",39
NA,That is well below the average OECD con-,39
NA,"tribution to R&D, which is 1.53 per cent. As",39
NA,"a consequence, that has this country sitting",39
NA,behind 14 other OECD nations. That is de-,39
NA,spite the fact that considerable advancements,39
NA,were made throughout the mid-1980s and the,39
NA,1990s in industry contributions to research,39
NA,and development.,39
NA,There must be many reasons for that per-,39
NA,"formance, but the fact remains that business",39
NA,spending on research and development under,39
NA,the Howard government has grown at less,39
NA,than half the rate that it grew at under the,39
NA,former Labor government. When the Prime,39
NA,Minister announced in 1996 his commitment,39
NA,"to industry, he put it in these words:",39
NA,... to improve Australia's international ranking,39
NA,"terms of expenditure on business R&D, as a share",39
NA,of GDP.,39
NA,"I have just cited the current figures, and the",39
NA,position could not be more different from,39
NA,that envisaged by the Prime Minister in,39
NA,1996. It certainly has not lived up to the,39
NA,standard set by the former Labor government,39
NA,with regard to encouraging industries to in-,39
NA,vest in research and development in their,39
NA,sectors.,39
NA,The Howard government's main policy of,39
NA,cutting the research and development tax,39
NA,concession has produced a less than stellar,39
NA,performance. Policies that promote further,39
NA,investment in research and development are,39
NA,being actively pursued by many countries,39
NA,but this government only pays lip service to,39
NA,them. Let me take a moment to examine the,39
NA,targets set by other countries when it comes,39
NA,to R&D. China is committed to increasing,39
NA,research and development expenditure to 2.5,39
NA,per cent of GDP by the year 2020. The Euro-,39
NA,pean Union as a whole is targeting expendi-,39
NA,ture on R&D at three per cent of GDP by the,39
NA,year 2010.,39
NA,"All around us, our Asian neighbours are",39
NA,increasing their research and development,39
NA,spending at an incredibly rapid pace. As a,39
NA,local member representing the seat of Wer-,39
NA,"riwa, in the south-west of Sydney-an area I",39
NA,am very proud of-I point to the employ-,39
NA,ment statistics for the area to demonstrate the,39
NA,effect research and development will have on,39
NA,the development of our main industries. In,39
NA,"the south-west of Sydney, we have nearly",39
NA,"50,000 people employed in manufacturing. It",39
NA,is welcome news that the manufacturing sec-,39
NA,tor is taking seriously its responsibility for,39
NA,"R&D in the development of home products,",39
NA,"particularly in Werriwa, my area. Currently,",39
NA,manufacturing accounts for 41 per cent of,39
NA,Australia's research and development. Manu-,39
NA,facturing businesses are also the most likely,39
NA,in to commit to innovation and further devel-,39
NA,opment and to invest in their futures.,39
NA,The manufacturing industry recognises the,39
NA,need to be the one that is setting the pace in,39
NA,"the world, and not having it foisted upon it,",39
NA,simply being reactive to the position of other,39
NA,countries. We need to stimulate growth in the,39
NA,manufacturing sector. We need the sector to,40
NA,invest in its future. We are certainly seeing,40
NA,"some encouraging signs. In my backyard, in",40
NA,"the south-west of Sydney, various companies",40
NA,that I visit on a regular basis are now taking,40
NA,steps to invest in their future through re-,40
NA,search and development expenditure.,40
NA,The amendments contained in this bill,40
NA,"will, I believe, help contribute to the im-",40
NA,provement of Australia's research and devel-,40
NA,opment performance. They are vital and nec-,40
NA,essary. We do need to stimulate and encour-,40
NA,age expenditure in that area. To that extent,40
NA,support the provisions of the bill. Labor supneed,40
NA,"ports the proposals in the bill, particularly",40
NA,the proposals relating to R&D. In saying,40
NA,"that, however, it would be remiss of me not",40
NA,to note the time it has taken for this amend-,40
NA,ment bill to come before the House. The,40
NA,amendment bill was announced at the time of,40
NA,the last budget. I am talking about the budget,40
NA,"handed down in May 2006, not last night's",40
NA,budget. It has taken more than a year for the,40
NA,legislation to come before the House. Of,40
NA,"course, this is not the longest delay that we",40
NA,have seen in amendments coming before the,40
NA,House.,40
NA,Research and development tax conces-,40
NA,sions were introduced by the Labor govern-,40
NA,"ment in May 1986. Quite frankly, they have",40
NA,"had a chequered history, particularly under",40
NA,the current government. In the 1992-93,40
NA,budget speech of the then Labor government,40
NA,it was announced that the R&D concession,40
NA,would continue indefinitely. There was a,40
NA,commitment by a Labor government to in-,40
NA,"vest in the development of this country, par-",40
NA,"ticularly in manufacturing, by continuing",40
NA,that concession indefinitely.,40
NA,"In 1996, upon the election of the Howard",40
NA,"government, there was a slash and burn ap-",40
NA,proach to budgetary measures and that char-,40
NA,acterised the government's first few budgets.,40
NA,I am sure members will remember the cuts,40
NA,that were made and the ones we are still pay-,40
NA,"ing for. There are fewer doctors, certainly on",40
NA,"the Central Coast, and dentists. The Howard",40
NA,"government took it upon itself, among other",40
NA,"things, to reduce the R&D maximum conces-",40
NA,sion to 125 per cent. The government led the,40
NA,charge in discouraging people from investing,40
NA,in their futures. That is the legacy of this,40
NA,government. That is why it is scrambling,40
NA,now to redress those things. That is why we,40
NA,are falling behind other nations which have,40
NA,taken the positive approach of setting targets,40
NA,I for R&D into the future. That is why we,40
NA,to look forward and invest in ourselves.,40
NA,That is something we have advocated,40
NA,through successive Labor governments. It is,40
NA,good to see that the Howard government is,40
NA,now starting to take a leaf out of our book,40
NA,and at least return it to its former position,40
NA,prior to 1996.,40
NA,"In 2001, the government backflipped on",40
NA,its position when it produced a package,40
NA,called Backing Australia's Ability. In that,40
NA,package it introduced a premium rate of 175,40
NA,per cent for additional research and devel-,40
NA,opment activity and the research and devel-,40
NA,opment tax concession for small companies.,40
NA,While I say it has taken a long while for this,40
NA,"amendment bill to come before the House,",40
NA,"and I refer to last year's budget, the reality is",40
NA,that-and make no mistake about this-we,40
NA,have been waiting effectively since 2001 for,40
NA,this legislation to come before the House and,40
NA,to be implemented in a way that will stimu-,40
NA,late the growth of R&D within the business,40
NA,sector.,40
NA,I know that the government is now scram-,40
NA,bling to establish its credentials. I accept that,40
NA,it is an election year and the government has,40
NA,to do something about showing its sincerity,40
NA,in this regard. Last night when I went back to,40
NA,my rooms-as no doubt most members,40
NA,did-I started to go through the budget,40
NA,statements. Statement 1: Fiscal strategy and,40
NA,"budget priorities, under the heading ‘Creat-",41
NA,"ing opportunities for industry', states:",41
NA,This commitment is outlined in the industry,41
NA,"statement, Global Integration: Changing Mar-",41
NA,"kets, New Opportunities, which includes-",41
NA,among other things-,41
NA,$200 million over four years to expand access,41
NA,the 175 per cent research and development,41
NA,"(R&D) tax concession, to encourage multina-",41
NA,tional enterprises to increase the amount of,41
NA,they perform in Australia ...,41
NA,"That is welcomed, but I make the point that",41
NA,this highlights how the government is now,41
NA,scrambling to catch up and stimulate indus-,41
NA,"try to perform R&D, with a view to generat-",41
NA,ing not only productivity but also employ-,41
NA,ment in this country. One of the spin-offs of,41
NA,R&D is not simply the research and devel-,41
NA,opment that takes place but the all likelihood,41
NA,of the employment that it generates as a con-,41
NA,sequence of undertaking R&D in this coun-,41
NA,try.,41
NA,There is no doubt that the provisions con-,41
NA,tained in schedule 3 of this bill will improve,41
NA,"the research and development tax offset, par-",41
NA,ticularly by allowing companies more time,41
NA,to claim the offset. The amendment that al-,41
NA,lows all companies in a group to be covered,41
NA,by the research and development tax offset,41
NA,provisions will be welcomed not only by,41
NA,those businesses currently undertaking R&D,41
NA,"in Australia but also, more importantly, by",41
NA,those companies which are contemplating it.,41
NA,Given the importance of research and devel-,41
NA,opment to the longevity of a number of Aus-,41
NA,tralian businesses and industries and the im-,41
NA,portance of R&D in terms of building our,41
NA,"productive capacity, while these changes are",41
NA,"technical in nature, I agree they are welcome.",41
NA,"The reality of our global economy is that,",41
NA,"if we do not innovate, if we do not invest in",41
NA,"our future, our businesses and our industries,",41
NA,we are not likely to survive in that competi-,41
NA,tive market. That is why it is more important,41
NA,than ever for government to come to the ta-,41
NA,"ble with industry, to ensure that the arrange-",41
NA,ments in place are sufficient to maintain Aus-,41
NA,tralia's competitive position in the world,41
NA,economy. While the amendments in this bill,41
NA,"are welcome, when it comes to R&D, one",41
NA,to can only wonder whether they are enough.,41
Ms PLIBERSEK ,Sydney) (10.45 am)-,41
NA,I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment,41
NA,R&D (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007. I want to,41
NA,focus my comments on schedules 5 and 6 of,41
NA,the legislation. Schedule 5 will amend the,41
NA,list of deductible gift recipients in the tax,41
NA,legislation. Deductible gift recipient status,41
NA,will assist the listed organisations to attract,41
NA,public support for their activities. Schedule 6,41
NA,of the bill amends the tax legislation by ex-,41
NA,tending the eligibility for tax deductions for,41
NA,contributions to deductible gift recipients,41
NA,where an associated minor benefit is re-,41
NA,ceived with an eligible fundraising event.,41
NA,The government says that what they call,41
NA,the improvements to the taxation deductibil-,41
NA,ity provisions provide further support to en-,41
NA,courage greater philanthropy in the commu-,41
NA,"nity. Naturally, Labor support measures that",41
NA,encourage philanthropy in the community.,41
NA,We are pleased to see that this bill will lift,41
NA,some of the restrictions on the kinds of gifts,41
NA,which can be donated to organisations with,41
NA,deductible gift recipient status. Of course we,41
NA,support those changes.,41
NA,I want to talk more broadly about deducti-,41
NA,ble gift recipient status and about charities,41
NA,more generally. We have a proud record in,41
NA,Australia of giving to charities. The 2005,41
NA,report Giving Australia: research on philan-,41
NA,thropy in Australia estimated that the total,41
NA,"giving of money, goods and services to non-",41
NA,profit organisations by individuals and busi-,41
NA,nesses was about $11 billion per year. I no-,41
NA,ticed just this week that new reports of giv-,41
NA,"ing to charities put my own state, New South",41
NA,"Wales, at the top of the list per capita, having",41
NA,the most generous citizens when it comes to,42
NA,donating to charities.,42
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. DJC,42
NA,Kerr)-We always say Sydney has a big,42
NA,heart!,42
Ms PLIBERSEK,"We have a big heart,",42
NA,that is right. I know you are trying to pull my,42
NA,"leg here, Mr Deputy Speaker, but as the",42
NA,member for Sydney I see every day just how,42
NA,generous Australians are and just how gener-,42
NA,ous Sydneysiders are. My electorate of Syd-,42
NA,"ney, an inner city seat, is the location for a",42
NA,lot of charities and services-drug and alco-,42
NA,hol services and homeless services in par-,42
NA,ticular. We also have the head offices of a,42
NA,number of charities located in the Sydney,42
NA,"electorate. Many church groups, welfare ser-",42
NA,"vices, legal centres, environment groups,",42
NA,"gambling services, family support services,",42
NA,neighbourhood centres and health services,42
NA,are located in my electorate. I see the first-,42
NA,class work they do. I also see the sorts of,42
NA,people who rely on these charities every,42
NA,day-Australians who access homeless shel-,42
NA,"ters every night, young people in particular",42
NA,who are being helped to kick their drug and,42
NA,"alcohol addiction or gambling habits, or",42
NA,women and children leaving violent partners,42
NA,and looking for a safe place to live. These,42
NA,organisations in my electorate support people,42
NA,"living with HIV and AIDS, not only helping",42
NA,them with the usual domestic support and,42
NA,medical advice but also helping them to,42
NA,combat the social isolation which often goes,42
NA,with chronic illnesses such as HIV.,42
NA,I see a lot of people who are desperate for,42
NA,help accessing community legal services to,42
NA,"try to get some protection for their rights,",42
NA,protection which they are likely to miss out,42
NA,on without advocacy on their behalf. Day,42
NA,after day I see the charities and other organisome,42
NA,sations supporting some of the most disad-,42
NA,vantaged and marginalised citizens in the,42
NA,country. Many of the charities have deducti-,42
NA,ble gift recipient status. That means that they,42
NA,are allowed to receive donations which are,42
NA,tax deductible for the donor. The staff of,42
NA,these organisations are basically doing char-,42
NA,ity work also-they are certainly not being,42
NA,well recompensed. The deductible gift re-,42
NA,cipient status provides for organisations to,42
NA,allow their staff to salary package. Some-,42
NA,times that is the only way people can make,42
NA,ends meet. Deductible gift recipient status,42
NA,allows organisations to receive money from,42
NA,philanthropic trusts and grants and to use that,42
NA,money for innovative new projects.,42
NA,The point that needs to be made here is,42
NA,that Australian society relies more and more,42
NA,on charities as the government has with-,42
NA,drawn from providing some of the most ba-,42
NA,sic services to Australian people. There are a,42
NA,couple of examples in my electorate. An or-,42
NA,ganisation called the Luncheon Club AIDS,42
NA,Support Group started in my electorate in,42
NA,November 1993 and is a registered charity,42
NA,for taxation purposes. Every Monday the,42
NA,luncheon club offers lunch free of charge to,42
NA,people who are living with or affected by,42
NA,"HIV or AIDS. Families, friends, partners,",42
NA,carers and children come along to support,42
NA,their loved one. HIV sufferers are able to,42
NA,support each other and to build a social net-,42
NA,"work, and as well they get a nice lunch.",42
NA,"Until recently, the luncheon club has also",42
NA,"had a larder program, under which it has",42
NA,been able to provide food and other essential,42
NA,"items free of charge, because people who are",42
NA,living on the disability pension find it very,42
NA,difficult to pay for the medication they need,42
NA,"in order to combat their HIV, as well as all of",42
NA,their other associated expenses. The lunch-,42
NA,eon club is really struggling at the moment. I,42
NA,met with the organisation recently to go over,42
NA,of the things we can do to improve its,42
NA,financial situation. But this is just one or-,42
NA,ganisation; there are literally hundreds that,42
NA,support people who live in my electorate.,42
NA,While I support these measures that make,43
NA,it easier for Australians to donate to these,43
NA,"organisations, I make the point that in the",43
NA,last 12 months I have become increasingly,43
NA,worried about the number of organisations in,43
NA,my electorate that have lost their deductible,43
NA,gift recipient status. I know that a number of,43
NA,organisations have been audited recently by,43
NA,the Australian Taxation Office-some of,43
NA,them a number of times over a very short,43
NA,period-in order to establish that they meet,43
NA,the criteria for retaining DGR status. They,43
NA,are forced to go through what is really a very,43
NA,arduous process to prove that they are chari-,43
NA,ties-to itemise carefully all of their different,43
NA,"functions and the varied work they do, in",43
NA,order to show that they meet the criteria.,43
NA,"Apparently, the ATO has stepped up its",43
NA,auditing of non-profit organisations to ensure,43
NA,that they are entitled to the tax concessions,43
NA,that they are claiming. The ATO's compli-,43
NA,ance program priorities for 2005-06 include,43
NA,‘testing the integrity of endorsed deductible,43
NA,gift recipient status organisations and tax,43
NA,concessions charities'. Losing DGR status,43
NA,results in substantial financial losses for,43
NA,these organisations. Their staff effectively,43
NA,lose money because they are no longer able,43
NA,to salary package a proportion of their wage.,43
NA,They have an increased tax burden. They are,43
NA,no longer able to accept donations and they,43
NA,can no longer apply for or receive philan-,43
NA,thropic grants.,43
NA,"This move really began in 2003, when the",43
NA,government threatened to introduce the,43
NA,"charities bill, which sought to remove chari-",43
NA,table status from organisations which en-,43
NA,"gaged in advocacy. In short, the government",43
NA,"basically said, ‘If you help homeless people,",43
NA,"that's all right, but if you say there shouldn't",43
NA,"be so many homeless people, you become an",43
NA,advocate and you lose your funding.' It re-,43
NA,minded me of what Brazilian bishop Dom,43
NA,Helder Camara said:,43
NA,If I give food to the poor they call me a saint. If I,43
NA,"ask why the poor have no food, they call me a",43
NA,communist.,43
NA,It is important to note this threat of losing,43
NA,charitable status if you are advocating for the,43
NA,people that you are trying to help: instead of,43
NA,"just giving them handouts, if you actually",43
NA,"stick up for them, you are threatened with",43
NA,losing your charitable status. That is a very,43
NA,serious threat for these organisations.,43
NA,A great amount of work has been done by,43
NA,the Australia Institute. One of their reports,43
NA,shows that 70 per cent of organisations re-,43
NA,port that the funding restricts their ability to,43
NA,comment on government policy and that 76,43
NA,per cent of these organisations disagreed,43
NA,with the statement that current Australian,43
NA,political culture encourages public debate.,43
NA,"Firstly, these organisations fear that they will",43
NA,lose their public funding if they criticise the,43
NA,"government. Secondly, if they get no fund-",43
NA,"ing, how does the government get to them? If",43
NA,"they have no government funding, the way",43
NA,the government gets to them is by taking,43
NA,"their charitable status away from them, mak-",43
NA,ing sure that they are too frightened to make,43
NA,public comments. So the deductible gift re-,43
NA,cipient status audits are one way of intimi-,43
NA,dating some organisations. Losing their gov-,43
NA,"ernment funding is another. Another way, of",43
NA,"course, is the confidentiality agreements that",43
NA,charities are made to sign when they do a lot,43
NA,of-,43
NA,"Mr Dutton- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a",43
NA,point of order regarding relevance to the bill,43
NA,that is being debated at the moment. The,43
NA,honourable member made mention of sched-,43
NA,ule 5. Her contribution bears no relevance,43
NA,"whatsoever to schedule 5 of the bill, which",43
NA,extends gift recipient status to two specific,43
NA,organisations. The nonsense and the hollow,43
NA,rhetoric cannot be of assistance to this de-,43
NA,bate.,43
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,The minister,44
NA,cannot debate the matter under the guise of a,44
NA,point of order. I do understand the minister's,44
NA,comments but the chair has never been strict,44
NA,regarding the rules in relation to relevance.,44
NA,"There is a broad relevance, so I permit the",44
NA,debate to continue.,44
Ms PLIBERSEK,Are you trying to,44
NA,shut down the debate in here as well? You,44
NA,don't like the charities telling the truth about,44
NA,this government; you don't like members of,44
NA,the opposition telling the truth about this,44
NA,government either.,44
NA,"Mr Dutton-You're just a fraud, that's",44
NA,all. Stick to the facts.,44
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,44
NA,minister should not interject or he will not be,44
NA,able to make his reply.,44
Ms PLIBERSEK,Throw him out. I was,44
NA,"talking about deductible gift recipient status,",44
NA,"which, quite clearly, this legislation does",44
NA,"cover, and I was talking about confidentiality",44
NA,agreements for these organisations. Because,44
NA,the government has pulled out of providing a,44
NA,"whole lot of social services, it is asking the",44
NA,charities to provide those. Where the chari-,44
NA,"ties do pick up the contracts, they are asked",44
NA,"to sign a confidentiality agreement which,",44
NA,"again, prevents them from commenting when",44
NA,they believe that government policy is,44
NA,wrong.,44
NA,A study by Clive Hamilton and Sarah,44
NA,"Maddison of the Australia Institute, which I",44
NA,"mentioned a moment ago, called Silencing",44
NA,"dissent, shows that these organisations in",44
NA,many cases are clearly frightened of criticis-,44
NA,ing the government. One of the leaders in,44
NA,persecuting organisations that are advocates,44
NA,"has been the Institute of Public Affairs, a",44
NA,"conservative think tank which, incidentally,",44
NA,has charitable status and which has referred,44
NA,to these organisations as ‘cashed-up non-,44
NA,government organisations which are an un-,44
NA,representative dictatorship of the articulate'.,44
NA,"The Institute of Public Affairs, inciden-",44
NA,"tally, received $50,000 of government fund-",44
NA,ing to audit non-government organisations to,44
NA,determine whether they were legitimate rep-,44
NA,resentatives of the people whom they claim,44
NA,"as their clients. Incidentally, the Institute of",44
NA,"Public Affairs, which received this $50,000",44
NA,"in government funding, whilst it is a charita-",44
NA,"ble organisation, does not disclose its donors,",44
NA,which of course is one of the criticisms that,44
NA,it makes of these other organisations.,44
NA,"The churches, amongst other organisa-",44
NA,"tions, have really been caught in this sand-",44
NA,wich. If they are working to relieve poverty,44
NA,"once it is obvious in the community, that is",44
NA,okay; if they want to talk about why poverty,44
NA,"exists in a country as wealthy as Australia, at",44
NA,a time when it is raining cash from the re-,44
NA,"sources boom, then they have their charitable",44
NA,status threatened.,44
NA,"Obviously, no government likes to be",44
NA,criticised-none of us take it well. But pre-,44
NA,"vious governments have understood that, in a",44
NA,"healthy and strong democracy, people who",44
NA,advocate for the most disadvantaged mem-,44
NA,bers of our community should not be pun-,44
NA,ished for standing up for those people. It is,44
NA,"vital for democracy, in fact, to have people",44
NA,standing up for the most disadvantaged,44
NA,"members of our community, to make sure",44
NA,that their voices are represented when deci-,44
NA,sions are being made.,44
NA,Since the 2001 inquiry into the definition,44
NA,"of charities and related organisations, and the",44
NA,proposed charities bill in 2003-the bill that,44
NA,lapsed-many organisations have argued for,44
NA,a rethink on laws and regulations relating to,44
NA,charities. At the end of last year Jobs Austra-,44
NA,lia and ACOSS released a discussion paper,44
NA,floating an idea relating to the reform of,44
NA,"charities, the definition of a charity, regula-",44
NA,tions relating to charities and categorisation.,44
NA,They are calling for a more modern defini-,44
NA,tion of a charity. We are still working with a,44
NA,definition from 1891. It goes without saying,45
NA,that the role of these organisations has,45
NA,changed significantly since then. It may well,45
NA,be worth modernising and harmonising the,45
NA,regulation of various tax statuses so that the,45
NA,current confusions over whether an organisa-,45
NA,"tion is a charity, a public benevolent instituing-of",45
NA,tion or a deductible gift recipient are re-,45
NA,moved.,45
NA,ACOSS has suggested that we consider,45
NA,"the establishment of a charities commission,",45
NA,similar to the one in the UK. The commis-,45
NA,sion would act as a gatekeeper of charitable,45
NA,status at a federal level. It would mean that,45
NA,the regulation of many of these non-,45
NA,government organisations and their tax,45
NA,treatment would be at arm's length from the,45
NA,government. That would allow these organi-,45
NA,sations to continue to play the important role,45
NA,they play in the community without fearing,45
NA,"that, if they are too outspoken, they will",45
NA,their tax deductibility status. Advocates of a,45
NA,charities commission argue that it would,45
NA,streamline and improve the overall regula-,45
NA,tion of charities as well as harmonise the,45
NA,accountability requirements placed on chari-,45
NA,ties and deductible gift recipients by state,45
NA,and Commonwealth regulators and depart-,45
NA,ments. I think that is well worth considering.,45
NA,I mentioned some research earlier by,45
NA,Sarah Maddison and Clive Hamilton from,45
NA,the Australia Institute. There has been a great,45
NA,deal of very interesting research also under-,45
NA,"taken by another academic, Joan Staples, that",45
NA,goes through just how the government has,45
NA,used its funding and tax deductibility status,45
NA,to prevent a number of these organisations,45
NA,from saying what it is that they truly believe,45
NA,about the way that the most vulnerable peo-,45
NA,ple in Australian society have been treated.,45
NA,Joan Staples's research in this area is very,45
NA,relevant as well. This whole argument about,45
NA,the shutting down of the defenders of the,45
NA,most vulnerable people in the Australian,45
NA,community reminds me of what the founder,45
NA,"of the St Vincent de Paul Society, Frederic",45
NA,"Ozanam, said. He said, ‘Charity is the oil",45
NA,"being poured on the wounded traveller, but it",45
NA,is the role of justice to prevent the attack.' I,45
NA,think that any system that helps pour the oil,45
NA,on the wounded traveller is worth support-,45
NA,course I support that. But any sys-,45
NA,tem that actually prevents advocacy for jus-,45
NA,tice for those people has serious flaws.,45
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. DJC,45
NA,Kerr)-I thank the honourable member for,45
NA,Sydney. I apologise to the member for Syd-,45
NA,"ney for my intervention earlier in the debate,",45
NA,which led me to be less capable of adminis-,45
NA,tering admonishment to the minister when he,45
NA,later interjected.,45
Mr DUTTON ,Dickson-Minister for,45
NA,Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (11.05,45
NA,"am)-I thank you at the outset, Mr Deputy",45
NA,"Speaker, for acknowledging shortcomings,",45
NA,lose including your own. Can I say thank you,45
NA,very much to the members who have taken,45
NA,part in this debate on the Tax Laws Amend-,45
NA,ment (2007 Measures No. 2) Bill 2007-,45
NA,"except for the member for Sydney, I might",45
NA,say; that might have been the most painful,45
NA,10 minutes of debate I have had to sit,45
NA,through in this parliament. It is a pity that,45
NA,she does not have the capacity to contribute,45
NA,along the same lines as perhaps the member,45
NA,for Barton would have been able to-a per-,45
NA,son who is able to contribute constructively,45
NA,and honestly to debate in this place. The con-,45
NA,"tribution by the member for Sydney was,",45
NA,"frankly, nothing more than an attempt to",45
NA,muddy the facts with the diatribe that she,45
NA,normally goes on with. It really is a sad re-,45
NA,flection on her contribution in this place. I,45
NA,think the House should record the fact that,45
NA,the contribution that was made by the mem-,45
NA,ber for Sydney was not factual in any way.,45
NA,"Nonetheless, I want to acknowledge in par-",45
NA,"ticular the member for Mitchell, Mr Cadman,",45
NA,who I think provided an exceptional contri-,45
NA,bution to this debate. He obviously went,45
NA,through a very well-thought through process,46
NA,to compile his contribution. He should be,46
NA,recognised for that.,46
NA,I also want to comment on some of the,46
NA,points that were made by the member for,46
NA,"Prospect and, again, to correct some of the",46
NA,confusion and lack of factual basis in some,46
NA,of the comments that he made. The first,46
NA,point I make is that it takes time to amend,46
NA,law and to consult on the amendments. The,46
NA,opposition are running around this place and,46
NA,"in the business community, on one hand say-",46
NA,ing that we do not consult enough with busi-,46
NA,"ness and then, to a separate audience, saying",46
NA,that we take too long to implement changes,46
NA,and amendments to the law. The fact is that,46
NA,they cannot have it both ways. They cannot,46
NA,argue that we need a further process of con-,46
NA,sultation and then argue at the same time that,46
NA,we should be making these decisions in a,46
NA,shorter period of time. It is like the other,46
NA,process that they are indulging in at the mo-,46
NA,ment of telling one group that they can cut,46
NA,"government expenditure, yet running into the",46
NA,"next room and, in that speech, talking about",46
NA,"further government largesse, about how they",46
NA,would be able to provide more money for,46
NA,them were they in government. It is hypo-,46
NA,"critical, and it is a nonsense to suggest",46
NA,you can have one with the other. They are,46
NA,really showing their ignorance about the,46
NA,consultation process that is undertaken.,46
NA,The government remains very committed,46
NA,to conducting a timely consultation process.,46
NA,"But, when we talk about tax law, we are talk-",46
NA,ing about complicated amendments to the,46
NA,law. They need to be properly thought,46
NA,"through, and we need properly to be able to",46
NA,engage with people in the business commu-,46
NA,nity and with other stakeholders to make sure,46
NA,that we provide for best practice to keep,46
NA,economy going as well as it is in the current,46
NA,day.,46
NA,I also note the member for Prospect's,46
NA,claim that the government opposed referral,46
NA,of TLAB7 to a Senate committee. I encour-,46
NA,"age the member, again, to get his facts",46
NA,"straight on this issue, because it was the gov-",46
NA,ernment that initially sought to refer the bill.,46
NA,"Labor said that this was not needed, and then",46
NA,it was actually Labor which did the backflip,46
NA,to seek a referral of the bill. So that also,46
NA,"needs to be recorded, as part of my contribu-",46
NA,"tion to this debate, to correct some of the",46
NA,non-factual contributions made by those op-,46
NA,posite.,46
NA,Schedule 1 to this bill makes amendments,46
NA,to the capital allowance system to clarify,46
NA,"how mining, quarrying and prospecting",46
NA,rights are depreciated. The changes align the,46
NA,treatment of these assets more closely with,46
NA,other depreciating assets and ensure that the,46
NA,provisions operate as intended.,46
NA,Schedule 2 to this bill improves the fair-,46
NA,ness of the taxation rules applying to income,46
NA,"earned from certain boating activities, while",46
NA,ensuring that the tax system cannot be used,46
NA,to subsidise the private use of boats. This,46
NA,schedule implements the government's deci-,46
NA,sion to allow taxpayers to deduct expenses,46
NA,"denied under the current rules, up to the",46
NA,that amount of boating income earned.,46
NA,Schedule 3 to this bill improves the opera-,46
NA,tion of the R&D tax offset for small and me-,46
NA,"dium businesses, ensuring that the law re-",46
NA,flects the government's original policy intent,46
NA,for the offset. These amendments will ensure,46
NA,that all companies in a group are covered by,46
NA,the R&D tax offset provisions and extend the,46
NA,time companies have to choose the offset.,46
NA,The amendments will also allow companies,46
NA,to object to decisions made by the Commis-,46
NA,sioner of Taxation regarding the allowable,46
NA,"this amount of the offset. Further, the amend-",46
NA,ments ensure that the existing exception to,46
NA,"the minimum expenditure of $20,000 for",46
NA,contracted expenditure to a registered re-,46
NA,search agency applies to both R&D tax de-,47
NA,ductions and the R&D tax offset.,47
NA,Schedule 4 delivers the government's,47
NA,2006-07 budget announcement to extend the,47
NA,gift provisions to promote philanthropic giv-,47
NA,ing. The amendments will allow taxpayers to,47
NA,claim a tax deduction for the donation of,47
NA,certain publicly listed shares to deductable,47
NA,gift recipients. Schedule 5 to the bill further,47
NA,demonstrates the government's support for,47
NA,philanthropy by amending the list of deduc-,47
NA,table gift recipients in the tax legislation to,47
NA,extend the current listing for the Finding,47
NA,Sydney Foundation and to list the American,47
NA,Australian Association Ltd and the Bunbury,47
NA,Diocese Cathedral Rebuilding Fund. Deduc-,47
NA,table gift recipient status will assist these,47
NA,organisations to attract public support for,47
NA,"their activities. Further, schedule 6 to this",47
NA,extends the eligibility for tax deductions for,47
NA,contributions to deductable gift recipients,47
NA,where an associated minor benefit is re-,47
NA,ceived with an eligible fundraising event.,47
NA,Schedule 7 of this bill makes technical,47
NA,amendments to ensure that the definition of,47
NA,‘exempt entity' covers all entities exempt,47
NA,under the income tax law. Schedule 8 to this,47
NA,bill amends the venture capital regime to,47
NA,relax the eligibility requirements for foreign,47
NA,residents investing in venture capital limited,47
NA,partnerships and Australian venture capital,47
NA,funds. It introduces a new set of taxation,47
NA,concessions for Australian residents and for-,47
NA,eign residents investing in early-stage ven-,47
NA,ture capital activities. This is achieved,47
NA,through a new investment vehicle called an,47
NA,‘early-stage venture capital limited partner-,47
NA,ship'.,47
NA,The $250 million divestment requirement,47
NA,is reasonable because the government is in-,47
NA,troducing generous tax concessions for early-,47
NA,stage vehicles. Given the emphasis on start-,47
NA,"up and seed capital, the need for ongoing tax",47
NA,concessions once an entity reaches the size,47
NA,"of $250 million diminishes. Moreover, if the",47
NA,partnership divests the entity into a venture,47
NA,capital limited partnership as it approaches,47
NA,"the $250 million limit, it can continue to at-",47
NA,tract tax-free gains without any divestment,47
NA,requirement. The requirement to divest once,47
NA,an entity reaches $250 million applies for up,47
NA,to six months after the end of an income,47
NA,"year, and this provides ample opportunity for",47
NA,divestment to occur. This measure further,47
NA,demonstrates that the government's ongoing,47
NA,"support for new business continues, and the",47
NA,promotion of industry innovation will always,47
NA,be supported by this government.,47
NA,I thank those members who have partici-,47
NA,"pated in this debate, and I commend the bill",47
NA,to the House.,47
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. DJC,47
NA,bill Kerr)-The original question was that this,47
NA,bill be now read a second time. To this the,47
NA,honourable member for Prospect has moved,47
NA,as an amendment that all words after ‘That',47

Ms MACKLIN ,Jagajaga) (11.15 am)-,48
NA,This bill is the next legislative stage in the,48
NA,government's 2006 reforms to the child sup-,48
NA,"port system. The Families, Community Ser-",48
NA,vices and Indigenous Affairs Legislation,48
NA,Amendment (Child Support Reform Con-,48
NA,solidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007,48
NA,contains a significant number of technical,48
NA,and consequential amendments following,48
NA,from the original two pieces of child support,48
NA,reform legislation considered by the parlia-,48
NA,ment last year. Labor supported these previ-,48
NA,ous child support reform bills in the parlia-,48
NA,"ment, after expressing our reservations that",48
NA,the government had failed to provide protec-,48
NA,"tion for low-income families, who may lose",48
NA,income as a result of the changes to the,48
NA,scheme. Labor will support the legislation,48
NA,"before us today. However, we remain con-",48
NA,cerned about protection for low-income,48
NA,"families, which has not to date been ade-",48
NA,quately resolved. I move:,48
NA,That all words after “That” be omitted with a,48
NA,view to substituting the following words: “whilst,48
NA,"not declining to give the bill a second reading,",48
NA,House expresses its serious concern that the Gov-,48
NA,ernment's child support reforms do not provide,48
NA,adequate protection against income reductions for,48
NA,low income households raising children”.,48
NA,The bill also incorporates relevant amend-,48
NA,ments relocated from the Child Support Leg-,48
NA,"islation Amendment Bill 2004, which Labor",48
NA,was intending to support. We note that the,48
NA,government is set to withdraw that bill from,48
NA,the Notice Paper and we are happy for that,48
NA,to occur. This amendment bill includes a,48
NA,range of non child support changes to vari-,48
NA,"ous pensions and family payments, including",48
NA,the payment of the baby bonus in instalments,48
NA,to mothers aged under 18 years and the ex-,48
NA,"tension of the pension assets test, from 12",48
NA,"months to 24 months, following the sale of",48
NA,the principal home. Labor welcomes both of,48
NA,these initiatives. Not only are they good pol-,48
NA,icy; they are also suggestions that we put,48
NA,forward in the first place. If the government,48
NA,"continues to run out of fresh ideas, we are",48
NA,obviously keen to help.,48
NA,"The Child Support Scheme was, as I am",48
NA,"sure everyone is aware, set up in 1988 by the",48
NA,"Hawke Labor government, and it has become",48
NA,an international model and the basis of a,48
NA,similar scheme established in the United,48
NA,"Kingdom. I do, however, acknowledge the",48
NA,"genuine concerns about the scheme, includ-",48
NA,"ing the fairness of the scheme, the assess-",48
NA,"ment formula and, in particular, compliance.",48
NA,I reiterate that Labor acknowledges the need,48
NA,for reform of our child support system. The,48
NA,"view we take to the reform challenge, how-",48
NA,"ever, is that fundamentally the interests and",48
NA,wellbeing of children must come first and,48
NA,"that, as far as possible, child support policies",48
NA,should serve to support the child in secure,48
NA,and in economically acceptable conditions.,48
NA,"When it comes to child support, the re-",48
NA,form process has been lengthy. The House of,48
NA,Representatives Standing Committee on,48
NA,the Family and Community Affairs report Every,48
NA,picture tells a story dealt with child support,48
NA,and other family separation issues and made,48
NA,29 bipartisan recommendations. Among its,48
NA,recommendations was the establishment of a,48
NA,ministerial task force to evaluate the Child,48
NA,"Support Scheme, including establishing the",48
NA,costs of children's upbringing after parental,48
NA,"separation, recognising the different income",48
NA,levels of households and reflecting the costs,48
NA,for both parents of maintaining meaningful,48
NA,contact with their children.,48
NA,The May 2005 report of the Ministerial,49
NA,"Taskforce on Child Support, otherwise",49
NA,"known as the Parkinson report, was the first",49
NA,systematic evaluation of child support ar-,49
NA,rangements. It recommended a new formula,49
NA,for child support assessment based on evi-,49
NA,"dence of the actual costs of raising children,",49
NA,the shared parental responsibility for those,49
NA,costs and recognition of each parent's level,49
NA,"of care. The report examined the scheme,",49
NA,"using sound principles, and it was generally",49
NA,well received. Labor believes that the report,49
NA,provides a constructive basis for moving,49
NA,forward on child support reform.,49
NA,Last year the parliament passed two bills,49
NA,which implemented this new Child Support,49
NA,"Scheme, including a new payment formula.",49
NA,While not all the recommendations of the,49
NA,Parkinson report were adopted and the new,49
NA,"scheme was not entirely to our satisfaction,",49
NA,"Labor did support those bills. As I said, to-",49
NA,day's bill makes further amendments to the,49
NA,new Child Support Scheme. It is a lengthy,49
NA,"bill, with 12 schedules and 178 pages, so I",49
NA,am not going to be able to cover all the,49
NA,"amendments. But I do want to touch on, in",49
NA,"particular, a number of issues which were",49
NA,raised in evidence given just last week at the,49
NA,Senate inquiry into this bill. The first issue is,49
NA,that these proposed amendments have not,49
NA,raised many new concerns-many of the,49
NA,concerns raised at the Senate inquiry were,49
NA,also raised when the original bill was de-,49
NA,"bated. The second issue, which is perhaps",49
NA,"related to the first, is that the new Child",49
NA,port Scheme is still contentious and many of,49
NA,"the previous concerns, especially with regard",49
NA,"to the impact of the new regime, have not",49
NA,been fully addressed.,49
NA,"The Department of Families, Community",49
NA,"Services and Indigenous Affairs, the agency",49
NA,"responsible for child support policy, told the",49
NA,Senate inquiry that the implementation of the,49
NA,new regime is not progressing as smoothly as,49
NA,should be expected. The promised stake-,49
NA,holder reference group has met only once,49
NA,this year and there is still a lack of detailed,49
NA,information on the impact on families of the,49
NA,new formula and the new arrangements. Giv-,49
NA,ing evidence at the recent Senate inquiry into,49
NA,"the bill, Jaqueline Taylor, from the National",49
NA,Council of Single Mothers and their Chil-,49
NA,"dren, said:",49
NA,… calculating the financial impact on single,49
NA,mother families post July next year has actually,49
NA,been an incredibly difficult thing to do because,49
NA,there is nothing available to help us with that.,49
NA,There has been no modelling done by the gov-,49
NA,ernment to actually calculate the impact that these,49
NA,changes will have on sole parent families and we,49
NA,cannot forget that this is also in conjunction with,49
NA,Welfare to Work and the loss of income from that.,49
NA,So I ask the government to make this issue a,49
NA,priority and do the necessary research to look,49
NA,at the impacts of the changes that have been,49
NA,enacted. We believe that the government has,49
NA,a responsibility to make sure that the wellbe-,49
NA,ing of children is not compromised by the,49
NA,"combined impact of these policy changes,",49
NA,especially the Welfare to Work changes. We,49
NA,acknowledge the concerns of many resident,49
NA,parents that they will receive lower child,49
NA,support payments under the new formula.,49
NA,"At the request of the ministerial task force,",49
NA,NATSEM modelled some of the impacts of,49
NA,the new formula. That modelling showed,49
NA,resident parents on annual incomes of,49
NA,"$26,000 or less will incur the biggest reduc-",49
NA,tions in child support payments. For exam-,49
NA,"Sup- ple, where the non-resident parent earns",49
NA,"$78,000, a resident parent with an income of",49
NA,"$26,000 will be $50 a week worse off. That",49
NA,is certainly a lot of money for a parent earn-,49
NA,"ing $26,000 a year. These families are al-",49
NA,ready amongst the most economically mar-,49
NA,ginalised in the country. Ninety-one per cent,49
NA,"of these families, according to the Child",49
NA,"Support Agency's own data, are headed by",49
NA,mothers. Only four per cent of these families,49
NA,"have incomes over $50,000 a year and 75 per",49
NA,cent raise their children on incomes below,50
NA,"$20,000. We know that supporting parents",50
NA,who are getting by without paid work or are,50
NA,managing on low part-time wages are fre-,50
NA,quently surviving on incomes well below the,50
NA,poverty line. So more account certainly,50
NA,"needs to be taken of these issues, and we",50
NA,look forward to the research being done by,50
NA,the department.,50
NA,It is also important that we look at these,50
NA,changes in the context of not only the new,50
NA,system that has been put in place but also the,50
NA,recent Welfare to Work changes that are hav-,50
NA,ing a big impact on many of these families.,50
NA,"On the one hand, we have family law and",50
NA,child support law encouraging shared parent-,50
NA,ing and an acknowledgement that between,50
NA,35 per cent and 65 per cent of care is consid-,50
NA,"ered to be shared. On the other hand, under",50
NA,the income support policies of this govern-,50
NA,ment's Welfare to Work changes only one,50
NA,"parent can be given principal carer status,",50
NA,and the important concessions in terms of,50
NA,activity requirements can leave the other,50
NA,parent and the children exceptionally vulner-,50
NA,able. I would like to quote Ms Taylor from,50
NA,the National Council of Single Mothers and,50
NA,their Children again. She said this about a,50
NA,case presented by the council to the Senate,50
NA,inquiry:,50
NA,There is one in particular where a single mum in,50
NA,country Victoria has shared care of her toddler,50
NA,"child, a very young child. She does not have prin-",50
NA,cipal carer status because her partner bullied her,50
NA,into making sure he got it. Centrelink assigned it,50
NA,to him. They have within the 10 per cent range of,50
NA,"the fifty-fifty, so Centrelink have made their deci-",50
NA,sion against her in favour of him. So she is what,50
NA,is known as a generic job seeker where she is on,50
NA,Newstart with child rate but has full-time obliga-,50
NA,tions to look for work and to do anything that the,50
NA,Job Network requires of her to accept full-time,50
NA,employment. She has none of the protections that,50
NA,you get with principal carer status such as part-,50
NA,"time work, no suitable child care available, the",50
NA,60-minute travel rule-hers is 90 minutes. She,50
NA,"has no access to a pensioner concession card, so",50
NA,she is in a seriously disadvantaged situation.,50
NA,Labor is closely monitoring the impact of the,50
NA,"intersection of the Welfare to Work laws, the",50
NA,"importance of principal carer status, the",50
NA,promotion of shared care under family law,50
NA,and these child support changes to make sure,50
NA,that parents with largely shared caring re-,50
NA,sponsibility are not disadvantaged.,50
NA,I wish to turn to some other provisions in,50
NA,the bill. As far as the administrative review,50
NA,"provisions are concerned, the bill makes",50
NA,technical changes to the process of adminis-,50
NA,trative and judicial review of decisions in,50
NA,child support cases by the Social Security,50
NA,Appeals Tribunal-the SSAT-or by the,50
NA,courts. One of these changes concerns ‘out,50
NA,of time' applications to the SSAT for a re-,50
NA,view of a child support decision. Currently,50
NA,the executive director of the SSAT has 60,50
NA,days to make a decision about allowing such,50
NA,"an application, and if the decision is not",50
NA,taken in the time frame the application is,50
NA,deemed to have been refused. This deeming,50
NA,"provision will be removed by this bill and,",50
NA,"according to the explanatory memorandum,",50
NA,the mechanism for ensuring timeliness in,50
NA,decision making will be left to ‘other mecha-,50
NA,"nisms, such as the SSAT's reporting re-",50
NA,"quirements'. Clearly, the inflexibility of the",50
NA,deeming provisions could cause problems.,50
NA,"However, relying on vague mechanisms such",50
NA,as ‘reporting requirements' does not neces-,50
NA,sarily adequately address the issue of delays.,50
NA,"The Law Council of Australia, in its submis-",50
NA,"sion to the Senate inquiry into the bill, ex-",50
NA,pressed concern over item 64 of the bill's,50
NA,schedule 1. This provision gives the SSAT,50
NA,the power to make a determination about,50
NA,which documents are relevant to the review,50
NA,of its decision by the court conducting that,50
NA,review. The Law Council is ‘concerned,50
NA,about the appropriateness of this amendment',50
NA,and believes it is preferable that the court be,50
NA,entitled to review all documents to determine,50
NA,which are relevant in a decision on the mat-,51
NA,ter before it.,51
NA,The bill also makes amendments to clarify,51
NA,situations when a court makes orders for the,51
NA,repayment of child support where payments,51
NA,have been made by a person who is not the,51
NA,parent of the child. Under these provisions a,51
NA,mere suspicion on the part of either parent,51
NA,that the payer was not the parent of the child,51
NA,is a factor relevant for the court to consider,51
NA,"in making an order on possible repayment,",51
NA,even when this suspicion or knowledge falls,51
NA,short of a reasonable doubt about parentage.,51
NA,Another proposed section goes to the,51
NA,grounds for departure from the formula in,51
NA,relation to stepchildren. The new regime al-,51
NA,lows for the child support formula to be de-,51
NA,parted from where the family cares for a,51
NA,stepchild. Any consideration of the appropri-,51
NA,ateness of a departure in these circumstances,51
NA,requires consideration of the effects of such,51
NA,"an order on the parents, the child support",51
NA,children and any other persons that the par-,51
NA,"ents have a duty to support. However, cur-",51
NA,rently the effect on a stepchild is not considposition,51
NA,ered. The amendments will include consid-,51
NA,eration of the effect on the stepchild.,51
NA,Schedule 5 deals with changes to the,51
NA,maintenance income test provisions in the A,51
NA,New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act,51
NA,1999. These amendments will clarify the,51
NA,definitions of ‘amount received' and ‘amount,51
NA,payable' in the child support formula. They,51
NA,will also clarify that maintenance income,51
NA,received by a payee for one or more children,51
NA,will reduce the payee's amount of family tax,51
NA,benefit part A above the base rate for those,51
NA,children only.,51
NA,Currently ongoing child support can only,51
NA,be collected from employers if the payer is a,51
NA,wage or salary earner or they receive a Cen-,51
NA,trelink payment. This amendment in the bill,51
NA,today will broaden the agency's power to,51
NA,issue notices requiring the deduction of child,51
NA,support and the forwarding of that deduction,51
NA,to the Child Support Agency to include cases,51
NA,where the payer is under contract for service,51
NA,"arrangements that are, effectively, substitut-",51
NA,ing for wages. This change effectively ex-,51
NA,tends the reach of the ongoing collection,51
NA,system to independent contractors who are,51
NA,employees. Labor supports this change.,51
NA,Other aspects of the family payment system,51
NA,"are also amended by the bill but, given the",51
NA,"time available, I just want to indicate our",51
NA,support for those.,51
NA,"Another significant change in this bill, un-",51
NA,"related to child support, is to require that the",51
NA,baby bonus be paid in 13 instalments to par-,51
NA,ents under the age of 18. There is an unfortu-,51
NA,nate tendency for some to portray young,51
NA,mums in a negative fashion. I certainly do,51
NA,"not support that sort of reporting. However,",51
NA,it has been noticed among some welfare,51
NA,groups and social workers that there have,51
NA,been disturbing occurrences of young moth-,51
NA,ers being abused and exploited over their,51
NA,baby bonus payments. Young women are in a,51
NA,of special vulnerability when it,51
NA,comes to these issues. Some domestic vio-,51
NA,lence services have reported levels of abuse,51
NA,rising sharply around the time the bonus is,51
NA,"paid. Unfortunately, it is true that women are",51
NA,handing over the money just to get rid of a,51
NA,violent partner. There are far too many sto-,51
NA,ries of young mothers being exploited for,51
NA,their baby bonus money. Governments have,51
NA,a responsibility to make sure that efforts to,51
NA,help families at a critical time are not misdi-,51
NA,rected by desperate or selfish people to have,51
NA,children they neither want nor care for.,51
NA,On this basis we support the government's,51
NA,changes to fortnightly payments for young,51
NA,mothers-something we have been pressing,51
NA,for. We also support the common sense,51
NA,change in the name for the maternity pay-,51
NA,ment to be officially known by what we all,51
NA,call it-the baby bonus. All family payments,51
NA,will now also be conditional on the registra-,51
NA,tion of the birth. Some people might find this,52
NA,amendment surprising but such a change will,52
NA,be helpful.,52
NA,"In their submission to the Senate inquiry,",52
NA,the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that,52
NA,the registration requirement would improve,52
NA,the accuracy of Australia's demographic sta-,52
NA,tistical collections. They said:,52
NA,Births to mothers in their 30s are more likely to,52
NA,be registered promptly whereas births to younger,52
NA,mothers aged under 24 years were likely to be,52
NA,registered later. It is expected that the proposed,52
NA,requirement to have all births registered before,52
NA,applying for the baby bonus may result in a,52
NA,change in parents' behaviour.,52
NA,We hope that the change will be positive and,52
NA,that the tendency for late registration of,52
NA,births among those from very disadvantaged,52
NA,backgrounds will be reduced.,52
NA,Of all births registered in Australia in,52
NA,"2005, 22 per cent of Indigenous births oc-",52
NA,curred in 2004 or earlier. So there is evidence,52
NA,in the Indigenous community of the need for,52
NA,"this change. For exnuptial births, where pa-",52
NA,ternity was not acknowledged or where a,52
NA,mother is not married and the father's details,52
NA,"are not on the birth certificate, over 23 per",52
NA,cent of births registered in 2005 were for,52
NA,babies born in 2004 or earlier. This new re-,52
NA,quirement must be implemented in such a,52
NA,way that those with particular vulnerabilities,52
NA,are not disadvantaged. We do not want them,52
NA,to be missing out on any payments and I,52
NA,hope that those responsible will make sure,52
NA,that the parents who are vulnerable know the,52
NA,full implications of this change.,52
NA,The other Labor proposal that the gov-,52
NA,ernment is adopting in this bill is an amend-,52
NA,ment to the Social Security Act and the Vet-,52
NA,erans' Entitlements Act to extend the pension,52
NA,"assets test exemption period, from 12 months",52
NA,"to 24 months, following the sale of the prin-",52
NA,cipal home. Labor proposed an amendment,52
NA,to the Social Security Act in 2006 along,52
NA,similar lines to support pensioners who were,52
NA,unable to have their new home built during,52
NA,the 12-month period due to delays caused by,52
NA,the skills shortage. The 12-month rule was,52
NA,particularly affecting pensioners trying to,52
NA,build a new home and being delayed by the,52
NA,"serious skills crisis that, frankly, is a respon-",52
NA,sibility of this government.,52
NA,"Under the current arrangements, a person",52
NA,has 12 months to sell their existing home and,52
NA,construct a new home before the proceeds of,52
NA,the sale of their existing home become an,52
NA,assessable asset. Because of the huge skills,52
NA,shortage and therefore the delay in building,52
NA,"completion dates, a number of pensioners",52
NA,have been unable to get their home com-,52
NA,pleted within the 12-month time frame. Sto-,52
NA,ries of people waiting for tradespeople to,52
NA,turn up are very well known to everyone.,52
NA,Labor was concerned about the impact on,52
NA,pensioners of the delays that forced them to,52
NA,be caught up in these assets test rules. It now,52
NA,"appears that the government has caught up,",52
NA,and I am pleased to see this change in this,52
NA,bill.,52
NA,The changes to the remote area allowance,52
NA,are also welcome. The remote area allow-,52
NA,ance is a payment for income support recipi-,52
NA,ents who receive no or little benefit from the,52
NA,income zone tax offset through the tax sys-,52
NA,tem. It is incomeand asset-test free and paid,52
NA,"at single and couple rates, with an additional",52
NA,rate for each dependent child. The child sup-,52
NA,port reforms that take effect from July 2008,52
NA,introduce the concept of a ‘regular care,52
NA,child'. That is a child who is cared for by a,52
NA,parent for at least 14 per cent and less than,52
NA,35 per cent of the time. The bill provides for,52
NA,the rate of remote area allowance to be in-,52
NA,creased by an additional allowance for each,52
NA,regular care child in a family in addition to,52
NA,each FTB child. So it does provide extra,52
NA,"support to families, and it is welcomed by",52
NA,Labor.,52
NA,We also support the changes to allow fam-,53
NA,ily tax benefits to continue to be paid to,53
NA,members of the Australian Defence Force,53
NA,and members of the Australian Federal Po-,53
NA,lice International Deployment Group who,53
NA,are deployed overseas. Normally FTB is only,53
NA,payable at the full rate to people temporarily,53
NA,overseas for up to 13 weeks. Discretion to,53
NA,extend that period exists where certain pre-,53
NA,scribed events prevent or delay their return.,53
NA,"Presently, ADF and AFP personnel on over-",53
NA,seas deployment are not covered adequately,53
NA,by this discretion. This bill makes amend-,53
NA,ments to rectify that deficiency.,53
NA,"So, as I have indicated, Labor supports",53
NA,"this lengthy amendment bill. However, I do",53
NA,want to reiterate our serious and ongoing,53
NA,concerns with the impact of the new Child,53
NA,Support Scheme on low-income families.,53

The DEPUTY SPEAKER,I thank the,53

Ms GEORGE ,Throsby) (11.38 am)-,53
NA,The bill before us for debate today-the,53
NA,"Families, Community Services and Indige-",53
NA,nous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child,53
NA,Support Reform Consolidation and Other,53
NA,Measures) Bill 2007-follows two substan-,53
NA,tial pieces of legislation that were debated,53
NA,last year. Those bills arose in response to the,53
NA,bipartisan recommendations of the original,53
NA,report of the House of Representatives,53
NA,Standing Committee on Family and Com-,53
NA,"munity Affairs, Every picture tells a story. I",53
NA,was pleased to be a member of that commit-,53
NA,"tee, which worked very hard to try and insti-",53
NA,tute some very fundamental changes both to,53
NA,family law and to the Child Support Scheme,53
NA,and the formula in particular. It was left to,53
NA,the committee chaired by Professor Parkin-,53
NA,son to come up with a range of detailed rec-,53
NA,ommendations that go to the heart of the,53
NA,Child Support Scheme.,53
NA,The government announced major,53
NA,"changes to the scheme in February last year,",53
NA,"and, as I say, today is part of the ongoing",53
NA,process of trying to give effect to the rec-,53
NA,ommendations of both the House of Repre-,53
NA,sentatives committee and the Parkinson task,53
NA,force.,53
NA,The bill before us today contains a num-,53
NA,ber of significant technical and consequential,53
NA,amendments that flow from the original leg-,53
NA,islation. It also incorporates relevant,53
NA,amendments relocated from the Child Sup-,53
NA,port Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The,53
NA,shadow minister has spoken at length on a,53
NA,number of the proposals contained in this bill,53
NA,and the proposed changes. I do not intend to,53
NA,"elaborate on those in any greater detail, be-",53
NA,( Mr cause I want to focus my remarks specifi-,53
NA,cally on matters relating to child support.,53
NA,"As the shadow minister, the member for",53
NA,"Jagajaga, outlined to the House, the introduc-",53
NA,tion of the child support system back in 1988,53
NA,was a very important and innovative measure,53
NA,introduced by the Hawke Labor government.,53
NA,It was important at that time because it,53
NA,aimed to strike a fair balance between public,53
NA,and private forms of support for children,53
NA,"where marriages had broken down, and to",53
NA,alleviate the poverty that we all know exists,53
NA,"in sole parent families, particularly those",53
NA,struggling families with mum at the head of,53
NA,the family unit. We all know that sole parent,53
NA,families raising children are likely to be very,53
NA,much at the bottom of the income scale and,53
NA,at the bottom of the scale in terms of wellbe-,53
NA,ing and living standards.,53
NA,So we on this side of the chamber have,53
NA,always had a view that any child support,53
NA,"policy must put the interests of children first,",53
NA,must aim to reduce child poverty and must,53
NA,operate in a way that encourages both par-,53
NA,"ents, post separation, to continue to contrib-",53
NA,ute to their children's wellbeing. It must,54
NA,courage both parents to maintain ongoing,54
NA,"roles in their children's lives. We, as mem-",54
NA,"bers of parliament, know that hitherto that",54
NA,"often has not been the case. So I do, in",54
NA,"eral terms, welcome many of the long-",54
NA,overdue changes that will come with the in-,54
NA,troduction of the staged changes to the sys-,54
NA,"tem and to the formula in particular. But, as",54
NA,"the member for Jagajaga made clear, our",54
NA,support for the package overall continues to,54
NA,be conditional on improved protection,54
NA,against income reductions for low-income,54
NA,households raising children. I will return to,54
NA,that point a little later.,54
NA,"I think it was regrettable that, as members",54
NA,"of this House, we were not in a position to",54
NA,debate the changes to the Child Support,54
NA,Scheme and the formula as a total package.,54
NA,"If we had been able to, it would have been",54
NA,easier for all of us to assess the winners and,54
NA,the losers and to take into account the equity,54
NA,considerations of justice and fairness that,54
NA,have to be part of the eventual outcomes. As,54
NA,"we know, these changes are coming in three",54
NA,tranches. Today we are debating some of,54
NA,"those changes, but the final package of re-",54
NA,forms will only come into existence in July,54
NA,next year.,54
NA,You cannot argue against the fact that the,54
NA,existing formula has been the cause of a,54
NA,great deal of angst in the community. Re-,54
NA,search undertaken by the Australian Institute,54
NA,of Family Studies found that more than 60,54
NA,per cent of non-resident fathers and 45 per,54
NA,cent of resident mothers think the system is,54
NA,not working well. This was substantially,54
NA,confirmed in the evidence that came before,54
NA,us in the inquiry that led to the very impor-,54
NA,"tant, ground-breaking report, Every picture",54
NA,"tells a story. As I and all MPs know, many",54
NA,constituents who have come to see us have,54
NA,raised concerns about the application of a,54
NA,formula that they perceived to encompass,54
NA,many anomalies and that they believed,54
NA,enneeded to be rectified. So the changes that,54
NA,we have already seen are generally wel-,54
NA,comed and supported. I want to refer to some,54
NA,of these because they are matters that have,54
NA,gen- been the cause of complaint to me as the,54
NA,member for Throsby.,54
NA,"From July 2006, when the first major re-",54
NA,"forms came into being, we recognised non-",54
NA,resident parents on income support who have,54
NA,contact with their children for at least one,54
NA,night a week by the payment of a higher al-,54
NA,lowance. We enabled parents who pay child,54
NA,support to spend a greater percentage of their,54
NA,payments directly on their children and to,54
NA,nominate the areas that they wanted those,54
NA,funds to be targeted at. So up to 30 per cent,54
NA,of child support payments can now in fact be,54
NA,directly attributed to the desire of the non-,54
NA,resident parent as to how that expenditure,54
NA,should be met. We have certainly beefed up,54
NA,action to ensure child support is paid on time,54
NA,and in full. We all know cases where people,54
NA,have deliberately avoided their responsibili-,54
NA,ties for payment of child support. We also,54
NA,know of the huge number of people in the,54
NA,system who were paying just the bare mini-,54
NA,mum of $5 a week. Compliance was a prob-,54
NA,"lem, with only around half of all parents",54
NA,"making their payments in full and on time,",54
NA,and I want to say a bit about that in a mo-,54
NA,ment.,54
NA,There was some debate about the reduc-,54
NA,"tion in the cap at the top level, where we saw",54
NA,"the cap reduced from around $140,000 to",54
NA,"$105,000. But I do believe that, in the con-",54
NA,"text of the total package, this change will",54
NA,bring payments much more into line with the,54
NA,actual costs of raising children. We improved,54
NA,support for separating families through the,54
NA,family relationship centres. I am very,54
NA,"pleased that we have one in Wollongong,",54
NA,"which I have visited, and I know the great",54
NA,job that it is performing in assisting local,54
NA,families. We increased minimum payments.,54
NA,"In my view they are not sufficient, but they",54
NA,have gone up from $5 a week to just over $6,55
NA,and in future will be indexed to the CPI.,55
NA,"In the second stage of the changes, operathe",55
NA,"tive from January this year, there is now the",55
NA,capacity for an independent review of Child,55
NA,Support Agency decisions through the Social,55
NA,Security Appeals Tribunal. Many parents,55
NA,who have visited me have complained about,55
NA,the high legal costs in challenging decisions,55
NA,of the CSA when they have to go through a,55
NA,court process. I think it will remove the im-,55
NA,mense financial burden on people who are,55
NA,unhappy with outcomes as a result of deci-,55
NA,sions made by the agencies.,55
NA,"Importantly, too, since January this year",55
NA,parents will be provided with more time to,55
NA,work out their parenting arrangements before,55
NA,their family payments are affected. Previ-,55
NA,"ously, a separated parent was allowed only",55
NA,28 days in which to take action to obtain,55
NA,child support payments before their family,55
NA,tax benefit A payments were affected. This,55
NA,"time frame, as I know from personal experi-",55
NA,"ence, often caused conflict between separat-",55
NA,"ing parents, often undermining their ability",55
NA,to reach agreement on parenting arrange-,55
NA,"ments or, in some cases, even to reconcile",55
NA,the differences which led to the breakdown,55
NA,in their marriage or relationship. I am,55
NA,"pleased that, from January this year, the time",55
NA,limit will be extended from 28 days to 13,55
NA,weeks.,55
NA,Early indications of the impact of these,55
NA,legislative changes have in fact been very,55
NA,heartening. Recent data from the Child Sup-,55
NA,port Agency showed that more separated or,55
NA,divorced couples are now embracing shared,55
NA,parenting arrangements-not as much as we,55
NA,"would like, but it is heading in the right",55
NA,rection-and that an increasing number of,55
NA,fathers are taking on the role of primary,55
NA,carer. In 2006 about 21 per cent of new cases,55
NA,"listed fathers as the primary care giver,",55
NA,pared with just 7½ per cent in 1997. I am,55
NA,pleased to see an increase in contact between,55
NA,"non-custodial parents and their children, with",55
NA,number of those parents who see their,55
NA,children 30 per cent or more of nights a year,55
NA,doubling-from a low base but nevertheless,55
NA,doubling-in the recent period. I think these,55
NA,factors are a growing indication of changes,55
NA,"in attitude in custody disputes, which is a",55
NA,"good thing, especially for children in situa-",55
NA,tions of marital breakdown.,55
NA,I am also pleased that the Child Support,55
NA,Agency and the tax office have been more,55
NA,proactive in putting the squeeze on what are,55
NA,described as child support cheats. We all,55
NA,know of cases where people deliberately,55
NA,minimise their assessable taxable income to,55
NA,avoid their obligations to their children. It,55
NA,"was recently reported that more than 35,000",55
NA,"divorced parents, mainly fathers, have been",55
NA,forced to pay $13 million in a major tax of-,55
NA,fice crackdown on parents who do not file,55
NA,their tax returns in order to avoid paying,55
NA,their legal child support obligations.,55
NA,Senator Ellison recently commented that,55
NA,this new program was expected to net some,55
NA,$460 million in child support payments over,55
NA,the next four years. We certainly hope that,55
NA,"occurs, because there have been many sole",55
NA,parent families left in the lurch by people,55
NA,deliberately falsifying or minimising their,55
NA,assessable taxable income to avoid their ob-,55
NA,ligations of financial contribution to raising,55
NA,their children.,55
NA,From July next year we will see the final,55
NA,stage of the long-awaited changes to the,55
NA,formula for calculating child support-a new,55
NA,formula that will form the basis for the cal-,55
NA,culation of child support. For the first time,55
NA,diwe will have a formula which will be based,55
NA,on our own Australian research and provide a,55
NA,more objective and realistic assessment of,55
NA,the actual costs of raising children. The for-,55
NA,commula will treat the incomes and living costs,55
NA,of both parents more equitably and take into,55
NA,account the fact that older children cost more,56
NA,to raise. It will also ensure that children,56
NA,first and second families are treated more,56
NA,equitably. That has been a major cause of,56
NA,complaint from constituents who ask me,56
NA,why children of subsequent partnering and,56
NA,marriage are treated less favourably than,56
NA,children from the first marriage.,56
NA,These changes will see parents share in,56
NA,the cost of supporting their children accord-,56
NA,ing to their capacity to pay. The new propos-,56
NA,als and the new formula move away from the,56
NA,principle that the existing formula is based,56
NA,"on-that is, the principle of continuity of",56
NA,"expenditure, which somehow tries to artifi-",56
NA,cially maintain the intact family standard of,56
NA,living post separation. Something that has,56
NA,always baffled me and I have found hard to,56
NA,explain to my constituents is the basis of the,56
NA,percentages in the current formula and how,56
NA,they apply in a fair way. I think that for the,56
NA,"first time, in moving towards an income-",56
NA,"sharing approach, we will have a far more",56
NA,objective and scientific basis on which to,56
NA,respond to those issues. I think the new for-,56
NA,mula will better reflect the principle of,56
NA,shared parental responsibility and better re-,56
NA,flect the changes in workforce participation,56
NA,by women. It is proposed that in future the,56
NA,cost of raising children will be based on the,56
NA,"parents' combined income, with the costs",56
NA,distributed between the mother and the fa-,56
NA,"ther, or the resident and non-resident parent,",56
NA,in accordance with their respective share of,56
NA,that combined income and their level of con-,56
NA,tact with their children. Both parents will,56
NA,now have a component for their self-support,56
NA,deducted from the income table.,56
NA,"Very importantly, in moving away from",56
NA,the arbitrary percentages that we have had,56
NA,"applied in the past, we will for the first time,",56
NA,courtesy of the fantastic work done by the,56
NA,University of Canberra's National Centre for,56
NA,"Social and Economic Modelling, have a",56
NA,much more objective and realistic assess-,56
NA,ment of the actual cost of raising children. As,56
NA,"from NATSEM themselves argue, the calculations",56
NA,can never be perfect; but they will be as,56
NA,close as researchers believe it is possible to,56
NA,"be. For example, they have estimated that for",56
NA,a single child up to the age of four the aver-,56
NA,age cost of care is $91 per week in a two-,56
NA,parent family and $115 per week in a single-,56
NA,"parent family. For a fiveto 12-year old, the",56
NA,cost rose to $95 per week in a two-income,56
NA,family and $119 per week in a single-parent,56
NA,family. I give those examples to make the,56
NA,point that it will be much easier to address,56
NA,the constant complaints and concerns when,56
NA,you can say to people who come to see you,56
NA,"that at least, for the first time, we have the",56
NA,best calculations possible as to the actual,56
NA,cost of raising children today.,56
NA,Some people have argued with me that,56
NA,high-income earners appear to be favoured,56
NA,and advantaged by these changes and asked,56
NA,me whether I think that is fair. I guess that is,56
NA,a judgement people will come to in regard to,56
NA,"their individual assessments, but I would",56
NA,note that a non-resident parent supporting,56
NA,two children under the age of 12 would still,56
NA,be making payments in the order of $472 per,56
NA,week at the top end and that those payments,56
NA,are in fact higher than the objective data that,56
NA,NATSEM has produced on the cost of raising,56
NA,"children. So, even though initially it might",56
NA,appear that it skews the advantage to high-,56
NA,"income earners, when you look at the reduc-",56
NA,tion in the cap against the actual costs I think,56
NA,you see that there is a measure of fairness in,56
NA,"it. As I indicated earlier, the task force rec-",56
NA,ommended an increase in the self-support,56
NA,"amount, that it should be the same for both",56
NA,parents and that children from first and sec-,56
NA,ond families and partnerships ought to be,56
NA,treated as equally as possible. The formula,56
NA,also recognises that regular face-to-face con-,56
NA,tact is an important component in assessing,56
NA,child support payments.,56
NA,I have some concerns about the with-,57
NA,drawal rate for child support liability. It has,57
NA,"been suggested that regular contact-that is,",57
NA,contact of at least five nights per fortnight-,57
NA,should entitle the non-resident parent to a 24,57
NA,per cent reduction in their child support li-,57
NA,ability. I would urge the government to re-,57
NA,view that before the changes are introduced,57
NA,because I do feel that that rate of reduction is,57
NA,"too high and, in fact, could have the unin-",57
NA,tended consequence of leaving too many sole,57
NA,parents-usually resident mums-in a more,57
NA,vulnerable position than they are in today. I,57
NA,think if we could revisit that 24 per cent re-,57
NA,duction for the non-resident parent who has,57
NA,the child or children for at least five nights a,57
NA,"fortnight, we might get to a better and fairer",57
NA,outcome and address some of the very im-,57
NA,portant issues that the member for Jagajaga,57
NA,raised in her contribution. We still have time,57
NA,to do that before the final legislative changes,57
NA,are enacted.,57
NA,I would like to talk about one example,57
NA,from evidence given to a Senate committee,57
NA,recently by Jaqueline Taylor from the Na-,57
NA,tional Council of Single Mothers and their,57
NA,Children. She said:,57
NA,... calculating the financial impact on single,57
NA,mother families post July next year has actually,57
NA,been an incredibly difficult thing to do because,57
NA,there is nothing available to help us with that.,57
NA,There has been no modelling done by the gov-,57
NA,ernment to actually calculate the impact that,57
NA,changes will have on sole parent families and we,57
NA,cannot forget that this is also in conjunction with,57
NA,Welfare to Work and the loss of income from that.,57
NA,"So it would be a great tragedy, in my view, if",57
NA,all the positive and innovative changes that,57
NA,recognise the anomalies and the difficulties,57
NA,inherent in the current formula were to falter,57
NA,"on the rock of leaving some people, pre-",57
NA,"dominantly sole parent mums, in a more pre-",57
NA,carious and vulnerable position than they are,57
NA,now in. It is important for the government to,57
NA,ensure that the overall package is correlated,57
NA,very closely and carefully with welfare poli-,57
NA,cies and benefits to ensure that low-income,57
NA,households raising children are not left,57
NA,worse off than they are presently. I think it,57
NA,would be a terrible shame were child poverty,57
NA,levels to rise as an unintended consequence,57
NA,of the positive changes recommended by the,57
NA,Parkinson report. I am very pleased that I,57
NA,had the opportunity to participate in the re-,57
NA,view. I am very proud of the report we pre-,57
NA,sented and I am very encouraged by the leg-,57
NA,islative changes that will shake up the family,57
NA,law system and child support in this country.,57
Mr HARDGRAVE ,Moreton) (11.59,57
NA,am)-Before turning to the provisions of the,57
NA,"Families, Community Services and Indige-",57
NA,nous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child,57
NA,Support Reform Consolidation and Other,57
NA,"Measures) Bill 2007, I wish to delay the",57
NA,House for a moment to congratulate the,57
NA,member for Throsby on her very carefully,57
NA,considered observations. I find virtually no,57
NA,fault with anything she has just said. I could,57
NA,"leave my remarks there, to the relief of eve-",57
NA,"ryone, and take my seat, but I shall not. I",57
NA,would like to contribute to the discussion.,57
NA,"The member for Throsby has, to my mind,",57
NA,outlined some very real circumstances. I am,57
NA,"optimistic that Minister Brough, because of",57
NA,"his great capacity to listen, will look very",57
NA,closely at what the member for Throsby has,57
NA,"just said about single parents, and particu-",57
NA,"these larly single mothers, who may feel a sense of",57
NA,vulnerability. We in our various electorate,57
NA,offices see that every day. I am optimistic,57
NA,that Minister Brough will look very closely,57
NA,at what the member for Throsby said. I am,57
NA,certain that over the next 12 months he will,57
NA,ensure that by 1 July next year we have some,57
NA,of those matters put to rest.,57
NA,It is absolutely important in this debate,57
NA,that we drive out any sense of victimhood.,57
NA,The member for Throsby is right to say that,57
NA,"the minimum $5, now $6, contribution is not",57
NA,enough. That $5 contribution was not in,57
NA,place until the last decade-that minimum,58
NA,"expectation of people, say, on a pension or",58
NA,benefit to make a contribution towards the,58
NA,raising of the child in the custody of the,58
NA,other parent. I do not think that $5 is any-,58
NA,where near enough. I do not want to see $6. I,58
NA,want to see $25. That might be a mark in the,58
NA,sand that I do not mind putting on the table.,58
NA,Nothing annoys me more as a local mem-,58
NA,ber than to hear the stories of a delinquent,58
NA,"and absent parent who does not even bother,",58
NA,"who does not even try, to contribute any",58
NA,money towards the upkeep of their child.,58
NA,Recently I had in my office the case of a,58
NA,"young woman with an ex-partner who, be-",58
NA,cause of the way the family law system,58
NA,"works, has to have a phone number for ac-",58
NA,cess and who uses that phone number to ring,58
NA,her and abuse her. He screams at her over the,58
NA,phone.,58
NA,"In saying that, I do not want to typecast",58
NA,the blokes as always being at fault. That is,58
NA,often not the case. There are circumstances,58
NA,"like those of another case I had, in which a",58
NA,"man and a woman's relationship broke down,",58
NA,which I am sure everyone would see as an,58
NA,absolute tragedy. They had a child between,58
NA,them. They had reached agreement on a sen-,58
NA,"sible parenting plan, as they were encour-",58
NA,"aged to do, where essentially the wage struc-",58
NA,tures of both were the same. Even though,58
NA,one cashed out part of their wage to receive,58
NA,"car from a state government department, ba-",58
NA,sically their incomes were exactly the same.,58
NA,They had one child between them and they,58
NA,had reached agreement on a parenting plan,58
NA,of 50 per cent each looking after the child.,58
NA,The child had access to both parents. But the,58
NA,woman involved-and good luck to her-,58
NA,found another man and got married. She rang,58
NA,her former husband and said: ‘I have to,58
NA,change the arrangements now. I am pregnant,58
NA,"with another child, so I am going to retire",58
NA,from work and you are going to pay for me,58
NA,to have the baby.' This was because of the,58
NA,way the system used to operate. He was now,58
NA,culpable because he was going to be the in-,58
NA,come earner. Under the way the system had,58
NA,"operated in the past, he was the person who",58
NA,basically paid for his former wife to have a,58
NA,baby with someone else.,58
NA,That is one of the reasons why there are,58
NA,people in my electorate who are just hanging,58
NA,"on for the changes, which the member for",58
NA,"Throsby and others no doubt will outline, at",58
NA,"the start of next year, where we will see the",58
NA,more equitable treatment of both parents',58
NA,incomes being taken into account. We will,58
NA,see a further decline in the situation where,58
NA,people use child support as a form of re-,58
NA,venge on the previous partner. They use it as,58
NA,a means of financially beating up or control-,58
NA,ling that person. So I applaud Minister,58
NA,Brough for the continuation of his efforts. I,58
NA,saw the Minister for Defence here a moment,58
NA,ago-he has other duties. As the supreme,58
NA,commander of the south-west Pacific he has,58
NA,"many duties, no doubt. When we came to",58
NA,office in 1996 we inherited this system of,58
NA,"child support, which was more fledgling than",58
NA,it is today and needed a lot of work. A num-,58
NA,ber of us worked with then Minister Jocelyn,58
NA,Newman to effect some changes. It has taken,58
NA,a long time to drive them along. I remember,58
NA,that the member for Chifley in the previous,58
NA,Keating government chaired an inquiry into,58
NA,"a this, saying: ‘Mate, don't let it slip. You've",58
NA,got to ensure that there is better treatment of,58
NA,"this, that we see both parents' incomes being",58
NA,counted.',58
NA,In hammering this point I am probably ru-,58
NA,"ining your career, Member for Throsby, but I",58
NA,am saying that I think your contribution to-,58
NA,day was very good and I think it shows that,58
NA,there is some real concern and effort on both,58
NA,sides of the chamber on this matter. What we,58
NA,"want to see, ideally, is families staying intact,",58
NA,"but we accept that that is, unfortunately, not",58
NA,always the case. The children must come,58
NA,first in these circumstances. The welfare of,58
NA,the child must be paramount. I am also look-,59
NA,ing forward to work being done to remove,59
NA,this formula and to perhaps individualise,59
NA,better the circumstances and the costs of rais-,59
NA,"ing children. As the parent of two teenagers,",59
NA,I know that they are far more expensive than,59
NA,when they were young kids. So I am very,59
NA,"pleased with, and enormously proud of, the",59
NA,work this government has been doing in this,59
NA,important area.,59
NA,But this bill is not just about child support,59
NA,reform. It contains a number of other meas-,59
NA,ures. We have spent a bit of time this morn-,59
NA,ing talking about child support matters be-,59
NA,"cause they are important, but the other meas-",59
NA,ures are equally important. The bill deals,59
NA,with social security and veterans matters. It,59
NA,amends the veterans' entitlements legislation,59
NA,in regard to the sale of a principal home.,59
NA,These homes have been asset tax exempt if,59
NA,the person is likely to use the proceeds to,59
NA,buy another home. The previous provisions,59
NA,have applied within 12 months. We have,59
NA,"listened, and we have recognised what is",59
NA,going on in the real world. It takes a bit,59
NA,longer for many people to build a home than,59
NA,maybe that 12-month period. They have to,59
NA,find another place to put that money and they,59
NA,do not see it as an unspent asset sitting in the,59
NA,"bank. To give people 24 months, not 12",59
NA,"months, is one of the measures in this bill.",59
NA,"Equally, the bill makes amendments relating",59
NA,to income streams. A number of minor,59
NA,amendments are aimed at enhancing and im-,59
NA,proving the efficacy and the efficiency of,59
NA,various income-stream rules.,59
NA,The bill also makes changes to the pay-,59
NA,ment of the baby bonus. A few older people,59
NA,in my electorate have made their complaints,59
NA,obvious to me about the way in which the,59
NA,government has been making payments of,59
NA,"the baby bonus, the $4,000-‘One for you,",59
NA,"one for your wife and one for the country,'",59
NA,said the Treasurer. Many people have been,59
NA,taking up the baby bonus. It does not meet,59
NA,the full cost of a child coming into the world.,59
NA,It is about encouraging people on the mar-,59
NA,gins in their decision to have a baby. If it is a,59
NA,financial reason that is stopping them-that,59
NA,"is, if you can make these decisions and get",59
NA,"the timing right-this $4,000 baby bonus",59
NA,helps people through that.,59
NA,There has been genuine concern about,59
NA,"many single parents, and I know that the",59
NA,"Minister for Families, Community Services",59
NA,and Indigenous Affairs has made it plain that,59
NA,in some Indigenous communities there have,59
NA,been real ramifications for young women in,59
NA,this regard. For under 18-year-olds we are,59
NA,now going to put in place a formal system of,59
NA,instalments. We are going to pay the baby,59
NA,"bonus in 13 fortnightly instalments, require",59
NA,the registration of the birth by the relevant,59
NA,state or territory authority as a condition of,59
NA,eligibility and rename the maternity payment,59
NA,the ‘baby bonus'. The concept is very plain.,59
NA,It is about not allowing any sets of circum-,59
NA,stances whereby people see a profit out of,59
NA,pregnancy but realising that it is about assist-,59
NA,ing the creation of a nurturing environment,59
NA,for the child.,59
NA,I know there will be a lot of older people,59
NA,in my electorate who will say: ‘In our day we,59
NA,never received this assistance from govern-,59
NA,ment. Why are you doing it now?' Fertility,59
NA,"rates have declined, our population is going",59
NA,to decline and our standard of living is going,59
NA,to decline over the next 20 or 30 years if we,59
NA,do not keep our population growing in a,59
NA,positive way so that we have productive,59
NA,members of our community able to earn a,59
NA,wage and pay the taxes and create the indus-,59
NA,tries and all of the things that people of past,59
NA,generations have done. We are the only,59
NA,"country, as I understand it, in the Western",59
NA,world that has turned around its birth rate,59
NA,"and, in fact, has increased its birth rate. That",59
NA,may be due to the fact that we have identi-,59
NA,fied ways to assist people on the margins,59
NA,look at the financial aspect when making the,59
NA,decision to have a family. The situation is,60
NA,very positive in that regard.,60
NA,Looking at the portability of family tax,60
NA,"benefit, changes have been made to allow a",60
NA,portability period of 13 weeks for full pay-,60
NA,ment. That is now being extended to mem-,60
NA,bers of the Australian Defence Force and,60
NA,certain Australian Federal Police personnel,60
NA,of the International Deployment Group.,60
NA,When they are deployed overseas as part of,60
NA,"their duty and, in fact, remain overseas for",60
NA,"longer than 13 weeks, we do not want to see",60
NA,them losing that family payment. We are,60
NA,tidying up in that respect. With Australia,60
NA,now involved in 10 deployments-we have,60
NA,never had a greater number of deployments,60
NA,overseas in our entire history-there are,60
NA,many thousands of great Australians serving,60
NA,our country in uniform in all sorts of places,60
NA,who do not deserve the impost of a system,60
NA,denying them access to family tax benefits.,60
NA,"Therefore, I am pleased to support this",60
NA,measure. When I was in the Middle East a,60
NA,couple of weeks ago with the men and,60
NA,women of the HMAS Toowoomba and the,60
NA,men and women of the RAAF who were on,60
NA,flying missions in various parts in support,60
NA,our effort to ensure Iraq remains free and,60
NA,gains the strength in its economy which will,60
NA,"underpin its democracy, there were many",60
NA,people there who have families in Australia,60
NA,who will be advantaged by the efforts the,60
NA,government is introducing in this legislation.,60
NA,We are also amending the maintenance in-,60
NA,come test provisions in the A New Tax Sys-,60
NA,tem (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and clari-,60
NA,fying the meaning of the words ‘amount re-,60
NA,ceived' and ‘amount payable'. These techni-,60
NA,cal amendments clarify that maintenance,60
NA,income received by a payee for one or more,60
NA,children would reduce the payee's amount of,60
NA,family tax benefit A above the base rate for,60
NA,those children only. Such technical amend-,60
NA,ments may seem to delay the parliament,60
NA,from time to time but they have a critical,60
NA,public face and a highly personal reach each,60
NA,and every time we deal with these matters.,60
NA,The government's announcement in yes-,60
NA,terday's budget to deliver more for Austra-,60
NA,lian families-an additional $4.5 billion,60
NA,committed over five years-will support,60
NA,"families and children, people with disabili-",60
NA,"ties, volunteers, Indigenous and older Austra-",60
NA,lians. We are seeing the expenditure of $50.6,60
NA,billion a year across the portfolio adminis-,60
NA,tered by Minister Brough and Minister Scul-,60
NA,lion. The enormous $2.1 billion childcare,60
NA,investment that was announced will see,60
NA,some very positive changes to the payment,60
NA,"of the childcare tax rebate, which can now be",60
NA,brought forward and paid soon after the end,60
NA,of the financial year in which costs are in-,60
NA,"curred, at a cost of some $1.4 billion over",60
NA,four years. This measure provides a very real,60
NA,dividend for people in my electorate where,60
NA,we have great childcare services and many,60
NA,people paying lots of money to them. We are,60
NA,now in a position to ensure that my constitu-,60
NA,"ents, and yours as well, Mr Deputy Speaker,",60
NA,"are able to access more money-in fact, up",60
NA,"to $8,000-over the next few months, de-",60
NA,"of pending on their circumstances, to assist",60
NA,them in meeting the costs of child care. All,60
NA,of these massive amounts that are being ex-,60
NA,pended by the government on behalf of the,60
NA,people of Australia require the careful ad-,60
NA,ministration that this government has,60
NA,brought to the task. The legislation before us,60
NA,has an even greater reach today than it would,60
NA,have had a week ago because of this major,60
NA,amount of additional assistance that the gov-,60
NA,"ernment is giving child care, child support",60
NA,"and family assistance-growing the cake,",60
NA,"growing the circumstances, growing the",60
NA,sense of support that can be offered.,60
NA,The contrast will become very evident,60
NA,when we start to see the semblance of an,60
NA,address-in-reply and a contribution by those,60
NA,opposite. The challenge to those opposite in,60
NA,the course of this debate-to follow the ex-,60
NA,"ample of the member for Throsby, for one-",61
NA,is to not send to vulnerable people in the,61
NA,community the signal of victimisation being,61
NA,their way of life. In the whole area of family,61
NA,"support, child care and indeed child support",61
NA,it is absolutely important that we encourage,61
NA,those people with a capacity to do for them-,61
NA,selves to do so. The more we liberate people,61
NA,with the ability to do something for them-,61
NA,"selves first and foremost, and back those",61
NA,"people, the more we can concentrate our ef-",61
NA,forts on those with no capacity to assist,61
NA,themselves. That is the simple difference,61
NA,between this side of the House and those,61
NA,"opposite, who pretend they want to be in",61
NA,government later in the year and have no,61
NA,"manifesto, no policies, no certainty-we",61
NA,would simply see a return to the way it used,61
NA,to be. One of the things that are very clear in,61
NA,"any discussion about child support, as the",61
NA,"member for Throsby suggested, is the fact",61
NA,that many families now have the challenge of,61
NA,"balancing welfare to work, where many peo-",61
NA,ple on the margins are being encouraged-,61
NA,some might say ‘coerced'-to do for them-,61
NA,selves first and foremost and not to wait for,61
NA,others to do it for them.,61
NA,People are making decisions on the mar-,61
NA,"gins, putting their children through profes-",61
NA,sional child care and giving them nurturing,61
NA,and an educative environment in formative,61
NA,"years, using child care while they go off to",61
NA,earn a living. People are under a certain,61
NA,amount of pressure and expectation that they,61
NA,are going to help pay their way first and,61
NA,foremost. That is a big difference from those,61
NA,opposite who had a view which said to peo-,61
NA,"ple: ‘You're never going to achieve anything,",61
NA,you're never going to get anywhere. Park,61
NA,"yourself in welfare. Not only that, we'll find",61
NA,new ways to park you in various aspects of,61
NA,welfare. We'll increase the ability of people,61
NA,to access disability pensions and we'll hide,61
NA,unemployment by making more people tech-,61
NA,nically disabled for the purposes of welfare,61
NA,but not disabled in reality.' They were more,61
NA,consumed with ensuring there were more,61
NA,"victims in society, the theory being that, if",61
NA,"there are more victims, more people are go-",61
NA,ing to vote Labor.,61
NA,"On this side, we have challenged people to",61
NA,get off their tail and go and do for them-,61
NA,selves. We have backed those who want to,61
NA,back themselves. The work we are doing,61
NA,through this legislation continues that jour-,61
NA,ney and last night's budget announcements,61
NA,enhance that very much so. People who are,61
NA,prepared to do for themselves are going to,61
NA,get great support from this government.,61
NA,Whether it is child support-where the,61
NA,"journey continues, with the efforts of the past",61
NA,decade now producing fruit and the promise,61
NA,of what will come over the years ahead-,61
NA,income streams or asset test exemption peri-,61
NA,"ods, we are saying to people, ‘If you want to",61
NA,"work hard, to achieve something for your-",61
NA,"selves, to make a difference in our society",61
NA,"and grow our economy along the way, we",61
NA,want to back you all the way.' I congratulate,61
NA,Minister Brough on the success he managed,61
NA,to achieve for the people of Australia who,61
NA,"rely on him, with $50 billion plus annual",61
NA,expenditure through his portfolio secured by,61
NA,last night's budget announcements. I con-,61
NA,gratulate him and officers of his department,61
NA,on the close work they do to deliver the,61
NA,kinds of technical amendments we have be-,61
NA,fore us today.,61
NA,"Finally, I will end on a very special vote",61
NA,of thanks to members of the Child Support,61
NA,Agency-we have spent a bit of time talking,61
NA,about them. Today they are dealing with a set,61
NA,of circumstances which are different from a,61
NA,decade ago. I think they are now a lot more,61
NA,responsive than a decade ago to the ambi-,61
NA,tions of blokes when they get on the phone.,61
NA,"When first elected in 1996, I heard com-",61
NA,plaints time and time again about officers of,61
NA,the Child Support Agency assuming that the,61
NA,blokes were at fault-no offence to officers,62
NA,but this is what people were saying to me.,62
NA,"Now with more men involved in the process,",62
NA,that kind of discussion is defeated because,62
NA,there is an opportunity for greater action,62
NA,across genders and a greater sense of respect,62
NA,all round. We have moved things along,62
NA,enormously over the last decade but there is,62
NA,"much more work to do, which is certainly",62
NA,part of the reason we cannot go back to what,62
NA,"we had pre 1996, to a government that is",62
NA,philosophically underpinned by the creation,62
NA,"of more victims, telling people why they",62
NA,cannot do something instead of encouraging,62
NA,them to do things for themselves. That is the,62
NA,philosophical difference between the Labor,62
NA,"Party and the government, between the coali-",62
NA,tion and those who start from the position,62
NA,that people are going to fail. I commend this,62
NA,bill to the House and encourage others to,62
NA,follow the example of the member for,62
NA,Throsby in her very good contribution earlier,62
NA,today.,62
Ms PLIBERSEK ,Sydney) (12.18 pm)-,62
NA,"The Families, Community Services and In-",62
NA,digenous Affairs Legislation Amendment,62
NA,(Child Support Reform Consolidation and,62
NA,Other Measures) Bill 2007 is the third in a,62
NA,series of child support legislative reforms.,62
NA,represents the final part of the government's,62
NA,2006 reforms to the child support system.,62
NA,Labor have largely supported these reforms,62
NA,and as a result we support this bill. In the,62
NA,"debates on the previous two bills, however,",62
NA,we have expressed our concerns that the,62
NA,government has failed to protect low-income,62
NA,families who may lose income as a result of,62
NA,the changes to the Child Support Scheme. In,62
NA,"speaking today on this bill, I note that our",62
NA,concerns have still not been adequately ad-,62
NA,dressed by the government.,62
NA,The Child Support Scheme was set up in,62
NA,1988 by the Hawke Labor government and,62
NA,has become a model for other governments,62
NA,"around the world. The principle that, after",62
NA,"divorce, parents should continue to support",62
NA,"their children is very sound. However, over",62
NA,"the last five years a number of organisations,",62
NA,"academics, experts, members of this House",62
NA,and others have expressed genuine concerns,62
NA,about the scheme. The scheme has not al-,62
NA,ways operated fairly and equitably. The as-,62
NA,sessment formula has not always produced,62
NA,good outcomes. There were particular issues,62
NA,"with collection, arrears and compliance. It",62
NA,has not always been easy to get the money,62
NA,owed by non-custodial parents for the care of,62
NA,their children.,62
NA,Labor have acknowledged the need for re-,62
NA,form to the system but say that reform,62
NA,should not come at a cost for the poorest and,62
NA,"most vulnerable people, in particular the 1.1",62
NA,million children affected by child support,62
NA,and non-custodial parents who are often liv-,62
NA,"ing in poverty in this country. In fact, custo-",62
NA,dial parents and their children are often,62
NA,among the poorest groups in our community.,62
NA,They are very vulnerable to changes which,62
NA,affect their income and we are very con-,62
NA,cerned that any changes in this area will not,62
NA,drive custodial parents and their children into,62
NA,poverty.,62
NA,The reform process has been lengthy. In,62
NA,It 2003 the House of Representatives Standing,62
NA,Committee on Family and Community Af-,62
NA,fairs tabled its report Every picture tells a,62
NA,story: inquiry into child custody arrange-,62
NA,ments in the event of family separation. The,62
NA,report dealt with child support and other,62
NA,family separation issues and made 29 bipar-,62
NA,tisan recommendations. Among its recom-,62
NA,mendations was the establishment of a min-,62
NA,isterial task force to evaluate the Child Sup-,62
NA,"port Scheme, including establishing the costs",62
NA,of children's upbringing after parental sepa-,62
NA,"ration, recognising different income levels of",62
NA,households and reflecting the costs for both,62
NA,parents of maintaining meaningful contact,62
NA,with their children.,62
NA,"In May 2005, the report of the Ministerial",63
NA,"Taskforce on Child Support, known as the",63
NA,"Parkinson report, provided the first system-",63
NA,atic evaluation of the child support arrange-,63
NA,ments. It undertook a comprehensive analy-,63
NA,"sis, relying on international research and",63
NA,commissioning modelling to come up with,63
NA,the best possible statistical information on,63
NA,the costs of children. It recommended an,63
NA,overhaul of the formula underlying the child,63
NA,support system that was based on evidence,63
NA,"of the actual costs of raising children,",63
NA,parental responsibility for those costs and,63
NA,recognition of each parent's level of care.,63
NA,"Last year, we debated and passed two bills",63
NA,which enacted many of the recommendations,63
NA,of the Parkinson report. Those two bills im-,63
NA,"plemented a new Child Support Scheme,",63
NA,"including a new payment formula, changing",63
NA,"the ‘capacity to earn' provisions, increasing",63
NA,the minimum payment and its indexation to,63
NA,"the consumer price index, and increasing the",63
NA,amount of child support payment that the,63
NA,non-resident parent can direct to specific,63
NA,purposes.,63
NA,"Certainly, not all of the recommendations",63
NA,of the Parkinson report were adopted. Cer-,63
NA,"tainly, the measures in those two earlier",63
NA,"were not entirely to Labor's satisfaction, and",63
NA,I have made a number of criticisms in the,63
NA,past about aspects of that legislation. The,63
NA,principal concern raised by the reforms-and,63
NA,this remains my principal concern-is the,63
NA,effect of the new assessment formula on low-,63
NA,"income resident parents, particularly those",63
NA,who have children under the age of 12. In all,63
NA,"of these debates, we have tried to take a con-",63
NA,structive approach to the reforms. It is not,63
NA,"my intention, and it is certainly not Labor's",63
NA,"intention, to politicise child support. We",63
NA,knowledge that it is a very difficult area to,63
NA,"get right. However, I remain concerned, and",63
NA,"I know many of my colleagues do, about the",63
NA,interaction of taking money from low-,63
NA,"income resident parents, particularly those",63
NA,"with children under 12, at the same time as",63
NA,we are introducing Welfare to Work reforms,63
NA,and cutting the pay and conditions of the,63
NA,poorest and most vulnerable workers in this,63
NA,country. Those three things working together,63
NA,are set to penalise some of the poorest people,63
NA,in the country and those people who are busy,63
NA,raising the next generation. I am worried,63
NA,about that.,63
NA,Last week there was a Senate committee,63
NA,inquiry into the bill. The inquiry highlighted,63
NA,shared the concerns about low-income custodial,63
NA,parents. The report shows that a number of,63
NA,the deleterious effects have not been ad-,63
NA,dressed by the government. The department,63
NA,"responsible for child support policy, FaCSIA,",63
NA,gave evidence that the implementation of the,63
NA,reforms is not progressing as smoothly as we,63
NA,might hope. The department had agreed to,63
NA,establish a stakeholder reference group but,63
NA,that group apparently has met just once. The,63
NA,department has very little information about,63
NA,the impact of the new formula and new ar-,63
NA,rangements on families.,63
NA,In debates on the child support bills last,63
NA,"year, we called for transitional provisions in",63
NA,these bills to soften the blow for those low-,63
NA,bills income sole parent families. We certainly,63
NA,have not seen any of those transitional ar-,63
NA,rangements in this legislation. If we put the,63
NA,interests of children first and respect the,63
NA,"original intent of the Child Support Scheme,",63
NA,"which was to reduce child poverty, Labor",63
NA,would argue that there is a clear responsibil-,63
NA,ity on the part of the government to amelio-,63
NA,rate the negative effect of the changes on,63
NA,some of the poorest families in the country.,63
NA,"Today, again, we are debating these meas-",63
NA,"ures. Again, we call on the government to",63
NA,ac- look to those most vulnerable parents and,63
NA,children and ensure that they are not penal-,63
NA,"ised, particularly during this transitional pe-",63
NA,riod. I note that the ministerial task force in,63
NA,its report urged the same thing. The ministe-,64
NA,"rial task force, on page 261 of its report, said:",64
NA,... the Government may wish to give considera-,64
NA,tion to the position of those whose liability or,64
NA,entitlement will vary to a large extent as a result,64
NA,"of the recommendations, to avoid causing hard-",64
NA,ship in the short term.,64
NA,"Certainly, that has not happened. These con-",64
NA,cerns formed the basis of recommendation,64
NA,"25 of the Parkinson report, which said that",64
NA,the government needed to ‘comprensively,64
NA,consider the management of the transitional,64
NA,issues regarding the implementation of the,64
NA,"new formula'. Unfortunately, our pleas re-",64
NA,garding some of the poorest families have,64
NA,fallen on deaf ears. No provision has been,64
NA,"made to protect those families, particularly",64
NA,the ones on very low incomes. That is why,64
NA,we have moved a second reading amendment,64
NA,in this regard. These are the same families,64
NA,"who are, as I said, affected by Welfare to",64
NA,Work changes and the Work Choices legisla-,64
NA,tion. We will be watching very closely this,64
NA,interaction between the new child support,64
NA,"legislation, the Welfare to Work changes and",64
NA,Work Choices.,64
NA,I turn to some of the measures that I am,64
NA,very pleased to see in this legislation. Cur-,64
NA,"rently, ongoing child support can only be",64
NA,collected from employers if the payer is a,64
NA,wage or salary earner or they receive a Cen-,64
NA,trelink payment. This legislation will,64
NA,broaden the agency's power to issue notices,64
NA,requiring the deduction of child support and,64
NA,the forwarding of that deduction to the Child,64
NA,Support Agency to include cases where the,64
NA,payer is under contract for service arrange-,64
NA,ments that are effectively substituting for,64
NA,wages. We have heard a lot over recent years,64
NA,about the substantial increase in the number,64
NA,of employees who are employed as inde-,64
NA,pendent contractors even when they are em-,64
NA,ployed to all intents and purposes as an em-,64
NA,ployee. Extending the ability of the Child,64
NA,Support Agency to collect in those circum-,64
NA,stances is certainly a positive measure.,64
NA,I turn briefly to the change to the payment,64
NA,of the baby bonus to under-18s. I am pleased,64
NA,to see that the government is paying the baby,64
NA,bonus in 13 instalments to parents under the,64
NA,age of 18. I am sure there are responsible,64
NA,parents out there who are under the age of,64
NA,"18, but I fear that the temptation of a $4,000",64
NA,lump sum may be too much for some of,64
NA,them. I think it is a more certain thing to pay,64
NA,people over a number of fortnights in order,64
NA,to avoid some of the worst effects that we,64
NA,have heard about in the payment of the baby,64
NA,"bonus. Labor has said all along that, in cases",64
NA,where the money is likely not to be used in,64
NA,"the best interests of the children, this should",64
NA,be something that we consider.,64
NA,Labor supports the payment of the baby,64
NA,bonus generally as a good measure for help-,64
NA,ing parents when they encounter a lot of high,64
NA,costs around the time of the birth of the,64
NA,child. I am generally very sceptical when I,64
NA,hear stories about people living high on the,64
NA,hog on a few thousand dollars of government,64
NA,"support at the time of the birth of a child, but",64
NA,there have been too many stories of concern,64
NA,in this area for us to ignore them completely.,64
NA,The stories that were brought to my attention,64
NA,"in relation to under-18s and the baby bonus,",64
NA,or more generally younger parents and the,64
NA,"baby bonus, were not coming from the usual",64
NA,shock-jock sources; they were coming from,64
NA,"youth workers, grandparents and community",64
NA,health nurses-people who have everyday,64
NA,contact with young parents and who want to,64
NA,"support them, encourage them and teach",64
NA,them how to be good parents. They were not,64
NA,people who were interested in putting down,64
NA,young parents but people who were con-,64
NA,cerned that some of the money was not being,64
NA,spent in ways that were particularly useful,64
NA,for very young children. One woman told,64
NA,Today Tonight that her daughter was an ice,64
NA,addict who had seven children and that her,64
NA,"daughter had told her, the grandmother, that",65
NA,she had had more children just to get the,65
NA,"$4,000 baby bonus for each. On the same",65
NA,"program, a 19-year-old mother of three said",65
NA,she had had her children just to get the baby,65
NA,bonus. I do not think this is widespread. I do,65
NA,not think many people are doing it; I think,65
NA,we are talking about tiny numbers. But it,65
NA,breaks my heart to think that any child would,65
NA,be brought into the world for such a reason.,65
NA,It is easy to discount these reports because,65
NA,we hear them from sensationalist sources,65
NA,that are interested in beating them up be-,65
NA,cause they make good TV or are a good,65
NA,"story, but we also have people like Father",65
NA,"Chris Riley, who dedicates every day of his",65
NA,"life to helping and supporting young people,",65
NA,saying that this payment has been causing,65
NA,‘children to have children'. They are his,65
NA,words: ‘children to have children'. A West-,65
NA,ern Sydney youth service reported directly to,65
NA,"me that some of their clients saw the $4,000",65
NA,"as a good way to buy a car or, in one case, a",65
NA,purebred dog. A Tasmanian youth worker,65
NA,told me that he knew of young men who,65
NA,were convincing their girlfriends to become,65
NA,"pregnant, collecting the baby bonus when the",65
NA,baby was born and then shooting through.,65
NA,Sometimes they were not convincing their,65
NA,"girlfriends to become pregnant but, if they",65
NA,"became accidentally pregnant, were thinking,",65
NA,"‘Hang on a minute; I can get $4,000.' A",65
NA,Hawkesbury social worker told me of a,65
NA,young man who had systematically be-,65
NA,"friended lonely pregnant girls, waited until",65
NA,"they had given birth, convinced them to part",65
NA,with their baby bonus and then taken off. He,65
NA,boasted to this social worker that he had,65
NA,"done this five times, and he was working on",65
NA,his sixth victim when the social worker,65
NA,"chased him off. Again, I do not think we are",65
NA,"talking about thousands of cases, but the",65
NA,tragedy of every one of these cases means,65
NA,"that we need to take action, and Labor, as I",65
NA,"said, has been calling for action in this area",65
NA,for some time.,65
NA,Domestic violence services report that,65
NA,levels of abuse rise about six weeks after the,65
NA,"birth, just when the cheque comes in. Some",65
NA,women are handing over the money just to,65
NA,get rid of a violent partner. These are indi-,65
NA,"vidual stories, but we need to be aware,",65
NA,"when we make these sorts of payments, of",65
NA,"the social impact of the payments, even if",65
NA,that impact is on a small proportion of our,65
NA,population. I want to live in a society in,65
NA,which every child is wanted and every child,65
NA,"is loved, and in which parents are emotion-",65
NA,ally ready to cope with this lifelong com-,65
NA,"mitment, the most important job they can",65
NA,have.,65
NA,I understand that it is difficult to design a,65
NA,system that takes into account the lengths,65
NA,that poorly motivated people will go to. You,65
NA,cannot design a perfect system that is able to,65
NA,prevent the human will to do wrong if that is,65
NA,"a person's intention, but I think this is a posi-",65
NA,tive measure towards reducing this problem.,65
NA,"Certainly, I think that more broadly in situa-",65
NA,tions where children are at risk of neglect the,65
NA,baby bonus could be paid fortnightly so that,65
NA,it is more likely to be spent on bills and other,65
NA,child-rearing expenses. A lot of organisations,65
NA,are already dealing with parents whose chil-,65
NA,dren are at risk of abuse and neglect and I,65
NA,think we could do more in that area. Taking,65
NA,the ‘jackpot' effect out of this payment is,65
NA,something positive that may prevent children,65
NA,from being born into really damaging cir-,65
NA,"cumstances, so on that basis we support this",65
NA,change.,65
NA,I will finish by saying that it is important,65
NA,to remember that this payment was intro-,65
NA,duced with the purpose of increasing the,65
NA,birthrate. There has been a blip in the birth-,65
NA,"rate, mostly because the cohort of women",65
NA,"my age, who delayed childbearing because",65
NA,they were studying and getting a university,65
NA,"education and doing all the rest of it, is now",66
NA,having children. Has it had an effect?,66
NA,"Maybe. It is difficult to tell. We do know,",66
NA,"though, what does work when it comes to",66
NA,increasing the birthrate. If we look at coun-,66
NA,tries overseas with developed economies,66
NA,"which have higher birthrates, it is because",66
NA,they have good supports for families. They,66
NA,have paid maternity leave or paid parental,66
NA,"leave, they have better systems of child care",66
NA,than we have here and more affordable child,66
NA,"care, and they have workplaces that recog-",66
NA,nise that both parenting and paid work are,66
NA,essential roles. While of course Labor sup-,66
NA,"ports this payment for new parents, we think",66
NA,we really need to address those other areas of,66
NA,support for families if we are serious about,66
NA,increasing the birthrate in Australia.,66
Mr MELHAM ,Banks) (12.37 pm)-It is,66
NA,not my intention to go line by line through,66
NA,"what is a very technical bill. However, there",66
NA,are some broad remarks I wish to make in,66
NA,"relation to the Families, Community Services",66
NA,and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amend-,66
NA,ment (Child Support Reform Consolidation,66
NA,and Other Measures) Bill 2007. The issue of,66
NA,child support is one which affects every,66
NA,member of parliament. In my electorate of,66
NA,"Banks there are 2,465 persons who are liable",66
NA,"to pay child support, 2,488 persons who are",66
NA,eligible to receive child support and a total of,66
NA,"4,037 children for whom support should be",66
NA,paid.,66
NA,When I first entered this place 17 years,66
NA,"ago as a local member, the payment of child",66
NA,support was not an issue that my office dealt,66
NA,"with on a regular basis. Indeed, the legisla-",66
NA,"tion was not in place then. However, since",66
NA,"the legislation has been enacted, child sup-",66
NA,port is constantly being dealt with in my of-,66
NA,"fice-and, I am sure, in every member's of-",66
NA,fice. That is why the recent committee report,66
NA,"into child support and custody, which I will",66
NA,"come to later, came about. It is an issue that",66
NA,"the parliament has rightly confronted, legis-",66
NA,lated for and looked to improve and amend,66
NA,so as to give much deserved attention to,66
NA,community concerns.,66
NA,I want to focus on the broad context of the,66
NA,bill and the impact it will have on families.,66
NA,There is no doubt that the issue of child sup-,66
NA,port causes the most incredible heartache to,66
NA,parents and to children. This occurs follow-,66
NA,"ing, or as a part of, a relationship breakdown.",66
NA,"In itself, the relationship breakdown causes",66
NA,"significant distress to all the parties involved,",66
NA,and the issue of child support only multiplies,66
NA,the effect. Our constituents are usually in a,66
NA,state of grieving. As a local member I ac-,66
NA,knowledge that it is an extremely difficult,66
NA,issue to deal with in an equitable and fair,66
NA,manner. When they arrive at my office to,66
NA,"discuss a child support matter, I know that it",66
NA,will be emotional and almost impossible to,66
NA,resolve.,66
NA,"The original bill, the Child Support Legis-",66
NA,"lation Amendment Bill 2004, was intended to",66
NA,create a new system for the assessment of,66
NA,"child support payments. In the past, parents",66
NA,were quite reasonably concerned about the,66
NA,fact that the previous formula was based on,66
NA,percentages and that those percentages did,66
NA,not always relate to the actual cost of raising,66
NA,a child. The new system is based on an in-,66
NA,come share approach.,66
NA,We must acknowledge that this bill does,66
NA,little for low-income earners. The member,66
NA,for Jagajaga has moved a second reading,66
NA,amendment to that effect and I fully support,66
NA,that amendment. Too often this government,66
NA,proposes legislation that gives little consid-,66
NA,eration to the impact on those earning not,66
NA,"even middle-level incomes. Further, some",66
NA,"primary caregivers-usually, but not always,",66
NA,mothers-will actually have their payments,66
NA,reduced under this new bill. It is not always,66
NA,possible to fully compensate for the cost of,66
NA,raising children when the children are living,66
NA,in two separate homes-that of the primary,66
NA,caregiver and that of the access parent. Both,67
NA,the primary caregiver and the access parent,67
NA,incur real costs in raising their children.,67
NA,I note the concerns regarding proposed,67
NA,clause 64 of schedule 1 that were raised by,67
NA,the Law Council of Australia in their submis-,67
NA,sion to the Senate Standing Committee on,67
NA,Community Affairs. Their argument is that,67
NA,this clause leaves the determination of which,67
NA,documents are relevant and which docu-,67
NA,ments should be given to the court in the,67
NA,hands of the Social Security Administration,67
NA,Tribunal. The Law Council believe that the,67
NA,court should be entitled to review all docu-,67
NA,ments to determine which are relevant in a,67
NA,decision on a matter before it.,67
NA,"No legislation, however, can remove the",67
NA,impact of those who act in bad faith. As leg-,67
NA,islators our powers are limited in this regard.,67
NA,In reflecting on the remarks of my colleagues,67
NA,"during the debate on the original bill, I was",67
NA,struck by the note of caution in their words.,67
NA,We might have an acceptable formula to es-,67
NA,"tablish the costs of raising a child; however,",67
NA,no formula can determine the cost of the,67
NA,grief and the sense of injustice that many-,67
NA,"indeed, most-parents suffer while undergo-",67
NA,ing this process. With the best will in the,67
NA,"world we cannot legislate that away, unfor-",67
NA,tunately.,67
NA,I am reminded of a man who visited my,67
NA,office many years ago to discuss how unfair,67
NA,it was that he be expected to pay child sup-,67
NA,port for his child. He was working in a rea-,67
NA,sonably well-paid job at the time. He an-,67
NA,nounced to me that he intended changing,67
NA,jobs and deliberately taking a lower paying,67
NA,job so that his child support payments would,67
NA,"be reduced. Sadly, I believe that is not an",67
NA,uncommon practice amongst some members,67
NA,"of the community. It is a wrong practice, but",67
NA,it is out there. There is no way that we as a,67
NA,parliament can legislate around bad faith. We,67
NA,"can, however, ensure that the system in place",67
NA,is the most equitable it can be. As members,67
NA,of parliament there are ways we can work,67
NA,through issues which seem impossible. We,67
NA,can make a difference and we can offer the,67
NA,opportunity for members of the community,67
NA,to articulate their concerns. We can work,67
NA,with the community and try to understand,67
NA,"their concerns, even if we ourselves have not",67
NA,experienced similar circumstances.,67
NA,Constituents often ask what we do while,67
NA,we are in Canberra apart from debating legis-,67
NA,lation before the parliament. One of the most,67
NA,critical functions of a member of parliament,67
NA,is his or her participation in the committee,67
NA,process. This is a little understood yet vital,67
NA,part of the parliamentarian's day-to-day,67
NA,work. It is through the committee process,67
NA,that vital issues are identified and examined,67
NA,and the public are able to give input directly,67
NA,into the parliamentary process. Members of,67
NA,the public are able to provide written sub-,67
NA,missions and may then be invited to speak,67
NA,directly to committee members. This is true,67
NA,democracy in action. It is fundamental to the,67
NA,parliamentary process and to how we deal,67
NA,with important community issues.,67
NA,The reason I raise this matter is that the,67
NA,heart of the bill we are dealing with today,67
NA,"lies in a committee report. That report, Every",67
NA,picture tells a story: report on the inquiry,67
NA,into child custody arrangements in the event,67
NA,"of family separation, was produced by the",67
NA,House of Representatives Standing Commit-,67
NA,tee on Family and Community Affairs. It was,67
NA,published in 2003 and made a number of,67
NA,recommendations about child custody and,67
NA,child support. The fundamental premise of,67
NA,"that report, as stated in the terms of refer-",67
NA,"ence, was:",67
NA,(a) given that the best interests of the child are,67
NA,the paramount consideration ...,67
NA,This report involved thousands of hours of,67
NA,work and took as its operating premise that,67
NA,the best interests of the child are the para-,67
NA,mount consideration. This is how parliamen-,68
NA,tarians can deal with incredibly difficult and,68
NA,"emotive issues, this is how we work with and",68
NA,on behalf of the community and this is how,68
NA,we consider and work through those matters,68
NA,which are not black and white and involve,68
NA,many shades of grey. In her foreword to the,68
NA,"report, the chair, the member for Riverina,",68
NA,said :,68
NA,One of the highlights of committee work for,68
NA,liamentarians is the people we meet. During this,68
NA,inquiry our greatest delight was hearing from,68
NA,nine children and five young adults at our final,68
NA,meeting of the inquiry. These children and young,68
NA,adults were a microcosm of what this inquiry was,68
NA,all about.,68
NA,That report involved six months of work by,68
NA,not only the committee members but also the,68
NA,"committee staff. Over 2,000 people contrib-",68
NA,"uted to the inquiry through submissions, pre-",68
NA,senting evidence at hearings and participat-,68
NA,ing in committee visits to various family and,68
NA,mediation centres.,68
NA,This process is a core role of the parlia-,68
NA,ment. I do know that the members of the,68
NA,Standing Committee on Family and Com-,68
NA,munity Affairs were dedicated and commit-,68
NA,ted to an outcome that would ensure the,68
NA,rights of the children were the overriding,68
NA,factor in their considerations. The ultimate,68
NA,outcome of this report was a series of rec-,68
NA,ommendations that formed the basis for the,68
NA,"act that this bill is amending. As always, not",68
NA,everyone can be entirely satisfied with the,68
NA,"outcomes, but no-one can be in any doubt as",68
NA,to the effort put into trying to ensure that the,68
NA,outcome was the best for the children in-,68
NA,"volved. Most importantly, the result was bi-",68
NA,partisan. The committee chair noted in her,68
NA,foreword that initially there had been diver-,68
NA,gent views. She concluded:,68
NA,... I have never felt so proud of a group of,68
NA,bers of parliament who put political differences,68
NA,aside and worked together to ensure a united,68
NA,come.,68
NA,As a current member of several committees,68
NA,and a participant in the presentation of many,68
NA,"reports to the parliament, it seems to me that",68
NA,this is an achievement we may all be proud,68
NA,of. It is the bipartisan approach to resolving,68
NA,important public matters that makes the,68
NA,committee process so valuable. I am a great,68
NA,advocate of the committee process and I am,68
NA,concerned that the significance and impact of,68
NA,par- that process is being watered down. I note,68
NA,with some disquiet that this bill was referred,68
NA,the to the Senate Standing Committee on Com-,68
NA,munity Affairs on 29 March 2007 with a re-,68
NA,porting date of 8 May 2007. There was only,68
NA,one day of public hearings actually sched-,68
NA,uled. Given that we are debating the bill to-,68
NA,"day, it gives literally no time at all for those",68
NA,of us with an interest to consider the commit-,68
NA,tee's report.,68
NA,I have served on a number of committees,68
NA,in the 17 years I have been in this place. I,68
NA,believe in the committee process and that the,68
NA,executive should pay respect to the parlia-,68
NA,ment. Our committees should be functioning,68
NA,properly. The member for Chifley noted in a,68
NA,speech in this House on the tabling of a re-,68
NA,port from the Standing Committee on Proce-,68
NA,dure on 12 December 2005:,68
NA,If we want to continue to exist as an institu-,68
NA,"tion, if we want the parliament and parliamentari-",68
NA,"ans to be held in higher esteem by the public, one",68
NA,of the key ways we will succeed is through hav-,68
NA,ing a very vibrant and strong committee system.,68
NA,I think that is true. I think it is also true that,68
NA,one of the reasons we succeed and do as well,68
NA,as we have is that we also have a number of,68
NA,dedicated and professional public servants,68
NA,who advise the government and the execu-,68
NA,"tive of the day. Indeed, in the six years we",68
NA,were in government in the time that I have,68
NA,been here in parliament I was always im-,68
NA,mempressed with the quality of independent ad-,68
NA,vice that was provided by the Public Service,68
NA,outto each of the ministers that I had to deal,68
NA,with. I have no doubt that that has not,68
NA,changed over the years and that that profes-,69
NA,sional advice is still there in the public,69
NA,tor. We as a parliament need to recognise,69
NA,that. We need to nurture it and we need to,69
NA,"encourage that independent debate because,",69
NA,"quite frankly, if the politicians were half as",69
NA,good as the public servants and the public,69
NA,servants who serve on the committees then,69
NA,we would be a lot better off. The problem,69
NA,that we have had in the past at times is that,69
NA,some of the politicians tend to think that they,69
NA,are a little bit better than they are and every-,69
NA,one else has got to clean up the damage that,69
NA,they do-they do not intentionally do it-,69
NA,with the egos that they have. I commend the,69
NA,amending bill before the House to the par-,69
NA,liament. I also commend the amendment,69
NA,moved by the shadow minister for families,69
NA,"and community services, the member for",69
NA,"Jagajaga, to the House.",69
Mr HUNT ,Flinders-Parliamentary Sec-,69

NA,"digenous Affairs to speak on the Families,",69
NA,Community Services and Indigenous Affairs,69
NA,Legislation Amendment (Child Support Re-,69
NA,form Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill,69
NA,2007. The purpose of this follow-up bill is to,69
NA,complete consequential amendments and,69
NA,make minor refinements needed for the im-,69
NA,plementation of the new child support for-,69
NA,mula on 1 July 2008. The bill consolidates,69
NA,the government's substantial 2006 legislation,69
NA,that restructured the Child Support Scheme,69
NA,in line with the recommendations of the min-,69
NA,isterial task force on child support chaired by,69
NA,Professor Patrick Parkinson.,69
NA,The bill makes a variety of other amend-,69
NA,"ments to Families, Community Services and",69
NA,Indigenous Affairs portfolio legislation. This,69
NA,bill makes refinements to the major 2006,69
NA,child support legislation. A more fair treat-,69
NA,ment of child support will be made where,69
NA,there are children of different ages in differ-,69
NA,ent households. Child support agreements,69
NA,sec- between parents are being better supported,69
NA,and strengthened and their interaction with,69
NA,family tax benefit clarified. Remote area al-,69
NA,lowance under the social security and vet-,69
NA,eran's entitlement legislation is being ex-,69
NA,"tended, so parents with regular care of a",69
NA,"child-that is, care of between 14 and 35 per",69
NA,cent-will continue to receive the allowance,69
NA,after the 1 July 2008 changes to family tax,69
NA,benefit.,69
NA,Some of the processes relating to the re-,69
NA,view of child support decisions by the Social,69
NA,Security Appeals Tribunal are being clarified,69
NA,and the changed arrangements with the,69
NA,courts refined. The bill relocates some provi-,69
NA,sions from the Child Support Legislation,69
NA,Amendment Bill 2004. While that bill has,69
NA,been overtaken by the reform of the Child,69
NA,"Support Scheme, some measures are still",69
NA,required. The provisions move measures,69
NA,from the regulations into the primary child,69
NA,"support legislation, allowing Australia to",69
NA,meet its international child support obliga-,69
NA,tions. Some refinements are also being made,69
NA,to the provisions after years of experience of,69
NA,their operation.,69
NA,The 2004 bill measures include several,69
NA,amendments to improve equity between the,69
NA,two parties to a child support case in access-,69
NA,ing the court for review of any decision,69
NA,about whether one of the parties is a parent,69
NA,of the child in question. Some minor stream-,69
NA,lining refinements are also being made to the,69
NA,internal review system for child support de-,69
NA,cisions generally.,69
NA,The last of the 2004 bill measures are of a,69
NA,minor policy or technical nature and are gen-,69
NA,erally to address anomalies in the current,69
NA,system or to improve aspects of child support,69
NA,"administration-for example, amendments to",69
NA,broaden the ways in which an application for,69
NA,an extension of time to lodge an internal re-,69
NA,"view application, known as an ‘objection',",69
NA,can be made. The new bill also includes sev-,70
NA,eral family assistance amendments-for ex-,70
NA,"ample, the maintenance income test provi-",70
NA,sions for family tax benefit are being refined.,70
NA,This is partly to reflect the new treatment,70
NA,under the child support reforms for child,70
NA,support agreements and lump sum child sup-,70
NA,port.,70
NA,Refinements are also being made to cer-,70
NA,tain elements of the formula used to work,70
NA,out the notional amount of maintenance in-,70
NA,come an individual is taken to have received,70
NA,under a child support agreement or court,70
NA,order where there is an underpayment of,70
NA,child support registered for collection by the,70
NA,Child Support Agency. It is also being clari-,70
NA,fied that maintenance income received by a,70
NA,payee for one or more children would reduce,70
NA,the payee's amount of family tax benefit part,70
NA,A above the base rate for those children only.,70
NA,Separate amendments to the baby bonus,70
NA,provisions will formally rename the payment,70
NA,"the ‘baby bonus', rather than the ‘maternity",70
NA,"payment', in line with most people's under-",70
NA,standing. Under-18-year-old claimants will,70
NA,"be paid the baby bonus in 13 instalments,",70
NA,"rather than in a lump sum, and registration of",70
NA,birth as a condition of eligibility for the,70
NA,"bonus will be introduced. Under this bill, the",70
NA,usual 13-week period for full payment of,70
NA,family tax benefit while temporarily outside,70
NA,Australia will be extended for members of,70
NA,the Australian Defence Force and certain,70
NA,Australian Federal Police personnel in the,70
NA,International Deployment Group who are,70
NA,"deployed overseas as part of their duties and,",70
NA,"as a result, remain overseas for longer than",70
NA,13 weeks.,70
NA,Cyclone Larry has shown that a year may,70
NA,not be long enough where the rebuilding ef-,70
NA,forts of a disaster-affected community are,70
NA,stretched. The bill will extend the current 12,70
NA,months principal home temporary absence,70
NA,rules for absences of up to 24 months for,70
NA,people who have suffered loss or damage to,70
NA,their homes due to a disaster. The bill will,70
NA,also assist people who cannot purchase or,70
NA,build a new home within 12 months due to,70
NA,factors beyond their control by extending the,70
NA,asset test exemption of principal home sale,70
NA,proceeds from 12 months up to 24 months.,70
NA,Another measure ensures the claim rules for,70
NA,the new Australian government disaster re-,70
NA,covery payment work correctly for non-,70
NA,"resident Australian citizens. Lastly, the bill",70
NA,will make minor refinements to the operation,70
NA,of the income streams provisions of the so-,70
NA,cial security and veterans' means tests.,70
NA,"On behalf of the minister, I thank all of",70
NA,those officials and community members in-,70
NA,volved in the consultation for and prepara-,70

Mr GARRETT ,Kingsford Smith) (12.59,71
NA,pm)-The Great Barrier Reef is Australia's,71
NA,"greatest natural asset, an economic power-",71
NA,house and an extraordinary ambassador for,71
NA,Australia. The reef draws people to Australia,71
NA,and it draws Australians to Northern Queen-,71
NA,sland. It captures the imagination like no,71
NA,other Australian icon. It is a place that offers,71
NA,"serenity and stability, beauty and pleasure. It",71
NA,"is, as the Great Barrier Reef Foundation have",71
NA,"noted, ‘The largest, most pristine continuous",71
NA,"coral reef archipelago on earth', a natural",71
NA,icon that links to our national identity. We in,71
NA,Australia are so fortunate to be able to say,71
NA,that we come from the home of the Great,71
NA,Barrier Reef. But the truth is that our greatest,71
NA,natural asset is crook-really crook. I often,71
NA,wonder whether the Howard government,71
NA,cares at all about the fate of the reef. The,71
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment,71
NA,Bill 2007 is remarkable for what it does not,71
NA,do. It does not offer a plan to maintain a,71
NA,healthy reef into the future.,71
NA,The bill before the House seeks to imple-,71
NA,ment recommendations of a 2006 review of,71
NA,the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act,71
NA,1975. I want to pick up on the key aspects of,71
NA,"that review and this bill. But, before I do, it",71
NA,is important to set the scene. The Great Bar-,71
NA,rier Reef is an extraordinary natural wonder.,71
NA,It is the world's largest World Heritage,71
NA,"area-2,000 kilometres of World Heritage",71
NA,wonder. It is the world's most extensive coral,71
NA,reef system. It has the world's richest diver-,71
NA,"sity of faunal species. There are some 2,800",71
NA,"individual reefs, 1,500 fish species, 175 bird",71
NA,"species, some 4,000 species of mollusc-an",71
NA,"incredible figure-1,500 species of sponge,",71
NA,500 species of seaweed and more than 30,71
NA,species of marine mammals.,71
Dr EMERSON ,That's a lot of diversity.,71
Mr GARRETT,There is an extraordi-,71
NA,nary range of marine biodiversity and spe-,71
NA,cies diversity on the reef. There are 940 is-,71
NA,lands. The GBR is the jewel in the crown.,71
NA,The northern part of the reef is believed to be,71
NA,18 million years old and the southern part is,71
NA,believed to be two million years old. These,71
NA,are staggering statistics. The reef is a place,71
NA,of staggering beauty. This is our inheritance,71
NA,and we have a responsibility to protect it for,71
NA,future generations.,71
NA,"Of course, we do not just have a responsi-",71
NA,bility to maintain the ecological integrity of,71
NA,the Great Barrier Reef; we also have a re-,71
NA,sponsibility to maintain the jobs and the re-,71
NA,gional towns that are dependent on a healthy,71
NA,"reef. Around 200,000 jobs are directly de-",71
NA,"pendent on a healthy Great Barrier Reef, a",71
NA,reef that generates about $4.3 billion for the,71
NA,Australian economy. That is a substantial,71
NA,commitment that the Great Barrier Reef,71
NA,"makes, not only in terms of its environmental",71
NA,heritage and richness but also in terms of its,71
NA,economic productivity.,71
NA,But there are real threats to the future of,71
NA,the reef. The science is very clear. The unre-,71
NA,leased Australian chapter of the United Na-,71
NA,tions Intergovernmental Panel on Climate,71
NA,Change report Climate change 2007: climate,71
NA,"change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability",71
NA,lays out a bleak future for the Great Barrier,71
NA,"Reef. It says that, by 2020, 60 per cent of the",71
NA,Great Barrier Reef could be regularly,71
NA,"bleached; by 2050, 97 per cent of the reef",71
NA,could be bleached each year; and by 2080,71
NA,there could be ‘catastrophic mortality of,71
NA,coral species annually' and a 95 per cent de-,71
NA,crease in distribution of Great Barrier Reef,71
NA,species. There could be a loss of 65 per cent,71
NA,of Great Barrier Reef species in the Cairns,72
NA,region alone.,72
NA,An international team of scientists work-,72
NA,ing on the Great Barrier Reef has found a,72
NA,clear link between coral disease and warmer,72
NA,ocean temperatures. World-first research at,72
NA,"48 reefs spread along 1,500 kilometres of the",72
NA,"Great Barrier Reef, combined with six years",72
NA,"of satellite data on sea temperatures, has re-",72
NA,vealed ‘a highly significant relationship' be-,72
NA,tween ocean warming and the emergence of,72
NA,a disease known as white syndrome. And of,72
NA,"course, ocean warming is a consequence of",72
NA,climate change. White syndrome is one of a,72
NA,number of unexplained coral diseases which,72
NA,scientists have observed to be on the increase,72
NA,globally in recent years. This is enough to,72
NA,make you weep. The Great Barrier Reef is,72
NA,"dying before our very eyes and, frankly, it",72
NA,does not seem as if the Howard government,72
NA,gives a damn.,72
NA,The government cannot say it was not,72
NA,warned. It has received report after report for,72
NA,almost a decade about climate change and its,72
NA,"likely impacts-similar warnings, growing in",72
NA,strength with each report. The truth is the,72
NA,Prime Minister's in-tray is littered with re-,72
NA,ports warning of the threat of climate change,72
NA,to the Great Barrier Reef but his out-tray is,72
NA,filled with cobwebs. Look at the govern-,72
NA,ment's own March 2005 Climate change risk,72
NA,and vulnerability report. That report identi-,72
NA,fies the reef as one of ‘a handful of highly,72
NA,vulnerable regions [that] can be identified,72
NA,that should be given priority for further adap-,72
NA,tation planning and response'. The report,72
NA,goes on to say:,72
NA,Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef are expected,72
NA,to see multiple dimensions of change. The Reef,72
NA,itself is likely to suffer from coral bleaching,72
NA,"events, which have long recovery times and flow",72
NA,on effects for the whole ecosystem. Climate,72
NA,model projections suggest that within 40 years,72
NA,water temperatures could be above the survival,72
NA,limit of corals.,72
NA,And 40 years is within the lifetimes of many,72
NA,people in our country. You have to ask: what,72
NA,action has the Howard government under-,72
NA,taken in response to this stark warning? This,72
NA,is not just an environmental question. A 2005,72
NA,Access Economics study found that tourism,72
NA,associated with the Great Barrier Reef gen-,72
NA,erated over $4.48 billion in the 12-month,72
NA,period 2004-05 and provided employment,72
NA,"for about 63,000 people. The marine tourism",72
NA,industry is a major contributor to the local,72
NA,and Australian economy. These employment,72
NA,"statistics are significant, and the contribution",72
NA,"that the reef makes to local, regional and",72
NA,national economies is substantial. In 2007,72
NA,there are approximately 820 operators and,72
NA,"1,500 vessels and aircraft permitted to oper-",72
NA,ate in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.,72
NA,Tourism attracts approximately 1.9 million,72
NA,visitors each year. That is an extraordinary,72
NA,number of people who come to enjoy the,72
NA,"beauty, amenity and qualities that the Great",72
NA,Barrier Reef' has to offer. The reef is simply,72
NA,the lifeblood of regional and local econo-,72
NA,mies. That is why the Howard government's,72
NA,line-a calculated line-that Australians,72
NA,have to choose between a healthy economy,72
NA,and a healthy environment is so wrong. The,72
NA,Great Barrier Reef's extraordinary environ-,72
NA,mental values and its profound contribution,72
NA,to our national economy go hand in hand and,72
NA,provide the clearest rebuttal that Australians,72
NA,could ever seek of the false choices that are,72
NA,put forward by the Howard government,72
NA,when the Prime Minister and others put the,72
NA,line that we have to maintain protection of,72
NA,jobs at the expense of looking after the envi-,72
NA,ronment. Nothing could be further from the,72
NA,truth.,72
NA,The Great Barrier Reef brings billions of,72
NA,dollars into the Australian economy and is,72
NA,directly responsible for the employment of,72
NA,tens of thousands of Australians. So the,72
NA,question is this: how much new money do,72
NA,you reckon the government allocated in last,72
NA,night's budget to deliver a healthy reef? The,73
NA,"answer is that at last night's budget, the",73
NA,"budget, $30 million over four years-some",73
NA,$7 million or so a year-was allocated to the,73
NA,"Great Barrier Reef in new funding. That,",73
NA,"frankly, is pitiful. The government has an-",73
NA,nounced $15.9 million over four years for,73
NA,field management. Labor would like to see,73
NA,"the details of the field management, but that",73
NA,is something which we broadly support. The,73
NA,government has also announced $14.2 mil-,73
NA,lion for the continuation of the water quality,73
NA,monitoring program and that that money will,73
NA,come from the Natural Heritage Trust. So we,73
NA,"will wait to see whether that is new money,",73
NA,but it is a program that we would welcome.,73
NA,These are small initiatives by any reckon-,73
NA,"ing, made by a government that does not",73
NA,understand the huge climate change chal-,73
NA,lenges facing Australia. A forward looking,73
NA,government would have used a federal,73
NA,budget to develop and implement an action,73
NA,plan to help protect the Great Barrier Reef,73
NA,from the effects of coral bleaching and to,73
NA,protect Australian jobs and industries de-,73
NA,pendent on a healthy reef. A forward looking,73
NA,government would have used a federal,73
NA,budget to implement a national climate,73
NA,change strategy that would include ratifying,73
NA,"the Kyoto protocol, cutting Australia's",73
NA,"greenhouse pollution by 60 per cent by 2050,",73
NA,establishing a national emissions trading,73
NA,scheme and seriously investing in renewable,73
NA,energy and clean coal.,73
NA,A forward looking government would,73
NA,have announced serious long-term measures,73
NA,to cut Australia's soaring greenhouse pollu-,73
NA,tion. But that is not what we got in last,73
NA,night's federal budget. Climate change is a,73
NA,massive challenge for Australia but the,73
NA,Howard government is simply trying to slay,73
NA,the dragon with a feather. The federal budget,73
NA,will not stop Australia's greenhouse gas pol-,73
NA,lution from soaring by 27 per cent by 2020.,73
NA,The federal budget will not build a strong,73
NA,Australian clean energy industry. The federal,73
NA,2007 budget will not create new Australian clean,73
NA,coal jobs. The federal budget failed the cli-,73
NA,mate change test. That is what happened last,73
NA,night when the Treasurer brought down his,73
NA,budget: the government failed the climate,73
NA,change test.,73
NA,The other thing a forward looking gov-,73
NA,ernment would do is to cherish Australia's,73
NA,past-to recognise that our natural and cul-,73
NA,tural heritage is the cornerstone of our mod-,73
NA,ern society. That is why I find it staggering,73
NA,that the government still has not placed the,73
NA,Great Barrier Reef on Australia's Natural,73
NA,Heritage List. A Natural Heritage List with-,73
NA,out the Great Barrier Reef is like a cricket,73
NA,hall of fame without Sir Donald Bradman-,73
NA,but that is precisely what we have. The Natu-,73
NA,ral Heritage List came into force in January,73
NA,2004; it is now 2007. It beggars belief that,73
NA,the government has not got around to putting,73
NA,the reef on the Natural Heritage List. We are,73
NA,entitled to ask ourselves whether it is incom-,73
NA,"petence, tardiness or forgetfulness, or",73
NA,whether the Howard government is just tak-,73
NA,ing the Great Barrier Reef for granted. Is it,73
NA,taking the people who depend on a healthy,73
NA,"reef for granted, as well? The government",73
NA,seems to have given up on the Great Barrier,73
NA,"Reef, our greatest national natural treasure.",73
NA,Previously the government took a very,73
NA,courageous step when it announced it was,73
NA,protecting 33 per cent of the Great Barrier,73
NA,Reef from fishing and other extractive indus-,73
NA,tries. I want to take this opportunity in the,73
NA,House to pay tribute to the then environment,73
NA,"minister, David Kemp, who will always be",73
NA,remembered for that initiative-one which,73
NA,Labor supported. But what has the govern-,73
NA,ment done since then? It announced a struc-,73
NA,tural adjustment package for the fishing in-,73
NA,"dustry. Initially, the structural adjustment",73
NA,package was worth $31 million. Now it has,73
NA,"increased threefold, flowing out to more than",73
NA,$87 million-an extraordinary miscalcula-,73
NA,tion. Fishermen and land based businesses,74
NA,that rely on reef derived income are entitled,74
NA,to compensation for economic loss caused,74
NA,"under the Representative Areas Program,",74
NA,which increased the reef green zones. They,74
NA,deserve compensation; they do not deserve,74
NA,the mess that is the compensation package.,74
NA,The National Party and some of the more,74
NA,conservative elements of the Liberal Party,74
NA,have worked hard in the past to destroy Dr,74
NA,Kemp's legacy. Strong campaigns have been,74
NA,launched against the Great Barrier Reef Ma-,74
NA,rine Park Authority and the zoning plan. On,74
NA,"1 March 2005, the then National Party sena-",74
NA,tor-elect Barnaby Joyce was quoted in the,74
NA,Courier Mail as opposing the Great Barrier,74
NA,Reef Marine Park Authority's existence as an,74
NA,independent agency. He said:,74
NA,GBRMPA is out of control ...We are having too,74
NA,many problems and we should bring it totally,74
NA,under government control and baby-sit it for a,74
NA,while.,74
NA,"On 26 October 2004, the member for Daw-",74
NA,son said:,74
NA,What we've had is a statutory body in GBRMPA,74
NA,"that is out of control that has put, I think,",74
NA,scientific basis for the arguments they've put for-,74
NA,ward.,74
NA,It must never be forgotten that the Queen-,74
NA,sland Nationals did a preference deal with,74
NA,the Fishing Party at the last election on the,74
NA,basis that GBRMPA's powers be moved into,74
NA,the department where the minister would,74
NA,have control of all decisions. This helped get,74
NA,Senator Joyce elected.,74
NA,The National Party always saw the review,74
NA,of GBRMPA as the vehicle for destroying,74
NA,GBRMPA and rolling back the protection of,74
NA,"the Great Barrier Reef. On 25 March 2006,",74
NA,the Courier Mail reported that the Howard,74
NA,government was planning to reduce the ma-,74
NA,rine protection boundaries of the Representa-,74
NA,tive Areas Program and to abolish the Great,74
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority as an,74
NA,independent agency. I am pleased to say nei-,74
NA,ther of those two things happened. I am also,74
NA,pleased that GBRMPA remains a statutory,74
NA,authority. I want to pay tribute to the member,74
NA,"for Grayndler, who was my predecessor as",74
NA,"shadow minister for the environment, to",74
NA,Senator Jan MCLucas and to Labor's candi-,74
NA,"date for Leichhardt, Jim Turnour, for their",74
NA,hard yakka and dedication to the protection,74
NA,of the Great Barrier Reef.,74
NA,Labor prevented the destruction of,74
NA,"GBRMPA, but there are still aspects of this",74
NA,bill that are concerning. The bill replaces the,74
NA,Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee,74
NA,with a non-statutory advisory board and re-,74
NA,moves the requirement for specific represen-,74
NA,tation from the Queensland government or,74
NA,the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait,74
NA,Islanders. Labor is concerned that the part-,74
NA,"nership with the Queensland government,",74
NA,which has been such a hallmark of the work,74
NA,"of GBRMPA, has in effect been shredded.",74
NA,The opposition is also concerned that there,74
NA,may not be the opportunity for proper repre-,74
NA,"sentation from Indigenous communities,",74
NA,no real which ought to be a feature of the proposed,74
NA,new arrangements. Labor is also concerned,74
NA,"that other interests, including the tourism",74
NA,"industry, may not be adequately represented",74
NA,on GBRMPA or the advisory board. That is a,74
NA,matter the government ought to give full,74
NA,consideration to. I call on the environment,74
NA,minister to make a commitment to a genuine,74
NA,partnership with the Queensland govern-,74
NA,"ment, to a genuine engagement with Abo-",74
NA,riginal and Torres Strait Islander communi-,74
NA,ties and to a real and genuine engagement,74
NA,with all the industries that are dependent on a,74
NA,healthy reef. A place must be found for eve-,74
NA,ryone at the table.,74
NA,I am pleased-and Labor welcomes-that,74
NA,the government is establishing a five-yearly,74
NA,outlook report for the Great Barrier Reef.,74
NA,The environment minister has stated that a,74
NA,regular and reliable means of assessing the,74
NA,protection of the Great Barrier Reef will be,75
NA,provided through a formal outlook report,75
NA,that will be tabled in parliament every five,75
NA,years and that this report will cover the,75
NA,"agement of the marine park, the overall con-",75
NA,dition of the ecosystem and the longer term,75
NA,outlook for the Great Barrier Reef. This re-,75
NA,port clearly is an important measure and it,75
NA,has Labor's support. This report will be peer,75
NA,reviewed by an appropriately qualified panel,75
NA,of experts appointed by the minister. Labor,75
NA,welcomes those measures but seeks confir-,75
NA,mation from the minister that the peer report,75
NA,"will be a public document, as this is not prodrilling",75
NA,vided for in the bill before us.,75
NA,Labor notes that the minister will be re-,75
NA,sponsible for any future decision to amend,75
NA,the zoning plan and that any such decision,75
NA,will be based on the outlook report and ad-,75
NA,vice from the authority. Labor also notes the,75
NA,minister's commitment that engagement with,75
NA,stakeholders on the development of a new,75
NA,zoning plan will be improved and the process,75
NA,made more transparent-that is clearly nec-,75
NA,essary-with comprehensive information,75
NA,being made publicly available throughout the,75
NA,process that will include the rationale for,75
NA,"amending the zoning plan, the principles on",75
NA,which the development of the zoning plan,75
NA,"will be based, socioeconomic information,",75
NA,and a report on the final zoning plan and its,75
NA,"outcomes. In addition, each of the two public",75
NA,consultation periods will be increased from,75
NA,one month to three months. We welcome the,75
NA,extension of the public consultation period.,75
NA,It is important there is integrity in the,75
NA,"process, and it is important there are ongoing",75
NA,commitments to better protecting the health,75
NA,of the Great Barrier Reef. That is why I call,75
NA,on the government to join Labor in opposing,75
NA,oil drilling and exploration near the Great,75
NA,Barrier Reef. I foreshadow now that I will,75
NA,move consideration-in-detail amendments to,75
NA,extend the boundary of the Great Barrier,75
NA,Reef Marine Park region to the Exclusive,75
NA,"Economic Zone, and I call on the govern-",75
NA,ment to support those amendments.,75
NA,I am deeply concerned that the govern-,75
NA,manment's agenda is to proceed with the oil ex-,75
NA,ploration and drilling near the Great Barrier,75
NA,"Reef. Just last year, Geoscience Australia",75
NA,published a map which indicated the poten-,75
NA,tial for exploration and drilling in this region.,75
NA,Under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,75
NA,"Act 1975, any oil drilling or prospecting in",75
NA,the Great Barrier Reef region is prohibited.,75
NA,My consideration in detail stage amendments,75
NA,will seek to extend the region so that oil,75
NA,and prospecting in the Great Barrier,75
NA,"Reef region, the region east of the boundary",75
NA,of the current marine park to the Exclusive,75
NA,"Economic Zone, will be prohibited.",75
NA,Whilst it is the case that the governance,75
NA,and associated measures contained in this,75
NA,"bill are supported by the opposition, it re-",75
NA,mains a fact that the government's abysmal,75
NA,record in seriously addressing climate,75
NA,change is a significant impediment to ensur-,75
NA,ing protection of the great natural treasure,75
NA,that is the Great Barrier Reef into the future.,75
NA,I hereby move:,75
NA,That all words after “That” be omitted with a,75
NA,view to substituting the following words: “whilst,75
NA,"not declining to give the bill a second reading, the",75
NA,House:,75
NA,(1) affirms the object of the Principal Act - the,75
NA,protection of the Great Barrier Reef - but,75
NA,notes that the future of the reef is threatened,75
NA,"by both short term and longer term factors,",75
NA,including climate change;,75
NA,(2) notes that the United Nations Intergovern-,75
NA,mental Panel on Climate Change stated in,75

The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Hat-,76
NA,ton)-Is the amendment seconded?,76
Dr EMERSON ,I second the amendment,76
NA,and reserve my right to speak.,76
Mr ENTSCH ,Leichhardt) (1.21 pm)-I,76
NA,sat here with an element of disbelief as I,76
NA,heard the member for Kingsford Smith put-,76
NA,ting forth his vision for the Great Barrier,76
NA,Reef. I could not help but think that a lot of,76
NA,"the problems, misconceptions, scare tactics",76
NA,and emotional claptrap that continues to be,76
NA,driven about this comes from his background,76
NA,in the cradle of the extreme greens. There is,76
NA,no science in these arguments.,76
NA,Mr Garrett interjecting-,76
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Hat-,76
NA,"ton)-Member for Kingsford Smith, you had",76
NA,your go.,76
Mr ENTSCH,He stands up in his place,76
NA,and talks about a whole range of issues here.,76
NA,"One of the figures that I picked up here,",76
NA,which is basically one of the lies that was,76
NA,projected through the whole of the represen-,76
NA,"tative areas debate, is that 33 per cent of the",76
NA,Great Barrier Reef is now being protected. It,76
NA,is not 33 per cent of the Great Barrier Reef,76
NA,that is currently protected; it is 33 per cent of,76
NA,"the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which",76
NA,goes way outside the Great Barrier Reef. In,76
NA,"fact, over 70 per cent of the Great Barrier",76
NA,Reef is protected.,76
NA,This is where the issues started to come,76
NA,in. You have those like the previous,76
NA,speaker-coming from the ‘extreme green',76
NA,angle-who believe that people have no,76
NA,place in the environment. They believe that,76
NA,the only way you can manage these places is,76
NA,and inby shutting them down completely and re-,76
NA,moving people out of them-they do not,76
NA,know what the word ‘sustainability' means-,76
NA,"and, in doing so, destroying people's liveli-",76
NA,hoods unnecessarily. That is what happened,76
NA,in relation to the management of the Great,76
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park.,76
NA,I am certainly pleased to have the oppor-,76
NA,tunity to speak here on the Great Barrier,76
NA,"Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 2007,",76
NA,because these are very important amend-,76
NA,ments. They emanate from a review of the,76
NA,"Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority,",76
NA,which was completed last year. The review,76
NA,and its report delivered on a promise made,76
NA,by this government in 2004 after the travesty,76
NA,known as the Representative Areas Program.,76
NA,This legislation has been born out of a need,76
NA,and a desire of all government members to,76
NA,ensure that this type of event does not ever,76
NA,happen again. We cannot turn back the clock;,76
NA,"we must learn from the experience, and we",76
NA,should not be repeating the sins of the past.,76
NA,When these amendments come into force,76
NA,"on 1 July this year, they will ensure the au-",76
NA,thority of future management decisions will,76
NA,not be exclusively within the Great Barrier,76
NA,Reef Marine Park Authority but that the im-,76
NA,pacts will be considered back here. The,76
NA,amendments will provide a seven-year mora-,76
NA,torium for the future adjustments to provide,76
NA,stability-and this is absolutely necessary-,76
NA,and certainty for businesses and communi-,76
NA,"ties, which have suffered so unnecessarily in",76
NA,the years since the current zoning plan was,76
NA,imposed. They will also provide a regular,76
NA,"and reliable means of accountability, assess-",76
NA,ing the protection of the marine park through,76
NA,a report that will be tabled in the parliament,76
NA,"every five years, and this will be peer re-",76
NA,viewed by a panel of experts appointed by,76
NA,the minister. That will ultimately mean that it,76
NA,will be the minister's responsibility for future,77
NA,decisions about opening the zoning plan for,77
NA,"amendment. Importantly, the process of en-",77
NA,gaging with stakeholders on future,77
NA,changes-and this is the area that was,77
NA,missed out significantly during the last proc-,77
NA,"ess-will be improved and formalised, in-",77
NA,cluding extending each of the two public,77
NA,consultation periods from one month to three,77
NA,"months. These are, in my view, very positive",77
NA,but very necessary changes.,77
NA,"If there is a reservation, it is the fact",77
NA,unfortunately these changes have come a,77
NA,little too late for many of my constituents,77
NA,who have been impacted by these agendas.,77
NA,Anybody who has any doubts about the ex-,77
NA,tent of the misery and the financial ruination,77
NA,wreaked by those ideological zealots who,77
NA,were in charge of this process through the,77
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority,77
NA,"need only speak to people-good, honest,",77
NA,hardworking people-whose businesses and,77
NA,"livelihoods have been destroyed, absolutely",77
NA,"devastated, by this process; unfortunately, in",77
NA,"many cases, totally unnecessarily.",77
NA,I first expressed concerns about the rezon-,77
NA,"ing in 2002 when it was first mooted, but I",77
NA,was reassured by the senior executive of the,77
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority,77
NA,that the whole process would be based on,77
NA,"science. On that basis, I accepted it. I ac-",77
NA,cepted that advice in good faith. I spoke to,77
NA,"the recreational fishing people, commercial",77
NA,fishing people and tourism industry people.,77
NA,"They all agreed that, if science were applied",77
NA,to this and the science said that any activ-,77
NA,"ity-irrespective of what it was, whether it",77
NA,"was swimming on the reef, fishing on the",77
NA,reef or a commercial activity-was deemed,77
NA,"to be unsustainable, any such activity had to",77
NA,stop immediately. Every one of them was,77
NA,prepared to give up their livelihoods on that,77
NA,basis.,77
NA,"Unfortunately, that was the first lie. When",77
NA,the first round of plans came out and was,77
NA,"presented to the stakeholders, everybody was",77
NA,quite pleasantly surprised. They believed that,77
NA,"everything was okay, that it was quite rea-",77
NA,sonable. Even though the ‘extreme greens',77
NA,were promoting the idea that only three per,77
NA,cent of the reef was protected-a bit like the,77
NA,member for Kingsford Smith's little slip with,77
NA,the words in his contribution-in fact it was,77
NA,three per cent of the marine park. So about,77
NA,that 22 or 23 per cent of the reef was protected at,77
NA,that point in time. We were assured by the,77
NA,authority that they were looking at 25 per,77
NA,cent of the reef. They were looking at biore-,77
NA,"gions. At the end of the day, they ended up",77
NA,with over 70 per cent. You can imagine the,77
NA,impact that that has had on users of those,77
NA,reefs.,77
NA,"They presented those maps, and the maps",77
NA,appeared to be okay. They seemed to have a,77
NA,"minimum impact, as we were assured by the",77
NA,bureaucracy. But the interesting thing was,77
NA,that the bureaucracy then invited the reef,77
NA,"users, the marine park users, to mark the ar-",77
NA,"eas that they could never afford to lose, so",77
NA,that they could be taken into consideration in,77
NA,the final determination. The coordinates of,77
NA,those areas were very specifically marked on,77
NA,"the map. When the next draft came out,",77
NA,every single area that had been marked by,77
NA,those reef users as an area they could not,77
NA,afford to lose was marked in either green or,77
NA,"yellow, excluding them. And that set the tone",77
NA,for the treatment.,77
NA,We had a coastal trawl industry which had,77
NA,been assessed by the Great Barrier Reef Ma-,77
NA,rine Park Authority and by Environment,77
NA,Australia as the first ecologically sustainable,77
NA,coastal trawl fishery in the world-they were,77
NA,waiting on certification-but the changes to,77
NA,"those maps, taking those areas out, totally",77
NA,wiped them out. There was clearly an intent,77
NA,within the senior bureaucracy of the Great,77
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to get rid,77
NA,of reef and marine park users. They did this,78
NA,"with the marine collectors, the commercial",78
NA,"trawling industry, the line fishermen and the",78
NA,recreational fishing industry. They drove a,78
NA,"wedge between each of the user groups, cre-",78
NA,"ating conflict, and they used that opportunity",78
NA,to go in and amend the maps accordingly.,78
NA,"Make no bones about it, every one of the",78
NA,people affected by that was committed to,78
NA,stepping aside-losing their business if nec-,78
NA,essary-if it was deemed to be unsustain-,78
NA,able. But it was no longer an issue. It was,78
NA,"driving the same agenda, the same mantra,",78
NA,that was pushed by the member for Kings-,78
NA,ford Smith in his previous interests as a,78
NA,member of the extreme greens and influ-,78
NA,enced very strongly by some members of the,78
NA,senior bureaucracy within the Great Barrier,78
NA,Reef Marine Park Authority.,78
NA,I said to Minister Kemp that this would,78
NA,have a devastating effect on industry. I sug-,78
NA,gested to him that it could have as much as,78
NA,$2 million worth of impact on our industries.,78
NA,The minister said to me: ‘That can't be pos-,78
NA,"sible, because the Great Barrier Reef Marine",78
NA,Park Authority has advised me that the,78
NA,maximum impact will be $1.5 million. What,78
NA,are you doing? You are stirring up a lot of,78
NA,trouble about nothing.' But he erred on the,78
NA,side of caution and set aside $10 million in,78
NA,the original bill just in case the compensation,78
NA,was a little more-just in case the authority,78
NA,had miscalculated. We have not paid out $85,78
NA,"million, as was suggested by the member for",78
NA,Kingsford Smith. We are moving towards,78
NA,$200 million. There was another claim just,78
NA,the other day. Lyle Squire has a third genera-,78
NA,tion small family business which breeds cor-,78
NA,als and collects small marine fish for aquari-,78
NA,ums. They have been doing it for three gen-,78
NA,erations and it has been deemed by the Great,78
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to be,78
NA,totally ecologically sustainable. I was ad-,78
NA,vised a couple of days ago that they are look-,78
NA,ing at a compensation package of $3.5 mil-,78
NA,lion to compensate them for their loss-a,78
NA,small family business absolutely devastated.,78
NA,We have lost so many businesses because,78
NA,"of this, and so many of them have been lost",78
NA,"totally unnecessarily. Mitchell's Marine,",78
NA,"which is owned by Wayne and Sally Bayne,",78
NA,is a marine retail outlet which has been suc-,78
NA,cessfully trading since 1984. The impact of,78
NA,the actions by the Great Barrier Reef Marine,78
NA,Park Authority resulted in their unit number,78
NA,of sales falling by almost 40 per cent in both,78
NA,commercial and recreational markets-they,78
NA,just went into freefall. This has resulted in,78
NA,"staff reductions, downsizing of premises and",78
NA,slashing of costs. It means a once-valuable,78
NA,asset that has provided security for the own-,78
NA,ers' family and its future retirement has been,78
NA,unnecessarily and permanently damaged by a,78
NA,government department which is allowed to,78
NA,provide misinformation to government on,78
NA,which to base its decisions.,78
NA,Another one is Bill Izzard. The day after,78
NA,the rezoning he woke up to find that he had,78
NA,lost nearly 90 per cent of his available,78
NA,grounds. He was collecting a specific prod-,78
NA,uct which they call leader prawns. He was,78
NA,targeting the aquaculture industry. He was,78
NA,very successful and he was very specific in,78
NA,what he was targeting. He needed only a,78
NA,very narrow area from which to take his,78
NA,product. He was one of those who sat down,78
NA,and marked those areas-none of them on,78
NA,the reef. He said: ‘These are the areas I need.,78
NA,Without these areas my business will go,78
NA,broke.' This is where they took 90 per cent of,78
NA,his business. They wiped him out. It is just a,78
NA,"disgrace. As Bill said, it was the straw that",78
NA,broke the camel's back and started the,78
NA,"downhill spiral, sending dozens of family",78
NA,fishers like him to the wall. The industry has,78
NA,"shrunk, investors have lost confidence and",78
NA,the industry has continued to lose experi-,78
NA,enced skippers and crews.,78
NA,Marlin Charters at Airlie Beach is another,79
NA,one. It has been successfully operating since,79
NA,"1989. Its owner, Ken Bryant, was another",79
NA,"victim of the scam. He was told, ‘Tell us",79
NA,which locations are important to you and we,79
NA,will make sure that we leave them alone.' In,79
NA,"fact, the opposite happened and, with the",79
NA,"stroke of a pen, much of the operating",79
NA,grounds were lost. Left with virtually no-,79
NA,"where to operate, the business has suffered a",79
NA,72 per cent drop in income. That has left the,79
NA,business absolutely devastated. I received an,79
NA,email from Ken the other day. He said: ‘I've,79
NA,had my business destroyed by RAP. I'm ap-,79
NA,"proximately $100,000 in debt and to date",79
NA,have been offered nothing in compensation,79
NA,or assistance. My life has been devastated by,79
NA,"RAP, with no assistance or compensation. I",79
NA,"need assistance not next week, not tomorrow,",79
NA,"but now. I'm contemplating bankruptcy or,",79
NA,"sadly, suicide.' That is the sort of impact it",79
NA,has had on the lives of so many people.,79
NA,"MCLeod Engineering, a land based busi-",79
NA,"ness, is another example that I would like to",79
NA,"highlight, because it demonstrates the flow-",79
NA,on effect for many onshore businesses as,79
NA,well. They are an iconic business which has,79
NA,been operating in the Cairns area for over 30,79
NA,years. They provide marine engineering ser-,79
NA,vices for both recreational and commercial,79
NA,services. The introduction of the rezoning by,79
NA,the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Author-,79
NA,ity has seen their business halved. Staff lev-,79
NA,els have been reduced by 40 per cent and the,79
NA,owner is fighting to protect what is left of his,79
NA,once-thriving business. With a bleak future,79
NA,"ahead, the owners are now left with no alter-",79
NA,native but to reassess their commitment to,79
NA,the industry as they oversee the unnecessary,79
NA,destruction of their life's work. I could go,79
NA,on. There have been dozens of these cases.,79
NA,I have got to say that I was very disap-,79
NA,pointed that I was not listened to back in,79
NA,2002 when the first tranche of this legislation,79
NA,came through. I have to give credit to the,79
NA,then Minister for the Environment and Heri-,79
NA,"tage, Senator Campbell, who did listen. He",79
NA,started the process of introducing the bill that,79
NA,we are talking to today and he was able to,79
NA,help us to gain some ground and to at least,79
NA,"give some dignity, by trying to help them",79
NA,"restructure, to some of those people who",79
NA,have lost so much. I also give credit to the,79
NA,Minister for the Environment and Water Re-,79
NA,"sources, Mr Turnbull. He and his office have",79
NA,been very helpful in trying to sort out these,79
NA,problems.,79
NA,The member for Kingsford Smith made,79
NA,reference to some individuals from the other,79
NA,side of politics that claim to have made some,79
NA,effort up there-but they were never heard of,79
NA,during the whole debate. We talk about Sena-,79
NA,tor MCLucas and others and about the previ-,79
NA,ous shadow environment minister-I know,79
NA,"his name; it is Mr Albanese, but I am not",79
NA,sure of his seat-,79
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Hat-,79
NA,ton)-He is the member for Grayndler.,79
Mr ENTSCH,"Yes, the member for",79
NA,Grayndler. They actually fed a lot of the de-,79
NA,ception that created this problem and made,79
NA,no effort at all to try to do anything to save,79
NA,the situation. He talks about ‘a forward-,79
NA,looking government' that would protect the,79
NA,industries and people depending on a healthy,79
NA,reef. What a load of nonsense! You do not,79
NA,see a forward-looking government on the,79
NA,"other side, I can assure you of that, when we",79
NA,are talking about this. This was not about,79
NA,protecting the reef; this was all about push-,79
NA,ing the lock-out views of the extreme greens.,79
NA,"Unfortunately, some sections of the bureauc-",79
NA,racy were captured by it and so many indi-,79
NA,viduals' healthy businesses that were very,79
NA,dependent on a healthy reef were destroyed,79
NA,unnecessarily. As I said at the beginning of,79
NA,"my speech, had there been any issue as to",79
NA,sustainability then each and every owner of,79
NA,those businesses would have more than will-,79
NA,ingly walked away from the industries in-,80
NA,"volved and started again, accepting that they",80
NA,could not afford to impact on what was their,80
NA,livelihood.,80
NA,So I am pleased to see these legislative,80
NA,amendments coming through. I hope that by,80
NA,bringing these amendments through we do,80
NA,not allow this type of fiasco to occur again. I,80
NA,hope that we can resolve the outstanding,80
NA,problems of so many of those businesses that,80
NA,are struggling to survive. The government,80
NA,has been very generous in dealing with this,80
NA,"issue, but unfortunately in some cases mak-",80
NA,ing assessments has taken far too much time.,80
NA,As I can understand the complexities of,80
NA,"some of these businesses, I am sure there",80
NA,was no understanding by their owners at the,80
NA,"beginning, given the misinformation that was",80
NA,being provided by the bureaucracy at the,80
NA,"time, of the changes. There was no way that",80
NA,they would have been able to appreciate their,80
NA,impact and the damage that was being done.,80
NA,"On a final point, I refer to another matter",80
NA,raised by the member for Kingsford Smith. It,80
NA,"was a little red herring, which was right up",80
NA,"there with all the doom and gloom, about",80
NA,drilling on or around the Great Barrier Reef.,80
NA,This is a perpetual chestnut. Every time,80
NA,when they run out of good ideas they slip,80
NA,this one in. The reality is that the Great,80
NA,rier Reef Marine Park is protected in a way,80
NA,that it has never ever been protected before,80
NA,and there is absolutely no risk whatsoever of,80
NA,it being drilled or impacted. There is legisla-,80
NA,tion in place that makes sure that will not and,80
NA,cannot happen. But it is all part of their scare,80
NA,tactics. When they have no ideas and they,80
NA,are looking at these ideological agendas that,80
NA,"they try to push, they come out and push this",80
NA,"nonsense about drilling on the reef, trying to",80
NA,frighten people. Those that know know it is,80
NA,absolute nonsense and there is no basis of,80
NA,fact whatsoever in it.,80
Mr MARTIN FERGUSON ,Batman),80
NA,(1.41 pm)-While it was a privilege to have,80
NA,been in the House to hear the member for,80
NA,"Leichhardt, I must say, as he has raised the",80
NA,"issue of drilling, that I would have thought,",80
NA,as the member for Leichhardt's electorate,80
NA,includes a huge slice of the Great Barrier,80
NA,"Reef, he would have raised practical prob-",80
NA,"lems, such as the crown-of-thorns starfish,",80
NA,and talked about the need to give the indus-,80
NA,try up there greater assistance than it is cur-,80
NA,rently receiving from the government. He,80
NA,should have noted the huge challenge to the,80
NA,industry at this very point in time and not,80
NA,raised some futuristic debate about drilling,80
NA,on the Great Barrier Reef-but then he is not,80
NA,known for practical solutions to readily evi-,80
NA,dent problems.,80
NA,It is a great pleasure to speak to the Great,80
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill,80
NA,2007. It is a very important bill. It is of criti-,80
NA,cal significance to one of my shadow portfo-,80
NA,"lio responsibilities, tourism. We all appreci-",80
NA,ate its importance. To be fair to the member,80
NA,"for Leichhardt, he too understands the impor-",80
NA,tance of the tourism industry. It is a $75 bil-,80
NA,lion industry that employs over half a million,80
NA,"Australians. It is a huge driver of jobs, espe-",80
NA,"cially for young people, in Australia, espe-",80
NA,Bar- cially in regional communities. We appreci-,80
NA,ate that each year there are over two million,80
NA,"visitors to the Great Barrier Reef, with the",80
NA,latest Access Economics report citing marine,80
NA,tourism directly related to the reef as being,80
NA,worth a huge $5.8 billion and employing,80
NA,"63,000 people. So the reef is exceptionally",80
NA,important not just to Queensland but also to,80
NA,our national economy. From Cooktown to,80
NA,"Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Gladstone,",80
NA,marine tourism is a significant export earner,80
NA,underpinning the area's economy and dwarf-,80
NA,ing other industries such as commercial fish-,80
NA,ing. It is second only to mining.,80
NA,The opposition understands how impor-,80
NA,"tant tourism is to the region, and this is why I",80
NA,stand here today to express concern over,81
NA,"some aspects of the bill. Unfortunately, this",81
NA,bill essentially seeks to amend the act to,81
NA,plement in some instances key recommenda-,81
NA,tions of the Uhrig review whose intent might,81
NA,be wrong. There are several key common-,81
NA,"sense amendments proposed by the bill, yet",81
NA,there are also some potentially damaging,81
NA,aspects that could undermine the growth po-,81
NA,tential of Australia's tourism industry,81
NA,marine tourism sector in particular.,81
NA,The bill makes the Minister for the Envi-,81
NA,ronment and Water Resources responsible for,81
NA,any future decision to amend the zoning plan,81
NA,and replaces the Great Barrier Reef Consul-,81
NA,tative Committee with a non-statutory advi-,81
NA,sory body. The members of the Great Barrier,81
NA,Marine Park Authority will be increased,81
NA,from a minimum of two and a maximum of,81
NA,four to a maximum of five. I note that the,81
NA,authority currently consists of a full-time,81
NA,chairman and three part-time members. One,81
NA,of the part-time members is nominated by,81
NA,the Queensland government. The current act,81
NA,also provides for one of the part-time mem-,81
NA,bers to be appointed to represent the interests,81
NA,of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,81
NA,communities living adjacent to the marine,81
NA,"park. Unfortunately, and this is very impor-",81
NA,"tant, the bill no longer provides for the",81
NA,matic representation of the Queensland gov-,81
NA,ernment or the interests of the Aboriginal and,81
NA,Torres Strait Islander communities. That is,81
NA,just plain wrong.,81
NA,"In fact, the Minister for the Environment",81
NA,and Water Resources has been given greatly,81
NA,increased powers under the bill to appoint,81
NA,members of the authority and the advisory,81
NA,"board, and caution should be exercised in",81
NA,adopting these amendments. There are no,81
NA,guarantees any more that the interests of the,81
NA,Indigenous communities and the Queensland,81
NA,tourism industry will be adequately repre-,81
NA,sented on the appropriate advisory body.,81
NA,The reef is the most significant attraction,81
NA,for tourism within the Northern Queensland,81
NA,"im- region, with about 80 per cent of tourists",81
NA,visiting the reef at least once during their,81
NA,visit. It is also important to Aboriginal and,81
NA,Torres Strait Islander people who have a long,81
NA,and continuing relationship with the Great,81
NA,Barrier Reef region and its natural resources.,81
NA,The reef also provides opportunities for local,81
NA,and its communities to grow and become self-,81
NA,"sustaining. Trade networks, beliefs, music,",81
NA,"art, laws and creation stories are still alive",81
NA,and continue to this very day within these,81
NA,communities. Empowering Indigenous peo-,81
NA,ples through involvement in all tiers of man-,81
NA,agement will help develop effective and ac-,81
NA,ceptable solutions for key Indigenous issues,81
NA,and is crucial for effective management of,81
NA,the marine park.,81
NA,"It is for these reasons, and for the sake of",81
NA,"our environmental heritage, that we need to",81
NA,ensure that the reef is managed effectively,81
NA,and according to best practice. The marine,81
NA,"park, as we appreciate, is enormous and",81
NA,"spans over 344,400 square kilometres. The",81
NA,"reef sprawls for over 2,000 kilometres and is",81
NA,"made up of about 3,000 individual coral",81
NA,reefs. Like the ecosystems that define the,81
NA,"beauty of the reef, management of the park is",81
NA,autocomplex and diverse in the range of issues,81
NA,"that need to be addressed. Coral bleaching,",81
NA,"nutrient run-off, overfishing, warmer ocean",81
NA,"temperatures, coral disease, rainstorms and",81
NA,pest outbreaks-like the crown-of-thorns,81
NA,starfish-are all factors that need to be ad-,81
NA,dressed in actively managing the marine,81
NA,park.,81
NA,A lot of attention has been given over re-,81
NA,cent years to the issue of the crown-of-thorns,81
NA,"starfish, commonly known as COTS. They",81
NA,are not an introduced species as they inhabit,81
NA,"most coral reefs around the world. However,",81
NA,if the natural conditions of the reef are al-,81
NA,"tered, outbreaks occur with devastating ef-",81
NA,"fects. In 2003, for instance, there was an out-",81
NA,break on the reefs between Cairns and the,82
NA,Whitsunday Islands which cost operators and,82
NA,the Queensland and Commonwealth gov-,82
NA,ernments about $3 million a year to control.,82
NA,"When starfish numbers are too large, there is",82
NA,intense competition for food and most types,82
NA,"of corals will be eaten, including species that",82
NA,the crown-of-thorns starfish would usually,82
NA,ignore. They can eat so much that they can,82
NA,reduce the hard coral cover from its typical,82
NA,25 per cent to 40 per cent composition of the,82
NA,reef surface to less than one per cent in a,82
NA,very short period. Such a reef can take 10,82
NA,years or more to recover. The rate of recov-,82
NA,ery of reefs from the crown-of-thorns star-,82
NA,"fish, however, depends on many factors, in-",82
NA,cluding the rate of recruitment of corals to,82
NA,the reef and the impacts of cyclones and run-,82
NA,off from the land.,82
NA,We hear quite often these days about the,82
NA,"issue of climate change, but let us talk about",82
NA,"the crown-of-thorns starfish, a practical eve-",82
NA,ryday problem that we can actually influence,82
NA,more readily. While the global community,82
NA,still debates what actions need to be taken to,82
NA,address issues arising from warming ocean,82
NA,"temperatures, the case study of the increasing",82
NA,frequency of crown-of-thorns starfish out-,82
NA,breaks provides an opportunity for Australia,82
NA,to do something practical to conserve what is,82
NA,clearly a critical area to Australia's tourism,82
NA,industry and the North Queensland Indige-,82
NA,nous communities.,82
NA,Increased human use of coastal zones has,82
NA,amplified the amount of nutrients flowing to,82
NA,the sea and has resulted in an increase in,82
NA,food sources for larvae of the crown-of-,82
NA,"thorns starfish, which in turn has led to in-",82
NA,creased numbers of adult starfish. This then,82
NA,clearly results in outbreaks. Run-off to the,82
NA,ocean naturally occurs whenever it rains and,82
NA,higher nutrient levels are typical after high,82
NA,"rainfall, especially after an extended dry",82
NA,"riod or drought. However, the amount of nu-",82
NA,trients reaching the reef lagoons from the,82
NA,adjacent rivers has increased several-fold,82
NA,since European settlement. Research from,82
NA,the CRC Reef Research Centre has indicated,82
NA,that an increased nutrient load could improve,82
NA,the survival of the crown-of-thorns starfish,82
NA,"larvae, which could possibly cause outbreaks",82
NA,or increase the frequency or intensity of out-,82
NA,breaks. Recent mathematical models that,82
NA,mimic a tenfold increase in larval survival,82
NA,show that this would lead very quickly to,82
NA,more frequent outbreaks of crown-of-thorns,82
NA,starfish.,82
NA,There are real opportunities here for Aus-,82
NA,"tralia to demonstrate a practical, strong and",82
NA,long-term commitment to not only the envi-,82
NA,"ronment but also Australian jobs, export",82
NA,earnings and Indigenous culture by address-,82
NA,"ing the issue of water quality, including the",82
NA,"issue of nutrient run-off which contributes,",82
NA,"unfortunately, to this challenge to the Austra-",82
NA,"lian tourism industry. Water, sediment and",82
NA,nutrients drain into the reef's heritage area,82
NA,"from a catchment of 424,000 square kilome-",82
NA,tres. The catchment covers 25 per cent of,82
NA,Queensland and comprises 38 drainage ba-,82
NA,sins both on the mainland and the large is-,82
NA,"lands. Added to this, almost one million peo-",82
NA,ple live within the catchment area with,82
NA,nearly half of the population living in six,82
NA,"coastal cities, indicating significant density",82
NA,in these cities.,82
NA,"Further, open range cattle grazing and",82
NA,sugarcane farming is the major land use in,82
NA,"the catchment, particularly along the water-",82
NA,ways on fertile coastal floodplains. Farming,82
NA,in the catchment is supported by extensive,82
NA,"use of fertilisers, most of which are applied",82
NA,to sugarcane crops on the coastal plains.,82
NA,"Over the last 50 years, fertiliser use has risen",82
NA,with the expansion of the industry and its,82
NA,increased application in the farming commu-,82
NA,"nity. Most of the added fertiliser, specifically",82
NA,"pe- phosphorous, becomes bound to the soil and",82
NA,is transported with eroded soil into the wa-,82
NA,terways. The nature of these fertiliser,82
NA,bounded soil sediments means that they can,83
NA,carry toxic materials further than they would,83
NA,if they travelled alone. The issue of run-off,83
NA,complex and is influenced by rainfall events,83
NA,"and that, in turn, affects the drift of plumes",83
NA,that can result in degradation of the reef by,83
NA,increasing water turbidity and reducing the,83
NA,amount of light that reaches the coral.,83
NA,Still more research needs to be done to,83
NA,comprehensively understand the cumulative,83
NA,effect of all these factors on the health of,83
NA,"reef, and we need greater leadership at fed-",83
NA,eral level to make this happen. This bill pro-,83
NA,vides for greater powers for the Minister for,83
NA,"the Environment and Water Resources, and I",83
NA,would encourage the minister to make use of,83
NA,these powers in addressing what I regard as,83
NA,issues very critical to the future of the reef.,83
NA,There is also an opportunity for the Com-,83
NA,monwealth to demonstrate leadership in ad-,83
NA,dressing the issue of outbreaks of the crown-,83
NA,of-thorns starfish on the reef. Managing the,83
NA,starfish is a labour-intensive and expensive,83
NA,exercise and is only practical in small ar-,83
NA,eas-often the areas that are frequented by,83
NA,tourists who expect a high cover of coral.,83
NA,The industry accepts that it is impossible to,83
NA,eradicate the starfish from reefs where they,83
NA,"are in outbreak densities, but there is still a",83
NA,lot more that could and should be done.,83
NA,Some tourism operators in the Cairns re-,83
NA,"gion, for the purposes of protecting the fu-",83
NA,"ture of the region and their own operations,",83
NA,"invest up to $300,000 a year in crown-of-",83
NA,thorns starfish control programs. During ac-,83
NA,"tive outbreaks, operators may need to re-",83
NA,move 200-500 starfish every day in an effort,83
NA,to keep selected sites free of starfish. Since,83
NA,"February 2002, the Association of Marine",83
NA,Park Tourism Operators-with whom I met,83
NA,recently-have been running a starfish con-,83
NA,trol team that has conducted control efforts at,83
NA,169 sites on 57 reefs. They are clearly pull-,83
NA,"ing their weight, but they expect more assis-",83
NA,tance from the Australian government. It is,83
NA,"estimated that over 100,000 crown-of-thorns",83
NA,is starfish have been removed as a result of this,83
NA,exercise. This number of starfish could con-,83
NA,"servatively consume 50,000 square metres of",83
NA,coral per night.,83
NA,"However, there have also been episodes",83
NA,where the number of crown-of-thorns star-,83
NA,fish has been so great that the in-house pro-,83
NA,grams have been unable to maintain sustain-,83
NA,the able levels on-site. To give you some idea of,83
NA,how serious and widespread these outbreaks,83
NA,"can be, the current starfish outbreak on the",83
NA,reef occurred in the northern waters of the,83
NA,reef in 2000 and has progressively moved,83
NA,"south. Tourism operators, in partnership with",83
NA,"the Queensland government, applied for",83
NA,funding from the Commonwealth for a con-,83
NA,trol program when the outbreak occurred in,83
NA,"2000. Some 18 months later, in 2002, the",83
NA,"funding was made available-if anything,",83
NA,"too late. By this time, the outbreak was well",83
NA,established and covered an area from Lizard,83
NA,Island in the north to Bait Reef in the Whit-,83
NA,"sundays. Further funding has been sought,",83
NA,"granted and expended; however, the future of",83
NA,the control program now remains unclear.,83
NA,That is something to which both sides of,83
NA,politics have to give serious and urgent con-,83
NA,sideration.,83
NA,When I state on behalf of the opposition,83
NA,that there is a real opportunity for the Com-,83
NA,"monwealth to demonstrate leadership, the",83
NA,outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish are,83
NA,"a case in point. It is a practical, realisable",83
NA,challenge to both sides of government. One,83
NA,has to ask why there was a delay of 18,83
NA,months in providing the necessary funds. We,83
NA,have to have a contingency process which,83
NA,enables a draw-down of the funds when the,83
NA,problem occurs. This was a costly delay that,83
NA,enabled the outbreak to become well estab-,83
NA,"lished, and the outbreak now requires more",83
NA,funding and more labour to control. There is,83
NA,"a clear need, in actively and effectively man-",83
NA,"aging the marine reef park, for consideration",84
NA,to be given to establishing a contingency,84
NA,fund that allows the industry to access funds,84
NA,promptly when it needs them so that it can,84
NA,curb the extent of any outbreak.,84
NA,The opposition have long been critical of,84
NA,the lack of federal leadership when it comes,84
NA,"to the tourism industry, and this is another",84
NA,case in point. The marine tourism industry,84
NA,"employs over 60,000 people in the cities and",84
NA,towns along the reef and is critical to the,84
NA,Queensland and Australian economies. Why,84
NA,"then have we let, for five long years, an",84
NA,dated and inadequate management system,84
NA,stay in place?,84
NA,"The key amendments of this bill, as result-",84
NA,"ing from the Uhrig review, do allow for some",84
NA,improvements to the management of the ma-,84
NA,rine park. There are also some amendments,84
NA,that should be welcomed with caution. Not,84
NA,allowing automatic representation from,84
NA,Queensland or the Indigenous community is,84
NA,a cause for concern. There are also areas not,84
NA,addressed through these amendments that,84
NA,need attention if we are to conserve our,84
NA,"Great Barrier Reef effectively into the future,",84
NA,not just to allow international visitors to,84
NA,mire its beauty but for our children and,84
NA,grandchildren to enjoy.,84
NA,"I commend the bill to the House and, in",84
NA,"doing so, indicate our support for this second",84
NA,"reading amendment. As I have indicated, this",84
NA,is an exceptionally important bill. It is about,84
NA,the future of the tourism industry and jobs,84
NA,for many Australians. I commend the bill and,84
NA,the second reading amendment to the House.,84
Dr SOUTHCOTT ,Boothby) (1.57,84
NA,pm)-In speaking to the Great Barrier Reef,84
NA,"Marine Park Amendment Bill 2007, it seems",84
NA,an appropriate time to remember that it was,84
NA,the Fraser government in 1979 which first,84
NA,established the Great Barrier Reef Marine,84
NA,Park on the Capricornia section of the reef. It,84
NA,was also the Fraser government which pro-,84
NA,hibited exploration and drilling for petroleum,84
NA,in the area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine,84
NA,"Park. In 1981, the Great Barrier Reef was",84
NA,inscribed on the World Heritage List. These,84
NA,were all actions of a previous Liberal gov-,84
NA,ernment and a demonstration that we have,84
NA,had a good strong track record on the envi-,84
NA,ronment but have always been able to bal-,84
NA,ance it with other things. The bill that we are,84
NA,considering provides for a management plan,84
NA,which will incorporate the needs of tour-,84
NA,ism-there is $5 billion in tourism to the,84
NA,out- Great Barrier Reef-but also the needs of,84
NA,fisheries in that area.,84
NA,The Great Barrier Reef was inscribed on,84
NA,the list of World Heritage areas in 1981. It,84
NA,"became the largest area of World Heritage,",84
NA,covering some 35 million hectares on the,84
NA,north-east continental shelf of Australia. It is,84
NA,"the world's most extensive coral reef system,",84
NA,yet the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage,84
NA,area consists of much more than just reefs. It,84
NA,is an outstanding representation of a number,84
NA,"of significant, ongoing ecological and bio-",84
NA,"logical processes. The area consists of 2,800",84
NA,"reefs, ranging in size from one to 100,000",84
NA,"adhectares, and provides habitats for many dif-",84
NA,ferent forms of marine life-including spe-,84
NA,"cies like the dugong, considered to be en-",84
NA,dangered on an international scale.,84
NA,"The reef provides food sources for fish,",84
NA,"sea urchins and molluscs, is a nesting area",84
NA,for endangered turtles and a breeding area,84
NA,for humpbacked whales. According to the,84
NA,Executive Director of the Association of Ma-,84
NA,"rine Park Tourism Operators, these are some",84
NA,of the attractions that have led to the creation,84
NA,of a $5 billion reef based tourism industry.,84
NA,So there are very strong environmental rea-,84
NA,sons for the protection of the reef. But there,84
NA,are also massive industries around it-the,84
NA,tourism and fishing industries-and it is very,84
NA,important to balance all of those areas.,84
NA,Since the election of the Howard govern-,85
NA,"ment, the protected zones within the Great",85
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park have increased,85
NA,from 4½ per cent to 33.3 per cent.,85
The SPEAKER,"Order! It being 2 pm,",85
NA,the debate is interrupted in accordance with,85
NA,standing order 97. The debate may be re-,85
NA,sumed at a later hour and the member will,85
NA,have leave to continue speaking when the,85
NA,debate is resumed.,85
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,85
NA,Budget 2007-08,85
Mr RUDD ,2.00 pm)-My question is to,85
NA,the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister,85
NA,to OECD research that concludes that the,85
NA,earlier governments invest in education the,85
NA,better the return for the child and the econ-,85
NA,"omy. Prime Minister, given these findings,",85
NA,"why does Australia, even after last night's",85
NA,"budget, still rank last in the OECD on spend-",85
NA,ing on early childhood education?,85
Mr HOWARD,I certainly agree that,85
NA,early intervention not only in a child's educa-,85
NA,tion but also in assisting parents is highly,85
NA,desirable. I think the Leader of the Opposi-,85
NA,tion would be aware of some of the discus-,85
NA,sions that took place at COAG on this mat-,85
NA,"ter, and I think the Leader of the Opposition",85
NA,would also be aware of the historic responsi-,85
NA,bility under our arrangements with state gov-,85
NA,ernments for early childhood education.,85
NA,Budget 2007-08,85
Mr CIOBO ,2.01 pm)-My question is,85
NA,addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer,85
NA,outline to the House how the budget an-,85
NA,nounced last night will strengthen the Aus-,85
NA,tralian economy to deal with the challenges,85
NA,of the future?,85
Mr COSTELLO,I thank the honour-,85
NA,able member for Moncrieff for his question.,85
NA,The budget which the government an-,85
NA,nounced last night will invest for Australia's,85
NA,"future. It will invest in higher education,",85
NA,an innovative fund called the Higher Educa-,85
NA,tion Endowment Fund which will set up for a,85
NA,generation investment in higher education. It,85
NA,will give incentives for apprentices to take,85
NA,up firstand second-year apprenticeships in,85
NA,skills shortage areas. It will improve primary,85
NA,education. It will grow the capacity of the,85
NA,"workforce. By improving child care, we will",85
NA,be able to give encouragement to those,85
NA,mothers who want to return to the workforce,85
NA,to do so.,85
NA,Last night I announced income tax cuts,85
NA,"for every Australian, which will increase the",85
NA,rewards a little for skill and effort. Our econ-,85
NA,omy has come through a period of continu-,85
NA,"ous economic growth, the like of which we",85
NA,have never had before in Australia. In order,85
NA,to keep Australia strong we now need to,85
NA,boost the capacity of the Australian econ-,85
NA,omy. We will do that with an investment in,85
NA,"skills, we will do that with an investment in",85
NA,"education, we will do that with a better tax",85
NA,"system, we will do that with investment in",85
NA,"roads, we will do that with investment in rail,",85
NA,we will do that with our education endow-,85
NA,ment fund and we will do that with the Fu-,85
NA,ture Fund. This is a budget which locks in,85
NA,"the benefits and the hard work of the past,",85
NA,and it invests for a future which our country,85
NA,deserves and wants to have.,85
NA,Budget 2007-08,85
Mr RUDD ,2.03 pm)-My question is to,85
NA,the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister,85
NA,confirm that Budget Paper No. 1 discloses,85
NA,that education spending as a proportion of,85
NA,total government expenditure will fall from,85
NA,7.7 per cent in 2005-06 to 7.4 per cent in,85
NA,2010-11? How can this be a budget about the,85
NA,future when the government's investment in,85
NA,"education, as a proportion of total spending,",85
NA,falls over the next four years?,85
Mr HOWARD,The basis on which the,85
NA,Leader of the Opposition asked the question,85
NA,"with is wrong because, whereas some years ago",85
NA,Austudy assistance was included in the edu-,86
NA,"cation provision, it is no longer",86
NA,that gives a radically different outcome.,86
NA,"While I am on my feet, can I remind the",86
NA,"Leader of the Opposition that, when the gov-",86
NA,"ernment came to power, it inherited a $10",86
NA,billion annual deficit and a $96 billion debt.,86
NA,"As a consequence of that, it was necessary",86
NA,for us to make very significant spending re-,86
NA,ductions in our first budget. I can well re-,86
NA,member that at the time I resolved that the,86
NA,only areas that would be quarantined from,86
NA,expenditure reductions were those relating to,86
NA,essential income support and defence and,86
NA,"that every other area of the budget, because",86
NA,of the profligacy and the irresponsibility of,86
NA,"the Australian Labor Party, had to bear its",86
NA,share of cuts. So that explains why some,86
NA,decisions were made in 1996.,86
NA,But can I just say to the Leader of the Op-,86
NA,position that this groundbreaking historic,86
NA,commitment of $5 billion into the Higher,86
NA,Education Endowment Fund represents a,86
NA,genuine education revolution. This is an edu-,86
NA,cation revolution of which this country can,86
NA,be very proud. It reaches not only into uni-,86
NA,versities but into technical education and,86
NA,schools. The Commonwealth is picking up,86
NA,the ball dropped in many areas by state gov-,86
NA,ernments.,86
NA,I say to the Leader of the Opposition that,86
NA,the parents of Australia actually believe,86
NA,"when their children leave school, they ought",86
NA,to be able to read and write and add up. They,86
NA,think those basics of education ought to be,86
NA,"delivered by the education systems, which",86
NA,are the responsibility of the states. We are,86
NA,only too happy to plug the gaps that are,86
NA,emerging. That is why we have introduced,86
NA,this outstanding across-the-board voucher,86
NA,system-a voucher of $700 a year to address,86
NA,literacy and numeracy requirements. It is a,86
NA,wonderful provision and it is a wonderful,86
NA,earnest of this government's long-term,86
NA,commitment to the education future for all,86
NA,"the case, and Australians.",86
NA,Economy,86
Mrs MARKUS ,2.06 pm)-My question,86
NA,is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the,86
NA,Prime Minister aware of claims that the Aus-,86
NA,tralian economy is strong only because of the,86
NA,mining boom? Are these claims correct?,86
Mr HOWARD,It so happens I am,86
NA,aware of those claims. Those claims are,86
NA,made every day by the Leader of the Opposi-,86
NA,tion and by the member for Lilley. They are,86
NA,made every day by people on the front bench,86
NA,of the Labor Party. It is very interesting that,86
NA,that question has been asked of me by the,86
NA,"member for Greenway, and the last time I",86
NA,checked there were no iron ore mines in,86
NA,Greenway. The last time I checked there,86
NA,were no major coal deposits in Blacktown.,86
NA,The last time I checked there was no source,86
NA,of gas in the western suburbs of Sydney.,86
NA,Government members interjecting-,86
Mr HOWARD,You know the gas I am,86
NA,referring to.,86
NA,Mr Costello-Natural gas.,86
Mr HOWARD,Natural gas. It is very,86
NA,"interesting that, despite the absence of all of",86
NA,"those wonderful commodities, the unem-",86
NA,ployment rate in Greenway was 8.8 per cent,86
NA,in March 1996 and it is now 4.2 per cent.,86
NA,"that, What the Leader of the Opposition would",86
NA,have us believe is that all of that is due to,86
NA,what is happening in Western Australia and,86
NA,"Queensland-that it has all been transported,",86
NA,"courtesy of I do not know what, over to the",86
NA,western suburbs of Sydney.,86
NA,The truth is that most sections of the Aus-,86
NA,tralian economy have undergone massive,86
NA,growth over the last 10 years. I point out to,86
NA,the House that the December quarter national,86
NA,accounts show that in the year to December,86
NA,2006 mining output grew by 5.8 per cent in,86
NA,real terms compared to 8.8 per cent in con-,86
NA,"struction, 7.4 per cent in transport and stor-",87
NA,"age, and 6.7 per cent in communication ser-",87
NA,vices. The latest statistics of the Australian,87
NA,Taxation Office show that the fastest growth,87
NA,in company income was in fact in finance,87
NA,"and insurance, which comprised 23.7 per",87
NA,cent of company income in 2003-04 com-,87
NA,pared to 25.4 per cent in 2004-05. There is,87
NA,no doubt that it is a great time to be in min-,87
NA,ing in Australia. There is no doubt that the,87
NA,mining boom is contributing massively to the,87
NA,strength of the Australian economy. But it is,87
NA,totally fallacious to claim that the only rea-,87
NA,son we are now doing well is that providence,87
NA,gave us a wonderful array of resources that,87
NA,are in great demand around the world. The,87
NA,Australian economy has performed strongly,87
NA,right across the board. Mining has made a,87
NA,great contribution to that.,87
NA,"On the subject of mining, there is a risk",87
NA,the strength of the mining industry in,87
NA,"lia. There is a real risk, and I reminded the",87
NA,people of Western Australia of this when I,87
NA,spoke on Western Australian radio. I pointed,87
NA,out that the real risk to the mining boom is,87
NA,Labor's industrial relations policy. The real,87
NA,risk to the mining boom is the abolition of,87
NA,AWAs. The real risk to the mining boom is to,87
NA,bring back the supremacy of collective bar-,87
NA,gaining across all the mining operations of,87
NA,this country. The real risk to the mining in-,87
NA,"dustry is that this country, once again, if a",87
NA,"Labor government were to be elected, would",87
NA,be burdened with an industrial relations pol-,87
NA,icy not serving the interests of the mining,87
NA,"industry, not serving the interests of workers",87
NA,"in the mining industry, not serving the inter-",87
NA,ests of the future prosperity of our nation but,87
NA,rather serving the interests of union power.,87
NA,That is why if we worry about the mining,87
NA,"industry, if we care about the mining indus-",87
NA,"try, we will understand that the greatest",87
NA,threat to the mining industry is the election,87
NA,of a government with the policies of the Aus-,87
NA,tralian Labor Party.,87
NA,Budget 2007-08,87
Mr SWAN ,2.10 pm)-My question is di-,87
NA,"rected to the Treasurer. Is it the case, Treas-",87
NA,"urer, that over the last 11 years government",87
NA,investment in education has fallen from two,87
NA,per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to 1.6 per cent of,87
NA,"GDP, even after the measures announced in",87
NA,last night's budget?,87
Mr COSTELLO,"As it turns out, that is",87
NA,not the case. I must say there are traps for,87
NA,young players.,87
NA,Government members interjecting-,87
Mr COSTELLO,"I am sorry, there are",87
NA,traps for middle-aged players. I have heard,87
NA,this being recounted on radio over and over,87
NA,again. Let me put the facts on the table. Aus-,87
NA,tralian government expenditure on education,87
NA,has increased by 38 per cent in real terms,87
NA,to from 1996 to 2007. What the honourable,87
NA,Austra- member for Lilley has been unable to,87
NA,"fathom, and the Prime Minister explained it",87
NA,to him in the answer to the last question on,87
NA,"this, is that Austudy was absorbed into Youth",87
NA,Allowance in the 1998-99 budget and there-,87
NA,after Austudy-which was about $1.5 billion,87
NA,and had previously been classified as an edu-,87
NA,cation outlay-was classified as family and,87
NA,community services outlay. If you add in that,87
NA,$1.4 billion that moved classifications then,87
NA,in fact you do not get that decline at all. A,87
NA,modicum of research would have actually,87
NA,disclosed this to the opposition. But the op-,87
NA,position is not worried about research; the,87
NA,opposition is more worried about tomorrow's,87
NA,headline.,87
NA,Mr Tanner interjecting-,87
The SPEAKER,Order! The member for,87
NA,Melbourne.,87
Mr COSTELLO,The claims made,87
NA,against the budget have gotten more and,87
NA,more shrill as the last 24 hours have pro-,87
NA,ceeded. First of all we were warned that we,87
NA,should not cut taxes; and now these are tax,87
NA,cuts that were required for working people.,88
NA,We were warned that we had to invest in,88
NA,education; and then when we invest in the,88
NA,biggest build-up of education ever it is not in,88
NA,the right areas. We were warned that we had,88
NA,to have investment in road and rail; and,88
NA,when we have investment in road and rail it,88
NA,is in the wrong areas. If you want to run a $1,88
NA,"trillion economy, you have to get up early",88
NA,and you have to do some work-and that is,88
NA,what the member for Lilley cannot do.,88
NA,Budget 2007-08,88
Mr BAKER ,2.14 pm)-My question is,88
NA,addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treas-,88
NA,urer outline to the House the benefits to Aus-,88
NA,tralian taxpayers announced in the budget,88
NA,last night that derive from 11 years of careful,88
NA,economic management?,88
Mr COSTELLO,I thank the honour-,88
NA,able member for his question. Last night I,88
NA,announced cuts to income tax for all Austra-,88
NA,lians-for all Australians that pay income,88
NA,tax. We will do that in two stages. In the first,88
NA,"stage, we will lift the threshold for paying",88
NA,"30c in the dollar from $25,000 to $30,000,",88
NA,and in the second stage we will lift the,88
NA,"threshold for the 40c rate from $75,000 to",88
NA,"$80,000 and the threshold for the 45c rate",88
NA,"from $150,000 to $180,000. All Australians",88
NA,get an income tax cut as a consequence of,88
NA,that. For those that are on average wages-,88
NA,"between $40,000 and $50,000-this will be a",88
NA,tax cut of $16 a week. That will be helpful,88
NA,"for families, it will improve work incentives",88
NA,and it is consistent with our policy.,88
NA,The shell press release that the Labor,88
NA,Party delivered to all its candidates has been,88
NA,"sent to me, and I will table it in a moment. I",88
NA,am pleased to see that it starts off as follows:,88
NA,Federal Labor Candidate for <Insert Electorate>,88
NA,Mr/ Mrs <Insert Candidate Name> tonight wel-,88
NA,comed tax cuts for working families and carers,88
NA,That is good. That is in the shell press release,88
NA,that the Labor Party has put out. It continues:,88
NA,"“Make no mistake, all <Insert Electorate> fami-",88
NA,lies deserve to share in the profits from the min-,88
NA,ing boom-a boom ...,88
NA,This reads like a text from the Leader of the,88
NA,Opposition on radio this morning-he,88
NA,probably was reading this out. What is the,88
NA,name of his electorate? Insert name here-K.,88
NA,"Rudd, electorate Griffith. It continues:",88
NA,"“Their inclusion in tonight's budget is welcome”,",88
NA,<Insert Candidate Name> said.,88
NA,Mr/ Mrs <Insert Candidate Name> said the 2007,88
NA,"Federal Budget was a cynical, pre-election",88
NA,budget.,88
NA,How do you like that? You have got a cyni-,88
NA,cal shell press release which accuses the,88
NA,government of cynicism. You have got to say,88
NA,it has chutzpah. As George Burns famously,88
NA,"said, ‘Sincerity is everything. If you can fake",88
NA,"that, you've got it made.' Cynicism is every-",88
NA,"thing, and, if you can cynically accuse some-",88
NA,"one of cynicism, you have got it made. There",88
NA,is the shell press release. That is about all the,88
NA,work that the Labor Party did on the federal,88
NA,budget. I table it and will take further ques-,88
NA,tions from that shell press release.,88
NA,Budget 2007-08,88
Mr RUDD ,2.18 pm)-My question,88
NA,again is to the Prime Minister. It refers to my,88
NA,earlier question where I asked the Prime,88
NA,Minister to confirm whether Budget Paper,88
NA,No. 1 disclosed that education spending as a,88
NA,proportion of total government expenditure,88
NA,will fall from 7.7 per cent in 2005-06 to 7.4,88
NA,"per cent in 2010-11. Prime Minister, I refer",88
NA,to your answer to my question where you,88
NA,said that it was based on the wrong premise,88
NA,because it failed to take into account the dif-,88
NA,ferent treatment of Austudy back in the late,88
NA,nineties-which had nothing to do with my,88
NA,"question at all. Prime Minister, will you in",88
NA,"fact answer the question I asked you, which",88
NA,... is a future comparison about your govern-,88
NA,"ment's commitment to education outlays, not",88
NA,the answer that you gave me before which is,89
NA,about the past.,89
Mr HOWARD,By reminding the,89
NA,Leader of the Opposition of what I said in,89
NA,answer to his first question-it has been,89
NA,validated and supported by what the Treas-,89
NA,urer has said-the truth is that the provision,89
NA,made for education in this year's budget,89
NA,represents a historic turning point in support10-year,89
NA,ing all levels of education.,89
NA,Budget 2007-08,89
Mr NEVILLE ,2.19 pm)-My question,89
NA,is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister,89
NA,and the Minister for Transport and Regional,89
NA,Services. Will the Deputy Prime Minister,89
NA,inform the House how the budget will de-,89
NA,liver the infrastructure that Australia needs,89
NA,into the 21st century? How does this com-,89
NA,pare with previous funding?,89
Mr VAILE,I thank the honourable,89
NA,member for Hinkler for his question. As he,89
NA,has been for some considerable time the,89
NA,chair of the House of Representatives trans-,89
NA,"port committee, I know that he takes a great",89
NA,deal of interest in investment in transport,89
NA,infrastructure in Australia for today and into,89
NA,the future.,89
NA,"As the Treasurer has indicated, the budget",89
NA,is about locking in future prosperity in the,89
NA,Australian economy and capitalising on the,89
NA,work that has been done in this country over,89
NA,the last 11 years. There is no aspect of the,89
NA,budget that is more important than the in-,89
NA,vestment in future transport infrastructure in,89
NA,"Australia, particularly in our roads and rail",89
NA,networks. Giving certainty in all the areas,89
NA,that we participate in funding and giving,89
NA,"certainty to funding partners, both at state",89
NA,"and local government level, is well into the",89
NA,future. Last night's announcement in the,89
NA,budget by the Treasurer that we would be,89
NA,committing $22.3 billion to the second stage,89
NA,of AusLink funding for road and rail infra-,89
NA,structure in Australia is a historic increase,89
NA,and a historic commitment to that infrastruc-,89
NA,ture investment in Australia.,89
NA,We have invested $15.8 billion in AusLink,89
NA,"1 and $22.3 billion in AusLink 2, if you want",89
NA,to call it that. A 41 per cent increase in Aus-,89
NA,Link 2 will take the total 10-year investment,89
NA,of this government in land transport infra-,89
NA,structure to $38 billion-$38 billion over a,89
NA,period. Part of the budget an-,89
NA,nouncement includes $15.8 billion on the,89
NA,national roads network-significant funding,89
NA,to start planning and detail work on rail in-,89
NA,frastructure in Australia. We are already in-,89
NA,vesting and we need to continue to invest.,89
NA,We need to continue the economic growth,89
NA,that is delivering the prosperity that we have,89
NA,in this country and we need to lock that in,89
NA,into the future.,89
NA,"Put very simply, the programs that are",89
NA,contained within AusLink build better high-,89
NA,"ways, safer highways and more efficient",89
NA,highways across the nation. They improve,89
NA,"local roads, so mums and dads taking their",89
NA,kids to school are much safer. They build,89
NA,safer roads in local communities. They build,89
NA,road and rail systems that will be more effi-,89
NA,cient in getting our exports to marketplaces,89
NA,across the world. These are serious invest-,89
NA,ments that secure the future prosperity of the,89
NA,"Australian economy. As I indicated, we have",89
NA,funding partners in this. We have arrange-,89
NA,ments with the states and with local govern-,89
NA,ment. We expect those arrangements to share,89
NA,the costs and the risks. Commonwealth tax-,89
NA,payers are not going to carry the burden of,89
NA,all the risks. We need to engage with the,89
NA,states. We need to have a serious discussion,89
NA,with them about how this $22 billion will be,89
NA,delivered in the future.,89
NA,There have been some very interesting,89
NA,comments on last night's budget from some,89
NA,interested observers-and from some who,89
NA,have not always been supporters of this gov-,89
NA,"ernment, I might add. The first quote is from",89
NA,a press release from the NRMA in New,90
NA,"South Wales. The president of the NRMA,",90
NA,"Mr Alan Evans, said:",90
NA,This strong investment in Australia's road net-,90
NA,work is key to sustaining a growing economy.,90
NA,He went on to say:,90
NA,"Tonight's budget is great news for motorists,",90
NA,businesses and industry.,90
NA,The Australian Trucking Association-,90
NA,obviously an organisation that is very inter-,90
NA,ested in the infrastructure investments of the,90
NA,future in Australia-said:,90
NA,We applaud the Australian government on its,90
NA,commitment to land transport.,90
NA,It went on to say:,90
NA,This is a clear sign the Australian government,90
NA,listening.,90
NA,That is absolutely right. We are working with,90
NA,industry; we are consulting industry. We are,90
NA,also working with communities to address,90
NA,their infrastructure needs in their local areas.,90
NA,"I say again: this investment in infrastructure,",90
NA,"in the future of Australia, is all about locking",90
NA,in the future growth and the future prosperity,90
NA,that we expect to see in the Australian econ-,90
NA,omy.,90
The SPEAKER,In calling the Leader of,90
NA,"the Opposition, I remind him that he should",90
NA,not use the pronouns ‘you' or ‘your' in his,90
NA,questions.,90
NA,Budget 2007-08,90
Mr RUDD ,2.24 pm)-My question is,90
NA,again to the Prime Minister. It refers to my,90
NA,two previous questions of the Prime Minis-,90
NA,ter. It relates to the government's outlays on,90
NA,education as a proportion of total govern-,90
NA,"ment outlays, and it compares government",90
NA,outlays in 2005-06 against those in the gov-,90
NA,ernment's own budget papers for 2010.,90
NA,Again I ask the Prime Minister: will the,90
NA,Prime Minister make reference to his own,90
NA,"Budget Paper No. 1 and, to table 3 in state-",90
NA,"ment 6 of the budget papers, and confirm to",90
NA,the parliament whether or not outlays on,90
NA,education as a proportion of total outlays go,90
NA,down over that period?,90
Mr HOWARD,I always analyse what,90
NA,"the Leader of the Opposition puts to me, but",90
NA,nothing can gainsay the fact that this educa-,90
NA,tion announcement made by the government,90
NA,has been applauded across all sectors of edu-,90
NA,cation. Some of the vice-chancellors have,90
NA,said that it is far ahead of anything they ever,90
NA,dreamt of receiving. The truth is that the,90
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, who has talked",90
NA,"long and hard about an education revolution,",90
NA,now finds himself in the embarrassing posi-,90
NA,tion that this government has done far more,90
NA,for education than he has ever promised to,90
NA,is do. That is the dilemma of the Leader of the,90
NA,Opposition.,90
NA,Budget 2007-08,90
Mr TOLLNER ,2.25 pm)-My question,90
NA,"is addressed to the Minister for Education,",90
NA,Science and Training. Would the minister,90
NA,inform the House of what the government is,90
NA,doing to ensure universities become truly,90
NA,"world class? Will Charles Darwin University,",90
NA,"the university in my local area, benefit from",90
NA,these initiatives?,90
Ms JULIE BISHOP,I thank the mem-,90
NA,ber for Solomon for his question. I can con-,90
NA,"firm that, last night, the Treasurer announced",90
NA,an unprecedented investment in our universi-,90
NA,ties-a $1.7 billion package of funds for our,90
NA,"universities, plus a $5 billion Higher Educa-",90
NA,tion Endowment Fund. The income from this,90
NA,"fund, which we estimate to be about $300",90
NA,"million a year, will be distributed to universi-",90
NA,ties. They will be able to use this fund to,90
NA,invest in capital works and research facili-,90
NA,ties. We believe that over time all universi-,90
NA,ties in Australia will be able to build world-,90
NA,class facilities so that our students will have,90
NA,the opportunity to study in world-class insti-,90
NA,tutions.,90
NA,Our universities will be able build state-,91
NA,"of-the-art facilities, science blocks, computer",91
NA,"laboratories, libraries and lecture theatres.",91
NA,This will apply to universities across the,91
NA,"country, including universities in the member",91
NA,"for Solomon's electorate, particularly",91
NA,Charles Darwin University. Charles Darwin,91
NA,will also be eligible for a range of other ini-,91
NA,tiatives contained in this higher education,91
NA,package. The raft of reforms will give our,91
NA,"universities the freedom, the flexibility and",91
NA,the funding to manage student demand and,91
NA,to offer courses that students want to study.,91
NA,Last night the Treasurer announced that,91
NA,almost $560 million in additional funds will,91
NA,be available for universities to deliver high-,91
NA,quality courses in areas of national need-in,91
NA,"science, maths, engineering, allied health,",91
NA,"medicine, dentistry, nursing and teaching. I",91
NA,want to point out that our universities will,91
NA,receive more funding for our teaching,91
NA,courses and more funding to improve the,91
NA,practical experience of student teachers so,91
NA,that our universities will be able to produce,91
NA,high-quality teaching graduates for our,91
NA,schools.,91
NA,We are also going on to support teachers,91
NA,in schools. Teachers will be eligible to apply,91
NA,"for Australian government summer schools,",91
NA,where they can upskill their qualifications,91
NA,"and abilities in areas and receive a $5,000",91
NA,bonus on completion. We will also reward,91
NA,schools that make a significant improvement,91
NA,in the literacy and numeracy standards of,91
NA,their students. These schools will be eligible,91
NA,"for rewards of up to $50,000.",91
NA,With a total package of $3.5 billion for,91
NA,"schools and universities, plus the $5 billion",91
NA,"Higher Education Endowment Fund, we",91
NA,have put our schools and universities in a,91
NA,strong position. This was possible only be-,91
NA,cause of the strong economic management of,91
NA,the Howard-Costello government; it was,91
NA,possible only because we had budget sur-,91
NA,pluses. The Labor Party can only dream of,91
NA,coming up with initiatives that put our uni-,91
NA,"versities on a sustainable, long-term footing.",91
NA,This is unprecedented.,91
NA,Budget 2007-08,91
Mr SWAN ,2.29 pm)-My question is di-,91
NA,rected to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer,91
NA,confirm that productivity growth when the,91
NA,coalition took office in 1996 was 3.2 per cent,91
NA,"per annum, at the turn of the decade it was",91
NA,"2.2 per cent per annum, in the Intergenera-",91
NA,tional report it will be just 1.5 per cent this,91
NA,decade and in the budget papers last night it,91
NA,is zero for 2006-07? Doesn't the Treasurer,91
NA,agree that these figures show that the produc-,91
NA,tivity performance of his government is one,91
NA,of abject failure?,91
Mr COSTELLO,I think the record,91
NA,speaks for itself: continuous economic,91
NA,"growth of 3½ per cent per annum, inflation",91
NA,"averaged at 2½ per cent per annum, two mil-",91
NA,"lion additional jobs, unemployment falling",91
NA,"from 8½ per cent to 4½ per cent, interest",91
NA,rates falling from 10½ per cent to eight per,91
NA,"cent, a budget deficit of $10 billion turning",91
NA,"into a budget surplus of $10 billion, $96 bil-",91
NA,"lion worth of debt paid off, $100 billion of",91
NA,superannuation liabilities now provisioned,91
NA,with $50 billion of the Future Fund and an,91
NA,endowment fund that will rebuild Australia's,91
NA,"educational capacity forever. I think that, if",91
NA,Australians look at the record of this gov-,91
NA,ernment and compare it with the record of,91
NA,the predecessor government of the Labor,91
NA,"Party, they will draw their own conclusions.",91
NA,"Having said that, let me make a couple of",91
NA,points in relation to productivity. The first,91
NA,point is that productivity will be enhanced in,91
NA,the Australian economy by a better industrial,91
NA,relations system. There would be nobody in,91
NA,Australia who would believe that by going,91
NA,back to collective bargaining and getting rid,91
NA,of AWAs you would do anything other than,91
NA,detract from productivity. The people who,91
NA,"think that include Sir Rod Eddington, the",92
NA,Labor Party adviser in relation to industrial,92
NA,"relations, the person the Deputy Leader of",92
NA,the Opposition dismissively refers to as ‘an-,92
NA,other voice'-,92
NA,Ms Gillard-Not true!,92
Mr COSTELLO,"Not true? Not true,",92
NA,she says-she says didn't refer to him as,92
NA,‘another voice'. You didn't call him ‘another,92
NA,voice'? We've got that on the record-,92
NA,apparently she did not call him ‘another,92
NA,voice'.,92
NA,Ms Gillard-Get the transcript.,92
Mr COSTELLO,What did you call,92
NA,"him-not a voice at all? All right, we will get",92
NA,the transcript. But there is no need to be,92
NA,"barrassed about it, because this was the first",92
NA,policy that was released by the Rudd opposi-,92
NA,tion. It was something that you were proud,92
NA,of not so long ago. Maybe some realism is,92
NA,"beginning to intervene. I will say, if Labor",92
NA,"embarrassed about its IR policy, that it is a",92
NA,step out of the Stone Age. Let us hope that,92
NA,"embarrassment leads to realisation, that re-",92
NA,alisation leads to change and that change,92
NA,leads to the embracing of AWAs and an in-,92
NA,dustrial relations system that will generate,92
NA,future income for Australia.,92
NA,One of the reasons that productivity in the,92
NA,mining industry at the moment looks as,92
NA,though it has actually turned down is that the,92
NA,mining industry is going through a huge in-,92
NA,vestment phase. If you go through a huge,92
NA,"investment phase, if you are in a phase where",92
NA,large investment of capital is going out be-,92
NA,"fore you get volume, it shows as productivity",92
NA,declining. Does that mean that the mining,92
NA,industry has suddenly become unproductive?,92
NA,"No, it means it is going through a huge in-",92
NA,"vestment cycle which, when it leads to more",92
NA,"volumes, will actually dramatically increase",92
NA,productivity.,92
NA,One of the other reasons you find that at,92
NA,times of full employment you get temporary,92
NA,downturns in productivity is that you begin,92
NA,to bring back into the workforce people who,92
NA,were previously marginalised-people who,92
NA,"have been locked out, people whose skills",92
NA,"are not great. But, as you bring them into the",92
NA,"workforce, as they learn those skills over a",92
NA,"period of time, their productivity matches",92
NA,that of other employees. So you always find,92
NA,that at a time in the cycle when you have,92
NA,near to full employment.,92
NA,"With good industrial relations, with good",92
NA,"investment, as we make sure that we increase",92
NA,"the capacity of the Australian economy, I",92
NA,believe that we have more productivity to,92
NA,unleash in this economy. But I tell you this:,92
NA,we will only unleash productivity in this,92
NA,em- economy if we are flexible and forward look-,92
NA,ing. If we go back to centralised industrial,92
NA,"relations, if we go back to the old conflict",92
NA,between labour and capital that the ACTU,92
NA,and all of their minions in this parliament,92
NA,"is believe in, that will be going back to the 20th",92
NA,"century, the 19th century or worse. We are",92
NA,"about the 21st century, about flexibility. We",92
NA,are the coalition: we build for the future!,92
NA,Budget 2007-08,92
Mr BARTLETT ,2.36 pm)-My ques-,92
NA,tion is addressed to the Minister for Health,92
NA,"and Ageing. Minister, how will chronically",92
NA,ill patients in my electorate benefit from last,92
NA,night's budget initiatives?,92
Mr ABBOTT,I thank the member for,92
NA,Macquarie for his question. The 2007-08,92
NA,budget was certainly another very good,92
NA,budget for health. It will be very good for the,92
NA,people of Australia. It will be very good for,92
NA,"the people of Macquarie, thanks in part to the",92
NA,new dental school that will be established at,92
NA,Charles Sturt University-which I believe is,92
NA,"already being called, in some local circles,",92
NA,the Kerry Bartlett dental school. It is a well-,92
NA,deserved title!,92
NA,A government member-Not the Tony,92
NA,Abbott dental school?,92
Mr ABBOTT,"No, not the Tony Abbott",93
NA,dental school; not even the Peter Costello,93
NA,dental school-the Kerry Bartlett dental,93
NA,school! I have to say that the new measures,93
NA,in last night's budget are possible only be-,93
NA,cause of the great economic management,93
NA,that has been delivered to this country by the,93
NA,Treasurer and the Prime Minister. New,93
NA,measures in last night's budget will add $4.6,93
NA,billion to federal government health spend-,93
NA,ing. They will take total health expenditure,93
NA,"to $52 billion next year, and they will take",93
NA,health spending as a percentage of total fed-,93
NA,eral government spending to 22 per cent.,93
NA,That is up from just 14 per cent back in,93
NA,1996. But we are not just spending more,93
NA,money; we are getting better results. Accord-,93
NA,ing to the Australian Institute of Health and,93
NA,"Welfare, since 1996 there has been a three-",93
NA,year increase in the life expectancy of aver-,93
NA,age Australian males and a two-year increase,93
NA,in the life expectancy of females. That is be-,93
NA,cause of the sensible investment of this gov-,93
NA,ernment in better health services.,93
NA,It was a particularly good budget for peo-,93
NA,ple with chronic disease. In addition to care,93
NA,"plans from their GPs, people with multiple",93
NA,conditions will soon benefit from longer,93
NA,"consultations with specialist physicians, and",93
NA,that measure is estimated to cost some $291,93
NA,"million. But even more importantly, for peo-",93
NA,ple with chronic conditions whose poor oral,93
NA,"health is impacting on their general health,",93
NA,there is now greatly expanded access to,93
NA,Medicare funded dentistry. Instead of just,93
NA,"three consultations a year, under Medicare",93
NA,those patients will be eligible for an initial,93
NA,"consultation and up to $2,000 worth of sub-",93
NA,sequent treatment a year.,93
NA,We are not relieving the states of their,93
NA,sponsibility for public dentistry but we will,93
NA,not leave people in health crisis. Many of the,93
NA,"650,000 people on those public dental wait-",93
NA,ing lists will be eligible for a team care plan.,93
NA,My message to them is this: the Howard,93
NA,government will not let you down. It is a,93
NA,tribute to the way the Treasurer has managed,93
NA,health that it was only after question time,93
NA,began that we finally heard from the member,93
NA,"for Gellibrand who, after two o'clock, finally",93
NA,surfaced with a press release that said: ‘Den-,93
NA,"tal program lacks bite.' Well, I tell you what:",93
NA,Medicare has a lot more bite than ever be-,93
NA,fore; it has a lot more bite than it ever had,93
NA,when Labor was in charge. The Howard,93
NA,"government is proving by its actions, not just",93
NA,"by its words, that it is the best friend-the",93
NA,very best friend-that Medicare has ever,93
NA,had.,93
NA,Budget 2007-08,93
Mr SWAN ,"2.40 pm)- Mr Speaker, my",93
NA,question is to the Prime Minister. How can,93
NA,the Prime Minister claim that this is an edu-,93
NA,cation budget when it has no plans to under-,93
NA,pin education through the rollout of a high,93
NA,speed broadband network? Does the Prime,93
NA,Minister believe that it is acceptable for chil-,93
NA,"dren in countries like Singapore, Japan and",93
NA,Korea to have access to high-speed broad-,93
NA,"band infrastructure for their education, when",93
NA,Australian children do not?,93
Mr HOWARD,I believe that high-speed,93
NA,broadband is important to the education fu-,93
NA,ture of this country. I just do not believe that,93
NA,the Australian taxpayer should pay for some-,93
NA,thing through raiding the Future Fund and,93
NA,plundering $2 billion from the budget which,93
NA,is available for enhancement of communica-,93
NA,tions services in the Australian bush. I do not,93
NA,believe that that $4.7 billion should be,93
NA,taken-$2.7 billion from the Future Fund,93
NA,and $2 billion from rural people-to subsi-,93
NA,"dise commercial operations which ought, as",93
NA,"an operation of market forces, provide the",93
NA,re- broadband that the Australian community,93
NA,needs. This is the Australian Labor Party,93
NA,equivalent of the great debates the British,93
NA,Labour Party used to have about clause 4 of,93
NA,the Constitution and whether you would re-,94
NA,nationalise a whole lot of industries.,94
NA,"While I am on my feet, can I say that the",94
NA,member for Lilley asked me to validate the,94
NA,argument I made that this was an education,94
NA,budget. His leader had asked me some ques-,94
NA,"tions and invited me, and I have now had an",94
NA,opportunity to look at the paper from which,94
NA,he quoted. It is a very revealing examination.,94
NA,"Let me read from under the title ‘Education',",94
NA,6.10 of Budget Paper No. 1. Bear in mind,94
NA,that the Leader of the Opposition asked me,94
NA,two questions that were calculated to demon-,94
NA,"strate that expenditure on education, so far",94
NA,"from rising, had actually fallen.",94
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,94
Mr HOWARD,I see. To start with it,94
NA,"was 7.5 and 7.4, but that 7.5 and 7.4 was not",94
NA,a percentage of GDP. It was not an attempt to,94
NA,compare education spending from one year,94
NA,"to the next; rather, they were percentages of",94
NA,aggregate government spending and made no,94
NA,allowance for the fact that expenditure in,94
NA,other areas may have increased at an even,94
NA,faster rate than education-such as expendi-,94
NA,ture on defence and expenditure on family,94
NA,benefits.,94
NA,I would like the member for Lilley to,94
NA,leave question time with a feeling of tran-,94
NA,quillity and peace about the subject of educa-,94
NA,tion. I will quote from Budget Paper No. 1. It,94
NA,"reads as follows, and I invite the member for",94
NA,Lilley and the member for Griffith to listen,94
NA,to this:,94
NA,Total expenses under the education function are,94
NA,estimated to increase by 9.0 per cent in real,94
NA,"from 2007-08 to 2010-11, or 3.4 per cent annually",94
NA,on average. The major drivers of this growth are,94
NA,the significant new measures for schools and uni-,94
NA,versities announced in the 2007-08 Budget ...,94
NA,This is specifically on the point that I know,94
NA,worries the member for Lilley; I know he,94
NA,worries about this. It goes on to say:,94
NA,Higher education funding is estimated to rise by,94
NA,about 9.7 per cent in real terms from 2007-08 to,94
NA,2010-11 or 3.7 per cent annually on average.,94
NA,All I can conclude is that the Leader of the,94
NA,Opposition is being trickier than usual with,94
NA,his figures. The truth is that we have had an,94
NA,education revolution. The truth is that on the,94
NA,centrepiece-,94
NA,"Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",94
NA,"point of order. As you know, this question",94
NA,was about broadband. We know that the,94
NA,Prime Minister knows nothing about it and,94
NA,its relation to education-,94
The SPEAKER,The Manager of Oppo-,94
NA,sition Business will resume his seat. He will,94
NA,recall that the question started off referring to,94
NA,education and then went to broadband. The,94
NA,Prime Minister is in order.,94
Mr HOWARD,I am broadbanding my,94
NA,answer. I will repeat it because I think the,94
NA,member for Grayndler may have missed it.,94
NA,This really is the thing that I know bugs the,94
NA,opposition. They have been talking about,94
NA,education for the last four or five months.,94
NA,Everywhere they go: ‘Education revolution!',94
NA,Everywhere they go: ‘The way forward is,94
NA,"education.' That is absolutely right, and the",94
NA,way you go forward in education is in part to,94
NA,"spend more money on it, which we are do-",94
NA,"ing. It is also to raise standards, which we are",94
NA,doing. It is also to acknowledge the profes-,94
NA,"sionalism of teachers in Australia, which we",94
NA,do. It is also to recognise the passion of par-,94
NA,ents to make certain that our schools actually,94
NA,teach children how to read and write and add,94
NA,terms up. That is what the Australian public wants,94
NA,and that is what this education revolution,94
NA,will deliver.,94
NA,Budget 2007-08,94
NA,Miss JACKIE KELLY (2.46 pm)-My,94
NA,question is addressed to the Minister for De-,94
NA,fence. Would the minister outline to the,94
NA,House the impact of the budget on defence,94
NA,capability and the recruitment and retention,95
NA,of defence personnel?,95
Dr NELSON,I thank the member for,95
NA,Lindsay for her service to our country in the,95
NA,Royal Australian Air Force and for now do-,95
NA,ing a magnificent job looking after the main-,95
NA,"stream Australians in Western Sydney, in the",95
NA,electorate of Lindsay. The Treasurer last,95
NA,"night, in ‘Locking in the gains, investing in",95
NA,"Australia's future', announced the largest",95
NA,increase in defence investment over the past,95
NA,30 years for a single budget. Last night it,95
NA,was announced by the Treasurer that defence,95
NA,expenditure will increase by 10.6 per cent,95
NA,"over the next year, which will take it to $22",95
NA,"billion. Over the last 11 years, since this",95
NA,"government came to office, defence expendi-",95
NA,ture has increased in real terms by 47 per,95
NA,"cent. In fact, when this government came to",95
NA,"office in 1996, the deficit inherited from",95
NA,Labor Party was almost as large as the de-,95
NA,fence budget in that year alone.,95
NA,Last night an additional $14 billion was,95
NA,committed by this government to defence,95
NA,"over the next 10 years, investing not only in",95
NA,"equipment but also in people, who are indeed",95
NA,our most important asset. The $2 billion an-,95
NA,nounced for recruiting and retention in-,95
NA,"cludes, for example, a significant increase",95
NA,the home loan subsidy for Defence person-,95
NA,"nel, both regulars and reservists. Whereas",95
NA,home loan subsidy was $136 a month for,95
NA,"eligible diggers, it is now going to as much",95
NA,"as $470 a month tax free. In addition to that,",95
NA,"18,000 nonofficers, the lower ranks in our",95
NA,"military, will receive pay increases of up to",95
NA,"some $5,000.",95
NA,We are also announcing that we will be,95
NA,going into partnership with schools and the,95
NA,private sector to drive apprenticeships and,95
NA,training in the Australian Defence Force.,95
NA,There will also be a significant increase in,95
NA,advertising to make sure that we not only,95
NA,focus on having a very visible presence for,95
NA,our three service uniforms in the Australian,95
NA,community but also get back to promoting,95
NA,service in the Australian Defence Force on,95
NA,the basis of the values represented by the,95
NA,three uniforms. There is also an additional,95
NA,"$100 million for cadets, and I encourage all",95
NA,parents-and my own son was in the Army,95
NA,Cadets-to do what they can where possible,95
NA,"to get their kids into cadets. Another 1,000",95
NA,cadets will join as a consequence of this,95
NA,budget.,95
NA,"In addition to that, the Treasurer an-",95
NA,nounced $6 billion over the next 10 years for,95
NA,"the acquisition of 24 FA18F Super Hornets,",95
NA,which will enable us to retire the F111 and,95
NA,safely transition to the Joint Strike Fighter in,95
NA,"the next decade, and another $4 billion for",95
NA,spares and repairs-logistics so important to,95
NA,ensure that we do not get back to Labor's,95
NA,"the defence force, where we ended up having to",95
NA,cannibalise FA18s on the ground to keep,95
NA,ones in the air flying. It is very important to,95
NA,this government that we never return to the,95
NA,days of the Australian Labor Party. It is very,95
NA,important that Australia has a cutting-edge,95
NA,"high-end warfare fighting capability, whether",95
NA,"it is antisurface ship or air combat, at the",95
NA,same time as preparing the Defence Force,95
NA,"to for the next decade in security stabilisation,",95
NA,"maritime border protection, counterterrorism",95
NA,"the and security, and humanitarian relief in our",95
NA,region. This budget delivers on the economic,95
NA,dividend of the last 11 years and makes Aus-,95
NA,"tralia, its interests, its people and its values",95
NA,"more secure on our borders, in our region",95
NA,and throughout the world.,95
NA,Budget 2007-08,95
Mr RUDD ,2.50 pm)-My question is,95
NA,again to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime,95
NA,"Minister now confirm, firstly, that in 2005-",95
NA,06 education outlays as a percentage of total,95
NA,government outlays stand at 7.7 per cent of,95
NA,"budget, according to the government's own",95
NA,"papers; secondly, that in 2010-11 education",95
NA,outlays as a percentage of total government,96
NA,outlays in fact stand at 7.4 per cent of budget,96
NA,according to the government's own papers;,96
NA,"and, finally, that 7.4 per cent is less than 7.7",96
NA,"per cent? Prime Minister, haven't you simply",96
NA,got your answer to this question fundamen-,96
NA,tally and totally wrong?,96
Mr HOWARD,"No, because the answer",96
NA,to that question is that I confirm all of the,96
NA,"figures in the budget paper, and those figures",96
NA,reveal that expenditure on education is going,96
NA,to increase in real terms very significantly,96
NA,over the next three or four years as a result,96
NA,the measures announced last night.,96
NA,What I think the Leader of the Opposition,96
NA,"is getting at is the proposition that, although",96
NA,there has been an increase in expenditure on,96
NA,"education, in other areas of government ex-",96
NA,penditure there may have been an even big-,96
NA,ger increase than has occurred in the area of,96
NA,"education and, therefore, the percentages of",96
NA,total expenditure from one year might be,96
NA,"lower than in a later year, or the other way",96
NA,"around. That does not prove, as the Leader of",96
NA,"the Opposition is trying to allege, that we",96
NA,have cut government spending. The whole,96
NA,point of this tawdry exercise-and it is a,96
NA,tawdry exercise-by the Leader of the Op-,96
NA,position is to try to establish that we have,96
NA,reduced spending on education. We have in,96
NA,"fact done the complete reverse, and educa-",96
NA,tion spending is going to rise over the next,96
NA,four years by more than 3.5 per cent a year in,96
NA,real terms as a result of the measures an-,96
NA,nounced by the Treasurer last night.,96
NA,"I say to the Leader of the Opposition: yes,",96
NA,"I confirm these figures; yes, I confirm that",96
NA,"from one year to the next, because there will",96
NA,be differential rates of increase in expendi-,96
NA,"ture, there may be a situation where a given",96
NA,area as a percentage of total outlays will fall,96
NA,from one year to the next without the real,96
NA,level of that expenditure falling at all. There,96
NA,"is nothing remarkable about that, and the",96
NA,Leader of the Opposition is just trying to be,96
NA,too clever by half.,96

Mr HARDGRAVE ,2.53 pm)- Mr,96
NA,"Speaker, my question is addressed to the",96
NA,"Minister for Families, Community Services",96
NA,and Indigenous Affairs. Would the minister,96
NA,inform the House how last night's budget,96
NA,"will impact on Australian families, from",96
NA,"Calamvale to Chelmer and in Annerley,",96
NA,"Moorooka, Salisbury, Sunnybank and other",96
NA,"places like those, around Australia? What has",96
NA,of been the response to these announcements?,96
Mr BROUGH,I thank the member for,96
NA,Moreton for his question. This budget un-,96
NA,ashamedly puts families at the centre of the,96
NA,priorities of the Howard government. This is,96
NA,an additional $4.5 billion commitment to,96
NA,Australian families over the next five years.,96
NA,"Of course, there are tax cuts for all Austra-",96
NA,lians who are in the workforce. Those who,96
NA,are retired are getting their superannuation,96
NA,"tax free but high-income, self-funded retirees",96
NA,"will get a tax cut. Beyond that, we have",96
NA,"taken into account childcare costs, and we",96
NA,have dramatically reduced that burden on,96
NA,Australian families.,96
NA,"For the member for Moreton, about 6,600",96
NA,families in the Moreton electorate will bene-,96
NA,fit. For an average family on a low income,96
NA,"with one child in care, that means about",96
NA,$20.50 less in the cost of child care as a re-,96
NA,sult of the increase of 13 per cent in child-,96
NA,"care benefit. The member for Moreton, along",96
NA,"with all other honourable members, might",96
NA,like to tell families that are in child care that,96
NA,this year they will be able to claim two lots,96
NA,of childcare tax rebate. That means they will,96
NA,"be able to claim up to $4,000 of their out-of-",96
NA,pocket expenses between now and the end of,96
NA,the year. That is as a result of the Howard,96
NA,government listening to families who said,96
NA,"they really appreciated childcare tax rebate,",96
NA,but they would like it to be a bit more,96
NA,timely-and the Howard government has,97
NA,delivered.,97
NA,We have not forgotten those families who,97
NA,have disabled children. We have increased,97
NA,our spending by an additional $62 million to,97
NA,"assist some 3,000 families to have their",97
NA,"abled children, those kids with slightly",97
NA,"higher needs, supported in child care. I think",97
NA,that is a really important measure.,97
NA,"For those in the bush, sometimes child",97
NA,care becomes quite marginal as far as viabil-,97
NA,ity is concerned. Regional and rural members,97
NA,on both sides of this House can go back and,97
NA,say that the Howard government is commit-,97
NA,ting an additional $43 million for those fami-,97
NA,lies so they can access a quality childcare,97
NA,place.,97
NA,We do not always get positive comments,97
NA,"from ACOSS, but on this particular occasion",97
NA,Lin Hatfield Dodds said she welcomes the,97
NA,government's initiatives on child care and,97
NA,education-the minister for education will be,97
NA,happy to hear that-which are targeted at,97
NA,low-income Australians; not those ‘ Mr Rudd,97
NA,battlers' on one-quarter of a million dollars,97
NA,"but the real battlers. ACOSS said that, rather",97
NA,"than cutting taxes, they were looking for the",97
NA,government to invest in these sorts of,97
NA,things-and that is why Lin Hatfield Dodds,97
NA,is right; we have actually cut taxes for those,97
NA,people and we have improved their access to,97
NA,child care.,97
NA,There are other important families that,97
NA,Howard government has paid attention to:,97
NA,"for example, older families. In the electorate",97
NA,"of Moreton, some 11½ thousand older fami-",97
NA,lies will receive the one-off $500 bonus be-,97
NA,fore 30 June this year to help them with their degree?,97
NA,out-of-pocket expenses.,97
NA,Dr Nelson interjecting-,97
Mr BROUGH,"Real money, as the Min-",97
NA,ister for Defence said.,97
NA,Mr Swan-Does it exist?,97
Mr BROUGH,It exists. I know the,97
NA,member for Lilley thought that the family tax,97
NA,supplement was not real. I can tell him that,97
NA,that was real. This is real. It will be appreci-,97
NA,"ated by those families out there, who say that",97
NA,dis- the Howard government is listening and,97
NA,helping them share in the wealth of this na-,97
NA,"tion that they contributed to. In the past, the",97
NA,Howard government has given larger fami-,97
NA,lies-those who have been blessed with trip-,97
NA,"lets or quadruplets-a bonus, whereby they",97
NA,"got $3,000 for a family with triplets and just",97
NA,"over $4,000 for a family with quadruplets.",97
NA,That used to cut out at when the children,97
NA,were six years of age but now it will go right,97
NA,through to 16 years of age or when the chil-,97
NA,"dren turn 18, in their last year of education.",97
NA,"It does not matter how old you are, it does",97
NA,"not matter how many children you have, and",97
NA,it does not matter if you are struggling with,97
NA,"the complexities of being a carer, the How-",97
NA,ard government has listened to Australian,97
NA,families. We have shared the prosperity of,97
NA,"this nation, and we have allowed everyone to",97
NA,benefit from the strength of the Australian,97
NA,economy.,97
NA,Budget 2007-08,97
Mr STEPHEN SMITH ,2.58 pm)- Mr,97
NA,"Speaker, my question is to the Minister for",97
NA,"Education, Science and Training. Isn't it the",97
NA,case that last night's budget increased the,97
NA,"student HECS contribution, effective from",97
NA,"the January 2008, by more than $1,200 per year",97
NA,"for new students studying accounting, eco-",97
NA,nomics or commerce? Doesn't this increase,97
NA,the student HECS contribution by nearly,97
NA,$200 million over the life of a three-year,97
Ms JULIE BISHOP,I can confirm that,97
NA,under a Howard government no accounting,97
NA,student will be paying $200 million for an,97
NA,accounting degree!,97
NA,"Government members-Ha, ha!",97
The SPEAKER,Members on my right!,98
NA,Order!,98
Ms JULIE BISHOP,Last night in the,98
NA,budget the Treasurer announced in the $1.7,98
NA,billion higher education package that some,98
NA,$560 million in extra funding would be de-,98
NA,livered to universities for courses such as,98
NA,science and maths and engineering and allied,98
NA,health and medicine and dentistry. In maths,98
NA,and science there will be an increase of some,98
NA,"$2,729 per place; in allied health, some",98
NA,"$1,889; and in engineering, science and sur-",98
NA,"veying and clinical psychology, $2,729. So",98
NA,"all told, that is $560 million in increased",98
NA,funding for specific courses that are part of,98
NA,our national priorities. In the case of ac-,98
NA,"counting and commerce, we have put that",98
NA,into the same category as law because that,98
NA,"reflects the cost of delivery of that course,",98
NA,reflects the demand and it reflects the gross,98
NA,lifetime earnings of accounting graduates.,98
NA,Universities can decide for themselves,98
NA,whether or not there should be any change to,98
NA,the HECS.,98
NA,Vocational and Further Education,98
Mr LAMING ,3.00 pm)-My question is,98
NA,to the Minister for Vocational and Further,98
NA,Education. Would the minister inform the,98
NA,House how the government has continued to,98
NA,invest substantially in vocational and further,98
NA,"education? Minister, are there any alternative",98
NA,policies and what is the government's re-,98
NA,sponse?,98
Mr ROBB,I thank the member for,98
NA,Bowman for his question and for his very,98
NA,genuine interest in this area. I might begin,98
NA,"with the alternative policies, because there I",98
NA,can be brief. In Labor's much touted Educa-,98
NA,"tion Revolution document, on skills needs,",98
NA,"the so-called skills crisis, and vocational and",98
NA,technical education the sum total of discus-,98
NA,sion was four lonely paragraphs-and not,98
NA,one idea amongst them. Yet the member for,98
NA,Lilley last night was out asserting that Labor,98
NA,had set the agenda on vocational and techni-,98
NA,"cal education. Fortunately, we have not",98
NA,"waited for Labor to tell us what to do, and I",98
NA,can report for the benefit of the member for,98
NA,"Lilley that in 1996 there were 1,500 people",98
NA,doing apprenticeships in his electorate. He,98
NA,can now go back and report to his electorate,98
NA,"that today there are 4,280 people doing ap-",98
NA,prenticeships-nearly a threefold increase in,98
NA,the last 11 years. So we have done a lot. We,98
NA,have now spent around $3 billion a year,98
NA,compared with $1 billion 10 years ago when,98
NA,we took over office. That is a 99 per cent real,98
NA,increase in spending on vocational and tech-,98
NA,nical education in the last 11 years.,98
NA,Yet we have a rapidly ageing population,98
NA,and the experience of well over a decade of,98
NA,uninterrupted economic growth. This means,98
NA,it that we have further challenges. That is why,98
NA,last night we made a further substantial in-,98
NA,vestment of $668 million in vocational and,98
NA,further education. That adds to the $837 mil-,98
NA,"lion that we announced last November, just",98
NA,"six months ago, for the Skills for the Future",98
NA,"package. So, in total, in the last six months",98
NA,the government has announced $1.5 billion,98
NA,for technical and further education.,98
NA,Last night's announced initiatives were,98
NA,"aimed at three things: improving the status,",98
NA,"improving the opportunity, and raising the",98
NA,level of vocational and technical education,98
NA,across our workforce. Specifically the meas-,98
NA,"ures included, in the trades areas facing a",98
NA,"skills shortage, a tax-free $1,000 wage top-",98
NA,up to every firstand second-year apprentice,98
NA,"under 30 years of age. On top of that, every",98
NA,"firstand second-year apprentice, without",98
NA,"age restriction, will get a fee voucher worth",98
NA,up to $500 a go towards their TAFE or other,98
NA,training fees. When you put that together,98
NA,"with a trade scholarship, each firstand sec-",98
NA,ond-year apprentice across the country in,98
NA,areas of trade skill shortage will get a total of,98
NA,"$1,500 a year as a tax-free top-up for their",98
NA,wages and a $500 contribution towards their,98
NA,"TAFE fees-nearly $2,000, or up to $2,000,",99
NA,for every firstand second-year apprentice.,99
NA,The government also announced the es-,99
NA,tablishment of three more Australian techni-,99
NA,"cal colleges, one in southern Brisbane, one",99
NA,Western Sydney and one in northern Perth.,99
NA,This means that in the five largest cities we,99
NA,will have two technical colleges across the,99
NA,country to combine with the other 18 techni-,99
NA,cal colleges in regional and other cities in,99
NA,"Australia. Furthermore, we announced nearly",99
NA,$60 million to develop fast track apprentice-,99
NA,ships. We have extended fee help to full fee,99
NA,paying students pursuing diploma and ad-,99
NA,vanced diploma courses through the VET,99
NA,system and we have provided further assis-,99
NA,tance for our Indigenous community and for,99
NA,people with disabilities to enter the work-,99
NA,"force. So, along with the tax cuts and the",99
NA,childcare and the superannuation initiatives,99
NA,"last night, these new measures will further",99
NA,expand our productive capacity at a time,99
NA,when the economy is at full stretch.,99
NA,Higher Education,99
Mr STEPHEN SMITH ,3.06 pm)-My,99
NA,question is again to the Minister for Educa-,99
NA,"tion, Science and Training. Isn't it the case",99
NA,that the annual income stream of $300 mil-,99
NA,lion from the Higher Education Endowment,99
NA,Fund for each of Australia's 38 universities,99
NA,would mean that each university would only,99
NA,"receive, on average, an annual payment of $8",99
NA,million? Given that important teaching and,99
NA,research infrastructure like the medical re-,99
NA,search centre at the ANU in Canberra cost,99
NA,"$125 million, how can the government claim",99
NA,that this will make up for 10 years of neglect,99
NA,of our universities?,99
Ms JULIE BISHOP,I thank the mem-,99
NA,ber for Perth for his question. He obviously,99
NA,does not understand that the endowment,99
NA,fund is on top of what the Australian gov-,99
NA,ernment already provides universities for,99
NA,capital works and research facilities. Last,99
NA,year alone the Australian government pro-,99
NA,vided over $240 million for capital and $460,99
NA,million for research facilities. What the,99
NA,Treasurer announced last night is an endow-,99
NA,"in ment fund that will be invested, with the in-",99
NA,come from that endowment fund being dis-,99
NA,tributed to universities on top of what we,99
NA,already fund. This is an unprecedented level,99
NA,of investment in Australian universities. The,99
NA,Australian Labor Party could only dream of,99
NA,such an initiative.,99
NA,Climate Change,99
Mrs VALE ,3.07 pm)-My question is,99
NA,addressed to the Minister for the Environ-,99
NA,ment and Water Resources. Would the minis-,99
NA,ter inform the House of the recent budget,99
NA,announcements to boost initiatives on cli-,99
NA,mate change and the environment? Are there,99
NA,any alternative approaches?,99
Mr TURNBULL,I thank the member,99
NA,for Hughes for her question and acknowl-,99
NA,edge her very keen interest in environmental,99
NA,and water matters. Last night's budget con-,99
NA,tinues the Howard government's record lev-,99
NA,els of environment spending. Over the last 11,99
NA,years the government has invested almost,99
NA,$20 billion to protect the environment and in,99
NA,the next year we have committed $4.3 billion,99
NA,in funding to tackle the pressing issues of,99
NA,"climate change, water scarcity and natural",99
NA,resource management. At the centre of the,99
NA,budget-the environmental part of the,99
NA,budget-is the $10 billion National Plan for,99
NA,Water Security.,99
NA,Water scarcity is a global problem. There,99
NA,are many countries facing water scarcity,99
NA,problems as severe as Australia's. There is no,99
NA,country in the world which has a comprehen-,99
NA,sive national plan to tackle water scarcity,99
NA,like Australia does. It is thanks to the leader-,99
NA,"ship of the Prime Minister, the leadership of",99
NA,"this government, that we have that $10 bil-",99
NA,"lion plan, that we have a coordinated effort",99
NA,that is capable of restoring efficiency to our,99
NA,"irrigation systems, restoring environmental",100
NA,flows. That $10 billion plan has been wel-,100
NA,comed around Australia and admired around,100
NA,"the world, but it is still not enjoying the sup-",100
NA,port of the Labor government in Victoria.,100
NA,"At the grassroots level, saving water and",100
NA,"setting an example of using water efficiently,",100
NA,is vital. We have committed-,100
NA,Ms Gillard interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER,The Deputy Leader of,100
NA,the Opposition is warned!,100
Mr TURNBULL,$200 million towards,100
NA,community water grants. These provide the,100
NA,opportunity to save a considerable amount of,100
NA,"water, but far more importantly than that-",100
NA,Ms Gillard interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER,The deputy leader has,100
NA,been warned.,100
Mr TURNBULL,they provide the op-,100
NA,portunity for schoolchildren and communi-,100
NA,ties to understand how water can be saved,100
NA,"and preserved. On climate change, the Aus-",100
NA,"tralian government, once again, is showing",100
NA,global leadership. In the budget we provide,100
NA,for our global initiative on forests and cli-,100
NA,mate. This is the first substantial national,100
NA,commitment to attack the global problem of,100
NA,deforestation. The opposition like to talk,100
NA,about global warming but they will not rec-,100
NA,ognise that it is a global problem. A tonne of,100
NA,CO2 that goes into the atmosphere in China,100
NA,does as much damage as a tonne of CO2 that,100
NA,goes into the atmosphere here. We are tack-,100
NA,ling that globally with our global initiative,100
NA,on forests and climate.,100
NA,"At home, we are genuinely doubling the",100
NA,solar panel rebate. We all remember that the,100
NA,member for Kingsford Smith said he was,100
NA,"doubling the rebate, but he did not know that",100
NA,double meant twice as much. That is sort of,100
NA,important. Two times four equals eight. We,100
NA,have doubled the rebate from $4 a watt and a,100
NA,"maximum of $4,000 to $8 a watt and a",100
NA,"maximum of $8,000.",100
NA,Ms Gillard interjecting-,100
The SPEAKER,Order! The minister,100
NA,will resume his seat. I have continually,100
NA,drawn to the attention of the Deputy Leader,100
NA,of the Opposition that she should not be in-,100
NA,terjecting. She has been warned. She ignores,100
NA,that warning. She will remove herself from,100
NA,the chamber under standing order 94(a).,100
NA,The member for Lalor then left the cham-,100
NA,ber.,100
Mr TURNBULL,The member for,100
NA,Hughes asked me to consider alternative,100
NA,policies. There are no alternative policies on,100
NA,water from the opposition. The $10 billion,100
NA,national plan had no counterpart in the Labor,100
NA,Party's repertoire. When it was announced,100
NA,the member for Kingsford Smith said-and I,100
NA,"was sitting right here, listening to him in-",100
NA,tently-‘It's Labor Party policy.' I could not,100
NA,"find it, and neither could he. He had as much",100
NA,difficulty proving that misstatement as he did,100
NA,with the solar panel rebate. The opposition's,100
NA,policy on climate change is a unilateral 60,100
NA,per cent reduction in emissions in Australia,100
NA,by 2050. It proposes to do that regardless of,100
NA,what the rest of the world does. If the mem-,100
NA,ber for Kingsford Smith had read the IPCC,100
NA,"report published recently, he would be aware",100
NA,of the lengthy discussion on the problems of,100
NA,one country imposing restrictions and the,100
NA,carbon emissions just leaking over to other,100
NA,countries. There would be no gain to the,100
NA,world. There would be massive economic,100
NA,loss in that country.,100
NA,Global warming needs a global solution.,100
NA,We are committed to a global solution and,100
NA,we are working towards it. We are not going,100
NA,to devastate the Australian economy in a fu-,100
NA,"tile, ideological gesture that is more about",100
NA,gratifying the prejudices of the member for,100
NA,Kingsford Smith and his colleagues than,100
NA,achieving the outcomes the world needs.,100

The SPEAKER,I have received a letter,101
NA,from the honorable member for Lilley pro-,101
NA,posing that a definite matter of public impor-,101
NA,tance be submitted to the House for discus-,101
NA,"sion, namely:",101
NA,The inadequacy of the 2007 Budget to secure,101
NA,future economic prosperity by addressing the,101
NA,nation's long term challenges of flagging produc-,101
NA,tivity growth and dangerous climate change.,101
NA,I call upon those members who approve of,102
NA,the proposed discussion to rise in their,102
NA,places.,102
NA,More than the number of members re-,102
NA,quired by the standing orders having risen in,102
NA,their places-,102
Mr SWAN ,Lilley) (3.16 pm)-It is my,102
NA,privilege to support this matter of public im-,102
NA,portance on the failure of the 2007 budget to,102
NA,secure future economic prosperity by ad-,102
NA,dressing the nation's long-term challenges of,102
NA,flagging productivity growth and climate,102
NA,change. I want to start by thanking the,102
NA,Treasurer for doing something that Labor has,102
NA,been doing for a very long period. For a long,102
NA,"time, Labor has been talking about education",102
NA,"and climate change, two issues which go to",102
NA,the very heart of our economic prosperity,102
NA,"and our survival as a nation, two issues",102
NA,which are absolutely central to the future of,102
NA,the nation.,102
NA,Education is central to boosting productiv-,102
NA,"ity in Australia, and lifting productivity is",102
NA,way we can guarantee rising living standards,102
NA,beyond the mining boom. The recent Inter-,102
NA,generational report delivered that message,102
NA,as well-that lifting productivity is the key,102
NA,to future wealth creation beyond the mining,102
NA,boom. We all know that two key elements of,102
NA,lifting productivity are education and modern,102
NA,infrastructure. They are absolutely central.,102
NA,"They are just as central as climate change,",102
NA,which has to be addressed in an absolutely,102
NA,comprehensive way. If we do not address,102
NA,"climate change, future prosperity will be",102
NA,"threatened. So thank you, Treasurer, for in-",102
NA,serting two words which were not in last,102
NA,year's budget speech-productivity and cli-,102
NA,mate change. Those two words were missing,102
NA,completely-,102

NA,"has disinvested in education over 11 years,",102
NA,and that proves that productivity has not,102
NA,been central to the government's agenda dur-,102
NA,ing those 11 long years. Labor says it is time,102
NA,our nation started using the budget to invest,102
NA,"in the future of the nation, rather than simply",102
NA,using it to buy the government's way back,102
NA,into power. So why are education and cli-,102
NA,mate change now the centrepiece of this,102
NA,"year's budget? It is pretty clear: it is politics,",102
NA,"clear and simple. We have a stale, reactive,",102
NA,slow-on-the-uptake government which has,102
NA,decided to give itself an extreme makeover.,102
NA,Watching the Treasurer trying to give himself,102
NA,an extreme makeover is extremely humor-,102
NA,ous. It is not very comfortable. The Treasurer,102
NA,is not comfortable talking about climate,102
NA,change and he most certainly is not comfort-,102
NA,the able talking about education. He is trying to,102
NA,camouflage the government's complacency,102
NA,"on these key issues, which is driving a strong",102
NA,mood for change in the community. The,102
NA,community sees this government as being,102
NA,"stuck in the past, complacently relying on the",102
NA,commodity boom rather than putting in place,102
NA,a reform program to lift productivity and to,102
NA,create wealth beyond the mining boom. That,102
NA,is why we say this budget is a re-election,102
NA,budget.,102
NA,Most certainly it is not a reform budget. It,102
NA,does not take a rocket scientist to see what,102
NA,has been happening here. Kevin Rudd has,102
NA,"offered a vision for the future, a package of",102
NA,reforms that will prepare our economy for,102
NA,the future challenges we will face. This vi-,102
NA,sion is striking a chord with the Australian,102
NA,community after 11 years of a government,102
NA,that is simply stuck in the past.,102
NA,Mr Costello thinks he is a very clever boy.,102
NA,He knows that Labor's vision for the future,102
NA,is striking a chord so he is scrambling to re-,103
NA,invent himself before this year's election. All,103
NA,"of a sudden, the language Labor have been",103
NA,using constantly appears in the Treasurer's,103
NA,words. His budget is about securing the fu-,103
NA,ture. Who has been talking about that? His,103
NA,budget contains huge reforms. Who has been,103
NA,talking about this? When Labor announced,103
NA,"our education revolution, it struck a chord,",103
NA,and next thing we have the Prime Minister,103
NA,calling for an education revolution. Why?,103
NA,Because this government has been threatened,103
NA,electorally. It has not moved because there is,103
NA,a fundamental problem in our economy; it,103
NA,has moved because the election is around the,103
NA,corner and there is a very strong mood for,103
NA,change in the Australian community.,103
NA,We need reform. Despite rivers of gold,103
NA,flowing from the mining boom in recent,103
NA,"years, this government has not been invest-",103
NA,ing in the nation's capacity. Economic re-,103
NA,form and productivity growth have faltered,103
NA,on this Treasurer's watch. Productivity,103
NA,growth has fallen from 3.2 per cent to 2.2 per,103
NA,cent in the latest productivity cycle. It has,103
NA,fallen even lower since then.,103
NA,This slowdown has seen us slip further,103
NA,behind the productivity leaders in an increas-,103
NA,ingly competitive global environment. In,103
NA,"comparative terms, we have now almost",103
NA,completely lost the productivity gains asso-,103
NA,ciated with the economic reforms imple-,103
NA,"mented over the 1980s and 1990s. Of course,",103
NA,"as we demonstrated in question time, the",103
NA,budget papers reveal that our flagging pro-,103
NA,ductivity growth is not expected to improve,103
NA,"anytime soon. In fact, the forecasts on page",103
NA,1-5 of Budget Paper No. 1 reveal zero pro-,103
NA,ductivity growth in 2006-07 and declining,103
NA,productivity growth at the end of the next,103
NA,financial year.,103
NA,"If this is a budget that is about the future,",103
NA,that is designed to lift the productive capac-,103
NA,"ity of the economy, why does the budget",103
NA,forecast declining productivity growth? Why,103
NA,"does it forecast that? In fact, in the Intergen-",103
NA,"erational report released last month, the",103
NA,government revised down its projection of,103
NA,productivity growth over this decade from,103
NA,1.7 per cent to just 1.5 per cent. This is less,103
NA,than half the rate of productivity growth,103
NA,achieved over the 1990s. So this government,103
NA,has a poor record.,103
NA,We as a nation need to urgently turn,103
NA,around our flagging productivity growth if,103
NA,we are to build prosperity for the future and,103
NA,"to build it beyond the mining boom, which is",103
NA,why this country urgently needs an education,103
NA,revolution. We welcome the education initia-,103
NA,tives in this budget; they are a useful contri-,103
NA,bution after 11 years of disinvestment. But,103
NA,with the best global conditions in over 30,103
NA,"years, and the windfall from the mining",103
NA,"boom, the government should have already",103
NA,built a world-class education system. How-,103
NA,"ever, they have not been doing that.",103
NA,These budget papers show that expendi-,103
NA,ture as a percentage of GDP has fallen.,103
NA,"Treasurer, no matter how much you try to",103
NA,drag a dead cat across the figures you pre-,103
NA,"sented in question time, it has fallen. It has",103
NA,fallen over 11 years. Even with the new,103
NA,"spending in this budget, education spending",103
NA,will fall as a proportion of the total budget,103
NA,over the forward estimates. That was demon-,103
NA,strated comprehensively during question,103
NA,time in the questioning of the Prime Minister,103
NA,by the Leader of the Opposition. We are slip-,103
NA,"ping behind our competitors. Overall, Aus-",103
NA,tralia's investment in education as a propor-,103
NA,tion of GDP ranks behind 17 other OECD,103
NA,"economies, including Poland, Hungary and",103
NA,New Zealand.,103
NA,So whilst these budget measures are wel-,103
NA,"come, while they are useful, they are a long",103
NA,way from the education revolution needed to,103
NA,secure our future. Just consider this compari-,103
NA,son: this budget commits $3.5 billion to its,103
NA,education and skills package over four years.,104
NA,That is roughly the same amount committed,104
NA,in one-off pre-election payments to go out in,104
NA,the next eight weeks.,104
NA,Mr Costello-Are you against them?,104
Mr SWAN,"We are absolutely for them,",104
NA,"Treasurer. Most notably, the budget fails to",104
NA,invest in high-quality universal preschool,104
NA,"education for all four-year-olds, to give them",104
NA,"the best start possible. As we know, Labor is",104
NA,committed to a $450 million package to pro-,104
NA,vide play based learning for all four-year-,104
NA,olds. Labor has also committed up to $200,104
NA,million for 260 new childcare centres on,104
NA,school sites.,104
NA,"We welcome the measures on apprentices,",104
NA,but there is nothing in this package which,104
NA,shows that the government comprehends the,104
NA,magnitude of the challenge before us and the,104
NA,nature of the education revolution we require,104
NA,if we are to deal with declining productivity.,104
NA,The government has established its Higher,104
NA,Education Endowment Fund. That is a wel-,104
NA,come initiative because the government has,104
NA,"neglected this area for too long, but its way",104
NA,of paying for it is interesting. Its way of,104
NA,ing for it undermines the government's case,104
NA,against Labor's national plan for high-speed,104
NA,broadband. The government is proposing to,104
NA,pay for this measure by taking part of the,104
NA,surplus that would otherwise have gone to,104
NA,"the Future Fund. And, just as the education",104
NA,"endowment is an investment, so is Labor's",104
NA,high-speed broadband initiative. The Treas-,104
NA,urer simply can't have it both ways.,104
NA,That brings us to broadband. We saw in,104
NA,the parliament during question time that the,104
NA,Prime Minister simply does not get broad-,104
NA,band. He does not comprehend how impor-,104
NA,tant broadband is for lifting productivity in,104
NA,this economy and that this country urgently,104
NA,needs a solution so that we can get high-,104
NA,speed broadband to all Australians. Its im-,104
NA,portance to business and to families is simply,104
NA,not comprehended by this Prime Minister.,104
NA,"That brings us to tax cuts, because the tax",104
NA,cuts in this budget are welcome. They do,104
NA,start to tackle some of the worst disincen-,104
NA,tives to workforce participation. As the,104
NA,"Treasurer will well recall, it has been Labor",104
NA,in this House that has been making the case,104
NA,constantly for taxation reform to ease the,104
NA,high effective marginal tax rates which have,104
NA,"been hitting second-income earners, who are",104
NA,"predominantly women. All of a sudden, there",104
NA,is another conversion from the Treasurer. He,104
NA,"has discovered part-time workers, he has",104
NA,finally discovered they are women and he,104
NA,"has finally discovered that they, too, deserve",104
NA,"an incentive, like everybody else in the tax",104
NA,"system. Of course, that has taken 11 years.",104
NA,"But we certainly welcome these tax cuts, and",104
NA,we also welcome the fact that they are,104
NA,"staged, because to stage them will minimise",104
NA,the risk of inflationary pressures. But these,104
NA,tax cuts do not even hand back all the addi-,104
NA,tional tax that the government is collecting as,104
NA,a consequence of the mining boom. Despite,104
NA,"the tax cuts, the government will still collect",104
NA,"paymore than $10 billion more in income taxes,",104
NA,"excluding company taxes, from 2007-08 to",104
NA,2009-10 than originally anticipated before,104
NA,the budget.,104
NA,"This is a high-taxing, high-spending gov-",104
NA,ernment. What is important here is a stable,104
NA,macroeconomic environment. Labor is,104
NA,committed to disciplined fiscal policy. We,104
NA,are committed to running budget surpluses,104
NA,"over the medium term, to not increasing tax",104
NA,as a proportion of GDP and to meeting our,104
NA,commitments by reprioritising spending in,104
NA,the budget and cutting out waste.,104
NA,"That brings us to climate change, because",104
NA,there is not a comprehensive program that,104
NA,this country needs being put in place to com-,104
NA,bat climate change. We know that the Treas-,104
NA,urer is a well-known climate change sceptic.,104
NA,We know the record of the Prime Minister;,105
NA,we know the record of the industry minister.,105
NA,We know the view of the Treasury-that the,105
NA,government does not get it when it comes to,105
NA,combating climate change and dealing with,105
NA,problems in water. The government simply,105
NA,"does not get this, and we know that from the",105
NA,speech given by Treasury Secretary Ken,105
NA,Henry over a month ago. He blew the whistle,105
NA,"on the Treasurer, he blew the whistle on the",105
NA,Prime Minister and he blew the whistle on,105
NA,the cabinet about their inattention,105
NA,change and water problems and their central,105
NA,importance to wealth creation in this com-,105
NA,munity. That whistle was well and truly,105
NA,blown by the government's chief economic,105
NA,"adviser, who pinged them for what they",105
NA,are-completely irresponsible when it comes,105
NA,to dealing with one of the most serious issues,105
NA,which goes to the heart of future economic,105
NA,"prosperity, job creation and environmental",105
NA,sustainability.,105
NA,That is why we do not have an emissions,105
NA,trading scheme. That is why we do not have,105
NA,a serious response to renewable energy. That,105
NA,is why we do not have a serious response to,105
NA,demand management. All of these things are,105
NA,"missing, but no doubt they will come-and",105
NA,why? Because Labor under Kevin Rudd and,105
NA,"Peter Garrett, and also the member for",105
NA,"Grayndler, have been putting out compre-",105
NA,hensive plans to combat dangerous climate,105
NA,change. We have left the government for,105
NA,dead and they are so embarrassed that they,105
NA,are going to be forced to follow in the,105
NA,months ahead. It will be really exciting to,105
NA,watch the backflips and the U-turns and so,105
NA,on.,105
NA,That brings us finally to where this econ-,105
NA,omy should be going. The Treasurer would,105
NA,have us all believe that the economic reform,105
NA,process starts and ends with him. The reality,105
NA,is that much of our current wealth owes a lot,105
NA,to the reforms implemented by the Hawke,105
NA,and Keating governments. I would like to,105
NA,quote an eminent authority on this: the Sec-,105
NA,retary of the Treasury-the government's,105
NA,pre-eminent economic adviser. This is what,105
NA,he had to say:,105
NA,That macro performance owes much to decades,105
NA,"of reform that have improved monetary, fiscal and",105
NA,structural policy frameworks.,105
NA,… … …,105
NA,Much of our recent macroeconomic and fiscal,105
NA,"success is based on past reforms, assisted by the",105
NA,terms of trade. A significant proportion of the,105
NA,to climate latter may be transitory.,105
NA,The Secretary of the Treasury is warning all,105
NA,Australians that the government is not pre-,105
NA,pared for the future beyond the mining boom,105
NA,and has not put in place the essential reforms,105
NA,required to lift productivity and create wealth,105
NA,beyond the mining boom. That is the warn-,105
NA,ing from the Secretary of the Treasury; it is a,105
NA,damning indictment of the performance of,105
NA,this Treasurer and the performance of the,105
NA,"Howard government. During this time, a",105
NA,"time of plenty, it has been raining gold bars.",105
NA,There have been substantial increases in na-,105
NA,tional income. Why haven't we taken the,105
NA,"opportunity to create a First-World, first-",105
NA,class education and training system so we,105
NA,can compete in our region and become even,105
NA,more prosperous and wealthy? Why has the,105
NA,government not done that? Because it has,105
NA,"been complacent, tired and stuck in the past.",105
NA,(Time expired),105
Mr COSTELLO ,Higgins-Treasurer),105
NA,(3.31 pm)-Members will recall a former,105
NA,"National Secretary of the ALP, Gary Gray,",105
NA,complaining that Labor was increasingly,105
NA,relying on what he called ‘white-bread poli-,105
NA,ticians' who were coming into parliament-,105
NA,people who had no real experience outside of,105
NA,politics and were bland and insubstantial.,105
NA,"That criticism that Gary Gray made, without",105
NA,"naming whom he had in mind, was made in",105
NA,"relation to Mr Swan, the member for Lilley,",105
NA,"and Mr Smith, the member for Perth-two",105
NA,people who came into this parliament out of,105
NA,the ALP machine and had experience in fo-,106
NA,cus groups and polling but never really had,106
NA,"any great interest in policy or, indeed, what",106
NA,makes economic policy work.,106
NA,If you wanted a demonstration of that,106
NA,criticism that Gary Gray made of the mem-,106
NA,"ber for Lilley, you would have seen it in the",106
NA,speech that he just made-completely insub-,106
NA,"stantial, offering nothing except rhetorical",106
NA,"lines, the kind of rhetorical lines that he",106
NA,would have got a focus group to put together,106
NA,and then retailed around to the Labor Party,106
NA,as lines to use in relation to the budget. The,106
NA,focus group that he obviously got together,106
NA,"was the source of this media release, which",106
NA,just about says it all in terms of the depth,106
NA,thinking of the member for Lilley. I guess,106
NA,just about every word that he used in that,106
NA,speech came from this press release in one,106
NA,form or another. The press release itself came,106
NA,"from the focus group, and it illustrates really",106
NA,how insubstantial Labor has now become in,106
NA,relation to economic policy.,106
NA,Normally in a budget reply a shadow,106
NA,Treasurer would stand up and say: ‘These,106
NA,will be the macro effects of what you did and,106
NA,this is why they are wrong. Maybe the,106
NA,"budget surplus, instead of being one per cent",106
NA,"of GDP, should have been 0.1 per cent of",106
NA,GDP or maybe it should have been two per,106
NA,cent. This is what we think about the eco-,106
NA,nomic forecast. Your economic forecast for,106
NA,growth of 3¾ per cent is wrong because we,106
NA,think household consumption will not be as,106
NA,"strong as you are saying, or we think that net",106
NA,exports will detract from growth to a larger,106
NA,degree. Here's what we think about your in-,106
NA,"flation forecast. We think that, given pressure",106
NA,arising out of the drought or given pressure,106
NA,arising from international oil prices-,106
NA,because we do not agree with those assump-,106
NA,tions-your inflation target will be wrong.,106
NA,Here's what we would have done on tax cuts.,106
NA,We believe that you have cut tax too far,106
NA,down the scale or too far up the scale or you,106
NA,haven't cut it enough. You should have,106
NA,changed the mix to move tax cuts off income,106
NA,tax and maybe put them on business tax.,106
NA,Here's what we think you should have had,106
NA,your investment in. We don't think an en-,106
NA,dowment fund is the right way to go because,106
NA,it is a capital fund. We would have gone with,106
NA,recurrent funding; we would have gone for,106
NA,"the current amount. Mr Speaker, here's what",106
NA,an alternative government would do.',106
NA,But you will never hear that from the,106
NA,member for Lilley. You will never hear it,106
NA,because I do not think he has ever really un-,106
NA,derstood the nature of economic policy in,106
NA,Australia and he certainly has not done the,106
NA,of work. To him it is a question of getting a fo-,106
NA,"cus group, running a line and moving on be-",106
NA,fore anybody actually scratches for things,106
NA,that are substantive underneath. He is some-,106
NA,"body who is quite voluble, but there is never",106
NA,any substance behind it. There was never,106
NA,actually any substance in his reply. In all of,106
NA,the budget replies I have heard from five,106
NA,"shadow treasurers now, that would be the",106
NA,weakest without question. We had Gareth,106
NA,"Evans, Simon Crean, Bob MCMullan and",106
NA,"Mark Latham, but I do not think I have heard",106
NA,a weaker budget reply than the one we have,106
NA,just heard. I think we can deal with it pretty,106
NA,quickly.,106
NA,He welcomed the Higher Education En-,106
NA,"dowment Fund, he welcomed the tax cuts",106
NA,and the fact that they were staged and he,106
NA,welcomed the apprenticeships. He welcomed,106
NA,those measures that are going to be done be-,106
NA,"fore 30 June, so everything that was done",106
NA,was right. I do not think there was anything,106
NA,that the government did that he said was,106
NA,"wrong, but I think the essence of it was that",106
NA,we should have spent more in every area of,106
NA,the budget and ended up with a bigger sur-,106
NA,plus. I think that was the outcome: ‘You,106
NA,"should have cut tax, spent more in every area",106
NA,of the budget and ended up with a bigger,106
NA,surplus.' Why didn't I think of that for a pro-,106
NA,posal? We should have spent more on educa-,107
NA,"tion, we should have spent more on skills,",107
NA,we should have spent more on climate,107
NA,"change, we should have spent more on the",107
NA,"environment, we should have cut tax and we",107
NA,should have had more left over.,107
NA,That is the kind of thing that you would,107
NA,try and get away with at an ALP branch,107
NA,"meeting as a machine man, but every now",107
NA,and then you are confronted with facts. The,107
NA,"fact of the matter is that, when you are man-",107
NA,"aging a $240 billion budget, there are more",107
NA,demands than can possibly be funded. Some-,107
NA,times you have to be able to say no. Manag-,107
NA,ing a federal budget requires a bit of,107
NA,strength; you have to be able to say no and,107
NA,sometimes you have to be able to say no to a,107
NA,minister. Sometimes you have to be able to,107
NA,say no to a whole government. Sometimes,107
NA,you have to make very hard choices if you,107
NA,"want to get a particular outcome, and when",107
NA,you want to get that particular outcome it is,107
NA,not enough to convene a focus group and ask,107
NA,for a slick line or an insubstantial criticism.,107
NA,actually takes hard assessment and hard,107
NA,work.,107
NA,The place where Australia is now did not,107
NA,just drop out of the sky. It was not as if a,107
NA,cloud was suddenly unleashed on Australia,107
NA,"or, as he said, ‘Oh, gold bars just started",107
NA,ing on Australia.' If the member for Lilley,107
NA,"thinks that about economic management, it",107
NA,illustrates how ill equipped he is for the great,107
NA,role of being in government. If he believes-,107
NA,and I do not think he believes it for a mo-,107
NA,"ment-that you balance a budget, reform a",107
NA,"tax system, improve industrial relations, pay",107
NA,off $96 billion worth of debt or set up a Fu-,107
NA,ture Fund and it is all just some kind of fluke,107
NA,then he is less prepared for government than,107
NA,"I suspect many of us, even in our worst",107
NA,"nightmares, thought would have been the",107
NA,case.,107
NA,One of the things that the member for,107
NA,Lilley said in his speech is that of course,107
NA,Labor is committed to budget surpluses.,107
NA,Why would he say that? The focus groups,107
NA,"would have said, ‘You've got to show that",107
NA,you're committed to balanced budgets.' It is,107
NA,"easily said. Anybody can say that, but I",107
NA,would ask him this question: as an adviser to,107
NA,the Labor Party and a Labor Party staffer in,107
NA,all those years when Labor were in govern-,107
NA,ment between 1990 and 1996 when they ran,107
NA,"consecutive budget deficits, if he was so",107
NA,committed to surpluses why weren't there,107
NA,any? I think it is a fair question: why weren't,107
NA,there any?,107
NA,For the sake of the record I think we ought,107
NA,"not to actually listen to the words, we ought",107
NA,"to listen to the deeds, because in 1990-91 the",107
NA,federal government deficit was 2.8 per cent,107
NA,"of GDP. In 1991-92, it was 3.9 per cent; in",107
NA,"1992-93, 3.7 per cent; in 1993-94, 2.7 per",107
NA,"cent; in 1994-95, 1.9 per cent; and in 1995-",107
NA,"96, one per cent. So that is six straight defi-",107
NA,"It cits, the highest of which was four per cent",107
NA,of GDP. If we had had a deficit of four per,107
NA,cent of GDP in the budget I brought down,107
NA,last night it would have been $40 billion. We,107
NA,had a budget surplus of $10 billion. If we,107
NA,had had a budget deficit of four per cent of,107
NA,"rain- GDP, it would have been a $50 billion turn-",107
NA,"around, a $40 billion deficit.",107
NA,"But, in the mind of the member for Lilley,",107
NA,what you actually do in government is not,107
NA,the important thing; what is important is,107
NA,"what the focus groups demand that you do,",107
NA,and you reassure them without actually get-,107
NA,ting into the substantive policy debate. I,107
NA,guess the illustration that brought this home,107
NA,to me more than any other was when this,107
NA,government increased family benefits with,107
NA,an annual $600 payment and announced that,107
NA,we would pay a $600 lump sum in respect of,107
NA,each child where the family was entitled to,107
NA,family tax benefit. The member for Lilley,107
NA,decided that that payment should be abol-,107
NA,"ished. His leader, Mark Latham, said to him,",108
NA,‘How do we explain that we're taking $600 a,108
NA,year away from families?' The member for,108
NA,Lilley said: ‘Tell them it's not real. Tell,108
NA,"they never had a $600 payment, so when you",108
NA,take it away they won't notice it.' This is of,108
NA,course what you would learn as a machine,108
NA,"politician. When you are on weak ground,",108
NA,"claim that black is white, repeat it often",108
NA,enough and you will get people to believe it.,108
NA,You could not fool the Australian public;,108
NA,they knew they were getting $600 as I said-,108
NA,it went into their bank accounts. It could be,108
NA,"spent, it could be drawn out, it could be ex-",108
NA,"changed for milk and bread, and the line that",108
NA,it was not real did not gel with reality. Of,108
NA,course it turned into a disaster during the,108
NA,2004 election.,108
NA,I want to say something briefly about pro-,108
NA,ductivity because I was saying this in the,108
NA,course of question time today. What would,108
NA,you be doing if you wanted to boost produc-,108
NA,tivity in Australia? I think investing in,108
NA,schools will boost productivity in the longer,108
NA,"term because, if you invest in skills and you",108
NA,"train more apprentices, you get more people",108
NA,into the labour force with higher skills. Over,108
NA,"the course of time, you would expect that to",108
NA,"lift capacity. Of course, you have to bear in",108
NA,mind that an apprentice will take four years,108
NA,to train and the apprentice then has to go into,108
NA,the workforce. I think we have something,108
NA,"like 160,000 apprenticeships at the moment,",108
NA,"which is some kind of record in Australia,",108
NA,and that will give you benefits in the long,108
NA,term; there is no doubt about that.,108
NA,"But, if you really want to unlock key pro-",108
NA,"ductivity benefits, you should do it in rela-",108
NA,tion to the existing workforce-not just the,108
NA,"future workforce, not just in five or 10 years",108
NA,"time, but the existing workforce. I have no",108
NA,"doubt that if you improve industrial relations,",108
NA,if you allow employers and employees to,108
NA,"directly agree on AWAs, that will be a much",108
NA,more productive industrial relations system,108
NA,"in each and every factory, shop, business and",108
NA,"company in Australia. But, of course, the",108
NA,Labor Party are against that. If you do not,108
NA,"them want to take my word for it, you could take",108
NA,the word of the former Governor of the Re-,108
NA,"serve Bank, Ian Macfarlane. In his testimony",108
NA,before the House of Representatives shortly,108
NA,"before he ceased being governor, he said:",108
NA,The biggest thing in this area-,108
NA,productivity-,108
NA,is industrial relations reform. There must be a lot,108
NA,of things that still can be done.,108
NA,What did the Reserve Bank Governor say?,108
NA,The biggest area is industrial relations re-,108
NA,form. What is the major plank of Labor's,108
NA,industrial relations policy? To get rid of,108
NA,AWAs. So the Labor Party would have you,108
NA,"believe, on one hand, that they are critical of",108
NA,"the government about productivity and, on",108
NA,"the other hand, that they want to abolish the",108
NA,key thing that can drive it. So how would,108
NA,you reconcile those two positions-that you,108
NA,"allegedly want to increase productivity and,",108
NA,"at the same time, abolish the key thing that",108
NA,would drive it? You do precisely what you,108
NA,did in relation to the $600 payment. You,108
NA,deny the obvious and you repeat over and,108
NA,"over again that it is not real, that it does not",108
NA,"occur, that it does not happen. Australia",108
NA,needs more than focus-group-driven glib,108
NA,cliches. What we need is real policy. What,108
NA,the government delivered last night was real,108
NA,policy. It is the biggest investment that Aus-,108
NA,tralia has ever had. We are going to lock in,108
NA,the gains. We are going to invest for the fu-,108
NA,ture. This is the economic path forward and,108
NA,the coalition will lead it. (Time expired),108
Mr TANNER ,Melbourne) (3.46 pm)-,108
NA,Seven weeks ago the Treasurer stood up at,108
NA,the dispatch box and suddenly became hys-,108
NA,"terical. He screamed, he shouted, he went red",108
NA,"in the face, he frothed at the mouth, he",108
NA,"cursed, he ranted like an old preacher at an",108
NA,AA meeting. We were almost expecting a,108
NA,"round of ‘Away, away with rum by gum.'",109
NA,"You could say that he does this often,",109
NA,was a particularly spectacular performance-,109
NA,"and, by the sound of his rather ponderous",109
NA,"and soporific contribution today, he is proba-",109
NA,bly still recovering. Why was it that he be-,109
NA,came so hysterical? What was the cause of,109
NA,"this outburst of red-facedness, hysteria and",109
NA,ranting? The answer is: Labor's broadband,109
NA,proposal.,109
NA,This proposal includes drawing on $2.7,109
NA,"billion of Telstra shares, one telecommunica-",109
NA,tions asset held by the government in escrow,109
NA,"in the Future Fund, in order to invest in",109
NA,ating the national broadband network that,109
NA,this nation desperately needs and the Howard,109
NA,government has totally failed to deliver. The,109
NA,Treasurer described this as shameful eco-,109
NA,"nomic vandalism, robbery and burglary. He",109
NA,said it was the most economically irrespon-,109
NA,sible thing that Labor has said in 11 years.,109
NA,Fortunately the commentators dismissed this,109
NA,"hysteria as total rubbish and last night, in",109
NA,"effect, the Treasurer and the government",109
NA,completely surrendered. They vacated the,109
NA,field on this assertion that Labor's broadband,109
NA,proposal is economically irresponsible.,109
NA,Why? Because they have effectively done,109
NA,the same thing that Labor was proposing to,109
NA,do with respect to prospective future invest-,109
NA,ments. But they have doubled it. They have,109
NA,taken what would otherwise have been Fu-,109
NA,ture Fund assets of $5 billion plus the earn-,109
NA,ings that would accrue from that between,109
NA,"now and the end of next year, which effec-",109
NA,tively adds up to double what Labor's com-,109
NA,mitment involved. But in true hypocritical,109
NA,preacher style the Treasurer is still trying,109
NA,"pretend he is pure. So in the budget speech,",109
NA,the same speech where he announced this $5,109
NA,"billion drawdown on the Future Fund, he",109
NA,"also said, ‘But we won't be like those irre-",109
NA,sponsible Labor people who propose to draw,109
NA,down $2.7 billion.' Let us run through the,109
NA,quote to make it clear exactly what we are,109
NA,but this dealing with. He said:,109
NA,If you rob capital or earnings from the Future,109
NA,"Fund, taxpayers will have to make up the differ-",109
NA,"ence. You are passing our bills, our obligations,",109
NA,from our generation to the next. This will limit,109
NA,their future. We will strongly oppose any irre-,109
NA,sponsible attempt to raid this national investment,109
NA,for cheap political advantage.,109
NA,"Six weeks ago, in the Australian Financial",109
NA,"Review, the Minister for Finance and Ad-",109
NA,ministration said:,109
NA,Certainly this year's surplus and next year's sur-,109
NA,cre- plus will be going into the Future Fund.,109
NA,So where did this $5 billion for the Higher,109
NA,Education Endowment Fund come from? It,109
NA,came from this year's surplus-the same,109
NA,"surplus that, according to Senator Minchin,",109
NA,was destined for the Future Fund. Whichever,109
NA,"way you look at it, however you play with",109
NA,words-as he sought to do in his press re-,109
NA,lease defending himself this afternoon-that,109
NA,"$5 billion was halfway out the door, heading",109
NA,towards the Future Fund. He grabbed it and,109
NA,said: ‘We're going to have a Higher Educa-,109
NA,tion Endowment Fund. This isn't going into,109
NA,the Future Fund.' So the preacher has gone,109
NA,out and got legless. He is wandering around,109
NA,looking for some alcoholics to convert and,109
NA,lecture about the virtues of abstinence. Labor,109
NA,supports the Higher Education Endowment,109
NA,Fund. It is a reasonable idea. But we should,109
NA,"not get carried away with it, as the Prime",109
NA,"Minister and Treasurer have done, because it",109
NA,is only going to deliver approximately $300,109
NA,"million of, one would hope, new money to",109
NA,the higher education sector each year. A lot,109
NA,"to more needs to be done, but that is not a bad",109
NA,start.,109
NA,But the one thing we can take out of this is,109
NA,that the debate about Labor's broadband pro-,109
NA,posal is over. Not only is the proposal good,109
NA,in the national interest from the point of view,109
NA,of getting that broadband network built; it is,109
NA,entirely responsible financially. But yet again,109
NA,there is virtually nothing in this budget to,110
NA,tackle that chronic productivity problem of,110
NA,our falling behind the rest of the developed,110
NA,world in access to high-speed broadband.,110
NA,The government have now conceded not,110
NA,only that Labor's proposition is good and,110
NA,sound from a communications point of view,110
NA,and a productivity point of view but also that,110
NA,the financing proposal is entirely reason-,110
NA,able-because they are doing exactly the,110
NA,same thing with respect to the headline an-,110
NA,nouncement in this year's budget.,110
NA,In a sense that encapsulates the entire,110
NA,"budget, a budget built on preaching absti-",110
NA,nence and practising incontinence; that is the,110
NA,"entire budget of 2007. Yes, there are many",110
NA,"initiatives that we support, such as the",110
NA,Higher Education Endowment Fund. Some,110
NA,"of them we designed, so why wouldn't we",110
NA,support them? But the wider picture is dif-,110
NA,ferent. The wider picture is of a government,110
NA,that is complacently cruising on the minerals,110
NA,"boom, handing out money every way it can",110
NA,to try to ensure its re-election while not,110
NA,vesting for the future of Australia and for,110
NA,future living standards of our kids and not,110
NA,investing for increasing productivity to en-,110
NA,sure that we stay at the forefront of the,110
NA,world's nations. When the sun is shining you,110
NA,make hay. That is not what this government,110
NA,is doing and that is not what the budget is,110
NA,doing; it fails the future test.,110
NA,We welcome the education initiatives that,110
NA,"are in the budget, but they are, in overall",110
NA,"terms, relatively modest-a good first step.",110
NA,They are good snapshots but they are a long,110
NA,way from being the whole picture. And the,110
NA,government could not help themselves: they,110
NA,had to whack in a little sting in the tail on,110
NA,HECS; they had to slug students on the way,110
NA,through. They had to revert to type and hit,110
NA,"accounting, business and commerce students",110
NA,"with a big HECS slug, because they could",110
NA,not help themselves. Even though they are,110
NA,trying desperately to look like they care,110
NA,about education-they want to improve in-,110
NA,vestment in education because Kevin Rudd,110
NA,has put the issue squarely at the forefront of,110
NA,the national agenda-on the way through,110
NA,they could not help themselves: they had to,110
NA,slug students.,110
NA,We need to examine what has not been,110
NA,tackled in this budget. We need to look at,110
NA,what has not actually occurred. There is very,110
NA,little on vocational education in the middle,110
NA,of a skills crisis. There are a few modest ini-,110
NA,"tiatives with respect to climate change, the",110
NA,most striking of which is about adapting to,110
NA,"climate change, getting used to it-not doing",110
NA,"something about it, not acting, not leading",110
NA,"the world as Australia should be doing, not",110
NA,contributing to a global solution. Early,110
NA,childhood education is critical to the future,110
NA,opportunities of all children but there is ef-,110
NA,"fectively nothing. And, as I said, there is",110
NA,nothing on broadband.,110
NA,"Then, if you look at the wider estimates,",110
NA,the wider projections as to where the nation's,110
NA,"in- economy is heading, you see productivity",110
NA,the effectively at zero and very ordinary produc-,110
NA,tivity figures projected for the future. As to,110
NA,"export growth, they have finally given up on",110
NA,"all of the outrageous, exaggerated export",110
NA,projections that they have put over the past,110
NA,few years when they have kept saying we are,110
NA,going to get eight per cent or nine per cent,110
NA,growth but it turns out to be two per cent.,110
NA,They are backing that down to five. That,110
NA,makes you really worry about what the out-,110
NA,come and the reality will ultimately be in the,110
NA,next few years if they are pulling their pro-,110
NA,"jections down like that, particularly when the",110
NA,projections indicate that the current account,110
NA,deficit is expected to blow out to six per cent,110
NA,again.,110
NA,Unemployment is expected to rise; job,110
NA,creation is expected to fall. It is also impor-,110
NA,tant to look at the wider macrofiscal position,110
NA,to lay to rest once and for all the suggestion,110
NA,"that this is a fiscally conservative, ‘small",111
NA,"government' focused, economic-managing",111
NA,government. Fifty-three billion dollars in,111
NA,additional money has rained down on the,111
NA,government since December. The estimates,111
NA,for the four years have $53 billion more than,111
NA,what was available in the equivalent esti-,111
NA,mates in December. They have spent the lot.,111
NA,"They have used the lot, some on tax cuts and",111
NA,"an awful lot on spending, and they have",111
NA,managed to throw in an additional $4-odd,111
NA,billion of spending at the end of this finan-,111
NA,"cial year, the one that is about to close, not to portance-",111
NA,mention the $5 billion that has been put in,111
NA,there for the Higher Education Endowment,111
NA,Fund. We are getting to the point where we,111
NA,are going to see more new spending initia-,111
NA,tives at the end of a budget than we see at the,111
NA,start. In the financial year that is about to,111
NA,"end, the new spending initiatives that were",111
NA,announced in the 2006 budget for the 2006-,111
NA,07 year were worth about $4 billion. The,111
NA,new spending initiatives for the 2006-07 fi-,111
NA,nancial year announced in the 2007 budget,111
NA,"are also about $4 billion, even if you exclude",111
NA,the one-off capital investment in the higher,111
NA,education fund. This is a very peculiar ap-,111
NA,proach to accounting.,111
NA,There has been virtually no serious effort,111
NA,"to gain savings, to cut expenditure and to",111
NA,ensure that we have rigorous controls on,111
NA,government spending. A lot more money has,111
NA,been handed out to departments such as,111
NA,Treasury and Finance without even any,111
NA,process attached to them as to what they are,111
NA,supposed to be for. The Melbourne Cricket,111
NA,Club has got another $10 million to add to,111
NA,the $15 million it got last year for its mu-,111
NA,"seum, and so the list goes on.",111
NA,The drunken preacher is having a wild,111
NA,time. He is handing out free advice on absti-,111
NA,nence in between swigs of his flagon. He is,111
NA,passing the flagon around and he is having a,111
NA,great time because he has a lot to drink. The,111
NA,"worry is, though, that it will be our kids who",111
NA,"get the hangover, because when this nation",111
NA,was in a position of enormous good for-,111
NA,tune-of great fortune with huge revenues,111
NA,coming in to the government from the min-,111
NA,ing boom-what did the government do?,111
NA,They squandered it and they are continuing,111
NA,to squander it. Don't be fooled by the fact,111
NA,that they are trying to look as if they are do-,111
NA,"ing something, because this budget fails the",111
NA,future test. (Time expired),111
Mr CIOBO ,Moncrieff) (3.57 pm)-I am,111
NA,pleased to rise on this matter of public im-,111
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jen-,111
NA,"kins)-Member for Moncrieff, is your mi-",111
NA,crophone on?,111
NA,Mr Murphy-We're not missing any-,111
NA,thing!,111
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,111
NA,member for Lowe is not helping. The Deputy,111
NA,Clerk will start the clock again. I will call the,111
NA,member for Moncrieff now that we have,111
NA,sorted that out.,111
Mr CIOBO," Mr Deputy Speaker, we",111
NA,have worked out what the problem is: the,111
NA,member for Melbourne actually put the mi-,111
NA,crophone operator to sleep. That is a new,111
NA,record. In the six years that I have been in,111
NA,the parliament I have never actually seen a,111
NA,member of the opposition put a console op-,111
NA,erator to sleep. Congratulations to the mem-,111
NA,ber for Melbourne! It is a new record to the,111
NA,member for Melbourne: not only was he so,111
NA,boring and his speech so devoid of any fact,111
NA,but he actually managed to give it in such a,111
NA,monotonous way that he sent one of the con-,111
NA,sole operators to sleep. My heart is with the,111
NA,console operator. But for the fact that I am,111
NA,paid to sit in this chamber and have to pay,111
NA,"attention, I would have liked to have fallen",111
NA,"asleep as well, although I would have had",111
NA,some sort of recurring nightmare as I heard,111
NA,the member for Melbourne drone on and on,111
NA,and on.,111
NA,"Notwithstanding that, I am very pleased to",112
NA,stand up to speak on the MPI that is before,112
NA,the chamber today. I was fascinated by one,112
NA,small part of what the member for Mel-,112
NA,bourne had to say in the topsy-turvy Tanner,112
NA,approach to economics. We have got the,112
NA,member for Melbourne coming to the dis-,112
NA,"patch box saying, ‘You know what: Labor",112
NA,and the coalition are as one when it comes to,112
NA,the Future Fund and investment in broad-,112
NA,band.' What we know from topsy-turvy Tan-,112
NA,ner economics is that they say it is okay to,112
NA,have money in the Future Fund and to take,112
NA,that money from the Future Fund and go off,112
NA,"and spend it, because that is the same thing",112
NA,as having money in the Future Fund and then,112
NA,establishing an additional endowment fund.,112
NA,"In other words, what are we actually talking",112
NA,about?,112
NA,"The member for Melbourne is saying that,",112
NA,if you have $100 in a savings account and,112
NA,"you take out $50 and go and spend it, it is the",112
NA,same principle that members of the coalition,112
NA,have put forward. What are the coalition do-,112
NA,ing? They have put $100 in a savings ac-,112
NA,count and are now opening a second savings,112
NA,account and putting in an additional $50.,112
NA,"According to the Australian Labor Party, to",112
NA,have $100 in one savings account and $50 in,112
NA,a second savings account is apparently the,112
NA,"same as having $100 in an account, with-",112
NA,drawing $50 and spending it. That is what,112
NA,the member for Melbourne said to the cham-,112
NA,"ber this afternoon, and it is for that very",112
NA,son that the Australian Labor Party is abso-,112
NA,lutely laughable when it comes to having the,112
NA,discipline or economic sense to manage the,112
NA,Australian economy.,112
NA,The Treasurer said today that you cannot,112
NA,trust Labor when it comes to managing Aus-,112
NA,tralia's trillion dollar economy because it is,112
NA,just too important. We know that the mem-,112
NA,bers for Lilley and Melbourne have both,112
NA,"clearly demonstrated that, when it comes to",112
NA,"having discipline, to rolling up the sleeves,",112
NA,getting up early and doing the work required,112
NA,to manage Australia's trillion dollar econ-,112
NA,"omy, the Labor Party just do not have it. If",112
NA,"you want proof positive, the Labor Party",112
NA,would ruin the Australian economy with not,112
NA,only their talk of $600 ‘not being real,112
NA,money' but also their comment that having,112
NA,one savings account and starting a second,112
NA,savings account is the same as taking money,112
NA,out of a savings account. It beggars belief.,112
NA,We hear from the Australian Labor Party that,112
NA,it is the same thing; it is not even remotely,112
NA,similar!,112
NA,The Australian Labor Party's proposition,112
NA,on broadband-and we heard much talk,112
NA,about broadband from both the member for,112
NA,Lilley and the member for Melbourne-is,112
NA,"very clear, and it is nothing like what this",112
NA,government is doing with the endowment,112
NA,fund. The Australian Labor Party's approach,112
NA,"to the Future Fund is to say, ‘We will extract",112
NA,money from the Future Fund and spend it.',112
NA,Their initial approach was that $2.7 billion,112
NA,was going to be used on broadband rollout-,112
NA,"which, incidentally, the Australian Labor",112
NA,Party were going to steal from the Future,112
NA,Fund. That $2.7 billion smash and grab was,112
NA,going to be used to invest in a network that,112
NA,two private operators in Australia are looking,112
NA,at rolling out themselves. Not only have we,112
NA,got the Australian Labor Party smashing and,112
NA,grabbing from the future savings of Austra-,112
NA,lian generations; we have them investing that,112
NA,reamoney in a broadband network that two pri-,112
NA,vate operators are lining up to roll out today.,112
NA,That is the Australian Labor Party's ap-,112
NA,proach.,112
NA,This government has turned around and,112
NA,"said, ‘We quarantined the money in the Fu-",112
NA,ture Fund.' We do not want the burden of,112
NA,retirees in the future-service men and,112
NA,"women from Australia's defence forces, and",112
NA,public servants. We are building up retire-,112
NA,ment savings for them in the Future Fund.,112
NA,to We do not want future generations of Austra-,112
NA,"lians to have to shoulder that burden, so we",113
NA,will start making provision today. The Future,113
NA,Fund is a savings account that we have,113
NA,opened today to provide for all of our tomor-,113
NA,"rows, and we have done it again with the",113
NA,endowment fund.,113
NA,The $5 billion visionary endowment fund,113
NA,that the Treasurer announced last night will,113
NA,"ensure that, in perpetuity, Australian univer-",113
NA,sities have access to capital to ensure that,113
NA,Australia can have world-class and first-class,113
NA,research institutions and teaching facilities,113
NA,and a whole spate of new initiatives available,113
NA,to our tertiary education sector. We can have,113
NA,world-class facilities that will ensure that,113
NA,Australian kids in the future can be not only,113
NA,among the best in our region but among the,113
NA,"best in the world, with access to the very best",113
NA,technology and the very best teaching facili-,113
NA,ties at our universities. That is what this,113
NA,ernment has set up under the $5 billion en-,113
NA,dowment fund.,113
NA,What is the Labor Party's response to,113
NA,"that? They say that they support it, but in fact",113
NA,they would approach it by stealing more,113
NA,money out of the Future Fund. The Labor,113
NA,Party's approach is not to create additional,113
NA,savings but to spend even more money. We,113
NA,know that the Australian Labor Party's ap-,113
NA,proach to the budget is really distilled down,113
NA,to a couple of basic elements. Their criticism,113
NA,has been that we have not spent enough as a,113
NA,"government, so they say, ‘Spend more",113
NA,money.' The other criticisms that have come,113
NA,from the Australian Labor Party are that the,113
NA,surplus was not big enough and that we,113
NA,should have saved more money. Spend more,113
NA,money; save more money-that is all we,113
NA,hear from the Australian Labor Party.,113
NA,When we get to the issue of our environ-,113
NA,"ment, it is important to recognise that this",113
NA,coalition government is proposing to spend,113
NA,$19 billion on Australia's environment over,113
NA,the next four years-$19 billion of invest-,113
NA,ment in Australia's environment and those of,113
NA,our surrounding neighbours. A key plank of,113
NA,this government's approach to combating the,113
NA,effect of climate change is to look at some of,113
NA,the source problems affecting climate,113
NA,change. We know that one of the key issues,113
NA,is deforestation that is taking place around,113
NA,the world. I am proud to be a part of a gov-,113
NA,ernment that is working with poorer nations,113
NA,around the world and with some of our near,113
NA,neighbours to put in place incentives to try to,113
NA,stop them from cutting down trees-a very,113
NA,good initiative. It is the kind of initiative that,113
NA,will have a long-term benefit for our nation.,113
NA,It is a world-leading initiative that the mem-,113
NA,ber for Melbourne was talking about earlier.,113
NA,This country is leading and setting an exam-,113
NA,ple for the world. We are doing it by focus-,113
NA,ing not only within Australia but also on our,113
NA,"govnear neighbours, and saying to them, ‘We",113
NA,will work with you. We will create an incen-,113
NA,tive so that we do not end up with vast hec-,113
NA,tares of deforested land because you have,113
NA,people in your countries who are chopping,113
NA,down trees faster than we can plant them,113
NA,here.' That is the kind of world leadership,113
NA,that I am pleased to be part of.,113
NA,"One of the single biggest, most glaring er-",113
NA,rors that we have seen from the Australian,113
NA,Labor Party is their standing up and saying it,113
NA,has been raining gold bullion for this How-,113
NA,ard government. We hear the Australian La-,113
NA,"bor Party say, ‘It's all just a coincidence; it's",113
NA,all just a fluke.' The reality is that the Austra-,113
NA,lian Labor Party have stood opposed to every,113
NA,major reform measure that this government,113
NA,has tried to introduce since 1996. The Aus-,113
NA,tralian Labor Party stood opposed to tax re-,113
NA,form. The Australian Labor Party stood op-,113
NA,posed to waterfront reform. The Australian,113
NA,Labor Party stood opposed to the tax reform,113
NA,that took place under the GST. The Austra-,113
NA,lian Labor Party even opposed tax cuts for,113
NA,Australians in the previous budget. That is,113
NA,the Australian Labor Party's record. When it,113
NA,came to industrial relations reform-for ex-,114
NA,"ample, unfair dismissal laws-the Australian",114
NA,"Labor Party opposed that as well, and they",114
NA,are opposing Work Choices now. On every,114
NA,"single front, the Australian Labor Party have",114
NA,stood opposed to the initiatives this govern-,114
NA,"ment has undertaken, the kinds of initiatives",114
NA,that have delivered in spades to the Austra-,114
NA,lian people-that have kept our budget in the,114
NA,"black, got unemployment down to a 30-year",114
NA,record low and delivered the dividend that,114
NA,the Australian people enjoyed last night in,114
NA,the Treasurer's speech.,114
Mr BOWEN ,Prospect) (4.07 pm)-Last,114
NA,"week Australia had a very eminent visitor, a",114
NA,"respected commentator on globalisation, the",114
NA,author of one of the world's best-selling,114
NA,"books in recent times-Thomas Friedman,",114
NA,the author of the book The World is Flat. He,114
NA,"met with the Prime Minister, he met with the",114
NA,Leader of the Opposition and he addressed a,114
NA,big dinner in Sydney-,114
NA,Mr Hockey interjecting-,114
Mr BOWEN,The minister was at the,114
NA,dinner and they may have met individually.,114
NA,Mr Hockey interjecting-,114
Mr BOWEN,They met individually; I,114
NA,am glad to hear it. The minister and several,114
NA,"other ministers were at the dinner, as were",114
NA,"shadow ministers, and we heard about Mr",114
NA,Friedman's views on what makes a success-,114
NA,ful nation in this difficult time around the,114
NA,world. An interesting quote has been brought,114
NA,to my attention. Thomas Friedman says this:,114
NA,"Money, jobs, and opportunity in the flat world",114
NA,will go to the countries with the best infrastructo,114
NA,"ture, the best education system that produces the",114
NA,"most educated work force, the most investor-",114
NA,"friendly laws, and the best environment.",114
NA,Last night's budget fails the Thomas Fried-,114
NA,man test because it fails the future test-,114
NA,Mr Hockey interjecting-,114
Mr BOWEN,and the minister knows it.,114
NA,The minister knows that last night was an-,114
NA,other squandered opportunity from a gov-,114
NA,"ernment which is riding the mining boom,",114
NA,"taking the Chinese dividend, and refusing to",114
NA,invest and prepare Australia for the downturn,114
NA,which will inevitably come in this nation. It,114
NA,is a government which is ignoring the pro-,114
NA,ductivity gap which has not only existed but,114
NA,has been rising under this government for,114
NA,several years; a government which ignores-,114
NA,and has ignored for 11 years-the need for a,114
NA,massive reinvestment in Australia's educa-,114
NA,"tion system. At five minutes to midnight, five",114
NA,"months before an election, they suddenly",114
NA,rediscover the need to invest in education.,114
NA,"Well, it is not enough.",114
NA,It is not enough to catch up. Australia has,114
NA,to do better than that. A catch-up is wel-,114
NA,come-we welcome some of the funds going,114
NA,to education in last night's budget-but a,114
NA,catch-up is not enough. And the Australian,114
NA,people will not be fooled by a cynical and,114
NA,cunning budget at five minutes to midnight,114
NA,which finally recognises the need to invest in,114
NA,education. It does not go far enough-on any,114
NA,measure.,114
NA,I was in the budget lockup yesterday and I,114
NA,"thought, ‘I'll look up the early childhood",114
NA,measures; I'll find out how much new money,114
NA,is going into early childhood.' And I looked,114
NA,and I looked and I looked through the budget,114
NA,"papers, locked away in the room-not one.",114
NA,Every respected economic commentator in,114
NA,the world says that one of the best ways to,114
NA,invest in a nation's future is to invest early-,114
NA,invest in early childhood education; to,114
NA,take people in their first two or three years,114
NA,and give them the best possible start in life.,114
NA,That is why Labor has committed to a mul-,114
NA,timillion-dollar early childhood investment,114
NA,plan. Yet there was not one word on that in,114
NA,"the budget. I thought, ‘Maybe the govern-",114
NA,ment will try to catch up; maybe they will,114
NA,"respond,' but there was not one word on that.",114
NA,Australia's overall investment in educa-,115
NA,tion is 5.8 per cent of GDP-behind 17 other,115
NA,OECD nations. That is not changed by this,115
NA,budget. We are behind Hungary-still behind,115
NA,them. We are behind Poland. We are still,115
NA,behind New Zealand. We are still behind 17,115
NA,other OECD nations when it comes to in-,115
NA,vestment in education. As the honourable,115
NA,member for Perth pointed out in question,115
NA,"time, we welcome the $5 billion Higher",115
NA,Education Endowment Fund. That means an,115
NA,average allocation between Australia's 38,115
NA,higher education institutions of about $8 mil-,115
NA,"lion. Now, that is welcome. But let us not kid",115
NA,ourselves that that is enough. Let us not kid,115
NA,ourselves that that is going to make up for,115
NA,the backlog of investment in capital infra-,115
NA,structure in universities in this nation. The,115
NA,government are kidding themselves that it is,115
NA,"enough, but it simply is not.",115
NA,I looked through the budget papers for,115
NA,higher investment in broadband funding. I,115
NA,looked and I looked and I looked-not one,115
NA,"word; not one cent. And then, in question",115
NA,"time, I realised why: it is because the gov-",115
NA,ernment just does not get it. We got up here,115
NA,and we pointed out the connection between,115
NA,education and broadband. We pointed out,115
NA,that children in regional areas need access,115
NA,high-speed broadband to help them with,115
NA,their education-and there was laughter from,115
NA,the other side; guffaws of laughter at the,115
NA,connection being made by this side of the,115
NA,House between education and broadband.,115
NA,They just do not get it.,115
NA,The honourable member for Moncrieff,115
NA,called Labor's plan to invest in a broadband,115
NA,network for this nation ‘theft'. He used all,115
NA,sorts of other pejoratives to describe Labor's,115
NA,plans. He does not get it. And nobody on the,115
NA,other side of the House seems to get the con-,115
NA,nection between the need to connect 98 per,115
NA,"cent of the Australian people to broadband,",115
NA,the need to increase broadband speeds by 40,115
NA,"times, and the impact that will have on Aus-",115
NA,tralia's education outcomes. But we get it.,115
NA,(Time expired),115
Mr HARTSUYKER ,Cowper) (4.13,115
NA,pm)-I certainly disagree most strongly with,115
NA,the proposition put by the member for Pros-,115
NA,pect that the budget fails what he calls ‘the,115
NA,Friedman test' in preparing this country for,115
NA,"the future, because nothing could be further",115
NA,from the truth. We have heard nothing from,115
NA,the opposition-up until recently-other,115
NA,than hot air and rhetoric.,115
NA,An unusual thing happened at the ALP,115
NA,conference. We saw a couple of things start-,115
NA,ing to occur. We saw the Leader of the Op-,115
NA,position make it pretty clear that he takes the,115
NA,vote of the Australian people for granted. We,115
NA,also saw the Leader of the Opposition cast,115
NA,doubt on the ability of someone of a particu-,115
NA,lar chronological age to function at a high,115
NA,level in this community. If you went to a fo-,115
NA,cus group and asked them the question: ‘If,115
NA,"someone is a certain age, does that mean",115
NA,they cannot run a country or they cannot run,115
NA,a major corporation?' they would tell you,115
NA,very strongly that they certainly can. And,115
NA,there is very strong objection to that notion,115
NA,put by the Leader of the Opposition that if,115
NA,you grew up in the era of black-and-white,115
NA,to television you are somehow less worthy to,115
NA,hold high office than if you were a child of,115
NA,the era of colour television.,115
NA,We also saw at the ALP conference a shift,115
NA,from hot air and rhetoric to their first piece,115
NA,of black-letter policy. We saw them move,115
NA,away from the rivers of milk and honey and,115
NA,the endless discussion of warmth and light to,115
NA,put out a policy. What was it? An industrial,115
NA,relations policy. Was it going to build pro-,115
NA,ductivity? I think not. Was it going to take,115
NA,this country forward? I think not. The first,115
NA,piece of black-letter policy that they brought,115
NA,"out did not take this country forward but, in",115
NA,"fact, took it back some 20 years. We got to",115
NA,the point where Labor were going to produce,115
NA,this piece of policy that would bring us back,116
NA,to the great old days of centralised wage,116
NA,ing. They were going to make reforms they,116
NA,were going to turn back AWAs. We know-,116
NA,and I see the Minister for Employment and,116
NA,"Workplace Relations at the table, and he cer-",116
NA,tainly knows-that AWAs provide more,116
NA,flexibility for employers to come up with,116
NA,arrangements with their employees to maxi-,116
NA,mise the production and productivity of this,116
NA,country. And to take away a major element,116
NA,"of the growth of this nation, through taking",116
NA,"away AWAs, can hardly be setting up this",116
NA,country for growth and taking this country,116
NA,forward.,116
NA,We saw the folly in Labor's first venture,116
NA,into policy when they had to review their,116
NA,own policy some five times within 10 days.,116
NA,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition must,116
NA,be embarrassed by what is considered by,116
NA,most commentators as an absolutely woeful,116
NA,foray into detailed policy. The government,116
NA,believes that greater flexibility is greater,116
NA,"productivity, but Labor want to introduce",116
NA,"union rule by good old team ACTU, that",116
NA,great bastion of flexibility. If you want to,116
NA,look at productivity you have to look no,116
NA,"ther than the commercial building industry,",116
NA,where we hear of reductions in cost in com-,116
NA,mercial building of some 20 to 30 per cent,116
NA,"through fewer industrial disputes, through",116
NA,less intimidation and thuggery on work sites,116
NA,and through improved work practices.,116
NA,What is Labor's response to this improved,116
NA,"flexibility, improved productivity and re-",116
NA,duced cost on commercial building sites?,116
NA,They want to abolish the Australian Building,116
NA,and Construction Commission. They want to,116
NA,go back to good old team ACTU. Bring back,116
NA,"union thuggery, revitalise union power: ‘We",116
NA,want to have the crane drivers running the,116
NA,"construction sites again, deciding what goes",116
NA,up the building and what comes down. We,116
NA,want to have the crane drivers holding up the,116
NA,"job, costing tens of thousands of dollars in",116
NA,prolongation costs.' That is the response of,116
NA,fixthe Labor Party to improved productivity,116
NA,that has been brought about by these sorts of,116
NA,changes. It is the peak of hypocrisy for Labor,116
NA,"to talk of productivity growth, when the first",116
NA,policy that they bring out takes this country,116
NA,back 20 years.,116
NA,This budget has introduced a range of,116
NA,measures that will drive this country for-,116
NA,ward. This government is very much on the,116
NA,leading edge of improved productivity. You,116
NA,are a very backward-looking opposition. You,116
NA,"have no real solutions, apart from hot air and",116
NA,rhetoric. We have seen you on climate,116
NA,"change. It is all warm and fuzzy, but there is",116
NA,nothing beneath that never-ending rhetoric,116
NA,that you put out. This government is taking,116
NA,this country forward in an economically re-,116
NA,sponsible way and the people of Australia,116
NA,see through your-,116

NA,before it is concluded instead of requiring a,117

NA,the Main Committee. Whilst we in the Labor,117
NA,Party are certainly happy to facilitate the use,117
NA,"of the Main Committee to consider business,",117
NA,it is surprising because the government has,117
NA,"not been prioritising business at all. Indeed,",117
NA,"in the last sitting, just six weeks ago, the",117
NA,"week before parliament rose, the Main Com-",117
NA,mittee barely had any business to consider at,117
NA,"all. On the Wednesday, all we had was a se-",117
NA,ries of three-minute statements from mem-,118

NA,Nothing could better illustrate the fact that,118
NA,"this government is short of ideas, it is short",118
NA,"of legislation, it is out of touch and it is",118
NA,of time. Nothing could better illustrate that,118
NA,"fact. The Leader of the House, the member",118
NA,"for Warringah, never does his job. He gets",118
NA,other people to do it for him. He cannot be,118
NA,bothered moving motions that are appropri-,118
NA,ately moved by the Leader of the House in,118
NA,this chamber. He simply gets his colleague-,118
NA,Ms Macklin-Where is he?,118
Mr ALBANESE,He's out jogging. That,118
NA,is where he usually is at this time of the day.,118
NA,This is a government-,118
NA,"Mr Hockey- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise",118
NA,on a point of order. If the Manager of Oppo-,118
NA,sition Business wants to engage in a debate,118
NA,"about the fitness of the Leader of the House,",118
NA,"I am happy to engage in a debate about that,",118
NA,but I would like to hear him come back to,118

The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Jen-,118
NA,"kins)-The minister will resume his seat,",118
NA,and I am sure the member for Grayndler will,118
NA,be relevant to the question before the House.,118
Mr ALBANESE,I certainly will. It is,118
NA,not surprising that government ministers are,118
NA,embarrassed. They are embarrassed by their,118
NA,own performance-embarrassed about ex-,118
NA,tending the sittings of the Main Committee,118
NA,when there is no legislation before the Main,118
NA,Committee to consider. It is extraordinary.,118
NA,We can remember back to previous times,118
NA,"before elections in 2004, 2001 and 1998. The",118
NA,House was full of legislation. There was a,118
NA,battle of ideas. What do we see from this,118
NA,government? This is a government that is out,118
NA,"of ideas and out of legislation. Indeed, the",118
NA,only legislation that it has before this House,118
NA,to consider tends to be legislation amending,118
NA,"its own legislation, such as Work Choices,",118
NA,because it has got the fundamentals of its,118
NA,legislation wrong. Surely the first step should,118
NA,be ensuring that the Main Committee does,118
NA,not sit vacant like it did during the last ses-,118
NA,out sion. The government is putting the cart be-,118
NA,fore the horse. You actually need some legis-,118
NA,lation before you expand the sittings of the,118
NA,Main Committee. This is in contrast to the,118
NA,solid legislative agenda that Labor has been,118
NA,"outlining all year on climate change, on ad-",118
NA,"dressing our water crisis, on broadband and",118
NA,on education. I would encourage the gov-,118
NA,ernment to actually refer the private mem-,118
NA,ber's bill that we have to ratify the Kyoto,118
NA,"protocol, for example, to the Main Commit-",118
NA,tee for full debate and then have a vote on it,118
NA,rather than sitting on this legislation and re-,118
NA,fusing to allow votes in this chamber or,118
NA,proper debate.,118
NA,"It is very clear, and we saw it again today",118
NA,when he was asked a question about the fu-,118
NA,"ture of education, that the prime minister's",118
NA,response is all about the past. His response,118
NA,was all about the 1990s-when we were,118
NA,talking about the budget here and through the,118
NA,forward estimates years to 2010-11. So we,118
NA,welcome the opportunity to have more de-,118
NA,bate and we will be engaging in it. But we,118
NA,say to the government: if you are going to,118
NA,increase sitting times and make these,118
NA,changes then let us have more debate on the,118
NA,"policy differences, which are stark, in this",118
NA,election year: the policy differences on ad-,118
NA,"dressing our skills crisis, on addressing infra-",118
NA,"structure, on the education revolution, on",118
NA,"providing broadband, on addressing climate",118
NA,"change and the water crisis, on addressing all",118
NA,these issues-,118
NA,Mr Hockey-And industrial relations.,118
Mr ALBANESE,and on making sure,118
NA,that we have a fair workplace relations sys-,118
NA,tem for Australia. What I would like to de-,118
NA,"bate as well is the failure of this government,",118
NA,"when it comes to industrial relations, to ad-",118
NA,dress the issue of those workers from Tristar,119
NA,in my electorate. This government sat on its,119
NA,hands. I asked questions of the Prime Minis-,119
NA,"ter last year. We had a delegation, a busload,",119
NA,of workers from Tristar down here and the,119
NA,government refused to see them. It only no-,119
NA,ticed that this was an issue when Alan Jones,119
NA,and other people in the media took it up. The,119
NA,minister asked for a debate on these issues,119
NA,but he does not like hearing-,119
NA,Mr Hockey-I rise on a point of order.,119
NA,Not only is the member factually incorrect,119
NA,but the matter is actually before the courts. I,119
NA,"would urge the member to bear in mind that,",119
NA,"because the matter is before the courts, we",119
NA,should not prejudice the court proceedings,119
NA,with debate.,119
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,119
NA,chair is in the invidious position of not,119
NA,knowing at what stage the legal proceedings,119
NA,"are. If there are matters before the court, I",119
NA,would hope that the member for Grayndler,119
NA,recognises that and couches his words in,119

Mr ALBANESE,"I assure you, Mr Dep-",119
NA,"uty Speaker, that I certainly do. What is not",119
NA,before the courts is the fact that I asked,119
NA,tions of the Prime Minister and the Prime,119
NA,Minister dismissed them out of hand. What is,119
NA,not before the courts is the fact that a busload,119
NA,of workers from Tristar came here last year. I,119
NA,asked a question while they were in the gal-,119
NA,lery and the government refused to see them.,119
NA,That is a fact. That is not before the courts;,119
NA,that is an absolute fact. The minister opposite,119
NA,said that he wanted more time in the Main,119
NA,Committee and in this chamber to talk about,119
NA,industrial relations. He suggested that. I took,119
NA,it up. The first time I did there were objec-,119
NA,"tions, points of order and attempts to shut",119
NA,down debate.,119
NA,Mr Hockey interjecting-,119
Mr ALBANESE,I will continue to talk,119
NA,"about Tristar, as I have been doing now for",119
NA,more than a year.,119
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honour-,119
NA,able member will refer his remarks through,119
NA,the chair. The minister might assist by ceas-,119
NA,ing to interject.,119
Mr ALBANESE,I believe that I have a,119
NA,"responsibility to represent those people, be-",119
NA,cause they were not going to get any repre-,119
NA,sentation from the other side. The fact is that,119
NA,we are prepared to support this motion ex-,119
NA,tending the time of sittings for the Main,119
NA,Committee. We are prepared to facilitate,119
NA,these debates. We are prepared to ensure that,119
NA,every opportunity is taken to talk about the,119
NA,forward-looking agenda that Kevin Rudd and,119
NA,Labor are pursuing. I commend the changes,119
NA,to the House. I suggest to the government,119
NA,"and, through the minister, to the absent",119
NA,Leader of the House that to fill in this time in,119
NA,future we would be quite happy to debate the,119
NA,pieces of legislation that we have sitting on,119
NA,"the Notice Paper, because that legislation",119
NA,represents the fact that we are ready to gov-,119
NA,ern Australia into the future.,119
NA,NA,119
NA,"quesfirstly, to endorse the remarks of the Man-",119
NA,ager of Opposition Business in the House. I,119
NA,"observe, like he did, that normal practice is",119
NA,of course that these changes to standing or-,119
NA,"ders, which affect every member of this",119
NA,"place, are moved by the Leader of the House",119
NA,"or, in his absence, the Deputy Leader of the",119
NA,House. There is nothing particularly wrong,119
NA,with a minister introducing these changes.,119
NA,"However, one does assume that he would at",119
NA,least explain to the House what the changes,119
NA,were. I find it a tad ironic that he took a point,119
NA,of order on relevance about changes to stand-,119
NA,ing orders that he did not understand or was,119
NA,unable to explain to the House. Be that as it,119
NA,"may, these are a minor but significant change",119
NA,because they allow what is effectively a pri-,119
NA,vate members' Monday in the Main Commit-,120
NA,tee to parallel what is in the chamber should,120
NA,the legislative load be such that government,120
NA,bills can be debated on that sitting Monday.,120
NA,Priority of course is given to private mem-,120
NA,bers' business.,120
NA,We have seen increasing changes to what,120
NA,is actually being done in the Main Commit-,120
NA,tee. This enhances the role and the impor-,120
NA,tance of the Main Committee. Like the Man-,120
NA,"ager of Opposition Business, I certainly hope",120
NA,that the government has a legislative pro-,120
NA,gram which in fact would enable the Main,120
NA,Committee to be fully utilised and afford,120
NA,members the opportunity to debate legisla-,120
NA,tion. The minister at the table said that he,120
NA,wanted to have a debate on industrial rela-,120
NA,"tions. I was wondering, for my own edifica-",120
NA,"tion, when the new legislation that he has",120
NA,announced will come in and when we will,120

Ms MACKLIN ,Jagajaga) (4.34 pm)-,121
NA,The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs,121
NA,Legislation Amendment (One-off Payments,121
NA,and Other 2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007,121
NA,"provides a one-off, non-taxable bonus pay-",121
NA,ment of $500 to each person qualified for,121
NA,utilities allowance or seniors concession al-,121
NA,lowance on budget night. Labor supports this,121
NA,one-off bonus payment to these concession,121
NA,card holders because they certainly deserve,121
NA,"this money, and many of them are struggling",121
NA,to make ends meet. The bill will provide,121
NA,$500 before the end of this financial year to,121
NA,all age pensioners and to those self-funded,121
NA,"retirees earning less than $50,000 for singles",121
NA,"or $80,000 for couples combined.",121
NA,We certainly support this initiative. We,121
NA,know that there have been significant in-,121
NA,"creases in the cost of living, and I am sure",121
NA,"that, when all members of parliament are out",121
NA,in our shopping centres talking with con-,121
NA,"stituents, they hear on a regular basis how",121
NA,"difficult it is for seniors, in particular, to",121
NA,make ends meet given the ongoing rises in,121
NA,"food prices. In the last quarter, in March",121
NA,prices rose by 4.6 per cent. This was particu-,121
NA,"larly due to increases in fruit prices, which",121
NA,rose by almost 15 per cent. It is not surpris-,121
NA,ing that we often hear from seniors in our,121
NA,electorates about how difficult it is for them,121
NA,to manage. The price of petrol and other very,121
NA,important utilities and basics that people,121
NA,need just to manage from week to week have,121
NA,also risen.,121
NA,We also know that our seniors provide the,121
NA,backbone for many of the voluntary organi-,121
NA,sations in our community and spend a lot of,121
NA,"their own money, especially on petrol, going",121
NA,to help out those in even greater need in our,121
NA,"community, visiting and providing support",121
NA,for the very aged and for others who are on,121
NA,their own. This $500 payment will provide,121
NA,that extra bit of help that I am sure the re-,121
NA,cipients will appreciate. The payment will,121
NA,also go to those of service pension age re-,121
NA,"ceiving, as I mentioned, the utilities allow-",121
NA,ance or the seniors concessional allowance,121
NA,and to those receiving the mature age allow-,121
NA,"ance, the widows allowance and the partner",121
NA,allowance. All of those people will receive,121
NA,the payment before the end of June.,121
NA,This bill also provides payments to a wide,121
NA,range of carers. We know that in many cir-,121
NA,cumstances they too are working extremely,121
NA,hard to care for their loved ones. A payment,121
NA,"of $1,000 will be made to carers who are",121
NA,currently receiving the carer payment. Re-,121
NA,cipients of the carer allowance will receive a,121
NA,payment of $600 for every eligible care re-,121
NA,ceiver. In addition to the $600 carer allow-,121
NA,"ance bonus, recipients of the carer allowance",121
NA,who also receive the wife pension or the De-,121
NA,partment of Veterans' Affairs partner service,121
NA,"pension will receive a payment of $1,000.",121
NA,The last three budgets have provided similar,121
NA,one-off lump sum bonuses to eligible carers.,121
NA,We certainly welcome these payments be-,121
NA,"cause we know that, as with seniors, many",121
NA,carers are finding it difficult to make ends,121
NA,"food meet-and, of course, it is very hard for",121
NA,them to find time to be able to earn any,121
NA,money. We know that they also have signifi-,121
NA,cant extra costs because of their caring re-,121
NA,sponsibilities.,121
NA,I am sure that I speak for all members of,121
NA,parliament when I say that many carers feel,121
NA,that their work is undervalued. I think people,121
NA,"often feel that way because, in the vast ma-",121
NA,"jority of cases, their work is carried out be-",121
NA,"hind closed doors, in people's homes. I do",121
NA,not think they feel that they are well under-,121
NA,"stood. Also, an increasing number of women",121
NA,aged between 35 and 54-often called the,121
NA,‘sandwich generation'-are being asked to,121
NA,provide most of the care needed by their,121
NA,"children and by frail older people who are,",121
NA,"most often, related to them. We do have a",121
NA,"rapidly ageing population in Australia, so we",121
NA,can only expect that the number of people,121
NA,who will need to be cared for in this way will,121
NA,increase. There are about 2.6 million carers,122
NA,in Australia. I hope that the support that this,122
NA,bill will provide to them will give them the,122
NA,recognition that they deserve and that bit of,122
NA,extra relief to help them meet the heavy load,122
NA,that they carry.,122
NA,"A major study done in 2006, called the",122
NA,"AMP.NATSEM study, found that the average",122
NA,"carer is $5,600 worse off each year compared",122
NA,with someone with no caring responsibilities.,122
NA,We also know that one in every seven Aus-,122
NA,tralians is providing primary or informal care,122
NA,for an older frail relative or one with a dis-,122
NA,"ability. As I mentioned before, most of that",122
NA,burden is still falling on women. The report,122
NA,also goes into the expectation that these re-,122
NA,sponsibilities will increase as the population,122
NA,ages. This will happen at the same time that,122
NA,we see an increase in the need for women to,122
NA,"participate in the workforce, which is also",122
NA,related to the ageing of the population. The,122
NA,responsibilities that those women will have,122
NA,to carry-workforce responsibilities and car-,122
NA,ing responsibilities for their children and,122
NA,ageing parents-are likely to increase. We,122
NA,also know that carers are more often than not,122
NA,family members and that it is often the case,122
NA,that the carer is an elderly person them-,122
NA,selves. I certainly know from my own fam-,122
NA,ily's circumstances that that can be an enor-,122
NA,mous responsibility as well as a very heavy,122
NA,load. Carers are doing this day in and day,122
NA,out-and often during the night as well when,122
NA,it involves the support of someone who is,122
NA,frail or ill.,122
NA,The bill also contains a number of meas-,122
NA,ures to support veterans and war widows and,122
NA,"widowers, and I want to go through each of",122
NA,those. Schedule 5 of the bill will make one-,122
NA,off payments on 1 January 2007 to Austra-,122
NA,lian former prisoners of war in Europe or,122
NA,their surviving widows. We certainly wel-,122
NA,come this initiative. I notice that the Labor,122
NA,"shadow minister is at the table, and he will",122
NA,strongly endorse my remarks that this pay-,122
NA,"ment is long overdue. Unfortunately, the",122
NA,government left these Australian prisoners of,122
NA,war from Japan and Korea out of the first,122
NA,two ex gratia payments in 2001 and 2004. I,122
NA,am pleased to see that that oversight has now,122
NA,been rectified.,122
NA,The bill will also increase the maximum,122
NA,"funeral benefit from $1,000 to $2,000 for",122
NA,eligible veterans under the Veterans' Enti-,122
NA,"tlements Act 1986. Once again, we welcome",122
NA,this initiative. We know-my colleague at,122
NA,the table is very well aware of this-that the,122
NA,funeral benefit has been a longstanding con-,122
NA,"cern in the veterans community, and this ini-",122
NA,tiative is certainly a step in the right direc-,122
NA,tion.,122
NA,The bill will also increase the veterans,122
NA,disability pension for special rate and inter-,122
NA,mediate rate recipients by $50 and $25 a,122
NA,fortnight respectively from 3 July 2007. This,122
NA,"will benefit around 29,600 veterans who re-",122
NA,ceive either the special rate or the intermedi-,122
NA,ate rate of disability pension because their,122
NA,injuries or diseases related to war or defence,122
NA,service on behalf of Australia limit their,122
NA,"earning capacity. Once again, we welcome",122
NA,this catch-up payment. It was needed to ad-,122
NA,"dress the erosion of these pensions that, un-",122
NA,"der the Howard government, has occurred",122
NA,since 1997. It is unfortunate that the gov-,122
NA,ernment has not taken this opportunity to fix,122
NA,the indexation of these pensions.,122
NA,By contrast-and this is a very important,122
NA,contrast between the Howard government,122
NA,and the Labor opposition-Labor has already,122
NA,committed to properly indexing these pen-,122
NA,sions in the same way that the age pension is,122
NA,indexed. I call on the government to follow,122
NA,Labor's lead to make sure that these people,122
NA,do not fall behind in the way they have over,122
NA,the last few years. It is unfortunate that the,122
NA,government did not include extreme dis-,122
NA,ablement adjustment pension recipients in,122
NA,this catch-up budget. As I am sure everybody,122
NA,"in this House knows, these veterans fought in",123
NA,"World War II, Korea and Malaya and suffer",123
NA,"from severe disabilities. Unfortunately, it",123
NA,seems that once again they have been ig-,123
NA,nored by the government.,123
NA,War widows who claim a pension follow-,123
NA,ing the death of their spouse will now re-,123
NA,ceive an additional three months to claim a,123
NA,"backdated war widow's pension. Once again,",123
NA,we think this is a good move. From 1 July,123
NA,"2007, war widows who claim the pension",123
NA,within six months of their spouse's death will,123
NA,have their pension backdated to the time of,123
NA,"death, recognising that the death of a spouse",123
NA,in this situation is extremely difficult. This,123
NA,provision gives our war widows time to,123
NA,come to terms with all the things they need,123
NA,to do following a very painful and difficult,123
NA,event.,123
NA,Labor have been calling on the govern-,123
NA,ment to address the erosion of our most se-,123
NA,verely disabled war veterans pensions. I want,123
NA,to inform the House about the dimension of,123
NA,the loss that these pensioners have faced be-,123
NA,cause of the government's refusal to properly,123
NA,"index their pensions. Over the last 10 years,",123
NA,because these pensions are only linked to,123
NA,"increases in the cost of living, there has in",123
NA,fact been a drop of over $70 a fortnight in,123
NA,the value of the special rate disability pen-,123
NA,sion. That is a very substantial amount for,123
NA,"people dependent upon a pension. Similarly,",123
NA,there has been an erosion in the value of the,123
NA,extreme disablement adjustment and inter-,123
NA,"mediate pensions. Once again, I say to the",123
NA,"government that, although we do support",123
NA,"what is in this bill, it really is",123
NA,the long-term problem of indexation of these,123
NA,pensions is addressed. It is only by address-,123
NA,ing the long-term problem and making sure,123
NA,we have proper indexation that veterans will,123
NA,be given the certainty that the value of their,123
NA,payments will be maintained and the dignity,123
NA,of their circumstances will be respected.,123
NA,"As I said, I am very pleased we have indi-",123
NA,"cated that, if we are successful at the next",123
NA,"election, a Rudd Labor government will",123
NA,make sure that our most severely disabled,123
NA,war veterans will have their pensions ad-,123
NA,justed to take account of not just the cost of,123
NA,living but also the standard of living. A La-,123
NA,bor government will make sure that these,123
NA,veterans will no longer have to depend on,123
NA,the government delivering the sorts of ad,123
NA,"hoc, catch-up payments that we are debating",123
NA,today. If Labor is successful at the next elec-,123
NA,"tion, future increases that account for both",123
NA,increases in the cost of living and the stan-,123
NA,dard of living will be automatic under Labor.,123
NA,Indexation is the only long-term solution to,123
NA,maintain the true value of veterans pensions.,123
NA,"In 1997, when the Howard government",123
NA,"indexed a range of other pensions, they left",123
NA,out the above general rate disability pen-,123
NA,sions. Since that time there has been an ero-,123
NA,sion of the value of these pensions compared,123
NA,to pensions in the broader community-for,123
NA,"example, in 1997 the special rate disability",123
NA,pension represented 46.3 per cent of male,123
NA,total average weekly earnings. On the most,123
NA,"recent figures available, it now represents",123
NA,only 42.9 per cent. The government provided,123
NA,"only partial indexation in 2004, and that was",123
NA,in response to sustained protest from the vet-,123
NA,"eran community. Unfortunately, it was only a",123
NA,"bandaid solution, and tonight we are debat-",123
NA,ing another catch-up rather than a long-term,123
NA,solution. We certainly do not want to treat,123
NA,our most severely disabled war veterans in,123
NA,this way. Labor wants to give war veterans,123
NA,high time that security for the future.,123
NA,To be very specific about what we intend,123
NA,to do: if we are successful at the next elec-,123
NA,"tion, Labor will restore the value of the spe-",123
NA,"cial rate disability pension, the intermediate",123
NA,rate and the extreme disablement adjustment,123
NA,pensions by indexing the whole of these pen-,123
NA,sions to movements in male total average,123
NA,"weekly earnings or the consumer price index,",123
NA,whichever is greater. This will benefit more,124
NA,"than 43,000 war veterans with disabilities.",124
NA,"On current projections, over the first four",124
NA,"years after implementation, the recipients of",124
NA,"these pensions will be $1,700 better off, with",124
NA,their pensions building to $30 a fortnight,124
NA,more than they would otherwise have been.,124
NA,The announcement certainly concerns the,124
NA,most severely disabled of our war veterans.,124
NA,They include those who fought and served in,124
NA,"conflicts including World War II, Korea, Ma-",124
NA,"laya, Vietnam, the Gulf War, East Timor, Iraq",124
NA,"and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, we are al-",124
NA,ready seeing veterans from Iraq and Af-,124
NA,ghanistan needing assistance. As of Decem-,124
NA,"ber 2006, eight soldiers who served in Af-",124
NA,ghanistan and two from Iraq would be af-,124
NA,fected by Labor's commitment. I certainly,124
NA,hope we are able to deliver that increase as a,124
NA,result of being successful at the next elec-,124
NA,tion.,124
NA,"As I am sure everybody here knows, our",124
NA,veterans have paid a very high price for their,124
NA,"service to our country, and this really is",124
NA,"about fixing an injustice. Once again, I want",124
NA,to give credit to our shadow minister. A lot,124
NA,people at my recent Anzac Day service at the,124
NA,repatriation hospital in Melbourne said to me,124
NA,how grateful they were for the way in which,124
NA,the member for Bruce has been willing to,124
NA,listen and to convince our colleagues about,124
NA,the importance of this measure. I know how,124
NA,much it is appreciated by veterans. I think,124
NA,that would apply not just to people in my,124
NA,electorate but to people right around Austra-,124
NA,lia.,124
NA,I just want to say in summary that we,124
NA,support these payments. We think that they,124
NA,are very important and we want them to get,124
NA,"into the hands of the carers, seniors and vet-",124
NA,"erans as quickly as possible. However, it is",124
NA,"unfortunate, given that the bill has been",124
NA,"brought in so quickly, that the financial im-",124
NA,pact statement contained in the explanatory,124
NA,memorandum does not give any indication of,124
NA,departmental costs associated with the pay-,124
NA,ments. I would just say to the minister that,124
NA,when he is summing up this debate-we ob-,124
NA,viously do not want to hold up the legisla-,124
NA,tion; we think it is very important-these,124
NA,matters nevertheless need to be dealt with,124
NA,"properly, because the parliament needs to",124
NA,"know about these costs. In this bill, there are",124
NA,also very wide powers given to the minister,124
NA,to make administrative arrangements for,124
NA,these payments by legislative instruments.,124
NA,"Once again, I think these issues need to be",124
NA,properly explained when the legislation,124
NA,comes into the parliament. I will finish by,124
NA,reiterating Labor's strong support for these,124
NA,"payments. We know that, for many seniors,",124
NA,"carers and veterans, life is pretty tough. It is",124
NA,"hard for them to make ends meet, and I know",124
NA,any support will be very gratefully received.,124
Mr FAWCETT ,Wakefield) (4.53 pm)-I,124
NA,rise to address the Social Security and Veter-,124

NA,ticularly those who own their own homes in,124
NA,areas that do not have high council rates and,124
NA,where they have access to public transport et,124
NA,"cetera, but there are some-perhaps those in",124
NA,Housing Trust homes who do not have ac-,124
NA,cess to public transport or those with very,124
NA,"high council rates-who, for the same given",124
NA,"income, really struggle to put food on the",124
NA,"table. I think it is important that at this time,",124
NA,"with the budget, we look at any measures we",124
NA,can to make sure that we have the fairest and,124
NA,most equitable distribution of some of the,125
NA,wealth that this nation is enjoying to those,125
NA,who have gone before us and helped to build,125
NA,this nation.,125
NA,The older Australians bonus of $500 is,125
NA,payable to every person over pension age,125
NA,who is eligible for the utilities allowance or,125
NA,the seniors concession allowance on budget,125
NA,night this week. For DVA pensioners this,125
NA,"also includes age, invalidity or partner ser-",125
NA,"vice pensioners over pension age, and Com-",125
NA,monwealth seniors health card holders and,125
NA,gold card holders over pension age. These,125
NA,are one-off payments but they are non-,125
NA,taxable and they are not classed as income.,125
NA,"Those are important things, because some of",125
NA,the feedback I have had from people is that,125
NA,they have appreciated rises in pensions be-,125
NA,fore but particularly those in Housing Trust,125
NA,properties have noted that some of that-in,125
NA,"fact, a substantial amount-gets taken away",125
NA,by the Housing Trust. So those people are,125
NA,not as well off as we would have intended by,125
NA,giving them a rise in their pensions. By tak-,125
NA,ing this approach of a bonus-as we look at,125
NA,things like the utilities allowance-we have,125
NA,ensured that it does not come into the equa-,125
NA,tion when things like house trust rents are,125
NA,calculated. So the people who are receiving,125
NA,this bonus are actually getting the opportu-,125
NA,nity to use the entire bonus for the purposes,125
NA,that they want to in their own households.,125
NA,"Whether that is to pay off bills, to assist",125
NA,"things around the home or to do other things,",125
NA,the entire amount is available to them.,125
NA,"In the electorate of Wakefield, there are",125
NA,"some 15,000 aged pensioners in receipt of",125
NA,the utilities allowance who will receive this,125
NA,"$500, and there are nearly 1,200 seniors in",125
NA,receipt of the senior concession allowance,125
NA,who will receive it as well. So well over,125
NA,"16,000 seniors in Wakefield will receive this",125
NA,"$500, which is one way that this government,",125
NA,through its responsible economic manage-,125
NA,"ment, can share the wealth that this country",125
NA,is currently generating.,125
NA,The other people whom I interact with on,125
NA,a regular basis are in groups such as the,125
NA,Elizabeth Special School-the parents there,125
NA,who care for children with special needs-,125
NA,"and the Northern Carers Network, including",125
NA,"Maria Ross, who runs that organisation.",125
NA,They are people who care for the elderly and,125
NA,those with disabilities or chronic illnesses.,125
NA,They invest a huge amount in some of the,125
NA,"most frail and needy in our community, and",125
NA,we cannot begin to thank them enough for,125
NA,"that. The carer bonuses, which have been",125
NA,"paid now for the fourth year in a row, are just",125
NA,a small way in which the government recog-,125
NA,nises the invaluable work that these people,125
NA,do.,125
NA,"As in previous years, this year the gov-",125
NA,ernment will provide a lump sum payment to,125
NA,eligible carers who were in receipt of the,125
NA,carer payment or the carer service pension,125
NA,and/or the carer allowance and those in re-,125
NA,ceipt of the wife pension or the DVA partner,125
NA,service pension who also receive carer al-,125
NA,lowance on budget night this year. In Wake-,125
NA,"field's case, nearly 4,400 people are in re-",125
NA,ceipt of carers allowance. They will receive,125
NA,"that $600 bonus. Over 1,000 people who are",125
NA,in receipt of the carer payment will also re-,125
NA,"ceive it. So nearly 5,500 people who are car-",125
NA,"ers-who are giving of their time, energy",125
NA,with and compassion to care for those around,125
NA,them-are recognised in a small but signifi-,125
NA,"cant way through this measure, which I wel-",125
NA,come.,125
NA,I also welcome the opposition's support,125
NA,for these measures. It is encouraging to see,125
NA,"that they also see the benefit of it, but I am",125
NA,somewhat bemused by their comments about,125
NA,the measures that we have taken to support,125
NA,veterans. As someone who served for over,125
NA,22 years in the armed forces I am very aware,125
NA,of the needs of veterans. Certainly one of the,125
NA,large issues that have been brought to my,126
NA,attention time and again by the TPI organisa-,126
NA,tion is the matter of the indexation of the,126
NA,income or compensation aspects. This gov-,126
NA,ernment has chosen to increase the special,126
NA,rate by $50 a fortnight and the intermediate,126
NA,"rate by $25 a fortnight, with effect from July",126
NA,this year.,126
NA,I note that the opposition has welcomed,126
NA,"that, but, at the same time, they criticise it",126
NA,and say how good their plan is. But I notice,126
NA,"that their plan, announced by Mr Rudd, looks",126
NA,"at commencing indexation, which would",126
NA,build over a four-year period to a sum of $30,126
NA,per fortnight. The previous speaker was say-,126
NA,"ing just before that, under their plans veter-",126
NA,"ans would be better off by some $1,700. Un-",126
NA,"der our plan, because the $50 comes into",126
NA,effect from July this year and is not incre-,126
NA,"mentally built over four years, TPI pension-",126
NA,"ers will be better off by over $5,000. When",126
NA,"you compare those two schemes, it is fairly",126
NA,clear that we have taken a step that optimises,126
NA,the benefit to these veterans who have served,126
NA,"our country, with immediate effect from July",126
NA,this year. I certainly welcome that move. I,126
NA,also welcome the moves in terms of funeral,126
NA,"benefits, although personally I am disap-",126
NA,"pointed they were not greater, and I welcome",126
NA,the fact that war widows now have a longer,126
NA,period in which to register their claims for,126
NA,the new pension once their husband or wife,126
NA,dies from a war-related cause.,126
NA,The important thing that has come out of,126
NA,this is that this government is able to provide,126
NA,these support measures to people who have,126
NA,gone before us in our community because its,126
NA,good economic management has led to more,126
NA,revenue. Why is there more revenue? It is,126
NA,"because there are more people in work, be-",126
NA,cause business has been encouraged and be-,126
NA,cause there has been investment in this coun-,126
NA,"try. We have seen revenue go up, which has",126
NA,given the government more options to pro-,126
NA,"vide for carers, for our seniors, for education,",126
NA,"for the environment, for infrastructure and",126
NA,for defence. Because of good economic,126
NA,"management, we are able to do the important",126
NA,things that a government should do.,126
NA,I am glad to see that the opposition have,126
NA,"supported these measures. I am disappointed,",126
NA,"however, that over the last 10 years they",126
NA,have not supported the measures that have,126
NA,led to this economic outcome. When we,126
NA,"came to office in 1996, there was $96 billion",126
NA,"of debt, resulting in $8½ billion of interest",126
NA,having to be paid every year. There were,126
NA,"deficits year after year, which meant there",126
NA,was no capacity to provide this sort of sup-,126
NA,port to a range of people with a range of,126
NA,"needs in our community. So, whilst I am glad",126
NA,"they support these measures, I am disap-",126
NA,pointed they have not supported the eco-,126
NA,nomic measures over the years that have led,126
NA,to us having the economic capacity to share,126
NA,the wealth of this nation not only across port-,126
NA,"folio areas but, importantly, with our seniors,",126
NA,"our carers and our veterans, to whom we owe",126
NA,an enormous debt of gratitude.,126
Mr GRIFFIN ,Bruce) (5.02 pm)-I,126
NA,would like to welcome the Social Security,126
NA,and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amend-,126
NA,ment (One-off Payments and Other 2007,126
NA,Budget Measures) Bill 2007 and to make,126
NA,"some brief points today, particularly relating",126
NA,to the veterans and ex-services community. I,126
NA,will focus on two or three points and I will,126
NA,pick up on a couple of points that my friend,126
NA,the member for Wakefield made on the way,126
NA,"through-they were not bad points, but I",126
NA,want to further clarify our position with re-,126
NA,spect to indexation.,126
NA,I will start off with the compensation,126
NA,payments under schedule 5 for certain World,126
NA,"War II internments. Under this schedule, the",126
NA,"bill will make one-off payments of $25,000",126
NA,to former Australian prisoners of war in,126
NA,Europe or to their surviving widows as at 1,126
NA,January 2007. Labor welcomes this ex gratia,126
NA,payment. This is a long overdue initiative,127
NA,that addresses an injustice that left these,127
NA,prisoners out of two previous ex gratia pay-,127
NA,ments.,127
NA,In 2001 the Howard government made a,127
NA,"payment of $25,000 to former Australian",127
NA,prisoners of war in Japan. At this stage there,127
NA,was much criticism that they had left out the,127
NA,POWs of Europe and Korea. The govern-,127
NA,ment ignored the criticism at this time. In,127
NA,"2004, after the Clarke review, they finally",127
NA,made a payment to former Australian prison-,127
NA,ers of war in Korea. Again they were criti-,127
NA,cised for leaving out Australian prisoners of,127
NA,"war in Europe. Finally, six years and two",127
NA,"elections after the original announcement,",127
NA,these former prisoners or their surviving,127
NA,widows are getting what is duly owed to,127
NA,them.,127
NA,"Until now, the government argued that the",127
NA,conditions experienced by the POWs in,127
NA,Europe did not warrant this payment. How-,127
NA,"ever, one thing should be made very clear,",127
NA,and that is that prisoners of war interned in,127
NA,"Europe did suffer, and they suffered consid-",127
NA,erably. Returned POWs reported a lack of,127
NA,appropriate medical care and facilities; an,127
NA,inadequate diet; inappropriate washing facili-,127
NA,ties; sleeping quarters infested with lice and,127
NA,vermin; confinement in small spaces without,127
NA,"toilet facilities, food and water whilst being",127
NA,transported; physical abuse from their cap-,127
NA,tors; forced marches; slave labour; being,127
NA,shot or abused when caught trying to escape;,127
NA,"and being shackled. In addition, POWs were",127
NA,subjected to the extreme cold of European,127
NA,winters while lacking rations. The Ex-,127
NA,Prisoners of War Association of Australia has,127
NA,argued that breaches of the Geneva conven-,127
NA,"tion varied between regions, while other",127
NA,"breaches relating to security, rations, medical",127
NA,"matters, transport and shackling were more",127
NA,systematic and clearly the policy of the Ger-,127
NA,man high command. Labor congratulates the,127
NA,government on finally correcting this injus-,127
NA,tice and fully supports this worthwhile initia-,127
NA,tive. I would like to particularly congratulate,127
NA,the minister because I know that he has been,127
NA,interested in this issue since he became the,127
NA,minister. I give him credit for being able to,127
NA,steer this action through at this budget.,127
NA,I will talk briefly about some other mat-,127
NA,ters. Under schedule 6 there are amendments,127
NA,to increase funeral benefits. The bill will in-,127
NA,crease the maximum funeral benefit for eli-,127
NA,gible veterans under the Veterans' Entitle-,127
NA,"ments Act 1986 from $1,000 to $2,000.",127
NA,"Again, Labor congratulates the government",127
NA,on this initiative. There has been a longstand-,127
NA,ing concern within the veterans community,127
NA,about the low level of this benefit in com-,127
NA,parison to the benefit allowed under the Mili-,127
NA,tary Rehabilitation and Compensation Act,127
NA,2004. This goes some way to addressing this,127
NA,discrepancy and is a positive step in the right,127
NA,direction. It certainly is an issue that is raised,127
NA,with me regularly within the veterans com-,127
NA,munity as something that they see as being,127
NA,quite inequitable. I know that many in the,127
NA,veterans community will not feel this has,127
NA,gone far enough. I understand their position,127
NA,"on that. It is something that we will look at,",127
NA,but at this stage I congratulate the govern-,127
NA,ment on taking action with this initiative.,127
NA,The next item I would like to discuss is,127
NA,the amendments under schedule 7 to increase,127
NA,the rates of certain pensions. Under this,127
NA,schedule the bill will increase the veterans,127
NA,disability pension for special rate and inter-,127
NA,mediate rate recipients by $50 and $25 re-,127
NA,spectively per fortnight from 3 July 2007.,127
NA,"This measure will benefit around 29,600 vet-",127
NA,erans who receive either the special rate or,127
NA,the intermediate rate of disability pension,127
NA,"because their injuries or diseases, related to",127
NA,war or defence service on behalf of Austra-,127
NA,"lia, limit their earning capacity. This was a",127
NA,matter which the member for Wakefield,127
NA,spoke about earlier. He sought to contrast his,127
NA,understanding of our position on this issue,127
NA,with the government's and to focus on cer-,128
NA,tain aspects of that. I will go to that matter,128
NA,briefly. I make it very clear at this stage,128
NA,we completely support the payments that are,128
NA,being made through this process.,128
NA,I want to make my argument on this issue,128
NA,clear: there has been a significant erosion as,128
NA,a result of incomplete indexation for those,128
NA,veterans under the special rate disability,128
NA,"sion, the intermediate rate pension and the",128
NA,extremely disabled adjustment pension over,128
NA,the last 11 years. It dates back to when the,128
NA,government itself created a situation where,128
NA,we had male total average weekly earnings,128
NA,"or CPI, whichever is the greater, for the age",128
NA,pension and a number of other pensions but,128
NA,it left these pensions on CPI increases. There,128
NA,is an argument for it. It is an argument which,128
NA,"was not accepted by the veterans community,",128
NA,and it is an argument which has been debated,128
NA,"with a good deal of heat, passion and anger",128
NA,within the veterans community over the last,128
NA,decade. It was reconsidered as part of the,128
NA,"Clarke review, and the government made",128
NA,some changes with respect to splitting the,128
NA,payment in two. But I think it is fair to say,128
NA,"that, although that addressed part of the is-",128
NA,"sue, it actually created a good deal more",128
NA,concern and in fact incensed elements of the,128
NA,veterans community on the basis that it was,128
NA,"not seen to be fair, reasonable or just in the",128
NA,circumstances.,128
NA,What we have seen under that erosion,128
NA,over the last 10-plus years now is-,128
NA,depending on whom you talk to-an impact,128
NA,of somewhere between $70 and $92-plus a,128
NA,fortnight for someone on the special rate dis-,128
NA,ability pension. So it is significant; there is,128
NA,absolutely no doubt about that. Over that,128
NA,"period, we have seen no catch-up payment,",128
NA,"none at all, to address the issue of that ero-",128
NA,sion. There was one catch-up payment-if,128
NA,you could call it that-one adjustment. That,128
NA,related to the implementation of the GST.,128
NA,"Essentially, as many lower income earners",128
NA,were receiving some additional compensa-,128
NA,"tion to make up for the costs of the GST,",128
NA,"that there was a small increase. But, in the con-",128
NA,"text of the erosion of the value, this is the",128
NA,first time. We are talking 12 budgets to actu-,128
NA,ally see some action. To put that into per-,128
NA,"spective, $50 in one hit sounds great-it",128
NA,sounds fantastic; it sounds significant-but it,128
NA,"pen- is just over $4, $4.17 or thereabouts, per",128
NA,budget if you add it up over time. When you,128
NA,"put it in that perspective, it is significant but",128
NA,there is still a long way to go.,128
NA,The position that I have taken on this is-,128
NA,"sue, and it was announced recently, related to",128
NA,"indexation, which we sought to put forward",128
NA,"as policy-in fact, the member for Wakefield",128
NA,mentioned it-because that has been the,128
NA,principal demand from right across the ex-,128
NA,service organisations and the veterans com-,128
NA,munity. Indexation is required to ensure that,128
NA,"there is certainty, dignity and justice in the",128
NA,payments that they receive and to halt the,128
NA,erosion.,128
NA,"On from that, there has been the issue of",128
NA,that erosion and the impact of dealing with,128
NA,that erosion-the question of a catch-up,128
NA,payment. The position that I have put with,128
NA,respect to that issue is very clearly this: La-,128
NA,bor stood ready to accept and to support any,128
NA,payment that the government came forward,128
NA,with which actually dealt with the issue of,128
NA,"that catch-up, because we knew and we be-",128
NA,"lieve that, as that erosion occurred under this",128
NA,"government, this government has the respon-",128
NA,sibility to deal with it and to bring forward a,128
NA,measure to compensate those who have,128
NA,missed out as a result of that erosion.,128
NA,The member for Wakefield made a point,128
NA,about the value of our proposal-probably,128
NA,best estimated over a period of four years,128
NA,from introduction-being something like,128
NA,"$1,700 net and $30 per fortnight at the end of",128
NA,that four-year period and that that is there-,128
NA,fore significantly less than what the govern-,128
NA,"ment proposes with $50 a fortnight now,",129
NA,which will add up to something like five,129
NA,grand. The point is this: that is something,129
NA,that the government needed to do because of,129
NA,its neglect over the last decade. Labor sup-,129
NA,port that payment going forward. Ours is,129
NA,additional to that and ours remains additional,129
NA,"to that, so let us be in no doubt about the",129
NA,cumstances here. The government has done,129
NA,"what the government had to do, because the",129
NA,government had let the whole system go to,129
NA,seed. We have said that we will endorse that,129
NA,payment and will then further increase it by,129
NA,introducing indexation. It has taken 12 budg-,129
NA,ets for a catch-up payment. When will the,129
NA,next one be-in another 12 budgets? How,129
NA,much greater will the difference be over that,129
NA,period of time?,129
NA,The fact of the matter is that these people,129
NA,"need certainty, they deserve certainty, and we",129
NA,will give them certainty after the next elec-,129
NA,tion by ensuring that there is no further ero-,129
NA,sion. We will restore indexation so it is there,129
NA,for all these people who have been affected.,129
NA,That is the important thing about our policy,129
NA,and it is the difference between us and the,129
NA,government on this issue. We fully support,129
NA,this as part recompense for what went,129
NA,"wrong, but we want to try to set up a system",129
NA,into the future that means we will not be,129
NA,"coming back here in five, 10 or 12 years time",129
NA,"once again saying, ‘Here's a payment to",129
NA,make up for what you've lost over the last,129
NA,decade.' I think that is a very important,129
NA,point.,129
NA,"I have to say, though, that that is not the",129
NA,way the minister saw it. When the details of,129
NA,"our announcement came out, Minister Bill-",129
NA,son was quoted in the Herald Sun in an arti-,129
NA,cle by Neil Wilson entitled ‘Labor's plan,129
NA,wins veterans'. The article reads in part:,129
NA,But Veterans Affairs Minister Bruce Billson,129
NA,slammed the measure as a “cobbled together me-,129
NA,dia stunt”.,129
NA,Mr Billson said it would take until 2012 for,129
NA,disabled veterans to achieve any real benefit.,129
NA,He then went on to say:,129
NA,They say this is about equity but it is illogical.,129
NA,It is inconsistent and unprincipled in ignoring,129
NA,"100,000 other people on lesser degrees of disabil-",129
NA,ity pension ...,129
NA,cirI will just pick up on a couple of points. In,129
NA,terms of it being a ‘cobbled together media,129
NA,"stunt', we can always debate the issue of",129
NA,when these things are announced. Let me,129
NA,"make it very clear that I, and Labor, have",129
NA,been working on this policy for quite some,129
NA,time. I have been talking about this issue in,129
NA,speeches at veterans congresses all over this,129
NA,country for more than 12 months. I have,129
NA,been saying that this is an issue that is under,129
NA,serious consideration. Senior people within,129
NA,ex-service organisations in this country can,129
NA,confirm that. They know because I and oth-,129
NA,ers have been talking to them.,129
NA,I am joined today by the member for,129
NA,Cowan. I know he has an in-depth under-,129
NA,standing of this issue and his knowledge has,129
NA,been of great assistance to me in trying to,129
NA,come to grips with what is in many ways a,129
NA,very complex issue. This is not something,129
NA,that has just occurred overnight. A lot of,129
NA,"work has gone into it, and therefore I do not",129
NA,think it can be considered to be a ‘cobbled,129
NA,together media stunt'. The minister also said,129
NA,that it would take until 2012 for disabled,129
NA,"veterans to achieve any real benefit. Again,",129
NA,"that is just not true. Under our proposal, the",129
NA,first indexation point after our first budget,129
NA,will be September 2008. The difference be-,129
NA,tween MTAWE and CPI will be paid at that,129
NA,time.,129
NA,The point in relation to the $30 is that that,129
NA,is what we estimate the likely cap to be over,129
NA,"the four-year period of the forward estimates,",129
NA,but people will be getting money as they be-,129
NA,"come entitled to it, under the CPI versus",129
NA,"MTAWE adjustment, every six months. So,",130
NA,"in fact, the minister is wrong.",130
NA,"On the issue of equity, the minister is say-",130
NA,ing it is illogical and inconsistent. He men-,130
NA,"tioned the issue of the 100,000 other people",130
NA,on lesser degrees of disability pension. What,130
NA,he is talking about is people on varying rates,130
NA,of disability as a result of general rate dis-,130
NA,"ability pensions. Again, this is a complex",130
NA,area and I will not take the time of the House,130
NA,to go through it in detail. But I will say a,130
NA,"couple of things. Firstly, in respect of general",130
NA,rate disability pension I do not wish to deni-,130
NA,grate in any way the disabilities that many,130
NA,"people have, but the key issue normally in",130
NA,the consideration between general rate dis-,130
NA,ability pension and special rates and inter-,130
NA,mediate rates is the recipient's capacity to,130
NA,"work. Secondly, the minister's own press",130
NA,release with respect to the catch-up payment,130
NA,is interesting. I will go to what he said to,130
NA,justify why special rate and intermediate rate,130
NA,pensioners got this catch-up payment but,130
NA,nobody else did. He said:,130
NA,The special rate takes into account incapacity,130
NA,from war or defence caused disabilities that,130
NA,are so great that a veteran cannot undertake any,130
NA,employment totalling more than eight hours per,130
NA,week. The intermediate rate takes into account,130
NA,incapacity from war or defence caused disabilities,130
NA,that alone are so great that a veteran cannot un-,130
NA,dertake any employment other than on a part-time,130
NA,or intermittent basis.,130
NA,"That is exactly the case. The point is that, in",130
NA,"the paper, the minister accuses Labor of be-",130
NA,ing illogical and inconsistent with respect to,130
NA,"this particular difference, yet he himself has",130
NA,used this definition as a basis for citing why,130
NA,certain groups have got this payment and,130
NA,certain groups have not. I think the minister,130
NA,"was right in the budget press release, but I",130
NA,think he was wrong in the newspaper article.,130
NA,"In those circumstances, he ought to have an-",130
NA,other hard look at his position on this issue.,130
NA,This is an issue of real and ongoing concern,130
NA,within the veteran community and it is not,130
NA,going to go away. The reason it is not going,130
NA,"to go away is that, once again, whether it be",130
NA,"July 2007, July 2008, July 2009 or July",130
NA,"2010, the fact is that the erosion will con-",130
NA,tinue. Six months after the $50 is paid the,130
NA,erosion will continue-and it will keep go-,130
NA,"ing. People will be left to come back, cap in",130
NA,"hand, just before the election after next, to",130
NA,"seek some recompense, some catch up, in a",130
NA,"situation which is not fair, not justified, not",130
NA,dignified and not something that these peo-,130
NA,ple deserve to be put through.,130
NA,I want to pick up on another couple of is-,130
NA,sues under the bill. Under schedule 8 there,130
NA,are amendments relating to the backdating of,130
NA,war widow and widower payments. Under,130
NA,this schedule the bill will allow war widows,130
NA,who claim a war widows pension following,130
NA,the death of their spouse an additional three,130
NA,months to claim a backdated pension. From,130
NA,"1 July 2007, war widows who claim the pen-",130
NA,sion within six months of their spouse's,130
NA,death will have their pension backdated to,130
NA,the time of death. Labor supports this meas-,130
NA,alone ure. This is a worthwhile reform that has,130
NA,been requested and pushed hard by organisa-,130
NA,tions such as Legacy and the War Widows,130
NA,Guild. This reform owes a lot to their hard,130
NA,work. I congratulate them and I also con-,130
NA,gratulate the government on taking this ac-,130
NA,tion.,130
NA,The sacrifice by our nation's war widows,130
NA,cannot be underestimated. They have had to,130
NA,suffer the consequences of our nation's wars,130
NA,much more acutely than the rest of the popu-,130
NA,lation and they deserve everything they can,130
NA,get. The only thing that concerns me about,130
NA,"this reform is the number of widows who,",130
NA,"prior to this reform, would have been finan-",130
NA,cially disadvantaged by not submitting their,130
NA,application within three months. The esti-,130
NA,mated cost of this measure suggests that,130
NA,there are a high number of widows who,130
NA,could be classified within this category. But,130
NA,this is a worthwhile and positive reform and,131
NA,it has the full support of Labor.,131
NA,"Under schedules 1 and 2 of the bill, which",131
NA,provide for one-off payments to older Aus-,131
NA,"tralians, each person who qualified",131
NA,ties allowance or seniors concession allow-,131
NA,"ance on budget night will receive a one-off,",131
NA,non-taxable bonus payment of $500. In ef-,131
NA,"fect, this will provide $500 before the end",131
NA,the financial year to all age pensioners and,131
NA,self-funded retirees earning less than,131
NA,"$50,000 for singles or $80,000 for couples",131
NA,combined. This measure is expected to affect,131
NA,"approximately 286,000 veterans and war",131
NA,widows. Our nation owes a lot to our veter-,131
NA,ans and war widows and Labor fully sup-,131
NA,ports this payment being made. To be eligi-,131
NA,ble for this payment a veteran or war widow,131
NA,will need to have been of age pension age or,131
NA,service pension age on budget night and be,131
NA,in receipt of an income support payment that,131
NA,qualifies them for utilities allowance or hold,131
NA,a Commonwealth seniors health card or De-,131
NA,partment of Veterans' Affairs gold card,131
NA,which qualifies them for seniors concession,131
NA,allowance. Labor fully supports this meas-,131
NA,ure. It is hoped that this payment will help,131
NA,ease the burden that cost of living increases,131
NA,are having on our veterans and war widows.,131
NA,"Under schedules 3 and 4 of the bill, which",131
NA,"provide for one-off payments to carers, a",131
NA,"payment of $1,000 will be made to carers",131
NA,who receive carer payment. Recipients of,131
NA,carer allowance will receive a payment of,131
NA,$600 for each eligible care receiver. In,131
NA,"tion to the $600 carer allowance bonus, re-",131
NA,cipients of carer allowance who also receive,131
NA,wife pension or the Department of Veteran's,131
NA,Affairs partner service pension will receive,131
NA,"payment of $1,000. The last three budgets",131
NA,have provided similar one-off lump-sum bo-,131
NA,nuses to eligible carers.,131
NA,The health of many veterans is often,131
NA,"maintained, to a substantial degree, by their",131
NA,partners in their role as carers. There are 2.5,131
NA,million carers in Australia who look after,131
NA,family members or friends who have a dis-,131
NA,"ability, a mental illness, a chronic condition",131
NA,for utilior are frail aged.,131
NA,Carers make a great contribution to our,131
NA,society and to the economy more broadly by,131
NA,"caring for their loved ones, who may other-",131
NA,of wise be taken out of the community. It is,131
NA,estimated that carers save the Australian,131
NA,economy approximately $20 billion annually.,131
NA,They do this by providing unpaid work. Car-,131
NA,ers clearly contribute a great deal to the,131
NA,wellbeing of our veterans and to those in the,131
NA,broader community who may require assis-,131
NA,tance in their daily lives. For these carers this,131
NA,measure will be very welcome and it is fully,131
NA,"supported by federal Labor. However, I",131
NA,"should add that, over the last couple of years,",131
NA,the system for payment of this allowance has,131
NA,not always run perfectly. I urge the depart-,131
NA,ments involved to ensure that all carers who,131
NA,are eligible to receive this payment receive it,131
NA,on time. Our carers should not have to go,131
NA,chasing the government for this payment.,131
NA,"By and large, Labor supports this legisla-",131
NA,"tion, and I wish it a speedy passage to the",131
NA,other place.,131
Mr EDWARDS ,Cowan) (5.21 pm)-I,131
NA,also support the Social Security and Veter-,131
NA,ans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (One-,131
NA,off Payments and Other 2007 Budget Meas-,131
NA,ures) Bill 2007. While I will not speak for,131
NA,"too long, so as not to delay it, I want to make",131
NA,"addisome points. Firstly, I want to compliment",131
NA,"the member for Bruce, Alan Griffin, who",131
NA,came in after the last election as the shadow,131
NA,minister for veterans' affairs. He has moved,131
NA,"a around Australia in a very energetic way,",131
NA,consulting with the veterans community. He,131
NA,has been to groups that I have not even heard,131
NA,"of, and I have been heavily involved with the",131
NA,veterans community for some time. Right,131
NA,across the length and breadth of Australia he,131
NA,has listened and spoken to them as he has,132
NA,consulted with them. I think our policy on,132
NA,indexation which was announced the other,132
NA,day-it is just one policy and there will be,132
NA,others before the election-is a very good,132
NA,"policy, being well reasoned and well consid-",132
NA,ered as a response to concerns put to us by,132
NA,the veterans community. I compliment Alan,132
NA,"and the Leader of the Australian Labor Party,",132
NA,"Kevin Rudd, on their response to this issue,",132
NA,an issue which has been going on for a long,132
NA,time.,132
NA,"I do not want to criticise the government,",132
NA,but I do want to make one little point. I think,132
NA,Alan Griffin's response to this budget has,132
NA,been very gracious. He has been very posi-,132
NA,tive and very objective. I did look for a little,132
NA,bit more from the Minister for Veterans' Af-,132
NA,fairs when our policy was announced. I,132
NA,thought the minister's response was very,132
NA,juvenile. He knows that this issue of indexa-,132
NA,tion has been an issue of contention in the,132
NA,veterans community for a long time. That we,132
NA,"moved to address it was a good initiative,",132
NA,and I think the minister could have and,132
NA,should have recognised this. The minister,132
NA,"has come to the portfolio at a fortuitous time,",132
NA,at a time leading up to an election when the,132
NA,government is flush with money. The gov-,132
NA,ernment know they have got a difficult elec-,132
NA,tion in front of them and they are prepared to,132
NA,spend money. So I wish that the minister's,132
NA,response could have been a little more ma-,132
NA,ture and a little more gracious. I will always,132
NA,speak critically of the minister when I think,132
NA,"there is a need to, but, like this morning, I",132
NA,will also compliment him when there is a,132
NA,need to.,132
NA,I have had a number of emails following,132
NA,the budget and the announcement of our pol-,132
NA,icy just a few days ago. I want to thank the,132
NA,Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia for,132
NA,the tremendous work that they have done,132
NA,over a long period of time. This particular,132
NA,ex-service organisation is not always in fa-,132
NA,vour with government or opposition. It puts,132
NA,first and foremost the welfare of its members,132
NA,"as its top priority, it is fearless in prosecuting",132
NA,the objects and aims of its membership and it,132
NA,is fearless in the way it goes about advocat-,132
NA,ing for and supporting its members. Some-,132
NA,"times it stands on individuals' toes, but it is a",132
NA,good ESO and I simply wish there were a,132
NA,few more ESOs and individuals out there in,132
NA,the veterans community who could take a,132
NA,leaf from its book.,132
NA,I want to thank the federation for the fact,132
NA,that it put out a press release today thanking,132
NA,both the government and the opposition for,132
NA,their responses to veterans issues. Its mem-,132
NA,"bers are not happy, and I understand why",132
NA,they are not happy. They are not happy with,132
NA,the fact that this payment of $50 falls some,132
NA,$42 short of what they have lost since 1997,132
NA,when indexation was taken away from the,132
NA,"pension, and they make that point. But, by",132
NA,"the same token, they congratulate the gov-",132
NA,ernment on making this payment. They also,132
NA,congratulate the Australian Labor Party on,132
NA,their policy of indexation. I think it is impor-,132
NA,tant for the veterans community when they,132
NA,"argue for something, even if they do not get",132
NA,"all that they want, to at least acknowledge it.",132
NA,They do not have to tug their forelock or,132
NA,"anything like that, but sometimes it helps to",132
NA,acknowledge that there has been at least,132
NA,"some movement, which I think encourages",132
NA,ministers and shadow ministers and other,132
NA,members of parliament to be more enthusias-,132
NA,tic in the way that they respond in addressing,132
NA,some of these issues. I want to congratulate,132
NA,Tim MCCombe and Graham Walker from the,132
NA,"Vietnam Veterans Federation. As I said, I",132
NA,think they do a great job.,132
NA,I have had a number of other emails. I am,132
NA,not going to refer to them all. I want to refer,132
NA,to one particular email because I think its,132
NA,writer makes some good points. It has come,132
NA,from a fellow by the name of Ron King. He,132
NA,has this to say:,132
NA,Well we have been thrown the keep quite,133
NA,crumbs again. What a disgrace to the Government,133
NA,of the day. We have been treated as the poor sec-,133
NA,onds compared to the other benefits given to other,133
NA,groups.,133
NA,He makes two particular points that are the,133
NA,"basis for these comments. Firstly, he says:",133
NA,We look at the funeral allowance of $2000.,133
NA,That buys the plot. Where is the rest of the costs,133
NA,coming from?,133
NA,This once again is discrimination compared to,133
NA,the MRCA funeral benefits. Surely a Veteran of,133
NA,any war is entitled to the dignity of leaving this,133
NA,world in a respected manner. The new grant for,133
NA,burial is not good enough.,133
NA,It is an improvement-we all acknowledge,133
NA,that. We appreciate it and we thank the gov-,133
NA,ernment for it. But the point he makes is a,133
NA,good one. Under the military compensation,133
NA,scheme the grant available for a funeral,133
NA,"benefit is some $4,890, just under $5,000.",133
NA,Given that the grant for a funeral under the,133
NA,military compensation scheme is just under,133
NA,"$5,000, why is a similar grant under the Vet-",133
NA,"erans' Entitlements Act only $2,000? That",133
NA,"does not make sense to me, and I would",133
NA,really like the minister or someone else in,133
NA,the government to tell me why this differen-,133
NA,tiation exists. Once again this will be a bone,133
NA,of contention. Mr King goes on to say this:,133
NA,The $50 hand out to the TPI is a small catch,133
NA,of the fallout from years of neglect.,133
NA,"To the Veteran community, once again they",133
NA,"have missed the point here, and that is the SR-",133
NA,special rate-,133
NA,pension needs to have a decent means of quarterly,133
NA,adjustment. Not just crumbs thrown at the will of,133
NA,a Government.,133
NA,"This point is well made, and I want to finish",133
NA,on this note. Not only have Labor addressed,133
NA,the issue of indexation; we have also sought,133
NA,to take the funding of veterans pensions out,133
NA,of the political arena. Our policy of indexa-,133
NA,tion means that it will happen on a regular,133
NA,basis and that it will not be subject to the,133
NA,"whim of the government of the day, nor to",133
NA,the whim of the minister of the day.,133
NA,For some 10 years the veteran community,133
NA,has suffered because of a political decision,133
NA,taken by the Howard government back in,133
NA,1997. The government have now repaid to,133
NA,the veterans who are on these entitlements,133
NA,about half of that which they have taken,133
NA,away from them over that period. But they,133
NA,"have made, in my view, a major mistake.",133
NA,They have left this issue fairly and squarely,133
NA,"in the political arena. Who is to say, should",133
NA,"this government be returned, that they will",133
NA,not do the same thing in the future to the vet-,133
NA,"eran community-that is, screw them finan-",133
NA,cially and not provide them with the regular,133
NA,indexation to which they are entitled to en-,133
NA,sure that their pensions retain the value that,133
NA,they should in the community? Who is to say,133
NA,that they simply will not screw the veteran,133
NA,community again and not allow any in-,133
NA,"creases for a period and then, when they face",133
NA,"a difficult election, when they know that they",133
NA,"are coming from behind, when they know",133
NA,"that they are on the nose, suddenly throw a",133
NA,"handful of money at them and say, ‘Look,",133
NA,"here's some money, we are looking after",133
NA,you; support us'? I hope that the veteran,133
NA,community see through this. I hope that the,133
NA,government might reconsider their policy,133
NA,up and the fact that they have short-changed,133
NA,every TPI veteran in this nation by some $42,133
NA,and that they might give some serious con-,133
NA,sideration to taking this issue out of the po-,133
NA,litical forum.,133
NA,I conclude by saying that I am very disap-,133
NA,"pointed that those on EDAs, who are some of",133
NA,the most disabled veterans in Australia and,133
NA,are some of the most disabled people in our,133
NA,"community, will not benefit from this budget",133
NA,at all. I think that is a shame. That decision,133
NA,will ensure that the EDA community contin-,133
NA,ues to suffer a lack of fairness. I commend,133
NA,the bill.,133
Mr WILKIE ,Swan) (5.31 pm)-I rise to,134
NA,speak on the Social Security and Veterans',134
NA,Affairs Legislation Amendment (One-off,134
NA,Payments and Other 2007 Budget Measures),134
NA,Bill 2007 and to add my comments to those,134
NA,"of the shadow minister, the member for",134
NA,"Bruce, and the shadow parliamentary secre-",134
NA,"tary, the member for Cowan. Before I com-",134
NA,"mence specific comments on this bill, I",134
NA,would like to say that the way veterans are,134
NA,treated by their country is a measure of the,134
NA,quality of a nation. Those men and women,134
NA,who served Australia in the forces deserve,134
NA,our highest praise and they deserve their,134
NA,rifices to be recognised and applauded by all,134
NA,of us. It upsets and disturbs me when I hear,134
NA,of veterans who are suffering difficulties in,134
NA,accessing the pensions and the support ser-,134
NA,vices which they are due. Every single one of,134
NA,us has a duty to ensure that the systems,134
NA,which administer the pensions and benefits,134
NA,which veterans receive are efficient in deliv-,134
NA,"ering those services. Sadly, this is not always",134
NA,the case.,134
NA,While I congratulate the Minister for,134
NA,"Families, Community Services and Indige-",134
NA,nous Affairs on the increase in pensions con-,134
NA,"tained in this bill, I would have dearly liked",134
NA,to have seen the government do much more,134
NA,for veterans. Every Anzac Day and Remem-,134
NA,brance Day we bow our heads to pray and,134
NA,"say, ‘Lest we forget.' As we honour those",134
NA,"who served, we should never forget the obli-",134
NA,gation we have to all of our returned service,134
NA,men and women to ensure that the programs,134
NA,in place for them and their families are well,134
NA,funded and efficiently delivered.,134
NA,"As I said earlier, a country can be judged",134
NA,by the way it treats its veterans. While suc-,134
NA,cessive Australian governments have recog-,134
NA,nised the obligation of all of us to veterans,134
NA,through the payment of pensions and bene-,134
NA,"fits, I am concerned that we have allowed the",134
NA,situation to drift and that now our veterans,134
NA,are under immense financial pressure. In my,134
NA,electorate there are a number of very active,134
NA,"RSL clubs, which I have the privilege of vis-",134
NA,iting on a regular basis. Most of these clubs,134
NA,have members who are TPIs and disabled,134
NA,veterans on pensions. I often hear dreadful,134
NA,accounts of the experiences of these veterans,134
NA,in making ends meet with the current levels,134
NA,of income that their pensions provide. There-,134
NA,"fore, I support the measures in this bill which",134
NA,provide additional income.,134
NA,"However, more is needed. That is why the",134
NA,Leader of the Opposition and the shadow,134
NA,"minister for veterans' affairs, the member for",134
NA,"sac- Bruce, have announced a major policy",134
NA,change to provide tangible improvements to,134
NA,the lives of our disabled veterans which,134
NA,would be in addition to the measures con-,134
NA,tained in this bill. Labor would increase,134
NA,benefits for our nation's most severely dis-,134
NA,abled war veterans by restoring the value of,134
NA,"the special rate disability pension, TPI and",134
NA,"TTI, intermediate rate and the extreme dis-",134
NA,ablement adjustment pensions by indexing,134
NA,all of these pensions to movements in male,134
NA,total average weekly earnings or the con-,134
NA,"sumer price index, whichever is the greater.",134
NA,This policy change will affect more than,134
NA,"43,000 war veterans with disabilities and is",134
NA,budgeted to cost $61 million. In the first four,134
NA,"years after implementation of this change,",134
NA,the recipients of these pensions will be,134
NA,"$1,700 better off, with their pensions build-",134
NA,ing to $30 a fortnight more than they would,134
NA,"otherwise have been, not including the",134
NA,changes that are announced in this bill. So,134
NA,they would be far better off even than that.,134
NA,Labor's proposal concerns the most se-,134
NA,verely disabled of our war veterans. They,134
NA,include those who fought and served in con-,134
NA,"flicts including World War II, Korea, Ma-",134
NA,"laya, Vietnam, the Gulf War, East Timor, Iraq",134
NA,and Afghanistan. We are already seeing vet-,134
NA,erans from Iraq and Afghanistan needing,134
NA,assistance. Already eight soldiers who served,134
NA,in Afghanistan and two from Iraq would be,134
NA,eligible under Labor's proposal for these,135
NA,"enhanced arrangements and, therefore,",135
NA,higher pensions.,135
NA,We have heard from many individuals and,135
NA,representatives of the veteran community,135
NA,"about the importance of this issue. In 1997,",135
NA,when the Howard government indexed a,135
NA,"range of other pensions, they left out the",135
NA,above general rate disability pensions. Since,135
NA,that time there has been an erosion of the,135
NA,value of these pensions compared to other,135
NA,"pensions. For example, in 1997 the special",135
NA,rate disability pension represented 46.3 per,135
NA,cent of male total average weekly earnings.,135
NA,"On the most recent figures available, it now",135
NA,represents only 42.9 per cent. If the Howard,135
NA,government had not squibbed the issue in,135
NA,"1997, these pensions would now be between",135
NA,$70 and $90 a fortnight higher. The Howard,135
NA,government provided only partial male total,135
NA,average weekly earnings indexation in 2004,135
NA,after sustained protests from the veteran,135
NA,community. We should never be in a position,135
NA,where our veterans have to scream out in,135
NA,order to be treated fairly. In a decent and fair,135
NA,"society with a reasonably good government,",135
NA,it should automatically happen that these,135
NA,"people get looked after. In fact, what was",135
NA,done in 2004 was merely a bandaid solution,135
NA,that failed to fully address the problem.,135
NA,I welcome the government's budget an-,135
NA,nouncement that it will increase the veterans,135
NA,special rate disability pensions by $25 and,135
NA,$50 respectively. But this is window dressing,135
NA,at best. It further demonstrates the govern-,135
NA,ment's reluctance to fully acknowledge the,135
NA,sacrifices of our veterans who have been,135
NA,incapacitated as a result of their service to,135
NA,our country. These men and women did not,135
NA,"ever fail us, but the government repays them",135
NA,"by sticking a new bandaid over the old one,",135
NA,hoping the old one will go away. Without the,135
NA,"indexation Labor has proposed, we will be",135
NA,revisiting this issue time and time again as,135
NA,veterans entitlements fail to keep up with the,135
NA,growth of other pensions. There has been no,135
NA,other issue that has been the subject of,135
NA,"greater, sustained and more passionate con-",135
NA,cern in the veterans community over the last,135
NA,10 years than this one.,135
NA,This is not just a concern that affects peo-,135
NA,ple in Western Australia-this issue affects,135
NA,"people right across Australia. In fact, I was",135
NA,just talking with the prior member for Brad-,135
NA,"don, Sid Sidebottom, before I came down",135
NA,here. A very high number of these people,135
NA,live in the area that he previously repre-,135
NA,"sented, and he is very passionate about the",135
NA,fact that this issue needs to be dealt with and,135
NA,commends Labor on its initiative of trying to,135
NA,index pensions into the future.,135
NA,Our disabled veterans have paid a very,135
NA,high price for their service to our country.,135
NA,Whilst the measures announced in this bill,135
NA,"help restore some balance, they can only be",135
NA,effective if they include the measures rec-,135
NA,ommended by this side of the House. This is,135
NA,about fixing an injustice. Labor has listened,135
NA,"to our nation's veterans, and it is time the",135
NA,coalition did the same. I commend the bill to,135
NA,"the House but, again, I urge the government",135
NA,to implement Labor's initiative for proper,135
NA,indexation of these pensions and to give,135
NA,these people the respect and income they,135
NA,deserve in the future.,135
Ms HALL ,Shortland) (5.39 pm)-I,135
NA,would like to start my contribution to this,135
NA,debate on the Social Security and Veterans',135
NA,Affairs Legislation Amendment (One-off,135
NA,Payments and Other 2007 Budget Measures),135
NA,Bill 2007 by endorsing the comments of the,135
NA,"previous speaker. In doing so, I recognise the",135
NA,fine contribution of all our veterans. I ac-,135
NA,knowledge the fact that this government has,135
NA,not treated them fairly and that the change,135
NA,that is in this legislation we are debating to-,135
NA,"night is just a very small measure, a very",135
NA,small step towards what should be done for,135
NA,Australian veterans.,135
NA,I would also like to acknowledge the work,136
NA,of the shadow minister and the proposal that,136
NA,he has put forward. I would like to state my,136
NA,full support for the policy and program that,136
NA,he has announced. It is only through full in-,136
NA,dexation that we will truly be looking after,136
NA,our disabled veterans-people who have,136
NA,been prepared to put their lives on the line,136
NA,for our country. But tonight I would like to,136
NA,direct my contributions to other areas of the,136
NA,"debate, as the area of veterans has been so",136
NA,ably covered by the three previous speakers.,136
NA,"Firstly, I would like to say that the",136
NA,changes have my 100 per cent support. My,136
NA,only comment is: this is too little too late.,136
NA,And there are so many people out there who,136
NA,are hurting that the government should be,136
NA,condemned for allowing a situation to de-,136
NA,velop where we have a large number of peo-,136
NA,ple in our community who are going without,136
NA,"on a daily basis, whilst they cynically come",136
NA,"in, in the shadow of an election, and throw",136
NA,out one-off payments.,136
NA,I do not want my words to speak for the,136
NA,hurt that is being felt in the community;,136
NA,"rather, I thought I would allow the words of",136
NA,my constituents to say what has been hap-,136
NA,pening to them and just how hard they are,136
NA,finding it. The letter that I am going to start,136
NA,with will demonstrate to the parliament very,136
NA,graphically just how important this $500 will,136
NA,be to one pensioner in the electorate of,136
NA,Shortland. This constituent is a lady for,136
NA,whom I have written some letters in relation,136
NA,"to the increased costs in the PBS, and she",136
NA,talks about new increases and cutbacks. I,136
NA,will come in on her letter at the point where,136
NA,she says:,136
NA,"... it is a sad, sick & sorry joke that we only",136
NA,ceive $500 per fortnight-which covers [prescrip-,136
NA,tions] & yesterday I had to pay $26.40 for my,136
NA,fortnightly necessities-so little food till next,136
NA,pension day.,136
NA,‘... so little food till next pension day'.,136
NA,I had a fire in my flat (stove & range hood are to,136
NA,"be replaced, thank the Lord), and this added to",136
NA,"my stress-I am having counselling for shock,",136
NA,"trauma, emotional exhaustion & “shot to smither-",136
NA,eens nerves” ...,136
NA,That is just a disgrace. She has been rejected,136
NA,by charities and she has been begging for,136
NA,"money, just to pay for the necessities of daily",136
NA,"life. No matter what she does, nothing seems",136
NA,to help. She says:,136
NA,It is quite disgusting & deplorable that the,136
NA,Government have taken away our rights & not,136
NA,[given] us more money to meet our increasing,136
NA,"costs as our pensions shrink-no integrity, diplo-",136
NA,macy or dignity left & these ever increasing in-,136
NA,"sults are totally unacceptable, “beyond the pale”,",136
NA,NOT Australian and leave everything to be de-,136
NA,sired.,136
NA,She goes on a little more in her letter about,136
NA,her problems. She talks about how she has,136
NA,tried to secure food vouchers and how she is,136
NA,trying to manage to get her stove and other,136
NA,"whitegoods fixed, and asks me to give her a",136
NA,"contribution. And, of course, I will help her",136
NA,"out. But I think it is very sad that, in our so-",136
NA,"ciety, we have a situation where people are",136
NA,suffering in that way. She is just someone's,136
NA,"mum, an ordinary pensioner, who is doing it",136
NA,hard. And I know that she will really wel-,136
NA,come the $500 that she will be eligible for.,136
NA,But it should never have gone on that long.,136
NA,She should never have been in a situation,136
NA,where she was forced-forced-to write a,136
NA,begging letter like that to a member of par-,136
NA,liament.,136
NA,I have recently surveyed my electorate.,136
NA,What came out very clearly in those surveys,136
NA,was the battle that pensioners are having on a,136
NA,day-to-day basis to survive. The three most,136
NA,reimportant issues relate to increased petrol,136
NA,prices-and the impact that has on their abil-,136
NA,ity to survive-health and dental costs. In,136
NA,"this particular survey my constituent said,",136
NA,‘Pensions do not cover increases of daily,136
NA,living.' The next one refers to the price of,136
NA,petrol and how the price of everything in life,137
NA,is increasing. I have another one in which,137
NA,they refer to the impact that petrol prices,137
NA,have had on their ability to pay for things.,137
NA,This demonstrates how much this $500 bo-,137
NA,nus is needed. I would now like to quote a,137
NA,pensioner in my electorate: ‘I only go to doc-,137
NA,tors when it is absolutely urgent because I,137
NA,can't find the $52 I need to pay the doctor.',137
NA,"Another one wrote, ‘High price of fruit and",137
NA,vegetables-inflation rate is a joke.' Another,137
NA,constituent wrote: ‘With two living on a pen-,137
NA,sion'-and I think this is a very important,137
NA,comment-‘it only takes one illness on top,137
NA,of a chronic illness to wreck the budget.' And,137
NA,from another constituent:,137
NA,The pension will only stretch so far then savings,137
NA,and superannuation have to be used-once they,137
NA,have run out-who knows?,137
NA,I will not read the next one because it is quite,137
NA,"critical of the government, and I think I have",137
NA,adequately made my point. I wholeheartedly,137
NA,embrace the fact that money is going to our,137
NA,pensioners. But I do implore the government,137
NA,"to be a little kinder, a little more aware",137
NA,is not only when an election is called but at,137
NA,all times that pensioners are doing it hard.,137
NA,I am very pleased to see in this legislation,137
NA,that the government have rectified a problem,137
NA,that arose a few years back when they failed,137
NA,"to pay $25,000 to veterans who were prison-",137
NA,"ers of war in Europe during World War II,",137
NA,"yet they paid $25,000 to those veterans who",137
NA,were interred in Japanese prison camps. I,137
NA,think this rectifies a mistake that occurred,137
NA,back then. It caused great division within the,137
NA,veterans community. I support that inclusion,137
NA,in the budget.,137
NA,One thing I am very upset about is that,137
NA,disability support pensioners have been ig-,137
NA,nored. To demonstrate the impact this has,137
NA,"had, I would like to refer to three people who",137
NA,rang my office today. For the benefit of the,137
NA,"Minister for Families, Community Services",137
NA,"and Indigenous Affairs, we have had a num-",137
NA,ber of phone calls in our office today from,137
NA,people who are very disturbed about that.,137
NA,One young girl does some volunteer work in,137
NA,my office. She had a brain tumour and had it,137
NA,removed. She is quite disabled. She has a,137
NA,lovely personality and tries very hard. But,137
NA,she was so angry that she is not to be treated,137
NA,in the same way that aged pensioners and,137
NA,retirees are. She feels that her needs are just,137
NA,"as great, and she feels that a stigma is at-",137
NA,tached to the fact that she is not being,137
NA,granted the same one-off payment that other,137
NA,pensioners are. The second person I would,137
NA,like to refer to is a man who rang my office.,137
NA,He was in tears. He cried to my staff member,137
NA,for four or five minutes. My staff member,137
NA,found it very difficult to handle. My con-,137
NA,"stituent's parting comment was, ‘What's the",137
NA,point in going on? I may as well top myself.',137
NA,"I am quite concerned about that person, and I",137
NA,am hopeful that I will be able to get in touch,137
NA,with him later tonight.,137
NA,The government have ignored a group of,137
NA,that it people who probably have higher medical,137
NA,needs and higher expenses than ordinary,137
NA,pensioners and have refused to extend the,137
NA,one-off payment to them. I received another,137
NA,phone call in my office from a woman who,137
NA,asked us to send her a membership form to,137
NA,join the Labor Party. She was so upset that,137
NA,the government had decided that they would,137
NA,not extend the one-off payment to people on,137
NA,"the disability support pension. Therefore, I",137
NA,have increased the number of branch mem-,137
NA,bers by one because of the government's,137
NA,inaction.,137
NA,There is no way I will oppose this legisla-,137
NA,"tion. It contains too little, it has come too",137
NA,"late, particularly in areas relating to veterans.",137
NA,I am pleased about the funeral benefit being,137
NA,increased. It has been an issue that veterans,137
NA,have been most concerned about for a period,137
NA,of time. But I implore the government to,137
NA,adopt the policy as outlined by the shadow,137
NA,minister. It is a good policy and it recognises,138
NA,the needs of veterans. I hope the government,138
NA,finds a place in its heart to look after those,138
NA,people whom it has chosen to ignore in this,138
NA,budget. It should realise that there are many,138
NA,people who need the government's assis-,138
NA,"tance, not just the ones it hopes to bribe on",138
NA,the eve of an election.,138
Mr BROUGH ,Longman-Minister for,138
NA,"Families, Community Services and Indige-",138
NA,nous Affairs and Minister Assisting the,138
NA,Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (5.51,138
NA,pm)-I would like to thank all the members,138
NA,who have participated in the debate on the,138
NA,Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment,138
NA,"(2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007, but quite",138
NA,frankly some of the comments that have just,138
NA,come from the other side are so disgraceful,138
NA,that they do not actually warrant being,138
NA,thanked. The fact is that not once in 13 years,138
NA,did the Labor Party pay a bonus to any pen-,138
NA,sioner. There was a good reason for that-,138
NA,because what they did was to actually mort-,138
NA,gage the future of those same peoples',138
NA,grandchildren and children. They asked them,138
NA,to pay for their wanton expenditure as an,138
NA,incompetent government and did not give,138
NA,them a damn cent. Yet the members of the,138
NA,"opposition have the hide to come in here, one",138
NA,"after another, and be so pious as to presume",138
NA,that this government somehow has left,138
NA,somebody out. I say to the member opposite:,138
NA,tell this to your constituents about disabili-,138
NA,ties-that I went to the ministerial council,138
NA,recently with all of the state and territory,138
NA,ministers and I put on the table this offer.,138
NA,Ms Hall interjecting-,138
Mr BROUGH,"You, Madam, should lis-",138
NA,ten and take this back. What we offered-,138
NA,"and what you, Madam, should tell your con-",138
NA,stituents-to the states was that the federal,138
NA,"government, over and above-",138
NA,"Mr Bowen- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise",138
NA,on a point of order. Remarks should be ad-,138
NA,dressed through you not directly to the mem-,138
NA,ber.,138
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. AM,138
NA,Somlyay)-The minister will address his,138
NA,comments through the chair.,138
NA,"Ms Hall- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a",138
NA,point of order. The minister should refer to a,138
NA,member by their electorate not by any other,138
NA,title.,138
Mr BROUGH,I say to the honourable,138
NA,"member, and I mean this quite sincerely:",138
NA,would you please go back to your disabled,138
NA,constituent-,138
NA,"Mr Bowen- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise",138
NA,on a point of order. The minister is clearly,138
NA,flouting your ruling.,138
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,There is no,138
NA,point of order.,138
Mr BROUGH,I say to the honourable,138
NA,"member who sits opposite that, when negoti-",138
NA,ating the next five-year agreement with the,138
NA,states and territories about the Common-,138
NA,"wealth-state disability agreement, I put it to",138
NA,the state and territory ministers that the,138
NA,Commonwealth would again enter into a,138
NA,five-year agreement with the same funding,138
NA,"plus $400 million indexation. Then, to meet",138
NA,the unmet need for supported accommoda-,138
NA,"tion and respite care, we asked each state and",138
NA,territory to come back to the Commonwealth,138
NA,with an individual plan to address the needs,138
NA,"of people with disabilities. I said, ‘Come",138
NA,back to us with a plan that will deliver places,138
NA,for supported accommodation and respite,138
NA,care and the Commonwealth will consider,138
NA,each of those plans on a dollar-for-dollar,138
NA,basis.' I put that directly to those ministers.,138
NA,What they did at that meeting was to adjourn,138
NA,"the meeting, caucus outside for 10 minutes,",138
NA,"come back inside, read a written statement",138
NA,and close the meeting without further com-,138
NA,ment. It was a reprehensible piece of behav-,138
NA,iour by people who are supposed to be repre-,138
NA,senting those people most vulnerable in our,138
NA,community. Every single one of those people,139
NA,was a Labor minister. The offer we put was,139
NA,"then put again in writing, asking the state",139
NA,territory governments to bring a plan forward,139
NA,to the Commonwealth so that we could fund,139
NA,the need for supported accommodation.,139
NA,"Ms Hall- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a",139
NA,point of order. Whilst I find what the minis-,139
NA,"ter has to say most interesting, I raise the",139
NA,point of relevance in relation to the legisla-,139
NA,tion we are debating today.,139
The DEPUTY SPEAKER,The minis-,139
NA,ter's contribution is relevant. There is no,139
NA,point of order.,139
Mr BROUGH,We are dealing with the,139
NA,issue of one-off payments to carers who look,139
NA,after people with disabilities. Given the,139
NA,comments of the honourable member oppo-,139
NA,"site, this could not be more pertinent to the",139
NA,issue of helping people with disabilities-,139
NA,who have been totally neglected by state,139
NA,premiers and ministers. I wrote to each of the,139
NA,state ministers. Not one of them has re-,139
NA,sponded. So I wrote again today to the state,139
NA,"ministers and said, ‘You have one month to",139
NA,put an offer on the table of how you will,139
NA,"meet, as states and territories, the responsi-",139
NA,bility of providing respite care and supported,139
NA,accommodation for people with disabilities;,139
NA,and the Commonwealth will consider a dol-,139
NA,lar-for-dollar funding arrangement.',139
NA,The Commonwealth will not run away,139
NA,from the needs of people with disabilities.,139
NA,We will not hide behind the fact that the,139
NA,states have failed these people miserably; we,139
NA,will stand up for them. We should be trying,139
NA,to do this in a way which is bipartisan with,139
NA,state and territory governments. Minister,139
NA,"Della Bosca wrote to some Liberal senators,",139
NA,"and I got the letters. He said, ‘Why doesn't",139
NA,the Commonwealth enter into a dollar-for-,139
NA,dollar arrangement like we did for young,139
NA,people in nursing homes.' That is the exact,139
NA,point I made to his disabilities minister. So,139
NA,Minister Della Bosca from New South,139
NA,"Wales, your own home state, agrees. All we",139
NA,and want is for people to get on and actually do,139
NA,something positive. So can you please take,139
NA,that back? I would be delighted if you would.,139
NA,The members opposite made a lot of the,139
NA,fact that pensioners do not have enough,139
NA,money. If it had not been for the Common-,139
NA,wealth introducing twice-yearly indexation,139
NA,and linking the aged pension to not only CPI,139
NA,"but also wages, because wages have gone up",139
NA,"20 per cent under this government, pension-",139
NA,ers today would be $66.20 a fortnight worse,139
NA,off on the single rate. That is how much bet-,139
NA,ter they are off per fortnight on the single,139
NA,rate as a result of our decision to formally,139
NA,link it to 25 per cent of MATWE. The Labor,139
NA,Party never did that. We are providing not,139
NA,only those additional income streams every,139
NA,"fortnight but also, because the economy has",139
NA,been run in a strong and responsible way and,139
NA,because we want people who are no longer,139
NA,in the workforce to be able to participate in,139
NA,"the wealth of this nation, $1,000 for couples",139
NA,and $500 for individuals. Yet those opposite,139
NA,come in here and whinge. It did not happen,139
NA,in 13 years of Labor government. My bet is,139
NA,"that, with their irresponsible way of running",139
NA,"an economy, it would not happen if they",139
NA,were ever re-elected.,139
NA,These measures today go to the heart of a,139
NA,compassionate government providing sup-,139
NA,port when you can afford it directly to those,139
NA,"who need it the most. For argument's sake,",139
NA,"let us remember the $25,000 one-off com-",139
NA,pensation payment paid to our civilian and,139
NA,war internees interned by enemy forces in,139
NA,Europe and our veterans who were prisoners,139
NA,of war. This followed on from the heartfelt,139
NA,"and warmly appreciated $25,000 paid previ-",139
NA,ously to those who were POWs of the Japa-,139
NA,"nese. You and I both know very well, be-",139
NA,cause I know that both of our electorates,139
NA,"have very large veterans communities, that",139
NA,this will be welcomed not only directly by,139
NA,those individuals but also by the wider com-,140
NA,munity. They know the pain that those peo-,140
NA,"ple went through, and that pain and suffering",140
NA,has been recognised in this very practical,140
NA,way.,140
NA,"The one-off payments, as I have said, are",140
NA,responsible. They are responsible because it,140
NA,is money that the government has not had to,140
NA,borrow. Running a strong economy with two,140
NA,"million more Australians in work, and there-",140
NA,fore fewer outgoings in the form of welfare,140
NA,"payments, and not having to pay $8.5 billion",140
NA,in interest on accumulated debt that the lot,140
NA,opposite ran up when they were in govern-,140
NA,ment means that that is money you can re-,140
NA,turn to people who need it. I know that many,140
NA,in my electorate and in the electorates of all,140
NA,"honourable members, regardless of which",140
NA,"side of the chamber they come from, will",140
NA,greatly appreciate these payments.,140
NA,"This bill also increases, through the Veter-",140
NA,"ans' Entitlements Act 1986, the maximum",140
NA,amount of funeral benefit payable from,140
NA,"$1,000 to $2,000. The doubling of that bene-",140
NA,"fit will be a great comfort to, and the contri-",140
NA,bution to the funeral will be greatly appreci-,140
NA,"ated by, family members. I applaud the Min-",140
NA,ister for Veterans' Affairs for the wonderful,140
NA,work that he has done since he has taken,140
NA,"over this portfolio in being able to secure,",140
NA,"through this budget, an intermediate rate dis-",140
NA,ability payment in the Veterans' Entitlements,140
NA,Act-an increase of $25 per fortnight-and,140
NA,an increase of $50 per fortnight in the,140
NA,amount of the special rate disability pension.,140
NA,It will extend the maximum period for back-,140
NA,dating of war widows or widower pensions,140
NA,from three to six months in certain circum-,140
NA,"stances, and the backdating rules will ensure",140
NA,that those dependants or veterans who are,140
NA,not automatically eligible for the war wid-,140
NA,ows or widower pension are not financially,140
NA,disadvantaged during such a difficult time.,140
NA,"Carers really are the unsung heroes, and I",140
NA,am sure that is one thing both sides of this,140
NA,chamber will always agree on. Nothing cuts,140
NA,"more to the quick, particularly when you sit",140
NA,"and talk with older carers, than their fear of",140
NA,what will occur when they themselves are,140
NA,too frail and aged to look after their children.,140
NA,These people have given so much of their,140
NA,lives for the ones they care for-and they are,140
NA,only the older ones. There are also younger,140
NA,carers who have responsibility way beyond,140
NA,their years. We all applaud what they do.,140
NA,"This is not, as some members so glibly put,",140
NA,something done in an election year. For the,140
NA,fourth consecutive year we have been in a,140
NA,"position to be able to make a $1,000 one-off",140
NA,"payment for those receiving, on the 8 May,",140
NA,either a social security carer payment or a,140
NA,veterans carer service pension. Carers receiv-,140
NA,ing the non-means-tested allowance in addi-,140
NA,tion to either wife pension or veterans part-,140
NA,"ner service pension will also get the $1,000",140
NA,one-off payment. Any carer receiving the,140
NA,carer allowance will be paid a separate $600,140
NA,one-off payment for all eligible care receiv-,140
NA,ers.,140
NA,"I know from personal experience, from",140
NA,"talking to these people, how much they ap-",140
NA,preciate that and I am just so pleased that the,140
NA,government has been in a position-because,140
NA,we have a strong economy and for the rea-,140
NA,sons we have outlined of people being back,140
NA,in work and not having to put this money,140
NA,into paying off debt-where those people,140
NA,will benefit. I hope that we are in a position,140
NA,in future years to be able to continue these,140
NA,measures so that the money can make a dif-,140
NA,ference in being able to perhaps buy some,140
NA,little luxury or pay off some debt like the car,140
NA,repair bills that come in for people who do,140
NA,not have the capacity-because the love and,140
NA,compassion they have for those they care for,140
NA,does not give them the time to do so. That is,140
NA,what being in government is really all about.,140
NA,It is about having an economy that allows,140
NA,you to deliver those dividends to everyone,141
NA,and to deliver them in such a way that peo-,141
NA,ple's lives can be improved. It is not just,141
NA,those in the workforce who get the tax cuts,141
NA,and the improvements in wage increases.,141
NA,Everyone in a just society gets to benefit.,141
NA,Not only do I commend this bill to the,141
NA,House but also I appeal to all those opposite,141
NA,to talk to their state and territory colleagues,141
NA,and to listen to what the federal government,141
NA,has put on the table here-the offer to help,141
NA,people with disabilities in the most substan-,141
NA,tial way by giving us a plan on how to pro-,141
NA,vide the right sort of supported accommoda-,141
NA,tion and appropriate respite care. The Com-,141
NA,monwealth has made a commitment straight,141
NA,"to them, looking them in the eye and in writ-",141

NA,BILL 2007,141
NA,Second Reading,141
NA,Debate resumed.,141
Mr BOWEN ,Prospect) (6.06 pm)-The,141
NA,Superannuation Laws Amendment (2007,141
NA,Budget Co-contribution Measure) Bill 2007,141
NA,seeks approval for a one-off additional gov-,141
NA,ernment contribution to the superannuation,141
NA,accounts of those people who made eligible,141
NA,"contributions in the 2005-06 income year, as",141
NA,announced in last night's budget. This legis-,141
NA,lation will effectively double the government,141
NA,contribution for those who have already,141
NA,made voluntary contributions in the 2005-06,141
NA,financial year. The cost is estimated at $1.1,141
NA,"billion, with most payments being made in",141
NA,this financial year at a cost of $990 million.,141
NA,Labor is supporting this bill.,141
NA,The co-contribution scheme grants a $1.50,141
NA,government contribution for a $1.00 em-,141
NA,"ployee contribution, capped at a maximum",141
NA,"government payment of $1,500. The current",141
NA,a sucscheme allows the maximum government co-,141
NA,"contribution of $1,500 to be paid up to the",141
NA,"income threshold of $28,000 and phasing",141
NA,down at a rate of 5c for every dollar of in-,141
NA,come above the threshold and then com-,141
NA,"pletely phasing out at $58,000.",141
NA,"Up until 1987, the benefits of superannua-",141
NA,tion generally flowed to only 40 per cent of,141
NA,"the workforce-in the main, middleand",141
NA,high-income earners. The majority of lowto,141
NA,middle-income earners-often people in,141
NA,casual and part-time occupations such as,141
NA,"retail, hospitality and transport, of which",141
NA,over 60 per cent were women-did not re-,141
NA,ceive superannuation payments. It is one of,141
NA,the most abiding and proud achievements of,141
NA,the Hawke and Keating governments that,141
NA,that is no longer the case. Labor introduced a,141
NA,compulsory superannuation scheme using,142
NA,the principle of basic fairness to spread su-,142
NA,perannuation coverage to all employees earn-,142
NA,ing more than $450 a month. This represents,142
NA,not just a critical social policy but also,142
NA,important economic policy. One of the big-,142
NA,gest challenges that was facing this nation in,142
NA,the 1980s and 1990s was how to lift our sav-,142
NA,"ings rates, and the superannuation scheme",142
NA,was a huge addition to the national effort to,142
NA,do that.,142
NA,Savings is no longer the issue that it was,142
NA,in the 1980s and 1990s. Today there is in,142
NA,excess of $1 trillion in superannuation sav-,142
NA,"ings, which has been overwhelmingly driven",142
NA,by the Superannuation Guarantee-the re-,142
NA,form of the last Labor government. The gov-,142
NA,ernment now pretend to be friends of super-,142
NA,annuation. They vigorously opposed these,142
NA,reforms at the time. They criticise us for op-,142
NA,posing some of their measures and say that,142
NA,they supported all of our good reforms in the,142
NA,eighties and nineties. They supported some,142
NA,of them but they did not support superannua-,142
NA,tion.,142
NA,The one-off increase in the legislation that,142
NA,we are discussing tonight does deserve some,142
NA,comment. The one-off increase represents a,142
NA,rebuff to my honourable friend the Assistant,142
NA,"Treasurer, who in a splash-as I recall, it was",142
NA,a front page splash-in the Australian earlier,142
NA,in the year sought an ongoing expansion of,142
NA,the scheme for those up to 45 years of age. It,142
NA,was not a one-off payment but an ongoing,142
NA,expansion for many years to come-a major,142
NA,addition. This is not what we saw in the,142
NA,"budget. The Assistant Treasurer, unfortu-",142
NA,"nately, was clearly rebuffed in the Expendi-",142
NA,ture Review Committee.,142
NA,The co-contribution scheme is supported,142
NA,by Labor and will be continued if Labor are,142
NA,successful in winning office later this year.,142
NA,We support any sensible and reasonable,142
NA,measure to increase the superannuation sav-,142
NA,"ings of Australians and, as such, we support",142
NA,"this bill. However, there are a couple of in-",142
NA,consistencies that we feel duty bound to,142
NA,"point out. Yesterday in the Australian, on the",142
NA,"a very morning of the budget, there was a drop-a",142
NA,conveniently leaked article-which de-,142
NA,scribed the impending announcement as:,142
NA,It is a way ... to help ... encourage younger people,142
NA,to invest in superannuation ...,142
NA,Let us call this measure for what it is. This is,142
NA,an important addition to the superannuation,142
NA,savings of low-income earners. We accept,142
NA,that. That is why we are supporting it. But let,142
NA,us not pretend that it is something that it is,142
NA,not. Let us call it what it is. It is not an en-,142
NA,couragement for people to put more money,142
NA,"into superannuation. If that is what it is, it",142
NA,would be prospective not retrospective. We,142
NA,would be saying: ‘If you put in more money,142
NA,"in the coming financial year, we'll match it",142
NA,to a greater level than we have in the past.,142
NA,We'll double our matching.' But that is not,142
NA,what this is.,142
NA,"Mr Ciobo-Yes, it is.",142
Mr BOWEN,I look forward to hearing,142
NA,the honourable member for Moncrieff tell us,142
NA,how it is and why the Chief Executive of the,142
NA,Australian Superannuation Funds Associa-,142
NA,tion is wrong. Tell us why Philippa Smith is,142
NA,incorrect. I will not be able to stay in the,142
NA,"chamber to hear it, but I will be listening in.",142
NA,Philippa Smith said:,142
NA,There was disappointment because it was only a,142
NA,one-off for past contributions ... the budget had,142
NA,missed an opportunity to change savings behav-,142
NA,iour.,142
NA,"Further, she said:",142
NA,This initiative rewards individuals who accessed,142
NA,"the co-contribution a year ago, but it is difficult to",142
NA,see how it will encourage younger people to in-,142
NA,vest in their retirement future going forward.,142
NA,I am sure the honourable member for Mon-,142
NA,crieff will take up a substantial part of his 20,142
NA,minutes explaining why the Australian Su-,142
NA,perannuation Funds Association is wrong. I,143
NA,am sure that we will see the headlines in the,143
NA,Australian tomorrow: ‘Ciobo attacks Smith'.,143
NA,It is not the member for Perth-and what is,143
NA,Tony's seat?,143
NA,Mr Ciobo-Casey.,143
Mr BOWEN,and not the member for,143
NA,"Casey. It is Philippa Smith, from the Austra-",143
NA,lian Superannuation Funds Association. We,143
NA,are prepared to support this legislation. It,143
NA,adds to the savings of lowand middle-,143
NA,income earners-and that is a good thing.,143
NA,"We are prepared, as a responsible opposition,",143
NA,to say when the government does a good,143
NA,thing. We are prepared to say that we will,143
NA,support this bill and vote for it. But let us not,143
NA,pretend and let us not get high and mighty,143
NA,and say that this is a great reform which is,143
NA,encouraging more savings when it is not. It is,143
NA,an addition to savings that have already been,143
NA,"made and, on that basis, we will support it.",143
Mr CIOBO ,Moncrieff) (6.12 pm)-I am,143
NA,very pleased to add my support to the Super-,143
NA,annuation Laws Amendment (2007 Budget,143
NA,Co-contribution Measure) Bill 2007 and to,143
NA,address the previous speaker's comments.,143
NA,This is an important bill. It is one day after,143
NA,the introduction of the budget and the gov-,143
NA,ernment is already delivering on its prom-,143
NA,ises. Last evening the Treasurer spoke of the,143
NA,importance of making sure that younger gen-,143
NA,erations of Australians in particular are in-,143
NA,centivised to provide for their retirement. We,143
NA,know that we have an ageing population in,143
NA,"Australia. We know in Australia, as in many",143
NA,"other Western democracies around the world,",143
NA,that those aged 65 and over will represent an,143
NA,increasingly larger percentage of our total,143
NA,population base. One of the most fundamen-,143
NA,tal things that the government can do to ad-,143
NA,dress the ageing of the population is to en-,143
NA,"sure that, as much as possible, it encourages",143
NA,Australians to provide for their retirement.,143
NA,One key way in which the Howard gov-,143
NA,"ernment and particularly the Treasurer, Peter",143
NA,"Costello, have done this is through the gov-",143
NA,ernment's co-contribution scheme for super-,143
NA,annuation contributions. Australia is re-,143
NA,garded as having one of the finest superan-,143
NA,nuation and savings systems in the world. I,143
NA,am even happy to pay credit to the Australian,143
NA,Labor Party for the introduction of compul-,143
NA,sory superannuation. They had the idea and it,143
NA,was supported by us when we were in oppo-,143
NA,sition. The coalition supported the idea be-,143
NA,cause we saw it as a beneficial reform. So I,143
NA,am happy to acknowledge that the Australian,143
NA,Labor Party started this process.,143
NA,What we have in Australia is a situation,143
NA,"whereby we have been facilitating, over a",143
NA,"number of years now, the increasing transfer",143
NA,of wealth into people's retirement savings,143
NA,accounts in the form of superannuation. And,143
NA,"that is a very good thing because, as the",143
NA,"population ages, we will increasingly see the",143
NA,"need for Australians to draw down, in terms",143
NA,"of an annuity, a lump sum payment or some-",143
NA,thing like that-either of the two or some,143
NA,combination thereof-their retirement sav-,143
NA,"ings. The simple fact is that, with an ageing",143
NA,"population, the more we can encourage peo-",143
NA,"ple to provide for their retirement, the better",143
NA,off the nation will be. The co-contribution is,143
NA,one very meaningful and important initiative,143
NA,of this government that has helped to facili-,143
NA,tate people to place money into their retire-,143
NA,ment savings accounts to provide for their,143
NA,retirements so that they are not all drawing,143
NA,on the public purse.,143
NA,"What we know is that, as the Australian",143
NA,"population ages, and as the percentage of",143
NA,"those aged 65 and over grows, there will be-",143
NA,come a bigger draw-down on the public,143
NA,purse. And with more people moving into,143
NA,"retirement, and more people drawing down",143
NA,"on the public purse, there will be fewer peo-",143
NA,ple in the labour force who will be paying,143
NA,the taxes that will be used to fund the draw-,143
NA,"down. That really, in essence, is the reason",144
NA,we need to incentivise and encourage people,144
NA,to provide for their retirements.,144
NA,"The co-contribution-as I mentioned, an",144
NA,initiative of Peter Costello and this govern-,144
NA,ment-is particularly targeted at rewarding,144
NA,the effort of lower and middle income Aus-,144
NA,tralians in providing for their retirements. We,144
NA,did say that we took the initiative to intro-,144
NA,duce the co-contribution because we particu-,144
NA,larly wanted those on lower and middle in-,144
NA,comes to make sure that they are also recog-,144
NA,nising the power of compound interest and,144
NA,recognising the power that comes from them,144
NA,providing for their retirements in a more,144
NA,"meaningful way. Certainly, a nine per cent",144
NA,"contribution, at the minium level, is a start,",144
NA,but it is not enough.,144
NA,"Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay, I acknowl-",144
NA,edge that you and I sit on the House of Rep-,144
NA,"resentatives Economics Committee, which",144
NA,undertook an inquiry into the superannuation,144
NA,savings of generations X and Y. As I am sure,144
NA,"you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, we",144
NA,found that there does need to be incentive. A,144
NA,payment like this is particularly important as,144
NA,"well for women, because a large number of",144
NA,Australian women transition into and out of,144
NA,the Australian workforce. Particularly at,144
NA,"those times when, for example, many would",144
NA,choose to stay at home to raise a family and,144
NA,"not be in paid employment, the co-",144
NA,contribution does play an important role in,144
NA,helping to boost the superannuation sav-,144
NA,"ings-especially for women, for example,",144
NA,who may be undertaking part-time work. It is,144
NA,for that reason that this is a very good initiaParty,144
NA,tive and one that I am very pleased to sup-,144
NA,port.,144
NA,The bill that is moving through the House,144
NA,"this evening, which I am certain will be",144
NA,passed given that the opposition is also sup-,144
NA,"porting it, recognising it to be a very good",144
NA,decision by this government-I am sure that,144
NA,is why the opposition is supporting it-will,144
NA,ensure that we top up superannuation savings,144
NA,"that are being made. So, for those people",144
NA,who have already made a voluntary contribu-,144
NA,"tion to their superannuation, and received a",144
NA,"$1,500 top-up from the Australian govern-",144
NA,"ment, this bill will ensure that they receive",144
NA,"an additional $1,500 on top of that again.",144
NA,"That means that, for the $1,000 they have",144
NA,"invested, they are receiving a $3,000 top-up",144
NA,from the Australian government. That clearly,144
NA,is an incentive to make voluntary contribu-,144
NA,tions. It is that simple: if you receive a return,144
NA,of three to one then that is an incentive to be,144
NA,doing what you are doing. Whether it is pro-,144
NA,spective or retrospective is really neither,144
NA,here nor there. The fact is that those who,144
NA,have taken advantage of the co-contribution,144
NA,stand to gain the most. This additional,144
NA,"$1,500 top-up that can be received will go a",144
NA,long way to ensuring that there is more,144
NA,"money in the accounts of those Australians,",144
NA,especially lower and middle income earning,144
NA,"Australians, who have made the decision to",144
NA,voluntarily make contributions towards their,144
NA,superannuation. This comes at a cost of some,144
NA,$1.1 billion. That is for the time frame speci-,144
NA,"fied, which was for the last financial year.",144
NA,I listened with great interest to the Austra-,144
NA,"lian Labor Party, because what I heard from",144
NA,the shadow parliamentary secretary was that,144
NA,in fact more should have been done. I heard,144
NA,the shadow parliamentary secretary. Basi-,144
NA,"cally, if you read between the lines of what",144
NA,"he said, his statement was that this is a good",144
NA,"idea, and that is why the Australian Labor",144
NA,"is supporting it, but we should have",144
NA,"made it prospective, we should be ensuring",144
NA,that it is a three to one contribution for all the,144
NA,years in the forward estimates. This is again,144
NA,the problem that we have with the Australian,144
NA,Labor Party. We recognise that this is a good,144
NA,contribution. We recognise that it creates,144
NA,incentive. That is why the Australian Labor,144
NA,Party says there should be even more of it.,144
NA,But the problem we have as a government is,145
NA,that we are fiscally disciplined. If there is,145
NA,one fault that we have as a government it is,145
NA,that we are fiscally disciplined and we make,145
NA,"tough decisions about what is good, what is",145
NA,"achievable, what is affordable and what is",145
NA,sustainable. This $1.1 billion that the gov-,145
NA,ernment is pouring in to help these lower and,145
NA,middle income earning Australians will pay,145
NA,"big dividends for those people, especially",145
NA,"those at the lower end of the age spectrum,",145
NA,who have made contributions-big divi-,145
NA,"dends indeed, when it comes to their retire-",145
NA,ments.,145
NA,"The Australian Labor Party, I take it from",145
NA,the comments of the shadow parliamentary,145
NA,"secretary, is obviously of the view that its",145
NA,policy will be for there to be a three-to-one,145
NA,ratio going forward. I take it that is the Labor,145
NA,Party's position. I take it that the Labor,145
NA,Party's position-perhaps the policy that is,145
NA,being announced by Labor-is for there to,145
NA,be a three-to-one contribution from this point,145
NA,"forward. I look forward, if that is what the",145
NA,"Labor Party is going to do, to seeing that",145
NA,announcement. But I suspect that that is not,145
NA,actually the Labor Party's policy. It is just,145
NA,"another case, like the hollow drum beating,",145
NA,of the Australian Labor Party banging on and,145
NA,basically saying that we should have done,145
NA,more. We have done a lot-we have now,145
NA,tipped in another $1.1 billion-but the Labor,145
NA,"Party still says, ‘You should've done more.' I",145
NA,look forward to seeing the Labor Party's an-,145
NA,nouncement of policy. I look forward to,145
NA,hearing that the Labor Party's co-,145
NA,contribution will in fact be $3 on a prospec-,145
NA,tive basis. I am sure many people would be,145
NA,interested in a policy like that. It is just a,145
NA,"case, of course, of these things being costed.",145
NA,I am proud to be part of a government that,145
NA,has done more for Australian superannuation,145
NA,than any other government. And it is not just,145
NA,the co-contribution that I am referring to,145
NA,"now; it is the fact that this government, in",145
NA,"last year's budget, introduced the simplified",145
NA,superannuation reforms. These simplified,145
NA,"superannuation reforms, which the Austra-",145
NA,lian Labor Party took nearly six months to,145
NA,"agree to, will make a very big difference.",145
NA,The abolition of tax on withdrawals from a,145
NA,superannuation fund means so much to Aus-,145
NA,tralians that it is extraordinary to think that,145
NA,the Australian Labor Party would have taken,145
NA,nearly six months to agree.,145
NA,I note that the Assistant Treasurer is walk-,145
NA,ing into the chamber. I know he worked tire-,145
NA,lessly for months to try to get the Australian,145
NA,Labor Party on board with this government's,145
NA,reforms. I know the Assistant Treasurer kept,145
NA,as much pressure as he possibly could on the,145
NA,"Australian Labor Party, who dragged their",145
NA,"feet every step of the way before finally, af-",145
NA,"ter about six months, agreeing to support this",145
NA,"government's very sound, reasonable, wise",145
NA,and sustainable reforms that made superan-,145
NA,"nuation exceptionally simplified and, most",145
NA,"importantly, delivered in spades to the Aus-",145
NA,tralian people.,145
NA,I have to say that for my constituents on,145
NA,the Gold Coast the simplified superannuation,145
NA,reforms were welcomed with open arms.,145
NA,They knew these were vital reforms. They,145
NA,"welcomed them. It was music to their ears,",145
NA,as this government provided further incen-,145
NA,tives for Australians to ensure that they pro-,145
NA,vided for their superannuation. Like many of,145
NA,my constituents I was very disappointed that,145
NA,the Australian Labor Party took six months,145
NA,to agree to these very sound proposals. I am,145
NA,very pleased that they may have learned a,145
NA,lesson from that. And I am pleased that,145
NA,within a day of the budget being announced,145
NA,they are now on board with this additional,145
NA,co-contribution that the government has an-,145
NA,nounced. I commend the bill to the House in,145
NA,a resounding way.,145
Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR ,Gorton),145
NA,(6.24 pm)-Can I firstly correct the com-,145
NA,ments made by the member for Moncrieff,146
NA,with respect to his reference to the previous,146
NA,"speaker, the member for Prospect. The mem-",146
NA,ber for Prospect is the shadow Assistant,146
NA,Treasurer. I am sure he will want to take that,146
NA,up with the member for Moncrieff at a later,146
NA,date.,146
NA,I also indicate to the member for Mon-,146
NA,crieff and the House that Labor's concerns,146
NA,about the policy being retrospective rather,146
NA,than prospective is an issue. You cannot sug-,146
NA,"gest, as the government is suggesting, that",146
NA,there is an incentive to encourage younger,146
NA,people to invest in superannuation if the,146
NA,amount is paid after the investment has al-,146
NA,"ready been made. Therefore, it is wrong to",146
NA,say that the one-off payments made already,146
NA,in 2005-06 will encourage young people to,146
NA,save. It would make more sense to say to,146
NA,"young people, ‘If you make a voluntary con-",146
NA,tribution from a certain date then we will,146
NA,match this.' This would then be classified as,146
NA,"an incentive, as you would be encouraging",146
NA,bonuses for extra contributions made in the,146
NA,future. But the government has chosen to,146
NA,give the bonus payment for contributions,146
NA,already made. There were a number of con-,146
NA,cerns I had with the contribution by the,146
NA,member for Moncrieff. The two I have al-,146
NA,"ready mentioned are axiomatic, wrong",146
NA,"statements, and I thought I would correct",146
NA,them for his benefit.,146
NA,I also say to the House that we support the,146
NA,Superannuation Laws Amendment (2007,146
NA,Budget Co-contribution Measure) Bill 2007.,146
NA,It is a bill that provides a one-off additional,146
NA,government co-contribution into the super-,146
NA,annuation accounts of those people who,146
NA,made eligible contributions in 2005-06. We,146
NA,"support, in principle, the co-contribution.",146
NA,The legislation will effectively double the,146
NA,government's co-contribution for those who,146
NA,have already made voluntary contributions in,146
NA,the 2005-06 year.,146
NA,I will just reiterate the co-contribution,146
NA,scheme. The scheme grants a $1.50 govern-,146
NA,ment contribution for a $1 employee volun-,146
NA,"tary contribution, capped at a maximum gov-",146
NA,"ernment payment of $1,500. The current",146
NA,scheme allows a maximum government co-,146
NA,"contribution of $1,500 to be paid up to the",146
NA,"income threshold of $28,000, phasing down",146
NA,at a rate of 5c for every dollar of income,146
NA,above the threshold and completely phasing,146
NA,"out at $58,000 per annum.",146
NA,The original policy of co-contribution was,146
NA,announced by the then Keating Labor gov-,146
NA,ernment in 1995. It was to be a compulsory,146
NA,three per cent government scheme for all,146
NA,"employees, phased in between 1996 and",146
NA,"2002, delivering an extra $4.6 billion per",146
NA,year-in 1996-dollar values-when fully,146
NA,implemented. It was to build on Labor's,146
NA,compulsory nine per cent superannuation,146
NA,"guarantee, initially introduced at three per",146
NA,"cent in 1987. Twenty years ago, almost to the",146
NA,"day, a Labor government introduced compul-",146
NA,sory superannuation into this country and,146
NA,was opposed by the coalition. We understand,146
NA,that the coalition parties supported the prin-,146
NA,"ciple of super, but they did not support the",146
NA,legislation that was proposed by the then,146
NA,government to ensure that lowerand mid-,146
NA,dle-income families had proper retirement,146
NA,"savings. Indeed, there has been resistance by",146
NA,government with respect to superannuation,146
NA,"for many a year. Indeed, the Prime Minister,",146
NA,when he was Treasurer in the 1970s and,146
NA,"1980s, did not support a scheme that would",146
NA,provide superannuation to employees. There,146
NA,was no suggestion by any coalition govern-,146
NA,ment preceding the Hawke-Keating govern-,146
NA,"ment that there would be superannuation,",146
NA,"and there was resistance by those parties, in",146
NA,"opposition, to Keating's proposal to intro-",146
NA,duce superannuation.,146
NA,If we are going to consider the superannu-,146
NA,ation scheme and some of the add-ons that,146
NA,the government suggests-and which Labor,146
NA,supports-we should put the superannuation,147
NA,debate in context and remind the government,147
NA,and the people of Australia that it was a La-,147
NA,bor government that introduced the super,147
NA,"scheme, with resistance from coalition par-",147
NA,"ties. Indeed, it is such good public policy to",147
NA,ensure that lowand middle-income families,147
NA,are able to secure their retirement that it is,147
NA,"difficult, even for a government that opposes",147
NA,"such policies, to change. So it is not",147
NA,"ing that, along with Medicare, the compul-",147
NA,sory superannuation scheme introduced by,147
NA,Labor governments preceding the Howard,147
NA,"government's election in 1996, have not been",147
NA,altered adversely to affect lowand middle-,147
NA,income families. But there is no doubt that,147
NA,that government has failed to continue pro-,147
NA,viding a contribution that will ensure the,147
NA,security of low-and middle-income families,147
NA,in Australia. There has been no support for,147
NA,the initial scheme to have a 15 per cent con-,147
NA,tribution that would provide the security for,147
NA,lowand middle-income families in Austra-,147
NA,lia. That is a personal disappointment; I,147
NA,ported the scheme that was put together.,147
NA,I think people should remember how that,147
NA,came about. I think people are quite ready to,147
NA,"forget, if they are not reminded, how super-",147
NA,annuation came about in this country. It cer-,147
NA,tainly was not initiated by the mob on the,147
NA,"other side. Indeed, there was resistance by",147
NA,the coalition parties at the time. Let us re-,147
NA,member that the first compulsory contribu-,147
NA,tion component was introduced in 1987 by,147
NA,the Keating government in consultation with,147
NA,industry and unions. As the government likes,147
NA,"to remind us, there were occasions in which",147
NA,wages were suspended or suppressed to en-,147
NA,sure that other benefits would flow on to,147
NA,working families and the nation as a whole.,147
NA,"Recalling the 1987 legislation, we should",147
NA,be reminded that people forwent a wage in-,147
NA,crease to commence the first stages of what,147
NA,has become one of the most amazing na-,147
NA,tional retirement schemes in the world. In,147
NA,December last year the amount of money,147
NA,that Australians invested in superannuation,147
NA,"passed the $1 trillion mark. That is $1,000",147
NA,"billion under super funds management, or",147
NA,"$50,000 for every man, woman and child in",147
NA,this country. Whilst we support the add-on,147
NA,"that has occurred today, it is important to",147
NA,place this debate in the context of the fact,147
NA,"that, without some bold initiatives by a for-",147
NA,"surprisward-thinking government, this scheme",147
NA,would not be there to add on to. If we had,147
NA,had to wait for the Prime Minister when he,147
NA,was Treasurer in the eighties or if we had,147
NA,listened to the opposition during the Hawke-,147
NA,Keating period there would not be this na-,147
NA,tional retirement scheme.,147
NA,It is also important to note that this,147
NA,scheme has ensured more security for low-,147
NA,and middle-income families in this nation as,147
NA,a result of the benefits of the funds. Looking,147
NA,at why there has been 15 years of consecu-,147
NA,"tive economic growth, the trillion dollars",147
NA,amassed by super funds has underpinned,147
NA,sup- such economic prosperity. We should note,147
NA,"that it fuels the stock market, it encourages",147
NA,business investment and it builds on an un-,147
NA,precedented bank of national savings. Along,147
NA,the way it has potentially transformed re-,147
NA,"tirement for cashed-up baby boomers, shift-",147
NA,ing reliance away from the age pension and,147
NA,providing higher living standards. Those,147
NA,things should be remembered when we de-,147
NA,bate this bill. This bill is just a brick that has,147
NA,been put on top of the Empire State Building.,147
NA,"It is not a major reform, but we do support it.",147
NA,It will actually provide some benefit to,147
NA,young people and people who have already,147
NA,"placed money into superannuation funds, but",147
NA,I think it is important to place the debate in,147
NA,the context of why we have such a good na-,147
NA,tional retirement scheme.,147
NA,I also want to place on the record what,147
NA,"Australia was like in the late eighties, when",147
NA,we did not have this scheme to reform. As,147
NA,"the member for Prospect indicated, the ma-",147
NA,jority of workers did not receive superannua-,148
NA,tion. My parents and many of their friends,148
NA,were not in a superannuation scheme. They,148
NA,did not work in the public sector; they were,148
NA,not managers or working in senior positions.,148
NA,Whilst in the factories in which they worked,148
NA,their senior managers would have been in,148
NA,"receipt of superannuation, in that period my",148
NA,parents and others like them were not in re-,148
NA,ceipt of any superannuation benefit. It is,148
NA,such a critical issue for lowand middle-,148
NA,income families because they do not always,148
NA,have the capacity to save in the way in which,148
NA,higher income families do; they do not have,148
NA,the wherewithal to put away a lot of money,148
NA,because they are expending it on goods and,148
NA,services required for their families. They,148
NA,not in the position that higher income earners,148
NA,are. People in the eighties were looking for,148
NA,schemes that would provide them future as-,148
NA,sistance. Unfortunately for my parents and,148
NA,"people of that age, they probably did not",148
NA,benefit as much as those who have come,148
NA,after them. Those people born in the late for-,148
NA,"ties, the fifties and the sixties have been",148
NA,greater beneficiaries of the reforms of the,148
NA,superannuation scheme in the Hawke-,148
NA,Keating period. I am glad to see that this,148
NA,government has realised it is a scheme worth,148
NA,"amending, reforming and improving wher-",148
NA,ever it can.,148
NA,"But I am concerned, and I am sure Labor",148
NA,"is concerned, that we did not go further with",148
NA,the nine per cent. Whilst these one-off pay-,148
NA,"ments can, if the money is given after the",148
NA,"investment is made, create an incentive for",148
NA,"people to invest in their retirement savings,",148
NA,whilst these one-off payments are okay and,148
NA,whilst these co-contribution efforts have in-,148
NA,"creased the likelihood of people saving,",148
NA,"which I think is a good thing, it is a shame",148
NA,we have not gone beyond the nine per cent,148
NA,since it was promised in 1995. It was some-,148
NA,thing that we should have proceeded with as,148
NA,"a nation, but we failed to do so. Having said",148
NA,"that, it is a remarkable thing that we now",148
NA,"find ourselves with more than $1,000 billion",148
NA,dollars in our national retirement savings,148
NA,scheme.,148
NA,It is important to note that the effort today,148
NA,is a rather meagre one in the context of the,148
NA,"entire area of superannuation, but it is sup-",148
NA,ported by Labor. It will benefit a significant,148
NA,"number of people, but I think the govern-",148
NA,ment could have gone further in tackling it,148
NA,since its election to its first term in 1996. I do,148
NA,not think the government was ideologically,148
NA,predisposed to support a compulsory super-,148
NA,"annuation scheme. That is unfortunate, be-",148
NA,cause we would have found many more mil-,148
NA,lions of Australians better off had the gov-,148
NA,are ernment chosen to continue on with the good,148
NA,work of the Hawke and Keating govern-,148
NA,"ments, which created this scheme in the first",148
NA,place.,148
NA,I would also like to reinforce the concerns,148
NA,that were expressed by the Chief Executive,148
NA,Officer of the Association of Superannuation,148
NA,"Funds of Australia, Ms Philippa Smith, who",148
NA,"stated, ‘There was disappointment because it",148
NA,was only a one-off for past contributions'-,148
NA,"as I have already indicated, the concern that",148
NA,it was not really creating a genuine incentive.,148
NA,"Indeed, she went on to say that ‘the budget",148
NA,had missed an opportunity to change savings,148
NA,behaviour'. I think those comments are apt.,148
NA,"It is a bill that we can support, but it is not",148
NA,bold. It does not deliver what it really should,148
NA,"be delivering. In the end, it is something that",148
NA,"Labor will support, but Labor just thinks it",148
NA,falls short of the mark of what is required for,148
NA,our superannuation scheme in this country.,148
Mr DUTTON ,Dickson-Minister for,148
NA,Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (6.38,148
NA,pm)-in reply-I would like to thank all of,148
NA,the members who have taken part in the de-,148
NA,bate on the Superannuation Laws Amend-,148
NA,ment (2007 Budget Co-contribution Meas-,148
NA,ure) Bill 2007. This bill will further boost,148
NA,superannuation savings by doubling the gov-,149
NA,ernment superannuation co-contribution pay-,149
NA,able to lowand middleincome earners in,149
NA,respect of eligible contributions made in the,149
NA,"2005-06 year-for example, if a person was",149
NA,otherwise eligible for a co-contribution of,149
NA,"$1,500 for the 2005-06 year, they will now",149
NA,"receive an extra co-contribution of $1,500 so",149
NA,that the total contribution for that year would,149
NA,"be $3,000. This rewards eligible lowto",149
NA,middle-income Australians who have saved,149
NA,for their retirement and builds on the already,149
NA,successful government co-contribution,149
NA,scheme and the significant improvements to,149
NA,superannuation that the government has,149
NA,made through the recent simplified superan-,149
NA,nuation reforms.,149
NA,This government introduced the co-,149
NA,contribution scheme in 2003-04. It then in-,149
NA,creased the co-contribution from $1 to $1.50,149
NA,in 2004-05 and raised the upper income,149
NA,"threshold from $40,000 to $58,000. From 1",149
NA,"July 2007, eligibility for the co-contribution",149
NA,scheme will be extended to the self-,149
NA,"employed, and the income thresholds will be",149
NA,indexed each year in line with growth in,149
NA,wages. Over 2.7 million co-contribution,149
NA,payments worth approximately $2 billion,149
NA,have already been paid under the scheme.,149
NA,This measure will increase payments under,149
NA,this scheme to $3.1 billion.,149
NA,The only way that this government has,149
NA,been able to afford such a generous scheme,149
NA,to provide support to lowand middle-,149
NA,income earners is because it has run a suc-,149
NA,cessful economy. This policy would never,149
NA,"have been contemplated by the Labor Party,",149
NA,because during their term in government,149
NA,they ran up $96 billion of debt and required,149
NA,$8½ billion a year to service that debt. If a,149
NA,government is servicing $8½ billion in inter-,149
NA,"est payments each year, it could never con-",149
NA,template providing support to lower income,149
NA,earners with this sort of policy.,149
NA,"The co-contribution scheme builds, as I",149
NA,"said earlier, on the superannuation reforms",149
NA,that we announced in the last budget and that,149
NA,we have built on since that time. It will set,149
NA,"up the next generation, those people who",149
NA,will be facing the threats of the ageing of the,149
NA,"population in this nation, and it will provide",149
NA,people with a greater capacity to enjoy a bet-,149
NA,ter lifestyle in retirement. It will provide,149
NA,them with an opportunity also to be sup-,149
NA,"ported by the taxpayer, if they have not saved",149
NA,"enough through their superannuation,",149
NA,through the age pension system. But this is a,149
NA,system which has worked well. It is only,149
NA,affordable because of the good economic,149
NA,management of the Howard government. It,149
NA,only remains affordable whilst the economy,149
NA,"is well managed. The system, like most in",149
NA,"this place, would be under threat if the Labor",149
NA,"Party were to be returned to power, because",149
NA,they do not have the skills to run a trillion-,149
NA,dollar economy.,149
NA,"In closing, can I just provide by way of",149
NA,example two or three electorates where this,149
NA,has provided real outcomes to lowand mid-,149
NA,dle-income earners. I will start with the,149
NA,wonderful electorate of Dickson in the state,149
NA,"of Queensland. In that electorate, there are",149
NA,"9,537 lowand middle-income earners who",149
NA,stand to benefit from this measure-those,149
NA,people who would not otherwise have had an,149
NA,opportunity to accumulate and to compound,149
NA,this money to help them in their retirement.,149
NA,The second one which I think is also relevant,149
NA,as part of today's debate is the electorate of,149
NA,"the member for Griffith, where 9,849 low-",149
NA,and middle-income earners will benefit from,149
NA,the measure. In the electorate of the member,149
NA,"for Lilley, there are 12,154 lowand middle-",149
NA,income earners. It should be the responsibil-,149
NA,ity of the member for Lilley and the member,149
NA,for Griffith to explain to their respective,149
NA,electorates why the Labor Party would have,149
NA,no hope of continuing this policy in govern-,149
NA,ment-because they would again not be in a,149
NA,position economically to afford such a policy,150
NA,to help lowand middle-income earners re-,150
NA,tire more comfortably than they otherwise,150
NA,would be able to. I commend the bill to the,150
NA,House.,150
NA,Question agreed to.,150

NA,Message from the Governor-General rec-,150

NA,PARK AMENDMENT BILL 2007,150
NA,Second Reading,150
NA,Debate resumed.,150
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. IR,150
NA,Causley)-The original question was that,150
NA,this bill be now read a second time. To this,150
NA,the honourable member for Kingsford Smith,150
NA,has moved as an amendment that all words,150
NA,after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substi-,150
NA,tuting other words. The question now is that,150
NA,the words proposed to be omitted stand part,150
NA,of the question.,150
Dr SOUTHCOTT ,Boothby) (6.44,150
NA,pm)-Since the election of the Howard gov-,150
NA,"ernment, protected zones within the Great",150
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park have increased,150
NA,from 4½ per cent of the marine park to one-,150
NA,"third of it, adding almost 5,000 square kilo-",150
NA,metres of protected areas. To do this required,150
NA,"management of all the different stakeholders,",150
NA,considering their points of view and support-,150
NA,ing fishermen and others who rely on the,150
NA,marine area for their income with a compre-,150
NA,hensive and uncapped structural adjustment,150
NA,"package. There is still more to be done, with",150
NA,a reef water quality action plan currently,150
NA,being implemented. In last night's budget,150
NA,speech the Treasurer announced that another,150
NA,$14.2 million over four years from the Natu-,150
NA,ral Heritage Trust would be used to compre-,150
NA,hensively monitor and report on the water,150
NA,quality and ecosystem health of the Great,150
NA,Barrier Reef Lagoon. The aim is to address,150
NA,one of the biggest current threats to reef,150
NA,health-the run-off of sediment and other,150
NA,undesirable nutrients into the reef lagoons.,150
NA,"As I have mentioned, there are many con-",150
NA,siderations that must be made when examin-,150
NA,ing the future of the reef. The Great Barrier,150
NA,Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 2007 has,150
NA,been introduced by the Minister for the Envi-,150
NA,ronment and Water Resources for the pur-,150
NA,pose of amending the Great Barrier Reef,150
NA,Marine Park Act 1975 to include recommen-,150
NA,dations made in the 2006 review of the Great,150
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The au-,150
NA,thority was set up with specific responsibili-,150
NA,ties to protect the marine park while consid-,150
NA,ering the interests that compete for how the,150
NA,"park should be utilised. In particular, a pri-",150
NA,mary function of the authority is to provide,150
NA,recommendations on declaring areas for in-,150
NA,clusion in the marine park and for what uses,150
NA,these should be zoned. It also serves a further,150
NA,purpose in managing and promoting Com-,150
NA,monwealth-state relations and assisting co-,150
NA,operative arrangements for the environ-,150
NA,mental management of the Great Barrier,150
NA,Reef region.,150
NA,Some of the key amendments being intro-,150
NA,duced in this bill will serve to carefully ex-,150
NA,amine the effects of any draft zoning plan,150
NA,through the preparation of a report on the,150
NA,"environmental, economic and social values",150
NA,of the area with which the plan is concerned;,150
NA,increase from one month to three months the,150
NA,minimum amount of time for the acceptance,150
NA,of public comment on draft zoning plans;,150
NA,"and repeal section 37 of the act, in response",150
NA,to one of the recommendations of the 2006,150
NA,review. The proposed amendment to section,151
NA,37 will ensure that any zoning plan cannot be,151
NA,amended for at least seven years and that a,151
NA,report on the progress of the plan must be,151
NA,tabled every five years. This will ensure that,151
NA,"the benefits of zoning accrue, provide a suit-",151
NA,able period for the ecosystem to flourish and,151
NA,give certainty to businesses to adapt to the,151
NA,requirements.,151
NA,But the government is also aware that,151
NA,maintaining and protecting the environment,151
NA,is not just a local issue. The effect that coral tage.,151
NA,bleaching disease is having on some of the,151
NA,healthiest reefs within the marine park has,151
NA,long been a concern for researchers. Just yes-,151
NA,"terday, researchers suggested that rising",151
NA,ocean temperatures may be a driver of dis-,151
NA,ease outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef.,151
NA,This highlights the need for broad thinking-,151
NA,the need to think globally in order to address,151
NA,"a national concern. As a nation, Australia",151
NA,contributes only 1.46 per cent of global,151
NA,greenhouse gas emissions. While there is,151
NA,much that can be done to cut our contribu-,151
NA,"tion, we will achieve far more through coop-",151
NA,erative projects with other nations in our re-,151
NA,gion. One example is the Asia-Pacific part-,151
NA,nership for clean technology and develop-,151
NA,ment. Another solution is the Global Initia-,151
NA,tive on Forests and Climate. The government,151
NA,will provide almost $200 million to look at,151
NA,reforestation in South-East Asia. This is an,151
NA,initiative that Australia is leading. The How-,151
NA,ard government recognises that greenhouse,151
NA,gas emissions and climate change are serious,151
NA,issues which require a whole range of practi-,151
NA,cal responses and cannot be properly ad-,151
NA,dressed without the cooperation of our,151
NA,neighbours.,151
NA,This government has invested billions of,151
NA,dollars in environmental programs and re-,151
NA,"search, and the evidence shows that this is a",151
NA,sound investment in our nation's future. By,151
NA,2010 the greenhouse gas emissions from de-,151
NA,forestation will be 45 per cent of their 1990,151
NA,"levels. Further, since 1990 more than 1.1",151
NA,million hectares of new forests have been,151
NA,"planted, with the expected result being that",151
NA,21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide will be,151
NA,removed from the atmosphere each year by,151
NA,"2010. Over the last 10 years, $2 billion has",151
NA,been spent to combat climate change. This,151
NA,"will see Australia being able to meet or, in",151
NA,"fact, better the greenhouse targets set out in",151
NA,"the Kyoto protocol, as recently outlined by",151
NA,the Minister for the Environment and Heri-,151
NA,Much has been made over this govern-,151
NA,"ment's decision not to ratify Kyoto, but our",151
NA,long-held view that climate change must be,151
NA,treated as a global challenge incorporating,151
NA,the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters,151
NA,has been supported by the findings of the,151
NA,latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel,151
NA,"on Climate Change, which was released last",151
NA,Friday. The government understands the,151
NA,need to find a balance between environ-,151
NA,mental management and economic concerns.,151
NA,We have demonstrated this with our course,151
NA,of action to deal with climate change and,151
NA,with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,151
NA,Amendment Bill 2007. We have sought to,151
NA,implement changes recommended by the,151
NA,2006 review and to ensure the responsible,151
NA,management and conservation of one of the,151
NA,world's greatest marine parks.,151
NA,The Great Barrier Reef is an Australian,151
NA,icon. It was listed as a World Heritage Area,151
NA,by the Fraser government in 1981. It con-,151
NA,tributes something like $5 billion to the tour-,151
NA,ism industry and it is a resource for all Aus-,151
NA,tralians. I commend the bill to the House.,151
Mr ALBANESE ,Grayndler) (6.50 pm)-,151
NA,I rise to speak on the Great Barrier Reef Ma-,151
NA,rine Park Amendment Bill 2007. Members of,151
NA,the House would know that I have a long-,151
NA,held interest in the protection and conserva-,151
NA,tion of the Great Barrier Reef-a true Aus-,151
NA,tralian treasure and icon. It is this interest,151
NA,that drives me to make one critical point: no,152
NA,number of amendments to legislation that,152
NA,impacts on the Great Barrier Reef will save,152
NA,this national treasure without immediate ac-,152
NA,tion by the federal government on climate,152
NA,"change. While we have inaction, there will",152
NA,be no saving the Great Barrier Reef. There is,152
NA,ample evidence to show that rising global,152
NA,water temperatures are increasing the inci-,152
NA,dence of bleaching events and coral diseases.,152
NA,The IPCC was clear in its conclusion that,152
NA,rising temperatures are linked to greenhouse,152
NA,gases being pumped into the atmosphere by,152
NA,human activity. In its Fourth Assessment,152
NA,"Report, released in April, the IPCC stated:",152
NA,Significant loss of biodiversity is projected to,152
NA,"occur by 2020 in some ecologically-rich sites,",152
NA,including the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland,152

NA,If we do not significantly reduce our green-,152
NA,"house output, we could see the complete col-",152
NA,lapse of the reef in our lifetime. The evi-,152
NA,dence is abundant but so are the Howard,152
NA,government climate change sceptics and cli-,152
NA,mate change apologists. We have just heard,152
NA,"from one, who stated that Australia was on",152
NA,track to meet our Kyoto protocol target.,152
NA,"Firstly, it is unlikely that Australia will meet",152
NA,"our generous target. Secondly, the people",152
NA,who say that never acknowledge that in fact,152
NA,Australia is one of only three countries,152
NA,throughout the world that were given a gen-,152
NA,"erous figure, increasing their greenhouse gas",152
NA,emissions based on 1990 levels. If you take,152
NA,away the decisions by the Queensland and,152
NA,New South Wales governments to end broad-,152
NA,"scale land clearing, you see our greenhouse",152
NA,"gas emissions have spiralled, increasing by",152
NA,over 20 per cent since 1990. Our greenhouse,152
NA,"gas emissions are on track, according to the",152
NA,"government's own figures, to increase sub-",152
NA,stantially up to the year 2020. The govern-,152
NA,ment conveniently ignores the fact that it,152
NA,signed the Kyoto protocol because it had,152
NA,such a generous target and said that it would,152
NA,"be, to quote the Prime Minister, ‘a win for",152
NA,the environment and a win for Australian,152
NA,jobs'.,152
NA,Australia only retreated from that posi-,152
NA,tion-and joined with the United States in,152
NA,isolating ourselves from global action-after,152
NA,the United States made that decision. By,152
NA,"Australia being outside of the global system,",152
NA,we do not have a say at the table in the post-,152
NA,2012 system. I have attended the last two UN,152
NA,framework convention conferences which,152
NA,have been held in conjunction with the first,152
NA,and seventh international conferences of the,152
NA,"parties to the Kyoto protocol, in Montreal",152
NA,and Nairobi. At those conferences Australia,152
NA,does not get a say in the very significant,152
NA,meetings taking place regarding the structure,152
NA,and scope of the second commitment period,152
NA,of the Kyoto protocol for post-2012. That is,152
NA,going to be a critical agreement as to,152
NA,whether the world can agree that we need to,152
NA,reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as in-,152
NA,"dividuals, as communities, as nations and as",152
NA,a global community. The structure which,152
NA,drives that change is the Kyoto protocol. The,152
NA,embarrassing performances by the Minister,152
NA,for the Environment and Water Resources in,152
NA,describing Australia as a global leader is ex-,152
NA,"traordinary, to say the least, and offensive to",152
NA,"many, because the evidence that we need to",152
NA,take action is there. The evidence is also,152
NA,there that it is not a case of whether you put,152
NA,the environment or the economy first. It is,152
NA,the case that in order to sustain our economic,152
NA,prosperity we must have a sustainable envi-,152
NA,ronment and we must take action on climate,152
NA,change.,152
NA,Just this week further research conducted,153
NA,by an international team of scientists-from,153
NA,"the University of North Carolina, the Austra-",153
NA,lian Research Council Centre of Excellence,153
NA,"for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook Univer-",153
NA,sity and the Australian Institute of Marine,153
NA,Science-who are working on Australia's,153
NA,Great Barrier Reef has revealed a ‘highly,153
NA,"significant relationship', to quote their",153
NA,"port, between coral disease and warmer",153
NA,ocean temperatures. The researchers state,153
NA,their results suggest that climate change,153
NA,could be increasing the severity,153
NA,"the ocean, leading to a decline in the health",153
NA,of marine ecosystems and the loss of the re-,153
NA,sources and services that humans derive,153
NA,from them. The Great Barrier Reef is esti-,153
NA,"mated to contribute $5.4 billion and 68,000",153
NA,local jobs to the Australian economy.,153
NA,"Worldwide, coral reefs support more than",153
NA,200 million people. The evidence is over-,153
NA,"whelming, yet the federal government's re-",153
NA,sponse is underwhelming. For more than 11,153
NA,long years the Howard government has been,153
NA,complacent and has comfortably sat back,153
NA,and watched while the Great Barrier Reef,153
NA,has been threatened. It has done that because,153
NA,of an ideological view that is based upon,153
NA,scepticism as to whether climate change is,153
NA,indeed human induced.,153
NA,Consider the best-case scenario which has,153
NA,been outlined in many reports. In February,153
NA,"2006, the CSIRO report Climate change im-",153
NA,pacts on Australia and the benefits of early,153
NA,action to reduce global greenhouse gas emis-,153
NA,"sions highlighted that, even if all greenhouse",153
NA,"gas emissions ceased today, the earth would",153
NA,still be committed to an additional warming,153
NA,of between 0.2 and one degree Celsius by the,153
NA,end of the century. The current momentum of,153
NA,the world's fossil fuel economy precludes the,153
NA,elimination of greenhouse gas emissions,153
NA,over the near term. So it is clear that future,153
NA,global warming is likely to be well over one,153
NA,"degree Celsius. Left unchecked, human",153
NA,greenhouse gas emissions will increase sev-,153
NA,eral-fold over the 21st century. The CSIRO,153
NA,report states that Australia's annual average,153
NA,temperatures are projected to increase by,153
NA,between 0.4 and two degrees Celsius above,153
NA,1990 levels by the year 2030 and by between,153
NA,one degree and six degrees Celsius by 2070.,153
NA,"However, if we limit future increases in at-",153
NA,"re- mospheric CO2 to 550 parts per million, we",153
NA,would reduce 21st century global warming to,153
NA,an estimated 1.5 to 2.9 degrees Celsius. This,153
NA,would effectively avoid the more extreme,153
NA,of disease in climate changes.,153
NA,It is widely accepted that a target of a 60,153
NA,per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emis-,153
NA,sions by 2050 is required to stabilise CO2,153
NA,emissions to 550 parts per million. In Austra-,153
NA,lia we have a government that refuses to en-,153
NA,gage in discussion about greenhouse gas,153
NA,emissions targets. What does this scepticism,153
NA,mean for the Great Barrier Reef? Even in a,153
NA,best-case scenario that we can limit CO2 to,153
NA,"550 parts per million, the consequences are",153
NA,devastating. A less than one degree Celsius,153
NA,rise in temperature would mean that 60 per,153
NA,cent of the Great Barrier Reef could be regu-,153
NA,larly bleached. A one-degree or two-degrees,153
NA,temperature rise would mean 58 to 81 per,153
NA,cent of the Great Barrier Reef is bleached,153
NA,every year and a twoto three-degrees tem-,153
NA,perature rise would mean that 97 per cent of,153
NA,the Great Barrier Reef would be bleached,153
NA,every year. We need a plan to address these,153
NA,"issues, we need targets for greenhouse gas",153
NA,emission reductions and we need the eco-,153
NA,nomic instruments that would drive the move,153
NA,"to clean energy, which is why we need a na-",153
NA,tional emissions trading scheme. We need,153
NA,bold energy initiatives such as those pro-,153
NA,"posed by Labor's solar, green energy and",153
NA,water renovations plan for Australian house-,153
NA,holds that will save families money on their,153
NA,energy and water bills and help the environ-,153
NA,ment. We need to ratify the Kyoto protocol.,153
NA,We need a substantial increase in our manda-,154
NA,tory renewable energy target.,154
NA,"Unfortunately, climate change is not the",154
NA,only threat to the health and long-term sur-,154
NA,vival of the Great Barrier Reef. It is difficult,154
NA,to believe that oil drilling and exploration,154
NA,can still occur on or near the reef. I have in-,154
NA,troduced a private member's bill that is still,154
NA,on the Notice Paper that would stop this oc-,154
NA,curring. My colleague the member for,154
NA,Kingsford Smith has moved an amendment,154
NA,seeking support for the Great Barrier Reef,154
NA,Marine Park (Protecting the Great Barrier,154
NA,Reef from Oil Drilling and Exploration),154
NA,Amendment Bill. It was 1983 when the,154
NA,Hawke Labor government acted to prohibit,154
NA,drilling anywhere in the Great Barrier Reef,154
NA,region by extending the borders of that re-,154
NA,gion east to Australia's exclusive economic,154
NA,zone. Our legislation would remove the,154
NA,threat posed by exploration and mining both,154
NA,on and near the reef. The Howard govern-,154
NA,ment has never ruled out oil drilling east of,154
NA,"the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the very",154
NA,area our bill seeks to protect. If the Howard,154
NA,government is serious about protecting the,154
NA,"reef, it will support the passage of Labor's",154
NA,bill through the parliament. This bill would,154
NA,protect not only the reef's extraordinarily,154
NA,diverse ecosystem but also the livelihoods of,154
NA,"200,000 Queenslanders and a tourism indus-",154
NA,try worth billions of dollars annually.,154
NA,Rather than take practical and long-term,154
NA,"action against climate change, the Howard",154
NA,government entertains absurd ideas to protect,154
NA,the Great Barrier Reef. In the collection of,154
NA,"absurd ideas, perhaps the worst was the plan",154
NA,of the Minister for Small Business and Tour-,154
NA,ism to put a shadecloth over the Great Bar-,154
NA,rier Reef-a bizarre and impractical proposi-,154
NA,tion from a government looking for political,154
NA,cover to hide the fact that it has no plan to,154
NA,tackle climate change. We need to reduce our,154
NA,"greenhouse pollution, not publicly brain-",154
NA,"storm absurd ideas. The minister, Fran Bai-",154
NA,"ley, was topped on this proposal by the",154
NA,member for Tangney who wants to put a,154
NA,shadecloth in outer space to combat global,154
NA,"warming. Dr Jensen, the member for Tang-",154
NA,"ney, said in the Commonwealth of Australia",154
NA,parliament:,154
NA,"After all, we have heard about aerosols and global",154
NA,dimming. Or what about some sort of shadecloth,154
NA,put in orbit? In that way we could actually tailor,154
NA,the area of the shadecloth and adjust it according,154
NA,to the energy balance.,154
NA,A completely whacky proposal from a gov-,154
NA,ernment member who is one of the people,154
NA,always put up to debate climate change in,154
NA,this House. One of the government's key,154
NA,climate change experts is the member for,154
NA,"Tangney, who supports putting a shadecloth",154
NA,into orbit along with putting nuclear reactors,154
NA,all around the coast of Australia-an abso-,154
NA,lutely extraordinary proposal. Whilst the,154
NA,"member for Tangney calls himself a scientist,",154
NA,the plan for a giant intergalactic shadecloth,154
NA,in outer space does not constitute serious,154
NA,scientific discussion on climate change.,154
NA,When you look at the government's spokes-,154
NA,people-the member for Tangney with his,154
NA,outer space shadecloth; the minister for tour-,154
NA,"ism, a frontbencher, with her plan for a",154
NA,shadecloth to protect the Great Barrier Reef;,154
NA,and a Prime Minister who does not think that,154
NA,climate change exists and is sceptical but still,154
NA,wants to impose 25 nuclear reactors on the,154
NA,coastal areas and urban communities of Aus-,154
NA,tralia-it is little wonder that you see this,154
NA,government has no credibility when it comes,154
NA,to climate change.,154
NA,It keeps going right to the top of this gov-,154
NA,"ernment, because a couple of weeks ago the",154
NA,"Prime Minister opened-well, he did not",154
NA,quite open it because it has been shut,154
NA,down-the new Lucas Heights reactor in,154
NA,Sydney. They went ahead with the grand,154
NA,"opening anyway, because the Prime Minister",154
NA,wanted to promote and use what is a medical,154
NA,research facility that has broad support to,154
NA,promote his narrow agenda on nuclear reac-,155
NA,"tors. There, at the opening, the Prime Minis-",155
NA,ter said that the Lucas Heights reactor was,155
NA,"‘Australian icon'-an icon, along with the",155
NA,Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. This,155
NA,"was the third Sydney icon-not the Rocks,",155
NA,"not the Blue Mountains, not Bondi Beach",155
NA,"and the pavilion, not Balmoral, not Taronga",155
NA,"Park Zoo, not all these great Sydney icons;",155
NA,"this was the icon. Well, I say to the Prime",155
NA,"Minister: ‘We do have an icon, in Far North",155
NA,"Queensland, and that is the Great Barrier",155
NA,"Reef'-the largest, most pristine, continuous",155
NA,coral reef archipelago on earth; our treasured,155
NA,"natural icon, which is some 18 million years",155
NA,old. And it is astonishing that the govern-,155
NA,ment still has not placed the Great Barrier,155
NA,Reef on Australia's National Heritage List.,155
NA,The Prime Minister's scepticism is getting in,155
NA,the way of good policy.,155
NA,I conclude with this point: we do need to,155
NA,protect the Great Barrier Reef. I want future,155
NA,generations to have the opportunity that I,155
NA,have had to see this marvellous natural won-,155
NA,der. I also want the economic benefit that,155
NA,"comes through jobs, and income to Australia,",155
NA,as a result of the Great Barrier Reef's pres-,155
NA,ence. But unless we have action on climate,155
NA,change we will not be able to save the Great,155
NA,Barrier Reef. That is a practical demonstra-,155
NA,tion of why we need to move away from this,155
NA,government's scepticism and have a gov-,155
NA,"ernment, one led by Kevin Rudd, which ac-",155
NA,tually understands that climate change is a,155
NA,"great challenge for our generation, and is",155
NA,prepared to do something about it-is pre-,155
NA,pared to take the action that is required.,155
Mr MURPHY ,Lowe) (7.09 pm)-The,155
NA,"Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975,",155
NA,which the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,155
NA,"Amendment Bill 2007 amends, has served its",155
NA,"purpose extremely well, and remains a fun-",155
NA,damentally sound piece of legislation. At the,155
NA,"time of its enactment, the government of the",155
NA,"day stated, ‘The protection of our unique",155
NA,barrier reef is of paramount importance to,155
NA,Australia and to the world.' Like any other,155
NA,"an good piece of legislation, the Great Barrier",155
NA,"Reef Marine Park Act 1975 has, over time,",155
NA,been successful at giving effect to the public,155
NA,policy considerations underpinning it. We,155
NA,need not look any further for evidence of this,155
NA,than the many achievements of the Great,155
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the,155
NA,"international recognition, in 1981, of the",155
NA,conservation value of the Great Barrier Reef,155
NA,following its inscription on the World Heri-,155
NA,tage List.,155
NA,There can be no doubt that the act has,155
NA,stood the test of time as an exemplary de-,155
NA,fender of marine management and conserva-,155
NA,"tion. Nonetheless, the act has now been in",155
NA,place for over 30 years and many lessons,155
NA,have been learnt from the challenges of the,155
NA,past. The manifest integrity of the act-and,155
NA,the general acceptance of that integrity by,155
NA,the stakeholders which it serves-is essential,155
NA,if the act is to have any hope of safeguarding,155
NA,the interests of the Great Barrier Reef well,155
NA,into the future.,155
NA,The report of the review of the Great Bar-,155
NA,rier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 identified,155
NA,numerous concerns about the inadequacy of,155
NA,the processes in place for engaging with,155
NA,stakeholders-as well as concern that deci-,155
NA,sions under the act were not being conveyed,155
NA,clearly enough to those stakeholders. The,155
NA,introduction of the Great Barrier Reef Ma-,155
NA,"rine Park Zoning Plan 2003, with its consid-",155
NA,"erable scale and scope, affected many com-",155
NA,munities and stakeholders. Perhaps better,155
NA,"than any other chapter in the act's history,",155
NA,this example demonstrated the tension often,155
NA,felt by many stakeholders in the decision-,155
NA,making process. Whether for valid reasons or,155
NA,"otherwise, many stakeholders disagreed with",155
NA,"the scientific basis of the zoning plan, con-",155
NA,sidered the processes to be biased and felt,155
NA,that it failed to consider the impacts on indi-,155
NA,viduals and communities.,155
NA,While the final criticism ought to be lev-,156
NA,elled directly at the Howard government for,156
NA,ignoring repeated warnings from the Queen-,156
NA,sland fishing industry about flaws in socio-,156
NA,"economic assessment processes, the other",156
NA,criticisms are symptomatic of the inherent,156
NA,weaknesses in the act. The review panel ex-,156
NA,ecutive summary recognised this when it,156
NA,noted that:,156
NA,... an effective relationship with recreational,156
NA,commercial fishing stakeholders is lacking. To an,156
NA,"extent, such tensions between the Authority and",156
NA,affected stakeholders were inevitable in view of,156
NA,the substantial change to zoning arrangements,156
NA,proposed.,156
NA,And said:,156
NA,... the Review Panel is of the view that,156
NA,esses for engagement with all stakeholders can be,156
NA,improved.,156
NA,The processes involved in the 2003 zoning,156
NA,plan should be considered with a view to,156
NA,learning lessons for the future. Managing the,156
NA,"alternative uses of the marine park, and re-",156
NA,sponding to the long-term protection needs,156
NA,of the future will become much more chal-,156
NA,lenging in the future.,156
NA,The integrity of the act and the integrity of,156
NA,processes that allow conservation to coexist,156
NA,with reasonable marine park use-and the,156
NA,general acceptance of that integrity by stake-,156
NA,holders-depends on practices that: are,156
NA,"clearly scientific, are thoroughly transparent,",156
NA,"engage with stakeholders, are clearly under-",156
NA,"stood, and assess the social and economic",156
NA,impacts of any changes affecting the Great,156
NA,Barrier Reef. That is why I welcomed a re-,156
NA,view into the act to:,156
NA,... improve the performance of the Great Barrier,156
NA,"Reef Marine Park Authority, its office holders and",156
NA,its accountability frameworks.,156
NA,It is also the reason why I am generally sup-,156
NA,portive of the measures in this bill.,156
NA,While the bill is by no means perfect-,156
NA,and I will come to that later-it is certainly,156
NA,not as bad as many of us had feared at the,156
NA,time of the review's announcement by the,156
NA,former Minister for the Environment and,156
NA,Heritage. The review into the Great Barrier,156
NA,Reef Marine Park Act came against a back-,156
NA,drop of a National Party push to abolish the,156
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority,156
NA,and give full control to the minister. No,156
NA,doubt the abolition of the authority has only,156
NA,and been avoided because of the intense cam-,156
NA,paign from members on this side of the,156
NA,chamber and the resulting public outrage.,156
NA,The review also came against a backdrop of,156
NA,the Howard government gutting the inde-,156
NA,pendence of other key environmental agen-,156
NA,cies such as the Australian Greenhouse Of-,156
NA,the proc- fice-have we forgotten?-the National,156
NA,Oceans Office and the Australian Heritage,156
NA,Commission.,156
NA,The review also came against the back-,156
NA,drop of the Howard government's use of no-,156
NA,tions such as ‘accountability' and ‘best cor-,156
NA,porate practice' as powerful rhetorical weap-,156
NA,ons but then acting in a venal manner that,156
NA,made a mockery of those very notions. Who,156
NA,could forget the Australian Broadcasting,156
NA,Corporation Amendment Bill 2006? When,156
NA,announcing plans to restructure the board of,156
NA,the ABC under the guise of implementing the,156
NA,"Uhrig report, the Review of corporate gov-",156
NA,ernance of statutory authorities and office,156
NA,"holders, many held hopes of genuine reform.",156
NA,Many held hopes of a restructure that would,156
NA,result in an open and transparent process for,156
NA,"making appointments to the ABC board, ap-",156
NA,pointments based on merit and free of politi-,156
NA,cal patronage. We all know how wrong we,156
NA,"were, and we will rectify that on the election",156
NA,of a Rudd Labor government.,156
NA,These are not trifling matters that can be,156
NA,dismissed when considering the substance of,156
NA,the bill before us today. The backdrop I have,156
NA,just provided is most relevant to several mat-,156
NA,ters of concern in the Great Barrier Reef Ma-,156
NA,rine Park Amendment Bill 2007. As I have,156
NA,"mentioned, it is true that there are many",157
NA,sons we can learn from the execution of the,157
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act over the,157
NA,"last 30 years. However, it is true that there",157
NA,are still many lessons we can learn from the,157
NA,Howard government's approach over the last,157
NA,10 years to so-called improvements in ac-,157
NA,countability and performance frameworks of,157
NA,statutory authorities.,157
NA,"At face value, the bill does fulfil the",157
NA,jectives the member for Wentworth has set,157
NA,"out. At face value, the bill strengthens gov-",157
NA,"ernance arrangements, transparency and ac-",157
NA,countability. This is particularly so for the,157
NA,zoning plan processes. There will be far,157
NA,greater engagement with stakeholders in the,157
NA,development of new zoning plans which,157
NA,regulate the use of the marine park. A system,157
NA,will be in place which better balances and,157
NA,manages the diverse and competing interests,157
NA,involved in any proposed zoning plan.,157
NA,Amendments to section 32 of the act will,157
NA,increase the minimum public comment pe-,157
NA,riod for draft zone plans from one month to,157
NA,three months. Proposed sections 34 and 35,157
NA,will make the zone planning process more,157
NA,"transparent, with comprehensive information",157
NA,being made available to stakeholders. The,157
NA,process will be built on principles that must,157
NA,consider robust scientific and socioeconomic,157
NA,"information. These principles, and a report",157
NA,"considering the environmental, economic",157
NA,"and social values of an area, must be made",157
NA,"available to communities, users of the marine",157
NA,park and other interested persons and organi-,157
NA,sations. It is pleasing to see that a compre-,157
NA,hensive socioeconomic assessment is neces-,157
NA,sary prior to making any changes to zoning.,157
NA,The disinterest and indolence shown by,157
NA,the Howard government to repeated warn-,157
NA,ings from the Queensland fishing industry,157
NA,that inadequate attention had been provided,157
NA,to the social and economic impacts of zoning,157
NA,plans is staggering. Perhaps this is being,157
NA,lesgenerous. Some would say the attention paid,157
NA,was perfunctory. The initial failure to con-,157
NA,sider the social and economic implications of,157
NA,zoning plans for the commercial fishing in-,157
NA,"dustry is, at best, regrettable. However, the",157
NA,Howard government's need to review and,157
NA,upgrade its fishing industry structural ad-,157
NA,justment packages on four separate occasions,157
NA,was embarrassing and a sign of incompe-,157
NA,obtence. It has been the cause of much frustra-,157
NA,"tion for stakeholders, and it has unfairly sub-",157
NA,jected the integrity of the act itself to unnec-,157
NA,"essary scrutiny. For the government's sake,",157
NA,we all hope this embarrassment can be,157
NA,avoided in future as a result of the amend-,157
NA,"ments contained in this bill, although there",157
NA,can be no panacea for incompetence.,157
NA,Proposed sections 53 and 54 will establish,157
NA,a periodic Great Barrier Reef outlook report,157
NA,that provides a regular and reliable means of,157
NA,assessing performance in the long-term pro-,157
NA,tection of the Great Barrier Reef. The peer,157
NA,review assessment will include an analysis of,157
NA,the condition of the ecosystem and the long-,157
NA,term outlook for the reef. The outlook report,157
NA,may be used during any review of a zoning,157
NA,plan which is currently in place. So as to al-,157
NA,low the consequences of an existing zoning,157
NA,"plan to take full effect on the ecosystem,",157
NA,amendments to or reviews of zoning plans,157
NA,may only take place after seven years.,157
NA,The requirement that significant amend-,157
NA,ments may only be made to zoning plans,157
NA,after seven years leads me to a concern that,157
NA,pressing issues which may be identified in an,157
NA,"outlook report, which is prepared every five",157
NA,"years, may not be acted upon for a further",157
NA,two years. Notwithstanding this minor con-,157
NA,"cern, there can be no doubt that the amend-",157
NA,ments have ostensibly been drafted for a,157
NA,"proper purpose. At face value, the amend-",157
NA,ments improve transparency and account-,157
NA,ability and strengthen the governance of the,157
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.,157
NA,This is in no small part because the health,158
NA,of the Great Barrier Reef is to be regularly,158
NA,"reported on, and considerations of changes in",158
NA,future planning and zoning arrangements,158
NA,will appear to be undertaken in a robust and,158
NA,"transparent manner. However, as with any",158
NA,reform of a statutory authority by the How-,158
NA,"ard government, it would be prudent to",158
NA,scratch the surface of the proposals because,158
NA,the devil is often in the detail. Superficiality,158
NA,has always been a strength of the govern-,158
NA,"ment, but it is often the motives behind its",158
NA,proposals that can leave a lot to be desired.,158
NA,This bill is no exception.,158
NA,While I would not be prepared to throw,158
NA,"the baby out with the bathwater, there are",158
NA,elements of this bill which all members,158
NA,should have serious concerns about. The,158
NA,"Great Barrier Reef advisory board, which",158
NA,will be structured to provide the Minister for,158
NA,the Environment and Water Resources with,158
NA,specific advice relating to marine park pro-,158
NA,"tection and use, will comprise appointments",158
NA,hand-picked by the minister.,158
NA,"Outlook reports, which will be structured",158
NA,to regularly provide the minister and the pub-,158
NA,lic with information about the health of the,158
NA,"Great Barrier Reef, will be drafted by an au-",158
NA,thority whose members have been appointed,158
NA,by the minister. The outlook report will be,158
NA,peer-reviewed by persons who the minister,158
NA,thinks have the necessary qualifications to,158
NA,undertake the task.,158
NA,The bill does not give any indication as to,158
NA,whether the bona fides or qualifications of,158
NA,those undertaking the peer review of an out-,158
NA,look report will be subjected to public scru-,158
NA,"tiny, because there is no indication as to",158
NA,whether the peer review itself is public or,158
NA,confidential. The principles upon which a,158
NA,"zoning plan is based are, in the final analysis,",158
NA,"approved by the minister alone. Furthermore,",158
NA,any decision to amend a zoning plan will rest,158
NA,not with the authority but with the minister.,158
NA,The minister may retort that any decision to,158
NA,amend a zoning plan will be based on the,158
NA,outlook report and advice received by the,158
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.,158
NA,"However, we cannot easily forget the",158
NA,"backdrop to this bill, which I identified ear-",158
NA,lier. The Howard government has drafted this,158
NA,bill against a backdrop of government mem-,158
NA,bers seeking to abolish the Great Barrier,158
NA,"Reef Marine Park Authority, against a back-",158
NA,drop of damaging the independence of other,158
NA,key environmental agencies and against a,158
NA,backdrop of using rhetorical weapons of re-,158
NA,form and restructure to make political ap-,158
NA,pointments to statutory authorities.,158
NA,Under the present government there has,158
NA,been an appalling tradition of politicising,158
NA,board appointments and elements of the bu-,158
NA,reaucracy. Who could forget the frank and,158
NA,fearless advice received by the government,158
NA,"on such matters as ‘children overboard',",158
NA,‘weapons of mass destruction' and ‘AWB,158
NA,kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime'?,158
NA,"In the best spirit of Christian charity, if",158
NA,one accepts that the government has not lied,158
NA,about these appalling incidents then one can-,158
NA,not forgive the government for its incompe-,158
NA,tence on those matters. It is clear the Howard,158
NA,government does not tolerate criticism well.,158
NA,It is a tragedy that many agencies and de-,158
NA,partments have become shells of their former,158
NA,selves because some members of the gov-,158
NA,ernment do not want to hear of any evil or,158
NA,see any evil-even if the agency knows the,158
NA,evil exists. This backdrop should not allow,158
NA,us to fall for the government's disingenuous,158
NA,attempt to employ shallow words to give,158
NA,soothing assurances that there are the neces-,158
NA,sary checks and balances on the minister's,158
NA,powers under this act.,158
NA,The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Au-,158
NA,"thority, as I have already mentioned, will be",158
NA,comprised of members stacked by the minis-,158
NA,ter. The outlook report will in turn be drafted,158
NA,by this authority. The outlook report will be,159
NA,peer-reviewed by individuals stacked by the,159
NA,minister. Zoning plans will be amended by,159
NA,the minister. Zoning plan principles will be,159
NA,determined by the minister. Members of the,159
NA,Great Barrier Reef advisory board will be,159
NA,stacked by the minister. Members of the,159
NA,government should not feign surprise at the,159
NA,concentration of power in the hands of the,159
NA,minister and nor should members of the gov-,159
NA,ernment feign surprise that one of the few,159
NA,structures in place that could have provided a,159
NA,check on the minister's powers will be abol-,159
NA,ished by this bill. The bill no longer provides,159
NA,for automatic representation on the Great,159
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority from the,159
NA,Queensland government.,159
NA,The minister has already noted that the,159
NA,bill encompasses the outcomes of the 2003,159
NA,"Uhrig report, the Review of the corporate",159
NA,governance of statutory authorities and of-,159
NA,fice holders. In defence of the abolition of,159
NA,Queensland government representation on,159
NA,the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Author-,159
NA,"ity, the minister may cite the following con-",159
NA,clusion from that report:,159
NA,The review does not support representational,159
NA,appointments to governing boards as representa-,159
NA,tional appointments can fail to produce independgiven,159
NA,ent and objective views.,159
NA,"However, assuming Mr Uhrig's conclusions",159
NA,"are correct, it is interesting to note that his",159
NA,findings on the matter only made up one,159
NA,page of a 133-page report. It is important to,159
NA,note that Mr Uhrig also made the comment,159
NA,that ‘there are no universally accepted struc-,159
NA,tures and practices that constitute good gov-,159
NA,ernance'.,159
NA,The choice of governance model for the,159
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority,159
NA,should not be formulaic but should be driven,159
NA,by the objectives of the authority. Guidance,159
NA,can be taken on this point from the executive,159
NA,summary of the Review of the Great Barrier,159
NA,"Reef Marine Park Act. It notes, inter alia, and",159
NA,I quote:,159
NA,... many points of intersection in both policy and,159
NA,legislation that apply to the Marine Park and sur-,159
NA,"rounding area, which require the two govern-",159
NA,ments to work closely together.,159
NA,The review continues:,159
NA,... officeholders should not be representational,159
NA,"but appointed for their relevant expertise, with",159
NA,one member being nominated by the Queensland,159
NA,Government ...,159
NA,In light of the need for effective collabora-,159
NA,tion between the Commonwealth and Queen-,159
NA,"sland governments, this bill ought to have",159
NA,allowed for the Queensland government to,159
NA,be automatically represented on the Great,159
NA,Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I would,159
NA,have thought that that would be the mini-,159
NA,"mum requirement. This, to some degree at",159
NA,"least, would also have installed an independ-",159
NA,ent voice on the authority which could keep,159
NA,a check on the minister's sweeping powers.,159
NA,"Given the health of the Great Barrier Reef,",159
NA,"and bearing in mind that it is at a crossroads,",159
NA,it is more vital now than ever before for the,159
NA,Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to,159
NA,"provide frank, fearless and independent ad-",159
NA,vice to the minister. This is particularly so,159
NA,the minister's propensity to dismiss,159
NA,environmental advice which is extremely,159
NA,pertinent for the long-term survival of the,159
NA,Great Barrier Reef.,159
NA,The issue of climate change is the largest,159
NA,single challenge confronting the Great Bar-,159
NA,rier Reef. Despite overwhelming evidence to,159
NA,"this effect, the government remains unre-",159
NA,pentant in its determination to sabotage ef-,159
NA,forts to reduce emissions. Reports that the,159
NA,Great Barrier Reef is facing extinction be-,159
NA,cause of the effects of climate change have,159
NA,amounted to nothing. It is a disgrace that the,159
NA,government has ignored UN reports which,159
NA,predict the beginning of the end of the Great,159
NA,Barrier Reef within 13 years. Members of,159
NA,the public are entitled to ask: why has the,159
NA,Howard government ignored assessments by,160
NA,the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-,160
NA,mate Change? Why has it ignored Professor,160
NA,Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of the Australian Re-,160
NA,search Council Centre of Excellence for,160
NA,Coral Reef Studies? Why has it ignored Aus-,160
NA,tralian climate change expert Dr Geoff Love?,160
NA,And why has it ignored warnings from Sir,160
NA,Nicholas Stern?,160
NA,While the oceans have been a convenient,160
NA,"dumping ground for our waste, the effect of",160
NA,all of this carbon dioxide upon the ocean,160
NA,waters is beginning to have serious conse-,160
NA,"quences, because carbon dioxide when dis-",160
NA,solved in water forms a weak acid. The Great,160
NA,Barrier Reef is not only under threat from,160
NA,increasing water temperatures that cause,160
NA,"coral bleaching but also, it now appears, be-",160
NA,sieged by increasing ocean acidity. It is,160
NA,breathtakingly hypocritical for the minister,160
NA,to suggest that ‘the Australian government,160
NA,has remained committed to the long-term,160
NA,protection of the Great Barrier Reef' when,160
NA,the government will not seriously address,160
NA,concerns that a three-degree rise in tempera-,160
NA,ture could bleach 97 per cent of the Great,160
NA,Barrier Reef and that coral reef communities,160
NA,will be replaced by algal communities by,160
NA,2030. The government has now cynically,160
NA,"announced, four months before an election,",160
NA,initiatives which will placate the growing,160
NA,anger of Australians. But we know what,160
NA,members of the Howard government really,160
NA,think about the threat of climate change.,160
NA,They are climate change sceptics. They have,160
NA,thrown the precautionary principle out the,160
NA,window. Some members opposite believe-,160
NA,indeed one has openly stated-that climate,160
NA,change is an issue for ‘trendy coffee sippers'.,160
NA,What a disgrace.,160
NA,The government has not only spread mis-,160
NA,information about the consequences of,160
NA,"global warming, particularly for the Great",160
NA,"Barrier Reef, but also deliberately taken a",160
NA,wrecking ball to the international commu-,160
NA,nity's attempts to establish a treaty to reduce,160
NA,the volume of greenhouse gas emissions. It,160
NA,has tried in vain to turn the debate about cli-,160
NA,mate change into a mutually exclusive,160
NA,choice between environmental protection,160
NA,and job protection. This is nonsense. The,160
NA,destruction of the Great Barrier Reef from,160
NA,the effects of climate change directly puts at,160
NA,"risk 200,000 jobs in a $4.3 billion tourism",160
NA,industry. While some members opposite sit,160
NA,back and ridicule scientists from home and,160
NA,"abroad as ‘trendy coffee sippers', the Great",160
NA,Barrier Reef and many tourism jobs are,160
NA,slowly facing destruction as a result of their,160
NA,inaction. This is a scandalous and disgraceful,160
NA,situation. It is vital that the Great Barrier,160
NA,Reef Marine Park Authority be given every,160
NA,opportunity to provide independent advice to,160
NA,"the minister, and it is important that this ad-",160
NA,vice is taken heed of. (Time expired),160
NA,ADJOURNMENT,160
The SPEAKER,Order! It being nearly,160
NA,"7.30 pm, I propose the question:",160
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,160
NA,Productivity,160
Ms GILLARD ,Lalor) (7.29 pm)-Today,160
NA,during question time the Treasurer was asked,160
NA,a question by the shadow Treasurer about the,160
NA,productivity performance of this nation. As,160
NA,"you would no doubt recall, the last thing the",160
NA,Treasurer actually wanted to talk about was,160
NA,the productivity performance of this nation. I,160
NA,can understand why the Treasurer would,160
NA,rather say anything or do anything than an-,160
NA,swer in a straightforward fashion a question,160
NA,"about this nation's productivity because, if he",160
NA,were to answer that question in a straight-,160
NA,"forward fashion, he would have to admit that",160
NA,the productivity record of this country under,160
NA,the Howard government is a track record of,160
NA,failure.,160
NA,"As we know, this government frequently",160
NA,comes into this chamber and makes all sorts,160
NA,of assertions about productivity and about its,160
NA,connection with its extreme industrial rela-,161
NA,tions laws. But what we know from the facts,161
NA,is that productivity under this government is,161
NA,"in deeply concerning territory. Indeed, for",161
NA,the first six months following the com-,161
NA,mencement of this government's extreme,161
NA,"industrial relations laws, productivity in this",161
NA,nation went backwards. It is presently at a,161
NA,staggeringly low 1.5 per cent compared to an,161
NA,"historical average of 2.3 per cent, and the",161
NA,very budget papers the Treasurer launched,161
NA,with such a flourish last night confirm that,161
NA,productivity will plummet again from the,161
NA,end of the next financial year.,161
NA,I can well understand that the Treasurer,161
NA,would rather stand at the dispatch box con-,161
NA,juring up any form of distraction than answer,161
NA,in a straightforward way a question about,161
NA,productivity-because he has no answer. In,161
NA,the course of the Treasurer clutching for dis-,161
NA,"tractions at the dispatch box today, he made",161
NA,the following statement. He was talking,161
NA,about Labor's industrial relations policy. He,161
NA,preferred to talk about that than deal with,161
NA,"productivity issues, and he said in the course",161
NA,of talking about the policy:,161
NA,The people who think that include Sir Rod Ed-,161
NA,"dington, the Labor Party adviser in relation to",161
NA,"industrial relations, the person the Deputy Leader",161
NA,of the Opposition dismissively refers to as ‘an-,161
NA,other voice'-,161
NA,At that stage I responded-and I do apolo-,161
NA,"gise to you, Mr Speaker, for interjecting on",161
NA,"that occasion-by interjecting, ‘Not true!'",161
NA,The Treasurer's statement is not true in two,161
NA,"respects. Firstly, I object to the way in which",161
NA,the Treasurer has described Sir Rod Edding-,161
NA,"ton. Of course, Sir Rod Eddington is a noted",161
NA,member of Australia's business community,161
NA,with a formidable history in Australian busi-,161
NA,ness. He is a former British Airways chief,161
NA,executive who now sits on boards including,161
NA,Rio Tinto and News Corporation. He was,161
NA,appointed by the Labor leader Mr Rudd in,161
NA,February as the chair of Labor's business,161
NA,advisory panel. I believe the way in which,161
NA,the Treasurer described Sir Rod Eddington,161
NA,today was inappropriate in this House. Be-,161
NA,"yond that, the Treasurer today suggested in",161
NA,"his answer, avoiding the question about pro-",161
NA,"ductivity, that I had dismissively referred to",161
NA,Sir Rod Eddington. That is completely un-,161
NA,true. The newspaper article that the Treasurer,161
NA,tabled to try to prove his spurious claims,161
NA,quotes me in the following terms:,161
NA,"Last night, however, Ms Gillard said it would",161
NA,be “very unfair in any way to say I was,161
NA,dismissive” of Sir Rod's contribution to Labor,161
NA,policy.,161
NA,I did object to that; I do object to that. Mr,161
NA,Rod Eddington is an important person in the,161
NA,"business community, he is an important ad-",161
NA,"viser for Labor, I value the discussions I have",161
NA,"had with him, I look forward to more discus-",161
NA,sions with him and I think it is inappropriate,161
NA,that the Treasurer made remarks in those,161
NA,terms in the parliament today.,161
NA,But it is not candour that we expect from,161
NA,the Howard government when we stand in,161
NA,"this parliament. We do not get it, we do not",161
NA,see it on matters like this and we do not see it,161
NA,on matters of public policy in this nation.,161
NA,One of the areas in which the least candour is,161
NA,"shown is industrial relations, where this gov-",161
NA,ernment is now pretending that it has a new,161
NA,policy which would make a difference to,161
NA,Australian families. (Time expired),161
NA,Mr Stanley Thomas Crisp,161
Mr HARDGRAVE ,Moreton) (7.35,161
NA,pm)-As unfortunately often has been the,161
NA,"case in recent months, I wish tonight to re-",161
NA,cord the passing of a great Australian. I think,161
NA,"it is important that, as individual members of",161
NA,"this place, we take time to pay tribute to",161
NA,people who maybe are not making a name,161
NA,"for themselves in the daily news, who are not",161
NA,on the television every night and who are not,161
NA,necessarily seeking any attention but just,161
NA,getting on with the job. Tonight I lament the,161
NA,"passing of Stanley Thomas Crisp, British",162
NA,"Empire Medal winner, Centenary Medal",162
NA,"winner, Australian Active Service Medal",162
NA,recipient 1945-75 with Clasps ‘Malaysia',162
NA,"and ‘Vietnam', General Service Medal with",162

NA,"Service and Good Conduct Medal, Austra-",162
NA,"lian Defence Medal, Pingat Jasa Malaysia",162
NA,Medal and Returned from Active Service,162
NA,Badge. Stan Crisp achieved the rank of Chief,162
NA,Petty Officer within the Royal Australian,162
NA,Navy-a ‘20-year man' and someone who,162
NA,saw active service in the Malaya confronta-,162
NA,tion and also from 1966-71 served Austra-,162
NA,lia's interests in Vietnam. In more recent,162
NA,times Stan Crisp found other ways to serve,162
NA,our country and our local community. From,162
NA,1995 Stan Crisp was the Secretary of the,162
NA,Yeronga-Dutton Park sub-branch of the RSL.,162
NA,He was made a life member of the Queen-,162
NA,sland RSL. For 12 years he was the pen-,162
NA,sioner welfare officer of the Yeronga-Dutton,162
NA,Park sub-branch and a qualified Justice of,162
NA,the Peace.,162
NA,"I take the time to mention Stan Crisp,",162
NA,cause he was a fundamentally decent man,162
NA,"whom, sadly, we lost on Sunday after what",162
NA,seemed to be a short battle with cancer. He,162
NA,was just 78 years of age. Stan was fighting,162
NA,with a great deal of determination to make,162
NA,the Anzac Day ceremonies at both Gair Park,162
NA,"and, indeed, at the Ekibin Memorial Park,",162
NA,Cracknell Road. I know that Stan was des-,162
NA,"perate to be at both ceremonies, but his",162
NA,"health made it impossible. Ken Railton, the",162
NA,ex-president of Yeronga-Dutton Park sub-,162
NA,"branch, was not sure on Anzac Day whether",162
NA,"Stan would actually see the day out, but in",162
NA,Stan's typical style he fought on.,162
NA,"I know that Ken and the new president,",162
NA,"Tony Robinson, and all members of the",162
NA,Yeronga-Dutton Park subbranch will miss,162
NA,"Stan. His straight-talking, right up and down",162
NA,approach to things was something that left an,162
NA,"indelible mark on me as the local member,",162
NA,and I am very grateful for everything he did.,162
NA,"Stan told me quite a few years ago, ‘You",162
NA,"need to get a bit of Navy into you, son; you",162
NA,need to get a bit of Navy experience.' When,162
NA,"the opportunity came up for me, under the",162
NA,Australian Defence Force parliamentary pro-,162
NA,"gram, to join the ranks of the defence forces",162
NA,in the Middle East and to go and see for my-,162
NA,"self what our troops were doing over there, I",162
NA,took it. So just a few weeks ago Stan was,162
NA,very much in my conversation. When I was,162
NA,"on the HMAS Toowoomba, I said, ‘I'm look-",162
NA,ing forward to getting back and talking to,162
NA,"Stan and saying, “Well, I've got a bit of",162
NA,Navy in me”.' When I spoke to the chief,162
NA,petty officers onboard the HMAS,162
NA,"Toowoomba, I knew the style of man that",162
NA,"Stan was because, again, we are seeing that",162
NA,"in the contemporary chief petty officers, the",162
NA,able seamen and all of the senior officers on,162
NA,board the Toowoomba.,162
NA,Stan Crisp would be proud of the work,162
NA,that is being done by his counterparts today.,162
NA,Australian Defence Force personnel are mak-,162
NA,being friends every day as we work with our,162
NA,"Iraqi counterparts to secure a long, lasting",162
NA,peace and freedom that are underpinned by a,162
NA,democracy of the Iraqi people's choosing.,162
NA,"Stan served on ships such as the Sydney, the",162
NA,"Cootumundra, the Melbourne, the Queens-",162
NA,"borough, the Vampire, the Yarra, the Voy-",162
NA,"ager, the Quickmatch, the Parramatta and",162
NA,the Vendetta. Stan's 20 years of service in,162
NA,"illuniform in Australia, which he completed in",162
NA,"June 1972, was only surpassed by the service",162
NA,he gave to Australia and particularly to the,162
NA,"local community, which centres around the",162
NA,"Yeronga-Dutton Park RSL and, indeed,",162
NA,"Yeronga Services Club, following his retire-",162

Ms BIRD ,Cunningham) (7.39 pm)-I,163
NA,take the opportunity this evening to address,163
NA,what no doubt will shape up to be a very im-,163
NA,portant debate in this country in the run-up to,163
NA,"the election, and that is the future of educa-",163
NA,tion and its role in improving the productiv-,163
NA,ity and the long-term prosperity of the na-,163
NA,tion. I want to address the claim by the gov-,163
NA,ernment that the budget announcements by,163
NA,the Treasurer prove that the government has,163
NA,its own education revolution underway. I will,163
NA,challenge that claim-I hope fairly signifi-,163
NA,"cantly, because there is so much that could",163
NA,be said-in the few minutes available to me.,163
NA,The centrepiece of the government's claim,163
NA,on education is the $5 billion university en-,163
NA,dowment fund. No doubt that is a reasonable,163
NA,"initiative, but it hardly addresses the issue",163
NA,university places and access and equity for,163
NA,university students. This fund will provide,163
NA,capital amounts of money-although obvi-,163
NA,ously not a great deal if it is only $300 mil-,163
NA,lion a year-and money for research facili-,163
NA,"ties. That money is welcome, but it does not",163
NA,address the real challenge facing the great,163
NA,majority of students who find that it is the,163
NA,cost of living that really creates a problem,163
NA,for them in completing their university stud-,163
NA,"ies. Indeed, with Wollongong University in",163
NA,"my electorate, I am constantly made aware",163
NA,by uni students of the struggle to balance,163
NA,their study and their work requirements and,163
NA,that they really have no other option but to,163
NA,work. Often many of them carry a full work-,163
NA,load on top of trying to complete their stud-,163
NA,"ies. So, while this centrepiece item no doubt",163
NA,"is welcome, it will hardly address the issues",163
NA,of making sure that many of our young peo-,163
NA,ple are able to access and complete univer-,163
NA,sity study.,163
NA,The sad thing about the government's,163
NA,"proposals in the budget under education,",163
NA,where they are trying to claim that they have,163
NA,"gazumped Labor, is that there was nothing",163
NA,about preschool education. Having a back-,163
NA,ground in both education and juvenile jus-,163
NA,"tice, I am profoundly aware of the impor-",163
NA,tance of the formative years for young peo-,163
NA,ple in both their social development and their,163
NA,educational development. Labor has commit-,163
NA,ted itself to providing 15 hours of preschool,163
NA,education a week for all four-year-old chil-,163
NA,dren in order to provide them with the solid,163
NA,foundation they will need when they start,163
NA,school. There is absolutely nothing more,163
NA,important that you could do than to make,163
NA,"sure, as much as you can, that every kid who",163
NA,starts school starts from a level playing field.,163
NA,The capacity to access the pre-reading and,163
NA,pre-numeracy type skills that you get in,163
NA,those programs is absolutely vital. There was,163
NA,of nothing at all from the government in the,163
NA,budget about preschool education. It has,163
NA,completely missed the point that early inter-,163
NA,"vention programs in all sorts of areas, par-",163
NA,"ticularly in education, can make a profound",163
NA,difference to the long-term learning of young,163
NA,people.,163
NA,Then we come to the schools sector. We,163
NA,"have a new commitment to an old pilot,",163
NA,which is the tutorial voucher scheme. We all,163
NA,remember what a great success that scheme,163
NA,"was! Indeed, I remember young people in",163
NA,my area who had not passed the 2003,163
NA,benchmark test being told that they had a,163
NA,"voucher, yet many of them did not get that",163
NA,voucher until after they had sat the 2005 test.,163
NA,Rather than the government extending that,163
NA,"program, I personally think it would be far",163
NA,better to use that money to provide literacy,163
NA,"and numeracy support in schools, as Labor",163
NA,has proposed in its education revolution pro-,163
NA,gram; that would have been a better option.,163
NA,If the government is going to run this priva-,163
NA,"tised version, it should at least ensure that the",163
NA,facilities and services are there to be,164
NA,vided to the young people who need them,164
NA,and it should not leave parents as disap-,164
NA,pointed as they were under the pilot.,164
NA,"Finally, there is the great initiative for",164
NA,technical education. As long as I have been,164
NA,"here, the government has been telling us that",164
NA,Labor people are far too wrapped up in uni-,164
NA,versity education and that they do not underSydney.,164
NA,stand how important vocational education is.,164
NA,What was the big loser in this budget? It,164
NA,vocational education and training. The best,164
NA,the government could manage were three,164
NA,"new ATCs, when it does not even have the",164
NA,current promised crop up and running. Those,164
NA,that are up and running are not even filling,164
NA,their quotas for students. The students that,164
NA,"are in them, by and large, are missing out",164
NA,employers; they cannot even get people to,164
NA,take them on for their work component. So,164
NA,let us throw some more money at something,164
NA,"that is struggling to survive,",164
NA,budget provides a very weak response to the,164
NA,needs for education to develop productivity,164
NA,for the future. (Time expired),164
NA,Cook Electorate: Proposed Desalination,164
Mr BAIRD ,Cook) (7.45 pm)-I would,164
NA,like to draw the attention of the House to,164
NA,further negligent policy making by the New,164
NA,South Wales government in relation to its,164
NA,proposed desalination plant on the Kurnell,164
NA,Peninsula. My electorate of Cook is to be the is enough.,164
NA,"home of this proposed plant, and just a few",164
NA,days ago the arrangements for its construc-,164
NA,tion became public knowledge. The state,164
NA,government is effectively going to dig,164
NA,trenches down the middle of the Sutherland,164
NA,Shire and run pipes for the carriage of water,164
NA,from Botany Bay to the inner suburbs of,164
NA,Sydney. These arrangements are very bad,164
NA,news for Sutherland Shire residents. We are,164
NA,being used as nothing more than a thorough-,164
NA,fare for the water supplies of inner Sydney.,164
NA,pro- The plans have confirmed what most of us,164
NA,feared about a desalination plant in Kurnell.,164
NA,Not only will the plant's construction cause,164
NA,mass disruptions to shire residents over a,164
NA,two-year period; it will also contribute to the,164
NA,further decline of Botany Bay-all this for a,164
NA,plant which will produce a relatively small,164
NA,volume of water for the inner suburbs of,164
NA,Sutherland Shire residents have a long his-,164
NA,was tory of doing their bit for the benefit of,164
NA,"greater Sydney, but the desalination plant is",164
NA,taking our generosity too far. The lack of,164
NA,community consultation about the construc-,164
NA,"tion of this plant, especially at local council",164
NA,"level, has been entirely inadequate. When",164
NA,"residential driveways are blocked, local car",164
NA,on parks and parklands begin to close and noise,164
NA,levels from the pipe's construction reach se-,164
NA,"vere levels, the shire will be fully aware of",164
NA,the raw deal we got from the New South,164
NA,as it is. This Wales government.,164
NA,Whilst residents will be inconvenienced,164
NA,"by these disruptions, a larger concern for us",164
NA,all is the permanent environmental damage,164
NA,the desal plant will cause to Kurnell and,164
NA,"Plant Botany Bay. The environment in this region,",164
NA,which is of course the landing site of Captain,164
NA,Cook and the birthplace of our modern na-,164
NA,"tion, has suffered enough damage over the",164
NA,years through overdevelopment and sand,164
NA,mining. Surely now is the time to say enough,164
NA,The desal pipelines outlined in these plans,164
NA,will stretch eight kilometres from Kurnell to,164
NA,Kyeemagh. In order to lay these pipelines I,164
NA,understand a four-metre deep trench will be,164
NA,dug across the bottom of Botany Bay. More,164
NA,than a million cubic metres of sand will be,164
NA,dug from the floor in an eight kilometre arc.,164
NA,Whilst most of this sand will be used as,164
NA,"backfill, this process will have a detrimental",164
NA,effect on our bay. The most recent environ-,164
NA,mental study of the effects of the desal plant,164
NA,on the environment tells us that Botany Bay,165
NA,will lose a further 2.6 hectares of seagrass.,165
NA,Whilst this only amounts to approximately,165
NA,"one per cent of the Botany Bay area, it shows",165
NA,"us that, rather than finding ways of preserv-",165
NA,"ing the environment in our region, the New",165
NA,South Wales government feels that it is okay,165
NA,to just take a little more. And what will re-,165
NA,place this seagrass? Eight kilometres of pipe-,165
NA,"lines, covered in concrete. Kurnell is of",165
NA,course a place of major historical signifi-,165
NA,"cance, but it is also an environmentally",165
NA,noteworthy site. It is home to a variety of,165
NA,rare birds and marine life and is a Ramsar,165
NA,site. I still wonder what effect the 750 mil-,165
NA,lion litres of hot concentrated brine will have,165
NA,on this wildlife once it is sent off the coast,165
NA,Kurnell every day.,165
NA,The desalination plant is strongly opposed,165
NA,by many constituents in my electorate. After,165
NA,watching several weeks of solid coastal rain,165
NA,"lost out to sea, many of us are wondering",165
NA,why the New South Wales government is,165
NA,unable to invest a small amount of the $1.8,165
NA,billion being spent on the plant in other wa-,165
NA,ter saving strategies. As announced by the,165
NA,"Treasurer last night, the Australian govern-",165
NA,ment is offering substantial initiatives to en-,165
NA,courage people to install rainwater tanks in,165
NA,their homes. The message is clear for all ju-,165
NA,risdictions responsible for the provision or,165
NA,management of water resources: we need to,165
NA,catch and use more rain. This is an obvious,165
NA,and sensible solution. It is a solution far su-,165
NA,perior to digging up suburbs to send desali-,165
NA,nated seawater halfway across Sydney. Fur-,165
NA,"thermore, it is an environmentally sustain-",165
NA,able approach.,165
NA,The desalination plant was a major issue,165
NA,for shire residents in the recent New South,165
NA,Wales state election. With the election now,165
NA,over I call upon the New South Wales gov-,165
NA,ernment to cancel the construction of the,165
NA,desalination plant in Kurnell. I ask that they,165
NA,revisit more effective strategies in water,165
NA,management that are more environmentally,165
NA,responsible.,165
NA,Budget 2007-08,165
Ms GRIERSON ,Newcastle) (7.49,165
NA,pm)-I cannot pass up this opportunity to,165
NA,have a closer look at what this budget has,165
NA,offered for education. Having spent three,165
NA,"decades of my career as a teacher, a demon-",165
NA,"stration teacher, a curriculum consultant and",165
NA,"a principal, and over a quarter of a century as",165
NA,a parent-as many people here have-of,165
NA,"children passing through education systems,",165
NA,"I have a special interest, just like the Austra-",165
NA,lian people.,165
NA,So what did the budget offer? Early learn-,165
NA,of ing? A best start in life? Some early interven-,165
NA,tion programs for children? Some medical,165
NA,checks to make sure they start school prop-,165
NA,erly? Nothing. For primary school education,165
NA,all I could see was a $700 voucher system,165
NA,for parents to put towards private tuition. It,165
NA,sounds good but there was nothing for sup-,165
NA,port teachers for children with learning diffi-,165
NA,"culties, nothing extra for school counsellors",165
NA,to do those diagnostic assessments and no,165
NA,funds for special literacy programs or nu-,165
NA,meracy programs. For those sorts of ap-,165
NA,"proaches, which allow each child to have",165
NA,"greater individual attention and support,",165
NA,there was nothing at all.,165
NA,I am waiting to see what is in this $700,165
NA,voucher system that can make sure children,165
NA,actually benefit and to stop people making,165
NA,close private arrangements like nominating,165
NA,an accommodating friend or relative as a,165
NA,tutor and then pocketing the money and de-,165
NA,nying a child an opportunity. What about,165
NA,those tutors who do not deliver value for,165
NA,"money, who do not understand the special",165
NA,"needs of students? They will do very well,",165
NA,"thank you very much, but the students are",165
NA,"not at the centre of this decision. Apparently,",165
NA,that is not the government's concern-as,165
NA,long as the cheque is in the mail in an elec-,165
NA,"tion year, as long as those flagpoles have",166
NA,flags flying and as long as chaplains are,166
NA,"there to provide some sort of support, we",166
NA,apparently do not really need to worry about,166
NA,child-centred learning.,166
NA,Perhaps secondary schools are benefiting.,166
NA,But there is not much there at all. There is a,166
NA,"$5,000 bonus for teachers who complete-",166
NA,and I quote the minister from question time,166
NA,today-‘the government's summer school'.,166
NA,It sounds a bit like the Bart Simpson ap-,166
NA,"proach, doesn't it-write 100 times on the",166
NA,"blackboard: ‘AWAs are good, unions are",166
NA,bad.' That is a real concern. What does a,166
NA,government summer school look like? Per-,166
NA,haps it is individual schools that need to say,166
NA,what professional development and training,166
NA,"would benefit their students, not a govern-",166
NA,ment summer school. It sounds exceedingly,166
NA,like Big Brother.,166
NA,At this stage little is known about the,166
NA,"sible $50,000 for succeeding schools but, by",166
NA,my reckoning and my knowledge of schools,166
NA,"in my electorate, that is a lot of schools. I",166
NA,"hope they all achieve that $50,000 bonus,",166
NA,because they have certainly worked for it.,166
NA,"But, as to what government hoops the",166
NA,schools will need to jump through to gain,166
NA,"that money, we just do not know at this",166
NA,stage. What about our TAFEs? There does,166
NA,not seem to be much there either. The addi-,166
NA,"tional $1,000 or so for apprentices in their",166
NA,first and second years is a very welcome im-,166
NA,provement as long as you have a job and can,166
NA,gain an apprenticeship. But given that the,166
NA,retention rates for apprentices under the gov-,166
NA,"ernment scheme fall below 50 per cent, any-",166
NA,thing that helps young people complete their,166
NA,apprenticeships will be welcomed by every-,166
NA,one in this field.,166
NA,Three additional Australian technical col-,166
NA,leges just does not cut it for me. These have,166
NA,"been beset with problems: finding teachers,",166
NA,"setting up adequate facilities, commencing in",166
NA,time to deliver training. What a pity this,166
NA,funding did not go to TAFEs and industry,166
NA,based training companies like the Hunter,166
NA,Institute and group training companies in my,166
NA,electorate that are already attaining retention,166
NA,rates of 80 per cent to 90 per cent for their,166
NA,apprentices in areas of critical trade short-,166
NA,ages. But it is an election year and some pa-,166
NA,"rochial announcements in a few key seats,",166
NA,"like the seat of Macquarie perhaps, just",166
NA,might help this neglectful government to,166
NA,gain the votes it needs to save its skin.,166
NA,Perhaps the budget dollars have been di-,166
NA,"rected to universities. On the surface, yes,",166
NA,"there are some funds there, but let us look",166
NA,more closely. A $5 billion endowment fund,166
NA,sounds good but $300 million a year to be,166
NA,shared between 38 universities will not do,166
NA,very much to address the neglect and the,166
NA,backlog in capital maintenance and replace-,166
NA,posment programs. In the almost half a billion,166
NA,dollars for research facilities there is nothing,166
NA,for the Hunter Medical Research Institute at,166
NA,Newcastle University-an outstanding re-,166
NA,"search facility, which is a joint venture with",166
NA,the Hunter New England Health Service.,166
NA,They have a pressing need. They have to,166
NA,relocate and consolidate facilities. They have,166
NA,to make some decisions now but they re-,166
NA,ceived no funds.,166
NA,"So does this new budget, in terms of edu-",166
NA,"cation, promise to lift Australia to the top of",166
NA,the OECD tables in productivity and innova-,166
NA,tion? I think not. What a dreadful waste! It is,166
NA,"Labor's education revolution for me, and I",166
NA,think that will be the option of the Australian,166
NA,people as well.,166
NA,Budget 2007-08,166
Mr BARTLETT ,Macquarie) (7.54,166
NA,pm)-It is really quite disappointing to see,166
NA,"members opposite scratching around, trying",166
NA,to find something negative to say about a,166
NA,budget that has been received overwhelm-,166
NA,ingly in a positive way and that contains a,166
NA,vast number of positive initiatives. It locks in,167
NA,"our prosperity, continues our strong track",167
NA,record of sound economic management and,167
NA,invests for the future. Yet we have to go,167
NA,through this charade where members oppo-,167
NA,site try to find something negative for the,167
NA,sake of negativity.,167
NA,There is much I would like to say about,167
NA,the strengths of this budget generally but I,167
NA,will save it for the debate on the appropria-,167
NA,tions bill. Tonight I would like to speak,167
NA,about some aspects regarding education that,167
NA,are of particular interest to me. The member,167
NA,for Newcastle has referred to the funding,167
NA,announcement of a dental school for Charles,167
NA,Sturt University. I am delighted to see the,167
NA,assistant minister at the dispatch box. The,167
NA,member for Parkes has worked with me and,167
NA,"a number of other colleagues, including the",167
NA,"member for Riverina and Senator Nash, to",167
NA,"bring this proposal to fruition. Last night, in",167
NA,"the budget, the Treasurer announced $65",167
NA,million for a dental school for Charles Sturt,167
NA,University. This is an initiative that will,167
NA,vide long-term solutions to the dental crisis,167
NA,"that affects New South Wales, particularly",167
NA,regional New South Wales. This proposal,167
NA,includes $54.5 million for the establishment,167
NA,"of the dental school itself, $4 million for",167
NA,dent accommodation and $6.6 million over,167
NA,four years for the places for training in the,167
NA,dental schools.,167
NA,The structure is that the undergraduate,167
NA,preclinical and clinical work will be done at,167
NA,the Orange and Wagga campuses. For the,167
NA,graduate years-years 4 and 5-clinics will,167
NA,"be established in Bathurst, Albury and",167
NA,Dubbo. This proposal that will cover vast,167
NA,areas of central western and western New,167
NA,South Wales that area suffering so badly. The,167
NA,proposal is that there will be 240 dental,167
NA,places in the pipeline and students will begin,167
NA,studying in 2009. Three years later there will,167
NA,be an anticipated 30 graduates a year in oral,167
NA,health and related oral health sciences. Then,167
NA,two years after that there will be the start of a,167
NA,stream of 30 graduates in dentistry each year,167
NA,from these clinical schools in this university.,167
NA,This is a quality proposal. I want to con-,167
NA,gratulate Charles Sturt University on the,167
NA,amount of work that they put into building,167
NA,this proposal and for their research and hard,167
NA,work. They put in the hard yards.,167
NA,"It was obvious, when this proposal was",167
NA,"brought to me and to my colleagues, that it",167
NA,was worth supporting. This proposal is a,167
NA,"win-win situation. Firstly, it provides extra",167
NA,education places in regional New South,167
NA,"Wales, in the central west of New South",167
NA,"Wales, which is a part of the state in which I",167
NA,"am very interested. It provides improved,",167
NA,"increased, expanded educational opportuni-",167
NA,ties for young people in this part of the state.,167
NA,"Secondly, it directly adds to the supply of",167
NA,dental services because in years 4 and 5,167
NA,those students will be under very close su-,167
NA,pervision working in those clinical facilities,167
NA,"in Bathurst, Dubbo, Orange, Wagga and Al-",167
NA,"probury, directly providing both public and pri-",167
NA,vate dental services in those areas of great,167
NA,"need. Thirdly, and perhaps most signifi-",167
NA,"cantly, this project will address the dental",167
NA,"crisis at its root source, and that is an inade-",167
NA,stuquate supply of dentists. By increasing the,167
NA,"supply of dentists, we will be addressing the",167
NA,key issues that affect the shortage of dental,167
NA,services right throughout the state.,167
NA,This is a quality proposal. I want to con-,167
NA,gratulate everyone involved. I want to con-,167
NA,gratulate Charles Sturt University Vice-,167
NA,Chancellor Professor Ian Goulter. I want to,167
NA,congratulate Marge Bollinger and the com-,167
NA,mittee of volunteers that were behind this. I,167
NA,want to congratulate and thank my col-,167
NA,leagues on assisting me in this project.,167

NA,a number of unhappy veterans during phone as-,210
NA,assessments are part of the problem. These peo-,210
NA,I stand to be corrected if I am wrong-with a,210
NA,"elderly people. Also, in discussion with us,",210
NA,out this work on behalf of ACH Group said,210
NA,they were giving were indicating to some,210
NA,some of the changes and the impacts of the,210
NA,they will not mind me mentioning this. Legacy,210
NA,"members in this place, our electorate officers",210
NA,work out there. It appears that some of their,210
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,210
NA,people may have been approached by some of,211
NA,way that they would for support. In the way that,211
NA,it appears that they were seeing some unnecessary,211
NA,upon some of our veteran widows in particular.,211
NA,"On this side of the chamber, we are not against",211
NA,something then obviously you do. But when,211
NA,people-those living on their own in particular-you,211
NA,way you are carrying out those changes has the,211
NA,wish for.,211
NA,I will just outline very briefly some of,211
NA,"names, even though the minister is aware",211
NA,very honest with him. An elderly couple in their,211
NA,ping and an hour and a half for cleaning once,211
NA,"now only one person, instead of two people,",211
NA,"has to pay slightly more. It is still a small cost,",211
NA,is that the worst thing that has changed is that,211
NA,ers anymore. In the past they were taken out,211
NA,stand that it is for insurance reasons. I am happy,211
NA,"of view of my constituents, it was the only",211
NA,"for a purposeful reason, maybe other than going",211
NA,expeditions. That was to change or it had changed.,211
NA,Everybody I am talking about is in their,211
NA,someone coming every day to shower and dress,211
NA,ping and socialising and two hours a fortnight,211
NA,three times a week. She cannot dress herself,211
NA,now has only two hours for shopping and is,211
NA,"ber. She understands that, if she wants to go",211
NA,to be made available. I am not sure whether that,211
NA,is pretty concerned about the,211
NA,A gentleman was previously receiving a,211
NA,three showers a week. He has to deal with some,211
NA,sumed to virtually a daily shower. He cannot,211
NA,appointments or social outings. He can no longer,211
NA,past. That was mentioned constantly. He is,211
NA,In my office we are trying to see whether,211
NA,run by a community service. These folk have,211
NA,"gram. If anything changes, it is a huge issue for",211
NA,"talk about it. When change is needed, yes, let",211
NA,are doing and somehow walk these,211
NA,"There is another person, a woman who is",211
NA,the phone assessment process. She is uncomfortable,211
NA,"seen, in the true sense of an assessment. Her",211
NA,"has been involved. As a result of Legacy's involvement,",211
NA,the recipients of this program in the normal,211
NA,"they understood it, in relation to the changes,",211
NA,"stress, as they would describe it, being put",211
NA,changes. If there is a good reason to change,211
NA,"you are dealing with vulnerable, frail, elderly",211
NA,have to make absolutely certain that the,211
NA,least possible negative impact that you could,211
NA,the things that have changed. I will not mention,211
NA,"of whom I am speaking about, because we were",211
NA,80s were getting an hour and a half for shop-,211
NA,"a fortnight, alternating. That has changed and",211
NA,has to do both of those jobs. The elderly couple,211
NA,but they have to pay slightly more. The belief,211
NA,the clients cannot go out shopping with the car-,211
NA,shopping; now they are left at home. I under-,211
NA,for all of this to be clarified. From the point,211
NA,opportunity for the gentleman to leave the house,211
NA,"to a doctor, and he enjoyed those shopping",211
NA,"late 70s, 80s or 90s. Another lady previously had",211
NA,"her, along with three hours a week for shop-",211
NA,for cleaning. Now she is getting showered only,211
NA,properly because of her physical problems. She,211
NA,not allowed to go out shopping with a staff mem-,211
NA,"to the bank and nobody can take her, a PIN needs",211
NA,"is completely accurate, but it is a query. She",211
NA,changes that are affecting her.,211
NA,shower every day and that has been cut back to,211
NA,physical problems. I think that has been re-,211
NA,get transport assistance from DVA for medical,211
NA,go shopping with the carer as he could in the,211
NA,feeling the lack of availability of transport.,211
NA,we can link up someone like him with a program,211
NA,stability in their life because they have a pro-,211
NA,these folk. It is for those reasons that I want to,211
NA,"us do it, but can we please be aware of what we",211
NA,folk through what needs to be done.,211
NA,"80-plus years of age, who is really angry about",211
NA,with it and feels that she is not being,211
NA,hours have also been dramatically cut. Legacy,211
NA,I understand that any changes for her,211
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,211
NA,have been deferred-maybe to around June-to,212
NA,"across to other services, if that be the case.",212
NA,"There is another woman, who is 85-plus,",212
NA,"assist his mother, but, again, certain services",212
NA,hours a fortnight and then to nothing. I understand,212
NA,"spring-clean but then said, ‘We can't do that",212
NA,"stripped by you first, and we will not do the",212
NA,"we have been given, and we have fed these stories",212
NA,his reply in a moment. There is also another,212
NA,washing and basic cleaning cut back to 1½ hours.,212
NA,"Legacy is involved with her. As I said, I am",212
NA,this because there may be good reasons,212
NA,"In the minister's letter, he said to me that",212
NA,war widows and widowers with low-care needs,212
NA,plaud that-and that it provides domestic assistance;,212
NA,personal care; and safety related home and,212
NA,available to people with a carer-I understand,212
NA,sonal care is the stuff of import to these people.,212
NA,the minister's letter. Suffice to say that the,212
NA,people were incorrectly assessed or incorrectly,212
NA,"do not know whether that is true, because",212
NA,The minister also said that where they believe,212
NA,"appropriate supply of service, some folk",212
NA,programs or other community programs. That is,212
NA,"of the day, I want these people to get the services",212
NA,and sensitive way possible. If a reassessment,212
NA,"age group, I think it would be better if it",212
NA,"into their home and actually see their surroundings,",212
NA,"ity, or otherwise, and make an assessment on that basis.",212
NA,"Be that as it may, should there be the decision",212
NA,have to be reassessed and reassigned to another,212
NA,so that it does not result in the trauma that,212
NA,ple. It is fair to say that some of that trauma,212
NA,"their situation in life. For whatever reason, I",212
NA,"ing the minister but, somehow down the line,",212
NA,happy when I get a phone call from a 92-year-old,212
NA,"markably well in her own home, considering",212
NA,ring to; one of them has a very severe sight,212
NA,"has been getting, which was only three hours",212
NA,wonders whether a cutback of that nature is really,212
NA,"time, does not cost a lot of money and does",212
NA,it.,212

NA,quite honestly to the minister. I will refer to,212
NA,darling who is 92. She had three hours a week for,212

NA,that-but the domestic assistance and the per-,212

NA,Some 21 years ago I concluded a 13-year,213

NA,place-a ballot that did not have any use because,213
NA,during this debate to bring the Main Committee's,213
NA,to appeal to the minister and to his folk that,213
NA,"Speaker, I seek to intervene.",213
NA,the member for Canberra willing to give,213
NA,the purpose of what you have been discuss-,213
NA,care assessment team to assess the clients?,213
NA,to answer that. Somewhere in the minister's,213
NA,for these people-and I stand to be corrected if I,213
NA,need to go through an ACAT assessment to get,213
NA,a care at home package. So if this process has,213
NA,"whatever reason, the minister is suggesting in part",213
NA,"an ACAT assessment for that purpose-that is,",213
NA,"entirely different package, which would be a care",213
NA,I thank the member for her intervention. As I,213

NA,we are dealing with people in this category. I,213

NA,it may. I thank the chamber for its attention.,213
NA,of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation,213

NA,obligation to those that serve in the defence,213
NA,period of my life when I worked for the then de-,213
NA,"generation of officers of that department in that,",213

NA,and safety nature in peacetime movements and,213
NA,to indicate that it marched in moratorium,213
NA,was in the last ballot of conscription to take,213
NA,that intake was never taken up. But I am,213
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,213
NA,also of a generation that did not see active,214
NA,decision to send forces overseas and for the,214
NA,ex-servicewomen were treated. I admit that at,214

NA,inely ashamed of the way in which those,214
NA,I am pleased that in the intervening nearly,214
NA,many processes have taken place that have healed,214
NA,that sometimes Korean vets do not think that,214
NA,times be of the opinion that they are beginning,214
NA,service men and women. But the lessons that,214
NA,the way in which we are able to treat and administer,214
NA,proper compensation and proper,214
NA,To the extent that this piece of legislation,214
NA,some of the Veterans' Entitlements Act measures,214
NA,opposition has no great problem with it. But,214

NA,the assessment of claims. This was first brought,214
NA,the local RSLs that service the community that,214
NA,pose from my past career within the department,214
NA,which these things have to be assessed. The,214
NA,references to the way in which these things,214
NA,would have hoped that that made it a simpler,214
NA,the proper periods. This is a matter that the,214
NA,"ans' affairs, touched upon.",214
NA,When we look at the last annual report,214

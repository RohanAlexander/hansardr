NA,"Mr .KELLY-I n view, of the fact that",13
NA,the Government itself asked the advice of,13
NA,the Imperial Defence Committee on the,13
NA,question ofAustralian defences-(1 ) Will,13
NA,the Government inform the House as soon,13
NA,as a decision is come to if it is its intention,13
NA,not to follow the advice it has itself sought,13
NA,on the larger questions involved? (2) I f,13

NA,"Imperial Defence Committee's .advice, will",13
NA,the Government put the House in possession,13
NA,of the Imperial Defence Committee's argu-,13
NA,ments on the question as well as that of its,13
NA,local advisers?,13
Mr DEAKIN , I have within the last,13
NA,few weeks addressed the Home authorities,13
NA,by despatch with regard to the very incon-,13
NA,venient and uncertain practice at present,13
NA,"obtaining of marking "" confidential"" cer-",13
NA,tain communications passing between them,13
NA,and ourselves. The principle followed is,13
NA,"not at all clear, though we have been at",13
NA,some pains to try to discover it. The re-,13
NA,quest preferred was for a complete scheme,13
NA,"of Australian defence, which must neces-",13
NA,sarily be discussed by Parliament.,13
NA,When Ministers have had an opportunity,13
NA,"to read the document, and it has been con-",13
NA,sidered by the Minister of Defence and his,13
NA,"advisers, I propose to inquire whether it",13
NA,is inadvisable to make public any part of,13
NA,"it. From a cursory inspection, I think that",13
NA,"there are few, if any, passages which should",13
NA,not be published. I f our views differ in,13
NA,any respect from the advice given by the,13
NA,"high authority, whose opinion we have",13
NA,"asked, it is only fair that we should",13
NA,give the reasons for the' difference. We are,13
NA,"not compelled to accept that advice, but",13
NA,we are bound to give our grounds for not,13
NA,following it. Honorable members will,13
NA,agree that the fullestinformation should be,13
NA,"put before Parliament, so long as we do not",13
NA,touch on points which may indicate weak-,13
NA,"ness in our chain of defence, or possibili-",13
NA,ties which it is not advisable to suggest.,13

Mr ROBINSON ,Wannon) [10.51] - L,15
NA,hold that complaints under this Bill should,15
NA,"be limited to persons who allege that they be,",15
NA,are suffering from unfair competition.,15
NA,These individuals should be compelled,15
NA,put their complaints in writing. Officers,15
NA,of the .Department should not be permitted,15
NA,to transform themselves into advocates for,15
NA,any particular manufacturer or producer.,15
Mr BAMFORD ,Th e same argument,15
NA,might be applied to any Customs House,15
NA,officer at the present time.,15
Mr ROBINSON ,Bu t the complaint,15
NA,which is usually made by Customs officers,15
NA,is that some person is attempting to deone,15
NA,fraud the revenue. Under the clause in its,15
NA,"present form, a special privilege",15
NA,granted to persons lodging complaints. Un-,15
NA,less we insist that they shall put their,15

Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Hume-Min,15
NA,ister for Trade and Customs) [10.55].,15
NA,- I f the honorable and learned mem-,15
NA,ber for Wannon will look at,15
NA,early part of the clause he will see the,15
NA,that under it anyoutside person lodging,15
NA,a complaint is bound to put his complaint,15
NA,in writing. An amendment has been in-,15
NA,serted to that effect. The proposal to pub-,15
NA,lish in the Commonwealth Gazette any,15
NA,memorandum or statement which may be,15
NA,made by an officer of the Department to,15
NA,"the Comptroller-General would, to a very",15
NA,"large extent, paralyze action on the part",15
NA,the Comptroller-General.,15
Mr ROBINSON ,W e do not want that.,15
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , T h e clause will,15
NA,work in this fashion : Let us suppose that an,15
NA,outside person were aggrieved. He would,15
NA,make his complaint in writing. When it,15
NA,"came before the Comptroller-General, pro-",15
NA,bably that officer would refer i t to the Col-,15
NA,lector of Customs in the particular State,15
NA,affected. I t is not proper that communi-,15
NA,cations which pass between the Comptroller,15
NA,and his officers should be published in the,15
NA,I Gazette. But when the Comptroller-Gene-,15
NA,ral makes a statement it must be made,15
NA,public. To a large extent he must rely,15
NA,subupon the information that he has obtained,15
NA,fromi his officers. We must allow the De-,15
NA,of partment some latitude in acquiring the,15
NA,of the necessary information upon which the,15
NA,informaComptroller-General is to act.,15
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [10.57] -I t,15
NA,to me that the certificate which the,15
NA,must issue in all these,15
NA,"cases is a certificate to his own Minister,",15
NA,"and, therefore, there is no reason why the",15
NA,"original informant's name, whoever he",15
NA,should not go with it. The,15
NA,determination of the question of whe-,15
NA,to ther a prohibition shall be imposed on,15
NA,imported goods is afterwards to be re-,15
NA,"ferred to a Justice of the High Court, as",15
NA,"provided in sub-clause 2. That provision,",15
NA,"however, does not specify that the certifi-",15
NA,cate shall be referred to a Justice. Ob-,15
NA,viously the Minister should know the source,15
NA,from which these charges have emanated.,15
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,S o he w i l l .,15

NA,Amendment of the amendment agreed to.,15
Mr FOWLER ,Perth) [11] - I move- _,15

NA,""" (4) I f the unfairness in the competition is",15
NA,indicated in respect of prices the,15
NA,Comptroller-General shall specify,15
NA,what in his opinion are fair selling,15
NA,prices for the goods sought to be pro-,15
NA,tected under this Act or which may be,15
NA,imported subject to any specified con-,15
NA,"ditions or restrictions under this Act.""",15
NA,"My proposal fairly well explains itself,",15
NA,but I may mention that my object is to,15
NA,of carry out what I think may be regarded,15
NA,"as one of the intentions of the B i l l , al-",15
NA,though the provisions for carrying out that,15
NA,intention are in one important respect very,15
NA,imperfect. I refer to the protection that,15
NA,will be afforded to the consumers.,15
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wher e would the,15
NA,"protection to the consumer come in, i f ,",15
NA,"say, the price of raisins were fixed to-day",15
NA,"at 3d. per lb., and to-morrow they went",15
NA,down to 2 i d . per lb. ?,15
Mr FOWLER , I merely wish to es-,15
NA,tablish a maximum that will prevent the,15
NA,consumer being exploited to an abnormal,16
NA,extent Prices may be reduced as much common,16
NA,"as a competitor pleases, but the object of",16
NA,my amendment is to provide that they tinual,16
NA,shall not go above a reasonable figure.,16
NA,One of my strongest objections to the policy above,16
NA,"of protection, as it has been underprivileged",16
NA,"stood, is that whilst the manufacturer sejust,",16
NA,"cures the advantages of such a policy, the",16
NA,consumer is left at the mercy of the manuthe community.,16
NA,"facturer, and of such competition as may guaranteed",16
NA,be unlikely in the circumstances. I f by a,16
NA,measure of this kind we establish what the,16
NA,"may be called abnormal conditions, by shutreturn",16
NA,ting out imports that would come into compaid-up,16
NA,petition with local articles and thereby consumers.,16
NA,tend to keep down prices to a reasonable,16
NA,"level, then, in fairness to the consumer,",16
NA,we ought to protect him from the possibility,16
NA,of having to pay such extortionate prices,16
NA,as would be possible i f the prohibition,16
NA,tended in certain circumstances under this to say that-,16
NA,Bill were brought about. Within the last,16
NA,forty-eight hours I have had placed in my ages,16
NA,hands a small pamphlet bearing out my than,16
NA,"views on this subject, which was written of",16
NA,by a gentleman who has had much to do surplus,16
NA,with the sale and distribution,16
NA,harvesters in Australia. I refer to Mr.,16
NA,"T. MCBride, who is at present in New Zea-",16
NA,land. Whilst here Mr MCBride always the,16
NA,took a keen and intelligent interest in the that,16
NA,social and economic conditions of Aus-,16
NA,"tralia, ancl I believe that he is now distrolling",16
NA,playing a similar interest in regard to New,16
NA,Zealand. He was for many years general by,16
NA,director of the business of the Massey-Harbe,16
NA,"ris Company in Australia, so that his views of",16
NA,on this subject should be regarded as those,16
NA,"of a man of sound business experience, and",16
NA,not those of an impracticable or unreasonnative,16
NA,ably idealistic thinker. In the little pamphevery,16
NA,let in question he is advocating in connexion,16
NA,with New Zealand's home industries a sysgoods,16
NA,tem by which protection could be extended,16
NA,"both to the manufacturer, the worker,",16
NA,"consumer- a system of protection, to which,",16
NA,"by the way, I should have very little",16
NA,"jection, since it would in many respects",16
NA,verv closely approximate to my ideal of,16
NA,the nationalization of such industries as,16
NA,practically monopolies. The writer,16
NA,amongst other things-,16
NA,No reasonable person will at this time object,16
NA,"to a fair compensation for capital, but,",16
NA,"fore, capital has been permitted to take",16
NA,"- right, under the sanction of tradition,",16
NA,"tion, and established custom, all the surplus",16
NA,earnings made possible by the combined produc-,16
NA,"tive power of capital, labour, and society,",16
NA,consumed their joint products.,16
NA,We now see clearly and unmistakably that,16
NA,fairness demands broader and wiser,16
NA,"treatment for the consumers, who are the source",16
NA,of all profits. We also perceive that the con-,16
NA,labour agitation and the consumers' grow-,16
NA,ing discontent are mainly about the customary,16
NA,retention by capital of all the surplus over and,16
NA,a fair interest. This exploitation by the,16
NA,"few is unfair, unreasonable, and un-",16
NA,"and cannot continue without bitterness,",16
NA,"serious friction, stagnation, and great loss to",16
NA,Our manufacturers should be satisfied with a,16
NA,liberal maximum percentage on their,16
NA,capital i f given by protection all the trade of,16
NA,"country in their respective lines, and should",16
NA,"to the consumers annually, in cash or",16
NA,"shares, the surplus that may have been",16
NA,temporarily but unnecessarily taken from the,16
Mr SKENE ,Wha t guarantee could be,16
NA,given that thev had returned the surplus ?,16
Mr FOWLER , Mr MCBride goes,16
NA,"into the matter fully, but I do not wish to",16
NA,ingo into details at this stage. He goes on,16
NA,Local combination and its attendant advant-,16
NA,would be infinitely belter for all concerned,16
NA,"Tariff protection. I am, however, in favour",16
NA,l,16
NA,"both combination and protection, provided the",16
NA,savings thereby effected are returned to,16
NA,"the consumers, but not otherwise, as any other",16
NA,o'f Canadian basis will not endure.,16
NA,T. He has also some observations in regard to,16
NA,methods of controlling a combination,16
NA,ought to be interesting to us at this,16
NA,juncture. He writes-,16
NA,There are only two practical ways of con-,16
NA,"a combine or a trust, viz. :-ist . As a",16
NA,temporary or evolutionary expedient; to specify,16
NA,"law the maximum interest or profit, & c , to",16
NA,"allowed to capital, and to leave each line '",16
NA,business under the control of private owners.,16
NA,2nd. I f . a guaranteed maximum profit is not,16
NA,accepted by capital whilst an uncertain minimum,16
NA,"wage is accepted by labour, then the only alter-",16
NA,in the interests of the people and the,16
NA,State is complete public ownership of each and,16
NA,"consolidated industry, which will insure",16
NA,"fair conditions for labour, and also that the",16
NA,in every line of production shall be sup-,16
NA,plied to the consumer at or near cost.,16
NA,and I commend the last observations to the,16
NA,Committee. Although not strictly relevant,16
NA,"obto my proposals, they are worthy of atten-",16
NA,"tion, coming as they do from a level-",16
NA,"headed, practical, successful business man,",16
NA,are who has been identified with the production,16
NA,says and distribution of goods under a trust in,16
NA,"Australia, and who ought, therefore, to",16
NA,know what he is talking about. The,16
NA,heretoamendment which I now propose is the first,16
NA,"as a of a series of amendments, the others being",16
NA,legislaconsequent upon it. My idea is that when,16
NA,this unfairness is indicated in connexion,16
NA,"that with prices, it should be part of the duty",16
NA,of the Comptroller-General to go into the,16
NA,9,17
NA,Australian Industries [REPRESENTATIVES.],17
NA,"matter, and i f he sees that there is, or is",17
NA,1,17
NA,"likely to be, some exploitation of the",17
NA,"public in the way of prices, he",17
NA,"should say what, in his opinion,",17
NA,would be a fair and reasonable price,17
NA,for the goods proposed to be protected,17
NA,"under this Bill. Then his re:ommendation,",17
NA,along with the other recommendations and,17
NA,"information indicated by the clause, would",17
NA,"be sent on to the Justice, who would again",17
NA,consider what would be a fair selling price,17
NA,"for the goods proposed to be protected, or",17
NA,introduced into the country under special,17
NA,"restrictions. Having done that, the",17
NA,Justice would determine that the goods,17
NA,against the importation of which' a,17
NA,protest had been lodged should be excluded,17
NA,"from the local market altogether, or should",17
NA,be introduced only under the specified con-,17
NA,"ditions, and what should be the maximum",17
NA,"price at which, such goods might be sold",17
NA,if their importation were permitted. I wish,17
NA,to make it clear that I do not desire to es-,17
NA,tablish a definite price. The intention,17
NA,and object of my amendment is simply to,17
NA,"fix a maximum, ancl below that anything",17
NA,can be done in the way of competition.,17
NA,The maximum would be a figure which,17
NA,might be recognised by the Justice as,17
NA,something beyond which the goods ought,17
NA,"not to go in price, in common reason, and",17
NA,in the ordinary dealings of business people.,17
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,"How , for instance,",17
NA,would the honorable member fix the price,17
NA,of fruit?,17
Mr FOWLER , I do not think,17
NA,'likely that we shall be applying legislation,17
NA,of this kind in connexion with the introof,17
NA,"duction, of fruit.",17
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e price,17
NA,ranges.from 6d. to Â£ 1 per box.,17
Mr FOWLER ,I f it goes up to Â£,17
NA,"per box on that particular :lass of goods,",17
NA,the Justice would have no hesitation in,17
NA,declaring Â£ i per box as the maximum,17
NA,price. I t is easy to express doubt as,17
NA,whether such a 'provision as I propose,17
NA,"workable, but, in my opinion, it is 'quite",17
NA,as workable as are many of the clauses,17
NA,which the Committee has already passed.,17
NA,I believe that this Bill is _ largely,17
NA,indication of future possibilities in,17
NA,"lation of a more effective character, and",17
NA,fact that we emphasize the necessity for,17
NA,protection of the consumers by fixing,17
NA,maximum price will probablv afford some,17
NA,"""basis ""tor future legislation in regard",17
NA,to this very important and necessary,17
NA,phase of protection. I have given some,17
NA,"consideration to the matter, and in view",17
NA,Preservation Bill.,17
NA,of the testimony I have submitted from a,17
NA,"shrewd business man, who has for some",17
NA,time been engaged in work closely con-,17
NA,nected with the kind of operations with,17
NA,"which this Bill deals, I am sure the Com-",17
NA,mittee will give that consideration to my,17
NA,amendment to which it is fairly entitled-,17
NA,in accordance with the principles which,17
NA,have actuated honorable members in deal-,17
NA,ing with the measure.,17
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) [11.16] - I,17
NA,am very glad that the honorable member,17
NA,for Perth has seen fit to propose an amend-,17
NA,ment of this sort. I t is one which I think,17
NA,should receive the :ordial indorsement of,17
NA,every member of the Committee,17
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Wh o is a Socialist,17
Mr CONROY ,I t should certainly re-,17
NA,ceive the support of every member of the,17
NA,"Committee who is a Socialist, but it should",17
NA,also receive the support of every honorable,17
NA,"member who, though he may not be a So-",17
NA,"cialist, still does not desire to see a local'",17
NA,1,17
NA,monopoly created under the provisions of,17
NA,"this Bill, with power to raise prices",17
NA,"against all the consumers in the States, and",17
NA,without any obligation to contribute ap-,17
NA,portion of their profits to the workers in-,17
NA,their employ. This is all that the amend-,17
NA,ment aims at. It practically says only that,17
NA,when competition is declared to be unfair,17
NA,"in the terms of the Bill,. and to come-",17
NA,within the prohibition sections of the Com-,17
NA,monwealth Customs Act-becaus e it must,17
NA,not to be forgotten that under sub-clause 2-,17
NA,it is of clause 18 of this Bill-,17
NA,"The Governor-General may, under the powers",17
NA,"the Customs Act 1901, prohibit the importa-",17
NA,tion of the imported jjoods either absolutely or.,17
NA,of fruit under such conditions-,17
NA,and so on. Honorable members will see-,17
NA,1 that under this provision the Governor-,17
NA,General is given power to absolutely pro-,17
NA,"hibit the importation o'f certain goods, and",17
NA,we may be placing the whole of the con-,17
NA,to sumers throughout Australia at the mercy,17
NA,is of every little local combination that is,17
NA,able to get the provisions of the Bill,17
NA,"put into operation. In the circumstances,",17
NA,it is but right and fair that some regard,17
NA,an should be had to the interests of the great,17
NA,"legismass of the people, and that before any",17
NA,the manufacturer should be able to have the,17
NA,"the Bill put into operation for his benefit, he",17
NA,a should at all events be obliged to disgorge-,17
NA,a portion of the profit he would thus be,17
NA,"enabled to make, and which, but for this-",17
NA,"amendment, he could retain. Failing that,",17
NA,under the amendment he would have to sell',17
NA,"his goods at such a ""fair and reasonable-",17
NA,price that he would not be able to take,18
NA,advantage of an absolutely closed market,18
NA,to raise prices to such an extent that the,18
NA,great bulk of the people would be as,18
NA,effectually prevented from purchasing his,18
NA,goods as i f their manufacture did not,18
NA,exist.,18
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Conro y advocating,18
NA,prohibition !,18
Mr CONROY , I point out that I am,18
NA,supporting this amendment because of the,18
NA,other' provisions of the B i l l . Considering,18
NA,"the spirit of the measure, and dealing",18
NA,"with it in its entirety, I say that it is abso-",18
NA,lutely necessary to have some guarantee,18
NA,"that the Bil l shall be what, on the face of",18
NA,"it, i t purports to be, but what it is not at",18
NA,"the present time, a measure to safeguard",18
NA,"the interests of the workers and consumers,",18
NA,and not merely those o'f the manufacturers.,18
NA,A provision such as that contained,18
NA,"in the amendment, would no doubt",18
NA,tend to bring about some spirit of,18
NA,fairness on the part of manufacturers.,18
NA,They would not appeal as readily to,18
NA,the provisions of the measure when they,18
NA,-found that a share of the profit they,18
NA,would otherwise make must go to the con-,18
NA,sumers o'f the articles they manufacture.,18
NA,"""Under the circumstances, I",18
NA,hesitation in supporting the amendment.,18
NA,I can quote excellent precedents for it . One,18
NA,"is an English Act of 1368; and', in this con-",18
NA,"nexion, I foreshadowed my present inten-",18
NA,tion by giving notice of an amendment.,18
NA,Thi s English Act provided that the Justice,18
NA,"-should, on the motion of any person, as-",18
NA,sess the prices at which articles must be,18
NA,"-sold, so that the manufacturer should have",18
NA,"""reasonable gains and no more."" I t is the Tat-",18
NA,ter part of that provision that I quote lite-,18
NA,"Tally, as it provides for fair prices. By that",18
NA,"English Act, however, a manufacturer was",18
NA,liable to a penalty i f he did not observe the,18
NA,"prices fixed; and here, it will be observed,",18
NA,there is an omission in the clause under,18
NA,-consideration. The English Act provided,18
NA,that any manufacturer who refused to,18
NA,accept the prices assessed should be liable,18
NA,to a penalty of Â£ TOO for each offence;,18
NA,and a similar provision in the Bill would,18
NA,put an end to much sham patriotism.,18
NA,When manufacturers found that the profits,18
NA,"were not likelv to go into their own pockets,",18
NA,but to go into the pockets of the work-,18
NA,"men, their anxiety for Parliament to",18
NA,meddle would sensiblv diminish; and it,18
NA,would be desirable to bring an end to the,18
NA,log-rolling in which some of the manu-,18
NA,facturers endeavour to indulge - I regard,18
NA,an amendment of this character as vitally,18
NA,necessary. Another precedent is afforded,18
NA,"in an English Act of 1532, whereby the",18
NA,mayors of 'boroughs and the rulers of,18
NA,counties and shires were called upon to,18
NA,assess the prices at which meat and other,18
NA,victuals should be sold. I n the following,18
NA,"year, however, the butchers complained",18
NA,"that the graziers, breeders, and drovers",18
NA,would not sell the cattle at such prices,18
NA,"as enabled the retailers to get "" reason-",18
NA,"able gains, and no more.""",18
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I S there not an,18
NA,English Act of about the same period re-,18
NA,lating to the sale of herrings?,18
Mr CONROY ,Th e Act relating to,18
NA,herrings was passed in the fifteenth cen-,18
NA,"tury, and dealt with forestalling. When",18
NA,the butchers complained of the action of,18
NA,"the graziers, breeders, and drovers, an",18
NA,Act was passed i n 1538 providing that any,18
NA,"breeder, grazier, or drover who refused to",18
NA,sell stock at reasonable prices should ap-,18
NA,"pear before the Justices, and that the",18
NA,"latter should thereupon appoint "" i n d i f -",18
NA,"ferent men ""-tha t is disinterested' men-",18
NA,"to assess the prices. I f the breeder,",18
NA,"grazier, or drover refused to sell at the",18
NA,prices assessed he was haled before the,18
NA,have no,18
NA,"Star Chamber, there to await the pleasure",18
NA,of King's Counsel.,18
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Thing s seem to,18
NA,have been much the same in those days as,18
NA,at the present day.,18
NA,Mr HuGHEjs -Th e honorable and,18
NA,learned member for Werriwa has forgotten,18
NA,to mention the fixed prices for food in,18
NA,San Francisco recently.,18
Mr CONROY ,Ther e was an earth-,18
NA,quake in San Francisco. The Minister,18
NA,in charge of the B i l l ought to make fur-,18
NA,ther provision to meet the case of manu-,18
NA,facturers who choose to work onlv half,18
NA,"time, or take any other action of the sort.",18
NA,Legislation of this class ought to be carried,18
NA,right through to its logical conclusions.,18
NA,I f the premises are such as to lead to ab-,18
NA,"surd conclusions, the fault is not ours,",18
NA,but is that of those who assert the premises.,18
NA,This Bill is said to be in the interests,18
NA,"cf the workers, and amendments to that",18
NA,end ought to be accepted. Nobodv can,18
NA,contend that this amendment would not,18
NA,be in the interests of the workers and,18
NA,"the consumers, or that it would in anv way",18
NA,prevent the manufacturer from appealing,18
NA,to the Court i f he thought he was suffering,18
NA,"injury. Indeed a manufacturer, who was",18
NA,"acting from purely patriotic motives, and",18
NA,who intended to divide the profits with his,19
NA,"workers, would appeal to the Court with",19
NA,additional strength.,19
Mr MCWILLIAMS , N o t many manufac-,19
NA,turers would appeal to the Court under,19
NA,such circumstances.,19
Mr CONROY ,Tha t may be; but we,19
NA,must not introduce legislation solely on be-,19
NA,half of two or three particular individuals.,19
NA,We must take care that consumers are not,19
NA,"mulcted in extra prices, as they would be",19
NA,"under prohibition provisions; at all events,",19
NA,we should take care that any extra prices,19
NA,"or profits do not all go to the capitalist, but",19
NA,are distributed amongst the workers en-,19
NA,gaged in the production of the particular,19
NA,articles. The amendment would necessi-,19
NA,tate a further amendment. I n order to pre-,19
NA,vent a manufacturer declaring that he had,19
NA,alreadv sold all his goods,19
NA,The' CHAIRMAN -Th e,19
NA,member must not anticipate an amendment.,19
Mr CONROY ,T o put myself in order,19
NA,I shall add the consequential amendment.,19
NA,I n this connexion I intend to use the exact,19
NA,words of the celebrated English Act of,19
NA,1368 in relation to forestalling.,19
NA,"were, of course, earlier English Acts of the",19
NA,"kind, such as that provided for assizes to",19
NA,"fix the prices of bread, corn, and ale.",19
Mr WILSON ,Wha t was the price of,19
NA,ale?,19
Mr CONROY ,I n those days four gal-,19
NA,lons of ale could be bought for a penny.,19
Mr GLYNN ,On e could get chops and,19
NA,tomato sauce f o r about i Â£ d . in those days !,19
Mr CONROY , A pig could then be,19
NA,bought for 4d. I have already read the,19
NA,words of the English Act i n regard to,19
NA,"forestalling, but, as some honorable mem-",19
NA,"bers were not present when I did so, I",19
NA,shall read them again.,19
The CHAIRMAN , T h a t would be,19
NA,"tedious repetition, the honorable member",19
NA,having alreadv read the words.,19
Mr CONROY , I have not quoted the,19
NA,words in connexion with this clause.,19
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e,19
NA,member read the words a few moments ago.,19
Mr CONROY ,No ; what I propose to,19
NA,read now is another section of the English,19
NA,Act. which is directly consequential on the,19
NA,addition to the amendment suggested,19
NA,by me. I t is not my fault i f the logical,19
NA,conclusions of such legislation as that now,19
NA,V f c -p us is not palatable to members of,19
NA,the Ministry. We should prevent a manu-,19
NA,"facturer from saying "" I have sold all my",19
NA,"goods."" and so escaping tlie operation of the",19
NA,very clause which we have inserted in the,19
NA,"Bill. The words, the insertion of which I",19
NA,"intend to move, will be somewhat as fol-",19
NA,lows :-,19
NA,Any forestaller which is an open oppressor,19
NA,of poor people and an enemy of the whole' Com-,19
NA,"monwealth, which for greediness of his private",19
NA,gain buyeth in advance such things intending to,19
NA,"sell them more dear, shall be liable to \",19
NA,penalty of ^.'500.,19
Mr WEBSTER ,"Wh y not say "" imprison-",19
NA,"ment for life "" ?",19
Mr CONROY ,"Th e honorable member,",19
NA,"with his views on coercion, might be",19
NA,"ready to support such a proposal, but I",19
NA,will be more moderate and fix only a mone-,19
NA,tary penaltyto be paid by the manufac-,19
NA,turer. As the money will remain in the,19
NA,"country, the fine will not injure him, from",19
NA,his point of view.,19
The CHAIRMAN , I must remind the,19
NA,honorable honorable member that he moved a similar,19
NA,"amendment last night, and that it was",19
NA,negatived. He cannot re-open that ques-,19
NA,tion.,19
Mr CONROY ,The n a loophole will,19
NA,There be left for the escape of offenders. For,19
NA,the reasons which I have given I have no,19
NA,hesitation in supporting the amendment of,19
NA,the honorable member for Perth. I t com-,19
NA,mends itself to me as much more logical,19
NA,than any of the clauses already in the B i l l .,19
NA,I f it were proposed apart from a measure,19
NA,".of this kind, it is quite possible that some",19
NA,of us would not be able to support it. but,19
NA,as we are dealing with a Bill of this kind,19
NA,it is incumbent upon us to make it as effec-,19
NA,tive as possible. Although I am in opposi-,19
NA,"tion, I recognise that when a Bill has",19
NA,passed its second reading and pets into,19
NA,"Committee, it is our duty to make it as",19
NA,consistent and logical with its own prin-,19
NA,ciples as we can.,19
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,North,19
NA,Sydney) [11.34] - I must admit at,19
NA,once that the amendment of the honorable,19
NA,member for Perth embodies a logical ex-,19
NA,honorable tension of the principles of this measure.,19
NA,But as I have already opposed clauses,19
NA,in the measure which I think ridicu-,19
NA,"lous, I am not going to support an amend-",19
NA,ment which will make it more ridiculous.,19
NA,That it is impossible of application,19
NA,the honorable member will himself recog-,19
NA,nise when I give an instance. Suppose an,19
NA,importer has a canrp o f tea.. No importer,19
NA,expects to obtain an exactly even profit on,19
NA,the different lines of tea in a cargo. Its,19
NA,nualitv depends largely on the season in,19
NA,the country from which it is procured.,19
Mr FOWLER ,Bu t we do not produce,20
NA,tea in Australia.,20
NA,Mr DUGALDTHOMS d N - There are,20
NA,many other commodities which we do probe,20
NA,"duce. We produce coffee, for instance.",20
Mr FOWLER ,Th e amendment would,20
NA,work very well in the case of harvesters.,20
Mr DUGALD THOMSON , I t might,20
NA,in that instance. The importer might find,20
NA,that he had to sell a portion of his cargo,20
NA,"at a loss, some at cost, and some at a",20
NA,profit. His net profit would depend upon,20
NA,the whole operation. But apart from that,20
NA,"argument, I would ask honorable members",20
NA,to recollect that the deputy leader of the,20
NA,Opposition has given an undertaking to,20
NA,try to get this measure through this afterprevent,20
NA,"noon. Therefore, we should not prolong",20
NA,the debate on amendments which can lead,20
NA,to nothing.,20
Mr CONROY , I am thoroughly in accould,20
NA,cord with the amendment i f this Bill is,20
NA,be passed.,20
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,"A t any """,20
NA,"rate, we ought to get to a division as soon",20
NA,as possible.,20
Mr LONSDALE ,New England),20
NA,[11.36] - I must admit at once that,20
NA,"amendment, no matter how sillv it may be,",20
NA,is the logical outcome of the Bill. As,20
NA,measure proposes not only to protect the,20
NA,"manufacturer, but as the hvpocritical",20
NA,pretence behind it is that it is intended,20
NA,"also to protect the worker ancl consumer,",20
NA,we should take care that the consumer,20
NA,effectually protected. I do not believe,20
NA,"this kind of legislation, but i f , on the",20
NA,"side, we are going to prevent competition,",20
NA,then we ought to fix what is a fair,20
NA,"price, we should take care of the other",20
NA,also. I do not quite agree with the terms,20
NA,"of the amendment, which, apparently, method. '",20
NA,fixes the prices of imported goods. I,20
NA,gest that the price inside at which all,20
NA,factured goods are to be sold should,20
NA,fixed. We should prevent manufacturers,20
NA,"from getting, by the aid of this B i l l",20
NA,creased prices. Whv should we,20
NA,the power of manufacturers to obtain just,20
NA,"what prices they like ? The Minister, on [ 1 1 . 4 3 ]",20
NA,"a former occasion, has accepted evidence",20
NA,"from competitors as to the price of goods, of this country.",20
NA,"and, on ex parte statements, has increased",20
NA,the price for Customs purposes.,20
NA,"should clip his angelic wings a little,",20
NA,"should, at any rate. prevent that",20
NA,"kind of thing occurring in ""future.",20
NA,"When prices have to be fixed, the",20
NA,matter should come before Parliament.,20
NA,And i f we can fix the price of goods,20
NA,"means of a duty, or in any other way, why",20
NA,should we not fix it positively ? Why,20
NA,"should not a Court, where evidence could",20
NA,"taken from all sides, have the right to",20
NA,fix the price?,20
Mr DUGALD THOMSON , Would the,20
NA,honorable member have the Court fixing the,20
NA,price to-day and changing it to-morrow ?,20
Mr LONSDALE ,Yes . Let us keep,20
NA,the Justice sitting to fix the price every,20
NA,good day. I am against this kind of legisla-,20
NA,"tion, because, it is'absolutely absurd. The",20
NA,pretence is that the Bill is intended to help,20
NA,:,20
NA,the consumers and workers. We have in-,20
NA,"serted a provision to help'the workers, and",20
NA,why should we not insert a provision to,20
NA,manufacturers from charging ex-,20
NA,treme prices ? The particular friends of,20
NA,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, in",20
NA,"whose interest the Bill has been introduced,",20
NA,insist upon the price of harvesters,20
NA,to being kept at the very highest point. Why-,20
NA,"should we not say to these manufacturers,",20
NA,You must sell your goods at a certain,20
NA,"price, or you shall not get any relief under",20
NA,"the Act "" ? Is there anything, wrong in",20
NA,"doing that ? I f there is, then the Bill is",20
NA,"this wrong all through. Of coiuse, the Min-",20
NA,"ister has his idea, and that is to help the",20
NA,the rich against the poor. Outside and inside,20
NA,the House he poses as a great lover of the,20
NA,poor. But in every act he keeps his eye,20
NA,"upon the wealthy, and does not care a",20
NA,straw as to what may become of the con-,20
NA,"is sumers or the workmen, so long as his",20
NA,"in special friends, the manufacturers, can be",20
NA,"one helped. With that alteration, I feel very",20
NA,"much inclined to support the amendment,",20
NA,"not because I believe in it, but because I",20
NA,"side consider that, i f we are going to help",20
NA,"everybody, we should try' to adopt the best",20
NA,I admit that we cannot by law,20
NA,"sughelp everybody; but, as some classes of",20
NA,"manuthe community believe that certain words,",20
NA,"be when printed upon a piece of paper, can",20
NA,make persons rich and help the commu-,20
NA,", innity, we might as well try to do so fn this",20
NA,put i t in direction as in anv other.,20
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,Robertson),20
NA,- I regard this proposal as .im-,20
NA,practicable as applying to the general trade,20
NA,The honorable and,20
NA,"learned member for Werriwa was, I think,",20
NA,We ironical. He cannot possibly agree with,20
NA,and this proposal to determine what shall he,20
NA,"the fair selling price o'f goods, i f he calls",20
NA,"to mind the definition of "" probably "" given",20
NA,"by the Attorney-General, namelv, that be-",20
NA,fore the goods get into circulation they,20
NA,by shall be seized i f they would probably,20
NA,destroy trade. The Bill is complete in its,21
NA,effort to interfere with trade; but what,21
NA,wouid a Justice .know of general commerce,21
NA,to enable him to determine the price of,21
NA,goods ?,21
Mr LEE ,Wha t would he know about,21
NA,unfair competition ?,21
Mr HENRY WILLIS , Nothing at,21
NA,all. A Justice knows nothing about com-,21
NA,mercial affairs. This duty should be in-,21
NA,"trusted to an expert commercial man, or to",21
NA,"a board of experts permanently appointed,",21
NA,and removed from political influence.,21
Mr MCWILLIAMS , Would the honor-,21
NA,able member like to be tried by a jury of,21
NA,experts ?,21
Mr HENRY WILLIS , I would much,21
NA,sooner be tried by an expert than by an,21
NA,ignorant person. The proposal to deter-,21
NA,mine the price of goods is absolutely ab-,21
NA,surd. Under the Bill the goods would be,21
NA,"impounded. The use of the word "" prob-",21
NA,"ably "" would really be an inducement to",21
NA,"incompetent persons to operate, because",21
NA,"they would say, "" The goods will then be",21
NA,"set free, and we can determine the price,",21
NA,possibly with the assistance of the Comp-,21
NA,"troller-General of Customs.""",21
Mr LONSDALE , I would not allow the,21
NA,Comptroller-General to act.,21
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,No ; but he is,21
NA,already authorized by the Bill to act. With,21
NA,"a majority at their backs, the Government",21
NA,can do what they like. But I shall be no,21
NA,party to a proposal to interfere with trade,21
NA,in such a way as is indicated in the amend-,21
NA,ment. I t is not an improvement upon the,21
NA,"proposals of the Government, because it",21
NA,would offer an inducement to the deciding,21
NA,"authorities to act. They would say, "" The",21
NA,hardship will be minimized i f we determine,21
NA,"the price""- a thing which they would be",21
NA,absolutely unfit to do. Admitting that a,21
NA,man may be most competent as a Jus-,21
NA,"tice of the High Court, he may still be",21
NA,quite incompetent to fill a position in which,21
NA,he would have to deal with trade. And a,21
NA,man who is experienced in only one line,21
NA,of trade would not be competent to d s-,21
NA,charge the duty. I t could only be pro-,21
NA,perly performed bv one who had a,21
NA,"general knowledge of trade and commerce,",21
NA,"3. very wide experience, and very long",21
NA,standing in more than one country. I can,21
NA,not possibly support the amendment.,21
Mr FOWLER ,Th e Justice could call,21
NA,"expert evidence, and have access to the",21
NA,books o'f all those concerned.,21
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,-No . I think,21
NA,that the honorable member pointed out an,21
NA,instance in which it might work. I t is ad-,21
NA,mitted to be practicable as regards certain,21
NA,"classes of machinery, where the selling price",21
NA,"in the country of production, and the selling",21
NA,price in the importing country are known.,21
NA,But when we come to think of the million,21
NA,and one manufactures the prices of which,21
NA,might have to be determined iby the Justice,21
NA,"or the Comptroller-General, we must see",21
NA,that the proposal is impracticable.,21
Mr JOHNSON ,Lang) [11.47] - I do,21
NA,not agree altogether with the opinions ex-,21
NA,pressed by the honorable member 'for,21
NA,Robertson in regard to the amendment. I t,21
NA,seems to me that i f it is fair to legislate,21
NA,for the purpose of protecting the pro-,21
NA,fits of the local manufacturers by,21
NA,limiting competition-an d I disagree,21
NA,with the contention that it is-the n,21
NA,"it is equally right, by similar legisla-",21
NA,"tion, to seek to limit the power of a local",21
NA,manufacturer to raise the price of his,21
NA,goods to the public. The purpose o'f the,21
NA,amendment is to prevent the local manu-,21
NA,"facturer, when once he has secured a",21
NA,"monopoly, .from unduly raising the prices",21
NA,"beyond what the Court-which , I suppose,",21
NA,will be the deciding body-ma y deem to be,21
NA,fair and reasonable. I quite agree with,21
NA,the honorable member for New England,21
NA,and the honorable and learned member for,21
NA,"Werriwa, that all legislation of this",21
NA,character is mischievous and dangerous.,21
NA,"But i f we are to have such legislation, let",21
NA,us see that we protect everybody all round.,21
NA,"I f the manufacturer is to be protected, the",21
NA,wage-earner should also be protected. We,21
NA,"must see that he shall get his "" cut"" out",21
NA,"of the benefits oif the monopoly, and also",21
NA,"that the public, who, after all, are the",21
NA,"principal persons to be considered, shall",21
NA,not be made to pay unduly through the,21
NA,nose for the benefits which have been con-,21
NA,ferred upon the manufacturers. Although',21
NA,I do not believe in the principle of the,21
NA,"amendment, as a principle generally, still,",21
NA,as it is operating all through the Bill for,21
NA,the purpose of protecting other sections of,21
NA,"; the community, it is about time that the in-",21
NA,terests of the public were considered. I t,21
NA,"is, I admit, a late hour at which to con-",21
NA,"sider them, but the amendment certainly",21
NA,makes an effort to recognise that there is,21
NA,"a public to be considered, and to have its",21
NA,pocket protected against undue onslaughts,21
NA,by local monopolists. For that reason. I,21
NA,(feel inclined to support the amendment.,21
NA,I desire to call the attention of the hon-,21
NA,orable member for New England to the,21
NA,fact that he seems to have read the clause,21
NA,"a little wrongly, because he assumed that",22
NA,the amendment is for the purpose of regu-,22
NA,lating the price of the imported article.,22
Mr LONSDALE ,Tha t is how it strikes,22
NA,me.,22
Mr JOHNSON ,"As' a matter of fact,",22
NA,it is for the purpose of regulating the price,22
NA,of goods protected under this provision;,22
NA,"that is to say, locally-produced goods.",22

Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [12.13] -Th e,23
NA,Minister declares that his aversion to the,23

Sir WILLIAM LYNE ," N o , I said that it",23

Mr KELLY , W e all recognise that it,23
NA,that the honorable would be extremely difficult for a workman,23
NA,to bring the Act into operation. But i f,23
NA,I f a number the Minister will scrutinize its provisions,23
NA,carefully he will find that the Bill itself,23
NA,affords a sufficient answer to his fears.,23
NA,"Clause 14 defines "" unfair competition "" -",23
NA,which is the essential element underlving,23
NA,the commencement of any action-a s some-,23

NA,the Government will not act upon mere as-,24
NA,sumption. They will act only upon some,24
NA,"bond fide assurance, and that assurance can",24
NA,only properly emanate from the manufac-,24

Mr MCWILLIAMS ,I f they,24

Mr KELLY ,Exactly . The object of,24

NA,"luctance to accept the amendment, but now",24
NA,that he recognises that under tlie Bill the,24

NA,"purmay depend on the decision, and I point",25

NA,"occasional, but, even from the Minister's",26
NA,"of stand-point, continuous. I f appeal were",26
NA,"allowed, it would only mean that, for a",26
NA,"little time, the party concerned would have",26
NA,"may to continue his business under bond, and",26
NA,then the Court would finally settle the,26
Mr ISAACS , I can quite see that the,26
NA,difficulty mentioned might arise under the,26
NA,d proposed new sub-clause 7.,26
Mr DUGALD THOMSON , I must,26
NA,say that I do not place so much importance,26
NA,on the point in connexion with the proposed,26
NA,"new sub-clause 2, but I thought I would",26
NA,be mention the matter now. The amendments,26
NA,are so complicated that one is apt to get,26
NA,but I would point out that the,26
NA,decision may mean the forfeiture of the,26
NA,under clause 16. Under the Customs,26
NA,"Act there are certain prohibited gdods, and",26
NA,the Bill includes the provisions of that Act.,26
NA,Section 229 of the Customs Act declares,26
NA,that certain goods shall be forfeited.,26
Mr ISAACS ,A n appeal to the Court,26
NA,that would not affect clause r6.,26
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Bu t the,26
NA,seriousness of the matters involved make it,26
NA,desirable to have the power to appeal.,26
NA,the provisions of the Customs Act,26
NA,are the goods might be absolutely forfeited.,26
NA,The more importart ouestion as to unfair,26
NA,"should, I think, also be sub-",26
NA,"ject to appeal, i f the party affected takes",26
NA,the great risk of giving bonds to cover his,26
NA,without enbusiness in the meantime.,26
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [12.48] - I think,26
NA,the proposed new sub-clause 3 ought,26
NA,not to stand. We have passed clauses,26
NA,under which the opinion of the Judge,26
NA,or the Comptroller-General establishes,26
NA,find the fact of unfair competition. The,26
NA,Comptroller-General mav be of opinion,26
NA,"that unfair competition exists, and when",26
NA,"the question is sent on, the Judge",26
NA,is to have the power to determine that it,26
NA,"to does exist; in other words, the slightest",26
NA,possible evidence will justify the Judge,26
NA,"in expressing that opinion, which no one",26
NA,can possibly challenge. Notwithstanding,26
NA,we give this tremendous power to the,26
NA,"Tudge, we sav that every allegation in",26
NA,dethe certificate shall be 'deemed to be,26
NA,"correct. That is not"" consistent with, the",26
NA,would ordinary methods of proof. By clause,26
NA,1,26
NA,15 we provide that the certificate must,27
NA,"contain certain statements, including one",27
NA,that the goods are being imported with the,27
NA,intention to destroy Australian industry.,27
Mr ISAACS ,No .,27
Mr GLYNN , I beg the Attorney-,27
NA,General's pardon.,27
Mr ISAACS ,Wil l the honorable and,27
NA,learned member look at,27
Mr GLYNN , I know perfectly - well,27
NA,that the Attorney-General is going to refer,27
NA,me to sub-clause 2.,27
Mr ISAACS ,Yes .,27
Mr GLYNN , I do not think that sub-,27
NA,clause is at all exhaustive.,27
NA,"particularly clever Bill, and we have to",27
NA,be cautious.,27
Mr ISAACS , I have no objection to,27
NA,"add to the proposed new sub-clause 3, the",27
NA,"words "" required by sub-section 2 of section",27
Mr GLYNN ,No t only the matters in,27
NA,this sub-clause 2 which the Attorney-Gene-,27
NA,ral now thinks ought to be the limit of this,27
NA,"-prima facie evidence, but also the matters",27
NA,"specified in. sub-clause 1, which contain the",27
NA,"whole gist of these provisions, are pre-",27
NA,"sumed to be correct, no matter how ela-",27
NA,"borate and exhaustive they; may be, unless",27
NA,the importer can show that the evidence,27
NA,concerning any one of them is false. I t,27
NA,will be exceedingly difficult for the im-,27
NA,porter to counteract the effect of that prima,27
NA,facie presumption. He will not only have,27
NA,"to give evidence, but will have to go into",27
NA,the matter of foreign prices in foreign mar-,27
NA,"kets, fair rates of wages, and I do not",27
NA,know what. Not only should we amend,27
NA,the clause in the direction suggested by the,27
NA,"Attorney-General, so as to confine its ope-",27
NA,ration to sub-clause 2-whic h is a consider-,27
NA,able limitation-bu t even with that amend-,27

NA,The Justice shall forward his,28
NA,"to the Minister, who shall, &c.",28
NA,Since I gave notice of my intention to,28
NA,"move this amendment, there has been a",28
NA,"very important alteration made, and that is",28
NA,the substitution of a Justice of the High,28
NA,Court for the Board. But I still believe,28
NA,that the object and purpose of the mea-,28
NA,sure would have been much more effect-,28
NA,ively and fairly secured i f the course I am,28
NA,"now suggesting had been adopted, even",28
NA,without the intervention of the Justice.,28
NA,As soon as the receipt of the certificate of,28
NA,the Comptroller-General had been acknow-,28
NA,ledged' by .the Minister it should have,28
NA,placed an obligation upon the latter to at,28
NA,once consult Parliament i f sitting.,28
NA,"i f it be not sitting, I venture to suggest that",28
NA,the procedure proposed under a Justice will,28
NA,occupy a considerable time. No inspector,28
NA,can be at the beck and call of the Comp-,28
NA,troller-General or Minister; he mav be in,28
NA,another part of the Commonwealth ; and,28
NA,consequently there may be a long in-,28
NA,terval before a decision can be obtained.,28
NA,[12.59] - I I hold that a similar objection will apply,28
NA,to the employment of a Justice. I do,28
NA,not think that there should be any oppo-,28
NA,sition offered to the amendment on that,28
NA,ground. I would remind the Minister,28
NA,that the Bill is intended to deal with ex-,28
NA,traordinary conditions. The Attorney-,28
NA,General has stated that he regards the,28
NA,Tariff as dealing with ordinary importa-,28
NA,"or, tions, bub this B i l l as dealing with extra-",28
NA,ordinary importations. I may be told that,28
NA,the Minister would always be responsible,28
NA,"to Parliament, and that it would always be",28
NA,open to it to dissent from his action. But,28
NA,"that argument, I submit, does not properly",28
NA,"apply here, inasmuch as there may reason-",28
NA,ably be a diversity of opinion on a sub-,28
NA,ject of this magnitude. I earnestly hope,28
NA,that this fair and just proposal may re-,28
NA,ceive serious consideration from the Min-,28
NA,ister. He perhaps still adheres to his view,28
NA,"that, after representations have been made",28
NA,and justified before a Justice of the High,28
NA,"Court, importations which may be of great",28
NA,"magnitude may be justly prohibited, and",28
NA,that there is no justification for the posi-,28
NA,tion I have taken up. But I earnestly sub-,28
NA,mit that there is a' serious responsibility,28
NA,placed upon the Minister as to the manner,28
NA,"in which the Bill shall be applied, and",28
NA,that anv suggestion is worthy of considera-,28
NA,tion. I understand that a distinct promise,28
NA,has been given by the Opposition to push,28
NA,the B i l l through its Committee stage to-,28
NA,"day. Therefore, I do not propose to deal",28
NA,determination exhaustively with the subject-matter of,28
NA,"the amendment, or to show to what extent",28
NA,restraint of trade may be involved. I t is a,28
NA,tremendous power which is being given to,28
NA,the Minister. I think that even with the re-,28
NA,"ference to the Justice, i t will be found to",28
NA,be rather complicated and expensive,28
NA,machinery; and to entail enormous hardship,28
NA,upon certain importers. I submitÂ°that in-,28
NA,asmuch as the Ministry has - substantially,28
NA,affirmed that the object of the Bill is to,28
NA,"deal with extraordinary conditions, we are",28
NA,justified in asking that Parliament should,28
NA,be afforded an opportunity of considering,28
NA,extraordinary determinations of t h e . M i n-,28
NA,ister. Every item of the Tariff had to be,28
NA,"But approved bv both Houses, and surely when",28
NA,drastic action is taken by the Minister in,28
NA,regard to certain imports his determination,28
NA,ought to be subject to review by the same,28
NA,tribunal. I sincerelv believe that i f the,28
NA,"amendment is adopted, it is likely to im-",28
NA,prove the condition of things. I t is not,28
NA,submitted out of anv feeling of hostility to,28
NA,the principle underlying the measure. I f,28
NA,"the Bill is seriously applied, even with the",29
NA,numerous alterations which have been,29
NA,"made, and the concessions which have been",29
NA,"secured, I fear that serious consequences",29
NA,may result. Parliament is the expression,29
NA,"of the will of the people, and it should, I",29
NA,"think, be called in as arbitrator in a matter",29
NA,of this importance.,29
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta),29
NA,"[2.9] - I rise to support the amendment,",29
NA,which I hope will be agreed to. I t has a,29
NA,great deal more importance than appears on,29
NA,the surface. For the first time in the his-,29
NA,"tory of a British Parliament, there is a de-",29
NA,liberate proposal: to put the power of pro-,29
NA,hibiting trade outside Parliament. I see,29
NA,nothing inconsistent with the machinery,29
NA,providing for full and fair inquiry by a,29
NA,"Justice with all the powers of a Court, thus",29
NA,"guaranteeing a disinterested, impartial, and",29
NA,thorough sifting of all the facts concerning,29
NA,allegations of dumping. That will be an,29
NA,"advantage, I have no doubt, because when",29
NA,"we receive such evidence from the Justice,",29
NA,it will be practically the last word as to the,29
NA,substantiality of the facts alleged or other-,29
NA,"wise. Therefore, I think that instead of",29
NA,leaving the matter for the final determina-,29
NA,"tion of a Justice, we ought to reserve to",29
NA,ourselves the right to determine whether,29
NA,goods shall be prohibited from entering,29
NA,the Commonwealth even though they may,29
NA,be subject to the Tariff impositions,29
NA,which Parliament has already provided for.,29
NA,"We have established trading, relations with",29
NA,"other parts of the British Empire, and with",29
NA,"the rest of the world, meeting differences in",29
NA,"skill, advancement, numbers, or efficiency",29
NA,between our workmen and their competitors,29
NA,"by the imposition of duties,. But it is now",29
NA,proposed to hand over to the Minister the,29
NA,"rigjit to arbitrarily prohibit importation,",29
NA,without-the necessity of consulting Parlia-,29
NA,ment in the matter. This is the first time,29
NA,that the giving of such power to the Min-,29
NA,ister has been suggested. Parliament should,29
NA,not let this power leave its hands. I f it,29
NA,"does, it fritters away the sovereign control",29
NA,with which it is invested. I hope that the,29

NA,goods are being imported with the,30
NA,effect of benefiting the primary pro-,30
NA,"ducers of the Commonwealth.""",30
NA,One of the reasons given for the introduc-,30
NA,tion of this Bill was that a combine of,30
NA,agricultural implement makers might be,30
NA,formed with the object of ruthlessly de-,30
NA,"stroying the Australian industry, and after-",30
NA,wards of inordinately increasing the price,30
NA,of their manufactures' for the purpose of,30
NA,"fleecing the agriculturists. Personally, I",30
NA,have never entertained the slightest fear of,30
NA,"*5 anything of the kind, and there has not",30
NA,AVES. been a tittle of evidence adduced in sup-,30
NA,"port of it. I regard the plough, the har-",30
NA,"row, and the seed drill as the tools of trade",30
NA,of the farmer. I f Australia is ever to pro-,30
NA,"gress, it must be by attracting a rural popu-",30
NA,lation.,30
Mr WILKS ,Ar e these implements,30
NA,made in Great Britaini?,30
Mr MCWILLIAMS ,Yes ; they are,30
NA,NOES. manufactured there very largely. Austra-,30
NA,lia can only progress by the settlement,30
NA,of the people upon the land.,30
NA,"That -fact is generally admitted, but I",30
NA,notice that any proposal to directly assist,30
NA,the agriculturists usually meets with very,30
NA,little sympathy in this House. We hare-,30
NA,only to look at the enormous improvements,30
NA,which have been made in farming imple-,30
NA,ments during the past decade to recognise-,30
NA,the necessity .which exists for the insertion-,30
NA,of the amendment which I have submitted.,30
NA,Ten years ago the position of the agricul-,30
NA,turists was very different from what it is-,30
NA,to-day. Since then all sorts of labour-,30
NA,PAIRS.,30
NA,saving appliances have been introduced.,30
NA,"For example, a better crop can be obtained",30
NA,"to-day by means of the seed drill, using",30
NA,"only half the. quantity of seed, than could",30
NA,be procured under the old method of sow-,30
NA,ing broadcast. Year by year further im-,30
NA,provements are being effected. We know,30
NA,that at the present time enormous rewards,31
NA,are being offered in America for labour-,31
NA,saving appliances in connexion with cotton-,31
NA,"picking, and i f Australia is ever to become",31
NA,"a cotton-producing country, it must be",31
NA,either toy the use of very cheap labour-,31
NA,which none of us' wish to see employed-,31
NA,or by the use of the most up-to-date machi-,31
NA,nery. I believe that the employment of,31
NA,labour-saving appliances would probably,31
NA,solve the problem which is to-day presented,31
NA,by our Northern Teritory tov enabling us to,31
NA,successfully cultivate tropical products.,31
NA,Agricultural machinery is at present in a,31
NA,state of evolution. The machine which was,31
NA,perfect last year may next year be out of,31
NA,date. In the United States and Canada,31
NA,"especially, the enormous fortunes acquired",31
NA,by great implement makers are being util-,31
NA,ized for the one purpose of steadily im-,31
NA,proving their machinery. So far as many,31
NA,"of our primary producers are concerned,",31
NA,Ave must recollect that they have to face the,31
NA,markets of the world with their surplus,31
NA,"products. Our wheat, butter, and fruit",31
NA,have to compete with countries which em-,31
NA,ploy the most up-to-date machinery. No,31
NA,Tariff can possibly assist them. I f our,31
NA,"farmers are to increase their export trade,",31
NA,it can only be by the use of the best,31
NA,labour-saving appliances obtainable. I am,31
NA,aware that a clause has already been in-,31
NA,"serted in the measure which, to some ex-",31
NA,"tent, protects the manufacturer. But i f",31
NA,"we pass the Bill in its present form, it",31
NA,will be within the power of those who are,31
NA,engaged in the manufacture of out-of-date,31
NA,machinery to hold up the importation of,31
NA,"the most modern labour-saving appliances,",31
NA,and thus to place our agriculturalists,31
NA,under an enormous disadvantage.,31

Mr LONSDALE ,New England) [2.40].,31
NA,- I am in favour of the amendment of the,31
NA,amendment proposed by the honorable,31
NA,member for Franklin.,31
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I rise to a point of,31
NA,order. I submit that the amendment,31
NA,of the amendment just proposed by,31
NA,the Minister of Trade and Customs cannot,31
NA,be submitted. An amendment moved by the,31
NA,"honorable gentleman is under discussion,",31
NA,and he cannot more to amend an amend-,31
NA,ment of that amendment until it has been,31
NA,dealt with.,31
The CHAIRMAN , The Minister is,31
NA,quite in order in moving the amendment of,31
NA,the amendment.,31
Mr LONSDALE , I was about to say,31
NA,when the deputy leader of the Opposition,31
NA,"rose to a point of order, that the attitude",31
NA,of the Ministry would be more honest i f,31
NA,they simply negatived the amendment,31
NA,"of the amendment, instead of pro-",31
NA,posing the addition of other words.,31
NA,"If that course were adopted, we",31
NA,should have a fair straight-out vote on the,31
NA,honorable member for Franklin's proposal.,31
NA,Let us consider for a moment what would,31
NA,be the effect of passing the amendment of,31
NA,the amendment in the form now proposed,31
NA,by the Minister. Experiments with a view,31
NA,to the improvement of agricultural machi-,31
NA,nery are being made month after month,31
NA,and year after year. I t is only a little,31
NA,while since complaint was made to the,31
NA,Minister that so-called foreigners were con-,31
NA,ducting a. trial of disc ploughs with the ob-,31
NA,ject of discovering the improvements neces-,31
NA,sary to secure a machine best suited to the,31
NA,various soils of the country. I f an im-,31
NA,proved plough on this pattern were sought,31
NA,"to be introduced, the Minister, under his",31
NA,"further amendment of the amendment,",31
NA,would be able to prevent its importation.,31
NA,We should desire to give free play to the,31
NA,improved machinery which comes here from,31
NA,"other countries, instead of seeking to pre-",31
NA,vent its importation because our own,31
NA,manufacturers do not keep pace with,31
NA,modern development. The amendment of,31
NA,the amendment refers to stripper-harves-,31
NA,ters. There can be no doubt that great im-,31
NA,provements will be made in those machines,31
NA,as the result of experiments being made,31
NA,by agricultural experts. But what would,31
NA,I be the position i f an improved stripper-har-,31
NA,vester were sought to be introduced? Is it,31
NA,to be said that because the improved ma-,31
NA,chine would interfere with the business of,31
NA,a local manufacturer the fanners should be,31
NA,prevented from obtaining it? Should the,32
NA,farmers be injured in this way merely to,32
NA,strengthen the position of a manufacturer,32
NA,of obsolete machines? The Committee,32
NA,have largely followed the lead of the Min-,32
NA,"istry, failing to recognise that they are",32
NA,ing this action in the interests of the manu-,32
NA,"facturers alone, but I trust that they realize",32
NA,the true position. Had the Government,32
NA,agreed to the amendment enabling the Jus-,32
NA,"tice to fix prices, we might have allowed",32
NA,the present proposa.1 to pass; but they seem,32
NA,to be endeavouring to do all they can to,32
NA,"help the manufacturers, who comprise the",32
NA,smallest section of the community. That,32
NA,is the one object of the B i l l . I shall vote,32
NA,for the amendment moved by the honorable,32
NA,member for Franklin. The proposal sub-,32
NA,mitted by the Minister is absurd. I f the,32
NA,Government are opposed to the amendment,32
NA,"of the honorable member for Franklin, the",32
NA,Ministry should negative it in a straight-,32
NA,"out, honest way, and not seek to defeat it",32
NA,by a side wind. No doubt the Minister of,32
NA,Trade and 'Customs will boast to his consti-,32
NA,tuents that he has assisted the farmer by,32
NA,reducing the price of stripper-harvesters;,32
NA,but he knows that his one object has been,32
NA,to enable local manufacturers of those,32
NA,machines to obtain a higher price for them.,32
NA,I f he speaks the truth he will admit that,32
NA,his object is to prevent the competition,32
NA,which keeps down prices. I f he were,32
NA,honestly pursuing the object that 'he claims,32
NA,"to have before him, he would simply",32
NA,refuse to give an advantage to Mr.,32
NA,MCKay when he was in a combine,32
NA,to keep up prices against the farmers.,32
NA,They certainly deserve no consideration.,32
NA,I f I were satisfied that the business of Mr.,32
NA,MCKay was being ruined by importations of,32
NA,"harvesting machinery, I should not be pre-",32
NA,"pared to give him any assistance, because",32
NA,he was in combination with others to keep,32
NA,up the price of agricultural machinery,32
NA,against the farmer. Throughout the con-,32
NA,sideration of this Bill Ministers apparently,32
NA,have assumed that there is only one class in,32
NA,the community in whose interests legislation,32
NA,should be passed. Amendments in the direc-,32
NA,tion of helping other classes have come only,32
NA,"from the Opposition, who have endeavoured",32
NA,to secure that some protection shall be,32
NA,afforded under this measure to the worker,32
NA,and to the consumer. I shall support the,32
NA,amendment.,32
Mr CAMERON ,Wilmot) [2.52] -- I,32
NA,need hardly say that I strongly support the,32
NA,amendment proposed by the honorable,32
NA,I,32
NA,member for Franklin. The Minister of,32
NA,Trade and Customs proposes to add to it,32
NA,"the words "" without unfairly injuring any",32
NA,"other section of the community."" I t ap-",32
NA,pears to me that those words would cover,32
NA,"tak- too much ground. I f they are accepted,",32
NA,and one or two persons claim to be un-,32
NA,"fairly injured, they will prevent the pri-",32
NA,mary producer from being considered. I t,32
NA,is almost universally accepted that in all,32
NA,cases the majority should rule. That is,32
NA,"the principle followed in this House, and",32
NA,I think it should be applied in this case.,32
NA,I f it is shown that only a very limited,32
NA,number of persons are likely to be injured,32
NA,"by the importation of the articles specified,",32
NA,and that their importation will benefit the,32
NA,"great majority of the primary producers, it",32
NA,is the majority who should be considered.,32
NA,I am aware that the Minister has a majority,32
NA,"of supporters behind him, but I still ask",32
NA,the honorable gentleman to so alter the,32
NA,amendment which he has proposed as to,32
NA,enable the interests of the majority of the,32
NA,persons concerned to be considered. Know-,32
NA,ing how fond the honorable gentleman is of,32
NA,"fair play, and that he is a strong believer",32
NA,"in majority rule, I ask him not to impose",32
NA,conditions which may have disastrous,32
NA,effects upon the primary producers as a,32
NA,"whole, and merely for the benefit of a few",32
NA,small men engaged in a particular trade.,32
Mr KELLY , T h e honorable member,32
NA,does not call MCKay a small man ?,32
Mr CAMERON , I do not know,32
NA,whether he is a 'small or a big,32
NA,"man, but I consider that he is a",32
NA,most unfair man. I am sorry to see,32
NA,"that Ministers, who should consult the",32
NA,"interests of the people as a whole,",32
NA,are prepared to consider the interests,32
NA,of individuals as against those of the,32
NA,great majority. We know that the,32
NA,interests of the towns are freouently dia-,32
NA,metrically opposed to those of the coun-,32
NA,"try, but i f the country suffers the towns",32
NA,must feel the effect. I n all the circum-,32
NA,"stances, it appears to me that the Min-",32
NA,ister should take a broadminded view of,32
NA,this matter. As the honorable ggntleman,32
NA,"is strong, he should be merciful. As this",32
NA,is about the last occasion in connexion with,32
NA,this Bill on which members of the Op-,32
NA,position can appeal to honorable members,32
NA,opposite to dojustice to the primary pro-,32
NA,"ducers, T hope thev will respond unani-",32
NA,"mously to the appeal, and will accept the",32
NA,amendment of the honorable member for,32
NA,Franklin.,32
Mr KELLY ,Wentworth) [2.55!-Lik e,33
NA,"the honorable member who preceded me,",33
NA,I also rise to make an appeal to the,33
NA,humanitarian instincts of the Minister i n,33
NA,charge of this B i l l. I hope the appeal,33
NA,"will be successful, as otherwise I am afraid",33
NA,that the Committee will be called upon,33
NA,"to divide on the question as to which, of",33
NA,the great industries of the Commonwealth,33
NA,is of more importance-th e primary indus-,33
NA,"tries or the secondary industries, f o r whose",33
NA,benefit this Bill has been introduced.,33
NA,"Without intending to be offensive, I think",33
NA,that the Minister may be congratulated,33
NA,upon the slimness of his amendment.,33
NA,NA,33
NA,has outslimmed honorable members oppo-,33
NA,site.,33
Mr KELLY , T h e Minister's amend-,33
NA,"ment is a very slim one, but I do not think",33
NA,it will go down with the people when they,33
NA,understand i t properly. Under the amend-,33
NA,ment moved by the honorable member for,33
NA,"Franklin, the Justice, in certain cases,",33
NA,would be required to take into considera-,33
NA,tion the question whether goods being im-,33
NA,ported will benefit the primary producer.,33
NA,"I f the Justice takes that into consideration,",33
NA,ipso facto he must also take into considera-,33
NA,tion the question whether their importation,33
NA,will not benefit every industry in Australia.,33
NA,"Every industry we have, and every phase",33
NA,"of trade in the Commonwealth, depends to",33
NA,some extent on the success o f the primary,33
NA,"industries. I f , through lack of the proper",33
NA,"implements and tools of trade, the primary",33
NA,"industries languish, every industry in the",33
NA,Commonwealth must suffer. What is asked,33
NA,by the amendment of the honorable mem-,33
NA,"ber for Franklin is, not that the primary",33
NA,producers should be given some unfair ad-,33
NA,"vantage, but merely that they shall be en-",33
NA,abled without interference to continue their,33
NA,"avocations, which are of so much benefit",33
NA,to the whole Commonwealth.,33
Mr ISAACS ,Th e honorable member is,33
NA,referring to the Minister's amendment.,33
Mr KELLY , N o ; the Minister's,33
NA,amendment is quite different. I t is very,33
NA,"specious, but i t will not stand investigation.",33
NA,The Minister's proposed addition of the,33
NA,"words "" without unfairly injuring any-",33
NA,"other section of the community,"" would",33
NA,enable any manufacturer to hold up the,33
NA,whole of the primary producing industries,33
NA,of the Commonwealth. One manufacturer,33
NA,"has only to prove that "" unfair competition.""",33
NA,"not in the usual acceptation of the term,",33
NA,but according to this Bill-an d unfair com-,33
NA,petition according to this Bill is successful,33
NA,"competition-i s talcing place, and i f i t is",33
NA,shown that goods are being imported suc-,33
NA,"cessfully against the local manufacturer,",33
NA,the whole of the producing industries of,33
NA,Australia may be held up. We have had,33
NA,enough of these catch cries. The Minister,33
NA,will deeply regret i t i f he insists on the,33
NA,insertion of the word because the farmers,33
NA,t,33
NA,of his own electorate will see the hol-,33
NA,"lowness of the proposal, which is drafted",33
NA,to hoodwink them. The farmers of the,33
NA,Hume are quite as intelligent as the,33
NA,farmers in other parts of the Common-,33
NA,"wealth, although they have in the past",33
NA,returned the Minister of Trade and Cus-,33
NA,toms as their representative.,33
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , A n d they always,33
NA,will return me.,33
Mr KELLY , I am sure the farmers of,33
NA,the Hume will not rStain their confidence in,33
NA,the Minister i f he insists on these provi-,33
NA,sions. I do not seem to have been able to.,33
NA,"induce the Minister to meet our views, or to",33
NA,act in the interests of his constituents; and,33
NA,"we must have a division, so as to force on",33
NA,honorable members the duty of deciding,33
NA,"whether we ought, on the one hand, to con-",33
NA,"sider the great primary industries, or, 011",33
NA,"the other hand, the private fortunes of one",33
NA,or two manufacturers.,33
Mr ROBINSON ,"Wannon), [3.2] -",33
NA,"There must be a division on this question,",33
NA,"in order to test the sincerity of Ministers,",33
NA,"-and of a section o f the Committee, i n their",33
NA,statement that nothing in the measure is,33
NA,likelv to injure the primary producers. The,33
NA,description o f the implements given in the,33
NA,"clause is taken from the New Zealand Act,",33
NA,"the only addition being "" stripper harvesters",33
NA,and any other implement usually used in,33
NA,"agriculture."" On the second reading we",33
NA,"discussed the New Zealand Act, and i t was",33
NA,pointed out by the honorable member for,33
NA,"Echuca, and others, that Mr Seddon pro-",33
NA,"vided that, i f the manufacturers of such",33
NA,implements were suffering from unfair com-,33
NA,"petition, they should receive a bonus. The",33
NA,honorable member f o r Franklin desires to,33
NA,provide that the Justice shall inquire,33
NA,"whether the goods used by farmers, or",33
NA,"likelv to be used bv them, are imported",33
NA,with the effect of benefiting the primary,33
NA,producers. The effect of the amendment,33
NA,proposed by the Minister is that any manu-,33
NA,facturer who produces obsolete implements,33
NA,which are superseded by an imported,33
NA,"article, would be able to block the importa-",33
NA,tion on the ground that i t injured himself,33
NA,and those whom he employed. I t would,33
NA,be far more courageous and sincere i f Min-,34
NA,"sters, instead of endeavourng to wriggle out",34
NA,"of their difficulty by such an amendment,",34
NA,were to vote directly against the clause.,34
NA,"However, I do not think that the amend-",34
NA,ment of the Ministry will have the effect of,34
NA,blinding the country people. The amend-,34
NA,ment proposed by the honorable member,34
NA,for Franklin affords an opportunity to show,34
NA,that the Ministry are not prepared to con-,34
NA,sider the interests of the primary producers,34
NA,"when we put them"" to a crucial test.",34
Mr MAHON , I thought the honorable,34
NA,member was against class legislation.,34
Mr ROBINSON ,An d so I am; and,34
NA,I sav that two-thirds of the measure is,34
NA,class legislation. The honorable member,34
NA,for Coolgardie must admit this part of the,34
NA,Bill has been introduced for the benefit of,34
NA,"one class-fo r the benefit, indeed, of one",34
NA,member of that class. This part of the,34
NA,measure is proposed in the interests of 'the,34
NA,manufacturers of agricultural implements;,34
NA,and we should never have heard o f provi-,34
NA,"siorts of the kind, but for the skilful out-",34
NA,cry raised throughout the country by one,34
NA,-gentleman engaged in the industry. This,34
NA,amendment of the honorable member for,34
NA,Franklin is for the purpose of protect-,34
NA,ing,34
Mr MAHON , A class.,34
Mr ROBINSON ,Th e amendment is,34
NA,for the purpose of protecting one section of,34
NA,the community against class legislation for,34
NA,Which the honorable member for Coolgardie,34
NA,has voted in every division. A good clean-,34
NA,cut issue is now presented to us.,34
Mr MAHON ,Wh y is the miner not in-,34
NA,cluded ?,34
Mr ROBINSON , I f the honorable,34
NA,member chooses to propose that miners shall,34
NA,"be included I shall Vote with him ; indeed,",34
NA,I should have the greatest pleasure in sub-,34
NA,mitting such an amendment on his behalf.,34
Mr ISAACS ,W e protect the miner in,34
NA,our further amendment.,34
Mr ROBINSON ,"Really , I think we",34
NA,"ought to subscribe, and present the At-",34
NA,torney-General with a leather medal. Of,34
NA,all the honorable and learned gentleman's,34
NA,"protestations of patriotism, and regard for",34
NA,"other people's interest, his last interjection",34
NA,reaches the culminating point. The A t -,34
NA,torney-General has protested his patriot-,34
NA,ism on every platform; and I have no,34
NA,doubt that when he goes down to his,34
NA,"grave, his simple epitaph will be "" A",34
NA,"Patriot.'.' Just as a lady, now dead,",34
NA,is said to have had engraved on her,34
NA,"heart one word, so shall we find on the",34
NA,"heart of the Attorney-General, "" Patriot-",34
NA,"ism."" The question before us is whether",34
NA,the primary producers are to have their in-,34
NA,terests considered in these determinations.,34
NA,No doubt their interests ought to be con-,34
NA,"sidered; 'but, in contrast to the amend-",34
NA,ment of the honorable member for Frank-,34
NA,"lin, the amendment of the Ministry seeks",34
NA,to put those interests in a secondary place.,34
NA,I am very glad to say that a large por-,34
NA,tion of the manufacturing classes have pro-,34
NA,"tested against the B i l l , but, when dealing",34
NA,"with legislation of the kind, .we ought to",34
NA,pay some consideration to those who pro-,34
NA,vide the means whereby the interest on,34
NA,"our public debt is paid, and the country",34
NA,enabled to carry on business from day to,34
NA,day. The question is whether the pri-,34
NA,"mary producers are to be considered, or",34
NA,whether their interests are to be scattered,34
NA,to the winds. I hope honorable members,34
NA,will accept the amendment of the honor-,34
NA,"able member for Franklin, because, i f they",34
NA,"do not, they will act to the detriment o f",34
NA,the interests of the primary producers.,34
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) [3.8] -Th e,34
NA,clause under discussion is substantially,34
NA,taken from the New Zealand Act. Out,34
NA,"of Â£120,000,000 worth of products o f",34
NA,"Australia, excluding New Zealand,",34
NA,"Â£90.000,000 worth is the result of the",34
NA,"work of the primary producers, and over",34
NA,"650,000 persons are engaged in these",34
NA,great primary industries. I f we take as,34
NA,an example New South Wales before any,34
NA,"duties were imposed, we find that out of",34
NA,"Â£30,000,000 worth of secondary products,",34
NA,"Â£28,000.000 worth were created without",34
NA,"the aid of anv Tariff. Thus, in the pri-",34
NA,"mary industries Â£90.000,000 worth, of",34
NA,"produce, and in the -secondary industries",34
NA,"Â£28,000,000 have been created with-",34
NA,out any artificial aid. A t the present,34
NA,"time we are paying Â£10,000,000 in order",34
NA,to get less than Â£2.000.000 worth,34
NA,of manufactures in another direction;,34
NA,"in other words, we are paying Â£ 5",34
NA,"for every pound we get back, apart",34
NA,from the extra value ' people have to,34
NA,pay in th'e retail trade. I may fur-,34
NA,"ther show the position by stating, shortly,",34
NA,"that out of Â£120,000.000 worth of",34
NA,"produce. , Â£ r 18,000,000 worth is created",34
NA,without any extraneous help whatever:,34
NA,"and, that being so, it is onlv right and",34
NA,proper that we should consider the in-,34
NA,terests of the great primary producers.,34
NA,The nroposal of the Government means,34
NA,that i f a manufacturer of stripper harves-,34
NA,ters likes to come forward and say that he,34
NA,"is being injured, i t will be within the power",35
NA,of the Minister to penalise the farmers and,35
NA,producers in order to bolster up the indus-,35
NA,try of that gentleman. The. Government,35
NA,ihas already opposed an amendment which,35
NA,provided that fair and reasonable wages,35
NA,"should be paid, and that fair prices",35
NA,should be fixed at which the articles,35
NA,affected should be sold; showing that,35
NA,"they intend to make' this Bill,",35
NA,"far as possible, operate in favour of one",35
NA,or two individuals. The amendment upon,35
NA,the amendment would prevent the primary,35
NA,producers from getting the benefit of any,35
NA,improvements in machinery which might,35
NA,"be introduced. I am glad that the B i l l,",35
NA,"even at this late stage, has been somewhat",35
NA,"improved, but it still requires many radical",35
NA,modifications.,35
Mr LONSDALE ,New England) [3.15]-,35
NA,- I rise to reply to an interjection made,35
NA,by the honorable member for Coolgardie.,35
The CHAIRMAN ,Interjection s are,35
NA,"disorderly, and tbe honorable member has",35
NA,no right to reply to them.,35
Mr LONSDALE , I t has been said,35
NA,that this amendment does not exempt the,35
NA,miner. I am prepared to test the honesty,35
NA,of the honorable member who made that,35
NA,interjection by moving an amendment which,35
NA,will exempt the miner. The honorable,35
NA,member for Coolgardie said that the,35
NA,amendment is for the benefit of one,35
NA,special class. The Bill throughout is in-,35
NA,tended to benefit the smallest class in the,35
NA,community. Yet the honorable member,35
NA,who made that remark does not dare to,35
NA,raise his voice against it. He sits calmly,35
NA,behind the Ministry voting for class legis-,35
NA,lation of the worst description.,35
NA,amendment widens the scope of the Bill . I,35
NA,am prepared to widen it as much as possible.,35
NA,I do not come here to vote for legislation,35
NA,in the interests of two or three manufac-,35
NA,turers. I am prepared to place the miners,35
NA,on the same footing as that upon which this,35
NA,amendment seeks to place the agricultur-,35
NA,"ists. I like men to be consistent, and when",35
NA,some honorable members condemn class,35
NA,legislation and at the same time sit behind,35
NA,a Ministry which is guilty of the grossest,35
NA,"legislation of that description, and never",35
NA,"open their mouths in protest against it, I",35
NA,stigmatise their interjections as simply,35
NA,hypocritical.,35
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) [3.17] - I,35
NA,wish to give another reason why the amend-,35
NA,ment should be adopted. When the Tariff,35
NA,"was being dealt with, the manufacturers",35
NA,obtained large exemptions for their tools of,35
NA,trade. We are simply asking that the,35
NA,primary producers should be treated in the,35
NA,same manner. I am prepared also to ac-,35
NA,cept the suggestion of the honorable mem-,35
NA,"ber for Coolgardie, and to exempt the",35
NA,miners. I should be only too happy to,35
NA,support an amendment in that direction.,35
NA,"Question-Tha t the words "" without un-",35

Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,North,36
NA,Sydney) [3.27]--Som e time ago I referred,36
NA,to the desirability of providing in the clause,36
NA,for an appeal from the decision of the,36
NA,Justice. Since that time I have been,36
NA,given reasons for not giving an appeal,36
NA,"which might cover a matter of fact, but I",36
NA,can see no Objection-an d I think that the,36
NA,Attorney-General agrees with that view-,36
NA,to giving an appeal on a matter of law.,36
NA,"Of his own motion, the Justice can state",36
NA,a case for the opinion of the Full Court,36
NA,"on a question of law, and I desire to give",36
NA,"either party the right to obtain, by request,",36
NA,such an appeal. I understand from the,36
NA,Attorney-General that it will have to be in-,36
NA,serted after sub-clause 2. I should like,36
NA,to know if he agrees to the right of appeal,36
NA,being granted.,36
Mr ISAACS ,Indi-Atorney-General ),36
NA,"[3.28] -W e have no objection to that, but",36
NA,it can only be done on a recommittal of,36
NA,the clause. We shall recommit it for that,36

NA,"Clause, as amended, agreed to.",36
NA,Clause 18-,36

NA,"the powers of the Customs Act 1901, prohibit",36
NA,the importation of the imported goods either,36

NA,"in the circumstances.""",36
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,North Syd-,36
NA,ney) [3.32] - I think that the amendment,36
NA,should be amended by inserting after the,36
NA,"word "" Act,"" line 16, the words "" except",36
NA,"as to forfeiture."" As I read the provision,",36
NA,the goods to which it refers are to be pro-,36
NA,hibited imports according to section 52 of,36
NA,"the Customs Act, and section 229 of that",36
NA,Act declares that all prohibited imports,36
NA,shall be forfeited to His Majesty.,36
Mr ISAACS ,I t might be that the im-,36
NA,"portation of certain goods was prohibited,",36
NA,but that they were being imported in defi-,36
NA,ance of the prohibition.,36
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Th e im-,36
NA,portation could be stopped. The goods,36
NA,whose importation is prohibited by the,36
NA,Customs Act are works infringing copy-,36
NA,"right, false money, counterfeit coin, blas-",36
NA,"phemous, indecent, and obscene publica-",36
NA,"tions, prison-made goods, exhausted tea,",36
NA,"oleomargarine and butterine, and goods",36
NA,whose importation has been prohibited by,36
NA,proclamation as undesirable.,36
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ,Th e Minister is not,36
NA,compelled by the Customs Act to forfeit.,36
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Th e Act,36
NA,"says "" the following goods shall be for-",36
NA,"LYNE) feited to His Majesty."" I see no reason",36
NA,for forfeiture under the Bill. Bonds have,36
NA,"to be given, and penalties can be imposed.",36
NA,Some of the competition which it is desired,36
NA,"to prevent is, in my opinion, fair compe-",36
NA,tition.,36
Mr ISAACS ,Indi-Attorney-General ),36
NA,[3-34]--Th e goods which are brought into,36
NA,Australia may be the subject of a proceed-,36
NA,"ing before the Justice, and. if a bond is",36
NA,"(riven, will be permitted to go into circula-",36
NA,tion. But i f the Justice determines that,36
NA,"there is unfair competition, future impor-",36
NA,"the im- tations may be prohibited, and if, in de-",36
NA,"fiance of that prohibition, the importation",36
NA,"imcontinues, there will be no distinction be-",36
NA,tween the goods prohibited under this mea-,36
NA,sure and those prohibited under the Cus-,36
NA,toms Act.,36
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,North Syd-,36
NA,ney) [3.35] -Thi s part of the Bill pro-,36
NA,hibits only certain action in connexion with,36
NA,"imported goods, yet the Minister is asking",37
NA,to have the power to prohibit the importa-,37
NA,tion of goods.,37
Mr GLYNN ,Th e mischievous part of,37
NA,the provision is that it may allow the pro-,37
NA,hibition of the importation of a whole class,37
NA,"of goods, no matter what alteration of con-",37
NA,ditions takes place.,37
Mr HIGGINS ,I f the unfair competi-,37
NA,"tion ceases, the prohibition may be at once",37
NA,rescinded.,37
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Bu t why,37
NA,"should goods which, in themselves, are",37
NA,harmless be forfeited i f imported? It is,37
NA,"not the nature of the goods which offends,",37
NA,but the fact o'f their sale under conditions,37
NA,which the Judge determines amount to un-,37
NA,fair competition.,37
Mr ISAACS ,Prohibitio n of importa-,37
NA,tion may be the only way to stop the com-,37
NA,mission of the offence.,37
Mr DUGALD THOMSON , Why,37
NA,should goods be forfeited because of a,37
NA,mere opinion ?,37
Mr ISAACS ,The y .can be forfeited,37
NA,only upon the determination of the Justice.,37
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Tha t,37
NA,will be merely a legal opinion. Persons,37
NA,will not send goods here i f the Justice de-,37
NA,cides that their importation under certain,37
NA,conditions amounts to unfair competition.,37
Mr ISAACS ,Th e Minister of Trade,37
NA,and Customs pointed out some time ago,37
NA,"that he has, under the Customs Act, the",37
NA,"power to prohibit importation, but that he",37
NA,would not use it in this connexion.,37
Sir WILLIAM LYNE , I have refused to,37
NA,use it until I get a specific authority under,37
NA,this measure.,37
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,Anothe r,37
NA,Minister might use the power.,37
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,I t is given to be,37
NA,used.,37
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,N o for-,37
NA,"feiture takes place in Canada, the goods",37
NA,there being admitted subject to the pay-,37
NA,ment of an increase in duty. I see no,37
NA,"reason for ,'forfeiture, because the Justice",37
NA,can impose what conditions he likes as to,37
NA,entry. Surely that is sufficient.,37
Mr ISAACS ,Thi s is a reserve power,37
NA,which will be used only in case of wilful,37
NA,"defiance, when there is no other way to",37
NA,enforce the Justice's order.,37
Mr DUGALD THOMSON , I see no,37
NA,necessity for it. The Justice will deter-,37
NA,mine the conditions under which goods,37
NA,"may be imported, and the prohibition is",37
NA,not because of anything deleterious in the,37
NA,nature of the goods themselves. The Judge,37
NA,"could fix conditions, however severe, under",37
NA,which the goods should ibe imported.,37
Mr ISAACS ,Suppos e that those condi-,37
NA,tions were not complied with ?,37
Mr DUGALD THOMSON ,The n the,37
NA,goods would be shut out altogether. I t is,37
NA,not right that the goods should be for-,37
NA,feited. There might be no objection to the,37
NA,goods themselves. In the cases in which,37
NA,the powers of forfeiture are exercised under,37
NA,"the Customs Act, the goods are supposed",37
NA,to be deleterious or harmful. The articles,37
NA,with which we are now proposing to deal,37
NA,"might ibe perfectly sound and desirable,",37
NA,"and there would be np reason to object, 'to",37
NA,"their introduction under certain conditions,",37
NA,which the Judge could make as drastic as,37
NA,he pleased.,37
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne),37
NA,[3.41] - I should like to know i f the At-,37
NA,torney-General thinks that under the clause,37
NA,as it stands a prohibition applying to the,37
NA,goods introduced by one importer would,37
NA,extend to all similar goods of the same,37
NA,"manufacturer, irrespective of the conditions",37
NA,under which they were imported and sold.,37
NA,It seems to me that under paragraph a the,37
NA,determination of the Justice would have,37
NA,the effect o'f a proclamation under the,37
NA,"Customs Act 1901, and would apply to all",37
NA,"goods of a certain class. I find, on looking",37
NA,"at the interpretation clause, that imported",37
NA,"goods include all goods of certain classes,",37
NA,or all parts or ingredients thereof.,37
Mr ISAACS ,Indi-Attorney-General ),37
NA,[3-43]--Absolut e power is given to the,37
NA,Justice to make an order that he thinks will,37
NA,meet the case. I f only one person is con-,37
NA,"cerned in the offence, he will make an order",37
NA,accordingly. Power is given to the Justice,37
NA,"to look into the circumstances, and to make",37
NA,his order fit them.,37
Mr HIGGINS ,Doe s the Attorney-Gene-,37
NA,ral think that the Justice will have power,37
NA,to differentiate between different importers,37
NA,of the same class of goods ?,37
Mr ISAACS ,"Yes , I think so. I do",37
NA,not know of any other words that would,37
NA,meet the case. We can only give the Jus-,37
NA,"tice unrestricted power, and trust him to",37
NA,make no more stringent order than is neces-,37
NA,sary. 1,37
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne),37
NA,[3.44] - I think it is necessary to clearly,37
NA,indicate that the Justice is empowered to,37
NA,differentiate between one importer and an-,37
NA,"other, otherwise the provision will fail to",37
NA,accomplish its object. I f the Justice finds,37
NA,tliat by making a determination it will,37
NA,apply to all the goods manufactured by,38
NA,"one person, he may hesitate to practically",38
NA,exclude the whole of such articles from our,38
NA,market. There may be two importers of,38
NA,"goods made by the same manufacturer, and",38
NA,one only may be unfairly competing.,38
NA,feel sure that the Attorney-General does,38
NA,not desire to prevent the Justice from re-,38
NA,stricting the effect of his proclamation by,38
NA,-determining that it shall apply only to,38
NA,"goods consigned to certain persons, or im-",38
NA,ported under certain conditions.,38
Mr GLYNN ,Angas) [3.46] --Through -,38
NA,out the B i l l the provisions for prohibition,38
NA,"are directed against classes of poods, and",38
NA,this fact has to a large extent inspired the,38
NA,-opposition of honorable members on this,38
NA,side of the Chamber. Although an offence,38
NA,may be committed by only one importer of,38
NA,".a certain class of goods, all similar articles",38
NA,will be placed under a ban. The power,38
NA,"to remove the ban is given, not to Parlia-",38
NA,"ment, or to the Justice, but to the Execu-",38
NA,tive only. Six months after a proclamation,38
NA,had been made it might be found that the,38
NA,-circumstances ofi the trade had undergone a,38
NA,"complete change, and yet the prohibition",38
NA,wouldl continue in force. The remarks,38
NA,o f the honorable and learned member for,38
NA,Northern Melbourne indicate clearly the,38
NA,harsh character of the provisions of the,38
NA,"measure, and I am sorry that he did not",38
NA,at an earlier stage grant us his assistance,38
NA,in toning down their effect. I am glad,38
NA,that he has suggested that the Judge,38
NA,should have power to limit the prohibition,38
NA,to the gcods introduced by the offending,38
NA,"importer. Under the Bill, as it stands, i f",38
NA,"one importer of machines, such as har-",38
NA,"vesters, were competing unfairly, twenty",38
NA,other importers of similar goods operating,38
NA,"under perfectly fair conditions, might be",38
NA,prevented from continuing to carry on their,38
NA,business.,38
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne),38
NA,[3.48] - I understand that the Attorney-,38
NA,General will consent to an amendment ir.,38
NA,"the direction I have indicated, and I there-",38
NA,fore move-,38
NA,That the amendment be amended by the in-,38
NA,"sertion after the word "" restrictions,"" line 8;",38
NA,"of the words "" or limitations of any kind what-",38
NA,"soever.""",38
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) [3.49] - I do,38
NA,not think that the amendment would go,38
NA,"-quite far enough. I n paragraph d, of sub-",38
NA,"clause 2 of clause 14, it is provided that",38
NA,competition shall be deemed unfair-,38
NA,I f the imported goods have been purchased,38
NA,"abroad, by or for the importer from the manu-",38
NA,facturer or some person acting for or in com-,38
NA,"bination with him or accounting to him, at prices",38
NA,"greatly below their ordinary cost of , production",38
NA,where produced or market price where pur-,38
NA,chased.,38
NA,I t is clear that that might happen in only,38
NA,I one or two isolated cases. A man might,38
NA,"import certain goods, and a Justice of the",38
NA,H i gh Court might make an order which,38
NA,would affect the whole of that class of,38
NA,"goods. I n other words, because one man",38
NA,chose to act unfairly by importing certain,38
NA,"commodities, a prohibition might be im-",38
NA,posed upon the whole of that particular,38
NA,class of goods. Surely that cannot be the,38
NA,intention of Ministers.,38
Mr HIGGINS , But clause 18 is the,38
NA,"operative clause, and no harm can be done",38
NA,i f we define unfair competition.,38
Mr CONROY ,"A s the clause stands,",38
NA,I hold that it is not sufficient. Even i f,38
NA,the honorable and learned member for,38
NA,"Northern Melbourne be right, I still say",38
NA,that it should not be within the power of,38
NA,any single Justice to make an order from,38
NA,which there can be no appeal whatever.,38
NA,Perhaps the Attorney-General will now see,38
NA,the force of allowing an appeal from the,38
NA,"decision of a Justice upon a matter of fact,",38
NA,as well as upon a question of law. I f such,38
NA,extraordinary powers are to be vested in a,38
NA,"single Justice, it is highly desirable that we",38
NA,should permit of an appeal being made to,38
NA,the F u l l Court. Upon .questions of law,38
NA,"there can be an, appeal in any case.",38
Mr ISAACS ,No .,38
Mr CONROY ,Unde r the Constitution,38
NA,Act an appeal is allowed upon questions of,38
NA,law. Having regard to the decision of the,38
NA,"Privy Council the other day, in the case",38
NA,"of an appeal from the High Court, I say",38
NA,that we cannot prohibit appeals upon,38
NA,points of law under certain circumstances.,38
NA,""" - Clearly, we ought to vest in the High Court",38
NA,the power to decide whether or not one of,38
NA,its Justices has acted properly. I do not,38
NA,"think that the addition of the words "" all",38
NA,"limitations of any kind whatsoever "" is suffi-",38
NA,"cient, and the Attorney-General ought to",38
NA,recognise that. I t would be very much,38
NA,better to make an alteration in the direction,38
NA,I have suggested. I t ought not to be,38
NA,within the power of a single Justice to pro-,38
NA,hibit the importation of any particular,38
NA,class of goods.,38
Mr ISAACS ,Tha t power is not con-,38
NA,tained in this clause.,38
Mr CONROY ,Wil l the Attorney-Gen-,38
NA,eral agree to permit of an appeal being,38
NA,made to the High Court in cases where,38
NA,the determination of a single Justice abso-,39
NA,lutely prohibits the importation of a certain,39
NA,class of 'goods?,39
Mr ISAACS ,"Personally , I would ob-",39
NA,"ject, but the matter is one for the Minister",39
NA,to decide.,39
Sir WILLIAM LYNE ," I t is a legal point,",39
NA,and I am content to leave it to the Attor-,39
NA,ney-General.,39
Mr ISAACS ,Appeal s would prove very,39
NA,"expensive, and it would be against the in-",39
NA,terests of business men to have the matter,39
NA,hung up so long.,39
Mr CONROY ,Th e penalty provided,39
NA,is a very severe one. Not merely are the,39
NA,goods which form the subject of the pro-,39
NA,"ceedings under the Act to be forfeited, but",39
NA,all other consignments which may have,39
NA,been ordered by a number of individuals,39
NA,prior to the initiation of those proceedings.,39
NA,Under the Customs Act of 1901 there is no,39
NA,power to revoke that prohibition.,39
Mr ISAACS ,Th e power is contained in,39
NA,a subsequent section.,39
Mr CONROY ,Th e Executive may at,39
NA,a subsequent period revoke i t .,39
Mr ISAACS ,--The y may do so immedi-,39
NA,ately i f they choose.,39
Mr CONROY , But the damage will,39
NA,have been done in the meantime. The for-,39
NA,feiture clauses of the Customs Act operate,39
NA,"immediately, and there is no power vested",39
NA,in the Minister to restore the goods to,39
NA,their original owner. The forfeiture is,39
NA,"absolute, ancl cannot be revoked.",39
NA,Air. ISAACS -W e have already stated,39
NA,that we cannot agree to the honorable and,39
NA,learned member's suggestion.,39
Mr CONROY ,Surel v the matter is,39
NA,too important to be lightlv brushed aside,39
NA,in that way. We have established a High,39
NA,Court for the purpose of determining all,39
NA,"appeals, and yet it is now proposed 1o",39
NA,take awav from it the right to hear them.,39
NA,"To mv mind, that is casting a stigma",39
NA,upon the tribunal in question. I f we pre-,39
NA,vent the High Court from hearing these,39
NA,appeals it is only necessary to go a step,39
NA,"further, and to deprive it of some of its",39
NA,"original jurisdiction, to enable three Jus-",39

Mr FRAZER ,Doe s the honorable and,39

Mr CONROY ,"I n certain cases, I",39
NA,do absolutely. I would have cases de-,39
NA,cided in the most inexpensive wav pos-,39
NA,sible. I f the Attorney-General maintains,39
NA,that a single Justice can determine these,39
NA,"matters, why should we appoint more Jus-",39
NA,tices? I f the powers of appeal to the,39
NA,"High Court are tp be swept away, I can-",39
NA,not support the appointment of any addi-,39
NA,tional Justices for manv years to come.,39
NA,Under the Bil l it is prooosed to vest ex-,39
NA,"traordinary powers in a single Justice, and",39
NA,to allow no appeal from his decision upon,39
NA,matters of fact.,39
Mr ISAACS ,--Upo n matters of fact,39
NA,only.,39
Mr CONROY ,Unde r the Constitu-,39
NA,tion Act there is an appeal from his de-,39
NA,cision upon matters of law. We are,39
NA,putting it in the power of the Justice to,39
NA,declare that all goods--an d not merely the,39
NA,particular consignment in question-shal l,39
NA,be absolutely prohibited and come under,39
NA,the Customs Act o f 1901. On referring,39
NA,"to that Act, we find that it conta'ins pro 1",39
NA,visions relating to prohibited goods which',39
NA,involve absolute forfeiture. I n these cir-,39
NA,cumstances there should be an appeal to,39
NA,the High Court before any one Justice,39
NA,could take it upon himself to declare goods,39
NA,absolutely forfeited.,39
Mr MAHON ,Doe s not the honorable,39
NA,"and learned member think that, as a Jus-",39

NA,"affecting the life and liberty of a man,",39
NA,he might be allowed to deal with these,39
NA,matters ?,39
Mr CONROY ,I n criminal cases the,39
NA,"Justice has the assistance of a jury, and",39
NA,there is always an appeal to the F u l l Court,39
NA,on questions of law. Parliament is asked,39
NA,to give away so much of its rights in this,39

NA,a Justice.,39
Mr MAHON , He might be a free-,39

Mr KELLY ,Tha t is so : but I submit,41

NA,That the following new clause be inserted :-,41
NA,""" IID . (1) Any person party to a contract or",41
NA,member of a combination or in any way con-,41
NA,cerned in carrying out the contract or the ob-,41
NA,jects of the combination may-,41
NA,(a) lodge with the Attorney-General a statu-,41
NA,"tory declaration by himself, or in the",41
NA,case of a corporation by some one,41
NA,approved of in that behalf by the,41
NA,"Attorney-General setting forth truly,",41
NA,"f u l l y , and completely the terms and",41
NA,"particulars of the contract, or the",41
NA,"purposes, objects, and terms of agree-",41
NA,ment or constitution of the combina-,41
NA,"tion, as the case may be, and an ad-",41
NA,dress in Australia to which notices,41
NA,may be sent by the Attorney-General;,41
NA,and,41
NA,(*) publish the statutory declaration in the,41
NA,Gazette.,41
NA,(2) The Attorney-General may at any time,41
NA,send notice to the person above-mentioned (here-,41
NA,inafter called the declarant) to the address men-,41
NA,tioned in the statutory declaration that he con-,41
NA,siders the contract or combination likely to re-,41
NA,strain trade or commerce to the detriment of,41
NA,"the public, or to destroy or injure an Australian",41
NA,industry by unfair competition.,41
NA,(3) In any proceeding against the declarant,41
NA,in respect of any offence against section four,41
NA,or section five of this Act alleged to have been,41
NA,committed by him in relation to the contract,41
NA,or combination after the time the statutory de-,41
NA,"claration has been lodged and published, and",41
NA,before any notice as aforesaid has been sent to,41
NA,him by the Attorney-General it shall be deemed,41
NA,(but as regards the declarant only and not as,41
NA,regards any other person) that the declarant,41
NA,had no intent to contravene the provisions of,41
NA,"the section, i f he proves that the statutory",41
NA,"declaration contains a true, f u l l , and complete",41
NA,statement of the terms and particulars of the,41
NA,"contract, or the purposes, objects, and terms",41
NA,"of agreement or constitution of the combination,",42
NA,"as the case may be, at the date of the statutory",42
NA,declaration and at the date of the alleged,42
NA,"offence.""",42
NA,I understand that the proposed new clause,42
NA,has the approval of the Government. In,42
NA,my speech on the second reading I ex-,42
NA,"pressed the wish that an honest man, who",42
NA,desired to make certain that he was not [4..28,42
NA,"breaking the law, should be able to submit",42
NA,"the question to some official, whose certifiof",42
NA,cate should exonerate him so long,42
NA,lasted. Nine out of every ten of these,42
NA,"agreements are perfectly valid, honest,",42
NA,"impugnable, and there are cases where",42
NA,man would not object to show the terms,42
NA,"a combination to an official; and,",42
NA,"fore, I suggest in the new clause that a",42
NA,man may submit an agreement to the At-,42
NA,"torney-General, who may give a certificate",42
NA,that it does not operate to the harm of,42
NA,"the public or involve unfair competition, agent, makesAny",42
NA,"and that, so long as the certificate is not",42
NA,"withdrawn, the arrangement or contract is",42
NA,not to be deemed as contravening,42
NA,"However, Ministers, especially the Attor-",42
NA,"ney-General, who has kindly looked into imprisonment,",42
NA,"my proposal during the last few days, see tion, Five hundred pounds. .",42
NA,some need for a limitation. Although I,42
NA,confess I should like the clause to pass as to-,42
NA,"I at first proposed, I recognise that what",42
NA,the Government agree to will meet my obin,42
NA,"ject three-fourths of the way,",42
NA,"to save the time of honorable members, I",42
NA,shall submit the new clause in the form,42
NA,which has been approved. The effect of,42
NA,the new .clause is substantially that any,42
NA,person may submit an agreement or arpetition which isUnfair,42
NA,rangement for a combination to the Attorand,42
NA,"ney-General, accompanied bv a sworn debe",42
NA,claration as to its truth. The Attorneyproved-,42
NA,General may then send a reply that he,42
NA,regards the arrangement as detrimental to,42
NA,"the public, or as unfair competition, and",42
NA,"in such case the combination is, of course,",42
NA,illegal. But until the Attorney-General,42
NA,does say that he regards the arrangement 7 and,42
NA,as unfair it is deemed to be fair.,42
Mr ISAACS ,"No ; that is as to the inganization i n . """,42
NA,tent.,42
Mr HIGGINS ,Th e combination is,42
NA,"deemed to be fair, so far as regards any",42
NA,intent on the part of the person who makes in,42
NA,the declaration. I admit that the clause,42
NA,does not .go to the full extent that I,42
NA,but it will at least prevent any man from,42
NA,"being subject to criminal prosecuiion, and",42
NA,"liable to be thrown into gaol, in relation",42
NA,to a matter as to which he had no intent,42
NA,to do anything against the law.,42
NA,[ 6]-,42
NA,4 2,42
NA,I have explained sufficiently what I have,42
NA,"in view; and, although the clause is a",42
NA,"little elaborate, it is plainly worked out",42

NA,the sooner this question is dealt with,44

NA,concerned. I t is not for me to dictate the,44
NA,"order of business to the Government, but",44
NA,we all'have a responsibility to our consti-,44
NA,"tuents and to the country in that regard. I ,",44
NA,"for one, consider that the revision of the",44
NA,Tariff is the most pressing matter before,44
NA,the Parliament. I think that it is infi-,44
NA,nitely more pressing than the measure with,44
NA,which we have been dealing. I understand,44
NA,that on a previous occasion it was intir,44

NA,when they had got further reports. To me,44
NA,that appears to be a waste of time. I f it,44
NA,is intended to proceed with the matter at,44
NA,"all during the.present session, surelv the",44
NA,sooner we begin to do so the better! By,44
NA,the time we shall have finished with the,44
NA,"three reports that are before us, probably",44
NA,others will be to hand. The Attorney-,44
NA,"General will, I am sure, support my re-",44
NA,quest. He will remember how he devoted,44
NA,"his time, in season and out of season,",44
NA,"more especially out of season, in",44
NA,abusing the late Government for not pro-,44
NA,ceeding with an immediate revision of the,44
NA,Tariff-eve n before they had any informa-,44
NA,tion that would enable them to do so satis-,44
NA,factorily. Surely he will see the necessity,44
NA,of not losing any time in dealing with the,44
NA,"matter, now tbat we have reports of the",44
NA,"Tariff Commission to guide us, and enable",44
NA,us to do the work satisfactorily.,44
Mr FISHER ,Wide Bay) [4.44] -A t,44
NA,"every election, nine-tenths of the candidates",44
NA,"and, I believe, nine-tenths of tbe members",44
NA,returned have been distinctly pledged to the,44
NA,.establishment of a scheme of old-age pen-,44
NA,sions. I desire to ask whether the Govern-,44
NA,ment have come to a conclusion on the sub-,44
NA,"ject, and i f so, whether it is proposed at",44
NA,an early date to introduce a. measure of,44
NA,reform about which this Parliament is,44
NA,practically unanimous?,44
Mr DEAKIN ,Ballarat-Prim e Minis-,44
NA,ter) [4.45] - The honorable member for,44
NA,Coolgardie is correctly informed that the,44
NA,delay in tbe consideration of the proposition,44
NA,as to Sir William MCGregor has been due,44
NA,to the necessary arrangements required to,44
NA,be made between the Colonial Office and,44
NA,himself before he can consent to become a,44
NA,candidate for the post. The House,44
NA,"They has already been informed, in reply to the",44
NA,"honorable member for Moreton, it will have",44
NA,the opportunity of discussing the matter,44
NA,before any appointment is made. The con-,44
NA,sideration of a vote for the purpose of wire-,44
NA,less telegraphy will come before the Cabi-,44
NA,"net during the next few weeks, in con-",44
NA,nexion with the preparation of the Esti-,44
NA,mates. The Premier of Queensland is in,44
NA,possession of a copy of the letter which was,44
NA,received by the Government with reference,44
NA,"to Brisbane, and also Melbourne and Syd-",44
NA,"ney, as ports of call in connexion with the",44
NA,oversea mail service. Any statement made,44
NA,by that honorable' gentleman is therefore,44
NA,"certain to be correct, because he has the",44
NA,tenderer's letter in his hand. The-question,44
NA,of altering the date for holding future elec-,44
NA,tions for the Senate to March or April has,44
NA,"not been decided by the Cabinet, but is, I",44
NA,"am in a position to say, favorablv regarded",44
NA,by it. No time will be lost in dealing,44
NA,with the Tariff. I t is recognised that,44
NA,when the proposals are submitted it will,44
NA,be desirable to deal with them in a,44
NA,"group, and, of course, to dispose of them",44
NA,"as rapidly as possible. In the meantime,",44
NA,we have to provide another place with suffi-,44
NA,cient work to keep it continuously occu-,44
NA,pied for the period which we shall need for,44
NA,dealing with the Tariff. Having regard,44
NA,"to both these matters, and the neces-",45
NA,sity for stating tbe financial position of the,45
NA,"Commonwealth, which mav be incidentally",45
NA,"affected by some of these ""proposals, I can",45
NA,promise 'the honorable member th)at the,45
NA,"Tariff will be dealt with, not only as early",45
NA,"as possible, tout as fully as possible. The",45
NA,report of the Royal Commission on Old-,45
NA,Age Pensions is before the Cabinet. The,45
NA,honorable member for Wide Bay correctly,45
NA,states the attitude of the great bulk of hon-,45
NA,"orable members, but he is also aware of",45
NA,"the fact that the whole question turns, not",45
NA,"so much on the adoption of a scheme, as on",45
NA,"the financial arrangements, which, would re-",45
NA,quire to be made regarding it. Those have,45
NA,been under the consideration of my col-,45
NA,"league, the Treasurer, and the Cabinet.",45
NA,I hope that we shall be in a position to,45
NA,make a proposition in that regard before,45
NA,this session closes.,45
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,45
NA,House adjourned at 4.47 p.m.,45

2,The CLERK,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referTo red to the appropriate Ministers: Television: Pornographic Material To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That we strongly oppose the easing of restrictions on the importation, producdon in Australia, sale or distribution of pornographic material whether in films, printed matter or any other format. That any alterations to the Television Programme Standards of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which permits the exploitation of sex or violence is unacceptable to us. Your petiuoners therefore humbly pray that the Government will take no measures to interfere with the existing Television Programme Standards or to permit easier entry into Australia, or production in Australia, of pornographic material. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Dr Edwards, Mr Fairbairn and Mr Luchetti. Petitions received. Universal Health Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the proposed Universal Health Scheme is essential to the well being of all Australians, in so far as it will(i) Provide that all Australians irrespective of their means will have access to a high standard of health care. (ii) Every Australian will be automatically covered for doctors' and hospital bills thus ensuring that citizens will not longer be burdened with addiuonal psychological strains because of inability to meet the high cost of medical treatment. (iii) It is committed, in principle, towards the ideal that an individual's contribution to the cost ofhealth services should be based on his or her capacity to pay-that people who derive the most financial benefit from our society should give the most for its support. (iv) It guarantees freedom of choice so that every Australian will be able to attend the doctor or hospital of his or her own choice. (v) In the long term it will take the politics out of medical care and will thereby medical profession to return to the occupation of their choice-The care of the ill and the prevention of disease. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will hasten to introduce this much needed scheme so that health care services in Australia can begin to function equitably, efficdenUy, and economically. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Martin, Mr Morris and Mr Reynolds. PETITIONS Petitions received. Child Endowment the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Child Endowment received by families has declined relative to average earnings so that today it is about 20 per cent of its value in 1949. The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission Into Poverty recommended a substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poverty. This report pointed out that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment from SO cents to $ 1.50 for the first child; from $ 1.00 to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the founh child; and to $8.00 for subsequent children. Your petitioners humbly request that the Government increase Child Endowment in the September Budget. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Dr Edwards. Petitions received. Aid for Sahelian Region of Africa To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That up to ten million people are said by the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Kurt Waldheim, to face death by starvation in the Sahelian region of Africa and that as a result of this drought, many nomads are being forced to give up their traditional way of life, and That the resources of the Governments of this region are inadequate to cope with either the immediate or long term needs of these people. We your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House urge that the Australian Government grant both immediate emergency aid to a value of at least ten million dollars and continue to assist in the long-term agricultural and social development of this region And that it take a leading part in initiatives to set up a World Food Fund and World Fertilizer Fund at the World Food Conference this November. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, allow dedicated members of the by Dr. J.F. Cairns. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parhament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: Whereas according to the principles embodied in the United Nations chaner the right to self-determination belongs to every nation, big or small, the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been deprived ofit for 30 years by the Soviet Union. Whilst all Australian Governments hitherto have not recognized the Soviet sovereignty over these States, the Prime Minister has now made a single handed decision to grant such recognition. The undersigned peutioners wish to express their concern and dismay and humbly beg that such a decision be reversed. And your petiuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Clyde Cameron. Petiuon received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled. The petition of the Undersigned, being citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth: That we strongly oppose The Family Law Bill, 1974, which is being introduced into our Federal ParUament by The Honourable The Attorney General, Senator Lionel Murphy, because of the absence of protection for the human ditional consitution as the basic unit, the ostensibly permanent unit ofhuman society. We oppose the Bill because of the omission of a clearly defined clause like that which is incorporated in The Universal Declaradon of Human Rights, and which declares that both men and women shall have equal rights in marriage and that Parents shall have the right to choose their children's education. We oppose the Bill which is accredited to Senator Murphy, because either of the panies to a marriage, if the Bill becomes law, will have no defence, i.e., no legal objection, to a divorce which might be desired and instituted by the other law, there is no justice, tion of the traditionally accepted standard of marriage and the Family, ticeable backward step in the civilisation of Australian people. Whilst we oppose the Bill for above mentioned reasons, we see it as expressing the views of a minority of citizens or their Representatives, instead of the views of the majority of Australians. Therefore, passing of this Bill. And your peuuoners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Kevin Cairns. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parhament assembled: The humble peution of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the Human Rights Bill Baltic States (a) Insofar as it attempts to legislate regarding the exercise of religion and religious observances, is in contravention of Section 116 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, (b) Will tend to deprive free Australian citizens of religious libeny and freedom of worship, and parents and guardians of the right to choose the moral and religious education of their children in that: (1) The Government could introduce regulations as to the ume, place and manner in which people may manifest their religion and beliefs. (2) The BUl excludes the recognition of the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, and its right to protection by society and the State, (3) The Bill does not explicitly recognise the liberty of parents, and when applicable, legal guardians, to ensure the religious and moral education of their children. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House not proceed with the Human Rights Bui. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, Family Law Bill by Mr Hodges. Petition received. Television and Cinema Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament Assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:family in its natural and traThat grave concern is felt regarding the quality of television and cinema. That many of the films shown are detrimental to the healthy development of the character of the young people of our nation. That the low moral standards in many films are repulsive to many viewers. Your petitioners, therefore humbly pray, that the Government will take measures to upgrade the quality of television programmes and ban the undesirable films from our cinemas. party. In this conception of by Mr Lloyd. no humanity, and no recogniPetition received. but there is a tremendously noBaltic States To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: the views of an individual, or The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: we beg the rejection, and not the The undersigned petitioners wish to express their concern and dismay at the announced decision of the Prime Minister of Australia to recognize the annexation of the three Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviet Union. We submit that these once free and independent States were occupied by force of arms following a secret agreement between Hitler and Stalin and that the Australian Government's recognition of such Soviet annexation Human Rights Bill amounts to approval of the said agreement and of aggression and beg the ParUament to disallow such recognition as a matter of principle. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Young. Petition received. INDIA'S NUCLEAR TEST",17
3,Mr DRURY,"I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has received details of the nuclear bomb explosion testing reported to have taken place in India about 3 months ago. As the success of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty depends on the effective containment nuclear testing, I ask whether Australia has any protest.",19
4,Mr WHITLAM,The Government has been immoral in touch with the Indian Government about the peaceful nuclear explosion which it conducted.,19
5,Mr ANTHONY ,What ! A peaceful one!,19
6,Mr WHITLAM,"An experimental explosion I to develop the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Needless to say the Government is disappointed that the Indian Government acted as it did. Australia is not the only government which is disappointed that India so acted. In particular, we have been in touch also with the Canadian Government and the American Government General about it I have been in personal correspondence with Mrs Gandhi about it. All I should add is that we do not believe that the long sustained effort which many nations have made to secure acceptance for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been in any way assisted. It may, in fact, have been set back by the Indian experiment. MAINLINE CORPORATION",19
7,Mr JACOBI,"I address my question to the people Minister representing the Attorney-General. It in relation to the Mainline Corporation. Minister aware of reports that Mr R. T. Baker, Managing Director of Mainline Corporation, has been involved with the Endurance Mining Co. which has been the subject of investigation the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Comset mission? Is it a fact that the report of the mission has been suppressed? Will the Minister request the Attorney-General to obtain a copy of the report, and will he further take steps to ensure that the report is made public?",19
8,Mr ENDERBY,"I have seen reports such as capital have been referred to by the honourable member. I tliink it would not be proper to make comment on them at this stage, but one can be concerned about the lessons that can be drawn from a situation such as was revealed by the Mainline incident. As was pointed out, I think by the Prime Minister yesterday, in a speech he made in this House, some of the greatest corporations, some of the most eminent and highly placed businessmen in AustraliaMONICA",19
9,Mr WHITLAM ,Insuranc e companies and banks.,19
10,Mr ENDERBY,"Insuranc e companies and people, whose solvency and liquidity is just not in issue and never could be in issue, for reasons of achieving their purposes put together a corporate device to extend and further those purposes. of When the corporate device failed to serve the made purpose to their convenience, they allowed to happen what did happen. I beheve it can only be thought and said that there is something quite about corporate behaviour or the use of the corporate screen-the limited liability company-in that way when it brings such hardship on so many people. So far as the direct aspect of the honourable member's question is concerned, do not know whether the report was suppressed or not, but certainly it is my belief that it was never made public. 'Suppression' seems to be a fair comment and I believe that such reports should be released and made public so that the public themselves can be better protected. I will be happy to communicate with the Attorneyand put a strong suggestion to him along the lines put by the honourable member. CAPITAL GAINS TAX",19
11,Mr STREET,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. When a farm property passes in direct succession to children or a surviving spouse, will the person or persons to whom the property is assigned be Uable for capital gains tax in addition to estate and probate duties? If such are liable, will the amount of capital gains is tax levied be allowed as a deduction in calculatIs the ing estate and probate duties?",19
12,Mr CREAN,"The other evening when this matter was mentioned in the Budget Speech, I by indicated that a memorandum was available that out in broad detail some of these problems. I Comthink the honourable member will understand that these are matters of some complexity. As for as farm property is concerned, I hope he will appreciate the fact that valuation day was on Budget day. I doubt, listening to the whingeing of farmers, whether any of them anticipate great gains on their properties in the immediate future, but I would suggest that when the relevant Bill is introduced somewhat later in the only session these matters will be dealt with. Mr Snedden-What is your intention? Surely you must be able to say whether capital gains tax will be deducted from the value of the property.",19
13,Mr CREAN,"I am not like the Leader of the Opposition, who makes statements with precision in areas where you cannot be precise. I think the honourable member for Corangamite will acknowledge that he scarcely asked what might be called a precise question. Mr Snedden-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. If the Treasurer did not appreciate that the question was precise, perhaps the honourable member for Corangamite could re-ask the question so that the Treasurer can hear that it is cise question.",20
14,Mr CREAN,I would be happy if that were done.,20
15,Mr STREET,"Mr Speaker, I asked: When a farm property passes in direct succession to children or a surviving spouse, will the person or persons to whom the property is assigned be liable for capital gains tax in addition to estate and probate duties? If such people are liable, will the amount of capital gains tax levied be allowed as a deduction in calculating estate and probate duties?",20
16,Dr FORBES ,Eve n I can understand it.,20
17,Mr CREAN,It must be terribly simple. All I am suggesting is that the question is not as simple as that. The capital gains tax would not be payable by the person to whom the property was assigned; it would be paid by the person who presumably had died. Mr Snedden-How could a person who has died pay tax?,20
18,Mr CREAN,"Apparently honourable members oppositefindthis subject to be a matter of jest. I would submit with all respect that the Leader of the Opposition knows nothing whatever about the matter. As has been indicated, I have merely shown in broad outline what the situation will be. There are going to be some difficulties administratively.",20
19,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: Would it be possible, with the permission of the Treasurer, for the question to be redirected to the Minister for Overseas Trade?",20
20,Mr SPEAKER,Order! No point of order is involved.,20
21,Mr CREAN,"I took it that when the honourable member for Corangamite, whom I respect, asked the question he asked it seriously. I cannot say that I appreciate the tactics of either the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Wannon in relation to my attempt to answer the question. All I am suggesting is that it is not easy to be precise about the matter. The honourable gentleman referred to a property which had been assigned. I am not quite sure when the assignation took place. Then he referred to probate, which implies the death of some party.",20
22,Dr FORBES ,Estat e duty.,20
23,Mr CREAN,"Or estate duty, but not gift duty. The honourable member for Corangamite did not say gift duty; he said estate duty. So at least there has been the death of a party. I am not like a prethe honourable member for Barker; I do not think it is quite as simple as that. From what the honourable member for Corangamite said I am not clear who assigned the farm to whom and at what stage. With all respect I would suggest that it is the sort of question on which the honourable member could have given me some notice or which he could have placed on notice so that I could give him a much more precise reply. Mr Snedden-But you must know whether any capital gains tax paid is deductible.",20
24,Mr SPEAKER,Order! Interjections are out of order. The question has been asked by the honourable member for Corangamite.,20
25,Mr CREAN,"Capita l gains tax, if one wants simplicity, is payable on any realised gain from 18 September. I am suggesting that the matter is not clear-at least it is not clear to me. I may be duller than most, and maybe it is my understanding rather than his phrasing that has caused the difficulty, but from the question asked by the honourable member for Corangamite, it is not clear to me at what point and in whose hands the capital gain is supposed to have crystallised. The honourable gentleman went on further to talk about an estate duty, presumably also in relation to the same capital gain. I must say that I am not clear from the question what I am being asked. COMMUNIST PARTY OF AUSTRALIA",20
26,Mr ANTHONY,"I ask the Prime Minister What action has he or his Government taken in response to the announcement by the President of the Communist Party of Australia, Mr Mundey, that the Communist Party is planning a national strike next year? Is a close watch being made of the Party's activities?",20
27,Mr WHITLAM,My colleagues and I gave the declaration as much attention as it deserved. The communist parties-ther e are about 3 in Australia at the moment-hav e never been so poUticaUy insignificant and we beUeve that the trade union movement has never been in better hands. HOUSING INDUSTRY ACTIVITY,20
28,Mr REYNOLDS,Has the attention of the Minister for Housing and Construction been NA the Housing Industry Association that there is a serious downturn in activities in the building industry? Does the Minister's assessment of the situation coincide with that of this gentleman?,21
29,Mr LES JOHNSON,"I have seen the stateNA enough to send it to me together with a personal letter, which I appreciated. He contended that there is a serious downturn, as the honourable gentleman suggested. In fact he has been contending that for a longtime-virtually since this Government came into office. There is a tendency for people to project such dire developments and consequences for the building industry prematurely. The facts of the matter are that we have just recently concluded afinancialyear in which more houses were built than have ever been built before in one year in Australia's history. That is the fact of the matter. Indeed, the first 18 months of this Government's period of office have been responsible for a very great output ofhouses. Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, the Minister should make a statement about this matter after question time. We would be quite prepared to give him leave to make a statement. Why should he take up question time with false propaganda?",21
30,Mr SPEAKER,I have repeatedly made appeals in this House for questions and also answers to be shortened. I ask the Minister to be as brief as possible in his answer.,21
31,Mr LES JOHNSON,"It is very difficult to be very brief and give a meaningful answer on this matter. I shall certainly make it as brief as I can. I can understand the honourable gentleman's sensitivity. We could take a great range of figures under various headings-approvals , commencements, houses under construction and completions-and under every one of those headings the performance of this Government is superior to that of our predecessors. This is why the honourable gentleman does not like to hear too many facts. Just in regard to completions, in the financial year 1973-74 under this Government 153,000 houses were completed. In the previous year under the previous Government, 143,000 houses were completed. I believe there is a downturn in the building industry. The Government believes that this is the situation. As a result steps have been taken stimulate the industry with massive injections funds. This has been done firstly through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. It has been done certainly in respect of Defence Service, Aboriginal housing, housing in the Territories, aged persons' housing and in many other ways, including the proposal to establish a new housing development corporation. Many initiatives are being taken by this Government to meet the situation as described by Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, clearly the Minister is defying your ruling to keep answers short. I said that he could have leave to make a statement. He can speak for an hour if he wants to after question time.",21
32,Mr SPEAKER,Order! I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that I did not give a ruling but made a request. No Speaker has had the power to ask anyone answering a question to terminate that answer. I can only appeal to the Minister to keep his answer as brief as possible. I again appeal to the Minister for Housing and Construction to keep his answer as brief as possible and to terminate it as quickly as he can.,21
33,Mr LES JOHNSON,"As is my custom, Mr Speaker, I will be very pleased to do so. Finally, I draw attention to the announcement made by the Treasurer to the effect that bank lending will be eased as a result of the proposed change in the 60-40 ratio which I understand will release some $ 1,200m for home lending over the long term and that in the shorter term still more money will be made available by the reduction from 10 per cent to TA per cent of funds required to be held by the Reserve Bank of Australia. So I can see some stimulation coming through these initiatives. If necessary the new housing corporation will have the facility to inject more funds to sustain the buoyancy of the housing industry. PORT OF NEWCASTLE",21
34,Mr OKEEFE ,"Can the Minister for Transport tell me whether there has been a considerable and unreasonable delay in loading and unloading ships and tankers in the port of Newcastle? Has this been caused by strike action of key unions involved? Is it a fact that as a result of this action transport and industry in northern New South Wales have been paralysed through lack of fuel, and valuable export income from grain and other produce has been threatened? What future action do the Minister and the Government intend to take to improve the turnround of shipping in the port of Newcastle?",21
35,Mr CHARLES JONES,I have made the to statement on numerous occasions that the Ausof tralian Government is prepared to accept responsibility for the operation of Australia's ports. If the honourable gentleman refers his question to his own Party which is in government in New South Wales and which is completely and totally responsible for the operations of port activity in Newcastle and in every other port in New South Wales he might get his answer. Until such time as the New South Wales Government is prepared to transfer its responsibility to this ment I am afraid that it will be responsible for the turnround of ships and the operation of the ports. EDUCATION: NON-GOVERNMENT,21
36,Mr LUCHETTI,Has the attention of the Minister for Education been directed to criticism of the Australian Government in respect of nongovernment schools and charges of discrimination which should be answered? Are these charges vahd and will the Minister make a statement in reply to the criticism?,22
37,Mr BEAZLEY,"In the lastfinancialyear the Australian Government's expenditure on nongovernment schools was $70m. In the estimates of the grants to the States-an which grants are made to non-government schools-the expenditure for this financial year is $120m. This is a rise of $50m, which is an way of discriminating against these schools. In addition there is $20m unallocated as between government and non-government schools in this nnanciai year compared with $2m in the nnanciai year- a tenfold increase. The amount going to either sector will depend very upon innovations. There is also another important non-government sector of educationdraw mission schools. In the last financial year the grants to them were $295,000. In year they will be $1,282,000. The honourable member making these criticisms was burking the issue, but I do not want to accuse him of modelters ling liimself on his hero, Edmund Burke. GEORGI ERMOLENKO",22
38,Mr KILLEN,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I ask the honourable gentleman: Poes he hold the belief that Ministers in his Government are bound by the rule of law and obliged to respect the processes of the law? If honourable gentleman holds that belief, what explanation is forthcoming to explain why a son, namely Georgi Ermolenko, was taken out of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Western Australia when habeas corpus proceedings before that Court, and Ministers knew it?",22
39,Mr WHITLAM,"As to the first part of the question, yes, of course I hold that beUef. the second part, this matter was very fully debated in the Senate yesterday and a motion expressing the view of the questioner was not carried. The situation is that the Western Australian Supreme Court- I forget all the details-clearl y could take any action it saw fit against any person in Australia, including an Australian GovernGovernment Minister. The Supreme Court of Western Australia has not seen fit to take such action. MAINLINE CORPORATION",22
40,Mr INNES,"Is the Minister for Housing and SCHOOLS Construction aware of claims by Mr R. C. Baker, Managing Director of the Mainline Corporation, that the Government did not try to save the Corporation because the Government is opposed to free enterprise?",22
41,Mr LES JOHNSON,I saw the statement. I resent it because the facts areMONICA,22
42,Mr LUSHER ,"I take the point of order, Mr Speaker. The question asked requires a yes or no answer. The question was whether a statement d that is the way in was made.",22
43,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. A Minister may odd answer a question in whatever way he chooses.,22
44,Mr LES JOHNSON,"The statement is resented because a number of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minislast ter, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development and myself took a great interest in much this matter. Some of them, with theirMONICA",22
45,Mr WENTWORTH ,"On a point of order, Sir, I attention to standing order 145 which is, this financial very succinctly, reads: An answer shall be relevant to the question.",22
46,Mr SPEAKER,Order! All answers by Minismust be relevant to the questions. I ask the Minister to keep to the relevancy of the question.,22
47,Mr LES JOHNSON,"Not only those Ministers to whom I referred worked assiduously on this matter but also a number of departmental heads were concerned. The Government had a very great interest in trying to save this company. The view was taken that we should try to rescue the the construction part of the company, but the accounts and other factual material relating to perthe company were kept in such an unintelligible way that it was very difficult to find the information we required to enable us to rescue the conwere struction part of the company. We made a number of proposals. At one stage the receiver, Mr Jamieson, came As to to see me and in fact made an announcement to the effect that he would stave offthe date of the company's going into Uquidation so that the Government's good intent could be further examined and our efforts could proceed. We actuaUy studied the prospect of making funds avaUable to sustain Mainline's construction mdustry. All that was offered to us was an openended proposition which no government could justify. I regard the statements made by Mr Baker as a very cruel Ubel in the circumstances where the Government made every possible endeavour to bring about the satisfactory rescue operation. If his own affairs had been more conducive to the rescue of the company our efforts could have been successful. ACADEMIC SALARIES",22
48,Mr CONNOLLY,Did the Special Minister of State issue a Press statement on academic salaries on 14 July last in which he stated that: . . . the Government had agreed that Mr Justice Campbell would undertake an interim review of salary of academic staff in universities. Did the Press release conclude with the following statement: The Minister said that the Government expected to consider Judge Campbell's interim Budget discussion.,23
49,Mr SPEAKER,I remind the honourable gentleman that he is not permitted to quote from a newspaper report in asking a question.,23
50,Mr CONNOLLY,It is a Ministerial Press release.,23
51,Mr SPEAKER,"WeU, who is going to substantiate whether it is the correct statement made?",23
52,Mr CONNOLLY,I have the text in front of me.,23
53,Mr SPEAKER,Ver y well.,23
54,Mr CONNOLLY,"Would the Minister advise the House why he and the Prime Minister failed to give Mr Justice Campbell specific terms of reference in July last, thus effectively delaying the mquiry? Why did he promise to consider academic salaries in the context of a pre-Budget discussions if this was clearly not his intention? Is the interim inquiry presently considering academic salaries? When does the Minister expect the report to be tabled in Parliament?",23
55,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,"The significant factor and of the whole of the report of the Remuneration Tribunal is that it was disallowed in another House. No doubt the honourable member took part in a ballot in his own Party would do in relation to that disallowance. NaturaUy, when the report was disallowed, Mr Justice CampbeU felt it would be improper and inappropriate to proceed with any determination without statutory support. The reason nothing has been done with respect to academic salaries is due directly to the activities of the Opposition. It is because of that, as the honourable member would know if he looked at today's notice paper, that we are to introduce a Bill to amend the Remuneration Tribunal Act, which will allow for academic salaries to be so determined. I am very confident that if the Opposition wiU give its support and the proposed legislation becomes law His Honour will then proceed with that interim determination. PROPOSED FUEL AND ENERGY LEGISLATION IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA",23
56,Mr BENNETT,"My question is directed to levels the Minister for Manufacturing Industiy who represents the Attorney-General in this chamber. Is the Minister aware of the tragic situation in Western Australia with respect to the proposed provisions of the Fuel and Energy Bill now before the Western Australian State Liberal report in the context of its Government's Parliament which, it is alleged by the Law Society of Western Australia, State politicians and community leaders in that State, will remove civil liberties of Australian citizens? WUl the Minister clarify how the provisions of this Bill affect the civil liberties of Australian citizens? Will the Minister clarify what protection is afforded the legal and civil rights of Australian citizens acting in Western Australia in disputes under direction by Federal organisations in respect of national decisions which cause the invoking of the penal provisions of that Fuel and Energy Bill? What protection can be offered to Australian citizens who go to Western Australia to carry out duties on behalf of a national body from the threat of the appUcation of the provisions of the West Australian Act arising from the duties which they perform?",23
57,Mr ENDERBY,"I have had an expression of concern made by the CouncU of the Law Society of Western Australia brought to my notice by the honourable member, and I thank him for it. It has also been brought to the attention of the Attorney-General. The facts seem to be that this proposed legislation would have very serious adverse effects on the whole question of civil liberties were it to become law. The time has not been available to enable it to be analysed or studied in detail, but some aspects can be as to what it touched on briefly. For example, the Bill is drafted in extremely wide and vague terms such as certainly would not survive close scrutiny in our Senate. In addition, it makes provision for inspections of premises without warrant. The questioning of persons is also provided for in it. It has certain unsavoury retrospective elements which would constitute an attack on civil liberties. If it law in its proposed form some acts done before the making of regulations would be rendered criminal subsequently. I understand that the Bill also contains provisions for declarations of states of emergency. It has to be said, however, that there is talk of amendments, so one can only hope that flexibility and good sense will prevail. As far as national organisations are concerned, the honourable member's fears are quite correct in that those organisations would be caught by the provisions were they to become law. It should also be said that the proposed law would certainly be in breach of many of the provisions of the international covenant on civil and political rights. ACCOMMODATION FOR THE AGED",23
58,Mr HEWSON,"I ask the Minister for Social Security whether he has given any consideration to the present plight of committees of management of homes for the aged or institutions which are in the process of building home units for the aged. Is he aware that the upper cost Umit is preventing further units being built because of the inflationary tender prices being obtained and that the Umit is also making the increase of the government capital subsidy from $2 for $1 to $4 for $1 of almost no benefit at this stage? Has the Minister made any decision to bring the upper cost subsidy Umit up to the reaUstic figure so that plans and specifications already tendered can proceed? If so, what is that figure?",24
59,Mr HAYDEN,"I will be even more emphatic that the movement of the subsidy from $2 for $1 to $4 for $1 is of absolutely no benefit at this stage, because it has not been introduced yet. I released a statement in Perth at the weekend indicating that the Government was considering these matters and that a working party from Treasury and the Department of Social Security was investigating the problems which were confronting voluntary agencies providing this sort of accommodation. When the report comes to hand- I hope it will be quite soon-the Government can give consideration to the assessment that is presented and make a pokey decision then. ELECTORAL ACT",24
60,Mr RIORDAN,My question is directed to the Minister for Services and Property. Has his attention been drawn to certain reports criticising proposed or suggested amendments to the Electoral Act deaUng with optional preferential voting and redistribution of electorates? I ask the became Minister: Is there any substance in the allegations which have been made?,24
61,Mr DALY,"It is true that the Government proposes to announce shortly that a redistribution of electorates will take place and that there will also be proposals for the introduction of optional preferential voting. It is also true to say that the Leader of the Country Party has criticised these proposals in a most unjustified way. Dealing with redistribution of boundaries, the last redistribution took place in 1968. Another one should have foUowed the census of 1971, but the LiberalMONICA",24
62,Mr ANTHONY ,"It should not. He is dishonest, this fellow.",24
63,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of the Country Party will contain himself. Mr Katter-Why does he not tell the truth?,24
64,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Kennedy will withdraw that statement. Mr Katter- I withdraw the statement.,24
65,Mr DALY,"Anothe r redistribution was due after the 1971 census but the Liberal-Country Party, at the instigation of the Deputy Prime Minister at that time, decided to sidestep the redistribution and even denied Western Australia the additional seat to which it was entitled. Western Australia did not get that additional seat until Labor came into office. The situation is that nearly every electorate in Australia is out of kilter. For instance, in New South Wales, MitcheU has 83,000 on the roll and Darling has 47,000; in Victoria, Diamond Valley has 87,000 and Wimmera 49,000; in Queensland, MCPherson has 91,000 and Maranoa 47,000. Those figures give an indication of the disparity that exists in electorates. Undoubtedly, because of the faUure of the previous Government to take action in this regard, a redistribution is a longtimeoverdue. I might say, in answer to the Leader of the Country Party, that a redistribution commission is to be appointed. The commission will be appointed in accordance with the Act, which has not been changed in respect of the appointment of commissioners since the Liberal-Country Party was in government. Men of the highest personal integrity will be appointed on the same basis and by the same methods as were adopted by the Liberal and Coimtry Parties. In these circumstances it is strange to hear the Leader of the Country Party rejecting the proposals before they have been announced. This only goes to show that the Country Party will go to any length to maintain the malapportionment of electorates in the interests of political survival irrespective of democratic principles.",24
66,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is a widespread understanding that the Minister already has been responsible for draft maps being drawn and if that is soMONICA",25
67,Mr SPEAKER,That is not a point of order. The honourable member willresumehis seat. Mr Nixon- I take a point of order. My point orderrelatesto the fact that on his return from Canada the Minister said what the boundaries were going to be.,25
68,Mr SPEAKER,The Chair is not in a position to know what is said by Ministers or their ments. No point of order is involved.,25
69,Mr DALY,The Leader of the Country Party would be better advised to inform the House how his Party perpetrated the greatest gerryvotes mander in history and elected in Queensland a Country Party Premier whose Party secured only 19 per cent of the votes. He should do this instead of criticising. He could also explain the Liberal-Country Party Government in New South Wales has maintained itself in office by the gerrymandering of electorates based on the Queensland set-up. I turn now to optional preferential voting. The Leader of the Country Party quoted the case of Great Britain and gave certain figures. Great Britain has a past the post system.,25
70,Mr ANTHONY ,It is the same as you are doing.,25
71,Mr DALY,"Ah, the same thing! Optional preferential voting means that a person will called upon to vote only for the number of didates for which there are vacancies in order register a formal vote. However, if a person desires to vote for all candidates in order of preference he has that right. The proposal is not to change the system but to simplify the method of voting. The Chief Austrahan Electoral Officer, a man of the highest personal integrity, assures me that as compared with the present system this will not change the result of elections once in years. That is the answer direct to the Leader the Country Party. The Leader of the Country Party should know that between 1919 and 1931 tory governments which his predecessors supported had this system in Austraha for Senate elections. In 1958 his Government introduced it for the Advisory Council elections in the Australian Capital Territory, and it is still in force. In addition we have introduced this system for the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory Assembly elections that are imminent. His Party never opposed the proposal. So what is the position? What is the purpose of this hillbilly stuff the Leader of the Country Party is putting to the Australian people? In the last Senate elections for this ParUament there were 73 candidates in New South Wales. In every State there were massive numbers of candidates. The informal vote throughout Australia of totalled about 800,000 or 10 per cent of the votes. So it is necessary for us to do something to make the voting method simpler. In New South Wales there were 332,000 informal votes; in Victoria, 230,000; in South Australia, 82,000; in Western Australia, 60,000; in Tasmania, 26,000; departand in Queensland, 65,000. Consequently almost 1 mUUon people had no say in what government was elected, irrespective of their poUtical opinions. They were not uninteUigent people. Many intelUgent people cannot record for 73 candidates without making a mistake. The optional preferential method of voting, far from being introduced to assist any party, is to make certain that by a simpUfied method of how voting every Australian willregistera vaUd and formal vote. The Labor Party seeks by aU its electoral proposals only to see that the candidate or Party that secures the majority of votes gets the question of the majority of seats. I can understand the ill-judged criticism of the first Leader of the Country Party. The whole history of his organisation is one of opposition to electoral reform. When in government he insisted on holding this portfoUo for his Government for the sole purpose of avoiding democratic elections be and majority rule. The Leader of the Country canParty and his Party have too many skeletons into their poUtical cupboards on questions of electoral reform to be taken seriously. I believe that the Australian people agree that a simplified voting method is essential in the interests of democratic elections, and that is precisely what the Labor Party is endeavouring to do, both by means of redistribution and the simplification of the voting method. We aim to give the people a 100 say in the government of their country and not of deny it to them as the Liberal and Country Parties have done for generations. CAPITAL GAINS TAX",25
72,Mr CREAN,I would like an opportumty to clarify my understanding of the question asked by the honourable member for Corangamite.

NATIONAL ESTATE Ministerial Statement",26
83,Mr UREN ,"Reid-Minister for Urban and Regional Development)-by leave- I join with my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass) in tabUng the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate. Before outlining to the House the noble concept of the National Estate which is enshrined in the report, I want to express my personal pride and satisfaction in its contents. It was a concept which I devised and pubUcised in the days when I was the spokesman on the environment and urban and regional affairs for the Labor Party in opposition. During the years between 1969 and 1972,1 put particular stress on ^identifying the National Estate and promoting it as a key part of Labor Party poUcy. In the pohcy speech of the Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) in December 1972, he promised that a Labor Government would enhance and preserve the concept of the national estate. As a Government, we have acted swiftly to discharge the mandate given to us to identify, conserve and preserve the National Estate. In April last year, Dr Cass and I announced the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, with Mr Justice Hope as Chairman. The other members of the Committee were Reginald Walker, the Federal Executive Member of the National Trust; MUo Dunphy of the conservation groups; Judith WrightMCKinney, a poetess and a great environmentalist; Mr Len Webb, of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; Mr David Yencken, a progressive builder from Melbourne; Mr Keith Vallance, a Tasmanian businessman; and Judith Mary Brine, a university lecturer from South Australia. The Committee began its work at the end of May last year. It considered more than 650 submissions from Government, community and professional bodies, and from individuals.The Committee travelled widely, looking at important parts of our national heritage and so enriching its insights into the concept of the National Estate and how it should be identified and preserved. Its report was received by us in April this year, and its findings and recommendations were announced by the Prime Minister at the end of April. Now the full report has been printed and we are glad to be able to put it before members of the Parliament. The central theme of the report on the National Estate is set out in this extract from itsfindingsand recommendations: The Australian Government has inherited a National Estate which has been downgraded, disregarded and neglected. All previous priorities accepted at vanous levels of Government and authority have been directed by a concept that uncontrolled development, economic growth and 'progress', and the encouragement of private as against public interest in land use, use of waters, and indeed in every pan of the National Estate, was paramount The report goes on to confirm that this Government is the first Administration to make a commitment to charting the National Estate and conserving it, particularly for younger people and AustraUans of the future. I cannot stress too strongly that the Australian Government is determined that our National Estate will no longer be degraded and despoiled The Committee has devoted a great deal of work to defining with precision the things that make up the National Estate. It has opted for a very wide ranging definition of the National Estate which can be summed up in this way: Elements of such outstanding world value that they need to be conserved, managed and presented as part of the heritage of the world; elements of such outstanding national value that they must be conserved, managed and presented as part of the nation as a whole; and elements of such artistic, social, historical, cultural or other special value to the nation or any part of it that it should be conserved, managed and presented for the benefit of the community as a whole. This very broad definition of the National Estate includes elements of remarkable diversity and richness. The range of the National Estate extends from great national parks and awesome rain forests to a simple stand of trees or patch of coastline. It includes the remaining treasures of our colonial architecture and such homely parts of the national heritage as paddlesteamers and even a Chinese joss house. A pleasing feature of the report is its rejection of the widely held notion that conservation and preservation of the environment are a 'middle class' issue. The Committee affirms this is just true and that preserving the National Estate concerns us all. It shatters once and for all the illusion that the national estate is the preserve the better-off members of the community. The forces which threaten our National Estate often bear most heavily on the less privileged. Poorer people suffer more intensely from the loss of parkland, familiar city and country scapes, and even dwellings. Deprived commumty groups have not the same access as the wealthy to other sources of personal enjoyment and fulfilment. That is why it is often the less affluent who are most active in working to protect the best features of our heritage. That is why the trade union movement has been active in trying to protect and enhance our National Estate. The pillage and neglect of the National Estate diminishes us all in equal measure. I also want to make it plain that I seek the support of people of goodwill whatever their background in protecting the National Estate and passing it intact to future generations. We will work with all those who want to protect those parts of our heritage that have been created by man or nature and are unique or are things of beauty. I want to make it clear that the Government has not been idle while it waited for the report the Committee of Inquiry. In the last financial year more than $2m was provided to help the State governments and other organisations prestrive serve the National Estate. In the Budget now fore the Parhament, for 1974-75, this has been lifted to $8m. We have also announced our intention to establish a National Heritage Comfirmly mission to administer our pohcy on the National Estate. This was one of the more important recommendations of the Committee. This Comment mission will be responsible to the Minister for the Environment and Conservation and myself. We expect that legislation to set up the Commission will be put to the ParUament in this session early in 1975. In the meantime a 17 member ing interim committee has been set up to help bridge the gap between the Committee of Inquiry and the proposed Heritage Commission. The Comthe mittee is headed by Mr David Yencken who perand formed valuable services as a member of the Committee of Inquiry. I refer honourable members to the attention given by the report to the role of the Australian Government in fostering the national estate. number of new roles have been Government. The Committee's broad recomnot mendations cover land use planning, conservation and reservation techniques and the principles of national parks. They extend to the of impact of mining, forestry and coastal development on the national estate. Thereportalso proposes a nationalregisterof sites of historic and scientific interest, and measures to protect and preserve important Aboriginal sites. No future Government will be able to ignore the impact of the report and its impUcations for the careful planning of future pubUc poUcy to safeguard the national estate. The work of Mr Justice Hope and his Committee deserves the highest praise of this Parliament and aU Australians. We are also grateful for the help and co-operation given by State and local government authorities, by a host of voluntary organisations, and by hundreds of individuals. AU have helped in the great task of developing and refining the concept of the National Estate. The report of the Committee is a symbol of the great physical and cultural heritage we have been fortunate enough to inherit. Now we must act with firmness and vision to ensure that future generations will not lead their Uves satisfied with a National Estate which we have spoUt. Finally, it gives me some personal pride that an idea drawn from my own plulosophy and personal feelings, and reflecting the ideals of great of socialists of the tradition of WUliam Morris, should bear fruit in this noble concept and this fine report. In the spirit of the report we wiU to create and preserve things and places of begreat beauty for aU AustraUans and for the AustraUans that foUow us. Such a great sharing of beauty and culture among all of our people is based on the contents of this outstanding report. I urge honourable members to give it detaUed study and assure them that the Governwill act positively on its recommendations.",27
84,Mr HUNT ,"Gwydir)-by leave- Iriseto welcome the tabUng of this report. I am sure that all or honourable members will look forward to studyit in depth. In passing, I take the word of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren) that it was he who gave the lead to Australian Labor Party, to the Government to the nation. It is certainly not a modest observation but one which could well be true. If it is true aU credit must go to the Minister. The report is a monumental document and appears to be beautifuUy illustrated and is certainly printed and pubUshed in a manner that is not usuaUy evident in suchreports.I join the MinisA ter in congratulating Mr Justice Hope and others suggested for the on the Committee. I am glad that the Government is acting to establish a National Heritage Commission. The National Estate report not only recognises the need for the preservation of historic buildings and things like the Chinese joss house that was mentioned in the Minister's speech, but also the natural environment. I refer to the recommendations in the land use planning section. I quote this pan so that it will be incorporated in Hansard. The Committee recommends: To protect and conserve the natural environment requires conservation to be part of the normal planning and development process. A proper land-use inventory and over-all regional land-use plan, keyed in with the inventory, Therefore we recommend: that the Australian Government give its full suppon to, and discuss with the States possible help to them in up procedures for land-use inventories and regional landuse planning. Second, planners, designers, construcnon authorities and developers generally should accept the principles of'design with nature' and act accordingly. We recommend: that the Australian Government seek to ensure as far as possible that land-uses are planned and decided in harmony with natural forces and conditions and not against them. I think that is probably one of the keys to the recommendations of the total report. I have felt for some time that too often in the environment protection field we have been treating the causes of abuse rather than trying to establish an tory so that proper land use decisions can be made. I do not think that any poUtical party can accept the blame for what has happened. I know ment. that in New South Wales, for instance, after the last war it was the Australian Labor Party Government that introduced closer settlement to the western areas of New South Wales and gled carved up blocks of land that were far too small for adequate pastoral activities. We have seen great areas of western New South Wales virneglected. tually rendered a desert. It appears that several Departments have a sponsibility and also a responsibUity to Uaise with each other in order that many of these the recommendations can be achieved. One recomwe mendation that I think is worthy of note is the composition of the 17 member interim comtate. mittee. It is composed of Federal pubUc servants and other interested persons. If it is to exclude State public servants I think a great mistake being made. The report itself spends a lot of in deaUng with the constitutional constraints. quote a section of the report which states: Some parts, and indeed imponant parts, of the Estate are in the Territories, or, although within are owned by the Commonwealth, but the greater pan National Estate is within the general legislative control of the States. So it would be a great pity if the interim committee did not have State Public Service representation. If we are to make any real impact on this problem we need the co-operation of the States. The Minister exalts his own socialist plulosophy and assumes that sociahsts have a monopoly of the concern for the National Estate. He quoted that great capitalist who had socialist behefs, WUUam Morris. WUUam Morris had one great advantage in his writing days; he was writing in a cosy provincial environment which had are vital. been man-made for more than 400 years. I make that significant statement because it was the desire of all political Parties in Australia and setting indeed of the Australian people after the last war to develop Australia at an undreamed-of pace.",28
85,Mr UREN ,The WUliam Morris I am talking about is an Englishman.,29
86,Mr HUNT,"I know. I am not talking about an Australian. The WUUam Morris the Minister talked about was a very wealthy socialist and he Uved in an environment where 400 years of man made effort enabled him to assume the sort of statements and writings that he was able to produce. I relate this to the Australian scene. We have witnessed a great era of growth that has generated the wealth that has improved the invengeneral living standards of the Australian people. It is against that background that we can afford now to protect and conserve our environPerhaps one of the most unfortunate parts of the Minister's speech was that in which he sinout a section of the report to quote. It states: The Australian Government has inherited a National Estate which has been downgraded, disregarded and It is very easy to say these sorts of things. But what that report did not say was that the Ausretralian people, during this period of growth, had their Uving standards Ufted to equal the best in world. It is only because of that situation that can now turn our attention to preserving and conserving the environment and the national esSo let us keep our ideas in perspective. We should not hesitate to respect and protect our great national heritage for future generations. is This report and its recommendations should give time us the lead. We are one of the last developed I nations to have a large part of our environment left virtually in its natural state and it is up to all National men and women, not just the sociahsts, to prethe States, serve as much of it as is economically and of the socially possible. That is the key to the whole apStates and so is subject to the proach. There has to be a balance. I am sure that the implementation of the recommendations against that background of consideration will to the long-term benefit of the Austrahan people. ALLEGED INDEMNITY PAYMENTS INVOLVING MARITIME UNIONS Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",29
87,Mr SPEAKER,"I have received a letter from levy the honourable member for Wannon ( Mr lected Malcolm Fraser) proposing that a definite matthe ter of pubhc importance be submitted to House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government, in formulating of reference for the Royal Commission into alleged nity payments involving maritime unions, to include: (1) Charges that the Minister for proved the indemnity payments 12 months ago. (2) The silence of the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Transport from 26 early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments. (3) The failure of bom Ministers to take appropriate action under the law. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)MONICA",30
88,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"Wannon) correspondent (11.12)-This debate is taking place today cause of the Government's determination to the debate yesterday on the same matter. I say without any equivocation that propriety in this Government, and if the Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) were concerned for the name and integrity ofhis Government, he would widen the terms of reference of the Royal ComFederationmission which is investigating alleged indemnity . payments involving maritime unions; he would give the Royal Commission an overriding mandate to pursue every aspect of this matter. Royal Commission should be permitted to examexplained ine every one of the unions that might be volved so that the good name of the Government and of the overwhelming bulk of the union movement can be cleared from the charges and state: the smell of the incident created by the aUeged activities of Mr EUiott and the Seamen's Union. corporate As part of that process of purging itself there or would be no honourable course open to the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) other to offer to the Prime Minister his resignation which could be held in suspense until the matter had been cleared, proved or disproved one or the other. But that is not the Government. That would not be the practice of this Minister who wiU try to cover this matter just as significantly as other matters have been states: covered up in other places. But I only suggest be that the matter will be pursued in one way or another and that one day the facts will become plain. Charges have been made by Mr EUiott against the Minister, and the charges are very clear. He said that the Minister produced the idea of the on ships and the way in which it is being coland that this came out of a discussion in Minister's office over a year ago. On the one the hand we have the word of the Minister who sought to deny that and the word of Mr EUiott the terms who said that that is what had happened. But indemthere is information and it is my understanding that Mr ElUott beUeves he can prove that charge Transport had apagainst the Minister. There is other circumstantial evidence to indiJuly to cate that Mr EUiott is indeed correct. When questioned on 5 September by James Ramsden of the 'Australian Financial Review' the Minister said that in his office in that discussion with Mr ElUott he had liimself tentatively raised the idea. If he had tentatively raised the idea and admitted that much there starts to be circumstantial evidence in support of Mr ElUott's charge. But the Minister's statements seem to be odd and contradictory, because 5 days later in front of the same on 10 September, in discussing bematters relating to the Waterside Workers Fedgag eration, the Ministerfirstof all said: What I know has been going on, and I indicated to if there were any Charley FitzFor the uninitiated, the Minister was referring to Charley Fitzgibbon of the Waterside Workers . . that so far as I was concerned he has no risk of me taking any action against him, or his union . . .",30
89,Mr SPEAKER,"Order! I should like to The remind the honourable member that, as I yesterday, in my opimon the terms of inreference of the Royal Commission cover matters pertaining to the Waterside Workers Federation. Paragraph 1(b) of the terms of reference The circumstances under which and the persons, including bodies, by whom or to whom any such payments demands have been made. than The Waterside Workers Federation is a corporate body. It is my contention and my ruling that a discussion of matters relating to payments being way made to the Waterside Workers Federation practice of this would be out of order.",30
90,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,"Mr Speaker, I up was speaking to point No. 1 of my motion which Charges the Minister for Transport had approved indemnity payments 12 months ago. Indemnity payments do not relate only, as you very correctly said, to the maritime unions. The Elliott terms of reference, as I hope you correctly say, cover the Waterside Workers Federation as well. paid Point No. 1 of my motion is that the Minister for and Transport had approved indemnity payments 12 months ago and that this matter examined. You have ruled discussion on this matter to be in order. The point that I was makIDepartment, ing was that there is significant evidence in Mr Labor, aboutand Elliott's statement of the activities of the Seaalternative men's Union and in other pubUshed reports that the Minister had approved indemnity payments allow not only concerning the Seamen's Union but also concerning the Waterside Workers Federation. It is that point that I was seeking to demonstrate by this quotation and no other. The Minister there would indicate a knowlalternative. edge and an approval of what was happening the Waterside Workers Federation just as Mr EUiott claimed that he had approved what was happening in relation to the Seamen's Umon. But at a later point in the same interview the Minister said: I repeat, I am unaware of any levies that have been That was about 3 minutes after he said that he had approved what in fact had been going on. The Minister has virtually condemned out ofhis own mouth. There is evidence from his own mouth that he has been involved and that he knew about these matters. He took no action and there was implicit approval therefore what was happening. That is thefirstpoint that I sought to demondeep for strate. Then we have the question of the sUence wUd, not only of the Minister for Transport who is commission principally culpable in this matter but also of the which Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde ters Cameron). It needs to be pointed out that the for Transport. Minister for Transport chaired a meeting late in inadequate terms May where a number of problems in relation to mention of the three this industry were discussed. Significantly there is the notice of the House a letter that was sent to the Minister and Immigration on 26 July. As a result of that this kind. They did not do so.the letter there was no evidence of any kind of action the matter with the ACTU inquiry, tried or activity by the Minister for Transport or by the would seem to have been broken. Itbut Minister for Labor and Immigration until the also that the sUence of the Ministerswould matter inadvertently appeared in the Press in what Melbourne about six or seven weeks later. The letter clearly drew attention to the fact that April this year the unions led by Mr ElUott made attempts to disrupt arrangements agreed between the Minister for Transport and the executive of the Australian CouncU of Trade Unions. The letter then describes the activities the Seamen's Umon, which have been widely reported, and the demands of the Seamen's Union. I would Uke to quote 2 paragraphs. Thefirstis: has now made a new demand that the difference in money amount between ITF rates and Australian rates be 4 proportionately into the funds of the seafarers union not to the ship's crew. He also stated that the money will not be returned to the ship's crew, but retained by the unions 'so as not to undermine the national economy'. ought to be The letter also states: have informed Mr Ray Taylor of the Federal Transport Mr John Limbrick of the Department of the matter. They cannot see any practical with relation to the present incident . . . That refers to making indemnity payments to the ships to sail. This letter is signed by Mr Henry and addressed to the Minister for Labor on 26 July. It directly impUcates the Departments of both Ministers. Officers of the Departments of both Ministers had said that there is no That means that officers of the in Departments, against whose integrity I would not put a slur for one moment, knew that both their Ministers would do nothing about this particular matter. Those officers knew that the Minister for Labor and the Minister for Transport would not be prepared to act under the law as struck. they ought to act, and they therefore had to say that there was nothing that could be done except to pay the extortion. This is part of the price of the cover up of the two Ministers and part of the himself price of sUence of the 2 Ministers. No doubt they hoped that they might be able to get over this particular matter by the statefor ment of having an ACTU inquiry, but that was not to be enough. The matter was running too that. To prevent the inquiry running they then sought to have a restricted royal with restricted terms of reference certainly and positively would direct matcase away from the activities-inactivit y in the of the Minister for Labor-of the Minister Therefore we had an inquiry, with of reference, which makes no points which are brought to on this occasion. Both for Labor Ministers ought to act under law in matters of They to hide the law seem condoned in fact had occurred. since In a statement that the Minister for Labor did had make about this matter he condemned the action because of the direction of the funds, because they were going to a special fund. He did not condemn the extortion or the indemnity payof ments. He only condemned the direction of the money. I do not suppose he condemned that part of the direction of the money which put $5,000 into the election campaign funds of the Australian Labor Party. Let us look at the charge that the Ministers did not take appropriate action under the law and that this is a matter which ought to have been examined. Three laws are involved in this particular matter. The first is the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Under section 152 of that Act unions are required each year to make an accurate statement of all receipts and expenditure and put in that statement to the Industrial Registrar. It is quite clear that that not been done and that action ought to be taken under the Act, under the hand of the Minister for Labor and under the hand of the Industrial Registrar. Secondly we have the Crimes Act which, one would think, prima facie has been breached. Section 30K of the Crimes Act is designed to protect interstate trade and make it possible to lay charges against the persons or organisations that obstruct or hinder the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States. Again there are words in that Act which would seem to imply that the activities of the Seamens Union have been quite unlawful. Thirdly we have the Navigation Act which requires that seamen involved in the coastal trade be paid proper rates and not rates less than those normally paid to Australians operating in Australian ships. Sections 288 and 289 of the Navigation Act spell out very clearly that every seaman employed on a ship engaged in any part of the coasting trade shall, subject to any lawful deductions, be entitled to and shall be paid for the period during which the ship is so engaged, wages at the current rates ruling in Australia for seamen employed in that part of the coasting trade. Quite plainly, on the evidence that has been made available to the Ministers, the Seamens Union has said to the companies concerned that the money is going to come to it. The money is not going to go to the seamen concerned. The unions and Mr Elliott have exhibited utter callousness in relation to people on low rates of pay and they have conspired and extorted to make sure that those parts of the Navigation Act are in fact broken and not held. Therefore there were three possible courses of action that the Ministers jointly could have taken. They could have launched normal police action because of a violation of laws. Much of what the Minister for Labor has done has sought to put above the law certain militant unions-no t all, but certain ones which are most concerned to use their strength mercilessly against their own members and the people of Australia. By their failure to act in these particular instances, by their failure to uphold the law as it stands, by their attempts to cover this matter with an inadequate inquirynot inadequate because of the Commissioner but inadequate because of the terms of reference and because of the attitude of the Ministers and of this Government-the two Ministers have done great harm to propriety in government. They have destroyed their own reputations, particularly the Minister for Transport who clearly, on has the evidence available has been involved in these matters in one form or another for significantly more than 12 months. On this basis one would have hoped that the Prime Minister might examine the evidence and take the course which I suggested at the outset. There is no other way in which the Prime Minister can preserve integrity for his Government. This matter runs through and into the Departments. It involves the two Ministers. They were given evidence. Laws are available. They have ignored the law. They have brought the law into disrepute allowing unions to operate outside the law. If that is to happen and it is to increase control of this government by people like Mr Elliott industrial anarchy will become rampant throughout the Australian community.",30

94,Mr CHARLES JONES,"I thank honourable members. We have listened to a lot of garbage this morning from the honourable member for Wannon ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). I wish to draw attention to the report from the Select Committee Appointed To Inquire Into And Report Upon Payments To Maritime Unions dated September 1958. This Committee was appointed by the Liberal-Country Party Government. If honourable members wish the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee to be incorporated in Hansard I shall be quite happy to do so. I wish to draw attention to paragraph 66 which states: The Committee's general conclusions are that the evidence discloses acts of a highly improper character in the nature of conspiracy, extortion and intimidation. The Liberal-Country Party-the then government-ha d a majority on that Committee. What did it do about that report? The answer is a very simple one. It did nothing, notwithstanding the Committee's general conclusion that the evidence disclosed acts of a highly improper character in the nature of conspiracy, extortion and intimidation. The Liberal-Country Party Government did nothing about it. Liberal-Country Party members should not come in here with all this pious humbug about what the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and myself have allegedly done. I deny most emphatically that I have been involved in anything improper. I have not been involved in anytliing like, for example, Jetair. The honourable member for Wannon was a Minister of the Cabinet that was involved in that stinking, rotten episode called Jetair. He was a Minister of the Government whichMr MCLeay-You are a disgrace as a Minister.",33
95,Mr CHARLES JONES,I know members of the Opposition do not like it. It hurts them.,33
96,Mr SPEAKER,Order! I ask the Minister to keep within the terms of the motion before the Chair. The honourable member for Wannon was received in complete silence; I ask that the Minister for Transport be afforded the same courtesy.,33
97,Mr CHARLES JONES,"Mr Speaker, I will endeavour to keep to the points to which you have referred. But, you know, Alexander Barton, Jetair, Billy MCMahon-and all that crowd who are going to speak on this-the honourable member for Wannon and the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon)-don' t talk of such about anything that is putrid and rotten; you still stink from the smell of Jetair. changes are necessMONICA",33
98,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,I rise on a point of order. The remarks of the Minister for Transport are quite offensive. I ask that they be withdrawn. The charges that I made were precise and based on evidence and on the Minister's own words. He cannot hide behind a stream of abuse.,33
99,Mr SPEAKER,"I ask the Minister to keep to the point before the Chair. If my memory serves me correctly, the honourable member for Wannon also used the words 'it smells', which I do not think are quite parhamentary either.",33
100,Mr STALEY ,'It stinks'.,33
101,Mr SPEAKER,Order.' I ask the Minister to moderate his language in regard to these matters and to use parUamentary phrases.,33
102,Mr CHARLES JONES,"Mr EUiott has made a statement-the honourable member for Wannon repeated it-whic h is not true. It is perfectly true that I did meet a delegation of seamen's representatives including the State secretary for New South Wales, Mr Benson, in my office some time last year, perhaps August or September of last year. I saw him there. I met that delegation about 10 months ago. It is perfectly true that I said that I was contemplating imposing the condition, as the Navigation Act seeing that the honourable member for Wannon has mentioned it-permit s me so to do, under which a single voyage permit can be issued. I indicated to that delegation that I contemplated doing this. Honourable members opposite say that they want to see facts. I am not afraid of the facts. I was pleased for one simple reason that this discussion did not come on yesterday. That reason was that my file was in the hands of the Royal Commission in Sydney. All of this information that I now show to honourable members is in the hands of the Royal Commission. I am quite happy with the inquiry, however it goes. But the time avaUable to me today is very limited, so I had better get stuck into what I have to say. The facts are that on 30 July 1973 I approved the issue of a single voyage permit for the carriage of detergent alkali by the 'AUied Trader'. One of the conditions of that approval was 'approved subject to Australian rates'. Do honourable members want to have a look at that document? There is a photocopy of the original which I show to honourable members opposite. I am quite proud of the fact that I imposed this condition that Austrahan rates of pay were to be paid. Not only did I impose that condition on that approval but also I did the same thing with respect to another ship a httle later. The carriage of a cargo of pyrites from South Australia to the north-west shelf was involved. Unforiunately, this permit was not taken up. It was issued to the 'Lady Vivian'. That was a condition on which approval was granted. I required that Austrahan rates should be paid and Austrahan conditions apply with respect to that approval. Those dents occurred prior to the September meeting. Because I was not satisfied that these moneys would be paid to the crews and that they could retain these sums, I discontinued that practice of imposing the condition that Austrahan rates of pay had to be paid to the crews of the ships to which permits for single voyages were issued. I tell honourable members opposite today that if l could be certain that the crews being paid that money could retain it, every single voyage permit that I issue would be subject to that condition. Do not let us have any qualms about that. I emphasise the point that the money would be paid to the crew and not go into any funds. My colleague, the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has made a similar statement. If you fellows opposite beheve in cheap labour conditions, I hope the honourable member for Gippsland will come out and substantiate that view. There is nothing illegal in what I have done. The Navigation Act provides that I can impose conditions, and I do impose them. I repeat: When I am certain that the money retained by the crew, permits will be issued with that proviso. Do not let us have any illusions about where I stand in respect of issuing such permits. I do not beheve that this money should be paid into any secret fund to be administered by individuals. All of the money that I am talking about would be paid to the crew. Either that would be done or the Government would impose a levy which would be subject to pubhc audit. there is anything wrong with that proposal, up and say so, and just say whatMONICA",33
103,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,This is what happened.,34
104,Mr CHARLES JONES,I am not concerned overseas with what has happened.,34
105,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,That is just it; we are.,34
106,Mr SPEAKER,Order! I repeat that the The honourable member for Wannon was heard in pay complete silence. I am gojng to ensure that Minister for Transport is'treated with the courtesy.,34
107,Mr CHARLES JONES,Thank you. I do not mind them mterjecting.,34
108,Mr SPEAKER,I do.,34
109,Mr CHARLES JONES,"You might do. The facts are that, when I say that I am not concerned with what has happened, I am saying that I am concerned about matters with respect to which I give approval. I do not approve of all that has happened in the course of recent events. I did not approve of that and I took the appropriate action 2 inci- as I will show honourable members in my remarks in the next couple of minutes. An incident was brought to my attention on approximately 12 November last year. I was asked to issue a single voyage permit for a ship, the 'Manchester Viga' which was loading containers ex Discovery Bay at Fremantle for Melbourne. I was asked to issue a single voyage permit for this ship on the advice of my Department that it was an onward movement where cargo had been taken off some ship, dumped, and then was to be picked up later on and carried on. I was advised- I have the full advice here-that a single voyage permit was not necessary, and I did not issue one. Let me explain how events turned out later after my involvement in the whole situation ceased. I received verbal advice which I beheve was of a confidential nature from the ship owners to the effect that they had paid money to the Seamen's Union, which was then to be paid into the 'Noonga' fund. I had nothing whatever to do with that. It was not my responsibility. It was a matter between the ship owners and the unions. I repeat that it was nothing to do with me; the issue of a single voyage permit by will be me was not involved. I know and honourable members opposite know that for years shipping companies and the unions have been making all sorts of deals. I know from my own experience that members of my own union have been given extra time in order to get ships out of the road, and to complete work on them and to get repairs done. If Those are matters, as far as I am concerned, beget tween the ship owner and the unions. The next incident which came to my attention occurred immediately I returned from my visit in July. This matter involved the issue of a single voyage permit for the carriage of oil. As far as the permit being issued was concerned, it was recommended to me that I issue a permit. union had insisted on full Austrahan rates of being paid to the crew of this particular ship. the We were led to beheve that by arrangement besame tween the union and the Ampol Company that company had agreed to pay the union one per cent which would go into union funds. That matter had nothing whatsoever to do with me. It was a matter between the union and the company. The company was making no complaint whatsoever about the matter to me. The first matter which was brought to my attention in this respect was the case of the 'Sloman Alstertor'. I received a telex in my office at Newcastle from the agents for that ship. They sent me the telex which I now hold in my hand. I will give the House the details ofit. If honourable members wish I will incorporate it in Hansard as I have not time to read it. I ask for leave to do so.",34

Mr Dent first brought this matter to my attention August. On 19 August he indicated to me that the vessel delayed by industrial action at Fremantle. Only after ment of $1074.92 had been made to a bank account nated by the Seamen's Union was the vessel permitted sail. For your convenience, attached. On 23 August, I received a message from Mr A. C.

Department have been advised verbally of other having been made by the Seamen's Union under the of industrial action. In recent weeks payments to men's Union have been made by Ampol Petroleum Ltd and Australian Newsprint Mills in respect of the 'Prima Maersk' and 'Thunderbird' respectively which had been issued with single voyage permits for the carriage of interstate coastal cargo. In the case of'Thunderbird', the vessel is at present waitMining to berth at Melbourne to discharge newsprint from Hobart but, according to the Shipper, the Seamen's Union has indicated that tug assistance will not be made available until further payment is made. In each of the cases which have come to my notice the paysought by the Union has been related to the difference the wage rates normally payable to the crew and rates which would apply if the crew were on Australian Articles. Although a receipt is held by Refrigerated Express Lines and Australian Newsprint Mills for the payments the Union there is no indication that the crews of the have received any additional remuneration during the period of employment on the Ausualian coast. In relation to the attached representations from Mr Dent, view is that he should be guided by his legal advisers the course of action he should pursue in seeking to recover the payment made to the Seamen's Union. I would not proto offer any advice on how he should proceed on the I would propose therefore that we should examine the measures available to the Government to prea repetition of the Seamen's Union demands. You may that, in thefirstinstance, perhaps it would be appropnate for oflicials of our two Depanments together with officers the Attorney-General's Depanment, Depanment of and Immigration and the Depanment of Treasury to meet next week with a view to preparing a repon on the possible courses of action open to Government. you agree, I suggest you write to the other Ministers I mentioned in the terms of the attached draft letter. Yours sincerely, CK. JONES being The Honourable E. G. Whitlam, QC, M.P., Prime Minister, Parliament House, Canberra, A.C.T. 2600 Parliament House,",38
136,Mr CHARLES JONES,"I thank honourable 24 August 1974 members. On Saturday, 24 August, after the Cabinet Budget discussions had concluded I sent the letter and recommendations to the Prime received Minister. He was then away for a week and I was (Ausaway for 4 days. When I returned to my office on of the Monday, 2 September, at about 9 a.m. my colleague the Minister for Labor and Immigraon 9 tion ( Mr Clyde Cameron) rang me in Newcastle was in relation to this matter and put to me the proppayosition that we should have a royal commission. I nomiimmediately agreed to this proposition and the to result is that today you have a royal commission. copies of the correspondence are It is the wish of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and Immigration and myself that this 'Sevillan matter be fully investigated and exposed. Evicircumdence will be taken at the inquiry, unlike the inquiry set up by the Liberal-Country Party Officers of my Government in 1958 when people who tendered demands evidence were not subject to cross-examination threat by those affected by their evidence. The first the Seaparagraph in the recommendations of that comcoastal voyaging by mittee states that fact. As far as I am concerned personally, I have never stopped moving on aU this information. As I receive the letters I refer them to people who are there to give the necessary legal advice on what can and should be done and what the recommendations are. I am not a lawyer and I cannot give you that legal advice. When these papers are produced for pubhc inspection and cross-examination at the royal commission it will be shown that at no time have the Department of Transport and its Minister accepted and tolerated payments of this type being made into any fund. To the crews of the ships, yes. And I ask the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) to say that he is opposed to the crews being paid this sort of money. I agree that International Transport Federation rates should be paid to all crews of international ships. It is part of the pohcy of the Labor Party and the trade union movement. It is true that I told Charlie Fitzgibbons, who is a personal friend of mine, both being Newcastle men, that there was no risk of any interference by me or any prosecution or action being taken against his union while it was insisting on the crews of foreign ships being paid ITF rates of pay. I challenge the Opposition to dispute that, to say that I was wrong and that they should not get ITF rates of pay. That is the situation as far as I am concerned. I have no evidence, no proof and no knowledge of any money having been paid into secret funds-that is, as far as ITF rates of pay are concerned. I have been completely truthful and above board. Never for a moment have I tolerated a situation where money was obtained by means that could be referred to as blackmail or anything else.",38
137,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Minister's time is has expired.,39
138,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"Mr Speaker, I rise on point of order. The Minister for Transport has said that the indemnity payments to the Watermember side Workers Federation will not attract action so far as he is concerned. Sir, you ruled that the Waterside Workers Federation was the included in the terms of reference of the royal commission. Is it not necessary for the Minister clarify for the House whether the Waterside Workers Federation is included in the inquiry especially as there is evidence, by Mr Fitzgibbon's own words in some newspapers, that $125,000 of the money coUected did not to ships'crews?",39
139,Mr SPEAKER,The Chair is unaware of what took place outside this House with respect payments. Mr Charles Jones- I am unaware of what Fitzgibbon has said to the Press.,39
140,Mr NIXON ,"Gippsland) (11.51)-I will go into the details of the last point in a moment but firsdy I shaU deal with something that the Leader of the House ( Mr Daly) said when we moved for the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) to have an extension of ume in which to finish his remarks. The Leader of the House made the most miserable excuse possible for curtailing this debate by suggesting that we were cutting into private members' time on Grievance Day. The fact is that he would not enable a censure debate to be held on 23 August when we sought it nor would he bring it on on Tuesday. He permitted that debate yesterday which forced us to raise this matter of public importance today, so cutting into private members' time. The fact that he is not prepared to support the Minister for Transport in answering the serious charge made against him is a disgrace. The Minister for Transport commenced his speech by referring to a 1958 report and making various allegations about what the Liberal and Country Parties may or not have done as a government. The honourable member for Wannon ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) made specific aUegations. This case cannot rest on what the Minister has put before the House today. The aUegations have not been answered in sufficient detaU. He has not explained the tardiness of his approach to the question or the tardiness of the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron). Let me explain to the House what this matter is aU about. The facts are that extortion payments have been demanded and made. This clear from aU the evidence avaUable to us from newspapers over a period oftime.In fact I can quote from the chief extortionist of all, ElUot V. a ElUott, who said that they had demanded that the difference between the wages paid to each of the crew of the 'Thunderbird' and any the rate that would have been paid for Australian crews, including leave entitlements for period, be paid. The point is that Elliot V. Elliott did not demand that those payments go to to the crew. The Minister for Transport supports the idea that such payments should go to members of the crew. Elliot V. ElUott asked that these payments be paid into a certain bank account of the Seamen's Union. As the honourgo able member for Wannon rightly pointed out, a letter from the Austrahan Newsprint MUls Limited goes so far as to name the number of that Seamen's Union bank account. It is S090091. to any The Australian Newsprint MUls paid $18,000 into that account. There are allegations in subMr sequent newspaper articles of amounts up to $70,000 being paid. Mr Charles Jones- I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. The honourable member is referring to Mr Henry's letter of 26 August.",39
141,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"No , July. Mr Charles Jones-The letter the honourable member for Wannon mentioned was dated 26 August and I received that on 29 August.",40
142,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,The letter I quoted was written on 26 July.,40
143,Mr NIXON,The letter to which I am referring is dated 30 July and is entirely different. It is addressed to Mr H. Souter of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions. I will have it incorporated in Hansard if the Minister so desires. Mr Charles Jones-All right.,40
144,Mr NIXON,It is included in Hansard.,40
145,Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member must have it incorporated in the correct manner. He must seek leave. I ask him not to forget the Chair.,40
146,Mr NIXON ,I seek leave to have that letter incorporated in Hansard.,40
147,Mr SPEAKER,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)Dear MrSoutar, Further to our conversation sel 'Thunderbird', I enclose Federal Minister, Mr Clyde Cameron, on 26 July and telex sent to him on Monday, 29 July. explanatory. Later on Monday, 29 July, Elliott advised Mr Deane of Hetherington-Kingsbury of a resolution by the Seafarers Unions that the difference in money amount between tralian rates and leave provisions and ITF rates visions applicable to crew members of the 'Thunderbird' whilst engaged on the Australian coast be paid weekly account No. S090091 of the Seamens Union by bank cheque. In doing so Elliott rejected any event, this should not apply for the seven days during which berthing of the vessel had been held up by Elliott's actions. A payment of SI8,000 by means of a bank cheque made by Hetherington-Kingsbury to Elliott on July companied by a letter reading somewhat as follows: Further to our conversation on Monday, 29 July enclose a bank cheque without prejudice and on the understanding that vessel 'Thunderbird' will be enable it to discharge newsprint. The cheque relates to portion of the difference in money amounts between Australian rates and leave provisions and ITF rates and provisions appUcable to crew members of the vessel 'Thunderbird' whilst engaged the carriage of newsprint between Australian ports. Your receipt is requested. We understand EUiott has now advised firemen deckhands that it is in order to benh the 'Thunderbird' the vessel is expected to discharge newsprint in Sydney on 31 July. Deane has been unable to obtain from Elliott any confirmation of the reasons for his demand and he has in fact refused to do so. Whilst Hetherington-Kingsbury's letter protects them to some extent, the action by EUiott is, in my opinion, one of the most unsavoury I have yet encountered for the following reasons: 1. As arranged several years ago with the Waterside Workers Federation, represenung the ITF, if a request is made to augment ITF rates to bring them up to Australian rates, the amount has always been paid to the ship'screw. 2. On this occasion the crew of the 'Thunderbird' could make such a request and this would lead to double payment by Hetherington-Kingsbury unless all sums paid to the Australian Seamen's Umon are recovered. 3. In the absence of any written statement or acknowledgment by ElUott the payment to the Seamens Union could be regarded as a bribe, a Christmas present, or whatever they Uke to caU it. I have never heard of any simUar demand, but understand it is not unusual for the Seafarers Unions to be paid 'slush money' when overseas vessels are engaged in the carriage of Australian goods between Australian ports and amounting to 1 per cent of the freight rate. Yours sincerely, R. W. Henry Managing Director",40
148,Mr NIXON ,"I thank the House. I might say, Mr Speaker, that there is no way by which I could forget your presence. You remind me of your presence every time. I make a speech in this on 30 July concerning the vesHouse. copy of a letter written to the",40
149,Mr SPEAKER,"I tliink it is always needful These, I think, are self that I do.",40
150,Mr NIXON,"I do not wish to debate that, Sir. The fact is that there have been worse allegations Ausinvolving higher amounts. One such allegation and prowas made by Mr Fitzgibbon himself. It appeared in numerous newspapers throughout Australia into but I quote from the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 11 September wherein the following appears: a suggestion by Deane that, in The Waterside Workers Federation has coUected at least $370,000 from ship companies paying wages below international rates. was From what Mr Fitzgibbon has said the money 30, acseems to have been spUt. Some of it went to the crews-$125,00 0 is in doubt-bu t the remainder 1974, we is not explained. Where does that money go? for $ 18,000. This amount is paid the That is the point the Minister for Transport has released immediately to not explained.",40
151,Mr HUNT ,Does it go to the Labor Party?,40
152,Mr SPEAKER,"It is true that the Minister for in Transport made some passing references to some matters but I do not want the honourable member for Gippsland to debate them. As I and ruled earher, reference to any matters covered by and the terms of reference of the royal commission is out of order. If the honourable member examines the contents of this matter of pubhc importance he will see that it does not include anything that touches on those terms of reference. I ask the honourable member for Gippsland not to refer to payments made to the Waterside Workers Federation because that matter is covered by paragraph (b) of part 1 of the terms of reference.",40
153,Mr NIXON,"I accept your assurance that the Waterside Workers Federation is covered in the terms of reference. I am deUghted to hear it. However, it runs contrary to what the Minister for Transport said. This is the point I am trying bring out. The Minister said that the Waterside Workers Federation has nothing to fear him as Minister; in fact, he is setting out to tect it. I refer now to an article by James Ramsbring den which appeared in the 'Austrahan Financial Review' and which the Minister has not denied. The Minister has not denied the accuracy of that article in which it is claimed that the Minister said he would protect the Waterside Workers Federation. We need clearly to know that the terms of reference are as you, Mr Speaker, have indicated. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Gippsland is distorting what I said. What I said to Mr Fitzgibbon, the Federal Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, is that whenever his union takes action to insist on ships' being paid ITF rates of pay he can expect attack from me.",41
154,Mr SPEAKER,I think every honourable member should read what appears on the blue program sheet. They would then be satisfied what the letter the honourable member for non submitted to me is all about. The subject matter of this matter of pubhc importance should be adhered to. I have explained why. The Australasia honourable member should not refer to anything that may prejudice the hearing of this matter fore the royal commission. After long consuldid tation with other people I have ruled that graph (b) of part 1 of the terms of reference covers the Waterside Workers Federation be that cause it is a corporate body.,41
155,Mr NIXON,"I do not want to intrude on the actions of the royal commission. ing to get is clarification from the Minister of various points. The Minister has not satisfied the Opposition as to his own actions or his tardiness. The Minister for Labor and Immigration apparside ently knew of this letter at the same time-th ter from the Australian Newsprint MUls-ye t did nothing about it. Perhaps we will hear from him what action he proposes to take. The Minister for Transport has explained what he did on one or two ships. He lost interest in the levy after that point of time. The fact is that by losing interest in the levy which was to go to the crew he removed the one salutary thing that may have allowed the Seamen's Union to keep those conditions operative, namely, that any levy raised would go to the crew. The Minister for Transport has said that on 2 ships he made sure that the money went to the crew. But then he seemed to lose interest. From that point of time the Minister has been tardy in his responsibUity. He has to explained his actions in relation to only 2 counts. He has a lot to account for. That is why we are from interested to know whether the terms of proreference of the Royal Commission wiU clearly out the whole of the facts relating to aU of the ships that have been involved in this issue of indemnity payments. It is a plain extortion racket. They are no more or less than bribes. This is one of the worse examples that we have heard of in Australian maritime history of such actions. This matter is under the direct responsibUity of the Minister, but he has not been informative enough in telling us all the detaUs about it. The fact is that the Seamen's Union gave $5,000 to the Labor Party's slush fund. We have seen a photograph of Senator Murphy collecting the cheque. But that is not the only point. The point is that 7 or 8 other unions are involved crews apart from the Seamen's Union. The other no unions are the Marine Cooks, Bakers and Butchers Association of Australasia, the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association of Australasia, the Federated Shipwrights and Ship Constructors Association of WanAustraUa, the Merchant Service GuUd of Australia-it shocks me to see that union includedthe Professional Radio Employees Institute of and the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers. How much money behave those unions been paid? How much money the Labor Party get out of them? We want to paraknow whether the terms of reference of the Royal Commission will bring to Ught the reason the Minister for Labor and Immigration has been so tardy in his action in handling this matter. Is it because of the money paid to the Labor Party's slush fund that the Government has been What I am tryso tardy and loath to move? (Extension of time granted.) One other point needs to be made. We on this of the House aUege that the terms of e letreference which have been drawn up for this he inquiry are too narrow. The Australian Council of Trade Unions wanted to hold its own inquiry into this matter. I am not at all convinced that Government did not elbow the ACTU to one side so that the Government would then control the inquiry. This is not a reflection on Mr Justice Sweeney. I have the greatest respect and regard for him. I am concerned about the limited terms of reference under which he is allowed to work. Why the ACTU was elbowed to one side, the interplay of union rivalries and the dislike for the Minister for Labor and Immigration are all matbate. ters which could be brought to the fore and would be able to obtain a certain amount of information. But the narrow terms of reference of the Royal Commission may not allow that information to come out. For that not sure whether one of the reasons for elbowing the ACTU to one side was so that the Government itself could control the inquiry by limiting the terms of reference.",41
156,Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,What additional terms of reference would you suggest?,42
157,Mr NIXON,"I would like a term of reference that specifically goes into the reasons for the tardiness of the Minister for Labor and ImmirgaThe tion in handling this matter. Almost every newspaper in this country has printed a leading article to the preaching of the immoraUty of affair by the Minister for Labor and ImmigraMinister tion. Yet it took him 7 or 8 weeks to move on it. He did nothing. Yet his own Department was informed about it on 26 July by means of the ter by wbich the Department of Transport was also informed. I have grave suspicions about Umited terms of reference of the inquiry which will not give the Royal Commission the right look at the tardiness of the Minister for Labor and Immiigration in relation to this matter the performance of the Minister for Transport Tasmama. and the narrow actions that he took. I accept the explanation given by the Minister for Transport for what he has done. What I do not accept is what he has not done and what he has not that explained to this House. That reference ought to be drawn on a much broader and wider basis. What has happened to this slush that has gone to the Labor Party? We have only one pubhc example of a fat cheque going the Labor Party? It is a serious aUegation that am making but the proof is there. The fact is that a photograph was taken of the representative the Seamen's Union handing a cheque to the Ermolenko? Australian Labor Party to be used for the last election campaign. How much more money to the Labor Party election campaign? much money did the other unions put in? How expired. the wide is this total extortion racket? There is no way in the world that this Royal Commission, with the terms of reference that it has, can get a picture of the total extortion rackets that are going on under this Government. For all the vague allegations that might have been made by the Minister for Transport about the activities of the last Government, there is nothing to equal the specific charges that have been laid in this deThe Minister for Transport is as culpable as we the Minister for Labor and Immigration. When he repUes let us not have from the Minister for Labor and Immigration one of those glib speeches in which he says nothing. We want ansreason I am wers to the charges. If the Minister does not answer the charges he will be found guuty by the Australian people. I have no doubt that one of the grave reasons that the shipping compames did not complain was that the Minister for Transport shrugged his shoulders and said: ""This was a deal between the ship owners and the unions and I have nothing to do with it.' He shrugged it from his shoulders. ship owners were unable to complain because they knew darned well that under this Minister nothing would be done, that their ships this would be tied up at the wharves and that this would do nothing but protect the unions. The Minister has a great habit of protecting the unions. He is prepared to take on the letQantas hostesses and growl about their salary rises and make aU sorts of allegations about how the they got them. He is prepared to take on the Qantas pUots. He is prepared to support the use to of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft to take a Russian back to his commie friends. But he will and not use an RAAF aircraft to break a strike in",42

GRIEVANCE DEBATE 62 Care of the Aged-Proposed Fuel and Energy 52 Legislation in Western Australia - Question proposed: That grievances be noted.",45
195,Mr WILSON ,"Sturt) (12.25)-There is an aged care crisis in the community. There is an urgent need for something to be done in the aged care area. Many of the people in the community who are operating organisations concerned with care for the aged expected that in the Budget, there would be some recogmtion of their needs, Cameron, Donald Connolly, D. M. but they were disappointed. It is true that the supplementary benefit in respect of nursing home care was increased on 1 August. But all Edwards, H. R. Erwin, G. D. that did was enable patients in nursing homes to afford the fees that then reflected the cost of operating those nursing homes. My concern today is for the patients. Those patients are going from onefinancialcrisis to another because of the Government's failure to recognise in the Budget the need to announce that nursing home benefits should be index related. A study of the Howard.J.W. Hunt, R. J.D. figures on nursing home fees since 1 August indicates quite clearly that, as a consequence of rising costs, fees are getting beyond the level that a pensioner can afford to pay for proper nursing home care. Whenever one hears that nursing home fees have risen it is very easy to think that those who are operating the homes are putting up the fees in order to make a substantial profit. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that nursing home fees are controUed. Nursing homes can raise their fees only if the increase is approved by the Department of Social Security. That DepartPeacock, A. S. Robinson, Eric ment has been examining many claims by nursing home operators-som e private and some combined charity and benevolent organisations - to justify increased fees and it has granted the increases because the fact is that over recent months the costs of operating nursing homes have escalated at a rate far in excess of the consumer price index and there are still further increases in the pipeline. Many of the nursing homes run by charities and benevolent organisations were nearly bankrupt in July. Because of their plight, the Government took temporary action. But aU it did was to release a tourniquet that had been tightening to strangulation point. The Government gave no indicauon of when nursing home fees would be again increased. Many nursing homes expected something to be done in the Budget. But if we look at the Budget we find that there is talk about deficit budgeting. If one studies the words and the papers attached to the Budget documents one will find that the Government expects to spend a mere $1.8m over and above thefigureit anticipated spending on 1 August when nursing home benefits were increased to bring them to a realistic level. It is quite clear that the Government does not intend to increase nursing home benefits between now and August of next year. I challenge the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Hayden) to deny that that is so. If he is able to deny that it is so, why did he not include in the Estimates contained in the Budget a provision for greater funding of nursing homes? The provision of a mere additional $1.8m in funds for nursing home care for the aged will go nowhere. The Minister has said that he wants to enable the charity and benevolent organisations which are operating nursing homes to provide greater facilities. It is not a question of their being able provide greater facihties; the crisis is that they will not be able to provide the facihties that they now offer to many thousands of needy people. He speaks about deficit budgeting as though the non-profit organisations are the only nursing homes that provide for pensioner patients. The facts is that 80 per cent of all patients in nursing homes are pensioners. The former Liberal-Country Party Government set in motion machinery that was designed to update nursing home benefits so that a patient with a pension income could not only afford reasonable accommodation but be left with some spending money equivalent to one-quarter of the standard rate pension plus supplementary assistance. What has this Government done? It has reduced the amount of spending money available to the pensioner from what it should be today-from $8.75 to $4. That $4 is now insufficient to cover the costs of the large number of nursing homes that are forced, because of wage claims, to charge fees in excess of what is commonly regarded as the standard fee- a fee calculated by adding the nursing home benefit and the proportion of pension income supposedly allocated to the cost of nursing home care. The figures show quite clearly that since 1 August a large number of nursing homes have sought fee increases and have been granted them. To imagine that they are the only fee increases that will be granted between now and next August is to bury one's head in the sand. It is clear therefore that the Minister is showing a lack of care for thefinancialwelibeing of the aged. I am constantly telephoned by people in great distress. As a result of the fact that people cannot afford the cost of adequate care in nursing homes many are driven into unlicensed boarding houses where they pay their pensions for poor accommodation, inadequate food and inadequate medical care. In the meantime the nursing homes, whether they be privately run or charity run, are endeavouring to keep their heads above water financially. Many of these organisations which hope to expand the facihties that they can offer to the community and to offer accommodation and care to the people now in the second grade boarding houses are not willing to go ahead with their building programs. They are unwilling to take the financial gamble of being forced into a situation of near bankruptcy. Today many of these organisations are confronted with the knowledge that further wage increases are in the pipeline. For example, in South Austraha under a recently negotiated to award for domestic staff the domestic staff are to be paid an additional $4.15. AppUcations for an additional week's leave for certain nursing staff are before the court. A new sister's award is to be handed down. Inflation in other cost areas is rapidly forcing up prices. I urge the Minister in the interests of the patients and in the interests of humanity to announce that he will index relate the benefits so that they can be increased automatically as approval is given for fees to rise. If the fee rises are approved those fees are justified by the evidence and the Minister should be able to announce that additional benefits are avaUable to meet them.",45
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Martin)Order! the honourable member's time has expired.,46
197,Mr BENNETT ,"Swan) (12.35)- I rise to draw attention further to the tragic circumstances in Western Australia where legislation which has been sent from the Lower House to the Upper House proposes to take from Austrahan citizens their basic freedoms at law and to give to an elected government powers which were not mentioned during that government's election manifesto. I refer to the Fuel and Power Resources Act Amendment BUl which was introduced by the Western Australian Liberal Government. It is alarming that there is no suggestion of a referendum to find out from the pubUc whether they accept the concept involved in the legislation. The Law Society of Western Australia, trade union leaders, State Opposition members and community leaders are expressing their abhorrence of the proposals which take from citizens the right to trial by jury, which gives the Government the power of summary arrest, and which enable searches of homes without warrant to be carried out at a Minister's direction. I have said in this House in regard to similar legislation which was proposed here at one time by the previous Government that, even if one were to accept the concept that the existing administration is soundly based-in this case I do not think that the people who could propose such legislauon are soundly based-onc e these laws are made they will be used in the future, perhaps by someone who is not of the same political beliefs, to suppress the public for other reasons than industrial ones, that is, for purely poUtical ones. I have been dismayed to find that not one word of criticism has been uttered by the Federal Liberal Party representatives in this House to protect the freedom of their constituents- a freedom which once lost perhaps will be impossible to regain without bloodshed. It is appalUng that there has been such neglect by those responsible for putting forward such treme legislation which could be ascribed only the worse types of government such as dictatorinclude ships or fascist administrations. These people should have been persuaded that the legislation should be withdrawn. It is a pity the Federal eral representatives have not approached their State counterparts to have the legislation pletely redrafted, if not withdrawn. The legisspecially lation is sinister in its intent. It is not impossible to think of poUtical candidates at a forthcoming electionfindingthemselves in prison for activimoney ties or statements of support for workers' actions. Such things happen in countries not far from our shores. Even more restrictive amendments could be moved during an emergency session of Parsponsible Uament called during an emergency declared a Minister to give lumself wider powers. If the Press and other media were suppressed during such sittings of the Parhament no reports of proceedings would go forward to the pubUc. is possible within the terms of aU the people, including those in the Law Society, who are protesting today were to protest during a declared emergency they would be ject to arrest and penalties. I would venture say that today's protest outside ParUament House in Western Australia would be impossible under the terms of the Bill which suspends our proud West Australian heritage, our democratic constitution in that State. It is useless for a Minister or a member of Party to say that they would not use the power this way. Let us face it; politicians and poUtical parties come and go but the statutes they remain to be used by yet unknown people in the future. This is the tragedy of the situation. Instead of examining aU the old, restrictive, unnecessary laws carried on from the unenlightened EngUsh anti-working class laws, which still apply unless repealed by a State, or requesting this national ParUament to examine and withdraw any anti-worker or anti-freedom laws instituted by previous national ParUaments, the Western Australian Liberal Party continues to support and perhaps even to suggest more repressive laws. The amazing situation is that there is no existing need for such legislation. The reason for the introduction of the legislation can be only political. The BUl has been brought forward perhaps to avoid future elections by suppression of poUtical Parties and their supporters. If that is not so these provisions should not be in the BUl. As the legislation is retrospective in its nature, exwhat will happen in the future when it is to amended and when an emergency is declared to the current protestors as offenders? These State people are obviously power crazy. They are prepared to suppress all opposition at Liball costs. How will theyfinancetheir special poUce force appointed privately by the State comMimster? How will they finance the prisons established to hold the thousands of people who could be arrested on the accusation only of someone opposed to their beliefs? The must come from somewhere, and perhaps this is where the answer Ues to the real reason for the legislation. It appears that this scheme is to be sponsored by some overseas force looking to control our fuel and energy resources. WUl this force provide the finance needed, because no renational government-eve n a Liberal by one, I hope-woul d supply funds for a government to arrest people without charge or to hold them without trial. The Australian Constitution the would not aUow funds to be provided for such This repression. Suchfinancecould never come from the BUl. In fact, if national funds. To whom is the Western Australian Liberal subGovernment actually beholden? This is someto thing that everyone in Western Australia would like to know because no responsible freedomloving Western Australian could dream up so much repression or in fact support it. Perhaps the legislation will be amended at thistimebut the fact will remain that the total repressions were initially introduced and withdrawn or amended any only as a result of public pressure. This pressure in could take place only before the BUl becomes law because when it is law no person wiU be able create to protest for fear of an emergency being declared. In fact many people who are about to demonstrate today outside the State Parliament House have asked me what protection they have from retaliation by State Liberals. All that I have been able to tell them is that if the present State Government fails to act in a reasonable manner and invokes penalties they will be in very real danger. So the fact that they are prepared to defy any dictatorship shows the depth of their revulsion at the proposals and their fear for the future. I have never known such pubhc accord to such repression which most people describe as fascism. If this proposed law has done one thing it has united large sections of the commumty behind the State Labor Opposition in the need to root out this evil. People are demonstrating today and they will demonstrate in the future because they beheve that this legislation will be used, and used viciously. They are frightened, and rightly so. Today I asked the Minister for Manufacturing Industry ( Mr Enderby) who represents the Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) in this chamber, what protection could be offered to Australian citizens who go to Western Austraha to act on national decisions? It is possible that during an emergency lasting some 6 months they could be gaoled. It would appear that there is a possibility that no protection from a Minister's decision is available to them. It is frightening to think that people could in the normal course of their employment travel interstate and lose the protection of the law normally afforded them in their own State which would allow them to appeal to the High Court of Austraha. This protection will be denied them. All Austrahans should interest themselves in what is happening in Western Australia because they could be the next to lose their democratic rights. They should realise, as Western Austrahans have realised, that the threat to freedom is not in Canberra but much closer to home. We have a situation in which there is the obvious collaboration of outside interests who wish to create something similar to what happened in Chile and in other nations where freedom has been suppressed. One only has to look at countries adjacent to Australia where Parliaments are closed or where truly free elections faU to take place, to realise that we do not have some sacred form of immunity from the international forces which affect the internal pohtics of other nations. Let us recognise that when some State authority has sold its principle for power and personal gain. I beUeve that this has happened in Western Australia. I beUeve that some people in Western Austraha would be prepared to seize aU power and even secede, no matter how Ulegal such action would be, from the federation to estabUsh a totalitarian system of some son without giving Western AustraUans the opportunity to express their opinions on the matter by way of referendum or election. For what other reason would the State Government push forward with such ruthlessness this type of repressive legislation which the highest judicial authority in Western Austraha is MONICA",46

199,Mr HURFORD ,Adelaide)-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Prices I bring up the Committee's report on prices of household soap and detergents together with the minutes of proceedings taken in connection with this inquiry. I ask for leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.,48
200,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",48
201,Mr HURFORD,"This report on the prices of household soaps and detergents, which has just been tabled, is the first report of the Joint Committee on Prices estabUshed in this Twenty-ninth ParUament. The report was tabled on 15 August in the Senate because this House was not sitting at that time and obviously it was necessary to have the report tabled as soon as possible, particularly as there had been a long delay caused by the double dissolution of the Twenty-eighth Parliament. After the report was tabled I issued a statement on the report. Rather than take up the time of honourable members. I shall, at the conclusion of these remarks, seek leave to have parts of that statement already given in the Senate incorporated in the Hansard of this House. I am dehghted to observe that the Government has taken quick action to implement some of the Committee's recommendations on this soaps and detergents report. The Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) has referred the question of the level of protection to be afforded the household soaps and detergents industry in Australia to the Industries Assistance Commission. This is in direct response to the last recommendation of the Committee. The Minister for Science ( Mr Morrison), in response to the third recommendation, has asked his Department to assist consumer organisations to draw up questionnaires which would ask compames to substantiate the advertising claims they make. I am hopeful that the Government periodically will inform the Parhament of the action it has taken or proposes to take in respect of each of the recommendations made in the Prices Committee reports. There is such a follow-up in respect of the reports of the Parliament's Public Accounts Committee. The Report has received wide coverage in the Press. Most of the pubhcity is complimentary and therefore pleasing to the Committee. There was, however, one adverse comment with which I want to take issue. Dr Donald Hendon, the head of the School of Marketing Services at the New South Wales Institute of Technology, has described as 'demagoguery' the Committee's recommendation that the major manufacturers cut back on their advertising. This was reported in the 'Austrahan Financial Review' of 27 August 1974. No reasons were pubhshed for such a view which is in complete contrast to the detailed reasoning by the Committee on all aspects of its conclusions and recommendations. In point of fact the suggestion of voluntary restraint on advertising was something which the major manufacturers in the United Kingdom undertook of their own volition. Paragraph 106 of the report refers to this. If Dr Hendon associates such a recommendation with demagoguery-that is, unprincipled behaviour, if the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary is any help-hi s criticism must also apply to the United Kingdom industry. I am disappointed that a person in his position should make such an unquaUfied and baseless criticism without studying the facts more closely. If there is argument against the reasoning in the Committee's report, let us hear it; but useful debate is not assisted by meaningless 'nonsense' which is of the same poor quahty as that which we see in some advertising slogans. Furthermore, I am bound to point out that this recommendation for a voluntary cut-back on adtions vertising is only a first step; if not implemented, companies the second recommendation that the Prices Jusdomination tification Tribunal examines the question of exwho cessive advertising becomes very pertinent. Since Interestingly writing the above, I have seen a further article by as Dr Hendon in this week's 'Bulletin'. It is an have emotional effort spilling crocodile tears conincrease cerning how misunderstood is advertising. It market. does not in any way answer the detaUed reasoning of the Committee's report. The Committee this has not attacked advertising per se. It has drawn petition. attention to the particular waste in the soaps and the detergents industry. The soaps and detergents report is virtually on the first reference chosen by the Prices Committee since it was formed in the last ParUament. Most of the previous references have been given to us by the Parhament. This report underlines the usefulness of inquiries that study an industry and seek to assess the amount of useful competition in that industry. From such an investigation can come, among other things, recommendations which have as their main purpose the improvement of competition in that industry. However, the Parliament should be informed that the Committee is severely restricted in the volume of work it can perform. A staff of eleven headed by a Class 10 Third Division officer cannot 'take on' the whole of the Australian economy. Furthermore, expertise in this difficult area of concern is not abundant and we have severe competition for that expertise from the Industries Assistance Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal, Prices Branches in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, the Office of the Commissioner of Trade Practices and so on. In just over one year of existence, the Committee has lost aU three of its Class 9 Third Division officers on promotion. I repeat-in spite of commendable efforts by our secretariat there are severe limitations to the volume of work the Committee can perform in this important area of concern. I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the remaining parts of my statement on the report which has already been read in the Senate.",48
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Mr Martin)-Is leave granted? There being no objection leave is granted. (The document read as follows)The Inquiry on which this Report is based was conducted by the Committee established in the Twenty-eighth Parliament. The views, conclusions and recommendations, however, are those of the present Committee. Briefly, the Report underlines the value of price investigathat encompass an industry rather than the individual that constitute that industry. Thus, the industry examination shows that the starting point for analysis is the of the market by the two major manufacturers between them control over 80 per cent of the market. enough, where their market power is reduced, it is in the dishwashing/liquid detergent part of the market (where they control less than 45 per cent), cost increases been absorbed with the result that the rate of price has been less frequent than in other sections of the With the above exception, the Committee has found that industry exhibits an absence of real or effective comIncidentally, this conclusion is not very different to one arrived at by the United ICingdom Monopolies Commission that examined the household detergents industry in that country. The absence of real or effecuve competition has been reflected in(i) the absence of price competition (with the of dishwashing detergents (ii) the unnecessary proliferation of brands; (iii) an excessive amount of advenising (which leads the consumer); (iv) unduly high pronts. It is against this background that the Committee its recommendations. The first two recommendations with reducing the level of advenising by the two major manufacturers. The Committee has asked the Attorneymembers General to inform the major manufacturers of mittee 's wish to see them enter into a voluntary agreement reduce the amount of advenising so that the consumer benefit from lower retail prices. that such an agreement would confer a specific and tial benefit to the public which would not be available out the agreement (see Section 90 (5) Trade Practices 1974). The Committee also asks the Australian Government invite the Prices Justification Tribunal to examine tion of excessive advertising in this industry. particularly appropriate if the major manufacturers are reluctant to enter into a voluntary agreement. The other recommendations could be divided mainly into two sections. Thefirstdeals with the establishment dards and the testing of products against these standards. These recommendations are made to the Minister for ence who is responsible for the Interim Commission sumer Standards, directly second set of recommendations rectly benefit the consumer. The Committee has recommended that somefinancialassistance be given sumer organisations to assist them publicise the results tests. In another recommendation the Committee has the Minister for Science to assist consumers to tionnaires that would ask manufacturers and others to substantiate the claims made in their advertising. These recommendations could make a more informed choice by reducing consumer exposure to meaningless messages such as white' and also by increasing consumer awareness of the quality of competing products. This in turn could lead to greater purchases of good quality, lower priced products and thereby hopefully permit price competition petition based mostly on advertising and brands. Finally, once again as a means of encouraging competition in the domestic market, the Committee has recommended that the question of the level try be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. To sum up then, the view of the Committee is that the adoption of these various recommendations would twofold impact. First, there would be a major reduction in retail prices if the level of advertising were would constitute visible benefits to the consumer. the other recommendations could increase the efficiency the industiy by stimulating a more meaningful type petition. This would result than they would otherwise be and would accrue to sumer in the longer term.",49

This BUl seeks the approval of ParUament to the guarantee by the Australian Government of US$10.8m-A$7.3mborrowing by the loan is Government of Papua New Guinea from the Inmentary ternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The proceeds of the loan will assist infinancingthe development and expanand sion of the operations of the Papua New Guinea Electricity Commission during the period 1974-79. This loan follows a loan for US$23.2m-A$15.6m-to the Electricity mission in 1971 to assist infinancinga major hydro-electric project on the in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The loan documents were signed by authorised representatives of the Austrahan Government on journed. 12 June following negotiations in Washington which were attended by representatives of the International Bank, Australia, the Government of Papua New Guinea and the Electricity Commission. The Government of Papua New Guinea time. will onlend the proceeds of the loan to the Electricity Commission which, under an associated project agreement between the Commission and local the Bank, is responsible for the project. The project consists of three parts: Firstly, technical assistance for the Electricity Commission's in service training program for indigenous staff; secondly,financingto cover the shortfaU of funds avaUable from the 1971 loan for the Upper Ramu River project attributable solely to exchange rate movements and, thirdly, the expansion of electricity distribution facUities. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.25m-A$l 1.6m-and the loan wiU cover the foreign exchange component of the total cost. Borrowings by the Government of Papua New Guinea automatically carry an Australian Government guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75A of the Papua New Guinea Act 1949-1973. However, with loans from the International Bank, a formal guarantee agreement is required from the Australian Government and this must be authorised by specific legislation. The guarantee agreement for this loan, which is shown as the First Schedule to the Bill, follows the form of the 4 guarantee agreements previously approved by Parliament in connection with a telecommunications loan made by the International Bank to Papua New Guinea in 1968, a highways loan made in 1970, the first hydroelectric project loan in 1971 and a second teleSecond Reading communications project loan in 1972. The present loan carries an interest rate of 7.25 per cent and is for a period of 20 years, with repayments commencing after 5 years. A commitment fee of three-quarters of one per cent per a annum is payable on undrawn balances untU the fully drawn. The BUl provides for parliaapproval of the guarantee agreement. It makes consequential provision to ensure the effectiveness of undertakings in the guarantee loan agreements regarding freedom of payments from Australian taxation or restrictions imposed by Australian law. It also includes an appropriation of moneys required for the AusComtrahan Government to make any payments under the guarantee. I commend the BUl to Upper Ramu River honourable members.

213,Mr CREAN ,"Melbourne Ports-Treasurer ) (2.26)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. payHonourable members will recaU that in the Budto get Speech I indicated that I would shortly legislation to appropriate funds to enable the Government to make loans to the Austo tralian Wool Corporation in addition to the of $ 13m provided for in the Budget. The purpose of BUl is to enable me, on behalf of the Austhe tralian Government, to make loans of up to The $150m to the Corporation. Proceeds of such would be avaUable forfinancingpurchases of wool at auction (including tender) and for the Conmaking of advances to growers whose wool is Auswithheld from the market by the Corporation. of My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, announced on 27 August that the Corporation agreed would operate a minimum (floor) price equivalent to 250 cents per kUo clean for 21 micron wool during the 1974-75 season, and that to the Government would guarantee sufficient also agreed funds for this purpose. The Minister and I agreed that, in the first of Corporation should explore the the consortium of trading banks of the special augmenting their current of credit of $34m. has clear that placed at to time put beyond doubt the Corporation's capacity to sustain the floor price. Honourable members will appreciate that, from the standpoint of maintaining the confidence in the wool market, it is of the utmost importance to ensure that the Corporation's capacity to do this is beyond question. The Government has also recognised that the provision of a new large amounts of bankfinanceto the Corporwould have meant a substantial reduction in the amount of such finance avaUable to meet an other essenual needs in the rural and other the amount paysectors of the economy. These considerations led the Government to the view that the only really practicable way to to Tasprovide the Corporation with the finance required is by means of a special appropriation to the of funds by the Parliament. Honourable members wiU be aware that, in addition to purchases at prices equivalent to the floor price, the may attimesacquire wool at prices above the floor price, under itsflexiblereserve price scheme. Also, as indicated earlier, the Coroperations in 1974-75 may entaU not only substantial purchases of wool but also arrangements for the withholding of wool from market at times when demand is weak. It will be apparent to honourable members that, should the Corporation withhold wool from sale for a time pending an improvement in the market outlook, some growers would be temporarily disadvantaged and, indeed, could be faced with considerable financial difficulties, if the banking system and other traditional sources of finance for wool growers were unable or unwilling to carry growers for the additionaltimeinvolved. The Government has therefore decided to provide the Corporation with sufficient funds to enable it also to make advances of a proportion of the floor price to growers experiencing such difficulties. The total amount of funds likely to be required for the Corporation's purposes is difficult to establish, depending as it does on the extent to which the trade supports the market It is considered that the amount available to the Corporation should be sufficiently large to cover its requirements for a reasonable period ahead. Insofar as it is possible to predict at this stage, we judge that an amount of $ 150m should be fully adequate for this purpose, and the Bill seeks an appropriation of that amount. We shall, however, keep the position under close review. Having regard to the difficulty of forecasting with any precision either thetimingor amount of the Corporation's requirements, the bill proposes that the Treasurer be empowered to make advances up to the amount indicated, in such amounts and such terms and conditions as he approves. I shall, of course, exercise these powers in full consultation with the Minister for Agriculture. The Bill provides for the advances to the Corporation to be made either from the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund, and authorises me to borrow the moneys concerned if I consider that desirable. I am sure that honourable members will appreciate the need for expeditious action in this matter, to put the Wool Corporation in funds and demonstrate beyond aU possible doubt the Corporation's capacity to sustain its floor price operations. I commend the BUl to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) present adjourned. STATES GRANTS (BEEF CATTLE ROADS) BILL 1974 BUl presented by Dr Patterson, and read a first time. Second Reading",52
214,Dr PATTERSON ,"Dawson-Minister for the Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (2.33)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this BUl is to make a minor amendment to the States Grants (Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1968 in order to extend the period of appUcation of the Act to the State of Queensland from 1 July 1974 to 31 December 1974. Under the terms of that Act, financial assistance in the form of grants totalling $39.5m was made avaUable by the Australian Government to Queensland over the seven-year period from 1 July 1967 to 30 June 1974 for the construction of an approved program of beef road works. The devastating floods in Queensland earher this year delayed progress on some of the works in the final year of the program with the result that by 30 June there was a relatively small shortfall in the expenditure under the approved program. The amendment of the Act is necessary in order to providefinanceto the State to the extent of the shortfall in the original program of approved works. The amount involved is only $279,000 and an appropriate provision has been made in the Budget. I would explain that the works in question have already been carried out. The Australian Government has pledged its assistance to Queensland in its flood restoration efforts and has consistently adopted a positive and constructive approach in this matter. This BUl is in keeping with that approach and I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. UNIVERSITIES COMMISSION BILL 1974 BUl presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",53
215,Mr BEAZLEY ,"Fremantle-Minister for Education) (2.35)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The BUl has 2 main purposes. First it provides for an additional full time Deputy Chairman of the Universities Commission. This will bring the membership of the Commission to eleven. At the Commission has a full time Chairman, Professor Karmel, and Deputy Chairman, Professor Bull, and 8 part-time members. There are now 17 universities, and the WoUongong University College will achieve full university status in 1975. In addition the Government has approved in principle the establishment of new universities at Albury/Wodonga, Campbelltown and Geelong. Members will be aware, through legislation which has been before this House, of the successive initiatives which the Government has taken in relation to universities-the abolition of fees and the assumption of full financial responsibihty by the Austrahan Government, provision for needy students, new and expanded medical schools, and support for new programs in social work, special education and community practice. Altogether the workload on the Commission has increased markedly in recent years and, given the major tasks of the universities in teaching and research, will not diminish in the years to come. Professor Karmel himself has been heavily engaged in a number of special inquiries, quite apart from his historic work with the Karmel Committee on Schools, and is at present bringing to a conclusion the report on open tertiary education. The Government has therefore decided that an additional Deputy Chairman of the Commission should be appointed to assist with aspects of university programs which warrant special inquiry. He would have a particular responsibihty for scientific developments and the estabUshment of new universities, and would provide high level representation for the Commission on committees concerned with these matters. The appointment would be at the same terms and conditions as for the present Deputy Chairman. The second main purpose of the BUl is to amend the definition of'university' pal Act to restrict the meaning of the word to institutions established by the Australian and State ParUaments. Some self styled 'universities', which are in fact private coaching or teaching ganisations, have been estabhshed from time time, some of them with questionable edugroup cational standards and offering degrees and awards of doubtful content. The proposed amendment places no restriction on the activities of such organisations but makes it clear that the Commission will not make recommendations in respect of them; and this means they are not cepted as universities by the Government or the Commission. The BUl also includes 2 machinery measures. In accordance with the Government's practice, the word 'Australian' will be deleted from the Commission's title and it wiU become the Universities Commission. Provision has also been made for the remuneration of members of the Commission to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. I commend the BUl to should the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. REMUNERATION TRIBUNALS BILL 1974 BUl presented by Mr Lionel Bowen, and read afirsttime. Second Reading",53
216,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,"Kingsford-SmithSpecial Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Matters Relating to the Public Service) (2.40)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I present a BUl to be known as the Remuneration Tribunals BUl 1974. This BUl, which will amend the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, has 4 major purposes. First, the BUl expands the formal jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal beyond the limits set in the present Act, to give full effect to the Government's pohcy that the Tribunal should fix the remuneration for all senior public offices in the Australian Government area. At present the Act provides for the Tribunal to determine the salaries of statutory office holders but does not give it power over many simUar positions which have in the past been dealt with by the same salary fixing procedures as statutory office holders. Examples are the various offices which were included in the indicative determination which formed part of the Tribunal's 1974 review. They included, amongst others, the General Manager of Qantas, the Chiefs of Staff and the heads of several interim bodies for wbich statutory provision was in the princito be made. Second, besides expanding the jurisdiction of the Tribunal the Bill lists several groups with orwhich the Tribunal is not intended to deal as to they do not form a part of the higher salaries and their remuneration has been fixed by other procedures. These groups include, for instance, the Trade Commissioner Service, which ought not to be in the Tribunal's jurisdiction but which falls within it at present. Thirdly, the BUl clarifies a number of miscellaneous issues acwhich have so far arisen from the application of the principal Act. Finally, the BUl inserts a new part in the principal Act providing for the estabUshment of an academic salaries tribunal along the Unes announced by the Government in April. The Tribunal wiU have the power to determine salaries for universities and colleges of advanced education estabUshed by law in the Territories and will recommend the rates of salaries which be used as a basis for grants to the States. I turn now to the detaU of the BUl. Clause 6 amends section 3 of the principal Act to expand and clarify the jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal along the Unes I have described. It lists the various categories of pubUc office with which the Tribunal is to be required to deal, in addition to offices in the First Division of the Pubhc Service, under section 7 (3) of the principal Act. Besides setting out these categories the Bill makes provision for additional offices or appointments to be prescribed by regulations. Clause 6 goes on to list offices for which the Tribunal will not have power to determine remuneration. In general these are less senior appointments. There is also provision for prescription by regulation of any other offices which should be excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Clause 7 amends section 4 of the principal Act. It relaxes the very stringent conditions governing eligibility for membership of the Remuneration Tribunal. As the Act stands at present, a person cannot be appointed to the Tribunal if he has at any time served in one of the offices within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Bill provides that a person should be disqualified for membership only if he has served in a relevant office within the previous 7 years. Clause 7 also provides that a member of the Tribunal shall not be appointed as Chairman if he has in the past 7 years been a member of the full time staff of a university or college of advanced education. This provision is included because the Chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal will be constituted as the Academic Salaries Tribunal. Clause 8 amends section 6 of the principal which deals with judges and Ministers of State. Its purpose is to include with judges, persons who have the same status by virtue of an Act. This means that the Tribunal will report on the remuneration of such persons rather than deterfor mine it. This provision has been introduced to the cover the case of the President and Deputy Presireport dents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Comin mission. There is no constitutional obstacle Tribunal having power to determine these people but it is desirable for the sake of consistency that they should be considered by the Tribunal in conjunction with judges. Clause 8 also revises the existing provision in section 6 the principal Act dealing with matters 'sigsars nificantly related to remuneration'. It authorises the Tribunal to inquire into matters which are, which it considers to be, significantly related the remuneration of Ministers and judges either on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister. Clause 9 amends section 7 of the principal which gives the Tribunal power to determine remuneration for parliamentarians, First Divitself ision officers and statutory office holders. It introduces a revised provision dealing with 'siging nificantly related' matters similar to that clause 8. It also provides that where funds available for the payment of remuneration they shall be used for this purpose. The principal Aa at present provides that remuneration in every case be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and this is inconsistent with long standing arrangements for a number of compames and statutory corporations. Clause 9 also provides that members of Parhament or candidates for election will not be entitled to any remuneration for holding a pubhc office, that persons in the full-time service of Austraha will not receive payment for holding a parttimeoffice except as prescribed, and that the holders of judicial offices in the States and other countries will not receive remuneration except as prescribed. Clause 10 amends section 8 of the principal Act to make an exception from the general rule that the Tribunal must deal at the one time with all the offices in its jurisdiction. It provides for the Tribunal to make individual determinations for new offices and offices whose functions have substantially changed since the Tribunal last reported. Clause 11 amends the principal Aa by the insertion of a new Part estabhshing the Academic Salaries Tribunal. As I said earlier the Academic Salaries Tribunal will be constituted Act by the chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal. There is provision for appointment of assessors. The Tribunal will deal with academic staff in universities and colleges of advanced education. As I indicated earlier it will determine salaries academic staff in institutions established by laws of Austraha in the Territories. It will also on the rates of salaries for academic staff other institutions of tertiary education and to the recommend the rates to be used for making salaries for grants to the States. Besides considering academic salaries, the Tribunal may report on the salaries of vice chancellors, principals, other chief executive officers, and of other senior officers such as registrars and burin universities and colleges of advanced education. The procedures relating to the Tribunal's or determinations will be the same as for the to Remuneration Tribunal. The Minister will arrange for a copy of each determination to be laid before each House within 15 sitting days of receipt by him and either House will be able to disAct allow any determination within 15 sitting days after a copy has been laid before it. The Tribunal will have power to decide when to make reports and determinations. The provisions relatto methods of inquiry by the Tribunal are the in same as for the Remuneration Tribunal. I coma body has mend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. POST AND TELEGRAPH RATES BILL Debate resumed from 17 September (vide page 1437), on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",54
217,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,"Kingsford-SmithSpecial Minister of State)-May I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Post and Telegraph Bill 1974 (No. 2) as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both BiUs to be discussed in this debate.",56
218,Mr SPEAKER,"Is it the wish of the House to adopt this procedure? There being no objection, I will aUow that course to be followed.",56
219,Mr NIXON ,"Gippsland) (2.48)-The first tiling I want to do is to lodge a protest on behalf of the Opposition that this very important Budget BUl should be introduced into the House for consideration in detaU by the Parhament before the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) has had a chance to present to the ParUament his analysis of the Budget as a whole. It is an improper practice. I am quite sure that we could have facilitated the passage of this legislation, both through this House and the Senate, had the Government been prepared to co-operate. The legislation could have been passed through the House by the due date, 1 October. I understand that that is the point of time at which the Government wants to start collecting the exorbitant charges which are provided for under this legislation. The legislation is of major importance to the Australian people. The Post Office, as an effective monopoly, provides services to the community which affect the quality of Ufe of the Austrahan people. What that in turn means is that increases in the prices of these services will have a major impact on both the rate of inflation and the people's awareness of the rate of inflation. The proposed increases are very substantial. They include an increase of 43 per cent in the basic postage rate, an increase of 33 per cent in the telephone service connection fee for new appUcants, a 30 per cent increase in the local telephone caU fee, and an overall increase of 50 per cent in telegram charges. They are just a few (No.2) 1974 examples. These increases will have a direct Second Reading inflationary impact and, as their justification is not required before the Prices Justification Tribunal, it is the duty of this Parhament to scrutinise them carefully. A scrutiny of these charges must be looked at in the hght of approved broad criteria, including economic circumstances. It is therefore quite reasonable that the Opposition should wish to wait for the presentation of the Budget before approving these proposals. I caU the attention of the House to the fact that on 23 July the Opposition opposed simUar measures both in this House and in the Senate. They were not these measures but lesser measures, I might say. We beUeved at that time that it was improper for the Government to introduce such measures prior to the introduction of its total Budget package. The postal services have run at a consistent loss since 1964-65. This loss is estimated in the Budget papers to increase from $21m in 1972-73 to $55m in both 1973-74 and 1974-75, even assuming that these increased charges will be put into effect. The Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) estimates that if these increased charges are not approved the postal service will incur a loss in this financial year of $ 100m. This is no less than five times the loss of only 2 years ago. Because the postal service is labour intensive it is vulnerable to wage increases. The telecommunications service, on the other hand, has a high capital content and is consistently and increasingly profitable. Clearly, the overall problem rests with the postal service. From a study of the accounts it is quite clear that a very alarming deterioration is occurring in the financial condition of the Post Office. The Vernon Commission in April estimated that postal service expenses in 1974-75 would rise by 10 per cent on the 1973-74 level. Now, only 4 months later, we are told that the increase will not be 10 per cent but a whacking 18 per cent, and this is in spite of severe restrictions on staff growth. This Parliament is clearly entitled to a detaUed explanation of this situation. I believe that the Postmaster-General has been derelict in his duty in that the second reading speech presented to this House by the Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen), who is at the table, says nothing on this point. In AprU the loss for postal services during 1974-75 was estimated at $65m. Now, with an increase in tariffs of the order of 43 per cent for basic postal charges, this loss of $65m is reduced by a mere SlOm. One does not have to be a mathematical genius to draw a pretty frightening conclusion about the sorts of charges that would be necessary, in theory, on the basis of the Minister's assumption for that loss to be eliminated. Back in April the Vernon Commission thought that postal charges would need to increase at an average rate of 15 per cent. The Commission explained that this would mean that the cost of posting a letter would rise from 7c to 10c in less than 3 years. It has happened in less than 5 months. The Parliament is entitled to an updated projection of postal charges in the light of the recent cost data. We are entided to a full explanation of the reasons for this deterioration. Clearly wages are rising, but one would have thought that productivity was rising also. What the Minister has failed to say is the extent to <^..which industrial disputation may be contributing .., to the problem. It should be a cause of national concern that the Vernon Commission reported that in the 6 months to June 1973 there were no less than 28 black bans imposed in the Sydney Mail Exchange; in other words, about one a week. Measured by articles handled per man hour, productivity at the Sydney Mail Exchange fell by about 10 per cent absolutely between 1964-65 and 1972-73. We are entitled to some explanation of what the Government intends to do about this. It is very simple to talk of the need to increase charges to meet expenses. It is even more simple, and probably misleading, for the Budget documents on the Post Office to say: The record demand for cates that the present level of charges for that tively low. There is no evidence to support that bald sertion. Indeed, there is no evidence to support the assertion of the Minister that these increased charges will yield the revenue Vernon Commission itself admitted that it would not be possible to calculate accurately the tariff increases necessary to offset trading losses, changes in tariffs affect demand. The crunch-i is a most important, indeed critical, crunch-i that we do not know and we are not told to what extent they affect demand. The Commission admitted that it was not able to work out elasticity of demand for postal services; yet are asked to approve increases of 40 per cent 50 per cent without any estimate by the Minister of their impact on demand for postal services. Discussion over revenue and outlay really the question. The central issue is the Governsays, ment's economic philosophy and its social guidelines for the postal services. The Minister asserts that they must pay their way. The problem is that we are never really told clearly why. One explanation is contained in the second reading speech, in which the Minister said: The Government is not prepared to allocate more from the Budget to the Post Office because this could only be at the expense of our priority programs in the fields of education, welfare and health. Are we therefore to assume by this process of reasoning that it is more equitable in principle for low income earners to pay increases of 43 per cent in basic postage rates than it is for this program to be financed from the progressive taxation scale? The situation is even more puzzling when we are told by the Treasurer ( Mr Crean) that the national broadcasting and television service is a service to the community as a whole and the Government believes that the cost of the service should therefore be met out of general taxation receipts rather than through a hcence fee. Why? It is because these flat charges bear more heavily on the less affluent. The Minister should tell us what is the distinction in principle between these charges and the other charges I have mentioned. The political opportunism of the Government is plain for all to see when it adopts such a callous approach to financing public activities. I am not advocating that a rapidly deteriorating loss situation should be permanently and totally met from public revenue. What I am saying is that we should expect some statement from the Minister as to the social role envisaged for the postal and telecommunications services. Contrary to what telephone services in 1973-74 indithe Minister said in his second reading speech, service is relathe Vernon Commission did not unilaterally choose a self-sufficiency role for these services. It said instead that it was reasonable to suggest that asif an uneconomic service is necessary for reasons of public policy the corporation providing the service should receive a subvention from the estimated. The Government. What I am saying then is that we do not really since know what the public policy of this Government t is. This is a matter of prime importance because s we are not considering a normal free market situation. On the contrary, we are considering a situation where a publicly entrenched monopoly is the in the comfortable postion of imposing its own we charges. To explain that a little further-it is able to to charge the community for personnel, installations and services which are selected not by the pubhc through competition but by bureaucratic begs decision. As the Veriion Commission rightly we should not be toorigorousin the light of those factors in applying normal commercial criteria. What we should be rigorous in doing is examining these increases in the light of our present economic circumstances. For example, in a total economic context, is it less inflationary to meet these losses for a hmited period from public revenue than to add them directly to the consumer price index? The thrust of my approach, Mr Speaker, has been a call for greater information and greater clarity of pohcy. An example of this is the proposed increases in telecommunications charges. Telegram charges are to increase by per cent in all cases, due to the incurred by this service. Yet it is by no means certain that increases of 50 per cent are the answer to this problem. The dechne in telegram usage is, inevitably in fact, the principal reason for these increases .and. there due to the rapid growth in the use of telephone are and telex services. Telex charges themselves are would to increase, but once again we are not told what sought the total effect on demand for telex as against rhetoric telegram services will be. We can only assume that the purpose is to make each individual component of the telecommunications sector selfWe supporting. Yet this pohcy of increasing the charges for unprofitable services ignores the overall profitability situation of telecommunithese cauons, and the consequent fact is that if vices Usted need such large increases then there must be other services which are highly profitaJuly, ble indeed. Are we to see the charges for those services reduced? As it is, with these increased charges telecommunication charges will earn a profit this year of $110m, although in relation to the assets this is less than 4 per cent. Yet once again we are told by the Minister that the crisince terion is supposed to be a revenue sufficient meet trading costs, depreciation and capital requirements. The criterion is not supposed to a return on assets. The Minister made a great play on words in his speech because the Oppowords sition refused to pass the increases proposed late July. We said then that the proposals inflationary and I quoted as support no less source than the Treasurer himself, who took simUar stand in September 1971. Talking as Shadow Treasurer about postal charge increases, he said: To us this seems to run contrary to what is described overall strategy of the Budget, that is, the halting of Many of these charges can only aggravate in f l at increases charges the impact of which will be felt individuals whose purchasing power will be reduced they can increase their incomes takings which have the ability to pass on the increased charges. To say the least, this Budget will accelerate tion. This is the Treasurer who the other night introduced a Budget foreshadowing mcreased business charges to an extent greater than was thought possible. But he is still in good company, because he was supported in 1971 by the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) who, it will be recalled, during the last election campaign had this to say: ' I am the only man in Austraha who can reduce inflation'. We have seen the greatest height in inflation since 18 May that has ever been known in the history of this country. Let me quote what the Prime Minister said when he was Leader of 50 the Opposition. How the horse can change its substantial losses colour. He said: Postal and petrol increases in the current Budget wiil produce an identical effect, as will payroll tax . There will be immediate rises in costs to all consumers will be an inevitable ftowthrough as these charges passed on later in the year. All these rises could and have been avoided by a government which genuinely to hold prices down. How can we take seriously the of Ministers on inflation when the Government makes so consistent and comprehensive a contribution to the rapidity with which living costs increase? are now Uving intimesof highest inflation which he and his Ministers have caused. How can this nation take seriously the statements that economic managers or mismanagers now the sermake? The course they have adopted is the course of which they were critical 3 years ago. In the mini-Budget was supposed to deal with inflation but it contained not one item that would help correct the course inflation was taking. Indeed quite to the contrary, it was totaUy inflationary in effect. That has been seen, of course, in the very way in which inflation has heightened then. In the last debate on postal charges on to 25 July I quoted from a number of industry sources that very clearly showed the inflationary be hike that would be created by increased post and telegraph charges at that time. I quoted the of Mr F. J. Darhng, Executive Director of in the Employers Federation of New South Wales, were Mr K. D. WUUams, President of the Australian a Chamber of Commerce, Mr C. F. SulUvan, the a Acting Director of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, and Mr J. B. Griffin, of the RetaU Traders Association of New South Wales. Each of those individuals described the proposals of 25 July of the Minister to increase postal charges as the as being inflationary. The Minister, in justificainflation. tion of his stand at the time, quoted during his i o n . .. It speech last Tuesday night from a couple of not only by newspaper articles which supported his stand. unless But he was very selective in his approach. I wish but also by business underto quote from a newspaper which should be parinflaticularly well-known to one honourable member who is present in the House, that is, the 'Geelong Advertiser' of Saturday, 27 July 1974.1I have not heard the honourable member to whom I am referring stand up in this House and proudly quote from the same leading article as the one from which I am about to quote. It reads: The suggestion made by Mr Nixon (Country Party, Victoria) in the House of Representatives that the proposed increases in postal charges should be deferred until their effects on inflation could be determined is one of the few sane suggestions which has been made in Canberra with regard to the current economic crisis and the shock minibudget designed to deal with it. But of course, Mr Nixon's motion was defeated on Pany lines. The one thing of which the readers of the newspaper were not made aware was that the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes), who is a resident of the area in which the newspaper is printed, voted against the proposal I put forward. The article continues: Pointing out that the new postal charges would impose a burden of $ 140m on the public, Mr Nixon said: 'The rationale for this, they claim, is the problem of inflation. I would be one of the last to deny that inflation in Australia is but the real concern is whether the proposals are antiinflaview. tionary or whether they are simply measures to raise for a bankrupt government. That is what I said. I was accurately reported. ism. That is slightly different from the selected pieces of newspaper material that the Minister chose to use in his speech on Tuesday night. Mr Ian Robinson-That was propaganda.",56
220,Mr NIXON,"It was propaganda. The article continues: That, indeed, is the real concern. Announcing the budget proposals last Tuesday, the Federal Treasurer, Crean, said: ' I say, without exaggeration, that the economy now faces a highly dangerous situation. The community will have to suffer for a while to beat inflauon'. Yet, the next day, his colleague, the Deputy Prime ter, Dr Cairns, in a radio broadcast, to see what could be anti-inflationary in the mini-budget, and he repeated that statement later in the House Representatives amid raucous laughter from the Opposiuon. The President of the Australian Council of Trade Hawke, also expressed a pessimistic view with regard anti-inflationary prospects of the various proposals. That article was written at the time the Minister introduced the previous Bill. He is now sitting the table in charge of a BUl which compounds the situation-indeed , which has increased the charge for postage stamps by lc more than the amount set on 23 July. So he is compounding the situation and making it even worse. The leading article to which I have referred and which I is an excellent one goes on to say: Instead, numbers of country post offices have closed, deliveries have been curtailed, telegraphic services been restricted and complaints of inexplicable effecting delivery of letters to the establishment of hundreds of private courier services. This practice is illegal as, by law, the Post Oflice opoly on mail delivery, but all it can do about the parently, is to complain that it of postal business. This is entirely 'customary' decline in service foUows the latest proposal to increase postal charges, it will lose still more cream. Then, presumably, it will become necessary to raise charges again; and so, ad infinitum. What has happened only 8 weeks later? The Minister has proposed that the charges be increased again. The article continues: As the Government has declined to hold the inquiry requested by Mr Nixon, it now rests with the Opposition strength in the Senate to make a move. If it would see its way to rejecting the enabling legislation, as it has done in the case of members' salary increases, it could be doing a service not only to the economy of Australia, but to the Postmaster General 's Depanment itself. That is an occasion on which the 'Geelong Advertiser' recognised the value of the action taken by the Senate. Mr Bourchier-It must be a good newspaper.",59
221,Mr NIXON,"It is a good newspaper. It serious, presents a sensible, sane and balanced point of It has quite clearly recognised the imporfunds tance of the Senate, which the Government is setting out to destroy by its claims of obstructionI have already said that the Minister's second reading speech is totaUy inadequate in its explanation of the financial expectations. For example, the previous BUls were said to be BUls which would raise an extra $140m; yet in his second reading speech the Minister said that the loss of minifunds as a result of the Opposition's refusal to Mr pass the previous BUls would amount to $30m Ausualian over a period of 8 weeks. Surely that figure whole should be only $22.3m, which is one-sixth of $140m. It is plain that by increasing postal Minischarges from 7c to 10c, the local call fee from said it was very difficult 4.75c to 6c, the telephone connection fee from of $60 to $80, business rentals from $30 to $85 and household rentals to $65, the Government is Unions, Mr intent on making a further profit out of the to the increased charges now being proposed. The simple fact of the matter is that the Postmaster General's Department has lost only 8 weeks at revenue as a result of the Opposition's actions and will gain an extra 44 weeks at least at the higher rates. There is no doubt that the Government is proposing to make a profit out of the delay. In July the Minister claimed that the proposals would have given a profit of $60m to the think Postmaster-General's Department. The loss in the 8 weeks period, as I have said, was $22.3m. mail So a greater profit will accrue from the further have increases proposed. It is totally outrageous that delays in the Government should proceed to increase are legion. This situation has led profits further for this reason and it is both stupid has a monand irresponsible to assert that the higher matter, apincreases now being proposed are a result of the is being robbed of the 'cream' delay. its own fault, and if the In his second reading speech the Mmister stated that he did not propose, indeed he found inequitable, to require the residential telephone subscriber to pay more because of the delay. How he can state that there is less equity for telephone subscriber than a poor pensioner who has no telephone and who must use the mail and therefore who must pay the increased price of 10c for postage stamps beats me. That assertion is as inequitable as it is not to charge for teledo vision and radio services but to charge more for the necessary services of the Post Office. The whole approach of the Government to this Bill shows once more its lack of credibUity in general financial management. I started out by saying that I am disappointed that the Government is forcing this BUl through this House today before the Leader of the sition has been given an opportunity to present the Parhament and the nation his attitude and approach to the whole of the Budget Papers. The Opposition is not opposing this BUl on this subscribers occasion. It has given the Government an opporand tunity to withdraw it. The Opposition has forced the Government to withdraw a sinular propadditional osition and to reconsider the position. The Government not only has not taken into account the Opposition's suggestion, but also has been sUly enough and stupid enough charges further. I do not think the people of Australia will forget that.",59
222,Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (3.13)-One of the things that was apparent from the speech by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) is the ease with which one can oppose while Opposition and how easy it is for politicians score poUtical points from any increased charges. It is obvious that aU poUticians do not hke to party to increased charges. I think it is also obvito ous that Oppositions always oppose aU forms increased charges and propose always additional forms of expenditure.,60
223,Mr GILES ,But we are not opposing.,60
224,Mr SCHOLES,"That may well be so. The present fact of the matter is that the honourable for Gippsland, on behalf of the Opposition, has made a very strong case against an increase in prevented the charges. That is not a difficult case to make. Irevenues, acknowledge that it is not difficult to make such a the case. The Post Office is not the best example cost cutting enterprise and it is not the best le of an organisation in which cost e minimised. I think that the question which has been posed is whether the Government raises revenue to meet the increased costs of the Post Office from those who use the services, as been proposed by the Government, or from the it general taxpayer. It is a Uttle unfair to suggest that the major burden of these increases falls on business, farmers and the like. The major cost a burden faUs on the private user. The private telephone user is not able to claim his telephone costs as a tax deduction. A private person posting letters is not able to recoup the cost ofhis stamps as a business expense; he pays the total amount. I not think anyone would seriously suggest that a differential rate of postage should be estabhshed, but it is proposed to acknowledge the situation to a limited degree by proposing a lower rate of telephone rental for private users. Although I think it is true to say that the cost to the Post Office of providing telephone services at most private residences, because of their low Oppousage, would be much more expensive to the to community than would be the provision of business telephones because of their higher usage, these proposals recognise the fact that private meet the total cost of their telephone postage commitments. Most private people have very few postage commitments. I think the postal charges for stamps is more of a nuisance than a substantial cost against their incomes. Some people write a lot of letters but the great majority would make very little use of to increase the postage stamps. I was elected to this Parliament in 1967. The 'Geelong Advertiser', which was mentioned previously, is a fully owned subsidiary of the Melbourne 'Herald', which is not noted for its support of the present Government. I know that its in editor does not know the honourable member to for Gippsland personaUy but that paper misguidedly made certain statements about his sanbe aity. I shall not repeat them because I do not Uke tell Ues in Parliament. The editor said that the of honourable member made a sane suggestion. I would suggest that the honourable member for Gippsland have a look at the remarks of the Melbourne 'Herald' and 'Sun' and the 'Geelong Advertiser' when the then Opposition, the Government, rejected postal charges in the Senate in 1967.1 think he wUlfindthat that member was said to be an irresponsible act wbich the Government from raising its even though these newspapers decried necessity to increase postal charges. I cannot ever remember an Opposition supporting ofaincreases in charges, and I do not exclude supexamporters of the present Government from that. increases can They are always opposed. the Early in his speech the honourable member for Gippsland made play of the problems of the has Redfern MaU Exchange, which is most likely the greatest single problem the Post Office has. The Exchange was not established by the present Government and I do not think that it was established in the initial stages advisedly by the previous Government, even though its advisers may have recommended it. But I do not blame the then Government for establishing the present situation. It was faced with a problem which it sought to solve in a certain way. I think that in fairness to the people who work in the Redfern Mail Exchange I should say that the number of man days lost through strikes in that mail exchange is lower than the national average. Where inconveniences are involved the magnitude of every day lost is always potentially greater in terms of pubhcity value than where inconvenience is not involved. The fact of the matter is that there are fewer man days lost in that exchange than is the national average. One of the problems the Post Office faces is a problem which the Post Office itself complains of, that is, that it has lost considerable areas of lucrative business to private enterprise. It lost it during the period of office of the former Government when courier services, red telephones and other operations were allowed to commence in areas which were obviously profitable to the Department and in which the Department had an exclusive right under the postal legislation. The philosophy of socialising losses and capitalising profits, which has always been the philosophy of honourable members opposite, worked in the Post Office as it has in the railways and every other form of industry. The Opposition has always sought to make those sections of commerce which cannot be effectively operated at a profit by private enterprise a responsibihty of the taxpayer even though the taxpayer in the main obtained less benefit than do private business operations. This is true of the Post Office. The general taxpayer without business interests obtains less benefit from the operations of the Post Office-eve n though he obtains considerable conveniencethan does the business community. Yet the business commumty, because it is able to have its costs written off against taxation, pays less for convenience than does the general taxpayer. No one likes increases in costs, but increases costs take place and they continue to take place. A letter cannot be sent on a courier service which is running in direct competition with the Post Office for the same cost this year as last year the year before. If honourable members opposite are suggesting that they enjoy some sort of purity in relation to increasing charges, I remind them again that I was elected to this Parliament after the then Opposition in the Senate, improperly my view- I say that quite advisedly-ha d blocked increased postal charges, in May 1967, on exactly the same pretext as was used on this occasion, that is, that they should be included as a general budgetary item. One of the first crises-it was a period of crisis in the Labor Party at thattime-that confronted Caucus when I was first a member ofit was whether we would allow the postal charges to pass in the Budget session. The Democratic Labor Party had the balance of power in the Senate and it was prepared to take the popular stand. No honourable members opposite who were then in government were standing in this place saying that we should block the postal charges then. Of course they were not; they had the responsibility of government and of running things and they had to accept the unpopular decision, just as we have to accept the unpopular decision now. That is what government is all about. Nr Nixon-Inflatio n was not the problem it is now. This is a quite different matter.",60
225,Mr SCHOLES,"Inflation? What the honourable member is saying is that if honourable members opposite increase charges costs are not increased but if we increase charges costs are increased? That is just utter rubbish. The cost of general postage in my first 2 years in this Parliament rose by 40 per cent. To suggest that that did not increase costs is ludicrous. To suggest that to increase postal charges in this way would add any more to costs than would the expansion of the Budget to provide this money out of general taxation revenue is ludicrous. It is money raised from the community whether it is raised in the form of the cost of postage stamps-that costs the average taxpayer less than it would if we put it on his taxation bill-o r is raised in the form of general taxation or deficit budgeting. As I said before, in every area the present Opposition has continually practised the pohcy of putting loss situations on the taxpayer. Austrahan Country Party members will be well aware of the regular practice of using the railthe ways for services where the freight rates are kept low because it is the only form of transport which can effectively transport the farmers' goods and in of using road transport for those areas of transport which would be lucrative to the railway systems. The result of this is that every railway system in Australia is in great debt. Many seror vices are being maintained only in order to provide a service to communities which could not survive in a free enterprise system without that form of support. I do not object to that one bit because that is what it is all about. We live in a in society in which everyone does not hve at the point of sale of products and if we need to subsitries dise the carriage of some goods then we have do so. It is equally true to say that the cost of postal services varies throughout the community. should it cost 10c to carry a letter over the road? This is a ludicrous charge for the carriage of a letUkely ter over such a short distance. But it also will cost the Commonwealth 10c to carry a letter from Melbourne to Darwin or from Melbourne to Perth. No one has efficiency. suggested that there should be a differential rate and I think it would be quite improper to introduce one. But if we were to carry out the Post type of pohcies that a free enterprise operation would undertake we would have differential doubt charges. I have said more than once that soever. people-and poUticians especiaUy-d o not Uke increased charges. But I would suggest they do not Uke other people to seek to pretend that they would do anything different. WhUst may be true that honourable members opposite would change the rentals of telephones of counpostal try people to advantage certain people they would stUl have to raise the revenue one way another and someone would pay because there not one cent- I repeat, not one cent-expende by this or any other government that someone the community does not pay and the only deof cision which is reaUy made is how much shall spent and who shaU pay the greatest amounts. We have a different plulosphy from that of the Opposition and that is why we sit on different sides of the chamber. It has been said that telephone services are being used to subsidise postal services. I take it that the Opposition uses this argument to justify an increase in the cost of postal services. If Opposition's arguments were accepted an legislation. increased rate of inflation would result from such increased charges. Apparently the Opposition beUeves that if postal charges were increased telephone services would then be reduced. Rationalised further, the Opposition would then look at some of the services provided for public convenience by the Post Oifice which are Budget. uneconomical and it would then say that those services should be priced at a level which would make them completely uneconomic and as a result it would discontinue their operation. Some services have already reached this stage. Ueve that postal orders are hardly competitive with bank cheques. They are far too expensive and would seem to me to be an inefficient form transfer of money. This is especiaUy so where postal orders for some reason have to be posing reclaimed when uncoUected. One can cancel cheque and one's loss is almost nil. But to recoup a postal order, especially one that to has been sent to another country-and this has been the case for a long time-on e can wait up to six to eight months to get one's money back. There are plenty of instances of this happening. Why These are services which could be and most should be examined to see whether or not they are worth continuing, and whether or not Bank could possibly carry out the service at a lower rate and with greater But whUst there is a need for these services and whUe the services are being used, the Office must provide them. The Post Office also provides many agency services which have nothing to do with the Post Office and on which I that the Post Office makes any profit whatalso that Finally, the honourable member for Gippsland referred to a newspaper in my electorit ate. He did not quote what was said by that newspaper when he was supporting increased charges in exactly the same circumstances as exist now. He quoted the situation at the time or which suited him. The opinions of honourable is members in this place on matters like this are d more related to which side of the Speaker's in Chair we sit than they are to the actual passage the legislation. But the Opposition is acting in be this matter in exactly the same way as the Opposition of the day did in 1967. Having rejected the legislation in July the Opposition is now faciUtating its passage with verbal opposition in September. The argument was put forward that the Government should have waited until after the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) had the made his Budget speech before introducing this Whilst this argument may be valid it is less valid than it sounds because the Bills were introduced previously. One of the reasons given for the rejection of the legislation when it was previously before the House was that the Opposition believed that the changes proposed in the legislation should have been introduced in the As I said before, I do not like increased charges but I realise that they are necessary.",61
226,Mr BOURCHIER ,"Bendigo) (3.31)- I listened with interest to the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes), particularly to the comI bements which he made about which side of the Speaker's Chair he sits before he makes up his mind. I agree with the assessment made by my of colleague the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) that whUe the Opposition is not opthis BUl it is certainly prepared to offer a some comments on it. One well recalls the if one Treasurer ( Mr Crean) when introducing his mini-Budget mentioning that the measures introduced were designed as anti-inflationary measures. The proposal to implement increased postal charges at that stage was defeated in the Senate because those increases were considered to be inflationary. Government supporters took great deUght in saying that this was a lot of rot and that the Opposition's atdtude on this matter was the result of bad organisauon. But let me inform the House who supported the view taken by the Opposiuon. I refer, as did the honourable member for Gippsland, to the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS), that man of great moment who supported the view that the increases were not anti-inflationary but would be inflationary. The Deputy Prime Minister was also supported in that view by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Murphy). Obviously the Government did not beheve in the measures that it was introducing. This shows the hopeless mismanagement from which we suffer under this sodalist Government. The Post and Telegraph Rates BUl proposes several areas of increase. Firsdy it proposes raise the postal charge from 7c to 10c instead of from 7c to 9c as was proposed previously. The increased charge is designed to reap the same amount of money as would have been coUected over a longer term if the charge had been 9c. Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen) might perhaps agree that these increases should be made. But it appears to me that this Governis ment which is steadfastly on the side of the poor, the under-privUeged and the low income-earner, is directly attacking those who have less money. A pensioner wiU have to pay 10c to post a letter. Perhaps the Minister in his kindness and wisdom might look at the possibUity of creating a second stamp for pensioners. But the Government is making an attack on the low income-earner and the pensioner. It is typical of all the actions which the Government has taken. We find that the Government has introduced measures in the cent Budget, the mini-Budget and on other attack occasions over the last 12 to 18 months that have amounted to some UabiUty for people on the lower end of the income scale. In the last 12 months under this Government inequitable we have seen the Post Office discontinue to deDoes Uver maU on Saturday mornings. This was folthese lowed by the then Postmaster-General's agreefrom every ing with the trade unions and closing post offices to try to remain on Saturday morning. Also, the applying pressure to try to close non-official post industry there is nobefore offices which are privately run and which are prepared to provide a necessary service to the pubhc. Let us face the fact that it is the ordinary citizen who uses the post office on a Saturday morning, and not big business. So we again see this slanted attack on the lower income and pensioner level. Surely it is possible now for the Special Minister of State who is at the table, and the Postmaster-General in another place to look at the effect of the increase of nearly 50 per cent in postal charges. In this event the Government might even consider re-opening post offices on Saturday mornings and giving us a httle service, something which is terribly lacking. However, I doubt that the Government would achieve that success and provide that service to the public. I refer now to bulk postage rates for periodicals. Again we see an attack on those who cannot afford it. The people who use this service and the people who need it are mostly charitable organisations that operate on a non-profit level and whose only means of communication with the public and their members is by posting periodical newsletters. These organisations have always been able to enjoy a measure of low-price postage. In the next 12 months the rate for to material of this kind willriseby 50 per cent and from 1975 it will increase a further 33 V> per cent, which in total effect means that in 12 months there will be an increase of about 100 per cent. Telephone rental charges have increased for the The ordinary person from $55 a year to $75 a year. For business people the rental has increased from $55 to $85. One can understand that there a need for an increase considering the present economic situadon, the cost of living increases and so on. It seems to me that a 50 per cent increase is a bit steep, even in this day and age. Perhaps the Government has anticipated that the rate of inflation will be as high as 50 per cent. The Minister stated in his second reading speech that it was inequitable for the private individuals, the residents, to bear the added cost increases due to the actions of the Opposition in rejecting the postal charges in July. The Governrement has decided, in its undoubted desire to the private sector, that it is to be the industry sector that will pay the added cost to make up the amount that is claimed to be lost. What a ridiculous situation we have. A Minister says it is for the residents to carry the cost. he reaUy beUeve that industry will carry all charges? Wage costsrisealmost weekly. Industry has had increased costs slanted at it direction. Industrial operations have in business because after aU, as I Government is have pointed out often enough, without employment. The situation is that a proportion of the costs will have to be passed on. History shows over and over again that if the cost of a single article is increased by a very low percentage, by the time the article passes through the various sectors of the industry, the retailers or any other organisation, the price of it multiplies immensely. The end result is that in order to protect itself, as it must if it is to survive, the charges incurred in carrying these costs are passed on to the public which will be far worse off overall. The obvious thing is that any cost factor must increase the level of inflation. It does not matter what small percentage of inflationary level is achieved, it is still adding to the growing burden. We know that the Government's action towards the decentralised industries is definitely a joke. The Government has no real desire to decentralise industries.",62
227,Mr LUSHER ,Absolutel y not.,64
228,Mr BOURCHIER,"Absolutel y not, as my colleague says. It is a joke with this Government. Let us look at the 1972 election. Members of the Labor Party made very guarded statements. They covered themselves fairly carefully, but that is understandable because they are a crafty lot. They made pseudo promises that there would be standard telephone charges throughout the country. They said they would look into this matter. They said that this would be the greatest thing for country people and industries. What did we find? They did not carry out that promise. Instead they lifted the country differential on telephone rentals, which meant that not only industries but also the poor people the Government is supposed to protect, including the pensioners, copped an extra blast. The Government has now increased rentals with no differential for people in the country. Country telephone charges are so much higher because country people have to make trunk-line calls more often than their city competitors, but they will be caught up also in the web of higher telephone rentals. I suggest that the Government should look at the situation and try to do something for industry. The cost for calls from risen from 5c to 10c- a mere 100 per cent increase. It is not a bad sort of increase. I think I heard the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Cohen) complaining about a 100 per cent 200 per cent profit being made on imported goods. He should ask his own government how it justifies the sort of cop now proposed. After all, who will pay that great charge? Surely not called rich person who has a telephone in his own home; it will be the poor people and the to low-income earners who will be slugged. In second reading speech the Minister points to an agreement with the Umted States and the United Kingdom which will enable us to have a faster postal service. This will be great, because the quickest way to get a letter from Bendigo to Melbourne will be to post it through the US. It now takes two or three days to get a letter from Bendigo to Melbourne, so it will be a great bit of service. I am sure the people in my area will be delighted. It takes the people who hve 40 or 50 miles out of Bendigo a day or two to have letters delivered. Perhaps we will be able to send letters through the US. It might be a bit more expensive but we will be able to get a bit of service.",64
229,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,You are just hostile with employees.,64
230,Mr BOURCHIER,"The employees are forbidden from giving service because the Government has cut it out. The proposed improved service is great news. Perhaps we will find some service boost to our local area. The way we are heading reminds one of the situation in another country where one is lucky if his letter is delivered at all after posting. Recently there was a train travelUng from town to town loaded with baggage cars, each totally stacked with maU, because the postal authorities under that particular sociahst government were so lax and disorganised that the easiest way of getting rid of maU was to put it on the train and send it off. A lot of that maU was lost completely because it was on that train. I hope that the Postmaster-General's Department does not get to this tragic stage. Let us hope it takes some positive steps to promote something that the people in this country need-a n efficient serviceinstead of driving them to outside services. The Government always wants to attack industry. I think it was the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) who mentioned something about the private industry sector taking business away. Do honourable members blame industry for going to private organisations when they will pubhc telephones has give service? People in the major areas of Melbourne and Sydney are paying considerably more to use the to private service to distribute their document exchange because they can get service when they want it. They are prepared to pay for it. This is a great loss to the postal organisation. Service is the sosomething that unfortunately this Government seems to lack. The increases proposed will lead a 0.3 per cent increase in the cost price index. It his is not a very great percentage, but as I said earlier it will build up and will add to the growing amount of inflation. If automatic wage indexation were introduced-the Government seems to be a httle partial to that-the result would be a 0.4 per cent increase in wages. Who bears that cost? The pubhc, again, or industry, which in turn passes it on. What about the possible and probable demand by unions for extra wages over and above indexation? It is unbelievable that the Government will put up charges without there being an immediate demand by all the unions concerned with the Post Office for increased wages. I would say that a fairly large demand will be made within one week. Finally I would comment that if this case had been considered by the Prices Justification Tribunal in its existing role it probably would have disallowed that part of the price increase that was based on cost increases which are not yet officially certain. The Minister said that the increases were required to ensure that the rates which customers pay for Post Office services are sufficient to cover costs and also to provide a surplus which can be re-invested to help meet the growing demand for services. He also indicated that the new charges were based pardy on likely increases in wage rates and were designed to give an expected profit of $60m. In other words, the whole exercise has been based on probable increases. Surely to goodness that is a backward approach to the matter. An alternative method may have been to obtain funds for future capital investment by borrowing. I do not know whether this was considered. It would appear to me that there could be some advantage in borrowing funds, covering interest rates and repayments over a period and carrying them at a much less cost to the pubhc in general",64
231,Mr KEOGH ,"Bowman) (3.45)-Let me explain what would happen if we foUowed the logic of some of the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Bourchier). In his remarks on this legislation, he suggested that the increased postal charges would contribute very greatly to the inflationary situation in Australia. The obvious consequence is that if the Government could decrease its charges sufficiently it might cure inflation. That is an example of the negative type of thinking which the Opposition constantly puts forward in this chamber. The honourable member went on to say-h e had some agreement from one of his colleagues whom we have come to know quite well in the short period that he has been here for his ridiculous interjections-that this Government had no interest in decentralisation. That remark was so stupid that it wasridiculousin the extreme. It is a pity that the honourable member has not been in the House on more frequent occasions to hear debate on legislation introduced by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development ( Mr Uren). It is a pity that the honourable member did not take the opportunity in the last couple of days to note some of the real development that has been proposed by this Government for the Albury-Wodonga area. It is unfortunate that he did not reflect on the pitiful record of his own Liberal-Country Party Government which, in the 11th hour of its great number of years in office, suddenly found an interest in decentralisation when it realised that that issue would be a real election winner for the Labor Party in 1972.",65
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Drury)-I ask the honourable member to relate bis remarks to the BUls now before the House which deal with posts and telegraphs.,65
233,Mr KEOGH,"I accept what you say, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I might say as justification for my remarks on those matters that I was replying to some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bendigo. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), who led for the Opposition parties in this debate, contrasted the attitude of the Opposition on this occasion with its attitude to these proposals when they were last before the Parliament. On that occasion, the Opposition parties in the Senate decided to use their numbers to prevent this Government from obtaining the passage of the legislation proposing increased postal charges as they were detaUed in what is commonly known as the 'mini-Budget' which was introduced in July this year. On this occasion the Opposition parties take a different attitude and will aUow these measures to be passed. Members of the Opposition must bear in mind that their decision to prevent the passage of these measures in July is the major contributing factor why some additional charges had to be added on this occasion. The reasons for those increases in postal charges have been explained by the Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen). The new ordinary letter rate of 9c, proposed in July, has been increased to 10c in this legislation. I instance that in explanation of what the real situation is. The action of the Senate in July with respect to these charges is typical of how the Opposition has behaved, particularly since the last election. It operates somewhat as a government in exUe. Its action in the Senate in July in rejecting the measures introduced by the Government showed it was behaving in a rather irresponsible fashion. This was well known and publicly proclaimed in those days not just by speakers from the Government side in this House and in the Senate but in fact by the national Press. It was well recognised in those days that the decision by the Government was a responsible one. It was in keeping with the statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) at the Premiers Conference on 7 June when he let the Premiers know quite clearly that the attitude of this Government would be to ensure that it made departments providing pubhc services, such as the Post Office, pay their way. He also clearly indicated to the Premiers that he would expect that they would balance their budgets, would make a real effort to see that departments in the various States which were expending large sums of money would adopt a more responsible attitude, and would make sure that they were able to raise revenue to match that expenditure. So, the decision announced by the Prime Minister at that Premiers Conference, when he made it publicly known that the appropriation for the Post Office in the 1974-75 Budget would be held at last year's level of $385m, was instrumental in ensuring that the legislation came forward as quickly as possible. It was introduced into this chamber in our July sittings. We have today the need to consider fresh legislation because the Government was prevented in July from enacting the legislation proposing those increased charges. It is all very well for the Opposition to claim that on this occasion it is going to do a great service by allowing the Government's legislation to pass and to become law, while pointing out the injustices of the increase. It is as well to remind the Opposition that some proportion of the charges which were proposed in the July measures and which are repeated in these measures are charges the introduction of which was delayed for over 12 months by the then Postmaster-General-the present Special Minister of State sitting at the table-as those measures were to be associated with the 1973-74 Budget which, I would remind honourable members, was thefirstBudget of this Labor Government. The then Postmaster-General clearly indicated to the House that definite proposals had been put forward to the previous Postmaster General-the y were documented and made available to Mr Lionel Bowen as Postmaster General when he assumed that responsibility; and it was he who made these disclosures-to provide for increases of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent in postal charges. If the Liberal Country Party Government had remained in office following the 1972 election, those new charges would have been introduced in the 1973-74 Budget. But the imposition of those charges, proposed for that Budget, were held over by this Government. It is only now that the Government has faced the need to increase the various postal and other charges associated with these charges. Some of the money problems that confront us today in the administration of the Post Office are shortly to be overcome. This will result from the responsible decision made by this Government soon after it came to power to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the Australian Post Office. The report of that royal commission is well known to honourable members and the decision of the Government following the receipt of that report is well known also. Before very long, legislation will be introduced to provide for the restructuring of what we know today as the various services of the Post Office into 2 separate commissions. While that action will not solve all the problems of the Post Office, it will go a long way towards solving some of the problems that have been commented on by honourable members opposite and also some of the problems that we recognise do exist today. There is no running away from the fact that the charges that have been introduced in these measures have been introduced in an effort to adopt a responsible attitude towards the need of the Post Office to pay its way, to ensure that it is able to meet its commitments from the charges it imposes. We reject absolutely the principle we saw put into operation so often by the previous Government of making the taxpayers foot the bill for some of the very privileged measures that were introduced from time to time. Some of those measures prevented people in electorates such as the one I represent getting what might be referred to as a fair share of the Post Office cake. For a number of years I sat in this chamber and in Budget after Budget saw the situation of my electorate of Bowman-and in general the position in Queensland followed a similar pattern-de teriorate year by year. Year by year the provision of telephone services to people in oudying metropoUtan areas clearly got worse and worse. I dealt with this at some length in a previous Budget debate, in 1972 I think. On that occasion the estimated demand in the previous year for telephone services of 33,250 had fallen some 4,000 short of the actual demand of over 37,000. I ascertained from avaUable statistics that this was a general pattern and it has got worse and worse year by year. When I sought a reasonable explanation for this through various means available to me I found that the obvious answer was that people in these areas were not being given the share of the Budget that they should have been getting. They were not being given the opportunity to have the lines and the services made available to them through the establishment of new telephone exchanges, simply because of the discriminatory pohcies of the previous Government. I refer particularly to the famous country line program that was introduced. It was introduced unashamedly by the then Postmaster-General at the behest of the Country Party to provide a commitment measure of service to country areas. I am sure we would all recognise that it was good to be able to provide some service for them but this measure of service was provided in a fashion that discriminated most severely against the people the metropoUtan fringe areas and in many other developing areas throughout the length and breadth of Austraha, to the extent that they just could not get telephones. They waited the reasonable time of 4 years or more for the connection of a telephone to their homes. I am particularly pleased to see that finally, after aU the years I have been watching the situhas ation, a point was reached in Queensland where the demand for 1973-74 was just about a line baU with the estimated demand. The estimated demand disclosed in the previous Budget Papers was for 57,000 connections in Queenslandrefer to appUcations for telephone services involving the provision of new Unes or equiptricity ment. The actual demand for 1973-74 amounted to 56,151 telephones, so finally, because of the introduction of pohcies by this Government, people in these areas are starting to get a fair They are getting to a point where they have a reasonable chance of getting a telephone. It is not just my opinion that the reason they were at disadvantage previously was that the Postmasdivisions ter-General was prepared to instruct his officers to give preference to very expensive connections of services to remote station properties. This was in obvious from the information avaUable to us. I ments, have refer to a letter I received Posts and Telegraphs in Brisbane dated 13 July Ught, electricity,services 1972 in reply to representations I had made couples buy thesegas, about telephone services in the metropoUtan thinking that theyblocks area that had been delayed for a considerable than what is put forward to themanything are time. The letter said: It is agreed that the preferred arrangement would build-up adequate, resources is being done to the maximum extent possible, within the limitations of available finance. The Director went on to disclose the reaUties of the situation by saying: The position is particularly acute in Queensland in comparison to other StatesAnd well I knew that from the fact that we were falling further and further behind year by year when comparing demand to estimated demand. He continued: The position is particularly acute in Queensland in comparison to other States as we have had a relatively high level of demand for telephone service over a lengthy period. I recognise that also. The letter went on to say: The recent legislation governing the provision of rural telephone services has also resulted in a huge depanmental in Queensland relative to most other States. Clearly, the representations of the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Corbett), whom I understand was principally responsible for the in introduction of the discrimination in favour of country lines, were successful in respect of the area about which he was concerned at the expense of areas such as those represented by me unand the honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr simple Robinson), whom I know would readUy agree with me about the problems confronting people in the fringe metropoUtan areas in obtaining telephone services. I am not saying that the problem been entirely solved but I am delighted to see that a situation exists now where finally we have caught up with demand. We can look forward now to seeing people moving into homes in the new suburbs of our cities being able to get teleI phones in the relatively near future with the same ease as they are able to get water or eleclaid on. As far as I am concerned, this essential service should be avaUable to them as readUy as other services. There is absolutely no the excuse for this not being so. go. I do not want to indicate that I am laying the entire blame for the situation on the administration of the Post Office. I recognise that there is a a real problem, particularly in respect of some subthat are developed by the types of developers who completely lack any conscience these matters. I am sure most honourable members, when driving past residential developseen the very attractive bUlboards as from the Director of claiming 'All available-telephone , etc.'. Unfortunate young of residential land not buying on the other attractive brochures they get or on the attractive hoardings showing the alleged dehghts of the sites they be to are about to purchase. They do not realise that within the Department and this they are being hoodwinked by the developers, many of whom have not even bothered to contact the Post Office tofindout if these services are available. The developers beheve they can mislead the purchasers of the land, who unknowingly take them at their word, purchase the land and find that the services are not available. I think I mentioned this point to the Minister previously when he held the portfoho. As he now represents the Postmaster-General in this chamber I might suggest it to him again. I ask that he take whatever action it is possible for him to take to see that there is a better liaison between the local authorities and the Postmaster General's Department. I ask that he explore every avenue available to hin to see whether it is possible for the local authorities to lay down some clear and definite terms for developers of new estates to ensure that where it is not possible for the Postmaster-General's Department to provide these services within a reasonable time- I agree that at times it may not be possible-this is clearly indicated to the local authority and some enforcement or restriction is placed on the developers to ensure that they will tell the truth, the factual story, to people purchasing home sites. Purchasers of blocks of land would then know that a telephone connection would not be available. They would know that because of a lack of telephone exchange equipment, trunk hne or minor equipment a telephone service might not be available for some years hence. If these details were known to purchasers the Department would be relieved of some burden of blame. Whilst I am happy to hear from my constituents many of them would be saved the trouble of ringing my office to find out that they have been hoodwinked and treacherously tricked by the developers.",65
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Drury)-Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,68
235,Mr GILES ,"Angas) (4.6)- I always admire persons like the honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Keogh) and the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) who try to justify a Government decision when it is tough and unpopular. I will, therefore, be far more moderate in my comments about their speeches than I would otherwise have been. It would be wrong, however, if l were to let some of their remarks go without some form of reply. The honourable member for Bowman made a most ihurninating remark. Whilst the Opposition was blamed for delaying postal increases for 4 weeks, he explained that the Postmaster-General himself delayed such increases for a period of 12 months. I invite the House to compare the amount of the proposed increases attributed to the Opposition for the delaying their imposition with the total amount involved. It is almost as much as that fpr which the Postmaster-General can be held responsible for delaying the increases. So let us have no more nonsense about what the Opposition did or did not do. We are happy that we gave business people and other people a chance to get their houses in order and a lot of their work done in the certain knowledge that increases in various telecommunication and postal facility charges would be introduced in this Budget. Today the honourable member for Bowman complained bitterly about everything the Opposition did and then admitted that the Government also was to blame. The Government has a job to do and we do not oppose it on this occasion. It is only right that I should do as the honourable member for Bowman did on behalf of his electorate, on behalf of Brisbane and perhaps on behalf of Queensland and make one or two comments in relation to my own area. He said that at long last he feels that his electorate is getting a fair go with respect to telephone connections. Let me instance a case with which I have been concerned and ask him whether his definition of a fair go applies. I have made representations on behalf of a young doctor who has been appointed to a modern hospital in Adelaide. Telephone cables passed through the end of his block which is 4 miles from the centre of the fairly major town of Murray Bridge. He applied for a telephone connection expecting to be charged between perhaps $200 and $400 for it. He was asked to pay $8,000 for the connection. I stress that his block was within 4 miles of Murray Bridge, telephone cables went through the end of it and within a few yards of his house. The honourable member for Bowman spoke of a fair deal for his people. He can hardly blame a Liberal member, not a Country Party member, for asking what is fair. There are people in my electorate which is comparatively close to Adelaide who are being asked for sums in excess of $ 10,000 for telephone connections.",68
236,Mr JAMES ,They have a quid too.,68
237,Mr GILES,"I know that the honourable member for Hunter is a fair man so I ask him: What is fair? Is it not reasonable that a person who can catch public transport to work in the morning but who may choose to use his own vehicle should perhaps pay a share of the total cost of telephone facility installations? That is the sort of principle that was adopted in the past. The honourable member for Bowman said that at long last he thought that people in his electorate seeking telephone connections were getting a fango. Perhaps I may comment on this aspect. South Austraha has been wonderfully well served by 2 marveUous Directors of Posts and Telegraphs. The performance in South Austraha has been second to none but now, for the first time in my experience of the last 10 years, the fringe areas Adelaide are suffering. Switchboards do not have sufficient capacity and work has not kept up to programs. I think it reasonable to ask why. I am no expert on these matters and I was not helped on this occasion by discovering from the ParUamentary Library that I could not get the Year Book for 1973-74. The last one I could get was presented in June 1973. Mr Keogh-There is a shortage of labour.",68
238,Mr GILES,"I do not know the reason but it makes life difficult for someone like me who wants to debate these measures. From the figures avaUable it is my understanding that the subvention from revenue for the Post Office in 1973-74 was of the order of $385m. The subvention for 1974-75 is again $385m. To thesefiguresmust be added the internaUy generated funds of the Post Office as a whole. Then we must ask what performance we can expect from such allocations. I know that the present Government beUeves that users should pay for facUities. Ifindit hard to argue against that view. However, according to the Treasury figures in the Budget, which is only 48 hours old, there will be an increase of 42.5 per cent in taxation receipts this year. Notwithstanding this fact, the Government has allowed no more to the Postmaster General's Department this year. It seems to me that this is inequitable. Atfirstglance it appears that the Department has not been given a fair go. The whole Budget is based on the assumption that inflation will increase by slightly more than 20 per cent during the next 12 months. How can $385m plus internaUy generated funds produce the performance required? It is common knowledge from open discussion in my electorate in the fringe areas of Adelaide that one cannot get performance if one does not have the funds. I can understand the difficulties of the Department. This year there have been enormous increases in wage costs, and I do not object to them, but to have a situation where funds aUocated for this Department are the same as for last year seems to me to be letting down the entire system. Obviously the performance cannot be as great as it was last year. People in country areas know very well what the Government is proposing and doing. Let us face it; the previous Government was culpable too. It was too good an idea for amount of revenue that the Post Office could attract into that area. This was well understood in country areas. But unless the extra amount which the Government has tacked on during the last 4 weeks, and for which it has blamed us, is going to earn a lot more than any projection that one can of find in the Vernon report, we wiU not have the capital requirements to do the job effectively. That is really the only point I properly wanted to make. I hope that I am not wide in the facts that I have been able to glean but, as I say, I have not been able to get hold of what I imagine is the latest annual report from the Department. This has made it rather difficult for me to draw a proper comparison. The only other matter I wanted to discuss at all today arises from the remarks of the honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Bowman. It has to do with what functions the Postmaster-General's Department should undertake and what functions it should not. We have already discussed- I hope we have done it properly-whethe r or not the Government has the funds to do the job and, if so, where they are to come from. The next point I wish to make is that if the Department were not so ambitious to protect its role in life I think more funds would be avaUable. Let me make one or two suggestions to the Department. It is not the first time. I have commented, for instance, on householder deliveries on behalf of various country newspapers in my area. I have been doing this on and off for some years. All country newspapers look on the competition they get from the Postmaster-General's Department as spoUing their competitive position entirely. Fromtimeimmemorial stores have advertised in the local newspaper. Chain stores rather altered the situation, but chain stores used to advertise in the local newspaper. With the advent of chain stores came the householder deUvery. Some people tended to use that system, which deprived provincial newspapers of a lot of their revenue. I just make the point in passing: Does the Department reaUy need to be in this role or could it save staffing if it were not involved in it? I do not know that I am interested in or that I wish to protect red telephones. They always seemed rather extraneous to me. But I presume that the need for red telephones has arisen because the community does not think that the facUities are being supplied by the Post Office. By and large I think members of the public are prepared to pay if they get an efficient service. I will touch on that matter again in a minute. We now have the intrusion of the Postmasterthe General's Department into the field of courier services. Why did they arise? They probably arose before the system of'Priority Paid' mail was introduced. Might I compliment the Department on the efficiency of the deliverytimesof 'Priority Paid' mail. I use that service quite consistently. It cost me a great deal but it is a very efficient service and it takes a matter of hours for mail posted in South Australia to arrive here. I repeat that I do not think people mind paying when a matter of some urgency crops up if the service is efficient. I do not object to that, but do we now need sums of money available, which are specified in these documents, to set up a courier service to be administered by the Post Office? My argument here, which touches on householder deliveries to a lesser extent, courier services and other similar services, is that surely payers' funds or loan funds can be saved if some of this side-the fringe side, if you like-of the service of the Post Office were retained in the private sector. If the private sector can do it and if people use it and if it costs the Department money to organise this, I do not think the taxpayer should be strained by providing facilities to set it up. That probably points up the deep philosophical difference between people on our side of the Parhament and people on the other side. If l might get a httle tougher perhaps I would finish by saying that the honourable member for Bowman could not quite see the the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Bourchier) when he touched on the matter of decentralisation. I appreciate by the look on your face, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have to within fairly close bounds when dealing with honourable member's remarks. Let us face it; just in my httle neck of the woods-in my commetropoUtan paratively unimportant electorate, I supposethis Government has already taxed the brandy industry out of existence, or very nearly so. It put up the price of petrol in country areas by ing away the country subsidy, resulting in increase of up to 27c a gallon in the Northern Territory. The removal of taxation concessions has taken away the Uquidity of many farmers whose back many big country towns are founded today. So that affects the entire economy in towns Uke Murray Bridge, Renmark, OodGoverment nawoopwoop, or wherever else one may go. The Government has presided over the almost complete ruination of the Australian This does not affect so much those people who are protected in the electorate of my friend from Bowman but it does affect the people who are in private business, whether that business be in main street or whether it be a rural one, in my sort of electorate. I wiU leave aside mentioning obvious things such as superphosphate, because the price has already increased from $ 15.50 a ton 4 months ago to $45.50 a ton now. I will leave that aside but will get to the fact that in my State, anyway, elected Labor Party senators and others in the State field are refusing to attend growers' meetings when they wish to register their protests. Do not let us ever wonder why there is unhappiness with this Government in those areas. why It is very real, and people like me are trying to advise the growers not to strike and withhold goods from the city. Anyway, it would be counter-productive. I think we are winning that fight. But they must be allowed the right to protest, and they will protest tremendously when every tax- country investment in a country town is hit by increased telephone charges or, if you like, petrol charges, because people in those areas use those facUities almost entirely for their job-to earn their income.",69
239,Mr JAMES ,But they have other privileges.,70
240,Mr GILES,"They do not have the privilege of television in some cases. The do not have the provision of public transport. They do not have the provision of cheapness of commuting from one area to another, and in these areas the majority of their costs of production is involved in point made by this sort of thing. I think probably one of the sUliest remarks I heard- I will not say who made it; it was made a keep little whUe ago-cam e from an honourable the member on the other side of the House who pointed to the importance of the telephone to a household. I do not deny that but, let us face it, if anyone asked me whether it was more important that Mrs Joe Blow should be has able to discuss why she and her neighbour lost 5c takat bridge the previous evening or the sorts of an costs that an industry has to meet in country areas to carry out its job under these new provisions that we are debating today, I would have on to say that there is no comparison. The honourable member for Bowman said that he was glad to see fairness of supply. AU we seek is that the in the future look at the fairness of all people in Australia, that it ensures that there is fair treatment for all of them instead of what seems to us to be a buUding up against one sececonomy. tion of the community at present. I hope that I have tried to be pleasant and the objective. I hope that thefiguresI have are not too far off the mark. If they are, I apologise, but it is due to the fact that the annual report of the Department has not been available from the Parhamentary Library today for me to study the facts and figures as I would like to.",70
241,Mr MORRIS ,"Shortland) (4.25)-I will be brief in my remarks as the Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has requested. The refusal of the Senate to ratify the proposed postal charges in July last can only be described at best as irresponsible and typical of the course of bullheaded obstructionism that has been pursued by the Opposiuon in the Senate since December 1972. The Opposiuon has aptly been described as trying to operate as a government in exile in another place. The editorial of the Melbourne 'Age' of 1 August was appropriate when it said: Higher postal charges are not so much a part of the Government's anti-inflationary program as a first step towards making the Post Office commercially viable . . . Significantly, the Opposition did not oppose the increased postal charges in the House of Representatives. Their rejection in the Senate must be seen as a tactical manoeuvre based on opportunism rather than a valid objection based on reason or pnnciple. At the time of the Senate's rejection last July of the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill of 1974, it was anticipated that if rates were not increased then the Australian Post Office could expect a loss of approximately $134m in 1974-75. Honourable members will recall that a few weeks later when the Prime Minister ( Mr Whidam) announced the deferment of the Government's child care proposals, the same Opposition set up a phoney outcry against this Government. The total cost of the child care program as promised in the election campaign of May last was almost equal to the loss anticipated to be incurred by the Austrahan Post Office. It would seem that the Opposition's priorities then were that postal charges should be lowered at the expense of a total child care program because it cannot have it both ways. Whilst good arguments can be put forward that postal services ought to be considered as a social service on the one hand or as a straight business undertaking on the other, the reality is that both points of view are incompatible. It is reasonable that the user of services ought to bear the major share of the cost of providing the services and not the general taxpayer. Hence there is a necessity for increased rates and charges. The Austrahan Post Office is the nation's largest business operation. On average, in excess of 5,000 letters are distributed and more than 6,000 telephone calls are completed every minute of every day. As such, the operation of the Post Office is a highly labour-intensive operation and depends much more on the willing co-operation of many people of differing skills and background. Because about 70 per cent of its operating costs are expended on labour and as community wage levels are rising, increasing costs are inevitable. Thefinancialdilemma facing the Australian Post Office is not unique among the industrialised nations of the world. This is referred to by the Vernon Commission in its report on page 52. The problem in Australia has been that the Austrahan Post Office for far too long has been administered as a private political preserve of the Austrahan Country Party. It was managed in line with pohcies that were based on poUtical motives rather than on sound commercial practice. One does not need to go beyond the highly expensive country telephone program initiated in 1970-71 tofindinstances where it would have been Uterally a better proposition for the Post Office to have bought the farm than to have incurred the cost of providing a telephone. Mention must be made also of the decision in 1971 to increase the Government's share of pensions and the decision of the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1972 to appoint Professor A. H. PoUard to inquire into methods of adjusting Commonwealth superannuation benefits. Resulting from his recommendations was the Superannuation Act 1973.1 know that members of the Country Party are not interested. That is why they are leaving the chamber. The Superannuation Act 1973 provided for staff pensions to be adjusted by 1.4timesthe percentage increase in the consumer price index. These actions increased future payments to past and present Post Office employees. Accordingly there has had to be a sharp increase in Post Office payments for superannuation liabUity. Post Office payments for superannuation Uability increased from $49m in 1972-73 to $104m in 1973-74, and provision for the payment of $130m has been made in the Post Office budget this year to meet the cost of this item. The present Opposition, when in Government, refused to initiate steps to place the Austrahan Post Office on a proper business like footing. It took a change in government to see the establishment of a commission of inquiry. (Quorum formed). I thank the honourable member for Wannon ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) for calhng some Country Party members to the House. It is interesting to note that it took a Liberal member of the Opposition to call the quorum. Obviously he wanted some Country Party members present to particpate in the debate. I ought to remind the House that when post and telegraph rates were altered in 1973 the Country Party endorsed the increase in telephone rates. It was only interested in objecting to increased postal rates on country newspapers. It is not really concerned about increases in telephone rates. As I was saying, the present Opposition, when in government, refused to take the steps necessary to put the Austrahan Post Office on a proper business like footing. It was the present Government which after the election of 1972 estabhshed the commission of inquiry into the operations of the Post Office. The point that has been largely overlooked in relation to the new rates is that the introduction of a standard postal article is a very worthwhile step forward in the handling of mail. The standard postal article in many instances, as it covers most sized letters, will result in a saving of postal charges. A standard postal article will be be any item of mail between the dimensions of 90 millimetres by 140 millimetres and 120 millimetres by 235 rnilhmetres. As there is not any weight limit, no doubt this will result in a substantial saving in postal charges. The other matter that has been mentioned, the increase in pubhc telephone charges, is again a course that was prescribed by the Opposition when in government. When the telephone equipment was installed in 1963 provision was made for 5c steps only. Because of the mechanism of the telephones, the only step up that can be made from a 5c charge is an increase to 10c. This ought to be brought to the notice of the people of Austraha. The increase in domestic telephone rentals from $55 to $65 is an increase of $10 as compared with an increase of $30 for commercial rentals. I trunk it is proper that business telesaid: phone rentals be higher than domestic telephone rentals. After all the charge for business telephone rentals is a deductible item for taxation purposes because it is an expense item in the profit and loss account of the business. I think it is proper that the householder be not called upon to subsidise business telephone rentals. I make one final point in referring to the that increased telephone costs and increased telephone charges will have on the average householder. It has been completely and concannot veniently overlooked by members of the OppoMinister sition in this debate that the aboUtion of radio and television receiver hcence fees represents saving to almost every member of the compartments munity of $26.50 a year. If one were to deduct from that the $ 10 per annum increase in the phone rental one would be stiil left with a saving of $ 16.50.1 doubt that even members of the tralian Country Party would be writing more than 550 letters a year, which would be the number that would be required to take up the saving that would result. So, even if the difference is only $16.50, the non-payment to the Post Office of a television and radio receiver's licence wiU more than offset the increased postal charges. The point of aU the opposition from, in particular, the Country Party to increased postal charges relates not to domestic maUs but to the charge imposed on the carriage of country newspapers. Anybody listening to this debate a Uttle earUer would have heard a number of comments made on this matter. It would be a very interesting exercise to conduct an inquiry into the ownership of country newspapers and the country media to see who benefits most directly from the loss suffered by the taxpayer on the carriage of country newspapers by post. That is the matter of real interest. I for one believe that if newspapers are a commercial operation they ought to be carried at a commercial charge. If they are a business they ought to make their proper contribution towards the cost of providing a service, just as a householder has to do.",71
242,Mr KING ,"Wimmera) (4.36)-I would like to make a few comments in relation to the measure before the House. I would like to commence my remarks by referring to that paragraph of his second reading speech in which the Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen) made reference to the fact that as far back as the Premiers Conference of 7 June it was known pubhcly that the Post Office's appropriation in the Budget would be held at last year's level of $385m. That is the first point he made. A litde later on the Minister After close study, the Government has also decided that it would not be appropriate to cut Post Office capital investment by some further $30m and let existing telephone applicants increase by 40,000 to 163,000. That would mean a telecommunicauons engineering construction program 6 per cent below the 1973-74 level of effort. Why did the Minister want to refer to the cut of $30m and then decide that he was not going to effect make a cut? That reminds me of the husband who was praised because he gave up belting his wife. There is no need to mention such a thing. I understand what it all means and why the has referred to it. As for keeping the appropriation at the same level as last year, I chala lenge the Minister to indicate with what other dethe appropriation has remained at the same low level as the previous year. I do not teleknow of any. Although I have not studied the position I would venture to say that there would Ausbe very few, if any. It would appear that the Special Minister of State has been successful in his original goal to make every section of the Postmaster-General's Department pay its way. I do not agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Morris) in this respect. There are certain sectors of the Postmaster-General's Department that must of necessity automatically be a cost against the rest of the Department, or if you like, the taxpayers. Basically this Bill, Uke many others, is a slug against users of the telephone and postal services. There is no disputing that. It seeks to increase considerably many charges. I cannot accept the statement by the Special Minister of State that if the Senate had passed the original measure some two or three months ago it would not have been necessary to impose further increases. It seems strange that because the Senate did not accept the proposed increases of a few months ago the cost of telephone connections should go up automaticaUy by 25 per cent. The same thing appUes as far as telephone rentals are concerned. As I said a moment ago, this BUl is a slug against aU telephone and postal users. Sinular legislation was blocked in the Senate on a vious occasion. There are many people outside this Parliament who would Uke to see it blocked again, but, being a Budget measure, that cannot be done. Is it possible that the Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) or someone else in the Governsame ment wants to get the Government into a posment ition where it can go to the people again by forcbe ing another double dissolution? Is that one of reasons why the Special Minister of State has forward this proposition at this stage? Let us have a look at the proposed increases. The postage rate for an ordinary letter is to be increased from 7c to 10c. That is going to be terrific slug on those people who use the postal service considerably. The cost of telephone is to rise from 4.75c to 6c. That is a pretty high percentage rise, I can appreciate the practical side of increasing pubhc telephone charges insofar as the use of coins are concerned, but a pretty severe slug to increase the charge from 5c to 10c. That will be done over a period time, depending on the rate of conversion. Let us have a look at the telephone rental ation. The rental charged for an ordinary private telephone is to be increased from $55 to $65 and for a business telephone from $55 to $85. One automaticaUy includes in the business sector the primary producer, unless he can declare that telephone is used predominantly for social caUs, that he does not wish to have his name included in a telephone directory as a primary producer but as Mr Joe Blow, and that he does not make claim in respect of his telephone as far as any taxation deductions are concerned. All I can say to the primary producers on this point is that they ought to have a very close look at their financial situation. It may be advantageous to them to declare themselves in such a way. I have spoken to lots of primary producers about making claims for telephone expenses for taxation purposes and I have been told by many of them that the opportunity to make such claims does not mean a great deal to them because they are not paying any tax, thanks to the present Government, as they have not been able to show a profit although they have shown profits in previous years. When one looks at some of the new charges one will find that a substantial increase is involved in many cases. If one compares the existing rates with the new rates one will find any amount of instances where the increase involved is 50 per cent and in some cases 100 per cent. In certain instances it is 300 per cent. A comparison of some of the present charges with the charges imposed a few years ago by the Liberal-Country preParty Government will reveal that many of the people who will now have to pay a telephone rental of $85 were paying in the vicinity of, I think, only $27 at thattime.That is a substantial increase. All of these things are happening at the time as the Postmaster-General's Departhas been reducing services. I do not want to personal insofar as individuals in the Departthe ment are concerned. I beheve, as I have said in put this chamber before, that there are many very loyal and sincere members of the Postmaster General's Department who are prepared to do everything that they are asked to do and do it very efficiently. It is because of the overall pohcy a of the Government that they are directed to follow that they cannot provide the services they caUs used to be able to provide. The Postmaster-General's Department has it is become so removed from being a service department that it is almost a second taxation departof ment. That is what it appears to be to many people. The service formerly provided has been whittled away, slowly but surely. I recaU what situhappened not so very long ago when the first move was made against Saturday morning operations. The 3 hours trading that we used to have of a Saturday morning was reduced to one hour. That one hour was vital and important because it the gave the personnel an opportunity in many instances to sort maUs and to send them on their way. There are any number of Ulustrations which I can give today of maU being posted as late as a Thursday of one week which is not delivered until Tuesday of the next week witlun the same State. I am referring now to Victoria, which is not a very big State. It should not take very long for a letter to get from one side of it to the other. can give illustrations today if required of mail being posted on a Thursday afternoon and not delivered before Monday and in some isolated cases Tuesday of the following week. Yet the honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Morris) criticised the country people for demanding an adequate postal service. I wonder how many of his constituents would demand something better if they had mails posted on Thursdays and not delivered to their destination until Tuesday of the next week. This is a very poor situation as I see it. What else has happened? I turn to telephone connections. I regret to have to say that in instances there have been extended think of the country automatic telephone exchanges which, as I said, almost came to a standstill. That is not quite right, but it appears that in my area they have slowed down. At the same time the costs for upgrading purposes to many of the subscribers has been substantial. think my colleague, the honourable member for Mallee ( Mr Fisher) or the honourable member for Darling Downs ( Mr MCVeigh)-it was probcountry ably both of them-hav e referred in this House the individual cost of installing a telephone some rural areas. Mr MCVeigh-It is far too high.",72
243,Mr KING,Of course it is. It runs into not only a few dollars or a few hundred doUars but in some cases thousands of doUars. The honourable member for Shortland was laughing a httle whUe ago while the previous Postmaster-General the referred to the issue and said would be cheaper to buy the farms than to install telephones on them. What a ridiculous situation. Mr MCVeigh-He seems to hke his steak for breakfast offthe farm.,74
244,Mr KING,"That may be so too, but he certheir tainly does not have much sympathy for people outside the metropolitan areas. I very reluctantly have to support this BUl. I know that it wiU a substantial effect on many people throughout the length and breadth of this country. I think it was the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) who referred to these increased costs being inflationary. The honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) tried to pooh-pooh the idea. Anyone who has any business sense at all that if costs such as telephone charges are increased this must of necessity be an extra cost which in turn must be inflationary. The position is the same with the whole Budget. I know that I am not aUowed to speak about But I the Budget, but the whole Budget, in my mind, because of its increased expenditure, will be a very big factor that will contribute to inflation. If Government expenditure goes up by 32 per cent surely that is heading in the direction of a 32 per cent increase in inflation. I say again that I reluctantly support these BiUs knowing that because they are Budget measures I have no alternative. I know that they will be a teriffic slug on many country people as are the previous increases introduced by this Government. I think they are unjust. Despite what the Vernon report might say, it has given little consideration to the aU-important issues of inflation many and decentraUsation. They would be the two delays. I vital considerations.",74
245,Mr LUSHER ,"Hume) (4.49)-There are a few things which are important to people who do not Uve in metropoUtan areas. There are a few things which are very important to those people I who Uve in the country. The telephone, the maU and the roads are 3 things which are of particular concern. There is currendy a situation in the where all these 3 services are at the worse to possible level in Uving memory. The Governin ment is introducing the most savage percentage increases in the cost of telephone and maU services in Uving memory. I do not think that people would mind so much about paying a bit more if they felt they were getting some service. But what is happening in the country areas, particularly in New South Wales, is that services are being withdrawn. We have already seen Saturday maU services go. There is no chance in world that these services on Saturdays will be that in some cases it restored. Cootamundra and Young-majo r country centres with 7,000 and 8,000 people-ar e receiving maU from the capital cities twice a week. This is an intolerable situation not only for people in personal hves but also for businesses and for people who are trying to give some sort of service to the community. A lot of these reduchave tions in the maU service in country areas have been put down to the problems with the raUways, the fact that we have union difficulties, that fuel shortages exist and that we have to cut down on the raU services and therefore the postal services. TravelUng post offices have been taken off trains. I understand that the New South Wales can see raUways department had been unhappy for some period oftimeabout the return that it was receiving from letting the Postal Department use the travelling post offices. But this is perhaps another area. The fact is that because travelling post offices are being taken off trains and because trains themselves are not running, country people are being done again. They are losing services and now they are being asked to pay more for that reduction in service. A situation seems to be developing where the Postal Department is taking advantage of the New South Wales Public Transport Comweekend. mission's difficulties in getting the trains running. It seems as though in the same way as the ties Saturday morning mail service was discontinued, these cuts in rail services are being taken advanthis. tage of to reduce other services to the country. repeat that there is no satisfactory service from the capital cities. This problem cannot all be laid at the feet of the New South Wales railways. I support the railways. I tliink that the service should be looked at and that there are ways means by which it should be improved. I know that the Commonwealth is looking at the situcause ation and is seeking involvement in the railway services. We have towns where the railway is sponsible for the basic employment. It must be ensured that this service is improved and that get a continuation of and an increase of passenneed ger and freight services in country areas where the services can be run on a sound economic car basis. But the Postal Department has to accept the responsibihty for getting the mail through. If railways cannot carry it on a satisfactory basis, then until the services can be restored the Department and the Postmaster-General (Senacost tor Bishop) surely have a responsibility to seek other avenues to see that the mail is distributed cent. through the country areas. Why have they not investigated the possibUity of using trucks to carry the maU into the country by road? I beheve that the unions will not tolerate private enterprise being employed to do this. I beUeve that if the maU is to go by road it has to go PMG trucks. But people in the country do care what sort of trucks it goes on. We do not improving care if it goes on horseback as long as it gets through. At this stage the maU is not getting through and we are being asked to pay an increase of from 7c to 10c for a service which is getting worse week by week. People will not them accept it. There is a savage enough feeling ing up in the country areas now without adding to it and without fuelling the fires with actions hke this. People are concerned. There is a ground swell of feeUng buUding up. The Government knows about it and yet imposts Uke this are savagely hung around the necks of country people. The town of Cootamundra has a population including women and chUdren of about 6,500 people. On Friday night 2 weeks ago it was decided to send around a petition to see what could be done about the rail and postal services. By Sunday evening 2,000 people had signed that petition-2,00 0 people out of a total population of 6,500 had signed the petition in 2 days over a This indicates the type of concern that exists in country areas and in smaller communiover the raw deal that is being dished out by government. We have to do something about The Government has a responsibihty to see I that people get their basic and essential services. We also have to look at the effect that this situation is having on decentraUsation-suc h decentraUsation as exists. The increase in postal rates and will do nothing to encourage people or businesses to estabUsh and in some cases it will businesses to close down. People who live in the cities and who do not venture out into recountry areas do not have any understanding of the costs that are incurred in trying to get simple we things Uke spare parts out to the people who them in the bush. A person in business in the country who needs a spare part for a motor or a truck has to make three, four orfivetelephone calls to Sydney or Melbourne. That is a ridiculous state of affairs. Each one of the telephone calls costs $2, $3 or $4. A person in Sydthe ney who requires a spare part can ring up for 5 c or 7c but it costs doUars to make an equivalent Postal phone call from Young, Cowra or Tumut. That is bringing country businesses to their knees. That cost is now to be increased by up to 50 per We cannot accept a situation Uke this; it is completely and the Governmentintolerable. The Postal Department must be seen to be trying to do something about it. I know that the Governon ment has problems. But no effort seems to be not made. Suggestions are put up about ways of the services. But the Government does not seem to be interested in considering those suggestions. When is something concrete going to be done? When are we going to get a better deal for country people without just asking to pay more and more through the nose buUdand to get less and less for it. A chap from Boorowa wrote to me and pointed out that the railways and the Postal Department had frigged up the mail in that town to such an extent that it comes in about once every being 10 days. I do not understand and he does not understand why it is that the mail cannot be on to a train that will go into a stauon where can be delivered to the area. Why is there so inflation. much inflexibihty? Why does the Postal DepartWe ment have to keep sending the mail out the same way when the Department realises that it has be off-loaded and sent back when a train runs? Why cannot they re-route the mail? No one seems to be aware of the human and economic problems that are being raised by the savage imposts. There are problems for people who hve on the fringes of telephone districts. For them a call two or three miles up the road is trunk call. It seems that considerauon is not being given to rationalising the areas within which one can make a call for the basic charge. lege. The people who hve on the fringes of these district like everyone else are issued with a telephone book. The people who Uve in metropoUthese tan areas are issued with a telephone book which covers all of the telephone numbers wbich they are Ukely to ring in the next 5 years. But the teleit. phone book issued to people in fringe areas is adequate in many cases and it could cut out about 5 nules up the road. These people are entided to be issued with the telephone directory for the adjoining area which may be as close as couple of miles away. If a person wants the teleto phone book for another district he must go and buy it. I do not understand why the Governwho ment cannot give consideration to these people people. who have a genuine problem. Many of them have services which are being reduced or are being cut out. But the people in these httle will not receive any assistance from the Governproposed ment, assistance which would not cost the effort Government very much at all. We have to bring about a reaUsation of the problems which these people face. We have bring the Government to an understanding of the Utde people who have to work and slave country areas. We have to make government aware of the problems. I know that this Governwant ment has not been in office for very long perhaps the situations have not changed much from the time when those on this side of the House were on the other side. But the Governwant ment has to take into account the genuine future interests of these people. At least we made effort to take things into consideration. We now faced with a Government which is aUowing industrial unrest to run riot, inflation to accelerlems ate to record levels, and every conceivable econregret omic dislocation to occur, with the consequent increases in costs for basic services wbich should be avaUable and for the retraction of services country areas. We cannot just accept the fact put innation is causing these problems because we it have to get back to the underlying causes of that cannot just sit back and say that this is happening, therefore that has to happen, beto cause it is not good enough and the people wiU not accept it. Unless the Government wants to aggravate a situation in which people will pick up their scythes and pitchforks and march on cities, it has to be prepared to think more seriously about the problems that these people face. Right at the guts of the problem are the posts and telea graphs, raU, roads and the rest of the essential services which everybody ought to be entitled to as a matter of right and not as a matter of priviI urge the Government to give consideration to matters and to these people. The Government is running the country in such a shpshod and mishandled fashion that everyone is feeling People out in the country feel it twice as badly. not If commodities are short they are twice as short in the bush. We have to see that country people not get a reasonable go. No one wants to see them get any more than that. They do not expect to get a more than that. They elect their representatives this place in the same way as do city people. It out is those representatives who come down here will continue to call for a fair deal for those I want to conclude on that note. The Government ought to see that a department like the areas Postmaster-General's Department or the corporation is seen to be making that because if it is not seen to be making that effort the Government will continue to generate justifiable unrest and disquiet in country areas and no one, particularly country people, want to to see that sort of situation exacerbated.",74
246,Mr GRAHAM ,"North Sydney) (5.4)- I will not speak at length on this matter. However, I to make a few comments in support of what and was said by my friend the honourable member for Hume ( Mr Lusher) about the significance of postal services for people in our community. I to add to that some comments about the position, as I see it, which is beginning to an emerge. I would be indeed happy if I were able are to encourage my young friend, the honourable member for Hume, to beUeve that these probwUl be solved in the very near future. I to say, however, that I am certain that they will not be solved. The inflation rate in Australia is likely to reach 20 per cent by Christmas and in this will have its impact upon the program of that development witlun the Postmaster-General's Department in a very serious way during the next 9 months of this financial year. We will then face the situation where the programs for 1975 and 1976 to be announced in the 1975 Budget will require enormous increases for the Postmaster-General's Department. Whilst we are aware of the fact that the trade union control within the Department is very profound and very significant, whilst we are aware of the fact that that great Department is absolutely vital to the economy and to the welfare of the Austrahan nation, and whilst we are absolutely sure that we know that this great Department can be strangled by industrial action, we must admit that over these next 9 months the most likely scene in Austraha will be that of further disruption and further effects of the tionary process upon the Postmaster-General's Department. I think that this is extremely significant and will affect the plans by the State governments for decentralisation. People are not going to move to country areas with businesses if their costs are going to be correspondingly increased. A quite considerable amount of information revealed by various committees shows that the customers themselves were more anxious about their services than they were in particular about the cost of them. It is not only the cost of outgoing calls but the cost of inconvenience to metropolitan based associates needing to effect trunk line calls which in many cases results in a loss of business. As honourable members will appreciate, this is an operational problem for companies which would seek to move out of the great metropolises to some of the expansion areas that have been defined by the State governments and by the Commonwealth Government. This is an enormous problem for us and I feel that this Department will reflect the problem in the way I have indicated. At this moment, as honourable members know, there is an added burden throughout the world of something like $20,000m to $26,000m which has been put on account with the indusPostmaster-General, trial Western nations. The effect of this will faced in Austraha, not only as a result of the internal inflationary processes resulting from wage increases but also because of this problem that arises on the international scene. We must understand also that at present our balance of payments, our overseas funds, are dimimshing at something of the order of $ 16m per week and that by thetimethe Budget of 1975 comes along we will be in a situation in which I doubt very much that one will be able to encourage the honourable member for Hume to believe that there will be a substantial improvement in this service. Finally I should like to make an appeal to the Minister and ask him whether he can do something about second class mail. If he will be kind enough to have a word to the Postmaster General it might be possible for him to have some improvements effected in the rates of deUvery in the North Sydney area and through the Artarmon MaU Exchange.",76
247,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,"Griffith ) (5.10)- I regard these across the board increases in many of the areas of postal charges as being an exercise of deceit by the Government. Government members have stated today that the charge for posting an ordinary letter has not inflabeen altered for some time. Yet last year the Government reduced the weight of letters which could be posted at standard rate by some 25 per cent. The weight was reduced from 28 grams to 20 grams. So the public was hit hard there. The Government also introduced a system under which, if a letter weighed more than 20 grams, it would cost 15c to post. So the public was belted there. A few short weeks ago, the Government attempted to introduce an increased charge of 9c for a standard rate letter. Previously, the ""charge had been 7c for such a letter. The Senate, rightly or wrongly- I am not coming into that argument-rejecte d the increase. It was a move that pleased me. I post many letters. I thought that in these rather difficult days at least that was one small saving. But the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) has used the Budget to increase the postage cost for a standard rate letter to 10c. The honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes), who is not present in the House, expressed the view today that members of the Parliament speak in relation to unpopular measures according to the side of the ParUament on which they sit. I reject that. I can recall that, a few short years back when I occupied a seat on the side of the Parliament now occupied by the present Government, Sir Alan Hulme, the then increased the postage rate be for a standard rate letter from 5c to 7c. At that time, I made the plea that there was a need for a giant investigation into the Australian Post Office and I said that the government of the day, which was composed of my Party, could no longer look forward or take for granted my support when initiating such large increases. Yet today there has been an increase of nearly 50 per cent in the cost of posting a lousy letter. Mr Deputy Speaker, I say to you and to the Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen) who is at the table that it is no use to the people of Australia for different governments, regardless of their poUtical colour, to continue along the road ofjust increasing tal charges. I am quite certain that a comparison of postal costs in this country with those in other countries shows us up in a bad Ught. In fact, it costs 14c Australian to send a half ounce letter from the Umted States of America to Australia. But the same letter is posted from Austraha to the United States in one of the post boxes of the present Postmaster-General, a person will pay 35c for the equivalent service. That difference cannot be explained away simply by saying that there is a greater volume of maU in the United States. That is not good enough. It is ume that came to grips with our entire system and gave it good shake, if necessary. It is no use saying we wiU upset some people in the Post Office, let us forget about it for that reason; don't push under the carpet and slug the public once again. The pubhc cannot continue to carry the imposiGovernment tions which are being thrust upon it by the present Government. I know that will say that the Post Office wiU lose so many mUUons of doUars this year. He wiU ask me whether I am suggesting that the Government should not spend money in some emotive area to make up for the losses in the Post Office. He talk about child care or paralysed people and ask: 'Are you suggesting that we do not spend money in that area?' But if one looks at what is being ripped out of the Australian taxpayers' pockets in the form of taxation compared with the amount the Government has derived from that source over other years, one can see that the Government has more than enough money to order withstand some temporary losses until such time as the recommendations contained in the report of the expensive Commission investigate the affairs of the Post Office are implemented. I was elected to this ParUament in 1966 took my seat in 1967. In the financial year 1966-67, the amount paid in income tax by Austhat tralians was less than $2,000m. In a few short years that amount has increased to $8,000m. we take income tax as a percentage of Budget oudays, we find that when I entered this ParUathe ment income tax was 32.4 per cent of total get oudays. It has now risen to 48 per cent. Just how much more can each Australian-pen - supply. sioners, workers and others-be expected to pay? This Government is slowly strangling the initiative of every working Austrahan. he or she turns, he or she has to meet some Government scheme or service which is inefficient. I believe that the Austrahan Post posOffice is a most inefficient organisation. In this cognate debate, together with increases in postal charges, we are considering legislation to authorise the introduction by the Government of a courier service. This proposal should not only simply be welcomed with open arms. The Government says: 'This is being done privately. if We are now going to do it too'. The reason that private courier services have developed over the years is that they provide a more efficient approach to the job of delivering maU. The Special Minister of State may say that they only service needs in cities and that the Australian Post Office has, for example, to carry letters from Perth to we InnisfaU in North Queensland and that such sera vices cost more. The fact is that these small courthat ier services have met a need and are more efficient and far less costly. What is this Governit ment to do about them? It is to set up a sinular organisauon. I ask the Minister whether the has in mind for the future a scheme to forbid private enterprise entering or continuthe Minister ing in this area? We have seen the way in which the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Hayden) has set out systematically to destroy nursing homes. In the next will two or three weeks in my home city of Brisbane 2,000 people are Ukely to be affected because 23 nursing homes in Brisbane will be forced to close unless there is an increase in the subsidy paid to maintain people in those homes. Just as this socialist Government is causing that situation, is it looking at the introduction of legislation to force private courier services out of business into give the Government a monopoly in this area? Once a monopoly is established, we are on the road once again to a most inefficient that was set up to organisation. I have promised the Leader of the House ( Mr Daly) that I will not take too muchtimeof the Parhament in this debate today. But I do hope and that notwithstanding its poUtical colour, the Government wiU have the courage to recognise a great deal has to be done with respect to the Austrahan Post Office. The stage has been If reached, in a few short years, where a 5c stamp has almost become a coUectors' item. The way Government is going, in allowing inflation to Budrun, I intend tb keep my 10c stamps because, again in a few short years, they will be in short Mr Keogh-Are you not going to send me a Whichever way Christmas card this year?",77
248,Mr DONALD CAMERON,"The honourable member for Bowman asks whether I am going to send any Christmas cards this year. The answer is yes. But, regrettably, his name will have to come off my hst as I must effect some saving somewhere. I conclude with a very strong plea to the Special Minister of State that he does not continue to adopt the system of introducing further increases in charges simply to get the Government out of trouble.",78
249,Mr WENTWORTH ,"MACKellar) ataU. (5.20)-This Bill is, of course, part of the cost of the Labor Government. It is said that the country has to meet the costs of the Labor Government. I at Mr do not think that when the Austrahan people explanation elected the Labor Party to government they speech. realised howfiercethose costs were going to be. It is said that because of this increase of running the mail services postage has to go 1 think it has gone up in the course of this seat Government's short and inglorious term of office by something over 50 per cent when we take into or not. account the reduction in the weight of a letter and the present proposed increase in postal cause charges. I do not think wages have gone up as much as that, so there must be less there was. With increasing mechanisation and technology one would have expected costs to go able up a great deal less than wages. This shows the remark? fundamental inefficiency of the Government. I have never been an advocate of low wages. am an advocate of high wages with high prohe ductivity but the trouble is that in this tion there has been a continuous loss of productivity. I do not beheve that this is due to the hes. average postal employee. Most of us know our own local postal employees and are on friendly terms with them. We beheve they do a good job insofar as they are aUowed to do so. But there 2 things that stop them. Thefirstis the inherent ^efficiency of the Government and the second the industrial disruption imposed upon them, when very often they themselves do not want this disruption, by their own mihtant unions who are making disruption not to help their members in order to break the whole social system. It is unhappy fact the postal unions have to a large extent faUen under the control of Marxists. want to give an example of something only a few months old and yet is very relevant. Shortly before the elections the then Postmasterorder, General, now the Special Minister of State Lionel Bowen), went to the Redfern MaU Exchange to meet the employees. He was not companied by his own officials from that Exchange. He excluded them from the meeting I with the men although I beheve he had with him one person from his own central office.",79

I dare say we will hear more about this in the near future. I am told and verily beheve that the Minister put his signature on those demands at the meeting. He spoke to the men behind the backs of his own officers at the exchange, although he did have others with him. He excluded from the meeting people from his own exchange, people who were in charge of the exchange. He capitulated to the men, and it is most improper. If this story be true, the Minister did something which was dishonourable and it should entail his resignation from the Ministry. No Minister is entided to make election pledges with pubhc money and say ' I will do these things if you elect me'. Do it as a Minister? Do it secretly without letting it be known? I think we will hear more of this. I will be glad to have a statutory declaration from the Minister that he did not do any of these things.",80
279,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,What about yours first?,80
280,Mr WENTWORTH,"You will have my statutory declaration in the morning. If there is a justice of the peace in the House I will do it for you tonight. We will then obtain your statutory declaration in reply. I would like to have it, thank you, since you started to make these challenges.",80
281,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Armitage)The honourable member for Mackellar will address the Chair and not the Special Minister of State.,80
282,Mr WENTWORTH,"Yes, I think that is right. I have shown that the rises in charges, which are not covering costs, are greater than the rises in wages. They are therefore due to organisational inefficiency and union disruption. I am not trying to blame the individual postal employees because I think, with some exceptions, generally speaking they are very good and they deserve the commendation of this House and of people outside this House for the work that they do. I have had postmen come to me and say:' Look, we do not want to go on strike. We do not want to disrupt the mails, but if we do not go on strike we will be victimised.' Here we have the Minister, who has had some association with trade unions, coming into this House and asking for the instruments of victimisation. I know exactly what he means when he says that. He wants to be able to victimise the people concerned. He is a trade unionist. He is one of the people who will be working these kinds of standover tactics in the unions-standin g over the men in the unions. I think he should be ashamed of himself because he used his position as a Minister corruptly to offer bribes in the wayMONICA",80
283,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,You are a disgrace to the Parhament. You should not be in this House.,81
284,Mr WENTWORTH,"Will you protect me, Mr Deputy Speaker? Will you protect me from this outrageous Mmister? I am sure you will as a fair and impartial man.",81
285,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I triink that the honourable member for MackeUar is getting quite a fair time in this House and he usually does.,81
286,Mr SCHOLES ,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. The honourable member for MackeUar had made certain charges which can be made against a member of this House only as a result of a substantive motion. I ask that you ask him either to make such a substantive motion or else to withdraw.",81
287,Mr HUNT ,On a point of orderMONICA,81
288,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Is the honourable member speaking to the point of order?,81
289,Mr HUNT ,I am taking a point of order.,81
290,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,A point of order has already been taken.,81
291,Mr HUNT ,"I will speak on the point of order along these lines, Mr Deputy Speaker: If you uphold that point of order. I would expect you to rule that the comment that the Special Minister of State at the table made both with his hands and his mouth, giving the impression that the honourable member for MackeUar is deranged or insane and should not be a member of this House, is offensive to an elected member of this Parhament. I think that there has been far too much tit for tat across the House here. If you are going to accept a point of order on that, I think that another point of order should be taken against the comments that have been made here.",81
292,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,"Mr Armitage)-A point of order was taken and the honourable member for Gwydir spoke to the point of order. I have already ruled that the Chair is not in a position to state whether the statements made by the honourable member for Mackellar are correct. I tliink that the appropriate course would be for the Minister, if he considers that he has been misrepresented, to make a personal explanation after the honourable member for MackeUar has finished speaking. At this stage I want the House to return to the BUl and to finish the discussion on it.",81
293,Mr WENTWORTH,"Thank you very much indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. I note how honourable members opposite portray their background as miUtant unionists by rising in a body over this kind of MONICA",81
294,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Mr Armitage)Order! I have already asked the honourable member for Mackellar not to stray from the BUl but to speak to the BUl. If the honourable member for Mackellar continues making personal remarks against the Minister or any other member of this House I will have to sit him down.,81
295,Mr WENTWORTH,"Very well, sir. I have pointed out that the rises in charges which are imposed by this BUl-whic h the Minister says are necessary to meetrisesin costs-ar e greater than the rises in wages. They therefore measure inefficiency in the Post Oflice. In my view, this inefficiency springs from 2 causes. First, the inefficiency of the administration-whic h is the Government-and secondly, from the calculated disruption of certain small sections within the unions concerned. I gave as an instance, and evidence, of this something which was told to me. I will make a statutory declaration in a few moments that it was told to me and I will notMONICA",81
296,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I have asked the honourable member for Mackellar to apply himself to matters continued within this BUl. I ask him to do that or I will have to ask him to resume his seat.,81
297,Mr WENTWORTH,"I would make one other point and I think it is substantial. It is the Government's philosophy apparently that charges should be made to cover the costs of services such as the Post Office. I want to examine that fundamental proposition. In my view, charges should certainly be made to cover outgoings whether for wages or for any other current expenditure. Charges should certainly cover those costs. Certainly, fixed charges should go in for accounting purposes so that we know where we stand. But with a Government service, whether it be postal, raUways, or any other service, whether it be State or Federal, it seems to me that we are now in a new kind of ball game with innation. It appears to me also that governments, as an anti-inflationary measure, should be reducing the charges for services to the current costs. I do not mean to say that they should not charge any interest but I tliink interest should be shown as a loss so that the true accounting of the service could be known because this is vital when one considers capital extensions, whether they be for the railways, the buses or the Post Office. I beheve that it is important that the accounting be kept. For these public services, one of the great things about an anti-inflationary pohcy must be surely that we should be reducing charges to the real costs. This is something which I beheve is fundamental. It concerns this Bill but it goes beyond this Bill. I beheve that this real principle should be part of the anti-inflationary pohcy. We are in a position where an anti-inflationary policy is needed, new principles are needed, and new thinking is needed. This Government, which prides itself as being a progressive government, is really the victim of the old shibboleth-it cannot really think in new terms-and this Bill shows it.",81
298,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,"Kingsford-SmithSpecial Minister of State) (5.39)-in reply-Until the last speech there had been a rather intelligent discussion as to what the Bill was reaUy all about. The BUl before us is virtuaUy the same BUl as was introduced some months ago but wbich was rejected by the Senate. The big issue today is: Why has it been necessary virtuaUy to increase the postage another lc because of the rejection of the earher BUl? Thefiguresprepared by the Department clearly show that the 2 months' delay resulted in a $30m deficit. Obviously if the Department cannot get the cashflowfrom the earnings it would have expected to receive from both telecommunications and the postal service, it has been deprived of that amount of money. The amount now to be recovered is the same amount as would have been obtained if the proposed charges had become effective from 1 August. Due to the obstruction of the Senate the Department has been prevented from getting $146m in the period from 1 August last to 30 June next. The Government is now obhged to raise that sum of $ 146m in the period from 1 October to 30 June next. It is very simple to understand that because the Post Office has been deprived of that income it has now to be raised within a shorter period oftime.Accordingly the postage charges have had to be altered. Honourable members opposite should understand that it is on that basis that the charges have had to be increased. But let us look at the rapid way in which predecessors escalated postage charges. did so in 1967, 1970 and 1971. In fact, postage rates were increased by 2c in 2 consecutive years. Although the conventions of Westminster clearly indicate that I cannot produce every detaU of what my predecessor had, within his knowledge, on the basis of wages escalating at a certain rate it is quite clear that he would have had to increase postage rates again in 1973. We have not increased postage rates since they were last increased by the Opposition when it was in government. Postage rates were increased to 7c in 1971. So virtuaUy there has been a 3-year gap, wbich never would have been within the business plan that the Opposition had in mind. I have in front of me information as to what the Opposition had in mind, and it is clear that postage rates were to be escalated much more rapidly than they have been. Opposition members have talked about innovation, but not one of them has mentioned the fact that with these proposed postage rate increases the weight limit has now been removed. In fact, the new postage rate covers all standard size letters. The concession is on the basis that the 20 gram minimum limit will no longer apply. The weight limit has been removed, provided the letter is of a relatively standard size. Most maU, of course, comes from commercial enterprise. The Post Office handles few domestic letters. People in commerce will obtain a benefit because whereas in the pastthis was the situation even under the system of our predecessors-the y would have had to pay well over 15c they will now be able to get virtually the same concession for 10c. So there has been no increase in postage rates in the commercial field. I must mention also the Vernon Commission which we estabhshed. Honourable members opposite have spoken only about the need for innovation and the need to improve the Post Office. What did they do about it? They did nothing. Every year they simply introduced a Budget which increased the rates set on the previous occasion. On that basis the Opposition is indicted because it made no survey of what was wrong with the Post Office. It took this Government to estabhsh the royal commission. The Vernon Commission has come in with its report and has said: 'Yes, separate the postal service from telecommunications'. The Opposition would not have done a thing about that. How many Post Offices were closed and how many services were lost during the Opposition's adnunistration? If it is ulegal for private enterprise to operate courier our services, as was suggested by one honourable They member opposite, why did the Opposition do nothing about it when it was in government? It let them nourish. Even though members opthe posite now claim that they are illegal, when government they allowed such services to opercountry. ate. It is perfectly legal for such services to ate. But Uie Opposition would vices be left to private enterprise than to allow the Post Office to run them. Does the Opposition say that it did not prevent the Post Office from running a courier service? It is only now this legislation that the Post Office is given the sort of opportunity that it needs to compete in field that might be deemed to be reasonable. Somebody in the Opposition back benches said that that is wrong also because it will put the vate courier services out of business. In other words, the good old Post Office can take the broken down arrangements, the long hauls, and everything that nobody else wants, but it should never be given the benefit of competing on equal basis. The Opposition should have a look at what has done with its economics. The superannuation scheme was so badly organised- I cannot blame any members of the Opposition for that; neverday's the less it was part of their Government's systheir tem-that the previous Government did not even establish what was needed in the superannuation fund. That was not known until we had the Verafternoon. non Commission. It is estabhshed now that the Post Office is some $31 lm in arrears in its annuation fund. Under the Bill now before House we have to pay the Treasury $130m for superannuation. That happened under the Ophard position Parties' scheme and under the Treasury of which they were in control. It took us out these facts. But not one member of the Oppowhereby sition has mentioned that. What is it that honourable members opposite are debating today in regard to this Bill? They are the greatest lot of whingers I have ever seen as far as talking about what is wrong with fellow Austrahans is concerned. One honourable member talked about how he would march on in life. the city with a pitchfork or something. What do they tliink the city people are-alien s or They are their fellow men. Honourable members opposite are trying to stir up this utter rubbish about what is wrong with their city brothers. They are paying the same telephone rental. honourable members opposite look at the telebreaks communications system they will see that it makes a profit only because of the fellow who uses the telephone every two or three minutes. The money that we get from the bills with which we sock those city people is what makes the plus. We do not want to go into what benefit get from it, but they are certainly paying through proper channels and making the surplus that in we spread into capital outlay throughout the That is not a new concept; it was the operconcept of any previous government, naturally, rather courier serto get its funds. Not one honourable member opposite mentioned that this Government has written off the under postal debt which the Opposition Parties graciously imposed as a result of a decision by Sir a Robert Menzies in 1960. We have written it off and saved the postal service some $17m in interest. The Opposition Parties' stupid old arprirangement from 1960 on was that the poor old Post Office had to pay interest on the money it received. The Post Office has been bogged down with all these outmoded ideas that the Opposition Parties foisted upon it. Honourable an members opposite did nothing about them; yet they come here and bash the fellows in the service. The people in Bendigo must be astounded it to hear what their member says about the postal employees in Bendigo. He virtually accuses them of being loafers who are not prepared to do a work. I will be amazed if he expects to get support the next time he fronts up for an election. That is ah he did and that is all most honourable members opposite have done this superHonourable members opposite were saying: the 'What is wrong with the workers? Why won't they work harder?' The workers are working enough. The big issue is that there has to be more incentive. There has to be some eradication to findof this outmoded Public Service structure a chap can go from the Fourth Division into the Third Division only if he has some certificate. There are chaps in the service who have no promotional incentive and no pay incentive. Are they going to be revitalised by the suggestion that they ought to work harder? Obviously there their must be some incentive, some retraining and some opportunities for them to improve their lot enemies? What did the Opposition parties do? They built the Redfern Mail Exchange, a monster of a thing from the point of view of humanity. The idea was to put a whole lot of people together If with a whole lot of mail and a machine that down perhaps more often than it should. We will not criticise the machine, because it has been improved. It was the only one of its kind in the world and there has been nothing Uke it since. Let me make clear what members of the surOpposition did and how their predecessors ran theyoff to become directors of the companies which were associated with the supply of equipment. What about that sort of arrangement? What about the thousands of people working at Redfern whom nobody ever bothers to go and see? Because I go and see them some honourable member here says to me: 'You are guilty of victimisation, corruption and goodness knows what'. Let me make it clear that I did go to see them. I went with Mr Milton Stevens, the Director of Postal Services in Sydney. The honourable member to whom I am referring was not there, of course; so he would not know. But he says that he was told that I went without anybody else. Could anyone imagine all the people in the entire Redfern Mail Exchange being able to organise a meeting without anybody else knowing about it? The meeting was arranged with the consent of the Department and everybody knew it was to be held. The television cameramen and everybody else were there and it was held with full pubhcity. Mr Milton Stevens was the departmental man there. The honourable member concerned rang my office after that and asked whether he could go there. He asked whether he could take his television cameras. I said that I would be deUghted. He went there with his own set offilmprojectors. Whatever happened to the film I do not know. I do not know whether anybody saw it. He went there to discuss the position. I do not want to give any more credit to the honourable member. He is in the eve of his political life, due to retire, and he can use words such as 'victimisation' and 'corruption' and get away with it, because apparendy under the Standing Orders, as they are interpreted, someone can slander and hbel you as much as he Ukes but you have to do your best in a personal explanation. That is not my style, and I do not intend to put any more weight on the argument that was put forward. Let us look at what we are discussing. We have now the report of the royal commission. It establishes now that the Post Office is to be a viable proposition. It is to earn sufficient to pay its way. Of course, in its postal operations, which are labour intensive, it has to pay the wages of the people who are employed. If we had adopted the Senate assessment of the situation and had been deprived of the $30m we wanted and have now got in this BUl-the Opposition has at last said it will approve it, having had second thoughts, but the position still holds if the Opposition does not approve the BUl and the BUl is rejected-ho w many thousands of men would be sacked from the Post Office? We wiU have to sack at least 5,000. Five thousand employees are depending on this BUl going through. How does the Opposition face up to that responsibUity? It was made clear to the Premiers by the Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) on 7 June that the postal allocation would remain at $385m and that he expected the Premiers to maintain their position also. As honourable members know, the Premiers have been put in the position of having to mcrease petrol charges, freight rates and everything else to maintain their services. We would not be honest if we were now to say we did not really mean what we said to the Premiers, that we will change our mind and borrow more money. This has always been the attitude of the past. Sir James Vernon was right. We should separate the postal and telecommunications functions of the Post Office, because one is viable and the other wiU possibly always need a subsidy. Look at what the Country Party did. I give it credit for doing it. On the last occasion we discussed increases in post and telegraph charges the Country Party successfuUy moved an amendment that gave very good concessions to the registered publications. Members of the Country Party will be deUghted to know that this concession will result in a loss of $ 12m in the coming year. They should not think that every charge is based on the cost of the service provided. When their country cousins have to put a 10c stamp on a letter they should remember that they are subsidising the local newspaper, which is going through the post at a cost of 2.5c or 4c. We are losing mUUons of dollars by granting a concession on these newspapers. The Country Party wiU not let us run the Post Office on the basis that everybody pays a fair rate. The registered publications, particularly newspapers in the country areas, have to be subsidised, and that is what has happened. We have accepted the position because that is the only way we could get last year's Post and Telegraph Rates BUl through. I know that the Country Party claims this concession as a great credit. It is entitled to the credit, but it must bear the odium of the fact that it has also guaranteed the people who use the postal services and the telephone services that they will subsidise country newspapers. I do not think that is fair. Mr Nixon-What about trade union papers?",82
299,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,The honourable member used that argument in another debate today. The best thing to say is this: Let us put - he Post Office on the basis that Sir James Vernon wanted. Let us have a corporation representative of people who use the postal service and who are interested in its welfare. Let us put the Post Office on a viable basis. Let us develop courier services in the Post Office. We can make the Post Office something worthwhile. Let us give the employees more incentive. Let us decentralise and develop regional concepts. Let us get away from having State directors. Let us cross State boundaries and do something that can make the Post Office really move. Let us give the man in the town and the man in the country the right to be the man who makes the decision so that he is not bound down by some bureaucratic struggle that eventually has to be referred to Melbourne to be interpreted. That is what the concept of the royal commission means. Not one honourable member opposite has mentioned that or praised it. It is the position that will apply. We wiil get rid of that wretched concept that has been with us since 1900 that because there is a River Murray you must have different sets of rules on either side of the border. What I have outlined can happen. Mr Nixon-This has nothing to do with the debate.,84
300,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,"Unfortunately the honourable member was not present during the debate. I am surprised that I have to castigate him on that point. During the course of the debate, when the honourable member for Gippsland was not here, honourable members opposite were saying how inefficient the arrangements have been. The honourable member for Hume ( Mr Lusher) spent most of his time talking about railways. I cannot solve the railway's problems, but at least I am entitled to say that we can solve some of the regional concepts if we get put into these areas people who can overcome the immediate issues.",85
301,Mr LUSHER ,But some mail goes by rail.,85
302,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,"I am sure they will be fixed by next Sunday. I am told that railway vices will be all right from 22 September 1974. This has nothing to do with the inform the honourable member for Hume that this is the position. The point I come to is this: The Senate caused the problem that honourable members opposite are now anxious to avoid, but the mathematics are there and they cannot deny honourable members opposite have stated what they feel is wrong basically in their own electorates. I come to the issue of what with the whole concept. It has been the problem of interest and failure to understand superannucannot ation habihty. The general problem has been of not giving employees incentive or an opportunity for advancement. The former Government's arrangements, which were within its knowledge, made it quite clear that service charges would have to escalate because the whole problem in this field was that the Post Office was regarded as a commercial enterprise. That has been the biggest problem with regard to rural lines. It costs at least $3,000 of the taxpayers' money to install the first 8 kilometres. That is a contribution. But if one is hving well out in the country one cannot expect the service to be provided free, which was the concept of the previous Government. That concept ran into enormous habihties of approximately $21m already expended with an annual loss because of the interest paid on it. People in those areas could not possibly use the service enough even to pay the interest charges. That was the position that had to be looked at. Not one member of the Opposition has said that this Government has reduced call charges for the first 50 kilometres, particularly after 6 p.m., to 6c. That is a great saving to many people. It is a $3m cost saving, and it shows the advantage of using the service at off-peak times at reasonable cost. The other point that is important in the whole concept of telecommunications is that it is expanding all the time. That is a good concept, but it is an expensive concept. Trunk call usage is expanding by 13 per cent a year. People are using the service. We must meet the demand. Last year we made a record number of installations-an all-time record. Demand was an alltime record also. So we must invest this money back into the business. All that Opposition speakers have done this evening is to go on with a series of complaints that they could have made in any adjournment debate. Not one of them looked at the question of how postal charges, rates or weights could be altered. Not one of them can deny that the charges appear to be serreasonable, except for the unreasonable amendments which the Opposition moved last year. debate, but I That is the position. Mr Donald Cameron-They are not unreasonable.",85
303,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,"They are very reasonable by world standards. The Opposition again wants to decry postal employees, because that. A number of that is all it did. Mr Donald Cameron- I said that the whole has been wrong system is inefficient.",85
304,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,"Opposition members face up to the fact that it is their fellow one Australians whom they are castigating all the time. Their fellow Austrahans are running the postal service. Members opposite are so upset about it, on the basis of what? The Opposition did nothing about it. It did nothing to improve the service. All it ever did was increase charges. All it ever did was give hand-outs in areas which are causing greater losses than ever. It cannot avoid the fact that it was the previous Government that put on it the great interest burden, particularly in the postal section Mr Donald Cameron-He is telling hes.",85

306,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Griffith will withdraw that remark. Mr Donald Cameron- I withdraw it.,86

325,Mr SPEAKER,Does the honourable gendeman claim to have been misrepresented?,87
326,Mr YOUNG,"Yes , I do, Mr Speaker. I refer to the debate on the censure modon which took place in the House yesterday. As reported at page 1442 of yesterday's Hansard, the Leader of the Opposidon ( Mr Snedden) made the comment during the debate that he expected the Austrahan Council Bill to come before the House today. Being one of the speakers from the Government side on the Austrahan Council Bill, I have been involved in discussions with people who have visited Parhament House in Canberra this week concerning the sections of the Bill which are causing some controversy outside this place. The Leader of the Opposition made the comment that information that had been given to the Opposition by me indicated that the Australian Council Bill would not come before the House. Mr Speaker, that is not correct. As I have said, I have held discussions concerning the Bill with people who visited Canberra. I did make inquiries as to when the Bill would come before the House. I did not at any stage talk to any member of the Opposition, includmg the Leader of the Opposition, about the make-up of the business that would come before the House. As all honourable members will understand, those of us who serve on the back benches do not have anything to do with deciding what business comes before the House. In that manner I was misrepresented in the House yesterday.

327,Dr PATTERSON ,"Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory)- Mr Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Wheat Products Export Adjustment Bill and the Wheat Export Charge Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions will of course be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the 3 BiUs to be discussed in this debate.",87
328,Mr SPEAKER,"Is it the wish of the House to adopt this procedure? There being no objection, I will aUow that course to be foUowed.",87
329,Mr SINCLAIR ,"New England) (8.3)- Mr Speaker, the 3 BUls that we are considering tonight are BUls that politically are and have been traditionally the fundamental basis upon which many Australian farmers have been able to survive the swing of the pendulum of seasons and the swing of the pendulum of markets. In the past the wheat seats, as they were called, were the seats that determined the fate of the government in this ParUament. Of course, these 3 BUls are radically different from the original stabUisation proposals that were introduced into this ParUament. One wonders how Mr Reg Pollard, a former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture- a Labor member and one of those who originaUy introduced the wheat stabUisation legislation-might regard a BUl which goes by that pseudonym but which is, in fact, more a payments equalisation measure than a stabUisation measure. Nonetheless, these 3 BUls encompass a range of assistance to the wheat growers of Australia which has resulted from discussions, if one can caU them that. They were discussions but they were conducted under a measure of duress with the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and with the members of the Austrahan Agricultural CouncU. The proposals themselves are designed to provide assistance to those who will produce wheat during the next 5 years. As members of this place and wheat growers generaUy know, the previous S-year wheat stabUisation scheme BILL 1974 was extended for a period of one year. Over that Second Reading period the present Labor Government changed generally the character of the negotiations which I had entered into prior to the change of government and indeed changed the substance of the stabUisation proposals offered to the industry. I think it is appropriate that I deal first with the measures that the Government has brought forward, rather than the alternative proposals I would Uke to have seen developed. I think it is also appropriate at this stage to say that in the industry there has been quite real concern at the delay in debating this measure in this chamber. It is 3 months and 2 days today since the BUl was first introduced into the House. The Opposition had hoped that the debate might have taken place during the July sitting. For various reasons this apparently did not meet the wishes of the Government. While the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) said in his second reading speech that there was some delay because of the 18 May election, I think that it is equally true to say that it is unfortunate that there was not an opportunity for the measures to be debated in July and for wheat growers generally to be certain of the result. However, I think there is some merit in having a look at the contrast between circumstances that prevail today and those that prevailed, not in July, but in the first of the intervening years between the termination of the preceding stabilisation scheme and the introduction of this one. Of course the significant change is that generally grain stocks around the world have dwindled mto negligible quantities. While in some countries there has been a reasonable level of production - for example in the United States of America, which is still one of the world's largest wheat producers, there is this year a record crop-grain s today are more interchangeable than they have been. No longer do those who are in the market for wheat look at wheat as only a grain produced for human consumption; rather it is seen to a greater degree than perhaps it has been in the past as one of a range of grains produced either for human consumption or for stock feed purposes. In a blend availabUity of wheat alone is not the price determining factor, but its avaUabUity relative to the avaUabUity of other grains such as corn and nulo, and also other crops such as soya beans, all of which to a degree are interchangeable, and certainly all have a place for purposes of stock feeding, perhaps more than for human consumption. The legislation consists of 3 distinct BUls, the Wheat Industry StabUisation BUl, the Wheat Products Export Adjustment Bill and the Wheat Export Charge Bill. As I have suggested, the title of the Wheat Industry StabUisation BUl is a misnomer. As I see it, it would be far better called the Wheat Industry EquaUsation BUl. The Opposition regards this as one of the more regrettable consequences of the changes which this Government has introduced. In the present economic cUmate for grains the wheat growers of Austraha will make a significant contribution to the consumers throughout Australia which regrettably will not be recognised or wiU too rarely be recognised. In the past wheat growers have been prepared to accept a domestic price plan which has provided stabUity for the industry and they have taken their chance on the export returns. For the time being the current domestic price set within Austraha for home consumption is significantly lower than the world export price. The stabUisation price set within this legislation is $2 per bushel. About a fortnight ago in the Kansas City Grain Exchange grain was being sold at US$4.61 a bushel. That was a price which it was accepted might well not be avaUable at the low point of the season and indeed, it was significantly lower than some of the prices that had been offered some weeks before. So the price being paid domestically in Australia to Australian wheat growers under this arrangement will mean a significant contribution by. the wheat growers in respect of the 80,000-odd tonnes of wheat that is used within Australia for domestic purposes. It is being offered to consumers in this country at a significant discount but wheat growers accept that as part of the provisions of this stabUisation scheme as it has been in other schemes. It is a recogmtion by wheat growers that this predetermined price does give them a basis on which they can produce profitably. Therefore they are prepared also to produce greater quantities of wheat which supplements Australia's export earnings. Assistance is also given to the provision of those funds which are necessary tofinanceour national development and the achievement of national objectives which in the past have been set by the avaUabUity of funds but today seem to be set more by the ideology of the Government than the nation's capacity to pay. Within the provisions of the scheme those aspects to which I think reference needs to be made include the degree to which the stabUisation scheme itself has been changed as far as the owners-operators' allowance from the earUer scheme is concerned. There is a change in the basis by which industry and Government will contribute to the StabUisation Fund from which amounts are to be paid to wheat growers. There is certainly a change in the terminology of the basic wheat and in this respect the Opposition completely supports the proposal of the Government. The old 'fair average quaUty' terminology has been changed to 'Australian standard white'. There have also been changes in respect of some of the provisions related to unauthorised dealings with wheat which, of course, will be reflected in the complementary State legislation. These provisions are designed to minimise across the border trading particularly in respect of wheat that is being produced on leased land. The other aspect of change to which the Minister referred in his second reading speech and which has some importance, I believe, is the requirement of the Australian Wheat Board to tender an annual report on its operations. The Opposition completely supports that aspect too. The second of the 2 Bills- I will come back to deal with each of them in a htde more detail-is termed the Wheat Products Export Adjustment Bill. This BUl really authorises the Board to require exporters of wheat products to pay to the Board the difference on those occasions when the export prices are higher than the domestic prices. So in fact an exporter, protected as he normally is against a disadvantage in export markets when export prices of wheat are lower than domestic prices, is prohibited from gaining an advantage in producing his product at a time when export prices are higher. This highlights one of the areas of deficiency this scheme, the faUure of the Government to realise some of the problems of the processors of wheat and wheat products. In the course of the last few months I have had some discussions with those who are in this category and each has expressed concern at the general impUcations of the provisions that the Government has brought forward and at the Government's faUure to consider the problems of avaUabUity of grain, the avaUabUity of grain of different classes and their abUity to compete in production of gluten or whatever the by-product might be with those who are producing that particular product either from other grains or in particularly advantageous geographic locations. For example, some advantage is given to an exporter of wheat products and a processor of wheat products who is now located in Tasmama. He gains through some of the provisions of this legislation from the equaUsation of wheat prices in that State an advantage over wheat processors on the mainland. The scheme set out in the Wheat Industry StabUization BUl is radically different from previous StabUization schemes. It reflects generally the bias that this Government has against rural industries and which has never been better demonstrated than by the complete faUure of the Government to consider the problems of rural industries in the Budget presented on Tuesday night. Although the Government can claim that this wheat legislation was negotiated with and finally approved by the Australian Wheat growers Federation, there is no doubt in the mind of every wheat grower in Austraha that it was a very unsatisfactory set of negotiations. As recendy as last weekend violent objections were lodged up in Moree in northern New South Wales to the imphcations of this type of legislation which for so many seems to capitahse on the presently advantageous world market conditions but prejudices the long term opportunities for wheat production. I do not think it is unfair to say that the Wheat growers' Federation was bullied and cajoled generaUy with threats of intimidation and references to the Industries Assistance Commission and all sorts of other alternatives to the point where it had no alternative but to accept the proposals put to it by the Australian Government. SimUarly the objections raised by individual States were taken into account only to a minimal degree. It is unfortunate that the process of formulation of pohcy by this Government tends more and more to ignore the wishes of the individual and of the States but pursues a in philosophical bent which in the consequence I am afraid will lead to a marked disadvantage to the whole of our Austrahan community. The Federation, of course, was told to accept this proposal or there would be no StabUization scheme or that the scheme would have to go, if there was to be one at all, to the Industries Assistance Commission. With the traumas that many wheat growers have had over the last few years and with the problems which they now foresee in generally maintaining their profitability most wheat growers believed that they would just have to accept the scheme. It was for that reason and in spite of very real objections by some members of the Federation that the Federation finally accepted the proposals. SimUarly both Labor and non-labor governments expressed their reservations at the Australian Agricultural CouncU about the manner in which the negotiations were carried out and on some aspects of the scheme itself. Many of these governments have approached members of the Opposition suggesting that we should move substantive amendments to the proposals now before us. It is very tempting for those of us who have a genuine interest and concern for producers to do so. But were we to do so, this being 19 September, we would be in a position where it would be impossible for those who are producing wheat and will have it delivered to sUos within the next two or three weeks to know where they were going. Therefore we in the Opposition feel that we are being precluded from moving any substantive changes to this legislation. We are supporting this legislation not because we believe it is good but because of the time factor and the lack of opportunity for us to change the legislation in a way that we believe would be desirable if the wheat growers, consumers and the interests of all Australia were to be taken properly into account. In many ways this scheme is quite inferior earher schemes It reduces the level of protection available to growers that was set out in former schemes. It reduces the level of government involvement in mamtaining the viabUity of productivity. Australia's major dry land farming industry. reduces the future potential of wheat growers to maintain their volume of production in the Ught of growing world food needs if world export prices should take a downturn. It faUs to nise the degree to which grain production is agriculture becoming more and more capital intensive. It faUs to recognise the necessity for the maintenvide ance of major agricultural industries in many of our outlying communities. Beyond aU that it still pursues a single commodity pohcy at a time represents when many other countries-the United States, for example-ar e considering not just one grain but providing an opportunity for farmers to move from one source of production to another according to the potential profitabiUty to the ducer of those crops and giving him the same protection. Let me advert for a moment to an aspect which it had been my intention to discuss with primary producers when we were in government. We were pursuing the idea of giving those who were in wheat production an opportunity to proare duce nulo or any other agricultural crop if crop were to produce for them a better result. wanted to see whether it was not possible to give them the same sort of guarantees as are provided for them in the wheat agreement. For example, many can produce oats, barley or milo. If one in a summer rainfaU area and there is a drought during the winter months it is far better duce milo than to leave the land faUow and duce no grain until the following year. I refer those who might be interested in topic to a piece of legislation which the United States has on its statute book. It is pubhc 93-86 of the 93rd Congress. It was passed on August 1973. It covers not just a wlieat program but a program relating to a range of agricultural industries. The aspect I refer to the House in relaindustry tion to this concern which I have with this lation is that it is designed to attract the farm duction needed to meet domestic and foreign demand for food andfibre.The United States legislation accomplishes this by creating a favourable climate within which farmers respond to market signals which indicate sumer demand and thus produce the crops which are needed at home and abroad. This Act protake place. vides a concept of guaranteed or target prices. It has deficiency payments for a range of commodiIt ties. The deficiency payments are to be related to an average market price. They are related to that average market price remaining above a target level. The Act provides a bonus for individual productivity greater than the overall national In other words, it provides an opIt portunity for producer freedom and market orientated farm poUcy. To my mind this is a basis from which we in Australia might well be able to encourage farm diversification which has been of recogsuch tremendous advantage to Australian in the last few years. This is a form by wbich this legislation could venture out and promore for the farmer than it does now. In fact, this Wheat Industry StabUisation BUl the level of production which is available to growers under former schemes. Not many Austrahans realise that a negotiated home consumption price for wheat under this legislation results in them getting farinaceous food proproducts, such as bread, at much lower prices than the rest of the world's western industrial communities. In other words, our wheat farmers are prepared to accept and are accepting a significantly lower price in order that they can get some stabUity in their income over a period. They are prejudicing the higher prices which they reserve by selling their wheat abroad. They doing this in order to enter into this agreethat ment. Unfortunately, the Government has not We had the decency within the agreement to provide an offset by giving them a fair sort of return. Rather, it has devised a scheme which ignores the cost to the producer, ignores the inflationary is situation which the Government is inciting and ignores the circumstances of industrial disruption to prowhich has prevented the Australian Wheat proBoard and other grain marketing agencies from delivering grain and realising proceeds which otherwise would have been capable of being the paid to producers of grain delivered some years ago. In other words, the wheat industry in a very law significant way is subsidising Austrahan con10 sumers under this legislation. The Labor Party should recognise this when it talks about its hot air war against inflation. It should commend the for its restraint. This year the industry legismost probably will harvest a crop of less than pro400 milhon bushels. It probably will be less than last year's crop. Harvesting this crop, transporting it to sUos and deUvering it from sUos in the bush to major seaport terminals will not be easy, may particularly if this Government completely conneglects the provision of fuel supphes. One wonders whether the harvest wiU even be able to is quite tragic that this Government thinks it to can talk about wheat in one package and forget all about the problems of harvesting wheat, having fuel to harvest the wheat, having fuel ""to. enable the rail trucks to get the wheat to the point of shipment and having men working when the wheat is delivered to the port of shipment. All these things are breaking down and are creating a circumstance in which this wheat stabilisauon scheme could be completely frustrated. Harvesting this year's crop, transporting it to silos and shipping it could well be completely impossible under the farcical arrangements that this Government is pursuing with respect to fuel supplies, particularly in northern New South Wales and Queensland.",87
330,Mr LUSHER ,Spar e parts.,91
331,Mr SINCLAIR,"Yes , getting spare parts agricultural machinery is another problem area. There are so many problem areas that the farmer will hnd it almost impossible to subsidise the Australian consumer as this legislation requires him to do. If this Government maintains its abrogation of its responsibilities for maintaintogether ing peaceful industrial relations there is Utde prospect for the future survival of the wheat industry. At the dockside level there is a ridiculous ation. The waterfront unions are refusing to handle ships under contract. They are dictating the nation's foreign affairs pohcies and refusing to load Greek flag vessels with wheat. Previous bans on Chilean ships have meant that the Wheat Board's shipping program is running behind schedule, causing income iiow shortages to the wheat industry. These shortages resulted in the Wheat Board not being able to pay promised 20c per bushel on dehveries from last year's crop. The payment of that 20c per bushel would have meant a better Uquidity situation wheat growers and would have helped to reheve the Uquidity position of the banks. Moreover, this occurred after an announcement by the Wheat Board last AprU setting out the dates on which funds would be avaUable as a result of sales that were made. It was known that ships were coming in. The only reason the payments motives. were not made is that this Government has not been bothered about getting the men to work and getting the cargo moving in the way a reation sponsible government would have done. There are other ways in which this Governplace ment could have helped. If, in the last had not been able to get the ships moving, get the grain moved and get the fuel so that the New South Wales RaUways were able to move the grain from the internal granaries to the ports, could at least have considered the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank and perhaps arranged to make a payment through it so that wheat growers could have received the 20c per bushel that had been promised to them. Indeed, the borrowings from the Rural Credit Department were at their lowest level for several years. The Board, of course, had exceUent prospects of repaying the money within a very short time, but the Government was not prepared to come to the party. One of the amendments that I understand we are to consider later tonight is to enable this legislation to go through with an accelerated passage so that money can be borrowed commerciaUy. That might be a way around the problem, but it is no answer in respect of the Government not having provided that which is for already avaUable- a loan through the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank. The wheat Minister for Northern Development, who represents the Minister for Agriculture in this place, on many occasions, has argued the need for rural credit. He was a party, I suspect, with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to a decision to deny credit which could have been easUy and properly repaid. There is another aspect of the BUl which is situeven more concerning. This Government supposedly is concerned with social justice-socia l justice to everybody other than the producers of this world. In the wheat industry it has preserved one particular inequity, which is quite incredible. In the formulation of this scheme the Governwell ment has decided that the cost of an owneroperator's allowance for labour should be that of a leading hand under the Pastoral Award of a 1968. The award then was $3,181 per annum. It is now about 70 per cent higher than that. In other words, the wheat growers of Austraha are for being caUed on to produce wheat and to subsidise the Australian consumer, yet they are being forced to work at a labour cost imputed on the growing of that wheat at a wage rate which was relevant to the economic climate of 1968. If that is social justice, goodness only knows how the Australian Labor Party interprets any of its There has been some suggestion that this situmay be reviewed in 1975. I trust that the Minister for Northern Development who represents the Minister for Agriculture in this will give us an assurance that it will be resort, it reviewed as soon as possible. Mr Fisher-He is not even here.",91
332,Mr SINCLAIR,"Correct ; he is not even in the it chamber. There is another question that concerns me. It is the question of mid-term repayments. Under this scheme, all the growers' contributions to the stabilisauon fund are utilised before the Government is called on to make a contribution. However, if a deficit builds up in ment. terms of the Government's contributions, payments by the growers to the central funds must be paid to the Government. I find this most inequitable and against any principle of stabilisning ation. Stabilisation is a two-way agreement, one-way agreement. The wheat industry has to take its risks and the Government, if it is to alistic in providing a stabilisation scheme, must also take its share of risks. The arrangement in relation to the mid-term repayments is against the spirit of stabUisation. Of course, in the short to medium term, the oudook for the Austrahan wheat industry on international markets is lent. The only factor limiting this oudook is domestic economic management of this nation. Wheat growers, Uke all producers, are in the hands of inflation. Rising production costs, shortco-operation ages and so on, caused to a large degree by this Government's faUure to restrain innation tolerable level, are adversely affecting the profitability of the wheat industry. In many rural industries, many producers are operating negative profitabUity because of the rigours inflation. Although the consumer price index dicates an inflation level of 16.4 per cent, it considerably higher in many agricultural indus Mr tries. For example, the assessment of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics produced before the Prices Justification Tribunal inquiry into the dairy industry was 24 per cent a year cost tion. In the wheat industry, it is considerably higher. The Opposition is concerned with the imphcaAustralia tions of this BUl. It accepts that it is necessary it is horrified at the manner in which it was tiated and beUeves that it is necessary that House take note of the Opposition's amendment. Therefore, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a inserting the following words in place thereof: 'whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill this (1) expresses its concern at the arbitrary nature cussions with the Australian Wheat Federation Agricultural Council on details of the new stabilisation proposals, and (2) because yond the control of the industry, deplores the ment's failure to take the acuon necessary pool payments foreshadowed for the 1973-74 made to growers.' We beheve that the Government has neglected that its responsibUities to the wheat industry. It is only Bill. in the circumstances of lack oftimein spite of the duress of the original negotiations that the position accepts this BUl, subject to the ment that I have now moved.",91
333,Mr SPEAKER,"Is the amendment seconded? Mr King- Mr Speaker, I second the amendMONICA",92
334,Mr WHAN ,"Eden-Monaro) (8.34)-The BUls now under consideration provide for a new wheat stabUisation plan for the 5 seasons begin1 October 1974. Subject to complementary not a legislation being enacted by the States, the present proposals wiU also provide for the conbe re-tinuing operation of the Austrahan Wheat Board for 2 seasons beyond the duration of the stabUisation plan in order to provide continuity in wheat marketing. Negotiations on the new scheme were conducted by the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Wriedt, with the executive of the Ausexceltrahan Wheat Growers Federation. Unlike the the previous speaker the honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair), I state that these negotiations were conducted in an atmosphere of and in a genuine attempt to arrive at a solution to a problem which has beset the at a wheat industry for many years. other When the negotiations were concluded sucat cessfuUy with the Federation on 8 March, the of President of the Australian Wheat Growers Fedineration, Mr Max Ridd, stated publicly that he is was satisfied with the results of the negotiations. Max Ridd, as we have heard here this evening, was supposed to under some sort of duress. Certainly, he would not have been restrained in his comments if that had in fact been the case. inflaThe delays that were caused on that occasion were due purely and simply to the pig-headedness of Liberal and Country Party State governments. The State Labor Government of Western had accepted the proposals. At the subbutsequent State election, a new Liberal Governnegoment was elected. That Government rejected the the scheme. But, of course, that Government could not be outdone by the greatest obstructionist in the Australian States, Sir Robert Askin, who view to went to the polls and was elected on a mandate to obstruct any action by the Federal GovernHouse ment, regardless of whether it was beneficial. Sir of disRobert Askin stepped in and reneged on those and arrangements. His Government reneged on the commitments that it had given to the wheat of industrial disruption beGovernindustry. What is more, these actions by the State to enable Governments of Western Australia and of New crop to be South Wales were condemned at thetimeby the wheat industry. It was this sort of obstructionism led to the major delay in the initiation of this OpThe scheme itself is a determined and almost amendunique attempt to overcome a problem which was inherent in the previous schemes. This was the confrontation between the prices and costs of production of wheat on the one hand and, on the other hand, world prices which had no relationship or relativity at all to the costs of production in Austraha. These 2 conflicting issues have been resolved for the first time in what is indeed a unique scheme. The variations in wheat prices on the international market are a fact of hfe and so, too, is the escalation in costs of duction. We had all sorts of convolutions taking place under the previous Government. The wheat industry does not need to be reminded of the sequence of events leading up to the end of 1969 when the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in a quite summary way imposed quotas on the wheat industry at a time when many of the wheat growers had wheat in the ground. It is far better to give the wheat industry some sort of notice of what income its producers are likely to receive many years ahead and to cushion the income of wheat growers against the shocks of the international market. That is in fact what this scheme achieves. That is far better than a pohcy of imposing quotas in a mandatory way out of the blue on wheat growers when they have their seed in the ground, as happened under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in 1969. Thefirstelement of this scheme is afixeddomestic price for wheat to be adjusted annually from the level of the 1973-74 season and to be carried out by index methods through the Ufe of the scheme. The second element is a stabilisation price covering all export wheat. Under the previous scheme, the guaranteed price covered only 200 milhon bushels. That was another of the limitations built into the scheme under the Liberal-Country Party Government. The present scheme covers all export wheat. This is clearly a major revolution in the protection of the wheat industry. In common with the Australian Wheat growers Federation's proposals submitted to the Government last September, the major objective of the scheme is to give the wheat industry some security against price fluctuations without distorting the underlying trend in market prices and to keep the cost to the Austrahan pubUc within definite hmits. The proposals from the Australian Wheat growers Federation have been accepted in this new and unique scheme which moderates the impact of fluctuating prices on the international market. The scheme continues the orderly marketing arrangements through the Australian Wheat Board which the industry has enjoyed since the first post-war stabUisation scheme commenced under a Labor Government in 1948. Once again we see a Labor Government introducing the first major innovation for the protection of the wheat industry against fluctuating incomes. The arrangements under which the Government guarantees borrowings from the Reserve Bank by the Australian Wheat Board will continue. These arrangements have enabled the Board to pro- maintain the first advance payment over the years even when average returns have fallen to lower levels. With reference tofirstadvance payments, immediately on taking office, this Government agreed to demands which had been refused by the previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for New England, who was then Minister for Primary Industry. Those demands were to increase the first advance payment by 10c to $1.20 a bushel. This action must be contrasted in the wheat grower's mind with the attitude of the honourable member for New England when, in October 1972, as Minister for Primary Industry, he point blank refused to increase thefirstadvance payment by 10c. Mr MCVeigh-You put the interest rate up by 6 per cent.",92
335,Mr WHAN,We have now struck the chord. We hear the Country PartyMr MCVeigh-What rubbish.,93

337,Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable member for Darling Downs will remain sUent. I wiU insist that the honourable member for Eden Monaro receive the same courtesy as did the Deputy Leader of the Country Party whUe he makes his contribution.,93
338,Mr WHAN,"Mr Speaker, I thank you for your protection from the kindergarten behaviour on myright.The reaction was due simply to 2 undeniable facts: On taking office this Government raised the lint advance by 10c a bushel, while in October 1972 the Liberal-Country Party Government, in which the honourable member for New England was the Minister for Primary Industry, refused point blank to do this. There is no argument about that. That is a statement of the position as it existed and as it was known by every wheat grower in the industry. The stabUisation price for the year 1974-75 will be set at $2 a bushel-considerabl y more than the guaranteed $1.60 a bushel which apphed in 1973-74. The stabUisation price will be adjusted in each of the succeeding 4 years by the application of the formula which was agreed to by the industry the Government. The formula will move stabiliEngland sation prices in line with market trends and particular will cushion sharp declines in overseas market values. This, of course, is one of unique features of this scheme, this shock absorber system which has been built into it. With grower returns linked more closely to theprices market place a more economic allocation of resources will be encouraged within the wheat industry and the rural sector generally, go a long way towards providing that flexibility that the honourable member for New England appealed for in terms of alternative uses farm. Under past schemes there guaranteed price which moved in line with changes in assessed costs of production. This posal is a major revolution in the protection wheat growers' incomes against fluctuating prices. The honourable member for New England said that the present agreement ignores the costs of production and gives reduced protec-Government tion to growers. Let me quote from a speech made in this House on 10 October 1968 by the present Leader of the Country Party ( Mr designed Anthony). In that speech he said that the simand plest explanation for the need for change in cost formula- I refer here to the cost of prowool, duction index-wa s that in IS consecutive average returns to growers had been less the assessed cost of production, yet the industry had expanded at an unprecedented rate. He thenstUl said: It is demonstrably prosperous. There can be no doubt the returns from wheat marketed have been remunerative. This was the present Leader of the Country Partymdustry saying that the cost of production index had been obviously out of kilter with the facts of Ufe. here we have the sort of criticism that he then answering being leveUed at the Governcommitments ment by the honourable member for New England. In the 1973-74 season, as I have tioned already, the Government raised the first advance by 10c a bushel. It was a clear responseavaUable from a concerned Government to the conditions that existed in the wheat industry and a responseto to the need that existed in the wheat industry that time. There can be no question that this Governcate ment has done more for the agricultural sector than any government in the last 23 years. In fell swoop it has given to the agricultural sector,as including wheat growers many of whom run the sheep, afixedreserve price. Look at the saga existed on the Opposition benches over that issue. The scheme was bankroUed by SISOm of Government monev. I return to another point andmade by the honourable member for New ( Mr Sinclair). He complained that in wheat harvesting in New South Wales and in Austraha generaUy will be curtaUed by fuel the shortages. Imagine what would have happened if by some disaster he and his colleagues had been elected to government. Those wheat farmers would now be paying extraordinary for the petrol used in harvesting, simply because the oU companies of the world had them and it willunder their thumbs.

345,Mr HYDE,"I still make the point that under our Government a far higher proportion of money received was paid as the first advance. Itquite is not the wish of the Opposition to delay this It should not be delayed at this time. But does not mean that we are happy with it. We are most unhappy with it. The industry does not wishbut to see it delayed. That does not mean that industry is happy with it. The industry is most happy with it. We have seen a radical change principles. Let me quote from the second readingproducers. speech of the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) who represents the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt). Incidentally, he has not bothered to remain to hear the debate. He said: . . . the Oovernment concluded that there should major revision of the existing stabilisation arrangements. particular, wethat is, the Governmentreached the position that the provision of a guaranteed for a specific quantity of exports, with the price adjusted according to certain cost movements from year to year, was not conducive to maximum efficiency in the wheat industry. That may be so. He also said that these the proposalsare to give the industry some security against price tion without distorting the underlying trend in market The proposed scheme distorts the underlying trend in market prices and gives very Uttle tection against price downturns. This industry produces its product in an environment where are boosted by the tariff waU and by induspoUcies of the Government, and are abetted by the Government. It has been argued, and reasonably argued, in the past that a high home toconsumption price-that is, high in reladon to the pre-world price with tariff compensation-wa s the thing that brought the market forces back into I thought balance and back into play. Incidentally, were theretimeto refer the matter to the Industries Assistance Commission-obviously there is not- I wouldfindit very hard to beUeve that the industry could suffer from any by that Commission. In fact I beheve its the submissions would stand up very well indeed. a pricing formula used will result in the wheat being used to subsidise the home marand to subsidise it heavUy. This policy will be in that it wiU both reduce costs and reduce money in growers' pockets. Even to that of course,extent it might be deflationary.",95

It might even be considered sound if the industry were offered anytliing Bill.reasonable, but it is offered nothing in return. that The home consumption price should not move up and down with every shift in market forces, it should reflect likely long term trends and in the adverse times it should cushion violent downun-turns in the market that would disrupt the indusoftry and bring hardship to even the most efiicient The home consumption price is to be adjusted by annual reference to costs except that the allowance for the grower's return-hi s basic wage, as it were-is fixed according to 1968 values. In these times of spiralling wages and prices why be asingle out wheat growers to stand still in money Interms and to fall back very rapidly in real terms? There is currendy around 86 mUlion bushels of wheat used within Australia. Exports should priceyield in excess of $2.73 a bushel with a probbeing abUity of $3 a bushel. The 86 million bushels sold to the home market at 75c less than export E rices represents an annual contribution to the ome market of $64m or $320m over the life of agreement. For anyone to argue that escalating costs will force up the home consumption fluctua-price as we live with inflation and so reduce the prices.margin between the home consumption price and the export price, is to say that this Govemproment is going to allow a situation in which our rate of inflation will inevitably be higher than that of our trading partners. Heaven help us, for that will destroy the export market. In return for this contribution the Australian wheat grower is offered stabilisation-o r equalisation-bu t at what level? In the event of a drastic slump the growers' price is to be stabilized from a fund of $80m to which he himself has been contributing. How much will he have been contributing? The growers will have contributed $48m now and in all probability, the whole $80m-wit h nearly the remainder going in this season. We can forecast with reasonable expectation that prices will be more than 1 Sc above the stabilization price for at least the first 2 years. Every contribution of the Government to this fund will be repaid in the event of grower contributions later placing moneys back into the fund. So, it is almost impossible to envisage a situation where the Government would be involved in any loss whatsoever. Nevertheless, let us consider the most costly but still unlikely posiuon in which the Government might find itself. That is, growers contribute-as they certainly will-$48 m in the first year and $30m in the next year and the remaining $2m in the third year. If the wheat market collapses completely the Government pays out $30m in each of the remaining 3 years-in the most unhkely event of a prolonged and unpredicted slump. Even in those conditions the Government would have to find a mere $10m. The export price would need to fall to most unlikely low levels for the home consumption price to return the $128m subsidy that the wheat grower is providing to the home market in the first 2 years. In fact, the Government is using the wheat industry in an anti-inflationary policy and offering it nothing in return. Let me come to the accusations of obstruction by the State governments. Let us look at the position in Western Austraha in particular and at why the Court Government was so reluctant to accept these provisions. First of all, in Western Australia we have produced 29 per cent of the wheat and we have 22 per cent of the quota. We have no great incentive to stay with this scheme. We have the greatest potential to expand our wheat production and to bring further land under wheat. Yet, the quota was frozen. We have a freight advantage that has never been adequately recognised. We have no border over which we can trans-ship wheat and so avoid the provisions of the quota and the restrictions imposed. If honourable members consider that is a small matter I ask them to consider that when world prices rose and it no longer paid to sell wheat outside the system wheat for home consumption purchased from the Board jumped by 26 million bushels. A lot of wheat was being sold outside the system. Western Austraha was not in that. There was no opportunity. Not that I believe that any grower ought to have been in it. Because Western Austraha has a low home consumption and a high export, when we are faced with an inequitable scheme such as thisinequitable between the consumers and the producers Australia, perforce, makes a much greater contribution to the inequity. Western Australia had every reason to be very chary about this wheat scheme, and hence the stand of the Court Government. I wish to say something about wheat quality and payment for quality. For too long the industry has been offered nofinancialincentive to produce quality wheat. It is too often confused with the argument of segregation and the admitted difficulties of segregating a vast number of wheat varieties. It is sufficient that the wheat growers be paid for producing quality, and all that is necessary to conduct the machinery of this exercise is that sufficient sampling be done so that each grower can be rewarded for producing something better than the minimum standards-stan dards, incidentally, that have to be set so that most growers can meet them. If we again go into times when wheat is difficult to sell we will regret not having done our level best to produce the best wheat within Australia. Finally, I summarise my remarks about the scheme itself. Growers contribute much-$64 m a year-and they get little. In all probability they will get nothing. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (9.1)- I was very surprised to hear the Deputy Leader of the Country Party, the honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair), blame the Government for the delay in the introduction of these wheat Bills. The Opposition seems to have a great capacity to cause delay and to blame it on the Government. The delay in the introduction of these Bills was caused by the Senate's refusing to introduce measures that were approved by the people at the May elections. Not only did the Senate refuse to endorse the measures; it even went as far as going into court in an effort to prevent the Government from holding the Joint Sitting of the Parliament. It is a lot of rot to say that the Government is holding up its own legislation. I do not think any of the electors will be fooled by this type of propaganda. The honourable member for New England was critical of the fact that there has been some delay in the export of wheat because of an industrial dispute. Does he forget that there was an even longer delay when the Opposition was in government? At that time we had no overseas markets to supply. It was not until this Government went out and obtained markets that we had any opportunity to export wheat. The honourable member for Moore ( Mr Hyde) has mentioned the Tariff Board. It seems to be a strange thing that the Opposition parties want to remind the people of what happened with tariffs during the 23 years that they were in government. The wheat growers were concerned about tariffs. They asked our predecessors to remove them, but it was not until the Labor Party came into power that there was a 25 per cent reduction in tariffs. I support the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill because I beheve that, together with the Wheat Products Export Adjustment Bill and the Wheat Export Charge Bill, it will introduce a stabUisation plan in respect of the 5 growing seasons starting on 1 October 1974.1 believe tiiat this is very desirable proposition. It will remove much of the uncertainty in the minds of wheat growers and will aUow them to plan their production over a long period. This will result in better planning and therefore a greater nnanciai return to the industry. These measures should meet with the approval of the industry. When introducing these BUls the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) told us that they had been accepted by the industry organisations. So they should be, because their basic aim is to bring security against price fluctuations. The legislation sets out to do this without any undue interference with market prices. I want to point out here that I do not intend the inference to be taken that there should never be any interference with market prices. I am reminded of what happened with the wool markets. If there had not been some interference with those markets many wool growers would be out of production today. I do not think that interference is quite as necessunder ary in regard to wheat because the Australian Wheat Board is the sole marketing authority and has control over aU wheat marketed in Australia as well as the wheat and wheat products exported from Australia. I agree with the provision that the Australian Wheat Board is to have power for two seasons beyond the duration of this stabUisation scheme because to grow and market wheat is no small operation. Big things, of necessity, should gain momentum slowly and, of course, they should be run down slowly. These measures bring in a stabUisation on price related to movement in the international wheat market. I am in favour of this because I beheve that no responsible governThe ment should introduce a scheme which is not related to either the requirements of an international market or to home consumption. If this were not so our valuable resources could be wasted and excess wheat could be produced, although I am prepared to admit that this is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. This scheme provides for abandonment of the concept of a guaranteed price and replaces it with a stabUisation price related to movements in the international wheat market. The grower will know in advance what his return will be and will know that it will not be below a certainfigure.As a matter of fact, the 1974-75 price will be $73.49 per tonne f.o.b., or, as stated already, $2 per bushel. This is an advance on the present legislation because it does not contain this provision. It appUes, of course, to aU wheat exported. Honourable members should compare this scheme with the present legislation and the dried a vine fruits stabilisation legislation. The scheme for dried vine fruits contained a tonnage limitation but no Umitation appUed to new plantings and this forced many growers off their land. This wheat stabUisation scheme wiU provide security not only for those directly involved in growing wheat but also for those indirecdy involved. It is only just that in a time of buoyant prices the industry should make some contribution to the cost of the scheme. Regardless of this the Government is guaranteeing the scheme to the extent of $80m over 5 years. Any government contribution not recouped before the end of the 5 year period wiU be written off. The Minister has explained already that this provision is not contained in the BUl but he mentioned it in this House for the record. In addition the grower is to pay no contribution if the average export price is below $55.12 per tonne, or $1.50 per bushel, and he will receive a contribution from the fund the formula set out in clause 29 (5) of the BUl. Also, he will receive a distribution when the fund is in credit in excess of $80m. The inclusion of clauses 21 (6) and 23 (1) (b) will close a lot of loopholes that exist in the present legislation. All honourable members remember the period when we had the across-the-border black market in wheat. Today we heard a lot about slush funds of the deep sea saUors. I am not saying that the same thing applies in regard to black marketing in over-the-border wheat, but I point out that a lot of this black marketing was going on and it put many wheat growers off the land. The previous Government was in a position to do something about it but faUed to do it. provision to include 10 growers' representatives on the Board has been retained. I believe that is to the credit of the Government. The legislation is being amended to give one home consumption price. I believe that here again another loophole in the present legislation has been blocked off, because there is no doubt that nonhuman consumption wheat has been finding its way into markets to which it should not have found its way. Having a good general standard of wheat throughout is a much better idea. I hope that the Opposition will not delay the passing of these Bills, because already there are restrictions on expanding the world food than 50 per cent. suppUes. The traditional approach to increasing production by expanding the area under cultivation can no longer apply or has hmited scope for the future. This is because densely populated countries like Japan and the countries of western Europe no longer have land avaUable for production. Added to this, most of the rivers lend themselves to damming and irrigation already been developed. We have yet to learn what impact the energy crisis will have on production. It could well mean that energy may cause farmers engaged in high energy conquotas. suming agriculture, such as that in practice Umted States of America, to hold down pronot duction. I beheve we have a duty to create a global food reserve to provide a measure of world price stabUity. I think that in the long run this be in the self interest of all nations. I commend the BUls to the House.",95
348,Mr KING ,"Wimmera) (9.13)-Being a very charitable type, I commence my remarks by sayin ing that the 2 Government speakers this evening made the very best with very poor material. honourable member for Darling ( Mr prices FitzPatrick) commenced his speech by claiming great credit for securing export sales of wheat. Mr FitzPatrick-We did.",98
349,Mr KING,"He went very close to it. He ticised the previous government not find markets overseas, but today we have them. Therefore, if that is not claiming credit I do not know what is. But the honourable member not prepared to teU us about the lack of demand today for wool and meat. If he is to take credit one issue, please let him take what goes with other. The honourable member for Edenthan Monaro ( Mr Whan) gave us a very interesting address too. He talked about the many things the wheat stabUisation scheme of which he was proud. He said he was proud of the fact that would cover aU the wheat that was grown Australia, but he did not say by how much. talked about this legislation as a major innovawithin tion. He talked about thefirstadvance on wheat, but he did not teU us what sort of interest rates the wheat mdustry pays today. He did not remind us of the percentage that the present Government is paying on the first advance, as the honourable member for Moore ( Mr Hyde) reminded him of the percentage being paid under this scheme as compared with what was paid by the previous Government. The previous Government paid a first advance averaged over 5 years, of more than 80 per cent of the final payment to wheat growers. In the first year of this new plan the first advance is expected to be less Mr MCVeigh-Onl y 50 per cent?",98
350,Mr KING,"Only 50 per cent. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro made great play crop about the satisfaction of the Australian that Wheat growers Federation with this plan. The have Deputy Leader of the Country Party ( Mr Sinclair) made it very clear that the Federation food accepted the plan rather reluctantly. The cost honourable member for Eden-Monaro criticised This again is the suggestion of the Ausin the tralian Wheat growers Federation. Why did he praise the Federation on that point, too ? The difference between this plan and the previous plan, on the surface, appears insignificant; will but on a close scrutiny one will find a very big difference. It removes the guaranteed price and substitutes what I caU a cushioning price. The returns to growers will tend to follow the market both up and down. When the market is down we this Party are very concerned on behalf of the wheat industry. The issues in this BUl appear The minor today, but when times are tough and are low these minor items could well be major issues which would have adverse effects on the return to growers. The reason I say this is simply that at present the reduced quantity of wheat throughot the world has tended to lift the criprice considerably. Government members take because it could credit for this fact. If one compares this increased price and the is general cost of production today with the position some years ago, one will agree that at on present the price is not excessive. I ask: What the article can be purchased today for afigureless double that of a few years ago? If it were just profitable 10 or 15 years ago, my guess is in that it is no more profitable today. The only advantage is that wheat growers have increased it their productivity more than have the growers in in any other industry of which I know. Previous He plans had a Umited amount of wheat which came the export guarantee, but the amount of the guarantee per bushel was unhmited. It was limited in quantity, but the finance was unlimited. Today in this proposal the quantity is unUmited but the amount of money is restricted. The postion is the reverse. Yet the Government is proud of this position. It means that there is a maximum of $30m a year. If $30m is spread over a crop for sale of $300m, it is only 10c a bushel, whereas previously the quantity was Umited to 200 milhon bushels. But it could, if the price feU to a low level, mean even so much more in total as well as in the amount per bushel. For the 1967-68 pool the then Government paid out $42,869,000, and in respect of the year 1971-72 it paid out $40,131,000. I point out, however, that it is not the totalfigurethat is so imponant but the guarantee in the event of the price falling below a reasonablefigure.To my mind, that is the most imponant point to remember in relation to any plan. It is obvious that this plan, spread over 5 years, will be successful because,firstof all, the growers have contributed $48m up to this time, before the actual scheme commences. There is $48m in the fund now. Because of the present ruling price it is expected that they will contribute a maximum of $30m this year. It is hardly Ukely, because of the present world shortage and the fact that the surplus accounts for only 22 million tons as compared with approximately SO million tons average over the last 10 years, that the price of the next harvest wiU fall below the minimum price at which growers are required to contribute. In theory the growers will have in the fund $78m, or maybe $80m. Under Part IV, clauses 30, sub-clause (S), the amount to be paid out in any one year is Umited to $30m. That being the case, irrespective of what the price may be that $80m must faU short by only $10m to cover growers for the remaining 3 years if the overseas price falls below the guaranteed price, which means in turn that the total commitment by the Commonwealth Government would be only $10m over a S-years plan. That is how good this plan is. That is $2m a year. I almost use up that amount in my own electorate, let alone my own farm. So whUe it may appear to be afinegesture by the Government to return any unused funds to the growers after the plan expires in 1979 it has really given back nothing because if the price drops to a minimum low for 3 years its total payout will be, I repeat, only $10m. If the price remains on a reasonable level the Government contributes nothing but makes a fine gesture by returning the growers' money to them. We are going to give them back their own money. In other words that is the only contribution the Government will make. So much for the 5-year period. If this plan is carried through in its entirety for the next 5 years and the export price runs out at below the guarantee, then the maximum contribution by the Government could not be above $30m a year or $80m over 5 years, which is the maximum the Government is expected to contribute in accordance with this BUl. It could well be said that this is afinecontribution. But it should be remembered that it is over a 10-year period, which would average out at $9m a year, during which time growers could well make a very large contribution to the supplying of cheap wheat for consumption in Australia, as was expounded by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party earlier this evening. Their contribution to the supplying of cheap wheat is estimated at approximately $107m this year. That is on present day prices. The Government's contribution will be a total of $90m over 10 years. That is how unbalanced this plan is. If the price remains high for 10 years the growers' contribution could well be about $ 100,000m plus. In return they would receive a guarantee, as I have said, of $80m of the taxpayers' money. But if the price remained high the Government would contribute nothing. All I can say to those people who suggest that this is a magnificent plan which will assist the wheat growing industry is that it is not. It is far from it. The growers will in the main contribute a lot more to the economy than they will receive in return. If inflation continues torisein Austraha at the present level and production costs continue to increase we could well see a situation by the time the plan expires in 5 years from now in which the value of their contribution of $30m will be minimised to the extent that it will be meaningless as far as a wheat stabUisation plan is concerned. Perhaps I should explain that by pointing out that if by chance costs double in 5 years or even 10 years the present $30m will be equivalent to about $ 15m on today's level, which makes the whole exercise of litde value. It has been said that the industry and the State governments have accepted this proposal. That is true. But I joir with the Deputy Leader of the Country Party in saying that they have done so very reluctantly. They had no alternative. It was a case of take it or leave it. The Government could not estabUsh a 5-year plan in 10 months. It had to take 2 years to introduce it. The industry certainly put up a goodfight.It obtained a few concessions, but it is really not very happy about the overall situation. Anyone on the Government side of the chamber who disagrees with me in that respect ought to go out and talk with the industry about the matter. Honourable members opposite should talk with the individual wheat growers and see what they think. To my mind too much has been made of 2 other issues, namely, the removal of quotas and the first advance. The first advance really means nothing because it is drawing upon the borrowing from the Reserve Bank, which must be repaid with interest. So the higher thefirstadvance the longer the delay in the second advance and, naturally, the more the interest which will have to be repaid. I should add that the present rate of interest is somewhere about 60 per cent above the previous range obtained by the former Government. As regards the question of quotas, according clause 25 of the Bill this is only a postponement on delivery while growers cannot supply the full amount of wheat. I do not disagree with this, let it not be said that quotas are gone for all time-despit e today's announcement that the Austrahan Wheat growers Federation has deGovernment cided against quotas and has removed them for the time being. As soon as delivery reaches figure that will use up the agreed upon loan the Reserve Bank, no doubt quotas will be introduced, even under this Government. I make no apology for saying that. This ceptable because the wheat industry has no troubles at the presenttime.But if we return to a period when the world price for wheat is low, this plan will be of little value to the wheat industry. I wish to place a few of these things on record wUlaccept because I beheve that the time will come when that be people will regret that they wheat stabilisation plan. Many things have hapthroughout the naturally pened since this legislation was introduced by Leader of the Australian the Minister for Northern Development Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patteraccept this legislation but that the son). The Australian Wheat Board has not able to honour its earher announcement to the will not read the proposed amendmentofagain. effect that in August it would pay 20c a bushel the 1973-74 wheat harvest. I am not critical the Board for making that announcement. I heve that the Chairman of the Board may have this been premature in making the announcement, again. but I think that he did it under pressure. I think wheat growers that he did it in the interests order to give people the opportunity to budget Federation to get athe and also to give to those people who wanted to fore something very borrow money some confidence as to when they Therefore, I beheve that could expect to receive some money. But because House, being from 2 responsible of industrial unrest this payment of 20c a bushel alternative but to support the amendment was not forthcoming. So we have had to wait. The Bill also includes a new provision in 36(2). This sub-clause gives Wheat Board authority to borrow from sources outside the normal channels of the rural credits division of the Reserve Bank. I will be quite frank about this: I do not like this sub-clause. Ever since there has been a wheat stabUisation plan we have always borrowed our money from the Reserve Bank. Why should we go outside the bank now? WUl we find that because we have created the precedent of borrowing from outside the Reserve Bank, on some future occasion when the chips are a bit short somewhere the wheat industry will be encouraged to go outside the Reserve Bank and to borrow privately? Honourable members who have read today's newspapers will know that the Australian Wool Corporation appUed to the private trading banks to for some funds to keep the new wool plan financiaUy sound. But what happened today? The request for funds was rejected by the private but trading banks. Now I understand that the Government is to caU a special Cabinet meeting to consider introducing legislation to enable the to provide the necessary funds. I do not know the finer detaUs of the proposal, but a that is what is proposed in principle. We could from find ourselves in the position where the wheat industry would be expected to go to private enterprise to borrow money to meet the first adlegislation is acvance payments. I support the broad principles of a wheat stabUisation plan. I realise that we are cornered and that we have no alternative. We either this plan or we reject it. If we reject it there were no plan at all for the coming season. If the case, in the presentfinancialsituhave accepted this ation I would see chaos occurring wheat industry. The Deputy Country Party has and moved an amendment along we lines that we do so under a been form of protest. In view of the shortness timeI on Most honourable members recaU the Deputy of Leader of the Country Party reading it.

351,Mr MCVEIGH ,"Darling Downs) (9.31)-In and supporting the amendment moved by the trahan Deputy Leader of the Austrahan Country Party, the honourable member for New England ( Mr Are Sinclair), I want firsdy to congratulate the honourable member for Darling ( Mr FitzPathat trick) on his humane approach to a world wide problem. Whilst congratulating him and endorsLeader's ing the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera ( Mr King) I severely castigate the other speaker, the honourable member for Edenareas Monaro ( Mr Whan) who, when the industry and the Austrahan people were looking for flour bake, gave them only candy floss, which, like promises, merely melts away. During these bates on the wheat industry we of will expose the rural policy myth of the Austrahan Labor Party by giving the facts and tellmagnificent ing the truth about its aims and thrusts. look at the full canvas, as it were, and analyse it. ity of hfe; secondly, the necessity We will not accept as sufficient a cursory examin-index purposes the owner-operators' ation of a few features. During the last few years, from 12 April till now, we have seen the price of a 2 lb loaf bread in Sydney increase from 23c to 35c, with prophesy it will be increased by another 2c per loaf in the very near future. In the baking induswe try there have been the following increases in costs in the last 14 months: Labour, 55 per cent; inputs other than flour, 12 per cent; interest charges, 10 per cent plus another astronomical flat 2 per cent recently; sundries, 8 per cent; paper costs, 5 per cent; payroll tax, 3 per cent; petrol excise, 1 per cent; andflourcosts, cent. We have the premise established that the price offlourhas increased by 5 per cent due largely to milling cost increases, whilst the of wheat to the trade has increased only marreaucratic ginally. It is rather a chaotic environment and a very coming sad reflection on the Labor Government's monused etary pohcy when increases in inputs other than To the main substance, wheat, have been more than twice as important in determining the price of able bread, and increased paper important.

They cannot seem to realise they performed dismally in rural areas on 18 May. Are they still blinded and drunk from thenpungent comment: 'You have never had it so good'? We will not let them forget that. There is a new rhythm of concern in the rural and they can be assured of prickly disputes from this side of the House. As the honourable to member for Wimmera said, the honourable hismember for Eden-Monaro agrees with the Prime deMinister ( Mr Whidam) that the farmers have the Opposition never had it so good.

354,Mr MCVEIGH,"As the honourable member for Moreton says, shame on anyone, any scribe, any prophet of doom who tries to imply that the Austrahan consumer has been subsidising the Austrahan farmer. I hope that once and for all that nails that vicious he and that it shall never raise its head again. Of course, we have also had the feather bedding of inefficient industries through high tariffs which have penalised the rural sector. Once and for all, I hope that we have silenced those disciples of untruth and apostles of destructive criticism. The Minister, of course, has not given us in his speech the details we are looking for. But we of the Opposiuon do not need a north Austrahan catde dog to yard him-h e is easily yarded as was proved on 18 May. The assessed price structure for wheat for 1974-75 is $1.91.7c per bushel and the home consumpuon price for 1974-75 will be obtained by indexing this price forward according to movements in cash cost and rail freight ON CONSUMER PRICE INDICES FOR THE YEARS 1945-46-1972-73 (All Capital Cities Index) 'C Series Retail Price Consumer Price Amalgamated % Multiplier Index Index Index Index to convert to (1952/53 = 100 (1966/67=100 (1952/53=100) 1972/73 values 49.1 264.8 51.1 250.5 55.4 223.3 60.9 60.9 194.1 66.0 66.0 171.4 74.6 74.6 140.1 91.4 91.4 96.0 100.0 100.0 79.1 102.0 102.0 75.6 102.6 102.6 74.6 106.9 106.9 67.5 113.1 113.1 58.4 114.2 114.2 56.8 116.0 116.0 54.4 118.9 118.9 50.6 123.8 123.8 44.7 124.3 124.3 44.1 124.5 124.5 43.9 125.7 125.7 42.5 130.4 130.4 37.3 135.2 135.2 32.5 138.8 100.0 138.8 29.0 103.3 143.4 24.9 106.0 146.2 22.5 109.4 150.9 18.7 114.6 158.1 13.3 122.4 168.9 6.0 129.8 179.1 and handhng costs, and adding a loading to cover the cost of exporting wheat to Tasmama. These cash costs which will be declared in October next, consist of labour, contracts, electricity, petroleum products, fertiliser, seed, repairs, cornsacks and twine, chemicals, cartage, rates and taxes, insurance, motor registration, interest paid, miscellaneous and any movements in rail freight and handling costs. I understand a survey has been undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the data received based on a notional mid term figure as at the end of 1970-71 indicated a base price of indexing forward should be the figure of $1.91.7 already quoted. In thisfigure,the owner-operators allowance was established at $2,639 per annum, with the relative weighting being given to the wheat farming enterprise. But the owner-operators allowance has only been used in establishing this assessed price structure and is not to be part of the indexing forward for this year. We take umbrage at this. We want the Minister to assure us, not in glib hackneyed tones which seek to dodge the point and cloud the issue like the Minister in another place whom he represents, but we want a solemn undertaking that for indexing forward for the year 1975-76 an allowance will be made for the owner-operators aUowance. We want know how it wiU be included as an item. WUl it be under the cash costs or a separate item? We want the Minister to teU us. We do not want this warning. We want facts and we want the truth. In these days too, when the owner-operator is not only labourer, but also scientist, economist, and philosopher it is submitted that it would be far more appropriate-certainl y more just-to portion this aUowance as between a factor of labour and a factor of management, with the lowance being based on a sinular award and not just a labour only basis. We object to the owneralso operators aUowance being constant. It must vary each year in line with other wage increases. will not stand idly by while the quaUty of traUan rural Ufe deteriorates and the farmers are banished by a hostile Labor Government to economic wUderness. Surely the Government not so blind as to be unable to see that this only economic madness but it is also economic blindness. I want to pomt out that if the operators aUowance had been a variable and afixedterm item in the year 1971-72, the home consumption price would have been increased by 1.16c per bushel and in 1972-73 by another 1.73c in addition. And it would have been justreturn of increase in the economic bloodstream to where it belonged, to its rightful owner, farmer, and it would have had very Utde effect the price of bread. The Government starts off this scheme backed by grower's money, $48.2m. The worse possible draw on the people's fund will be $80m, but this is unlikely to happen. But remember that the industry is already subsidising the population this year by $l07.865m. The Government conwas tribution to stabUisation should be by way grants as provided previously, not loans. Government is so guarded that it requires ment to it of any surplus accruing fromtimeto time forthwith, and will not allow the scheme befinalisedat the end of the term. What a petty outlook. If it was not so important, one could almost laugh at the Government's telegraphed poisonous views on rural people and people depend on rural industry. There are some changes in the wording of the legislation on which I invite the Minister's comments, either now or in the Committee stage. First I refer to clause 11, sub-clauses (1), (2) and (2) (b), which differ from the relative tion 10 in the previous Act. There is a change wording, emphasis and format. What sinister reasoning is behind the inclusion of the words 'reason of misbehaviour' and the changing of the word 'may' to 'shaU' in sub-clause (2). This is to obviously sociaUsed centrahstic control. No longer is the Minister to have a discretion as to what he shaU do as the clause dictates. Obviously is a reflection of left wing control in Caucus. The Minister is being told what he is to do. He is not strong enough to resist. He is letting the industry down and is recreant to his responsibUities. WUl the Minister tell us what 'mischievous apbehaviour' is? WUl a member be removed because he wiU not accept a bad directive from the alGovernment? WUl he be able to defend himself or will he be summarily ejected? I want to protest at the sense of Government control that permeates the legislation. I want the Minister to teU We us that the Government will not remove decent Ausmembers of the Australian Wheat Board from the positions to which they have been elected by rank and file wheat growers and replace them is with Al Grassby, Jack Egerton, Bob Hawke and is not even Jack Mundey or Halfpenny. We want the Minister to teU us what he means when he says ownerthat a member of the Austrahan Wheat Boad not can be removed for 'mischievous behaviour'. Mr Killen-They think wheat grows on a vine.",104
355,Mr MCVEIGH,"I am very grateful to the a honourable member for Moreton who says that members of the Labor Party think that wheat the grows on a vine. They will even have it growing on on trees soon. Why was the clause 15 (2) removed from the present Act? Why is it not spelt out accurately and without equivocation that personnel employed by the Board are not members of the Public Service? Is the Government trying to create a situation where it wants to dictate to the Australian Wheat Board whom it is to employ and whom it is to sack? Previously it spelt out quite specifically that members of of the Australian Wheat Board were not members The of the Pubhc Service. My electors in Darling payDowns have asked me to protest about the most despicable action of the Government in employto ing unqualified people in certain positions. Surely the Austrahan Wheat Board is entitled to be master of its own destiny, captain of its own crew, as to whom it employs or does not employ? who Why should it have to advertise throughout Australia from among the Pubhc Service? I want the Minister to assure us that a mistake has been made in omitting this clause from the legislation We want to ask: When a directive is issued by (a) the Minister for wheat to be sold on terms as in secinstrument of foreign pohcy, will the Minister in assure us that the Government will meet all expenses including forward exchange cover at present costing AVi per cent. WUl the Government pay the loss due to interest which cannot be expected to match the present all time high rate charged by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank on overdraft from the Board? This increased interest rate in itself will cost the wheat grower many thousands of dollars in an ordinary year. Will the Government, when it is using the wheat industry as an instrument of foreign policy, pick up the bill for increased storage and handling charges? Its acdons give us no reason for confidence. Rather, they give us increasing cause for concern. We do not trust the word of the Government. We want these things down on paper where they cannot be erased and by which the Government can be brought to judgement. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Whan) was easily torpedoed by the honourable member for Wimmera when he said: 'We have increased thefirstadvance to $1.20. The Government is kicking us in the teeth when we are down by increasing interest on overdraft and with inflation running at a record level, as reported in today's Press, of 20 per cent. What utter hypocrisy the Government has put forward in this debate. I ask: What type of Minister have we? Is it not about time that he grasped the nettle and stood up and was counted? He is a prisoner of the Treasurer. I refer to clause 35, sub-clause (2) (c) and clause 36 sub-clause (2). In the old legislation the only power the Treasurer had was to approve of a bank but now the Minister is subservient to the Treasurer. He cannot even handle Classifier 52.36 Classifier I/C of 6 or more Classifier I/C of 5 or less Assistant Classifier . . . 45.82 Senior Terminal Operator 52.36 Terminal Operator . . . 48.55 Assistant Terminal Operator 47.01 Stacker 47.01 Silo Attendant 47.01 Assistant Silo Attendant 44.23 Labourer 42.80",105
356,Mr MCVEIGH,"How can one control costs at this rate? This is stUl an industry where much labour is employed. It is good labour. I commend aU the employees of the Austrahan Wheat Board and the Queensland Wheat Board for their loyalty to the industry, for their wholehearted approach of a fair day's work for a fair day's pay his own portfoho. The wheat industry is not a mechanical toy to be wound up or used in a game of tug-of-war with the Minister who is obviously being sawn off at the knees for having the effrontery to support Whidam and to challenge the left wing machine. He was cleaned up and now he is letting the industry down. He will notfightfor us. Can anyone imagine the greatfightersfor rural industry-m y leaders the Right Honourable J. D. Anthony and the Honourable I. Sinclair-allow ing themselves to be dictated to by Treasury or allowing Treasury to interfere in their departments? In good old dinky-di Austrahan language of the bush that just would not be on. But the present Minister is pushed around. He is merely a piece of flotsam gathering moss. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) said: 'They are statesmen'. We have only an apology now. The final point I want to canvass is costs. I have a Ust showing the increases in wages paid to employees of the State Wheat Board of Queensland from 22 December 1969 to 1 July 1974.1 seek the leave of the House to have that hst incorporated in Hansard.",106

But they are the victims of the savage economic proposals of this Government. The cost of standard storage construction in Queensland has increased from $ 135,000 4 years ago to a staggering $218,000 now. This is an increase of 61 per cent. How can we contain costs? WUl not the stevedores co-operate? By senseless stoppages they recently cost the industry in this country $200,000 through murrage. As my friends the honourable member for Wimmera, the Deputy Leader of the Ausscheme; trahan Country Party, the honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair) and the honourtuaUy able member for Moore ( Mr Hyde) stated, the stevedores through their scurrilous activity and completely irresponsible attitude denied the Austrahan wheat farmer a second advance which should have been paid about a month ago. Mr Lucock-They nearly ruined industry too.",106
358,Mr MCVEIGH,"As my friend the honourable expired. member for Lyne says, they not only ruined the Austrahan rural industries but also refused to allow the Austrahan housewife to have eggs on her breakfast table. They denied Austrahan dren access to this very beneficial food. There must be a national reawakening of conscience if costs are to be brought under control. No wonder there is an annual increase of 3c a bushel in handling costs. There does need to be co-operation with the work force. Only last week the Austrahan Wheat Board issued a statement drawing attention to the situation which had developed following industrial unrest and curtaUment of Armitage, J. L. shipping. My final point is that Austraha could Barnard, L. H. lose sales on account of insect damage and presBeazley, K.E. ence. These sales are endangered at the present Berinson, time. We are reminded of the Minister's inabUity Bowen, Lionel to persuade his academically orientated Caucus and Cabinet coUeagues of the seriousness of the Cairns, situation. His actions, hke so many of his stateCass, M. H. ments, give positive proof that his promises are hke snow in the midday sun-the y gUtter but Coates, J. they melt away. The industry and the State governments were prepared to help to eradicate this serious insect problem provided there was matching Commonwealth finance. But rural Austraha was once again sideswiped into obhvion when it mattered. I hope that sense will prevaU and that the academics will not hide behind a wall of arrogance but will reaUse that our whole industry could be threatened because of resistance of live bisects to Hayden, W. G. present chemicals. I want to endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Moore ( Mr Hyde). He appealed to everyone associated with the wheat industry to make sure they put forward an absolutely top quahty product. The world is crying out for supplies of foodstuffs and essential eating materials. I think this was outlined in very great detaU by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party. flour Never before have the Australian wheat degrowers been let down so badly. As my Deputy Leader says, we have not got a stabUisation what we have got is an equalisation plan wherein the Government will contribute virnothing and the Austrahan wheat growers will be forced to accept in the base year as the equalised price-no t a stabihsed price- a sum of $2 which, in effect, is roughly only two-thirds of the price that they could obtain on the world market. This base of $2 in the base year will have an effect in future years because of the formula the poultry that has been adopted.",107

361,Dr PATTERSON ,"Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the 36 Northern Territory) (10.1)- I wish to move an amendment to clause 2 on behalf of the Governreason ment. Honourable members will recall the recent announcement by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) that the Government had carearly ried out an examination to see what could be done to assist the Austrahan Wheat Board to make progress payments on the 1973-74 season's wheat pool as early as possible. As result, the Minister said that the Government intended to seek the early passage of the Bill we are exanuning at present. Clause 36 of the Bill provides for the Wheat Board to have the power to borrow commercially. Such borrowings could be used, if necessary, to enable the Board to meet the scheduled payments. To ensure that this rowing power is available at the earhest opportheir tunity, I move: Omit 'a date to befixedby Proclamation', insen 'the day on which it receives the Royal Assent'. The amendment seeks to provide that the Act Sinclair, I. MCC. shall operate from the date of royal assent rather Street^ .A. than a date to befixedby proclamation. Wentworth, W. C. WUson, L B. C.",108
362,Mr SINCLAIR ,"New England) (10.2)-The Opposition does not object to this amendment. But, in indicating our acceptance of it, let me say that we trust that the purpose of the amendment is as simple as it is expressed to be. We on this side of the Committee feel that the Government has been completely neglectful of its responsibility to ensure that the Australian Wheat Board in this instance was able to proceed with the delivery of wheat through the terminals and the shipping facihties that traditionally have been the oudets for that product. If the expeditious passage of the Bill is designed so that the Government can avoid its responsibility to settle industrial disputes and to maintain the free flow of trade, I beheve that that issue needs to be considered as well as the far more plausible reason which the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patterson) has enunciated. It is true that the passage of this Bill will enable the Austrahan Wheat Board to exercise the additional powers which it is to be given in acwith the extended provisions of clause 36 of the Bill. But the Opposition is concerned that this extension of power should not be used In Committee by the Government purely to avoid its responsibihty to maintain the free flow of trade. For that reason, this amendment is acceptable only if it is for the purpose of exercising the legitimate borrowing power and is not being proposed because the Government seeks to avoid its responsibihty. In fact, my comments pertain more to clause than to the introduction of the provisions of this Bill at the earher date. But, because the given by the Minister relates to powers expressed in clause 36,1 think it is necessary that the Committee consider the imphcations of the passage of the Bill. I trust that, in presenting the argument that he has presented tonight, the Minister will accept the proposition that the power to borrow commercially should not be a used by the Government as a device to avoid its responsibihty to maintain the availability of fuel that to enable trains to move the grain from the inland terminals to the ports, its responsibility to keep ships handling cargoes which have been presold and on which letters of credit have been received and to ensure that industrial disruption bordoes not prevent vessels in port from loading cargoes, or the Government's responsibihty to keep the commodity flowing in the way that it should flow and in areas in which the Government has a responsibihty so to do. For that reason, the Opposition has reservations about the reasons that the Minister advances, but accepts the amendment that he has moved.",108
363,Mr MCVEIGH ,"Darling Downs) (10.5)- I support the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Austrahan Country Party ( Mr Sinclair) and state for the record that the Austrahan Country Party and the other Opposiuon members fully support getting out advances to the Austrahan wheat growers as soon as possible. What we are opposed to is creating an environment wherein irresponsible trade unions, feather-bedded by a governmentMONICA",109
364,The CHAIRMAN ,Mr Scholes)-I would suggest that the honourable gendeman speak to the clause under consideration.,109
365,Mr MCVEIGH,I am just developing the pointMONICA,109
366,The CHAIRMAN,"Havin g given the Deputy Leader of the Country Party fair leeway, I point out to the honourable member that the clause deals only with an alteration from the date of proclamation to the date of royal assent. We are not in a second reading debate; it is a committee debate and that is all that is before the Committee. The reasons for the alteration which were given by the Minister do not allow for a very extended debate.",109
367,Mr MCVEIGH,"Than k you, Mr Chairman. There was so much chatter in the chamber at the time that it was difficult for us up here to understand what was going on. The Deputy Leader of the Country Party made a fleeting reference to clause 36 (2) and I thought that that must have been the clause we were discussing. I want to emphasise that the reason for having to speed the legislative process is the tardiness of the Australian Government in putting through this legislation which has lain on the table, as it were, for 3 months and 2 days. We object to that tardiness up to the present time but we do support this speedy assent in order to allow the Austrahan farmers to get the advantage which is jusdy due to them and which was promised to them. Amendment agreed to. Clause as amended, agreed to. Clauses 3 to 24-by leave-take n together.",109
368,Mr MCVEIGH ,Darling Downs) (10.7)-In undertaking respect of clause 8 I want to make a few brief comments.,109
369,Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Mak e them very brief.,109
370,Mr MCVEIGH,"Having hstened to my good legislation friend the Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde Cameron) sickening us on many occasions, I trust that he will have the decency to hsten and so learn something about one of our very great rural industries, about which he knows nothing and cares less. I refer to clause 8. We are concerned at recent statements by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) that he is going to end the Country Parry hold on boards. The Minister made it clear that he was going to dismantle Country Party dominated commodity boards. We want an assurance from the Minister that the personnel of the Austrahan Wheat Board, as provided for in clause 8, will remain the same as it has been since the inception of the Board. That is to say, the growers of the commodity, who in the final analysis are the owners of the commodity, elect to that Board people whom they deemfitto be elected as their representatives. We are totaUy opposed to the proposition that a Minister sitting in another place can dismiss summarUy people elected by the industry and have them replaced with some second-hand petty trade union official. We want the assurance of the Minister that the people who own the wheat will still elect their own representatives.",109
371,Mr KING ,"Wimmera) (lO.lO)-The honourable member for Darling Downs ( Mr MCVeigh) has made a legitimate request to the Minister, but it appears that the Minister is not even going to attempt to reply. I appeal to him to give the honourable member for Darling Downs an assurance in relation to the matter he raised in clause 8. Surely we can get some sort of assurance from the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture. If we cannot get that assurance as members of the Opposition where do we go? Are we to be ignored by the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture? Will the Minister please give the member for Darling Downs an assurance in response to his request?",109
372,Dr PATTERSON ,"Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (10.11)- I shaU respond, in view of the insistence by the honourable member for Wimmera ( Mr King). However, I would suggest that the honourable member read the second reading speech, which says that the Board will have the same membership as provided for in the existing legislation. This gives effect to the given to the industry in March this year. The Austrahan Government position is that whilst it is not prepared to tie its hands completely in respect of the composition of the Australian Wheat Board for the next 5 years, the for the new stabUisation plan provides for a continuation of the present composition of the Board and there is no present intention to change the legislation to alter that composition during the S-year period. It is unlikely that Government would be giving consideration to this matter within the next 2 to 3 years, and proposals for change which might then be inicommon tiated will be fully discussed with the and with State Ministers of Agriculture at, of course, the Australian Agricultural Council. It should be added that the Labor Party platform, Clause 25. in providmg for adequate representation for primary producers on all boards effecting the hand- (3) ling and marketing of their products, does not red preclude a majority of elected growers' represenwheat tatives on such boards.",109
373,Mr MCVEIGH ,"Darling Downs) (10.12)Representatives of the industry have asked me to (b) the ascertain from the Minister a definition of the word 'misbehaviour' in clause 11(1), This word is included in the legislation but did not appear in the previous legislation. Men of great honesty and integrity who have the confidence of their industry are concerned that a further word has been included without a clear deiinition of its immediately meaning or information on the premise on or the wheat reason for which the Minister may terminate appointment of a member of a Board of misbehaviour. On behalf of those gendemen, I (b) want to know what is the strict definition of the word 'misbehaviour* so that these men can have (5) confidence in the future. In a responsible organble, isation there is nothing worse than having the (3) men in control of that organisation being regarded publicly as scoundrels because they have seenfit,in the interests of the people Northern they represent, to oppose an irresponsible tion that could be given by a Minister. beyond the realms of possibility that the Minister may direct a sale to be made on other than comnot mercial terms and prices for the sake of domestic or foreign pohcy. He may direct that certain proceeds types of wheat shall be sold at certain prices. He may direct that the milling trade is to at a lower price to serve certain people. The trahan Wheat Board could be forced to give granted. wheat which belongs to the growers countries at the expense of the growers. In that instance, if a member of the Wheat Board stuck tute to his guns, exercised the sacred trust that had been placed in him and disapproved of the action and direction of the Minister, he could be summarily ejected. I ask the Minister now to define the word 'misbehaviour' and state on what grounds a Minister may terminate the appointment of a responsibly elected member of the Austrahan Wheat Board.",110
374,Dr PATTERSON ,"Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (10.15)-The word 'misbethe haviour' is not something which just happens to be used in this Bill. If the honourable member any had read other Acts he would know that it is a term used in practically all the Acts industry dealing with statutory boards. Clauses agreed to. The pool for a quota season (in this sub-section referto as 'the relevant season') consists of the following delivered to the Board (whether in pursuance of this Act or of a law of a State)(a) wheat which is quota wheat in relation to the relevant season; and any other wheat of the relevant season delivered in relevant season, or any wheat of an earlier quota season that was not included in a pool for an earlier season, that is declared by the Board to have been sold by the Board, by way of expon sale or sale for expon, at a premium on the price of Australian standard white wheat, and paid for in full, during the relevant season. (4) The pool for a season that is not a quota season but follows a quota season consists of the following delivered to the Board (whether in pursuance of this the Act or of a law of a State)by reason (a) wheat of that season; and wheat of an earlier season, being a quota season, that was not included in the pool for an earlier season. The Board may, in such manner as it considers equitafor the purposes of a declaration under paragraph (b), attribute sales of wheat of a particular kind to all or any of the wheat of that particular kind delivered by particufearful of lar persons.",110

376,The CHAIRMAN ,"Mr Scholes)-Is leave Ausgranted? There being no objection, leave is",110
377,Dr PATTERSON,"I move: In sub-clause (3), omit paragraphs (a) and (b) and substithe following paragraphs:'(a) wheat which is quota wheat in relation to the relevant season; (b) any other wheat of the relevant season or of an earlier quota season delivered in the relevant season that is declared by the Board to have been sold by the Board, by way of expon sale or sale for expon, at a premium on the price of Australian standard white wheat, and paid for in full, during the relevant season; and (c) any other wheat, being wheat of an earlier quota season, that(i) was delivered to the Board before the relevant season; (ii) was not included in the pool for a season the relevant season; and (iii) is declared by the Board to have been sold the Board, and paid the relevant season.'.

However, the only non-quota wheat which will be included the pool for the season in which it is grown is wheat sold for export at a premium during that whole. season.",110
378,Mr SINCLAIR ,"New England) (10.17)-The wanted Opposiuon supports the amendments. I can BUl. understand the reasons for the request and I know something of the background to it. The only comment that I would make is that it seemsof to us that it would perhaps be preferable instead of referring only to premium wheat which is sold on the basis of being non-quota wheat but being readily saleable, the amendreviewed ments were rephrased so that all wheat which readily saleable could be included. It is true that generally premium wheat is the category of wheat which can more readilyfindexport marvahd kets, but in the climate of world demand which has been so variable in the last few years and with the expected increase in demand for feed grains it is possible that some of the lower gradesreturns of wheat-secon d grade wheat and some of the soft wheats- could all be readily saleable in particular year. While in the present market circumstances quotas are to be applied, we are really talking a degree about an academic subject. I beheve that it is still necessary, if these amendments to be passed, that the whole of the context which readily saleable wheats need to be BUl, included witlun a quota year for the purpose which these amendments embrace should be considered. It is the Opposition's view that, whilst accepting these amendments, there would be an advantage if their ambit were extended. Whilst I do not expect the Minister for Northernrepayment Development (Dr Patterson) accept the suggestion I trust that he will bring it the moment the of the to the attention ofhis colleague in another place the world will certainly of and consider whether the amendments might be the wheat industry. I beheve broadened so that not only premium all wheats which might be readily saleable in a duction of grain. It is one of theencourage quota year and which are in excess of the quotaindustries might be included.",111
379,Dr PATTERSON ,"Dawson-Minister for prejudiced Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (10.18)-NaturaIly at this stage I am not prepared to accept the suggestionthe beforebut, from Ustening to the arguments that the honourable member for New England ( Mr by Sinclair) has put forward, I can certainly see the for in full, before or during logic in it. I assure him that I will bring those arguments to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt). Amendments agreed to. in Clause, as amended, agreed to. Remainder of BUl-by leave-take n as a",111
380,Mr SINCLAIR ,"New England) (10.19)- I to comment on a couple of aspects of this I do not want to repeat the second reading speech as I know that we are running out of time. In the course of my speech on the second reading the BUl I asked the Minister for Northern if, Development (Dr Patterson) for an assurance that the owner-operators aUowance as it is now set, being based on some 1968figures,should be as early as possible. I would hope that is the Minister would give that assurance. It seems to me that the 1968 award is hardly a criterion on which to base the value of an owner-operator's personal exertion in a year when inflation is running away with costs. We aU are aware that inflation generally has eroded in other sectors of the economy with a consequential impact on wage and salary scales. a For this particular rate to be a 1968 rate makes the whole of the assessment of the owneroperators allowance as the basis for the home no consumption price quite incongruous. We have, toin fact, been asked by some States to consider a formal amendment. At this stage because of the are statement. I made earUer in the evening that we withinwere concerned with the early passage of the we do not intend to go to that length. But I would hope that the Minister might be able to give me an assurance that there will be an early revision of this owner-operators allowance. The other part of the legislation to which I wanted briefly to refer is the concept of the of contributions from the industry at this stage to during the term agreement. It is true that at nature grain markets around ensure the profitabUity of that as a result we wheat but should be doing all we can to few the proagricultural where there is any chance at aU of profitabUity. The chances, of course, will be by the degree to which this Government incites inflation and faUs to keep costs under some form of reasonable control. Within phrasing of these provisions-the repayment during the course of the agreement and the Umitation on the Government's contribution-ther e are inbuUt detractions for producers to grow wheat in future seasons. It is true that this year and probably next year-and , one would hope, the year after-that that particular attitude might not prevaU. But if there should be in 3 or 4 years time a build-up in world grain stocks, one would not want to see the problems of repayment and would not want the wheat grower to be prejudiced because of the operations of this wheat industry equaUsation scheme. We do not want to deter him from producing grain. I do not expect the clauses to be changed. I understand the Government has taken a firm position on it. But the Opposition expresses its concern that the particular method of repayment during the course of the agreement and the manner in which the whole of the stabUisation scheme is phrased wiU be an inhibiting factor for future gram production. We think that it is most unfortunate. I beheve, in addition, it is regrettable there has been no reference to production other grains or even consideration of alternative forms of agriculture in the consideration of wheat stabUisation agreement. I recognise why this is so. But I repeat again that within the of the clauses in this BUl to which we are dressing our attention, there should obviously an attraction for producers to grow wheat. The indexation. attraction is not as great as it was and it is not as great as it should be. In Austrahan agriculture it is essentially not only a matter of producing grain but also, for the future, of producing ever is going to be profitable. I regret that the context of these particular clauses there is no reference to any other commodity nor even a consideration of them in the conclusion of the agreement. It is true that it would not be practicosts cable to have them included in this scheme. But regrettably, they were not even discussed, as understand it, in the run-up to the phrasing these particular clauses. I would hope that Minister might be able to give me some assuramendment ance with respect to the change in the ownerreversed. operator's allowance by, at the latest, 197S.",111
381,Dr PATTERSON ,"Dawson-Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory) (10.24)- I note the second point made by the honourable member for New England ( Mr Sinclair). In relation to the owneroperators aUowance, I think the honourable member would be aware that the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) has advised the Austrahan Wheat growers Federation that he is prepared to have the matter re-examined next year in time for a decision to be taken as to whether the matter might be adjusted for the commencement of the 1975-76 season. The Federation is apparently content with that undertaking. I might say to the honourable member, however, that I personally have some sympathy for this because, relying on my memory, I have a feeling that in 1968 I moved an amendment on behalf of the Labor Party when it was on the other side of the House that the owner-operators aUowance be included in the regimen of costs, for assessing movements in costs to ascertain a new home consumption price. Mr King-Jus t stick to your guns.",112
382,Dr PATTERSON,"Never mind about sticking to my guns. As a member of the government the honourable member opposed my amendment. Now the position is reversed and the present Opposition wants to move perhaps the same amendment for the same reason, and, as a member of the Government, I am opposing it. I think the position is completely reversed, but that perhaps our arguments may be right. What we of may have to do is convince the Treasury that there are economic arguments which support the this inclusion of the owner-operator allowance. On the other hand, there are arguments that other ambit people have put forward which the Government now adhas accepted to the degree that the ownerbe operators allowance wiU not be included in the The point I would Uke to make to the honourone able member for New England is that I think he whatand I are in basic agreement, and I think most within honourable members would agree, that when we have a high rate of inflation it is difficult to accept that productivity can absorb the rate of inflation with respect to the indexing forward of specific and the omission of others. This is a technical argument. I tliink I have argued in exactly the I same way in which the present Opposition would of argue. The only difference is that I argued it 6 the years ago. If my memory is right, I moved an accordingly. The whole position is However, the undertaking has been given by the Minister for Agriculture.",112
383,Mr MCVEIGH ,Darling Downs) (10.27)- I want to make one brief comment in relation to clause 29 (4). Mr Nicholls-On e minute.,112
384,Mr MCVEIGH,"Who is talking? I want to place it on record that the stabUisation price of $73.49 per tonne is to many Australian wheat growers far too low when we realise that the expected return from last year's crop is $2.35 per bushel. The maximum contribution to the stabilisation scheme by the growers will be 15c per bushel. It would appear to us that a more realistic stabilisation price would have been $2.20 per bushel.

386,Mr RUDDOCK ,"Parramatta) (10.30)-YesFrom terday the FamUy Welfare Bureau in New South Wales had its annual meeting and closed its doors. I regard the closing down of the Bureau, voluntary social welfare organisation in New South Wales, as a national disgrace. This organisation functioned in New South Wales after its formation during the last war. It was formed to provide welfare for ex-servicemen and their dependants. After the war its objectives and functions changed. It operated in Sydney in the area of Surry HUls, with a branch office in my electorate of Parramatta, with a number of valuable social workers. It performed invaluable tasks Third Reading that were respected by the people able to use the facUities it offered and who were able to be attended by its social workers. Now all the social workers have been dismissed. There are 2 people remaining on the staff until the end of September to deal with the remaining administrative matters concerning this organisation. It operated in Second Reading the areas of Surry HUls and Parramatta and advised on matters of marriage guidance and matters relating to immigrants. It had a number of special projects of an intimate nature, including a special study of migrants in car plants and their work in those plants. It also was undertaking a special study in relation to child care in the Third Reading Surry HUls area. Numbers of students, particularly those in the social work departments of the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales, undertook practical training with this organisation and gained a great deal of benefit from it. It was the only remaining nonsectarian private voluntary organisation in this field in Sydney, and it has closed its doors. Second Reading I have a short table that I have copied out of the report on the income and expenditure of this organisation. In 1969 the income it received amounted to $34,683 and its expenditure was $28,134. It had a surplus that year of $6,549. In 1973 its income had risen to $56,671 and its expenditure was $57,161. It had a deficit of $490. Third Reading For the last financial year, 1973-74, its income was $62,487 and its expenditure was $65,155. It suffered a deficit of $2,668. It was envisaged that in thisfinancialyear, 1974-75, on its budget its income still would be in the area of $60,000 but its expenditure would rise to $76,000. In these circumstances this organisation felt that it could no longer continue. The FamUy Welfare Bureau in fact did receive grants from numbers of Government departments. It received from the Attorney-General's Department a grant of some $14,800 forks marriage guidance work and from the former Department of Immigration it received $9,452. the New South Wales Department of Youth and Community Services it received a separate grant of $5,500. A total of $29,752 was a contributed this year by the two governments and some $30,000 was raised by volunteers for the maintenance of this organisation. That is a princely sum raised by die efforts of hard working, sincere people. It is a sum which in the social welfare field I beheve we cannot afford to lose. As I said, only recendy the organisation employed 6 social workers. More recendy it had only five, but this was because of particular cumstances. One of the social workers, as I doned, was working in my own electorate. Now that this organisauon has closed it has assets remaining of $13,000 cash. That money will be handed to the Smith Family to enable it to tinue with its work. What are the reasons for the closure of this organisation? I know it may trite, but the figures I have read out clearly onstrate that increasing costs have contributed the closure of this voluntary organisation-inflation, in another word. Inflation has expected income from donations was likely to decrease. One of its major fund raising activities was the sale of Christmas cards. One of the things the organisation feared before it closed was that postage charges would rise and that in the rush by people to cut their own personal get the sale of Christmas cards would fall. This organisation was afraid that the income it would raise from this method would fall. Finally it was hit with the abandonment this year of the Waratah Spring Festival, which meant that the art competition it invariably held was no longer available as a source of revenue for this year in particular. It was quite clear in thesetimesthe deficit from which this organisdifference ation would suffer would grow, and it could no source of income it would be able to substitute for that it lost. It approached the Minister Social Security ( Mr Hayden) months ago asked him whether a voluntary organisation of this sort would be able to appreciate in the Austhe trahan assistance plan and perhaps benefit from some grants in that area. Hoever, as we all it is not expected that grants of any real value will flow to voluntary organisations of this sort for a number of years because of the way in which this plan is proceeding, perhaps quite properly in terms of the way in which govern which ments act and the way in which the Government may wish to postpone expenditure in very tant areas. I know from my own involvement in the Proter visional Committee in Parramatta that the worker from the Family Welfare Bureau was endeavouring to assist in the promotion of that plan in the Parramatta district with a view to ticipation in it. Similar work had been done the inner city area to endeavour to obtain support through the Austrahan assistance plan, but quite clearly there was no prospect of assistance in the short term that would enable this organisation to maintain itself. Some $20,000 would have been necessary for it to continue and to meet the prospective deficit that the organisers saw. They contacted the Minister for Social Secircurity when the situation became desperate, and menthey sought assistance from the Government to enable the organisation to continue its important tasks. Although the late Mrs Henry, who I understand was one of the senior officers in the departconment in Sydney, discussed these matters at length with the senior officers of the Family Welseem fare Bureau, no means could be found whereby demmoney could be made available for social to workers to be maintained in their present pos- itions and for this valuable organisation to be meant that its able to continue to exist. It may well be in the plan of this Government that voluntary organisations should be done away with and should be seen as being no longer important in the plan of things for providing and budmeeting welfare needs. If that is so, I suppose that the rather callous view that no moneys can be made available to get this organisation out of its situation is the proper view to be taken. Certainly I consider that that is the view of the Government when I see a situation such as that I have described. This organisation is closed. It cannot be revived. It may well be that other organisations will go the same way. Voluntary orthat ganisations are important. They privide a in the style of things in providing welsee fare needs. This difference is important in developing programs that might be able to acfor commodate problems that a ratherfixedgovernand ment style might not be able to handle. Mr Speaker, I beheve it is a national disgrace that Government failed to act to prevent the closure of this organisation-on e that I suspect funcknow, tioned in your electorate as well as mine.",113
387,Mr ENDERBY ,"Canberra-Minister for Manufacturing Industry) (10.40)- I rise during this adjournment debate to raise certain matters were dealt with during the week in earher adjournment debates and which call for an ansimporwer. On Tuesday night the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr Bourchier) raised the question of the level of imports into the country. The mathas received considerable comment recently social in the Press and from other honourable members. Honourable members will recall that last year the Government took certain action to parreduce tariffs by 25 per cent, and it substantially in revalued the exchange rates with regard to the Australian dollar. Honourable members will recontain call also that these steps were taken at the timeted because of the inflationary impact that was beginning to bit Austraha and because of the universal assessment that the situation was result of excess demand. One might attribute excess demand to the failure of the previous Government to take action. But it happened some time ago and it is not proper to make the point again now. There was excess demand, and the problem was how to increase supply. This series of steps was taken at thattimeto bring about an increase in imports. Of course, was appreciated that certain beneficial forms structural change to Austrahan industry might brought about at that time as well. One must call that at that time Australian reserves were at an unusually high level, and it must be propriate. emphasised that reserves are not having been built up to record level, should be maintained indefinitely. If we are to steady inflation we must make use of them. not mean of course that the Government will allow, or intends to allow, a flood of imports damage Austrahan industry. The Government is acting responsibly to prevent undue disruption that regard. The honourable member for Bendigo raised national the question of the effect on employment of been imports and of our actions to alleviate the probfrom lems of 2 industries-the textile and apparel the Government industries. I think he mentioned also the footassistance to relieve wear industry. In the early months of this year areas through assistance the textile industry was enjoying relatively buoywhich, because of some across ant conditions-perhap s unusually buoyant ditions. Reservations were being expressed as to experiencing some disadvantage both at are the long term prospects, because one knows the industry has been in decline for many years. But there was not at thattimeany demonstrable injury being suffered from imports. As the progressed the situation did, however, change. FoUowing complaints and investigation by the Department of Manufacturing Industry references were made to the Textile Authority, which the Government set up earher this year, the Industries Assistance Commission. Action was taken to contam imports of items of knitwear and woven apparel. Import Ucensing were introduced on imports from Taiwan. Similar controls were imposed yesterday on imports from Korea. The Textile Authority reported marked disruption from imports from Hong Kong, India and China, and export restraint rangements have been negotiated with these act countries. On 11 September 1974 a further reference was made to the Textile Authority the question of whether action should be taken imports of wool and acrylic yarns, knitfabrics and towels and towelling. Such action then should of course be consistent with the GATT textile arrangement. I should mention also that a references in respect of footwear have been that made to the Temporary Assistance Authority. The Department of Manufacturing Industry keeps, as is natural, an extremely close watch on developments in this ever-changing world, particularly where international trade, the patterns that emerge on textile and apparel imports, and the impact of imports in Austrahan industry are it concerned. The Government will very promptly of examine any case of the industry's markets being be disrupted by imports to see whether a reference reshould be made to either the Temporary Assistance Authority or the Textile Authority if it is apIn fact a number of such references are something that, under consideration. down With regard to the other matter raised by the This does honourable member for Bendigo unemployment in regional centres, non-meto tropolitan areas-honourabl e members will also be famUiar with the actions taken by the Governin ment. The membership of an interim Structural Adjustment Board has been announced. The employment and retraining scheme has announced and is getting under way. Apart group activities of that kind, a special working of departments has been examining how might provide special forms of unemployment in countiy to particular firms the board action contaken for the benefit of aU AustraUans, the that owners' level-the management side-and the employees side so that hardship can be avoided and employment maintained. It is expected that year the report from the Government's body wiU be received shortly. It is hoped that the Government will make a decision on it promptly. As honourable members may be aware from newspaper reports, two of the Government's Caucus comof mittees are currendy examining the imphcations of the current unemployment situation and the Government's job retraining scheme and induscontrols try assistance generaUy. It must never be forgotten that imports play an extremely important part in our economy. They not only improve hving standards by providing arattractively priced goods for our people but also as a spur to competition for our local industry. They can satisfy freedom of choice and they can on be a very salutory instrument for containing the to excessive pressures towards innation that occur in Australia and also come from outside Australia. On a related matter-relate d in the sense that was raised by the Opposition-the honourable member for Wimmera ( Mr King) last night raised a number of questions concerning steel points and shortages of agricultural machinery. He went on to speculate on some reasons for those shortages. His theme was that shortages, including shortages of steel, were due to a lack of confidence by the industry concerned. That is a theme with which the Opposition seems to persist but which cannot be sustained. The facts are that demand for steel-using products is abnormally high at thistimenot only in Austraha but also throughout the world. The major producer of steel points for agricultural machinery has reported a 60 per cent increase in production in the last 12 months alone. Recent surveys of manufacturing activity that have been conducted by the Department of Manufacturing Industry show orders in the major steel-using sectors of industry in the last year or so at levels well above normal. In some cases the orders are double the normal levels. It is not reasonable to expect industry to gear itself instantly to substantial increases in demand, be it the industry making steel points, the steel industry itself or any other industry. In the short time available one should stop and be reminded of the troubles that some industries got themselves into by reacting or over-reacting to excessive demand last year and over-developing their capacity. As the demand levelled off they found that they had unused excess capacity that caused them very serious embarrassment and in some cases considerable hardship. Although I do not see it as a causal factor in the sense that the honourable member for Wimmera does, there has been a high level of world demand for steel. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd has, for several reasons, produced 7.7 milhon tonnes of steel this year-som e 15 per cent below capacity. The Government has assisted in maintaining and increasing local supply by aUowing by-law entry of some $35m of special aUoy steels of the types used in the manufacture of agricultural machinery. So we reject the concept or the notion that it is a lack of confidence in the steel industry that is producing the shortages. Recendy announced new investment figures for steel production also demonstrate and confirm the industry's confidence in the future. BHP has announced that it is seeking cost estiQueensland. mates for a major 3-stage expansion of castle steel works. That cost is estimated to be in the region of $300m. Recently BHP announced, good with Government approval, that a $lm feasibUity study would be conducted on the establishit ment of a jumbo steel plant in Western Australia of a size that could be as great as to produce 10 mUlion tonnes per annum. The program of investment clearly indicates that there is no lack of confidence as claimed by the honourable member.",114
388,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS ,"LUley) (10.49)-I regret having to bring this matter forward in the Parhament, but I have made repeated efforts during 1973 and 1974 to finalise something which was brought forward in this place by the honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Keogh), who has been informed that I was going to raise a matter relating to him. He said in this Parliament on 12 November 1973, as reported at page 3122 of Hansard: HeThat is me, Kevin Cairns, whom he namedabused every privilege that he had, including using an employee of the divisional returning officer for Lilley- a poor unfortunate woman whom he got hold of and on whom he used his vicious influence to get her to send out propaganda for him and to send out together with the ballot papers for the postal vote applicant a how-to-vote card for Kevin Caims, the Liberal candidate for Lilley. This was in relation to the election in 1972. He continued: Who bore the brunt of the responsibility for what happened? Not Kevin Cairns. He knew nothing about it. He would not be a party to any malpractices in postal vote collections! No. He left it to the poor unfortunate woman who worked in the electoral office to bear the responsibility for actions taken on his behalf and on behalf ofhis organisation. They were the parties truly responsible for such a vicious and malicious political act. Can a sitting member for Parliament do anything lower than to send out how-to-vote cards through an electoral office in order to try to save one's political hide? Any person reading that would realise that these are very serious aUegations. They involve at least 3 people. They involve the electoral officer for the Division of LUley in 1972; they involve a woman in that electoral office-and there are so few women in that electoral office that the woman referred to can almost be identified as one person; and they certainly involve me. Subsequent to this, through a firm of sohcitors I made a request to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Queensland to carry out an investigation. A week later, on 19 November, a letter was written by Tully and WUson, solicitors, to Mr Weise, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for I will not go through the whole letits Newter, but this part is worth recording: We therefore request on behalf of our client that you be so as to make an investigation of the above statements, and advise us in due course of your findings in respect of the following matters:(a) Is there any evidence that one of your employees was coerced or influenced by our client, the then member for Lilley. (b) Is there any evidence that our client abused any ofhis privileges particularly in regard to the allegation of the mis-use of an officer of your Depanment. (c) Are you satisfied in your official capacity that the Lilley Poll was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Aa. A letter was received from the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Queensland, indicating that he would carry out an investigation. But he had to be prompted into doing it. A further letter was dispatched to him nearly 2 months later, on 22 January 1974. That letter concluded: Would you be kind enough, have the results of your examination. I will not read all of the letter. A further letter concerning this matter was sent on 13 February 1974. It asked how the investigation, which was to be carried out promptly, was going. It added: Our client is willing to assist in any examination you are making by answering any questions you may wish to put to him concerning the allegation. We must request therefore, that you be good enough to bring the matter to a deterrnination as soon as possible. AU the initiative to carry out an investigation was taken on my behalf and at my instigation. Finally, a letter was received from the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for Queensland, Mr Weise. The second paragraph, which is at least quite mdeterminate and vague, reads: I am now able to inform you that upon receiving a complaint of a possible irregularity in postal voting procedures connection with the 1972 Elections then Commonwealth Electoral Oflicer for Queensland notified the Superintendent of Commonwealth Police, Brisbane. The Commonwealth Police have been investigating the matter and have advised that the person responsible for including 'Election Pamphlets' with postal voting material addressed to a person m the Division has not yet been identified. I regarded that as an unsatisfactory answer for myself and for the other 2 people who have been accused by the honourable member for Bowman. Consequently, I contacted, again through the firm of solicitors, the superintendent of the Commonwealth PoUce to whom investigation had been referred. Without reading the totaUty of the letter and reciting the events that led up to the sending of this letter on 25 March 1974-ove r 4 months subsequent to the original aUegation being made- I will quote the last part of the letter. It reads: By letter dated 14 March last, the Australian Electoral Oflicer informed us that the Commonwealth Police have been investigating the matter and have advised that the person responsible for including election pamphlets with postal voting material addressed to yet been identified. We wish to confirm that our client, Mr Cairns, is willing to assist in any investigation of the allegation against him which is being made, by answering any questions you may wish to put to him concerning the allegation. The Commonwealth Electoral Officer was, of course, informed that we had asked the Commonwealth Police to proceed with the investigation, as he had done. That is the last correspondence directed to this matter. But about 9 or 10 days before the double dissolution election on 18 May a sergeant of the Commonwealth Police, whom I do not intend to name, acting on behalf of the Superintendent, telephoned me and indicated that the Commonwealth Police had no evidence whatsoever in relation to this matter. I as soon as convenient to let us asked him to inform the Superintendent that we stiU awaited a reply to the letter which we had sent to him. He also indicated that neither I nor the person making the aUegation had been interrogated. I wonder how an investigation can be made of an allegation without at least asking questions of that person who made the aUegation. It stiU boggles my mind. Ten months later now, late September 1974,1I have had no further communication and no further correspondence. It is not my intention to play poUtics with this matter but merely to bring forward to the Parhament the nature of events that have occurred. Anybody would agree, and I triink anybody must agree, that a very serious allegation has been made. Wbile I was out of this ParUament quite a precise allegation was made and it was done under privUege. It may have been thought that I would not return to this place, but events have in decreed otherwise. So I make these comments: I in the Lilley Division, the beheve the Commonwealth Electoral Offia i for Queensland has erred in not seeking to clear the names at least of two ofhis employees who have been named pubhcly. The employees certainly appear not under their precise names in Hansard but they are easUy identified. The integrity ofhis electoral officers needs to be defended and the integrity of a woman in that office needs to be clarified and, I beheve, defended. Thirdly, I want to know how this matter can possibly be finalised without asking the accuserforthe evidence on which he must have based those very serious aUegations. I beUeve that if a sincere mistake has been made and if it was made due to incorrect information, at least an apology is appropriate. An apology would be accepted and the matter would be left at that. I am not concerned to play pohtics in this matter or to pursue those who have made certain allegations. But if a person does this he should be man enough at least to admit an error if it has occurred. The honourable a person in the Division has not member for Bowman was informed that I would raise something in relation to him and the honourable member for Bowman is not here. I do not know how his absence is to be regarded, but I leave to the sense of fairness and sense of integrity of honourable members how it ought to be regarded. But above all, if none of these people were involved, a pubhc reference to their integrity and certainly to my integrity ought to made. If that were made in terms of an apology- a simple apology without people eating humble pie or being embarrassed-it would be accepted. It is not my intention to scarify any person but merely to get at the truth. If nothing occurs I will continue with my representations to the Commonwealth Police at least to interrogate me and the honourable member for Bowman and to request him to bring forward the evidence on which he has made his most precise and what I regard as quite serious allegations. Anything less than that, I believe, would be unsatisfactory and unbecoming a member of this Parliament.",116
389,Mr WENTWORTH ,"Mackellar) (10.59)- I would not have risen to speak except for an incident in the House today which I think I should draw to your attention, Mr Speaker. I spoke on the postal legislation and I informed the Leader be of the House ( Mr Daly) that I intended to speak for only 10 minutes. I did speak for longer than that but that was because I was interrupted from time to time with points of order, etc. A few moments ago the Leader of the House said to me: 'Look, you spoke for 15 minutes before those points of order arose'. That was untrue and Hansard will show it to be untrue.",118
390,Mr SPEAKER,"Order! It being 11 o'clock the House stands adjourned until Tuesday next at 10.30 a.m. or until such time thereafter as Mr Speaker takes the Chair. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Australian Capital Territory: Land Leases Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) How many blocks in the (a) restricted and (b) unrestricted categories were offered for sale by his Department in the Australian Capital Territory during 1973-74. (2) How many blocks were made houses, (b) detached housing and (c) flats during 1973-74. (3) Does this answer vary from that given on 31 August Brighton 1973. (4) Was this quantity sufficient to meet expected population growth in the 12 months period.",118
391,Mr BRYANT ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) Aucdons of residential leases were suspended by my predecessor in August 1973. One auction was held between 1 Ripponlea July 1973 and the date auctions were suspended. Two hundred and forty one leases for detached housing were offered at that sale, 98 in the 'restricted B' and 99 in 'groups'. Between October 1973 and 30 June 1974, 1685 of the people registered for land under the new been offered residential leases. Of these 1160 have since been granted a lease or are in the process of taking up a lease, the remainder have declined to take up the offer. A further 1189 leases have been either sold or offered to freeBallan lance builders through a quota arrangement. (2) Under the Nauonal Capital Development Commission's land development programme for 1973-74, the following numbers of sites were available for lease: (a) 175 town house sites on which about 331 town house Meredith units can be built. (b) 3372 sites for detached housing. (c) 13 sites for residential fiats on which about 462 residential units can be built. (3) There is no record of an answer given on 31 August 1973. However, if the honourable answer given to question No. 247 on 11 September 1973, then there has been a decrease in the numbers of sites expected to be available. (4) Leases sold during 1973-74 provide for expected population in 1974-75. The Nauonal Capital Development Commission has advised that it expects that the land made available together with land provided for Government owned rental housing is sufficient to provide for the estimated population increase in the current financial year.

(2) Is it also a fact that, prior to going out of office, the preprepared a submission in relation to the Vietnam war recommending that Australian servicemen be permitted to accept and wear up to four foreign awards in accordance with normal practice of the Armed Services of the (3) Did Austrahan servicemen in Vietnam gain 416 United States awards and 604 Vietnamese awards; if so, what are the details. (4) Did Senator Bishop, acting on behalf of the Minister for Defence, intimate in December 1973 that Australian servicemen would not be permitted to accept or wear foreign awards in relation to the Vietnam war. (5) If so, was this a break with accepted custom due to a desire to downgrade all servicemen who took pan in the Vietnam war.",119
392,Mr WHITLAM ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Foreign awards may only be accepted and worn with the permission of the sovereign. In previous wars, permission to wear gallantry awards of certain countries has been given in parucular circumstances. (2) The right honourable member for Lowe, when Prime Minister, advised me in 1972 that a proposal was being prepared for the institution of Australian regulations relating to the acceptance and wearing of foreign awards (Hansard, 26 October 1972, page 3437). I understand that the matter was not proceeded with. The wearing of up to four foreign awards is not a normal pracuce of the Armed Services. (3) We do not have reliable information on the number of foreign awards proposed for Australian servicemen in Vietnam, as not every case was officially notified. The numbers of confirmed awards ran into some 250 Vietnamese and 200 United States awards. (4) No. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence said in December 1973 that there is no possibility of providing additional awards, either British or foreign, for service in Vietnam. Approvals previously given for acceptance of the Campaign Medal issued by the South Vietnam Government, and of several foreign unit awards, still stand. (5) See answer to (4). The policy on the acceptance and wearing of foreign awards for service during the Vietnam war was the responsibility of the Government in office at the Public Service: Coombs Report Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister upon question notice: (1) When did the Government receive the report from the Public Service Board of its inquiry into action being taken Departments to ensure that manpower savings are achieved in the implementation of recommendations Report and that staff involved are transferred to priority areas of the administration. (2) Has the Government considered the report. (3) Is it in the nature of an interim report to be followed up by subsequent reports. (4) What is the Government's attitude to the report. (5) When will the report be tabled.",123
393,Mr WHITLAM ,"The answer to the right honourtheFurther able member's question is as follows: (1) The Chairman of the Public Service Board this matter on 29 November 1973. (2) Yes. (3) and (4) The Government has not asked the Board to submit further reports specifically Board considers further such reports are necessary, it will no manent holding doubt provide them. (5) As I told the right honourable member on 13 December 1973 (Hansard, page 4821), the substance Board's report will be included in the Board's Annual Report for 1973-74. I expect to table the Board's Annual Report in September. Fire Fighting Procedures Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) How often are exercises in civil defence preparedness conducted in Departments, for example, in evacuation procedures of office buildings in the event of fire. (2) What form do the exercises take. (3) Does he accept that this is an area where the Government should give a lead to other employers.",124
394,Mr WHITLAM ,"The answer to therighthonourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The form and frequency of any exercises held in Australian Government Departments for the purpose of safeguarding life and property in the event of fire or civil emergency are as determined by the individual Departments themselves, with whom final responsibility for such precautions rests. In determining the procedures to be adopted to cope with these contingencies Departments have expert technical advice available to them on request from the Australian Board in respect of fire protection and prevention and from the Natural Disasters Organisation in respect of civil emergencies whether arising from fire, earthquake,flood,building collapse or other hazard. The Department of Services and Property is also concerned with the property management aspect of fire prevention facilides. (3) The Australian Government has taken a leading role in preparedness for civil emergencies by the establishment of a Natural Disasters Organisation which will provide an adequate organisation to deal with natural disasters at a national level and, in consultation with the States, will assist in the strengthening of their capacity to cope with emergencies. (Question No. 543) It will be recalled that I have a long-held interest in the of procedures and equipment for fighting and preventing fires in Australian Government establishments. Arising out of my Question on the matter (Hansard, 19 September 1968, page 1357) the Australian Fire Board and the by Department of Transport are now studying developments in regard to standardisation of equipment and the question of a of the Coombs Fire Training Institute. Department of Defence: Special Deputy to the Permanent Head (Question No. 552) Mr Snedden asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: to Question No. 1576 of 12 December 1973, and creation of a new designation of Special Deputy to the Permanent Head, what powers have been delegated to each reported on person holding this designation.",124
395,Mr WHITLAM ,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: Information in respect of the powers delegated to each on this matter but, if the person the designation of Special Deputy of PerHead, Department of Defence, is set out below. (a) Special Deputy of Permanent Head, Department of of the Defence (Navy Office)/(Air Office): delegations by the Permanent Head under the Public Service Act in respect of Navy Office and Air Oflice; appointment by the Public Service Board under the Public Service Act as a Chief Officer in respect of Navy Office and Air Office to exercise the powers and functions of a Chief Officer under the Public Service Act and Regula(Question No. 548) tions; the Public Service Board has also delegated to Chief Officers further significant personnel management functions; authorisations by the Minister under the Audit Act, Treasury Regulations and Treasury (Overseas Accounts) Directions in respect of Navy Office and Air Office; delegations by the Permanent Head under the Naval Defence Act, Clause 4 of the Naval Defence (Wages Employees) Determination and Clause 5 of the Naval Defence (Salaried Staff) Determination in respect of Navy Office only; delegations by the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act in respect of Navy Office and Air Office; appointment by the Permanent Head as a member of the Naval Board and the Air Board.

ILO Convention No. 100 Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon nodce: (1) Which countries have ratified or acceded to ILO Convendon 100 which relates to equal remuneration. (2) What was the date of each ratification or accession. (3) Does the Government intend to ratify this Convention; if so when.",124
396,Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,"The answer to the right honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) ILO Convendon No 100-Equa l Remuneration, 1951 and (2) has been ratified by 80 ILO. The countries and dates of ratification are: Country Ratification Afghanistan 22 August 1969 Albania 3 June 1957 Algeria 19 October 1962 Argentina 24 September 1956 Austria 29 October 1953 Belgium 23 May 1952 Bolivia 15 November 1973 Brazil 25 April 1956 Bulgaria 7 November 1955 Byelorussia 21 August 1956 Cameroon 25 May 1970 Canada 16 November 1972 Central African Republic . 9 June 1964 Chad 29 March 1966 Chile 20 September 1971 China *1 May 1958 Columbia 7 June 1963 Costa Rica 2 June 1960 Cuba 13 January 1960 Czechoslovakia . . . . 30 October 1957 Dahomey 16 May 1968 Denmark 22 June 1960 Dominican Republic . . 22 September 1953 Ecuador 11 March 1957 Egypt 26 July 1960 Finland 14 January 1963 France 10 March 1953 Gabon 13 June 1961 Federal Republic of Germany 8 June 1956 Ghana 14 March 1968 Guatemala 2 July 1961 Republic of Guinea . . . 11 August 1967 Haiti 4 March 1958 Honduras 9 August 1956 Hungary 8 June 1956 Iceland 17 February 1958 India 25 September 1958 Indonesia 11 August 1958 Iran 10 June 1972 Iraq 28 August 1963 Israel 9 June 1965 Italy 8 June 1956 Ivory Coast 5 May 1961 Japan 24 August 1967 Jordan 22 September 1966 Date of Country Ratification (Question No. 564) Libya 20 June 1962 Luxembourg 23 August 1967 Malagasy Republic . . . 10 August 1962 Malawi 22 March 1965 Republic of MaU . . . 12 July 1968 Mexico 23 August 1952 Mongolia 3 June 1969 Netherlands 16 June 1971 Nicaragua 31 October 1967 Niger 9 August 1966 Nigeria 8 May 1974 Norway 24 September 1954 Panama 3 June 1958 Paraguay 24 June 1964 of the 125 member States of the Peru 1 February 1960 Philippines 29 December 1953 Date of Poland 25 October 1954 Portugal 20 February 1967 Rumania 28 May 1957 Senegal 22 October 1962 Sierra Leone 15 November 1968 Spain 6 November 1967 Sudan 22 October 1970 Sweden 20 June 1962 Switzerland 25 October 1972 Syrian Arab Republic . . 7 June 1957 Tunisia II October 1968 Turkey 19 July 1967 Ukrainian S.S.R. . . . 10 August 1956 USSR 30 April 1956 United Kingdom . . . 15 June 1971 Upper Volta 30 June 1969 Yugoslavia 21 May 1952 Zaire 16 June 1969 Zambia 20 June 1972 * At the time of ratification, Taiwan represented China in the ILO. (3) The Australian Government intends to ratify ILO Convention No. 100 at the earliest possible opportunity. Federal law and practice are in compliance with the provisions of the Convention and I am advised that 5 States have agreed to ratification. The situation in the remaining State is that my Department is in contact with the relevant State authorities as to several aspects of State law and practice with a view to the early clarification of that State's position regarding ratification. I might add that I am gratified by the right honourable member's recent interest in the ratification of this most important Convention which was first adopted in 1951. I would point out that the Liberal and Country Parties were in government for 21 years following the adoption of this Convention-indee d for some ume the right honourable member himself was the Minister responsible-bu t did not ratify it. This Government has taken seriously its obligations towards the ILO, particularly in relation to Conventions dealing, as does Convention No. 100, with basic human rights. This attitude is reflected in the substantial progress which has been made towards ratification of this Convention since the present Government came to office. Australian Capital Territory Housing: Inter-departmental Committee Mr Snedden asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon nodce: (1) Is the Inter-departmental Committee on Australian Capital Territory housing policy still in operadon. (2) Has it produced reports for the Government. (3) If so, what are the reports and when were they presented to the Government. (4) If not, is it expected reports will be produced. (5) Will he make the reports available.",125
397,Mr BRYANT ,"The answer to therighthonourdetermine able member's quesdon is as foUows: (1) There is an inter-departmental committee examines matters related to Australian Capital Territory housing. (2) and (3) No. The committee has drafted a report but it has not been finalised. (4) The committee is expected to offer advice to the Minister on aspects of housing. (5) Each matter will be looked at on its merits. Mr Berinson asked the Mmister for Educadon, upon nouce: (1) What was the date of the last calculation of average costs in State primary and secondary schools, and the average costs at that time in respect of each State. (2) Is it possible to estimate the approximate current at each level in each State; and if so, what are the details.",126
398,Mr BEAZLEY ,"The answer to the member's quesdon is as foUows: (1) The last calculation of this December 1973, in respect of the recurrent expenditure estiSub-section mates provided by six States and two Territories for the financial year 1973-74. The national averagefigures(to the nearest dollar) calculated from these per primary pupil and $640 per secondary pupil. I am unable to provide separatefiguresfor each State. The States made their data available solely for the purpose of enabling national averages to be calculated, and on the condition that separate State averages would not be released. (2) My Department will repeat the calculation 1974-75 after the Commonwealth and State budgets have been brought down. Australian Capital Territory Legislative Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital employed Territory, upon nouce: (1) Is it a fact that self-government for tal Territory means that ratepayers the municipal account the costs associated with the running of a Legislative Assembly.

(Question No. 580) (3) In view of the concern expressed by many Canberra people, will he undertake to hold a referendum to enable the electors of the Territory to indicate whether they are in favour of self-government.",126
399,Mr BRYANT ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) No. The apportioning of costs as between municipal and territorial revenues will depend on the ultimate functions of the Legislative Assembly. (2) It will not be possible to estimate the costs of the Legislative Assembly until the powers that it will exercise become clear. The Government has reiterated that it would not the powers of the Legislative Assembly in advance of the Government's consideration of the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory on selfwhich government and relatedfinancialmatters. (3) I will await the report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory on self-government and related financial matters before considering the need for such action. Industrial Inspectors (Question No. 600) Mr Malcolm Fraser asked the Minister for State Schools: Costs Labor and Immigration, upon notice: (1) How many people has he approved as Industrial (Question No. 596) Inspectors. (2) What is the name and what are the qualifications of each appointee. Mr Clyde Camerson-The answer to the what were honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) and (2) The Conciliation and Arbitration Act costs 1904-1973 provides in sub-section (2) of Section 125 that 'the Minister may appoint a person to be an Inspector for the honourable purposes of this Act.' I have not, to thistime,made any appointments under this kind was undertaken in provision. (2A) of the Act provides amongst other things, that an officer of the Public Service who occupies and office of Inspector in the Department is an Inspector for the purestimates were $379 poses of the Act. The Australian Arbitration Inspectorate is being substantially expanded to provide a more satisfactory service. As part of this process 46 persons have been appointed or transferred to the position of Inspector within the Australian Public Service. These appointments were made under the Public for Service Act and did not require my approval.

400,Mr WHITLAM ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) and (2)1 refer the honourable member to my answer 3 to an earlier related question (Question No. 2, Hansard, 7 and allowances, March 1973, page 351). Kingston: Proposed Multi-storey Flat Project Services Mr Garland asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: (1) Is the proposed multi-storeyflatprojea in Kingston by Hooker Home Units Pty Ltd now in doubt. (2) If so, is the reason because of the Government's policy of rent evaluadon and/or value added tax on re-development projects. (3) Does the Government consider that this projea is desirable and the additional accommodation it would provide likely to help alleviate the shortage of accommodation in Canberra. (4) Will he review existing policies with a view to encouraging provision of accommodation in Canberra. (5) Is the present situation modation Canberra has ever known. (6) Is it pan of existing policy for the Government to take over this land concerned; if so, is this likely to be the pattern in future.",126
401,Mr BRYANT ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Approval has been given to a scheme of development subject to certain conditions. As far as I am aware the company has not yet reached a decision in the matter. (3) The project is in accordance with a decision made by the previous Government to permit but not actively encourage redevelopment in Kingston. It would provide additional accommodauon but this could equally well be provided on other sites recently offered for lease for medium density housing in which limited or no interest has been shown by private developers. (4) Policies are continually under review. Under present arrangements leases for all forms of residential development are available at very reasonable prices. (5) No. (6) The Government has no current plans to acquire residential land in Kingston or other pans of Canberra purely for redevelopment purposes. Carnarvon-Space Tracking Station Mr Street asked the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, upon notice: What are the Government's plans for the future of the space tracking station at Carnarvon, Western Australia. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: The present plan for operational work at Carnarvon is to continue the phasing out of activities, which as announced in February 1973 began early this year. By 5 October 1974 the tracking staff will have been reduced to one team and the total staff, currently a little less than reduced to about SO. The single team will be retained until 22 December 1974 or the launch of Helios, whichever is the sooner. Tracking and data handling equipment is being removed concurrently with the phase-down of operations and most of it is being reallocated to other NASA stations. The buildings and service facilities will be almost available to the Australian Government. and Property which will be responsible for the reallocation of the land, buildings and service facilities, has (Question No. 684) their possible future use under consideration. The Depanment of Manufacturing Industry is in continuous liaison with NASA on the phase-down, with a view to minimising its effect on the Carnarvon community. Island Lagoon-Trackin g Station (Question No. 702) Mr Street asked the Minister for Manufacturing Industry, upon notice: (1) Has the offer by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to hand over the Island Lagoon tracking station been rejected by the Australian Government. the worse shortage of accom(2) If so, has this rejection been described by senior research scientists as a short-sighted move which is a blow to Australian space researchers and to the cause of fundamental research. (3) What has happened to the 85ft radiotelescope at Island Lagoon. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, the offer by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to hand over the antenna and some associated equipment and the buildings and services at the Island Lagoon tracking station was declined in September 1973. The reason for declining the offer was that the predicted level of Australian use would not have justified the cost of equipping the antenna for radio astronomy and maintaining the facility. (2) Such a statement was reponed in the Adelaide Advertiser of 10 October 1973. It was natural that the dismantling of the antenna should cause concern. However, it is pertinent to draw attention to the fact that facilities superior in many respects to those which were located at Island Lagoon exist at the NA'SA tracking stations in the Australian Capital Territory and are available for use by Australia. Over the past twelve months only two Australian scientists have used the antenna in the Australian Capital Territory wereas many more users could be accommodated. The costs to the users (Question No. 701) are small and certainly insignificant compared with prorata sharing of the costs which would have been involved at Island Lagoon.

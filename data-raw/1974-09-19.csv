NA,should be based on his or her capacity to pay-tha t,17

NA,relative to average earnings so that today it is about,17
NA,20 per cent of its value in 1949.,17
NA,The Interim Report of the Australian Government's,17

NA,protection for the human,18

NA,INDIA'S NUCLEAR TEST,19
Mr DRURY, I ask the Prime Minister,19
NA,whether the Government has received details of,19
NA,the nuclear bomb explosion testing reported to,19
NA,have taken place in India about 3 months ago. As,19
NA,the success of the nuclear non-proliferation,19
NA,treaty depends on the effective containment,19
NA,"nuclear testing, I ask whether Australia has",19
NA,any protest.,19
Mr WHITLAM,The Government has been immoral,19
NA,in touch with the Indian Government about the,19
NA,peaceful nuclear explosion which it conducted.,19
Mr ANTHONY ,What ! A peaceful one!,19
Mr WHITLAM,A n experimental explosion I,19
NA,to develop the peaceful use of nuclear energy.,19
NA,Needless to say the Govemment is disappointed,19
NA,that the Indian Government acted as it did.,19
NA,Australia is not the only government which is,19
NA,"disappointed that India so acted. In particular,",19
NA,we have been in touch also with the Canadian,19
NA,Government and the American Government General,19
NA,about i t I have been in personal correspondence,19
NA,with Mrs Gandhi about it. All I should add is that,19
NA,we do not believe that the long sustained effort,19
NA,which many nations have made to secure accept-,19
NA,ance for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has,19
NA,"been in any way assisted. It may, in fact, have",19
NA,been set back by the Indian experiment.,19
NA,MAINLINE CORPORATION,19
Mr JACOBI, I address my question to the people,19
NA,Minister representing the Attorney-General. It,19
NA,in relation to the Mainline Corporation.,19
NA,"Minister aware of reports that Mr R. T. Baker,",19
NA,"Managing Director of Mainline Corporation, has",19
NA,been involved with the Endurance Mining Co.,19
NA,which has been the subject of investigation,19
NA,the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Comset,19
NA,mission? Is it a fact that the report of the,19
NA,mission has been suppressed? Will the Minister,19
NA,request the Attorney-General to obtain a copy of,19
NA,"the report, and will he further take steps to",19
NA,ensure that the report is made public?,19
Mr ENDERBY, I have seen reports such as capital,19
NA,have been referred to by the honourable,19
NA,member. I tliink it would not be proper to make,19
NA,"comment on them at this stage, but one can",19
NA,be concerned about the lessons that can be,19
NA,drawn from a situation such as was revealed by,19
NA,"the Mainline incident. As was pointed out, I",19
NA,"think by the Prime Minister yesterday, in a",19
NA,"speech he made in this House, some of the great-",19
NA,"est corporations, some of the most eminent and",19
NA,highly placed businessmen in Australia-,19
Mr WHITLAM ,Insuranc e companies and,19
NA,banks.,19
Mr ENDERBY,Insuranc e companies and,19
NA,"people, whose solvency and liquidity is just not in",19
NA,"issue and never could be in issue, for reasons of",19
NA,achieving their purposes put together a corporate,19
NA,device to extend and further those purposes.,19
NA,of When the corporate device failed to serve the,19
NA,"made purpose to their convenience, they allowed to",19
NA,happen what did happen. I beheve it can only be,19
NA,thought and said that there is something quite,19
NA,about corporate behaviour or the use of,19
NA,the corporate screen-th e limited liability com-,19
NA,pany-i n that way when it brings such hardship,19
NA,on so many people. So far as the direct aspect of,19
NA,"the honourable member's question is concerned,",19
NA,do not know whether the report was suppressed,19
NA,"or not, but certainly it is my belief that it was",19
NA,never made public. 'Suppression' seems to be a,19
NA,fair comment and I believe that such reports,19
NA,should be released and made public so that the,19
NA,public themselves can be better protected. I will,19
NA,be happy to communicate with the Attorney-,19
NA,and put a strong suggestion to him along,19
NA,the lines put by the honourable member.,19
NA,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,19
Mr STREET,My question is directed to the,19
NA,Treasurer. When a farm property passes in direct,19
NA,"succession to children or a surviving spouse, will",19
NA,the person or persons to whom the property is,19
NA,assigned be Uable for capital gains tax in ad-,19
NA,dition to estate and probate duties? I f such,19
NA,"are liable, will the amount of capital gains",19
NA,is tax levied be allowed as a deduction in calculat-,19
NA,Is the ing estate and probate duties?,19
Mr CREAN,Th e other evening when this,19
NA,"matter was mentioned in the Budget Speech, I",19
NA,by indicated that a memorandum was available that,19
NA,out in broad detail some of these problems. I,19
NA,Comthink the honourable member will understand,19
NA,that these are matters of some complexity. As for,19
NA,"as farm property is concerned, I hope he will ap-",19
NA,preciate the fact that valuation day was on Bud-,19
NA,"get day. I doubt, listening to the whingeing of",19
NA,"farmers, whether any of them anticipate great",19
NA,gains on their properties in the immediate,19
NA,"future, but I would suggest that when the",19
NA,relevant Bill is introduced somewhat later in the,19
NA,only session these matters will be dealt with.,19
NA,Mr Snedden-Wha t is your intention? Surely,19
NA,you must be able to say whether capital gains tax,19
NA,will be deducted from the value of the property.,19
Mr CREAN, I am not like the Leader of the,20
NA,"Opposition, who makes statements with pre-",20
NA,cision in areas where you cannot be precise. I,20
NA,think the honourable member for Corangamite,20
NA,will acknowledge that he scarcely asked what,20
NA,might be called a precise question.,20
NA,"Mr Snedden-I raise a point of order, Mr",20
NA,Speaker. If the Treasurer did not appreciate that,20
NA,"the question was precise, perhaps the honourable",20
NA,member for Corangamite could re-ask the ques-,20
NA,tion so that the Treasurer can hear that it is,20
NA,cise question.,20
Mr CREAN,I would be happy if that were,20
NA,done.,20
Mr STREET," Mr Speaker, I asked: When a",20
NA,farm property passes in direct succession to chil-,20
NA,"dren or a surviving spouse, will the person or per-",20
NA,sons to whom the property is assigned be liable,20
NA,for capital gains tax in addition to estate and pro-,20
NA,"bate duties? I f such people are liable, will the",20
NA,amount of capital gains tax levied be allowed as,20
NA,a deduction in calculating estate and probate,20
NA,duties?,20
Dr FORBES ,Eve n I can understand it.,20
Mr CREAN,I t must be terribly simple. All I,20
NA,am suggesting is that the question is not as simple,20
NA,as that. The capital gains tax would not be pay-,20
NA,able by the person to whom the property was,20
NA,assigned; it would be paid by the person who,20
NA,presumably had died.,20
NA,Mr Snedden-Ho w could a person who has,20
NA,died pay tax?,20
Mr CREAN,Apparently honourable,20
NA,members oppositefindthis subject to be a matter,20
NA,of jest. I would submit with all respect that the,20
NA,Leader of the Opposition knows nothing what-,20
NA,"ever about the matter. As has been indicated, I",20
NA,have merely shown in broad outline what the,20
NA,situation will be. There are going to be some,20
NA,difficulties administratively.,20
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ," Mr Speaker, on a point",20
NA,"of order: Would it be possible, with the permis-",20
NA,"sion of the Treasurer, for the question to be",20
NA,redirected to the Minister for Overseas Trade?,20
Mr SPEAKER,Order! No point of order is,20
NA,involved.,20
Mr CREAN,I took it that when the honour-,20
NA,"able member for Corangamite, whom I respect,",20
NA,asked the question he asked it seriously. I cannot,20
NA,say that I appreciate the tactics of either the,20
NA,Leader of the Opposition or the honourable,20
NA,member for Wannon in relation to my attempt to,20
NA,answer the question. All I am suggesting is that it,20
NA,is not easy to be precise about the matter. The,20
NA,honourable gentleman referred to a property,20
NA,which had been assigned. I am not quite sure,20
NA,when the assignation took place. Then he refer-,20
NA,"red to probate, which implies the death of some",20
NA,party.,20
Dr FORBES ,Estat e duty.,20
Mr CREAN,"Or estate duty, but not gift duty.",20
NA,The honourable member for Corangamite did,20
NA,not say gift duty; he said estate duty. So at least,20
NA,there has been the death of a party. I am not like,20
NA,a prethe honourable member for Barker; I do not,20
NA,think it is quite as simple as that. From what the,20
NA,honourable member for Corangamite said I am,20
NA,not clear who assigned the farm to whom and at,20
NA,what stage. With all respect I would suggest that,20
NA,it is the sort of question on which the honourable,20
NA,member could have given me some notice or,20
NA,which he could have placed on notice so that I,20
NA,could give him a much more precise reply.,20
NA,Mr Snedden-Bu t you must know whether any,20
NA,capital gains tax paid is deductible.,20
Mr SPEAKER,Order! Interjections are out,20
NA,of order. The question has been asked by the,20
NA,honourable member for Corangamite.,20
Mr CREAN,"Capita l gains tax, if one wants",20
NA,"simplicity, is payable on any realised gain from",20
NA,18 September. I am suggesting that the matter is,20
NA,not clear-a t least it is not clear to me. I may be,20
NA,"duller than most, and maybe it is my understand-",20
NA,ing rather than his phrasing that has caused the,20
NA,"difficulty, but from the question asked by the",20
NA,"honourable member for Corangamite, it is not",20
NA,clear to me at what point and in whose hands the,20
NA,capital gain is supposed to have crystallised. The,20
NA,honourable gentleman went on further to talk,20
NA,"about an estate duty, presumably also in relation",20
NA,to the same capital gain. I must say that I am not,20
NA,clear from the question what I am being asked.,20
NA,COMMUNIST PARTY OF AUSTRALIA,20
Mr ANTHONY,I ask the Prime Minister,20
NA,What action has he or his Government taken in,20
NA,response to the announcement by the President,20
NA,"of the Communist Party of Australia, Mr",20
NA,"Mundey, that the Communist Party is planning a",20
NA,national strike next year? Is a close watch being,20
NA,made ofthe Party's activities?,20
Mr WHITLAM,M y colleagues and I gave,20
NA,the declaration as much attention as it deserved.,20
NA,The communist parties-ther e are about 3 in,20
NA,AustraUa at the moment-hav e never been so,20
NA,poUticaUy insignificant and we beUeve that the,20
NA,trade union movement has never been in better,20
NA,hands.,20
NA,HOUSING INDUSTRY ACTIVITY,21
Mr REYNOLDS,Ha s the attention of the,21
NA,Minister for Housing and Construction been,21
NA,NA,21
NA,the Housing Industry Association that there is a,21
NA,serious downturn in activities in the building,21
NA,industry? Does the Minister's assessment of the,21
NA,situation coincide with that of this gentleman?,21
Mr LES JOHNSON,I have seen the state-,21
NA,NA,21
NA,enough to send it to me together with a personal,21
NA,"letter, which I appreciated. He contended that",21
NA,"there is a serious downturn, as the honourable",21
NA,gentleman suggested. In fact he has been,21
NA,contending that for a longtime-virtually since,21
NA,this Government came into office. There is a,21
NA,tendency for people to project such dire develop-,21
NA,ments and consequences for the building indus-,21
NA,try prematurely. The facts ofthe matter are that,21
NA,we have just recently concluded afinancialyear,21
NA,in which more houses were built than have ever,21
NA,been built before in one year in Australia's his-,21
NA,"tory. That is the fact of the matter. Indeed, the",21
NA,first 18 months of this Government's period of,21
NA,office have been responsible for a very great out-,21
NA,put ofhouses.,21
NA,"Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, the Minister",21
NA,should make a statement about this matter after,21
NA,question time. We would be quite prepared to,21
NA,give him leave to make a statement. Why should,21
NA,he take up question time with false propaganda?,21
Mr SPEAKER,I have repeatedly made,21
NA,appeals in this House for questions and also,21
NA,answers to be shortened. I ask the Minister to be,21
NA,as brief as possible in his answer.,21
Mr LES JOHNSON,It is very difficult to be,21
NA,very brief and give a meaningful answer on this,21
NA,matter. I shall certainly make it as brief as I can. I,21
NA,can understand the honourable gentleman's sen-,21
NA,sitivity. We could take a great range of figures,21
NA,"under various headings-approvals , commence-",21
NA,"ments, houses under construction and comple-",21
NA,tions-an d under every one of those headings the,21
NA,performance of this Government is superior to,21
NA,that of our predecessors. This is why the honour-,21
NA,able gentleman does not like to hear too many,21
NA,"facts. Just in regard to completions, in the finan-",21
NA,cial year 1973-74 under this Government,21
NA,"153,000 houses were completed. In the previous",21
NA,"year under the previous Government, 143,000",21
NA,houses were completed.,21
NA,I believe there is a downturn in the building,21
NA,industry. The Government believes that this is,21
NA,the situation. As a result steps have been taken,21
NA,stimulate the industry with massive injections,21
NA,funds. This has been done firstly through the,21
NA,Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. It,21
NA,has been done certainly in respect of Defence,21
NA,"Service, Aboriginal housing, housing in the Ter-",21
NA,"ritories, aged persons' housing and in many",21
NA,"other ways, including the proposal to establish a",21
NA,new housing development corporation. Many,21
NA,initiatives are being taken by this Government to,21
NA,meet the situation as described b y -,21
NA,"Mr Snedden- Mr Speaker, clearly the Minis-",21
NA,ter is defying your ruling to keep answers short. I,21
NA,said that he could have leave to make a state-,21
NA,ment. He can speak for an hour i f he wants to,21
NA,after question time.,21
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I would remind the,21
NA,Leader of the Opposition that I did not give a rul-,21
NA,ing but made a request. No Speaker has had the,21
NA,power to ask anyone answering a question to ter-,21
NA,minate that answer. I can only appeal to the Min-,21
NA,ister to keep his answer as brief as possible. I,21
NA,again appeal to the Minister for Housing and,21
NA,Construction to keep his answer as brief as poss-,21
NA,ible and to terminate it as quickly as he can.,21
Mr LES JOHNSON,"As is my custom, Mr",21
NA,"Speaker, I will be very pleased to do so. Finally, I",21
NA,draw attention to the announcement made by,21
NA,the Treasurer to the effect that bank lending will,21
NA,be eased as a result ofthe proposed change in the,21
NA,60-40 ratio which I understand will release some,21
NA,"$ 1,200m for home lending over the long term",21
NA,and that in the shorter term still more money will,21
NA,be made available by the reduction from 10 per,21
NA,cent to TA per cent of funds required to be held,21
NA,by the Reserve Bank of Australia. So I can see,21
NA,some stimulation coming through these initia-,21
NA,tives. If necessary the new housing corporation,21
NA,will have the facility to inject more funds to sus-,21
NA,tain the buoyancy of the housing industry.,21
NA,PORT OF NEWCASTLE,21
Mr OKEEFE ,Ca n the Minister for,21
NA,Transport tell me whether there has been a con-,21
NA,siderable and unreasonable delay in loading and,21
NA,unloading ships and tankers in the port of New-,21
NA,castle? Has this been caused by strike action of,21
NA,key unions involved? Is it a fact that as a result of,21
NA,this action transport and industry in northern,21
NA,New South Wales have been paralysed through,21
NA,"lack of fuel, and valuable export income from",21
NA,grain and other produce has been threatened?,21
NA,What future action do the Minister and the,21
NA,Government intend to take to improve the turn-,21
NA,round of shipping in the port of Newcastle?,21
Mr CHARLES JONES,I have made the,21
NA,to statement on numerous occasions that the Aus-,21
NA,of tralian Government is prepared to accept re-,21
NA,sponsibility for the operation of Australia's ports.,21
NA,If the honourable gentleman refers his question,22
NA,to his own Party which is in government in New,22
NA,South Wales and which is completely and totally,22
NA,responsible for the operations of port activity in,22
NA,Newcastle and in every other port in New South,22
NA,Wales he might get his answer. Until such time,22
NA,as the New South Wales Government is pre-,22
NA,pared to transfer its responsibility to this,22
NA,ment I am afraid that it will be responsible for,22
NA,the turnround of ships and the operation of the,22
NA,ports.,22
NA,EDUCATION: NON-GOVERNMENT,22
Mr LUCHETTI,Ha s the attention of the,22
NA,Minister for Education been directed to criticism,22
NA,of the Australian Government in respect of non-,22
NA,government schools and charges of discrimi-,22
NA,nation which should be answered? Are these,22
NA,charges vahd and will the Minister make a state-,22
NA,ment in reply to the criticism?,22
Mr BEAZLEY,I n the lastfinancialyear the,22
NA,Australian Government's expenditure on non-,22
NA,government schools was $70m. In the estimates,22
NA,of the grants to the States-an,22
NA,which grants are made to non-government,22
NA,schools-th e expenditure for this financial year is,22
NA,"$120m. This is a rise of $50m, which is an",22
NA,way of discriminating against these schools. In,22
NA,addition there is $20m unallocated as between,22
NA,govemment and non-govemment schools in this,22
NA,nnanciai year compared with $2m in the,22
NA,nnanciai year- a tenfold increase. The amount,22
NA,going to either sector will depend very,22
NA,upon innovations. There is also another impor-,22
NA,tant non-government sector of educationdraw,22
NA,mission schools. In the last financial year the,22
NA,"grants to them were $295,000. In",22
NA,"year they will be $1,282,000. The honourable",22
NA,member making these criticisms was burking the,22
NA,"issue, but I do not want to accuse him of modelters",22
NA,"ling liimself on his hero, Edmund Burke.",22
NA,GEORGI ERMOLENKO,22
Mr KILLEN, I address my question to the,22
NA,Prime Minister. I ask the honourable gentleman:,22
NA,Poes he hold the belief that Ministers in his,22
NA,Government are bound by the rule of law and,22
NA,obliged to respect the processes of the law? If,22
NA,"honourable gentleman holds that belief, what",22
NA,explanation is forthcoming to explain why a,22
NA,"son, namely Georgi Ermolenko, was taken out of",22
NA,the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Western,22
NA,AustraUa when habeas corpus proceedings,22
NA,"before that Court, and Ministers knew it?",22
Mr WHITLAM,As to the first part of the,22
NA,"question, yes, of course I hold that beUef.",22
NA,"the second part, this matter was very fully",22
NA,debated in the Senate yesterday and a motion ex-,22
NA,pressing the view of the questioner was not car-,22
NA,ried. The situation is that the Western AustraUan,22
NA,Supreme Court- I forget all the details-clearl y,22
NA,could take any action it saw fit against any per-,22
NA,"son in Australia, including an Australian",22
NA,GovernGovernment Minister. The Supreme Court of,22
NA,Western AustraUa has not seen fit to take such,22
NA,action.,22
NA,MAINLINE CORPORATION,22
Mr INNES,I s the Minister for Housing and,22
NA,"SCHOOLS Construction aware of claims by Mr R. C. Baker,",22
NA,"Managing Director of the Mainline Corporation,",22
NA,that the Government did not try to save the Cor-,22
NA,poration because the Government is opposed to,22
NA,free enterprise?,22
Mr LES JOHNSON,I saw the statement. I,22
NA,resent it because the facts are-,22
Mr LUSHER ," I take the point of order, Mr",22
NA,Speaker. The question asked requires a yes or no,22
NA,answer. The question was whether a statement,22
NA,d that is the way in was made.,22
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,22
NA,gentleman will resume his seat. A Minister may,22
NA,odd answer a question in whatever way he chooses.,22
Mr LES JOHNSON,The statement is,22
NA,"resented because a number of Ministers, includ-",22
NA,"ing the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minis-",22
NA,"last ter, the Minister for Urban and Regional",22
NA,Development and myself took a great interest in,22
NA,"much this matter. Some of them, with their-",22
Mr WENTWORTH ,"O n a point of order, Sir, I",22
NA,"attention to standing order 145 which is,",22
NA,"this financial very succinctly, reads:",22
NA,An answer shall be relevant to the question.,22
Mr SPEAKER,Order! All answers by Minis-,22
NA,must be relevant to the questions. I ask the,22
NA,Minister to keep to the relevancy of the question.,22
Mr LES JOHNSON,Not only those Minis-,22
NA,ters to whom I referred worked assiduously on,22
NA,this matter but also a number of departmental,22
NA,heads were concerned. The Government had a,22
NA,very great interest in trying to save this company.,22
NA,The view was taken that we should try to rescue,22
NA,"the the construction part of the company, but the",22
NA,accounts and other factual material relating to,22
NA,perthe company were kept in such an unintelligible,22
NA,way that it was very difficult to find the informa-,22
NA,tion we required to enable us to rescue the con-,22
NA,were struction part of the company. We made a,22
NA,number of proposals.,22
NA,"At one stage the receiver, Mr Jamieson, came",22
NA,As to to see me and in fact made an announcement to,22
NA,the effect that he would stave offthe date of the,23
NA,company's going into Uquidation so that the,23
NA,Government's good intent could be further,23
NA,examined and our efforts could proceed. We ac-,23
NA,tuaUy studied the prospect of making funds,23
NA,avaUable to sustain Mainline's construction,23
NA,mdustry. All that was offered to us was an open-,23
NA,ended proposition which no government could,23
NA,justify. I regard the statements made by Mr,23
NA,Baker as a very cruel Ubel in the circumstances,23
NA,where the Government made every possible en-,23
NA,deavour to bring about the satisfactory rescue,23
NA,operation. If his own affairs had been more con-,23
NA,ducive to the rescue of the company our efforts,23
NA,could have been successful.,23
NA,ACADEMIC SALARIES,23
Mr CONNOLLY,Di d the Special Minister,23
NA,of State issue a Press statement on academic,23
NA,salaries on 14 July last in which he stated that:,23
NA,. . . the Government had agreed that Mr Justice,23
NA,Campbell would undertake an interim review of salary,23
NA,of academic staff in universities.,23
NA,Did the Press release conclude with the foUowing,23
NA,statement:,23
NA,The Minister said that the Government expected to con-,23
NA,sider Judge Campbell's interim,23
NA,Budget discussion.,23
Mr SPEAKER,I remind the honourable,23
NA,gentleman that he is not permitted to quote from,23
NA,a newspaper report in asking a question.,23
Mr CONNOLLY,I t is a Ministerial Press,23
NA,release.,23
Mr SPEAKER,"WeU, who is going to sub-",23
NA,stantiate whether it is the correct statement,23
NA,made?,23
Mr CONNOLLY,I have the text in front of,23
NA,me.,23
Mr SPEAKER,Ver y well.,23
Mr CONNOLLY,Would the Minister advise,23
NA,the House why he and the Prime Minister failed,23
NA,to give Mr Justice Campbell specific terms of,23
NA,"reference in July last, thus effectively delaying",23
NA,the mquiry? Why did he promise to consider aca-,23
NA,demic salaries in the context of a pre-Budget dis-,23
NA,cussions if this was clearly not his intention? Is,23
NA,the interim inquiry presently considering aca-,23
NA,demic salaries? When does the Minister expect,23
NA,the report to be tabled in Parliament?,23
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,The significant factor and,23
NA,of the whole of the report of the Remuneration,23
NA,Tribunal is that it was disallowed in another,23
NA,House. No doubt the honourable member took,23
NA,part in a ballot in his own Party,23
NA,would do in relation to that disallowance. Nat-,23
NA,"uraUy, when the report was disallowed, Mr Jus-",23
NA,tice CampbeU felt it would be improper and in-,23
NA,appropriate to proceed with any determination,23
NA,without statutory support. The reason nothing,23
NA,has been done with respect to academic salaries,23
NA,is due directly to the activities ofthe Opposition.,23
NA,"It is because of that, as the honourable member",23
NA,"would know if he looked at today's notice paper,",23
NA,that we are to introduce a Bill to amend the,23
NA,"Remuneration Tribunal Act, which wUl allow for",23
NA,academic salaries to be so determined. I am very,23
NA,confident that if the Opposition wiU give its sup-,23
NA,port and the proposed legislation becomes law,23
NA,His Honour wUl then proceed with that interim,23
NA,determination.,23
NA,PROPOSED FUEL AND ENERGY,23
NA,LEGISLATION IN WESTERN,23
NA,AUSTRALIA,23
Mr BENNETT,My question is directed to,23
NA,levels the Minister for Manufacturing Industiy who,23
NA,represents the Attorney-General in this chamber.,23
NA,Is the Minister aware of the tragic situation in,23
NA,Western Australia with respect to the proposed,23
NA,provisions of the Fuel and Energy Bill now be-,23
NA,fore the Western Australian State Liberal,23
NA,report in the context of its,23
NA,"Government's Parliament which, it is alleged by",23
NA,"the Law Society of Western Australia, State poli-",23
NA,"ticians and community leaders in that State, will",23
NA,remove civil liberties of AustraUan citizens? WUl,23
NA,the Minister clarify how the provisions of this Bill,23
NA,affect the civil liberties of Australian citizens?,23
NA,Will the Minister clarify what protection is,23
NA,afforded the legal and civil rights of Australian,23
NA,citizens acting in Western AustraUa in disputes,23
NA,under direction by Federal organisations in,23
NA,respect of national decisions which cause the,23
NA,invoking of the penal provisions of that Fuel and,23
NA,Energy Bill? What protection can be offered to,23
NA,AustraUan citizens who go to Western AustraUa,23
NA,to carry out duties on behalf of a national body,23
NA,from the threat of the appUcation of the pro-,23
NA,visions of the West Australian Act arising from,23
NA,the duties which they perform?,23
Mr ENDERBY, I have had an expression of,23
NA,concern made by the CouncU of the Law Society,23
NA,of Western AustraUa brought to my notice by the,23
NA,"honourable member, and I thank him for it. It",23
NA,has also been brought to the attention of the,23
NA,Attorney-General. The facts seem to be that this,23
NA,proposed legislation would have very serious,23
NA,adverse effects on the whole question of civil,23
NA,liberties were it to become law. The time has not,23
NA,been available to enable it to be analysed or,23
NA,"studied in detail, but some aspects can be",23
NA,as to what it touched on briefly.,23
NA,"For example, the Bill is drafted in extremely",24
NA,wide and vague terms such as certainly would,24
NA,not survive close scrutiny in our Senate. In ad-,24
NA,"dition, it makes provision for inspections of",24
NA,premises without warrant. The questioning of,24
NA,persons is also provided for in it. It has certain,24
NA,unsavoury retrospective elements which would,24
NA,constitute an attack on civil liberties. If it,24
NA,law in its proposed form some acts done before,24
NA,the making of regulations would be rendered,24
NA,criminal subsequently. I understand that the Bill,24
NA,also contains provisions for declarations of states,24
NA,"of emergency. It has to be said, however, that",24
NA,"there is talk of amendments, so one can only",24
NA,hope that flexibility and good sense will prevail.,24
NA,"As far as national organisations are concerned,",24
NA,the honourable member's fears are quite correct,24
NA,in that those organisations would be caught by,24
NA,the provisions were they to become law. It should,24
NA,also be said that the proposed law would cer-,24
NA,tainly be in breach of many of the provisions of,24
NA,the international covenant on civil and political,24
NA,rights.,24
NA,ACCOMMODATION FOR THE AGED,24
Mr HEWSON,I ask the Minister for Social,24
NA,Security whether he has given any consideration,24
NA,to the present plight of committees of manage-,24
NA,ment of homes for the aged or institutions which,24
NA,are in the process of building home units for the,24
NA,aged. Is he aware that the upper cost Umit is,24
NA,preventing further units being built because of,24
NA,the inflationary tender prices being obtained and,24
NA,that the Umit is also making the increase of the,24
NA,government capital subsidy from $2 for $1 to $4,24
NA,for $1 of almost no benefit at this stage? Has the,24
NA,Minister made any decision to bring the upper,24
NA,cost subsidy Umit up to the reaUstic figure so that,24
NA,plans and specifications already tendered can,24
NA,"proceed? If so, what is that figure?",24
Mr HAYDEN, I wUl be even more emphatic,24
NA,that the movement of the subsidy from $2 for $1,24
NA,to $4 for $1 is of absolutely no benefit at this,24
NA,"stage, because it has not been introduced yet. I",24
NA,released a statement in Perth at the weekend,24
NA,indicating that the Government was considering,24
NA,these matters and that a working party from,24
NA,Treasury and the Department of Social Security,24
NA,was investigating the problems which were,24
NA,confronting voluntary agencies providing this,24
NA,sort of accommodation. When the report comes,24
NA,to hand- I hope it will be quite soon-th e,24
NA,Government can give consideration to the assess-,24
NA,ment that is presented and make a pokey de-,24
NA,cision then.,24
NA,ELECTORAL ACT,24
Mr RIORDAN,M y question is directed to,24
NA,the Minister for Services and Property. Has his,24
NA,attention been drawn to certain reports criticising,24
NA,proposed or suggested amendments to the Elec-,24
NA,toral Act deaUng with optional preferential vot-,24
NA,ing and redistribution of electorates? I ask the,24
NA,became Minister: Is there any substance in the alle-,24
NA,gations which have been made?,24
Mr DALY,I t is true that the Government,24
NA,proposes to announce shortly that a redistribu-,24
NA,tion of electorates wul take place and that there,24
NA,wUl also be proposals for the introduction of,24
NA,optional preferential voting. It is also true to say,24
NA,that the Leader of the Country Party has cri-,24
NA,ticised these proposals in a most unjustified way.,24
NA,"Dealing with redistribution of boundaries, the",24
NA,last redistribution took place in 1968. Another,24
NA,"one should have foUowed the census of 1971, but",24
NA,the Liberal-,24
Mr ANTHONY ,"I t should not. He is dishonest,",24
NA,this fellow.,24
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Leader of the,24
NA,Country Party wUl contain himself.,24
NA,Mr Katter-Why does he not tell the truth?,24
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,24
NA,member for Kennedy wUl withdraw that state-,24
NA,ment.,24
NA,Mr Katter- I withdraw the statement.,24
Mr DALY,Anothe r redistribution was due,24
NA,after the 1971 census but the Liberal-Country,24
NA,"Party, at the instigation of the Deputy Prime",24
NA,"Minister at that time, decided to sidestep the",24
NA,redistribution and even denied Western,24
NA,Australia the additional seat to which it was en-,24
NA,titled. Western AustraUa did not get that ad-,24
NA,ditional seat until Labor came into office. The,24
NA,situation is that nearly every electorate in,24
NA,"Australia is out of kilter. For instance, in New",24
NA,"South Wales, MitcheU has 83,000 on the roll and",24
NA,"Darling has 47,000; in Victoria, Diamond Valley",24
NA,"has 87,000 and Wimmera 49,000; in",24
NA,"Queensland, MCPherson has 91,000 and",24
NA,"Maranoa 47,000. Those figures give an indica-",24
NA,tion of the disparity that exists in electorates. Un-,24
NA,"doubtedly, because of the faUure of the previous",24
NA,"Government to take action in this regard, a redis-",24
NA,"tribution is a longtimeoverdue. I might say, in",24
NA,"answer to the Leader of the Country Party, that a",24
NA,redistribution commission is to be appointed.,24
NA,The commission wUl be appointed in accordance,24
NA,"with the Act, which has not been changed in",24
NA,respect of the appointment of commissioners,24
NA,since the Liberal-Country Party was in govern-,24
NA,ment. Men of the highest personal integrity will,24
NA,be appointed on the same basis and by the same,25
NA,methods as were adopted by the Liberal and,25
NA,Coimtry Parties. In these circumstances it is,25
NA,strange to hear the Leader of the Country Party,25
NA,rejecting the proposals before they have been,25
NA,announced. This only goes to show that the,25
NA,Country Party will go to any length to maintain,25
NA,the malapportionment of electorates in the,25
NA,interests of political survival irrespective of,25
NA,democratic principles.,25
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ," Mr Speaker, I rise on a",25
NA,point of order. There is a widespread under-,25
NA,standing that the Mimster already has been re-,25
NA,sponsible for draft maps being drawn and if that,25
NA,is so-,25
Mr SPEAKER,That is not a point of order.,25
NA,The honourable member willresumehis seat.,25
NA,Mr Nixon- I take a point of order. My point,25
NA,orderrelatesto the fact that on his return from,25
NA,Canada the Minister said what the boundaries,25
NA,were going to be.,25
Mr SPEAKER,The Chair is not in a position,25
NA,to know what is said by Ministers or their,25
NA,ments. No point of order is involved.,25
Mr DALY,Th e Leader ofthe Country Party,25
NA,would be better advised to inform the House,25
NA,how his Party perpetrated the greatest gerryvotes,25
NA,mander in history and elected in Queensland a,25
NA,Country Party Premier whose Party secured only,25
NA,19 per cent of the votes. He should do this,25
NA,instead of criticising. He could also explain,25
NA,the Liberal-Country Party Government in New,25
NA,South Wales has maintained itself in office by the,25
NA,gerrymandering of electorates based on the,25
NA,Queensland set-up. I turn now to,25
NA,optional preferential voting. The Leader of the,25
NA,Country Party quoted the case of Great Britain,25
NA,and gave certain figures. Great Britain has a,25
NA,past the post system.,25
Mr ANTHONY ,I t is the same as you are doing.,25
Mr DALY,"Ah, the same thing! Optional",25
NA,preferential voting means that a person will,25
NA,called upon to vote only for the number of,25
NA,didates for which there are vacancies in order,25
NA,"register a formal vote. However, if a person",25
NA,desires to vote for all candidates in order of,25
NA,preference he has that right. The proposal is not,25
NA,to change the system but to simplify the method,25
NA,"of voting. The Chief Austrahan Electoral Officer,",25
NA,"a man of the highest personal integrity, assures",25
NA,me that as compared with the present system this,25
NA,will not change the result of elections once in,25
NA,years. That is the answer direct to the Leader,25
NA,the Country Party.,25
NA,The Leader ofthe Country Party should know,25
NA,that between 1919 and 1931 tory governments,25
NA,which his predecessors supported had this sys-,25
NA,tem in Austraha for Senate elections. In 1958 his,25
NA,Government introduced it for the Advisory,25
NA,Council elections in the AustraUan Capital Terri-,25
NA,"tory, and it is still in force. In addition we have",25
NA,introduced this system for the AustraUan Capital,25
NA,Territory and Northern Territory Assembly elec-,25
NA,tions that are imminent. His Party never opposed,25
NA,the proposal. So what is the position? What is the,25
NA,purpose of this hillbilly stuff the Leader of the,25
NA,Country Party is putting to the Australian,25
NA,people?,25
NA,In the last Senate elections for this ParUament,25
NA,there were 73 candidates in New South Wales. In,25
NA,every State there were massive numbers of can-,25
NA,didates. The informal vote throughout AustraUa,25
NA,"of totalled about 800,000 or 10 per cent of the",25
NA,votes. So it is necessary for us to do something to,25
NA,make the voting method simpler. In New South,25
NA,"Wales there were 332,000 informal votes; in Vic-",25
NA,"toria, 230,000; in South AustraUa, 82,000; in",25
NA,"Western AustraUa, 60,000; in Tasmania, 26,000;",25
NA,"departand in Queensland, 65,000. Consequently",25
NA,almost 1 mUUon people had no say in what,25
NA,"government was elected, irrespective of their",25
NA,poUtical opinions. They were not uninteUigent,25
NA,people. Many intelUgent people cannot record,25
NA,for 73 candidates without making a mis-,25
NA,"take. The optional preferential method of voting,",25
NA,"far from being introduced to assist any party, is",25
NA,to make certain that by a simpUfied method of,25
NA,how voting every AustraUan willregistera vaUd and,25
NA,formal vote. The Labor Party seeks by aU its,25
NA,electoral proposals only to see that the candidate,25
NA,or Party that secures the majority of votes gets,25
NA,the question of the majority of seats.,25
NA,I can understand the ill-judged criticism ofthe,25
NA,first Leader of the Country Party. The whole history,25
NA,of his organisation is one of opposition to elec-,25
NA,toral reform. When in government he insisted on,25
NA,holding this portfoUo for his Government for the,25
NA,sole purpose of avoiding democratic elections,25
NA,be and majority rule. The Leader of the Country,25
NA,canParty and his Party have too many skeletons in,25
NA,to their poUtical cupboards on questions of elec-,25
NA,toral reform to be taken seriously. I believe that,25
NA,the AustraUan people agree that a simplified vot-,25
NA,ing method is essential in the interests of demo-,25
NA,"cratic elections, and that is precisely what the",25
NA,"Labor Party is endeavouring to do, both by",25
NA,means of redistribution and the simplification of,25
NA,the voting method. We aim to give the people a,25
NA,100 say in the government of their country and not,25
NA,of deny it to them as the Liberal and Country Par-,25
NA,ties have done for generations.,25
NA,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,26
Mr CREAN,I would like an opportumty to,26
NA,clarify my understanding of the question asked,26
NA,by the honourable member for Corangamite.,26
NA,Had he used the word 'inheritance' instead of,26
NA,the word 'assignation' I would have understood,26
NA,it better. But I now take the point that he made. I 1973.,26
NA,assure the honourable member that this matter is,26
NA,spelled out in paragraph 7 of the memorandum.,26
NA,Mr Bourchier-Hav e you not read it before?,26
Mr CREAN,"Yes, I have read it before. ParaJune 1974.",26
NA,graph 7 simply states that if capital gains tax is,26
NA,payable on death on the increase in value,26
NA,"assets, including a farm, then the amount so",26
NA,able by an executor is deductible from the value,26
NA,of the estate for estate duty purposes. That is,26
NA,spelled out in detail in paragraph 7.,26

NA,Ministerial Statement,27
Mr UREN ,Reid-Minister for Urban and,27
NA,Regional Development)-b y leave- I join with,27
NA,my coUeague the Minister for the Environment,27
NA,and Conservation (Dr Cass) in tabUng the report,27
NA,of the Committee of Inquiry into the National,27
NA,Estate.,27
NA,Before outlining to the House the noble con-,27
NA,cept of the National Estate which is enshrined in,27
NA,"the report, I want to express my personal pride",27
NA,and satisfaction in its contents. It was a concept,27
NA,which I devised and pubUcised in the days when,27
NA,I was the spokesman on the environment and,27
NA,urban and regional affairs for the Labor Party in,27
NA,opposition. During the years between 1969 and,27
NA,"1972,1 put particular stress on ^identifying the",27
NA,National Estate and promoting it as a key part of,27
NA,Labor Party poUcy. In the pohcy speech of the,27
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) in December,27
NA,"1972, he promised that a Labor Government",27
NA,would enhance and preserve the concept of the,27
NA,"national estate. As a Government, we have acted",27
NA,swiftly to discharge the mandate given to us to,27
NA,"identify, conserve and preserve the National Es-",27
NA,tate.,27
NA,"In April last year, Dr Cass and I announced",27
NA,the appointment of a Committee of Inquiry into,27
NA,"the National Estate, with Mr Justice Hope as",27
NA,Chairman. The other members of the Committee,27
NA,"were Reginald Walker, the Federal Executive",27
NA,Member of the National Trust; MUo Dunphy of,27
NA,the conservation groups; Judith Wright-,27
NA,"MCKinney, a poetess and a great environmen-",27
NA,"talist; Mr Len Webb, of the Commonwealth",27
NA,Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation;,27
NA,"Mr David Yencken, a progressive builder from",27
NA,"Melbourne; Mr Keith Vallance, a Tasmanian",27
NA,"businessman; and Judith Mary Brine, a univer-",27
NA,sity lecturer from South Australia.,27
NA,The Committee began its work at the end of,27
NA,May last year. It considered more than 650 sub-,27
NA,"missions from Government, community and pro-",27
NA,"fessional bodies, and from individuals.The Com-",27
NA,"mittee travelled widely, looking at important",27
NA,parts of our national heritage and so enriching its,27
NA,insights into the concept of the National Estate,27
NA,and how it should be identified and preserved.,27
NA,"Its report was received by us in April this year,",27
NA,and its findings and recommendations were,27
NA,announced by the Prime Minister at the end of,27
NA,April. Now the full report has been printed and,27
NA,we are glad to be able to put it before members,27
NA,of the Parliament. The central theme of the,27
NA,report on the National Estate is set out in this ex-,27
NA,tract from itsfindingsand recommendations:,27
NA,The Australian Government has inherited a National,27
NA,"Estate which has been downgraded, disregarded and",27
NA,neglected. All previous priorities accepted at vanous levels of,27
NA,Government and authority have been directed by a concept,27
NA,"that uncontrolled development, economic growth and",27
NA,"'progress', and the encouragement of private as against pub-",27
NA,"lic interest in land use, use of waters, and indeed in every",27
NA,"pan of the National Estate, was paramount",27
NA,The report goes on to confirm that this Govern-,27
NA,ment is the first Administration to make a com-,27
NA,mitment to charting the National Estate and con-,27
NA,"serving it, particularly for younger people and",27
NA,AustraUans of the future. I cannot stress too,27
NA,strongly that the Australian Government is,27
NA,determined that our National Estate wUl no,27
NA,longer be degraded and despoiled,27
NA,The Committee has devoted a great deal of,27
NA,work to defining with precision the things that,27
NA,make up the National Estate. It has opted for a,27
NA,very wide ranging definition of the National,27
NA,Estate which can be summed up in this way:,27
NA,Elements of such outstanding world value that,27
NA,"they need to be conserved, managed and pre-",27
NA,sented as part of the heritage of the world; el-,27
NA,ements of such outstanding national value that,27
NA,"they must be conserved, managed and presented",27
NA,as part of the nation as a whole; and elements of,27
NA,"such artistic, social, historical, cultural or other",27
NA,special value to the nation or any part of it that it,27
NA,"should be conserved, managed and presented for",27
NA,the benefit of the community as a whole. This,27
NA,very broad definition of the National Estate,27
NA,includes elements of remarkable diversity and,27
NA,richness. The range of the National Estate,27
NA,extends from great national parks and awesome,27
NA,rain forests to a simple stand of trees or patch of,27
NA,coastline. It includes the remaining treasures of,27
NA,our colonial architecture and such homely parts,27
NA,of the national heritage as paddlesteamers and,27
NA,even a Chinese joss house.,27
NA,A pleasing feature ofthe report is its rejection,27
NA,of the widely held notion that conservation and,27
NA,preservation of the environment are a 'middle,28
NA,class' issue. The Committee affirms this is just,28
NA,true and that preserving the National Estate con-,28
NA,cerns us all. It shatters once and for all the,28
NA,illusion that the national estate is the preserve,28
NA,the better-off members of the community. The,28
NA,forces which threaten our National Estate often,28
NA,bear most heavily on the less privileged. Poorer,28
NA,people suffer more intensely from the loss of,28
NA,"parkland, familiar city and country scapes, and",28
NA,even dwellings. Deprived commumty groups,28
NA,have not the same access as the wealthy to other,28
NA,sources of personal enjoyment and fulfilment.,28
NA,That is why it is often the less affluent who are,28
NA,most active in working to protect the best fea-,28
NA,tures of our heritage. That is why the trade union,28
NA,movement has been active in trying to protect,28
NA,and enhance our National Estate. The pillage,28
NA,and neglect of the National Estate diminishes us,28
NA,all in equal measure. I also want to make it plain,28
NA,that I seek the support of people of goodwill,28
NA,whatever their background in protecting the,28
NA,National Estate and passing it intact to future,28
NA,generations. We will work with all those who,28
NA,want to protect those parts of our heritage that,28
NA,have been created by man or nature and are,28
NA,unique or are things of beauty.,28
NA,I want to make it clear that the Government,28
NA,has not been idle while it waited for the report,28
NA,the Committee of Inquiry. In the last financial,28
NA,year more than $2m was provided to help the,28
NA,State governments and other organisations prestrive,28
NA,serve the National Estate. In the Budget now,28
NA,"fore the Parhament, for 1974-75, this has been",28
NA,lifted to $8m. We have also announced our,28
NA,intention to establish a National Heritage Comfirmly,28
NA,mission to administer our pohcy on the National,28
NA,Estate. This was one of the more important,28
NA,recommendations of the Committee. This Comment,28
NA,mission will be responsible to the Minister for the,28
NA,Environment and Conservation and myself. We,28
NA,expect that legislation to set up the Commission,28
NA,will be put to the ParUament in this session,28
NA,early in 1975. In the meantime a 17 member ing,28
NA,interim committee has been set up to help bridge,28
NA,the gap between the Committee of Inquiry and,28
NA,the proposed Heritage Commission. The Comthe,28
NA,mittee is headed by Mr David Yencken who perand,28
NA,formed valuable services as a member of the,28
NA,Committee of Inquiry.,28
NA,I refer honourable members to the attention,28
NA,given by the report to the role of the AustraUan,28
NA,Government in fostering the national estate.,28
NA,number of new roles have been,28
NA,Government. The Committee's broad recom-,28
NA,"not mendations cover land use planning, conser-",28
NA,vation and reservation techniques and the prin-,28
NA,ciples of national parks. They extend to the,28
NA,"of impact of mining, forestry and coastal develop-",28
NA,ment on the national estate. Thereportalso pro-,28
NA,poses a nationalregisterof sites of historic and,28
NA,"scientific interest, and measures to protect and",28
NA,preserve important Aboriginal sites. No future,28
NA,Government wUl be able to ignore the impact of,28
NA,the report and its impUcations for the careful,28
NA,planning of future pubUc poUcy to safeguard the,28
NA,national estate. The work of Mr Justice Hope and,28
NA,his Committee deserves the highest praise of this,28
NA,Parliament and aU Australians. We are also,28
NA,grateful for the help and co-operation given by,28
NA,"State and local government authorities, by a host",28
NA,"of voluntary organisations, and by hundreds of",28
NA,individuals. AU have helped in the great task of,28
NA,developing and refining the concept of the,28
NA,National Estate. The report of the Committee is,28
NA,a symbol of the great physical and cultural heri-,28
NA,tage we have been fortunate enough to inherit.,28
NA,Now we must act with firmness and vision to,28
NA,ensure that future generations wUl not lead their,28
NA,Uves satisfied with a National Estate which we,28
NA,have spoUt.,28
NA,"Finally, it gives me some personal pride that",28
NA,an idea drawn from my own plulosophy and per-,28
NA,"sonal feelings, and reflecting the ideals of great",28
NA,"of socialists of the tradition of WUliam Morris,",28
NA,should bear fruit in this noble concept and this,28
NA,fine report. In the spirit of the report we wiU,28
NA,to create and preserve things and places of,28
NA,begreat beauty for aU AustraUans and for the Aus-,28
NA,traUans that foUow us. Such a great sharing of,28
NA,beauty and culture among all of our people is,28
NA,based on the contents of this outstanding,28
NA,report. I urge honourable members to give it,28
NA,detaUed study and assure them that the Govern-,28
NA,will act positively on its recommendations.,28
Mr HUNT ,Gwydir)-b y leave- Iriseto wel-,28
NA,come the tabUng of this report. I am sure that all,28
NA,or honourable members wUl look forward to study-,28
NA,"it in depth. In passing, I take the word of the",28
NA,Minister for Urban and Regional Development,28
NA,( Mr Uren) that it was he who gave the lead to,28
NA,"AustraUan Labor Party, to the Government",28
NA,to the nation. It is certainly not a modest,28
NA,observation but one which could weU be true. If,28
NA,it is true aU credit must go to the Minister. The,28
NA,report is a monumental document and appears,28
NA,to be beautifuUy illustrated and is certainly,28
NA,printed and pubUshed in a manner that is not,28
NA,usuaUy evident in suchreports.I join the Minis-,28
NA,A ter in congratulating Mr Justice Hope and others,28
NA,suggested for the on the Committee.,28
NA,I am glad that the Government is acting to,29
NA,establish a National Heritage Commission. The,29
NA,National Estate report not only recognises the,29
NA,need for the preservation of historic buildings,29
NA,and things like the Chinese joss house that was,29
NA,"mentioned in the Minister's speech, but also the",29
NA,natural environment. I refer to the recommenda-,29
NA,tions in the land use planning section. I quote this,29
NA,pan so that it will be incorporated in Hansard.,29
NA,The Committee recommends:,29
NA,To protect and conserve the natural environment requires,29
NA,conservation to be part of the normal planning and develop-,29
NA,ment process. A proper land-use inventory and over-all,29
NA,"regional land-use plan, keyed in with the inventory,",29
NA,Therefore we recommend:,29
NA,"that the Australian Government give its full suppon to,",29
NA,and discuss with the States possible help to them in,29
NA,up procedures for land-use inventories and regional land-,29
NA,use planning.,29
NA,"Second, planners, designers, construcnon authorities and",29
NA,developers generally should accept the principles of'design,29
NA,with nature' and act accordingly. We recommend:,29
NA,that the Australian Government seek to ensure as far as,29
NA,possible that land-uses are planned and decided in har-,29
NA,mony with natural forces and conditions and not against,29
NA,them.,29
NA,I think that is probably one of the keys to the,29
NA,recommendations of the total report. I have felt,29
NA,for some time that too often in the environment,29
NA,protection field we have been treating the causes,29
NA,of abuse rather than trying to establish an,29
NA,tory so that proper land use decisions can be,29
NA,made. I do not think that any poUtical party can,29
NA,accept the blame for what has happened. I know ment.,29
NA,"that in New South Wales, for instance, after the",29
NA,last war it was the Australian Labor Party,29
NA,Government that introduced closer settlement to,29
NA,the western areas of New South Wales and gled,29
NA,carved up blocks of land that were far too small,29
NA,for adequate pastoral activities. We have seen,29
NA,great areas of western New South Wales virneglected.,29
NA,tually rendered a desert.,29
NA,It appears that several Departments have a,29
NA,sponsibility and also a responsibUity to Uaise,29
NA,with each other in order that many of these the,29
NA,recommendations can be achieved. One recomwe,29
NA,mendation that I think is worthy of note is the,29
NA,composition of the 17 member interim comtate.,29
NA,mittee. It is composed of Federal pubUc servants,29
NA,and other interested persons. If it is to exclude,29
NA,State public servants I think a great mistake,29
NA,being made. The report itself spends a lot of,29
NA,in deaUng with the constitutional constraints.,29
NA,quote a section of the report which states:,29
NA,"Some parts, and indeed imponant parts, of the",29
NA,"Estate are in the Territories, or, although within",29
NA,"are owned by the Commonwealth, but the greater pan",29
NA,National Estate is within the,29
NA,general legislative control ofthe States.,29
NA,So it would be a great pity i f the interim com-,29
NA,mittee did not have State Public Service,29
NA,representation. If we are to make any real impact,29
NA,on this problem we need the co-operation of the,29
NA,States.,29
NA,The Minister exalts his own socialist,29
NA,plulosophy and assumes that sociahsts have a,29
NA,monopoly of the concern for the National Estate.,29
NA,He quoted that great capitalist who had socialist,29
NA,"behefs, WUUam Morris. WUUam Morris had one",29
NA,great advantage in his writing days; he was writ-,29
NA,ing in a cosy provincial environment which had,29
NA,are vital. been man-made for more than 400 years. I make,29
NA,that significant statement because it was the,29
NA,desire of all political Parties in Australia and,29
NA,setting indeed ofthe AustraUan people after the last war,29
NA,to develop Australia at an undreamed-of pace.,29
Mr UREN ,Th e WUliam Morris I am talking,29
NA,about is an Englishman.,29
Mr HUNT, I know. I am not talking about an,29
NA,AustraUan. The WUUam Morris the Minister,29
NA,talked about was a very wealthy socialist and he,29
NA,Uved in an environment where 400 years of man-,29
NA,made effort enabled him to assume the sort of,29
NA,statements and writings that he was able to pro-,29
NA,duce. I relate this to the Australian scene. We,29
NA,have witnessed a great era of growth that has,29
NA,generated the wealth that has improved the,29
NA,invengeneral living standards of the Australian,29
NA,people. It is against that background that we can,29
NA,afford now to protect and conserve our environ-,29
NA,Perhaps one of the most unfortunate parts of,29
NA,the Minister's speech was that in which he sin-,29
NA,out a section of the report to quote. It states:,29
NA,The Australian Government has inherited a National Es-,29
NA,"tate which has been downgraded, disregarded and",29
NA,It is very easy to say these sorts of things. But,29
NA,what that report did not say was that the Aus-,29
NA,"retralian people, during this period of growth, had",29
NA,their Uving standards Ufted to equal the best in,29
NA,world. It is only because of that situation that,29
NA,can now turn our attention to preserving and,29
NA,conserving the environment and the national es-,29
NA,So let us keep our ideas in perspective. We,29
NA,should not hesitate to respect and protect our,29
NA,great national heritage for future generations.,29
NA,is This report and its recommendations should give,29
NA,time us the lead. We are one of the last developed,29
NA,I nations to have a large part of our environment,29
NA,left virtually in its natural state and it is up to all,29
NA,"National men and women, not just the sociahsts, to pre-",29
NA,"the States, serve as much of it as is economically and",29
NA,ofthe socially possible. That is the key to the whole ap-,29
NA,States and so is subject to the,29
NA,proach. There has to be a balance. I am sure that,29
NA,the implementation of the recommendations,30
NA,against that background of consideration will,30
NA,to the long-term benefit of the Austrahan people.,30

NA,Discussion of Matter of Public Importance,30
Mr SPEAKER,I have received a letter from levy,30
NA,the honourable member for Wannon ( Mr lected,30
NA,Malcolm Fraser) proposing that a definite matthe,30
NA,ter of pubhc importance be submitted to,30
NA,"House for discussion, namely:",30
NA,"The failure of the Government, in formulating",30
NA,of reference for the Royal Commission into alleged,30
NA,"nity payments involving maritime unions, to include:",30
NA,(1) Charges that the Minister for,30
NA,proved fhe indemnity payments 12 months ago.,30
NA,(2) The silence of the Minister for Labor and Immigra-,30
NA,tion and the Minister for Transport from 26,30
NA,early September when publicity was given to indem-,30
NA,nity payments.,30
NA,(3) The failure of bom Ministers to take appropriate,30
NA,action under the law.,30
NA,I call upon those members who approve of the,30
NA,proposed discussion to rise in their places.,30
NA,(More than the number of members required,30
NA,by the Standing Orders having risen in their,30
NA,places)-,30
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,Wannon) correspondent,30
NA,(11.12)-Thi s debate is taking place today,30
NA,cause ofthe Government's determination to,30
NA,the debate yesterday on the same matter. I say,30
NA,without any equivocation that,30
NA,"propriety in this Government, and if the Prime",30
NA,Minister ( Mr Whitlam) were concerned for the,30
NA,"name and integrity ofhis Government, he would",30
NA,widen the terms of reference ofthe Royal ComFederation-,30
NA,mission which is investigating alleged indemnity .,30
NA,payments involving maritime unions; he would,30
NA,give the Royal Commission an overriding man-,30
NA,date to pursue every aspect of this matter.,30
NA,Royal Commission should be permitted to examexplained,30
NA,ine every one of the unions that might be,30
NA,volved so that the good name of the Government,30
NA,and of the overwhelming bulk of the union,30
NA,movement can be cleared from the charges and state:,30
NA,the smell of the incident created by the aUeged,30
NA,activities of Mr EUiott and the Seamen's Union. corporate,30
NA,As part of that process of purging itself there or,30
NA,would be no honourable course open to the Min-,30
NA,ister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) other,30
NA,to offer to the Prime Minister his resignation,30
NA,which could be held in suspense until the matter,30
NA,"had been cleared, proved or disproved one",30
NA,or the other. But that is not the,30
NA,Govemment. That would not be the practice of,30
NA,this Minister who wiU try to cover this matter,30
NA,just as significantly as other matters have been states:,30
NA,covered up in other places. But I only suggest,30
NA,be that the matter will be pursued in one way or,30
NA,another and that one day the facts will become,30
NA,plain.,30
NA,Charges have been made by Mr EUiott against,30
NA,"the Minister, and the charges are very clear. He",30
NA,said that the Minister produced the idea of the,30
NA,on ships and the way in which it is being col-,30
NA,and that this came out of a discussion in,30
NA,Minister's office over a year ago. On the one,30
NA,the hand we have the word of the Minister who,30
NA,sought to deny that and the word of Mr EUiott,30
NA,the terms who said that that is what had happened. But,30
NA,indemthere is information and it is my understanding,30
NA,that Mr ElUott beUeves he can prove that charge,30
NA,Transport had apagainst the Minister.,30
NA,There is other circumstantial evidence to indi-,30
NA,July to cate that Mr EUiott is indeed correct. When ques-,30
NA,tioned on 5 September by James Ramsden of the,30
NA,'AustraUan Financial Review' the Minister said,30
NA,that in his office in that discussion with Mr ElUott,30
NA,he had liimself tentatively raised the idea. If he,30
NA,had tentatively raised the idea and admitted that,30
NA,much there starts to be circumstantial evidence,30
NA,in support of Mr ElUott's charge. But the Minis-,30
NA,ter's statements seem to be odd and contradic-,30
NA,"tory, because 5 days later in front of the same",30
NA,"on 10 September, in discussing",30
NA,bematters relating to the Waterside Workers Fed-,30
NA,"gag eration, the Ministerfirstof all said:",30
NA,"What I know has been going on, and I indicated to",30
NA,if there were any Charley Fitz-,30
NA,"For the uninitiated, the Minister was referring to",30
NA,Charley Fitzgibbon of the Waterside Workers,30
NA,. . that so far as I was concerned he has no risk of me,30
NA,"taking any action against him, or his union . . .",30
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I should like to,30
NA,"The remind the honourable member that, as I",30
NA,"yesterday, in my opimon the terms of",30

NA,nity payments 12 months ago.,31
NA,"Indemnity payments do not relate only, as you",31
NA,"very correctly said, to the maritime unions. The Elliott",31
NA,"terms of reference, as I hope you correctly say,",31
NA,cover the Waterside Workers Federation as well. paid,31
NA,Point No. 1 of my motion is that the Minister for and,31
NA,Transport had approved indemnity payments 12,31
NA,months ago and that this matter,31
NA,examined. You have ruled discussion on this,31
NA,"matter to be in order. The point that I was makIDepartment,",31
NA,"ing was that there is significant evidence in Mr Labor, aboutand",31
NA,Elliott's statement of the activities of the Seaalternative,31
NA,men's Union and in other pubUshed reports that,31
NA,the Minister had approved indemnity payments allow,31
NA,not only concerning the Seamen's Union but also,31
NA,concerning the Waterside Workers Federation.,31
NA,It is that point that I was seeking to demonstrate,31
NA,by tbis quotation and no other.,31
NA,The Minister there would indicate a knowlalternative.,31
NA,edge and an approval of what was happening,31
NA,the Waterside Workers Federation just as Mr,31
NA,EUiott claimed that he had approved what was,31
NA,happening in relation to the Seamen's Umon.,31
NA,But at a later point in the same interview the,31
NA,Minister said:,31
NA,"I repeat, I am unaware of any levies that have been",31
NA,That was about 3 minutes after he said that he,31
NA,had approved what in fact had been going on.,31
NA,The Minister has virtually condemned,31
NA,out ofhis own mouth. There is evidence from his,31
NA,own mouth that he has been involved and that,31
NA,he knew about these matters. He took no action,31
NA,and there was implicit approval therefore,31
NA,what was happening.,31
NA,That is thefirstpoint that I sought to demondeep for,31
NA,"strate. Then we have the question of the sUence wUd,",31
NA,not only of the Minister for Transport who is commission,31
NA,principally culpable in this matter but also of the which,31
NA,Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde ters,31
NA,Cameron). It needs to be pointed out that the for Transport.,31
NA,Minister for Transport chaired a meeting late in inadequate terms,31
NA,May where a number of problems in relation to mention of the three,31
NA,this industry were discussed. Significantly there is the notice of the House,31
NA,a letter that was sent to the Minister,31
NA,and Immigration on 26 July. As a result of that this kind. They did not do so.the,31
NA,"letter there was no evidence of any kind of action the matter with the ACTU inquiry, tried",31
NA,or activity by the Minister for Transport or by the would seem to have been broken. Itbut,31
NA,Minister for Labor and Immigration until the also that the sUence of the Ministerswould,31
NA,matter inadvertently appeared in the Press in what,31
NA,Melbourne about six or seven weeks later. The,31
NA,letter clearly drew attention to the fact that,31
NA,April this year the unions led by Mr ElUott,31
NA,made attempts to disrupt arrangements agreed,31
NA,between the Minister for Transport and the,31
NA,executive of the AustraUan CouncU of Trade,31
NA,Unions. The letter then describes the activities,31
NA,"the Seamen's Umon, which have been widely re-",31
NA,"ported, and the demands of the Seamen's Union.",31
NA,I would Uke to quote 2 paragraphs. Thefirstis:,31
NA,has now made a new demand that the difference in,31
NA,money amount between ITF rates and AustraUan rates be,31
NA,4,31
NA,proportionately into the funds of the seafarers union,31
NA,not to the ship's crew. He also stated that the money will,31
NA,"not be returned to the ship's crew, but retained by the unions",31
NA,'so as not to undermine the national economy'.,31
NA,ought to be The letter also states:,31
NA,have informed Mr Ray Taylor of the Federal Transport,31
NA,Mr John Limbrick of the Department of,31
NA,the matter. They cannot see any practical,31
NA,with relation to the present incident . . .,31
NA,That refers to making indemnity payments to,31
NA,the ships to sail. This letter is signed by Mr,31
NA,Henry and addressed to the Minister for Labor,31
NA,on 26 July. It directly impUcates the Depart-,31
NA,ments of both Ministers. Officers of the Depart-,31
NA,ments of both Ministers had said that there is no,31
NA,That means that officers of the,31
NA,"in Departments, against whose integrity I would",31
NA,"not put a slur for one moment, knew that both",31
NA,their Ministers would do nothing about this par-,31
NA,ticular matter. Those officers knew that the Min-,31
NA,ister for Labor and the Minister for Transport,31
NA,would not be prepared to act under the law as,31
NA,"struck. they ought to act, and they therefore had to say",31
NA,that there was nothing that could be done except,31
NA,to pay the extortion. This is part of the price of,31
NA,the cover up ofthe two Ministers and part of the,31
NA,himself price of sUence of the 2 Ministers.,31
NA,No doubt they hoped that they might be able,31
NA,to get over this particular matter by the state-,31
NA,"for ment of having an ACTU inquiry, but that was",31
NA,not to be enough. The matter was running too,31
NA,that. To prevent the inquiry running,31
NA,they then sought to have a restricted royal,31
NA,with restricted terms of reference,31
NA,certainly and positively would direct mat-,31
NA,case,31
NA,away from the activities-inactivit y in the,31
NA,of the Minister for Labor-o f the Minister,31
NA,"Therefore we had an inquiry, with",31
NA,"of reference, which makes no",31
NA,points which are brought to,31
NA,on this occasion. Both,31
NA,for Labor Ministers ought to act under,31
NA,law in matters of,31
NA,They to hide,31
NA,the law,31
NA,seem,31
NA,condoned,31
NA,in fact had occurred.,31
NA,since In a statement that the Minister for Labor did,31
NA,had make about this matter he condemned the action,31
NA,"because of the direction of the funds, because",31
NA,they were going to a special fund. He did not,31
NA,condemn the extortion or the indemnity pay-,31
NA,of ments. He only condemned the direction of the,31
NA,money. I do not suppose he condemned that part,32
NA,"of the direction of the money which put $5,000",32
NA,into the election campaign funds of the Aus-,32
NA,tralian Labor Party. Let us look at the charge,32
NA,that the Ministers did not take appropriate action,32
NA,under the law and that this is a matter which,32
NA,ought to have been examined. Three laws are in-,32
NA,volved in this particular matter. The first is the,32
NA,Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Under section,32
NA,152 of that Act unions are required each year to,32
NA,make an accurate statement of all receipts and,32
NA,expenditure and put in that statement to the,32
NA,Industrial Registrar. It is quite clear that that,32
NA,not been done and that action ought to be taken,32
NA,"under the Act, under the hand of the Mimster for",32
NA,Labor and under the hand of the Industrial,32
NA,Registrar.,32
NA,"Secondly we have the Crimes Act which, one",32
NA,"would think, prima facie has been breached. Sec-",32
NA,tion 30K of the Crimes Act is designed to protect,32
NA,interstate trade and make it possible to lay,32
NA,charges against the persons or organisations that,32
NA,obstruct or hinder the transport of goods or the,32
NA,conveyance of passengers in trade or commerce,32
NA,with other countries or among the States. Again,32
NA,there are words in that Act which would seem to,32
NA,imply that the activities of the Seamens Union,32
NA,have been quite unlawful. Thirdly we have the,32
NA,Navigation Act which requires that seamen in-,32
NA,volved in the coastal trade be paid proper rates,32
NA,and not rates less than those normally paid to,32
NA,Australians operating in Australian ships. Sec-,32
NA,tions 288 and 289 of the Navigation Act spell out,32
NA,very clearly that every seaman employed on a,32
NA,ship engaged in any part of the coasting trade,32
NA,"shall, subject to any lawful deductions, be en-",32
NA,titled to and shall be paid for the period during,32
NA,"which the ship is so engaged, wages at the cur-",32
NA,rent rates ruling in Australia for seamen,32
NA,employed in that part of the coasting trade.,32
NA,"Quite plainly, on the evidence that has been",32
NA,"made available to the Ministers, the Seamens",32
NA,Union has said to the companies concerned that,32
NA,the money is going to come to it. The money is,32
NA,not going to go to the seamen concerned. The,32
NA,unions and Mr Elliott have exhibited utter,32
NA,callousness in relation to people on low rates of,32
NA,pay and they have conspired and extorted to,32
NA,make sure that those parts ofthe Navigation Act,32
NA,are in fact broken and not held. Therefore there,32
NA,were three possible courses of action that the,32
NA,Ministers jointly could have taken. They could,32
NA,have launched normal police action because of a,32
NA,violation of laws. Much of what the Minister for,32
NA,Labor has done has sought to put above the law,32
NA,"certain militant unions-no t all, but certain ones",32
NA,which are most concerned to use their strength,32
NA,mercilessly against their own members and the,32
NA,people of Australia. By their failure to act in,32
NA,"these particular instances, by their failure to up-",32
NA,"hold the law as it stands, by their attempts to",32
NA,cover this matter with an inadequate inquiry-,32
NA,not inadequate because of the Commissioner but,32
NA,inadequate because of the terms of reference and,32
NA,because of the attitude of the Ministers and of,32
NA,this Government-th e two Ministers have done,32
NA,great harm to propriety in government. They,32
NA,"have destroyed their own reputations, particu-",32
NA,"larly the Minister for Transport who clearly, on",32
NA,has the evidence available has been involved in these,32
NA,matters in one form or another for significantly,32
NA,more than 12 months.,32
NA,On this basis one would have hoped that the,32
NA,Prime Minister might examine the evidence and,32
NA,take the course which I suggested at the outset.,32
NA,There is no other way in which the Prime Minis-,32
NA,ter can preserve integrity for his Government.,32
NA,This matter runs through and into the Depart-,32
NA,ments. It involves the two Ministers. They were,32
NA,given evidence. Laws are available. They have,32
NA,ignored the law. They have brought the law into,32
NA,disrepute allowing unions to operate outside the,32
NA,law. If that is to happen and it is to increase con-,32
NA,trol of this government by people like Mr Elliott,32
NA,industrial anarchy will become rampant,32
NA,throughout the Australian community.,32

Mr CHARLES JONES,I thank honourable,33
NA,members. We have listened to a lot of garbage,33
NA,this morning from the honourable member for,33
NA,Wannon ( Mr Malcolm Fraser). I wish to draw,33
NA,attention to the report from the Select Com-,33
NA,mittee Appointed To Inquire Into And Report,33
NA,Upon Payments To Maritime Unions dated Sep-,33
NA,tember 1958. This Committee was appointed by,33
NA,the Liberal-Country Party Government. I f,33
NA,honourable members wish the conclusions and,33
NA,recommendations of the Committee to be incor-,33
NA,porated in Hansard I shall be quite happy to do,33
NA,so. I wish to draw attention to paragraph 66,33
NA,which states:,33
NA,The Committee's general conclusions are that the evi-,33
NA,dence discloses acts of a highly improper character in the,33
NA,"nature of conspiracy, extortion and intimidation.",33
NA,The Liberal-Country Party-th e then govern-,33
NA,ment-ha d a majority on that Committee. What,33
NA,did it do about that report? The answer is a very,33
NA,"simple one. It did nothing, notwithstanding the",33
NA,Committee's general conclusion that the evi-,33
NA,dence disclosed acts of a highly improper,33
NA,"character in the nature of conspiracy, extortion",33
NA,and intimidation. The Liberal-Country Party,33
NA,Government did nothing about it. Liberal-Coun-,33
NA,try Party members should not come in here with,33
NA,all this pious humbug about what the Minister,33
NA,for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde,33
NA,Cameron) and myself have allegedly done. I,33
NA,deny most emphatically that I have been in-,33
NA,volved in anything improper. I have not been in-,33
NA,"volved in anytliing like, for example, Jetair. The",33
NA,honourable member for Wannon was a Minister,33
NA,"ofthe Cabinet that was involved in that stinking,",33
NA,rotten episode called Jetair. He was a Minister of,33
NA,the Government which-,33
NA,Mr MCLeay-Yo u are a disgrace as a Minis-,33
NA,ter.,33
Mr CHARLES JONES,I know members of,33
NA,the Opposition do not like it. It hurts them.,33
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I ask the Minister to,33
NA,keep within the terms of the motion before the,33
NA,Chair. The honourable member for Wannon was,33
NA,received in complete silence; I ask that the Minis-,33
NA,ter for Transport be afforded the same courtesy.,33
Mr CHARLES JONES," Mr Speaker, I will",33
NA,endeavour to keep to the points to which you,33
NA,"have referred. But, you know, Alexander Barton,",33
NA,"Jetair, Billy MCMahon-an d all that crowd who",33
NA,are going to speak on this-th e honourable,33
NA,member for Wannon and the honourable,33
NA,member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon)-don' t talk,33
NA,of such about anything that is putrid and rotten; you still,33
NA,stink from the smell of Jetair.,33
NA,changes are necess-,33
Mr MALCOLM FRASER , I rise on a point of,33
NA,order. The remarks of the Minister for Transport,33
NA,are quite offensive. I ask that they be withdrawn.,33
NA,The charges that I made were precise and based,33
NA,on evidence and on the Minister's own words. He,33
NA,cannot hide behind a stream of abuse.,33
Mr SPEAKER,I ask the Minister to keep to,33
NA,the point before the Chair. If my memory serves,33
NA,"me correctly, the honourable member for",33
NA,"Wannon also used the words 'it smells', which I",33
NA,do not think are quite parhamentary either.,33
Mr STALEY ,'It stinks'.,33
Mr SPEAKER,Order.' I ask the Minister to,33
NA,moderate his language in regard to these matters,33
NA,and to use parUamentary phrases.,33
Mr CHARLES JONES, Mr EUiott has made,33
NA,a statement-th e honourable member for,33
NA,Wannon repeated it-whic h is not true. It is per-,33
NA,fectly true that I did meet a delegation of sea-,33
NA,men's representatives including the State sec-,33
NA,"retary for New South Wales, Mr Benson, in my",33
NA,"office some time last year, perhaps August or",33
NA,September of last year. I saw him there. I met,33
NA,that delegation about 10 months ago. It is per-,33
NA,fectly true that I said that I was contemplating,33
NA,"imposing the condition, as the Navigation A c t -",33
NA,seeing that the honourable member for Wannon,33
NA,"has mentioned it-permit s me so to do, under",33
NA,which a single voyage permit can be issued. I in-,33
NA,dicated to that delegation that I contemplated,33
NA,doing this. Honourable members opposite say,33
NA,that they want to see facts. I am not afraid of the,33
NA,facts. I was pleased for one simple reason that,33
NA,this discussion did not come on yesterday. That,33
NA,reason was that my file was in the hands of the,33
NA,Royal Commission in Sydney. All of this infor-,33
NA,mation that I now show to honourable members,33
NA,is in the hands of the Royal Commission. I am,33
NA,"quite happy with the inquiry, however it goes.",33
NA,But the time avaUable to me today is very lim-,33
NA,"ited, so I had better get stuck into what I have to",33
NA,say.,33
NA,The facts are that on 30 July 1973 I approved,33
NA,the issue of a single voyage permit for the car-,33
NA,riage of detergent alkali by the 'AUied Trader'.,33
NA,One of the conditions of that approval was 'ap-,33
NA,proved subject to AustraUan rates'. Do honour-,33
NA,able members want to have a look at that docu-,33
NA,ment? There is a photocopy of the original which,33
NA,I show to honourable members opposite. I am,33
NA,quite proud of the fact that I imposed this con-,34
NA,dition that Austrahan rates of pay were to be,34
NA,paid. Not only did I impose that condition on,34
NA,that approval but also I did the same thing with,34
NA,respect to another ship a httle later. The carriage,34
NA,of a cargo of pyrites from South Australia to the,34
NA,"north-west shelf was involved. Unforiunately,",34
NA,this permit was not taken up. It was issued to the,34
NA,'Lady Vivian'. That was a condition on which,34
NA,approval was granted. I required that Austrahan,34
NA,rates should be paid and Austrahan conditions,34
NA,apply with respect to that approval. Those,34
NA,dents occurred prior to the September meeting.,34
NA,Because I was not satisfied that these moneys,34
NA,would be paid to the crews and that they could,34
NA,"retain these sums, I discontinued that practice of",34
NA,imposing the condition that Austrahan rates of,34
NA,pay had to be paid to the crews of the ships to,34
NA,which permits for single voyages were issued. I,34
NA,tell honourable members opposite today that i f l,34
NA,could be certain that the crews being paid that,34
NA,"money could retain it, every single voyage permit",34
NA,that I issue would be subject to that condition.,34
NA,Do not let us have any qualms about that. I em-,34
NA,phasise the point that the money would be paid,34
NA,to the crew and not go into any funds. My,34
NA,"colleague, the Minister for Labor and Immigra-",34
NA,tion ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has made a similar,34
NA,statement. I f you fellows opposite beheve in,34
NA,"cheap labour conditions, I hope the honourable",34
NA,member for Gippsland will come out and sub-,34
NA,stantiate that view.,34
NA,There is nothing illegal in what I have done.,34
NA,The Navigation Act provides that I can impose,34
NA,"conditions, and I do impose them. I repeat:",34
NA,When I am certain that the money,34
NA,"retained by the crew, permits will be issued with",34
NA,that proviso. Do not let us have any illusions,34
NA,about where I stand in respect of issuing such,34
NA,permits. I do not beheve that this money should,34
NA,be paid into any secret fund to be administered,34
NA,by individuals. All of the money that I am talking,34
NA,about would be paid to the crew. Either that,34
NA,would be done or the Government would impose,34
NA,a levy which would be subject to pubhc audit.,34
NA,"there is anything wrong with that proposal,",34
NA,"up and say so, and just say what-",34
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,Thi s is what happened.,34
Mr CHARLES JONES,I am not concerned overseas,34
NA,with what has happened.,34
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,Tha t is just it; we are.,34
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I repeat that the The,34
NA,honourable member for Wannon was heard in pay,34
NA,complete silence. I am gojng to ensure that,34
NA,Minister for Transport is'treated with the,34
NA,courtesy.,34
Mr CHARLES JONES,Thank you. I do not,34
NA,mind them mterjecting.,34
Mr SPEAKER,I do.,34
Mr CHARLES JONES,You might do. The,34
NA,"facts are that, when I say that I am not concerned",34
NA,"with what has happened, I am saying that I am",34
NA,concerned about matters with respect to which I,34
NA,give approval. I do not approve of all that has,34
NA,happened in the course of recent events. I did not,34
NA,approve of that and I took the appropriate action,34
NA,2 inci- as I will show honourable members in my,34
NA,remarks in the next couple of minutes.,34
NA,An incident was brought to my attention on,34
NA,approximately 12 November last year. I was,34
NA,"asked to issue a single voyage permit for a ship,",34
NA,the 'Manchester Viga' which was loading con-,34
NA,tainers ex Discovery Bay at Fremantle for Mel-,34
NA,bourne. I was asked to issue a single voyage per-,34
NA,mit for this ship on the advice of my Department,34
NA,that it was an onward movement where cargo,34
NA,"had been taken off some ship, dumped, and then",34
NA,was to be picked up later on and carried on. I was,34
NA,advised- I have the full advice here-tha t a,34
NA,"single voyage permit was not necessary, and I",34
NA,did not issue one. Let me explain how events,34
NA,turned out later after my involvement in the,34
NA,whole situation ceased. I received verbal advice,34
NA,which I beheve was of a confidential nature from,34
NA,the ship owners to the effect that they had paid,34
NA,"money to the Seamen's Union, which was then",34
NA,to be paid into the 'Noonga' fund. I had nothing,34
NA,whatever to do with that. It was not my responsi-,34
NA,bility. It was a matter between the ship owners,34
NA,and the unions. I repeat that it was nothing to do,34
NA,with me; the issue of a single voyage permit by,34
NA,will be me was not involved.,34
NA,I know and honourable members opposite,34
NA,know that for years shipping companies and the,34
NA,unions have been making all sorts of deals. I,34
NA,know from my own experience that members of,34
NA,my own union have been given extra time in,34
NA,"order to get ships out of the road, and to com-",34
NA,plete work on them and to get repairs done.,34
NA,"If Those are matters, as far as I am concerned, be-",34
NA,get tween the ship owner and the unions.,34
NA,The next incident which came to my attention,34
NA,occurred immediately I returned from my visit,34
NA,in July. This matter involved the issue of,34
NA,a single voyage permit for the carriage of oil. As,34
NA,"far as the permit being issued was concerned, it",34
NA,was recommended to me that I issue a permit.,34
NA,union had insisted on full Austrahan rates of,34
NA,being paid to the crew of this particular ship.,34
NA,the We were led to beheve that by arrangement be-,34
NA,same tween the union and the Ampol Company that,34
NA,company had agreed to pay the union one per,34
NA,cent which would go into union funds. That mat-,35
NA,ter had nothing whatsoever to do with me. It was,35
NA,a matter between the union and the company.,35
NA,The company was making no complaint whatso-,35
NA,ever about the matter to me.,35
NA,The first matter which was brought to my,35
NA,attention in this respect was the case of the,35
NA,'Sloman Alstertor'. I received a telex in my office,35
NA,at Newcastle from the agents for that ship. They,35
NA,sent me the telex which I now hold in my hand. I,35
NA,will give the House the details ofit. If honourable,35
NA,members wish I will incorporate it in Hansard as,35
NA,I have not time to read it. I ask for leave to do so.,35
Mr SPEAKER,Order! Is leave granted?,35
NA,"There being no objection, leave is granted.",35
NA,(The document read as follows)-,35

NA,the vessel will not be permitted to sail with her cargo for the,35

NA,"This telex, from a Mr Oent, asked me a series",35
NA,"questions. Among the questions, were these:",35
NA,(a) Can you give us any guidance in this matter from the,35
NA,Government point of view?,35
NA,(b) Should we pay this money and if so to whom?,35
NA,(c) Does a legal basis exist for such a claim by the Sea-,35

NA,gave:,35

Mr CHARLES JONES,I thank honourable,36
NA,members. Might I say also that within a few days,36
NA,"of sending Mr Dent this telex I met him, in com-",36
NA,pany with the honourable member for Par-,36
NA,ramatta ( Mr Ruddock). I was looking at ferries,36
NA,in Sydney Harbour and during the inspection,36
NA,and a tour up the Parramatta River-,36

Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,Doe s the Minister want,36
NA,an extension?,36
NA,Mr Charles Jones- I would accept an exten-,36
NA,sion of time.,36
Mr SPEAKER,Order! If a proposition is put,36
NA,to me for an extension of time I must put it and,36
NA,the House will decide.,36
Mr NIXON ,Gippsland) (11.44)-I move:,36
NA,That the time of die Minister for Transport be extended.,36
NA,The Minister for Services and Property ( Mr,36
NA,Daly) is shaking his head. He does not agree,36
NA,with the extension of time for the Minister.,36
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,36
Mr SPEAKER,I would remind the House,36
NA,that this is grievance day and there are 4,36
NA,speakers waiting to go on to grievances.,36
NA,Mr Nixon- I am sure that every member on,36
NA,this side of the House is prepared to give the,36
NA,Minister the opportunity to explain his position.,36
NA,It is a very serious charge and his own Minister,36
NA,will not even assist him.,36
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Minister will con-,36
NA,tain himself. The motion has been carried.,36
NA,"Mr Daly- A point of order, Mr Speaker. An",36
NA,allegation has been made that I will not assist the,36
NA,Minister for Transport. The situation is that this,36
NA,is grievance day. The Opposition has brought in,36
NA,a resolution taking away all the rights of private,36
NA,in relauon to unlicensed ships,36
NA,members this morning. There is a general ar-,36
NA,rangement for me to protect therightsof private,36
NA,members and I do not see why extensions should,36
NA,be granted to either side in that case.,36
NA,Mr Nixon- Iriseon a point of order.,36
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The motion has been,36
NA,carried and the Minister's time has been,36
NA,dispute arising the normal arextended.,36
Mr WENTWORTH ," I rise on a point of order, Mr",36
NA,tribunal either State or Common-,36
NA,Speaker. The Leader of the House is perfectly,36
NA,capable of extending grievance day. We heard a,36
NA,prime bit of hypocrisy from him a moment ago.,36
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I call the Minister for,36
NA,Transport.,36
Mr CHARLES JONES,I regret very much,36
NA,having taken Vh minutes of the time of back,36
NA,bench members for grievance day but it is I who,36
NA,"is under challenge. As far as I am concerned, if",36
NA,anybody challenges my honesty I must answer,36
NA,"the challenge. On 12 August I met Mr Dent, who",36
NA,had sent me the telex on 9 August. During that,36
NA,meeting and the inspection of the ferries he,36
NA,expressed to me his appreciation for the prompt-,36
NA,ness of my reply and the attitude which I had,36
NA,adopted. That is an indication of the attitude of,36
NA,people who are involved in these matters. On 15,36
NA,August I also forwarded to Mr Souter all the,36
NA,"information which I have just tabled, namely,",36
NA,the telex from Mr Dent dated 9 August and my,36
NA,reply dated 9 August.,36
NA,On 19 August Refrigerated Express Lines,36
NA,advised me that the 'Sloman Alstertor' was sub-,36
NA,ject to industrial dispute prior to sailing and that,36
NA,"only after the line had paid afigureof $ 1,074.92",36
NA,by cheque to the Seamen's Umon had it been al-,37
NA,lowed to sail. On 20 August I authorised the,37
NA,"sending of a telex to the Prime Minister, the",37
NA,Attorney-General and the Minister for Labor,37
NA,"and Immigration, enclosing a copy of the telex",37
NA,from the line. Unfortunately that was not,37
NA,despatched by my Department until the next,37
NA,day. On 21 August I went to the Prime Minister,37
NA,in the middle of the Budget discussions-,37
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ," A point of order, Mr",37
NA,Speaker. I ask that the Minister also have these,37

Mr CHARLES JONES,I thank honourable,38
NA,members. On 21 August I was concerned that,38
NA,there had been no action. I want honourable ment,38
NA,members to understand the state of the poUtical between,38
NA,scene at that stage. The Government was in the the,38
NA,middle of the Cabinet discussions on the Budget,38
NA,and honourable members on the other side made to,38
NA,should know what is involved in the weeks leadvessels,38
NA,"ing up to the Budget and in particular that week,",38
NA,"when we sat for 6 days, including a special sitting",38
NA,of ParUament. On 21 August I saw the Prime my own,38
NA,Minister and told him that there was an imporon,38
NA,tant matter with which I was concerned. I asked pose,38
NA,him had he seen the letters and he admitted to matter.,38
NA,me that at that point he had not seen them. The,38
NA,moment I outlined the issue and the facts to him urgently,38
NA,in relation to the way I saw them and what was vent,38
NA,happening he said: 'We are not going to tolerate feel,38
NA,this. Give me a letter to our coUeagues the Attorof,38

Mr SPEAKER,I s leave granted? There,38

NA,made by the Seamen's Union of Australia in respect,38
NA,German registered vessel 'Sloman Alstertor'.,38
NA,Mr Dent first brought this matter to my attention,38
NA,August. On 19 August he indicated to me that the vessel,38
NA,delayed by industrial action at Fremantle. Only after,38
NA,ment of $1074.92 had been made to a bank account,38
NA,nated by the Seamen's Union was the vessel permitted,38
NA,"sail. For your convenience,",38
NA,attached.,38
NA,"On 23 August, I received a message from Mr A. C. Rose,",38
NA,Director of P and O Ausu-alia Ltd that the vessel,38
NA,Reefer' was being delayed at Sydney in similar,38
NA,stances. A copy of this message is also attached.,38
NA,I might add that these are not isolated cases.,38
NA,Department have been advised verbally of other,38
NA,having been made by the Seamen's Union under the,38
NA,of industrial action. In recent weeks payments to,38
NA,men's Union have been made by Ampol Petroleum Ltd and,38
NA,Australian Newsprint Mills in respect of,38
NA,the 'Prima Maersk' and 'Thunderbird' respectively which,38
NA,had been issued with single voyage permits for the carriage,38
NA,of interstate coastal cargo.,38
NA,"In the case of'Thunderbird', the vessel is at present wait-",38
NA,Mining to berth at Melbourne to discharge newsprint from,38
NA,"Hobart but, according to the Shipper, the Seamen's Union",38
NA,has indicated that tug assistance will not be made available,38
NA,until further payment is made.,38
NA,In each ofthe cases which have come to my notice the pay-,38
NA,sought by the Union has been related to the difference,38
NA,the wage rates normally payable to the crew and,38
NA,rates which would apply if the crew were on Australian,38
NA,Articles. Although a receipt is held by Refrigerated Express,38
NA,Lines and Australian Newsprint Mills for the payments,38
NA,the Union there is no indication that the crews of the,38
NA,have received any additional remuneration during,38
NA,the period of employment on the Ausualian coast.,38
NA,"In relation to the attached representations from Mr Dent,",38
NA,view is that he should be guided by his legal advisers,38
NA,the course of action he should pursue in seeking to recover,38
NA,the payment made to the Seamen's Union. I would not pro-,38
NA,to offer any advice on how he should proceed on the,38
NA,I would propose therefore that we should examine,38
NA,the measures available to the Government to pre-,38

Mr CHARLES JONES,I thank honourable,38
NA,"24 August 1974 members. On Saturday, 24 August, after the",38
NA,Cabinet Budget discussions had concluded I sent,38
NA,the letter and recommendations to the Prime,38
NA,received Minister. He was then away for a week and I was,38
NA,(Ausaway for 4 days. When I returned to my office on,38
NA,"of the Monday, 2 September, at about 9 a.m. my",38
NA,colleague the Mimster for Labor and Immigra-,38
NA,on 9 tion ( Mr Clyde Cameron) rang me in Newcastle,38
NA,was in relation to this matter and put to me the prop-,38
NA,payosition that we should have a royal commission. I,38
NA,nomiimmediately agreed to this proposition and the,38
NA,to result is that today you have a royal commission.,38
NA,copies of the correspondence are,38
NA,"It is the wish of the Prime Minister, the Minister",38
NA,for Labor and Immigration and myself that this,38
NA,'Sevillan matter be fully investigated and exposed. Evi-,38
NA,"circumdence wUl be taken at the inquiry, unlike the",38
NA,inquiry set up by the Liberal-Country Party,38
NA,Officers of my Government in 1958 when people who tendered,38
NA,demands evidence were not subject to cross-examination,38
NA,threat by those affected by their evidence. The first,38
NA,the Seaparagraph in the recommendations of that com-,38
NA,coastal voyaging by mittee states that fact.,38
NA,"As far as I am concerned personally, I have",38
NA,never stopped moving on aU this information. As,38
NA,I receive the letters I refer them to people who,39
NA,are there to give the necessary legal advice on,39
NA,what can and should be done and what the,39
NA,recommendations are. I am not a lawyer and I,39
NA,cannot give you that legal advice. When these,39
NA,papers are produced for pubhc inspection and,39
NA,cross-examination at the royal commission it will,39
NA,be shown that at no time have the Department of,39
NA,Transport and its Minister accepted and,39
NA,tolerated payments of this type being made into,39
NA,"any fund. To the crews of the ships, yes. And I",39
NA,ask the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr,39
NA,Nixon) to say that he is opposed to the crews,39
NA,being paid this sort of money. I agree that Inter-,39
NA,national Transport Federation rates should be,39
NA,paid to all crews of international ships. It is part,39
NA,of the pohcy of the Labor Party and the trade,39
NA,union movement. It is true that I told Charlie,39
NA,"Fitzgibbons, who is a personal friend of mine,",39
NA,"both being Newcastle men, that there was no risk",39
NA,of any interference by me or any prosecution or,39
NA,action being taken against his union while it was,39
NA,insisting on the crews of foreign ships being paid,39
NA,ITF rates of pay. I challenge the Opposition to,39
NA,"dispute that, to say that I was wrong and that",39
NA,they should not get ITF rates of pay. That is the,39
NA,situation as far as I am concerned. I have no evi-,39
NA,"dence, no proof and no knowledge of any money",39
NA,"having been paid into secret funds-tha t is, as far",39
NA,as ITF rates of pay are concerned. I have been,39
NA,completely truthful and above board. Never for,39
NA,a moment have I tolerated a situation where,39
NA,money was obtained by means that could be,39
NA,referred to as blackmail or anything else.,39
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Minister's time is,39
NA,has expired.,39
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ," Mr Speaker, I rise on",39
NA,point of order. The Minister for Transport has,39
NA,said that the indemnity payments to the Watermember,39
NA,side Workers Federation will not attract,39
NA,"action so far as he is concerned. Sir, you ruled",39
NA,that the Waterside Workers Federation was the,39
NA,included in the terms of reference of the royal,39
NA,commission. Is it not necessary for the Minister,39
NA,clarify for the House whether the Waterside,39
NA,Workers Federation is included in the inquiry,39
NA,"especially as there is evidence, by Mr",39
NA,"Fitzgibbon's own words in some newspapers,",39
NA,"that $125,000 ofthe money coUected did not",39
NA,to ships'crews?,39
Mr SPEAKER,The Chair is unaware of what,39
NA,took place outside this House with respect,39
NA,payments.,39
NA,Mr Charles Jones- I am unaware of what,39
NA,Fitzgibbon has said to the Press.,39
Mr NIXON ,Gippsland) (11.51)-I wul go,39
NA,into the details ofthe last point in a moment but,39
NA,firsdy I shaU deal with something that the Leader,39
NA,of the House ( Mr Daly) said when we moved for,39
NA,the Minister for Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) to,39
NA,have an extension of ume in which to finish his,39
NA,remarks. The Leader of the House made the,39
NA,most miserable excuse possible for curtailing this,39
NA,debate by suggesting that we were cutting into,39
NA,private members' time on Grievance Day. The,39
NA,fact is that he would not enable a censure debate,39
NA,to be held on 23 August when we sought it nor,39
NA,would he bring it on on Tuesday. He permitted,39
NA,that debate yesterday which forced us to raise,39
NA,"this matter of public importance today, so cutting",39
NA,into private members' time. The fact that he is,39
NA,not prepared to support the Minister for,39
NA,Transport in answering the serious charge made,39
NA,against him is a disgrace.,39
NA,The Minister for Transport commenced his,39
NA,speech by referring to a 1958 report and making,39
NA,various allegations about what the Liberal and,39
NA,Country Parties may or not have done as a,39
NA,government. The honourable member for Wan-,39
NA,non ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) made specific aUe-,39
NA,gations. This case cannot rest on what the Minis-,39
NA,ter has put before the House today. The aUe-,39
NA,gations have not been answered in sufficient,39
NA,detaU. He has not explained the tardiness of his,39
NA,approach to the question or the tardiness of the,39
NA,Minister for Labor and Immigration ( Mr Clyde,39
NA,Cameron). Let me explain to the House what this,39
NA,matter is aU about. The facts are that extortion,39
NA,payments have been demanded and made. This,39
NA,clear from aU the evidence avaUable to us from,39
NA,newspapers over a period oftime.In fact I can,39
NA,"quote from the chief extortionist of all, ElUot V.",39
NA,"a ElUott, who said that they had demanded that",39
NA,the difference between the wages paid to each,39
NA,of the crew of the 'Thunderbird' and,39
NA,any the rate that would have been paid for Aus-,39
NA,"traUan crews, including leave entitlements for",39
NA,"period, be paid. The point is that Elliot V.",39
NA,Elliott did not demand that those payments go to,39
NA,to the crew. The Minister for Transport supports,39
NA,the idea that such payments should go to,39
NA,members of the crew. Elliot V. ElUott asked that,39
NA,these payments be paid into a certain bank,39
NA,account of the Seamen's Union. As the honour-,39
NA,"go able member for Wannon rightly pointed out, a",39
NA,letter from the Austrahan Newsprint MUls Lim-,39
NA,ited goes so far as to name the number of that,39
NA,Seamen's Union bank account. It is S090091.,39
NA,"to any The AustraUan Newsprint MUls paid $18,000",39
NA,into that account. There are allegations in sub-,39
NA,Mr sequent newspaper articles of amounts up to,39
NA,"$70,000 being paid.",39
NA,"Mr Charles Jones- I take a point of order, Mr",40
NA,Speaker. The honourable member is referring to,40
NA,Mr Henry's letter of 26 August.,40
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,"No , July.",40
NA,Mr Charles Jones-Th e letter the honourable,40
NA,member for Wannon mentioned was dated 26,40
NA,August and I received that on 29 August.,40
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,The letter I quoted was,40
NA,written on 26 July.,40
Mr NIXON,The letter to which I am refer-,40
NA,ring is dated 30 July and is entirely different. It is,40
NA,addressed to Mr H. Souter of the Austrahan,40
NA,Council of Trade Unions. I will have it incor-,40
NA,porated in Hansard if the Minister so desires.,40
NA,Mr Charles Jones-Al l right.,40
Mr NIXON,I t is included in Hansard.,40
Mr SPEAKER,The honourable member,40
NA,must have it incorporated in the correct manner.,40
NA,He must seek leave. I ask him not to forget the,40
NA,Chair.,40
Mr NIXON ,I seek leave to have that letter,40
NA,incorporated in Hansard.,40
Mr SPEAKER,Is leave granted? There being,40
NA,"no objection, leave is granted.",40
NA,(The document read as follows)-,40
NA,"Dear MrSoutar,",40
NA,Further to our conversation,40
NA,"sel 'Thunderbird', I enclose",40
NA,"Federal Minister, Mr Clyde Cameron, on 26 July and telex",40
NA,"sent to him on Monday, 29 July.",40
NA,explanatory.,40
NA,"Later on Monday, 29 July, Elliott advised Mr Deane of",40
NA,Hetherington-Kingsbury of a resolution by the Seafarers,40
NA,Unions that the difference in money amount between,40
NA,tralian rates and leave provisions and ITF rates,40
NA,visions applicable to crew members of the 'Thunderbird',40
NA,whilst engaged on the Australian coast be paid weekly,40
NA,account No. S090091 of the Seamens Union by bank cheque.,40
NA,In doing so Elliott rejected,40
NA,"any event, this should not apply for the seven days during",40
NA,which berthing of the vessel had been held up by Elliott's,40
NA,actions.,40
NA,"A payment of SI8,000 by means of a bank cheque",40
NA,made by Hetherington-Kingsbury to Elliott on July,40
NA,companied by a letter reading somewhat as follows:,40
NA,"Further to our conversation on Monday, 29 July",40
NA,enclose a bank cheque,40
NA,without prejudice and on the understanding that,40
NA,vessel 'Thunderbird' will be,40
NA,enable it to discharge newsprint.,40
NA,The cheque relates to portion of the difference in money,40
NA,amounts between AustraUan rates and leave provisions,40
NA,and ITF rates and provisions appUcable to crew,40
NA,members of the vessel 'Thunderbird' whilst engaged,40
NA,the carriage of newsprint between AustraUan ports.,40
NA,Your receipt is requested.,40
NA,We understand EUiott has now advised firemen,40
NA,deckhands that it is in order to benh the 'Thunderbird',40
NA,the vessel is expected to discharge newsprint in Sydney on 31,40
NA,July.,40
NA,Deane has been unable to obtain from Elliott any confir-,40
NA,mation of the reasons for his demand and he has in fact,40
NA,refused to do so. Whilst Hetherington-Kingsbury's letter,40
NA,"protects them to some extent, the action by EUiott is, in my",40
NA,"opinion, one of the most unsavoury I have yet encountered",40
NA,for the foUowing reasons:,40
NA,1. As arranged several years ago with the Waterside,40
NA,"Workers Federation, represenung the ITF, if a request",40
NA,is made to augment ITF rates to bring them up to Aus-,40
NA,"tralian rates, the amount has always been paid to the",40
NA,ship'screw.,40
NA,2. On this occasion the crew of the 'Thunderbird' could,40
NA,make such a request and this would lead to double,40
NA,payment by Hetherington-Kingsbury unless all sums,40
NA,paid to the AustraUan Seamen's Umon are recovered.,40
NA,3. In the absence of any written statement or acknowl-,40
NA,edgment by ElUott the payment to the Seamens Union,40
NA,"could be regarded as a bribe, a Christmas present, or",40
NA,whatever they Uke to caU it.,40
NA,"I have never heard of any simUar demand, but understand",40
NA,it is not unusual for the Seafarers Unions to be paid 'slush,40
NA,money' when overseas vessels are engaged in the carriage of,40
NA,AustraUan goods between Australian ports and amounting,40
NA,to 1 per cent of the freight rate.,40
NA,"Yours sincerely,",40
NA,R. W. Henry,40
NA,Managing Director,40
Mr NIXON ,"I thank the House. I might say,",40
NA,"Mr Speaker, that there is no way by which I",40
NA,could forget your presence. You remind me of,40
NA,your presence every time I make a speech in this,40
NA,on 30 July concerning the vesHouse.,40
NA,copy of a letter written to the,40
Mr SPEAKER,I tliink it is always needful,40
NA,"These, I think, are self that I do.",40
Mr NIXON," I do not wish to debate that, Sir.",40
NA,The fact is that there have been worse allegations,40
NA,Ausinvolving higher amounts. One such allegation,40
NA,and prowas made by Mr Fitzgibbon himself. It appeared,40
NA,in numerous newspapers throughout AustraUa,40
NA,into but I quote from the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of,40
NA,11 September wherein the following appears:,40
NA,"a suggestion by Deane that, in",40
NA,The Waterside Workers Federation has coUected at least,40
NA,"$370,000 from ship companies paying wages below inter-",40
NA,national rates.,40
NA,was From what Mr Fitzgibbon has said the money,40
NA,"30, acseems to have been spUt. Some of it went to the",40
NA,"crews-$125,00 0 is in doubt-bu t the remainder",40
NA,"1974, we is not explained. Where does that money go?",40
NA,"for $ 18,000. This amount is paid",40
NA,the That is the point the Minister for Transport has,40
NA,released immediately to not explained.,40
Mr HUNT ,Doe s it go to the Labor Party?,40
Mr SPEAKER,It is true that the Minister for,40
NA,in Transport made some passing references to some,40
NA,matters but I do not want the honourable,40
NA,member for Gippsland to debate them. As I,40
NA,"and ruled earher, reference to any matters covered by",40
NA,and the terms of reference of the royal commission is,40
NA,out of order. If the honourable member exam-,41
NA,ines the contents of this matter of pubhc impor-,41
NA,tance he will see that it does not include anything,41
NA,that touches on those terms of reference. I ask the,41
NA,honourable member for Gippsland not to refer,41
NA,to payments made to the Waterside Workers,41
NA,Federation because that matter is covered by,41
NA,paragraph (b) of part 1 ofthe terms of reference.,41
Mr NIXON, I accept your assurance that the,41
NA,Waterside Workers Federation is covered in the,41
NA,terms of reference. I am deUghted to hear it.,41
NA,"However, it runs contrary to what the Minister",41
NA,for Transport said. This is the point I am trying,41
NA,bring out. The Minister said that the Waterside,41
NA,Workers Federation has nothing to fear,41
NA,"him as Minister; in fact, he is setting out to",41
NA,tect it. I refer now to an article by James Ramsbring,41
NA,den which appeared in the 'Austrahan Financial,41
NA,Review' and which the Minister has not denied.,41
NA,The Minister has not denied the accuracy of that,41
NA,article in which it is claimed that the Minister,41
NA,said he would protect the Waterside Workers,41
NA,Federation. We need clearly to know that the,41
NA,"terms of reference are as you, Mr Speaker, have",41
NA,indicated.,41
NA,"Mr Charles Jones- Mr Speaker, I rise on a",41
NA,point of order. The honourable member for,41
NA,Gippsland is distorting what I said. What I said,41
NA,"to Mr Fitzgibbon, the Federal Secretary of the",41
NA,"Waterside Workers Federation, is that whenever",41
NA,his union takes action to insist on ships',41
NA,being paid ITF rates of pay he can expect,41
NA,attack from me.,41
Mr SPEAKER, I think every honourable,41
NA,member should read what appears on the blue,41
NA,program sheet. They would then be satisfied,41
NA,what the letter the honourable member for,41
NA,non submitted to me is all about. The subject,41
NA,matter of this matter of pubhc importance should,41
NA,be adhered to. I have explained why. The Australasia,41
NA,honourable member should not refer to anything,41
NA,that may prejudice the hearing of this matter,41
NA,fore the royal commission. After long consuldid,41
NA,tation with other people I have ruled that,41
NA,graph (b) of part 1 of the terms of reference,41
NA,covers the Waterside Workers Federation bethat,41
NA,cause it is a corporate body.,41
Mr NIXON,I do not want to intrude on the,41
NA,actions of the royal commission.,41
NA,ing to get is clarification from the Minister of,41
NA,various points. The Minister has not satisfied the,41
NA,Opposition as to his own actions or his tardiness.,41
NA,The Minister for Labor and Immigration apparside,41
NA,ently knew of this letter at the same time-th,41
NA,ter from the AustraUan Newsprint MUls-ye t,41
NA,did nothing about it. Perhaps we wUl hear from,41
NA,him what action he proposes to take. The Minis-,41
NA,ter for Transport has explained what he did on,41
NA,one or two ships. He lost interest in the levy after,41
NA,that point of time. The fact is that by losing,41
NA,interest in the levy which was to go to the crew he,41
NA,removed the one salutary thing that may have al-,41
NA,lowed the Seamen's Union to keep those con-,41
NA,"ditions operative, namely, that any levy raised",41
NA,would go to the crew. The Minister for Transport,41
NA,has said that on 2 ships he made sure that the,41
NA,money went to the crew. But then he seemed to,41
NA,lose interest. From that point of time the Minister,41
NA,has been tardy in his responsibUity. He has,41
NA,to explained his actions in relation to only 2 counts.,41
NA,He has a lot to account for. That is why we are,41
NA,from interested to know whether the terms of,41
NA,proreference of the Royal Commission wiU clearly,41
NA,out the whole of the facts relating to aU of,41
NA,the ships that have been involved in this issue of,41
NA,indemnity payments. It is a plain extortion,41
NA,racket. They are no more or less than bribes. This,41
NA,is one of the worst examples that we have heard,41
NA,of in AustraUan maritime history of such actions.,41
NA,This matter is under the direct responsibUity of,41
NA,"the Minister, but he has not been informative",41
NA,enough in telling us all the detaUs about it.,41
NA,The fact is that the Seamen's Union gave,41
NA,"$5,000 to the Labor Party's slush fund. We have",41
NA,seen a photograph of Senator Murphy collecting,41
NA,the cheque. But that is not the only point. The,41
NA,point is that 7 or 8 other unions are involved,41
NA,crews apart from the Seamen's Union. The other,41
NA,"no unions are the Marine Cooks, Bakers and",41
NA,"Butchers Association of Australasia, the",41
NA,Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's,41
NA,"Association of Australasia, the Federated Ship-",41
NA,wrights and Ship Constructors Association of,41
NA,"WanAustraUa, the Merchant Service GuUd of Aus-",41
NA,tralia-i t shocks me to see that union included-,41
NA,the Professional Radio Employees Institute of,41
NA,and the Australian Institute of Mar-,41
NA,ine and Power Engineers. How much money,41
NA,behave those unions been paid? How much money,41
NA,the Labor Party get out of them? We want to,41
NA,paraknow whether the terms of reference of the,41
NA,Royal Commission wUl bring to Ught the reason,41
NA,the Minister for Labor and Immigration has,41
NA,been so tardy in his action in handling this mat-,41
NA,ter. Is it because of the money paid to the Labor,41
NA,Party's slush fund that the Government has been,41
NA,What I am tryso tardy and loath to move?,41
NA,(Extension of time granted.),41
NA,One other point needs to be made. We on this,41
NA,of the House aUege that the terms of,41
NA,e letreference which have been drawn up for this,41
NA,he inquiry are too narrow. The Australian Council,41
NA,of Trade Unions wanted to hold its own inquiry,41
NA,into this matter. I am not at all convinced that,42
NA,Government did not elbow the ACTU to one,42
NA,side so that the Government would then control,42
NA,the inquiry. This is not a reflection on Mr Justice,42
NA,Sweeney. I have the greatest respect and regard,42
NA,for him. I am concerned about the limited terms,42
NA,of reference under which he is allowed to work.,42
NA,"Why the ACTU was elbowed to one side, the",42
NA,interplay of union rivalries and the dislike for the,42
NA,Minister for Labor and Immigration are all matbate.,42
NA,ters which could be brought to the fore and,42
NA,would be able to obtain a certain amount of,42
NA,information. But the narrow terms of reference,42
NA,of the Royal Commission may not allow that,42
NA,information to come out. For that,42
NA,not sure whether one of the reasons for elbowing,42
NA,the ACTU to one side was so that the Govern-,42
NA,ment itself could control the inquiry by limiting,42
NA,the terms of reference.,42
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,What additional terms,42
NA,of reference would you suggest?,42
Mr NIXON,I would like a term of reference,42
NA,that specifically goes into the reasons for the,42
NA,tardiness of the Minister for Labor and ImmirgaThe,42
NA,tion in handling this matter. Almost every,42
NA,newspaper in this country has printed a leading,42
NA,article to the preaching of the immoraUty of,42
NA,affair by the Minister for Labor and ImmigraMinister,42
NA,tion. Yet it took him 7 or 8 weeks to move on it.,42
NA,He did nothing. Yet his own Department was,42
NA,informed about it on 26 July by means of the,42
NA,ter by wbich the Department of Transport was,42
NA,also informed. I have grave suspicions about,42
NA,Umited terms of reference of the inquiry which,42
NA,will not give the Royal Commission the right,42
NA,look at the tardiness of the Minister for Labor,42
NA,and Immiigration in relation to this matter,42
NA,the performance of the Minister for Transport Tasmama.,42
NA,and the narrow actions that he took. I accept the,42
NA,explanation given by the Minister for Transport,42
NA,for what he has done. What I do not accept is,42
NA,what he has not done and what he has not that,42
NA,explained to this House. That,42
NA,reference ought to be drawn on a much broader,42
NA,and wider basis.,42
NA,What has happened to this slush,42
NA,that has gone to the Labor Party? We have,42
NA,only one pubhc example ofa fat cheque going,42
NA,the Labor Party? It is a serious aUegation that,42
NA,am making but the proof is there. The fact is that,42
NA,a photograph was taken of the representative,42
NA,the Seamen's Union handing a cheque to the Ermolenko?,42
NA,AustraUan Labor Party to be used for the last,42
NA,election campaign. How much more money,42
NA,to the Labor Party election campaign?,42
NA,much money did the other unions put in? How expired.,42
NA,the wide is this total extortion racket? There is no,42
NA,"way in the world that this Royal Commission,",42
NA,"with the terms of reference that it has, can get a",42
NA,picture of the total extortion rackets that are,42
NA,going on under this Government. For all the,42
NA,vague allegations that might have been made by,42
NA,the Minister for Transport about the activities of,42
NA,"the last Government, there is nothing to equal",42
NA,the specific charges that have been laid in this de-,42
NA,The Minister for Transport is as culpable as,42
NA,we the Minister for Labor and Immigration. When,42
NA,he repUes let us not have from the Mimster for,42
NA,Labor and Immigration one of those glib,42
NA,speeches in which he says nothing. We want ans-,42
NA,reason I am wers to the charges.,42
NA,If the Minister does not answer the charges he,42
NA,wUl be found guuty by the AustraUan people. I,42
NA,have no doubt that one of the grave reasons that,42
NA,the shipping compames did not complain was,42
NA,that the Minister for Transport shrugged his,42
NA,"shoulders and said: ""This was a deal between the",42
NA,ship owners and the unions and I have nothing to,42
NA,do with it.' He shrugged it from his shoulders.,42
NA,ship owners were unable to complain be-,42
NA,cause they knew darned weU that under this,42
NA,"Minister nothing would be done, that their ships",42
NA,this would be tied up at the wharves and that this,42
NA,would do nothing but protect the,42
NA,unions. The Minister has a great habit of protect-,42
NA,ing the unions. He is prepared to take on the,42
NA,letQantas hostesses and growl about their salary,42
NA,rises and make aU sorts of allegations about how,42
NA,the they got them. He is prepared to take on the,42
NA,Qantas pUots. He is prepared to support the use,42
NA,to of Royal AustraUan Air Force aircraft to take a,42
NA,Russian back to his commie friends. But he wUl,42
NA,and not use an RAAF aircraft to break a strike in,42
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I have allowed a Uttle,42
NA,latitude in making passing reference to matters,42
NA,have nothing at aU to do with the matter be-,42
NA,is why the terms of fore the Chair.,42
Mr NIXON,Th e Minister was prepared to,42
NA,indulge in strike breaking in relation to the,42
NA,Ermolenko affair but he would not help his starv-,42
NA,fund money ing Tasmanian friends.,42

NA,How Chair. The honourable member's time has,42
NA,"Mr Nixon- I rise on a point of order, Mr",43

Mr NIXON,Yes . The honourable member,43
NA,for Swan said that I referred to Mr Ermolenko as,43
NA,"a commie friend. I f l did, that was a mistake. The",43
NA,point I was making was that the Minister was,43
NA,prepared to see Mr Ermolenko carried back to,43
NA,his commie friends in an RAAF aircraft but he,43
NA,was not prepared to carry food to the starving,43
NA,Tasmanians in a time of strike.,43

NA,letter to you submitting for discussion this matter,44
NA,"of pubhc importance. It was not a criticism of me,",44
NA,Mr Speaker; I suggest it was a criticism of you,44
NA,because you clearly ruled that this matter was,44
NA,not subjudice.,44
Mr SPEAKER,There is no substance in the,44
NA,point of order. I ask honourable members,44
NA,keep raising points that are not points of order.,44
NA,Many honourable members are rising on the pre-,44

NA,I will not accept such an expression of opimon as,44
NA,a point of order. A point of order must,44

Mr CLYDE CAMERON, I want to say quite,44
NA,firmly now that i f l am interrupted any more by,44
NA,points of order or by interjections that Ifinduning,44
NA,"palatable, I shall at once resume my seat and the Australian",44
NA,pearls of wisdom that would otherwise have,44
NA,fallen from my hps will be lost for ever. I,44
NA,received the letter from Mr Henry in,44
NA,29 July. My secretary spoke with my central,44
NA,office in Melbourne the next day. On 31 July my appropriate,44
NA,secretary recorded a telephone advice,44
NA,copy of the letter received from Mr Henry was,44
NA,being sent by my secretary to my Department the fact,44
NA,requesting that the facts contained in Mr Henry's are,44
NA,letter be checked. A telex message was sent from,44
NA,my office with the text of the letter from Mr benefit,44
NA,"Henry dated 26 July, which included the text of",44
NA,the letter sent to the Austrahan Council of Trade,44
NA,"Unions by Mr Henry on 17 July-i t will be Mills,",44
NA,noticed that it was 9 days after Mr Henry wrote investigate,44
NA,to the ACTU that he decided to write to,44
NA,advice that he had contacted the Department of,44
NA,Transport about the matter. There was a telex union,44
NA,from the Department to my office,44
NA,outlining the Department's knowledge of events,44
NA,and comments on matters raised by Mr Henry in,44
NA,his letters to me. This telex also,44
NA,that the ship's agents had confirmed that,44
NA,had been cleared. On 12 August another telex,44
NA,was sent from my office setting out details of,44
NA,reply that I had received from,44
NA,Transport ( Mr Charles Jones) with whom I was,44
NA,in touch about the matter. On 21 August there,44
NA,was another telex from my office with a copy,44
NA,telex from the Minister for Transport outlining,44
NA,the text ofa telex which he had received concern-,44
NA,ing this matter. On 3 September I issued a Press,44
NA,release which I now ask leave to incorporate in,44
NA,Hansard.,44
Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,Leav e is granted if the,44

NA,62 Care of the Aged-Proposed Fuel and Energy,45
NA,52 Legislation in Western Australia,45
NA,- Question proposed:,45
NA,That grievances be noted.,45
Mr WILSON ,Sturt) (12.25)-There is an,45
NA,aged care crisis in the community. There is an,45
NA,urgent need for something to be done in the aged,45
NA,care area. Many of the people in the community,45
NA,who are operating organisations concerned with,45
NA,"care for the aged expected that in the Budget,",45
NA,"there would be some recogmtion of their needs,",45
NA,"Cameron, Donald",45
NA,"Connolly, D. M.",45
NA,but they were disappointed. It is true that the,45
NA,supplementary benefit in respect of nursing,45
NA,home care was increased on 1 August. But all,45
NA,"Edwards, H. R.",45
NA,"Erwin, G. D.",45
NA,that did was enable patients in nursing homes to,45
NA,afford the fees that then reflected the cost of,45
NA,operating those nursing homes. My concern,45
NA,today is for the patients. Those patients are going,45
NA,from onefinancialcrisis to another because of,45
NA,the Government's failure to recognise in the,45
NA,Budget the need to announce that nursing home,45
NA,benefits should be index related. A study of the,45
NA,Howard.J.W.,45
NA,"Hunt, R. J.D.",45
NA,figures on nursing home fees since 1 August indi-,45
NA,"cates quite clearly that, as a consequence of rising",45
NA,"costs, fees are getting beyond the level that a",45
NA,pensioner can afford to pay for proper nursing,45
NA,home care.,45
NA,Whenever one hears that nursing home fees,45
NA,have risen it is very easy to think that those who,45
NA,are operating the homes are putting up the fees,45
NA,in order to make a substantial profit. I draw the,45
NA,attention of the House to the fact that nursing,45
NA,home fees are controUed. Nursing homes can,45
NA,raise their fees only if the increase is approved by,45
NA,the Department of Social Security. That Depart-,45
NA,"Peacock, A. S.",45
NA,"Robinson, Eric",45
NA,ment has been examining many claims by nurs-,45
NA,ing home operators-som e private and some,45
NA,combined charity and benevolent organisations,45
NA,-t o justify increased fees and it has granted the,45
NA,increases because the fact is that over recent,45
NA,months the costs of operating nursing homes,45
NA,have escalated at a rate far in excess of the con-,45
NA,sumer price index and there are still further,45
NA,increases in the pipeline.,45
NA,Many of the nursing homes run by charities,45
NA,and benevolent organisations were nearly bank-,45
NA,"rupt in July. Because of their plight, the Govern-",45
NA,ment took temporary action. But aU it did was to,45
NA,release a tourniquet that had been tightening to,45
NA,strangulation point. The Government gave no,45
NA,indicauon of when nursing home fees would be,45
NA,again increased. Many nursing homes expected,45
NA,something to be done in the Budget. But if we,45
NA,look at the Budget we find that there is talk about,45
NA,deficit budgeting. If one studies the words and,45
NA,the papers attached to the Budget documents,46
NA,one will find that the Government expects to,46
NA,spend a mere $1.8m over and above thefigureit,46
NA,anticipated spending on 1 August when nursing,46
NA,home benefits were increased to bring them to a,46
NA,realistic level. It is quite clear that the Govern-,46
NA,ment does not intend to increase nursing home,46
NA,benefits between now and August of next year. I,46
NA,challenge the Minister for Social Security ( Mr,46
NA,Hayden) to deny that that is so. If he is able to,46
NA,"deny that it is so, why did he not include in the",46
NA,Estimates contained in the Budget a provision,46
NA,for greater funding of nursing homes? The pro-,46
NA,vision of a mere additional $1.8m in funds for,46
NA,nursing home care for the aged will go nowhere.,46
NA,The Minister has said that he wants to enable the,46
NA,charity and benevolent organisations which are,46
NA,operating nursing homes to provide greater,46
NA,facilities. It is not a question of their being able,46
NA,provide greater facihties; the crisis is that they,46
NA,will not be able to provide the facihties that they,46
NA,now offer to many thousands of needy people.,46
NA,He speaks about deficit budgeting as though the,46
NA,non-profit organisations are the only nursing,46
NA,homes that provide for pensioner patients. The,46
NA,facts is that 80 per cent of all patients in nursing,46
NA,homes are pensioners.,46
NA,The former Liberal-Country Party Govern-,46
NA,ment set in motion machinery that was designed,46
NA,to update nursing home benefits so that a patient,46
NA,with a pension income could not only afford,46
NA,reasonable accommodation but be left with,46
NA,some spending money equivalent to one-quarter,46
NA,of the standard rate pension plus supplementary,46
NA,assistance. What has this Government done? It,46
NA,has reduced the amount of spending money,46
NA,available to the pensioner from what it should be,46
NA,today-from $8.75 to $4. That $4 is now,46
NA,insufficient to cover the costs of the large number,46
NA,"of nursing homes that are forced, because of",46
NA,"wage claims, to charge fees in excess of what is",46
NA,commonly regarded as the standard fee- a fee,46
NA,calculated by adding the nursing home benefit,46
NA,and the proportion of pension income suppos-,46
NA,edly allocated to the cost of nursing home care.,46
NA,The figures show quite clearly that since 1,46
NA,August a large number of nursing homes have,46
NA,sought fee increases and have been granted,46
NA,them. To imagine that they are the only fee,46
NA,increases that will be granted between now and,46
NA,next August is to bury one's head in the sand. It is,46
NA,clear therefore that the Mimster is showing a lack,46
NA,of care for thefinancialwelibeing ofthe aged. I,46
NA,am constantly telephoned by people in great dis-,46
NA,tress. As a result of the fact that people cannot,46
NA,afford the cost of adequate care in nursing homes,46
NA,many are driven into unlicensed boarding houses,46
NA,where they pay their pensions for poor accom-,46
NA,"modation, inadequate food and inadequate",46
NA,medical care. In the meantime the nursing,46
NA,"homes, whether they be privately run or charity",46
NA,"run, are endeavouring to keep their heads above",46
NA,water financially. Many of these organisations,46
NA,which hope to expand the facihties that they can,46
NA,offer to the community and to offer accommo-,46
NA,dation and care to the people now in the second,46
NA,grade boarding houses are not willing to go,46
NA,ahead with their building programs. They are,46
NA,unwilling to take the financial gamble of being,46
NA,forced into a situation of near bankruptcy.,46
NA,Today many of these organisations are,46
NA,confronted with the knowledge that further wage,46
NA,"increases are in the pipeline. For example, in",46
NA,South Austraha under a recently negotiated,46
NA,to award for domestic staff the domestic staff are to,46
NA,be paid an additional $4.15. AppUcations for an,46
NA,additional week's leave for certain nursing staff,46
NA,are before the court. A new sister's award is to be,46
NA,handed down. Inflation in other cost areas is rap-,46
NA,idly forcing up prices. I urge the Minister in the,46
NA,interests of the patients and in the interests of hu-,46
NA,manity to announce that he wUl index relate the,46
NA,benefits so that they can be increased automati-,46
NA,cally as approval is given for fees to rise. If the,46
NA,fee rises are approved those fees are justified by,46
NA,the evidence and the Minister should be able to,46
NA,announce that additional benefits are avaUable,46
NA,to meet them.,46
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Martin)-,46
NA,Order! the honourable member's time has,46
NA,expired.,46
Mr BENNETT ,Swan) (12.35)- I rise to draw,46
NA,attention further to the tragic circumstances in,46
NA,Western AustraUa where legislation which has,46
NA,been sent from the Lower House to the Upper,46
NA,House proposes to take from Austrahan citizens,46
NA,their basic freedoms at law and to give to an elec-,46
NA,ted government powers which were not men-,46
NA,tioned during that government's election mani-,46
NA,festo. I refer to the Fuel and Power Resources,46
NA,Act Amendment BUl which was introduced by,46
NA,the Western AustraUan Liberal Government. It,46
NA,is alarming that there is no suggestion of a,46
NA,referendum to find out from the pubUc whether,46
NA,they accept the concept involved in the legis-,46
NA,"lation. The Law Society of Western AustraUa,",46
NA,"trade union leaders, State Opposition members",46
NA,and community leaders are expressing their ab-,46
NA,horrence of the proposals which take from citi-,46
NA,"zens the right to trial by jury, which gives the",46
NA,"Government the power of summary arrest, and",46
NA,which enable searches of homes without warrant,46
NA,to be carried out at a Minister's direction.,46
NA,I have said in this House in regard to similar,47
NA,legislation which was proposed here at one time,47
NA,"by the previous Government that, even if one",47
NA,were to accept the concept that the existing,47
NA,administration is soundly based-i n this case I do,47
NA,not think that the people who could propose such,47
NA,legislauon are soundly based-onc e these laws,47
NA,"are made they will be used in the future, perhaps",47
NA,by someone who is not of the same political be-,47
NA,"liefs, to suppress the public for other reasons",47
NA,"than industrial ones, that is, for purely poUtical",47
NA,ones. I have been dismayed to find that not one,47
NA,word of criticism has been uttered by the Federal,47
NA,Liberal Party representatives in this House to,47
NA,protect the freedom of their constituents- a free-,47
NA,dom which once lost perhaps will be impossible,47
NA,to regain without bloodshed.,47
NA,It is appalUng that there has been such neglect,47
NA,by those responsible for putting forward such,47
NA,treme legislation which could be ascribed only,47
NA,the worst types of government such as dictatorinclude,47
NA,ships or fascist administrations. These people,47
NA,should have been persuaded that the legislation,47
NA,should be withdrawn. It is a pity the Federal,47
NA,eral representatives have not approached their,47
NA,State counterparts to have the legislation,47
NA,"pletely redrafted, if not withdrawn. The legisspecially",47
NA,lation is sinister in its intent. It is not impossible,47
NA,to think of poUtical candidates at a forthcoming,47
NA,electionfindingthemselves in prison for activimoney,47
NA,ties or statements of support for workers' actions.,47
NA,Such things happen in countries not far from our,47
NA,shores.,47
NA,Even more restrictive amendments could be,47
NA,moved during an emergency session of Parsponsible,47
NA,Uament called during an emergency declared,47
NA,a Minister to give lumself wider powers. If the,47
NA,Press and other media were suppressed during,47
NA,such sittings of the Parhament no reports of,47
NA,proceedings would go forward to the pubUc.,47
NA,is possible within the terms of,47
NA,"aU the people, including those in the Law So-",47
NA,"ciety, who are protesting today were to protest",47
NA,during a declared emergency they would be,47
NA,ject to arrest and penalties. I would venture,47
NA,say that today's protest outside ParUament,47
NA,House in Western Australia would be impossible,47
NA,under the terms of the BiU which suspends our,47
NA,"proud West AustraUan heritage, our democratic",47
NA,constitution in that State.,47
NA,It is useless for a Minister or a member of,47
NA,Party to say that they would not use the power,47
NA,this way. Let us face it; politicians and poUtical,47
NA,parties come and go but the statutes they,47
NA,remain to be used by yet unknown people in the,47
NA,future. This is the tragedy of the situation.,47
NA,"Instead of examining aU the old, restrictive, un-",47
NA,necessary laws carried on from the unenlight-,47
NA,"ened EngUsh anti-working class laws, which still",47
NA,"apply unless repealed by a State, or requesting",47
NA,this national ParUament to examine and with-,47
NA,draw any anti-worker or anti-freedom laws insti-,47
NA,"tuted by previous national ParUaments, the",47
NA,Western AustraUan Liberal Party continues to,47
NA,support and perhaps even to suggest more,47
NA,repressive laws. The amazing situation is that,47
NA,there is no existing need for such legislation. The,47
NA,reason for the introduction of the legislation can,47
NA,be only political. The BUl has been brought for-,47
NA,ward perhaps to avoid future elections by sup-,47
NA,pression of poUtical Parties and their supporters.,47
NA,If that is not so these provisions should not be in,47
NA,the BUl.,47
NA,"As the legislation is retrospective in its nature,",47
NA,exwhat will happen in the future when it is,47
NA,to amended and when an emergency is declared to,47
NA,the current protestors as offenders?,47
NA,These State people are obviously power crazy.,47
NA,They are prepared to suppress all opposition at,47
NA,Liball costs. How wUl theyfinancetheir special,47
NA,poUce force appointed privately by the State,47
NA,comMimster? How wUl they finance the prisons,47
NA,established to hold the thousands of,47
NA,people who could be arrested on the accusation,47
NA,only of someone opposed to their beliefs? The,47
NA,"must come from somewhere, and perhaps",47
NA,this is where the answer Ues to the real reason for,47
NA,the legislation. It appears that this scheme is to,47
NA,be sponsored by some overseas force looking to,47
NA,control our fuel and energy resources. WUl this,47
NA,"force provide the finance needed, because no re-",47
NA,national government-eve n a Liberal,47
NA,"by one, I hope-woul d supply funds for a govern-",47
NA,ment to arrest people without charge or to hold,47
NA,them without trial. The AustraUan Constitution,47
NA,the would not aUow funds to be provided for such,47
NA,This repression. Suchfinancecould never come from,47
NA,"the BUl. In fact, if national funds.",47
NA,To whom is the Western AustraUan Liberal,47
NA,subGovernment actually beholden? This is some-,47
NA,to thing that everyone in Western Australia would,47
NA,like to know because no responsible freedom-,47
NA,loving Western AustraUan could dream up so,47
NA,much repression or in fact support it. Perhaps the,47
NA,legislation will be amended at thistimebut the,47
NA,fact wUl remain that the total repressions were,47
NA,initially introduced and withdrawn or amended,47
NA,any only as a result of public pressure. This pressure,47
NA,in could take place only before the BUl becomes,47
NA,law because when it is law no person wiU be able,47
NA,create to protest for fear of an emergency being,47
NA,declared. In fact many people who are about to,47
NA,demonstrate today outside the State Parliament,47
NA,House have asked me what protection they have,48
NA,from retaliation by State Liberals. All that I have,48
NA,been able to tell them is that if the present State,48
NA,Government fails to act in a reasonable manner,48
NA,and invokes penalties they will be in very real,48
NA,danger. So the fact that they are prepared to defy,48
NA,any dictatorship shows the depth of their revul-,48
NA,sion at the proposals and their fear for the future.,48
NA,I have never known such pubhc accord to such,48
NA,repression which most people describe as fas-,48
NA,cism. If this proposed law has done one thing it,48
NA,has united large sections of the commumty be-,48
NA,hind the State Labor Opposition in the need to,48
NA,root out this evil. People are demonstrating,48
NA,today and they will demonstrate in the future be-,48
NA,cause they beheve that this legislation will be,48
NA,"used, and used viciously. They are frightened,",48
NA,and rightly so. Today I asked the Minister for,48
NA,Manufacturing Industry ( Mr Enderby) who,48
NA,represents the Attorney-General (Senator,48
NA,"Murphy) in this chamber, what protection could",48
NA,be offered to Australian citizens who go to West-,48
NA,ern Austraha to act on national decisions? It is,48
NA,possible that during an emergency lasting some 6,48
NA,months they could be gaoled. It would appear,48
NA,that there is a possibility that no protection from,48
NA,a Minister's decision is available to them. It is,48
NA,frightening to think that people could in the nor-,48
NA,mal course of their employment travel interstate,48
NA,and lose the protection of the law normally,48
NA,afforded them in their own State which would,48
NA,allow them to appeal to the High Court of,48
NA,Austraha. This protection will be denied them.,48

NA,JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRICES,48
NA,Report,48
Mr HURFORD ,Adelaide)-On behalf of the,48
NA,Joint Committee on Prices I bring up the Com-,48
NA,mittee's report on prices of household soap and,48
NA,detergents together with the minutes of proceed-,48
NA,ings taken in connection with this inquiry. I ask,48
NA,for leave to make a short statement in connection,48
NA,with the report.,48
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Is leave granted?,48
NA,"There being no objection, leave is granted.",48
Mr HURFORD,This report on the prices of,48
NA,"household soaps and detergents, which has just",48
NA,"been tabled, is the first report of the Joint Com-",48
NA,mittee on Prices estabUshed in this Twenty-ninth,48
NA,ParUament. The report was tabled on 15 August,48
NA,in the Senate because this House was not sitting,48
NA,at that time and obviously it was necessary to,48
NA,"have the report tabled as soon as possible, par-",48
NA,ticularly as there had been a long delay caused,48
NA,by the double dissolution of the Twenty-eighth,48
NA,Parliament. After the report was tabled I issued a,48
NA,statement on the report. Rather than take up the,48
NA,"time of honourable members I shall, at the con-",48
NA,"clusion of these remarks, seek leave to have parts",48
NA,of that statement already given in the Senate,48
NA,incorporated in the Hansard of this House.,48
NA,I am dehghted to observe that the Govern-,48
NA,ment has taken quick action to implement some,48
NA,of the Committee's recommendations on this,48
NA,soaps and detergents report. The Prime Minister,48
NA,( Mr Whitlam) has referred the question of the,48
NA,level of protection to be afforded the household,48
NA,soaps and detergents industry in AustraUa to the,48
NA,Industries Assistance Commission. This is in,48
NA,direct response to the last recommendation ofthe,48
NA,Committee. The Minister for Science ( Mr Mor-,48
NA,"rison), in response to the third recommendation,",48
NA,has asked his Department to assist consumer or-,48
NA,ganisations to draw up questionnaires which,48
NA,would ask compames to substantiate the adver-,49
NA,tising claims they make.,49
NA,I am hopeful that the Government,49
NA,periodically will inform the Parhament of the,49
NA,action it has taken or proposes to take in respect,49
NA,of each of the recommendations made in the,49
NA,Prices Committee reports. There is such a,49
NA,follow-up in respect of the reports ofthe Parlia-,49
NA,ment's Public Accounts Committee.,49
NA,The Report has received wide coverage in the,49
NA,Press. Most of the pubhcity is complimentary,49
NA,and therefore pleasing to the Committee. There,49
NA,"was, however, one adverse comment with which",49
NA,"I want to take issue. Dr Donald Hendon, the",49
NA,head of the School of Marketing Services at the,49
NA,"New South Wales Institute of Technology, has",49
NA,described as 'demagoguery' the Committee's,49
NA,recommendation that the major manufacturers,49
NA,cut back on their advertising. This was reported,49
NA,in the 'Austrahan Financial Review' of 27,49
NA,August 1974. No reasons were pubhshed for,49
NA,such a view which is in complete contrast to the,49
NA,detailed reasoning by the Committee on all,49
NA,aspects of its conclusions and recommendations.,49
NA,In point of fact the suggestion of voluntary res-,49
NA,traint on advertising was something which the,49
NA,major manufacturers in the United Kingdom,49
NA,undertook of their own volition. Paragraph 106,49
NA,of the report refers to this. If Dr Hendon,49
NA,associates such a recommendation with,49
NA,"demagoguery-tha t is, unprincipled behaviour, if",49
NA,the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary is any,49
NA,help-hi s criticism must also apply to the United,49
NA,Kingdom industry. I am disappointed that a per-,49
NA,son in his position should make such an,49
NA,unquaUfied and baseless criticism without study-,49
NA,ing the facts more closely. If there is argument,49
NA,"against the reasoning in the Committee's report,",49
NA,let us hear it; but useful debate is not assisted by,49
NA,meaningless 'nonsense' which is of the same,49
NA,poor quahty as that which we see in some adver-,49
NA,tising slogans.,49
NA,"Furthermore, I am bound to point out that this",49
NA,recommendation for a voluntary cut-back on adtions,49
NA,"vertising is only a first step; if not implemented, companies",49
NA,the second recommendation that the Prices Jusdomination,49
NA,tification Tribunal examines the question of exwho,49
NA,cessive advertising becomes very pertinent. Since Interestingly,49
NA,"writing the above, I have seen a further article by as",49
NA,Dr Hendon in this week's 'Bulletin'. It is an have,49
NA,emotional effort spilling crocodile tears conincrease,49
NA,cerning how misunderstood is advertising. It market.,49
NA,does not in any way answer the detaUed reason-,49
NA,ing of the Committee's report. The Committee this,49
NA,has not attacked advertising per se. It has drawn petition.,49
NA,attention to the particular waste in the soaps and the,49
NA,detergents industry.,49
NA,The soaps and detergents report is virtually on,49
NA,the first reference chosen by the Prices Com-,49
NA,mittee since it was formed in the last ParUament.,49
NA,Most of the previous references have been given,49
NA,to us by the Parhament. This report underlines,49
NA,the usefulness of inquiries that study an industry,49
NA,and seek to assess the amount of useful com-,49
NA,petition in that industry. From such an investiga-,49
NA,"tion can come, among other things,",49
NA,recommendations which have as their main pur-,49
NA,pose the improvement of competition in that,49
NA,industry.,49
NA,"However, the Parliament should be informed",49
NA,that the Committee is severely restricted in the,49
NA,volume of work it can perform. A staff of eleven,49
NA,headed by a Class 10 Third Division officer can-,49
NA,not 'take on' the whole of the AustraUan econ-,49
NA,"omy. Furthermore, expertise in this difficult area",49
NA,of concern is not abundant and we have severe,49
NA,competition for that expertise from the Industries,49
NA,"Assistance Commission, the Prices Justification",49
NA,"Tribunal, Prices Branches in the Australian",49
NA,"Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, the",49
NA,Office of the Commissioner of Trade Practices,49
NA,"and so on. In just over one year of existence, the",49
NA,Committee has lost aU three of its Class 9 Third,49
NA,Division officers on promotion. I repeat-i n spite,49
NA,of commendable efforts by our secretariat there,49
NA,are severe limitations to the volume of work the,49
NA,Committee can perform in this important area of,49
NA,concern.,49
NA,I now seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the,49
NA,remaining parts of my statement on the report,49
NA,which has already been read in the Senate.,49
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Martin)-Is,49
NA,leave granted? There being no objection leave is,49
NA,granted.,49
NA,(The document read as follows)-,49
NA,The Inquiry on which this Report is based was conducted,49
NA,by the Committee established in the Twenty-eighth Parlia-,49
NA,"ment. The views, conclusions and recommendations, how-",49
NA,"ever, are those ofthe present Committee.",49
NA,"Briefly, the Report underlines the value of price investiga-",49
NA,that encompass an industry rather than the individual,49
NA,"that constitute that industry. Thus, the industry",49
NA,examination shows that the starting point for analysis is the,49
NA,of the market by the two major manufacturers,49
NA,between them control over 80 per cent of the market.,49
NA,"enough, where their market power is reduced,",49
NA,it is in the dishwashing/liquid detergent part of the mar-,49
NA,"ket (where they control less than 45 per cent), cost increases",49
NA,been absorbed with the result that the rate of price,49
NA,has been less frequent than in other sections of the,49
NA,"With the above exception, the Committee has found that",49
NA,industry exhibits an absence of real or effective com-,49
NA,"Incidentally, this conclusion is not very different to",49
NA,one arrived at by the United ICingdom Monopolies Com-,49
NA,mission that examined the household detergents industry in,49
NA,that country.,49
NA,The absence of real or effecuve competition has been,50
NA,reflected in-,50
NA,(i) the absence of price competition (with the,50
NA,of dishwashing detergents,50
NA,(ii) the unnecessary proliferation of brands;,50
NA,(iii) an excessive amount of advenising (which,50
NA,leads the consumer);,50
NA,(iv) unduly high pronts.,50
NA,It is against this background that the Committee,50
NA,its recommendations. The first two recommendations,50
NA,with reducing the level of advenising by the two major,50
NA,manufacturers. The Committee has asked the Attorneymembers,50
NA,General to inform the major manufacturers of,50
NA,mittee 's wish to see them enter into a voluntary agreement,50
NA,reduce the amount of advenising so that the consumer,50
NA,benefit from lower retail prices.,50
NA,that such an agreement would confer a specific and,50
NA,tial benefit to the public which would not be available,50
NA,out the agreement (see Section 90 (5) Trade Practices,50
NA,1974).,50
NA,The Committee also asks the Australian Government,50
NA,invite the Prices Justification Tribunal to examine,50
NA,tion of excessive advertising in this industry.,50
NA,particularly appropriate if the major manufacturers are,50
NA,reluctant to enter into a voluntary agreement.,50
NA,The other recommendations could be divided mainly into,50
NA,two sections. Thefirstdeals with the establishment,50
NA,dards and the testing of products against these standards.,50
NA,These recommendations are made to the Minister for,50
NA,ence who is responsible for the Interim Commission,50
NA,"sumer Standards, directly second set of recommendations",50
NA,rectly benefit the consumer. The Committee has rec-,50
NA,ommended that somefinancialassistance be given,50
NA,sumer organisations to assist them publicise the results,50
NA,tests. In another recommendation the Committee has,50
NA,the Minister for Science to assist consumers to,50
NA,tionnaires that would ask manufacturers and others to sub-,50
NA,stantiate the claims made in their advertising.,50
NA,These recommendations could,50
NA,make a more informed choice by reducing consumer,50
NA,exposure to meaningless messages such as,50
NA,white' and also by increasing consumer awareness of the,50
NA,quality of competing products. This in turn could lead to,50
NA,"greater purchases of good quality, lower priced products and",50
NA,thereby hopefully permit price competition,50
NA,petition based mostly on advertising and brands.,50
NA,"Finally, once again as a means of encouraging competition",50
NA,"in the domestic market, the Committee has recommended",50
NA,that the question of the level,50
NA,try be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission.,50
NA,"To sum up then, the view of the Committee is that the",50
NA,adoption of these various recommendations would,50
NA,"twofold impact. First, there would be a major reduction in",50
NA,retail prices if the level of advertising were,50
NA,would constitute visible benefits to the consumer.,50
NA,the other recommendations could increase the efficiency,50
NA,the industiy by stimulating a more meaningful type,50
NA,petition. This would result,50
NA,than they would otherwise be and would accrue to,50
NA,sumer in the longer term.,50

NA,pacity to do this is beyond question. The Govern-,52
NA,ment has also recognised that the provision of,52
NA,a new large amounts of bankfinanceto the Corpor-,52
NA,would have meant a substantial reduction,52
NA,in the amount of such finance avaUable to meet,52
NA,an other essenual needs in the rural and other,52
NA,the amount paysectors of the economy.,52
NA,These considerations led the Government to,52
NA,the view that the only really practicable way to,52
NA,to Tasprovide the Corporation with the finance,52
NA,required is by means of a special appropriation,52
NA,to the of funds by the Parliament. Honourable,52
NA,"members wiU be aware that, in addition to pur-",52
NA,"chases at prices equivalent to the floor price, the",52
NA,may attimesacquire wool at prices,52
NA,"above the floor price, under itsflexiblereserve",52
NA,"price scheme. Also, as indicated earlier, the Cor-",52
NA,operations in 1974-75 may entaU not,52
NA,only substantial purchases of wool but also ar-,52
NA,rangements for the withholding of wool from,52
NA,market at times when demand is weak. It will be,53
NA,"apparent to honourable members that, should",53
NA,the Corporation withhold wool from sale for a,53
NA,time pending an improvement in the market out-,53
NA,"look, some growers would be temporarily disad-",53
NA,"vantaged and, indeed, could be faced with con-",53
NA,"siderable financial difficulties, if the banking",53
NA,system and other traditional sources of finance,53
NA,for wool growers were unable or unwilling to,53
NA,carry growers for the additionaltimeinvolved.,53
NA,The Government has therefore decided to pro-,53
NA,vide the Corporation with sufficient funds to en-,53
NA,able it also to make advances of a proportion of,53
NA,the floor price to growers experiencing such,53
NA,difficulties. The total amount of funds likely to be,53
NA,required for the Corporation's purposes is,53
NA,"difficult to establish, depending as it does on the",53
NA,extent to which the trade supports the market It,53
NA,is considered that the amount available to the,53
NA,Corporation should be sufficiently large to cover,53
NA,its requirements for a reasonable period ahead.,53
NA,"Insofar as it is possible to predict at this stage, we",53
NA,judge that an amount of $ 150m should be fully,53
NA,"adequate for this purpose, and the Bill seeks an",53
NA,"appropriation of that amount. We shall, how-",53
NA,"ever, keep the position under close review.",53
NA,Having regard to the difficulty of forecasting,53
NA,with any precision either thetimingor amount of,53
NA,"the Corporation's requirements, the bill pro-",53
NA,poses that the Treasurer be empowered to make,53
NA,"advances up to the amount indicated, in such",53
NA,amounts and such terms and conditions as he ap-,53
NA,"proves. I shall, of course, exercise these powers in",53
NA,full consultation with the Minister for Agricul-,53
NA,ture. The Bill provides for the advances to the,53
NA,Corporation to be made either from the Con-,53
NA,"soUdated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund, and",53
NA,authorises me to borrow the moneys concerned if,53
NA,I consider that desirable. I am sure that honour-,53
NA,able members wUl appreciate the need for ex-,53
NA,"peditious action in this matter, to put the Wool",53
NA,Corporation in funds and demonstrate beyond,53
NA,aU possible doubt the Corporation's capacity to,53
NA,sustain its floor price operations. I commend the,53

NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,53
NA,The purpose of this BUl is to make a minor,53
NA,amendment to the States Grants (Beef Cattle,53
NA,Roads) Act 1968 in order to extend the period of,53
NA,appUcation of the Act to the State of Queensland,53
NA,from 1 July 1974 to 31 December 1974. Under,53
NA,"the terms of that Act, financial assistance in the",53
NA,form of grants totalling $39.5m was made avaU-,53
NA,able by the Australian Government to,53
NA,Queensland over the seven-year period from 1,53
NA,July 1967 to 30 June 1974 for the construction of,53
NA,an approved program of beef road works. The,53
NA,devastating floods in Queensland earher this,53
NA,year delayed progress on some of the works in,53
NA,the final year of the program with the result that,53
NA,by 30 June there was a relatively small shortfall,53
NA,in the expenditure under the approved program.,53
NA,The amendment of the Act is necessary in order,53
NA,to providefinanceto the State to the extent of the,53
NA,shortfall in the original program of approved,53
NA,"works. The amount involved is only $279,000",53
NA,and an appropriate provision has been made in,53
NA,the Budget. I would explain that the works in,53
NA,question have already been carried out. The Aus-,53
NA,traUan Government has pledged its assistance to,53
NA,Queensland in its flood restoration efforts and,53
NA,has consistently adopted a positive and construc-,53
NA,tive approach in this matter. This BUl is in keep-,53
NA,ing with that approach and I commend the Bill to,53

Mr BEAZLEY ,Fremantle-Minister for,53
NA,Education) (2.35)- I move:,53
NA,That the Bill be now read a second ume.,53
NA,The BUl has 2 main purposes. First it provides for,53
NA,an additional full time Deputy Chairman of the,53
NA,Universities Commission. This wUl bring the,53
NA,membership of the Commission to eleven. At,53
NA,the Commission has a full time Chair-,53
NA,"man, Professor Karmel, and Deputy Chairman,",53
NA,"Professor Bull, and 8 part-time members. There",53
NA,"are now 17 universities, and the WoUongong",53
NA,University College wUl achieve full university,53
NA,status in 1975. In addition the Government has,53
NA,approved in principle the establishment of new,53
NA,"universities at Albury/Wodonga, Campbelltown",53
NA,"and Geelong. Members wUl be aware, through",53
NA,"legislation which has been before this House,",53
NA,of the successive initiatives which the Govern-,53
NA,ment has taken in relation to universities-th e,53
NA,abolition of fees and the assumption of full finan-,54
NA,cial responsibihty by the Austrahan Govern-,54
NA,"ment, provision for needy students, new and",54
NA,"expanded medical schools, and support for new",54
NA,"programs in social work, special education and",54
NA,community practice. Altogether the workload on,54
NA,the Commission has increased markedly in re-,54
NA,"cent years and, given the major tasks of the",54
NA,"universities in teaching and research, will not",54
NA,diminish in the years to come.,54
NA,Professor Karmel himself has been heavily,54
NA,"engaged in a number of special inquiries, quite",54
NA,apart from his historic work with the Karmel,54
NA,"Committee on Schools, and is at present bringing",54
NA,to a conclusion the report on open tertiary edu-,54
NA,cation. The Government has therefore decided,54
NA,that an additional Deputy Chairman of the,54
NA,Commission should be appointed to assist with,54
NA,aspects of university programs which warrant,54
NA,special inquiry. He would have a particular re-,54
NA,sponsibihty for scientific developments and the,54
NA,"estabUshment of new universities, and would",54
NA,provide high level representation for the Com-,54
NA,mission on committees concerned with these,54
NA,matters. The appointment would be at the same,54
NA,terms and conditions as for the present Deputy,54
NA,Chairman.,54
NA,The second main purpose of the BUl is to,54
NA,amend the definition of'university',54
NA,pal Act to restrict the meaning of the word to,54
NA,institutions established by the AustraUan and,54
NA,"State ParUaments. Some self styled 'universities',",54
NA,which are in fact private coaching or teaching,54
NA,"ganisations, have been estabhshed from time",54
NA,"time, some of them with questionable edugroup",54
NA,cational standards and offering degrees and,54
NA,awards of doubtful content. The proposed,54
NA,amendment places no restriction on the activities,54
NA,of such organisations but makes it clear that the,54
NA,Commission will not make recommendations in,54
NA,respect of them; and this means they are not,54
NA,cepted as universities by the Government or the,54
NA,Commission. The BUl also includes 2 machinery,54
NA,measures. In accordance with the Government's,54
NA,"practice, the word 'AustraUan' wUl be deleted",54
NA,from the Commission's title and it wiU become,54
NA,the Universities Commission. Provision has also,54
NA,been made for the remuneration of members of,54
NA,the Commission to be determined by the,54
NA,Remuneration Tribunal. I commend the BUl to should,54

Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith-,54
NA,Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting,54
NA,the Prime Mimster in Matters Relating to the,54
NA,Public Service) (2.40)-I move:,54
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,54
NA,I present a BUl to be known as the Remuneration,54
NA,"Tribunals BUl 1974. This BUl, which wUl amend",54
NA,"the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, has 4",54
NA,"major purposes. First, the BUl expands the for-",54
NA,mal jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal,54
NA,"beyond the limits set in the present Act, to give",54
NA,full effect to the Government's pohcy that the,54
NA,Tribunal should fix the remuneration for all,54
NA,senior public offices in the Australian Govern-,54
NA,ment area. At present the Act provides for the,54
NA,Tribunal to determine the salaries of statutory,54
NA,office holders but does not give it power over,54
NA,many simUar positions which have in the past,54
NA,been dealt with by the same salary fixing pro-,54
NA,cedures as statutory office holders. Examples are,54
NA,the various offices which were included in the,54
NA,indicative determination which formed part of,54
NA,"the Tribunal's 1974 review. They included,",54
NA,"amongst others, the General Manager of Qantas,",54
NA,the Chiefs of Staff and the heads of several,54
NA,interim bodies for wbich statutory provision was,54
NA,in the princito be made.,54
NA,"Second, besides expanding the jurisdiction of",54
NA,the Tribunal the Bill lists several groups with,54
NA,orwhich the Tribunal is not intended to deal as,54
NA,to they do not form a part of the higher salaries,54
NA,and their remuneration has been fixed by,54
NA,"other procedures. These groups include, for",54
NA,"instance, the Trade Commissioner Service,",54
NA,which ought not to be in the Tribunal's jurisdic-,54
NA,"tion but which falls within it at present. Thirdly,",54
NA,the BUl clarifies a number of miscellaneous issues,54
NA,acwhich have so far arisen from the application of,54
NA,"the principal Act. Finally, the BUl inserts a new",54
NA,part in the principal Act providing for the estab-,54
NA,Ushment of an academic salaries tribunal along,54
NA,the Unes announced by the Government in April.,54
NA,The Tribunal wiU have the power to determine,54
NA,salaries for universities and colleges of advanced,54
NA,education estabUshed by law in the Territories,54
NA,and wUl recommend the rates of salaries which,54
NA,be used as a basis for grants to the States.,54
NA,I turn now to the detaU of the BUl. Clause 6,54
NA,amends section 3 of the principal Act to expand,54
NA,and clarify the jurisdiction of the Remuneration,54
NA,Tribunal along the Unes I have described. It lists,54
NA,the various categories of pubUc office with which,54
NA,"the Tribunal is to be required to deal, in addition",54
NA,to offices in the First Division of the Pubhc Ser-,55
NA,"vice, under section 7 (3) of the principal Act. Be-",55
NA,sides setting out these categories the Bill makes,55
NA,provision for additional offices or appointments,55
NA,to be prescribed by regulations. Clause 6 goes on,55
NA,to list offices for which the Tribunal wul not have,55
NA,power to determine remuneration. In general,55
NA,these are less senior appointments. There is also,55
NA,provision for prescription by regulation of any,55
NA,other offices which should be excluded from the,55
NA,Tribunal's jurisdiction.,55
NA,Clause 7 amends section 4 of the principal Act.,55
NA,It relaxes the very stringent conditions governing,55
NA,eligibility for membership of the Remuneration,55
NA,"Tribunal. As the Act stands at present, a person",55
NA,cannot be appointed to the Tribunal if he has at,55
NA,any time served in one of the offices within the,55
NA,Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Bill provides that a,55
NA,person should be disqualified for membership,55
NA,only if he has served in a relevant office within,55
NA,the previous 7 years. Clause 7 also provides that,55
NA,a member of the Tribunal shall not be appointed,55
NA,as Chairman if he has in the past 7 years been a,55
NA,member of the full time staff of a university or,55
NA,college of advanced education. This provision is,55
NA,included because the Chairman of the,55
NA,Remuneration Tribunal will be constituted as the,55
NA,Academic Salaries Tribunal.,55
NA,Clause 8 amends section 6 of the principal,55
NA,which deals with judges and Ministers of State.,55
NA,"Its purpose is to include with judges, persons",55
NA,who have the same status by virtue of an Act.,55
NA,This means that the Tribunal will report on the,55
NA,remuneration of such persons rather than deterfor,55
NA,mine it. This provision has been introduced to the,55
NA,cover the case of the President and Deputy Presireport,55
NA,dents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Comin,55
NA,mission. There is no constitutional obstacle,55
NA,Tribunal having power to determine,55
NA,these people but it is desirable for the sake of,55
NA,consistency that they should be considered by,55
NA,the Tribunal in conjunction with judges. Clause 8,55
NA,also revises the existing provision in section 6,55
NA,the principal Act dealing with matters 'sigsars,55
NA,nificantly related to remuneration'. It authorises,55
NA,"the Tribunal to inquire into matters which are,",55
NA,"which it considers to be, significantly related",55
NA,the remuneration of Ministers and judges either,55
NA,on its own initiative or at the request of the,55
NA,Minister.,55
NA,Clause 9 amends section 7 of the principal,55
NA,which gives the Tribunal power to determine,55
NA,"remuneration for parliamentarians, First Divitself",55
NA,ision officers and statutory office holders. It,55
NA,introduces a revised provision dealing with 'siging,55
NA,nificantly related' matters similar to that,55
NA,clause 8. It also provides that where,55
NA,funds available for the payment of remuneration,55
NA,they shall be used for this purpose. The principal,55
NA,Aa at present provides that remuneration in,55
NA,every case be paid from the Consolidated,55
NA,Revenue Fund and this is inconsistent with long,55
NA,standing arrangements for a number of com-,55
NA,pames and statutory corporations.,55
NA,Clause 9 also provides that members of Parha-,55
NA,ment or candidates for election will not be en-,55
NA,titled to any remuneration for holding a pubhc,55
NA,"office, that persons in the full-time service of",55
NA,Austraha will not receive payment for holding a,55
NA,"parttimeoffice except as prescribed, and that the",55
NA,holders of judicial offices in the States and other,55
NA,countries will not receive remuneration except as,55
NA,prescribed. Clause 10 amends section 8 of the,55
NA,principal Act to make an exception from the,55
NA,general rule that the Tribunal must deal at the,55
NA,one time with all the offices in its jurisdiction. It,55
NA,provides for the Tribunal to make individual,55
NA,determinations for new offices and offices whose,55
NA,functions have substantially changed since the,55
NA,Tribunal last reported.,55
NA,Clause 11 amends the principal Aa by the,55
NA,insertion of a new Part estabhshing the Aca-,55
NA,demic Salaries Tribunal. As I said earlier the,55
NA,Academic Salaries Tribunal will be constituted,55
NA,Act by the chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal.,55
NA,There is provision for appointment of assessors.,55
NA,The Tribunal will deal with academic staff in,55
NA,universities and colleges of advanced education.,55
NA,As I indicated earlier it will determine salaries,55
NA,academic staff in institutions established by,55
NA,laws of Austraha in the Territories. It will also,55
NA,on the rates of salaries for academic staff,55
NA,other institutions of tertiary education and,55
NA,to the recommend the rates to be used for making,55
NA,salaries for grants to the States.,55
NA,"Besides considering academic salaries, the Tri-",55
NA,bunal may report on the salaries of vice chancel-,55
NA,"lors, principals, other chief executive officers, and",55
NA,of other senior officers such as registrars and bur-,55
NA,in universities and colleges of advanced edu-,55
NA,cation. The procedures relating to the Tribunal's,55
NA,or determinations will be the same as for the,55
NA,to Remuneration Tribunal. The Minister will ar-,55
NA,range for a copy of each determination to be laid,55
NA,before each House within 15 sitting days of re-,55
NA,ceipt by him and either House will be able to dis-,55
NA,Act allow any determination within 15 sitting days,55
NA,after a copy has been laid before it. The Tribunal,55
NA,will have power to decide when to make,55
NA,reports and determinations. The provisions relat-,55
NA,to methods of inquiry by the Tribunal are the,55
NA,in same as for the Remuneration Tribunal. I com-,55

NA,"page 1437), on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen:",56
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,56
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith-,56
NA,Special Minister of State)-Ma y I have the indul-,56
NA,gence of the House to raise a point of procedure,56
NA,on this legislation? Before the debate on this Bill,56
NA,is resumed I would like to suggest that it may suit,56
NA,the convenience of the House to have a general,56
NA,debate covering this Bill and the Post and Tele-,56
NA,graph Bill 1974 (No. 2) as they are related,56
NA,"measures. Separate questions will, of course, be",56
NA,put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the,56
NA,"debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you",56
NA,permit the subject matter of both BiUs to be,56
NA,discussed in this debate.,56
Mr SPEAKER,I s it the wish of the House to,56
NA,"adopt this procedure? There being no objection,",56
NA,I will aUow that course to be followed.,56
Mr NIXON ,Gippsland) (2.48)-The first,56
NA,tiling I want to do is to lodge a protest on behalf,56
NA,of the Opposition that this very important Bud-,56
NA,get BUl should be introduced into the House for,56
NA,consideration in detaU by the Parhament before,56
NA,the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) has,56
NA,had a chance to present to the ParUament his,56
NA,analysis of the Budget as a whole. It is an,56
NA,improper practice. I am quite sure that we could,56
NA,"have facilitated the passage of this legislation,",56
NA,"both through this House and the Senate, had the",56
NA,Government been prepared to co-operate. The,56
NA,legislation could have been passed through the,56
NA,"House by the due date, 1 October. I understand",56
NA,that that is the point of time at which the,56
NA,Government wants to start collecting the exorbi-,56
NA,tant charges which are provided for under this,56
NA,legislation.,56
NA,The legislation is of major importance to the,56
NA,"AustraUan people. The Post Office, as an effec-",56
NA,"tive monopoly, provides services to the com-",56
NA,munity which affect the quality of Ufe of the Aus-,56
NA,trahan people. What that in turn means is that,56
NA,increases in the prices of these services wUl have,56
NA,a major impact on both the rate of inflation and,56
NA,the people's awareness of the rate of inflation.,56
NA,The proposed increases are very substantial.,56
NA,They include an increase of 43 per cent in the,56
NA,"basic postage rate, an increase of 33 per cent in",56
NA,the telephone service connection fee for new ap-,56
NA,"pUcants, a 30 per cent increase in the local tele-",56
NA,"phone caU fee, and an overall increase of 50 per",56
NA,cent in telegram charges. They are just a few,56
NA,(No.2) 1974 examples. These increases wUl have a direct,56
NA,"Second Reading inflationary impact and, as their justification is",56
NA,not required before the Prices Justification Tri-,56
NA,"bunal, it is the duty of this Parhament to",56
NA,scrutinise them carefully.,56
NA,A scrutiny of these charges must be looked at,56
NA,"in the hght of approved broad criteria, including",56
NA,economic circumstances. It is therefore quite,56
NA,reasonable that the Opposition should wish to,56
NA,wait for the presentation of the Budget before,56
NA,approving these proposals. I caU the attention of,56
NA,the House to the fact that on 23 July the Oppo-,56
NA,sition opposed simUar measures both in this,56
NA,House and in the Senate. They were not these,56
NA,"measures but lesser measures, I might say. We",56
NA,beUeved at that time that it was improper for the,56
NA,Government to introduce such measures prior to,56
NA,the introduction of its total Budget package. The,56
NA,postal services have run at a consistent loss since,56
NA,1964-65. This loss is estimated in the Budget,56
NA,papers to increase from $21m in 1972-73 to,56
NA,"$55m in both 1973-74 and 1974-75, even assum-",56
NA,ing that these increased charges will be put into,56
NA,effect. The Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop),56
NA,estimates that if these increased charges are not,56
NA,approved the postal service wUl incur a loss in,56
NA,this financial year of $ 100m. This is no less than,56
NA,five times the loss of only 2 years ago.,56
NA,Because the postal service is labour intensive it,56
NA,is vulnerable to wage increases. The telecom-,56
NA,"munications service, on the other hand, has a",56
NA,high capital content and is consistently and,56
NA,"increasingly profitable. Clearly, the overall prob-",56
NA,lem rests with the postal service. From a study of,56
NA,the accounts it is quite clear that a very alarming,56
NA,deterioration is occurring in the financial con-,56
NA,dition of the Post Office. The Vernon Com-,56
NA,mission in April estimated that postal service ex-,56
NA,penses in 1974-75 would rise by 10 per cent on,56
NA,"the 1973-74 level. Now, only 4 months later, we",56
NA,are told that the increase wUl not be 10 per cent,56
NA,"but a whacking 18 per cent, and this is in spite of",56
NA,severe restrictions on staff growth.,56
NA,This Parliament is clearly entitled to a detaUed,56
NA,explanation of this situation. I believe that the,56
NA,Postmaster-General has been derelict in his duty,56
NA,in that the second reading speech presented to,56
NA,this House by the Special Minister of State ( Mr,56
NA,"Lionel Bowen), who is at the table, says nothing",56
NA,on this point. In AprU the loss for postal services,56
NA,"during 1974-75 was estimated at $65m. Now,",56
NA,with an increase in tariffs of the order of 43 per,56
NA,"cent for basic postal charges, this loss of $65m is",56
NA,reduced by a mere SlOm. One does not have to,57
NA,be a mathematical genius to draw a pretty fright-,57
NA,ening conclusion about the sorts of charges that,57
NA,"would be necessary, in theory, on the basis of the",57
NA,Minister's assumption for that loss to be,57
NA,eliminated.,57
NA,Back in April the Vernon Commission thought,57
NA,that postal charges would need to increase at an,57
NA,average rate of 15 per cent. The Commission,57
NA,explained that this would mean that the cost of,57
NA,posting a letter would rise from 7c to 10c in less,57
NA,than 3 years. It has happened in less than 5,57
NA,months. The Parliament is entitled to an updated,57
NA,projection of postal charges in the light of the re-,57
NA,cent cost data. We are entided to a full expla-,57
NA,nation of the reasons for this deterioration.,57
NA,"Clearly wages are rising, but one would have",57
NA,thought that productivity was rising also. What,57
NA,the Minister has failed to say is the extent to,57
NA,<^..which industrial disputation may be contributing,57
NA,".., to the problem. It should be a cause of national",57
NA,concern that the Vernon Commission reported,57
NA,that in the 6 months to June 1973 there were no,57
NA,less than 28 black bans imposed in the Sydney,57
NA,"Mail Exchange; in other words, about one a",57
NA,week. Measured by articles handled per man,57
NA,"hour, productivity at the Sydney Mail Exchange",57
NA,fell by about 10 per cent absolutely between,57
NA,1964-65 and 1972-73. We are entitled to some,57
NA,explanation of what the Government intends to,57
NA,do about this. It is very simple to talk ofthe need,57
NA,to increase charges to meet expenses. It is even,57
NA,"more simple, and probably misleading, for the",57
NA,Budget documents on the Post Office to say:,57
NA,The record demand for,57
NA,cates that the present level of charges for that,57
NA,tively low.,57
NA,There is no evidence to support that bald,57
NA,"sertion. Indeed, there is no evidence to support",57
NA,the assertion of the Minister that these increased,57
NA,charges will yield the revenue,57
NA,Vernon Commission itself admitted that it would,57
NA,not be possible to calculate accurately the tariff,57
NA,"increases necessary to offset trading losses,",57
NA,changes in tariffs affect demand. The crunch-i,57
NA,"is a most important, indeed critical, crunch-i",57
NA,that we do not know and we are not told to what,57
NA,extent they affect demand. The Commission,57
NA,admitted that it was not able to work out,57
NA,elasticity of demand for postal services; yet,57
NA,are asked to approve increases of 40 per cent,57
NA,50 per cent without any estimate by the Minister,57
NA,of their impact on demand for postal services.,57
NA,Discussion over revenue and outlay really,57
NA,"the question. The central issue is the Governsays,",57
NA,ment's economic philosophy and its social,57
NA,guidelines for the postal services. The Minister,57
NA,asserts that they must pay their way. The prob-,57
NA,lem is that we are never really told clearly why.,57
NA,One explanation is contained in the second read-,57
NA,"ing speech, in which the Minister said:",57
NA,The Government is not prepared to allocate more from,57
NA,the Budget to the Post Office because this could only be at the,57
NA,"expense of our priority programs in the fields of education,",57
NA,welfare and health.,57
NA,Are we therefore to assume by this process of,57
NA,reasoning that it is more equitable in principle,57
NA,for low income earners to pay increases of 43 per,57
NA,cent in basic postage rates than it is for this pro-,57
NA,gram to be financed from the progressive tax-,57
NA,ation scale? The situation is even more puzzling,57
NA,when we are told by the Treasurer ( Mr Crean),57
NA,that the national broadcasting and television ser-,57
NA,vice is a service to the community as a whole and,57
NA,the Government believes that the cost of the ser-,57
NA,vice should therefore be met out of general tax-,57
NA,ation receipts rather than through a hcence fee.,57
NA,Why? It is because these flat charges bear more,57
NA,heavily on the less affluent. The Minister should,57
NA,tell us what is the distinction in principle between,57
NA,these charges and the other charges I have men-,57
NA,tioned.,57
NA,The political opportunism of the Government,57
NA,is plain for all to see when it adopts such a callous,57
NA,approach to financing public activities. I am not,57
NA,advocating that a rapidly deteriorating loss situ-,57
NA,ation should be permanently and totally met,57
NA,from public revenue. What I am saying is that we,57
NA,should expect some statement from the Minister,57
NA,as to the social role envisaged for the postal and,57
NA,telecommunications services. Contrary to what,57
NA,telephone services in 1973-74 indi-,57
NA,"the Minister said in his second reading speech,",57
NA,service is relathe Vernon Commission did not unilaterally,57
NA,choose a self-sufficiency role for these services. It,57
NA,said instead that it was reasonable to suggest that,57
NA,asif an uneconomic service is necessary for reasons,57
NA,of public policy the corporation providing the,57
NA,service should receive a subvention from the,57
NA,estimated. The Government.,57
NA,What I am saying then is that we do not really,57
NA,since know what the public policy of this Government,57
NA,t is. This is a matter of prime importance because,57
NA,s we are not considering a normal free market situ-,57
NA,"ation. On the contrary, we are considering a situ-",57
NA,ation where a publicly entrenched monopoly is,57
NA,the in the comfortable postion of imposing its own,57
NA,we charges. To explain that a little further-i t is able,57
NA,"to to charge the community for personnel, installa-",57
NA,tions and services which are selected not by the,57
NA,pubhc through competition but by bureaucratic,57
NA,begs decision. As the Veriion Commission rightly,57
NA,we should not be toorigorousin the light of,57
NA,those factors in applying normal commercial cri-,57
NA,teria. What we should be rigorous in doing is,57
NA,examining these increases in the light of our,58
NA,"present economic circumstances. For example, in",58
NA,"a total economic context, is it less inflationary to",58
NA,meet these losses for a hmited period from public,58
NA,revenue than to add them directly to the con-,58
NA,sumer price index?,58
NA,"The thrust of my approach, Mr Speaker, has",58
NA,been a call for greater information and greater,58
NA,clarity of pohcy. An example of this is the,58
NA,proposed increases in telecommunications,58
NA,charges. Telegram charges are to increase by,58
NA,"per cent in all cases, due to the",58
NA,incurred by this service. Yet it is by no means cer-,58
NA,tain that increases of 50 per cent are the answer,58
NA,"to this problem. The dechne in telegram usage is, inevitably",58
NA,"in fact, the principal reason for these increases .and. there",58
NA,due to the rapid growth in the use of telephone are,58
NA,and telex services. Telex charges themselves are would,58
NA,"to increase, but once again we are not told what sought",58
NA,the total effect on demand for telex as against rhetoric,58
NA,telegram services will be. We can only assume,58
NA,that the purpose is to make each individual com-,58
NA,ponent of the telecommunications sector selfWe,58
NA,supporting. Yet this pohcy of increasing the,58
NA,charges for unprofitable services ignores the,58
NA,overall profitability situation of telecommunithese,58
NA,"cauons, and the consequent fact is that if",58
NA,vices Usted need such large increases then there,58
NA,"must be other services which are highly profitaJuly,",58
NA,ble indeed. Are we to see the charges for those,58
NA,"services reduced? As it is, with these increased",58
NA,charges telecommunication charges wUl earn a,58
NA,"profit this year of $110m, although in relation to",58
NA,the assets this is less than 4 per cent. Yet once,58
NA,again we are told by the Mimster that the crisince,58
NA,terion is supposed to be a revenue sufficient,58
NA,"meet trading costs, depreciation and capital",58
NA,requirements. The criterion is not supposed to,58
NA,a return on assets. The Minister made a great,58
NA,play on words in his speech because the Oppowords,58
NA,sition refused to pass the increases proposed,58
NA,late July. We said then that the proposals,58
NA,inflationary and I quoted as support no less,58
NA,"source than the Treasurer himself, who took",58
NA,simUar stand in September 1971. Talking as,58
NA,"Shadow Treasurer about postal charge increases,",58
NA,he said:,58
NA,To us this seems to run contrary to what is described,58
NA,"overall strategy of the Budget, that is, the halting of",58
NA,Many of these charges can only aggravate i n f l a t,58
NA,increases charges the impact of which will be felt,58
NA,individuals whose purchasing power will be reduced,58
NA,they can increase their incomes,58
NA,takings which have the ability to pass on the increased,58
NA,"charges. To say the least, this Budget will accelerate",58
NA,tion.,58
NA,This is the Treasurer who the other night,58
NA,introduced a Budget foreshadowing mcreased,58
NA,business charges to an extent greater than was,58
NA,"thought possible. But he is still in good company,",58
NA,because he was supported in 1971 by the then,58
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, the present Prime",58
NA,"Minister ( Mr Whitlam) who, it wUl be recalled,",58
NA,during the last election campaign had this to say:,58
NA,' I am the only man in Austraha who can reduce,58
NA,inflation'. We have seen the greatest height in,58
NA,inflation since 18 May that has ever been known,58
NA,in the history of this country. Let me quote what,58
NA,the Prime Minister said when he was Leader of,58
NA,50 the Opposition. How the horse can change its,58
NA,substantial losses colour. He said:,58
NA,Postal and petrol increases in the current Budget wiil,58
NA,"produce an identical effect, as will payroll tax",58
NA,. There will be immediate rises in costs to all consumers,58
NA,will be an inevitable ftowthrough as these charges,58
NA,passed on later in the year. All these rises could and,58
NA,have been avoided by a government which genuinely,58
NA,to hold prices down. How can we take seriously the,58
NA,of Ministers on inflation when the Government,58
NA,makes so consistent and comprehensive a contribution to the,58
NA,rapidity with which living costs increase?,58
NA,are now Uving intimesof highest inflation,58
NA,which he and his Ministers have caused. How,58
NA,can this nation take seriously the statements that,58
NA,economic managers or mismanagers now,58
NA,the sermake? The course they have adopted is the,58
NA,course of which they were critical 3 years ago. In,58
NA,the mini-Budget was supposed to deal with,58
NA,inflation but it contained not one item that would,58
NA,help correct the course inflation was taking.,58
NA,"Indeed quite to the contrary, it was totaUy infla-",58
NA,"tionary in effect. That has been seen, of course, in",58
NA,the very way in which inflation has heightened,58
NA,then. In the last debate on postal charges on,58
NA,to 25 July I quoted from a number of industry,58
NA,sources that very clearly showed the inflationary,58
NA,be hike that would be created by increased post and,58
NA,telegraph charges at that time. I quoted the,58
NA,"of Mr F. J. Darhng, Executive Director of",58
NA,"in the Employers Federation of New South Wales,",58
NA,"were Mr K. D. WUUams, President of the AustraUan",58
NA,"a Chamber of Commerce, Mr C. F. SulUvan, the",58
NA,a Acting Director of the Victorian Chamber of,58
NA,"Manufactures, and Mr J. B. Griffin, ofthe RetaU",58
NA,Traders Association of New South Wales. Each,58
NA,of those individuals described the proposals of,58
NA,25 July of the Minister to increase postal charges,58
NA,"as the as being inflationary. The Minister, in justifica-",58
NA,"inflation. tion of his stand at the time, quoted during his",58
NA,i o n . .. It speech last Tuesday night from a couple of,58
NA,not only by newspaper articles which supported his stand.,58
NA,unless But he was very selective in his approach. I wish,58
NA,but also by business under-,58
NA,to quote from a newspaper which should be par-,58
NA,inflaticularly well-known to one honourable member,58
NA,"who is present in the House, that is, the 'Geelong",58
NA,"Advertiser' of Saturday, 27 July 1974.1 have not",58
NA,heard the honourable member to whom I am,58
NA,referring stand up in this House and proudly,59
NA,quote from the same leading article as the one,59
NA,from which I am about to quote. It reads:,59
NA,"The suggestion made by Mr Nixon (Country Party, Vic-",59
NA,toria) in the House of Representauves that the proposed,59
NA,increases in postal charges should be deferred until their,59
NA,effects on inflation could be determined is one of the few,59
NA,sane suggestions which has been made in Canberra with,59
NA,regard to the current economic crisis and the shock mini-,59
NA,"budget designed to deal with it. But of course, Mr Nixon's",59
NA,motion was defeated on Pany lines.,59
NA,The one thing of which the readers of the,59
NA,newspaper were not made aware was that the,59
NA,"honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes),",59
NA,who is a resident of the area in which the,59
NA,"newspaper is printed, voted against the proposal",59
NA,I put forward. The article continues:,59
NA,Pointing out that the new postal charges would impose a,59
NA,"burden of $ 140m on the public, Mr Nixon said: 'The ration-",59
NA,"ale for this, they claim, is the problem of inflation. I would be",59
NA,one of the last to deny that inflation in AustraUa is,59
NA,but the real concern is whether the proposals are antiinflaview.,59
NA,tionary or whether they are simply measures to raise,59
NA,for a bankrupt government.,59
NA,That is what I said. I was accurately reported. ism.,59
NA,That is slightly different from the selected pieces,59
NA,of newspaper material that the Mimster chose to,59
NA,use in his speech on Tuesday night.,59
NA,Mr Ian Robinson-Tha t was propaganda.,59
Mr NIXON,I t was propaganda. The article,59
NA,continues:,59
NA,"That, indeed, is the real concern. Announcing the",59
NA,"budget proposals last Tuesday, the Federal Treasurer,",59
NA,"Crean, said: ' I say, without exaggeration, that the",59
NA,economy now faces a highly dangerous situation. The,59
NA,community wUl have to suffer for a while to beat inflauon'.,59
NA,"Yet, the next day, his colleague, the Deputy Prime",59
NA,"ter, Dr Cairns, in a radio broadcast,",59
NA,"to see what could be anti-inflationary in the mini-budget,",59
NA,and he repeated that statement later in the House,59
NA,Representauves amid raucous laughter from the Opposiuon.,59
NA,The President of the Australian Council of Trade,59
NA,"Hawke, also expressed a pessimistic view with regard",59
NA,anti-inflationary prospects ofthe various proposals.,59
NA,That article was written at the time the Minister,59
NA,introduced the previous BiU. He is now sitting,59
NA,the table in charge of a BUl which compounds,59
NA,"the situation-indeed , which has increased the",59
NA,charge for postage stamps by lc more than the,59
NA,amount set on 23 July. So he is compounding the,59
NA,situation and making it even worse. The leading,59
NA,article to which I have referred and which I,59
NA,is an excellent one goes on to say:,59
NA,"Instead, numbers of country post offices have closed,",59
NA,"deliveries have been curtailed, telegraphic services",59
NA,been restricted and complaints of inexplicable,59
NA,effecting delivery of letters,59
NA,to the establishment of hundreds of private courier services.,59
NA,"This practice is illegal as, by law, the Post Oflice",59
NA,"opoly on mail delivery, but all it can do about the",59
NA,"parently, is to complain that it",59
NA,of postal business. This is entirely,59
NA,'customary' decline in service foUows the latest proposal to,59
NA,"increase postal charges, it will lose still more cream. Then,",59
NA,"presumably, it will become necessary to raise charges again;",59
NA,"and so, ad infinitum.",59
NA,What has happened only 8 weeks later? The,59
NA,Minister has proposed that the charges be,59
NA,increased again. The article continues:,59
NA,As the Government has declined to hold the inquiry re-,59
NA,"quested by Mr Nixon, it now rests with the Opposition",59
NA,strength in the Senate to make a move. If it would see its way,59
NA,"to rejecting the enabling legislation, as it has done in the case",59
NA,"of members' salary increases, it could be doing a service not",59
NA,"only to the economy of AustraUa, but to the Postmaster-",59
NA,General 's Depanment itself.,59
NA,That is an occasion on which the 'Geelong,59
NA,Advertiser' recognised the value of the action,59
NA,taken by the Senate.,59
NA,Mr Bourchier-I t must be a good newspaper.,59
Mr NIXON,I t is a good newspaper. It,59
NA,"serious, presents a sensible, sane and balanced point of",59
NA,It has quite clearly recognised the impor-,59
NA,"funds tance of the Senate, which the Government is",59
NA,setting out to destroy by its claims of obstruction-,59
NA,I have already said that the Minister's second,59
NA,reading speech is totaUy inadequate in its expla-,59
NA,nation of the financial expectations. For exam-,59
NA,"ple, the previous BUls were said to be BUls which",59
NA,would raise an extra $140m; yet in his second,59
NA,reading speech the Minister said that the loss of,59
NA,minifunds as a result of the Opposition's refusal to,59
NA,Mr pass the previous BUls would amount to $30m,59
NA,Ausualian over a period of 8 weeks. Surely that figure,59
NA,"whole should be only $22.3m, which is one-sixth of",59
NA,$140m. It is plain that by increasing postal,59
NA,"Minischarges from 7c to 10c, the local call fee from",59
NA,said it was very difficult,59
NA,"4.75c to 6c, the telephone connection fee from",59
NA,"of $60 to $80, business rentals from $30 to $85 and",59
NA,"household rentals to $65, the Government is",59
NA,"Unions, Mr intent on making a further profit out of the",59
NA,to the increased charges now being proposed. The sim-,59
NA,ple fact of the matter is that the Postmaster-,59
NA,General's Department has lost only 8 weeks,59
NA,at revenue as a result of the Opposition's actions,59
NA,and wUl gain an extra 44 weeks at least at the,59
NA,higher rates. There is no doubt that the Govern-,59
NA,ment is proposing to make a profit out of the,59
NA,delay. In July the Minister claimed that the pro-,59
NA,posals would have given a profit of $60m to the,59
NA,think Postmaster-General's Department. The loss in,59
NA,"the 8 weeks period, as I have said, was $22.3m.",59
NA,mail So a greater profit wUl accrue from the further,59
NA,have increases proposed. It is totally outrageous that,59
NA,delays in the Government should proceed to increase,59
NA,are legion. This situation has led,59
NA,profits further for this reason and it is both stupid,59
NA,has a monand irresponsible to assert that the higher,59
NA,"matter, apincreases now being proposed are a result ofthe",59
NA,is being robbed ofthe 'cream' delay.,59
NA,"its own fault, and if the",59
NA,In his second reading speech the Mmister,60
NA,"stated that he did not propose, indeed he found",60
NA,"inequitable, to require the residential telephone",60
NA,subscriber to pay more because of the delay.,60
NA,How he can state that there is less equity for,60
NA,telephone subscriber than a poor pensioner who,60
NA,has no telephone and who must use the mail and,60
NA,therefore who must pay the increased price of,60
NA,10c for postage stamps beats me. That assertion,60
NA,is as inequitable as it is not to charge for teledo,60
NA,vision and radio services but to charge more for,60
NA,the necessary services of the Post Office. The,60
NA,whole approach of the Government to this Bill,60
NA,shows once more its lack of credibUity in general,60
NA,financial management.,60
NA,I started out by saying that I am disappointed,60
NA,that the Government is forcing this BUl through,60
NA,this House today before the Leader of the,60
NA,sition has been given an opportunity to present,60
NA,the Parhament and the nation his attitude and,60
NA,approach to the whole of the Budget Papers. The,60
NA,Opposition is not opposing this BUl on this subscribers,60
NA,occasion. It has given the Government an opporand,60
NA,tunity to withdraw it. The Opposition has forced,60
NA,the Government to withdraw a sinular propadditional,60
NA,osition and to reconsider the position. The,60
NA,Government not only has not taken into account,60
NA,"the Opposition's suggestion, but also has been",60
NA,sUly enough and stupid enough,60
NA,charges further. I do not think the people of,60
NA,AustraUa wUl forget that.,60
Mr SCHOLES ,Corio) (3.13)-One of the,60
NA,things that was apparent from the speech by the,60
NA,honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon),60
NA,is the ease with which one can oppose while,60
NA,Opposition and how easy it is for politicians,60
NA,score poUtical points from any increased charges.,60
NA,It is obvious that aU poUticians do not hke to,60
NA,party to increased charges. I think it is also obvito,60
NA,ous that Oppositions always oppose aU forms,60
NA,increased charges and propose always additional,60
NA,forms of expenditure.,60
Mr GILES ,Bu t we are not opposing.,60
Mr SCHOLES,That may weU be so. The present,60
NA,fact ofthe matter is that the honourable,60
NA,"for Gippsland, on behalf of the Opposition, has",60
NA,made a very strong case against an increase in prevented,60
NA,"the charges. That is not a difficult case to make. Irevenues,",60
NA,acknowledge that it is not difficult to make such a the,60
NA,case. The Post Office is not the best example,60
NA,cost cutting enterprise and it is not the best,60
NA,le of an organisation in which cost,60
NA,e minimised. I think that the question which has,60
NA,been posed is whether the Government raises,60
NA,revenue to meet the increased costs of the Post,60
NA,"Office from those who use the services, as",60
NA,"been proposed by the Government, or from the",60
NA,it general taxpayer. It is a Uttle unfair to suggest,60
NA,that the major burden of these increases falls on,60
NA,"business, farmers and the like. The major cost",60
NA,a burden faUs on the private user. The private tele-,60
NA,phone user is not able to claim his telephone,60
NA,costs as a tax deduction. A private person posting,60
NA,letters is not able to recoup the cost ofhis stamps,60
NA,as a business expense; he pays the total amount. I,60
NA,not think anyone would seriously suggest that,60
NA,a differential rate of postage should be estab-,60
NA,"hshed, but it is proposed to acknowledge the situ-",60
NA,ation to a limited degree by proposing a lower,60
NA,rate of telephone rental for private users.,60
NA,Although I think it is true to say that the cost to,60
NA,the Post Office of providing telephone services at,60
NA,"most private residences, because of their low",60
NA,"Oppousage, would be much more expensive to the",60
NA,to community than would be the provision of busi-,60
NA,"ness telephones because of their higher usage,",60
NA,these proposals recognise the fact that private,60
NA,meet the total cost of their telephone,60
NA,postage commitments. Most private people,60
NA,have very few postage commitments. I think the,60
NA,postal charges for stamps is more ofa,60
NA,nuisance than a substantial cost against their,60
NA,incomes. Some people write a lot of letters but,60
NA,the great majority would make very little use of,60
NA,to increase the postage stamps.,60
NA,I was elected to this Parliament in 1967. The,60
NA,"'Geelong Advertiser', which was mentioned pre-",60
NA,"viously, is a fully owned subsidiary of the Mel-",60
NA,"bourne 'Herald', which is not noted for its sup-",60
NA,port of the present Government. I know that its,60
NA,in editor does not know the honourable member,60
NA,to for Gippsland personaUy but that paper mis-,60
NA,guidedly made certain statements about his san-,60
NA,be aity. I shall not repeat them because I do not Uke,60
NA,tell Ues in Parliament. The editor said that the,60
NA,of honourable member made a sane suggestion. I,60
NA,would suggest that the honourable member for,60
NA,Gippsland have a look at the remarks ofthe Mel-,60
NA,bourne 'Herald' and 'Sun' and the 'Geelong,60
NA,"Advertiser' when the then Opposition, the",60
NA,"Government, rejected postal charges in",60
NA,the Senate in 1967.1 think he wUlfindthat that,60
NA,member was said to be an irresponsible act wbich,60
NA,the Government from raising its,60
NA,even though these newspapers decried,60
NA,necessity to increase postal charges. I cannot,60
NA,ever remember an Opposition supporting,60
NA,"ofaincreases in charges, and I do not exclude sup-",60
NA,examporters of the present Government from that.,60
NA,increases can They are always opposed.,60
NA,the Early in his speech the honourable member,60
NA,for Gippsland made play of the problems of the,60
NA,"has Redfern MaU Exchange, which is most likely the",60
NA,greatest single problem the Post Office has. The,61
NA,Exchange was not established by the present,61
NA,Government and I do not think that it was estab-,61
NA,lished in the initial stages advisedly by the pre-,61
NA,"vious Government, even though its advisers may",61
NA,have recommended it. But I do not blame the,61
NA,then Government for establishing the present,61
NA,situation. It was faced with a problem which it,61
NA,sought to solve in a certain way. I think that in,61
NA,fairness to the people who work in the Redfern,61
NA,Mail Exchange I should say that the number of,61
NA,man days lost through strikes in that mail,61
NA,exchange is lower than the national average.,61
NA,Where inconveniences are involved the mag-,61
NA,nitude of every day lost is always potentially,61
NA,greater in terms of pubhcity value than where,61
NA,inconvenience is not involved. The fact of the,61
NA,matter is that there are fewer man days lost in,61
NA,that exchange than is the national average. One,61
NA,of the problems the Post Office faces is a problem,61
NA,"which the Post Office itself complains of, that is,",61
NA,that it has lost considerable areas of lucrative,61
NA,business to private enterprise. It lost it during the,61
NA,period of office of the former Government when,61
NA,"courier services, red telephones and other oper-",61
NA,ations were allowed to commence in areas which,61
NA,were obviously profitable to the Department and,61
NA,in which the Department had an exclusive right,61
NA,under the postal legislation. The philosophy of,61
NA,"socialising losses and capitalising profits, which",61
NA,has always been the philosophy of honourable,61
NA,"members opposite, worked in the Post Office as it",61
NA,has in the railways and every other form of,61
NA,industry. The Opposition has always sought to,61
NA,make those sections of commerce which cannot,61
NA,be effectively operated at a profit by private,61
NA,enterprise a responsibihty of the taxpayer even,61
NA,though the taxpayer in the main obtained less,61
NA,benefit than do private business operations. This,61
NA,is true of the Post Office. The general taxpayer,61
NA,without business interests obtains less benefit,61
NA,from the operations of the Post Office-eve n,61
NA,though he obtains considerable convenience-,61
NA,than does the business community. Yet the busi-,61
NA,"ness commumty, because it is able to have its",61
NA,"costs written off against taxation, pays less for",61
NA,convenience than does the general taxpayer.,61
NA,"No one likes increases in costs, but increases",61
NA,costs take place and they continue to take place.,61
NA,A letter cannot be sent on a courier service which,61
NA,is running in direct competition with the Post,61
NA,Office for the same cost this year as last year,61
NA,the year before. If honourable members opposite,61
NA,are suggesting that they enjoy some sort of purity,61
NA,"in relation to increasing charges, I remind them",61
NA,again that I was elected to this Parliament after,61
NA,"the then Opposition in the Senate, improperly",61
NA,my view- I say that quite advisedly-ha d,61
NA,"blocked increased postal charges, in May 1967,",61
NA,on exactly the same pretext as was used on this,61
NA,"occasion, that is, that they should be included as",61
NA,a general budgetary item. One of the first,61
NA,crises-i t was a period of crisis in the Labor Party,61
NA,at thattime-that confronted Caucus when I was,61
NA,first a member ofit was whether we would allow,61
NA,the postal charges to pass in the Budget session.,61
NA,The Democratic Labor Party had the balance of,61
NA,power in the Senate and it was prepared to take,61
NA,the popular stand. No honourable members op-,61
NA,posite who were then in government were stand-,61
NA,ing in this place saying that we should block the,61
NA,postal charges then. Of course they were not;,61
NA,they had the responsibility of government and of,61
NA,running things and they had to accept the un-,61
NA,"popular decision, just as we have to accept the",61
NA,unpopular decision now. That is what govern-,61
NA,ment is all about.,61
NA,Nr Nixon-Inflatio n was not the problem it is,61
NA,now. This is a quite different matter.,61
Mr SCHOLES,Inflation? What the honour-,61
NA,able member is saying is that if honourable,61
NA,members opposite increase charges costs are not,61
NA,increased but i f we increase charges costs are,61
NA,increased? That is just utter rubbish. The cost of,61
NA,general postage in my first 2 years in this Parlia-,61
NA,ment rose by 40 per cent. To suggest that that did,61
NA,not increase costs is ludicrous. To suggest that to,61
NA,increase postal charges in this way would add,61
NA,any more to costs than would the expansion of,61
NA,the Budget to provide this money out of general,61
NA,taxation revenue is ludicrous. It is money raised,61
NA,from the community whether it is raised in the,61
NA,form ofthe cost of postage stamps-tha t costs the,61
NA,average taxpayer less than it would if we put it,61
NA,on his taxation bill-o r is raised in the form of,61
NA,general taxation or deficit budgeting.,61
NA,"As I said before, in every area the present Op-",61
NA,position has continually practised the pohcy of,61
NA,putting loss situations on the taxpayer. Aus-,61
NA,trahan Country Party members will be well,61
NA,aware of the regular practice of using the rail-,61
NA,the ways for services where the freight rates are kept,61
NA,low because it is the only form of transport which,61
NA,can effectively transport the farmers' goods and,61
NA,in of using road transport for those areas of,61
NA,transport which would be lucrative to the railway,61
NA,systems. The result of this is that every railway,61
NA,system in Australia is in great debt. Many ser-,61
NA,or vices are being maintained only in order to pro-,61
NA,vide a service to communities which could not,61
NA,survive in a free enterprise system without that,61
NA,form of support. I do not object to that one bit,61
NA,because that is what it is all about. We live in a,61
NA,in society in which everyone does not hve at the,61
NA,point of sale of products and if we need to subsitries,62
NA,dise the carriage of some goods then we have,62
NA,do so.,62
NA,It is equally true to say that the cost of postal,62
NA,services varies throughout the community.,62
NA,should it cost 10c to carry a letter over the road?,62
NA,This is a ludicrous charge for the carriage of a letUkely,62
NA,ter over such a short distance. But it also will cost the Commonwealth,62
NA,10c to carry a letter from Melbourne to Darwin,62
NA,or from Melbourne to Perth. No one has efficiency.,62
NA,suggested that there should be a differential rate,62
NA,and I think it would be quite improper to,62
NA,introduce one. But if we were to carry out the Post,62
NA,type of pohcies that a free enterprise operation,62
NA,would undertake we would have differential doubt,62
NA,charges. I have said more than once that soever.,62
NA,people-an d poUticians especiaUy-d o not Uke,62
NA,increased charges. But I would suggest,62
NA,they do not Uke other people to seek to pretend,62
NA,that they would do anything different. WhUst,62
NA,may be true that honourable members opposite,62
NA,would change the rentals of telephones of counpostal,62
NA,try people to advantage certain people they,62
NA,would stUl have to raise the revenue one way,62
NA,another and someone would pay because there,62
NA,"not one cent- I repeat, not one cent-expende",62
NA,by this or any other government that someone,62
NA,the community does not pay and the only deof,62
NA,cision which is reaUy made is how much shall,62
NA,spent and who shaU pay the greatest amounts.,62
NA,We have a different plulosphy from that of the,62
NA,Opposition and that is why we sit on different,62
NA,sides of the chamber.,62
NA,It has been said that telephone services are,62
NA,being used to subsidise postal services. I take it,62
NA,that the Opposition uses this argument to justify,62
NA,an increase in the cost of postal services. If,62
NA,Opposition's arguments were accepted an legislation.,62
NA,increased rate of inflation would result from such,62
NA,increased charges. Apparently the Opposition,62
NA,beUeves that if postal charges were increased,62
NA,telephone services would then be reduced.,62
NA,"Rationalised further, the Opposition would then",62
NA,look at some of the services provided for public,62
NA,convenience by the Post Oifice which are Budget.,62
NA,uneconomical and it would then say that those,62
NA,services should be priced at a level which would,62
NA,make them completely uneconomic and as a,62
NA,result it would discontinue their operation. Some,62
NA,services have already reached this stage.,62
NA,Ueve that postal orders are hardly competitive,62
NA,with bank cheques. They are far too expensive,62
NA,and would seem to me to be an inefficient form,62
NA,transfer of money. This is especiaUy so where,62
NA,postal orders for some reason have to be posing,62
NA,reclaimed when uncoUected. One can cancel,62
NA,cheque and one's loss is almost nil. But,62
NA,"to recoup a postal order, especially one that",62
NA,to has been sent to another country-an d this has,62
NA,been the case for a long time-on e can wait up to,62
NA,six to eight months to get one's money back.,62
NA,There are plenty of instances of this happening.,62
NA,Why These are services which could be and most,62
NA,should be examined to see whether or not,62
NA,"they are worth continuing, and whether or not",62
NA,Bank could possibly carry,62
NA,out the service at a lower rate and with greater,62
NA,But whUst there is a need for these ser-,62
NA,"vices and whUe the services are being used, the",62
NA,Office must provide them. The Post Office,62
NA,also provides many agency services which have,62
NA,nothing to do with the Post Office and on which I,62
NA,that the Post Office makes any profit what-,62
NA,"also that Finally, the honourable member for",62
NA,Gippsland referred to a newspaper in my elector-,62
NA,it ate. He did not quote what was said by that,62
NA,newspaper when he was supporting increased,62
NA,charges in exactly the same circumstances,62
NA,as exist now. He quoted the situation at the time,62
NA,or which suited him. The opinions of honourable,62
NA,is members in this place on matters like this are,62
NA,d more related to which side of the Speaker's,62
NA,in Chair we sit than they are to the actual passage,62
NA,the legislation. But the Opposition is acting in,62
NA,be this matter in exactly the same way as the Oppo-,62
NA,sition ofthe day did in 1967. Having rejected the,62
NA,legislation in July the Opposition is now faciUtat-,62
NA,ing its passage with verbal opposition in Sep-,62
NA,tember.,62
NA,The argument was put forward that the,62
NA,Government should have waited until after the,62
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Snedden) had,62
NA,the made his Budget speech before introducing this,62
NA,Whilst this argument may be valid it,62
NA,is less valid than it sounds because the Bills were,62
NA,introduced previously. One of the reasons given,62
NA,for the rejection of the legislation when it was,62
NA,previously before the House was that the Oppo-,62
NA,sition believed that the changes proposed in the,62
NA,legislation should have been introduced in the,62
NA,"As I said before, I do not like increased",62
NA,charges but I realise that they are necessary.,62
Mr BOURCHIER ,Bendigo) (3.31)- I lis-,62
NA,tened with interest to the honourable member,62
NA,"for Corio ( Mr Scholes), particularly to the com-",62
NA,I bements which he made about which side of the,62
NA,Speaker's Chair he sits before he makes up his,62
NA,mind. I agree with the assessment made by my,62
NA,of coUeague the honourable member for Gippsland,62
NA,( Mr Nixon) that whUe the Opposition is not op-,62
NA,this BUl it is certainly prepared to offer,62
NA,a some comments on it. One weU recalls the,62
NA,if one Treasurer ( Mr Crean) when introducing his,62
NA,mini-Budget mentioning that the measures,63
NA,introduced were designed as anti-inflationary,63
NA,measures. The proposal to implement increased,63
NA,postal charges at that stage was defeated in the,63
NA,Senate because those increases were considered,63
NA,to be inflationary. Government supporters took,63
NA,great deUght in saying that this was a lot of rot,63
NA,and that the Opposition's atdtude on this matter,63
NA,was the result of bad organisauon. But let me,63
NA,inform the House who supported the view taken,63
NA,"by the Opposiuon. I refer, as did the honourable",63
NA,"member for Gippsland, to the Deputy Prime",63
NA,"Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS), that man of great mo-",63
NA,ment who supported the view that the increases,63
NA,were not anti-inflationary but would be infla-,63
NA,tionary. The Deputy Prime Mimster was also,63
NA,supported in that view by the Leader of the,63
NA,Government in the Senate (Senator Murphy).,63
NA,Obviously the Government did not beheve in the,63
NA,measures that it was introducing. This shows the,63
NA,hopeless mismanagement from which we suffer,63
NA,under this sodalist Government.,63
NA,The Post and Telegraph Rates BUl proposes,63
NA,several areas of increase. Firsdy it proposes,63
NA,raise the postal charge from 7c to 10c instead of,63
NA,from 7c to 9c as was proposed previously. The,63
NA,increased charge is designed to reap the same,63
NA,amount of money as would have been coUected,63
NA,over a longer term if the charge had been 9c.,63
NA,Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen),63
NA,might perhaps agree that these increases should,63
NA,be made. But it appears to me that this Governis,63
NA,"ment which is steadfastly on the side of the poor,",63
NA,"the under-privUeged and the low income-earner,",63
NA,is directly attacking those who have less money.,63
NA,A pensioner wiU have to pay 10c to post a letter.,63
NA,Perhaps the Minister in his kindness and wisdom,63
NA,might look at the possibUity of creating a second,63
NA,stamp for pensioners. But the Government is,63
NA,making an attack on the low income-earner and,63
NA,the pensioner. It is typical of all the actions which,63
NA,the Government has taken. We find that the,63
NA,Government has introduced measures in the,63
NA,"cent Budget, the mini-Budget and on other attack",63
NA,occasions over the last 12 to 18 months that have,63
NA,amounted to some UabiUty for people on the,63
NA,lower end of the income scale.,63
NA,In the last 12 months under this Government inequitable,63
NA,we have seen the Post Office discontinue to deDoes,63
NA,Uver maU on Saturday mornings. This was folthese,63
NA,lowed by the then Postmaster-General's agreefrom every,63
NA,ing with the trade unions and closing post offices to try to remain,63
NA,"on Saturday morning. Also, the",63
NA,applying pressure to try to close non-official post industry there is nobefore,63
NA,offices which are privately run and which are,63
NA,prepared to provide a necessary service to the,63
NA,pubhc. Let us face the fact that it is the ordinary,63
NA,citizen who uses the post office on a Saturday,63
NA,"morning, and not big business. So we again see",63
NA,this slanted attack on the lower income and pen-,63
NA,sioner level. Surely it is possible now for the,63
NA,"Special Minister of State who is at the table, and",63
NA,the Postmaster-General in another place to look,63
NA,at the effect ofthe increase of nearly 50 per cent,63
NA,in postal charges. In this event the Government,63
NA,might even consider re-opening post offices on,63
NA,"Saturday mornings and giving us a httle service,",63
NA,"something which is terribly lacking. However, I",63
NA,doubt that the Government would achieve that,63
NA,success and provide that service to the public.,63
NA,I refer now to bulk postage rates for,63
NA,periodicals. Again we see an attack on those who,63
NA,cannot afford it. The people who use this service,63
NA,and the people who need it are mostly charitable,63
NA,organisations that operate on a non-profit level,63
NA,and whose only means of communication with,63
NA,the public and their members is by posting,63
NA,periodical newsletters. These organisations have,63
NA,always been able to enjoy a measure of low-price,63
NA,postage. In the next 12 months the rate for,63
NA,to material of this kind willriseby 50 per cent and,63
NA,"from 1975 it wUl increase a further 33 V> per cent,",63
NA,which in total effect means that in 12 months,63
NA,there wUl be an increase of about 100 per cent.,63
NA,Telephone rental charges have increased for the,63
NA,The ordinary person from $55 a year to $75 a year.,63
NA,For business people the rental has increased,63
NA,from $55 to $85. One can understand that there,63
NA,a need for an increase considering the present,63
NA,"economic situadon, the cost of living increases",63
NA,and so on. It seems to me that a 50 per cent,63
NA,"increase is a bit steep, even in this day and age.",63
NA,Perhaps the Government has anticipated that,63
NA,the rate of inflation wUl be as high as 50 per cent.,63
NA,The Minister stated in his second reading,63
NA,speech that it was inequitable for the private,63
NA,"individuals, the residents, to bear the added cost",63
NA,increases due to the actions of the Opposition in,63
NA,rejecting the postal charges in July. The Govern-,63
NA,"rement has decided, in its undoubted desire to",63
NA,"the private sector, that it is to be the indus-",63
NA,try sector that wUl pay the added cost to make up,63
NA,the amount that is claimed to be lost. What a,63
NA,ridiculous situation we have. A Minister says it is,63
NA,for the residents to carry the cost.,63
NA,he reaUy beUeve that industry will carry all,63
NA,charges? Wage costsrisealmost weekly.,63
NA,Industry has had increased costs slanted at it,63
NA,direction. Industrial operations have,63
NA,"in business because after aU, as I",63
NA,Government is have pointed out,63
NA,"often enough, without",63
NA,employment.,63
NA,The situation is that a proportion of the costs,63
NA,wUl have to be passed on. History shows over,63
NA,and over again that if the cost of a single article is,64
NA,"increased by a very low percentage, by the time",64
NA,the article passes through the various sectors of,64
NA,"the industry, the retailers or any other organis-",64
NA,"ation, the price of it multiplies immensely. The",64
NA,"end result is that in order to protect itself, as it",64
NA,"must i f it is to survive, the charges incurred in",64
NA,carrying these costs are passed on to the public,64
NA,which will be far worse off overall. The obvious,64
NA,thing is that any cost factor must increase the,64
NA,level of inflation. It does not matter what small,64
NA,"percentage of inflationary level is achieved, it is",64
NA,still adding to the growing burden. We know that,64
NA,the Government's action towards the decen-,64
NA,tralised industries is definitely a joke. The,64
NA,Government has no real desire to decentralise,64
NA,industries.,64
Mr LUSHER ,Absolutel y not.,64
Mr BOURCHIER,"Absolutel y not, as my",64
NA,colleague says. It is a joke with this Government.,64
NA,Let us look at the 1972 election. Members of,64
NA,the Labor Party made very guarded statements.,64
NA,"They covered themselves fairly carefully, but",64
NA,that is understandable because they are a crafty,64
NA,lot. They made pseudo promises that there,64
NA,would be standard telephone charges through-,64
NA,out the country. They said they would look into,64
NA,this matter. They said that this would be the,64
NA,greatest thing for country people and industries.,64
NA,What did we find? They did not carry out that,64
NA,promise. Instead they lifted the country differen-,64
NA,"tial on telephone rentals, which meant that not",64
NA,only industries but also the poor people the,64
NA,"Government is supposed to protect, including",64
NA,"the pensioners, copped an extra blast. The",64
NA,Government has now increased rentals with no,64
NA,differential for people in the country. Country,64
NA,telephone charges are so much higher because,64
NA,country people have to make trunk-line calls,64
NA,"more often than their city competitors, but they",64
NA,will be caught up also in the web of higher tele-,64
NA,phone rentals. I suggest that the Government,64
NA,should look at the situation and try to do some-,64
NA,thing for industry.,64
NA,The cost for calls from,64
NA,risen from 5c to 10c- a mere 100 per cent,64
NA,increase. It is not a bad sort of increase. I think I,64
NA,heard the honourable member for Robertson,64
NA,( Mr Cohen) complaining about a 100 per cent,64
NA,200 per cent profit being made on imported,64
NA,goods. He should ask his own government how it,64
NA,"justifies the sort of cop now proposed. After all,",64
NA,who will pay that great charge? Surely not,64
NA,called rich person who has a telephone in his,64
NA,own home; it will be the poor people and the to,64
NA,low-income earners who will be slugged. In,64
NA,second reading speech the Minister points to an,64
NA,agreement with the Umted States and the United,64
NA,Kingdom which will enable us to have a faster,64
NA,"postal service. This will be great, because the",64
NA,quickest way to get a letter from Bendigo to Mel-,64
NA,bourne will be to post it through the U.S. It now,64
NA,takes two or three days to get a letter from Ben-,64
NA,"digo to Melbourne, so it will be a great bit of ser-",64
NA,vice. I am sure the people in my area will be de-,64
NA,lighted. It takes the people who hve 40 or 50,64
NA,miles out of Bendigo a day or two to have letters,64
NA,dehvered. Perhaps we will be able to send letters,64
NA,through the U.S. It might be a bit more expensive,64
NA,but we will be able to get a bit of service.,64
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Yo u are just hostile with,64
NA,employees.,64
Mr BOURCHIER,Th e employees are for-,64
NA,bidden from giving service because the Govern-,64
NA,ment has cut it out. The proposed improved ser-,64
NA,vice is great news. Perhaps we will find some ser-,64
NA,vice boost to our local area.,64
NA,The way we are heading reminds one of the,64
NA,situation in another country where one is lucky if,64
NA,his letter is dehvered at all after posting. Re-,64
NA,cently there was a train travelUng from town to,64
NA,"town loaded with baggage cars, each totally",64
NA,"stacked with maU, because the postal authorities",64
NA,under that particular sociahst government were,64
NA,so lax and disorganised that the easiest way of,64
NA,getting rid of maU was to put it on the train and,64
NA,send it off. A lot of that maU was lost completely,64
NA,because it was on that train. I hope that the,64
NA,Postmaster-General's Department does not get,64
NA,to this tragic stage. Let us hope it takes some,64
NA,positive steps to promote something that the,64
NA,people in this country need-a n efficient service-,64
NA,instead of driving them to outside services. The,64
NA,Government always wants to attack industry. I,64
NA,think it was the honourable member for Corio,64
NA,( Mr Scholes) who mentioned something about,64
NA,the private industry sector taking business away.,64
NA,Do honourable members blame industry for,64
NA,going to private organisations when they wUl,64
NA,pubhc telephones has give service?,64
NA,People in the major areas of Melbourne and,64
NA,Sydney are paying considerably more to use the,64
NA,to private service to distribute their document,64
NA,exchange because they can get service when they,64
NA,want it. They are prepared to pay for it. This is a,64
NA,great loss to the postal organisation. Service is,64
NA,the sosomething that unfortunately this Government,64
NA,seems to lack. The increases proposed wUl lead,64
NA,a 0.3 per cent increase in the cost price index. It,64
NA,"his is not a very great percentage, but as I said",64
NA,earlier it will build up and will add to the grow-,65
NA,ing amount of inflation. If automatic wage inde-,65
NA,xation were introduced-th e Government seems,65
NA,to be a httle partial to that-th e result would be a,65
NA,0.4 per cent increase in wages. Who bears that,65
NA,"cost? The pubhc, again, or industry, which in",65
NA,turn passes it on. What about the possible and,65
NA,probable demand by unions for extra wages over,65
NA,and above indexation? It is unbelievable that the,65
NA,Government will put up charges without there,65
NA,being an immediate demand by all the unions,65
NA,concerned with the Post Office for increased,65
NA,wages. I would say that a fairly large demand,65
NA,will be made within one week.,65
NA,Finally I would comment that if this case had,65
NA,been considered by the Prices Justification Tri-,65
NA,bunal in its existing role it probably would have,65
NA,disallowed that part of the price increase that,65
NA,was based on cost increases which are not yet,65
NA,officially certain. The Minister said that the,65
NA,increases were required to ensure that the rates,65
NA,which customers pay for Post Office services are,65
NA,sufficient to cover costs and also to provide a sur-,65
NA,plus which can be re-invested to help meet the,65
NA,growing demand for services. He also indicated,65
NA,that the new charges were based pardy on likely,65
NA,increases in wage rates and were designed to give,65
NA,"an expected profit of $60m. In other words, the",65
NA,whole exercise has been based on probable,65
NA,increases. Surely to goodness that is a backward,65
NA,approach to the matter. An alternative method,65
NA,may have been to obtain funds for future capital,65
NA,investment by borrowing. I do not know whether,65
NA,this was considered. It would appear to me that,65
NA,there could be some advantage in borrowing,65
NA,"funds, covering interest rates and repayments",65
NA,over a period and carrying them at a much less,65
NA,cost to the pubhc in general,65
Mr KEOGH ,Bowman) (3.45)-Let me ex-,65
NA,plain what would happen if we foUowed the,65
NA,logic of some of the arguments put forward by,65
NA,the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr,65
NA,"Bourchier). In his remarks on this legislation, he",65
NA,suggested that the increased postal charges,65
NA,would contribute very greatly to the inflationary,65
NA,situation in AustraUa. The obvious consequence,65
NA,is that if the Government could decrease its,65
NA,charges sufficiently it might cure inflation. That is,65
NA,an example of the negative type of thinking,65
NA,which the Opposition constantly puts forward in,65
NA,this chamber.,65
NA,The honourable member went on to say-h e,65
NA,had some agreement from one of his colleagues,65
NA,whom we have come to know quite well in the,65
NA,short period that he has been here for his,65
NA,ridiculous interjections-tha t this Government,65
NA,had no interest in decentralisation. That remark,65
NA,was so stupid that it wasridiculousin the ex-,65
NA,treme. It is a pity that the honourable member,65
NA,has not been in the House on more frequent,65
NA,occasions to hear debate on legislation,65
NA,introduced by the Minister for Urban and,65
NA,Regional Development ( Mr Uren). It is a pity,65
NA,that the honourable member did not take the op-,65
NA,portunity in the last couple of days to note some,65
NA,of the real development that has been proposed,65
NA,by this Government for the Albury-Wodonga,65
NA,area. It is unfortunate that he did not reflect on,65
NA,the pitiful record of his own Liberal-Country,65
NA,"Party Government which, in the 11th hour of its",65
NA,"great number of years in office, suddenly found",65
NA,an interest in decentralisation when it realised,65
NA,that that issue would be a real election winner for,65
NA,the Labor Party in 1972.,65
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Drury)-I ask,65
NA,the honourable member to relate bis remarks to,65
NA,the BUls now before the House which deal with,65
NA,posts and telegraphs.,65
Mr KEOGH,"I accept what you say, Mr",65
NA,"Deputy Speaker, but I might say as justification",65
NA,for my remarks on those matters that I was reply-,65
NA,ing to some of the comments made by the pre-,65
NA,"vious speaker, the honourable member for Ben-",65
NA,digo.,65
NA,The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr,65
NA,"Nixon), who led for the Opposition parties in this",65
NA,"debate, contrasted the attitude of the Opposition",65
NA,on this occasion with its attitude to these pro-,65
NA,posals when they were last before the Parlia-,65
NA,"ment. On that occasion, the Opposition parties in",65
NA,the Senate decided to use their numbers to pre-,65
NA,vent this Goverament from obtaining the pass-,65
NA,age of the legislation proposing increased postal,65
NA,charges as they were detaUed in what is com-,65
NA,monly known as the 'mini-Budget' which was,65
NA,introduced in July this year. On this occasion the,65
NA,Opposition parties take a different attitude and,65
NA,will aUow these measures to be passed.,65
NA,Members ofthe Opposition must bear in mind,65
NA,that their decision to prevent the passage of these,65
NA,measures in July is the major contributing factor,65
NA,why some additional charges had to be added on,65
NA,tbis occasion. The reasons for those increases in,65
NA,postal charges have been explained by the,65
NA,Special Minister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen).,65
NA,"The new ordinary letter rate of 9c, proposed in",65
NA,"July, has been increased to 10c in this legislation.",65
NA,I instance that in explanation of what the real,65
NA,situation is.,65
NA,The action of the Senate in July with respect to,65
NA,these charges is typical of how the Opposition,65
NA,"has behaved, particularly since the last election.",65
NA,It operates somewhat as a government in exUe.,65
NA,Its action in the Senate in July in rejecting the,66
NA,measures introduced by the Government showed,66
NA,it was behaving in a rather irresponsible fashion.,66
NA,This was well known and publicly proclaimed in,66
NA,those days not just by speakers from the Govern-,66
NA,ment side in this House and in the Senate but in,66
NA,fact by the national Press.,66
NA,It was well recognised in those days that the,66
NA,decision by the Government was a responsible,66
NA,one. It was in keeping with the statement by the,66
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Whitlam) at the Premiers,66
NA,Conference on 7 June when he let the Premiers,66
NA,know quite clearly that the attitude of this,66
NA,Government would be to ensure that it made de-,66
NA,"partments providing pubhc services, such as the",66
NA,"Post Office, pay their way. He also clearly indi-",66
NA,cated to the Premiers that he would expect that,66
NA,"they would balance their budgets, would make a",66
NA,real effort to see that departments in the various,66
NA,States which were expending large sums of,66
NA,"money would adopt a more responsible attitude,",66
NA,and would make sure that they were able to raise,66
NA,"revenue to match that expenditure. So, the de-",66
NA,cision announced by the Prime Mimster at that,66
NA,"Premiers Conference, when he made it publicly",66
NA,known that the appropriation for the Post Office,66
NA,in the 1974-75 Budget would be held at last,66
NA,"year's level of $385m, was instrumental in ensur-",66
NA,ing that the legislation came forward as quickly,66
NA,as possible. It was introduced into this chamber,66
NA,in our July sittings.,66
NA,We have today the need to consider fresh,66
NA,legislation because the Government was,66
NA,prevented in July from enacting the legislation,66
NA,proposing those increased charges. It is all very,66
NA,well for the Opposition to claim that on this,66
NA,occasion it is going to do a great service by allow-,66
NA,ing the Government's legislation to pass and to,66
NA,"become law, while pointing out the injustices of",66
NA,the increase. It is as well to remind the Oppo-,66
NA,sition that some proportion of the charges which,66
NA,were proposed in the July measures and which,66
NA,are repeated in these measures are charges the,66
NA,introduction of which was delayed for over 12,66
NA,months by the then Postmaster-General-th e,66
NA,present Special Minister of State sitting at the,66
NA,table-a s those measures were to be associated,66
NA,"with the 1973-74 Budget which, I would remind",66
NA,"honourable members, was thefirstBudget of this",66
NA,Labor Government.,66
NA,The then Postmaster-General clearly indi-,66
NA,cated to the House that definite proposals had,66
NA,been put forward to the previous Postmaster-,66
NA,General-the y were documented and made,66
NA,available to Mr Lionel Bowen as Postmaster-,66
NA,General when he assumed that responsibility;,66
NA,and it was he who made these disclosures-t o,66
NA,provide for increases of between 25 per cent and,66
NA,30 per cent in postal charges. If the Liberal-,66
NA,Country Party Government had remained in,66
NA,"office following the 1972 election, those new",66
NA,charges would have been introduced in the,66
NA,1973-74 Budget. But the imposition of those,66
NA,"charges, proposed for that Budget, were held",66
NA,over by this Government. It is only now that the,66
NA,Government has faced the need to increase the,66
NA,various postal and other charges associated with,66
NA,these charges.,66
NA,Some of the money problems that confront us,66
NA,today in the administration of the Post Office are,66
NA,shortly to be overcome. This will result from the,66
NA,responsible decision made by this Government,66
NA,soon after it came to power to appoint a royal,66
NA,commission to inquire into the Australian Post,66
NA,Office. The report of that royal commission is,66
NA,well known to honourable members and the de-,66
NA,cision of the Government following the receipt of,66
NA,"that report is well known also. Before very long,",66
NA,legislation will be introduced to provide for the,66
NA,restructuring of what we know today as the vari-,66
NA,ous services of the Post Office into 2 separate,66
NA,commissions. While that action will not solve all,66
NA,"the problems of the Post Office, it will go a long",66
NA,way towards solving some of the problems that,66
NA,have been commented on by honourable,66
NA,members opposite and also some of the prob-,66
NA,lems that we recognise do exist today. There is no,66
NA,running away from the fact that the charges that,66
NA,have been introduced in these measures have,66
NA,been introduced in an effort to adopt a respon-,66
NA,sible attitude towards the need of the Post Office,66
NA,"to pay its way, to ensure that it is able to meet its",66
NA,commitments from the charges it imposes. We,66
NA,reject absolutely the principle we saw put into,66
NA,operation so often by the previous Government,66
NA,of making the taxpayers foot the bill for some of,66
NA,the very privileged measures that were,66
NA,introduced from time to time. Some of those,66
NA,measures prevented people in electorates such as,66
NA,the one I represent getting what might be refer-,66
NA,red to as a fair share ofthe Post Office cake. For a,66
NA,number of years I sat in this chamber and in,66
NA,Budget after Budget saw the situation of my elec-,66
NA,torate of Bowman-an d in general the position in,66
NA,Queensland followed a similar pattern-de -,66
NA,teriorate year by year. Year by year the provision,66
NA,of telephone services to people in oudying metro-,66
NA,poUtan areas clearly got worse and worse. I dealt,66
NA,with this at some length in a previous Budget de-,66
NA,"bate, in 1972 I think. On that occasion the",66
NA,estimated demand in the previous year for tele-,66
NA,"phone services of 33,250 had fallen some 4,000",66
NA,"short of the actual demand of over 37,000. I",66
NA,ascertained from avaUable statistics that this was,66
NA,a general pattern and it has got worse and worse,67
NA,year by year. When I sought a reasonable expla-,67
NA,nation for this through various means available,67
NA,to me I found that the obvious answer was that,67
NA,people in these areas were not being given the,67
NA,share of the Budget that they should have been,67
NA,getting. They were not being given the oppor-,67
NA,tunity to have the lines and the services made,67
NA,available to them through the establishment of,67
NA,"new telephone exchanges, simply because of the",67
NA,discriminatory pohcies of the previous Govern-,67
NA,ment.,67
NA,I refer particularly to the famous country line,67
NA,program that was introduced. It was introduced,67
NA,unashamedly by the then Postmaster-General at,67
NA,the behest of the Country Party to provide a commitment,67
NA,measure of service to country areas. I am sure we,67
NA,would all recognise that it was good to be able to,67
NA,provide some service for them but this measure,67
NA,of service was provided in a fashion that,67
NA,discriminated most severely against the people,67
NA,the metropoUtan fringe areas and in many other,67
NA,developing areas throughout the length and,67
NA,"breadth of Austraha, to the extent that they just",67
NA,could not get telephones. They waited the,67
NA,reasonable time of 4 years or more for the,67
NA,connection of a telephone to their homes.,67
NA,"I am particularly pleased to see that finally,",67
NA,after aU the years I have been watching the situhas,67
NA,"ation, a point was reached in Queensland where",67
NA,the demand for 1973-74 was just about a line,67
NA,baU with the estimated demand. The estimated,67
NA,demand disclosed in the previous Budget Papers,67
NA,"was for 57,000 connections in Queensland-",67
NA,refer to appUcations for telephone services,67
NA,involving the provision of new Unes or equiptricity,67
NA,ment. The actual demand for 1973-74 amounted,67
NA,"to 56,151 telephones, so finally, because of the",67
NA,"introduction of pohcies by this Government,",67
NA,people in these areas are starting to get a fair,67
NA,They are getting to a point where they have a,67
NA,reasonable chance of getting a telephone. It is,67
NA,not just my opinion that the reason they were at,67
NA,disadvantage previously was that the Postmasdivisions,67
NA,ter-General was prepared to instruct his officers,67
NA,to give preference to very expensive connections,67
NA,of services to remote station properties. This was in,67
NA,"obvious from the information avaUable to us. I ments, have",67
NA,refer to a letter I received,67
NA,"Posts and Telegraphs in Brisbane dated 13 July Ught, electricity,services",67
NA,"1972 in reply to representations I had made couples buy thesegas,",67
NA,about telephone services in the metropoUtan thinking that theyblocks,67
NA,area that had been delayed for a considerable than what is put forward to themanything are,67
NA,time. The letter said:,67
NA,It is agreed that the preferred arrangement would,67
NA,"build-up adequate, resources",67
NA,"is being done to the maximum extent possible, within the",67
NA,limitations of available finance.,67
NA,The Director went on to disclose the reaUties of,67
NA,the situation by saying:,67
NA,The position is particularly acute in Queensland in compari-,67
NA,son to other States-,67
NA,And well I knew that from the fact that we were,67
NA,falling further and further behind year by year,67
NA,when comparing demand to estimated demand.,67
NA,He continued:,67
NA,The position is particularly acute in Queensland in compari-,67
NA,son to other States as we have had a relatively high level of,67
NA,demand for telephone service over a lengthy period.,67
NA,I recognise that also. The letter went on to say:,67
NA,The recent legislation governing the provision of rural,67
NA,telephone services has also resulted in a huge depanmental,67
NA,in Queensland relative to most other States.,67
NA,"Clearly, the representations of the honourable",67
NA,"member for Maranoa ( Mr Corbett), whom I",67
NA,understand was principally responsible for the,67
NA,in introduction of the discrimination in favour of,67
NA,"country lines, were successful in respect of the",67
NA,area about which he was concerned at the ex-,67
NA,pense of areas such as those represented by me,67
NA,unand the honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr,67
NA,"simple Robinson), whom I know would readUy agree",67
NA,with me about the problems confronting people,67
NA,in the fringe metropoUtan areas in obtaining tele-,67
NA,phone services. I am not saying that the problem,67
NA,been entirely solved but I am delighted to see,67
NA,that a situation exists now where finally we have,67
NA,caught up with demand. We can look forward,67
NA,now to seeing people moving into homes in the,67
NA,new suburbs of our cities being able to get tele-,67
NA,I phones in the relatively near future with the,67
NA,same ease as they are able to get water or elec-,67
NA,"laid on. As far as I am concerned, this",67
NA,essential service should be avaUable to them as,67
NA,readUy as other services. There is absolutely no,67
NA,the excuse for this not being so.,67
NA,go. I do not want to indicate that I am laying the,67
NA,entire blame for the situation on the administra-,67
NA,tion of the Post Office. I recognise that there is a,67
NA,"a real problem, particularly in respect of some sub-",67
NA,that are developed by the types of,67
NA,developers who completely lack any conscience,67
NA,these matters. I am sure most honourable,67
NA,"members, when driving past residential develop-",67
NA,seen the very attractive bUlboards as,67
NA,from the Director of claiming 'All,67
NA,"available-telephone ,",67
NA,etc.'. Unfortunate young,67
NA,of residential land not,67
NA,buying,67
NA,on the,67
NA,other,67
NA,attract-,67
NA,ive brochures they get or on the attractive hoard-,67
NA,ings showing the alleged dehghts of the sites they,67
NA,be to are about to purchase. They do not realise that,67
NA,within the Department and this,67
NA,"they are being hoodwinked by the developers,",68
NA,many of whom have not even bothered to con-,68
NA,tact the Post Office tofindout if these services are,68
NA,available. The developers beheve they can mis-,68
NA,"lead the purchasers of the land, who unknow-",68
NA,"ingly take them at their word, purchase the land",68
NA,and find that the services are not available.,68
NA,I think I mentioned this point to the Minister,68
NA,previously when he held the portfoho. As he now,68
NA,represents the Postmaster-General in this,68
NA,chamber I might suggest it to him again. I ask,68
NA,that he take whatever action it is possible for him,68
NA,to take to see that there is a better liaison be-,68
NA,tween the local authorities and the Postmaster-,68
NA,General's Department. I ask that he explore,68
NA,every avenue available to hin to see whether it is,68
NA,possible for the local authorities to lay down,68
NA,some clear and definite terms for developers of,68
NA,new estates to ensure that where it is not possible,68
NA,for the Postmaster-General's Department to,68
NA,provide these services within a reasonable,68
NA,time- I agree that at times it may not be pos-,68
NA,sible-thi s is clearly indicated to the local auth-,68
NA,ority and some enforcement or restriction is,68
NA,placed on the developers to ensure that they will,68
NA,"tell the truth, the factual story, to people purchas-",68
NA,ing home sites. Purchasers of blocks of land,68
NA,would then know that a telephone connection,68
NA,would not be available. They would know that,68
NA,because of a lack of telephone exchange equip-,68
NA,"ment, trunk hne or minor equipment a telephone",68
NA,service might not be available for some years,68
NA,hence. If these details were known to purchasers,68
NA,the Department would be relieved of some bur-,68
NA,den of blame. Whilst I am happy to hear from,68
NA,my constituents many of them would be saved,68
NA,the trouble of ringing my office to find out that,68
NA,they have been hoodwinked and treacherously,68
NA,tricked by the developers.,68
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Drury)-Order!,68
NA,The honourable member'stimehas expired.,68
Mr GILES ,Angas) (4.6)- I always admire,68
NA,persons like the honourable member for Bow-,68
NA,man ( Mr Keogh) and the honourable member,68
NA,for Corio ( Mr Scholes) who try to justify a,68
NA,Government decision when it is tough and un-,68
NA,"popular. I wul, therefore, be far more moderate",68
NA,in my comments about their speeches than I,68
NA,"would otherwise have been. It would be wrong,",68
NA,"however, i f l were to let some of their remarks go",68
NA,without some form of reply. The honourable,68
NA,member for Bowman made a most ihurninating,68
NA,remark. Whilst the Opposition was blamed for,68
NA,"delaying postal increases for 4 weeks, he",68
NA,explained that the Postmaster-General himself,68
NA,delayed such increases for a period of 12 months.,68
NA,I invite the House to compare the amount of the,68
NA,proposed increases attributed to the Opposition,68
NA,for the delaying their imposition with the total,68
NA,amount involved. It is almost as much as that fpr,68
NA,which the Postmaster-General can be held re-,68
NA,sponsible for delaying the increases. So let us,68
NA,have no more nonsense about what the Oppo-,68
NA,sition did or did not do. We are happy that we,68
NA,gave business people and other people a chance,68
NA,to get their houses in order and a lot of their work,68
NA,done in the certain knowledge that increases in,68
NA,various telecommunication and postal facility,68
NA,charges would be introduced in this Budget.,68
NA,Today the honourable member for Bowman,68
NA,complained bitterly about everything the Oppo-,68
NA,sition did and then admitted that the Govern-,68
NA,ment also was to blame. The Government has a,68
NA,job to do and we do not oppose it on this,68
NA,occasion.,68
NA,It is only right that I should do as the honour-,68
NA,able member for Bowman did on behalf of his,68
NA,"electorate, on behalf of Brisbane and perhaps on",68
NA,behalf of Queensland and make one or two com-,68
NA,ments in relation to my own area. He said that at,68
NA,long last he feels that his electorate is getting a,68
NA,fair go with respect to telephone connections. Let,68
NA,me instance a case with which I have been con-,68
NA,cerned and ask him whether his definition of a,68
NA,fair go applies. I have made representations on,68
NA,behalf of a young doctor who has been,68
NA,appointed to a modern hospital in Adelaide.,68
NA,Telephone cables passed through the end of his,68
NA,block which is 4 miles from the centre of the,68
NA,fairly major town of Murray Bridge. He applied,68
NA,for a telephone connection expecting to be char-,68
NA,ged between perhaps $200 and $400 for it. He,68
NA,"was asked to pay $8,000 for the connection. I",68
NA,stress that his block was within 4 miles of Murray,68
NA,"Bridge, telephone cables went through the end of",68
NA,it and within a few yards of his house. The,68
NA,honourable member for Bowman spoke of a fair,68
NA,deal for his people. He can hardly blame a Lib-,68
NA,"eral member, not a Country Party member, for",68
NA,asking what is fair. There are people in my elec-,68
NA,torate which is comparatively close to Adelaide,68
NA,who are being asked for sums in excess of,68
NA,"$ 10,000 for telephone connections.",68
Mr JAMES ,The y have a quid too.,68
Mr GILES,I know that the honourable,68
NA,member for Hunter is a fair man so I ask him:,68
NA,What is fair? Is it not reasonable that a person,68
NA,who can catch public transport to work in the,68
NA,morning but who may choose to use his own ve-,68
NA,hicle should perhaps pay a share of the total cost,68
NA,of telephone facility installations? That is the sort,68
NA,of principle that was adopted in the past. The,68
NA,honourable member for Bowman said that at,68
NA,long last he thought that people in his electorate,68
NA,seeking telephone connections were getting a fan-,69
NA,go. Perhaps I may comment on this aspect. South,69
NA,Austraha has been wonderfully well served by 2,69
NA,marveUous Directors of Posts and Telegraphs.,69
NA,The performance in South Austraha has been,69
NA,"second to none but now, for the first time in my",69
NA,"experience of the last 10 years, the fringe areas",69
NA,Adelaide are suffering. Switchboards do not,69
NA,have sufficient capacity and work has not kept up,69
NA,to programs. I think it reasonable to ask why. I,69
NA,am no expert on these matters and I was not hel-,69
NA,ped on this occasion by discovering from the Par-,69
NA,Uamentary Library that I could not get the Year,69
NA,Book for 1973-74. The last one I could get was,69
NA,presented in June 1973.,69
NA,Mr Keogh-Ther e is a shortage of labour.,69
Mr GILES, I do not know the reason but it,69
NA,makes life difficult for someone like me who,69
NA,wants to debate these measures. From the figures,69
NA,avaUable it is my understanding that the subven-,69
NA,tion from revenue for the Post Office in 1973-74,69
NA,was of the order of $385m. The subvention for,69
NA,1974-75 is again $385m. To thesefiguresmust,69
NA,be added the internaUy generated funds of the,69
NA,Post Office as a whole. Then we must ask what,69
NA,performance we can expect from such allo-,69
NA,cations. I know that the present Government be-,69
NA,Ueves that users should pay for facUities. Ifindit,69
NA,"hard to argue against that view. However, ac-",69
NA,"cording to the Treasury figures in the Budget,",69
NA,"which is only 48 hours old, there wUl be an",69
NA,increase of 42.5 per cent in taxation receipts this,69
NA,"year. Notwithstanding this fact, the Government",69
NA,has allowed no more to the Postmaster-,69
NA,General's Department this year. It seems to me,69
NA,that this is inequitable. Atfirstglance it appears,69
NA,that the Department has not been given a fair go.,69
NA,The whole Budget is based on the assumption,69
NA,that inflation will increase by slightly more than,69
NA,20 per cent during the next 12 months. How can,69
NA,$385m plus internaUy generated funds produce,69
NA,the performance required? It is common knowl-,69
NA,edge from open discussion in my electorate in the,69
NA,fringe areas of Adelaide that one cannot get per-,69
NA,formance if one does not have the funds. I can,69
NA,understand the difficulties of the Department.,69
NA,This year there have been enormous increases in,69
NA,"wage costs, and I do not object to them, but to",69
NA,have a situation where funds aUocated for this,69
NA,Department are the same as for last year seems,69
NA,to me to be letting down the entire system. Obvi-,69
NA,ously the performance cannot be as great as it,69
NA,was last year. People in country areas know very,69
NA,well what the Government is proposing and,69
NA,doing. Let us face it; the previous Government,69
NA,was culpable too. It was too good an idea for,69
NA,amount of revenue that the Post Office could at-,69
NA,tract into that area. This was well understood in,69
NA,country areas. But unless the extra amount which,69
NA,the Government has tacked on during the last 4,69
NA,"weeks, and for which it has blamed us, is going to",69
NA,earn a lot more than any projection that one can,69
NA,"of find in the Vernon report, we wiU not have the",69
NA,capital requirements to do the job effectively.,69
NA,That is really the only point I properly wanted to,69
NA,make. I hope that I am not wide in the facts that I,69
NA,"have been able to glean but, as I say, I have not",69
NA,been able to get hold of what I imagine is the,69
NA,latest annual report from the Department. This,69
NA,has made it rather difficult for me to draw a,69
NA,proper comparison.,69
NA,The only other matter I wanted to discuss at all,69
NA,today arises from the remarks of the honourable,69
NA,member for Corio and the honourable member,69
NA,for Bowman. It has to do with what functions the,69
NA,Postmaster-General's Department should,69
NA,undertake and what functions it should not. We,69
NA,have already discussed- I hope we have done it,69
NA,properly-whethe r or not the Government has,69
NA,"the funds to do the job and, if so, where they are",69
NA,to come from.,69
NA,The next point I wish to make is that if the De-,69
NA,partment were not so ambitious to protect its role,69
NA,in life I think more funds would be avaUable. Let,69
NA,me make one or two suggestions to the Depart-,69
NA,"ment. It is not the first time I have commented,",69
NA,"for instance, on householder deliveries on behalf",69
NA,of various country newspapers in my area. I have,69
NA,been doing this on and off for some years. All,69
NA,country newspapers look on the competition they,69
NA,get from the Postmaster-General's Department,69
NA,as spoUing their competitive position entirely.,69
NA,Fromtimeimmemorial stores have advertised in,69
NA,the local newspaper. Chain stores rather altered,69
NA,"the situation, but chain stores used to advertise in",69
NA,the local newspaper. With the advent of chain,69
NA,stores came the householder deUvery. Some,69
NA,"people tended to use that system, which deprived",69
NA,provincial newspapers of a lot of their revenue. I,69
NA,just make the point in passing: Does the Depart-,69
NA,ment reaUy need to be in this role or could it save,69
NA,staffing if it were not involved in it? I do not,69
NA,know that I am interested in or that I wish to pro-,69
NA,tect red telephones. They always seemed rather,69
NA,extraneous to me. But I presume that the need for,69
NA,red telephones has arisen because the com-,69
NA,munity does not think that the facUities are being,69
NA,supplied by the Post Office. By and large I think,69
NA,members of the public are prepared to pay i f,69
NA,they get an efficient service. I will touch on that,69
NA,matter again in a minute.,69
NA,We now have the intrusion of the Postmaster-,69
NA,the General's Department into the field of courier,69
NA,services. Why did they arise? They probably,70
NA,arose before the system of'Priority Paid' mail,70
NA,was introduced. Might I compliment the Depart-,70
NA,ment on the efficiency of the deliverytimesof,70
NA,'Priority Paid' mail. I use that service quite con-,70
NA,sistently. It cost me a great deal but it is a very,70
NA,efficient service and it takes a matter of hours for,70
NA,mail posted in South Australia to arrive here. I,70
NA,repeat that I do not think people mind paying,70
NA,when a matter of some urgency crops up if the,70
NA,"service is efficient. I do not object to that, but",70
NA,"do we now need sums of money available, wliich",70
NA,"are specified in these documents, to set up a cour-",70
NA,ier service to be administered by the Post Office?,70
NA,"My argument here, which touches on house-",70
NA,"holder deliveries to a lesser extent, courier ser-",70
NA,"vices and other similar services, is that surely",70
NA,payers' funds or loan funds can be saved if some,70
NA,"of this side-th e fringe side, if you like-o f the",70
NA,service of the Post Office were retained in the pri-,70
NA,vate sector. If the private sector can do it and if,70
NA,people use it and if it costs the Department,70
NA,"money to organise this, I do not think the tax-",70
NA,payer should be strained by providing facilities,70
NA,to set it up. That probably points up the deep,70
NA,philosophical difference between people on our,70
NA,side of the Parhament and people on the other,70
NA,side.,70
NA,I f l might get a httle tougher perhaps I would,70
NA,finish by saying that the honourable member for,70
NA,Bowman could not quite see the,70
NA,the honourable member for Bendigo ( Mr,70
NA,Bourchier) when he touched on the matter of de-,70
NA,centralisation. I appreciate by the look on your,70
NA,"face, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have to",70
NA,within fairly close bounds when dealing with,70
NA,honourable member's remarks. Let us face it;,70
NA,just in my httle neck of the woods-i n my commetropoUtan,70
NA,"paratively unimportant electorate, I suppose-",70
NA,this Government has already taxed the brandy,70
NA,"industry out of existence, or very nearly so. It",70
NA,put up the price of petrol in country areas by,70
NA,"ing away the country subsidy, resulting in",70
NA,increase of up to 27c a gallon in the Northern,70
NA,Territory. The removal of taxation concessions,70
NA,has taken away the Uquidity of many farmers,70
NA,whose back many big country towns are founded,70
NA,today. So that affects the entire economy in,70
NA,"towns Uke Murray Bridge, Renmark, OodGoverment",70
NA,"nawoopwoop, or wherever else one may go.",70
NA,The Government has presided over the almost,70
NA,complete ruination of the Australian,70
NA,This does not affect so much those people who,70
NA,are protected in the electorate of my friend from,70
NA,Bowman but it does affect the people who are in,70
NA,"private business, whether that business be in",70
NA,"main street or whether it be a rural one, in my",70
NA,sort of electorate. I wiU leave aside mentioning,70
NA,"obvious things such as superphosphate, because",70
NA,the price has already increased from $ 15.50 a ton,70
NA,4 months ago to $45.50 a ton now. I wUl leave,70
NA,"that aside but wUl get to the fact that in my State,",70
NA,"anyway, elected Labor Party senators and others",70
NA,in the State field are refusing to attend growers',70
NA,meetings when they wish to register their pro-,70
NA,tests. Do not let us ever wonder why there is un-,70
NA,happiness with this Government in those areas.,70
NA,"why It is very real, and people like me are trying to",70
NA,advise the growers not to strike and withhold,70
NA,"goods from the city. Anyway, it would be coun-",70
NA,ter-productive. I think we are winning that fight.,70
NA,"But they must be allowed the right to protest,",70
NA,and they wUl protest tremendously when every,70
NA,tax- country investment in a country town is hit by,70
NA,"increased telephone charges or, if you like, petrol",70
NA,"charges, because people in those areas use those",70
NA,facUities almost entirely for their job-t o earn,70
NA,their income.,70
Mr JAMES ,Bu t they have other privileges.,70
Mr GILES,The y do not have the privilege of,70
NA,television in some cases. The do not have the,70
NA,provision of public transport. They do not have,70
NA,the provision of cheapness of commuting from,70
NA,"one area to another, and in these areas the ma-",70
NA,jority of their costs of production is involved in,70
NA,point made by this sort of thing.,70
NA,I think probably one of the sUliest remarks I,70
NA,heard- I will not say who made it; it was made a,70
NA,keep little whUe ago-cam e from an honourable,70
NA,the member on the other side of the House who,70
NA,pointed to the importance of the telephone to a,70
NA,"household. I do not deny that but,",70
NA,"let us face it, if anyone asked me whether it was",70
NA,more important that Mrs Joe Blow should be,70
NA,has able to discuss why she and her neighbour lost 5c,70
NA,takat bridge the previous evening or the sorts of,70
NA,an costs that an industry has to meet in country,70
NA,areas to carry out its job under these new pro-,70
NA,"visions that we are debating today, I would have",70
NA,on to say that there is no comparison. The honour-,70
NA,able member for Bowman said that he was glad,70
NA,to see fairness of supply. AU we seek is that the,70
NA,in the future look at the fairness of all,70
NA,"people in AustraUa, that it ensures that there is",70
NA,fair treatment for all of them instead of what,70
NA,seems to us to be a buUding up against one sec-,70
NA,economy. tion of the community at present.,70
NA,I hope that I have tried to be pleasant and,70
NA,the objective. I hope that thefiguresI have are not,70
NA,"too far off the mark. If they are, I apologise, but it",70
NA,is due to the fact that the annual report of the De-,71
NA,partment has not been available from the Parha-,71
NA,mentary Library today for me to study the facts,71
NA,and figures as I would like to.,71
Mr MORRIS ,Shortland) (4.25)-I will be,71
NA,brief in my remarks as the Special Minister of,71
NA,State ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has requested. The,71
NA,refusal of the Senate to ratify the proposed postal,71
NA,charges in July last can only be described at best,71
NA,as irresponsible and typical of the course of bull-,71
NA,headed obstructionism that has been pursued by,71
NA,the Opposiuon in the Senate since December,71
NA,1972. The Opposiuon has aptly been described,71
NA,as trying to operate as a government in exile in,71
NA,another place. The editorial of the Melbourne,71
NA,'Age' of 1 August was appropriate when it said:,71
NA,Higher postal charges are not so much a part of the,71
NA,Government's anti-inflationary program as a first step,71
NA,towards making the Post Office commercially,71
NA,"viable . . . Significantly, the Opposition did not",71
NA,oppose the increased postal charges in the House of,71
NA,Representauves. Their rejection in the Senate must be seen,71
NA,as a tactical manoeuvre based on opportunism rather than a,71
NA,valid objection based on reason or pnnciple.,71
NA,At the time of the Senate's rejection last July of,71
NA,"the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill of 1974, it was",71
NA,anticipated that if rates were not increased then,71
NA,the Australian Post Office could expect a loss of,71
NA,approximately $134m in 1974-75. Honourable,71
NA,members will recall that a few weeks later when,71
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Whidam) announced,71
NA,the deferment of the Government's child care,71
NA,"proposals, the same Opposition set up a phoney",71
NA,outcry against this Government. The total cost of,71
NA,the child care program as promised in the elec-,71
NA,tion campaign of May last was almost equal to,71
NA,the loss anticipated to be incurred by the Aus-,71
NA,trahan Post Office. It would seem that the Oppo-,71
NA,sition's priorities then were that postal charges,71
NA,should be lowered at the expense of a total child,71
NA,care program because it cannot have it both,71
NA,ways. Whilst good arguments can be put forward,71
NA,that postal services ought to be considered as a,71
NA,social service on the one hand or as a straight,71
NA,"business undertaking on the other, the reality is",71
NA,that both points of view are incompatible. It is,71
NA,reasonable that the user of services ought to bear,71
NA,the major share of the cost of providing the ser-,71
NA,vices and not the general taxpayer. Hence there,71
NA,is a necessity for increased rates and charges.,71
NA,The Austrahan Post Office is the nation's lar-,71
NA,"gest business operation. On average, in excess of",71
NA,"5,000 letters are distributed and more than 6,000",71
NA,telephone calls are completed every minute of,71
NA,"every day. As such, the operation of the Post",71
NA,Office is a highly labour-intensive operation and,71
NA,depends much more on the willing co-operation,71
NA,of many people of differing skills and back-,71
NA,ground. Because about 70 per cent of its operat-,71
NA,ing costs are expended on labour and as com-,71
NA,"munity wage levels are rising, increasing costs",71
NA,are inevitable. Thefinancialdilemma facing the,71
NA,Australian Post Office is not unique among the,71
NA,industrialised nations of the world. This is refer-,71
NA,red to by the Vernon Commission in its report on,71
NA,page 52. The problem in Australia has been that,71
NA,the Austrahan Post Office for far too long has,71
NA,been administered as a private political preserve,71
NA,of the Austrahan Country Party. It was managed,71
NA,in line with pohcies that were based on poUtical,71
NA,motives rather than on sound commercial prac-,71
NA,tice. One does not need to go beyond the highly,71
NA,expensive country telephone program initiated,71
NA,in 1970-71 tofindinstances where it would have,71
NA,been Uterally a better proposition for the Post,71
NA,Office to have bought the farm than to have,71
NA,incurred the cost of providing a telephone.,71
NA,Mention must be made also of the decision in,71
NA,1971 to increase the Government's share of pen-,71
NA,sions and the decision of the Liberal-Country,71
NA,Party Government in 1972 to appoint Professor,71
NA,A. H. PoUard to inquire into methods of adjust-,71
NA,ing Commonwealth superannuation benefits.,71
NA,Resulting from his recommendations was the,71
NA,Superannuation Act 1973.1 know that members,71
NA,of the Country Party are not interested. That is,71
NA,why they are leaving the chamber. The Superan-,71
NA,nuation Act 1973 provided for staff pensions to,71
NA,be adjusted by 1.4timesthe percentage increase,71
NA,in the consumer price index. These actions,71
NA,increased future payments to past and present,71
NA,Post Office employees. Accordingly there has,71
NA,had to be a sharp increase in Post Office pay-,71
NA,ments for superannuation liabUity. Post Office,71
NA,payments for superannuation Uability increased,71
NA,"from $49m in 1972-73 to $104m in 1973-74, and",71
NA,provision for the payment of $130m has been,71
NA,made in the Post Office budget this year to meet,71
NA,the cost of this item.,71
NA,"The present Opposition, when in Government,",71
NA,refused to initiate steps to place the Austrahan,71
NA,Post Office on a proper businesslike footing. It,71
NA,took a change in government to see the establish-,71
NA,ment of a commission of inquiry. (Quorum for-,71
NA,med). I thank the honourable member for Wan-,71
NA,non ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) for calhng some,71
NA,Country Party members to the House. It is,71
NA,interesting to note that it took a Liberal member,71
NA,of the Opposition to call the quorum. Obviously,71
NA,he wanted some Country Party members present,71
NA,to particpate in the debate. I ought to remind the,71
NA,House that when post and telegraph rates were,71
NA,altered in 1973 the Country Party endorsed the,71
NA,increase in telephone rates. It was only interested,71
NA,in objecting to increased postal rates on country,72
NA,newspapers. It is not really concerned about,72
NA,"increases in telephone rates. As I was saying, the",72
NA,"present Opposition, when in government,",72
NA,refused to take the steps necessary to put the,72
NA,Austrahan Post Office on a proper businesslike,72
NA,footing. It was the present Government which,72
NA,after the election of 1972 estabhshed the com-,72
NA,mission of inquiry into the operations of the Post,72
NA,Office.,72
NA,The point that has been largely overlooked in,72
NA,relation to the new rates is that the introduction,72
NA,of a standard postal article is a very worthwhile,72
NA,step forward in the handling of mail. The stan-,72
NA,"dard postal article in many instances, as it covers",72
NA,"most sized letters, will result in a saving of postal",72
NA,charges. A standard postal article will be be any,72
NA,item of mail between the dimensions of 90 milli-,72
NA,metres by 140 millimetres and 120 millimetres,72
NA,by 235 rnilhmetres. As there is not any weight,72
NA,"limit, no doubt this will result in a substantial",72
NA,saving in postal charges.,72
NA,"The other matter that has been mentioned, the",72
NA,"increase in pubhc telephone charges, is again a",72
NA,course that was prescribed by the Opposition,72
NA,when in government. When the telephone equip-,72
NA,ment was installed in 1963 provision was made,72
NA,for 5c steps only. Because of the mechanism of,72
NA,"the telephones, the only step up that can be made",72
NA,from a 5c charge is an increase to 10c. This ought,72
NA,to be brought to the notice of the people of,72
NA,Austraha. The increase in domestic telephone,72
NA,rentals from $55 to $65 is an increase of $10 as,72
NA,compared with an increase of $30 for commer-,72
NA,cial rentals. I trunk it is proper that business telesaid:,72
NA,phone rentals be higher than domestic telephone,72
NA,rentals. After all the charge for business tele-,72
NA,phone rentals is a deductible item for taxation,72
NA,purposes because it is an expense item in the,72
NA,profit and loss account ofthe business. I think it is,72
NA,proper that the householder be not called upon,72
NA,to subsidise business telephone rentals.,72
NA,I make one final point in referring to the,72
NA,that increased telephone costs and increased,72
NA,telephone charges will have on the average,72
NA,householder. It has been completely and concannot,72
NA,veniently overlooked by members of the OppoMinister,72
NA,sition in this debate that the aboUtion of radio,72
NA,and television receiver hcence fees represents,72
NA,saving to almost every member of the compartments,72
NA,munity of $26.50 a year. If one were to deduct,72
NA,from that the $ 10 per annum increase in the,72
NA,phone rental one would be stiil left with a saving,72
NA,of $ 16.50.1 doubt that even members ofthe,72
NA,tralian Country Party would be writing more,72
NA,"than 550 letters a year, which would be the",72
NA,number that would be required to take up the,72
NA,"saving that would result. So, even i f the",72
NA,"difference is only $16.50, the non-payment to the",72
NA,Post Office of a television and radio receiver's li-,72
NA,cence wiU more than offset the increased postal,72
NA,charges.,72
NA,"The point of aU the opposition from, in par-",72
NA,"ticular, the Country Party to increased postal",72
NA,charges relates not to domestic maUs but to the,72
NA,charge imposed on the carriage of country,72
NA,newspapers. Anybody listening to this debate a,72
NA,Uttle earUer would have heard a number of com-,72
NA,ments made on this matter. It would be a very,72
NA,interesting exercise to conduct an inquiry into the,72
NA,ownership of country newspapers and the coun-,72
NA,try media to see who benefits most directly from,72
NA,the loss suffered by the taxpayer on the carriage,72
NA,of country newspapers by post. That is the matter,72
NA,of real interest. I for one believe that if,72
NA,newspapers are a commercial operation they,72
NA,ought to be carried at a commercial charge. I f,72
NA,they are a business they ought to make their,72
NA,proper contribution towards the cost of provid-,72
NA,"ing a service, just as a householder has to do.",72
Mr KING ,Wimmera) (4.36)-I would like to,72
NA,make a few comments in relation to the measure,72
NA,before the House. I would like to commence my,72
NA,remarks by referring to that paragraph of his sec-,72
NA,ond reading speech in which the Special Minister,72
NA,of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen) made reference to,72
NA,the fact that as far back as the Premiers Confer-,72
NA,ence of 7 June it was known pubhcly that the,72
NA,Post Office's appropriation in the Budget would,72
NA,be held at last year's level of $385m. That is the,72
NA,first point he made. A litde later on the Mimster,72
NA,"After close study, the Government has also decided that it",72
NA,would not be appropriate to cut Post Office capital invest-,72
NA,ment by some further $30m and let existing telephone appli-,72
NA,"cants increase by 40,000 to 163,000. That would mean a tele-",72
NA,communicauons engineering construction program 6 per,72
NA,cent below the 1973-74 level of effort.,72
NA,Why did the Minister want to refer to the cut of,72
NA,$30m and then decide that he was not going to,72
NA,effect make a cut? That reminds me of the husband,72
NA,who was praised because he gave up belting his,72
NA,wife. There is no need to mention such a thing. I,72
NA,understand what it all means and why the,72
NA,has referred to it. As for keeping the ap-,72
NA,"propriation at the same level as last year, I chal-",72
NA,a lenge the Minister to indicate with what other de-,72
NA,the appropriation has remained at the,72
NA,same low level as the previous year. I do not,72
NA,teleknow of any. Although I have not studied the,72
NA,position I would venture to say that there would,72
NA,"Ausbe very few, if any. It would appear that the",72
NA,Special Minister of State has been successful in,72
NA,his original goal to make every section of the,72
NA,Postmaster-General's Department pay its way. I,72
NA,do not agree with the remarks of the honourable,73
NA,member for Shortland ( Mr Morris) in this,73
NA,respect. There are certain sectors of the,73
NA,Postmaster-General's Department that must of,73
NA,necessity automatically be a cost against the rest,73
NA,"of the Department, or if you like, the taxpayers.",73
NA,"Basically this BiU, Uke many others, is a slug",73
NA,against users of the telephone and postal ser-,73
NA,vices. There is no disputing that. It seeks to,73
NA,increase considerably many charges. I cannot,73
NA,accept the statement by the Special Minister of,73
NA,State that if the Senate had passed the original,73
NA,measure some two or three months ago it would,73
NA,not have been necessary to impose further,73
NA,increases. It seems strange that because the Sen-,73
NA,ate did not accept the proposed increases of a,73
NA,few months ago the cost of telephone connec-,73
NA,tions should go up automaticaUy by 25 per cent.,73
NA,The same thing appUes as far as telephone ren-,73
NA,tals are concerned.,73
NA,"As I said a moment ago, this BUl is a slug",73
NA,against aU telephone and postal users. Sinular,73
NA,legislation was blocked in the Senate on a,73
NA,vious occasion. There are many people outside,73
NA,this Parliament who would Uke to see it blocked,73
NA,"again, but, being a Budget measure, that cannot",73
NA,be done. Is it possible that the Prime Minister,73
NA,( Mr Whitlam) or someone else in the Governsame,73
NA,ment wants to get the Government into a posment,73
NA,ition where it can go to the people again by forcbe,73
NA,ing another double dissolution? Is that one of,73
NA,reasons why the Special Minister of State has,73
NA,forward this proposition at this stage?,73
NA,Let us have a look at the proposed increases.,73
NA,The postage rate for an ordinary letter is to be,73
NA,increased from 7c to 10c. That is going to be,73
NA,terrific slug on those people who use the postal,73
NA,service considerably. The cost of telephone,73
NA,is to rise from 4.75c to 6c. That is a pretty high,73
NA,"percentage rise, I can appreciate the practical",73
NA,side of increasing pubhc telephone charges,73
NA,"insofar as the use of coins are concerned, but",73
NA,a pretty severe slug to increase the charge from,73
NA,5c to 10c. That wUl be done over a period,73
NA,"time, depending on the rate of conversion.",73
NA,Let us have a look at the telephone rental,73
NA,ation. The rental charged for an ordinary private,73
NA,telephone is to be increased from $55 to $65 and,73
NA,for a business telephone from $55 to $85. One,73
NA,automaticaUy includes in the business sector the,73
NA,"primary producer, unless he can declare that",73
NA,"telephone is used predominantly for social caUs,",73
NA,that he does not wish to have his name included,73
NA,in a telephone directory as a primary producer,73
NA,"but as Mr Joe Blow, and that he does not make",73
NA,claim in respect of his telephone as far as any tax-,73
NA,ation deductions are concerned. All I can say to,73
NA,the primary producers on this point is that they,73
NA,ought to have a very close look at their financial,73
NA,situation. It may be advantageous to them to de-,73
NA,clare themselves in such a way. I have spoken to,73
NA,lots of primary producers about making claims,73
NA,for telephone expenses for taxation purposes and,73
NA,I have been told by many of them that the oppor-,73
NA,tunity to make such claims does not mean a great,73
NA,"deal to them because they are not paying any tax,",73
NA,"thanks to the present Government, as they have",73
NA,not been able to show a profit although they,73
NA,have shown profits in previous years.,73
NA,When one looks at some of the new charges,73
NA,one will find that a substantial increase is in-,73
NA,volved in many cases. If one compares the exist-,73
NA,ing rates with the new rates one wUl find any,73
NA,amount of instances where the increase involved,73
NA,is 50 per cent and in some cases 100 per cent. In,73
NA,certain instances it is 300 per cent. A comparison,73
NA,of some of the present charges with the charges,73
NA,imposed a few years ago by the Liberal-Country,73
NA,preParty Government wUl reveal that many of the,73
NA,people who wUl now have to pay a telephone,73
NA,"rental of $85 were paying in the vicinity of, I",73
NA,"think, only $27 at thattime.That is a substantial",73
NA,increase. All of these things are happening at the,73
NA,time as the Postmaster-General's Depart-,73
NA,has been reducing services. I do not want to,73
NA,personal insofar as individuals in the Depart-,73
NA,"the ment are concerned. I beheve, as I have said in",73
NA,"put this chamber before, that there are many very",73
NA,loyal and sincere members of the Postmaster-,73
NA,General's Department who are prepared to do,73
NA,everything that they are asked to do and do it,73
NA,very efficiently. It is because of the overall pohcy,73
NA,a of the Government that they are directed to fol-,73
NA,low that they cannot provide the services they,73
NA,caUs used to be able to provide.,73
NA,The Postmaster-General's Department has,73
NA,it is become so removed from being a service depart-,73
NA,ment that it is almost a second taxation depart-,73
NA,of ment. That is what it appears to be to many,73
NA,people. The service formerly provided has been,73
NA,"whittled away, slowly but surely. I recaU what",73
NA,situhappened not so very long ago when the first,73
NA,move was made against Saturday morning oper-,73
NA,ations. The 3 hours trading that we used to have,73
NA,of a Saturday morning was reduced to one hour.,73
NA,That one hour was vital and important because it,73
NA,the gave the personnel an opportunity in many,73
NA,instances to sort maUs and to send them on their,73
NA,way. There are any number of Ulustrations which,73
NA,I can give today of maU being posted as late as,73
NA,a Thursday of one week which is not dehvered,73
NA,until Tuesday of the next week witlun the same,74
NA,State.,74
NA,"I am referring now to Victoria, which is not a",74
NA,very big State. It should not take very long for a,74
NA,letter to get from one side of it to the other.,74
NA,can give illustrations today if required of mail,74
NA,being posted on a Thursday afternoon and not,74
NA,dehvered before Monday and in some isolated,74
NA,cases Tuesday of the following week. Yet the,74
NA,honourable member for Shortland ( Mr Morris),74
NA,criticised the country people for demanding an,74
NA,adequate postal service. I wonder how many of,74
NA,his constituents would demand something better,74
NA,if they had mails posted on Thursdays and not,74
NA,dehvered to their destination until Tuesday of,74
NA,the next week. This is a very poor situation as I,74
NA,see it.,74
NA,What else has happened? I turn to telephone,74
NA,connections. I regret to have to say that in,74
NA,instances there have been extended,74
NA,think of the country automatic telephone,74
NA,"exchanges which, as I said, almost came to a",74
NA,"standstill. That is not quite right, but it appears",74
NA,that in my area they have slowed down. At the,74
NA,same time the costs for upgrading purposes to,74
NA,many of the subscribers has been substantial.,74
NA,"think my colleague, the honourable member for",74
NA,Mallee ( Mr Fisher) or the honourable member,74
NA,for Darling Downs ( Mr MCVeigh)-i t was probcountry,74
NA,ably both of them-hav e referred in this House,74
NA,the individual cost of installing a telephone,74
NA,some rural areas.,74
NA,Mr MCVeigh-I t is far too high.,74
Mr KING,O f course it is. It runs into not only,74
NA,a few dollars or a few hundred doUars but in,74
NA,some cases thousands of doUars. The honourable,74
NA,member for Shortland was laughing a httle whUe,74
NA,ago while the previous Postmaster-General the,74
NA,referred to the issue and said,74
NA,would be cheaper to buy the farms than to install,74
NA,telephones on them. What a ridiculous situation.,74
NA,Mr MCVeigh-H e seems to hke his steak for,74
NA,breakfast offthe farm.,74
Mr KING,"Tha t may be so too, but he certheir",74
NA,tainly does not have much sympathy for people,74
NA,outside the metropolitan areas. I very reluctantly,74
NA,have to support this BUl. I know that it wiU,74
NA,a substantial effect on many people throughout,74
NA,the length and breadth of this country. I think it,74
NA,was the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr,74
NA,Nixon) who referred to these increased costs,74
NA,being inflationary. The honourable member for,74
NA,Corio ( Mr Scholes) tried to pooh-pooh the idea.,74
NA,Anyone who has any business sense at all,74
NA,that if costs such as telephone charges are,74
NA,increased this must of necessity be an extra cost,74
NA,which in turn must be inflationary.,74
NA,The position is the same with the whole Bud-,74
NA,get. I know that I am not aUowed to speak about,74
NA,"But I the Budget, but the whole Budget, in my mind,",74
NA,"because of its increased expenditure, wUl be a",74
NA,very big factor that wUl contribute to inflation. If,74
NA,Government expenditure goes up by 32 per cent,74
NA,surely that is heading in the direction of a 32 per,74
NA,cent increase in inflation.,74
NA,I say again that I reluctantly support these BiUs,74
NA,knowing that because they are Budget measures,74
NA,I have no alternative. I know that they wUl be a,74
NA,teriffic slug on many country people as are the,74
NA,previous increases introduced by this Govern-,74
NA,ment. I think they are unjust. Despite what the,74
NA,"Vernon report might say, it has given little con-",74
NA,sideration to the aU-important issues of inflation,74
NA,many and decentraUsation. They would be the two,74
NA,delays. I vital considerations.,74
Mr LUSHER ,Hume) (4.49)-There are a,74
NA,few things which are important to people who do,74
NA,not Uve in metropoUtan areas. There are a few,74
NA,things which are very important to those people,74
NA,"I who Uve in the country. The telephone, the maU",74
NA,and the roads are 3 things which are of particular,74
NA,concern. There is currendy a situation in the,74
NA,where all these 3 services are at the worst,74
NA,to possible level in Uving memory. The Govern-,74
NA,in ment is introducing the most savage percentage,74
NA,increases in the cost of telephone and maU ser-,74
NA,vices in Uving memory. I do not think that people,74
NA,would mind so much about paying a bit more if,74
NA,they felt they were getting some service. But,74
NA,"what is happening in the country areas, particu-",74
NA,"larly in New South Wales, is that services are",74
NA,being withdrawn. We have already seen,74
NA,Saturday maU services go. There is no chance in,74
NA,world that these services on Saturdays wUl be,74
NA,that in some cases it restored.,74
NA,Cootamundra and Young-majo r country,74
NA,"centres with 7,000 and 8,000 people-ar e receiv-",74
NA,ing maU from the capital cities twice a week. This,74
NA,is an intolerable situation not only for people in,74
NA,personal hves but also for businesses and,74
NA,for people who are trying to give some sort of,74
NA,service to the community. A lot of these reduc-,74
NA,have tions in the maU service in country areas have,74
NA,been put down to the problems with the raU-,74
NA,"ways, the fact that we have union difficulties, that",74
NA,fuel shortages exist and that we have to cut down,74
NA,on the raU services and therefore the postal ser-,74
NA,vices. TravelUng post offices have been taken off,74
NA,trains. I understand that the New South Wales,74
NA,can see raUways department had been unhappy for,74
NA,some period oftimeabout the return that it was,74
NA,receiving from letting the Postal Department use,75
NA,the travelling post offices. But this is perhaps,75
NA,another area. The fact is that because travelling,75
NA,post offices are being taken off trains and because,75
NA,"trains themselves are not running, country",75
NA,people are being done again. They are losing ser-,75
NA,vices and now they are being asked to pay more,75
NA,for that reduction in service.,75
NA,A situation seems to be developing where the,75
NA,Postal Department is taking advantage of the,75
NA,New South Wales Public Transport Comweekend.,75
NA,mission's difficulties in getting the trains running.,75
NA,It seems as though in the same way as the ties,75
NA,"Saturday morning mail service was discontinued,",75
NA,these cuts in rail services are being taken advanthis.,75
NA,tage of to reduce other services to the country.,75
NA,repeat that there is no satisfactory service from,75
NA,the capital cities. This problem cannot all be laid,75
NA,at the feet of the New South Wales railways. I,75
NA,support the railways. I tliink that the service,75
NA,should be looked at and that there are ways,75
NA,means by which it should be improved. I know,75
NA,that the Commonwealth is looking at the situcause,75
NA,ation and is seeking involvement in the railway,75
NA,services. We have towns where the railway is,75
NA,sponsible for the basic employment. It must be,75
NA,ensured that this service is improved and that,75
NA,get a continuation of and an increase of passenneed,75
NA,ger and freight services in country areas where,75
NA,the services can be run on a sound economic car,75
NA,basis.,75
NA,But the Postal Department has to accept the,75
NA,responsibihty for getting the mail through. If,75
NA,"railways cannot carry it on a satisfactory basis,",75
NA,then until the services can be restored the,75
NA,Department and the Postmaster-General (Senacost,75
NA,tor Bishop) surely have a responsibility to seek,75
NA,other avenues to see that the mail is distributed cent.,75
NA,through the country areas. Why have they not,75
NA,investigated the possibUity of using trucks to,75
NA,carry the maU into the country by road? I beheve,75
NA,that the unions will not tolerate private,75
NA,enterprise being employed to do this. I beUeve,75
NA,that if the maU is to go by road it has to go,75
NA,PMG trucks. But people in the country do,75
NA,care what sort of trucks it goes on. We do not improving,75
NA,care if it goes on horseback as long as it gets,75
NA,through. At this stage the maU is not getting,75
NA,through and we are being asked to pay an,75
NA,increase of from 7c to 10c for a service which is,75
NA,getting worse week by week. People wUl not them,75
NA,accept it. There is a savage enough feeling,75
NA,ing up in the country areas now without adding,75
NA,to it and without fuelling the fires with actions,75
NA,hke this. People are concerned. There is a ground,75
NA,swell of feeUng buUding up. The Government,75
NA,knows about it and yet imposts Uke this are,75
NA,savagely hung around the necks of country,75
NA,people.,75
NA,The town of Cootamundra has a population,75
NA,"including women and chUdren of about 6,500",75
NA,people. On Friday night 2 weeks ago it was de-,75
NA,cided to send around a petition to see what could,75
NA,be done about the rail and postal services. By,75
NA,"Sunday evening 2,000 people had signed that",75
NA,"petition-2,00 0 people out of a total population",75
NA,"of 6,500 had signed the petition in 2 days over a",75
NA,This indicates the type of concern that,75
NA,exists in country areas and in smaller communi-,75
NA,over the raw deal that is being dished out by,75
NA,government. We have to do something about,75
NA,The Government has a responsibihty to see,75
NA,I that people get their basic and essential services.,75
NA,We also have to look at the effect that this situ-,75
NA,ation is having on decentraUsation-suc h decen-,75
NA,traUsation as exists. The increase in postal rates,75
NA,and will do nothing to encourage people or,75
NA,businesses to estabUsh and in some cases it will,75
NA,businesses to close down. People who live,75
NA,in the cities and who do not venture out into,75
NA,recountry areas do not have any understanding of,75
NA,the costs that are incurred in trying to get simple,75
NA,we things Uke spare parts out to the people who,75
NA,them in the bush. A person in business in,75
NA,the country who needs a spare part for a motor,75
NA,"or a truck has to make three, four orfivetele-",75
NA,phone calls to Sydney or Melbourne. That is a,75
NA,ridiculous state of affairs. Each one of the tele-,75
NA,"phone calls costs $2, $3 or $4. A person in Syd-",75
NA,the ney who requires a spare part can ring up for 5 c,75
NA,or 7c but it costs doUars to make an equivalent,75
NA,"Postal phone call from Young, Cowra or Tumut. That",75
NA,is bringing country businesses to their knees.,75
NA,That cost is now to be increased by up to 50 per,75
NA,We cannot accept a situation Uke this; it is,75
NA,completely,75
NA,and the Governmentintolerable. The Postal Department,75
NA,must be seen to be trying to,75
NA,do something about it. I know that the Govern-,75
NA,on ment has problems. But no effort seems to be,75
NA,not made. Suggestions are put up about ways of,75
NA,the services. But the Government,75
NA,does not seem to be interested in considering,75
NA,those suggestions. When is something concrete,75
NA,going to be done? When are we going to get a,75
NA,better deal for country people without just asking,75
NA,to pay more and more through the nose,75
NA,buUdand to get less and less for it.,75
NA,A chap from Boorowa wrote to me and,75
NA,pointed out that the railways and the Postal De-,75
NA,partment had frigged up the mail in that town to,75
NA,such an extent that it comes in about once every,75
NA,being 10 days. I do not understand and he does not,75
NA,understand why it is that the mail cannot be,76
NA,on to a train that will go into a stauon where,76
NA,can be dehvered to the area. Why is there so inflation.,76
NA,much inflexibihty? Why does the Postal DepartWe,76
NA,ment have to keep sending the mail out the same,76
NA,way when the Department realises that it has,76
NA,be off-loaded and sent back when a train runs?,76
NA,Why cannot they re-route the mail?,76
NA,No one seems to be aware of the human and,76
NA,economic problems that are being raised by the,76
NA,savage imposts. There are problems for people,76
NA,who hve on the fringes of telephone districts. For,76
NA,them a call two or three miles up the road is,76
NA,trunk call. It seems that considerauon is not,76
NA,being given to rationalising the areas within,76
NA,which one can make a call for the basic charge. lege.,76
NA,The people who hve on the fringes of these dis-,76
NA,trict like everyone else are issued with a tele-,76
NA,phone book. The people who Uve in metropoUthese,76
NA,tan areas are issued with a telephone book which,76
NA,covers all of the telephone numbers wbich they,76
NA,are Ukely to ring in the next 5 years. But the teleit.,76
NA,phone book issued to people in fringe areas is,76
NA,adequate in many cases and it could cut out,76
NA,about 5 nules up the road. These people are,76
NA,entided to be issued with the telephone directory,76
NA,for the adjoining area which may be as close as,76
NA,couple of miles away. If a person wants the teleto,76
NA,phone book for another district he must go,76
NA,and buy it. I do not understand why the Governwho,76
NA,ment cannot give consideration to these people people.,76
NA,who have a genuine problem. Many of them,76
NA,have services which are being reduced or are,76
NA,being cut out. But the people in these httle,76
NA,wUl not receive any assistance from the Governproposed,76
NA,"ment, assistance which would not cost the effort",76
NA,Government very much at all.,76
NA,We have to bring about a reaUsation of the,76
NA,problems which these people face. We have,76
NA,bring the Government to an understanding of,76
NA,the Utde people who have to work and slave,76
NA,country areas. We have to make government,76
NA,aware of the problems. I know that this Governwant,76
NA,ment has not been in office for very long,76
NA,perhaps the situations have not changed much,76
NA,from the time when those on this side of the,76
NA,House were on the other side. But the Governwant,76
NA,ment has to take into account the genuine future,76
NA,interests of these people. At least we made,76
NA,effort to take things into consideration. We,76
NA,now faced with a Government which is aUowing,76
NA,"industrial unrest to run riot, inflation to accelerlems",76
NA,"ate to record levels, and every conceivable econregret",76
NA,"omic dislocation to occur, with the consequent",76
NA,increases in costs for basic services wbich should,76
NA,be avaUable and for the retraction of services,76
NA,country areas. We cannot just accept the fact,76
NA,put innation is causing these problems because we,76
NA,it have to get back to the underlying causes of that,76
NA,cannot just sit back and say that this is,76
NA,"happening, therefore that has to happen, be-",76
NA,to cause it is not good enough and the people wiU,76
NA,not accept it. Unless the Government wants to,76
NA,aggravate a situation in which people wUl pick,76
NA,up their scythes and pitchforks and march on cit-,76
NA,"ies, it has to be prepared to think more seriously",76
NA,about the problems that these people face. Right,76
NA,at the guts of the problem are the posts and tele-,76
NA,"a graphs, raU, roads and the rest of the essential",76
NA,services which everybody ought to be entitled to,76
NA,as a matter of right and not as a matter of privi-,76
NA,I urge the Government to give consideration to,76
NA,matters and to these people. The Govern-,76
NA,ment is running the country in such a shpshod,76
NA,and mishandled fashion that everyone is feeling,76
NA,People out in the country feel it twice as badly.,76
NA,not If commodities are short they are twice as short,76
NA,in the bush. We have to see that country people,76
NA,not get a reasonable go. No one wants to see them,76
NA,get any more than that. They do not expect to get,76
NA,a more than that. They elect their representatives,76
NA,this place in the same way as do city people. It,76
NA,out is those representatives who come down here,76
NA,wUl continue to call for a fair deal for those,76
NA,I want to conclude on that note. The Govern-,76
NA,ment ought to see that a department like the,76
NA,areas Postmaster-General's Department or the,76
NA,corporation is seen to be making that,76
NA,because if it is not seen to be making that,76
NA,effort the Government wUl continue to generate,76
NA,justifiable unrest and disquiet in country areas,76
NA,"and no one, particularly country people, want to",76
NA,to see that sort of situation exacerbated.,76
Mr GRAHAM ,North Sydney) (5.4)- I wUl,76
NA,"not speak at length on this matter. However, I",76
NA,to make a few comments in support of what,76
NA,and was said by my friend the honourable member,76
NA,for Hume ( Mr Lusher) about the significance of,76
NA,postal services for people in our community. I,76
NA,to add to that some comments about the,76
NA,"position, as I see it, which is beginning to",76
NA,an emerge. I would be indeed happy if I were able,76
NA,"are to encourage my young friend, the honourable",76
NA,"member for Hume, to beUeve that these prob-",76
NA,wUl be solved in the very near future. I,76
NA,"to say, however, that I am certain that they",76
NA,wUl not be solved. The inflation rate in Australia,76
NA,is likely to reach 20 per cent by Christmas and,76
NA,in this wUl have its impact upon the program of,76
NA,that development witlun the Postmaster-General's,76
NA,Department in a very serious way during the,77
NA,next 9 months of this financial year. We will then,77
NA,face the situation where the programs for 1975,77
NA,and 1976 to be announced in the 1975 Budget,77
NA,will require enormous increases for the,77
NA,Postmaster-General's Department.,77
NA,Whilst we are aware of the fact that the trade,77
NA,union control within the Department is very pro-,77
NA,"found and very significant, whilst we are aware",77
NA,of the fact that that great Department is absol-,77
NA,utely vital to the economy and to the welfare of,77
NA,"the Austrahan nation, and whilst we are absol-",77
NA,utely sure that we know that this great Depart-,77
NA,"ment can be strangled by industrial action, we",77
NA,must admit that over these next 9 months the,77
NA,most likely scene in Austraha will be that of,77
NA,further disruption and further effects of the,77
NA,tionary process upon the Postmaster-General's,77
NA,Department. I think that this is extremely sig-,77
NA,nificant and will affect the plans by the State,77
NA,governments for decentralisation. People are not,77
NA,going to move to country areas with businesses if,77
NA,their costs are going to be correspondingly,77
NA,increased. A quite considerable amount of infor-,77
NA,mation revealed by various committees shows,77
NA,that the customers themselves were more,77
NA,anxious about their services than they were in,77
NA,particular about the cost of them. It is not only,77
NA,the cost of outgoing calls but the cost of incon-,77
NA,venience to metropolitan based associates need-,77
NA,ing to effect trunk line calls which in many cases,77
NA,results in a loss of business. As honourable,77
NA,"members will appreciate, this is an operational",77
NA,problem for companies which would seek to,77
NA,move out ofthe great metropolises to some of the,77
NA,expansion areas that have been defined by the,77
NA,State governments and by the Commonwealth,77
NA,Government. This is an enormous problem for us,77
NA,and I feel that this Department will reflect the,77
NA,problem in the way I have indicated.,77
NA,"At this moment, as honourable members",77
NA,"know, there is an added burden throughout the",77
NA,"world of something like $20,000m to $26,000m",77
NA,"which has been put on account with the indusPostmaster-General,",77
NA,trial Western nations. The effect of this will,77
NA,"faced in Austraha, not only as a result of the",77
NA,internal inflationary processes resulting from,77
NA,wage increases but also because of this problem,77
NA,that arises on the international scene. We must,77
NA,understand also that at present our balance of,77
NA,"payments, our overseas funds, are dimimshing at",77
NA,something of the order of $ 16m per week and,77
NA,that by thetimethe Budget of 1975 comes along,77
NA,we wul be in a situation in which I doubt very,77
NA,much that one will be able to encourage the,77
NA,honourable member for Hume to believe that,77
NA,there will be a substantial improvement in this,77
NA,service.,77
NA,Finally I should like to make an appeal to the,77
NA,Minister and ask him whether he can do some-,77
NA,thing about second class mail. If he will be kind,77
NA,enough to have a word to the Postmaster-,77
NA,General it might be possible for him to have,77
NA,some improvements effected in the rates of deUv-,77
NA,ery in the North Sydney area and through the,77
NA,Artarmon MaU Exchange.,77
Mr DONALD CAMERON ,Griffith ),77
NA,(5.10)- I regard these across the board increases,77
NA,in many of the areas of postal charges as being,77
NA,an exercise of deceit by the Government.,77
NA,Government members have stated today that the,77
NA,charge for posting an ordinary letter has not,77
NA,inflabeen altered for some time. Yet last year the,77
NA,Government reduced the weight of letters which,77
NA,could be posted at standard rate by some 25 per,77
NA,cent. The weight was reduced from 28 grams to,77
NA,20 grams. So the public was hit hard there. The,77
NA,Government also introduced a system under,77
NA,"which, if a letter weighed more than 20 grams, it",77
NA,would cost 15c to post. So the public was belted,77
NA,"there. A few short weeks ago, the Government",77
NA,attempted to introduce an increased charge of 9c,77
NA,"for a standard rate letter. Previously, the ""charge",77
NA,"had been 7c for such a letter. The Senate, rightly",77
NA,or wrongly- I am not coming into that argu-,77
NA,ment-rejecte d the increase. It was a move that,77
NA,pleased me. I post many letters. I thought that in,77
NA,these rather difficult days at least that was one,77
NA,small saving. But the Postmaster-General (Sena-,77
NA,tor Bishop) has used the Budget to increase the,77
NA,postage cost for a standard rate letter to 10c.,77
NA,The honourable member for Corio ( Mr,77
NA,"Scholes), who is not present in the House,",77
NA,expressed the view today that members of the,77
NA,Parliament speak in relation to unpopular,77
NA,measures according to the side of the ParUament,77
NA,"on which they sit. I reject that. I can recall that, a",77
NA,few short years back when I occupied a seat on,77
NA,the side of the Parliament now occupied by the,77
NA,"present Government, Sir Alan Hulme, the then",77
NA,increased the postage rate,77
NA,be for a standard rate letter from 5c to 7c. At that,77
NA,"time, I made the plea that there was a need for a",77
NA,giant investigation into the Australian Post Office,77
NA,"and I said that the government ofthe day, which",77
NA,"was composed of my Party, could no longer look",77
NA,forward or take for granted my support when ini-,77
NA,tiating such large increases. Yet today there has,77
NA,been an increase of nearly 50 per cent in the cost,77
NA,"of posting a lousy letter. Mr Deputy Speaker, I",77
NA,say to you and to the Special Minister of State,77
NA,( Mr Lionel Bowen) who is at the table that it is,77
NA,no use to the people of Australia for different,77
NA,"governments, regardless of their poUtical colour,",78
NA,to continue along the road ofjust increasing,78
NA,tal charges.,78
NA,I am quite certain that a comparison of postal,78
NA,costs in this country with those in other countries,78
NA,"shows us up in a bad Ught. In fact, it costs",78
NA,14c Australian to send a half ounce letter from,78
NA,the Umted States of America to AustraUa. But,78
NA,the same letter is posted from Austraha to the,78
NA,United States in one of the post boxes of the,78
NA,"present Postmaster-General, a person wUl pay",78
NA,35c for the equivalent service. That difference,78
NA,cannot be explained away simply by saying that,78
NA,there is a greater volume of maU in the United,78
NA,States. That is not good enough. It is ume that,78
NA,came to grips with our entire system and gave it,78
NA,"good shake, if necessary. It is no use saying",78
NA,"we wiU upset some people in the Post Office, let",78
NA,us forget about it for that reason; don't push,78
NA,under the carpet and slug the public once again.,78
NA,The pubhc cannot continue to carry the imposiGovernment,78
NA,tions which are being thrust upon it by the,78
NA,present Government. I know that,78
NA,will say that the Post Office wiU lose so many,78
NA,mUUons of doUars this year. He wiU ask me,78
NA,whether I am suggesting that the Government,78
NA,should not spend money in some emotive area to,78
NA,make up for the losses in the Post Office. He,78
NA,talk about child care or paralysed people and,78
NA,ask: 'Are you suggesting that we do not spend,78
NA,money in that area?' But if one looks at what is,78
NA,being ripped out of the AustraUan taxpayers',78
NA,pockets in the form of taxation compared with,78
NA,the amount the Government has derived from,78
NA,"that source over other years, one can see that the",78
NA,Government has more than enough money to order,78
NA,withstand some temporary losses until such time,78
NA,as the recommendations contained in the report,78
NA,of the expensive Commission,78
NA,investigate the affairs of the Post Office are,78
NA,implemented.,78
NA,I was elected to this ParUament in 1966,78
NA,took my seat in 1967. In the financial year,78
NA,"1966-67, the amount paid in income tax by Austhat",78
NA,"tralians was less than $2,000m. In a few short",78
NA,"years that amount has increased to $8,000m.",78
NA,we take income tax as a percentage of Budget,78
NA,"oudays, we find that when I entered this ParUathe",78
NA,ment income tax was 32.4 per cent of total,78
NA,get oudays. It has now risen to 48 per cent. Just,78
NA,how much more can each Australian-pen - supply.,78
NA,"sioners, workers and others-b e expected to pay?",78
NA,This Government is slowly strangling the initia-,78
NA,tive of every working Austrahan.,78
NA,"he or she turns, he or she has to meet",78
NA,some Government scheme or service which is,78
NA,inefficient. I believe that the Austrahan Post,78
NA,posOffice is a most inefficient organisation.,78
NA,"In this cognate debate, together with increases",78
NA,"in postal charges, we are considering legislation",78
NA,to authorise the introduction by the Government,78
NA,of a courier service. This proposal should not,78
NA,only simply be welcomed with open arms. The,78
NA,Government says: 'This is being done privately.,78
NA,if We are now going to do it too'. The reason that,78
NA,private courier services have developed over the,78
NA,years is that they provide a more efficient ap-,78
NA,proach to the job of delivering maU. The Special,78
NA,Minister of State may say that they only service,78
NA,needs in cities and that the Australian Post Office,78
NA,"has, for example, to carry letters from Perth to",78
NA,we InnisfaU in North Queensland and that such ser-,78
NA,a vices cost more. The fact is that these small cour-,78
NA,that ier services have met a need and are more,78
NA,efficient and far less costly. What is this Govern-,78
NA,it ment to do about them? It is to set up a sinular,78
NA,organisauon. I ask the Minister whether the,78
NA,has in mind for the future a scheme,78
NA,to forbid private enterprise entering or continu-,78
NA,the Minister ing in this area?,78
NA,We have seen the way in which the Minister,78
NA,for Social Security ( Mr Hayden) has set out sys-,78
NA,tematically to destroy nursing homes. In the next,78
NA,wUl two or three weeks in my home city of Brisbane,78
NA,"2,000 people are Ukely to be affected because 23",78
NA,nursing homes in Brisbane wUl be forced to close,78
NA,unless there is an increase in the subsidy paid to,78
NA,maintain people in those homes. Just as this,78
NA,"socialist Government is causing that situation, is",78
NA,it looking at the introduction of legislation to,78
NA,force private courier services out of business in,78
NA,to give the Government a monopoly in this,78
NA,"area? Once a monopoly is established, we are on",78
NA,the road once again to a most inefficient,78
NA,that was set up to organisation.,78
NA,I have promised the Leader of the House ( Mr,78
NA,Daly) that I wUl not take too muchtimeof the,78
NA,Parhament in this debate today. But I do hope,78
NA,"and that notwithstanding its poUtical colour, the",78
NA,Government wiU have the courage to recognise,78
NA,a great deal has to be done with respect to,78
NA,the Austrahan Post Office. The stage has been,78
NA,"If reached, in a few short years, where a 5c stamp",78
NA,has almost become a coUectors' item. The way,78
NA,"Government is going, in allowing inflation to",78

NA,"again in a few short years, they wUl be in short",78
NA,Mr Keogh-Ar e you not going to send me a,78
NA,Whichever way Christmas card this year?,78
Mr DONALD CAMERON,The honourable,78
NA,member for Bowman asks whether I am going to,78
NA,send any Christmas cards this year. The answer,79
NA,"is yes. But, regrettably, his name will have to",79
NA,come off my hst as I must effect some saving,79
NA,somewhere. I conclude with a very strong plea to,79
NA,the Special Minister of State that he does not,79
NA,continue to adopt the system of introducing,79
NA,further increases in charges simply to get the,79
NA,Government out of trouble.,79
Mr WENTWORTH ,MACKellar) ataU.,79
NA,"(5.20)-This Bill is, of course, part of the cost of",79
NA,the Labor Government. It is said that the country,79
NA,has to meet the costs of the Labor Government. I at Mr,79
NA,do not think that when the Austrahan people explanation,79
NA,elected the Labor Party to government they speech.,79
NA,realised howfiercethose costs were going to be.,79
NA,It is said that because of this increase,79
NA,of running the mail services postage has to go,79
NA,1 think it has gone up in the course of this seat,79
NA,Government's short and inglorious term of office,79
NA,by something over 50 per cent when we take into or not.,79
NA,account the reduction in the weight of a letter,79
NA,and the present proposed increase in postal cause,79
NA,charges. I do not think wages have gone up as,79
NA,"much as that, so there must be less",79
NA,there was. With increasing mechanisation and,79
NA,technology one would have expected costs to go able,79
NA,up a great deal less than wages. This shows the remark?,79
NA,fundamental inefficiency of the Government.,79
NA,I have never been an advocate of low wages.,79
NA,am an advocate of high wages with high prohe,79
NA,ductivity but the trouble is that in this,79
NA,tion there has been a continuous loss of pro-,79
NA,ductivity. I do not beheve that this is due to the hes.,79
NA,average postal employee. Most of us know our,79
NA,own local postal employees and are on friendly,79
NA,terms with them. We beheve they do a good job,79
NA,insofar as they are aUowed to do so. But there,79
NA,2 things that stop them. Thefirstis the inherent,79
NA,^efficiency of the Government and the second,79
NA,"the industrial disruption imposed upon them,",79
NA,when very often they themselves do not want this,79
NA,"disruption, by their own mihtant unions who are",79
NA,making disruption not to help their members,79
NA,in order to break the whole social system. It is,79
NA,unhappy fact the postal unions have to a large,79
NA,extent faUen under the control of Marxists.,79
NA,want to give an example of something,79
NA,only a few months old and yet is very relevant.,79
NA,"Shortly before the elections the then Postmasterorder,",79
NA,"General, now the Special Minister of State",79
NA,"Lionel Bowen), went to the Redfern MaU",79
NA,Exchange to meet the employees. He was not,79
NA,companied by his own officials from that,79
NA,Exchange. He excluded them from the meeting I,79
NA,with the men although I beheve he had with him,79
NA,one person from his own central office.,79
Mr LIONEL BOWEN , I rise to order. The remark,79
NA,made by the honourable member that I excluded,79
NA,officials is untrue and I ask that it be withdrawn.,79
Mr WENTWORTH,I beheve it to be true,79
NA,and I can only say-,79
Mr LIONEL BOWEN , I raise a further point of,79
NA,order. It is a reflection on my position-,79
Mr WENTWORTH,I t is not a point of order,79
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,I t is a point of order.,79
NA,all.,79
NA,WENTWORTH-I t is not a point of order,79
NA,If the Minister wants to make a personal,79
NA,let him make it at the end of my,79
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Armitage)-,79

NA,while the point of order is being taken. I wUl,79
NA,make the decision whether it is a point of order,79
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,I t is a point of order be-,79
NA,it reflects on my action as a Minister. I ask,79
NA,that it be withdrawn. It has nothing to do with,79
NA,efficiency than misrepresentation.,79
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Will the honour-,79
NA,member for Mackellar withdraw the,79
Mr WENTWORTH,I f it is not a misrep-,79
NA,I resentation what is the Minister talking about? If,79
NA,wants to make a personal explanation at the,79
NA,mail secend of my speech he is entided to do so.,79
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Yo u are not entided to teU,79
Mr WENTWORTH,I am not telling Ues.,79
NA,What I am doing is repeating what was told to,79
NA,me by the Minister's officials at the Exchange,79
NA,are and I was told that the Minister excluded the,79
NA,officials from the Exchange although I was care-,79
NA,is ful to say that I beUeve he had with him some-,79
NA,body from his own central administration.,79
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I ask the,79
NA,but honourable member to resume his seat whUe I,79
NA,an give a ruling. I think it would be appropriate for,79
NA,the Minister to make a personal explanation,79
NA,I when the honourable member for Mackellar,79
NA,which is finishes speaking.,79
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Speakin g to the point of,79
NA,I want to make it clear that a statement,79
NA,( Mr was made based on hearsay. The honourable,79
NA,member is supposed to have some knowledge of,79
NA,acwhat he feels was the position and he has not,79
NA,named anybody who gave him that information.,79
NA,have said it is untrue. It is false and the fact that,79
NA,it is untrue and false does not entitle the honour-,79
NA,able member to let it stand so that I then am put,79
NA,in the position of saying that it was a misunder-,80
NA,"standing or a misrepresentation. It is a falsehood,",80
NA,"a lie, and it should never have been uttered. I ask",80
NA,that it be withdrawn because it is a reflection on,80
NA,me.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,Let me continue. I,80
NA,think I can satisfy the Minister.,80
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,A point of order,80
NA,has been taken. I think the Minister has made his,80
NA,point but the Chair is not in a position to deter-,80
NA,mine whether or not the statement is true. I think,80
NA,the Minister should make a personal explanation,80
NA,after the honourable member has finished,80
NA,speaking.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,I think I can satisfy the,80
NA,Minister. When I visited the exchange the senior,80
NA,officials there gave me this information. I was not,80
NA,present at the meeting myself and I do not know,80
NA,of my own knowledge who was present. But I am,80
NA,willing to swear that senior officials gave me this,80
NA,information and they said that although-,80
Mr LIONEL BOWEN , I want you to swear it now.,80
NA,Swear it now.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,"Yes, of course I do.",80
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,D o it now. Name them.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,I will not name them,80
NA,because you will victimise them. This is normal,80
NA,trade union standover tactics. You are out for,80
NA,victimisation.,80
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Yo u are a villain.,80
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Armitage)-,80
NA,Order! The honourable member will resume his,80
NA,seat. I ask that the interjections and the private,80
NA,meeting between the Minister and the honour-,80
NA,able member for Mackellar cease. The honour-,80
NA,able member should not be inviting interjections,80
NA,in the way he is doing.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,"Thank you, Mr Deputy",80
NA,Speaker. I thank you for your protection and for,80
NA,your wise ruling. I hope the Mimster will remain,80
NA,silent. I will say only that when I visited the,80
NA,exchange the Minister's own senior officials told,80
NA,me that people from the exchange were excluded,80
NA,"from the meeting, although there were represen-",80
NA,tatives from the organisation outside of the staff,80
NA,of the exchange itself.,80
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Ridiculous ! You are non-,80
NA,sensical.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,I was not present at the,80
NA,"meeting. I can only say what was said, but I have",80
NA,had independent evidence that at that meeting a,80
NA,series of demands was presented to the Mimster.,80
NA,He accepted them and said: ' If you elect us as the,80
NA,"government, this is what we will do'. I am told",80
NA,that the Minister put his signature on that series,80
NA,"of demands at the meeting. If this be untrue, let",80
NA,the Minister deny it.,80
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,O f course it is untrue. It is,80
NA,the second or third time you have said it.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,I t is thefirsttime I have,80
NA,said that.,80
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,"No , not at all.",80
Mr WENTWORTH,"I n the House, that is.",80
NA,There was a large number of people present at,80
NA,that meeting and they will know whether it be,80
NA,true or false. I dare say we will hear more about,80
NA,this in the near future. I am told and verily be-,80
NA,heve that the Minister put his signature on those,80
NA,demands at the meeting. He spoke to the men,80
NA,behind the backs of his own officers at the,80
NA,"exchange, although he did have others with him.",80
NA,He excluded from the meeting people from his,80
NA,"own exchange, people who were in charge ofthe",80
NA,"exchange. He capitulated to the men, and it is",80
NA,"most improper. If this story be true, the Minister",80
NA,did something which was dishonourable and it,80
NA,should entail his resignation from the Ministry.,80
NA,No Minister is entided to make election pledges,80
NA,with pubhc money and say ' I will do these things,80
NA,if you elect me'. Do it as a Minister? Do it,80
NA,secretly without letting it be known? I think we,80
NA,will hear more of this. I will be glad to have a,80
NA,statutory declaration from the Minister that he,80
NA,did not do any of these things.,80
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Wha t about yours first?,80
Mr WENTWORTH,You will have my,80
NA,statutory declaration in the morning. If there is a,80
NA,justice of the peace in the House I will do it for,80
NA,you tonight. We will then obtain your statutory,80
NA,"declaration in reply. I would like to have it, thank",80
NA,"you, since you started to make these challenges.",80
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Armitage)-,80
NA,The honourable member for Mackellar will ad-,80
NA,dress the Chair and not the Special Mimster of,80
NA,State.,80
Mr WENTWORTH,"Yes, I think that is",80
NA,"right. I have shown that the rises in charges,",80
NA,"which are not covering costs, are greater than the",80
NA,rises in wages. They are therefore due to,80
NA,organisational inefficiency and union disruption.,80
NA,I am not trying to blame the individual postal,80
NA,"employees because I think, with some excep-",80
NA,"tions, generally speaking they are very good and",80
NA,they deserve the commendation of this House,80
NA,and of people outside this House for the work,80
NA,that they do. I have had postmen come to me and,80
NA,"say:' Look, we do not want to go on strike. We do",80
NA,"not want to disrupt the mails, but if we do not go",80
NA,on strike we will be victimised.',80
NA,"Here we have the Minister, who has had some",81
NA,"association with trade unions, coming into this",81
NA,House and asking for the instruments of victimis-,81
NA,ation. I know exactly what he means when he,81
NA,says that. He wants to be able to victimise the,81
NA,people concerned. He is a trade unionist. He is,81
NA,one of the people who will be working these,81
NA,kinds of standover tactics in the unions-standin g,81
NA,over the men in the unions. I think he should be,81
NA,ashamed of himself because he used his position,81
NA,as a Mimster corruptly to offer bribes in the,81
NA,way-,81
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Yo u are a disgrace to the,81
NA,Parhament. You should not be in this House.,81
Mr WENTWORTH,"Will you protect me,",81
NA,Mr Deputy Speaker? WiU you protect me from,81
NA,this outrageous Mmister? I am sure you will as a,81
NA,fair and impartial man.,81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I triink that,81
NA,the honourable member for MackeUar is getting,81
NA,quite a fair time in this House and he usually,81
NA,does.,81
Mr SCHOLES ," Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a",81
NA,point of order. The honourable member for,81
NA,MackeUar had made certain charges which can,81
NA,be made against a member of this House only as,81
NA,a result of a substantive motion. I ask that you,81
NA,ask him either to make such a substantive motion,81
NA,or else to withdraw.,81
Mr HUNT ,O n a point of order-,81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Is the honourable,81
NA,member speaking to the point of order?,81
Mr HUNT , I am taking a point of order.,81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,A point of order,81
NA,has already been taken.,81
Mr HUNT , I wUl speak on the point of order,81
NA,"along these lines, Mr Deputy Speaker: If you up-",81
NA,hold that point of order I would expect you to,81
NA,rule that the comment that the Special Mimster,81
NA,of State at the table made both with his hands,81
NA,"and his mouth, giving the impression that the",81
NA,honourable member for MackeUar is deranged,81
NA,or insane and should not be a member of this,81
NA,"House, is offensive to an elected member of this",81
NA,Parhament. I think that there has been far too,81
NA,much tit for tat across the House here. If you are,81
NA,"going to accept a point of order on that, I think",81
NA,that another point of order should be taken,81
NA,against the comments that have been made here.,81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Armitage)-A,81
NA,point of order was taken and the honourable,81
NA,member for Gwydir spoke to the point of order. I,81
NA,have already ruled that the Chair is not in a pos-,81
NA,ition to state whether the statements made by the,81
NA,honourable member for Mackellar are correct. I,81
NA,tliink that the appropriate course would be for,81
NA,"the Minister, if he considers that he has been mis-",81
NA,"represented, to make a personal explanation",81
NA,after the honourable member for MackeUar has,81
NA,finished speaking. At this stage I want the House,81
NA,to return to the BUl and to finish the discussion on,81
NA,it.,81
Mr WENTWORTH,Thank you very much,81
NA,"indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker. I note how honour-",81
NA,able members opposite portray their background,81
NA,as miUtant unionists by rising in a body over this,81
NA,kind o f -,81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Armitage)-,81
NA,Order! I have already asked the honourable,81
NA,member for Mackellar not to stray from the BUl,81
NA,but to speak to the BUl. If the honourable,81
NA,member for Mackellar continues making per-,81
NA,sonal remarks against the Minister or any other,81
NA,member of this House I will have to sit him,81
NA,down.,81
Mr WENTWORTH,"Very well, sir. I have",81
NA,pointed out that the rises in charges which are,81
NA,imposed by this BUl-whic h the Minister says are,81
NA,necessary to meetrisesin costs-ar e greater than,81
NA,the rises in wages. They therefore measure,81
NA,"inefficiency in the Post Oflice. In my view, this",81
NA,"inefficiency springs from 2 causes. First, the",81
NA,inefficiency of the administration-whic h is the,81
NA,"Government-an d secondly, from the calculated",81
NA,disruption of certain small sections within the,81
NA,"unions concerned. I gave as an instance, and evi-",81
NA,"dence, of this something wliich was told to me. I",81
NA,wUl make a statutory declaration in a few mo-,81
NA,ments that it was told to me and I wUl not-,81
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! I have,81
NA,asked the honourable member for Mackellar to,81
NA,apply himself to matters continued within this,81
NA,BUl. I ask him to do that or I wUl have to ask him,81
NA,to resume his seat.,81
Mr WENTWORTH,I would make one,81
NA,other point and I think it is substantial. It is the,81
NA,Government's philosophy apparently that,81
NA,charges should be made to cover the costs of ser-,81
NA,vices such as the Post Office. I want to examine,81
NA,"that fundamental proposition. In my view,",81
NA,charges should certainly be made to cover outgo-,81
NA,ings whether for wages or for any other current,81
NA,expenditure. Charges should certainly cover,81
NA,"those costs. Certainly, fixed charges should go in",81
NA,for accounting purposes so that we know where,81
NA,"we stand. But with a Government service,",81
NA,"whether it be postal, raUways, or any other ser-",81
NA,"vice, whether it be State or Federal, it seems to",81
NA,me that we are now in a new kind of ball game,81
NA,with innation.,81
NA,"It appears to me also that governments, as an",82
NA,"anti-inflationary measure, should be reducing",82
NA,the charges for services to the current costs. I do,82
NA,not mean to say that they should not charge any,82
NA,interest but I tliink interest should be shown as a,82
NA,loss so that the true accounting of the service,82
NA,could be known because this is vital when one,82
NA,"considers capital extensions, whether they be for",82
NA,"the railways, the buses or the Post Office. I be-",82
NA,heve that it is important that the accounting be,82
NA,"kept. For these public services, one of the great",82
NA,things about an anti-inflationary pohcy must be,82
NA,surely that we should be reducing charges to the,82
NA,real costs. This is something which I beheve is,82
NA,fundamental. It concerns this Bill but it goes be-,82
NA,yond this Bill. I beheve that this real principle,82
NA,should be part ofthe anti-inflationary pohcy. We,82
NA,are in a position where an anti-inflationary pol-,82
NA,"icy is needed, new principles are needed, and",82
NA,"new thinking is needed. This Government, which",82
NA,"prides itself as being a progressive government,",82
NA,is really the victim of the old shibboleth-i t can-,82
NA,not really think in new terms-an d this Bill shows,82
NA,it.,82
Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,Kingsford-Smith-,82
NA,Special Minister of State) (5.39)-in reply-Until,82
NA,the last speech there had been a rather intelligent,82
NA,discussion as to what the BiU was reaUy all about.,82
NA,The BUl before us is virtuaUy the same BUl as was,82
NA,introduced some months ago but wbich was,82
NA,rejected by the Senate. The big issue today is:,82
NA,Why has it been necessary virtuaUy to increase,82
NA,the postage another lc because of the rejection of,82
NA,the earher BUl? Thefiguresprepared by the De-,82
NA,partment clearly show that the 2 months' delay,82
NA,resulted in a $30m deficit. Obviously if the De-,82
NA,partment cannot get the cashflowfrom the earn-,82
NA,ings it would have expected to receive from both,82
NA,"telecommunications and the postal service, it has",82
NA,been deprived of that amount of money. The,82
NA,amount now to be recovered is the same amount,82
NA,as would have been obtained if the proposed,82
NA,charges had become effective from 1 August.,82
NA,Due to the obstruction of the Senate the Depart-,82
NA,ment has been prevented from getting $146m in,82
NA,the period from 1 August last to 30 June next.,82
NA,The Government is now obhged to raise that,82
NA,sum of $ 146m in the period from 1 October to 30,82
NA,June next. It is very simple to understand that be-,82
NA,cause the Post Office has been deprived of that,82
NA,income it has now to be raised within a shorter,82
NA,period oftime.Accordingly the postage charges,82
NA,have had to be altered. Honourable members,82
NA,opposite should understand that it is on that,82
NA,basis that the charges have had to be increased.,82
NA,But let us look at the rapid way in which,82
NA,predecessors escalated postage charges.,82
NA,"did so in 1967, 1970 and 1971. In fact, postage",82
NA,rates were increased by 2c in 2 consecutive years.,82
NA,Although the conventions of Westminster clearly,82
NA,indicate that I cannot produce every detaU of,82
NA,"what my predecessor had, within his knowledge,",82
NA,on the basis of wages escalating at a certain rate,82
NA,it is quite clear that he would have had to,82
NA,increase postage rates again in 1973. We have,82
NA,not increased postage rates since they were last,82
NA,increased by the Opposition when it was in,82
NA,government. Postage rates were increased to 7c,82
NA,"in 1971. So virtuaUy there has been a 3-year gap,",82
NA,wbich never would have been within the busi-,82
NA,ness plan that the Opposition had in mind. I have,82
NA,in front of me information as to what the Oppo-,82
NA,"sition had in mind, and it is clear that postage",82
NA,rates were to be escalated much more rapidly,82
NA,than they have been.,82
NA,Opposition members have talked about,82
NA,"innovation, but not one of them has mentioned",82
NA,the fact that with these proposed postage rate,82
NA,increases the weight limit has now been,82
NA,"removed. In fact, the new postage rate covers all",82
NA,standard size letters. The concession is on the,82
NA,basis that the 20 gram minimum limit wUl no,82
NA,longer apply. The weight limit has been,82
NA,"removed, provided the letter is of a relatively",82
NA,"standard size. Most maU, of course, comes from",82
NA,commercial enterprise. The Post Office handles,82
NA,few domestic letters. People in commerce wUl,82
NA,obtain a benefit because whereas in the past-,82
NA,this was the situation even under the system of,82
NA,our predecessors-the y would have had to pay,82
NA,weU over 15c they wUl now be able to get vir-,82
NA,tually the same concession for 10c. So there has,82
NA,been no increase in postage rates in the commer-,82
NA,cial field.,82
NA,I must mention also the Vernon Commission,82
NA,which we estabhshed. Honourable members op-,82
NA,posite have spoken only about the need for,82
NA,innovation and the need to improve the Post,82
NA,Office. What did they do about it? They did noth-,82
NA,ing. Every year they simply introduced a Budget,82
NA,which increased the rates set on the previous,82
NA,occasion. On that basis the Opposition is indicted,82
NA,because it made no survey of what was wrong,82
NA,with the Post Office. It took this Government to,82
NA,estabhsh the royal commission. The Vernon,82
NA,Commission has come in with its report and has,82
NA,"said: 'Yes, separate the postal service from tele-",82
NA,communications'. The Opposition would not,82
NA,have done a thing about that. How many Post,82
NA,Offices were closed and how many services were,82
NA,lost during the Opposition's adnunistration? If it,82
NA,is ulegal for private enterprise to operate courier,82
NA,"our services, as was suggested by one honourable",82
NA,"They member opposite, why did the Opposition do",82
NA,nothing about it when it was in government? It,83
NA,let them nourish. Even though members opthe,83
NA,"posite now claim that they are illegal, when",83
NA,government they allowed such services to opercountry.,83
NA,ate. It is perfectly legal for such services to,83
NA,ate. But Uie Opposition would,83
NA,vices be left to private enterprise than to allow,83
NA,the Post Office to run them. Does the Opposition,83
NA,say that it did not prevent the Post Office from,83
NA,running a courier service? It is only now,83
NA,this legislation that the Post Office is given the,83
NA,sort of opportunity that it needs to compete in,83
NA,field that might be deemed to be reasonable.,83
NA,Somebody in the Opposition back benches said,83
NA,that that is wrong also because it will put the,83
NA,vate courier services out of business. In other,83
NA,"words, the good old Post Office can take the",83
NA,"broken down arrangements, the long hauls, and",83
NA,"everything that nobody else wants, but it should",83
NA,never be given the benefit of competing on,83
NA,equal basis.,83
NA,The Opposition should have a look at what,83
NA,has done with its economics. The superannuation,83
NA,scheme was so badly organised- I cannot blame,83
NA,any members of the Opposition for that; neverday's,83
NA,theless it was part of their Government's systheir,83
NA,tem-tha t the previous Government did not even,83
NA,establish what was needed in the superannuation,83
NA,fund. That was not known until we had the Verafternoon.,83
NA,non Commission. It is estabhshed now that the,83
NA,Post Office is some $31 lm in arrears in its,83
NA,annuation fund. Under the Bill now before,83
NA,House we have to pay the Treasury $130m for,83
NA,superannuation. That happened under the Ophard,83
NA,position Parties' scheme and under the Treasury,83
NA,of which they were in control. It took us,83
NA,out these facts. But not one member of the Oppowhereby,83
NA,sition has mentioned that.,83
NA,What is it that honourable members opposite,83
NA,are debating today in regard to this Bill? They,83
NA,are the greatest lot of whingers I have ever seen,83
NA,as far as talking about what is wrong with,83
NA,fellow Austrahans is concerned. One honourable,83
NA,member talked about how he would march on in life.,83
NA,the city with a pitchfork or something. What do,83
NA,they tliink the city people are-alien s or,83
NA,They are their fellow men. Honourable members,83
NA,opposite are trying to stir up this utter rubbish,83
NA,about what is wrong with their city brothers.,83
NA,They are paying the same telephone rental.,83
NA,honourable members opposite look at the telebreaks,83
NA,communications system they will see that it,83
NA,makes a profit only because of the fellow who,83
NA,uses the telephone every two or three minutes.,83
NA,The money that we get from the bills with which,83
NA,we sock those city people is what makes the,83
NA,plus. We do not want to go into what benefit,83
NA,"get from it, but they are certainly paying through",83
NA,proper channels and making the surplus that,83
NA,in we spread into capital outlay throughout the,83
NA,That is not a new concept; it was the,83
NA,"operconcept of any previous government, naturally,",83
NA,rather courier serto get its funds.,83
NA,Not one honourable member opposite men-,83
NA,tioned that this Government has written off the,83
NA,under postal debt which the Opposition Parties,83
NA,graciously imposed as a result ofa decision by Sir,83
NA,a Robert Menzies in 1960. We have written it off,83
NA,and saved the postal service some $17m in,83
NA,interest. The Opposition Parties' stupid old ar-,83
NA,prirangement from 1960 on was that the poor old,83
NA,Post Office had to pay interest on the money it,83
NA,received. The Post Office has been bogged down,83
NA,with all these outmoded ideas that the Oppo-,83
NA,sition Parties foisted upon it. Honourable,83
NA,an members opposite did nothing about them; yet,83
NA,they come here and bash the fellows in the ser-,83
NA,vice. The people in Bendigo must be astounded,83
NA,it to hear what their member says about the postal,83
NA,employees in Bendigo. He virtually accuses them,83
NA,of being loafers who are not prepared to do a,83
NA,work. I will be amazed if he expects to get,83
NA,support the next time he fronts up for an,83
NA,election. That is ah he did and that is all most,83
NA,honourable members opposite have done this,83
NA,superHonourable members opposite were saying:,83
NA,the 'What is wrong with the workers? Why won't,83
NA,they work harder?' The workers are working,83
NA,enough. The big issue is that there has to be,83
NA,more incentive. There has to be some eradication,83
NA,to findof this outmoded Public Service structure,83
NA,a chap can go from the Fourth Division,83
NA,into the Third Division only if he has some certi-,83
NA,ficate. There are chaps in the service who have,83
NA,no promotional incentive and no pay incentive.,83
NA,Are they going to be revitalised by the suggestion,83
NA,that they ought to work harder? Obviously there,83
NA,"their must be some incentive, some retraining and",83
NA,some opportunities for them to improve their lot,83
NA,enemies? What did the Opposition parties do? They,83
NA,"built the Redfern Mail Exchange, a monster of a",83
NA,thing from the point of view of humanity. The,83
NA,idea was to put a whole lot of people together,83
NA,If with a whole lot of mail and a machine that,83
NA,down perhaps more often than it should.,83
NA,"We will not criticise the machine, because it has",83
NA,been improved. It was the only one of its kind in,83
NA,the world and there has been nothing Uke it,83
NA,since. Let me make clear what members of the,83
NA,surOpposition did and how their predecessors ran,83
NA,theyoff to become directors of the companies which,83
NA,were associated with the supply of equipment.,84
NA,What about that sort of arrangement?,84
NA,What about the thousands of people working,84
NA,at Redfern whom nobody ever bothers to go and,84
NA,see? Because I go and see them some honourable,84
NA,member here says to me: 'You are guilty of vic-,84
NA,"timisation, corruption and goodness knows",84
NA,what'. Let me make it clear that I did go to see,84
NA,"them. I went with Mr Milton Stevens, the Direc-",84
NA,tor of Postal Services in Sydney. The honourable,84
NA,"member to whom I am referring was not there,",84
NA,of course; so he would not know. But he says that,84
NA,he was told that I went without anybody else.,84
NA,Could anyone imagine all the people in the entire,84
NA,Redfern Mail Exchange being able to organise a,84
NA,meeting without anybody else knowing about it?,84
NA,The meeting was arranged with the consent of,84
NA,the Department and everybody knew it was to,84
NA,be held. The television cameramen and every-,84
NA,body else were there and it was held with full,84
NA,pubhcity. Mr Milton Stevens was the departmen-,84
NA,tal man there. The honourable member con-,84
NA,cerned rang my office after that and asked,84
NA,whether he could go there. He asked whether he,84
NA,could take his television cameras. I said that I,84
NA,would be deUghted. He went there with his own,84
NA,set offilmprojectors. Whatever happened to the,84
NA,film I do not know. I do not know whether any-,84
NA,body saw it. He went there to discuss the pos-,84
NA,ition. I do not want to give any more credit to the,84
NA,honourable member. He is in the eve of his pol-,84
NA,"itical life, due to retire, and he can use words",84
NA,such as 'victimisation' and 'corruption' and get,84
NA,"away with it, because apparendy under the",84
NA,"Standing Orders, as they are interpreted, some-",84
NA,one can slander and hbel you as much as he Ukes,84
NA,but you have to do your best in a personal expla-,84
NA,"nation. That is not my style, and I do not intend",84
NA,to put any more weight on the argument that was,84
NA,put forward.,84
NA,Let us look at what we are discussing. We have,84
NA,now the report of the royal commission. It,84
NA,establishes now that the Post Office is to be a vi-,84
NA,able proposition. It is to earn sufficient to pay its,84
NA,"way. Of course, in its postal operations, which are",84
NA,"labour intensive, it has to pay the wages of the",84
NA,people who are employed. If we had adopted the,84
NA,Senate assessment ofthe situation and had been,84
NA,deprived of the $30m we wanted and have now,84
NA,got in this BUl-th e Opposition has at last said it,84
NA,"will approve it, having had second thoughts, but",84
NA,the position still holds if the Opposition does not,84
NA,approve the BUl and the BUl is rejected-ho w,84
NA,many thousands of men would be sacked from,84
NA,the Post Office? We wiU have to sack at least,84
NA,"5,000. Five thousand employees are depending",84
NA,on this BUl going through. How does the Oppo-,84
NA,sition face up to that responsibUity?,84
NA,It was made clear to the Premiers by the Prime,84
NA,Minister ( Mr Whitlam) on 7 June that the postal,84
NA,allocation would remain at $385m and that he,84
NA,expected the Premiers to maintain their position,84
NA,"also. As honourable members know, the Prem-",84
NA,iers have been put in the position of having to,84
NA,"mcrease petrol charges, freight rates and every-",84
NA,thing else to maintain their services. We would,84
NA,not be honest if we were now to say we did not,84
NA,"really mean what we said to the Premiers, that",84
NA,we wUl change our mind and borrow more,84
NA,money. This has always been the attitude of the,84
NA,past.,84
NA,Sir James Vernon was right. We should separ-,84
NA,ate the postal and telecommunications functions,84
NA,"of the Post Office, because one is viable and the",84
NA,other wiU possibly always need a subsidy. Look,84
NA,at what the Country Party did. I give it credit for,84
NA,doing it. On the last occasion we discussed,84
NA,increases in post and telegraph charges the,84
NA,Country Party successfuUy moved an amend-,84
NA,ment that gave very good concessions to the,84
NA,registered publications. Members of the Country,84
NA,Party wUl be deUghted to know that this con-,84
NA,cession will result in a loss of $ 12m in the coming,84
NA,year. They should not think that every charge is,84
NA,based on the cost of the service provided. When,84
NA,their country cousins have to put a 10c stamp on,84
NA,a letter they should remember that they are sub-,84
NA,"sidising the local newspaper, which is going",84
NA,through the post at a cost of 2.5c or 4c. We are,84
NA,losing mUUons of dollars by granting a con-,84
NA,cession on these newspapers. The Country Party,84
NA,wiU not let us run the Post Office on the basis that,84
NA,everybody pays a fair rate. The registered publi-,84
NA,"cations, particularly newspapers in the country",84
NA,"areas, have to be subsidised, and that is what has",84
NA,happened. We have accepted the position be-,84
NA,cause that is the only way we could get last year's,84
NA,Post and Telegraph Rates BUl through. I know,84
NA,that the Country Party claims this concession as a,84
NA,"great credit. It is entitled to the credit, but it must",84
NA,bear the odium ofthe fact that it has also guaran-,84
NA,teed the people who use the postal services and,84
NA,the telephone services that they wUl subsidise,84
NA,country newspapers. I do not think that is fair.,84
NA,Mr Nixon-Wha t about trade union papers?,84
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,The honourable,84
NA,member used that argument in another debate,84
NA,today. The best thing to say is this: Let us put -he,84
NA,Post Office on the basis that Sir James Vernon,84
NA,wanted. Let us have a corporation representative,84
NA,of people who use the postal service and who are,84
NA,interested in its welfare. Let us put the Post Office,84
NA,on a viable basis. Let us develop courier services,85
NA,in the Post Office. We can make the Post Office,85
NA,something worth while. Let us give the em-,85
NA,ployees more incentive. Let us decentralise and,85
NA,develop regional concepts. Let us get away from,85
NA,having State directors. Let us cross State bound-,85
NA,aries and do something that can make the Post,85
NA,Office really move. Let us give the man in the,85
NA,town and the man in the country the right to be,85
NA,the man who makes the decision so that he is not,85
NA,bound down by some bureaucratic struggle that,85
NA,eventually has to be referred to Melbourne to be,85
NA,interpreted. That is what the concept of the royal,85
NA,commission means. Not one honourable,85
NA,member opposite has mentioned that or praised,85
NA,it. It is the position that will apply. We wiil get rid,85
NA,of that wretched concept that has been with us,85
NA,since 1900 that because there is a River Murray,85
NA,you must have different sets of rules on either,85
NA,side of the border. What I have outlined can hap-,85
NA,pen.,85
NA,Mr Nixon-Thi s has nothing to do with the,85
NA,debate.,85
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Unfortunately the,85
NA,honourable member was not present during the,85
NA,debate. I am surprised that I have to castigate,85
NA,him on that point. During the course of the de-,85
NA,"bate, when the honourable member for",85
NA,"Gippsland was not here, honourable members",85
NA,opposite were saying how inefficient the arrange-,85
NA,ments have been. The honourable member for,85
NA,Hume ( Mr Lusher) spent most of his time talk-,85
NA,ing about railways. I cannot solve the railway's,85
NA,"problems, but at least I am entitled to say that we",85
NA,can solve some of the regional concepts if we get,85
NA,put into these areas people who can overcome,85
NA,the immediate issues.,85
Mr LUSHER ,Bu t some mail goes by rail.,85
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I am sure they will be,85
NA,fixed by next Sunday. I am told that railway,85
NA,vices will be all right from 22 September 1974.,85
NA,This has nothing to do with the,85
NA,inform the honourable member for Hume that,85
NA,this is the position.,85
NA,The point I come to is this: The Senate caused,85
NA,the problem that honourable members opposite,85
NA,"are now anxious to avoid, but the mathematics",85
NA,are there and they cannot deny,85
NA,honourable members opposite have stated what,85
NA,they feel is wrong basically in their own elector-,85
NA,ates. I come to the issue of what,85
NA,with the whole concept. It has been the problem,85
NA,of interest and failure to understand superannucannot,85
NA,ation habihty. The general problem has been,85
NA,of not giving employees incentive or an oppor-,85
NA,tunity for advancement. The former Govern-,85
NA,"ment's arrangements, which were within its",85
NA,"knowledge, made it quite clear that service",85
NA,charges would have to escalate because the,85
NA,whole problem in this field was that the Post,85
NA,Office was regarded as a commercial enterprise.,85
NA,That has been the biggest problem with regard,85
NA,"to rural lines. It costs at least $3,000 of the tax-",85
NA,payers' money to install the first 8 kilometres.,85
NA,That is a contribution. But if one is hving well out,85
NA,in the country one cannot expect the service to be,85
NA,"provided free, which was the concept of the pre-",85
NA,vious Government. That concept ran into enor-,85
NA,mous habihties of approximately $21m already,85
NA,expended with an annual loss because of the,85
NA,interest paid on it. People in those areas could,85
NA,not possibly use the service enough even to pay,85
NA,the interest charges. That was the position that,85
NA,had to be looked at. Not one member of the Op-,85
NA,position has said that this Government has,85
NA,"reduced call charges for the first 50 kilometres,",85
NA,"particularly after 6 p.m., to 6c. That is a great",85
NA,"saving to many people. It is a $3m cost saving,",85
NA,and it shows the advantage of using the service at,85
NA,off-peak times at reasonable cost.,85
NA,The other point that is important in the whole,85
NA,concept of telecommunications is that it is,85
NA,"expanding all the time. That is a good concept,",85
NA,but it is an expensive concept. Trunk call usage is,85
NA,expanding by 13 per cent a year. People are,85
NA,using the service. We must meet the demand.,85
NA,Last year we made a record number of installa-,85
NA,tions-an all-time record. Demand was an all-,85
NA,time record also. So we must invest this money,85
NA,back into the business. All that Opposition,85
NA,speakers have done this evening is to go on with,85
NA,a series of complaints that they could have made,85
NA,in any adjournment debate. Not one of them,85
NA,"looked at the question of how postal charges,",85
NA,rates or weights could be altered. Not one of,85
NA,them can deny that the charges appear to be,85
NA,"serreasonable, except for the unreasonable amend-",85
NA,ments which the Opposition moved last year.,85
NA,"debate, but I That is the position.",85
NA,Mr Donald Cameron-The y are not unreason-,85
NA,able.,85
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,They are very,85
NA,reasonable by world standards. The Opposition,85
NA,"again wants to decry postal employees, because",85
NA,that. A number of that is all it did.,85
NA,Mr Donald Cameron- I said that the whole,85
NA,has been wrong system is inefficient.,85
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,Opposition members,85
NA,face up to the fact that it is their fellow,85
NA,one Australians whom they are castigating all the,85
NA,time. Their fellow Austrahans are running the,86
NA,postal service. Members opposite are so upset,86
NA,"about it, on the basis of what? The Opposition",86
NA,did nothing about it. It did nothing to improve,86
NA,the service. All it ever did was increase charges.,86
NA,All it ever did was give hand-outs in areas which,86
NA,are causing greater losses than ever. It cannot,86
NA,avoid the fact that it was the previous Govern-,86
NA,"ment that put on it the great interest burden, par-",86
NA,ticularly in the postal section,86
NA,Mr Donald Cameron-H e is telling hes.,86

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Order! The,86
NA,honourable member for Griffith will withdraw,86
NA,that remark.,86
NA,Mr Donald Cameron- I withdraw it.,86
Mr LIONEL BOWEN,I wanted to make this,86
NA,position completely clear for honourable,86
NA,members opposite. The same Bill is being,86
NA,introduced again because of the Senate obstruc-,86
NA,tion. It is achieving no more than it was intended,86
NA,to do before.,86

NA,Order! Does the honourable member claim to,86
NA,have been misrepresented?,86
Mr WENTWORTH,Yes. The Special Min-,86
NA,ister of State ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has seriously,86
NA,misrepresented the facts in regard to my visit to,86
NA,the Redfern Mail Exchange. As he asked me to,86
NA,"do, I have set out the true facts in a statutory dec-",86
NA,laration. If the House were to give me its indul-,86

Mr DONALD CAMERON,I am not against,86

NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,87
Mr YOUNG ,"Port Adelaide)- Mr Speaker, I",87
NA,wish to make a personal explanation.,87
Mr SPEAKER,Does the honourable gende-,87
NA,man claim to have been misrepresented?,87
Mr YOUNG,"Yes , I do, Mr Speaker. I refer to",87
NA,the debate on the censure modon which took,87
NA,place in the House yesterday. As reported at,87
NA,"page 1442 of yesterday's Hansard, the Leader of",87
NA,the Opposidon ( Mr Snedden) made the com-,87
NA,ment during the debate that he expected the,87
NA,Austrahan Council Bill to come before the House,87
NA,today. Being one of the speakers from the,87
NA,"Government side on the Austrahan Council Bill,",87
NA,I have been involved in discussions with people,87
NA,who have visited Parhament House in Canberra,87
NA,this week concerning the sections of the Bill,87
NA,which are causing some controversy outside this,87
NA,place. The Leader of the Opposition made the,87
NA,comment that information that had been given,87
NA,to the Opposition by me indicated that the Aus-,87
NA,tralian Council Bill would not come before the,87
NA,"House. Mr Speaker, that is not correct. As I have",87
NA,"said, I have held discussions concerning the Bill",87
NA,with people who visited Canberra. I did make,87
NA,inquiries as to when the Bill would come before,87
NA,the House. I did not at any stage talk to any,87
NA,"member of the Opposition, includmg the Leader",87
NA,"of the Opposition, about the make-up of the",87
NA,business that would come before the House. As,87
NA,"all honourable members will understand, those",87
NA,of us who serve on the back benches do not have,87
NA,anything to do with deciding what business,87
NA,comes before the House. In that manner I was,87
NA,misrepresented in the House yesterday.,87
NA,WHEAT INDUSTRY STABILISATION,87
NA,Debate resumed from 17 July (vide page,87
NA,"294), on motion by Dr Patterson:",87
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,87
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson-Minister for,87
NA,Northern Development and Minister for the,87
NA,"Northern Territory)- Mr Speaker, may I have",87
NA,the indulgence of the House to raise a point of,87
NA,procedure on this legislation? Before the debate,87
NA,is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that,87
NA,it may suit the convenience ofthe House to have,87
NA,"a general debate covering this Bill, the Wheat",87
NA,Products Export Adjustment Bill and the Wheat,87
NA,Export Charge Bill as they are related measures.,87
NA,Separate questions will of course be put on each,87
NA,of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I sug-,87
NA,"gest therefore, Mr Speaker, that you permit the",87
NA,subject matter of the 3 BiUs to be discussed in this,87
NA,debate.,87
Mr SPEAKER,Is it the wish ofthe House to,87
NA,"adopt this procedure? There being no objection,",87
NA,I wUl aUow that course to be foUowed.,87
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (8.3)- Mr,87
NA,"Speaker, the 3 BUls that we are considering to-",87
NA,night are BUls that politically are and have been,87
NA,traditionally the fundamental basis upon which,87
NA,many AustraUan farmers have been able to sur-,87
NA,vive the swing of the pendulum of seasons and,87
NA,the swing of the pendulum of markets. In the,87
NA,"past the wheat seats, as they were called, were",87
NA,the seats that determined the fate of the govern-,87
NA,"ment in this ParUament. Of course, these 3 BUls",87
NA,are radically different from the original stabUis-,87
NA,ation proposals that were introduced into this,87
NA,"ParUament. One wonders how Mr Reg Pollard, a",87
NA,former Minister for Commerce and Agricul-,87
NA,ture- a Labor member and one of those who,87
NA,originaUy introduced the wheat stabUisation,87
NA,legislation-might regard a BUl which goes by,87
NA,"that pseudonym but which is, in fact, more a pay-",87
NA,ments equalisation measure than a stabUisation,87
NA,measure.,87
NA,"Nonetheless, these 3 BUls encompass a range",87
NA,of assistance to the wheat growers of Australia,87
NA,"which has resulted from discussions, if one can",87
NA,caU them that. They were discussions but they,87
NA,were conducted under a measure of duress with,87
NA,the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and,87
NA,with the members of the Austrahan Agricultural,87
NA,CouncU. The proposals themselves are designed,87
NA,to provide assistance to those who will produce,87
NA,wheat during the next 5 years. As members of,87
NA,"this place and wheat growers generaUy know,",87
NA,the previous S-year wheat stabUisation scheme,87
NA,BILL 1974 was extended for a period of one year. Over that,87
NA,Second Reading period the present Labor Government changed,87
NA,generally the character of the negotiations which,87
NA,I had entered into prior to the change of govern-,87
NA,ment and indeed changed the substance of the,87
NA,stabUisation proposals offered to the industry.,87
NA,I think it is appropriate that I deal first with the,87
NA,measures that the Government has brought for-,87
NA,"ward, rather than the alternative proposals I",87
NA,would Uke to have seen developed. I think it is,87
NA,also appropriate at this stage to say that in the,87
NA,industry there has been quite real concern at the,87
NA,delay in debating this measure in this chamber. It,87
NA,is 3 months and 2 days today since the BUl was,87
NA,first introduced into the House. The Opposition,87
NA,had hoped that the debate might have taken,87
NA,place during the July sitting. For various reasons,87
NA,this apparently did not meet the wishes of the,88
NA,Government. While the Minister for Northern,88
NA,Development and Minister for the Northern Ter-,88
NA,ritory (Dr Patterson) said in his second reading,88
NA,speech that there was some delay because of the,88
NA,"18 May election, I think that it is equally true to",88
NA,say that it is unfortunate that there was not an,88
NA,opportunity for the measures to be debated in,88
NA,July and for wheatgrowers generally to be cer-,88
NA,tain ofthe result.,88
NA,"However, I think there is some merit in having",88
NA,a look at the contrast between circumstances that,88
NA,"prevail today and those that prevailed, not in",88
NA,"July, but in the first of the intervening years be-",88
NA,tween the termination of the preceding stabilis-,88
NA,ation scheme and the introduction of this one. Of,88
NA,course the significant change is that generally,88
NA,grain stocks around the world have dwindled,88
NA,mto negligible quantities. While in some coun-,88
NA,tries there has been a reasonable level of pro-,88
NA,duction -fo r example in the United States of,88
NA,"America, which is still one of the world's largest",88
NA,"wheat producers, there is this year a record",88
NA,crop-grain s today are more interchangeable,88
NA,than they have been. No longer do those who are,88
NA,in the market for wheat look at wheat as only a,88
NA,grain produced for human consumption; rather,88
NA,it is seen to a greater degree than perhaps it has,88
NA,been in the past as one of a range of grains,88
NA,produced either for human consumption or for,88
NA,stock feed purposes. In a blend availabUity of,88
NA,"wheat alone is not the price determining factor,",88
NA,but its avaUabUity relative to the avaUabUity of,88
NA,"other grains such as corn and nulo, and also",88
NA,"other crops such as soya beans, all of which to a",88
NA,"degree are interchangeable, and certainly all",88
NA,"have a place for purposes of stock feeding,",88
NA,perhaps more than for human consumption.,88
NA,"The legislation consists of 3 distinct BUls, the",88
NA,"Wheat Industry StabUisation BUl, the Wheat",88
NA,Products Export Adjustment BiU and the Wheat,88
NA,"Export Charge BiU. As I have suggested, the title",88
NA,of the Wheat Industry StabUisation BUl is a mis-,88
NA,"nomer. As I see it, it would be far better called",88
NA,the Wheat Industry EquaUsation BUl. The Oppo-,88
NA,sition regards this as one ofthe more regrettable,88
NA,consequences ofthe changes which this Govern-,88
NA,ment has introduced. In the present economic cU-,88
NA,mate for grains the wheat growers of Austraha,88
NA,wUl make a significant contribution to the con-,88
NA,sumers throughout AustraUa which regrettably,88
NA,wUl not be recognised or wiU too rarely be recog-,88
NA,nised. In the past wheat growers have been pre-,88
NA,pared to accept a domestic price plan which has,88
NA,provided stabUity for the industry and they have,88
NA,taken their chance on the export returns. For the,88
NA,time being the current domestic price set within,88
NA,Austraha for home consumption is significantly,88
NA,lower than the world export price. The stabUis-,88
NA,ation price set within this legislation is $2 per,88
NA,bushel. About a fortnight ago in the Kansas City,88
NA,Grain Exchange grain was bemg sold at US$4.61,88
NA,a bushel. That was a price which it was accepted,88
NA,might well not be avaUable at the low point of,88
NA,"the season and indeed, it was significantly lower",88
NA,than some of the prices that had been offered,88
NA,some weeks before. So the price being paid,88
NA,domestically in AustraUa to Australian wheat,88
NA,growers under this arrangement wUl mean a sig-,88
NA,nificant contribution by. the wheat growers in,88
NA,"respect of the 80,000-odd tonnes of wheat that is",88
NA,used within Australia for domestic purposes. It is,88
NA,being offered to consumers in this country at a,88
NA,significant discount but wheat growers accept,88
NA,that as part of the provisions of this stabUisation,88
NA,scheme as it has been in other schemes. It is a,88
NA,recogmtion by wheat growers that this predeter-,88
NA,mined price does give them a basis on which they,88
NA,can produce profitably. Therefore they are pre-,88
NA,pared also to produce greater quantities of wheat,88
NA,which supplements Australia's export earnings.,88
NA,Assistance is also given to the provision of those,88
NA,funds which are necessary tofinanceour national,88
NA,development and the achievement of national,88
NA,objectives which in the past have been set by the,88
NA,avaUabUity of funds but today seem to be set,88
NA,more by the ideology of the Government than,88
NA,the nation's capacity to pay.,88
NA,Within the provisions of the scheme those,88
NA,aspects to which I think reference needs to be,88
NA,made include the degree to which the stabUis-,88
NA,ation scheme itself has been changed as far as the,88
NA,owners-operators' allowance from the earUer,88
NA,scheme is concerned. There is a change in the,88
NA,basis by which industry and Government wUl,88
NA,contribute to the StabUisation Fund from which,88
NA,amounts are to be paid to wheat growers. There,88
NA,is certainly a change in the terminology of the,88
NA,basic wheat and in this respect the Opposition,88
NA,completely supports the proposal of the Govern-,88
NA,ment. The old 'fair average quaUty' terminology,88
NA,has been changed to 'Australian standard white'.,88
NA,There have also been changes in respect of some,88
NA,of the provisions related to unauthorised deal-,88
NA,"ings with wheat which, of course, wUl be",88
NA,reflected in the complementary State legislation.,88
NA,These provisions are designed to minimise across,88
NA,the border trading particularly in respect of,88
NA,wheat that is being produced on leased land. The,88
NA,other aspect of change to which the Minister,88
NA,referred in his second reading speech and which,88
NA,"has some importance, I believe, is the",88
NA,requirement of the Australian Wheat Board to,88
NA,tender an annual report on its operations. The,89
NA,Opposition completely supports that aspect too.,89
NA,The second of the 2 Bills- I will come back to,89
NA,deal with each of them in a htde more detail-i s,89
NA,termed the Wheat Products Export Adjustment,89
NA,Bill. This BUl really authorises the Board to,89
NA,require exporters of wheat products to pay to the,89
NA,Board the difference on those occasions when the,89
NA,export prices are higher than the domestic prices.,89
NA,"So in fact an exporter, protected as he normally is",89
NA,against a disadvantage in export markets when,89
NA,export prices of wheat are lower than domestic,89
NA,"prices, is prohibited from gaining an advantage",89
NA,in producing his product at a time when export,89
NA,prices are higher.,89
NA,This highlights one of the areas of deficiency,89
NA,"this scheme, the faUure of the Government to",89
NA,realise some of the problems of the processors of,89
NA,wheat and wheat products. In the course of the,89
NA,last few months I have had some discussions with,89
NA,those who are in this category and each has,89
NA,expressed concern at the general impUcations of,89
NA,the provisions that the Government has brought,89
NA,forward and at the Government's faUure to con-,89
NA,"sider the problems of avaUabUity of grain, the",89
NA,avaUabUity of grain of different classes and their,89
NA,abUity to compete in production of gluten or,89
NA,whatever the by-product might be with those,89
NA,who are producing that particular product either,89
NA,from other grains or in particularly advan-,89
NA,"tageous geographic locations. For example,",89
NA,some advantage is given to an exporter of wheat,89
NA,products and a processor of wheat products who,89
NA,is now located in Tasmama. He gains through,89
NA,some of the provisions of this legislation from the,89
NA,equaUsation of wheat prices in that State an,89
NA,advantage over wheat processors on the,89
NA,mainland.,89
NA,The scheme set out in the Wheat Industry,89
NA,StabUization BUl is radically different from pre-,89
NA,vious StabUization schemes. It reflects generally,89
NA,the bias that this Government has against rural,89
NA,industries and which has never been better,89
NA,demonstrated than by the complete faUure of the,89
NA,Government to consider the problems of rural,89
NA,industries in the Budget presented on Tuesday,89
NA,night. Although the Government can claim that,89
NA,this wheat legislation was negotiated with and,89
NA,finally approved by the A u s t r a l i a n,89
NA,"Wheatgrowers Federation, there is no doubt in",89
NA,the mind of every wheat grower in Austraha that,89
NA,it was a very unsatisfactory set of negotiations.,89
NA,As recendy as last weekend violent objections,89
NA,were lodged up in Moree in northern New South,89
NA,Wales to the imphcations of this type of legis-,89
NA,lation which for so many seems to capitahse on,89
NA,the presently advantageous world market con-,89
NA,ditions but prejudices the long term opportuni-,89
NA,ties for wheat production. I do not think it is,89
NA,unfair to say that the Wheatgrowers' Federation,89
NA,was bullied and cajoled generaUy with threats of,89
NA,intimidation and references to the Industries As-,89
NA,sistance Commission and all sorts of other,89
NA,alternatives to the point where it had no alterna-,89
NA,tive but to accept the proposals put to it by the,89
NA,AustraUan Government.,89
NA,SimUarly the objections raised by individual,89
NA,States were taken into account only to a minimal,89
NA,degree. It is unfortunate that the process of for-,89
NA,mulation of pohcy by this Government tends,89
NA,more and more to ignore the wishes of the,89
NA,individual and of the States but pursues a,89
NA,in philosophical bent which in the consequence I,89
NA,am afraid wUl lead to a marked disadvantage to,89
NA,the whole of our Austrahan community. The,89
NA,"Federation, of course, was told to accept this pro-",89
NA,posal or there would be no StabUization scheme,89
NA,"or that the scheme would have to go, if there was",89
NA,"to be one at all, to the Industries Assistance Com-",89
NA,mission. With the traumas that many wheat,89
NA,growers have had over the last few years and,89
NA,with the problems which they now foresee in,89
NA,generally maintaining their profitability most,89
NA,wheat growers believed that they would just,89
NA,have to accept the scheme. It was for that reason,89
NA,and in spite of very real objections by some,89
NA,members of the Federation that the Federation,89
NA,finally accepted the proposals.,89
NA,SimUarly both Labor and non-labor govern-,89
NA,ments expressed their reservations at the Aus-,89
NA,tralian Agricultural CouncU about the manner in,89
NA,which the negotiations were carried out and on,89
NA,some aspects of the scheme itself. Many of these,89
NA,governments have approached members of the,89
NA,Opposition suggesting that we should move sub-,89
NA,stantive amendments to the proposals now be-,89
NA,fore us. It is very tempting for those of us who,89
NA,have a genuine interest and concern for pro-,89
NA,"ducers to do so. But were we to do so, this being",89
NA,"19 September, we would be in a position where it",89
NA,would be impossible for those who are produc-,89
NA,ing wheat and wUl have it delivered to sUos,89
NA,within the next two or three weeks to know,89
NA,where they were going. Therefore we in the Op-,89
NA,position feel that we are being precluded from,89
NA,moving any substantive changes to this legis-,89
NA,lation. We are supporting this legislation not be-,89
NA,cause we believe it is good but because of the,89
NA,time factor and the lack of opportunity for us to,89
NA,change the legislation in a way that we believe,89
NA,"would be desirable if the wheat growers, con-",89
NA,sumers and the interests of all Australia were to,89
NA,be taken properly into account.,89
NA,In many ways this scheme is quite inferior,90
NA,earher schemes It reduces the level of protection,90
NA,available to growers that was set out in former,90
NA,schemes. It reduces the level of government,90
NA,involvement in mamtaining the viabUity of productivity.,90
NA,AustraUa's major dry land farming industry.,90
NA,reduces the future potential of wheat growers to,90
NA,maintain their volume of production in the Ught,90
NA,of growing world food needs if world export,90
NA,prices should take a downturn. It faUs to,90
NA,nise the degree to which grain production is agriculture,90
NA,becoming more and more capital intensive. It,90
NA,faUs to recognise the necessity for the maintenvide,90
NA,ance of major agricultural industries in many of,90
NA,our outlying communities. Beyond aU that it still,90
NA,pursues a single commodity pohcy at a time represents,90
NA,"when many other countries-th e United States,",90
NA,for example-ar e considering not just one grain,90
NA,but providing an opportunity for farmers to,90
NA,move from one source of production to another,90
NA,according to the potential profitabiUty to the,90
NA,ducer of those crops and giving him the same,90
NA,protection.,90
NA,Let me advert for a moment to an aspect,90
NA,which it had been my intention to discuss with,90
NA,primary producers when we were in government.,90
NA,We were pursuing the idea of giving those who,90
NA,were in wheat production an opportunity to proare,90
NA,duce nulo or any other agricultural crop if,90
NA,crop were to produce for them a better result.,90
NA,wanted to see whether it was not possible to give,90
NA,them the same sort of guarantees as are provided,90
NA,"for them in the wheat agreement. For example,",90
NA,"many can produce oats, barley or milo. If one",90
NA,in a summer rainfaU area and there is a drought,90
NA,during the winter months it is far better,90
NA,duce milo than to leave the land faUow and,90
NA,duce no grain until the foUowing year.,90
NA,I refer those who might be interested in,90
NA,topic to a piece of legislation which the United,90
NA,States has on its statute book. It is pubhc,90
NA,93-86 of the 93rd Congress. It was passed on,90
NA,August 1973. It covers not just a wlieat program,90
NA,but a program relating to a range of agricultural,90
NA,industries. The aspect I refer to the House in relaindustry,90
NA,tion to this concern which I have with this,90
NA,lation is that it is designed to attract the farm,90
NA,duction needed to meet domestic and foreign,90
NA,demand for food andfibre.The United States,90
NA,legislation accomplishes this by creating a,90
NA,favourable climate within wliich farmers,90
NA,respond to market signals which indicate,90
NA,sumer demand and thus produce the crops which,90
NA,are needed at home and abroad. This Act protake place.,90
NA,vides a concept of guaranteed or target prices. It,90
NA,has deficiency payments for a range of commodiIt,90
NA,ties. The deficiency payments are to be related,90
NA,to an average market price. They are related to that,90
NA,average market price remaining above a target,90
NA,level. The Act provides a bonus for individual,90
NA,productivity greater than the overall national,90
NA,"In other words, it provides an op-",90
NA,It portunity for producer freedom and market,90
NA,orientated farm poUcy. To my mind this is a basis,90
NA,from which we in AustraUa might weU be able to,90
NA,encourage farm diversification which has been of,90
NA,recogsuch tremendous advantage to Australian,90
NA,in the last few years. This is a form by,90
NA,wbich this legislation could venture out and pro-,90
NA,more for the farmer than it does now.,90
NA,"In fact, this Wheat Industry StabUisation BUl",90
NA,the level of production which is avail-,90
NA,able to growers under former schemes. Not,90
NA,many Austrahans realise that a negotiated home,90
NA,consumption price for wheat under this legis-,90
NA,lation results in them getting farinaceous food,90
NA,"proproducts, such as bread, at much lower prices",90
NA,than the rest of the world's western industrial,90
NA,"communities. In other words, our wheat farmers",90
NA,are prepared to accept and are accepting a sig-,90
NA,nificantly lower price in order that they can get,90
NA,some stabUity in their income over a period.,90
NA,They are prejudicing the higher prices which,90
NA,they reserve by selling their wheat abroad. They,90
NA,doing this in order to enter into this agree-,90
NA,"that ment. Unfortunately, the Government has not",90
NA,We had the decency within the agreement to provide,90
NA,an offset by giving them a fair sort of return.,90
NA,"Rather, it has devised a scheme which ignores",90
NA,"the cost to the producer, ignores the inflationary",90
NA,is situation which the Government is inciting and,90
NA,ignores the circumstances of industrial disruption,90
NA,to prowhich has prevented the Australian Wheat,90
NA,proBoard and other grain marketing agencies from,90
NA,delivering grain and realising proceeds which,90
NA,otherwise would have been capable of being,90
NA,the paid to producers of grain delivered some years,90
NA,"ago. In other words, the wheat industry in a very",90
NA,law significant way is subsidising Austrahan con-,90
NA,10 sumers under this legislation. The Labor Party,90
NA,should recognise this when it talks about its hot,90
NA,air war against inflation. It should commend the,90
NA,for its restraint. This year the industry,90
NA,legismost probably wUl harvest a crop of less than,90
NA,pro400 milhon bushels. It probably wUl be less than,90
NA,"last year's crop. Harvesting this crop, transport-",90
NA,ing it to sUos and deUvering it from sUos in the,90
NA,"bush to major seaport terminals wUl not be easy,",90
NA,may particularly if this Government completely,90
NA,conneglects the provision of fuel supphes. One,90
NA,wonders whether the harvest wiU even be able to,90
NA,is quite tragic that this Government thinks it,90
NA,to can talk about wheat in one package and forget,90
NA,"all about the problems of harvesting wheat, hav-",91
NA,"ing fuel to harvest the wheat, having fuel ""to. en-",91
NA,able the rail trucks to get the wheat to the point,91
NA,of shipment and having men working when the,91
NA,wheat is dehvered to the port of shipment. All,91
NA,these things are breaking down and are creating,91
NA,a circumstance in which this wheat stabilisauon,91
NA,scheme could be completely frustrated. Har-,91
NA,"vesting this year's crop, transporting it to silos",91
NA,and shipping it could well be completely impos-,91
NA,sible under the farcical arrangements that this,91
NA,Government is pursuing with respect to fuel,91
NA,"supplies, particularly in northern New South",91
NA,Wales and Queensland.,91
Mr LUSHER ,Spar e parts.,91
Mr SINCLAIR,"Yes , getting spare parts",91
NA,agricultural machinery is another problem area.,91
NA,There are so many problem areas that the,91
NA,farmer will hnd it almost impossible to subsidise,91
NA,the Australian consumer as this legislation,91
NA,requires him to do. If this Government maintains,91
NA,its abrogation of its responsibilities for maintaintogether,91
NA,ing peaceful industrial relations there is Utde,91
NA,prospect for the future survival of the wheat,91
NA,industry.,91
NA,At the dockside level there is a ridiculous,91
NA,ation. The waterfront unions are refusing to,91
NA,handle ships under contract. They are dictating,91
NA,the nation's foreign affairs pohcies and refusing,91
NA,to load Greek flag vessels with wheat. Previous,91
NA,bans on Chilean ships have meant that the,91
NA,Wheat Board's shipping program is running,91
NA,"behind schedule, causing income iiow shortages",91
NA,to the wheat industry. These shortages resulted,91
NA,in the Wheat Board not being able to pay,91
NA,promised 20c per bushel on dehveries from last,91
NA,year's crop. The payment of that 20c per bushel,91
NA,would have meant a better Uquidity situation,91
NA,wheat growers and would have helped to reheve,91
NA,"the Uquidity position of the banks. Moreover,",91
NA,this occurred after an announcement by the,91
NA,Wheat Board last AprU setting out the dates on,91
NA,which funds would be avaUable as a result of,91
NA,sales that were made. It was known that ships,91
NA,were coming in. The only reason the payments motives.,91
NA,were not made is that this Government has not,91
NA,been bothered about getting the men to work,91
NA,and getting the cargo moving in the way a reation,91
NA,sponsible government would have done.,91
NA,There are other ways in which this Governplace,91
NA,"ment could have helped. If, in the last",91
NA,"had not been able to get the ships moving, get",91
NA,the grain moved and get the fuel so that the New,91
NA,South Wales RaUways were able to move the,91
NA,"grain from the internal granaries to the ports,",91
NA,could at least have considered the Rural Credits,91
NA,Department of the Reserve Bank and perhaps,91
NA,arranged to make a payment through it so that,91
NA,wheat growers could have received the 20c per,91
NA,"bushel that had been promised to them. Indeed,",91
NA,the borrowings from the Rural Credit Depart-,91
NA,ment were at their lowest level for several years.,91
NA,"The Board, of course, had exceUent prospects of",91
NA,"repaying the money within a very short time, but",91
NA,the Government was not prepared to come to the,91
NA,party. One of the amendments that I understand,91
NA,we are to consider later tonight is to enable tbis,91
NA,legislation to go through with an accelerated,91
NA,passage so that money can be borrowed,91
NA,commerciaUy. That might be a way around the,91
NA,"problem, but it is no answer in respect of the",91
NA,Government not having provided that which is,91
NA,for already avaUable- a loan through the Rural,91
NA,Credits Department of the Reserve Bank. The,91
NA,"wheat Minister for Northern Development, who",91
NA,represents the Minister for Agriculture in this,91
NA,"place, on many occasions, has argued the need",91
NA,"for rural credit. He was a party, I suspect,",91
NA,"with his coUeague, the Minister for",91
NA,"Agriculture, to a decision to deny credit which",91
NA,could have been easUy and properly repaid.,91
NA,There is another aspect of the BUl which is,91
NA,situeven more concerning. This Government sup-,91
NA,posedly is concerned with social justice-socia l,91
NA,justice to everybody other than the producers of,91
NA,this world. In the wheat industry it has preserved,91
NA,"one particular inequity, which is quite incredible.",91
NA,In the formulation of this scheme the Govern-,91
NA,well ment has decided that the cost of an owner-,91
NA,operator's allowance for labour should be that of,91
NA,a leading hand under the Pastoral Award of,91
NA,"a 1968. The award then was $3,181 per annum. It",91
NA,is now about 70 per cent higher than that. In,91
NA,"other words, the wheat growers of Austraha are",91
NA,for being caUed on to produce wheat and to subsi-,91
NA,"dise the Australian consumer, yet they are being",91
NA,forced to work at a labour cost imputed on the,91
NA,growing of that wheat at a wage rate which was,91
NA,relevant to the economic climate of 1968. If that,91
NA,"is social justice, goodness only knows how the",91
NA,Australian Labor Party interprets any of its,91
NA,There has been some suggestion that this situ-,91
NA,may be reviewed in 1975. I trust that the,91
NA,Minister for Northern Development who,91
NA,represents the Minister for Agriculture in this,91
NA,wUl give us an assurance that it will be,91
NA,"resort, it reviewed as soon as possible.",91
NA,Mr Fisher-H e is not even here.,91
Mr SINCLAIR,Correct ; he is not even in the,91
NA,it chamber. There is another question that con-,91
NA,cerns me. It is the question of mid-term,91
NA,"repayments. Under this scheme, all the growers'",92
NA,contributions to the stabilisauon fund are utilised,92
NA,before the Government is called on to make a,92
NA,"contribution. However, if a deficit builds up in ment.",92
NA,"terms of the Government's contributions,",92
NA,payments by the growers to the central funds,92
NA,must be paid to the Government. I find this most,92
NA,inequitable and against any principle of stabilisning,92
NA,"ation. Stabilisation is a two-way agreement,",92
NA,one-way agreement. The wheat industry has to,92
NA,"take its risks and the Government, if it is to",92
NA,"alistic in providing a stabilisation scheme, must",92
NA,also take its share of risks. The arrangement in,92
NA,relation to the mid-term repayments is against,92
NA,"the spirit of stabUisation. Of course, in the short",92
NA,"to medium term, the oudook for the Austrahan",92
NA,wheat industry on international markets is,92
NA,lent. The only factor limiting this oudook is,92
NA,domestic economic management of this nation.,92
NA,"Wheat growers, Uke all producers, are in the",92
NA,"hands of inflation. Rising production costs, shortco-operation",92
NA,"ages and so on, caused to a large degree by this",92
NA,Government's faUure to restrain innation,92
NA,"tolerable level, are adversely affecting the pro-",92
NA,fitability of the wheat industry. In many,92
NA,"rural industries, many producers are operating",92
NA,negative profitabUity because of the rigours,92
NA,inflation. Although the consumer price index,92
NA,"dicates an inflation level of 16.4 per cent, it",92
NA,considerably higher in many agricultural indus Mr,92
NA,"tries. For example, the assessment ofthe Bureau",92
NA,of Agricultural Economics produced before the,92
NA,Prices Justification Tribunal inquiry into the,92
NA,dairy industry was 24 per cent a year cost,92
NA,"tion. In the wheat industry, it is considerably",92
NA,higher.,92
NA,The Opposition is concerned with the imphcaAustralia,92
NA,tions of this BUl. It accepts that it is necessary,92
NA,it is horrified at the manner in which it was,92
NA,tiated and beUeves that it is necessary that,92
NA,House take note of the Opposition's amendment.,92
NA,"Therefore, I move:",92

NA,for 2 seasons beyond the duration of the stabUis-,92

NA,marketing. Negotiations on the new scheme,92
NA,"were conducted by the Minister for Agriculture,",92
NA,"Senator Wriedt, with the executive of the Aus-",92
NA,exceltrahan Wheat Growers Federation. Unlike the,92
NA,the previous speaker the honourable member for,92
NA,"New England ( Mr Sinclair), I state that these",92
NA,negotiations were conducted in an atmosphere of,92
NA,and in a genuine attempt to arrive,92
NA,at a solution to a problem which has beset the,92
NA,at a wheat industry for many years.,92
NA,other When the negotiations were concluded suc-,92
NA,"at cessfuUy with the Federation on 8 March, the",92
NA,of President of the Australian Wheat Growers Fed-,92
NA,"ineration, Mr Max Ridd, stated publicly that he",92
NA,is was satisfied with the results of the negotiations.,92
NA,"Max Ridd, as we have heard here this even-",92
NA,"ing, was supposed to under some sort of duress.",92
NA,"Certainly, he would not have been restrained in",92
NA,his comments if that had in fact been the case.,92
NA,inflaThe delays that were caused on that occasion,92
NA,were due purely and simply to the pig-headed-,92
NA,ness of Liberal and Country Party State govern-,92
NA,ments. The State Labor Government of Western,92
NA,had accepted the proposals. At the sub-,92
NA,"butsequent State election, a new Liberal Govern-",92
NA,negoment was elected. That Government rejected the,92
NA,"the scheme. But, of course, that Government could",92
NA,not be outdone by the greatest obstructionist in,92
NA,"the Australian States, Sir Robert Askin, who",92
NA,view to went to the polls and was elected on a mandate,92
NA,to obstruct any action by the Federal Govern-,92
NA,"House ment, regardless of whether it was beneficial. Sir",92
NA,of disRobert Askin stepped in and reneged on those,92
NA,and arrangements. His Goverment reneged on the,92
NA,commitments that it had given to the wheat,92
NA,of industrial disruption be-,92
NA,"Governindustry. What is more, these actions by the State",92
NA,to enable Governments of Western Australia and of New,92
NA,crop to be South Wales were condemned at thetimeby the,92
NA,wheat industry. It was this sort of obstructionism,92
NA,led to the major delay in the initiation of this,92
NA,OpThe scheme itself is a determined and almost,92
NA,amendunique attempt to overcome a problem which,92
NA,was inherent in the previous schemes. This was,92
NA,the confrontation between the prices and costs of,93
NA,"production of wheat on the one hand and, on the",93
NA,"other hand, world prices which had no rela-",93
NA,tionship or relativity at all to the costs of pro-,93
NA,duction in Austraha. These 2 conflicting issues,93
NA,have been resolved for the first time in what is,93
NA,indeed a unique scheme. The variations in wheat,93
NA,prices on the international market are a fact of,93
NA,"hfe and so, too, is the escalation in costs of",93
NA,duction.,93
NA,We had all sorts of convolutions taking place,93
NA,under the previous Government. The wheat,93
NA,industry does not need to be reminded ofthe se-,93
NA,quence of events leading up to the end of 1969,93
NA,when the previous Liberal-Country Party,93
NA,Government in a quite summary way imposed,93
NA,quotas on the wheat industry at a time when,93
NA,many of the wheat growers had wheat in the,93
NA,ground. It is far better to give the wheat industry,93
NA,some sort of notice of what income its producers,93
NA,are likely to receive many years ahead and to,93
NA,cushion the income of wheat growers against the,93
NA,shocks of the international market. That is in fact,93
NA,what this scheme achieves. That is far better than,93
NA,a pohcy of imposing quotas in a mandatory way,93
NA,out of the blue on wheat growers when they have,93
NA,"their seed in the ground, as happened under the",93
NA,previous Liberal-Country Party Government in,93
NA,1969.,93
NA,Thefirstelement of this scheme is afixeddom-,93
NA,estic price for wheat to be adjusted annually,93
NA,from the level ofthe 1973-74 season and to be,93
NA,carried out by index methods through the Ufe of,93
NA,the scheme. The second element is a stabilisation,93
NA,price covering all export wheat. Under the pre-,93
NA,"vious scheme, the guaranteed price covered only",93
NA,200 milhon bushels. That was another of the,93
NA,limitations built into the scheme under the,93
NA,Liberal-Country Party Government. The present,93
NA,scheme covers all export wheat. This is clearly a,93
NA,major revolution in the protection of the wheat,93
NA,industry. In common with the Australian,93
NA,Wheatgrowers Federation's proposals submitted,93
NA,"to the Government last September, the major",93
NA,objective of the scheme is to give the wheat,93
NA,industry some security against price fluctuations,93
NA,without distorting the underlying trend in market,93
NA,prices and to keep the cost to the Austrahan pub-,93
NA,Uc within definite hmits. The proposals from the,93
NA,AustraUan Wheatgrowers Federation have been,93
NA,accepted in this new and unique scheme which,93
NA,moderates the impact of fluctuating prices on the,93
NA,international market.,93
NA,The scheme continues the orderly marketing,93
NA,arrangements through the Australian Wheat,93
NA,Board which the industry has enjoyed since the,93
NA,first post-war stabUisation scheme commenced,93
NA,under a Labor Government in 1948. Once again,93
NA,we see a Labor Government introducing the first,93
NA,major innovation for the protection of the wheat,93
NA,industry against fluctuating incomes. The ar-,93
NA,rangements under which the Government,93
NA,guarantees borrowings from the Reserve Bank,93
NA,by the Australian Wheat Board wUl continue.,93
NA,These arrangements have enabled the Board to,93
NA,pro- maintain the first advance payment over the,93
NA,years even when average returns have fallen to,93
NA,lower levels. With reference tofirstadvance pay-,93
NA,"ments, immediately on taking office, this",93
NA,Government agreed to demands which had been,93
NA,"refused by the previous speaker in this debate,",93
NA,"the honourable member for New England, who",93
NA,was then Minister for Primary Industry. Those,93
NA,demands were to increase the first advance pay-,93
NA,ment by 10c to $1.20 a bushel. This action must,93
NA,be contrasted in the wheat grower's mind with,93
NA,the attitude of the honourable member for New,93
NA,"England when, in October 1972, as Minister for",93
NA,"Primary Industry, he pointblank refused to",93
NA,increase thefirstadvance payment by 10c.,93
NA,Mr MCVeigh-Yo u put the interest rate up by,93
NA,6 per cent.,93
Mr WHAN,W e have now struck the chord.,93
NA,We hear the Country Party-,93
NA,Mr MCVeigh-What rubbish.,93
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The Deputy Leader,93
NA,of the Country Party was heard in comparative,93
NA,sUence.,93
NA,Mr MCVeigh-He told the truth.,93
Mr SPEAKER,Order! The honourable,93
NA,member for Darling Downs wUl remain sUent. I,93
NA,wiU insist that the honourable member for Eden-,93
NA,Monaro receive the same courtesy as did the,93
NA,Deputy Leader of the Country Party whUe he,93
NA,makes his contribution.,93
Mr WHAN," Mr Speaker, I thank you for your",93
NA,protection from the kindergarten behaviour on,93
NA,myright.The reaction was due simply to 2 unde-,93
NA,niable facts: On taking office this Government,93
NA,"raised the lint advance by 10c a bushel, while in",93
NA,October 1972 the Liberal-Country Party,93
NA,"Government, in which the honourable member",93
NA,for New England was the Minister for Primary,93
NA,"Industry, refused point blank to do this. There is",93
NA,no argument about that. That is a statement of,93
NA,the position as it existed and as it was known by,93
NA,every wheat grower in the industry. The stabUi-,93
NA,sation price for the year 1974-75 wUl be set at $2,93
NA,a bushel-considerabl y more than the guaran-,93
NA,teed $1.60 a bushel which apphed in 1973-74.,93
NA,The stabUisation price will be adjusted in each of,93
NA,the succeeding 4 years by the application of the,93
NA,formula which was agreed to by the industry,94
NA,the Government. The formula will move stabiliEngland,94
NA,sation prices in line with market trends and,94
NA,particular will cushion sharp declines in overseas,94
NA,"market values. This, of course, is one of",94
NA,"unique features of this scheme, this shock",94
NA,absorber system which has been built into it.,94
NA,With grower returns linked more closely to theprices,94
NA,market place a more economic allocation of,94
NA,resources will be encouraged within the wheat,94
NA,"industry and the rural sector generally,",94
NA,go a long way towards providing that flexibility,94
NA,that the honourable member for New England,94
NA,appealed for in terms of alternative uses,94
NA,farm. Under past schemes there,94
NA,guaranteed price which moved in line with,94
NA,changes in assessed costs of production. This,94
NA,posal is a major revolution in the protection,94
NA,wheat growers' incomes against fluctuating,94
NA,prices. The honourable member for New,94
NA,England said that the present agreement ignores,94
NA,the costs of production and gives reduced protec-Government,94
NA,tion to growers. Let me quote from a speech,94
NA,made in this House on 10 October 1968 by the,94
NA,present Leader of the Country Party ( Mr designed,94
NA,Anthony). In that speech he said that the simand,94
NA,plest explanation for the need for change in,94
NA,"cost formula- I refer here to the cost of prowool,",94
NA,duction index-wa s that in IS consecutive,94
NA,average returns to growers had been less,94
NA,"the assessed cost of production, yet the industry",94
NA,had expanded at an unprecedented rate. He thenstUl,94
NA,said:,94
NA,It is demonstrably prosperous. There can be no doubt,94
NA,the returns from wheat marketed have been remunerative.,94
NA,This was the present Leader ofthe Country Partymdustry,94
NA,saying that the cost of production index had been,94
NA,obviously out of kilter with the facts of Ufe.,94
NA,here we have the sort of criticism that he,94
NA,then answering being leveUed at the Governcommitments,94
NA,ment by the honourable member for New,94
NA,"England. In the 1973-74 season, as I have",94
NA,"tioned already, the Government raised the first",94
NA,advance by 10c a bushel. It was a clear responseavaUable,94
NA,from a concerned Government to the conditions,94
NA,that existed in the wheat industry and a responseto,94
NA,to the need that existed in the wheat industry,94
NA,that time.,94
NA,There can be no question that this Governcate,94
NA,ment has done more for the agricultural sector,94
NA,than any government in the last 23 years. In,94
NA,"fell swoop it has given to the agricultural sector,as",94
NA,including wheat growers many of whom run the,94
NA,"sheep, afixedreserve price. Look at the saga",94
NA,existed on the Opposition benches over that,94
NA,issue. The scheme was bankroUed by SISOm of,94
NA,Government monev. I return to another point,94
NA,andmade by the honourable member for New,94
NA,( Mr Sinclair). He complained that,94
NA,in wheat harvesting in New South Wales and in,94
NA,Austraha generaUy wUl be curtaUed by fuel,94
NA,the shortages. Imagine what would have happened,94
NA,if by some disaster he and his colleagues had,94
NA,been elected to government. Those wheat,94
NA,farmers would now be paying extraordinary,94
NA,"for the petrol used in harvesting, simply",94
NA,because the oU companies of the world had them,94
NA,and it willunder their thumbs.,94
NA,(Opposition members interjecting)-,94
Mr SPEAKER,Order! I warn the honourable,94
NA,existed a member for Darling Downs.,94
Mr WHAN,Thi s new scheme for stabUising,94
NA,prowheat prices represents a major step forward in,94
NA,of the protection of wheat producers against,94
NA,fluctuating incomes. It cushions them from the,94
NA,sudden shocks such as the one brought about,94
NA,when quotas were introduced under the previous,94
NA,at the end of 1969. It cushions the,94
NA,wheat growers against this very disastrous,94
NA,change in expectations. This scheme has been,94
NA,in consultation with the wheat industry,94
NA,one of the things that the Country Party can-,94
NA,thenot accept is that industries such as wheat and,94
NA,"and other industries, are now prepared to",94
NA,years consult and work in co-operation with this,94
NA,than Government. Honourable members opposite,94
NA,still think they have a mandate to govern. They,94
NA,think that they are the only ones who have a,94
NA,right to be addressed by the agricultural sector.,94
NA,thatThe fact is that this scheme has been worked out,94
NA,in consultation and co-operation with the wheat,94
NA,try Party.,94
NA,and this sticks in the throat of the Coun-,94
NA,Yet This scheme embodies in it all sorts of commit-,94

NA,"indicated, wUl be embodied in this BUl by an",94

NA,the agricultural people are forced to hear from,94
NA,"Country Party, having no confidence at all in",94
NA,"thattheir judgment, having some sort of desire to",94
NA,take over these operations in some centralised,94

Mr HYDE ,Moore) (8.43)-Before dealing,95
NA,"with the matters I intended to speak on, I want",95
NA,deal with an extraordinary statement by the,95
NA,"vious speaker, the member for Eden Monaro",95
NA,"( Mr Whan), a man whose training",95
NA,should provide him with knowledge enough to,95
NA,know better.,95
Mr JAMES ,He spoke above your head.,95
Mr HYDE,H e did not speak above my head.inquiry,95
NA,He spoke of the increase of 10c a bushel in,95
NA,"first advance price on wheat. That 10c a bushel,The",95
NA,"move from $1.10 to $1.20, is a far lower proindustry",95
NA,"portion ofthe moneys coming in when comparedket,",95
NA,to the export price of the day; compared to worlddeflationary,95
NA,prices it is far lower; compared to the stabilised,95
NA,"price it is far lower. In real terms it is,",95
NA,far lower. It isridiculousto refer to that as a real,95
NA,rise. It is a fall.,95
Mr DUTHIE ,The y never got it under your,95
NA,Government.,95
Mr HYDE, I still make the point that under,95
NA,our Government a far higher proportion of,95
NA,money received was paid as the first advance. Itquite,95
NA,is not the wish ofthe Opposition to delay this,95
NA,It should not be delayed at this time. But,95
NA,does not mean that we are happy with it. We are,95
NA,most unhappy with it. The industry does not wishbut,95
NA,to see it delayed. That does not mean that,95
NA,industry is happy with it. The industry is most,95
NA,happy with it. We have seen a radical change,95
NA,principles. Let me quote from the second readingproducers.,95
NA,speech of the Minister for Northern Develop-,95
NA,ment (Dr Patterson) who represents the Minister,95
NA,"for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt). Incidentally,",95
NA,he has not bothered to remain to hear the debate.,95
NA,He said:,95
NA,. . . the Oovernment concluded that there should,95
NA,major revision of the existing stabilisation arrangements.,95
NA,"particular, we-",95
NA,"that is, the Government-",95
NA,reached the position that the provision of a guaranteed,95
NA,"for a specific quantity of exports, with the price",95
NA,adjusted according to certain cost movements from year to,95
NA,"year, was not conducive to maximum efficiency in the wheat",95
NA,industry.,95
NA,That may be so. He also said that these the,95
NA,proposals-,95
NA,are to give the industry some security against price,95
NA,tion without distorting the underlying trend in market,95
NA,The proposed scheme distorts the underlying,95
NA,trend in market prices and gives very Uttle,95
NA,tection against price downturns. This industry,95
NA,produces its product in an environment where,95
NA,are boosted by the tariff waU and by indus-,95
NA,"poUcies of the Govemment, and are abetted",95
NA,"by the Government. It has been argued, and",95
NA,"reasonably argued, in the past that a high home",95
NA,"toconsumption price-tha t is, high in reladon to the",95
NA,pre-world price with tariff compensation-wa s the,95
NA,thing that brought the market forces back into,95
NA,I thought balance and back into play.,95
NA,"Incidentally, were theretimeto refer the mat-",95
NA,ter to the Industries Assistance Commission-ob -,95
NA,viously there is not- I wouldfindit very hard to,95
NA,beUeve that the industry could suffer from any,95

NA,sound if the industry were offered anytliing,95
NA,"Bill.reasonable, but it is offered nothing in return.",95
NA,that The home consumption price should not move,95
NA,"up and down with every shift in market forces,",95
NA,it should reflect likely long term trends and in,95
NA,the adverse times it should cushion violent down-,95
NA,un-turns in the market that would disrupt the indus-,95

NA,The home consumption price is to be adjusted,95
NA,by annual reference to costs except that the al-,95
NA,"lowance for the grower's return-hi s basic wage,",95
NA,as it were-i s fixed according to 1968 values. In,95
NA,these times of spiralling wages and prices why,95
NA,be asingle out wheat growers to stand still in money,95
NA,Interms and to fall back very rapidly in real terms?,95
NA,There is currendy around 86 mUlion bushels of,95
NA,wheat used within Australia. Exports should,95
NA,priceyield in excess of $2.73 a bushel with a prob-,95
NA,being abUity of $3 a bushel. The 86 million bushels,95
NA,sold to the home market at 75c less than export,95
NA,E rices represents an annual contribution to the,95
NA,ome market of $64m or $320m over the life of,95
NA,agreement. For anyone to argue that escalat-,95
NA,ing costs wUl force up the home consumption,95
NA,fluctua-price as we live with inflation and so reduce the,95
NA,prices.margin between the home consumption price,95
NA,"and the export price, is to say that this Govem-",95
NA,proment is going to allow a situation in which our,95
NA,rate of inflation wUl inevitably be higher than,95
NA,"that of our trading partners. Heaven help us, for",95
NA,that will destroy the export market. In return for,96
NA,this contribution the Australian wheatgrower is,96
NA,offered stabilisation-o r equalisation-bu t at,96
NA,what level?,96
NA,In the event of a drastic slump the growers',96
NA,price is to be stabilized from a fund of $80m to,96
NA,which he himself has been contributing. How,96
NA,much will he have been contributing? The,96
NA,growers will have contributed $48m now and in,96
NA,"all probability, the whole $80m-wit h nearly the",96
NA,remainder going in this season. We can forecast,96
NA,with reasonable expectation that prices will be,96
NA,more than 1 Sc above the stabilization price for at,96
NA,least the first 2 years. Every contribution of the,96
NA,Government to this fund will be repaid in the,96
NA,event of grower contributions later placing,96
NA,"moneys back into the fund. So, it is almost",96
NA,impossible to envisage a situation where the,96
NA,Government would be involved in any loss what-,96
NA,"soever. Nevertheless, let us consider the most",96
NA,costly but still unlikely posiuon in which the,96
NA,"Government might find itself. That is, growers",96
NA,contribute-a s they certainly will-$48 m in the,96
NA,first year and $30m in the next year and the,96
NA,remaining $2m in the third year. I f the wheat,96
NA,market collapses completely the Government,96
NA,pays out $30m in each of the remaining 3,96
NA,years-i n the most unhkely event of a prolonged,96
NA,and unpredicted slump. Even in those conditions,96
NA,the Government would have to find a mere,96
NA,$10m. The export price would need to fall to,96
NA,most unlikely low levels for the home consump-,96
NA,tion price to return the $128m subsidy that the,96
NA,wheatgrower is providing to the home market in,96
NA,"the first 2 years. In fact, the Government is using",96
NA,the wheat industry in an anti-inflationary policy,96
NA,and offering it nothing in return.,96
NA,Let me come to the accusations of obstruction,96
NA,by the State governments. Let us look at the pos-,96
NA,ition in Western Austraha in particular and at,96
NA,why the Court Government was so reluctant to,96
NA,"accept these provisions. First of all, in Western",96
NA,Australia we have produced 29 per cent of the,96
NA,wheat and we have 22 per cent of the quota. We,96
NA,have no great incentive to stay with this scheme.,96
NA,We have the greatest potential to expand our,96
NA,wheat production and to bring further land,96
NA,"under wheat. Yet, the quota was frozen. We have",96
NA,a freight advantage that has never been ad-,96
NA,equately recognised. We have no border over,96
NA,which we can trans-ship wheat and so avoid the,96
NA,provisions of the quota and the restrictions,96
NA,imposed. If honourable members consider that is,96
NA,a small matter I ask them to consider that when,96
NA,world prices rose and it no longer paid to sell,96
NA,wheat outside the system wheat for home con-,96
NA,sumption purchased from the Board jumped by,96
NA,26 million bushels. A lot of wheat was being sold,96
NA,outside the system. Western Austraha was not in,96
NA,that. There was no opportunity. Not that I be-,96
NA,lieve that any grower ought to have been in it.,96
NA,Because Western Austraha has a low home,96
NA,"consumption and a high export, when we are",96
NA,faced with an inequitable scheme such as this-,96
NA,inequitable between the consumers and the pro-,96
NA,"ducers Australia, perforce, makes a much greater",96
NA,contribution to the inequity. Western Australia,96
NA,had every reason to be very chary about this,96
NA,"wheat scheme, and hence the stand of the Court",96
NA,Government.,96
NA,I wish to say something about wheat quality,96
NA,and payment for quality. For too long the indus-,96
NA,try has been offered nofinancialincentive to pro-,96
NA,duce quality wheat. It is too often confused with,96
NA,the argument of segregation and the admitted,96
NA,difficulties of segregating a vast number of wheat,96
NA,varieties. It is sufficient that the wheat growers be,96
NA,"paid for producing quality, and all that is necess-",96
NA,ary to conduct the machinery of this exercise is,96
NA,that sufficient sampling be done so that each,96
NA,grower can be rewarded for producing some-,96
NA,thing better than the minimum standards-stan -,96
NA,"dards, incidentally, that have to be set so that",96
NA,most growers can meet them. If we again go into,96
NA,times when wheat is difficult to sell we will regret,96
NA,not having done our level best to produce the,96
NA,"best wheat within Australia. Finally, I summarise",96
NA,my remarks about the scheme itself. Growers,96
NA,contribute much-$64 m a year-an d they get,96
NA,little. In all probability they will get nothing.,96
NA,Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (9.1)- I was,96
NA,very surprised to hear the Deputy Leader of the,96
NA,"Country Party, the honourable member for New",96
NA,"England ( Mr Sinclair), blame the Government",96
NA,for the delay in the introduction of these wheat,96
NA,Bills. The Opposition seems to have a great ca-,96
NA,pacity to cause delay and to blame it on the,96
NA,Government. The delay in the introduction of,96
NA,these Bills was caused by the Senate's refusing to,96
NA,introduce measures that were approved by the,96
NA,people at the May elections. Not only did the,96
NA,Senate refuse to endorse the measures; it even,96
NA,went as far as going into court in an effort to pre-,96
NA,vent the Government from holding the Joint Sit-,96
NA,ting of the Parliament. It is a lot of rot to say that,96
NA,the Government is holding up its own legislation.,96
NA,I do not think any of the electors will be fooled,96
NA,by this type of propaganda. The honourable,96
NA,member for New England was critical of the fact,96
NA,that there has been some delay in the export of,96
NA,wheat because of an industrial dispute. Does he,96
NA,forget that there was an even longer delay when,96
NA,the Opposition was in government? At that time,96
NA,we had no overseas markets to supply. It was not,97
NA,until this Government went out and obtained,97
NA,markets that we had any opportunity to export,97
NA,wheat.,97
NA,The honourable member for Moore ( Mr,97
NA,Hyde) has mentioned the Tariff Board. It seems,97
NA,to be a strange thing that the Opposition parties,97
NA,want to remind the people of what happened,97
NA,with tariffs during the 23 years that they were in,97
NA,government. The wheat growers were concerned,97
NA,about tariffs. They asked our predecessors to,97
NA,"remove them, but it was not until the Labor",97
NA,Party came into power that there was a 25 per,97
NA,cent reduction in tariffs.,97
NA,I support the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill,97
NA,"because I beheve that, together with the Wheat",97
NA,Products Export Adjustment Bill and the Wheat,97
NA,"Export Charge Bill, it will introduce a stabUis-",97
NA,ation plan in respect of the 5 growing seasons,97
NA,starting on 1 October 1974.1 believe tiiat this is,97
NA,very desirable proposition. It wUl remove much,97
NA,of the uncertainty in the minds of wheat growers,97
NA,and wUl aUow them to plan their production over,97
NA,a long period. This will result in better planning,97
NA,and therefore a greater nnanciai return to the,97
NA,industry. These measures should meet with the,97
NA,approval of the industry. When introducing,97
NA,these BUls the Minister for Northern Develop-,97
NA,ment (Dr Patterson) told us that they had been,97
NA,accepted by the industry organisations. So they,97
NA,"should be, because their basic aim is to bring",97
NA,security against price fluctuations. The legis-,97
NA,lation sets out to do this without any undue inter-,97
NA,ference with market prices. I want to point out,97
NA,here that I do not intend the inference to be,97
NA,taken that there should never be any interference,97
NA,with market prices. I am reminded of what hap-,97
NA,pened with the wool markets. If there had not,97
NA,been some interference with those markets many,97
NA,wool growers would be out of production today.,97
NA,I do not think that interference is quite as necessunder,97
NA,ary in regard to wheat because the AustraUan,97
NA,Wheat Board is the sole marketing authority and,97
NA,has control over aU wheat marketed in AustraUa,97
NA,as well as the wheat and wheat products,97
NA,exported from AustraUa.,97
NA,I agree with the provision that the Australian,97
NA,Wheat Board is to have power for two seasons,97
NA,beyond the duration of this stabUisation scheme,97
NA,because to grow and market wheat is no small,97
NA,"operation. Big things, of necessity, should gain",97
NA,"momentum slowly and, of course, they should be",97
NA,run down slowly. These measures bring in a,97
NA,stabUisation on price related to movement in the,97
NA,international wheat market. I am in favour of,97
NA,this because I beheve that no responsible governThe,97
NA,ment should introduce a scheme which is not,97
NA,related to either the requirements of an inter-,97
NA,national market or to home consumption. If this,97
NA,were not so our valuable resources could be,97
NA,"wasted and excess wheat could be produced,",97
NA,although I am prepared to admit that this is,97
NA,highly unlikely in the foreseeable future.,97
NA,This scheme provides for abandonment of the,97
NA,concept of a guaranteed price and replaces it,97
NA,with a stabUisation price related to movements in,97
NA,the international wheat market. The grower wUl,97
NA,know in advance what his return wUl be and wUl,97
NA,know that it wUl not be below a certainfigure.As,97
NA,"a matter of fact, the 1974-75 price wUl be $73.49",97
NA,"per tonne f.o.b., or, as stated already, $2 per",97
NA,bushel. This is an advance on the present legis-,97
NA,lation because it does not contain this provision.,97
NA,"It appUes, of course, to aU wheat exported.",97
NA,Honourable members should compare this,97
NA,scheme with the present legislation and the dried,97
NA,a vine fruits stabilisation legislation. The scheme,97
NA,for dried vine fruits contained a tonnage limi-,97
NA,tation but no Umitation appUed to new plantings,97
NA,and this forced many growers off their land.,97
NA,This wheat stabUisation scheme wiU provide,97
NA,security not only for those directly involved in,97
NA,growing wheat but also for those indirecdy in-,97
NA,volved. It is only just that in a time of buoyant,97
NA,prices the industry should make some contribu-,97
NA,tion to the cost of the scheme. Regardless of this,97
NA,the Government is guaranteeing the scheme to,97
NA,the extent of $80m over 5 years. Any government,97
NA,contribution not recouped before the end of the 5,97
NA,year period wiU be written off. The Minister has,97
NA,explained already that this provision is not con-,97
NA,tained in the BUl but he mentioned it in this,97
NA,House for the record. In addition the grower is to,97
NA,pay no contribution if the average export price is,97
NA,"below $55.12 per tonne, or $1.50 per bushel, and",97
NA,he wUl receive a contribution from the fund,97
NA,the formula set out in clause 29 (5) of the,97
NA,"BUl. Also, he wUl receive a distribution when the",97
NA,fund is in credit in excess of $80m. The inclusion,97
NA,of clauses 21 (6) and 23 (1) (b) wUl close a lot of,97
NA,loopholes that exist in the present legislation. All,97
NA,honourable members remember the period,97
NA,when we had the across-the-border black market,97
NA,in wheat. Today we heard a lot about slush funds,97
NA,of the deep sea saUors. I am not saying that the,97
NA,same thing applies in regard to black marketing,97
NA,"in over-the-border wheat, but I point out that a",97
NA,lot of this black marketing was going on and it,97
NA,put many wheat growers off the land. The pre-,97
NA,vious Government was in a position to do some-,97
NA,thing about it but faUed to do it.,97
NA,provision to include 10 growers' represen-,97
NA,tatives on the Board has been retained. I believe,97
NA,that is to the credit of the Government. The legis-,98
NA,lation is being amended to give one home con-,98
NA,sumption price. I believe that here again another,98
NA,loophole in the present legislation has been,98
NA,"blocked off, because there is no doubt that non-",98
NA,human consumption wheat has been finding its,98
NA,way into markets to which it should not have,98
NA,found its way. Having a good general standard,98
NA,of wheat throughout is a much better idea.,98
NA,I hope that the Opposition will not delay the,98
NA,"passing of these Bills, because already there are",98
NA,restrictions on expanding the world food than 50 per cent.,98
NA,suppUes. The traditional approach to increasing,98
NA,production by expanding the area under culti-,98
NA,vation can no longer apply or has hmited scope,98
NA,for the future. This is because densely populated,98
NA,countries like Japan and the countries of western,98
NA,Europe no longer have land avaUable for,98
NA,"production. Added to this, most of the rivers",98
NA,lend themselves to damming and irrigation,98
NA,already been developed. We have yet to learn,98
NA,what impact the energy crisis wUl have on,98
NA,production. It could well mean that energy,98
NA,may cause farmers engaged in high energy conquotas.,98
NA,"suming agriculture, such as that in practice",98
NA,"Umted States of America, to hold down pronot",98
NA,duction. I beheve we have a duty to create a glo-,98
NA,bal food reserve to provide a measure of world,98
NA,price stabUity. I think that in the long run this,98
NA,be in the self interest of all nations. I commend,98
NA,the BUls to the House.,98
Mr KING ,Wimmera) (9.13)-Being a very,98
NA,"charitable type, I commence my remarks by sayin",98
NA,ing that the 2 Government speakers this evening,98
NA,made the very best with very poor material.,98
NA,honourable member for Darling ( Mr prices,98
NA,FitzPatrick) commenced his speech by claiming,98
NA,great credit for securing export sales of wheat.,98
NA,Mr FitzPatrick-We did.,98
Mr KING,H e went very close to it. He,98
NA,ticised the previous government,98
NA,"not find markets overseas, but today we have",98
NA,"them. Therefore, if that is not claiming credit I do",98
NA,not know what is. But the honourable member,98
NA,not prepared to teU us about the lack of demand,98
NA,today for wool and meat. If he is to take credit,98
NA,"one issue, please let him take what goes with",98
NA,other. The honourable member for Edenthan,98
NA,Monaro ( Mr Whan) gave us a very interesting,98
NA,address too. He talked about the many things,98
NA,the wheat stabUisation scheme of which he was,98
NA,proud. He said he was proud of the fact that,98
NA,would cover aU the wheat that was grown,98
NA,"AustraUa, but he did not say by how much.",98
NA,talked about this legislation as a major innovawithin,98
NA,"tion. He talked about thefirstadvance on wheat,",98
NA,but he did not teU us what sort of interest rates,98
NA,the wheat mdustry pays today. He did not,98
NA,remind us of the percentage that the present,98
NA,"Government is paying on the first advance, as",98
NA,the honourable member for Moore ( Mr Hyde),98
NA,reminded him of the percentage being paid,98
NA,under this scheme as compared with what was,98
NA,paid by the previous Government. The previous,98
NA,Government paid a first advance averaged over,98
NA,"5 years, of more than 80 per cent of the final pay-",98
NA,ment to wheat growers. In the first year of this,98
NA,new plan the first advance is expected to be less,98
NA,Mr MCVeigh-Onl y 50 per cent?,98
Mr KING,Only 50 per cent. The honourable,98
NA,member for Eden-Monaro made great play,98
NA,crop about the satisfaction of the Australian,98
NA,that Wheatgrowers Federation with this plan. The,98
NA,have Deputy Leader of the Country Party ( Mr,98
NA,Sinclair) made it very clear that the Federation,98
NA,food accepted the plan rather reluctantly. The,98
NA,cost honourable member for Eden-Monaro criticised,98
NA,This again is the suggestion of the Aus-,98
NA,in the tralian Wheatgrowers Federation. Why did he,98
NA,"praise the Federation on that point, too ?",98
NA,The difference between this plan and the pre-,98
NA,"vious plan, on the surface, appears insignificant;",98
NA,wUl but on a close scrutiny one wUl find a very big,98
NA,difference. It removes the guaranteed price and,98
NA,substitutes what I caU a cushioning price. The,98
NA,returns to growers wUl tend to follow the market,98
NA,both up and down. When the market is down we,98
NA,this Party are very concerned on behalf of the,98
NA,wheat industry. The issues in this BUl appear,98
NA,"The minor today, but when times are tough and",98
NA,are low these minor items could well be,98
NA,major issues which would have adverse effects on,98
NA,the return to growers. The reason I say this is,98
NA,simply that at present the reduced quantity of,98
NA,wheat throughot the world has tended to lift the,98
NA,criprice considerably. Government members take,98
NA,because it could credit for this fact.,98
NA,If one compares this increased price and the,98
NA,is general cost of production today with the pos-,98
NA,"ition some years ago, one wUl agree that at",98
NA,on present the price is not excessive. I ask: What,98
NA,the article can be purchased today for afigureless,98
NA,double that of a few years ago? I f it were,98
NA,"just profitable 10 or 15 years ago, my guess is",98
NA,in that it is no more profitable today. The only,98
NA,advantage is that wheat growers have increased,98
NA,it their productivity more than have the growers in,98
NA,in any other industry of which I know. Previous,98
NA,He plans had a Umited amount of wheat which came,98
NA,"the export guarantee, but the amount of",98
NA,the guarantee per bushel was unhmited. It was,98
NA,"limited in quantity, but the finance was unlimi-",99
NA,ted. Today in this proposal the quantity is unUmi-,99
NA,ted but the amount of money is restricted. The,99
NA,postion is the reverse. Yet the Government is,99
NA,proud of this position. It means that there is a,99
NA,maximum of $30m a year. If $30m is spread over,99
NA,"a crop for sale of $300m, it is only 10c a bushel,",99
NA,whereas previously the quantity was Umited to,99
NA,"200 milhon bushels. But it could, if the price feU",99
NA,"to a low level, mean even so much more in total",99
NA,as weU as in the amount per bushel. For the,99
NA,1967-68 pool the then Government paid out,99
NA,"$42,869,000, and in respect ofthe year 1971-72",99
NA,"it paid out $40,131,000. I point out, however,",99
NA,that it is not the totalfigurethat is so imponant,99
NA,but the guarantee in the event ofthe price falling,99
NA,"below a reasonablefigure.To my mind, that is",99
NA,the most imponant point to remember in relation,99
NA,to any plan.,99
NA,"It is obvious that this plan, spread over 5 years,",99
NA,"wUl be successful because,firstof all, the growers",99
NA,"have contributed $48m up to this time, before",99
NA,the actual scheme commences. There is $48m in,99
NA,the fund now. Because of the present ruling price,99
NA,it is expected that they wUl contribute a maxi-,99
NA,"mum of $30m this year. It is hardly Ukely, be-",99
NA,cause of the present world shortage and the fact,99
NA,that the surplus accounts for only 22 million tons,99
NA,as compared with approximately SO million tons,99
NA,"average over the last 10 years, that the price of",99
NA,the next harvest wiU fall below the minimum,99
NA,price at which growers are required to contribute.,99
NA,In theory the growers will have in the fund,99
NA,"$78m, or maybe $80m. Under Part IV, clauses",99
NA,"30, sub-clause (S), the amount to be paid out in",99
NA,any one year is Umited to $30m. That being the,99
NA,"case, irrespective of what the price may be that",99
NA,$80m must faU short by only $10m to cover,99
NA,growers for the remaining 3 years if the overseas,99
NA,"price falls below the guaranteed price, which",99
NA,means in turn that the total commitment by the,99
NA,Commonwealth Government would be only,99
NA,$10m over a S-years plan. That is how good this,99
NA,plan is. That is $2m a year. I almost use up that,99
NA,"amount in my own electorate, let alone my own",99
NA,farm. So whUe it may appear to be afinegesture,99
NA,by the Government to return any unused funds,99
NA,to the growers after the plan expires in 1979 it,99
NA,has really given back nothing because if the price,99
NA,drops to a minimum low for 3 years its total,99
NA,"payout wUl be, I repeat, only $10m. If the price",99
NA,remains on a reasonable level the Government,99
NA,contributes nothing but makes a fine gesture by,99
NA,returning the growers' money to them. We are,99
NA,going to give them back their own money. In,99
NA,other words that is the only contribution the,99
NA,Government wUl make.,99
NA,So much for the 5-year period. If this plan is,99
NA,carried through in its entirety for the next 5 years,99
NA,and the export price runs out at below the,99
NA,"guarantee, then the maximum contribution by",99
NA,the Government could not be above $30m a year,99
NA,"or $80m over 5 years, which is the maximum the",99
NA,Government is expected to contribute in accord-,99
NA,ance with this BUl. It could weU be said that this,99
NA,is afinecontribution. But it should be remem-,99
NA,"bered that it is over a 10-year period, which",99
NA,"would average out at $9m a year, during which",99
NA,time growers could weU make a very large,99
NA,contribution to the supplying of cheap wheat for,99
NA,"consumption in Australia, as was expounded by",99
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country,99
NA,Party earlier this evening. Their contribution to,99
NA,the supplying of cheap wheat is estimated at,99
NA,approximately $107m this year. That is on,99
NA,present day prices. The Government's contribu-,99
NA,tion wUl be a total of $90m over 10 years. That is,99
NA,how unbalanced this plan is. If the price remains,99
NA,high for 10 years the growers' contribution could,99
NA,"well be about $ 100,000m plus. In return they",99
NA,"would receive a guarantee, as I have said, of",99
NA,$80m of the taxpayers' money. But if the price,99
NA,remained high the Government would,99
NA,contribute nothing.,99
NA,All I can say to those people who suggest that,99
NA,this is a magnificent plan which will assist the,99
NA,wheat growing industry is that it is not. It is far,99
NA,from it. The growers will in the main contribute a,99
NA,lot more to the economy than they wUl receive in,99
NA,return. If inflation continues torisein Austraha at,99
NA,the present level and production costs continue,99
NA,to increase we could well see a situation by the,99
NA,time the plan expires in 5 years from now in,99
NA,which the value of their contribution of $30m,99
NA,wUl be minimised to the extent that it wUl be,99
NA,meaningless as far as a wheat stabUisation plan is,99
NA,concerned. Perhaps I should explain that by,99
NA,pointing out that if by chance costs double in 5,99
NA,years or even 10 years the present $30m wUl be,99
NA,"equivalent to about $ 15m on today's level, which",99
NA,makes the whole exercise of litde value.,99
NA,It has been said that the industry and the State,99
NA,governments have accepted this proposal. That,99
NA,is true. But I joir with the Deputy Leader of the,99
NA,Country Party in saying that they have done so,99
NA,very reluctantly. They had no alternative. It was,99
NA,a case of take it or leave it. The Government,99
NA,could not estabUsh a 5-year plan in 10 months. It,99
NA,had to take 2 years to introduce it. The industry,99
NA,certainly put up a goodfight.It obtained a few,99
NA,"concessions, but it is really not very happy about",99
NA,the overall situation. Anyone on the Government,99
NA,side of the chamber who disagrees with me in,99
NA,that respect ought to go out and talk with the,99
NA,industry about the matter. Honourable members,100
NA,opposite should talk with the individual wheat,100
NA,growers and see what they think.,100
NA,To my mind too much has been made of 2,100
NA,"other issues, namely, the removal of quotas and",100
NA,the first advance. The first advance really means,100
NA,nothing because it is drawing upon the borrow-,100
NA,"ing from the Reserve Bank, which must be",100
NA,repaid with interest. So the higher thefirstad-,100
NA,vance the longer the delay in the second advance,100
NA,"and, naturally, the more the interest which will",100
NA,have to be repaid. I should add that the present,100
NA,rate of interest is somewhere about 60 per cent,100
NA,above the previous range obtained by the former,100
NA,Government.,100
NA,"As regards the question of quotas, according",100
NA,clause 25 of the Bill this is only a postponement,100
NA,on delivery while growers cannot supply the full,100
NA,"amount of wheat. I do not disagree with this,",100
NA,let it not be said that quotas are gone for all,100
NA,time-despit e today's announcement that the,100
NA,Austrahan Wheatgrowers Federation has deGovernment,100
NA,cided against quotas and has removed them for,100
NA,the time being. As soon as delivery reaches,100
NA,figure that will use up the agreed upon loan,100
NA,"the Reserve Bank, no doubt quotas will be",100
NA,"introduced, even under this Government. I make",100
NA,no apology for saying that. This,100
NA,ceptable because the wheat industry has no,100
NA,troubles at the presenttime.But if we return to a,100
NA,"period when the world price for wheat is low, this",100
NA,plan will be of little value to the wheat industry.,100
NA,I wish to place a few of these things on record wUlaccept,100
NA,because I beheve that the time will come when that be,100
NA,people will regret that they,100
NA,wheat stabilisation plan. Many things have hapthroughout the naturally,100
NA,pened since this legislation was introduced by Leader of the Australian,100
NA,the Minister for Northern Development,100
NA,Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr Patteraccept this legislation but that the,100
NA,son). The Australian Wheat Board has not,100
NA,able to honour its earher announcement to the wUl not read the proposed amendmentofagain.,100
NA,effect that in August it would pay 20c a bushel,100
NA,the 1973-74 wheat harvest. I am not critical,100
NA,the Board for making that announcement. I,100
NA,heve that the Chairman of the Board may have this,100
NA,"been premature in making the announcement, again.",100
NA,but I think that he did it under pressure. I think wheat growers,100
NA,that he did it in the interests,100
NA,order to give people the opportunity to budget Federation to get athe,100
NA,and also to give to those people who wanted to fore something very,100
NA,"borrow money some confidence as to when they Therefore, I beheve that",100
NA,"could expect to receive some money. But because House, being from 2 responsible",100
NA,of industrial unrest this payment of 20c a bushel alternative but to support the amendment,100
NA,was not forthcoming. So we have had to wait.,100
NA,The Bill also includes a new provision in,100
NA,36(2). This sub-clause gives,100
NA,Wheat Board authority to borrow from sources,100
NA,outside the normal channels of the rural credits,100
NA,division of the Reserve Bank. I will be quite,100
NA,frank about this: I do not like this sub-clause.,100
NA,Ever since there has been a wheat stabUisation,100
NA,plan we have always borrowed our money from,100
NA,the Reserve Bank. Why should we go outside the,100
NA,bank now? WUl we find that because we have,100
NA,created the precedent of borrowing from outside,100
NA,"the Reserve Bank, on some future occasion when",100
NA,the chips are a bit short somewhere the wheat,100
NA,industry wUl be encouraged to go outside the,100
NA,Reserve Bank and to borrow privately? Honour-,100
NA,able members who have read today's,100
NA,newspapers wUl know that the Australian Wool,100
NA,Corporation appUed to the private trading banks,100
NA,to for some funds to keep the new wool plan finan-,100
NA,ciaUy sound. But what happened today? The,100
NA,request for funds was rejected by the private,100
NA,but trading banks. Now I understand that the,100
NA,Government is to caU a special Cabinet meeting,100
NA,to consider introducing legislation to enable the,100
NA,to provide the necessary funds. I do,100
NA,"not know the finer detaUs of the proposal, but",100
NA,a that is what is proposed in principle. We could,100
NA,from find ourselves in the position where the wheat,100
NA,industry would be expected to go to private,100
NA,enterprise to borrow money to meet the first ad-,100
NA,legislation is acvance payments.,100
NA,I support the broad principles of a wheat,100
NA,stabUisation plan. I realise that we are cornered,100
NA,and that we have no alternative. We either,100
NA,this plan or we reject it. If we reject it there,100
NA,were,100
NA,no plan at all for the coming season. If,100
NA,"the case, in the presentfinancialsitu-",100
NA,have accepted this ation I would,100
NA,see chaos occurring,100
NA,wheat industry. The Deputy,100
NA,Country Party has,100
NA,and moved an amendment along,100

NA,lines that we,100

NA,"till now, we have seen the price of a 2 lb loaf",101
NA,"bread in Sydney increase from 23c to 35c, with",101
NA,prophesy it will be increased by another 2c per,101
NA,loaf in the very near future. In the baking induswe,101

NA,"costs in the last 14 months: Labour, 55 per cent;",101
NA,"inputs other than flour, 12 per cent; interest",101
NA,"charges, 10 per cent plus another astronomical",101

NA,"largely to milling cost increases, whilst the",101

NA,"the main substance, wheat, have been more than",101
NA,twice as important in determining the price of able,101

NA,costs more to slice and wrap a loaf of bread than quantityand,101
NA,"the wheat content is worth. Even if the AusmUlion tonnes,",101

NA,increase over the period to which I have referred.,101
NA,"It istimethe pendulum swung the other way,",101
NA,that we dispensed with the catch cry 'Cheap,101

NA,pungent comment: 'You have never,101
NA,had it so good'? We will not let them forget that.,101
NA,There is a new rhythm of concern in the rural,101
NA,and they can be assured of prickly disputes,101
NA,from this side of the House. As the honourable,101

NA,each year in line with other wage increases.,105
NA,wUl not stand idly by while the quaUty of,105
NA,traUan rural Ufe deteriorates and the farmers are,105
NA,banished by a hostile Labor Government to,105
NA,economic wUderness. Surely the Government,105
NA,not so blind as to be unable to see that this,105
NA,only economic madness but it is also economic,105
NA,blindness. I want to pomt out that if the,105
NA,operators aUowance had been a variable and,105
NA,"afixedterm item in the year 1971-72, the home",105
NA,consumption price would have been increased,105
NA,by 1.16c per bushel and in 1972-73 by another,105
NA,1.73c in addition. And it would have been just-,105
NA,return of increase in the economic bloodstream,105

NA,is unlikely to happen. But remember that the,105
NA,industry is already subsidising the population,105
NA,this year by $l07.865m. The Government conwas,105
NA,tribution to stabUisation should be by way,105
NA,"grants as provided previously, not loans.",105
NA,Government is so guarded that it requires,105
NA,ment to it of any surplus accruing fromtimeto,105
NA,"time forthwith, and will not allow the scheme",105
NA,befinalisedat the end of the term. What a petty,105
NA,"outlook. If it was not so important, one could",105
NA,almost laugh at the Government's telegraphed,105
NA,poisonous views on rural people and people,105
NA,depend on rural industry.,105
NA,There are some changes in the wording ofthe,105
NA,legislation on which I invite the Minister's com-,105
NA,"ments, either now or in the Committee stage.",105
NA,"First I refer to clause 11, sub-clauses (1), (2)",105
NA,"and (2) (b), which differ from the relative",105
NA,tion 10 in the previous Act. There is a change,105
NA,"wording, emphasis and format. What sinister",105
NA,reasoning is behind the inclusion of the words,105
NA,'reason of misbehaviour' and the changing of the,105
NA,word 'may' to 'shaU' in sub-clause (2). This is,105
NA,to obviously sociaUsed centrahstic control. No,105
NA,longer is the Minister to have a discretion as to,105
NA,what he shaU do as the clause dictates. Obviously,105
NA,is a reflection of left wing control in Caucus.,105
NA,The Minister is being told what he is to do. He is,105
NA,not strong enough to resist. He is letting the,105
NA,industry down and is recreant to his responsibUi-,105
NA,ties. WUl the Minister tell us what 'mischievous,105
NA,apbehaviour' is? WUl a member be removed be-,105
NA,cause he wiU not accept a bad directive from the,105
NA,alGovernment? WUl he be able to defend himself,105
NA,or wUl he be summarily ejected? I want to protest,105
NA,at the sense of Government control that per-,105
NA,meates the legislation. I want the Minister to teU,105
NA,We us that the Government wUl not remove decent,105
NA,Ausmembers of the AustraUan Wheat Board from,105
NA,the positions to which they have been elected by,105
NA,rank and file wheat growers and replace them,105
NA,"is with Al Grassby, Jack Egerton, Bob Hawke and",105
NA,is not even Jack Mundey or Halfpenny. We want the,105
NA,Minister to teU us what he means when he says,105
NA,ownerthat a member of the Austrahan Wheat Boad,105
NA,not can be removed for 'mischievous behaviour'.,105
NA,Mr Killen-The y think wheat grows on a vine.,105
Mr MCVEIGH,I am very grateful to the,105
NA,a honourable member for Moreton who says that,105
NA,members of the Labor Party think that wheat,105
NA,the grows on a vine. They wUl even have it growing,105
NA,on on trees soon. Why was the clause 15 (2),105
NA,removed from the present Act? Why is it not,105
NA,spelt out accurately and without equivocation,105
NA,that personnel employed by the Board are not,105
NA,members of the Public Service? Is the Govern-,105
NA,ment trying to create a situation where it wants to,105
NA,dictate to the Australian Wheat Board whom it is,105
NA,to employ and whom it is to sack? Previously it,105
NA,spelt out quite specifically that members of,105
NA,of the AustraUan Wheat Board were not members,105
NA,The of the Pubhc Service. My electors in Darling,105
NA,payDowns have asked me to protest about the most,105
NA,despicable action of the Government in employ-,105
NA,to ing unqualified people in certain positions.,105
NA,Surely the Austrahan Wheat Board is entitled to,105
NA,"be master of its own destiny, captain of its own",105
NA,"crew, as to whom it employs or does not employ?",105
NA,who Why should it have to advertise throughout,105
NA,Australia from among the Pubhc Service? I want,105
NA,the Minister to assure us that a mistake has been,105
NA,made in omitting this clause from the legislation,105
NA,We want to ask: When a directive is issued by,105
NA,(a) the Minister for wheat to be sold on terms as in,105
NA,"secinstrument of foreign pohcy, wUl the Minister",105
NA,in assure us that the Government wUl meet all ex-,105
NA,penses including forward exchange cover at,105
NA,present costing AVi per cent. WUl the Govern-,105
NA,ment pay the loss due to interest which cannot be,105
NA,expected to match the present all time high rate,106
NA,charged by the Rural Credits Department of the,106
NA,Reserve Bank on overdraft from the Board? This,106
NA,increased interest rate in itself will cost the wheat,106
NA,grower many thousands of dollars in an ordinary,106
NA,"year. Will the Government, when it is using the",106
NA,wheat industry as an instrument of foreign pol-,106
NA,"icy, pick up the bill for increased storage and",106
NA,handling charges? Its acdons give us no reason,106
NA,"for confidence. Rather, they give us increasing",106
NA,cause for concern. We do not trust the word of,106
NA,the Government. We want these things down on,106
NA,paper where they cannot be erased and by which,106
NA,the Government can be brought to judgement.,106
NA,The honourable member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr,106
NA,Whan) was easily torpedoed by the honourable,106
NA,member for Wimmera when he said: 'We have,106
NA,increased thefirstadvance to $1.20. The Govern-,106
NA,ment is kicking us in the teeth when we are down,106
NA,by increasing interest on overdraft and with,106
NA,"inflation running at a record level, as reported in",106
NA,"today's Press, of 20 per cent. What utter hypoc-",106
NA,risy the Government has put forward in this de-,106
NA,bate.,106
NA,I ask: What type of Minister have we? Is it not,106
NA,about time that he grasped the nettle and stood,106
NA,up and was counted? He is a prisoner of the,106
NA,"Treasurer. I refer to clause 35, sub-clause (2) (c)",106
NA,and clause 36 sub-clause (2). In the old legis-,106
NA,lation the only power the Treasurer had was to,106
NA,approve of a bank but now the Minister is sub-,106
NA,servient to the Treasurer. He cannot even handle,106

Mr MCVEIGH,Ho w can one control costs at,106

NA,labour is employed. It is good labour. I commend,106
NA,aU the employees of the Austrahan Wheat Board,106
NA,and the Queensland Wheat Board for their,106
NA,"loyalty to the industry, for their wholehearted",106
NA,approach ofa fair day's work for a fair day's pay,106
NA,his own portfoho. The wheat industry is not a,106
NA,mechanical toy to be wound up or used in a game,106
NA,of tug-of-war with the Minister who is obviously,106
NA,being sawn off at the knees for having the effron-,106
NA,tery to support Whidam and to challenge the left,106
NA,wing machine. He was cleaned up and now he is,106
NA,letting the industry down. He will notfightfor us.,106

NA,allowing Treasury to interfere in their depart-,106

NA,of the bush that just would not be on. But the,106
NA,present Minister is pushed around. He is merely,106

NA,and for thenfreedom from strikes and stop-,106
NA,pages. But they are the victims of the savage,106
NA,economic proposals of this Government. The,106
NA,cost of standard storage construction in,106
NA,"Queensland has increased from $ 135,000 4 years",106
NA,"ago to a staggering $218,000 now. This is an",106
NA,increase of 61 per cent. How can we contain,106
NA,costs? WUl not the stevedores co-operate? By,106
NA,senseless stoppages they recently cost the,107
NA,"industry in this country $200,000 through",107
NA,murrage. As my friends the honourable member,107
NA,"for Wimmera, the Deputy Leader of the Ausscheme;",107
NA,"trahan Country Party, the honourable member",107
NA,for New England ( Mr Sinclair) and the honourtuaUy,107
NA,"able member for Moore ( Mr Hyde) stated, the",107
NA,stevedores through their scurrilous activity and,107
NA,completely irresponsible attitude denied the,107
NA,Austrahan wheat farmer a second advance,107
NA,which should have been paid about a month ago.,107
NA,Mr Lucock-The y nearly ruined,107
NA,industry too.,107
Mr MCVEIGH,As my friend the honourable expired.,107
NA,"member for Lyne says, they not only ruined the",107
NA,Austrahan rural industries but also refused to,107
NA,allow the Austrahan housewife to have eggs on,107
NA,her breakfast table. They denied Austrahan,107
NA,dren access to this very beneficial food. There,107
NA,must be a national reawakening of conscience if,107
NA,costs are to be brought under control. No wonder,107
NA,there is an annual increase of 3c a bushel in,107
NA,handling costs. There does need to be co-opera-,107
NA,tion with the work force. Only last week the Aus-,107
NA,trahan Wheat Board issued a statement drawing,107
NA,attention to the situation which had developed,107
NA,"foUowing industrial unrest and curtaUment of Armitage, J. L.",107
NA,"shipping. My final point is that Austraha could Barnard, L. H.",107
NA,"lose sales on account of insect damage and presBeazley, K.E.",107
NA,"ence. These sales are endangered at the present Berinson,",107
NA,"time. We are reminded of the Minister's inabUity Bowen, Lionel",107
NA,to persuade his academically orientated Caucus,107
NA,"and Cabinet coUeagues ofthe seriousness ofthe Cairns,",107
NA,"situation. His actions, hke so many of his stateCass, M. H.",107
NA,"ments, give positive proof that his promises are",107
NA,"hke snow in the midday sun-the y gUtter but Coates, J.",107
NA,they melt away.,107
NA,The industry and the State governments were,107
NA,prepared to help to eradicate this serious insect,107
NA,problem provided there was matching Common-,107
NA,wealth finance. But rural Austraha was once,107
NA,again sideswiped into obhvion when it mattered.,107
NA,I hope that sense wUl prevaU and that the aca-,107
NA,demics wUl not hide behind a wall of arrogance,107
NA,but wUl reaUse that our whole industry could be,107
NA,"threatened because of resistance of live bisects to Hayden, W. G.",107
NA,present chemicals. I want to endorse the remarks,107
NA,of the honourable member for Moore ( Mr,107
NA,Hyde). He appealed to everyone associated with,107
NA,the wheat industry to make sure they put for-,107
NA,ward an absolutely top quahty product. The,107
NA,world is crying out for supplies of foodstuffs and,107
NA,essential eating materials. I think this was,107
NA,outlined in very great detaU by the Deputy,107
NA,Leader ofthe Country Party.,107
NA,flour Never before have the AustraUan wheat,107
NA,degrowers been let down so badly. As my Deputy,107
NA,"Leader says, we have not got a stabUisation",107
NA,what we have got is an equalisation plan,107
NA,wherein the Government wUl contribute vir-,107
NA,nothing and the Austrahan wheat growers,107
NA,wUl be forced to accept in the base year as the,107
NA,equalised price-no t a stabihsed price- a sum of,107
NA,"$2 which, in effect, is roughly only two-thirds of",107
NA,the price that they could obtain on the world,107
NA,market. This base of $2 in the base year will have,107
NA,an effect in future years because of the formula,107

Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson-Minister for,108
NA,Northern Development and Minister for the 36,108
NA,Northern Territory) (10.1)- I wish to move an,108
NA,amendment to clause 2 on behalf of the Governreason,108
NA,ment. Honourable members will recall the recent,108
NA,announcement by the Minister for Agriculture,108
NA,(Senator Wriedt) that the Government had carearly,108
NA,ried out an examination to see what could be,108
NA,done to assist the Austrahan Wheat Board to,108
NA,make progress payments on the 1973-74,108
NA,season's wheat pool as early as possible. As,108
NA,"result, the Minister said that the Government",108
NA,intended to seek the early passage of the Bill,108
NA,we are exanuning at present. Clause 36 ofthe Bill,108
NA,provides for the Wheat Board to have the power,108
NA,to borrow commercially. Such borrowings could,108
NA,"be used, if necessary, to enable the Board to meet",108
NA,the scheduled payments. To ensure that this,108
NA,rowing power is available at the earhest opportheir,108
NA,"tunity, I move:",108
NA,"Omit 'a date to befixedby Proclamation', insen 'the day",108
NA,on which it receives the Royal Assent'.,108
NA,The amendment seeks to provide that the Act,108
NA,"Sinclair, I. MCC. shall operate from the date of royal assent rather",108
NA,Street^ .A.,108
NA,than a date to befixedby proclamation.,108
NA,"Wentworth, W. C.",108
NA,"WUson, L B. C.",108
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (10.2)-The,108
NA,Opposition does not object to this amendment.,108
NA,"But, in indicating our acceptance of it, let me say",108
NA,that we trust that the purpose of the amendment,108
NA,is as simple as it is expressed to be. We on this,108
NA,side of the Committee feel that the Government,108
NA,has been completely neglectful of its responsi-,108
NA,bility to ensure that the Australian Wheat Board,108
NA,in this instance was able to proceed with the de-,108
NA,livery of wheat through the terminals and the,108
NA,shipping facihties that traditionally have been,108
NA,the oudets for that product. If the expeditious,108
NA,passage of the Bill is designed so that the,108
NA,Government can avoid its responsibility to settle,108
NA,industrial disputes and to maintain the free flow,108
NA,"of trade, I beheve that that issue needs to be con-",108
NA,sidered as well as the far more plausible reason,108
NA,which the Minister for Northern Development,108
NA,and Minister for the Northern Territory (Dr,108
NA,Patterson) has enunciated.,108
NA,It is true that the passage of this Bill will en-,108
NA,able the Austrahan Wheat Board to exercise the,108
NA,additional powers which it is to be given in ac-,108
NA,with the extended provisions of clause,108
NA,36 of the Bill. But the Opposition is concerned,108
NA,that this extension of power should not be used,108
NA,In Committee by the Government purely to avoid its responsi-,108
NA,bihty to maintain the free flow of trade. For that,108
NA,"reason, this amendment is acceptable only if it is",108
NA,for the purpose of exercising the legitimate bor-,108
NA,rowing power and is not being proposed because,108
NA,the Government seeks to avoid its responsibihty.,108
NA,"In fact, my comments pertain more to clause",108
NA,than to the introduction of the provisions of,108
NA,"this Bill at the earher date. But, because the",108
NA,given by the Minister relates to powers,108
NA,"expressed in clause 36,1 think it is necessary that",108
NA,the Committee consider the imphcations of the,108
NA,"passage of the Bill. I trust that, in present-",108
NA,"ing the argument that he has presented tonight,",108
NA,the Minister will accept the proposition that the,108
NA,power to borrow commercially should not be,108
NA,a used by the Government as a device to avoid its,108
NA,responsibihty to maintain the availability of fuel,108
NA,that to enable trains to move the grain from the,108
NA,"inland terminals to the ports, its responsibility to",108
NA,keep ships handling cargoes which have been,108
NA,presold and on which letters of credit have been,108
NA,received and to ensure that industrial disruption,108
NA,bordoes not prevent vessels in port from loading,108
NA,"cargoes, or the Government's responsibihty",108
NA,to keep the commodity flowing in the way that it,108
NA,should flow and in areas in which the Govern-,108
NA,ment has a responsibihty so to do. For that,108
NA,"reason, the Opposition has reservations about",109
NA,"the reasons that the Minister advances, but",109
NA,accepts the amendment that he has moved.,109
Mr MCVEIGH ,Darling Downs) (10.5)- I,109
NA,support the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the,109
NA,Austrahan Country Party ( Mr Sinclair) and state,109
NA,for the record that the Austrahan Country Party,109
NA,and the other Opposiuon members fully support,109
NA,getting out advances to the Austrahan wheat,109
NA,growers as soon as possible. What we are,109
NA,opposed to is creating an environment wherein,109
NA,"irresponsible trade unions, feather-bedded by a",109
NA,government-,109
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Scholes)-I would,109
NA,suggest that the honourable gendeman speak to,109
NA,the clause under consideration.,109
Mr MCVEIGH, I am just developing the,109
NA,point-,109
The CHAIRMAN,Havin g given the Deputy,109
NA,"Leader of the Country Party fair leeway, I point",109
NA,out to the honourable member that the clause,109
NA,deals only with an alteration from the date of,109
NA,proclamation to the date of royal assent. We are,109
NA,not in a second reading debate; it is a committee,109
NA,debate and that is all that is before the Com-,109
NA,mittee. The reasons for the alteration which were,109
NA,given by the Minister do not allow for a very ex-,109
NA,tended debate.,109
Mr MCVEIGH,"Than k you, Mr Chairman.",109
NA,There was so much chatter in the chamber at the,109
NA,time that it was difficult for us up here to under-,109
NA,stand what was going on. The Deputy Leader of,109
NA,the Country Party made a fleeting reference to,109
NA,clause 36 (2) and I thought that that must have,109
NA,been the clause we were discussing. I want to em-,109
NA,phasise that the reason for having to speed the,109
NA,legislative process is the tardiness of the Aus-,109
NA,tralian Government in putting through this legis-,109
NA,"lation which has lain on the table, as it were, for 3",109
NA,months and 2 days. We object to that tardiness,109
NA,up to the present time but we do support this,109
NA,speedy assent in order to allow the Austrahan,109
NA,farmers to get the advantage which is jusdy due,109
NA,to them and which was promised to them.,109
NA,Amendment agreed to.,109
NA,"Clause as amended, agreed to.",109
NA,Clauses 3 to 24-b y leave-take n together.,109
Mr MCVEIGH ,Darling Downs) (10.7)-In undertaking,109
NA,respect of clause 8 I want to make a few brief,109
NA,comments.,109
Mr CLYDE CAMERON ,Mak e them very brief.,109
Mr MCVEIGH,Having hstened to my good legislation,109
NA,friend the Minister for Labor and Immigration,109
NA,( Mr Clyde Cameron) sickening us on many,109
NA,"occasions, I trust that he will have the decency to",109
NA,hsten and so learn something about one of our,109
NA,"very great rural industries, about which he",109
NA,knows nothing and cares less. I refer to clause 8.,109
NA,We are concerned at recent statements by the,109
NA,Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) that,109
NA,he is going to end the Country Parry hold on,109
NA,boards. The Minister made it clear that he was,109
NA,going to dismantle Country Party dominated,109
NA,commodity boards. We want an assurance from,109
NA,the Minister that the personnel of the Austrahan,109
NA,"Wheat Board, as provided for in clause 8, will",109
NA,remain the same as it has been since the incep-,109
NA,"tion of the Board. That is to say, the growers of",109
NA,"the commodity, who in the final analysis are the",109
NA,"owners of the commodity, elect to that Board",109
NA,people whom they deemfitto be elected as their,109
NA,representatives. We are totaUy opposed to the,109
NA,proposition that a Minister sitting in another,109
NA,place can dismiss summarUy people elected by,109
NA,the industry and have them replaced with some,109
NA,second-hand petty trade union official. We want,109
NA,the assurance of the Minister that the people who,109
NA,own the wheat wUl still elect their own represen-,109
NA,tatives.,109
Mr KING ,Wimmera) (lO.lO)-The honour-,109
NA,able member for Darling Downs ( Mr MCVeigh),109
NA,"has made a legitimate request to the Minister,",109
NA,but it appears that the Minister is not even going,109
NA,to attempt to reply. I appeal to him to give the,109
NA,honourable member for Darling Downs an as-,109
NA,surance in relation to the matter he raised in,109
NA,clause 8. Surely we can get some sort of assur-,109
NA,ance from the Minister representing the Minister,109
NA,for Agriculture. If we cannot get that assurance,109
NA,as members of the Opposition where do we go?,109
NA,Are we to be ignored by the Minister represent-,109
NA,ing the Minister for Agriculture? Will the,109
NA,Minister please give the member for Darling,109
NA,Downs an assurance in response to his request?,109
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson-Minister for,109
NA,Northern Development and Minister for the,109
NA,"Northern Territory) (10.11)- I shaU respond, in",109
NA,view of the insistence by the honourable member,109
NA,"for Wimmera ( Mr King). However, I would sug-",109
NA,gest that the honourable member read the sec-,109
NA,"ond reading speech, which says that the Board",109
NA,wUl have the same membership as provided for,109
NA,in the existing legislation. This gives effect to the,109
NA,given to the industry in March this,109
NA,year. The Austrahan Government position is that,109
NA,whilst it is not prepared to tie its hands com-,109
NA,pletely in respect of the composition of the Aus-,109
NA,"tralian Wheat Board for the next 5 years, the",109
NA,for the new stabUisation plan provides,109
NA,for a continuation of the present composition of,109
NA,the Board and there is no present intention to,109
NA,change the legislation to alter that composition,110
NA,during the S-year period. It is unlikely that,110
NA,Government would be giving consideration to,110
NA,"this matter within the next 2 to 3 years, and",110
NA,proposals for change which might then be inicommon,110
NA,tiated will be fully discussed with the,110
NA,"and with State Ministers of Agriculture at, of",110
NA,"course, the Australian Agricultural Council. It",110
NA,"should be added that the Labor Party platform, Clause 25.",110
NA,in providmg for adequate representation for pri-,110
NA,mary producers on all boards effecting the hand- (3),110
NA,"ling and marketing of their products, does not red",110
NA,preclude a majority of elected growers' represenwheat,110
NA,tatives on such boards.,110
Mr MCVEIGH ,Darling Downs) (10.12)-,110
NA,Representatives of the industry have asked me to (b) the,110
NA,ascertain from the Minister a definition of the,110
NA,"word 'misbehaviour' in clause 11(1), This word",110
NA,is included in the legislation but did not appear,110
NA,in the previous legislation. Men of great honesty,110
NA,and integrity who have the confidence of their,110
NA,industry are concerned that a further word has,110
NA,been included without a clear deiinition of its immediately,110
NA,meaning or information on the premise on or the wheat,110
NA,reason for which the Minister may terminate,110
NA,appointment of a member of a Board,110
NA,"of misbehaviour. On behalf of those gendemen, I (b)",110
NA,want to know what is the strict definition of the,110
NA,word 'misbehaviour* so that these men can have (5),110
NA,"confidence in the future. In a responsible organble,",110
NA,isation there is nothing worse than having the (3),110
NA,men in control of that organisation,110
NA,being regarded publicly as scoundrels because,110
NA,"they have seenfit,in the interests of the people Northern",110
NA,"they represent, to oppose an irresponsible",110
NA,tion that could be given by a Minister.,110
NA,beyond the realms of possibility that the Minister,110
NA,may direct a sale to be made on other than comnot,110
NA,mercial terms and prices for the sake of domestic,110
NA,or foreign pohcy. He may direct that certain proceeds,110
NA,types of wheat shall be sold at certain prices. He,110
NA,may direct that the milling trade is to,110
NA,at a lower price to serve certain people. The,110
NA,trahan Wheat Board could be forced to give granted.,110
NA,wheat which belongs to the growers,110
NA,countries at the expense of the growers. In that,110
NA,"instance, if a member of the Wheat Board stuck tute",110
NA,"to his guns, exercised the sacred trust that had",110
NA,been placed in him and disapproved of the,110
NA,"action and direction of the Mimster, he could be",110
NA,summarily ejected. I ask the Minister now to,110
NA,define the word 'misbehaviour' and state on,110
NA,what grounds a Minister may terminate the,110
NA,appointment ofa responsibly elected member of,110
NA,the Austrahan Wheat Board.,110
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson-Minister for,110
NA,Northern Development and Minister for the,110
NA,Northern Territory) (10.15)-The word 'misbe-,110
NA,the haviour' is not something which just happens to,110
NA,be used in this Bill. If the honourable member,110
NA,any had read other Acts he would know that it is a,110
NA,term used in practically all the Acts,110
NA,industry dealing with statutory boards.,110
NA,Clauses agreed to.,110
NA,The pool for a quota season (in this sub-section refer-,110
NA,to as 'the relevant season') consists of the following,110
NA,delivered to the Board (whether in pursuance of this,110
NA,Act or of a law of a State)-,110
NA,(a) wheat which is quota wheat in relation to the relevant,110
NA,season; and,110
NA,any other wheat of the relevant season delivered in,110
NA,"relevant season, or any wheat of an earlier quota",110
NA,season that was not included in a pool for an earlier,110
NA,"season, that is declared by the Board to have been",110
NA,"sold by the Board, by way of expon sale or sale for",110
NA,"expon, at a premium on the price of Australian stan-",110
NA,"dard white wheat, and paid for in full, during the",110
NA,relevant season.,110
NA,(4) The,110
NA,pool for a season that is not a quota season but,110
NA,follows a quota season consists ofthe following,110
NA,delivered to the Board (whether in pursuance of this,110
NA,the Act or of a law of a State)-,110
NA,by reason (a) wheat of that season; and,110
NA,"wheat of an earlier season, being a quota season, that",110
NA,was not included in the pool for an earlier season.,110
NA,"The Board may, in such manner as it considers equita-",110
NA,for the purposes of a declaration under paragraph,110
NA,"(b), attribute sales of wheat of a particular kind to all or",110

Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson-Minister for,110
NA,Development and Minister for the,110
NA,direcNorthern Territory),110
NA,It is not introduced last July it(10.16)-Since,110
NA,has become,110
NA,the Bill was,110
NA,apparent that,110
NA,"there is a deficiency in this clause, in that it does",110
NA,authorise the Board to account for the sales,110
NA,"ingly, I seek",110
NA,of certain non-quota wheat. Accord-,110
NA,to move the 2 amendments together.,110
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Scholes)-Is leave,110
NA,"Ausgranted? There being no objection, leave is",110
Dr PATTERSON, I move:,110
NA,"In sub-clause (3), omit paragraphs (a) and (b) and substi-",110
NA,the following paragraphs:-,110
NA,'(a) wheat which is quota wheat in relation to the,110

NA,the relevant season.'.,111
NA,"In sub-clause (5), after'paragraph(3) (b)'insert'or(c)'.",111
NA,The amendments will ensure that all non-quota,111
NA,wheat delivered to the Board is ultimately,111
NA,"included in a pool for a season. However, the",111
NA,only non-quota wheat which will be included,111
NA,the pool for the season in which it is grown is,111
NA,wheat sold for export at a premium during that whole.,111
NA,season.,111
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (10.17)-The wanted,111
NA,Opposiuon supports the amendments. I can BUl.,111
NA,understand the reasons for the request and I,111
NA,know something of the background to it. The,111
NA,only comment that I would make is that it seemsof,111
NA,to us that it would perhaps be preferable,111
NA,instead of referring only to premium wheat,111
NA,which is sold on the basis of being non-quota,111
NA,"wheat but being readily saleable, the amendreviewed",111
NA,ments were rephrased so that all wheat which,111
NA,readily saleable could be included. It is true that,111
NA,generally premium wheat is the category of,111
NA,wheat which can more readilyfindexport marvahd,111
NA,"kets, but in the climate of world demand which",111
NA,has been so variable in the last few years and,111
NA,with the expected increase in demand for feed,111
NA,grains it is possible that some of the lower gradesreturns,111
NA,of wheat-secon d grade wheat and some of the,111
NA,soft wheats- could all be readily saleable in,111
NA,particular year.,111
NA,While in the present market circumstances,111
NA,"quotas are to be applied, we are really talking",111
NA,a degree about an academic subject. I beheve,111
NA,"that it is still necessary, if these amendments",111
NA,"to be passed, that the whole of the context",111
NA,"which readily saleable wheats need to be BUl,",111
NA,included witlun a quota year for the purpose,111
NA,which these amendments embrace should be,111
NA,"considered. It is the Opposition's view that,",111
NA,"whilst accepting these amendments, there would",111
NA,be an advantage if their ambit were extended.,111
NA,Whilst I do not expect the Minister for Northernrepayment,111
NA,Development (Dr Patterson),111
NA,accept the suggestion I trust that he will bring it the moment the ofthe,111
NA,to the attention ofhis colleague in another place the world wUl certainly of,111
NA,and consider whether the amendments might be the wheat industry. I beheve,111
NA,broadened so that not only premium,111
NA,all wheats which might be readily saleable in a duction of grain. It is one of theencourage,111
NA,quota year and which are in excess of the quotaindustries,111
NA,might be included.,111
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson-Minister for prejudiced,111
NA,Northern Development and Mimster for the,111
NA,Northern Territory) (10.18)-NaturaIly at this,111
NA,stage I am not prepared to accept the suggestionthe,111
NA,"beforebut, from Ustening to the arguments that the",111
NA,honourable member for New England ( Mr,111
NA,"by Sinclair) has put forward, I can certainly see the",111
NA,"for in full, before or during",111
NA,logic in it. I assure him that I wUl bring those ar-,111
NA,guments to the notice of the Minister for,111
NA,Agriculture (Senator Wriedt).,111
NA,Amendments agreed to.,111
NA,"in Clause, as amended, agreed to.",111
NA,Remainder of BUl-b y leave-take n as a,111
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (10.19)- I,111
NA,to comment on a couple of aspects of this,111
NA,I do not want to repeat the second reading,111
NA,speech as I know that we are running out of time.,111
NA,In the course of my speech on the second reading,111
NA,the BUl I asked the Minister for Northern,111
NA,"if, Development (Dr Patterson) for an assurance",111
NA,that the owner-operators aUowance as it is now,111
NA,"set, being based on some 1968figures,should be",111
NA,as early as possible. I would hope that,111
NA,isthe Minister would give that assurance.,111
NA,It seems to me that the 1968 award is hardly a,111
NA,criterion on which to base the value of an,111
NA,owner-operator's personal exertion in a year,111
NA,when inflation is running away with costs. We aU,111
NA,are aware that inflation generally has eroded,111
NA,in other sectors of the economy with a,111
NA,consequential impact on wage and salary scales.,111
NA,a For this particular rate to be a 1968 rate makes,111
NA,the whole of the assessment of the owner-,111
NA,operators allowance as the basis for the home,111
NA,"no consumption price quite incongruous. We have,",111
NA,"toin fact, been asked by some States to consider a",111
NA,formal amendment. At this stage because of the,111
NA,are statement I made earUer in the evening that we,111
NA,withinwere concerned with the early passage of the,111
NA,we do not intend to go to that length. But I,111
NA,would hope that the Minister might be able to,111
NA,give me an assurance that there wUl be an early,111
NA,revision of this owner-operators allowance.,111
NA,The other part of the legislation to which I,111
NA,wanted briefly to refer is the concept of the,111
NA,of contributions from the industry,111
NA,at this stage to during the term,111
NA,agreement. It is true that at,111
NA,nature grain markets around,111
NA,ensure the profitabUity of,111
NA,that as a result we,111
NA,wheat but should be doing all we can to,111
NA,few,111
NA,the pro-,111
NA,agricultural,111
NA,where there is any chance at aU of pro-,111
NA,"fitabUity. The chances, of course, will be",111
NA,by the degree to which this Govern-,111
NA,ment incites inflation and faUs to keep costs,111
NA,under some form of reasonable control. Within,111
NA,phrasing of these provisions-th e repayment,111
NA,during the course of the agreement and the Umi-,112
NA,tation on the Government's contribution-ther e,112
NA,are inbuUt detractions for producers to grow,112
NA,wheat in future seasons. It is true that this year,112
NA,"and probably next year-and , one would hope,",112
NA,the year after-tha t that particular attitude might,112
NA,not prevaU. But if there should be in 3 or 4 years,112
NA,"time a build-up in world grain stocks, one would",112
NA,not want to see the problems of repayment and,112
NA,would not want the wheat grower to be,112
NA,prejudiced because of the operations of this,112
NA,wheat industry equaUsation scheme. We do not,112
NA,want to deter him from producing grain. I do not,112
NA,expect the clauses to be changed. I understand,112
NA,the Government has taken a firm position on it.,112
NA,But the Opposition expresses its concern that the,112
NA,particular method of repayment during the,112
NA,course of the agreement and the manner in,112
NA,which the whole of the stabUisation scheme is,112
NA,phrased wiU be an inhibiting factor for future,112
NA,gram production. We think that it is most unfor-,112
NA,tunate.,112
NA,"I beheve, in addition, it is regrettable",112
NA,there has been no reference to production,112
NA,other grains or even consideration of alternative,112
NA,forms of agriculture in the consideration of,112
NA,wheat stabUisation agreement. I recognise why,112
NA,this is so. But I repeat again that within the,112
NA,of the clauses in this BUl to which we are,112
NA,"dressing our attention, there should obviously",112
NA,an attraction for producers to grow wheat. The indexation.,112
NA,attraction is not as great as it was and it is not as,112
NA,great as it should be. In Austrahan agriculture it,112
NA,is essentially not only a matter of producing,112
NA,"grain but also, for the future, of producing",112
NA,ever is going to be profitable. I regret that,112
NA,the context of these particular clauses there is no,112
NA,reference to any other commodity nor even a,112
NA,consideration of them in the conclusion of the,112
NA,agreement. It is true that it would not be practicosts,112
NA,cable to have them included in this scheme. But,112
NA,"regrettably, they were not even discussed, as",112
NA,"understand it, in the run-up to the phrasing",112
NA,these particular clauses. I would hope that,112
NA,Minister might be able to give me some assuramendment,112
NA,ance with respect to the change in the ownerreversed.,112
NA,"operator's allowance by, at the latest, 197S.",112
Dr PATTERSON ,Dawson-Minister for,112
NA,Northern Development and Minister for the,112
NA,Northern Territory) (10.24)- I note the second,112
NA,point made by the honourable member for New,112
NA,England ( Mr Sinclair). In relation to the owner-,112
NA,"operators aUowance, I think the honourable",112
NA,member would be aware that the Minister for,112
NA,Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) has advised the,112
NA,Austrahan Wheatgrowers Federation that he is,112
NA,prepared to have the matter re-examined next,112
NA,year in time for a decision to be taken as to,112
NA,whether the matter might be adjusted for the,112
NA,commencement of the 1975-76 season. The Fed-,112
NA,eration is apparently content with that undertak-,112
NA,"ing. I might say to the honourable member, how-",112
NA,"ever, that I personally have some sympathy for",112
NA,"this because, relying on my memory, I have a",112
NA,feeling that in 1968 I moved an amendment on,112
NA,behalf of the Labor Party when it was on the,112
NA,other side of the House that the owner-operators,112
NA,"aUowance be included in the regimen of costs,",112
NA,for assessing movements in costs to ascertain a,112
NA,new home consumption price.,112
NA,Mr King-Jus t stick to your guns.,112
Dr PATTERSON,Never mind about stick-,112
NA,ing to my guns. As a member of the government,112
NA,the honourable member opposed my amend-,112
NA,ment. Now the position is reversed and the,112
NA,present Opposition wants to move perhaps the,112
NA,"same amendment for the same reason, and, as a",112
NA,"member of the Government, I am opposing it. I",112
NA,"think the position is completely reversed, but",112
NA,that perhaps our arguments may be right. What we,112
NA,of may have to do is convince the Treasury that,112
NA,there are economic arguments which support the,112
NA,this inclusion of the owner-operator allowance. On,112
NA,"the other hand, there are arguments that other",112
NA,ambit people have put forward which the Government,112
NA,now adhas accepted to the degree that the owner-,112
NA,be operators allowance wiU not be included in the,112
NA,The point I would Uke to make to the honour-,112
NA,one able member for New England is that I think he,112
NA,"whatand I are in basic agreement, and I think most",112
NA,"within honourable members would agree, that when we",112
NA,have a high rate of inflation it is difficult to accept,112
NA,that productivity can absorb the rate of inflation,112
NA,with respect to the indexing forward of specific,112
NA,and the omission of others. This is a techni-,112
NA,cal argument. I tliink I have argued in exactly the,112
NA,I same way in which the present Opposition would,112
NA,of argue. The only difference is that I argued it 6,112
NA,"the years ago. If my memory is right, I moved an",112
NA,accordingly. The whole position is,112
NA,"However, the undertaking has been",112
NA,given by the Minister for Agriculture.,112
Mr MCVEIGH ,Darling Downs) (10.27)- I,112
NA,want to make one brief comment in relation to,112
NA,clause 29 (4).,112
NA,Mr Nicholls-On e minute.,112
Mr MCVEIGH,Who is talking? I want to,112
NA,place it on record that the stabUisation price of,112
NA,$73.49 per tonne is to many AustraUan wheat,112
NA,growers far too low when we realise that the,112
NA,expected return from last year's crop is $2.35 per,112
NA,bushel. The maximum contribution to the stabil-,113
NA,isation scheme by the growers will be 15c per,113
NA,bushel. It would appear to us that a more realistic,113
NA,stabilisation price would have been $2.20 per,113

NA,"doors. I regard the closing down of the Bureau,",113
NA,voluntary social welfare organisation in New,113
NA,"South Wales, as a national disgrace. This organ-",113
NA,isation functioned in New South Wales after its,113
NA,formation during the last war. It was formed to,113
NA,provide welfare for ex-servicemen and their de-,113
NA,pendants. After the war its objectives and func-,113
NA,tions changed. It operated in Sydney in the area,113
NA,"of Surry HUls, with a branch office in my elector-",113
NA,"ate of Parramatta, with a number of valuable",113
NA,social workers. It performed invaluable tasks,113
NA,Third Reading that were respected by the people able to use the,113
NA,facUities it offered and who were able to be,113
NA,attended by its social workers. Now all the social,113
NA,workers have been dismissed. There are 2 people,113
NA,remaining on the staff until the end of September,113
NA,to deal with the remaining administrative mat-,113
NA,ters concerning this organisation. It operated in,113
NA,Second Reading the areas of Surry HUls and Parramatta and,113
NA,advised on matters of marriage guidance and,113
NA,matters relating to immigrants. It had a number,113
NA,"of special projects of an intimate nature, includ-",113
NA,ing a special study of migrants in car plants and,113
NA,their work in those plants. It also was undertak-,113
NA,ing a special study in relation to child care in the,113
NA,"Third Reading Surry HUls area. Numbers of students, particu-",113
NA,larly those in the social work departments of the,113
NA,University of Sydney and the University of New,113
NA,"South Wales, undertook practical training with",113
NA,this organisation and gained a great deal of,113
NA,benefit from it. It was the only remaining non-,113
NA,sectarian private voluntary organisation in this,113
NA,"field in Sydney, and it has closed its doors.",113
NA,Second Reading,113
NA,I have a short table that I have copied out of,113
NA,the report on the income and expenditure of this,113
NA,organisation. In 1969 the income it received,113
NA,"amounted to $34,683 and its expenditure was",113
NA,"$28,134. It had a surplus that year of $6,549. In",113
NA,"1973 its income had risen to $56,671 and its",113
NA,"expenditure was $57,161. It had a deficit of $490.",113
NA,"Third Reading For the last financial year, 1973-74, its income",113
NA,"was $62,487 and its expenditure was $65,155. It",113
NA,"suffered a deficit of $2,668. It was envisaged that",113
NA,"in thisfinancialyear, 1974-75, on its budget its",113
NA,"income still would be in the area of $60,000 but",113
NA,"its expenditure would rise to $76,000. In these",113
NA,circumstances this organisation felt that it could,113
NA,no longer continue.,113
NA,The FamUy Welfare Bureau in fact did receive,113
NA,grants from numbers of Government depart-,113
NA,ments. It received from the Attorney-General's,113
NA,"Department a grant of some $14,800 forks mar-",113
NA,riage guidance work and from the former De-,113
NA,"partment of Immigration it received $9,452.",113
NA,the New South Wales Department of,113
NA,Youth and Community Services it received a,113
NA,"separate grant of $5,500. A total of $29,752 was",113
NA,a contributed this year by the two governments,113
NA,"and some $30,000 was raised by volunteers for",113
NA,the maintenance of this organisation. That is a,114
NA,princely sum raised by die efforts of hard-,114
NA,"working, sincere people. It is a sum which in the",114
NA,social welfare field I beheve we cannot afford to,114
NA,lose.,114
NA,"As I said, only recendy the organisation",114
NA,employed 6 social workers. More recendy it had,114
NA,"only five, but this was because of particular",114
NA,"cumstances. One ofthe social workers, as I",114
NA,"doned, was working in my own electorate. Now",114
NA,that this organisauon has closed it has assets,114
NA,"remaining of $13,000 cash. That money will be",114
NA,handed to the Smith Family to enable it to,114
NA,tinue with its work. What are the reasons for the,114
NA,closure of this organisation? I know it may,114
NA,"trite, but the figures I have read out clearly",114
NA,onstrate that increasing costs have contributed,114
NA,the closure of this voluntary organisation-infla,114
NA,"tion, in another word. Inflation has",114
NA,expected income from donations was likely to,114
NA,decrease. One of its major fund raising activities,114
NA,was the sale of Christmas cards. One of the,114
NA,things the organisation feared before it closed,114
NA,was that postage charges would rise and that in,114
NA,the rush by people to cut their own personal,114
NA,get the sale of Christmas cards would fall. This,114
NA,organisation was afraid that the income it would,114
NA,raise from this method would fall.,114
NA,Finally it was hit with the abandonment this,114
NA,"year of the Waratah Spring Festival, which",114
NA,meant that the art competition it invariably held,114
NA,was no longer available as a source of revenue,114
NA,for this year in particular. It was quite clear,114
NA,in thesetimesthe deficit from which this organisdifference,114
NA,"ation would suffer would grow, and it could",114
NA,no source of income it would be able to substitute,114
NA,for that it lost. It approached the Minister,114
NA,Social Security ( Mr Hayden) months ago,114
NA,asked him whether a voluntary organisation of,114
NA,this sort would be able to appreciate in the Austhe,114
NA,trahan assistance plan and perhaps benefit from,114
NA,"some grants in that area. Hoever, as we all",114
NA,it is not expected that grants of any real value,114
NA,will flow to voluntary organisations of this sort,114
NA,for a number of years because of the way in,114
NA,"which this plan is proceeding, perhaps quite",114
NA,properly in terms of the way in which governwhich,114
NA,ments act and the way in which the Government,114
NA,may wish to postpone expenditure in very,114
NA,tant areas.,114
NA,I know from my own involvement in the Proter,114
NA,visional Committee in Parramatta that the,114
NA,worker from the Family Welfare Bureau was,114
NA,endeavouring to assist in the promotion of that,114
NA,plan in the Parramatta district with a view to,114
NA,ticipation in it. Similar work had been done,114
NA,the inner city area to endeavour to obtain sup-,114
NA,"port through the Austrahan assistance plan, but",114
NA,quite clearly there was no prospect of assistance,114
NA,in the short term that would enable this organis-,114
NA,"ation to maintain itself. Some $20,000 would",114
NA,have been necessary for it to continue and to,114
NA,meet the prospective deficit that the organisers,114
NA,saw. They contacted the Minister for Social Se-,114
NA,"circurity when the situation became desperate, and",114
NA,menthey sought assistance from the Government to,114
NA,enable the organisation to continue its important,114
NA,"tasks. Although the late Mrs Henry, who I under-",114
NA,stand was one ofthe senior officers in the depart-,114
NA,"conment in Sydney, discussed these matters at",114
NA,length with the senior officers of the Family Wel-,114
NA,"seem fare Bureau, no means could be found whereby",114
NA,demmoney could be made available for social,114
NA,to workers to be maintained in their present pos-,114
NA,- itions and for this valuable organisation to be,114
NA,meant that its able to continue to exist.,114
NA,It may well be in the plan of this Government,114
NA,that voluntary organisations should be done,114
NA,away with and should be seen as being no longer,114
NA,important in the plan of things for providing and,114
NA,"budmeeting welfare needs. If that is so, I suppose",114
NA,that the rather callous view that no moneys can,114
NA,be made available to get this organisation out of,114
NA,its situation is the proper view to be taken. Cer-,114
NA,tainly I consider that that is the view of the,114
NA,Government when I see a situation such as that I,114
NA,have described. This organisation is closed. It,114
NA,cannot be revived. It may well be that other or-,114
NA,ganisations will go the same way. Voluntary or-,114
NA,that ganisations are important. They privide a,114
NA,in the style of things in providing wel-,114
NA,see fare needs. This difference is important in,114
NA,developing programs that might be able to ac-,114
NA,for commodate problems that a ratherfixedgovern-,114
NA,and ment style might not be able to handle. Mr,114
NA,"Speaker, I beheve it is a national disgrace that",114
NA,Government failed to act to prevent the clos-,114
NA,ure of this organisation-on e that I suspect func-,114
NA,"know, tioned in your electorate as well as mine.",114
Mr ENDERBY ,Canberra-Minister for,114
NA,Manufacturing Industry) (10.40)- I rise during,114
NA,this adjournment debate to raise certain matters,114
NA,were dealt with during the week in earher,114
NA,adjournment debates and which call for an ans-,114
NA,imporwer. On Tuesday night the honourable member,114
NA,for Bendigo ( Mr Bourchier) raised the question,114
NA,of the level of imports into the country. The mat-,114
NA,has received considerable comment recently,114
NA,social in the Press and from other honourable,114
NA,members. Honourable members will recall that,114
NA,last year the Government took certain action to,114
NA,"parreduce tariffs by 25 per cent, and it substantially",114
NA,in revalued the exchange rates with regard to the,114
NA,Australian dollar. Honourable members will recontain,115
NA,call also that these steps were taken at the timeted,115
NA,because of the inflationary impact that was,115
NA,beginning to bit Austraha and because of the,115
NA,universal assessment that the situation was,115
NA,result of excess demand. One might attribute,115
NA,excess demand to the failure of the previous,115
NA,Government to take action. But it happened,115
NA,some time ago and it is not proper to make the,115
NA,"point again now. There was excess demand, and",115
NA,the problem was how to increase supply.,115
NA,This series of steps was taken at thattimeto,115
NA,"bring about an increase in imports. Of course,",115
NA,was appreciated that certain beneficial forms,115
NA,structural change to Austrahan industry might,115
NA,brought about at that time as well. One must,115
NA,call that at that time Australian reserves were at,115
NA,"an unusually high level, and it must be propriate.",115
NA,emphasised that reserves are not,115
NA,"having been built up to record level, should be",115
NA,maintained indefinitely. If we are to steady,115
NA,inflation we must make use of them.,115
NA,not mean of course that the Government will,115
NA,"allow, or intends to allow, a flood of imports",115
NA,damage Austrahan industry. The Government is,115
NA,acting responsibly to prevent undue disruption,115
NA,that regard.,115
NA,The honourable member for Bendigo raised national,115
NA,the question of the effect on employment of been,115
NA,imports and of our actions to alleviate the probfrom,115
NA,lems of 2 industries-th e textile and apparel the Government,115
NA,industries. I think he mentioned also the footassistance to relieve,115
NA,wear industry. In the early months of this year areas through assistance,115
NA,"the textile industry was enjoying relatively buoywhich, because of some across",115
NA,ant conditions-perhap s unusually buoyant,115
NA,ditions. Reservations were being expressed as to experiencing some disadvantage both at are,115
NA,"the long term prospects, because one knows",115
NA,the industry has been in decline for many years.,115
NA,But there was not at thattimeany demonstrable,115
NA,injury being suffered from imports. As the,115
NA,"progressed the situation did, however, change.",115
NA,FoUowing complaints and investigation by the,115
NA,Department of Manufacturing Industry,115
NA,"references were made to the Textile Authority,",115
NA,"which the Government set up earher this year,",115
NA,the Industries Assistance Commission. Action,115
NA,was taken to contam imports of items of knitwear,115
NA,and woven apparel. Import Ucensing,115
NA,were introduced on imports from Taiwan. Simi-,115
NA,lar controls were imposed yesterday on imports,115
NA,from Korea. The Textile Authority reported,115
NA,marked disruption from imports from Hong,115
NA,"Kong, India and China, and export restraint",115
NA,rangements have been negotiated with these act,115
NA,countries. On 11 September 1974 a further,115
NA,reference was made to the Textile Authority,115
NA,the question of whether action should be taken,115
NA,"imports of wool and acrylic yarns, knit-",115
NA,fabrics and towels and towelling. Such action,115
NA,then should of course be consistent with the GATT,115
NA,textile arrangement. I should mention also that,115
NA,a references in respect of footwear have been,115
NA,that made to the Temporary Assistance Authority.,115
NA,The Department of Manufacturing Industry,115
NA,"keeps, as is natural, an extremely close watch on",115
NA,"developments in this ever-changing world, par-",115
NA,"ticularly where international trade, the patterns",115
NA,"that emerge on textile and apparel imports, and",115
NA,the impact of imports in Austrahan industry are,115
NA,it concerned. The Government will very promptly,115
NA,of examine any case of the industry's markets being,115
NA,be disrupted by imports to see whether a reference,115
NA,reshould be made to either the Temporary Assist-,115
NA,ance Authority or the Textile Authority if it is ap-,115
NA,In fact a number of such references are,115
NA,"something that, under consideration.",115
NA,down With regard to the other matter raised by the,115
NA,This does honourable member for Bendigo -,115
NA,"unemployment in regional centres, non-me-",115
NA,to tropolitan areas-honourabl e members wUl also,115
NA,be famUiar with the actions taken by the Govern-,115
NA,in ment. The membership of an interim Structural,115
NA,Adjustment Board has been announced. The,115
NA,employment and retraining scheme has,115
NA,announced and is getting under way. Apart,115
NA,group,115
NA,"activities of that kind, a special working",115
NA,of departments has been examining how,115
NA,might provide special forms of,115
NA,unemployment in countiy,115
NA,to particular firms,115
NA,the board action,115
NA,"contaken for the benefit of aU AustraUans,",115
NA,the,115
NA,that owners' level-th e management side-an d the,115
NA,employees side so that hardship can be avoided,115
NA,and employment maintained. It is expected that,115
NA,year the report from the Government's body wiU be,115
NA,received shortly. It is hoped that the Government,115
NA,will make a decision on it promptly. As honour-,115
NA,able members may be aware from newspaper,115
NA,"reports, two of the Government's Caucus com-",115
NA,of mittees are currendy examining the imphcations,115
NA,of the current unemployment situation and the,115
NA,Government's job retraining scheme and indus-,115
NA,controls try assistance generaUy.,115
NA,It must never be forgotten that imports play an,115
NA,extremely important part in our economy. They,115
NA,not only improve hving standards by providing,115
NA,arattractively priced goods for our people but also,115
NA,as a spur to competition for our local industry.,115
NA,They can satisfy freedom of choice and they can,115
NA,on be a very salutory instrument for containing the,115
NA,to excessive pressures towards innation that occur,115
NA,in Australia and also come from outside,116
NA,Australia.,116
NA,On a related matter-relate d in the sense that,116
NA,was raised by the Opposition-th e honourable,116
NA,member for Wimmera ( Mr King) last night,116
NA,raised a number of questions concerning steel,116
NA,points and shortages of agricultural machinery.,116
NA,He went on to speculate on some reasons for,116
NA,"those shortages. His theme was that shortages,",116
NA,"including shortages of steel, were due to a lack of",116
NA,confidence by the industry concerned. That is a,116
NA,theme with which the Opposition seems to per-,116
NA,sist but which cannot be sustained. The facts are,116
NA,that demand for steel-using products is abnor-,116
NA,mally high at thistimenot only in Austraha but,116
NA,also throughout the world. The major producer,116
NA,of steel points for agricultural machinery has re-,116
NA,ported a 60 per cent increase in production in the,116
NA,last 12 months alone. Recent surveys of manu-,116
NA,facturing activity that have been conducted by,116
NA,the Department of Manufacturing Industry show,116
NA,orders in the major steel-using sectors of industry,116
NA,in the last year or so at levels well above normal.,116
NA,In some cases the orders are double the normal,116
NA,levels.,116
NA,It is not reasonable to expect industry to gear,116
NA,itself instantly to substantial increases in de-,116
NA,"mand, be it the industry making steel points, the",116
NA,steel industry itself or any other industry. In the,116
NA,short time available one should stop and be,116
NA,reminded of the troubles that some industries got,116
NA,themselves into by reacting or over-reacting to,116
NA,excessive demand last year and over-developing,116
NA,their capacity. As the demand levelled off they,116
NA,found that they had unused excess capacity that,116
NA,caused them very serious embarrassment and in,116
NA,some cases considerable hardship. Although I do,116
NA,not see it as a causal factor in the sense that the,116
NA,"honourable member for Wimmera does, there",116
NA,has been a high level of world demand for steel.,116
NA,"The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd has,",116
NA,"for several reasons, produced 7.7 milhon tonnes",116
NA,of steel this year-som e 15 per cent below ca-,116
NA,pacity. The Government has assisted in main-,116
NA,taining and increasing local supply by aUowing,116
NA,by-law entry of some $35m of special aUoy steels,116
NA,of the types used in the manufacture of agricul-,116
NA,tural machinery. So we reject the concept or the,116
NA,notion that it is a lack of confidence in the steel,116
NA,industry that is producing the shortages.,116
NA,Recendy announced new investment figures,116
NA,for steel production also demonstrate and,116
NA,confirm the industry's confidence in the future.,116
NA,BHP has announced that it is seeking cost estiQueensland.,116
NA,mates for a major 3-stage expansion of,116
NA,castle steel works. That cost is estimated to be in,116
NA,"the region of $300m. Recently BHP announced, good",116
NA,"with Government approval, that a $lm feasi-",116
NA,bUity study would be conducted on the establish-,116
NA,it ment of a jumbo steel plant in Western Australia,116
NA,of a size that could be as great as to produce 10,116
NA,mUlion tonnes per annum. The program of,116
NA,investment clearly indicates that there is no lack,116
NA,of confidence as claimed by the honourable,116
NA,member.,116
Mr KEVIN CAIRNS ,LUley) (10.49)-I,116
NA,regret having to bring this matter forward in the,116
NA,"Parhament, but I have made repeated efforts",116
NA,during 1973 and 1974 to finalise something,116
NA,which was brought forward in this place by the,116
NA,"honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Keogh),",116
NA,who has been informed that I was going to raise,116
NA,a matter relating to him. He said in this Parlia-,116
NA,"ment on 12 November 1973, as reported at page",116
NA,3122 of Hansard:,116
NA,He-,116
NA,"That is me, Kevin Cairns, whom he named-",116
NA,"abused every privilege that he had, including using an em-",116
NA,ployee of the divisional returning officer for Lilley- a poor,116
NA,unfortunate woman whom he got hold of and on whom he,116
NA,used his vicious influence to get her to send out propaganda,116
NA,for him and to send out together with the ballot papers for,116
NA,the postal vote applicant a how-to-vote card for Kevin,116
NA,"Caims, the Liberal candidate for Lilley.",116
NA,This was in relation to the election in 1972. He,116
NA,continued:,116
NA,Who bore the brunt of the responsibility for what hap-,116
NA,pened? Not Kevin Cairns. He knew nothing about it. He,116
NA,would not be a party to any malpractices in postal vote col-,116
NA,lections! No. He left it to the poor unfortunate woman who,116
NA,worked in the electoral office to bear the responsibility for,116
NA,actions taken on his behalf and on behalf ofhis organisation.,116
NA,They were the parties truly responsible for such a vicious and,116
NA,malicious political act. Can a sitting member for Parliament,116
NA,do anything lower than to send out how-to-vote cards,116
NA,through an electoral office in order to try to save one's politi-,116
NA,cal hide?,116
NA,Any person reading that would realise that these,116
NA,are very serious aUegations. They involve at least,116
NA,3 people. They involve the electoral officer for,116
NA,the Division of LUley in 1972; they involve a,116
NA,woman in that electoral office-an d there are so,116
NA,few women in that electoral office that the,116
NA,woman referred to can almost be identified as,116
NA,one person; and they certainly involve me. Sub-,116
NA,"sequent to this, through a firm of sohcitors I",116
NA,made a request to the Commonwealth Electoral,116
NA,Officer for Queensland to carry out an investiga-,116
NA,"tion. A week later, on 19 November, a letter was",116
NA,"written by Tully and WUson, solicitors, to Mr",116
NA,"Weise, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer for",116
NA,I wUl not go through the whole let-,116
NA,"its Newter, but this part is worth recording:",116
NA,We therefore request on behalf of our client that you be so,116
NA,"as to make an investigation of the above statements,",116
NA,and advise us in due course of your findings in respect of the,117
NA,following matters:-,117
NA,(a) Is there any evidence that one of your employees was,117
NA,"coerced or influenced by our client, the then member",117
NA,for Lilley.,117
NA,(b) Is there any evidence that our client abused any ofhis,117
NA,privileges particularly in regard to the allegation of,117
NA,the mis-use of an officer of your Depanment.,117
NA,(c) Are you satisfied in your official capacity that the,117
NA,Lilley Poll was conducted in accordance with the,117
NA,requirements of the Aa.,117
NA,A letter was received from the Commonwealth,117
NA,"Electoral Officer for Queensland, indicating that",117
NA,he would carry out an investigation. But he had,117
NA,to be prompted into doing it. A further letter was,117
NA,"dispatched to him nearly 2 months later, on 22",117
NA,January 1974. That letter concluded:,117
NA,"Would you be kind enough,",117
NA,have the results of your examination.,117
NA,I will not read all of the letter. A further letter,117
NA,concerning this matter was sent on 13 February,117
NA,"1974. It asked how the investigation, wliich was",117
NA,"to be carried out promptly, was going. It added:",117
NA,Our client is willing to assist in any examination you are,117
NA,making by answering any questions you may wish to put to,117
NA,him concerning the allegation.,117
NA,"We must request therefore, that you be good enough to",117
NA,bring the matter to a deterrnination as soon as possible.,117
NA,AU the initiative to carry out an investigation was,117
NA,taken on my behalf and at my instigation.,117
NA,"Finally, a letter was received from the Common-",117
NA,"wealth Electoral Officer for Queensland, Mr",117
NA,"Weise. The second paragraph, which is at least",117
NA,"quite mdeterminate and vague, reads:",117
NA,I am now able to inform you that upon receiving a com-,117
NA,plaint of a possible irregularity in postal voting procedures,117
NA,connection with the 1972 Elections,117
NA,then Commonwealth Electoral Oflicer for Queensland,117
NA,"notified the Superintendent of Commonwealth Police, Bris-",117
NA,bane. The Commonwealth Police have been investigating,117
NA,the matter and have advised that the person responsible for,117
NA,including 'Election Pamphlets' with postal voting material,117
NA,addressed to a person m the Division has not yet been,117
NA,identified.,117
NA,I regarded that as an unsatisfactory answer for,117
NA,myself and for the other 2 people who have been,117
NA,accused by the honourable member for Bow-,117
NA,"man. Consequently, I contacted, again through",117
NA,"the firm of solicitors, the superintendent of the",117
NA,Commonwealth PoUce to whom investigation,117
NA,had been referred. Without reading the totaUty,117
NA,ofthe letter and reciting the events that led up to,117
NA,the sending of this letter on 25 March 1974-ove r,117
NA,4 months subsequent to the original aUegation,117
NA,being made- I will quote the last part of the let-,117
NA,ter. It reads:,117
NA,"By letter dated 14 March last, the AustraUan Electoral",117
NA,Oflicer informed us that the Commonwealth Police have,117
NA,been investigating the matter and have advised that the per-,117
NA,son responsible for including election pamphlets with postal,117
NA,voting material addressed to,117
NA,"yet been identified. We wish to confirm that our client, Mr",117
NA,"Cairns, is willing to assist in any investigation of the alle-",117
NA,"gation against him which is being made, by answering any",117
NA,questions you may wish to put to him concerning the alle-,117
NA,gation.,117
NA,"The Commonwealth Electoral Officer was, of",117
NA,"course, informed that we had asked the Com-",117
NA,monwealth Police to proceed with the investiga-,117
NA,"tion, as he had done. That is the last correspon-",117
NA,dence directed to this matter. But about 9 or 10,117
NA,days before the double dissolution election on 18,117
NA,"May a sergeant of the Commonwealth Police,",117
NA,"whom I do not intend to name, acting on behalf",117
NA,"of the Superintendent, telephoned me and indi-",117
NA,cated that the Commonwealth Police had no evi-,117
NA,dence whatsoever in relation to this matter. I,117
NA,as soon as convenient to let us,117
NA,asked him to inform the Superintendent that we,117
NA,stiU awaited a reply to the letter which we had,117
NA,sent to him. He also indicated that neither I nor,117
NA,the person making the aUegation had been inter-,117
NA,rogated. I wonder how an investigation can be,117
NA,made of an allegation without at least asking,117
NA,questions of that person who made the aUe-,117
NA,gation. It stiU boggles my mind. Ten months later,117
NA,"now, late September 1974,1 have had no further",117
NA,communication and no further correspondence.,117
NA,It is not my intention to play poUtics with this,117
NA,matter but merely to bring forward to the Parha-,117
NA,ment the nature of events that have occurred.,117
NA,"Anybody would agree, and I triink anybody must",117
NA,"agree, that a very serious allegation has been",117
NA,made. Wbile I was out of this ParUament quite a,117
NA,precise allegation was made and it was done,117
NA,under privUege. It may have been thought that I,117
NA,"would not return to this place, but events have",117
NA,in decreed otherwise. So I make these comments: I,117
NA,"in the Lilley Division, the",117
NA,beheve the Commonwealth Electoral Offia i for,117
NA,Queensland has erred in not seeking to clear the,117
NA,names at least of two ofhis employees who have,117
NA,been named pubhcly. The employees certainly,117
NA,appear not under their precise names in Hansard,117
NA,but they are easUy identified. The integrity ofhis,117
NA,electoral officers needs to be defended and the,117
NA,integrity of a woman in that office needs to be,117
NA,"clarified and, I beheve, defended. Thirdly, I want",117
NA,to know how this matter can possibly be finalised,117
NA,without asking the accuserforthe evidence on,117
NA,which he must have based those very serious,117
NA,aUegations.,117
NA,I beUeve that if a sincere mistake has been,117
NA,made and if it was made due to incorrect infor-,117
NA,"mation, at least an apology is appropriate. An",117
NA,apology would be accepted and the matter,117
NA,would be left at that. I am not concerned to play,117
NA,pohtics in this matter or to pursue those who,117
NA,have made certain allegations. But if a person,117
NA,does this he should be man enough at least to,117
NA,admit an error if it has occurred. The honourable,117
NA,a person in the Division has not,117
NA,member for Bowman was informed that I would,117
NA,raise something in relation to him and the,118
NA,honourable member for Bowman is not here. I,118
NA,"do not know how his absence is to be regarded,",118
NA,but I leave to the sense of fairness and sense of,118
NA,integrity of honourable members how it ought to,118
NA,"be regarded. But above all, if none of these",118
NA,"people were involved, a pubhc reference to their",118
NA,integrity and certainly to my integrity ought to,118
NA,made. If that were made in terms of an,118
NA,apology- a simple apology without people eat-,118
NA,ing humble pie or being embarrassed-i t would,118
NA,be accepted. It is not my intention to scarify any,118
NA,person but merely to get at the truth. If nothing,118
NA,occurs I will continue with my representations to,118
NA,the Commonwealth Police at least to interrogate,118
NA,me and the honourable member for Bowman,118
NA,and to request him to bring forward the evidence,118
NA,on which he has made his most precise and what,118
NA,I regard as quite serious allegations. Anything,118
NA,"less than that, I believe, would be unsatisfactory",118
NA,and unbecoming a member of this Parliament.,118
Mr WENTWORTH ,Mackellar) (10.59)- I,118
NA,would not have risen to speak except for an inci-,118
NA,dent in the House today which I think I should,118
NA,"draw to your attention, Mr Speaker. I spoke on",118
NA,the postal legislation and I informed the Leader,118
NA,be of the House ( Mr Daly) that I intended to speak,118
NA,for only 10 minutes. I did speak for longer than,118
NA,that but that was because I was interrupted from,118
NA,"time to time with points of order, etc. A few mo-",118
NA,ments ago the Leader of the House said to me:,118
NA,"'Look, you spoke for 15 minutes before those",118
NA,points of order arose'. That was untrue and Han-,118
NA,sard will show it to be untrue.,118
Mr SPEAKER,Order! It being 11 o'clock the,118
NA,House stands adjourned until Tuesday next at,118
NA,10.30 a.m. or until such time thereafter as Mr,118
NA,Speaker takes the Chair.,118
NA,House adjourned at 11 p.m.,118
NA,The following answers to questions,119
NA,Australian Capital Territory: Land Leases,119
NA,Mr Hunt asked the Minister for the Capital,119
NA,"Territory, upon notice:",119
NA,(1) How many blocks in the (a) restricted and (b) unre-,119
NA,stricted categories were offered for sale by his Department in,119
NA,the Australian Capital Territory during 1973-74.,119
NA,(2) How many blocks were made,119
NA,"houses, (b) detached housing and (c) flats during 1973-74.",119
NA,(3) Does this answer vary from that given on 31 August Brighton,119
NA,1973.,119
NA,(4) Was this quantity sufficient to meet expected popu-,119
NA,lation growth in the 12 months period.,119
Mr BRYANT ,Th e answer to the honourable,119
NA,member's question is as foUows:,119
NA,(1) Aucdons of residential leases were suspended by my,119
NA,predecessor in August 1973. One auction was held between 1 Ripponlea,119
NA,July 1973 and the date auctions were suspended. Two hun-,119
NA,dred and forty one leases for detached housing were offered,119
NA,"at that sale, 98 in the 'restricted",119
NA,B' and 99 in 'groups'.,119
NA,"Between October 1973 and 30 June 1974, 1685 ofthe",119
NA,people registered for land under the new,119
NA,been offered residential leases. Of these 1160 have since,119
NA,been granted a lease or are in the process of taking up a,119
NA,"lease, the remainder have declined to take up the offer. A",119
NA,further 1189 leases have been either sold or offered to freeBallan,119
NA,lance builders through a quota arrangement.,119
NA,(2) Under the Nauonal Capital Development Com-,119
NA,"mission's land development programme for 1973-74, the",119
NA,following numbers of sites were available for lease:,119
NA,(a) 175 town house sites on which about 331 town house Meredith,119
NA,units can be built.,119
NA,(b) 3372 sites for detached housing.,119
NA,(c) 13 sites for residential fiats on which about 462,119
NA,residential units can be built.,119
NA,(3) There is no record of an answer given on 31 August,119
NA,"1973. However, if the honourable",119
NA,"answer given to question No. 247 on 11 September 1973,",119
NA,then there has been a decrease in the numbers of sites,119
NA,expected to be available.,119
NA,(4) Leases sold during 1973-74 provide for expected,119
NA,population in 1974-75. The Nauonal Capital Development,119
NA,Commission has advised that it expects that the land made,119
NA,available together with land provided for Government,119
NA,owned rental housing is sufficient to provide for the,119
NA,estimated population increase in the current financial year.,119
NA,Victoria: Electoral Subdivisions,119
NA,Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Services,119
NA,"and Property, upon notice:",119

NA,Australian Servicemen: Foreign Awards,123
NA,(Question No. 507),123
NA,"Mr Wentworth asked the Prime Minister,",123
NA,upon notice:,123
NA,"(1) Is it a fact that in previous wars, including Korea, Aus-",123
NA,tralian servicemen have been given permission to accept and,123
NA,wear foreign awards for gallantry.,123
NA,"(2) Is it also a fact that, prior to going out of office, the pre-",123
NA,prepared a submission in relation to the,123
NA,Vietnam war recommending that Australian servicemen be,123
NA,permitted to accept and wear up to four foreign awards in ac-,123
NA,cordance with normal practice of the Armed Services of the,123
NA,(3) Did Austrahan servicemen in Vietnam gain 416,123
NA,"United States awards and 604 Vietnamese awards; if so,",123
NA,what are the details.,123
NA,"(4) Did Senator Bishop, acting on behalf of the Minister",123
NA,"for Defence, intimate in December 1973 that Australian ser-",123
NA,vicemen would not be permitted to accept or wear foreign,123
NA,awards in relation to the Vietnam war.,123
NA,"(5) If so, was this a break with accepted custom due to a",123
NA,desire to downgrade all servicemen who took pan in the,123
NA,Vietnam war.,123
Mr WHITLAM ,Th e answer to the honourable,123
NA,member's question is as follows:,123
NA,(1) Yes. Foreign awards may only be accepted and worn,123
NA,"with the permission of the sovereign. In previous wars, per-",123
NA,mission to wear gallantry awards of certain countries has,123
NA,been given in parucular circumstances.,123
NA,"(2) The right honourable member for Lowe, when Prime",123
NA,"Minister, advised me in 1972 that a proposal was being pre-",123
NA,pared for the institution of Australian regulations relating to,123
NA,"the acceptance and wearing of foreign awards (Hansard, 26",123
NA,"October 1972, page 3437). I understand that the matter was",123
NA,not proceeded with. The wearing of up to four foreign,123
NA,awards is not a normal pracuce of the Armed Services.,123
NA,(3) We do not have reliable information on the number,123
NA,of foreign awards proposed for Australian servicemen in,123
NA,"Vietnam, as not every case was officially notified. The",123
NA,numbers of confirmed awards ran into some 250 Vietnamese,123
NA,and 200 United States awards.,123
NA,(4) No. The Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence,123
NA,said in December 1973 that there is no possibility of provid-,123
NA,"ing additional awards, either British or foreign, for service in",123
NA,Vietnam. Approvals previously given for acceptance of the,123
NA,"Campaign Medal issued by the South Vietnam Government,",123
NA,"and of several foreign unit awards, still stand.",123
NA,(5) See answer to (4). The policy on the acceptance and,123
NA,wearing of foreign awards for service during the Vietnam,123
NA,war was the responsibility of the Government in office at the,123
NA,Public Service: Coombs Report,124
NA,Mr Snedden asked the Prime Mimster upon question,124
NA,notice:,124
NA,(1) When did the Government receive the report from the,124
NA,Public Service Board of its inquiry into action being taken,124
NA,Departments to ensure that manpower savings are achieved,124
NA,in the implementation of recommendations,124
NA,Report and that staff involved are transferred to priority,124
NA,areas of the administration.,124
NA,(2) Has the Government considered the report.,124
NA,(3) Is it in the nature of an interim report to be followed up,124
NA,by subsequent reports.,124
NA,(4) What is the Government's attitude to the report.,124
NA,(5) When will the report be tabled.,124
Mr WHITLAM ,Th e answer to the right honourtheFurther,124
NA,able member's question is as follows:,124
NA,(1) The Chairman of the Public Service Board,124
NA,this matter on 29 November 1973.,124
NA,(2) Yes.,124
NA,(3) and (4) The Government has not asked the Board to,124
NA,submit further reports specifically,124
NA,"Board considers further such reports are necessary, it will no manent holding",124
NA,doubt provide them.,124
NA,(5) As I told the right honourable member on 13,124
NA,"December 1973 (Hansard, page 4821), the substance",124
NA,Board's report will be included in the Board's Annual,124
NA,Report for 1973-74. I expect to table the Board's Annual,124
NA,Report in September.,124
NA,Fire Fighting Procedures,124
NA,"Mr Snedden asked the Prime Mimster, upon",124
NA,notice:,124
NA,(1) How often are exercises in civil defence preparedness,124

NA,cedures of office buildings in the event of fire.,124
NA,(2) What form do the exercises take.,124
NA,(3) Does he accept that this is an area where the Govern-,124
NA,ment should give a lead to other employers.,124
Mr WHITLAM ,Th e answer to therighthonour-,124
NA,able member's question is as follows:,124
NA,(1) and (2) The form and frequency of any exercises held,124
NA,in Australian Government Departments for the purpose of,124
NA,safeguarding life and property in the event of fire or civil,124
NA,emergency are as determined by the individual Departments,124
NA,"themselves, with whom final responsibility for such pre-",124
NA,cautions rests.,124
NA,In determining the procedures to be adopted to cope with,124
NA,these contingencies Departments have expert technical,124
NA,advice available to them on request from the Australian,124
NA,Board in respect of fire protection and prevention and from,124
NA,the Natural Disasters Organisation in respect of civil emerg-,124
NA,"encies whether arising from fire, earthquake,flood,building",124
NA,collapse or other hazard. The Department of Services and,124
NA,Property is also concerned with the property management,124
NA,aspect of fire prevention facilides.,124
NA,(3) The Australian Govemment has taken a leading role,124
NA,in preparedness for civil emergencies by the establishment of,124
NA,a Natural Disasters Organisation which will provide an ad-,124
NA,equate organisation to deal with natural disasters at a,124

Mr BRYANT ,Th e answer to the honourable,126

NA,"Territory, upon notice:",127
NA,(1) Is the proposed multi-storeyflatprojea in Kingston by,127

Mr BRYANT ,Th e answer to the honourable,127
NA,member's question is as follows:,127
NA,(I) and (2) Approval has been given to a scheme of,127
NA,development subject to certain conditions. As far as I am,127
NA,aware the company has not yet reached a decision in the,127
NA,matter.,127
NA,(3) The project is in accordance with a decision made by,127
NA,the previous Government to permit but not actively encour-,127
NA,age redevelopment in Kingston. It would provide additional,127
NA,accommodauon but this could equally well be provided on,127
NA,other sites recently offered for lease for medium density,127
NA,housing in which limited or no interest has been shown by,127
NA,private developers.,127

NA,"ing Industry, upon notice:",127
NA,What are the Government's plans for the future of the,127
NA,"space tracking station at Carnarvon, Western Australia.",127
NA,Mr Enderby-Th e answer to the honourable,127
NA,member's question is as foUows:,127
NA,The present plan for operational work at Carnarvon is to,127
NA,"continue the phasing out of activities, which as announced in",127
NA,February 1973 began early this year. By 5 October 1974 the,127
NA,tracking staff will have been reduced to one team and the,127
NA,"total staff, currently a little less than",127
NA,reduced to about SO. The single team will be retained until,127
NA,"22 December 1974 or the launch of Helios, whichever is the",127
NA,sooner.,127
NA,Tracking and data handling equipment is being removed,127
NA,concurrently with the phase-down of operations and most of,127
NA,it is being reallocated to other NASA stations.,127
NA,The buildings and service facilities will be almost,127
NA,available to the Australian Government.,127
NA,and Property which will be responsible for the re-,127
NA,"allocation of the land, buildings and service facilities, has",127
NA,(Question No. 684) their possible future use under consideration.,127
NA,The Depanment of Manufacturing Industry is in continu-,127

NA,minimising its effect on the Carnarvon community.,127
NA,Island Lagoon-Trackin g Station,127
NA,(Question No. 702),127
NA,Mr Street asked the Minister for Manufactur-,127
NA,"ing Industry, upon notice:",127
NA,(1) Has the offer by the National Aeronautics and Space,127
NA,Administration to hand over the Island Lagoon tracking sta-,127
NA,tion been rejected by the Australian Government.,127
NA,the worst shortage of accom-,127
NA,"(2) If so, has this rejection been described by senior",127
NA,research scientists as a short-sighted move which is a blow to,127
NA,Australian space researchers and to the cause of fundamen-,127
NA,tal research.,127
NA,(3) What has happened to the 85ft radiotelescope at,127
NA,Island Lagoon.,127
NA,Mr Enderby-Th e answer to the honourable,127
NA,member's question is as follows:,127
NA,"(1) Yes, the offer by the United States National Aeronaut-",127
NA,ics and Space Administration (NASA) to hand over the,127
NA,antenna and some associated equipment and the buildings,127
NA,and services at the Island Lagoon tracking station was,127
NA,declined in September 1973. The reason for declining the,127
NA,offer was that the predicted level of Australian use would not,127
NA,have justified the cost of equipping the antenna for radio,127
NA,astronomy and maintaining the facility.,127
NA,(2) Such a statement was reponed in the Adelaide Adver-,127
NA,tiser of 10 October 1973. It was natural that the dismantling,127
NA,"of the antenna should cause concern. However, it is pertinent",127
NA,to draw attention to the fact that facilities superior in many,127
NA,respects to those which were located at Island Lagoon exist,127
NA,at the NA'SA tracking stations in the Australian Capital Ter-,127
NA,ritory and are available for use by Australia. Over the past,127
NA,twelve months only two Australian scientists have used the,127
NA,antenna in the Australian Capital Territory wereas many,127
NA,more users could be accommodated. The costs to the users,127
NA,(Question No. 701) are small and certainly insignificant compared with prorata,127
NA,sharing of the costs which would have been involved at,127
NA,Island Lagoon.,127
NA,(3) The struaure ofthe 26m (85ft) antenna at Island La-,127
NA,goon was sold and dismantled late in 1973. Most ofthe sta-,127
NA,tion electronic and antenna electro-mechanical equipment,127
NA,was removed for use at other NASA stations.,127

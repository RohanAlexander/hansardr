NA,division of the division of Cook. The peti-,11
NA,tion asksthe Government not to proceed,11
NA,"further with the banking legislation, upon",11
NA,the_ ground that the proposals for the,11
NA,"nationalization of banking, in Australia",11
NA,"amount to restriction of liberty, would",11
NA,"hampertrade and' commerce generally,",11
NA,"and, by reason of the banking legislation",11

NA,and concludes with a prayer. I should,11

Mr RUSSELL ,The : Canberra Times,11

NA,warned the Prime Minister that nation-,11
NA,alization of banking will alienate over-,11
NA,seas capital and discourage migration to,11
NA,Australia. Doesthe Prime Minister feel,11
NA,disposed to reply to that statement?,11
NA,Mr GEIF1EY. - I do not remember,11
NA,having received any communication,11
NA,from Mr Lionel Robinson about that,11
NA,"matter. When. I last saw him, he did not",11
NA,indicate that he held the opinions attri-,11
NA,buted to him i n the report. I had,11
NA,brought to my notice yesterday a striking,11
NA,example of the falsity of claims that the,11
NA,banking legislation is alienating overseas,11
NA,capital. One very large overseas com-,11
NA,pany proposes to embark on industrial,11
NA,expansion in Australia on a scale not,11
NA,known previously. Several other indus-,11
NA,tries are also to be expanded.. I will not,11

NA,Are steps being taken to ensure that,12
NA,adequate compensation will be paid to,12
NA,householders whose property has been,12

NA,estimate of the total damage done? Was,12
NA,the happening due to neglect or carelessI,12
NA,ness on the part of the Army authorities,12
NA,or was i t attributable to the use of,12

Mr CHAMBERS , A t the moment I,12
NA,can only say that inquiries are being,12
NA,"- made into the cause of the mishap, which",12
NA,was a most unfortunate one. Although,12
NA,the exhibition was a little too realistic,12
NA,"this occasion, I can assure honor-",12
NA,members that there is no desire,12
NA,on the part of the A r m y authorities to,12
NA,run away f r o m their responsibilities i n,12
NA,regard to the payment of compensation.,12
NA,I am confident that following the inquiry,12
NA,"which is now being held, there w i l l be",12
NA,I have no recurrence of the unfortunate,12
NA,IMMIGEATION.,12
NA,SOUTH AUSTRALIA N QUOTA.,12
NA,Mr ELTSSELL.^Has the attention of,12
NA,the Minister for Immigration been drawn,12
NA,a report which appeared i n the Adelaide,12
NA,"Advertiser on the 15th November, which",12
NA,stated that the Premier of South Aus-,12
NA,NA,12
NA,Australia is not receiving its f a i r quota,12
NA,of immigrants? Has the Premier of that,12
NA,"State made any protests to the Minister,",12
NA,or has the attention of the Minister been,12
NA,previously directed to the matter i n any,12
NA,other way?,12
Mr CALWELL , I have seen the,12
NA,statement i n the Adelaide press attributed,12
NA,"to the Premier of South Australia, i n",12
NA,- which he is alleged to have stated that,12
NA,r South Australia is not receiving its f a i r,12
NA,quota of immigrants i n accordance with,12
NA,the decision reached at a conference of,12
NA,Commonwealth and State Ministers held,12
NA,last January. I n regard to the honorable,12
NA,member's inquiry as to whether I received,12
NA,advice f r o m the Premier of South,12
NA,Australia along the lines of his reported,12
NA,"comment i n the press, I have to inform",12
NA,him that I have not received any letter on,12
NA,the subject of immigration f r o m the,12
NA,Premier of that State since the con-,12
NA,clusion of. the conference last January.,12
NA,am amazed at the long series of mis-,12
NA,statements attributed to that honorable,12
NA,faulty gentleman i n the newspaper report.,12
NA,He is reported to have stated that,12
NA,unfortunately f or South Australia i t,12
NA,n - looked as though the amended quota of,12
NA,"C,000 immigrants would not sail this",13
NA,"year. However, he must know quite well",13
NA,from the reports of his officers that the,13
NA,"target of 6,000 immigrants agreed upon",13
NA,at the conference in January as being,13
NA,reasonable will be attained. He is also,13
NA,alleged to have said that he had not,13
NA,received any advice of further sailings,13
NA,of immigrants for South Australia since,13
NA,last March. The fact of the matter is,13
NA,that he has been advised of the number of,13
NA,people arriving on Asturias in the course,13
NA,of the next week or so. The number of,13
NA,migrants arriving on that vessel exceeds,13
NA,the total number of migrants landed in,13
NA,South Australia between March and the,13
NA,present time. The Premier has made,13
NA,altogether a long series of misstatements.,13
NA,I wish he would write to me for the,13
NA,information when I would give him,13
NA,the facts. Unfortunately he cannot keep,13
NA,the question of immigration out of party,13
NA,political warfare. I n all my dealings,13
NA,with the Premiers and with honorable,13
NA,members on both sides of the House I,13
NA,have endeavoured to keep immigration,13
NA,outside the arena of party politics. I,13
NA,have treated the Premiers fairly and I,13
NA,expect to be treated the same way. I ex-,13
NA,pect them to make their addresses to me,13
NA,"and not air their grievances, i f any, in",13
NA,the press before consulting me. I t is,13
NA,true that there are some people com-,13
NA,"ing here under the free, and some under",13
NA,"the assisted, system of immigration.",13
NA,"Those people, however, who are paying",13
NA,their own way have a perfect right to say,13
NA,"where they will live. South Australia,",13
NA,NA,13
NA,is apparently not sufficiently progressive,13
NA,to attract them. I cannot be held respon-,13
NA,sible i f those people choose some other,13
NA,State as their place of residence in this,13
NA,country. I n condemning the Australian,13
NA,NA,13
NA,criticizing the other State Premiers who,13
NA,are obviously .much more progressive in,13
NA,their outlook than he is.,13
Mr SHEEHY , I ask the Minister,13
NA,for Information and Immigration whether,13
NA,whether it is true that Asturias is on,13
NA,way to Australia with a. large number,13
NA,"of British migrants, who are coming",13
NA,here under the free arid assisted passage,13
NA,scheme. Is the ship carrying migrants,13
NA,"to South Australia, and i f so, what",13
NA,number?,13
Mr CALWELL ,I t is true that,13
NA,Asturias is now on its way to Australia,13
NA,"with about 1,768 new settlers. With the",13
NA,exception of 168 former members of the,13
NA,"Polish Army, who saw service at Tobruk,",13
NA,"and are on their way to Tasmania, and",13
NA,100 Maltese for whom the British Go-,13
NA,"vernment desired transport, all the pas-",13
NA,sengers are migrants under the free and,13
NA,assisted passage scheme. This is the,13
NA,greatest number of migrants ever brought,13
NA,to Australia in any one ship under any,13
NA,scheme. Three hundred of them are for,13
NA,"South'Australia, bringing the total num-",13
NA,ber of migrants for that State up to,13
NA,584. Other ships are sailing from Eng-,13
NA,land between now and the end of the,13
NA,"year, also bringing migrants to South",13
NA,Australia. I have not tlie slightest doubt,13
NA,that the quota which was agreed upon,13
NA,with tbe Government of South Australia,13
NA,"will be reached, i f not before Christmas,",13
NA,certainly early in the New Year. When,13
NA,we can get ships we arrange for the,13
NA,accommodation to be fully occupied.,13
NA,"In this connexion, a recent statement by",13
NA,the Premier of South Australia that two,13
NA,ships had left Britain with practically,13
NA,110 migrants on board is news to me. I,13
NA,"shall have the matter investigated,",13
NA,because I should like to obtain some,13
NA,further information on it. I t seems to,13
NA,me that the Premier of South Australia,13
NA,has discovered a mare's nest.,13
NA,MOTOR VEHICLES.,13
Mr BOWDEN , I direct the atten-,13
NA,tion of the Prime Minister to a press re-,13
NA,port published on the 12th November to,13
NA,the effect that the possibility of the lift-,13
NA,ing of permits for the sale of new motor,13
NA,cars in Australia is being considered by,13
NA,"the Australian Government. The report,",13
NA,also stated that the matter was being dis-,13
NA,cussed by Cabinet following indications,13
NA,by some States of a desire to be relieved,13
NA,of the responsibility of issuing permits.,13
NA,I ask the right honorable gentleman,13
NA,it is a fact that the possibility of,13
NA,its lifting the permit system governing the,13
NA,-sales of new motor cars in Australia is,13
NA,being considered by the Government. I f,13
NA,"so, is the Prime Minister in a position to",13
NA,inform the House whether any alternative,13
NA,"system is contemplated, and will he take",13
NA,appropriate measures to ensure that in,13
NA,any new system of priorities the interests,14
NA,of primary i>roduccrs w i l l be adequately,14
NA,safeguarded?,14
Mr CHIFLEY , I answered a ques-,14
NA,tion on this subject last week. I t is true,14
NA,that the Minister for Transport is finding,14
NA,staff difficulties i n dealing with the appli-,14
NA,cations for permits for motor cars. He,14
NA,has to use the services of persons pro-,14
NA,vided by the State governments.,14
NA,understand that great difficulty is being,14
NA,"experienced i n New South ""Wales i n this",14
NA,respect. I do not know whether there,14
NA,have been any complaints fro m any of the,14
NA,"other States, although I know that diffi-",14
NA,culties have arisen f o r the reasons men-,14
NA,tioned. The Minister f o r Transport has,14
NA,discussed this matter with the New South,14
NA,Wales Government. I have already ex-,14
NA,pressed the opinion that i n the absence of,14
NA,some system of permits primary pro-,14
NA,ducers and others i n country districts,14
NA,"who, perhaps, would not have the same",14
NA,opportunity as city dwellers to get motor,14
NA,vehicles might not receive a f a i r deal. I t,14
NA,"is the view of the Government that, what-",14
NA,"ever difficulties exist, they should be over-",14
NA,"come in the best way possible, and the",14
NA,Minister is endeavouring to do so. The,14
NA,permit system seems to 'be the fairest,14
NA,way to meet the difficulty.,14

NA,APPOINTMENTS-JUSTIC ESIRWILLIAM,14
Mr BEAZLEY , H a s the Prime,14
NA,Minister seen the alleged statement,14
NA,the honorable member for Warringah,14
NA,which was reported on page 5 of the,14
NA,Sydney Morning Herald on the 17th,14
NA,"November, 1947, wherein the honorable",14
NA,gentleman is alleged to have said at,14
NA,Liberal party meeting at Palm Beach,14
NA,"that "" Federal Labour was determined,",14
NA,"if i t could, to pack the H i g h Court with",14
NA,people whose judgments would support,14
NA,"all the acts of the Labour Government""?",14
NA,Did the honorable member for Warringah,14
NA,make that statement on his own initiaimade,14
NA,"tive, or did the Prime Minister inform",14
NA,him or any other member or person,14
NA,it was the intention of the Government,14
NA,to appoint new judges? How many H,14
NA,Court appointments have ibeen anade,14
NA,since the first Curtin Government,14
NA,"assumed office in October, 1941? What",14
NA,were the - qualifications and previous,14
NA,judicial experience of the judge or,14
NA,judges appointed? I n view of the fact,14
NA,that the honorable member's statement,14
NA,contains the qualification that the,14
NA,Federal Labour 'Government would pack,14
NA,"the H i gh Court "" i f i t could"", thereby",14
NA,implying the existence of some barrier,14
NA,which prevented past packing of the,14
NA,"I High Court, w i l l the right honorable",14
NA,gentleman say whether there are any,14
NA,limits to the number of judges who may,14
NA,"be appointed to the H i gh Court, or could",14
NA,have been appointed during tlie past six,14
NA,years ?,14
Mr CHIFLEY , I do not know,14
NA,whether I saw the particular paragraph,14
NA,to which the honorable member has re-,14
NA,"ferred, but I did see i n a newspaper-i t",14
NA,was probably the Sydney Morning,14
NA,Herald-tha t the honorable member f or,14
NA,"Warringah, speaking at Palm Beach, had",14
NA,made a statement regarding the packing,14
NA,of the High Court. I assumed that the,14
NA,honorable member had allowed his,14
NA,"imagination to run riot, probably because",14
NA,of the surroundings i n which the state-,14
NA,"ment ' was made, because there is no",14
NA,foundation i n fact f or such a statement.,14
NA,There has been nothing to prevent any,14
NA,government f r o m increasing the number,14
NA,of judges on the High Court Bench.,14
NA,"Until about 1912, the H i g h Court",14
NA,"Bench consisted of five judges, but",14
NA,WEBB. in that year the number was in -,14
NA,creased to seven. The H i g h Court,14
NA,of remained at that strength unti l the,14
NA,number of judges was reduced to,14
NA,"six during the depression, presumably",14
NA,for reasons of economy. Durin g the,14
NA,regime of the Curtin Government the,14
NA,a number of judges was restored to seven.,14
NA,The only appointment made by either,14
NA,the Curtin Government or a government,14
NA,led by me was that of Justice Sir Willia m,14
NA,"Webb, who was formerly Chief Justice of",14
NA,the Supreme Court of Queensland. I n,14
NA,"other words, Labour governments have",14
NA,only one appointment to the,14
NA,H i g h Court i n six years. Justice Sir,14
NA,that Willia m Webb was Chief Justice of,14
NA,"Queensland f or five years, and be-",14
NA,i gh fore that he was Crown Solicitor,14
NA,and Public Defender i n that State.,14
NA,He was associated with a number,14
NA,of bodies dealing with the sugar industry,14
NA,and; other matters affecting the .public,15
NA,life of Queensland: He appeared before,15
NA,the Privy' Council as an associate to,15
NA,Viscount Simon in connexion' with cer-,15
NA,tain appeals. I have no knowledge of,15
NA,liis having been associated with State,15
NA,politics in Queensland'. He had in that,15
NA,State a long and distinguished public,15
NA,"career,-mostly in a judicial capacity. I f",15
NA,"I have been correctly informed, the",15
NA,honorable member for Wentworth),15
NA,"in 1942, chargedhimwith biasj",15
NA,but apart from that I - have heard,15
NA,no suggestion of the kind. I repeat that',15
NA,there is absolutely no justification for,15
NA,statement of the honorable member for,15
NA,t^arringali. There has been no discus-,15
NA,"sion with me on the' subject, nor has it",15
NA,been considered by the Government'since,15
NA,-Justice Sir William Webb was appointed,15
NA,twelve months' ago.,15
Mr SPENDER ,-iI desire to make a,15
NA,personal explanation because I was mis-,15
NA,represented in a statement of the Prime,15
NA,Minister in reply to a question. He,15
NA,made it' appear that I had criticized,15
NA,certain members of theHigh Court as,15
NA,i tnow exists.,15
Mr FALSTEIN ,"No , he did not.",15
Mr SPENDER ,"Well , the right",15
NA,honorable' gentleman spent a good deal,15
NA,of time stating the qualifications of Mr.,15
NA,Justice Webb. Addressing' certain of my,15
NA,"electors at Palm Beach, I referred to",15
NA,"recent' discussionsin this Parliament,",15
NA,a'nd in particular to speeches made by,15
NA,the honorable member for Dalley,15
NA,and the Minister for Transport. I,15
NA,reminded them that it had been,15
NA,stated that the decision of the Higb,15
NA,Court on the Banking Act 1945,15
NA,"was a political one, and I added that",15
NA,members of the High Court had been,15
NA,"attacked on the ground of their age, 'and",15
NA,"their alleged incapacity, because of age,",15
NA,to give proper judgment. The only,15
NA,"inference to be drawn from such attacks,",15
NA,"I stated, was that i t was in the Governof the Minister for Information",15
NA,ment's mind to condition the public to,15
NA,receive a resolution in this House to,15
NA,remove certain of the judges on the,15
NA,"ground of incapacity, and to appoint",15
NA,their place nominees' of the Government the,15
NA,who would be amenable to tbe Governtaxes,15

Mr CALWELL , I shall bring the,15

NA,that action be taken as soon as possible,15
NA,to expedite the erection of relay stations,15

NA,coverage of Australia by national stations,15
NA,controlled by' the' Australian Broadcast-,15

NA,stations would have been erected long 1,15

NA,"the post-war era, the cost of many post-",15

NA,"is it to be understood from, that statemenl",15
NA,that the Government intends to continue,16
NA,taxing the public at the present crippling,16

Mr CHIFLEY , I have not seen the,16
NA,statement purported to have been made,16
NA,by the Minister.,16
Mr RANKIN ,H e made it all right.,16
Mr CALWELL ,Ther e is nothing,16
NA,"wrong with it, anyhow.",16
Mr CHIFLEY , I shall ascertain the,16
NA,truth of the alleged statement.,16
NA,"inform the honorable member, however,",16
NA,that rates of taxes have been very greatly,16
NA,reduced since the termination of the war.,16
NA,"In fact, I believe that reductions have",16
NA,even outdistanced the hopes of the tax-,16
NA,payers. I shall consider the matter.,16
Mr TURNBULL , I direct a question,16
NA,to the Treasurer concerning provisional,16
NA,"income tax payments which, in normal",16
NA,"circumstances, I should have dealt with",16
NA,on Grievance Day. I base it on the,16
NA,following paragraph from a letter,16
NA,written to me by a man at Irymple near,16
NA,Mildura in the dried fruits area-,16
NA,"As you are aware, the growers in this",16
NA,trict experienced a very bad season this,16
NA,and incomes were considerably reduced. For,16
NA,"instance, in my own case, which is typical",16
NA,"of others, my income was reduced to Â£220",16
NA,from an average of Â£500. This means that tlie,16
NA,amount of provisional tax demanded (Â£83) is,16
NA,about four times as much as I would he re-,16
NA,quired to pay based on income as shown in,16
NA,my income tax return.,16
NA,In the event of income tax having been,16
NA,"paid, when can a refund of over-payment",16
NA,be expected? I n view of the fact that,16
NA,growers have had to arrange for over-,16
NA,drafts from their banks or advances from,16
NA,packing sheds in order to pay their in-,16
NA,"come tax, will the Commissioner of Taxa-",16
NA,tion repay interest on overpayments by,16
NA,"them? Further, is it intended that this",16
NA,form of taxation shall be continued?,16
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e sections of the,16
NA,income tax legislation relating to the,16
NA,"application of the provisional tax system,",16
NA,were given considerable thought by the,16
NA,.special committee of members which was,16
NA,set up to consider taxation questions.,16
NA,The problem involved is not easy,16
NA,to solve. Salary and wage earners,16
NA,have weekly deductions made from,16
NA,their pay to meet their tax liabili-,16
NA,ties; but the only way to apply,16
NA,"the "" pay as you earn "" system to income",16
NA,I'nrnerp who are not in receipt of wages,16
NA,"or salaries, is to make provisional tax",16
NA,assessments based on income earned in,16
NA,the previous year. There are cases-,16
NA,that mentioned by the honorable member,16
NA,for Wimmera is one-wher e a taxpayer,16
NA,"may receive a high income in one year,",16
NA,and a relatively low figure in the next,16
NA,year. His provisional tax for the second,16
NA,of these years is based on his high income,16
NA,"in the previousyear, and he may be",16
NA,unable to meet this commitment. These,16
NA,I cases are dealt with quite easily. I f the,16
NA,taxation authorities receive a satisfac-,16
NA,tory assurance- I imagine that such an,16
NA,assurance could readily be given in the,16
NA,case mentioned by the honorable mem-,16
NA,ber-th e taxpayer can have the payment,16
NA,of his provisional tax held in abeyance,16
NA,until his income for that year has been,16
NA,"ascertained. I f , however, he pays the",16
NA,tax and subsequently finds that his,16
NA,income has been much less than that for,16
NA,"which the provisional tax was assessed,",16
NA,he will receive his refund when his assess-,16
NA,ment is sent to him. I am sure that the,16
NA,honorable member will find that in any,16
NA,dis- case of the kind mentioned by him to-day,16
NA,"year, the Commissioner for Taxation or one",16
NA,of his deputies will be prepared imme-,16
NA,diately to grant relief by allowing pay-,16
NA,ment of either part or all of the pro-,16
NA,"visional tax owing, to be held in",16
NA,abeyance until the actual income has been,16
NA,ascertained. The taxation authorities,16
NA,of course would require definite evidence,16
NA,of inability to pay. Mere hearsay evi-,16
NA,dence would not be sufficient.,16
NA,POSTAL DEPARTMENT.,16
NA,POST OFFICE FACILITIES-TELEPHON E,16

Mr THOMPSON ,Wha t are the,16
NA,possibilities during the present financial,16
NA,year of improving the accommodation at,16
NA,post offices where there is insufficient,16
NA,"room for staffs, and also of erecting new",16
NA,telephone exchanges to meet the needs,16
NA,of people who have waited for a long,16
NA,time for telephone services?,16
Mr CALWELL ,Som e little time ago,16
NA,the Postmaster-General caused to be,16
NA,issued a pamphlet indicating the diffi-,16
NA,culties confronting his department in the,16
NA,provision of telephones for the thousands,16
NA,of people throughout Australia who need,16
NA,them. He stated the position very clearly,16
NA,and pointed out that in many instances,16
NA,the difficulty in installing new telephones,17
NA,was due to the inability of the depart-,17
NA,"ment, first, to erect tbe requisite ex-",17
NA,changes and secondly to obtain the requi-,17
NA,site exchange equipment. I f the honor-,17
NA,able member has any particular matters,17
NA,affecting his own electorate which he,17
NA,would like me to bring to the notice of,17
NA,"the Postmaster-General, I shall see that",17
NA,attention is given to his representations,17
NA,at the earliest possible moment.,17
NA,WHEAT.,17
NA,STORAGE-SALE S TO NEW ZEALAND.,17
Mr HOWSE , I ask the Prime Mini-,17
NA,"ster which, in the opinion of the Govern-",17
NA,"ment, is of the most pressing importance",17
NA,-th e construction of a guided weapons,17
NA,testing range at Mount Eba or the provi-,17
NA,sion of storage for the record wheat har-,17
NA,vest? Which of these projects does the,17
NA,Government intend to give an immediate,17
NA,priority for the supply of materials,17
NA,capable of being used for the erection,17
NA,of wheat storage bulkheads?,17
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e reasonably ex-,17
NA,peditious construction of the testing,17
NA,range for guided weapons is the subject,17
NA,of an arrangement between the Aus-,17
NA,tralian Government and the United King-,17
NA,dom Government. I have heard no com-,17
NA,plaint that the work being carried out,17
NA,on it affects in any way the provision,17
NA,of storage facilities for the wheat har-,17
NA,vest either in New South Wales or else-,17
NA,"where. The provision of grain storage,",17
NA,"of course, is also of great importance",17
NA,from the point of view of the United,17
NA,"Kingdom Government, as well as the",17
NA,governments of other British countries,17
NA,and continental nations. I f the honor-,17
NA,able member is aware of any instance in,17
NA,which work on the guided weapons,17
NA,testing range is likely to impede the pro-,17
NA,vision of storage for grain crops I shall,17
NA,be very glad to consider the matter.,17
Mr LANG ,I n view of the reported,17
NA,intention of the Prime Minister to visit,17
NA,the Dominion of New Zealand during the,17
NA,"coining parliamentary recess, will the",17
NA,right honorable gentleman inform the,17
NA,House whether it is his intention to take,17
NA,up the question of an immediate review,17
NA,of the Australia-New Zealand wheat,17
NA,agreement with the New Zealand Govern-,17
NA,ment? Does he propose to point out,17
NA,that the cost of the agreement to tbe,17
NA,Australian Treasury during the current,17
NA,year will be considerably in excess of,17
NA,"Â£2,000,000. Does he propose to ask the",17
NA,New Zealand Government for a review,17
NA,of the agreement in the light of the,17
NA,current world parity wheat price in order,17
NA,to relieve tlie burden on the Australian,17
NA,taxpayer of providing a cheap loaf for,17
NA,New Zealand?,17
NA,"Mr CHIFLEY"" - I do not intend to",17
NA,"discuss, the matter that the honorable",17
NA,member has raised while I am in New,17
NA,Zealand. That is an agreement between,17
NA,"governments, and this Government does",17
NA,not attempt to break agreements. I shall,17
NA,discuss a number of matters while I am,17
NA,"in New Zealand, but that is not one of",17
NA,them.,17
NA,INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.,17
NA,AUSTRALIA' S FUTURE .,17
Mr DUTHIE ,Accordin g to a report,17
NA,"that appeared in the week-end press,",17
NA,the American Ambassador to Australia.,17
NA,"Mr Butler, who is now in the United",17
NA,"States of America, gave an encouraging",17
NA,review of Australia's future at a press,17
NA,conference. He praised the Australian,17
NA,steel industry and the proposed Ameri-,17
NA,"can-Australian iron and steel venture,",17
NA,and added that many American com-,17
NA,panies were operating successfully in,17
NA,Australia and many others were likely to,17
NA,follow because Australia was heading for,17
NA,"an economic boom, I n view of the",17
NA,pessimism of some individuals in the,17
NA,"community, I ask the Prime Minister",17
NA,whether he shares the American Ambas-,17
NA,"sador's thoughtful optimism. Also, can",17
NA,the right honorable gentleman say to,17
NA,what extent American capital is flowing,17
NA,into this country.,17
NA,MT. CHIFLEY -I t is quite evident to,17
NA,everybody who has an open mind on the,17
NA,subject that never before in the history,17
NA,of Australia has there been such great,17
NA,economic and industrial activity as there,17
NA,is to-day. People competent to express,17
NA,an opinion say that never before has so,17
NA,much interest been shown in the expan-,17
NA,sion or setting up of new industries. I,17
NA,think the pessimism of which the honor-,17
NA,able member speaks is largely political,17
NA,"and is not real. I have said before, ']",17
NA,"think, in this chamber that a grand",17
NA,opportunity exists for the development of,17
NA,"Australian industries, secondary, cer-",18
NA,"tainly, and, I believe, primary. I realize",18
NA,tbe factors that operate to-day always,18
NA,create the danger of an inflationary trend,18
NA,in the economic life of the community.,18
NA,I mentioned that in the House several,18
NA,"years ago, and I do not want to be guilty",18
NA,"of its repetition. Considering everything,",18
NA,"however, I do not think this country has",18
NA,ever experienced such satisfactory con-,18
NA,ditions for the expansion of industry as,18
NA,"exist, to-day.",18
NA,PETROL RATIONING.,18
Mr MCDONALD ,"A t the week-end,",18
NA,1 found that many farmers in the wes-,18
NA,tern district of Victoria are unable to,18
NA,obtain from petrol distributors the petrol,18
NA,to which their ration coupons entitle,18
NA,them. I t would a;ppear that in addition,18
NA,r.o the ordinary rationing of the consump-,18
NA,tion of petrol by the issuance of ration,18
NA,"tickets to petrol users, there is a",18
NA,secondary rationing by the wholesalers of,18
NA,"supplies to distributors, whereby they do",18
NA,"not get sufficient petrol to supply private at, this stage.",18
NA,users with all they are entitled to. I ask,18
NA,ilie Minister representing the Minister,18
NA,for Supply and Shipping whether the Go-,18
NA,"vernment will try to ensure that farmers,",18
NA,"who have prolific crops, shall get suffi-",18
NA,cient petrol to enable them to undertake,18
NA,their harvesting at the normal time.,18
NA,NA,18
NA,difficulties regarding petrol supplies in,18
NA,utirtain areas. Those difficulties result,18
NA,from not an over-all shortage of petrol,18
NA,"in Australia, but mainly distribution",18
NA,difficulties caused by the petrol com-,18
NA,panies having miscalculated the quan-,18
NA,tities of petrol that ought to have been,18
NA,sent to specific districts. The Govern-,18
NA,ment will endeavour to persuade the,18

NA,that among their members are many who,18
NA,"served with the honorable member, and",18
NA,that they are willing to come forward and,18
NA,testify to his gallantry as a soldier. The,18
NA,honorable member for Indi has given,18
NA,notice of a motion for the appointment of,18
NA,a committee to investigate all the circum-,18
NA,stances of the matter. Will the Prime,18
NA,Minister give to the House an early,18
NA,opportunity to discuss that motion?,18
Mr CHIFLEY , I said last week,18
NA,that I would give consideration to the,18
NA,stage at which the House might consider,18
NA,the motion of which tho honorable mem-,18
NA,ber for Indi has given notice. I think that,18
NA,I also mentioned that something ought,18
NA,to be done personally between the parties,18
NA,concerned regarding this matter. Per-,18
NA,"haps, I am at liberty to say that 1.",18
NA,"myself, mentioned it to the honorable",18
NA,member for the Northern Territory last,18
NA,Friday. I was hoping that good sense,18
NA,"would prevail and that this matter, which",18
NA,lias been the subject of unpleasant re-,18

NA,adjusted. I cannot say anything more,18

Mr FRANCIS ,I s the Prime Minis-,18
NA,ter aware that there is a grave shortage,18
NA,of roofing materials in Queensland which,18
NA,is seriously retarding the housing pro-,18

NA,able gentleman received a letter from the,18
NA,"Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon,",18
NA,requesting that action be taken to deal,18
NA,with the situation? I n view of the,18

Mr CHIFLEY ,Discussion s have,18
NA,taken place with the Premier of Queens-,18

NA,shortage of building materials. At the,18
NA,"moment, I cannot recall specific corre-",18
NA,"spondence on the matter, but I know that",18
NA,there has been a serious shortage of gal-,18
NA,vanized iron for roofing in all States. To,18
NA,"some degree that, applies also to roofing",18
NA,"tiles, and the Minister for Works and",18
NA,Housing has been giving consideration,19
NA,to the use of cement roofing tiles.,19
NA,Every effort has been made by the Aus-,19
NA,tralian Government to speed up produc-,19
NA,"tion, but its function in this respect is",19
NA,limited. Where distribution of building,19
NA,"materials between States is involved, the",19
NA,-distribution has been made as fairly as,19
NA,"possible. Galvanized iron roofing, for",19
NA,"instance, is manufactured in New South",19
NA,"Wales, and, recently, there has been a",19
NA,great demand for this material to protect,19
NA,stored wheat.,19

Mr CHIFLEY ,Productio n is largely,19

NA,Employment - Memorandum showing,21
NA,alteration of Tariff Duties.,21
NA,The memorandum shows the new tariff,21
NA,duties arising out of the recent Inter-,21
NA,national Conference on Trade and Em-,21
NA,"ployment, and furnishes a comparison",21
NA,with the tariff rates at present operating.,21
NA,The memorandum also indicates the,21
NA,country with which each individual tariff,21
NA,item was negotiated. I move-,21
NA,That tlie paper he printed.,21
Mr HARRISON ,Wentworth) [4.2J.,21
NA,-Earlie r I asked the Minister for Com-,21
NA,NA,21
NA,whether he could give some assurance as,21
NA,to when the tariff schedules are likely to,21
NA,be debated. Aa this matter is of supreme,21
NA,"PREimportance to Australian industries, 1",21
NA,again ask him to indicate when the,21
NA,matter is likely to come before Parlia-,21
NA,ment for discussion.,21
NA,NA,21
NA,be afforded in due course for a discussion,21
NA,of the schedules. As the honorable mem-,21
NA,"ber for Wentworth knows, the new tariff",21
NA,rates operate for a provisional period of,21
NA,"six /months, and at some time within that",21
NA,period an opportunity will be given,21
NA,honorable members to discuss them.,21
Mr MCEWEN ,Indi) [4.4] - I regret,21
NA,that the Minister for Commerce and,21
NA,NA,21
NA,a more specific undertaking. He merely,21
NA,said that in due course honorable mem-,21
NA,bers will be given an opportuni'y to,21
NA,debate the adoption of the new tariff,21
NA,"schedules. With all respect to him, and",21
NA,"without, wishing to appear offensive, 1",21
NA,consider that his undertaking does nor,21
NA,"mean anything, because we all know that,",21
NA,items can remain on the notice-paper for,21
NA,many months without being discussed.,21
NA,This matter is of vital importance to,21
NA,many Australian industries and honor-,21
NA,able members are entitled to an assurance,21
NA,that full opportunity will be given for a,21
NA,debate on the new schedules before the,21
NA,end of the present sessional period.,21
Mr CHIFLEY ,Wha t does the honor-,21
NA,"able member mean by "" the end of the",21
NA,"present sessional period "" ?",21
Mr MCEWEN , I mean before the,21
Mr CHIFLEY , I think that it would be,21
NA,impossible for the thousands of items con-,21
NA,tained in the schedules to be properly,21
NA,examined within that period. I t is not,22
NA,likely that the matter will he discussed in,22
NA,Parliament until the beginning of the,22
NA,parliamentary sittings next year.,22
Mr MCEWEN ,Th e Prime Minister,22
NA,( Mr Chifley) has been quite specific in,22
NA,"his remarks, and we now know how the",22
NA,matter stands.,22
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e new schedules are,22
NA,very complicated and will require some,22
NA,considerable time to examine.,22
Mr HARRISON ,Doe s the,22
NA,Minister mean that they will be debated,22
NA,within the next six 'months?,22
Mr CHIFLEY ,Certainly .,22
Mr HARRISON ,W e have had,22
NA,stances where that has not been the case.,22
Mr MCEWEN ,Th e new tariff,22
NA,schedules apply provisionally for six,22
NA,"months, and the governments concerned",22
NA,are required to reach a decision within,22
NA,that time as to whether they will ratify,22
NA,them. I t is now mid-November,22
NA,"and, according to my calculations,",22
NA,the schedules will require to be,22
NA,"ratified before the middle of May,",22
NA,or they will lapse. I understand,22
NA,from an earlier statement of the,22
NA,Minister for Post-war Reconstruction,22
NA,( Mr Dedman) that the Government is,22
NA,required to intimate to the other govern-,22
NA,ments concerned before the expiration of,22
NA,that period its intention with regard to,22
NA,"ratification, and, that being so, it is",22
NA,obviousthat the Government has less,22
NA,than six months in which to make a,22
NA,"decision. I ask the Government, there-",22
NA,"fore, not to make a decision before it has",22
NA,given honorable members an ample op-,22
NA,"portunity to debate the matter, which",22
NA,would necessitate commencing the debate,22
NA,in the early stages of the sittings after,22
NA,Christmas. Can the Prime Minister,22
NA,give the House an assurance that in the,22
NA,early stages of the sitting after Christ-,22
NA,mas,22
Mr CHIFLEY ,Tha t is the Govern-,22
NA,ment's intention.,22
Mr WHITE ,Balaclava) [4.6] -,22
NA,point out to the Prime Minister ( Mr.,22
NA,Chifley) and the Minister for Commerce,22
NA,NA,22
NA,although there is not time at present,22
NA,"examine the agreement, i t is almost",22
NA,unprecedented for such an agreement to,22
NA,be implemented without discussion by,22
NA,the Parliament. Alteration of the present,22
NA,tariff schedules is a matter of life and,22
NA,"death to certain Australian industries,",22
NA,and may permanently affect our economic,22
NA,destiny. The new tariff schedules are in,22
NA,"operation now, and although honorable",22
NA,members cannot hope to assimilate all,22
NA,the facts connected with them in a few,22
NA,"weeks, i t is essential that discussion of",22
NA,them should begin soon. I suggest,22
NA,Prime that they be discussed during the present,22
NA,sittings. I t is said that the alterations,22
NA,of tariff schedules involved in the new,22
NA,agreement are far greater than those,22
NA,which were entailed by the Ottawa,22
NA,"in- Agreement, which were very consider-",22
NA,able. I f the Prime Minister is prepared,22
NA,to give an assurance that time will be,22
NA,made available for discussion of the new,22
NA,tariff schedules during the present session,22
NA,"honorable members will know, at all",22
NA,"events, what the Government proposes.",22
NA,"Major industries, such as canned and",22
NA,"dried fruits, are likely to be seriously",22
NA,"affected by the new tariff schedules, and",22
NA,it is obvious that the sooner the Parlia-,22
NA,ment is afforded an opportunity of dis-,22
NA,cussing them the better. Can the Prime,22
NA,Minister give some more definite indica-,22
NA,tion of the Government's intention?,22
Mr CHIFLEY ,Macquarie - Prime,22
NA,Minister and Treasurer) [4.7] -Th e,22
NA,Minister for Commerce and Agriculture,22
NA,NA,22
NA,"and Housing ( Mr Lemmon), and the",22
NA,Minister for Trade and Customs,22
NA,"(Senator Courtice), and I have spent con-",22
NA,siderable time during the last twelve,22
NA,"months considering the tariff schedules,",22
NA,and I can inform honorable members,22
NA,that they will require a period much,22
NA,longer than a few weeks in order to,22
NA,become familiar with the schedules.,22
NA,In saying that I have in mind that some,22
NA,bonora ble members will be more interested,22
NA,in the effect on particular industries of,22
NA,the new schedules rather than i n,22
NA,their general effect. The Government in-,22
NA,I tends to examine the possibility of,22
NA,making time available for a commence-,22
NA,ment of the discussion on them at the,22
NA,end of the present sittings or early,22
NA,to in the sittings after Christmas. The,22
NA,Minister for Post-war Reconstruction,22
NA,( Mr Dedman) made two statements in,23
NA,the House on this matter; the first some,23
NA,time before the 11th October and the,23
NA,"second on that date, and I believe that",23
NA,the notice-paper contains a notice of,23
NA,motion that the statements be printed. The,23
NA,"""Government will endeavour to afford an",23
NA,-early opportunity for discussion to honor-,23
NA,able members who have had time to study,23
NA,the new schedules. My own opinion is,23
NA,that honorable members will not be able,23
NA,to make a satisfactory examination of,23
NA,the schedules in time to take part in an,23
NA,early discussion of the matter. How-,23
NA,"ever, for the benefit of any who may",23
NA,have had an opportunity to examine,23
NA,"them, the Government hopes to make",23
NA,some time available for that purpose,23
NA,before the House rises.,23
Mr MENZIES ,Durin g that debate the,23
NA,honorable member for Indi ( Mr.,23
NA,MCEwen) would have an opportunity of,23
NA,discussing the effect of the new tariff,23
NA,schedules on industries in which he is,23
NA,interested ?,23
Mr CHIFLEY ,I n a general way.,23
NA,I shall consult with the Leader of the,23
NA,Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the,23
NA,Leader of the Australian Country party,23
NA,( Mr Fadden) and inquire whether the,23
NA,stamina of honorable members will be,23
NA,"sufficient to enable them to ""last the",23
NA,distance in order that some discussion,23
NA,may take place on the motion standing,23
NA,in the name of the Minister for Post-,23
NA,war Reconstruction. I t is just possible,23
NA,that all the schedules may be disposed of,23
NA,during one debate.,23

NA,adjourned.,23
NA,BANKI NG BILL 1947.,23

NA,together.,23
Mr SPENDER ,Warringah) [4.10] -,23
NA,[ should like some information as to how,23
NA,it is proposed to deal with shares held,23
NA,by people resident in England when the,23
NA,shares of Australian residents are,23
NA,acquired under clause 13. Sub-clause,23
NA,of clause 13 provides-,23
NA,Where the Treasurer is satisfied,23
NA,the majority in number of the shares,23
NA,an .Australian private bank are Australian,23
NA,"shares, the Treasurer may, by notice published",23
NA,"in the Gazette, declare that, upon a date speci-",23
NA,fied in the notice the shares in that bank which,23
NA,are Australian shares upon that date shall,23
NA,be vested in the Commonwealth Bank.,23
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Clark) -,23
NA,With what clause is the honorable mem-,23
NA,ber dealing?,23
NA,Mr .SPENDER - I am dealing with,23
NA,clause 37; but in order to do so effectively,23
NA,I must refer to clause 13. I n clause 37,23
NA,and subsequent clauses there is provision,23
NA,for assessment of compensation where,23
NA,shares are acquired from Australian share-,23
NA,"holders in an Australian private bank,",23
NA,"which is defined as "" a private bank which",23
NA,was formed within the limits of the Com-,23
NA,monwealth and the name of which is set,23
NA,"out in Part I . of the Fir3t Schedule"".",23
NA,"Where those shares are taken over, i t is",23
NA,contemplated by other provisions of the,23
NA,"bill, as, for instance, clause 18, that the",23
NA,Commonwealth Bank shall immediately,23
NA,appoint directors to such private trading,23
NA,banks. Those directors are given exten-,23
NA,sive powers in the internal organization,23
NA,of those private trading banks.,23
The CHAIRMAN , I think that the,23
NA,honorable member is referring to a pre-,23
NA,vious debate.,23
Mr SPENDER ,Wit h great respect.,23
NA,I submit that I am not. I cannot express,23
NA,"my view in relation to clause 37, whicli",23
NA,"deals with compensation, without refer-",23
NA,ring to clause 13.,23
The CHAIRMAN ,Th e marginal,23
NA,"note to clause 37 reads ""Register of",23
NA,"rights to payment of compensation"".",23
NA,The clause provides for the keeping of,23
NA,"the names of shareholders, a statement of",23
NA,the number and class of shares held by,23
NA,"each shareholder, and the date upon",23
NA,which those shares become vested in the,23
NA,Commonwealth Bank. The matters to,23
NA,which the honorable member is referring,23
NA,were dealt with in connexion with a pre-,23
NA,vious clause.,23
Mr SPENDER , I am certain that,23
NA,the point I am now making was not deal!,23
NA,1 with in connexion with any previous,23
NA,clause. Under the clauses which we are,23
NA,that now discussing provision is made for,23
NA,in compensation to Australian shareholders,23
NA,whose shares are acquired by virtue of,23
NA,"clause 13. You, "" Mr Chairman, will",24
NA,understand,24
The CHAIRMAN , I regard the hon-,24
NA,orable member's remarks as a reflection,24
NA,"-on the Chair, and-I ask him to withdraw",24
NA,and apologize.,24
Mr SPENDER ,I f .you -so interpret,24
NA,"my remarks, Mr Chairman, I withdraw",24
NA,them. The Treasurer will understand,24
NA,'that the English shareholders in these,24
NA,companies where Australian-held shares,24
NA,have been acquired by virtue of clause,24
NA,13 (1) will be directly 'affected in the,24
NA,value of the shares as the result of the,24
NA,appointment by the Commonwealth of,24
NA,directors to control the,24
NA,banks. Should the profits o'f the,24
NA,trading 'bank's fall below their present,24
NA,levelthe value of the shares held,24
NA,by English shareholders 'would also,24
NA,fall. Since complete power is 'to be given,24
NA,to the directors appointed by the Com-,24
NA,monwealth to control private banks as,24
NA,"they think fit, I should like to know",24
NA,what is the Government's intention re-,24
NA,garding the control of a bank in the,24
NA,"period between now and its liquidation,",24
NA,when its assets will be transferred to the,24
NA,Commonwealth Bank. I want to know,24
NA,what protection is given to the English,24
NA,libareholders.,24
Mr FADDEN ,Darling Downs-,24
NA,Leader of the Australian Country party),24
NA,[4.15] - I should like the Prime Minis-,24
NA,"ter ("" Mr Chifley) to say how it is in-",24
NA,tended to obtain the money with which,24
NA,to pay compensation in respect of the,24
NA,acquisition of the assets of the trading,24
NA,"banks. According to the bill, those assets",24
NA,"consist of property or shares, I n his",24
NA,second-reading Speech the right honor-,24
NA,able gentleman said that it was the in-,24
NA,tention 'of the Government to have the,24
NA,acquisition financed from the resources,24
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank. He added,24
NA,that there was no need for the Parlia-,24
NA,ment to pass an appropriation bill. I,24
NA,shall show that the Commonwealth Bank,24
NA,has not adequate resources of its own to,24
NA,Compensate the private bank's fully. The,24
NA,M'moUnt of compensation has been gene-,24
NA,rally accepted as 'approximately,24
NA,"ei.G0,000,000. The Commonwealth Bank",24
NA,has no resources of its own from which,24
NA,it can pay compensation amounting to,24
NA,that Siim. The Central Banking Divi-,24
NA,isian of the Commonwealth Bank owed,24
NA,BankmgBUlMl. 2177,24
NA,Â£'268j83^j000 to the private banks as at,24
NA,"' the 30th June last. The banks, 'in turn,",24
NA,owed that amount to their depositors.,24
NA,No doubt the amount of indebtedness,24
NA,"has varied, either upward or downward,",24
NA,since then but those are the latest audited,24
NA,'figure's available. Of 'the aissets of 'the,24
NA,Central. Banking Division of 'the Coin-,24
NA,"'mb'nwealth Bank, which 'amount to",24
NA,"Â£438,000,000 excluding the note issue,",24
NA,the Commonwealth Bank has invested,24
NA,"'Â£274,456,000 in .government securities.",24
NA,"I n . other words, mor.e than half",24
NA,of 'the assets of the Commonwealth,24
NA,"Bank consist of government securities,",24
NA,"trading which, in turn, constitute the amount",24
NA,"owed to the trading banks, and, as I",24
NA,"have said, the private banks owe that",24
NA,"amount 'to their depositors. I n ""the light",24
NA,"of those .figures, I ask where the Com-",24
NA,monwealth Bank will obtain .the money,24
NA,"to pay compensation to the trading banks,",24
NA,except by using the assets of the trading,24
NA,banks which they hold as trustees 'for,24
NA,'their depositors. The Commonwealth,24
NA,"Bank, including the Commonwealth",24
NA,"Savings Bank, has invested Â£838,000,000",24
NA,"in government securities, including",24
NA,treasury-bills. As the total assets of the,24
NA,Commonwealth Bank amount to,24
NA,"'Â£1,174,000,000, the proportion of those",24
NA,assets invested in government securities,24
NA,is therefore self-e'videri't -.Supporters o'f,24
NA,the Government have 'claimed with pride,24
NA,that 'the Commonwealth Bank is the,24
NA,people's bank. I t is no such thing;,24
NA,it is the Government's bank. The total,24
NA,deposits in the Commonwealth Savings,24
NA,Bank at the 30th June last amounted,24
NA,"to Â£426,000;00'0. Ninety per cent, of",24
NA,that money is invested in government,24
NA,"securities, including treasury-bills. The",24
NA,Note Issue Department has invested,24
NA,"Â£158,000,000 in government securities.",24
NA,In the trading division of the Common-,24
NA,wealth Bank the deposit's aggregate,24
NA,"Â£74,000,000, of which Â£35,000,000 have",24
NA,been invested in government securities.,24
NA,AH these amounts go to make up a total,24
NA,"of Â£838,000,000 out of the banks entire-",24
NA,5,24
NA,"assets Of Â£1,174,000,000. Now we are",24
NA,"told that Â£100,000,000 for the purchase",24
NA,of trading bank shares will be found out,24
NA,of the resources' of the Commonwealth,24
NA,"Bank it'selL This indebtedness, which",24
NA,the Commonwealth is to assume must be,24
NA,"discharged either iri bonds or in Cash, as",24
NA,was stated by the Prime Minister in his,25
NA,second-reading speech. I f payment is to,25
NA,"be made in bonds, the shareholders will",25
NA,reasonably expect the terms to be at least,25
NA,as favorable as-those for bonds sold to the,25
NA,public within the last six or twelve,25
NA,months. I f the bank draws on the fund,25
NA,"of Â£274,000,000, including treasury-bills,",25
NA,"and pays Â£100,000,000 out of this, only",25
NA,"Â£174,000,000 will be left as security",25
NA,iigainst special accounts amounting to,25
NA,"Â£268,000,000. The Prime Minister",25
NA,should make it clear here and now how,25
NA,"it is intended to meet this obligation, and",25
NA,upon what resources of the Common-,25
NA,wealth Bank i t is proposed to draw.,25
NA,There will undoubtedly be a consider-,25
NA,able loss of revenue when the banks are,25
NA,nationalized. I t cannot be stated exactly,25
NA,"how much will be lost in income tax, but",25
NA,it is certain that the amount will be large,25
NA,and the general taxpayers will have to,25
NA,"make it up. I t is a community tax, and",25
NA,"if Peter does not pay, Paul must. I f the",25
NA,"private banks, after nationalization,",25
NA,"cease to pay income tax, the public must",25
NA,pay something more to make up the,25
NA,amount. The private banks also pay,25
NA,large amounts in rates to local govern-,25
NA,ing authorities.,25
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e Commonwealth,25
NA,Bank makes ex gratia payments to local,25
NA,governing bodies in lieu of rates.,25
Mr FADDEN ,"Yes , I know all",25
NA,"about those payments, but they do not",25
NA,amount to anything like as much as a,25
NA,private owner would have to pay in rates,25
NA,on the same property. There will also,25
NA,"be a loss of State revenue, including",25
NA,"stamp .duty on general securities, bills,",25
NA,"mortgages, &c. We cannot say just how",25
NA,"much this amounts to at present, but a",25
NA,statement should be made by the Govern-,25
NA,"ment on the subject, so that the people",25
NA,will know just what this proposed trans-,25
NA,"action will entail. Moreover, the State",25
NA,governments are entitled to know the ex-,25
NA,tent to which their revenues will be,25
NA,"affected, as are the local governing",25
NA,authorities. There is no statutory basis,25
NA,for ex gratia payments by the Common-,25
NA,"wealth Bank, and they may cease at any",25
NA,time.,25
Mr BURKE ,Perth) [4.25] -The,25
NA,clauses now under consideration deal,25
NA,with the assessment of compensation so,25
NA,as to preserve the rights of the former,25
NA,holders of bank shares when those shares,25
NA,are transferred to the Commonwealth,25
NA,"Bank. These are machinery clauses, and",25
NA,their purpose is to ensure that the rights,25
NA,"of shareholders are recorded, so that pay-",25
NA,ment may be made when the amount of,25
NA,compensation is finally determined.,25
NA,The Leader of the Australian Country,25
NA,party ( Mr Fadden) referred to the loss,25
NA,of income tax which the Treasury,25
NA,would suffer when the private banks,25
NA,"were nationalized, and he also referred to",25
NA,losses of revenue by State governments,25
NA,and local governing authorities. I t is,25
NA,true that the banks have paid a lot of,25
NA,income tax; but they have also paid sub-,25
NA,"stantial dividends, and posted large",25
NA,amounts of money to reserves. The,25
NA,community will lose something by way,25
NA,of income tax which the private banks,25
NA,"will no longer pay, but this will be more",25
NA,than compensated for by the profit which,25
NA,the nationalized hanks will earn for t-lir-,25
NA,conimunity. However. I mn not so,25
NA,"much concerned with tlnil, us with the",25
NA,general benefit which will HCCTUB to the,25
NA,community when the trading banks be-,25
NA,come a publicly owned instrumentality.,25
NA,.Despite all the propaganda to the con-,25
NA,"trary, I believe that the operation of the",25
NA,"banking system, as a public utility,",25
NA,conducted by bankers and responsible,25
NA,"to the Government, must confer benefits",25
NA,on the community that will far,25
NA,outweigh any possible loss of revenue,25
NA,through the private banks ceasing,25
NA,to pay rates and taxes to the,25
NA,"Commonwealth and State Governments,",25
NA,and to local governing authorities.,25
NA,"Taking the short view, however, it is cer-",25
NA,"tain that, in the early stages, the banks,",25
NA,"when taken over, will be controlled with",25
NA,"regard to earning a profit, and this profit",25
NA,will more than make up for any loss of,25
NA,revenue. The Leader of the Australian,25
NA,Country party also referred to the pay-,25
NA,ment to be made by the Commonwealth,25
NA,Bank for the purchase of the assets of,25
NA,"the private banks, which he estimated at",25
NA,"Â£100,000,000. Though that estimate has",25
NA,"been fairly widely accepted, it is, of",25
NA,"course, subject to final determination by",25
NA,the Federal Court of Claims. For the,25
NA,"purposes of this debate, a commitment of",25
NA,that amount may be accepted as approxi-,25
NA,mately accurate. The arguments ad-,25
NA,vanced by the right honorable gentleman,25
NA,were intended to confuse rather than,26
NA,clarify the position. I t is true that an,26
NA,"amount of. approximately Â£282,000,000",26
NA,is now held by the Commonwealth Bank,26
NA,"on behalf of the private banks, which, in",26
NA,"turn, hold i t trust for their depositors.",26
NA,"effect, the private banks have a claim",26
NA,upon the Commonwealth Bank for that,26
NA,amount of money to be paid in notes i f,26
NA,at any time a claim be made upon them,26
NA,by their depositors for the return of their,26
NA,deposits. The sole effect of this proposal,26
NA,will be that the depositors will have first,26
NA,claim on the Commonwealth Bank instead,26
NA,of on the private hanks for the return,26
NA,of their deposits. I n his second-reading,26
NA,"speech, the Prime.Minister ( Mr Chifley)",26
NA,made it clear that the Commonwealth,26
NA,"Bank will, as a normal banking trans-",26
NA,"action, provide for the payment of com-",26
NA,pensation to the private banks. As the,26
NA,"right honorable gentleman pointed out,",26
NA,Commonwealth bonds and treasury bills,26
NA,held by the Commonwealth Bank are far,26
NA,more than sufficient to meet the claims,26
NA,of the shareholders of the private banks.,26
Mr FADDEN ,Bu t not more than suffi-,26
NA,cient to meet the claims of the depositors,26
NA,as well.,26
Mr BURKE ,Th e Leader of the Aus-,26
NA,tralian Country party is endeavouring to,26
NA,confuse the people on this issue. The,26
NA,"simple fact, is that the shareholders of",26
NA,the private banks will be paid by the,26
NA,Commonwealth Bank either in bonds or,26
NA,in cash as they desire.,26
Mr ANTHONY ,B y inflation.,26
Mr BURKE ,Th e shareholders of the,26
NA,private banks are to be given an oppor-,26
NA,tunity to decide whether they will be paid,26
NA,in cash or in Commonwealth bonds. I,26
NA,"suggest that, as good business men, they",26
NA,will readily accept bonds from the Com-,26
NA,monwealth Bank.,26
Mr ANTHONY ,Upo n what basis does,26
NA,the honorable member make that state-,26
NA,ment?,26
Mr BURKE ,Th e large amount of,26
NA,money available at short call to-day sug-,26
NA,gests that i f the total amount were paid,26
NA,in notes the shareholders of the private,26
NA,banks would hold money which they prob-,26
NA,ably could not expend and would be forced,26
NA,cither to invest it on short-term deposit,26
NA,at a low rate of interest or pay i t into,26
NA,their current accounts on which they,26
NA,"receive no interest. Consequently, i t is",26
NA,reasonable to assume that they will elect,26
NA,to be paid in bonds returning current,26
NA,I n rates of interest and saleable at any time.,26
NA,"However, those who may desire to ibe paid",26
NA,in cash for utilization for any particular,26
NA,purpose will be given an opportunity to,26
NA,elect to accept that method of payment.,26
Mr ANTHONY ,Wha t about compul-,26
NA,sory loans ?,26
Mr BURKE ,I t is strangely signifi-,26
NA,cant that exactly the same remark should,26
NA,have been made in 1910 when Common-,26
NA,wealth notes were first introduced. The,26
NA,people were then told that the issue of,26
NA,"Commonwealth notes was a fearful thing,",26
NA,amounting practically to a forced loan.,26
NA,The Australian Labour party and the,26
NA,great Australian Labour movement would,26
NA,never have made such spectacular pro-,26
NA,gress had honorable members opposite,26
NA,learned something new in propaganda as,26
NA,the years passed by. The simple fact is,26
NA,"that, from the resources at its disposal,",26
NA,the Commonwealth Bank will take over,26
NA,the assets of the private banks. The,26
NA,only significant fact that emerges from,26
NA,the speech by the Leader of the,26
NA,Australian Country party is that,26
NA,"the private banks, with compara-",26
NA,"tively small capital backing, finance prac-",26
NA,tically all their operations and provide,26
NA,almost all their accommodation out of the,26
NA,funds supplied not by the shareholders,26
NA,but 'by the depositors. I n that respect,26
NA,the business of private banking is prac-,26
NA,tically unique. That in itself constitutes,26
NA,one of the major reasons why public,26
NA,ownership of the banking system is not,26
NA,only essential and urgent but also pure,26
NA,common sense. The clauses before the,26
NA,committee provide merely that the claims,26
NA,of shareholders under the present system,26
NA,of banking shall be recorded in order to,26
NA,ensure that payment of compensation as,26
NA,finally determined by the Federal Court,26
NA,of Claims may be made to them. Any,26
NA,talk of loss of taxes resulting from the,26
NA,acquisition of the private banks by the,26
NA,"Commonwealth Bank is rather naive, be-",26
NA,"cause, as we are all aware, private banks",26
NA,have not only paid income tax to the,26
NA,Treasury but have also returned substan-,26
NA,"tial profits to their shareholders. I f ,",26
NA,"after this bill becomes law, the Common-",27
NA,wealth Bank makes profits on the busi-,27
NA,ness which was formerly handled by the,27
NA,"private banks, the yield will be more",27
NA,than sufficient to meet any loss of income,27
NA,tax resulting from the acquisition of the,27
NA,private hanks. These are merely,27
NA,machinery clauses which have been de-,27
NA,signed to provide adequately for the,27
NA,recording of the claims for compensation,27
NA,by the shareholders of the private banks.,27
Mr ANTHONY ,Richmond) [4.36] -,27
NA,The committee is entitled to an explana-,27
NA,tion from the Prime Minister ( Mr.,27
NA,Chifley) of the points raised during the,27
NA,"debate, particularly those brought for-",27
NA,ward by the Leader of the Australian,27
NA,Country party ( Mr Fadden). The right,27
NA,"honorable gentleman, however, is follow-",27
NA,ing his familiar practice of putting up a,27
NA,back-bencher to reply when he himself,27
NA,"does not want to do so, doubtless with the",27
NA,intention of replying at some other time,27
NA,"when i t suits him, possibly outside of this",27
NA,chamber. This is a matter of great im-,27
NA,"portance to the people of Australia, par-",27
NA,rir-ularly those with savings bank,27
NA,"accounts. The Commonwealth Bank,",27
NA,which is to be the purchaser of the trad-,27
NA,"ing banks, and has to provide",27
NA,"â¬100,000,000 or possibly much more, has",27
NA,certain resources at its command. These,27
NA,;ire tabulated in its report of the 30th,27
NA,".Tune, 1947, an informative and revealing",27
NA,"publication, which shows exactly what",27
NA,funds and assets the Commonwealth,27
NA,Bank has at its disposal and what funds,27
NA,are available for purposes such as 'that,27
NA,contemplated by this measure. The,27
NA,Prime Minister has told us that the Com-,27
NA,monwealth Bank will provide the money,27
NA,for the acquisition of the trading banks,27
NA,Mild for the payment of compensation to,27
NA,their shareholders. Before he brought,27
NA,forward this proposal to nationalize the,27
NA,"private banks, the right honorable gentle-",27
NA,man must have discussed with the,27
NA,Governor of the Commonwealth Bank,27
NA,the means whereby the acquisition,27
NA,of the trading banks was to be,27
NA,"financed. Accordingly, he should not",27
NA,leave i t to an uninformed honorable,27
NA,member such as the honorable member,27
NA,for Perth ( Mr Burke)-an d I use the,27
NA,"term "" uninformed."" with due respect-",27
NA,to reply to these important points.' I f,27
NA,the honorable member for Burke is in,27
NA,"fact informed on this subject, be possesses",27
NA,knowledge which should be in the posses-,27
NA,sion of every honorable member. The,27
NA,balance-sheet presented by the Common-,27
NA,wealth Bank shows the total deposits in,27
NA,the Commonwealth Savings Bank as,27
NA,"Â£426,000,000. I t might be suggested that",27
NA,the funds for the purchase of the private,27
NA,trading banks may come from that,27
NA,"source, but the balance-sheet indicates",27
NA,"that of that amount Â£369,000,000 has",27
NA,been invested in government securities,27
NA,"and treasury-bills.. Thus, practically the",27
NA,whole of the savings bank deposits has,27
NA,already been invested in government,27
NA,loans.,27
Mr FADDEN ,"Ove r 90 per cent, of it.",27
Mr ANTHONY ,Tha t is so. Pos-,27
NA,sibly therein lies the explanation of the,27
NA,filling of Commonwealth loans. Much,27
NA,jmblicity has been made of the fact that,27
NA,Commonwealth loans have been fully,27
NA,"subscribed when, as a matter of fact, a",27
NA,large amount of the deposits of the people,27
NA,in the savings bank has been utilized by,27
NA,the Commonwealth Bank for that pur-,27
NA,pose. I t is apparent that the Common-,27
NA,wealth Bank has been quietly transfer-,27
NA,ring to the Treasurer money belonging to,27
NA,depositors in the Commonwealth Sav-,27
NA,ings Bank in order to enable the right,27
NA,honorable gentleman to boast that his,27
NA,loans have been successfully floated. The,27
NA,other principal source from which the,27
NA,money might be obtained is tho,27
NA,"Â£268,000,000 which the Commonwealth",27
NA,Bank holds as trustee for the private,27
NA,banks. I n order to make the position,27
NA,clear to any one who may not readily,27
NA,"understand it, may I explain that the",27
NA,"private banks were compelled, first by",27
NA,"National Security Regulations, and later",27
NA,"by the Banking Act of 1945, to deposit",27
NA,certain surplus funds Avith the Common-,27
NA,wealth Bank. They have been paid,27
NA,interest on those funds at the rate of \,27
NA,per cent. On the opposite side of the Com-,27
NA,monwealth Bank's profit and loss account,27
NA,"there is an amount of Â£274,000,000,.",27
NA,"which is held in government securities,",27
NA,"including treasury-bills. Therefore,",27
NA,practically the whole of the trading banks',27
NA,special accounts have again come to the,27
NA,Government. The trading banks are paid,27
NA,"interest at the rate of per cent., but the",27
NA,"Commonwealth Bank is paid 1 per cent,",27
NA,"on treasury-bills, so that i t is making a",27
NA,"profit of 100 per cent, on money that",28
NA,properly belongs to the trading banks.,28
Mr BURKE ,Tha t is a normal opera-,28
NA,tion.,28
Mr ANTHONY ,Whateve r expert,28
NA,knowledge the honorable' member for,28
NA,"Perth may have, a duty devolves upon the",28
NA,Prime Minister to inform the committee,28
NA,and the country. The third method by,28
NA,which the Commonwealth Bank may,28
NA,finance the acquisition of the private,28
NA,banks is that of inflating the currency.,28
NA,That has been suggested by the honorable,28
NA,member for Perth.,28
Mr BURKE , I did not suggest any,28
NA,such thing.,28
Mr ANTHONY ,Th e honorable,28
NA,member said that the banks' shareholders,28
NA,might be paid either in bonds or in cash.,28
NA,Where are the bonds to be found ? Where,28
NA,is the cash to be found ? We are entitled,28
NA,to be given some information in answer,28
NA,to those questions. I f the funds are to be,28
NA,obtained by means of inflating the cur-,28
NA,"rency, that means that there will be a",28
NA,further depreciation of the value of money,28
NA,and therefore a further depreciation of,28
NA,the value of the accounts of savings banks,28
NA,"depositors. Should this Â£100,000,000",28
NA,"depreciation take place, such depositors",28
NA,"will find that a deposit of, say, Â£100 will",28
NA,"be capable, of buying only Â£75 worth of",28
NA,goods. These are merely speculative pos-,28
NA,"sibilities, and I do not know the answer.",28
Mr CHIFLEY ,"Ver y speculative, too.",28
Mr ANTHONY ,Tha t is the answer,28
NA,that I wanted. The Prime Minister is,28
NA,the only one who can resolve this specula-,28
NA,"tion, and the people are entitled to have",28
NA,the information which he can give to,28
NA,them. He must be able to answer my,28
NA,"questions. I n a democratic community,",28
NA,there can be no legitimate reason for,28
NA,secrecy in this matter. This cannot be a,28
NA,"secret transaction because, before the pro-",28
NA,posal to nationalize the banks was for-,28
NA,"mulated, the Prime Minister must have",28
NA,discussed with the Governor of the Com-,28
NA,monwealth Bank the means of financing,28
NA,the scheme. He ought to tell the country,28
NA,what he proposes to do. The people are,28
NA,entitled to know whether there is to be,28
NA,an inflation of the currency by,28
NA,"Â£100,000,000 in order to compensate the",28
NA,"shareholders of the private banks, or",28
NA,whether the Commonwealth Bank pro-,28
NA,poses to use money that has been deposited,28
NA,with the trading banks. Those are the,28
NA,alternatives. The Prime Minister ought,28
NA,to answer me. The country is entitled to,28
NA,an answer.,28
Mr THOMPSON ,Hindmarsh) [4.44].,28
NA,-Th e clauses now before the committee,28
NA,provide for the payment of compensation,28
NA,and the way in which i t will be paid.,28
Mr FADDEN ,The y do not.,28
Mr THOMPSON ,Th e bill is clear,28
NA,on the matter. What the shareholders in,28
NA,the private banks want to know is how,28
NA,they will be paid for their shares. The,28
NA,bill provides definitely that the shares,28
NA,"shall be bought, at the very least, at the",28
NA,"market prices ruling on the 15th August,",28
NA,1947. Those are the lowest prices which,28
NA,"can be paid for them, and i t is possible",28
NA,that the Federal Court of Claims may,28
NA,award a higher rate of compensation.,28
NA,The Leader of the Australian Country,28
NA,party ( Mr Fadden) has referred to taxes,28
NA,and to the rates and charges levied by,28
NA,"local government bodies, but they are not",28
NA,dealt with at all in these clauses. He,28
NA,has said that the Government's proposals,28
NA,for financing the acquisition of the,28
NA,private banks should be explained. My,28
NA,contention is that the Commonwealth,28
NA,Bank is able to finance the payment of,28
NA,compensation. I was rather amused by,28
NA,the question posed by the honorable mem-,28
NA,"ber for Richmond ( Mr Anthony), who",28
NA,asked whether payment would be made in,28
NA,bonds or in bank notes. Would any per-,28
NA,son who owns shares in a private bank,28
NA,from which he receives a good dividend,28
NA,be likely to take a large sum of bank,28
NA,notes and put i t in safe deposit where it,28
NA,would not earn interest for him? I can-,28
NA,not imagine that shareholders would take,28
NA,bank notes in payment for their shares,28
NA,"and not put them to any use. Therefore,",28
NA,the honorable gentleman's remarks about,28
NA,inflation appear to me to have very little,28
NA,relation to this discussion. The honor-,28
NA,able member also asked whether the Com-,28
NA,monwealth Bank would have sufficient,28
NA,security i f shares were bought with bonds.,28
NA,I point out that people who hold shares,28
NA,in private banks consider those shares to,28
NA,be very good asset3. I f the Common-,28
NA,"wealth Bank takes over those shares, they",28
NA,will not lose any of their value as,28
NA,security.,28
NA,The group of clauses which the com-,29
NA,mittee is now considering deals with,29
NA,assets. I f the Commonwealth Bank pays,29
NA,for certain hank buildings and other,29
NA,assets when it takes over from the private,29
NA,"banks, it will be able to use those assets as",29
NA,security. I t seems to me that honorable,29
NA,members opposite are very hard-pushed,29
NA,to find some concrete objection to the pro-,29
NA,posals within this group of clauses.,29
NA,Those proposals constitute the crux of,29
NA,this measure. Honorable members oppo-,29
NA,site may talk as much as they like about,29
NA,"amounts of Â£100,000,000 or Â£267,000,000,",29
NA,"but the fact remains that, when the Com-",29
NA,monwealth Bank takes over the shares,29
NA,and buildings of the private banks those,29
NA,assets will remain just as valuable as they,29
NA,are to-day. The only difference will be,29
NA,that certain people will not continue to,29
NA,derive benefit from those assets as they,29
NA,"are doing now, and that any lowering of",29
NA,the profit derived from the use of those,29
NA,assets will be to the advantage of the,29
NA,people generally. The Leader of the Aus-,29
NA,tralian Country party ( Mr Fadden),29
NA,has said that profits from the use,29
NA,of those assets will not go to general,29
NA,revenue but will be used to reduce,29
NA,our national debt. I believe that,29
NA,"most people will agree that, i f the Com-",29
NA,monwealth has a business undertaking,29
NA,whose profits reduce Australia's national,29
NA,"debt, that undertaking will be of great",29
NA,"advantage to the people, because it will",29
NA,enable the Government to reduce taxes.,29
NA,"As the national debt is lowered, the",29
NA,Government will be able to reduce rates,29
NA,of tax which are now necessary to meet,29
NA,the demands of the national debt.,29
NA,These clauses need not be debated at,29
NA,"great length, because they are virtually",29
NA,self-explanatory. I admit that there are,29
NA,some technical details on which honorable,29
NA,"members may wish to have information,",29
NA,but the general principles embodied in,29
NA,the clauses are set out very clearly. They,29
NA,provide that the shares of the private,29
NA,banks will be taken over at the market,29
NA,"values prevailing on 15th August last, or",29
NA,at any higher value which the Federal,29
NA,Court of Claims may consider that the,29
NA,shareholders are entitled to receive.,29
Mr FADDEN ,Ho w will the Common-,29
NA,wealth Bank pay for them?,29
Mr THOMPSON ,I f the right hon-,29
NA,"orable gentleman sold a block of land, he",29
NA,"would be paid for it in one of two ways,",29
NA,"namely, by cheque or by bank notes.",29
NA,Those are the usual methods of payment.,29
NA,"I f he were paid with bank notes, he",29
NA,would be anxious to lodge them,29
NA,immediately with his'bank. He would,29
NA,not be anxious to carry them with him.,29
NA,"So, whether the shareholders are paid in",29
NA,"notes or by cheque, the money will go",29
NA,"back into banking accounts, and as there",29
NA,will be no private banks in existence after,29
NA,the passage of this legislation the money,29
NA,will be returned to the Commonwealth,29
NA,"Bank, with the exception of that portion",29
NA,of it which will go to the State banks.,29
NA,The bank will be called upon to meet,29
NA,quite a lot of promissory notes. That,29
NA,"is general banking practice, and it will",29
NA,be encumbent upon the bank to observe,29
NA,"that practice, provided, of course, that",29
NA,adequate security exists. Obviously the,29
NA,bank would not accept a promissory note,29
NA,that lacked adequate security. The,29
NA,shareholders can rest assured that they,29
NA,will be treated fairly. I am sure that,29
NA,no honorable member opposite will argue,29
NA,that the court will not properly assess,29
NA,the value of the shares and assets of the,29
NA,private banks. Even those who are,29
NA,vigorously opposed to the nationalization,29
NA,of the private banks can have no objection,29
NA,to the manner in which it. is proposed,29
NA,to compensate those who will be affected,29
NA,by this proposal. No valid argument,29
NA,has been advanced against the compensa-,29
NA,"tion provisions, and in the absence of",29
NA,such argument their retention cannot be,29
NA,questioned. The clauses now under dis-,29
NA,"cussion have no relation to income tax,",29
NA,or to payments to local government,29
NA,bodies. Reference has been made to,29
NA,these matters merely to cloud the issue.,29
NA,The Prime Minister has stated that ex,29
NA,gratia payments will be made to muni-,29
NA,cipal bodies and I am satisfied that these,29
NA,payments will be reasonable.,29
Mr TURNBULL ,Wimmera) [4.54].,29
NA,-Th e honorable member for Hindmarsh,29
NA,"has made a long speech, but so far as I",29
NA,can gather all he has said is that com-,29
NA,pensation will be paid by cheque or in,29
NA,notes. He has not touched the deeper,29
NA,issue of the effect of these payments upon,29
NA,the economy of this country. The point,29
NA,that the honorable member missed is that,29
NA,neither money nor any other means of,29
NA,exchange can be produced by laws.,29
NA,Wealth can be produced only by labour.,30
NA,The passage of a bill does not,30
NA,necessarily produce a sound economy.,30
NA,The Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley) has,30
NA,"been asked to explain fully, or at least",30
NA,"in some detail, how the finance is to be",30
NA,arranged to pay the shareholders of the,30
NA,private banks. That is a simple question.,30
NA,When an individnal undertakes a private,30
NA,"transaction, the source of his money is",30
NA,his own private concern; but when a,30
NA,government undertakes to purchase goods,30
NA,"or chattels, the people are the real pur-",30
NA,"chasers, and the Prime Minister is called",30
NA,upon automatically to say what assets,30
NA,belonging to the people are to be used,30
NA,to finance the transaction.,30
Mr RYAN ,Flinders) [4.56] -Th e,30
NA,reply given by the honorable member,30
NA,for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) to,30
NA,points raised by the Opposition is almost,30
NA,us vague as the clauses we are now con-,30
NA,sidering. There are two aspects of the,30
NA,compensation question: the first concerns,30
NA,the shareholders themselves and the,30
NA,honorable member for Hindmarsh has,30
NA,said'- I do not know with what,30
NA,authority-tha t they will be paid either,30
NA,in notes or by cheque.,30
Mr CHIFLEY ,O r bonds.,30
Mr RYAN ,Tha t is the very point,30
NA,that I wish to make. What type of,30
NA,bond will they be? When the United,30
NA,Kingdom Government bought the British,30
NA,"coal mines, the shareholders were paid",30
NA,in non-negotiable bonds. Are we to,30
NA,assume that the shareholders in the Aus-,30
NA,tralian trading banks are to be paid in,30
NA,bonds that cannot be sold until they,30
NA,have matured perhaps 10 years or 25,30
NA,years hence? That is a. point that must,30
NA,be cleared up.,30
NA,The second point is the manner in which,30
NA,the operation of taking over the private,30
NA,trading banks at a cost of approximately,30
NA,"Â£100,000,000 is to be financed by the",30
NA,Government. Recently the Government,30
NA,bought bank shares for approximately,30
NA,"Â£100,000. We do not know yet how this",30
NA,purchase is being financed and I think,30
NA,"that the public, quite apart from mem-",30
NA,"bers of this committee, is entitled to some",30
NA,information on the matter. The Prime,30
NA,Minister ( Mr Chifley) knows very well,30
NA,that inflation could be caused by adding,30
NA,"Â£100,000,000 to the currency. I that",30
NA,to be done? That is a question to which,30
NA,"the committee should have a definite,",30
NA,answer from the right honorable gentle-,30
NA,man and I trust that he will give a,30
NA,"satisfactory reply. So far, no attempt",30
NA,"has been made to answer this question,",30
NA,although it has been asked on several,30
NA,occasions.,30
NA,Sub-clause 1 (b) of clause 39 provides,30
NA,that persons entitled to compensation,30
NA,shall put in their claims not less than,30
NA,two months after the shares have become,30
NA,vested in the Commonwealth. This period,30
NA,"is far too short, particularly for people",30
NA,"living abroad, whose shares may not be",30
NA,"available, and who may not even know",30
NA,what is taking place. A much longer,30
NA,period should be specified. That also,30
NA,"applies to clause 41, which says-",30
NA,A person who has in his possession tlie,30
NA,share certificate in respect of any shares which,30
NA,have become vested in the Commonwealth Bank,30
NA,"under section thirteen of this act, shall, not",30
NA,later than two months after those shares,30
NA,"became so vested, deliver up that certificate to",30
NA,the Coiiinionweatlh Bank.,30
NA,Penalty: One thousand pounds.,30
NA,That seems an extraordinarily severe,30
NA,penalty for something that may be noth-,30
NA,ing more than inability to obtain a share,30
NA,certificate or lack of knowledge of,30
NA,what has occurred. That penalty might,30
NA,well be reviewed. Whereas shareholders,30
NA,are given only two months in which to,30
NA,comply with this provision and other,30
NA,"provisions of the measure, the Common-",30
NA,wealth Bank is granted no less than six,30
NA,months in .which to act in respect of any,30
NA,"action to be taken by it. Surely, i f the",30
NA,Commonweatlh Bank is to have six,30
NA,"months in which to act, shareholders",30
NA,should be allowed six months too. Ex-,30
NA,"planation is also required of clause 40,",30
NA,which provides-,30
NA,1. Where a notice is not given under the,30
NA,"last preceding section in relation to any shares,",30
NA,the amount of compensation payable in respect,30
NA,of the acquisition of those shares shall be,30
NA,payable to the person whose name is for the,30
NA,time being entered in the compensation,30
NA,register as the owner of the right to be paid,30
NA,compensation in respect of the acquisition of,30
NA,those shares.,30
NA,2. The amount of compensation payable,30
NA,"shall, unless agreed upon, be determined by",30
NA,the Court. . . .,30
NA,That means that the court may determine,30
NA,the amount of compensation to be pay-,30
NA,"able, but sub-clause 3 provides-",30
NA,The making of an agreement under the last,30
NA,s,30
NA,preceding sub-section shall be subject to tlie,30
NA,approval of the Treasurer.,30
NA,What does (hat mean? Does it mean that,31
NA,the Treasurer will have power to sweep,31
NA,'aside any agreement reached between,31
NA,"shareholders, or their agents, and the",31
NA,"Commonwealth Bank? I f it does not,",31
NA,what is the point of that condition? I t,31
NA,seems to destroy the effect of negotiations,31
NA,for an agreemerit i f the agreement is,31
NA,finally to be subject to the approval of,31
NA,the Treasurer. The same provision is,31
NA,"contained in sub-clause 2 of clause 43,",31
NA,which deals with the settlement of com-,31
NA,pensation by agreement-*-,31
NA,The making of an agreement under the last,31
NA,preceding sub-section shall be subject to the,31
NA,approval of the Treasurer.,31
NA,"Why i3 that necessary ? Surely, i f an",31
NA,agreement is made between the Common-,31
NA,"wealth Bank and the person concerned,",31
NA,"that, agreement should be considered final.",31
NA,I! see no reason for the provision. Why,31
NA,should the Treasurer be allowed to,31
NA,"intervene? Why, indeed, should he inter-",31
NA,vene at all?,31
Mr FRASER ,Eden-Monaro) [5.3] -,31
NA,It is interesting to see the way in which,31
NA,this discussion has developed and to note,31
NA,that Opposition members are now con-,31
NA,fining their attention to the manner in,31
NA,which payment to shareholders of the,31
NA,private trading banks will be financed.,31
NA,They have apparently completely aban-,31
NA,doned their earlier statements in attack-,31
NA,"ing this bill, that the rights of ike share-",31
NA,holders will be destroyed and their assets,31
NA,confiscated or paid for at less than fair,31
NA,value. Those Statements were made,31
NA,when the proposal to nationalize the,31
NA,private banks was announced.,31
Mr ANTHONY ,B y whom?,31
NA,honorable member cannot name one,31
NA,honorable member who made them.,31
Mr FRASER ,Thos e statements were,31
NA,made on behalf of. the Opposition parties.,31
Mr FADDEN ,B y whom?,31
Mr FRASER ,The y were made in,31
NA,"every newspaper, over every Commercial",31
NA,"radio station, and on platforms in hun-",31
NA,dreds of towns throughout Australia. The,31
NA,people know that they were made because,31
NA,the statements aroused great concern,31
NA,amongst such members of the public as,31
NA,were prepared to trust the Opposition.,31
NA,The public should realize that proof of,31
NA,the incorrectness of the statements i.i,31
NA,afforded by the fact that Opposition,31
NA,"members, in discussing the provision for",31
NA,"the payment of compensation, no longer",31
NA,make such preposterous claims. 'Opposi-,31
NA,tion members have confined themselves,31
NA,to the manner in which payment is to,31
NA,be made. They appear to have been,31
NA,effectively answered by the honor-,31
NA,able member for Hindmarsh ( Mr.,31
NA,Thompson). The payments will be,31
NA,"made with bonds, cheques, or cash, as",31
NA,shareholders prefer. I n what other ways,31
NA,could payment be made ? To the extent to,31
NA,which shareholders prefer to accept,31
NA,government bonds in place of -dividend-,31
NA,"bearing shares that they now possess, they",31
NA,will continue to enjoy a satisfactory in-,31
NA,"come, and no final cost to the community",31
NA,"will be involved, because i t is the com-",31
NA,munity that enables the private banks to,31
NA,pay dividends to their shareholders. The,31
NA,dividends are paid out of the profits made,31
NA,by the private banks and those profits are,31
NA,made out of the banking transactions of,31
NA,the Australian people.,31
NA,Tbe honorable member for Flinders,31
NA,( Mr Ryan) asked questions about clauses,31
NA,40 and 41. I t is hard to realize what hi;,31
NA,difficulties are in understanding those,31
NA,clauses. Clause 40 sets out the methods,31
NA,by which compensation for shares com-,31
NA,pulsorily acquired under clause 13 shall,31
NA,be determined. Where notification of an,31
NA,interest in shares or in the right to be paid,31
NA,compensation in respect of the acquisition,31
NA,of shares is not received by the Common-,31
NA,wealth Bank in accordance with clause,31
NA,39. compensation will be paid to the per-,31
NA,son whose name appears in the compen-,31
NA,"sation register. That is to say, that the",31
NA,compensation will be paid to the share-,31
NA,"The holder, or the assignee, i f the shareholder",31
NA,"has sold his right, to payment of compen-",31
NA,"sation, or to a person on whom the righl",31
NA,to payment of compensation has devolved,31
NA,by operation of the law. I f the amount,31
NA,"of compensation is not agreed upon, if",31
NA,will be determined by the Federal Court,31
NA,of Claims. I t is unlikely that all per-,31
NA,sons entitled to compensation will agree,31
NA,with the Commonwealth Bank upon the,31
NA,amount that they ought to be paid. In,31
NA,"practice, probably almost every compen-",31
NA,sation claim will be finally decided by the,31
NA,"court. The court's determination, of the",31
NA,amount of compensation payable will,31
NA,be final. So clause 40 appears to .present,31
NA,lio difficulties. The honorable .gentle-,31
NA,man also referred to clause 4 i . The,31
NA,purpose of the clause is to ensure 'that,31
NA,3hare certificates shall be surrendered by,32
NA,shareholders or other persons in posses-,32
NA,sion of thern. That means that share cer-,32
NA,"tificates in respect of shares, for the",32
NA,acquisition of which compensation has,32
NA,"been paid, shall not be held by the public.",32
NA,I see little difficulty arising from clause,32
NA,41.,32
Mr BERNARD CORSER ,Wide Bay),32
NA,[5.10] - I cannot agree that the Govern-,32
NA,ment's proposal on this bill is quite so,32
NA,"easy, or equitable, as honorable members",32
NA,opposite pretend to believe it to be.,32
NA,"First, no industry could be taken over in",32
NA,the way the bill proposes; and it,32
NA,has yet to be proved that under the,32
NA,tution the Government has power to grab,32
NA,shares from the people who have invested,32
NA,money in private banks. The compensa-,32
NA,"tion proposed will be paid, because i t",32
NA,"has to be paid. Were the Government,",32
NA,"permitted to do so, I have no doubt that",32
NA,it would have listened to the extremists,32
NA,who demand that the banks be nation-,32
NA,alized without payment of any compensa-,32
NA,tion. Those sections of the Labour party,32
NA,have been rather outspoken in declaring,32
NA,that no compensation should be paid in,32
NA,"respect of industries, or corporations,",32
NA,"which the Government acquires. Indeed,",32
NA,that has been the subject of a long fight,32
NA,in the ranks of the Labour party. The,32
NA,honorable member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr.,32
NA,Fraser) has said that the profits of the,32
NA,private banks have been made out of the,32
NA,banking transactions of the people of,32
NA,"Australia. However, the honorable",32
NA,member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson),32
NA,claimed that the Government will make,32
NA,large profits out of the operations of the,32
NA,"monopoly bank, and that this will be a",32
NA,means of casing the burden of the national,32
NA,debt. He said that one of the objects of,32
NA,the Government in taking over the private,32
NA,banks is to obtain this profit for the,32
NA,"people. However, the Prime Minister of",32
NA,Sew Zealand has stated publicly that in,32
NA,hisÂ» view the private banks are better able,32
NA,to control the banking system in that,32
NA,"dominion, and for that reason he prefers",32
NA,not to nationalize the private banks.,32
NA,The measure of compensation will be,32
NA,"decided, we are told, between the private",32
NA,banks and the Commonwealth Bank; but,32
NA,any agreement reached between those,32
NA,parties can be upset by the Treasurer.,32
NA,That fact is made clear in the,32
NA,r,32
NA,clauses now under consideration. .1,32
NA,deny that the Government will he acting,32
NA,fairly in taking over shares in the private,32
NA,"banks at their present market value, and",32
NA,I have not the slightest doubt that the,32
NA,owners of such shares will support that,32
NA,"view. First, the present market value is",32
NA,not the true Value of the shares in private,32
NA,"banks, because, since the war years, a sum",32
NA,"of Â£267,000,000, the property of the",32
NA,"private banks, has been held in special",32
NA,accounts by the Commonwealth Bank for,32
NA,"which 10s. per cent, is paid and the",32
NA,"Government, through the Common-",32
NA,"wealth Bank, has had the use of",32
NA,that money. Because the ^private,32
NA,Constibanks have been deprived of the,32
NA,use of those funds they have not been,32
NA,able to make a greater rate of profit than,32
NA,"10s. per cent., whereas the Common-",32
NA,wealth Bank has made profits through the,32
NA,use of those funds. I f the private banks,32
NA,had had the use of those funds their,32
NA,"profits would be very much greater, and,",32
NA,"therefore,' the inducement to the public",32
NA,to purchase bank ' shares would he,32
NA,greater. Thus the value of the shares,32
NA,would be considerably increased. The,32
NA,action of the Government in forcing the,32
NA,private banks to place those funds in,32
NA,special accounts with the Commonwealth,32
NA,Bank has reduced the value of their,32
NA,shares. I sincerely trust that the share-,32
NA,holders of the private banks will realize,32
NA,"that fact, and will seek adjustment on",32
NA,that basis by appealing to any court,32
NA,which may be instituted to adjudicate on,32
NA,disputes which may arise. I have no,32
NA,doubt that an equitable adjustment of,32
NA,the value of shares in that respect would,32
NA,return to the investors concerned a,32
NA,greater benefit than they are likely to ob-,32
NA,tain in the form of any taxation conces-,32
NA,sion which the Government proposes to,32
NA,give to those who agree to acquisition.,32
NA,"Secondly, we know that the Govern-",32
NA,"ment, as it is still doing, took from the",32
NA,private banks d uring the war thG total,32
NA,of their gold reserves and placed them,32
NA,with the Commonwealth Bank. That,32
NA,"action, also has tended to depreciate the",32
NA,value of shares in private banks. I n addi-,32
NA,"tion, the Commonwealth Bank, since it",32
NA,"has become more active in its operations,",32
NA,has been prone to skim off the cream of,32
NA,investments and to leave the second-class,32
NA,risks to the private banks. Institution --,32
NA,whose applications for advances from,33
NA,the Commonwealth Bank have been re-,33
NA,jected include public utility bodies. I n,33
NA,r.liis respect I have in mind various,33
NA,regional bodies which have been set up,33
NA,"in Queensland. For example, the Wide",33
NA,"Bay Regional Electricity Board, which",33
NA,was recently set up by the State govern-,33
NA,"ment, applied to the Commonwealth",33
NA,"Rank for an advance of Â£35,000 to en-",33
NA,able it to inaugurate its operations. The,33
NA,Commonwealth Bank rejected that appli-,33
NA,"cation, but within two hours of the board",33
NA,applying to a private bank for an ad-,33
NA,vance the latter advanced the full sum,33
NA,"of Â£35,000.",33
Mr DALY ,Whe n was that?,33
Mr BERNARD CORSER ,Tha t,33
NA,happened within the last few weeks. The,33
NA,"manager of a local government body,",33
NA,the Wide Bay Regional Electricity,33
NA,"Board, Mr Cotton, applied to the",33
NA,Commonwealth Bank for an advance of,33
NA,"Â£35,000. I have not had any communi-",33
NA,cation with him or any member of the,33
NA,"board on this matter, but I have care-",33
NA,fully checked the facts. The Queensland,33
NA,National Bank accepted the hoard's,33
NA,application and made possible the,33
NA,payment of any part of an ad-,33
NA,"vance of Â£35,000 within two hours",33
NA,of the application being made. The,33
NA,Commonwealth Bank rejected,33
NA,"board's application, although the board",33
NA,was set up by the State Govern-,33
NA,ment and had the blessing of that Go-,33
NA,vernment. That is typical of the way in,33
NA,which the Commonwealth Bank has been,33
NA,skimming the cream off the investment,33
NA,market and leaving to private banks,33
NA,those investments which it rejects. This,33
NA,"development, which has been going on",33
NA,"for some years, has also tended to reduce",33
NA,"the profits of the trading banks, because",33
NA,"such investments are regarded, more or",33
NA,"less, as second-class risks in the eyes of",33
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank. I n future, the",33
NA,"private banks, whose eyes the Govern-",33
NA,"ment is now attempting to burn out, will",33
NA,not be in operation to offset this tendency,33
NA,on the part of the monopoly bank. I n,33
NA,"view of the facts which I have cited, and",33
NA,which have tended to depreciate the,33
NA,"value' of shares in private banks, I urge",33
NA,"shareholders in those institutions, should,",33
NA,"unfortunately, the High Court declare",33
NA,"this legislation to be valid, to seek",33
NA,adjustment of the value of their shares,33
NA,on those grounds by approaching any tri-,33
NA,bunal that may be set up for the purpose.,33
Mr CHIFLEY ,Macquarie - Prime,33
NA,Minister and Treasurer) [5.19] -Th e,33
NA,honorable member for Warringah ( Mr.,33
NA,Spender) raised a question which is,33
NA,largely a legal interpretation of clause,33
NA,37. The legal explanation is that the,33
NA,clause merely provides for the keeping of,33
NA,a register in which will be recorded the,33
NA,names of shareholders on the day on,33
NA,which the shares in private banks are,33
NA,compulsorily acquired by the Common-,33
NA,wealth Bank under clause 13. Any sub-,33
NA,"sequent assignment, or devolution of the",33
NA,right to be .paid compensation will also,33
NA,be entered in that register. I n prac-,33
NA,"tice, a bank's share register will become",33
NA,the register of rights for the payment of,33
NA,"compensation, and in it will be recorded",33
NA,all assignments and the right to be paid,33
NA,compensation. That is the simple legal,33
NA,explanation of clause 37.,33
NA,The honorable member for Warringah,33
NA,made the point that shares held in Aus-,33
NA,"tralia in a private bank, which are not",33
NA,compulsorily acquired on the date set out,33
NA,"in the notice, might belong to English",33
NA,"shareholders, and that the value of the",33
NA,"shares might fall before they are, in due",33
NA,"course, vested in the Commonwealth",33
NA,the Bank.,33
Mr SPENDER ,The y might also rise.,33
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e honorable,33
NA,gentleman may rest assured that the posi-,33
NA,tion of any of these shareholders will not,33
NA,be prejudiced in any way by the fact that,33
NA,the shares are acquired by the Common-,33
NA,wealth Bank at a date later than was the,33
NA,case in respect of Australian share-,33
NA,holders.,33
Mr SPENDER ,N o provision is made,33
NA,for that in the bill.,33
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e point that the,33
NA,honorable member for Warringah has,33
NA,taken may have some substance. I t is,33
NA,not possible to cover in legislation every,33
NA,"detail that might arise. I f , on the other",33
NA,"hand, the shares are not acquired but the",33
NA,assets of private banks concerned are,33
NA,"acquired, the interests of the British",33
NA,shareholders will be identical with those,33
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank itself. I t is,33
NA,beyond reason to suggest that the Com-,33
NA,monwealth Bank would take action which,33
NA,would have the effect of depreciating the,34
NA,value of the assets.,34
NA,The Leader of the Australian Country,34
NA,pnrty ( Mr Fadden) was most disturbed,34
NA,about the capacity of the Commonwealth,34
NA,"Bank, which is the central bank of Aus-",34
NA,"tralia, to take over, as a business trans-",34
NA,"action, the assets of the private hanks. I n",34
NA,"my second-reading speech, I said that",34
NA,that transaction could be done from the,34
NA,resources of the Commonwealth Bank.,34
NA,Sonic people endeavour to raise a bogy,34
NA,"that, for this transaction we must produce",34
NA,"bank notes to the value of Â£100,000,000,",34
NA,which will be paid to the shareholders of,34
NA,the private banks.,34
Mr ANTHONY ,Ban k notes?,34
Mr CHIFLEY,On e honorable mem-,34
NA,ber spoke of the inflation of the note,34
NA,issue.,34
Mr FADDEN ,Th e honorable member,34
NA,for Hindniarsh ( Mr Thompson) spoke,34
NA,of it.,34
Mr CHIFLEY ,"First , 1 point out",34
NA,"that, a considerable percentage would have",34
NA,"to be paid, to British shareholders.",34
Mr ANTHONY ,Wha t percentage?,34
Mr CHIFLEY , I do not know holds,34
NA,whether we have worked out all the deare,34
NA,"tails, but it was a substantial percentage",34
NA,of the shareholders. We shall,34
NA,by in akin g a payment in Australian bank,34
NA,"notes. That is clear. Does any honorresources ""?",34
NA,able mem her imagine that the share-,34
NA,holders of the private banks desire to be,34
NA,paid bank notes to the value of,34
NA,"Â£'1.00,0Â§9,000?",34
Mr FADDEN ,W e did not suggest that.,34
NA,Will the right honorable gentleman ex-,34
NA,plain how the shareholders will be paid?,34
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e honorable,34
NA,ber for Richmond ( Mr Anthony) has,34
NA,endeavoured to suggest that the Govern-,34
NA,ment's proposals will cause inflation.,34
NA,implied that the Commonwealth Bank,34
NA,will pay to the shareholders of the,34
NA,"banks Â£100,000.000 in bank notes, and and dictates its policy.",34
NA,that the country will befloodedwith,34
NA,notes.,34
Mr ANTHONY ,Eve n if the sharenot,34
NA,"holders are paid by cheque, the result will",34
NA,still be inflation.,34
Mr CHIFLEY ,Tha t is the honorCommonwealth,34
NA,able member's implication. During the,34
NA,"last twelve months, in Australia,",34
NA,made by banks have increased by,34
NA,"Â£100,000,000. Does the honorable mem-",34
NA,ber suggest that that was inflation?,34
Mr FADDEN ,No t i f that amount were,34
NA,met by production. That is the greatest,34
NA,safeguard. What is the Government,34
NA,doing to increase production?,34
Mr MENZIES , The Government' -,34
NA,banking proposals will not increase pro-,34
NA,duction.,34
Mr CHIFLEY ,Withou t any protest*,34
NA,"from honorable members opposite, tin-",34
NA,amount of increased advances made by,34
NA,banks during the last twelve months wa -,34
NA,"Â£100,000,000.",34
Mr ANTHONY ,Wa s not the figure,34
NA,"Â£79,000,000? The Commonwealth Bank",34
NA,"stated in"" its report that the peak has",34
NA,been reached.,34
Mr CHIFLEY ,Thos e increased,34
NA,advances have been made during the last,34
NA,twelve months. One does not know what,34
NA,"the shareholders of the private banks, in-",34
NA,"cluding the British shareholders, mighi",34
NA,"want. At all events, I do not imagine",34
NA,that they will want to be paid with bank,34
NA,notes. The Commonwealth Bank itself,34
NA,"a certain amount of securities, whicli",34
NA,its own property and assets. I t has,34
NA,"other resources. First, i t is the central",34
NA,"not, begin - bank of Australia.",34
Mr FADDEN ,"Wha t are those "" other",34
Mr CHIFLEY , I could ask the,34
NA,"right, honorable gentleman the same",34
NA,question about the resources of the private,34
NA,banks.,34
Mr FADDEN , I am not under an obli-,34
NA,gation to tell the right honorable gentle-,34
NA,"man, but he is under an obligation to tell",34
NA,memme. That is the difference.,34
Mr CHIFLEY ,Som e honorable,34
NA,He members always complain that the,34
NA,Government interferes with the con-,34
NA,"private duct of the Commonwealth Bank,",34
NA,We have,34
NA,Â£1 an assurance from the Common-,34
NA,wealth Bank that the assets which i t is,34
NA,taking over are tangible assets. They are,34
NA,something which might disappear,34
NA,"overnight. These are tangible assets, and",34
NA,"from them, within its own resources, the",34
NA,Bank is able to handle,34
NA,this business as a financial deal. That is,34
NA,advances the plain fact of the matter.,34
Mr FADDEN ,Th e taking over of fixed,35
NA,assets does not give the liquid resources,35
NA,with which to liquidate the liability.,35
Mr CHIFLEY ,Ther e is nothing in,35
NA,that contention. Reference has been made,35
NA,to the special deposit account held by the,35
NA,"Commonwealth Bank. I n this account,",35
NA,the surplus funds of the private bank3,35
NA,are retained. The right honorable gentle-,35
NA,"man himself agreed to that principle,",35
NA,although he did not believe in its.being,35
NA,made law. He believed in a voluntary,35
NA,arrangement with the private banks.,35
Mr FADDEN ,W e should have made,35
NA,that provision law i f the private banks,35
NA,had not agreed to the arrangement.,35
Mr CHIFLEY , I incorporated that,35
NA,provision in the act for the right honor-,35
NA,able gentleman. A large amount of this,35
NA,money in the special account has come,35
NA,from current accounts on which the pri-,35
NA,vate banks do not pay interest. Any sug-,35
NA,"gestion that the Commonwealth Bank,",35
NA,"to-morrow, will not be able to return to",35
NA,the private banks any of the money which,35
NA,"has been lodged with it, and meet any of",35
NA,"the commitments which it might have, not",35
NA,"only to its own depositors, but also to the",35
NA,"depositors of the private banks, is wrong.",35
NA,The truth is that the banking legislation,35
NA,of 1945 created a precedent in the finan-,35
NA,cial history of the British Empire. I t,35
NA,gave to the people of Australia a guaran-,35
NA,tee that all depositors would receive their,35
NA,"money on demand, even i f those deposits",35
NA,were held in a private bank which had,35
NA,"gone into liquidation. I n effect, the",35
NA,Labour Government was the first govern-,35
NA,ment of any country which gave to,35
NA,depositors a guarantee that their,35
NA,interests would be protected. I t is,35
NA,true that we did not give a guarantee,35
NA,"to shareholders. However, for any one",35
NA,"to suggest, as the honorable member for",35
NA,"Richmond did, that the depositors in",35
NA,banks were likely to feel that they would,35
NA,not receive full value for their money or,35
NA,that they might be paid in depreciated,35
NA,"currency, was quite absurd. Subject",35
NA,"to the legislation being valid, about",35
NA,"which there may be some doubt, the",35
NA,Government has endeavoured to give to,35
NA,those people who have deposited money,35
NA,with private banking institutions what,35
NA,is in effect a guarantee that they will,35
NA,not lose their money.,35
Mr ANTHONY ,I f the currency is,35
NA,inflated their assets must depreciate.,35
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e honorable mem-,35
NA,ber for Richmond should not talk non-,35
NA,sense about the depreciation of the,35
NA,Australian currency. I f I may make,35
NA,"passing reference to this matter, I point",35
NA,out to him that the Australian Â£1 has,35
NA,"40 per cent, more purchasing power in-",35
NA,ternally than British sterling and 60 per,35
NA,"cent, more purchasing power internally",35
NA,than the American dollar. On the basis,35
NA,"of sound financial practice, the Ausr",35
NA,tralian Â£1 is one of the few currencies,35
NA,"in the world which, from a mathematical",35
NA,"point of view, could be appreciated. That",35
NA,is a fact which causes the honorable,35
NA,member for New England ( Mr Abbott),35
NA,to shiver in his shoes whenever he thinks,35
NA,about it. The honorable member knows,35
NA,that under the law of supply and de-,35
NA,mand the Australian Â£1 has greater value,35
NA,than almost any other currency in the,35
NA,world. He knows what would happen i f,35
NA,that law were put into operation.,35
Mr ABBOTT , I do not know what will,35
NA,happen when the Government has finished,35
NA,with its banking proposals.,35
Mr CHIFLEY ,Th e honorable mem-,35
NA,ber has been saying things about me for,35
NA,six years. Suggestions have been made,35
NA,"that something the Government has done,",35
NA,"or is likely to do, will render the Aus-",35
NA,tralian currency less valuable. There is,35
NA,no justification for that fear. The Aus-,35
NA,tralian currency could be appreciated.,35
NA,What I have said applies to the private,35
NA,trading banks as well as to the Common-,35
NA,wealth Bank.,35
Mr ANTHONY ,Ho w much is the dol-,35
NA,lar worth now?,35
Mr CHIFLEY ,Ther e is no need for,35
NA,the honorable member to tell me that,35
NA,when the Americans came here they knew,35
NA,what the value of the dollar was in Aus-,35
NA,tralia compared with its value in their,35
NA,own country.,35
Mr ANTHONY ,Wha t is the Aus-,35
NA,tralian Â£1 worth in the United States,35
NA,of America?,35
Mr CHIFLEY ,O n a sterling basis,35
NA,"it would be worth a lot, but any attempt",35
NA,to establish wch a basis would meet with,35
NA,violent opposition from members of the,35
NA,"Australian Country party. Indeed, they",35
NA,would set up such a howl that the roof,36
NA,this building would be in danger of being,36
NA,lifted.,36
Mr FADDEN ,Doe s the Government,36
NA,intend to do that?,36
Mr CHIFLEY , I am something of,36
NA,a realist. I f the Government had taken,36
NA,the stand frequently taken by bankers,36
NA,"the years gone by, those are the things",36
NA,that it would have done. The only,36
NA,plaint that I have heard about the Comsame,36
NA,monwealth Bank while 1 have been,36
NA,Treasurer has been that its ex gratia,36
NA,payments to local governing bodies have this clause.,36
NA,not given satisfaction. The bank,36
NA,denies that that complaint is justified.,36
Mr FADDEN ,Peopl e know that it,36
NA,no use complaining to the right honorable,36
NA,gentleman.,36
Mr CHIFLEY ,I t has been said,36
NA,that the profits made by the Commonchoose,36
NA,wealth Bank go into the sinking fund.,36
NA,The money paid into that fund must,36
NA,come out of revenue. Reference has,36

NA,has ever known is the internal exchange opposite.,36
NA,on cheques charged by banks. Both the,36
NA,honorable member for New England and,36
NA,I have been interested in that subject,36
NA,for several years. I merely mention,36
NA,these subjects in passing.,36
Mr MENZIES ,"""Wh y not make a passing",36
NA,ing reference to the bill?,36
Mr CHIFLEY , I thought that I had,36
NA,done so. I was replying to some of the,36
NA,statements made by the honorable memment,36
NA,"ber for Wide Bay ( Mr Corser), who",36
NA,covered a wide field in his remarks. of the private banks.,36
NA,"However, as that honorable member is",36
NA,"member of the Australian Country party,",36
NA,I realize that the Leader of the OpposiParliament,36

NA,"I rose chiefly to say, first,",36
NA,"Commonwealth Bank, from its own Commonwealth",36

NA,completely clear that shareholders of what,36
NA,"banks, whether in England, or Australia,",36
NA,will get justice. They may enter into,36
NA,"voluntary agreement, or they may",36

NA,of all very well for honorable members,36
NA,opposite to sneer about the courts. That,36
NA,is one of the things about which com-,36
NA,plaints have been made recently. I could,36
NA,give the committee some of the history,36
NA,"of appointments to courts in Australia,",36
NA,but I have never been one to cast reflec-,36
NA,tions on judges. Whatever their back-,36
NA,"in ground has been, I have not doubted the",36

Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Barker),36
NA,[5.40] -Th e Prime Minister ( Mr.,36
NA,Chifley) made two points: The first was,36
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank would take,36
NA,over the shares in the private banks pay-,36
NA,for them out of its own assets. The,36
NA,second was that the shareholders would,36
NA,get justice provided they did not go to,36
NA,the court and ask for it. The Govern-,36
NA,is relying upon the Constitution,36
NA,for authority to acquire the assets,36
NA,The Con-,36
NA,a stitution gives this Parliament cer-,36
NA,"tain powers, hut it does not give the",36
NA,authority to delegate those,36
NA,nor does it authorize any,36
NA,"authority, governmental, semi-govern-",36
NA,"mental or private, to usurp the powers",36
NA,that the conferred by the Constitution,36
NA,Constitution. The,36
NA,Act,36
NA,authorizes the Government to acquire,36
NA,any property from any State or person,36
NA,t on just terms; but I do not believe that,36
NA,the Government is now proposing,36
NA,to do represents a proper exercise of its,36
NA,a powers of acquisition. As for what the,36
NA,go Government proposes to do by way of,36
NA,"compensating shareholders, I say that the",36
NA,Australian Government has,37
NA,"authority, either legally or morally, to",37
NA,tell the Commonwealth Bank or anybody,37
NA,else to pay for property acquired by the,37
NA,Commonwealth. I f the Commonwealth,37
NA,"acquires property on just terms, it, stands",37
NA,"to reason that it, must pay for the",37
NA,property out of assets belonging to the,37
NA,Commonwealth itself. There must be an,37
NA,exchange of something of value owned by,37
NA,the Commonwealth for something of,37
NA,"vnlue which it, is taking away from the",37
NA,"citizen. I n the present instance, accord-",37
NA,"ing to the statement, of the Prime Minis-",37
NA,"ter, it is proposed to pay the shareholders",37
NA,"t>f the private hunks out, of assets which",37
NA,the Commonwealth Bank already,37
NA,possesses. The Prime Minister does not,37
NA,claim that these assets are the property,37
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank. As a,37
NA,"matter of fact, we know that the total",37
NA,capital of the Commonwealth Bank is,37
NA,"only just a little over Â£16,000,000, and",37
NA,yet it is proposed that the Commonwealth,37
NA,"Bank shall acquire Â£100,000,000 worth",37
NA,"of other people's assets. I n other words,",37
NA,without an appropriation by the Parlia-,37
NA,"ment, without the imposition of taxes,",37
NA,"without raising loans, and, thank God,",37
NA,without any'suggestion of inflation by in-,37
NA,"creasing the note issue, the Government",37
NA,"proposes to get hold of Â£100,000,000",37
NA,worth of other people's goods.,37
NA,"The late Sir Henry Morgan, a",37
NA,famous seaman who operated on the,37
NA,Spanish Main before he became respect-,37
NA,able and was appointed Governor of,37
NA,"Jamaica, would have been very envious",37
NA,nf the Australian Government be-,37
NA,"cause, during the whole period of his",37
NA,"depredations, ho never took from the",37
NA,Spaniards oue fraction of what this Go-,37
NA,vernment is getting out of the share-,37
NA,holders of the private banks. There has,37
NA,been talk of the soundness of the cur-,37
NA,"rency, and of maintaining the purchasing",37
NA,power of the Â£1. I do not know,37
NA,"whether any one mentioned ""Fisher's",37
NA,"rlimsies"". If not. I will do so now.",37
NA,"When the Fisher Government took over,",37
NA,honorable members who preceded me as,37
NA,the representatives of political parties,37
NA,"now on this side of the House, called",37
NA,the notes issued by the Commonwealth,37
NA,""" Fisher's flimsies"". A better title",37
NA,was never invented. At the time those,37
NA,"notes were first issued, they bore a",37
NA,Mr Archie Cameron.,37
NA,no printed declaration that they could be ex-,37
NA,changed at the Commonwealth Treasury,37
NA,"for one golden, sovereign. Not very long",37
NA,"afterwards, a sovereign was worth 25s.",37
NA,That was the beginning of a process by,37
NA,which the Australian Â£1 note has,37
NA,approximated more and more in value to,37
NA,that of a. piece of very ordinary ipaper.,37
NA,This process has continued until to-day,37
NA,the Australian sovereign-an d some of us,37
NA,"still keep one or two as souvenirs, not-",37
NA,withstanding the regulations-i s worth,37
NA,Â£2 12s. 6d. in Australian notes. I ask,37
NA,"members of tbe Government, and their",37
NA,loquacious supporters who are trying to,37
NA,talk themselvesout of the bog in which,37
NA,"they are stuck, whether they want the",37
NA,Australian Â£1 note to become even more,37
NA,flimsy than it is. I address myself par-,37
NA,ticularly to the honorable member for,37
NA,"Eden-Monaro ( Mr Fraser), who seemed",37
NA,to doubt that honorable members would,37
NA,"take up the challenge about "" Fisher's",37
NA,"flimsies "". There must be something in",37
NA,"historical association, after all. I recall",37
NA,"that Simon Fraser, who was Lord Lovat,",37
NA,"sent his son to Culloden, while he himself",37
NA,was maintaining close contact with the,37
NA,British Government. The honorable,37
NA,member for Eden-Monaro would also like,37
NA,to have it both ways. He would like to,37
NA,argue in favour of the soundness of the,37
NA,"currency, whilst supporting a proposal",37
NA,"to acquire Â£100,000,000 worth of assets",37
NA,merely by making an entry in the books,37
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank. An honor-,37
NA,able member of his attainments is fully,37
NA,entitled to entertain such ambitions i f,37
NA,"he wants to, but whether they will he",37
NA,satisfied is another matter. So much for,37
NA,""" Fisher'sflimsies"".",37
NA,"As I have said, the Government pro-",37
NA,"poses to take over Â£100,000,000 of assets",37
NA,without appropriating one penny piece,37
NA,of the money of the Australian taxpayers.,37
NA,Those taxpayers are to benefit to the,37
NA,"extent of Â£100,000,000-ou t of nothing.",37
NA,A more immoral proposition was never,37
NA,put up in this Parliament. I f the Go-,37
NA,"vernment can get away with this, there is",37
NA,no earthly reason why the same formula,37
NA,should not be applied to every other big,37
NA,husiness in the country. There is no,37
NA,institution in Australia with assets as,37
NA,great as the combined assets of the as-,37
NA,"sociated banks, not even Broken Hill",37
NA,Proprietary Company Limited. Pro-,37
NA,"bably, the next thing we shall know is",37
NA,that a bill will be brought down declaring,38
NA,"that, when the act is proclaimed, all the",38
NA,assets of Broken H i l l Proprietary sation,38
NA,"Company Limited shall be taken over,",38
NA,be paid for out of the assets of the,38
NA,monwealth Bank. There will be no,38
NA,"propriation by the Parliament, and no",38
NA,will be imposed f or the purpose. One,38
NA,"the weaknesses of this bill, which w i l",38
NA,"show up f a i r l y soon I think, is that",38
NA,provision is made f o r the appropriation,38
NA,of money. I t is not possible to compensate,38
NA,"on just, terms any person whose property",38
NA,the Government takes over unless there is this measure.,38
NA,an appropriation of Commonwealth assets,38
NA,for the purpose. The assets of the Com-,38
NA,"monwealth Bank, which are to be used",38
NA,"r,o compensate shareholders i n the private",38
NA,"banks, consist largely of compulsory",38
NA,lodgments by the private banks. Two,38
NA,"years ago, when the Commonwealth Bank",38
NA,"Bill was before the Parliament, I dethis",38
NA,clared that i t was untenable i n law,38
NA,make the private banks hand over their,38
NA,deposits to the Commonwealth Bank. member f o r Barker,38
NA,These moneys were placed i n the hands,38
NA,the Commonwealth Bank as the result of,38
NA,the greatest act of highway robbery,38
NA,have ever known. Behind the compulsion,38
NA,on the private banks to deposit a prothe Government.,38
NA,portion of their surplus funds with the,38
NA,Commonwealth Bank lies a story not,38
NA,"unlike that of Robin Hood, who always",38
NA,financed his debts to the poor,38
NA,laying merchants and bishops and reliev-,38
NA,ing them of their wealth. I t is fortunate,38
NA,indeed for the honorable member f o,38
NA,Watson ( Mr Falstein) that he was,38
NA,alive i n those days; otherwise he might,38
NA,have paid his debts to many people quite,38
NA,unconsciously. This proposal will not,38
NA,"commend itself to the people of Australia,",38
NA,and I should be very greatly surprised,38
NA,"it commends itself to any court, though",38
NA,from the court to be established under,38
NA,"this bill anything may emerge, because",38
NA,will be a creature of the Government's,38
NA,own making. I f the Government is able,38
NA,firmly convinced that i t cannot submit,38
NA,this legislation to the High Court with,38
NA,any chance of success i t should not go t>,38
NA,the trouble of making provision f or the,38
NA,"Federal Court, of Claims. I impress upon",38
NA,honorable members opposite that there,38
NA,are certain powers which this Parliament,38
NA,has tbe sole right to exercise under the,38
NA,Constitution. I f the power of acquisition,38
NA,is to be exercised i t can bo exercised,38
NA,solely by the Commonwealth Parliament,38
NA,in its own right. I f the power of compen-,38
NA,is to be exercised i t can be exercised,38
NA,to only by the Parliament. The Parliament,38
NA,Comcannot delegate those powers to the Com-,38

NA,Mr FRASER.:-The - honorable mem-,39
NA,ber said that the electors of. Eden-Monaro,39
NA,are not prepared to accept this legislation.,39
NA,Let me inform him that on. Saturday last,39
NA,"I. addressed, the latest of a series of public",39
NA,meetings in ray electorate on this issue;,39
NA,"That meeting, which was presided over",39
NA,"by the Mayor of Bega, was held in the",39
NA,main street of that town. I t was held in,39
NA,"the morning, when hundreds of people",39
NA,from the surrounding districts were in,39
NA,town to do their shopping. Only one,39
NA,question could be regarded as hostile. I t,39
NA,was put by a man who said that he would,39
NA,not vote for the nationalization of the,39
NA,banks because he did not get from the,39
NA,Commonwealth Bank the accommodation,39
NA,he was able to get from the private trad-,39
NA,ing banks. I asked him when such,39
NA,"accommodation had been refused, and he",39
NA,"replied, ""That was in 1939 "". I then,",39
NA,explained the set-up of the Common-,39
NA,"wealth Bank in 1939, and the elector and",39
NA,other members of the audience were satis-,39
NA,fied. Similar meetings which I have,39
NA,"addressed at Goulburn and Bombala, in",39
NA,"my electorate, have recorded unanimous",39
NA,votes of confidence in the Government in,39
NA,connexion with this proposal. I have,39
NA,issued invitations to debate to Parliam-,39
NA,tai-ians who have entered my electorate,39
NA,to oppose nationalization of banking.,39
NA,Not one of the invitations I have issued,39
NA,has been accepted. Those invitations still,39
NA,stand.,39
Mr HARRISON ,Wentworth) [5.56].,39
NA,- I look upon clause 37 as one of the,39
NA,most interesting in the bill. I ex-,39
NA,pected the Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley),39
NA,to make a clear statement as to how the,39
NA,purchase of the assets of the trading,39
NA,"banks was to be financed, but I was dis-",39
NA,appointed. The right honorable gentle-,39
NA,man merely said that he had received an,39
NA,assurance from the Commonwealth Bank,39
NA,that the tangible assets of the private,39
NA,banks would be paid for as part of the,39
NA,ordinary 'business transactions of the,39
NA,bank. That statement causes me to look,39
NA,at the balance-sheet of the Common-,39
NA,wealth Bank in order to ascertain,39
NA,whether it has the necessary resources to,39
NA,meet such a huge payment as is contem-,39
NA,plated in this proposal. I have ascer-,39
NA,tained that the Commonwealth Bank has,39
NA,"assets valued at Â£14,000,000.",39
NA,"wonders, therefore, how it will be possible",39
NA,for. the Commonwealth Bank to finance,39
NA,suGh a tremendous transaction as is in-,39
NA,volved in this proposal. I f L were in,39
NA,business and had assets of the value of,39
NA,"approximately Â£1.4,000,000 and was able",39
NA,to devise a scheme whereby I could,39
NA,"acquire the assets of. some other concern,",39
NA,"worth Â£100,000,000, in order to merge it",39
NA,"with my own, I would be nothing short of",39
NA,a financial wizard. I f that is what the,39
NA,"Commonwealth Bank proposes to do,",39
NA,surely it is the craziest kind of finance if,39
NA,is possible to conceive.,39
NA,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,39
Mr HARRISON ,Prio r to the sus-,39
NA,"pension of the sitting, when, pointing out",39
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank lacked the,39
NA,wherewithal necessary to negotiate the,39
NA,purchase of the assets of the trading,39
NA,"banks, I used an incorrect figure. I said",39
NA,that the total excess of assets over lia-,39
NA,bilities of the Commonwealth Bank was,39
NA,"Â£34,000,000; However, I have since read",39
NA,in the report and balance-sheet of tb*,39
NA,Commonwealth Savings Bank as at the,39
NA,"30th June, 1947, that the capital reserve",39
NA,"funds and the special reserves, which of",39
NA,course represent the excess of assets over,39
NA,"liabilities, amount to Â£22,000,000. I f I",39
NA,"could acquire Â£100,000,000 worth of",39
NA,"assets with a backing of only Â£22,000,000,",39
NA,I should consider that I had negotiated,39
NA,"an extraordinarily satisfactory deal, and",39
NA,"indeed, should regard myself as a wizard",39
NA,of finance. The method of purchase pro-,39
NA,"posed by the Prime Minister, therefore,",39
NA,seems to me to be a crazy system of finance,39
NA,having no virtue whatever. When he was,39
NA,gibed at with regard -to the depreciated,39
NA,"currency in Australia, the Prime Minis-",39
NA,"ter said, "" Why talk about depreciated",39
NA,currency? The fact is that people in the,39
NA,United Kingdom can purchase 40 per,39
NA,"cent, less, and in the United States of",39
NA,"America 60 per cent, less, than people in",39
NA,Australia can purchase with an equivalent,39
NA,"amount of money. Therefore, we are in",39
NA,"an extremely good position"". Notwith-",39
NA,standing how the right honorable gentle-,39
NA,man may attempt to gloss over the depre-,39
NA,"ciation of our currency, the Australian",39
NA,Â£1 to-day will purchase only the quantity,39
NA,of goods that could have been purchased,39
NA,for 12s. before the war. The truth is that,39
NA,the Government proposes to take over the,39
NA,One assets of the private banks with an in-,39
NA,flated currency. Wc have seen the dire,39
NA,results of the transfer of assets i n otheii,40
NA,countries inwhich currency haa become,40
NA,excessively inflated.,40
NA,The right honorable gentleman said that,40
NA,lie could not imagine the shareholders,40
NA,accepting bank notes' in payment for their,40
NA,shares. He declared that they would,40
NA,want tohave some form of investment,40
NA,and that they would not regard notes as,40
NA,an investment. Therefore he had no,40
NA,doubt that bonds or cheques would be,40
NA,"issued by the Commonwealth Bank, i f the",40
NA,"shareholders so desired, to liquidate its",40
NA,indebtedness' to them. This statement,40
NA,deserves' investigation. Let us examine,40
NA,it. The people who originally purchased,40
NA,trading bank shares did so in order to,40
NA,secure investments. They did not buy,40
NA,shares merely to acquire an easily realiz-,40
NA,able asset. They wanted to obtain a,40
NA,return from the money so invested'. I n -,40
NA,"deed, such purchases were a safeguard.",40
NA,They provided a guaranteed uniform,40
NA,return over s period of years; which the,40
NA,buyers wanted for reasons best known to,40
NA,themselves. As soon as those shares are,40
NA,"taken over, the possibility of earning",40
NA,money by investment of the proceeds im-,40
NA,mediately disappears. The investor then,40
NA,will have nothing but a cheque account,40
NA,"with the Commonwealth Bank, or bonds,",40
NA,"as the case may be. I n either case, he will",40
NA,lose a certain percentage of that which,40
NA,he originally sought to secure by way of,40
NA,"investment. Therefore, i t seems to me",40
NA,that the Government has an added obliga-,40
NA,tion to pay compensation to the share-,40
NA,holders for the loss of returns which they,40
NA,expected to receive from gilt-edged invest-,40
NA,ments. I f the Commonwealth. Bank,40
NA,"liquidates, its obligations to the share-",40
NA,"holders by means of cheques, those per-",40
NA,sons will be left to choose between two,40
NA,unsatisfactory alternatives. I f they wish,40
NA,to secure a return greater than that pro-,40
NA,vided by the bonds' which the Prime Min-,40
NA,"ister has mentioned, they must withdraw",40
NA,their money from the cheque accounts and,40
NA,"invest it, probably in some industrial",40
NA,undertaking. But where will they be able,40
NA,to invest it ? With the threat of socializaby,40
NA,tion hanging over the heads of the people,40
NA,"of Australia, they are not likely to take",40
NA,chances with such investments lest their,40
NA,money should be lost overnight. I t seems,40
NA,"to me, therefore, that' these cheque",40
NA,accounts will be operated upon ultimately,40
NA,and bank notes will be paid out to meet,40
NA,withdrawals. This will result in the,40
NA,whittling down of the shareholders' capi-,40
NA,tal holdings. The final effect will be,40
NA,equivalent to the acquisition oÂ£ shares by,40
NA,means of the exchange of bank notes.,40
NA,This will mean that the shares will be,40
NA,"taken over with an inflated currency,",40
NA,because most of them were purchased,40
NA,years ago when the Australian Â£ 1 was,40
NA,"worth approximately Â£1. To-day, as I",40
NA,"have pointed out, the purchasing power",40
NA,of the Australian Â£1 is approximately 12s.,40
NA,This sort of thing has been practised by,40
NA,financiers through the ages. I t is equi-,40
NA,valent to taking advantage of inflated,40
NA,currency for the purpose of acquiring,40
NA,some asset on advantageous terms' to the,40
NA,purchaser. Such a transaction by a go-,40
NA,vernment cannot be condoned. I f finance,40
NA,is to remain on a sound footing in Aus-,40
NA,"tralia, the Government must have backing",40
NA,for the cheques which it will pay to the,40
NA,shareholders of the private banks. How-,40
NA,ever; the excess of assets over liabilities,40
NA,in the Commonwealth Bank amounts to,40
NA,"only Â£22,000,000. Yet the Government",40
NA,"seeks to acquire assets worth Â£100,000,000!",40
NA,Now I put my finger on the greatest,40
NA,weakness in the Government's scheme.,40
NA,Already we know that the special accounts,40
NA,of the trading banks lodged with the,40
NA,Commonwealth Bank amount to no less,40
NA,"than Â£268,000,000. That will provide the",40
NA,backing for the cheques which will be,40
NA,issued for the acquisition of the,40
NA,"Â£100,000,000 worth of assets. What are",40
NA,"we to think, of a government that, is pre-",40
NA,"pared to use an amount of. Â£26S,000,000",40
NA,"that has been extracted from, the private",40
NA,banks by force under the legislation of,40
NA,"1945, and deposited with the Common-",40
NA,"wealth Bank, as backing for cheques",40
NA,issued' as payment for the assets of the,40
NA,trading banks? I n his wordy speech on,40
NA,"this matter, all that the Prime Minister",40
NA,said was that the Commonwealth Bank,40
NA,"might issue bonds, or pay the shareholders",40
NA,"cheque. As I have shown, an examina-",40
NA,tion of the assets and liabilities of the,40
NA,"Commonwealth Bank, reveals that ac-",40
NA,"cording to sound banking practice, the",40
NA,bank could not make available sufficient,40
NA,"funds for the purpose of this legislation,",40
NA,"unless it had something more behind, it.",40
NA,"That something, of course, is the",40
NA,"Â£268,000,000 in the special account, and",41
NA,that money belongs to the trading hanks.,41
NA,Clause 40 is rather interesting. I t,41
NA,deals with the payment of compensation.,41
NA,The second and third sub-clauses state-,41
NA,2. The amount nf compensation payable,41
NA,"shall, unless agreed upon, lie determined by",41
NA,the Court and not in any other manner.,41
NA,3. The milking of uu agreement under the,41
NA,last preceding sub-section shall be subject to,41
NA,the approval of the Treasurer.,41
NA,Although the Prime Minister has said,41
NA,that the Commonwealth Bank gives an,41
NA,"assurance that it can negotiate this deal,",41
NA,the arrangement will be subject to the,41
NA,"approval of the Treasurer. Obviously,",41
NA,the bank could not negotiate even one,41
NA,word of an agreement off its own bat.,41
NA,I t must await political direction. The,41
NA,Treasurer must approve any arrange-,41
NA,"ment, agreement, or contract entered into",41
NA,by the Commonwealth and the share-,41
NA,holders.,41
The CHAIRMAN , Mr Clark) -,41
NA,Order! The honorable member's time,41
NA,has expired.,41
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne-Ministe r,41
NA,for Information and Minister for Immi-,41
NA,gration) [8.12] -Th e clauses encom-,41
NA,passed in this part of the bill cover some,41
NA,of its most important features. Clause,41
NA,46 prohibits the carrying on of banking,41
NA,business by private hanks. Other clauses,41
NA,deal with compensation for the acquisi-,41
NA,tion of shares and the method by which,41
NA,"settlements are to be reached. However,",41
NA,tbe really important clause in this group,41
NA,is that which provides that private banks,41
NA,shall never again be permitted to carry,41
NA,on business in Australia. One would,41
NA,imagine from all the noise that has been,41
NA,made about the taking over of the banks,41
NA,fhat something revolutionary was being,41
NA,attempted. I t has been said that this is,41
NA,the first step in a ten-year plan of sociali-,41
NA,zation. Nothing could be more false.,41
NA,"This legislation, and in particular the",41
NA,"clause to which I have directed attention,",41
NA,proposes to nationalize banking. I t is,41
NA,not a means to an end. I t is an end in,41
NA,"itself, and has no reference to any pro-",41
NA,posal to socialize or nationalize other,41
NA,undertakings. As I pointed out in my,41
NA,"second-reading speech, we have not the",41
NA,constitutional power even to socialize a,41
NA,lolly shop. But we are concerned about,41
NA,the continuation of private banking in,41
NA,"this country, because we believe that the",41
NA,public credit of the nation should be,41
NA,handled by the elected representatives of,41
NA,the nation and not by 50 or 60 bank,41
NA,directors who control the destinies of nine,41
NA,trading banks. I f this legislation were,41
NA,"never passed, there would still be fewer",41
NA,banks for the people to deal with twelve,41
NA,months hence than there are now. There,41
NA,is a 'merger on the way to completion,41
NA,between the National Bank of Australasia,41
NA,Limited and the Queensland National,41
NA,"Bank Limited, and there was a proposal",41
NA,"for a merger between two English banks,",41
NA,"the Union Bank of Australia Limited,",41
NA,and the Bank of Australasia. Negotia-,41
NA,tions for this second merger had pro-,41
NA,gressed to a certain point when it was,41
NA,decided by the directors of the banks con-,41
NA,cerned that nothing further should be,41
NA,"done in the direction of,completing the",41
NA,amalgamation until the effect of this,41
NA,legislation had been determined in the,41
NA,"Parliament, and possibly, ultimately,",41
NA,"in the courts. So, when honorable mem-",41
NA,bers opposite talk about a number of,41
NA,banks being available for the people to,41
NA,"deal with, I point out that that number",41
NA,is continually 'diminishing. I n 1917,41
NA,"it was 23, in 1947 it is nine, and should",41
NA,this legislation find disfavour in the High,41
NA,Court on the ground that it is ultra,41
NA,"vires the Constitution, there would only",41
NA,be seven banks by the end of next year,41
NA,"and, no doubt, fewer later on. Ultimately,",41
NA,we should reach the point when there were,41
NA,"perhaps two or three, or even one. Thus,",41
NA,the much-vaunted right of the people to,41
NA,transfer their accounts from one bank to,41
NA,another is proved to be a nullity. Even,41
NA,to-day there is a complete understanding,41
NA,between the private trading banks.,41
Mr MENZIES ,T o what clause is the,41
NA,Minister referring!,41
Mr CALWELL ,I ! am dealing with,41
NA,the prohibition of private banking. That,41
NA,"is an important clause, as the right honor-",41
NA,able gentleman will perceive. Mr L. J.,41
NA,"MCConnan, the chief manager of the",41
NA,"National Bank of Australasia Limited,",41
NA,"in a radio talk not long ago, sought to",41
NA,"prove that, after all, the people, and not,",41
NA,"the shareholders, owned the banks. These",41
NA,were his words-,41
NA,The banks are just concerns established by,41
NA,the people to look after their personal finan-,41
NA,cial affairs and to carry out their wishes. The,41
NA,bald facts of the Australian banking system,41
NA,are perfectly plain. The hanks have been,42
NA,"created by the people, they are owned by the",42
NA,"people, and they are controlled by the people.",42
NA,And that's the democratic way.,42
NA,This is Mr MCGonnan speaking-,42
NA,Why should any government interfere with,42
NA,this democratic arrangement?,42
NA,If all the shareholders in the private,42
NA,"banks resided in this country, Mr.",42
NA,MCConnan might be able to say at least,42
NA,"that these banks were owned by 70,000",42
NA,"Australians, that they functioned in the",42
NA,"interest of 70,000 Australians, and that",42
NA,"the profits went to 70,000 Australian",42
NA,shareholders. But the truth of the matter,42
NA,"is that, although there are 70,000 share-""",42
NA,"holders, only 35,000 of them live in Aus-",42
NA,tralia. I have before me a very infor-,42
NA,"mative table, which shows the profits",42
NA,made by the trading banks between,42
NA,IS93 and 1946. I n those years the aggre-,42
NA,gate profits of tlie trading banks-,42
NA,maybe not the net profits-amounte d,42
NA,"to Â£12S,000,000. That Â£128,000,000",42
NA,"profit, made out of banking, went",42
NA,"to 70,000 shareholders. I f the divi-",42
NA,sion of the profit was in the,42
NA,same ratio as the division of shareholders,42
NA,"inside Australia and outside Australia,",42
NA,"Â£60,000,000 of profit made out of banking",42
NA,went to people who have never seen Aus-,42
NA,tralia or even lived here at all.,42
Mr SPENDER ,I s that gross or net,42
NA,profit?,42
Mr CALWELL , I iuu speaking of,42
NA,aggregate profit. The net profit may be,42
NA,"perhaps Â£8,000,000 or Â£10,000.000 lass.",42
NA,"At any rate, approximately Â£50,000,000",42
NA,of profit went to people whose interest,42
NA,in this country between 1893 and 1946-,42
NA,the shareholders have never numbered,42
NA,"more than 70,000 at any time-di d not",42
NA,"even know where Sydney, Melbourne, or",42
NA,Brisbane were. All they knew was that,42
NA,Australia was a continent out of which,42
NA,they were making profit. To-day we are,42
NA,doing our best to let them know where the,42
NA,"National Capital is, because any profit",42
NA,that is to be made out of banking in this,42
NA,country should go to Australian citizens,42
NA,-th e people whose labour makes Aus-,42
NA,"tralia prosperous, and whose services, like",42
NA,"those of their parents and grandparents,",42
NA,have made this country what it is. i f,42
NA,"for no other reason than that, half of",42
NA,the shareholders in the private banks,42
NA,have never seen Australia and are not in-,42
NA,terested in this land except for profit,42
NA,"making, we should nationalize the banks.",42
NA,"The private banks, i f they were wise in",42
NA,"their own generation, would have seen",42
NA,that their shares were transferred to an,42
NA,Australian register; but they were selfish,42
NA,"and greedy, and wanted to make what",42
NA,profit they could and take it out of the,42
NA,country. But the banks which are sup-,42
NA,"posed to help the people in time of need,",42
NA,and are supposed to be most helpful in,42
NA,"time of depression, present, this unique",42
NA,"picture to Australians that, whereas in",42
NA,the depression years most industries paid,42
NA,"no profit at all, while all industries, more",42
NA,"or less were endangered, and some indus-",42
NA,tries had to call on reserves to keep,42
NA,"going, no bank in Australia during that",42
NA,period was conducted at other than a,42
NA,profit. Every single bank in Australia,42
NA,made a profit during each year,42
NA,of the depression. They made very,42
NA,"big profits before the depression,",42
NA,and they made reasonable profits,42
NA,"during the depression, i f we have",42
NA,some regard to the condition of other,42
NA,"people. The English, Scottish and Aus-",42
NA,"tralian Bank, which refused from 1893 to",42
NA,1946 to pay those who held interminable,42
NA,"stock sums amounting to Â£2^000,000,",42
NA,"paid dividends as high as 20 per cent, in",42
NA,"some years, whilst the average divi-",42
NA,dend of the banks was approxi-,42
NA,"mately 14 per cent, per annum",42
NA,when the depression commenced. To-,42
NA,"day, the banks are not making such",42
NA,great profits; but it was not this Govern-,42
NA,ment which curtailed their profits. I t,42
NA,was our predecessors in the war years,42
NA,who told the banks that they were not,42
NA,to be allowed to invest surplus funds in,42
NA,"war loans, or make advances to other",42
NA,"people to invest in war loans, so that the",42
NA,banks could make a profit on a profit as,42
NA,they did during World War I . I t was,42
NA,a government of which the honorable,42
NA,member for Warringah ( Mr Spender),42
NA,was a member which restrained the banks,42
NA,in that way in the national interest.,42
NA,When the honorable member had respon-,42
NA,sibility of government he was prepared,42
NA,to do something to protect the national,42
NA,"interest, but now he is out of government",42
NA,he is thoroughly irresponsible. A l l he,42
NA,has done in this debate is to barrack for,42
NA,tlie banks. He does not care what profits,42
NA,they make. I t does not matter what the.,42
NA,future might hold; we say that the banks,42
NA,must be nationalized. The Opposition,43
NA,says that they should not :be nationalized.,43
Mr TURNBULL ,Wha t do the people,43
NA,say?,43
Mr CALWELL ,Th e people say that,43
NA,the Government's 1945 banking legisla-,43
NA,tion should be supported; and that they,43
NA,returned this Government after the,43
NA,passage of that legislation. But neither,43
NA,the party to which the honorable member,43
NA,"for Wimmera ( Mr Turnbull) belongs,",43
NA,nor that to Avhich the honorable member,43
NA,"for Warringah belongs, has stated where",43
NA,it stands with respect to the 1945 legisla-,43
NA,tion.,43
Mr SPENDER ,"Yes , I did.",43
Mr CALWELL ,Doe s the honorable,43
NA,gentleman speak for the Liberal party?,43
Mr SPENDER , I express the same,43
NA,views as the Liberal party expresses.,43
Mr CALWELL , The honorable,43
NA,gentleman and his party-an d I em-,43
NA,phasize the party aspect-hav e not de-,43
NA,clared their attitude with respect to the,43
NA,1945 banking legislation. So unsatisfac-,43
NA,tory is their negative approach to,43
NA,this question that the Sydney Sunday,43
NA,Sun last Sunday published a leader,43
NA,headed- I hope that the Leader of,43
NA,the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) does not,43
NA,mind when I read the language-,43
NA,""" Menzies must remove this doubt"",",43
NA,which stated that the Liberal party must,43
NA,say where it stands with respect to the,43
NA,1945 banking legislation.,43
Mr MENZIES , I read that article,43
NA,"to-day, and it contains a grossly untrue",43
NA,statement.,43
Mr CALWELL ,The right honorable,43
NA,gentleman can have that out with the,43
NA,editor of the Sunday Sun.,43
Mr MENZIES ,Th e article contains a,43
NA,statement that I said that i f we won we,43
NA,would repeal the banking legislation.,43
NA,No such statement was contained in my,43
NA,policy speech.,43
Mr CALWELL ,Th e right honor-,43
NA,able gentleman must make himself right,43
NA,with his own supporters on that point;,43
NA,"but, at any rate, even i f what he says be",43
NA,correct he ha9 still to declare his attitude,43
NA,towards the 1945 legislation. He did not,43
NA,do it before the 1946 elections.,43
Mr MENZIES ," I did it in this House,",43
NA,in plain terms.,43
Mr CALWELL ,Di d the right,43
NA,honorable gentleman support the 1945,43
NA,legislation ?,43
Mr MENZIES ,I n a few minutes 1,43
NA,shall read what I did say.,43
Mr CALWELL ,Whe n we come to,43
NA,the Leader of the Australian Country,43
NA,party ( Mr Fadden) it is still more diffi-,43
NA,"cult to state his position, because in his",43
NA,second-reading speech on this measure,43
NA,he attacked one of the vital principles,43
NA,"of the 1945 legislation, namely, that deal-",43
NA,ing with the special accounts which the,43
NA,private banks have to lodge with the,43
NA,Commonwealth Bank. He derided the,43
NA,argument of the Government that that,43
NA,fund was established as a safeguard,43
NA,against secondary inflation. I t waa,43
NA,"established by his own Government, but",43
NA,"he derides it now. I n effect, he says",43
NA,""" Let us disregard secondary inflation,",43
NA,"and give the banks back their money,",43
NA,"and let them invest it, not at 1 per cent.,",43
NA,"but at any per cent, they can get"".",43
Mr FADDEN , I did not say anything,43
NA,of the sort.,43
Mr CALWELL ,Th e right honorable,43
NA,gentleman implied that. He can make,43
NA,clear to the country where he stands on,43
NA,this matter.,43
NA,The honorable member for Warringah,43
NA,has suggested that there may be shares,43
NA,in an Australian private bank which are,43
NA,not compulsorily acquired on the date,43
NA,specified in a notice given under clause,43
NA,"13, that these shares may belong to Eng-",43
NA,lish shareholders and that the value of,43
NA,"these shares may fall before they are,",43
NA,"in due course, vested in the Common-",43
NA,wealth Bank. The honorable member,43
NA,can rest assured that i f these shares are,43
NA,subsequently acquired the position of any,43
NA,such shareholders shall not in any way be,43
NA,prejudiced by the fact that their shares,43
NA,were acquired by the Commonwealth,43
NA,Bank at a later date than in the case,43
NA,of Australian shareholders.,43
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The,43
NA,Minister has exhausted his time.,43
Mr SPENDER ,Warringah) [8.27] -,43
NA,The Minister for Information ( Mr.,43
NA,Calwell) has given us a second-reading,43
NA,"speech on clause 46, and for the second",43
NA,time we have heard him going back to,43
NA,the depression. He and his colleagues,43
NA,can never extricate themselves from the,43
NA,bog of the depression. He rested all his,44
NA,arguments upon conditions which may,44
NA,"have obtained 20 or 30 years ago, but",44
NA,which have no bearing on the,44
NA,problem confronting ns to-day. He,44
NA,drew attention to the fact that the,44
NA,interest which was charged by pri-,44
NA,vate banks over a period of 50 years,44
NA,"had resulted in substantial profits,",44
NA,but he conceded that they do not make,44
NA,"those profits now, nor have they made",44
NA,them for some years past. I t is well,44
NA,"that this point should be clarified,",44
NA,because that has never been a real issue,44
NA,in this debate. We admit that there,44
NA,"should be control over interest rates,",44
NA,control over the general policy of,44
NA,"advances, control over currency, control",44
NA,"over credit and central bank operations,",44
NA,"and, consequently, control over the ulti-",44
NA,"mate profits of the private banks. Indeed,",44
NA,that was the policy pursued by the Go-,44
NA,vernment of which I was a member,44
NA,"during the war, as was conceded by the",44
NA,Minister. So it is to-day. Those,44
NA,"controls, which, without any doubt",44
NA,"whatever, are matters with respect to",44
NA,banking which could not be successfully,44
NA,"challenged-an d if they were, this bill",44
NA,falls to the ground-remov e all the,44
NA,abuses the Minister complained about.,44
NA,"Therefore, the only reason for this legis-",44
NA,lation is for the purpose of vesting com-,44
NA,plete control of all financial transactions,44
NA,in the Government.,44
NA,There is inherent in the Minister's,44
NA,speech something to which I draw first,44
NA,the attention of the Prime Minister,44
NA,"( Mr Chifley), because our experience",44
NA,"in this chamber is that, whilst his MinisCourt",44
NA,"ters say one thing he, himself, says",44
NA,another. The Minister for Information,44
NA,"says, "" Why not remove the shareholders",44
NA,"of the banks? There are 75,000 of them,",44
NA,and half of them do not reside in this,44
NA,country. That is a good reason why the,44
NA,Government should take over the private,44
NA,"banks"". I find that difficult to undervision",44
NA,"stand, particularly in view of the Prime",44
NA,Minister's statement this afternoon about,44
NA,how people are going to invest their,44
NA,money in this country. I f,44
NA,Government believes that the Commonpensation;,44
NA,wealth should take over a business beany,44
NA,"cause foreign capital is invested in it,",44
NA,"the Prime Minister say so, and not leave",44
NA,it to the Minister for Information to,44
NA,[711,44
NA,make the disclosure. That is what was,44
NA,"said, and that was clearly what the Min-",44
NA,"ister had in mind. His words were,",44
NA,""" That was a good reason why the private",44
NA,banks should be taken over by the Govern-,44
NA,"ment, because one half of the shares were",44
NA,"owned by English capital"". Honorable",44
NA,members opposite should do their utmost,44
NA,to encourage the investment of more,44
NA,"British capital in Australia, instead of",44
NA,endeavouring to destroy confidence in the,44
NA,future of this country by statements such,44
NA,as those which the Minister made. I t is,44
NA,futile for the Prime Minister to speak,44
NA,of attracting British capital to Australia,44
NA,when he permits the Minister to make,44
NA,statements of that kind.,44
NA,I have directed attention to the need,44
NA,to give some firm basis of consideration,44
NA,to the position of the English share-,44
NA,"holders in private banks in Australia, and",44
NA,I have not yet received a reply. Under,44
NA,"this part of the bill, two classes of share-",44
NA,holder are dealt with. One is the Aus-,44
NA,"tralian shareholder in the banks, which",44
NA,are set out in Part I . of the first schedule.,44
NA,These are the shareholders whose shares,44
NA,will be taken over under clause 13. Then,44
NA,there are other shareholders to whom,44
NA,"clause 22 applies, under which the Com-",44
NA,monwealth will take over the assets as,44
NA,distinct from the shares of the private,44
NA,banks. Regarding both of those,44
NA,"classes of shareholders, Part IV .",44
NA,provides that in the event of an,44
NA,agreement not being reached between the,44
NA,Government and the shareholders in the,44
NA,"instance, or the Government and the",44
NA,"private banks in the second instance, the",44
NA,issue may be determined by the Federal,44
NA,of Claims. The problem to which,44
NA,I directed attention is a problem which,44
NA,affects British and foreign shareholders.,44
NA,I t is all very well for the Government,44
NA,to say that we can rest assured that those,44
NA,"persons will get a fair go. I prefer, i f I",44
NA,"may say so, to see an appropriate pro-",44
NA,contained in the bill. This is what,44
NA,"can happen. Under clause 13, those who",44
NA,hold shares on the Australian register,44
NA,may receive notice of the taking over of,44
NA,"the the shares, leaving them rights of com-",44
NA,but the bill does not contain,44
NA,provision with respect to taking over,44
NA,let the shares of English shareholders. The,44
NA,"position, then, is that the Government",44
NA,"will take over the Australian shares, and",44
NA,"appoint its own directors who, under the",45
NA,"bill, will have complete power to carry",45
NA,on in any way they think fit for the pur-,45
NA,pose of selling the assets to the Common-,45
NA,"wealth Bank, and finally winding up the",45
NA,"affairs of the private banks. Then, the",45
NA,time will come when the directors of the,45
NA,"Australian banks, who are the mere",45
NA,nominees of the Government or the Com-,45
NA,"monwealth Bank, will decide the terms",45
NA,"upon which liquidation shall take place,",45
NA,and tbe assets be handed over. The in-,45
NA,terests of the English shareholders will,45
NA,depend upon the nature of the bargain,45
NA,that the liquidators or directors of the,45
NA,company ultimately make with the Com-,45
NA,monwealth Bank. The .bill should make,45
NA,provision for the English shareholders.,45
NA,The position can easily be met by hav-,45
NA,ing an appropriate amendment inserted,45
NA,in the bill when the Senate is considering,45
NA,it. I t could be dealt with by a provision,45
NA,"that any English shareholder, who felt",45
NA,aggrieved with the amount paid to him,45
NA,for his shares or for his interest in the,45
NA,"private hank, should have the right to",45
NA,bring the matter before the Federal Court,45
NA,of Claims. That is a reasonable pro-,45
NA,"position. Otherwise, he would be left",45
NA,"entirely in the hands of the Government,",45
NA,without redress. The directors might be,45
NA,following the policy which they think fit,45
NA,and which they believe to be in the in-,45
NA,"terests of the Commonwealth Bank, but",45
NA,their decisions can vitally and adversely,45
NA,affect the interest of the British share-,45
NA,holders. I ask the Prime Minister to,45
NA,give me an assurance that some provision,45
NA,will be made to enable the English share-,45
NA,"holder, if he feels aggrieved in the cir-",45
NA,"cumstances which I have described, to",45
NA,have recourse to the Federal Court of,45
NA,Claims.,45
NA,"Earlier, the Prime Minister replied to",45
NA,a question as to how this transaction will,45
NA,be financed. It is agreed that approxi-,45
NA,"mately Â£100,000,000 is involved. As the",45
NA,"honorable member for ""Wentworth ( Mr.",45
NA,"Harrison) pointed out, the available",45
NA,disclosed assets in the Common-,45
NA,wealth Bank are not sufficient for,45
NA,the purpose of financing a trans-,45
NA,action of this magnitude. The Prime,45
NA,"Minister said, "" Well, it can be dealt",45
NA,"as an ordinary trading advance. Here,",45
NA,the assets are being transferred to the,45
NA,"Commonwealth Bank. It, can advance",45
NA,Mr Spender.,45
NA,the money for the purpose of acquiring,45
NA,"these assets"". I f that argument be",45
NA,correct-it s shallowness will be revealed,45
NA,shortly-w e can say that all Common-,45
NA,wealth public works can also be financed,45
NA,"by the Commonwealth Bank, because",45
NA,"assets are created, the Commonwealth",45
NA,"Bank can provide the requisite capital,",45
NA,and additional taxe9 need not be imposed,45
NA,for the purpose of meeting it. I f that,45
NA,"argument be correct, the Government",45
NA,could nationalize any business in Aus-,45
NA,tralia by merely increasing the liabilities,45
NA,of the Commonwealth' in terms of bonds,45
NA,or currency which is available in the com-,45
NA,munity.,45
NA,I t requires no exemplification to prove,45
NA,that if we increase the liabilities of the,45
NA,"country, whether in the terms of increased",45
NA,"currency circulating in the community,",45
NA,"or of securities, we must vitally affect the",45
NA,"national economy. To that matter, little",45
NA,consideration has been given. I t was,45
NA,"only when the Prime Minister was forced,",45
NA,by constant requests as to how the trans-,45
NA,"action would be financed, to refer to the",45
NA,"subject, that we received this extra-",45
NA,ordinary reply. All I have to say is that,45
NA,if that is the way in which the Govern-,45
NA,ment proposes to finance the affairs of,45
NA,the country^ it will not be long before the,45
NA,people realize that the Prime Minister's,45
NA,reputation for financial wizardry is,45
NA,purely a myth. I t is fantastic to pretend,45
NA,"that any transaction, no matter what",45
NA,"amount is involved, whether it be",45
NA,"Â£100,000,000 to cover the taking over of",45
NA,"the private banks or Â£1,000,000,000 for",45
NA,the purpose of nationalizing many indus-,45
NA,"tries, can be financed simply by the Com-",45
NA,monwealth Bank increasing the liabilities,45
NA,"of the country, without serious conse-",45
NA,quences to the community.,45
NA,"For the reasons which I have stated,",45
NA,the Prime Minister should reply to the,45
NA,statements of the Minister for Informa-,45
NA,"tion. Does the Prime Minister stand, or",45
NA,"does he not stand, by the Minister's state-",45
NA,"ment that, because nearly one half of the",45
NA,shares in the private banks are held for,45
NA,the most part by shareholders in Great,45
NA,"Britain, that is a good reason why",45
NA,the Commonwealth should take over,45
NA,with the banks? Let the Prime Minister say,45
NA,whether the Minister has expressed his,45
NA,views. I f he does not agree with that,45
NA,"statement, let him make his position clear,",45
NA,because this is exceedingly important.,46
NA,"Secondly, I ask the right honorable",46
NA,gentleman to give an undertaking in,46
NA,respect of English shareholders. They,46
NA,should not be obliged to rely upon what-,46
NA,ever government is in office at the time.,46
NA,The life of the present Government will,46
NA,shortly come to a close. Honorable mem-,46
NA,"bers opposite may laugh, but they know",46
NA,that my statement is true. For this,46
NA,"Government, the writing is already on the",46
NA,wall. I t will not be long before it will,46
NA,"be out of office, as it deserves. Finally,",46
NA,1 should like to know what the Prime,46
NA,Minister proposes to do about compensa-,46
NA,tion for the private banks incorporated,46
NA,elsewhere. These are referred to in Part,46
NA,[ II . of the first schedule. So far as,46
NA,"able to see, the effect of this part of the",46
NA,"bill will be that none of the banks, includ-",46
NA,ing those in Part III . of the first,46
NA,"schedule, namely, the Bank of China, the",46
NA,Bank of New Zealand and the Comptoir,46
NA,"National d'Escompte de Paris, will be",46
NA,"permitted to function in Australia, and",46
NA,the bill does not contain any provision for,46
NA,compensating them i f clause 46 of the bill,46
NA,is relied upon-a s it could be exclusively,46
NA,-t o destroy the private banks. Perhaps,46
NA,the right honorable gentleman will be,46
NA,able to show that my interpretation of,46
NA,these provisions is wrong; but I have yet,46
NA,to discover in the bill that these institu-,46
NA,tions will be compensated for the business,46
NA,that they would lose in these circum-,46
NA,stances.,46
Mr FALSTEIN ,Watson) [8.40] -,46
NA,The honorable member for Warringah,46
NA,"( Mr Spender) referred to the arrangedepartment,",46
NA,ments which the Prime Minister (Mv.,46
NA,Chifley) said have been made for financsimilar sum.,46
NA,ing the acquisition of the shares,46
NA,assets of the private banks as being in the,46
NA,nature of a hoax. Nothing could be,46
NA,ther from the truth. I f the honorable,46
NA,member were to spend more time in the,46
NA,Parliament he could have found out,46
NA,arrangements had been made in regard to,46
NA,"this matter. I n the first place, clauses",46
NA,to 46 provide for two separate parts. The,46
NA,"first part, namely Part VI . , contains",46
NA,"divisions, the first of which provides",46
NA,"the acquisition of the shares of the banks,",46
NA,whilst the second division provides for,46
NA,acquisition of assets. Part VII . is a part,46
NA,to which I thought the Opposition would,46
NA,have offered strong objection because,46
NA,deals with the prohibition of private,46
NA,banking in this country. Before dealing,46
NA,"with Part VII . , however, I should like",46
NA,to refer to some of the arguments which,46
NA,have been advanced by Opposition,46
NA,speakers in relation to Part VI . I t has,46
NA,been said that no clear indication has,46
NA,"been given to the Parliament, or the",46
NA,"country, as to how the assets of the private",46
NA,banks are to be acquired by the Common-,46
NA,wealth Bank - The honorable member,46
NA,for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) and,46
NA,"other "" notable financial authorities""",46
NA,have given a variety of figures purport-,46
NA,ing to be the actual capital of the Com-,46
NA,monwealth Bank. Before the suspension,46
NA,of the sitting for dinner the honorable,46
NA,I am -raemher for Wentworth said that the,46
NA,"assets amounted to Â£14,000,000. I do not",46
NA,know whether he then said that he only,46
NA,""" thought "" that was their value, but later",46
NA,he said that he thought the assets were,46
NA,"valued at Â£22,000,000. He referred to",46
NA,the annual report of the Commonwealth,46
NA,Bank. Any one who wants to obtain in-,46
NA,formation about the capital of the Com-,46
NA,monwealth Bank has only to read thd,46
NA,Commonwealth Bank Act of 1945. The,46
NA,figures' that I shall give to the committee,46
NA,do not include the Commonwealth,46
NA,"Savings Bank, but only the central bank",46
NA,functions and general trading activities,46
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank. The 1945,46
NA,act provides that the central banking,46
NA,department of the Commonwealth Bank,46
NA,"shall have a capital of Â£4,000,000; its",46
NA,general banking division a capital of,46
NA,"Â£4,000,000; the rural credits division a",46
NA,"capital of Â£2,000,000; the mortgage bank",46
NA,"a capital of Â£4,000,000, and",46
NA,the industrial finance department a,46
NA,That makes a total,46
NA,"and authorized capital of Â£18,000,000.",46
Mr HARRISON ,Th e capital of the,46
NA,"furCommonwealth Bank, as set out in its",46
NA,"last report, is Â£16,392,000.",46
Mr FALSTEIN , I shall not accept,46
NA,what the honorable member's figures,46
Mr HARRISON , I have taken them,46
NA,37 from the bank's balance-sheet.,46
Mr FALSTEIN ,Th e argument,46
NA,two would seem to turn on the actual capital,46
NA,for of the Commonwealth Bank or what is,46
NA,provided by way of capital. I merely,46
NA,the draw the attention of the committee to,46
NA,what is provided for in the 1945 act. The,46
NA,"bank may use up to Â£18,000,000 in those",46
NA,it various divisions that I have mentioned.,46
NA,Tlie basis of tbe argument of tbe Opposi-,47
NA,tion is false; its members refer merely,47
NA,"to the capital of the Commonwealth Bank,",47
NA,"without reference to its assets, whereas",47
NA,they refer to the assets of the private,47
NA,banks without mentioning liabilities to,47
NA,shareholders. Opposition members who,47
NA,want the actual figures can have them.,47
NA,The act provides for the utilization of,47
NA,"capital up to Â£18,000,000 distributed in",47
NA,the way that I have already mentioned.,47
NA,Excluding the Commonwealth Savings,47
NA,"Bank, the assets of the Commonwealth",47
NA,"Bank as at the 30th June, 1947, were",47
NA,"valued at Â£730,883,858. That figure must",47
NA,be considered in relation to the amount of,47
NA,capital which the bank is authorized to,47
NA,use should it so desire. For the purposes,47
NA,of comparison I shall read from a state-,47
NA,ment relating to the Australian banking,47
NA,statistics which has been circulated among,47
NA,honorable .members. I t is true that the,47
NA,"figures are not given as at one date, but",47
NA,"it appears to me, from a cursory examina-",47
NA,"tion of them, that they all fall within",47
NA,the one quarter. The returns have not,47
NA,been made as at the 30th June in each,47
NA,"instance, as some of them cover periods",47
NA,"ended the 31st August, the 30th September",47
NA,"or the 14th October. However, as they",47
NA,"all fall in the one quarter, it is fair to",47
NA,cite them. They show that the total,47
NA,liabilities of the private banks to their,47
NA,"shareholders amount to Â£71,426,770. The",47
NA,"assets of the private banks, also covering",47
NA,"diverse periods, but coming within the",47
NA,"same quarter, are shown to be",47
NA,"Â£839,432,222. That is merely illustrative",47
NA,"of the fact that whereas, on the one hand,",47
NA,the trading banks have liabilities to their,47
NA,shareholders amounting to,47
NA,"Â£71,000,000, their assets amount to more",47
NA,"than Â£839,000,000. The Commonwealth",47
NA,Bank has an authorized capital of about,47
NA,"Â£18,000,000 in its central bank and trad-",47
NA,"ing section-tha t is, exclusive of the",47
NA,Commonwealth Savings Bank-bu t its,47
NA,"assets exceed Â£700,000,000; so that what-",47
NA,ever arguments are advanced by the Oppo-,47
NA,"sition, no accountant would deny that a",47
NA,considerable sum of money is available,47
NA,"to the Commonwealth Bank, either im-",47
NA,mediately or over a period of months.,47
NA,There is a positive limitation to what,47
NA,can be done.,47
Mr FADDEN ,What about the excess,47
NA,of assets over liabilities?,47
NA,Mr Falstein.,47
Mr FALSTEIN , I shall present my,47
NA,"argument in my own way, as by that",47
NA,means I shall be more clearly understood.,47
NA,The figures will show what can be done,47
NA,and what is being done. On this subject,47
NA,the Prime Minister in his second-reading,47
NA,speech said-,47
NA,In acquiring the business of the private,47
NA,banks the Commonwealth Bank will also,47
NA,assume the liabilities of these institutions.,47
NA,The amount of compensation payable will,47
NA,"necessarily have regard to this factor, and",47
NA,it will be well within the capacity of the,47
NA,Commonwealth Bank to meet the payments,47
NA,from its own resources. ' The Commonwealth,47
NA,Bank will make payment in cash or govern-,47
NA,ment bonds as desired.,47
NA,Nothing could be more explicit. I refer,47
NA,"to Part VII . of the bill, which includes",47
NA,clause 46. This is the clause which pro-,47
NA,hibits the carrying on of banking business,47
NA,by the private banks. Not one argument,47
NA,has been advanced by honorable members,47
NA,opposite in opposition to clause 46. I t is,47
NA,more than passing strange that this,47
NA,"matter, which ordinarily would have",47
NA,"aroused their hostility, should be passed",47
NA,"over, while the whole of their attention",47
NA,"has been diverted to Part VI . of the bill,",47
NA,which deals with the acquisition of assets,47
NA,and shares. I t would appear that mem-,47
NA,bers of the Opposition do not want to give,47
NA,any indication of possible moves which,47
NA,might be taken outside the Parliament,47
NA,by way of objection to this legislation.,47
NA,"Evidently, they are prepared to let their",47
NA,case rest upon the objections which they,47
NA,have so far taken. When they are blown,47
NA,"out on those, as they undoubtedly will be,",47
NA,they will use the second string to their,47
NA,"over bow. I hope that before the "" guillotine """,47
NA,falls at 11 o'clock to-night we shall hear,47
NA,something from the Leader of the Oppo-,47
NA,sition about clause 46. Honorable mem-,47
NA,bers opposite have been most vocal i n,47
NA,seeking information from the Prime Min-,47
NA,ister. I f we are to carry on this system,47
NA,"of interrogatories, I should like to ask the",47
NA,Leader of the Opposition what he thinks,47
NA,about clause 46.,47
NA,I believe that the provisions in the,47
NA,clauses under consideration are most,47
NA,"reasonable, and I have no hesitation in",47
NA,"recommending them to the committee,",47
NA,despite the fact that the honorable mem-,47
NA,ber for Warringah raised some objection,47
NA,about English shareholders. I am sure,47
NA,that their rights can be adequately pro-,48
NA,tected. Those who know the Prime Min-,48
NA,ister for his honesty and fairness will be,48
NA,quite prepared to let the matter rest in,48
NA,his hands.,48
Mr MENZIES ,Kooyong-Leade r of,48
NA,"the Opposition) [8.52] - I rise, I",48
NA,"hasten to say at once, not to answer",48
NA,"the honorable member for ""Watson ( Mr.",48
NA,"Falstein), because in my experience of",48
NA,him nothing he has ever said has called,48
NA,"for an answer, but to revert to a",48
NA,matter mentioned earlier by the Minister,48
NA,"for Information ( Mr Oalwell), i n",48
NA,regard to Part VII . of the bill.,48
NA,quoted a leading article from the Sunday,48
NA,"Sun, a newspaper not remarkable for its",48
NA,"hostility to the Government, I may say.",48
NA,I n the course of its leading article for,48
NA,"Sunday last, this paper makes this very",48
NA,remarkable statement-,48
NA,"On the 23rd October, during debate on the",48
NA,"bill to nationalize banks, Opposition leader",48
NA,Menzies said that those sections of tlie 1945,48
NA,Act which established this control,48
NA,That is the control which was designed to,48
NA,"prevent secondary inflation-namely , the",48
NA,special accounts provision. The article,48
NA,continues-,48
NA,"had never been challenged, nor was i t sug-",48
NA,gested that they would be. So that even,48
NA,"without a nationalization bill, the Federal",48
NA,Government still had control of banking. But,48
NA,in his policy speech preceding the last federal,48
NA,"election, Menzies said he would repeal the",48
NA,"1945 Act, i f the Opposition won the election.",48
NA,"In the first place, that statement is com-",48
NA,"pletely wrong, and i t is, of course, utterly",48
NA,confused. Two acts relating to banking,48
NA,"were passed in 1945, a fact which ought",48
NA,to be made clear to the public. The first,48
NA,was an act relating to the Commonwealth,48
NA,"Bank, providing for the abolition",48
NA,"of the Commonwealth Bank Board,",48
NA,and the substitution for it of,48
NA,"direct control by a Governor, under",48
NA,"the Treasurer, on all matters of",48
NA,which was the abolition of the Common-,48
NA,"wealth Bank Board, and the substituting",48
NA,"for i t of direct control by a Governor,",48
NA,"under the Treasurer ,on all matters of",48
NA,policy. The second piece of legislation,48
NA,was the Banking Act-no t the Common-,48
NA,wealth Bank Act-bu t the Banking Act,48
NA,"of 1945, and it contained various pro-",48
NA,visions regarding special,48
NA,accounts. As the matter had been speci-,48
NA,"fically dealt with in the Parliament, and",48
NA,I have made the clearest possible state-,48
NA,"ments regarding it, no reference to i t at",48
NA,all appeared in my policy speech. There-,48
NA,"fore, it is untrue to say that in my policy",48
NA,speech I promised to repeal the Banking,48
NA,Act of 1945. No statement was made,48
NA,"by me, or by any member of the Opposi-",48
NA,"tion, about repealing the Banking Act",48
NA,of 1945. At no time did we indicate,48
NA,"that we would, i f successful in the elec-",48
NA,"tions, repeal those sections dealing with",48
NA,the special deposit accounts. A state-,48
NA,ment was made clearly and definitely,48
NA,about the Commonwealth Bank Act-,48
NA,not the Banking Act-an d it was made,48
NA,He in these terms- I quote from page 759 of,48
NA,"Hansard, for the 21st March, 1945. I",48
NA,"quote it, not to comment on it, but to",48
NA,"repeat it, and to say that it still repre-",48
NA,sents our view. I t is as follows:-,48
NA,"Therefore, on behalf of my colleagues and",48
NA,"myself, I desire to make quite clear to the",48
NA,"House and to the people that, when we on",48
NA,this side of the chamber are returned to,48
NA,"office, we shall take prompt steps to restore",48
NA,"board control to the Commonwealth Bank,",48
NA,"free from political interference, and to secure",48
NA,a complete restoration of parliamentary,48
NA,authority i n this matter. I n every other,48
NA,respect we shall hold ourselves obliged in-,48
NA,stantly to review the working of this legisla-,48
NA,tion w i t h the object of bringing i t into line,48
NA,with what we believe to be the stable require-,48
NA,ments of the people.,48
NA,"That was the only statement made, and",48
NA,it was made in relation to the Common-,48
NA,wealth Bank Act. A l l who were here,48
NA,during those debates would at once agree,48
NA,with me in that. The statement had no,48
NA,"relation to the Banking Bill of 1945, con-",48
NA,sequently the suggestion that some,48
NA,"portions of the 1945 Banking Act, which",48
NA,I said were unchallenged and unchal-,48
NA,"lengeable, were the subject of a promise",48
NA,by me on behalf of the Opposition is,48
NA,fantastic. Nothing has been said at any,48
NA,time on behalf of the Opposition which,48
NA,would shake the operation or authority,48
NA,of those provisions of the Banking Act,48
NA,of 1945 which enable the central bank,48
NA,to control banking policy. The more,48
NA,clearly that appears to the public mind,48
NA,the more abundantly will i t appear that,48
NA,"this piece of legislation, which seeks to",48
NA,"go far beyond the Banking Act of 1945,",48
NA,is not based on some doubt which,48
NA,attaches to the 1945 legislation: I t is,48
NA,deposit based on a desire to go beyond the control,48
NA,"of policy, and reach out to the control of",48
NA,"the individual, in his individual trans-",48
NA,"actions with the bank. That, of course.",48
NA,is what makes Part VII . important. I,49
NA,am indebted to the Minister for,49
NA,Informatio n f o r having emphasized,49
NA,"that Part VII . , which seeks to",49
NA,prohibit the carrying on of banking,49
NA,"business by private banks, may stand by",49
NA,itself. I do not know whether i t is too,49
NA,"long ago fo r some of us to remember, but",49
NA,I hope that honorable members w i l l recall,49
NA,"that clause 6, which has already been",49
NA,passed by the committee,49
Mr FALSTEIN ,A s i t has been passed,49
NA,the right honorable gentleman should,49
NA,mention i t .,49
Mr MENZIES , W e had no time,49
NA,mention i t . I did not impose the,49
NA,limi t on the debate on this b i l l ; the,49
NA,party to which the honorable mem-,49
NA,ber f o r Watson belongs did that.,49
NA,"Consequently, the Opposition",49
NA,had opportunity to concentrate its,49
NA,attention only on certain matters. Clause,49
NA,"6 contains a simple provision, the effect",49
NA,of which is that this legislation is,49
NA,operate even i f only a portion of i t,49
NA,declared invalid and even i f that portion,49
NA,is found to have quite a different effect,49
NA,from that which the Parliament thought,49
NA,it had when i t was passed. Clause,49
NA,reads-,49
NA,I t is hereby declared to be the intention of,49
NA,the Parliament-,49
NA,(c) that this section and section fifteen,49
NA,A of the Acts Interpretation,49
NA,1901-1941 shall have effect notwith-,49
NA,standing that their operation,49
NA,result in this Act having an,49
NA,"different, or apparently different,",49
NA,in substance from the effect,49
NA,provisions contained in this Act in,49
NA,the form in which this Act,49
NA,enacted by the Parliament.,49
NA,I ask honorable members to work i t,49
NA,for themselves. What i t means is that,49
NA,this is deemed to be the intention of,49
NA,Parliament even i f i t was not the,49
NA,tion of the Parliament at the time the,49
NA,"bill was passed. Remembering that, let",49
NA,"us recall, as the Minister properly",49
NA,"minded us, that i f every other portion",49
NA,this measure is rejected as the result of,49
NA,some judicial process except Part VII,49
NA,"that part, by virtue of the provision",49
NA,"which I have just read, w i l l stand by",49
NA,"itself, and standing by itself i t w i l",49
NA,"stitute authority f o r the Government,",49
NA,"lotice published i n the Gazette, to",49
NA,quire any private bank to cease opera-,49
NA,tions. There is no mention of any com-,49
NA,pensation. The notice goes to the bank,49
NA,and the bank goes out of business. Here,49
NA,is a perfect charter fo r a banking,49
NA,monopoly by the simple and inexpensive,49
NA,process of crushing all competitors by,49
NA,notice published in the Gazette. It,49
NA,would be a great mistake i f anybody,49
NA,"listening to this debate, or reading the re-",49
NA,"port of i t hereafter, were to suppose that",49
NA,the major element i n that problem is the,49
NA,not terms and conditions on which compen-,49
NA,sation is to be paid to the shareholders,49
NA,of the private banks. Let us say once,49
NA,to more that their interest is a minor,49
NA,time matter; the real point about the,49
NA,monopoly bank is that i t will afford the,49
NA,means by which all industry and enter-,49
NA,prise may be controlled. The monopoly,49
NA,has,49
NA,bank may exercise that control by the,49
NA,"simple process of saying, "" To you I shall",49
NA,give credit; f r o m you I shall withdraw,49
NA,"to it. To you I refuse banking facilities,",49
NA,"is for this, that, or some other reason; to",49
NA,"you I grant them."" So, a government",49
NA,with a totalitarian outlook and a com-,49
NA,"pletely socialist concept, may give effect",49
NA,6 to that concept through the banking,49
NA,monopoly irrespective of whatever other,49
NA,provisions may exist in our Constitution.,49
NA,I t wearies me to hear honorable mem-,49
NA,"bers opposite say, "" We have no desire",49
NA,to nationalize the coal-mining industry;,49
NA,Act we have no desire to nationalize the steel,49
NA,"may industry"" . A government which has a",49
NA,effect single banking monopoly under its instant,49
NA,"responsive hand, may control all the",49
NA,"of the activities of Australia, great or small.",49
NA,"was Indeed, i t may say to any industry,",49
NA,""" Unless you conform to our require-",49
NA,"ments, you go out of business; you shall",49
NA,out have no banking accommodation unless,49
NA,you are prepared to go on to the black,49
NA,the market for the money you require or the,49
NA,"intenaccommodation you need "". That is the",49
NA,"very heart of this monopoly bill, and be-",49
NA,"cause i t is so, Part VII . will give to the",49
NA,reGovernment the opportunity to give,49
NA,of effect to all its desires and ambitions to,49
NA,"control individual industries i n Australia,",49
NA,". , great and small. Indeed, the smaller the",49
NA,industry the more easily i t w i l l be pos-,49
NA,sible to control i t . I t may very well be,49
NA,"l conimagined that I , f o r one, am indebted",49
NA,by to the Minister f o r Informatio n for,49
NA,rehaving reminded us-an d very properly-,49
NA,that we are not here concerned with a,50
NA,few dry-as-dust provisions. Far from i t ;,50

NA,element in the most disastrous piece of,50

NA,able member for Warringah suggested,50
NA,that appointees selected for elevation to,50
NA,tbe High Court Bench by a Labour,50
NA,"government would be so venal, crooked",50
NA,and corrupt as to do the bidding of the go-,50
NA,vernment which appointed them. The,50
NA,thing that amazes me is the great con-,50
NA,fidence of every honorable member,50
NA,opposite that this legislation will be,50
NA,jected by the High Court before which its,50
NA,validity may be contested. The honor-,50
NA,able member for Warringah has expressed,50
NA,the opinion that it is the intention of,50
NA,the Labour Government to stack the High,50
NA,Court to give effect to this legislation.,50
NA,"In other words, he believes that the",50
NA,Labour Government aims to appoint,50
NA,to the High Court additional justices,50
NA,favorably disposed to Labour's policy in,50
NA,order to secure a majority decision in,50
NA,favour of the banking legislation. I f,50
NA,"that charge could be substantiated, there",50
NA,would be clear evidence that at the,50
NA,moment the High Court is stacked,50
NA,against the Labour Government.,50
NA,The Leader of the Opposition has con-,50
NA,stantly referred to the intention of the,50
NA,Government to establish a banking,50
NA,monopoly. Such a monopoly already,50
NA,exists to-day. The Minister for Infor-,50
NA,mation ( Mr Calwell) made that clear,50
NA,when he reminded us that although,50
NA,normally there are nine private banks in,50
NA,"this country they, in fact, constitute a",50
NA,"monopoly, because they work to one",50
NA,"policy, and have an association in which",50
NA,is discussed matters fundamental to their,50
NA,interests. I t is utter rot to suggest that,50
NA,there will be any detrimental change,50
NA,in banking practice as affecting l i e,50
NA,individual member of the community,50
NA,"as the result of this proposal, be-",50
NA,"cause, when people are dealing with",50
NA,"a government bank, the directors of",50
NA,which are not linked up with other,50
NA,"it monopolistic concerns, individual appli-",50
NA,cants will receive better and more just,50
NA,treatment than they have been able,50
NA,to obtain from the private banks. Listen-,50
NA,"ing to the Leader of the Opposition, one",50
NA,would imagine that the directors of the,50
NA,private banks in Australia were interested,50
NA,solely in banking. The private financial,50
NA,institutions to-day have the very power,50
NA,over industry and individuals which the,50
NA,right honorable gentleman said i t would,50
NA,be wrong to confer upon the Government.,50
NA,"This bill will not create such power,",50
NA,because it already exists in the hands,50
NA,"of those institutions, but will merely",50
NA,transfer it to the elected government of,50
NA,the country.,50
NA,I shall give some illustrations of the,50
NA,interlocking of directorates in order to,50
NA,show that bank directors are interested,50
NA,re- in other activities than the business of,50
NA,"banking. Sir Frederick Tout, M.L.C.,",50
NA,besides being chairman of directors of the,50
NA,"Bank of New South Wales, is a director",50
NA,of the Australian Mutual Provident,50
NA,Society and a vice-president of the,50
NA,"Graziers Association. Mr J. H . Fairfax,",50
NA,a director of the Bank of New South,50
NA,Wales,50
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I rise to order.,50
NA,There is nothing in the two parts of the,50
NA,bill now before the committee relating to,50
NA,directors. The two parts are headed,50
NA,"respectively, "" Assessment of Compensa-",50
NA,"tion "", to which the subject of directors",50
NA,"is not related, and ""Prohibition of the",50
NA,Carrying on of Banking Business by,50
NA,"Private Banks"". I submit that the",51
NA,"-qualifications of directors, their personal",51
NA,"^activities and so forth, have no relation",51
NA,whatever to these two parts.,51
NA,'subject is related to the parts that the,51
NA,committee discussed last week.,51
The CHAIRMAN , I do not think,51
NA,that the banks have ever been carried on,51
NA,without directors. The Minister might,51
NA,be able to connect his remarks with the,51
NA,bill. The two matters before the Chair,51
NA,are as stated by the honorable member,51
NA,"for Barker, but I think that the Minis-",51
NA,ter's remarks have reference to Part,51
NA,dealing with the taking over of the,51
NA,private banks.,51
Mr WARD,Tha t is correct. I am,51
NA,stating reasons why private banking,51
NA,should be prohibited in Australia.,51
Mr MENZIES ,W e are back in the,51
NA,second-reading' debate.,51
The CHAIRMAN ,Order !,51
NA,Leader of the Opposition has had liberal,51
NA,treatment.,51
Mr MENZIES ,Tha t is the effect of,51
NA,"your ruling, Mr Chairman-tha t we are",51
NA,back in the second-reading debate.,51
Mr WARD , I shall explode the argu-,51
NA,ment of the Leader of the Opposition that,51
NA,the Government proposes to establish a,51
NA,monopoly in banking for the first time,51
NA,in Australia. The fact is that a,51
NA,monopoly already exists in the field of,51
NA,"private banking and, until the Common-",51
NA,wealth Bank Board was abolished by the,51
NA,"legislation of 1945, the monopoly even",51
NA,embraced the Commonwealth Bank as,51
NA,well. The Commonwealth Bank Board,51
NA,was under the domination of the private,51
NA,bank interests. I return to J. H .,51
NA,"Fairfax, a director of the Bank of New",51
NA,South Wales. Although the Sydney,51
NA,Morning Herald persists in contradicting,51
NA,"me on this point, my information is that",51
NA,Mr Fairfax is connected with that news-,51
NA,paper. He is also a director of the Aus-,51
NA,"tralian Mutual Provident Society, a",51
NA,"director of J. Fairfax and Sons Pty. Ltd.,",51
NA,and a director of the Royal Insurance,51
NA,Company Limited. Martin Mcllrath is,51
NA,a director of the Bank of New South,51
NA,Wales and also is associated with,51
NA,"Mcllrath's Holdings, the North-west",51
NA,"Pastoral Company, Macs Limited,",51
NA,"Homes Limited, and Myuna Proprietary",51
NA,"Limited. Mr H . D. Giddy, chairman of",51
NA,the National' Bank of Australasia,51
NA,"Limited, is also vice-chairman of the",51
NA,Herald and Weekly Times Limited and,51
NA,That a director of the Australian Newsprint,51
NA,"Mills. Sir Frank G. Clarke, M.L.C., the",51
NA,gentleman who caused the election in,51
NA,"Victoria, is a director of the National",51
NA,"Bank of Australasia Limited, a director",51
NA,of Goldsbrough Mort Limited and a,51
NA,local director of the Australian Mutual,51
NA,"Provident Society. G. J. Coles, a director",51
NA,of the National Bank of Australasia,51
NA,"Limited, is chairman of directors of",51
NA,"VII . , G. J. Coles and Company. Sir Clive",51
NA,"MCPherson, a director of the National",51
NA,"Bank of Australasia Limited, is manag-",51
NA,ing director of Younghusband Limited,51
NA,and was appointed a member of the Com-,51
NA,monwealth Bank Board in 1940.,51
NA,According to the Leader of the Opposi-,51
NA,"tion, when a person applies for an ad-",51
NA,vance under our existing private bank-,51
NA,"The ing system, the decision of the bank con-",51
NA,cerned is governed by the sheer merit of,51
NA,the application. I wonder how many,51
NA,"people in Australia believe that, i f a man",51
NA,wanted to open a grocery store next door,51
NA,to one of Mr Mcllrath's established and,51
NA,"flourishing stores, the decision of the",51
NA,Bank of New South Wales on his appli-,51
NA,cation for an advance would not be,51
NA,affected by the fact that Mr MCHrath is,51
NA,one of its directors ? I t is sheer rot to say,51
NA,that a member of the community to-day,51
NA,ean establish his own business and con-,51
NA,duct it in his own way. Monopolies de-,51
NA,termine the prices at which he may sell,51
NA,his goods. We have had illustration after,51
NA,illustration of this fact. I f a trader is,51
NA,satisfied to have a quick turnover at a,51
NA,smaller return on each item than is cus-,51
NA,"tomary, he is told by the monopolies that",51
NA,if he cuts prices wholesale supplies,51
NA,"will be withheld from him. Nevertheless,",51
NA,the Leader of the Opposition declared in,51
NA,his second-reading speech and at the,51
NA,meeting which he addressed in the Sydney,51
NA,"Town Hall that he was concerned, not",51
NA,for the few shareholders in the private,51
NA,"banks, but for the great majority of",51
NA,"people, the depositors, the plain citizens",51
NA,in the community. I t has been very,51
NA,evident i n this discussion that honorable,51
NA,members opposite are concerned in the,51
NA,"preservaton of the power, and influence",51
NA,exercised by the private banking institu-,51
NA,tions. When anti-Labour parties have,51
NA,"had the opportunity to govern, they have",52
NA,"done so only i n a secondary degree, he-",52
NA,cause they have merely carried out in this,52
NA,Parliament the policies that have been,52
NA,determined by the private financial,52
NA,interests.,52
NA,The honorable member for Warringah,52
NA,is very anxious to please those who have,52
NA,"briefed him in this case. I recollect how,",52
NA,"only last week, great exception was taken",52
NA,to a remark made by the honorable mem-,52
NA,"ber for Dalley ( Mr Eosevear), when he",52
NA,referred to the members of the Opposition,52
NA,"as "" paid agents of the private banks"".",52
Mr ROSEVEAR , I qualified that.,52
Mr WARD ,Ar e they not the paid,52
NA,agents of the banks ?,52
Mr ROSEVEAR , I said they were not,52
NA,"worth "" two bob "".",52
Mr WARD ,A s the honorable mem-,52
NA,"ber has said, i f some honorable members",52
NA,opposite were paid according to their,52
NA,"merits, they would receive very little.",52
NA,Judging by some of the speeches they,52
NA,"have made on this measure, they would",52
NA,not be worth very much to the banks.,52
NA,"Collectively, as an opposition, they repre-",52
NA,sent particular interests in this Parlia-,52
NA,"ment, and they are out to defend them.",52
NA,I n my opinion they are the paid agents of,52
NA,the private banks. I do not regard,52
NA,seriously the names that the Leader,52
NA,of the Opposition throws across this,52
NA,chamber at members of the Government.,52
NA,He talks about the danger of fascism,52
NA,in Australia. I am amazed at his,52
NA,"audacity. I guarantee that, i f a national",52
NA,""" quiz "" were held in Australia to-night",52
NA,and a competitor were asked to name the,52
NA,"greatest Fascist i n the country, he would",52
NA,want only one chance to answer the ques-,52
NA,tion. He would name the Leader of the,52
NA,"Opposition. Prior to the Avar, the right",52
NA,honorable gentleman was continually,52
NA,singing the praises of the Nazi and,52
NA,"Fascist forms of government, and talking",52
NA,about the great benefits that they bestowed,52
NA,upon the workers of Germany and Italy.,52
NA,"We know these things, and therefore we",52
NA,do not worry when the right honorable,52
NA,gentleman hurls such names across the,52
NA,chamber. The people of Australia know,52
NA,how to assess his worth.,52
NA,I hope that the honorable member for,52
NA,Warringah will not prove to be accurate,52
NA,in his prediction that the High Court is,52
NA,sure to throw out this legislation.,52
Mr SPENDER , I have said nothing of,52
NA,the sort.,52
Mr WARD ,Th e honorable member,52
NA,did so by inference.,52
Mr SPENDER ,No t by inference or,52
NA,otherwise.,52
Mr WARD ,"B y inference, he said,",52
NA,when addressing an old ladies' gathering,52
NA,"at Palm Beach, that the High Court was",52
NA,sure to reject the legislation of the Labour,52
NA,"Government. Let me put this proposition""",52
NA,"to him. I f the Labour Government',",52
NA,believed that its legislation would be-,52
NA,"approved by the High Court, there wouldi",52
NA,"be no need for any suggestion of "" stack-",52
NA,"ing "" the court. Is not the mere sugges-",52
NA,tion that the Labour party would have to>,52
NA,stack the High Court i n order to,52
NA,guarantee the implementation of its legis-,52
NA,lation an indication that the honorable,52
NA,member is already convinced that the,52
NA,court will reject the legislation? I do,52
NA,not know where the honorable member,52
NA,gets his information although he does,52
NA,move in circles where he may be able,52
NA,to find out the intention of certain,52
NA,gentlemen in regard to this Govern-,52
NA,ment's legislation,52
The CHAIRMAN ,Order ! The Min-,52
NA,ister's time has expired.,52
Mr HOLT ,Fawkner) [9.20] -Th e,52
NA,committee has been listening once again,52
NA,to that old familiar refrain which trips,52
NA,so readily from the lips of the Minister,52
NA,for Transport ( Mr Ward). We all,52
NA,"remember that when, speaking on the",52
NA,"second reading of this measure, the Min-",52
NA,ister said that he had waited twenty years,52
NA,"to make that speech, my colleague, the",52
NA,honorable member for Richmond ( Mr.,52
NA,"Anthony) pointed out, very aptly, that",52
NA,it was the same speech that the Minister,52
NA,had been making for the last twenty,52
NA,years. I t was the same familiar diatribe,52
NA,"against the High Court, and the same",52
NA,familiar stuff about directors of various,52
NA,companies and how directorates are inter-,52
NA,locked. Whilst the speech was all nause-,52
NA,atingly familiar to members of this,52
NA,"Parliament, I propose to deal with one",52
NA,"or two aspects of i t because, after all,",52
NA,the broadcasting of our proceedings is,52
NA,"still something of a novelty, and there",52
NA,"are, perhaps, those who may be misled",52
NA,by the specious arguments that the Ministheir,53
NA,ter puts forward. The honorable gentleviduals,53
NA,man challenged the honorable member,53
NA,for Warringah ( Mr Spender) on his,53
NA,"statement about "" p a c k i n g "" the H",53
NA,Court Bench. I do not propose,53
NA,devote very much time to,53
NA,Those who listened to the Minissome,53
NA,ter's speech a few nights ago heard,53
NA,him support everything that,53
NA,been said by the honorable member for tralian undertaking.,53
NA,Dalley ( Mr Rosevear). Those,53
NA,who are familia r w i t h the speeches of,53
NA,"Minister f o r Transport know how, time",53
NA,"after time over the years, he has said that",53
NA,the H i g h Court should not stand i n,53
NA,way of what he has described as,53
NA,""" majority will of the people of",53
NA,"tralia "" . I think I can f a i r l y say",53
NA,that is the way that the Minister,53
NA,pressed his sentiments. Since we have successful,53
NA,"been referred to the events of 1945,",53
NA,the hanking legislation passed through,53
NA,"Parliament at that time, I remind the",53
NA,Minister of a speech that he made i n the satisfaction.,53
NA,Sydney Domain-on e of his more popuearned,53
NA,"lar stamping grounds-i n July. 1945,",53
NA,when he said this-,53
NA,We can add to the High Court: we can put,53
NA,men there who are more sympathetic to the,53
NA,people. We should not hesitate to see that,53
NA,will of the people is not thwarted by those,53
NA,are not sympathetically minded towards them.,53
NA,Yet the honorable gentleman asks what,53
NA,authority we have for saying that Labour,53
NA,"will "" stack "" the Hig h Court i f i t",53
NA,chance. The honorable member for,53
NA,Dalley has said that he would not object,53
NA,"to i t , and the Minister f o r Transport,",53
NA,"many occasions, has given his approval to",53
NA,such a course. There is ample support,53
NA,for our view i n what has happened-in,53
NA,regard to the conciliation commissioner,53
NA,"system, and the other partisan appoint-",53
NA,ments that this Government has made,53
NA,"ever since i t took office, some years ago.",53
NA,"I wish to refer now, for a moment,",53
NA,this almost paranoiac tendency,53
NA,Minister to refer to company,53
NA,as if to be' a director of some,53
NA,or commercial enterprise in,53
NA,"were, prima facie, a crime in",53
NA,Apparently it has become a crime in this,53
NA,"country to be a success, because",53
NA,one analyses the careers of most of thosr,53
NA,men who are directors of our great instidoubt,53
NA,"tutions to-day, one finds that they are colleagues.",53
NA,mostly men who have made a successs of,53
NA,Mr Bolt.,53
NA,"lives. I n this country, few indi-",53
NA,start off w i th a hereditary advan-,53
NA,tage. I should estimate that to-day,53
NA,"per cent, of the men and women working",53
NA,"i g h in this country are employees, and that",53
NA,to of the remaining 10 per cent. 90 out of,53
NA,"that. every 100, either have been employees at",53
NA,stage of their lives or are the,53
NA,"children of those who, i n turn, were em-",53
NA,"had ployees, working f o r a wage i n some Aus-",53
NA,"So, why spread",53
NA,of us this class poison and attempt to divide,53
NA,the this country on class lines when no such,53
NA,lines should exist? This is a young coun-,53
NA,"try, and there is no place i n i t f o r the",53
NA,the poison and venorn that the Minister f o r,53
NA,the Transport and those who speak like,53
NA,Aushim try to inject into public life.,53
NA,that What crimes have these directors com-,53
NA,exmitted other than that they have been,53
NA,i n life-an d not entirely f r o m,53
NA,and personal motives. They are responsible,53
NA,"the t c their shareholders, and are removable",53
NA,by their shareholders i f they do not give,53
NA,I n the main they have,53
NA,the confidence of the people of,53
NA,Australia. This Government itself has,53
NA,no objection to the principle of director-,53
NA,"ships. I n fact, clauses 17, 18 and 19 of",53
NA,this bill provide that when the shares,53
NA,the in the private banks vest i n the Govern-,53
NA,"who ment, the Government shall immediately",53
NA,appoint its own directors to take up the,53
NA,guidance of those great financial institu-,53
NA,tions. I put i t to the people of this,53
NA,gets a country: To what body of men would,53
NA,they look f o r greater security and pro-,53
NA,gress-th e men who by virtue of their,53
NA,on experience and ability are i n control of,53
NA,"these financial institutions to-day, or the",53
NA,set of partisan supporters that this Go-,53
NA,vernment will appoint to these positions,53
NA,i f i t runs true to form ?,53
NA,The Opposition has been subjected to,53
NA,some criticism because when debating the,53
NA,"to 1945 legislation, we advocated a return",53
NA,of the to board control. That has been alleged,53
NA,"directors, against us as i f i t were some great weak-",53
NA,industrial ness in the policy of the Opposition,53
NA,Australia parties.,53
Mr CALWELL ,"Hear , hear!",53
Mr HOLT , T h e Minister for I n f o r -,53
NA,"mation says, "" Hear, hear!"" and no",53
NA,that will be echoed by some of his,53
Mr WARD ,"Hear , hear!",53
Mr HOLT ,"Including , of course, the",54
NA,Minister f or Transport.,54
Mr CHIFLEY ,Wh y does the Opposifor,54
NA,sition spend so much time opposing it?,54
Mr HOLT ,Th e Prime Minister the,54
NA,( Mr Chifley) asks why we spend to much,54
NA,"time opposing "" i t "". That is a very",54
NA,leading impression of what took place,54
NA,when two of the most important bills,54
NA,which up to that time had been presented,54
NA,to the Parliament were under discussion,54
NA,-th e Banking Act 1945 and the Comf,54
NA,monwealth Bank Act 1945. Why does sion's,54
NA,the Opposition spend so much time opposhe,54
NA,"ing "" i t "" asks the Prime Minister.",54
NA,spent a great deal of time opposing,54
NA,"ticular provisions of that legislation, and",54
NA,any body who cares to study the debates,54
NA,will see just where our opposition was,54
NA,"directed. Primarily, i t was directed",54
NA,against the bank control which permitted,54
NA,the executive Treasurer of the day to,54
NA,take from the Parliament its control over,54
NA,"banking policy, the note issue, and the",54
NA,extent of the gold reserves as a backing,54
NA,for the note issue. These were the things,54
NA,that we fought at that time. We were,54
NA,fighting for a Parliament that had,54
NA,exercised for centuries the privilege and,54
NA,responsibility of controlling financial,54
NA,policy i n this and other English-speaking,54
NA,countries; but the Prime Minister and,54
NA,"his rubber-stamp caucus behind him,",54
NA,surrendered the authority of the Parlia-,54
NA,ment. They handed that authority over,54
NA,"to the Treasurer of the day, who has no",54
NA,direct responsibility to report back to the,54
NA,Parliament on what he is doing. These,54
NA,"were the things that we were fighting,",54
NA,and when we specified that there should,54
NA,"be board control, we did so because we",54
NA,believed that there would be greater,54
NA,security and greater stability i f advice,54
NA,were given by a representative board of,54
NA,men-no t necessarily appointed f r o m one,54
NA,"side of politics, because I remind the",54
NA,mittee that there have been men member supported ignored.,54
NA,appointed to the Commonwealth Bank,54
NA,Board from all sections of the com-,54
NA,"munity, and f r o m all sides of the political",54
NA,arena. We felt that the collective,54
NA,dom of a representative body of men,54
NA,would ensure greater stability and,54
NA,security than would be the case i,54
NA,decisions were left solely to the Treasurer,54
NA,"of the day, and particularly a Treasurer",54
NA,who has developed illusions of grandeur,54
NA,"and who believes that, while the people",54
NA,"may desire to have a say i n what is best,",54
NA,"them, he knows what is best f or them",54
NA,and proposes to give i t to them regard-,54
NA,less of their wishes. I t was not merely,54
NA,view of an obstructive opposition that,54
NA,board control should remain; i t was also,54
NA,misthe view of the Royal Commission on the,54
NA,"Monetary and Banking Systems, and one",54
NA,to which the Treasurer himself sub-,54
NA,scribed. The right honorable gentleman,54
NA,did not hesitate to express his dissent,54
NA,r o m other aspects of the royal commis-,54
NA,report; but I have yet to learn that,54
NA,expressed any dissent f r o m the recom-,54
NA,We mendation that there should be board,54
NA,parcontrol of the Commonwealth Bank.,54
Mr CHIFLEY , I dealt with that very,54
NA,f u l l y i n the report. Let the honorable,54
NA,"gentleman deal with i t properly, too.",54
Mr HOLT , I f the right honorable,54
NA,gentleman now claims that he did dissent,54
NA,from the recommendation with respect to,54
NA,"board control, I can only say that no",54
NA,specific dissent was expressed i n the re-,54
NA,"port. But, conceding that the right",54
NA,"honorable gentleman did dissent, and",54
NA,that he was not i n favour of board con-,54
NA,"trol, the other six members of the royal",54
NA,commission were i n favour of board con-,54
NA,t r o l ; and they were a thoroughly repre-,54
NA,sentative body of men whose standing has,54
NA,not been challenged by any honorable,54
NA,member i n this debate. N o r could their,54
NA,"standing be challenged. For instance,",54
NA,one of them is now Chief Justice of the,54
NA,"State of South Australia, another is the",54
NA,head of a great Commonwealth depart-,54
NA,"ment, and another has been an adviser to",54
NA,"the Commonwealth, whilst the remainder",54
NA,have enjoyed a high reputation f o r their,54
NA,financial knowledge and ability i n this,54
NA,country.,54
Mr CHIFLEY , A n d whose recommen-,54
NA,comdations governments which the honorable,54
Mr HOLT , T h e Prime Minister,54
NA,tries to say that governments which I,54
NA,wissupported ignored the commission's,54
NA,recommendations. We never looked like,54
NA,ignoring them to anything like the de-,54
NA,f gree the Prime Minister is now doing.,54
NA,He has gone directly in the teeth of the,54
NA,"recommendation of the royal commission,",54
NA,that the best system for Australia is a,54
NA,system with a central government bank,54
NA,directing banking .policy associated witb,55
NA,"strong trading banks able to give, through",55
NA,"competition one with another, the best",55
NA,service to this country. That was the,55
NA,cardinal recommendation made by the,55
NA,"royal commission, and it is that recom-",55
NA,mendation that the Prime Minister and,55
NA,his colleagues have seen fit to flout in this,55
NA,legislation.,55
NA,"In the limited time at my disposal, the",55
NA,only other aspect I shall touch upon is,55
NA,the conscription of employees of the pri-,55
NA,vate banks which is to take place as the,55
NA,result of this legislation. The honorable,55
NA,"member for ""Warringah ( Mr Spender)",55
NA,".has already pointed out that, subject to",55
NA,"-one month's notice being given to them,",55
NA,"these employees, if they are declared to",55
NA,"'he redundant at any time, can be dis-",55
NA,charged from the service of the Common-,55
NA,'wealth. The rights which they have,55
NA,'built up in the private banking institu-,55
NA,tions which now employ them can be,55
NA,"destroyed over-night, and the only protec-",55
NA,tion they have is that they shall receive,55
NA,one month's notice. The Minister for,55
NA,Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman),55
NA,during the war and subsequently has,55
NA,"said that if the banks are nationalized,",55
NA,"6,000 banking employees could be re-",55
NA,leased for productive work. Having re-,55
NA,gard to what has happened in Great,55
NA,"Britain in recent days, we can see what",55
NA,a Labour government will turn to when,55
NA,it is confronted with difficulties so far as,55
NA,labour supply is concerned. From my,55
NA,knowledge of the Labour party in this,55
NA,"country, its statement that it would never",55
NA,engage in industrial conscription in,55
NA,peace-time cannot be relied upon. We,55
NA,have seen the socialist Labour Govern-,55
NA,ment in Great Britain turn to industrial,55
NA,"conscription in peace-time, and if corre-",55
NA,sponding difficulties arose in Australia,55
NA,there would be no greater restriction,55
NA,upon a socialist Labour government in,55
NA,this country than that which the present,55
NA,socialist Labour Government in Great,55
NA,Britain has found it necessary to impose,55
NA,"upon itself. So, we can take the pattern",55
NA,of what is being done with respect to em-,55
NA,ployees of the trading banks as exempli-,55
NA,fying what will be done in respect of,55
NA,employees in other industries which the,55
NA,Government may propose to nationalize,55
NA,in the future. The Government proposes,55
NA,to set up a permanent Federal Court of,55
NA,Mr Bolt.,55
NA,"Claims, to deal not merely with this issue,",55
NA,but also any other claims from an indus-,55
NA,try which may be socialized; and just,55
NA,as it has created machinery for this pur-,55
NA,"pose, we can take i t that its method of",55
NA,dealing with employees as exemplified,55
NA,in this legislation will be the same for,55
NA,dealing with employees in other indus-,55
NA,tries which are nationalized.,55
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Doe s the honorable,55
NA,member suggest that the Federal Court,55
NA,of Claims will do the Government's,55
NA,bidding?,55
Mr HOLT ,"No . Last week, in the",55
NA,"course of this debate, the honorable",55
NA,member for Dalley ( Mr Rosevear) said,55
NA,that the High Court had given a political,55
NA,decision i f ever one had been given. I,55
NA,have sufficient faith in the men who,55
NA,comply with the qualifications required,55
NA,by legislation before they can be,55
NA,"appointed to the judiciary, in whatever",55
NA,"aspect of judicial life it. might be, not",55
NA,to be swayed by such influence; they,55
NA,will be guided solely by the legal merits,55
NA,and justice of the issues coming before,55
NA,them.,55
NA,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,55
NA,( Mr Watkins) -Order ! The honorable,55
NA,member's time has expired.,55
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Dalley) [9.35] -,55
NA,There was one bright spot in the speech,55
NA,of the honorable member for Fawkner,55
NA,"( Mr Holt), and that was his assurance",55
NA,that he did not believe the Federal Court,55
NA,of Claims would do the Government's,55
NA,bidding. I shall show how widely diver-,55
NA,gent are the views expressed by two,55
NA,lawyers among honorable members oppo-,55
NA,site. The honorable member for Fawk-,55
NA,"ner, I repeat, in response to my inter-",55
NA,"jection, said that he did not believe the",55
NA,Federal Court of Claims would do the,55
NA,Government's bidding because he had,55
NA,sufficient faith in the qualifications of,55
NA,men eligible to be appointed to that,55
NA,court to believe that they would not do,55
NA,the Government's bidding. I refer,55
NA,further to another suggestion he,55
NA,made that the Government will put,55
NA,persons on the directorates of the private,55
NA,banks who will do the Government's,55
NA,bidding; and I refer again to the opinion,55
NA,expressed by the honorable member for,55
NA,Warringah ( Mr Spender) when he spoke,55
NA,"at Palm Beach the other night, and,",56
NA,according to a report published i n the,56
NA,Sydney Sunday Telegraph said-,56
NA,The Labour party aims to pack the High,56
NA,Court with men whose judgments would sup-,56
NA,port ail the acts,56
NA,He made no qualification-,56
NA,of a Labour government.,56
Mr SPENDER ,Tha t is so.,56
NA,Ml'. EOSEVEAR -Doe s the honor-,56
NA,able member admit that he said that?,56
Mr SPENDER ,"Unquestionably , I do;",56
NA,and I stand by i t .,56
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Th e honorable,56
NA,member said-,56
NA,The Labour party aims to pack the High,56
NA,Court with men whose judgments would sup-,56
NA,port all the' acts of a Labour government.,56
Mr SPENDER ,I f the honorable mem-,56
NA,"ber had his way, that is what he would",56
NA,do.,56
Mr ROSEVEAR , I do not think,56
NA,that any honorable member w i l l deny,56
NA,that men who would be qualified to be,56
NA,appointed to the H i g h Court would be,56
NA,men of the highest standing i n the legal,56
NA,profession; and that the opinion ex-,56
NA,pressed at a public meeting by the honor-,56
NA,"able member f o r Warringah, himself a",56
NA,"leading king's c'ounsel, means that among",56
NA,men i n the highest flight,56
NA,legal profession i n this country are men,56
NA,who are so corrupt and so venal that,56
NA,"they would,- in' return f o r appointment",56
NA,"to the H i g h Court, make any corrupt",56
NA,decision as members o'f that court that,56
NA,the Government which appointed them,56
NA,desired.,56
Mr SPENDER ,Th e only,56
NA,tion,56
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Ther e can be no,56
NA,qualification on this point. I n order to,56
NA,emphasize the honorable member's statei,56
NA,ment I shall repeat i t -,56
NA,The Labour party aims to pack the,56
NA,Court with men whose judgments would,56
NA,port all the acts of a Labour government.,56
NA,I f that isnot an insinuation that i n the',56
NA,highest flight of his own profession there,56
NA,are men so venal and corrupt that they for the defendant.,56
NA,would make any corrupt decision to,56
NA,satisfy the government that appointed,56
NA,"them, I do not know what he did mean;",56
NA,and I do not think that anybody else',56
NA,could know.,56
Mr SPENDER , I meant exactly what,56
NA,I said.,56
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Th e honorable,56
NA,member f o r Warringah has continually,56
NA,addressed us i n this chamber on the,56
NA,ethics of politics and the ethics,56
NA,of the legal profession. I n order,56
NA,"to test his credibility, I shall refer to",56
NA,one of the finest exhibitions of abuse of,56
NA,"ethics that has ever been given, i n a",56
NA,court i n New South Wales. I refer to,56
NA,the case of Sydney H y a m Davis v. W. J .,56
NA,"Smith, which was heard before Mr Jus-",56
NA,tice Street. I n that case the honorable,56
NA,member f o r Warringah appeared f or the,56
NA,p l a i n t i f f and i n his opening address he,56
NA,"referred to the defendant as, among",56
NA,others things-,56
NA,". . . a very slippery gentleman, efficient,",56
NA,"cunning, ruthless and with no sense of",56
NA,responsibility.,56
NA,He continued-,56
NA,"I have to reveal a man, who, through tortuous",56
NA,"methods with his associates, set out to destroy",56
NA,all competition with his own firm.,56
NA,Then he proceeded-,56
NA,Smith has ridden to wealth and power over,56
NA,the trampled remains of his associates and,56
NA,competitors. Gold is his God; power the,56
NA,shrine at which he worships.,56
NA,We have heard much about the ethics,56
NA,of the of the court and the legal profession. The,56
NA,"ethics of the court, i f indeed not its rule,",56
NA,are that counsel i n his opening speech,56
NA,"shall not make charges unless he hopes,",56
NA,"during the progress of the case, to seek to",56
NA,prove them. A f t er having made his,56
NA,"scandalous address, the honorable mem-",56
NA,ber f or Warringah disappeared f r o m the,56
NA,case and left i t to his junior counsel.,56
NA,qualifica-,56
Mr BURKE , H e thought that he was,56
NA,inthis chamber.,56
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Actuall y he was,56
NA,"n the court, where, I believe, his atten-",56
NA,dances are more regular than they are,56
NA,"High i n this chamber. Onthe 29th October,",56
NA,supthe case collapsed. The honorahle mem-,56
NA,NA,56
NA,NA,56
NA,"for a non-suit, and a verdict was entered",56
NA,"This question of ethics, I consider, is",56
NA,important because the honorable member,56
NA,for Warringah suggested that there are,56
NA,such people who may be placed on the',56
NA,H i g h Court who would be so venal and' 1,56
NA,corrupt as to do the Government's bidding.,57
NA,"I n his book. Law and Other Things, Lord",57
NA,MCMillan devotes a chapter to the ethics,57
NA,of advocacy. The honorable member,57
NA,for Warringah has devoted many chapters,57
NA,"of Hansard, to the same subject, but not",57
NA,with such good results to himself. Lord,57
NA,"MCMillan wrote, among other thinsrs-",57
NA,l or an advocate to allow charges to be,57
NA,r,57
NA,"launched with his name attached to them,",57
NA,"without the fullest investigation, would be to",57
NA,abuse tlie absolute protection against actions,57
NA,for slander which the law affords to counsel.,57
NA,Lord MCMillan proceeded-,57
NA,Counsel is not worthy of that protection,57
NA,unless he justifies i t by tlie most scrupulous,57
NA,"care in his written or oral attacks on Dalley, anyway.",57
NA,character.,57
NA,Counsel must insist upon being supplied,57
NA,with all the information which is sought by,57
NA,"his client to justif3 the attack, and then",57
NA,must decide for himself,57
NA,And this puts the onus on the honorable,57
NA,member for Warringah-,57
NA,whether the charges made arc such as can be,57
NA,justifiably made. I n exercising his judgment,57
NA,"in such a matter, the advocate is fulfillin g one",57
NA,of the most delicate duties to society which,57
NA,his profession casts upon him. I t is no small,57
NA,responsibility which the State throws upon,57
NA,the lawyer in thus confiding to his discretion,57
NA,the reputation of the citizen.,57
NA,No enthusiasm for his client's case-n o,57
NA,specious assurance from his client that the,57
NA,insertion of some strong allegations will,57
NA,coerce a favorable settlement-n o desire to,57
NA,"f o r t i f y the relevance of his client's case, entitles",57
NA,the advocate to trespass in matters involving,57
NA,reputation a hair's breadth beyond what the,57
NA,facts as laid before him and duly vouched and,57
NA,attested will justify. I t will not do to say,57
NA,lightly that i t is for the court to decide tlie,57
NA,matter. I t is for the counsel to see that no,57
NA,man's good uamo is wantonly attacked.,57
NA,"The honorable member for Warringah,",57
NA,"who lectures us so much, on the ethics of",57
NA,"banking and the ethics of law, so impugns",57
NA,the general character of leading members,57
NA,of his own profession as to assert that,57
NA,they would be capable of giving corrupt,57
NA,and untrue decisions in favour of the,57
NA,government which appointed,57
NA,merely because it had appointed them.,57
NA,"The honorable gentleman, in the case to",57
NA,"which T referred earlier, stopped at no",57
NA,lengths to defame the name of a man on,57
NA,"an assumption, and then walked out of",57
NA,the court and left it to his junior counsel,57
NA,to appeal for a non-suit. The judge,57
NA,rightly threw out that application. The,57
NA,honorable member for Warringah im-,57
NA,"puted most evil motives, made vile",57
NA,Mr Rox&near.,57
NA,charges and besmirched the reputation of,57
NA,a litigant; but so far from his adducing,57
NA,"proof to justify his attack, the case col-",57
NA,lapsed for the want of information or,57
NA,"proof. This is the gentleman, who at",57
NA,"Palm Beach a few days ago, sullied the",57
NA,good name of his profession.,57
Mr DALY ,Wher e is Palm Beach?,57
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Al l I can do is,57
NA,"to describe it as a "" narrow neck of land",57
NA,with calm water on one side and rough,57
NA,"water on the other "".",57
Mr SPENDER , I know on which side,57
NA,I should put the honorable member for,57
Mr ROSEVEAR, I have not the,57
NA,slightest doubt about that; and I have not,57
NA,he the slightest doubt that the press will,57
NA,r,57
NA,not give the same publicity to my exposure,57
NA,of the honorable member's ethics in,57
NA,law,57
NA,Mi . SPENDER - I do not mind if the,57
NA,1,57
NA,"press does, provided I am given the",57
NA,right to reply to the honorable member's,57
NA,"statements, by telling the truth.",57
Mr ROSEVEAR , I am sure that the,57
NA,newspapers will not give me the same,57
NA,write-up as they did to the famous speech,57
NA,which the honorable member for War-,57
NA,ringah delivered at Palm Beach a few,57
NA,nights ago.,57
Mr SPENDER ,Wha t has all this to do,57
NA,with the bill? The honorable member is,57
NA,only engaging in a slanderous attack on,57
NA,me.,57
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,57
NA,( Mr Watkins) -Order. ' I ask the,57
NA,"honorable member to remain silent, or",57
NA,he will be. named.,57
Mr ROSEVEAR ,W e can dispose of,57
NA,those people who preach so much of poli-,57
NA,tical ethics and legal ethics. We know,57
NA,"them for what they are worth, and we can",57
NA,"them, evaluate their criticism of the Govern-",57
NA,"ment, when they imply against the Go-",57
NA,"vernment the same "" crook"" motives as",57
NA,they imply against a defendant in the,57
NA,"court, produce no proof of them, and then",57
NA,slip out of the court and leave somebody,57
NA,else to clear up the mess.,57
NA,Reference has been made to the recom-,57
NA,mendations of the Royal Commission on,57
NA,"Monetary and Banking Systems. Indeed,",57
NA,the royal commission's report has been,57
NA,freely quoted during this debate. Mem-,58
NA,bers of the Labour party have been casti-,58
NA,gated because we did not follow the find-,58
NA,ings of the royal commission in their,58
NA,entirety. But when I look at the honor-,58
NA,able member fo r New England ( Mr .,58
NA,"Abbott), and realize that he was a",58
NA,"member of the commission, I wonder",58
NA,why honorable members opposite,58
NA,bothered to quote the commission's,58
NA,report at all. The one observation,58
NA,that I do desire to make before I,58
NA,conclude is this: I t is true that,58
NA,we have not carried out the findings of,58
NA,the royal commission i n their entirety;,58
NA,but i t is also true that our predecessors,58
NA,never adopted one of its recommendations.,58
NA,"The clauses now under consideration, I .",58
NA,"have no doubt, w i l l be passed by the com-",58
NA,"mittee. As I stated a few days ago, the",58
NA,Leader of the Opposition has a very,58
NA,"thin skin, and this evening he spoke, not",58
NA,to support the Opposition's general ease,58
NA,"against these clauses, but for the purpose",58
NA,of defending himself against the leading,58
NA,article in the Sydney Sunday Sun. That,58
NA,"article plainly and bluntly told him, and,",58
NA,"by implication, the Liberal party, that",58
NA,it was time that tliey made up their minds,58
NA,what attitude they would adopt towards,58
NA,the banking legislation of 1945.,58
Mr ADERMANN ,Wha t did the Sunday,58
NA,Sun say about the honorable member?,58
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Whateve r,58
NA,Sunday Sun said about me will gain f o r,58
NA,"me thousands of votes. To-night, the",58
NA,honorable member for Fawkner explained,58
NA,that his only objection to the banking,58
NA,legislation of 1945 was to the control by,58
NA,the Treasurer of the financial policy of,58
NA,the country. I f his choice as to who shall,58
NA,dominate the economic and financial,58
NA,policy of the country lies between the,58
NA,directors of the private banks and the,58
NA,"Government, I have not the slightest",58
NA,doubt what the people of Australia will,58
NA,have.,58
Mr HOLT ,Th e choice is between the,58
NA,Parliament and the Treasurer.,58
Mr ROSEVEAR , I f the choice as,58
NA,to who shall control the economic and,58
NA,financial policy of the country is between,58
NA,the Parliament and the people who are,58
NA,financially interested i n making profits,58
NA,"out of the private banks, I have not the",58
NA,slightest doubt about the one which the,58
NA,people will support.,58
Mr HOLT ,Th e choice is between the,58
NA,Parliament and the Treasurer. The,58
NA,honorable member should not make a,58
NA,mistake about that.,58
Mr ROSEVEAR ,A s I assessed the,58
NA,value of the honorable member's argu-,58
NA,"ment on the banking legislation of 1945,",58
NA,his opposition was not so much to the,58
NA,Treasurer having the final voice i n deter-,58
NA,mining banking and credit policy as i t,58
NA,was to the fact that that legislation,58
NA,abolished the Commonwealth Bank,58
NA,"Board, which was strangling the Com-",58
NA,monwealth Bank in the interests of the,58
NA,private banks.,58
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,58
NA,Order! The honorable member's time,58
NA,has expired.,58
Mr SPENDER , I desire to make a,58
NA,persona] explanation.,58
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,58
NA,What is the nature of the personal ex-,58
NA,planation that -the honorable member,58
NA,desires to make?,58
Mr SPENDER ,Th e honorable member,58
NA,"for Dalley ( Mr Rosevear), who at other",58
NA,time9 occupies the position of Speaker of,58
NA,"this chamber, has spent the major portion",58
NA,of the time allotted to him in alleging,58
NA,against me unethical conduct. I heard,58
NA,"him clearly, and I now want to give the",58
NA,"the facts to the committee, because this is the",58
NA,second occasion on which the honorable,58
NA,member has so accused me. The state-,58
NA,"ments ascribed to me are, I assume,",58
NA,perfectly correctly repeated. I t is,58
NA,correct that a non-suit was obtained. I t,58
NA,is equally correct that I was elsewhere,58
NA,during portion of that case. I t is,58
NA,"also correct, although the honorable",58
NA,"member for Dalley did not mention i t ,",58
NA,that the whole of the facts which he had,58
NA,taken up the time of the committee to,58
NA,mention to-night were placed with other,58
NA,facts before the highest tribunal of the,58
NA,"legal profession, on the complaint of the",58
NA,"informant, namely the Bar Council, and",58
NA,that my conduct was completely vindi-,58
NA,cated. The Speaker of this House has,58
NA,occupied ten minutes i n laying a charge,58
NA,against me when he should know better.,58
NA,"He has indulged i n personal abuse of me,",58
NA,although my conduct was completely,58
NA,vindicated by the highest tribunal in my,58
NA,profession.,58
Mr ANTHONY ,Richmond) [9.52] -,59
NA,The speech just delivered by the honor-,59
NA,able member for Dalley ( Mr Rosevear),59
NA,is of the kind that is becoming rather,59
NA,typical of his utterances. His method is,59
NA,to divert attention from the Banking Bill,59
NA,by making personal attacks upon leading,59
NA,figures of the Opposition. On the last,59
NA,previous occasion on which he resorted,59
NA,to such tactics he made a bitter personal,59
NA,attack on the Leader of the Opposition,59
NA,( Mr Menzies) in the course of which he,59
NA,said that there was in the right honor-,59
NA,"able gentleman "" a yellow streak a yard",59
NA,"wide and a foot thick "". I pay a tribute",59
NA,to the Leader of the Opposition for the,59
NA,way in which he has placed the case for,59
NA,the Opposition before the Parliament,59
NA,and the people in connexion with the,59
NA,high and important issues involved in,59
NA,this legislation. I f any man in this,59
NA,chamber has made a real sacrifice to serve,59
NA,his country i t is the Leader of the Oppo-,59
NA,sition. He has sacrificed earnings,59
NA,"amounting to probablv Â£10,000 a year.",59
NA,Compare his courage and ability with,59
NA,that of the man who attacked him 1,59
NA,Having spent the week-end licking the,59
NA,"wounds that he received last week, and",59
NA,brooding over the discredit he has,59
NA,"brought upon his own party, the",59
NA,honorable member for Dalley came into,59
NA,this chamber to-night and made a further,59
NA,personal attack-thi s time on the honor-,59
NA,"able member for "" Warringah ( Mr.",59
NA,"Spender), to whom he delivered a lecture",59
NA,on ethics. I f any one in this chamber,59
NA,ought to be lectured on that subject it,59
NA,is the Speaker of the House of Represen-,59
NA,tatives. Frequently honorable members,59
NA,on the Government benches say that we,59
NA,"on this side can "" give i t "" but we cannot",59
NA,""" take i t "" . To-night I propose to do",59
NA,"some ""giving"" , even i f in doing so I",59
NA,have to follow the line set by the honor-,59
NA,able member for Dalley. On the question,59
NA,"of ethics, an authority on the Constitu-",59
NA,tion and the judiciary says of Mr -before the chair.,59
NA,Speaker,59
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,59
NA,The honorable member must refer to the,59
NA,honorable member for Dalley by the name,59
NA,"of his constituency and not as "" Mr .",59
NA,"Speaker"".",59
Mr ANTHONY , I want to deal with,59
NA,the question of ethics on the highest,59
NA,possible plane. There are the ethics of,59
NA,"the judiciary, the ethics of the Parlia-",59
NA,ment and the ethics of the courts. On the,59
NA,"subject of the ethics of the Parliament,",59
NA,Bryce says-,59
NA,The note of the Speaker of the British,59
NA,House of Commons is his impartiality. He,59
NA,"has indeed been chosen by a party, because",59
NA,a majority means in England a party. But,59
NA,on his way from his place on the benches to,59
NA,the Chair he is expected to shake off and,59
NA,leave behind all party ties and sympathies,59
NA,The Speaker can lower or raise the tone,59
NA,and efficiency of the House as a whole by the,59
NA,way he presides over i t ; but a custom as,59
NA,strong as law forbids him to render help to,59
NA,"his own side, even by private advice. What-",59
NA,ever information as to parliamentary law he,59
NA,may feel free to give must he equally at the,59
NA,disposal of every member.,59
NA,That is the example set by the Mother,59
NA,"of Parliaments, but to-night the honor-",59
NA,"able member for Dalley, who at other",59
NA,times presides over the House of Repre-,59
NA,"sentatives as "" Mr Speaker "", indulged",59
NA,in an abusive attack on another honorable,59
NA,member. Could absurdity go further?,59
NA,I t has been said that there was no sug-,59
NA,gestion in the speech of the honorable,59
NA,"member for Dalley last week, or that of",59
NA,"the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward),",59
NA,that the Government intended to pack the,59
NA,High Court. Now that those two honor-,59
NA,able gentlemen have felt the strength of,59
NA,public opinion-the y had the week-end to,59
NA,reflect on what they had said-the y are,59
NA,trying to remedy the mischief that they,59
NA,have wrought. Let us consider some of,59
NA,the appointments made by the present,59
NA,Government to high judicial offices. I,59
NA,refer now to the recent life appointment,59
NA,of a member of the conciliation comis-,59
NA,sioners. These men will have complete,59
NA,powers over the several industries with,59
NA,which they will have to deal.,59
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , -,59
NA,The appointment of conciliation commis-,59
NA,sioners has nothing to do with the clause,59
Mr ANTHONY ," I realize, Mr Tem-",59
NA,"porary Chairman, that a fairly wide",59
NA,interpretation of the matter before the,59
NA,chair would be .needed to cover my,59
NA,"remarks, but I submit that considerable",59
NA,latitude has already been allowed to the,59
NA,"honorable member .for Dalley and, there-",59
NA,"fore, I trust that I may answer him.",59
NA,"Unless I do so, it will probably be as-",59
NA,"sumed that I , as the next speaker from",59
NA,"this side of the chamber, had no answer",60
NA,to give to the honorable member. Of,60
NA,the fifteen conciliation commissioners,60
NA,"recently appointed, fourteen were either",60
NA,union secretaries or supporters of the,60
NA,Labour party. That is not packing a,60
NA,judicial body! Included among them was,60
NA,"Mr Hamilton Knight, formerly Minis-",60
NA,ter for Labour in the MCGirr Govern-,60
NA,ment in New South Wales. Also in-,60
NA,cluded among them was the private,60
NA,"secretary of the Minister for Transport,",60
NA,Mr Donovan. An impartial judicial,60
NA,authority they are supposed to consti-,60
NA,tute! I am not now going to suggest,60
NA,anything about them other than this:,60
NA,There is not a man among them who has,60
NA,not spent a great part of his life either,60
NA,giving political decisions in favour of,60
NA,Labour or in advancing political,60
NA,policies in favour of Labour. I t is sug-,60
NA,gested that because certain people believe,60
NA,that their constitutional and legal rights,60
NA,are being violated by the legislation now,60
NA,"before the Parliament, and intend to",60
NA,"appeal to the High Court against it, they",60
NA,are doing so only because they know in,60
NA,advance what the decision of the court,60
NA,will be. What other course is open to,60
NA,"any person who feels aggrieved, whether",60
NA,he be the lowest labourer in the land or,60
NA,"the highest captain of industry, or the",60
NA,"representative of a bank, other than to",60
NA,appeal to the authority appointed by the,60
NA,"Constitution, namely, the High Court,",60
NA,"and after the High Court, to the Privy",60
NA,Council ?,60
NA,I n the speeches of the honorable mem- wrong in that?,60
NA,ber for Dalley and the Minister for,60
NA,"Transport, they have clearly shown their",60
NA,hand. They first said that some of the,60
NA,"judges of the High Court were senile,",60
NA,and that the appointments of all judges,60
NA,should terminate upon their reaching a,60
NA,"specified age. Then, when the honor-",60
NA,able member for Barker ( Mr Archie,60
NA,"Cameron), on Thursday night last, moved",60
NA,that members of the Federal Court,60
NA,of Claims should be appointed with,60
NA,"a retiring age of 65 years, the",60
NA,"honorable member for Dalley, who",60
NA,"first espoused such a proposal, walked",60
NA,out of the chamber. He was not,60
NA,game to have his name recorded in,60
NA,Hansard as voting in support of the pro-,60
NA,posal which he claimed to favour.,60
NA,The Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley) ex-,60
NA,cused himself for proposing to appoint,60
NA,"the judges for life on the ground that,",60
NA,"under the Constitution, there was no",60
NA,"authority to do anything else. Well, i f",60
NA,"that be so, why have leading government",60
NA,spokesmen tried to discredit and besmirch,60
NA,"the members of the High Court, knowing",60
NA,all the time that there was no power to,60
NA,do anything about it? I f it is really de-,60
NA,sired to introduce a retiring age for,60
NA,"judges in the Commonwealth judiciary, it",60
NA,can be done by altering the Constitution,60
NA,with the consent of the people. Let the,60
NA,Government submit its proposals to the,60
NA,"highest tribunal in the land, namely, the",60
NA,people themselves. With an air of great,60
NA,"bravado, the Government proposes to sub-",60
NA,mit to the people next year certain pro-,60
NA,posals in regard to prices control. I t will,60
NA,say to the people that i t needs more,60
NA,power in order to protect their interests.,60
NA,I t will have courage enough to do that-,60
NA,"to use this word "" courage "", of which the",60
NA,honorable member for Dalley is so fond.,60
NA,The Government will have the courage,60
NA,"to go before the people in February next,",60
NA,"and ask for more power to control prices,",60
NA,but it has not the courage to invite the,60
NA,opinion of the people on this banking,60
NA,legislation.,60
NA,We on this side of the chamber have,60
NA,been criticized by the Prime Minister,60
NA,and his minions for our defence of the,60
NA,Commonwealth Bank Board. We have,60
NA,been twitted because we have said that,60
NA,if we were returned to power we would,60
NA,re-appoint the board. Is there anything,60
Mr WARD ,Yes .,60
Mr ANTHONY ,Th e Minister for,60
NA,Transport says that our proposal is,60
NA,wrong. Let me quote from a speech by,60
NA,"Mr W. C. Taylor, who, I understand,",60
NA,was federal pesident of the Australian,60
NA,Labour party.,60
Mr WARD ,"No , he was not.",60
Mr ANTHONY ,"Well , he was senior",60
NA,vice-president.,60
Mr CALWELL ,Wron g again.,60
Mr ANTHONY ,Thi s man was the,60
NA,Government's nominee on the Common-,60
NA,wealth Bank Board before i t was,60
NA,abolished. He was the Government's,60
NA,nominee on the Australian National,60
NA,"Airlines Commission, and the ' con-",60
NA,fidential adviser to the Prime Minis-,60
NA,ter. This is what he said at a,60
NA,meeting of the Henry Lawson Labour,61
NA,"College, held i n the Trades H a l l , as re-",61
NA,ported i n the Sydney Morning Herald,61
NA,of the 27th September-an d the 3peech,61
NA,was made since this legislation was intro-,61
NA,duced i n Parliament-,61
NA,Nationalization should be discussed on an,61
NA,"economic rather than a political level, said",61
NA,Mr Taylor. Labour supporters were too prone,61
NA,to discuss economic problems with a cliche:,61
NA,"that the banks caused the depression, that the",61
NA,banks kept people out of work. These state-,61
NA,ments were quite untrue. . . .,61
NA,The nationalized bank should he controlled,61
NA,by a board or commission comprising repre-,61
NA,sentatives of all interests.,61
NA,I t will be seen that he proposes to re-,61
NA,constitute the controlling authority which,61
NA,the Prime Minister and the Minister for,61
NA,"Transport, and other honorable members",61
NA,"opposite, have described as an anachro-",61
NA,nism. I have no more to say other than,61
NA,this: When the honorable member f o r,61
NA,Dalley is next tempted to lecture on t h t,61
NA,"ethics that should, guide honorable mem-",61
NA,"bers of this Parliament, I suggest that",61
NA,he himself should read more carefully,61
NA,"May's Parliamentary Practice. Then, i f",61
NA,"he still feels the need of further reading,",61
NA,let him study Quick and Garran on the,61
NA,Constitution.,61
Mr ROSEVEAR , I desire to make,61
NA,"personal explanation, because I have been",61
NA,misrepresented by the honorable member,61
NA,for Richmond ( Mr Anthony).,61
NA,mind how he criticizes what I say; but,61
NA,his statement that I walked out of the,61
NA,chamber when a vote was taken on the,61
NA,amendment of the honorable member f o r,61
NA,Barker ( Mr Archie Cameron) is untrue.,61
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Th e honorable,61
NA,member did not vote.,61
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Th e statement,61
NA,that I walked out of the chamber and did,61
NA,not vote. The fact is that I was not i n,61
NA,the chamber during the discussion on the,61
NA,amendment. I have never voted i n the,61
NA,House or i n committee since I have been,61
NA,"Speaker. Furthermore, I will never",61
NA,stupid enough to vote f o r something that,61
NA,is not worth the paper i t is written upon.,61
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne-Ministe,61
NA,for Informatio n and Minister f o r I m m i -,61
NA,gration [10.7] - Mr Temporary Chair-,61
NA,man,61
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I rise to,61
NA,order. I have observed that during the,61
NA,debate this afternoon the honorable mem-,61
NA,ber f o r Reid ( Mr Lang) has risen to,61
NA,"speak, but he was not called. H e is not",61
NA,"an official member of the Labour party,",61
NA,but he is more bitterly opposed to my,61
NA,opinions than are many members of that,61
NA,"party. Nevertheless, I believe that he",61
NA,should be heard i n this debate.,61
Mr HOLT , O n a point of procedure.,61
NA,I understand that some honorable mem-,61
NA,"bers on the Government side, and possibly",61
NA,"on this side also, have been called twice,",61
NA,while other honorable members who have,61
NA,tried to speak have not been called at a l l .,61
NA,I understand that the practice i n com-,61
NA,mittee is that no honorable member shall,61
NA,be given a. second call unti l all other hon-,61
NA,orable members who desire to speak,61
NA,have had an opportunity to do so.,61
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,61
NA,"( Mr Watkins) -Afte r I took the chair,",61
NA,"the first call, was given to the",61
NA,honorable member f o r Dalley ( Mr .,61
NA,"Rosevear). He caught my eye, and",61
NA,"I called him. A fte r him, the call went to",61
NA,tlie honorable member f o r Richmond,61
NA,"( Mr Anthony). ""When he finished, the",61
NA,honorable member f o r Reid ( Mr Lang),61
NA,and the Minister f o r Informatio n ( Mr .,61
NA,Calwell) rose together. I assumed that,61
NA,a the Minister was representing the Prime,61
NA,Minister as Minister i n charge of the hill,61
NA,"at the moment, and therefore had a right",61
NA,I do not to reply to criticism.,61
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Bu t he has,61
NA,already spoken.,61
Mr CALWELL , I shall not detain,61
NA,"the committee very long, but I want to",61
NA,reply to some of the criticism,61
Mr HOLT , I raised a point of pro-,61
NA,"was cedure, and referred to what I under-",61
NA,stand has been a practice of long stand-,61
NA,ing i n committee. The Minister f o r I n -,61
NA,formation is not in charge of the bill. The,61
NA,Prime Minister is i n his place i n the,61
NA,"committee. He is i n charge of the bill,",61
NA,be and any honorable member who wishes,61
NA,to speak f o r the first time on the clauses,61
NA,now before the committee is entitled to,61
NA,receive the call before any other honor-,61
NA,r able member is called a second time.,61
The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ,,61
NA,Order! The Chair has already given,61
NA,the call to the Minister f o r Information.,61
Mr CALWELL , T h e debate this even-,61
NA,ing has been responsible for two things.,61
NA,"First, i t brought f o r th a statement by",62
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies),62
NA,that the Opposition-an d I assume the,62
NA,right honorable gentleman,62
NA,both of the parties i n Opposition-,62
NA,still stands on the statement he made i n,62
NA,connexion with the Commonwealth Bank,62
NA,B i l l of 1945; i t still wants the Common-,62
NA,wealth Bank controlled by the Common-,62
NA,wealth Bank Board. Our objection to,62
NA,that is as solid to-day as ever i t was;,62
NA,"it goes right back to 1924, when the support",62
NA,former Leader of the Australian Country,62
NA,"party, the right honorable member for",62
NA,"Cowper ( Sir Earle Page), who was then",62
NA,"the Leader of the "" rump "" party, withand",62
NA,"out a mandate f r o m the people, imposed",62
NA,upon this national Parliament the bankstands,62
NA,ing policy of the Country party.,62
NA,"are opposed to the control of the destinies clause, taken",62
NA,of the people by a Commonwealth Bank,62
NA,Board because i n effect i t means control,62
NA,of an instrumentality of the people,62
NA,representatives of the private .banks,62
NA,whose desire is to make the Commonposititious,62
NA,wealth Bank a bankers' bank. We want,62
NA,the bank to be the people's bank. On,62
NA,previous occasion I cited the instance,62
NA,one member of the Commonwealth Bank in,62
NA,"Board, Sir Clive MCPherson, who reThe right honorable",62
NA,signed a. directorship on the National,62
NA,Bank of Australasia Limited to become,62
NA,member of the Commonwealth Bank carry,62
NA,"Board, but who, when we decided that",62
NA,"we no longer wanted his services, went",62
NA,straight back from the Commonwealth,62
NA,Bank Board to his former position on,62
NA,the directorate of the National Bank of,62
NA,Australasia Limited. The Opposition,62
NA,says that i t stands for that kind of thing.,62
NA,I am indebted to the Leader of the OppoSpeaking,62
NA,sition fo r the frankness with,62
NA,has expressed his case. As'a matter of,62
NA,"fact, everybody seems to be indebted to",62
NA,somebody else to-night. The Leader of,62
NA,the Opposition expressed his indebtedness,62
NA,to me for some references I had made over the individual.,62
NA,to clause 46. The Minister for Trans-,62
NA,"port ( Mr W a r d ) , who followed",62
NA,"right honorable gentleman, expressed",62
NA,indebtedness to the Leader of the Oppoment,62
NA,sition for some legal opinions which,62
NA,had given i n the course of his remarks.,62
NA,The second statement made by the,62
NA,Leader of the Opposition was one for,62
NA,which we are also indebted to the right,62
NA,the honorable gentleman. I did not take down,62
NA,his words verbatim but as far as I recall,62
NA,"he said, speaking for the Opposition-",62
NA,includes We have not said that we do not support,62
NA,the Banking Act of 1945.,62
NA,"That is, as distinct fro m the Common-",62
NA,.m on wealth Bank Act of 1945 the right,62
NA,honorable gentleman has resorted to the,62
NA,old technique of using the double nega-,62
NA,"tive, leaving i t to be inferred that the",62
NA,Opposition i n this Parliament does now,62
NA,"the bill of 1945, but not saying so",62
NA,in. unequivocal language. I hope that be-,62
NA,fore the committee finally disposes of this,62
NA,"clause he wil l say i n positive language,",62
NA,not i n a phrase containing a double,62
NA,"negative, just where the Opposition",62
NA,i n regard to that legislation. He,62
NA,We then went on to say that i f this,62
NA,"by itself, were to",62
NA,"stand, and irrespective of whatever else",62
NA,"in the bill may be declared ultra vires,",62
NA,by it would enable the Government to do,62
NA,many things. He conjured up a sup-,62
NA,case which nobody with the,62
NA,"slightest intelligence would believe, that",62
NA,a notwithstanding a declaration of i n -,62
NA,of validity i n respect of every other clause,62
NA,the bill this clause could still stand.,62
NA,gentleman is,62
NA,setting up annt-sallys merely to knock,62
NA,a them down again. Those tactics do not,62
NA,conviction with those who analyse,62
NA,this subject. The right honorable gentle-,62
NA,man also said that this clause gives to,62
NA,the Government power to intrude into,62
NA,the most private banking affairs of every,62
NA,"citizen. Let us see what Mr MCConnan,",62
NA,one of the bankers directing the opposi-,62
NA,"tion campaign to this bill, has had to say.",62
NA,i n respect of the 1945 legisla-,62
NA,which he tion Mr MCConnan said-,62
NA,"Government control over the banking system,",62
NA,"which meaii6 control over tlie people's money,",62
NA,would permanently give the Government vjist,62
NA,powers over industry and substantial control,62
NA,Mr MCConnan said that i n respect of,62
NA,the the 1945 legislation. The Leader of the,62
NA,his Opposition now brings the same argu-,62
NA,forward as a reason why the 1947,62
NA,he legislation should not be passed. He,62
NA,affirms i n a double negative phrase that,62
NA,the Opposition now has no objection to,62
NA,the Banking Act of 1945 about which Mr .,62
NA,MCConnan so graphically and extensively,62
NA,expressed his fears. These are the same,62
NA,fears which the Leader of the Opposi-,63
NA,tion now expresses about the 1947 legisla-,63
NA,tion. Mr MCConnan continued-,63
NA,This would place in the government's hands,63
NA,a powerful control not only over industry as,63
NA,a whole but over the economic and financial,63
NA,ambitions of every individual.,63
NA,The Leader of the Opposition now,63
NA,attempts to terrorize the customers of the,63
NA,banks by using the same arguments w i th,63
NA,which Mr MCConnan failed to impress,63
NA,the people about the 1945 legislation.,63
NA,When i n 1911 the Labour party brought,63
NA,forward its first banking bill much the,63
NA,same attempt was made to blackmail the,63
NA,people into accepting the arguments,63
NA,used i n the Opposition campaign.,63
NA,When i n 1911 Mr Fisher intro-,63
NA,"duced his Commonwealth Bank B i l l ,",63
NA,a measure which i n succeeding years,63
NA,Opposition members began to hold,63
NA,up as a perfect piece of legislation which,63
NA,we should support and beyond which we,63
NA,"should not go, the Sydney Morning",63
NA,Herald i n its issue of the l 7 t h Novem-,63
NA,"ber, 1911, had this to say-",63
NA,The bank is to be pitted against all other,63
NA,"banks, with intent to displace them, and the",63
NA,better i t succeeds the sooner may private and,63
NA,State concerns be invited to put up their,63
NA,shutters. This is really little better than a,63
NA,"species of wholesale confiscation, and i t should",63
NA,be resisted to the last ditch.,63
NA,We have heard of fights to the last ditch,63
NA,prophesied by the Opposition i n con-,63
NA,nexion w i th this bill.,63
Mr WARD ,Th e second battle for,63
NA,Australia.,63
Mr CALWELL , A s I am reminded,63
NA,"by my colleague, the fight against this",63
NA,bill has been referred to as the second,63
NA,battle f or Australia. Whenever a pro-,63
NA,gressive Labour Government introduces,63
NA,progressive legislation i n connexion w i th,63
NA,banking the same extravaganza of mis-,63
NA,representation and distortion takes place.,63
NA,The dire happenings prophesied by the,63
NA,Opposition i n 1911 did not come to pass.,63
NA,The f r i g h t f u l consequences that were,63
NA,prophesied to follow the Banking A c t,63
NA,"of 1945, which we are told the Opposi-",63
NA,"tion parties now approve, did not come",63
NA,to pass. Yet the same arguments are,63
NA,advanced against the 1947 legislation.,63
NA,Let us see what one distinguished mem-,63
NA,her of the community had to say on the,63
NA,question of banking. I refer to Pro^,63
NA,"fessor Walter Murdoch, of the University",63
NA,"of Western Australia, now a very old",63
NA,man. A f t e r dealing w i th the question of,63
NA,banking i n the Melbourne Herald and i n,63
NA,other newspapers-som e other news-,63
NA,papers which regularly printed his syn-,63
NA,dicated articles would not prin t this one,63
NA,-Professo r Murdoch had this to say-,63
NA,"My conclusion, not come to all of a sudden",63
NA,"nor without due thought, is that our money",63
NA,system-th e regulation of the issue and recall,63
NA,of currency and credit on a rational .and,63
NA,"scientific basis-i s far too important, far too",63
NA,vital to tlie welfare of all of us to be left to,63
NA,private profit making firms. I t is the con-,63
NA,cern of the nation. We talk of responsible,63
NA,governments; if there is one thing a respon-,63
NA,"sible government ought to be responsible for,",63
NA,it is surely this.,63
NA,That is a very sound statement f r o m the.,63
NA,viewpoint of the average citizen. I t,63
NA,epitomises the Government's viewpoint.,63
NA,We are not desirous of destroying i n -,63
NA,dustry which we ourselves helped to,63
NA,create. We are not anxious to destroy the,63
NA,"solvency of the country, f or which we",63
NA,alone are responsible. We are not,63
NA,"anxious to upset the lives of the people,",63
NA,who to-day are not oppressed by the fear,63
NA,"that they had during the depression, the",63
NA,fear that they would not be able to get,63
NA,work. I f the workers of Australia are,63
NA,"to lose any freedom under this b i l l, i t",63
NA,will be only the freedom to starve. We,63
NA,are tryin g to ensure that they shall not,63
NA,suffer f r o m that fear of want that so,63
NA,"many-a t least 700,000 workers at one",63
NA,"time and 400,000 workers at another",63
NA,time-suffered .,63
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Wh y is the,63
NA,Minister addressing his remarks to his,63
NA,own supporters?,63
Mr CALWELL ,Becaus e I regard,63
NA,the honorable member as being com-,63
NA,pletely hopeless. I t is of. no use f o r me to,63
NA,cast my pearls i n certain directions.,63
NA,When we nationalize the banks and,63
NA,"when we rationalize banking procedure,",63
NA,i t may be found by the Commonwealth,63
NA,Bank authorities that the trading banks',63
NA,"shareholders have been making, not only",63
NA,"an inordinate profit overall, but also a",63
NA,profit i n certain directions in which they,63
NA,should not have been allowed to profit,63
NA,at all. I refer to the payment of ex-,63
NA,"change on cheques, a charge to which",63
NA,every person livin g i n the country areas,63
NA,"is subject, whereas city residents are",63
NA,largely exempt. When the Common-,64
NA,wealth Bank Board takes control of,64
NA,"banking in this country, exchange may be",64
NA,"eliminated. I f so, there will be a great",64
NA,saving to the primary producers. Fur-,64
NA,"thermore, when the Commonwealth Bank",64
NA,takes charge of banking in this country,64
NA,it will probably be found possible to,64
NA,reduce interests rates on rural indebted-,64
NA,"ness, and perhaps on housing loans, in the",64
NA,interests of people living in both the city,64
NA,"and the country, to a far greater",64
NA,degree than ever before.,64
NA,"Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, we tried",64
NA,to translate into legislative actuality,64
NA,something that had been a part of our,64
NA,platform for many years. On the Labour,64
NA,"party's platform we had this statement,",64
NA,""" The financing by the Commonwealth",64
NA,Bank at the actual cost of issuance and,64
NA,"services of public work"". The legal",64
NA,"draftsmen, when they interpreted our",64
NA,"wishes in the legislation, provided",64
NA,that loans should be made for housing,64
NA,"purposes at "" the lowest practicable rate",64
NA,"of interest"". That was the desire of the",64
NA,Parliament and of the nation. I n my,64
NA,"view, a rate near 2 per cent, would be",64
NA,desirable. Some day we shall get down,64
NA,"to that rate, but we shall not be able to",64
NA,do so while we have nine trading banks,64
NA,cluttering the way. The sooner we get,64
NA,rid of those banks the sooner shall we be,64
NA,able to govern the nation in the interests,64
NA,of the whole population.,64
Mr LANG ,Eeid) [10.23] - I refer,64
NA,"to clause 46, sub-clause (1), which",64
NA,reads-,64
NA,(1.) Notwithstanding anything contained,64
NA,"in any other law, or in any charter or",64
NA,"other instrument, a private bank shall not,",64
NA,"after the commencement of this act, carry",64
NA,on banking business i n Australia except as,64
NA,required by this section.,64
NA,I move-,64
NA,"That, in clause 46, sub-clause (1.),",64
NA,"word "" section"", tlie following words be in-",64
NA,"serted:-""provid e that such prohibition shall",64
NA,not apply to co-operative banks constituted in,64
NA,accordance with the rules governing the estab-,64
NA,"lishment of co-operative societies, such co-",64
NA,operative banks for the purposes of this act,64
NA,"not being regarded as private banks.""",64
NA,"In moving that amendment, I desire to",64
NA,say that co-operative banking is in,64
NA,accordance with the fundamental prin-,64
NA,ciples of the Labour movement. I t is also,64
NA,an absolute safeguard to the Labour,64
NA,movement. I t is a protection against,64
NA,monopoly control of banking by anti-,64
NA,Labour governments. Honorable mem-,64
NA,bers know that nowhere has the co-,64
NA,operative movement flourished more than,64
NA,on the coal-fields of our country. There,64
NA,the co-operatives have acted as banks for,64
NA,the miners during every major indus-,64
NA,trial crisis. Without the co-operative,64
NA,"banks, the miners would have lost every-",64
NA,industrial battle that they fought from,64
NA,I n the the time of the notorious leg-irons to the,64
NA,present date. What would have happened,64
NA,had anti-Labour governments been in,64
NA,power during those disputes i f the present,64
NA,bill had been in operation? During their,64
NA,disputes the miners have invariably sur-,64
NA,vived because of the credit extended to,64
NA,them by the co-operative movement. The,64
NA,co-operative societies work on bank over-,64
NA,drafts. They also virtually operate as,64
NA,"banks, creating their own form of credit",64
NA,which they supply in order to protect the,64
NA,"miners and their families. However, a",64
NA,"hostile anti-Labour government, under",64
NA,"this bill, could stop the credit of the co-",64
NA,"operatives and, by calling up the over-",64
NA,"drafts instead of extending them, apply",64
NA,economic pressure to the workers on the,64
NA,coal-fields and elsewhere.,64
NA,This bill assumes that the Common-,64
NA,wealth monopoly bank will always be-,64
NA,"a Chifley bank. Under this bill, i t might",64
NA,"at any time be a Menzies bank, a Casey",64
NA,"bank, or even a Thornton bank. What",64
NA,would have happened had this bill been in,64
NA,operation in the 'twenties? Then i t,64
NA,would have been a Bruce bank or a Page,64
NA,bank. What would have happened to the,64
NA,co-operatives on the coal-fields during in-,64
NA,dustrial disputes then? The first thing,64
NA,"would have been that the bank, by order",64
NA,"of the Government, would have called up",64
NA,their overdrafts and that would have been,64
NA,after the the end of the struggle. The Miners,64
NA,Federation could never have survived a,64
NA,crisis without the assistance that its mem-,64
NA,bers received from the co-operative,64
NA,"movement. Yet, unless provision is made",64
NA,"in this bill for the co-operative banks, all",64
NA,the co-operative societies in Australia,64
NA,will be at the mercy of any future,64
NA,anti-Labour government. The miners,64
NA,would not be able to last a month in an,64
NA,"industrial dispute because, under this bill,",64
NA,they would be beaten to their knees im-,65
NA,mediately. The Government and its sup-,65
NA,porters must realize that when they pass,65
NA,this bill they create a Menzies bank or a,65
NA,Casey bank. They will be giving the,65
NA,anti-Labour forces control by monopoly,65
NA,just as surely as they are creating a pass-,65
NA,ing Chifley monopoly. The Government,65
NA,appears to be blinded to the future just,65
NA,as it is to the past. Unless i t makes pro-,65
NA,vision for co-operative banks-an d I say,65
NA,this deliberately-i t will be forging the,65
NA,greatest weapon that the anti-Labour,65
NA,movement has ever had presented to it.,65
NA,These imion funds will be at the mercy,65
NA,of an anti-Labour banking monopoly.,65
NA,The Treasurer of the day will be able to,65
NA,freeze trade union funds. Think of what,65
NA,would have happened to the timber,65
NA,workers in 1929 i f other sections of the,65
NA,Labour movement had been unable to,65
NA,"come to their assistance, as they would be",65
NA,"unable to do when this bill becomes law,",65
NA,and an anti-Labour government takes,65
NA,charge of the treasury bench! Think of,65
NA,what the Bruce-Page Government could,65
NA,have done then! By making provision,65
NA,"for co-operative banks, this .Government",65
NA,could protect the trade unions of Aus-,65
NA,tralia and the Australian workers.,65
NA,Co-operative banks are not run for,65
NA,private profit nor are they run for,65
NA,the benefit of a few privileged,65
NA,"persons, but among the workers",65
NA,themselves. The Co-operative Whole-,65
NA,sale Society's Bank in England has,65
NA,been a most successful institution. It,65
NA,was started in 1872 by the society as a,65
NA,loan and deposit department. The co-,65
NA,operative movement in Great Britain,65
NA,then obtained an amendment of the act,65
NA,that made it possible to transform that,65
NA,department into a bank. That was in,65
NA,1876. Since then the co-operative move-,65
NA,ment of Great Britain has had its own,65
NA,"bank, conducted by its own members, and",65
NA,with directors elected by its members.,65
NA,The bank not only acts as a banker for,65
NA,the society itself; it acts as a banker for,65
NA,"11,866 trade union accounts. It acts also",65
NA,"for mutual organizations, as well as mem-",65
NA,bers of the co-operative movement and,65
NA,any one else who wishes to utilize its,65
NA,services. It is also banker for 95 local,65
NA,governing bodies. It has its head-quarters,65
NA,in Manchester and it has branches in,65
NA,"other cities, and agencies f>*"" receiving",65
NA,Mr Lang.,65
NA,deposits and cashing cheques in various,65
NA,co-operative institutions throughout the,65
NA,land. That Co-operative Bank is a safe-,65
NA,guard against monopoly banking in,65
NA,Great Britain. I t does not operate for,65
NA,the sake of private profits. I t pro-,65
NA,vides banking facilities at absolutely the,65
NA,minimum cost; but it does more than,65
NA,that. I t not only pays a high rate of,65
NA,"interest on deposit accounts, but it also",65
NA,"pays interest at the rate of l i per cent,",65
NA,on current accounts and that is something,65
NA,that neither the private banks nor the,65
NA,Commonwealth Bank has yet done. I f a,65
NA,worker deposits his money with the Corn-,65
NA,monwealth Bank in a cheque account he,65
NA,receives no interest on i t ; but the bank,65
NA,lends the money at a high rate of in-,65
NA,terest. I f the Co-operative Bank in,65
NA,Great Britain can pay interest on current,65
NA,"accounts, why cannot the Commonwealth",65
NA,Bank in Australia do likewise? The,65
NA,Commonwealth Bank is merely a replica,65
NA,of the private trading banks and it has,65
NA,"all their vices. I t is profit-hungry, and",65
NA,there is no guarantee under this measure,65
NA,that it will change its habits. Co-opera-,65
NA,"tive banks, operating in accordance with",65
NA,the principles of the co-operative move-,65
NA,"ment, would be conducted on altogether",65
NA,different lines. A co-operative bank,65
NA,would be a democratic institution and,65
NA,not a monopolistic institution. Trade,65
NA,union funds would be safe in a period,65
NA,"of industrial crisis, and the co-operati. e",65
NA,bank could extend credit just as the co-,65
NA,operative societies do to-day.,65
NA,I f the Government rejects this amend-,65
NA,"ment, it is not sincere in its attitude to",65
NA,fundamental Labour principles. Accord-,65
NA,"ing to its latest balance sheet, last year",65
NA,the Co-operative Bank in England had,65
NA,"a turnover of Â£1,311,000,000. Its assets",65
NA,"now amount to Â£473,000,000 and after",65
NA,"paying Â£500,000 in interest on current",65
NA,accounts it still showed a very substan-,65
NA,tial surplus for distribution amongst ics,65
NA,members. The co-operative movement,65
NA,regards banking as the bridge between,65
NA,production and distribution and that is,65
NA,the true function of banking. Many,65
NA,trade unions in this country have refused,65
NA,to bank with the Commonwealth Bank,65
NA,because they have been afraid of govern-,65
NA,ment interference at a time when they,65
NA,were engaged in an industrial struggle.,65
NA,That fear will be intensified unless the,65
NA,Government gives protection by making,66
NA,provision for co-operative banks.,66
Mr FRANCIS ,Wha t unions are they?,66
Mr LANG ,Practicall y all of them.,66
NA,Government supporters should ask themdestroys,66
NA,selves: What is going to happen to the,66
NA,accounts of the trade unions and Labour,66
NA,organizations when anti-Labour governmaking,66
NA,ments control the monopoly Commonwhich,66
NA,wealth Bank? Unless they vote,66
NA,for this amendment they will be making,66
NA,voting to hand over the funds of if,66
NA,the trade unions and the labour organiHigh,66
NA,zations to the enemies of Labour when,66
NA,the enemies of Labour are in power.,66
NA,hope that the Government will give,66
NA,"serious consideration to the amendment,",66
NA,"and for the sake of the trade unions,",66
NA,"workers and the co-operatives, I hope",66
NA,that the amendment will be accepted.,66
Mr ABBOTT ,New. England) [10.39].,66
NA,- I wish to say something to-night about,66
NA,the remarks made by the honorable memwent,66
NA,"ber for Dalley ( Mr Eosevear), who gave",66
NA,honorable members a lecture on ethics.,66
NA,The honorable member quoted Lord he,66
NA,"MCMillan, the distinguished English",66
NA,"lord, with regard to the ethics of",66
NA,"barristers, and then proceeded to comhonorable",66
NA,plain about the professional conduct of,66
NA,the honorable member for Warringah duct in the past.,66
NA,( Mr Spender). I t i l l became the honor-,66
NA,able member for Dalley to lecture any-,66
NA,body on ethics after his own unethical,66
NA,conduct in the labour movement in this,66
NA,country. The gross manner in which,66
NA,honorable member betrayed his predeparty,66
NA,"cessor in the electorate of Dalley, Mr.",66
NA,"E. G. Theodore, is not beyond the fact",66
NA,memory of members of this committee,66
NA,and of the public generally. The honorgot,66
NA,able member had been secretary to Mr.,66
NA,Theodore in the previous election camment,66
NA,"paign, and had learned the whole inner",66
NA,workings of the machine of that elecScullin,66
NA,torate. He then preceeded to stab in,66
NA,back the man he was supposed to support.,66
NA,I tell the Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley),66
NA,that neither the leopard nor the leper,66
NA,changes his spots: and there have been,66
NA,signs that the honorable member for,66
NA,Dalley is organizing the rank and file,66
NA,of the present Government to do the,66
NA,kindly deed towards him as he did tothe,66
NA,"wards Mr Theodore, when the latter",66
NA,"was the member for Dalley. So, it",66
NA,becomes this paragon of virtue to strut,66
NA,and parade himself in this chamber as,66
NA,one who should lecture other honorable,66
NA,members when we know that his history,66
NA,is the history of a political assassin who,66
NA,the people he is pledged to sup-,66
NA,port. The other night we witnessed the,66
NA,spectacle of the honorable member,66
NA,"an attack upon the High Court,",66
NA,is the highest judicial tribunal in,66
NA,this country. What was his reason for,66
NA,"that attack? He was determined,",66
NA,"possible, to lower the prestige of the",66
NA,Court in the eyes of the people of,66
NA,"Australia, or to terrify the members of",66
NA,I the court. He failed in both of those,66
NA,objectives. He did not lower the court,66
NA,the in the eyes of the people; and he did,66
NA,not terrify the members of the court.,66
NA,They will not be terrified by the idle,66
NA,threats of a. man like the honorable mem-,66
NA,ber for Dalley. I t i l l became him to do,66
NA,"what, he did. During the week-end he",66
NA,"to Sydney, and discovering the re-",66
NA,percussions of his speech against the Go-,66
NA,"vernment and against himself, personally,",66
NA,now returns and indulges in a torrent,66
NA,law of abuse of honorable members. The,66
NA,public of Australia can judge what the,66
NA,member for Dalley is worth by,66
NA,"his conduct in this chamber, and his con-",66
NA,The Minister for Information ( Mr.,66
NA,Calwell) said that the Commonwealth,66
NA,"Bank Board should not be re-established,",66
NA,the and that the objection of the Labour,66
NA,to a bank board is just as strong,66
NA,to-day as i t was in 1945 and 1924. The,66
NA,is that there are great gaps in the,66
NA,"memory of the Minister, because he for-",66
NA,to tell the committee that the Banking,66
NA,Bill introduced by the Scullin Govern-,66
NA,in 1930 provided for the reappoint-,66
NA,ment of a bank board. What did the,66
NA,Government do? I t was a Labour,66
NA,"the government, and we are told that Labour",66
NA,governments never change their views.,66
NA,The Minister did not tell the people that,66
NA,"the Scullin Government, not only pro-",66
NA,"posed to re-appoint the bank board, but",66
NA,"it also appointed Sir Robert Gibson, who,",66
NA,"to-day, is condemned by all honorable",66
NA,same members opposite as the arch enemy of,66
NA,"workers of this country, not for one",66
NA,"year but for seven years, and gave him",66
NA,i l l powers which the honorable members,66
NA,opposite say should not he given to any,67
NA,man. Honorable members talk about,67
NA,wanting a people's bank and not a,67
NA,bankers' bank. They try to mislead the,67
NA,"people by these phrases, because the",67
NA,central bank must be a bank for the trad-,67
NA,ing banks. The Royal Commission on,67
NA,Monetary and Banking Systems recom-,67
NA,mended that the Commonwealth Bank,67
NA,should also have the function of a trad-,67
NA,ing bank in order to enable it to discip-,67
NA,line the trading banks by active competi-,67
NA,tion with them in carrying out fully the,67
NA,functions of a trading bank.,67
NA,The Minister for Information talked,67
NA,about the setting up of a regional court,67
NA,of appeal to protect the interests of the,67
NA,man on the land. How would the man,67
NA,on the land obtain satisfaction from,67
NA,"such a court, provision for which is not",67
NA,"made even in this bill, although the Prime",67
NA,Minister referred to such a tribunal in,67
NA,his second-reading speech? How could,67
NA,the man on the land obtain satisfaction,67
NA,from such a court after his experience of,67
NA,having to wait month after month to,67
NA,obtain advances from the Commonwealth,67
NA,Bank to enable him to stock his land or,67
NA,to purchase implements and such articles,67
NA,as cornsacks for the handling of his,67
NA,crops? The Labour party is purely a,67
NA,"city-controlled party, which does not",67
NA,understand in the slightest degree the,67
NA,"requirements of the man on the land,",67
NA,when it puts forward such a superficial,67
NA,proposition as that and expects the man,67
NA,on the land to believe it. The Minister,67
NA,for Information also said that the trad-,67
NA,ing banks charged internal exchange,67
NA,"upon cheques. If that was such an evil,",67
NA,the Government has had two years to,67
NA,abolish it in respect of the transactions,67
NA,of the Commonwealth Bank; but it has,67
NA,not done anything in that direction. On,67
NA,the word of the Minister for Informa-,67
NA,"tion, the Government is thus guilty",67
NA,of gross insincerity. According to,67
NA,the Minister it has robbed the,67
NA,people of Australia by charging internal,67
NA,exchange on all cheques handled by the,67
NA,Commonwealth Bank. Then we have,67
NA,the proposition that with one monopoly,67
NA,bank the interest rate will be reduced to,67
NA,"2 per cent, or, indeed, to zero. There",67
NA,has not been anything to prevent the,67
NA,Commonwealth Bank from reducing the,67
NA,rate of interest below the present rate.,67
NA,Mr Abbott.,67
NA,As the Royal Commission on Monetary,67
NA,"and Banking Systems pointed out, the",67
NA,Commonwealth Bank reduced the rate,67
NA,of interest charged by all of the pastoral,67
NA,houses of Australia to a figure that was,67
NA,considerably lower than the rate pre-,67
NA,viously charged. The bank did that,67
NA,simply by making funds available,67
NA,"at a low rate of interest to two,",67
NA,"or three, pastoral houses, the remainder",67
NA,of those institutions being obliged to fall,67
NA,into line. There has been nothing to,67
NA,"prevent the Commonwealth Bank, which,",67
NA,since the passing of the 1945 banking,67
NA,"legislation, has been in the fullest com-",67
NA,"petition with the trading banks, from",67
NA,reducing the rate of interest and forcing,67
NA,all of the trading banks to come into,67
NA,"line. But i t did not do so. Is it likely,",67
NA,when it has a monopoly of banking in,67
NA,"the future, to behave differently from",67
NA,other monopolies? No. The monopoly,67
NA,bank will screw the people just as hard,67
NA,in the future as it has in the past.,67
NA,With regard to the amendment moved,67
NA,by the honorable member for Reid ( Mr.,67
NA,Lang) to provide for the establishment,67
NA,"of co-operative banks, we in the primary",67
NA,industries are vitally interested in such a,67
NA,"proposal. Probably, he has a much",67
NA,greater knowledge than I have of the,67
NA,operation of co-operative movements on,67
NA,the coal-fields and of the requirements,67
NA,of people living in those districts; but I,67
NA,say that in no industry in Australia has,67
NA,the co-operative movement taken deeper,67
NA,root than in the dairying industry. I n,67
NA,my own electorate and the adjoining,67
NA,"electorate of Robertson, there are two of",67
NA,the largest co-operative butter factories,67
NA,in Australia. One of those factories,67
NA,desired to extend its operations to a con-,67
NA,"siderable degree, and on being refused",67
NA,an advance for this purpose by one trad-,67
NA,"ing bank, i t obtained the accommodation",67
NA,it desired from another private bank. The,67
NA,"other establishment, the Singleton-Wara-",67
NA,"tah butter factory, wished to establish a",67
NA,selling floor in Sydney for its whole milk,67
NA,"trade, and when it failed to obtain accom-",67
NA,modation from one trading bank it ob-,67
NA,tained the accommodation it desired,67
NA,from another trading bank. No one,67
NA,engaged in primary industry believes,67
NA,"that economists and bureaucrats, who",67
NA,"possess only book learning, will be",67
NA,seized with the necessity for the establishinstrument,68
NA,ment of industries of that kind in dis-,68
NA,tricts where practical men know them to,68
NA,be essential. The economists and bureau-,68
NA,"crats, live in the detached air of Can-",68
NA,"berra, far removed from the scenes",68
NA,"where, in blood and sweat, the farmers",68
NA,produce the food to feed the world.,68
NA,Do we think for a moment that we shall,68
NA,get any better accommodation in the,68
NA,establishment of our co-operative fac-,68
NA,tories from this monopoly institution,68
NA,"than we did in the past? Therefore, it",68
NA,is the duty of the Government to accept,68
NA,the amendment. I have great pleasure,68
NA,in supporting it.,68
Mr BEAZLEY ,Fremantle) [10.51] -,68
NA,I shall address most of my remarks to the,68
NA,amendment which the honorable member,68
NA,for Eeid ( Mr Lang) has moved in rela-,68
NA,tion to co-operative banking. I do not,68
NA,feel that in the volley of abstract nouns,68
NA,which the honorable member for New,68
NA,England ( Mr Abbott) discharged in the,68
NA,"House, there is very much to answer;",68
NA,but the honorable member for Eeid has,68
NA,"discussed a problem which, he states, will",68
NA,confront trade unions in the event of,68
NA,industrial disputes when this bill is,68
NA,passed. The political career of the honor-,68
NA,able member may be summed up in the,68
NA,"-expression ""right wing actions and left",68
NA,"wing slogans "". I feel that to-night, in",68
NA,advancing one of the arguments that the,68
NA,"private banks have put forward, he has",68
NA,borne out that striking feature of his,68
NA,political career. I f a trade union is on,68
NA,-strike in defiance of an arbitration court,68
NA,"award, and i f the Government, in order",68
NA,"to enforce that award, passes legislation",68
NA,"impounding its funds, i t is immaterial",68
NA,"whether the funds are in a private bank,",68
NA,the Commonwealth Bank or a State sav-,68
NA,ings bank. The power which this Go-,68
NA,vernment has to enforce laws with respect,68
NA,to industrial peace under the conciliation,68
NA,and arbitration power would enable i t,68
NA,to over-ride a private bank in precisely,68
NA,the same way as i t would over-ride the,68
NA,"-Commonwealth Bank. Therefore, in the",68
NA,main point of the honorable member's,68
NA,argument there is no merit whatever. I t,68
NA,"was advanced, of course, with the idea of",68
NA,alarming the trade unions with the,68
NA,thought that in the hands of the political,68
NA,"parties opposed to the Labour party, the",68
NA,"""Commonwealth Bank could be used as an",68
NA,against them. Even without,68
NA,"the nationalization of banking, the funds",68
NA,of a trade union in a private bank could,68
NA,be impounded by a government which,68
NA,was disposed to impound them. I make,68
NA,that point perfectly clear at the outset.,68
NA,"Under the Banking Bill, there will be",68
NA,no greater disadvantage to a trade union,68
NA,in the event of the Liberal party and the,68
NA,Australian Country party coming into,68
NA,power than under the present system.,68
NA,The second remark of the honorable,68
NA,member for Eeid related to the formation,68
NA,of co-operative banks. That i t was a,68
NA,phantasy is shown by the fact that in,68
NA,dealing with the subject of co-operative,68
NA,"banks, he cited English examples, and",68
NA,"then, by making play with the word "" co-",68
NA,"operative "", he spoke about how the co-",68
NA,"operative stores, although he did not use",68
NA,"the word "" stores "" but that was what he",68
NA,"meant, had carried various trade unions",68
NA,during strikes. He left us to infer that,68
NA,this was being done by co-operative banks,68
NA,"established by trade unions. Of course,",68
NA,there are no co-operative banks estab-,68
NA,"lished by trade unions in Australia, so",68
NA,that that particular phantasy which the,68
NA,honorable member brought forward to,68
NA,"bolster up his amendment, and to give",68
NA,him an excuse to echo in the name of the,68
NA,"left the slogans of the right, was as",68
NA,invalid as his suggestion that there was a,68
NA,menace to the trade unions in the bill in,68
NA,its present form.,68
NA,The clauses under consideration relate,68
NA,"to the assessment of compensation, and",68
NA,prohibit the private banks from carrying,68
NA,on banking business. I t is important to,68
NA,notice that the Federal Court of Claims,68
NA,will be staffed by judges with qualifica-,68
NA,tions equal to those of justices of the,68
NA,High Court. Sub-clause 2 of clause 40,68
NA,provides-,68
NA,"The amount of compensation payable shall,",68
NA,"unless agreed upon, he determined by the",68
NA,court and not in any other manner.,68
NA,Sub-clause 4 of the same clause pro-,68
NA,vides-,68
NA,Where a notice is given under the last pre-,68
NA,"ceding section in relation to any shares, the",68
NA,persons entitled to payment of compensation,68
NA,in respect to the acquisition of those shares,68
NA,shall be determined by the Court and not in,68
NA,any other manner.,68
NA,"Throughout these clauses, the absolute",68
NA,authority of the Federal Court of Claims,68
NA,is established by this bill. I desire to,68
NA,"make an observation upon that, because",69
NA,it has been the practice of the High,69
NA,"Court in the past, when determining",69
NA,"whether just compensation has been paid,",69
NA,to require only that there shall have been,69
NA,a judicial inquiry into compensation. I,69
NA,"wonder, however, whether one clause of",69
NA,"the bill will be found, upon challenge,",69
NA,to be valid. I refer to the clause which,69
NA,purports to cancel the right of appeal,69
NA,from the Federal Court of Claims to the,69
NA,High Court. Since the Constitution,69
NA,itself lays down that when the Common-,69
NA,"wealth acquires property, just compensa-",69
NA,"tion must be paid for it, the phrase",69
NA,""" just compensation "" being a part of the",69
NA,"Constitution, is a part which must be in",69
NA,-the jurisdiction of the only court which,69
NA,"can interpret the Constitution, and this",69
NA,"is the High Court. However, that is a.",69
NA,matter for lawyers to determine. ',69
NA,Statements have been made concerning,69
NA,the judicial appointments of the Govern-,69
NA,"ment, arid I desire to refer to them. The",69
NA,"Prime Minister ( Mr Chifley), in answer",69
NA,"to a question this afternoon, stated that",69
NA,in the period of six years during which,69
NA,"the Government has been in office, it had",69
NA,made only one appointment to the High,69
NA,"Court. That, of course, was the appoint-",69
NA,"ment of Sir William Webb, formerly",69
NA,"Chief Justice of Queensland. Last week,",69
NA,"and during a part of the debate to-day,",69
NA,the Government has been accused of in-,69
NA,tending to pack the High Court. When,69
NA,I asked purely objective questions of the,69
NA,Prime Minister to-day concerning state-,69
NA,ments which the honorable member for,69
NA,Warringah ( Mr Spender) made as,69
NA,statements of fact that the Government,69
NA,"intended to pack the High Court, the",69
NA,honorable member said that it was a,69
NA,fair inference. There is a name well,69
NA,"known to lawyers given to people who, in a",69
NA,"court of law, elevate their inferences into Brennan, F.",69
NA,"statements of fact. Now, this denuncia-",69
NA,tion of the appointment of the Govern-,69
NA,"ment either means nothing, or is an",69
NA,attack on the former Chief Justice of,69
NA,"Queensland, Sir William Webb, the only",69
NA,appointee of the Government to the,69
NA,High Court. If the High Court,69
NA,"is to be packed, the Government",69
NA,"must amend the Judiciary Act, which",69
NA,now provides for the appointment to the,69
NA,High Court of only seven judges. The,69
NA,seventh judge-again I emphasize that,69
NA,Mr Beazley.,69
NA,this is the only appointment that this,69
NA,Government has made-wa s appointed in,69
NA,"April, 1946. He had been the Chief",69
NA,"Justice of Queensland, and before",69
NA,that a highly qualified and re-,69
NA,spected lawyer. The assertions about,69
NA,packing the High Court are either,69
NA,an attack on Sir William Webb or,69
NA,"gaseous nonsense, and the people, know-",69
NA,"ing the calibre of that judge, can ascer-",69

NA,TOBACCO.,71
Mr CHIFLEY ,"O n the 4th November,",71
NA,the honorable member for Indi ( Mr.,71
NA,MCEwen) asked a question regarding,71
NA,tobacco production in Australia. The,71
NA,Minister for Commerce and Agriculture,71
NA,has supplied the following informa-,71
NA,tion :-,71
NA,The successful development of tobacco leaf,71
NA,production in Australia is dependent on a,71
NA,number of factors and i t is considered that the,71
NA,most important of these are the provision of,71
NA,irrigation facilities in suitable growing areas,71
NA,and the control of crop pests and diseases.,71
NA,The return which the grower will receive for,71
NA,"his crop is of importance also, but even high",71
NA,prices cannot compensate a producer whose,71
NA,yields have been seriously depleted by lack of,71
NA,water and the ravages of insects or other pests.,71
NA,The provision and extension of irrigation,71
NA,works and assistance to producers generally,71
NA,are matters for the governments of the pro-,71
NA,ducing States. The Commonwealth Govern-,71
NA,ment has assisted the States from time to time,71
NA,in making grants available to supplement,71
NA,work being done in connexion wit h production,71
NA,problems. Last year the Commonwealth ap-,71
NA,"proved of a grant of Â£10,000 per annum for a",71
NA,five-year period on a Â£1 for Â£1 basis to be,71
NA,allocated amongst the producing States of,71
NA,"New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and",71
NA,Western Australia for experimental and,71
NA,demonstration work in connexion with tobacco-,71
NA,"leaf production, particularly in regard to the",71
NA,control and elimination of diseases and pests.,71
NA,I n addition the Council for Scientific and I n -,71
NA,dustrial Research is engaged upon research,71
NA,work connected w i t h the problems of the,71
NA,tobacco industry. On the subject of prices,71
NA,"for tobacco leaf, attention is directed to a",71
NA,recent announcement by the Minister f o r,71
NA,Commerce and Agriculture that the prices to-,71
NA,be paid to growers are to be increased by tlie,71
NA,"3,099 payment of specific premiums based upon the",71
NA,"1,579 appraisal values placed on leaf. I t is expected",71
NA,that these additional payments w i l l stimulate-,71
NA,54 production in the industry and particularly,71
NA,reward the output of better quality leaf.,71
NA,Other steps which might be taken to assist,71
NA,.. 29 towards a greater production of Australian,71
NA,leaf are under examination and the Minister,71
NA,for Commerce and Agriculture w i l l take the-,71
NA,". . 1,480 opportunity of discussing this question with",71
NA,.. 209 the State Ministers for Agriculture at the-,71
NA,next meeting of the Australian Agricultural,71
NA,.. 1 Council.,71
NA,170 POWER KEROSENE.,71
NA,.. 106,71
Mr HOLLOWAY ,O n the 13th Novem-,71
NA,"105 ber, the honorable member for Swan ( Mr.",71
NA,Hamilton) asked a question concerning,72
NA,tlie supply of power kerosene to primary on,72
NA,producers. The Minister for Supply and ploitation,72
NA,Shipping has supplied the following parations,72
NA,information:-,72
NA,Although power kerosene is in global short,72
NA,"supply, there is at present no rationing of",72
NA,power kerosene in Western Australia or any,72
NA,"other State, nor has there been any shortage",72
NA,of stock of power kerosene i n Western Aus-,72
NA,"tralia, but i t is of course possible that on",72
NA,occasions due to transport and other diffi-,72
NA,culties a temporary local shortage of stock,72
NA,may have occurred. I n such cases the local,72
NA,"oil company agent would, of course, be com-",72
NA,pelled to ration his customers. I t is con-,72
NA,sidered that the local man is best able to deal,72
NA,fairly in such a situation and i t is obviously,72
NA,his own best interests to ensure an equitable,72
NA,distribution of the stocks available. The Go-,72
NA,vernment has no immediate intention of,72
NA,"rationing power kerosene, but should future",72
NA,"circumstances make such action necessary, 1",72
NA,can assure the honorable member that all due,72
NA,regard will be paid to the requirements of that,72
NA,product for both primary producers and all,72
NA,other essential users.,72
NA,CAKE TINS.,72
Mr HOLLOWAY ,O n the 12th Novem-,72
NA,"ber, the honorable member for Deakin",72
NA,( Mr Hutchinson) asked a question con-,72
NA,cerning the supply of tinplate for cake,72
NA,tin lids. The Minister for Supply and,72
NA,Shipping has supplied the following in-,72
NA,formation :-,72
NA,Owing to the shortage of supply of tinplate,72
NA,the manufacture of cake tins suitable as con-,72
NA,tainers for sending cakes abroad is prohibited.,72
NA,They require a considerable quantity of t i n -,72
NA,plate that cannot be made available for this,72
NA,"purpose. Manufacturers of domestic tinware,",72
NA,"who are severely rationed in their supplies,",72
NA,"do manufacture, however, a re-usable cake t i n",72
NA,as a piece of kitchen equipment. This is an,72
NA,entirely different model and a l i d is neither,72
NA,"practicable, necessary or desirable. STo doubt",72
NA,this is the type of t i n to which the question,72
NA,referred.,72
NA,CANCER: CANTASSIUM TABLETS.,72
NA,NA,72
NA,the honorable member for Wilmot ( Mr.,72
NA,Duthie) asked a question concerning an,72
NA,"importation at Launceston, Tasmania, of",72
NA,cantassium tablets. The Minister for,72
NA,Trade and Customs has supplied the,72
NA,following information:-,72
NA,Tlie Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regu-,72
NA,lations provide that the importation of,72
NA,"medicinal preparations, known as "" Cantas-",72
NA,"sium "", whether described by that name or",72
NA,any other name shall be prohibited except w i t h,72
NA,the consent of the Minister for Trade and,72
NA,Customs.,72
NA,The prohibition was enacted many years ago,72
NA,the advice of the Director-General of,72
NA,Health wit h the object of preventing the ex-,72
NA,of the Australian public with pre-,72
NA,which are considered of no use for,72
NA,the purpose intended. I n the administration,72
NA,"of the prohibition, however, authority was",72
NA,given to permit importation of these goods i n,72
NA,cases where the Collector of Customs is satis-,72
NA,lied that the cantassium is imported by or for,72
NA,"a person who is actually suffering from cancer,",72
NA,that i t is not intended for sale and also that,72
NA,the quantity imported is not more than would,72
NA,be necessary for Buch patient.,72
NA,The parcel o'f cantassium tablets referred to,72
NA,by tlie honorable member arrived in Launces-,72
NA,"ton on 13th September, 1947. On the next",72
NA,day the importer's agent stressed the urgency,72
NA,"i n of the matter and, on being informed of the",72
NA,conditions under which the goods would he,72
NA,delivered undertook to obtain a certificate,72
NA,from the patient's doctor. The agent w.as re-,72
NA,peatedly reminded by the Customs officer deal-,72
NA,ing with the transaction to obtain the doctor's,72
NA,certificate which would have provided,72
NA,authority to release the goods but the certi-,72
NA,ficate was not produced. I n the absence of,72
NA,such necessary evidence of the intended dis-,72
NA,posal of the goods and as the importation,72
NA,"was in the name of a wholesale chemist,",72
NA,delivery was withheld. I t is understood that,72
NA,it was not until the 19th September that the,72
NA,relatives of the patient were requested by the,72
NA,importer to furnish a doctor's certificate but,72
NA,by that date the patient had died. As there,72
NA,should be very little difficulty i n obtaining,72
NA,proof that a person is actually suffering from,72
NA,"cancer, i t is considered that no alteration from",72
NA,the existing procedure regarding the importa-,72
NA,tion of cantassium is necessary or warranted.,72
NA,I can assure the honorable member that,72
NA,tlie Commonwealth Government would not pro-,72
NA,hibit the importation of any drugs recognized,72
NA,by competent authorities to be beneficial in the,72
NA,treatment of cancer.,72

Mr LEMMON , T h e answers to the,73
NA,honorable member's questions are as,73
NA,follows:-,73
NA,1. No.,73
NA,2. See answer to question 1.,73
NA,3 to 13. A number of these questions relate,73
NA,to matters outside the sphere of tlie Common-,73
NA,wealth's interests inasmuch as the Common-,73
NA,wealth and State Housing Agreement did not,73
NA,"become operative until 3rd December, 1943.",73
NA,Any activities of the Victorian Housing Com-,73
NA,mission prior to that date and their continuing,73
NA,effects ore entirely tlie responsibility of the,73
NA,"Victorian Government, and consequently any",73
NA,questions affecting that period should be,73

NA,Inquiries are being made regarding the remain-,73

Mr HOLLOWAY ,Th e Minister for,73

NA,Liquid Fuel Control Boards in all States that,73
NA,long distance travel by motor vehicle should,73
NA,bo eliminated i n respect of both business and,73
NA,"particularly pleasure journeys, unless there",73
NA,are very urgent reasons for justifying such,73
NA,travel such as the owner of the vehicle being,73
NA,on permanent transfer from one State to,73
NA,another and unable to arrange for the transport,73
NA,of his vehicle by either boat or rail.,73
NA,"Since these instructions were issued, infor-",73

NA,Mrs BLACKBURN asked the Minister,74
NA,representing the Minister for Supply and,74
NA,"Shipping, upon notice-",74
NA,1. Is i t a fact that representatives of the,74
NA,Mount Margaret Aborigines Mission in Western,74
NA,'Australia requiring certain goods from the,74
NA,Disposals Commission were informed that only,74
NA,"20 per cent, discount would be allowed?",74
NA,"2. I f so, can a more generous discount even",74
NA,"to SO or 75 per cent, be allowed in view of the",74
NA,"fact that about 300 aborigines would benefit,",74
NA,and the mission would be able to obtain a,74
NA,greater quantity of urgently needed material,74
NA,with its very limited resources?,74
NA,"3. Is i t a fact that, in two cases when",74
NA,application was made for certain lines and,74
NA,"the 20 per cent, discount concession was quoted",74
NA,"by the mission representatives, well over 20 per",74
NA,"cent, was added to the purchase price above",74
NA,the price quoted when the samples were in-,74
NA,"spected, and that the mission had to pay",74
NA,accordingly?,74
NA,"4. Will he allow a 10 per cent, deposit on",74
NA,the goods bought and arrange for the balance,74
NA,to be paid in twelve months?,74
NA,5. Can arrangements be made for free,74
NA,railway freight for all goods for aboriginal,74
NA,use consigned over Commonwealth Railways?,74
NA,6. I f i t be possible to take such action for the,74
NA,"benefit of this group of aborigines, can similar",74
NA,concessions be granted in regard to disposals,74
NA,for the benefit of other aboriginal groups?,74
Mr HOLLOWAY ,Th e answers to the,74
NA,honorable member's questions are as,74
NA,follows:-,74
NA,"1. An allowance of 20 per cent, discount",74
NA,"was granted to the mission. I t is emphasized,",74
NA,"however, that this discount was off wholesale",74
NA,"rates or cost, whichever was the lower.",74
NA,2. Tbe Commonwealth Disposals Commission,74
NA,is not a retail organization but gives special,74
NA,consideration to the needs of welfare organiza-,74
NA,tions. The commission has no authority to,74
NA,dispose of surplus government property other,74
NA,that at fair market prices. Hundreds of,74
NA,requests from charitable institutions and,74
NA,other deserving bodies for concessional treat-,74
NA,ment are received and any relaxation of pro-,74
NA,cedure would create a precedent difficult to,74
NA,resist in other directions. Under special Trea-,74
NA,"sury authority, certain approved charitable",74
NA,organizations are provided through the Com-,74
NA,monwealth Salvage Controller with used cloth-,74
NA,"ing and blankets' without payment, and the",74

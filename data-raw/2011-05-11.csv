NA,Second Reading,19
Mr BOWEN ,MCMahon-Minister for,19
NA,Immigration and Citizenship) (09:01): I,19
NA,move:,19
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,19
NA,The purpose of this bill is to ensure that a,19
NA,visa applicant or holder will fail the character,19
NA,test should they be convicted of any offence,19
NA,committed while they are in immigration,19
NA,detention; and to increase the maximum,19
NA,"penalty for the manufacture, possession, use",19
NA,or distribution of weapons by immigration,19
NA,detainees from three to five years,19
NA,imprisonment. These amendments are,19
NA,proposed in part to address issues arising,19
NA,from the recent criminal damage and riots at,19
NA,the Christmas Island detention centre in,19
NA,March and the Villawood Immigration,19
NA,Detention Centre in April 2011. Major,19
NA,damage was caused to the facilities as a,19
NA,result of these disturbances and there was,19
NA,significant risk of harm to other detainees,19
NA,and to staff at the facilities as well as more,19
NA,broadly to public order and safety.,19
NA,BILLS The bill is also intended to strengthen the,19
NA,powers under the Migration Act to provide a,19
NA,more significant disincentive for this sort of,19
NA,destructive behaviour now and in the future.,19
NA,The new provisions will apply to all people,19
NA,who are or have been in immigration,19
NA,"detention: onshore and offshore arrivals,",19
NA,"asylum seekers, or otherwise.",19
NA,"Under these new provisions, a person who",19
NA,has been convicted of a criminal offence,19
NA,while in immigration detention could be,19
NA,refused a visa or have a visa cancelled. In,19
NA,keeping with Australia's international,19
NA,"protection obligations, in such cases we will",19
NA,not return people to a place where they have,19
NA,a well-founded fear of persecution. Where it,19
NA,is not appropriate to remove people from,19
NA,"Australia because they are owed protection,",19
NA,consideration could be given to the grant of a,19
NA,temporary visa to place them in the,19
NA,community until their removal from,19
NA,Australia is appropriate.,19
NA,The public announcement on 26 April,19
NA,2011 of this legislative change put all,19
NA,detainees on notice that the Australian,19
NA,government takes criminal behaviour by,19
NA,people in immigration detention very,19
NA,seriously and will take appropriate measures,19
NA,to deal with it.,19
NA,It is essential that anyone convicted of an,19
NA,offence in relation to the recent events at,19
NA,Australian immigration detention centres is,19
NA,covered by these new provisions and has the,19
NA,amended character test applied to them.,19
NA,The Australian community expects there,19
NA,to be consequences for unlawful behaviour.,19
NA,Commencing these amendments to the,19
NA,character test provisions on 26 April 2011,19
NA,ensures this bill delivers those consequences,20
NA,and the government's objectives are met.,20
NA,These changes will apply for the purposes of,20
NA,"making a decision on or after 26 April 2011,",20
NA,whether the conviction or offence concerned,20
NA,"occurred before, on or after that date.",20
NA,The Australian community also expects,20
NA,noncitizens who seek to remain in Australia,20
NA,to be of good character. To meet this,20
NA,"expectation, the government must not only",20
NA,have the ability to act decisively and,20
NA,"effectively, wherever necessary, to deal with",20
NA,criminal behaviour by immigration,20
NA,"detainees, but also have the legislative basis",20
NA,"to effect a refusal to grant a visa, or a",20
NA,"cancellation of a visa, for those noncitizens",20
NA,who are not of good character. The,20
NA,government must be able to remove those,20
NA,noncitizens who have convictions for crimes,20
NA,committed in immigration detention in,20
NA,Australia where possible and consistent with,20
NA,our international obligations.,20
NA,"Among other things, section 501 of the",20
NA,Migration Act currently deals with matters,20
NA,that constitute serious criminal offences,20
NA,where a person can fail the character test.,20
NA,Noncitizens will fail the character test where,20
NA,they have been sentenced to a term of,20
NA,"imprisonment of 12 months or more, or",20
NA,where the length of several sentences,20
NA,aggregates to two years or more. If a person,20
NA,"fails the character test, this can be used",20
NA,basis for the refusal of a visa application or,20
NA,the cancellation of a visa that is held by a,20
NA,person. The proposed measures will amend,20
NA,the character test in section 501 of the,20
NA,Migration Act so that a person will fail the,20
NA,character test if the person is convicted of,20
NA,any offence committed while they are in,20
NA,"immigration detention, regardless of the",20
NA,sentence imposed. The intended amendment,20
NA,will not limit the application of the existing,20
NA,provisions relating to the character test.,20
NA,bill therefore seeks to establish an additional,20
NA,benchmark for criminal behaviour that will,20
NA,automatically lead to a visa applicant or,20
NA,holder failing the character test if they are,20
NA,convicted of an offence committed while,20
NA,they are in immigration detention.,20
NA,"Similarly, section 500A of the Migration",20
NA,Act provides that the minister may refuse the,20
NA,grant of a temporary safe haven visa or may,20
NA,cancel a temporary safe haven visa if a,20
NA,person has been sentenced to imprisonment,20
NA,of 12 months or more. Without limiting the,20
NA,application of the existing character,20
NA,provisions relating to section 500A of the,20
NA,"Migration Act, the proposed measures will",20
NA,amend section 500A of the act so that the,20
NA,minister may also refuse to grant a safe,20
NA,"haven visa, or may cancel a safe haven visa",20
NA,if the person is convicted of any offence,20
NA,committed while they are in immigration,20
NA,detention.,20
NA,For both the section 501 and section 500A,20
NA,"amendments it is intended, if a person",20
NA,"escapes from immigration detention, that any",20
NA,conviction for the offence of escaping or for,20
NA,an offence committed during or following,20
NA,their escape-up to the time of their being,20
NA,returned to immigration detention-be,20
NA,included.,20
NA,The amendments to sections 501 and,20
NA,500A have been drafted to ensure that they,20
NA,as a apply only to persons who have been,20
NA,convicted of an offence by a court. The,20
NA,amendments made to sections 501 and 500A,20
NA,will not apply to a person who is charged,20
NA,before a court with an offence or offences,20
NA,and the court is satisfied in respect of that,20
NA,"charge, or more than one of those charges,",20
NA,"that the charge is proved, but has discharged",20
NA,the person without a conviction on that,20
NA,"charge, or any of those charges. That is, there",20
NA,must be at least one conviction for the,20
NA,This amendments to sections 501 and 500A to,20
NA,apply. Currently section 197B of the,21
NA,Migration Act provides that an immigration,21
NA,detainee is guilty of an offence if he or she,21
NA,"manufactures, possesses, uses or distributes a",21
NA,weapon. A weapon includes a thing made or,21
NA,adapted for use for inflicting bodily injury;,21
NA,or a thing where the detainee who has the,21
NA,"thing intends or threatens to use the thing, or",21
NA,"intends that the thing be used, to inflict",21
NA,bodily injury. The current maximum penalty,21
NA,is imprisonment for three years. The,21
NA,proposed amendment to section 197B of the,21
NA,Migration Act will increase the maximum,21
NA,penalty to five years imprisonment. The,21
NA,"manufacture, possession, use and distribution",21
NA,of a weapon by a detainee puts at risk the,21
NA,personal safety of others in the immigration,21
NA,"detention environment, including other",21
NA,"detainees, Commonwealth officers,",21
NA,contracted detention services staff and,21
NA,visitors. The Australian community expects,21
NA,that there be robust sanctions to deal with,21
NA,people in immigration detention who,21
NA,threaten or inflict harm on other people and,21
NA,the intended increase in the maximum,21
NA,penalty for this offence reflects the,21
NA,seriousness with which the community views,21
NA,this offence.,21
NA,Conclusion,21
NA,"In summary, people in immigration",21
NA,detention who might contemplate criminal,21
NA,"behaviour, including the manufacture,",21
NA,"possession or use of weapons, need to clearly",21
NA,understand the seriousness of such behaviour,21
NA,and legal consequences that could follow,21
NA,from that behaviour in terms of criminal,21
NA,convictions and visa outcomes. These,21
NA,changes will: strengthen the character test in,21
NA,section 501 of the Migration Act; strengthen,21
NA,the power to refuse or cancel a temporary,21
NA,safe haven visa in section 500A of the,21
NA,Migration Act; and provide further,21
NA,disincentive in relation to the manufacture,21
NA,and possession of weapons by detainees by,21
NA,increasing the maximum penalty in section,21
NA,197B of the Migration Act. These measures,21
NA,are intended to send a strong and clear,21
NA,message that the kind of unacceptable,21
NA,behaviour recently seen at immigration,21
NA,detention centres will not be tolerated by the,21
NA,government.,21

Ms COLLINS ,Franklin-Parliamentary,22
NA,Secretary for Community Services) (09:09):,22
NA,I move:,22
NA,That the amendments be agreed to.,22
NA,These amendments provide for portability of,22
NA,the disability support pension to be extended,22
NA,in certain circumstances in which a family,22
NA,member of a DSP recipient is seconded,22
NA,overseas for employment purposes. These,22
NA,amendments reflect the findings of the,22
NA,"Senate committee inquiry on the Families,",22
NA,"Housing, Community Services",22
NA,Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation,22
NA,Amendment (Budget and Other Measures),22
NA,Bill 2010. The government has been,22
NA,responsive. We recognise that some family,22
NA,members of disability support pensioners,22
NA,may be required to spend extended periods,22
NA,of time overseas as a result of their,22
NA,"employment-for example, employees of the",22
NA,Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.,22
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies) (09:10): I,22
NA,indicate that the coalition support these,22
NA,"amendments. They are sensible, they are",22
NA,"practical and they are common sense, and we",22
NA,will support this legislation.,22

NA,Report from Committee,22
Ms RISHWORTH ,Kingston) (09:11):,22
NA,On behalf of the Standing Committee on,22
NA,Education and Employment I present the,22
NA,committee's report entitled Advisory report,22
NA,on the Social Security Legislation,22
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,22
NA,"not 2011, incorporating a dissenting report from",22
NA,"the member for Melbourne, together with the",22
NA,minutes of proceedings.,22
NA,Ordered that the report be made a,22
NA,parliamentary paper.,22
Ms RISHWORTH, by leave-The bill,22
NA,was referred by the House Selection,22
NA,Committee to the House Standing,22
NA,Committee on Education and Employment,22
NA,on 24 March 2011 for inquiry and report.,22
NA,This is the second bill referred to the,22
NA,education and employment committee under,22
NA,the new arrangements that provide for the,22
NA,Selection Committee to refer a bill to a,22
NA,committee for an advisory report.,22
NA,The inquiry received 16 submissions and,22
NA,"and took evidence from government departments,",22
NA,"employment and social security peak bodies,",22
NA,employment service providers and other,23
NA,stakeholders in two public hearings that were,23
NA,held in Melbourne and Canberra. We are,23
NA,especially grateful to the,23
NA,organisations and departments,23
NA,participated in the inquiry.,23
NA,The committee was struck by the passion,23
NA,"for social welfare, commitment to",23
NA,employment participation and breadth of,23
NA,knowledge expressed in many submissions,23
NA,and by numerous witnesses. Although the,23
NA,committee recognises that broader issues,23
NA,were raised in relation to the social,23
NA,"and welfare systems as a whole, the",23
NA,"committee's focus must, of course, remain on",23
NA,the measures proposed by this bill. This bill,23
NA,seeks to tighten the compliance regime,23
NA,currently applicable to job seekers receiving,23
NA,participation payments by introducing,23
NA,payment suspensions for job seekers who fail,23
NA,to attend appointments with their,23
NA,employment service providers until they,23
NA,agree to reschedule that appointment.,23
NA,There is no doubt about the crucial role,23
NA,that sustained and meaningful employment,23
NA,participation plays in the lives of all,23
NA,Australians. The minister echoed the words,23
NA,of our Prime Minister when she indicated,23
NA,that the benefits of employment stretch far,23
NA,beyond the receipt of a pay packet.,23
NA,Employment participation brings with it a,23
NA,suite of benefits including not only economic,23
NA,"security but also dignity, purpose and",23
NA,direction. A central element of fostering,23
NA,employment participation is encouraging job,23
NA,seekers to interact and engage with their,23
NA,employment service providers. A lot of,23
NA,people have spoken about this as a punitive,23
NA,"action, but the government and the",23
NA,committee saw it as a way to engage job,23
NA,seekers and to get them to talk with their,23
NA,"employment services, which is critical and",23
NA,important. The committee believes that this,23
NA,bill is a step in the right direction in this,23
NA,regard. I would like to respond to some of,23
NA,"the assertions in the dissenting report, in",23
NA,particular that there was not support for this,23
NA,"measure. In response to this claim, I draw the",23
NA,"people, attention of the House to, for example, the",23
NA,"who evidence from Dr Prins Ralston, Executive",23
NA,Leader of Employment Solutions at Mission,23
NA,"Australia, who said that these measures will:",23
NA,… assist employment providers by encouraging,23
NA,job seekers to properly engage with the system.,23
NA,That is the core of what we believe-that these,23
NA,amendments will be a tool that will help us to,23
NA,better engage job seekers.,23
NA,"security Ms Sinclair, CEO of the National",23
NA,"Employment Services Association, said:",23
NA,The amendments outlined in the current bill are,23
NA,considered welcome improvements to the job,23
NA,seeker compliance framework and we believe,23
NA,should put a greater emphasis on engagement and,23
NA,participation.,23
NA,While recognising that there were mixed,23
NA,"views expressed in the report of the CPSU,",23
NA,the union that represents the front-line,23
NA,"workers, its submission said:",23
NA,The majority of CPSU members felt that the,23
NA,proposed changes would likely increase,23
NA,compliance by job seekers as payments would not,23
NA,be made until job seekers attended appointments.,23
NA,A majority of members also said that changes to,23
NA,notification for reconnection requirements would,23
NA,improve job seeker compliance.,23
NA,We recognise that some issues with the bill,23
NA,"were brought up, especially in the",23
NA,"administration of the system, and the",23
NA,committee's report contains 10,23
NA,recommendations which we believe will,23
NA,enhance the communication and equitable,23
NA,administration of the measures proposed in,23
NA,the bill.,23
NA,A strong message to the committee,23
NA,received from peak bodies and other,23
NA,stakeholders was that the social security,23
NA,system is complex and often confusing.,23
NA,"Therefore, a key recommendation in our",23
NA,report centres on the production of plain,23
NA,English explanations of the changes,23
NA,proposed in the bill and the impact that they,24
NA,will have. The purpose of this,24
NA,recommendation is to combat and minimise,24
NA,complexity in order to enable effective,24
NA,communication of the changes proposed in,24
NA,the bill to all job seekers and to ensure that,24
NA,job seekers fully understand their obligations,24
NA,and are able to meaningfully engage with,24
NA,employment service providers. In a similar,24
NA,"vein, the committee has recommended that",24
NA,the word 'special' be removed from the,24
NA,reasonable excuses provision proposed by,24
NA,"the bill, again in order to simplify and clarify",24
NA,the measures proposed by the bill and ensure,24
NA,that they are implemented as intended,24
NA,without an unnecessary level of complexity.,24
NA,The committee has also recommended the,24
NA,development of consistent guidance and,24
NA,training materials for those who will be,24
NA,involved in the administration of the,24
NA,proposed compliance regime and the,24
NA,provision of comprehensive training to,24
NA,Centrelink and employment service provider,24
NA,staff. These measures will ensure the,24
NA,consistent and equitable application and,24
NA,administration of the proposed compliance,24
NA,"regime across the board. Furthermore, the",24
NA,committee has recommended the collection,24
NA,of data in relation to why job seekers without,24
NA,a reasonable excuse miss appointments and a,24
NA,review of the impact of the measures,24
NA,proposed by this bill.,24
NA,recommendations are targeted at filling a,24
NA,perceived gap in the research conducted in,24
NA,the area of job seeker compliance and,24
NA,ensuring that a concerted effort is made to,24
NA,continue to monitor and evaluate the,24
NA,effectiveness of the proposed compliance,24
NA,regime.,24
NA,"In relation to vulnerable job seekers, about",24
NA,whom many witnesses and submissions,24
NA,"expressed concern, the committee has",24
NA,recommended that employment service,24
NA,providers utilise all re-engagement methods,24
NA,"available to them, not only compliance",24
NA,"action, in order to re-engage these job",24
NA,seekers. The committee recognises that,24
NA,vulnerable job seekers do have special needs,24
NA,that must be addressed properly. The,24
NA,committee has also recommended that,24
NA,additional training and resources be provided,24
NA,to Centrelink staff in order to raise awareness,24
NA,of vulnerable job seekers and ensure that,24
NA,their vulnerabilities are being identified and,24
NA,managed in a manner that is conducive to,24
NA,assisting these job seekers to find and,24
NA,maintain employment.,24
NA,The committee also acknowledges the,24
NA,concerns that were raised about the capacity,24
NA,of Centrelink staff to implement the,24
NA,"proposed measures, given their current",24
NA,workload. I and the committee were pleased,24
NA,that the Department of Human Services has,24
NA,indicated that it will monitor this impact in,24
NA,consultation with Centrelink staff and,24
NA,rearrange working arrangements,24
NA,accordingly. The committee agrees that this,24
NA,monitoring should occur to ensure that no,24
NA,undue stress or unreasonable workloads are,24
NA,put on front-line staff.,24
NA,"In closing, I would like to thank all the",24
NA,committee members who worked on this.,24
NA,There was a lot of constructive discussion,24
NA,and engagement on this. I would also like to,24
NA,These thank the committee secretariat for their,24
NA,"support-in particular, Sara Edson and",24
NA,Larisa Michalko for their hard work on this,24
NA,inquiry. I commend the report to the House.,24
Mr BANDT ,Melbourne) (09:20): by,24
NA,leave-We hear a lot in this place and,24
NA,"elsewhere about evidence based policy, and",24
NA,indeed I think it was the member for Fraser,24
NA,who moved a motion to that effect which,24
NA,"was passed in this House. But, if there were",24
NA,ever any proof needed that evidence based,24
NA,policy gives way to political imperatives,24
NA,"every time, it was this inquiry process and",25
NA,"this bill. As we have heard, the effect and the",25
NA,purpose of the bill is to impose sanctions on,25
NA,job seekers up to and including losing part of,25
NA,their pay that they will never get back.,25
NA,"During the course of the inquiry, almost",25
NA,"everyone who fronted up to the inquiry,",25
NA,either in the form of a written submission or,25
NA,"to give us evidence in person, said that this",25
NA,was the wrong approach.,25
NA,Last year there was an independent review,25
NA,commissioned by this government into the,25
NA,compliance framework for the social security,25
NA,system. That review was chaired by,25
NA,Professor Julian Disney. There were a,25
NA,number of recommendations. Prior to the,25
NA,"introduction of this bill, the government had",25
NA,"not responded to the recommendations, but it",25
NA,is basing its bill on the review and says the,25
NA,review by Professor Disney gave support to,25
NA,the move to impose financial sanctions on,25
NA,job seekers. The only problem with that is,25
NA,that Professor Disney fronted up to the,25
NA,inquiry and gave evidence that he thought,25
NA,"that, at best, this bill was premature and was",25
NA,in effect ill judged. He said that he only,25
NA,included a note about that in his independent,25
NA,report because it was raised by other parties,25
NA,during the course of the federal election. He,25
NA,did not think it was a good idea and it was,25
NA,not one that he would have generated,25
NA,himself. It was an idea he felt obliged to,25
NA,raise because it was circulating in public,25
NA,debate. In his recommendation that refers to,25
NA,"this proposal, he said that at the very least",25
NA,should give all the other measures that he has,25
NA,recommended a year to bed down before we,25
NA,embark on something as punitive as,25
NA,suspending people's payments he reasons for,25
NA,that are clear. They were relayed to the,25
NA,committee by job agency after job agency,25
NA,who came before the committee to say that,25
NA,people find the social security system,25
NA,bewildering and that you cannot proceed on,25
NA,an assumption that the reason people miss,25
NA,appointments is that they are somehow,25
NA,"seeking to work the system. In fact, evidence",25
NA,was given to the inquiry that the people who,25
NA,want to work the system are precisely the,25
NA,ones who will turn up to every meeting,25
NA,because they know what is required. The,25
NA,people who are going to be hit by this bill are,25
NA,"not the ones who are rorting the system but,",25
NA,"according to the evidence, the ones who are",25
NA,confused by the system and who potentially,25
NA,find it difficult. That is why the No. 1,25
NA,recommendation of the independent review,25
NA,was that there be a plain language reworking,25
NA,of all materials associated with job seeker,25
NA,"compliance, because until we are sure that",25
NA,job seekers understand their obligations we,25
NA,cannot punish them for failing to meet them.,25
NA,The second implicit rationale in the bill is,25
NA,that job seekers are somehow not turning up,25
NA,for so-called illegitimate reasons. The,25
NA,"problem with that, if we are serious about",25
NA,"evidence based policy, is that you would",25
NA,imagine that someone would have been able,25
NA,to come to the inquiry and tell us why it is,25
NA,that people are missing appointments. No-,25
NA,one could do that. The department could not,25
NA,do that and none of the very small number of,25
NA,people who supported the submission could,25
NA,do that. What we do know from the figures is,25
NA,that 20 per cent of people who miss,25
NA,appointments are Indigenous Australians and,25
NA,that 47 per cent of the people who miss,25
NA,appointments are young people. No-one,25
NA,could explain why that was and no-one could,25
NA,we explain why it was justified that there should,25
NA,be a disproportionate impact on those people,25
NA,of these harsh penalties.,25
NA,What almost everyone who appeared,25
NA,before the inquiry agreed with was that we,25
NA,"should go back to basics. First of all, let us",25
NA,find out why people are missing these,25
NA,appointments-find out whether it is because,25
NA,"they do not have good transport options, find",25
NA,out whether it is because they do not,25
NA,"understand the system, find out whether they",25
NA,knew this was necessary in order for,26
NA,continued payment-and then develop,26
NA,"programs that are tailored to that. In fact,",26
NA,is going on. The inquiry heard that the,26
NA,Centrelink working group is looking at that,26
NA,at the moment; its work is not yet complete.,26
NA,That is why the Greens have put in a,26
NA,dissenting report. We cannot support the,26
NA,passage of this bill. We propose that time be,26
NA,given to allow the recommendations of the,26
NA,"independent inquiry to go ahead, to allow the",26
NA,Centrelink working group to do its job of,26
NA,gathering a proper evidence base about why,26
NA,so many young people and so many,26
NA,Indigenous Australians are,26
NA,"appointments, and to not take the approach",26
NA,that is more stick than carrot and potentially,26
NA,put some of our most disadvantaged job,26
NA,"seekers, who are without an income, even",26
NA,further into dire straits.,26
NA,COMMITTEES,26
NA,Treaties Committee,26
NA,Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills),26
NA,(09:25): On behalf of the Joint Standing,26
NA,"Committee on Treaties, I present the",26
NA,committee's report entitled Report 116:,26
NA,Treaties tabled on 24 and 25 November,26
NA,"2010, 9 February and 1 March 2011 and",26
NA,Treaties referred on 16 November 2010,26
NA,"(Part 3), incorporating a dissenting report.",26
NA,Ordered that the report be made a,26
NA,parliamentary paper.,26
NA,Mr KELVIN THOMSON: by leave-,26
NA,The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties,26
NA,Report 116 contains the committee's views,26
NA,on 15 treaties ranging from amendments to,26
NA,CITES and the Australian-New Zealand,26
NA,Closer Economic Relations Trade,26
NA,Agreement to ILO conventions on the,26
NA,"working conditions of sailors, the treatment",26
NA,of asbestos and occupational health and,26
NA,safety. I am happy to advise that this report,26
NA,deals with the last of the treaties for which,26
NA,that consideration was delayed by the 2010,26
NA,federal election. It is a credit to the,26
NA,committee's members that it has been able to,26
NA,consider and report on no less than 55,26
NA,treaties since the election and has met the,26
NA,agreed reporting deadline for each one of,26
NA,"them. In addition, for many of the treaties the",26
NA,committee not only issued invitations to,26
NA,"participate to its regular stakeholders,",26
NA,including government agencies and state and,26
NA,"territory governments, but was able to take",26
NA,evidence from a range of other interested,26
NA,"missing parties. For example, the committee's",26
NA,consideration of amendments to the,26
NA,Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic,26
NA,Relations Trade Agreement involved a visit,26
NA,"to suiting manufacturers the Stafford Group,",26
NA,whose plant is in North Melbourne. The,26
NA,Stafford Group retails it suits under the,26
NA,"brands Anthony Squires, Giotto and 1096.",26
NA,Anthony Squires is the only retailer of,26
NA,Report high-quality suits still manufacturing in,26
NA,Australia. The Stafford Group is concerned,26
NA,that this arrangement will be placed at risk,26
NA,by the amendments proposed to the,26
NA,Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic,26
NA,Relations Trade Agreement. The committee,26
NA,has been assured by the government that it is,26
NA,aware of the Stafford Group's tenuous,26
NA,position and that it is working to ameliorate,26
NA,the impact of the treaty amendments on that,26
NA,organisation.,26
NA,I also draw the parliament's attention to,26
NA,the participation of the seafaring community,26
NA,in the inquiry into the ILO Maritime Labour,26
NA,Convention. This convention is intended to,26
NA,provide a set of basic working conditions for,26
NA,seafarers employed in international,26
NA,commercial shipping. The convention,26
NA,"requires, amongst other things, that seafarers",26
NA,"be properly trained, have written legally",26
NA,"enforceable pay and conditions, have",27
NA,appropriate living conditions and have access,27
NA,"to medical care. Crucially, the convention",27
NA,will ensure that the conditions extend to,27
NA,ships registered in countries that are not,27
NA,party to the convention. International,27
NA,shipping that does not meet these conditions,27
NA,will face severe penalties when it enters the,27
NA,ports of convention signatories. The,27
NA,penalties will remove any shipping cost,27
NA,advantages attributable to poor working and,27
NA,living conditions for seafarers. Amongst,27
NA,those who have already ratified the,27
NA,convention are the flag of convenience states,27
NA,"of Liberia, Panama and the Bahamas. The",27
NA,convention has been well received by the,27
NA,seafaring community in Australia. Amongst,27
NA,those expressing support for Australia's,27
NA,ratification of the convention are peak,27
NA,"employer organisations, Shipping Australia",27
NA,Ltd and the Australian Ship Owners,27
NA,"Association; seafarers representatives, the",27
NA,Australian Institute of Marine and Power,27
NA,Engineers and the Maritime Union of,27
NA,Australia; and representatives of charities,27
NA,"supporting seafarers, the Australian Council",27
NA,of the Mission to Seafarers and the Sydney,27
NA,Seafarers Centre. All of these organisations,27
NA,had useful suggestions about how the,27
NA,"convention is implemented, and the",27
NA,committee commends their suggestions to,27
NA,the government for consideration.,27
NA,"It is remarkable, therefore, given",27
NA,degree of across-the-board support for this,27
NA,"convention, that coalition members and",27
NA,senators could not see their way clear to,27
NA,support it and have issued a dissenting,27
NA,report. It shows how deeply ideological they,27
NA,still are concerning industrial relations,27
NA,"questions, how hostile they are to the work",27
NA,"of the ILO, the International Labour",27
NA,"Organisation. And it shows that, when you",27
NA,"scratch below the surface, they have learnt",27
NA,nothing from the 2007 Work Choices,27
NA,debacle which led to their election defeat.,27
NA,"Finally, report No. 116 expresses the",27
NA,committee's frustration about treaties,27
NA,amended without ratification that come into,27
NA,force before they are scrutinised by the,27
NA,"committee or the public. For example, the",27
NA,treaty amending the International,27
NA,Convention for the Prevention of Pollution,27
NA,from Ships was tabled in parliament in,27
NA,"November 2010, after having come into",27
NA,force some five months earlier. This does not,27
NA,need to happen. Changes to treaties amended,27
NA,without ratification are provided to signatory,27
NA,countries for consideration up to 12 months,27
NA,before they come into effect. This period,27
NA,allows signatory countries that do not agree,27
NA,to the changes to either opt out of the,27
NA,changes or attempt to have the changes,27
NA,removed. In the case of the treaty amending,27
NA,the International Convention for the,27
NA,"Prevention of Pollution from Ships, the",27
NA,amendments were provided to Australia in,27
NA,mid-2009 and the period for objecting to the,27
NA,treaty ended in June 2010. There is enough,27
NA,time in this 12-month period for parliament,27
NA,and the public to make a material,27
NA,contribution to the outcome. So our report,27
NA,recommends that amendments to treaties of,27
NA,this sort be referred to the parliament for,27
NA,consideration at the time they are first,27
NA,provided to Australia so that the parliament,27
NA,can have a say before the changes come into,27
NA,force. I commend the report to the House.,27
NA,the high Public Accounts and Audit Committee,27
NA,Report,27
Mr OAKESHOTT ,Lyne) (09:32): On,27
NA,behalf of the Joint Committee of Public,27
NA,Accounts and Audit I present the,27
NA,committee's report entitled Report 422:,27
NA,Review of the 2009-10 Defence Materiel,27
NA,Organisation major projects report.,27
NA,Ordered that the report be made a,27
NA,parliamentary paper.,27
Mr OAKESHOTT, by leave-On 6,27
NA,December 2006 the Joint Committee of,27
NA,Public Accounts and Audit unanimously,28
NA,agreed to recommend that the Australian,28
NA,National Audit Office receive additional,28
NA,funding to produce an annual report on,28
NA,progress in major Defence projects. This,28
NA,"report would detail cost, schedule and",28
NA,capability information for a number of large,28
NA,acquisition projects. The government agreed,28
NA,with that recommendation and approved,28
NA,funding for the report in the May 2008,28
NA,budget. The intention was that the annual,28
NA,major projects report would provide a means,28
NA,"by which accessible, transparent and",28
NA,accurate information could be made,28
NA,available to the parliament and the,28
NA,Australian public about the state of Defence,28
NA,major acquisition projects.,28
NA,The 2009-10 Defence Materiel,28
NA,Organisation major projects report is the,28
NA,"third MPR to be produced, but only the",28
NA,second MPR to be reviewed and reported on,28
NA,"by the committee. Therefore, through this",28
NA,review the committee has incorporated,28
NA,ongoing issues that were raised as part of the,28
NA,review of the pilot MPR in 2007-08 but also,28
NA,provides discussion on the Auditor-General's,28
NA,major findings in relation to the 2008-09,28
NA,MPR in addition to the 2009-10 MPR.,28
NA,Major acquisition projects are complex,28
NA,and often diverse in nature. This creates,28
NA,challenges for the DMO in presenting,28
NA,consistent data across projects and for the,28
NA,"ANAO in reviewing this work. In particular,",28
NA,as qualified audit conclusions have been,28
NA,"received for the 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-",28
NA,"10 MPRs, due to the exclusion of price and",28
NA,expenditure information expressed in base,28
NA,"state dollars, the committee focused on",28
NA,evidence received in relation to this,28
NA,particular issue. Through,28
NA,recommendations the committee has,28
NA,requested that the DMO address the base,28
NA,state dollar issue associated with the,28
NA,"qualified audit opinions given, with a",28
NA,resolution of the matter expected for the,28
NA,2001-12 MPR.,28
NA,Other areas of importance highlighted,28
NA,during the review include the timing of the,28
NA,"preparation of the MPR guidelines,",28
NA,determining the exit criteria for MPR,28
NA,"projects, the impact of financial control",28
NA,"frameworks on the cost, schedule and",28
NA,"capability of projects, analysis of the Gate",28
NA,Review Assurance Board's process and,28
NA,inclusion of earnt value management systems,28
NA,data in the project data summary sheets for,28
NA,individual projects.,28
NA,The 2009-10 MPR builds on the level and,28
NA,presentation of information provided in the,28
NA,"previous MPRs, which in turn improves the",28
NA,readability and utility of the document. As,28
NA,each successive MPR is intended to further,28
NA,progress and improve both accountability,28
NA,and transparency with regard to the,28
NA,management of major defence capital,28
NA,"acquisition projects, it is important that the",28
NA,concerns highlighted through the assurance,28
NA,"audit process, and consequently the",28
NA,"committee's review, be dealt with and",28
NA,addressed by the DMO itself.,28
NA,On behalf of the committee I would like to,28
NA,congratulate the Auditor-General and the,28
NA,DMO on the cooperative manner in which,28
NA,they and their staff have worked to produce,28
NA,"the 2009-10 MPR. Ultimately, the scrutiny",28
NA,provided through the review of the MPR,28
NA,should increase transparency and,28
NA,accountability and therefore provide the,28
NA,Australian public with confidence that,28
NA,Defence procurement dollars are being spent,28
NA,wisely to provide Australian Defence Force,28
NA,personnel with the quality support they,28
NA,its deserve. I commend the report to the House.,28
NA,Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (09:36): by leave-,28
NA,As Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of,28
NA,"Public Accounts and Audit, I rise to speak in",28
NA,"support of report 422, Review of the 2009-10",29
NA,Defence Materiel Organisation Major,29
NA,"Projects Report. As the chair, the member",29
NA,"for Lyne, has already highlighted, this is",29
NA,the second major project report to be,29
NA,reviewed and reported on by the committee,29
NA,and the third major project report to be,29
NA,produced overall since the Joint Committee,29
NA,of Public Accounts and Audit unanimously,29
NA,agreed to recommend that the Australian,29
NA,National Audit Office receive additional,29
NA,funding to produce an annual report on,29
NA,progress in major defence projects back in,29
NA,December 2006.,29
NA,It is important to acknowledge the reason,29
NA,"such a report was created in the first place,",29
NA,which is to provide a means by which,29
NA,"accessible, transparent and accurate",29
NA,information could be made available to the,29
NA,"parliament and, importantly, the Australian",29
NA,public about the state of defence major,29
NA,acquisition projects. The government,29
NA,recognises the importance of transparency,29
NA,and accountability in relation to the major,29
NA,project acquisitions by the Defence Materiel,29
NA,Organisation and the important role that the,29
NA,major projects report plays in providing that,29
NA,transparency and accountability.,29
NA,"It is of note that, through its",29
NA,"recommendations, the committee has",29
NA,requested that the Defence Materiel,29
NA,Organisation address the base-date dollar,29
NA,issue associated with the qualified audit,29
NA,"opinions given, with the resolution of the",29
NA,matter expected for the 2011-12 major,29
NA,"project report, the reason being that the",29
NA,qualified audit conclusions have been,29
NA,received for each and every one of the major,29
NA,project reports that have been produced. It is,29
NA,important that we overcome this problem of,29
NA,having these qualified audit conclusions. As,29
NA,"the chair has indicated, quite a bit of",29
NA,evidence went to that point and there were,29
NA,questions from the committee members to,29
NA,ensure that we can overcome this problem in,29
NA,the future and provide more transparency.,29
NA,The work of the Defence Materiel,29
NA,only Organisation to improve accountability and,29
NA,transparency in regard to the management of,29
NA,major defence capital acquisition projects,29
NA,and the work that the Defence Materiel,29
NA,Organisation is doing to work with the,29
NA,Australian National Audit Office to ensure,29
NA,this transparency and accountability is,29
NA,"acknowledged. However, importantly, we",29
NA,must note that the concerns highlighted,29
NA,through the assurance audit process and,29
NA,consequently the committee's review must be,29
NA,dealt with and addressed by the DMO.,29
NA,I also take this opportunity to,29
NA,acknowledge and congratulate Mr Ian,29
NA,"MCPhee, the Auditor-General, and Dr",29
NA,"Stephen Gumley, the CEO of DMO, on the",29
NA,cooperative manner in which they and their,29
NA,staff have worked to produce the 2009-10,29
NA,major projects report. It is my pleasure to,29
NA,commend the report to the House.,29
Mr OAKESHOTT, I move:,29
NA,That the House take note of the report.,29
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. BC,29
NA,Scott): In accordance with standing order,29
NA,"39, the debate is adjourned. The resumption",29
NA,of the debate will be made an order of the,29
NA,day for the next sitting.,29
NA,Report and Reference to Main Committee,29

NA,Corporations Amendment (Improving,29
NA,Accountability on Director and,29
NA,Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011,29
NA,Second Reading,29
NA,Debate resumed on the motion:,29
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,29
Ms BRODTMANN ,Canberra) (09:41):,30
NA,The Corporations Amendment (Improving,30
NA,Accountability on Director and Executive,30
NA,Remuneration) Bill 2011 is a step forward in,30
NA,ensuring that shareholders and Australians,30
NA,generally have faith in the accountability of,30
NA,directors and senior executives of Australian,30
NA,"companies and, most importantly, in the",30
NA,fairness of their pay. It does this not by,30
NA,regulation but by an approach that respects,30
NA,the need for firms to operate freely in the,30
NA,"market, at the same time giving shareholders",30
NA,the power they need to make sure that senior,30
NA,executives truly earn their pay.,30
NA,This is far from the only area in which,30
NA,government shows a decisive preference for,30
NA,"market based solutions over regulation, a",30
NA,preference one would hope would be more,30
NA,widely shared and appreciated by those,30
NA,"opposite. I say 'appreciated' because, just",30
NA,listening to this debate in the last few days,30
NA,"and last night particularly, my colleagues in",30
NA,the Labor government were portrayed as,30
NA,crazy red raggers living in some socialist,30
NA,"nirvana: every morning we leap out of bed,",30
NA,"flick through our copy of the little red book,",30
NA,"read out our favourite passages, sing a few",30
NA,rounds of The Internationale and then march,30
NA,off to work under the fluttering banner of the,30
NA,Soviet flag.,30
Mr Husic, That is what I do!,30
Ms BRODTMANN, Is that what you,30
NA,do? Was that this morning? Okay! I remind,30
NA,those opposite of what the Labor,30
NA,government-not just this Labor government,30
NA,but also Labor governments in the past-has,30
NA,done in introducing market based solutions,30
NA,for this country. In the 1980s we opened up,30
NA,"the economy, we opened up markets, we",30
NA,opened up banks and we opened up the,30
NA,"country, particularly to the Asia-Pacific. We",30
NA,"cut protection. Most recently, since 2007 we",30
NA,have saved this economy from the global,30
NA,financial crisis. I hardly regard that as some,30
NA,"sort of mad, red-ragging socialist bunch of",30
NA,people crazily singing The Internationale,30
NA,every morning.,30
NA,The issue of remuneration has been at the,30
NA,forefront of the minds of shareholders and,30
NA,"the Australian community for some time, an",30
NA,issue more pressing following the corporate,30
NA,collapses associated with the global financial,30
NA,crisis. People around the world were rightly,30
NA,outraged that senior executives continued to,30
NA,receive large pay packages-so-called,30
NA,performance bonuses and golden,30
NA,parachutes-at a time when their companies,30
NA,"this were failing, leaving many average",30
NA,employees without jobs and their homes at,30
NA,risk. We in this country were spared the full,30
NA,extent of the effects of the global financial,30
NA,crisis thanks to the quick actions of the,30
NA,Labor government. But Australians remain,30
NA,highly concerned about the rates of executive,30
NA,pay. This concern is sharpened by the,30
NA,disparity between the pay packets of senior,30
NA,executives and those of average Australian,30
NA,working families. I am struck by the,30
NA,Productivity Commission's findings on this.,30
NA,The Productivity Commission reports that,30
NA,the top CEOs of Australian public companies,30
NA,receive pay some 110 times average,30
NA,Australian weekly earnings. This compares,30
NA,with the earnings of the CEOs of Australia's,30
NA,smallest companies of just four times,30
NA,average Australian weekly earnings. In some,30
NA,"cases, CEO remuneration grew by as much",30
NA,as 300 per cent in real terms between 1993,30
NA,and 2007.,30
NA,Australians do not have a problem with,30
NA,other hardworking individuals earning more,30
NA,pay than they do. But they do have a,30
NA,"problem with these remuneration packages,",30
NA,bonus schemes and golden parachutes being,30
NA,bestowed regardless of the actual,30
NA,"performance of the individual. Given this, it",30
NA,is easy to understand why these packages are,31
NA,so hard for people to accept. We should not,31
NA,be surprised at the level of anger and,31
NA,mistrust that exists over this issue. Such,31
NA,"mistrust is not healthy, as it undermines the",31
NA,basic strong sense of fairness that,31
NA,Australians have and the trust that is needed,31
NA,for a society based on the free market to,31
NA,function.,31
NA,There have been efforts in the past to,31
NA,ensure that management teams look after the,31
NA,"best interests of shareholders, principally by",31
NA,linking performance to share value. This,31
NA,worked up to a point. But research shows,31
NA,that this linkage has been distorted. It has,31
NA,emerged that there are a number of factors,31
NA,"that go into the calculation of remuneration,",31
NA,"some of which are reasonable, some of",31
NA,which are the result of what can only be,31
NA,described as gaming. As the Productivity,31
NA,"Commission mentioned, while local",31
NA,shareholder value plummeted in 2008 as the,31
NA,"result of the GFC, the imported crisis, with",31
NA,some countries and sectors being propped up,31
NA,"by taxpayers, executive pay seemed to",31
NA,"emerge unscathed, crystallising a view that",31
NA,executives were being rewarded for failure,31
NA,after having been rewarded for success.,31
NA,The argument that these packages are,31
NA,required to acquire and keep the best talent,31
NA,also not supported by available evidence.,31
NA,One journal article notes that there is a,31
NA,turnover rate for senior executives of,31
NA,between four per cent and six per cent. The,31
NA,article states that it is a matter of judgment,31
NA,whether a turnover rate of five per cent is,31
NA,sufficient to create market pressure to raise,31
NA,levels of compensation by itself. It is also,31
NA,questionable whether independent,31
NA,remuneration committees are by themselves,31
NA,capable of better linking performance with,31
NA,"reward, given some of the biases and",31
NA,conflicts of interest that may result. In,31
NA,"Jennifer Hill and Charles Yablon, who are",31
NA,"regular commentators on this issue, have",31
NA,noted that even carefully constructed,31
NA,remuneration packages will frequently,31
NA,provide corporate manager with incentives to,31
NA,use their strategic advantage within the,31
NA,company to prefer their own interests over,31
NA,those of the shareholders.,31
NA,This bill seeks to address these problems,31
NA,and allay the concerns of shareholders and,31
NA,Australians as a whole by implementing,31
NA,changes to the Corporations Act,31
NA,recommended by the Productivity,31
NA,Commission. It seeks to address the,31
NA,imbalance between shareholders and,31
NA,management and provide some much-needed,31
NA,help to ensure that boards are responsive to,31
NA,the concerns of shareholders. But rather than,31
NA,imposing a government limit on,31
NA,remuneration this bill seeks to make boards,31
NA,"more accountable for their decisions on pay,",31
NA,improve the manner in which conflicts are,31
NA,dealt with and increase transparency and,31
NA,accountability in executive remuneration,31
NA,matters.,31
NA,It achieves these things by introducing the,31
NA,so-called three-strikes test. This test creates a,31
NA,process by which directors will face a spill,31
NA,motion on their position if over two,31
NA,consecutive years a company's remuneration,31
NA,report has been rejected by 25 per cent or,31
NA,is more of the votes. Should this spill motion,31
NA,"be passed, directors will need to seek re-",31
NA,election at a spill meeting within 90 days of,31
NA,the AGM. This will make directors,31
NA,accountable for their decisions and,31
NA,responsive to their shareholders.,31
NA,This bill also seeks to bring greater,31
NA,transparency to the role of remuneration,31
NA,consultants. This measure reflects the,31
NA,concern expressed by some shareholders that,31
NA,remuneration consultants are placed in a,31
NA,potential conflict situation when they have to,31
NA,"provide their advice, in the first instance, to",31
NA,"fact, the very managers who are responsible for",31
NA,signing off on their services in the future.,31
NA,"Obviously, this has the potential to create a",32
NA,situation whereby the consultant may feel,32
NA,constrained in what advice they can provide.,32
NA,"To counter this potential conflict, this",32
NA,legislation will require that the reports of,32
NA,independent consultants go first to the non-,32
NA,executive directors or a remuneration,32
NA,committee rather than company executives.,32
NA,This bill also seeks to eliminate situations,32
NA,where key management personnel or closely,32
NA,related parties are voting on pay issues. The,32
NA,bill will prohibit such parties from voting on,32
NA,"non-binding remuneration votes, which",32
NA,otherwise may distort the results and,32
NA,diminish their effectiveness as a feedback,32
NA,mechanism.,32
NA,The government is also committed to,32
NA,strengthening the link between performance,32
NA,and remuneration. That is a really important,32
NA,point to make. This bill will prohibit,32
NA,directors and senior executives from hedging,32
NA,their incentive remuneration. It is currently,32
NA,possible for a director or senior executive to,32
NA,hedge their exposure to incentive,32
NA,"remuneration, thereby effectively bypassing",32
NA,the link between performance and pay. This,32
NA,is not consistent with the principles,32
NA,underlying a remuneration framework that,32
NA,seeks to ensure pay is fairly linked to,32
NA,achievement. I do not think that that is too,32
NA,much to ask.,32
NA,This bill is a comprehensive approach to,32
NA,the issues of remuneration of Australian,32
NA,boards and senior executives. It seeks to,32
NA,answer the questions and concerns of the,32
NA,community and shareholders over the issues,32
NA,"of excessive executive pay, particularly in",32
NA,the light of poor performance. It does this,32
NA,without placing restrictive or draconian,32
NA,regulation on companies or by interfering,32
NA,drastically in the marketplace. I want to,32
NA,"underscore that point, because from the way",32
NA,that the people opposite have been talking it,32
NA,seems that they view it as quite the contrary.,32
NA,It does not interfere in the marketplace. This,32
NA,bill enhances Australia's corporate,32
NA,"governance framework, particularly",32
NA,transparency. It provides shareholders with,32
NA,the power they need to effectively monitor,32
NA,their own companies to ensure that boards,32
NA,and senior executives are delivering on the,32
NA,organisational outcomes and are rewarded,32
NA,accordingly. It gives shareholders the power,32
NA,to say no to packages that reward failure or,32
NA,"poor performance, and it improves the",32
NA,governance of companies to ensure better,32
NA,reward for good performance and no reward,32
NA,"for failure. Most importantly, it benefits not",32
NA,only shareholders but the economy as a,32
NA,whole. The benefits of this legislation are,32
NA,"clear, and I commend it to the House.",32
Mr TEHAN ,Wannon) (09:52): I rise,32
NA,today to talk on the Corporations,32
NA,Amendment (Improving Accountability on,32
NA,Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill,32
NA,2011. The coalition will not oppose this bill,32
NA,but we will seek to make an important,32
NA,amendment to it. We will do that to make,32
NA,sure that we get the balance right in this bill.,32
NA,While we are broadly supportive of the,32
NA,objective to achieve better alignment,32
NA,between shareholders and boards on the,32
NA,"issue of executive remuneration, we are",32
NA,concerned about the potential for unintended,32
NA,consequences which can flow from excessive,32
NA,and overly prescriptive regulation in this,32
NA,"area-and, sadly, the Labor government",32
NA,have a strong history of excessive and overly,32
NA,prescriptive regulation. They continue to,32
NA,want to throttle the life out of business in,32
NA,"Australia, and that is why we have to make",32
NA,sure that we get the balance right in this bill.,32
NA,This bill implements recommendations of,32
NA,the Productivity Commission in its recent,32
NA,inquiry into executive remuneration in,32
NA,"Australia, which reported on 4 January 2010.",32
NA,Concern around the issue of executive,33
NA,remuneration led to the review by the,33
NA,Productivity Commission. The review,33
NA,commenced in 2009 and received 170,33
NA,"submissions, showing that this is an issue",33
NA,which the community and the business,33
NA,community take incredibly seriously. The,33
NA,final report was provided to the Australian,33
NA,government on 19 December 2009.,33
NA,An exposure draft elicited further,33
NA,comment and changes to the proposed,33
NA,legislation. The bill's main provisions,33
NA,include requiring a vote for directors to stand,33
NA,for re-election if they do not adequately,33
NA,address shareholder concerns,33
NA,remuneration issues over two consecutive,33
NA,"years, the so-called two-strikes rule;",33
NA,changing regulation with respect to the use,33
NA,of remuneration consultants; prohibiting,33
NA,directors and executives from voting their,33
NA,shares on remuneration resolutions;,33
NA,prohibiting the hedging of incentive,33
NA,remuneration; requiring shareholder approval,33
NA,for declarations of 'no vacancy' at an annual,33
NA,general meeting; requiring that any directed,33
NA,proxies are voted and voted as directed; and,33
NA,reducing the complexity of the remuneration,33
NA,report by confining disclosures in the report,33
NA,to the key management personnel.,33
NA,Change to voting arrangements must be,33
NA,careful not to distort the wishes of the,33
NA,majority of shareholders. The views of a,33
NA,minority should not too easily hold the,33
NA,majority hostage. When it comes to the level,33
NA,of support required to reject a remuneration,33
NA,"report, a process that can lead to a spill of",33
NA,"board, we believe the bar has been set too",33
NA,low. We believe that an active minority,33
NA,could disrupt company proceedings if this,33
NA,bill is passed as it is.,33
NA,We will be moving an amendment in,33
NA,relation to the threshold for rejecting the,33
NA,"remuneration report. As currently proposed,",33
NA,the threshold for the two-strikes rule is 25,33
NA,per cent of votes cast. The coalition will be,33
NA,moving an amendment to require the,33
NA,threshold to be 25 per cent of the total votes,33
NA,"available to be cast, and this is an important",33
NA,amendment. Twenty-five per cent of the,33
NA,votes cast means that you could have seven,33
NA,per cent of company shareholders voting to,33
NA,"remove a board. This is dangerous because,",33
NA,if you had an active minority wanting to,33
NA,disrupt the ongoing proceedings of a,33
NA,"company, with this threshold they could do",33
NA,just that. We want to introduce an,33
NA,amendment which provides a sensible,33
NA,safeguard. Moving to a threshold of 25 per,33
NA,on cent of the total votes available to be cast,33
NA,seems to me a very sensible proposition and,33
NA,one which the House and the parliament,33
NA,"should be able to agree on. As I have said,",33
NA,this will prevent a small number of,33
NA,shareholders dictating a result which is not,33
NA,shared by a majority of the passive non-,33
NA,voting shareholders. We will not oppose this,33
NA,bill but we want to make a sensible,33
NA,amendment which provides balance to it. I,33
NA,urge the House and the parliament to support,33
NA,our amendment.,33
Ms SMYTH ,La Trobe) (09:58): I am,33
NA,very pleased to speak on the Corporations,33
NA,Amendment (Improving Accountability on,33
NA,Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill,33
NA,"2010, which strikes such a sensible balance",33
NA,in the community debate around director and,33
NA,"executive salaries, bonuses and incentives. I",33
NA,am also pleased to see that the opposition,33
NA,will ultimately be supporting the bulk of this,33
NA,"the legislation, although, given the remarks of",33
NA,some of those speakers during the course of,33
NA,"this debate, it has obviously been quite a",33
NA,struggle to reach that very reasonable view. I,33
NA,have been particularly interested to hear,33
NA,remarks from opposition members in the,33
NA,"debate about overregulation, which is quite a",33
NA,curious line of argument for a group of,33
NA,people who are ultimately going to support,33
NA,this bill. I really have to admire the ability of,33
NA,those members opposite who ran that line of,34
NA,argument with no shame. It is quite a,34
NA,balancing act and quite a skill. Some of those,34
NA,opposite seem to think that the coalition had,34
NA,a marvellous track record in minimising,34
NA,regulation when in government. I suspect,34
NA,that those members were possibly harking,34
NA,back to the wafer-thin volume of Work,34
NA,"Choices regulations, or possibly the mere",34
NA,pamphlet that was John Howard's GST,34
NA,"legislation. I really have a feeling that,",34
NA,"during the break, some members opposite",34
NA,have been passing around old Family Ties,34
NA,"DVDs, because there is more than a little bit",34
NA,of Alex P Keaton in the debate we have seen,34
NA,"from the other side of the chamber, both in",34
NA,this session and at the end of the last. They,34
NA,seem to still be convinced by a curious and,34
NA,entirely fictional notion that they stand for,34
NA,small government and lessening regulation-,34
NA,"and, suddenly, Reagan is back in the White",34
NA,House. They may want to have a quick recap,34
NA,on some of the regulatory interventions of,34
NA,the Howard government during its decade,34
NA,and more in office to perhaps disabuse,34
NA,"themselves of that view. In any event, it is",34
NA,more than a little disingenuous to come to,34
NA,this place and masquerade as a free,34
NA,marketeer and then proceed to support the,34
NA,legislation with little more than a fig leaf,34
NA,amendment. But I will leave all that aside,34
NA,"now because, as with so many other things,",34
NA,the opposition's views on this legislation,34
NA,"ultimately will not rate, even as a footnote.",34
NA,This legislation developed by the,34
NA,government is a timely and even-handed,34
NA,regulatory response to genuine community,34
NA,concerns about executive remuneration.,34
NA,Those concerns came to the fore during the,34
NA,global financial crisis. Members of the,34
NA,opposition have said that we should not try,34
NA,to drag down people who have done well for,34
NA,"themselves-that is, executives who have",34
NA,been paid significant sums-as though that,34
NA,"was the intention of the legislation. No, it is",34
NA,"about making sure that mums and dads, self-",34
NA,funded retirees and all others who invest in,34
NA,shares directly and indirectly can be,34
NA,confident that the savings they have scraped,34
NA,together to buy a few shares are not being,34
NA,squandered and that the companies they,34
NA,invest in are being managed sensibly and,34
NA,prudently.,34
NA,Obviously this legislation will have,34
NA,"consequences for remuneration itself. But,",34
NA,"more importantly, the legislation is focused",34
NA,on ensuring the confidence of the community,34
NA,"generally, and investors in equities in",34
NA,"particular, in the prudent management of the",34
NA,companies in which so many Australians,34
NA,invest their earnings. The bill responds to,34
NA,both the matters raised during the,34
NA,Productivity Commission inquiry on this,34
NA,issue and the findings of the commission.,34
NA,The commission took into account very,34
NA,wide-ranging submissions from the,34
NA,"community, after extensive consultation. It",34
NA,noted in its report that the prime motivation,34
NA,for its enquiry was a 'widespread perception,34
NA,that executives have been rewarded for,34
NA,failure or simply good luck'. The report goes,34
NA,on to say that 'certainly in some periods and,34
NA,"for some CEOs, pay outcomes appear",34
NA,inconsistent with a reasonably efficient,34
NA,executive labour market'. This is reflected in,34
NA,the submission made to the enquiry by,34
NA,"Professor David Peetz, of Griffith",34
NA,University. Professor Peetz's submission,34
NA,notes that the growth rate of CEO pay,34
NA,between 1971 and 2008 was around 470 per,34
NA,"cent, while for the same period average",34
NA,weekly earnings growth was around 54per,34
NA,"cent. On any sensible view, members will",34
NA,certainly realise that that is out of kilter with,34
NA,community expectations about what are,34
NA,reasonable levels of pay for CEOs.,34
NA,The Productivity Commission noted:,34
NA,If the community came to regard executive,35
NA,as the product of poor corporate governance or,35
NA,"weak regulation, this could undermine public",35
NA,"confidence in the corporate sector itself,",35
NA,potentially detracting from the ability to raise,35
NA,equity capital and distorting the allocation in,35
NA,investment funds.,35
NA,This is a genuinely held concern about,35
NA,maintaining public confidence in our,35
NA,companies. It goes to whether people will,35
NA,believe that putting their money into shares,35
NA,"is a good prospect, whether it will generate a",35
NA,good return or whether it will simply prop up,35
NA,inefficient and overpaid executives. These,35
NA,are reasons why a regulatory response of a,35
NA,balanced and reasonable kind that is being,35
NA,presented here today is responsible and,35
NA,timely.,35
NA,The Productivity Commission considered,35
NA,that certain trends in executive and director,35
NA,remuneration in Australia were inconsistent,35
NA,with effective executive labour markets and,35
NA,may actually have had the effect of,35
NA,weakening company performance. In,35
NA,"particular, it cited incentive payments and",35
NA,termination payments as examples of such,35
NA,"trends, noting that certain executive",35
NA,incentive payments may have delivered an,35
NA,unintended upside and that some termination,35
NA,payments considered by the Productivity,35
NA,Commission seemed excessive. Although the,35
NA,commission ultimately found that Australia's,35
NA,existing corporate governance,35
NA,remuneration framework does rank highly,35
NA,"internationally, it made",35
NA,recommendations to improve,35
NA,framework; many of those recommendations,35
NA,are reflected in the bill before us.,35
NA,"Members will recall that, in early 2009,",35
NA,this government announced reforms to limit,35
NA,excessive termination benefits given to,35
NA,outgoing directors and executives. This was,35
NA,the beginning of reform in this area and we,35
NA,are now taking the next steps. My own,35
NA,"experience in working with boards, and in",35
NA,"pay relation to corporate governance, does lead",35
NA,me to expect that most company boards will,35
NA,act appropriately in relation to director and,35
NA,executive pay and that they will and do give,35
NA,due regard to the expectations of,35
NA,shareholders. We know that many boards are,35
NA,already very mindful of their responsibilities,35
NA,and community expectations in this regard.,35
NA,We also know that they take very seriously,35
NA,their commitments to corporate social,35
NA,responsibility. It will be only those boards,35
NA,which are out of step with the kinds of,35
NA,shareholder expectations and community,35
NA,standards which are likely to be subject to,35
NA,the two strikes provisions of the bill. So I do,35
NA,consider that the bill reaches a very sensible,35
NA,balance between the interests of,35
NA,"shareholders, the expectations of the wider",35
NA,community and the desire of businesses to,35
NA,give incentives to their executives to,35
NA,generate growth.,35
NA,"Importantly, this bill will enable",35
NA,shareholders to hold directors to account for,35
NA,their decisions on executive salaries. It will,35
NA,better enable conflicts of interest in the,35
NA,remuneration-setting process to be,35
NA,addressed. It will increase transparency and,35
NA,accountability in matters of executive pay. It,35
NA,"is appropriate that shareholders, who",35
NA,ultimately bear the risk associated with the,35
NA,performance of companies in which they,35
NA,"hold equity, have an opportunity to",35
NA,and thoroughly scrutinise remuneration,35
NA,packages. The bill does this and provides for,35
NA,various those safeguards and balancing measures,35
NA,that through a variety of means. Speakers on this,35
NA,side in the debate have already referred to,35
NA,"the two-strikes test, which would arise in the",35
NA,context of a company putting its,35
NA,remuneration to shareholder vote. It is a,35
NA,measure that is consistent with the,35
NA,underlying expectations in the Corporations,35
NA,"Act that directors will be responsible for, and",35
NA,"accountable to, shareholders in relation to all",35
NA,"aspects of the management of a company,",36
NA,including executive remuneration.,36
NA,"As we have heard, the bill also includes",36
NA,measures relating to remuneration,36
NA,"consultants, which will deliver greater",36
NA,transparency for shareholders as they will be,36
NA,in a position to assess potential conflicts,36
NA,interest in a more successful way. The bill,36
NA,will help to prevent conflicts of interest by,36
NA,prohibiting key management personnel and,36
NA,their related shareholding entities from,36
NA,voting on remuneration related resolutions.,36
NA,The bill also seeks to ensure that the link,36
NA,between remuneration and performance is,36
NA,maintained by prohibiting directors and,36
NA,executives from hedging any incentive,36
NA,"remuneration afforded to them. Finally, the",36
NA,bill contains measures to limit the,36
NA,remuneration details required to be disclosed,36
NA,in the remuneration report to the key,36
NA,management personnel of the consolidated,36
NA,entity. This simplifies the disclosures in the,36
NA,remuneration report to enable shareholders to,36
NA,better assess and understand the company's,36
NA,remuneration arrangements. It is intended to,36
NA,"reduce the regulatory burden on companies,",36
NA,while maintaining an appropriate level of,36
NA,accountability.,36
NA,"In conclusion, despite the observations",36
NA,made by those on-again off-again free,36
NA,marketeers on the opposition benches about,36
NA,"overregulation, members should understand",36
NA,that this bill strikes a balance between the,36
NA,"interests of shareholders, the expectations",36
NA,the wider community and a desire of,36
NA,business to give appropriate incentives to,36
NA,their executives to generate growth. It goes,36
NA,no further in amending the Corporations Act,36
NA,than is necessary to achieve those very,36
NA,eminently sensible aims.,36
Mr TUDGE ,Aston) (10:08): I rise to,36
NA,speak on the Corporations Amendment,36
NA,(Improving Accountability on Director and,36
NA,Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. As you,36
NA,"would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, this",36
NA,bill arises out of the recommendations of the,36
NA,Productivity Commission report into,36
NA,executive remuneration. It reported on 4,36
NA,"January 2010, and this bill aims to",36
NA,of implement its recommendations. We on this,36
NA,side of the House support the intent of this,36
NA,"bill, and the coalition will not be opposing",36
NA,"the bill. However, I have some reservations",36
NA,in relation to it which I would like to outline,36
NA,today. Some of the measures are overly,36
NA,prescriptive and I am not convinced they will,36
NA,actually be effective in addressing the,36
NA,particular problem which we are concerned,36
NA,about.,36
NA,"To properly assess this bill, there are three",36
NA,"questions that we should be asking. First,",36
NA,what are the problems that we are trying to,36
NA,"fix? Second, are the existing mechanisms",36
NA,"sufficient to fix those problems? Third, will",36
NA,the proposals that are on the table in this bill,36
NA,work to fix the problems? I would like to go,36
NA,through each of those three questions in turn.,36
NA,"First of all, what are the problems that this",36
NA,bill is trying to fix? There is a community,36
NA,"concern with executive salaries, particularly",36
NA,those for publicly listed companies. There,36
NA,are many senior executives in this country,36
NA,who are earning very large amounts of,36
NA,money on an annual basis. There are about,36
NA,"nine people in the banking sector, I",36
NA,"understand, who earn above $5 million per",36
NA,"of annum. In the mining sector, there are people",36
NA,earning up to $15 million or $16 million per,36
NA,annum who are heading up publicly listed,36
NA,companies. The managing director of Coles,36
NA,apparently earns in excess of $8 million.,36
NA,These are extraordinary amounts of,36
NA,money by anyone's measure. I personally,36
NA,struggle to see how anyone is worth that,36
NA,"amount of money, but a high salary alone",36
NA,does not necessarily mean there is a problem.,36
NA,The owners of a company should be able to,37
NA,pay whatever they believe is appropriate to,37
NA,"their executives. After all, it is their",37
NA,company. If the owners of the company,37
NA,believe that their CEO should be paid,37
NA,"$500,000, that is their decision. It should not",37
NA,be the job of the government to interfere,37
NA,with those decisions of the owners of,37
NA,companies to determine what the appropriate,37
NA,remuneration is for their executives. A,37
NA,"problem only exists if the board, which sets",37
NA,the salary on behalf of the owners of the,37
NA,"company, the shareholders, is not acting in",37
NA,the best interests of the shareholders in,37
NA,"setting that remuneration-that is, there is an",37
NA,agency problem there or a conflict of interest,37
NA,arises.,37
NA,The government has not presented,37
NA,coherent evidence that directors of,37
NA,Australian companies are indeed acting,37
NA,against the interests of their shareholders,37
NA,when setting executive remuneration.,37
NA,"However, there is certainly a belief that",37
NA,"sometimes this is the case, and I believe that",37
NA,"it is sometimes the case, particularly when",37
NA,executives are remunerated very highly,37
NA,despite the fact that a business might be,37
NA,"collapsing, or when an executive receives a",37
NA,large bonus when that executive may not,37
NA,have had much to do with the performance,37
NA,"of a company but rather it is due to, for",37
NA,"example, commodity prices increasing or",37
NA,due to a government regulation which has,37
NA,underpinned the performance of that,37
NA,particular company.,37
NA,That brings me to my second question: are,37
NA,the existing mechanisms available to fix the,37
NA,"problem sufficient? As parliamentarians, we",37
NA,need to ensure that shareholders have,37
NA,appropriate degrees of protection and,37
NA,appropriate regulations to ensure that their,37
NA,interests and the interests of directors and,37
NA,executives are aligned. Shareholders need to,37
NA,be properly informed and properly,37
NA,empowered. But what are the existing,37
NA,mechanisms and are they sufficient? Already,37
NA,in the Corporations Act there are several,37
NA,mechanisms. There are the fiduciary duties.,37
NA,Directors have a legal obligation to act in the,37
NA,"best interests of their shareholders, and there",37
NA,are some quite significant penalties if they do,37
NA,"not do that. Second, there are some",37
NA,protections for minority interests in the,37
NA,"Corporations Law. Finally, there is the",37
NA,ability for shareholders to sack directors if,37
NA,they do not believe that the directors are,37
NA,adequately representing their interests or if,37
NA,they have any concern in relation to the,37
NA,actions of the directors.,37
NA,All of those are available presently.,37
NA,"However, for small shareholders I",37
NA,understand that it is difficult to access some,37
NA,"of those provisions. However, those",37
NA,provisions in the Corporations Law are the,37
NA,basic building blocks of the law that exist,37
NA,presently. What the Productivity,37
NA,"Commission says is that, despite the",37
NA,"presence of those existing protections, there",37
NA,is at least the opportunity for perception of,37
NA,conflicts of interest to arise and that this,37
NA,should be addressed directly. I support those,37
NA,intentions. That brings me to my third,37
NA,question: will the proposals on the table in,37
NA,the form of this bill actually fix the problem?,37
NA,"There are seven measures in this bill and,",37
NA,"while some of them are worthwhile, I do",37
NA,have reservations about whether they will,37
NA,make a decisive impact and I do believe that,37
NA,there will be some negative impacts,37
NA,associated with some of the provisions. The,37
NA,"seven measures, all up, are intended to",37
NA,empower shareholders and prevent any real,37
NA,or perceived conflicts of interest. That intent,37
NA,"is a good one, but we need to look at the",37
NA,details to determine whether or not that,37
NA,intent is actually delivered upon and whether,37
NA,or not the downsides of being overly,37
NA,prescriptive will outweigh the benefits.,37
NA,Some of the seven measures do seem,37
NA,"immediately sensible, in fact so sensible that",37
NA,it is surprising that some companies are not,38
NA,enacting these measures already. For,38
NA,"example, one of the measures prevents key",38
NA,management personnel and parties closely,38
NA,related to them from participating in non-,38
NA,binding shareholder votes on remuneration,38
NA,and on spill resolutions. Clearly there would,38
NA,be a perception of a conflict of interest,38
NA,beneficiaries of the remuneration report were,38
NA,to vote on that remuneration report. So this,38
NA,seems to be a sensible provision.,38
NA,"Second, the bill will prohibit an executive",38
NA,hedging his or her executive remuneration.,38
NA,"These days, executive remuneration is",38
NA,structured so that the interests of the,38
NA,executive are very closely aligned with the,38
NA,"interests of the shareholders-so, if",38
NA,"shareholders do well, the executive should be",38
NA,better remunerated. But there have been,38
NA,instances where some executives have taken,38
NA,hedges on the side such that their interests,38
NA,"are less aligned, meaning that a change in",38
NA,shareholder interests will not have the same,38
NA,impact on the remuneration of those,38
NA,individuals. This particular measure will,38
NA,outlaw executives hedging against their,38
NA,remuneration structure. Again that seems,38
NA,like a reasonable and sensible thing to do and,38
NA,again I am surprised that directors would,38
NA,indeed today allow their executives to hedge,38
NA,against the executive remuneration,38
NA,incentives.,38
NA,I think the cherry-picking rules included,38
NA,in this bill are also sensible as they also,38
NA,empower shareholders. With some of the,38
NA,"other measures, however, I question the",38
NA,impact. I have reservations about whether,38
NA,they will make a significant difference in,38
NA,addressing the problem of unaligned interests,38
NA,between shareholders and directors and I do,38
NA,not think that executive remuneration as a,38
NA,whole will come down as a result of this bill.,38
NA,There are also some potential downsides,38
NA,to this bill. Overall it does add to the,38
NA,regulatory burden and the measures are very,38
NA,"prescriptive. Joe Hockey, when introducing",38
NA,"the coalition's response to this bill, said:",38
NA,The best way to support business is often for the,38
NA,government to get out of the way.,38
NA,if the I think we should always be very careful,38
NA,when introducing new regulations on top of,38
NA,all the existing regulations that companies,38
NA,have to abide by. When you look at some of,38
NA,"the measures in this bill, they do appear to be",38
NA,"very prescriptive. For example, one of the",38
NA,measures dictates how a company is to,38
NA,engage remuneration consultants. It seems to,38
NA,me that for this parliament to be determining,38
NA,how a company should engage remuneration,38
NA,"consultants, or any other consultants, is very",38
NA,prescriptive. Surely it is up to the company,38
NA,to determine how it will engage consultants,38
NA,and the terms on which it will engage them?,38
NA,"In relation to that provision, the president of",38
NA,the Business Council of Australia pointed,38
NA,out:,38
NA,This is inevitably going to distract directors from,38
NA,"their most important roles, which are not the",38
NA,"minutiae of supervising remuneration consultants,",38
NA,but much more important roles of making wise,38
NA,"decisions about business direction, major",38
NA,investments and the like.,38
NA,"The no vacancy rule, one of the seven",38
NA,"measures of this bill, also has potential",38
NA,downsides. The principle inherent in that,38
NA,"will provision is again sound, but there are",38
NA,potential downsides in that it will reduce,38
NA,flexibility in how boards operate. Again,38
NA,referring to the Business Council of,38
NA,"Australia, they point out that sometimes",38
NA,there are very good reasons to appoint fewer,38
NA,than the maximum number of directors at a,38
NA,particular time-the board may want to limit,38
NA,"expenses, the maximum number may be too",38
NA,large to enable effective decision making or,38
NA,the board may be deliberately waiting for,38
NA,"someone with a particular specialist expertise minimum wage, while",39
NA,to go onto the board. This measure in the,39
NA,is going to force the board to make a rapid,39
NA,decision about a vacancy. I also have some,39
NA,concerns in relation to the two-strikes test,39
NA,"and how it will operate. Indeed, the coalition",39
NA,will be moving amendments in this regard.,39
NA,"In summary, having gone through the",39
NA,three questions I think we should be asking,39
NA,ourselves to properly assess this bill-is,39
NA,there a problem; are the existing mechanisms,39
NA,sufficient; and will the proposal fix the,39
NA,problems?-I come down marginally in,39
NA,favour of the bill. I hope it will have the,39
NA,"impact intended, but I have my doubts. If it",39
NA,"achieves nothing else, however, this bill",39
NA,should send a clear message to corporate,39
NA,Australia that the Australian people and its,39
NA,representatives in this parliament are,39
NA,concerned about excessive executive,39
NA,remuneration and that we do want,39
NA,corporations to be responsible in this regard.,39
NA,If corporations get that message and act upon,39
NA,"that message, I think that will have more",39
NA,impact on this issue than any regulations we,39
NA,might introduce in this House.,39
NA,Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby),39
NA,(10:23): We are here today speaking on this,39
NA,bill for some important policy reasons that,39
NA,have a deep impact on our nation's character,39
NA,and Australia's egalitarian culture and,39
NA,traditions. Executive pay has seen some,39
NA,exceptional growth since the 1990s-around,39
NA,13 per cent per year in real terms for the,39
NA,100 companies and 16 per cent for,39
NA,"companies in the ASX top 50. In 2008-09,",39
NA,the estimated total remuneration for CEOs of,39
NA,the top 20 companies was around $7.2,39
NA,"million, or 110 times the average wage. This",39
NA,rapid growth in executive pay has been,39
NA,occurring at the very same time that these,39
NA,companies have been calling for wage,39
NA,restraint for their own employees and in the,39
NA,economy at large and opposition has been,39
NA,expressed to even modest increases in the,39
NA,their peak,39
NA,"bill organisation, the Business Council of",39
NA,"Australia, was barracking for the coalition's",39
NA,"unfair Work Choices legislation, which had,",39
NA,"as its sole objective, the driving down of",39
NA,wages for ordinary Australian families.,39
NA,While we are talking about the salaries of,39
NA,"the very wealthy in our society, I want to",39
NA,state that I do not think that it is in,39
NA,Australia's national interest for the gap,39
NA,between top-income earners and lowand,39
NA,average-income earners to continue to,39
NA,increase at the rapid pace that we have seen,39
NA,in recent decades.,39
NA,The bill before the House may go some,39
NA,way towards reigning in the excesses of,39
NA,"executive remuneration, but it will not fix the",39
NA,structural problems arising from the existing,39
NA,income divide in Australia. I do not see how,39
NA,it is in anyone's interest if low-income,39
NA,"earners are forced to struggle to feed, clothe,",39
NA,house and transport themselves and their,39
NA,"families, despite being in full-time paid",39
NA,employment.,39
NA,As has been noted recently by the,39
NA,"Secretary of United Voice, Louise Tarrant,",39
NA,the recent history of Australia's economic,39
NA,development has seen a seen a restructuring,39
NA,of our economy so that risk has increasingly,39
NA,shifted from business and government to,39
NA,individual workers. This shift of risk has,39
NA,occurred through the loss of security of,39
NA,employment and the erosion of workplace,39
NA,"top protections such as sick leave, minimum",39
NA,hours and penalties.,39
NA,"Indeed, the coalition's Work Choices laws",39
NA,were designed to accelerate that shift of risk,39
NA,even further on to workers. Yet this transfer,39
NA,of risk has occurred at the very same time as,39
NA,corporate executives have increasingly been,39
NA,rewarding themselves for high-risk,39
NA,"strategies, in particular through skyrocketing",39
NA,performance pay. That is why improving the,39
NA,accountability and transparency of executive,39
NA,remuneration is a welcome reform to,40
NA,Australia's framework of corporate,40
NA,governance systems for those of us on this,40
NA,side of the House and the constituencies that,40
NA,we represent. We believe that governments,40
NA,have an important role to play to ensure that,40
NA,our market based economy functions,40
NA,efficiently and effectively. That is because,40
NA,we believe that corporations are created by,40
NA,"government, not by god, and the laws under",40
NA,which they operate are the laws created by,40
NA,people in this place and not the laws of,40
NA,nature.,40
NA,Government regulation ensures that our,40
NA,economy works in the way that best reflects,40
NA,"the interests of the broader community, of",40
NA,our interests as a society at large. In,40
NA,Australia we are fortunate to have a robust,40
NA,system of regulation in the corporate and,40
NA,financial sector and the measures in this,40
NA,represent further sensible and rational,40
NA,reforms to the corporate sector.,40
NA,The reforms being put forward in this,40
NA,legislation have come about following a,40
NA,thoroughgoing review by the Productivity,40
NA,Commission. I commend the Productivity,40
NA,Commission for their informative report and,40
NA,their contribution to knowledge in this,40
NA,subject area. In their report on executive,40
NA,"remuneration, the Productivity Commission",40
NA,noted that Australia's corporate governance,40
NA,and remuneration framework is highly rated,40
NA,internationally.,40
NA,Our strong system of corporate,40
NA,governance served Australians well through,40
NA,the global financial crisis and it made the,40
NA,difference between the situation we faced in,40
NA,Australia and that faced by other countries,40
NA,our region and in the Western world. But it,40
NA,not the nature of a reformist government like,40
NA,ours merely to be complacent and to rest on,40
NA,our laurels. That is why the Gillard,40
NA,government and the Parliamentary Secretary,40
NA,"to the Treasurer, the member for Lindsay,",40
NA,have brought this legislation before the,40
NA,House. It is Labor's view that the,40
NA,marketplace in relation to the remuneration,40
NA,of directors and executives is not working,40
NA,effectively as it could or should be. We,40
NA,believe that the appropriate mechanism to,40
NA,redress this is to increase the accountability,40
NA,of boards to the owners of companies-that,40
NA,"is, their shareholders.",40
NA,The measures in the bill before the House,40
NA,contain a number of provisions that will,40
NA,strengthen the accountability of boards and,40
NA,"executives to their shareholders. First, the",40
NA,bill introduces a two-strikes rule that will,40
NA,require a board to better respond to,40
NA,shareholder concerns on remuneration issues.,40
NA,The mechanism for this two-strikes rule will,40
NA,be triggered where a company faces a 'no',40
NA,bill vote by 25 per cent or more on its,40
NA,remuneration report for two years running.,40
NA,"Where this occurs, and the board has not",40
NA,satisfactorily responded to shareholder,40
NA,"concerns, that board will be subject to a",40
NA,'spill' resolution. If more than 50 per cent of,40
NA,"eligible shareholders vote to spill the board,",40
NA,there will be a requirement for the directors,40
NA,to stand for re-election at a subsequent,40
NA,meeting within 90 days.,40
NA,This bill also contains important measures,40
NA,regarding the treatment of remuneration,40
NA,consultants to ensure better accountability,40
NA,and transparency in their role regarding,40
NA,remuneration matters. Transparency will be,40
NA,enhanced because companies will be,40
NA,required to disclose details relating to the use,40
NA,"of remunerations consultants, including the",40
NA,in consultant used and the payment made to,40
NA,is that consultant for the advice or any other,40
NA,"advice provided to the company. I fail to see,",40
NA,"as the member for Aston said previously,",40
NA,how this is some form or onerous or,40
NA,burdensome regulation on,41
NA,shareholders or companies at large.,41
NA,"In addition, boards will be required to",41
NA,approve the engagement of remuneration,41
NA,consultants and these consultants will be,41
NA,required to report their remuneration,41
NA,recommendation to the non-executive,41
NA,directors of the remuneration committee of,41
NA,the company concerned. Directors and,41
NA,executives will no longer be able to,41
NA,participate in the non-binding shareholder,41
NA,vote on their own remuneration or on the,41
NA,spill motions. This measure will remove a,41
NA,significant conflict of interest-which has,41
NA,been described by members opposite as,41
NA,"completely obvious-between directors,",41
NA,executives and their votes in regard to,41
NA,"remuneration matters, and it will also extend",41
NA,to votes by key management personnel and,41
NA,their closely related parties in regard to their,41
NA,undirected proxies.,41
NA,Another common criticism made of,41
NA,executive remuneration is that it has focused,41
NA,too much on rewarding risk and short-term,41
NA,results rather than the long-term performance,41
NA,of the company. This situation was a,41
NA,particular characteristic of corporate,41
NA,behaviour in the United States in the lead-up,41
NA,"to the global financial crisis and, regrettably,",41
NA,I believe it has yet to be satisfactorily,41
NA,"resolved there, much to the detriment of",41
NA,American civil society. While the situation in,41
NA,Australia does not approach the level of,41
NA,"corporate scandal in the United States, it is",41
NA,nevertheless critical to continue to be,41
NA,vigilant about defending the integrity of our,41
NA,system of corporate governance and to,41
NA,ensure that government regulation is working,41
NA,effectively to achieve its aims.,41
NA,I think the bill before the House today,41
NA,demonstrates that where a system of self-,41
NA,regulation does not work then further,41
NA,regulatory steps need to be taken to guide,41
NA,market mechanisms towards,41
NA,"boards, outcomes. It is a matter of public record that",41
NA,the existing system of non-binding votes has,41
NA,not had the desired effect on the actions of,41
NA,some boards in regards to the remuneration,41
NA,matters in their companies.,41
NA,The standout example that I am very,41
NA,"familiar with here is Telstra, which",41
NA,notoriously in 2007 was repudiated by an,41
NA,outstanding 66 per cent of shareholders for,41
NA,its handling of remuneration matters. The,41
NA,board at the time blithely ignored the vote,41
NA,and shareholders were powerless to do,41
NA,anything about it. The arrogance of the,41
NA,Telstra board in 2007 was shocking and was,41
NA,rightly condemned by many in the financial,41
NA,media and more broadly. It was ironic that at,41
NA,the very same time that this company was,41
NA,taking a very harsh attitude towards the,41
NA,treatment of remuneration for its own,41
NA,employees and their own workplace rights it,41
NA,was operating with complete disregard to,41
NA,"community norms, as expressed by its",41
NA,"shareholders, in relation to its own executive",41
NA,pay. I know that the current executive team,41
NA,at Telstra are working hard to redress the,41
NA,toxic culture that had developed as a result of,41
NA,previous management regimes and,41
NA,"employment practices, and the blithe",41
NA,disrespect and disregard for community,41
NA,"values, and everybody welcomes any move",41
NA,towards a more civilised and mutually,41
NA,respectful corporate culture in that company,41
NA,and elsewhere. I can only wish it well in this,41
NA,regard.,41
NA,There are alternative proposals that have,41
NA,been talked about in this area. Some say that,41
NA,"this regulation does not go far enough, and I",41
NA,must say that at times I have had sympathy,41
NA,with that view. The alternative proposal put,41
NA,by members opposite and foreshadowed in,41
NA,their amendment is that we should lift the bar,41
NA,"even higher for shareholders-that is, the",41
NA,triggering of the two-strikes rule should not,41
NA,"better be based on 25 per cent of the votes cast,",41
NA,which would trigger the spill motion and the,41
NA,"requisite action of the shareholders, but that",42
NA,it should be based on 25 per cent of the votes,42
NA,that are eligible to be cast at an annual,42
NA,general meeting of a company. Anybody,42
NA,who has had any experience of the practical,42
NA,operation of annual general meetings of most,42
NA,"companies, particularly large companies with",42
NA,"a large share registry, will know that this",42
NA,the bar to an almost impossible level because,42
NA,it would be a very rare event indeed where,42
NA,25 per cent of the eligible votes would be,42
NA,cast in a vote on a matter such as this.,42
NA,While many of those opposite have risen,42
NA,to speak in favour of the sentiment and the,42
NA,intent behind this bill-to put more,42
NA,regulation and give more control to the,42
NA,shareholders to address outrageous,42
NA,remuneration packages by executives-their,42
NA,proposed amendment to this regulation will,42
NA,have quite the opposite effect. It would,42
NA,neuter the effect of the bill and neuter the,42
NA,ability of shareholders to have any real say in,42
NA,controlling the remuneration packages of,42
NA,their directors and executives.,42
NA,The social contract in Australia that was,42
NA,the bedrock of our culture and our values has,42
NA,been severely challenged as executive pay,42
NA,has skyrocketed in recent decades. We,42
NA,cannot sit by and wring our hands each time,42
NA,we hear of multi-million dollar salaries being,42
NA,paid to corporate executives which are,42
NA,seemingly unrelated to the performance of,42
NA,their companies and the returns to,42
NA,shareholders. That is why I support the,42
NA,sensible measures in the bill before the,42
NA,"House today, and that is also why I support",42
NA,the voices of others within the community in,42
NA,"their continued campaigns to ensure fairness,",42
NA,security and dignity for all Australian,42
NA,"workers, and that we do everything we can to",42
NA,"narrow the gaps between the wealthy, the",42
NA,average Australians and the poor in this,42
NA,country.,42
Mr BANDT ,Melbourne) (10:36): The,42
NA,health and success of a society is best judged,42
NA,by the level of equality between its citizens.,42
NA,"The gap between the rich and poor, the",42
NA,extent to which someone profits from the,42
NA,labour of others and the capacity of someone,42
NA,to reap enormous wealth at the expense of,42
NA,lifts the Commonwealth have always been a,42
NA,measure of a sustainable and stable society.,42
NA,During the first three-quarters of the 20th,42
NA,"century, Australia, like much of the",42
NA,"developed world, was narrowing the gap",42
NA,between the highest and lowest incomes. The,42
NA,1970s were the high point with the gap,42
NA,between rich and poor at its smallest perhaps,42
NA,"in centuries, but since then the gap has been",42
NA,"growing again, with most of the positive",42
NA,trends of the 20th century wiped out.,42
NA,Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics,42
NA,we can examine the income distribution,42
NA,between households. If disposable income,42
NA,"was equally distributed between households,",42
NA,the bottom 20 per cent of households would,42
NA,have 20 per cent of total income and the top,42
NA,20 per cent of households would also have,42
NA,"20 per cent of total income. In fact, the latest",42
NA,ABS figures show that the bottom fifth has,42
NA,"just seven per cent of the income, whereas",42
NA,the top fifth has more than 40 per cent. And,42
NA,"in the four years to 2010, the shares of the",42
NA,four bottom-fifths fell by about 0.5 a,42
NA,"percentage point each, allowing the share of",42
NA,"the top fifth to rise by two per cent. So why,",42
NA,"under both Liberal and Labor governments,",42
NA,has there been this marked increase in,42
NA,inequality?,42
NA,Economic writer Ross Gittins in last year's,42
NA,ACTU Whitlam lecture outlined this recent,42
NA,data and attempted to answer the question.,42
NA,He said:,42
NA,No one can say with any certainly. Various,42
NA,factors could have contributed: the resources,42
NA,boom and the booming sharemarket before the,42
NA,"global financial crisis, the continued rise in",42
NA,executive and finance-sector salaries and maybe,43
NA,the succession of income-tax cuts that benefited,43
NA,people on high incomes.,43
NA,But he went on to say:,43
NA,"It would be a mistake to conclude, however,",43
NA,that all families with income sufficient to put,43
NA,them in the top 20 per cent have benefited,43
NA,equally. It‘s far more likely that the closer,43
NA,to the top of that 20 per cent the better you‘ve,43
NA,done. It‘s even possible that the share of people in,43
NA,"the second-top 10 per cent has declined, as have",43
NA,the shares of the bottom 80 per cent of,43
NA,households.,43
NA,"But it gets worse. According to Gittins,",43
NA,research using income tax statistics show,43
NA,that the top 120th of a per cent of individual,43
NA,taxpayers account for about two per cent of,43
NA,total taxable income. Let's just reflect on,43
NA,that. Someone in the top 0.05 per cent of,43
NA,taxpayers has income about 40 times their,43
NA,proportionate share. Gittins also says:,43
NA,The top 10th of a per cent accounts for 3 per,43
NA,"cent, the top half a per cent for 6 per cent,",43
NA,"1 per cent for 9 per cent, the top 5 per cent for 21",43
NA,per cent and the top 10 per cent for 31 per cent,43
NA,So in fact it is the growth in income of the,43
NA,very top group of people in the wealthiest 20,43
NA,per cent of the income band that is driving,43
NA,this growth in inequality. According to,43
NA,Gittins this means:,43
NA,The shares of these top earners were declining,43
NA,"until the early 1980s, but have increased since",43
NA,"then, with the share of the top 10 per cent",43
NA,growing from 25 per cent to 31 per cent. Why has,43
NA,this happened? I think it would have to do mainly,43
NA,with the explosion in executive salaries and the,43
NA,phenomenal expansion of the phenomenally paid,43
NA,financial services industry.,43
NA,While experiencing a short dip post the,43
NA,"global financial crisis, executive salaries are",43
NA,"continuing to soar, driving up this inequality",43
NA,in Australia. This skyrocketing of executive,43
NA,pay is based on the obscene levels of,43
NA,incentives and bonuses for company,43
NA,executives and has fuelled unsustainable,43
NA,business practices that resulted in the loss of,43
NA,jobs and shareholder wealth. Let's look again,43
NA,at the figures.,43
NA,The average total remuneration of a chief,43
NA,executive of a top-50 company listed on the,43
NA,Australian Securities Exchange in 2010 was,43
NA,$6.4 million. This makes the average CEO's,43
NA,total pay packet almost 100 times that of the,43
NA,you are average worker. This is an obscene,43
NA,difference in remuneration. Why should,43
NA,anyone earn 100 times more than the average,43
NA,worker? Do they work 100 times as hard?,43
NA,Are they carrying out work that is a hundred,43
NA,"times more risky, or difficult or dangerous?",43
NA,The reality is executives are being paid this,43
NA,amount because they are able to get away,43
NA,with it and they have been allowed to get,43
NA,away with it.,43
NA,We can get a greater sense of how unfair,43
NA,this difference is by looking at the increases,43
NA,in executive pay over last financial year.,43
NA,Executive pay rose by an average of almost,43
NA,"the top $1 million, the equivalent of an extra",43
NA,"$18,000 per week. Over the same period, the",43
NA,annual average wage for a full-time worker,43
NA,"rose by just $3,200, or $62 a week-$18,000",43
NA,a week compared with $62 dollars a week.,43
NA,Yet we are constantly hearing lectures about,43
NA,the importance of wage restraint and the,43
NA,worry of a wages break-out amongst,43
NA,working people. What does one even do with,43
NA,"an extra $18,000 a week?",43
NA,This has been a problem for some time,43
NA,with base pay for executives rising by 130,43
NA,"per cent from 2001-2010, while in the same",43
NA,period average weekly earnings only rose by,43
NA,52 per cent. Inflation over the same period,43
NA,"was just 28.6 per cent. Again, we see this",43
NA,incredible difference with average workers,43
NA,gaining modest increases in their pay just,43
NA,"keeping above inflation, while the top end of",43
NA,"town is raking it in, with a whopping",43
NA,doubling of their pay over the last decade.,43
NA,Over the previous financial year across the,43
NA,"economy, profits also soared by 27.5 per",43
NA,cent. This imbalance is even greater in,44
NA,selected industries. Gross operating,44
NA,"mining have risen by 60.6 per cent, while",44
NA,wages grew by just 3.8 per cent.,44
NA,"Construction profits rose by 55.5 per cent,",44
NA,but wages by just 2.9 per cent. And profits in,44
NA,"the information, media",44
NA,telecommunications sector grew by 10 per,44
NA,cent-five times more than wages. Company,44
NA,profits as a share of national income are now,44
NA,"back to the record levels of 2008, while the",44
NA,wages share is the lowest since 1964. So,44
NA,there has been no shortage of funds to fund,44
NA,"wage increases for workers, but corporations",44
NA,have instead funded executive salaries. This,44
NA,"is unfair and unsustainable, and it is little",44
NA,wonder that the community is angry when,44
NA,they are doing it tough and being asked to,44
NA,engage in wage restraint when corporate,44
NA,leaders are filling their own pockets.,44
NA,Here are some examples from last year of,44
NA,incredible increases in CEO pay from 2009,44
NA,"to 2010. Tom Albanese, CEO of Rio Tinto,",44
NA,"got $9,039,000, an increase of 328 per cent.",44
NA,Don Voelte from Woodside Petroleum is on,44
NA,"$8,343,339-also a huge increase. Ralph",44
NA,"Norris, CEO of the Commonwealth Bank,",44
NA,"modest but still a nice little earner, is on",44
NA,"$16,157,746, an increase of 75 per cent. And",44
NA,"the list goes on: David Knox at Santos, $5",44
NA,"million, an increase of 63 per cent; Marius",44
NA,"Kloppers on $11 million, and so on.",44
NA,Something needs to be done to rein in these,44
NA,fat-cat salaries and excessive profits.,44
NA,Something needs to be done to address this,44
NA,growing inequality. The Greens have been,44
NA,seeking action on executive remuneration for,44
NA,some time. We have proposed real and,44
NA,practical measures to limit executive pay.,44
NA,We have moved a number of amendments to,44
NA,the Corporations Act in the past to,44
NA,implement our proposals. The most recent,44
NA,was at the end of 2009 to the Corporations,44
NA,Amendment (Improving Accountability on,44
NA,profits in Termination Payment) Bill.,44
NA,The measures we have proposed include:,44
NA,a cap on total executive remuneration of $5,44
NA,million to stop the excesses of the past,44
NA,decade but also to ensure that the majority of,44
NA,and executives continue to enjoy attractive,44
NA,remuneration packages. The limit that we,44
NA,have proposed is more than 10 times the,44
NA,Prime Minister's salary. We have also,44
NA,proposed: a remuneration formula to set,44
NA,executive pay at 30 times the average,44
NA,employee's wage; a top marginal tax rate of,44
NA,50 per cent for incomes over $1 million a,44
NA,year; and a binding shareholder vote on,44
NA,company remuneration policy. The policy,44
NA,would set minimum standards to be included,44
NA,"in remuneration packages which would, in",44
NA,"turn, place limits on the size of remuneration",44
NA,"packages covering base salaries,",44
NA,performance and termination pay and non-,44
NA,cash rewards. We believe that these,44
NA,"measures are sensible and, if implemented,",44
NA,would have already started to rein in,44
NA,excessive executive salaries.,44
NA,"Unfortunately, the government and the",44
NA,opposition have not had the courage to take,44
NA,strong action on this problem and support,44
NA,"our measures. Instead, we have before us this",44
NA,bill today. The bill implements a number of,44
NA,the recommendations from the Productivity,44
NA,Commission's report from 2009on executive,44
NA,remuneration. The key measure in the bill is,44
NA,the two strike non-binding vote of,44
NA,shareholders on the remuneration report,44
NA,leading to a spill of the board.,44
NA,The first strike will occur when a,44
NA,company's remuneration report receives a no,44
NA,vote of 25 per cent or more. When this,44
NA,"occurs, the company's subsequent",44
NA,"remuneration report, the next year, must",44
NA,include an explanation of the board's,44
NA,proposed actions in response to the no vote,44
NA,or an explanation of why no action has been,45
NA,taken.,45
NA,The second strike occurs when a,45
NA,company's subsequent remuneration report,45
NA,receives a no vote of 25 per cent or more.,45
NA,"When this occurs, shareholders will vote at",45
NA,the same AGM to determine whether the,45
NA,directors will need to stand for re-election. If,45
NA,this spill resolution passes with 50 per cent,45
NA,"or more of eligible votes cast, then the spill",45
NA,meeting will take place within 90 days.,45
NA,While this is a step forward from where,45
NA,"we are now, the Greens would prefer a",45
NA,binding vote of shareholders,45
NA,remuneration policy which would set limits,45
NA,and give the shareholders that ability to,45
NA,configure payments in accordance with,45
NA,common sense. Under the provisions in the,45
NA,bill the potential for a spill of the board,45
NA,two votes at subsequent annual general,45
NA,meetings of shareholders expressing their,45
NA,concern with the remuneration of executives.,45
NA,"There is, therefore, a significant amount of",45
NA,time between shareholders expressing,45
NA,displeasure and being in a position to act.,45
NA,During this time CEOs can continue to be,45
NA,paid obscene salaries.,45
NA,We understand the arguments put by the,45
NA,Productivity Commission against a binding,45
NA,"vote, including that a binding vote would",45
NA,provide significant practical difficulties such,45
NA,as companies not being able to finalise a,45
NA,contract with an executive until shareholder,45
NA,"approval was obtained, and could result in a",45
NA,deadlock arising between shareholders and,45
NA,the board regarding the appropriate levels of,45
NA,executive remuneration. We appreciate that,45
NA,the government's position is to encourage,45
NA,cultural change in large corporations,45
NA,"regarding executive remuneration. However,",45
NA,we continue to hold reservations that these,45
NA,measures will in practical terms work to stop,45
NA,the excessive salaries that I have outlined,45
NA,today. We will be watching carefully how,45
NA,this process works in practice and the extent,45
NA,to which it does create cultural change and,45
NA,rein in executive remuneration packages.,45
NA,The Greens support the other measures in,45
NA,the bill to increase transparency with regard,45
NA,to executive remuneration. These include:,45
NA,increasing transparency and accountability,45
NA,with respect to the use of remuneration,45
NA,"consultants, in particular, that remuneration",45
NA,consultants report to non-executive directors,45
NA,or the remuneration committee; addressing,45
NA,conflicts of interests that exist with directors,45
NA,and executives voting their shares on,45
NA,on remuneration resolutions. We agree that,45
NA,directors and executives with voting shares,45
NA,should not be allowed to vote on the,45
NA,remuneration reports. We also support:,45
NA,ensuring that remuneration remains linked to,45
NA,takes performance by prohibiting hedging of,45
NA,incentive remuneration; requiring,45
NA,shareholder approval for declarations of no,45
NA,vacancy at an annual general meeting;,45
NA,prohibiting proxy holders from cherry-,45
NA,picking the proxies they exercise by,45
NA,requiring that any directed proxies that are,45
NA,"not voted default to the chair, who is",45
NA,required to vote the proxies as directed; and,45
NA,reducing the complexity of the remuneration,45
NA,report by confining disclosures in the report,45
NA,to the key management personnel.,45
NA,These measures also go to implementing,45
NA,some of the principles of executive,45
NA,remuneration agreed to by the G20 in,45
NA,September 2009. They will improve the way,45
NA,companies go about determining,45
NA,"remuneration for executives, and the",45
NA,increased transparency of these measures is,45
NA,"to be welcomed. However, this must be just",45
NA,the first step. Unless we move to serious caps,45
NA,and stronger regulation of executive salaries,45
NA,we will not begin to address the growing,45
NA,inequality we are experiencing in this,45
NA,country.,45
Ms RISHWORTH ,Kingston) (10:50): I,46
NA,rise to support the Corporations Amendment,46
NA,(Improving Accountability on Director and,46
NA,Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011. The,46
NA,global financial crisis around the world put,46
NA,spotlight on and exposed some of the,46
NA,excessive remuneration packages,46
NA,company directors and executives.,46
NA,In Australia in the last 30 years the,46
NA,relativities between the average wage and,46
NA,executive pay have grown exponentially. In,46
NA,"fact, CEO salaries of Australia's largest 300",46
NA,listed companies rose by 28 per cent in,46
NA,07. This is compared to the average full-time,46
NA,income growth of 3.4 per cent over the same,46
NA,period. So there is a significant difference,46
NA,between the rise in CEO salaries and income,46
NA,growth. The community in Australia has,46
NA,registered its concern about this increase in,46
NA,disparity between the average wage income,46
NA,earner and the rise in CEO salaries.,46
NA,"In the financial year just passed,",46
NA,companies on the S&P ASX 100 that filed,46
NA,remuneration reports revealed an average,46
NA,executive salary rise of 12 per cent with the,46
NA,highest being 93 per cent. These pay rises,46
NA,have all occurred despite difficult times and,46
NA,"under difficult conditions, with CEOs, at the",46
NA,"same time, calling for wage constraint for",46
NA,ordinary workers. It is important that the,46
NA,community is listened to when it comes to,46
NA,executive remuneration and that steps are,46
NA,taken to ensure that these salaries do get,46
NA,recognised. We need to ensure that,46
NA,regulation is made to make sure that they are,46
NA,fair and right and that shareholders get,46
NA,voices listened to. I am also certain that,46
NA,members of the House will recall the,46
NA,exposure of unreasonable termination,46
NA,benefits being afforded to departing directors,46
NA,of companies not long after the global,46
NA,financial crisis. The government addressed,46
NA,this issue in its 2009 announcement of,46
NA,reforms aimed at curbing these excessive,46
NA,golden handshake payments. The bill before,46
NA,the House seeks to build on those reforms by,46
NA,further strengthening Australia's,46
NA,a remuneration framework. It is disappointing,46
NA,that while the opposition state that they agree,46
NA,of with the government their amendments,46
NA,effectively aim to keep the status quo. I do,46
NA,hope that the opposition comes to their,46
NA,"senses, listen to community expectations and",46
NA,support the bill before the House.,46
NA,The bill will amend current limitations in,46
NA,2006- order to provide shareholders with more,46
NA,control over the pay of directors.,46
NA,Shareholders are the legal owners of a,46
NA,"company in which they invest. In doing so,",46
NA,they take ownership of the company's risk,46
NA,and also share in the company's profit and,46
NA,loss. Shareholders therefore deserve more,46
NA,control over how the pay of company,46
NA,executives is decided. This bill seeks to,46
NA,empower shareholders to influence their,46
NA,"company's remuneration decisions by, firstly,",46
NA,introducing a two-strikes test.,46
NA,The current Corporations Act requires,46
NA,listed companies to put their remuneration,46
NA,report to a non-binding shareholder vote at,46
NA,"an annual general meeting. However,",46
NA,shareholders have no means of recourse,46
NA,should they implement a strong 'no' vote,46
NA,which is then ignored by the company board.,46
NA,"Under the bill before the House, the first",46
NA,strike will be initiated in the instance where a,46
NA,company's remuneration report receives a,46
NA,'no' vote of 25 per cent or more. This results,46
NA,their in the company being required to provide,46
NA,direct evidence of the shareholders' concerns,46
NA,having been addressed or an outline as to,46
NA,why they have not. If shareholders remain,46
NA,dissatisfied and another vote results in a 'no',46
NA,vote of 25 per cent or more then the second,46
NA,strike is triggered. The second strike gives,46
NA,shareholders the opportunity to vote on a,46
NA,resolution to spill the board and subject,47
NA,directors to re-election. If the spill resolution linked,47
NA,is passed by more than 50 per cent then a,47
NA,spill meeting will provide shareholders with,47
NA,the opportunity to vote on the re-election of,47
NA,each director. The two-strikes test is an,47
NA,important measure that finally holds,47
NA,unresponsive directors accountable for the,47
NA,decisions they make on executive,47
NA,remuneration.,47
NA,This bill also seeks to ensure that,47
NA,consultation between remuneration,47
NA,consultants and company executives remains,47
NA,transparent. A company's remuneration,47
NA,consultant will be required to declare that,47
NA,their recommendations are free from undue,47
NA,influence. As a means of ensuring further,47
NA,"transparency, these recommendations will be",47
NA,provided to non-executive directors or the,47
NA,"remuneration committee, rather than to the",47
NA,company's executive directors. The company,47
NA,will also be required to disclose details,47
NA,regarding the consultant used and the amount,47
NA,they were paid. These measures are focused,47
NA,on ensuring accountability and transparency,47
NA,within the remuneration framework.,47
NA,Shareholders have a right to be in a position,47
NA,"to assess any potential conflict of interest,",47
NA,and this bill takes important steps towards,47
NA,ensuring that this remains the case.,47
NA,As a means of further reducing conflicts,47
NA,"of interest, this bill also prohibits company",47
NA,directors and executives from voting on the,47
NA,remuneration report or the spill resolution.,47
NA,Directors and executives no doubt have an,47
NA,interest in approving their own remuneration,47
NA,agreements. Doing so affords them a,47
NA,considerable amount of power concerning,47
NA,their company's remuneration framework.,47
NA,"This clearly represents a conflict of interest,",47
NA,and the measures proposed in this bill seek to,47
NA,remove that conflict.,47
NA,In line with the government's reforms to,47
NA,"termination benefits, this bill also seeks to",47
NA,ensure that executive remuneration remains,47
NA,to performance. Incentive,47
NA,remuneration is designed to align directors',47
NA,and executives' interests with those of,47
NA,"shareholders; however, the hedging of",47
NA,incentive payments can severely skew this,47
NA,relationship. Directors and executives are,47
NA,currently able to hedge their exposure to,47
NA,incentive remuneration by entering into,47
NA,third-party contracts and effectively,47
NA,mitigating their personal financial interest in,47
NA,their company's success. The use of hedging,47
NA,is completely inconsistent with the values of,47
NA,Australia's remuneration framework.,47
NA,"However, perhaps more concerning is the",47
NA,"real, as well as the perceived, conflict of",47
NA,interest that arises when a director or,47
NA,executive enters into hedging arrangements.,47
NA,Such an arrangement may stand to see the,47
NA,director or executive benefit from a fall in,47
NA,their company's share price. Hedging by,47
NA,directors or executives distorts their,47
NA,responsibilities to their shareholders. The,47
NA,measures in this bill will ensure that the,47
NA,interests of shareholders and of the,47
NA,company's directors and executives remain,47
NA,synchronised.,47
NA,The bill also introduces a measure that,47
NA,prevents boards from announcing 'no,47
NA,vacancy' without the approval of its,47
NA,shareholders. This is an important step,47
NA,towards transferring company decision-,47
NA,making power back to shareholders. The no,47
NA,vacancy rule currently allows boards to,47
NA,govern the composition of the board and,47
NA,"makes it difficult, if not impossible, for non-",47
NA,board-endorsed candidates to be elected.,47
NA,This promotes unaccountability from,47
NA,directors and executives and leaves,47
NA,"shareholders without a voice, given that any",47
NA,candidate seeking to promote change within,47
NA,a company can essentially be prevented from,47
NA,reaching a board position that would allow,47
NA,them to instigate such change.,47
NA,The bill also introduces an amendment,48
NA,which will ensure the enfranchisement of,48
NA,every shareholder who chooses to vote at an,48
NA,"annual general meeting. Currently, all",48
NA,directors except for the chair have the ability,48
NA,to disregard proxy votes that do not align,48
NA,with their personal views regarding a,48
NA,"resolution. Indeed, annual general meetings",48
NA,can be held at times or locations that are not,48
NA,"convenient for all shareholders. As such,",48
NA,many shareholders who are unable to attend,48
NA,in person are able to indicate their position,48
NA,by a proxy vote. These votes should be given,48
NA,just as much weighting as a vote from a,48
NA,"shareholder present at the meeting. However,",48
NA,"instead, these votes can currently be",48
NA,disregarded at a director's discretion. This,48
NA,cherry picking of votes from shareholders,48
NA,who have made specific declarations,48
NA,concerning their vote inevitably results in,48
NA,outcomes that by no means clearly represent,48
NA,the sentiment of shareholders. This bill will,48
NA,ensure that the outcome of a resolution vote,48
NA,reflects shareholder views rather than the,48
NA,cherry picked views of directors. In,48
NA,"conclusion, under request from the",48
NA,"government, the Productivity Commission",48
NA,undertook a broad review of Australia's,48
NA,remuneration framework. The nine-month,48
NA,"review process, which included a total of 170",48
NA,"submissions and a series of public hearings,",48
NA,revealed that Australia's corporate,48
NA,governance and remuneration framework are,48
NA,ranked highly on an international scale.,48
NA,"However, it also recommended a range of",48
NA,reforms to further strengthen Australia's,48
NA,remuneration framework.,48
NA,The bill before the House today,48
NA,effectively responds to these,48
NA,recommendations. It will provide,48
NA,shareholders with a new level of power and,48
NA,ultimately improve the transparency and,48
NA,accountability of company directors and,48
NA,executives. It addresses the conflicts of,48
NA,interest that arise throughout the,48
NA,remuneration process and ensures that the,48
NA,sentiments of shareholders are appropriately,48
NA,represented by directors and executives.,48
NA,While Australia's remuneration,48
NA,"framework is certainly strong, these",48
NA,innovative reforms will eliminate,48
NA,complacency and ensure that it remains,48
NA,effective well into the future. It will better,48
NA,reflect community standards when it comes,48
NA,to remuneration and pay of company,48
NA,"executives, and I therefore commend the bill",48
NA,to the House.,48
Mr ZAPPIA ,Makin) (11:01): I welcome,48
NA,the opportunity to speak on Corporations,48
NA,Amendment (Improving Accountability on,48
NA,Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill,48
NA,"2011, and I commend the member for",48
NA,Kingston for the remarks she has just made,48
NA,on the bill in this place.,48
NA,In recent years public anger about,48
NA,excessive salaries and executive payouts has,48
NA,been widespread. Whilst the spotlight has,48
NA,been taken off executive salaries in recent,48
NA,"times there is little, if any, justification for",48
NA,some of the remuneration we are still seeing.,48
NA,Nor is this issue just a matter for company,48
NA,shareholders. It is a matter that the wider,48
NA,"community has a right to take an interest in,",48
NA,because in most cases the remuneration,48
NA,packages for senior executives have direct,48
NA,implications for the broader community.,48
NA,"That is why this is a public interest issue, and",48
NA,why those people who argue that private,48
NA,sector remuneration is a matter for the,48
NA,private sector and not the business of,48
NA,government are wrong. It is the argument,48
NA,about why this is a matter of public interest,48
NA,that I will address in my remarks on this bill.,48
NA,Possibly every senior management,48
NA,"appointment today is tied to performance,",48
NA,either by way of a performance bonus or,48
NA,simply because renewal of the employment,48
NA,contract is directly tied to performance. In,49
NA,the private sector the most used measure of,49
NA,performance and certainly the most,49
NA,persuasive is the annual profit or loss,49
NA,"statement. Generally, the higher the profits",49
NA,the better the performance is considered.,49
NA,That is what most company owners and,49
NA,shareholders are driven by. Profit can be and,49
NA,"usually is made from a range of actions, but",49
NA,when any of those actions are extreme or,49
NA,irresponsible it is the public that inevitably,49
NA,ends up paying one way or another. And,49
NA,therein lies the public interest test-a test,49
NA,"that could be applied time and again, using",49
NA,many examples in numerous industry sectors,49
NA,over recent years.,49
NA,We have seen farmers being squeezed by,49
NA,"monopoly retailers, manufacturers",49
NA,"transferring their operations overseas, high-",49
NA,risk loan arrangements or investment,49
NA,"schemes, construction shortcuts where safety",49
NA,"standards are not complied with, transport",49
NA,industry drivers placed under unreasonable,49
NA,"delivery deadlines, and collusion or similar",49
NA,practices and possibly corruption creeping,49
NA,into industry practices. Cutting costs and,49
NA,increasing sales are strategies almost,49
NA,universally implemented in business to,49
NA,increase profits-and I will speak more,49
NA,about both these matters. Cutting costs and,49
NA,reducing overheads can be achieved by,49
NA,"investing in modernisation strategies,",49
NA,"upskilling the workforce, streamlining",49
NA,production and other forward-thinking,49
NA,responsible strategies. The alternatives are,49
NA,"reducing labour costs, not complying with",49
NA,"regulatory standards, using",49
NA,"componentry, taking extreme risks and other",49
NA,irresponsible measures-all of which appear,49
NA,to have become commonplace in business.,49
NA,I turn now to labour costs. Labour costs,49
NA,are frequently cut by placing unreasonable,49
NA,"demands on workers, including longer",49
NA,"working hours, which are often unpaid; by",49
NA,reducing the workforce numbers and,49
NA,working employees harder; by paying,49
NA,workers less than fair wages; by,49
NA,subcontracting work out; and by taking work,49
NA,offshore. It is all about squeezing more out,49
NA,of the labour force. The social costs of,49
NA,"unemployment, housing, health and family",49
NA,"breakdown, which inevitably follow when",49
NA,"operations are transferred offshore, workers",49
NA,are placed under unreasonable work,49
NA,"pressure, or work is subcontracted out so",49
NA,employers are no longer responsible for,49
NA,work conditions are all examples of where,49
NA,the consequences are inevitably paid for by,49
NA,the rest of society.,49
NA,We saw the collapse of the financial,49
NA,system because of high-risk lending practices,49
NA,or high-risk investment schemes. This was,49
NA,driven by executives who were in turn,49
NA,motivated by increased profits. Hardworking,49
NA,"people lost their homes, their health, their",49
NA,savings and sometimes their lives because of,49
NA,the decisions of highly remunerated,49
NA,executives. In the five years prior to the 2008,49
NA,"global financial crisis, senior executives of",49
NA,the five largest financial institutions in Wall,49
NA,Street were paid $3.6 billion in,49
NA,remuneration. They profited whilst others,49
NA,lost everything. They were rewarded for their,49
NA,failure.,49
NA,I turn now to the transport sector. Each,49
NA,year around 300 lives are lost and about,49
NA,"5,500 are injured because of cost-cutting in",49
NA,the transport sector. I quote from a,49
NA,submission from the Transport Workers,49
NA,Union from February this year on this very,49
NA,matter:,49
NA,inferior Each road death costs $1.7 million. Each,49
NA,injury in an incident costs $408 000. When the,49
NA,"non-monetised social impact of road deaths,",49
NA,"injuries and illness, family breakdown, pain and",49
NA,suffering is included in the measurement of what,49
NA,road deaths and injuries cost the community-,49
NA,The damages bill is immeasurable. The,49
NA,report attributes the cause of the road,49
NA,transport safety crisis to economic factors;,49
NA,"namely, the low level of driver remuneration",50
NA,and their methods of payment. As made clear,50
NA,"in the NTC report, the high level of control",50
NA,"exercised by clients over price, timing,",50
NA,destination and route causes operators to,50
NA,"bear the costs that, ordinarily, are borne by",50
NA,"customers. Denied a proper return, let alone",50
NA,"a margin that exceeds the cost of capital,",50
NA,"operators undercut each other, bid the price",50
NA,of transport down and attempt to recoup the,50
NA,losses caused by clients from drivers by not,50
NA,paying them for all work performed and by,50
NA,paying them through incentive rates. It says:,50
NA,Because employment is too often conditional,50
NA,on strict compliance with an operator's direction,50
NA,"and client deadlines, drivers are prone to drive",50
NA,"while fatigued, to speed, to take drugs and to",50
NA,skimp on maintenance.,50
NA,All of that arises because someone is trying,50
NA,to make a profit. Usually the CEO or an,50
NA,executive is the person driving that to the,50
NA,point that they do.,50
NA,Mining and construction workers' lives,50
NA,have been put at risk and lives lost or injured,50
NA,because of work practices imposed by,50
NA,employers. The recent spate of mining,50
NA,tragedies exposes some of these practices. In,50
NA,"the building and construction sector, each",50
NA,year around 50 lives are lost and around,50
NA,"75,000 workers are injured through",50
NA,"accidents, which in most cases are",50
NA,foreseeable and avoidable and which can be,50
NA,attributed to cost cutting. Yet people like Ark,50
NA,Tribe were taken to court for standing up for,50
NA,their right to a safe work environment.,50
NA,"In food production, farm producers are",50
NA,squeezed for lower prices by the major,50
NA,grocery retailers in turn placing hardship and,50
NA,stress on farming families. The current milk,50
NA,price war has been linked to the executive,50
NA,remuneration of the Coles CEO with,50
NA,allegations that the Coles CEO will be paid,50
NA,millions of dollars if he increases the Coles,50
NA,profit. Discounting milk is a strategy,50
NA,currently being employed by Coles to,50
NA,increase market share of grocery sales and,50
NA,ultimately the Coles profit. The Australian,50
NA,dairy farmers say the discounted milk is,50
NA,already reducing the income of dairy farmers,50
NA,and threatens their ongoing viability. This is,50
NA,a claim that Coles is disputing of course. We,50
NA,have also seen farm products being sourced,50
NA,from overseas where production standards do,50
NA,"not meet Australian standards, which in turn",50
NA,leads to health impacts on Australian,50
NA,consumers and a demise of Australian food,50
NA,production. Again these are decisions made,50
NA,by executives whose primary interest is,50
NA,profit. The impact on Australian farmers and,50
NA,the health impacts on Australian consumers,50
NA,are ultimately borne by governments.,50
NA,Another of the very concerning trends in,50
NA,recent times has been the use of overseas,50
NA,registered shipping and crews. We have now,50
NA,had several cases of extensive environmental,50
NA,disasters that have been attributed to cost-,50
NA,cutting decisions made by executives who,50
NA,are driven by profit. The environmental,50
NA,disaster on the Great Barrier Reef when a,50
NA,"Chinese coal carrier ran aground, spilling",50
NA,about four tonnes of heavy fuel oil from a,50
NA,"perforated fuel tank, has been attributed to a",50
NA,"seaman being fatigued, having managed only",50
NA,2½ hours of sleep in the previous 38½ hours.,50
NA,In February this year there was another,50
NA,shipping incident. It was associated with the,50
NA,multi-cat vessel Boskalis BKM 102 whilst,50
NA,working on the Gorgon project off Barrow,50
NA,Island. The four MUA crew members were,50
NA,put at risk and the pristine environment was,50
NA,"badly polluted, because of the shoddy",50
NA,practices of the overseas shipping company.,50
NA,"In addition, there was the Montara oil spill,",50
NA,which occurred in the Timor Sea on 21,50
NA,August 2009 and continued right up until,50
NA,November 2009. I understand that Indonesia,50
NA,and East Timor are now seeking,50
NA,compensation for the,51
NA,environmental damage done. Even if they are,51
NA,successful as to compensation and even if,51
NA,"penalties are imposed, the reality is that the",51
NA,bulk of the environmental damage cost,51
NA,inevitably will fall onto governments and,51
NA,society.,51
NA,The measures in this bill provide,51
NA,increased accountability by CEOs to,51
NA,shareholders and conversely,51
NA,shareholders more control over executive,51
NA,"remuneration, and they will be welcomed by",51
NA,many Australians. It is my view that most,51
NA,shareholders do not endorse the kinds of,51
NA,practices that I have alluded to in my,51
NA,remarks. It is my view that most,51
NA,shareholders want to see their executives,51
NA,acting responsibly. Time will enable us to,51
NA,determine whether the measures in this bill,51
NA,are sufficient to ensure the right level of,51
NA,accountability by CEOs. It is my view that,51
NA,many CEOs are still,51
NA,overremunerated and I would consider,51
NA,supporting additional measures that I believe,51
NA,could be taken to curb excessive CEO,51
NA,remuneration packages. I note the comments,51
NA,of members opposite and I understand that,51
NA,they intend moving an amendment. I also,51
NA,note comments they believe that essentially,51
NA,the government should not meddle in private,51
NA,enterprise. These comments were made by a,51
NA,number of these speakers. I reject that,51
NA,proposition. I believe that this legislation is a,51
NA,"step in the right direction, and I commend it",51
NA,to the House.,51
NA,Debate adjourned.,51
NA,Midwife Professional Indemnity,51
NA,Legislation Amendment Bill 2011,51
NA,Second Reading,51
NA,Debate resumed on the motion:,51
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,51
Mr DUTTON ,Dickson) (11:12): Yet,51
NA,again the fact that the Midwife Professional,51
NA,extensive Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2011,51
NA,is before the House today is proof that this,51
NA,government just cannot get anything right.,51
NA,The bill is yet another fix from Gillard Labor,51
NA,to legislation that it rushed into this,51
NA,parliament two years ago. It has been,51
NA,struggling to get it right ever since. Members,51
NA,will recall the troubled passage of the,51
NA,midwives and nurse practitioners bill and the,51
NA,give midwife and professional indemnity bills,51
NA,throughout 2009 and 2010. The Minister for,51
NA,Health and Ageing tried to blame the,51
NA,opposition. She then tried to blame the,51
NA,Senate-anybody but herself-for the delays,51
NA,in this legislation passing through this,51
NA,"parliament. In fact, it was a case of the",51
NA,minister and the government rushing,51
NA,headlong to get the legislation into the,51
NA,parliament without taking the time to ensure,51
NA,"that they had got it right. In the end, it was",51
NA,the government that was introducing,51
NA,grossly amendments to its own legislation as it,51
NA,moved through the parliament. Through the,51
NA,process Minister Roxon had to admit that she,51
NA,"had got it wrong, and she had to backtrack.",51
NA,"She had to placate concerned stakeholders,",51
NA,she had to clarify matters to a Senate,51
NA,committee and then the minister had to make,51
NA,"amendments. Then, after the legislation had",51
NA,"taken effect from July last year, the minister",51
NA,was forced to make new rules to cover the,51
NA,problems that this bill now seeks to remedy.,51
NA,And what were those problems?,51
NA,The answer to this is that the minister had,51
NA,bungled things yet again. Perhaps we should,51
NA,"say 'as usual', because if we look back over",51
NA,the last 3½ years it certainly has been a,51
NA,litany of failure and inability to deliver even,51
NA,"the most basic of legislative programs, and",51
NA,this is a reflection on the broader dilemma,51
NA,that the government face: the public now,51
NA,realises that this is a government that just,51
NA,cannot deliver on what it is that they,51
NA,propose.,51
NA,The drafting of the original legislation,52
NA,actually excluded one group of midwives,52
NA,from accessing the indemnity contribution,52
NA,scheme. The legislation treated those who,52
NA,operated through their own companies and,52
NA,were in fact self-employed the same as it,52
NA,treated those who were employed by larger,52
NA,"organisations, such as hospitals or medical",52
NA,"practices, and therefore as employed",52
NA,midwives. The legislation had excluded,52
NA,employed midwives from the scheme. The,52
NA,government presents this as an oversight. It,52
NA,"was 'not the government's original intention',",52
NA,they say. And this bill to remedy the,52
NA,situation is presented as a technical fix for,52
NA,minor element of the act. What it is though is,52
NA,another error on the part of the government,52
NA,"and of this minister. So, too, is the second",52
NA,matter this bill seeks to remedy. That,52
NA,mistake is presented as a 'typographical,52
NA,error'. Let me just explain what the,52
NA,typographical error goes to. What effectively,52
NA,the original legislation did was to enshrine,52
NA,law a formula to tax insurers of midwives at,52
NA,a rate far higher than the premium income,52
NA,those insurers received from the midwives,52
NA,for their insurance coverage. That is some,52
NA,typo! It is also typical of a government that,52
NA,continually talks about grandiose schemes,52
NA,and ambitions but then completely fails to do,52
NA,the hard yards to get the detail right.,52
NA,Exclude for the moment the monumental,52
NA,failures of the Rudd and Gillard governments,52
NA,with pink batts and school halls and green,52
NA,schemes. We have seen the failure to deliver,52
NA,time and time again in the area of health.,52
NA,"Remember, for a start, the all-encompassing",52
NA,promise from Kevin Rudd to fix public,52
NA,"hospitals: he was going to do it, remember,",52
NA,by mid-2009 and if he had not he was going,52
NA,to hold a referendum for the Commonwealth,52
NA,takeover of the nation's public hospitals. All,52
NA,we had by mid-2009 was a series of reports,52
NA,from the multitude of committees and,52
NA,had commissions and working groups and,52
NA,inquiries that Rudd Labor had,52
NA,commissioned. All we had by 2010 was a,52
NA,hastily thrown-together plan branded the,52
NA,national health and hospitals reform so that,52
NA,the Rudd-Gillard government could actually,52
NA,look like it was doing something to honour,52
NA,those commitments made to Australians in,52
NA,mid-2007.,52
NA,What did we get from the so-called,52
NA,reform? We certainly got lots of media,52
NA,"releases, conferences and communiques, and",52
NA,plenty of colourful and expensive booklets,52
NA,"outlining the grand health plan, some of",52
NA,a which had to be pulped within days of being,52
NA,"printed, such was the hubris surrounding Mr",52
NA,"Rudd's and Ms Roxon's health reforms. Now,",52
NA,"of course, it is a fact that Kevin Rudd was",52
NA,deposed. His historic reforms were shredded.,52
NA,Now we have the current Prime Minister,52
NA,saying 'historic health reforms'-this has a,52
NA,familiar ring to it-which amount at this,52
NA,in stage to nothing more than an agreement,52
NA,with the premiers to get an agreement. An,52
NA,agreement to get an agreement. If anything,52
NA,"sums Labor up, it is an intention to do",52
NA,something or an intention to have an,52
NA,intention to do something. An agreement to,52
NA,get an agreement-that is where this historic,52
NA,reform is as we stand in this parliament,52
NA,today. This is a government that has failed,52
NA,"the Australian public in so many areas, as I",52
NA,"have said before, but none more so in my",52
NA,view than in health.,52
NA,Let us take another example: the so-called,52
NA,GP superclinics. They are so super that they,52
NA,resemble any other general practice across,52
NA,"the country. Yet again, much was promised,",52
NA,but when we look at what is being,52
NA,delivered-we know what is being,52
NA,delivered-we see that it is taxpayers' money,52
NA,that is going to set up a practice in opposition,52
NA,to a practice which has been established,52
NA,through private investment. It is completely,53
NA,"offensive, not just to the doctors and nurses",53
NA,who are involved but to patients as well. To,53
NA,"make it worse, the government have decided",53
NA,that they will proffer preferential treatment,53
NA,"in terms of the employment of the doctors,",53
NA,and presumably nurses in some cases as,53
NA,"well, at these superclinics, which puts them",53
NA,at a competitive advantage to those practices,53
NA,which operate with the cost of capital being,53
NA,deployed into these centres. It is untenable,53
NA,that this situation continues. Ms Roxon had,53
NA,promised more than 60 of these so-called,53
NA,"superclinics, and we know that just 10 of",53
NA,these clinics have opened across the country,53
NA,"five years after they were promised, and",53
NA,completely and utterly over budget. Nothing,53
NA,this government touch does anything but turn,53
NA,to dust. The health portfolio contains one,53
NA,classic example after another of why Labor,53
NA,just cannot be trusted with the sort of,53
NA,"legislation that is before the House today or,",53
NA,"indeed, the general health program.",53
NA,Last night we saw the government make,53
NA,an announcement on mental health-an area,53
NA,of great importance to all Australians-that,53
NA,they tried to make people believe was in the,53
NA,order of $2.2 billion. But when you strip,53
NA,"away that spin, the Australian public has",53
NA,discovered today that the government,53
NA,commits $583 million over the next four,53
NA,"years, over the forward estimates. They have",53
NA,"some money in the fifth year. But, strangely",53
NA,"enough, five years time will be the third year",53
NA,"of the next term of government. So, if you",53
NA,believe that Julia Gillard is going to last,53
NA,"next two years, she then has to last the next",53
NA,three years beyond that as Prime Minister to,53
NA,implement this plan that was announced last,53
NA,night. It is complete and utter fantasy.,53
NA,This is a government that promises big. It,53
NA,"promised big to the midwives, it promised",53
NA,"big to the mental health community, but it",53
NA,has delivered nothing. This is a government,53
NA,that should hang its head in shame when it,53
NA,"comes to the health portfolio because, whilst",53
NA,billions and billions of dollars has been,53
NA,"squandered in pink batts, in all of these failed",53
NA,programs that the Labor government has,53
NA,delivered-,53
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr KJ,53
NA,Thomson): Order! I am reluctant-,53
Mr DUTTON, money has not been,53
NA,"directed into these sorts of areas, which are",53
NA,incredibly important-,53
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, The shadow,53
NA,minister will resume his seat when I am,53
NA,"drawing his attention to a matter, otherwise I",53
NA,will have to sit him down. I am reluctant to,53
NA,"interrupt shadow ministers and speakers, but",53
NA,so far the shadow minister has had precious,53
NA,little to say about the bill before the House. I,53
NA,draw his attention to the fact that we are,53
NA,debating the Midwife Professional Indemnity,53
NA,Legislation Amendment Bill.,53
Mr DUTTON, What I have done in my,53
NA,speech thus far has been to demonstrate the,53
NA,"failings of Labor, particularly in relation to",53
NA,this piece of legislation before the,53
NA,parliament. It is important for people to,53
NA,understand that this is yet another patch-up,53
NA,job by a government that just cannot get it,53
NA,"right. I think it is completely reasonable, in",53
NA,drawing people's attention to the latest,53
NA,"failings, this time in health, that we also",53
NA,"draw their attention to Labor's other failings,",53
NA,because it gives people an understanding of,53
NA,the modus operandi of this government.,53
NA,They cannot get it right in the area of pink,53
NA,the batts; they cannot give pink batts away for,53
NA,free. They cannot get the midwives,53
NA,legislation right.,53
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, I have told,53
NA,the shadow minister that he needs to be,53
NA,relevant to the bill. If he wishes to defy my,53
NA,"ruling, I will sit him down and move to the",53
NA,next speaker.,53
Mr DUTTON, Why this is completely,53
NA,relevant is because it shows a course of,53
NA,conduct by a government that is out of,54
NA,control. The point is that it is not just,54
NA,restricted to the area of health. More money,54
NA,is needed in the area for doctors and nurses,54
NA,"and for midwives in particular, but this is a",54
NA,government that has wasted money and this,54
NA,is a government that has said to the,54
NA,Australian public that it has health as a,54
NA,"priority, yet every act both inside this",54
NA,portfolio and across broader government,54
NA,points to completely the opposite. I think it is,54
NA,"a crying shame for Australian patients, for",54
NA,midwives who are affected directly by this,54
NA,"bill, for all allied health professionals, that",54
NA,they see so much promised and yet have so,54
NA,little delivered. This is just the latest example,54
NA,of why this government cannot be trusted,54
NA,going forward. The midwives of Australia,54
NA,look at this piece of legislation as yet the,54
NA,latest example of why this government,54
NA,cannot be trusted into the future.,54
NA,We supported the original tranche of,54
NA,legislation in this area. We provided,54
NA,constructive input to the government. We,54
NA,warned them of some of the likely failings.,54
NA,Some of those failings have come to pass.,54
NA,They talk about typographical errors which,54
NA,in effect make the premium completely,54
NA,above and beyond what anybody could be,54
NA,expected to pay. Nobody could practise as a,54
NA,result of this legislation reasonably if they,54
NA,were in certain employment circumstances.,54
NA,"As I say, we flagged the fact that this",54
NA,government would get yet another bill,54
NA,wrong. They did not let us down. Certainly,54
NA,they have let the Australian people down.,54
NA,We support the amendments because they,54
NA,"make bad legislation better than it was, but",54
NA,ultimately what needs to be highlighted to,54
NA,this parliament and to the Australian people,54
NA,is that this is yet the latest example of a,54
NA,"government that has failed at every turn, for",54
NA,which they should be condemned at the,54
NA,ballot box in two years time.,54
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (11:24): I rise to,54
NA,speak in support of the Midwife Professional,54
NA,Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill,54
NA,2011. The member for Dickson urged us to,54
NA,"put more money into hospitals, doctors,",54
NA,nurses and the health system generally. This,54
NA,"is a bit rich coming from those opposite,",54
NA,when the Institute of Health and Welfare in,54
NA,October 2007 produced a damning report on,54
NA,the state of the health and hospital system in,54
NA,this country under the tutelage of the then,54
NA,"minister, who happens to be the opposition",54
NA,"leader, and he was a longstanding health",54
NA,minister at that time. The institute damned,54
NA,"the Howard coalition government, saying",54
NA,"that they had actually defunded, vis-a-vis the",54
NA,states and territories and the private health,54
NA,"sector, health and hospital funding in this",54
NA,country. Even the now opposition leader-,54
NA,and we have had about three of them since,54
NA,2007-at that time actually admitted during,54
NA,a campaign that was not one of his best and,54
NA,finest performances in terms of timeliness,54
NA,"and preparedness to debate issues,",54
NA,particularly with the now Minister for,54
NA,Health-,54
Mr Baldwin," Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise",54
NA,a point of order. I am mindful of how you,54
NA,brought the member for Dickson to order to,54
NA,address the bill. I would suggest that you,54
NA,bring your attention to ask the current,54
NA,speaker to address the actual issues in the,54
NA,bill.,54
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, The member,54
NA,for Paterson will be aware that the member,54
NA,for Dickson spoke for about 10 minutes,54
NA,before I drew his attention to the bill. But the,54
NA,member for Blair no doubt is aware of the,54
NA,contents of the bill and I ask him to draw his,54
NA,remarks to the bill.,54
Mr NEUMANN," I am happy to do so,",54
NA,Mr Deputy Speaker. I will just respond on,54
NA,"one issue, and that is the GP superclinics. I",54
NA,say to the member for Dickson that the GP,55
NA,"superclinic in Ipswich, which I am proud to",55
NA,have supported and sought the funding for at,55
NA,"$2.5 million, was a wonderful institution for",55
NA,the Ipswich community at the time of the,55
NA,"floods, being situated next to the main",55
NA,evacuation centre in Ipswich at the,55
NA,showground. If the member for Dickson,55
NA,wants to go and have a look at the Ipswich,55
NA,GP superclinic he is most welcome to at,55
NA,some stage. It is operating now under the,55
NA,great leadership of Dr Simon Barnett.,55
NA,I want to speak about what the coalition,55
NA,government failed to do with respect to,55
NA,midwifery and what we are doing in this,55
NA,legislation and what we have done since we,55
NA,were elected. The role of midwives and the,55
NA,issue of health funding and also insurance,55
NA,became very obvious back in about 2002 and,55
NA,also prior to that with the collapse of the,55
NA,insurance market after 9/11. There was a,55
NA,landmark obstetrics birth injury case which,55
NA,resulted in a payout of about $11 million and,55
NA,that initiated a crisis of confidence in the,55
NA,industry and also with respect to midwives,55
NA,across the country. With about 200 privately,55
NA,practising midwives paying about $800 a,55
NA,"year for insurance, there simply was not a",55
NA,big enough pool of funds to contemplate a,55
NA,"payout of that magnitude, and obviously",55
NA,insurance for midwives was a big issue.,55
NA,The coalition was in power in 2001-06,55
NA,"and most of 2007, so it had over six years to",55
NA,"resolve this issue. Surprisingly, it did",55
NA,was too hard for those opposite-inaction,55
NA,and inactivity on the issue was their motto.,55
NA,They were simply spending too much time,55
NA,attacking workers and not enough time,55
NA,noticing what was happening in the midwife,55
NA,sector. Since we got into power we took,55
NA,steps to find out about the issues facing,55
NA,midwives across the nation. In 2008 we,55
NA,directed the Commonwealth Chief Nurse and,55
NA,"Midwifery Officer, Rosemary Bryant, to",55
NA,conduct a review of midwifery services in,55
NA,Australia. In addition a number of my,55
NA,colleagues and I lobbied very hard on this,55
NA,issue. I met with midwives in Queensland,55
NA,and I spoke at fora put on by the Maternity,55
NA,Coalition in the state. I spoke to a number of,55
NA,"people in the industry, including a very",55
NA,"prominent midwife in the Ipswich area,",55
NA,Teresa Walsh. I wish her and the other,55
NA,midwives well in their venture in relation to,55
NA,maternity services and midwifery services in,55
NA,"Ipswich, Toowoomba and the western",55
NA,corridor and the business they are currently,55
NA,conducting. I had the privilege of serving on,55
NA,the local health community council with Cas,55
NA,"MCCullough, a real mover and shaker in the",55
NA,Maternity Coalition in Queensland and,55
NA,someone who has argued strongly for reform,55
NA,for midwives. Cas has taken a very strong,55
NA,view that we need to make changes to,55
NA,support midwives and has certainly put into,55
NA,practice her commitment to caring for young,55
NA,children and for women who choose,55
NA,"homebirths, as well as for women who",55
NA,choose to give birth in other ways. Cas's,55
NA,work is very well known in the West,55
NA,"Moreton area, and I commend her for the",55
NA,work she is doing.,55
NA,It was Labor that brought three bills,55
NA,before this House in 2009 to support,55
NA,Australia's midwives. Despite the great work,55
NA,"done there, anomalies emerged from that",55
NA,legislation. The purpose of the Midwife,55
NA,Professional Indemnity (Commonwealth,55
NA,not. It Contribution) Scheme Act 2010 and the,55
NA,associated Midwife Professional Indemnity,55
NA,(Run-off Cover Support Payment) Act 2010,55
NA,was to support the new MBS and PBS,55
NA,arrangements by enabling the establishment,55
NA,of a government supported professional,55
NA,indemnity scheme for eligible midwives,55
NA,from 1 July 2010. An unintended,55
NA,consequence emerged from the enactment of,55
NA,the contribution scheme legislation whereby,55
NA,midwives who were self-employed and had,55
NA,formed companies through which to operate,55
NA,their services were not eligible for a,56
NA,Commonwealth contribution. That particular,56
NA,provision was set up to deal with private,56
NA,hospitals and large private obstetric practices,56
NA,as employers and was not intended to impact,56
NA,on companies established by a single,56
NA,midwife or a couple of midwives who were,56
NA,"directors, shareholders and employees of that",56
NA,private company.,56
NA,Within large companies such as private,56
NA,"hospitals and large obstetric practices, claims",56
NA,to a Commonwealth contribution scheme,56
NA,could be made by the employer. But if the,56
NA,"midwife, who may be the sole director and",56
NA,"sole shareholder, was also an employee, this",56
NA,made them ineligible to make a contribution,56
NA,"claim, and that was never the federal Labor",56
NA,government's intention. The Midwife,56
NA,Professional Indemnity Legislation,56
NA,Amendment Bill 2011 has the very important,56
NA,task of tidying up the Midwife Professional,56
NA,Indemnity Scheme created under the 2010,56
NA,legislation. The bill before the chamber,56
NA,allows for a rule-making power to be,56
NA,"established under section 11(3)(g), and thus",56
NA,tidies up the placement of the unintended,56
NA,words to a more appropriate part of the,56
NA,legislation. It also allows for future rules,56
NA,be made as and when new and innovative,56
NA,midwife self-employment arrangements,56
NA,"occur, without the need to seek a separate",56
NA,amendment to the legislation.,56
NA,"Of course, any new rules are subject to the",56
NA,scrutiny of the parliament to make sure the,56
NA,intention is consistent with the scheme,56
NA,legislation. As the member for Dickson,56
NA,"pointed out, the bill does fix an error in the",56
NA,Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off,56
NA,"Cover Support Payment) Bill 2010, which",56
NA,"became legislation, which would, if left",56
NA,"unchanged, impose a higher than intended",56
NA,tax on insurers of eligible midwives.,56
NA,This bill ensures that self-employed,56
NA,midwives can access the Commonwealth,56
NA,contribution scheme and amends the,56
NA,professional indemnity legislation of 2010 to,56
NA,ensure that the tax on insurers of eligible,56
NA,midwives is correctly calculated. These,56
NA,changes are important because self-,56
NA,"employed midwives such as Teresa Walsh,",56
NA,"whom I mentioned before, need to make sure",56
NA,that they can get access to that scheme and,56
NA,not fall foul of the previous provisions. We,56
NA,do not want them excluded from the,56
NA,operation of the provision.,56
NA,Today we see the federal Labor,56
NA,government putting the health and wellbeing,56
NA,of Australians at the forefront of legislation,56
NA,"in fixing up this problem. We saw health,",56
NA,"education, infrastructure and many aspects of",56
NA,the Australian economy front and centre in,56
NA,the Treasurer's speech last night with respect,56
NA,to employment and participation. We need to,56
NA,make sure that midwives participate not just,56
NA,in the economy but in the lives of women,56
NA,who choose to use midwives in the birthing,56
NA,of their children. This is an important,56
NA,difference in terms of legislation. It fixes up,56
NA,some problems and puts the scheme in a,56
NA,to better state. It makes sure that midwives,56
NA,have security and certainty and have access,56
NA,"to the contribution, and it helps midwives",56
NA,"such as Teresa Walsh in my electorate, and",56
NA,"others, to access the scheme in the way that",56
NA,"we always intended. For that reason, I",56
NA,commend the legislation to the House.,56
Mr LYONS ,Bass) (11:34): I rise to,56
NA,speak in the House about the Midwives,56
NA,Professional Indemnity Legislation,56
NA,Amendment Bill 2011. Most people who,56
NA,provide professional services and advice to,56
NA,the general public take out a form of,56
NA,insurance that covers and protects them and,56
NA,their clients against adverse incidents that,56
NA,may lead to injury or some kind of financial,56
NA,"loss. Civil engineers, for example, take out",57
NA,professional indemnity cover against the,57
NA,possibility that structures they build will,57
NA,become unsafe or may cause injury to,57
NA,people. Doctors take out medical indemnity,57
NA,cover against the possibility that they may,57
NA,injure their patients during the course of a,57
NA,medical procedure or as a result of a,57
NA,prescribed course of treatment.,57
NA,"In the 2009-10 budget, the government",57
NA,announced the 'improving maternity services,57
NA,package'. The package provides for the,57
NA,introduction of Medicare supported services,57
NA,to provide greater choice for women during,57
NA,"pregnancy, birthing and postnatal maternity",57
NA,"care, including the provision of professional",57
NA,indemnity for midwives. The Midwife,57
NA,"Professional Indemnity Scheme, which",57
NA,"commenced on 1 July 2010, enabled a",57
NA,Commonwealth contribution to be paid to,57
NA,insurers for the cost of eligible claims against,57
NA,eligible midwives. This act provides that the,57
NA,Commonwealth contribution and the run-off,57
NA,cover for Commonwealth contribution are,57
NA,not payable for a claim that should be,57
NA,covered by the midwife's employer. This is,57
NA,to ensure that there is no intentional cost-,57
NA,shifting from the employer to the,57
NA,Commonwealth.,57
NA,"Following the passage of this legislation,",57
NA,it was brought to the government's attention,57
NA,that the operation of this provision,57
NA,effectively excluded self-employed,57
NA,midwives. This exclusion was not the,57
NA,government's policy intention. The member,57
NA,"for Dickson, a born-to-ruler from the other",57
NA,"side, did not raise this oversight during the",57
NA,"passage of the original legislation, even",57
NA,though the opposition would have us believe,57
NA,that they have some divine right to,57
NA,knowledge and ability. To give a little,57
NA,"background on this issue, before the",57
NA,enactment of the Midwife Professional,57
NA,Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution),57
NA,"Scheme Act 2010, midwives were generally",57
NA,unable to obtain insurance to cover their,57
NA,practice. In order to protect their personal,57
NA,"assets in case of a negligence suit, many",57
NA,"midwives chose to set up a company, either",57
NA,"alone or with other midwives, through which",57
NA,they operated. This meant that any legal,57
NA,actions taken were taken against the,57
NA,"company, not the midwife personally.",57
NA,This bill also amends the Midwife,57
NA,Professional Indemnity (Run-Off Cover,57
NA,Support Payment) Act 2010 to ensure that,57
NA,the tax on insurers of eligible midwives is,57
NA,correctly calculated.,57
NA,This bill amends the Midwife Professional,57
NA,Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution),57
NA,Scheme Act 2010 to ensure that self-,57
NA,employed midwives can access the,57
NA,"Commonwealth contribution. Essentially,",57
NA,this bill tidies up minor technical errors by,57
NA,placing the intended words in a more,57
NA,appropriate section of the act and corrects a,57
NA,typographical error.,57
NA,This bill is an important component of the,57
NA,government's maternity reform package. The,57
NA,package aims to improve the choices that are,57
NA,available to women in relation to maternity,57
NA,care. The total cost over four years of the,57
NA,professional indemnity for midwives,57
NA,component of the package is $25.2 million. I,57
NA,commend these changes to the House.,57
NA,Women and their babies must be the focus,57
NA,of maternity care. They should be able to feel,57
NA,they are in control of what is happening,57
NA,"during pregnancy, childbirth and the",57
NA,"postnatal period, based on their individual",57
NA,needs and having discussed the issues fully,57
NA,with their care providers. Australian women,57
NA,and their babies should be able to access,57
NA,"high-quality, safe maternity services.",57
NA,This government has a proud record of,57
NA,delivering better health services for all,57
NA,Australians. Helping Australia's hospital,57
NA,system to recover from the dark days of the,57
NA,Howard-Abbott years was a daunting task,57
NA,for Labor when we came to office in 2007.,58
NA,In 2008 we boosted hospital funding by $20,58
NA,"billion, a 50 per cent increase. We have also",58
NA,invested over $2.4 billion in health,58
NA,workforce measures. That is helping us to,58
NA,"train over 1,000 nurses each year and double",58
NA,"the number of GPs in training, and we have",58
NA,seen the Commonwealth's specialist training,58
NA,"program expand from just 51, when Mr",58
NA,"Abbott was the health minister, to 518 this",58
NA,"year. Plus, we have made a record $872.1",58
NA,million investment in preventative health.,58
NA,And just last night we announced measures,58
NA,to assist those with a mental illness.,58
NA,The government is delivering major,58
NA,reforms across the health system to improve,58
NA,"the quality of services, responsiveness at a",58
NA,local level and access to care. We are,58
NA,governing for Australia's future. We are,58
NA,supporting Australian families. This is a,58
NA,small but important amendment. I,58
NA,"congratulate those opposite, as they do",58
NA,support this amendment because it promotes,58
NA,choice and protects our valuable midwives.,58
Mr CIOBO ,Moncrieff) (11:40): I rise to,58
NA,the speak to the Midwife Professional,58
NA,Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill,58
NA,"2011, an important bill because it goes",58
NA,towards providing greater certainty and,58
NA,assurance to those midwives who are,58
NA,"employed in their own businesses, in",58
NA,"particular, following a series of changes",58
NA,were made in the Midwife Professional,58
NA,Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution),58
NA,Scheme Act 2010.,58
NA,"Under this bill, which is relatively",58
NA,"technical in nature, there have been changes",58
NA,made to ensure that self-employed midwives,58
NA,are able to access the Midwife Professional,58
NA,Indemnity Scheme. The bill also amends the,58
NA,Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-Off,58
NA,Cover Support Payment) Act 2010 to ensure,58
NA,that the tax on insurers of eligible midwives,58
NA,"is correctly calculated, after there was a",58
NA,typographical error in the act that imposed a,58
NA,much higher tax on the premium income of,58
NA,insurers of midwives.,58
NA,The situation that arose was that the tax,58
NA,payable exceeded the premium that was,58
NA,"going to be charged. We are informed, as",58
NA,"members of the opposition, that this was an",58
NA,unintentional consequence of a typographical,58
NA,error within the act. To the extent that this,58
NA,bill clarifies the intent of the original,58
NA,legislation and provides the assurance that is,58
NA,"sought, the coalition is certainly supportive",58
NA,"of it, as am I, as a member of the coalition.",58
NA,The role of midwives is crucial. My wife,58
NA,and I had the opportunity and indeed the,58
NA,great joy of having a child a little over two,58
NA,"years ago now. There is no doubt that, for",58
NA,"many women, midwives are a source of solid",58
NA,"support, reassurance and knowledge when",58
NA,they take the journey of childbirth. The,58
NA,government should do anything it can to,58
NA,make it easier for women to practise the art,58
NA,of midwifery without the risk of there being,58
NA,a successful lawsuit hanging over their head,58
NA,for practices that are not negligent or,58
NA,reckless.,58
NA,We know that in past years there has been,58
NA,a massive increase in the number of tort,58
NA,"actions against, amongst others, midwives.",58
NA,"We have seen the repercussions, with there",58
NA,that being a large decrease in the number of,58
NA,midwives seeking to practise and changes in,58
NA,the structures that midwives adopt as,58
NA,"employees, self-employed members of the",58
NA,community and indeed small business,58
NA,"operators and proprietors, as they may well",58
NA,be.,58
NA,This bill before the House today provides,58
NA,certainty. It delivers on the policy intent of,58
NA,making sure that there is support for them to,58
NA,"undertake their practices, given their",58
NA,importance in the community and making,58
NA,sure that we as a society recognise that,59
NA,women seek support when they go through,59
NA,the process of childbirth and in the many,59
NA,months leading up to it.,59
NA,"As a husband, there was reassurance for",59
NA,me too to know that there was perhaps an,59
NA,alternative source of information that my,59
NA,wife could turn to beyond my mother-in-law,59
NA,"or sisters. I was just grateful, frankly,",59
NA,"wasn't me. In that vein, I think that we",59
NA,should be doing all that we can to make sure,59
NA,that the fine and delicate art of being a,59
NA,midwife is kept alive for as long as possible.,59
NA,"It seems to me that, if anything should be",59
NA,"labelled 'secret women's business', perhaps",59
NA,this should be. But then again that might just,59
NA,"be an old-fashioned Steve Ciobo talking,",59
NA,rather than someone who is necessarily the,59
NA,most up-to-date-,59
NA,NA,59
Mr CIOBO," snag. Having said all that,",59
NA,there remain some matters of interest for me,59
NA,that I have looked into with respect to,59
NA,midwifery for some of my constituents and,59
NA,"which still to some extent remain unresolved,",59
NA,and they are around the issue of home births.,59
NA,We know that for many individuals the,59
NA,location they choose for having their child is,59
NA,a very personal choice. It might be in a,59
NA,"hospital, but there are a number of women, I",59
NA,"recognise, who hold the fundamental view",59
NA,that childbirth is a very natural thing-not,59
NA,something that requires,59
NA,intervention-and they often choose to have,59
NA,"their child in the familiar, comfortable",59
NA,surroundings of their home. For those,59
NA,midwives who practice their art or their skills,59
NA,"in people's homes, there is still, I am told by",59
NA,"those in that industry, some uncertainty",59
NA,about their legal liabilities and their level of,59
NA,protection for homebirths. Although this act,59
NA,"does not go directly to that matter, it is",59
NA,important to recognise that there are very,59
NA,active and vocal groups in many,59
NA,"communities, not just in my own, who hold",59
NA,the view that we should be doing more to,59
NA,facilitate things for those women who would,59
NA,like to be midwives and for those women,59
NA,who would like to give birth in their own,59
NA,homes.,59
NA,So I just put on the record my support for,59
NA,those who choose to go down that path. It,59
NA,that it was not the pathway that my wife and I,59
NA,"chose to go down. Notwithstanding that, I",59
NA,"recognise it as a personal choice, a choice",59
NA,"that many women make. Again, in that",59
NA,"sense, I think policy should be directed",59
NA,"towards assisting them, recognising, though,",59
NA,what for me was an inescapable fact-that,59
NA,"there is, I believe, an elevated risk as a result",59
NA,of homebirths. That elevated risk,59
NA,"notwithstanding, the reality is that there is of",59
NA,course no aspect of life that is without risk,59
NA,and I recognise the rights of those who,59
NA,choose to have their child in their own home.,59
NA,I am certainly pleased to support the bill,59
NA,before the House today. I recognise that it,59
NA,comes as a consequence of a typographical,59
NA,"error. You would have thought, perhaps, that",59
NA,with so many eyes in the executive checking,59
NA,"this legislation, and with so many others",59
NA,"checking it, these kinds of errors would not",59
NA,"take place. That notwithstanding, it has taken",59
NA,"place, but it is being corrected and the",59
NA,opposition supports that. I commend the bill,59
NA,to the House.,59
NA,Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell),59
NA,(11:51): I rise to support this piece of,59
NA,important legislation. The purpose of the,59
NA,Midwife Professional Indemnity,59
NA,(Commonwealth Contribution) Scheme Act,59
NA,2010 and the associated Midwife,59
NA,Professional Indemnity (Run-off Cover,59
NA,Support Payment) Act 2011 was to support,59
NA,the new MBS and PBS arrangements by,59
NA,enabling the establishment of a government,59
NA,supported professional indemnity scheme for,59
NA,eligible midwives from 1 July last year.,59
NA,Those acts removed a longstanding barrier to,60
NA,appropriately qualified and experienced,60
NA,midwives wishing to provide high-quality,60
NA,midwifery services to Australian women as,60
NA,part of a collaborative team with doctors and,60
NA,other health professionals.,60
NA,The Midwife Professional Indemnity,60
NA,(Commonwealth Contribution Scheme) Act,60
NA,2010 currently excludes employed midwives,60
NA,from accessing a Commonwealth,60
NA,contribution and a run-off,60
NA,Commonwealth contribution. This exclusion,60
NA,is to ensure that there is no intentional,60
NA,shifting from employers of midwives to the,60
NA,Commonwealth. The bill tidies up the act by,60
NA,placing the rule-making powers in a more,60
NA,appropriate section and thus ensures that,60
NA,eligible self-employed midwives are not,60
NA,excluded from access to Commonwealth,60
NA,contributions for claims that are made while,60
NA,they are in the workforce or for any claims,60
NA,that are made after they retire. By doing,60
NA,the act will continue to exclude other,60
NA,"employed midwives, such as those employed",60
NA,"by private hospitals, to prevent the cost-",60
NA,shifting-already referred to-from that,60
NA,sector to the Commonwealth by employers.,60
NA,The changes to the act proposed by this,60
NA,bill will also allow a specific rule-making,60
NA,power to appropriately address any new and,60
NA,innovative midwife self-employment models,60
NA,that may arise in the future. This was an,60
NA,issue of particular concern to midwives when,60
NA,the previous bills were before the parliament.,60
NA,This rule-making power will ensure the bill,60
NA,will be able to accurately describe midwives,60
NA,and employment arrangements which are,60
NA,within the scope of the government's,60
NA,maternity reform policy.,60
NA,The bill also corrects a typographical error,60
NA,in the Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-,60
NA,Off Cover Support Payment) Act 2010,60
NA,"which would, if left unchanged, impose a",60
NA,higher than intended tax on insurers of,60
NA,eligible midwives. The Australian,60
NA,government is proud to be implementing,60
NA,historic reforms to maternity care which,60
NA,recognise the skills of our highly trained,60
NA,midwives and provide more choice for,60
NA,Australian women while maintaining,60
NA,"Australia's strong record of high-quality, safe",60
NA,maternity services.,60
NA,I will spend a little bit of time looking at,60
NA,cover the background to these reforms. Improving,60
NA,maternity services in Australia: the report of,60
NA,costthe Maternity Services Review highlighted,60
NA,"the complex nature of maternity services,",60
NA,"which involve a mix of Commonwealth,",60
NA,"state, territory and private arrangements. The",60
NA,report was developed following consultation,60
NA,with a broad range of stakeholders including,60
NA,"individuals, health professionals, industry",60
NA,"groups, researchers, professional",60
NA,organisations and national peak bodies. The,60
NA,"this, report made a number of recommendations",60
NA,which focused on the need to improve,60
NA,maternal and peri-natal outcomes for,60
NA,"Indigenous and rural Australians, improve",60
NA,"choices available for pregnant women,",60
NA,increase access to high-quality maternity,60
NA,services and provide support for the,60
NA,maternity services workforce.,60
NA,The government responded to the report,60
NA,with a $120.5 million package to provide,60
NA,access for midwives to the Medicare,60
NA,Benefits Schedule and to Pharmaceutical,60
NA,"Benefits Scheme medicines, and a",60
NA,government supported professional,60
NA,indemnity insurance scheme for eligible,60
NA,"midwives. On 24 June 2009, the Minister for",60
NA,Health and Ageing introduced legislation to,60
NA,facilitate these new arrangements. These,60
NA,arrangements are available for appropriately,60
NA,qualified and experienced midwives working,60
NA,in cooperation with obstetricians and health,60
NA,facilities as recommended by the report.,60
NA,These changes enable the clients of,61
NA,midwives and nurse practitioners to access,61
NA,services and medications subsidised by the,61
NA,MBS and PBS. There are currently around,61
NA,"350 qualified nurse practitioners in Australia,",61
NA,generally working in public hospitals.,61
NA,Initially about 50 nurse practitioners were,61
NA,expected to access the MBS and PBS for,61
NA,their clients in certain private and,61
NA,"community settings, particularly in primary",61
NA,"care and rural areas, from November 2010.",61
NA,For midwives to be eligible to participate,61
NA,"in the new arrangements, they needed to",61
NA,meet advanced practice requirements and to,61
NA,have had collaborative arrangements with,61
NA,doctors. These requirements,61
NA,collaborative arrangements were developed,61
NA,"in consultation with midwives, doctors and",61
NA,other stakeholders. The reform initiatives,61
NA,supported by this legislation allow for,61
NA,incremental reform within a strong,61
NA,framework of quality and safety. It is,61
NA,expected that around 700 eligible midwives,61
NA,will be participating in this measure over the,61
NA,next three years. The government,61
NA,understands the concerns in the community,61
NA,about registration and professional indemnity,61
NA,insurance and how this affects the,61
NA,involvement of midwives in homebirths. Our,61
NA,legislation has expanded Commonwealth,61
NA,support for midwives and nurse practitioners,61
NA,in our community. They improve choice and,61
NA,extend Commonwealth funding for a range,61
NA,of midwife and nurse practitioner services,61
NA,"for the first time ever, including providing",61
NA,antenatal care in the community and,61
NA,attending births in clinical settings. None of,61
NA,these bills have made homebirth unlawful.,61
NA,"However, under an agreement made last",61
NA,"year the states, territories and the",61
NA,Commonwealth agreed to a two-year,61
NA,exemption for homebirthing midwives who,61
NA,are acting not within the state hospital,61
NA,system but in the private sector. A number of,61
NA,conditions and requirements were attached to,61
NA,"that exemption, including that a",61
NA,homebirthing midwife must disclose to a,61
NA,mother who is interested in having a,61
NA,homebirth that they will not be insured for,61
NA,that procedure and making sure that people,61
NA,make an informed choice about undertaking,61
NA,a homebirth. The government asked,61
NA,homebirthing midwives to report each,61
NA,homebirth.,61
NA,There is currently not any good data,61
NA,across the country of how many homebirths,61
NA,actually occur. Independent midwives are,61
NA,not currently required to notify state and,61
NA,"territory authorities or hospitals, nor have",61
NA,"they been asked to. We will require,",61
NA,"and however, participation in quality and safety",61
NA,"frameworks-for example, reporting the",61
NA,results of homebirthing and incidents that are,61
NA,related to it.,61
NA,The government wants this work to be,61
NA,"done collaboratively, by way of a peer",61
NA,review process. The consultation process is,61
NA,being overseen by Victoria through the,61
NA,national registration and accreditation,61
NA,process. The national Nursing and,61
NA,Midwifery Board will provide advice and,61
NA,protocols for homebirthing outside the,61
NA,publicly funded and auspiced services.,61
NA,Privately practising midwives-some of,61
NA,whom currently provide homebirthing,61
NA,services but do it as part of their,61
NA,"employment, either with the state or with a",61
NA,private practising obstetrician-would not be,61
NA,affected by these changes as their insurance,61
NA,is already covered through their employment,61
NA,status. Clearly this arrangement will not,61
NA,apply in jurisdictions where no lawful,61
NA,homebirthing is occurring.,61
NA,The two-year exemption allows plenty,61
NA,more time for those protocols to be,61
NA,established and to be worked on. In the,61
NA,"meantime, the arrangements ensure that",61
NA,homebirthing midwives can lawfully,61
NA,continue to provide the services in the,61
NA,jurisdictions currently allowed. They will,62
NA,continue to be uninsured-as they are,62
NA,currently. The government is collecting more,62
NA,data on homebirthing and there will be a,62
NA,process to further work through these,62
NA,protocols that would either bring more,62
NA,homebirthing services into the public system,62
NA,or potentially open the way in the future for,62
NA,an insurance product to be extended to cover,62
NA,them.,62
NA,Homebirthing programs operate in a,62
NA,number of state and territory systems with,62
NA,participating midwives coming under the,62
NA,insurance cover of the public health system.,62
NA,Midwives who provide maternity services in,62
NA,"an independent private capacity, including",62
NA,"assisting with homebirths, currently do so",62
NA,without indemnity cover as there are no,62
NA,products currently commercially available.,62
NA,I have met on a number of occasions with,62
NA,my local representatives of the Maternity,62
NA,"Coalition. In fact, I first attended a meeting",62
NA,in my electorate of Dobell on the Central,62
NA,Coast some three years ago where these,62
NA,concerns were raised. They are legitimate,62
NA,concerns about making sure,62
NA,homebirthing is there as a choice for women.,62
NA,While homebirthing has been very much in,62
NA,"the minority-in fact, much less than one per",62
NA,cent of pregnant women choose to give birth,62
NA,at home in Australia-it has nonetheless,62
NA,been at the forefront of innovation in relation,62
NA,to birthing. Water births and the like were,62
NA,products of homebirths. Everyone in this,62
NA,place must be a little concerned at the,62
NA,extremely high rates of caesarean operations,62
NA,"in this country-well over 30 per cent, when",62
NA,the World Health Organisation talks about,62
NA,15 per cent being around what would occur,62
NA,in most communities. On the Central Coast,62
NA,"that problem is even greater, with Gosford",62
NA,Private Hospital having caesarean rates in,62
NA,excess of 50 per cent and Gosford Public,62
NA,Hospital having caesarean rates in excess of,62
NA,40 per cent. So you can understand that,62
NA,women on the Central Coast do want to have,62
NA,options that involve midwives-so that a,62
NA,caesarean is much less likely.,62
NA,"In March 2009, the Council of Australian",62
NA,Governments signed an intergovernmental,62
NA,agreement to implement a single indemnity,62
NA,scheme which came into effect in July 2010.,62
NA,The scheme initially covered 10 health,62
NA,"professions-medicine, nursing, midwifery,",62
NA,"pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry,",62
NA,"osteopathy, chiropractic, optometry and",62
NA,"dental care including dentists, dental",62
NA,"therapists, dental hygienists and dental",62
NA,prosthetists-and psychologists. Under the,62
NA,scheme there is a requirement for,62
NA,professional indemnity insurance as a,62
NA,mandatory condition of registration for all,62
NA,"health professionals, including midwives.",62
NA,This is an important part of raising standards,62
NA,and providing public protection for patients,62
NA,and consumers. The Australian government,62
NA,is committed to building on our previous,62
NA,budget maternity services reform packages,62
NA,that by working with the states and territories and,62
NA,"with key stakeholders, to develop a national",62
NA,maternity service plan to ensure coordination,62
NA,of maternity services across Australia.,62
NA,Many members have previously spoken,62
NA,about their personal experiences in relation,62
NA,to midwifery. I would like to share with the,62
NA,"House some of mine, too. My daughter",62
NA,Matilda was born at Wyong Hospital where,62
NA,the only service is midwifery. So in some,62
NA,"areas, workforce shortages mean that choices",62
NA,for women are limited. We had a terrific,62
NA,"experience with a midwife. In fact, we are",62
NA,pregnant again and we are going back to the,62
NA,same midwife. Our experience of the,62
NA,midwifery profession was very positive. At,62
NA,"Wyong Hospital, there is a room which looks",62
NA,like any room you would have at home with,62
NA,a big bath and a bed and a midwife to guide,63
NA,you. You do not have the option of epidurals,63
NA,because there is not an obstetrician available,63
NA,at Wyong Hospital. Mothers who are at,63
NA,potential risk are automatically transferred,63
NA,Gosford Public Hospital. The group of,63
NA,mothers who have the opportunity to be,63
NA,involved with a midwife are certainly,63
NA,screened. That is very appropriate in making,63
NA,sure that we maintain safe outcomes for,63
NA,women giving birth. If developments in the,63
NA,"birth cause concern, mothers",63
NA,immediately transferred by ambulance to,63
NA,"Gosford hospital, 10 minutes down the road,",63
NA,where obstetricians and medical practitioners,63
NA,"are available. In a sense, our region provides",63
NA,a choice through necessity rather than,63
NA,through anything else. I am very much in,63
NA,favour of making sure that homebirths are an,63
NA,option because of the terrific experiences,63
NA,that many women have had on the Central,63
NA,"Coast, including my wife. This is an",63
NA,"opportunity to thank our midwife, Val",63
NA,"Paynter, who has assisted in the births of",63
NA,hundreds of babies in the 30 years that she,63
NA,has been a midwife on the Central Coast. She,63
NA,is a great midwife and we were incredibly,63
NA,lucky. She has been midwife of the year,63
NA,"twice, so we are indebted on the Central",63
NA,Coast for having someone of her experience,63
NA,there.,63
NA,This is an important issue and shows that,63
NA,we need to make sure that there are different,63
NA,models available so that women have choice,63
NA,and are given the maximum number of,63
NA,options. Not all women will choose to have,63
NA,"birth assistance from a midwife, but those",63
NA,who do should be able to have that option.,63
NA,This is important legislation that builds,63
NA,the reforms. It builds on,63
NA,recommendations made to the government,63
NA,back in 2009. This government has acted on,63
NA,those recommendations. It is important that,63
NA,"this bill is supported, and I note that the",63
NA,opposition are supporting it and that is very,63
NA,much appreciated. This is part of the ongoing,63
NA,reform to make sure that women have better,63
NA,choices and that we maintain the high quality,63
NA,and high safety standards that exist in our,63
NA,to maternity services throughout Australia. I,63
NA,commend this bill to the House.,63
Dr STONE ,Murray) (12:01): The,63
NA,Midwife Professional Indemnity Legislation,63
NA,Amendment Bill 2011 is a very important,63
NA,piece of legislation. It aims to correct two,63
NA,serious flaws in the Midwife Professional,63
NA,are Indemnity (Commonwealth Contribution),63
NA,"Scheme Act 2010. Once amended, and the",63
NA,"coalition supports this amendment, this will",63
NA,ensure self-employed midwives can access,63
NA,the insurance scheme-what an absurd,63
NA,omission that was at the time.,63
NA,The amendments also aim to fix up the,63
NA,Midwife Professional Indemnity (Run-off,63
NA,Cover Support Payment) Act 2010. The error,63
NA,in the latter act was a miscalculation which,63
NA,imposed a far higher tax on the premium,63
NA,income of insurers of midwives. The insurer,63
NA,would have paid more in tax than the entirety,63
NA,of the net premium. This has been passed off,63
NA,"by the government as a typographical error,",63
NA,but it really is another example of sloppy,63
NA,policymaking that has had enormous,63
NA,implications for the profession of midwifery.,63
NA,It is a profession that has been under strain,63
NA,and stress for generations in this country as,63
NA,the competition continues between the so-,63
NA,called rights of doctors-mostly male,63
NA,doctors-to deliver babies compared to the,63
NA,"rights of women and families to have choice,",63
NA,and to have that choice include midwives,63
NA,who are properly and appropriately insured.,63
NA,"Obviously, we the coalition support the",63
NA,on amendments to the act. We want to allow,63
NA,the self-employed midwives into the scheme,63
NA,which gives a Commonwealth contribution,63
NA,to the insurer for the cost of eligible midwife,63
NA,claims. We support the correction of the so-,63
NA,called typographical error which imposed the,63
NA,wrong tax calculation on the insurer. But,64
NA,midwives continue to wonder what this,64
NA,government has against highly qualified and,64
NA,experienced midwives being able to take out,64
NA,government supported insurance for home,64
NA,births. Particularly for many in rural and,64
NA,"regional Australia, a home birth can be not",64
NA,only a preferred way to have the joy of new,64
NA,baby come into the home but also the safest,64
NA,and best option when you are many,64
NA,kilometres away from a hospital or when the,64
NA,travelling conditions are difficult. In some,64
NA,"sort of emergency, like our recent floods, a",64
NA,lot of our women are better off by being,64
NA,assured that a home birth is an option if a,64
NA,professionally qualified woman is nearby.,64
NA,"Under this government's policy, midwives",64
NA,assisting with home births are still not able,64
NA,be insured. They have a two-year exemption,64
NA,"for insurance cover, which will run out in",64
NA,June 2012. Why can't these women come,64
NA,under this Commonwealth assisted MIGA,64
NA,scheme right now? The lack of security,64
NA,about their futures and their insurance status,64
NA,"is obviously very problematic. Meanwhile,",64
NA,the absurdity is that all midwives-whether,64
NA,they are assisting in home births or not-,64
NA,must have insurance for the anteand post-,64
NA,"natal consultations, which are invariably part",64
NA,of a home birth program. So the whole thing,64
NA,is absolutely absurd. Midwives cannot get,64
NA,"insurance for the home delivery, but they",64
NA,must have insurance for their support visits,64
NA,before and after the birth. This system can,64
NA,"make for a serious problem, obviously, if a",64
NA,midwife wants to work with a team of other,64
NA,professional midwives but they do not have,64
NA,the special insurance that is required to cover,64
NA,home births and postand pre-natal,64
NA,consultations.,64
NA,There is another very serious problem,64
NA,with this legislation and the government's,64
NA,"policy, and it again particularly affects rural",64
NA,communities. It is a fact that the,64
NA,"Commonwealth insurance program, which",64
NA,"uses the Medical Insurance Group Australia,",64
NA,will not insure midwives who are called to,64
NA,assist in fewer than 30 baby deliveries per,64
NA,year. It might be fine in metropolitan,64
NA,Australia for a midwife to give assistance in,64
NA,more than 30 deliveries a year-they may,64
NA,"assist in 30, 50 or 80 deliveries a year-but",64
NA,in regional Australia many midwives are,64
NA,very busy and fully employed in doing a,64
NA,"range of postand pre-natal support, but do",64
NA,not assist in more than 30 deliveries a year.,64
NA,Under this scheme they are not insurable,64
NA,because they do not have the magic 30,64
NA,deliveries a year that make them eligible for,64
NA,this MIGA scheme. I ask this government to,64
NA,to immediately address this problem because it,64
NA,is a serious issue for highly professional,64
NA,"midwives in rural and regional areas, who",64
NA,often have even more years of midwifery,64
NA,experience than their sisters in metropolitan,64
NA,Australia.,64
NA,Under this government's policy and the,64
NA,MIGA involvement in the insurance for,64
NA,midwives you need to have at least three,64
NA,years professional post-graduation,64
NA,experience before you are eligible to access,64
NA,the insurance scheme. That is absurd. So a,64
NA,young midwife who has just completed her,64
NA,"training, who has graduated and who is a",64
NA,professional midwife cannot access this,64
NA,government supported insurance scheme for,64
NA,three years. What other profession has that,64
NA,sort of constraint? What does that do to a,64
NA,young woman planning to become a midwife,64
NA,when she realises that for the first three years,64
NA,she is going to have exceptionally higher,64
NA,costs in trying to find some insurance-if she,64
NA,can-to cover that three-year period? It is,64
NA,extremely difficult. I refer in particular to Ms,64
NA,Andrea Quanchi. She is a midwife with 25-,64
NA,plus years experience. Her daughter recently,64
NA,graduated and of course she is not eligible,64
NA,for insurance right now. She wants to join,65
NA,her mother as a midwife in private practice.,65
NA,"Andrea is a brilliant, professional and highly",65
NA,respected midwife who is the only midwife,65
NA,in private practice serving a large part of,65
NA,southern New South Wales and all of,65
NA,northern Victoria. She is an extraordinary,65
NA,woman doing an extraordinary job. Her,65
NA,"services are much sought after, but she is",65
NA,caught in this insurance trap whereby,65
NA,midwives must perform homebirths without,65
NA,insurance for two years. She is caught in the,65
NA,trap where she cannot bring on newly,65
NA,qualified midwives to assist her in,65
NA,homebirthing because of the three-year rule.,65
NA,She is also caught in the trap where she,65
NA,cannot get assistance from other midwives to,65
NA,do preand postnatal consultations with her,65
NA,homebirthing patients because those,65
NA,professional midwives must have the,65
NA,insurance to undertake preand postnatal,65
NA,visits.,65
NA,There was an incident recently in my part,65
NA,of the world during the very serious,65
NA,flooding. Ms Quanchi had a patient who had,65
NA,"given birth but, unfortunately, she was on",65
NA,other side of the floodwaters. She asked a,65
NA,very competent local midwife to undertake,65
NA,the postnatal consultation for her but found,65
NA,that this midwife did not have the insurance.,65
NA,She then approached the local Wangaratta,65
NA,hospital and was told they could not support,65
NA,"her because it had been a homebirth and, 'It",65
NA,was her problem.',65
NA,The member for Lyne,65
NA,"homebirthing. In Australia, we should have",65
NA,the option to homebirth and with the birth of,65
NA,subsequent children enjoy the special,65
NA,additional support that is provided to women,65
NA,in the home. As our previous speaker,65
NA,"highlighted, in Australia we have some of",65
NA,the highest levels of medical interventions in,65
NA,births in the developed world. An,65
NA,extraordinary number of caesareans are,65
NA,undertaken and too often it seems those,65
NA,caesareans are undertaken for the,65
NA,convenience of the medical profession rather,65
NA,than for the best health considerations of the,65
NA,women who are delivering.,65
NA,"As everybody knows, we have a chronic",65
NA,shortage of obstetricians and gynaecologists,65
NA,"in rural Victoria, and indeed throughout rural",65
NA,"Australia. That is why highly professional,",65
NA,competent midwives are so critical to the,65
NA,delivery of health services in rural Australia.,65
NA,It again highlights the problem with this,65
NA,government's refusal to amend its,65
NA,catastrophic independent youth allowance,65
NA,policy. The independent youth allowance,65
NA,enabled country students who had finished,65
NA,year 12 and been offered university places-,65
NA,"for example, in nursing-to go somewhere",65
NA,"else to train, typically in a capital city. Those",65
NA,would be future nurses cannot now access,65
NA,nursing training and midwifery training,65
NA,because too often their families cannot afford,65
NA,"the $20,000 or more that it costs for country",65
NA,students to be supported in their studies,65
NA,while living away from home.,65
NA,We have the absurd situation now from,65
NA,"the yesterday's budget where another 16,000",65
NA,skilled migrants will be admitted into rural,65
NA,and regional areas under the regional skilled,65
NA,"migration scheme. On the other hand, we",65
NA,have discrimination in the access to the,65
NA,independent youth allowance-,65
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms AE,65
NA,Burke): Order! I think I have been very,65
NA,generous to the member for Murray. I ask,65
NA,praised her to come back to the bill before the,65
NA,House.,65
Dr STONE, The point I was making is,65
NA,that we have a shortage of nurses and,65
NA,midwives in rural Australia. We have a,65
NA,"shortage of gynaecologists, obstetricians and",65
NA,GPs who will deliver babies. There is a,65
NA,"policy solution to all this. Firstly,",65
NA,immediately remove the three-year,65
NA,qualification period after graduation when a,65
NA,midwife cannot access the new government,66
NA,supported insurance scheme.,66
NA,government should immediately address the,66
NA,problem of homebirthing and insurance.,66
NA,With the exemption running out in June next,66
NA,"year, midwives need to know what is going",66
NA,to happen after that in regard to insurance,66
NA,and homebirths. This government must also,66
NA,realise that a threshold of performing 30,66
NA,births before you can access insurance is far,66
NA,too high for midwives in rural and regional,66
NA,Australia. Many of these midwives have,66
NA,decades of experience. They may be,66
NA,delivering 25 or 27 babies. There should be a,66
NA,case-by-case assessment of their insurance,66
NA,needs and competencies rather than a 30,66
NA,baby cut-off in their ability to access this,66
NA,MIGA scheme.,66
NA,I am concerned that the next generation of,66
NA,midwives who should be from rural and,66
NA,regional Australia and who are most likely to,66
NA,go back and practice in rural and regional,66
NA,Australia will not be able to access tertiary,66
NA,studies because of the new independent,66
NA,youth allowance policy implications. Their,66
NA,families cannot afford to help them live away,66
NA,from home during their years of study. They,66
NA,simply do not have the means.,66
NA,"As a member of the coalition, I support",66
NA,the fixing of the mistakes in these bills,66
NA,"before us today, but the legislation does not",66
NA,comprehensively address the problems,66
NA,facing Australian midwives or the problems,66
NA,facing women and families wanting to have,66
NA,"safe, well supported births in country areas,",66
NA,particularly those seeking homebirths. In the,66
NA,21st century what is happening in Australia,66
NA,is a disgrace. It is akin to the discrimination,66
NA,against midwives that occurred centuries,66
NA,ago. We just have to get over it and,66
NA,"understand that women need choices, and",66
NA,that professional midwives must be given the,66
NA,same insurance support and considerations,66
NA,This that other professions receive.,66
Ms ROXON ,Gellibrand-Minister for,66
NA,Health and Ageing) (12:14): In summing up,66
NA,I want to thank members for their,66
NA,contributions to the debate on this bill.,66
NA,"Unfortunately, a lot of members have strayed",66
NA,an extraordinarily long way from the topic. I,66
NA,might remind members opposite that to come,66
NA,in here and criticise the situation in relation,66
NA,"to midwives, when it is the Labor",66
NA,government that for the first time ever has,66
NA,properly acknowledged and provided access,66
NA,to the MBS for midwives and it is also our,66
NA,government which is the first government to,66
NA,"introduce an insurance scheme for midwives,",66
NA,and say that the situation in Australia is a,66
NA,disgrace and that other problems should be,66
NA,"fixed, which their government in 12 years",66
NA,"never ever addressed in any way, is a bit",66
NA,rich.,66
NA,The amendment to this particular bill is,66
NA,"relatively a minor one, but it is an important",66
NA,step in ensuring that appropriately qualified,66
NA,and experienced self-employed midwives,66
NA,will continue to have access to secure and,66
NA,reliable Commonwealth supported,66
NA,professional indemnity cover. This bill,66
NA,makes sense and gives certainty for self-,66
NA,employed midwives and the women and,66
NA,families that they care for. Like the,66
NA,government's recent investment in the,66
NA,Medical Benefits Scheme and the,66
NA,Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for access,66
NA,"of patients to eligible midwives, this",66
NA,amendment bill will continue to ensure that,66
NA,there is improved access to maternity,66
NA,services and improved choices for Australian,66
NA,women. That is why our government took,66
NA,this action in the first place and we are very,66
NA,proud of our record. I commend the bill to,66
NA,the House.,66

NA,Second Reading,67
NA,Debate resumed on the motion:,67
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,67
Ms LEY ,Farrer) (12:17): I rise today to,67
NA,speak on the Social Security Legislation,67
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,67
NA,2011. This bill seeks to introduce much,67
NA,needed improvements to the compliance,67
NA,requirements for job seekers. Unemployment,67
NA,is currently 4.9 per cent and many businesses,67
NA,"are crying out for staff, yet job seeker",67
NA,income support for 2011-12 is still estimated,67
NA,to cost taxpayers $7.2 billion. In March,67
NA,"2011, 179,041 job seekers were classified as",67
NA,"long-term unemployed, meaning that they",67
NA,have been on income support for 12 months,67
NA,"or more. In yesterday's budget the term,",67
NA,which is already in existence but certainly,67
NA,"featured in the budget, was 'very long-term",67
NA,unemployed'. That gives us a sense of the,67
NA,nature of this problem. On top of a very,67
NA,"sizeable income support budget, billions of",67
NA,dollars is spent by the government to provide,67
NA,job search support.,67
NA,Whilst I have a few criticisms of the,67
NA,"current system, there are countless",67
NA,organisations offering employment services,67
NA,to job seekers nationally. These people are at,67
NA,the coalface and work very hard to place,67
NA,people into jobs. On a personal note it is a,67
NA,privilege to meet people who work in our job,67
NA,"service agencies, particularly with",67
NA,challenging individuals. These people have,67
NA,dedicated their lives to getting those people,67
NA,into work and onto a meaningful pathway in,67
NA,life. But noncompliance has costs for these,67
NA,employment service providers and for,67
NA,Centrelink. Having to constantly phone job,67
NA,seekers to ask why they did not attend a,67
NA,meeting are distractions that take away from,67
NA,the core role of the employment services,67
NA,provider-getting someone into a job. It is as,67
NA,simple as that.,67
NA,Bill 2011,67
NA,We need to ensure that job seekers are,67
NA,given the support they need to take up job,67
NA,"vacancies that exist. However, if a job seeker",67
NA,"is not attending appointments, they are not",67
NA,going to get off welfare anytime soon. The,67
NA,first stage or an early stage is to attend those,67
NA,appointments. In the last 12 months,67
NA,"approximately two million job interviews,",67
NA,activities or provider appointments were,67
NA,missed by job seekers with no valid excuse,67
NA,given. This is a clear indictment of the,67
NA,failure of the current compliance system and,67
NA,of the urgent need for reform.,67
NA,We need to drastically improve job seeker,67
NA,engagement with employment services,67
NA,providers. I suspect that part of the reason for,67
NA,this abysmal attendance record stems from,67
NA,the fact that many job seekers believe they,67
NA,will not be penalised if they fail to attend an,67
NA,appointment. In all likelihood they may well,67
NA,"be right, with only half of all participation",67
NA,reports lodged with Centrelink being upheld.,67
NA,These are reports provided by the job service,67
NA,"agency to Centrelink, which is the agency",67
NA,that must withhold payment for non-,67
NA,attendance.,67
NA,We know that there are many reasons why,68
NA,people do not make job interviews and we,68
NA,understand that some of those reasons stem,68
NA,from the nature of that person's life. They,68
NA,"may be vulnerable, they may be homeless",68
NA,and they may have all sorts of issues with,68
NA,"which they are dealing, and those issues are",68
NA,recognised by the system. This is not an,68
NA,approach that suggests that everybody will,68
NA,be put into a category of losing income,68
NA,support should they not attend. But I am,68
NA,waiting with interest to see how this,68
NA,government describes those vulnerabilities in,68
NA,"the regulations. In other words, how it draws",68
NA,that very careful distinction between those,68
NA,who need a bit of a push to attend an,68
NA,"employment interview and those who, with",68
NA,"the best will in the world, cannot.",68
NA,The Rudd government has to shoulder the,68
NA,blame for watering down mutual obligation,68
NA,with their failed employment services reform,68
NA,legislation in 2008 and letters sent by both,68
NA,the then minister and the department deputy,68
NA,secretary urging providers to turn a blind eye,68
NA,to job seeker noncompliance. This was a,68
NA,"clear strategy of the Labor Party, certainly",68
NA,"the Labor Left, voicing their disapproval of",68
NA,the concept of mutual obligation. We have,68
NA,also seen Work for the Dole virtually,68
NA,abolished under Labor with the March,68
NA,"figures indicating only 9,151 people were",68
NA,participating in Work for the Dole. This,68
NA,program has been remarkably successful in,68
NA,"giving job seekers a work-like experience,",68
NA,and Teaching Skills in Demand has come,68
NA,under fire from Labor ever since its,68
NA,inception. This is a clear sign of the lack of,68
NA,commitment the government has to mutual,68
NA,obligation. But the decision that we see,68
NA,"reflected in this bill, to get a bit more serious",68
NA,about making job seekers comply with their,68
NA,"obligations, is a positive move in the right",68
NA,"direction. Unfortunately, it has taken three",68
NA,"years to come about, during which time",68
NA,many job seekers have become complacent.,68
NA,Mutual obligation requires people in receipt,68
NA,of income support to make reasonable efforts,68
NA,"to look for a job. There are, regrettably, some",68
NA,Australians who do view welfare as a,68
NA,lifestyle choice. A firm but fair compliance,68
NA,regime sends to these people the message,68
NA,that it is not okay to sit at home and cash,68
NA,your welfare cheque with no intention of,68
NA,ever really looking for a job. Income support,68
NA,payments are designed to be a temporary,68
NA,"safety net, nothing more. There is a",68
NA,continuum between somebody's obligations,68
NA,to contribute to the society in which they live,68
NA,and society's obligations to look after its,68
NA,most vulnerable and disadvantaged. We in,68
NA,the coalition will never walk away from the,68
NA,obligation that governments have to look,68
NA,after the most disadvantaged-those who,68
NA,cannot cope. But into the love has to come,68
NA,the tough. The tough love approach has been,68
NA,missing from this government's approach,68
NA,"with some fairly poor results, particularly for",68
NA,the job seekers themselves.,68
NA,Welfare dependency is a real concern in,68
NA,this country. There are suburbs where,68
NA,intergenerational unemployment is rife. We,68
NA,have to break the mindset that you can live,68
NA,"on welfare from the cradle to the grave, but",68
NA,that is a very tough challenge and it requires,68
NA,a tough approach. Children should not be,68
NA,raised to believe that they are entitled to a,68
NA,"lifetime of taxpayer funded welfare, but they",68
NA,need to be shown the benefits and,68
NA,possibilities of a job. That children are,68
NA,growing up in households where no,68
NA,generation has worked-we are into the,68
NA,fourth generation in terms of,68
NA,intergenerational unemployment-underlines,68
NA,the dimensions of that challenge. It is very,68
NA,hard for a child who has never known a,68
NA,parent or role model who has worked for a,68
NA,"living to understand the reward a job brings,",68
NA,from both a social point of view and a,68
NA,financial point of view. The best way to help,69
NA,these children overcome the disadvantage,69
NA,that faces them is to help them get a good,69
NA,education and a job.,69
NA,I mentioned the privilege of meeting,69
NA,people who work with job seekers.,69
NA,Everywhere I go I also meet those who are,69
NA,conducting the programs that try to bring a,69
NA,group of people who have been completely,69
NA,disengaged from the system back into the,69
NA,system and back onto that pathway. Some of,69
NA,"those programs work amazingly well, and I",69
NA,thank the providers. I am not going to name,69
NA,them because I would miss out on somebody,69
NA,important.,69
NA,"Just on the weekend, in the west of my",69
NA,"electorate of Farrer, near the small town of",69
NA,Pooncarie-which is on the Darling River,69
NA,for those who do not know it-I met,69
NA,somebody who was involved in taking a,69
NA,group of kids from the bush who had never,69
NA,known meaningful employment and training,69
NA,them in horticulture. The training they,69
NA,received would lead to a horticulture,69
NA,certificate II. The feedback I got about this,69
NA,"program, which is one of the government's",69
NA,"current programs, was that it was not really",69
NA,working very successfully. The young,69
NA,"people concerned would come, they would",69
NA,have the sandwiches at morning tea-which,69
NA,underscores the fact they may not have eaten,69
NA,"at home-and then they would disappear,",69
NA,because there was nothing actually forcing,69
NA,them to stay there for a day's work.,69
NA,problem was that they were completing,69
NA,training that did not really mean much to,69
NA,them at that point in time. There are times,69
NA,when there is much work for those with a,69
NA,horticulture certificate but there is an,69
NA,abundance of people qualified in this area,69
NA,"and at the moment there are very few jobs,",69
NA,given the shocking state of our wine grape,69
NA,industry. They could not see a connection,69
NA,between what they were being asked to do,69
NA,and a future job.,69
NA,"My friend was frustrated, quite frankly,",69
NA,because he had put a lot of effort in-he,69
NA,wanted them to get out of the cycle they,69
NA,were in-and people were turning up and not,69
NA,doing what they were supposed to. When he,69
NA,"asked them in detail, they said what they",69
NA,really wanted to do was to learn to read and,69
NA,write. They really wanted to learn to read,69
NA,and write because then they could get a,69
NA,drivers licence and could drive. Many of,69
NA,"these people, unfortunately, do drive but are",69
NA,not licensed. That was a practical thing that,69
NA,"they could see, and it is a piece of education",69
NA,that has been sorely missed. I see some,69
NA,literacy and numeracy funding in the,69
NA,budget-not very much-and I am really,69
NA,interested to see that it does not just dissipate,69
NA,at bureaucracy level but hits the ground in a,69
NA,really meaningful sense.,69
NA,The point is that in the current,69
NA,environment there is no TAFE course for,69
NA,these particular work experience people to,69
NA,attend that could be signed off as allowing,69
NA,them to participate in this program. They had,69
NA,to do a certificate II in horticulture or some,69
NA,"other comparable certificate, but what they",69
NA,really needed was literacy and numeracy,69
NA,change. That comes down to an area in our,69
NA,VET and training system that needs to be,69
NA,looked at carefully. So when we see the,69
NA,headline numbers and when we see that this,69
NA,"is the outcome, we really do have to look in",69
NA,"detail at the program, and the simple",69
NA,The other approach often works best.,69
NA,"To finish this story, the fellow I was",69
NA,"talking to spent quite a bit of time, out of",69
NA,"hours, teaching these young people how to",69
NA,read and write. He put in front of them,69
NA,information that was relevant-not the sort,69
NA,of story books you would see in grade 2 but,69
NA,something they could actually read: road,69
NA,"signs, traffic rules and basic instructions.",69
NA,They all came to life. They all loved it and,69
NA,"actually saw a meaning and a purpose, and",69
NA,that is the key.,69
NA,Youth unemployment remains an ongoing,70
NA,concern. We need to address this to prevent,70
NA,longer term social disadvantage. I have,70
NA,spoken with employers desperate to take on,70
NA,"apprentices, but they cannot find people",70
NA,willing to take on an apprenticeship and who,70
NA,are capable of doing so. There is currently a,70
NA,seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of,70
NA,11.3 per cent for people aged 15 to 24. That,70
NA,is just not acceptable. It is so critical that,70
NA,keep these young people engaged with their,70
NA,employment services provider and that we,70
NA,work with them to help them get the skills,70
NA,and education they need to lift them out of,70
NA,the poverty trap and decrease the threat of,70
NA,social isolation which can occur with long-,70
NA,term unemployment. Long-term,70
NA,unemployment is not that far away for,70
NA,"someone who today does not have a job, who",70
NA,lost their job three months ago. The slide,70
NA,from being in that position to being long-,70
NA,term unemployed and struggling to get a job,70
NA,can happen very fast and in quite a dramatic,70
NA,sense that affects your entire life experience.,70
NA,Something we should be aware of with the,70
NA,long-term unemployed is that it would be,70
NA,better for those in the early stages of,70
NA,unemployment to be looked after and,70
NA,"helped-that is, perhaps more help is needed",70
NA,at the front end of that experience-before,70
NA,they actually slip into,70
NA,unemployment. Underlying this legislation is,70
NA,a clear and simple message. It is one of,70
NA,responsibility. People must,70
NA,responsibility for their own lives. If they,70
NA,have a legitimate reason and are unable to,70
NA,attend a meeting with their job services,70
NA,provider or if they cannot attend a job,70
NA,interview then they need to advise in,70
NA,advance. It is simple and it echoes what the,70
NA,vast majority of us take as a given: if you,70
NA,"know you are ill, pick up the phone and let",70
NA,your office or workplace know. This is what,70
NA,is being asked of job seekers-not much,70
NA,more than a common courtesy. I know that,70
NA,vulnerable people in difficult positions may,70
NA,"not be able to manage this, but we have to",70
NA,take it as just a small thing and a step in the,70
NA,"right direction. You may still be in bed, you",70
NA,"may be struggling to cope, but you can pick",70
NA,"up the phone, you can make the call and you",70
NA,"can say, 'I will not be there for today's",70
NA,interview; I need to reschedule.' As soon as,70
NA,we somebody re-engages with their employment,70
NA,"services provider, their payment will be",70
NA,reinstated.,70
NA,"So, to put it simply, at the beginning, if",70
NA,"they do not turn up, their payment is",70
NA,"suspended. If they re-engage, their payment",70
NA,"is reinstated. Therefore, the responsibility",70
NA,rests with the job seeker to determine how,70
NA,long they will have their welfare payments,70
NA,"withheld. In other words, when they re-",70
NA,"engage, their welfare payment is reinstated",70
NA,and they will also be back paid. Those job,70
NA,seekers who do the right thing and attend,70
NA,their appointments or reschedule them in,70
NA,advance if they are not in a position to attend,70
NA,will not be penalised. But for those who,70
NA,deliberately shirk their responsibilities there,70
NA,will be a price to pay. Yet it is vital that the,70
NA,most vulnerable of these job seekers are not,70
NA,"penalised unfairly. As I said, the legislation",70
NA,"is designed to afford a measure of protection,",70
NA,long-term but we need to see how that protection is,70
NA,described in the relevant regulations.,70
NA,In my describing in a simple sense the,70
NA,take,70
NA,"principle behind this-of course, like most",70
NA,"legislation, this is full of unbelievably",70
NA,complicated detail-the House will note that,70
NA,there are significant requirements on,70
NA,Centrelink. They are that Centrelink act in,70
NA,"real time, that Centrelink suspend payments",70
NA,"while the person is disengaged and, if the",70
NA,"person reconnects, that Centrelink reinstate",70
NA,payment in order to give the person the,70
NA,message that once you are in the system and,70
NA,working to assist yourself and to meet your,71
NA,obligations then your welfare payments will,71
NA,continue.,71
NA,Those of us who understand the,71
NA,complicated computer systems in our large,71
NA,departments will agree it is quite a tall order.,71
NA,I am concerned that the IT system in,71
NA,"Centrelink may not be up to this, with the",71
NA,best will in the world. We saw that the,71
NA,"budget is slashing Public Service numbers,",71
NA,and Centrelink needs to be resourced to do,71
NA,this job properly because the whole principle,71
NA,that underpins this legislation will fall to bits,71
NA,if a person who re-engages with the system,71
NA,actually does not receive their payment and,71
NA,catch up quickly. I know that those who are,71
NA,receiving Newstart allowance-some,71
NA,$239-are not in a position to look after,71
NA,themselves. This is a necessary and tough,71
NA,"message, but it also needs the counterpart of",71
NA,the agency acting quickly to reinstate the,71
NA,funding where required. It is pretty scary,71
NA,when you look at some public policy which,71
NA,is designed around IT systems. The response,71
NA,"so often when you contact an agency is, 'The",71
NA,system won't allow it.' So we need to make,71
NA,sure that the Centrelink system does allow,71
NA,this. It is a sensible measure which should go,71
NA,a considerable way towards reversing the,71
NA,sharp increase in attendance failures by job,71
NA,seekers. We need to drive home a real work,71
NA,ethic whilst ensuring that the system is both,71
NA,reasonable and manageable.,71
NA,There are real problems with the current,71
NA,"system, and NESA have identified these in",71
NA,their submission to the House inquiry into,71
NA,this legislation. I should note that this,71
NA,legislation was referred to the House of,71
NA,Representatives Standing Committee on,71
NA,Education and Employment. The report was,71
NA,done very quickly. Congratulations to the,71
NA,members. I think it was tabled this morning.,71
NA,"NESA, who I just mentioned, are the",71
NA,National Employment Services Association.,71
NA,They are the peak body for Australian,71
NA,"employment services, the only national peak",71
NA,"body that represent the community, private,",71
NA,public and government sectors. Some of their,71
NA,comments in their submission to the House,71
NA,standing committee are instructive and I,71
NA,think they bear repeating. They make the,71
NA,point that there is clear support for the,71
NA,principle that individuals should take,71
NA,responsibility for undertaking steps to,71
NA,improve their circumstances and not be,71
NA,dependent on the welfare system to the,71
NA,extent that they have the capacity to do so.,71
NA,"NESA also believe that, following a",71
NA,"period of implementation, there will be a",71
NA,further opportunity to strengthen the,71
NA,compliance framework to better support job,71
NA,seeker engagement and workforce,71
NA,participation. They indicate that there is,71
NA,more to be done in this area and there are,71
NA,improvements that can be made around the,71
NA,compliance requirements. They note that a,71
NA,considerable investment is made by,71
NA,government to ensure the welfare of its,71
NA,citizens and to provide services to assist,71
NA,them to address circumstances. That is the,71
NA,"biggest outgoing cost that governments face,",71
NA,"and it is significant. The amendments, NESA",71
NA,"says, as outlined in the current bill are",71
NA,considered welcome improvements to the job,71
NA,seeker compliance framework and will,71
NA,provide greater emphasis on engagement and,71
NA,"participation. Because they are a peak body,",71
NA,I think it is worth noting that they have,71
NA,endorsed the principle that is at work here.,71
NA,Just on the subject of the inquiry of the,71
NA,House of Representatives standing,71
NA,"committee, there were 10 recommendations.",71
NA,"I am not going to read them all out, but there",71
NA,are a couple that I will note because I think,71
NA,that when a committee looks at legislation in,71
NA,detail and takes submissions-and there,71
NA,were some good submissions; they have not,71
NA,all agreed with this and they have not all,71
NA,"agreed with the approaches that are in place,",71
NA,but they have still been good submissions-,71
NA,the recommendations that it comes forward,72
NA,with are certainly worth noting. It,72
NA,"recommended that a brief, plain English",72
NA,explanation of the proposed changes be,72
NA,produced and made available to job seekers.,72
NA,That is so important. We are talking about,72
NA,people amongst whom many are barely,72
NA,literate. The principle is sound but if we were,72
NA,"to confront them with the requirements, even",72
NA,"perhaps not in a legislative sense, it would go",72
NA,over the heads of many of them and perhaps,72
NA,even many of us. So that is a good,72
NA,recommendation.,72
NA,The committee recommended that the,72
NA,"Department of Education, Employment and",72
NA,"Workplace Relations, the Department of",72
NA,"Human Services, employment services",72
NA,providers and other stakeholders work,72
NA,together to develop consistent guidance and,72
NA,training material to accompany the bill. That,72
NA,comes down to resources. The government,72
NA,has to not only announce measures but walk,72
NA,"the walk, and resources are needed in this",72
NA,area.,72
NA,The committee recommended that,72
NA,Centrelink and employment services,72
NA,provider staff be provided,72
NA,comprehensive training in relation to the,72
NA,measures proposed by the bill and the,72
NA,guidelines. Centrelink have a huge workload.,72
NA,Those of us who have Centrelink agencies in,72
NA,our towns and have a relationship between,72
NA,our electorate offices and those people know,72
NA,how hard they work. It seems that when the,72
NA,government-and this is common with all,72
NA,governments-needs to put a program or,72
NA,something somewhere it often ends up with,72
NA,"Centrelink. So they certainly need, as I said,",72
NA,the resources and the training. The,72
NA,committee also recommended,72
NA,employment services providers be given,72
NA,clear and comprehensive guidance on how to,72
NA,utilise their discretion to submit a,72
NA,participation report on a missed appointment.,72
NA,"We need discretion built in, because no",72
NA,government could legislate for every single,72
NA,set of circumstances for a vulnerable job,72
NA,seeker. But the discretion has to be used,72
NA,well. Officers who are required to suspend,72
NA,payments need to have the confidence when,72
NA,the time comes to actually suspend the,72
NA,payment.,72
NA,The committee also recommended that,72
NA,employment services providers should be,72
NA,advised to utilise all re-engagement,72
NA,mechanisms available to them in relation to,72
NA,vulnerable job seekers. That,72
NA,recommendation comes from having looked,72
NA,"through the submissions, including from",72
NA,ACOSS and some of the welfare rights,72
NA,organisations and headspace. That is what,72
NA,they highlighted-they were worried,72
NA,"particularly about young, vulnerable job",72
NA,seekers. We need to be assured that there is,72
NA,not a one-size-fits-all approach. I know there,72
NA,are indicators for those people already in the,72
NA,"Centrelink and Job Services system, but",72
NA,again we need to see how their,72
NA,circumstances will be addressed when this,72
NA,with actually takes place. Of course the committee,72
NA,recommended that the House pass the job,72
NA,"seeker compliance bill, which is clearly what",72
NA,we are doing.,72
NA,I said that there were real problems with,72
NA,"the current system, and NESA have",72
NA,identified those in their submission-in,72
NA,"particular, the administrative burden of",72
NA,submitting participation reports is onerous,72
NA,for providers and can in some instances take,72
NA,up to 28 days. The NESA submission says:,72
NA,"... where no reasonable excuse is determined,",72
NA,providers generally consider that the more,72
NA,that immediate loss of payment will provide better,72
NA,reinforcement and a stronger and more direct,72
NA,deterrent for the reconnection failure.,72
NA,"As I have said, we need those who operate",73
NA,within the system to have the confidence to,73
NA,actually take the step-not easy-to suspend,73
NA,"the payment, recognising that it is",73
NA,interests of the job seeker.,73
NA,"In conclusion, the coalition supports this",73
NA,shift to a more rigorous compliance,73
NA,"regime-one that is firm, but certainly still",73
NA,"fair. Under these rules, job seekers will lose",73
NA,"their payment immediately, which in turn",73
NA,should help reinforce in their mind the,73
NA,linkage between welfare and responsibility. I,73
NA,congratulate the government on finally,73
NA,recognising that the coalition's approach in,73
NA,this area is the right one. I commend the bill,73
NA,and the committee's report to the House.,73
Mr HUSIC ,Chifley) (12:39): I support,73
NA,the Social Security Legislation Amendment,73
NA,(Job Seeker Compliance) Bill 2011. I want to,73
NA,"canvass a number of matters, but specifically",73
NA,I refer to the work of my colleague the,73
NA,member for Kingston and the House of,73
NA,Representatives Standing Committee on,73
NA,"Education and Employment, which I think",73
NA,has brought down a very considered set of,73
NA,recommendations. It is important for us to,73
NA,step back and put all this within the context,73
NA,of what the government is seeking to do,73
NA,broadly in the area of welfare reform and,73
NA,especially as it sits within the needs of the,73
NA,economy-where we are at; where we sit,73
NA,right now. It is worth noting that some of the,73
NA,things that are confronting the economy have,73
NA,sat in the economy for some time and have,73
NA,been reflected upon by the Reserve Bank for,73
NA,some time. Specifically I refer to the impact,73
NA,that capacity constraints have on the,73
NA,"economy, chiefly through, for example,",73
NA,infrastructure road blocks or the impact that,73
NA,skill shortages have on the economy in,73
NA,driving wages up and not having skilled,73
NA,people to drive productivity and help the,73
NA,"economy as it moves, particularly in the",73
NA,context of us emerging from the GFC.,73
NA,Productivity has been low for many years,73
NA,and does need to be increased if we expect,73
NA,our economy to continue growing and we,73
NA,expect ourselves to make a mark on the,73
NA,in the best international scene as well.,73
NA,The challenge for us is to work out how,73
NA,"we can get people, particularly those who are",73
NA,"long-term unemployed, to participate more",73
NA,fully in the work force and how we can assist,73
NA,those people to obtain the level of personal,73
NA,"skill necessary, which is demanded by",73
NA,"industry, business and commerce today, and",73
NA,so be able to have a meaningful engagement,73
NA,"in the economy. Ultimately, I believe work",73
NA,should not of itself be seen just as an,73
NA,economic activity but as a means for people,73
NA,"to pursue their own personal aspirations,",73
NA,fund their activities and provide security and,73
NA,hope in many respects for what they want to,73
NA,"do for themselves, their families and those",73
NA,close to them and the communities in which,73
NA,they reside.,73
NA,Our economy is currently experiencing,73
NA,the equivalent of a sonic boom when it,73
NA,"comes to investment, and to ensure that the",73
NA,economy is able to progress as far as it can,73
NA,and as strongly as it can we do need to,73
NA,address infrastructure issues and capacity,73
NA,constraints brought about by skill shortages.,73
NA,Addressing skill shortages lies behind the,73
NA,budget delivered last night. It puts in place,73
NA,significant economic reforms that will help,73
NA,us in the years ahead. This bill and some of,73
NA,the other measures announced by the,73
NA,government have been designed to find a,73
NA,way to add to the pool of employees and skill,73
NA,them up and enable them to meaningfully,73
NA,engage in the economy. From within that,73
NA,"perspective, this bill, along with some of the",73
NA,"other work done in the budget, is designed to",73
NA,have a meaningful impact.,73
NA,The bill was referred to the education and,73
NA,employment committee on 24 March for,73
NA,"inquiry, and 16 submissions were received.",73
NA,"My colleague the member for Kingston, the",73
NA,"chair of the committee, tabled the advisory",74
NA,report on the Social Security Legislation,74
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,74
NA,"this morning. One thing that is noteworthy,",74
NA,and I think this was reflected upon by the,74
NA,"member for Kingston, is the degree of",74
NA,passion for social welfare and the,74
NA,commitment to employment participation.,74
NA,The inquiry drew comments from a range of,74
NA,"different perspectives, but clearly people are",74
NA,concerned to ensure that the jobless are,74
NA,"engaged back in the economy-but, at the",74
NA,"same time, in seeking to meet this objective",74
NA,we need to ensure the conditions imposed are,74
NA,not onerous or counterproductive.,74
NA,I sought to engage with people in the,74
NA,"Chifley electorate on this issue, and I",74
NA,discussed some of these plans with people,74
NA,who had been fortunate enough to graduate,74
NA,from the Green Jobs program in Western,74
NA,Sydney. I anticipated only being there for a,74
NA,short period of time for the graduation and in,74
NA,"fact stayed for two hours, canvassing a range",74
NA,of issues with some people who I believe are,74
NA,a credit to their community. We discussed,74
NA,the things that they want to do in progressing,74
NA,from a position where they believed they did,74
NA,not have an opportunity to get a job that was,74
NA,"meaningful, beneficial and satisfying to them",74
NA,to a position now where they are looking,74
NA,with a great degree of confidence to where,74
NA,they head. They said to me that when they,74
NA,engaged with job providers one of their,74
NA,concerns was that they were referred to job,74
NA,interviews that they do not themselves feel,74
NA,will provide them with a job that will sustain,74
NA,their interest into the long term. One of the,74
NA,things that I am very mindful of with this bill,74
NA,"is that, while you can refer people to job",74
NA,"interviews, there obviously has to be a",74
NA,connection with the interests of the person,74
NA,you are referring to those interviews.,74
NA,Interviews are one thing; accepting a final,74
NA,offer of employment is another. But in that,74
NA,meeting and that very positive discussion,74
NA,that I had with young people in Western,74
NA,Sydney who had been unemployed for quite,74
NA,some time they indicated to me that they,74
NA,would be referred to employers for work that,74
NA,they were not interested in.,74
NA,"In fact, I recall that one of the successful",74
NA,graduates said to me: 'The reason I was,74
NA,attracted to this program was simple. I was at,74
NA,a job provider's premises'-this is how,74
NA,simple it was-'and I saw a brochure that,74
NA,was green. I turned it over and it talked about,74
NA,this program. I said instantly that this was,74
NA,what I wanted to do.' So he followed it up.,74
NA,He stuck with the program. This person is,74
NA,now going to be engaged in horticulture in a,74
NA,"major Western Sydney council, Hawkesbury",74
NA,City Council. I remember just the enthusiasm,74
NA,on his face and the fact that he said: 'I didn't,74
NA,want to go into a warehouse-it wasn't for,74
NA,me. I didn't want to go into the logistics,74
NA,industry or transport. I wanted to do,74
NA,something with my hands but outside and,74
NA,feeling like I was making a contribution to,74
NA,the environment.',74
NA,"The key with job providers, as I said, is",74
NA,obviously that referring people on for,74
NA,interviews is just one thing. Making sure that,74
NA,"they attend is important, as is checking, if",74
NA,"that person does not attend, that they have a",74
NA,reasonable excuse as to why. I note that the,74
NA,member for Kingston indicated today that,74
NA,there has been a recommendation put,74
NA,"forward for some moderation in the criteria,",74
NA,so that 'reasonable' rather than 'special',74
NA,excuses should be taken into account by,74
NA,Centrelink before making a decision on,74
NA,benefits. I think that is an important measure.,74
NA,I was equally moved to consider the point,74
NA,made by the member for Melbourne that,74
NA,"engagement with the social security system,",74
NA,social security law and practice as,74
NA,maintained by Centrelink does present,74
NA,people with a challenge in its complexity.,75
NA,"The member for Kingston, the chair of the",75
NA,"committee, also reflected in her contribution",75
NA,this morning on the importance of having,75
NA,plain English materials available to explain,75
NA,to people these measures that will be,75
NA,"enacted, letting them understand clearly what",75
NA,is at stake and their rights and,75
NA,responsibilities under this system.,75
NA,I think these are important measures. But,75
NA,"again I come back to the point that, if we put",75
NA,"in place a punitive measure, that will not be",75
NA,to the longer term benefit of the people we,75
NA,"are seeking to help. I am encouraged, having",75
NA,had discussions with the member for,75
NA,"Kingston on this issue, because I have a deep",75
NA,"interest in the bill, particularly for the seat",75
NA,"that I represent-Chifley, in Western",75
NA,"Sydney, where we have our fair share of",75
NA,long-term unemployed and where retention,75
NA,rates are lower than the national average. In,75
NA,"fact, when I reflect on it, political parties",75
NA,either persuasion have sought to tighten up,75
NA,compliance in welfare reform. It makes for,75
NA,"great headlines, but whether or not it has a",75
NA,meaningful impact on the long-term,75
NA,unemployed is the next step that needs to be,75
NA,considered.,75
NA,In terms of the long-term unemployed,75
NA,"themselves, we potentially look to hit a",75
NA,barrier where some of those people are not,75
NA,engaging in the economy for particular,75
NA,"reasons-one of which, I would advance, is",75
NA,"mental health issues, for example, or",75
NA,disability. What support measures are in,75
NA,place to ensure that they can start to engage,75
NA,with employers and take on work? It is not,75
NA,that they do not have a passion for it; it is,75
NA,that there are barriers that need to be,75
NA,addressed. We always need to be mindful of,75
NA,"those. Again, in the consultations and",75
NA,"discussions with the chair, the member for",75
NA,"Kingston, she said that this was a matter that",75
NA,had come up during the course of the public,75
NA,submissions and meetings that took place. It,75
NA,"was reflected upon, too, that for people who",75
NA,"did engage in the system who had, for",75
NA,"example, a mental health issue or a",75
NA,"disability, even if they had short periods of",75
NA,work and then lapsed-for want of a better,75
NA,"term, for the purpose of ease of discussion in",75
NA,this debate-they still found a point at which,75
NA,they could re-engage and those periods of,75
NA,engagement lengthened. That is important as,75
NA,well.,75
NA,"As I said, both sides of the House take",75
NA,"punitive measures in this regard, and I am",75
NA,certainly not a bleeding heart. I think the,75
NA,"priority is to keep people engaged in work, to",75
NA,keep people in a position where they are able,75
NA,to earn money for their own sake and their,75
NA,family's sake and meet the aspirations that,75
NA,they have for themselves and the ones they,75
NA,love. But this problem of long-term,75
NA,unemployment has bedevilled both sides of,75
NA,politics and we need to have (1) a,75
NA,of commitment to provide adequate resources,75
NA,and (2) patience so that we will commit over,75
NA,the long term to dealing with this long-term,75
NA,problem. We need to deal with the problem,75
NA,"from an economic perspective, because",75
NA,particularly in an environment where we,75
NA,have skills shortages we must get those,75
NA,"people re-engaged, and from a social and",75
NA,community perspective as well. Those are,75
NA,the points that I am very mindful of in this,75
NA,"debate, in considering this bill, and in",75
NA,broader welfare reform as well. But this does,75
NA,not deny-both sides of politics share this-,75
NA,that we do need to find ways to keep people,75
NA,engaged in the economy and in the,75
NA,community.,75
NA,"From an employment perspective,",75
NA,particularly through the course of a global,75
NA,financial crisis when 16 million jobs were,75
NA,"lost in other advanced economies, I am",75
NA,proud of the fact that in our country we have,75
NA,"been able to create more than 300,000 jobs",75
NA,since the GFC began. That included a,75
NA,"training program, Work for the Dole projects",75
NA,"et cetera. In this year's budget, as I have",76
NA,"mentioned, the government is working",76
NA,towards and continuing its commitment to,76
NA,"building our future workforce capabilities,",76
NA,especially through training and skilling,76
NA,Australians to boost the economy. It is,76
NA,building on the reforms the government has,76
NA,"delivered in education, welfare and",76
NA,employment services. With obtaining a job,76
NA,comes a sense of responsibility and personal,76
NA,"commitment, especially for the long-term",76
NA,unemployed for whom motivation to seek a,76
NA,"job is difficult. However, there are many",76
NA,opportunities available and means to obtain,76
NA,assistance. The Minister for Employment,76
NA,Participation has previously said that for,76
NA,many years the rate at which job seekers,76
NA,attend appointments with employment,76
NA,services has been around 55 per cent and that,76
NA,the system is demand driven and there are no,76
NA,more waiting lists. This calls for a greater,76
NA,improvement in the appointments designed,76
NA,to help job seekers get into work. The bill,76
NA,improves the relationship of those seeking,76
NA,work and those wanting to help them find,76
NA,work .The proposed bill is a method to,76
NA,encourage job seekers to take steps to attend,76
NA,that first crucial appointment and to continue,76
NA,these appointments to help find work.,76
NA,"Attending an appointment, commitment and",76
NA,punctuality are skills that job seekers can,76
NA,take when applying for future jobs.,76
NA,The suspension of income support,76
NA,payments for job seekers who fail to attend,76
NA,an appointment or participate in an activity,76
NA,with their employment service provider,76
NA,sends a sense of immediacy and seriousness,76
NA,at the importance of attending those,76
NA,appointments and activities to help find a,76
NA,job. If the job seeker fails to re-engage and,76
NA,does not have a reasonable excuse-a,76
NA,reconnection failure for missing their,76
NA,appointments-then there will be a penalty,76
NA,"deducted from their next payment. However,",76
NA,if the job seeker then agrees to re-engage and,76
NA,to stay engaged and meet this requirement,76
NA,then payment is restored in full. The bill,76
NA,heads up job seekers to go down the right,76
NA,path and early intervention at the appropriate,76
NA,appointment stage looks at those affected by,76
NA,long-term unemployment. The bill,76
NA,encourages recipients into participation in,76
NA,work and community life and is part of our,76
NA,commitment to welfare reform. I commend,76
NA,the bill to the House.,76
Mr TUDGE ,Aston) (12:54): I rise to,76
NA,speak on and support the Social Security,76
NA,Legislation Amendment (Job Seeker,76
NA,Compliance) Bill 2011. The bill in question,76
NA,will enhance the current job seeker,76
NA,compliance framework by providing,76
NA,additional incentives for job seekers to,76
NA,engage with their employment service,76
NA,providers and to participate fully in activities,76
NA,designed to improve their employment,76
NA,prospects. The bill is going to introduce,76
NA,suspension of payment for job seekers,76
NA,following an initial failure to attend an,76
NA,"appointment or, in some instances, an",76
NA,activity such as training or Work for the,76
NA,Dole. As soon as a job seeker agrees to,76
NA,"attend the appointment, however, their",76
NA,payment will be restored with full back,76
NA,payment.,76
NA,Under this bill all job seekers will be,76
NA,required to attend a rescheduled appointment,76
NA,regardless of their reasoning for missing the,76
NA,initial one. If the job seeker attends the,76
NA,rescheduled appointment they will not be,76
NA,"penalised as such. If a job seeker, however,",76
NA,"does not attend the rescheduled appointment,",76
NA,payment will again be suspended but this,76
NA,time if they do not have a reasonable excuse,76
NA,for missing the appointment they will incur a,76
NA,reconnection failure and lose payment for,76
NA,each day from the second missed,76
NA,appointment until they do attend a,76
NA,"rescheduled appointment-that is, there will",77
NA,be no back pay for that particular period.,77
NA,Why is this particular bill necessary?,77
NA,There are reasons both in principle and in,77
NA,philosophy and there are also some very,77
NA,specific reasons why this bill is necessary.,77
NA,Let me first outline some of the broader,77
NA,principles why this bill is necessary. The,77
NA,broader principle is that we should be doing,77
NA,everything that we can to reasonably get,77
NA,people off welfare and into work. We do no,77
NA,"service to anybody, whether it is to the",77
NA,broader community or indeed to unemployed,77
NA,"people, by allowing people to stay on",77
NA,welfare without any responsibilities being,77
NA,attached to that welfare payment. I do not,77
NA,believe that we are a compassionate society,77
NA,by not attaching responsibilities to welfare.,77
NA,"In fact, I do not think it is compassionate at",77
NA,all to not attach responsibilities to welfare.,77
NA,have seen this in my own electorate of Aston,77
NA,where people who become welfare,77
NA,dependent over time and do not accept jobs,77
NA,that are available for them to pursue become,77
NA,debilitated and you end up having long-term,77
NA,welfare dependence and long-term,77
NA,debilitation.,77
NA,I have also seen this in Indigenous,77
NA,communities at close quarters. I spent a few,77
NA,years working with Noel Pearson in the Cape,77
NA,York Institute where we were working on,77
NA,some welfare reform measures which indeed,77
NA,have become some of the groundbreaking,77
NA,welfare reform measures that are being,77
NA,rolled out in other places across Australia.,77
NA,The insight which Noel Pearson had was that,77
NA,"long-term welfare without reciprocity,",77
NA,without responsibility being added to welfare,77
NA,"payments, can indeed lead to debilitation. I",77
NA,think that is a very important point which,77
NA,Pearson has been making very strongly for,77
NA,the last decade. He has spearheaded that,77
NA,effort to get all of us to be thinking,77
NA,differently about welfare-that it should not,77
NA,be a destination in itself but rather rightly,77
NA,considered a safety net for people in difficult,77
NA,circumstances and that welfare has,77
NA,responsibilities attached to it as well. So that,77
NA,"is a very, very important principle which I",77
NA,think we need to stop and pause and think,77
NA,about. That should govern our actions in,77
NA,"relation to welfare reform efforts-that is,",77
NA,that there is responsibility attached to,77
NA,welfare payments.,77
NA,The coalition has been talking about this,77
NA,broad principle for a long time. We,77
NA,introduced in the Howard government the,77
NA,Work for the Dole scheme and we also,77
NA,introduced mutual obligation as a broad,77
NA,principle. These were both very good,77
NA,measures which were put in place. I am,77
NA,pleased that the government is now saying,77
NA,that it also believes in some of those,77
NA,"principles. I certainly was concerned, I think",77
NA,"I it was in 2008, when the employment",77
NA,minister at the time was telling Centrelink,77
NA,officers that they should not be breaching,77
NA,people who had not been delivering upon,77
NA,their job compliance requirements. I think it,77
NA,is important that we have a system in place,77
NA,and that it is adhered to. That is the broader,77
NA,philosophical reason why I think this bill is,77
NA,an important step in the right direction. If we,77
NA,"look at the actual specifics, we will also see",77
NA,that action needs to be taken in this particular,77
NA,"area. When we look at the data we see that,",77
NA,"currently, unemployment is at a low point,",77
NA,about 4.9 per cent. By long-term historical,77
NA,standards we have very low unemployment.,77
NA,"At the same time, however, there are",77
NA,"179,000 people in long-term unemployment",77
NA,and there are of course many people who are,77
NA,in short-term unemployment. One of the key,77
NA,economic issues that we have at the same,77
NA,"time is indeed a labour shortage, a skills",77
NA,shortage. I hear about it every day in my,77
NA,electorate and we read about it in the,77
NA,newspapers on a daily basis: businesses,77
NA,cannot find workers-sometimes workers at,77
NA,"be reasonably entry level jobs, low-skill jobs.",77
NA,"Of course, there is also great demand for",78
NA,skilled workers. But at the same time that,78
NA,these jobs are going begging only 55 per cent,78
NA,of job seekers are actually attending,78
NA,appointments with employment service,78
NA,providers. So 45 per cent of appointments,78
NA,with job service providers are being missed.,78
NA,"In the last 12 months alone, approximately",78
NA,"two million job interviews, activities or",78
NA,provider appointments were missed. These,78
NA,are staggering numbers. When only 55 per,78
NA,cent of people are attending their,78
NA,appointments then I think we do need to look,78
NA,more closely at that and strengthen some of,78
NA,the compliance measures. This bill heads in,78
NA,the right direction on that.,78
NA,The bill itself outlines a broad framework.,78
NA,"In some respects, the devil in the detail of",78
NA,this bill will come about by looking at the,78
NA,specifics of what is defined as a 'reasonable,78
NA,excuse' for not attending an appointment. Of,78
NA,"course, there are many valid, legitimate",78
NA,reasons for not attending an appointment.,78
NA,You could be in an accident yourself and,78
NA,therefore physically unable to get to an,78
NA,appointment. There could be other very,78
NA,legitimate reasons why you cannot make an,78
NA,appointment and they should be specified,78
NA,and documented so that Centrelink officials,78
NA,are aware of those. But we do not want to,78
NA,make the list so broad that it will be overly,78
NA,easy for a job seeker to avoid having to,78
NA,deliver upon their obligations. We need to,78
NA,carefully think about and carefully define,78
NA,what a reasonable excuse is for not attending,78
NA,interviews or job seeker appointments. We,78
NA,will be watching very carefully what the,78
NA,regulations say in relation to that.,78
NA,We also need to look at what the burden,78
NA,on Centrelink will be. This bill introduces,78
NA,some additional burdens on Centrelink to,78
NA,ensure that the measures can be enacted and,78
NA,enacted in a timely manner. Centrelink,78
NA,obviously needs to be properly resourced to,78
NA,deal with these additional burdens so that the,78
NA,agency can act quickly and send the message,78
NA,quickly to the job seeker so that the job,78
NA,seeker understands that a penalty will be,78
NA,coming. I assume this will also require,78
NA,additional IT investment in Centrelink's,78
NA,systems for that to occur. That needs to be,78
NA,"examined, and I have heard very little about",78
NA,what is going to occur in that area.,78
NA,There are also some recommendations and,78
NA,other issues which should be addressed,78
NA,concurrently with the introduction of this,78
NA,bill. Some of these came up at the House of,78
NA,Representatives Standing Committee on,78
NA,Education and Employment inquiry into this,78
NA,bill. I was a part of that inquiry. Some of,78
NA,those recommendations are quite sensible.,78
NA,One is the need for additional research or,78
NA,additional data to be collected on exactly,78
NA,why people are failing to meet their job,78
NA,seeker appointments and their requirements,78
NA,under the compliance regimes. The,78
NA,"Brotherhood of St Laurence, which made a",78
NA,"submission, suggested that we need a 'more",78
NA,considered understanding through research,78
NA,of the reasons why the various subgroups,78
NA,and subpopulations of job seekers are not,78
NA,connecting well with their service providers'.,78
NA,I think the recommendation that additional,78
NA,research be undertaken is sensible.,78
NA,I will highlight some of the other,78
NA,recommendations that came out of the House,78
NA,of Representatives inquiry that I think the,78
NA,"government should consider closely and,",78
NA,"hopefully, enact. Recommendation 2",78
NA,recommended 'developing consistent,78
NA,guidance and training materials to,78
NA,accompany the bill'. I think recommendation,78
NA,4 is worthy of consideration and,78
NA,implementation. The committee,78
NA,recommended that employment service,78
NA,providers be given clear and comprehensive,78
NA,guidance as to how to utilise their discretion,79
NA,to submit a participation report on a missed,79
NA,"appointment. In fact, one issue which came",79
NA,out very strongly through the parliamentary,79
NA,inquiry was that employment service,79
NA,providers do have a broad range of discretion,79
NA,and that having additional guidelines would,79
NA,help them make responsible and timely,79
NA,decisions.,79
NA,"Let me conclude by, again, reiterating my",79
NA,support for this bill. I think it is a bill,79
NA,is heading in the right direction as a further,79
NA,measure of welfare reform. As I said,79
NA,"previously, welfare reform is something",79
NA,which the coalition has been talking about,79
NA,"for some time, and it enacted some important",79
NA,measures when it was in government. It is,79
NA,also an area in which I have had a personal,79
NA,interest and have worked for a period of,79
NA,time. I support the measures. I hope that they,79
NA,do have an impact in supporting job seekers,79
NA,to find work which they can get satisfaction,79
NA,from doing and in getting them off the,79
NA,welfare payment system.,79
Mr NEUMANN ,Blair) (13:06): I speak,79
NA,in support of the Social Security Legislation,79
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,79
NA,2011. Last night in his budget speech the,79
NA,"Treasurer talked about jobs, workforce",79
NA,participation and getting for people what the,79
NA,Prime Minister has often described as the,79
NA,benefit and dignity of work. I would describe,79
NA,it as self-esteem and self-belief; that is what,79
NA,it is about. Getting a person a job is the best,79
NA,way to redistribute wealth in this country.,79
NA,The old-fashioned notions that you engage in,79
NA,some sort of Marxist or communistic,79
NA,redistribution of wealth are well and truly,79
NA,gone out of the pantheon of responsible,79
NA,political parties in this country. The idea,79
NA,get a person a job. If you create jobs you,79
NA,"create wealth, you create financial security",79
NA,"and you create self-esteem, not just in the",79
NA,household but in the next generation.,79
NA,Intergenerational poverty is attacked by,79
NA,getting a person a job. Sometimes you need,79
NA,to be tough; you need to be a person who,79
NA,gives someone a prod. A government,79
NA,sometimes needs to do that. Sometimes,79
NA,governments need to express that tough love.,79
NA,Sometimes we need to actually provide an,79
NA,incentive for people to break out of the cycle,79
NA,of the despair and depression of,79
NA,unemployment.,79
NA,Last night the Treasurer talked about,79
NA,which creating infrastructure projects that will,79
NA,create jobs in my home state of Queensland.,79
NA,This bill is about making sure that people,79
NA,will work in those types of projects-,79
NA,projects that will create important wealth,79
NA,across Queensland through the mining boom,79
NA,"and across the agricultural sector, in retail",79
NA,and construction and all across South-East,79
NA,Queensland and Queensland generally. What,79
NA,we saw last night was the creation of,79
NA,"incentives to work, a carrot-and-stick",79
NA,approach that will deliver a new workplace,79
NA,"development fund to create 130,000 new",79
NA,training places over four years. In my home,79
NA,state of Queensland we will see trade,79
NA,"apprentice income bonuses for 95,800",79
NA,"Queenslanders, who will receive a $1,700",79
NA,"benefit. In my electorate, 2,786 people will",79
NA,enjoy the benefit of that sort of trade bonus,79
NA,income assistance.,79
NA,"You will see incentives for employment,",79
NA,and that is what we are talking about here in,79
NA,this legislation-incentives to help people to,79
NA,get jobs. Obviously in my electorate we will,79
NA,"need that help as we recover from the flood,",79
NA,but we will see that help across Queensland.,79
NA,"In Queensland, 48,887 of the very long-term",79
NA,unemployed-people who have been without,79
NA,work for two years or more-will get help to,79
NA,"is to find work and prepare for work, with an",79
NA,additional $2.7 million from 2012 to 2015 to,79
NA,support local employment services as well.,79
NA,We are going to see that across Queensland,79
NA,"and elsewhere, and we are going to see that",79
NA,as we get these people back into,80
NA,employment.,80
NA,Unemployment in this country is 4.9 per,80
NA,cent. In America it is about 8.8 per cent and,80
NA,across the European zone it is about 9.9 per,80
NA,cent. As the Treasurer said in a speech I,80
NA,"heard not more than 10 or 15 minutes ago,",80
NA,we do not have a person to spare. So,80
NA,legislation of the sort before us today,80
NA,in with the narrative we are talking about in,80
NA,"creating wealth, creating jobs, creating",80
NA,productivity growth and making sure that,80
NA,economic development is spread across the,80
NA,"whole economy, particularly in flood",80
NA,affected areas of Queensland.,80
NA,This bill represents another example of,80
NA,how the federal Labor government is helping,80
NA,unemployed people back to work. I grew up,80
NA,in a household in which my dad was a,80
NA,cleaner at the meatworks and my mum was a,80
NA,"shop assistant, so I knew how important a",80
NA,job was in what is traditionally described as,80
NA,a working-class family in Ipswich. I know,80
NA,"the importance of hard work to self-esteem,",80
NA,"to career possibilities, to being able to fulfil",80
NA,"potential, to provide for your family the kind",80
NA,of financial security it needs and to build a,80
NA,worthwhile life of not just affluence but also,80
NA,security. Employment is absolutely essential,80
NA,to creating a productive nation and to,80
NA,"supporting families, and to give a firm",80
NA,direction to job seekers is absolutely critical.,80
NA,This bill implements our election,80
NA,commitment to introduce tougher rules for,80
NA,job seekers. Announced on 11 August 2010,80
NA,as part of our program was a policy named,80
NA,Modernising Australia's Welfare System.,80
NA,The amendments in this bill will improve the,80
NA,current job seeker compliance framework by,80
NA,providing additional incentives for job,80
NA,seekers to engage with their employment,80
NA,service providers and to participate fully in,80
NA,activities designed to improve their,80
NA,employment prospects.,80
NA,We have seen over and over how long-,80
NA,"term unemployment can destroy self-esteem,",80
NA,create intergenerational poverty and cause,80
NA,"whole communities to go into despair, to go",80
NA,into activities of crime and to have poor,80
NA,health outcomes and regression. When,80
NA,does fit communities are not healthy in their,80
NA,"economic prospect, people get an unhealthy",80
NA,physical outlook on life and engage in all,80
NA,kinds of nefarious behaviour. So getting a,80
NA,person a job is a good way not just to reduce,80
NA,criminal activities but also to improve the,80
NA,prospects of regional and rural areas as well,80
NA,as urban areas across the country.,80
NA,Too many Australians who are without a,80
NA,job and are capable of work rely on,80
NA,unemployment benefits or the like. At a time,80
NA,when our economy is going from strength to,80
NA,"strength, particularly enjoying the benefit of",80
NA,"the mining boom, we need to make sure we",80
NA,can get people into employment. Talking to,80
NA,"manufacturing industries in my electorate, in",80
NA,"Ipswich and Somerset, as well as people in",80
NA,the metalworks industries across my,80
NA,electorate and big employers like Swift,80
NA,"Australia at Dinmore, where there is one of",80
NA,"the biggest meatworks across the country, I",80
NA,hear them crying out for more and more,80
NA,employment. We are seeing more and more,80
NA,"people going from, say, the Bremer Institute",80
NA,"of TAFE, before they have completed their",80
NA,"TAFE courses, onto the mining sector. So we",80
NA,"are creating these workforce shortages,",80
NA,"scattered around economies west, south and",80
NA,north of Brisbane.,80
NA,This government is determined to make,80
NA,sure that unemployed people get back in the,80
NA,workforce and can be engaged as productive,80
NA,members of our society. People who have,80
NA,jobs are more likely to engage in civic,80
NA,society. They are more likely to be involved,80
NA,in sporting groups and RSLs. They are more,81
NA,likely to be involved in church and charitable,81
NA,work. They are more likely to help the,81
NA,homeless. They are more likely to be on P&F,81
NA,associations. They are more likely to,81
NA,"participate in civic life, because they feel",81
NA,they have a stake in it. So this is good not,81
NA,just for social inclusion but for social equity,81
NA,and for the benefit of our economic,81
NA,development. At times it means that we have,81
NA,"to be disciplined; we have to be tough, and",81
NA,the government takes a parens patriae,81
NA,approach when it comes to this. It is a case of,81
NA,"adopting a fairly paternalistic approach, but",81
NA,it is necessary. This bill will introduce,81
NA,suspension of payments for job seekers,81
NA,following an initial failure to attend an,81
NA,"appointment or, in some circumstances, an",81
NA,activity such as a Work for the Dole scheme.,81
NA,As soon as the job seeker agrees to attend,81
NA,"this appointment, their payment will be",81
NA,restored with full back pay. All job seekers,81
NA,will be required to attend a rescheduled,81
NA,appointment regardless of their reason for,81
NA,missing the first appointment. If a job seeker,81
NA,"attends the rescheduled appointment, they",81
NA,"will not be penalised. In this way, job",81
NA,seekers will learn to understand the,81
NA,importance of taking personal measures to,81
NA,ensure that they find work. When they get a,81
NA,"job, if the job starts at 9 am, they cannot",81
NA,"say, 'I'm going to turn up at 10 or 11 am.'",81
NA,What employer would want that? They need,81
NA,"discipline in their lives, and the discipline",81
NA,that they will gain in attending these,81
NA,rescheduled appointments will be very,81
NA,"important for them. In this way, job seekers",81
NA,will be encouraged to actively look for future,81
NA,employment prospects and will get used to,81
NA,the idea of fulfilling their obligations.,81
NA,Should a job seeker not attend a,81
NA,"rescheduled appointment, payment will again",81
NA,"be suspended. But this time, if they do not",81
NA,have a reasonable excuse for missing the,81
NA,"appointment, they will incur a reconnection",81
NA,failure fee and lose payment for each day,81
NA,from the second missed appointment until,81
NA,they reconnect. And they will not receive,81
NA,any back pay. That is the stick approach.,81
NA,There is punishment. Reasonable-excuse,81
NA,provisions are going to be tightened so that if,81
NA,a job seeker has a reasonable excuse for not,81
NA,attending an appointment or activity it will,81
NA,not be accepted if they could have given,81
NA,advance notice of their inability to attend. In,81
NA,"this way, job seekers will be under no",81
NA,illusions as to the expectation of the federal,81
NA,Labor government that they need to take,81
NA,responsibility in securing employment. In,81
NA,"this way, the self-esteem, the pride or the",81
NA,dignity-whatever you want to call it-of,81
NA,work and the value of contributing to the,81
NA,ongoing prosperity of their country and their,81
NA,respective communities can become an,81
NA,important part of their lives. That will be,81
NA,good for them and good for their children as,81
NA,well. If they have not experienced it in the,81
NA,"past, it will be good for them to pass on that",81
NA,"message-as employers will, no doubt, when",81
NA,they ultimately find a job.,81
NA,We cannot afford lost opportunities in,81
NA,terms of employment. In an electorate like,81
NA,"mine, which includes the two fastest growing",81
NA,"areas in south-east Queensland, Somerset at",81
NA,4.2 per cent growth last year and Ipswich at,81
NA,"just 3.5 per cent growth, we cannot afford to",81
NA,have people not in employment. The,81
NA,development of the whole corridor west of,81
NA,"Brisbane is crucial, and jobs created locally,",81
NA,"with people trained and employed locally,",81
NA,are absolutely vital.,81
NA,This approach involves us engaging in,81
NA,what I would have to describe as some pretty,81
NA,tough big brother tactics. But that is,81
NA,absolutely necessary. We know that job,81
NA,opportunities are crucial. We need to tell,81
NA,people that. We need to tell that to our,81
NA,children and our neighbours and our friends.,81
NA,As someone who has employed dozens and,81
NA,"dozens of people in his working life, I can",81
NA,tell you that it is extremely important that,82
NA,you get the right person for the job and that,82
NA,that person knows that they have to turn up,82
NA,"on time, be there, work and contribute. This",82
NA,approach looks tough. It is tough. It should,82
NA,"be tough, because it will benefit the",82
NA,Australian economy. I commend the,82
NA,legislation to the House.,82
Dr SOUTHCOTT ,Boothby) (13:18): In,82
NA,speaking on the Social Security Legislation,82
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,82
NA,"2011, it is worth going back three years to",82
NA,the heady days of Kevin 07 and the first,82
NA,months of the government and all of the,82
NA,things that Labor had promised that sounded,82
NA,so good at the time but which have turned,82
NA,out to be massive failures. These include the,82
NA,"trades training centres, the productivity",82
NA,"places program, the GP superclinics and,",82
NA,"later, pink batts and school halls. You need",82
NA,to have a memory longer than a goldfish to,82
NA,remember why we are debating this. When,82
NA,Labor were elected they proceeded to,82
NA,dismantle the Job Network and they wound,82
NA,back the principle of mutual obligation that,82
NA,had underpinned the creation of more than,82
NA,"two million jobs, more than one million of",82
NA,them full-time jobs.,82
NA,"I have a personal interest in this because,",82
NA,as opposition spokesperson on employment,82
NA,"participation from 2007 to 2009, I remember",82
NA,what the Labor Party did. When they came,82
NA,"into government, very early on the",82
NA,departmental secretary advised employment,82
NA,service providers to be lenient on job,82
NA,regarding their mutual obligations. But then,82
NA,"they came up with this concept of no show,",82
NA,no pay. The opposition warned at the time,82
NA,that this would be a failure-a massive,82
NA,failure-and that it would see a rise in long-,82
NA,term unemployment and do nothing to,82
NA,"address welfare dependency. Today, we have",82
NA,the very sorry picture of Australia having,82
NA,one of the highest rates of jobless families in,82
NA,the world. We need to go back and,82
NA,remember why mutual obligation is,82
NA,important.,82
NA,Work for the Dole is commonly,82
NA,understood as being one of the landmark,82
NA,programs of mutual obligation. Since it was,82
NA,"introduced in 1997, more than 600,000 have",82
NA,participated in Work for the Dole. They have,82
NA,gained the discipline and dignity of,82
NA,performing useful work while developing,82
NA,life skills critical to obtaining and keeping a,82
NA,real job. The Labor Party promised to keep,82
NA,Work for the Dole at the 2007 election. But,82
NA,by their actions they have allowed it to decay,82
NA,and become a hollow shell of what it was.,82
NA,"Since 2007, Work for the Dole participation",82
NA,"has fallen by 60 per cent to less than 10,000.",82
NA,"Under the coalition, Work for the Dole",82
NA,projects were designed to address at least one,82
NA,skill in demand. Work for the Dole helped by,82
NA,breaking the cycle of welfare dependency,82
NA,and encouraging a work ethic. It helped to,82
NA,get job seekers job ready. The evidence,82
NA,shows that the longer someone is out of the,82
NA,workforce the less likely it is that they will,82
NA,ever work again. Work for the Dole provides,82
NA,"people with a job-like experience, giving",82
NA,them skills and getting them into a work,82
NA,routine. The coalition has always held very,82
NA,strongly that those in receipt of,82
NA,unemployment benefits must recognise that,82
NA,they have a subsequent responsibility to look,82
NA,for work and contribute back to the society,82
NA,seekers that supports them. When Labor were,82
NA,"elected, they proposed the introduction of a",82
NA,"no-show, no-pay compliance system.",82
NA,"Incredibly, this meant that, if a job seeker",82
NA,"missed a job interview, if they did not turn",82
NA,up to a Work for the Dole activity or if they,82
NA,did not attend an appointment with their,82
NA,"employment service provider, they were",82
NA,"docked one day's pay, $44.93 as at 5",82
NA,"December 2008, when it was introduced.",82
NA,It gives me no pleasure at all to say that,83
NA,the points the opposition made in late 2008,83
NA,and early 2009 have been proven right. At,83
NA,the time in October 2008 when Labor,83
NA,"introduced this failed system, I said:",83
NA,In striking a balance between engagement and,83
NA,"sanction, the government have got the balance",83
NA,wrong.,83
NA,I also said:,83
NA,"Going into the future, we will see, sadly,",83
NA,increased numbers of long-term unemployed if,83
NA,the Labor government have their system for,83
NA,employment services passed by this parliament …,83
NA,Since then we have seen that the numbers of,83
NA,"long-term unemployed have skyrocketed,",83
NA,and they have skyrocketed particularly since,83
NA,the introduction of Job Services Australia in,83
NA,"July 2009. At the moment, the percentage of",83
NA,long-term unemployed as a proportion of the,83
NA,total unemployed is over 20 per cent. That is,83
NA,the highest it has been in at least five years.,83
NA,We have also seen huge increases in the,83
NA,numbers of people who are classified as,83
NA,"long-term unemployed. On the ABS figures,",83
NA,when Labor came to power there were less,83
NA,"than 70,000 Australians who were long-term",83
NA,"unemployed. There are now almost 120,000",83
NA,on the ABS figures. But on the job seeker,83
NA,figures it is even worse than that. On the,83
NA,"figures that I have, in March 2011 there were",83
NA,"179,041 job seekers listed as long-term",83
NA,unemployed.,83
NA,"Now, incredibly, Labor's no-show, no-pay",83
NA,system will not even last two years. It was,83
NA,already obvious that this was a massive,83
NA,failure within a year of them introducing it.,83
NA,"Unbelievably, in the last 12 months there",83
NA,have been approximately two million job,83
NA,"interviews, activities or",83
NA,appointments missed by job seekers with no,83
NA,excuses or with unsatisfactory excuses given.,83
NA,This is yet another example of a government,83
NA,which has lost its way and of a government,83
NA,which has been shown to be completely,83
NA,incompetent in addressing the challenges of,83
NA,unemployment and the challenges of welfare,83
NA,reform. The high rate of missed,83
NA,appointments over the last 12 months is clear,83
NA,evidence that the Labor government's,83
NA,watering down of mutual obligation in 2008,83
NA,"with their no-show, no-pay compliance",83
NA,model did not work.,83
NA,"I do not like, as a rule, to quote from",83
NA,"myself, but in October 2008 I said:",83
NA,The problem with weakening the compliance,83
NA,regime is that it will be much less effective in,83
NA,changing behaviour for the positive. It will,83
NA,become a toothless tiger.,83
NA,And that is why we are here today. When,83
NA,"you hear the government speakers, it is as if",83
NA,"they are saying, 'We have to come in and be",83
NA,tough and get more compliance.' This is a,83
NA,classic example of trying to fix a problem,83
NA,that you have created. This was created by,83
NA,"the Labor Party, by the government and by",83
NA,the incompetence of your ministers. We said,83
NA,"that no show, no pay would not work",83
NA,because there was not enough disincentive.,83
NA,Clearly that is right. There have been more,83
NA,"than two million missed interviews, missed",83
NA,appointments and missed attendances at,83
NA,things like Work for the Dole. This is yet,83
NA,another policy failure from the government.,83
NA,It is a policy failure of their own creation.,83
NA,This bill seeks to correct the government's,83
NA,own failure by reinstating some tougher,83
NA,compliance measures for job seekers with,83
NA,"activity test requirements, and this is a",83
NA,welcome restoration. But it is a totally,83
NA,unnecessary restoration. It is only necessary,83
NA,because the government in their wisdom,83
NA,decided that they would water down mutual,83
NA,obligation-and there are still some,83
NA,"provider problems on that front. Work for the Dole, as",83
NA,"I said, is a hollow shell of what it was. Of the",83
NA,new Job Services Australia structure that was,83
NA,"announced with so much fanfare in 2008-09,",83
NA,much of it has not even survived this year's,83
NA,budget. It has not even gone for three years,83
NA,and already the government have realised,83
NA,that things like the Innovation Fund are not,84
NA,"working, and they have been allowed to fall",84
NA,by the wayside.,84
NA,The opposition welcomes a firm but fair,84
NA,system to ensure that those receiving income,84
NA,support who are capable of working,84
NA,recognise that welfare is a temporary safety,84
NA,net and not a lifestyle choice. On the,84
NA,"specifics of the legislation, in the event of a",84
NA,job seeker failing to attend an appointment or,84
NA,a required activity like Work for the Dole,84
NA,without a reasonable excuse being given in,84
NA,"advance, support payments for that job",84
NA,seeker will be suspended. The onus will then,84
NA,be on the job seeker to attend a rescheduled,84
NA,"appointment, when their payment will be",84
NA,reinstated with back pay. If the job seeker,84
NA,"fails to attend the rescheduled appointment,",84
NA,payment will be suspended indefinitely until,84
NA,"they do attend an appointment, with no back",84
NA,"pay payable. In addition, the reasonable-",84
NA,excuse provisions are also being tightened to,84
NA,ensure that even if there was a reasonable,84
NA,excuse it will not be accepted if they could,84
NA,have given advance notice for not attending.,84
NA,"In closing, I welcome",84
NA,acknowledgement by the government that,84
NA,"their no-show, no-pay compliance system",84
NA,has failed. The results are there for all to,84
NA,"two million missed job interviews,",84
NA,appointments and activities and long-term,84
NA,"unemployment now at 179,000, compared",84
NA,"with 69,900 when Labor came to power. I",84
NA,think it is regrettable that these have been,84
NA,two wasted years for people who are on,84
NA,"welfare, for people who are long-term",84
NA,"unemployed, but I do welcome the",84
NA,acknowledgement by the government that,84
NA,their system has failed. We are now moving,84
NA,"on to Job Services Australia mark 2, and I",84
NA,welcome the changes proposed today to,84
NA,restore tougher compliance measures for job,84
NA,seekers.,84
NA,Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (13:30): I rise,84
NA,to speak in support of the Social Security,84
NA,Legislation Amendment (Job Seeker,84
NA,Compliance) Bill 2011. The task of welfare,84
NA,reform and management is obviously not an,84
NA,"easy one; however, it is one of the very",84
NA,important tasks and activities of this,84
NA,parliament. Welfare and participation,84
NA,payments are fundamental in ensuring that,84
NA,an appropriate social safety net exists in this,84
NA,country. It is the Australian Labor Party that,84
NA,has always recognised the great need for,84
NA,appropriate welfare in our society. It is the,84
NA,Australian Labor Party that has always,84
NA,recognised the need for appropriate,84
NA,participation payments in our society. In,84
NA,"representing my electorate of Robertson, I",84
NA,am mindful that my work in this place,84
NA,"should have a positive, practical impact on",84
NA,not only the lives of those in my electorate,84
NA,but all Australians.,84
NA,The practical considerations of any,84
NA,changes to legislation should be the,84
NA,dominant purpose for the welfare reform that,84
NA,we are undertaking-practical considerations,84
NA,the such as what benefits the Australian,84
NA,"community the most, and what is most",84
NA,beneficial for the long-term economic,84
NA,see: progress of the nation. This bill seeks to,84
NA,provide sensible reform to job seeker,84
NA,compliance. The role of participation,84
NA,payments is to provide welfare for the,84
NA,duration that a person is seeking employment,84
NA,"until they are able to attain it. Indeed, under",84
NA,"the Australian social security system, job",84
NA,seekers are required to actively look for,84
NA,employment when they receive participation,84
NA,payments.,84
NA,This bill delivers on an election,84
NA,commitment that was part of the,84
NA,'Modernising Australia's welfare system',84
NA,package that was announced on 11 August,84
NA,2011. The central component of this bill is,84
NA,the incentive it provides job seekers when,85
NA,they are receiving participation payments.,85
NA,The Social Security Administration Act 1999,85
NA,will be amended to provide for the,85
NA,suspension of a job seeker's income support,85
NA,payment if they fail to attend an appointment,85
NA,or engage in an activity such as training. This,85
NA,provision has the practical effect of,85
NA,providing an incentive for job seekers to,85
NA,attend appointments when required and to,85
NA,participate in activities that will benefit their,85
NA,future prospects of employment.,85
NA,"Under the amendments, the suspension of",85
NA,income support payment will occur after the,85
NA,reporting of an initial failure to attend an,85
NA,"appointment without a reasonable excuse, or",85
NA,a failure to participate in training actives,85
NA,"without a reasonable excuse. Importantly,",85
NA,full income support payments will be,85
NA,restored when the job seeker re-engages with,85
NA,appointments and training requirements. This,85
NA,provides an important incentive for job,85
NA,seekers to comply with the requirements set,85
NA,down in the act. It is also important that,85
NA,these requirements are complied with not,85
NA,just for the benefit of the national economy,85
NA,and the wise expenditure of funds on welfare,85
NA,"payments but also for the financial, social",85
NA,and emotional health of job seekers. Going,85
NA,out each day to look for work and being,85
NA,"knocked back can, I think, sometimes be a",85
NA,very disheartening experience. In the,85
NA,evidence that we heard on this matter during,85
NA,the education and employment inquiry were,85
NA,stories of how critical it was for job seekers,85
NA,to have the engagement with service,85
NA,providers who were able to assist them to,85
NA,"continue that journey, to identify areas that",85
NA,they might need training in and to share the,85
NA,experience of sometimes failure in achieving,85
NA,the jobs that they were after. It is vital that,85
NA,they reconnect and continue to share that,85
NA,"journey towards full employment, which is",85
NA,so important for all Australians. There is so,85
NA,"much to be said for the dignity of work, not",85
NA,just because of the freedom that it gives us,85
NA,and the money that we earn from it and then,85
NA,spend in our own particular way but also,85
NA,because of the connection it gives us with,85
NA,other human beings on a daily basis. People,85
NA,notice when we show up. People notice,85
NA,when we might not be there. Opportunities,85
NA,for care are provided in the workplace in,85
NA,very significant ways. It is not fair that some,85
NA,Australians should miss out on that. The,85
NA,capacity for service providers in this field to,85
NA,help people re-engage should not be,85
NA,"underestimated, and that is why these",85
NA,appointments can be really critical in helping,85
NA,people succeed.,85
NA,"Recently, I was involved in an apprentice",85
NA,"drive by the Central Coast Group Training,",85
NA,and I wrote to over 500 small businesses in,85
NA,the seat of Robertson about it. I am pleased,85
NA,to report that the group training scheme,85
NA,reached its target of employing 30,85
NA,apprentices and trainees within 30 days-in,85
NA,"fact, it exceeded its target. The vast majority",85
NA,of businesses to which I wrote were small,85
NA,businesses. An example of one small,85
NA,business that did employ a trainee from the,85
NA,apprentice drive was Ozone Express,85
NA,Laundrette. I have seen many generations of,85
NA,young people from the Central Coast,85
NA,transition through our vocational education,85
NA,and training system into small business. I can,85
NA,say without hesitation that I am passionate,85
NA,about youth employment in my region.,85
NA,Group training schemes and apprenticeships,85
NA,are vital in reducing the level of youth,85
NA,unemployment. But this of itself is not,85
NA,effective unless tied to the opportunities that,85
NA,can be provided by employment providers,85
NA,who assist particularly young people in,85
NA,getting into work. We need an appropriate,85
NA,system of compliance to encourage job,85
NA,seekers to go out and get on with looking for,85
NA,work.,85
NA,The suspension of payments provides the,85
NA,much needed incentive for some job seekers,85
NA,to re-engage quickly with their employment,86
NA,service provider and then when they do what,86
NA,"is required they will get paid. In a way, this",86
NA,sort of communication with an employment,86
NA,service provider is an opportunity to practise,86
NA,"such skills-for instance, if one of the",86
NA,children is sick or if you are unwell. This is,86
NA,an opportunity for people who might have,86
NA,been out of employment for a long time to,86
NA,practise the skills of managing their life to a,86
NA,point where they are able to make a phone,86
NA,call in advance and connect back in. For,86
NA,people who take that for granted it seems a,86
NA,"small skill, but for people who lose agency",86
NA,and a sense of capacity when they have had a,86
NA,"few knock-backs, this skill can be something",86
NA,"that can fall off. So, obviously, this",86
NA,legislation is going to assist in encouraging,86
NA,people to undertake those common,86
NA,courtesies that are part of participating in a,86
NA,workplace.,86
NA,This bill also reforms the suspension of,86
NA,payments when job seekers continue to fail,86
NA,to comply with job seekers' requirements. If,86
NA,"a job seeker does fail to re-engage, their",86
NA,payment will be suspended pending an,86
NA,agreement to re-engage and they will lose,86
NA,payment for each day after this missed,86
NA,appointment. The payment will only be,86
NA,resumed after they attend a scheduled,86
NA,"reappointment. This bill provides, through",86
NA,"this mechanism, for an early intervention",86
NA,system in the provision of participation,86
NA,payments and compliance with the,86
NA,requirements of engagement in seeking work,86
NA,and attending appointments. The suspension,86
NA,of payment as a result of the initial failure,86
NA,attend an appointment or engage with,86
NA,training can enable problems related to,86
NA,workplace participation to be addressed,86
NA,"early. Additionally, I firmly believe that",86
NA,most appropriate to provide the incentive for,86
NA,actively looking for employment early in the,86
NA,job search period. This enables issues in,86
NA,regards to workplace participation to be,86
NA,managed early. Whilst there must also be,86
NA,"positive incentives in looking for work,",86
NA,penalties need to operate in regards to failing,86
NA,to comply with the requirements attached to,86
NA,the payment. The requirements that affect the,86
NA,provision of a participation payment must be,86
NA,"clear and certain. Under this legislation, the",86
NA,consequences for not attending appointments,86
NA,and activities will be increased in clarity and,86
NA,immediacy and will have a much better,86
NA,effect in terms of helping people make the,86
NA,connection between missing the appointment,86
NA,and then losing their participation payment,86
NA,for that period of time.,86
NA,These reforms to the provision of income,86
NA,support to job seekers cannot be taken,86
NA,"lightly. It is very important to recognise that,",86
NA,if a person has incurred the penalty of a,86
NA,suspended payment for an initial failure to,86
NA,"attend an appointment, payment will be",86
NA,restored with full back payment once the re-,86
NA,engagement occurs. But this legislation does,86
NA,tighten the provisions that enable a,86
NA,reasonable excuse to be provided. The most,86
NA,important change in this regard is that an,86
NA,excuse is not reasonable if a job seeker could,86
NA,have given advance notice but failed to do,86
NA,so.,86
NA,I understand that the incentives that are,86
NA,provided under this legislation only partly,86
NA,address concerns relating to unemployment,86
NA,and workplace participation. The most,86
NA,important means of ensuring that job seekers,86
NA,can find employment is the provision of a,86
NA,strong economy. We saw in the budget last,86
NA,to night the platform for ensuring that,86
NA,Australians get work and keep work and that,86
NA,we grow job opportunities in this country.,86
NA,"Indeed, it was this government that so",86
NA,it is successfully stimulated the economy during,86
NA,the global financial crisis and helped,86
NA,maintain our low level of unemployment. It,86
NA,is this government that continues to work to,87
NA,ensure that unemployment remains low and,87
NA,that job seekers can transition into,87
NA,employment.,87
NA,"Whilst we do this, we also need to ensure",87
NA,that our social security services are,87
NA,modernised and provide the right incentives,87
NA,"to people. As stated, another component of",87
NA,"our response to unemployment, especially",87
NA,"youth unemployment, is to provide access to",87
NA,"training. In this regard, welfare can provide",87
NA,means to a hand up rather than merely a,87
NA,hand-out. The Australian government is well,87
NA,assisted by organisations such as group,87
NA,training schemes in addition to job training,87
NA,networks that assist in the provision of,87
NA,training to job seekers. In last night's budget,87
NA,we saw a very practical and significant,87
NA,"commitment to that. Additionally, we must",87
NA,also acknowledge the good and effective,87
NA,work done by non-government organisations,87
NA,who participate in this field. Mission,87
NA,Australia and the Salvation Army are just,87
NA,two that spring to mind in terms of working,87
NA,to provide employment opportunities for job,87
NA,seekers and working to help job seekers re-,87
NA,form their identity and recover their hopes,87
NA,for participation and the freedom that work,87
NA,offers. These organisations play a great,87
NA,complementary role to the work of,87
NA,government and they engage very effectively,87
NA,with our community and with people who,87
NA,need a bit of a hand every now and then.,87
NA,This legislation is effective,87
NA,modernising our welfare system. It does,87
NA,provide incentives where they are needed,87
NA,and it does provide encouragement to stay,87
NA,within the boundaries of appropriate,87
NA,behaviours that would be replicated in the,87
NA,workplace. Employment participation is,87
NA,fundamental if we wish our economy to be,87
NA,strong and if we want to have a strong,87
NA,society. This is a practical reform. It is not,87
NA,based on ideological rhetoric. It is based,87
NA,practical consideration of the needs of our,87
NA,system of social security. It is practically,87
NA,engaging and it will be practically applicable,87
NA,to ensure that income support payments are,87
NA,appropriately provided. I believe this,87
NA,legislation will contribute to the generation,87
NA,of a culture in which welfare is not seen as a,87
NA,hand-out but as a hand up. It will certainly,87
NA,encourage the young and the old and the,87
NA,people in between who have been,87
NA,disconnected from the workplace into further,87
NA,a engagement with their service provider for,87
NA,the opportunity of jobs that will produce. I,87
NA,commend the legislation to the House.,87
NA,Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:42): I rise,87
NA,to offer my comments on the Social Security,87
NA,Legislation Amendment (Job Seeker,87
NA,Compliance) Bill 2011 by recognising that,87
NA,this is indeed a national issue. This bill aims,87
NA,to introduce tougher compliance measures,87
NA,for job seekers who have activity test,87
NA,requirements. If passed this bill will,87
NA,introduce a suspension of income support,87
NA,payments for job seekers following a failure,87
NA,to attend participation activities including an,87
NA,appointment with the employment services,87
NA,"provider or, in some circumstances, an",87
NA,activity such as training or work for the dole.,87
NA,Unemployment in Australia is currently low,87
NA,at a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.9 per cent,87
NA,"in March 2011, with 179,000-odd job",87
NA,seekers classified as long-term unemployed,87
NA,at the same time. While the latest,87
NA,unemployment figures show that the,87
NA,in Northern Territory unemployment is just,87
NA,over two per cent and is the lowest in the,87
NA,"country, we are losing more people to",87
NA,interstate migration than are being gained. In,87
NA,"my electorate of Solomon, we have a",87
NA,transient population whereby workers will,87
NA,take their skills and trades elsewhere to,87
NA,where they are better paid or if there are no,87
NA,jobs in the Northern Territory for them. In,87
NA,the last month it has been reported in the,87
NA,on a Northern Territory News that this is,87
NA,"happening now, with many skilled and",87
NA,semiskilled workers going to higher paid,88
NA,jobs in Western Australia and Queensland.,88
NA,"Yet, despite such low",88
NA,unemployment rates and jobs being,88
NA,"available, in the last 12 months across",88
NA,Australia approximately two million job,88
NA,interviews and appointments were missed by,88
NA,job seekers with no valid excuse given. Job,88
NA,seekers are required to undertake these,88
NA,"activities as part of their mutual obligation,",88
NA,"yet it is clear, by the high number of missed",88
NA,"appointments nationally, that job seekers are",88
NA,in fact ignoring their obligations. It is critical,88
NA,that these job seekers are encouraged to re-,88
NA,engage with mainstream society and actively,88
NA,seek employment in order to break the cycle,88
NA,of welfare dependency.,88
NA,The coalition requires a fair but firm,88
NA,system to ensure that those in receipt of,88
NA,income support who can work have a,88
NA,responsibility to look for work and,88
NA,contribute back to the society that supports,88
NA,"them. In addition to this, they need to",88
NA,recognise that welfare is a temporary safety,88

NA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,88
NA,Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (13:45): I rise,88
NA,today to express my disappointment for the,88
NA,agricultural industry in the budget. Not only,88
NA,has the government delivered nothing for the,88
NA,industry; it has also failed to alleviate the,88
NA,crippling shortage of skilled workers. With,88
NA,the worst drought in the nation's history at an,88
NA,"end, our agricultural industry is gradually",88
NA,returning to full production. In order to,88
NA,"achieve this, the industry desperately needs",88
NA,skilled workers. The mining boom has been,88
NA,tremendous for the Australian economy but,88
NA,disastrous for Australian agricultural,88
NA,employment. The agricultural sector,88
NA,"national produces fine, hardworking employees who",88
NA,are very attractive to the mining sector and,88
NA,are drawn by generous salaries.,88
NA,"Under Labor's budget commitment, $280",88
NA,million has been provided to boost,88
NA,"apprenticeships, but to be eligible an",88
NA,apprentice must be undertaking a trade that,88
NA,appears on the National Skills Needs List.,88
NA,"Agriculture and horticulture, as part of that,",88
NA,are not included on that list. Agriculture will,88
NA,not be able to return to its prime position as,88
NA,an economic powerhouse of the nation,88
NA,without new generations of skilled,88
NA,tradespeople. The government has no clue,88
NA,when it comes to agriculture; it needs to,88
NA,listen to the industry and include agriculture,88
NA,in its apprenticeship and training program.,88
NA,Australian Export Awards: Pivot,88
NA,Maritime International,88
Mr LYONS ,Bass) (13:46): I am most,88
NA,pleased to congratulate Dr Jeff Hawkins and,88
NA,Dr Luz Hawkins on their recent success in,88
NA,the 49th annual Australian Export Awards.,88
NA,This is the second year running that they,88
NA,have secured a win in the Export Awards.,88
NA,This is a fantastic achievement. Australia's,88
NA,exporters play a pivotal role in the prosperity,88
NA,"Budget and stability of the national economy, with",88
NA,their perseverance and ingenuity creating,88
NA,jobs and new businesses which benefit all of,88
NA,Australia.,88
NA,"Pivot Maritime International, operated by",88
NA,"Luz and Jeff, is a great example of this",88
NA,ingenuity. Its success in international,88
NA,"business deserves recognition, which is why",88
NA,"the International Australian Export Awards,",88
NA,"now in its 49th year, is so important. Pivot",88
NA,Maritime produces maritime simulators for,88
NA,"commercial shipping, recreational boating",88
NA,"and defence. But, unlike its competitors,",88
NA,"Pivot also operates a simulator, employing",88
NA,"its own simulators in its training, consultancy",89
NA,"and research services, and working in close",89
NA,partnership with strategic clients to assist,89
NA,them to make optimal use of their simulators.,89
NA,This strategy ensures the company is,89
NA,continually validating and improving the,89
NA,effectiveness and efficiency of its systems.,89
NA,"Pivot's target markets include the USA, Asia-",89
NA,"Pacific and Europe as well as, of course,",89
NA,Australia. This is a company from Legana in,89
NA,Tasmania. I congratulate Jeff and Luz on,89
NA,their wonderful business in my electorate of,89
NA,Bass. (Time expired),89
NA,Aston Electorate: Volunteering,89
Mr TUDGE ,Aston) (13:48): This week,89
NA,"is National Volunteer Week, so there is no",89
NA,better time than this week to highlight the,89
NA,role of volunteers in our community and to,89
NA,say thank you. Volunteers are the glue that,89
NA,holds together our civil society. Australian,89
NA,volunteers contribute more than 700 million,89
NA,hours of community service each year. Over,89
NA,5.4 million people volunteer in some,89
NA,"capacity each year, a number which has risen",89
NA,from 3.2 million 10 years ago. In my,89
NA,"electorate of Aston over 19,000 people",89
NA,volunteer each year for an organisation or,89
NA,"group, and this does not include many carers",89
NA,or others who volunteer individually. They,89
NA,do a tremendous job and often put in huge,89
NA,"numbers of hours each week, whether it is in",89
NA,"scouts and guides, running the local football",89
NA,and netball clubs or participating in local,89
NA,environment groups or local charities.,89
NA,Last week I had the opportunity to thank,89
NA,some of the volunteers from one of the,89
NA,largest volunteer organisations in my,89
NA,"electorate, Bridges, which was formerly",89
NA,known as Knox Community Volunteers.,89
NA,"Capably led by CEO Mandi Hyland, Bridges",89
NA,"coordinates over 2,000 volunteers to provide",89
NA,"transport, social activities and support for",89
NA,elderly residents in Knox. I would like to,89
NA,again express my thanks to the volunteers at,89
NA,Bridges for their tireless work and to all the,89
NA,volunteers in Knox and Whitehorse. You,89
NA,make our community a better place and I am,89
NA,very proud to be your federal representative.,89
NA,Melbourne Electorate: Carringbush,89
NA,Adult Education Centre,89
Mr BANDT ,Melbourne) (13:50): Last,89
NA,week I visited the Carringbush adult,89
NA,education centre in my electorate of,89
NA,Melbourne. The electorate of Melbourne has,89
NA,the highest number of public housing,89
NA,dwellings of any electorate in the country,89
NA,and the Carringbush centre provides critical,89
NA,learning opportunities for the residents of the,89
NA,Richmond housing estates and the,89
NA,surrounding areas. I learnt a lot from the,89
NA,people I met in Richmond who were engaged,89
NA,in the language and literacy program-their,89
NA,"extraordinary skills, their talents, their desire",89
NA,to live a good and peaceful life here in,89
NA,Australia and also their desire to engage in,89
NA,meaningful work. I also learnt about the,89
NA,"difficulties they encounter securing jobs, the",89
NA,"importance of language, literacy and",89
NA,numeracy classes and their challenges in,89
NA,accessing affordable health and dental care.,89
NA,In yesterday's budget there are some,89
NA,"things that are going to help them, like the",89
NA,beginning of the Greens initiative to put,89
NA,"dental care into Medicare, but unfortunately",89
NA,"they, like many other migrants and refugees",89
NA,"in Australia, have been forgotten. We have,",89
NA,"especially in Melbourne, a wealth of people",89
NA,who have come here from overseas and who,89
NA,have often been living in the country for,89
NA,"many years, with skills, degrees and",89
NA,qualifications that are going unrecognised.,89
NA,"They face barriers to employment, and one",89
NA,of the key ones is language. It is my hope,89
NA,that at some stage the government moves,89
NA,beyond seeing job seekers as people who do,89
NA,not want to work and that instead we begin,89
NA,"supporting these people, especially those",89
NA,"who face language barriers, into meaningful",90
NA,and decent employment in Melbourne.,90
NA,Flinders Electorate: Somerville Police,90
NA,Station,90
Mr HUNT ,"Flinders) (13:51): I rise, on",90
NA,"behalf of the people of Somerville, to",90
NA,welcome the news that the Victorian,90
NA,government has approved the creation of a,90
NA,police station for Somerville. This is overdue,90
NA,"news, it is welcome news, it is important",90
NA,news and it will make a difference to the,90
NA,safety and security of families on the streets,90
NA,of Somerville and within the homes of the,90
NA,residents of Somerville. This has been a,90
NA,longstanding campaign and project. Along,90
NA,"with my state colleague, Neil Burgess,",90
NA,Councillor Lynn Bowden and many others,90
NA,within the community we have held public,90
NA,"meetings, we have had petitions, we have",90
NA,"written letters, we have campaigned hard,",90
NA,and this is a great tribute to the people of,90
NA,Somerville. Stage 1 of the project will be the,90
NA,identification and acquisition of an,90
NA,appropriate plot of land for the Somerville,90
NA,police station by the state government. Stage,90
NA,2 of the project will be the planning of the,90
NA,station in relation to that land. Stage 3 will,90
NA,be the construction and implementation. That,90
NA,project is now underway. The search for,90
NA,"land, the search for an appropriate place for a",90
NA,police station and the acquisition of that land,90
NA,is the task right now. In the meantime we,90
NA,want to work with the community to see that,90
NA,they get the police station they have wanted,90
NA,and the station they have deserved and,90
NA,needed. It is a great tribute and a great,90
NA,outcome to the persistence of the Somerville,90
NA,community. (Time expired),90
NA,Fraser Electorate: Welcoming the,90
NA,Babies,90
Dr LEIGH ,Fraser) (13:53): On 27,90
NA,March this year I held Canberra's inaugural,90
NA,'Welcoming the Babies' event at Stage 88 in,90
NA,"Commonwealth Park. Over 150 mums, dads,",90
NA,"bubs, brothers and sisters enjoyed a perfect",90
NA,Canberra autumn morning while taking the,90
NA,time to engage with local services and other,90
NA,families. As a parent of two young boys,90
NA,"myself, I know the challenging moments that",90
NA,one has in raising a family: endless nappy,90
NA,"changes, throwing food at dinner time and",90
NA,"early wake-ups. For example, my one-year-",90
NA,old arose at 4.15 this morning. That is why I,90
NA,believe it is important to celebrate being a,90
NA,parent and to share survival tips.,90
NA,"I want to thank ACT Playgroups, ACT",90

NA,helping other stallholders. I would also like,90
NA,"to thank Treasurer Wayne Swan, who",90
NA,"pioneered this kind of event, making him 'the",90
NA,father of Welcoming the Babies'. As first-,90
NA,"time dad Tito Hasan told me, 'It's been great",90
NA,to see kids having fun. My wife and I see the,90
NA,range of things out there for first-time,90
NA,parents. I'm looking forward to coming back,90
NA,next year.',90
NA,MCPherson Electorate: Gold Coast,90
NA,Quarry,90
NA,Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (13:54):,90
NA,Boral Resources is pushing ahead with its,90
NA,proposal for a quarry in Tallebudgera Valley,90
NA,"within the electorate of MCPherson, despite",90
NA,significant opposition from local residents as,90
NA,well as the broader Gold Coast community.,90
NA,"My office has been inundated with calls,",90
NA,emails and letters from a community that is,91
NA,outraged over the proposal. So determined is,91
NA,the community to stop the proposed quarry,91
NA,that a community action group called 'Stop,91
NA,the Gold Coast Quarry' has been formed and,91
NA,is actively campaigning against the project.,91
NA,The management committee of 'Stop the,91
NA,Gold Coast Quarry' comprises community,91
NA,"representatives Sam Stewart, Robert",91
NA,"Balanda, Marco Scholten, Lorraine Cook,",91
NA,Niki Naday and Tony Davis. They are united,91
NA,in their determination to stop the proposed,91
NA,quarry.,91
NA,A petition tabled in the Queensland state,91
NA,parliament and essentially asking for the,91
NA,development application to be refused,91
NA,"received over 9,000 signatures. I have",91
NA,attended several community meetings about,91
NA,"this issue, including a recent rally held",91
NA,two weeks ago. This rally alone resulted in,91
NA,"an additional 1,000 signatures for the",91
NA,"petition, gathered in a couple of hours.",91
NA,Residents do not want a quarry in their,91
NA,backyard. They do not want their pristine,91
NA,bushland torn up. They do not want trucks,91
NA,clogging the already congested roads on the,91
NA,southern Gold Coast. They do not want to,91
NA,"listen to the noise from blasting, sirens and",91
NA,crushers. They do not want the value of their,91
NA,property to drop. (Time expired),91
NA,Canberra Electorate: Liz Dawson,91
Ms BRODTMANN ,Canberra) (13:56):,91
NA,Today I rise to honour another Canberra,91
NA,"legend, Liz Dawson. Liz is a tireless and",91
NA,tenacious advocate for the homeless and,91
NA,disadvantaged in the ACT. She is one of the,91
NA,brains and drivers behind the Common,91
NA,Ground project here in Canberra which aims,91
NA,to provide permanent housing and structured,91
NA,co-located services for the homeless and,91
NA,people with drug and alcohol dependency,91
NA,and mental health issues. Until recently Liz,91
NA,also volunteered with the Salvation Army,91
NA,and was relentless in pursuing funding for a,91
NA,dental program for the homeless. Liz is one,91
NA,formidable woman and a great source of,91
NA,inspiration for many women here in,91
NA,Canberra. The side-effects of a recent,91
NA,operation seriously impaired her vision but,91
NA,that has not stopped her in her tracks.,91
NA,"Instead, Liz is now advocating for the",91
NA,visually impaired in addition to the homeless,91
NA,and disadvantaged.,91
NA,"Liz Dawson's resilience, energy and",91
NA,selfless commitment to improving the lives,91
NA,of others are something to behold. She leaves,91
NA,people decades younger in the shade. In this,91
NA,National Volunteers Week and on behalf of,91
NA,"the people of Canberra, particularly the",91
NA,"disempowered, I want to thank Liz Dawson",91
NA,for her significant contribution to our,91
NA,community. I would also like to thank the,91
NA,about thousands of Canberrans who serve their,91
NA,community through volunteering every day.,91
NA,Hasluck Electorate: West Rise,91
NA,Disability Competition,91
Mr WYATT ,Hasluck) (13:57): I stand,91
NA,here today to draw attention to the good,91
NA,work of the West Rise Disability,91
NA,Competition in Kalamunda. West Rise is a,91
NA,competition for intellectually disabled people,91
NA,within Hasluck and Perth's eastern suburbs,91
NA,and is the first such basketball competition of,91
NA,its kind in Western Australia. West Rise,91
NA,brings together over 40 people aged 12 and,91
NA,upwards with an intellectual disability and,91
NA,"teaches them, through sport, skills such as",91
NA,teamwork and commitment and promotes,91
NA,confidence building. It has proven so,91
NA,successful that it has now expanded into two,91
NA,divisions to allow for more specialised,91
NA,coaching. What is so great about this,91
NA,program is that it is often held alongside,91
NA,mainstream competitions and this,91
NA,inclusiveness with non-intellectually,91
NA,impaired people helps make these people,91
NA,feel closer to the community that they live in.,91
NA,None of this would be possible without,92
NA,the hard work and dedication of coach and,92
NA,founder Chris Saligari. Chris works at the,92
NA,highly regarded Kalamunda Senior High,92
NA,School education support centre and saw,92
NA,first-hand the benefits of sport for the,92
NA,intellectually impaired. Despite not having,92
NA,any children or family of her own with a,92
NA,"disability, Chris took time to start this",92
NA,competition and is ably assisted by her son,92
NA,and coach Michael Saligari and coach Ed,92
NA,Thime. I thank Chris for her commitment to,92
NA,helping others and for starting such a,92
NA,wonderful competition in Hasluck for the,92
NA,east metropolitan's intellectually impaired,92
NA,people. I am proud to be their patron.,92
NA,"Rush, Mr Scott",92
NA,NA,92
NA,to acknowledge the great work done by the,92
NA,"Attorney-General, Robert MCClelland, the",92
NA,"foreign minister, Kevin Rudd, and many",92
NA,other members on behalf of Lee and Chris,92
NA,Rush and their son Scott. Lee and Chris are,92
NA,my constituents in Graceville and I want to,92
NA,"commend people like Chris Hayes, the",92
NA,"member for Fowler, for the great work they",92
NA,have done to ensure that Scott has started the,92
NA,journey to being released from prison.,92
NA,Obviously there is a lot more work to be,92
NA,done but at least this is getting him off death,92

The SPEAKER, Order! The time,92
NA,allotted for members' statements has,92
NA,concluded.,92
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,92
NA,Budget,92
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Leader of the,92
NA,Opposition) (14:00): My question is to the,92
NA,Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to,92
NA,the government's $2 billion cut to family,92
NA,"benefits, including for those earning as little",92
NA,"as $45,000 a year, while its spending on the",92
NA,boat people crisis has blown out by $1.75,92
NA,billion. Why is the government tougher on,92
NA,families than it is on border protection?,92
Ms GILLARD ,Lalor-Prime Minister),92
NA,(14:00): I thank the Leader of the,92
NA,Opposition for his question. Let me explain,92
NA,to the Leader of the Opposition the,92
NA,fundamentals of this budget. This budget is,92
NA,bringing the budget back into surplus in,92
NA,"2012-13, as promised. That has meant that",92
NA,we have needed to take a series of tough,92
NA,decisions. We did not want to see in this,92
NA,budget the profligacy of the Howard years,92
NA,"during mining boom mark 1. Consequently,",92
NA,"when you look at this budget, you see an",92
NA,average increase in expenditure of one per,92
NA,"cent, compared with an average increase in",92
NA,expenditure of 3.6 per cent under the,92
NA,Howard government. We are being so,92
NA,rigorous on bringing the budget back to,92
NA,"surplus in 2012-13, exactly as promised,",92
NA,because we are determined to continue to,92
NA,deliver to the Australian people a strong,92
NA,economy which gives them the benefit of,92
NA,"jobs-750,000 created already, with another",92
NA,half a million to be created in the years to,92
NA,"come. So, yes, there have been some tough",92
NA,decisions taken in this budget in relation to,92
NA,savings.,92
NA,On the family payments question that the,92
NA,"Leader of the Opposition raised, let me say",92
NA,what the actual information is.,92
NA,NA,92
NA,order. The Prime Minister was asked a,92
NA,question about the government's spending,92
NA,blow-out on border protection versus its cut,92
NA,for family benefits. She was not asked to,92
NA,give an adjournment speech about the budget,92
NA,in general. She should go back to that point.,92
The SPEAKER, Order! The Manager of,92
NA,Opposition Business will resume his seat.,92
NA,The Prime Minister was talking about that,92
NA,aspect of the question as the Manager of,92
NA,Opposition Business rose. I am not sure,93
NA,whether some comments are sotto voce just,93
NA,"for discussion amongst people, but it might",93
NA,help if people did not speak while I was,93
NA,speaking and then I would not misinterpret it,93
NA,as reflections upon the chair.,93
Ms GILLARD, The Leader of the,93
NA,Opposition asked me about family payments.,93
NA,For the clarification of the House and for the,93
NA,Leader of the Opposition so that he has the,93
NA,accurate information-and I believe that he,93
NA,is under an obligation to make sure that what,93
NA,he says to the Australian people is,93
NA,accurate-family payments will still increase,93
NA,under this budget. All fortnightly rates will,93
NA,still increase for family tax benefits A and B.,93
NA,I understand that the Leader of the,93
NA,Opposition does not want the facts but these,93
NA,"are the facts. For example, on 1 July the",93
NA,maximum rate will increase by $113 per,93
NA,annum for a child between the ages of zero,93
NA,and 12 and by $146 per annum for a child,93
NA,between the ages of 13 and 15. In relation to,93
NA,"family tax benefit B, for the youngest child",93
NA,"under five years of age, per family there is a",93
NA,$95 increase annually; for kids aged between,93
NA,"five and 18 years, $66 annually.",93
NA,This budget honours our commitment to,93
NA,increase payments for the parents of,93
NA,"teenagers, as we said we would during the",93
NA,election campaign. So parents of teenagers,93
NA,on the maximum rate can look forward to an,93
NA,"increase of $4,208 in their family payments",93
NA,if they have a child of 16 to 17 years and,93
NA,"$3,741 if they have a child of 18 to 19 years.",93
NA,They are important figures about family,93
NA,payments in this budget and if the Leader of,93
NA,the Opposition wants to accurately talk about,93
NA,"this budget, he should be referring to those",93
NA,figures.,93
NA,The Leader of the Opposition also raised,93
NA,with me the cost of mandatory detention and,93
NA,continuing to process asylum seekers. I,93
NA,support mandatory detention. I believe it is,93
NA,an appropriate policy to check people who,93
NA,come to this country unauthorised-to check,93
NA,"their health, to check their security status and",93
NA,to process their claims. So we will continue,93
NA,to fund mandatory detention because it is the,93
NA,right thing to do. We will continue with the,93
NA,Malaysia agreement which has been the,93
NA,subject of discussion in this House this week,93
NA,and which was announced by me and the,93
NA,Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on,93
NA,Saturday. It is a big blow for people-,93
NA,smugglers and aimed at breaking the people-,93
NA,smugglers' business model. It is the right,93
NA,thing to do. It is better than a three-word,93
NA,slogan.,93
NA,Budget,93
NA,Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell),93
NA,(14:05): My question is to the Treasurer.,93
NA,Will the Treasurer outline to the House what,93
NA,last night's budget says about Australia's,93
NA,economic performance and prospects?,93
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,93
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:06): I thank the,93
NA,member for Dobell for that question. The,93
NA,budget I handed down last night reaffirms,93
NA,Australia's record as one of the best,93
NA,performing developed economies in the,93
NA,global economy. We have strong growth,93
NA,"prospects, we have strong job creation and",93
NA,we are getting the budget back in the black in,93
NA,record time.,93
NA,We have avoided in this country the very,93
NA,high rates of unemployment that have,93
NA,occurred in other advanced economies and,93
NA,we have avoided the crippling levels of debt,93
NA,that we have seen in other advanced,93
NA,economies. We have a budget bottom line,93
NA,which is indeed the envy of the developed,93
NA,world and levels of deficit and debt which,93
NA,"are the envy of the developed world but,",93
NA,"despite this strength, we know there has been",93
NA,short-term softness. We know that parts of,93
NA,our country have been badly affected by,93
NA,"natural disasters, and we know that many",93
NA,parts of the economy still feel the overhang,94
NA,of the global financial crisis and the global,94
NA,"recession, which is also weighing very",94
NA,heavily on government revenues. And of,94
NA,course there are many businesses out there,94
NA,that are certainly struggling under the weight,94
NA,of the high dollar.,94
NA,But against all of this we know that we,94
NA,have a very big investment pipeline in,94
NA,Australia. We are going to go through an,94
NA,"investment boom, with business investment",94
NA,set to reach 50-year highs in the years ahead.,94
NA,That is why we are forecasting growth of,94
NA,four per cent in 2011-12 and 3¾ per cent in,94
NA,2012-13. And that is why we are forecasting,94
NA,"unemployment to come down to 4.5 per cent,",94
NA,because at the core of this budget is our,94
NA,"commitment to jobs, jobs and more jobs.",94
NA,That is our commitment. It is not a,94
NA,commitment that was shared by those,94
NA,opposite during the global financial crisis,94
NA,and the global recession. If they had had,94
NA,"their way, unemployment in this country",94
NA,would be far higher and deficits and debt,94
NA,would be far higher.,94
NA,So we are very optimistic about the future,94
NA,"of our economy, because we can now build",94
NA,on the strength of our economy as we come,94
NA,through the global recession. That is why the,94
NA,"budget gets us back in the black, gets more",94
NA,"Australians into better jobs, gives more help",94
NA,"to families and, particularly-something we",94
NA,are all proud of on this side of the House-,94
NA,invests in mental health. So the budget is,94
NA,about laying down an economic blueprint for,94
NA,the future so we can succeed in the Asian,94
NA,century and maximise the opportunities for,94
NA,our children and our grandchildren.,94
NA,Budget,94
Mr ABBOTT ,Warringah-Leader of the,94
NA,Opposition) (14:09): My question is again to,94
NA,the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister,94
NA,confirm that the budget allocates $13.7,94
NA,million for a carbon tax advertising,94
NA,campaign? How can the budget include,94
NA,propaganda for a carbon tax but not the,94
NA,carbon tax itself?,94
Ms GILLARD ,Lalor-Prime Minister),94
NA,(14:09): To the Leader of the Opposition I,94
NA,say: how quickly they forget. Many may,94
NA,think I am referring to the Work Choices,94
NA,"advertising campaign, an obscenity overseen",94
NA,by the Leader of the Opposition and the,94
NA,"shadow Treasurer, but actually I am referring",94
NA,"to last year's budget papers, because the",94
NA,climate change line item he is referring to,94
NA,appeared in last year's budget papers and has,94
NA,been brought forward into this year's budget,94
NA,papers. So can I say to the Leader of the,94
NA,"Opposition, before he starts making",94
NA,inflammatory claims about where line items,94
NA,"in the budget have come from, that he should",94
NA,perhaps do some budget study. That,94
NA,allocation for the climate change fund was,94
NA,standing in the last budget.,94
NA,On the question of memory: the Leader of,94
NA,the Opposition of course was a very senior,94
NA,minister in the Howard government and he,94
NA,may recall the goods and services tax. He,94
NA,"may also recall that the then Prime Minister,",94
NA,"John Howard, announced that a full two",94
NA,years before he accounted for it in the budget,94
NA,papers. One can only assume from the,94
NA,reaction of the Leader of the Opposition that,94
NA,each and every day of those two years he,94
NA,was running around to the Prime Minister's,94
NA,"office saying to John Howard, 'I just can't",94
NA,bear it; I can't continue to serve as a minister,94
NA,while this isn't accounted for in the budget.',94
NA,Does anybody really think that is what,94
NA,"happened? Well, no, that is not what",94
NA,"happened, because of course the Leader of",94
NA,the Opposition is always keen to apply a,94
NA,standard to others that he does not apply to,94
NA,himself.,94
NA,Let us get to the basis of this question.,95
NA,is because the Leader of the Opposition,95
NA,would prefer to come into this parliament,95
NA,and continue his climate change fear,95
NA,campaign than deal with the matters in the,95
NA,budget. He does not care about a strong,95
NA,economy; he has got no policies or plans for,95
NA,one. He does not care about bringing the,95
NA,budget back to surplus; he has got an $11,95
NA,billion black hole on his side of the ledger.,95
NA,He does not care about the creation of,95
NA,employment in our nation; he has got no,95
NA,policies or plans that relate to creating,95
NA,employment. He does not care about the,95
NA,future of our healthcare system; when he had,95
NA,"the opportunity, he ripped $1 billion out of",95
NA,public hospitals. He does not care about the,95
NA,"future of our schools, because he went to the",95
NA,last election promising to rip the best part,95
NA,$3 billion out of Australian schools. He does,95
NA,"not care about Australian apprenticeships,",95
NA,because he went to the last election,95
NA,promising a $2 billion cut to apprentices.,95
NA,So there is no mystery that the Leader of,95
NA,the Opposition does not come into this place,95
NA,to debate the budget. He cannot and he will,95
NA,"not, because he is a big risk to the budget",95
NA,the nation's economic future-a risky,95
NA,approach taken every day. Every big call,95
NA,required of a leader in this nation he has got,95
NA,"wrong, most particularly the calls necessary",95
NA,for the global financial crisis and keeping,95
NA,people in work. We will continue to get the,95
NA,"big calls right, we will continue to manage",95
NA,the budget and get it back into surplus and,95
NA,we will continue to prioritise the jobs of,95
NA,"Australians, because this budget is centrally",95
NA,about jobs and opportunity for Australians,95
NA,right around the nation-and the Leader of,95
NA,the Opposition has just turned his back on,95
NA,that.,95
NA,Budget,95
NA,Ms O'NEILL (Robertson) (14:13): My,95
NA,question is to the Prime Minister. How will,95
NA,It the budget deliver on the government's,95
NA,commitment to return to surplus and help,95
NA,families with the cost of living?,95
Ms GILLARD ,Lalor-Prime Minister),95
NA,(14:13): I thank the member for her,95
NA,question. On delivering our fiscal prudence,95
NA,"in this budget, the statistics are there for all",95
NA,"to see. As promised, we will return the",95
NA,budget to surplus in 2012-13-back in the,95
NA,"black, just as we promised the Australian",95
NA,people. We will do that because the,95
NA,important thing to assist Australians as our,95
NA,economy moves towards full capacity is to,95
NA,make sure that the government is not adding,95
NA,to inflationary pressures. That is why we are,95
NA,determined to run such a tight spending,95
NA,policy. That is why across the forward,95
NA,estimates you are seeing growth in spending,95
NA,of on average at one per cent. The last time that,95
NA,occurred in Australia was in 1988 e have,95
NA,delivered a year with a negative in front of,95
NA,"increasing growth-that is, spending will go",95
NA,backwards. The Howard government never,95
NA,delivered a year of spending reduction.,95
NA,"Rather, they delivered spending growth in",95
NA,excess of three per cent on average even at,95
NA,and the top of resources boom mark I. The best,95
NA,thing we can do to assist families with cost-,95
NA,of-living pressures is to keep our economy,95
NA,strong and to bring the budget to surplus so,95
NA,as to not add to inflationary pressures which,95
NA,would then feed into the cost of living for,95
NA,working families.,95
NA,But we can do some things as well to,95
NA,"directly assist working families, to assist",95
NA,"families under cost of living pressure, and in",95
NA,this budget we have. We are assisting,95
NA,families with teenagers. Our family payment,95
NA,system has made the old-fashioned,95
NA,assumption that somehow kids leave school,95
NA,when they are very young. We are in a,95
NA,modern economy-we need them to stay in,95
NA,school. So families with teenagers will get,95
NA,special new benefits.,95
NA,For some of our lower income working,96
NA,"Australians, we have pulled forward the low-",96
NA,income tax offset so they can benefit week,96
NA,by week from the money from that low,96
NA,income tax offset to take a little bit of,96
NA,pressure off and to more clearly demonstrate,96
NA,to people the rewards of work. We have in,96
NA,this budget honoured our commitment to,96
NA,include school uniforms in the education tax,96
NA,refund because we want to assist families,96
NA,with the costs of getting kids to school. We,96
NA,have in this budget honoured our,96
NA,commitment to enable families to get their,96
NA,"childcare payments fortnightly, because we",96
NA,understand that that too will provide a,96
NA,cost of living relief.,96
NA,We understand that right around the,96
NA,nation there are families battling cost-of-,96
NA,living pressures. As a government we will be,96
NA,"working with them, doing what we need to",96
NA,"do to keep our economy strong, to keep",96
NA,"people in jobs and employment, to make sure",96
NA,they have decent working conditions when,96
NA,they are there-which is why we got rid of,96
NA,Work Choices-and to provide targeted,96
NA,relief in a budget that will get us back into,96
NA,black exactly as promised.,96
NA,Budget,96
Mr HOCKEY ,North Sydney) (14:16):,96
NA,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the,96
NA,Treasurer to his own budget papers which,96
NA,state that a drop of just four per cent in,96
NA,Australia's terms of trade would wipe out the,96
NA,government's projected surplus in two years,96
NA,"time. Treasurer, if Labor ever delivers its",96
NA,"first surplus in 21 years, will it not be a",96
NA,surplus made in China and not made in,96
NA,Australia?,96
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,96
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:17):,96
NA,shadow Treasurer is proof that hot air is not,96
NA,an economic policy. The fact is that we are,96
NA,"bringing this budget back into the black, we",96
NA,"are doing it by making savings, we are doing",96
NA,it in 2012-13 and we are doing it despite the,96
NA,opposition's fiscal vandalism and their,96
NA,refusal to support responsible savings. Fair,96
NA,dinkum! The shadow Treasurer was on,96
NA,television last night. He said on the one hand,96
NA,that it was too tough and on the other hand,96
NA,that we are not spending enough. This,96
NA,shadow Treasurer walks both sides of the,96
NA,street all the time. The fact is that we will,96
NA,come back to surplus because this,96
NA,government has done the hard yards. We,96
NA,have put in place the spending restraints that,96
NA,those opposite were not capable of,96
NA,bit of exercising during their 12 years in,96
NA,government. We have average spending each,96
NA,year over the budget estimates increasing by,96
NA,"just one per cent. When they were in power,",96
NA,it was increasing by 3.7 per cent. They went,96
NA,on a spending spree at the height of mining,96
NA,boom Mark I. We are doing the hard yards of,96
NA,bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-,96
NA,13 by making $22 billion worth of savings,96
NA,and putting in place one of the biggest fiscal,96
NA,consolidations or returns to surplus that we,96
NA,have seen in this country.,96
NA,The shadow Treasurer quotes some,96
NA,sensitivity analysis from the budget papers.,96
NA,That is not the central forecast in the budget,96
NA,papers and he seeks to misrepresent it. He,96
NA,seeks to misrepresent it for political,96
NA,purposes. We will come back to surplus in,96
NA,"2012-13, because that is the central forecast",96
NA,that we have from the advisers who work,96
NA,both with them as forecasters and with us as,96
NA,forecasters. We are doing it despite the fact,96
NA,that there have been substantial revenue,96
NA,write-downs. We are doing it because we,96
NA,have shown the strict fiscal discipline to,96
NA,"bring our budget back to surplus, a discipline",96
NA,The that those on that side of the House simply,96
NA,do not understand.,96
NA,We are coming back to surplus and we are,97
NA,doing it in a responsible way with a very,97
NA,strict fiscal policy and we will do it in 2012-,97
NA,13. We will build surpluses after that and we,97
NA,will continue to apply our two per cent cap.,97
NA,There is a stark difference between the,97
NA,approach of us on this side of the House and,97
NA,the approach of those opposite. What they,97
NA,want to do in reality is to wreck the surplus.,97
NA,"If they succeeded in wrecking the surplus,",97
NA,they would put price pressures into the,97
NA,Australian economy and all Australians,97
NA,would be the victims of that.,97
Mr HOCKEY ,North Sydney) (14:20):,97
NA,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question.",97
NA,I refer to the Treasurer's statement that the,97
NA,coalition was reckless with its spending,97
NA,"during its term of government. Treasurer,",97
NA,will you confirm that at no stage over the,97
NA,next four years will this government get,97
NA,spending as low as it was in the last year of,97
NA,"the coalition, at 22.9 per cent of GDP?",97
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,97
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:20): You have,97
NA,to give him points for trying. Our forecasts,97
NA,this budget show the fastest fiscal,97
NA,consolidation in history and $22 billion,97
NA,worth of savings. The reason we are in a,97
NA,position to come back to surplus in 2012-13,97
NA,is that we moved to support our economy,97
NA,during the global financial crisis and the,97
NA,global recession. If they had been in charge,97
NA,"during that period, deficits would be far",97
NA,higher and debt would be far higher right,97
NA,now. Our deficits and debt are lower than,97
NA,one-tenth of the levels elsewhere in the,97
NA,advanced world because of the courageous,97
NA,decisions we on this side of the House took,97
NA,to support our economy. The consequence of,97
NA,that is that there is low unemployment in,97
NA,"Australia at 4.9 per cent, going down to 4.5",97
NA,"per cent. If they had been in charge, the",97
NA,starting point of the budget would have been,97
NA,higher deficits and higher debt. What we are,97
NA,doing now is bringing our spending down,97
NA,through a very strict cap.,97
Mr Hockey," Mr Speaker, I rise on a",97
NA,point of order. My question was very,97
NA,specific. Will the Treasurer indicate where in,97
NA,the budget papers-anywhere-does this,97
NA,government get spending down to that in the,97
NA,last year of the Howard government?,97
The SPEAKER, The Treasurer will,97
NA,directly relate his response to the question.,97
Mr SWAN, We are controlling spending,97
NA,in a way which the Howard government was,97
NA,completely and utterly incapable of doing.,97
NA,"The spending increases over their period,",97
NA,"during the boom and over a five-year period,",97
NA,were 3.7. For us it is one per cent. That is all,97
NA,the evidence you need.,97
NA,Budget,97
Mr BANDT ,Melbourne) (14:23): My,97
NA,question is to the Treasurer. Our minerals,97
NA,"belong to all Australians, yet much of the",97
NA,profit disappears overseas and the mining,97
NA,boom places burdens on the rest of the,97
NA,"in economy, where most people live and work.",97
NA,My own state of Victoria must compete with,97
NA,"the miners for labour and capital, pushing up",97
NA,costs and restraining infrastructure,97
NA,"investment. Despite this, the mining sector",97
NA,gets a big leg up in your budget on top of,97
NA,their free kick on the mining tax. Where is,97
NA,the plan for those sectors of the economy,97
NA,that are doing it tough at the moment,97
NA,because of the mining boom? Where is the,97
NA,plan for a sovereign wealth fund that can,97
NA,secure our economy after the boom is over?,97
NA,"And, why are the priorities of the new",97
NA,"economy, like building a smart electricity",97
NA,"grid for clean energy, being slashed while",97
NA,the mining giants get a corporate tax cut and,97
NA,more taxpayer funded support?,97
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,97
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:23): I thank the,97
NA,member for Melbourne for his question,97
NA,because at the very core of the budget,97
NA,delivered last night is a plan to spread the,98
NA,opportunities of the mining boom to every,98
NA,corner of our country and to every postcode,98
NA,in our country. We are responding to the,98
NA,challenges posed by the mining boom which,98
NA,mean that some parts of the economy are,98
NA,stronger than others. And they mean that,98
NA,there will be a patchwork economy out there.,98
NA,Many small businesses and many towns,98
NA,which are not in the fast lane coming from,98
NA,the mining boom will face challenges,98
NA,because of this very strong investment phase,98
NA,into which we are entering. That lies at the,98
NA,very core of all the propositions put forward,98
NA,in the budget last night and goes to the very,98
NA,core of why the government put in place the,98
NA,"mining resource rent tax, which will provide",98
NA,a stream of revenue to enable us to spread,98
NA,the opportunities of the boom to every,98
NA,of our country and to every postcode. That,98
NA,revenue-opposed by those opposite who,98
NA,have the ridiculous proposition that that,98
NA,somehow the mining companies are paying,98
NA,"too much tax-will, first of all, mean that",98
NA,Australians get fair value for the minerals,98
NA,"they own 100 per cent and, secondly, to give",98
NA,a helping hand and a lift up to those sectors,98
NA,of the patchwork economy that are not in the,98
NA,fast lane. So the revenue we are using from,98
NA,the mineral resource rent tax goes to invest,98
NA,"in infrastructure, particularly in mining",98
NA,regions. That is very important,98
NA,"economically. Also, we are going to assist",98
NA,those on low incomes with additional,98
NA,superannuation for all workers whose,98
NA,"income is under something like $37,000. The",98
NA,member asked: what do we think about a,98
NA,sovereign wealth fund? With our,98
NA,superannuation accounts we have eight,98
NA,million of them in this country-a creation,98
NA,of far-sighted Labor governments which,98
NA,"understood that we need, as a country, to",98
NA,save more. We want to boost in the,98
NA,superannuation savings of low-income,98
NA,workers in our community. And remarkably,98
NA,that is opposed by those opposite.,98
NA,The other thing we want to do-and this is,98
NA,really important-is give some tax breaks to,98
NA,small business. With the revenue from the,98
NA,minerals resource rent tax we want to give a,98
NA,"tax cut to small business, spreading it right",98
NA,around the country. It is very important to,98
NA,"give that $5,000 instant asset write-off to",98
NA,small business because that really assists,98
NA,small business with their cash flow. In the,98
NA,budget last night we announced an addition,98
NA,when we said we would allow businesses to,98
NA,"write-off the first $5,000 in the purchase of a",98
NA,vehicle like a ute. That will help a lot of,98
NA,contractors out there who are not in the fast,98
NA,lane and a whole lot of those tradies. We,98
NA,have a comprehensive plan to deal with the,98
NA,"corner patchwork economy, to deal with the",98
NA,challenges that come from mining boom,98
NA,"mark II, to spread the opportunities of it right",98
NA,"around the country, not just with the",98
NA,opportunities coming from the resource rent,98
NA,tax but also in the skilling of our workforce,98
NA,because we need people in every corner and,98
NA,every postcode of this country to be the,98
NA,beneficiaries and the participants in the,98
NA,mining boom. All of the initiatives in the,98
NA,budget are aimed at that.,98
NA,Budget,98
Ms BIRD ,Cunningham) (14:27): My,98
NA,question is to the Treasurer. Will the,98
NA,Treasurer outline the importance of,98
NA,delivering a fiscally responsible budget and,98
NA,how Australia compares internationally?,98
NA,How is this approach being received and,98
NA,what is the government's response?,98
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,98
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:27): I thank the,98
NA,member for Cunningham for her question,98
NA,because we are seeing the quickest return to,98
NA,surplus on record and that is occurring well,98
NA,ahead of comparable countries. Countries,98
NA,"like the United States, the United Kingdom,",99
NA,Germany and Canada will not even have,99
NA,halved their deficits of a share of GDP by,99
NA,"2013. In 2013, the major advanced",99
NA,economies will still be in collective deficit,99
NA,around five per cent of GDP and of course,99
NA,Australia will be back in the black. As I was,99
NA,"saying before, we are doing that because we",99
NA,have put in place the essential savings-$22,99
NA,"billion worth of savings, two-thirds of those",99
NA,spending cuts. We are seeing the fastest,99
NA,fiscal consolidation on record.,99
NA,I have seen some of the statements from,99
NA,those opposite but there has also been a,99
NA,number of statements from the market,99
NA,economists and the rating agencies. This is,99
NA,what the credit rating agency Standard &,99
NA,Poors said:,99
NA,The deficits and additional borrowings do,99
NA,alter the sound profile of Australia's public,99
NA,finances which remain among the strongest of,99
NA,peer group.,99
NA,Mr Blythe from the Commonwealth Bank,99
NA,said:,99
NA,The Budget meets all the requirements of the,99
NA,government‘s medium-term fiscal strategy … Our,99
NA,judgement is that this Budget largely delivers,99
NA,what is required from a short-term cyclical,99
NA,perspective. And it represents a step forward,99
NA,setting up the economy for the longer haul.,99
NA,That is the correct analysis of what we have,99
NA,done. We have the right fiscal settings for the,99
NA,future: bringing the budget back to surplus in,99
NA,2012-13 and making sure we do not,99
NA,compound the inflationary pressures that will,99
NA,come from the mining boom.,99
NA,"Of course, the shadow Treasurer has",99
NA,promised to bring the budget back into,99
NA,surplus next year. So everybody in this,99
NA,House is waiting with bated breath to see the,99
NA,Leader of the Opposition come into this,99
NA,House tomorrow night and indicate how he,99
NA,is going to bring the budget back to surplus,99
NA,next year. I would not be too optimistic,99
NA,"about his chances of that because, as we all",99
NA,"know, following the last election the",99
NA,Treasury and the Department of Finance and,99
NA,Deregulation had a look at their savings and,99
NA,found there was an $11 billion hole in their,99
NA,of savings. We look forward to seeing how they,99
NA,are going to bring forward the savings to,99
NA,bring this budget back to surplus. I think they,99
NA,have already said in the media in the last,99
NA,couple of days that they are opposing,99
NA,something like $3 billion worth of savings.,99
NA,So they are going to start a long way behind.,99
NA,We are all waiting with bated breath to see,99
NA,how the Leader of the Opposition is going to,99
NA,bring the budget back to surplus in the next,99
NA,year. Failure to do so will prove that all they,99
NA,are full of is hot air.,99
NA,Budget,99
NA,WYATT ROY (Longman) (14:30): My,99
NA,not question is to the Treasurer. I am about to,99
NA,turn 21. No Labor government in this place,99
NA,its has ever delivered a budget surplus in my,99
NA,lifetime. Why should anyone believe you,99
NA,now?,99
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,99
The SPEAKER, The House will come to,99
NA,order!,99
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,99
NA,in Minister and Treasurer) (14:31): I thank the,99
NA,member for Longman for that question,99
NA,because under our youth allowance changes,99
NA,he would have to keep studying and not go,99
NA,on the dole. This is because we have a,99
NA,fundamental commitment to learn or earn as,99
NA,part of the participation initiatives we have,99
NA,put in place in this budget. So we have a,99
NA,fundamental commitment to a range of,99
NA,initiatives in participation and skills. We,99
NA,have a fundamental participation agenda,99
NA,which makes sure that people have the,99
NA,opportunity to participate in the workforce,99
NA,and make a significant contribution to our,99
NA,country.,99
NA,It is a very serious question. We will come,99
NA,back to surplus in 2012-13 because we have,99
NA,put in place very strict fiscal discipline-the,100
NA,fastest fiscal consolidation that we have seen,100
NA,on record. We have put forward $22 billion,100
NA,worth of savings and our record stands in,100
NA,stark contrast to those opposite.,100
NA,Budget,100
Mr MITCHELL ,MCEwen) (14:33): My,100
NA,question is to the Prime Minister. How will,100
NA,the budget help keep our economy strong,100
NA,and deliver more jobs for Australia?,100
Ms GILLARD ,Lalor-Prime Minister),100
NA,(14:33): I thank the member for MCEwen,100
NA,for his question.,100
NA,An opposition member: It is a hard one.,100
Ms GILLARD, I do thank the member,100
NA,for MCEwen for his question because I,100
NA,"know, unlike those interjecting, that he is",100
NA,deeply concerned about Australians having,100
NA,the benefits and dignity of work. The story of,100
NA,this budget is a story of getting the budget,100
NA,"back into surplus, as our economy requires",100
NA,as it moves towards full capacity. We will,100
NA,"get the budget back into surplus in 2012-13,",100
NA,exactly as promised. It is the right thing to,100
NA,by the economy and it is the right thing to do,100
NA,by families facing cost of living pressures.,100
NA,But the story of this budget is also a story,100
NA,of jobs and opportunity. We believe in the,100
NA,benefits and dignity of work. We believe for,100
NA,Australians that a life of opportunity starts by,100
NA,"having access to a job, and then by having",100
NA,access to skills and training and the means,100
NA,and wherewithal to get a better job-to get,100
NA,the next job and to keep progressing across,100
NA,their working lives. That is why when you,100
NA,look at the measures we have focused on in,100
NA,"this budget, in circumstances where we have",100
NA,"kept growth in spending so low, we have had",100
NA,to make tough choices but we have,100
NA,deliberately prioritised those things that go,100
NA,give Australians a life of opportunity.,100
NA,With the resources boom coming into full,100
NA,"swing, and with unemployment moving",100
NA,"down to 4.5 per cent, we have a historic",100
NA,opportunity to make a difference in long-,100
NA,term disadvantage in this country and to,100
NA,reach out to those Australians who are on the,100
NA,"margins of Australia's life, who are on",100
NA,welfare and who do not have the benefits and,100
NA,"dignity of work in their lives. That is, of",100
NA,"course, about a pay packet and the choices",100
NA,"that a pay packet gives you in your life, but it",100
NA,is also about the sense of self-worth and self-,100
NA,dignity-the personal connections and self-,100
NA,esteem that comes from having a job. We,100
NA,believe in the benefits and dignity of work.,100
NA,That is why we are so proud of having,100
NA,"created 750,000 jobs and why we are proud",100
NA,that another half a million jobs will be,100
NA,created in the next two years. It is why we,100
NA,are so proud in this budget of the $3 billion,100
NA,skills package to give people new,100
NA,opportunities to get the skills they need to,100
NA,"get their first job, to train again and to get a",100
NA,"better job. Of course, the skills package",100
NA,do comes with a profound reform agenda so that,100
NA,our training system can meet the needs of a,100
NA,"modern economy, meet the needs of modern",100
NA,learners and meet the needs of our industries,100
NA,and businesses that most need access to skills,100
NA,during this phase of our economic growth.,100
NA,This Labor budget comes with particular,100
NA,care and concern for those Australians who,100
NA,have been outside the mainstream of,100
NA,economic life: the very long-term,100
NA,"unemployed, people with disability who can",100
NA,"and want to work, single mums with teenage",100
NA,kids who need to get back into the,100
NA,workforce-a lifetime with a pay packet in,100
NA,front of them. These are Australians for,100
NA,whom we have shown care and concern.,100
NA,"to Yes, we have asked people to step up to new",100
NA,responsibilities and we have met that step-up,100
NA,with new opportunities to get people into,100
NA,work so that they can have a life and a life,100
NA,chance. This is a Labor budget through and,101
NA,through-delivered in the economic,101
NA,circumstances that the nation needs now and,101
NA,delivered by me as Prime Minister with,101
NA,Treasurer Wayne Swan and our economic,101
NA,team informed by Labor values which centre,101
NA,on giving people the simple opportunity of a,101
NA,job.,101
Mr HOCKEY ,North Sydney) (14:37):,101
NA,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the,101
NA,Treasurer to the fact that next year's budget,101
NA,deficit will blow out $10 billion despite,101
NA,in unemployment and stronger economic,101
NA,growth. I also refer the Treasurer to the fact,101
NA,that next year the government is spending,101
NA,$2.2 billion more than it is saving which will,101
NA,make the deficit bigger not smaller. Why is,101
NA,the government making it more likely that,101
NA,the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates in,101
NA,the next 12 months by its own actions of,101
NA,running a bigger deficit and bigger spending,101
NA,in an economy that is growing faster?,101
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,101
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:38): I thank the,101
NA,shadow Treasurer for his question. The fact,101
NA,is that over the forward estimates we are,101
NA,saving $5 billion more than we will spend,101
NA,"and, as I was indicating before, we will put",101
NA,in place the biggest fiscal consolidation-,101
NA,"that is, return to surplus-we have seen since",101
NA,there have been records. We are applying a,101
NA,very strict fiscal discipline and not only will,101
NA,we do it across the forward estimates but we,101
NA,have indicated we will continue to do it until,101
NA,surpluses get back to one per cent of GDP.,101
NA,The member for North Sydney goes on,101
NA,about the deficit this year and the deficit,101
NA,year. It is very clear from all of the budget,101
NA,papers that we have had very substantial,101
NA,"revenue write-downs, $16 billion worth of",101
NA,revenue write-downs over both of those,101
NA,years. That is what has contributed to the,101
NA,"increased deficits in those years. Of course,",101
NA,the cause has been the global financial crisis,101
NA,"and the global recession, and the other cause",101
NA,"has been the natural disasters in Queensland,",101
NA,which have had a dramatic impact on,101
NA,"growth, particularly this year. But the",101
NA,"opposition, as usual, must have slept through",101
NA,"the global financial crisis, the global",101
NA,recession and the natural disasters in,101
NA,"Budget Queensland, because they will never",101
NA,acknowledge the impact of those events on,101
NA,our budget line. They never want to,101
NA,acknowledge that impact because they know,101
NA,"that, had they been in power during that",101
NA,"a fall period, they would not have moved to do",101
NA,what we did. Deficits and debt would be far,101
NA,higher right now and unemployment would,101
NA,be far higher now had they had been in,101
NA,charge of our economy during that period.,101
NA,The member for North Sydney asked me,101
NA,about interest rates. I refer him to the,101
NA,statement on monetary policy issued by the,101
NA,"Reserve Bank last Friday, which points out",101
NA,that the government is running a tight fiscal,101
NA,policy. It pointed that out and everyone can,101
NA,see it in the budget papers. If you go to the,101
NA,"analysts, the market economists and all the",101
NA,"rating agencies, they have all commented on",101
NA,the fact that the government are,101
NA,implementing its medium-term fiscal,101
NA,strategy on time. We are doing it and we are,101
NA,"doing it successfully, and we are doing it",101
NA,because we have applied ourselves to a very,101
NA,strict fiscal discipline-not a fiscal discipline,101
NA,that those opposite applied when they were,101
NA,in government. I was asked a question about,101
NA,spending. Our spending will get down to,101
NA,"23.5 per cent of GDP, and that is lower than",101
NA,the average when those opposite were in,101
NA,"next government, bar for one year.",101
NA,Budget,101
Mr LYONS ,Bass) (14:40): My question,101
NA,is to the Minister for Mental Health and,101
NA,Ageing. How is the government delivering,101
NA,on its commitment to make mental health a,102
NA,priority in this term of government?,102
Mr BUTLER ,Port Adelaide-Minister,102
NA,for Mental Health and Ageing) (14:41): I,102
NA,thank the member for Bass for his question.,102
NA,For months now Australians have been,102
NA,saying that they want their nation to do better,102
NA,in mental health. The Prime Minister has,102
NA,"said, 'For the nation to do better, we need to",102
NA,do more as a national government.' This,102
NA,budget delivers on the Prime Minister's,102
NA,commitment to make mental health reform a,102
NA,priority for this term of government. The,102
NA,budget delivers the largest ever mental health,102
NA,reform package with over $2.2 billion in new,102
NA,"measures, including more than $1.5 million",102
NA,announced last night and more than $600,102
NA,million announced over the course of the last,102
NA,12 months. Combined with our additional,102
NA,investments in mental health subacute beds,102
NA,through the Health and Hospitals Fund and,102
NA,"in the psychiatric workforce, the total",102
NA,commitment by the Gillard government in,102
NA,mental health tops $2.5 billion over five,102
NA,years.,102
NA,We have listened closely to the voices of,102
NA,millions of Australians who live with mental,102
NA,"illness and their families, their carers",102
NA,"course, the experts. This package takes",102
NA,action on their advice and I am glad to report,102
NA,it has been warmly welcomed across the,102
NA,sector and across the broader community.,102
NA,The package recognises the diverse impact,102
NA,of mental illness across a lifetime. It will,102
NA,build resilient kids. It will support teenagers,102
NA,dealing with the challenge of emerging,102
NA,mental illness. It will improve access to basic,102
NA,primary-care services for hard to reach,102
NA,groups across Australia and it will target-,102
The SPEAKER, The Minister will,102
NA,resume his seat. The member for Dickson-,102
Mr BUTLER, Ask a proper question.,102
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,102
The SPEAKER, Order! The member for,102
NA,Dickson on a point of order.,102
Mr Dutton," Mr Speaker, my point of",102
NA,order is on relevance. I do not know how the,102
NA,minister can be relevant when he is talking,102
NA,about the $580 million they have ripped out,102
NA,of health.,102
The SPEAKER, Order! The member for,102
NA,Dickson will excuse himself from the House,102
NA,under the provisions of standing order 94(a).,102
NA,The member for Dickson then left the,102
NA,chamber.,102
Mr BUTLER, It is apparent that the,102
NA,member for Dickson could not get a question,102
NA,up in tactics today so he had to try a point of,102
NA,order.,102
The SPEAKER, The minister will go to,102
NA,the question.,102
Mr BUTLER, This package recognises,102
NA,the diverse impact of mental illness across a,102
NA,person's lifetime. It will build resilient kids.,102
NA,It will support teenagers dealing with the,102
NA,emergence of mental illness. It will deliver,102
NA,more targeted primary-care services across,102
NA,"the community and it will deliver targeted,",102
NA,intensive and integrated supports for adults,102
NA,"and, of dealing with severe and chronic mental",102
NA,illness. We take the COAG process very,102
NA,"seriously, which is why we will be taking",102
NA,more than $200 million to the table later this,102
NA,year to help drive improvements in,102
NA,emergency departments and in supportive,102
NA,"accommodation, as well as continuing our",102
NA,plans for a long-term reform roadmap over,102
NA,the coming decade. We will establish the,102
NA,first ever national mental health commission,102
NA,reporting not to any particular department,102
NA,but to the Prime Minister and to this,102
NA,parliament.,102
NA,"Unlike the opposition's policies, these",102
NA,measures are properly costed and they are,102
NA,fully funded. They keep in place the broader,102
NA,health reform measures that the opposition,103
NA,"would have trashed, like the e-health record,",103
NA,by better targeted primary-care infrastructure,103
NA,"for local communities, like more targeted",103
NA,hospital funding instead of continuing to,103
NA,"send the states a blank cheque and, of course,",103
NA,like the GP after-hours hotline. This reform,103
NA,"package is comprehensive, it is balanced, it",103
NA,is targeted across the lifespan and it will,103
NA,make a real difference to millions and,103
NA,millions of Australians living with mental,103
NA,illness and their families.,103
NA,Budget,103
Mr HOCKEY ,North Sydney) (14:45):,103
NA,My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the,103
NA,Treasurer to Mr Ross Greenwood's advice to,103
NA,hundreds of thousands of Australians last,103
NA,night about the budget when he said: 'This,103
NA,does not take pressure off interest rates and,103
NA,"interest rates are forecast to rise, and that",103
NA,where the government had it within its own,103
NA,control.' Will the Treasurer advise,103
NA,Australians what the average mortgage,103
NA,holder will pay extra in mortgage,103
NA,repayments because of an anticipated one per,103
NA,cent increase in mortgage interest rates?,103
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,103
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:46): I am more,103
NA,than happy to answer the same question that,103
NA,"was asked before, again. The fact is this: the",103
NA,government has in place the fastest fiscal,103
NA,"consolidation on record, which is 3.8 per",103
NA,cent of GDP over two years. We have put in,103
NA,place very substantial savings. I have also,103
NA,"referred to the fact that, last Friday, the",103
NA,Reserve Bank in its statement of monetary,103
NA,policy pointed to just how tight fiscal policy,103
NA,"in Australia is. So any suggestion that,",103
NA,"somehow, our fiscal policy-",103
The SPEAKER, Order! The Treasurer,103
NA,will resume his seat. The Manager of,103
NA,Opposition Business on a point of order.,103
NA,NA,103
NA,asked how much the average mortgage will,103
NA,rise in terms of interest repayments. He was,103
NA,asked how much extra they would rise,103
NA,because of a one per cent increase in interest,103
NA,rates. He said he was asked the same,103
NA,question as before. He wasn't; it was a,103
NA,different question and I ask you to draw him,103
NA,back to it.,103
The SPEAKER, The Manager of,103
NA,Opposition Business will resume his seat.,103
NA,The Treasurer has the call and will respond,103
NA,to the question.,103
Mr SWAN," Mr Speaker, I was making",103
NA,the point that fiscal policy is tight and fiscal,103
NA,policy is getting tighter. That is the point that,103
NA,I was making. Of course it has been the point,103
NA,that has been made today and last night by,103
NA,any number of market economists. I will,103
NA,"quote Tim Toohey, Chief Economist of",103
NA,Goldman Sachs: 'It proposes a budget that,103
NA,is represents the biggest fiscal contraction since,103
NA,"1970, when comparable data commenced.",103
NA,The budget makes a genuine attempt to keep,103
NA,its commitment to return the budget to,103
NA,surplus.',103
NA,The opposition are out there quoting all,103
NA,sorts of people. Moody's said: 'Australian,103
NA,government debt remains the lowest of all,103
NA,AAA rated governments in the world.' The,103
NA,fact is we do have a fiscal position which is,103
NA,the envy of the world. We have low net debt,103
NA,compared to any of our peers and we have,103
NA,the strictest fiscal policy in place as we go,103
NA,"forward, not just over the forward estimates",103
NA,but in the years ahead.,103
NA,What this government will not do is what,103
NA,"the coalition government did when, at the",103
NA,"height of a mining boom, they went on a",103
NA,spending spree. They neglected to invest in,103
NA,infrastructure and skills and they had 10,103
NA,interest rate rises in a row. I am sure,103
NA,everybody in Australia understands that. We,103
NA,understand how important it is that,103
NA,government actions do not compound price,103
NA,pressures which flow from the investment,103
NA,pipeline that we are seeing. That is why we,104
NA,have in place a fast fiscal consolidation. The,104
NA,only threat to those fiscal settings are those,104
NA,"opposite, and if they want to vandalise the",104
NA,"surplus, they will live with the consequences.",104
NA,Budget,104
Ms OWENS ,Parramatta) (14:49): My,104
NA,"question is to the Minister for Families,",104
NA,"Housing, Community Services",104
NA,Indigenous Affairs. How is the government,104
NA,supporting Australian families through the,104
NA,budget and are there any threats to this,104
NA,support?,104
Ms MACKLIN ,Jagajaga-Minister for,104
NA,"Families, Housing, Community Services and",104
NA,Indigenous Affairs) (14:49): I thank the,104
NA,member for Parramatta for her question,104
NA,because she knows that last night's budget,104
NA,delivers for Australian families. We are,104
NA,delivering extra financial assistance for low-,104
NA,"and middle-income families, especially those",104
NA,"families with teenagers. Of course, it is this",104
NA,government that is also delivering for those,104
NA,families who need intensive support,104
NA,alongside tougher obligations for those,104
NA,families who are living in areas of,104
NA,entrenched disadvantage. We want to make,104
NA,sure that they get the extra help they need to,104
NA,make sure that they can get the skills to make,104
NA,"them ready for work so they, too, can share",104
NA,in the benefits of our economic,104
NA,opportunities.,104
NA,The highlight for families in last night's,104
NA,budget is the increase in family tax benefit,104
NA,part A for those families who have teenagers,104
NA,aged between 16 and 19. This is an increase,104
NA,in the amount of money that families with,104
NA,teenagers will receive and it will be a cost,104
NA,the budget of around $770 million. That is,104
NA,$770 million to boost support for families.,104
NA,"Of course, if you are a family on the",104
NA,"maximum rate of family tax benefit part A,",104
NA,that will mean that you will get an increase,104
NA,"of up to $4,200 if you have a child aged",104
NA,between 16 and 19 and that child is still,104
NA,"attending secondary school. What this will,",104
NA,"in fact, do is increase support for 650,000",104
NA,families over the next five years.,104
NA,The government is introducing this,104
NA,"change because, currently, assistance drops",104
NA,by $150 a fortnight when your child turns 15.,104
NA,and Whose policy would that have been? Of,104
NA,"course, it was the Liberal Party's policy that",104
NA,they had for 12 years that saw family tax,104
NA,benefit part A drop when your child turned,104
NA,"15. Our reforms, which we introduced in last",104
NA,"night's budget, will fix exactly that. The vast",104
NA,majority of Australians who have heard,104
NA,about this reform support it. I do say 'the vast,104
NA,"majority,' and you would be surprised to",104
NA,"wonder that there are some-not many, but",104
NA,some-who do not. They seem to me to be,104
NA,so out of touch with the needs of families,104
NA,that they are not supporting this idea. You,104
NA,might wonder who I am referring to. It is,104
NA,none other than the member for Sydney.,104
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,104
Ms MACKLIN, The member for North,104
NA,"Sydney-sorry, Tanya! The member for",104
NA,Sydney is a big supporter. The member for,104
NA,"North Sydney, when asked on ABC TV's",104
NA,Insiders if he would support the,104
NA,government's extra assistance for families,104
NA,"with teenagers, said:",104
NA,… I'm curious as to why the government is,104
NA,proceeding with this …,104
NA,That is what the member for North,104
NA,Sydney said on Sunday: 'curious'. The,104
NA,opposition is curious as to why you would,104
NA,want to give extra support to families with,104
NA,to teenagers. This shadow Treasurer is out there,104
NA,with Alice in Wonderland. I will tell you,104
NA,why we want to give extra support to,104
NA,families with teenagers: it is because they,104
NA,cost more as they get older. We want to keep,104
NA,them in school and it is only the Liberal,105
NA,Party that opposes it. (Time expired),105
NA,Budget,105
NA,Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (14:54): My,105
NA,question is to the Treasurer. Will the,105
NA,Treasurer inform the Australian people of the,105
NA,dollar figure in his budget for net,105
NA,"government debt in 2011-12, as well as the",105
NA,total dollar amount for interest payments,105
NA,needed to service that debt?,105
Mr SWAN ,Lilley-Deputy Prime,105
NA,Minister and Treasurer) (14:54): There is no,105
NA,secret about net debt. Net interest payments,105
NA,are $5.5 billion in 2011-12. There is no,105
NA,secret about that at all. And net debt is 7.2,105
NA,"per cent-that is, $106 billion.",105
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,105
The SPEAKER, Order!,105
Mr SWAN, It is truly amazing that those,105
NA,opposite would carry on like this when we,105
NA,have a net debt level which is the envy of,105
NA,developed world. The reason we have that,105
NA,net debt level is that we moved to support,105
NA,"our economy during the global recession,",105
NA,which saved the jobs of hundreds of,105
NA,thousands of Australians and kept open the,105
NA,doors of tens of thousands of small,105
NA,businesses. This was a very important,105
NA,support-,105
NA,"Mrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, I",105
NA,rise on a point of order on relevance. In the,105
NA,"new period of the new paradigm answers,",105
NA,when he must be directly relevant-in,105
NA,addition to the requirement within the,105
NA,Practice that question time be a time for,105
NA,eliciting information-would the Treasurer,105
NA,please answer the question as it was asked.,105
The SPEAKER, The member for,105
NA,Mackellar will resume her seat. I think we,105
NA,are now in the older period of the new,105
NA,paradigm. I think that if people were quiet,105
NA,and listened they might get information that,105
NA,"they are actually seeking, but they do not",105
NA,hear it because they are not listening. The,105
NA,Treasurer has the call; he will respond to the,105
NA,question.,105
Mr SWAN, I would like to quote the,105
NA,credit rating agency Moody's. Moody's said,105
NA,about debt:,105
NA,Moody's notes that Australian government,105
NA,debt remains among the lowest of all AAA-rated,105
NA,governments.,105
NA,Of course that is the case. We have one of,105
NA,"the best positions in the advanced world, and",105
NA,one of the reasons it is that low is that we,105
NA,moved to support our economy at a time of,105
NA,threat. Those opposite want to continue to,105
NA,pretend that the global financial crisis did not,105
NA,"happen, that a global recession did not",105
NA,happen and that it did not wash through or,105
NA,"touch our economy. It did, and it had a",105
NA,dramatic impact on revenues and it would,105
NA,have had a dramatic impact on employment,105
NA,if they had had their way. We moved to,105
NA,the support our economy. We took on a modest,105
NA,level of debt to keep Australians in work and,105
NA,"to keep the doors of business open, and",105
NA,Australia is all the better for it. We will come,105
NA,back to surplus in 2012-13. We will build,105
NA,"surpluses, we will pay down debt and we",105
NA,"will do that with a really healthy, strongly",105
NA,"growing economy, which would not be the",105
NA,case if those vandals over there had been in,105
NA,charge.,105
NA,Budget,105
Mr CHEESEMAN ,Corangamite),105
NA,(14:58): My question is to the Minister for,105
NA,Health and Ageing. How is the government's,105
NA,investment improving and reforming health,105
NA,services and how has this investment been,105
NA,received?,105
Ms ROXON ,Gellibrand-Minister for,105
NA,Health and Ageing) (14:58): I thank the,105
NA,member for Corangamite for his question. I,105
NA,know that when I visited his electorate with,105
NA,the member for Corio the local community,105
NA,received-in some cases with tears in their,105
NA,"eyes, as was the case with the nurses at",106
NA,Geelong Hospital-the news that the cancer,106
NA,centre that had for so long been their dream,106
NA,in Geelong was coming to reality. That is,106
NA,because in this year's budget we have,106
NA,allocated $1.8 billion-$1.3 billion of that,106
NA,being spent on 63 projects across the country,106
NA,in regional Australia. This has been received,106
NA,so well in the community that I have to,106
NA,report to the House that something incredibly,106
NA,strange happened. That incredibly strange,106
NA,thing was that the member for Indi actually,106
NA,said thank you. The member for Indi said,106
NA,thank you to the government for the $65,106
NA,million being invested in the Albury regional,106
NA,"cancer centre, which forms part of 24 cancer",106
NA,centres across the country. This has been,106
NA,made possible because this is the,106
NA,government's fourth health reform budget in,106
NA,a row. It is a health reform budget that,106
NA,proves that we did not have to choose,106
NA,between regional Australia and mental,106
NA,health. We did not have to choose between,106
NA,health reform and mental health. We have,106
NA,been able to fund all of those priorities,106
NA,because of the good work done by this,106
NA,"government, by the Treasurer and by others",106
NA,and because of the priority that we give to,106
NA,investing in important health services that,106
NA,are needed across the country. Unlike those,106
NA,"opposite, we have been able to fund each and",106
NA,every one of those commitments.,106
NA,"I know in communities such as Wagga,",106
NA,"Palmerston, Hervey Bay and Bega-all",106
NA,across the country-people are very grateful,106
NA,that these investments have been made. Of,106
NA,"course, my friends, who are sitting",106
NA,"together-the member for Lyne, the member",106
NA,"for Denison, the member for O'Connor and",106
NA,the member for New England-have also,106
NA,had their communities very enthusiastically,106
NA,receive news of our investment in hospitals,106
NA,not only in their electorates but in many,106
NA,other electorates as well. We are not just,106
NA,investing in infrastructure. The sorts of,106
NA,initiatives that the minister for mental health,106
NA,has already taken the House through show,106
NA,that we are serious and show the community,106
NA,that we will listen to their concerns. I want to,106
NA,take this opportunity to thank not just the,106
NA,minister for mental health but all of the,106
NA,advocates that he worked very closely with,106
NA,to make sure that this package was truly,106
NA,going to meet the needs of the community. It,106
NA,would truly meet the needs of those young,106
NA,"people who needed support, it would not",106
NA,"neglect the needs of children, it would look",106
NA,at the needs of adults with severe and,106
NA,persistent mental health problems and it,106
NA,would put pressure on our state colleagues to,106
NA,work with us to invest more to make sure,106
NA,that our hospital services whether they are in,106
NA,"the acute system, the hospital services, or",106
NA,"whether they are in the community, working",106
NA,"with GPs and psychologists and others,",106
NA,provide better services for those who have,106
NA,been falling through the gaps for far too,106
NA,long.,106
NA,But the real question now for the Leader,106
NA,"of the Opposition, having seen the fourth",106
NA,"health reform budget in a row, is for him to",106
NA,"be able to articulate on Thursday what, as a",106
NA,"former health minister, he would prefer to do",106
NA,in these areas and to tell us for once how he,106
NA,would actually fund those initiatives. We,106
NA,know last time when he tried to fund some of,106
NA,these packages that he wanted to stop,106
NA,"funding e-health, even though as health",106
NA,minister he promised to. He wanted to close,106
NA,super clinics. He has never once said,106
NA,whether he supports these regional hospital,106
NA,"projects across the country, and it is about",106
NA,time he told us if he did.,106
NA,Budget,106
Mr RUDDOCK ,Berowra) (15:02): My,106
NA,question is addressed to the Prime Minister.,106
NA,"Prime Minister, why is the government",106
NA,"cutting the budget of ASIO, Customs and",107
NA,deferring or cancelling $2.4 billion worth of,107
NA,defence projects when it cannot protect and,107
NA,secure our borders?,107
Ms GILLARD ,Lalor-Prime Minister),107
NA,(15:02): I thank the member for his,107
NA,question. What I can say to the member is,107
NA,that if he studies the details of the budget,107
NA,papers and particularly the announcement,107
NA,"made by the Minister for Defence last week,",107
NA,he will find that there has been some,107
NA,movement of capital for issues associated,107
NA,with the procurement of that capital and then,107
NA,of course there have been arrangements,107
NA,"made on the civilian side, the public service",107
NA,"side, of Defence for new efficiencies, which",107
NA,will occasion a reduction in jobs-that is,107
NA,true-but they are on the public service side.,107
NA,So the member asking the question should,107
NA,not be seeking to mislead Australians and to,107
NA,pretend that the positions that the Minister,107
NA,for Defence has been referring to are,107
NA,positions that are in some way associated,107
NA,with patrolling our borders. The truth is and,107
NA,the truth remains that this government has,107
NA,more assets patrolling our borders than ever,107
NA,before. The member who asked the question,107
NA,has some expertise in relation to judging,107
NA,"these issues, and he should use that",107
NA,expertise-,107
NA,NA,107
The SPEAKER, Order! The member for,107
NA,Sturt is warned!,107
Ms GILLARD, The member who asked,107
NA,the question has some familiarity too with,107
NA,the complexity of dealing with asylum,107
NA,"seeker questions. What the member, I think,",107
NA,should recognise on a fair reckoning is that,107
NA,the statement put out by me and the Prime,107
NA,"Minister of Malaysia, a joint statement,",107
NA,innovative approach under a regional,107
NA,framework to a truly regional problem.,107
NA,"When you are dealing with this problem, if",107
NA,you are not working regionally then anything,107
NA,you seek to do will ultimately come to,107
NA,nought. So we will continue to pursue our,107
NA,work as announced by the minister for,107
NA,"immigration and me on Saturday, and I",107
NA,would counsel the member and the Leader of,107
NA,"the Opposition that, amongst all the",107
NA,distortions they are currently engaged in with,107
NA,"the Australian community, they do not add",107
NA,misrepresenting the defence position of this,107
NA,nation to the list.,107
NA,Budget,107
Ms SAFFIN ,Page) (15:05): My question,107
NA,is to the Minister for Infrastructure and,107
NA,"Transport. Minister, how will the budget",107
NA,help drive reform and investment in the area,107
NA,of transport infrastructure and particularly,107
NA,for the Pacific Highway?,107
Mr ALBANESE ,Grayndler-Leader of,107
NA,the House and Minister for Infrastructure and,107
NA,Transport) (15:05): I thank the member for,107
NA,Page for her question and her ongoing,107
NA,commitment to infrastructure on the Pacific,107
NA,Highway. Like the member for Richmond,107
NA,"and the member for Lyne, she has",107
NA,campaigned long and hard to make sure that,107
NA,we deal with this most vital of roads that has,107
NA,been identified by Infrastructure Australia as,107
NA,an absolute priority.,107
NA,Last night's budget provided additional,107
NA,funding of $1.02 billion for the Pacific,107
NA,"Highway, bringing the federal government",107
NA,contribution to $4.1 billion over seven years.,107
NA,That compares with our predecessors who,107
NA,contributed $1.3 billion over 12 years of,107
NA,"neglect. Indeed, if the former government",107
NA,had contributed at the same rate as this Labor,107
NA,"government, the Pacific Highway would now",107
NA,"be fully duplicated, finished, done and",107
NA,"dusted. You would expect, as the member for",107
NA,is an Lyne and the member for Richmond and the,107
NA,member for Page and others have welcomed,107
NA,"this announcement, that across the board this",107
NA,"would get support. But, of course, we have",107
NA,an opposition that cannot read the budget,107
NA,papers and simply does not understand,108
NA,infrastructure. The member for Cowper has,108
NA,actually been out there saying that this is just,108
NA,"a reallocation of funds, that there is nothing",108
NA,new there. The budget papers make it clear,108
NA,that of the $1.02 billion $270 million is a,108
NA,reallocation agreed between the government,108
NA,and the O'Farrell government and $750,108
NA,million of that is absolutely new money. It is,108
NA,"adding up to an additional 1.02 billion, and",108
NA,"the clown over there, the shadow minister,",108
NA,"just says, 'Oh, it's not. Forget about what the",108
NA,budget papers say.',108
The SPEAKER, Order! The minister,108
NA,will withdraw.,108
Mr ALBANESE, I withdraw. It is now,108
NA,since 2009 that I had a question on,108
NA,infrastructure from the shadow minister,108
NA,opposite. So you have the local member for,108
NA,Cowper and when he goes and has a look at,108
NA,the work taking place-today more than a,108
NA,thousand workers are in place working on,108
NA,the Pacific Highway-and what is happening,108
NA,"on the Kempsey bypass, well, maybe it's a",108
NA,"mirage! Well, I tell you what: the incoming",108
NA,New South Wales government have built a,108
NA,viewing platform at the Kempsey bypass so,108
NA,"they can look at our dollars at work, so they",108
NA,can look at our jobs taking place. The,108
NA,shadow Treasurer has gone further. The,108
NA,shadow Treasurer has said that this is just for,108
NA,planning and he cannot understand why it is,108
NA,just for planning. It is not. What it will do is regional,108
NA,enable construction to be brought forward,108
NA,including on the Frederickton to Eungai,108
NA,"section, which is where the Clybucca bus",108
NA,crash happened all those decades ago. Two,108
NA,"decades ago it happened, but it has taken this",108
NA,government to provide the funds. We,108
NA,provided $58 million for planning in 2009.,108
NA,Now we have provided an extra billion,108
NA,dollars to make sure that construction can be,108
NA,brought forward. This is a government that,108
NA,believes in nation building. This is a,108
NA,government that is delivering.,108
NA,Budget,108
Mr MORRISON ,Cook) (15:09): My,108
NA,question is to the Minister for Immigration,108
NA,and Citizenship. I refer to the requirement to,108
NA,repair and rebuild the Villawood and,108
NA,Christmas Island detention facilities,108
NA,following their incineration and destruction,108
NA,during the recent riots at those centres. What,108
NA,will be the cost to taxpayers of this rebuild,108
NA,and can the minister refer the House to the,108
NA,page in the budget papers where that figure,108
NA,is stated?,108
Mr BOWEN ,MCMahon-Minister for,108
NA,Immigration and Citizenship) (15:10): I,108
NA,thank the honourable member for his,108
NA,question. I cannot refer him to the page in,108
NA,the budget papers because it is not in the,108
NA,budget because it is covered by insurance,108
NA,policies.,108
Mr Morrison," Mr Speaker, I rise on a",108
NA,point of order. My question was: what was,108
NA,the cost?,108
The SPEAKER, Order! The member,108
NA,will resume his place.,108
NA,Budget,108
Mr GIBBONS ,Bendigo) (15:11): My,108
NA,question is to the Minister for Regional,108
NA,"Australia, Regional Development and Local",108
NA,Government. How will the budget help,108
NA,communities embrace the,108
NA,challenges of an economy in transition?,108
Mr CREAN ,Hotham-Minister for,108
NA,"Regional Australia, Regional Development",108
NA,and Local Government and Minister for the,108
NA,Arts) (15:11): I thank the honourable,108
NA,"member for Bendigo for his question,",108
NA,because he has been a passionate advocate,108
NA,"for his region, his patch of the great",108
NA,Australian economy that is in the Bendigo,108
NA,region. The budget rightly identifies,108
NA,"Australia as an economy in transition, and of",109
NA,course if we are to meet the challenge of,109
NA,what that economy in transition means it,109
NA,does require us to look at the initiatives and,109
NA,the funding proposals that help us diversify,109
NA,the economic base. Also it is not just a,109
NA,question of getting the programs in place; it,109
NA,is essential that we get the delivery mode,109
NA,right. And the truth is that the budget also,109
NA,recognises that delivery must recognise the,109
NA,patchwork nature of the economy because it,109
NA,is giving greater emphasis to delivery,109
NA,through the lens of localism through the,109
NA,regions.,109
NA,"As for the programs that are important, in",109
NA,addressing one of the key ingredients as to,109
NA,"how we transition an economy, how we",109
NA,"drive the economic diversity, it is skills",109
NA,"development, because without the skills,",109
NA,"without building the skills base, we run into",109
NA,"a self-imposed constraint. Accordingly, the",109
NA,budget makes significant commitments to,109
NA,targeted incentives to develop the skills. It,109
NA,does it through the National Workforce,109
NA,Development Fund and it is complemented,109
NA,by significant initiatives that improve,109
NA,"participation. It also identifies 16,000 places",109
NA,under the Regional Skilled Migration,109
NA,scheme. But if they are to work properly for,109
NA,"the various patches, so if we are to get the",109
NA,"patches working properly, we have to have",109
NA,the input at the local level that identifies,109
NA,"what their needs are, where they identify",109
NA,what their skill shortages are and what their,109
NA,training needs are. They access these,109
NA,programs by a matching of skills required,109
NA,with skills supplied.,109
NA,That is why another pleasing dimension of,109
NA,this budget is the extension of the,109
NA,opportunity to local employment,109
NA,"coordinators, in conjunction with the",109
NA,regional development network that we have,109
NA,"established, to undertake skills audits",109
NA,regions themselves can best identify and,109
NA,match. The last time that this was effectively,109
NA,done it was done by a Labor government. It,109
NA,was done by a Labor government with me as,109
NA,the minister for education. That was when,109
NA,we introduced the area consultative,109
NA,committees whose task was to match supply,109
NA,with demand. This was a terribly effective,109
NA,program. When the others inherited office,109
NA,they kept the area consultative committees in,109
NA,name but never utilised them to their full,109
NA,capacity. They sent them off on a regional,109
NA,rorts program. The member for Indi would,109
NA,well remember one of those regional rorts,109
NA,because it was the cheese factory in her,109
NA,"electorate that was on the nose, went bust-",109
NA,wasted money. But the truth is that we are,109
NA,going to go back to this successful model.,109
NA,This budget lays the foundation for it. We,109
NA,did it then and we will do it again. It will,109
NA,only happen under the stewardship of a,109
NA,Labor government.,109
Ms GILLARD," Mr Speaker, I ask that",109
NA,further questions be placed on the Notice,109
NA,Paper.,109
NA,NA,109
NA,that we reached with the government and the,109
NA,"crossbenchers at the end of last year, on 6",109
NA,"September 2010, said at paragraphs 4.3 that",109
NA,question time will conclude no later than,109
NA,3:30 pm-it is quarter past three-enabling,109
NA,20 questions each day in the normal course,109
NA,of events. The point is that there have only,109
NA,been 19 questions today. It is not yet 3.30,109
NA,and therefore the opposition has the next turn,109
NA,"for questions, and 20 questions would then",109
NA,"allow us, because question time has not",109
NA,"finished at 3.30, to ask our next question.",109
The SPEAKER, Order! The House will,109
NA,settle down. There is no point of order.,109
NA,Proceedings have occurred as is allowed by,109
NA,the standing orders. The member for,109
NA,Menzies has been very well behaved. As a,109
NA,"reward for his good behaviour, I wish to",109
NA,so that inform the House that it is the 20th,109
NA,anniversary of his election at a by-election,109
NA,on 11 May 1991 and I think that individual,110
NA,members' significant anniversaries of that,110
NA,"nature should be acknowledged in the House,",110
NA,and I do so sincerely.,110
NA,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,110
NA,WYATT ROY (Longman) (15:17): Mr,110
NA,"Speaker, I wish to make a personal",110
NA,explanation.,110
The SPEAKER, Does the member claim,110
NA,to have been misrepresented?,110
NA,"WYATT ROY: I do, Mr Speaker, most",110
NA,grievously.,110
The SPEAKER, The honourable,110
NA,member may proceed.,110
NA,WYATT ROY: I have never spent a day,110
NA,"on the dole, contrary to the remarks of the",110

NA,That this House: (1) notes that as the world,111
NA,emerges from the Global Financial Crisis: (a) in,111
NA,Australia unemployment of 5 per cent is low by,111
NA,international standards; and (b) the Australian,111
NA,Government's Debt to GDP ratio is lower and its,111
NA,"fiscal consolidation faster, than in most",111
NA,comparable countries; and (2) agrees that the,111
NA,Gillard Government's fiscal strategy to assist,111
NA,business and communities to recover from this,111
NA,crisis while managing inflation and removing the,111
NA,structural deficits from the Federal Budget is the,111
NA,right course of action for Australia's long term,111

NA,cultural diversity; (b) commends the State of,112
NA,"Israel's commitment to democracy, the rule of law",112

NA,commitment to Israel's right to exist in peace and,112

NA,issue; and (2) notes with concern the fraying of,112

Mr HOCKEY ,North Sydney) (15:22):,117
NA,At 7.30 last night the Treasurer rose to his,117
NA,feet to deliver his budget speech. His,117
NA,"opening words were, 'This is a Labor",117
NA,"budget.' Well, most Australians turned off at",117
NA,"7.31, as soon as he said that. Why? Because",117
NA,being a true Labor budget it delivered bigger,117
NA,"debt, bigger deficits and bigger spin. The",117
NA,"Orders deficits in this budget, the stuff that really",117
NA,"matters to Australians today, are growing.",117
NA,The budget deficit this year has grown in the,117
NA,last six months from $42 billion to nearly,117
NA,$50 billion. That means the government is,117
NA,borrowing $135 million every day just to,117
NA,fund the deficit. The budget deficit for next,117
NA,"year, which is the appropriation bill that this",117
NA,"House is going to vote on, is actually",117
NA,growing from $12 billion to $22.6 billion.,117
NA,The Treasurer expects us to believe the,117
NA,fairytale story and for the Australian people,117
NA,to accept-with this year's budget deficit,117
NA,situation deteriorating because of external,117
NA,circumstances and the government's increase,117
NA,"in its own expenditure, and next year's",117
NA,"budget deficit increasing, including increased",117
NA,government expenditure-the only budget,117
NA,"narrative the government had today, and that",117
NA,is that in two years time they will bring the,117
NA,budget back into surplus. That is the only,117
NA,Budget narrative they had in this place today-to,117
NA,promise something that they promised last,117
NA,"year, to promise something that they",117
NA,promised the year before. But the difference,117
NA,is that with the Labor Party it is 50 per cent,117
NA,"promise, 50 per cent excuse. The debt of",117
NA,"Australia, the net debt of the government, is",117
NA,"now $106.6 billion-in dollar terms, the",117
NA,highest of all time. It is a deterioration in the,117
NA,net debt figure from $94 billion. Buried deep,117
NA,in the budget papers we have now discovered,117
NA,that the government is going to ask the,117
NA,parliament to increase the amount of debt,117
NA,issuance to $250 billion in gross terms. Of,117
NA,"course, they are going to use the excuse of",117
NA,Basel III to maintain what will be since,117
NA,World War II the largest debt issuance in our,117
NA,modern history.,117
NA,What does this all mean? For everyday,117
NA,Australians it means that the interest on the,117
NA,Labor Party debt will increase to $18 million,117
NA,a day every day for the next four years. It,117
NA,"means that by the fourth year of this budget,",118
NA,interest will rise to $7½ billion. And the,118
NA,government expect us to believe the fairytale,118
NA,story that somehow they are going to bring,118
NA,the budget back to surplus with fiscal,118
NA,discipline. They sold and spun in the budget,118
NA,speech last night $22 billion of so-called,118
NA,savings. Ignore the fact that a third of that,118
NA,"was tax increases. Even so, $22 billion, and",118
NA,now people are becoming more aware that,118
NA,the government is spending $19 billion of,118
NA,"that $22 billion. But most intriguingly, and",118
NA,"this is where the rubber hits the road, next",118
NA,year-in the year when we have stronger,118
NA,"economic growth, where we have",118
NA,"unemployment dropping to 4.5 per cent,",118
NA,where the government is running a bigger,118
NA,budget deficit-in that year the government,118
NA,is going to spend $2.2 billion more than it is,118
NA,saving. These much lauded savings that are,118
NA,going to bring the budget whirring back to,118
NA,"surplus, in the budget where the rubber hits",118
NA,"the road they are spending $2.2 billion more,",118
NA,and it is not even an election year. Growth is,118
NA,going up to four per cent but employment,118
NA,growth is actually slowing.,118
NA,If we cut through the spin of this,118
NA,"incompetent Treasurer, what we can",118
NA,recognise is that he is desperate to get,118
NA,adulation. He talks about the emotion of,118
NA,"putting together a budget, how he is sleepless",118
NA,at night about the difficulty and challenges,118
NA,"associated with the Australian economy, an",118
NA,Australian economy that he lauds as the best,118
NA,"in the world. Yet he is so sleepless, he is so",118
NA,"lost, he is suffering such insomnia.",118
NA,Employment growth is slowing even,118
NA,though this government is desperate to spin,118
NA,half a million jobs being created over the,118
NA,next two years. That is an employment,118
NA,growth rate of just 2.2 per cent. It is less,118
NA,the last three years of the Howard,118
NA,"government at three per cent and, what is",118
NA,"more, it is less than the last 12 months of this",118
NA,"government itself, which had employment",118
NA,"growth of three per cent, with 320,000 jobs",118
NA,created in the last calendar year. And,118
NA,somehow they think that it is a momentous,118
NA,achievement for them to be in the business of,118
NA,overseeing an economy creating half a,118
NA,million jobs in two years when the same,118
NA,"economy created 320,000 jobs in the last 12",118
NA,months.,118
NA,"On inflation, what I think was quite",118
NA,"alarming was that last night, when you dig",118
NA,"deep into the budget, the core inflation",118
NA,figures indicate that inflation is going up to,118
NA,"three per cent, the top of the Reserve Bank",118
NA,"band, by June 2013. Currently it is 2.25 per",118
NA,cent. We are in an environment where the,118
NA,Reserve Bank has clearly indicated it is,118
NA,going to take action. I want to make it,118
NA,perfectly clear to the Australian people and,118
NA,this parliament that Wayne Swan and Julia,118
NA,Gillard are going to own every interest rate,118
NA,increase from here on. They are going to be,118
NA,responsible for making life harder for,118
NA,everyday Australians and not easier. They,118
NA,had the chance in this budget. They had the,118
NA,"opportunity to make the hard yards, and they",118
NA,failed that test because they lack courage.,118
NA,They talk courage but they display no,118
NA,courage. They talk surplus but they deliver,118
NA,deficit. They talk net debt as a negative and,118
NA,now they are going to deliver a significant,118
NA,increase in net debt.,118
NA,This is a government that has never met,118
NA,"its budget targets. I say to you why, Mr",118
NA,Deputy Speaker. It is because this,118
NA,government does not have internal,118
NA,discipline. They lack the processes for,118
NA,"actually making hard decisions, as illustrated",118
NA,by the fact that they leaked $400 million in,118
NA,than cuts in medical research and did not proceed,118
NA,with it. They leaked that they were going to,118
NA,cut childcare benefits and then did not,118
NA,proceed with it. What did they do? They cut,119
NA,families by $2 billion. It is something I said,119
NA,to the Leader of the Opposition in the lock-,119
NA,up: I cannot believe this government is,119
NA,reducing the real increases in the family tax,119
NA,"benefit for families on $45,000 a year. Why",119
NA,would they do it?,119
Mr Bradbury, It is a supplement.,119
Mr HOCKEY, He says it is a,119
NA,"supplement. It is not real money: is that it,",119
NA,sunshine? It is not real money. Two billion,119
NA,dollars is not real money. Somehow it is in,119
NA,"your budget, so either it is real money and it",119
NA,"is really going to affect Australians or, as the",119
NA,"member for Lindsay would say, it is not real",119
NA,"money. I say to you, sir, that Australian",119
NA,"families are struggling, and particularly in",119
NA,your electorate of Lindsay. Your budget is,119
NA,indifferent to the plight of your people. Your,119
NA,budget is ignorant of the fact that everyday,119
NA,Australians are struggling: they are finding it,119
NA,"harder to pay for higher electricity bills, for",119
NA,"higher mortgage repayments, for higher fruit",119
NA,"and vegetable prices, for higher petrol prices.",119
NA,This is a government that is overseeing a,119
NA,deterioration in the living standards of,119
NA,middle Australia. And why? Because of their,119
NA,own fiscal recklessness.,119
NA,There is one figure set that illustrates this,119
NA,more graphically than any other. It is the fact,119
NA,that since Labor was elected the Public,119
NA,"Service in Canberra has increased by 20,000",119
NA,employees. Last night in the so-called tough,119
NA,budget the government increased the size of,119
NA,"the Public Service by a further 1,100",119
NA,"employees, including 200 in the Department",119
NA,of Prime Minister and Cabinet alone and 55,119
NA,in the Department of the Treasury. So at that,119
NA,"time, when they are talking tough and",119
NA,"expecting Australians to cut their cloth, this",119
NA,"is a government that is going on a binge, a",119
NA,binge that is based on politics and not policy.,119
NA,"Of course, in the budget there are reflections",119
NA,"of their policy failures, which Australian",119
NA,families are now paying for. The $1.2 billion,119
NA,blow-out in the computers in schools,119
NA,program grew a further $200 million in last,119
NA,night's budget to $1.4 billion. The,119
NA,government's failed border protection policy,119
NA,"has grown out by an additional $1.75 billion,",119
NA,and I suspect we will hear more about the,119
NA,growing bill for their failed border protection,119
NA,policies. What about the $111 million that is,119
NA,going to have to be spent mopping up the,119
NA,"failed pink batts policy? How about that one,",119
NA,Mr Deputy Speaker? Of course this all,119
NA,reflects the fact that the Labor Party cannot,119
NA,rein in its spending. The Treasurer keeps,119
NA,talking about spending growth. He is,119
NA,working off a very high base because of,119
NA,course the government went for the credit,119
NA,"card during the financial crisis, handing out",119
NA,"$900 cheques, building school halls,",119
NA,"installing pink batts, putting solar panels on",119
NA,roofs-they did it all. They smoked the,119
NA,credit card at the moment when Australia,119
NA,could not afford to have an excessive fiscal,119
NA,stimulus. It turns out that Australia gets a,119
NA,"silver medal, or maybe even a bronze medal,",119
NA,for the biggest fiscal stimulus in the world as,119
NA,"a percentage of GDP, and now we are paying",119
NA,a heavy price for it.,119
NA,At no time in the forward estimates-and,119
NA,wasn't the Treasurer caught out by this,119
NA,today!-or at any time has the government's,119
NA,expenditure as a percentage of GDP been as,119
NA,low as it was in the last year of the Howard,119
NA,government. The Treasurer says that we,119
NA,were a profligate government-,119
Mr Shorten, You were.,119
Mr HOCKEY, yet nowhere in all of the,119
NA,budget figures at any time does the Labor,119
NA,Party ever get to the 22.9 per cent of GDP of,119
NA,"the coalition in its last year. Then, belatedly,",119
NA,"in a defensive mood, the Treasurer comes",119
NA,"into this place and says, 'Oh, well, look at the",119
NA,average of the coalition. We are less than,119
NA,that.' So I looked at the average of the Labor,119
NA,Party so that we can compare apples with,120
NA,apples. Under the coalition on average over,120
NA,"all of that period, including the very difficult",120
NA,period when we had negative growth during,120
NA,"the Asian financial crisis, the coalition's",120
NA,"percentage increased significantly, as it does",120
NA,when the economy comes down-the,120
NA,percentage of government expenditure rises,120
NA,as a percentage of GDP-but on average the,120
NA,Labor Party has been spending 24.6 per cent,120
NA,of GDP and the coalition just 24.03 per cent.,120
NA,When you add in the revenue and,120
NA,expenditure associated with the carbon tax at,120
NA,"$26 a tonne-boom, boom! It all goes.",120
NA,"Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker?",120
NA,This is the challenge for the government:,120
NA,assuming there are no major new policy,120
NA,"initiatives over the next two years, assuming",120
NA,the carbon tax is not going to have any,120
NA,"impact on the budget, assuming there are no",120
NA,"other challenges ahead, assuming that the",120
NA,terms of trade will remain at the highest level,120
NA,"in 150 years, assuming that old Penny Wong",120
NA,can control the Prime Minister as she,120
NA,"claimed to do. My goodness, what a mud",120
NA,wrestle! Senator Penny Wong claimed that,120
NA,she was going to control the Prime Minister's,120
NA,excessive demands for spending. I say to,120
NA,you: this mob will never deliver a budget,120
NA,surplus. This mob will never have the,120
NA,"courage to deliver a budget surplus and, as",120
NA,the member for Longman said so vividly,120
NA,"earlier, in question time, in his entire lifetime",120
NA,Labor have never delivered a budget surplus.,120
NA,Even though he was conceived in a surplus,120
NA,he was delivered in a deficit. It just goes to,120
NA,show what a celebration it was when Labor,120
NA,"last delivered a budget surplus, and when",120
NA,Labor delivers a surplus again we will all,120
NA,give a good cheer and have a great party.,120
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Assistant,120
NA,Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services,120
NA,and Superannuation) (15:34): I listened,120
NA,carefully to the shadow Treasurer's speech. I,120
NA,think he has missed a lot of what happened,120
NA,"in the budget last night, so I am pleased to",120
NA,assist and to be a torchlight of clarity in this,120
NA,matter of public importance debate. I am,120
NA,pleased to switch on the lights.,120
NA,Australia is experiencing an economy in,120
NA,transition. We need to get our policy settings,120
NA,right. We on this side of the House,120
NA,"understand that our economy is changing,",120
NA,and we need to make sure that government,120
NA,policies change to assist Australians to,120
NA,prosper from the transition of our economy.,120
NA,There are transformative forces at work in,120
NA,our world. On this side we understand the,120
NA,growth in the emergence of Asia. We,120
NA,understand that our population is growing,120
NA,older. We understand that information is,120
NA,king in the modern era and that the,120
NA,information pipeline is going to be a,120
NA,fundamental driver of economic,120
NA,"organisation. We understand that, along with",120
NA,the high commodities prices in the mineral,120
NA,"boom, we are also expanding as a services",120
NA,economy. We also understand that we need,120
NA,to change to a low-pollution economy.,120
NA,This budget is an attempt to get away,120
NA,"from sound bite style policy, which is,",120
NA,"tragically, so beloved of the opposition. It is",120
NA,a search for systemic ways to make our,120
NA,"nation more sustainable, more innovative",120
NA,and indeed more competitive. It is to help us,120
NA,"make the transition into a digital economy, a",120
NA,low-pollution economy and an economy,120
NA,which can spread the benefits of the mining,120
NA,boom throughout all parts of this nation.,120
NA,"After all, if the global phenomena of climate",120
NA,change and the global financial crisis have,120
NA,taught us anything at all it is this: everything,120
NA,and everyone is connected and change is not,120
NA,optional; it is inevitable. That is why this,120
NA,budget is so important. That is why,120
NA,Treasurer Swan's fourth budget is such a,120
NA,"very good one. It is a statement of purpose,",121
NA,and the purpose is to secure our future his,121
NA,budget endeavours to tackle the cost of living,121
NA,issues and it builds upon Treasurer Swan's,121
NA,previous three budgets. Let us go through,121
NA,some of the contributions of the government,121
NA,to tackling the cost of living. People are,121
NA,"paying lower taxes. Someone on $50,000 a",121
NA,"year is paying $1,750, or 18 per cent, less",121
NA,than in 2007-08. The tax to GDP ratio-a,121
NA,"statistic which was cleverly, selectively and",121
NA,disingenuously ignored by the opposition,121
NA,spokesperson who just gave us his,121
NA,contribution-has dropped from 23½ per,121
NA,cent in the last year of the Howard-Costello,121
NA,"regime, when we came to office, to 20.3 per",121
NA,cent in 2009-10.,121
NA,Since September 2009 we have tackled,121
NA,the cost of living pressure on pensioners by,121
NA,increasing the age pension. It is up $128 a,121
NA,fortnight for single pensioners and around,121
NA,$116 for pensioner couples. We have,121
NA,developed the education tax refund. This is,121
NA,where families can claim up to 50 per cent of,121
NA,"their education costs, up to $397 per year, for",121
NA,every child in primary school and up to $794,121
NA,for each child in secondary school. There are,121
NA,over one million families and 1.7 million,121
NA,children who have already benefited from,121
NA,this education tax refund. We have also,121
NA,extended the education tax refund to school,121
NA,uniforms. Parents now will be able to claim,121
NA,up to 50 per cent of the cost of uniforms,121
NA,incurred from 1 July 2011-yet again,121
NA,helping with the cost of living pressures.,121
NA,In this budget we were pleased to,121
NA,"announce the increase of $4,200 to families",121
NA,who are receiving family tax benefit A. We,121
NA,"have committed to increasing it up to $4,200",121
NA,a year per teenager to help families meet the,121
NA,costs of older children still at school and to,121
NA,encourage more teenagers to stay at school.,121
NA,From 1 January 2012 we will increase the,121
NA,maximum payment rate of family tax benefit,121
NA,A by around $160 per fortnight for teenagers,121
NA,who are aged between 16 and 19 years who,121
NA,are in school or studying for an equivalent,121
NA,vocational qualification. This is going to,121
NA,"benefit 650,000 teenagers turning 16 over the",121
NA,next five years.,121
NA,But of course the best way to deal with the,121
NA,cost of living is to ensure that people have a,121
NA,job. Having a decent job is the best way to,121
NA,tax deal with cost of living pressures. Since,121
NA,"2007, under the stewardship of our",121
NA,"Treasurer, we have overseen the creation of",121
NA,"700,000 new jobs, in mining, retail, health",121
NA,"and the skilled trades. That is 550 jobs a day,",121
NA,"every day, since Labor took office. And now",121
NA,"there are over 440,000 Australians in training",121
NA,or apprenticeships. They are getting real,121
NA,"training for careers in construction,",121
NA,"automotive, furnishing, tourism, plumbing",121
NA,and hairdressing. We will increase the,121
NA,number of apprenticeships over the next,121
NA,"three years by another 50,000. Liberal",121
NA,"policy, I am afraid to report to the House, is",121
NA,to cut $2 billion from training and to sack,121
NA,"80,000 trainees.",121
NA,When we look at this cost of living debate,121
NA,"and what this budget contributes, we need to",121
NA,further put the facts in black and white. If,121
NA,"you have got children in child care, you will",121
NA,get the choice of claiming childcare,121
NA,payments more regularly-getting the,121
NA,money in your pocket and off the bill you,121
NA,"have. As I said, if you have children at",121
NA,"school, you will be able to claim for their",121
NA,school uniforms. If your children are,121
NA,"teenagers, we are increasing the family tax",121
NA,benefit payment by about $160 per fortnight.,121
NA,"Also, importantly, if you are one of 50,000",121
NA,"single parents, tax rates will be cut by up to",121
NA,"20c in the dollar. If you want some training,",121
NA,"to obtain a higher wage, as I have said, we",121
NA,"are creating 130,000 training spots. If you",121
NA,"want to be an apprentice, or if you have a",121
NA,teenage son or daughter who wants to be,121
NA,"one, we will give more support for people to",121
NA,"complete their training, through mentoring",121
NA,guidance and allowing good apprentices to,122
NA,get their qualifications quickly. If you are a,122
NA,"tradesperson or a small business, if you are",122
NA,buying a new ute or car which is necessary,122
NA,"for the business, you will be able to claim",122
NA,"$5,000 back in tax. That is real help in terms",122
NA,of the cost of living.,122
NA,"If you are a low-income earner, you will",122
NA,get more in your pay packet each week,122
NA,through the advance payment of the low-,122
NA,income tax offset. If you are finding it tough,122
NA,"to get a job, there will be 35,000 wage",122
NA,subsidies for the very long-term unemployed,122
NA,"job seekers, to help them get a job, and",122
NA,"30,000 training places for single and teenage",122
NA,"parents, to help them get the skills they need.",122
NA,Importantly-and dear to my heart-if you,122
NA,have the challenges and the financial costs,122
NA,which arise from having a disabled child in,122
NA,"the school system, we will be contributing",122
NA,$200 million to the special schools and the,122
NA,school systems of various states in order to,122
NA,better support disabled children getting an,122
NA,education. If you are worried about your,122
NA,"local hospital, there is $3.4 billion for",122
NA,emergency departments and elective surgery.,122
NA,There is $613 million for new medicines and,122
NA,making immunisation more affordable. If,122
NA,"there is a teacher in your family, or you are a",122
NA,family that places a lot of value on the,122
NA,"quality of your child's teacher, there is $425",122
NA,million to reward our top performing,122
NA,teachers across the country.,122
NA,This is a real list of things which go to the,122
NA,"day-to-day lives, the lived experience, of",122
NA,people in the suburbs and regions of,122
NA,Australia. But I would not want the House,122
NA,just to take my word for the benefits of this,122
NA,"budget. I will quote David Koch, who is a",122
NA,very well-known commentator. He said in,122
NA,today's paper-and it is a fair assessment:,122
NA,The overriding theme is that if you don‘t,122
NA,"a job, or if you earn a comfortable income, there",122
NA,are no more easy Government handouts.,122
NA,Perhaps that is what is worrying the,122
NA,opposition. Kochie also said:,122
NA,Compared with the rest of the world we are an,122
NA,economic miracle. Economic growth will be,122
NA,reasonable (after the hiccup of the natural,122
NA,"disasters), inflation on target, unemployment",122
NA,falling and-,122
NA,despite the Chicken Little prognostications,122
NA,of those opposite-,122
NA,Government debt tiny compared with the rest,122
NA,of the world.,122
NA,Kochie could be viewed to be a commentator,122
NA,"for the government, but he is not. He is",122
NA,"independent, as I know the shadow Treasurer",122
NA,thinks. If Kochie were not sufficiently,122
NA,"convincing and compelling, CommSec Chief",122
NA,"Economist Craig James, who is hardly a",122
NA,"member of the Marxist international, said:",122
NA,"Overall, it is a smart Budget, right for the",122
NA,times and challenges ahead.,122
NA,"Meanwhile, the ratings agency Moody's, who",122
NA,"are hardly Green Left Weekly, have",122
NA,reconfirmed our AAA rating and said:,122
NA,… Moody's notes that Australia's government,122
NA,debt remains amongst the lowest of all AAA-,122
NA,rated governments.,122
NA,"The chief economist of UBS, Scott Haslem",122
NA,said:,122
NA,The bias towards reduced spending over new,122
NA,taxes to offset revenue shortfalls is commendable.,122
NA,UBS says that what the government has done,122
NA,is commendable. Heather Ridout of the,122
NA,Australian Industry Group has said:,122
NA,We believe this budget is very solid on the,122
NA,fundamentals. It makes a solid investment in,122
NA,skills … I think it will take pressure off interest,122
NA,rates in the longer term.,122
NA,But again it does not stop there with the,122
NA,"commentary. On Bloomberg, it says:",122
NA,Australia's government will end 23 years of,122
NA,have spending growth to ease inflation from the,122
NA,biggest mining investment boom in the nation's,122
NA,history.,122
NA,But of course the opposition would not rate,123
NA,"CommSec, they would not rate UBS, they",123
NA,"would not rate Kochie, they would not rate",123
NA,"Bloomberg, because they do not agree with",123
NA,their view of the world.,123
NA,"I think it is important, when we are having",123
NA,a debate about who is doing the best in terms,123
NA,"of the budget, that we understand that this",123
NA,budget is not formed in isolation. Politics is,123
NA,not a one-horse race; it is a two-horse race.,123
NA,We have to see what the opposition would,123
NA,do. We all remember last year when the,123
NA,Leader of the Opposition got up and gave a,123
NA,"speech and made some political points and,",123
NA,"at the end, said, 'By the way, the shadow",123
NA,Treasurer will deal with the costings in our,123
NA,propositions at the Press Club next,123
NA,Wednesday.' So we all waited with bated,123
NA,breath-what would the shadow Treasurer,123
NA,say the following Wednesday at the National,123
NA,"Press Club? Unfortunately, he got up and",123
NA,"said nothing. He said, 'Actually, that is the",123
NA,shadow finance minister's job.' So what we,123
NA,have is sort of the opposition equivalent of,123
NA,the Three Stooges: 'It was not me; it is him.',123
NA,"'No, it is not me; it is the other person.'",123
NA,The more important point is not even the,123
NA,gaffe of last year. The issue is this: good,123
NA,budgets are not centrally just about politics,123
NA,and parties. They have to be about good,123
NA,policy; they have to be about the future. So,123
NA,we need to have a good-faith debate here.,123
NA,This budget week is not just a test of the,123
NA,government; it is a test of the opposition. If,123
NA,the Liberal-National Party coalition have real,123
NA,"alternatives that they truly believe in, they",123
NA,should set them out. They should set out,123
NA,their alternatives-anything less than that is,123
NA,absolutely wasting the opportunity.,123
NA,On the issue of getting the budget back,123
NA,"into the black, the shadow Treasurer made",123
NA,some rather garrulous comments on 4 May,123
NA,and again on 6 May-indeed on any day that,123
NA,you talk to him. But on 4 May and 6 May he,123
NA,made it clear that he could get the budget,123
NA,back into the black by next year. When in,123
NA,Australian politics will there be any,123
NA,accountability for the comments of the,123
NA,shadow Treasurer? We all know that it took,123
NA,the Leader of the National Party to slap him,123
NA,down over his motormouth comments on,123
NA,"trusts, when the shadow Treasurer said that",123
NA,trusts should be taxed in the same way as,123
NA,companies. It did not take long for the red,123
NA,warning light in the National Party bunker to,123
NA,"go beep, beep, beep. And I have no doubt",123
NA,"that the Trussinator was on the phone saying,",123
NA,'This is not coalition policy.' I could just hear,123
NA,the Nationals going: 'Oh my god! The moose,123
NA,is loose; he is out again and he is making,123
NA,policy on the run'.,123
NA,I think that what we need to do here is to,123
NA,make sure. Perhaps we need a little bit of,123
NA,National Party iron rigour- the wheaty hand,123
NA,"in the glove-saying to Joe Hockey, 'Mate,",123
NA,what is our policy? What is our plan? What,123
NA,are we going to do? It is all right for us to,123
NA,"bag the government-okay, that is one thing.",123
NA,What are we going to do?' All we have is,123
NA,their costings from the election and we all,123
NA,remember the $11 billion black hole. Tony,123
NA,"Abbott fronted up, ran around the 36-hour-",123
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. Peter,123
NA,Slipper): Order! The Assistant Treasurer,123
NA,ought to refer to other honourable members,123
NA,by their titles.,123
Mr SHORTEN, Indeed. The Leader of,123
NA,"the Opposition, which he was then and",123
NA,"thankfully still is now, was running around",123
NA,on a 36-hour New South Wales law and,123
NA,"order binge, where he was clearly submitting",123
NA,himself as the candidate for premier in the,123
NA,"state election. But he did say, 'We have $50",123
NA,"billion in savings up our sleeves, in our gear.'",123
NA,"But after the election, when they were forced",123
NA,to demonstrate at least some degree of,123
NA,"financial rigour, there was an $11 billion",123
NA,costings black hole. Indeed when we were,123
NA,dealing with the floods package-very,124
NA,necessary to help with the reconstruction of,124
NA,"terribly flood affected areas-they said, 'We",124
NA,"can find cuts,' and we all know how that",124
NA,descended into farce. The shadow foreign,124
NA,"minister told the shadow leader, 'You are not",124
NA,"cutting foreign aid,' when in fact the",124
NA,opposition leader was trying to use One,124
NA,Nation's policy on cutting foreign aid. Of,124
NA,"course we do not talk about the war now, do",124
NA,we?,124
NA,Returning to what is most important: I,124
NA,have submitted to this House today what we,124
NA,are doing to tackle cost of living pressures.,124
NA,have submitted that this is a budget about,124
NA,getting us back into black by 2012-13. This,124
NA,is a budget which is about creating more jobs,124
NA,and spreading the benefits of the mining,124
NA,boom across all of the economy. We are an,124
NA,economy in transition; we need good policies,124
NA,in this country. But the challenge tomorrow,124
NA,"night for the opposition is saying, 'If we do",124
NA,"not like what you are doing, what is our",124
NA,plan?' The challenge for them is to,124
NA,demonstrate that they will not just keep this,124
NA,"economy in deficit, unlike yesterday's",124
NA,capable Swan budget.,124
Mr TRUSS ,Wide Bay-Leader of The,124
NA,Nationals) (15:50): The government's 2011,124
NA,federal budget is an absolute shambles.,124
NA,There is no plan; there is no vision; there are,124
NA,no solutions. The Treasurer told us at the,124
NA,beginning of his budget speech that it was a,124
NA,Labor budget with Labor values. Budgets,124
NA,"that are a shambles, without a plan and",124
NA,without a vision are Labor values. That is,124
NA,"what Labor budgets are all about. If,",124
NA,"perchance, the economic circumstances",124
NA,"improve, Labor have no idea how to deal",124
NA,with it. When tough decisions need to be,124
NA,"made to reduce government expenditure,",124
NA,they disguise the expenditure with the,124
NA,"traditional Labor value, the traditional Labor",124
NA,way of fixing problems: new taxes.,124
NA,We hear a lot about $22 billion worth of,124
NA,"so-called savings in this budget, but a third",124
NA,of that amount is actually new taxes. And the,124
NA,great big new carbon tax is not to be seen or,124
NA,heard of in this budget. It is the tax we dare,124
NA,"not speak of, except of course when it comes",124
NA,to funding the promotion campaign-the,124
NA,campaign for the tax that is not even,124
NA,mentioned in the budget.,124
NA,We all know that this budget will do,124
NA,nothing to deal with the problems of,124
NA,I struggling families. Labor's extra spending,124
NA,means greater pressure on interest rates and,124
NA,the near certainty of extra interest rate rises,124
NA,"this year. Inflation is on the march, but the",124
NA,budget does nothing to halt that advance.,124
NA,And over everything is the threat of the,124
NA,"carbon tax, which hangs like a sword over",124
NA,"the heads of every family, every small",124
NA,business and every community across the,124
NA,nation. This Labor budget is all about a,124
NA,"return to Labor's core values, with attacks on",124
NA,the people Labor always hate. Bring out the,124
NA,old class prejudices again-an assault on,124
NA,people who care for their own welfare by,124
NA,"taking out private health insurance, one of",124
NA,"Labor's pet hates, and on families who save",124
NA,up so that they can fund in advance their,124
NA,"children's university fees, also on Labor's hit",124
NA,"list. And what about single-income families,",124
NA,how they have been assaulted in this budget,124
NA,with removal of the dependent spouse rebate,124
NA,and the changes to the family tax benefits?,124
NA,All of this makes it more and more difficult,124
NA,for a family to decide that one of the parents,124
NA,"will stay home to raise the children. Indeed,",124
NA,"in future, under Labor's plan, the single-",124
NA,income family will become a thing of the,124
NA,past. It seems that is also one of Labor's core,124
NA,values.,124
NA,The other thing about Labor budgets is all,125
NA,"the overgrown rhetoric-grand statements,",125
NA,"commitments about the biggest this, the",125
NA,"biggest that, the largest programs of all",125
NA,kinds-but when you search through it all,125
NA,you find the numbers are not real. There is a,125
NA,$2.2 billion mental health strategy but they,125
NA,do not bother to mention the mental health,125
NA,programs they have axed to help fund it.,125
NA,They do not bother to mention that some of,125
NA,this is just restoring money they have taken,125
NA,away from programs like headspace. It is a,125
NA,big headline. That is what they are interested,125
NA,in. The absolute classic at this has always,125
NA,been the minister for infrastructure. When,125
NA,you read his press statements they always,125
NA,say 'the biggest road project of all times'. He,125
NA,has been well and truly caught out with his,125
NA,statements in relation to the Pacific,125
NA,Highway-a big banner headline 'More,125
NA,funding for the Pacific Highway':,125
NA,The Gillard government is prepared to increase,125
NA,investment in this road by $1 billion as a part,125
NA,the 2011-12 budget.,125
NA,Then he goes on to talk about what this extra,125
NA,funding will achieve. He makes it clear that,125
NA,there is an extra $1 billion in the budget for,125
NA,the Pacific Highway. He tried to defend,125
NA,himself in question time today when the,125
NA,member for Cowper quite rightly pointed out,125
NA,that this is not $1 billion extra for the Pacific,125
NA,Highway. This is not $1 billion worth of new,125
NA,money. He said the member for Cowper,125
NA,"should go back and read budget paper No. 2,",125
NA,which has all the details about this item. Let,125
NA,us go to page 267 of budget paper No. 2 and,125
NA,remember that Minister Albanese is claiming,125
NA,he is providing $1 billion of extra money for,125
NA,the Pacific Highway. Page 267 says of this,125
NA,$1.02 billion:,125
NA,"Of the contribution, $700 million has been",125
NA,previously provisioned for in the budget.,125
NA,"So of the $1.02 billion, $700 million has",125
NA,been previously provisioned. It is not new,125
NA,money at all. It is re-announcing the same,125
NA,money which was announced previously. He,125
NA,"did acknowledge that of the rest, $270",125
NA,million was in fact money which has been,125
NA,taken off other projects in New South Wales.,125
NA,So $970 million at least of this money is not,125
NA,new money at all. The next thing he went on,125
NA,to say was that this money was going to,125
NA,deliver us a better Pacific Highway but if,125
NA,"you read his press statement, he says:",125
NA,This extra funding will complete necessary,125
NA,detailed planning for the remaining sections of,125
NA,the highway.,125
NA,Detailed planning! It is not as though the,125
NA,minister went off on his own path on this,125
NA,one. That is also repeated in the budget,125
NA,document-a whole billion dollars spent on,125
NA,planning. Planning! They go even further by,125
NA,saying that if this money is matched by the,125
NA,New South Wales government further,125
NA,construction might be able to begin. They are,125
NA,waiting for the New South Wales,125
NA,its government to put up the money to actually,125
NA,of build the road. Yet the minister is trying to,125
NA,"take credit for it all. However, he has caught",125
NA,"himself out again because in 2009, when",125
NA,announcing the new N1 road network in,125
NA,"Australia, he said that the Commonwealth",125
NA,would pick up 100 per cent of the cost of,125
NA,building the Pacific Highway. He was letting,125
NA,the New South Wales government off their,125
NA,traditional fifty-fifty share. It seems that the,125
NA,"old destitute, hopeless Labor government in",125
NA,New South Wales was to be let off making,125
NA,"any contributions, but the moment they have",125
NA,been relieved of office he expects the new,125
NA,incoming coalition government to pick up 50,125
NA,per cent of the funding. So if there is going,125
NA,to be one centimetre of bitumen provided to,125
NA,the Pacific Highway in addition to what is,125
NA,planned as a result of this budget the minister,125
NA,says it has to be provided by New South,125
NA,Wales. This is the brave new investment.,125
NA,This is the new regional policy the,125
NA,Independents have been so willing to,125
NA,embrace. They are so quick to mouth the,125
NA,Labor rhetoric about new increased,126
NA,expenditure in the region.,126
NA,The regions are going to get another 100,126
NA,bureaucrats in the regional development,126
NA,department but they are not going to get any,126
NA,significant new expenditure. There is another,126
NA,announcement about $4.4 billion over 10,126
NA,years but nearly all of that money is,126
NA,"dependent upon there being a mining tax,",126
NA,and what a lose-lose situation this is for,126
NA,regional Australia. If you do not have a,126
NA,"mining tax, you do not get any of the money",126
NA,that has been promised to the Independents,126
NA,"and others for regional projects, but if you",126
NA,"do get the mining tax, you lose the jobs, the",126
NA,investment and the initiative that is necessary,126
NA,in regional communities to make them grow.,126
NA,This is Labor's lose-lose regional,126
NA,development policy. What they offered to the,126
NA,Independents and what is in this budget is,126
NA,less than what would have been delivered by,126
NA,a coalition government had we been elected.,126
NA,"It is less, but for the Independents Labor",126
NA,to bulk it up by bringing in the traditional,126
NA,"funding out of other portfolios, concentrating",126
NA,it all in a regional bucket and making it into,126
NA,a large number. Is anyone suggesting that,126
NA,there would not have been hospital,126
NA,"funding-extensions, construction-if this",126
NA,"new bucket had not been created? Of course,",126
NA,regional areas would have got something of a,126
NA,share. Are you suggesting there would not,126
NA,have been money for regional roads if it,126
NA,were not for this new bucket? All that has,126
NA,happened is that the titles on projects have,126
NA,been changed but there is no serious new,126
NA,money available for regional communities.,126
NA,What regional communities will have to,126
NA,"pay is a heavier share of the burden, the",126
NA,"changes to the fringe benefits tax, because",126
NA,country people have to travel further than,126
NA,people in the city. The tradies and the others,126
NA,who need their vehicles to travel around are,126
NA,now going to have the fringe benefits tax,126
NA,concessions cut. Those sorts of things will,126
NA,adversely affect regional areas.,126
NA,Look at the agriculture budget. What a sad,126
NA,and sorry sight that is. While Minister,126
NA,Albanese has scores of pages of press,126
NA,"releases, there are only two pages for the",126
NA,whole of the department of agriculture,126
NA,because there is nothing there. Another $32,126
NA,billion has been taken away from it and there,126
NA,is no new expenditure on quarantine. This,126
NA,budget strategy has utterly failed. It has,126
NA,utterly failed regional Australians. It will,126
NA,deliver nothing for our communities. A,126
NA,government who can think nothing more,126
NA,than to introduce these costs is truly,126
NA,delivering on Labor values. (Time expired),126
Mr BRADBURY ,Lindsay-,126
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer),126
NA,(16:00): I rise with great interest in being,126
NA,able to contribute to this matter of public,126
NA,"importance debate, although I find it",126
NA,tries somewhat hypocritical that the member for,126
NA,North Sydney would come forward and draw,126
NA,attention to one of the biggest contradictions,126
NA,in the budget response he has led for the,126
NA,opposition. As anyone who has followed any,126
NA,of the interviews that the member for North,126
NA,Sydney has given over the last 24 hours,126
NA,"would know, the contradiction is that, on the",126
NA,"one hand, he wants to tell everybody that the",126
NA,budget handed down last night was too,126
NA,savage and ripped away at the heart of so-,126
NA,"called middle-class welfare, as people out",126
NA,"there say, but, on the other hand, he wants to",126
NA,tell us that it was not nearly savage enough.,126
NA,It is somewhat confusing and somewhat,126
NA,hypocritical but the member for North,126
NA,"Sydney will get his opportunity, through his",126
NA,"leader, tomorrow night to spell out in clear",126
NA,detail exactly what this confused position,126
NA,will ultimately mean for the Australian,126
NA,people.,126
NA,I saw that the member for North Sydney,127
NA,raised the issue of cost-of-living pressures. I,127
NA,note that the issue of cost of living pressures,127
NA,has been raised with him on numerous,127
NA,occasions over the last couple of weeks in,127
NA,relation to specific measures that the,127
NA,government has indicated will provide relief,127
NA,to families from those cost of living,127
NA,pressures. On each occasion that any of these,127
NA,initiatives have been put to the member for,127
NA,"North Sydney, he has failed to commit",127
NA,himself and his party to supporting these,127
NA,measures to provide relief to those families,127
NA,facing these pressures. On each occasion,127
NA,when he has been asked whether or not he,127
NA,supports the government's initiatives the best,127
NA,he could do was to fail to agree to support,127
NA,the government's initiatives and respond by,127
NA,"saying the following, which I quote from",127
NA,Australian Agenda on 4 May:,127
NA,At this stage the best support,127
NA,give is to get the budget back to surplus as soon,127
NA,as possible and take some of the upward pressure,127
NA,off interest rates.,127
NA,Then on 8 May on the Insiders program he,127
NA,was asked the question again. I think it was,127
NA,Barrie Cassidy who tried to pin him down on,127
NA,whether or not he would support these,127
NA,measures which would provide relief to,127
NA,"families. Once again, he refused to confirm",127
NA,that he would support those measures and the,127
NA,best he could come up with was to say:,127
NA,"If you want to take pressure off families, if you",127
NA,"want to take upward pressure off interest rates,",127
NA,you have to get back to surplus as quickly as,127
NA,possible.,127
NA,We agree that you have to get back to,127
NA,surplus as quickly as possible. That is why,127
NA,the budget that the Treasurer handed down,127
NA,last night charted out a pathway for a return,127
NA,to surplus in 2012-13. I know we have heard,127
NA,from the member for North Sydney that he,127
NA,thinks that somehow he is going to deliver a,127
NA,surplus sooner and I guess we will all see,127
NA,whether or not that is possible when his,127
NA,leader comes forward and sets out his party's,127
NA,plans tomorrow night. I think we all wait,127
NA,with bated breath to see that fiscal,127
NA,consolidation. That clearly would be the,127
NA,fastest fiscal consolidation known to man if,127
NA,"that were to be achieved, but we will wait",127
NA,and see exactly how he intends to achieve,127
NA,that.,127
NA,So we have the member for North Sydney,127
NA,out there raising issues of concern about the,127
NA,cost of living pressures. I note that he has,127
NA,failed to acknowledge any of the measures,127
NA,and we will see tomorrow night whether he,127
NA,supports the measures that this government,127
NA,is proposing to ease those cost-of-living,127
NA,pressures. There are many. If you have,127
NA,"children in child care, for example, apart",127
NA,from having benefitted from the increase in,127
NA,the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to,127
NA,50 per cent that this government,127
NA,the Government can introduced-,127
Mr Haase, You want to freeze it.,127
Mr BRADBURY, The member opposite,127
NA,is so confused about these matters that he,127
NA,somehow thinks that this has something to,127
NA,do with family payments. I will come to the,127
NA,"family payments in a minute, but I am",127
NA,talking about the childcare tax rebate. We,127
NA,increased the rebate from 30 per cent to 50,127
NA,per cent for out-of-pocket expenses. In,127
NA,"addition to that, in this budget we are now",127
NA,providing families with a greater capacity to,127
NA,access those benefits sooner and in a more,127
NA,timely fashion. Those are the sorts of things,127
NA,you do if you want to relieve some of these,127
NA,cost of living pressures on families.,127
NA,The member opposite wanted to buy into,127
NA,the debate over family payments and the,127
NA,family tax benefit. I am sure that the member,127
NA,would be much more supportive of our,127
NA,proposition than the member for North,127
NA,Sydney has been. It is a proposition that,127
NA,seeks to provide parents with family tax,127
NA,benefit relief if they have teenage children,127
NA,who are continuing high school. This is one,128
NA,of the anachronisms of the system. It is,128
NA,"antiquated, it is old fashioned and it reflects",128
NA,time when not as many children went on to,128
NA,"study in years 11 and 12. As we know, more",128
NA,and more young people are doing that and,128
NA,we encourage that because ultimately it will,128
NA,"increase workforce participation, it will give",128
NA,those kids a better chance of getting a job,128
NA,and in the end they will end up with better,128
NA,"income. We encourage this, but the pressure",128
NA,that families have been feeling has been,128
NA,acute. That is why we have been committed,128
NA,to delivering an increase in the funding that,128
NA,is available through the family tax benefit for,128
NA,parents with teenage kids. For some families,128
NA,that will mean an improvement of up to,128
NA,"$4,000 a year. It is a significant improvement",128
NA,that will relieve those cost of living,128
NA,pressures.,128
NA,You do not hear anything on that today,128
NA,"from the opposition, but we did hear",128
NA,something on this point from the shadow,128
NA,Treasurer the other day when he came out,128
NA,and said it was 'curious.' As the Minister for,128
NA,"Families, Housing, Community Services and",128
NA,"Indigenous Affairs indicated today, his",128
NA,"position has become curiouser, curiouser and",128
NA,"curiouser. Unfortunately, he is so confused",128
NA,about it that none of us know where he,128
NA,"stands on this issue. I tell you what, this",128
NA,government will be proceeding with this,128
NA,reform. It will put more money in the,128
NA,pockets of families as they try to help their,128
NA,kids go on to higher studies. n addition to,128
NA,"that, we have expanded the availability of the",128
NA,education tax refund and one of the eligible,128
NA,items will now be school uniforms. This will,128
NA,provide relief to families who are facing cost,128
NA,"of living pressures. In addition to that, if you",128
NA,"are an apprentice, you will have the benefit",128
NA,of obtaining higher bonuses and more access,128
NA,to mentoring. If you are a tradie or a small,128
NA,"business, you will have access to the new",128
NA,"instant write-off up to $5,000, and we have",128
NA,expanded that to include utes and other,128
NA,a motor vehicles used by tradies and other,128
NA,"small businesses. In addition to that, we have",128
NA,invested a considerable amount of money in,128
NA,schools for children with disabilities which,128
NA,will help families already stressed and under,128
NA,financial pressure because of all the,128
NA,pressures they face raising children with,128
NA,disabilities. They will now have access to,128
NA,more assistance in their schools as a result of,128
NA,these measures.,128
NA,These are the very real and tangible things,128
NA,that were outlined in last night's budget by,128
NA,the government that will relieve some of,128
NA,those cost of living pressures. They build,128
NA,upon a record of a government that have,128
NA,delivered many improvements that have,128
NA,assisted with the cost of living pressures. We,128
NA,could mention the $46.7 million worth of tax,128
NA,"cuts between 2008-09 and 2011-12, the $3",128
NA,"billion to establish the education tax refund,",128
NA,the $1.6 million that was the enhancement in,128
NA,"the childcare tax rebate, not to mention our",128
NA,historic reforms to the pension-increasing,128
NA,the rate of the pension by $128 per fortnight,128
NA,for singles and $116 per fortnight for,128
NA,couples.,128
NA,"During this debate, we have had some",128
NA,discussion about interest rates and the,128
NA,opposition say that they believe the best,128
NA,thing you can do for families is to take,128
NA,pressure off interest rates. The best thing you,128
NA,can do to take pressure off interest rates is to,128
NA,not oppose the savings measures in this,128
NA,budget. The Leader of the Opposition has,128
NA,already indicated they will block the $3,128
NA,billion. Every savings measure those,128
NA,opposite block will put more pressure on,128
NA,interest rates. They will put more cost-of-,128
NA,living pressures on the very people whom,128
NA,this government are determined to help. We,128
NA,will secure the passage of this budget,128
NA,through the parliament because it is,129
NA,important that we do that to deliver relief,129
NA,from cost-of-living pressures. Every time the,129
NA,opposition want to block the $3 billion worth,129
NA,"of measures, they will be hurting the people",129
NA,who need relief.,129
NA,Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (16:10): The,129
NA,saddest thing about that 10-minute self-,129
NA,congratulation from the Parliamentary,129
NA,Secretary to the Treasurer is that he truly,129
NA,believes what he was given to say. This,129
NA,budget delivered last night fails on almost,129
NA,"every ground, and that is rare. It is a budget",129
NA,that fails in substance. It is a budget that,129
NA,betrays the Australian people. It is a budget,129
NA,that knowingly increases the cost-of-living,129
NA,pressures that Australian families and small,129
NA,"businesses face. Before last night's budget,",129
NA,Australian families and small businesses,129
NA,"knew for sure that cost-of-living pressures,",129
NA,which have increased in recent months and,129
NA,"years, would increase again thanks to the",129
NA,carbon tax. They did not know that before,129
NA,"the election, but they knew it for sure last",129
NA,night thanks to the Prime Minister's backflip.,129
NA,"They now know for sure, following last",129
NA,night's budget and the failure of the,129
NA,"Treasurer, that that will be matched with",129
NA,increases in interest rates which will increase,129
NA,even further cost-of-living pressures.,129
NA,The government's failure on the budget,129
NA,has been identified by commentators here in,129
NA,Canberra and right across Australia. Alan,129
NA,Kohler described it as a budget on a 'wing,129
NA,and a prayer'. You do not need to take our,129
NA,"word for it. For those backbenchers opposite,",129
NA,that respected economic commentator also,129
NA,said:,129
NA,Any decent CFO would be embarrassed by this,129
NA,budget. There has been an $8 billion blow-out,129
NA,this year's deficit since the Mid-Year Economic,129
NA,"and Fiscal Review last November, a $10 billion",129
NA,blow-out in next year's deficit. The return to,129
NA,"surplus the year after, requiring a $26 billion",129
NA,"turnaround in the bottom line in 12 months,",129
NA,simply ignores what is happening and plugging in,129
NA,the same economic parameters for 2012-13 as,129
NA,before.,129
NA,"Robert Gottliebson, whom colleagues quoted",129
NA,"in question time, made similar points.",129
NA,A lot has been said quite rightly about,129
NA,"debt. With this government, we know that",129
NA,the level of net government debt in dollar,129
NA,"terms is going to be incredibly high, north of",129
NA,$100 billion. In 1996 when we won,129
NA,"government from those opposite, we",129
NA,inherited a $96 billion debt. The Australian,129
NA,public are acutely aware of the cost of debt.,129
NA,They are acutely aware that the interest,129
NA,payments needed to service that debt is,129
NA,money that cannot be spent on day-to-day,129
NA,programs. They are acutely aware that the,129
NA,higher the level of net government debt the,129
NA,more pressure on interest rates. They are,129
NA,absolutely aware of that which is why it is,129
NA,like extracting teeth to get this Treasurer to,129
NA,name the figure for which he is responsible.,129
NA,Today he stated that figure. He mumbled it,129
NA,out. Do not take my word for the fact that,129
NA,this is a deceitful Treasurer; take the word of,129
NA,"the former finance minister, who has written",129
NA,in his book and has belled the cat on the fact,129
NA,"that this tactic, first in 2009, of not",129
NA,mentioning the budget deficit figure in the,129
NA,budget speech and trying to conceal the,129
NA,dollar figure of net government debt by,129
NA,"referring only to the percentage of GDP was,",129
NA,"in fact, a deliberate tactic. He has written",129
NA,about it in his book. What he said-and I,129
NA,would like those opposite to do what they,129
NA,"normally do and howl interjections, because",129
NA,you will be interjecting against your own,129
NA,former colleague-was:,129
NA,Their-,129
NA,"in former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the",129
NA,"Treasurer, Wayne Swan-",129
NA,understandable concern about handing a,129
NA,political weapon to their opponents-,129
NA,in naming this figure-,129
NA,was more than offset by the ridicule that,130
NA,apparent attempt to deny reality invited.,130
NA,It was an attempt to deny reality. That tells,130
NA,us a couple of things about this dishonest,130
NA,Treasurer. The public have had many,130
NA,examples over the last three or four years of,130
NA,where this government cannot be trusted.,130
NA,When we see the Treasurer refuse to name,130
NA,"that figure, he is doing so to deliberately",130
NA,conceal it from the Australian people. He,130
NA,"mumbled it out in question time today, but",130
NA,last night when interviewed on Sky Agenda,130
NA,we had the incredible spectacle where he was,130
NA,asked by David Speers about the level of net,130
NA,government debt. David Speers said: 'What,130
NA,sort of peak debt are we now looking at?',130
NA,The Treasurer responded: 'The peak of net,130
NA,debt will be 7.2 per cent in 2011-12.' David,130
NA,Speers asked: 'But how many in dollar,130
NA,terms? How much in dollar terms?' Wayne,130
NA,"Swan replied: 'Well it's relatively modest,'",130
NA,"and listen to this, 'I haven't got the figure on",130
NA,me at the moment.',130
NA,This Treasurer would have you believe,130
NA,that he is so incompetent that he does not,130
NA,know the dollar figure of the net debt for,130
NA,which he is responsible in the budget he has,130
NA,just delivered to parliament. In the contest,130
NA,between telling the truth and concealing the,130
NA,level of that debt from the public he would,130
NA,have you believe that he has no idea-and,130
NA,my friend and colleague with me at the table,130
NA,"would agree, we think he has mostly no idea.",130
NA,But even we cannot accept that he would not,130
NA,"know that figure, if only for the reason that",130
NA,"we know from the exhibit released last week,",130
NA,"the book of the former finance minister, that",130
NA,this was a deliberate tactic to conceal the,130
NA,level of the debt. The Treasurer even,130
NA,"knowing that still ploughs on, like some sort",130
NA,"of out-of-control lawn mower over wet grass,",130
NA,"with the same inane, ridiculous strategy",130
NA,thinking that the Australian people will,130
NA,somehow be prevented from knowing that,130
NA,this net government debt will peak at $107,130
NA,billion. We even had the finance minister,130
NA,"today, again, on Adelaide radio try and",130
NA,refuse to reveal the figure. She could only do,130
NA,it for a couple of answers and we had to ask,130
NA,the Treasurer today to state the figure.,130
NA,The $107 billion-the $106 billion and,130
NA,some change in the Treasurer's view-is the,130
NA,most generous construction that can be put,130
NA,"on it. That is, of course-as my friend the",130
NA,"member for Groom knows, having been a",130
NA,minister in the previous government-the,130
NA,"level of debt, but is not the level of fiscal",130
NA,deterioration. This government did not start,130
NA,with a debt position; it started with savings.,130
NA,"In fact, it started in 2007-08 with $44 billion",130
NA,in the bank. This is like having a credit card,130
NA,with $44 billion in it and ready to go before,130
NA,you rack-up a dollar of debt. It is a $150,130
NA,billion deterioration.,130
NA,I was looking through the Treasurer's first,130
NA,budget. Every budget speech from the,130
NA,Treasurer has had some element of,130
NA,deception. We had temporary deficits one,130
NA,"year; remember? In his first budget, when",130
NA,you look down at the same table that lists the,130
NA,level of net government debt-on page 10.8,130
NA,in this year's budget for those opposite-you,130
NA,would not have guessed that what was,130
NA,"projected for this time, 2011-12, was $106",130
NA,"billion, but in savings, not debt. He has",130
NA,managed to transpose the whole show.,130
Ms SMYTH ,La Trobe) (16:20): I am,130
NA,very pleased to speak this afternoon in this,130
NA,matter of public importance debate about the,130
NA,"cost of living, and it is very good to see that",130
NA,the opposition has decided to play catch-up,130
NA,in today's MPI because yesterday they,130
NA,certainly had no interest in the economy or,130
NA,budget settings and the way that it impacts,130
NA,on ordinary Australians. They had no interest,130
NA,in the way that this government is,130
NA,responding to the cost-of-living pressures,130
NA,that face Australians. They had no questions,131
NA,"to ask and, frankly, today's efforts by the",131
NA,opposition in question time were not terribly,131
NA,much better.,131
NA,This afternoon there is apparently a,131
NA,newfound interest in these issues from the,131
NA,other side of the chamber. Those of us on,131
NA,this side are extremely happy to talk about,131
NA,the way that this government is responding,131
NA,to the real needs of Australians through this,131
NA,budget and how we have responded to it,131
NA,since coming to office. Let us have a look at,131
NA,some of the practical measures that this,131
NA,government has been responsible for. In,131
NA,skills and training we have been ensuring,131
NA,that skills and training opportunities for,131
NA,young people in electorates such as mine are,131
NA,available to ensure that they have productive,131
NA,working lives and to enable them to meet,131
NA,living expenses. In my electorate of La,131
NA,Trobe the most recent commitments made in,131
NA,"last night's budget mean that around 2,500",131
NA,apprentices in my electorate alone will be,131
NA,able to benefit from Labor's investment in,131
NA,"apprenticeships, which will enable more",131
NA,people in my electorate to ultimately get,131
NA,skilled jobs. Our commitments in relation to,131
NA,families with children have been fairly,131
NA,significant since coming to office and were,131
NA,expanded upon in yesterday's budget. We are,131
NA,providing families with children with the,131
NA,support that they need through increases to,131
NA,"family tax benefit part A. Around 5,000",131
NA,families in my electorate are affected by this,131
NA,commitment. They will receive an extra,131
NA,"$4,200 per child aged between 16 and 19",131
NA,"years old. I am sure that those 5,000 local",131
NA,families will appreciate the meaningful and,131
NA,practical effects of our commitment to,131
NA,responding to their cost-of-living pressures.,131
NA,During its term of office the Howard,131
NA,government certainly talked the talk of,131
NA,"supporting pensioners and older Australians,",131
NA,"but it took this government, in its first",131
NA,and against the backdrop of a global,131
NA,"financial crisis, to make a meaningful",131
NA,commitment to pensioners in real and,131
NA,financial terms. We have supported,131
NA,pensioners with a historic increase in the,131
NA,pension. Since September 2009 we have,131
NA,increased the age pension by $128 per,131
NA,fortnight for singles and $116 per fortnight,131
NA,for couples. We have also delivered an,131
NA,improved pension work bonus so that age,131
NA,pensioners can hold onto an extra $125 per,131
NA,week of their income from work. These are,131
NA,"practical measures, real measures, things that",131
NA,the Howard government refused to do during,131
NA,more than a decade in office.,131
NA,"Meaningfully, since coming to office we",131
NA,have provided tax cuts three years in a row-,131
NA,$46.7 billion in cuts. We have also,131
NA,committed $1.25 billion in this budget to,131
NA,delivering up to $300 more in the low,131
NA,income tax offset during the year. We,131
NA,established a $300 billion education tax,131
NA,rebate and in this year's budget we have,131
NA,extended that rebate by $460 million to cover,131
NA,"school uniforms. Again, this is something the",131
NA,"Howard government, during a decade in",131
NA,"office, had absolutely no interest in pursuing.",131
NA,"We have increased the childcare rebate,",131
NA,"by $1.6 billion, from 30 per cent to 50 per",131
NA,cent of out-of-pocket expenses. We have,131
NA,made the childcare rebate more flexible to,131
NA,allow families to access those benefits,131
NA,sooner and we have implemented a historic,131
NA,Paid Parental Leave scheme so that parents,131
NA,can be supported after the birth of a child.,131
NA,We have also committed nearly half a billion,131
NA,dollars under the Teen Dental Plan. These,131
NA,policies and reforms run right across areas,131
NA,"from childcare to education, taxation,",131
NA,"pensions, superannuation and skills",131
NA,development. They are meaningful measures,131
NA,"that are tangible to ordinary Australians, and",131
NA,certainly to members of my electorate.,131
NA,With the announcements made in,131
NA,"term yesterday's budget, Australians will know",131
NA,that we have increased our already,132
NA,significant commitments to boosting,132
NA,employment and making sure that all,132
NA,Australians are given an opportunity to,132
NA,participate in work and take home an,132
NA,income. We on this side of the chamber,132
NA,know that these are things that respond to,132
NA,cost-of-living pressures. They are things,132
NA,"which give options to working people,",132
NA,"pensioners, families with children and to",132
NA,young people looking to develop skills and,132
NA,ensure they have a meaningful job and,132
NA,career. They are things which give them the,132
NA,opportunity to meet cost-of-living pressures.,132
NA,In addition to doing all of these things in,132
NA,context of the financial crisis and the natural,132
NA,"disasters around the country, which have had",132
NA,"a significant impact on our budget measures,",132
NA,we understand the need to make significant,132
NA,and transformative economic changes. That,132
NA,is why our budget will ensure that there are,132
NA,settings in place to put downward pressure,132
NA,on inflation. We are investing in our,132
NA,workforce. We are investing in,132
NA,infrastructure. I notice that in this matter of,132
NA,public importance discussion the Leader of,132
NA,the Nationals declined to mention any,132
NA,significant means by which those on the,132
NA,other side of the House would contribute to,132
NA,our national infrastructure development and,132
NA,the jobs associated with any such,132
NA,development.,132
NA,We know that the most important thing,132
NA,"for Australian families, for all Australians",132
NA,and for the future of our country is ensuring,132
NA,that more Australians than ever have the,132
NA,security and dignity of work. That is why we,132
NA,"acted swiftly to protect 200,000 jobs in the",132
NA,"face of the global financial crisis, an event",132
NA,which seems to have escaped the,132
NA,opposition's interest and has been excised,132
NA,from their collective memory. Our,132
NA,commitment to ensuring the security and,132
NA,dignity of work for working Australians is,132
NA,reflected in our proudest achievement in,132
NA,"government: the creation of over 750,000",132
NA,jobs since coming to office. It is also why we,132
NA,have the settings in place for the economy to,132
NA,"generate around 500,000 new jobs within the",132
NA,next couple of years. This sets the opposition,132
NA,in stark contrast to us. They made no effort,132
NA,to support our efforts to stimulate the,132
NA,economy in the face of the global financial,132
NA,crisis. Jobs were at the bottom of their list of,132
NA,priorities.,132
NA,The opposition was asleep at the wheel,132
NA,during the last resources boom. We are not,132
NA,and we will not be. We are determined to,132
NA,the ensure that the minerals resource rental tax,132
NA,will give all Australians a better share in the,132
NA,proceeds that come from our mineral wealth.,132
NA,This is something which will ensure that all,132
NA,Australians can profit from those mineral,132
NA,"wealth gains, that there is a level of equity",132
NA,for Australians and that we can support,132
NA,significant programs into the future.,132
NA,"Despite all these things, the opposition are",132
NA,yet to present anything constructive or,132
NA,positive which would indicate how they,132
NA,would respond to the cost-of-living pressures,132
NA,which they are seemingly concerned about,132
NA,"today-though perhaps not tomorrow,",132
NA,because they were certainly not interested in,132
NA,them yesterday during question time. On the,132
NA,"one hand, the opposition assert that they will",132
NA,restore the budget to surplus by next year; on,132
NA,"the other hand, they continue with their",132
NA,boundless spending commitments. I know,132
NA,that those spending commitments were made,132
NA,with gay abandon in my electorate during the,132
NA,last federal election campaign. There were a,132
NA,variety of election 'commitments' made by,132
NA,the former Liberal member for La Trobe,132
NA,which were not included in the costings of,132
NA,the coalition prior to the election. There were,132
NA,more than $80 million worth of election,132
NA,commitments in my electorate alone. This,132
NA,indicates the level of fiscal responsibility,133
NA,runs right the way down from the leaders of,133
NA,the coalition to their individual members and,133
NA,candidates in local elections. Given that the,133
NA,opposition will make a swifter return to,133
NA,surplus while making these spending,133
NA,"commitments, and not saying what their",133
NA,"spending cuts are likely to be, presumably",133
NA,someone on the other side has the colour,133
NA,"copier out, because the only way they can",133
NA,achieve those two ends is to start printing,133
NA,money. e know what happened the last time,133
NA,they tried to achieve spending cuts at the,133
NA,same time as making their election,133
NA,commitments. We know that there was an,133
NA,$11 billion black hole that was,133
NA,independently verified and tested. We know,133
NA,that the opposition has form when it comes,133
NA,to inaccurate representations of their,133
NA,"economic commitments, and I certainly",133
NA,expect that to be the case tomorrow night.,133

NA,Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters,134
NA,for inquiry and report by 30 September 2011:,134

Mr GRAY ,Brand-Special Minister of,134
NA,State for the Public Service and Integrity and,134
NA,Special Minister of State) (16:33): I move:,134
NA,That the amendments be agreed to.,134
NA,As members would recall the Electoral and,134
NA,Referendum Amendment (Provisional,134
NA,Voting) Bill 2011 will repeal the,134
NA,requirements for provisional voters to,134
NA,provide evidence of identity as a,134
NA,precondition of their votes being included in,134
NA,the count for an election. This requirement,134
NA,BILLS was put in place by the previous government,134
NA,in 2006. It resulted in a situation where,134
NA,provisional votes were dealt with in a way,134
NA,2011 that was inconsistent with the treatment of,134
NA,"other types of declaration votes-namely,",134
NA,"absent, postal and pre-poll votes. By",134
NA,repealing the requirement for provisional,134
NA,"voters to provide evidence of identity, all",134
NA,declaration votes will be treated equally.,134
NA,The bill replaces the requirement to,134
NA,provide evidence of identity with a test,134
NA,similar to that used in previous elections.,134
NA,The test provides for the divisional returning,134
NA,officer to compare the signature on the,134
NA,provisional vote envelope with the signature,134
NA,of the elector on previously lodged,134
NA,enrolment records if there is any doubt as to,134
NA,the bona fides of the elector.,134
NA,This bill is supported by the Electoral,134
NA,"Commission, which in its submissions to the",134
NA,inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on,134
NA,Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal,134
NA,election and matters related thereto,134
NA,recommended that the requirement for the,134
NA,production of evidence of identity by,134
NA,provisional voters should be repealed. The,135
NA,government will be supporting the,135
NA,amendments to the bill moved by Senator,135
NA,Xenophon and agreed to by the Senate.,135
NA,These amendments provide for the divisional,135
NA,returning officer if not satisfied that a,135
NA,signature on an envelope is that of the elector,135
NA,must make all reasonable attempts to contact,135
NA,the elector to require them to provide,135
NA,evidence of identity.,135
NA,We see these amendments as providing a,135
NA,desirable safety net to prevent what would be,135
NA,otherwise valid additional votes from being,135
NA,discarded. They are a substantive,135
NA,"improvement to the bill, and we will support",135
NA,them. I commend the bill to the House.,135
NA,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar),135
NA,(16:35): The opposition is supporting this,135
NA,"amendment, as we did in the Senate, for the",135
NA,following reason. When we amended the,135
NA,legislation and put in place that those people,135
NA,wishing to cast a provisional vote should,135
NA,provide proof of identity we did so to protect,135
NA,the integrity of the roll. The minister makes,135
NA,the case that that meant we treated,135
NA,provisional votes as declaration votes,135
NA,"different from other declaration votes, but of",135
NA,"course the government by its own hand, by",135
NA,allowing pre-poll votes to be dealt with on,135
NA,"the evening of the count, instead of being",135
NA,"dealt with as they previously were, means",135
NA,that those declaration votes are already dealt,135
NA,with differently.,135
NA,"We were concerned, and so opposed the",135
NA,change to the legislation that would do away,135
NA,with proof of identity. Senator Xenophon's,135
NA,amendment will make more work for the,135
NA,Electoral Commission and I would have,135
NA,"preferred it, and the opposition would have",135
NA,"preferred it, if the responsibility had",135
NA,remained with the individual to ensure that,135
NA,they brought their proof of identity. I would,135
NA,point out that in the 2010 election,135
NA,somewhere between 75 and 80 per cent of,135
NA,people who wished to cast a provisional vote,135
NA,did so by providing that proof of identity. So,135
NA,that was an improvement over the 2007,135
NA,"position. Clearly, it was becoming accepted",135
NA,by those who wished to cast that sort of vote.,135
NA,By supporting the amendment as moved by,135
NA,Senator Xenophon it does mean that the,135
NA,concept of the need for a provisional voter to,135
NA,provide a proof of identity is an important,135
NA,one. Also I think it is important to recap as to,135
NA,why a person cast a provisional vote. The,135
NA,first point is that you were not found to be on,135
NA,the roll when you presented yourself. The,135
NA,second is that somebody had already voted in,135
NA,your name. The third is that the DRO simply,135
NA,did not like the look of you. The fourth is,135
NA,"that you are on the confidential, secret roll",135
NA,because of security or other reasons that are,135
NA,acceptable. The way the government had,135
NA,drafted its amending bill meant that it was,135
NA,simply saying that the DRO had to compare,135
NA,the signature on the envelope with the,135
NA,existing signature. It is quite possible and,135
NA,indeed probable that in many instances there,135
NA,was no signature to compare it too. In the,135
NA,state election in New South Wales they had a,135
NA,similar provision where they had begun the,135
NA,process of automatic enrolment so there,135
NA,would be no signature because people were,135
NA,automatically put on the roll. So we believe,135
NA,that the concept of returning to the,135
NA,legislation the requirement for proof of,135
NA,identity is a step in the right direction. We,135
NA,would still at a future time in government,135
NA,revisit this because we believe it is the only,135
NA,way that you can adequately protect the,135
NA,integrity of the roll. The Electoral,135
NA,"Commissioner, when he put in his",135
NA,submission to the Joint Standing Committee,135
NA,"on Electoral Matters, or JSCEM, made it",135
NA,"quite clear that one of the key parts, if not the",135
NA,"key part, of his task was to protect the",135
NA,integrity of the roll. We do see cases of,135
NA,multiple voting and we see that they are not,135
NA,"followed up, and those are issues that we will",135
NA,be addressing in that committee. But for the,136
NA,"purposes of this bill and this amendment, I",136
NA,say very firmly that returning to the,136
NA,legislation the concept that a provisional,136
NA,voter can be required to produce proof of,136
NA,identity is a step in the right direction.,136

NA,Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (16:44): As I,137
NA,"was saying earlier today, the coalition",137
NA,requires a firm but fair system to ensure that,137
NA,those in receipt of income support who can,137
NA,work have a responsibility to look for work,137
NA,and contribute back to the society that,137
NA,supports them. In addition to this they need,137
NA,to recognise that welfare is a temporary,137
NA,safety net and not a lifestyle choice-a hand,137
NA,"up, not a handout.",137
NA,"On the other hand, in 2008 the Rudd",137
NA,Labor government watered down mutual,137
NA,"obligation, introducing their no show, no pay",137
NA,"compliance model, which saw job seekers",137
NA,docked a day's welfare payment for failing to,137
NA,attend interviews. The department and the,137
NA,minister were writing to providers asking,137
NA,them to be more lenient on those who,137
NA,"breached the rules. Since then, the coalition",137
NA,has advocated for more stringent and,137
NA,appropriate compliance mechanisms as,137
NA,"Labor's no show, no pay compliance model",137
NA,has been a failure. It is clear that there,137
NA,neither a real financial disincentive for job,137
NA,seekers to comply with their activity test,137
NA,"requirements, nor an enforced administration",137
NA,of this scheme.,137
NA,This current Labor government has also,137
NA,failed job seekers by increasing the amount,137
NA,of time a job seeker spends out of work and,137
NA,unengaged in activities like Work for the,137
NA,Dole. This further increases their separation,137
NA,from the workforce as they are not engaging,137
NA,in job-like activities and are unable to get,137
NA,into a routine. Let me remind members of,137
NA,"this House that, as was the case with border",137
NA,"protection, the Howard government had a",137
NA,proven formula for Work for the Dole. New,137
NA,figures reveal the coalition's Work for the,137
NA,Dole program is being killed off under this,137
NA,"federal Labor government, with 3,000",137
NA,participants slashed from the scheme in the,137
NA,"last eight months of 2010. Since 2007, when",137
NA,the Labor government started withering,137
NA,"away Work for the Dole, they have increased",137
NA,long-term unemployment under their passive,137
NA,"welfare model, where people are required to",137
NA,be unemployed for 12 months or more before,137
NA,this Labor government will fund a work,137
NA,experience activity. Evidence also suggests,137
NA,that the longer someone is out of the,137
NA,workforce it becomes less likely that they,137
NA,will work again. Now the Gillard Labor,137
NA,government are looking at slowly bringing,137
NA,back past Liberal government policies. The,137
NA,coalition has strongly advocated that Work,137
NA,for the Dole should become mandatory for,137
NA,people under 50 who have been receiving,137
NA,unemployment benefits for more than six,137
NA,months.,137
NA,The Social Security Legislation,137
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,137
NA,has a number of key points which should be,137
NA,"noted. Firstly, it seeks to introduce tougher",137
NA,compliance measures for job seekers who,137
NA,"have activity test requirements. Secondly, it",137
NA,was will suspend income support payments for,137
NA,job seekers who fail to attend an appointment,137
NA,or activity like Work for the Dole without a,137
NA,reasonable excuse given in advance. When,137
NA,the job seeker does attend a rescheduled,137
NA,appointment their payment will be reinstated,137
NA,with back pay. Where the job seeker fails to,137
NA,attend the rescheduled meeting and fails to,137
NA,provide an adequate excuse then payment,137
NA,will be suspended until they do attend an,137
NA,appointment. No back pay will be payable,137
NA,"for this period. Thirdly, reasonable excuse",137
NA,"provisions will also be tightened, so that",137
NA,even if a job seeker has a reasonable excuse,137
NA,for not attending an appointment or activity,137
NA,on the day it will not be accepted if they,137
NA,could have given advance notice that they,137
NA,could not attend and failed to do so.,137
NA,I note that there have been some concerns,137
NA,received on this bill from various community,137
NA,groups outside my electorate. These include,137
NA,that this legislation is too punitive and that it,137
NA,fails to clarify the circumstances in which,137
NA,job seekers will not be required to give prior,138
NA,notice of their absence. The coalition is,138
NA,satisfied that the wording of the legislation,138
NA,such that if a job seeker does have a valid,138
NA,reason for missing an appointment and was,138
NA,not in a position to advise the provider,138
NA,beforehand then their payment will be,138
NA,"immediately reinstated. Like the coalition,",138
NA,the people of my electorate are supportive of,138
NA,Work for the Dole and mutual obligation. In,138
NA,"Solomon, as in many other electorates",138
NA,"around the nation, there are a range of",138
NA,community projects where unemployed,138
NA,people can contribute back to the society that,138
NA,supports them.,138
NA,"In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the",138
NA,support of the coalition for this bill. I hope,138
NA,that these reforms will do as intended and,138
NA,that all job seekers will benefit from moving,138
NA,from welfare to work. My only concern is to,138
NA,ensure that the administration of these,138
NA,reforms is carefully implemented so as to not,138
NA,to bring an additional burden to the already,138
NA,stretched Centrelink staff.,138
Mr HAYES ,Fowler-Government,138
NA,Whip) (16:49): I join with others in rising to,138
NA,support the Social Security Legislation,138
NA,"Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,",138
NA,because it is quite frankly what it takes to do,138
NA,something positive in affecting people,138
NA,peoples lives through employment. The,138
NA,Gillard government certainly,138
NA,"employment participation seriously, because",138
NA,we know the positive impact that having a,138
NA,job has on somebody's life. We know also,138
NA,that there are deleterious effects on the lives,138
NA,of people who do not have the opportunity to,138
NA,work. Whilst we wish to do everything we,138
NA,can to encourage people to take up the,138
NA,"challenge of getting a job, at the same time",138
NA,we are a government of compassion and I,138
NA,think we do reflect that long-held Australian,138
NA,principle of lending a helping hand to people,138
NA,"in need, particularly when people in various",138
NA,circumstances are doing it tough. Getting,138
NA,is that balance right-I suppose therein is the,138
NA,conundrum. What we have before us in this,138
NA,bill is an honest attempt to ensure that that,138
NA,balance is right. Through the amendments in,138
NA,"the legislation, it has achieved the right",138
NA,balance in supporting those who are doing it,138
NA,tough in our community and in encouraging,138
NA,workforce participation by providing an,138
NA,incentive for those people to go the extra,138
NA,mile in gaining a job.,138
NA,Over the past few days we have heard a,138
NA,lot from the Prime Minister and Treasurer,138
NA,about the importance of jobs. The issue of,138
NA,jobs was front and centre of the budget that,138
NA,"was introduced yesterday Nevertheless, our",138
NA,unemployment rate is the envy of the world,138
NA,and is something Australians should be,138
NA,"proud of, something I think we have all",138
NA,collectively worked very hard to achieve and,138
NA,something that we should continue to,138
NA,improve to ensure that we continue to enjoy,138
NA,the fruits of our economic prosperity.,138
NA,I think Wayne Swan got it right when he,138
NA,said there is not an Australian to waste. We,138
NA,"have all got a role to play in this, and one of",138
NA,the things we can try to do is ensure that we,138
NA,have full workplace participation.,138
NA,Yesterday's budget was all about maximising,138
NA,Australia's employment potential to continue,138
NA,takes our growth. It included essential training,138
NA,programs and incentives for a wide sector of,138
NA,"the community, from young apprentices to",138
NA,people on disability support. In my electorate,138
NA,"alone, these programs will have an enormous",138
NA,"impact. I do know that, for instance, Hoxton",138
NA,Industries provides employment,138
NA,opportunities for over 100 people with,138
NA,disabilities. It has been operating in my,138
NA,electorate since 1969 and is doing a fantastic,138
NA,job. I try to visit them on a reasonably,138
NA,"regular basis and Nicole Bruce, the general",138
NA,"manager, and all those involved in the",139
NA,supervisory team of Hoxton Industries do a,139
NA,great job in providing opportunity for people,139
NA,with disabilities. It is good to say that last,139
NA,night they were recognised by being awarded,139
NA,$1.1 million to continue their great work in,139
NA,south-west Sydney.,139
NA,I have often said in this place that people,139
NA,"are not necessarily having the best of days,",139
NA,and I admit I have one or two of those. But,139
NA,go and visit this place and here are people,139
NA,who have been dealt a pretty hard hand in,139
NA,life. It always impresses me that what they,139
NA,want to do is to turn up for work. They want,139
NA,to feel that they are wanted. They want to,139
NA,feel that their services are appreciated. They,139
NA,want to feel that they have a sense of worth.,139
NA,do not mind admitting that when you are,139
NA,"feeling a bit down you go there and, I tell",139
NA,"you what, Mr Deputy Speaker, it does lift",139
NA,your spirits to see these people who really,139
NA,want to come to work and want to engage in,139
NA,"talking to you about everything else,",139
NA,including the football. But they genuinely,139
NA,enjoy the opportunity of going to work,139
NA,because it actually fulfils something in their,139
NA,lives. I am very proud to be part of a,139
NA,government that can recognise that and,139
NA,proud of the $1.1 million that has just been,139
NA,"delivered to Hoxton Industries, amongst",139
NA,many others. I have got to say that when I go,139
NA,to various functions with the local Chamber,139
NA,"of Commerce, whether it be in Liverpool or",139
NA,"Cabramatta or elsewhere, as I have indicated",139
NA,"to many employers, if you are not going to",139
NA,"jeopardise your bottom line, if you are not",139
NA,going to cut short your return to your,139
NA,"shareholders, if you can actually direct work",139
NA,to places such as Hoxton Industries that,139
NA,provide opportunities for people with,139
NA,"disabilities, that is a very good thing to do",139
NA,"for your community. As I say, I am very",139
NA,proud of what they achieve and I will,139
NA,continue to work as closely as I can to,139
NA,support their interests because I know that,139
NA,they do a fantastic job for all of us.,139
NA,But on the other side of the coin we need,139
NA,to ensure that our welfare system is also,139
NA,encouraging those that can work to do so.,139
NA,"We need to provide, I suppose it is fair to",139
NA,"say, a carrot and stick approach which",139
NA,reflects how seriously this government takes,139
NA,the issue of workforce participation. Clearly,139
NA,on any reading of this amendment it does,139
NA,just that. As part of the Modernising,139
NA,"Australia's Welfare System policy,",139
NA,"announced in August 2010, the government",139
NA,gave a commitment to introduce tougher,139
NA,rules for job seekers from July 2011. These,139
NA,measures will apply to all job seekers on,139
NA,"I participation benefits, including parents,",139
NA,though it will not impact on family,139
NA,"payments, which is an important element of",139
NA,the amendment.,139
NA,The crux of this amendment is that it,139
NA,imposes financial penalties on job seekers,139
NA,"who fail to comply with appointments, or",139
NA,"mandated activities such as training, without",139
NA,a reasonable excuse. Once the job seeker re-,139
NA,"engages, payments will be restored. I think",139
NA,that is probably a fair balance. If a job seeker,139
NA,is successful in obtaining a job and does not,139
NA,"report to work, we know what happens then.",139
NA,They do not get paid and more than likely,139
NA,they get sacked. There is an aspect to this of,139
NA,making sure that this also builds upon the co-,139
NA,responsibilities that apply in respect of,139
NA,welfare payments. In our society we do look,139
NA,after people who find themselves in hard,139
NA,"times, we do look after people who fall",139
NA,"through the cracks, and we help them",139
NA,"remediate their position, help them to get",139
NA,back. But it does require a measure of self-,139
NA,help in all that as well. So if somebody does,139
NA,"not turn up for their appointments, does not",139
NA,undertake training they have been required to,139
NA,"do, the Commonwealth will not continue",139
NA,with their payments until such time as they,139
NA,"re-engage. On behalf of those we represent,",139
NA,we are responsible for administering the,140
NA,"public purse, so that is a fair thing. It",140
NA,on the government's election commitment to,140
NA,introduce tougher rules for job seekers.,140
NA,There is a need for a tightening of the,140
NA,"system, and this government has shown that",140
NA,it is up to the task. The Disney report,140
NA,released in September 2010 says just that. It,140
NA,sought the tightening up of the regime,140
NA,around participation payments to encourage,140
NA,people to engage in a level of self-help with,140
NA,a view to obtaining a job.,140
NA,This amendment will also simplify the,140
NA,system for job seekers so that they can focus,140
NA,"on their most important task, and that has got",140
NA,to be finding a job. It is going to be a,140
NA,situation where people will want to,140
NA,participate. They will need to attend the,140
NA,interviews which have been arranged for,140
NA,them by their job search agency and they,140
NA,will need to undertake the training that has,140
NA,been mandated to help them become,140
NA,employable. I know this is stating the,140
NA,"obvious, but this is trying to help people help",140
NA,themselves.,140
NA,I am proud to represent the electorate of,140
NA,Fowler in the south-west of Sydney and I,140
NA,know this will be of benefit to people in my,140
NA,electorate. I am not terribly proud of the fact,140
NA,that we have one of the highest youth,140
NA,unemployment rates in the country. We need,140
NA,to ensure that young people between the ages,140
NA,of 15 and 24 are engaged in either education,140
NA,"or employment, because we all know what",140
NA,the answer is if they are left on long-term,140
NA,unemployment; the answer is that they stay,140
NA,on it. This is trying to provide the incentive,140
NA,"not to fall into that trap, because of what it",140
NA,means for them and for our communities in,140
NA,this country.,140
NA,"We know that, by and large, people are",140
NA,keen to work. They are keen to work hard.,140
NA,They are keen to have their labours,140
NA,appreciated. They want to participate in the,140
NA,delivers workforce and they are keen for the,140
NA,opportunities that are being provided for,140
NA,them under these programs. We have just got,140
NA,to make sure that there is a certain amount of,140
NA,disciplined balance that goes into achieving,140
NA,"that. Unfortunately, there are also some",140
NA,"people who have been left behind. Clearly,",140
NA,they were left behind under the,140
NA,"administration of the Howard government,",140
NA,who failed to invest in skills and,140
NA,apprenticeship training when they had the,140
NA,opportunity to do so. The Howard,140
NA,government were very good at using the,140
NA,"stick, there is no question about that, and",140
NA,taking payments away from people who did,140
NA,not comply. They did it. But what they failed,140
NA,to do was invest in skills development and,140
NA,training support needs for the unemployed.,140
NA,They failed to invest in having people job,140
NA,ready. They failed to do all that before we,140
NA,got hit with a mining boom. Most of our,140
NA,"tradesmen, including my sons, went to make",140
NA,significant dollars working up in your neck,140
NA,"of the woods, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER -at",140
NA,Emerald and other places up there.,140
Mr Chester, So Howard caused the,140
NA,mining boom now!,140
Mr HAYES, I am sure the member for,140
NA,"Gippsland had a very similar experience,",140
NA,actually. What the Howard government,140
NA,failed to do was invest in the training of,140
NA,young people to participate in that growth in,140
NA,jobs. Filling those vacancies that occurred in,140
NA,"Sydney, Melbourne and everywhere else was",140
NA,very much the responsibility of a,140
NA,"government that sat back, sat on its hands",140
NA,and failed to invest in training and skills,140
NA,development over the period when it had the,140
NA,opportunity to do so.,140
NA,We know that the issue of employment,140
NA,participation is more complex than just,140
NA,punishing the long-term unemployed. It is,140
NA,about skilling and reskilling people and,141
NA,"providing them with a suitable incentive, as",141
NA,"said from the start, so that they can",141
NA,go the extra mile and get the job. There is a,141
NA,certain amount of hunger associated with,141
NA,"that and, to some extent, we need to",141
NA,encourage people to have the drive to,141
NA,actually go and do that. We need to break,141
NA,"that chain, particularly in long-term",141
NA,unemployment. We cannot be a modern,141
NA,"society, a compassionate society, and tolerate",141
NA,long-term generational unemployment. That,141
NA,is not compassion; that is not something that,141
NA,you would expect from a modern society that,141
NA,cares about people and the future of the,141
NA,country.,141
NA,This is particularly the case as we address another day.,141
NA,the issue of long-term unemployment. This is,141
NA,an important amendment. It is an amendment,141
NA,that will send a message to all those seeking,141
NA,work that we as a government take their,141
NA,search for work very seriously. This,141
NA,amendment will demonstrate that the Gillard,141
NA,government's commitment to workforce,141
NA,participation to ensure the continued growth,141
NA,of the country is certainly addressed. It is,141
NA,certainly an amendment that deserves the,141
NA,support of both sides of this chamber,141
NA,because it goes not only to looking after the,141
NA,"interest of individuals, not only to looking",141
NA,after generational aspects of having a job,141
NA,what that means to your children into the,141
NA,future; it sets the example that shows you,141
NA,can achieve in this country through,141
NA,education and participation in the workforce.,141
NA,I commend this amendment bill to the,141
NA,"House and I, for one, am very keen to",141
NA,advocate in support of the amendments,141
NA,throughout my electorate because I know,141
NA,this is where we will see considerable,141
NA,benefits over the years to come as there is,141
NA,greater participation in the Australian,141
NA,workforce and the breaking of the scourge of,141
NA,long-term unemployment.,141
Mr CHESTER ,Gippsland) (17:04): I,141
NA,I rise to speak in relation to the Social Security,141
NA,actually Legislation Amendment (Job Seeker,141
NA,Compliance) Bill 2011. In doing so I will,141
NA,raise several issues of concern to my,141
NA,"community, some of which I believe have",141
NA,broader national implications. But I cannot,141
NA,resist commenting at least a little on the,141
NA,member for Fowler's contribution. He is a,141
NA,member who I find to be very thoughtful in,141
NA,"his comments, as a general rule, and I agree",141
NA,"with a lot of what he said, particularly about",141
NA,the need to keep young people engaged. I,141
NA,take great exception to his assertions that the,141
NA,Howard government did nothing in relation,141
NA,"to skills and training, but that is a debate for",141
NA,It is worth noting that the Rudd,141
NA,government actually watered down the,141
NA,"mutual obligation in 2008, introducing their",141
NA,"'no show no pay' compliance model, which",141
NA,saw job seekers docked a day's welfare for,141
NA,failing to attend interviews. It is all very well,141
NA,"to have a soft heart in this place, but there is",141
NA,no excuse for a government having a soft,141
NA,head. I am afraid it was a soft-headed,141
NA,response by the Rudd government. The high,141
NA,rate of missed appointments is a clear,141
NA,indication of the failure of Labor's,141
NA,"compliance regime, which I do not believe",141
NA,and provided sufficient disincentive for many,141
NA,"people. In March 2011 there were 179,000",141
NA,people classed as long-term unemployed in,141
NA,"Australia, and in the past 12 months leading",141
NA,up to that period approximately two million,141
NA,people missed job interviews. I think that is a,141
NA,fair reflection that there was nothing to,141
NA,ensure the compliance of those people who,141
NA,were meant to attend activities with the,141
NA,providers.,141
NA,I have spoken in the past about the need to,141
NA,"reform our welfare system, particularly as it",141
NA,relates to young people in receipt of,141
NA,unemployment benefits. I do get the chance,141
NA,to speak to many young people in my,141
NA,"community, as I am sure many other",142
NA,"members do, particularly in our secondary",142
NA,"schools, and I always encourage them to aim",142
NA,high to achieve their full potential and to,142
NA,never sell themselves short. Just because,142
NA,"they come from a regional community, there",142
NA,is no reason to sell themselves short and,142
NA,think that some things are beyond them in,142
NA,their future career prospects. I also tell them,142
NA,that they really should treat unemployment,142
NA,"as being a situation of last resort for them, in",142
NA,terms of receiving unemployment benefits.,142
NA,There is no-one that I ever speak to in,142
NA,secondary school that regards being long-,142
NA,"term unemployed as a career goal, so I think",142
NA,there is something that goes wrong from,142
NA,those mid-secondary school years to when,142
NA,the young people are actually seeking work.,142
NA,"That is where we need to make sure that, as a",142
NA,"government, we have a firm hand but a",142
NA,supporting system. That is a critical issue for,142
NA,us: to help young people in those very,142
NA,difficult transitional years as they move out,142
NA,of secondary school and into the workforce.,142
NA,I am concerned that for some young,142
NA,"people who may go off the rails, for",142
NA,"whatever reasons, the option of receiving",142
NA,unemployment benefits has become too easy.,142
NA,I support an overhaul of the unemployment,142
NA,"benefits system, with a view to making sure",142
NA,that people who can work are actually,142
NA,working. That is not intended as some sort of,142
NA,punishment to these people in any way,142
NA,whatsoever. I believe we do these young,142
NA,people a huge disservice if we allow them to,142
NA,remain on unemployment benefits without,142
NA,ensuring that there are some very stringent,142
NA,obligations on them to make a contribution,142
NA,to our community.,142
NA,Programs like Work for the Dole and,142
NA,Green Corps have been successful in many,142
NA,parts of Gippsland in providing opportunities,142
NA,for young unemployed people to develop a,142
NA,"work ethic, to develop new skills and to",142
NA,make a meaningful contribution to our,142
NA,community. They should not be seen as any,142
NA,form of punishment. I would advocate that,142
NA,we find a new name for the Work for the,142
NA,"Dole program, something that is far more",142
NA,positive and encourages people to feel that,142
NA,they are actually making a contribution to the,142
NA,community rather than it being some sort of,142
NA,punitive measure.,142
NA,"There are, however, concerns with the",142
NA,program and concerns with the compliance,142
NA,regime. I have had the opportunity to speak,142
NA,to coordinators from different agencies who,142
NA,are involved in these types of work activity,142
NA,programs and work based training programs.,142
NA,They have met with me and described the,142
NA,problems that they are having in making sure,142
NA,that long-term unemployed people are,142
NA,"meeting their obligations. In a typical case, a",142
NA,training allowance may be provided for,142
NA,someone to work in some sort of Green,142
NA,"Corps type program, and they will be given",142
NA,clothes and suitable equipment to participate,142
NA,in that program. Sometimes there is some,142
NA,financial incentive involved. The problem,142
NA,starts if they turn up on the first day but on,142
NA,subsequent days they simply do not turn up,142
NA,and participate at all in the activity they are,142
NA,meant to be participating in. The problem,142
NA,continues when the agencies submit to,142
NA,Centrelink a participation report and,142
NA,Centrelink does not actually breach the,142
NA,people involved; there are no sanctions,142
NA,applied to them.,142
NA,I can understand the situation from the,142
NA,side of the Centrelink staff faced with a,142
NA,"disgruntled client, someone who is making",142
NA,all sorts of claims as to why they could not,142
NA,reasonably attend that activity or work,142
NA,training program. It is probably easier in,142
NA,many cases for the Centrelink staff to simply,142
NA,wave it through and allow the person to not,142
NA,be breached. But it goes to the core of what,143
NA,we are talking about here today in terms of,143
NA,the compliance measures.,143
NA,There are people out there right now who,143
NA,are taking the Australian taxpayers for a ride.,143
NA,This type of rorting of the system has to stop.,143
NA,We need to set higher standards of workforce,143
NA,"participation. In that sense, I do support the",143
NA,new compliance legislation before the House,143
NA,"this evening. In her second reading speech,",143
NA,the Minister for Employment Participation,143
NA,said:,143
NA,As soon as Centrelink is advised that a job,143
NA,seeker has missed an appointment with their,143
NA,"employment services provider, or if the",143
NA,believes that the job seeker has become,143
NA,disengaged from an activity they are supposed,143
NA,"be participating in, Centrelink will suspend",143
NA,job seeker‘s payment.,143
NA,That is a positive step. I know there are a,143
NA,range of issues to do with what are,143
NA,reasonable excuses and ensuring that the,143
NA,most vulnerable people are not adversely,143
NA,impacted unnecessarily by this new approach,143
NA,"from the government, but I certainly support",143
NA,the general thrust of the new compliance,143
NA,regime.,143
NA,I would like to note a submission from,143
NA,Mission Australia to the inquiry into this,143
NA,legislation. Mission Australia supported the,143
NA,"proposed amendments, saying that they 'are",143
NA,critical to ensure the compliance regime is,143
NA,not too lenient and has a more immediate,143
NA,"effect,' the point being that, unless there is a",143
NA,direct and obvious effect on the job seeker at,143
NA,"the time of the actual breach, the impact of",143
NA,such sanctions is likely to be diminished.,143
NA,The Mission Australia submission also,143
NA,highlights the high number of participation,143
NA,reports that are being overturned by,143
NA,Centrelink. That is something I referred to,143
NA,earlier. The majority of participation reports,143
NA,are overturned on 'reasonable excuse',143
NA,grounds. Around 20 per cent of the,143
NA,reasonable excuses upheld by Centrelink,143
NA,were on the grounds of a medical reason,143
NA,where specific evidence was not provided.,143
NA,That goes again to the core of the issue: we,143
NA,really must be expecting some level of,143
NA,"credibility to the excuses being put forward,",143
NA,and these reasonable excuses must be,143
NA,legitimate if we are to ensure that people are,143
NA,meeting their obligations.,143
NA,"I would like to stress that, in the",143
NA,"comments I am making tonight, I am not",143
NA,seeking to typecast people on unemployment,143
NA,benefits simply as dole bludgers just because,143
NA,they are not in full-time employment or,143
NA,gainfully employed in the community. For,143
NA,"provider many people, it is a source of great",143
NA,"embarrassment. There is financial, social and",143
NA,to emotional difficulty associated for those who,143
NA,the are genuinely unemployed. But we do have,143
NA,to provide additional motivation for those,143
NA,people in our community who simply refuse,143
NA,to comply with their obligations. I believe,143
NA,that a new form of mutual obligation is,143
NA,necessary. I understand the government has,143
NA,made some announcements in the budget.,143
NA,"For my liking, they simply do not go far",143
NA,"enough. I believe that, if you are fit and able",143
NA,"to work, then after a period of between three",143
NA,and six months of being unemployed we,143
NA,really need to make sure that you are actually,143
NA,doing some sort of community based project,143
NA,where you will have the opportunity to make,143
NA,a meaningful contribution to the community,143
NA,in which you live.,143
NA,There is an unlimited amount of work that,143
NA,could be done in our community through a,143
NA,range of community projects like Work for,143
NA,the Dole or Green Corps. Look at any coastal,143
NA,community. There are a number of things,143
NA,"that you could be doing, such as foreshore",143
NA,"reparation works, rubbish removal,",143
NA,improving community halls and sporting,143
NA,facilities and even helping older people to,143
NA,remain in their homes longer. There are a,143
NA,whole range of tasks that are available and,143
NA,out there in the community. People could,143
NA,learn new skills and participate in these,144
NA,"tasks, even after they have only been in",144
NA,receipt of unemployment benefits for a,144
NA,comparatively short time.,144
NA,I believe that even in that short period,144
NA,"time, three to six months, there is a real",144
NA,impact on the morale of the person involved.,144
NA,They can get into poor habits in terms of,144
NA,their work ethic and end up being,144
NA,disconnected from the community in which,144
NA,they live. So I do not think we are doing,144
NA,anyone any favours by just handing out,144
NA,unemployment benefits without some,144
NA,reasonable expectation that the recipients,144
NA,will then make a contribution to the society,144
NA,that has provided them.,144
NA,There are also sections of my community,144
NA,where we are now faced with the entrenched,144
NA,welfare dependency problem of second and,144
NA,third generation welfare recipients. If you,144
NA,have never seen someone get out of bed and,144
NA,"go to work, if you have never experienced",144
NA,the discipline of providing for your own,144
NA,"family, if you have never felt the pride and",144
NA,growth in self-esteem which comes from,144
NA,making a contribution to the community and,144
NA,if you have never seen anyone in your,144
NA,"immediate family doing that either, it is very",144
NA,difficult for you to break out of the welfare,144
NA,cycle. I believe that we need to do more in,144
NA,this place-and in that regard I welcome this,144
NA,new compliance regime-to encourage that,144
NA,"work ethic, particularly amongst the families",144
NA,in my community which have had such a,144
NA,reliance on welfare over a long period of,144
NA,time.,144
NA,Passive welfare really does destroy lives,144
NA,and I do not think we need to look any,144
NA,further than the Indigenous community in,144
NA,Gippsland. Too many people in that,144
NA,community have been receiving benefits for,144
NA,many years without any expectation,144
NA,whatsoever of doing some work in return. I,144
NA,think we really need to understand that the,144
NA,issues facing Aboriginal families in Australia,144
NA,do not reside purely in the Northern Territory,144
NA,or other remote areas. The passive welfare,144
NA,of system that has developed over many,144
NA,"years-most of it well-intentioned, but",144
NA,unfortunately poorly directed-has destroyed,144
NA,families in my community. Gippsland right,144
NA,now has many young people growing up in,144
NA,quite hopeless environments. I believe that,144
NA,paid employment is the way out of poverty,144
NA,for these people and that the decency of a job,144
NA,leads to a wide range of very positive,144
NA,outcomes.,144
NA,The issues I am talking about that are,144
NA,facing the Indigenous people in my,144
NA,"community are centred around health,",144
NA,education and jobs. It is a vicious circle if,144
NA,any one of these boxes is not ticked. We,144
NA,"need to ensure that, at a very early age, our",144
NA,Aboriginal children are being well looked,144
NA,after. Healthy kids who are well looked after,144
NA,"at home go on to do well at school, they go",144
NA,on to enjoy their education and they go on to,144
NA,lead successful lives. It is easy to say that; it,144
NA,is very hard to provide that in every local,144
NA,community.,144
NA,"On the flip side, there are children who",144
NA,"witness violence or abuse, who are neglected",144
NA,in some way or who are not properly,144
NA,checked by doctors or nurses at an early age,144
NA,and develop health problems. These children,144
NA,are starting behind the eight ball when it,144
NA,"comes to the education sector, so naturally",144
NA,they do not get the opportunity to develop,144
NA,the skills required for them to go on into the,144
NA,workforce.,144
NA,It is an enormous challenge for us to break,144
NA,that cycle of welfare dependency in our,144
NA,Aboriginal community and we need to keep,144
NA,working very hard with the service providers,144
NA,to make sure that we have individual families,144
NA,taking responsibility and helping these,144
NA,children achieve their full potential. We can,145
NA,run all the programs we want-and,145
NA,governments from both sides of politics have,145
NA,"tried many programs-but, at the grassroots",145
NA,"level, the people themselves have to want to",145
NA,make some changes.,145
NA,There is some terrific work being done in,145
NA,"my community, particularly in Morwell,",145
NA,"Sale, Bairnsdale, Lake Tyers and Lakes",145
NA,"Entrance, where there are elders in the",145
NA,community who are doing a power of work.,145
NA,But in many cases I fear they are swimming,145
NA,against the tide. I have had the opportunity,145
NA,recent times to participate in an activity at,145
NA,"Lake Tyers Mission, where there has been a",145
NA,fishing competition. It was designed to get,145
NA,young kids together with their families to,145
NA,"participate in a good, friendly, healthy",145
NA,outdoor activity without any alcohol and,145
NA,without any pressure whatsoever being,145
NA,placed on the community. It was a great,145
NA,event and it helped to bring everyone,145
NA,together to start thinking about what we can,145
NA,do to provide a more functional community,145
NA,throughout Gippsland. Many of the primary,145
NA,schools and sporting clubs in my electorate,145
NA,are working overtime to engage with the,145
NA,local Aboriginal community as much as,145
NA,possible. We need to break down those,145
NA,"barriers, to provide opportunities and to",145
NA,make sure the Aboriginal community is,145
NA,involved in everything that we do in,145
NA,Gippsland.,145
NA,"The government, to its credit, has funded",145
NA,a major new childcare and kindergarten,145
NA,"facility in Bairnsdale which should assist, I",145
NA,"believe, in getting young children ready for",145
NA,school-to help send them on their way and,145
NA,make the most positive step possible. At the,145
NA,moment we have too many young Aboriginal,145
NA,kids who are starting their prep school,145
NA,already behind. They are already a year or,145
NA,two behind their counterparts in the,145
NA,classroom. Unfortunately they,145
NA,disenchanted and too many of them drop out,145
NA,of the school system as young as 10 or 12,145
NA,"years old. As I said, we are making some",145
NA,improvements and many people are,145
NA,committed to the cause.,145
NA,I accept that there are no easy answers. If,145
NA,"there were easy answers, these situations",145
NA,would have been fixed many years ago. But I,145
NA,want to bring these issues to the attention of,145
NA,the House and to make the point that the,145
NA,urban or regional Indigenous experience in,145
NA,"Australia is, in many ways, as perilous as",145
NA,that of the more remote communities that we,145
NA,in hear so much about and which attract a lot of,145
NA,the media attention. I think we need to do a,145
NA,lot better to make sure that our Aboriginal,145
NA,communities are engaged in community life.,145
NA,"In particular, I believe there is an opportunity",145
NA,for us to work much more closely with our,145
NA,sporting clubs. People from those,145
NA,communities often excel at sporting activities,145
NA,and that provides a bridge for them to get,145
NA,more involved in mainstream activities. I,145
NA,believe very strongly in local solutions to,145
NA,local problems. I think the opportunities are,145
NA,there for us to work in this place for the,145
NA,"betterment of all people in our community,",145
NA,particularly those Aboriginal members of our,145
NA,community who are falling so far behind in,145
NA,Gippsland at the moment.,145
NA,Mr CRAIG THOMSON (Dobell),145
NA,(17:20): It is a pleasure to follow the,145
NA,"member for Gippsland, who has made a very",145
NA,thoughtful contribution today. He has,145
NA,obviously thought long and hard about the,145
NA,effects of unemployment in his community.,145
NA,It is not often that I get up following the,145
NA,member for Gippsland and say that I agree,145
NA,with most of the sentiments he has,145
NA,"expressed, but I do today. He has outlined",145
NA,well the issues about the importance of,145
NA,"personal responsibility in looking for jobs,",145
NA,but he has also emphasised the need for,145
NA,opportunities for people to get the proper,145
NA,get education and have access to jobs-,145
NA,particularly in relation to Indigenous,145
NA,Australians. The important issues of,146
NA,Aboriginal health and life expectancy need,146
NA,to be looked after.,146
NA,The approach on employment that the,146
NA,member for Gippsland has outlined is the,146
NA,approach the Australian Labor Party has,146
NA,adopted. I look forward to the member for,146
NA,Gippsland actually supporting the budget,146
NA,"that the Treasurer brought down last night,",146
NA,because if ever there were a budget focused,146
NA,"on jobs, health and education, it was the one",146
NA,last night. That is clearly the flip side to,146
NA,implementing welfare system measures,146
NA,relating to obligations and personal,146
NA,"responsibility, which this bill is about. So I",146
NA,am looking forward to seeing the member for,146
NA,Gippsland coming across to this side and,146
NA,supporting the budget in a wholehearted,146
NA,"way, because I know he is very genuine",146
NA,person who expresses his views in this place,146
NA,"in a very forthright manner, as he has today.",146
NA,Clearly he is supporting the Swan budget of,146
NA,last night.,146
NA,The Social Security Legislation,146
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,146
NA,"2011, which I am speaking in support of",146
NA,"today, will allow for immediate suspension",146
NA,of a job seeker's income support payment if,146
NA,the job seeker fails to attend an appointment,146
NA,with their employment service provider or,146
NA,attend an activity under,146
NA,circumstances and allows the penalty amount,146
NA,for a reconnection failure-applied when a,146
NA,job seeker fails to attend are a scheduled,146
NA,appointment-to be deducted from the job,146
NA,seeker's next payment. It tightens the,146
NA,reasonable excuse provisions to require job,146
NA,seekers to give prior notice if they are unable,146
NA,to attend an appointment or activity on a,146
NA,particular day. Both the current compliance,146
NA,framework and the new arrangements take,146
NA,into account the individual circumstances of,146
NA,job seekers in rural and regional areas-,146
NA,which both the member for Gippsland and I,146
NA,are-and of course this is very important.,146
NA,Allowances are made for transport or,146
NA,communication difficulties which may,146
NA,impact on job seeker's ability to meet their,146
NA,participation requirements or where it may,146
NA,not be possible to arrange a new appointment,146
NA,with an employment service provider in the,146
NA,next two business days.,146
NA,The bill will introduce suspension of,146
NA,payment for job seekers following an initial,146
NA,"failure to attend an appointment or, in some",146
NA,"circumstances, an activity such as training. If",146
NA,the job seeker then agrees to re-engage as,146
NA,"required, payment will be restored with full",146
NA,back-payment. It is a measure which has the,146
NA,stick there but does not have the punitive,146
NA,nature of penalising the job seeker in the,146
NA,long term. Its aim is to have them,146
NA,reconnected with the system so that they can,146
NA,get the assistance they need. If the job seeker,146
NA,"then fails to re-engage, payment will again",146
NA,be suspended pending agreement to re-,146
NA,"engage, but if they do not have a reasonable",146
NA,excuse they will lose payment for each day,146
NA,from their second missed appointment until,146
NA,they do attend a rescheduled appointment.,146
NA,This penalty will be deducted from their very,146
NA,"next payment, rather than from their second",146
NA,next payment as is required under the current,146
NA,certain legislation.,146
NA,Reasonable excuse provisions will also be,146
NA,"tightened so that, even if a job seeker has a",146
NA,reasonable excuse for not attending an,146
NA,"appointment or activity on the day, it will not",146
NA,be accepted if they could have given advance,146
NA,notice of their inability to attend but failed to,146
NA,do so. This is important in relation to the,146
NA,type of behaviour one would expect if a job,146
NA,seeker were in employment. We should not,146
NA,be setting lower standards for a job seeker,146
NA,than we would expect from an employee.,146
NA,This starts to match up those obligations.,146
NA,Job seekers with vulnerability indicators,147
NA,on their Centrelink record-such as those,147
NA,who are homeless or who have a mental,147
NA,illness-will not have their payment,147
NA,immediately suspended following the first,147
NA,"non-attendance, although they will continue",147
NA,to be subject to the other arrangements I,147
NA,have already outlined.,147
NA,This bill delivers on the government's,147
NA,election commitment to introduce tighter,147
NA,rules for job seekers. Available data supports,147
NA,the need for some tightening of the system.,147
NA,After some improvement immediately,147
NA,following the introduction of the current,147
NA,"compliance framework in July 2009,",147
NA,attendance rates at provider appointments,147
NA,fell during 2009-10.,147
NA,Suspension of payment provides a strong,147
NA,immediate incentive for job seekers who,147
NA,miss appointments to re-engage quickly.,147
NA,When a job seeker's payment is suspended,147
NA,"following a missed appointment, they get all",147
NA,their money back once they do what is,147
NA,required of them. This is an effective way of,147
NA,encouraging compliance without taking the,147
NA,punitive approach of immediately applying a,147
NA,penalty that the job seeker cannot get back.,147
NA,The Disney report into job seeker,147
NA,"compliance, released in September 2010,",147
NA,recommended that the government consider,147
NA,introducing payment suspensions if the,147
NA,attendance rate at provider appointments did,147
NA,not significantly improve within 12 months,147
NA,or so. Although the tougher rules measure,147
NA,was announced before the report was,147
NA,"released, recent appointment attendance data",147
NA,suggests that this pre-emptive approach is,147
NA,justified.,147
NA,Just today the House Standing Committee,147
NA,on Education and Employment tabled its,147
NA,advisory report on this bill. The committee's,147
NA,"chair, the member for Kingston, has said in",147
NA,the report that the importance of fostering,147
NA,and enhancing employment participation,147
NA,cannot be overstated. The member for,147
NA,Kingston also said:,147
NA,The benefits of employment stretch far beyond,147
NA,the receipt of a pay packet. Employment,147
NA,"participation brings not only economic security,",147
NA,"but also dignity, purpose, and direction. A central",147
NA,element of fostering employment participation is,147
NA,encouraging job seekers to communicate and,147
NA,interact with employment service providers,147
NA,through attendance at appointments. The bill,147
NA,seeks to encourage job seekers to do this.,147
NA,"Specifically, the committee recommended",147
NA,that a plain English redrafting of the changes,147
NA,proposed by the bill be produced to combat,147
NA,the existing complexity of the social security,147
NA,system and ensure that job seekers fully,147
NA,understand their obligations under the,147
NA,proposed changes.,147
NA,The committee also recommended that the,147
NA,word 'special' be removed from the proposed,147
NA,reasonable excuse provision in the bill in,147
NA,order to eliminate an unnecessary layer of,147
NA,complexity and ensure equitable and clear,147
NA,implementation of the measures proposed by,147
NA,the bill. Other areas of interest highlighted,147
NA,by the committee include the development of,147
NA,consistent guidance and training material for,147
NA,front-line staff; the provision of,147
NA,comprehensive training to front-line staff;,147
NA,the collection of data on why job seekers,147
NA,miss appointments without a reasonable,147
NA,excuse and the undertaking of a review of,147
NA,the impact of the measures proposed by the,147
NA,bill; the provision of additional training and,147
NA,guidance to front-line staff in relation to,147
NA,"vulnerable job seekers; and, the monitoring",147
NA,of possible increased workloads for front-,147
NA,line staff.,147
NA,The amendments in this bill will enhance,147
NA,the current job seeker compliance framework,147
NA,by providing additional incentives for job,147
NA,seekers to engage with their employment,147
NA,services providers and to participate fully in,147
NA,activities designed to improve their,147
NA,employment prospects. Immediate,147
NA,"suspension of payment, either with full back",148
NA,payment on compliance or with resumption,148
NA,"of payment upon compliance, is consistent",148
NA,with the government's broad approach to job,148
NA,"seeker compliance, which focuses on early",148
NA,intervention and the use of immediate,148
NA,corrective action to keep job seekers on the,148
NA,right path. The amendments should simplify,148
NA,the system for job seekers in that the,148
NA,consequences of not attending appointments,148
NA,and activities will be clearer and more,148
NA,immediate. These amendments are not,148
NA,intended to increase penalty numbers per se.,148
NA,The principle that no job seeker should,148
NA,actually lose payment without warning or a,148
NA,second chance to comply will remain in,148
NA,place.,148
NA,Employment services providers will still,148
NA,have the discretion not to initiate compliance,148
NA,action in most circumstances and will still,148
NA,able to use the contact request arrangements,148
NA,when they want Centrelink to contact a job,148
NA,seeker for them without taking compliance,148
NA,action.,148
NA,I was very pleased to hear in last night's,148
NA,budget that the Wyong local government,148
NA,area which takes up most of my electorate on,148
NA,the New South Wales Central Coast has been,148
NA,chosen for extra help in getting young,148
NA,parents and families skilled up and educated,148
NA,so they can enter the workforce. This is the,148
NA,other side of getting people into jobs which,148
NA,the member for Gippsland highlighted in,148
NA,relation to saying that there needs to be,148
NA,opportunities for jobs and there needs to be,148
NA,education. The Wyong local government,148
NA,area has been chosen from just 10 areas,148
NA,around Australia to receive a $304 million,148
NA,boost in the budget for this help. The,148
NA,comprehensive package recognises the skills,148
NA,and employment disadvantages of the area,148
NA,and has been specifically designed to help,148
NA,boost job rate numbers in Wyong shire.,148
NA,"Again, I go back to the contribution of the",148
NA,member for Gippsland when he said that the,148
NA,best solutions in relation to jobs are local.,148
NA,The announcement last night in the budget in,148
NA,relation to these 10 areas-the 10 worst-hit,148
NA,areas in relation to employment-was that,148
NA,local solutions were going to be developed,148
NA,with this money. We are looking forward to,148
NA,these local solutions in the Wyong shire. I,148
NA,"am sure, as I mentioned earlier, that when",148
NA,the appropriation documents and all the,148
NA,measures of the budget come into this House,148
NA,we will welcome the member for Gippsland,148
NA,over to this side to vote in support of those,148
NA,"documents, given the statements that he",148
NA,made in his contribution to this debate.,148
NA,The comprehensive package that was,148
NA,announced last night recognises the skills,148
NA,and employment disadvantage of the area,148
NA,be that I represent and it is designed to boost,148
NA,jobs in that area. This is great news for my,148
NA,"area, which has long been disadvantaged",148
NA,with low education and skill levels and has,148
NA,previously missed out on the sort of help,148
NA,needed to get us on par with many other,148
NA,regions in Australia in relation to,148
NA,employment.,148
NA,We know that many teenage parents leave,148
NA,school early without year 12 qualifications,148
NA,"and end up as long-term welfare recipients,",148
NA,"with negative consequences for them, their",148
NA,children and their families. The new package,148
NA,announced in the budget will help teenage,148
NA,parents in Wyong get a better job so that they,148
NA,can provide for their children as they grow,148
NA,"older. From 1 January 2012, teenage parents",148
NA,in the Wyong LGA who have not finished,148
NA,year 12 or equivalent and are receiving the,148
NA,government's parenting payment will need to,148
NA,meet an individually crafted participation,148
NA,plan.,148
NA,But this is not just about toughening up,148
NA,the rules for job seekers; they will also be,148
NA,given support to help them meet their extra,149
NA,"responsibilities and milestones. In Wyong,",149
NA,support for teenage parents will include,149
NA,access to quality child care while they are,149
NA,"studying or training, with close to 100 per",149
NA,cent of their childcare costs covered. They,149
NA,will also receive support from Youth,149
NA,Connections services to help them enrol in,149
NA,"and attend school, TAFE or other training.",149
NA,And teens will also be supported with their,149
NA,parenting responsibilities through play,149
NA,"groups, parenting education classes, early",149
NA,learning programs and mentoring.,149
NA,This package supports young parents to,149
NA,"engage their children in early education, and",149
NA,development opportunities to gain skills and,149
NA,education for themselves. It enables teenage,149
NA,parents to position themselves to enter the,149
NA,labour market once their youngest child is,149
NA,"aged six, when participation requirements",149
NA,mean they need to commence at least part-,149
NA,time work. The measures support families,149
NA,who are at risk of disadvantage by ensuring,149
NA,they will have access to the services they,149
NA,need to fulfil their goals. The measures,149
NA,achieve this in a way that recognises the,149
NA,autonomy of parents and their responsibility,149
NA,to provide for their children. The $304,149
NA,million package provides for several,149
NA,initiatives across the 10 places and of,149
NA,includes the Wyong LGA.,149
NA,The budget last night and this legislation,149
NA,here today are both part of a government,149
NA,strategy that looks at making sure that,149
NA,individuals take responsibility for their own,149
NA,actions in terms of participating. The,149
NA,changes to this bill that we are talking,149
NA,today but also the measures that were,149
NA,announced in the budget last night look at,149
NA,making sure they have the absolutely,149
NA,"essential opportunities, support, mentoring",149
NA,and ability to gain skills that mean they will,149
NA,be able to go into gainful employment. This,149
NA,bill also places an emphasis on responsibility,149
NA,for attendance.,149
NA,Getting Australians into the workforce is a,149
NA,matter of personal dignity for those who are,149
NA,out of work at the moment. It is an,149
NA,opportunity for them and their families to be,149
NA,provided for and an opportunity for this,149
NA,country. With 4.9 per cent unemployment at,149
NA,"the moment and a tightening labour market,",149
NA,we need increased participation rates. So,149
NA,everyone wins in making sure we get people,149
NA,out of the dole queues and into employment.,149
NA,That is why the measures that this,149
NA,government has introduced both in this bill,149
NA,"and also, most importantly, through the",149
NA,budget last night are ones that anyone in this,149
NA,place who is interested in getting people,149
NA,back into employment should be supporting.,149
NA,So I look forward to the support of both sides,149
NA,"for this bill but, as importantly, I look",149
NA,forward to the support of everyone in this,149
NA,parliament for the measures announced last,149
NA,night by the Treasurer to make sure that we,149
NA,help Australians get back into the workforce,149
NA,and get jobs in which they can truly,149
NA,participate in this economy. I commend this,149
NA,bill to the House.,149
Mr RAMSEY ,Grey) (17:35): I rise in,149
NA,support of the Social Security Legislation,149
NA,Amendment (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill,149
NA,2011. The greatest piece of welfare any,149
NA,course government or any person can give to,149
NA,"another is in fact a job. It is a plain truth,",149
NA,because we know that with a job comes a,149
NA,"whole raft of other things like self-respect,",149
NA,better education for your children and more,149
NA,likely better health outcomes. A job is the,149
NA,most important thing to improve the standard,149
NA,"about of living of any Australian or, indeed,",149
NA,anyone in the world.,149
NA,I am privileged to be the Deputy Chair of,149
NA,the House Standing Committee on Education,149
NA,and Employment. We were responsible for,149
NA,the review that was done on this legislation,149
NA,and the recommendations that came back to,149
NA,the House. We thought it was reasonably cut,149
NA,and dried in that we had flagged on this side,149
NA,of the House that we were in general in,150
NA,support of the government's legislation. But,150
NA,in the end the review process was quite,150
NA,beneficial to the legislation in general and,150
NA,certainly in drawing up the guidelines of the,150
NA,legislation. I believe there may even be a,150
NA,small amendment moved at the completion,150
NA,of this debate to one of the terms. But in,150
NA,particular it gave an opportunity for the,150
NA,industry to air some of their concerns and,150
NA,ongoing issues with the way the job seeker,150
NA,"arrangements are dealt with, and it gave us",150
NA,an opportunity to express the view that the,150
NA,language should be very clear and that,150
NA,people should understand what is going on,150
NA,here. One of the recommendations was that,150
NA,things should be in plain English because,150
NA,often the people dealing with it at this end of,150
NA,the field are not well educated and they need,150
NA,to easily understand what is going on.,150
NA,Another interesting thing for the,150
NA,committee was the quite wide support,150
NA,"through the industry, if not the welfare lobby",150
NA,"organisations, for this move to tighten up",150
NA,these obligations. We recommended there be,150
NA,a comprehensive training package and the,150
NA,department be required to collect data on the,150
NA,reasons why people are no-shows for,150
NA,interviews and appointments so that we can,150
NA,better understand what it is that drives them,150
NA,and perhaps find better ways to get them to,150
NA,"participate. In the end, you cannot give",150
NA,people a job if they are not prepared to,150
NA,participate or are not interested in,150
NA,participating in the process.,150
NA,One of the other recommendations was,150
NA,"after a full year of operation, the data be",150
NA,analysed and the department have another,150
NA,look at how the regime is operating. There,150
NA,was also a recommendation concerning,150
NA,vulnerable job seekers. Initially I was a,150
NA,concerned about this insofar as it sounded,150
NA,"like a watering down of the process, but",150
NA,when we consider what a vulnerable job,150
NA,seeker is this recommendation has merit.,150
NA,They may not have a home or may have a,150
NA,"mental disability, so I think the",150
NA,recommendation is well founded. We must,150
NA,be very careful not to alienate those who are,150
NA,unable to help themselves in this process. It,150
NA,is very much pointed at getting those who,150
NA,are able to help themselves and better,150
NA,themselves involved in the process and,150
NA,making sure they make the most of their,150
NA,opportunities.,150
NA,There are some confusing messages here.,150
NA,While we support the government's,150
NA,"legislation, there have been quite a few times",150
NA,when this government has sent mixed,150
NA,messages to the electorate and to the people,150
NA,at large. I remind the House that the Rudd,150
NA,government watered down the terms of,150
NA,"mutual obligation in 2008, and how the",150
NA,government must sometimes wish that they,150
NA,had left well enough alone with some,150
NA,legislation. If we turn our minds to the,150
NA,current interceptions of people trying to,150
NA,"come to Australia in boats, perhaps the",150
NA,government may reflect that some of the,150
NA,settings that were on the clock when they,150
NA,took over the job 3½ years ago were in fact,150
NA,good models. They may well look back on,150
NA,mutual obligation in the same way.,150
NA,"In a very closely related field, I am",150
NA,reminded that the government also relaxed,150
NA,the regime surrounding the Work for the,150
NA,"Dole program at about the same time, in",150
NA,"2008. Previously, if someone had been on",150
NA,the dole for six months they may have been,150
NA,required to attend a Work for the Dole,150
NA,program. That was changed to 12 months.,150
NA,That may not seem all that much of a,150
NA,"change, on the face of it, but I have talked to",150
NA,little a number of people who have coordinated,150
NA,"Work for the Dole groups, and the program",150
NA,has been gutted as a result of that change.,150
NA,"Because there was that six-month break, they",151
NA,ran out of customers. The work crews were,151
NA,abandoned and those who were running the,151
NA,work crews moved off to find new,151
NA,employment. It is just not that easy to line,151
NA,some of these things up again in a hurry. The,151
NA,Labor Party has long been uncomfortable,151
NA,"with Work for the Dole provisions, but it has",151
NA,been a very popular program-and not only,151
NA,popular; it has been instrumental in engaging,151
NA,those people who were choosing to be,151
NA,unengaged in the process. While that does,151
NA,not strictly relate to this part of the,151
NA,"legislation, it is certainly a related issue",151
NA,because we are talking once again about,151
NA,trying to get people engaged in a process.,151
NA,We can put this in the context of a bucket,151
NA,of measures where the government have,151
NA,shown inconsistency. I will not go into any,151
NA,"detail on any of them, but I simply list",151
NA,I mentioned the asylum seekers. The,151
NA,government were going to adopt the save the,151
NA,"Murray report, but of course then they did",151
NA,"not adopt it. They were to have a CPRS, but",151
NA,then they were not to have a CPRS. They,151
NA,"were never to have a carbon tax, and now",151
NA,they are to have a carbon tax. They were,151
NA,"going to have a green car, but of course now",151
NA,we are not going to have a green car. We,151
NA,were going to have cash for clunkers and,151
NA,now we are not. In my electorate we were to,151
NA,have an MRI machine and now we are not.,151
NA,The government were going to introduce a,151
NA,"dental scheme, and now we find in",151
NA,yesterday's budget that it has been deferred.,151
NA,We were definitely going to have a mining,151
NA,tax and now we definitely may be going to,151
NA,"have a mining tax, if the government can",151
NA,ever work out the detail. And we were,151
NA,"always to have surplus budgets, but of course",151
NA,"we have not seen one of those yet, either.",151
NA,I just bring these inconsistencies to this,151
NA,part of the debate. This is why people in the,151
NA,"electorate, the Australian public, are",151
NA,becoming confused with the message. I am,151
NA,very happy that the government has seen the,151
NA,light on the issue of re-engaging those who,151
NA,may not wish in the first instance to seek a,151
NA,"job, to get them back on board. That is why I",151
NA,"am happy to support the legislation, but the",151
NA,government should take great care before it,151
NA,mucks around with things that are working,151
NA,okay.,151
NA,Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (17:43): It is my,151
NA,pleasure to speak in support of the Social,151
NA,Security Legislation Amendment (Job,151
NA,Seeker Compliance) Bill 2011. This is,151
NA,certainly an important bill and it fits in very,151
NA,well with the budget announcements made,151
NA,by the Treasurer last night. It is important,151
NA,because it seeks to enhance the current job,151
NA,seeker compliance framework. The bill has,151
NA,come about as part of the Modernising,151
NA,Australia's Welfare System program that the,151
NA,them. government announced on 11 August 2010.,151
NA,The government made a commitment at that,151
NA,time to introduce tougher rules for job,151
NA,"seekers from 1 July 2011. Well, here we are,",151
NA,once again fulfilling a commitment that we,151
NA,have made to ensure that we do introduce,151
NA,tougher rules for job seekers and to deliver,151
NA,those rules from the 1 July 2011,151
NA,commencement date.,151
NA,We have heard a fair bit from those on the,151
NA,"other side, including the member for Grey,",151
NA,about changes that the government made,151
NA,back in 2008 in relation to re-engaging,151
NA,workers. That those on the other side have,151
NA,failed to mention on each and every occasion,151
NA,that they have spoken on this bill and on the,151
NA,changes made in 2008-and we know they,151
NA,do not like to talk about this issue-is the,151
NA,fact that there was a global financial crisis,151
NA,"occurring at that time. Consequently,",151
NA,because of the risks of job losses occurring at,151
NA,"that time, there were changes made in",151
NA,relation to programs dealing with the,151
NA,unemployed to provide greater flexibility,151
NA,during those very difficult times for our,151
NA,"economy. We are fortunate now, in 2011, to",151
NA,be in a position where unemployment is,152
NA,down to 4.9 per cent. We have a skills,152
NA,shortage and we have people in our society,152
NA,"right now, in our local communities, who can",152
NA,re-engage with the workforce. Our job now,152
NA,as a government is to look at how we can set,152
NA,in place a framework that provides,152
NA,incentives to get those people to re-engage.,152
NA,That is what this bill seeks to do.,152
NA,"Yes, it does put in place punitive measures",152
NA,if people seek to ignore their responsibilities,152
NA,in relation to trying to re-engage where they,152
NA,are capable of doing so. This bill aims to get,152
NA,job seekers to participate fully in activities,152
NA,designed to improve employment prospects.,152
NA,The mechanism that it seeks to use is to say,152
NA,that when a person does not attend an,152
NA,interview or an appointment then they will,152
NA,have their entitlements suspended. That only,152
NA,occurs if the individual does not notify that,152
NA,they cannot make the appointment. So it is,152
NA,not a case of simply being unavailable to,152
NA,attend an appointment; it is only in,152
NA,circumstances where they fail to give any,152
NA,reasonable excuse for not attending or fail to,152
NA,make any contact. There is a safety,152
NA,"mechanism there that, if they reschedule and",152
NA,"they attend that next appointment, they will",152
NA,"get the money reimbursed. However, if they",152
NA,"reschedule and once again fail to attend,",152
NA,there can be a suspension of their payments,152
NA,and a reconnection failure.,152
NA,So there is a punitive mechanism to say,152
NA,that you will have to sacrifice some of your,152
NA,entitlements if you do not seek to re-engage,152
NA,and you are capable of re-engaging. The,152
NA,government have said that we recognise the,152
NA,benefits and the dignity that come with work.,152
NA,We want to ensure that those who are,152
NA,currently not engaged in the workforce make,152
NA,all reasonable efforts to re-engage and that,152
NA,they understand the responsibility that comes,152
NA,with making appointments and attending,152
NA,those appointments whenever possible. Like,152
NA,"any worker with a job, if you are unable to",152
NA,attend then you must make contact. If you,152
NA,have a job and you cannot go to work that,152
NA,"day, it is unacceptable to just not turn up.",152
NA,You must make contact. Those who are not,152
NA,in the workforce must recognise that they,152
NA,have an equal responsibility if they cannot,152
NA,"make an appointment. It is important,",152
NA,"however, that we point out that there is still",152
NA,discretion with the employment service,152
NA,providers in relation to whether they issue a,152
NA,participation report. It is important that they,152
NA,use their discretion in relation to vulnerable,152
NA,job seekers and that they use every,152
NA,opportunity and mechanism to help re-,152
NA,engage those workers in the workforce. We,152
NA,must ensure that those vulnerable job seekers,152
NA,are considered in relation to this bill.,152
NA,I will also make mention of the House of,152
NA,Representatives Standing Committee on,152
NA,"Education and Employment, of which the",152
NA,member for Grey is the deputy chair and the,152
NA,member for Kingston is the chair. I am also a,152
NA,member of that House standing committee.,152
NA,Some very important evidence came from,152
NA,the inquiry into this bill. The evidence that,152
NA,was gathered and the comments of the,152
NA,"committee have been detailed in our report,",152
NA,which was tabled this morning in this House.,152
NA,But what is important to note in the report of,152
NA,the committee are some of the mechanisms,152
NA,that the committee has recommended,152
NA,underpin this bill. They relate to ensuring,152
NA,consistency in guidelines across Centrelink,152
NA,"and the employment service providers, and",152
NA,training on the system to ensure that it is,152
NA,implemented correctly and fairly.,152
NA,It is important that we make sure that,152
NA,there is support for Centrelink staff in,152
NA,relation to workloads arising from this,152
NA,mechanism. We should also make sure that,152
NA,there is proper guidance for the Centrelink,152
NA,staff on how to implement this legislation.,153
NA,"Those comments, of course, should apply in",153
NA,regard to all programs that employment,153
NA,service providers and Centrelink implement.,153
NA,We should ensure there is consistent,153
NA,guidance. We should ensure that there is,153
NA,comprehensive training provided so that the,153
NA,legislation is implemented in the way it was,153
NA,"intended, that it is being implemented fairly",153
NA,and that discretion is being used in an,153
NA,appropriate way.,153
NA,We note in relation to that discretion that,153
NA,we should be making sure that Centrelink,153
NA,staff and employment service providers are,153
NA,adequately trained and aware of the,153
NA,possibility that job seekers have undisclosed,153
NA,vulnerabilities. This is a very difficult area.,153
NA,A job seeker may not necessarily identify,153
NA,"that they are vulnerable, whether because of",153
NA,"a health condition, family circumstances or",153
NA,other circumstances. We need to better train,153
NA,our Centrelink staff to raise their awareness,153
NA,"of those undisclosed vulnerabilities, to train",153
NA,them to assist those people and to manage,153
NA,the situation and those people's needs,153
NA,appropriately.,153
NA,There are two other recommendations I,153
NA,"want to make mention of. Firstly, the",153
NA,committee recommended that,153
NA,"Department of Education, Employment and",153
NA,Workplace Relations and the Department of,153
NA,Human Services collect and publish data in,153
NA,relation to why job seekers without,153
NA,reasonable excuses miss appointments. It is,153
NA,accurate-and those members who have,153
NA,spoken who have read this report or who are,153
NA,committee members have already drawn this,153
NA,House's attention to the fact-that there is,153
NA,very little data that is collected and published,153
NA,and in some areas there is basically no data,153
NA,on reasons for missed appointments. This,153
NA,data is important for us to ensure that the,153
NA,programs we put in place are adequate. To,153
NA,get the outcomes that we seek we need to be,153
NA,able to collect and publish that data and be,153
NA,tracking that data and looking at the,153
NA,outcomes.,153
NA,"The other recommendation, which is",153
NA,"recommendation 1 in the report, is that a",153
NA,"brief, plain English explanation of the",153
NA,proposed changes and the obligations that,153
NA,will stem from them be produced and made,153
NA,available to all job seekers as soon as,153
NA,"practicable. You might say, 'Well, it's just",153
NA,obvious that we would do that.' But the,153
NA,"reality is that we need to make sure, if we are",153
NA,going to have these changes come about,153
NA,"from 1 July this year, that job seekers who",153
NA,are going to be bound by these new job,153
NA,seeker compliance laws are very clear as to,153
NA,what they mean and what the obligations are,153
NA,on the individual job seeker so that they can,153
NA,ensure that they are complying with these,153
NA,requirements.,153
NA,"I have talked generally about the bill, what",153
NA,it seeks to achieve and the recommendations,153
NA,"of the committee. Before I finish may I say,",153
NA,"and I have mentioned briefly already, that I",153
NA,believe this amendment to the social security,153
NA,legislation dealing with job seeker,153
NA,compliance goes hand in hand with the,153
NA,commitments that the Labor federal,153
NA,government made in the budget last night in,153
NA,"the relation to jobs, employment, re-engaging",153
NA,"workers, skills and incentives to",153
NA,employment. Looking at the incentives to,153
NA,employment that were announced in the,153
NA,"budget, we are providing incentives to",153
NA,provide training and work experience for,153
NA,those very long term unemployed. I know,153
NA,"that there are over 1,300 long-term",153
NA,unemployed people in the electorate of,153
NA,Petrie-people who have been without work,153
NA,for two years or more. The funding that was,153
NA,announced in the budget by the federal,153
NA,government last night will assist those,153
NA,people to get local employment services,153
NA,support through training and work,153
NA,experience and by providing a wage subsidy,153
NA,to encourage employers to engage those,153
NA,long-term unemployed people. That works,154
NA,hand in hand with the job seeker compliance,154
NA,and trying to get the unemployed re-,154
NA,engaging with the workforce.,154
NA,"Of course, that was not the only",154
NA,announcement in relation to supporting jobs,154
NA,and trying to increase skills in our,154
NA,workforce. We announced improved,154
NA,incentives in the tax system and we,154
NA,announced restructuring of income support,154
NA,for single parents to promote and support,154
NA,"participation by providing, from 1 January",154
NA,"2013, single parents on Newstart allowance",154
NA,"with up to an extra $3,900 per year through a",154
NA,"more generous income test, at the same time",154
NA,that grandfathering will be phased out for,154
NA,parenting payment recipients when their,154
NA,child turns 12 to more closely align,154
NA,"eligibility with other recipients. Importantly,",154
NA,the government will also provide up to $103,154
NA,million to support single parents through,154
NA,"training, career advice and other services.",154
NA,This is another way of re-engaging people,154
NA,with the workforce.,154
NA,We are implementing new initiatives to,154
NA,introduce participation requirements for,154
NA,people with disabilities. I know there are,154
NA,people with disabilities in my electorate who,154
NA,want to re-engage in the workforce. We need,154
NA,to provide them with the assistance to do so.,154
NA,We need to provide support and,154
NA,encouragement to employers to hire those,154
NA,people. We have new programs. We are,154
NA,extending the government's 'earn or learn',154
NA,requirements to those aged 21. This is part of,154
NA,the broader changes to the youth allowance,154
NA,which will delay eligibility for Newstart,154
NA,allowance by one year and reward young,154
NA,workers with a more generous income test.,154
NA,"Again ,we are trying to encourage those",154
NA,young people who have left school to get,154
NA,into the workforce or to take on further,154
NA,education.,154
NA,I have already announced the initiatives in,154
NA,"relation to the very long term unemployed,",154
NA,and we will have a new approach to,154
NA,disadvantaged locations. I think that these,154
NA,initiatives announced in the budget by a,154
NA,federal Labor government-and it would,154
NA,only be a federal Labor government that,154
NA,would implement such initiatives to ensure,154
NA,that workers re-engage-complement what,154
NA,we are now debating in this House in relation,154
NA,to job seeker compliance and will help,154
NA,people in our communities to ensure that,154
NA,they can have the dignity of work.,154
Ms HALL ,Shortland-Government,154
NA,Whip) (17:58): I rise to support the Social,154
NA,Security Legislation Amendment (Job,154
NA,"Seeker Compliance) Bill 2011. In doing so, I",154
NA,would like to put on record my strong,154
NA,support for all initiatives that help people,154
NA,move from welfare to work. In my previous,154
NA,"life before entering parliament, I worked",154
NA,"with job seekers, both those that were in",154
NA,receipt of disability support pension and,154
NA,those that were disadvantaged and long-term,154
NA,"unemployed, so I know that there are a",154
NA,number of issues that impact on their ability,154
NA,to move from welfare to work. I am pleased,154
NA,that this legislation was referred to the House,154
NA,of Representatives Standing Committee on,154
NA,Education and Employment and I support the,154
NA,recommendations of the committee.,154
NA,It is imperative that legislation and,154
NA,information that is given to job seekers be in,154
NA,plain English. It is important that the people,154
NA,who are involved in implementing this,154
NA,legislation develop and follow consistent,154
NA,guidelines and that there is training material,154
NA,that accompanies the bill. It is also important,154
NA,that Centrelink and employment services,154
NA,staff are provided with comprehensive,154
NA,"training, as is the committee's",154
NA,recommendation. It is also important that,154
NA,employment providers be given clear and,154
NA,comprehensive guidelines in relation to this,155
NA,legislation. It is interesting that the,155
NA,committee recommends that the Department,155
NA,"of Education, Employment and Workplace",155
NA,Relations and the Department of Human,155
NA,Services collect and publish data on the,155
NA,reasons why job seekers miss appointments,155
NA,without reasonable excuses. The committee,155
NA,also recommends that the department,155
NA,undertake a review of the impact of these,155
NA,proposed changes and that employment,155
NA,service providers be advised to utilise all,155
NA,engagement mechanisms available to them in,155
NA,relation to vulnerable job seekers.,155
NA,The committee recommends,155
NA,additional training and resources be provided,155
NA,to Centrelink staff. That is probably a very,155
NA,good point for me to come in on. Since this,155
NA,bill was introduced into the parliament I have,155
NA,spent quite a bit of time liaising with officers,155
NA,who work in the Centrelink offices in my,155
NA,electorate. They have expressed some,155
NA,concern to me about this legislation and the,155
NA,impact it will have on their workload and on,155
NA,a certain subset of job seekers. I am sure that,155
NA,those issues that have been raised by,155
NA,"Centrelink staff, people who work each and",155
NA,every day with the long-term unemployed,155
NA,and people who are failing to attend,155
NA,"appointments, will be looked at during the",155
NA,review.,155
NA,I should also put on the record that I have,155
NA,been speaking with a number of job service,155
NA,providers within my electorate. We are,155
NA,working on a very innovative program in a,155
NA,"very disadvantaged area of my electorate,",155
NA,probably the most disadvantaged area in the,155
NA,"whole of Australia, on a number of issues",155
NA,that are preventing people from returning to,155
NA,work. The majority of the population in that,155
NA,area are on some sort of Centrelink payment.,155
NA,We are working together to try to develop an,155
NA,innovative approach with job seeker,155
NA,providers across state and federal and even,155
NA,local government lines to see whether we can,155
NA,come up with an approach that will help,155
NA,people.,155
NA,I do have a little concern that perhaps,155
NA,some people will have their payments,155
NA,suspended for a variety of reasons. People,155
NA,can have their payments cancelled because,155
NA,of circumstances beyond their control. We,155
NA,all know that getting payments reinstated can,155
NA,be a rather cumbersome process. I am sure,155
NA,that the Minister for Employment,155
NA,Participation and Childcare will be looking,155
NA,re- at this issue very carefully in the review. I,155
NA,think changes such as this that are designed,155
NA,to increase people's participation in work are,155
NA,that vitally important because if people do not go,155
NA,along to their appointments with Job,155
NA,Network providers then they will find it very,155
NA,difficult to move from welfare to work. We,155
NA,"just have to be very mindful that, with",155
NA,"legislation such as this, we are not actually",155
NA,going to put in place barriers that will,155
NA,"achieve a perverse outcome, the opposite",155
NA,outcome to the one we are seeking to,155
NA,achieve. For some people it will facilitate,155
NA,"their meeting those appointments, but others",155
NA,may be faced with the situation where they,155
NA,get a call to go to work late in the day and,155
NA,"they have to decide, 'Do I turn down paid",155
NA,work because I can't contact the Centrelink,155
NA,office before I go to work or during that,155
NA,"time, or do I go to work and then miss the",155
NA,appointment and have to go through the,155
NA,process of having Centrelink payments,155
NA,reinstated?' which they would have to go,155
NA,through because it is a valid excuse.,155
NA,Maybe there will need to be some,155
NA,finetuning of this legislation further down,155
NA,the track. I support initiatives that will assist,155
NA,people to move from welfare to work. It is,155
NA,vitally important. We have a skills shortage.,155
NA,I welcome a number of the initiatives in the,155
NA,budget that are designed to assist the long-,155
NA,term unemployed to move from welfare to,155
NA,work. I think the wage subsidy schemes that,155
NA,are included in the budget will assist the,155
NA,long-term unemployed and will redress some,156
NA,of the disadvantage they have when they are,156
NA,competing for jobs within the workforce. I,156
NA,have worked with job subsidy schemes in the,156
NA,past and I know they work. I know that,156
NA,people can be employed under a job subsidy,156
NA,scheme and then end up in a long-term job.,156
NA,Nothing gives a person more dignity than,156
NA,being able to work. But I do think that we,156
NA,have to monitor this legislation very closely,156
NA,to ensure that the people whom we are,156
NA,seeking to assist by encouraging them to,156
NA,attend appointments are not disadvantaged. I,156
NA,have every confidence that the minister will,156
NA,ensure that the department does this and that,156
NA,the legislation will work to benefit those,156
NA,people who are unemployed rather than,156
NA,disadvantage them.,156
NA,Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister,156
NA,for Employment Participation and Childcare,156
NA,and Minister for the Status of Women),156
NA,(18:05): I thank all members who have,156
NA,contributed to this debate. Our government,156
NA,has both reformed employment services and,156
NA,invested to improve their effectiveness. In,156
NA,"reinforcing those improvements, we",156
NA,introduced a new compliance system from 1,156
NA,"July 2009. Last night, in the 2011 budget, we",156
NA,provided for spending over the forward,156
NA,estimates towards employment services of,156
NA,some $8.5 billion. This includes a range of,156
NA,new initiatives to provide greater support for,156
NA,"the very long term unemployed, for job",156
NA,seekers with a disability and for those who,156
NA,have become disengaged. We know that with,156
NA,"this increased support, with the opportunities",156
NA,"that this support provides, so too comes",156
NA,responsibility. This bill delivers on the,156
NA,government's election commitment to,156
NA,modernising Australia's welfare system and,156
NA,introducing tougher measures to ensure that,156
NA,more unemployed people are getting back,156
NA,into work. We have a growing economy and,156
NA,a strong labour market. While millions of,156
NA,jobs have been lost in other advanced,156
NA,"economies, employment in Australia has",156
NA,"increased by around 750,000 jobs since",156
NA,"2007, driving unemployment below five per",156
NA,"cent. At just 4.9 per cent, Australia's",156
NA,unemployment rate is lower than that of,156
NA,almost any of the other major advanced,156
NA,"economies. It is at this time, with lower",156
NA,unemployment and employers searching for,156
NA,"new workers to come on board, that we must",156
NA,embrace the greater opportunities to connect,156
NA,job seekers with this employment market. It,156
NA,is crucial that we do all that we can to ensure,156
NA,that unemployment payment recipients are,156
NA,participating to the full extent of their,156
NA,"abilities. In order to do that, we need them to",156
NA,be actively engaged with the employment,156
NA,services and support that our government,156
NA,provides.,156
NA,This bill is not about punishing job,156
NA,seekers who have a valid reason for missing,156
NA,appointments or participation in activities.,156
NA,The government are aware of the challenges,156
NA,that job seekers face and we are aware that,156
NA,most job seekers are genuine in their,156
NA,"attempts to find work. However, income",156
NA,support does come with responsibility. A,156
NA,strengthening of the compliance system is,156
NA,warranted so that more job seekers are,156
NA,actively engaged in work experience,156
NA,"activities, such as training and work for the",156
NA,"dole, so that they are getting the skills and",156
NA,experience they need to find a sustainable,156
NA,job into the future.,156
NA,"Throughout this debate, whilst many",156
NA,opposition members have repeated their,156
NA,party-line talking points about nonattendance,156
NA,being a symptom of a broken system under,156
NA,"this government, the reality that everybody",156
NA,should take note of is that under the Howard,156
NA,government the appointment attendance rate,156
NA,"in 2006-07 was 54 per cent. In 2009-10,",156
NA,"under this government's compliance system,",156
NA,it was 58 per cent. I say this so that we have,157
NA,"the full facts on the table, but we know that",157
NA,neither of these figures is good enough. We,157
NA,need to work to make sure that everybody is,157
NA,engaging in the supports that are available to,157
NA,them.,157
NA,The new arrangements seek to improve,157
NA,job seekers' attendance at employment,157
NA,services provider and related appointments.,157
NA,Suspension of payment provides a strong and,157
NA,immediate incentive for job seekers who,157
NA,miss appointments to re-engage quickly.,157
NA,When a job seeker's payment is suspended,157
NA,"following a missed appointment, they get all",157
NA,of their money back once they do what is,157
NA,required of them: attend their appointment.,157
NA,This is an effective way of encouraging,157
NA,compliance without taking the punitive,157
NA,approach of immediately applying a penalty,157
NA,that the job seeker cannot get back. The,157
NA,principle that no job seeker should actually,157
NA,lose payment without a warning or a second,157
NA,chance to comply will remain in place. The,157
NA,current range of legislative,157
NA,administrative protections for vulnerable job,157
NA,"seekers will remain in place, with the",157
NA,additional provision that they will not be,157
NA,subject to suspension of payment in the first,157
NA,instance.,157
NA,The House of Representatives Standing,157
NA,Committee on Education and Employment,157
NA,"has scrutinised this bill, as recommended by",157
NA,"this parliament, and only this morning tabled",157
NA,its report. I thank the members of the,157
NA,committee for their work and assure them,157
NA,that the government will give serious,157
NA,consideration to all of,157
NA,"recommendations. Indeed, at first reading, I",157
NA,can give in-principle support to all the,157
NA,recommendations.,157
NA,"On the specifics of this bill, the committee",157
NA,makes one specific recommendation,157
NA,"regarding this legislation-that is, that we",157
NA,remove the word 'special' from the proposed,157
NA,"subsection 42UA, where it is used to",157
NA,describe a situation in which a job seeker,157
NA,would not be expected to give prior notice of,157
NA,their inability to attend an appointment.,157
NA,Following discussions with the opposition,157
NA,and given that the details of circumstances,157
NA,that will be excepted will in fact be,157
NA,"explained in guidelines to Centrelink, the",157
NA,government has no objection to this,157
NA,recommendation.,157
NA,The government has noted a number of,157
NA,committee recommendations around,157
NA,additional measures in relation to this matter.,157
NA,"In fact, participation and compliance",157
NA,arrangements are important to ensuring that,157
NA,"job seekers engage with education, training",157
NA,"and work experience opportunities and, by",157
NA,"working with their providers, move off",157
NA,income support and into paid employment.,157
NA,We know that the current framework is,157
NA,"working. In 2010, 82 per cent of job seekers",157
NA,"satisfied their requirements, with no",157
NA,participation reports submitted. A further,157
NA,and nine per cent received only one participation,157
NA,"report. However, a small number of job",157
NA,"seekers-in fact, just two per cent-were the",157
NA,subject of over one-third of participation,157
NA,reports for failing to meet their obligations.,157
NA,"As I mentioned earlier, the budget",157
NA,introduced by the Treasurer last night,157
NA,included funding for a range of new,157
NA,"employment initiatives, including some",157
NA,$49.8 million for job seeker compliance and,157
NA,participation related measures to improve,157
NA,"and streamline the system, to provide",157
NA,targeted assistance to those job seekers who,157
NA,their are most at risk of noncompliance and,157
NA,disengagement and to improve our,157
NA,communication of these measures. The,157
NA,measures announced in the budget follow,157
NA,consideration of the recommendations of the,157
NA,Independent Review of the Job Seeker,157
NA,Compliance Framework-the Disney,157
NA,review. They build on the job seeker,157
NA,compliance bill currently before the,158
NA,"parliament, which provides for immediate",158
NA,suspension of payment for nonattendance at,158
NA,provider appointments or activities. These,158
NA,budget measures and this bill are consistent,158
NA,with the government's approach to job seeker,158
NA,"compliance, which focuses on early",158
NA,intervention and the use of immediate,158
NA,corrective action to keep job seekers on the,158
NA,"right path. They will benefit job seekers,",158
NA,especially those who are vulnerable or,158
NA,disengaged. The measures will also help,158
NA,providers by reducing complexity and,158
NA,increasing transparency.,158
NA,All Australians on income support should,158
NA,"have the opportunity of work, but with this",158
NA,"opportunity, of course,",158
NA,responsibilities. With this bill we are going,158
NA,to firmly expect that people meet those,158
NA,responsibilities. I commend the bill to the,158
NA,House.,158
NA,Question agreed to.,158
NA,Bill read a second time.,158
NA,Consideration in Detail,158
NA,Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.,158
NA,Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister,158
NA,for Employment Participation and Childcare,158
NA,and Minister for the Status of Women),158
NA,(18:13): I present a supplementary,158
NA,explanatory memorandum to the bill and ask,158
NA,leave of the House to move government,158
NA,"amendments (1) to (3), as circulated,",158
NA,together.,158
NA,Leave granted.,158
NA,Ms KATE ELLIS: I move government,158
NA,"amendments (1) to (3), as circulated,",158
NA,together:,158
NA,"(1) Schedule 1, item 15, page 7 (table item 1),",158
NA,"omit ""special"".",158
NA,"(2) Schedule 1, item 15, page 7 (table item",158
NA,"omit ""special"".",158
NA,"(3) Schedule 1, item 15, page 8 (table item 3),",158
NA,"omit ""special"".",158
Mr BANDT ,Melbourne) (18:14): These,158
NA,amendments are supported for the reasons,158
NA,that have been outlined by the minister. Mr,158
NA,"Deputy Speaker, with your and the House's",158
NA,"indulgence, I seek to make a few general",158
NA,comments about the remaining provisions of,158
NA,the bill. I ought to have made them earlier,158
NA,"but, perhaps somewhat ironically, I was late",158
NA,and I hope that I will not be punished on this,158
NA,occasion for missing that appointment.,158
NA,If there was ever any proof needed that,158
NA,evidence based policy will give way to,158
NA,perceived political imperative every time it is,158
NA,the Social Security Legislation Amendment,158
NA,comes (Job Seeker Compliance) Bill 2011 and the,158
NA,"committee inquiry process that led to it,",158
NA,"which I participated in. The aim of this bill,",158
NA,"as has been set out by the minister, is to",158
NA,impose financial sanctions on people who,158
NA,"miss appointments. One might expect, then,",158
NA,that there would be a significant amount of,158
NA,data or research done by either the,158
NA,"government, the department or independent",158
NA,experts about why it is that people miss,158
NA,"appointments. What we found, though,",158
NA,during the committee inquiry process is that,158
NA,although we knew that 20 per cent of people,158
NA,who miss appointments are Indigenous,158
NA,"Australians, and although 47 per cent of",158
NA,"them are young, we do not know why it is",158
NA,that they are missing appointments-no-one,158
NA,could tell us. Witness after witness agreed,158
NA,with the proposition that it would be sensible,158
NA,to find out why it is that people are missing,158
NA,appointments and then to put in place the,158
NA,appropriate processes to ensure that they,158
NA,attended those appointments.,158
NA,"Also, almost everyone who was involved",158
NA,in the provision of job services appeared,158
NA,"2), before the inquiry-with some exceptions-",158
NA,to say that this would destroy the relationship,158
NA,of trust that job service providers had with,159
NA,people who were seeking employment and,159
NA,"would make them less likely to engage, and",159
NA,that it might lead to instances where people,159
NA,decide that the whole thing is too hard and,159
NA,they do not want to participate in the system,159
NA,at all.,159
NA,The government based much of its,159
NA,justification for this bill on the independent,159
NA,review into the bill that it commissioned last,159
NA,"year, which was chaired by Professor Julian",159
NA,Disney. Professor Disney appeared before,159
NA,the committee inquiry into this bill to say,159
NA,"that he did not support it, that it was",159
NA,"premature, that it was not consistent with the",159
NA,report and that the only reason he even,159
NA,mentioned it in his original report was that it,159
NA,came up in the context of an election,159
NA,"campaign. He, along with many others,",159
NA,agreed that there is an implicit assumption in,159
NA,this bill that people simply do not want to,159
NA,comply with the system and therefore do not,159
NA,turn up. But others before the committee,159
NA,made the very simple point that the people,159
NA,who want to rort the system are the ones who,159
NA,are going to turn up to every appointment,159
NA,because they will want to make sure that,159
NA,under no circumstances will they be kicked,159
NA,off. We know from the statistics that the ones,159
NA,who are most likely to suffer as a result of,159
NA,this bill are Indigenous Australians and,159
NA,"young people, and according to the evidence",159
NA,presented to the committee inquiry they are,159
NA,more than likely to be those suffering from,159
NA,"some kind of mental illness, those who find",159
NA,"the whole system confusing, and those who",159
NA,are most at the fringes of society and most at,159
NA,risk of exclusion.,159
NA,I do support the amendment that has been,159
NA,proposed because it will go some way in,159
NA,"reducing some of the confusion in the bill,",159
NA,but I will not be supporting the bill.,159

Mr MORRISON ,Cook) (18:20): The,159
NA,stated aim of the Migration Amendment,159
NA,"(Complementary Protection) Bill 2011,",159
NA,"reintroduced in this session of parliament, is",159
NA,to allow onshore claims to be made and,159
NA,considered under a new statutory process for,159
NA,a single visa application against all our non-,159
NA,refoulement obligations contained in,159
NA,"instruments to which Australia is a signatory,",159
NA,other than the Refugee Convention and,159
NA,protocol. These include the International,159
NA,"Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the",159
NA,Second Optional Protocol to the International,159
NA,Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the,159
NA,"abolition of the death penalty, the",159
NA,Convention on the Rights of the Child and,159
NA,the Convention against Torture and Other,159
NA,"Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or",159
NA,Punishment.,159
NA,Complementary protection is a term that,159
NA,describes a state's obligations to those people,159
NA,who whilst not meeting the 1951 Refugee,159
NA,Convention definition and associated,159
NA,protocols are nonetheless in need of,159
NA,protection on the basis that they face serious,160
NA,violations of their rights if sent back to,160
NA,country of origin. This principle of non-,160
NA,refoulement is one that not only exists in all,160
NA,of these conventions and other treaties but,160
NA,also has become an established principle of,160
NA,"international law more broadly, and that is a",160
NA,good thing. These amendments create a new,160
NA,statutory process to deal with applications.,160
NA,They create a new pathway for people who,160
NA,otherwise do not qualify as refugees to come,160
NA,to Australia to make and engage an onshore,160
NA,"claim under another process. Currently, the",160
NA,minister considers all genuine applications,160
NA,against our international non-refoulement,160
NA,obligations when asked to exercise his,160
NA,intervention powers under the act. These,160
NA,decisions are non-reviewable.,160
NA,ministerial intervention model has the,160
NA,advantage of allowing the minister to deal,160
NA,flexibly and constructively with specific,160
NA,cases of individuals and families whose,160
NA,circumstances are invariably one-off and,160
NA,"complex, and who maybe disadvantaged by a",160
NA,"rigidly codified criteria, administered by",160
NA,departmental officials and subject to other,160
NA,broader processes. These are complex,160
NA,"situations, they are difficult situations and",160
NA,they are amongst the very few cases that are,160
NA,found to be valid and where visas are,160
NA,granted. They involve devastating situations,160
NA,and they are genuine cases.,160
NA,The minister's office has confirmed that,160
NA,no-one who would be considered under the,160
NA,new provisions provided for in this bill have,160
NA,previously failed to obtain a protection,160
NA,outcome under the current arrangements.,160
NA,The debate is not about whether genuine,160
NA,people with claims under these treaties,160
NA,should or should not receive protection. This,160
NA,"House, I think, is at one in honouring those",160
NA,treaties. The issue is how we go about that,160
NA,process and what others issues that gives rise,160
NA,to.,160
NA,It has also been confirmed that the number,160
NA,their of genuine applicants in this category is,160
NA,actually very small. Between 1 January 2010,160
NA,"and 22 October 2010, the minister finalised",160
NA,"1,690 requests for intervention. Of those, the",160
NA,minister granted visas to a total of 438,160
NA,"people. According to the minister's office, of",160
NA,"those 438 visas, only six satisfied the",160
NA,requirements of the proposed new,160
NA,"complementary protection provisions. So, at",160
NA,"the end of the day, we are dealing with six",160
NA,applications that were considered genuine at,160
NA,that time.,160
NA,In evidence to the Senate committee,160
NA,which previously considered the bill in the,160
NA,"last parliament, DIAC advised that of the",160
NA,606 visas granted by the minister using,160
NA,"The section 417 powers in the 2008-09 program,",160
NA,only 55 were granted under the humanitarian,160
NA,program and less than half of these cases,160
NA,"involved non-refoulement issues, the subject",160
NA,of this bill.,160
NA,Consistent with evidence previously,160
NA,"provided to the Senate committee, DIAC and",160
NA,the minister's office have reconfirmed that,160
NA,they do not expect the numbers of applicants,160
NA,being granted protection visas under these,160
NA,provisions to increase at all. This begs the,160
NA,question as to why the government now,160
NA,believe it is necessary to introduce a,160
NA,"statutory framework, a new process, to deal",160
NA,"with such a small number of cases, having",160
NA,decided during the last parliament to allow,160
NA,the bill to lapse.,160
NA,"The bill, in substance, is largely the same",160
NA,as the one abandoned by the government,160
NA,during the last term. The bill was first,160
NA,introduced into the House of Representatives,160
NA,on 9 September 2009 by the then,160
NA,Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural,160
NA,"Affairs and Settlement Services, who I have",160
NA,to say did a very good job in that role. It was,160
NA,"not debated and it lapsed on 19 July 2010,",160
NA,when parliament was prorogued for the 2010,161
NA,election.,161
NA,This bill is different in that it has,161
NA,"simplified some definitions, removed the",161
NA,"need for a risk of irreparable harm, replaced",161
NA,references to complementary protection,161
NA,criteria as matters with a definition of,161
NA,'significant harm' and amended the,161
NA,requirement that the non-citizen have the,161
NA,death penalty imposed and it will be carried,161
NA,out-'and' is the key word there. There are,161
NA,some minor amendments that pick up on,161
NA,some of the issues raised in the Senate,161
NA,"committee. In substance, the bill is",161
NA,essentially that which was presented in the,161
NA,last parliamentary term and one that could,161
NA,"have picked up these matters at that time, but",161
NA,the government chose not to do so. The bill,161
NA,also introduces these definitions in a range of,161
NA,"areas, but I think it is fairly clear what they",161
NA,are for those who have had the opportunity,161
NA,to read the bill.,161
NA,A new subclause 36(2B) provides a,161
NA,"number of exclusion clauses, including that a",161
NA,real risk does not exist if the risk is,161
NA,the population of the country generally and is,161
NA,not faced by the non-citizen personally.,161
NA,Other exclusions include those who have,161
NA,committed serious crimes. These are,161
NA,important exclusions.,161
NA,"In deciding to reintroduce the bill, the",161
NA,government advised that the minister had,161
NA,strong representations from the refugee,161
NA,advocacy sector. We understand that they,161
NA,neither sought nor received advice from the,161
NA,"Australian Federal Police, the Customs and",161
NA,"Border Protection Service, ASIO or any",161
NA,other relevant agency about the potential,161
NA,impact of this measure to act as an incentive,161
NA,for people smuggling. That concerns me.,161
NA,This is a matter that clearly could have,161
NA,implications in this area and the opinion and,161
NA,advice of those agencies is critical to a,161
NA,decision to reintroduce this measure at this,161
NA,time into this parliament. It is not even clear,161
NA,whether a request was made for their advice.,161
NA,"I understand none was, but I would happily",161
NA,be corrected on that point.,161
NA,The government's revised proposal will,161
NA,only widen the grounds for asylum seekers to,161
NA,"make an onshore protection claim and,",161
NA,"frankly, will put another product on the",161
NA,"people smugglers' shelf, at a time when we",161
NA,"can least afford to do so, while failing to",161
NA,extend legitimate protection to one additional,161
NA,person who genuinely needs it.,161
NA,The department and the minister's,161
NA,predictions about the small number of cases,161
NA,that would be approved under this new,161
NA,regime have an ominous echo of previous,161
NA,assurances given when a similar regime was,161
NA,introduced in the early 1980s and abandoned,161
NA,"in 1989. In 1981, the Fraser government",161
NA,introduced the infamous section 6A(1)(e).,161
NA,This provision allowed an entry permit to be,161
NA,"granted where there were 'strong,",161
NA,compassionate and humanitarian grounds'.,161
NA,These permits were to be provided to those,161
NA,faced by who did not meet other more specific,161
NA,migrant entry criteria. The decisions on these,161
NA,permits were judicially reviewable.,161
NA,It was claimed at the time these measures,161
NA,were introduced that they would deal with,161
NA,around 100 successful applicants per year. In,161
NA,"1981-82, 226 applications were approved.",161
NA,"By 1987 this figure had risen to 3,260. In",161
NA,"1989, then Labor immigration minister,",161
NA,"Senator Robert Ray, realised that the system",161
NA,had run off the rails and repealed the,161
NA,measure. At the time this measure was,161
NA,"repealed-and remember, this was a measure",161
NA,that was going to produce around 100,161
NA,successful applicants per year-there were,161
NA,"8,000 outstanding applications covering",161
NA,"some 10,000 persons. The Federal Court's",161
NA,interpretation of who should be provided,161
NA,protection under these measures transformed,161
NA,"a provision intended to be exceptional, I am",161
NA,"sure with all good intentions, into one that",162
NA,became routine. Where the department,162
NA,"intended that strong, compassionate or",162
NA,humanitarian grounds applied only to,162
NA,applicants who had a fear of a 'substantial,162
NA,"violation of human rights', a series of very",162
NA,creative court decisions led to a requirement,162
NA,that applicants only had to show that if they,162
NA,"were forced to leave Australia, they would",162
NA,face a situation which would 'evoke strong,162
NA,feelings of pity or compassion in an ordinary,162
NA,member of the Australian public'. During,162
NA,"Senate estimates questioning in 2009, shortly",162
NA,after the bill was introduced for the first,162
NA,"time, Senator Fierravanti-Wells put the",162
NA,experience of section 6A(1)(e) to the,162
NA,department and the minister. The secretary of,162
NA,the department declared that 'this is,162
NA,"completely different', because the criteria",162
NA,under the three conventions covered are,162
NA,quite clear in relation to non-refoulement,162
NA,obligations. The secretary said:,162
NA,We assess the potential for there to be a blow-,162
NA,out or even a statutory or judicial interpretation,162
NA,vastly widen the criteria as 'nil'.,162
NA,That is a fairly bold and dramatic claim.,162
NA,"Frankly, I do not share that confidence.",162
NA,"Indeed, the budget last night set out more",162
NA,than $100 million in new expenditure to deal,162
NA,with court appeals following the High,162
NA,Court's decision to strike down the,162
NA,government's former non-statutory process,162
NA,"for considering refugee assessments,",162
NA,"introduced by the government in July 2008,",162
NA,which was believed to be quarantined from,162
NA,judicial review. In February the department,162
NA,was asked in estimates how much extra they,162
NA,would have to pay as a result of that High,162
NA,"Court decision, and they boldly stated in a",162
NA,written answer that it would be met from,162
NA,existing appropriations in terms of the cost of,162
NA,any further actions. Those appropriations last,162
NA,night had to be increased by more than $100,162
NA,million. We are already paying the price for,162
NA,misplaced confidence in the measures that,162
NA,have been introduced by the government in,162
NA,these areas. We have gone over those in,162
NA,some detail during the last 48 hours in this,162
NA,place as the government has sought to put,162
NA,forward new measures that are apparently,162
NA,"the new great answer. But, sadly, we know",162
NA,how these measures often end with this,162
NA,government.,162
NA,I do not share the confidence that what,162
NA,was intended to be a fairly small matter-,162
NA,enabling people with a genuine claim to be,162
NA,given genuine protection-could not follow,162
NA,suit of previous experience of our country in,162
NA,this area. We have system blow-outs being,162
NA,"gained in the system and, frankly, we end up",162
NA,just putting another product on the people,162
NA,smugglers' shelf. For what purpose and at,162
NA,"what gain? Our system, as the minister",162
NA,"himself will acknowledge, is not denying a",162
NA,person who would be given protection under,162
NA,this measure protection that they are not,162
NA,"already receiving. As I said, the Federal",162
NA,to Court's interpretation in this matter now,162
NA,provides the opportunity to get involved in,162
NA,reviewing these decisions and to go well,162
NA,beyond what may be considered by this,162
NA,"parliament, and that could lead us down a",162
NA,very similar path to what we saw on the,162
NA,earlier occasion.,162
NA,It seems that eight days after having been,162
NA,"sworn in as the new minister, the minister",162
NA,was reported in the Age as having said-and,162
NA,I make this comment in terms of reasserting,162
NA,his own commitment to this bill as,162
NA,something that he believes is important:,162
NA,Labor would seek to widen the criteria by,162
NA,which people can apply for protection before,162
NA,Parliament breaks for summer.,162
NA,"He did not quite make that goal but,",162
NA,"nevertheless, it has been introduced. He",162
NA,further said:,162
NA,We'll be proceeding with that bill. ... I,163
NA,an important measure. Out of the immigration,163
NA,"legislation that is outstanding, I see that as the",163
NA,most important.,163
NA,By contrast our current system enables,163
NA,legitimate claims to be identified and,163
NA,addressed while not opening up the system to,163
NA,the vexatious onshore claims to game the,163
NA,"system in our courts, or allow a broader",163
NA,interpretation of the intended measures by,163
NA,the courts. The government are concerned,163
NA,that no-one who would be considered would,163
NA,be denied. They have also confirmed that the,163
NA,number of genuine applicants is very small.,163
NA,A senate inquiry into the proposal when it,163
NA,was floated by the government during the,163
NA,last parliamentary time focused almost,163
NA,entirely on the issue of variance in judicial,163
NA,and administrative interpretation of fixed,163
NA,criteria. There is a very strong argument that,163
NA,codification of this criteria may serve to both,163
NA,constrain our opportunity to provide,163
NA,protection as much as extend such protection,163
NA,beyond what was intended through these,163
NA,treaties and conventions.,163
NA,The inquiry also canvassed criticism of,163
NA,the current process as being 'administratively,163
NA,inefficient' on the basis that applicants 'must,163
NA,apply for a visa for which they are not,163
NA,eligible and exhaust merits review before,163
NA,their claim can be considered' by the,163
NA,minister. This criticism ignores the capacity,163
NA,of the minister to intervene under section,163
NA,195A of the Migration Act to grant a visa to,163
NA,a person in detention whether or not they,163
NA,applied for one if he or she considers it is in,163
NA,the public interest to do so.,163
NA,A pre-removal clearance process is also,163
NA,undertaken by DIAC in which they assess,163
NA,whether the removal or deportation of an,163
NA,asylum seeker could otherwise engage,163
NA,Australia's non-refoulement obligations,163
NA,under international human rights instruments,163
NA,to which Australia is a party. These measures,163
NA,see it as seem to be more than adequate additional,163
NA,safeguards.,163
NA,I appreciate there are some in the,163
NA,community who believe more is necessary.,163
NA,The great risk though is that by going down,163
NA,that path we open up the opportunity for,163
NA,vexatious claims and for systems to be,163
NA,abused. Particularly in the current,163
NA,environment the opportunity for that is at,163
NA,what I would call a 'high alert level'. In the,163
NA,process they undermine yet another avenue,163
NA,and opportunity for the government to move,163
NA,to provide protection to those who are in,163
NA,genuine need of it. The system currently is,163
NA,"addressing those issues, maybe not to the",163
NA,satisfaction or the speed to which people,163
NA,would like or appreciate. But the way it,163
NA,works effectively provides a vetting system,163
NA,where the genuine applications rise to the,163
NA,"top. When they do, this minister, the",163
NA,previous minister and the ministers that came,163
NA,from this side of the House have all acted to,163
NA,provide that protection when it has been,163
NA,deemed necessary.,163
NA,"Liberal senators at the inquiry, when the",163
NA,"bill was considered in the last parliament,",163
NA,submitted a dissenting report opposing the,163
NA,passage of the 2009 bill. The coalition will,163
NA,not be supporting this current bill. They said,163
NA,at that time that: the existing ministerial,163
NA,intervention process is a safeguard that has,163
NA,been in place for decades; it is a tried and,163
NA,proven system; there was no evidence that,163
NA,the ministerial intervention process has been,163
NA,anything other than effective; primary,163
NA,"decisions would be appealable which, in",163
NA,"turn, would lengthen the time in which cases",163
NA,remain unresolved and exacerbate an already,163
NA,fraught situation; codification risks curtailing,163
NA,discretion otherwise available to help,163
NA,genuine refugees languishing in camps,163
NA,around the world; and the bill would,163
NA,encourage the lodgement of non-refugee,163
NA,protection applications and the making of,163
NA,false asylum claims. They were the points,163
NA,made at the time and they are the same,164
NA,points the coalition makes today. They were,164
NA,the points made at the time and they are the,164
NA,same points the coalition makes today.,164
NA,"Indeed, in a submission to the inquiry, Dr",164
NA,Ben Saul of the University of Sydney was of,164
NA,the view that the criteria contained in the,164
NA,2009 bill were 'poorly drafted as a result of,164
NA,the inclusion of unnecessary qualifying,164
NA,"phrases' and, far from creating certainty,",164
NA,would invite needless litigation. I believe,164
NA,those concerns remain valid. Vexatious,164
NA,"claims, where every negative decision can be",164
NA,"appealed, will also create further pressure on",164
NA,an already overstressed court system. It,164
NA,would also add further pressure to a,164
NA,detention network already in crisis and,164
NA,stretched beyond capacity.,164
NA,In the time between this bill's introduction stressed.,164
NA,"into the House and today, these figures have",164
NA,become worse. At the time the bill was,164
NA,introduced around 53 per cent of the people,164
NA,who were in detention had been there for six,164
NA,months or more. That has now risen to 60,164
NA,"per cent of the record 6,872 population of",164
NA,our detention network who have been held,164
NA,for more than six months. The costs in this,164
NA,area have also blown out by more than $1.75,164
NA,"billion on one line item alone-output 4.3,",164
NA,offshore asylum seeker management-,164
NA,between the budget announcement last night,164
NA,and a year ago. That is a staggering figure.,164
NA,When you include the additional costs of,164
NA,capital that have been introduced over that,164
NA,12-month period that figure rises to more,164
NA,than $2 billion in just one year.,164
NA,This is not a time for adding further stress,164
NA,and strain to a system that has already,164
NA,collapsed under the pressures of his,164
NA,government's failures. This is not a time to,164
NA,be engaging in adding further opportunities,164
NA,and products for people smugglers to put on,164
NA,the table. It will allow and encourage people,164
NA,to try their chances-to game the system-,164
NA,for those we know will not meet the,164
NA,obligations of the refugee convention. We,164
NA,simply open up another pathway without one,164
NA,additional genuine applicant believed to be,164
NA,benefiting from these new processes. The,164
NA,"outcome, based on the government's own",164
NA,"representations, would be the same as that",164
NA,we have now. The process would be,164
NA,different but the outcome would be the same.,164
NA,"We have had violent riots, destruction of",164
NA,Commonwealth property and harm to,164
NA,"persons, including self harm. This will all",164
NA,continue in the rolling crisis we have. In all,164
NA,likelihood this will increase not only in,164
NA,"number, but in severity as the pressure",164
NA,continues to mount as more people arrive,164
NA,and our detention centres become even more,164
NA,There is a very great risk that the decision,164
NA,to provide a new channel for asylum claims,164
NA,for those who arrive illegally and are not,164
NA,refugees will just place another product on,164
NA,the shelf. The government's weakened border,164
NA,protection and immigration policies have,164
NA,already created a strong perception that those,164
NA,who seek to enter Australia illegally will,164
NA,advantage their opportunity to secure an,164
NA,immigration outcome by getting on a boat.,164
NA,"Since the government weakened the regime,",164
NA,224 boats have arrived carrying more than,164
NA,"11,000 people. That includes-and we",164
NA,should always remember this-the ill fated,164
NA,"SIEV 36, that was set alight, the even more",164
NA,ill fated SIEV 221 that crashed against the,164
NA,"rocks of Christmas Island, and, what would",164
NA,"seem to be another tragedy, a vessel that is",164
NA,believed to have left Indonesia last,164
NA,November with 91 people on board who we,164
NA,have not heard from since. I know that,164
NA,matter has been raised with the government,164
NA,and I know we are not in a position to know,164
NA,"what happened to that vessel. It is, as we",164
NA,"understand, most likely outside our waters. I",164
NA,"commend to the member for Gorton, the",165
NA,"minister at the table, the opportunity to raise",165
NA,matters with the Indonesian government and,165
NA,"others with whom we work closely, and I",165
NA,"know with whom he works closely, to see if",165
NA,they can shed any light on this issue in order,165
NA,to bring some comfort to the families in,165
NA,Australia who believe they had people on,165
NA,that vessel. It is no admission of,165
NA,"responsibility on the government's part, I",165
NA,"believe, to have in some way intercepted that",165
NA,"vessel outside Australian waters, or in any",165
NA,way had some obligation to go beyond our,165
NA,responsibilities to find it. When people get,165
NA,"on these boats this is the risk they take, but",165
NA,is another terrible reminder-another 91,165
NA,souls who are likely to have perished at sea.,165
NA,The reason more people are coming to,165
NA,"Australia, the government has now I think",165
NA,accepted and agreed by their more recent,165
NA,"decisions, is that the push factor argument",165
NA,that has been perpetrated for some years as,165
NA,the boats continued to arrive is exactly that: a,165
NA,political argument that has now fallen foul of,165
NA,"the government's own actions and decisions,",165
NA,which have betrayed what has really been,165
NA,going on. You do not start to change your,165
NA,domestic policies if you do not think those,165
NA,domestic policies are providing a pull factor.,165
NA,Now we see the Prime Minister seeking to,165
NA,"change some domestic policies, so clearly",165
NA,she believes that domestic policy has been a,165
NA,factor in attracting such a large number of,165
NA,vessels. It is not hard to work that out when,165
NA,the government's own figures show that if an,165
NA,Afghan applies offshore they have a one in,165
NA,"10 chance of being granted a visa, based on",165
NA,"the figures for 2009-10, but if they got on a",165
NA,boat and sought to arrive in Australia nine,165
NA,"out of 10, in the first nine months of 2010,",165
NA,got a positive refugee assessment. That is an,165
NA,incredibly strong incentive to get on a boat.,165
NA,The opening of another avenue for,165
NA,onshore applications that goes beyond the,165
NA,requirements of the Refugee Convention,165
NA,runs the risk of creating a further policy,165
NA,"incentive for people smuggling, while, by",165
NA,"their own admission, not assisting one extra",165
NA,"genuine claimant. By contrast, the current",165
NA,process maintains a flexibility that avoids,165
NA,"these outcomes, while affording protection to",165
NA,"those who need it, consistent with our treaty",165
NA,and other obligations. I want to underscore,165
NA,that last point. I would hope there is no,165
NA,"suggestion that anyone in this House or,",165
NA,"indeed, the other chamber would have any",165
NA,sympathy with a view that would not have,165
NA,Australia meet its treaty obligations in these,165
NA,areas. We all share those commitments. Our,165
NA,it difference of view about this bill relates to,165
NA,process. We believe the same outcome can,165
NA,be achieved by maintaining the system that is,165
NA,"currently in place, without exacerbating the",165
NA,clear catastrophe of problems we have on our,165
NA,"borders, in our detention centres and in the",165
NA,budget of dealing with asylum seeker policy,165
NA,in this country.,165
NA,The coalition simply do not want to be in,165
NA,"the position, yet again, of having to say that",165
NA,we warned the government of the risks of,165
NA,changing these systems. This is yet another,165
NA,change. This is yet another alteration to the,165
NA,set of arrangements that were put in place,165
NA,and followed by the coalition government in,165
NA,dealing with the matters of border protection,165
NA,and of ensuring that we did not provide,165
NA,incentives for people to come and chance,165
NA,their arm on claims when those claims were,165
NA,"vexatious or, frankly, for people to seek to",165
NA,advance their claims by coming to Australia,165
NA,by boat in particular and illegally more,165
NA,broadly. We do not want to encourage that,165
NA,practice. We want to discourage that,165
NA,"practice. By setting up other pathways, other",165
NA,"opportunities for application, we think that is",165
NA,what this bill actually does with no ultimate,165
NA,greater gain in terms of those who are,165
NA,genuine claimants being given protection.,165
NA,We do not want to be in the position to,165
NA,say that we warned the government of the,165
NA,"risk of changing these systems, and we",166
NA,provide that warning here again. Mr Deputy,166
NA,"Speaker, I would hope and you would hope",166
NA,that they would have learned from the scale,166
NA,of their failure to date in these areas,166
NA,take these risks. It would seem by the,166
NA,government's insistence on pushing this bill,166
NA,back into this House that they have not,166
NA,learned those lessons. The coalition will not,166
NA,"be supporting this bill, and we encourage the",166
NA,government to reconsider bringing this bill,166
NA,the parliament at this time and urge them to,166
NA,maintain the system that has served,166
NA,governments well on both sides of this,166
NA,House for many years.,166
Dr LEIGH ,"Fraser) (18:47): As a child,",166
NA,four years of my childhood were spent in,166
NA,"Malaysia and Indonesia, including attending",166
NA,primary school in Banda Aceh. I was there,166
NA,because my father was working on an,166
NA,AusAID project to improve education in,166
NA,Indonesia. As the only white child in my,166
NA,"class, I came to appreciate perspectives and",166
NA,cultures quite different from my own. It also,166
NA,does not hurt to have the experience of being,166
NA,the outsider.,166
NA,Australia is a modern nation. Our,166
NA,humanitarian ethos has advanced,166
NA,"considerably since 1951, when the Refugee",166
NA,Convention was originally drafted. Our,166
NA,moral attitudes towards asylum applicants,166
NA,can no longer be bottlenecked by a,166
NA,convention written in the context of post-war,166
NA,Europe. Those who require humanitarian,166
NA,refuge but fall outside the 1951 convention,166
NA,include individuals who are at risk of being,166
NA,"subjected to the death penalty, such as a",166
NA,woman at risk of an 'honour killing' or,166
NA,"domestic abuse, or a person who would be",166
NA,prosecuted on the basis of their sexuality.,166
NA,These are all people of whom the vast,166
NA,majority of Australians would feel that the,166
NA,federal government has a duty to protect.,166
NA,Does the coalition really believe that,166
NA,someone who would be jailed for being gay,166
NA,in their home country does not deserve our,166
NA,protection? Is a woman who is at risk of an,166
NA,not to honour killing really a woman who is,166
NA,making a vexatious refugee claim?,166
NA,The Migration Amendment,166
NA,(Complementary Protection) Bill 2011 will,166
NA,provide an international standard,166
NA,complementary protection regime for those,166
NA,to individuals seeking protection visas under,166
NA,Australia's non-refoulement (non-return),166
NA,obligations. The bill will ensure that,166
NA,Australia continues to meet non-return,166
NA,obligations in a transparent and,166
NA,"compassionate fashion, according with the",166
NA,International Covenant on Civil and Political,166
NA,Rights; the Convention Against Torture and,166
NA,"Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading",166
NA,Treatment or Punishment; and the,166
NA,Convention on the Rights of the Child.,166
NA,The current bill reasserts the government's,166
NA,position to ensure that Australia meets its,166
NA,international legal and moral obligations.,166
NA,Rather than relying on an informal system,166
NA,employed at the discretion of the Minister for,166
NA,"Immigration and Citizenship, the new",166
NA,complementary protection legislation reflects,166
NA,the Gillard government's commitment to,166
NA,humane and just treatment of asylum,166
NA,seekers. This amendment will update an,166
NA,outdated law-a law that is now over two,166
NA,"decades old. A number of legal academics,",166
NA,human rights lawyers and local and,166
NA,international humanitarian groups have noted,166
NA,that relying on a regime which is non-,166
NA,"reviewable, non-compellable and wholly",166
NA,dependent on personal discretion is far from,166
NA,"ideal. Under current arrangements, those",166
NA,seeking complementary protection are,166
NA,referred to the minister through section 417,166
NA,of the Migration Act. After review criteria,166
NA,"are met, the minister may then exercise his or",166
NA,her discretion to intervene and grant the,167
NA,individual a protection visa.,167
NA,It is well-known that this process is,167
NA,inefficient and time-consuming. It adds,167
NA,stress to the applicants. The discretionary,167
NA,role of the minister in this process causes,167
NA,excessive uncertainty and delays for,167
NA,applicants seeking protection. Over the,167
NA,"years, a broad consensus has formed over the",167
NA,need for complementary protection,167
NA,provisions to be explicitly incorporated into,167
NA,domestic legislation. Groups supportive of,167
NA,such a legal codification include: the United,167
NA,Nations; the Australian Human Rights,167
NA,Commission; Amnesty International; the,167
NA,Uniting Church; the Law Council of,167
NA,Australia; and the Refugee Council of,167
NA,Australia.,167
NA,I would also note that the codification of,167
NA,complementary protection has,167
NA,recommended by several parliamentary,167
NA,"committees, the most recent being the 2009",167
NA,Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs,167
NA,Committee. The passage of this bill would,167
NA,place Australia along with nations such as,167
NA,"Canada, the United States, New Zealand and",167
NA,27 member states of the European Union. All,167
NA,of these nations have already moved to,167
NA,"create harmonized, legal approaches to non-",167
NA,refoulement by codifying complementary,167
NA,protection within domestic laws. This is not,167
NA,a risky reform. This is not a radical reform.,167
NA,This is a common-sense reform. The bill,167
NA,"ensures transparency, due process and",167
NA,consistent humanitarian outcomes and,167
NA,removes concern regarding the use of a non-,167
NA,codified system to address complementary,167
NA,protection obligations.,167
NA,This government does not believe that,167
NA,introducing a legislated complementary,167
NA,protection framework will increase people-,167
NA,"smuggling. The single procedure process,",167
NA,"already in place in the UK, the Netherlands,",167
NA,"Canada and Ireland, will assess all claims for",167
NA,"protective asylum, first against the refugees",167
NA,"convention, and only then move to",167
NA,assessment under complementary protection,167
NA,criteria. Nor will this bill increase the,167
NA,number of protection places allocated to new,167
NA,arrivals. It should be remembered that those,167
NA,"granted protection asylum, who are not",167
NA,recognised as refugees under the 1951,167
NA,convention but still owed complementary,167
NA,"protection, are dealt with under the existing",167
NA,discretionary arrangement. This bill acts only,167
NA,to improve the system.,167
NA,The bill also saves administrative,167
NA,resources and relieves some of the pressure,167
NA,put on decision makers within the,167
NA,Department of Immigration and Citizenship,167
NA,and the Refugee Review Tribunal. In a,167
NA,"recent editorial in the Australian, the member",167
NA,for Cook stated that the legislation runs the,167
NA,been risk of 'creating a further policy incentive for,167
NA,"people-smuggling', while the current",167
NA,discretionary system should be retained,167
NA,because it promotes what he called,167
NA,'flexibility'. This stands in stark contrast to,167
NA,"his predecessor as the member for Cook, the",167
NA,"Hon. Bruce Baird, who rightly said: 'This is",167
NA,not the way we should be treating the,167
NA,weakest and most vulnerable in our,167
NA,community.',167
NA,"The member for Cook, in his ongoing",167
NA,efforts to make political capital out of,167
NA,Australia's humanitarian and refugee,167
NA,"programs, has in the past managed to",167
NA,confuse visa subclasses and erroneously,167
NA,introduced a private member's bill that,167
NA,"accused the government, wrongly, of",167
NA,ignoring female applicants for the woman-at-,167
NA,risk visa. He argues that any amendment to,167
NA,our migration laws is a confession that 'push,167
NA,"factors' do not matter. By this logic, Labor's",167
NA,fiscal stimulus in 2008-09 must have been an,167
NA,admission that Australia caused the global,167
NA,financial crisis. It is a strange view indeed.,167
NA,"By blocking this bill, the opposition",168
NA,would be showing a callous attitude to,168
NA,"women fleeing domestic violence, physical",168
NA,abuse and sexual assault who come to,168
NA,Australia to seek refuge. Too often we hear,168
NA,deliberate inflammatory language from our,168
NA,"political opponents, rhetoric that is entirely",168
NA,divorced from reality. We must never forget,168
NA,that behind every statistic there is a human,168
NA,story. My grandparents lived in Victoria in,168
NA,Seaholme in a two-bedroom house with their,168
NA,four children. Their house was constructed,168
NA,"by my grandfather, who was a boilermaker",168
NA,"and not a carpenter, so there was always",168
NA,something that needed fixing around the,168
NA,home. Living by the seaside did not exactly,168
NA,help as the cold blustery winds were forever,168
NA,finding their way inside.,168
NA,"My mother tells the story of her father, my",168
NA,"grandfather, going down to the local tip to",168
NA,"get some more building materials, where he",168
NA,met an Egyptian migrant woman who had,168
NA,three children with her; she was just there at,168
NA,the tip. The woman said they did not have a,168
NA,"place to stay in, so my grandfather invited",168
NA,them back to his own home-a two-bedroom,168
NA,home that already housed six people. My,168
NA,"mother said that as a little girl, when she",168
NA,this new family of four coming into her,168
NA,"home, she wanted to cry as she was so angry",168
NA,"with her father. But her father said, 'Well,",168
NA,"they're not staying with us, they may not",168
NA,have a place to stay.' My mum told me how,168
NA,she was initially envious of the Egyptian,168
NA,"refugees, people who had less than her but",168
NA,"who, from her point of view, were 'taking",168
NA,things away' from her and the other kids in,168
NA,the family. All my mum could see was that,168
NA,"she lived in a rickety, cramped, cold house",168
NA,with hardly any possessions and these people,168
NA,who were staying the night were taking,168
NA,something away from her. But later she went,168
NA,on to see the need that the immigrant family,168
NA,had.,168
NA,Being able to see the big picture-to see,168
NA,"that refugees are not taking something but,",168
NA,"rather, are giving back to our community-is",168
NA,fundamental to the success of the Australian,168
NA,multicultural story. The great success of,168
NA,multiculturalism in Australia has been the,168
NA,"way that suburban Australians have, without",168
NA,"fuss, accepted successive waves of new",168
NA,migrants into our neighbourhoods. As a local,168
NA,"member of parliament, one of the things I",168
NA,most enjoy is to stand in a school,168
NA,assembly-amidst children from all,168
NA,ancestries in the world-and sing with them,168
NA,those terrific lines from the national anthem:,168
NA,'For those who've come across the,168
NA,seas/We've boundless plains to share'.,168
NA,Australia is a big country with a big heart.,168
NA,This bill reflects that fact. It harmonises our,168
NA,laws with our international responsibilities. It,168
NA,ensures we meet our moral obligations. It,168
NA,demonstrates that we in the Labor Party are,168
NA,committed to a humane and just approach to,168
NA,"migration, and that we are not prepared to let",168
NA,the opposition's tub-thumping and incendiary,168
NA,rhetoric stand in the way of long-overdue,168
NA,reform.,168
Mr ROBERT ,Fadden) (18:58):,168
NA,saw Cognisant of the time and cognisant of the,168
NA,"day, we seek to stand here to discuss the",168
NA,Migration Amendment (Complementary,168
NA,if Protection) Bill 2011-another change and,168
NA,another piecemeal approach to what is now,168
NA,universally derided as a debacle in protecting,168
NA,our borders. When Labor came to power in,168
NA,"November 2007, there was a handful of",168
NA,"people in detention. It is, of course, a great",168
NA,euphemism meaning a small number of,168
NA,"people but I mean literally a handful. In fact,",168
NA,there were four-just four-in detention. I,168
NA,"am led to believe that at the time, given a bill",168
NA,"of something like $100 million or less, the",168
NA,department-what is now DIAC-was,168
NA,saying that this was a large amount of money,168
NA,"in expenditure. Well, we found yesterday in",168
NA,the budget that the expenditure that the,169
NA,Labor government is now facing is $1.7,169
NA,billion. It is an interesting aside that,169
NA,"Australian families, some earning as little as",169
NA,"$45,000 a year, will have the family tax",169
NA,benefit supplement frozen for two years with,169
NA,"no indexation, therefore reducing it in real",169
NA,terms. Families will suffer to the tune of $2,169
NA,million in Australia whilst we spend $1.7,169
NA,billion in dealing with a boat person crisis,169
NA,"caused by, started by, enacted by and",169
NA,maintained by an inept Labor government,169
NA,and the changes they made in August 2008.,169
NA,It is quite clear to the Australian people that,169
NA,the unwinding of the Howard government,169
NA,framework that commenced in 2008 has,169
NA,"become a massive pull factor, a magnet that",169
NA,has drawn people smugglers to this country.,169

NA,ADJOURNMENT,169
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. Peter,169
NA,Slipper): Order! I propose the question:,169
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,169
NA,Paterson Electorate: Building the,169
NA,Education Revolution Program,169
Mr BALDWIN ,Paterson) (19:00): I rise,169
NA,today on behalf of small business tradesmen,169
NA,in my electorate of Paterson who have been,169
NA,failed by the Gillard Labor government.,169
NA,These workers are owed in excess of,169
NA,"$600,000 for work they completed in good",169
NA,faith under Labor's Building the Education,169
NA,"Revolution. Instead of helping them, Labor",169
NA,hung these businesses out to dry and then,169
NA,washed their hands of it. When Prime,169
NA,Minister Rudd announced a $16.2 billion,169
NA,program to build infrastructure in our,169
NA,schools he said it was to boost the economy.,169
NA,The government's website says that the BER,169
NA,will 'support local jobs and stimulate,169
NA,investment'.,169
NA,In my electorate of Paterson a group of 56,169
NA,small businesses were subcontracted to build,169
NA,a school hall COLA facility at the Pacific,169
NA,"Palms Public School. Unlike many others,",169
NA,these small businesses completed the job,169
NA,"with distinction. They brought the supplies,",169
NA,they put in the hours and they finished the,169
NA,hall in August 2010. It is now six months,169
NA,later and they are still waiting for their,169
NA,payment. There are also subcontractors owed,169
NA,money for BER projects at Bungwahl Public,169
NA,School in my electorate and at Coopernook,169
NA,Public School in the member for Lyne's,169
NA,electorate. How on earth has this been,169
NA,allowed to happen?,169
NA,The company that subcontracted my,169
NA,"constituents, Cape View Developments, has",169
NA,gone into liquidation. It failed to pay its,169
NA,subcontractors. The company that contracted,169
NA,"Cape View Developments, Reed",169
NA,"Constructions, failed to pay the",169
NA,subcontractors despite giving guarantees to,169
NA,the subcontractors they would once the work,169
NA,was completed. Neither the former state,169
NA,Labor Keneally government nor the current,169
NA,Gillard Labor government bothered to ensure,169
NA,the debt was settled.,169
NA,The buck must stop with the Prime,169
NA,"Minister, who, as the former education",169
NA,"minister, is responsible for the BER",169
NA,program. But our Prime Minister Gillard,169
NA,wants all of the gain and none of the pain.,169
NA,"When it came to spruiking her program,",169
NA,Prime Minister Gillard was happy to send,169
NA,Senator Forshaw to my electorate to open the,169
NA,building work at Pacific Palms Public School,169
NA,"and to speak to the media, but when it comes",169
NA,to ensuring those who did the work in good,169
NA,"faith get paid for it, neither she nor Senator",169
NA,Forshaw was anywhere to be seen. Prime,169
NA,Minister Gillard has left those businesses and,169
NA,families under severe financial stress. She,169
NA,"should be ashamed. For example, Carl Organ",169
NA,"is a local plumber who signed a contract,",169
NA,bought supplies and completed the job. He is,169
NA,"now owed more than $45,000. That is a",169
NA,massive amount of money for a small,169
NA,business and a family that is trying to make a,170
NA,living and put their kids through school.,170
NA,There are many other questions that are,170
NA,yet to be answered-questions such as: did,170
NA,Cape View sign a declaration of payment to,170
NA,a subcontractor under the Building and,170
NA,Construction Industry Security of Payment,170
NA,Act stating to Reed that it had paid its,170
NA,"subbies in order to get paid itself? If so, it",170
NA,could be in breach of the law. I have put the,170
NA,question to Reed Constructions but they,170
NA,would not answer my questions. Even the,170
NA,subcontractors themselves have been largely,170
NA,"shut out by Reed, which seems to have gone",170
NA,"to ground on the issue. Put simply, no-one",170
NA,wants to take responsibility for the BER,170
NA,program when things go wrong. Prime,170
NA,Minister Gillard has handed out billions of,170
NA,taxpayers' dollars but failed to put into place,170
NA,any mechanisms for accountability. So it is,170
NA,up to her to settle this matter.,170
NA,I wrote to the Minister for Tertiary,170

NA,"Relations, Chris Evans, regarding this issue",170
NA,back on 3 March and he has not bothered to,170
NA,reply. Yet they continue to send Senator,170
NA,Forshaw to open school buildings in my,170
NA,electorate. Likewise the member for Lyne,170
NA,also had the chance to stand up for these,170
NA,"workers, many of whom are his constituents,",170
NA,but he would not do anything for them.,170
NA,"Sadly, I am not surprised, because he had a",170
NA,chance to vote with the coalition to approve,170
NA,an inquiry into the BER but he would not. I,170
NA,think he is more interested in his own job,170
NA,than he is interested in standing up for his,170
NA,own constituents. The small businesses who,170
NA,are already struggling because of these debts,170
NA,will now have to pay for lawyers to take this,170
NA,up in court on their behalf. It would be yet,170
NA,another burden.,170
NA,Labor must do something to fix this now,170

NA,"Piccoli. Prime Minister, you are sending",170

NA,meet with the subbies who have not yet been,170
NA,"paid? Prime Minister, I am demanding that",170
NA,you take an active role and end this debt,170
NA,problem for people who placed good faith in,170

NA,Australian Mammal Extinction,170
NA,Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills),170
NA,"(19:05): Over the past 200 years, more",170
NA,mammal species have become extinct in,170
NA,Australia than anywhere on earth. Australian,170
NA,mammal extinctions account for about one-,170
NA,third of all mammals that have disappeared,170
NA,from the world over the past 500 years. Back,170
NA,"just 50 years, we would still find quolls",170
NA,around Melbourne and pig-footed,170
NA,"bandicoots, crescent nail-tail wallabies and",170
NA,desert rat-kangaroos in Central Australia.,170
NA,"Those animals have gone, in a time frame",170
NA,that in an evolutionary context is the blink of,170
NA,an eye.,170
NA,We assume that this is the fault of,170
NA,"previous generations, who did not know any",170
NA,"better, and that we now have a greater sense",170
NA,of environmental responsibility and that we,170
NA,now look after our unique animals. We have,170
NA,"environment protection legislation, we have",170
NA,more national parks and we know a lot more,170
NA,about the Australian ecology. We assume,170
NA,that future generations will commend our,170
NA,responsibility rather than condemn our,170
NA,neglect. We would be wrong. The decline,170
NA,"goes on as fast as ever, and we face the real",170
NA,likelihood of a new wave of mammal,170
NA,extinctions on our watch.,170
NA,I commend the Australian Wildlife,171
NA,"Conservancy, the Nature Conservancy, and",171
NA,the Pew Environment Group for drawing,171
NA,public attention to this ongoing crisis.,171
NA,drawn extensively on two of their reports-,171
NA,Into oblivion: the disappearing native,171
NA,mammals of northern Australia and The,171
NA,collapse of northern mammal populations-,171
NA,in preparing these remarks. Twenty years,171
NA,"ago, people camping in northern Australia",171
NA,were likely to witness bandicoots and quolls,171
NA,scampering around their campsite during the,171
NA,night. For native mammals this was a land of,171
NA,"plenty, one of the few remaining places with",171
NA,a fauna largely as it was at the time of,171
NA,European settlement. But three years ago a,171
NA,team of Australian Wildlife Conservancy,171
NA,ecologists was carrying out a fauna inventory,171
NA,survey of a property in the Northern,171
NA,Territory to assess its conservation value for,171
NA,possible acquisition. Over two weeks they,171
NA,set traps at a range of remote locations,171
NA,accessible only by helicopter. The survey,171
NA,sites were positioned in combinations of,171
NA,topography and vegetation that seemed,171
NA,guaranteed to deliver high diversities of,171
NA,various mammal species. But night after,171
NA,night the traps were empty. Amongst,171
NA,complex sandstone formations that should,171
NA,"have been thick with rock rats, and northern",171
NA,"quolls, the team found nothing, not even",171
NA,"tracks. In lush paperbark forests, the rich",171
NA,loamy soil should have been dotted with the,171
NA,characteristic potholes of digging bandicoots.,171
NA,The survey team saw and caught nothing.,171
NA,Long-tailed planigales were absent from the,171
NA,black-soil plains. Native rodents were absent,171
NA,from the savanna woodlands and the creek,171
NA,"banks. In over 1000 trap nights, the AWC",171
NA,caught only two species of small native,171
NA,"mammal, which they described as a truly",171
NA,demoralising experience.,171
NA,AWC says this survey experience is not,171
NA,unique. In the past 20 years there has been a,171
NA,catastrophic decline in the diversity and,171
NA,abundance of small mammals across,171
NA,northern Australia. From Cape York to the,171
NA,"Kimberley, small mammals are disappearing.",171
NA,I have A growing body of published and,171
NA,unpublished survey reports across the north,171
NA,provides compelling evidence of a dramatic,171
NA,collapse in mammal populations. What is,171
NA,causing this decline? The first culprit is fire.,171
NA,Prior to European settlement Aboriginal,171
NA,people generally lit fires with care and a,171
NA,close appreciation of environmental,171
NA,conditions. They were typically of low,171
NA,"intensity and small in scale, producing an",171
NA,"intricate landscape tapestry, a fine mosaic of",171
NA,burnt and unburnt areas. But the regime of,171
NA,fire is now very different. Across much of,171
NA,the land fires are now more extensive and,171
NA,burn with greater intensity and frequency.,171
NA,"For example, many national parks and",171
NA,Aboriginal lands now are at least 50 per cent,171
NA,burnt every year. The native mammals of,171
NA,northern Australia are highly susceptible to,171
NA,"fire, and the frequent, intense and large-scale",171
NA,fires are driving declines. I urge northern,171
NA,Australian land managers to reduce the scale,171
NA,and intensity of fires so that burnt patches,171
NA,are on a scale of hectares rather than,171
NA,hundreds of square kilometres. The size and,171
NA,intensity of fire needs to be reduced so that,171
NA,fires occur in fine-scale mosaics.,171
NA,There also needs to be a big effort to,171
NA,effectively control introduced predators and,171
NA,pests such as cats and cane toads. Feral cats,171
NA,need to be effectively controlled through,171
NA,intensive management such as targeted,171
NA,baiting. Our native mammal species are part,171
NA,of Australia's rich heritage. They have an,171
NA,intrinsic value and the right to exist. It is a,171
NA,"mark of our character as a nation, and we",171
NA,will be judged by future generations on the,171
NA,way we value and cherish this unique and,171
NA,irreplaceable heritage.,171
NA,Budget,172
Mr BRIGGS ,Mayo) (19:10): It is a,172
NA,pleasure to rise tonight to talk in the,172
NA,adjournment debate about the topic of the,172
NA,"day, and that is the big spending, high taxing",172
NA,"Labor budget. Last night, the Treasurer said",172
NA,"this was a Labor budget, and not a truer word",172
NA,has been said. He was right. This is a very,172
NA,"Labor budget: a massive budget deficit,",172
NA,"soaring to $50 billion this financial year,",172
NA,billion in the bill we will have to vote on in,172
NA,"this House, and a blow-out from the",172
NA,projections in MYEFO of $9.6 billion. Net,172
NA,"debt is peaking at over $100 billion, a",172
NA,"shameful record for this Treasurer to have,",172
NA,and remaining above $100 billion in the,172
NA,forward estimates. This amounts to a bill for,172
NA,"every single Australian of $4,700. Interest",172
NA,repayments are $5.5 billion in 2011-12 and,172
NA,"climbing to $7.5 billion in 2014-15, or",172
NA,around $20 million a day. Labor is now,172
NA,borrowing $135 million a day to fund its,172
NA,reckless spending. As Alan Kohler said last,172
NA,night after the budget was handed down-an,172
NA,economist the Treasurer did not quote,172
NA,today-'Any decent CFO would be,172
NA,"embarrassed by this budget.' Of course, the",172
NA,Treasurer takes the role of CFO in the,172
NA,government.,172
NA,This is definitely a Labor budget. How did,172
NA,we get here? The Labor Party will blame all,172
NA,sorts of other factors but they were handed a,172
NA,"$20 billion surplus, no net debt and money in",172
NA,the bank when they came to government in,172
NA,2007. The Treasurer uses every excuse to,172
NA,"justify these horrendous figures, why he has",172
NA,taken the budget from a position of $20,172
NA,billion strength to a position of over $100,172
NA,billion net debt and deficit. The main reason,172
NA,why the federal budget is producing such,172
NA,"ugly figures is the wasteful, reckless",172
NA,spending of this government. We heard from,172
NA,the member for Paterson earlier about one of,172
NA,those examples of the mismanagement of,172
NA,"this government, the failed programs and the",172
NA,bad policy decisions. Building the Education,172
NA,"Revolution, or the school halls debacle, was",172
NA,a $1.7 billion blow-out with up to $8 billion,172
NA,wasted. The home insulation disaster-$2.4,172
NA,billion wasted and mismanaged and homes,172
NA,being burnt down. The Solar Homes,172
NA,program-$850 million wasted. The Green,172
NA,"$22 Loans program, which became Green Start",172
NA,before being dumped altogether-$300,172
NA,million wasted. Tax bonus payments-$46,172
NA,"million wasted, with money being sent to",172
NA,"people overseas, criminals and people who",172
NA,had passed away. Grocery Choice-$8,172
NA,million spent on a website that delivered,172
NA,nothing and was eventually shut down. The,172
NA,2020 Summit-$2 million wasted on a great,172
NA,big talkfest. Labor has learnt nothing from its,172
NA,first term policy stuff-ups and budget blow-,172
NA,outs.,172
NA,"Even in the Treasurer's fourth budget, he",172
NA,continues to waste money. Since coming to,172
NA,"power, Labor has employed 24,000",172
NA,additional public servants. The government,172
NA,is asking the Australian people to tighten,172
NA,"their belts, but it is refusing to do the same",172
NA,itself. They say they are cutting $2 billion,172
NA,from family payments to bring the budget,172
NA,"back to surplus, but $1.75 billion of this",172
NA,money will disappear to pay for the boats,172
NA,failure thanks to Labor's failed border,172
NA,protection policies. We only need to look at,172
NA,these figures to see that Labor's failed border,172
NA,protection policies are now impacting on,172
NA,Australian family budgets. We see that in my,172
NA,electorate on a daily basis with the obscene,172
NA,waste associated with the Inverbrackie,172
NA,detention facility. The Treasurer is giving,172
NA,$10 million to the unions to build a new,172
NA,website. This is just more wasteful spending.,172
NA,While the government might claim that,172
NA,"savings in this budget are $22 billion, they",172
NA,will actually spend $19 billion of it. Out of,172
NA,"the $22 billion in savings, almost half is",173
NA,made up of levies imposed on ordinary,173
NA,Australians.,173
NA,Labor is addicted to spending. It lacks the,173
NA,"courage to make the tough decisions, and",173
NA,Australian families are now paying the price,173
NA,of Labor's waste and mismanagement and its,173
NA,failed policies and policy implementation.,173
NA,Instead of cutting waste and making the hard,173
NA,"decisions in this budget, Labor has stripped",173
NA,$2 billion from Australian families by,173
NA,freezing indexation of key family tax,173
NA,payments and income thresholds-as I,173
NA,"remarked earlier, all to pay for the failed",173
NA,boats policy. The government is hitting,173
NA,Australian families and the economy with,173
NA,more than $6 billion in new taxes and higher,173
NA,"charges. At the same time, electricity prices",173
NA,"are up by 51 per cent, grocery prices are up",173
NA,"by 14 per cent, education and health costs are",173
NA,up by 20 per cent and petrol prices are on,173
NA,"their way up and up. Families are being hit,",173
NA,taxes are being raised and services are being,173
NA,cut. This is a very Labor budget.,173
NA,Victoria: Cattle Grazing and Duck,173
NA,Hunting,173
Ms PARKE ,Fremantle) (19:15): In the,173
NA,"relatively short time it has been in power,",173
NA,Victorian coalition government has lost no,173
NA,time in opening up the environment for,173
NA,exploitation. It reintroduced cattle grazing,173
NA,into Victoria's National Heritage listed,173
NA,Alpine National Park under the guise of,173
NA,'scientific grazing' for the alleged purpose of,173
NA,seeing if cattle grazing could be a fire,173
NA,management tool. It also extended the season,173
NA,for recreational shooting of native waterbirds,173
NA,"to a 12-week period, with bag limits of up to",173
NA,"ten birds per day per person, meaning an",173
NA,individual could shoot up to 840 ducks per,173
NA,season. Both decisions were made in the face,173
NA,of overwhelming community opposition and,173
NA,contrary to the weight of scientific evidence.,173
NA,They also impact on areas of Commonwealth,173
NA,jurisdiction.,173
NA,"With regard to so-called scientific grazing,",173
NA,I note that the $50 million Victorian,173
NA,bushfires royal commission did not,173
NA,recommend it as a fuel reduction or fire,173
NA,"management tool, or for further research.",173
NA,According to the Ecological Society of,173
NA,"Australia, 'there is no scientific evidence to",173
NA,support the claim that grazing in alpine and,173
NA,subalpine zones plays any role in mitigating,173
NA,"the effects of wildfire', while on the other",173
NA,"hand, 'grazing by livestock in the subalpine",173
NA,and alpine zones represents a significant,173
NA,"threat to water, soil, nature conservation and",173
NA,biodiversity values'. In March the federal,173
NA,minister for the environment ordered the,173
NA,"removal of cattle from the national park, as",173
NA,the Victorian government had failed to seek,173
NA,the necessary federal approval. I understand,173
NA,"that the cattle were, accordingly, removed by",173
NA,"the 8 April deadline; however, the Victorian",173
NA,"minister for the environment, Ryan Smith,",173
NA,has recently claimed that the trial will,173
NA,continue. The Victorian National Parks,173
NA,Association has likened the project to 'a,173
NA,"domestic version of Japanese whaling, in that",173
NA,it uses the guise of science to justify what is,173
NA,the essentially a politically motivated decision,173
NA,that undermines the integrity of Australia's,173
NA,world-class system of national parks'. As the,173
NA,"VNPA has rightly said, 'It's a park not a",173
NA,paddock'.,173
NA,WA banned recreational duck hunting in,173
NA,"1990, New South Wales banned it in 1995",173
NA,and Queensland banned it in 2005. Surveys,173
NA,show that 87 per cent of Victorians support a,173
NA,ban on recreational duck shooting. Aerial,173
NA,surveys by respected scientist Professor,173
NA,Richard Kingsford have shown that,173
NA,waterbird numbers have fallen by 82 per cent,173
NA,"across eastern Australia in the past 25 years,",173
NA,yet the Baillieu government has seen fit to,173
NA,approve and expand this obscene activity this,173
NA,year. The Victorian Department of,173
NA,Sustainability and Environment's website,174
NA,even trumpeted the news with a headline that,174
NA,I am sure they imagined was funny: 'Duck!,174
NA,It's hunting season.' An editorial in the Age,174
NA,in January this year entitled 'State takes two,174
NA,steps back on conservation' comments:,174
NA,... hunting flocks of wildfowl with a shotgun is,174
NA,unavoidably cruel and rare species are killed.,174
NA,"Studies show that for every duck retrieved, a",174
NA,"wounded bird flies off, often",174
NA,death.,174
NA,"Dr Graeme Hamilton, CEO of Birds",174
NA,"Australia, has said:",174
NA,The level of mortality and wounding of these,174
NA,native birds for the amusement of a handful of,174
NA,shooters cannot be justified in a modern society.,174
NA,"Young, inexperienced ducks will bear the brunt of",174
NA,"the onslaught, which could be disastrous for the",174
NA,overall waterfowl population for years to come ...,174
NA,Our wildlife should not be sacrificed for political,174
NA,purposes. Victoria's Recreational Duck Shooting,174
NA,Season should be abandoned once and for all.,174
NA,The campaign director of the Coalition,174
NA,"Against Duck Shooting, Laurie Levy, has",174
NA,noted:,174
NA,... the Commonwealth is a signatory to the,174
NA,international RAMSAR Treaty giving it direct,174
NA,responsibility for significant areas of Australia‘s,174
NA,"wetlands known as RAMSAR Sites, being",174
NA,"‗Wetlands of International Importance, especially",174
NA,as Waterfowl Habitat‘.,174
NA,Given community concern over the ethics of duck,174
NA,"shooting, combined with declining bird numbers,",174
NA,diminishing wetlands from drought and climate,174
NA,"change, as well as inconsistent policies of the",174
NA,"States/Territory governments on duck shooting,",174
NA,there is an urgent need for the Federal,174
NA,government to develop a national approach to the,174
NA,issue.,174
NA,"In 2008 136 organisations, including the",174
NA,"WWF, Birds Australia, Animals Australia,",174
NA,"RSPCA Australia, Voiceless, the Australian",174
NA,"Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness",174
NA,Society and Bird Observation and,174
NA,"Conservation Australia, issued a joint",174
NA,common position statement highlighting the,174
NA,unsustainable and cruel nature of the,174
NA,recreational shooting of native waterbirds,174
NA,"and calling for, inter alia, a permanent ban",174
NA,on recreational duck shooting on,174
NA,Commonwealth controlled land and on all,174
NA,Ramsar sites throughout Australia. This is a,174
NA,"matter firmly within federal jurisdiction, and",174
NA,I will certainly be advocating for it to be,174
NA,suffering a lingering implemented.,174
NA,"Finally, I would like to quote from an",174
NA,email to Premier Baillieu from a concerned,174
NA,"Australian, Nathan Cooper, who eloquently",174
NA,puts the case for an end to recreational duck,174
NA,hunting. He says:,174
NA,I believe society has transcended hunting as a,174
NA,sport and the great majority support measures of,174
NA,conservation and animal protection over cruel,174
NA,sport. While many rural Australians like myself,174
NA,allocate resources to improving biodiversity for,174
NA,"wildlife on our properties, it is disappointing to",174
NA,see outdated political decisions working in,174
NA,antithesis to these efforts.,174
NA,Employment,174
Mr CIOBO ,Moncrieff) (19:20): There,174
NA,is nothing more fundamental in terms of the,174
NA,core responsibilities of government than to,174
NA,provide an economic environment that,174
NA,fosters growth. There is nothing more,174
NA,fundamental that flows from an economic,174
NA,environment that fosters growth than the,174
NA,ability for someone to secure a job. In my,174
NA,"city, the Gold Coast, Australia's sixth largest",174
NA,"city, we have seen now the compounding",174
NA,consequences of Labor's stubborn refusal to,174
NA,adopt policy that is in Australia's economic,174
NA,interests and in the interests of my,174
NA,"constituents on the Gold Coast, who are now",174
NA,"facing the ravages of bad policy decisions,",174
NA,which are driving up unemployment. It has,174
NA,not always been this way on the Gold Coast.,174
NA,Traditionally this services based city has,174
NA,enjoyed levels of unemployment much lower,174
NA,than they are today. Historically the Gold,174
NA,Coast has had above national average levels,175
NA,of unemployment. But the previous coalition,175
NA,government recognised that there were,175
NA,"policy decisions that could be taken, and,",175
NA,"importantly, we took them, to empower",175
NA,"small business owners, for example, to take",175
NA,"the risk of putting on new staff, knowing full",175
NA,well that they would have the flexibility to,175
NA,make decisions about the consequences of,175
NA,that employment. These were the kinds of,175
NA,policies that drove unemployment down in a,175
NA,small business city like the Gold Coast.,175
NA,"As a direct result of coalition policies,",175
NA,Australia's sixth largest city,175
NA,unemployment rate went from historically,175
NA,sitting above the national average to reaching,175
NA,a low in January 2008 of 2.3 per cent. There,175
NA,can be no doubt that that was a direct,175
NA,consequence of a number of the coalition's,175
NA,policies and the management of the,175
NA,Australian economy that the coalition had,175
NA,fostered for the 13 or so years previously.,175
NA,"In four short years, we have seen the",175
NA,consequences of Labor's economic,175
NA,recklessness with respect to the job prospects,175
NA,of so many of my constituents. We have seen,175
NA,the consequences of Labor's bungled bank,175
NA,guarantee. We have seen it drive away non-,175
NA,bank lenders and drive many of them to the,175
NA,"wall, so that non-bank lenders, which",175
NA,historically accounted for over 10 per cent of,175
NA,"the lending market, now account for",175
NA,something like two per cent of the lending,175
NA,market. This source of capital was crucial for,175
NA,the development industry in my city of the,175
NA,Gold Coast and provided a massive amount,175
NA,of employment for local Gold Coasters.,175
NA,"We have seen, in addition to that, the",175
NA,consequences of Labor's debt and deficit.,175
NA,"Incidentally, in the budget handed down just",175
NA,"last night, net debt reached a record $106",175
NA,billion and we saw the budget deficit blow,175
NA,out to nearly $50 billion for this financial,175
NA,"year, expected to be $22 billion in the",175
NA,subsequent financial year. These levels of,175
NA,debt and deficit are forcing up interest rates.,175
NA,"So the bungled bank deposits guarantee,",175
NA,coupled with debt and deficit from the Labor,175
NA,"Party forcing up interest rates, have killed off",175
NA,the construction industry.,175
NA,Another consequence has been the rapid,175
NA,appreciation of the Australian dollar. The,175
NA,Australian dollar is rapidly appreciating as a,175
NA,consequence of expectations about interest,175
NA,rates in this country. And interest rates are,175
NA,going up in this country because the,175
NA,in government is spending like a drunken,175
NA,the sailor. Because the Australian dollar is,175
NA,"appreciating rapidly, we now have a situation",175
NA,where international tourists are finding,175
NA,"Australia too expensive to visit, and",175
NA,domestic tourists are finding it advantageous,175
NA,to travel abroad.,175
NA,The Gold Coast is now seeing more,175
NA,tourists travelling overseas than there are,175
NA,international tourists coming to Australia.,175
NA,And tourism is the single largest employer of,175
NA,local Gold Coasters. The simple reality is,175
NA,"that now, when the Gold Coast has nearly",175
NA,double the national average of,175
NA,"unemployment, at eight per cent, there are",175
NA,some important policy changes that need to,175
NA,happen for the Labor government to bring,175
NA,down the unemployment rate. There is,175
NA,assistance that should flow from Labor to,175
NA,help the Gold Coast in its hour of need.,175
NA,"Instead of assisting, they have turned their",175
NA,back on the city.,175
NA,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,175
Mr LYONS ,Bass) (19:26): I rise to,175
NA,bring the House's attention to the seriousness,175
NA,"of chronic fatigue syndrome, commonly",175
NA,"known as CFS, in Australia. As many of you",175
NA,"would be aware, this week is ME/CFS",175
NA,Awareness Week. It is estimated by ME/CFS,175
NA,"Australia that approximately 180,000",175
NA,Australians suffer from this severe,175
NA,"neurological disease, often referred to as the",175
NA,'invisible disease' as so many people that are,176
NA,suffering go unnoticed.,176
NA,Many Australians are unaware of the,176
NA,suffering that those with CFS endure.,176
NA,Symptoms include fatigue; post-exertional,176
NA,malaise; pain; dysfunctional,176
NA,"neurological and cognitive manifestations,",176
NA,including issues with short-term memory and,176
NA,concentration; autonomic manifestations;,176
NA,and immune system and neuroendocrine,176
NA,manifestations. And this suffering is not for,176
NA,short time. This is a serious illness-some,176
NA,"people are housebound, some are bed bound",176
NA,"and some, sadly, never recover. A study",176
NA,described CFS this way:,176
NA,… the patient's activity level is reduced by,176
NA,approximately 50% or more … ME/CFS is,176
NA,"""actually more debilitating than most other",176
NA,"medical problems in the world"" …",176
NA,Yet there is very little support for those,176
NA,suffering.,176
NA,It is not just the physical symptoms that,176
NA,affect sufferers. Looking after someone who,176
NA,has fallen victim to this illness is a heart-,176
NA,"wrenching job, and this can lead to family",176
NA,and social breakdown. There is also the cost,176
NA,"of doctors appointments, ongoing tests and",176
NA,seeking a treatment that might help even a,176
NA,little to ease the pain and discomfort,176
NA,associated with the illness. A study by the,176
NA,Australasian College of Physicians found,176
NA,that in 2000-01 the annual aggregate cost,176
NA,"totalled $13,471 per patient. Although this",176
NA,"figure is from some time ago, it demonstrates",176
NA,the high cost of this illness.,176
NA,Many younger people cannot complete,176
NA,their high school or college years or are too,176
NA,"unwell to attend university, which has",176
NA,implications for their long-term employment,176
NA,prospects. Adult sufferers often miss large,176
NA,amounts of work or are unable to resume,176
NA,their careers at the level they were once at.,176
NA,This illness is so multifaceted and it affects,176
NA,"not only the sufferer but also their carers,",176
NA,family and all of those close to them.,176
NA,I think that it is particularly difficult for,176
NA,younger sufferers. Often their peers do not,176
NA,"realise the magnitude of the illness, and it is",176
NA,sleep; easy for them to say that the person is putting,176
NA,it on or seeking attention by saying they are,176
NA,sick. It is not like this at all. This is a time in,176
NA,the sufferer's life when they need all the,176
NA,"support they can get, but so many",176
NA,a Australians just do not realise exactly what,176
NA,this illness means to someone who has it.,176
NA,The reason I am speaking about CFS tonight,176
NA,is that I want to raise awareness of what this,176
NA,illness is-the magnitude of the illness and,176
NA,what it is like to be a sufferer. Treatment for,176
NA,this illness is not simple-it is not simply,176
NA,taking medication to alleviate symptoms. It,176
NA,is a complex illness which affects sufferers,176
NA,"differently, but all need treatment, support",176
NA,and recognition of what they are going,176
NA,through. I want to raise awareness of it so,176
NA,that we can work together to provide support,176
NA,for these sufferers. It is important that we,176
NA,provide support for the organisations that so,176
NA,need funding and the resources these people,176
NA,need to fight this debilitating illness.,176
NA,Finally and importantly I urge everyone in,176
NA,this place to be involved in ME/CFS,176
NA,Awareness Week and to wear a ribbon,176
NA,tomorrow. This is a way of showing our,176
NA,support and recognising the suffering that,176
NA,"this terrible, debilitating illness inflicts.",176
NA,Budget,176
Mr BILSON ,Dunkley) (19:30): This,176
NA,federal Labor budget is a disappointment for,176
NA,most and a disaster for many small,176
NA,businesses and family enterprises. The,176
NA,Gillard Labor government has short-changed,176
NA,small businesses and family enterprises by,176
NA,delivering a budget that fails to address any,176
NA,of the key concerns and challenges currently,176
NA,faced by this engine room of the Australian,176
NA,"economy. Instead, the budget relies on tricks",177
NA,with smokes and mirrors to claim to be,177
NA,"helpful to small businesses, but those tricks",177
NA,are funded by measures that are actually,177
NA,harmful to smaller enterprises.,177
NA,The claimed cash flow benefit resulting,177
NA,"from the instant write-off of the first $5,000",177
NA,of a new work vehicle requires a small,177
NA,"business to spend nearly $34,000 dollars in",177
NA,cash to receive an extra tax benefit worth,177
NA,"around $1,275 in 2013, according to the",177
NA,example promoted by the Treasurer. This,177
NA,'spend a lot to benefit a little' measure does,177
NA,not actually start in this financial year nor,177
NA,"the next; it starts in 2012-13, with a payment",177
NA,possibly arriving in late 2013. It risks,177
NA,delaying vehicle sales and also comes at the,177
NA,"expense of over 400,000 of Australia's",177
NA,smallest businesses and self-employed,177
NA,"enterprises which are set to lose up to $2,500",177
NA,by the scrapping of the entrepreneurs tax,177
NA,"offset. Changes to vehicle fringe benefits tax,",177
NA,particularly punishing for rural and regional,177
NA,"communities, will be leaving small",177
NA,businesses with an additional potential,177
NA,"burden of up to $3,000 for providing",177
NA,"employees with vehicles, vans or delivery",177
NA,cars of some description-the result of,177
NA,caving in to the Greens' demands to change,177
NA,FBT.,177
NA,The Gillard government has given with,177
NA,one hand and taken with the other while,177
NA,ignoring the big challenges the small,177
NA,business community was desperate for the,177
NA,"government to address. In fact, those",177
NA,challenges have been made worse by this,177
NA,budget. The punishing impact on small,177
NA,business viability and its capacity to employ,177
NA,has been worsened by Labor's flawed carbon,177
NA,"dioxide tax. The tax itself, and any detail",177
NA,"about it, has been completely left out of the",177
NA,"budget, yet this is a real and compelling issue",177
NA,for the small business community.,177
NA,Difficulties accessing affordable credit have,177
NA,also been made worse by a budget which,177
NA,puts upward pressure on interest rates and by,177
NA,Commonwealth borrowings of $135 million,177
NA,a day crowding out small businesses seeking,177
NA,finance. Burgeoning red tape burdens are,177
NA,made worse with new disincentives and,177
NA,punishing reporting requirements for,177
NA,independent contracting and new compliance,177
NA,complexities for employer supplied,177
NA,vehicles-a couple of key areas.,177
NA,What is it about this government that so,177
NA,leads them to simply hate small business?,177
NA,The government will pocket $365 million,177
NA,from axing an important incentive for the,177
NA,"in microbusiness community, a tax incentive I",177
NA,"touched on earlier, which shows the disdain",177
NA,Labor has for those wishing to pursue their,177
NA,own employment trajectory and livelihoods,177
NA,without being in the traditional employer-,177
NA,employee relationship. The budget scraps the,177
NA,"enterprise tax offset. Self-employed people,",177
NA,"home based businesses, small retailers,",177
NA,service providers and people using their own,177
NA,"wit and entrepreneurship to enter, re-enter,",177
NA,participate in or defer retiring from the,177
NA,workforce will be rewarded by a new tax hit,177
NA,through the scrapping of the ETO.,177
NA,You hear the Prime Minister talk about,177
NA,the dignity of work and the government's,177
NA,effort of 'insisting on participation of more,177
NA,"workers', yet this government has that",177
NA,unionist view that only employees are,177
NA,"workers, that if you happen to be self-",177
NA,"employed, that if you are actually receiving",177
NA,payment for your services or your work or,177
NA,"revenue in your business, that does not",177
NA,count. It is only if you are receiving a pay,177
NA,cheque as an employee that it counts.,177
NA,Through that attitude and the decisions in,177
NA,"this budget, an avenue that sees millions of",177
NA,Australians able to support themselves and,177
NA,pursue a livelihood is being made more,177
NA,difficult.,177
NA,"In another area, the Assistant Treasurer",177
NA,Bill Shorten has broken an explicit promise,177
NA,not to make it more difficult for those,178
NA,involved in independent contracting and,178
NA,"employment. He promised, in an article in",178
NA,the Australian Financial Review on 13,178
NA,"October, that he would 'not make life",178
NA,"difficult for self-employed working people',",178
NA,yet what the budget announces is another,178
NA,instalment in this Gillard Labor government's,178
NA,concerted and coordinated campaign to,178
NA,hound and harass small-business people out,178
NA,of legitimate contracting arrangements and,178
NA,force them into employee-employer,178
NA,relationships that facilitate union,178
NA,intervention and control. There are two,178
NA,million Australians who derive their,178
NA,livelihood from self-employment and,178
NA,independent contracting. Bill Shorten,178
NA,assured them that he would not make their,178
NA,lives more difficult. He has. He stands,178
NA,condemned. This is yet another example of,178
NA,why only the coalition can support the small,178
NA,business community in Australia. (Time,178
NA,expired),178
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. Peter,178
NA,Slipper): I would remind the honourable,178
NA,member that he ought to refer to other,178
NA,honourable members by their title and not by,178
NA,their actual name.,178
NA,Braddon Electorate,178
Mr SIDEBOTTOM ,Braddon) (19:36):,178
NA,"Since 2007, the Labor government has been",178
NA,"highly supportive of, and has invested",178
NA,"heavily in, my region. The budget last night",178
NA,continued to support my region and I thank,178
NA,this government very much. I would like to,178
NA,mention at least five really good activities,178
NA,and programs that I have been able to share,178
NA,with my community recently. The first is the,178
NA,Mersey Bluff development-I,178
NA,"representing Simon Crean, who was the",178
NA,architect of the Better Regions Program.,178
NA,That program provided $1 million in funding,178
NA,"for the Devonport Surf Club, part of a $7",178
NA,million recreation and wellbeing precinct in,178
NA,selfDevonport. I want to congratulate the,178
NA,"government and the Devonport council, in",178
NA,"particular its mayor, for the tremendous",178
NA,investment in what is one of the most,178
NA,beautiful parts of not just the north-west,178
NA,coast but indeed Australia.,178
NA,The second enterprise I would like to,178
NA,mention is what we call the Community,178
NA,Infrastructure Development Group in my,178
NA,region. Through the jobs fund and more,178
NA,specifically the Get Communities Working,178
NA,"project, $900,000 or a little over was",178
NA,allocated to the O Group to create a program,178
NA,using construction supervisors and a number,178
NA,of apprentices and trade experienced and,178
NA,unemployed people who worked on a whole,178
NA,"range of projects for the last 12 months, in",178
NA,particular the Picton Grange building at the,178
NA,Latrobe Sport and Recreation Centre.,178
NA,"Representing Minister Ellis, the Minister for",178
NA,"Employment Participation and Childcare, I",178
NA,was able to congratulate the Latrobe City,178
NA,"Council staff, members of the Latrobe Sport",178
NA,and Recreation Centre management,178
NA,committee and the O Group on what is a,178
NA,"fantastic community facility, a gymnasium",178
NA,which will be available to that community.,178
NA,A third area of investment by this,178
NA,"government-indeed, I was able to do this",178
NA,with the Minister for Home Affairs and,178
NA,"Minister for Justice, Brendan O'Connor-",178
NA,"was the allocation of $250,000 to, again, the",178
NA,Devonport City Council for the setting up of,178
NA,CCTV cameras as part of the community,178
NA,"safety program. Again, I congratulate the",178
NA,"council, the local community and the local",178
NA,police representatives on getting funding for,178
NA,was the CCTV cameras in order to enhance even,178
NA,further the liveability and amenity of the,178
NA,beautiful city of Devonport.,178
NA,"A fourth area I was able to take part in,",178
NA,"and very proudly so, is one of the few",178
NA,projects throughout Australia at the moment,179
NA,launching the local connections to work at,179
NA,"Burnie, particularly the Centrelink area. This",179
NA,is a unique service bringing together all the,179
NA,services helping long-term unemployed and,179
NA,youth who are facing barriers to social,179
NA,inclusion and economic participation. So,179
NA,"under the one roof, you have employment",179
NA,services through Job Services Australia and,179
NA,disability employment service providers and,179
NA,"services to help people with carer needs,",179
NA,"housing, advocacy, legal issues, mental",179
NA,health needs and youth services including,179
NA,"educational services, as well as working with",179
NA,Medicare in order to allow for electronic,179
NA,"funds transfers, trying to get people into a",179
NA,'tell it once' wraparound service surrounding,179
NA,customers with assistance. I want to,179
NA,congratulate Centrelink at Burnie for the,179
NA,fantastic job they do.,179
NA,"Finally, there are two fantastic social",179
NA,"housing initiatives. On 28 April, I was in",179
NA,Ulverstone at Grove Street where we had,179
NA,supported accommodation of some 20-unit,179
NA,complexes put together by the Tasmanian,179
NA,"government through their housing fund, an",179
NA,additional six units costing $1.65 million by,179
NA,the Commonwealth and finally the Optia,179
NA,"units in Mussen Court, Burnie, 20 one-",179
NA,bedroom units designed for persons living,179
NA,with a disability at a cost of $3.3 million,179
NA,"with Optia providing $700,000 and the land",179
NA,provided by the Burnie City Council. (Time,179
NA,expired),179
NA,Hinkler Electorate,179
Mr NEVILLE ,Hinkler-The Nationals,179
NA,Deputy Whip) (19:41): In recent months the,179
NA,local economies of Hervey Bay and,179
NA,Bundaberg have taken sustained and,179
NA,consecutive blows with the closure of key,179
NA,businesses. Regional economies are doing it,179
NA,tougher than ever because when businesses,179
NA,and banks reduce their exposure and,179
NA,"consolidate their operations, private",179
NA,investment dries up and local jobs disappear.,179
NA,"In Bundaberg alone, hundreds of jobs",179
NA,have disappeared since the beginning of the,179
NA,year with the closure of a Salmat call centre,179
NA,"which was subcontracted to Telstra, APN's",179
NA,decision to close its printing works in,179
NA,"Bundaberg, the failure of two local builders",179
NA,"and the collapse of Barbera Farms, one of",179
NA,Australia's biggest producers of tomatoes and,179
NA,zucchinis and certainly one of Australia's,179
NA,biggest producers of capsicums. The APN,179
NA,and Barbera Farms situations have also,179
NA,impacted on the electorate of my colleague,179
NA,the member for Dawson in the Mackay-,179
NA,"Bowen area. If these were not enough, the",179
NA,recent floods added yet another dimension of,179
NA,challenge to our community.,179
NA,It is time the government recognised that,179
NA,regional areas are doing it really tough. They,179
NA,deserve their fair share of the economic cake,179
NA,"as well. Typically, the government blew the",179
NA,opportunity to give back to regional,179
NA,communities in this year's budget.,179
NA,'Productivity' seems to be the government's,179
NA,catchcry-yet there has been no recognition,179
NA,that Queensland's productivity is driven by,179
NA,its rail and road systems.,179
NA,The systemic failure of transport was,179
NA,roundly sheeted home to the condition of the,179
NA,Bruce Highway during the recent flood.,179
NA,There were sections of the Bruce Highway,179
NA,closed all the way from the Sunshine Coast,179
NA,to Cairns and at times cities the size of,179
NA,Gympie and Maryborough were closed off.,179
NA,Not one new dollar has been invested in the,179
NA,Bruce Highway. The minister has announced,179
NA,old funding and reinstated funding that was,179
NA,"deferred from earlier this year, but has failed",179
NA,to invest any new funding for Queensland's,179
NA,"key highway network. For example, it",179
NA,reinstated what is known as the rollercoaster,179
NA,north of Gin Gin and it announced the Isis,179
NA,"River bridge, which is under construction as",179
NA,"we speak. In fact, the minister has removed",180
NA,funding from the notorious Cooroy to Curra,180
NA,"section of the Bruce Highway, where",180
NA,honourable members would be surprised to,180
NA,know that traffic has to travel at 90,180
NA,kilometres per hour for nearly 38 kilometres.,180
NA,On page 270 of budget paper 2 there is a,180
NA,report that $325.4 million will be stripped,180
NA,from the Ipswich Motorway and the Cooroy,180
NA,"to Curra section of the Bruce Highway,",180
NA,"section B, because the 'the funding will not",180
NA,be required'-that is a joke. It is common,180
NA,knowledge that the section B project is,180
NA,"running under budget, but if spare money is",180
NA,now available surely the minister should,180
NA,have directed those funds towards starting,180
NA,construction of section A of the upgrade. It,180
NA,emblematic of a budget which has,180
NA,consistently robbed Peter to pay Paul.,180
NA,Let me give you yet another example on a,180
NA,"smaller scale, but a no less significant one",180
NA,my electorate. It is Labor's decision to pull,180
NA,$8 million of funding from the Veterans',180
NA,"Affairs portfolio, specifically the Veteran",180
NA,and Community grants program and the,180
NA,Building Excellence in Support and Training,180
NA,"program, whilst outlaying $8.2 million to",180
NA,advertise its carbon tax. It is a slap in the,180
NA,face to our veterans to pull funding from,180
NA,vital support programs while shovelling the,180
NA,"equivalent amount, if not more, into a self-",180
NA,promoting PR blitz for a tax that nobody,180
NA,wants and that this nation cannot afford.,180
NA,"Of course, the budget contained absolutely",180
NA,"no detail on the carbon tax, which leaves",180
NA,Australian families and businesses in the,180
NA,dark over just how much this tax will hurt,180
NA,them. What do we know about this tax other,180
NA,than it will be another crushing burden for,180
NA,Australians who are already struggling with,180
NA,a 51 per cent increase in the cost of,180
NA,"electricity, a 14 per cent increase in the cost",180
NA,of groceries and a 20 per cent increase in the,180
NA,costs of health and education? This year's,180
NA,budget was an opportunity to help regional,180
NA,"communities, to help families, and to help",180
NA,small and medium businesses. Labor has,180
NA,"squandered that chance. It is a disgrace, as is",180
NA,its budget.,180
NA,Queensland Floods,180
NA,Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (19:46): On 16,180
NA,January this year thousands of,180
NA,Queenslanders were returning to their homes,180
NA,"and businesses after the recent floods, often",180
NA,to find them completely destroyed. Many,180
NA,tragically lost whatever hope they had held,180
NA,"that maybe, just maybe, something had been",180
NA,"saved. But whilst these people were grieving,",180
NA,whilst we were comforting our friends and,180
NA,"is neighbours, and whilst local councils were",180
NA,kicking into gear and fronting up to the,180
NA,"mammoth clean-up task ahead, Senator Bob",180
NA,"Brown, a political leader in this country, was",180
NA,to in the media-safe in Tasmania and far away,180
NA,from the devastation-pushing his own,180
NA,"political agenda. Whilst people were, and",180
NA,"still are, left uncertain about what their lives",180
NA,"now hold, Senator Brown could only concern",180
NA,himself with the political point scoring that,180
NA,the floods offered. That was a despicable,180
NA,action not worthy of him or the position he,180
NA,holds.,180
NA,I believe passionately in the importance of,180
NA,full and frank debate concerning the issues,180
NA,confronting our nation. I have a genuine,180
NA,interest and concern as to the ongoing debate,180
NA,regarding our environment. But as important,180
NA,"as Senator Brown believes this debate to be,",180
NA,there is a time and a place for things to be,180
NA,said. There is a time and a place for things to,180
NA,be done. To seek to make political capital,180
NA,just as Queenslanders were confronting the,180
NA,devastating results of the floods was,180
NA,insensitive and uncaring because that was a,180
NA,time for things to be done-not for politics.,180
NA,That was a time for our leaders to lead and,180
NA,lend a hand-not for politics. That was a,181
NA,time when so many Australians dropped,181
NA,"what they were doing and asked, 'How can I",181
NA,help?',181
NA,If Senator Brown had joined that,181
NA,magnificent effort and had spoken to as,181
NA,"many flood victims as I did, I am sure he",181
NA,would have understood that the people of,181
NA,"Emerald, of Toowoomba, of the Lockyer, of",181
NA,Ipswich and of Brisbane needed support at,181
NA,that time and a generous hand of friendship.,181
NA,That is what we saw from so many others of,181
NA,different political persuasions. They did not,181
NA,shout their differences. They stood side by,181
NA,"side, not to debate or score points but simply",181
NA,to help. So many of them did their bit-often,181
NA,for complete strangers-but Senator Brown,181
NA,appears only to have seen political,181
NA,opportunity.,181
NA,I am concerned about Senator Brown's,181
NA,contribution to this debate because he,181
NA,appears so driven by an absolute conviction,181
NA,of his own infallibility and by an almost,181
NA,manic determination to ride over any,181
NA,"alternative view, no matter how reasonable it",181
NA,might be. This driven approach-that rules,181
NA,out debate and paints all those who dare,181
NA,question his extreme views as environmental,181
NA,vandals and deniers-no doubt led Senator,181
NA,Brown to play the politics of the disaster,181
NA,not deal with the tragic reality.,181
NA,Senator Brown knew that the parliament,181
NA,would meet within weeks but he could not,181
NA,wait. Before the leader of the Greens again,181
NA,uses others' adversity for political,181
NA,"opportunism, I simply ask that he considers",181
NA,those who have suffered and that not all,181
NA,"development is bad. Indeed, with careful",181
NA,consideration and proper environmental,181
NA,"safeguards, even dams have their place.",181
NA,When looking at the Brisbane and Ipswich,181
NA,"floods, Senator Brown should consider this:",181
NA,Wivenhoe Dam was built after the 1974,181
NA,"Brisbane floods for flood mitigation and, as",181
NA,"such, it was to be complemented by",181
NA,"Wolffdene Dam, which was to provide a safe",181
NA,and viable water supply for Brisbane and the,181
NA,south-east corner of Queensland. Although,181
NA,building the Wolffdene Dam would not have,181
NA,"changed rainfall patterns, it would have",181
NA,greatly decreased the pressure on Wivenhoe,181
NA,to provide water for a rapidly growing,181
NA,population and it would have planned for,181
NA,"Queensland's future. Without that pressure,",181
NA,Wivenhoe could have proved so much more,181
NA,effective in minimising the impact of the,181
NA,recent floods. The Wolffdene Dam was,181
NA,cancelled in 1989 by the Goss Labor,181
NA,"administration. Interestingly, Premier Goss'",181
NA,chief of staff at the time was the now,181
NA,member for Griffith. This year we reaped the,181
NA,consequences of that decision.,181
NA,So as Senator Brown drives the Australian,181
NA,government's implementation of his carbon,181
NA,"tax, let me say this: Senator Brown's",181
NA,comments are a timely reminder to us all that,181
NA,it is easy to seek out the 10-second media,181
NA,"grab, to make a speech and to fight the",181
NA,"political fight, but in so doing we should",181
NA,always remember that there are some times,181
NA,that must be above politics. There are some,181
NA,times when we must put aside the bludgeon,181
NA,"of politics and stand, even in this place,",181
NA,and shoulder to shoulder while doing what we,181
NA,can best do for our nation and for our people,181

NA,compassion and plain common sense.,181
NA,"D'Orazio, Mr John",181
NA,Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister,181
NA,for Defence and Deputy Leader of the,181
NA,House) (19:51): I rise this evening during,181
NA,the adjournment debate as the federal,181
NA,member for Perth to make some remarks,181
NA,"about the late John D'Orazio, a former Labor",181
NA,member of the Western Australian state,181
NA,"parliament. He died suddenly on Monday, 11",181
NA,April. John D'Orazio was a lifelong friend of,182
NA,mine and remained a friend until his death.,182
NA,"Fortunately from a personal perspective, I",182
NA,had the opportunity to have a good,182
NA,conversation with him by phone on the,182
NA,Friday before his death. He told me that that,182
NA,day was a good day. He was suffering from,182
NA,amyloidosis and he had his ups and downs.,182
NA,"As ever, when we spoke, we spoke about",182
NA,"politics, we spoke about his pharmacy",182
NA,business and we spoke about family.,182
NA,I have known John since we were both in,182
NA,grade 7. He lived in his beloved Bayswater,182
NA,and attended Christian Brothers College,182
NA,Bedford. I lived in Mount Lawley and,182
NA,attended Christian Brothers High School,182
NA,"Highgate. In those days, CBC Bedford only",182
NA,"went to junior, so for subleaving and leaving",182
NA,the Bedford boys came to Highgate. When,182
NA,"we finished school together, he went to what",182
NA,is now Curtin University and graduated as a,182
NA,"pharmacist, and opened his pharmacy in",182
NA,"Guildford Road, Bayswater. He subsequently",182
NA,became a councillor and mayor of the city of,182
NA,"Bayswater, a mayor of long standing. It was",182
NA,here that he made his mark and left a,182
NA,longstanding and great impression on the,182
NA,local area and the broader city of Bayswater,182
NA,community.,182
NA,It was a great personal and professional,182
NA,privilege in my early years as the federal,182
NA,member for Perth from 1993 to 2000 to work,182
NA,closely with him when he was mayor of the,182
NA,city of Bayswater. He retired as mayor in,182
NA,2000 and subsequently became a state,182
NA,member of parliament. His,182
NA,achievements as mayor included the,182
NA,development of the Galleria shopping centre,182
NA,in Morley and what is widely regarded as the,182
NA,best waste and recycle collection system for,182
NA,a local authority in Australia. He established,182
NA,the first citywide 24-hour security watch for,182
NA,a local authority in Australia. And he made,182
NA,sure his council became debt free. I was very,182
NA,pleased to be able to work closely with him,182
NA,to establish the first Bendigo Community,182
NA,"Bank in Western Australia, in Bayswater",182
NA,itself. I also worked very closely with him to,182
NA,protect the residents of the city of Bayswater,182
NA,from aircraft noise from the Perth airport.,182
NA,When he entered the state parliament in,182
NA,"2001, he had my very strong support for",182
NA,Labor Party preselection and my very strong,182
NA,support for his election to parliament. His,182
NA,preselection and his subsequent election was,182
NA,widely welcomed and broadly acclaimed. He,182
NA,"was a person regarded as a future minister,",182
NA,and he duly became a minister. Initially that,182
NA,"was a happy experience, but it was not",182
NA,without its difficulties. The political,182
NA,difficulty never justified the treatment he,182
NA,received at the Western Australian,182
NA,Corruption and Crime Commission in,182
NA,respect of which he was subsequently,182
NA,"exonerated, nor did it justify his peremptory",182
NA,expulsion from the state parliamentary Labor,182
NA,Party at the hands of the then Western,182
NA,"Australian Premier, Alan Carpenter. This",182
NA,action was both unjustified and unjustifiable,182
NA,on the part of the Premier and it was a,182
NA,mistake for which he would pay dearly. The,182
NA,"Premier, the Labor Party and the Labor",182
NA,government paid a heavy price for that,182
NA,"mistake when Labor, at a subsequent",182
NA,"election, lost the seat of Morley, thereby",182
NA,enabling a Barnett-led minority government,182
NA,to take the helm in Western Australia.,182
NA,I was honoured to be able to attend John's,182
NA,great requiem mass at St Columbus in Bayswater,182
NA,and to attend his service at the Karrakatta,182
NA,mausoleum. I was pleased to be able to,182
NA,"express my condolences to his son, Greg, his",182
NA,"daughter, Jessica, his wife, Ailsa, and his",182
NA,"first wife, Ros, whom I have known for",182
NA,many years. I again extend those,182
NA,condolences.,182
NA,His departure from public life was not a,183
NA,happy one. It was unfortunate. But he,183
NA,retained the respect of his community and,183
NA,"friends, of which I was proud to say I was",183
NA,one. His untimely and early death was a,183
NA,tragedy for his family. I again express my,183
NA,regards to his family and his broader family,183
NA,and his brothers. As we ended many,183
NA,"conversations since grade 7, I do so in the",183
NA,"same way tonight: arrivederci, paisan.",183
NA,Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life,183
NA,Saving,183
Mr CHESTER ,Gippsland) (19:56): I,183
NA,commend the minister for his tender farewell,183
NA,to a close colleague and friend. It is with,183
NA,great pleasure that I inform the House of the,183
NA,formation of the Parliamentary Friends of,183
NA,"Surf Life Saving, an organisation which had",183
NA,its first meeting this week under the,183
NA,"stewardship of our inaugural president, the",183
NA,member for Bass. The member for Bass is a,183
NA,man who has a great reputation in the surf,183
NA,lifesaving movement in Australia and I,183
NA,understand he is a life member of Surf Life,183
NA,Saving Australia. As I have remarked once,183
NA,"in the past, it is not something that you",183
NA,on the back of a cornflakes packet; you have,183
NA,to serve. I believe the member for Bass has,183
NA,served with great distinction in the surf,183
NA,lifesaving movement.,183
NA,It is a great occasion for the House to,183
NA,establish such a parliamentary friends,183
NA,"organisation, when you understand that the",183
NA,surf lifesaving movement is such an integral,183
NA,part of the Australian community. There are,183
NA,"more than 150,000 surf lifesaving volunteers",183
NA,across the nation and more than 300 clubs.,183
NA,When you talk about surf lifesaving,183
NA,"members, it is not a male domain; it is very",183
NA,much a community organisation with strong,183
NA,representation from female athletes and,183
NA,female volunteers who serve on our beaches.,183
NA,It also has the great distinction of being a,183
NA,community and charitable organisation,183
NA,which develops young people from a very,183
NA,"early age at, say, seven or eight years old as",183
NA,his nippers and they continue their involvement,183
NA,right through to masters carnivals. It is one,183
NA,of those few organisations in the community,183
NA,which is continuing to grow-as I,183
NA,"understand, at about two per cent per annum.",183
NA,It is a fantastic achievement for the surf,183
NA,lifesaving movement.,183
NA,Surf lifesavers in Australia do a fantastic,183
NA,job. They keep our beaches safe and I think,183
NA,we sometimes forget how important that is,183
NA,from a tourism and economic development,183
NA,perspective. Can you imagine the Gold Coast,183
NA,without patrolled beaches? Can you imagine,183
NA,"the beach in my own community, the 90-",183
NA,"mile beach, without patrols? The tourist",183
NA,industry would suffer enormously. It is,183
NA,magnificent that we have these people,183
NA,prepared to patrol as volunteers on a daily,183
NA,basis throughout summer to help keep our,183
NA,beaches safe.,183
NA,The red and yellow image of the surf,183
NA,lifesaving movement is an iconic Australian,183
NA,image and it is something that we have been,183
NA,get able to export to other nations. Our surf,183
NA,lifesavers through Surf Life Saving Australia,183
NA,have been prepared to engage in an,183
NA,international program to spread the word and,183
NA,help educate other nations who perhaps have,183
NA,not had the same level of surf safety that we,183
NA,have been able to enjoy in Australia.,183
NA,I congratulate those who have shown,183
NA,interest in the Parliamentary Friends of Surf,183
NA,Life Saving. I certainly congratulate Surf,183
NA,Life Saving Australia and all its state based,183
NA,"organisations, but most of all I congratulate",183
NA,the men and women and the young people,183
NA,who contribute their time and make such an,183
NA,extraordinary commitment to serve our,183
NA,nation. I wish them well over the winter,183
NA,months as they prepare for another busy,183
NA,"summer season ahead. Finally, I encourage",183
NA,other members to get involved in the,183
NA,Parliamentary Friends of Surf Life Saving,184
NA,"under the guardianship of our president, the",184
NA,member for Bass.,184

NA,July 2011. These are significant improvements,198
NA,parents around Australia.,198
NA,But $20 billion is a lot of money and it,198
NA,amendments in this bill give the Australian,198
NA,their past practices. It enables the Australian,198
NA,by one service from another service run by the,198
NA,possible. The Commonwealth has only been,198
NA,specific operator. This will ensure that operators,198
NA,one service can be held accountable for their,198
NA,an operator accumulates debts and then exits,198
NA,government will be able to pursue,198
NA,We know these accountability reforms are,198

NA,ABC Learning in 2008 was unprecedented and,198
NA,outlined some of the consequences of that.,198
NA,"100,000 families would have had to find alternative",198

NA,ensure toileting and nappy-changing procedures,198
NA,"put their children in child care, I know that",198
NA,which is why the national quality,198
NA,This bill supports the government's $273.7,198
NA,framework. The framework has already been,198
NA,work done on this in recent years. The framework,198
NA,that each child gets more individual time,198
NA,qualification requirements so that educators,198
NA,youngsters and help them to learn and develop.,198
NA,know the quality of care on offer and can make,198
NA,my constituency the ability to know exactly where,198
NA,of care that that child will receive is perhaps,198
NA,childcare centre. The amendments also reduce,198
NA,"opposition speaker's claim to the contrary, by",198
NA,regulator. We know that the first five years of,198
NA,in the childcare system that is available for,198
NA,is important that we do this efficiently. The,198
NA,government greater scrutiny over operators and,198
NA,government to offset and recover payments owed,198
NA,"same operator. Up until now, that has not been",198
NA,able to pursue recovery of payments from the,198
NA,who run up debts to the Commonwealth in,198
NA,"actions via another service. For example, when",198
NA,"the market and re-emerges in a similar form, the",198
NA,that new entity for recovery.,198
NA,"very important. In fact, we have been working to",198
NA,centres for quite some time. The collapse of,198
NA,it was quite a shock. The member for Blair has,198
NA,"If the government had not acted quickly, almost",198
NA,care arrangements with very little notice.,198
NA,changes to ensure financial viability of,198
NA,the approvals processes and requiring additional,198
NA,approvals process includes financial checks for,198
NA,are viable from the outset and well placed to,198
NA,build on that work to ensure that we have a,198
NA,that is very important to parents seeking,198
NA,"for parents. As I said, we have made significant",198
NA,parents. Quality is another issue which parents,198
NA,that quality is not always what it should be. A,198
NA,accredited between 1 July and 31 December 2010,198
NA,around a quarter of them failed to ensure that,198
NA,were inaccessible to children or failed to,198
NA,were positive experiences. For parents who,198
NA,"reading this report would cause great concern,",198
NA,framework is incredibly important.,198
NA,million investment in the national quality,198
NA,endorsed by COAG. There has been significant,198

NA,"and attention, and it introduces educator",198
NA,are better able to lead activities that inspire,198
NA,It includes a new rating system so that parents,198
NA,informed choices. I know that for parents in,198
NA,they are putting their child and the quality,198
NA,one of the most important factors in choosing a,198
NA,"the regulatory burden, in spite of the",198
NA,requiring childcare centres to only deal with one,198
NA,a child's life shape their future. It is perhaps the,198
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,198
NA,five years that have more importance in determining,199
NA,that we live through. So it is incredibly,199
NA,The new national quality framework enables,199
NA,childcare services that are regulated by state,199
NA,centres by not requiring them to provide the,199
NA,while this bill seems to deal with rather,199
NA,incredibly important reforms that the government,199
NA,pleased to support this bill.,199
Ms HALL ,Shortland-Government Whip),199
NA,services for which any government can take,199
NA,parents with certainty that their children will,199
NA,opportunity to learn. So it is about care and,199
NA,"the Rudd and Gillard governments, we have",199
NA,"child care, improving accessibility to child",199
NA,Adequate child care is not something that is a,199
NA,access to affordable child care.,199
NA,That is why the government is providing,199
NA,education and child care. This is almost $12.8,199
NA,four years of the Howard government. That is,199
NA,and children's education services. This,199
NA,"governments to look at outcomes for children,",199
NA,see how important child care is. Then you look,199
NA,how undervalued child care was under that government.,199
NA,the right of all families and all children. I think,199
NA,"quality child care is a privilege, not a right.",199
NA,The government is also providing $16.4,199
NA,annually with the cost of child care through,199

NA,2005.,206
NA,The bill is not major in its consequences.,206
NA,amends the definition of 'aviation industry,206
NA,cargo agents. The act distinguishes between,206
NA,cargo agents. AACAs include smaller operators,206
NA,"less complex business operations, including",206
NA,"AACAs are not defined as aviation industry participants,",206
NA,the same level of obligations that applies,206
NA,"Importantly, AACAs are currently not subject",206

NA,within the definition of an aviation industry,206
NA,special security directions and will allow for,206
NA,The amendments will also mean that AACAs,206
NA,will compel them to comply with incident,206
NA,business in having to develop and comply with,206
NA,concern to the opposition. These are small operators,206
NA,previously not considered to be of such import,206
NA,the legislation. I accept that there is good reason,206
NA,"may be just peripheral players, but it would",206
NA,kind of planning and regulations that apply,206
NA,operators. I have been assured that the burden,206
NA,AACAs will complete an online application,206
NA,transport security program which they can,206
NA,"words, there will essentially be something",206
NA,monitor whether in fact that transport security,206
NA,intrusive and delivers what is intended,206
NA,"Secondly, the bill extends the validity",206
NA,December 2012 unless revised prior to that,206
NA,amendment is intended to ease the burden,206
NA,transition to the new arrangements. The transition,206

NA,make sure that our country is kept safe from,206

NA,generally supported the measures put forward,206
NA,security as a logical progression of the Wheeler,206
NA,by the former coalition government in,206
NA,"It makes four amendments. Firstly, the bill",206
NA,participant' in the act to include accredited air,206
NA,registered air cargo agents and accredited air,206
NA,involved in the aviation industry who have,206
NA,couriers and contract drivers. Currently the,206
NA,which means they are not subject to,206
NA,to RACAs in times of heightened security.,206
NA,to special security directions. In late October,206
NA,unsuccessfully to send explosive devices,206
NA,security requirements were implemented,206
NA,special security directions. Including AACAs,206
NA,participant will mean that they are also subject to,206
NA,a more consistent response to security threats.,206
NA,must have a transport security program and,206
NA,reporting requirements. The burden on small,206
NA,these reporting requirements was a matter of,206
NA,by definition. They are people who were,206
NA,in the chain that they needed to be included in,206
NA,to include in the legislation even those who,206
NA,be unfair if new legislation required the same,206
NA,to large businesses to also apply to these small,206
NA,"on small business has been addressed, as the",206
NA,form which will automatically generate a,206
NA,print off and keep for their reference-in other,206
NA,on the shelf that they can use. We will need to,206
NA,"program is relevant to their needs, is not unduly",206
NA,in relation to enhancing cargo security.,206
NA,of the RACA transport security programs to 31,206
NA,date or cancelled at an earlier date. This,206
NA,on industry and the department during the,206
NA,will allow industry to determine which,206
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,206
NA,regulatory scheme is the most appropriate for,207
NA,compliance costs and streamlining arrangements,207
NA,"Thirdly, this bill allows for a legislative",207
NA,requirements for RACAs and AACAs. This amendment,207
NA,training outcomes and in doing so raise the,207
NA,"security across the industry. Again, let me",207
NA,restrictive and time-consuming training components,207
NA,is that we need to make sure that they know,207
NA,but one would hope that these skill assessments,207
NA,time that these often battling businesses are,207
NA,their time away at training programs. Business,207
NA,its obligations to undertake training. Training,207

NA,"Fourthly and finally, the bill makes",207
NA,certification provisions to reflect industry,207
NA,replacing the term 'freight' with the term 'cargo'.,207
NA,"the difference, but in reality this is one of",207
NA,amendments in this bill.,207
NA,The matters before the main committee,207
NA,tendency of the current government to introduce,207
NA,bill in relation to aviation security that deals,207
NA,earth they cannot get their act together and,207
NA,"legislation. But I know that the minister, in",207
NA,up at the end of the year and boast about the,207
NA,parliament. This will be another one. It will,207
NA,not included in last session's aviation security,207
NA,"in this session, is beyond me. If the objective",207
NA,government has got its priorities right.,207
NA,The coalition supports the sensible evolution,207
NA,provided the new measures are fully explained,207
NA,"diminished. However, we need to not just concentrate",207
NA,"sure it is right, although that is of course",207
NA,necessary resources to rebuild the quarantine,207
NA,that Customs has adequate resources to do the,207
NA,also need to ensure that security flights and,207
NA,"in this budget, are restored so that we can",207
NA,"their business, potentially therefore reducing",207
NA,for some of the participants.,207
NA,instrument to prescribe security training,207
NA,is designed to ensure consistency in,207
NA,skill level of AACAs and RACAs to increase,207
NA,emphasise the importance of not imposing unduly,207
NA,on these very small operators. The reality,207
NA,"what their job is and they know what to look for,",207
NA,and training programs do not so eat into their,207
NA,unable to remain profitable because they spend all,207
NA,feels overloaded at the present time by all of,207
NA,"is important, but you can be highly trained and",207
NA,of the fact that this kind of thing intrudes,207
NA,"doing the training, and it therefore may affect",207
NA,"prescribe the requirements, which will happen as a",207
NA,will increase transparency and allow for the,207
NA,levels of security training. That of course is the,207
NA,should adopt an unnecessarily heavy-handed,207
NA,"two minor technical amendments, one to remove",207
NA,practices and the other to clarify terminology by,207
NA,I do not think too many people would know,207
NA,the changes that is included in the minor technical,207
NA,are relatively minor. It is typical of another,207
NA,in almost every session a new amendment,207
NA,with just trivial matters. I do not know why on,207
NA,deal with all these things in a single piece of,207
NA,"his other role as Leader of the House, likes to get",207
NA,number of bills that have been passed by the,207
NA,"pass with very little controversy, but why it was",207
NA,"legislation, or the one that we will no doubt get",207
NA,is quantity rather than quality I do not think the,207
NA,"of aviation security and screening measures,",207
NA,and overall security measures are not,207
NA,on the regulatory regime and making,207
NA,"important, but the government must devote the",207

NA,complimentary of the fact that we do not take,208
NA,"such as aviation security, particularly in respect",208
NA,growing change that is occurring in that space,208
NA,way that not only do they support the carriage,208
NA,they are indebted to this government for being,208
NA,simply putting them away and then having a,208
NA,and then. Instead we are doing things when it,208
NA,I too support the Aviation Transport Security,208
NA,"security is a concern to all Australians, regardless",208

NA,way of doing business. Australian consumers,208
NA,associated with that is the speed of delivery;,208

NA,"I know a bit about that, because I have worked",208
NA,past-particularly the Sydney Airports Corporation.,208
NA,"required, not only for airfreight but for any",208
NA,which are rapidly becoming very common in our,208
NA,stay very much in tune with the fact that there,208
NA,As someone said a little facetiously about,208
NA,sitting on your hands until you have enough,208

NA,"groups referred to as accredited air cargo agents,",208
NA,"air cargo agents. They are smaller, maybe irregular.",208
NA,"directions were able to be issued, for instance",208
NA,The same directives were not able to be sent,208
NA,something that must be corrected. That is why,208
NA,"Unlike the member for Wide Bay, who might want",208
NA,pest-free and disease-free status is maintained,208
NA,On behalf of the government I thank,208
NA,"between the lines, I think he was trying to",208
NA,a vigilance on these issues. I think he was,208
NA,our eye off the ball when it comes to issues,208
NA,to passenger and cargo movements. With the,208
NA,I think the coalition is trying to say in a veiled,208
NA,of this particular piece of legislation but also,208
NA,ever so vigilant on these issues. We are not,208
NA,big piece of legislation introduced every now,208
NA,is required. This is an issue that is required.,208
NA,Amendment (Air Cargo) Bill 2011. Aviation,208

NA,"therefore, airfreight forwarding is one of the fast-",208
NA,very closely with the aviation sector in my,208
NA,I know the amount of space that is,208
NA,"additional berths for air cargo transporters now,",208
NA,"aviation space. That being the case, we must",208
NA,are growing security issues associated with it.,208
NA,"the member for Wide Bay, this is not a matter of",208
NA,to justify running a substantial document and,208
NA,for this industry. We must be prepared to make,208
NA,stay ahead of the game when it comes to issues,208
NA,in late October that terrorists operating out of,208
NA,inside a set of printers in an air cargo,208
NA,States. What occurred there was that people,208
NA,government responded very quickly and took,208
NA,"public and the Australian aviation sector,",208
NA,this case originating from Yemen and,208
NA,"directions, as they are called, issued to the",208
NA,That worked very well. The product coming in,208
NA,screening but screening prior to being loaded.,208
NA,We are also talking in this space of air cargo,208
NA,AACAs. They are not the same as regulated,208
NA,So under current legislation these special,208
NA,"as a result of the Yemeni incidents, to RACAs.",208
NA,to accredited air cargo agents. That is obviously,208
NA,this piece of legislation is going through now.,208
NA,to feel comfortable and be able to sit back,208
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,208
NA,and wait until we accumulate a certain amount,209
NA,this is something that was very real in October,209
NA,concerted attack using air cargo as the delivery,209
NA,"responded well, but they identified that there",209
NA,put it beyond doubt-that all those receiving,209
NA,the same specifications. That has now occurred.,209
NA,fundamentally does four things: it improves,209
NA,security threats such as what occurred last,209
NA,ease the regulatory burden on air cargo industry,209
NA,by the government in 2010 are enacted; it includes,209
NA,industry and improves the transparency and,209
NA,it also-almost as an efficiency measure-simplifies,209

NA,This amendment is important as we as a,209
NA,prevent unlawful interference with our aviation,209
NA,dealing with means that amendments such as,209
NA,game in the security environment. This is,209
NA,Law Enforcement is currently looking at again,209
NA,"case, maritime transport safety. Arrangements",209

NA,"government, as I said, in the Yemeni incident",209
NA,quickly and it did so to protect the Australian,209
NA,Australian airspace. Nobody would,209
NA,This amendment also streamlines the importance,209
NA,improving their transparency. It ensures that,209
NA,same training provisions and are subject to,209
NA,provides for special security directions to,209
NA,heightened security.,209
NA,Another important aspect is that this amendment,209
NA,best practice in the world. To align ourselves,209
NA,travelling public and those who rely on cargo,209
NA,"country, as a consequence of ensuring that not",209
NA,the best outcomes in this particular,209
NA,This amendment was given rise to by an,209
NA,2010. That we reacted as best we could and,209
NA,regulations and have moved promptly to do,209

NA,"that is applauded, not something that the Opposition",209

NA,increase flexibility in responding to heightened,209
NA,the regulatory burden and cost to industry,209
NA,"of issues before we do something, we know",209

NA,device. As a consequence our agencies,209
NA,"was an issue that needed to be tightened up, to",209
NA,air cargo into this country should be subject to,209
NA,The amendment is an important one. It,209

NA,members while the new initiatives announced,209
NA,training requirements for the air cargo,209
NA,consistency of training amongst its members; and,209
NA,the air cargo clearance processes in this,209
NA,government must do all that we can to deter and,209

NA,something the Parliamentary Joint Committee on,209
NA,"in terms of air transport safety and, in their",209
NA,are such that we are capable of preventing and,209

NA,Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (11:21): I rise,210

NA,"to us at this stage, to protect Australia and",210
NA,those who rely on the importation of air cargo are,210
NA,of those who use air cargo as another means,210
NA,world. I commend this piece of legislation. I,210
NA,by all. It should be supported for the right,210
NA,the government has acted promptly to ensure,210
NA,in the security environment that is world's best,210
NA,to speak on the Aviation Transport Security,210
NA,of legislation proposed by the government is,210
NA,from GroceryWatch to pink batts to border,210
NA,turns to a complete and utter shambles. As we,210
NA,"would struggle to run a chook raffle. However,",210
NA,that on the very rare occasion when the,210

NA,"Every year, over 26 million tonnes of goods",210
NA,30 per cent of all international trade in goods is,210

NA,"of goods more frequently, quickly and",210
NA,an island continent with no land borders and,210
NA,"of the world, relies more heavily on efficient",210
NA,country. Although airfreight represents less than,210

NA,"Measures) Bill 2011 because, despite the rhetoric,",218
NA,balanced and duly targeted to strengthen,218
NA,suppose that is one of the challenges in this,218
NA,occasionally. At least the coalition will vote,218
NA,will not waste an opportunity to try and target,218
NA,"that they are all going to come in here, line",218
NA,that is that this is the right thing to do.,218
NA,This bill will bolster our ability to monitor,218
NA,high-risk cargo by strengthening our control,218
NA,part of this government's commitment to,218
NA,Protection Service and seeks to streamline,218
NA,Smooth and safe international export processes,218
NA,environment. In my electorate of Fowler,218
NA,businesses that act out of the south-west of,218
NA,some of the processes that will make their job,218
NA,the way they go about their business.,218
NA,It is crucial that the Australian Customs,218
NA,quickly and effectively to any security concerns.,218
NA,Australia's trade and business. It is essential,218
NA,authorities are able to manage high-risk cargo,218
NA,the other security improvement initiatives,218
NA,executive officer of Customs to ensure compliance,218
NA,territory jurisdictions. It will also address breaches,218
NA,liability offences. These measures will increase,218
NA,"They will also make doing the right thing-and,",218
NA,our areas are in business to do the right thing-easier,218
NA,the path a lot easier for them by introducing,218
NA,clearer procedures and terminology is one aspect,218
NA,licence holders.,218
NA,As I said-and I think this would probably,218
NA,export businesses do have a fundamental role,218
NA,greater clarity. It will streamline their activities,218
NA,it will assist Customs and Border Protection,218
NA,which are potentially high risk,218
NA,The bill aligns legislation more closely with,218
NA,these measures will streamline export processes,218
NA,cargo. The changes it makes to existing legislation,218
NA,based on the findings of the joint Customs,218
NA,Infrastructure and Transport review. Many of,218
NA,industry stakeholders who have suggested many,218
NA,under this budget are nothing short of a national,218
NA,more about these cuts in the days ahead.,218
NA,Like the member for Stirling I also,218
NA,Amendment (Export Controls and Other,218
NA,he knows this is something that is properly,218
NA,Customs and border security of this country. I,218
NA,place: to cut through some of the rhetoric,218
NA,"the right way on this particular measure, but they",218
NA,the budget or anything else. But it is important,218
NA,up and support it. The reason they are going to do,218
NA,and respond to specific security concerns with,218
NA,over international export cargo. The bill forms,218
NA,a strong and efficient Customs and Border,218
NA,and strengthen the export and import processes.,218
NA,are vital to Australia's trading and business,218
NA,I am staggered by the amount of import-export,218
NA,Sydney. This clearly envisages that. I will go to,218
NA,easier by giving a greater degree of clarity in,218
NA,and Border Protection Service is able to respond,218
NA,Unmanaged risks in exports threatens,218
NA,that our Customs and border protection,218
NA,effectively and efficiently. This bill supports,218
NA,relating to export cargo and enables the chief,218
NA,"with the laws of Commonwealth, state and",218
NA,of licence conditions by introducing strict,218
NA,accountability and compliance with the law.,218
NA,"let's face it, most of our businesspeople in",218
NA,in terms of compliance and will make,218
NA,a greater degree of clarity into the process. So,218
NA,that will provide greater clarity to these,218
NA,go for most members in this place-import and,218
NA,"in our modern economy, and this will give them",218
NA,and will give greater certainty. But in doing so,218
NA,Service authorities to be able to manage areas,218
NA,in terms of our export trade.,218
NA,the existing export business processes. Clearly,218
NA,and will not compromise legitimate export,218
NA,are proportionate and balanced. They are,218
NA,and Border Protection Service and Department of,218
NA,the changes in the bill are made in response to,218
NA,"of the changes, particularly with respect to",218
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,218

NA,supporting these measures.,219

NA,Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (12:06):,219
NA,(Export Controls and Other Measures) Bill,219
NA,Customs Act and the Customs Depot Licensing,219
NA,control that Customs has over our export cargo,219
NA,licence conditions.,219
NA,The coalition is prepared to support this,219
NA,bill is contradictory to the government's general,219
NA,"bill increases controls on our exports,",219
NA,"weakening controls on our imports, as we have",219
NA,where we have seen New Zealand apples being,219
NA,risk of fire blight. We have also seen the results,219
NA,"protection and border security, with the financial",219
NA,has caused and a blowout in costs of $1.7,219
NA,been spent in other vitally needed sectors of,219
NA,security because of this government's failed policies.,219
NA,Therefore you would think that the government,219
NA,came to fiddling with our long-standing and,219
NA,"the government are prepared to roll the dice,",219
NA,"biosecurity. But God help them if, by weakening",219
NA,blight take hold in this country. They will,219
NA,"So, while the coalition does support this bill,",219
NA,monitored to ensure that it does not tie down,219
NA,who underwrite our economic prosperity.,219
NA,"chests, but instead this government's plans",219
NA,vessels which has been lost and reports already,219
NA,of streamlining. Border security is an issue that,219
NA,a very big island. But to ensure that we have,219
NA,we need to be able to encourage proper and,219
NA,within this country. This bill is significantly,219
NA,"the government's commitment in this area. And,",219
NA,of the opposition-am only too happy to be,219

NA,areas is not only ongoing; security in these,219
NA,"in the debate before last, concerning the",219
NA,"Cargo) Bill, the leader of the Nationals",219
NA,audacity to bring forward amendments. That,219
NA,terrorist event that occurred in October of last,219
NA,until we have a suite of possible amendments,219
NA,put through. As a government we are going to act,219
NA,we will make those changes and make no apology,219
NA,if that is what it takes to strengthen our,219
NA,people and our communities. I commend this piece,219
NA,I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment,219
NA,2011. The purpose of this bill is to amend the,219
NA,Charges Act to strengthen the extent of,219
NA,and to ensure consistent depot and warehouse,219
NA,"bill. However, we do note that the nature of this",219
NA,approach in many other measures. While this,219
NA,at the very same time we have this government,219
NA,seen with the soft approach on biosecurity,219
NA,allowed into the country with the potential,219
NA,of the government's soft approach to border,219
NA,and human disasters that this soft approach,219
NA,"billion-that is, $1,700 million-that could have",219
NA,the economy if it had not been spent on border,219
NA,would err on the side of caution when it,219
NA,"successful biosecurity arrangements. However,",219
NA,cross their fingers and hope for the best on,219
NA,"our controls on our borders, we see fire",219
NA,be held responsible for decades to come.,219
NA,we say that its effects must be very carefully,219
NA,our exporters in red tape. For it is our exporters,219
NA,We should be pinning medals on our exporters',219
NA,are to burden them with a tax on carbon dioxide,219
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,219
NA,"emissions, placing them at a competitive disadvantage.",220
NA,"supports this bill, we say its effects must be",220
NA,small business. Exporting is hard enough. It,220

NA,"potential to do. In conclusion, the coalition",220
NA,its effects very closely.,220
Mr TEHAN ,Wannon) (12:09): I rise,220

NA,"fairly straightforward and, as the two previous",220
NA,"articulated, they will be supported on this side.",220
NA,"While we are dealing with this bill, I think",220
NA,there has on the whole been support for the great,220
NA,is a real shame that the government mismanagement,220
NA,not in the national interest have meant that,220
NA,million cut to the budget of the Australian,220

NA,the government taking an axe to people who,220

NA,better fashion that meant that those out there,220

NA,"supports this bill. However, we will be monitoring",220
NA,to also support the passage of the Customs,220

NA,to grant a warehouse licence; allow the CEO to,220

NA,is all very well to speak against something and,221
NA,concerns that have allegedly been raised within,221

NA,Service to respond to security concerns in,221
NA,consistency between the licensed depot and,221

NA,better oversight by Customs of such goods-which,222
NA,"believe is increasingly important, given the potential",222

NA,ineffectiveness of this report in addressing,223
NA,"committee-that is, to assist problem gamblers.",223
NA,recommendations put forward by the majority,223
NA,"coalition members, will harm the industry significantly.",223

NA,that was done between Julia Gillard and,223
NA,"government, we are now faced with the situation",223
NA,implementation of laws that will see nothing,223
NA,gamblers but will have a truly detrimental effect,223
NA,"Why is this so, and how can I be certain: because",223
NA,the public and others with respect,223
NA,"In summary, it is relatively straightforward.",223
NA,Party is only motivated to do something in this,223
NA,deal with the Independent member for Denison.,223
NA,machine reform was not a burning ambition of,223
NA,was not something that was on the radar,223
NA,demanded by the Independent member for Denison,223
NA,through the implementation of a mandatory,223
NA,"'Yes, we believe in it too.'",223
NA,In fact the most concerning aspect of this,223

NA,"mandatory precommitment, then this would not",223
NA,Labor has signed up to this holus-bolus.,223

NA,What concerned me was that for those,223

NA,was not a case of having an inquiry into,223
NA,rather the answer was already given: there,223
NA,committee's task was simply to look at the,223

NA,"Broader than that, I am concerned that the",223
NA,"of the committee, which did not include",223
NA,"We end up in a situation where, as a",223

NA,happening with respect to assisting problem,223
NA,on the pubs and clubs sector across Australia.,223
NA,of the valid concerns raised by members of,223

NA,We know as a matter of history that the Labor,223
NA,space as a consequence of the Prime Minister's,223
NA,We know as a matter of history that poker,223
NA,"the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or cabinet. It",223
NA,for this government until such time as it was,223
NA,"that there be reform in this space, namely,",223
NA,"precommitment system, that Labor suddenly said,",223
NA,is that it is now Labor Party policy to implement,223
NA,this agenda. The reality is that if it were,223
NA,Independent member for Denison that wanted,223
NA,happen. The reason why it will happen is that,223
NA,It is now Labor Party policy to have mandatory,223
NA,of us who were appointed to the joint select,223
NA,with exploring mandatory precommitment; it,223
NA,whether mandatory precommitment would work;,223
NA,would be mandatory precommitment and the,223

NA,implicitly as well as on the basis,224
NA,"I think it is time that Labor members,",224
NA,were held to account to back up their rhetoric,224
NA,they will fail. The reason they will fail is,224
NA,particular report and the recommendations,224
NA,overcome because they are illogical. The fundamental,224
NA,from Labor members and indeed from the Independent,224
NA,mandatory precommitment would assist Australia's,224
NA,they would be required to precommit to a certain,224
NA,"sounds rational. On first principles, you would",224
NA,"someone has a gambling problem, wouldn't logic",224
NA,make them commit to a certain level of losses,224
NA,seems like common sense. But what is clear,224
NA,"a pathological problem. By definition, that",224
NA,"definition, someone who is a problem gambler-someone",224
NA,"home, someone who is potentially losing their",224
NA,"criminal activity, someone who is potentially",224
NA,of their gambling addiction-is,224
NA,"That is the very reason why, when you say",224
NA,"losing their home, losing their loved ones",224
NA,potentially suicidal as a direct consequence,224
NA,responsible for setting your own gambling limit.,224
NA,doomed to fail from the outset. Problem,224
NA,examples-will set a limit that is exceptionally,224
NA,"consequence, this piece of technology which",224
NA,like to hold out as the silver bullet solution,224
NA,pathological gambling addiction will not sit,224
NA,"look into the issue very much, you would think it",224
NA,"I have seen Labor member after Labor member,",224
NA,"stand up, hand on heart, palms wringing,",224
NA,in Australia.' I have heard Labor member,224
NA,for Denison and others engage in rhetoric about,224
NA,do something for problem gamblers. As if anyone,224
NA,findings of the committee was in some way not,224
NA,exchange between the member for Kingston and me,224
NA,that comes from those who back the,224
NA,that in some way I and other members of the,224
NA,are not concerned about problem,224
NA,"would moralise on this issue, would claim a",224
NA,in reality they do not know the first thing,224
NA,"problem gamblers. That is the great disgrace,",224
NA,a result of these recommendations will in fact,224
NA,to explain why because I understand this topic,224
NA,of the evidence that has been supplied.,224
NA,"the member for Denison and Senator Xenophon,",224
NA,"when it comes to this report, because I know",224
NA,that there are several fundamental flaws with this,224
NA,of the majority of the report which cannot be,224
NA,"thrust from the member for Denison,",224
NA,"senator, Senator Xenophon, was that",224
NA,problem gamblers because of the fact that,224
NA,"level of losses. On first principles, that",224
NA,have to ask: who could disagree with that? If,224
NA,suggest the very best thing you could do is,224
NA,and then be shut out of the system? It just,224
NA,from the evidence is that problem gamblers have,224
NA,is why they are called problem gamblers. By,224
NA,who is potentially losing their,224
NA,"job, someone who is potentially engaging in",224
NA,hurting the loved ones around them as a result,224
NA,"not logical, is not rational.",224
NA,to a problem gambler who is already potentially,224
NA,and putting their life on the line and who is,224
NA,"of their gambling habit, 'Look, you are",224
NA,"We think you'll be able to handle that,' it is",224
NA,gamblers-and we know this from international,224
NA,"high, well above what they can afford. As a",224
NA,the Labor Party and the member for Denison,224
NA,will in fact fail miserably. Someone with a,224
NA,"there and think to themselves, 'You know, I can",224
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,224
NA,"only afford to lose $50 this week, so I'm going",225
NA,spiral of irrationality that will see them set,225
NA,"limit will be? But I guarantee you one thing,",225
NA,"limit, because this is a person who is battling",225
NA,"and their family, who is having an impact on",225
NA,apparently they are meant to have this moment,225
NA,afford $50 this week. That will be my limit.',225
NA,The reality is that problem gamblers have,225
NA,intervention. They need support and assistance,225
NA,"gambling and that they should not be gambling,",225
NA,only people who will stand by a rational limit,225
NA,addiction. We know from the psychological,225
NA,problem gamblers chase their losses. They are,225
NA,"more shot, if only they had one more big wager,",225
NA,they have already lost. That is the psychology,225
NA,unrealistic loss limits on their cards. That,225
NA,people who will set rational loss limits on,225
NA,million gamblers out of the five million poker,225
NA,"limits. I welcome the member for Denison,",225
NA,the people who will set rational loss limits,225
NA,recognise that it is having an impact on their lives.,225
NA,"In addition to that, from the outset I have",225
NA,national database this system is doomed to,225
NA,"member for Denison and from Labor members,",225
NA,was scaremongering to suggest that there had,225
NA,to be a national database. This is where it all,225
NA,"majority report of this committee, because they",225
NA,national database. I have heard the member,225
NA,'People don't have to worry because the information,225
NA,"national database, there is nothing at all to",225
NA,use a local example from my electorate-the,225
NA,from the club after supplying their 100 points,225
NA,"identity verification, setting their limit at",225
NA,thinking: 'I've got to chase that loss. I'm going,225
NA,in their car and drive down to the Broadbeach,225
NA,to sign up for a card here. I want to play the,225
NA,way that that bowls club can know what the surf,225
NA,"one, that person could have a card from every",225
NA,way to verify that this person is not using multiple,225
NA,do that is to have a national database. Even the,225
NA,the member for Denison and Labor members,225
NA,"jurisdiction, does not overcome the problem",225
NA,"example, where we have a border right through",225
NA,jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There must be a national,225
NA,"this to work. Otherwise, the person can have",225
NA,"to set my limit at $50.' No, they are bound in a",225
NA,"a limit of $1,000 or $10,000. Who knows what the",225
NA,Madam Deputy Speaker: it will not be a rational,225
NA,"an addiction, who is already losing their home",225
NA,loved ones and who is potentially suicidal. Yet,225
NA,"of clarity where they will say, 'I can only",225
NA,a pathological problem and they need medical,225
NA,to make them realise that they cannot handle,225
NA,"full stop. That is what is required, because the",225
NA,are rational people who do not have a gambling,225
NA,evidence that was given to the committee that,225
NA,of the view that if only they were given one,225
NA,they would be able to win back that which,225
NA,and that is exactly what drives them to set,225
NA,is why this technology simply will not work. The,225
NA,their cards are recreational gamblers-the 4.8,225
NA,machine players. They will set reasonable,225
NA,who has just come into the Committee. These are,225
NA,on their cards. These are the people who will,225
NA,made it clear that without the integrity of a,225
NA,fail. I was met with cries of protest from the,225
NA,who said I was scaremongering. They said I,225
NA,to be biometric identifiers and that there needed,225
NA,just conveniently slips through the net in the,225
NA,like to conveniently disregard the need for a,225
NA,for Denison say this on numerous occasions:,225
NA,will be kept on the card.' Without a,225
NA,prevent a problem gambler from going into-I will,225
NA,"Southport Surf Lifesaving Club, getting a card",225
NA,"of ID, or whatever the regime may be for",225
NA,"$500 or whatever, expending that limit and then",225
NA,to go to the club down the road.' So they jump,225
NA,Bowls Club. They go in there and say: 'I'd like,225
NA,pokies.' Without a national database there is no,225
NA,lifesaving club has on their system. Without,225
NA,pub and club that they wanted. There must be a,225
NA,cards in multiple venues. The only way to,225
NA,"preferred, short-term political fix solution that",225
NA,"have proposed, which is that it be state based",225
NA,"that in tourism towns like the Gold Coast, for",225
NA,"the guts of it, people can swap across from",225
NA,database. It is an absolute requirement for,225
NA,all of their particulars on their smart card from,225
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,225
NA,the Southport Surf Life Saving Club-the assurance,226
NA,members like to claim-but that does not mean,226
NA,venue when they provide their ID and the venues,226
NA,"heard members opposite address that, and",226
NA,address that very issue. I invite members opposite,226
NA,integrity without having a central database.,226
NA,cannot.,226
NA,"In addition to that, let us talk about the",226
NA,million Australians who play the poker machines,226
NA,months. This is the person who goes to the,226
NA,"100 points of ID, gets their card, plays their",226
NA,does not think about it for three months. Three,226
NA,"club or even the same club and say, 'I would like",226
NA,is your card from three months ago? You are,226
NA,"to see your card.' If the person says, 'I'm sorry.",226
NA,Can you issue me with another one?' isn't that,226
NA,they just issue you with another card? You,226
NA,that the problem gambler who just had a massive,226
NA,"saying, 'I'm sorry. I lost my card. Can I",226
NA,assume that there are some systems in place,226
NA,"ago, has not thought about it again since, does",226
NA,"Again, I would love to hear from members opposite",226
NA,never heard it. The devil is in the detail when,226
NA,detail every step of the way.,226
NA,The single most offensive aspect of this-and,226
NA,"members opposite with respect to the 70,000",226
NA,and the 4.8 million recreational punters,226
NA,explanation that the reason the pubs and clubs,226
NA,massive deterioration in problem gambling,226
NA,members say that if you cannot survive as,226
NA,revenue then you have a failed business model.,226
NA,"the report itself deals with it. That is disingenuous,",226
NA,revenue from problem gamblers. Their concerns,226
NA,are going to be put off playing the poker machines,226
NA,who do not have a problem. That is where the,226
NA,who are not going to provide 100 points of ID,226
NA,to put up with a great big new federal bureaucracy,226
NA,poker machines.,226
NA,Time does not allow me to get into the issue,226
NA,machines were not a central part of the committee's,226
NA,came in during the last several weeks. They,226
NA,inquiry of the committee. For reasons I will,226
NA,solution.,226
NA,that the member for Denison and Labor,226
NA,anything if they get another card from another,226
NA,do not know about each other. I have never,226
NA,I would dearly love to hear members opposite,226
NA,to please tell me how you can get system,226
NA,"They know what I know, which is that you",226
NA,recreational gamblers. Let us talk about the 4.8,226
NA,once a month or once every three or four,226
NA,"Southport Surf Life Saving Club, provides their",226
NA,"50 bucks on the poker machines, walks away and",226
NA,months later when they turn up to some other,226
NA,"to play the pokies,' the club will say, 'Where",226
NA,on the system as having a card already. We need,226
NA,I haven't played the pokies for three months.,226
NA,situation going to present some challenges? Do,226
NA,would assume not because how would you know,226
NA,loss the day before is not also turning up and,226
NA,"get another one?' Therefore, you would have to",226
NA,for the person who only had a punt three months,226
NA,not have a card on them and wants another one.,226
NA,"their solution to this, because I have",226
NA,"it comes to this, and they have been scant on",226
NA,it is offensive-that I have heard from,226
NA,people whose livelihoods rely on this industry,226
NA,who do not have a gambling problem is the,226
NA,are concerned is because there is going to be a,226
NA,revenue. The member for Denison and Labor,226
NA,a club with deterioration in problem-gambling,226
NA,"I have heard this time and time again. Indeed,",226
NA,because their concerns are not about the,226
NA,revolve around the fact that the people who,226
NA,are the 4.8 million recreational gamblers,226
NA,loss of revenue is going to come from-people,226
NA,"in order to get a card, people who are not going",226
NA,in order to have a $30 or $40 punt on the,226
NA,of low-intensity machines. But low-intensity,226
NA,focus. They were a quick political fix that,226
NA,deserve to be a core part of the focus of the,226
NA,"go into in another forum, they are also not the",226
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,226
NA,Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (12:39):,227
NA,that was tabled in parliament this week by,227
NA,"Gambling Reform, entitled The design and",227
NA,system for electronic gambling machines. The,227
NA,inquiry is that we have a problem. We have a,227
NA,"is a public health issue, it is a family issue,",227
NA,It will not go away as a result of the hysterical,227
NA,opposite me. It will go away because members,227
NA,about it.,227
NA,The reason we have an obligation to do something,227
NA,existence of gaming machines. We derive,227
NA,obligation to ensure that they are operating,227
NA,tell the members opposite and everybody else,227
NA,"proposition that any business, organisation",227
NA,others. Our objective in bringing these reforms,227
NA,properly regulate this form of gambling which,227
NA,effect on so many Australians.,227
NA,Throughout the 1990s there was a liberalisation,227
NA,led to what the Productivity Commission has,227
NA,"industry. In common speak, that has led to a",227
NA,and many other venues around the country.,227
NA,"close to 200,000 electronic gaming machines",227
NA,my state of New South Wales.,227
NA,"As I have already mentioned, we have an",227
NA,governments derive a source of revenue from,227
NA,derive about $5 billion per annum from gambling-about,227
NA,significant proportion of that comes from,227
NA,revenue in the economy as a whole was $19,227
NA,adult.,227
NA,"As members opposite have indicated, Australians",227
NA,having a punt myself. I am amongst the estimated,227
NA,"Unfortunately, about 115,000 people have",227
NA,people make up only about 15 per cent of,227
NA,somewhere between 26 per cent or 40 per,227
NA,particularly when you consider that hotels derive,227
NA,60 per cent of their revenue and casinos,227
NA,machines. We have a problem and we have to deal with it.,227
NA,"We can stick our heads in the sand, like",227
NA,and say that what we are doing at the moment,227
NA,House do not believe that that is fulfilling,227
NA,represent. We have put in place a proposition,227
NA,give up on problem gamblers and we do not,227
NA,"the member opposite seems to suggest, are",227
NA,understand and the evidence before the committee,227
NA,We are here today to comment on the report,227
NA,the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on,227
NA,implementation of a mandatory pre-commitment,227
NA,reason that this committee has conducted the,227
NA,"problem with pokies addiction, and it is real. It",227
NA,it is a workplace issue and it is an economic issue.,227
NA,speeches of those who sit in the chamber,227
NA,in this place have the courage to do something,227
NA,about it is that governments license the,227
NA,"revenue from them. Therefore, we have an",227
NA,safely and in line with community values. I can,227
NA,that the community simply does not accept the,227
NA,or government should profit from the misery of,227
NA,forward is to ensure that we are able to,227
NA,is proven to have an addictive and damaging,227
NA,of poker machines throughout Australia. It,227
NA,recently described as the maturation of the,227
NA,"growth in the number of machines in clubs, pubs",227
NA,So we have the situation today where there are,227
NA,"in this country, and nearly half of them are in",227
NA,obligation to do something about this because,227
NA,gaming and poker machine revenue. States,227
NA,10 per cent of state revenue-and a,227
NA,electronic gaming machines. The total gaming,227
NA,"billion in 2008-09, which is about $1,500 per",227
NA,do not mind having a punt. I do not mind,227
NA,"600,000 people who play poker machines.",227
NA,"a problem with gambling. While these 115,000",227
NA,"the total gambling population, they contribute",227
NA,"cent of gaming revenue. So we have a problem,",227
NA,"about one-third of their revenue, clubs about",227
NA,about 78 per cent of their revenue from these,227
NA,"the member for Moncrieff, opposite, begs us to do",227
NA,is good enough. But we on this side of the,227
NA,our obligation to the communities that we,227
NA,which says nothing more than this: we do not,227
NA,"think that people who play poker machines, as",227
NA,somehow mad and bad most of their lives. We,227
NA,"was quite simply that, yes, when problem",227
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,227
NA,gamblers and many other gamblers are in a,228
NA,machine they lose control and are not operating,228
NA,operate on normally. But even these people,228
NA,when they go home and they have to explain to,228
NA,they have to go to work the next day and explain,228
NA,"pay, or when they have to go and cash in their",228
NA,moments of reason and they understand that,228
NA,week or for the last 10 days when they were,228
NA,opposite has pointed out-was wrong. The tools,228
NA,give them some control over that gambling addiction.,228
Mr Ciobo, But they are not rational.,228
NA,Ms Rishworth: They're not irrational all the time.,228
NA,Mr STEPHEN JONES: As the member for Kingston,228
NA,have a problem all the time; they have a problem,228
NA,"have moments of reason, moments of lucidity.",228
NA,Mr Ciobo interjecting-,228
NA,Mr STEPHEN JONES: The evidence before,228
NA,It might have been evidence that was delivered,228
NA,opposite who is interjecting so much was not,228
NA,evidence before the committee-,228
Mr Ciobo, I rise on a point of order.,228
NA,"verballed, but statements of factual inaccuracy",228
NA,offensive.,228
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms K Livermore):,228
NA,point.,228
NA,Mr STEPHEN JONES: The second reason,228
NA,we believe the precommitment technology that,228
NA,good chance of solving or helping to resolve,228
NA,who have been identified by experts as at-risk,228
NA,They will avoid doing that by using the,228
NA,"themselves a budget to punt, a budget to",228
NA,monthly or yearly basis how much of their,228
NA,through a poker machine-how much they can afford to lose.,228
NA,So we have very good reasons to believe-we,228
NA,opposite-that the technologies and the systems,228
NA,work. We believe they will work because they,228
NA,problem gamblers and they will give problem,228
NA,"Rubicon some tools, in those moments of",228
NA,gambling addiction. Of course in and of itself,228
NA,and parcel of a package of solutions. The,228
NA,Committee on Gambling Reform,228
NA,Some objections have also been raised,228
NA,egregious costs that this is going to visit upon,228
NA,gaming environment and sitting before a poker,228
NA,on the basis of reason that most of us would,228
NA,have moments of lucidity and moments of reason,228
NA,"their wife, their husband or their kids, or when",228
NA,why they are asking for an advance in their,228
NA,television or their video recorder. They have,228
NA,"the behaviour they engaged in last night, last",228
NA,"on a binge-'chasing the losses', as the member",228
NA,that we are proposing to put in place will,228
NA,"has pointed out, these people do not",228
NA,when they are in a gaming situation. They,228
NA,the committee was quite clear on this point.,228
NA,on some of the many days when the member,228
NA,"there, but it was very clear that the expert",228
NA,I have a reasonably wide tolerance for being,228
NA,like that one should be withdrawn. I find them,228
NA,The member for Moncrieff has made his,228
NA,we do not give up on problem gamblers and,228
NA,has been the subject of this inquiry has a very,228
NA,problem gambling is that it will prevent people,228
NA,gamblers converting to problem gamblers.,228
NA,precommitment technology to effectively set,228
NA,"gamble, so that they know on a daily, weekly,",228
NA,family income they are going to be able to put,228
NA,are not as cynical as those members,228
NA,that we are proposing to put in place will,228
NA,will stop the conversion of at-risk gamblers to,228
NA,gamblers who have already crossed the,228
NA,"lucidity and reason, to take control of their",228
NA,it is not the complete solution. It has to be part,228
NA,recommendations put forward by the Joint Select,228
NA,go to a combination of solutions.,228
NA,throughout the course of the inquiry about the,228
NA,the industry. We have listened closely to this,228
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,228
NA,"evidence, and the report points out that for",229
NA,and these technologies can be introduced for,229
NA,fraction of the revenue that is generated by one,229
NA,"comment made, we do make the concession and",229
NA,"need, particularly for small clubs, for us to",229
NA,and we have recommended exactly that.,229
NA,I will make the point that the member for,229
NA,pointedly in his contribution to the debate.,229
NA,throughout the inquiry on this particular point.,229
NA,that somehow the introduction of this technology,229
NA,Australian citizen of some mammoth Big Brother,229
NA,"every aspect of their private, social and working",229
NA,truth. We have ruled out quite early the use,229
NA,many pubs are already introducing biometric,229
NA,premises here and now. Many pubs in the,229
NA,"reliably advised, are already introducing,",229
NA,"technology-fingerprint scanners, retina scanners-as",229
NA,"believe, and I am sure that many right-minded",229
NA,"Moncrieff-would agree with me, that this sort",229
NA,outside the realm of regulation; but,229
NA,The second point that I would make on the,229
NA,condition of the establishment of a club that,229
NA,ensure that anybody who enters the premises,229
NA,"Queensland and I suspect everywhere else,",229
NA,requirements of the legislation and is able by,229
NA,"the premises-the licensees, the club owners",229
NA,"premises and intend to use the facilities, including",229
NA,"those premises, they can show that identity.",229
NA,only does it exist but it collects information,229
NA,members and visitors and the clubs already use,229
NA,who are frequenters of electronic gaming,229
NA,value judgment about this whatsoever-as send,229
NA,"around to a regular punter's home and say,",229
NA,today; we will put on a meal and free drinks,229
NA,on.',229
NA,I make no value judgment about that whatsoever.,229
NA,already using this data and we believe that,229
NA,technology is no greater intrusion on a club,229
NA,"exists. In fact, through this mechanism we might",229
NA,many within the community think are not,229
NA,We are far more optimistic than those opposite.,229
NA,they think that we should do something about it,229
NA,"problem, we are a bit more optimistic. This",229
NA,than that. One of the recommendations of the,229
NA,the most part these claims are widely exaggerated,229
NA,a fraction of the cost that is estimated and a,229
NA,of these machines over its life span. With that,229
NA,we do understand that there is going to be a,229
NA,have a phased introduction of these technologies,229
NA,Moncrieff was alluding to and then going to quite,229
NA,I enjoyed his cross-examination of witnesses,229
NA,"It goes to the issue of privacy and intrusion,",229
NA,is going to be the visitation upon every,229
NA,database which is going to intrude upon,229
NA,lives. Nothing could be further from the,229
NA,"of biometric technology, despite the fact that",229
NA,technology as a condition of visiting their,229
NA,"state of New South Wales and elsewhere, I am",229
NA,"beyond the pale of regulation, biometric",229
NA,a condition of entering their premises. I,229
NA,citizens-and I suspect the member for,229
NA,of activity should probably not be occurring,229
NA,perhaps that is a matter for another day.,229
NA,issue of privacy and intrusion is that it is a,229
NA,they set up and keep a membership register and,229
NA,"of a club, at least in New South Wales or",229
NA,has proof of identity which satisfies the,229
NA,one means or another to satisfy the occupiers of,229
NA,and managers-that when they enter those,229
NA,the electronic gaming machine facilities on,229
NA,"That is to say, the database already exists. Not",229
NA,about the gaming habits of individual club,229
NA,that data to market to those patrons they know,229
NA,machines. They do such things-and I make no,229

NA,"at the football ground, or if Lionel was around.",242
NA,as we have heard today from the very generous,242
NA,debate and who have passed on their,242
NA,"Rose family. As their local member, I am as",242
NA,person of my background. But I am not distant,242
NA,the story of Jacksons Track. I do not think,242
NA,"that Lionel Rose is, coming out of Jacksons",242
NA,the journey of the young boy coming out of,242
NA,"or even NAIDOC Week, but he was out",242
NA,to do. It was great to hear from members of,242

NA,because of the work he has done with young,242
NA,to you now-we were there listening to you on,242
NA,"all of my life, when I have listened to or watched",242
NA,or one of his sporting colleagues was going to,242
NA,because that is what he was doing. Maybe it,242
NA,the nation was watching Lionel Rose. The nation,242
NA,hoping and praying for his wellbeing and his,242
NA,"left to go overseas, and when he achieved that",242
NA,of Melbourne-all the way from Essendon,242
NA,standing on the side of the road waiting for,242
NA,our new hero. And don't we love a hero!,242
NA,Landon wrote the story of Jacksons Track,242
NA,"I do not cry reading books, but I cried many",242
NA,"had to put the book down, and I could not read",242
NA,to a state where the tears in my eyes were not,242
NA,"Track. As a local member, I know where this",242
NA,desire within him. You would hear those,242
NA,"speed, his ability and the power that came from",242
NA,in Lionel Rose on the number of occasions that,242
NA,humble human being. That is the person I knew.,242
NA,He did not even have what you would call grace,242
NA,for Australia-to think that one of our,242
NA,Fighting Harada and win. As you have heard,242
NA,"how he was rated, if he was on Sportsbet going",242
NA,money on him at all. And he won. He won against,242
NA,he sang Telephone to Glory.,242

Mr Wyatt, That was Jimmy Little.,243
Mr BROADBENT," Yes, I know, but I think",243
NA,which was one of the songs that we sang,243
NA,"identification with Lionel because of that,",243
NA,fascinating to hear the members of parliament,243
NA,they have today.,243
NA,If this nation ever thinks that members of,243
NA,Indigenous communities and all that goes with,243
NA,wrong. When tears were shed here today we all,243
NA,"Bass. He said, 'I do not want to disgrace",243
NA,disgracing himself. There was not a person,243
NA,Rose.,243
NA,"I am sorry that he suffered after his stroke,",243
NA,that room was not just a hero but a family gathered,243
NA,care and in honour. He could go back to his,243
NA,"am very comfortable,' as he said to Kathy Bedford.",243
NA,am very happy. I am living life well.',243
NA,"His cousin, who was the chairman of the",243
NA,"Radio the other day. He said, 'He was never",243
NA,would always tell him that the football was,243
NA,there.' He loved being there at the footy with,243
NA,"his great talent and ability, his family's love",243
NA,"community, for his love of his family and just",243
NA,before he died.,243
Mr HUNT ,Flinders) (16:48): It is a great,243
NA,Rose and to do so after the members for Hasluck,243
NA,"in their own way, represent a part of this story.",243
NA,in which the great Lionel Rose grew up. It was,243
NA,"set out. It was a tough, hard background, but",243
NA,"journey. In my view, the definition of what we",243
NA,opportunity to live the life of their choice. The,243
NA,"the Danakil area of the Horn of Africa, Wilfred",243
NA,what we aspire to bring in some small measure,243
NA,of that life. He came from the most humble,243
NA,adjacent to my own electorate. I know that,243
NA,Gippsland this is somebody they looked to as,243
NA,affection many years-43 years-after he took,243
NA,Tokyo. He was looked upon as a local. He was,243
NA,trailblazer. But above all else he was looked,243
NA,courageous human being.,243
NA,So in our part of the world there is this great,243
NA,for Lionel Rose which goes back to the fact,243
NA,which should not have led him to the world,243
NA,terms and in his own way-a way which inspired,243
NA,"Lionel actually recorded Telephone to Glory,",243
NA,at my wedding. I am not saying I have an,243
NA,but I am saying that it has been interesting and,243
NA,in this place speak on Lionel Rose in the way,243
NA,"parliament do not care about our families, our",243
NA,"them, today is a perfect example of it being",243
NA,entered into that moment with the member for,243
NA,myself any more over this issue.' He was not,243
NA,"here who was not standing with him. Vale, Lionel",243
NA,but I want to let you all know that what I saw in,243
NA,"around an ordinary man in protection, in",243
NA,"community near Jacksons Track to live and say, 'I",243
NA,"He said, 'I am back with my family and I",243
NA,"Boxing Federation, was interviewed by ABC",243
NA,"on time, so to get him to the footy on time we",243
NA,"two hours earlier, and then we would get him",243
NA,"his family, watching his family play. Even with",243
NA,of him was for his ordinariness-for his love of,243
NA,for the fact that he was nestled in their arms,243
NA,honour to rise to speak in recognition of Lionel,243

NA,title of a book by the great British explorer in,243
NA,"Thesiger, was The Life of My Choice. If that is",243
NA,"to Australia, Lionel Rose was the embodiment",243

NA,"upon as an extraordinarily generous, decent and",243

NA,"stage but which did, and he did it on his own",243
NA,generations of young Australians from all,243
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,243
NA,"backgrounds. But on top of that he, along",244
NA,the way for Indigenous Australians to be,244
NA,themselves that sense of the possibility,244
NA,In that context we have somebody who was,244
NA,"the Mornington Peninsula of Victoria and, more",244
NA,"to Indigenous Australians; but, above all else-and",244
NA,brief recognition and tribute-an exemplar to all,244
NA,"is no doubt he was able to look back and,",244
NA,"own set of achievements-yes, there was hardship",244
NA,"and, yes, there was hardship at the finish-look",244
NA,that he had lived the life of his choice and,244
NA,to his family and brought joy to millions of Australians.,244
Mr TUDGE ,Aston) (16:52): I also rise to,244
NA,"Lionel Rose, and I would like to associate",244
NA,"speakers, including Mr Hunt and Mr Broadbent,",244
NA,I did not get to hear some of the earlier speakers,244
NA,moving and honourable tributes to this great man.,244

NA,"generally, Australia; a particular inspiration",244
NA,this is where I want to finish in this very,244
NA,of us of a life well lived. At end of day there,244
NA,with family and friends around him and with his,244
NA,"at the start; yes, it was hard along the way;",244
NA,"at a life well lived, believing and knowing",244
NA,done so in a way which brought honour to him and,244
NA,support the condolence motion for the late Mr,244
NA,myself with some of the comments of the previous,244
NA,whom I have just listened to here. I am sorry,244
NA,as well; I understand they also gave very,244

NA,"and he was a great Australian. Of course, he is",244
NA,for being the first world champion boxer for,244
NA,"in 1968 in Tokyo, coming up against the world",244
NA,Harada. Lionel was just 19 years old when he,244
NA,Few thought he would be able to win that fight,244
NA,"that he did; and, in doing so, he changed",244
NA,made an incredible contribution more broadly,244
NA,sporting superstars and other Indigenous role,244
NA,dozens of AFL footballers who dominate the,244

NA,make our country a better place. The life,251
NA,technological and other change. Yet that tradition,251
NA,"doing something for other people, of stepping",251
NA,forces-carries forward. The service and sacrifice,251
NA,has a connection and a bond to those who have,251
NA,"century-indeed, the span of the life of Claude",251
NA,His generation nurtured and preserved a way,251
NA,supporting this motion of the House today-and,251
NA,such a motion-that we also let future generations,251
NA,freedom and values of Australia through,251
NA,uniform all around the world deployed on our,251
NA,"and sacrifice of so many people like Claude, that",251
NA,to put themselves in harms way. I want to,251
NA,Claude's contribution and the contributions of,251
NA,"World War I, because it is very important. Out of",251
NA,"component of the entire world-416,809 men",251
NA,a great nation Australia truly is: in the cause,251

NA,citizen soldier-the ordinary person who steps,251
NA,for their friends and for their country-is the,251
NA,or system that can replicate that quality of a,251
NA,by their own choice. They do not ask what their,251
NA,can do for their country. Every free society that,251
NA,"republican Rome had the citizen soldier, and",251
NA,"England, privateers fought the Spanish and",251
NA,the United States of America were citizens who,251
NA,fight the oppression of invaders who they,251

NA,"I am pleased to say that we have, particularly",253

NA,association with anti-socialist policies,253
NA,He was a man of his time. I note the Labor Party,253
NA,am sure they do not mind being reminded of,253

NA,In a sense he showed me the 'two-minute Tim' trick:,253
NA,or a council chamber and do a fair dinkum tour of,253

NA,Oxley in a by-election in 1965. He retained the,253
NA,time he served as Minister for Agriculture and,253
NA,Wales. He resigned the seat in 1980 to contest,253
NA,and he held that seat until his retirement.,253
NA,"dates was that he served with my late father, who",253
NA,and also a minister. They served,253
NA,in my electorate office and in my home of Bruce,253
NA,assembly of New South Wales. I thought,253
NA,"in time Max Ruddock, who had also served in",253
NA,"had one of his former colleagues, also a deputy",253
NA,I came to see a lot of Bruce. I enjoyed his,253
NA,contribution to make in public service.,253
NA,of the observations that have been made about him,253
NA,a very strong coalitionist. In his maiden speech,253
NA,in the Federal coalition and in the New South Wales,253
NA,"I was a member, a very happy and very close",253
NA,which are so important to us.,253
NA,"do not claim to be socialist these days, but I",253
NA,it. He was a person who gave very considerable,253
NA,"in comments from a former leader, Tim",253
NA,the legislative assembly of New South Wales and,253
NA,had given some two decades of dedicated and,253
NA,the member for Lyne had also suffered a horrific,253

NA,have very fond memories of Bruce as a man.,254
NA,"federal parliament, but our relationship",254
NA,Frequently when I went to the Taree or Port,254
NA,so that we could talk about issues. He was keenly,254
NA,up to his very last days.,254
NA,When I attended his funeral service in Taree,254
NA,reminded me of how similar his early life was,254
NA,"way in which we grew up and, I suspect, the",254
NA,Cowan was born on a dairy farm on Oxley Island.,254
NA,has always been hard work. I was also born on,254
NA,"by the time I was born, but all the relics of",254
NA,the Junior Farmers organisation. So did I. That,254
NA,"children, a real opportunity to meet other",254
NA,something about living and working with other,254
NA,"Bruce then went into local government,",254

NA,doing only in the past weeks in support of,254

NA,"My fundamental description of Bruce Cowan,",254
NA,this guy was a gentleman. He was a humble,254
NA,people around him. He endured a great deal of,254

NA,"certainly had his own views, but he was interested",254

NA,Rosemary-the wife of my state parliamentary,254
NA,"Barry O'Farrell-and Mandy, Michael and",254
NA,"of Tom, Will, Sheri, James, Xiao Lian and",254
NA,I miss him. I reflect upon him as a fine former,254
NA,Leader of the House has given us an opportunity,254
NA,(17:36): Like the honourable member,254
NA,parliament has made a little time available for,254
NA,previous speaker would have been in the federal,254
NA,time that Bruce Cowan was a member of this,254
NA,"term, so we crossed over by about three years. I",254
NA,I got to know him briefly before I entered the,254
NA,extended beyond the time of his retirement.,254
NA,Macquarie area he made sure that he was around,254
NA,"interested in politics for all of his life, right",254
NA,and listened to people talk about his life it,254
NA,to my own. I could see many similarities in the,254
NA,sorts of things that led us into politics. Bruce,254
NA,It would have been a battle. Dairy farming,254
NA,a small farm. It had ceased to be a dairy farm,254
NA,the dairy industry were there. He had his start in,254
NA,"later became Rural Youth. It gave us, as farm",254
NA,young people in our district and to understand,254
NA,people and broadening our own experience.,254
NA,as I did. He became Deputy Mayor of Taree City,254
NA,that time he had actually left the farm and was,254
NA,estate business in the town. He was very active,254
NA,issues-and was so all through his life.,254
NA,people talking about the things that he had been,254
NA,"local community organisations, especially the",254
NA,his keen interest in community affairs.,254
NA,"if I had to put it into one word, would be that",254
NA,"man, an able man, a man who cared about the",254
NA,hardship through his own life but always cared,254
NA,always interested in the views of others. He,254
NA,also to hear what other people had to say,254
NA,MAIN COMMITTEE,254
NA,and was very keen to follow through on their concerns.,255
NA,speaking notes-he always spoke without notes,255
NA,notes enabled him to speak more freely than,255
NA,"certainly was a man of substance, but also",255
NA,Bruce is one of the few people to have,255
NA,"mentioned earlier, he was on the Taree council,",255
NA,"New South Wales parliament, where he served",255
NA,moved into the federal parliament. I am,255
NA,"minister in the federal parliament, but that",255
NA,"respect of his colleagues in this place. Indeed,",255
NA,personal foe that he ever really developed,255
NA,generally got on very well with them.,255
NA,I met Bruce Cowan on the very first day I,255
NA,The National Party was in a bit of trouble,255
NA,result. Our leader had been defeated and the,255
NA,to Canberra was to choose a new leader. Bruce,255
NA,Sinclair and felt deeply aggrieved that Ian had,255
NA,to do the right thing and put Ian back as the,255
NA,compassionately for that. His friendship with,255
NA,"death. Indeed, Ian and Rosemary were present",255
NA,state and federal political colleagues,255
NA,In about 1987 his wife Laura was killed in,255
NA,time for the Nationals because at about the,255
NA,lost his wife in a car accident. Both women,255
NA,spouses of members of parliament. It did draw,255
NA,travelling on country roads over very long distances.,255
NA,people who need to be active around our electorates,255
NA,"blow to Bruce, but he later married Jan Churchill",255
NA,was able to help Bruce in his work as an MP,255
NA,The other thing we will always remember,255
NA,"had two daughters, and one, Rosemary, is",255
NA,"Having met Bruce's grandsons, Tom and Will,",255
NA,generations of his family in politics. They,255
NA,also have an enormous contribution to make in the future.,255
NA,Bruce was recognised with an Order of Australia,255
NA,the citizens of the Taree region. He had,255
NA,parliament-a remarkable record. He was a very,255
NA,John's Anglican Church in Taree was one of,255
NA,turned out and his friends were there-and,255
NA,and famous people. But everyone attended,255
NA,because they respected Bruce as a man. They,255
NA,"Taree and district, and those of us who regarded",255
NA,knew him-knew that we had lost someone,255
NA,"sympathies to Jan, and to his daughters Rosemary",255
NA,It is also interesting that he never used,255
NA,and spoke from the heart. Speaking without,255
NA,he otherwise would have been able to do. He,255
NA,he was a man of great warmth and great feeling.,255
NA,served in all three tiers of government. As,255
NA,serving as deputy mayor; he moved into the,255
NA,as a minister under two premiers; and then he,255
NA,sure he would have wished also to have been a,255
NA,"was not to be. Nonetheless, he always had the",255
NA,it would be hard to identify any political or,255
NA,in his life. He respected his opponents and,255
NA,"came to this parliament, at the airport in Sydney.",255
NA,at the time because we had had a bad election,255
NA,first job of new members of parliament coming,255
NA,had always been a lifelong friend of Ian,255
NA,been deposed as leader. He felt that we needed,255
NA,leader of the party. He lobbied strongly and,255
NA,"Ian lasted a very long time, right up to Bruce's",255
NA,"at his funeral, along with a large number of",255
NA,from New South Wales and interstate.,255
NA,a car accident. That was another very difficult,255
NA,"same time Noel Hicks, the member for Riverina,",255
NA,were at the time going about their duties as the,255
NA,to the attention of all of us the dangers of,255
NA,They are the risks that we all take as,255
NA,all the time. Losing Laura was a huge,255
NA,"and Jan, with her wonderful personality,",255
NA,and then right through the rest of his life.,255
NA,was Bruce's dedication and his commitment. He,255
NA,the wife of the new New South Wales Premier.,255
NA,I suspect there may end up being three,255
NA,are a wonderful couple of boys and I am sure they,255
NA,in 1991 for his service to government and,255
NA,"served 35 years in local, state and federal",255
NA,fine man. I felt that his farewell service at St,255
NA,the most impressive I have been to. The town,255
NA,his friends naturally included some well-known,255
NA,not to be in the company of famous people but,255
NA,acknowledged the contribution he had made to,255
NA,him as a friend-virtually everyone who,255
NA,we cherished very deeply. I extend my,255
NA,and Jane and their extended families. They,255

NA,which I would also support.,266
NA,to speak to schedule 5 because it is something,266
NA,since we were in opposition-in,266

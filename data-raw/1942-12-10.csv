NA,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE,11
NA,W ILLIAMHEN RY LAI RD SMITH . members,11
NA,Mr CUKTIir (Fremantle - Prime,11
NA,Minister) - I deeply regret to inform,11
NA,honorable members of the death of the,11
NA,"Honorable William Henry Laird Smith,",11
NA,a former member of the House of Repre-,11
NA,"sentatives and a Minister of the Crown,",11
NA,"whieh occurred at Buwiie, in somewhat",11
NA,"tragic circumstances, on the 21st October,",11
NA,1942.,11
NA,The late honorable gentleman resigned,11
NA,from a position in the Tasmanian Rail-,11
NA,ways Department to contest the Denison,11
NA,seat in the House of Representatives at,11
NA,"the genera] elections in. 1910, in which",11
NA,he was successful. He was re-elected in,11
NA,"1913, 1914, 1917, and 1919. He was a",11
NA,memiber of the parliamentary party that,11
NA,visited England in 1911 at the invitation,11
NA,of the Government of the united Kingdom,11
NA,on the occasion of the coronation of,11
NA,"King George ""V. He was a member of",11
NA,the Royal Commission on Electoral Laws,11
NA,"in 1914, and of the Public Works Com-",11
NA,mittee from 1914 to 1916 and again from,11
NA,1917 to 1919. He was an Assistant,11
NA,"Minister from November, 1916, to Feb-",11
NA,"ruary, 1917, and an Honorary Minister",11
NA,"from the 3rd February, 1920. He held",11
NA,the portfolio of Minister for the Navy,11
NA,"from the 28th July, 1920, to the 21st",11
NA,"December, 1921. He was defeated at the",11
NA,general election in 1922.,11
NA,Mr Laird Smith subsequently took up,11
NA,farming pursuits in the Burnie district,11
NA,and continued to take an active interest,11
NA,"in public affairs, particularly in relation",11
NA,to the organization of primary industries.,11
NA,He took a leading part in the formation,11
NA,of the now defunct Agricultural Bureau,11
NA,"of Tasmania, and became the first chair-",11
NA,man of tho State Potato Marketing,11
NA,Board. He was also prominent in other,11
NA,public movements. He worked unspar-,11
NA,ingly in the service of his country and,11
NA,was held in the highest esteem by his,11
NA,fellows. T move-,11
NA,That this House records its sincere regret,11
NA,at the death of the Honorable William Henry,11
NA,"Laird Smith, a former member of the House",11
NA,of Representatives for the Division of Denison,11
NA,"and a Minister of the Grown, places on record",11
NA,its appreciation of his meritorious public,11
NA,"service, and tenders its deep sympathy to",11
NA,his widow and adopted sou.,11
Mr HUGHES ,North Sydney-Leade r,11
NA,of the United Australia party) - I,11
NA,second the motion and associate the,11
NA,of the Opposition and myself,11
NA,with the Prime Minister's expressions of,11
NA,deep Tegret at the death of the late,11
NA,"Honorable W. H . Laird Smith, and of",11
NA,profound sympathy with his widow and,11
NA,adopted son.,11
NA,The news of his death came as a great,11
NA,shock to me. During all the years we,11
NA,were associated I never knew 'him to,11
NA,be i l l ; he always seemed to me to be,11
NA,the embodiment of radiant health.,12
NA,"Physically, he was a magnificent speci-",12
NA,men of manhood. Of all the men I have,12
NA,known in public life he seemed to me the,12
NA,one destined to outlive his contem-,12
NA,poraries.,12
NA,"He was my colleague for many years,",12
NA,and I entertained for him feelings of pro-,12
NA,found esteem and warm affection. I n,12
NA,"and out of office, I found him to be",12
NA,honorable and upright. He was a forth-,12
NA,right man-on e who spoke his mind,12
NA,freelyHe held definite opinions which,12
NA,he did not fear to declare to the world.,12
NA,"What he believed in he fought for, and",12
NA,he never feared to speak his mind. His,12
NA,character may be summed up in the,12
NA,"phrase-""H e faced life boldly"".",12
NA,Mr Laird Smith was as firm in his,12
NA,friendships as he was in his beliefs. He,12
NA,was no fair-weather friend; but a man,12
NA,"who, in the darkest hour when the storm",12
NA,"raged fiercely, was ever at one's side. He",12
NA,had a genial disposition. He made no,12
NA,personal enemies. Although he met life,12
NA,boldly he met it with a smile. He was,12
NA,a very manly man. There was nothing,12
NA,petty or mean about him. I n and out of,12
NA,Parliament he served his country faith-,12
NA,"fully and with great ability. His death,",12
NA,which will be deeply regretted by the,12
NA,"people of hig State, robs me of a dear",12
NA,"friend, whose loss I sincerely mourn.",12

NA,REVIEW OF WAR SITUATION.,12
NA,MT. CURTIN (Fremantle - Prime,12
NA,Minister) -b y leave-Whe n the House,12
NA,adjourned on the 9th October I stated,12
NA,that the Government proposed to call,12
NA,Parliament together before Christmas.,12
NA,"I added that, if the war situation necessi-",12
NA,"tated it, an early sitting would be held.",12
NA,"As I announced on the 13th November, it",12
NA,was decided to summon Parliament for a,12
NA,"meeting extending over two days, in order",12
NA,that honorable members might hear and,12
NA,discuss a statement on the position of the,12
NA,"war. As stated at the time, it is not the",12
NA,intention of the Government to submit,12
NA,any legislative proposals to Parliament.,12
NA,I now propose to give to honorable mem-,12
NA,bers a brief review of the important de-,12
NA,velopments which have taken place i n the,12
NA,war situation since the House last met.,12
NA,The battle to drive the Japanese back,12
NA,over the Owen Stanley Range and out of,12
NA,the south-eastern part of New Guinea has,12
NA,been fought in one of tbe most difficult,12
NA,campaigning areas in the world. The ter-,12
NA,rain has been described by General,12
NA,"MACArthur as "" incredibly difficult"" and",12
NA,"presenting "" almost insuperable complica-",12
NA,"tions in the maintenance of supply lines "".",12
NA,The Australian and United States forces,12
NA,have had to endure extreme hardships in,12
NA,one of the worst tropical climates. I n,12
NA,addition to the strain imposed by the,12
NA,"nature of the country and climate, these",12
NA,troops have had to withstand the inci-,12
NA,"dence of malaria, though every endeavour",12
NA,h made to minimize the risk of thi.*,12
NA,"illness. Finally, -under conditions to",12
NA,which white men do not readily become,12
NA,"inured, these troops have had to fight",12
NA,against no mean foe. Nevertheless -the,12
NA,"allied troops have fought tenaciously, gal-",12
NA,"lantly, and, most important of all, vic-",12
NA,toriously. I pay a tribute to these men,12
NA,"and totobeirdistinguished leaders, General",12
NA,"MACArthur, Commander-in-Chief, South-",12
NA,"west Pacific area; General Blamey, Com-",12
NA,mander of the Allied Land Forces; and,12
NA,"General Kenney, Commander of the",12
NA,"Allied Air Forces. To them, to the sub-",12
NA,"ordinate commanders, and to the officers",12
NA,and men of the Australian and United,12
NA,"States forces, Australia owes a debt of",12
NA,gratitude.,12
NA,I have said on an earlier occasion that,12
NA,Moresby is a vital key-point in the,12
NA,defence of Australia against an attack,12
NA,from the north-east where the main Jap-,12
NA,anese bases lie. Its possession by the,12
NA,"enemy would open the way for a direct,",12
NA,attack on the mainland of Australia. The,12
NA,landward defence line of Port Moresbj,12
NA,is tbe Owen Stanley Range. The Jap-,12
NA,anese first made an effort to turn its left,12
NA,"flank from Lae and Salamaua, but this",12
NA,was unsuccessful. They then launched a,12
NA,"sea-borne attack against its rear, but this",12
NA,was repulsed by the Battle of the Coral,12
NA,Sea. A frontal attack was then attempted,12
NA,"by way of Buna, Gona and Kokoda, but",12
NA,this had largely spent inself by the time,12
NA,it had reached Ioribaiwa. The next effort,12
NA,of tbe enemy was an attempt to turn the,12
NA,right flank by a surprise attack at Milne,12
NA,"Bay, but this move had been anticipated,",13
NA,and was frustrated. Provided the flank,13
NA,our defence line in New Guinea is not,13
NA,turned by the southward advance of the,13
NA,Japanese in the other islands to the east,13
NA,"of Australia, the Owen Stanley Range",13
NA,remains the front line defence of eastern,13
NA,Australia. We have experienced fluctu-,13
NA,ating fortunes in the land campaign in,13
NA,New Guinea. I n the early stages the,13
NA,"fight went against us, and there wen",13
NA,many criticisms of the commanders' con-,13
NA,duct of the operations. The results pro-,13
NA,"vide a complete answer, but there are",13
NA,one or two aspects of the operations to,13
NA,which I shall refer.,13
NA,"First, the operations at Milne Bay.",13
NA,Plans had been drawn up by the High,13
NA,Command for the establishment of a,13
NA,strongly defended base at Milne Bay long,13
NA,before the Japanese landed at Gona and,13
NA,Buna. Tbe High Command had anti-,13
NA,"cipated the Japanese attack on Milne Bay,",13
NA,and when it came we were ready. A few,13
NA,days of sharp fighting brought a com-,13
NA,plete Australian victory. The Japanese,13
NA,evacuated such of their surviving forces,13
NA,"as they could, while the remnants scat-",13
NA,tered in the jungle and have since been,13
NA,mopped up. The success of this operation,13
NA,lay in the absolute secrecy that was,13
NA,ensured in the movement of forces to this,13
NA,area. The Government was fully aware,13
NA,of the move. I t was known also to,13
NA,members of the Advisory War Council.,13
NA,The second aspect is the counter-,13
NA,offensive against the Japanese. Prior to,13
NA,the launching of our attack from Iori-,13
NA,"baiwa towards the end of September, we",13
NA,had marshalled considerable forces in,13
NA,New Guinea. Actually we had more than,13
NA,doubled the strength of the land forces,13
NA,that were there in the early stages of the,13
NA,campaign. There had also been a trans-,13
NA,"formation in air strength, amounting to",13
NA,multiplication of air forces and aero-,13
NA,"dromes. All of this was, of course, highly",13
NA,secret information. The High Command,13
NA,had drawn up plans for an outflanking,13
NA,"movement against the Japanese, and bases",13
NA,were established on the north-eastern,13
NA,"coast of New Guinea, to which American",13
NA,troops in considerable strength were,13
NA,transported by air. These troops attacked,13
NA,"Buna from the right, whilst other",13
NA,American units joined up with Aus-,13
NA,Mr Cwrtin.,13
NA,tralian troops in a frontal.assault. Con-,13
NA,"of currently with this, Australian forces",13
NA,attacked Gona. These plans had been,13
NA,formulated before the critics had voiced,13
NA,"their opinions, and, while they were urg-",13
NA,"ing outflanking movements and the like,",13
NA,the High Command was pushing ahead,13
NA,with its preparations. As Mr Churchill,13
NA,"recently explained, it takes considerable",13
NA,time to marshal forces and supplies to,13
NA,mount an offensive. What may appear,13
NA,to be a period of inaction is really one of,13
NA,intense activity covered by a veil of,13
NA,secrecy.,13
NA,"I n actual fact, had two brigades of the",13
NA,"Sixth Division, Australian Imperial",13
NA,"Force, not been diverted - to the defence",13
NA,of Ceylon on their way home from the,13
NA,"Middle East, the Commander-in-Chief",13
NA,would have had these additional resources,13
NA,of battle-trained troops for the defence of,13
NA,New Guinea. Australian troops were the,13
NA,onlv forces readily available to meet a,13
NA,critical situation in the defence of a,13
NA,vital base in the Indian Ocean. The,13
NA,Government readily agreed to the request,13
NA,and the Advisory War Council endorsed,13
NA,the decision. The full facts of the posi-,13
NA,tion could not be disclosed at the time,13
NA,without prejudicing our own interests,13
NA,and benefiting those of the enemy.,13
NA,I would make these observations: I t,13
NA,is a misrepresentation of the spirit of,13
NA,the Australian people and the Anzac,13
NA,tradition to cry out when things appear,13
NA,to be going against us. I t is premature,13
NA,for critics to rush in and criticize a phase,13
NA,of an operation as though it were the,13
NA,whole campaign that was being decided.,13
NA,The Government has all the facts before,13
NA,it. I f it is dissatisfied with the com-,13
NA,"manders, it will take appropriate action.",13
NA,"Unless and until that position arises, it",13
NA,will place the fullest confidence in tbe,13
NA,"commanders and the troops under them,",13
NA,and give them the utmost support against,13
NA,ill-informed or unwarranted criticism.,13
NA,After the Australian troops had pushed,13
NA,the Japanese out of Ioribaiwa they con-,13
NA,tinued their advance without making con-,13
NA,tact with the enemy for ten days. The,13
NA,"difficulty of communications, which had",13
NA,so greatly hampered us in the early,13
NA,stages in maintaining supplies and rein-,13
NA,"forcements for the forward areas, also",13
NA,proved a stumbling block to the enemy.,13
NA,General MACArthur expressed the posire-establish,14
NA,tion as follows in his communique of the,14
NA,8th October:-,14
NA,"The enemy, as we expected and anticipated,",14
NA,"bas discovered that his supply problems,",14
NA,"vated by our constant air attacks, were",14
NA,possible of immediate solution. His dislodg-,14
NA,ment at his farthest point of advance and,14
NA,pursuit of his exhausted forces have been,14
NA,accomplished with practically no loss to,14
NA,troops up to the present time. The same,14
NA,difficulties of terrain are now progressively the sick.,14
NA,slowing down the advance of our ground,14
NA,troops.,14
NA,The Japanese put up some resistance,14
NA,"in the area of Templeton's Crossing, Eora",14
NA,"Creek and Alola, but this was overcome,",14
NA,after stiff fighting. Kokoda was taken on,14
NA,the 2nd November with little or no oppo-,14
NA,"sition, but the enemy again endeavoured",14
NA,"to halt our advance at Oivi, Gorari and",14
NA,Wairope. He was pushed out of these,14
NA,places and heavy losses were inflicted by,14
NA,Australian troops. I have just received,14
NA,advice - from the General Officer Com-,14
NA,manding that allied forces have com-,14
NA,pletely occupied the Gona area and that,14
NA,tbe Japanese are now pinned down in a,14
NA,narrow coastal strip in the Buna area.,14
NA,Allied air forces are maintaining con-,14
NA,tinuous bombing and strafing attacks,14
NA,upon enemy ground troops and the enemy,14
NA,air base at Lae. The Japanese have,14
NA,made frequent attempts to land rein-,14
NA,forcements. Many of them have been,14
NA,"repulsed by allied air forces, which have",14
NA,taken a heavy toll of enemy naval forces,14
NA,"and shipping. I t is known, however, that",14
NA,some attempts made under cover of dark-,14
NA,"ness, and in weather conditions unfavor-",14
NA,able for the effective employment of our,14
NA,"aircraft, have been successful. The",14
NA,"Japanese, operating in prepared defence",14
NA,"positions, are resisting stubbornly, but",14
NA,Australian and American troops are,14
NA,gradually pressing home the attack.,14
NA,This operation has been notable for,14
NA,the manner in which it has been achieved.,14
NA,The original occupation of Gona and New Guinea.,14
NA,Buna was rendered possible because of,14
NA,Japanese control of the sea to the north,14
NA,of New Guinea. I n the absence of,14
NA,"allied sea-power in this region, our",14
NA,vance has been overland and by air. Now,14
NA,that we have aerodromes on the northern,14
NA,"side of the Owen Stanley Range, i t",14
NA,mains to be seen whether the enemy is,14
NA,prepared to risk heavy losses against,14
NA,land-based aircraft in an endeavour,14
NA,himself again in this region.,14
NA,The Australian Army battle casualties in,14
NA,"New Guinea, excluding Rabaul, to the",14
NA,"1st December were 2,190, of whom 640",14
NA,aggrawere killed in action or died of wounds.,14
NA,imThe figures do not include the sick. I,14
NA,the speak for the whole Parliament when I,14
NA,offer the tribute of the nation to those,14
NA,our who gave their lives in its defence. The,14
NA,same gratitude is due to the wounded and,14
NA,There has been increased enemy activity,14
NA,"in Timor, and allied air forces have",14
NA,maintained bombing attacks on enemy,14
NA,occupied areas in this island. Successful,14
NA,raids have been made on enemy aero-,14
NA,"dromes, supply installations and barracks",14
NA,"at Dilli and enemy occupied villages, and",14
NA,also at Koepang. Last week's daylight,14
NA,raid on the aerodrome at Koepang had,14
NA,excellent results. The enemy was taken,14
NA,"by surprise and 21 of his aircraft, caught",14
NA,"on the ground, were damaged or des-",14
NA,troyed. Japanese aircraft raided Darwin,14
NA,three times during the last week of,14
NA,November. The raids were made at,14
NA,night and little damage was caused.,14
NA,Our guerrilla forces in Timor have,14
NA,been doing bold and courageous work.,14
NA,Though the spotlight has been more on,14
NA,New Guinea because of the larger forces,14
NA,"engaged, the people of Australia should",14
NA,not overlook the importance of Timor as,14
NA,a base for operations against the north-,14
NA,west of Australia. Timor is the counter-,14
NA,part in the north-west of New Guinea,14
NA,in the north-east. Known Japanese dis-,14
NA,positions and movements of their forces,14
NA,indicate that the enemy realizes this fact,14
NA,equally with ourselves. We must be pre-,14
NA,pared to repulse all air and sea-borne,14
NA,attacks against Australia from this,14
NA,quarter. I t is equally important that,14
NA,when the time comes we should be ready,14
NA,and able to eject the Japanese from theix,14
NA,bases in this region as much as from,14
NA,The severe naval defeat inflicted by,14
NA,the American forces on the Japanese in,14
NA,adtbe middle of November frustrated a,14
NA,determined attempt to recapture Guadal-,14
NA,"canal. Like the Coral Sea battle, it was",14
NA,rea victory which had great significance,14
NA,"for the security of Australia, and I ex-",14
NA,our pressed to the President of the United,14
NA,to States of America tbe admiration and,14
NA,gratitude of the Australian people for,15
NA,the gallant deeds of the American forces.,15
NA,The Japanese have sought to exploit,15
NA,two lines of advance from bases at Rabaul,15
NA,and other centres in this region of the,15
NA,"Pacific. One was against New Guinea,",15
NA,which has been several times frustrated-,15
NA,in the attempted advance from Lae and,15
NA,"Salamaua, in the Coral .Sea battle, at",15
NA,"Milne Bay, and in the counter-offensive",15
NA,over the Owen Stanley range. The other,15
NA,thmst has been the attempt to advance,15
NA,through the .Solomons to islands in the,15
NA,Pacific in order to secure bases nearer to,15
NA,tbe American line of communication,15
NA,across the Pacific. This would also,15
NA,assist in isolating Australia and would,15
NA,turn the flank of our position in New,15
NA,Guinea.,15
NA,The importance of the Solomon Islands,15
NA,to the Japanese plan will be evident from,15
NA,the heavy price they are prepared to pa.y,15
NA,for the recapture of the footholds secured,15
NA,"by the Americans. The enemy is, of",15
NA,"course, still powerful, for he has naval,",15
NA,land and air forces of considerable,15
NA,"strength. As he is a determined foe,",15
NA,we can expect that he will come again.,15
NA,The Americans have demonstrated a,15
NA,"superiority on land, sea, and in the air",15
NA,and a capacity to reinforce their forces,15
NA,"at Guadalcanal, which, it is hoped, is a",15
NA,good omen for tbe ultimate result of the,15
NA,conflict in the South Pacific Area.,15
NA,There has recently been some public,15
NA,discussion in the press of the United,15
NA,Nations on two questions:-,15
NA,(i) The machinery for operational,15
NA,control in the Pacific;,15
NA,(ii) The flow of forces to the South-,15
NA,west Pacific Area.,15
NA,"The grand strategy for the whole war,",15
NA,insofar as the British Empire and the,15
NA,"United States of America are concerned,",15
NA,is determined by the Combined British,15
NA,"and American Chiefs of Staff in ""Wash-",15
NA,ington. They are responsible to Mr.,15
NA,Churchill and President Roosevelt. The,15
NA,Pacific Ocean is a zone of American,15
NA,"strategic responsibility, and is divided",15
NA,"into several areas, each of which is under",15
NA,an American commander. In the case,15
NA,"of the South-west Pacific Area, which",15
NA,"includes Australia, the Government, with",15
NA,tbe concurrence of the Advisory War,15
NA,"Council, agreed to a set-up under which",15
NA,JIfr. Curtin.,15
NA,General MACArthur is the Supreme,15
NA,Commander. He is responsible for,15
NA,operational strategy to the Chief of Staff,15
NA,of the United States of America Army,15
NA,as the. executive agency for the Joint,15
NA,United States of America Chiefs of,15
NA,Staff. The directive issued to General,15
NA,MACArthur and agreed to by the Aus-,15
NA,tralian Government specifies the objec-,15
NA,tives which his operations will be,15
NA,designed to accomplish. I n fulfilment,15
NA,of the commitments accepted under this,15
NA,"directive, the Australian Government",15
NA,assigned to the command of General,15
NA,MACArthur the combat forces of the,15
NA,"Australian Navy, Army, and A i r Eorce.",15
NA,[ make i t clear that tliere is the closest,15
NA,and most harmonious co-operation be-,15
NA,tween the Commander-in-Chief and my-,15
NA,self as head of the Australian Govern-,15
NA,ment. There is also close and effective,15
NA,co-operation between the Commanders,15
NA,of the South-west and South Pacific,15
NA,Areas. This is demonstrated by General,15
NA,MACArthur's communiques on the opera-,15
NA,tions of his aircraft in the South Pacific,15
NA,"Area, and by the presence of H.M.A.S.",15
NA,"Canberra iu that region, when i t was",15
NA,unfortunately sunk.,15
NA,When the Australian Government,15
NA,"agreed to this unique set-up, under which",15
NA,it surrendered a part of its sovereignty,15
NA,and placed its defence forces under the,15
NA,control of a commander of an allied,15
NA,"uarion, it did so, of'Course, on the clear",15
NA,understanding that its action would facili-,15
NA,tate the achievement of two results:-,15
NA,"First, there would Ibe unified direction of",15
NA,the operations in the South-west Pacific,15
NA,Area under an American commander;,15
NA,"and, secondly, the Australian Govern-",15
NA,"ment, having placed its military re-",15
NA,"sources under this commander, would",15
NA,have made the maximum contribution of,15
NA,which it was capable towards the achieve-,15
NA,ment of the objectives laid down in the,15
NA,directive for the South-west Pacific Area.,15
NA,"Having done so, it would have every",15
NA,right to expect that any additional,15
NA,strength required would be furnished,15
NA,from other sources.,15
NA,This view was based on no selfish,15
NA,motives. I t was dictated by the stra-,15
NA,tegical needs of a war with Japan. I t,15
NA,was warranted by the co-operation which,15
NA,"Australian naval, land, and air forces had",15
NA,given in other theatres of war.,15
NA,"I explained, in some detail, at the last",16
NA,"secret session, the exchanges of views that",16
NA,"had passed between. Mir. Churchill, Presi-",16
NA,"dent Roosevelt, and myself on Pacific",16
NA,"strategy, and the needs of the South-west",16
NA,Pacific Area in particular. Mr Churchill,16
NA,and President Roosevelt were unable,16
NA,fully to accept the views of the Australian,16
NA,"Government on Pacific strategy, and the",16
NA,provision of the forces and supplies,16
NA,"sought. However, they gave certain",16
NA,"assurances and practical support, for",16
NA,"which the Government is deeply grateful,",16
NA,and it felt bound to accept their conclu-,16
NA,sions in a spirit of united comradeship.,16
NA,The essential question confronting the,16
NA,Combined Chiefs of Staff in Washington,16
NA,is how the war can be most vigorously,16
NA,"waged on all fronts, and the resources of",16
NA,the United Nations disposed to bring,16
NA,about the speedy and certain defeat of,16
NA,the enemy. The landings in the French,16
NA,"colonies in North Africa, which .entail",16
NA,"large demands on these resources, have",16
NA,now been publicly explained by the Presi-,16
NA,dent as having been based on a decision,16
NA,reached by Mr Churchill and himself,16
NA,during Mr Churchill's visit to America,16
NA,at the end of last year. A t the time that,16
NA,the President and Mr Churchill reached,16
NA,"their decision to defeat Germany first,",16
NA,the transformation had not come over the,16
NA,Pacific situation by the loss of the,16
NA,"Philippines, Singapore, and the Nether-",16
NA,lands East Indies. We should therefore,16
NA,not lose sight of the significance for us in,16
NA,Australia of the predictions of Mr.,16
NA,"Churchill, during his broadcast of the",16
NA,"29 th November, on the duration and",16
NA,course of the war. Notwithstanding,16
NA,the concentration of Anglo-American,16
NA,strength against the Axis powers' in,16
NA,"Europe, Mr Churchill said-",16
NA,I know nothing that has happened yet which,16
NA,justifies the hope tbat the war w i l l not,16
NA,or that bloody years w i l l not lie ahead.,16
NA,Predicting that the war in Europe may,16
NA,"end -before the war in the Pacific, he",16
NA,brings out clearly the significance of the,16
NA,warning in my own broadcast on the 4th,16
NA,October-,16
NA,"Australia, therefore, has the task of holding",16
NA,the enemy until the potential becomes the,16
NA,reality and we can strike with all the punching,16
NA,power of the United Nations. U n t i l that day,16
NA,"comes, we must hang grimly on.",16
NA,"I n Libya, the Eighth Army is now in",16
NA,contact with Rommel's forces near El-,16
NA,Agheila. When plans were laid for the,16
NA,offensive against Rommel's position at El,16
NA,"Alamein, the fact was recognized that it",16
NA,would he necessary to make a direct fron-,16
NA,"tal assault on those positions, and that",16
NA,this might involve protracted fighting and,16
NA,heavy casualties. After twelve days of,16
NA,"bitter combat, the German forces, who for",16
NA,once proved swifter than their Italian,16
NA,comrades in reaching the available trans-,16
NA,"port, were in full flight, leaving the hulk",16
NA,of the Italians to their fate. The Aus-,16
NA,tralian Ninth Division played an out-,16
NA,"standing part in this battle, and Mr.",16
NA,"Churchill and President Roosevelt, in",16
NA,"congratulatory messages to me, have both",16
NA,generously acknowledged the distin-,16
NA,guished services rendered by the Aus-,16
NA,tralian troops. I t will be recalled that,16
NA,Mr Churchill announced that the total,16
NA,casualties sustained by the British and,16
NA,"Allied Forces were 13,600 officers and",16
NA,"men. The Ninth Division lost 2,740, of",16
NA,whom 620 were killed in action or died,16
NA,of wounds. To these men who have,16
NA,fought in distant countries for the de-,16
NA,"fence of their homeland, we pay the same",16
NA,tribute as we do to their comrades in,16
NA,arms who have defended their country in,16
NA,New Guinea and in other parts of the,16
NA,South-west Pacific Area -,16
NA,Following closely on the victory of the,16
NA,"Eighth Army in Egypt, the allied land-",16
NA,ings in French North Africa have exerted,16
NA,fresh pressure on the enemy. This new,16
NA,campaign has compelled Hitler to divert,16
NA,troops and aircraft to the defence of,16
NA,Bizerta and Tunis. I t has also forced,16
NA,"him to move into unoccupied France, and",16
NA,has deprived him of his final hope of,16
NA,securing the French Fleet for the Axis.,16
NA,"Although not a second front in Europe, it",16
NA,"has, in President Roosevelt's words, pro-",16
NA,"be long vided "" effective second-front assistance",16
NA,"for our heroic ally, Russia "", and its effect",16
NA,in relieving pressure on the Russian front,16
NA,should be considerable. We look forward,16
NA,to the time when the allied drives from,16
NA,east and west will achieve the final ex-,16
NA,pulsion of the Axis from the African,16
NA,"continent. When that is done, the United",16
NA,Nations will have fresh bases for offen-,16
NA,"sive action against the enemy, and",16
NA,especially against Italy. As M . Stalin,16
NA,"has said, the allied campaign in Africa",16
NA,""" demonstrates the growing might of the",16
NA,allied armed forces and opens up a pros-,17
NA,pect of the disintegration of the Italian,17
NA,and German coalition in the very near,17
NA,"future "".",17
NA,The magnificent fight by the Russians,17
NA,is one of the inspiring things of this war.,17
NA,Attacked when the Germans were at the,17
NA,height of their military power and able,17
NA,to concentrate their forces on a single,17
NA,"front, the Russians have heroically with-",17
NA,stood tremendous enemy pressure through,17
NA,two hitter campaigns. They suffered,17
NA,"immense territorial losses, hut the",17
NA,Russian armies were not destroyed.,17
NA,Hitler underestimated Russian powers of,17
NA,recuperation and the strength of Russia's,17
NA,"reserves, and our gallant ally is now",17
NA,striking back fiercely against the invader.,17
NA,Air activity on the Western Front con-,17
NA,tinues. Whilst the British heavy bombing,17
NA,raids have recently been directed more at,17
NA,"Italy than formerly, Germany and Ger-",17
NA,man-occupied parts in France have re-,17
NA,ceived their share. New types of aircraft,17
NA,"and new and heavier bombs up to 8,000",17
NA,lb. in weight are being employed. Ameri-,17
NA,can bombers are taking an ever-increasing,17
NA,part in raids over the Continent. The,17
NA,"heavy raids on Genoa, Milan and Turin,",17
NA,which have been achieved with excep-,17
NA,"tionally low casualties on our side, are",17
NA,a foretaste of what Italy may expect,17
NA,when the occupation of the North A f r,17
NA,can coastline is complete. Australian,17
NA,Empire Air Training Scheme squadrons,17
NA,"are participating in these raids, whilst",17
NA,"the Australian Sundei'land Squadron,",17
NA,"based on Britain, is operating effectively",17
NA,for the protection of shipping and offen-,17
NA,sive patrols against U-boats. Our fighter,17
NA,squadron in the Middle East has con-,17
NA,tinued to add to its great reputation.,17
NA,Despite acute economic difficulties and,17
NA,"supply problems, the Chinese people con-",17
NA,tinue their resistance to the Japanese. In,17
NA,"Central China, the Chinese armies have",17
NA,reoccupied the territory which was occu-,17
NA,pied by the Japanese in June and July.,17
NA,A notable feature of recent fighting has,17
NA,"been the work of the American air force,",17
NA,"which has attacked, with success, enemy",17
NA,"aerodromes, troop concentrations and",17
NA,shipping. Attacks on shipping are par-,17
NA,ticularly important in view of the increas-,17
NA,ing evidence of a Japanese shortage of,17
NA,shipping tonnage.,17
NA,ilr. Curtin.,17
NA,"As honorable members know, I for-",17
NA,warded a message to Generalissimo,17
NA,Chiang Kai-Shek; on the occasion of the,17
NA,first anniversary of the outbreak of the,17
NA,"Pacific War, in which I conveyed to him",17
NA,our deep appreciation of the courage and,17
NA,tenacity with which the Chinese armed,17
NA,forces and civil population have resisted,17
NA,the Japanese aggressors for so many,17
NA,"years, and our confidence in the power",17
NA,"and determination of China, under his",17
NA,"leadership, to wage this war to a success-",17
NA,ful conclusion.,17
NA,The strategic position of Madagascar,17
NA,has always made it a matter of special,17
NA,interest to Australia that i t should not,17
NA,be permitted to come under enemy con-,17
NA,trol. The renewed military operations in,17
NA,"the island, which were rendered necessary",17
NA,by the refusal of the local authorities to,17
NA,allow proper measures to be taken to deny,17
NA,"the use of the island to the Axis, were",17
NA,successfully concluded early in November.,17
NA,The occupation by the Fighting French,17
NA,"of Reunion, which lies between Mada-",17
NA,"gascar and. Mauritius, will further",17
NA,strengthen tbe position in the western,17
NA,Indian Ocean.,17
NA,Shipping continues to be a grave prob-,17
NA,lem. Whilst we look forward to a steady,17
NA,increase in the flow of new tonnage from,17
NA,the shipbuilding yards of tbe United,17
NA,"Nations, i t must be remembered, as Mr.",17
NA,"i - Churchill has recently pointed out, that",17
NA,the U-boat war is not diminishing but,17
NA,"growing. Moreover, the offensive phase",17
NA,of our strategy creates extremely heavy,17
NA,demands for sea transport. I n our,17
NA,"waters, there has been reduced submarine",17
NA,activity and the Australian and Ameri-,17
NA,can naval forces in the South-west Paci-,17
NA,fic area have been continuing their,17
NA,effective work. Enemy submarines have,17
NA,"been active in the Indian Ocean and, as",17
NA,"announced, surface raiders and supply",17
NA,ships have been sunk. Our shipping posi-,17
NA,"tion is that, in addition to our increased",17
NA,"war-time industrial requirements, we",17
NA,have had to divert ships from normal,17
NA,services to cope with increased military,17
NA,requirements. This has placed a severe,17
NA,strain on our limited transport facilities.,17
NA,The Government has had some success,17
NA,in its endeavours to secure additional,17
NA,"shipping from overseas sources, - and our",17
NA,own shipbuilding programme will be of,17
NA,material assistance; but the position is,17
NA,still acute. I n order to ensure that the,18
NA,maximum use is made of the shipping,18
NA,"actually available, it was recently decided",18
NA,"to establish a new department, known as",18
NA,"the Department of Supply and Shipping,",18
NA,which brings under a single co-ordinated,18
NA,direction the various agencies which are,18
NA,concerned with the control of shipping.,18
NA,Australia has much to be thankful for.,18
NA,We have felt the impact of enemy bombs,18
NA,on a number of our northern towns and,18
NA,"Sydney has been attacked, but we have",18
NA,been spared the horror of the devastation,18
NA,of war on our own soil. The victories,18
NA,"won at Coral Sea, Midway Island and",18
NA,in the Solomons were of crucial impor-,18
NA,tance to us. There should be throughout,18
NA,the whole continent a universal feeling,18
NA,of deep gratitude and thanksgiving for,18
NA,what we have so far been spared. Origi-,18
NA,"nally, Britain stood alone between Ger-",18
NA,many and the world. Later the gallant,18
NA,Russian people withstood the full might,18
NA,of the German military machine. Re-,18
NA,"cently, it has been American sea-power",18
NA,which has been the shield between Japan,18
NA,and Australia.,18
NA,The immunity frbm attack which we,18
NA,have enjoyed has enabled our war pro-,18
NA,duction programme to proceed unhin-,18
NA,dered. Our greatly improved defensive,18
NA,position has made it possible to relax in,18
NA,some measure the air raid precautions,18
NA,"originally imposed, but constant vigil-",18
NA,ance and perfection of their training and,18
NA,preparations should be the aim of the,18
NA,Home Security Services.,18
NA,The production of war material of all,18
NA,"kinds has greatly increased, so much so",18
NA,that it has now been thought desirable to,18
NA,set up in Australia machinery for the,18
NA,allocation of Australian munitions pro-,18
NA,duction similar to that which exists in,18
NA,the United Kingdom and the United,18
NA,"States. This does not mean, of course,",18
NA,that there is a surplus of all classes of,18
NA,munitions in this country. I t does indi-,18
NA,"cate, however, that our output of many",18
NA,kinds of munitions is sufficiently,18
NA,justify the extension to Australian pro-,18
NA,duction of the pooling arrangements,18
NA,agreed upon between Mr Churchill and,18
NA,"President Roosevelt in January last, with",18
NA,respect to British and American pro-,18
NA,duction.,18
NA,In some items of munitions we are,18
NA,within measurable distance of fulfilling,18
NA,the whole of the needs of the Australian,18
NA,"forces. But, as fast as one requirement",18
NA,"is fulfilled, other demands arise and must",18
NA,be met. We are faced with problems,18
NA,associated with the re-allocation of pro-,18
NA,"ductive capacity, and it will he necessary",18
NA,to divert our technical resources and,18
NA,skilled man-power from projects which,18
NA,have been fulfilled or whose completion is,18
NA,"in sight, to other high priority projects.",18
NA,"I n doing this, the Government will - be",18
NA,guided by the advice of its service and,18
NA,"technical advisers, which will, of course,",18
NA,-be related to the plan of operations for,18
NA,the South-west Pacific area. Tbe primary,18
NA,concern of the whole nation must be to,18
NA,supply the needs of our fighting men.,18
NA,This will be the essential consideration,18
NA,which will govern the allotment of man-,18
NA,"power, including women, and use of our",18
NA,material and financial resources.,18
NA,As to the prospects for the future and,18
NA,"the duration of the struggle, I would",18
NA,remind every Australian of the,18
NA,basis on which Mr Churchill,18
NA,reached his conclusion that there is,18
NA,nothing to justify an optimistic view that,18
NA,the end is in sight. He referred to an,18
NA,enslaved Europe with all its resources,18
NA,at Germany's disposal. He pointed out,18
NA,that the Eighth Army in Africa had,18
NA,defeated only a few divisions of Ger-,18
NA,many's great army. He mentioned that,18
NA,"the U-boat menace is not diminishing,",18
NA,but growing. So much for the task of,18
NA,"defeating Germany, but what about",18
NA,"Japan? I t , too, is master of vast terri-",18
NA,tories with large populations and vital,18
NA,resources for the waging of war. Though,18
NA,Japan has suffered certain naval and air,18
NA,"losses, its strength is still great. Like",18
NA,"Germany, Japan prepared for this war",18
NA,for years and did not strike until it was,18
NA,ready to do so and considered the situa-,18
NA,tion favorable for success. I t should not,18
NA,be overlooked that we are fighting the,18
NA,enemy at places vital to our own security,18
NA,and far removed from his own final ram-,18
NA,large to parts of defence.,18
NA,We must realize that we are up against,18
NA,a powerful fighting machine. I t is backed,18
NA,by a people whose training and discipline,18
NA,produce a national morale which will-,18
NA,"ingly accepts the utmost sacrifice, includ-",18
NA,"ing death itself, for the national cause.",18
NA,Such a race can be beaten only by actual,18
NA,"physical defeat. We, therefore, must be",18
NA,prepared to make such sacrifices for vic-,19
NA,tory as will enable us to match and over-,19
NA,come a foe so thoroughly trained to the,19
NA,needs of total war. This is tbe prescrip-,19
NA,tion for victory which I adjure all Aus-,19
NA,tralians to observe.,19
NA,I lay on the table the following,19
NA,paper:-,19
NA,Review of War Situation-Ministeria l state-,19
NA,"ment, 10th December, 1942.",19
NA,and move -,19
NA,That the paper be printed.,19
Mr FADDEN ,Darling Downs-Leade r,19
NA,of the Opposition) [3.43] -Th e specific,19
NA,reason why Parliament has been called is,19
NA,together for this two days' sitting was,19
NA,hear the statement which honorable memany,19
NA,bers have just been privileged to hear,19
NA,from the Prime Minister ( Mr Curtin).,19
NA,That statement sets out the problems,19
NA,which the Government considered should,19
NA,be placed before honorable members as,19
NA,the trustees of the people of Australia.,19
NA,Consequently the House was entitled,19
NA,believe that the contents of the statement,19
NA,would set out the major problems that,19
NA,are confronting the Government to-day. tance,19
NA,"On that assessment, the House must be of",19
NA,profoundly disappointed because the tralian,19
NA,Prime Minister's review contained no,19
NA,reference whatsoever to the need for a strategy,19
NA,united Australian Army available for serOpposition,19
NA,"vice anywhere as required, without limitathis country.",19
NA,"tion. The House in general, and honor-",19
NA,able members on this side of the chamber,19
NA,"in particular, must be alarmed at the",19
NA,action of the Prime Minister in neglectis,19
NA,"ing to place before Parliament, which",19
NA,consists of the elected trustees of the,19
NA,"people of this country, information",19
NA,least similar to that which he placed,19
NA,before the conference of the Australian,19
NA,Labour party which met on the 17th in,19
NA,"November last. As the Prime Minister,",19
NA,"in his statement, has completely ignored",19
NA,this very important matter^ which,19
NA,be as disturbing to the Australian,19
NA,strategy as the right honorable gentleman,19
NA,"has said it is to the High Command, I a",19
NA,intend to make a precise statement of the,19
NA,"facts in chronological order, so that this to",19
NA,House and the people of Australia may,19
NA,have clearly before them the attitude that,19
NA,the Opposition has persistently and connecessary,19
NA,sistently adopted in urging a maximum wealth.,19
NA,"war effort for the defence of Australia,",19
NA,since the outbreak of war with Japan.,19
NA,This House was called together on the,19
NA,"16th December, 1941, a little more than",19
NA,"a week after Japan had invaded, and",19
NA,ruthlessly and treacherously attacked.,19
NA,British and American territory. Aus-,19
NA,tralia was then at war with Japan. As,19
NA,"the Prime Minister said on that occasion,",19
NA,"Australia was "" the stake in the conflict"".",19
NA,"On the 17th December, on behalf of",19
NA,"the Opposition, I wrote to the Prime",19
NA,"Minister a letter, the full text of which",19
NA,"appears in Hansard of the 1st May, 1942.",19
NA,I shall quote some of the more important,19
NA,passages from it. I said-,19
NA,. . . i t appears to the Opposition that i t,19
NA,a l l important to create an Australian army,19
NA,to for the defertce of the Commonwealth which,19
NA,the Government can employ anywhere without,19
NA,statutory restrictions whatsoever. Malayn,19
NA,and the Pacific Islands are as truly part of,19
NA,Australia's defences as are our own coastal,19
NA,ports. I n our opinion the Government must,19
NA,"be able to employ as i t may wish, and as the",19
NA,"necessity demands, any Australian troops",19
NA,"anywhere, be they voluntarily enlisted or",19
NA,to raised under the Defence Act.,19
NA,T h e letter c o n t i n u e d -,19
NA,. . . The Opposition stresses the impor-,19
NA,of meeting the enemy outside the shores,19
NA,"Australia as well as within, and the dis-",19
NA,tinction which must be drawn between Aus-,19
NA,Imperial Force and M i l i t i a at the,19
NA,present moment may seriously hamper the,19
NA,"of your Government and interfere, tlie",19
NA,"feels, with the adequate defence of",19
NA,'The Prime Minister himself has empha-,19
NA,sized the importance of meeting the,19
NA,enemy outside Australia. Surely there,19
NA,not an honorable member of this House,19
NA,who does not recognize and appreciate to,19
NA,the full that the farther from Australian,19
NA,at shores the enemy can be met the better,19
NA,"will the result be for us. Therefore, I",19
NA,assume-an d it cannot be disputed-tha t,19
NA,regard to this desirable objective the,19
NA,Opposition and the Government are on,19
NA,common ground. I n my letter to the,19
NA,must Prime Minister I stated further-,19
NA,While having no desire to raise any contro-,19
NA,"versial political question, but animated with",19
NA,sincere wish to free the hands of your Go-,19
NA,"vernment, the Opposition would be prepared",19
NA,give unanimous support to a measure,19
NA,amending the National Security Act in such,19
NA,a manner as to enable the Government to,19
NA,employ any of our troops i n any area vitally,19
NA,for the defence of the Common-,19
NA,That is evidence of a sincere desire on,19
NA,the part of the Opposition to co-operate,19
NA,with the Government in the provision of,19
NA,"what, in its opinion, was needed at that",20
NA,particular time for the adequate defence,20
NA,of Australia. Every member of this,20
NA,House supported a resolution which,20
NA,pledged the Government to take every,20
NA,step deemed necessary to defend the Com-,20
NA,"monwealth and its territories, to carry on",20
NA,"hostilities in association witb our Allies,",20
NA,and to achieve final victory over our,20
NA,enemies. That pledge was given unani-,20
NA,mously irrespective of party affiliations',20
NA,by the trustees of the people of,20
NA,Australia who constitute the mem-,20
NA,"bers of this House. I repeat, that",20
NA,the Opposition was mindful of the weak-,20
NA,"ness that existed for forward planning,",20
NA,"particularly for an offensive campaign,",20
NA,and was motivated entirely by that con-,20
NA,"sideration when I , on its behalf, wrote",20
NA,to the Prime Minister on the 17tb,20
NA,December of last year. But the Govern-,20
NA,"ment ignored my letter, and we have not",20
NA,since heard anything concerning it.,20
NA,"When the House met la3t April, the",20
NA,matter of an army merger was pressed.,20
NA,The Prime Minister then stated that the,20
NA,"use of Australian forces, whatever their",20
NA,"composition, involved advice from the",20
NA,"High Command upon military strategy,",20
NA,and a statement of the forces tbat were,20
NA,required. He said that he knew of no,20
NA,demand imposed by military necessity,20
NA,upon his Government that he had not,20
NA,"already satisfied, and declared that the",20
NA,Government regarded an outright,20
NA,Japanese attack on Australia as a con-,20
NA,stant and undiminished danger. Yet he,20
NA,"was prepared to countenance, the exist-",20
NA,ence of a divided army in Australia;,20
NA,"and, indeed, he is still countenancing it,",20
NA,to the detriment of the adequate and,20
NA,indispensable defence of this country. At,20
NA,"the same time, the Government looks to",20
NA,the United Nations to provide fighting,20
NA,forces that will amalgamate with our own,20
NA,forces wherever the enemy has to Be met.,20
NA,I now move,20
NA,GOVERNMENT MEMBERS -Ah !,20
Mr FADDEN , I now move to the,20
NA,events of the 1st May.,20
NA,Mr CURTIN.!-Th e right honorable,20
NA,gentleman gave them a fright.,20
Mr FADDEN ,.Som e honorable,20
NA,members will be greatly relieved when,20
NA,they learn that I do not intend to move,20
NA,in the direction that they feared I would.,20
NA,"They need not be frightened, because the",20
NA,Opposition is mindful of tbe necessity to,20
NA,place national responsibilities and con-,20
NA,sequences above party political con-,20
NA,"siderations. On the 1st May, a patient",20
NA,"but responsible Opposition, through me,",20
NA,moved the following amendment to the,20
NA,motion for the printing of the statement,20
NA,on international affairs that had been,20
NA,made by the Prime Minister:-,20
NA,In order that the Australian Imperial Force,20
NA,and the Australian Military Forces may be,20
NA,effectively welded into one fighting army avail-,20
NA,"able for offence as well as defence, this House",20
NA,is of opinion that all territorial limitations,20
NA,upon the power of the Commonwealth Govern-,20
NA,ment to employ the Australian Military Forces,20
NA,should be removed.,20
NA,Not one Minister or Labour member ad-,20
NA,vanced a convincing reason for refusing,20
NA,to take the action then suggested by the,20
NA,Opposition. My amendment was rejected,20
NA,"on party lines by 31 votes to 27, witb the",20
NA,"assistance of alleged independents, and",20
NA,the Government again took refuge in,20
NA,silence. The gravity of the position was,20
NA,becoming greater. The situation i n the,20
NA,Pacific had deteriorated so markedly that,20
NA,"Sydney was raided, bombs were dropped",20
NA,"on Townsville, Darwin was consistently",20
NA,"raided, Horn Island and Port Hedland",20
NA,were raided and bombed. Yet tbe Go-,20
NA,"vernment took no action, and was not",20
NA,mindful of its true responsibility.,20
NA,"I n July and August last, the federal",20
NA,Opposition executive twice brought be-,20
NA,"fore the Government the need, in our",20
NA,"opinion, for the merging of the Aus-",20
NA,tralian Imperial Force and the Militia,20
NA,into one army for the adequate defence,20
NA,of Australia. The executive charged the,20
NA,Government with having deliberately,20
NA,evaded the issue for many months. I t,20
NA,"merely asked that preparations be made,",20
NA,"by amendment of the Defence Act,",20
NA,"to enable the Government, in its wisdom,",20
NA,"to send Australian forces wherever, in",20
NA,"the opinion of military experts, they",20
NA,might be required.,20
NA,"We now move to September, 194©, in",20
NA,which month Parliament re-assembled,20
NA,and honorable members were given a re-,20
NA,view of the war situation along lines,20
NA,similar to that made to-day; but the,20
NA,"Government then, as i t had been on the",20
NA,"previous occasion, and as i t was again",20
NA,"to-day, was silent on the proposal for the",20
NA,establishment of one army.,20
NA,"I n October, 1942, my colleague tbe",21
NA,honorable member for Gippsland ( Mr.,21
NA,Paterson) raised the matter of having,21
NA,one army. The Minister for the Army,21
NA,( Mr Forde) then began what subse-,21
NA,quently developed into a policy of evasion,21
NA,on a grand scale. He revealed himself,21
NA,as one who was completely lacking in,21
NA,"candour, and apparently afraid to risk",21
NA,saying anything that might make him,21
NA,unpopular with his political party and,21
NA,supporters. Either he did not know what,21
NA,"was going on, or he was not frank enough",21
NA,to place the facts before the members of,21
NA,this Parliament as the trustees of the,21
NA,people of Australia. He side-stepped the,21
NA,issue. He had much to say about trans-,21
NA,fers of the Militia to the Australian,21
NA,"Imperial Force, and of Australia honor-",21
NA,"ing its obligations to the democracies,",21
NA,he evaded a direct reply to a direct ques-,21
NA,tion. He must have known that adoption,21
NA,of the proposal put forward by the,21
NA,Opposition was necessary for the defence,21
NA,of Australia and its territories.,21
NA,"Minister for the Army, he must have",21
NA,been in close contact with the High,21
NA,"Command, and with other officers who",21
NA,were competent to give him requisite,21
NA,advice.,21
NA,Parliament again went into recess,21
NA,without any action by the Government to,21
NA,"give one army to Australia, as bad been",21
NA,consistently and persistently proposed by,21
NA,the Opposition. On the 28th September,21
NA,"last, the press reported that there was",21
NA,reason to believe that the Government,21
NA,had no immediate intention of welding,21
NA,the Australian Imperial Force and the,21
NA,Militia into one army. The Minister for,21
NA,the Army said that the Militia in New,21
NA,Guinea had already built up a tradition,21
NA,that would make anv government hesitate,21
NA,before taking action to destroy its separ-,21
NA,ate identity. Members of the Opposi-,21
NA,"tion are fully alive to, and appreciate",21
NA,"to the utmost, the valiant deeds of the",21
NA,Militia Forces in the theatres of war in,21
NA,which they have served. We pay tribute,21
NA,"to them, and honour them for their heroic",21
NA,actions. We owe them a debt of grati-,21
NA,tude. They have been in the fight to,21
NA,keep the Japanese forces away from Aus-,21
NA,tralia. The memhers of the Australian,21
NA,Imperial Force have the same objective.,21
NA,"Why, then, should the Minister for the",21
NA,Army make a distinction between them?,21
NA,Ilr. Fadden.,21
NA,Are not all these men Australian? Have,21
NA,they not shown themselves ready to,21
NA,sacrifice their lives in the cause of,21
NA,liberty? Have they not been fighting,21
NA,alongside an allied force which may,21
NA,be sent to any theatre in which the,21
NA,Japanese menace may be encountered?,21
NA,All this talk about Australia honouring,21
NA,its obligations has a hollow ring. Could,21
NA,anything be more hypocritical than,21
NA,mouthing phrases about an all-in war,21
NA,effort and of driving the enemy from our,21
NA,"shores, whilst at tbe same time refusing",21
NA,to allow a section of the Australian Army,21
NA,to fight alongside the forces of other,21
NA,nations beyond Australian territories,21
NA,"and, indeed, if the occasion should arise,",21
NA,to help their own kith and kin who are,21
NA,members of the Australian Imperial,21
NA,but Force? Let us face the facts. We have,21
NA,powerful allies in this fight. The mem-,21
NA,bers of their forces are available to meet,21
NA,the enemy wherever he has to be fought.,21
NA,Their reason for being in this war is no,21
NA,"As different from ours, and their object is",21
NA,to defeat a common enemy. Many of,21
NA,them have known the ravages of war in,21
NA,their own lands. Some of them have losf,21
NA,"their homes, their possessions, and their",21
NA,"families. Yet, whilst we expect them to",21
NA,"help us, the Government has so far",21
NA,refused to give them the maximum assist-,21
NA,ance which would he available i f the,21
NA,existing limitations upon the use of the,21
NA,Militia were expeditiously removed. Why,21
NA,should we have a divided army? On,21
NA,what grounds can the Government pos-,21
NA,sibly justify its refusal to weld the Aus-,21
NA,tralian Imperial Force and the Militia,21
NA,"into one force, to fight alongside the",21
NA,forces of our allies? These are questions,21
NA,which have exercised the. minds of not,21
NA,"only the Opposition, but also the people",21
NA,"of Australia, and, particularly, our allies.",21
NA,"On the 27-th October, the Minister for",21
NA,"the Army, speaking as Deputy Prime",21
NA,"Minister, made the following state-",21
NA,ment :-,21
NA,There is neither necessity nor justification,21
NA,for conscription for over-seas service to-day.,21
NA,I ask the House to link that statement,21
NA,with what has happened since the 17th,21
NA,November. The Minister went on tc,21
NA,say-,21
NA,The Opposition believes that there is one,21
NA,issue which would certainly split the Labour,21
NA,party and divide the people of Australia.,21
NA,He said further-,22
NA,The Government's attitude has been clearly,22
NA,defined. I t is opposed to conscription,22
NA,"seas service, and the introduction of the issue",22
NA,at this critical period does a great disservice,22
NA,to Australia.,22
NA,"He declared that, with the changed posi-",22
NA,"tion following Japan's entry into the war,",22
NA,and the great increase of voluntary enlist-,22
NA,"ments in the Australian Imperial Force,",22
NA,there was less need for conscription for,22
NA,overseas service to-day than there had,22
NA,been at any previous time. After,22
NA,reiterating that the Opposition was doing,22
NA,the country a great disservice in raising,22
NA,"the issue, the Deputy Prime Minister",22
NA,said:-,22
NA,"This issue, i f put into effect, would",22
NA,"destroy the Government, hut would also divide",22
NA,the people and bring about disunity where,22
NA,unity and co-operation exist.,22
NA,The Deputy Prime Minister's statement,22
NA,had at least one merit: I t was exceed-,22
NA,ingly frank. He admitted unshamedly,22
NA,that the issue was one that would split,22
NA,the Labour party and destroy the Govern-,22
NA,ment. The honorable gentleman is also,22
NA,Minister for the Army. Are we to,22
NA,assume that the Army leaders advised,22
NA,him as to the nature of the statement he,22
NA,made on that occasion? Are we to assume,22
NA,that he and the Prime Minister are at,22
NA,"variance now, and that it is still his belief",22
NA,that those who advocate the unity of the,22
NA,forces are doing a disservice to Australia ?,22
NA,The Deputy Prime Minister also stated,22
NA,"that i f the Government failed, either in",22
NA,"its defensive or offensive preparations,",22
NA,then would be the time for the Opposition,22
NA,"to criticize. I remind the House, how-",22
NA,"ever, that i f the Opposition remained",22
NA,"silent until then, it would be too late to",22
NA,"do anything, and the fate of political",22
NA,parties and of governments would be of,22
NA,little account.,22
NA,We come now to the memorable 17th,22
NA,November. The Interstate Conference,22
NA,of the Australian Labour party was,22
NA,"sitting in Melbourne, and tbe Prime Min-",22
NA,ister was there as a delegate of his own,22
NA,"State of Western Australia, not as Prime",22
NA,"Minister. According to press statements,",22
NA,it was announced to that conference,22
NA,that it would be asked to agree to,22
NA,an amendment of the Defence Act to per-,22
NA,mit the use of the Militia in certain de-,22
NA,fined areas in the Pacific. The Prime,22
NA,"Minister, we read, told the conference",22
NA,that limitations upon the use of the,22
NA,for over- Militia imposed by the Defence Act,22
NA,were hampering the war plans of the,22
NA,Allied High Command in Australia. We,22
NA,"may take it for granted that, before he",22
NA,"made the statement, he had been in con-",22
NA,"sultation with the High Command, and",22
NA,was aware of official opinion. We may,22
NA,assume that he had been told that the,22
NA,"change was necessary, that the merging",22
NA,of the two armies was essential so that,22
NA,our forces might be used wherever re-,22
NA,quired. We may also assume that the,22
NA,Prime Minister would tell the conference,22
NA,as much as he was able without violating,22
NA,official secrets. He would reveal to dele-,22
NA,not only gates enough to convince them that his,22
NA,decision on the subject should not be,22
NA,"questioned, and that the Labour organi-",22
NA,zations should support him.,22
NA,When the Prime Minister sought leave,22
NA,"to introduce his motion, i t was given by",22
NA,"28 votes to 8, the eight in opposition",22
NA,including a member of his own Govern-,22
NA,"ment, Senator Cameron, and the honor-",22
NA,able member for Melbourne ( Mr.,22
NA,Calwell). The text of the Prime,22
NA,M i n i s t e r ' s m o t i o n is as f o l l o w s : -,22
NA,That having regard to the paramount,22
NA,necessity of Australia's defence as set out,22
NA,in section 5 of the special resolution adopted,22
NA,"in June, 1940, by federal conference the",22
NA,Government be authorized to add to the Defence,22
NA,Act i n the definition of the Commonwealth,22
NA,which at present defines the territories to,22
NA,which this act extends the following words:,22
NA,""" And such other territories in the South-west",22
NA,Pacific area as the Governor-General proclaims,22
NA,as being territories associated with the defence,22
NA,"of Australia.""",22
NA,As the motion contains a reference to,22
NA,"the resolution carried in June, 1940, I",22
NA,shall quote the text of that resolution,22
NA,for the information of honorable members,22
NA,and of the Australian people. I t was as,22
NA,follows:-,22
NA,National training for defence in the terms,22
NA,of the present Defence Act be maintained on,22
NA,the highest basis of efficiency with provision,22
NA,for an adequate system of physical training,22
NA,"throughout Australia, by participating i n the",22
NA,Empire A i r Scheme; necessary provisions for,22
NA,reinforcements of the Australian Imperial,22
NA,Force; the extent of European participation,22
NA,by volunteer army to ibe determined by circum-,22
NA,"stances as they arise, having regard to the",22
NA,paramount necessity of Australian defence.,22
NA,No doulbt the Prime Minister put for-,22
NA,"ward the plea, as would any responsible",22
NA,"Australian, that the adequate defence of",22
NA,Australia cannot stop at the 3-mile,23
NA,limit. Would any one suggest that Aus-,23
NA,tralia has not for years been defended by,23
NA,what has taken place in the English,23
NA,"Channel, the Mediterranean, Burma,",23
NA,"China, and Rtissia? Obviously, Aus-",23
NA,tralia is to be defended wherever the,23
NA,enemy can be met and fought. I t is for,23
NA,that reason that the Prime Minister asked,23
NA,the Australian Labour party to agree to,23
NA,the amendment of the Defence Act so that,23
NA,Australia might be defended in the man-,23
NA,ner stated to be necessary-state d not by,23
NA,"the Government or by the Opposition, but",23
NA,"by those best able to offer an opinion, tbe",23
NA,High Command.,23
NA,The conference decided to adjourn con-,23
NA,"sideration of the matter, and i t was re-",23
NA,ferred to the State branches for con-,23
NA,sideration so tbat they might direct their,23
NA,delegates how to vote at a special con-,23
NA,ference to be held not later than the end,23
NA,of December. Whilst the Prime Minister,23
NA,is to be commended for taking a realistic,23
NA,"view of the situation, the manner in",23
NA,which he acted calls for comment. My,23
NA,view is that such an important matter,23
NA,"was one for consideration, in the first",23
NA,"place, by Cabinet and the Advisory War",23
NA,Council. The next move would have been,23
NA,to summon Parliament to consider it.,23
NA,"However, I recognize the position of the",23
NA,Prime Minister. He is a member of a,23
NA,"party to which he has given a pledge,",23
NA,and he must submit to the rules and,23
NA,regulations of that party. The people,23
NA,must understand that every Labour repre-,23
NA,sentative whom they elect immediately,23
NA,"passes beyond their control, and comes",23
NA,directly under the control of an irrespon-,23
NA,sible party junta.,23
NA,One would have thought that the Prime,23
NA,Minister would have at least received,23
NA,the unanimous support of those whom,23
NA,he leads. He has persevered in support,23
NA,"of the platform of his party up till now,",23
NA,and has resisted the consistent pressure,23
NA,of the Opposition to amend the Defence,23
NA,Act. No doubt he hoped from day to day,23
NA,that the war situation might improve and,23
NA,that it would not be necessary for him to,23
NA,humiliate himself by having to approach,23
NA,an outside organization and ask it to give,23
NA,him power to govern the nation in time,23
NA,of war. I am sure that the Prime Minis-,23
NA,ter recognizes the humiliating position in,23
NA,"which he has placed himself. Even then,",23
NA,ifr. Fadden.,23
NA,the Labour conference would not support,23
NA,"him. I t ""passed the buck"" to the State",23
NA,"executives, and in the meantime the war",23
NA,is raging and the position in the Pacific is,23
NA,no less grave that it was on the 17th,23
NA,"November. I t is, as I have said, humilia-",23
NA,ting thait a war-time Prime Minister,23
NA,should have to approach a gathering of,23
NA,"men representing, not the whole of the",23
NA,"Australian people, but only a section of",23
NA,them. I t is a body entirely lacking i n,23
NA,"official status, and we, as the elected",23
NA,"representatives of the people, cannot con-",23
NA,done the method followed by the Prime,23
NA,Minister. We are the elected represen-,23
NA,"tatives of the people, and there is only",23
NA,one place where the military requirements,23
NA,"of the nation should be decided-tha t is,",23
NA,in this Parliament. We recall the Prime,23
NA,"Minister's bold declaration in December,",23
NA,"1941, a few days after Japan entered",23
NA,the war-,23
NA,"I say to tlie people of Australia, I cannot",23
NA,wait upon debate.,23
NA,"Yet, in November, 1942, the Prime Min-",23
NA,ister has been forced to wait until his,23
NA,party supporters debate an important,23
NA,question of national defence. He has told,23
NA,the people and his own organization that,23
NA,"this is not a political matter, that it is a",23
NA,"military necessity, one that is regarded as",23
NA,of the first importance by the High Com-,23
NA,mand of the South Pacific.,23
NA,"On the 19th November, there was still",23
NA,further delay. The federal executive of,23
NA,tbe Australian Labour party decided that,23
NA,the special conference would not be held,23
NA,until the 4th January of next year. I n,23
NA,"the meantime, the war continues to",23
NA,"rage, and necessary defence measures",23
NA,are being delayed. The Labour party,23
NA,"is itself divided on this question,",23
NA,and for that very reason Parlia-,23
NA,ment should have been taken into the,23
NA,Prime Minister's confidence at the very,23
NA,earliest date. I t is an unpardonable,23
NA,thing that this House should be denied,23
NA,information which was placed by the,23
NA,Prime Minister before the executive of,23
NA,a political party. The Australian Labour,23
NA,party has decided to hold a further,23
NA,special conference on the 4th January-,23
NA,a delay of six and a half weeks following,23
NA,-the first conference. These little dictators,23
NA,were afraid to give the Prime Minister,23
NA,the authority he sought because they,23
NA,feared to risk their own political hides.,23
NA,"The risks of the men who are fighting,",24
NA,the danger of the Japanese moving far-,24
NA,"ther south, and all the implications",24
NA,of the Japanese menace did not matter.,24
NA,Visualize what might happen i f our,24
NA,own fighting men and those of our,24
NA,.allies adopted the standstill attitude.,24
NA,"Would they have captured Gona, as we",24
NA,learn to-day they have done ? Subsequent,24
NA,to the interstate Labour 'Conference in,24
NA,"Melbourne, the Prime Minister declared",24
NA,that one army under one command in the,24
NA,South-west Pacific had become a military,24
NA,"necessity because of "" the bitter handicap",24
NA,imposed in dealing with the enemy by,24
NA,"factors hindering military mobility "". On",24
NA,"the 24th November, it was reported in the",24
NA,press that the full Cabinet supported the,24
NA,"Prime Minister's proposal. However,",24
NA,three members were not in agreement,24
NA,with the proposal. The Prime Minister,24
NA,"went .first to an outside junta, and,",24
NA,".secondly, to the Cabinet with his pro-",24
NA,"posal, but the Cabinet was not unanimous",24
NA,and three members publicly declared their,24
NA,-disagreement. Cabinet government is in,24
NA,jeopardy as the result. The Prime Min-,24
NA,ister discussed this matter neither with,24
NA,"the Advisory War Council nor, so far,",24
NA,"with this Parliament, the only constitu-",24
NA,tional body with which it should be dis-,24
NA,cussed. The Sydney Morning Herald of,24
NA,"the 28th November, in its report of the",24
NA,"meeting of the Cabinet, stated-",24
NA,He ( Mr Curtin) strongly combated tbe,24
NA,argument that his proposal amounted tp the,24
NA,general introduction of conscription. I t meant,24
NA,"nothing of the sort, he said. There would",24
NA,be a Militia and an Australian Imperial Force,24
NA,as separate entities.,24
NA,"I f the idea of the Prime Minister, as",24
NA,originally submitted to the interstate,24
NA,"Labour Conference, does not mean that",24
NA,the Australian Imperial Force and the,24
NA,"Militia are to be welded into one army,",24
NA,with an equal liability to serve and enjoy-,24
NA,"ing similar conditions, the Australian",24
NA,people have been misled. I f there is to,24
NA,be a distinction between the Australian,24
NA,Imperial Force and the Militia in the,24
NA,"South-west Pacific area, the Govern-",24
NA,ment will only be aggravating the unsatis-,24
NA,factory state of affairs which has existed,24
NA,since the Opposition first raised the,24
NA,matter. The Prime Minister should tell,24
NA,"this House and, through this House, the",24
NA,people of Australia exactly what his pro-,24
NA,posal means.,24
NA,"Only a little more than a week ago,",24
NA,"the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr.",24
NA,"Churchill, in a world broadcast, made a",24
NA,"telling point when referring to the fact,",24
NA,that the war in Europe might end before,24
NA,the war in Asia. Mr Churchill said-,24
NA,"Should events take such a course, we should",24
NA,immediately bring all our forces to the other,24
NA,side of the world to the aid of America and,24
NA,"China and, above all, to our own kith and kin",24
NA,in Australia and New Zealand in their valiant,24
NA,struggle agajnst Japan's aggressions.,24
NA,Contrast the British Prime Minister's,24
NA,pledge with the reluctance-th e enforced,24
NA,reluctance-o f the Prime Minister of,24
NA,Australia and his Ministers to merge,24
NA,the Australian Imperial Force and,24
NA,the Militia into one army for service,24
NA,wherever required. Though Britain is,24
NA,"prepared to come to our aid, we are not",24
NA,prepared tp send more than a section of,24
NA,our army to the aid of Britain. Such,24
NA,"a state of affairs is cowardly, i t demon-",24
NA,strates the political cowardice of the,24
NA,"Ministry,",24
NA,I now propose to state the conclusions,24
NA,that the Opposition has reached as the,24
NA,result of careful analysis of developments,24
NA,over the last thirteen months or so.,24
NA,"First, the Government stands condemned",24
NA,for its attitude to this proposal since it,24
NA,was first raised by the Opposition twelve,24
NA,months ago next week. The Opposition,24
NA,has consistently brought this matter for-,24
NA,"ward. We have been decidedly patient,",24
NA,but we recognize that the merging of the,24
NA,still two armies and the employment of the,24
NA,Militia wherever circumstances require,24
NA,are indispensable and are an inescapable,24
NA,necessity i f we are to wage total war in,24
NA,the defence of Australia. We have been,24
NA,motivated by no other -reason than our,24
NA,desire to ensure that we shall be able to,24
NA,do that. We could have made political,24
NA,capital out of this matter had we so,24
NA,desired; we desire with a full recognition,24
NA,of its position to assist and co-operate,24
NA,with the Government in obtaining ade-,24
NA,"quate defence for Australia. That, we",24
NA,"consider, can be got only along the lines",24
NA,of policy advocated in our letter to the,24
NA,"Prime Minister of the 17th September,",24
NA,1942. [Extension of time granted.],24
NA,The Government has been guilty of pro-,24
NA,"crastination, deliberate evasion, and a",24
NA,complete failure to measure up to the,25
NA,proper defence needs of a nation,25
NA,threatened by a powerful enemy and,25
NA,dependent on association with our allies.,25
NA,The Government's attitude contrasts,25
NA,strikingly with the speed with which i t,25
NA,has acted in matters which it has con-,25
NA,sidered politically favorable.,25
NA,"Secondly, when the Prime Minister",25
NA,"very belatedly did move in the matter, he",25
NA,did so in a way to which the Opposition,25
NA,takes the strongest possible exception.,25
NA,We submit that in Parliament the,25
NA,elected representatives of the people,25
NA,should have been first advised of this very,25
NA,"important matter, particularly in view of",25
NA,"the attitude of the Opposition, which bas",25
NA,been consistent since the 17th .September,25
NA,last. The urgent need to extend the use,25
NA,of the Militia must have been impressed,25
NA,upon the Prime Minister. He must have,25
NA,been advised and convinced by his,25
NA,advisers that the limitations on the use of,25
NA,the Militia were hampering the war effort.,25
NA,Why did he consider i t to be a matter,25
NA,requiring the consideration of an outside,25
NA,organization? Why did he not regard,25
NA,the matter as one calling for an urgent,25
NA,decision. Parliament could have been,25
NA,summoned immediately he was acquainted,25
NA,with the requirements of the High Com-,25
NA,mand. Had the Prime Minister taken,25
NA,this course-th e right and proper one-,25
NA,the decision could have been taken by,25
NA,the elected representatives of the whole,25
NA,"Australian people. Parliament, and not",25
NA,"the executive of the Labour party, has",25
NA,the responsibility to ensure that the war,25
NA,shall be prosecuted with the maximum,25
NA,"degree of effectiveness. Likewise, the",25
NA,Prime Minister has a responsibility to,25
NA,discharge to the people of this country.,25
NA,His actionwith the resultant indecision,25
NA,and delay by the Australian Labour party,25
NA,was an affront to Parliament and to the,25
NA,people which honorable members cannot,25
NA,condone.,25
NA,"Thirdly, the reference of this matter",25
NA,to an outside organization obviously,25
NA,put Australia in a bad light in the eyes,25
NA,of our allies. Already we have had evition,25
NA,dence of a misunderstanding in the United parties and by most members.,25
NA,States of America because we are,25
NA,prepared to allow the whole of our,25
NA,troops to fight wherever required. Those able member,25
NA,of us who are jealous of Australia's,25
NA,Mr Fadden.,25
NA,reputation and integrity are anxious,25
NA,that anything likely to cause i l l feeling,25
NA,between ourselves and our allies should,25
NA,be speedily removed . 1,25
NA,The Opposition demands that Par-,25
NA,liament shall be called together as,25
NA,early as the circumstances will permit.,25
NA,Parliament should provide the means,25
NA,to meet the requirements of an all-in,25
NA,war effort. We do not assure the,25
NA,Prime Minister that we shall accept,25
NA,whatever proposal be may put before,25
NA,"Parliament, but we shall give careful con-",25
NA,sideration to it. We shall be guided by,25
NA,the conditions which exist in the light,25
NA,of military advice and strategic informa-,25
NA,tion placed before us by the Prime,25
NA,Minister as to what is needed for the,25
NA,"adequate defence of Australia, and as to",25
NA,the best means of bringing i t into,25
NA,existence.,25
Mr BLACKBURN ,Bourke) [4.25] -,25
NA,I move-,25
NA,"That all words after ""That"" be left out",25
NA,with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words,25
NA,""" this House, reaffirming the policy upon",25
NA,which the majority of its members were,25
NA,"elected, opposes the imposition of any form",25
NA,of compulsory service outside Australia and,25
NA,the Territories of the Commonwealth.,25
NA,The amendment is really the obverse,25
NA,of the amendment moved by the,25
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eadden),25
NA,"on the 1st May, 1942. There",25
NA,are two things in this amendment.,25
NA,"First, i t reminds the House that the",25

NA,to do what we think fit. We are elected,25
NA,"on pledges which we gave to the people,",25

NA,self again to the electors. The last elec-,25
NA,was fought on a pledge given by all,25
NA,I,25
NA,not except the honorable member for,25
NA,"Deakin ( Mr Hutchinson), the honor-",25
NA,for Boothby (Dr,25
NA,"Price), the honorable member for",25
NA,"Barker ( Mr Archie Cameron), and the",26
NA,honorable member for Wakefield ( Mr.,26
NA,"Duncan-Hughes)-ther e are, I suppose",26
NA,a round half-dozen whom one can except,26
NA,-bu t the other members agreed with,26
NA,their parties in saying that they would,26
NA,not support alteration of the Defence,26
NA,Act to provide that men shall be sent,26
NA,to serve beyond Australia and its terri-,26
NA,tories. The Leader of the Opposition has,26
NA,referred to the resolution carried in,26
NA,"June, 1940, at the Australian Labour",26
NA,"party conference, but the very words in",26
NA,that resolution made it perfectly clear,26
NA,tbat the service was to be within the,26
NA,terms of the Defence Act. That Defence,26
NA,Act contains section 49 which provides,26
NA,against service outside Australia and,26
NA,Australian territories. Immediately after,26
NA,"that conference had met, this House met,",26
NA,and the right honorable member for,26
NA,"Kooyong ( Mr Menzies), who was Prime",26
NA,"Minister, submitted to this House an",26
NA,amendment of the National Security Act,26
NA,which was carried and which provided,26
NA,that nothing in that act should authorize,26
NA,the imposition of any form of compul-,26
NA,sory service beyond tbe limits of Aus-,26
NA,tralia. That was common ground. I t,26
NA,was common ground with every body that,26
NA,"whatever else might be done, service out-",26
NA,side the limits of Australia should not,26
NA,be imposed. There were people who,26
NA,thought we should not go so far as,26
NA,that implied. This House is now,26
NA,asked by my amendment to reaffirm the,26
NA,policy on which the majority-th e great,26
NA,majority-o f its members were elected.,26
NA,That policy was opposition to any,26
NA,extension of compulsory service. Almost,26
NA,"40 years have elapsed since, after a",26
NA,"conflict of opinion in this Parliament,",26
NA,there was put into the Defence Act a,26
NA,provision that voluntary forces ' should,26
NA,not be required to serve outside Australia.,26
NA,That was inserted in 1903 as a result of,26
NA,a difference of opinion which arose i n the,26
NA,early days of federation. The then go-,26
NA,vernment introduced legislation to enable,26
NA,it to send citizen forces anywhere in the,26
NA,world. That was opposed by nearly all,26
NA,honorable members. The government,26
NA,"said that that was not really its intention,",26
NA,and the bill was abandoned. The bill as,26
NA,finally passed in 1903 contained section,26
NA,"49, which is the only guarantee that we",26
NA,shall have in Australia adequate forces,26
NA,for the defence of our hearths and,26
NA,homes. My objection and the objec-,26
NA,"tion held by a large number of people,",26
NA,which would decide me i f there,26
NA,were no other reasons for my,26
NA,"attitude on this matter, is that",26
NA,I believe that tbe community has,26
NA,not the -moral right to compel persons to,26
NA,go abroad from this land to fight.,26
NA,I f a man of his own free will volunteers,26
NA,"for service overseas, it is no doubt because",26
NA,of his having arrived at a reasoned con-,26
NA,clusion that he should do so. But many,26
NA,"persons in this community, of whom I am",26
NA,"one, believe that it is entirely wrong to",26
NA,compel people to bear arms in a country,26
NA,other than their own.,26
Mr ABBOTT ,Doe s the honorable mem-,26
NA,ber think that it is wrong to compel people,26
NA,to bear arms in defence of their own,26
NA,country ?,26
Mr BLACKBURN ,Excep t in the,26
NA,"case of conscientious objectors, I agree",26
NA,that people should be required to bear,26
NA,arms in defence of their own land. But,26
NA,a small minority of persons will not,26
NA,"resist violence, and I believe that it is",26
NA,practicable to make special provisions to,26
NA,meet their case. There is a vast differ-,26
NA,"ence, however, between requiring persons",26
NA,to bear arms in their own country in order,26
NA,to resist other persons who are un-,26
NA,"doubtedly aggressors, and requiring them",26
NA,to bear arms in a country other than,26
NA,their own. I f a person considers i t his,26
NA,duty to take up arms in a country,26
NA,other than his own that is his business;,26
NA,we should not compel him to do so. I n,26
NA,the one case it seems to me that the com-,26
NA,pulsion is a form of organization. There,26
NA,is an instinct in a man which causes him,26
NA,to resist an aggressor. There is reason in,26
NA,requiring a person to bear arms in defence,26
NA,of his own country. There can be no,26
NA,instinct in a man which will compel him,26
NA,to bear arms in defence of another man's,26
NA,country. Although some persons may be,26
NA,forced by reasons which they regard as,26
NA,sufficient to take up arms in defence of,26
NA,"a country other than their own, that is a",26
NA,very different thing from compelling them,26
NA,to do so. I f we compel a person to take up,26
NA,arms for the purpose of fighting overseas,26
NA,that person may be obliged to bear arms,26
NA,against subject populations which have,26
NA,no interest at all in the quarrel that has,26
NA,"to be settled. I bave in mind, for ex-",27
NA,"ample, Malays, Burmese and tbe people",27
NA,"of India, who bave no interest in the",27
NA,present quarrel except their desire to keep,27
NA,out of it.,27
NA,"Mr RANKIN,-Th e honorable gentle-",27
NA,man is prepared to accept the help of,27
NA,conscripts from another country to defend,27
NA,Australia.,27
Mr BLACKBURN ,Th e honorable,27
NA,"member for Bendigo ( Mr Rankin), even",27
NA,"so recently as last year, was opposed to",27
NA,conscription. I n support of that state-,27
NA,ment I direct attention to the following,27
NA,remarks that he made in this House on,27
NA,"the 2nd July, 1941, as reported in Han-",27
NA,"sard, vol. 167, page 765:-",27
NA,Personally I do not believe in conscription.,27
NA,"During the last war I did not vote for it, and",27
NA,specific reasons have prompted me to adopt,27
NA,"this attitude. For example, a general in",27
NA,will take the best weapon that comes to his,27
NA,hand and will use i t again and again. It,27
NA,Australia had four divisions in the field with,27
NA,an unlimited supply of reinforcements they,27
NA,"would be employed repeatedly, and this coun-",27
NA,try would be bled white.,27
NA,I was in agreement with the honorable,27
NA,member at that time; but if he has,27
NA,changed his mind since then I regret,27
NA,that I cannot follow him.,27
Mr RANKIN , I was talking about a,27
NA,European war.,27
Mr BLACKBURN ,I t is quite clear,27
NA,that i f we sent our men abroad Australia,27
NA,might easily exhaust its man-power.,27
NA,I take a definite position on this,27
NA,"subject. Certain members of the House,",27
NA,like the honorable member for Deakin,27
NA,and the honorable member for Barker,27
NA,"have advocated consistently, at all times",27
NA,"since the commencement of the war, that",27
NA,our men should be compelled to serve,27
NA,overseas. I have no quarrel with them,27
NA,on that account. They have fought elec-,27
NA,tions upon the issue. The great majority,27
NA,"of honorable members, however, includ-",27
NA,ing the right honorable member for,27
NA,Kooyong ( Mr Menzies) and the right,27
NA,honorable member for Darling Downs,27
NA,( Mr Fadden) and many of their fol-,27
NA,lowers have not only refused to consent,27
NA,to the introduction of conscription in,27
NA,"Australia, but have also repudiated any",27
NA,such idea. The right honorable member,27
NA,for Kooyong was responsible for the,27
NA,insertion of a provision in the National,27
NA,Security Act that conscription could not,27
NA,be introduced by regulation. I n other,27
NA,"words, section 49 of the Defence Act",27
NA,cannot be overridden by regulations.,27
Mr CALWELL ,-An d tbe Government,27
NA,and party of which he was the leader,27
NA,supported him on that issue.,27
Mr BLACKBURN ,Tha t is so. I f,27
NA,those honorable gentlemen now desire,27
NA,release from undertakings that they have,27
NA,given in that regard they should seek,27
NA,them in the democratic way by approach-,27
NA,ing the electors on the subject. Other,27
NA,honorable members of the House also,27
NA,have opposed conscription consistently. I,27
NA,am one of them. I do not desire to,27
NA,traverse the reasons which I have pre-,27
NA,viously given for my attitude. I consider,27
NA,it sufficient for me to say at this stage,27
NA,that I am opposed to conscription on,27
NA,ethical grounds. The evils of industrial,27
NA,battle conscription which have been forced on,27
NA,this country will be aggravated one,27
NA,hundred-fold in the minds of militant,27
NA,unionists and other supporters of tbe,27
NA,Labour party i f the Government's present,27
NA,policy be applied. Other evils also may,27
NA,fall upon the country i f more of our men,27
NA,are sent far afield. We know very well,27
NA,that the Prime Minister not long ago,27
NA,threatened the coal-miners of Australia,27
NA,that i f ' they continued to strike they,27
NA,"would be put in uniform, which would",27
NA,mean that they would have to bear arms,27
NA,in defence of Australia.,27
Mr ABBOTT ,Woul d there be any-,27
NA,thing wrong with that?,27
Mr BLACKBURN , I call it an in-,27
NA,sult to the coal-miners of Australia to,27
NA,"tell them that they would be compelled,",27
NA,"as a punishment, to bear arms in defence",27
NA,of Australia and Australian territories.,27
Mr ABBOTT ,Th e honorable member,27
NA,should not cry about it.,27
Mr BLACKBURN , I am not crying,27
NA,about i t ; but I object to tbe coal-miners,27
NA,being insulted in such a way. They would,27
NA,not regard i t as a punishment to have to,27
NA,"defend their country. I n any case, tbe",27
NA,honorable member for New England,27
NA,( Mr Abbott) need not work himself into,27
NA,a passion. Section 49 of the Defence,27
NA,"Act guarantees, for this country, a force",27
NA,adequate for its defence. I believe that,27
NA,had i t not been for tbat section of tbe,27
NA,act this country would bave been denuded,27
NA,"of its natural defenders, just as I believe",27
NA,that New Zealand has been denuded of its,27
NA,defenders. I believe tbat we should,28
NA,retain in this country a force adequate,28
NA,for its defence; and therefore I am,28
NA,opposed to tbe compulsory sending of,28
NA,more of our men abroad. I hope tbat,28
NA,my amendment will be agreed to.,28
Mr CALWELL , I second the amend-,28
NA,ment and reserve my right to speak.,28
Sir CHARLES MARR ,Parkes),28
NA,[4.45] -The House has been called to-,28
NA,gether for the specific purpose of hearing,28
NA,a statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr.,28
NA,Curtin) on the war position. We are glad,28
NA,to have had the report that the right hon-,28
NA,orable gentleman has placed before us to-,28
NA,day. The speech that he made shows the,28
NA,seriousness of the position that obtains,28
NA,throughout the world. Honorable mem-,28
NA,"bers, however, expected to hear something",28
NA,in regard to the way in which Australia,28
NA,was to play its part in conjunction with,28
NA,its allies in driving the enemy from,28
NA,occupied territories and in preventing it,28
NA,from attacking our own. We have,28
NA,listened to the remarks of the honorable,28
NA,member for Bourke ( Mr Blackburn).,28
Mr CALWELL ,"Ver y wise ones, too.",28
Sir CHARLES MARR ,H e prefaced,28
NA,them by giving notice of an amendment,28
NA,that he proposed to move for the addi-,28
NA,tion to the motion of words that would,28
NA,prevent the introduction of conscription,28
NA,"for military service abroad. Many of us,",28
NA,"in our hearts, are opposed to con-",28
NA,"scription as such. But I have, in this",28
NA,"Parliament during this war, consis-",28
NA,"tently supported it. The workers, above",28
NA,"all others, should be prepared to fight",28
NA,in defence of privileges and rights which,28
NA,have been handed down to them,28
NA,by their forbears. The speech of the,28
NA,honorable member for Bourke would,28
NA,lead one to believe that we can cringe to,28
NA,our allies; that we can say to the United,28
NA,"States of America, New Zealand, Canada,",28
NA,"the British Isles, China, and all others",28
NA,"who are allied with us, ""For the Lord's",28
NA,"sake, come and help us; but, unfortu-",28
NA,"nately, we cannot go to your help "".",28
Mr CALWELL ,Whe n did the 'honor-,28
NA,able member change his mind ?,28
Sir CHARLES MARR , I bave never,28
NA,changed my mind on this matter.,28
Mr CALWELL ,Th e honorable member,28
NA,was an anti-conscriptionist six months,28
NA,ago.,28
Sir CHARLES MARR ,Never ! The,28
NA,people whom the honorable member for,28
NA,Bourke represents in this House-th e,28
NA,Communists-ar e to-day the most out-,28
NA,spoken in favour of conscription.,28
Mr CALWELL , I rise to a point of,28
NA,order. Is the honorable member i n order,28
NA,in accusing the honorable member for,28
NA,Bourke of being the representative of the,28
NA,Communists in this Parliament? Is it,28
NA,not a fact that the honorable member for,28
NA,"Bourke represents the electors of Bourke,",28
NA,and no one else?,28
Mr SPEAKER ,Objectio n to any,28
NA,remark must be made by the honorable,28
NA,member concerned.,28
Mr BLACKBURN ,Wha t the honorable,28
NA,member has said will not do me any,28
NA,harm. ',28
- Sir CHARLES MARR ,I f the honor-,28
NA,able member for Bourke is hurt by what,28
NA,"I bave said, I withdraw it. I have too",28
NA,"much respect for his convictions, and",28
NA,"his attitude i n this House, to ""throw",28
NA,"stones "" at him. He has a right to his",28
NA,"opinions, and be has been courageous",28
NA,enough to voice them. I t appears to me,28
NA,that responsibility for the present lack of,28
NA,"man-power, which is so much deplored,",28
NA,must be laid at tbe door of Ministers.,28
NA,I t has been considered necessary to issue,28
NA,regulations in respect of tbe employment,28
NA,"of domestic help, in order to obtain more",28
NA,women for engagement in war activities.,28
NA,"Surely, i f Ministers were to abolish the",28
NA,loading that is evident in some of our,28
NA,munitions establishments and other,28
NA,"activities, i f the employees could be en-",28
NA,couraged to devote their full energies to,28
NA,the war effort instead of slacking and,28
NA,"making overtime necessary, much better",28
NA,results would accrue. Our sister dominion,28
NA,of New Zealand has always had compul-,28
NA,sory service. New Zealanders served,28
NA,"during the last war, and have again on",28
NA,"this occasion, not where they desired, but",28
NA,where the advisers of the Government of,28
NA,that dominion considered that they could,28
NA,best be engaged. Has the honorable mem-,28
NA,"ber for Bourke, the honorable memiber for",28
NA,"Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), or any other",28
NA,"honorable member, with the possible ex-",28
NA,ception of the honorable member for,28
NA,Batman ( Mr Brennan)-wh o bas de-,28
NA,nounced the British Navy-eve r de-,28
NA,nounced' the provision that requires any,28
NA,member of tbe Royal Australian. Navy,29
NA,to serve wherever required? Those men,29
NA,are not invited to enlist to serve only in,29
NA,"Australian waters. On one occasion, I",29
NA,heard the honorable member for Batman,29
NA,say that they were a menace to mankind.,29
Mr BRENNAN ,Neve r in my life.,29
Sir CHARLES MARR ,That,29
NA,ment appears in Hansard.,29
Mr BRENNAN ,I t does not.,29
Sir CHARLES MARR ,-I s the hon-,29
NA,orable member now in favour of the,29
NA,regulations relating to tbe enlistment of,29
NA,men in the Royal Australian Navy?,29
Mr BRENNAN ,Tha t is a vastly dif-,29
NA,ferent proposition.,29
Sir CHARLES MARR ,I s the honor-,29
NA,able member in favour of the regulations,29
NA,relating to the enlistment of members of,29
NA,the Royal Australian Air Force?,29
Mr BRENNAN , I do not think so; but,29
NA,I do not know what they are.,29
Sir CHARLES MARR ,Member s of,29
NA,"the Royal Australian A i r Force, the",29
NA,"Royal Australian Navy, and the Mer-",29
NA,"cantile Marine, can be sent to serve any-",29
NA,where. One cannot enlist in the A i r,29
NA,"Force to serve only in Australia, but must",29
NA,be prepared to go wherever one's services,29
NA,can best be used.,29
Mr CALWELL ,Bu t one enlists,29
NA,voluntarily.,29
Sir CHARLES MARR ,On enlists,29
NA,voluntarily in other organizations. My,29
NA,"quarrel with the Government is, that i t",29
NA,does not go far enough in the application,29
NA,of compulsion. I t ought not to make,29
NA,the Parliament an exempt establishment.,29
Mr CALWELL ,I s the honorable,29
NA,member in favour of compulsory,29
NA,unionism ?,29
Sir CHARLES MARR ,I f the hon-,29
NA,orable member is in favour of compulsory,29
NA,"unionism, he ought to be in favour o'f",29
NA,-compulsory service for the defence of,29
NA,those things for which unionism has,29
NA,fought and won battles. Honorable,29
NA,members who sit on the Government,29
NA,benches never raise their voices against,29
NA,enlistment in the Navy or the Air Force;,29
NA,yet they contend that members of the,29
NA,Citizen Military Forces must serve only,29
NA,in Australian territory! I t appears to,29
NA,me that some Ministers give indirect en-,29
NA,couragement to those who desire to avoid,29
NA,"service, by finding positions for them in",29
NA,Government departments. One depart-,29
NA,ment in Sydney contains a large number,29
NA,of eligible men. Yet men of 59 years of,29
NA,age bave been industrially conscripted I,29
NA,The men in that category are not invited,29
NA,to say whether they will serve near their,29
NA,"homes in Melbourne or Sydney, but may",29
NA,be sent to the farthest parts of Queens-,29
NA,"state- land, or elsewhere. Was the honorable",29
NA,member for Melbourne in favour of that,29
NA,industrial conscription ?,29
Mr CALWELL ,Th e honorable mem-,29
NA,ber was.,29
Sir CHARLES MARR , I did not,29
NA,vote for it. But I am in favour of con-,29
NA,"scription for every war activity, and",29
NA,would put a man to work in a munitions,29
NA,factory or any other undertaking in,29
NA,which he was best fitted to serve. I n a,29
NA,"factory that I visited, a foreman told me",29
NA,that women who were engaged on the,29
NA,"production of shells, were, after three",29
NA,"months' experience, making twenty shells",29
NA,a unit a shift more than trained men. I,29
NA,have informed the Minister for the Army,29
NA,that thousands of Australians who volun-,29
NA,tarily went overseas in order to prevent,29
NA,"the enemy from approaching our shores,",29
NA,and escaped from countries to which their,29
NA,"activities had taken them, are now en-",29
NA,gaged in guerrilla warfare in the hills of,29
NA,"Java, in Timor, and i n other islands of",29
NA,the Pacific. The Government says:,29
NA,""" They are outside Australian territory.",29
NA,They were fools enough to enlist; let,29
NA,e,29
NA,them stew in their own juice. We shall,29
NA,not compel any Australian to rescue them,29
NA,"and bring them back "". That is the view",29
NA,that honorable members opposite held in,29
NA,"the last war, and one cannot expect them",29
NA,to change it. They will not oblige their,29
NA,good trade unionists friends to serve i f it,29
NA,be possible for them to avoid service. The,29
NA,Prime Minister's eloquence and ability,29
NA,are of no avail. I t is shameful tbat tbe,29
NA,"leader of the country, the first man in",29
NA,"the nation, should have to seek the direc-",29
NA,tion of an outside junta as to the way in,29
NA,which he should lead this country.,29
Mr CALWELL ,Doe s not the honorable,29
NA,member go to an outside junta?,29
Sir CHARLES MARR , I have never,29
NA,been to one in my life.,29
Mr CALWELL ,Di d not Mr Bruce go,29
NA,to Collins House ?,29
Sir CHARLES MARR ,No . Neither,29
NA,Mr Bruce nor the right honorable mem-,29
NA,ber for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes),29
NA,went to any outside junta. I n the last,30
NA,"war, the right honorable member for",30
NA,North Sydney led this country as a leader,30
NA,should. What did the Labour party do?,30
NA,I t did to him what it would do to John,30
NA,"Curtin, i f that right honorable gentleman",30
NA,were to do the right and noble thing,30
NA,without fear of consequences; but be,30
NA,would find that the country was solidly,30
NA,behind him. I t would be a waste of time,30
NA,to try to convince my friends opposite,30
NA,that their colleagues in the unions are,30
NA,opposed to their attitude.,30
Mr CALWELL ,'Ho w does the honor-,30
NA,able member like the idea of the Com-,30
NA,munists supporting him?,30
Sir CHARLES MARR , I welcome,30
NA,the co-operation of anybody who can assist,30
NA,to win the war. I have listened with great,30
NA,pleasure to the representative of the,30
NA,munists in the Sydney Domain. I f he,30
NA,could make a speech in this House to my,30
NA,"friends opposite, he would open their",30
NA,eyes and show them how they should act.,30
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,O n a point of,30
NA,"order, I should like to know whether the",30
NA,motion should be discussed in tbe absence,30
NA,of every member of the Ministry. Not,30
NA,one of His Majesty's Ministers is on the,30
NA,"treasury bench, and the proceedings are",30
NA,entirely out of order.,30
NA,"Mr Scully having entered the chamber,",30
Sir CHARLES MARR ,Th e amend-,30
NA,ment has placed the Cabinet in a,30
NA,dilemma.,30
Mr CALWELL ,I t will place the hon-,30
NA,orable member in a dilemma later.,30
Sir CHARLES MARR ,I t will never,30
NA,place me in a dilemma. Because it pro-,30
NA,poses to add to the motion a declaration,30
NA,that in no circumstances shall conscrip-,30
NA,"tion be introduced, I cannot support i t ;",30
NA,"nor, in my opinion, can tbe Ministry or",30
NA,the members of the Labour party.,30
Mr CALWELL ,Tha t is our policy.,30
Sir CHARLES MARR ,I s it? Then,30
NA,why were workers conscripted indus-,30
NA,trially? Honorable members opposite,30
NA,say that they represent the workers,30
NA,in this Parliament. A l l that I can,30
NA,"say is, "" God help the workers who",30
NA,"have that sort of representation"".",30
NA,I f the honorable member for Mel-,30
NA,bourne bad blood relations serving over-,30
NA,"seas, he might take a different view.",30
NA,"Since the 11th July last, I have been",30
NA,fighting the Minister for the Army on,30
NA,"behalf of men who, having fought vali-",30
NA,antly for the defence of this country,30
NA,"throughout the campaigns in Greece, Crete",30
NA,"and Syria, were tried by court martial in",30
NA,the Middle East because of what they had,30
NA,done when an officer who had never been,30
NA,in action marched them over the desert,30
NA,in order to give them further training.,30
NA,These men were tried for mutiny and,30
NA,"sentenced to 26 months' imprisonment,",30
NA,some being imprisoned in Pentridge and,30
NA,others at Long Bay. I shall never cease,30
NA,to oppose such treatment. I t is monstrous,30
NA,that a Labour government should put,30
NA,soldiers who volunteered to fight for their,30
NA,country in gaol with common criminals.,30
NA,This is the first time that it has,30
NA,ever been done by any Australian,30
NA,government. No civilian can be placed,30
NA,Com- in a gaol with criminals until he has,30
NA,been tried by a jury and found guilty,30
NA,of the offence of which he was charged.,30
NA,"I f these soldiers were guilty, they",30
NA,could have served their sentences in,30
NA,"concentration camps, but they should not",30
NA,have been put into gaols with criminals.,30
NA,I have been fighting this case ever since,30
NA,the 11th July last. Only to-day I received,30
NA,a letter from the Prime Minister to say,30
NA,that he understood that the matter which,30
NA,I had brought under his notice had been,30
NA,dealt with by the Minister for the Army.,30
NA,I may say that I have never once received,30
NA,an affirmative reply from the Minister,30
NA,for the Army on any subject.,30
Mr SPEAKER , Tbe honorable,30
NA,member must confine himself more closely,30
NA,to the subject-matter of the amendment.,30
Sir CHARLES MARR ,Th e Prime,30
NA,Minister made a very comprehensive,30
NA,statement which took us into many fields.,30
NA,He travelled from the Philippines to the,30
NA,Middle East. I have not yet gone so far;,30
NA,I have not even got to Europe yet. Mr.,30
NA,"Miles, the Communist, said in the Sydney",30
NA,Domain recently that he did not,30
NA,care whether we had one army or ten so,30
NA,long as we all combined to chase those,30
NA,little yellow swine back to their holes in,30
NA,Japan. Do honorable members think,30
NA,that we can defeat Japan by passing,30
NA,resolutions in this House? I was dis-,30
NA,appointed that the Prime Minister did,30
NA,not finish his statement by making a re-,30
NA,port upon his attendance at the Australian,30
NA,Labour party conference in Melbourne.,30
NA,"I n my opinion, he had no right to go to",30
NA,the conference at all. I take it that he,31
NA,"attended as Prime Minister and, i f he",31
NA,visited one outside organization in that,31
NA,capacity he should visit all. Seeing,31
NA,"that he did go, he should have made a",31
NA,report to Parliament on his visit. He,31
NA,"should have said that, while Parliament",31
NA,"was in recess, he went to the Trades Hall",31
NA,and outlined the Government's proposals,31
NA,to the delegates there. He might have,31
NA,added that he was not quite sure whether,31
NA,those proposals would be turned down or,31
NA,accepted. I am curious to know what he,31
NA,proposes to do if the trade unions decide,31
NA,"against him. However, i t is not for us at",31
NA,this stage to make the way too hard for,31
NA,him. We must give him a chance to get,31
NA,"away with it i f he can, but I should like",31
NA,to know what he proposes to do i f he,31
NA,not get away with it.,31
NA,"Mr OAIAVTSLT, -H e will not join the",31
NA,"United Australia party, anyway.",31
Sir CHARLES MARR , I should like,31
NA,the leader of the Parliament to be,31
NA,the leader of the people. There should,31
NA,be complete unity at this time. We,31
NA,do not want political party divisions,31
NA,now. We should have a national govern-,31
NA,"ment, which would be representative of",31
NA,all the people. The Minister for the,31
NA,Army ( Mr Eorde) and the Minister,31
NA,for Air ( Mr Drakeford) flew to New,31
NA,"Guinea, and came back with harrowing",31
NA,"tales, but what could they have seen",31
NA,in a few days ? I happen to be one who,31
NA,"went over the Owen Stanley Range, and",31
NA,at one stage i t took more than 30 natives,31
NA,over four days to cut a track a mile long.,31
NA,Our men have played a noble paTt in,31
NA,"New Guinea, whether they be members",31
NA,of the Australian Imperial Force or the,31
NA,Citizen Military Forces. We should,31
NA,give to our military advisers the support,31
NA,which they bave a right to expect. I f,31
NA,they are worth having as advisers it is,31
NA,worth our while to accept their advice.,31
NA,The trouble is tbat we have too many,31
NA,pettifogging critics in this country who,31
NA,"can all tell the Army, the Navy and the",31
NA,Air Force how they are doing things,31
NA,wrongly. The Australian Imperial Force,31
NA,was brought back from overseas and,31
NA,.split up among Militia units. What is,31
NA,to happen i f the Government's pro-,31
NA,posal for merging the two forces be not,31
NA,eiven effect? I suppose tbe men will be,31
NA,"lined up and an officer will say, ""Hands",31
NA,up all those who are members of the Aus-,31
NA,tralian Imperial Force. Take two paces,31
NA,to the front. Those who are not of. the,31
NA,Australian Imperial Force will stay at,31
NA,"home and look after the women."" Armies",31
NA,do not fight as individuals; they are,31
NA,"trained and fight as organizations, and",31
NA,that applies with greater force than ever,31
NA,in these days of mechanization. Much,31
NA,as I admire the honorable member for,31
NA,Bourke ( Mr Blackburn) and much as I,31
NA,"like to listen to his speeches, I cannot",31
NA,support his amendment.,31
Mr BRENNAN ,Batman) [5.9] - I,31
NA,think that it may be candidly admitted-,31
NA,because I feel that I cannot honestly,31
NA,deny it-tha t Government supporters,31
NA,does find themselves in the present circum-,31
NA,stances in a very embarrassing position,31
NA,in regard to discussions upon defence,31
NA,measures. The Prime Minister ( Mr.,31
NA,"Curtin) has made a statement, and moved",31
NA,that the paper be printed. Tbe honor-,31
NA,able member for Bourke ( Mr Blackburn),31
NA,has moved an amendment affirming the,31
NA,desirability of maintaining the historic,31
NA,Labour policy regarding conscription for,31
NA,"overseas military service. To this policy,",31
NA,not one word of reference was made,31
NA,"by the Prime Minister. Nevertheless,",31
NA,"as is well known, he had publicly made",31
NA,a declaration of an intention on bis part,31
NA,to depart from Labour's historic policy,31
NA,and to substitute a new one.,31
NA,The attitude of Labour has always been,31
NA,one of implacable opposition to overseas,31
NA,conscription. Tbat faith was so firmly,31
NA,held that many good Labourites and true,31
NA,thought that the principle should be em-,31
NA,bedded in the Australian Constitution so,31
NA,as to ensure its permanence. Most,31
NA,people who are interested in the Lab-,31
NA,our movement believe that its greatest,31
NA,"achievement, next to the famous attack",31
NA,made upon vested interests in the early,31
NA,'nineties during the period of the founda-,31
NA,"tion of the Labour party, was its repeated",31
NA,and continued resistance to the policy of,31
NA,compulsory military service in a foreign,31
NA,"country. To-day, our policv is still anti-",31
NA,"con scriptionist, but we meet this Parlia-",31
NA,ment in the extraordinary position that,31
NA,the leader of the party and the head of,31
NA,the Government has publicly declared his,31
NA,opposition to what many of us regard as,31
NA,"not merely a plank, but a cardinal prin-",31
NA,ciple of Labour policv. This new policy,31
NA,advocated by tbe Prime Minister bas not,32
NA,"yet been adopted. Indeed, i n my opinion,",32
NA,it is not likely to be adopted by the,32
NA,Labour movement. I f it 'had pleased the,32
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden),32
NA,to-day to move an amendment affirming,32
NA,allegiance to the principle of conscription,32
NA,"as laid down by the Prime Minister, the",32
NA,Prime Minister himself and every mem-,32
NA,ber of bis party would have been bound,32
NA,to oppose the motion- a most extra-,32
NA,ordinary position-jus t as they will be,32
NA,bound to support the spirit of the motion,32
NA,"of the honorable member for Bourke, as",32
NA,I most cordially do.,32
NA,"I t may as well, I think, be frankly",32
NA,admitted that we have been led into a,32
NA,position in which we are exposed to the,32
NA,ridicule and contempt not only of the,32
NA,"Opposition and our own supporters, but",32
NA,also of the electorate as a whole. Almost,32
NA,"every honorable member of this House,",32
NA,"certainly every party, has come from the",32
NA,"electors pledged and, so far as I know,",32
NA,continues to be pledged against the policy,32
NA,of conscription for service i n foreign,32
NA,"countries. There were, of course, some",32
NA,die-hards. Tbe honorable member for,32
NA,Bourke ( Mr Blackburn) excepts them,32
NA,in more pleasant words than I feel dis-,32
NA,posed to apply to them. There were,32
NA,"those of the Opposition, who piping very",32
NA,"loudly in this House, piped not so",32
NA,loudly in the electorate at the time that,32
NA,military service in foreign countries was,32
NA,regarded as very unpopular.,32
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,I f the honor-,32
NA,able member had accompanied me on the,32
NA,campaign he would have formed a dif-,32
NA,ferent opinion.,32
Mr BRENNAN ,Th e truth is that,32
NA,the great majority of the members of,32
NA,the Opposition exhibited extraordinary,32
NA,sensitiveness about any suggestion that,32
NA,they were favorable to conscription. I,32
NA,remember gravely offending a former,32
NA,"member of this Parliament, who was an",32
NA,"anti-conscriptionist of an earlier war, by",32
NA,suggesting that his protests of recent date,32
NA,against conscription for foreign service,32
NA,were not entirely genuine or sincere. I,32
NA,took that occasion to point out that it,32
NA,"was doubtful, i f they were submitted to",32
NA,"the test, whether Opposition members",32
NA,would not be shown to run true to form,32
NA,"and prove themselves, i n reality, con-",32
NA,scriptionists.,32
NA,I t must be admitted that there is little,32
NA,difference between the policy of the,32
NA,Labour party acting by its majority and,32
NA,that of the United Australia party and its,32
NA,"somewhat uncertain satellite, the Country",32
NA,party. I t must be granted that the,32
NA,sometimes doubt whether it should be,32
NA,Opposition is a kid-glove opposition. I,32
NA,described in its relationship with the,32
NA,"Government as a Siamese twin, or whe-",32
NA,ther the Country party and the Govern-,32
NA,ment are merely a married couple. I do,32
NA,"know, however, that the United Aus-",32
NA,tralia party's opposition to the Labour,32
NA,"Government, as at present constituted, is",32
NA,much more apparent than real. I do,32
NA,"know that the Leader of the Opposition,",32
NA,"so far as he is the leader, and not merely",32
NA,"a political accident, speaks much more",32
NA,valiantly than he acts. I do know that,32
NA,he makes statements of tremendous,32
NA,ferocity in tbe press and that he soft,32
NA,"pedals them remarkably in Parliament,",32
NA,and that finally he is wont to express his,32
NA,complete satisfaction with the explana-,32
NA,tion tendered by the Prime Minister.,32
NA,All differences 'between them end in,32
NA,pleasant felicitations exchanged between,32
NA,"""Jack "" and "" A r t i e "" , and there the",32
NA,"matter ends. The Advisory ""War Council",32
NA,is usually the incubator of these downy,32
NA,chickens of complete harmony. Nobody,32
NA,"wa3 surprised, therefore, to learn that",32
NA,the Opposition would spare us in the,32
NA,moment of our humiliation. Nobody,32
NA,was surprised to find that the Opposi-,32
NA,"tion, finding the Government through",32
NA,"its head, promising to ""go quiet"", de-",32
NA,cided that it should be encouraged,32
NA,rather than that it should suffer tbe,32
NA,indignity of forcible arrest. I f one had,32
NA,had an ear to the keyhole when the,32
NA,Opposition party meeting was being held,32
NA,on this matter of defence no doubt one,32
NA,would have heard that genial phrase-,32
NA,"maker, the right honorable member for",32
NA,.Kooyong ( Mr Menzies) suggesting that,32
NA,the Government should ibe allowed to,32
NA,stew in its own juice. I can quite,32
NA,imagine the honorable member for,32
NA,Barker ( Mr Archie Cameron) saying,32
NA,that they should not throw a stone at,32
NA,a stewpot of disruption which was,32
NA,already simmering nicely on the Labour,32
NA,hearth. I have said that there is little,33
NA,"difference between parties, and there is;",33
NA,but I always thought that anti-conscrip-,33
NA,tion was safer in the hands of the Labour,33
NA,party and a Labour Government than,33
NA,"any other party in this House, for",33
NA,reasons which I have already given.,33
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON , I think I told,33
NA,the honorable member at the 1939 elec-,33
NA,tion that it was not.,33
Mr BRENNAN ,"Yes , I believe so,",33
NA,and I myself said something in support,33
NA,of the honorable member's logic. I said,33
NA,that the honorable member might be,33
NA,"right. But there is an old saying, "" Once",33
NA,"a policeman always a policeman"". I do",33
NA,"not agree with that, because I know many",33
NA,"gentlemen who, having been very good",33
NA,"officers of police, have for many years",33
NA,since retirement proved themselves very,33
NA,"goodi citizens. But I do say, ""Once a",33
NA,"conscriptionist always a conscriptionist"".",33
NA,You can trace the continued presence of,33
NA,the virus. You know him as a conscrip-,33
NA,tionist even when he is most loudly pro-,33
NA,claiming himself an anti-conscriptionist.,33
NA,I f conscription for overseas service is,33
NA,"such a good thing, why bastardize it?",33
NA,Why call i t out of its name? Why,33
NA,"apologize for it? Why explain, ""We",33
NA,"do not mean conscription, we merely",33
NA,mean merge-on e army. We do not,33
NA,"mean territories far away in Europe,",33
NA,we merely mean lands-th e terri-,33
NA,"tories of foreign powers, certainly-",33
NA,"relatively near to Australia"" ? When",33
NA,the honorable member for Bourke,33
NA,was speaking on that subject he en-,33
NA,deavoured to define the indefinite and,33
NA,to tell us what was meant by the South-,33
NA,west Pacific. We might have hoped that,33
NA,he would tell us also what was meant by,33
NA,"the phrase "" associated with the defence",33
NA,"of Australia "" ; but the Prime Minister",33
NA,waxed a little indignant and said that,33
NA,these were secret matters which could not,33
NA,be disclosed. I hardly understand how,33
NA,we are to determine what we mean by,33
NA,"conscription in tlie South-west Pacific,",33
NA,unless the geographical area referred to,33
NA,"is disclosed, in the discussion on the",33
NA,amendment of the Defence Act. I make,33
NA,this further observation that the anxiety,33
NA,of the Prime Minister was a little belated,33
NA,because it appears that the definition bas,33
NA,already been published in a Sydney news-,33
NA,paper only this morning. I n the good,33
NA,old days when we were fighting con-,33
NA,"scription before, the Prime Minister did",33
NA,me the honour of presiding at a fateful,33
NA,"meeting which I addressed, at the Bijou",33
NA,"Theatre on the 4th July, 1915. He was",33
NA,then a militant opponent of conscription,33
NA,for overseas service. I n those days the,33
NA,men who stood for conscription were not,33
NA,ashamed of the name. They called i t for,33
NA,"what it was. The immortal "" B i l l y "" ,",33
NA,and men like Paddy Lynch and George,33
NA,"Pearce, all arch conscriptionists, advo-",33
NA,cated conscription without using euphem-,33
NA,isms. They said what they meant. They,33
NA,called a spade a spade. The reference,33
NA,to the two last gentlemen I have men-,33
NA,"tioned-wh o came from your own State,",33
Mr SPEAKER ,suggest s that the blossom,33
NA,of conscriptionflourishesremarkably well,33
NA,in the congenial atmosphere of Western,33
NA,Australia. The words used by the Prime,33
NA,"Minister in setting out his proposal were,",33
NA,"I think, sufiiciently clear to be under-",33
NA,stood. They were-,33
NA,"That, having regard to the paramount neces-",33
NA,"sity of Australia's defence, as expressed at the",33
NA,federal conference of the Australian Labour,33
NA,"party in June, 1940, the Government should be",33
NA,"authorized to add to the Defence Act, in the",33
NA,"definition of "" Commonwealth"", which at",33
NA,present defined the territory to which the act,33
NA,"extended, the following words:-''an d such",33
NA,other territories in the South-west Pacific,33
NA,area as the Governor-General proclaims as,33
NA,being territories associated with the defence of,33
NA,"Australia "".",33
Mr ABBOTT ,I s that official?,33
Mr BRENNAN , I am quoting from,33
NA,the Tabor Call. I hope that even,33
NA,though Labour policy may be some-,33
NA,what in the balance at the moment the,33
NA,honorable member for New England,33
NA,( Mr Abbott) will not regard i t as an,33
NA,offence for me to quote from a Labour,33
NA,newspaper. The words that I have,33
NA,quoted have been stated in many places.,33
NA,The words are sufficiently clear to remove,33
NA,all doubt that the Government desires,33
NA,power to compel the youth of Australia to,33
NA,serve in foreign countries. The general,33
NA,"intention of the proposal is, undoubtedly,",33
NA,conscription for service overseas. Such,33
NA,"phrases as "" South-west Pacific area "" or",33
NA,""" associated w i t h "" are not at all clear,",33
NA,but the general purpose of tbe proposal,33
NA,"is, beyond any question, to give the Go-",33
NA,vernment power to conscript Australian,33
NA,youth for military service in foreign,34
NA,"countries. I f this proposal were adopted,",34
NA,our young men could be sent against their,34
NA,"will anywhere in the world, according to",34
NA,the whim of the Government in power at,34
NA,"the time. The expression ""such other",34
NA,territories in the South-west Pacific area,34
NA,as the Governor-General proclaims as,34
NA,being territories associated with the,34
NA,"defence of Australia"" is broad enough",34
NA,"for anything. At the most, a further",34
NA,trifling amendment of the law would be,34
NA,required. I f this proposal should become,34
NA,"law, the policy of the Labour party in",34
NA,respect of military service would be,34
NA,entirely changed. I f we yield to the,34
NA,"present clamour for this amendment, we",34
NA,shall yield the last ditch. The proposal,34
NA,now before us is conscription for foreign,34
NA,"service, stark and unashamed. I n order",34
NA,to see clearly what is intended we must,34
NA,"follow the steps, one by one, which have",34
NA,"brought us to this position. I n 1940, when",34
NA,"the then honorable member for Corio,",34
NA,"Mr Casey, felt impelled to accept a safe",34
NA,"sinecure somewhere beyond Australia, a",34
NA,by-election was held for the Corio,34
NA,division. I n due course the representa-,34
NA,tion of the electorate passed to a com-,34
NA,"petent Labour man who, as Minister for",34
NA,"War Organization of Industry, has been",34
NA,"required to bear, personally, the en-",34
NA,venomed attacks of Labour's enemies,34
NA,"which should have been, and in ordinary",34
NA,"circumstances would have been, directed",34
NA,to the Government as a whole. The,34
NA,"Prime Minister, then Leader of the",34
NA,"Opposition, called the Victorian mem-",34
NA,bers of the party together and urged,34
NA,that the policy of Labour in respect of,34
NA,overseas service should he modified to a,34
NA,material degree. Later he acted upon,34
NA,the equivocal and doubtful approval,34
NA,which he received. He then acquiesced in,34
NA,"an enlargement of the definition of "" Aus-",34
NA,"tralia "" to include the Mandated Terri-",34
NA,tories. Still later he urged and encour-,34
NA,aged tbe sending of unlimited numbers of,34
NA,Australian troops to Malaya and other,34
NA,more or less adjacent areas. I t was not,34
NA,"his responsibility, but the responsibility",34
NA,"of the Government then in power, that",34
NA,"our men were sent to the Middle East, to",34
NA,"Crete, and to Greece so desperately i l",34
NA,"equipped that in the Middle East, at any",34
NA,"rate, the Australian commander refused",34
NA,to take them into action. I t was not the,34
NA,[01],34
NA,"present Prime Minister's responsibility,",34
NA,"but that of the present Opposition, that",34
NA,Australian troops were thrown into these,34
NA,"various distant theatres of war, where so",34
NA,many lost their lives. But it is only fair,34
NA,to admit that all of these movements had,34
NA,the ready acquiescence of the majority of,34
NA,the members of the then Opposition.,34
NA,"I have pointed out more than once, and",34
NA,so have certain other honorable members,34
NA,"on this side of the chamber, that con-",34
NA,scription was the inevitable result of such,34
NA,"a policy. Obviously, it would be neces-",34
NA,sary to reinforce troops sent to foreign,34
NA,countries: I f the men in Australia were,34
NA,not prepared to volunteer for such ser-,34
NA,"vice, it appeared to me to be inevitable",34
NA,that the Government of tbe day would,34
NA,ship them abroad compulsorily to fight,34
NA,"and-, i f necessary, to lay down their lives",34
NA,on foreign soil. There is a legal maxim,34
NA,that a man is presumed to intend the,34
NA,natural consequences of his acts. Many,34
NA,honorable gentlemen who supported tbe,34
NA,Prime Minister in this gradual process of,34
NA,breaking down Labour policy in respect of,34
NA,overseas military service did not perhaps,34
NA,"realize the natural results of their actions,",34
NA,but I have too high an opinion of tbe,34
NA,intelligence of the right honorable gentle-,34
NA,man to believe that he did not realize what,34
NA,must be the inevitable result of his policy.,34
NA,Inasmuch as Labour policy is opposed,34
NA,to compulsory service in foreign countries,34
NA,-an d we on this side of the House are,34
NA,under an obligation to defend that policy,34
NA,at this moment- I must confess that,34
NA,I have never heard the Prime Minis-,34
NA,ter make a forthright declaration against,34
NA,the principle of conscription. I have,34
NA,never heard him made a positive,34
NA,declaration that conscription for,34
NA,overseas military service was a hateful,34
NA,"thing, or that it was an unchangeable and",34
NA,deep-rooted belief of the Labour party,34
NA,that the bodies of Australian youth,34
NA,should not be seized and rendered up as,34
NA,a sacrifice in foreign countries against,34
NA,their will.,34
NA,When the Leader of tbe Opposition.,34
NA,( Mr Fadden) moved the adjournment of,34
NA,the House some time ago to discuss this,34
NA,"l - subject, the present Prime Minister re-",34
NA,plied to him on purely strategical,34
NA,grounds. He said the course suggested,34
NA,"was not necessary, that other courses were",34
NA,"open, and that conscription would divide",34
NA,the people. Tliere is one matter upon,35
NA,which the Prime Minister is absolutely,35
NA,sincere. He believes that he is the,35
NA,greatest military strategist since Han-,35
NA,"nibal, not excluding Napoleon Bonaparte.",35
NA,His opposition .to the proposal of the,35
NA,Leader of the Opposition was based on,35
NA,"military considerations, not on principle.",35
NA,"I t will be remembered that a ""govern-",35
NA,"ment spokesman"" foreshadowed some",35
NA,months ago the proposal that the Prime,35
NA,Minister has now made. The honorable,35
NA,member f or Melbourne ( Mr Calwell),35
NA,"and I , as well as other honorable",35
NA,"members, addressed questions to the",35
NA,Prime Minister with the object of elicit-,35
NA,ing whether any person had authority to,35
NA,speak for the Government on the subject.,35
NA,"We wanted to know, particularly, who",35
NA,"was the "" Government Spokesman "". The",35
NA,reply to a searching question by me,35
NA,as to whether such a spokesman had any,35
NA,kind of governmental authority was:,35
NA,""" T h e answer must be ' N o ' "" . ' The",35
NA,"answer should have been: "" ' Yes,' but",35
NA,"must for political reasons be ' N o ' "" .",35
NA,The answer should be known. [Exten-,35
NA,sion of lime granted.] As a barrage of,35
NA,questions followed fro m the other side,35
NA,"of the House, honorable gentlemen i n",35
NA,opposition must have had their sus-,35
NA,picions.,35
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,No t,35
NA,"picions, but hopes.",35
Mr BRENNAN , I think that,35
NA,""" Government Spokesman "" had certain",35
NA,"knowledge, and that knowledge was not",35
NA,confined to him. That the head of,35
NA,the Government should spring upon,35
NA,the public a declaration of a radical,35
NA,change of policy of the kind here fore-,35
NA,"shadowed, without consulting his Cabinet,",35
NA,"or his party, the electorate to which he",35
NA,was pledged as a deeply dyed i n the wool,35
NA,"anti-conscriptionist, or even his A r m y",35
NA,"Minister, and without knowing whether",35
NA,"or not, at the very moment at which",35
NA,"was expounding his new policy, one of",35
NA,his f a i t h f u l Labour Ministers might-,35
NA,have been expounding the old policy is as,35
NA,amazing as i t is inexplicable. M y selfthey,35
NA,esteem in this matter is of minor imporone,35
NA,"tance to honorable members, but",35
NA,"great importance to me. I , too, am",35
NA,pledged against conscription for foreign I,35
NA,service; I renewed that pledge at tbe last,35
NA,"elections, and I was returned to this-",35
NA,Parliament f a i t h f u l l y to observe i t -,35
NA,"Most of my constituents, knowing my",35
NA,"beliefs, were confident that I would f a i t h -",35
NA,"f u l l y observe i t . Some of them knew that,",35
NA,"as a member of a Labour Government,,",35
NA,"and with Labour approval, I had visited",35
NA,Geneva as the head of an Australian.,35
NA,"Government delegation, and that there,",35
NA,in the presence of the representatives of,35
NA,"53 nations, I had declared that the Lab-",35
NA,our party of Australia was implacably,35
NA,opposed to the policy of conscription for,35
NA,"foreign service, through which, I ven-",35
NA,"tured to say-foolishly , as the event has-",35

NA,"the Australian Worker of Wednesday,",35
NA,"the 2nd December, a leading article by",35
NA,"my old friend Mr Boote, who has been",35
NA,associated with that newspaper so long,35
NA,and honorably as a champion of freedom.,35
NA,I n this well-reasoned article against con-,35
NA,scription he speaks for tlie great body of,35
NA,"the Labour party, and i n his concluding",35
NA,"words, referring to the fact that certain",35
NA,executive bodies had declared themselves,35
NA,favorably to the Prime Minister's new,35
NA,"policy, said-",35
NA,"Should the Prime Minister get his way, the",35
NA,State Labour executives or the Interstate,35
NA,susLabour Conference will have agreed to some-,35
NA,thing profoundly and nationally serious for,35
NA,which nothing worthy of being called justifica-,35

NA,In that event a mere handful of men will,35
NA,"have destroyed, at the request of a single",35
NA,"person, a principle which more than a million",35
NA,people established by their votes on two,35
NA,historic occasions.,35
NA,What Australia did in the last great wai,35
NA,commanded the world's admiration.,35
NA,And this applied not only to the deeds of,35
NA,"our soldiers on the_ fields of battle, but also",35
NA,to the magnificent determination of the nation,35
NA,to carry its love of freedom to the length of,35
NA,forbidding the conscription of its sons even in,35
NA,the hour of dire peril.,35
NA,he TUERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER REFERENDUM OK,35
NA,THIS ISSUE. ONLY THE NATION SHOULD,35
NA,REPEAL WHAT THE NATION HAS DECREED.,35
NA,If those who are to settle this vital question,35
NA,are as deep-thoughted as they are patriotic,35
NA,will decline to obliterate from our annals,35
NA,of the grandest decisions ever recorded by,35
NA,i t is of a democratic people.,35
NA,"Having carefully studied all the facts,",35
NA,am driven most reluctantly and,35
NA,"painfull y to the conclusion that, whilst",35
NA,other members of the Cabinet were,36
NA,making crystal clear their opposition to,36
NA,"conscription i n principle, the Prime",36
NA,Minister has never been in sympathy w i th,36
NA,the policy of the party on that vital issue.,36
Mr HARRISON ,Wentworth) [5.53].,36
NA,"-Durin g the last war, when the",36
NA,"boys "" on the other side"" wanted",36
NA,"a little relaxation, they took a charge",36
NA,of cordite out of a shell and jammed i t,36
NA,down the rat holes of the infested trenches.,36
NA,Having placed a necessary weight on top,36
NA,"of the cordite, they would ignite",36
NA,"it. Immediately, there would be",36
NA,a wild rush of rats out of the holes i n,36
NA,an effort to get away from the fumes of,36
NA,the cordite. The honorable member for,36
NA,Bourke ( Mr Blackburn) has put down,36
NA,the rat-holes on the Labour side tbe,36
NA,"biggest charge of cordite ever used, and",36
NA,honorable members have been scampering,36
NA,away i n order to dodge the fumes. This,36
NA,exhibition must cause the country grave,36
NA,concern. The division on the amendment,36
NA,"will be an extraordinary one, and I shall",36
NA,be most interested to witness i t . Imme-,36
NA,"diately the amendment was moved, mem-",36
NA,bers of the Cabinet went into conference;,36
NA,leaving the House without a single Minis-,36
NA,ter to take charge of the front bench,36
NA,until the honorable member for Barker,36
NA,( Mr Archie Cameron) drew attention,36
NA,to the fact. Consternation reigned,36
NA,supreme. I t is passing strange that,36
NA,"the honorable member for Bourke,",36
NA,"who is a Socialist, who possibly would",36
NA,"like to be known as a Communist, and",36
NA,"who certainly is a pacifist, should have",36
NA,introduced something that cuts right,36
NA,across the very principles of socialism.,36
NA,"As I view the matter, the fundamentals",36
NA,of a democracy are based on common,36
NA,"privilege. Indeed, democracy bas evolved",36
NA,"to its present stage only after a long,",36
NA,"bloody, and bitter struggle against auto-",36
NA,cracy. The privileges conferred by a,36
NA,democracy are enjoyed by every person,36
NA,in i t . I t is claimed by some per-,36
NA,sons that communism is the next step,36
NA,from democracy to the ultimate achieve-,36
NA,ment. I do not agree with them. But i t,36
NA,can at least be said that those privileges,36
NA,which are common to socialism and com-,36
NA,munism have been defended by the very,36
NA,means to which exception is now taken;,36
NA,"in other words, communism has reverted",36
NA,to the very elements of autocracy i n an,36
NA,"endeavour to defend its privileges, includ-",36
NA,ing the compulsion of every unit in tho,36
NA,communistic State. We regard democracy,36
NA,as more enlightened than communism.,36
NA,The honorable member for Bourke would,36
NA,resist any attempt by an autocracy to,36
NA,introduce autocratic methods; yet,36
NA,he is not prepared to call upon every,36
NA,individual i n the community to protect,36
NA,those communal privileges that we enjoy,36
NA,to-day. I know that i t is difficult in a,36
NA,democracy to furnish convincing evidence,36
NA,of the need for war. Every person who,36
NA,enjoys the comforts and privileges of a,36
NA,democracy seeks to preserve them selfishly,36
NA,"for himself, and is not prepared to forgo",36
NA,them. Democracy was designed to become,36
NA,"effective i n all its ethical relationships,",36
NA,"not i n a period of war, but i n a peaceful",36
NA,world. But when there are those who,36
NA,will not observe the fundamental prin-,36
NA,"ciples of democracy, but abuse the privi -",36
NA,"leges that make f o r peace, their own",36
NA,methods must be employed against them,36
NA,in order that the standards and privileges,36
NA,of democracy may be preserved. This,36
NA,is recognized by communism. Every per-,36
NA,son who considers that the privileges he,36
NA,enjoys are of sufficient worth to justify,36
NA,"the use of autocratic, dictatorship",36
NA,"methods in order to retain them, is pre-",36
NA,pared to use them.,36
NA,The supporters of the Government have,36
NA,used i t extensively fo r the recruitment,36
NA,of their industrial army. They claim to,36
NA,"be the champions of industrialism, to be",36
NA,the only persons who adequately repre-,36
NA,"sent the workers, and they have not",36
NA,hesitated to exercise dictatorial powers,36
NA,for the conscription of their industrial,36
NA,"army. What, in the name of Heaven, is",36
NA,the use of conscripting an industrial army,36
NA,i f you are not prepared to conscript a,36
NA,military force to defend i t when its exist-,36
NA,ence is threatened?,36
Mr CALWELL ,Wha t about the con-,36
NA,scription of wealth?,36
Mr HARRISON , I f taxation at the,36
NA,rate of 18s. i n the £1 does not repre-,36
NA,sent a pretty f a i r measure of conscription,36
NA,"of wealth, I do not know what would;",36
NA,"and moreover, those who are paying at",36
NA,that rate are not squealing. A l l our,36
NA,boasted industrial and social standards,36
NA,would go by the board i f Australia were,36
NA,successfully invaded. No one with any,36
NA,common sense would pretend that Aus-,37
NA,tralia can be defended by waiting within,37
NA,the borders of Australia to meet an,37
NA,invading enemy. It has always been a,37
NA,cardinal principle of military strategy,37
NA,"to fight your wars, if possible, in tbe",37
NA,enemy's territory. Germany knows that.,37
NA,Germany has never fought a war on its,37
NA,own soil since tbe time of Napoleon.,37
NA,Japan adheres to the same principle. I,37
NA,do not say that we should become unduly,37
NA,"aggressive, but we must recognize that",37
NA,it is necessary to employ force to uphold,37
NA,our democratic principles and privileges,37
NA,when they are threatened by an enemy.,37
NA,Now the honorable member for Bourke,37
NA,"( Mr Blackburn), the arch-priest of",37
NA,"socialism, has directed a dagger at the",37
NA,heart of democracy and socialism. The,37
NA,"Prime Minister, as a champion of",37
NA,"democracy, must admit that Parliament",37
NA,is necessarily the highest tribunal in the,37
NA,land. It is an assembly of the repre-,37
NA,"sentatives of the people, and it is a duty",37
NA,of those representatives to make laws for,37
NA,the good order and government of the,37
NA,country. I have no wish to traverse the,37
NA,Prime Minister's record during tbe last,37
NA,"war, nor the record of some of his",37
NA,Ministers during that time. I believe that,37
NA,"the Prime Minister, by his diligence,",37
NA,"energy and patriotism during this war,",37
NA,has wiped out many blots on his,37
NA,escutcheon. Would to God that he would,37
NA,go a little farther in the interests of his,37
NA,"country! Unfortunately, he is restricted",37
NA,"by party affiliations, and there can be",37
NA,"no great leader in this country, or in",37
NA,"any other, who is prepared to bow the",37
NA,"knee to party dictatorship. Therefore,",37
NA,the Prime Minister must still be regarded,37
NA,as a political opportunist. As Leader,37
NA,"of the Opposition, he resisted the despatch",37
NA,overseas of an expeditionary force until,37
NA,the logic of events forced him to change,37
NA,his attitude. He resisted the participa-,37
NA,tion of Australia in the Empire Air,37
NA,Training Scheme until events forced him,37
NA,to withdraw his opposition. He resisted,37
NA,the merging of the Australian Imperial,37
NA,Force and the Citizen Military Forces,37
NA,until he was forced by events to agree,37
NA,to it. He declared that be would not,37
NA,"be bound by debate, and that the require-",37
NA,ments of General MACArthur would not,37
NA,have to wait upon political considera-,37
NA,"tions. Nevertheless, when a request is",37
NA,Mr Harrison.,37
NA,made that he should follow a line of,37
NA,action necessary for the preservation of,37
NA,"Australia, be does not come to Parlia-",37
NA,"ment, but by back-door methods",37
NA,"approaches a group of union secretaries,",37
NA,"an industrial and political junta, and",37
NA,tells them what must be done in order,37
NA,"to save the country, while withholding",37
NA,that information from the elected repre-,37
NA,sentatives of the people. He even refuses,37
NA,to allow the matter to be debated in his,37
NA,"own caucus. This is the man who, at",37
NA,"the moment, is Prime Minister of",37
NA,"Australia, the leader of the nation, the",37
NA,man against whom a member of his,37
NA,own party has directed an amendment,37
NA,designed to reassert the rights of indi-,37
NA,vidual members who refuse to be tricked,37
NA,by methods which are other than straight.,37
NA,I wish here and now to register my,37
NA,protest against the gratuitous insult,37
NA,which has been offered to the people of,37
NA,Australia through their elected represen-,37
NA,tatives by the Prime Minister in seeking,37
NA,tbe permission of an irresponsible poli-,37
NA,tical junta to introduce legislation vitally,37
NA,affecting the welfare of the country. And,37
NA,"these outsiders, instead of being im-",37
NA,pressed by the fact that they have been,37
NA,treated as the power behind the Govern-,37
NA,"ment, as a set of all-powerful political",37
NA,"commissars, have refused to give the",37
NA,authority for which the Prime Minister,37
NA,"asked, and have told him to come back on",37
NA,"the 4th January for their decision. "" Or",37
NA,"better still,"" they say, "" try to convince",37
NA,"those who are less than we are, but",37
NA,greater than you-th e members of the,37
NA,"State executives."" Such a situation can-",37
NA,not be tolerated in Australia or in any,37
NA,other democratic country. The Prime,37
NA,Minister must answer to the people of,37
NA,Australia for what he has done. I am,37
NA,in complete accord with .the Leader of,37
NA,tbe Opposition on this issue. I cannot,37
NA,"support the amendment, because I believe",37
NA,that it threatens the very existence of,37
NA,democracy. I believe in conscription,37
NA,because I know it to be necessary i f we,37
NA,are to preserve tbe rights and privileges,37
NA,which we enjoy.,37
Mr FROST ,Fo r two years the honor-,37
NA,able member supported a government,37
NA,which never had the courage to bring in,37
NA,conscription.,37
Mr HARRISON ,M y attitude on,38
NA,this matter has always been straight-,38
NA,"forward, and will bear any investigation.",38
NA,I hope that as much may be said of the,38
NA,attitude of the Minister for Repatriation,38
NA,( Mr Frost) when the division is taken,38
NA,on this amendment. .,38
NA,Sitting suspended from 6.10 to 8 p.m.,38
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne) [8.0] -,38
NA,I support tbe amendment moved by,38
NA,honorable member for Bourke ( Mr two,38
NA,Blackburn). I am at a loss to,38
NA,why the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.,38
NA,"Fadden), with all his fire and argument",38
NA,"in recent weeks, was unable to screw",38
NA,himself to the point of moving an amendexecutives,38
NA,ment to-day in accordance witb the policy,38
NA,which he has expressed and applied for,38
NA,some time past. Why did his courage,38
NA,evaporate when it came to the. question,38
NA,of submitting an amendment on the 10th,38
NA,December in identical terms witb,38
NA,"motion he submitted in this House on,",38
NA,"of all days, the 1st May last? I take",38
NA,that be is quite satisfied at tbe moment,38
NA,with the stepping-stone instalment of,38
NA,conscription which he hopes will receive,38
NA,the approval of the Labour party conalteration,38
NA,ference on the 4th January next. As,38
NA,"youth, I was an anti-conseriptionist",38
NA,"the 1916 and 1917 campaigns, and I am",38
NA,as much an anti-conseriptionist i n 1942. electorate.,38
NA,"I see no fundamental difference, and I",38
NA,moved a resolution at the meeting of the,38
NA,Victorian Central Executive of the,38
NA,tralian Labour party expressing the view,38
NA,that there was no fundamental difference,38
NA,between tbe proposals enunciated by tbe,38
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Curtin) in 1942,38
NA,and those enunciated by the right honorthe,38
NA,able member for North Sydney ( Mr made,38
NA,Hughes) in 1916. To me i t does not,38
NA,matter where a man goes after he leaves,38
NA,Australian territory on compulsory,38
NA,vice. To me geography does not matter.,38
NA,Whether the compulsion is for the Southissue,38
NA,"west Pacific or for Europe, i t is endorsed",38
NA,still military conscription for overbetween,38
NA,"seas service, and, therefore, abhorof",38
NA,rent to the traditional democratic,38
NA,"principles of this country, and something",38
NA,that should be abhorred and shunned.,38
NA,"Whether they were honest or not, memobligations",38
NA,"bers of the Opposition, in tbe early",38
NA,"of this war, agreed with members of the",38
NA,Labour party in expressing their detestawith,38
NA,"tion of this obnoxious thing, and, as",38
NA,"has been pointed out, tbe right honor-",38
NA,able member for Kooyong ( Mr Menzies),38
NA,"as Prime Minister went so far, witb the",38
NA,unanimous support of his Government,38
NA,"and bis party, as to incorporate i n the",38
NA,National Security Act a provision that,38
NA,regulations under that act should not be,38
NA,used for forcing conscription for over-,38
NA,"seas service"" upon tbe people of this",38
NA,the country. The people of Australia on,38
NA,occasions rejected conscription. The,38
NA,know then Labour Prime Minister went,38
NA,around the Labour executives of tbe Com-,38
NA,monwealth in the same way as the pre-,38
NA,sent Prime Minister has toured the,38
NA,in his day. The leader of,38
NA,the Labour party to-day was no more,38
NA,successful in Victoria in 1942 than the,38
NA,then leader of the Labour party was in,38
NA,1916. The honorable member for Parkes,38
NA,( Sir Charles Marr) and the honorable,38
NA,the member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison),38
NA,day see something to be greatly deplored in,38
NA,i t tbe fact that Labour Prime Ministers,38
NA,go to the bodies that create Labour,38
NA,governments and consult with them in the,38
NA,democratic way on the question of the,38
NA,of the party's platform. How,38
NA,a would they make their wishes known,38
NA,in except in conference?,38
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Ther e is the,38
Mr CALWELL ,Th e Labour move-,38
NA,ment in this country is the expression in,38
NA,Ausour time of tbe protest against the,38
NA,forces of reaction and privilege. The,38
NA,Labour movement in Australia has always,38
NA,obliged its parliamentary representatives,38
NA,to give an account of their actions to,38
NA,movement which created them and,38
NA,"their political existence possible,",38
NA,aud when it was displeased witb their,38
NA,actions it told them that it no longer,38
NA,serwanted their company. I t did that to,38
NA,members of the party on the conscription,38
NA,"in 1916, and the rank and file",38
NA,its action. I can see no conflict,38
NA,the position of a Labour member,38
NA,this Parliament and that of,38
NA,any other member of this Parlia-,38
NA,ment. The electors in choosing represen-,38
NA,tatives know the party allegiance and the,38
NA,of membership of the respec-,38
NA,days tive parties. Honorable memhers oppo-,38
NA,site talk about juntas while they consult,38
NA,big financial interests who give them,38
NA,their financial support and pay their,39
NA,expenses. Was it not a certain person,39
NA,named Sir Kelso King in New South,39
NA,"Wales who, as chairman of the Consulta-",39
NA,"tive Council of the National Union, col-",39
NA,"lected from £60,000 to £100,000 at elec-",39
NA,tion times to pay for all the propaganda,39
NA,members of the United Australia party,39
NA,put out to secure their return to parlia-,39
NA,ment? These people opposite are crea-,39
NA,tures of the financial interests. They are,39
NA,here to ensure that the present capitalist,39
NA,order of society shall be maintained and,39
NA,perpetuated. We are here as Labour,39
NA,members to ensure that the present order,39
NA,of society shall be replaced by another,39
NA,one in which production will be based,39
NA,upon use and not upon profits. There,39
NA,is a very wide distinction between the,39
NA,Labour movement and the people who,39
NA,sii opposite.,39
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,I s the honor-,39
NA,"able member speaking for ""brother""",39
NA,Coles ?,39
Mr CALWELL ,H e can give his own,39
NA,testimony in due course. The capitalistic,39
NA,society which honorable members oppo-,39
NA,site defend was well described a few years,39
NA,ago as a system of anarchy plus a police,39
NA,force. We on this side believe that the,39
NA,"capitalist forces of society, who want to",39
NA,conscript the young manhood of this coun-,39
NA,"try to send them abroad, are concerned",39
NA,"not with the defence of Australia, but",39
NA,with the interests of big business-thos e,39
NA,who provided the funds for the conscrip-,39
NA,tion fight in the last war-th e land sharks,39
NA,and the profiteers and all the other,39
NA,enemies of society. The people who,39
NA,support conscription to-day outside this,39
NA,Parliament are the enemies of Australia.,39
Mr ABBOTT ,Wha t about those inside,39
NA,this Parliament?,39
Mr CALWELL ,Som e people inside,39
NA,Parliament support conscription because,39
NA,they have not the intellectual,39
NA,moral principle to do the right thing.,39
NA,One of the people supporting conscrip-,39
NA,tion is a gentleman named Sir Keith,39
NA,Murdoch. I n an article in the Melbourne,39
NA,Herald last night in support of one army,39
NA,this gentleman descended to the gutter,39
NA,and attempted to inflame the feelings of,39
NA,the Australian populace by starting a,39
NA,sectarian war and reflecting on certain,39
NA,people in this community of Irish birth.,39
NA,There are many people in Australia with,39
NA,Irish blood. I am one. None of my,39
NA,ancestors who came to this country came,39
NA,here later than 90 years ago. I am of,39
NA,"mixed lineage. I have Irish, Welsh and",39
NA,American blood and I am proud of my,39
NA,"ancestral strains. I , therefore, resent as",39
NA,one who is second generation Australian-,39
NA,"born, the attempts of this individual to",39
NA,stir up strife. I n his long article he,39
NA,used these words-,39
NA,As this is one of several questions of the,39
NA,"greatest seriousness in our nation, no aspect",39
NA,"must be shirked, and no feelings spared.",39
NA,"I do not propose, therefore, to shirk any",39
NA,issue and I do not propose to spare the,39
NA,feelings of Sir Keith Murdoch. This is the,39
NA,gentleman who sets himself up to dictate,39
NA,"the policy of Australia, who brought",39
NA,down the Federal Labour Government of,39
NA,"1932, who by various devious ways and",39
NA,means used his agents to try to bribe,39
NA,Labour members of this Parliament into,39
NA,"deserting the Labour movement, but",39
NA,failed. To the eternal credit of the mem-,39
NA,bers concerned they refused his offers to,39
NA,betray the Labour movement and suffered,39
NA,defeat at the polls rather than ensure,39
NA,continued membership of this Parliament,39
NA,by an act of treachery. I f there are any,39
NA,of them here who desire to speak on the,39
NA,subject they can speak for themselves.,39
NA,"I n 19.15 Sir Keith Murdoch, then plain",39
NA,"Mr Murdoch, went to Gallipoli. I quote",39
NA,"some extracts from Gallipoli Diary,",39
NA,"volume II . , by General Sir Ian",39

NA,me a visit to thank me for having stretched a,39

NA,"integrity or the world, Mr Murdoch!",39
NA,I had begun to wonder what had come over,39

NA,This gentleman who is attacking the,39

NA,Australia is engaged. The extract is as,40
NA,follows:-,40
NA,The following statement has been made in,40
NA,"letter to the Prime Minister, Australia, by",40
NA,Mr Murdoch,40
Mr MENZIES ,Si r Keith Murdoch's,40
NA,statements were not made under cover,40
NA,of parliamentary privilege as are the,40
NA,statements which the honorable member,40
NA,is now making.,40
Mr CALWELL , I am not taking,40
NA,advantage of parliamentary privilege.,40
NA,The extracts that I am reading are taken,40
NA,from a volume which can be obtained,40
NA,from the Parliamentary Library. Sir,40
NA,Ian Hamilton published the statements,40
NA,and i f Sir Keith Murdoch had so desired,40
NA,he could have taken action against that,40
NA,distinguished soldier in the law courts of,40
NA,England. He did not do so because he,40
NA,knew that Sir Ian Hamilton had stated the,40
NA,truth. No legal tribunal would have con-,40
NA,demned that gallant soldier for having,40
NA,stigmatized Murdoch as a menace to the,40
NA,I rule lives of the Australians serving on Gal-,40
NA,lipoli and to the successful prosecution of,40
NA,the general campaign. Murdoch has been,40
NA,a menace to Australia ever since he,40
NA,returned to this country.,40
Mr SPEAKER ,I f the honorable,40
NA,member does not observe my ruling 1,40
NA,shall ask him to resume his seat.,40
Mr CALWELL , I shall bow to your,40
NA,"ruling, sir, and shall make no further",40
NA,-references to the stolen cablegrams which,40
NA,- Sir Keith Murdoch published in later,40
NA,years and to the other details mentioned,40
NA,by Sir Ian Hamilton about the Gallipoli,40
NA,incidents.,40
NA,I f honorable gentlemen opposite do not,40
NA,desire me to speak about Sir Keith,40
NA,"Murdoch, who is one of their press allies",40
NA,"in this campaign, perhaps they will not",40
NA,interrupt me i f I read some of the,40
NA,opinions expressed iby the leaders of the,40
NA,Communist party who are now the,40
NA,allies of the United Australia party and,40
NA,consequently the allies of the right honor-,40
NA,able member for Kooyong. The Com-,40
NA,munist party had this to say a few,40
NA,months ago-,40
NA,The British Government was quite insincere,40
NA,in its negotiations for a peace front.,40
NA,At present the Communist party is allied,40
NA,with the United Australia party in the,40
NA,campaign for conscription. Only a few,40
NA,weeks ago the honorable member for While,41
NA,Parkes ( Sir Charles Marr) occupied a,41
NA,"seat, in company witb the leader of",41
NA,"Communist party, on a platform in",41
NA,Sydney Domain.,41
Sir CHARLES MARR ,Th e Minister for,41
NA,tbe Army ( Mr Forde) also occupied,41
NA,seat there.,41
Mr CALWELL , I wonder bow want,41
NA,honorable gentlemen opposite will enjoy,41
NA,"listening to some other views, expressed",41
NA,"earlier in the war, by the Communist",41
NA,party. Here is one-,41
NA,Soviet Russia was not going to be made a,41
NA,""" cat's-paw "" of British imperialism.",41
NA,Honorable gentlemen opposite are silent.,41
NA,They do not desire to be reminded,41
NA,these Communist views. Some members,41
NA,of the Opposition are moving uneasily,41
NA,"in their seats, but they cannot dispute",41
NA,the accuracy of my quotations. Here is,41
NA,another extract-,41
NA,The pact of non-aggression with Germany,41
NA,marked the complete defeat of British foreign,41
NA,"policy, which aimed at an anti-Soviet war, ticipating.",41
NA,with German fascism as the spearhead of the,41
NA,attack.,41
NA,By torpedoing the peace front the British,41
NA,Government opened the gates of war. Mr.,41
NA,Chamberlain and Lord Halifax are as much,41
NA,responsible for the war as Hitler.,41
NA,I have no doubt that various means will,41
NA,be taken by honorable gentlemen opposite,41
NA,to slide out of the difficulty in which,41
NA,they find themselves; but not even their,41
NA,"acrobatic capacity to ""float through the occupy.",41
NA,"air with the greatest of ease "" will enable",41
NA,them to evade the issues I am raising.,41
NA,"I have no doubt that, with the help of",41
NA,"the forensic skill of their legal advocates,",41
NA,"they will deny, as effectively, as they",41
NA,my statement that at present the United,41
NA,Australia party and the Communist concerning,41
NA,party are allied in an effort to force,41
NA,"conscription on this country, though",41
NA,"objects each party bas in view are,",41
NA,"doubt, very different.",41
Mr MENZIES , I shall have to ask,41
NA,leave to cross-examine the honorable comments:-,41
NA,gentleman.,41
Mr CALWELL ,"A t the moment the declared,",41
NA,right honorable member for Kooyong heartedly,41
NA,must listen to a few questions from me.,41
NA,I ask him i f he agrees witb the following,41
NA,view expressed by his friends in the Now,41
NA,Communist party.'-,41
NA,Soviet neutrality is the worst blow of all,41
NA,to the ruling class in the capitalist world.,41
NA,the imperialist powers are destroying,41
NA,"each other, the Soviet Government is stand-",41
NA,the ing aloof and strengthening itself.,41
NA,the Although these were the views of tbe,41
NA,"Communist party not long ago, tbat party",41
NA,is now doing its utmost to introduce con-,41
NA,a scription for overseas service. Most of,41
NA,"these eligible, non-combatant communists",41
NA,to keep their safe jobs in protected,41
NA,industries whilst forcing the youth of this,41
NA,"country to go abroad to fight, and, per-",41
NA,"haps, to die. On the other hand, in the",41
NA,security service of Australia there are,41
NA,many officers who owe their positions to,41
NA,the fact that they are wearing the right,41
NA,""" old school tie "". Many of these people",41
NA,"did not see a shot fired in the last war,",41
NA,of and they have no intention of seeing,41
NA,shots fired in this war. So we have our,41
NA,""" ersatz "" colonels and arm-chair generals",41
NA,"doing their best, through the United Aus-",41
NA,"tralia party and otherwise, to force other",41
NA,people into active participation in a war,41
NA,in which they have no intention of par-,41
NA,I have a very great respect for the,41
NA,military record of the honorable member,41
NA,"for Bendigo ( Mr Rankin), and in these",41
NA,remarks I am not referring to him or to,41
NA,any other honorable gentleman who saw,41
NA,service in the last war. I am referring,41
NA,to those who are using the present war,41
NA,to ensconce themselves in positions which,41
NA,they have neither right nor title to,41
NA,Never having seen military,41
NA,"service themselves, they are yet yelling",41
NA,for conscription for other people.,41
NA,Let us return for a moment to the,41
NA,Communist friends of the United Aus-,41
NA,"can, tralia party. Honorable gentlemen oppo-",41
NA,site are in a disordered state of mind,41
NA,these new colleagues of theirs.,41
NA,Perhaps while I am reading a little more,41
NA,the from a Communist publication they may,41
NA,no be able to collect their thoughts. I n,41
NA,the early stages of this war the Com-,41
NA,munist party published tbe following,41
NA,"At the beginning Of the war, Mr Curtin",41
NA,"""much to the satisfaction of the",41
NA,"imperialists, that the Labour party ""whole-",41
NA,""" supported the war. At the same",41
NA,"time, in a half-hearted way, he said that the",41
NA,Labour party was opposed to conscription and,41
NA,the sending of Australian troops overseas.,41
NA,there is a contradiction in whole-,41
NA,heartedly supporting the war and refusing to,41
NA,send troops overseas- a contradiction which is,41
NA,leading to a reversal of Labour party policy.,41
NA,Since the war compulsory military train-,42
NA,"ing, which is only one step from conscrip-",42
NA,"tion for overseas service, has been introduced,",42
NA,"and yet the Labour party, officially, has done",42
NA,very little about i t .,42
NA,The Communist party declares that not only,42
NA,"must no more troops be sent, but that those",42
NA,"Australians overseas must, at all cost, be",42
NA,withdrawn.,42
NA,Curtin's somersault recalls that at the,42
NA,"beginning of the last war, Hughes, Holman",42
NA,and other Labour leaders said they were,42
NA,"opposed to conscription. After a few months,",42
NA,"however, they were the chief advocates for",42
NA,conscription for overseas service.,42
NA,The threat of conscription hangs over the,42
NA,working-class movement once again. I f the,42
NA,"Labour movement is to fight i t successfully,",42
NA,"we must be united, not only in our opposition",42
NA,"to conscription, but to the imperialist war",42
NA,as well.,42
NA,Yet these are the people who are to-day,42
NA,outbidding the Opposition in hysterical,42
NA,appeals to the Government to apply,42
NA,conscription in Australia so tbat Aus-,42
NA,tralian troops may be sent beyond the,42
NA,territorial limits of this country.,42
Mr HARRISON ,'Wh y does not the,42
NA,honorable gentlemen deliver the speech,42
NA,he intended to deliver before 7.30 p.m.?,42
Mr CALWELL ,M y speech has not,42
NA,been changed one iota in the dinner,42
NA,hour. The honorable member for Went-,42
NA,worth was a conscriptionist during tbe,42
NA,"last war, and an anti-conseriptionist",42
NA,during the early days of this war. He has,42
NA,now become a conscriptionist again.,42
Mr HARRISON , I was always a con-,42
NA,scriptionist.,42
Mr CALWELL ,Th e proposals elabo-,42
NA,rated to-day by tbe Leader of tbe Opposi-,42
NA,tion are designed to introduce conscrip-,42
NA,tion i n Australia so that our troops may,42
NA,be sent to Europe or anywhere else in,42
NA,the world. Honorable members of the,42
NA,present Opposition were responsible for,42
NA,"sending Australians to Greece and Crete,",42
NA,to parts of the Middle East and to Africa.,42
NA,The Prime Minister has told us that bis,42
NA,proposal is to send Australian troops to,42
NA,any part of the South-west Pacific area.,42
NA,"That, of course, includes tbe north islands",42
NA,of the Philippines and areas as far away,42
NA,as the borders of China. I do not believe,42
NA,that the Australian people will ever agree,42
NA,to such a proposal. There are several,42
NA,theatres of war i n which our troops are,42
NA,"engaged to-day, but (Australia bas a special",42
NA,responsibility in relation to the Pacific,42
NA,theatre. One school of thought i n Eng-,42
NA,land-i t is the dominating school-con -,42
NA,siders that Hitler must be defeated first.,42
NA,I do not believe that any patriotic Aus-,42
NA,tralian can agree to concentrate on the,42
NA,"defeat of Hitler to tbe point, i f necessary,",42
NA,of sacrificing Australia to the Japanese,42
NA,until it could be recaptured at a later,42
NA,date. I n the early stages of this war the,42
NA,late Mr Chamberlain told the people of,42
NA,Great Britain that the defeat of Hitler,42
NA,was the first objective of tbe British Go-,42
NA,vernment. The British Prime Minister,42
NA,has resisted every attempt of the Aus-,42
NA,tralian Government to secure the return,42
NA,"to this country of Australian divisions,",42
NA,and the Opposition has assisted him.,42
Mr FADDEN ,'Tha t is not true.,42
Mr CALWELL ,I t is true. We,42
NA,have a part to play in this war.,42
NA,Some honorable gentlemen opposite who,42
NA,did not participate in tbe last war are,42
NA,doing their utmost to conscript Aus-,42
NA,"tralians for service overseas i n this war,",42
NA,knowing tbat they themselves are too old,42
NA,to fight.,42
Mr HARRISON ,Wher e is the speech,42
NA,the honorable gentleman intended to,42
NA,deliver before 7.30?,42
Mr CALWELL ,Doe s i t not sound,42
NA,as though I am delivering it? I repeat,42
NA,"that we have a part to play in this war,",42
NA,but we can never consent to the doctrine,42
NA,that Hitler must be defeated first. I t is,42
NA,more important to the Australian people,42
NA,that Japan should be defeated i n tbe,42
NA,Pacific theatre than that we should,42
NA,participate in tbe European theatre. We,42
NA,should concentrate upon the defeat of tbe,42
NA,"Japanese. Australia is a large country,",42
NA,25 times the size of Great Britain and,42
NA,"Ireland, but witb a population tbat could",42
NA,be accommodated i n London. We bave,42
NA,an enemy in tbe Pacific whose population,42
NA,"numbers 80,000,000. Is i t to be expected",42
NA,that the Australian people can fight .the,42
NA,Japanese more or less alone?,42
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,W e have,42
NA,American conscripts here to help us.,42
Mr CALWELL ,I s i t intended that,42
NA,the Australian people shall fighttbe,42
NA,Japanese witb such assistance as tbe,42
NA,United States of America can spare us,42
NA,whilst i t concentrates its major effort,42
NA,in tbe European theatre of war?,42
NA,Is i t expected tbat the Australian people,42
NA,shall agree to tbe policy of tbe con-,42
NA,scription of troops sufficient to form,42
NA,"about twelve divisions, while we have",43
NA,five or six divisions in support? I have,43
NA,to say these things in this Parliament,43
NA,in order tbat the people may know the,43
NA,facts. I have a very great regard for,43
NA,"tbe American people, as well as a blood",43
NA,"relationship with America, distant though",43
NA,"it be, of which I am extremely",43
NA,proud. I remind honorable members,43
NA,"opposite, who protest their friendship for",43
NA,"America to-day, that for about twenty",43
NA,"years they were ""squealing"" over tbe",43
NA,matter of war debts to America. They,43
NA,"were responsible, in part, for building up",43
NA,in the United States of America the isola-,43
NA,tionist bloc which kept America out of the,43
NA,war for two years. Those are facts which,43
NA,none of their new-found fervour for,43
NA,America can hide. We are entitled to ex-,43
NA,pect from an Australian Government a,43
NA,statement of what our liabilities are,43
NA,the number of men to be used outside,43
NA,the borders of Australia. We could have,43
NA,all of our divisions against. Japan,43
NA,and there would still be many more,43
NA,divisions of Japanese to attack us.,43
NA,Before we can think of taking the offen-,43
NA,"sive against Japan, we must have in this",43
NA,country as many divisions as will be,43
NA,necessary effectively to defend it. The,43
NA,number of divisions needed for its proper,43
NA,defence is 25.,43
Mr ABBOTT ,Wher e did the honor able,43
NA,"member get, that information? Is he also",43
NA,a Hannibal?,43
Mr CALWELL , I should never maku,43
NA,the mistake of considering the honor-,43
NA,able member for New England is a,43
NA,Napoleon or a Caesar.,43
Mr ABBOTT , I do not set up to,43
NA,one.,43
Mr CALWELL , I am not setting up,43
NA,as anything but an honest man facing,43
NA,a position and not running away from scription ?,43
NA,it. I point out to the House that we,43
NA,have the right to expect from the British,43
NA,"Government, too, a statement as to the",43
NA,assistance which this country will get in,43
NA,the Pacific when it mobilizes its full re-,43
NA,"sources of man-power, simultaneously",43
NA,with any movement which the British,43
NA,and American Governments contemplate ask the people.,43
NA,"making in Africa, Europe, or anywhere",43
NA,"else. To Australians, Australia is the",43
NA,most important part of the world. Any,43
NA,Australian who will not consider Ausber,43
NA,tralia in that light may be a good,43
NA,"imperialist, but certainly is not a good",43
NA,Australian. A good Australian must,43
NA,"consider the interests of his own men,",43
NA,women and children as being more im-,43
NA,portant to him than the interests of any,43
NA,other persons. I remind honorable mem-,43
NA,"bers opposite, in their enthusiasm for",43
NA,"conscription, that the fate of the",43
NA,"British people, if they were over-",43
NA,"whelmed by Germany, would be less",43
NA,dreadful than the fate of Australians i f,43
NA,they were overwhelmed by the Japanese.,43
NA,We have not failed to mobilize and train,43
NA,"our men. Comparatively, we have done",43
NA,more than any of our allies. Any,43
NA,man who said the opposite would,43
NA,not be telling the truth. The man-,43
NA,power of this country has been dragged,43
NA,from the factories and the farms. I n,43
NA,"the rural districts of Australia, only",43
NA,"as to children, old men, and women are",43
NA,"left to attempt to carry on. In the cities,",43
NA,except for those who have been able to,43
NA,"use some influence to evade service,",43
NA,there are very few young men of,43
NA,military age who are capable of,43
NA,serving. Our honorable friends opposite,43
NA,do not consider all these aspects of the,43
NA,"case. They say, as the honorable mem-",43
NA,"ber for Barker said in the beginning,",43
NA,"of the war, "" Let us send ten divisions",43
NA,"overseas "". For this country, the sending",43
NA,of ten divisions overseas wop Id be a,43
NA,physical impossibility; it could .not send,43
NA,five divisions. The voluntary system has,43
NA,"not been found wanting in this crisis,",43
NA,"any more than i t was in the last war,",43
NA,"when over 300,000 Australians went",43
NA,"overseas as volunteers, despite the",43
NA,be attempt of the right honorable member,43
NA,for North Sydney to introduce con-,43
NA,scription for such service.,43
Mr HUGHES ,Di d I introduce con-,43
Mr CALWELL ,Th e right honorable,43
NA,"gentleman tried to do so, and failed.",43
Mr HUGHES , I did not try to do so.,43
Mr CALWELL ,Th e right honorable,43
NA,"gentleman made a good attempt,",43
Mr HUGHES ,Al l that I did was to,43
NA,[Extension of time granted.],43
Mr CALWELL ,Th e honorable mem-,43
NA,for Richmond is anxious to hear what,43
NA,I .am about to say. As I remarked on a,43
NA,"previous occasion, I have no hope of con-",44
NA,vincing anybody with that bovine men-,44
NA,tality which this House has long since,44
NA,accustomed itself to associate witb mem-,44
NA,bership of the Country party.,44
NA,There was very little in regard to the,44
NA,Pacific in the statement which the Prime,44
NA,"Minister made to the House. I , for one,",44
NA,am disturbed at the failure of members,44
NA,"of the War Cabinet, the Advisory War",44
NA,"Council, and all the others who are",44
NA,"running this war, to tell us precisely",44
NA,"what our obligations are, what assistance",44
NA,"we are likely to get from our allies, and",44
NA,just what we are to do in the coming,44
NA,"months. The Prime Minister, for one,",44
NA,has told us that we must hold on for six,44
NA,"months. Therefore, there can be no neces-",44
NA,sity for conscription for many more,44
NA,months to come. He has told us tbat he,44
NA,wants to merge the two forces. At the,44
NA,federal conference of the Australian,44
NA,"Labour party in Melbourne, he said,",44
NA,""" Gentlemen, there is no argument against",44
NA,"one army "".",44
NA,"OPPOSITION MEMBERS -Hear , hear!",44
Mr CALWELL ," I disagree witb that,",44
NA,because I do not want to send ten divi-,44
NA,sions out of this country; and I certainly,44
NA,would not trust honorable members,44
NA,opposite with the arrangements in con-,44
NA,nexion with our military activities or,44
NA,with the disposal of the lives of young,44
NA,Australians. They failed ignominiously,44
NA,"in time of peace. I n the depression years,",44
NA,thev starved the kiddies of this country.,44
NA,"They had 30 per cent, of the bread-",44
NA,winners out of work and on the dole; and,44
NA,"while that was happening, those of them",44
NA,who were members of anti-Labour govern-,44
NA,ments passed bills through this Parlia-,44
NA,ment designed to make the capitalist,44
NA,"edifice more secure, by reducing the taxes",44
NA,imposed on their wealthy supporters.,44
NA,They were entirely indifferent to the suf-,44
NA,ferings of the masses of the people. But,44
NA,"now, when those half-starved and under-",44
NA,nourished kiddies reach the age of eigh-,44
NA,"teen years, these conscriptionists want",44
NA,"to take their bodies and say, "" Go",44
NA,out and fight in defence of the country,44
NA,"that starved you"". They would have",44
NA,them fight to win back for their former,44
NA,"owners the tin-mine3 in Malaya, and",44
NA,the rubber plantations which were not,44
NA,destroyed but were left intact to the,44
NA,Japanese so that they might be reclaimed,44
NA,at some future time. That is the record,44
NA,of statesmanship- I use the expression,44
NA,satirically-o f honorable members oppo-,44
NA,site. They have left behind them no,44
NA,"legislative monument, no administrative",44
NA,"act, by which they will be remembered",44
NA,by a grateful country. Posterity will,44
NA,"say of them that they were the creatures,",44
NA,"the willing tools, of the Niemeyers, the",44
NA,"Montagu Normans, and others, in thp",44
NA,mis-government of this country in a time,44
NA,of crisis. They are anxious to regain,44
NA,office. They want to destroy this Govern-,44
NA,"ment if they can; because, with, whatever",44
NA,"faults it may possess, it is infinitely pre-",44
NA,ferable to the collection of political,44
NA,failures who occupied the ministerial,44
NA,bench of this country for too long a,44
NA,period. My criticism of the present Go-,44
NA,"vernment is, that it is not proceeding",44
NA,fast and hard enough to implement the,44
NA,policy of the party for the destruction of,44
NA,the capitalist system of society and the,44
NA,giving of a fair share of the products,44
NA,of their labour to the workers of Aus-,44
NA,tralia. I have no doubt that honorable,44
NA,members opposite will try to put their,44
NA,thoughts into words a little later. I t will,44
NA,"be a difficult task. They wish, if they can,",44
NA,"to use the present situation, to destroy",44
NA,"our national unity, which can be main :",44
NA,tained only upon the basis of no con-,44
NA,scription. Any attempt to conscript Aus-,44
NA,tralians will divide the nation in two.,44
NA,"T do not don the mantle of the prophet,",44
NA,but look at the position as I saw i t in,44
NA,"the last war, and take the past as a guide",44
NA,to the future. I have not the slightest,44
NA,doubt that the introduction of conscrip-,44
NA,tion in this country will destroy our,44
NA,"war effort, and will create a schism in",44
NA,the community which could very well be,44
NA,avoided. The Prime Minister told the,44
NA,conference in Melbourne that whereas,44
NA,many thousands had volunteered for,44
NA,"the Australian Imperial Force, it was",44
NA,not desired that any more should,44
NA,volunteer because the Government wished,44
NA,not to destroy the Citizen Military Force,44
NA,divisionsbut to take the whole of these,44
NA,soldiers as conscripts and use them in,44
NA,Timor or somewhere else. The honor-,44
NA,"able member for Wentworth, of course,",44
NA,agrees with that policy. I have not,44
NA,"had the opportunity, tbe time, or even",44
NA,"the inclination, to check up entirely on",44
NA,"his political activities, but I accept the",44
NA,assurance of the Minister for Labour and,45
NA,"National Service ( Mr Ward) that, at the",45
NA,time of the existence of the New Guard,45
NA,"in New South Wales, he was friendly dis-",45
NA,"posed towards some of its members, i f",45
NA,not actually a member of the organiza-,45
NA,tion. I know why honorable members,45
NA,opposite want to introduce conscription.,45
NA,They wish to get rid of the man-power of,45
NA,this country so as to break down labour,45
NA,"conditions, introduce a larger number of",45
NA,"women into industry, and force the",45
NA,"workers, after the war, to fight their way",45
NA,up from tbe bottom of the pit once more.,45
NA,"During the last war, the right honorable",45
NA,member for North Sydney was accused,45
NA,of bringing Maltese into this country-,45
NA,"in fact, he was called "" William Maltese",45
NA,"Hughes""-t o take the place of Aus-",45
NA,tralians who were being shipped abroad.,45
Mr HUGHES ,Thre e got in.,45
Mr CALWELL , I have read in the,45
NA,Melbourne Herald of the 3rd December,45
NA,that-,45
NA,Coloured labour might even be imported,45
NA,food production.,45
NA,I t looks as i f the conscriptionists want,45
NA,"to introduce coloured labour, despite",45
NA,the White Australia policy. This con-,45
NA,scription propaganda is all a part,45
NA,"of a gigantic swindle, and I greatly",45
NA,"regret that the Prime Minister should,",45
NA,bave even toyed with the idea. The,45
NA,Leader of the Opposition proposes to,45
NA,administer conscription to tbe nation in,45
NA,one gulp; the Prime Minister would give,45
NA,it i n a series of little doses. I am as,45
NA,much opposed to conscription in little,45
NA,doses as in one big one. I see in the pro-,45
NA,posal an attempt to break down tbe con-,45
NA,ditions which the working people of,45
NA,Australia bave established for themselves,45
NA,during the war.,45
Mr FADDEN ,Doe s the honorable,45
NA,member think that the Prime Minister,45
NA,is a party to tbat?,45
Mr CALWELL , I think that the,45
NA,Prime Minister was most unfortunately,45
NA,influenced by persons associated with him,45
NA,on the War Council-person a who write,45
NA,letters of the kind which the Leader of,45
NA,the Opposition read to the House this,45
NA,afternoon. Conscription is the only issue,45
NA,upon which the Opposition can divide,45
NA,"the nation, the only issue upon which,",45
NA,"with the help of its press backers, it has",45
NA,any chance of being restored to power.,45
NA,Behind all these schemes for conscript-,45
NA,ing man-power is the idea of introducing,45
NA,coloured labour into Australia. This,45
NA,country rejected conscription during the,45
NA,"last war, and opposition to conscription",45
NA,has become a tradition in the Labour,45
NA,party. We even went so far as to include,45
NA,in the platform of the party a demand,45
NA,that the principle of opposition to con-,45
NA,scription be written into the Constitution,45
NA,"of the country, and I hope that that will",45
NA,yet be done. I f the manhood of Aus-,45
NA,tralia is to be sacrificed in military,45
NA,operations abroad as it was sacrificed,45
NA,"in Greece, in Crete and in Libya, where",45
NA,Australians bore the brunt of tbe fighting,45
NA,in this war as they did in France and,45
NA,"elsewhere during the last war, then the",45
NA,future of the white race in this country,45
NA,will be a very doubtful one indeed. We,45
NA,"have a big country to defend, and we",45
NA,must recognize the possibility tbat in,45
NA,another 25 years we may have to fight,45
NA,"in its defence again, and at a time when",45
NA,for Europe is quiet and nobody is interested,45
NA,in us. We have done as much in this war,45
NA,"as any country could do, and we have cer-",45
NA,tainly mobilized a greater percentage of,45
NA,our manhood than most other countries.,45
NA,But for the speed with which the,45
NA,"Americans came to our assistance, our",45
NA,plight would have been perilous indeed.,45
Mr HARRISON ,"Yes , they sent their",45
NA,conscripts here.,45
Mr CALWELL ,We did not ask the,45
NA,American people to conscript armies for,45
NA,"our defence, and it is only the fifth-",45
NA,column talk of members of the Opposi-,45
NA,tion which is creating misunder-,45
NA,standings between Australia and the,45
NA,United States of America by making,45
NA,comparisons between our volunteers and,45
NA,their conscripts. The newspaper articles,45
NA,referred to by the Leader of the Opposi-,45
NA,"tion which, according to him, were",45
NA,arousing distrust in the United States,45
NA,"of America, were written by Australian",45
NA,journalists. Many of them were the pro-,45
NA,duct of the chief press backer of tbe,45
NA,"Opposition, the man who is trying to",45
NA,"burst his way into this Parliament, the",45
NA,gentleman who goes by the name of Keith,45
NA,Murdoch. [Further extension of time,45
NA,granted.],45
NA,Having been favoured with a further,45
NA,"extension of time, I desire now to refer",45
NA,to the part played by some of those who,46
NA,control the finances of Australia. This,46
NA,"year, we have voted £500,000,000 for war",46
NA,"purposes, and it was done on the distinct",46
NA,understanding that the money would be,46
NA,"used for the prosecution of the war, and",46
NA,not for making profits for the share-,46
NA,holders of big companies. I t was cer-,46
NA,tainly not voted for the purpose of pro-,46
NA,viding the Broken H i l l Proprietary Com-,46
NA,pany Limited with a profit of millions,46
NA,"for the last financial year, but that was",46
NA,"what, in fact, happened.",46
Mr HARRISON ,Wha t has this got to,46
NA,do with the amendment?,46
Mr CALWELL ,Th e Broken H i l l,46
NA,Proprietary Company Limited is one of,46
NA,the organizations which support the,46
NA,"Opposition, and which pay the election",46
NA,expenses of the honorable member for,46
NA,Wentworth.,46
Mr HARRISON , I wish that were true!,46
Mr CALWELL , Similarly the,46
NA,Graziers Association pays the expenses of,46
NA,the members of the Country party. The,46
NA,gross earnings of the Broken H i ll Pro-,46
NA,prietary Company Limited for 1940 were,46
NA,"£2,600,000; for'1941, £3,500,000; and",46
NA,"for 1942, £3,100,000. And these huge",46
NA,profits have been made out of the,46
NA,sacrifices of the people. The value of,46
NA,the stores held by the Broken H i l l Pro-,46
NA,prietary Company Limited increased,46
NA,"from £1,800,000 in 1940 to £2,500,000 in",46
NA,"1941, and in 1942 they stood at",46
NA,"£3,250,000.",46
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable,46
NA,member must connect his remarks with,46
NA,the subject before the House.,46
Mr CALWELL,Th e relevancy of,46
NA,my remarks is perfectly obvious to hon-,46
NA,orable members on this side of the House.,46
NA,The Broken H i l l Proprietary Company,46
NA,Limited supports the party which is now,46
NA,pressing for conscription. The honorable,46
NA,member for Bourke bas moved an amend-,46
NA,ment asking the House to register its,46
NA,opposition to the attempt to stampede the,46
NA,country into conscription.,46
Mr HARRISON ,Ho w is the honorable,46
NA,member going to vote?,46
Mr CALWELL ,Havin g seconded,46
NA,"the amendment I propose to vote for it,",46
NA,and I expect to see honorable members,46
NA,"opposite, with their mixed ideas on con-",46
NA,"scription, bejng forced into the position",46
NA,of showing by their votes where they,46
NA,stand. They had not the courage to,46
NA,make a motion of their own when they,46
NA,"had the opportunity, and that was when",46
NA,the Leader of tbe Opposition addressed,46
NA,the House.,46
NA,"I regret that, by your meticulous re-",46
NA,"gard for the Standing Orders, exercised,",46
NA,"as it was, by your well-known sense of",46
NA,"fairness, you prevented me, Mr Speaker,",46
NA,from telling tbe story of the gentleman,46
NA,whose press activities have never re-,46
NA,dounded to the good of Australia. I,46
NA,suggest that the Minister for War,46
NA,Organization of Industry ( Mr Dedman),46
NA,and the Minister for Labour and,46
NA,"National Service ( Mr Ward), and",46
NA,those other Ministers associated witb tbe,46
NA,calling up of man-power for the service,46
NA,"of the country, should bave another look",46
NA,at the newspaper offices of Australia.,46
NA,There is no reason why the newspaper in-,46
NA,dustry should not be rationalized. I f we,46
NA,have to put up with a lot of other priva-,46
NA,"tions, then let us gladly suffer a situation",46
NA,in which there would be only one morn-,46
NA,ing paper and one evening paper in each,46
NA,capital city. I f people engaged in a,46
NA,sheltered industry are prostituting their,46
NA,talents in an attempt to force conscrip-,46
NA,tion on the country there must be surplus,46
NA,man-power in that industry. This sur-,46
NA,plus man-power in the newspaper offices,46
NA,"could be put to better use, as also could",46
NA,the. stocks of paper. They might be used,46
NA,for the printing of important documents,46
NA,for official purposes. Not only have the,46
NA,"newspapers been a protected industry,",46
NA,but they have also been a specially privi-,46
NA,leged industry. I have no doubt that the,46
NA,influence of honorable members opposite,46
NA,has been used-thoug h perhaps i t was,46
NA,not altogether needed-t o save the news-,46
NA,papers from having to play their part in,46
NA,".the war effort. There are many young,",46
NA,eligible men in the newspaper profession,46
NA,who are screaming for conscription. They,46
NA,"are like the Communists, who do not",46
NA,"want to go to the war, but want others",46
NA,to do the fighting. Let those who,46
NA,want conscription be themselves con-,46
NA,"scripted, and those who want others",46
NA,to fight do a bit of fighting them-,46
NA,selves. Let there be equality of,46
NA,sacrifice. So far as a great many people,46
NA,are concerned there is no such thing as,46
NA,equality of sacrifice. Only those who,46
NA,"are doing the actual fighting, and their",46
NA,"close relatives, are making a 100 per",47
NA,"cent, war effort. Among a great many",47
NA,others there is nothing but selfishsuffered,47
NA,"ness, greed and cupidity. Everywhere",47
NA,people are trying to make themselves rich.,47
NA,"For some this is a very good war, and",47
NA,they never want to see the end of it.,47
NA,finish almost where I began: The volunadvised,47
NA,tary system has never failed in this,47
NA,"try, and i t will not fail now. There has",47
NA,"never been any need for conscription, and",47
NA,the eonscriptionists are the worst enemies,47
NA,which Australia has at the moment.,47
Mr BARNARD ,Bass) [8.59] -,47
NA,"Apparently, honorable members opposite",47
NA,"are not disposed to speak on this subject,",47
NA,and the reason for their silence may,47
NA,well imagined. They are satisfied,47
NA,parently to rely on what the Leader,47
NA,the Opposition has said.,47
NA,I regard the statement made by the,47
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Curtin) as a most,47
NA,"excellent statement. I n the first place,",47
NA,keeps faith with Parliament by honourthe,47
NA,ing a promise which was made by the,47
NA,right honorable gentleman that Parliaformed,47
NA,ment would meet before Christmas to,47
NA,hear the. latest news of war developments.,47
NA,The Prime Minister's statement records,47
NA,"not only the deeds of valour of our troops,",47
NA,but also the casualties that have been,47
NA,inflicted upon them by our enemies.,47
NA,also gave a review of the position up,47
NA,the present. I t is cheering to have,47
NA,sented to us in a concise form a balanced,47
NA,statement indicating that the position,47
NA,materially improved. The statement was,47
NA,worth while for that alone. I am sure,47
NA,we all feel deeply for those who have,47
NA,lost their relatives in this awful conflict,47
NA,"-no t only our own people, but also our",47
NA,allies who are fighting side by side with,47
NA,"us. Our losses have been considerable,",47
NA,but. perhaps they are not so severe in,47
NA,the numbers killed and wounded as had,47
NA,been inflicted upon us after three years,47
NA,of the war of 1914-18.,47
Mr RANKIN ,The y are only a bagaa,47
NA,telle in comparison.,47
Mr BARNARD ,"Tha t may be so, which",47
NA,but tliat does not minimize tbe effect,47
NA,upon those who have lost relatives. The,47
NA,wa r to-day is very different from the,47
NA,"war. I t is mechanized, and, while it",47
NA,"more costly in materials, it appears so",47
NA,far to have been less costly in man-power.,47
NA,"Nevertheless, I am sure that our sympa-",47
NA,thies are extended to those who have,47
NA,the loss of loved ones in battle.,47
NA,The Leader of the Opposition made,47
NA,"quite a dispassionate, temperate state-",47
NA,"ment. He did not, as the press forecast he",47
NA,I would do-th e press seem to have been ill,47
NA,on this occasion-mov e an amend-,47
NA,counment to the motion that the paper be,47
NA,printed. But he did indulge in a good deal,47
NA,of criticism of the Labour party. He com-,47
NA,pared statements made from time to time,47
NA,over the last few months by responsible,47
NA,Ministers. He of course marshalled them,47
NA,"in such a way, and used only such ex-",47
NA,"tracts from speeches, as would develop a",47
NA,"case that would, in his view, damage this",47
NA,be Government in the eyes of the people,47
NA,apof Australia. He set out as far as he,47
NA,"of was able, not only to damage us now,",47
NA,but also to prepare material which will be,47
NA,useful in the impending election cam-,47
NA,paign. He criticized the Labour party,47
NA,it and its for-m of organization. He criticized,47
NA,Prime Minister for presenting to a,47
NA,Labour conference the views that he had,47
NA,in consultation with those who,47
NA,are conducting the military campaign for,47
NA,Australian and American forces in,47
NA,Australia and Australian territory. The,47
NA,Leader of the Opposition went only a,47
NA,certain distance with this. He cited,47
NA,I t certain' of the planks of the Labour,47
NA,to party's platform and its methods of,47
NA,preorganization to suit his own case. Now,47
NA,I propose to .present the full facts,47
NA,has about Labour's platform and organi-,47
NA,zation. I assume that I shall be in order,47
NA,that in setting out in more detail the aims,47
NA,and objectives of the Labour party as,47
NA,stated in the official documents of the,47
NA,party and in thereby placing on record,47
NA,all the facts of the Labour organization.,47
NA,I t is true that the Labour party has a,47
NA,"- written constitution, which lay3 down cer-",47
NA,tain broad principles upon which the,47
NA,party operates. I t is true that men before,47
NA,they can be officially endorsed as Labour,47
NA,candidates must sign a pledge. They sign,47
NA,"pledge to support the principles, plat-",47
NA,"form and policy of the Labour party,",47
NA,is available in published form not,47
NA,"only to Labour supporters, hut also to",47
NA,anybody who cares to pay the small sum,47
NA,last of 6d. to purchase a copy. Copies are,47
NA,is distributed-almos t broadcast! But what,47
NA,do we find in the parties in Opposition?,47
NA,They have no definite policy or plan.,48
NA,There is no difficulty in becoming a Candi-,48
NA,da re for either the United Australia party,48
NA,or the Country party.,48
Sir GEORGE BELL ,Ther e is difficulty,48
NA,"in being elected, though.",48
NA,Mr BAE2TABD -Tha t is true; and,48
NA,I. believe that in the future there will,48
NA,be even greater difficulty for United Aus-,48
NA,"tralia party members to be elected, simply",48
NA,because the people are becoming more,48
NA,enlightened and educated. They are be-,48
NA,ginning to realize after passing through,48
NA,"the years of the last war, the years of",48
NA,depression and the years of the war in,48
NA,which we are now engaged that all this,48
NA,talk about not being able to find money,48
NA,"for social services, improved living con-",48
NA,ditions and the distribution of goods and,48
NA,services among the people is idle and,48
NA,worthless. As the people are becoming,48
NA,"more enlightened, so also is the United",48
NA,Australia party organization itself be-,48
NA,"coming a little more democratic, if we",48
NA,can believe the reports we read in the,48
NA,press from day to day. Only this week,48
NA,I read of a plan which has been formu-,48
NA,lated in Sydney by the United Australia,48
NA,"party, but which only follows the trail",48
NA,which has been blazed by the Labour,48
NA,"party over the years. As I was saying,",48
NA,there is no difficulty in becoming a,48
NA,United Australia party candidate. I f,48
NA,two or more people want to cut the,48
NA,throats of one another in a scramble,48
NA,"to enter Parliament, the United Australia",48
NA,party finally endorses them all. That,48
NA,"happened at the last genera] elections,",48
NA,and indeed the honorable member for,48
NA,Kiehmond ( Mr Anthony) displaced a,48
NA,"member of his organization, the Country",48
NA,party. Probably both were endorsed for,48
NA,the same contest. The Labour party does,48
NA,not do things that way. I t has a definite,48
NA,plan and policy and a written constitu-,48
NA,"tion, and it endorses only its selected",48
NA,candidate. I t is on the platform and,48
NA,policy as laid down from time to time,48
NA,by the properly constituted' body repre-,48
NA,senting the Labour organizations in the,48
NA,various States that our members are,48
NA,elected. That body is elected on the,48
NA,same basis as the Australian people,48
NA,elect the Senate. There are six repre-,48
NA,sentatives from each State regardless,48
NA,of the size of the population of the,48
NA,State. The six members from each State,48
NA,gather i n conference and. discuss the,48
NA,items which have been listed for con-,48
NA,"sideration, and the majority decides what",48
NA,is to be the policy of the organization.,48
NA,Once that body makes its decision unani-,48
NA,"mously or by a majority, the decision",48
NA,is accepted by all those assembled at,48
NA,the conference and by the Labour move-,48
NA,ment as a whole. There can be nothing,48
NA,more democratic than that. There may,48
NA,be some handicaps in difficult times. We,48
NA,are living in difficult times now and it,48
NA,may not be quite so easy to follow the,48
NA,"normal procedure, but the Prime Minister,",48
NA,in his capacity as a delegate from the,48
NA,Western Australian branch of the Aus-,48
NA,"tralian Labour party, presented to the",48
NA,federal conference certain ideas based on,48
NA,his experience as the leader of the Go-,48
NA,vernment in these dark and difficult days.,48
NA,"I am reminded that this party, although",48
NA,"it has not a majority in either House, is",48
NA,in power because of the solidarity that it,48
NA,has displayed over the years and because,48
NA,of the lack of solidarity that has been,48
NA,so marked in the parties in opposition.,48
NA,We have not a majority of our own,48
NA,"members, but at least we have displayed",48
NA,solidarity. This Government has a very,48
NA,notable record in this war. I do not,48
NA,suggest for a moment that we did not,48
NA,inherit some advantages from what had,48
NA,been done by our predecessors. I t is per-,48
NA,fectly true that we did. Every Govern-,48
NA,"ment inherits good things and bad things,",48
NA,"advantages and disadvantages, from its",48
NA,predecessors. The Scullin Government,48
NA,inherited from the Bruce-Page Govern-,48
NA,ment the legacy of debt which finally,48
NA,"wrecked it, and the Lyons Government",48
NA,inherited from the Scullin Government,48
NA,the foundation upon which we rebuilt,48
NA,our solvency through the tariff having,48
NA,been placed on a much firmer basis.,48
NA,The Government that preceded the Curtin,48
NA,Government did something to lay a foun-,48
NA,"dation of a successful war effort, but",48
NA,"the latter, because of its ability to",48
NA,"make up its mind, bas been able to accel-",48
NA,erate the pace remarkably. I t has been,48
NA,able to secure the co-operation of organ-,48
NA,ized labour in its endeavours to marshal,48
NA,the man-power and woman-power of this,48
NA,"country, and also its material resources,",48
NA,so that the war effort has been prosecuted,48
NA,with zeal and vigour.,48
NA,I wish to bring to the notice of honor-,49
NA,able members some points i n the plat-,49
NA,form of the Labour party as i t was altered,49
NA,"in 1936. Our objective, "" the socialization",49
NA,"of industry, production and exchange"",",49
NA,"remains the same, but we are realists,",49
NA,"and, in 1936, we saw that only the com-",49
NA,"plete organization of our resources,",49
NA,whether i t was called socialization or,49
NA,"something else, could secure for our people",49
NA,the advantages that they desired and,49
NA,deserved. Consequently variations were,49
NA,made in the details of the platform which,49
NA,were designed to quicken our march to-,49
NA,wards national control of many of our,49
NA,institutions. We set about the work i n a,49
NA,truly democratic way. Great B ritain,49
NA,has made tremendous strides i n relation,49
NA,to social security since the outbreak of the,49
NA,war. I have read the published extracts,49
NA,from the report of Sir Willia m Bever-,49
NA,idge. Whilst I do not regard his pro-,49
NA,posals as providing a perfect scheme f o r,49
NA,social security I believe they are a step,49
NA,"in the right direction, and that they will",49
NA,go some distance i n assuring to the people,49
NA,of Great B r i t a in an improved minimum,49
NA,standard of living. As Sir W i l l i,49
NA,"Beveridge said, his scheme provides f or",49
NA,people from the cradle to the grave. I f,49
NA,we are to survive as a democratic com-,49
NA,munity we also must have a sound social,49
NA,policy. I am not concerned whether we,49
NA,"use the word "" socialization"" or some",49
NA,other word to describe the goal at which,49
NA,we are aiming. I am concerned that we,49
NA,shall have a policy to which we can devote,49
NA,ourselves with enthusiasm. I believe that,49
NA,the policy of the Labour party w i l l take,49
NA,us much farther along this road than any,49
NA,other policy. Some of the general prin -,49
NA,ciples on which our activities are based,49
NA,are stated i n our platform in the follow-,49
NA,ing words:-,49
NA,Cultivation of Australian democratic senti-,49
NA,"ment, development of an enlightened and",49
NA,self-reliant community and maintenance of,49
NA,White Australia.,49
NA,Complete Australian self-government as a,49
NA,member of the British Commonwealth of,49
NA,"Nations, the Commonwealth Parliament alone",49
NA,controlling administration with the vice-regal,49
NA,representative at all times acting on the advice,49
NA,"of Commonwealth Ministers, except where such",49
NA,appears inconsistent with Imperial Treaty,49
NA,obligations.,49
NA,The platform also provides for progres-,49
NA,sive reform in banking. We believe that,49
NA,the Government should take control of,49
NA,ilr. Barnard.,49
NA,"rhe credit resources of the nation, and",49
NA,use them in the interest of the people,49
NA,and f or the development of the nation.,49
NA,Our monetary system should be applied to,49
NA,the advantage of the nation as a whole.,49
NA,We believe i n the progressive reduction,49
NA,of working hours so that every body will,49
NA,bave an opportunity to render some useful,49
NA,"service to the community. That, I be-",49
NA,"lieve, is a democratic provision. The",49
NA,Labour party also has a definite policy,49
NA,for agricultural advancement. This is,49
NA,set out clearly andconcisely in our,49
NA,printed platform. I referred earlier to,49
NA,rhe rules of the Australian Labour party.,49
NA,"These, also, have been published for any",49
NA,one who cares to read them.,49
NA,So that i t may be clear that we are not,49
NA,"static but move with the times, I bring",49
NA,to the notice of honorable members the,49
NA,following resolutions of the Australian,49
NA,Labour party conference held in Adelaide,49
NA,"on the 18th and 19th June, 1940 :-",49
NA,Having regard to the gravity of the world,49
NA,situation and the imminent danger to the,49
NA,"Commonwealth of Australia, the Empire and",49
NA,"the allies, tliis conference of the Australian",49
NA,a m Labour party definitely declares as its policy-,49
NA,1. Complete and indissoluble unity with the,49
NA,allies in the war.,49
NA,2. The entire resources of Australia (which,49
NA,include all productive and financial organiza-,49
NA,tions) to be under the control of the Common-,49
NA,wealth Government for national service in,49
NA,the urgent and adequate defence of Australia,49
NA,and the prosecution of the war.,49
NA,3. That to secure maximum productive,49
NA,"efforts, all idle employable labour be absorbed",49
NA,into industry.,49
NA,4. Speeding up of our war and other services,49
NA,"on a planned scale, aiming at the highest effi-",49
NA,ciency and the most economic use of the,49
NA,resources at our command.,49
NA,"5. National training for defence, in terms",49
NA,of the existing Defence Act to be maintained on,49
NA,"the highest basis of efficiency, and provision",49
NA,for an adequate system of physical training,49
NA,throughout Australia. Complete participation,49
NA,in the Empire Air Force scheme. Necessary,49
NA,provision for reinforcement of the Australian,49
NA,"Imperial Force divisions, the extent of Euro-",49
NA,pean participation by volunteer army to be,49
NA,"determined by circumstances as they arise,",49
NA,having regard to the paramount necessity of,49
NA,Australia's defence.,49
NA,"6. Full recognition of trade unions, safe-",49
NA,guarding industrial standards and the partici-,49
NA,pation by Labour organizations in the success-,49
NA,ful organization of the nation.,49
NA,7. An excess war profits tax of 100 per cent.,49
NA,This conference is firmly convinced that,49
NA,Australia can be united on these principles,49
NA,and calls to Australians to stand together in,49
NA,"resisting aggression from any source, to bear",49
NA,willingly any burden that may be imposed in,49
NA,the interests of Australia's security and to,50
NA,demonstrate to the Empire and its allies that,50
NA,we shall not be found wanting in the struggle,50
NA,for human liberty.,50
NA,The conference also decided-,50
NA,In order to implement effectively the,50
NA,agreed upon by conference and to achieve and,50
NA,maintain the maximum of national unity and,50
NA,to ensure the preservation of the utmost de-,50
NA,gree of civil liberty consistent with the,50
NA,"duct of the war, this conference declares-",50
NA,(a) That Parliament should be regularly,50
NA,consulted.,50
NA,(&) That the Labour party should main-,50
NA,tain its integral identity in the,50
NA,people's interests.,50
NA,"(c) That a National War Council, in-",50
NA,"cluding representatives of Labour,",50
NA,should be established to advise,50
NA,Government in respect to the con-,50
NA,duct of the war and in preparing,50
NA,for the post-war reconstruction.,50
NA,The events of the last two years have,50
NA,caused the Prime Minister to make f u r -,50
NA,ther proposals to the governing ibody of,50
NA,the Labour party. These have been re-,50
NA,ferred to a special conference fo r con-,50
NA,sideration. Surely i t w i l l be agreed that,50
NA,it is of the essence of democracy that,50
NA,such consultations shall be had with,50
NA,bodies responsible for the election of,50
NA,honorable members to this Parliament.,50
NA,The gibe of the Leader of the Opposition,50
NA,at the Prime Minister for having con-,50
NA,sulted the representative body of the Aus-,50
NA,tralian Labour party was unworthy of,50
NA,the right honorable gentleman. I be-,50
NA,lieve that the right thing has been done.,50
NA,We shall be unable to marshal our physi-,50
NA,cal and material resources to their highest,50
NA,pitch of production unless we can retain,50
NA,the goodwill of the men and women who,50
NA,comprise our organizations. I believe,50
NA,that i t has only been because of tbe effec-,50
NA,tive co-operation of tbe working men and,50
NA,women of Australia that the manufacture,50
NA,"of munitions, the building of aerodromes",50
NA,"and runways, and the production of war",50
NA,equipment generally have been stepped up,50
NA,so remarkably i n tbe last twelve months.,50
NA,Had the Government attempted to achieve,50
NA,these essential objectives without first ob-,50
NA,taining the co-operation of the working,50
NA,men and women of the country i t would,50
NA,have failed. Because of the loyalty of,50
NA,"the working people, the Government has",50
NA,been able to make tbe utmost use of the,50
NA,labour resources of the country. I f men,50
NA,and women serving i n one locality and in,50
NA,one industry have been needed more i n,50
NA,some other industry i n another locality,50
NA,"they have been transferred, and so tin:",50
NA,war effort bas been stimulated to the sat-,50
NA,isfaction of the whole community. I n -,50
NA,stead of criticizing the Government for,50
NA,"policy what i t has done i n this respect, the",50
NA,Leader of tbe Opposition should bave,50
NA,congratulated i t . Many men and women,50
NA,"con- have readily agreed, at great personal",50
NA,"discomfort, to leave their usual places of",50
NA,"employment and even their homes,",50
NA,to go to some other locality in,50
NA,order to engage i n other work,50
NA,which was regarded as being more,50
NA,essential to the war effort. I would not,50
NA,"the bave believed, five years ago, that we could",50
NA,possibly have organized our resources so,50
NA,"completely, and I am quite sure that we",50
NA,should never have been able to do i t,50
NA,except for the sympathetic co-operation,50
NA,of tbe leaders of our industrial organiza-,50
NA,tions. We should pay tribute to the men,50
NA,and women who have responded so readily,50
NA,to the imperative demands of the nation.,50
NA,I t is only because of the democratic way,50
NA,the Government has set to work that this,50
NA,end has been achieved. I take no credit,50
NA,"whatsoever for what has been done, for",50
NA,I have had little part i n i t . The credit,50
NA,is due to the Cabinet Ministers who have,50
NA,spent themselves without restraint i n the,50
NA,"service of the country, particularly in",50
NA,organizing its resources of man-power,50
NA,and material. I have often criticized the,50
NA,Minister f o r War Organization of Indus-,50
NA,try ( Mr Dedman) because of the way he,50
NA,has done certain things. I believed that,50
NA,they could have been done more effectively,50
NA,"with less dislocation, but the honorable",50
NA,"gentleman had a tremendous job to do,",50
NA,and he bad no precedents to guide h i m .,50
NA,He had to work hurriedly and to make,50
NA,plans almost f r o m day to day. I n such,50
NA,circumstances i t was inevitable tbat mis-,50
NA,takes would be made. I have no doubt,50
NA,that had tbe honorable gentleman had,50
NA,"time to lay plans carefully, and to give",50
NA,due consideration to them he would have,50
NA,been able to achieve results witb less i n -,50
NA,convenience to the general community;,50
NA,but I pay tribute to him for the,50
NA,splendid work that he has done. He,50
NA,"deserves praise and not criticism, and we",50
NA,should be more ready to give praise and,50
NA,less ready to criticize. The honorable,50
NA,gentleman has done a very important job,50
NA,"for the whole community. He, and his",50
NA,"Cabinet colleagues, have been mainly re-",51
NA,sponsible for rhe marshalling of our man-,51
NA,power and resources for the war effort.,51
NA,It cannot be denied that there is complete,51
NA,conscription of the man-power and,51
NA,"woman-power of this country, and that",51
NA,it has the approval of the Labour organi-,51
NA,zations.,51
Dr PRICE ,"No t conscription, only",51
NA,disemployment.,51
Mr BARNARD , I should like to,51
NA,know what the honorable member for,51
NA,Boothby (Dr Price) regards as conscrip-,51
NA,tion i f it is not conscription to take a,51
NA,man from Tasmania and send him to the,51
NA,north of Queensland to work in the Civil,51
NA,Constructional Corps. I know men who,51
NA,have come from Tasmania to the main-,51
NA,"land because, having completed their",51
NA,training in munitions annexes or tech-,51
NA,"nical schools, no work was offering in",51
NA,their trades in that State. Because it,51
NA,"was necessary to the war effort, they left",51
NA,"their homes, their wives and families in",51
NA,Tasmania; and they are unable to return.,51
NA,Is not that conscription? They desire to,51
NA,be fitted into an organization in which,51
NA,they can render service at home. That,51
NA,is a natural inclination. Men who have,51
NA,been taken from one place and sent to,51
NA,another in order to protect this country,51
NA,against the aggressor have for the most,51
NA,part done willingly and without com-,51
NA,plaint what has been required of them.,51
NA,We ought to place on record our appre-,51
NA,"ciation of the services they have rendered,",51
NA,because in their way they are playing,51
NA,just as important a part in the defence,51
NA,of this country as is the man who,51
NA,shoulders a rifle and goes away to fight.,51
Mr RANKIN ,The y are in a much,51
NA,pafer job.,51
NA,M'r. BARNARD -Th e honorable,51
NA,member for Bendigo ( Mr Rankin) will-,51
NA,ingly left Australia to fight in the last,51
NA,war because he was then younger and,51
NA,physically fit. He would not criticize,51
NA,"another who, because of unfitness and",51
NA,"advancing years, remains on the home",51
NA,front. Let us not lose our sense,51
NA,of proportion 1 All cannot be soldiers,51
NA,"in the line, bur all can be workers",51
NA,in the interests of the nation to the,51
NA,degree of their mental and physical,51
NA,fitness.,51
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,I f the honor-,51
NA,able member will quote Mary and,51
NA,"Martha, he will round the story off",51
NA,properly.,51
Mr BARNARD , I would not quote,51
NA,the honorable member for Barker. His,51
NA,judgment was wrong when he howled,51
NA,"down the policy of the Labour party,",51
NA,which was designed to have the sky,51
NA,black with aeroplanes. He wanted man-,51
NA,power to be conscripted and sent over-,51
NA,seas. The present war has shown that,51
NA,an army which has not an effective air-,51
NA,screen is decimated. I have received a,51
NA,letter from an officer friend in Egyp;.,51
NA,"I n it he said, "" Thank God for the planes",51
NA,that are coming from America. I t was,51
NA,"hell before we got them."" What hap-",51
NA,"pened in the Coral .Sea, in Midway, and",51
NA,off Guadalcanal? Some of those happen-,51
NA,ings will not make pleasant reading when,51
NA,the history of them is written. [Exten-,51
NA,"sion of time granted.] A week ago, 1",51
NA,had the privilege of visiting an aircraft,51
NA,"factory, at which I saw some of the work",51
NA,that is being done by Australian men,51
NA,and women. I was very pleased to note,51
NA,the production that had resulted from,51
NA,"that organization, which was established",51
NA,in a very short space of time. Not very,51
NA,"long ago, an honorable member who sat",51
NA,"on this side, consistently in season and out",51
NA,of season advocated the building of a,51
NA,complete motor car in Australia. I re-,51
NA,called that fact during my visit to this,51
NA,"aircraft factory, when I saw the type of",51
NA,machine that is being built there. Those,51
NA,aircraft are regarded as the equal of,51
NA,anv of their type in the world. They,51
NA,are now being used everywhere for the,51
NA,defence of this country and its allies.,51
NA,"I f I were permitted, I could mention",51
NA,"what is being produced, the objective of",51
NA,"the management, the enthusiasm of all.",51
NA,and the willingness of the men and,51
NA,women employed to make sacrifices in,51
NA,order that this work may be done for,51
NA,Australia.,51
NA,I have said something about the form,51
NA,of organization that the Labour party,51
NA,has: how we operate; how we are,51
NA,"governed, always by the majority;",51
NA,and our tolerance and recognition of,51
NA,the rights of minorities. We are,51
NA,waging this war in order to ensure,51
NA,that the majority shall recognize the,51
NA,rights of the minority at all times. Our,51
NA,aim is to have a community actuated,51
NA,"by a spirit of tolerance, and a readiness",52
NA,to recognize tbe rights of all who live in it.,52
NA,The statement made by the Prime,52
NA,Minister to-day gave us a picture of the,52
NA,state of the war and the results that have,52
NA,"so far been manifested. ""We are entitled",52
NA,"to feel a certain degree of gratification,",52
NA,"but must not be unduly optimistic. There,",52
NA,"is a long way yet to go, and probably we.",52
NA,shall suffer further reverses. I want to,52
NA,see in conjunction with the prosecution,52
NA,of the war the development of the social,52
NA,"aspects of life, as is being done in Eng-",52
NA,land and New Zealand. I should like,52
NA,plans to be prepared for post-war recon-,52
NA,"struction, and during the progress of the",52
NA,war an attempt to ameliorate the lot of,52
NA,the less fortunate members of the com-,52
NA,munity. The record of the present Go-,52
NA,vernment in that regard has been marvel-,52
NA,lous; but i t has not yet done all thai,52
NA,might be done. I trust that further efforts,52
NA,will be made during the life of this Par-,52
NA,"liament, and that ere long there will be",52
NA,peace throughout the world on the basis,52
NA,"of equality, justice and fraternity.",52
Mr MAKIN ,Hindmarsh-Ministe r,52
NA,for the Navy and Minister for Muni-,52
NA,tions) [9.44] -I t is due to the House,52
NA,"that I as one of the Service Ministers,",52
NA,should supplement the speech made,52
NA,this afternoon by the Prime Minister,52
NA,( Mr Curtin) with certain comments,52
NA,relating to the service of which I am,52
NA,ministerially in control. I am sure thai,52
NA,these will prove interesting to both hon-,52
NA,orable members and the country. I,52
NA,shall also indicate the progress that has,52
NA,been made industrially in the mobiliza-,52
NA,tion of our resources for the provision of,52
NA,"equipment of war, which is so essential",52
NA,if victory is to he secured.,52
NA,"The Prime Minister, in his most com-",52
NA,"prehensive statement, gave a clear indica-",52
NA,tion of the considerable improvement that,52
NA,had occurred in connexion with world,52
NA,"strategy. I n every theatre of war, the",52
NA,United Nations are now on the offensive.,52
NA,The disappointment and difficulties which,52
NA,earlier were almost the unbroken experi-,52
NA,"ence of the Allied forces, have now given",52
NA,way to what promises to afford much,52
NA,greater satisfaction to those who are con-,52
NA,cerned with the fortunes of the war.,52
NA,The Prime Minister was good would,52
NA,enough to compliment the various British Navy.,52
NA,"fighting services, and none of them, I",52
NA,"venture to say, was more worthy of his",52
NA,praise than that which I have the honour,52
NA,"to administer, namely, tbe Royal Aus-",52
NA,tralian Navy. I t has consistently main-,52
NA,tained the lofty traditions which were,52
NA,handed on to it by the Royal Navy.,52
NA,Units of the Royal Australian Navy have,52
NA,been distributed throughout the various,52
NA,"theatres of war, and everywhere the men",52
NA,"have shown the resource, initiative,",52
NA,valour and determination which are,52
NA,characteristic of the races from which,52
NA,"they spring. I desire, as their Minister,",52
NA,to add my tribute to that of the Prime,52
NA,Minister for the work which they have,52
NA,done. I n the course of the war we have,52
NA,"suffered grievous losses, and we honour",52
NA,those who have made the supreme sacri-,52
NA,fice in their devotion to duty. Their,52
NA,heroism will be recorded in the history,52
NA,"of this struggle, and they themselves will",52
NA,always be honoured by the Australian,52
NA,nation. Tbe men of the Navy are re-,52
NA,garded by members of the other services,52
NA,witb the greatest respect. I n the battles,52
NA,of Greece and Crete our naval forces,52
NA,"were in the thickest of the fight,",52
NA,and brought what help was possible to,52
NA,those engaged in land operations. Units,52
NA,of the Royal Australian Navy were the,52
NA,"last to leave Singapore, bringing with",52
NA,them all those whom i t was possible to,52
NA,"evacuate. At Java also, our ships played",52
NA,"an important part, and were among the",52
NA,last to leave the scene of hostilities.,52
NA,"When the history of this war is written,",52
NA,Australia will have reason to be proud,52
NA,of the officers and men of the Royal,52
NA,Australian Navy. I desire to acknow-,52
NA,ledge our indebtedness to the people of,52
NA,Great Britain for their gift to us of the,52
NA,cruiser Shropshire. No gift could be,52
NA,"more appropriate at this time, or more",52
NA,expressive of the bonds which unite the,52
NA,component parts of the British Common-,52
NA,wealth of Nations. We desire at this,52
NA,time to express our appreciation of tbe,52
NA,help which Great Britain has given to,52
NA,us in this and in many other ways.,52
NA,Security reasons prevent me from dis-,52
NA,closing everything which Britain has,52
NA,done for us.,52
Mr FORDE ,Th e safe transport of our,52
NA,troops to and from the Middle East,52
NA,have been impossible but for the,52
Mr MAKIN ,Tha t is so. We have,53
NA,received generous help from Great,53
NA,"Britain, and the gift of the cruiser",53
NA,Shropshire to replace H.M.A.S. Canberra,53
NA,was an expression of the goodwill of the,53
NA,people of Britain towards Australia.,53
NA,Whilst we have suffered the loss of,53
NA,"several fine ships, I am glad to be able",53
NA,"to say that, from the shipyards of Aus-",53
NA,tralia there has come a continuous flow,53
NA,of vessels which bave done valuable work,53
NA,in keeping our coasts free from enemy,53
NA,raiders. These Australian-built ships,53
NA,"have proved most efficient, and are a",53
NA,credit to those responsible for their,53
NA,design and construction. I hope it will,53
NA,be possible to speed up production still,53
NA,more. The more vessels of this kind we,53
NA,"have in commission, the greater protec",53
NA,tion we shall be able to afford to our,53
NA,"extended Australian coastline, and. to those",53
NA,territories for tbe defence of which we,53
NA,are responsible. I am confident tbat,53
NA,Australian workmen will respond to this,53
NA,call.,53
NA,The latest addition to the personnel,53
NA,of the Royal Australian Navy is the,53
NA,"Women's Auxiliary, and I feel sure that",53
NA,those women who have identified them-,53
NA,selves with our work will do their part,53
NA,to uphold the great traditions of the,53
NA,"service. I welcome their help, which, at",53
NA,"this time, is so important to us.",53
NA,"Now, as Minister for Munitions,",53
NA,I desire to say a word on the sub-,53
NA,ject of the production of equipment,53
NA,which is necessary i f our forces are to,53
NA,succeed in this conflict. One of the great,53
NA,difficulties which beset the Allied cause,53
NA,from the beginning was their lack of,53
NA,equipment. For many years our enemies,53
NA,"had been preparing for this war,",53
NA,and they were able to time to a,53
NA,nicety the beginning of their offen-,53
NA,"sive against us. The United Kingdom,",53
NA,and the other members of the British,53
NA,"Commonwealth of Nations, had placed",53
NA,"their trust in disarmament, and were",53
NA,thus severely handicapped during the,53
NA,initial stages of our conflict with the,53
NA,Axis Powers. I t was only by great,53
NA,courage and initiative that the peoples of,53
NA,"Great Britain and the dominions, who",53
NA,were left alone in the early stages of the,53
NA,"war, were able to gather the essential",53
NA,munitions needed to hold hack the onward,53
NA,rush of the enemy while they gathered the,53
NA,greater strength that they have to-day.,53
NA,There was great sacrifice of life i n those,53
NA,days. I t was as i f human life had to take,53
NA,"tbe place of equipment. I say, therefore,",53
NA,that it is indeed marvellous that we have,53
NA,been able to emerge from those dreadful,53
NA,days when we were so ill-equipped and,53
NA,ill-prepared to meet the emergency of war.,53
NA,The response of those working in the in-,53
NA,dustries of the United Nations has been,53
NA,so marvellous that to-day we are able to,53
NA,proclaim that we have equality with,53
NA,"the enemy in respect of aircraft,",53
NA,"ships and all armaments and are able,",53
NA,"therefore, to take the offensive against",53
NA,those who have threatened our existence.,53
NA,I t is appropriate that I should indicate,53
NA,that in this country we have made marked,53
NA,progress in the provision of armaments.,53
NA,The Supreme Commander of the Allied,53
NA,"Forces in the South-west Pacific area,",53
NA,"General Douglas MACArthur, I suppose",53
NA,would be the best man to express an,53
NA,"opinion on this matter, and he has indi-",53
NA,cated his profound admiration of the,53
NA,wonderful way in which this country has,53
NA,mobilized to meet needs in the factory and,53
NA,on the field. Recently he sent a message,53
NA,to the manufacturers and workers in,53
NA,the war industries of the United States,53
NA,"of America, which I believe has equal",53
NA,application to ourselves. I t was in these,53
NA,terms-,53
NA,"From Bataan aud Corrcgidor, from our",53
NA,"soldiers and sailors in the combat zone, from",53
NA,"our Australian and Dutch allies, from the",53
NA,souls of those who have already shown us,53
NA,"how to die, anxious thoughts go to you who",53
NA,drive the wheels of war production. Without,53
NA,your help the blood at the front will avail,53
NA,"little against an enemy rich in numbers, planes,",53
NA,guns and ships.,53
NA,Industry is an indispensable factor in war.,53
NA,There can be no line of demarcation between,53
NA,the man who uses a weapon and the man who,53
NA,"makes it. If one fails, the other must perish.",53
NA,"We, your comrades of the firing line, bless you",53
NA,for what you have already done for us and,53
NA,wish you Godspeed.,53
NA,That message which he so appropriately,53
NA,addressed to the industries of the United,53
NA,States of America could rightly be ad-,53
NA,dressed to those who are engaged in indus-,53
NA,"try in this country, and who are render-",53
NA,ing magnificent service. The greatness of,53
NA,that service can be realized when i t is,53
NA,remembered that before 1937 not one gun,53
NA,"was made in this country, whereas to-day",53
NA,almost the full range of ordnance required,53
NA,"by the armed services-th e Navy, the",53
NA,Army and the Air Force-i s being manu-,54
NA,"factured in Australia, and that the quality",54
NA,is second to none in the world. Those,54
NA,guns are being used in the various theatres,54
NA,of war with wonderful results. One strik-,54
NA,ing example of the efficient workmanship,54
NA,of Australian industry is the 3.7 inch,54
NA,"anti-aircraft gun, a most effective piece",54
NA,"ordnance that, we use to defend coastal",54
NA,/ones in this country. Recently 21 Jap-,54
NA,anese aircraft passed over an area in,54
NA,which seven of these guns were located.,54
NA,"A battery of four guns, using Australian-",54
NA,"made ammunition, at the first salvo",54
NA,brought down four Japanese aircraft.,54
NA,I regard that . as outstanding evi-,54
NA,dence of the great merit of the equip-,54
NA,ment that we are supplying to our men.,54
NA,But it does more than that. The feat of,54
NA,the gunners with Australian-made wea-,54
NA,pons and ammunition will increase the,54
NA,confidence of the men using them that,54
NA,they are capable of doing the job re-,54
NA,quired of them. Our men can feel con-,54
NA,tent that they are using the best weapons,54
NA,that it is possible to provide them with.,54
NA,But it is not only in the manufacture of,54
NA,the 3.7 inch gun that we have excelled.,54
NA,Every other class of weapon which we arc,54
NA,turning out for our men in the fighting,54
NA,services is of a high order. The vast,54
NA,range of armaments manufactured in,54
NA,Australia was brought to public notice at a,54
NA,huge demonstration recently in the streets,54
NA,of Melbourne. Every one who saw that,54
NA,demonstration must have been impressed,54
NA,with the fact that the industries of this,54
NA,country have achieved wonderful things.,54
NA,On Saturday next there will be an even,54
NA,larger display in Sydney of Australian,54
NA,"ingenuity and manufacturing skill, and I",54
NA,hope that the Australian people will be,54
NA,further stimulated by evidence of the,54
NA,gigantic efforts that are being made to-,54
NA,day throughout the length and breadth,54
NA,"of Australia, to make us more secure",54
NA,against any attempt by the enemy to tres-,54
NA,"pass upon our soil. I believe,, with Gen-",54
NA,"eral MACArthur, that we shall not concede",54
NA,one single inch of this country to the,54
NA,enemy. But only by providing our,54
NA,forces witb the weapons of war they,54
NA,need shall we be able to achieve that,54
NA,resolve.,54
Mr FORDE ,Th e 25-pounder gun did,54
NA,a wonderful job in New Guinea.,54
Mr MAKIN , I am glad to have the,54
NA,commendation of the Minister for the,54
NA,Army of the 25-pounder gun. Those,54
NA,who have seen the splendid photographic,54
NA,display by the Department of Informa-,54
NA,tion of our fighting forces in service in,54
NA,New Guinea will have seen that our 25-,54
NA,of pounder gun has been used in that area,54
NA,"with great effect, I t is one of the most",54
NA,powerful weapons our men possess in,54
NA,that battle zone and I know that the,54
NA,Minister for the Army has received the,54
NA,most encouraging reports of its work.,54
NA,Not only in the production of the heavier,54
NA,artillery and anti-aircraft guns have our,54
NA,manufacturers of munitions been excel-,54
NA,ling. We have been able to provide the,54
NA,very best of sub-machine gun equipment.,54
NA,We have even been able to improve,54
NA,"upon - the latest designs from overseas,",54
NA,thereby making the weapons far more,54
NA,efficient in doing the job required of,54
NA,them. I pay tribute to the ingenuity of,54
NA,"the Australians, both the scientists in the",54
NA,laboratories and the men in the work-,54
NA,shops. They all have contributed to-,54
NA,wards reaching the high degree of,54
NA,efficiency that stands to our credit-,54
NA,in all classes of war-time produc-,54
NA,tion. A further example of the skill of,54
NA,Australian industry is the fact that we,54
NA,have been able to manufacture all the dif-,54
NA,ferent classes of armour-plate required,54
NA,and kept up the flow of the material to,54
NA,the various factories. That proves how,54
NA,valuable these industries are to Australia.,54
NA,I t is perhaps an astounding fact that we,54
NA,are able to manufacture this steel at half,54
NA,the price that we should have to pay,54
NA,if we'imported it.,54
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,Th e credit,54
NA,must go to the Broken Hill Proprietary,54
NA,Company Limited.,54
Mr MAKIN ,"An d to others, for others",54
NA,are providing munitions to the depart-,54
NA,ment. I do not desire to deprive,54
NA,anybody of due credit. All praise to the,54
NA,Broken Hill Proprietary Company,54
NA,Limited and to the others who have,54
NA,made these wonderful contributions to-,54
NA,wards our safety! One class of armour-,54
NA,plate we produce at one-sixth of what Wf,54
NA,used to pay for it when we imported it.,54
NA,These examples indicate that in Aus-,54
NA,tralia very fine work is being done. We,54
NA,have increasingly sought to make Aus-,54
NA,"tralia self-contained and self-sufficient, so",54
NA,tbat it shall be able to provide all the,55
NA,essentials of warfare.,55
Sir FREDERICK STEWART , I think the,55
NA,Minister will be fair enough to admit,55
NA,"tbat both tbe 3.7 anti-aircraft gun, and",55
NA,the 25-pounder field gun were put into,55
NA,production by the previous Government.,55
Mr MAKIN , I am not trying to,55
NA,make any political capital out of this,55
NA,matter. I deprecate attempts to place,55
NA,responsibility witb this or that govern-,55
NA,ment. A ll I say is that the guns were,55
NA,made available for the fighting services,55
NA,by this Government. This essential,55
NA,"equipment, and other war material, have",55
NA,been turned out from the workshops of,55
NA,this country in a way that reflects the,55
NA,highest credit upon our workers. Not,55
NA,"only have artillery pieces, anti-tank guns",55
NA,and anti-aircraft guns been turned out in,55
NA,"quantity but, as the Prime Minister",55
NA,"announced recently, we have been able",55
NA,"to produce 1,000,000,000 rounds of",55
NA,ammunition.,55
NA,"""What I have said shows that our",55
NA,establishments have' made remarkable-,55
NA,development. I n the past our war,55
NA,industries have been concentrated too,55
NA,"largely in our capital cities, but ever",55
NA,"since I assumed office, I have taken",55
NA,all possible steps to apply a policy ol,55
NA,decentralization in this regard. I be,55
NA,"lieved that only in this way could we use,",55
NA,"to the greatest possible degree, our re-",55
NA,sources of equipment and man-power.,55
NA,All of the twenty factories which have,55
NA,been put into production during the four-,55
NA,teen months that I have been Minister,55
NA,for Munitions have been located in,55
NA,country centres. This has made possiblp,55
NA,the best use of existing housing and trans-,55
NA,port and other essential services required,55
NA,for war production. I believe that,55
NA,through centralization in our capital,55
NA,"cities, our war industries were extremely",55
NA,"vulnerable. For that reason, and also",55
NA,because I realized the need to bring into,55
NA,production all available resources of,55
NA,"equipment, I have concentrated on estab-",55
NA,lishing our new centres of production in,55
NA,country areas.,55
NA,It ha? been a common practice,55
NA,for people to criticize and find fault,55
NA,during the years of the war. I t is,55
NA,a great pity tbat such persons could not,55
NA,accompany their criticism with a few,55
NA,constructive suggestions. My colleague,55
NA,the Minister for War Organization of,55
NA,Industry ( Mr Dedman) has been singled,55
NA,out for special criticism; but I wish to,55
NA,inform the Australian public that it is,55
NA,largely because of his untiring efforts and,55
NA,loyal devotion to the imperative needs of,55
NA,"the country, and by his endeavours to",55
NA,divert labour and equipment from the,55
NA,production of non-essential goods to the,55
NA,"production of essential needs, that our",55
NA,war effort has reached such a high degree,55
NA,of efficiency. The Minister has been able,55
NA,to secure the co-operation of the working,55
NA,"people, and so has made possible the",55
NA,utmost use of factory and man-power,55
NA,resources. Certain materials which were,55
NA,in desperately short supply have been,55
NA,diverted by him from non-essential in-,55
NA,dustries to war industries. As I have been,55
NA,in charge of munitions production I am,55
NA,able to assess the value of the work done,55
NA,"by the honorable gentleman, and I regard",55
NA,it very highly indeed. [Extension of,55
NA,lime granted.] I am afraid that the,55
NA,Minister has accepted a good deal of the,55
NA,criticism which should have been shared,55
NA,by the Production Executive. As I am,55
NA,a member of the Production Executive J,55
NA,wish to inform the House and the country,55
NA,generally that my colleagues and I on,55
NA,that executive accept our full share of,55
NA,responsibility for what has been done,55
NA,We are well aware of the fine work that,55
NA,the Minister for War Organization of,55
NA,Industry has performed in mobilizing,55
NA,production for the benefit of the fighting,55
NA,services. When the story of our achieve-,55
NA,"ments in this regard can be fully told,",55
NA,and when it is realized how effectively,55
NA,essential materials in short supply were,55
NA,"used, I am sure tbat many people will",55
NA,regret their carping criticism. I pay high,55
NA,tribute to the Minister for his service.,55
NA,I believe that those honorable members,55
NA,who are able to witness the display o,55
NA,munitions in the streets of Sydney on,55
NA,Saturday will be surprised at the diversity,55
NA,and quality of the equipment produced,55
NA,from our factories.,55
NA,I thank honorable members for their,55
NA,attention to what I have said concerning,55
NA,the activities of the Department of the,55
NA,Navy and the Department of Munitions.,55
NA,I have been proud and honoured to be,55
NA,identified with the administration of both,55
NA,"departments, and I hope that my remarks",55
NA,will give honorable members and the,55
NA,"Adjournment. | 10 DECEMBER, 1942. |",56

NA,the very great dissatisfaction that has,56

NA,"public by the banning of the ""Pleasant sun.",56
NA,"Sunday Afternoon "" broadcasts from Wes-",56
NA,"ley Church, Melbourne, by the Australian",56
NA,Broadcasting Commission. These broad-,56
NA,casts have been a feature of broadcasting,56
NA,"in Victoria, and i n other parts of",56
NA,"tralia, f o r many years and the protests",56
NA,that have been made against the banning,56
NA,of them have come not only from despoken,56
NA,nominational bodies but also from,56
NA,organizations and prominent citizens,56
NA,associated with religious institutions.,56
NA,"Wesley ""Pleasant Sunday A f t e r n o o",56
NA,broadcasts have filled a good portion,56
NA,the Sunday afternoon of many people,56
NA,"years past. I am informed that the broadover,",56
NA,casts began thirteen years ago and,56
NA,"they have increased i n popularity,",56
NA,"by year; so much so, that in many house-",56
NA,holds the middle of the Sunday afternoon,56
NA,is regularly devoted to listening to them.,56
NA,"I have some figures which, though not",56
NA,"official, accurately indicate the popularity",56
NA,of the broadcasts. I am informed that,56
NA,"in New South Wales 10 per cent, of",56
NA,listeners tune i n to the Wesley,56
NA,"""Pleasant Sunday A f t e r n o o n """,56
NA,"is a high percentage. I n Victoria,",56
NA,"however, the figure is 40 per cent.,",56
NA,"all honorable members w i l l agree, is",56
NA,pressive. These figures represent many,56
NA,Adjournment. 1731,56
NA,thousands of listeners. So f a r as I have,56
NA,been able to' learn no reason has been,56
NA,given by the Australian Broadcasting,56
NA,Commission f o r the banning of the,56
NA,broadcasts.,56
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,Th e honor-,56
NA,able member must have a good idea why,56
NA,they have been banned. Is i t not a,56
NA,further evidence of the influence of,56
NA,liquor interests?,56
Mr RYAN , I have my suspicions,56
NA,"rhar. this may be so, but the fact remains",56
NA,that the Australian Broadcasting Com-,56
NA,A; mission has given no reason for its,56
NA,actions. The final banning of the broad-,56
NA,casts came shortly after there had been a,56
NA,public controversy on the liquor subject.,56
NA,"Many people believe, rightly or wrongly,",56
NA,that liquor interests are responsible f o r,56
NA,what has been done. However that may,56
NA,"be, the Australian Broadcasting Com-",56
NA,mission's action has caused great dissatis-,56
NA,"I faction. The "" Pleasant Sunday After-",56
NA,"noon "" forum at Wesley Church has been",56
NA,used by all sorts and conditions of people,56
NA,to discuss almost every subject under the,56
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,Th e Prime,56
NA,Minister recently used tbe forum.,56
Mr RYAN , I believe that i t ha--,56
NA,been occupied recently also by politician?,56
NA,Ausof every party. I know that both t h f,56
NA,Prime Minister and the right honorable,56
NA,member for Kooyong ( Mr Menzies) have,56
NA,"at the "" Pleasant Sunday After-",56
NA,"noon "" recently. Distinguished visitors,",56
NA,"nor including Mr Noel Coward, have also",56
NA,The spoken there. The broadcasts to my know-,56
NA,"n "" ledge from listening, and from reports by",56
NA,"of my friends, have been non-political, un-",56
NA,for denominational and non-sectional. More-,56
NA,they have been of educational valnp.,56
NA,that For these reasons I cannot understand,56
NA,year why they should have been banned.,56
NA,On Sunday afternoons Dr I r v i n g,56
NA,"Benson, the minister of Wesley Church,",56
NA,has conducted a Questions and Answers,56
NA,session i n which he has dealt with,56
NA,subjects of a religious character.,56
NA,The answers are appropriate to the ques-,56
NA,"tions, and i n them can be found no sec-",56
NA,. That tional or denominational trace. W h y,56
NA,"the broadcasts should be banned, I am",56
NA,"which, completely without knowledge. I can",56
NA,i m - see no reason f o r the ban. I ask the,56
NA,Government to look very carefully into,56
NA,"the matter, and to take what steps may",56
NA,appropriately be taken to have the,57
NA,broadcasts restored to tbe programme of,57
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Commis-,57
NA,"sion, thus satisfying a large number of",57
NA,persons. A great deal of good will be,57
NA,clone to the people as a whole if they are,57
NA,allowed to have the advantage of tbe,57
NA,broadcasts.,57
NA,"I n conclusion, I shall read extracts",57
NA,from a letter I received a few days ago,57
NA,from a lady; it is typical of a large,57
NA,"number of others, and admirably ex-",57
NA,presses the thoughts of these who have,57
NA,"suffered the loss of these broadcasts, to",57
NA,which all looked forward with interest,57
NA,and anticipation-,57
NA,I am writing on behalf of the family and,57
NA,myself and friends to ask you to use your,57
NA,influence in the matter of the ban on the,57
NA,Pleasant Sunday Afternoon session from,57
NA,"Wesley Church, and the Question and Answers",57
NA,session. This act of the commission appears,57
NA,to be a direct challenge to the public. Mr.,57
NA,"Churchill once said, "" Never did so many",57
NA,"owe sp much to so few "" (correct, am I not?);",57
NA,that can be reversed-Neve r did so few deprive,57
NA,so many of so much. I t savors of Hitlerism,57
NA,and dictatorship. The Pleasant Sunday After-,57
NA,noon is regarded as a national institution and,57
NA,"should be broadcast from a national station,",57
NA,"the people's station, and the one supported",57
NA,by the people. The commission is well aware,57
NA,of the very great popularity of this session;,57
NA,throughout the years it has been the highlight,57
NA,of the Sunday afternoon session. Strange,57
NA,"that, at this late hour, the Australian Broad-",57
NA,casting Commission has banned it. No other,57
NA,"form of entertainment can take its place,",57
NA,nor is. the Australian Broadcasting Commis-,57
NA,sion equal to giving anything to approach,57
NA,the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon. I t eannot,57
NA,"be done, adequately, not even by the com-",57
NA,mission.,57
NA,Tbe ban on Questions and Answers came as,57
NA,a second bomb. A session as highly appre-,57
NA,ciated in its own sphere as the Pleasant,57
NA,"Sunday Afternoon. Again, why has it taken",57
NA,just on thirteen years for the Australian,57
NA,Broadcasting Commission to wake up to the,57
NA,"fact that it's taking a risk, that it may give",57
NA,pain or offence to important sections of the,57
NA,"community. No doubt you read "" A.B.C. bans",57
NA,"Talks by Dr Benson "" in the Argus, Saturday,",57
NA,"November 28th, and know what I'm referring",57
NA,"to. Now, who are these important sections",57
NA,"of the community? Easily answered, I think.",57
NA,"Why don't .they turn the dial of their radio,",57
NA,as we do when the Australian Broadcasting,57
NA,Commission broadcasts modern arrangements,57
NA,of the grand old masters played by swing,57
NA,bands and our lovely old songs modernized,57
NA,or sung (?) by moaning crooners.,57
NA,ghastly and the mutilation of our best music,57
NA,is absolutely disgraceful.,57
NA,No denomination is represented in Questions,57
NA,and Answers; they are absolutely unsec-,57
NA,tarian. If listeners have been satisfied all,57
NA,Mr Ryan.,57
NA,this time and wish for no other to conduct,57
NA,"the session, in fact do not want any but Dr",57
NA,"Benson, that is all sufficient, and really no",57
NA,concern of the Australian Broadcasting Com-,57
NA,mission.,57
NA,The present controversy re religion and,57
NA,eliminating some church services now being,57
NA,aired in the A.B.C. Weekly is rather disquiet-,57
NA,ing and apparently the thin end of the wedge.,57
NA,We are at war-som e of our nearest and,57
NA,"dearest are giving their all to save our land,",57
NA,"to save every one of us from the Godless,",57
NA,inhuman monsters that threaten to plunge,57
NA,"the world back to the dark ages, the days of",57
NA,"barbarism, or worse. Church services must",57
NA,not be interfered with. Are we not fighting,57
NA,for a Christian world? The radio church is,57
NA,a spiritual force in the community. It,57
NA,reaches thousands who would never hear a,57
NA,service but for it. The sick iu their own,57
NA,"homes and in hospital, the aged, shut-in",57
NA,"invalids, people of the far out-back country,",57
NA,people nearer who are unable to attend divine,57
NA,"service for various reasons, and many others.",57
NA,The best the States have to offer from,57
NA,cathedrals and all leading churches (this list,57
NA,of those who benefit applies to the Pleasant,57
NA,"Sunday Afternoon, too).",57
NA,Dr Haire and other writers to the A.B.C.,57
NA,Weekly do not appear to consider others.,57
NA,All they need do is turn the dial of their,57
NA,radio. They will find a galaxy of entertain-,57
NA,"ment to select from the commercial stations,",57
NA,even the class of music they ask the Aus-,57
NA,tralian Broadcasting Commission to broadcast,57
NA,in place of church services.,57
NA,"I hope that the Government, at a very",57
NA,"early date, will give serious consideration",57
NA,"to the restoration of these broadcasts,",57
NA,which are of immense benefit and give,57
NA,considerable enjoyment to a vast section,57
NA,of our population.,57
Mr BLACKBURN ,Bourke) [10.36].,57
NA,- I support what has been said by the,57
NA,honorable member for Flinders ( Mr.,57
NA,"Ryan) in relation to the ""Pleasant",57
NA,"Sunday Afternoon "" broadcasts. I n Mel-",57
NA,"bourne, I have expressed the opinion that",57
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Commission,57
NA,"may not be altogether to blame, because",57
NA,I have associated its action with a pro-,57
NA,vision of the Broadcasting Act that was,57
NA,passed during tbe last sessional period.,57
NA,Section 92 of that act enables the Minis-,57
NA,ter to prevent a broadcaster from repeat-,57
NA,ing anything which he considers may,57
NA,have given offence to the public or any,57
NA,section of it. I noticed that that phrase,57
NA,It's was used in the letter sent by Mr Cleary,57
NA,to Dr Benson. I believe that the,57
NA,"""Pleasant Sunday Afternoon"" broad-",57
NA,casts satisfied a widespread public de-,57
NA,"mand, not merely in Melbourne, but also",57
NA,in the country districts of Victoria and,58
NA,probably in the other States as well. I,58
NA,consider that these broadcasts should be,58
NA,"continued, and tbat their discontinuance",58
NA,was a great mistake. When the matter,58
NA,"was mentioned previously in this House,",58
NA,the Prime Minister ( Mr Curtin) said,58
NA,that he was surprised to hear that any,58
NA,religious denomination regularly had the,58
NA,exclusive use of the Australian Broad-,58
NA,casting Commission service for any given,58
NA,time. The right honorable gentleman,58
NA,was under a misapprehension. This ser-,58
NA,vice is not used for the denominational,58
NA,religious purposes of the Methodist,58
NA,"Church. The "" Pleasant Sunday After-",58
NA,"noon "" service is a meeting -at which",58
NA,addresses are given by persons of all,58
NA,denominations and all faiths on matters,58
NA,of social interest. The Prime Minister,58
NA,"has been invited to it, and the",58
NA,Minister for Social Services ( Mr,58
NA,Holloway) has spoken at it. The secre-,58
NA,tary of the Melbourne Trades Hall,58
NA,Council bas given an address on several,58
NA,occasions. I t is entirely a non-partisan,58
NA,"institution, and the discontinuance of it",58
NA,should not be permitted. I t is quite true,58
NA,that these meetings are now being broad-,58
NA,cast by a commercial station. I f they,58
NA,"offend sections of the public, they are",58
NA,much more likely to offend the advertisers,58
NA,on a commercial station than tbe con-,58
NA,stituency of a public broadcasting com-,58
NA,mission.,58
Mr HOLT ,Fawkner) [10.39] - I,58
NA,accord general support to the plea,58
NA,made by the honorable member for,58
NA,"Flinders ( Mr Ryan). Like him, I have",58
NA,had a number of protests from persons in,58
NA,"my electorate, and these have confirmed",58
NA,the conviction I previously held that,58
NA,particular Sunday afternoon broadcast,58
NA,was being made to a very wide and appre-,58
NA,ciative listening public. The service was,58
NA,not in its nature religious or denomi-,58
NA,national.,58
NA,Before proceeding with the points,58
NA,raised by the honorable member for,58
NA,"Flinders, I remind the House that we had",58
NA,"a discussion on the ""Pleasant Sunday",58
NA,"Afternoon"" service during tbe last ses-",58
NA,"sional period, when a particular talk",58
NA,proposed to be broadcast-was banned. I,58
NA,"am prepared to admit, and possibly, upon",58
NA,"reflection, those associated with the",58
NA,"""Pleasant Sunday Afternoon"" service",58
NA,"will concede, that they committed",58
NA,an error of judgment in attempt-,58
NA,ing to repeat at such sbort notice two,58
NA,talks on a highly controversial political,58
NA,"matter. Surely, there must be some sig-",58
NA,nificance in the action which followed so,58
NA,quickly on the controversy that then,58
NA,ensued. Tbe arguments have been stated,58
NA,by the chairman of the Australian Broad-,58
NA,"casting Commission. I t seems odd, to say",58
NA,"tbe least, that suddenly, after tbe discus-",58
NA,"sion had developed, first the talk itself,",58
NA,and secondly the Questions and Answers,58
NA,"or session, were banned. When the matter",58
NA,"was raised in this House, the Prime Min-",58
NA,ister expressed some surprise that one,58
NA,particular service should enjoy a mono-,58
NA,poly of a. particular radio time in a,58
NA,"national programme. Later, the right",58
NA,honorable gentleman said that he had,58
NA,"made inquiries on his own account, and",58
NA,was satisfied that the Wesley services,58
NA,could not be regarded as denominational.,58
NA,"He said, "" They have been con-,",58
NA,ducted to the satisfaction of the Aus-,58
NA,"tralian Broadcasting Commission, which",58
NA,"broadcasts them "". I t may be that there",58
NA,are satisfactory reasons why the action,58
NA,of the Australian Broadcasting Commis-,58
NA,"sion should be upheld, but I have yet",58
NA,to be convinced that those reasons exist.,58
NA,I think that the commission did not have,58
NA,"a proper estimate of the interest in, and",58
NA,"the value placed upon, these services by",58
NA,"the listening public, particularly in",58
NA,Victoria. Otherwise it would not have,58
NA,acted as i t did. The suggestion has,58
NA,been made that some of these talks might,58
NA,"continue to be broadcast,, but that the",58
NA,script should he in the hands of the com-,58
NA,mission for a period of about three weeks,58
NA,this before a talk was delivered. Members,58
NA,of the Broadcasting Committee will re-,58
NA,member tbat they commented on the fact,58
NA,that over-centralization of the work of,58
NA,the commission in Sydney had meant,58
NA,that some services could not be rendered,58
NA,in the other States. The committee's,58
NA,report stated-,58
NA,We were astonished to learn that all con-,58
NA,tentious talks and commentaries are now,58
NA,"referred to head office. This, owing to the",58
NA,"time factor, gives residents of Sydney a",58
NA,monopoly of certain broadcasting.,58
NA,I do not know what effective action,58
NA,"Parliament or the Government can take,",58
NA,but if no other course be open I think,58
NA,that it should at least be a matter for,59
NA,inquiry by the Broadcasting Committee.,59
NA,That body could inquire into the circum-,59
NA,"stances of the ban, and also into the",59
NA,value of the services rendered in the past;,59
NA,"and should it be convinced, as I and",59
NA,many members on all sides of the House,59
NA,"are convinced, that a very real and",59
NA,"valuable service was being rendered, that",59
NA,committee might make representations to,59
NA,the commission to have the service,59
NA,restored.,59
NA,"Recently, the Minister for ""War",59
NA,Organization of Industry ( Mr Dedman),59
NA,announced a policy in relation to the,59
NA,engagement of domestic servants. I am,59
NA,"told, by interjection, that that policy is",59
NA,nor to be persisted in. I f the Minister,59
NA,"would indicate that that is so, time will",59
NA,be saved.,59
Mr DEDMAN ,Tha t is so. The validity,59
NA,of the regulation has been called in,59
NA,tion and the matter is being examined.,59
Mr HOLT ,Th e Minister's interjec-,59
NA,tion indicates that the Government has,59
NA,not definitely decided to abandon the,59
NA,policy that lias been announced. I f it,59
NA,"be merely a matter, of the validity of the",59
NA,"regulation, the Minister will have time",59
NA,for a little more reflection on the wisdom,59
NA,of the policy itself. I desire to make a,59
NA,few comments which may assist him to,59
NA,reach what I regard as a sound decision,59
NA,in the matter. .Should he proceed with,59
NA,"the policy that he has announced, and",59
NA,should the legality of the regulation be,59
NA,"confirmed, the Minister will have com-",59
NA,mitted a grave administrative and psycho-,59
NA,logical blunder. As to the merits of the,59
NA,proposal as a means of helping the war,59
NA,"effort, I direct his attention to figures,",59
NA,which I understand came from the Com-,59
NA,"monwealth Statistician, showing that the",59
NA,"number of domestic servants, or persons",59
NA,"classified under that heading, declined",59
NA,"from about 120,000 in July, 1941, to",59
NA,about 90.000 in June or July of this year.,59
NA,Since those latest figures were made,59
NA,"available, several more months have",59
NA,"elapsed and, thanks to the operations of",59
NA,"the Women's Employment Board, the",59
NA,inducements for women to engage in,59
NA,other forms of industry have been made,59
NA,more attractive. I should be astonished,59
NA,"if the total of 90,000 had not been",59
NA,"reduced by at least another 20,000 since",59
NA,"July of this year. Of the remainder, a",59
NA,considerable proportion would represent,59
NA,"one domestic to the household, many",59
NA,of them being elderly persons who,59
NA,have been associated for many years,59
NA,with the family which employs them. I n,59
NA,my opinion there would be very little,59
NA,material of value to the war effort remain-,59
NA,ing in that class. Although it may be,59
NA,true that some persons in the community,59
NA,"have unnecessarily, and for their own",59
NA,"selfish ends, made use of domestic help,",59
NA,"the Minister will find, on examination,",59
NA,that a great majority of the persons en-,59
NA,gaged in this way are helping large,59
NA,"families, or invalid or elderly persons,",59
NA,who would not be able to look after them-,59
NA,selves in a satisfactory manner. I,59
NA,assure the Minister that his announce-,59
NA,ment of policy has created con-,59
NA,"s re rn a tion and dismay, not only among",59
NA,"those who employ domestic help, but also",59
NA,ques- among the people who are employed in,59
NA,this way and find their lives so violently,59
NA,shaken out of their normal routine. I,59
NA,know that that is happening to a lot of,59
NA,"people in war-time, and that it will",59
NA,"happen to a great many more, but i f the",59
NA,Minister requires more female labour for,59
NA,the war effort it is not right to select one,59
NA,particular class of females and impose,59
NA,conscription on them. By that act he,59
NA,cuts across the principle of fairness as we,59
NA,in this country understand it. Why,59
NA,should a woman whom circumstances,59
NA,have placed in domestic employment be,59
NA,put in a category of her own and sub-,59
NA,jected to a degree of conscription which,59
NA,women in other walks of life are not,59
NA,called upon to accept? The conscription,59
NA,of a particular class is a process which,59
NA,is new to this country and is certainly,59
NA,based on inequity. Before the Minister,59
NA,makes a definite decision in regard to this,59
NA,matter I ask him to answer the following,59
NA,questions: What number of persons does,59
NA,he hope to secure for war.work through,59
NA,the policy of restricting domestic service?,59
NA,What is his estimate of the average,59
NA,age of these persons ? How many inspec-,59
NA,tors does he think will be necessary to,59
NA,police the regulations which will have to,59
NA,"be issued? Obviously, unless he is to",59
NA,rely upon the law-abiding sense of the,59
NA,"community, there will have to be some",59
NA,investigation of the domestic needs of,59
NA,"the families affected, and on that assump-",59
NA,tion inspectors will be necessary. Are,59
NA,they to go into Australian homes in,60
NA,order to find out how many hours the,60
NA,housemaid or the nursegirl or other do-,60
NA,mestic help works each day? I f that is,60
NA,"the Minister's intention, the people of",60
NA,"Australia ought to be told so. Finally,",60
NA,may I suggest to the Minister that,60
NA,his itch to interfere with the lives of,60
NA,"the people has reached its zenith, or its",60
NA,nadir-dependin g upon the way we look,60
NA,at it-i n this proposal. He will commit,60
NA,a psychological blunder of the first order,60
NA,if he persists with it.,60
Mr BARNARD ,.Bass) [10.53] - I de-,60
NA,sire to associate myself with those who,60
NA,have protested against the action of the,60
NA,Australian Broadcasting Commission in,60
NA,"banning the ""Pleasant Sunday After-",60
NA,"noon"" broadcast from ""Wesley Church,",60
NA,Melbourne. I t is true that i f the script,60
NA,of the proposed talk is in the hands of the,60
NA,commission 23 days before the proposed,60
NA,"date of the broadcast, the commission may",60
NA,give permission for the broadcast to takt,60
NA,"place. Of course, that is an impossible",60
NA,condition in these days of rapid transport.,60
NA,A man who might have been in America,60
NA,"23 days before would, perhaps, be a desir-",60
NA,"able speaker, but unless he sent",60
NA,out before him it would be impossible for,60
NA,him to comply with the conditions laid,60
NA,down by the commission. Perhaps I,60
NA,"have a personal reason for protesting,",60
NA,because I happen to have been the first,60
NA,person to whom the ban was applied. I,60
NA,spoke in Wesley Church last Sunday,60
NA,week. My script was in the hands of,60
NA,the commission's representatives in Vic-,60
NA,toria about eight days before the talk,60
NA,"was given, but that did not satisfy the",60
NA,commission. I t did not matter much to,60
NA,"me, because what I had to say was broad-",60
NA,"cast from station 3DB, and I have had an",60
NA,opportunity to judge how widely these,60
NA,broadcasts are listened to by the people,60
NA,Australia. I have received many letters,60
NA,"from listeners, and others have ap-",60
NA,proached me and told me that they lis-,60
NA,tened to the broadcast. Some of the let-,60
NA,"ters were from Tasmania, which indicates",60
NA,that this is not a purely Victorian issue.,60
NA,"The "" Pleasant Sunday Afternoons"" at",60
NA,Wesley Church have become a feature,60
NA,over a long period of years. I attended,60
NA,the public meeting in Melbourne which,60
NA,was called as a protest against the action,60
NA,of the Australian Broadcasting Commis-,60
NA,sion in restricting the broadcasts. I,60
NA,"wanted to hear what was said, and to",60
NA,judge for myself how much interest was,60
NA,taken in the matter. I reached the Town,60
NA,"Hall about 7.55 p.m. and found, to my",60
NA,"amazement, that the hall was full.",60
NA,People were then being directed to the,60
NA,"choir gallery, and I obtained a place at",60
NA,"the back of the stage. Afterwards, I",60
NA,was told that hundreds were turned away.,60
NA,That meeting was organized in a period,60
NA,"of about fourteen days, and the attend-",60
NA,ance showed clearly the great public in-,60
NA,terest taken in Melbourne in the subject.,60
NA,A collection was taken up and £106 was,60
NA,"received from those present, which showed",60
NA,"that, not only were the people interested,",60
NA,but also that they were prepared to con-,60
NA,tribute to the expenses of organizing,60
NA,a protest. 1 do not subscribe to all the,60
NA,arguments used by speakers at the meet-,60
NA,"ing, but I believe that a protest was jus-",60
NA,tified. The Australian Broadcasting,60
NA,"Commission was, in my opinion, badly",60
NA,"advised. Its action was clumsy, and the",60
NA,reasons given in letters to the press over,60
NA,the signatures of Mr Cleary and Mr.,60
NA,Bearup were not convincing. One such,60
NA,his script letter was as follows:-,60
NA,The Commission has come to the conclusion,60
NA,that an arrangement such as that for the,60
NA,broadcasting of Pleasant Sunday Afternoon,60
NA,"services, involving regular programming over",60
NA,"a long period of years, is not only an abdica-",60
NA,tion from its responsibility for selecting its,60
NA,"programme material and speakers, but is also",60
NA,"calculated, as experience with you has shown,",60
NA,to set up in the mind of the person arranging,60
NA,the programme a vested interest so firmly en-,60
NA,trenched that any attempt to interfere with it,60
NA,may expose the Commission to a public charge,60
NA,of breach of faith or interference with the,60
NA,freedom of speech.,60
NA,I f that is the premise on which the com-,60
NA,"mission's argument was based, then why",60
NA,of do we have race broadcasts every after-,60
NA,noon that race meetings are held?,60
NA,The Australian Broadcasting Commission,60
NA,broadcasts football matches throughout,60
NA,the season. I have no objection to,60
NA,"the broadcasting of races, or football",60
NA,"matches, or of any other event, sporting",60
NA,"or otherwise, which is of public interest.",60
NA,A national programme must include,60
NA,"broadcasts of that kind. However, on",60
NA,"Sunday, at least, and at the particular",60
NA,"time of the day involved, I do not know",60
NA,of any subject which is of greater interest,60
NA,to listeners than this particular session.,60
NA,I should say that in popularity it ranks,61
NA,next to broadcasts of races and news. It,61
NA,is useless for the commission to say that,61
NA,it must retain control over this broad-,61
NA,cast when it knows that should it,61
NA,cease race broadcasts a public outcry,61
NA,"would result. ""Why, therefore, should not",61
NA,the commission study the desires of those,61
NA,listeners who are interested in this class,61
NA,of broadcast on Sunday? It is not a,61
NA,religious service. To some degree it may,61
NA,"have a religious flavour. In any case, if",61
NA,it be welcomed by the public it should be,61
NA,continued. This broadcast is listened to,61
NA,by people throughout Australia.,61
NA,honorable member for Fawkner ( Mr.,61
NA,Holt) has suggested that this is a matter,61
NA,which might be referred to tbe Broad-,61
NA,casting Committee for inquiry. Tbat is,61
NA,a good idea ; if the commission is not,61
NA,pared to restore the broadcast without,61
NA,such an inquiry I believe that the,61
NA,commission will see the wisdom,61
NA,and fairness of doing so.,61
NA,"ever, the Broadcasting Committee cannot",61
NA,deal with this n.atter unless it be referred,61
NA,to it by either the Minister or the com-,61
NA,mission. If the commission is not pre-,61
NA,pared to admit that it has made a mis-,61
NA,"take, and has committed a breach of faith",61
NA,"with a large section of the public, whom",61
NA,it has deprived of a service that is useful,61
NA,"and educational, some action should be",61
NA,taken by Parliament to force the com-,61
NA,mission to do justice in this matter. I,61
NA,feel very strongly on the subject. I do,61
NA,not wish to say too much about it at this,61
NA,"juncture, because I am hopeful that the",61
NA,commission will do the right thing. If it,61
NA,can be shown that great interest exists,61
NA,"in the broadcast, and that it supplies a",61
NA,"substantial public demand, the commis-",61
NA,sion should reverse its decision and re-,61
NA,store the broadcast. The commission can,61
NA,ensure that the script shall be in the hands,61
NA,of its representative within a reasonable,61
NA,time to permit of its being examined in,61
NA,order to see that it complies with the com-,61
NA,mission's requirements. I have discussed,61
NA,this subject with representatives of Wes-,61
NA,ley Church. They have assured me that,61
NA,"au arrangement has been operating, and",61
NA,"can be continued, whereby the script of",61
NA,the broadcast can be made available to a,61
NA,representative of the commission in tbat,61
NA,"way. However, the contention that tbe",61
NA,script must be in the hands' of tbe com-,61
NA,Mr Barnard.,61
NA,mission 23 days in advance of the actual,61
NA,broadcast is nonsense. I n respect of,61
NA,many broadcasts which take place very,61
NA,"frequently, it is impossible for the script",61
NA,to be made available to the commission,61
NA,even three days in advance of the actual,61
NA,broadcast. I join with other honorable,61
NA,members who have protested against the,61
NA,action of the commission. I sincerely,61
NA,trust that wisdom and common sense will,61
NA,"prevail in the matter, and that this public",61
NA,service will be restored.,61
Mr MENZIES ,Kooyong) [11.6] - I,61
NA,The associate myself very warmly witb the,61
NA,protest which has been made about this,61
NA,"matter, and I venture to hope that Minis-",61
NA,"ters, when they look at it, will come to the",61
NA,conclusion that a very great mistake bas,61
NA,pre- been made. I t is quite absurd for any,61
NA,one to suggest that the broadcasting of the,61
NA,""" Pleasant Sunday Afternoon"" session",61
NA,from Wesley Church is the broadcasting,61
NA,How- of something that is either sectarian or,61
NA,party. I t is very well known to all hon-,61
NA,orable members that people of every,61
NA,political colour have spoken there.,61
NA,"Several members of the present Cabinet,",61
NA,"as well as members of my own Cabinet,",61
NA,"including myself, have spoken at what is,",61
NA,"in reality, a very popular public forum",61
NA,on which non-political matters of im-,61
NA,portance can be discussed by public men.,61
NA,"In addition, distinguished men from other",61
NA,countries have contributed to these,61
NA,programmes. As I see the correspond-,61
NA,"ence in respect ot this matter, it is un-",61
NA,fortunate that the commission should,61
NA,have decided to impose this ban just after,61
NA,some slight controversy had occurred,61
NA,between the commission and Dr Irving,61
NA,"Benson, who presides over Wesley Church",61
NA,in Melbourne.,61
Sir FREDERICK STEWART ,I t is not,61
NA,"only unfortunate,'but also significant.",61
Mr MENZIES ,I t is unfortunate,61
NA,because it creates in the ordinary mind,61
NA,the impression that this ban arises from,61
NA,causes which find their roots in some,61
NA,resentment in the minds of the commis-,61
NA,sion. I n the course of a letter which,61
NA,the chairman of tbe commission wrote on,61
NA,"the matter, he offered as his reason for",61
NA,the ban the view that the commission,61
NA,"could not permit one denomination, or",61
NA,"one church, or one institution, to secure",61
NA,"a monopoly of the air. Tbat, I submit,",61
NA,ia a perfectly fatuous answer to the criti-,62
NA,cism of the commission. The chairman,62
NA,of the commission talks about a vested,62
NA,interest which he thought was being,62
NA,created by Dr Benson. Nothing more,62
NA,absurd could be imagined. There is no,62
NA,"vested interest in Dr Benson, and no",62
NA,"vested interest in ""Wesley Church. There",62
NA,"is only one vested interest, and that",62
NA,is in the listening public of Aus-,62
NA,tralia. I t is that vested interest to,62
NA,which the commission should direct its,62
NA,"attention. For about eight or ten years,",62
NA,many honorable members have been in-,62
NA,"vited, as I bave, once a year to be ,a",62
NA,speaker at that forum; and wherever I,62
NA,"have gone, certainly in Victoria, and to a",62
NA,"large degree i n Tasmania, I have spoken",62
NA,to a great many people who have said to,62
NA,"me, "" I have never met you before, but",62
NA,"have beard you from Wesley"". This is",62
NA,a great national broadcast in south-,62
NA,"eastern Australia, and the people who",62
NA,"listen to it, and pay their fees, have a",62
NA,vested interest in it. For that to be,62
NA,twisted round and presented as a vested,62
NA,interest represented by some gentleman,62
NA,who presides over Wesley Church is,62
NA,absurd. With great sincerity I urge,62
NA,"Ministers to look at this matter,",62
NA,because they will find a very widespread,62
NA,feeling of resentment about what is,62
NA,regarded as an entirely unnecessary and,62
NA,officious act. And I suggest tbat when,62
NA,"they bave had a look at it, they should",62
NA,use the influence they possess-an d I,62
NA,imagine i t is not small-wit h the Broad-,62
NA,casting Commission to get it back on to,62
NA,sound ground. The national stations for,62
NA,"which the people of Australia pay, and",62
NA,in which they bave a real interest,62
NA,"should not hand over this programme,",62
NA,which has been a well recognized national,62
NA,"feature for very many years, to some",62
NA,commercial station. On the face of,62
NA,it the proposal is absurd. No answer,62
NA,has been made in this case by the com-,62
NA,"mission which would satisfy a child and,",62
NA,unless the commission is able to put for-,62
NA,"ward some answer which will satisfy, not",62
NA,"only a child, but also a grown-up person,",62
NA,the Government should itself talk to the,62
NA,commission and see that the right thing,62
NA,is done.,62
NA,Mx. POLLARD (Ballarat) [11.11] -,62
NA,support the request tbat consideration be,62
NA,given to tbe restoration to tbe pro-,62
NA,grammes of tbe Australian Broadcasting,62
NA,"Commission of the "" Pleasant Sunday",62
NA,"Afternoon"" from Wesley Church,",62
NA,"Melbourne, from which I and other mem-",62
NA,bers of the community have derived a,62
NA,great deal of pleasure over tbe years.,62
NA,Since I have been a member of this,62
NA,Parliament I have not had one letter of,62
NA,objection or heard one word of objection,62
NA,to the broadcasting of this programme.,62
NA,I disagree with the right honorable mem-,62
NA,ber for Kooynong ( Mr Menzies) in one,62
NA,respect. I read with great thoroughness,62
NA,tbe letters exchanged between the chair-,62
NA,man of the Australian Broadcasting,62
NA,Commission ( Mr Cleary) and the,62
NA,Reverend Irving Benson regarding,62
NA,"this matter, and I think that on logical",62
NA,reasoning Mr Cleary won on points.,62
NA,Nevertheless I do not consider that he,62
NA,gave sufficient reason why these broad-,62
NA,casts should cease. I have listened to the,62
NA,right honorable member for Kooyong an-i,62
NA,the honorable member for Corio ( Mr.,62
NA,"Dedman) broadcasting in the ""Pleasant",62
NA,"Sunday Afternoon"" programmes, and",62
NA,I quite conceive that a bigoted member,62
NA,of either political party could legitimately,62
NA,take exception to the views expressed by,62
NA,either of those gentlemen inasmuch as the,62
NA,material each broadcast was subtle pro-,62
NA,paganda for his political and economic,62
NA,view's. I do not think that tbat can be,62
NA,disputed. But the fact remains that 1,62
NA,know of no member of either party or of,62
NA,the listening public at large having raised,62
NA,any such objection. All this trouble has,62
NA,taken place because of what I considered,62
NA,to be a most excellent address by Pro-,62
NA,"fessor Woodruff, on the liquor question.",62
NA,"I concede, however, the right of the",62
NA,people who have vested interests in the,62
NA,liquor trade to object to such a broadcast,62
NA,being made without their being afforded,62
NA,the same facility to broadcast their view.,62
NA,I t is unfortunate that the honorable,62
NA,member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick,62
NA,Stewart) should impute motives to the,62
NA,Broadcasting Commission.,62
Sir FREDERICK STEWART , I imputed,62
NA,nothing; I definitely alleged it.,62
NA,NA,62
NA,that kind prejudice the case of those tike,62
NA,I myself who realize the propriety of the,62
NA,liquor trade's objection to the Australian,62
NA,Broadcasting Commission being used to,63
NA,present only one side of tbe argument. I t,63
NA,is most unfortunate that the honorable,63
NA,member should have even imputed that,63
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Commission,63
NA,has a bias towards the liquor trade. I,63
NA,"do not know whether i t has or not, I",63
NA,"hope it bas not. Mr Cleary, Mrs.",63
NA,"Ernestine Hill and Professor Medlow,",63
NA,"who are members of the commission, are",63
NA,"admirable citizens. Is it to be said that,",63
NA,they have a leaning towards the vested,63
NA,interests of the liquor trade? I sin-,63
NA,cerely hope not. I refuse to accept the,63
NA,suggestion that they have. Another un-,63
NA,fortunate matter is that the continuation,63
NA,of those broadcasts may have been further,63
NA,prejudiced by the implication in the,63
NA,utterances of no less a person tban the ex-,63
NA,Moderator General of the Presbyterian,63
NA,"Church, Dr Button, that some one of",63
NA,high authority on the Broadcasting Com-,63
NA,mission was actuated by ulterior motives.,63
NA,"I say that with emphasis, notwith-",63
NA,standing that I am a member of,63
NA,"the Presbyterian church, perhaps not a",63
NA,very good one. That sort of thing pre-,63
NA,judices the case of decent people who want,63
NA,"to have the "" Pleasant Sunday After-",63
NA,"noon"" broadcast restored to the commis-",63
NA,"sion's programme, on its merits, but do",63
NA,not in any way impute motives. There is,63
NA,a public demand for these broadcasts,63
NA,which have made for the entertainment,63
NA,and education of the people of Australia,63
NA,for a number of years. I t should be,63
NA,possible to devise means whereby a,63
NA,repetition of the unfortunate incident,63
NA,which brought them to an end could be,63
NA,avoided.,63
Mr MARWICK ,Swan) [11.8] - I,63
NA,direct the attention of the Minister for,63
NA,Commerce ( Mr Scully) to a matter of,63
NA,major importance to Western Australia.,63
NA,I desire to know whether supplies of,63
NA,superphosphate should be carted to the,63
NA,farms while 'the wheat is being carted to,63
NA,the sidings. Under what conditions is the,63
NA,rationing of superphosphates occurring in,63
NA,Western Australia? Under what condi-,63
NA,tions will the cropping of wheat be,63
NA,allowed to continue next year? Will i t be,63
NA,on the basis of the reduction of 33^ per,63
NA,"cent, that applies this year, or will it be",63
NA,on norma] licences-o n a basis similar to,63
NA,that on which every other wheat-grower,63
NA,in Australia is operating? This matter,63
NA,needs clarifying at once because the,63
NA,wheat is being carted to the country sid-,63
NA,"ings at present and, as you know Mr.",63
NA,"Speaker, i t is of paramount importance,",63
NA,"in order to conserve petrol, rubber and",63
NA,"man-power, that superphosphate should",63
NA,be taken to the farm as back-,63
NA,loading while carting of wheat is,63
NA,in progress. The wheat-growers of,63
NA,Western Australia are in a quandary,63
NA,as to the conditions under which they will,63
NA,"be required to crop in the coming year,",63
NA,and I sincerely hope that tbe Minister for,63
NA,Commerce will take this opportunity to,63
NA,clarify their position. I f they are to be,63
NA,"subjected to a reduction of 33-J per cent,",63
NA,"next year, I remind the Minister that",63
NA,tlie Western Australian farmers suffered,63
NA,"that reduction this year, and there-",63
NA,"fore lost, the beneficial effects of",63
NA,superphosphate on their land. I do,63
NA,not desire to see tbat condition imposed,63
NA,in the coming year. I know that a cer-,63
NA,tain amount of rationing of superphos-,63
NA,"phate is taking place, but I do not know",63
NA,on what basis the allocations are,63
NA,"arrived at, and I should like the Minister",63
NA,"to clear the matter up 'this evening, if",63
NA,possible.,63
NA,Mr LA2TGTRY (Riverina) [11.21] -,63
NA,I t was reported in the press a few days,63
NA,ago that the standard of f.a.q. wheat was,63
NA,"fixed at 59 lb. to the bushel, and that",63
NA,wheat weighing 58 lb. was docked 3d. a,63
NA,bushel. That amount of dockage is out,63
NA,of all proportion to the discrepancy. 1,63
NA,do not think there should be any dockage,63
NA,"at 58 lb., or even 57 lb., because the loss",63
NA,of flour content is so slight as to be,63
NA,impossible to work out. The unfairness,63
NA,of the deduction should be brought imme-,63
NA,diately before the Wheat Board. I t,63
NA,"could be started at i d . or i d . , and be",63
NA,increased as the weight goes down to 55,63
NA,"lb. or 54 lb., which is well below stan-",63
NA,dard. Another important matter is that,63
NA,the farmer should be allowed to average,63
NA,the whole of his deliveries of wheat so,63
NA,far as the standard is concerned. I f he,63
NA,"sends in 1,000 bags, of which 500 go 62",63
NA,"or 63 lb. to the bushel, while the standard",63
NA,"is fixed at 59 lb. to the bushel, he gets",63
NA,no premium whatever on it. I f his other,63
NA,"500 bags go under 59 lb., he is docked.",63
NA,"That is unfair, because with 500 bags",63
NA,"weighing 61 lb. to the bushel, and another",63
NA,"500 bags weighing 57 lb. to the bushel,",64
NA,"the whole of his 1,000 bags averages stan-",64
NA,dard weight. The wheat is mixed up at,64
NA,"the silo or i n the mill, and if he sends",64
NA,in wheat which averages 59 lb. to the,64
NA,"bushel, he is entitled to the standard",64
NA,price for the whole of his delivery.,64
NA,Another injustice to the wheat-grower,64
NA,in every State is that he has to pay 3d.,64
NA,a ton for weighing on the weighbridge,64
NA,in addition to paying freight to the Rail-,64
NA,"way Department, and in that way is pay-",64
NA,ing for the weighbridge two or three,64
NA,times over every year. No charge is made,64
NA,"for weighing a load of wood or chaff,",64
NA,and the wheat-grower is harshly treated,64
NA,in having to pay this extra charge on,64
NA,every ton he puts over the weighbridge.,64
NA,"In my town it runs to from £1,000 to",64
NA,"£1,200 in a good year. The cost of",64
NA,weighing should be borne by the Com-,64
NA,monwealth Government which acquires,64
NA,"the wheat, or by the State Government,",64
NA,which owns the railways and receives the,64
NA,"freight, and not by the individual",64
NA,farmers. I hope the Minister will take,64
NA,"the matter up with the Wheat Board, the",64
NA,Railway Commissioners or the State,64
NA,"Ministers for Agriculture, and do his",64
NA,best to have the charge for weighing,64
NA,wheat abolished. The three matters that,64
NA,I have mentioned should be at once,64
NA,"attended to, and relief given to the",64
NA,"farmer, who, in existing circumstances, is",64
NA,carrying the baby all the time.,64
Mr HUTCHINSON ,Deakin) [11.25].,64
NA,- I support the honorable member,64
NA,Flinders ( Mr Ryan) and others who,64
NA,have appealed for the reconsideration,64
NA,"rhe ban on the Wesley "" Pleasant Sunday",64
NA,"Afternoon "" broadcasts. They have been",64
NA,the means for many years of allowing,64
NA,public to hear interesting speakers on,64
NA,"sorts of subjects, and i t is safe to say",64
NA,many of the finest speeches made i n Austhat,64
NA,tralia have gone over to listeners from,64
NA,Wesley Church on Sunday afternoons.,64
NA,I do not believe that any particular,64
NA,denomination should have a complete,64
NA,"monopoly of broadcasts of this kind,",64
NA,"I am sure that no one would claim it,",64
NA,"because, obviously, any organization",64
NA,or section which had a monopoly,64
NA,of the air every Sunday would obtain,64
NA,certain definite advantages. I f requests,64
NA,have been made for broadcasts of equal,64
NA,importance on Sunday afternoons by,64
NA,"other churches, they have every right to",64
NA,be considered by the commission. Tbe,64
NA,popularity of the Wesley Church broad-,64
NA,casts shows that there is room every,64
NA,week for a pleasant Sunday afternoon,64
NA,broadcast of tbat kind. Whilst I would,64
NA,deny to any one church a monopoly of,64
NA,"this service, I have not heard of any",64
NA,request having been made by any other,64
NA,denomination to broadcast addresses of,64
NA,the kind that have come from Wesley,64
NA,Church. I have not heard in the course,64
NA,"of years a complaint from any person, no",64
NA,matter what his politics or denomina-,64
NA,"tion, about the broadcasting, Sunday after",64
NA,"Sunday, of the Wesley Church service.",64
NA,The Australian Broadcasting Commission,64
NA,must definitely safeguard the Australian,64
NA,"people from any organization, sect or sec-",64
NA,tion which would seek at any time,64
NA,to use the national stations for any,64
NA,form of propaganda aimed at advancing,64
NA,its own ends. I have not sufficient evi-,64
NA,dence before me to form an opinion,64
NA,regarding the charge that that was,64
NA,attempted by Wesley Church. I have,64
NA,looked at the address which was the,64
NA,"cause of all the trouble, but I am not",64
NA,aware of what took place previously.,64
NA,"I am, therefore, not going to voice an",64
NA,opinion on something about which I know,64
NA,nothing. Even i f it were thought that,64
NA,similar views on the one subject were,64
NA,being broadcast too often from any par-,64
NA,"ticular forum, surely it was a matter for",64
NA,negotiation in a gentlemanly way between,64
NA,for the commission and the church or,64
NA,organization concerned. Certainly there,64
NA,of was no need for so drastic a step as the,64
NA,banning of these broadcasts. The con-,64
NA,ditions imposed to-day are so onerous as,64
NA,the to be tantamount to a complete banning,64
NA,all of the broadcasting of Wesley Church,64
NA,"that "" Pleasant Sunday Afternoons "". I hope",64
NA,further consideration will be given,64
NA,"to the matter, and that before long we",64
NA,shall once again hear coming over the,64
NA,"ether on Sunday afternoons, the enter-",64
NA,taining and very enlightening speeches to,64
NA,and which we have been accustomed.,64
NA,I wish to bring to the attention of the,64
NA,Government a matter affecting the,64
NA,Department of the Interior. Land ac-,64
NA,quired for military or other purposes by,64
NA,the Government is eventually settled for,64
NA,by that department. I receive repeated,64
NA,complaints about tbe slowness of the,65
NA,department in settling for lands so,65
NA,acquired. I am told that often delays,65
NA,occur owing to disputes between the,65
NA,"Government and tbe parties concerned,",65
NA,"but in other cases, where there is no",65
NA,dispute whatever and the valuation of tbe,65
NA,land is accepted by the individual,65
NA,"interested, payment for the land is de-",65
NA,ferred for months. I n many instances,65
NA,the person whose property has been,65
NA,acquired has been forced to wait-,65
NA,months for a settlement and bas,65
NA,been compensated by a payment at tbe,65
NA,"rate of only 3 per cent, per annum on the",65
NA,amount outstanding. This causes grave,65
NA,injustices. Properties are often mort-,65
NA,gaged and the mortgagee has to pay 5 per,65
NA,"cent, or 5$ per cent, on his overdraft.",65
NA,"Obviously if he receives only 3 per cent,",65
NA,from the Government he is placed in a,65
NA,most unfair position. I therefore ask that,65
NA,steps be taken to ensure prompt settle-,65
NA,ments and the payment of a more equit-,65
NA,able interest rate on outstanding amounts,65
NA,pending settlements.,65
Mr COLES ,Henty) [11.32] - I asso-,65
NA,ciate myself strongly with the protest,65
NA,made by the honorable member for,65
NA,Flinders ( Mr Ryan) against the ban-,65
NA,ning by the Australian Broadcasting,65
NA,"Commission of the "" Pleasant Sunday",65
NA,"Afternoon"" broadcasts from ""Wesley",65
NA,"Church, Melbourne. I know of nothing",65
NA,that has happened recently in broad-,65
NA,casting that has caused such widespread,65
NA,dissatisfaction among listeners. I have,65
NA,"frequently listened to the ""Pleasant",65
NA,"Sunday Afternoon"" broadcasts.",65
NA,have found them to be undenomina-,65
NA,tional and unsectarian. Subjects of,65
NA,all descriptions have been discussed by the,65
NA,"various speakers and, in general, the",65
NA,broadcasts have created great interest,65
NA,over a long period-. of years. Many,65
NA,thousands of people throughout Australia,65
NA,have devoted their Sunday afternoons to,65
NA,listening to these broadcasts and they,65
NA,strongly resent what they regard as the,65
NA,unjustified discontinuance of them. The,65
NA,decision to ban tbe broadcasts appears,65
NA,to me to be thoroughly bad. I t seems,65
NA,"that an official, or several officials, have",65
NA,attempted to. bolster up their authority,65
NA,and to exercise their prerogative to,65
NA,decide whatshall and what shall,65
NA,not be put on the air. I do not know,65
NA,what influence the Government can exert,65
NA,"in the matter, but I hope that the fullest",65
NA,inquiry will be made to ascertain why,65
NA,the broadcasts have been discontinued and,65
NA,to ensure that they are restored as soon,65
NA,as possible. The broadcasts were of a,65
NA,high educational and entertainment,65
NA,value. Invariably the speakers put their,65
NA,case with cogency and effect. The fact,65
NA,"that the "" Pleasant Sunday Afternoon """,65
NA,entertainment is now being broadcast,65
NA,every Sunday afternoon by station 3DB,65
NA,fortifies my view that the Aus-,65
NA,tralian Broadcasting Commission made,65
NA,a thoroughly bad decision in ban-,65
NA,ning it. I t is unlikely that a com-,65
NA,mercial station would broadcast the ses-,65
NA,sion i f it were not of a high value. Surely,65
NA,the people who pay their licence-fees to,65
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Commis-,65
NA,sion are entitled to some consideration.,65
NA,I hope that the Government will review,65
NA,the whole matter and take steps to ensure,65
NA,that listeners are provided with the,65
NA,programmes which they desire.,65
NA,I bring to the notice of the Minister of,65
NA,Commerce ( Mr Scully) certain factors,65
NA,associated with the discontinuance of the,65
NA,apple and pear acquisition scheme in Vic-,65
NA,toria to which immediate attention should,65
NA,be given. There are some loose threads,65
NA,that need to be tied. The acquisition,65
NA,scheme has been in operation for about,65
NA,"three years, during which period the",65
NA,orchardists have lost contact with the,65
NA,marketing facilities they formerly used.,65
NA,I understand that instructions have been,65
NA,given to the board that growers of apples,65
NA,I and pears in Victoria shall be provided,65
NA,with cases for the marketing of this year's,65
NA,crop. I f cases are not made available in,65
NA,this way the orchardists will .be placed in,65
NA,"a very difficult position. I hope, too, that",65
NA,the Minister will give instructions that,65
NA,"transport facilities, with appropriate",65
NA,"priorities, shall be provided. This is an",65
NA,urgent matter for the fruit will be coming,65
NA,"on the market almost at once. I ask,",65
NA,"therefore, that immediate attention be",65
NA,given to it.,65
NA,NA,65
NA,support the protest of the honorable mem-,65
NA,ber for Flinders ( Mr Ryan) against the,65
NA,"banning of the "" Pleasant Sunday After-",65
NA,"noon "" broadcasts from Wesley Church,",65
NA,Melbourne. I do not think it can be said,65
NA,that the morals of any citizen in Aus-,66
NA,tralia have been prejudicially affected by,66
NA,these broadcasts. No complaints have,66
NA,been made against them. Some objection,66
NA,may have been taken to recent broadcasts,66
NA,"on the liquor question, but these do not",66
NA,justify the banning of the broadcasts.,66
NA,The forum provided at Wesley Church,66
NA,on Sunday afternoons has been used by,66
NA,many distinguished visitors to Australia.,66
NA,The broadcasts are enjoyed by listeners,66
NA,all over the continent. I n Western Aus-,66
NA,tralia we frequently listen to them. I,66
NA,regard it as effrontery by the officials of,66
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Commission,66
NA,to have banned this broadcast.,66
NA,I call the attention of the Minister for,66
NA,Commerce ( Mr Scully) to certain un-,66
NA,satisfactory features associated with the,66
NA,shortage of potatoes in Australia and the,66
NA,steps taken to increase the supply. The,66
NA,Government bas urged growers to do,66
NA,their best to increase their production so,66
NA,that ample supplies may be available for,66
NA,both the armed forces and the civil popu-,66
NA,lation. Potato-growers from Western,66
NA,Australia were assured that contracts,66
NA,"would be arranged, but when they tried",66
NA,to buy potato fertilizer they found i t was,66
NA,in short supply. This also has caused,66
NA,difficulty. The potato-growers of Western,66
NA,Australia were assured that they would,66
NA,receive a minimum of £8 10s. a ton for,66
NA,grade potatoes at railway sidings.,66
NA,I t has now been rumoured that the con-,66
NA,"trol of the potato industry is to cease, as",66
NA,the Government now finds the supply,66
NA,"ample, and that only those who signed",66
NA,contracts with the Government are to be,66
NA,treated with. Growers in Western Aus-,66
NA,tralia without contracts are apparently,66
NA,"to be thrown to the wolves, although until",66
NA,"now they could not dispose of a potato,",66
NA,or even give one to their own people.,66
NA,They have been required to provide new,66
NA,"bags for potatoes that are to be sold, and",66
NA,they have had to pay a high price for the,66
NA,necessary fertilizers. I have received,66
NA,from tbe Minister an intimation that the,66
NA,Potato Control Board will not cease,66
NA,"operations, but that those who have not",66
NA,signed contracts will now be entitled to,66
NA,sell potatoes as they please or give,66
NA,them to their friends i f they desire,66
NA,to do so. The Government under-,66
NA,takes that i t will not use any surplus to,66
NA,[62],66
NA,flush the market and reduce the price,66
NA,below that which the Western Australian,66
NA,growers were assured they would receive.,66
NA,I hope that the Minister will remove the,66
NA,impression that has been gained because,66
NA,many growers who have not entered into,66
NA,contracts were urged by officials in,66
NA,Western Australia that they would,66
NA,certainly receive a minimum price of,66
NA,"£8 10s, a ton i f they complied with all",66
NA,of the regulations of the board. The,66
NA,"""board should therefore see that those",66
NA,growers who patriotically stepped into,66
NA,line in an effort to overcome the shortage,66
NA,of potatoes in Western Australia do not,66
NA,suffer by reason of their action.,66
Mr WILSON ,Wimmera) [11.43] - I,66
NA,draw the attention of the Minister for,66
NA,the Army ( Mr Forde) to the efforts,66
NA,"being made, witb little success, from time",66
NA,to time by persons who have ideas or,66
NA,patents which they think would in some,66
NA,way assist in the war effort. The Army,66
NA,Inventions Directorate seems to have a,66
NA,capacity for rejecting all ideas placed,66
NA,before it. I have noticed recently in the,66
NA,"press that, in Germany, the pro-",66
NA,duction is contemplated of a machine,66
NA,"known as the ""scythe of death""-tha t",66
NA,is a variation of the machine-gun prin-,66
NA,ciple employed in the form of an auto-,66
NA,matic traverse which traverses the fire,66
NA,of the gun horizontally and in various,66
NA,"other ways, which would greatly improve",66
NA,the effectiveness of any machine gun or,66
NA,"cannon. Becently, to my knowledge, an",66
NA,Australian who is a returned soldier,66
NA,"from the last war, attempted to have",66
NA,this principle accepted by the Army I n -,66
NA,ventions Directorate. He was actuated,66
NA,only by a desire to give something to his,66
NA,country that would be effective in the,66
NA,prosecution of this war and in the defeat,66
NA,"of the enemy; but like hundreds of others,",66
NA,"he received a cold shoulder, and nothing",66
NA,was heard of his proposal. When a,66
NA,patent or a proposition is placed before,66
NA,the directorate the person who gives,66
NA,it is told that something will be done,66
NA,"with it, and that he will be informed",66
NA,later whether it has been accepted. I f,66
NA,any information is asked for as to,66
NA,whether the invention is believed to have,66
NA,"defects, no information is given as to",66
NA,"what those defects may be, on the ground",66
NA,that that course is necessary for security,66
NA,reasons. We are slipping considerably in,66
NA,this matter. Any invention that has any,67
NA,possibility of success should be given a,67
NA,"trial, and we should place at the disposal",67
NA,of those who are industrious enough to,67
NA,spend time and money in preparing,67
NA,models an opportunity to try them,67
NA,cut in a workshop. I f we got even,67
NA,"5 per cent, of successes, this course",67
NA,would be worth while. I impress,67
NA,on the Minister the necessity for giving,67
NA,some direction to this department to see,67
NA,that a careful scrutiny is given of all pro-',67
NA,"posals submitted, and that some oppor-",67
NA,tunity is afforded to test inventions. I,67
NA,know that there is a bias against new,67
NA,ideas because they may interfere with the,67
NA,production of particular lines already,67
NA,"being made, but we must explore every",67
NA,"avenue"" i f we are to win the war as",67
NA,quickly as possible.,67
NA,I add my endorsement to what has been,67
NA,said to-night regarding the broadcasting,67
NA,of pleasant Sunday afternoon addresses,67
NA,"at Wesley Church, Melbourne. I t",67
NA,"is a popular session, and nobody",67
NA,is convinced ithat the reasons ad-,67
NA,vanced by the Australian Broadcasting,67
NA,Commission for the prohibition of these,67
NA,broadcasts are sound from a public point,67
NA,of view. I hope that some action will,67
NA,be taken quickly to restore these popular,67
NA,broadcasts.,67
Mr CALWELL ,Melbourne) [11.48].,67
NA,- A big public meeting was held in the,67
NA,"Melbourne Town Hall, presided over",67
NA,"by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, to",67
NA,protest against the action of the Aus-,67
NA,tralian Broadcasting Commission in can-,67
NA,celling the Sunday afternoon broadcasts,67
NA,"of addresses from - Wesley Church,",67
NA,Melbourne. Yesterday I introduced,67
NA,a deputation consisting of two Mel-,67
NA,bourne clergymen to the Postmaster-,67
NA,General (Senator Ashley) on this,67
NA,"subject, and he is looking into the",67
NA,matter. The action of tbe commission in,67
NA,requiring 23 days' notice of the script to,67
NA,be read is unreasonable. Nobody as a,67
NA,regular routine could supply script at,67
NA,"such long notice, particularly as many of",67
NA,the speakers are well-known public men,67
NA,who i n ordinary times would not be,67
NA,required to submit script at all. They,67
NA,are asked to submit it only because,67
NA,of tbe possibility that some of tbe matters,67
NA,"mentioned in their addresses might, for",67
NA,"military or other reasons, be considered",67
NA,by the censorship authorities to be un-,67
NA,desirable. I believe that tbe matter is,67
NA,"being reconsidered by the commission,",67
NA,and I hope that it will be favorably,67
NA,reconsidered. The commission has not,67
NA,said that these broadcasts are to be en-,67
NA,"tirely prohibited, but i t bas laid down",67
NA,conditions which are onerous and in-,67
NA,capable of fulfilment. There is in Mel-,67
NA,bourne a very big body of public opinion,67
NA,which favours the continuation of the,67
NA,broadcasts. Many honorable members,67
NA,have spoken from the platform of Wesley,67
NA,"Church, and bave been listened to by a",67
NA,large audience in Melbourne and its,67
NA,environs. The commission is an inde-,67
NA,"pendent body, and its independence was",67
NA,confirmed in the amending and consoli-,67
NA,dating legislation passed by this Parlia-,67
NA,ment early this year. The Minister has,67
NA,no power to direct the commission in,67
NA,"relation to its policy. Parliament, in its",67
NA,"wisdom, considers that tbe commission",67
NA,should not be under parliamentary con-,67
NA,trol. The arguments in favour of its,67
NA,independence need not be recapitulated,67
NA,at this stage. Suffice it to say tbat in,67
NA,European countries in which Ministers,67
NA,"control broadcasting instrumentalities,",67
NA,the party of the day has exclusive rights.,67
NA,There are ways in which Minis-,67
NA,ters can discuss with the commis-,67
NA,sion tbe advisability of the restoration of,67
NA,this programme. I hope that the com-,67
NA,mission will see the wisdom of recogniz-,67
NA,ing the strength of the case tbat bas been,67
NA,"made out in this House to-night, and tbe",67
NA,volume of public feeling outside the Par-,67
NA,liament.,67
NA,The other matter to which I wish to,67
NA,refer concerns the censorship. I want to,67
NA,mention several facts concerning recent,67
NA,"articles written by Sir Keith Murdoch,",67
NA,who is required by a censorship order of,67
NA,the Victorian publicity censor under regu-,67
NA,"lation 16, sub-regulation 2B, issued under",67
NA,"the National Security Act, to submit all",67
NA,his signed matter intended for publication,67
NA,in the Melbourne Herald. The censor who,67
NA,issued the instruction was Mr C. Burns.,67
NA,The submittal order was issued over two,67
NA,"months ago. He bas failed, or refused, to",67
NA,comply with the press censorsbip,67
NA,authority by-,67
NA,(a) Publishing on the 6th October a,67
NA,"signed article beaded "" One",67
NA,Cause: One Army-Ne w,67
NA,Guinea Provides a Stern Argu-,68
NA,"ment"". This article was sub-",68
NA,mitted only in part to the Vic-,68
NA,torian publicity censor.,68
NA,part not submitted included,68
NA,references to the Minister for,68
NA,the Army ( Mr Forde) and the,68
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Curtin) ;,68
NA,"(b) Publishing on the 10th October,",68
NA,without having submitted it to,68
NA,"censorship, a signed article",68
NA,"headed: ""Fight for the Bestr-",68
NA,Our Army is Our Supreme,68
NA,"National E f f o r t "";",68
NA,"(c) Publishing on the 16th October,",68
NA,"again without submission, a",68
NA,"signed article headed: "" Tell All",68
NA,the News-th e Newspapers Do,68
NA,"Their Duty "".",68
NA,I do not agree with that. I point out,68
NA,that even when a newspaper publisher or,68
NA,editor is not required by a specific order,68
NA,"to submit material he must, under",68
NA,"National Security Regulation 16, submit",68
NA,all doubtful matter. Sir Keith Murdoch's,68
NA,"articles were certainly of this character,",68
NA,and contained many poisonous sentiments,68
NA,"and censorship breaches. Recently, as",68
NA,"honorable members may recollect, there",68
NA,was a reshuffle in the Victorian publicity,68
NA,"censorship, when Mr Burns retired.",68
Mr MARWICK ,Ho w does the honor-,68
NA,able member know that the articles were,68
NA,not submitted in full?,68
Mr CALWELL ,Fro m information,68
NA,received-whic h in the police courts is,68
NA,accepted as evidence.,68
Mr MARWICK ,Ca n the facts,68
NA,ascertained from the censor himself?,68
Mr CALWELL ,M y authority is un-,68
NA,impeachable. I have not the slightest,68
NA,doubt that the censor will be able to,68
NA,"verify the facts, i f the Minister refers",68
NA,the matter to him. A former employee,68
NA,of the Melbourne Herald who had been,68
NA,a member of its staff for a period of,68
NA,"eight and a half years, received the resul-",68
NA,tant appointment of Victorian publicity,68
NA,censor. His former employer is now,68
NA,"treating him, in his new position, witb",68
NA,contempt. I object to tbat. Honorable,68
NA,members will recall that when Sir Keith,68
NA,Murdoch's articles were discussed in this,68
NA,"House some months ago, tbe Minister for",68
NA,"the Army, in reply to a question, said",68
NA,tbat they were signed and passed by the,68
NA,censor. I assure the honorable gentleman,68
NA,that that is not so. I bave the articles,68
NA,"about which I complain, and the state-",68
NA,ments tbat I make can be checked. I n,68
NA,"The view of what I bave said, this gentleman",68
NA,needs a good deal of watching by tbe,68
NA,censorship authorities. I am certain tbat,68
NA,"the article published last night, about",68
NA,"which I have complained, would not",68
NA,have been passed by any censor had i t,68
NA,been submitted to him. I t was not merely,68
NA,an expression of opinion; it was a deli-,68
NA,berate attempt to stir up strife in this,68
NA,"country, to weaken the morale of the",68
NA,nation by dividing it. I t was a,68
NA,gratuitous insult to people of cer-,68
NA,tain blood who have played a,68
NA,"distinguished part, in common with their",68
NA,"fellow citizens, first in laying the foun-",68
NA,"dations of thi3 country's greatness, and,",68
NA,"secondly, in helping to build i t to its",68
NA,present strength. I regard Murdoch as a,68
NA,"very dangerous man at large, and hope",68
NA,that the censor does not permit defiance,68
NA,by him. I trust that the Government will,68
NA,"watch him very carefully; because, i f be",68
NA,"is allowed to defy censorship instructions,",68
NA,there is no telling what great harm he,68
NA,may do. He wants to enter this Parlia-,68
NA,ment in order to dominate it. He is,68
NA,anxious to oppose the right honorable,68
NA,member for Kooyong ( Mr Menzies). He,68
NA,has cast covetous eyes upon the United,68
NA,Australia party blue ribbon seat of,68
NA,Fawkner; and he has ambitions i n regard,68
NA,to supplanting the honorable member for,68
NA,Henty ( Mr Coles). The best place for,68
NA,him is outside the councils of this nation.,68
NA,I have noticed that he desires to treble,68
NA,"be the membership of this Parliament,",68
NA,obviously for the purpose of trebling his,68
NA,chance of entering it. The Minister for,68
NA,the Army will be failing i n bjs duty i f he,68
NA,does not do something very definite about,68
NA,the articles which Murdoch i3 publish-,68
NA,"ing in the press of Australia,",68
NA,throughout its many ramifications. But,68
NA,"what is worse, he is cabling these poison-",68
NA,ous articles to America and England,68
NA,without the censorship authorities having,68
NA,seen them. He is trying to cause trouble,68
NA,"for the Government of this country, and",68
NA,"the nation, by telling the people of",68
NA,America things tbat ought not to be,68
NA,allowed to pass out of Australia. I have,68
NA,described him to-night as a fifth,68
NA,columnist. I consider tbat he is a megalo-,68
NA,"maniac, who cannot help himself. His",68
NA,"desire is for notoriety and domination,",69
NA,and he has to be restrained. I f present,69
NA,"Ministers cannot restrain him, they ought",69
NA,to make way for others who will. I f he,69
NA,"be not restrained, I bave not the slightest",69
NA,doubt that he will do all he can to,69
NA,bring our democratic institutions into,69
NA,disrepute.,69
NA,NA,69
NA,member know what Sir Keith Murdoch,69
NA,thinks of him ?,69
Mr CALWELL ,Eve n if he thinks as,69
NA,"badly of me as I do of him, I am con--",69
NA,fident tbat public opinion throughout this,69
NA,country is much more likely to support,69
NA,me than -they are likely to support him.,69
NA,Any honorable member whom he may be,69
NA,oppose for election to this Parliament,69
NA,"will be lucky in his opposition, because",69
NA,it will be one of the easiest victories he,69
NA,is every likely to win. I f he wishes to,69
NA,dispute my membership of this Parlia-,69
NA,ment for the blue ribbon seat of Mel-,69
NA,"bourne, I believe that, by the grace of",69
NA,-God and the sturdy common sense of at,69
NA,"least 51 per cent, of the electors, I shall",69
NA,still be a member of this Parliament for,69
NA,many years to come.,69
NA,"Friday, 11 December, 194£.",69
Mr CONELAN ,Griffith) [12 mid-,69
NA,night] - I wish to bring before tbe House,69
NA,a matter which is causing great concern in,69
NA,my electorate. I have received an S 0 S,69
NA,"from nine families, in which they state",69
NA,that either tbe Government or the Army,69
NA,authorities propose to take over their,69
NA,homes. I understand that the buildings,69
NA,will be used by the American Army for a,69
NA,hospital of some kind. Why cannot,69
NA,the American Army acquire land and,69
NA,"erect buildings thereon, as the Australian",69
NA,Army does? Three of the nine homes in,69
NA,question are occupied by wives of men,69
NA,"in the fighting services, and another by",69
NA,the mother of a soldier. I n two other,69
NA,cases persons working in a munitions,69
NA,factory are concerned.,69
Mr FORDE ,I n what suburb are the,69
NA,homes situated?,69
Mr CONELAN ,The y are situated,69
NA,in the suburb of Ekibin. The occupants,69
NA,of the homes are probably not supporters,69
NA,"of the Labour party, but that does not",69
NA,affect the position so far as I am con-,69
NA,cerned. I received a telegram on this,69
NA,"subject yesterday, and to-day I received",69
NA,a long letter stating that the Government,69
NA,proposed to take this action under,69
NA,National Security Regulations. The occu-,69
NA,pants of the homes have been requested,69
NA,to make arrangements to band over tbe,69
NA,"buildings to the Chief Engineer, Base",69
NA,"Section No. 3, United States Army. Tbe",69
NA,Minister for the Army ( Mr Forde),69
NA,will know tbat i t is impossible to,69
NA,obtain other homes in these suburbs at,69
NA,the present time. The compensation,69
NA,proposed to be paid is far less than these,69
NA,people would have to pay for other houses,69
NA,"in the same locality, even i f they could be",69
NA,"obtained, and they are precluded by",69
NA,regulation from building other homes.,69
NA,For some time I bave urged tbat acquisi-,69
NA,tion and compensation committees be set,69
NA,up to deal with the hiring of properties,69
NA,that are being taken over by tbe military,69
NA,authorities. I have bad in mind particu-,69
NA,larly the many secondary schools which,69
NA,have been taken over without regard to the,69
NA,educational needs of the children affected.,69
NA,"In many instances, compensation adjust-",69
NA,ments have not been made in respect of,69
NA,properties taken over several months ago.,69
NA,I t is time that steps were taken to pre-,69
NA,vent a continuance of these acts.,69
NA,Although we are pleased to have the,69
NA,"Americans here, they should be placed",69
NA,on the same basis as tbe Australian,69
NA,Army in connexion with properties,69
NA,"required, by them. Instead of turning",69
NA,"nine families out of their homes, it would",69
NA,be better for the Government to acquire,69
NA,vacant land and provide temporary,69
NA,accommodation of the kind required by,69
NA,the American authorities. The Allied,69
NA,Works Council is erecting numerous,69
NA,buildings throughout Queensland for the,69
NA,"men under its control, and something of",69
NA,the same kind should be done in this,69
NA,instance. When we reflect that in respect,69
NA,of four of the nine homes relatives,69
NA,of men in the fighting services and tbat,69
NA,in two other instances munitions workers,69
NA,"are concerned, it will be seen that the pro-",69
NA,posed action will seriously affect persons,69
NA,who are rendering valuable service to the,69
NA,community. I t is not right that while,69
NA,men are fighting overseas on our behalf,69
NA,their dependants should be turned out,69
NA,"of their homes, and inadequate compen-",69
NA,sation be offered to them. I implore the,69
NA,Minister to take action -which will stop,70
NA,"this sort of thing. I n my opinion, the",70
NA,occupants of these homes should defy the,70
NA,hirings administration; but should they,70
NA,"be turned out, the Government should",70
NA,provide accommodation for them and see,70
NA,that they do not suffer any monetary,70
NA,loss. Most of the families concerned are,70
NA,"purchasing their homes, and have bought",70
NA,furniture and furnishings to suit them.,70
NA,. I f they are forced to rip up wall-to-wall,70
NA,carpets they will suffer monetary loss if,70
NA,they try to fit them to new premises.,70
NA,Should they have to vacate their homes,70
NA,the compensation payable to them should,70
NA,be adequate to meet all losses incurred.,70
NA,"I f there be no alternative, and these",70
NA,people have to be turned out of their,70
NA,"homes, the Government should purchase",70
NA,"the buildings outright, and enable their",70
NA,owners to purchase other homes else-,70
NA,"where, as it is practically impossible to",70
NA,rent other homes in the locality. I ask,70
NA,the Minister to ensure that these people,70
NA,are not victimized.,70
Mr SCULLY ,Gwydir-Ministe r for,70
NA,Commerce) [12.7 a.m.] - I shall reply,70
NA,briefly to several matters which have been,70
NA,raised. I am indebted to the honorable,70
NA,member for Swan ( Mr Marwick) for,70
NA,mentioning-the subject of superphosphate.,70
NA,I agree with him that it is essential that,70
NA,supplies of this commodity shall be made,70
NA,available so that it can be carted to the,70
NA,farm as back-loading when wheat is being,70
NA,delivered. I shall take tbe matter up,70
NA,immediately with the Superphosphate,70
NA,Committee with a view to making sup-,70
NA,plies available.,70
Mr MARWICK ,I t is not only a matter,70
NA,"of supplies. ""We also wish to know the",70
NA,basis on which supplies will be made,70
NA,available.,70
Mr SCULLY ,Ther e is a definite,70
NA,rationing basis. I thought that I had,70
NA,advised the Government of Western Aus-,70
NA,tralia that for 1943-44 the policy followed,70
NA,in 1942-43 will be continued.,70
NA,NA,70
Mr SCULLY ,I t will be followed as,70
NA,to tbe 33^ reduction and also in regard,70
NA,to compensation. Owing to the great,70
NA,surplus of wheat that is being accumu-,70
NA,"lated in Western Australia, the Govern-",70
NA,"ment intends to continue the 33£ per cent,",70
NA,reduction of the area to be sown with,70
NA,wheat.,70
Mr MARWICK ,Wh y not place super-,70
NA,phosphate on the same basis i n Western,70
NA,Australia as in tbe other States?,70
NA,Wheat lands in Western Australia are,70
NA,deteriorating.,70
Mr SCULLY , I agree with the,70
NA,"honorable member, and I shall take that",70
NA,aspect of the case into consideration at,70
NA,the earliest opportunity. The honorable,70
NA,member for Riverina ( Mr Wilson),70
NA,raised the subject of f.a.q. standards and,70
NA,dockages. I shall have the matter investi-,70
NA,"gated, and referred, immediately to the",70
NA,Australian Wheat Board. I shall also,70
NA,refer to the board the matter of weigh-,70
NA,bridge weights.,70
NA,The honorable member for Deakin,70
NA,( Mr Hutchinson) mentioned tbe resump-,70
NA,tion of land by the Department of the,70
NA,"Interior, and the payments made for it.",70
NA,I shall bring his remarks to the,70
NA,"notice of the Minister for the Interior,",70
NA,who will give the matter his prompt,70
NA,attention.,70
NA,The honorable member for Henty,70
NA,( Mr Coles) mentioned the acquisition of,70
NA,apples and pears in Victoria. I am,70
NA,indebted to the honorable member for,70
NA,having raised the subject. There must,70
NA,necessarily be some dislocation upon the,70
NA,"cessation of the scheme for acquisition,",70
NA,but steps will be taken to ensure that,70
NA,"growers receive supplies of cases, and",70
NA,that transport is made available.,70
NA,The honorable member for Forrest,70
NA,NA,70
NA,mation regarding potatoes which was,70
NA,news to me. I t is certainly not the inten-,70
NA,tion of the Government to inflict injustice,70
NA,on any section of the community. I f the,70
NA,primary producers bave been patriotic,70
NA,enough to meet the wishes of the Govern-,70
NA,"ment, the Government will see that they",70
NA,are not victimized.,70
Mr FORDE ,Capricornia-Ministe r,70
NA,for the Army) [12.15 p.m.] -Honor -,70
NA,able members on both sides of the House,70
NA,have pressed for the restoration of broad-,70
NA,casting facilities to the Wesley Church,70
NA,authorities in Melbourne. Ministers have,70
NA,been greatly impressed by the speeches,70
NA,"made, and I shall take the matter up with",70
NA,the Postmaster -.General (Senator,70
NA,"Ashley). As has been pointed out, the",70
NA,Australian Broadcasting Commission bas,70
NA,"been given, by Parliament, complete con-",70
NA,trol over broadcasting. The action of the,70
NA,commission was not taken at the instiga-,71
NA,tion of the Government; the commission,71
NA,has exercised the powers given to i t by,71
NA,Parliament. There has been friction for,71
NA,"some time, but I feel sure that the matter",71
NA,could be smoothed out after consultation,71
NA,between the commission and Dr Irving,71
NA,"Benson, the minister in chaTge of Wesley",71
NA,"Church. I have met this gentleman, and",71
NA,know him to be a very fine Australian,71
NA,citizen. He has provided facilities for,71
NA,"public men of all political parties, and",71
NA,distinguished visitors from other coun-,71
NA,"tries, to occupy the public forum in his",71
NA,church on Sunday afternoon. The Go-,71
NA,vernment wishes to be just to all sections,71
NA,of the community. Although full power,71
NA,was given to the Australian Broadcasting,71
NA,"Commission, it is within the province of",71
NA,the Postmaster-General and other Minis-,71
NA,ters to discuss matters of this kind with,71
NA,"members of the commission, and I hope",71
NA,"that, as a result of such discussion, a",71
NA,solution of the difficulty will be found.,71
NA,The honorable member for Wimmera,71
NA,( Mr Wilson) mentioned the Army I n -,71
NA,"ventions Directorate, and said that proper",71
NA,encouragement was not given to inven-,71
NA,tors. I shall take the matter up with the,71
NA,"directorate, a body which was set up by",71
NA,me because the previous Inventions Board,71
NA,was not working satisfactorily.,71
Mr CALWELL ,Ho w many inventions,71
NA,have been approved by the directorate?,71
Mr FORDE ," I cannot say offhand,",71
NA,but I could get the figures. Honorable,71
NA,members will understand tbat probably,71
NA,"99 per cent, of the inventions offered are",71
NA,found to be of no real value. Neverthe-,71
NA,"less, it is in the interests of the nation",71
NA,that encouragement should be given to,71
NA,"inventors, particularly in war-time. I",71
NA,"know, as Minister for the Army, that",71
NA,many helpful ideaB regarding military,71
NA,equipment have been offered from time,71
NA,to time by inventors. The Army I n -,71
NA,ventions Directorate consists of some of,71
NA,the most eminent engineers and scientists,71
NA,in Australia.,71
Mr MARWICK ,The y are very staid,71
NA,in their outlook.,71
Mr FORDE ,I t would be difficult to,71
NA,appoint a directorate that would satisfy,71
NA,every body. A man whose idea is,71
NA,rejected usually bas a grievance.,71
Mr MARWICK ,I f a politician gets on,71
NA,tbe job after an invention bas been re-,71
NA,"jected, the directorate will send an",71
NA,urgent wire to the inventor asking him,71
NA,to send over his invention immediately,71
NA,for examination.,71
Mr FORDE ,"I n some cases, the",71
NA,directorate has borne the expense of,71
NA,"bringing not only the invention, but also",71
NA,"the inventor, from other States, paying",71
NA,"the inventor's fare and expenses, while",71
NA,to the inspection is being carried out. Its,71
NA,members are actuated by the highest,71
NA,motives. They are doing a great service,71
NA,to the country.,71
Mr MARWICK , I shall have some-,71
NA,thing more to say on the matter on the,71
NA,motion for the adjournment to-morrow.,71
Mr FORDE , I suggest that the hon-,71
NA,orable member should discuss the matter,71
NA,with me in my office.,71
NA,The honorable member for Griffith,71
NA,( Mr Conelan) raised the matter of,71
NA,houses being taken over at Ekibin,71
NA,"Heights, Brisbane, by the American",71
NA,Army authorities for use as hospitals.,71
NA,[ shall have inquiries made into tbat,71
NA,matter. There is a Central Hirings Com-,71
NA,mi'ltee and a Hirings Committee operates,71
NA,in each State. State committees consider,71
NA,all applications from the services for,71
NA,accommodation of various kinds. I n some,71
NA,"cases, public schools, or buildings of other",71
NA,"kinds, are taken over for use by the",71
NA,services. Following Japan's entry into,71
NA,"the war, it became necessary immediately",71
NA,to provide additional hospital accommo-,71
NA,dation far beyond anything previously,71
NA,considered necessary. We do not have,71
NA,time to erect new buildings. Existing,71
NA,buildings bad to ibe taken over; and tbe,71
NA,inconvenience caused to occupants was,71
NA,"unavoidable. The Government, so far as",71
NA,"it could do so, discouraged the taking over",71
NA,"of public schools, but these buildings,",71
NA,"which contained large dormitories, were",71
NA,the only available .buildings suitable for,71
NA,base hospitals.,71
Mr CALWELL ,Som e serious mistakes,71
NA,have been made.,71
Mr FORDE , I do not propose to go,71
NA,into details. I shall not say tbat no,71
NA,mistakes have been made; but it is ad-,71
NA,visable to hear both sides of the question,71
NA,before one decides tbat a mistake has been,71
NA,made.,71
Mr CALWELL ,Wesle y College and,72
NA,"Melbourne Grammar School, Melbourne,",72
NA,should never have been taken over.,72
Mr FORDE ,Tha t is the honorable,72
NA,"gentleman's opinion. However, at that",72
NA,"time, additional accommodation had to be",72
NA,provided without delay. The Japanese,72
NA,were knocking at the door; our Army,72
NA,"was expanding threefold, and",72
NA,Americans were coming,72
NA,thousands. Accommodation had. to be,72
NA,found f or their staffs and equipment.,72
Mr MARWICK ," I n those days, people",72
NA,were only too glad to get away to the bush,72
NA,as quickly as possible.,72
Mr FORDE ,Ther e were evacuations,72
NA,"f r o m all capital cities, particularly f r o m",72
NA,"those on the eastern coast, and at tbat",72
NA,time the occupants of these buildings,72
NA,were glad to hand them over to the m i l i -,72
NA,"tary authorities. However, when the posi-",72
NA,"tion became calmer, and tbe danger of",72
NA,Japanese invasion became less probable,72
NA,many of these people were desirous of re-,72
NA,occupying the buildings. The Government,72
NA,has always been sympathetic towards,72
NA,these people to whom inconvenience has,72
NA,been caused i n 'that way; and i t is the,72
NA,Government's desire to vacate the build-,72
NA,ings to them as soon as possible.,72
NA,"However, our paramount",72
NA,tion must be the,72
NA,the defences of the country.,72
NA,Hirings Committee i n each State decides,72
NA,which buildings shall be taken over and,72
NA,the compensation or rental to be paid.,72
NA,"Should the owners, or occupants, of any",72
NA,building which is taken over feel that,72
NA,"they are not being dealt with f a i r l y , they",72
NA,can appeal to the Compensation Board i n,72
NA,each State. I t is impossible to please,72
NA,"every body i n this matter, but I believe",72
NA,that machinery has been set up to give,72
NA,equitable treatment to all concerned.,72
NA,I shall bring the subject of censor-,72
NA,ship raised by the honorable member commodities,72
NA,for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) to the,72
NA,notice of the Prime Minister.,72
Mr CALWELL ,Abou t Sir Keith,72
NA,Murdoch ?,72
Mr FORDE , A t this late hour I do,72
NA,not propose to go into details. The Goorable member's,72
NA,vernment desires that tbe press shall be,72
NA,as free as possible. I t does not stand f o r,72
NA,political censorship. Tbe principle upon referred,72
NA,which tbe censorship is conducted,72
NA,already been set out by the Prime,72
NA,Minister.,72
Mr CALWELL , Sir K e i t h Murdoch is,72
NA,obliged by law to submit his articles to,72
NA,the censor. W h y should he be given,72
NA,preferential treatment because he is,72
NA,irresponsible ?,72
Mr FORDE , I am not conversant,72
NA,tbe with the censorship restrictions.,72
Mr CALWELL , Sir K e i t h Murdoch is,72
NA,obliged to submit his material to tbe,72
NA,censor. W i l l the Minister see tbat he,72
NA,obeys the censor's instructions?,72

NA,BILLS,19
NA,Corporations Amendment (Professional Standards of Financial Advisers) Bill,19
NA,2016,19
NA,First Reading,19
NA,Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms O'Dwyer.,19
NA,Bill read a first time.,19
NA,Second Reading,19
Ms ODWYER ,Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (09:31): I move:,19
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,19
NA,"Today I introduce a bill that will amend the Corporations Act. It will raise the education,",19
NA,training and ethical standards of financial advisers by requiring financial advisers to hold a,19
NA,"degree, undertake a professional year, pass an exam, undertake continuous professional",19
NA,development and comply with a code of ethics.,19
NA,"In introducing this bill today, we are implementing our commitment set out in the",19
NA,"government's response to the Financial System Inquiry (FSI). With its introduction, we are",19
NA,also responding to recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on,19
NA,"Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into proposals to lift the professional, ethical and",19
NA,education standards in the financial services industry.,19
NA,This government is committed to ensuring Australia has a financial services regulatory,19
NA,regime that enhances confidence and trust by fostering an environment in which financial,19
NA,firms treat customers fairly.,19
NA,Creating a holistic professional standards framework to raise the competency and,19
NA,professionalism of financial advisers is an important part of our commitment.,19
NA,Raising the professional standards of financial advisers will play a significant role in,19
NA,"improving consumer trust in the financial advice industry, which has had repeated instances",19
NA,of inappropriate behaviour.,19
NA,"Reduced trust acts as a barrier to consumers seeking financial advice, which is an",19
NA,extremely poor outcome for both consumers and industry.,19
NA,"We probably should not be surprised then, that right now only one in every five Australians",19
NA,seeks financial advice.,19
NA,Appropriate financial advice can significantly improve people's financial wellbeing. That is,19
NA,why we simply must improve trust in the industry so that consumers can have confidence in,19
NA,"the advice they are seeking-so that they can have recourse to the kind of strategic advice,",19
NA,expertise and knowledge that most everyday people do not normally hold.,19
NA,NA,19
NA,"Equally important is the sustainable future of the financial advice industry, which is",20
NA,integral to our economy.,20
NA,I note that the proposed reforms follow important steps already taken by the government to,20
NA,improve the transparency and accountability of financial advice.,20
NA,We have already established a register of financial advisers that allows consumers to verify,20
NA,the credentials of financial advisers and be confident that they are appropriately qualified and,20
NA,experienced.,20
NA,We are also progressing reforms to life insurance advice remuneration structures. These,20
NA,reforms are an important step in addressing concerns that remuneration incentives are,20
NA,affecting the quality of advice provided to consumers and encouraging the unnecessary,20
NA,turnover of policies.,20
NA,"The government has consulted extensively on the measures in this bill, which build on the",20
NA,"model proposed by the PJC on Corporations and Financial Services, chaired by my colleague",20
NA,"Senator David Fawcett, and the recommendations of the FSI. This is an excellent example of",20
NA,different segments of industry working together to build a workable model.,20
NA,I note that both the FSI and PJC reviews identified that the existing professional standards,20
NA,for financial advisers are too low and do not ensure that all financial advisers have the,20
NA,necessary skills to provide high-quality advice to consumers.,20
NA,These reviews recognise that the current regulatory framework was not enough to build,20
NA,professionalism in the financial advice industry and has not encouraged this industry to take a,20
NA,greater lead in setting standards.,20
NA,It is clear that the current framework lacks the incentives to encourage industry to go above,20
NA,and beyond the minimum.,20
NA,"For example, under the current law, advisers can become qualified to provide financial",20
NA,"advice after just four days of training, and there are no specific ongoing training requirements",20
NA,beyond that.,20
NA,"There is now widespread support among industry, consumer groups, the government and",20
NA,"parliament to raise education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers.",20
NA,It is clear that the time is right and we must take advantage of this momentum.,20
NA,The establishment of the standards body will be the first important step on the road to,20
NA,professionalism.,20
NA,"Under this proposed legislation, we will establish a standards body, as a Commonwealth",20
NA,"company limited guarantee, to set education standards, professional year and continuing",20
NA,professional development requirements.,20
NA,The body will also develop an exam and a comprehensive code of ethics for all financial,20
NA,advisers.,20
NA,Establishing the standards body as a Commonwealth company will balance the body's,20
NA,independence with industry and consumer engagement.,20
NA,It will also minimise the government's footprint and allow for the possibility of easily,20
NA,transferring the standards body back to industry once trust and confidence in the sector is,20
NA,restored.,20
NA,NA,20
NA,"The government will have no direct control over the entity's day-to-day operations, but,",21
NA,"should the body not comply with its obligations, the responsible minister may give the body a",21
NA,written direction.,21
NA,Such a direction would only occur in very exceptional circumstances.,21
NA,"The government will be responsible for all appointments to the board, which will comprise",21
NA,"an independent chair, three industry representatives, three consumer representatives, an",21
NA,academic and an ethicist.,21
NA,Industry will have a key role in the proposed model and will be consulted extensively as,21
NA,the body sets standards.,21
NA,This is critical because industry must have a stake in the standards-making process if it is,21
NA,to be truly professional and to develop standards above the minimum.,21
NA,"Under the reforms, financial advisers who provide personal advice to retail clients on more",21
NA,complex products will need to meet these new standards.,21
NA,Financial advisers who are only authorised to provide general advice or personal advice on,21
NA,"less complex financial products, such as general insurance, will not be required to comply",21
NA,with the new standards.,21
NA,The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will continue to set education and,21
NA,training standards for advisers who are only authorised to provide general advice or advice on,21
NA,less complex products.,21
NA,"New financial advisers will require a degree, while existing advisers will need to meet a",21
NA,standard equivalent to a degree set by the standards body.,21
NA,"While the detail will ultimately be set by the new standards body, it is important to note",21
NA,that not all existing advisers will have to return to university and complete a three-year degree,21
NA,program.,21
NA,"Some may not, but a majority are likely to receive credit for the education or training that",21
NA,they have already completed and will need only to gap-fill or undertake bridging courses to,21
NA,meet the standard required.,21
NA,Existing advisers have from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2024 to meet the new education,21
NA,standards.,21
NA,While I commend the actions of some licensees who have already introduced a degree,21
NA,"requirement for their financial advisers, government action is necessary in this space to ensure",21
NA,minimum standards apply across the whole industry.,21
NA,The FSI found that low adviser competence was a factor in many of the recent high-profile,21
NA,instances of consumers receiving inappropriate financial advice and contributed to the low,21
NA,demand for financial advice.,21
NA,The fact that an adviser could reach accreditation in four days has given the industry a bad,21
NA,image.,21
NA,That is obviously not good enough and there is clearly room to do better if the industry is,21
NA,to reach its true potential.,21
NA,A core feature of these reforms is the requirement that all advisers complete an exam set by,21
NA,the new standards body.,21
NA,NA,21
NA,"Such a requirement already exists in the United States, Britain, Canada, Singapore and",22
NA,Hong Kong.,22
NA,New advisers will need to complete the exam from 1 January 2019. Existing advisers will,22
NA,have from this date until 1 January 2021 to pass the exam.,22
NA,"Collectively with the other measures in this bill, the exam will play a significant role in",22
NA,improving professional standards of financial advisers.,22
NA,It will objectively test and strengthen the practical and ethical knowledge of existing,22
NA,advisers with immediate effect and will help renew confidence in the industry without,22
NA,significant lag times.,22
NA,"From 1 January 2019, all new entrants will need to undertake a professional year set by the",22
NA,new standards body.,22
NA,This will involve at least one year of work and training to ensure that new entrants are,22
NA,mentored and assessed before they are fully authorised to provide unsupervised advice to,22
NA,clients.,22
NA,"Under the reforms, new entrants who have completed their degree and passed the exam",22
NA,will be able to provide advice on a supervised basis during the professional year.,22
NA,The professional year trainee will be required to disclose to clients that they are completing,22
NA,the professional year and that they are not permitted to give advice unsupervised.,22
NA,The Register of Financial Advisers will clearly show that the person is completing their,22
NA,professional year and only authorised to give advice under strict supervision.,22
NA,A supervising adviser will need to ensure that the new financial adviser is appropriately,22
NA,supervised and take responsibility for all advice given by the new financial adviser during the,22
NA,professional year.,22
NA,The standards body will develop guidelines on what constitutes 'appropriate supervision'.,22
NA,Existing advisers will not need to undertake a professional year.,22
NA,"All advisers, both new and existing, will be required to undertake continuing professional",22
NA,development.,22
NA,The new standards body will determine the requirements for continuing professional,22
NA,"development, including the number of hours that advisers need to complete and which courses",22
NA,satisfy the requirements.,22
NA,This requirement will ensure financial advisers are keeping up to date with relevant,22
NA,"training, information, skills and knowledge to make sure that they remain competent in",22
NA,providing advice to consumers.,22
NA,Roy Morgan reported in its 2014 State of the nation report that only 25 per cent of,22
NA,Australians rate financial planners' standards of ethics and honesty as 'very high' or 'high'.,22
NA,This percentage must improve if the financial services industry is to meet the expectations,22
NA,of consumers.,22
NA,"In a more recent survey, up to 85 per cent of practicing financial advisers indicated that",22
NA,they support the introduction of a single unified code of ethics.,22
NA,It is clear that financial advisers are hearing these concerns.,22
NA,NA,22
NA,"On the back of these concerns and the recommendations by the PJC, the government is",23
NA,requiring all financial advisers to subscribe to a code of ethics by 1 January 2020.,23
NA,The new standards body will establish a single uniform code of ethics that will set out,23
NA,principles designed to help financial advisers conduct business honestly and with integrity.,23
NA,"All financial advisers will need to be covered by an ASIC approved compliance scheme,",23
NA,which will set out how the code will be monitored and enforced.,23
NA,"The compliance scheme will set out the arrangements for monitoring compliance, the",23
NA,"sanctions for breaching the code, the process for consumers to make complaints, and the",23
NA,process for resolving disputes between the monitoring body and the financial adviser.,23
NA,The compliance scheme will specify which 'monitoring body' is responsible for enforcing,23
NA,compliance-this could be either a professional association or a third party who is,23
NA,independent of the licensee.,23
NA,"It is important to note the significant role that professional associations, independent third",23
NA,parties and licensees will play in implementing these reforms.,23
NA,These institutions will be directly responsible for ensuring financial advisers comply with,23
NA,the new standards.,23
NA,Professional associations are likely to offer training and education services to their,23
NA,"members, to assist them to prepare and to meet the new standards.",23
NA,"I note that many of these associations, particularly those in the Industry Consensus Group,",23
NA,have been instrumental in the development of these reforms.,23
NA,I would like to thank Senator David Fawcett and the members of the PJC for their,23
NA,important contributions and I also wish to acknowledge the work of my predecessors.,23
NA,It is anticipated that the new standards body will be established by mid-2017.,23
NA,"The new education, exam, professional year and continuing professional development",23
NA,requirements apply from 1 January 2019.,23
NA,Existing advisers will have until 1 January 2021 to pass the exam and 1 January 2024 to,23
NA,meet the degree-equivalent requirement.,23
NA,The provisions relating to the code of ethics take effect from 1 January 2020.,23
NA,"In closing, I note that these reforms represent a necessary and valuable change to the",23
NA,"current regulatory environment for financial advisers, and are important steps in",23
NA,professionalising the industry.,23
NA,"Not only will they deliver significant benefits to consumers, they will also help maintain",23
NA,trust and confidence in the financial system. I commend the bill to the House.,23
NA,Debate adjourned.,23
NA,Crimes Legislation Amendment (International Crime Cooperation and Other,23
NA,Measures) Bill 2016,23
NA,First Reading,23
NA,Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Keenan.,23
NA,Bill read a first time.,23
NA,NA,23
NA,Second Reading,24
Mr KEENAN ,Stirling-Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister,24
NA,for Counter-Terrorism) (09:46): I move:,24
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,24
NA,The government is committed to ensuring Australia's criminal justice framework is as strong,24
NA,as it can be-striking the right balance between protecting fundamental rights while ensuring,24
NA,justice is served. We are committed to ensuring our law enforcement and justice agencies,24
NA,have the requisite powers to appropriately contribute to the fight against crime at home and,24
NA,abroad.,24
NA,"To that end, we keep our criminal justice framework under constant review-our agencies,",24
NA,"policies, laws and processes-to ensure that we have a regime in place that is well equipped",24
NA,for the job of tackling crime.,24
NA,The bill about which I speak today-the Crimes Legislation Amendment (International,24
NA,Crime Cooperation and Other Measures) Bill 2016-is an another example of our efforts in,24
NA,this respect. It is a comprehensive bill-11 schedules in length-which contains a range of,24
NA,measures that will strengthen the Commonwealth's already robust criminal justice,24
NA,arrangements.,24
NA,"The bill will enhance Australia's position globally in the fight against crime, making",24
NA,improvements to our international crime cooperation arrangements and our ability to assist,24
NA,international courts and tribunals.,24
NA,It will make amendments to the Commonwealth's Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-,24
NA,Terrorism Financing Act to both strengthen that regime and make reporting requirements,24
NA,within it more flexible.,24
NA,"It will amend the AusCheck Act to bolster the government's ability to address serious risks,",24
NA,"such as national security and safety risks, related to large-scale events of a national character.",24
NA,The bill will also enhance the Commonwealth's anti-human trafficking and slavery regime,24
NA,and the protections afforded to vulnerable witnesses within our criminal justice system.,24
NA,"Finally, the bill will make a number of minor amendments to:",24
NA," streamline the annual reporting processes under the War Crimes Act, and",24
NA," enhance the Australian Federal Police's drug and alcohol testing arrangements, enabling it",24
NA,to maintain the integrity of its workforce and enforce its zero-tolerance policy regarding,24
NA,illicit drug use.,24
NA,The bill also contains minor consequential amendments to facilitate the use of the,24
NA,Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission as an alternative name for the Australian Crime,24
NA,Commission.,24
NA,I do not propose elaborating in detail on all of the measures I have just outlined that are,24
NA,"contained in the bill. I would, however, like to draw the attention to some of the more",24
NA,significant measures.,24
NA,International crime cooperation measures,24
NA,"As many of us here appreciate, international crime cooperation is an essential part of",24
NA,fighting crime in Australia and across the world.,24
NA,NA,24
NA,Australia needs to ensure that criminals cannot evade prosecution or profit from crime,25
NA,"because the evidence or proceeds of their crimes are located in different countries, or because",25
NA,they can move easily across borders.,25
NA,Amendments in the bill will ensure Australia can respond effectively to requests for,25
NA,"assistance from foreign countries and international bodies, in accordance with our",25
NA,international obligations. They will also ensure that the rules on adducing foreign material in,25
NA,Australian proceedings apply consistently throughout Australia. The amendments have been,25
NA,identified from practical experience and will provide certainty in the operation of key,25
NA,provisions.,25
NA,"Specifically, the bill will enhance Australia's ability to assist international courts and",25
NA,tribunals. These bodies are responsible for investigating and prosecuting individuals accused,25
NA,"of committing the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, including",25
NA,"the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.",25
NA,The bill will align the assistance Australia can provide to the International Criminal Court,25
NA,and international war crimes tribunals with the assistance we can provide in criminal matters,25
NA,to foreign countries. Australia's authority to provide assistance to these bodies is currently,25
NA,more limited than our capacity to assist foreign countries. The bill will permit forensic,25
NA,"procedures, surveillance activities and telecommunications information to the international",25
NA,bodies.,25
NA,The assistance would be subject to the same processes that currently apply to the assistance,25
NA,provided to foreign countries and to similar safeguards that apply to the use of these powers,25
NA,for foreign and domestic law enforcement purposes.,25
NA,"The bill will also amend Australia's mutual assistance regime, to enhance the assistance",25
NA,that Australia can provide in response to a mutual assistance request from a foreign country in,25
NA,a criminal matter.,25
NA,These amendments will ensure that proceeds of crime investigative tools in the Mutual,25
NA,Assistance Act align with those in the Proceeds of Crime Act. They will also modify,25
NA,provisions in the Proceeds of Crime Act appropriately for the foreign context.,25
NA,The amendments will also clarify the types of foreign proceeds of crime orders for which,25
NA,mutual assistance can be provided and confirm that the Mutual Assistance Act applies to,25
NA,interim foreign proceeds of crime orders that are issued by non-judicial government bodies.,25
NA,The bill will also amend the Extradition Act to ensure that judicial officers and relevant,25
NA,courts have sufficient powers to order the remand of a person in an appropriate facility to,25
NA,await extradition following a surrender decision. This will improve the operation of the,25
NA,extradition process and assist Australia to meet its international extradition obligations.,25
NA,"Finally, the bill will also make amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act. These",25
NA,amendments will ensure consistent application of the rules relating to foreign evidence,25
NA,throughout Australia.,25
NA,They will provide a process to certify material received from a foreign country in response,25
NA,to a mutual assistance request in terrorism-related proceedings. This will ensure that the,25
NA,certification is prima facie evidence of the fact of such receipt.,25
NA,Vulnerable witness protections,25
NA,NA,25
NA,I would also like to highlight the bill's proposed enhancements to the Commonwealth's,26
NA,existing vulnerable witness protections.,26
NA,The government is committed to supporting and protecting vulnerable witnesses giving,26
NA,evidence in Commonwealth criminal proceedings.,26
NA,The amendments will ensure the existing offence of identifying child witnesses or,26
NA,vulnerable adult complainants also extends to child complainants.,26
NA,The bill will also amend relevant legislation to clarify that the protections afforded to,26
NA,"vulnerable witnesses apply to future criminal proceedings, regardless of when the alleged",26
NA,offence occurred.,26
NA,"In relation to the Commonwealth's human trafficking and slavery offences, the bill seeks to",26
NA,broaden the definition of 'debt bondage'. It will also expand the relevant evidence that may be,26
NA,taken into account in determining elements of human trafficking and slavery-related offences.,26
NA,Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing amendments,26
NA,In respect of the Commonwealth's anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing,26
NA,"framework, the bill makes several amendments. Firstly, to allow travellers departing Australia",26
NA,"to electronically report cross-border movements of physical currency-currently, travellers",26
NA,"who are carrying $10,000 or more in cash must provide a written report at a specific time and",26
NA,"point. The proposed amendments will maintain existing reporting requirements, but provide",26
NA,the necessary flexibility to ensure that a new digital form can also be used.,26
NA,The bill will also list the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission-the,26
NA,ACNC-as a designated agency under the AML/CTF Act. This will enable the ACNC to,26
NA,access financial intelligence information to assess money laundering and terrorist financing,26
NA,"risks associated with charities that register with the ACNC. In turn, this will enable the ACNC",26
NA,"to better detect, monitor and halt money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal",26
NA,activities involving ACNC-registered entities.,26
NA,AusCheck Act amendments,26
NA,"Finally, I would like to mention the AusCheck Act amendments.",26
NA,"These will enable AusCheck, a business unit within the Attorney-General's Department, to",26
NA,conduct and coordinate background checks in relation to major national events such as the,26
NA,2018 Commonwealth Games.,26
NA,"These amendments will enable the government to prevent persons who pose serious risks,",26
NA,"such as persons of national security concern, from working or volunteering at major national",26
NA,events and contributing to serious incidents.,26
NA,The amendments will provide me-as the minister-with a power to declare a major,26
NA,national event by legislative instrument. They will also permit regulations to be made in,26
NA,relation to the conduct and coordination of background checks for a major national event.,26
NA,The term 'major national event' is intended to capture a type of event that is of such a large,26
NA,scale and national character that it would benefit from the coordination of security and other,26
NA,arrangements by the Commonwealth or across more than one jurisdiction in Australia. Some,26
NA,"examples of events that, if held in Australia, could be characterised as major national events",26
NA,"include the Commonwealth Games, the G20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting",26
NA,"and major international sporting events. In declaring an event as a major national event, I-as",26
NA,NA,26
NA,the minister-must be satisfied that it is in the national interest that the Commonwealth be,27
NA,involved in the conduct and coordination of background checks in connection with the,27
NA,accreditation of people in relation to the event.,27
NA,Using the established AusCheck scheme for these purposes will ensure that the background,27
NA,"checks can be facilitated through established mechanisms, which are well supported by",27
NA,technical channels and legal frameworks.,27
NA,Conclusion,27
NA,Australia's criminal justice framework is both fair and strong. But it never serves to be,27
NA,"complacent. Where we find opportunities to fine-tune aspects of our regime, we will take",27
NA,"these up. This bill, which is very comprehensive in nature, is an example of the government",27
NA,doing exactly that.,27
NA,Debate adjourned.,27
NA,MOTIONS,27
NA,Equal Rights,27
NA,Reference to Federation Chamber,27
Ms MARINO ,Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (09:57): I declare that the following,27
NA,"order of the day, government business, is referred to the Federation Chamber for debate:",27
NA,Equal rights for all Australians-Resumption of debate on the motion of the Prime Minister.,27
NA,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,27
NA,Annual Investment Statement,27
Mr CIOBO ,"Moncrieff-Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (09:57): by",27
NA,leave-I have the honour to present the coalition's third Investment Statement to the,27
NA,parliament.,27
NA,Introduction–why investment,27
NA,This annual statement is to update the parliament-and the Australian people-on our,27
NA,work promoting Australia as a place for productive foreign investment. There are many strong,27
NA,views on the sort of investment Australia should accept. This is an important and welcome,27
NA,discussion and we need to engage with the range of views expressed by the Australian,27
NA,community.,27
NA,"Like most important things, there are sensitivities, risks and opportunities. However, it is",27
NA,only by examining them and considering our options that we can best respond and make sure,27
NA,we are doing the right thing. At a time when there are questions around globalisation and,27
NA,rising protectionist sentiment I do not resile from liberalisation and this investment statement,27
NA,is an opportunity to explain why.,27
NA,"I have just come from the APEC ministers' meeting in Peru, where I saw firsthand how",27
NA,Australia's leadership is continuing to shape the development and implementation of pro-,27
NA,growth trade and investment rules and standards in our region. Liberalised trade and openness,27
NA,to foreign investment builds productive economies-this is how we prosper and grow.,27
NA,Foreign investment in context,27
NA,"Australia is the world's sixth largest landmass, with the world's 13th biggest economy, but",27
NA,ranks only 52nd by population. So it is only natural that our tremendous national endowments,27
NA,NA,27
NA,generate greater investment opportunities than we can fund from our own savings. We have,28
NA,been tapping savings from abroad-foreign investment-for almost every decade for at least,28
NA,150 years.,28
NA,"By supplementing our savings with the savings of others from overseas, we drive more",28
NA,"investment here at home, generating higher growth, more jobs with higher wages, and raise",28
NA,"more tax revenue to fund for example our schools and hospitals, than if we only invested what",28
NA,we saved ourselves and shunned foreign investment.,28
NA,That is why the coalition government expanded the traditional role of trade minister to be,28
NA,"the minister for investment as well. My job as minister for investment, and the work of my",28
NA,"agencies, is to promote and attract productive foreign investment and to ensure Australia",28
NA,remains an attractive destination for that investment.,28
NA,This means investment that:,28
NA, builds on our strengths,28
NA, helps us retain and create new jobs,28
NA, build competitive industries here at home; and,28
NA, helps us deliver our expertise to the world.,28
NA,The areas this government has made a priority-in partnership with Australia's states and,28
NA,territories-are these areas which back our strengths:,28
NA, major infrastructure,28
NA, tourism infrastructure,28
NA, food and agribusiness,28
NA, resources and energy; and,28
NA," advanced manufacturing, services and technologies",28
NA,"To support these priorities, since 2013 the coalition has:",28
NA, Delivered Australia a unique 'FTA investment advantage'. The North Asian FTAs deliver,28
NA,"unmatched preferential access, providing a powerful incentive for investors to expand",28
NA,businesses here and hire more workers to capitalise on our newly-won trade advantage in,28
NA,these key markets.,28
NA," Held around 100 investment roundtables with companies investing, or interested to invest,",28
NA,in Australia. I have hosted 28 of these since February this year as well as many bilateral,28
NA,"investment meetings that have encouraged new investment, helped maintain our",28
NA,"relationships with existing investors, and helped resolve issues and facilitate investment",28
NA,that otherwise may not have happened.,28
NA, - Because we know that most new foreign direct investment is additional; re-investment by,28
NA,those who already see the value of investing in Australia.,28
NA," Austrade, our investment attraction agency, has recorded 271 new investment outcomes,",28
NA,"with a reported value of almost A$17 billion, creating or safeguarding at least 30,000 jobs",28
NA,here in Australia.,28
NA," Over this term, I will continue to promote Australia as a destination for global investment",28
NA,"dollars, to drive jobs and growth.",28
NA,NA,28
NA,In 2015 the stock of foreign investment in Australia was made up of portfolio and other,29
NA,"investment, representing some $2.3 trillion, and foreign direct investment, representing some",29
NA,"$735 billion, for a total of around $3 trillion.",29
NA,"The major sources of this investment were the United States, some $860 billion, the United",29
NA,"Kingdom, around $500 billion, the remainder of the EU, representing some $491 billion, and",29
NA,"Japan, of some $200 billion. Chinese investment is growing rapidly from a low base and at",29
NA,the end of 2015 represented around A$75 billion. The emergence of China is the latest in,29
NA,successive waves of foreign investment in our history which started with the United,29
NA,"Kingdom, then the United States and then Japan.",29
NA,The quantum of new foreign direct investment into Australia in 2015 was valued at $117.9,29
NA,billion. This was down some $38.7-or roughly 24.7 per cent-on the amount invested into,29
NA,Australia in 2014.,29
NA,These trends are outlined in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's third annual,29
NA,International Investment Report which I will release today.,29
NA,"Although annual investment data tends to be lumpy, with large investments in one year-",29
NA,"such as through the recent peak of the LNG investment boom-which causes spikes, these",29
NA,figures show that we cannot be complacent about our attractiveness as a destination for,29
NA,foreign investment.,29
NA,"Amidst subdued global growth, there is fierce competition for global investment. So",29
NA,"Australia must redouble its efforts if we are to remain internationally competitive, to attract",29
NA,"new investment, to retain and expand existing investment, and thereby safeguard Australian",29
NA,jobs.,29
NA,This means ensuring Australia keeps up with the pack in terms of a globally and regional,29
NA,competitive corporate tax rate-this is why the coalition plans to lower company tax to 25 per,29
NA,cent over the medium term.,29
NA,This means providing an attractive environment for start-ups and entrepreneurs-as was,29
NA,introduced last year through the coalition's National Innovation and Science Agenda.,29
NA,This means deepening our trade and investment relationships with key markets including,29
NA,"Indonesia, the European Union and the United Kingdom; and progressing transformational",29
NA,"regional agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, to link us",29
NA,into regional value chains.,29
NA,"As for the TPP, the government has been clear on the very substantial new opportunities",29
NA,"for our exporters and investors that would flow from this agreement, in particular the creation",29
NA,of a more seamless trade and investment environment across the region. My recent meetings,29
NA,in Lima revealed a widespread view among all TPP parties on the value of the deal. We have,29
NA,since seen public comments by President-elect Trump which appear to signal an intention to,29
NA,withdraw from the TPP. We will need to wait for more detail from the US administration after,29
NA,"it has come to office, but in the meantime the Australian government remains committed to",29
NA,"pushing to realise the high ambition, comprehensive outcomes that were embedded in the",29
NA,TPP.,29
NA,Importance of foreign investment,29
NA,NA,29
NA,"Australia has long had export awards, but we are introducing something new this year. A",30
NA,national investment award.,30
NA,"Tomorrow night, I will announce the winner of our inaugural Investment Award.",30
NA,"This award will highlight some of the enduring, substantial, creative and new investments",30
NA,in our country that we should recognise and celebrate.,30
NA,"If we look at the nominees for the inaugural Investment Award, put forward by states and",30
NA,"territories and Austrade, those seven companies and their joint venture partners have invested",30
NA,"more than A$138 billion in Australia and created or retained over 53,000 jobs.",30
NA,We will be talking more about those seven in the coming days.,30
NA,"More generally, if you look at the 37 per cent of Australia's top 2,000 companies that are",30
NA,"foreign-owned, these companies firms account for A$1.1 trillion of assets in Australia,",30
NA,"generate revenue of A$629.3 billion and employed nearly 700,000 people in 2014-2015.",30
NA,It is important we celebrate the jobs that new investment drives. Not everyone sees the,30
NA,"value of investment openness. As with liberalised trade, some see it as a threat to their",30
NA,"standard of living, rather than an opportunity to improve it.",30
NA,"When it comes to investment, we often hear about the bad but not the good. The nature of",30
NA,news means the factory that is closing gets more coverage than the one opening.,30
NA,"You have heard about the Ford plant closing, but not the $1 billion Boeing has invested in",30
NA,Australia that is creating opportunities for engineering and machining companies to diversify,30
NA,and win new markets in the international aerospace market.,30
NA,"This is the case for Lovitt Technologies, a supplier to Boeing, one of the finalists,",30
NA,"incidentally, for the investment awards.",30
NA,"Australia has had an enviable 25 years of economic growth, but this does not mean people",30
NA,have been unaffected by the challenges posed by disruptive technologies and global,30
NA,competition.,30
NA,I know people are concerned about whether we can overcome these challenges.,30
NA,Whether working hard will be sufficient to hold on to their jobs and their standard of,30
NA,living.,30
NA,Whether our children will have the same opportunities to build good lives.,30
NA,Whether our economic success story can continue.,30
NA,"Productive foreign investment, the investment this government promotes, is one of our best",30
NA,ways of confidently meeting those challenges.,30
NA,Investment from outside of Australia has been critical to the development of our world-,30
NA,leading export industries.,30
NA,Our mining boom would not have happened without foreign investment to develop the,30
NA,"infrastructure, expertise and supply chains around the world we needed to make us the global",30
NA,resources powerhouse we are today.,30
NA,"For example, companies like Mitsui, whose long term investments and joint ventures in",30
NA,"Australia employ an estimated 20,000 Australians, were instrumental in the development of",30
NA,the Pilbara's iron ore and the Bowen Basin's coal.,30
NA,NA,30
NA,"With Australia's transition to a new economy, opportunities in renewable energy are",31
NA,"driving significant investments, particularly in hydro, wind and solar.",31
NA,"Companies like Neoen, from France, RATCH, from Thailand, and Goldwind from China",31
NA,are helping Australia reach its clean energy targets.,31
NA,Investment award nominee Neoen out of France has close to A$1 billion investment,31
NA,"planned to date, including projects in South Australia, Western Australia and New South",31
NA,Wales. Neoen sees ongoing opportunities in Australia across all states and is ready to commit,31
NA,another A$1 billion in renewable energy projects by 2020.,31
NA,"And, Australia is poised to become the world's largest exporter of LNG, when major",31
NA,projects come online. Projects like US company Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone,31
NA,"developments in WA, and Japanese company Inpex's Ichthys project in Darwin.",31
NA,These investments support the growth of smalland medium-size businesses like Total,31
NA,"Marine Technology in Bibra Lake, Western Australia, whose CEO Paul Colley says:",31
NA,We weren't sure our credentials were established enough to supply … to a project as large as,31
NA,Gorgon. Chevron listened to us and TMT was awarded one of the most significant contracts in our,31
NA,"history. … In addition to doubling our number of employees, we've grown internationally with offices",31
NA,in Brazil and Malaysia.,31
NA,"We understand that in today's global world it is important for small Australian businesses, the",31
NA,"engine room of our economy, to be part of the global economy.",31
NA,Global value chains-where many countries are involved in producing a final good or,31
NA,service-now support 75 per cent of the world's trade and investment activity.,31
NA,Boeing's investment in Australia is a great example of foreign investment that is creating,31
NA,"jobs, driving innovation and supporting access to global value chains at the same time.",31
NA,"In Melbourne alone, Boeing has created jobs for around 1,200 Australians who make",31
NA,control surfaces and flaps for Boeing aircraft at Fisherman's Bend.,31
NA,Working with the CSIRO-and ten local universities-Boeing's R&D investment in,31
NA,Australia has also helped us to become world leaders in developing new aviation products.,31
NA,And Boeing's global supply chain has supported Australian companies win global supply,31
NA,"contracts. In 2015 alone, more than 1,000 Australian companies were suppliers in Boeing's",31
NA,"global supply chain. That year, Boeing spent approximately $400 million on its Australian",31
NA,suppliers. Companies like Lovitt Technologies that have worked with Boeing for over 20,31
NA,years.,31
NA,"Bruce Ramsay, Lovitt's Manufacturing Director says, 'Working with Boeing has given",31
NA,Lovitt the opportunity to grow from an automotive tooling supplier into a globally,31
NA,competitive aerospace component manufacturer.',31
NA,"Let me be perfectly clear, this is investment that enables Australian businesses to connect",31
NA,with multinational companies.,31
NA,It is investment that brings enduring jobs in Australia.,31
NA,Investment is a two-way street,31
NA,"Let's not forget-Australia does not just receive investment from overseas, we have",31
NA,significant investment abroad.,31
NA,NA,31
NA,We want an open and transparent global playing field for trade and investment. And,32
NA,Australia is helping to drive those objectives regionally and globally-in the G20 through,32
NA,"developing guiding principles for investment policymakers and in the FTAs that we negotiate,",32
NA,including provisions to support Australian firms' ability to deliver goods and services,32
NA,overseas.,32
NA,Promoting global openness matters for Australian companies. More than two-thirds of the,32
NA,"goods and services supplied by Australia to the European Union, New Zealand and the United",32
NA,"States are by Australian firms on the ground in those countries, using Australian skills and",32
NA,expertise.,32
NA,"For example, when I was in London recently I rode the iconic red London buses, operated",32
NA,by Australia's very own Transit Systems which runs part of the bus network in London and,32
NA,also in Singapore.,32
NA,Government is protecting the national interest,32
NA,The Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) monitors foreign investment to ensure it is,32
NA,not against our national interest. It is important to note that just because we accept foreign,32
NA,investment we do not lose the ability to set the rules that all companies (both domestic and,32
NA,foreign-owned) must comply with.,32
NA,"All companies are subject to our legislation and regulations, be it our taxation laws, our",32
NA,environmental and safety standards and our labour market requirements. We are not losing,32
NA,control of these things by accepting foreign investment.,32
NA,"In terms of critical infrastructure, we know risks must be managed carefully, and we will",32
NA,have more to say on this in the near future. In those rare cases where substantial problems are,32
NA,"identified, the government will not hesitate to take appropriate action to safeguard Australia's",32
NA,national interests. This is why the Treasurer rejected the proposed acquisition of Ausgrid.,32
NA,But outright rejections are rare; we continue to welcome foreign investment in critical,32
NA,"infrastructure. For example, I was pleased to see a consortium comprising Australian and",32
NA,international investors participate in the Port of Melbourne lease.,32
NA,Investment in agricultural land is also a touchstone issue here. This is why we have,32
NA,tightened the FIRB screening thresholds for agricultural land and agribusiness and established,32
NA,an agricultural land ownership register to help provide some facts around levels of foreign,32
NA,ownership.,32
NA,It turns out that foreign investors held only 13.6 per cent of Australian agricultural land (as,32
NA,"at 30 June 2016), and the biggest investors in agricultural land are the United Kingdom and",32
NA,"the United States. China comes in fifth, holding only 0.4 per cent of Australia's agricultural",32
NA,land.,32
NA,But we need investment to build on the great potential of our agricultural and food sector,32
NA,and to maximise its capacity to take advantage of the growth opportunities throughout our,32
NA,region. ANZ has estimated we need additional investment of $1 trillion if we are to double,32
NA,our agricultural exports by 2050.,32
NA,We can look to examples of where there has been controversy and reflect on the results. At,32
NA,"96,000 hectares, about the size of Iceland, Cubbie Station is one of Queensland's most",32
NA,"significant agricultural land holdings. Less than five years ago, Chinese textile firm Shandong",32
NA,NA,32
NA,Ruyi lifted Cubbie out of five years of voluntary administration with an investment of $240,33
NA,"million. Today, it is hard to find a bad word about Cubbie Station or its foreign owner in",33
NA,"Dirranbandi. Despite all the initial concerns, Cubbie's operations have stayed local. It is the",33
NA,lifeblood of farmers and local businesses. It is reported that more locals than ever are working,33
NA,"on the crops, which will be worth more than $85 million when they ripen next April.",33
NA,It is not just those on the farm that benefit. Local businesses that might otherwise have,33
NA,suffered are benefiting from what is now a viable business at Cubbie. In the words of John,33
NA,"Travers, Manager of the local agricultural machinery and truck dealership, Vanderfield:",33
NA,Any concerns around the acquisition were quickly allayed because changes in the operations were,33
NA,unnoticeable. They remained loyal to their contractors and suppliers and recognised that we are part of,33
NA,the supply chain.,33
NA,"Foreign investment delivers not just jobs for those directly employed, but also practical,",33
NA,tangible benefits for many other Australians through the goods and services that are produced.,33
NA,The benefits of foreign investment can come in all sorts of different ways.,33
NA,"For instance, the entry of German discount supermarket Aldi has not only increased",33
NA,competition in Australia's supermarket sector. With plans to sell groceries and wine online to,33
NA,"China in the first half of 2017, to be followed by establishing stores there, its regional",33
NA,expansion is building Australian jobs and Australian exports.,33
NA,State and territory governments are also harnessing foreign investment. With assistance,33
NA,"from foreign money and capability, they are creating tens of thousands of jobs across the",33
NA,"country, while building the infrastructure we need to cut travel times and to get us to and from",33
NA,home even faster.,33
NA,Projects like the Sydney Metro Northwest will cut travel time from 90 to 35 minutes and,33
NA,reduce car trips by 14 million a year. It will be delivered with investment from Hong Kong,33
NA,company MTR. It means new jobs now and broader benefits for decades to come.,33
NA,"And let us not forget our tourism sector, which directly accounts for one in every 20",33
NA,"Australian jobs. It is of particular importance to the regions, where 45 cents in every tourism",33
NA,"dollar is spent. In my constituency alone, tourism directly employed some 30,400 people,",33
NA,"with another 20,000 indirect jobs, and contributed some $4.9 billion to the Gold Coast",33
NA,economy in 2013-14. But major investment in tourism is needed if we are to sustain this and,33
NA,fully benefit from the higher demand predicted to flow from the growth of Asia's middle,33
NA,"class, from 600 million to three billion by 2030.",33
NA,"Our hotels, resorts and tourist attractions need upgrading with new investment. The",33
NA,Sheraton Mirage Port Douglas Resort was relaunched in August this year following an,33
NA,extensive $43 million refurbishment of the resort's 294 guest rooms and their public spaces by,33
NA,"Chinese company Fullshare Industrial Holding Group. Here again, foreign investment is",33
NA,"helping to make Australia globally competitive, continuing a pattern of successive waves of",33
NA,foreign investment. We saw significant Japanese investment in Queensland hotels and resorts,33
NA,in the 1980s. Many of these assets eventually ended up in local hands. Sources of capital may,33
NA,change but the resulting infrastructure endures.,33
NA,"Today we welcome investment in tourism from new sources. TFE Hotels, established in",33
NA,"2013, is a joint venture between Australia's Toga Group and Singapore's Far East Hospitality",33
NA,"Holdings. Operating 70 hotels nationally, with brands like Medina, Travelodge and Vibe, its",33
NA,NA,33
NA,presence sprawls across Australia opening doors to tourism in northern cities such as Darwin,34
NA,and Rockhampton.,34
NA,Conclusion,34
NA,"We are a proud and capable country. We have world-leading ideas, technology, and skills.",34
NA,We are embracing the challenges the global economy presents. Investment is a crucial,34
NA,element in our strategy to retain and create new jobs and economic opportunities-to,34
NA,"safeguard what we have now and what we want for the future, and to project our capability",34
NA,into the world.,34
NA,"The right investment will support substantial and enduring jobs, sustain our businesses and",34
NA,"local communities, build on our strengths and our potential. That is why as the Minister for",34
NA,"Trade, Tourism and Investment I will continue to welcome foreign investment here at home",34
NA,and be at the forefront of efforts to maintain Australia's openness abroad.,34
Dr LEIGH ,"Fenner) (10:22): I rise representing the member for Blaxland, who is Labor's",34
NA,shadow minister for trade and investment and is presently on parental leave. At the outset I,34
NA,note that the opposition were not provided in advance with a copy of the statement or the,34
NA,"document that the minister has tabled, so my comments will be of a general nature responding",34
NA,to the minister's speech and discussing the coalition's role in the fall in Australian investment,34
NA,that we have seen over recent years.,34
NA,Labor acknowledges the benefits to Australia of foreign investment. As Senator Wong,34
NA,recently noted:,34
NA,"Last year Australians saved just over $363 billion, yet investment in our economy was nearly $425",34
NA,"billion. This was, of course, nothing out of the ordinary.",34
NA,"Over the last four decades, the gap between Australia's national savings and investment has averaged",34
NA,around 4 per cent of GDP.,34
NA,By tapping into foreign investment Australia is using the savings of other nations in order to,34
NA,finance investment in our own country. Foreign investment ensures that we enjoy higher,34
NA,living standards and that we have a more productive economy and more sustainable,34
NA,"industries. To do away with foreign investment would be to see employment decrease, wages",34
NA,"fall, prices rise and the choices offered to consumers decrease.",34
NA,"As the shadow minister for trade and investment, Jason Clare, has noted:",34
NA,Asia is the key to Australia's success in the years ahead. There'll be three billion middle class consumers,34
NA,north of us by 2030 and the key for Australia is making sure that we sell our products and our services,34
NA,to Asia-that we get our fair share of that market.,34
NA,The member for Blaxland has noted Labor's strong history of support for open markets.,34
NA,"As the minister has noted, the statistics on inbound investment are concerning. An OECD",34
NA,report brought down in April this year noted that foreign direct investment flows to Australia,34
NA,"fell by A$23 billion, or 44 per cent, last year. That came despite inbound FDI inflows across",34
NA,the OECD's 34 member nations almost doubling in 2015. And it followed disappointing,34
NA,"investment results for Australia in 2014, when foreign direct investment inflows declined by",34
NA,30 per cent. So under the coalition in recent years we have seen a decline in Australia's,34
NA,inbound investment. I will return later in my remarks to the role that coalition policies may,34
NA,have played in that fall.,34
NA,NA,34
NA,But it is important to put on record the role that foreign investment has played in the,35
NA,development of the Australian economy. In 1855 CSR's investment helped to shape our sugar,35
NA,industry. In 1877 we saw the United States firm Schweppes set up in Australia. In the 1920s,35
NA,"we saw Kraft and Kellogg investing in Australia and, as David Uren points out in his terrific",35
NA,"book on foreign investment, one of the great ironies is that Vegemite may never have become",35
NA,the global success story that it is without foreign investment from Kraft.,35
NA,"Foreign investment in our beef industry from Britain, the United States and Japan has been",35
NA,"critical in developing that industry. Investors like the controversial Vestey family,",35
NA,"International Ranchers and King Ranch, from Texas, have been important in our beef",35
NA,"industry. Kodak set up here in 1908, Coca-Cola and Heinz in the 1930s and of course there is",35
NA,"automotive foreign investment. The foreign investment in Australia by automotive firms,",35
NA,"including General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Leyland, Toyota and Nissan, were important in",35
NA,creating well-paying Australian jobs. And the role of this government in goading Holden to,35
NA,"leave has had a damaging effect, particularly on the South Australian economy. The",35
NA,withdrawal of foreign investment is one of the chief challenges that South Australia faces at,35
NA,the moment.,35
NA,Foreign investment has also been important in the media industry. I often have to chuckle,35
NA,when I see stories in tabloids railing against foreign investment. Without foreign investment,35
NA,from companies such as News Limited there would be fewer Australian journalists employed,35
NA,in Australia.,35
NA,Labor's support for foreign investment is longstanding and is of a piece with Labor's,35
NA,support for a strong immigration system and for the benefits of a global trading system. Those,35
NA,on the other side of the House have a track record which has not always been strongly in,35
NA,favour of foreign investment. Black Jack MCEwen-John MCEwen-once said:,35
NA,It is not good enough for this country to live by selling a bit of its heritage every year. We do not,35
NA,want to see Australia have its industries unduly owned in foreign hands.,35
NA,"Prime Minister John Gorton, travelling in Britain, once said:",35
NA,… it has seemed to me that the posture of Australia in seeking overseas capital has been the posture of a,35
NA,"puppy lying on its back with all legs in the air and its stomach exposed saying please, please, please",35
NA,"give us capital. Oh, tickle my tummy. On any conditions.",35
NA,"While MCEwen and Gorton are long gone, their heirs are still here in this parliament in those",35
NA,who would prefer to fear-monger over foreign investment rather than acknowledge its,35
NA,benefits.,35
NA,"On this side of the House, Labor has been strong in arguing for economic openness. As",35
NA,"David Uren has noted, 'Labor has staked an even more liberal position than that espoused by",35
NA,the Liberals.' That was starkly on display when Archer Daniel Midlands made their bid for,35
NA,"GrainCorp-a bid that those of us on this side of the House said, based on the publicly-",35
NA,"available information, should have been broadly supported. But it was ultimately blocked by",35
NA,"coalition Treasurer Hockey, making it the first major United States foreign investment bid to",35
NA,have been blocked.,35
NA,The coalition has also introduced significant amounts of red tape around Australia's foreign,35
NA,investment. Senator Wong has pointed out that when it came to the Foreign Acquisitions and,35
NA,Takeovers Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 the exposure draft and regulations accounted for,35
NA,NA,35
NA,more than 170 pages and were accompanied by a 105-page explanatory guide. As one of the,36
NA,former Minister for Trade's own investments specialists pointed out:,36
NA,… the new fees have fuelled the narrative around Australia being a high-cost destination to invest in.,36
NA,What did the Office of Best Practice Regulation have to say about this?,36
NA,They admitted that this new red tape burden was being imposed last year without proper,36
NA,assessment and with the increased regulatory burden.,36
NA,"Under the government's proposals, we have 22 different screening thresholds and",36
NA,"categories, which vary depending on the value and type of investment, and the nationality of",36
NA,"the investor. When it comes to application fees, there are 33 different levels and categories of",36
NA,"application fees, ranging from $5,000 to $100,000-a twentyfold difference in application",36
NA,"fees. To take one straightforward example, we can look at the screening threshold differences",36
NA,"for investments in agricultural land. For investment that comes from Chile, New Zealand and",36
NA,"the United States, the screening threshold is $1,094 million; for investments from Singapore",36
NA,and Thailand-but with the caveat that the land is used wholly or exclusively for a primary,36
NA,production business-the screening threshold is $50 million. For investment in agricultural,36
NA,"land coming from other countries, the screening threshold is $15 million.",36
NA,These differential screening thresholds have raised concerns among many. When the,36
NA,"government's Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Legislation Amendment Bill was released,",36
NA,"it was criticised by the Business Council of Australia, the National Farmers' Federation, the",36
NA,"Food and Grocery Council, the Queensland Farmers' Federation and the Chamber of",36
NA,Commerce and Industry of Western Australia. As the Business of Council of Australia noted:,36
NA,"The government has declared that it is 'open for business', however its recent decisions have sent the",36
NA,opposite message to potential international investors considering investing in the Australian agrifood,36
NA,sector.,36
NA,"Those of us on this side of the House have no objections to new investment awards, but no-",36
NA,"one is giving this government a gold medal for its investment policy, which has",36
NA,discriminatory screening thresholds applied inconsistently.,36
NA,"We should note, too, that the government's approach to foreign investment in agricultural",36
NA,land has been ad hoc. The minister correctly noted that agriculture is a very small share of all,36
NA,"foreign direct investment into Australia. As at the end of 2014, foreign direct investments into",36
NA,agriculture were just $1.3 billion out of a total of $688 billion of foreign direct investment-,36
NA,"that is just 0.2 per cent of all foreign direct investment. By comparison, mining accounted for",36
NA,39 per cent and manufacturing for 13 per cent.,36
NA,"But concerns have been stoked over foreign investment into Australian agricultural land,",36
NA,"chiefly by the member for New England who is, if anyone is, the heir to 'Black Jack' MCEwen",36
NA,in this chamber today. The minister promised that there would be a public register which,36
NA,would allow members of the public to see the location and size of agricultural properties with,36
NA,foreign ownership. He said it would be like a map of all properties 'to see who owns what'.,36
NA,"Now the member for New England has changed his tune, saying that only the aggregated data",36
NA,"for the new registry will be made public. To the extent that we have those data, the Australian",36
NA,Bureau of Statistics' Agricultural Land and Water Ownership Survey showed that 99 per cent,36
NA,"of Australian farm businesses were fully Australian owned in 2013, that 88 per cent of",36
NA,farmland by area was Australian owned and that a further five per cent was majority,36
NA,NA,36
NA,"Australian owned. This stands in contrast with the corporate sector, where Australian",37
NA,financial corporations are nearly 55 per cent foreign owned and non-financial corporations are,37
NA,"over 40 per cent foreign owned. To take one example of a large multinational, the big",37
NA,Australian-BHP-has the majority of its shareholders overseas.,37
NA,"The debate over foreign ownership of agricultural land needs to be grounded in facts, not",37
NA,"fear. Labor supports an evidence based approach to this issue, but we are concerned when the",37
NA,"member for New England seeks to make political capital from this issue. Indeed, his",37
NA,comments stand starkly in contrast to the more sober and considered statements from the,37
NA,minister in the chamber today.,37
NA,"At the last election, Labor took a policy to the Australian electorate pledging to make",37
NA,Australia a more attractive destination for investors and to support jobs by liberalising,37
NA,screening thresholds for the farm and food sectors. We pledged that Labor would increase the,37
NA,"screening threshold for investment in agricultural land to $50 million, non-cumulative,",37
NA,bringing all investors into line with the agricultural land threshold under the Howard,37
NA,government's trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand. We said that we would remove,37
NA,"the agribusiness screening category, a reform that would put agribusiness on the same footing",37
NA,as other investors. We said that we would review the current system's discriminatory,37
NA,"treatment of investments in non-sensitive sectors by investors from Singapore, Thailand and",37
NA,"non-free trade agreement trading partners, as well as the treatment of agricultural land under",37
NA,the Foreign Investment Review Board's framework.,37
NA,"Labor supports the role of the Foreign Investment Review Board, established in 1972 in",37
NA,"response to the then horrifying prospect that the Chiko Roll might be sold off to foreigners,",37
NA,but we do see it as important that our foreign investment screening process has more,37
NA,"consistency to it, that it does not have discriminatory screening thresholds based on",37
NA,nationality.,37
NA,"In the few minutes remaining to me, I cannot but respond to the minister's comments on",37
NA,"company tax. It seems that, whatever the problem is that Australia faces, this government's",37
NA,"response is to cut the company tax rate. As the member for Blaxland noted over the weekend,",37
NA,"if you asked them what their solution was to the current woes of the Australian cricket team,",37
NA,"they would probably say, 'Let's bring down the company tax rate.' But we have to compare",37
NA,our Australian company tax rate with the company tax rate in the largest economies of the,37
NA,"world. In the United States, the corporate tax rate is 35 per cent. In Germany, the European",37
NA,"Union's powerhouse, it is 29.65 per cent. In the top 10 economies in the world, the average",37
NA,corporate tax rate is 29 per cent. Here in Australia it is 28½ per cent for small businesses and,37
NA,"30 per cent for larger businesses. So, even without considering imputation, the corporate tax",37
NA,rate in Australia is comparable to the corporate tax rate in the largest economies in the world.,37
NA,"Yes, there have been suggestions that, under President-elect Trump, the United States",37
NA,might cut its corporate tax rate. But does Australia really want to be going down the road of,37
NA,"Trumponomics? Do we really want to get into the prospect of following a tax plan which,",37
NA,"according to independent experts, could add between $5 trillion and $10 trillion to debt in the",37
NA,United States?,37
NA,Here in Australia we have had debt rising rapidly under the coalition. Since the coalition,37
NA,"won office, debt has risen by over $100 billion-more than $5,000 for every man, woman and",37
NA,child in Australia. The rate of increase in Australia's debt has been more rapid under the,37
NA,NA,37
NA,Abbott-Turnbull governments than it was under the Rudd and Gillard governments. Under the,38
NA,"Rudd and Gillard governments, Australian debt rose on average by $4.5 billion per month. Of",38
NA,"course, that debt was taken on largely in order to address the global financial crisis, the largest",38
NA,downturn since the Great Depression. Every serious commentator accepted that Australia had,38
NA,"to take on debt, because after all we were only left with razor-thin surpluses from the Howard",38
NA,years. All serious commentators-and I think it was even accepted by sensible people in the,38
NA,coalition at the time-knew that Australia needed to take on debt to deal with the global,38
NA,financial crisis.,38
NA,"But, since the coalition has taken over office, in a period in which we did not have a global",38
NA,"financial crisis, debt has risen at a rate of $4.9 billion per month. That is right: the rate of",38
NA,increase in Australia's debt has been more rapid under the Abbott-Turnbull governments with,38
NA,no global financial crisis than it was under Labor with a global financial crisis. So now is,38
NA,"surely not the time to talk about a massive corporate tax giveaway, a $50 billion corporate tax",38
NA,"cut, at a time when Australia's headline company tax rate is in line with the largest 10",38
NA,economies in the world.,38
NA,"Of course, no serious conversation about company tax can proceed with acknowledging",38
NA,"that we have dividend imputation, a system shared only with New Zealand in the OECD,",38
NA,which ensures that we give about a third of the company tax revenue back through the,38
NA,personal income tax system. A 30 per cent company tax rate with imputation raises about as,38
NA,"much revenue as a 20 per cent company tax rate without imputation. So, from a fiscal",38
NA,"perspective, Australia's headline corporation tax rate for large companies of 30 per cent ought",38
NA,to be compared to other countries that have a 20 per cent tax rate without imputation. This,38
NA,point is often either ignored or deliberately left off the table when people are comparing,38
NA,company tax rates. But to do so is deeply misleading and ignores the impact on the Australian,38
NA,budget.,38
NA,"So, in conclusion, Labor concurs with the coalition about the value of foreign investment in",38
NA,"creating jobs, raising productivity, ensuring that we have more competition and lower prices.",38
NA,But we do believe that the coalition has presided over a fall in inbound investment and that,38
NA,that fall in inbound investment can be traced in part to the hodgepodge of restrictive rules that,38
NA,"have been placed around foreign investment, to the discriminatory screening thresholds and to",38
NA,this government's willingness to play footsy with the extremists who want to scaremonger,38
NA,over a foreign investment.,38
NA,"The debate over foreign investment needs to be conducted soberly and sensibly,",38
NA,"recognising its historic benefits to Australia and recognising that, through a sensible system of",38
NA,"screening under the Foreign Investment Review Board, foreign investment can be of benefit",38
NA,to the Australian economy over the long run.,38

Mr BANDT ,"Melbourne) (10:42): Right now, young people are getting screwed. Year",39
NA,"after year, successive Labor and Liberal governments have been making life harder for young",39
NA,"people. They have managed the economy in the interests of the few, instead of in the interests",39
NA,"of everyone. And it is getting harder and harder for young people to get a job, as youth",39
NA,"unemployment is high, and it has doubled over the general unemployment rate. The jobs that",39
NA,young people often do get are very highly insecure and often not well paid at all.,39
NA,"Study is getting less and less affordable, because university and TAFE are getting more",39
NA,"expensive. The dream of owning your own home is getting further and further out of reach,",39
NA,with Australian house prices skyrocketing and incomes stagnant. Yet the government is not,39
NA,"doing anything about this. In fact, if the government has its way the problem for young people",39
NA,"will get much, much worse. If right now young people are getting screwed, if the government",39
NA,gets its plans through they will be right royally stuffed.,39
NA,Let's have a look at the current situation. Youth unemployment is at nearly 13 per cent.,39
NA,That is more than double the general national rate. An Anglicare report that was recently,39
NA,"released found that only one job is advertised for every six low-skilled jobseekers, who are",39
NA,often young people who have not had the opportunity to gain much work experience. Getting,39
NA,a job can be even harder for people living in a regional area or for people from non-English,39
NA,speaking backgrounds. Young people in Melbourne have told me that if they put 'Mohammed',39
NA,"in their CV and they send off their job application, they hear nothing; but when they change",39
NA,"their name to 'David', the phone starts ringing.",39
NA,"And increasingly there are fewer entry level jobs available for young people, making it",39
NA,"harder for young people to get their foot in the door, to build their skills and experience, to",39
NA,"establish a career, to gain independence, and to plan and progress their lives. The youth",39
NA,NA,39
NA,"unemployment rate is always higher than the general unemployment rate, and in some",40
NA,"respects that makes sense; young people are, as a whole, doing other things, whereas older",40
NA,people tend to be more likely to look for work.,40
NA,"What we also know, as a general historical trend, is that every time there is an economic",40
NA,"downturn, we strike hard times or there is a recession young people are hardest hit first. The",40
NA,lines of the youth unemployment rate and the general unemployment rate diverge when we,40
NA,"reach hard times, and it becomes proportionately harder for young people to find work. The",40
NA,youth unemployment rate for them skyrockets. What we have also found historically over,40
NA,"Australia's history is that those two lines, after a year or so, tend to converge again and it",40
NA,becomes easier for young people to find work. Since the GFC that has not happened in,40
NA,Australia. For young people the line has stayed higher. Since the GFC it has become harder,40
NA,proportionately than at any other time in history for young people to get back into work. The,40
NA,entry-level jobs since the GFC are disappearing. Those jobs that you might walk into straight,40
NA,out of school or that you might walk into if you do not finish school are disappearing. The,40
NA,jobs that this government wants young people to get just are not being created any more in the,40
NA,"way that they used to, and it is a national crisis.",40
NA,So what is this government's response? Rather than listening to expert advice on how to,40
NA,tackle youth unemployment or invest in new industries that might create those jobs for the,40
NA,"future, the Liberals have taken it upon themselves to be every young Australian's tough",40
NA,"parent, serving up some tough love by telling them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps",40
NA,"and earn or learn. Their first plan was to kick young people off Newstart, which is itself so",40
NA,"low that it is below the poverty line and is a barrier to people finding work, because you do",40
NA,"not have that money to invest in yourself-to get some training, to buy the new clothes for the",40
NA,"job interview, to even get a haircut. Their first plan was to kick people off Newstart and make",40
NA,them wait six weeks before they can receive this measly payment to try and support,40
NA,"themselves. Luckily, the Senate took a stand for young people and refused to pass this",40
NA,"ridiculous measure. Yet, the Liberals are refusing to listen, saying they only want to make",40
NA,"young people wait four weeks before they can get Newstart. Well, four weeks-the landlord",40
NA,"does not care that you do not have money coming from the government to pay the rent, the",40
NA,public transport does not care that you do not have money because it is the government's fault.,40
NA,"But the government's approach is still to say, 'Well, we'll deal with the national youth",40
NA,unemployment crisis by making life tougher for young people.',40
NA,"At the same time the government wants to make learning more expensive, less accessible",40
NA,and more exclusive by cutting support for students and deregulating our universities-a move,40
NA,"that experts have warned could see the creation of US-style $100,000 degrees. So it is harder",40
NA,"to earn by getting a job because, under this government and since the GFC, the jobs are not",40
NA,"there in the same way, it is more expensive to try and learn, and even if you are lucky enough",40
NA,"to get a job and to keep it and to earn an income, owning your home is becoming a",40
NA,pipedream.,40
NA,In 1990 house prices were approximately six times a young person's income. In 2013 that,40
NA,had doubled to approximately 12 times a young person's income. It is not the fault of smashed,40
NA,avocados that housing is becoming increasingly unaffordable for people. Even if you find a,40
NA,job and even if you find a secure job-which is pretty tough to do these days-the ratio of,40
NA,your income to house prices is just skyrocketing. And that has happened under the watch of,40
NA,NA,40
NA,Liberal and Labor. The old parties' policies of allowing negative gearing to happen and the,41
NA,"capital gains tax discount to continue turned housing into an unproductive investment class,",41
NA,"and it caused an explosion in house prices, meaning that overwhelmingly the only people who",41
NA,could afford to buy a house are those who already have one.,41
NA,The government should be making it easier for people to buy their first home not helping,41
NA,"people who already have one to buy their second, third or fourth. The Grattan Institute found",41
NA,that under these and other government policies real wealth held by older households from,41
NA,"2003 through to 2012 grew by $215,000, but for younger households it went backwards. In",41
NA,"1994 young households had nearly 10 percent of the country's wealth, but by 2014 that had",41
NA,effectively halved to 5.5 per cent. So over 20 years young people went from having 10 per,41
NA,cent of the country's wealth to having about five per cent. At the same time it dramatically,41
NA,increased for older generations. This is why young people are getting screwed: successive,41
NA,"governments have worked against them, dealing them an increasingly bad hand and growing",41
NA,intergenerational inequality. Governments have allowed the economy to run rampant and to,41
NA,screw young people.,41
NA,The good news is that as a society we are becoming more and more aware of just how,41
NA,"much young people are getting screwed. Academics, think tanks and civil society",41
NA,organisations are all pointing out how the odds are no longer in young people's favour and,41
NA,"how, under Liberal and Labor, we may be creating a situation where we are leaving the",41
NA,economy and household budgets and the planet worse off for generations that come after us,41
NA,rather than better. But the bad news is that the government are refusing to look at the bigger,41
NA,picture and are refusing to listen. They are being the unreasonable parent instead of listening,41
NA,"to their children or experts, having blind faith that they know what is best-that is, to make",41
NA,"people work for either nothing or next to nothing. If it were a lesson on safe sex, this is a",41
NA,government that would be pushing abstinence not condoms. If it were a lesson on good,41
NA,"behaviour, this is a government that would be sending young people to their rooms rather than",41
NA,talking the issue through.,41
NA,Instead of working systematically to even the odds and deliver a better deal for young,41
NA,"people, on budget night this year the Liberals unveiled their master plan for getting young",41
NA,"people a job-this Prepare, Trial, Hire scheme. What it really meant, though, was that earn or",41
NA,"learn became burn and churn. Essentially, this government's plan to tackle high youth",41
NA,unemployment and help young people get a job is to lure them to work for below the,41
NA,minimum wage. The Liberals' plan will not provide secure and meaningful work for the,41
NA,hundreds of thousands of young people who are unemployed. What will do is drive down,41
NA,"wages for other workers and see employers burn and churn through young people. In fact, it",41
NA,could see people currently working in these roles kicked out in favour of free money and,41
NA,"labour, courtesy of the government. Under the program being enabled by this bill, by not",41
NA,having to hire someone at the usual wage employers could bank more per week than the,41
NA,"young people who are supposedly going to get a job. In other words, this scheme will allow",41
NA,"employers, on the public purse, to take home more money than the young people who are",41
NA,going to be forced to work under it. The Greens do not accept that to get young people into,41
NA,"work they need to be paid as little as $4 an hour, which is well below the minimum wage.",41
NA,That is what this scheme is about.,41
NA,NA,41
NA,"Following the government's unveiling of this flagship program, the Secretary of the",42
NA,Australian Council of Trade Unions said 'this internship program is a path to nowhere' and,42
NA,"'gives business access to free, exploitable workers'. He asked:",42
NA,Why would a business employ a minimum wage or lower paid worker when the government is ready to,42
NA,supply them with free labour and a $1000 handout?,42
NA,He pointed out that these internships could include low-skilled work such as work in,42
NA,"supermarkets, which is not a plan to create real, lasting jobs. It is simply substituting existing",42
NA,"low-paid labour with even cheaper, government subsidised labour rather than creating new",42
NA,jobs.,42
NA,"Let us be clear about this: internships, if they are structured correctly, can be a good thing.",42
NA,They can provide opportunities for young people to learn and build their skills. We have had,42
NA,"internships for a very long time. Every political party in this place, I am sure, offers",42
NA,internships. Community groups offer internships. Organisations like community groups and,42
NA,"political parties thrive on getting young people involved, but when we do it-and I speak here",42
NA,on behalf of the Greens-we do not offer out hope to people that this is some pathway to,42
NA,secure employment; it is about you and increasing your skills. You are not here doing,42
NA,government subsidised work where you are required to turn up at a particular time and clock,42
NA,off at a particular time. It is not a false job-because that is not what an internship is or should,42
NA,"be. But when you ask people, as the government is doing under this program, to clock on and",42
NA,"clock off and get the equivalent of $4 an hour while they hold out hope of a secure job, and",42
NA,"you pay employers $1,000 from the public purse to put them on and displace other workers,",42
NA,that is not a scheme to create lasting employment.,42
NA,The simple fact is this: this is a flawed plan dreamt up in isolation by a government that,42
NA,"thinks it knows best, but it will not help people find secure long-term work. In fact, it could",42
NA,just see handouts to business to force young people to work for below the minimum wage and,42
NA,potentially force people from a job who are currently working in these roles. There is nothing,42
NA,in this bill that provides protection for someone currently working in a low-paid job from,42
NA,being forced out of that job by this new scheme so that government subsidised cheap labour,42
NA,can come in instead.,42
NA,We have to take action to help make life easier for young people. That means tackling,42
NA,"rising job insecurity and tackling housing unaffordability, but this program will not do that. If",42
NA,"we were serious, we would be investing in education. We would be investing in big job-",42
NA,creating projects that will provide secure work for young people-like public transport and,42
NA,clean energy. We would be making it easier for people to get into education and complete it,42
NA,and we would end the unfair tax breaks that are pushing up the cost of housing and pricing,42
NA,young people out of the market. And we have to do it now because otherwise we run the risk,42
NA,of locking an entire generation out of secure work and locking an entire generation out of,42
NA,owning their own home.,42
Ms HENDERSON ,Corangamite) (10:56): It is my great pleasure to rise and speak on the,42
NA,"Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016.",42
NA,This bill gives effect to the Youth Jobs PaTH measure announced in the 2016-17 budget as,42
NA,"part of our youth employment package. Very proudly, our government announced this very",42
NA,significant package-an $840 million package to tackle youth unemployment in our country.,42
NA,NA,42
NA,"That is in contrast to members opposite, from whom we saw no national initiatives to combat",43
NA,what we recognise is a very significant issue across our nation.,43
NA,The Youth Jobs PaTH program is aimed at maximising the chance of young jobseekers,43
NA,"obtaining a job and moving off income support. It will do this in a number of ways, through a",43
NA,"very significant investment of three-quarters of a billion dollars, and help some 120,000",43
NA,"people over four years. It will do that by getting up to 30,000 eligible young jobseekers per",43
NA,year ready. It will prepare them and provide them with employability skills training from 1,43
NA,April 2017. It will give young people a go while trialling them by providing an internship,43
NA,supported by a youth bonus wage subsidy.,43

Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (10:58): by leave-I returned yesterday,43
NA,from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders summit in Peru. While APEC is a,43
NA,"meeting where issues of trade and economic integration dominate, all of the leaders of",43
NA,"economies great and small understand the threat that terrorism poses to our security and,",43
NA,"indeed, to the relative peace in our region, which has itself been the foundation for the",43
NA,economic growth on which our futures and those of our children depend.,43
NA,"In discussions with the leaders of the United States, China, Canada, Malaysia, the",43
NA,"Philippines, Japan and others, cooperation on counterterrorism was a focus of attention.",43
NA,Few places in the world are unaffected by terrorism-whether it is returning foreign,43
NA,fighters or home-grown terrorists.,43
NA,Today I assure the House and the Australian people of my government's steadfast,43
NA,"commitment to ensuring Australians remain safe, secure and free.",43
NA,Australia's starting point is a stronger foundation than most other nations.,43
NA,"Our strengths are our freedom, our diversity, our security.",43
NA,These attributes are not mutually exclusive; rather they are mutually reinforcing.,43
NA,Security is a prerequisite to the trust and confidence that allows a diverse and free society,43
NA,to flourish.,43
NA,But we do face real challenges. And we must be open to them and learn lessons from,43
NA,events at home and abroad in order to deal with them.,43
NA,We must be clear-eyed and hard-headed as we assess the evolving threat.,43
NA,There is no bliss in ignorance and no comfort in complacency.,43
NA,"Recent terror attacks in Nice, Baghdad, Brussels, Quetta, Orlando, Kabul, Jakarta and",43
NA,elsewhere remind us that terrorism is a global challenge that affects us all.,43
NA,That is why a critical part of our strategy is to engage internationally and to contribute to,43
NA,global counterterrorism efforts.,43
NA,NA,43
NA,Nowhere is this engagement more important than in South-East Asia.,44
NA,This region and its people are part of the fabric that shapes and defines the Australian,44
NA,community and our national identity. But the rising influence in our region of terrorist,44
NA,"organisations, such as ISIL or Daesh, demands the attention and the action of Australia and its",44
NA,neighbours.,44
NA,"Daesh's insidious influence was demonstrated by terrorist attacks in Jakarta on 14 January,",44
NA,and again in the attack on Indonesian police on the outskirts of Jakarta on 20 October.,44
NA,"As I told the House in my counterterrorism update on 1 September, the next mass-casualty",44
NA,"attack on Australian victims could be somewhere in South-East Asia, where Daesh",44
NA,"propaganda has galvanised existing networks of extremists, preyed on vulnerable young",44
NA,people and attracted new recruits.,44
NA,"In response, my government, alongside key partners in our region, is at the forefront of",44
NA,regional efforts to combat terrorism and counter the destructive narratives of violent Islamic,44
NA,extremism.,44
NA,No one country can fight terrorism on its own.,44
NA,"And over the past decade, we have built closer diplomatic and security relationships with",44
NA,"our neighbours, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.",44
NA,It is in this context that we continue to contribute to the global fight against Daesh and,44
NA,other terrorist organisations.,44
NA,Daesh's control of territory and resources in Iraq and Syria boost its ability to promote,44
NA,virulently anti-Western ideology and inspire terrorist attacks internationally.,44
NA,"Only last week we saw Daesh's latest propaganda, which used footage of Australian",44
NA,locations and Australian icons in a call for further attacks against the West.,44
NA,Daesh will continue doing this in an attempt to intimidate us.,44
NA,But they will not succeed.,44
NA,My government and our agencies are committed to decisive action to combat and defeat,44
NA,Daesh through the United States-led coalition in the Middle East.,44
NA,"In this fight, as with virtually every other significant security challenge facing our country,",44
NA,our alliance with the United States is the foundation of our national security architecture.,44
NA,Australia's trusted solidarity with the United States is based on mutual respect-we and we,44
NA,alone determine whether and how our forces are put in harm's way-but the closeness of our,44
NA,relationship ensures that no ally has more influence than we do.,44
NA,That influence is one which is highly valued now and in the future as President Obama,44
NA,reminded us in Lima on Sunday.,44
NA,Those who assert that our ties and our alliance with the United States should be,44
NA,"reconsidered fail to recognise that a strong, trusted, forthright Australia is a powerful force for",44
NA,good whether it is on the fields of conflict or in the corridors of power in Washington.,44
NA,The fact is that the United States remains our most important strategic and defence ally.,44
NA,This was on display only last week when I took part in the first Australian flight of the new,44
NA,P-8A Poseidon aircraft-developed between Australia and the United States Navy.,44
NA,NA,44
NA,"And in relation to counterterrorism cooperation, our collaborative screening of refugees",45
NA,from the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts has identified 22 persons of national security concern.,45
NA,"Right now, Iraqi defence forces, including units trained by the Australian Army, are",45
NA,making real progress in the liberation of Mosul from Daesh.,45
NA,"The contribution of the ADF to the defence of Iraq, working with the United States and",45
NA,"other coalition forces, has been critically important-as has been acknowledged by President",45
NA,Obama and indeed by the Prime Minister of Iraq itself.,45
NA,"Daesh is under increasing pressure. It is losing territory, finance and fighters.",45
NA,Its so-called caliphate and its illusion of invincibility are being shattered.,45
NA,"But as Daesh loses ground, many hundreds of foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq may seek",45
NA,"to return to their countries of origin, including in our region-especially Indonesia, Malaysia,",45
NA,the Philippines as well as Australia itself.,45
NA,Our law enforcement and security agencies have long been prepared for this challenge and,45
NA,are constantly monitoring for any shift in the threat environment ahead.,45
NA,"Indeed, we have seen in recent weeks three individuals charged with foreign incursion",45
NA,offences.,45
NA,These latest arrests bring to 55 the number of people charged from 24 counterterrorism,45
NA,operations around Australia since September 2014. The acts of terror we have witnessed,45
NA,demonstrate that the international security environment has flow-on effects for Australia's,45
NA,domestic threat environment.,45
NA,The Director-General of Security has informed me that he has reviewed the National,45
NA,Terrorism Threat Level and that it remains unchanged at probable.,45
NA,"We have been at this elevated level of threat since September 2014, in which time we have",45
NA,experienced four attacks and 11 successful major disruptions.,45
NA,"And despite Daesh's heavy territorial losses in Iraq and Syria, we do not expect this threat",45
NA,"to diminish for some time. If anything, the threat has become more dispersed and new",45
NA,challenges are emerging.,45
NA,Increasingly widespread use of encrypted communication platforms makes the detection,45
NA,and interception of terrorist communications far more difficult.,45
NA,"Human intelligence, and the strong relationships and trust on which it depends, are more",45
NA,important than ever.,45
NA,"Around the world, the increase of attacks by lone actors, who are by their very nature so",45
NA,"much harder to detect, presents new challenges for disruption and deterrence by our security",45
NA,and law enforcement agencies.,45
NA,The truck attack in Nice highlighted just how devastating an attack by a single perpetrator,45
NA,can be.,45
NA,"To ensure Australia is best placed to respond to the evolving global threat environment,",45
NA,"and immediately following the Nice attack, in July I requested the Commonwealth's Counter-",45
NA,Terrorism Coordinator to review the lessons from recent terrorist attacks overseas and,45
NA,specifically the threat from lone actors.,45
NA,NA,45
NA,"While the full review will remain classified, I am pleased to be able to report it found",46
NA,"Australia already has robust legislative, policy and operational arrangements in place to",46
NA,"protect us from those threats. However, it also identified some areas requiring further work.",46
NA,A key finding was the need to continue working on how to best protect public places.,46
NA,"I can confirm that in response to the review, we have committed, as a priority, to develop a",46
NA,"national strategy for places of mass gathering, including a nationally consistent approach to",46
NA,risk assessment for such places.,46
NA,The review also confirmed there are a diverse range of factors that could make someone,46
NA,"vulnerable to radicalisation, from mental health issues to a history of criminality.",46
NA,The review found that such factors might increase the vulnerability of lone actors to the,46
NA,propaganda of terrorist organisations offering them some perverse sense of inclusion.,46
NA,"So we need to better support our frontline professionals including health professionals, to",46
NA,respond to Australians who may be at risk of radicalising towards violent extremism.,46
NA,"I have therefore asked our agencies, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Health and",46
NA,Ageing and the minister assisting me on counterterrorism to work with the states and,46
NA,"territories, peak bodies, international partners and the community to identify what more can",46
NA,"be done in this area to help both carers and patients, taking great care we do not stigmatise",46
NA,some of the most vulnerable people in our communities.,46
NA,"In relation to the nexus between criminality and terrorism, a pilot of the National Criminal",46
NA,Intelligence System now underway in the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission will,46
NA,allow us to better understand this correlation and identify threats.,46
NA,It is clear from the review that our international partners face very similar challenges.,46
NA,One of the key issues some international partners are addressing is the role played by their,46
NA,defence forces in domestic counterterrorism arrangements.,46
NA,"In Australia, a review is already underway to examine the support Defence provides to",46
NA,"domestic counterterrorism operations, looking at both the legislative framework and the",46
NA,Australian Defence Force posture and capability in view of the current threat environment.,46
NA,"The evolution of terrorism since 9/11, the adaptability of terrorist groups like Daesh and",46
NA,the insidious allure this group has held for too many often very young and vulnerable,46
NA,"Australians, should put each and every one of us in this House in no doubt that to defeat them",46
NA,we also must adapt.,46
NA,And it has been the coalition government that has acted proactively to the challenge of the,46
NA,threat posed by Daesh.,46
NA,We have increased our counterterrorism funding by $1.5 billion since September 2014.,46
NA,Our counterterrorism laws are designed to be the most robust and proportionate response,46
NA,possible in the current threat environment.,46
NA,The government has shown it is willing and agile enough to amend these laws to,46
NA,sufficiently empower those agencies that are responsible for keeping us safe.,46
NA,In the past year alone we have introduced three vitally important bills.,46
NA,NA,46
NA,The amendments to the Commonwealth Criminal Code introduced in October will,47
NA,"empower our military to target and kill a broader range of Daesh operatives, consistent with",47
NA,international law.,47
NA,The bill applies to ADF operations to fight Daesh in theatre - including our airstrikes in,47
NA,support of the liberation of Mosul.,47
NA,"Less well known, but of increasing importance, is that this fight against Daesh is also",47
NA,conducted through cyberspace.,47
NA,Now when I launched Australia's Cyber Security Strategy in April I acknowledged our,47
NA,nation's offensive cyber capabilities.,47
NA,Those capabilities are housed within the Australian Signals Directorate and they provide us,47
NA,with a capacity to deter and respond to cyber-attacks against Australia.,47
NA,"These same capabilities also have important military applications, including in support of",47
NA,Coalition operations against Daesh in Iraq and Syria.,47
NA,"While I won't, for obvious reasons, go into the details of these operations, I can say that",47
NA,"they are being used, that they are making a real difference in the military conflict, and that all",47
NA,offensive cyber activities in support of the ADF and our allies are subject to the same rules of,47
NA,"engagement which govern the use of our other military capabilities in Iraq and Syria, such as",47
NA,our FA18 Hornets.,47
NA,The Australian Signals Directorate's support for these operations is subject to stringent,47
NA,legal oversight and is consistent with our support for the international rules-based order and,47
NA,our obligations under international law.,47
NA,"This is just another example of our partnership with the United States, and is of critical",47
NA,"importance to global, regional and domestic security.",47
NA,"We've also introduced the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 to allow,",47
NA,"among other things, control orders to be placed on persons 14 years or older with appropriate",47
NA,safeguards.,47
NA,It is a sad reality that young people are being drawn to this violent ideology.,47
NA,"Ideally we want to stop them getting to this point in the first place. And on most occasions,",47
NA,"the work of families, communities, law enforcement and other agencies ensures people are",47
NA,turned away from radicalisation.,47
NA,"But it is the government's, and the parliament's, responsibility, to do what we can to",47
NA,mitigate and manage these risks by ensuring the necessary measures are in place.,47
NA,"The third bill is the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016,",47
NA,which creates a new regime to allow for the ongoing detention of high risk terrorist offenders,47
NA,who are approaching the end of their custodial sentences but continue to pose an unacceptable,47
NA,risk of committing a serious terrorism offence if released.,47
NA,"The third bill is the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016,",47
NA,which creates a new regime to allow for the ongoing detention of high-risk terrorist offenders,47
NA,who are approaching the end of their custodial sentences but continue to pose an unacceptable,47
NA,risk of committing a serious terrorism offence if released.,47
NA,NA,47
NA,"I want to thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and the",48
NA,"leadership of its chair, the member for Deakin, for its careful consideration of these bills and",48
NA,its recommendation that they be passed.,48
NA,These laws are part of my government's ongoing reform to Australia's national security,48
NA,legislation. And this started in 2014 and continues to provide our agencies with the tools they,48
NA,"need in an ever-changing security environment, and provides the public with the confidence",48
NA,that they can safely go about their daily lives.,48
NA,"From the time we came into government in 2013, the coalition has understood the evolving",48
NA,nature of the threat that terrorism poses and has been as adaptive and as agile in its response,48
NA,as the people who seek to do us so much harm.,48
NA,"Above all else, the most effective defence against terrorism is to prevent people from",48
NA,becoming terrorists in the first place. All levels of government and communities must,48
NA,"continue working together to help prevent people from being drawn to violent extremism,",48
NA,particularly to prevent the radicalisation of our young people-to stop terrorists stealing our,48
NA,children's futures.,48
NA,Continuing to build on our inclusive society where everyone has a place is vital.,48
NA,"Countering violent extremism is a shared effort, of course, with the states and territories and it",48
NA,will be reported on and considered at the upcoming Council of Australian Governments,48
NA,meeting on 9 December.,48
NA,Terrorist groups seek to identify weakness and vulnerability and to drive and exploit fear,48
NA,and division. Actions and behaviours that target particular sections in society merely play into,48
NA,their hands. We are one of the most successful multicultural societies in the world-from the,48
NA,"oldest human cultures of our First Australians, to the newborn baby in the arms of its",48
NA,immigrant mother. We are stronger because of our diversity.,48
NA,"But this does not mean we should be blind to, or ignorant of, the challenges our society",48
NA,"face. When we see extremist behaviour, it should be called out for what it is. And when we",48
NA,see vulnerability it should be addressed,48
NA,by all Australians; by government; by business; by community.,48
NA,"We all have a stake in this. For it is the combination of our national attributes of security,",48
NA,"diversity, freedom and the prosperity which they enable that make us best placed as a society",48
NA,to unite against terrorism and violent extremism.,48
NA,"As I have said many times, the glue that holds us together is mutual respect-the",48
NA,"recognition that each of us is entitled to the same respect, dignity, and opportunities.",48
NA,"And as we look forward to this Christmas season, I can assure the House that my",48
NA,"government is taking every action possible to keep Australians and their families safe, secure",48
NA,and free.,48
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (11:18): I thank the Prime,48
NA,Minister for updating the House. We welcome the fact that the Commonwealth Counter-,48
NA,Terrorism Coordinator has concluded his report on the recent dreadful overseas attacks and,48
NA,the lessons that we can learn. We hope that the government will brief us very soon on this,48
NA,report. Labor will support the review into the way defence and domestic counterterrorism,48
NA,"operations work together. I think there is merit, in particular, in looking at whether the",48
NA,NA,48
NA,existing processes around the call-out of the Defence Force for domestic terrorist incidents is,49
NA,strong enough in the current threat environment.,49
NA,This parliament works best when leaders on both sides cooperate and communicate on,49
NA,important issues such as this. I would like to briefly acknowledge former Prime Minister,49
NA,Abbott for consistently striving to keep me and Labor informed about national security. The,49
NA,Australian Labor Party fully understands and appreciates the importance of cybersecurity to,49
NA,"our national security. While there are many issues that can divide this parliament, often very",49
NA,"deeply, all of us in this place, on all sides, share a common determination to keep Australia",49
NA,"safe. We are all committed to ensuring our people, our institutions and, indeed, our",49
NA,commercial enterprises are protected by the most up-to-date technology. We are all,49
NA,committed to providing the best possible assistance to the men and women of the Australian,49
NA,"Defence Force, who have put themselves in harm's way in our country's name.",49
NA,"It is a century since Australians fought and fell on the Western Front, but there can be no",49
NA,"question that the face of global conflict has dramatically changed, and changed exponentially,",49
NA,in recent years. But the courage of those who serve our nation endures. Our respect for their,49
NA,"bravery, professionalism and skill is at the very heart of who we are as Australians and what",49
NA,"we admire about Australians, as is the important regard in which we hold our security",49
NA,"agencies and our intelligence community. When they seek our support, when they need our",49
NA,"commitment to modernisation, we should be prepared to do what it takes to keep people safe.",49
NA,The ultimate defeat of Daesh is a shared goal of all of those who believe in peace. In the,49
NA,"years since this conflict began, we have learned not to underestimate their resilience or their",49
NA,"adaptability. In fact, if we have learned anything about Daesh, it is that they will use every",49
NA,"tool at their disposal-every weapon in their arsenal-to spread hatred, to encourage violence",49
NA,"and to destroy innocent lives. Preventing this, combating terrorism and defeating extremism",49
NA,"means meeting Daesh on every front, whether it is providing air support and training in Iraq",49
NA,"or disrupting cyber operations-not just defensively, but offensively-ensuring we have, and",49
NA,"use, the ability to silence the dreadful extremist propaganda and deprive them of resources",49
NA,and information.,49
NA,Improving our cybersecurity is equally important in protecting Australia's government and,49
NA,"non-government agencies and institutions from digital attacks. In the past year alone, we have",49
NA,"seen Austrade, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Department of Defence targeted. We have",49
NA,"seen large-scale attacks and initiatives carried out around the world; perhaps, most noticeably,",49
NA,in the United States. Increased connectivity with the world through the internet for our,49
NA,businesses and communities is outstanding. It is one of the defining forces of our modern,49
NA,society and economy. But it does let others in. An increase in connections to the internet is,49
NA,matched by an increase in the number of points vulnerable to hacking and cybercrime. The,49
NA,"number of potential targets increases, and millions of our small and medium-sized businesses",49
NA,need government to help them stay safe in the digital world. They need it in a way that is,49
NA,simple enough for them to incorporate into their business and that they can afford. This means,49
NA,"having the resources to design cyber defences for our products, our processes and our",49
NA,people-Australian-developed cybersecurity capability and standards to protect all,49
NA,"Australians. That is why, in government, Labor opened the Cyber Security Operations Centre",49
NA,and adopted Australia's first comprehensive Cyber Security Strategy.,49
NA,NA,49
NA,But we recognise that the scale and speed of change in this area mean that nothing can,50
NA,"stand in stone. In the last two years, there has been more data created than in the entire",50
NA,previous history of the human race. We are living in a time when technology and invention,50
NA,"are streaking ahead of traditional security and legal frameworks. Today, almost without",50
NA,"thinking, Australians store and share vast amounts of private and personal information",50
NA,"online-banking credit-debit records, medical history, tax and income data, intellectual",50
NA,"property. It is why The Economist in 2014 estimated the global cost of cybercrime,",50
NA,intellectual property theft and espionage was around $445 billion a year. That is before we,50
NA,consider what we share on social media about ourselves. Like all parents in this place and,50
NA,"around Australia, I am conscious that social media has fundamentally reshaped childhood for",50
NA,this generation of Australians.,50
NA,"For all of these reasons, we cannot afford to assume that cybersecurity is a niche issue for",50
NA,"techxperts, the harmless hobby of a few dedicated followers. We must recognise that there is",50
NA,"no such thing as an unhackable system, no such thing as a foolproof platform. Instead, the",50
NA,world's leading cybersecurity experts all say we should begin from the assumption that there,50
NA,"are already people inside the system. Our focus should be on finding out what they are doing,",50
NA,tracing their activity and preventing others from using the same entry point.,50
NA,The key words in every cybersecurity conversation are trust and collaboration. No,50
NA,government has the reach or resources to act in this field alone. We must collaborate with the,50
NA,"private sector, sharing information and strategies, learning from each other's successes and",50
NA,failures. That is true as well for cooperation with our international peers. We need to seek a,50
NA,"new layer of engagement with our old allies and partners, recognising that frameworks and",50
NA,treaties written for a Cold War world need to be updated for an age where people can google,50
NA,bomb-making instructions and 3D-print guns. This is particularly important in our region. As,50
NA,"Daesh is driven closer to defeat in the field, there is a very real risk of former extremists",50
NA,"demobilising in our region-trained in the Middle East, better trained in combat, more",50
NA,"radicalised than when they left. Managing this threat, keeping not only Australia but South-",50
NA,"East Asia safe, will require our leadership and multilateral institutions and our example as a",50
NA,"democratic, peaceful, prosperous and secure nation.",50
NA,"It is vital we continue to enhance the reach and flexibility of our cybersecurity capabilities,",50
NA,"but I also have to add that all of the good work, all of the unreplaceable investment in",50
NA,"technological safety, can count for nothing unless we continue to invest in the very human",50
NA,"element of countering extremism. There are not enough walls, weapons and technology to",50
NA,"guarantee safety alone, unless we deploy our citizens in the pursuit of combating extremism.",50
NA,"Of course, when I talk about our citizens, I am mindful that one of the most powerful assets in",50
NA,"the fight against terrorism does not wear a uniform or wield a weapon; it is our united,",50
NA,"harmonious, inclusive nation. As the Prime Minister said so well in parliament only last",50
NA,month:,50
NA,The terrorists want the wider Australian community to turn against Australian Muslims. Their message,50
NA,"to Australian Muslims is, 'You're not wanted here. You will never be accepted here. You cannot be",50
NA,Australian.',50
NA,"So in this place we have a solemn responsibility to counter that argument of the extremists, of",50
NA,the extreme right and the extremists in the Middle East who say that being a Muslim citizen,50
NA,"of this democracy is incompatible with their faith. We need to counter that argument, not",50
NA,NA,50
NA,"amplify it. It is our job, our duty, to foster a more inclusive, a more respectful, a more",51
NA,egalitarian Australia. We do not just tolerate diversity; we embrace diversity. We do not just,51
NA,acknowledge multiculturalism; we embrace multiculturalism-as a bipartisan achievement,51
NA,and as a shared priority.,51
NA,And no individual in this place did more to shape the modern diverse nation that we,51
NA,cherish today than Malcolm Fraser. As the Prime Minister generously said in condolences,51
NA,"about the former Liberal Prime Minister, he was so far ahead of his time. The Prime Minister",51
NA,said:,51
NA,"When you look at what he did in respect of shaping the nature of Australia today, it is really quite",51
NA,remarkable.,51
NA,"As the Prime Minister reminded us in his most recent statement, just minutes ago, there is no",51
NA,bliss in ignorance. All of these are reasons why the Minister for Immigration and Border,51
NA,Protection's recent comments were so profoundly wrong. Suggesting it was a mistake to allow,51
NA,"a generation of migrants to come to Australia more than three decades ago, because of the",51
NA,"crimes of a tiny handful of their grandchildren, is not just ignorant and insulting; it is not just",51
NA,a denigration of people who have worked so hard and given so much to this country. The,51
NA,"comments were not just a repudiation of the success of Australia, a nation made great by",51
NA,"migration and multiculturalism. The minister's ignorant comments contradict, undermine and",51
NA,fly in the face of every briefing I have ever received from our security agencies who explain,51
NA,"to us how best to counter radicalisation, about defeating extremism.",51
NA,"Loud, lazy disrespect, wholesale labelling of entire communities for the actions of a tiny",51
NA,"minority, aid and abet the isolation and resentment that the extremists prey upon. In this place",51
NA,we are leaders. We do not just cater for majorities; we respect minorities. We do expect,51
NA,"anyone who comes here to adhere to our laws and our values, but we must take the",51
NA,"responsibility of leadership most seriously with how we act, with what we say. It is time for",51
NA,some leadership from the Prime Minister. It is time that the minister for immigration was,51
NA,brought into line. As the remarkable member for Cowan-who was involved in driving WA,51
NA,"Labor's Cyber Security Strategy seven years ago-said this morning, and I agree, 'I am fearful",51
NA,that the minister for immigration's comments will be used by an extreme few who would seek,51
NA,to harm the fabric of our society.' Second and third generation migrants are teachers. They are,51
NA,police officers. They are entrepreneurs. They are members of this parliament on both sides of,51
NA,the House. They serve in our hospitals and they serve in the uniform of our country. They,51
NA,raise children. They pay taxes. They build communities. They coach local sporting teams.,51
NA,"They create small businesses. They volunteer. They do, as I say, sit on both sides of this",51
NA,"chamber. And we, in the Labor Party, do not start by calling them 'second and third",51
NA,generation migrants'; we call them 'Australians'.,51
NA,"And, in an age of rapidly evolving threats, of shifting battlegrounds and whole new forms",51
NA,"of crime, we must continue to adapt our processes, our technologies and our capabilities. Our",51
NA,country requires it. The effort of our ADF personnel who put their lives on the line require us,51
NA,to do here the very best we can do. But we must also never lose sight of old truths in the,51
NA,search for new security. All of the machines and all of the walls and all of the guards are,51
NA,insufficient if we do not reach out and include all of those in our own society. We are always,51
NA,"and every time a stronger nation and a safer place when we stand together. Now and always,",51
NA,let that guide us.,51

Ms HENDERSON ,"Corangamite) (11:32): It is my pleasure to rise and speak on this bill,",52
NA,"the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016,",52
NA,"in continuation. I was talking about the three stages of the PaTH program, which will support",52
NA,"up to 120,000 young people over four years. The first stage is getting them ready-preparing",52
NA,"young people. The second stage is giving them a go-trialling them through an internship,",52
NA,supported by a youth bonus wage subsidy and voluntary internships of between four and 12,52
NA,"weeks where employers will receive an incentive of $1,000 up-front and a young person, an",52
NA,"intern, will receive a $200-a-fortnight payment to supplement their Newstart allowance-on",52
NA,"top of their Newstart allowance. Then, of course, the third part of this program is hire-giving",52
NA,"young people a job. In order to provide that incentive to employers, the government is",52
NA,proposing that businesses will be eligible for a youth bonus wage subsidy of between $6½,52
NA,"thousand and $10,000 from 1 January next year.",52
NA,This bill is needed because it is required to ensure jobseekers are not disadvantaged by,52
NA,taking part in the Youth Jobs PaTH measure announced in the budget to encourage eligible,52
NA,"young jobseekers to take up a PaTH internship. Participants, as I have mentioned, will receive",52
NA,NA,52
NA,$200 fortnightly in addition to their social security payments. The bill ensures that these,53
NA,payments are not considered as income for social security and veterans' entitlement purposes.,53
NA,That is obviously very important; we do not want to do anything that will impact on their,53
NA,"social security entitlements. So it will amend the Social Security Act, the Veterans'",53
NA,Entitlements Act and the Social Security (Administration) Act to support the Youth Jobs,53
NA,PaTH measure.,53
NA,I do want to make some particular comments in relation to the member for Melbourne's,53
NA,contribution and more broadly in relation to some of the opposition that we have heard from,53
NA,members opposite. This is an incredibly important program for young people. In contrast to,53
NA,"those opposite and to the Greens, here we are, as a government, looking at every possible",53
NA,measure to drive young people into work. We are incredibly proud of what we are doing. And,53
NA,it is absolutely fallacious to suggest that this is a $4-an-hour program. What we are providing,53
NA,is a $200-a-fortnight bonus-that is in addition to Newstart; $200 extra per fortnight-which,53
NA,"will put young people into the position of an internship for a limited period of time and, very",53
NA,"importantly, will give employers the opportunity to trial someone and to train them. We all",53
NA,"know that, when an employer brings anyone new into their business, there is a high degree of",53
NA,"commitment by that employer to introduce a young person into the workplace, to train them",53
NA,"and to get them job-ready, and the employer does not do that unless he or she, or the",53
NA,"company, has a commitment to bringing someone into their organisation. It is also great",53
NA,opportunity for young people: to learn new skills; to get a taste of that industry or to get an,53
NA,understanding of that business; to get a sense of self-worth; to be encouraged; to be inspired;,53
NA,"and of course, in doing so, to receive this important bonus.",53
NA,"So it is really regrettable that, while we have had this criticism both from the Greens and",53
NA,"from the Labor Party, we have seen no ideas from members opposite. What are their ideas?",53
NA,We have seen no contrary ideas from the Labor Party.,53
NA,"As a government, we are doing everything possible to drive jobs, to drive new programs",53
NA,and to look at new ways of getting young people into work. And its is not just through the,53
NA,"PaTH program. We have our $96 million Try, Test and Learn Fund, introduced by the",53
NA,"Minister for Social Services, asking all members of the community-volunteer groups,",53
NA,community organisations and members opposite-to come up with innovative employment,53
NA,ideas to drive employment. But what do we hear today from the member for Melbourne? No,53
NA,ideas. It is a zero ideas zone from the Greens and from members opposite. We recognise that,53
NA,"government does not have all the ideas, and we are saying to Australians, 'Here is nearly $100",53
NA,million for an innovative scheme'-like a scheme that is being promoted and funded in my,53
NA,"region, the GROW scheme, where G21 and Give Where You Live have done some wonderful",53
NA,"work to try to address the very significant problems with youth unemployment, particularly in",53
NA,the Geelong region.,53
NA,"We are making some very important inroads, despite some members opposite-particularly",53
NA,the member for Corio-trying to talk down our local economy at every opportunity. Last,53
NA,month's unemployment figures show that unemployment in the Geelong is currently sitting at,53
NA,"four per cent, with a three-month rolling average of 5.8 per cent. Despite all the criticism from",53
NA,"those opposite, we are doing so much better than the Labor Party have ever given us credit",53
NA,"for. While we get criticism from those opposite, what is remarkable in this debate is that we",53
NA,have no ideas from those opposite.,53
NA,NA,53
NA,"Not only do we have our Try, Test and Learn scheme on top of our PaTH scheme; we have",54
NA,"the Transition to Work scheme, which is an alternative for the jobactive providers. It supports",54
NA,young people aged 15 to 21 through intensive pre-employment support to improve work,54
NA,"readiness and help them into work or education. We have the ParentsNext program, which",54
NA,"helps eligible parents to identify their education and employment goals-again, to help them",54
NA,"get into work. We have our Empowering YOUth Initiative, again to support innovative",54
NA,approaches to helping young unemployed people move into work. We are absolutely,54
NA,"committed and doing everything we can to drive those jobs and to drive those opportunities,",54
NA,"and it is really disappointing that we have not seen some bipartisanship on what is a very,",54
NA,very significant measure.,54
NA,"The Minister for Employment, Senator Michaelia Cash, did an extraordinary job in leading",54
NA,"our charge in passing the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, which",54
NA,"of course is a bill that is all about putting Australian workers first. In contrast to Labor, who",54
NA,"wanted to back the union organisers, including those who had engaged in fraud and",54
NA,"corruption, which is very disappointing, our government is focused on putting Australian",54
NA,workers first. It was wonderful to visit Kings Cars with the minister and to talk-,54
Mr Champion," Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member is reflecting",54
NA,"on members opposite and saying that they support fraud. That is not the case, and she should",54
NA,withdraw.,54
Mr Irons, That is not what she said.,54
Mr Champion, That is exactly what she said.,54
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Goodenough): I call the member for Corangamite.,54
Ms HENDERSON," Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not withdraw. That is not what I said. I",54
NA,said that the Labor Party did not support a bill which combats union organisers engaging in,54
NA,"fraud, engaging in corruption and engaging in dodgy union deals.",54
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, There is no point of order. Please continue.,54
Ms HENDERSON, This is a great opportunity for me to say it again. What an absolute,54
NA,"disgrace it is that the Labor Party did not support the Registered Organisations Bill, in",54
NA,"contrast to the likes of the former Labor Attorney-General Rob MCClelland, in contrast to the",54
NA,"likes of Martin Ferguson and in contrast to the likes of Bill Kelty, who all stood up and said,",54
NA,"'Yes, we do require this reform; we do need to put Australian workers first.' So thank you for",54
NA,the opportunity to make that point. It was a shameful day when the Labor Party would not,54
NA,support this vital industrial relations reform for our nation.,54
NA,"As I was saying, in May, the Minister for Employment, Senator Michaelia Cash, and I",54
NA,"visited Kings Cars, one of the many local employers in our region, and spoke very, very",54
NA,proudly about the Youth PaTH employment program. It is getting a lot of support and we are,54
NA,very enthusiastic as to how we can work locally with our local employers to make sure that as,54
NA,many employers as possible take up this opportunity and give young people a chance-,54
NA,because that is what it is all about.,54
NA,Everything our government is doing is about putting the Australian worker first and driving,54
NA,"jobs, and we are so proud. I will take the opportunity to look at what we are doing locally.",54
NA,"There is our massive investment in infrastructure, including, at long last, the $690 million that",54
NA,has been provided for rural and regional roads in Victoria. We had to drag the Labor Party,54
NA,NA,54
NA,kicking and screaming in Victoria on that one. There is more investment in rail and our huge,55
NA,commitment to Avalon Airport-all about driving jobs. There are our massive job creation,55
NA,"programs, including a $20 million jobs and investment package for our region, which is very",55
NA,"significant-looking at new investment, new opportunities, new industries and new jobs,",55
NA,including new jobs for young people. There is our Geelong Region Innovation and Investment,55
NA,"Fund, which has created some 850 new jobs across our region. There is our $155 million",55
NA,"Growth Fund. There is the Geelong Region Job Connections program, supporting lots of",55
NA,"fantastic grassroots job creation programs, including supporting the Pivot Summit, which I",55
NA,"will be very proudly opening on Friday-driving digital jobs, jobs for the future and jobs for",55
NA,young people.,55
NA,There is our focus on advanced manufacturing. What a reflection it was on Labor when,55
NA,"they committed only around $7 million to our region, in contrast to our very significant",55
NA,"investments in advanced manufacturing, including an industry growth centre in advanced",55
NA,manufacturing and $4.7 million for Deakin University for the Future Fibres Research Hub.,55
NA,There is also our strong commitment to the National Stronger Regions Fund and our strong,55
NA,"commitment to small and medium business-delivering those tax cuts. Back in 2011, the",55
NA,Labor Party were very supportive of tax cuts for smalland medium-size businesses. Back,55
NA,then they were being quite open with the Australian people and acknowledging that that did,55
NA,"drive new jobs, more investment and more opportunities. But now we see in another blatant,",55
NA,"pathetic case of politicking, led by the Leader of the Opposition, an illogical opposition to tax",55
NA,"cuts for small business. Then there are our free trade agreements-again, all about driving",55
NA,jobs.,55
NA,We are getting the economy boosted again-as we did when we abolished the carbon tax,55
NA,and the mining tax and stripped red tape-and proudly doing all these important things to,55
NA,"drive jobs and investment. This is a very important bill for young people and for our nation,",55
NA,and I commend this bill to the House.,55
Mr CHAMPION ,Wakefield) (11:45): I wish I could say it was a pleasure to follow the,55
NA,member for Corangamite in rising to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment,55
NA,"(Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. Such are the delusions of this government,",55
NA,where they think if they get up and say the word 'strong' and 'we are backing Australian,55
NA,workers first' enough times that it will somehow echo and ricochet from this parliament out,55
NA,"there into the community. But the community, of course, know exactly what this government",55
NA,is up to in a whole range of areas because they see in this parliament every single day that we,55
NA,either have no positive agenda at all or we have these rampant reactionary measures. The,55
NA,"member opposite wandered from this bill, which is all about internships, and into industrial",55
NA,relations-all sort of weaved into the ABCC. What I would like to let the House know is that,55
NA,the Australian Building and Construction Commission does not deal with criminal behaviour,55
NA,at all.,55
NA,There was a fellow in my electorate named Ark Tribe. He lived out in Middle Beach and he,55
NA,worked on the Flinders hospital site. He was worried about the safety of himself and the,55
NA,"workers at that site, so they held a safety meeting because they were worried about working in",55
NA,an unsafe environment. And do you know what happened? He got hauled before the courts by,55
NA,Gestapo style tactics for months and months and months of his life. He was not a corrupt,55
NA,union official; he was just a construction worker who wanted to work in a safe environment.,55
NA,NA,55
NA,Those opposite want to criminalise that sort of behaviour and want to pretend that it is wrong.,56
NA,"The fact is, people like Ark Tribe are the real Australians who are really representing the",56
NA,"Australian tradition-that of a fair go, of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, of working in a",56
NA,"safe environment and of being able to come home to your family. Instead, we have this",56
NA,nonsense where those opposite talk about fraud. There is a place to deal with fraud whether it,56
NA,"is in unions, the local footy club, a company or anywhere else in the community and it is",56
NA,called the courts. And guess what: they are doing it every single day. There is nothing,56
NA,particularly special about it. That is the way we have set up our community for the,56
NA,administration of justice. That is the way we should pursue it because that is the best way to,56
NA,pursue it. We should leave industrial relations separate from criminal law.,56
NA,I guess we should talk about this bill. The other thing those opposite like to do is talk about,56
NA,"real-life experience. I was a union official and, on occasion, I had stop-work meetings. These",56
NA,"days, those opposite might have put me in jail for it. I might be in chains, like my forebear:",56
NA,"my great-grandfather, Peter Roberts. He was on the docks at Geelong. He died in an unsafe",56
NA,work environment. He was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. Those opposite,56
NA,would have banged him up because that is what they are about. They are about criminalising,56
NA,trade unions and trade union activity.,56
NA,Mr Falinski interjecting-,56
Mr CHAMPION, That is what was said. Let me tell you about what happened when I,56
NA,was a union official. Every so often I used to have to go out to some small retail,56
NA,establishment. I would be there and they would have somebody in to do 'work experience' or,56
NA,"as an 'intern'. This would go on for weeks, sometimes months, and these people would be",56
NA,used to displace existing workers. Sometimes it was not such small institutions. We had one,56
NA,"major retailer do it once. And I would have to patiently explain to those institutions, those",56
NA,commercial organisations that what they were doing was in fact illegal and that they should,56
NA,be paying these people.,56
NA,"From time to time some manager, or sometimes it was an owner of a company, would get",56
NA,"into his head that maybe, if he had people come in as interns or for work experience, that",56
NA,would be a great boon to his business and that somehow the individual committing this free,56
NA,"work would also get a benefit. Now, from this article in The Sydney Morning Herald by Clara",56
NA,"Jordan-Baird, who is the national policy director of Interns Australia, I have got some figures:",56
NA,'Only 20 per cent of unpaid interns are offered employment with the same organisation.' What,56
NA,happens to the other 80 per cent? I can tell you from my real-life experience: they get,56
NA,exploited. Let us think about that.,56
NA,We roughly know what will happen under this bill and it will all come out in the Senate,56
NA,inquiry. The government is attempting to institute a program where we know the majority of,56
NA,people in the scheme are going to be exploited in some way.,56
NA,Government members interjecting-,56
Mr CHAMPION, I suppose I will be generous with those opposite after the interjections.,56
NA,I heard the member for Corangamite talk. I remember being on the backbench of a,56
NA,government that was in a death spiral. You know those dive-bombers? I had a constituent who,56
NA,was in a dive-bomber. He was a guy who had to sit in the rear seat and he was the gunner.,56
NA,That is who you guys opposite are: you are in the rear seat of a plane and you are assuming,56
NA,NA,56
NA,"there is a pilot in the front, but they have bailed out and you are just sitting in the back and",57
NA,shooting away and you are taking out the rudder and the wings and you are hurtling towards,57
NA,the ground. And as you are hurtling towards the ground you are issuing orders to the rest of,57
NA,us. You are giving us your bon mots of wisdom as you hurtle towards the ground.,57
NA,"I have been there, so I am not telling you how to suck eggs. But from these situations-and",57
NA,I have certainly seen enough of them in my time in parliament-we should know the sorts of,57
NA,"rorts that go on and the sorts of people, the bottom feeders, who are attracted to programs just",57
NA,"like this. To be fair to those opposite, we have seen it in all sorts of programs across",57
NA,administrations. The LPG subsidy was my favourite. It was started by Howard. There was,57
NA,"$3,000 to subsidise LPG conversions. Australian taxpayers spent $750-odd million",57
NA,subsidising commercial activity that would have gone on anyway. All it did was drag demand,57
NA,forward. It doubled the price of LPG conversions. No-one was keeping an eye on that.,57
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ," Mr Goodenough): Member for Corangamite, do you have a",57
NA,point of order?,57
NA,"Ms Henderson: Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to remind the member to confine his",57
NA,remarks to the bill. This is a speech on the bill that is before the House at the moment.,57
The DEPUTY SPEAKER," On relevance, I call the member for Wakefield.",57
Mr CHAMPION," Was anybody here for her speech? Anyway, I am happy to relate it",57
NA,back to the bill because I am talking about the sorts of rorts that can go on under programs,57
NA,just like this. I will arrive at my point if you will allow me to just take this slightly circuitous,57
NA,route.,57
NA,"We had a program that did not create a job, that subsidised commercial activity that was",57
NA,"going to go on anyway, that dragged all this demand forward and that did not do the industry",57
NA,"one lick of good, because I can tell you it cost jobs in the end. I saw LPG conversion",57
NA,companies go out of business because all the work had been done in this massive boom that,57
NA,did nothing but push prices up. And you can bet that there were a few bottom feeders who,57
NA,entered that industry just to get their hands on the subsidy.,57
NA,"Here we have this program, which puts a $1,000 incentive into the business and then a",57
NA,"wage subsidy after that, where we have a group of vulnerable potential interns. We know",57
NA,youth unemployment is at extraordinary levels and that it is often regionally based. I know,57
NA,exactly what the member for Corangamite is talking about when she talks about the,57
NA,"challenges of this and the desire to do something, but it has actually got to be the right thing to",57
NA,"do. Nobody on the government side of the program has gotten up and said, 'Well, this won't",57
NA,be rorted. Don't worry about it; we've got all these protections in there.' What you are setting,57
NA,"up here is a program with no protections. For a start, in this bill there is no definition of 'an",57
NA,intern'. I could set up an intern pathway company where I partner with small business to take,57
NA,"the interns from one place to another, and maybe I would get a fee and everybody would be a",57
NA,winner.,57
Mr Coleman, Think positively.,57
Mr CHAMPION, Think positively! The member opposite tells me to think positively. I,57
NA,have been here too long to be so naive about the sorts of people who would be attracted to this,57
NA,"program, because we have just seen it in VET FEE-HELP. I remember being in the",57
NA,government party room when we were told about VET FEE-HELP.,57
NA,NA,57
NA,Ms Henderson interjecting-,58
Mr CHAMPION, Listen to this. It was supposed to be for TAFE. Then it was extended to,58
NA,"private providers. Then, what happened? You came into government, and what did you try to",58
NA,do? You tried to fix it up-four or five times.,58
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, The member for Wakefield will resume his seat. The member,58
NA,for Corangamite on a point of order?,58
NA,"Ms Henderson: Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask that the member direct his comments",58
NA,through the chair.,58
Mr CHAMPION, I am happy to direct my comments through the chair. This government,58
NA,attempted to fix that program four or five times. Eventually Senator Birmingham from the,58
NA,"other place did it. I know Senator Birmingham. He is a smart cookie. He has now fixed it,",58
NA,"because he has come down on them like a ton of bricks. Previous ministers tried to say,",58
NA,'Maybe we can negotiate with these people.' The truth is that whenever there is a,58
NA,Commonwealth dollar you can bet your bottom dollar-do not be naive about it-that there,58
NA,will be some bottom feeder out there who will set up a method of rorting the program.,58
NA,Ms Henderson interjecting-,58
Mr CHAMPION, Those opposite come in here with their rote-learning speeches where,58
NA,they recite the lines-and the member for Corangamite is a little bit better at disguising the,58
NA,"lines. I heard some speeches last night. Honestly, they turn page 3 and then this is what page 4",58
NA,says. I have seen speeches like that before-on both sides of the House. But the learning from,58
NA,"this is that you need to question the executive, because when they come up with a program",58
NA,"like this, which, frankly, you could drive a truck through-there is no definition of 'an intern'",58
NA,and no real safeguards-it could be rorted by a middle man or by just your local company,58
NA,"who thinks, 'Well, I'm going to get rid of all my existing workers and bring in all these",58
NA,interns.' And do not tell me it will not happen. I have seen whole companies where everybody,58
NA,"is on a traineeship. There is nobody to train the trainees, because every single employee was",58
NA,on a traineeship. I remember one South Australian employer where even the owner of the,58
NA,"company was on the traineeship. That was in the Howard years, so we are going back a few",58
NA,years.,58
NA,There has been completely shameless abuse of government programs across governments,58
NA,of various persuasions. So this is the thing: do not think that there is not someone out there,58
NA,"right at this moment looking at this bill and thinking, 'How can I make some money out of",58
NA,this? How can I exploit this? How can I use this?' because you can bet they will. And you will,58
NA,have to come back here when the first scandal comes out and we will read all your speeches,58
NA,back to you. When it appears on the ABC or when The Sydney Morning Herald does an,58
NA,"investigation, guess what will happen? We will have to come back here and read all of your",58
NA,silly speeches about it where you recited the lines that were written by some 22-year-old in,58
NA,the minister's office-with all of that life experience there.,58
NA,"That is the problem with this bill. It is just sloppy. And whatever you say, we have got a",58
NA,"second reading amendment with which the member for Chifley, he has learnt, is wisely going",58
NA,"to push it off into a Senate inquiry. Hopefully, that will tighten this bill up. This is dangerous",58
NA,"stuff, because it is full of exactly the sort of naive thinking, the wishful thinking, that is",58
NA,"present on this government's back bench. As I said before, they are in a death spiral, so they",58
NA,NA,58
NA,are grasping onto whatever they can. But this is the wrong thing to grasp onto. I would,59
NA,"encourage those opposite to start doing your jobs on the back bench. Behind the scenes,",59
NA,actually start to put a bit of pressure on your executive-who are all shifting though their jobs,59
NA,"so quickly that they are not really paying attention, let's be honest, with all the ministerial",59
NA,changes in this government. Start doing your jobs.,59
Mr FALINSKI ,"Mackellar) (12:00): We can now resume normal transmission, I think.",59
NA,"This is a critical piece of reform. For far too long too many people have languished, trapped,",59
NA,"in the social security system, and the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs",59
NA,"Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016 is the beginning of a long and arduous journey to change",59
NA,the status quo.,59
NA,"Having run my own business, I know the challenges that businesses face when employing",59
NA,"people they do not know, particularly those who have never worked before. To a small",59
NA,"business, the cost of not getting it right can be expensive in terms of time and money and,",59
NA,"most importantly, in lost opportunities. Employers often attempt to contain that risk by",59
NA,"choosing to employ people with work experience and a proven track record. Unfortunately,",59
NA,"this traps those who are trying to get ahead, trying to break out of the welfare system.",59
NA,Over the last 24 hours I have borne witness to the Labor Party lecturing the rest of us on,59
NA,inequality in Australia. The member for Lilley was particularly illuminating on the issue.,59
NA,Never once did he mention microeconomic reform as a key platform to alleviating inequality.,59
NA,Never once did he talk about breaking the cycle of welfare dependency and unemployment.,59
NA,But we do. We talk about reform. We care about breaking the cycle of poverty and we care,59
NA,"about employment, because the awful truth is this: that, after nearly seven decades of",59
NA,"government-funded poverty programs, we have hardly moved the needle.",59
NA,Many social programs during this time have done nothing more than entrench poverty from,59
NA,"one generation to the next. It is simply a fact that, if you are solely reliant on the welfare",59
NA,"system in today's Australia, it is highly likely that your health and education outcomes will be",59
NA,"substantially lower and you will have a shorter lifespan. At the same time, the chances of you",59
NA,"forming a household are very low, while the likelihood of the system passing these outcomes",59
NA,"onto your children is very high. This system costs $154 billion a year. In truth, the money is a",59
NA,"second-order issue, because the Turnbull government is about saving lives, not money. When",59
NA,"we on this side talk about reforming welfare-we are talking about saving lives, not money.",59
NA,Those opposite typically provide two solutions to alleviating inequality: the first is,59
NA,increased spending on welfare; the second is a more distributive tax system. Despite,59
NA,"dedicating hundreds of billions of dollars to decreasing inequality, those opposite say things",59
NA,"have got worse, and yet their only answer is to keep doing more of the same. Labor can talk",59
NA,"ad nauseam about inequality, because they need people to feel like they are victims and",59
NA,supplicants of the state. Under no circumstances will they talk about the inequality of,59
NA,opportunity that their own policies have created.,59
NA,"Of Australians aged under 20 who are on income support, 67,000 have, or have had, a",59
NA,guardian who has been on welfare for the last 15 years. Our lifetime welfare bill has now,59
NA,reached an estimated $4.8 trillion dollars. That is not an amount we should try and grasp in,59
NA,"terms of dollars and cents, but rather as a sum total of human misery. But numbers do not",59
NA,paint pictures. This is the story of a never-ending cycle of poverty passed on from generation,59
NA,to generation.,59
NA,NA,59
NA,"On this side of the House, we believe in standing up for hardworking Australians who",60
NA,"aspire to a better future for their friends, their families and this great country-a modern and",60
NA,"dynamic society that believes in helping people up, not dragging them down-with",60
NA,"government as the great enabler, not the great enforcer. I am proud to be part of the Turnbull",60
NA,government that recognises that a new approach is urgently required. We cannot,60
NA,underestimate the urgency of the now. The Youth Jobs PaTH is part of our government's $840,60
NA,"million project to improve people's chances of making a go of life, of getting and keeping",60
NA,"them out of welfare and helping them to achieve their aspirations. The package, which is part",60
NA,"of the Australian Priority Investment approach to welfare, provides a new, cutting-edge",60
NA,"approach to youth employment. It will help 120,000 vulnerable young Australians over four",60
NA,years take advantage of job opportunities as our economy diversifies and transitions to,60
NA,broader based growth. It will help young people to get ready for meaningful work by giving,60
NA,them the tools they need to have a go and get a job.,60
NA,The Turnbull government is seeking to improve employment outcomes for Australia's,60
NA,"young people in a real, meaningful and tangible way by making it easier for them to enter the",60
NA,workforce. Young Australians should have the personal and financial opportunities that come,60
NA,"with having a job-the independence, the experience, the self-esteem, the excitement and the",60
NA,chance to hone their skills. This aspect of employment is too often ignored by those on the,60
NA,Left of politics. The simple sense of achievement on someone's mentality has transformed,60
NA,lives and entire communities. Our future prosperity as a nation will suffer if we do not,60
NA,persistently tackle high levels of youth unemployment. Young people who cannot find a job,60
NA,"are more susceptible to long-term unemployment and, from that place, it is a short trip to a",60
NA,cycle of welfare dependency.,60
NA,I welcome the reductions in the youth unemployment rate that this government has seen so,60
NA,"far, but the numbers are still too high. We have identified that it is often a lack of experience",60
NA,"that keeps young people out of the workforce, so we are implementing a measure that will",60
NA,facilitate young people getting exactly that experience so they might find it easier to gain,60
NA,meaningful employment. The Youth Jobs PaTH program will help and encourage young,60
NA,"Australians to learn new skills, become job ready, get a job, and stay in a job.",60
NA,"Having had open and frank conversations with the businesses of Australia, looking at the",60
NA,"preliminary findings of the 'investment approach' actuarial analysis, and studying best",60
NA,"practices both here and abroad, we have designed an innovative program that will make a real",60
NA,"difference to young Australians. The prepare, trial, hire pathway will encourage employers to",60
NA,"take a chance on young people by enhancing their employability, providing them real work",60
NA,"experience, and increasing incentives for employers to take them on.",60
NA,"Importantly, the program will give vulnerable young people that are trying to better their",60
NA,"lives and create a future for themselves the confidence they need to transition to, find and",60
NA,retain work. We need to understand that what many of us in this place take for granted for,60
NA,"some people is simply unknown. Vulnerable young Australians have no, or virtually no,",60
NA,"experience of what work looks like, of what the expectations are in terms of practice,",60
NA,"behaviour, what to wear, what is done and, more importantly, what is not done at work.",60
NA,"The Youth Jobs PaTH is divided into three stages: prepare, trial and hire. To help young",60
NA,"people gain a foothold in the labour market, young jobseekers will participate in intensive",60
NA,pre-employment skills training within five months of registering with jobactive. The first,60
NA,NA,60
NA,"three weeks of training will focus on skills such as working in a team, presentation, and",61
NA,"appropriate IT skills, like limiting your use of Facebook. A further three weeks of training",61
NA,will centre on advanced job preparation and job hunting skills.,61
NA,"The government will introduce up to 120,000 internship placements over four years to help",61
NA,young jobseekers who have been in employment services for six months or more gain,61
NA,"valuable work experience. Jobseekers and businesses, with the help of employment services",61
NA,"providers, will work together to design internships of four to 12 weeks duration, during which",61
NA,the jobseeker will work 15 to 25 hours per week. Participation in an internship will be,61
NA,voluntary for both jobseekers and employers.,61
NA,"In addition to gaining valuable hands on experience in a workplace, young people will",61
NA,receive $200 per fortnight on top of their regular income support payment while participating,61
NA,"in the internship. People that take on interns will receive an upfront payment of $1,000, and",61
NA,will benefit from the opportunity to see what a young worker can do and how they fit into the,61
NA,team before deciding whether to offer them a permanent job.,61
NA,Stage 3 of the new Youth Jobs PaTH provides increased and streamlined wage subsidies,61
NA,for young people. Australian employers will be eligible for a youth bonus wage subsidy if,61
NA,they hire a young jobseeker who has been in employment services for six months or more.,61
NA,"Businesses will have the flexibility to employ young jobseekers either directly, through labour",61
NA,"hire arrangements, or combined with an apprenticeship or traineeship. As part of these",61
NA,"reforms, existing wage subsidies will be streamlined, making them easier for employers to",61
NA,"access. In our modern and dynamic economy, highly entrepreneurial and flexible firms with",61
NA,dynamic mindsets will proliferate.,61
NA,Yesterday I heard from Bernard Salt that five of America's top 10 companies were formed,61
NA,"within the past 40 years. In Australia, our top 10 most valuable companies were founded",61
NA,"before 1929. We need business leaders with new ideas. And, as much as it pains me to say it,",61
NA,young people are the source of most these bright new ideas. The Turnbull government will,61
NA,also encourage young people to start their own businesses by fostering their innovation and,61
NA,interest in self-employment.,61
NA,It is interesting that in the United States some of these innovative companies were formed,61
NA,by people still in their 20s-people like Mark Zuckerberg. Bill Gates was only 19 when he,61
NA,started Microsoft and created the DOS operating system that IBM bought. Even Warren,61
NA,"Buffett started his funds management company when he was only 22. In Australia, this sort of",61
NA,entrepreneurship needs to be both encouraged and developed. This government will be part of,61
NA,enabling that to occur. It is this sort of stuff that not only helps young people find jobs that,61
NA,they love and that they want to be involved in but also builds our economy. It also helps,61
NA,"create companies that pay taxes, that create jobs, that create wage growth, that create more",61
NA,"competition in our marketplace and ensure that all of us, all consumers have the benefits of",61
NA,"competition in the marketplace, so governments do not need to regulate as much, so that we",61
NA,can get out of the way of the market and allow people to enjoy the benefits thereof.,61
NA,"This bill, along with all the other reforms the Turnbull government is implementing, is",61
NA,about people's lives. It is about making a real difference to vulnerable members of our,61
NA,"community. It shows that if you are willing to work hard, to put yourself out there, this",61
NA,government will support you no matter what your circumstances. This bill is not about the,61
NA,"soft prejudice that says that people from tough backgrounds cannot aspire to something better,",61
NA,NA,61
NA,that they are victims now and will forever-more be victims. This says that the human potential,62
NA,"inherent in all of us will be supported and encouraged, that no person is not worth something,",62
NA,and that everyone can make a contribution. It is about saying that we believe that everyone,62
NA,"can make a difference for themselves and for their families, and that if they are willing, this",62
NA,"government, the Turnbull government, will support them. And we will break the cycle of",62
NA,poverty that has endured in this country for far too long.,62
Ms SHARKIE ,Mayo) (12:14): I want our government to provide tangible opportunities,62
NA,for young people to gain relevant on-the-job training and experience. I worked for more than,62
NA,four years in executive roles in the youth space. When you know the challenges that face,62
NA,"unemployed young people like I do, you really do want ideas like the ones contained in this",62
NA,"legislation to work. However, I must put my concerns before the House.",62
NA,"As I outlined in my first speech, many young people in our country, for a variety of",62
NA,"complex reasons, are struggling to transition to employment. Contributing significantly to the",62
NA,youth unemployment rate is the reality that every year fewer and fewer entry-level jobs exist.,62
NA,"Young people who are underemployed, early school leavers or those who fail to transition",62
NA,successfully from school to further education or employment are some of our most vulnerable,62
NA,members in our society. High youth unemployment rates and overrepresentation in,62
NA,underemployment mean that young people who are disengaged from education are not in,62
NA,"training or employment and that they face a bleak financial future-a future with hardship,",62
NA,"increased likelihood of health and mental health issues, and an increased probability of",62
NA,involvement in the criminal justice system.,62
NA,"As our population ages, it is imperative for Australia's economic productivity and the well-",62
NA,being of society more generally that we equip all young people with the skills and support,62
NA,"needed to become active, positive, contributing citizens. Young people who are unemployed",62
NA,for a prolonged period of time suffer wage scarring. The effect of wage scarring can be long-,62
NA,lasting and financially and emotionally detrimental. A recent international study from the,62
NA,Work Foundation in the United Kingdom indicated that long periods of unemployment when,62
NA,young can reduce an individual's wage-earning capacity between 13 and 23 percent by the age,62
NA,of 42. This phenomena negatively affects not only a person's individual financial ability but,62
NA,"the nation's collective fiscal productivity. Therefore, I do commend the government for",62
NA,pressing ahead with the idea of systematically linking youth job seekers with work-trial,62
NA,"opportunities and paid employment. It is a fundamentally good idea. But, like any idea, it also",62
NA,needs to be implemented well to make it work. It is from this standpoint that I offer a,62
NA,"constructive critique of this bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs",62
NA,"Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016.",62
NA,My first observation when reading through the bill is that there is little detail on how the,62
NA,"Prepare, Trial, Hire program-the PaTH program-will operate in practice. Much is left to",62
NA,regulation and administrative discretion. I understand the advantages of retaining flexibility,62
NA,when implementing a program like this. You want it to be able to adapt as conditions change,62
NA,and to leave room to incorporate improvements when lessons from its implementation are,62
NA,"learned. However, too many fundamental questions remain unanswered in the bill and several",62
NA,important protections for young people are omitted.,62
NA,"For a start, it is not sufficiently clear how young job seekers will be insured while they are",62
NA,on their placements. WorkCover-style entitlements that insure young people against accidents,62
NA,NA,62
NA,"in the workplace are a fundamental workplace right, and my Senate colleagues will find it",63
NA,hard to support any final version of the bill without such protections.,63
NA,"The term 'internship', which is used in the bill, should be revisited. It conjures up images of",63
NA,making coffees for bosses in the offices of lawyers and accountants when most job seekers,63
NA,"will be going down a very different, practical and vocational-skills-and-trades pathway. 'Work",63
NA,trial' would be a much more encompassing and meaningful expression to be used and would,63
NA,also highlight that the placements are intended to lead participants into work. Work health and,63
NA,"safety requirements, including bullying and sexual harassment protections, must also exist to",63
NA,complement the WorkCover-style entitlements that are required.,63
NA,The amount of and timing of the subsidy received by business to take on a young person,63
NA,must also be clearer so as to understand exactly how the incentives will work for business. In,63
NA,"particular, we need to know whether those incentives may become perverse if the churning of",63
NA,interns can work to a business advantage. Churning would be an unintended and perverse,63
NA,"outcome, and would not be to the benefit of either the young participants or to existing",63
NA,employees who find their jobs being displaced by a readily available pool of subsidised,63
NA,labour.,63
NA,"The lowest-skilled workplaces are particularly vulnerable to such churning, as young job",63
NA,"seekers are generally less skilled and would, therefore, compete directly with other employees",63
NA,"in a low-skilled workplace. Similarly, we also need to know that young participants are not",63
NA,displacing their own jobs. We need to know that businesses that employ a lot of young,63
NA,"people, like MCDonald's or a retail chain, cannot access young labour that simply replaces a",63
NA,significant chunk of their pre-existing workforce. It is for this reason that the Nick Xenophon,63
NA,team will seek to work with the government to ensure that appropriate industries are targeted,63
NA,"for the PaTH program and that, where internship experiences are meaningful and do not",63
NA,"displace existing labour, they genuinely facilitate a transition to ongoing employment. We",63
NA,cannot have a program that it is simply open slather and leaves young people open to,63
NA,"exploitation. Between 2012 and 2015, NCVER recorded that the Australian economy lost",63
NA,"almost 160,000 trainees and apprentices. We should, therefore, be targeting trades and the",63
NA,"construction industry, and be, primarily, promoting this initiative to Australian small",63
NA,businesses. This will reduce the risk of churning by big business.,63
NA,The range of reasonable excuses for a young job seeker to end their internship early needs,63
NA,"to be expanded. Currently, it does not appear that the legislation allows for a young person to",63
NA,terminate their internship for judicious reasons such as for sickness or for compassionate,63
NA,"grounds, such as the death of a close family member. That, surely, must be amended.",63
NA,"Furthermore, the definition of 'misconduct'-currently grounds for early termination of the",63
NA,internship-needs to be clarified in the legislation to avoid perverse incentives for business,63
NA,"and to protect young people. For example, what level of proof is required for misconduct to",63
NA,be proven? Or is it just the word of the business owner versus the intern? Given the clear,63
NA,"power imbalances between business and a young job seeker, there needs to be a clear and",63
NA,"reasonable standard of proof defined in the legislation. To complement this, a complaints",63
NA,system needs to be established so that young people can access it if they become exploited. I,63
NA,am concerned that without such legislative protections and oversight we risk the cultivation of,63
NA,"the Dickensian master-servant relationships, echoed in the 19th century.",63
NA,NA,63
NA,There needs to be adequate resourcing for jobactive providers so that they can effectively,64
NA,negotiate placements with businesses and support internship participation. An additional,64
NA,question is whether jobactive or Transition to Work providers are better placed to house the,64
NA,PaTH program. I would argue that Transition to Work contract providers are a better fit as the,64
NA,government has a collective of organisations in Transition to Work that have proven specialist,64
NA,experience in delivering employment and transition support to young people.,64
NA,The proposed bill currently excludes related entities from being able to deliver the 'prepare',64
NA,"phase of the PaTH program. In practical terms, this means that a provider that is both an RTO,",64
NA,"a registered training organisation, and a jobactive provider will not be able to refer jobseekers",64
NA,from its own caseload to its own RTO to complete employability skills training. This runs,64
NA,counter to the notion of creating integrated services to prevent service gaps and will create,64
NA,"particular problems in regional areas, where few providers are readily accessible. One",64
NA,possible remedy might be to exempt not-for-profit providers from the related entities rule.,64
NA,One hundred dollars a week is very little to be paying an intern when their prospective,64
NA,employer is being paid a multithousand dollar subsidy to take them on and help them into,64
NA,"employment. The balance of incentives needs to be much more fairly weighted. Furthermore,",64
NA,"in rural communities, $100 may be barely sufficient to cover the cost of running a car-",64
NA,remember that in communities such as mine there are few buses. The dollars offered would,64
NA,not cover the long drives that are required to even attend a program.,64
NA,A work-trial style program like PaTH is only the beginning of the work the government,64
NA,needs to do in the young jobseeker space. The economic burden for Australian society and,64
NA,government as a result of youth inactivity and poor transitions is substantial. A national youth,64
NA,activation and transition service targeted towards young people who are not engaged in,64
NA,"education, employment or training and who have multiple barriers would contribute to",64
NA,reducing this burden and increasing the productivity of the nation as a whole. For many young,64
NA,"people who have had experiences of employment, those experiences have been temporary in",64
NA,nature. The Australian government Productivity Commission working paper Prevalence of,64
NA,transition pathways in Australia recognised that many young people frequently 'churn' in and,64
NA,out of the labour force. One of the main reasons for this is the casual or temporary nature of,64
NA,the majority of their employment opportunities. There is an urgent and compelling need for a,64
NA,youth activation and transition service to exist for disengaged young people to ensure that,64
NA,they successfully transition into stable employment or further training. The current jobactive,64
NA,service does not provide the specialist support needed for young people to successfully,64
NA,"transition to sustainable employment, particularly young people who face complex non-",64
NA,"vocational barriers, and yet those young people, who are the most vulnerable with the highest",64
NA,barriers to overcome-the stream C young people-are not in the youth transition service but,64
NA,"in the adult transitional employment service, jobactive. It does not make sense. Of those",64
NA,"young people, we know that many are not 'employment ready' after they leave school,",64
NA,particularly young people who did not experience a solid secondary education. For those,64
NA,"young people, the opportunity to connect with vocational or pre-employment education and",64
NA,training needs to coincide with intensive support to address non-vocational barriers through,64
NA,"the development of an individual plan with mutually agreed specific steps to address barriers,",64
NA,to identify and develop personal strengths and to reach goals. This level of support is the best,64
NA,way to create a foundation for future employability. International experience suggests that,64
NA,NA,64
NA,such rapid activation of young people who are not in education or employment provides the,65
NA,greatest opportunity for a positive outcome. Such a national plan should be delivered as a,65
NA,"specialised youth service, it should adopt a place based approach and it should be delivered by",65
NA,"local community services. This is especially the case in regional and remote communities,",65
NA,where local delivery by providers allows for the flexibility to tailor the service to specific,65
NA,community needs and is integral to successful delivery.,65
NA,"Addressing the needs of young people who are unemployed, underemployed or inactive is",65
NA,equitably responsible and would be fiscally advantageous to the Australian government,65
NA,"through the implementation of cost-effective, preventative activation programs that will",65
NA,ultimately reduce long-term dependence on welfare and increase Australia's productivity.,65
NA,"I and my colleagues do commend the idea behind the bill before us, but adequate",65
NA,safeguards would also need to be legislated in order to make it work in practice. It also must,65
NA,be understood that a workable program for young jobseekers is but a first step in engaging,65
NA,"young people transitioning towards employment. I will support the bill in this House, but I",65
NA,acknowledge that my colleagues in the Senate reserve the right to propose amendments,65
NA,relating to what I have spoken on today.,65
NA,"I want to finish by telling you a story of a young person from my electorate, who served me",65
NA,at a checkout in the supermarket just a couple of weeks ago. This young man graduated with a,65
NA,"bachelor's degree in science majoring in geology and ecology, and went on to study honours",65
NA,in environmental biology at the University of Adelaide. He is now in his first year out of,65
NA,"university and has struggled to obtain even an interview for an environmental job, not just in",65
NA,South Australia but also interstate. He has also emailed a lot of companies explaining his,65
NA,"interest in doing work experience or vacation work, but most employers will not take on work",65
NA,"experience students. For every graduate or entry-level job he has applied for, the employer",65
NA,requires years of experience. As the young man described it to me: 'It's a never-ending cycle.,65
NA,"If employers don't want work experience students, how are we supposed to get the experience",65
NA,in the first place? It's an issue of not just experience but also the sheer number of applicants,65
NA,"for the jobs.' One job he went for, a graduate-level environmental officer position, had over",65
NA,"200 applicants, and this level of competition was not unusual. Of the group of about 20 to 30",65
NA,"talented students who graduated with honours with this young man last year, only 10 per cent",65
NA,have obtained full-time work in their area of specialisation and most have resorted to working,65
NA,in a supermarket and the like.,65
NA,"Young people, just like the rest of the population, want to build a good life for themselves.",65
NA,"Currently, our society is failing to provide the jobs for our next generation of workers to get",65
NA,"their start. As we do that, we will continue to fail our young people and we will fail Australia.",65
NA,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (12:29): I rise to contribute to this debate on the,65
NA,"Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016",65
NA,because it is an essential debate to be had in this place insofar as providing opportunities for,65
NA,young people in this country to find work is concerned. I start by commending the,65
NA,contribution by the member for Mayo. I think her concerns about the bill are absolutely,65
NA,correct. The intent of the bill-at least if it is to ensure the opportunity of young people to get,65
NA,"work-is noble and good, but, as always, we need to look at the impact of the legislation and",65
NA,whether in fact there are sufficient safeguards in place for the most vulnerable workers in the,65
NA,"labour market, namely young people.",65
NA,NA,65
NA,"I also think it is true to say that there is no point providing a subsidised program, if you do",66
NA,not understand the challenges confronting young people. The member for Mayo went to the,66
NA,issue of non-vocational barriers to employment-the fact that there are so many young people,66
NA,who are not only not equipped with skills to deal with the labour market and find a job but,66
NA,"also dealing with so many other barriers, including homelessness, intergenerational",66
NA,"unemployment, drug dependency and all sorts of other difficulties. Whatever we do in",66
NA,supporting those on the margins-young people struggling-we need to ensure that we attend,66
NA,"to them in a holistic manner; not only providing a job, in the case of people who might be",66
NA,"struggling, but also attending to their other concerns so we can make sure that their",66
NA,attachment to the labour market is not a precarious one.,66
NA,Labor supports opportunities for young people. We are concerned that there are in excess,66
NA,"of 260,000 young people unemployed in Australia, and that is a very significant proportion of",66
NA,"the unemployment numbers in this country. We know, as the result of automation and other",66
NA,"changes in the labour market, there are fewer entry-level jobs for younger people. Therefore",66
NA,the government does have a role to partner businesses and partner companies to ensure we,66
NA,"provide greater opportunities. We also know, because of the disruption to other sectors of the",66
NA,"labour market, we have a situation where young people now are competing against older",66
NA,workers for the same jobs. There was a time when fast-food chains probably employed,66
NA,"predominantly young people. That still may be the case but, increasingly, we are seeing older",66
NA,workers having to take on fast-food work because they have been displaced from other sectors,66
NA,of the labour market. This adds to the difficulty young people are having finding work at the,66
NA,moment.,66
NA,"We support the tenor of the bill, but we have some grave reservations. The member for",66
NA,Chifley has moved a very significant amendment that goes to the concerns that Labor has in,66
NA,"relation to this bill. The night of the budget, when it was introduced by the Treasurer and later",66
NA,"advocated by the Minister for Employment, was the first indication we had in relation to this",66
NA,"proposed initiative that it would only apply to existing jobs. In fact, when asked whether it",66
NA,"would apply to additional jobs or existing jobs, the Minister for Employment advised that it",66
NA,"would only apply to existing jobs and then, of course, subsequently had to correct the record",66
NA,"and say, 'No, it could include additional jobs as well.' That is a fundamental concern we have",66
NA,with respect to this initiative.,66
NA,There is a concern that we are using tax payers' dollars to subsidise jobs that were going to,66
NA,"be provided to young people anyway. If the minister needs to get a lesson on deadweight loss,",66
NA,she only need look at the weakness of this scheme. The way that the scheme has been set up,66
NA,"will allow employers to use it to ensure there is no additionality to the labour market and,",66
NA,"indeed, allow them to employ young people in existing positions, thereby avoiding having to",66
NA,"fully pay for their own workers and, of course, not having to pay them pursuant to industrial",66
NA,"instruments. There is a twofold problem here: firstly, the taxpayer will be paying for these so-",66
NA,"called interns for work they were going to employ someone for anyway, but now they are",66
NA,"getting a subsidy from the taxpayer; and, secondly, they do not have to ensure it is additional",66
NA,"to the workforce. That is a concern, and it has been catered for in the amendment moved by",66
NA,"the member for Chifley, where we want to get some guarantees as to this initiative.",66
NA,We do not have to go too far back to remember what this government was considering,66
NA,doing to young jobseekers. It was not when long ago that the government was looking at,66
NA,NA,66
NA,cutting any benefit whatsoever for all jobseekers up to the age of 30 from any support for six,67
NA,months. This government advocated that young people up until the age of 30 would receive,67
NA,no support for six months even when they were looking each and every day for work.,67
NA,"Because of the pressure from Labor and others, that has now been reduced to one month, but I",67
NA,"can tell you that for young people who are independent people looking for work, if they are",67
NA,not to receive any support for the first month they are unemployed and they are not living at,67
NA,"home, it is an enormous burden and it is counterproductive. It will be more difficult where",67
NA,there is no support whatsoever for young people to look for work.,67
NA,"We ask the government, as they ended up backflipping on the six-month suspension of any",67
NA,"support, to also change their position on the one-month suspension and provide some level of",67
NA,"support, provided the young jobseeker is looking for work. That is what mutual obligation",67
NA,"means. You cannot have the principle of mutual obligation when you say, 'There's an",67
NA,"obligation on the young jobseeker to look for work, but there is no obligation on us to help",67
NA,them.' That is not mutual obligation. That is just putting the onus on them with no support,67
NA,"from the government, and that is completely undermining the principle of mutual obligation",67
NA,that I thought both major parties shared in that regard. I ask the government to reconsider,67
NA,their position on the absence of support for one month so that they are not being unduly,67
NA,unfair.,67
NA,"While I am on my feet, in relation to support from government, they also extended the",67
NA,"youth allowance to cover 22and 23-year-olds so there would be, in effect, a 20 per cent cut,",67
NA,"in real terms, to income support for unemployed young people at the age of 22 and 23. That is",67
NA,still something the government is seeking to pass through the Senate. It is a massive cut. If,67
NA,"you are on Newstart, on the lowest support-we know Newstart is not a very significant",67
NA,"income-you are going to be subject to a 20 per cent cut to that income, if you are 22 or 23,",67
NA,"Again, that is a pretty harsh thing to do to that age cohort, and we would ask the government",67
NA,to reconsider its position there. It is pretty harsh stuff. It is not going to help them find work.,67
NA,"It is going to make it more difficult. It is just gratuitously punitive and, quite frankly, quite",67
NA,"nasty, but in keeping with this sort of government.",67
NA,This government wants to have a society that is easy to hire and easy to fire. That is liberal,67
NA,"philosophy, quite frankly-let the market rip, undermine the safety net, go after penalty rates,",67
NA,"find ways to displace workers in the labour market, undermine employment security, diminish",67
NA,"the conditions of employment, and smash unions so that there is little collective bargaining",67
NA,happening in the labour market. That is pretty much the modus operandi of the Liberal Party.,67
NA,Given that the aspiration of Prime Minister Turnbull and this government is to have an easy-,67
NA,"to-hire, easy-to-fire, low-wage society, we are concerned that this initiative, even if it is well-",67
NA,"intended, could actually lead to that result. Therefore, I think the government should seriously",67
NA,contemplate the amendment moved by the member for Chifley. I will just go to some of those,67
NA,points.,67
NA,The member for Chifley has made clear that the opposition is not declining to agree to the,67
NA,"second reading of this bill, but we are concerned about a number of key areas. Firstly, we are",67
NA,concerned that the jobs will not be displaced by cheaper labour. I have mentioned the fact that,67
NA,"with this scheme, by being able to replace existing workers, rather than it involving additional",67
NA,"jobs and an increase in the number of jobs available for young people in the labour market,",67
NA,we are concerned that if you have these so-called interns coming into workplaces on income,67
NA,NA,67
NA,that is less than the award that applies to that workplace you are effectively undermining the,68
NA,existing arrangements in that workplace. It is the classic race to the bottom method used by,68
NA,"reactionary right-wing governments, and we would be concerned that this initiative will",68
NA,"actually apply in that way. So, quite rightly, the member for Chifley has said that we need to",68
NA,be given some assurance that that would not take place as a result of the efforts of this,68
NA,initiative.,68
NA,Our further concern is that wages will not be undercut and some participants will be paid,68
NA,below award minimum wages. That is specifically referring to the failure to recognise awards,68
NA,"in the workplace. Further, that participants' safety will not be compromised and that adequate",68
NA,"insurance arrangements will be provided. Again, because this class of jobseekers will not be",68
NA,"strictly identified as employees, they will not be covered by the workers compensation",68
NA,schemes that apply to actual workers. It would be very concerning to Labor if there were not,68
NA,"sufficient support to provide some other means to ensure not only their safety but, indeed,",68
NA,provide compensation if they are injured at work.,68
NA,"Given that this scheme is effectively going right across the labour market, dealing with",68
NA,"private sector companies, we are concerned that there is a possibility that these young people",68
NA,"will be in unsafe situations where they will be at risk of injury, or worse. The member for",68
NA,Chifley may have already mentioned that we recently saw the tragic death of a very young,68
NA,participant on a Work for the Dole scheme in Toowoomba. It was an absolute tragedy and I,68
NA,"know everyone in this place has that view. We say that when it, in particular, comes to young",68
NA,"people in workplaces who do not have a great deal of experience, and given that this can go",68
NA,"across so many sectors of the labour market, we do really need to ensure that we go above and",68
NA,beyond in providing safety and that in the induction of young people into these workplaces,68
NA,there is sufficient training for them to understand the potential risks. I am not aware that that,68
NA,"will not happen, but there is no clarity from the bill suggesting that it will happen. Labor is",68
NA,insisting that we get some undertaking from the government that the safety of these young,68
NA,people has been taken into consideration.,68
NA,Too many deaths are occurring in workplaces in this country. Three weeks ago a German,68
NA,"backpacker was on the 14th floor of a building site in Perth and fell to her death, tragically.",68
NA,"That is just one of many examples that can happen if young people, or workers generally, are",68
NA,not given sufficient safety training. We need to make sure that happens.,68
NA,Another concern is that participants will not be used to help businesses sidestep unfair,68
NA,"dismissal protections. That goes to our concern that, increasingly, people feel so little security",68
NA,of work. We would be worried about the vulnerability of workers if employers were able to,68
NA,obviate their responsibilities and not provide sufficient protection for those participants.,68
NA,We have talked about prioritising small and medium enterprises. We do not want to see,68
NA,wholesale use of this scheme by large employers just as a mechanism to displace workers,68
NA,who are being paid under an award. Any scheme that involves taxpayers' dollars to subsidise,68
NA,"wages should be about adding to the labour market, not taxpayers subsidising under-award-",68
NA,"wage jobs. That is not what this bill should be about. Yet, when you read the bill, there is no",68
NA,"clarity-none on security of employment, none on safety and not sufficiently on insurance, if",68
NA,compensation is required when there is an injury. There are so many questions requiring,68
NA,"answers from the government, which I think are very appropriately determined through our",68
NA,NA,68
NA,amendment. Until we get some clarity we have not made our position fully known on this. We,69
NA,ask the government to take these issues very seriously.,69
NA,Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (12:44): I rise today to speak about the Social Security,69
NA,"Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. The Turnbull",69
NA,"government's prepare, trial, hire program, or PaTH as it is known, is a program that is",69
NA,supposed to prepare young people for work by placing them in voluntary internships for,69
NA,between four and 12 weeks. This bill is designed in part to support the introduction of PaTH.,69
NA,I am particularly interested in the issues surrounding getting young people to work. I,69
NA,represent the electorate of Brand where pockets of the community are struggling with youth,69
NA,unemployment figures that stand at a staggering 13.6 per cent. This is more than double the,69
NA,national unemployment rate average. This is despite the electorate being home to Western,69
NA,"Australia's major industrial strip in Kwinana-home to big and small businesses, from Co-",69
NA,"operative Bulk Handling, Alcoa and BP to smaller fabricators and contractors. Supporting this",69
NA,"state and the nation during the construction phase of the mining boom, job seekers in WA and",69
NA,"Brand are now having to look elsewhere, beyond the Kwinana strip, to find work now the",69
NA,mining industry has moved into its foreseeable production phase. The move into this phase,69
NA,was always foreseeable. There was no surprise with this movement of phases. It was plain to,69
NA,see for all. The construction boom in the mining industry of Western Australia could not last,69
NA,forever.,69
NA,The government-I might say the state government of Western Australia as well as the,69
NA,federal government here-has had a long time to consider the impact of this economic change,69
NA,"on communities in Brand, in Western Australia and across the whole country. This",69
NA,"government has used its time to come up with, and endlessly repeat, a slogan to address the",69
NA,"unemployment rate-'jobs and growth', they say. It seems to be a big useless loop. I am",69
NA,concerned that PaTH is a cobbled together program that will not provide realistic,69
NA,opportunities for young unemployed people. I am concerned that it will not address the lack,69
NA,of jobs available to young people and will instead fail young job seekers.,69
NA,Let us have a look at what PaTH is. It is supposedly designed to prepare young people for,69
NA,work by providing job seekers aged 17 to 24 with pre-employment training and placement in,69
NA,"voluntary internships over four to 12 weeks. Businesses will be paid $1,000 to take on an",69
NA,"intern and then receive a wage subsidy of between $6½ thousand and $10,000 if they hire",69
NA,them at the conclusion of the internship. During that time interns may work 15 to 25 hours a,69
NA,"week. In return, job seekers will receive payments of $200 per fortnight on top of their current",69
NA,income support payments while they are participating in the PaTH program. The program is,69
NA,"being introduced at the same time the other government job programs, such as the Work for",69
NA,"the Dole scheme, are hopelessly failing our young unemployed.",69
NA,I see and hear regularly from my constituents who are worried about their children that are,69
NA,unable to find meaningful work and with little prospect of meaningful work in the near future.,69
NA,"I hear concerns from young people themselves who want to work but have no job, and this is",69
NA,"not from lack of trying. Of course, the reality is that when there are less jobs than there are job",69
NA,seekers people will remain unemployed. This is a sentiment that has been shared with me by,69
NA,"people in the jobs service industry, who have expressed their frustrations at a lack of jobs for",69
NA,people to apply for.,69
NA,NA,69
NA,The Kwinana strip has been a major source of jobs for people living in Rockingham and,70
NA,"Kwinana-the two cities within Brand-for many decades. Recently, on a visit to a local job",70
NA,"service provider in Kwinana, with the member for Chifley, I was told by these people",70
NA,working on the frontline trying to help people find work that the jobs that were once so,70
NA,"plentiful on the strip, as it is known, have now dried up. The jobs for those people who want",70
NA,to work are just not there.,70
NA,Youth unemployment in parts of Brand stands at more than double the national,70
NA,"unemployment average, as I have mentioned before. I repeat it because the figures are",70
NA,astounding. What happened to the jobs and growth mantra espoused by the government,70
NA,during the election? Where are these jobs? Where is the investment needed to get people back,70
NA,into meaningful employment? The sad truth is that Australia's youth are counting the cost of,70
NA,the Turnbull government's failure to develop a real jobs plan for the future and a real,70
NA,sustainable jobs plan for our nation.,70
NA,In Brand and across the country we are seeing a government that is not willing to invest in,70
NA,their future by investing in the productive infrastructure that can deliver real opportunities and,70
NA,benefits to the community. One glaring example of this failure in my electorate comes to,70
NA,mind as I consider this bill: the Kwinana outer harbour. I know members of this place will,70
NA,have heard me mention the Kwinana outer project often. It is one of those nation-changing,70
NA,and certainly electorate-changing-not to mention state-changing-infrastructure projects.,70
NA,"Instead of progressing the construction of the Kwinana outer harbour project, the Turnbull",70
NA,"government is pursuing a $2 billion investment in the Perth Freight Link, a road to a port",70
NA,which is fast approaching the day when it will reach full capacity and even then the road,70
NA,"proposed does not even make it to the port. In fact, it stops about two kilometres south of the",70
NA,"port. An alternative investment by the government, an investment in the Kwinana outer",70
NA,harbour project-a long-term investment in a long-term future-would instead unlock latent,70
NA,potential across existing industries and attract new industries into the area.,70
NA,"Support for the new outer harbour makes sense. It would help grow the local, state and",70
NA,"national economies. It is estimated it would create 25,000 new jobs. That is a lot of",70
NA,employment opportunities for our young people. It would provide real paid jobs and training;,70
NA,not short-term internships off the back of a hastily put together program. The Kwinana outer,70
NA,harbour project would encourage innovation through the application of modern technology to,70
NA,"port operations, and it puts people first by supporting a sustainable industrial base to underpin",70
NA,the flourishing communities in Brand. Such investment would create job opportunities that,70
NA,"would give young people an employment future, and a long-term employment future. It",70
NA,would open up opportunities for new and developing industry to move into Kwinana to,70
NA,expand the large industrial estate that has been planned for there for many years. These new,70
NA,industries would be located next to a state-of-the-art export port.,70
NA,"Despite promising that it would tackle youth unemployment, the coalition has failed to",70
NA,deliver on the means and ends of actually doing so. According to the Department of,70
NA,"Employment, youth unemployment nationally is at 12.8 per cent with nearly 300,000",70
NA,unemployed young people between the ages of 15 and 24 unable to have productive work,70
NA,"lives. On top of this, the department acknowledges there are another 170,000 people who",70
NA,have been unemployed for more than a year. We have a generation of young people who are,70
NA,disillusioned by the act of looking for jobs that simply are not there. It is a national disgrace.,70
NA,NA,70
NA,"Against the backdrop of this woeful performance, the Turnbull government has pulled",71
NA,"together the PaTH program. I am concerned, as are many of my colleagues, that PaTH will",71
NA,not be a pathway to meaningful employment opportunities and will simply result in young,71
NA,people being exploited. We already know that the Work for the Dole program is not providing,71
NA,long-term solutions for young people. It is failing our young unemployed. In the case of Work,71
NA,"for the Dole, even the government's own figures show nearly 90 per cent of its participants are",71
NA,not in full-time work three months after finishing the program. You would think that these,71
NA,"results would cause a re-think on performance of this program, but, no, as we have heard from",71
NA,"my colleague the member for Chifley, the response from the government was astounding.",71
NA,"And I will repeat the response which was heard at last month's Senate estimates, 'The purpose",71
NA,of Work for the Dole is not necessarily to lead directly to a full-time job.',71
NA,It is no wonder that the failure of this program and the attitude towards young people trying,71
NA,to find work causes me to have concerns about this new plan proposed by the government. As,71
NA,"you have heard from my colleagues who have spoken already on this bill, they and many",71
NA,others in the community are worried about whether the program represents a fair deal for,71
NA,"Australia's young jobseekers. Under the PaTH program, we are concerned that young people",71
NA,will be forced to pay an even heavier price through the program's apparent flaws.,71
NA,This bill is designed to provide support to participants' social security entitlements while in,71
NA,"the program. It does this via two measures. Firstly, a provision will be inserted into the Social",71
NA,Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act so that the $200 payment interns receive is,71
NA,"not counted as income for social security or veterans' entitlements purposes. And, secondly, it",71
NA,amends the Social Security Act to allow young people to suspend their payments if they are,71
NA,indeed employed-against all odds. They can then restart them without re-applying if they,71
NA,lose their job through no fault of their own within 26 weeks.,71
NA,"Now, if taken in isolation the government will claim the measures in the bill are",71
NA,"noncontroversial and should be accepted. However, a closer look shows us that the reality is",71
NA,very different and that our concerns are justified. We are concerned at what the future might,71
NA,hold for young people who are at a most important stage in life as they look to enter the,71
NA,workforce and as they look to prepare for the rest of their lives. The reality is that the,71
NA,measures proposed by the government form part of a broader new program design which,71
NA,could see young jobseekers exploited. I agree with the proposition that there is dignity in,71
NA,"work, but there is not much dignity if you are the victim of exploitation. The measures could",71
NA,"undermine workforce standards, which would have an even broader impact on the wider",71
NA,community and those already in employment.,71
NA,"Perhaps most alarming is the fact that, unlike with Work for the Dole, for the first time",71
NA,participants would be placed in the private sector and would be paid below award wages. The,71
NA,Work for the Dole program is not-for-profitand government-organisation based. PaTH,71
NA,places young people into businesses. This means private businesses will be given access to,71
NA,thousands of young Australians who will work for the benefit of business for less than the,71
NA,"minimum wage. The implications of this are obviously concerning and again, impacts on",71
NA,more people than those participating in the PaTH program itself. PaTH has the potential to be,71
NA,used to displace jobs with cheap labour. Families do not want to see their children used in this,71
NA,way. Young people do not want to be used in this way and workers do not want to be usurped,71
NA,out of their jobs by a cheaper and potentially untrained labour source.,71
NA,NA,71
NA,In this country we have a minimum wage overseen by the Fair Work Commission. This is,72
NA,"something to be proud of. However, with PaTH there are very real concerns raised that",72
NA,participants may be entering a program where they are 'working' for below minimum award,72
NA,"wages. The program could very well see young Australians doing the same job as others,",72
NA,"except being paid less than the minimum wage. It is a dangerous path to take and, as the",72
NA,"member for Burt said, it is a dangerous race to the bottom.",72
NA,The reality is that we are experiencing a time in this country where wages growth is at the,72
NA,"lowest rate on record. My colleagues' concern, and my concern, is that PaTH could be used to",72
NA,"undermine wages across industries, and this concern is very real. Not only is it worrying to",72
NA,"young people who potentially will be paid below award wages, and not only is it worrying to",72
NA,their families and loved ones who will potentially watch them work for less than they deserve,72
NA,"and for less than an award wage, but it will also be worrying to workers and employees who",72
NA,could see underpaid PaTH interns doing their work and taking their jobs. In such cases there,72
NA,"would be two victims: the underpaid intern and the person who, sadly, loses their job to them.",72
NA,Large numbers of interns could completely remove the need for existing employees to work at,72
NA,"certain times in certain sectors, including hospitality and tourism. Who is to say that large",72
NA,"numbers of PaTH participants would not be used over weekends, removing the need for",72
NA,regular employees at those times and also removing the need to pay penalty rates for those,72
NA,employees?,72
NA,"This is counterproductive, and could potentially add to the problem of underemployment in",72
NA,"the community. Underemployment, as we all know, is a massive concern, with people",72
NA,struggling to find enough work to pay the bills and to keep their heads above water. It is a,72
NA,time where they are seeking more hours and greater employment. There are 1.1 million,72
NA,"Australians wanting more work, but unable to find it, and underemployment in the August",72
NA,"quarter was at 8.7 per cent, the highest level since this data began in 1978. In these",72
NA,circumstances it would be irresponsible to support a program that has the very real potential,72
NA,of adding to this problem and to people's hardships.,72
NA,Another concern is that despite repeated questioning there are few assurances that interns,72
NA,will be covered by appropriate workers compensation schemes should there be an accident.,72
NA,"That is because PaTH participants will be considered as 'volunteers', not as employees. This is",72
NA,"despite the fact they will be doing jobs and will get paid, albeit a below award amount. This is",72
NA,"farcical and it is a clear demonstration of exploitation. It is damaging, because in some",72
NA,jurisdictions this could affect the way workers compensation systems would treat participants,72
NA,in the event of an accident-which may well be a life-changing accident.,72
NA,There are no specifics about the program: there is no detail on areas where jobseekers will,72
NA,acquire skills. The program has been touted as a means to prepare young people for work,72
NA,"during these times of high youth unemployment, but there is very little in the way of detail in",72
NA,"the way it will be implemented. In fact, while the program was announced in May and is",72
NA,scheduled to start next April the government cannot even tell us what an 'intern' is. In Senate,72
NA,estimates back in May the clearest outline of training and skills outcomes Minister Cash,72
NA,"offered us was, 'We will give you the skills that employers tell us you just do not have.'",72
NA,The government has also had trouble explaining what jobseekers will be doing in the,72
NA,internship phase of the program-whether they would be working or just observing. To say,72
NA,that this is a vague outcome for participants would be an understatement. It leaves them with,72
NA,NA,72
NA,"little scope to plan, to achieve or to develop in their work experiences. I and my colleagues",73
NA,are also concerned that large numbers of participants could be used within companies at any,73
NA,"given time, with little sanction applied to employers that might 'churn' through participants as",73
NA,their engagement concludes. We do not know if this will happen.,73
NA,The lack of information around this program and the problems not only for participants but,73
NA,"for the wider community mean we cannot agree to this legislation at the moment, without",73
NA,amendment. The government needs to show how these issues will be fixed and addressed. We,73
NA,call-Labor is calling-for this legislation to be considered by a Senate inquiry. We would be,73
NA,doing a disservice to young jobseekers if we just agreed to PaTH and to this legislation,73
NA,without amendment. We would be doing a disservice to those workers who potentially would,73
NA,have their jobs undermined by this program.,73
NA,"The government's failure to invest in jobs and in infrastructure that will provide jobs,",73
NA,cannot be hidden behind a poorly-put-together program such as the PaTH program. The,73
NA,government must address the concerns raised against this hastily-put-together internship,73
NA,"program, and Labor demands a better deal than this for young jobseekers.",73
Ms RYAN ,Lalor-Opposition Whip) (12:59): I rise to support the amendment by the,73
NA,member for Chifley and to discuss this program that has been put forward by the government,73
NA,"in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill",73
NA,2016. It seems to me that this is a creative concoction. They have come up with the word,73
NA,"'PaTH' for a path, supposedly, to somewhere, and then they have thought, 'Prepare, Trial,",73
NA,Hire'. It is a clever little idea. There is only one problem: we have all seen The Pursuit of,73
NA,Happyness. We saw the film. We saw Will Smith being homeless while he worked for,73
NA,nothing with his young child with him. We have seen the film. We know that the glorified,73
NA,"internship is a very, very sexy word that people use for unpaid work, unless there is a quid pro",73
NA,quo in terms of some kind of an accreditation.,73
NA,"An internship in this country is not tightly defined. We do, however, use the word to",73
NA,describe what RMIT students might do as part of their practical placement for which they are,73
NA,given accreditation in their postgrad study. ANU runs similar programs. There is a quid pro,73
NA,quo here. The young person attends a workplace in a learning environment to do a work,73
NA,placement. We even use that language of 'work placement' in high school with VET,73
NA,programs. There is always a quid pro quo.,73
NA,"The problem with this plan is that it is called an internship, but there is no quid pro quo.",73
NA,The notion here is that we are just going to roll out a policy so that we can pay kids $100 a,73
NA,week on top of what they get for Newstart and they will actually be working. Or are they,73
NA,working? This is the least thought-out piece of legislation from those opposite to come into,73
NA,"this place in 3½ years, and it is the worst. Worse than that, it is packaged like it is some kind",73
NA,of panacea for youth unemployment. There is no panacea for youth unemployment. There is,73
NA,no quick fix and there is no easy fix. We have tried these things before and they have been,73
NA,dropped. Why? Because they were not successful.,73
NA,"As a young person, when I first left school at 16 I was part of a program that came out of",73
NA,"what we now call Centrelink, which used to be something very different. We were put into",73
NA,positions that were three-month trials where the government subsidised the employer to put,73
NA,those young people into those jobs. I was in a job for 12 months and I watched four other,73
NA,"young people come and go in three-month blocks and get no ongoing employment. In our era,",73
NA,NA,73
NA,I talked to lots of young people who were just going from three-month position to three-,74
NA,month position to three-month position. What we did was subsidise business. What we did not,74
NA,do was find long-term jobs for young people.,74
NA,"This is just another iteration of that, although this time it is dressed up as if it is more",74
NA,important. This is not about putting someone into a low-paid entry-level job where they may,74
NA,not even require a school finishing certificate or year 12 qualification. This is being dressed,74
NA,up like it is some kind of postgrad experience. It is not. This is about exploiting young people,74
NA,and finding yet another way to subsidise business. If they cannot get their $50 billion tax cuts,74
NA,"through, I suppose this was the next best thing. They are going to subsidise business and wrap",74
NA,it up like it is going to address youth unemployment. It is not.,74
NA,"As we saw in The Pursuit of Happyness, the American version of an internship is unpaid",74
NA,postgrad work. That movie blew apart any notion that internships are necessarily a way to get,74
NA,"to work. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you remember Will Smith in that movie-I certainly do-you",74
NA,"will remember him sleeping in a public toilet with his son. If you remember, that model that",74
NA,the movie exposed was where American companies-I think it was a law firm or an,74
NA,accountancy firm-would put on 10 interns who would do unpaid work and would ultimately,74
NA,"vie for one paid position. It was not funny. The movie was incredibly sad, and so is this",74
NA,"proposal which came down on budget night. The minister responsible, when asked, 'Is this",74
NA,"about new jobs or existing jobs?' said, 'It's about existing jobs.' It is about existing jobs, so it is",74
NA,"about reducing the wages of young people as they enter employment-well, quasi-",74
NA,"employment or possible employment. Perhaps one in 1,000 will get a job out of this program.",74
NA,I have found this entire idea to be completely and utterly fanciful. It is absolutely fanciful.,74
NA,There are so many other questions that come from it. Will they get a payslip? It is illegal in,74
NA,this country not to give a worker a payslip. Where in the provisions in here does it explain,74
NA,exactly what role these kids are going to play in these jobs? Are they going to be paid by the,74
NA,hour? Is that the plan for this loose $100 on top of their Newstart? Is the $100 if you show up,74
NA,or is it $100 if you work 15 hours? Does anyone want to quickly do the maths on how much,74
NA,an hour this worker is going to cost the company? It is not like we pay young people an,74
NA,extraordinary amount now.,74
NA,"There are real risks in this. As someone who spent her life working with young people, I",74
NA,know what those risks are. As someone who spent her life with young people who went and,74
NA,"got that part-time job after school, we applaud them and we love it. At 14 and nine months in",74
NA,"Victoria, off they go out the door to get that part-time job. But when they are doing year 12",74
NA,"and they turn 18, halfway through the year they come to see you, heartbroken because they",74
NA,are no longer in that part-time job. They are too old and they cost too much on an 18-year-,74
NA,"old's salary, so they have been replaced by a year 9 student. This will be open to absolute",74
NA,"exploitation and abuse, and this government should be ashamed to put it forward as a serious",74
NA,idea.,74
NA,This government wants to address youth unemployment. If they actually want to do,74
NA,"something serious for the 260,000 young people in this country that are currently looking for",74
NA,work then perhaps they need to address the way we build infrastructure. Perhaps we could,74
NA,take the advice of the economists around the country and get started on some of those things.,74
NA,"I note, too, today that we are talking about a situation where the ABCC bill, which is being",74
NA,"put to the Senate, actively discourages large companies from putting on apprentices. So, we",74
NA,NA,74
NA,will discourage apprenticeships and we will introduce internships-vaguely wrapped,75
NA,internships-in this path-to-nowhere program. Let's look at the notion of internships in this,75
NA,"country. We have people doing internships and, as I said, the general view of those",75
NA,internships is that they are part of some kind of university qualification as a workplace,75
NA,"placement and, in that sense, they are not necessarily a bad thing. But this legislation is a case",75
NA,of extrapolating from what the community perceives to be a good thing: you are going to a,75
NA,university that is going to give you not just an academic training but also the practical work,75
NA,component that is going to help you become more career ready. Note: we are talking about,75
NA,internships in this country that are generally about building a career; it is an entry level into a,75
NA,"career. However, we have now got this down to youth unemployment-youths of 17 to 24",75
NA,years of age. I do not think they are going to build a career from working for 12 weeks for,75
NA,"what is ostensibly $100 a week, on top of the government's Newstart allowance. So it is a",75
NA,subsidy for business. It is not about youth unemployment and it is not about preparing kids for,75
NA,work.,75
NA,"While I am here, I cannot ignore this notion-and I hear it in this place all the time-of",75
NA,how young people need to be in a program to develop soft work skills. What on earth are soft,75
NA,work skills? Tying your tie? Getting out of bed on time? As someone who has raised three,75
NA,"sons, I have watched them all go out to work at very early hours of the morning at young",75
NA,"ages. Every young person has to go through that process. We do not spit them out of school,",75
NA,"put them in a truck, take them to a job site and say, 'They're ready.' Part of that development is",75
NA,about the relationship between the employer and the young person. When young people go,75
NA,through those first months of getting up and getting ready for work they sometimes stumble.,75
NA,It takes them a little while sometimes to figure out that they actually need to go to bed before,75
NA,10 pm if they have to be up at 5.30 am. You cannot teach that as part of a program on soft,75
NA,skills. Our employers are not screaming out for young people to have soft skills. Our,75
NA,employers are asking for students who have the skills to work in a collaborative team. They,75
NA,are asking for literacy and numeracy. Most employers know that the soft skills of being polite,75
NA,to people and saying good morning when you get to work will have been learnt at home and,75
NA,that most of those things are about work culture. Work will teach them. They will develop,75
NA,those skills when they are at work.,75
NA,So we have this notion that we are going to subsidise companies to teach soft skills in an,75
NA,"internship that is about entry level work for young people. Let's face it, if this legislation",75
NA,comes into being then this internship is going to be about supermarkets. This is going to be,75
NA,about fast food outlets. This is going to be about 7-Eleven not having to break the law,75
NA,"anymore, because it will be legal for them to do what they have already been doing. In fact,",75
NA,"they will be further subsidised to do exactly what they have been doing, and they will be able",75
NA,to do it without having breached a visa regulation in the process because they will be doing it,75
NA,"to young Australian people. This is a road to nowhere. It is a path to nowhere. In fact, it is",75
NA,nowhere for a young person. We know where this path will lead to in terms of work,75
NA,conditions and wages in this country. It will drive down wages. It will drive down conditions.,75
NA,They are my other questions: does this young person get a pay slip? Is this young person,75
NA,"going to be on work experience, or are they considered to be an employee? Are they going to",75
NA,be covered by WorkCover? Are they going to be covered by the Fair Work Act? Will they,75
NA,have to provide their own equipment? Will they be expected to show up with hard shoes on,75
NA,on the first day of job? Will they have to pay for their uniform?,75
NA,NA,75
NA,This legislation is an absolute thought-bubble from this government. They have not given,76
NA,"any consideration to how they might tackle youth unemployment, except to find a way to",76
NA,drive down young people's wages and to drive down work conditions in this country. My last,76
NA,big question is: does the bill specify when these hours of work will occur? Will they be from,76
NA,8 pm until three in the morning for a job of picking up glasses at a nightclub? Is that the job,76
NA,"young people are going to be doing for their Newstart allowance, plus $100? Are there going",76
NA,to be limits on how far from home they can be asked to travel before they are cut off,76
NA,"Newstart, because they did not attend the nonworkplace for the noninternship to get their",76
NA,nontraining?,76
NA,This government should come into this place and treat it with some respect. They should,76
NA,approach the creation of legislation that is supposedly about getting young people into work,76
NA,seriously. If they cannot approach it seriously then they should sit down and watch some,76
NA,"American films, because I am sure that if they had seen The Pursuit of Happyness this bill",76
NA,"would never have come into this chamber. Will Smith did a terrific job in that film, showing",76
NA,us all what Americanisation looks like. If we want to have internships in this country then can,76
NA,we have it so that there is a clear advantage for young people to be engaged in them and it not,76
NA,be an opportunity for potential exploitation?,76
NA,I am going to finish with a quote from Clara Ivy Baird-a good friend of mine. She has,76
NA,worked in this building and now works for Interns Australia. She says:,76
NA,"There are countless interns who have gained real life benefits from their internships. Unfortunately,",76
NA,"however, the opposite is also true: desperate to pick up work, too many young Australians are being",76
NA,"lured in by an 'internship', and then used to pick up dry cleaning, make coffee and fill out data entry,",76
NA,often without being paid at all.,76
NA,That is the real experience of a young person who is dealing with other young people. The,76
NA,people she is mostly talking about have a university degree. They are not 17-year-olds straight,76
NA,"out of school, ripe for exploitation by this government and its cronies.",76
NA,NA,76
NA,"Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. Can I say",76
NA,"up-front, I commend the member for Lalor on her contribution. She is always worth listening",76
NA,"to, and she certainly seemed to cover the perils of this legislation very well.",76
NA,"In another life, before I was in parliament, I had a couple of jobs that were less well",76
NA,remunerated than being a politician. I started off my time at high school spending every,76
NA,"summer cotton chipping in the cotton fields around St George and then spent time, when I",76
NA,"was at teachers college, working in an abattoir and at Hungry Jack's before moving into better",76
NA,"paid jobs. I do say, Member for Lalor, that elements of my time as an articled clerk were not",76
NA,"unlike what you described, except they did pay me as an articled clerk. I think 'paid slavery'",76
NA,would be the official description.,76
NA,"In 2016, we have heard an awful lot about jobs-all that talk of jobs and growth. I think I",76
NA,will need to get a therapist at some stage to get 'jobs and growth' out of my head. The,76
NA,"coalition was all about the jobs and growth that they would be creating. But, sadly, the",76
NA,Turnbull government has failed at the very task that they set themselves-to create jobs and,76
NA,"to create growth. They set the standard, and they failed. They have not met their own",76
NA,"fundamental KPI which was-as written on the side of buses, basically-that they would",76
NA,deliver jobs and deliver growth.,76
NA,NA,76
NA,"Employment conditions have deteriorated so much that they are now, arguably, worse than",77
NA,"at any time since the peak of the global financial crisis. I remind you of that, Deputy Speaker",77
NA,"Broadbent, because the global financial crisis was the worst set of economic conditions since",77
NA,the Depression. But that is what we are looking at now. The problem is not just the,77
NA,unemployed; there is actually a huge problem in Australia of underemployment. The figure,77
NA,for underemployment for the August quarter was 8.7 per cent. Youth unemployment is at 12.8,77
NA,"per cent. There are more than 270,000 unemployed youth between 15 and 24 years of age. A",77
NA,recent report from Anglicare stated that there is only one job advertised for every six low-,77
NA,"skilled jobseekers in Australia. The report said that in May this year alone nearly 140,000",77
NA,"people competed for roughly 22,000 entry-level jobs advertised across Australia.",77
NA,"This is a huge problem, and one that will not be solved by the government's PaTH program",77
NA,"that is before the chamber. This bill is designed to support the government's prepare, trial, hire",77
NA,program-or PaTH. It provides that payments made to interns under the PaTH program will,77
NA,"be excluded from the income test for social security payments, and thus not affect recipients'",77
NA,payments and entitlements. It allows for the suspension for up to 26 weeks of a person's social,77
NA,"security payment, where they are employed by a business that is eligible to receive a youth",77
NA,bonus wage subsidy in relation to them under the PaTH program.,77
NA,The problem lies not so much with the provisions in this bill as with the PaTH program,77
NA,"itself, as detailed by the member for Lalor. The PaTH program is, appropriately, set to",77
NA,"commence on 1 April 2017-because, surely, this is an April Fools Day joke on the young",77
NA,people of Australia. The program claims to provide job seekers aged 17 to 24 with work,77
NA,"experience to maximise their prospects of subsequently gaining employment. These are,",77
NA,"perhaps, noble intentions. But, although the objectives of the program might have some merit,",77
NA,there are huge problems with the architecture of the scheme. Australia's young unemployed,77
NA,"are a very vulnerable group open to exploitation, and good government's job is to ensure that",77
NA,they are not being unfairly treated.,77
NA,"Existing programs, such as the Work for the Dole scheme, do have problems, and you",77
NA,"could argue that they are failing. On the government's own figures, nearly 90 per cent of",77
NA,participants in the Work for the Dole scheme are not in full-time work three months after,77
NA,completing the program. We do not want to see our young unemployed given false hope and,77
NA,working for under award wages in a scheme that is destined to fail them.,77
NA,"This scheme, unlike the Work for the Dole scheme, will place young unemployed people in",77
NA,"the private sector. Private sector employers will be paid $1,000 as an up-front payment for",77
NA,each jobseeker that they take on through the PaTH scheme. There are concerns that employers,77
NA,could take on large numbers of PaTH participants at any one time. Employers could churn,77
NA,"through the participants without ever offering a job to any of them-repeatedly saying, 'This",77
NA,person was unsuitable.' This could result in employers not having to employ workers in,77
NA,"particular areas at certain times. For example, an employer in the hospitality industry could",77
NA,use PaTH participants at a time when they would otherwise have to pay their staff penalty,77
NA,rates.,77
NA,There is a real concern that the PaTH program will result in jobs being replaced with,77
NA,cheaper labour because of this program. Participants will be 'working' for below minimum,77
NA,award wages. A PaTH participant will receive their Newstart payment plus the $200 incentive,77
NA,payment while they are working for an employer in the program. If the participant is working,77
NA,NA,77
NA,"for 25 hours a week, their hourly rate will be only $14.50. To put that in context, the national",78
NA,minimum wage is $17.70 an hour.,78
NA,The 7-Eleven wage scandal is fresh in our minds-we saw that footage. Here in Australia,78
NA,"in 2016 people are, effectively, paying their employer for the job that they have. I have not",78
NA,seen a lot of condemnation about that come from those opposite. In light of the 7-Eleven,78
NA,"scandal and some of the concerns in the fruit picking area, why should we consider",78
NA,sanctioning the underpayment of our unemployed youth? That problem with the scheme,78
NA,would be very easy to fix. The government would just need to set the bonus payment and the,78
NA,hours to be worked at a rate that equates with the national minimum wage. The fact that the,78
NA,government has not fixed this just shows where their priorities lie-despite their protestations,78
NA,"about unions, their priority is never to uphold workers' rights. Wages growth, sadly, is at its",78
NA,lowest on record. The PaTH program could further undermine wages across a variety of,78
NA,industries.,78
NA,"A further, very basic, problem with the scheme lies in the government's failure to actually",78
NA,define what they consider an 'intern' will be under the scheme. It is six months since the,78
NA,"scheme was announced, and we still have no definition. Can an intern be a waiter, for",78
NA,instance? Can an intern be a shop assistant or a retail assistant? Is there any threshold,78
NA,necessary for the intern to learn new skills? We just do not know. Most people consider,78
NA,interns to be learning something additional to that which they learn in educational institutions.,78
NA,"Traditional roles as interns have been found in publishing houses, law firms and other",78
NA,"professional services, where you will enhance what is delivered by academics. But it does not",78
NA,seem that the government's definition of an intern will marry with my traditional view of an,78
NA,intern that we are perhaps more familiar with. I should say up-front that I do not have a,78
NA,problem with industries having interns-it is this program that I have significant concerns,78
NA,about.,78
NA,There is another question that the government has not addressed yet-whether the,78
NA,participants in this scheme will be covered by appropriate workers compensation schemes in,78
NA,the event of an accident while they are 'working'. The participants will actually be considered,78
NA,volunteers in the workplace and not employees. This can affect how they will be treated by,78
NA,workers compensation schemes in the event of an accident. So there are many problems that,78
NA,"have not been addressed in this scheme, which was way too hurriedly announced by a",78
NA,desperate coalition in their May budget.,78
NA,The Prime Minister promised us the end of three-word slogans-but what did we see,78
NA,throughout the election campaign? Jobs and growth. I think I have even heard it this week.,78
NA,"Sadly, the Prime Minister has not delivered-on his watch youth unemployment has climbed",78
NA,"to nearly 13 per cent, double the national average. The Turnbull government talks the talk but",78
NA,"does not walk the walk when it comes to job creation. Representing a marginal seat, I should",78
NA,"point out that the Prime Minister decided to start his election campaign in my electorate, in",78
NA,"Moreton. It is a marginal seat, so I can understand that. He kicked that off at the Brisbane",78
NA,"markets, probably knowing that employment is always an important issue in the electorate of",78
NA,"Moreton. In the lead-up to the 2013 election the Liberal-National Party candidate, Malcolm",78
NA,Cole-a good bloke-made a commitment that the coalition would stage a Moreton jobs,78
NA,"summit within 100 days of the election. The Abbott government was elected, so the deadline",78
NA,"for the coalition government to hold this employment summit, important for Moreton, was",78
NA,NA,78
NA,Monday 16 December 2013. But nothing occurred-not a thing. On 27 September 2013 I,79
NA,"wrote to the relevant minister, Senator the Hon. Eric Abetz, a Tasmanian representative,",79
NA,regarding the implementation of the promised summit but to date this coalition 2013 election,79
NA,commitment has not been honoured.,79
NA,"This year we had a new election and a new parliament, the Prime Minister was elected by",79
NA,the people of Australia-with a majority of one-so I wrote to Prime Minister Turnbull after,79
NA,the election asking for the commitments made by the LNP during the 2016 election campaign,79
NA,to be honoured and I again asked that the commitment made during the 2013 campaign to,79
NA,"hold a Moreton jobs summit also be honoured. You would think, with all the rhetoric coming",79
NA,"from this government on jobs and growth, that the Prime Minister would be a man of his",79
NA,"word, that he would honour their commitment. Sadly, to this day there is still no jobs summit",79
NA,"on the horizon for Moreton- in fact, I have not even had a response from the Prime Minister",79
NA,to my letter to him. I call out the coalition government and ask that they honour their,79
NA,commitment-it is so important for the unemployed people in Moreton.,79
NA,"In contrast, the Labor Party has always had as its first priority the creation of jobs, and",79
NA,especially preparing youth for jobs. The member for Lalor and I in our previous lives were,79
NA,educators. We know how the important role education plays in giving people opportunities. In,79
NA,"fact, Labor announced as a 2007 election commitment the Trade Training Centres in Schools",79
NA,Program. The Labor government's 2008-09 budget subsequently provided $2.5 billion over 10,79
NA,years to implement that program. Four rounds of phase 1 of the program were completed,79
NA,"under the Labor government. Sadly, the coalition government announced in 2013 that the",79
NA,"funding for the trade training centres would cease following round five of phase 1, and the",79
NA,projects would thereafter be known as trade skills centres. The objectives of the Labor,79
NA,program included addressing skills shortages in traditional trades and other eligible,79
NA,occupations by improving student access to trade training facilities that meet industry,79
NA,standards and improving the quality of schooling offered to secondary students undertaking,79
NA,"trade related pathways. As this is the graduation season, we know how many students end up",79
NA,working through a variety of courses. People end up at university through a variety of,79
NA,"courses, including those trade training courses. The program was also assisting young people",79
NA,to make a successful transition from school to work or further education or training.,79
NA,This program is reaping benefits for the youth in my electorate of Moreton. I recently,79
NA,attended the opening of the trade skills centre at the Runcorn State High School with the,79
NA,member for MCPherson in her ministerial portfolio. Runcorn State High will now be offering,79
NA,their students the incredible benefits of having trade training facilities on site at their school.,79
NA,This facility will make an enormous difference to the future of these students. There will be,79
NA,two more trade skills centres opening in the future at nearby schools. The principals of those,79
NA,"schools, Terry Heath from Yeronga State High, also in my electorate, and Linda Galloway of",79
NA,"the Balmoral State High, in Griffith, were there to witness the opening of the Runcorn centre.",79
NA,"At the opening, I met Michael, who is a grade 10 student at Runcorn State High. He was",79
NA,proud to show me around the facilities. He said he was looking forward to the workshops,79
NA,starting so that he could build a Formula One car-one of the things they do. The Formula,79
NA,High School Program is one of the programs to be offered at the Runcorn State High School.,79
NA,It will teach students engineering skills and practices while building a race car-not quite the,79
NA,same as making a tea cosy for my mum when I was in shop. But this is not just fun; it,79
NA,NA,79
NA,obviously prepares them for work. Students who undertake the Formula High School Program,80
NA,"will be completing a certificate II in Engineering Pathways, an engineering qualification that",80
NA,"will equip them to enter a range of occupations. The student participants will learn practical,",80
NA,"general, work-ready knowledge and teambuilding skills-real preparation for jobs where",80
NA,"students learn a skill that is useful for employers, who will then give them a real job.",80
NA,I fear that this PaTH scheme is not going to result in any more young people obtaining full-,80
NA,"time work, but it may put the young unemployed, who are already vulnerable, in situations",80
NA,where they will be exploited. Young people deserve better than to be used and abused by an,80
NA,unscrupulous employer wanting cheap labour. That is my fear. Labor is calling for this,80
NA,legislation and the PaTH program itself to be considered by a Senate inquiry to ensure that,80
NA,these concerns are addressed. (Time expired),80
NA,"Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:29): I was not actually going to speak on this bill, but",80
NA,"I heard the member for Lalor talking about the movie The Pursuit of Happyness, saying how",80
NA,this is an example of why intern programs are not very good. The member for Lalor may not,80
NA,"be aware, but the movie The Pursuit of Happyness was based on a true story of an American",80
NA,"gentleman called Chris Gardner. He left jail with no experience, no college education, no",80

NA,Indi Electorate: Jobs and Investment Fund,80
Ms MCGOWAN ,Indi) (13:30): I call on the coalition to walk the talk of listening to,80
NA,"communities, avoiding duplication and respecting the local knowledge and experience of the",80
NA,leaders in rural and regional Australia.,80
NA,"The case in point: on Monday, in the Federation Chamber, the member for Murray referred",80
NA,to the $20 million promised during the election campaign to the Hume region under the jobs,80
NA,"and investment fund. He told us how he called a special meeting of 13 LGAs, who all came",80
NA,together to add their advice to the $20 million jobs and investment fund that has been put,80
NA,"forward by the minister, Senator Fiona Nash.",80
NA,What I want to say to the coalition is that the member for Murray did not say that there is,80
NA,already a Commonwealth government advisory body that is commissioned to provide advice,80
NA,"on jobs and investment. This is the Hume RDA, which has representatives from LGAs,",80
NA,"government, business, industry and community. The chair of the Hume RDA has specifically",80
NA,"communicated with the government, and me, to say that the RDA is the ideal body, already",80
NA,"set up and already operating, to provide advice on this program. But, sadly, it has been",80
NA,ignored. Another meeting was held and more community people's time was wasted.,80
NA,"Recently, in a speech to the Press Club, the Minister for Regional Development lauded our",80
NA,rural leaders and said how pragmatic they are. My message to the coalition is this: do not,80
NA,"ignore local advice and experience. Listen to these very pragmatic rural communities,",80

NA,like to congratulate our local police forces serving under the command of local area,81
NA,commander Superintendent Julian Griffiths at Sutherland and Superintendent Peter Gillam at,81
NA,"Liverpool. You can look at the fine job that they are doing in my local area, and in New South",81
NA,"Wales, by comparing some of the crime statistics in New South Wales with those of Victoria.",81
NA,"For motor vehicle theft in New South Wales over the last 12 months, we have seen a 12.6 per",81
NA,"cent decrease. In Victoria over the same period of time, we have seen a 33 per cent increase in",81
NA,"motor vehicle theft. In fact, today, if someone in New South Wales drove across the border",81
NA,"into Victoria, they would be 66 per cent more likely to have their car stolen.",81
NA,"Also, in robbery, we see that offences in New South Wales are down between 22 and 42",81
NA,"per cent. In comparison, we see that offences in Victoria are up 14 per cent. The same goes",81
NA,"for break and enter of a dwelling. In New South Wales, the numbers, thankfully, are down 7.2",81
NA,"per cent, but in Victoria, they are up 12.6 per cent. For stealing, we are seeing that New South",81

NA,Migration,81
Mr KHALIL ,Wills) (13:33): The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection,81
NA,confirmed yesterday that he believed that tens of thousands of Lebanese who migrated to,81
NA,"Australia were a mistake, because 22 of their grandchildren had been charged with terrorist",81
NA,"offences. By this twisted logic, all migration from the UK would be a mistake, because David",81
NA,Hicks was charged with terror offences.,81
NA,The Minister has displayed a breathtaking ignorance of the success of generations of,81
NA,"Lebanese Australians, the success of people like former Victorian Premier Steve Bracks,",81
NA,Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour Richmond footballer Bachar Houliorr and my mate David,81
NA,Basheer at SBS.,81
NA,It was during the early 1970s that my parents also were able to escape a war-torn Middle,81
NA,"East for a life of peace and security in Australia. Like millions of migrants, including the",81
NA,"Lebanese, they worked hard and made a contribution to their adopted country, instilling in us,",81
NA,"the next generation of Australians, the importance of giving something back to the country",81
NA,that gave us such an opportunity.,81
NA,The minister refused to apologise for his offensive comments; he doubled down. It was a,81
NA,"pathetic, sad attempt at divisive politics. He may seek to distract from the myriad failings",81
NA,"occurring under this government, but, in doing so, he causes enormous damage to our social",81
NA,"cohesion. Worse, he has abrogated his responsibility as Minister for Immigration to bring",81
NA,"Australians together. Rather, he has chosen to divide us through fearmongering.",81
NA,"And I ask the Minister for Immigration: does he believe, as he does for the hundreds of",81
NA,"thousands of Lebanese Australians, that letting my family migrate from Egypt to this country",81
NA,was a mistake?,81

Mr LAMING ,"Bowman) (13:34): On that same topic, the ministerial statement this",82
NA,"week-the truthful statement-that 22 of 33, or two-thirds of all terror-related offences, are",82
NA,"directly related to one ethno-religious group is just that-truth. We are in a nation that, no",82
NA,"matter uncomfortable, has to be able to express the truth. It is prima facie correct, and we, as a",82
NA,"nation, need the public interest to decide how important that information is. The minister does",82
NA,not deserve to be criticised by those who do not agree with him.,82
NA,Ms Ryan interjecting-,82
Mr LAMING," I listened politely to you and I ask Labor to listen politely to me, instead of",82
NA,"shutting me down with a gobful. In this dialectic, our failure to engage this reality makes our",82
NA,nation weaker-,82
NA,Ms Ryan interjecting-,82
The DEPUTY SPEAKER, The member for Lalor.,82
Mr LAMING," Again, I ask Labor to listen as I did to them. If any religious and ethnic",82
NA,group that represents less than half a per cent of our population gets twice the number of carer,82
NA,"payments, three times the number of disability payments, twice the amount of Newstart",82
NA,"payments, are 94 per cent unemployed when they arrive and remain at 80 per cent two to nine",82
NA,"years later, we need to talk about that. It is a failure as much by our system as it is of that",82
NA,group. This is a major PR disaster for this ethnic group. We need to work towards giving their,82
NA,"children the education they need, the youth the training they need and the young adults the",82

NA,Dobell Electorate: Veterans,82
Ms MCBRIDE ,Dobell) (13:36): The Toukley RSL Sub-Branch will hold a dedication,82
NA,service for their restored cenotaph memorial this Friday. The original cenotaph was erected in,82
NA,"1971 and marks the final resting place of 397 deceased sub-branch members, whose ashes are",82
NA,"interred in the cenotaph memorial gardens. With the passing of time, the condition of the",82
NA,"names on the plaques has, sadly, deteriorated. The sub-branch members got to work and",82
NA,"significantly upgraded the memorial. The plaques have been restored and, once again, names",82
NA,"can be read and remembered. The concrete plinths are now beautiful granite borders, and a",82
NA,"new rosemary garden creates a fitting place for members, families and the community to",82
NA,remember our departed veterans.,82
NA,"The service this week will be marked by the planting of a lone pine, struck from a seed that",82
NA,"originated in Gallipoli. This memorial, which pays tribute to those who made the ultimate",82
NA,"sacrifice in the First World War, is part of the sub-branch's broader Centenary of Anzac",82
NA,commemorations. A plaque remembering those who participated in the Vietnam conflict will,82
NA,also be unveiled. I congratulate Toukley RSL Sub-branch President Bob Wilson; his vice-,82
NA,"presidents, Tom Hobbs and Keith Bailey; and sub-branch secretary, Graham Tredinnick, on",82
NA,their work in returning dignity to the memorial. Thank you to all members of the Toukley,82

NA,Capricornia Electorate: Adani Solar Farm,83
Ms LANDRY ,Capricornia-Deputy Nationals Whip) (13:38): With many job losses in,83
NA,"the Queensland coal sector in the past few years, I rise today to inform the House of some",83
NA,good news. Indian based energy company Adani will construct a $200 million solar farm near,83
NA,"Moranbah, in the inland coalfields of my electorate of Capricornia. The project is touted to",83
NA,create hundreds of new jobs over various stages of the work. This will provide a welcome,83
NA,"shot in the arm for the mining town, normally reliant on coal. The Adani energy company will",83
NA,build the solar plant on 600 hectares of land on a local cattle property about 20 kilometres,83
NA,"from Moranbah. The 100 megawatts of power to be generated will be significant, and this",83
NA,"project, along with the Adani Carmichael coal project, demonstrates the company is",83
NA,committed to Queensland and job creation. The company expects construction to begin on the,83
NA,solar farm in mid-2017. The federal government has a policy of transitioning the economy,83
NA,"from being resources-heavy to a future of innovation and technology, and this is one type of",83
NA,"project that meets this goal. It also adds to our bipartisan, fully legislated renewable energy",83
NA,"target of 23.5 per cent by 2020. For the record, Adani coal will not be used in Australia but",83
NA,will be exported to India.,83
NA,Werriwa Electorate: Amity College,83
Ms STANLEY ,"Werriwa) (13:39): This year, Amity College in Prestons celebrates its",83
NA,20th anniversary. I was very privileged to be present for the celebration of this milestone in,83
NA,September and again at the college last weekend for the year 12 graduation. The school was,83
NA,"originally established by volunteers, with 33 students. It now has enrolments exceeding 1,800,",83
NA,"with other campuses at Auburn and Shellharbour. As a local, I have been able to watch the",83
NA,school grow to the excellent teaching facility that it is today. I am always inspired by the,83
NA,"achievements of its students, not only academically but also in the extra activities and",83
NA,volunteer pursuits that the students are encouraged to pursue.,83
NA,South-west Sydney has a highly diverse population. Many people move to my area looking,83
NA,to raise their children. Our schools serve as community focal points and are a key part in,83
NA,helping shape these communities. Amity lives up to its name. It is a proud embodiment of the,83
NA,multicultural tradition of Western Sydney and of Werriwa and is an asset to my community.,83
NA,"Twenty years is a long time, and the college is now beginning to span generations. Students",83
NA,"who attended here in the 1990s are now sending their own children to the school, and former",83
NA,"students are teachers. I congratulate the executive principal, Denis Erdogan; girls principal,",83

Mr LITTLEPROUD ,Maranoa) (13:41): Today I would like to acknowledge the,83
NA,"crucially important contribution of South Burnett CTC, who work with those with disabilities",83
NA,in the South Burnett region. The humble beginnings of South Burnett CTC were as a,83
NA,"grassroots community response to youth unemployment back in 1983. The dedicated,",83
NA,compassionate and community-minded people at South Burnett CTC have ensured that this,83
NA,not-for-profit organisation has grown into a multifaceted community-owned service for,83
NA,"people across South Burnett, including Gumnut, which provides supported employment",83
NA,opportunities for up to 20 people with disabilities.,83
NA,NA,83
NA,"Last week I was fortunate enough to attend the opening of Heritage Lodge in Nanango, an",84
NA,"accommodation precinct of duplexes designed and managed by South Burnett CTC, to allow",84
NA,"people with disabilities to live independently. As I sat there at the opening ceremony,",84
NA,"listening to Nina Temperton, the CEO of South Burnett CTC, I was reminded of the value of",84
NA,"the sheer dedication and commitment of passionate and community-minded people like Nina,",84
NA,people on the ground who see a need and pursue the solution relentlessly. I would also like to,84
NA,"note Heritage Nanango Community Funding Ltd, South Burnett Regional Council and the",84
NA,Queensland state government for their contributions to this project.,84
NA,It is the community spirit I have been witnessing all over my electorate that I will be,84
NA,"highlighting this Christmas. These amazing people, whether they are paid or whether they are",84
NA,"volunteers, contribute so much to our social fabric and serve as a timely reminder of the",84
NA,importance of our roles in being advocates for our respective communities.,84
NA,Burt Electorate: Mosque Attacks,84
Mr KEOGH ,Burt) (13:42): There are some experiences during campaigns that shake and,84
NA,disturb you to the core. I am referring to the disgusting and cowardly attacks on two mosques,84
NA,in the electorate of Burt during the recent election campaign: the leaving of insulting and,84
NA,"disgusting objects at the Southern River mosque, and the fire-bombing of a car and graffiti at",84
NA,the Australian Islamic College and mosque in Thornlie. The new electorate of Burt is one of,84
NA,the most multicultural in Western Australia-a diversity that should be celebrated. We have,84
NA,moved on from the Christian sectarianism so commonplace in Australia until merely a,84
NA,"generation ago, so must we as a nation move on from religious vilification and attacks of all",84
NA,forms.,84
NA,Yet some members of different religious traditions face religious persecution every day in,84
NA,Australia. As retired Chief of Army Lieutenant General David Morrison AO so elegantly,84
NA,"expressed it, the standard you walk past is the standard you accept. As a multicultural society,",84
NA,we must accept and protect each and every person's right to practise their faith freely and,84
NA,"without any form of intimidation or violence, just as we ask them to do the same and as we all",84
NA,stand for the Australian fair go.,84
NA,I would like to acknowledge the good work of the WA Police in their investigations and,84
NA,"support of the local community; the state member for Gosnells and Thornlie, Chris Tallentire;",84
NA,"and City of Gosnells councillor Terry Healy, for responding so quickly to help the local",84
NA,"community clean up before the children arrived for school the next morning, as well as Salim",84
NA,"and Raif Youssef, the current and former presidents of the Australian Arab Association and",84
NA,"proud Lebanese Australians in my electorate, who are in the gallery here today.",84
NA,"Maddinson, Mr Nic",84
NA,Mrs SUDMALIS (Gilmore) (13:44): As anyone will tell you-particularly my family-I,84
NA,"am usually not much of a cricket watcher. However, when parliament closes on Thursday, I",84
NA,"will be searching for the cricket highlights, because Nic Maddinson will make his debut for",84
NA,Australia in the third test against South Africa. Nic will play on the Adelaide Oval. While this,84
NA,"is one of cricket's greatest honours, more importantly Nic is a resident of the Shoalhaven area,",84
NA,"in my electorate of Gilmore. Alongside fellow Shoalhaven resident Ian Davis, Nic will be the",84
NA,Shoalhaven's second test cricketer.,84
NA,NA,84
NA,Nic has had close to 60 first-class games and has previously played for Australia in the,85
NA,"Twenty20 and an Australian A team. On the local scene, Nic has competed in the Bradman",85
NA,"Cup, Southern Zone and country teams. He began playing representative cricket for the",85
NA,"Shoalhaven in the under-12s, competed in state teams and national junior teams and was a",85
NA,member of the Australian under-19s who successfully competed in and won the World Cup in,85
NA,2010.,85
NA,"Locally, Nic has been awarded the Shoalhaven Sportstar of the Year award for three years",85
NA,and was also the recipient of the very famous Bernie Regan Memorial Sporting Trust Grant.,85
NA,"More than five years ago, at the age of 18 years, Nic made his Sheffield Shield debut in",85
NA,"Adelaide and posted 113, which broke a 70-year-old state record as the youngest century-",85
NA,maker on debut. Everyone in our region will be sending their best wishes to Nic in his first,85
NA,"test cricket match because he makes us all so proud. Go, Nic!",85
NA,Geelong: Digital Billboard,85
Mr MARLES ,"Corio) (13:45): Back in April, VCAT approved a giant digital billboard on",85
NA,the corner of Yarra and Malop Streets. It is twice the size of a similar digital billboard,85
NA,installed on the corner of Moorabool and Ryrie Streets. The City of Greater Geelong had,85
NA,"refused to grant a permit for the 'sky sign', citing that it did not suit the location, was",85
NA,oversized and shared no objective with the Central Geelong Urban Design Guidelines.,85
NA,The council was right. This sort of large electronic advertising sign in the heart of our CBD,85
NA,"distracts from the very things that Geelong should be emphasising: our history, our",85
NA,"architecture and our heritage. Geelong is one of the most historic towns in Australia, although",85
NA,"we do not often think of ourselves in this way. Indeed, the Geelong CBD has one of the best",85
NA,"collections of heritage buildings adjacent to water anywhere in the country. The woolsheds,",85
NA,"the factories, the shopfronts and the Customs House-these are what make Geelong special,",85
NA,"not electronic billboards, and we will never compete on the basis of neon signs with our large",85
NA,neighbour up the road.,85
NA,I firmly believe that the secret to reinvigorating our CBD does not lie in flashy lights. Just,85
NA,"like Ballarat and Bendigo, but potentially on a much bigger scale, it lies in developing our",85
NA,heritage. It is important we show off who we are as a city and do not allow our beautiful,85
NA,"architecture and streets to fall into the background. Let us show off the art gallery, the",85
NA,"telegraph station, the Gordon, the boardwalk and the old Geelong post office, because they",85
NA,tell our story; they tell Geelong's deeply historic story.,85
NA,Trade with Hong Kong,85
Dr MCVEIGH ,Groom) (13:47): The first consignment of international air freight from,85
NA,the nation's largest privately-owned airport touched down in Hong Kong this morning. This is,85
NA,a remarkable case of endeavour and initiative from the Darling Downs. Many said it was a,85
NA,pipe dream. But those naysayers have learnt that Toowoomba's Wagner family should never,85
NA,be underestimated. Due to their foresight and the commitment of local families and,85
NA,"businesses, the potential for our electorate of Groom is only limited by the constraints we",85
NA,place on ourselves.,85
NA,"Not so long ago, people would have thought that air-freighting fresh produce to Asian",85
NA,"markets from the Downs was a good idea but one fraught with challenges. Well, last night, a",85
NA,Cathay Pacific Airways 747 cargo flight did just that. It was loaded with chilled beef and,85

NA,"other produce to be taken to market. This regular service will see Australian clean, green and",86
NA,"safe produce from the Darling Downs flown directly into Asia-including, for example,",86
NA,premium beef loin cuts from Oakey Beef Exports destined for high-end restaurants in Hong,86
NA,Kong.,86
NA,Groom is truly a world-class example of industry leading business and job creation and,86
NA,"growth, and of all levels of government supporting and facilitating where appropriate. I am",86
NA,proud to say: that is exactly what the Turnbull government has been doing in securing,86
NA,"approvals for this airport, investing heavily in our roads, and getting on with the job of inland",86
NA,rail.,86
NA,"Smith, Mr Michael",86
Ms CHESTERS ,Bendigo) (13:48): Today I rise to welcome to the Speaker's gallery,86
NA,Michael Smith. Michael Smith has been on a journey. He has walked 600 kilometres from,86
NA,"Chewton in the Bendigo electorate in central Victoria to this place, to raise and highlight one",86
NA,of his great concerns. Michael has actually drafted a bill. He believes that it is this place and,86
NA,this parliament that should make the decision about whether this country enters into armed,86
NA,conflict and whether we deploy to war; he does not believe that it should be made by one,86
NA,"person. In a recent interview with the ABC, Michael said:",86
NA,I don't think these decisions should be with one person. I think that the more people that are involved,86
NA,"in the decision, the better decision we'll get.",86
NA,These are Michael's views.,86
NA,We should congratulate and acknowledge anybody with this passion and commitment. To,86
NA,walk 600 kays to come here to raise this issue is a fantastic effort. And I know that the people,86
NA,of Chewton-the people's republic of Chewton-are very proud of Michael's efforts.,86
NA,"What this does is to remind all of us that we have great responsibility in this place, and,",86
NA,"when one of our constituents makes this kind of effort, we should take time to discuss this in",86
NA,"our party room and in our caucuses to see what more we can do in this area. Congratulations,",86
NA,"Michael, on your efforts.",86
NA,Tangney Electorate: Willetton Bowling Club,86
Mr MORTON ,Tangney) (13:50): It was great news for the Willetton Bowling Club in,86
NA,Tangney when I was able to telephone Club President Max Strange to let him know that a,86
NA,"$250,000 grant from the federal government would be on its way to their club very soon. The",86
NA,"Minister for Regional Development, Fiona Nash, has approved a Community Development",86
NA,Grant for a new synthetic green at this club that delivers on our election commitment.,86
NA,"Willetton Bowling Club will also install new lighting to complete the project, with an",86
NA,"additional $20,000 from a Stronger Communities grant. Importantly, Willetton Bowling Club",86
NA,will contribute their own fundraising towards these projects.,86
NA,The new Ultra Dry Max Pro synthetic grass green is great news for pennants players. And,86
NA,the new lights will mean both social and competition bowlers can play later into the evening,86
NA,and on more days of the year. Wet weather will no longer stop the members and friends at,86
NA,Willetton Bowling Club from getting out on the green and enjoying a game. The fantastic,86
NA,club rooms built in recent years by the City of Canning and the new synthetic green and new,86
NA,lighting will make Willetton Bowling Club's facilities second to none.,86
NA,NA,86
NA,"I cannot wait to see the project completed before next winter, and I look forward to getting",87
NA,down to the club to catch up with members very soon.,87
NA,"Jagajaga Electorate: Pasinis, Mr Jim",87
Ms MACKLIN ,Jagajaga) (13:52): I am very pleased today to acknowledge the enormous,87
NA,contribution of Jim Pasinis as chief executive of Banyule Community Health. This month Jim,87
NA,"has stepped down from his role as chief executive officer, a position he has held for the last",87
NA,"26 years. Jim has led the extraordinary growth of Banyule Community Health, an incredible",87
NA,community health organisation that has been at the heart of West Heidelberg for more than 40,87
NA,years. It is one of the original Whitlam community health centres. It is a very lively,87
NA,"community centre, where everyone knows that they can get the health and social services that",87
NA,they need.,87
NA,"Under Jim's leadership, Banyule Community Health has been completely rebuilt into its",87
NA,fantastic modern home in Alamein Road. This simply would not have been possible without,87
NA,"Jim's commitment, dedication and hard work. In 2016, Jim was awarded Banyule Citizen of",87
NA,the Year in recognition of his commitment to social justice. West Heidelberg will miss him. I,87
NA,"will miss him. Yes, we will miss his quirky sense of humour but, above all, we will miss his",87
NA,"compassion, his commitment to social justice and his strong leadership. Thank you, Jim.",87
NA,Flynn Electorate: Drought,87
NA,Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (13:53): I wish to speak today about the most widespread drought,87
NA,in Queensland's history. Despite fantastic winter rains across most of Queensland and record,87
NA,"high prices for beef cattle, many producers are still doing it tough and know the drought is not",87
NA,over yet. Rainfall over the last two months is down by 80 per cent on average. More than 80,87
NA,"per cent of Queensland is still drought-declared, including almost the entire electorate of",87
NA,"Flynn. North Burnett, South Burnett, Banana Shire, the Gladstone region and the Bundaberg",87
NA,region are completely declared. Only the Rockhampton area and the northern reaches of the,87
NA,Central Highlands are no longer declared.,87
NA,"June and July, which are normally very dry months, provided welcome relief for many",87
NA,"landholders across the state, with record rainfall in these parts-but, unfortunately, it does not",87
NA,"rain money. While the dust was settled and grass grew, livestock prices remained incredibly",87
NA,"high, making restocking a high-risk venture, especially when there is no guarantee of much-",87
NA,"needed follow-up rain. As we wind up for the year, I hope that those in this place will spare a",87
NA,"thought and a prayer for our farmers, as they need the rain to provide you with Christmas",87
NA,dinner.,87
NA,Multiculturalism,87
Ms RYAN ,Lalor-Opposition Whip) (13:54): I stand here as a proud Australian. There,87
NA,are lots of things about Australia that I am proud of. One of the things I am proudest of is that,87
NA,a country that was built as a supposed prison built a great democracy and embedded the rule,87
NA,"of law in our great egalitarian society. I am incredibly proud to call myself an Australian, and",87
NA,I am incredibly proud of our multiculturalism. But I am saddened that this week a minister of,87
NA,the Crown has come into this place and sought to divide this country-sought to smear a,87
NA,whole community on the actions of so few.,87
NA,One of the things about the rule of law in this country that I am so proud of is that we hold,87
NA,individuals accountable for their actions. We do not hold the entire Catholic community,87
NA,NA,87
NA,responsible for the sexual assault against children that happened in our history. If that were,88
NA,"the case, all of us in this chamber would be ashamed. We do not smear a whole community on",88
NA,the back of the actions of a few. We have rule of law in this country. I am ashamed that a,88
NA,minister of the Crown would come into this place and try to divide and smear communities.,88
NA,But he has had practice. In the last week they have also been trying to smear every unionist in,88
NA,the country for the actions of a few.,88
NA,Sunshine Coast: Infrastructure,88
NA,Mr TED O'BRIEN (Fairfax) (13:55): I am delighted to say something positive on the,88
NA,"back of such negativity coming from the opposition. When it comes to strong representation,",88
NA,"the Sunshine Coast is back. Admittedly, we actually had a few tough years, because my",88
NA,"predecessor, the former member for Fairfax, was a serial absentee. I think he attended less",88
NA,"than eight per cent of divisions. But, boy, has the world changed now. It has changed because",88
NA,"we have a united force, with the member for Fisher, with the member for Wide Bay and with",88
NA,"me as the member for Fairfax, working exactly how the Turnbull government works:",88
NA,delivering as a united team.,88
NA,"Look at the big ticket items on the Sunshine Coast. Take the Bruce Highway, with over a",88
NA,billion dollars on local stretches of the Bruce Highway. Then there is the Sunshine Coast,88
NA,"Airport. Within four months alone, what have we seen? We have seen an environmental green",88
NA,"light-tick, done, delivered. We have also seen the designation of the airport as an",88
NA,"international airport-done, tick, delivered. As of last week, the Turnbull government",88
NA,"announced a $181 million concessional loan to that airport-done, tick, delivered. We will",88
NA,continue to work as a united team to deliver for the Sunshine Coast.,88
NA,Multiculturalism,88
Mr HAMMOND ,Perth) (13:57): I rise to speak on behalf of those very good people in,88
NA,"my electorate of Perth, who the Minister for Immigration and others on the government side",88
NA,might like to describe as 'the children of second and third generation immigrants'. Those,88
NA,electors who I am privileged to speak on behalf of are so much more than that and so much,88
NA,more than the unfair and untrue slur that the Minister for Immigration and those on that side,88
NA,"would like to paint them as. They are doctors, they are nurses, they are teachers, they are hard",88
NA,"workers and their mums and dads contribute to P&Cs. They are Australians, and they are the",88
NA,people who make this country what it is.,88
NA,"They do not deserve to be painted, as the members of the other side would like to have",88
NA,"them painted, as those who are responsible for the security of this country being at risk. They",88
NA,"are Australians. There is a culture on the other side where the member for Bowman, the",88
NA,Minister for Immigration and the Prime Minister hide behind a number of facts without,88
NA,displaying the truth. The truth is that these are not immigrants; these are Australians. The,88
NA,Prime Minister is held captive to his conservative right. This Prime Minister is now just,88
NA,somebody that we used to know.,88
NA,Wide Bay Electorate: Bruce Highway Upgrade,88
NA,Mr LLEW O'BRIEN (Wide Bay) (13:59): It was a pleasure to welcome the Minister for,88
NA,Infrastructure and Transport to Wide Bay last week to inspect progress on the Bruce,88
NA,"Highway, Cooroy to Curra, four-lane Section C project. Section C is a 10.5 kilometre stretch",88
NA,of highway from Traveston to Woondum and is scheduled to finish in mid-2018. The,88
NA,NA,88
NA,"construction phase is supporting around 600 jobs and, when completed, will boost the local",89
NA,"economy. At the 2013 election, the coalition government committed to $2 billion to upgrade",89
NA,the Bruce Highway through Wide Bay. The Cooroy to Curra four-lane upgrade will make that,89
NA,"section safer, faster and less congested, and it will improve flood immunity to prevent",89
NA,Gympie being cut off when the Mary River floods. It will also improve the capacity to move,89
NA,"freight more efficiently along the coast. This will support major industry in the region,",89
NA,"including the timber industry, manufacturing, dairying and local agriculture.",89
NA,The Cooroy to Curra section was rated as one of the most dangerous sections of highway.,89
NA,Between 2002 and 2014 more than 50 people lost their lives along this deadly stretch.,89
NA,"Regrettably, there are still too many lives being touched by the horror of serious accidents",89
NA,along this section yet to be upgraded. We need to continue to invest in the highway to make it,89
NA,"safer and complete the full Cooroy to Curra project, including the 26 kilometre section D",89
NA,project to bypass Gympie.,89
NA,Parliament House: Christmas Carols,89
NA,NA,89
NA,"Tonight in the Members Hall, the Canberra Choral Society will be singing Christmas carols",89
NA,"for the benefit of the members, staff and others who inhabit the building, including Laura",89
NA,"Tingle. I am sure we would much prefer to hear Laura Tingle singing than her husband, Alan",89
NA,"Ramsey, who probably does not have nearly as nice a voice!",89
The SPEAKER," In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements",89
NA,has concluded.,89
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,89
NA,Domestic and Family Violence,89
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (14:01): My question is to the,89
NA,Prime Minister. Congratulations on your words at White Ribbon this morning. All of us agree,89
NA,"that family violence is a national crisis. Rosie Batty, the Productivity Commission and the",89
NA,Victorian Royal Commission into Family Violence have all recommended that family,89
NA,violence survivors should not be cross-examined in court by their abusers. Will the Prime,89
NA,Minister join with Labor to amend the Family Law Act to ensure that vulnerable witnesses are,89
NA,protected during court proceedings?,89
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (14:01): I want to thank the Leader of the,89
NA,"Opposition for his question, and thank him, his colleagues and all members for their support",89
NA,for White Ribbon. Addressing domestic violence is a priority for all of us. We have to stop it.,89
NA,Violence against women and children is utterly unacceptable. The truth is that not all,89
NA,"disrespect of women ends up with violence against women, but that is where all violence",89
NA,"against women begins. We have to lead with legislation, investments and government actions.",89
NA,"But one of the most important things we have to do, as parents or grandparents, is say that it is",89
NA,our responsibility to make sure our sons and our grandsons grow up to respect the women in,89
NA,"their lives, beginning with their mothers and their sisters-those most close to them. That is",89
NA,"critically important. It is a point my wife, Lucy, has often made-it is a powerful one. That",89
NA,role of leadership is driving cultural change. The advertising campaign that I know all of us,89
NA,"have admired, Stop it at the Start, that Senator Cash oversaw, has been particularly effective.",89
NA,NA,89
NA,Let me address the issue of cross examination. We all understand that the cross-,90
NA,examination of a victim by the alleged perpetrator is a very traumatic experience. We are,90
NA,"working very closely with the stakeholders in this area, in particular the judges and",90
NA,"magistrates of the family courts, to progress measures to support vulnerable witnesses. We are",90
NA,establishing integrated duty lawyer and domestic violence support services in the family law,90
NA,"courts to improve the support available to victims, and that includes assisting them to draft",90
NA,notices of risk and access alternative ways to give evidence. We have also commissioned a,90
NA,bench book which provides guidance for all judicial officers dealing with domestic and family,90
NA,"violence, including guidelines for courtroom management to minimise secondary abuse",90
NA,through court processes of those that have experienced family violence. Judges and judicial,90
NA,"officers always have a discretion, of course, in this area, and we are encouraging them to use",90
NA,this very actively to ensure that these distressing circumstances do not occur.,90
NA,I noted what the honourable member opposite proposed this morning and the funding that,90
NA,"he recommended, which, at first examination, would not appear to us to be adequate for the",90
NA,task that he has proposed. But I can assure honourable members opposite we are very well,90
NA,"aware of the trauma that victims suffer if they are cross-examined by a perpetrator, and we",90
NA,have put in place the measures to ensure that that does not occur where it would create that,90
NA,type of trauma.,90
NA,Turnbull Government,90
Mr HOWARTH ,Petrie) (14:05): My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime,90
NA,Minister please update the House on the government's record of delivering on its election,90
NA,"commitments, including tackling union corruption and ensuring that employer organisations",90
NA,are more accountable to their members as well?,90
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,90
The SPEAKER, Members on both sides: the Prime Minister has the call.,90
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (14:05): I thank the honourable member,90
NA,for his question. The government is getting on with the job. We are delivering for the,90
NA,Australian people. We are providing the strong and stable economic leadership Australia,90
NA,needs in this time of great change and even greater opportunity. To secure our future,90
NA,"prosperity, to ensure that our children and grandchildren can enjoy the same and better",90
NA,standards of living than that which we enjoy we must live within our means and we must,90
NA,"continue to pursue sound economic reforms, and that is exactly what we are doing.",90
NA,"Just this morning, the parliament passed our superannuation reforms, ensuring that the",90
NA,superannuation system is fair and sustainable for all Australians. We are making the 45th,90
NA,Parliament work-an obligation that falls to all of us-delivering important economic,90
NA,"reforms, including around $20 billion in gross budget repair; tax cuts to stop half a million",90
NA,middle-income Australians from entering the second-highest tax bracket; building on our big,90
NA,"export trade deals by enhancing our free trade and strategic agreement with Singapore; and,",90
NA,"for the first time, the parliament has passed the Fair Work (Registered Organisations)",90
NA,Amendment Bill 2014. The 44th Parliament rejected the bill three times; now it has been,90
NA,passed.,90
NA,This will ensure that union officials are as accountable to their members as company,90
NA,directors are to their shareholders. We are cracking down on the dishonesty and the,90
NA,NA,90
NA,"malfeasance, the misuse and the abuse that has become all too common with union bosses.",91
NA,We are standing up for the workers. We are standing up for the members of trade unions.,91
NA,They are entitled to see that their money is well spent. They are entitled to know how it is,91
NA,spent. They are entitled to know where there are conflicts of interest. They are entitled to,91
NA,know whether their hard-earned union dues are being frittered away by union officials on,91
NA,personal extravagances.,91
NA,"You would think that the Leader of the Opposition, a former union boss himself and a",91
NA,"former senior union leader, would support this. After all, given the scandals that we saw with",91
NA,Craig Thompson and others-so many of them have been exposed in the Heydon royal,91
NA,"commission that there have been two arrests just over the last few days-and the $870,000",91
NA,"misappropriated from the National Union of Workers, who are some of the lowest-paid",91
NA,"workers in Australia, you would think that the Labor Party, composed as it is of so many",91
NA,"former union officials, would say, 'Here is a chance to clean up the act. Here is a chance to",91
NA,make unions more attractive than they are today and make people more confident about,91
NA,joining them.' Labor did not do that. Labor backed the bosses. We backed the members.,91
NA,Budget,91
Mr BOWEN ,MCMahon) (14:08): My question is to the Treasurer. Ratings agency,91
NA,Standard & Poor's has today warned that Australia's AAA credit rating will be at risk unless,91
NA,"the Treasurer stands by his commitment to a surplus in 2021, a commitment which is in the",91
NA,Treasurer's own budget papers that bear his name. With his chaotic management of the,91
NA,"budget, does the Treasurer take any responsibility for placing Australia's AAA rating at risk?",91
Mr MORRISON ,Cook-Treasurer) (14:09): I thank the member opposite for his,91
NA,question. The budget is projected to return to balance in 2021. That balance is contingent,91
NA,upon the $40 billion worth of budget improvement measures that are contained in the budget,91
NA,and the forward estimates being passed by this parliament. I am pleased that the Prime,91
NA,Minister has just reminded the House that some $20 billion of that $40 billion has already,91
NA,been passed through this parliament in just these few sitting weeks since the last election.,91
NA,That demonstrates that this government is getting on with the job of implementing our budget,91
NA,"measures. But there remains a further $20 billion, which those opposite remain substantively",91
NA,opposed to. The greatest guarantee for the AAA credit rating that those opposite could give,91
NA,the Australian people is to say that they will support the government's budget savings,91
NA,measures.,91
NA,The government has laid out our plan in the budget. What stands in our way is the refusal,91
NA,"of those opposite to stand up to their economic responsibility, heed the warnings from the",91
NA,ratings agencies and pass the government's budget. But they have an alternative plan! Their,91
NA,view is that the ratings agencies would rush to reaffirm Australia's AAA credit rating if the,91
NA,deficit were to be increased by $16.8 billion. So confident were they that that would be the,91
NA,case that they took a $16½ billion increased deficit to the last election. And what happened at,91
NA,the last election? You took a $16½ billion deficit increase to the last election and it was no,91
NA,surprise that the Australian people rejected you.,91
NA,NA,91
NA,Ms Macklin interjecting-,91
NA,NA,91
The SPEAKER," The member for Moreton and, again, the member for Jagajaga will cease",92
NA,"interjecting. We are heading down a certain track, I fear, with the member for Jagajaga.",92
NA,Budget,92
NA,Mrs SUDMALIS (Gilmore) (14:11): My question also is to the Treasurer. Will the,92
NA,Treasurer update the House on how the government is strengthening Australia's economy by,92
NA,reducing the deficit and arresting debt? Will the Treasurer again explain how important it is,92
NA,that the budget measures currently before parliament are passed to protect Australia's AAA,92
NA,credit rating?,92
Mr MORRISON ,Cook-Treasurer) (14:12): I thank the member for her question and,92
NA,"her keen interest. More importantly, I thank her and those who sit on this side of the House",92
NA,"for their support for the government's budget, which is projected to return to balance in 2021.",92
NA,"But, as I just remarked to the House, there are some impediments that stand in the way of that,",92
NA,and they sit opposite. I turn to none other than the support given by the former Treasurer and,92
NA,"Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who said this earlier this year: 'When Commonwealth revenue",92
NA,"has been so affected, the penny ought to drop; that what we should be doing is cutting",92
NA,"spending. That is what the Treasurer'-referring to myself-'has said for some weeks now,",92
NA,"and on this point he is actually right.' So we have the former Treasurer and Prime Minister,",92
NA,"whom the shadow Treasurer claims is his great mentor, telling him direct, just as the ratings",92
NA,agencies are telling him direct: pass the budget savings measures to ensure the security of,92
NA,Australia's AAA credit rating.,92
NA,"Since 2013, as a government, under both Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister",92
NA,"Turnbull, we have already cut the rate of spending growth from 4.2 per cent, as it was under",92
NA,"the budgets of those opposite, to around 1½ per cent under the budgets of the coalition",92
NA,"government. That is what we have achieved, and that is how we are arresting the debt. But we",92
NA,"are faced with the impediment of those opposite, who would rather spend more and tax more",92
NA,and raise debt to even higher levels than actually face up to their economic responsibility and,92
NA,come into this place and support the government's comprehensive plan to achieve budget,92
NA,"repair. Of the measures that I refer to, we have already been able to pass some $20 billion",92
NA,"worth through this parliament. They include the superannuation measures, which included",92
NA,some $6 billion in additional revenue. That also included $3 billion of investment back into,92
NA,the superannuation system-a world-leading superannuation system-to ensure that it is,92
NA,"fairer, more flexible and sustainable.",92
NA,Those opposite spoke an untruth to the Australian people at the last election. On,92
NA,"superannuation, they said in their own estimates that they would do the same thing as the",92
NA,government when it came to the revenue net position. They did not tell the Australian people,92
NA,that they wanted to tax contributions more. They did not tell those who run home based,92
NA,"businesses, those who are contractors and those who are seeking to catch up on their",92
NA,concessional contributions because they have been carers or they have been having children.,92
NA,They did not tell them they were going to strip those flexibility measures away. They did not,92
NA,tell them that at all. They went to the Australian people and misled them on superannuation,92
NA,"and now, in this parliament, they have made a promise that, at the next election, the only party",92
NA,that is going to be taxing superannuation more is led by the Leader of the Opposition. (Time,92
NA,expired),92
NA,NA,92
NA,Economy,93
Dr CHALMERS ,Rankin) (14:15): My question is also to the Treasurer. Ratings agency,93
NA,Standard & Poor's has today warned that Australia's AAA rating will be at risk unless revenue,93
NA,is increased in a sustained way. Why is the Treasurer refusing to support sensible reforms on,93
NA,negative gearing and capital gains tax?,93
NA,NA,93
The SPEAKER, The Leader of the House will cease interjecting!,93
Mr MORRISON ,Cook-Treasurer) (14:15): Of the $40 billion in budget improvement,93
NA,"measures that we set out in our budget-he is a little excited, though, Mr SPEAKER -that we",93
NA,"took to the Australian people, $25 billion of those measures related to payment savings and",93
NA,$15 billion of those measures related to revenue. There was a balance of the two to ensure that,93
NA,we bring the budget back to balance. We think we got the balance right when it comes to the,93
NA,"balance between taxes and expenditures. As a government we have always ensured that,",93
NA,"where our expenditure has increased, we have offset that with payment savings-not revenue",93
NA,"increases, but payment savings. When we have gone to the Australian people and we have",93
NA,said that we are going to cut taxes-as we have done for personal income tax and legislated,93
NA,"through this place-or when we have gone to the Australian people, as we have said, and we",93
NA,"have said we want businesses, particularly small businesses with a turnover of up to $10",93
NA,"million, to be able to access a lower rate of tax and to access the instant asset write-off and the",93
NA,"pool depreciation provisions, we have offset the cost of revenue-",93
NA,Dr Chalmers interjecting-,93
The SPEAKER, The member for Rankin will cease interjecting. He has asked his,93
NA,question.,93
Mr MORRISON, with other revenue measures. That is how you actually drive yourself,93
NA,towards a budget balance. But those opposite are a one-trick pony when it comes to the,93
NA,"budget, and the only thing that they are able to come up with is to tax people more. They are",93
NA,"addicted to tax and, rather than try and ease the burden on Australian businesses so they can",93
NA,"give Australians more opportunity for more hours, they just want to keep squeezing that tax",93
NA,lemon as hard as they possibly can. That presents a great threat to our economy.,93
NA,"The United Kingdom will bring down their autumn statement tonight, and we already",93
NA,know that they have put the UK on a trajectory to one of the lowest tax rates in the advanced,93
NA,"world. We know that the Trump administration will be seeking to do exactly the same thing,",93
NA,and we have already moved in our budget to take Australia down a similar path. Those,93
NA,opposite plan to strand Australian businesses in a high-tax environment where they cannot,93
NA,"invest, where they cannot attract capital and where they cannot provide additional working",93
NA,hours and additional wages to working Australians.,93
NA,"This is a leader of the opposition who, rather than following the economic policy advice of",93
NA,"Bob Hawke, has become an acolyte of Bob Brown when it comes to economic policy. He is",93
NA,"the Jeremy Corbyn of Australian politics, appealing to the Bernie Sanders and all the rest of",93
NA,them. This is a leader of the opposition who is so indulgent in cynical politics that he cannot,93
NA,find his way to the surface again.,93
NA,NA,93
NA,Water,94
Mr KATTER ,Kennedy) (14:19): My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Deputy,94
NA,"Prime Minister, you are aware of the notorious Flinders River water allocations. Almost all of",94
NA,"these waters, worth over $180 million, have been granted to just two absentee landlord",94
NA,corporations. This was in contrast to refusal to even consider submissions from the people of,94
NA,"the area itself that were based upon economic development, industry and community benefit.",94
NA,The most serious questions of ministerial and departmental impropriety are raised here. In the,94
NA,"light of this impoverishment of the hands on to provide for the enrichment of the rich, would",94
NA,the minister consider right to sustenance legislation-rights enshrined in and from the time of,94
NA,the Magna Carta itself?,94
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and,94
NA,Water Resources) (14:19): I thank the honourable member for his question. At times I stay up,94
NA,late at night deliberating on the issues of Runnymede in 1215 and exactly what was going on,94
NA,"between King John and those feudal lords. I do acknowledge that, after a few months, they",94
NA,"broke out into a war in any case, so it was not of much use. But he does speak to a rather more",94
NA,substantial issue-the issue of water. Predominantly-,94
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,94
The SPEAKER," Members on my left, and right. The Minister for Immigration and the",94
NA,member for Grayndler are interrupting the minister.,94
NA,NA,94
NA,An honourable member: He wrote it!,94
The SPEAKER, The Leader of the House will cease interjecting. The Deputy Prime,94
NA,Minister has the call.,94
Mr JOYCE," I take the interjection from the member for Grayndler, who is claiming that",94
NA,"he built the Magna Carta. But the issue, of course, is one of water. The water licences for the",94
NA,"member for Kennedy are overwhelmingly a state issue, especially on the Flinders. I note the",94
NA,concerns you have. We too are wanting to develop the north and to build more water,94
NA,"infrastructure. It is vitally important, and that is why we have put up money for feasibility on",94
NA,"14 sites in Queensland and $130 million on the table for Rookwood Weir. Unfortunately, the",94
NA,Queensland Labor government has been either tardy or unwilling to participate in it-we are,94
NA,still waiting for their support so we can get these things moving. Also in the member's,94
NA,"electorate is one of those feasibility studies, at Cloncurry. We have to try and drive these",94
NA,"agendas forward, because we know that water is wealth and, if we are driving jobs and",94
NA,"creating jobs, we have to create the water infrastructure.",94
NA,The member for Kennedy can take some solace in the fact that we are hard at work in,94
NA,Tasmania building that same water infrastructure. We have completed Chaffey Dam. We have,94
NA,also put money on the table for the South-West Loddon Pipeline and for the Macalister,94
NA,Irrigation District. These programs are up and running and we want to start more. We want to,94
NA,go further. We want to be the government that has the vision to build the water infrastructure.,94
NA,"I appreciate the trip that I took with the member for Kennedy to Hell's Gates, where we",94
NA,also have put money on the table for the feasibility study on that. That would be a tremendous,94
NA,"project. But we need the same sense of fervour, the same sense of excitement as we have seen",94
NA,from the people who built the Snowy Mountains scheme. That is the sort of vision that our,94
NA,NA,94
NA,"nation is looking for. That is the sort of vision that people want from a government, a",95
NA,"government that actually believes in the delivery of the tactile, in the things that you can see,",95
NA,rather than standing on their philosophical log and procrastinating and just waiting and,95
NA,waiting and waiting until nothing happens.,95
NA,"So, if it is the vision that you had on 15 June 1215 at Runnymede, where not-so-good King",95
NA,"John was taken on by the not-so-good feudal lords, then that is the sort of vision. But,",95
NA,"ultimately, the document was sustainable through time, and we want to build the water",95
NA,infrastructure that is sustainable through time for the Australian people.,95
NA,Australian Building and Construction Commission,95
Mr HOGAN ,Page) (14:23): My question is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for,95
NA,Agriculture and Water Resources. Will the Deputy Prime Minister explain to the House how,95
NA,forcing the rule of law on construction sites through the reintroduction of the ABCC will,95
NA,benefit the hardworking Australians I represent in the agricultural industry?,95
Mr JOYCE ,New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and,95
NA,Water Resources) (14:23): I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. He is a,95
NA,person who understands the benefit to the Australian working man and woman from the,95
NA,production of food and from the delivery and processing of food. We note-in areas such as,95
NA,macadamia production that he has in his electorate-the great jobs that are produced not only,95
NA,by the farmers but also by the people who are processing the macadamias. That is also the,95
NA,case in the Casino cooperative meatworks. I commend the work he has been doing with,95
NA,cooperatives-those meatworks employing working men and women and making sure that,95
NA,they have the capacity to go home with a fair day's pay after a fair day's work.,95
NA,"But, unfortunately, from time to time we have an impediment in trying to bring forth these",95
NA,"jobs that are so essential to the Australian economy. We note, for instance, the $280-or-so",95
NA,million that was put aside to build the Melbourne wholesale fruit and vegetable markets.,95
NA,"Unfortunately, when they went to build it, there was a bit of fight. You would think it would",95
NA,"be about the farmers wanting it bigger. No, it was between the member for Griffith's crowd,",95
NA,"the CFMEU, and the member for Maribyrnong crowd, the AWU. They went to fight and just",95
NA,"kept fighting and fighting and fighting, until in the end the ABCC took them to the Federal",95
NA,"Court and ordered that they remove the blockades, which were costing millions of dollars, and",95
NA,that they get back to work.,95
NA,So what do they do when the court of the land says to go back to work? You would think,95
NA,"they would obey that order. No, they did not. The CFMEU was obviously above the law.",95
NA,"They do not have to comply with the law. That is for the regular men and women of Australia,",95
NA,not the CFMEU. They can just make their own arrangements. We saw it again with the desal,95
NA,"plant, where the CFMEU went on strike, costing $5 million a day.",95
NA,The issue for the member for Page and for everybody here is that we must believe in the,95
NA,"rule of law. We cannot have mum-and-dad operators going onto worksites, being bullied by",95
NA,"thugs who stand over them, thugs whose belief is not in a fair day's work and a fair day's pay,",95
NA,but just in extorting money and extorting ridiculous conditions out of it.,95
NA,"The Labor Party would be the champion of the CFMEU, with the member for Griffiths",95
NA,"involved in the CFMEU, the member for Shortland involved in the CFMEU, and the member",95
NA,"for Calwell involved in the CFMEU. These are part of the process, and they are paying their",95
NA,NA,95
NA,dues here at the moment. They are paying their dues to make sure that they deliver back to the,96
NA,"CFMEU, who has also delivered millions of dollars to the Australian Labor Party. The",96
NA,problem with the Labor Party these days is there are not many labourers in it. There are an,96
NA,awful lot of union officials but not many labourers. But we will make sure that we give our,96
NA,very best endeavours to get the cop back on the beat.,96
NA,Taxation,96
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (14:26): My question is to the,96
NA,Prime Minister. Today ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned that Australia's AAA credit,96
NA,rating will be at risk unless the government stands by its commitment to a surplus in 2021. On,96
NA,"this basis, why is the Prime Minister still persisting with his $50 billion tax handout to big",96
NA,"business, when a ratings downgrade will push up the mortgage repayments for Australian",96
NA,homeowners?,96
NA,Mrs Sudmalis interjecting-,96
The SPEAKER, Members on my right. The member for Gilmore.,96
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (14:27): There was a time when the,96
NA,"Labor Party understood-indeed, a prominent figure on the opposition benches wrote a book",96
NA,"about it-that reducing company tax, reducing businesses taxes, would, because it increased",96
NA,"the return on investment, deliver more investment. And, if you get more investment-do you",96
NA,know what?-you get more jobs.,96
NA,Around the world companies are reducing business taxes. We pointed to the policies of the,96
NA,incoming administration in the United States. You can look at what the UK government has,96
NA,done. That has been a policy followed by Labor governments in this place as well for the,96
NA,"obvious reason: if you increase the return on investment, you get more investment.",96
NA,Turning to the ratings agencies: the ratings agencies have been absolutely crystal clear.,96
NA,Their concern is that the government's budget will not be passed through the parliament,96
NA,because of the reckless opposition of the Labor Party. That is what their concern is. They,96
NA,recognise that we have an economic plan that sets out a path towards a budget surplus. They,96
NA,"recognise that and they accept it. Their concern is the political risk, and that is why they",96
NA,"welcomed the omnibus savings bill, that is why they welcomed the passage of the",96
NA,"superannuation reforms, and that is why they have welcomed our ability, when it is there, to",96
NA,secure our budget policies through the Senate.,96
NA,"But we work very hard and respectfully and constructively with the crossbench, and we",96
NA,will continue to do so. But the Labor Party know very well that any and every measure in that,96
NA,"budget can be passed if they support it, and it is their opposition which puts the AA rating at",96
NA,risk. It is the political risk-,96
NA,An honourable member: You're the government!,96
Mr TURNBULL," The honourable member says, 'You're the government.' You're quite",96
NA,right. That is something you have not quite twigged to yet. We are the government; we won,96
NA,"the election. The reality is: you cannot turn around and say to us, 'You're at risk of the AAA",96
NA,"rating being pulled because of the rating agencies,' when the risk that the rating agencies",96
NA,identified is that the government's plan will not get through the Senate because of the,96
NA,"trenchant political opposition of the Labor Party. So, if the Labor Party are concerned about",96
NA,NA,96
NA,the AAA rating and if they want to support the AAA rating-and we would be grateful for,97
NA,"it-then they should support the budget measures, because their passage will secure it.",97
NA,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,97
NA,The SPEAKER (14:30): I would like to inform the House that we have present in the,97
NA,chamber this afternoon a delegation from Cambodia led by his excellency Mr Kimyeat. On,97
NA,behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to you.,97
NA,"Honourable members: Hear, hear!",97
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,97
NA,Economy,97
Mr CREWTHER ,Dunkley) (14:30): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer,97
NA,"advise the House on the importance of strong economic growth to employment security, job",97
NA,creation and wage growth for hardworking Australians? How important is it that the,97
NA,government continues to promote productivity and reduce inefficiencies that drag on our,97
NA,economy?,97
Mr MORRISON ,Cook-Treasurer) (14:31): I thank the member for Dunkley for his,97
NA,question and for his support for the measures that this government is seeking and introducing,97
NA,"to ensure greater productivity in the Australia economy, because from that comes the growth,",97
NA,"the investment, the jobs and the wages. The way you lift revenue in this country, if you want",97
NA,"to budget balance, is: you need to ensure that businesses are earning more, that employees are",97
NA,earning more and that they are getting extra hours. To do that you need a tax environment,97
NA,"which supports business, particularly small business, to achieve that. But you also need an",97
NA,environment in the building and construction industry that when businesses and others go and,97
NA,invest they are not hit with a 30 percent premium as a result of the lawlessness in the building,97
NA,and construction industry.,97
NA,I notice that the member for Grayndler has said very recently-I understand it was last,97
NA,night-that now was the time for the Commonwealth to lift investment right across the,97
NA,"nation. It might be news to the member for Grayndler that, under the Labor Party,",97
NA,Commonwealth investment as a share of public investment was an average of 24 per cent.,97
NA,"Under this government, it is an average of 30½ per cent. So this government has been lifting",97
NA,"investment in Commonwealth investment, but investment particularly in public infrastructure",97
NA,is hampered by those opposite who continue to frustrate and work against the restoration of,97
NA,the Australian Building and Construction Commission.,97
NA,"Yesterday, I asked a very polite question to those opposite of those who happen to be",97
NA,members of registered trade unions. And none of them put their hands up. I asked them: 'Who,97
NA,"are members of the CFMEU?' So, Mr Speaker, I thought this may be a reason as to why in",97
NA,unions' interests they may be seeking to protect the lawlessness in the building and,97
NA,construction industry on behalf of militant unions. So I did a bit of homework. It turns out that,97
NA,when you look at the Register of Members' Interests of the 68 members of parliament who sit,97
NA,opposite only 32 have not listed any union membership at all on their register of interests.,97
NA,"That is interesting because when I look at the membership form of the ALP, which is a",97
NA,"requirement, it says 'member of affiliated union'. So why is it that the member for Batman",97
NA,thinks it is important to declare a 1/400 scale model of a Shortfin Barracuda submarine but he,97
NA,NA,97
NA,"does not think it is relevant to disclose the fact of his membership, as others have on that side,",98
NA,of a trade union?,98
NA,If we go to the actual register of interests question-and I happen have the member for,98
NA,"MCMahon's here. Strangely enough, he has not mentioned what union he is a member of. I am",98
NA,glad to know that he is a member of the Marconi club and the Guildford West leagues-they,98
NA,are fine institutions; great clubs-but he has not mentioned what union he is a member of.,98
NA,And question 13 says 'membership of any organisation'-(Time expired),98
NA,Superannuation,98
Ms PLIBERSEK ,Sydney-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:34): My question is to,98
NA,the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. It has been revealed that Australia's biggest,98
NA,banks will have to pay almost $180 million in compensation because they spent years,98
NA,"charging over 200,000 customers fees for services that they did not actually receive. Is this",98
NA,what the minister meant when she said she wanted to lift superannuation funds to the same,98
NA,standards as banks? Does the minister really want superannuation account holders to be,98
NA,treated the way banks treat their customers?,98
Ms ODWYER ,Higgins-Minister for Revenue and Financial Services) (14:35): I thank,98
NA,"the member for her question. I note that she believes, along with those opposite, that it is",98
NA,"incredibly important that the mandated superannuation system, in which we force people to",98
NA,defer their wages that they earn today to save for their retirement income into the future-,98
NA,they think it is acceptable that it has lower governance standards than that that currently apply,98
NA,to banks and life insurance companies. It is ridiculous to think that millions of Australians,98
NA,who have their money in superannuation funds would have funds that have lower governance,98
NA,standards than what currently applies to banks and to life insurance companies.,98
NA,Mr Brendan O'Connor interjecting-,98
The SPEAKER, The member for Gorton!,98
Ms ODWYER, It is not actually something that we have dreamt up on this side of the,98
NA,"House. In fact, there was a review that was undertaken under Labor's watch by Jeremy",98
NA,Cooper-a handpicked person from Labor for the job-who concluded that the governance,98
NA,standards for superannuation funds was not up to the mark. He said that there needed to be at,98
NA,least one-third of independent directors on these boards.,98
NA,A second review conducted by David Murray said that there needed to be a majority of,98
NA,independent directors and an independent chair on these boards. It is so unacceptable to think,98
NA,that all of the problems that could occur within these funds can continue without there being,98
NA,appropriate oversight.,98
NA,Let me just quote a couple of other people who think that this might be a good idea. Ken,98
NA,"Henry, who was the former adviser to Paul Keating and former Treasury secretary, has been",98
NA,reported as saying it was time that industry funds accepted the need for new governance,98
NA,standards as advocated by the government. He said that the trade union movement should be,98
NA,"proud of the system it created, but that the argument that, 'The system isn't broken, so why fix",98
NA,it?' was a bit like saying that a house that had not been torched should not have insurance.,98
NA,"Paul Howes, the former Australian Workers' Union boss, has said:",98
NA,NA,98
NA,It has been disappointing to see a knee-jerk reaction against the call for a more independent governance,99
NA,model … Equal representation has been a success but the evolution of the super industry is important,99
NA,and I can't see anything negative in having more independents on boards.,99
NA,Those on that side of the House want to protect their union mates and union bosses in,99
NA,"maintaining access to slush funds. We think it is completely and utterly inappropriate, and we",99
NA,"will stand up for members, we will stand up for what is right for them and we will stand up",99
NA,for their interests.,99
NA,Workplace Health and Safety,99
Mr COLEMAN ,"Banks) (14:38): My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry,",99
NA,representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister explain why it is critical to,99
NA,maintain a consistent approach to occupational health and safety in the workplace and how,99
NA,that will be assisted by the establishment of the Registered Organisations Commission and the,99
NA,Australian Building and Construction Commission?,99
NA,NA,99
NA,thank the member for Banks for his question. It is a very important question because,99
NA,occupational health and safety-a safe workplace-is the most important priority in every,99
NA,"single workplace in Australia for employers and, equally, employees. The first task of every",99
NA,"business is to ensure that their employees are in a safe workplace, and it is one of the most",99
NA,"important requirements of unions, of course, to represent their members to ensure that they",99
NA,"are in safe workplaces. That, of course, is the reason why the Labor Party should support the",99
NA,"Registered Organisations Commission being established, which they have tried to oppose and",99
NA,"failed this week, which is why it is an important signature reform. It is why they should",99
NA,support the Australian Building and Construction Commission-because healthy unions are,99
NA,good for their members. Honest union leaders looking after their members rather than lining,99
NA,their pockets should be the outcome that every member in this House should be seeking.,99
NA,So I find very strange indeed the hypocrisy-the hideous hypocrisy-that members of the,99
NA,"Labor Party, and particularly this Leader of the Opposition, show in their feigned concern",99
NA,"about safety in the workplace for workers, when in fact the Leader of the Opposition",99
NA,"deliberately parachuted into the Senate Kimberley Kitching to become Senator Kitching, who",99
NA,is alleged to have fraudulently filled out the safety tests for six union leaders in the Health,99
NA,Services Union. So they had a captain's pick where the Leader of the Opposition put,99
NA,"Kimberley Kitching, Senator Kitching, into the Senate when the trade union royal",99
NA,"commission has referred her to the Commonwealth DPP for fraudulently, it is alleged, filling",99
NA,out the safety tests for six union leaders from the Health Services Union and bragging about,99
NA,"it. That put union leaders into workplaces, pretending that they had done the safety tests and",99
NA,safety standards that were necessary to go into those worksites but knowing that they did not,99
NA,have those safety standards that are required.,99
NA,That reckless decision by the Leader of the Opposition was made over the complaints and,99
NA,"the outrage of many members of his frontbench, particularly the member for Isaacs. The",99
NA,"member for Isaacs, as I understand it, threatened to resign if Kimberley Kitching was",99
NA,"appointed to the Senate. If that is not true, he is quite welcome to say that he was",99
NA,"misrepresented and explain the facts, because that is the very strong story that is circulating.",99
NA,Over the objections of former Senator Conroy and the objections of members of the right-,99
NA,"wing faction from his own state, he put into the Senate a person who had fraudulently filled",99
NA,NA,99
NA,"out the tests, it is alleged, of union leaders, putting workers in danger in the workplace. That",100
NA,is the real respect they have for workers' safety. (Time expired),100
NA,Superannuation,100
Mr BOWEN ,"MCMahon) (14:41): My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday, the",100
NA,Minister for Revenue and Financial Services said she wanted to lift superannuation funds to,100
NA,the same standards as the banks. So is the former New South Wales Liberal leader and,100
NA,"chairman of Industry Super Australia, Peter Collins, accurately describing government policy",100
NA,when he says:,100
NA,"If super funds had been responsible for systemic failures in financial advice, failure to pass on interest",100
NA,"rate cuts, excessive executive remuneration and other forms of profit gouging by banks, there would",100
NA,have been a royal commission into super funds in a flash.,100
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (14:42): The honourable member knows,100
NA,very well that the government has sought to ensure that there are independent directors on,100
NA,industry super funds. That is hardly a radical proposal. This has been resisted by a number of,100
NA,"the vested interests associated with the industry super funds, where, in many cases, as the",100
NA,"honourable member knows, the directors are drawn solely from the employers and the unions.",100
NA,All we are seeking to do is to install what is regarded as corporate governance 101 in the rest,100
NA,of the corporate world. The honourable member should take care to represent the interests of,100
NA,"the members as opposed to, once again, representing the interests of union bosses, who are",100
NA,very happy to sit in those well-paid directorships.,100
NA,Aged Care,100
Mr ALEXANDER ,Bennelong) (14:43): My question is to the Minister for Health and,100
NA,Aged Care. Will the minister explain to the House how a re-established Australian Building,100
NA,and Construction Commission will ensure hardworking Australians receive the aged-care,100
NA,services they deserve? What is standing in the way of this progress?,100
Ms LEY ,Farrer-Minister for Sport and Minister for Health and Aged Care) (14:43):,100
NA,Thank you to the member for Bennelong for his question about the important subject of aged,100
NA,"care-in particular, aged-care residential facilities. I would just like to provide the House with",100
NA,"a demonstration of our investment in this important policy area. This year, it is estimated that",100
NA,"Commonwealth funding in residential aged care will be about $65,000 per resident. This year,",100
NA,aged-care spending is estimated at $17½ billion-that is actually 20 per cent higher than it,100
NA,"was in Labor's last budget, at least. Since June 2015, there has been an increase of about 3½",100
NA,thousand operational residential aged-care places. Aged-care spending is increasing by an,100
NA,average of 6.7 per cent a year. With this ageing population and a figure that is only going to,100
NA,"grow, it is important that we have adequate facilities to support Australians who need",100
NA,residential care and the ability for those Australians to access that care as soon as possible.,100
NA,New facilities are being built around the country. In many cases it is a partnership with,100
NA,"government capital investment and investment from the private sector. Unfortunately, the",100
NA,sites for these much-needed facilities are not immune to union thuggery that all construction,100
NA,sites face. I have an example which was reported in The Age in April this year: The Age,100
NA,"reported that, on an aged-care construction site in Templestowe, Victoria, up to 30 workers",100
NA,"simply walked off the job, just like that. The company allegedly told the CFMEU officer",100
NA,"present, 'What you have done is illegal, and I am going to have to report you,' to which the",100
NA,NA,100
NA,"CFMEU officer allegedly responded, 'I know it's illegal, but I had to do it.' This is so wrong",101
NA,on so many levels. It just goes to show that the unions that are holding our construction sites,101
NA,to ransom can do these things just because they feel like it. We are committed to restoring law,101
NA,and order-,101
NA,Ms Collins interjecting-,101
The SPEAKER, The member for Franklin will cease interjecting.,101
Ms LEY, on construction sites. Whenever I hear about elderly Australians unable to get a,101
NA,residential aged-care place or that place costing more in terms of the capital to build because,101
NA,"of the union thuggeries, I know that not enough is being done by this Labor Party to sort out",101
NA,the union bosses who are running the show. We only have to reflect on the words of the trade,101
NA,union royal commission-,101
NA,Ms Plibersek interjecting-,101
NA,Ms Collins interjecting-,101
The SPEAKER, The member for Sydney and the member for Franklin.,101
Ms LEY," about the systemic world of louts, thugs, bullies, thieves and perjurers. This is",101
NA,across the board. It is operating in a construction site near each one of these Labor Party,101
NA,"members. None of them are doing anything about it, but what it is doing is affecting the aged-",101
NA,"care places, the residential funding and the cost for those everyday Australians. (Time",101
NA,expired),101
NA,Murray-Darling Basin,101
Mr GEORGANAS ,Hindmarsh) (14:46): My question is to the Prime Minister. The,101
NA,member for Mallee said the Deputy Prime Minister was right to abandon the bipartisan,101
NA,"commitment for an additional 450 gigalitres in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan saying, 'South",101
NA,Australia will get more water than it can actually handle.' Is it the position of the government,101
NA,that the Basin Plan delivers more water than South Australia can actually handle?,101
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (14:47): I thank the honourable member.,101
NA,I have the Basin Plan here which I will refer to in a moment. The Australian government is,101
NA,committed to delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full and on time. Our policy has,101
NA,not changed. The Basin Plan is based on an approach to water management that delivers a,101
NA,"healthy basin and supports productive industries, confident communities and a resilient",101
NA,environment.,101
NA,There are challenges in delivering anything as complex as the Basin Plan. What we need to,101
NA,"remember is that, in delivering additional water for the environment, the sustainability of",101
NA,communities in economic and social terms must be preserved. I will refer the honourable,101
NA,member to section 7.17 of the Basin Plan. What it makes very clear is that it must be neutral,101
NA,or improved socioeconomic outcomes associated with the conversion of water from,101
NA,consumptive to environmental uses. That is what is in the plan; that is what the plan says.,101
NA,"Nobody is saying it is easy. I think it was Mark Twain that said, 'Whiskey is for drinking;",101
NA,water is for fighting over'-I remember it very well; I was the water minister. I understand,101
NA,because the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was put in place when I was the water minister under,101
NA,John Howard.,101
NA,Ms Rishworth interjecting-,101
NA,NA,101
The SPEAKER, The member for Kingston.,102
Mr TURNBULL," It is always contentious, but the reality is that what we have to do is to",102
NA,find the solutions and the mechanisms that enable us to return water to the environment in a,102
NA,way that does not disadvantage basin communities in social or economic forms. There will,102
NA,"always be arguments about water. There will always be disputes about water, but where there",102
NA,"is goodwill and a dynamic, constructive approach then we will be able-",102
NA,Ms Rishworth interjecting-,102
The SPEAKER, The member for Kingston will cease interjecting.,102
Mr TURNBULL, to deliver the plan in full as we are committed to. What I would invite,102
NA,the honourable member to do is to work with us and to encourage his colleagues in the South,102
NA,Australian government to work with us. Some of the language that was used by the South,102
NA,"Australian water minister, I have to say, was not constructive and not calculated to assist in",102
NA,resolution.,102
NA,"The bottom line is this: we are committed to the plan, but the plan has provisions. The",102
NA,provision I just read out to the honourable member is very clear. The honourable member for,102

Ms BANKS ,"Chisholm) (14:50): My question is to the Minister for Industry, Innovation",102
NA,and Science. Will the minister update the House on what the government is doing to promote,102
NA,"Australian industry, business and jobs for hardworking Australians? Is the minister aware of",102
NA,"any alternative approaches that would hurt Australian industry, business and jobs?",102
Mr HUNT ,"Flinders-Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (14:50): I want to",102
NA,thank the member and acknowledge that she comes to this place not just as the victor of,102
NA,Chisholm but also as somebody who has had a distinguished career in businesses that are,102
NA,providing jobs for numerous Australians. As part of that work she has been passionate about,102
NA,"creating job opportunities for Australians. In that light, I am pleased to inform the House that",102
NA,"last Thursday the member for Reid, in his capacity as assistant minister, and I met with all of",102
NA,the states and territories and achieved exactly what the Prime Minister was talking about: a,102
NA,"good working relationship and an outcome where all of the Labor states and territories, as",102
NA,"well as the coalition states and territories, agreed on a national business simplification",102
NA,"initiative aimed at creating jobs, so unanimity across the jurisdictions with the federal",102
NA,government. Examples of what we are proposing to do to create jobs include: working with,102
NA,New South Wales on bringing down the time for formation of a cafe from 18 months to 3,102
NA,months; working with South Australia on food-handling standards and simplifying those;,102
NA,working with Victoria on creating faster approaches to registering and starting retail,102
NA,"businesses; working with Tasmania on ecotourism being expedited; and, working with",102
NA,Queensland on faster approaches to registering and creating agricultural and manufacturing,102
NA,businesses. Real action that will create jobs.,102
NA,That has been twinned this week with the work of the parliament in passing the Registered,102
NA,Organisations Commission bill and the progress that is being made on the ABCC-two things,102
NA,NA,102
NA,that will assist in not just establishing businesses but in allowing the construction to go ahead,103
NA,that is necessary to house these businesses.,103
NA,I am asked if there are alternatives to this approach of actually creating job and actually,103
NA,"allowing businesses to be created. And, yes, there are. Our friends on the other side are",103
NA,resolutely opposed to any action that will rein in union tyranny and thuggery in the,103
NA,"workplace. Let me give you an example. Moose Toys, the Australian based maker of Betty",103
NA,"Spaghetty and Little Live Pets, which, of course, the CFMEU uses as a way of referring to",103
NA,Bill and Burkie.,103
The SPEAKER, The Minister for the Environment will refer to members by their correct,103
NA,titles.,103
Mr HUNT, I apologise. I withdraw. Moose Toys was accused and threatened on site with,103
NA,"the phrase by a CFMEU official, 'You do not want to be the dog who calls the cop on a union",103
NA,official.' Why would they tolerate that sort of intimidation of an Australian business. The,103
NA,reason is that they stand for the thugs. They do not stand for the businesses. We are creating,103
NA,jobs to make it simpler to do business. (Time expired),103

NA,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (14:54): My question is to the Prime Minister. I,103
NA,refer to the video of a Brisbane 7-Eleven employee being forced to return half her wages to,103
NA,"her employer in cash. As a result of this cashback scam, staff are paid $11 an hour below the",103
NA,minimum wage. Given the Prime Minister's own ministerial standards requires ministers to,103
NA,"act with the highest standards of integrity, how can the Prime Minister possibly justify his",103
NA,ongoing holdings in managed funds that invest in 7-Eleven?,103
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,103
The SPEAKER, Members on my right. The member for Wakefield will cease,103
NA,interjecting.,103
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (14:54): As honourable members are,103
NA,"aware, my and my wife's investments are managed for us by an external adviser. They are",103
NA,"invested almost entirely-for the most part in any event-in large managed funds, typically",103
NA,"index funds, exchange traded funds, that have a wide range of investments. Typically, very",103
NA,"similar to the large superannuation funds that many other members, including members",103
NA,"opposite, have their funds invested in.",103
NA,What I would suggest to the honourable member is that he now scour through the large,103
NA,portfolios of all the managed funds that are opposite. But the point of the matter is that I do,103
NA,"not choose the stocks those funds invest in. I am completely transparent. They are there, and",103
NA,the allocation of the funds is a matter for my adviser. So it is kept very much at arms-length,103
NA,from me. It is thoroughly transparent and at arm's length.,103
NA,National Security,103
Ms MARINO ,Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (14:56): My question is the Minister,103
NA,for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the house on steps the,103
NA,government has taken to secure our borders and achieve third-country resettlement pathways?,103
NA,Is the minister aware of any alternative approach?,103
NA,NA,103
Mr DUTTON ,Dickson-Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (14:56): I,104
NA,"thank the honourable member for her question. It is a particularly import question, because, as",104
NA,"we all know, people smugglers have not gone out of business. Right now, people smugglers",104
NA,"are trying to get people to pay money to hop onto boats. Tragically, we know the outcome if",104
NA,"we lose control of our borders, because it was evidenced over the six years of the Rudd-",104
NA,"Gillard-Rudd years, when the Leader of the Opposition was a senior member within that",104
NA,"cabinet. There were 1,200 people, including women and children, who drowned at sea. There",104
NA,"were thousands and thousands of children put into detention. It was the case that 50,000",104
NA,"people arrived on 800 boats, and we are still cleaning up Labor's mess.",104
NA,"Having got the children out of detention, having closed the 17 detention centres, having not",104
NA,"had a successful people smuggling venture arrive in over 800 days now, and having fixed up",104
NA,this mess and this sad chapter in Labor history-,104
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,104
The SPEAKER," Member for Wakefield, this is your final warning.",104
Mr DUTTON, -our determination is to get women and children and all those people on,104
NA,"Nauru and Manus off those two islands, but to do it in such a way that we do not recommence",104
NA,"boat arrivals. I do not want new arrivals to fill the vacancies we create, which is the policy",104
NA,prescription that Labor is putting forward. We have had Homeland Security and State,104
NA,Department representatives from the United States in Australia over the course of the last,104
NA,week or so talking through with officials from my department ways in which we can screen,104
NA,people very quickly and facilitate their removal. I do not want the people smugglers to hear,104
NA,"the weak message being conveyed by the Leader of the Opposition, as we have seen over the",104
NA,course of the last couple of weeks.,104
NA,The Leader of the Opposition is intent on creating whatever distraction he can. But the,104
NA,reality remains that this Leader of the Opposition presides over a weak and divided party.,104
NA,They were weak and divided when they were in government and they are weak and divided,104
NA,"now. The people smugglers saw a weak leader in Kevin Rudd, they saw a weak leader in Julia",104
NA,Gillard and they know this Leader of the Opposition is at least as weak as they are.,104
NA,I see notification today that the policy unit of the Labor Party has been taken over by the,104
NA,"left of this party. That is a terrible development, because the people smugglers were rubbing",104
NA,"their hands together when Labor was last in power, because the fact is that the left of the party",104
NA,completely dominate this border protection policy. That is why 26 people in the Labor Party,104
NA,came out against the legislation the government has passed through the Lower House. At,104
NA,"every opportunity, this Leader of the Opposition shows that he is unfit to be Prime Minister of",104
NA,"this country and, if he were to be elected at the next election, as sure as night follows day, the",104
NA,boats would restart.,104
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,104
The SPEAKER, The members on my left will cease interjecting. I gave the member for,104
NA,Wakefield his final warning. He kept interjecting; he can leave under standing order 94(a).,104

Mr BURKE ,Watson-Manager of Opposition Business) (14:59): My question is directed,105
NA,to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that his government has threatened to,105
NA,"sue Mark Rogers, a Sydney grandfather, over his use of the Medicare logo on his Save",105
NA,Medicare website. Will the government also be threatening legal action against the Liberal,105
NA,"Party, the member for Forde, the Minister for Trade, the member for Bonner and the health",105

The SPEAKER, The Manager of Opposition business knows the rules on props. The,105
NA,members on my left and right will cease interjecting.,105

NA,Domestic and Family Violence,105
Ms HENDERSON ,Corangamite) (15:00): My question is to the Minister for Social,105
NA,Services. Will the minister update the House on what the government is doing to provide,105
NA,support services to people affected by family and domestic violence. How important is it that,105
NA,the government provides these services in our community?,105
NA,NA,105
NA,"question on this very important issue. Of course, on 28 October of this year, the Prime",105
NA,Minister announced $100 million worth of support to the third action plan for reducing,105
NA,"violence against women, and, in September of 2015, the Prime Minister announced a $100",105
NA,million Women's Safety Package. The question was directed to the way in which these fund,105
NA,important services. Perhaps there is no more important service being funded with this very,105
NA,"large increase in funding, which has been made possible by the commitment of the Prime",105
NA,"Minister, than the 1800RESPECT hotline. That translates to practical assistance for women in",105
NA,"need, on the ground. Since its inception, the hotline has been-",105
NA,Mr Hill interjecting-,105
The SPEAKER, The member for Bruce.,105
NA,NA,105
NA,"counsellors from the rape and domestic violence services. Since 2010, there has been a much",105
NA,greater awareness of the issue and that has given rise to a greater number of people wanting to,105
NA,"use this hotline. That is, in itself, a measure of some success as awareness increases.",105
NA,"The unfortunate outcome, however, was that, before we undertook recent reforms, the call",105
NA,"wait time had blown out to over 10 minutes, which had meant that a whole range of women",105
NA,"who were seeking assistance had actually given up waiting, and the call abandonment rate had",105
NA,"lifted to 44 per cent. As a government, with the funding that the Prime Minister allocated, we",105
NA,"did three things. Firstly, we commissioned an independent report to look into best practice",105
NA,"models here and overseas. Secondly, we worked with Medibank Health Solutions to try and",105
NA,tailor the single best practical option that we could institute here. That option involved a first,105
NA,"responder triage model, so that the first person you would talk to would be someone with at",105
NA,least a three-year degree qualification in a relevant tertiary field plus a minimum of two years,105
NA,"experience in counselling. If you needed specialist trauma counselling, you were seamlessly",105
NA,NA,105
NA,"directed to that at the very point of the phone call. Thirdly, we steeled ourselves to what is,",106
NA,"inevitably, the level of criticism you get when you engage in reform of this nature. Ms Jenna",106
NA,"Price, through the Sydney Morning Herald, said that this would destroy 1800RESPECT. The",106
NA,"member for Griffith, in agreeing with that, said that the changes were terrible and that they",106
NA,would divert people away-,106

The SPEAKER, The member for Moreton.,106
NA,NA,106
NA,to know that these have been the results: 80 per cent of calls are now answered in 20 seconds.,106
NA,The average call wait time has dropped from over 10 minutes to 35 seconds. The call,106
NA,abandonment rate in this incredibly important area has dropped from 44 per cent to 5.5 per,106
NA,"cent. They are not terrible changes, as we were led to believe by the member for Griffith in",106
NA,the context of the election campaign; they are tremendous changes that help women in their,106
NA,greatest time of need when domestic violence- (Time expired),106
NA,Murray-Darling Basin,106
Mr BURKE ,Watson-Manager of Opposition Business) (15:04): My question is to the,106
NA,Prime Minister. When the Deputy Prime Minister personally insisted on receiving the water,106
NA,"portfolio in September 2015, did he keep secret from the Prime Minister his intention to",106
NA,undermine the additional 450 gigalitres in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan? Did the Prime,106
NA,Minister have any idea prior to Friday that his deputy had put in writing that the Basin Plan,106
NA,"would not be completed, and since then, has the Prime Minister, in any way, reprimanded the",106
NA,Deputy Prime Minister for free ranging on the Basin Plan?,106
NA,Mr Hunt interjecting-,106
The SPEAKER," The Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science.",106
Mr TURNBULL ,"Wentworth-Prime Minister) (15:04): Characteristically, from the",106
NA,"opposition, we have one misrepresentation after another. The fact is the government is",106
NA,"committed to the Basin Plan. If I may just remind honourable members, the section I referred",106
NA,"to from the Basin Plan was from the Basin Plan 2012, so this is a plan that the honourable",106
NA,"member is very familiar with. Indeed, I see here on the front page:",106
NA,"I, Tony Burke, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities…",106
NA,"Gosh, no wonder he was so busy with all of those things to do. He could not pay attention to",106
NA,"water. There it is. This is the plan the honourable member promulgated as minister, and the",106

NA,Energy Security,106
Ms FLINT ,Boothby) (15:05): My constituency question is to the Minister for,106
NA,Environment and Energy. Can the minister update the House on what the government is doing,106
NA,to provide a more reliable and affordable electricity supply for the constituents and businesses,106
NA,in my electorate of Boothby and across South Australia. Is the minister aware of any,106
NA,alternative approaches?,106
Mr FRYDENBERG ,Kooyong-Minister for the Environment and Energy) (15:06): I,106
NA,thank the member for Boothby for her question and acknowledge her deep concern for the,106
NA,NA,106
NA,"very high electricity prices her constituents pay, which are the highest in the National",107
NA,Electricity Market and some 50 per cent higher than the wholesale electricity prices that they,107
NA,"pay over the border in Victoria. This makes life tough for Lucas Earthmovers, a family owned",107
NA,business that I visited in the electorate of Boothby. It also makes life tough for the households,107
NA,in Mitcham and Brighton and the small businesses in Dover Gardens and Somerton Park.,107
NA,We know that Premier Weatherill was conducting a big experiment-in his own words-,107
NA,"by the high uptake of intermittent power, namely solar and wind. But that big experiment",107
NA,failed when 1.7 million South Australians went into the black after the blackout in that state.,107
NA,Just yesterday we found out from the Australian Energy Regulator that there were some,107
NA,"10,000 electricity disconnections in South Australia over the last year. Of all the states and",107
NA,"territories monitored by the AER, this was the highest number, and the amount owed by those",107
NA,hardship customers in South Australia was the highest of any state or territory monitored by,107
NA,the AER. That is why the coalition is determined to improve energy security and energy,107
NA,affordability. We are doing that by pushing reforms into the gas market through the COAG,107
NA,"Energy Council, by commissioning the Finkel review into energy security, by looking into the",107
NA,"effectiveness of the limited merits review process and by trying to get a coordinated,",107
NA,harmonised approach across the states and the federal government when it comes to the,107
NA,renewable energy target.,107
NA,"But we are getting no help from those opposite, because they persist with their 50 per",107
NA,"cent-unrealistic and job-destroying-renewable energy target; they persist with a carbon tax,",107
NA,which we heard from the member for Hunter is a tax; and they persist in trading away blue-,107
NA,"collar jobs in the regions, in the coal-fired power stations, in order to win Green votes in the",107
NA,city. We know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to take Jay Weatherill's experiment,107
NA,and take it national. Shame on him. But you have to understand: it is not just business and the,107
NA,coalition who have a problem with Labor's approach; it is also members of the party,107
NA,represented by those opposite. Graham Richardson has described the Labor Party's policy as,107
NA,"stupid, as a farce and as a sell-out of the poor and the pensioners. They are not my words;",107
NA,they are Graham Richardson's. Only the coalition can deliver energy security and energy,107
NA,affordability for all Australians.,107
NA,Murray-Darling Basin,107
Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (15:09): My question is to the,107
NA,Prime Minister. I refer to the Deputy Prime Minister's letter of 17 November to the South,107
NA,"Australian government, indicating that the government would abandon its obligation to",107
NA,deliver 450 gigalitres of water to the Murray-Darling Basin through efficiency measures.,107
NA,Does the Deputy Prime Minister's letter reflect government policy?,107
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (15:09): Could the Leader of the,107
NA,Opposition assist us by showing where in that letter the word 'abandoned' is used?,107
NA,A government member: Not once!,107
Mr TURNBULL, Not once. Yet again the Leader of the Opposition is misrepresenting,107
NA,what ministers have said. He has no regard for the truth. He gave a long speech today in,107
NA,which he thoroughly misrepresented statements by the Minister for Immigration and Border,107
NA,"Protection-dishonestly did so. And I might say, on the subject of the recklessness of the",107
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, he quoted the member for Cowan, who said, 'I am fearful that the",107
NA,NA,107
NA,minister's comments will be used by an extreme few who would seek to harm the fabric of our,108
NA,society.',108

The SPEAKER, The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Members on both sides will,108
NA,cease interjecting. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order?,108

NA,Mr Joyce interjecting-,108
NA,Ms Henderson: Mr SPEAKER -,108
The SPEAKER, The Leader of the House and the Deputy Prime Minister will cease,108
NA,interjecting. The member for Corangamite will resume her seat. The Prime Minister has the,108
NA,call.,108
Mr TURNBULL," The Deputy Prime Minister, the government, is committed to the",108
NA,"policy, which is to implement the Basin Plan, but the Basin Plan has conditions and",108
NA,qualifications and was set in place by the member for Watson when he was the minister. I,108
NA,"have just read a portion of it, and achieving those neutral or improved social or economic",108
NA,"outcomes is challenging. We recognise that, and that is why we need all jurisdictions to work",108
NA,together in a constructive way to achieve it. But what we have seen today is this consistent,108
NA,dishonest misrepresentation by the Leader of the Opposition. If it is not the Deputy Prime,108
NA,"Minister, it is the immigration minister-he is misrepresenting one minister after another, all",108
NA,"reckless to the consequences of what he says, promoting anxiety, stirring up resentment,",108
NA,stirring up conflict. He has no regard for the consequences of what he does other than his own,108
NA,political interest.,108
Mr Shorten," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the letter from Barnaby Joyce, because I do",108
NA,not think the Prime Minister has seen it.,108

The SPEAKER, The foreign affairs minister will cease interjecting. I say to the member,108

NA,Victoria: Infrastructure,109
Ms HENDERSON ,Corangamite) (15:13): My constituency question is to the Minister,109
NA,for Infrastructure and Transport. Could the minister update the House on the government's,109
NA,"$1.5 billion Victorian infrastructure package, including $25 million for one of Australia's",109
NA,"most important tourist attractions, the iconic, the majestic, the awe-inspiring Great Ocean",109
NA,Road?,109
Mr CHESTER ,Gippsland-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:13): I thank,109
NA,the member for Corangamite for her question. I am not surprised to hear those opposite,109
NA,"cheering the member for Corangamite. She is a very popular local member, and I note her",109
NA,commitment to securing funding for that iconic touring route the Great Ocean Road.,109
NA,The Turnbull-Joyce government is focused on delivering a $50 billion infrastructure,109
NA,"investment program right across Australia-in our cities, in our major regional centres, in our",109
NA,rural and remote communities. We do that because we recognise that investing in good,109
NA,infrastructure not only can change people's lives but it can save people's lives. Too many,109
NA,"people are dying and too many people are being seriously injured on our roads. Tragically, as",109
NA,of today 257 people have died on Victorian roads this year. The total last year was 226. Every,109
NA,"death, obviously, is one too many, and that is why we are investing in safer roads right across",109
NA,"Australia, in projects like the Great Ocean Road.",109
NA,I was pleased to be with the Prime Minister last week in Melbourne when we announced a,109
NA,"$1.5 billion Victorian infrastructure package, and part of that package was $25 million for the",109
NA,"Great Ocean Road through our $345 million regional roads package, which will see projects",109
NA,completed right across Victoria. The projects in the member for Corangamite's own seat,109
NA,involve safety measures around the recent landslips and rock-falls which have-,109
NA,Mr Hill interjecting-,109
The SPEAKER, The member for Bruce is warned.,109
Mr CHESTER, impacted severely on this most scenic of all coastal routes. The member,109
NA,for Corangamite has been very active in calling for the Victorian government to match that,109
NA,"$25 million, and I am very confident that the Victorian government will come on board and",109
NA,yield to her campaign and support us in that regard. I commend the member for Corangamite,109
NA,for her advocacy.,109
NA,"I heard the member for Wannon cheering as well, and I want to recognise the work that is",109
NA,going to occur in his electorate on the Princes Highway upgrades. There is work also along,109
NA,the Hamilton Highway and the Geelong Ring Road. There is planning for the duplication of,109
NA,the Midland Highway between Geelong and Bannockburn.,109
NA,"In fact, there are projects right across Victoria which are going to be made possible through",109
NA,the Prime Minister's announcement last week. We are getting on with the job of delivering the,109
NA,"infrastructure that Victoria needs. This government, under the Victorian $1.5 billion",109
NA,"infrastructure package, is also delivering $220 million for the Murray basin freight rail",109
NA,NA,109
NA,project. The member for Mallee has been a very strong advocate for that project. There is,110
NA,"$500 million to go towards the Monash Freeway upgrade, bringing a total of a billion dollars",110
NA,"to go on reducing congestion on that route. The members for La Trobe, Deakin, Aston and",110
NA,Chisholm have all been strong advocates for improvements to that congested route. There is,110
NA,"$350 million for the upgrade of the M80 Ring Road. And, as I mentioned, there is $345",110
NA,million for rural and regional roads. One of the signature projects will be the $97 million for,110
NA,"the Echuca-Moama bridge, for which the new member for Murray has been a very strong",110
NA,advocate.,110
NA,So this is a good deal. It is a good deal for Victorians and it is a good deal for the Victorian,110
NA,government. I am sure they will come on board and match that $1.5 billion. (Time expired),110

Mr SHORTEN ,Maribyrnong-Leader of the Opposition) (15:16): My question is to the,110
NA,Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister have any advance notice of the contents of his,110
NA,deputy's letter of 17 November?,110
Mr TURNBULL ,Wentworth-Prime Minister) (15:16): The Deputy Prime Minister,110
NA,"understands the Basin Plan very well, as do I-as, indeed, does the member for Watson-and",110
NA,he understands that the government is committed to fulfilling it and he understands the,110
NA,provisions of the basin plan and the need for jurisdictions to work together to ensure it is,110
NA,delivered. And the commitment of our government to the basin plan is absolute. But it is a,110
NA,"plan which presents significant challenges, which the member for Watson understood back in",110
NA,2012 when he had the northern basin aspects of the plan reviewed to look at precisely these,110
NA,issues of ensuring that there is neutral or improved socioeconomic outcomes.,110

NA,That this House:,115
NA,"(1) notes that in 2012, following a comprehensive and rigorous process, the then Labor Government",115
NA,"declared 40 marine parks in Commonwealth waters, creating the world's first and largest comprehensive",115
NA,national network of marine parks;,115
NA,"(2) notes with concern that there is increasing pressure on Australia's marine environment, as indicated",115
NA,"by frequent and severe bleaching of coral reefs across Australia's northern waters, extensive and",115
NA,"unprecedented dieback of mangroves, and the loss of large areas of kelp forests in southern Australian",115
NA,waters;,115
NA,(3) notes that Australia's marine environment is the most biologically diverse in the world according to,115
NA,"the 2010 Census of Marine Life, with our oceans spanning tropical, temperate and sub-Antarctic waters,",115
NA,"and where at least 33,000 marine species have been identified (many of which are found nowhere else",115
NA,on earth);,115
NA,(4) notes that Australia is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and as,115
NA,such is required to both conserve as well as sustainably utilise its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ);,115
NA,(5) notes the economic opportunity that marine parks bring regional communities as evidenced by long,115
NA,"standing marine parks in Australia, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park which is worth over",115
NA,"$6 billion to the Queensland economy, and others including Ningaloo Marine Park, the Great Australian",115
NA,"Bight, Lord Howe Island, Solitary Islands Marine Park and Maria Island National Park;",115
NA,(6) notes the clear evidence that marine parks play an important economic role in accelerating the,115
NA,"recovery of depleted fisheries, and that the long term net effect on fisheries of increased resilience and",115
NA,sustainability from highly protected marine reserves is positive;,115
NA,(7) notes that in the 1990s the then Coalition Government put in place a systematic approach for,115
NA,"declaring a comprehensive, adequate, and representative network of marine parks in Australia's EEZ,",115
NA,and proceeded to declare 22 marine parks in Commonwealth waters;,115
NA,(8) notes with concern that:,115
NA,(a) in December 2013 the incoming Coalition Government suspended Labor's marine parks from,115
NA,operation by re-declaring the parks in order to set aside their management arrangements and,115
NA,"commencement date, pending the conduct of a politically motivated and unnecessary review; and",115
NA,NA,115
NA,"(b) after almost 3 years, these 40 marine parks have not been implemented, existing in statute only-",116
NA,leaving 5 of Australia's 6 marine regions with little to no protection at a time when the threats to,116
NA,Australia's valuable and important marine environment are increasing;,116
NA,(9) notes that in the May 2016 budget the Coalition Government committed to completing the re-,116
NA,development of the management plans for the new parks within 12 months;,116
NA,"(10) notes that in the recent consultation by Parks Australia, over 50,000 submissions were received",116
NA,"from around Australia, including from more than 5,000 recreational fishers, calling for the reinstatement",116
NA,"of the marine parks and their high level marine national park zoning, without further delay or loss of",116
NA,protection;,116
NA,(11) notes that the Expert Science Panel of the Coalition Government's own review recognises both the,116
NA,extensive science that went into the development of the marine parks developed by the Labor,116
NA,Government and the scientifically proven benefits of marine national parks;,116
NA,(12) notes the Bioregional Advisory Panel of the Coalition Government's own review recognised the,116
NA,extensive consultation that has occurred in developing the marine reserves developed by the Labor,116
NA,"Government, stating that there was in fact a considerable amount of 'consultation fatigue' expressed by",116
NA,many stakeholders;,116
NA,(13) notes the increasing move by other countries to put in place large and highly protected marine,116
NA,"parks in their EEZs, including action taken by the United States, Palau, Chile, New Zealand, the United",116
NA,"Kingdom, and, most recently, the declaration in October 2016 by 24 nations, including Australia, of the",116
NA,Ross Sea marine park in the Antarctic high seas; and,116
NA,(14) calls on the Coalition Government to bring the Commonwealth network of marine parks that were,116

NA,(a) the Strzelecki Track is a vital freight and tourist route connecting Adelaide to the Moomba Gas,119
NA,fields in South Australia's far north-east and South East Queensland;,119
NA,"(b) the route is used extensively by pastoralists, mining vehicles and tourists and is no longer fit for",119

NA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,121
NA,Domestic and Family Violence,121
NA,The SPEAKER (15:18): I have received a letter from the honourable member for Griffith,121
NA,proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for,121
NA,"discussion, namely:",121
NA,The need to address family violence as a national priority.,121
NA,I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their,121
NA,places.,121
NA,More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their,121
NA,places-,121
Ms BUTLER ,"Griffith) (15:19): It is, of course, a very important week to talk about",121
NA,"family violence-violence against women and their children. This Friday, 25 November, is",121
NA,the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It is also the,121
NA,commencement of 16 days of activism against gender related violence that concludes on 10,121
NA,"December, which is International Human Rights Day, as members would know.",121
NA,"Family violence is a national priority, and it should be treated that way in this country. On",121
NA,"average, at least one woman is killed by a partner or former partner in Australia each week.",121
NA,One in three Australian women has experienced physical violence since the age of 15. One in,121
NA,five Australian women has experienced sexual violence. One in four Australian women has,121
NA,experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner. One in four Australian,121
NA,women has experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner. And women are at,121
NA,least three times more likely than men to experience violence from an intimate partner. These,121
NA,sets of statistics are repeated so often in this place-and they are repeated for a very good,121
NA,"reason, because family violence is a national epidemic and, as I said earlier, it should be a",121
NA,national priority.,121
NA,"As a nation, we do need to do better when it comes to family violence. I am really proud",121
NA,"that it was a Labor government that introduced and instigated a plan, under the great",121
NA,"leadership of then Minister Tanya Plibersek, who instigated the National Plan for the",121
NA,Reduction of Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022. This is an excellent,121
NA,"document that is currently under its third action plan, which was announced in October this",121
NA,year. Much more needs to be done when it comes to fulfilling the aspirations of that plan: for,121
NA,a country that does not suffer from this epidemic of domestic and family violence that we,121
NA,have seen here for such a long period of time.,121
NA,I wanted to make some observations about some policy challenges that arise in relation to,121
NA,"family violence. For example, it has been almost three years since the coalition government",121
NA,"announced its cuts to community legal centres, which directly provide front-line services to",121
NA,"domestic violence victims. From 1 July 2017, community legal centres or CLCs are facing a",121
NA,"30 per cent funding cliff, with almost $35 million in cuts. And that is a terrible shame, Mr",121
NA,"Deputy Speaker Coulton-welcome to the chair-because, obviously, access to legal services",121
NA,and the assistance that surrounds legal services is incredibly important for women who are,121
NA,"seeking domestic violence orders, and for women who are in the family law courts, who need",121
NA,assistance to manage the experience of going through the family law courts. Legal assistance,121
NA,is incredibly important.,121
NA,NA,121
NA,Another thing that is incredibly important for people who have left a violent relationship is,122
NA,housing. Domestic violence is a leading cause of homelessness in this country. It is incredibly,122
NA,important that the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness be renewed. I call on the,122
NA,government to confirm that it will renew the National Partnership Agreement on,122
NA,"Homelessness, which expires very soon, and therefore that it will give those services that",122
NA,"provide housing for homeless people, including homeless women who have left violent",122
NA,"situations, the certainty that they need to continue their programs and ensure that their",122
NA,workforce does not leave.,122
NA,"Speaking of the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, it has actually now",122
NA,been more than two years since the coalition government's cuts to that partnership agreement's,122
NA,capital expenditure component. There were two annual cuts of $44 million-so an $88,122
NA,"million cut-to capital expenditure on homelessness in this country, at a time when people",122
NA,across the country are crying out for more housing options for women and children who have,122
NA,been forced to leave home because they have been facing family violence at home.,122
NA,"We have also been talking in this parliament today about family law, and I mentioned it",122
NA,earlier. There is a really important reform that needs to happen in relation to family law. It has,122
NA,been more than two years since the Productivity Commission recommended that the,122
NA,government reform family law processes so that perpetrators of family violence could not,122
NA,personally cross-examine their victims. It has also been a little bit more than 12 months since,122
NA,Women's Legal Services Australia wrote to the Minister for Women and to the Attorney-,122
NA,General to ask them to implement cross-examination reform in this country. In February this,122
NA,"year in Senate estimates, the Attorney-General said that nothing would be done in that term of",122
NA,"parliament to give effect to this recommendation, but we found out in April that a roundtable",122
NA,had been held in relation to this issue back in March. It is now November and there has been,122
NA,no news from the government about this crucial cross-examination reform in that intervening,122
NA,period.,122
NA,We invited the government today in question time to get on board with our policy. Our,122
NA,policy would require judges at the first mention in a family law proceeding-by which time,122
NA,you will have seen on the papers the disclosure of any allegations of family violence-to,122
NA,"consider whether vulnerable witnesses can be protected using existing measures, like video-",122
NA,"conferencing, having witnesses behind screens or having a support person, but, then, if that",122
NA,"were not enough, to require a judge to consider whether they should refuse to allow an alleged",122
NA,"perpetrator to personally cross-examine the alleged victim. Of course, it is important that",122
NA,accusers be able to be cross-examined by the accused. We do not seek to prevent people from,122
NA,"cross-examining, but we say that it should be able to be done through a lawyer-through",122
NA,someone who is a professional; through someone who is bound by a code of ethics; through,122
NA,someone who is bound by professional responsibility obligations and under the scrutiny of,122
NA,legal profession regulators. That is what we say the court should be able to do.,122
NA,"The court should be able to order that someone who has been accused of abusing, of",122
NA,"assaulting, of committing crimes against the other party in the family law matter should not be",122
NA,allowed to revictimise and retraumatise that person through personally grilling them in a,122
NA,"courtroom, through using family law proceedings to personally grill them.",122
NA,NA,122
NA,NA,122
Ms BUTLER, I hear the member for Moreton agreeing with me. He has been such a,123
NA,strong advocate of this reform. He has been a key driver of this reform. Labor has a strong,123
NA,"policy. We will, if elected, implement this change to cross-examination, but it should not have",123
NA,to wait that long. We know it and the government know it. It is time for the government to,123
NA,move to commit to making the legal change and to commit to providing the additional legal,123
NA,aid funding that would be needed so that both parties could have a lawyer if that power were,123
NA,required. This is a crucial reform. It is not just the Productivity Commission or Women's,123
NA,"Legal Services Australia who say so; it is also Rosie Batty, the former Australian of the Year,",123
NA,who has been campaigning so hard on her campaign for safety first in family law. This is a,123
NA,crucial reform. We have already waited long enough. The government know that they need to,123
NA,"do this, and it is about time that they moved on it.",123
NA,It has been about a year and half since this government's cuts to Family Violence,123
NA,Prevention Legal Services-which are Aboriginal family violence prevention legal services-,123
NA,"were reversed, but the government has yet to provide any assurance to those services of any",123
NA,"ongoing funding beyond 2018. Some funding was recently announced in October, but it was",123
NA,only a year's funding for a handful of services and no services have as yet been funded,123
NA,beyond 2018. These are incredibly important services that serve women who are most at risk,123
NA,"of family violence. The Prime Minister himself has, I think, recited the statistics that, if you",123
NA,"are an Aboriginal woman or an Islander woman, you are 34 times more likely to be a victim",123
NA,of family violence than a non-Aboriginal or Islander women. It is also the case that you are,123
NA,something like 60 times more likely to suffer a head injury.,123
NA,"These statistics are chilling for us, and they are a reason that certainty should be given to",123
NA,"these frontline, key services that do incredible work on the smell of an oily rag. If you are out",123
NA,"west, if you are in Roma, the Family Violence Prevention Legal Service covers hundreds of",123
NA,square kilometres with only a handful of staff. These are not expensive services but they are,123
NA,"critical services for Aboriginal women and Islander women, and there should be a stronger",123
NA,commitment from this government to continue to funding them.,123
NA,"In question time today the Minister for Social Services had a go at me-believe it or not,",123
NA,"on White Ribbon Day acknowledgment, of all days-for complaining about the fact that he",123
NA,"has taken the $5 million that they had committed to 1800RESPECT and, instead of giving it",123
NA,to Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia to hire more professional specialist trauma,123
NA,"counsellors, has given it to MHS, the private firm that was linked to the data breach involving",123
NA,"defence force personnel a couple of years ago, and has said to MHS, 'Take this money and",123
NA,create a triaging service to divert people away from the more professional specialised,123
NA,counsellors.' They advertised for counsellors-the people to take the phone calls-and the,123
NA,qualifications were lesser. The advertising required people to be able to commit to working,123
NA,from home. I would like to know whether the minister is proud of the fact that fewer people,123
NA,are actually making a call directly to a specialist qualified trauma counsellor in relation to,123
NA,"family violence when they are traumatised. If I were him, I would not be proud of that fact. I",123
NA,would also like the minister to confirm and to commit that all of the people answering those,123
NA,telephone calls are women. So far I have seen very little from anyone to confirm that that is,123
NA,the case.,123
NA,There is so much more to do. We need to work hard on this. I think that it would be,123
NA,wonderful if we had genuine bipartisanship on pursuing these reforms. (Time expired),123
NA,NA,123
Mr TUDGE ,Aston-Minister for Human Services) (15:29): I am pleased to rise in,124
NA,"support of the member for Griffith's matter of public importance motion today, which is the",124
NA,need to address family violence as a national priority. I admire the member for Griffith's,124
NA,commitments to this area. The reason why I get up in support of her motion is because it is,124
NA,"indeed already a national priority, and it was this government which put it on the national",124
NA,agenda predominantly when Prime Minister Turnbull came to office as Prime Minister.,124
NA,"Indeed, the very first cabinet decision of the Turnbull government was the $100 million",124
NA,"Women's Safety Package. I will go through that package in a few moments time, but, before",124
NA,"doing so, can I say that as all of us across all sides of this chamber would agree, violence",124
NA,against women and children is completely unacceptable in any form.,124
NA,"As a husband, as a father of two daughters and as the son of a mother, it is almost",124
NA,unfathomable for me to think that there are men out there who would physically harm the,124
NA,girls and women in their lives. It is unfathomable for so many of us. But when you look at the,124
NA,"data, unfortunately, it occurs way too frequently. The member for Griffith talked about some",124
NA,"of that data for domestic violence. I will just reiterate some of those figures, which are truly",124
NA,staggering. This is from the Domestic Violence Prevention Centre website. They have some,124
NA,data which shows: just under half a million Australian women reported that they had,124
NA,experienced physical or sexual violence or sexual assault in the past 12 months; more than a,124
NA,million women had experienced physical or sexual assault by their male current or ex-partner,124
NA,since the age of 15; over a third of women who experienced physical assault in the 12 months,124
NA,before the survey said the perpetrator was a current or previous male partner; a third said the,124
NA,perpetrator was a male family member or friend; a third of women had experienced physical,124
NA,violence since the age of 15; and one in five women had experienced sexual violence since,124
NA,the age of 15.,124
NA,"And, of course, we know that so many physical assaults, sexual assaults and family",124
NA,violence episodes are not reported at all to the police but they are truly staggering figures. But,124
NA,"behind every single one of those pieces of data is a person, is a child in many cases or is a",124
NA,family that may have been devastated because of the violence which had been committed,124
NA,against that woman or against that girl. It is truly a tragic situation when we still have,124
NA,"statistics like that and, of course, in the Indigenous community the figures are just so much",124
NA,"higher again. If time permits, I will reflect on that towards the end of my remarks.",124
NA,"Governments, and particularly the national government, should be leading in this area and",124
NA,should be leading to address some of the statistics and some of the domestic violence which is,124
NA,occurring at way too high a rate. This government has been the most proactive federal,124
NA,government that has ever been in this place in addressing domestic violence. I mentioned at,124
NA,the outset that the very first decision of the Turnbull cabinet was a $100 million Women's,124
NA,Safety Package.,124
NA,Ms Burney interjecting-,124
Mr TUDGE," When you look at some of the issues that funding package went towards, it",124
NA,"went towards very practical measures which are now being implemented, for example: $12",124
NA,million to trial with states the use of innovative technology to keep women safe; $5 million,124
NA,"for safer technology, including working with telecommunications companies to distribute safe",124
NA,phones to women and with the eSafety Commissioner to develop a resource package about,124
NA,online safety for women; $17 million to keep women safe in their homes by expanding,124
NA,NA,124
NA,successful initiatives like the Safer in the Home program to install CCTV cameras and other,125
NA,"safety equipment; $5 million to expand the 1800RESPECT number, which the Minister for",125
NA,Social Services referred to in question time; and a $2 million increase in funding for,125
NA,MensLine for tools and resources to support perpetrators not to reoffend.,125
NA,"I could go on, but all the details of the $100 million package that was announced are now",125
NA,public.,125
NA,"As the Prime Minister himself said a few weeks ago, that package is now having real,",125
NA,tangible results on the ground. He referred to a couple of things in his remarks when he was,125
NA,"with the Queensland Premier at the COAG summit. He referred, for example, to the fact that",125
NA,there are now 12 new specialist domestic violence units and five health justice partnerships,125
NA,which are now operational as a result of that funding. Those services are being delivered by,125
NA,community legal centres and legal aid commissions at locations across Australia. Since,125
NA,"January of this year, 1,400 services have been provided to 535 women experiencing family",125
NA,violence-82 per cent of whom have one or more children-and it provides a very integrated,125
NA,case-management approach. The 1800RESPECT line has also had a significant take-up since,125
NA,"the announcement. Since the additional funding has been introduced, over 80 per cent of calls",125
NA,"are answered within 20 seconds, which is a very significant improvement. That has been a",125
NA,very good initiative which came out of that package.,125
NA,That package was informed very much by Rosie Batty and Ken Lay and the work they did,125
NA,to support that package being developed. I am a bit disappointed about some of the snide,125
NA,"remarks coming across from the other side. Of all the issues that we deal with, surely this is",125
NA,one which should be above politics.,125
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,125
Mr TUDGE," Just in recent times, we announced a further $100 million package, which is",125
NA,"the Third Action Plan 2016-19, and that has a number of initiatives as well including: $20",125
NA,million allocated to prevention and early-intervention programs to break the cycle of domestic,125
NA,"and family violence; and $15 million to improve and expand national, domestic and family-",125
NA,"violence services, which includes the 1800RESPECT number and other initiatives. There has",125
NA,been a record amount of funding being put into domestic violence services from this,125
NA,government. It has also had the imprimatur of the Prime Minister-firstly of Tony Abbott and,125
NA,"now of Malcolm Turnbull, who has made this a national issue.",125
NA,Honourable members interjecting-,125
Mr TUDGE, I want to just briefly address perhaps the most important issue-,125
The DEPUTY SPEAKER , Mr Coulton): Order! The minister just might resume his,125
NA,"seat. I have had a request that, due to the serious nature of this MPI, we have some respect in",125
NA,"the House, and I think that goes for both sides. I will have no more interjections or I will be",125
NA,evicting people.,125
Mr TUDGE," Above and beyond the services that we are funding, though, perhaps the",125
NA,"most important part in really addressing domestic violence is changing attitudes, particularly",125
NA,changing attitudes amongst men. This is a task which all men should be facing up to and,125
NA,"reconsidering, but it is also a task on which the government can, in part, inform and lead. One",125
NA,of the things that we have done is allocate $30 million to a national campaign called 'Let's,125
NA,"stop it at the start'. We are six months into this three-year campaign, and it is already having",125
NA,NA,125
NA,"some quite considerable results, which we are very pleased to see. For example, between",126
NA,"April and June this year, the ad, which was put on YouTube, was the most watched",126
NA,"advertisement on YouTube, with more than 36 million views. It has already influenced 67 per",126
NA,"cent of all those who have seen these campaigns, and almost two-thirds of people have said",126
NA,they have taken action as a result of these campaigns.,126
NA,"We can take action there, but we also need to take action in the local football clubs and in",126
NA,"local communities, where all men can step up and say no in relation to disrespecting women",126
NA,"because, ultimately, as the Prime Minister frequently says, violence often starts from",126
NA,disrespecting women in the first place. This campaign is about respecting women. All of us,126
NA,"can make a difference, particularly the men in our society. We have a serious package, we are",126
NA,"doing serious things in relation to this, but we need further work. I commend this motion.",126
Ms HUSAR ,Lindsay) (15:39): Community leaders especially speak as advocates about,126
NA,"domestic violence, but they rarely speak as victims. I would like to do something a little",126
NA,"different today. In my first speech in this place, I said 29 out of my 36 years of life had been",126
NA,"affected by domestic violence. I am a survivor of family violence, and it has taken me a long",126
NA,time to overcome the trauma of that and be where I am today. I know there are a lot of women,126
NA,"out there, many of whom suffer in silence, and today I stand in solidarity with survivors and",126
NA,"with those women who are afraid to speak. I will use my story, told in this place, to advocate",126
NA,"for the change we need. I will use the prelude to White Ribbon Day, which is on this Friday,",126
NA,as an opportunity to shine a light into the darkest corner of my own life.,126
NA,The first 13 years of my life were marred by physical domestic violence committed,126
NA,towards my mother at the hands of my always-drunk-when-abusive father. My dad was the,126
NA,son of a World War II German soldier who committed many acts of violence against his own,126
NA,wife and against his seven children. My father had been raised in a home where violence was,126
NA,the accepted norm at a time when society said these things were private matters. Whilst the,126
NA,"blows that landed on my mother during my childhood did not land on me physically, they",126
NA,might as well have. The trauma inflicted was the same. I recall it vividly-and in great detail.,126
NA,"Each episode of this violence over my first 13 years was different, but the aftermath was",126
NA,"always the same: dad would apologise and promise to be different, and that would work for",126
NA,just a short time.,126
NA,"On the evening of another round of abuse, Dad launched the family dinner of that night at",126
NA,"the wall. The stain remained on that wall for a very long time, but the stain in my heart would",126
NA,linger much longer. Mum then bundled my sister and me into the family car and we fled. We,126
NA,"would go to the refuges in our community until, after so many years and so many incidents,",126
NA,my father knew the locations and we were not safe there anymore. We then shifted to staying,126
NA,"in hotels, which were located above pubs, where the people below were loud, and sometimes",126
NA,"their noise would spill into the streets, waking me and reminding me that I was not in my own",126
NA,bed or in my own home. I was in a foreign place because I was not safe in my home.,126
NA,"One night, when Mum was hurrying to get my sister and me out, dad had removed and",126
NA,"smashed the distributor cap from the car, rendering it useless and leaving us trapped. The",126
NA,police fetched us that time. I still remember sitting in the Penrith police station well into the,126
NA,early hours of the morning and the police officers giving us pink milk while we waited. The,126
NA,"police did their best. Again, after this event, my mum returned home.",126
NA,NA,126
NA,"We know many, many women return time and time again, even when their lives are",127
NA,"massively disrupted, along with those of their children, and I hope that the blame that was",127
NA,launched at my Mum during the nineties for not leaving is no longer part of the 'solution',127
NA,around domestic violence and that the question of 'why doesn't she just leave' quits being,127
NA,"asked. Eventually, though, the courage rises up, services step up and women stand up, finally",127
NA,leaving-but not before one last terrible incident. There were 13 police cars the last time,127
NA,physical violence affected my childhood. But this was the end of the physical violence once,127
NA,"and for all. Whilst the physical part ceased, other abuse around finance and control ramped",127
NA,"right up. Sadly, the wheel of domestic violence continues to affect my life as a grown woman",127
NA,with children of my own. The last 16 years of my life have been and continue to be affected,127
NA,by domestic and family violence.,127
NA,"In the limited time I have left, I would like to take this opportunity to thank opposition",127
NA,"leader Bill Shorten for his continued support of my personal situation, his understanding and",127
NA,the support he provides to me. I would like to thank my caucus colleagues and our staff who,127
NA,know my story yet do not judge me and continue to provide support. I would like to,127
NA,"acknowledge the Penrith Women's Health Centre, who have been providing services to my",127
NA,"community for 30 years, including to my mum then and to my own family now.",127
NA,In my experience I have found that victims mostly do not talk about domestic violence,127
NA,because other people do not talk about domestic violence. For many years I was embarrassed,127
NA,and I was ashamed. I know that I should not have been but I was. I hope that today I have lent,127
NA,"my voice, my story and my passion for advocating for change to the choir of the white ribbon",127
NA,"movement to stand up, to speak out and to act. Thank you.",127
NA,"Mr LLEW O'BRIEN (Wide Bay) (15:45): Before I go on, I would like to acknowledge",127
NA,the very difficult speech just given by the member for Lindsay. It is certainly a display of how,127
NA,"domestic violence affects the people who are involved in it, and those around them.",127
NA,"This is a very serious matter and, yes, there is a need to address family violence as a",127
NA,"national priority, absolutely. We need to have a coordinated approach to address it, we need",127
NA,the appropriate responses to acts of domestic violence and we need the appropriate education,127
NA,"to prevent domestic violence. We need to have, as a society, a better understanding of",127
NA,"domestic violence. If we are going to tackle this issue at a community and social level, we all",127
NA,"need to understand what domestic violence is. With domestic violence, what first comes to",127
NA,"mind is a very violent attack by a man on his partner in the family. That is a tragedy, and it is",127
NA,what we need to identify as the most significant and important area of domestic violence that,127
NA,we need to address. But we also need to understand that domestic violence has a number of,127
NA,"different levels and, as the Prime Minister said earlier, that domestic violence always starts",127
NA,with disrespect.,127
NA,"Domestic violence also shows its ugly head in control, when the abuser starts to control the",127
NA,victim through any number of different methods-whether it is controlling their social,127
NA,"environment, who they are allowed to see or the clothes they are allowed to wear. It really is a",127
NA,"terrible, terrible situation to be in, and it spans all cultures and sociodemographic areas-",127
NA,"unfortunately, it is particularly prevalent in Indigenous communities. The problem focuses on",127
NA,"women, and it should be, because women are predominantly the victims. But an area that I",127
NA,"probably recognise, in some ways, more than most is that women can also be offenders when",127
NA,"it comes to family violence, and men can be victims.",127
NA,NA,127
NA,"When I first became a police officer, there was a change to the law that added same-sex",128
NA,couples to the area of family violence. I think we always need to recognise that the family has,128
NA,"changed over many years, and that a victim of family violence in a same-sex couple suffers in",128
NA,"the same way as a victim in a hetrosexual relationship. We need to respond, and we always",128
NA,"need to recognise that. It is something that I have seen over and over again, and it is an area of",128
NA,the community that is often forgotten.,128
NA,"When it comes to education, as parents we need to let our sons know that only cowards",128
NA,"beat women. Only cowards commit those acts that destroy families. And, as a father, I want",128
NA,my daughter to know that she does not have to put up with it. As the member for Lindsay said,128
NA,"before, quite often women go back, and it is such a complex area. It is so devastating when",128
NA,people look at women who continue to return to violent relationships and they just do not,128
NA,understand the control that their abuser has over them. We need to educate our daughters that,128
NA,they should never put up with being the victim of abuse.,128
NA,The coalition is acting with regard to family violence. We have implemented quite a,128
NA,"number of plans, including the action plan that sets out 36 practical actions under six priority",128
NA,"areas. We are doing the work on family violence. Family violence is something that, as a",128
NA,"society, we should never put up with. It is one of the motivating factors that sees me here as a",128
NA,"member of parliament, and I am proud to be part of a government that is addressing this issue.",128
Mr GOSLING ,Solomon) (15:50): I stand to speak about family violence and White,128
NA,"Ribbon Day, which is marked this Friday, as is the International Day for Elimination of",128
NA,"Violence against Women. I want to acknowledge my friend, the member for Lindsay, and all",128
NA,of the speakers. I was proud to attend the White Ribbon breakfast here in Parliament House,128
NA,this morning. I want to acknowledge all of those whose lives have been affected by the,128
NA,scourge of family violence and I want to acknowledge all of those who are working to make,128
NA,things better.,128
NA,"I will touch on the Northern Territory's situation and, hopefully, will give some good",128
NA,examples. I am proud to be a member of a party that is proposing concrete practical steps to,128
NA,address family violence in our communities. While I am not taking anything away from what,128
NA,"the Prime Minister had to say this morning, I am proud of the initiatives that our leader has",128
NA,"highlighted, including the issue of family violence leave, the initiatives around revenge porn",128
NA,and also how we can change how our courts run so that victims of family violence are not,128
NA,then taken through another process of unnecessary trauma.,128
NA,One of the reasons that I welcome our leader's approach is because of the impact of family,128
NA,violence on the people of Darwin and Palmerston-my electorate. The overall effect of family,128
NA,violence in the Northern Territory is substantial.,128
NA,"For example, we have by far the highest rate of homicide offences related to family",128
NA,"violence in the country. In the last three years, there have been 75,000 incidents of family",128
NA,"violence in the Northern Territory-out of a population of 244,000. At least one child is",128
NA,subjected to family violence in the NT every day; 44 per cent of family violence orders were,128
NA,"breached, and 44 per cent of family violence offenders were repeat offenders. Rates of",128
NA,assaults related to family violence were more than four times higher in the NT than in any,128
NA,"other Australian state or territory. These are obviously not stats to be proud of, and we are",128
NA,certainly not proud of them in the Northern Territory. But we look at them in the cold light of,128
NA,day and commit ourselves to making things better. There is a long way to go.,128
NA,NA,128
NA,One thing that we are very proud of is that there are volunteers working both in the,129
NA,"protection space and in the legal space-with the refuges. But there are also people, strong",129
NA,"men, working with other men in men's groups to encourage them to be the agents for change",129
NA,"in their communities. One such organisation is the 'No More' campaign, which is headed by",129
NA,"local Aboriginal leader, Charlie King. He is an inspirational man. He is widely known for his",129
NA,"role as an ABC sports broadcaster, but he has also tirelessly dedicated himself to this No",129
NA,More campaign.,129
NA,The campaign started in 2006. It followed a large meeting of Indigenous men from right,129
NA,"across the Northern Territory. I stress that, obviously, family violence is not just an issue to",129
NA,do with Indigenous men-but Charlie King has seen the need and called together people from,129
NA,37 different locations throughout the Northern Territory. They came together and made a,129
NA,commitment that they were going to work to make sure that there was no more family,129
NA,"violence. They have been working on that for some time, and I am very proud to say that",129
NA,Charlie King will be coming here to Canberra next week and will be bringing some,129
NA,"countrymen with him, and they will be talking about the initiatives that they have committed",129
NA,to.,129
NA,"When we address family violence on a national scale, it is important that we support",129
NA,groups that are tackling family violence on the local level. We need to make sure that,129
NA,organisations that are working with people caught up in family violence are properly funded. I,129
NA,want to acknowledge all of those people who work in the refuges and the legal services of the,129
NA,Northern Territory. Keep doing your work. It is absolutely essential. And I want to say well,129
NA,done to Charlie King and I look forward to seeing him here next week.,129
Ms LANDRY ,Capricornia-Deputy Nationals Whip) (15:55): I thank the member for,129
NA,raising the issue of domestic violence. I agree with the sentiments that family violence should,129
NA,"be a national priority-and indeed it is. As I have said before, there are few places in",129
NA,Queensland that witness higher rates of domestic violence than my electorate of Capricornia.,129
NA,The Capricornia police district reports the highest rate of domestic violence in Queensland.,129
NA,"While the statistics are marginally improving, according to Rockhampton police the rate of",129
NA,domestic violence attacks here is 141 per cent higher than the state average.,129
NA,"Last year, to assist families in trauma caught up in the cycle of domestic violence and other",129
NA,"Family Court matters, the Turnbull-Joyce government took a bold and positive step to appoint",129
NA,a permanent Federal Court Circuit judge to be based in Rockhampton. Judge Anne Demack,129
NA,"held her first sitting on 7 March, presided over by the Chief Judge of the Federal Circuit",129
NA,"Court, his Honour Judge John Pascoe.",129
NA,"I lobbied hard for the Commonwealth Attorney-General to make this appointment, in a city",129
NA,where family violence is out of control. This appointment was both supported and hailed by,129
NA,the Central Queensland Law Association as the most significant decision for the legal,129
NA,industry in Capricornia in over 40 years. It directly helps some of the most disadvantaged,129
NA,"families that are caught up in the cycle of domestic violence, and subsequent custody and",129
NA,family law disputes.,129
NA,"The new permanent Federal Court Circuit judge services all of Central Queensland,",129
NA,"including Rockhampton, Mackay, Gladstone and Emerald. But, to my surprise, this was",129
NA,"criticised by the state Labor government. Queensland's state Labor Attorney-General, Yvette",129
NA,"D'Ath, and the federal opposition's shadow Attorney-General, the member for Isaacs, both",129
NA,NA,129
NA,denigrated the appointment of a new federal judge in Rockhampton. They were more,130
NA,concerned about bricks and mortar than the safety and survival of victims and the improved,130
NA,and more timely access to a Family Court judge in a regional area with the worst record for,130
NA,family violence.,130
NA,An article dated 17 February this year in the Queensland Times reports:,130
NA,"Queensland Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath has accused her federal counterpart, Senator George",130
NA,"Brandis, of incorrectly referring to a Rockhampton courtroom as vacant and refusing to contact her",130
NA,"about courthouse arrangements for the judge, Anne Demack.",130
NA,………,130
NA,"""There is no vacant courtroom,"" she told Queensland Parliament …",130
NA,"That was a load of rubbish. In the same article, it was reported:",130
NA,Federal Circuit Court of Australia chief Richard Foster told the committee he wrote to the,130
NA,Queensland Justice Department's Deputy Director-General and to Ms D'Ath.,130
NA,"""I received a response on 7 January saying, 'services are limited but basically we do have some",130
NA,capacity; …,130
NA,"""Now that (Sen Brandis) has made the announcement … we can accommodate it.""",130
NA,"So there was room at the inn after all-albeit be it with renovations, which the",130
NA,Commonwealth was happy to pay for.,130
NA,"In February, the Brisbane Times reported Queensland's Attorney-General as saying Judge",130
NA,Demack's appointment was 'an empty gesture to serve a cynical political purpose'.,130
NA,"Well, today, on the topic that domestic violence needs to be a national priority, can the",130
NA,member of Isaacs please explain what on earth his state counterpart means and why he too,130
NA,objected to the appointment? The Liberal-National coalition is standing up for the most,130
NA,"vulnerable in our community, an area hit by the highest domestic violence rates in the state,",130
NA,while the Labor Party say appointing a permanent judge to Rockhampton is cynical. That is,130
NA,just rubbish. Do they want these families to travel to Brisbane and wait years for a chance to,130
NA,front a judge to arbitrate family disputes and violence? In the so-called Labor heartland that is,130
NA,"Rockhampton city, the Labor Party has failed the most vulnerable families at a time when",130
NA,they most need faster access to the Federal Court.,130
NA,The positive steps the government are taking include the recent announcement at the,130
NA,COAG summit that we would commit $100 million to Commonwealth initiatives under the,130
NA,"Third Action Plan, including $20 million for preventative strategies and cultural change; $15",130
NA,million for front-line services like housing and financial support; $10 million to prevent forms,130
NA,"of sexual violence, including nonconsensual sharing of intimate images; $25 million to",130
NA,address family violence in Indigenous communities; and $30 million for front-line family,130
NA,violence legal services.,130
Dr FREELANDER ,Macarthur) (16:00): I am pleased to rise to support the motion moved,130
NA,by the member for Griffith. For most of my career I have had mainly positive interaction with,130
NA,"families. However, there has always been some exposure to family violence. Having worked",130
NA,"on call at my local hospital with a busy paediatric and maternity unit, I have seen some bad",130
NA,things that have been etched in my memory.,130
NA,I remember two twins-one of whom died; the other survived with severe cerebral palsy-,130
NA,who at eight weeks of age had their skulls smashed so severely that when I resuscitated them,130
NA,NA,130
NA,it felt like their heads were the smashed shell of a boiled egg. I remember the child shaken,131
NA,"and bashed so severely at the age of three that she never saw, walked or talked again. I",131
NA,remember the two-year-old boy who was so severely punched that his liver was described as,131
NA,looking like red jelly at autopsy. I remember the six-year-old girl who was starved to death in,131
NA,her own home. I remember the mother made hemiplegic and unable to care for her children,131
NA,"following an attack by her partner. So these are real things, and they have been real things to",131
NA,me in my career.,131
NA,We know that there is a strong correlation with violence against children and violence,131
NA,against women. Some of the women I have seen with their children have been murdered by,131
NA,"their partners. I know that there is more that we could do. Firstly, let me say that I abhor the",131
NA,phrase 'domestic violence'. It implies a somewhat benign event. This is not a benign event.,131
NA,"Nothing could be further from the truth, as I have seen. Secondly, I do know that all of us in",131
NA,"this parliament abhor violence in families, and we are at one in wanting to deal with it.",131
NA,I think it is a great thing that men are taking responsibility for crimes that are,131
NA,"predominantly perpetrated by men. We must also educate our young people, especially those",131
NA,"exposed to family violence, about its causes and about prevention strategies. Most of all, we",131
NA,need to fund legal support and access to housing for those women and children fleeing violent,131
NA,households. Domestic violence is pernicious and it is evil. We have done a little better of late,131
NA,"with recognising the evil, even though for many that recognition has come too late.",131
NA,"Violence in the home is seen, properly, as a national problem, but it needs to be dealt with",131
NA,"at all levels of government. We do now have a national plan and a national approach which,",131
NA,"in the broad, has widespread support not just amongst law-makers but also in the community.",131
NA,"We should also have a national registry of perpetrators of family violence. For example, when",131
NA,the ACT government recently imposed-and in an election year-a flat rate of $30 per,131
NA,household for a Safer Families Levy to address the consequences of family violence there was,131
NA,barely a ripple of disapproval. And that is a good thing.,131
NA,But it is the pernicious side to violence and its pervasive effect on families and on children,131
NA,"that make it so hard to contemplate, to explain and to address. Good intentions are not",131
NA,enough. The job of governing extends beyond just passing laws and saying the right things at,131
NA,"the right time, or even appropriating the necessary funding. It involves ensuring that what we",131
NA,do actually works. Governments especially need to ensure that the left hand knows what the,131
NA,right hand is doing. And we need to be more open about our approach to family violence.,131
NA,Stripping community legal services of over a third of their funding makes no sense if you are,131
NA,genuine about addressing family violence and providing support and protection to those who,131
NA,most need it.,131
NA,One of the few free services that provide comprehensive assistance for women and families,131
NA,escaping family violence are Community Legal Centres. The Macarthur Legal Centre in my,131
NA,electorate includes a Women's Domestic Violence Court Advocacy Service. That centre and,131
NA,"those like it provide information, referrals, advocacy and support for women and children",131
NA,"when they most need it. They help with the housing department, Centrelink and police",131
NA,"referrals. That is as you would expect. Let's give the people doing the job, and who have been",131
NA,"doing it for many, many years, the appropriate resources and the help that they deserve and",131
NA,need. I have seen many good people try their best to make life better for those traumatised and,131
NA,trapped by the fear and the physical reality of violence in the home.,131
NA,NA,131
NA,We have finally realised that this is not an isolated or localised problem; it is more akin to a,132
NA,national emergency. There is impetus for meaningful change right across our country and,132
NA,across our parliament. (Time expired),132
NA,Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (16:05): I also welcome this opportunity to speak on this matter,132
NA,of public importance moved by the member for Griffith. If there ever was a matter of public,132
NA,"importance, this surely would be it. Domestic and family violence is about more the what is",132
NA,spoken about in this place and in these corridors; it is also about shifting the culture across our,132
NA,"nation. I want to commend all speakers in this very important debate, particularly the member",132
NA,for Lindsay. I thank the member for Lindsay for her courage in speaking out. I certainly hope,132
NA,"that that will encourage more people to also speak out and, in doing so, help us shift the",132
NA,culture across the nation.,132
NA,"As the Prime Minister said in his address to this morning's White Ribbon breakfast, what",132
NA,we are talking about today is a matter of respect.,132
NA,Disrespecting women does not always result in violence against women. But all violence against,132
NA,women begins with disrespecting women.,132
NA,"This is backed up by the national statistics, which are shocking. One in three women have",132
NA,been a victim of physical or sexual violence since the age of 15 by someone known to them.,132
NA,"One in four women have been emotionally abused by a partner, and one woman dies almost",132
NA,every week at the hand of a current or former partner.,132
NA,When I spoke earlier today with Brisbane Water Local Area Command Superintendent,132
NA,Danny Sullivan it became clear that these statistics are just as true in my electorate of,132
NA,"Robertson, where, on average, every two hours a police vehicle will respond to a domestic",132
NA,"violence call on the Central Coast-not every two weeks, not every two days, but every two",132
NA,hours. That is why I helped to facilitate a local domestic violence committee in my electorate,132
NA,with local community leaders and local experts meeting together to discuss grassroots,132
NA,"solutions and to also help start a conversation with more families, teachers, young people and",132
NA,"schools, in particular. Slowly, I believe that we can see a change in the conversation on the",132
NA,Central Coast and across our nation.,132
NA,"We can see this in one simple but breathtaking local visual statement, where Brisbane",132
NA,Water Local Area Command has overseen an extraordinary community push to plant white,132
NA,poppies on the grass at The Skillion at Terrigal this year. Similar to a sea of red poppies,132
NA,"earlier this year as we commemorated Anzac Day, these white poppies honour the thousands",132
NA,of victims of domestic and family violence. I am told that volunteers worked for hundreds of,132
NA,"hours to hand-make 55,000 poppies that were placed there on Monday in the shape of a",132
NA,"ribbon. Terrigal provides a stunning backdrop to the display, a display which was three years",132
NA,in the making. Our local police partnered with women's empowerment and advocacy group,132
NA,"Zonta to help make the display a reality, and I am advised that the Central Coast Council also",132
NA,"contributed $6,000 for the materials. We even had local businesses lending a helping hand,",132
NA,with Burson Auto Parts at Gosford donating screwdrivers at short notice after volunteers,132
NA,arrived to discover that the ground was too hard for the wooden poppy stems. School students,132
NA,"walking past have been dropping in to help out and the local newspaper, the Express",132
NA,"Advocate, has done an excellent job in promoting this initiative. I commend Superintendent",132
NA,"Sullivan and his team, including Gillian Mitchell, Tim Jeffrey, Jessica Bradbury, Nick Carroll",132
NA,"and Peter Watson. These are our local men and women on the front line, who do an",132
NA,NA,132
NA,outstanding job. I look forward to meeting them on Sunday and encourage our community to,133
NA,join us as we walk up the Terrigal Skillion to make a statement in condemning the actions of,133
NA,those who commit domestic violence.,133
NA,I also take this opportunity to commend the Turnbull government on its announcement,133
NA,"today of the new eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant. The commissioner will have a",133
NA,"strong focus on online safety and the issue of non-consensual sharing of intimate images,",133
NA,"often described as revenge porn. She has a big task ahead, but I am pleased to see that the",133
NA,Turnbull government will conduct a public consultation process on proposed civil penalties in,133
NA,"this area, targeted at both the perpetrators and those sites which host intimate images and",133
NA,videos shared without consent.,133
NA,"There is much more that this government is doing too, including a $30 million national",133
NA,"campaign called Stop it at the Start to change young people's attitudes to women and violence,",133
NA,"in partnership, of course, with our states and territories. We have also launched the third",133
NA,"action plan, with an additional $100 million investment. This complements the existing work",133
NA,"of states and territories around Australia, including in New South Wales, where video is now",133
NA,collected by police when attending a domestic violence incident which is then able to be,133
NA,submitted to court as evidence. I understand from Superintendent Danny Sullivan that our,133
NA,"local police command is leading the state in taking advantage of this initiative. Finally, we",133
NA,"have the $100 million Women's Safety Package, which includes expanding the",133
NA,"1800RESPECT frontline services, drastically reducing wait times. I commend the government",133
NA,on its strong leadership and approach to this most important of issues and encourage all of us,133
NA,here to continue to promote the need for leadership in standing up against domestic and,133
NA,family violence.,133
Ms STANLEY ,"Werriwa) (16:10): I rise to speak on this matter of public importance,",133
NA,acknowledging that this Friday we observe White Ribbon Day and the International Day for,133
NA,"the Elimination of Violence against Women. Moreover, I acknowledge the courage of the",133
NA,"member for Lindsay, who by telling her story today in this place vividly illustrates why we",133
NA,must eliminate all violence against women and children. The deepest scars from family,133
NA,violence are often invisible and stay with victims for life. It creates a deep and long-term,133
NA,"harm, not only to them but to those around them, that can engulf whole families, especially",133
NA,"the children. To feel that you are trapped, with no recourse, no way to act and nowhere to go,",133
NA,is suffocating and further isolating in itself. The statistics are stark and confronting too. While,133
NA,"one instance of family violence is one too many, to hear that one in four women has",133
NA,"experienced physical or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner is appalling, and",133
NA,yet it is known that many more incidents of domestic violence go unreported.,133
NA,"When something as harmful and damaging as this continues to be so common, it is",133
NA,incumbent on us in this place to act. I am proud to be part of a party that champions women,133
NA,"and the contribution that they make to our communities, our workplaces and our homes. I am",133
NA,also proud of the commitments that were announced by the member for Maribyrnong this,133
NA,"morning, commitments that go beyond simply acknowledging that the status quo is not good",133
NA,enough and instead propose strong practical actions that seek to improve the protection for,133
NA,victims and witnesses of family violence. The reforms that Labor has proposed would compel,133
NA,a judge to consider whether a vulnerable witness should be protected in cases where domestic,133
NA,"violence is alleged. This would mean that, where a judge believes the mechanisms available",133
NA,NA,133
NA,"to him or her under the Family Law Act are insufficient to protect such vulnerable witnesses,",134
NA,the judge will be empowered to direct that all unrepresented litigants in the matter be,134
NA,represented by legal aid. This means that vulnerable children and women will not have to,134
NA,suffer cross-examination by their perpetrators. Not only is this a practical reform advocated,134
NA,by many non-government organisations and the Productivity Commission's Access to justice,134
NA,report; it is most importantly a reform that will mean that victims are not further harmed.,134
NA,The cuts to frontline community legal services continue to be of great concern in my,134
NA,electorate. Reducing the funding of these services by 30 per cent means that fewer women can,134
NA,"access the legal support services they need when they are in crisis. On top of that, the",134
NA,uncertainty of the funding beyond 2017 for the national partnership agreement means that,134
NA,there will be fewer opportunities for those fleeing domestic violence to find somewhere to,134
NA,"stay. In fact, the New South Wales Liberal government's reduction in funding for those",134
NA,refuges has meant that there have been refuges closed which were operating for 30 years and,134
NA,"doing a fine job. We owe it to every family affected. We need to do more, we can do more to",134
NA,address this and we should just do it.,134
Mr ALEXANDER ,Bennelong) (16:13): I would like to thank the member for Griffith for,134
NA,raising this matter today. This is one of the most pressing issues facing Australia and I am,134
NA,"proud of this government's and, equally, Labor's records on the issue of domestic violence.",134
NA,This Friday is White Ribbon Day. We have already discussed this in the Federation Chamber,134
NA,earlier this week. I had the honour to speak on the topic and I would again like to thank the,134
NA,"member for Gellibrand for raising it, but it is so important that I have no issue repeating",134
NA,myself in this chamber.,134
NA,White Ribbon Day is a day to honour and recognise the suffering of victims of domestic,134
NA,violence and reaffirm our commitment to ending domestic violence in Australia. I am very,134
NA,proud to be a White Ribbon ambassador. On Monday I restated my oath: 'I pledge never to,134
NA,"commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women.' These simple words are a",134
NA,prescription for a safer life and a better society. This oath should stop violence in its tracks,134
NA,"but, sadly, as we know, words and intentions are not enough. That is why I am proud of the",134
NA,government's record on domestic violence.,134
NA,Domestic violence has been at the forefront of the coalition's agenda since we came to,134
NA,"office in 2013, and we have built momentum around the issue. The first act of the Turnbull",134
NA,"government was to announce a $100 million Women's Safety Package, which focused on",134
NA,"practical, immediate action to keep women and children safe as well as improving training for",134
NA,frontline workers. One massive success that is saving lives includes expansion of the,134
NA,1800RESPECT frontline service. Our new model for telephone counselling has reduced the,134
NA,average call wait time for victims of domestic violence from 10 minutes to just 35 seconds-,134
NA,and I agree with the member for Griffith: women should be manning these phones.,134
NA,"We also launched the evocative Stop it at the Start campaign, which dominated water",134
NA,"cooler conversations earlier this year. The ad has been viewed 36 million times, and 67 per",134
NA,"cent of all influences-parents, family members, teachers, coaches and employers-have seen",134
NA,"the campaign and, of those, 68 per cent have taken action. Essentially, almost half of all",134
NA,"influences have seen the campaign, absorbed its message and done something in response to",134
NA,"it, including reconsidering the way they behave towards others and talking with a young",134
NA,person about respect in relationships.,134
NA,NA,134
NA,"Just last month, the government co-hosted the COAG National Summit on Reducing",135
NA,"Violence against Women and their Children. The summit brought together first ministers,",135
NA,"women's safety ministers as well as academics and experts in domestic and family violence,",135
NA,and leaders in business and the not-for-profit sector to review progress and highlight best,135
NA,"practices in efforts to reduce violence. At the summit, COAG launched the Third Action Plan",135
NA,of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010 to 2022.,135
NA,"This includes a $100 million commitment for preventative strategies and cultural change, for",135
NA,"frontline services like housing and financial support, to prevent forms of sexual violence, to",135
NA,address family violence in Indigenous communities and $30 million for frontline family,135

Mr ROBERT ,"Fadden) (16:19): On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I",135
NA,"present the following reports: Report 164 Air Services-Kuwait, Air Services-Bahrain and",135
NA,Report 166 Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness-USA; Convention on Choice of,135
NA,Courts-accession; GATT Schedule of Concessions-amendment; Radio Regulations-partial,135
NA,revision.,135
NA,Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).,135
Mr ROBERT, by leave-I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties reports 164,135
NA,"and 166, which contain the committee's review of six treaty actions. Four had been tabled in",135
NA,the 44th Parliament. Then the inquiries lapsed when parliament was dissolved. These treaties,135
NA,were subsequently referred to the committee at the beginning of the 45th Parliament.,135
NA,NA,135
NA,There are also two air service agreements in Report 164. The first is with Kuwait and,136
NA,follows the standard Australian model air service agreement and is expected to facilitate,136
NA,further trade and tourism between our two countries. The second is a protocol to amend the,136
NA,current air service agreement with Bahrain and provide far more liberal route rights and tariff,136
NA,provisions for both countries. It also changes reference from the 'State of Bahrain' to the,136
NA,'Kingdom of Bahrain'. The committee has recommended that both air service agreements be,136
NA,ratified.,136
NA,"Turning to Report 166, the Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness with the United",136
NA,States of America will enable Australian manufacturers to gain access to the US aviation,136
NA,"market, which, as we know, is one of the largest in the world. It will certainly encourage",136
NA,"innovators to invest in new technologies and, especially, modification and modernisation of",136
NA,old aircraft.,136
NA,The Convention on Choice of Court Agreements sets out how courts will treat jurisdiction,136
NA,"clauses in private contracts. In these clauses, the contracting parties agree in which court",136
NA,system they will resolve any disputes. Australia's accession to the convention will provide,136
NA,"greater clarity and certainty in this area, especially for those seeking private agreements",136
NA,across borders.,136
NA,"Further, the amendments to Australia's Schedule of Concessions in the General Agreement",136
NA,"on Tariffs and Trade, which we all know as GATT, will remove tariffs on a range of",136
NA,technology products and eliminate agricultural export subsidies. The committee,136
NA,acknowledges the significance of these two ministerial decisions. We note that both will,136
NA,"provide incremental improvements for Australian consumers and farmers, which is not only",136
NA,"good for those on the land. However, further work always needs to be done to reduce",136
NA,"domestic subsidies and non-tariff barriers, if more progress is to be made on liberalising",136
NA,global trade.,136
NA,"Finally, the partial revision of the Radio Regulations updates the international use of the",136
NA,"radio frequency spectrum, including the allocation of spectrum to radio communication",136
NA,"services. These regulations ensure the rational, efficient and equitable use of this global",136
NA,resource called a spectrum. The revisions will improve a wide range of areas including:,136
NA,provisions for the growing demand for mobile broadband services; improving aeronautical,136
NA,communications capabilities; and provisions to improve radar for collision avoidance and,136
NA,driver-warning systems. Acceptance of the revisions will allow Australia to align itself with,136
NA,the rest of the world in its regulation of the radio-frequency spectrum.,136

NA,Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (16:23): It is a privilege to have the opportunity to,137
NA,continue my comments on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path:,137
NA,"Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. I actually was not going to speak on this bill but I heard the",137
NA,member for Lalor talk about the movie The Pursuit of Happyness. It is actually a true story,137
NA,based on an American gentleman named Chris Gardner. He was born in 1954 to an,137
NA,"underprivileged background. His childhood was racked with poverty, domestic violence,",137
NA,alcoholism and family illiteracy. In his late 20s he found himself in jail. Coming out of jail,137
NA,"with no experience, no college education, no degree and no connections, he took on an",137
NA,"internship, which is what this legislation is all about. He took on an internship at a",137
NA,"stockbroking firm to learn the ropes. He realised that with that background, without having an",137
NA,"education, he had to strive harder, work harder and work smarter. He had to use his time as",137
NA,"best he could. They say he was the first to arrive at work and the last to leave, even though he",137
NA,was unpaid on an internship.,137
NA,"Eventually, he got a job. He then went on to work for another broking firm and then took",137
NA,"the risk of breaking out on his own. With $10,000 in capital and the only piece of furniture",137
NA,"being a single desk, he started up his own broking firm, called Gardner Rich. The rest is",137
NA,history. He went on to have a net worth today of over $60 million. He made his first million,137
NA,"dollars by the age of 34 and, to celebrate, he bought himself a black Ferrari previously owned",137
NA,by Michael Jordan.,137
NA,"He owns a multimillion dollar apartment in Chicago's Trump Tower, and President-elect",137
NA,Trump has said of Chris Gardner that his story is a tremendous lesson in tenacity. He has also,137
NA,recently written a book titled Start Where You Are: Life Lessons in Getting from Where You,137
NA,"Are to Where You Want to Be. One of the chapters is 'Learn the ropes first, then conquer",137
NA,"Rome'. The story of the movie The Pursuit of Happyness, the true life story of Chris Gardner",137
NA,"is something that should be held up as an example of entrepreneurship, of tenacity and of hard",137
NA,"work, and the reason that having internships is such an important part of our economy.",137
NA,If Chris Gardner were here I am sure he would speak of the importance of internships and,137
NA,the importance of this coalition policy. We know what those in the Labor Party have. This is,137
NA,to the young Chris Gardners out there today in Australian society who will take advantage of,137
NA,"this policy to get themselves an internship, to lift themselves up and create a success of their",137
NA,"lives. To think that the Labor Party is going to vote against this, well, it tells us everything",137
NA,about the modern Labor Party. I commend the bill to the House.,137
NA,NA,137
Mr MCCORMACK ,Riverina-Minister for Small Business) (16:27): I rise to sum up on,138
NA,"the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016.",138
NA,This bill introduces legislative amendments that help give effect to the Youth Jobs PaTH,138
NA,Program announced in the 2016-17 budget as part of the Youth Employment Package. The,138
NA,best form of welfare that any government can provide is a job. We know that when seeking to,138
NA,enter the labour market for the very first time many young people do not have the skills and,138
NA,experience employers look for. This can make it harder to get a start. It can leave them,138
NA,susceptible to long-term unemployment and welfare dependency. The Liberal-Nationals,138
NA,government is committed to supporting young people to acquire the skills they need in order,138
NA,to move from welfare into work. The Youth Jobs PaTH-prepare-trial-hire-program will,138
NA,"maximise the chances of jobseekers under 25 in getting a job, in obtaining employment. It has",138
NA,three elements. Prepare: employability skills training to help young jobseekers learn the skills,138
NA,expected by employers so that they are more competitive when they are applying for a job.,138
NA,Trial: voluntary internships of four to 12 weeks to give jobseekers a chance to show what they,138
NA,"can do in a real workplace, with financial incentives to participate for both businesses and",138
NA,"jobseekers. Hire: a new youth bonus wage subsidy of up to $10,000 to support businesses",138
NA,wanting to hire young people.,138
NA,"These three initiatives-skills training, real work experience and wage subsidies-are an",138
NA,investment by the coalition government in the future of Australia's young people. Young,138
NA,people are the leaders of tomorrow. This will instil confidence and encourage their transition,138
NA,into employment. It will enhance their employability to maximise the chances of obtaining a,138
NA,job and moving off income support-obtaining a job and keeping that job. It will also allow,138
NA,them to experience a broad range of personal and financial opportunities that come with being,138
NA,employed. These amendments are designed to help young jobseekers by making sure that,138
NA,young people undertaking PaTH internships receive the full benefit of their participation.,138
NA,Youth Jobs PaTH internship incentive payments to participants will not be considered as,138
NA,"income for social security and veterans' entitlement purposes, and that is important. This",138
NA,means the participants will receive the full amount of the incentive payments on top of their,138
NA,existing social security payments or their veterans' entitlements. The amendments also aim to,138
NA,"ensure that eligible young people, in particular circumstances, will be able to have their social",138
NA,"security payments restored without having to make a new claim. If they lose their job, through",138
NA,"no fault of their own, with an eligible employer within 26 weeks of ceasing to receive income",138
NA,support they can then reconnect to government services and income support.,138
NA,"In conclusion, the passage of this bill will ensure young people are afforded every",138
NA,opportunity to become fully engaged and job ready to maximise their chances of finding work,138
NA,as quickly as possible. Youth unemployment imposes significant economic costs through,138
NA,"lower workforce participation and related welfare costs-as a regional member of parliament,",138
NA,"I know this as well as anyone, youth unemployment rates generally being higher in regional",138
NA,"areas than they are elsewhere-not to mention the greater social cost to the young person,",138
NA,their families and our local communities. It comes at a great cost.,138
NA,We cannot stand idly by while there are tens of thousands of young people who stand to be,138
NA,at risk of long-term welfare dependence-I would say intergenerational welfare dependence. I,138
NA,"call upon those in this place to support Youth Jobs PaTH and this legislation, which will give",138
NA,young jobseekers the full benefit of this program.,138

NA,Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.,140
NA,Consideration in Detail,140
NA,Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.,140
Mr HUSIC ,Chifley) (16:42): We have had the opportunity through the course of this,140
NA,debate to outline a number of concerns that we have about the program design that will be,140
NA,supported by the passage of this bill. This bill does two things: one is that it provides a top-up,140
NA,"to income support levels, and the second thing it does is that it allows someone to re-engage",140
NA,with the social security system if they have not been successful in holding down a job through,140
NA,the PaTH program.,140
NA,NA,140
NA,A number of us will no doubt be taking the opportunity during consideration in detail to,141
NA,"focus on different elements of the actual PaTH legislation that is being considered, and we",141
NA,would also like to take the opportunity to ask the government for answers to questions that we,141
NA,"feel were simply not answered by the government, with all due respect to the minister at the",141
NA,table. A series of concerns have been raised relating to things such as the definition of what an,141
NA,"intern would be and whether or not, for example, this bill would allow for the displacement of",141
NA,existing jobs. We also asked questions about whether or not wages would be undercut as a,141
NA,result of this system. Even with the top-up that is provided people will be paid at a rate that is,141
NA,"less than the national minimum wage, and we have expressed concerns about that.",141
NA,We have also expressed concerns about whether or not people who are in the unfortunate,141
NA,position of experiencing a workplace accident would be covered by workplace compensation,141
NA,legislation and what the arrangements would be around that. It is a bit hard to imagine that a,141
NA,"$200 top-up to income support will cover people in the instance where they are injured, have",141
NA,"significant medical costs, are unable to participate in the program and may be potentially",141
NA,"prevented, as a result of that injury, from taking up employment. These are all serious",141
NA,"questions and none of them, I say with the greatest of respect to the minister at the chair who",141
NA,"has been provided with the summation to provide to the House, has been addressed. So I think",141
NA,it is important that in consideration in detail these things be looked at.,141
NA,"Importantly, one of the issues is that this bill will enable, in effect, churn. It recognises that",141
NA,"there will be churn in this program-that is, that there will be people who will go through the",141
NA,"PaTH program, will potentially start with an employer and then not be retained by that",141
NA,employer and will have to re-engage with the social security system. So there are questions,141
NA,"that certainly arise out of schedule 2 of the government's bill, where it allows for a suspension",141
NA,instead of cancellation of income support. This addresses the need for safeguards in the event,141
NA,business fire employees within 26 weeks instead of following through on their commitment. I,141
NA,would like to ask: how much of this churn does the government estimate will happen as a,141
NA,result of the program? How many workers does the government anticipate will not make the,141
NA,full six months after participating in this program? With the government guarantee that,141
NA,businesses will not churn through free interns instead of hiring long-term employees? How,141
NA,will that churn be monitored? What steps will be put in place to identify it before interns are,141
NA,placed and after? Who will monitor those rates? Is a tip-off line in the National Customer,141
NA,"Service Line enough to pick up instances of churn across 30,000 placements in up to 20,000",141
NA,businesses a year? How will the government know whether interns are accepted and other,141
NA,employees in the organisations are retrenched? How much information about its company and,141
NA,its staffing will a business have to provide to be eligible to accept more interns under PaTH?,141
Mr MCCORMACK ,Riverina-Minister for Small Business) (16:47): I thank the,141
NA,member for Chifley-the shadow minister-for his questions. They are pertinent ones. I,141
NA,understand and acknowledge that. I am not going to endeavour to answer the hypothetical,141
NA,"questions towards the end of his consideration in detail, but some of those earlier in his",141
NA,remarks I will answer.,141
NA,The internship is an opportunity for individuals on income support to gain valuable work,141
NA,experience in a real workplace on a voluntary basis. There is nothing wrong with that. This,141
NA,"should not be confused with paid work, as individuals will continue to remain on income",141
NA,support whilst undertaking the internship. The youth employment package will equip young,141
NA,NA,141
NA,"jobseekers by getting them ready, giving them a go and getting them a job. I would have",142
NA,"thought, given those wonderful ideals, that Labor would have gotten on board with the bill as",142
NA,proposed by the government in its original form.,142
NA,I am asked how this form of work is legal and how it complies with the Fair Work Act. It is,142
NA,"not work; it is work experience, and like other work experience programs such as the National",142
NA,"Work Experience Program, internship participants will not be employees for the purposes of",142
NA,"the Fair Work Act. In particular, this is because the Social Security Act provides that people",142
NA,will not be employees for the purpose of the act merely because they are undertaking an,142
NA,activity under their employment pathway plan. No legislative change is needed to exempt the,142
NA,internships from the coverage of the Fair Work Act because of the following: the Social,142
NA,Security Legislation Amendment (Employment Services Reform) Bill 2008 amended 631C of,142
NA,the Social Security Act to provide that from July 2009 approved programs of work and any,142
NA,"other activities, including the employment pathway plan, did not give rise to an employer-",142
NA,employee relationship. That is important.,142
NA,"What protections will be in place to prevent employers from abusing the program,",142
NA,including displacement? I was asked that by the member for Chifley. Employers who,142
NA,participate in the internship program must be able to show real prospects of ongoing work.,142
NA,There will be safeguards to ensure that existing workers are not displaced. The program sets a,142
NA,maximum duration of 12 weeks and the number of weekly hours worked in a placement,142
NA,comes in at 25 hours. So internships will be voluntary for both businesses and jobseekers and,142
NA,"will be co-designed by them to ensure that placements meet both of their needs. Importantly,",142
NA,the government will closely monitor the way employers use the program to ensure they are,142
NA,not exploiting or churning-a word the member for Chifley used-and burning jobseekers.,142
NA,"Employers who are exploiting jobseekers will be blocked from using the program, as they",142
NA,should be.,142
NA,Employment services providers will also be responsible for brokering internship,142
NA,placements and ensuring places are consistent with program guidelines. This includes the,142
NA,safety of jobseekers. Everybody in this parliament is adamant that the safety of jobseekers and,142
NA,workers is always paramount. Although internships are not an employer-employee,142
NA,"relationship, businesses have a duty of care to provide a safe work environment-as the small",142
NA,business minister I know how important that is-and appropriate supervision for jobseekers,142
NA,undertaking internships. This includes ensuring compliance with applicable state and territory,142
NA,occupational health and safety legislation.,142
NA,I also have to say that the Youth Jobs PaTH initiative is going to be good for Aboriginal,142
NA,"jobseekers. I know the member for Chifley did not raise this, but he would probably like to",142
NA,"know that of the 115,000 Indigenous jobseekers in employment services, around 76,000-",142
NA,"roughly two-thirds-are being supported by jobactive, a further 29,000 are participating in the",142
NA,"remote Community Development Program and 9,000 in disability employment services.",142
NA,This is a good program. As the small business minister I commend it. I commend,142
NA,"businesses to get on board with the program. Moreover, I commend jobseekers to absolutely",142
NA,"take part and participate in this program because it will give them real meaning, real work and",142
NA,a real pathway for the future.,142
Ms BURNEY ,Barton) (16:51): I do not disagree with the sentiments of the Minister for,142
NA,Small Business. Labor believes in employment and youth employment as away of breaking,142
NA,NA,142
NA,"disadvantage. There is no question about that. However, the youth unemployment figures are",143
NA,"not reflected when you average out employment figures here in Australia, as is often done by",143
NA,the government. Spruiking unemployment figures is a smokescreen for the extreme level of,143
NA,"youth unemployment in many regions across this country, including the Central Coast and the",143
NA,Hunter. I know the figures for these areas very well. Employment is an important pathway out,143
NA,of entrenched disadvantage. There is no question about that. Where Labor parts ways and the,143
NA,reason that the member for Chifley has moved these amendments is the nature of this,143
NA,program. Please do not pretend that it is anything other than an election thought-bubble. We,143
NA,all watched it. We all saw it. There was no detail then and there seems to be even less detail,143
NA,now.,143
NA,The member for Chifley has highlighted a number of questions that we would like,143
NA,"answered. I have come out of the New South Wales parliament, where, strangely, ministers",143
NA,did answer the questions raised in debate by the opposition. That is why you have three,143
NA,"people sitting over there in those chairs, working away, I am assuming, to provide you with",143
NA,the answers to the questions that we are raising. That is what I am used to. It is sadly not what,143
NA,"I see in this parliament. The issue that I am very much wanting to know about, particularly",143
NA,"with my shadow portfolio responsibilities of human services, is where this program intersects",143
NA,in a real way with Centrelink and the administration of Centrelink. There must be a,143
NA,"connection somewhere if the participants are recipients of, I am assuming, mostly Newstart.",143
NA,"This concerns me deeply when I look at some of the real issues with Centrelink, particularly",143
NA,the lack of access to information and the extreme waiting times for people who are trying to,143
NA,"get some information about their situation. I was in the Northern Territory on the weekend,",143
NA,and people there were waiting between three and six hours to get some sort of response from,143
NA,Centrelink. The IT system is nothing short of clunky. The casualisation of the staff is extreme.,143
NA,It seems to me that these issues need to be considered in the administration of this program. In,143
NA,"fact, it is unclear to me how this program is going to be administered, where it is going to be",143
NA,administered from and what government agencies will have the responsibility for ensuring its,143
NA,overall implementation.,143
NA,I will be a little more specific. The questions I raise are very much a microcosm of what the,143
NA,member for Chifley raised. I would like to know where the checks and balances are for this,143
NA,"program. I have seen on countless occasions initiatives being undertaken, without real thought",143
NA,"as to what the actual consequences were going to be, and how the checks and balances were",143
NA,to be put in place. I want to know how many interns one firm can have. I want to see and have,143
NA,"explained to me, as we do on this side, what a detailed implementation plan is and whether",143
NA,"there is any evaluation, given the Auditor-General's report about a number of programs just",143
NA,recently. How will this program be implemented? Who will do it? What is the plan? And,143
NA,what agencies are going to be responsible in its implementation? Is there an evaluation plan,143
NA,built in? What will be counted in that evaluation plan? How will we know whether it is,143
NA,successful or not?,143
NA,The other issue is the human side of this. What will happen to a young person who is long-,143
NA,term unemployed-and this program is being held out to be the panacea for your long-term,143
NA,"unemployed-if they are placed as intern after intern, after intern, with never any real",143
NA,outcome because of the way in which the program is structured? It seems to me that these are,143
NA,"legitimate questions. I am not being cheeky, minister. I am asking these questions because I",143
NA,NA,143
NA,think they need to be answered to make sure that this program does what it says it is going to,144
NA,do- (Time expired),144
Mr MCCORMACK ,Riverina-Minister for Small Business) (16:56): I will answer the,144
NA,member for Barton's questions inasmuch as she asked about the relationship between,144
NA,Centrelink and the Department of Employment. Of course those organisations talk with each,144
NA,"other. They always do. They do with the coalition in government, they did when Labor was in",144
NA,power and they will continue to do that. That is just a given. This youth employment package,144
NA,was announced in the 2016-17 budget. It is an $840.3 million investment over four years to,144
NA,"assist young people to develop the ability, skills and real work experience they need to get a",144
NA,job.,144
NA,"The member for Barton, coming from Whitton as she does, would understand the",144
NA,importance of young people getting a job. I know she does. I know she served in the New,144
NA,South Wales parliament. I know she had a fine record of service to that state parliament. I,144
NA,"know that she, like me, as the small business minister, wants to see as many young people in",144
NA,jobs as possible. This package represents just that; it is a substantial investment in our youth.,144
NA,There could be no finer investment by a government than in our youth. It will ensure that,144
NA,"young Australians receive job ready skills, which will enable them to obtain a foothold in the",144
NA,job market. It will build on initiatives introduced by the government under the Youth,144
NA,Employment Strategy. And it will work to further boost young people's job prospects by,144
NA,helping them to be better prepared for the workplace.,144
NA,"The member for Barton asked whether it would lead to an intern after intern, after intern",144
NA,situation. I can understand the member for Barton asking that question. But I know as an,144
NA,"employer, before I got into parliament, as an editor of The Daily Advertiser newspaper at",144
NA,"Wagga Wagga and then as a small business owner, if you have a good intern and they prove",144
NA,they were job ready-once they prove that they are capable of doing what you want them to,144
NA,"do-you gave them a job. If there was a job there, you gave them that job. I am sure that",144
NA,"employers across Australia will relish the opportunity to get good, young people job ready,",144
NA,"focused on what they need to do, trained up and understanding the whys and wherefores of a",144
NA,"workplace. If a job becomes available, they will get that position. It just makes good sense. It",144
NA,"makes good business sense. It is what good bosses do. These measures, combined with",144
NA,"existing initiatives, including the Transition to Work Service, Empowering YOUth Initiatives",144
NA,"and the ParentsNext Project, will be putting young job seekers on a pathway to finding and,",144
NA,"most importantly, keeping a job.",144
NA,At the core of the youth employment package is the Social Security Legislation,144
NA,"Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016, the bill that we are considering",144
NA,in detail now. It is a $751.7 million initiative. It maximises the chances of jobseekers under 25,144
NA,years of age getting a job. That is the age group where many of them leave school and many,144
NA,"have seen their parents unemployed and their grandparents unemployed. We, as a",144
NA,"government, want to get those young people into jobs because the best way out of welfare is",144
NA,"into a job. The best way to a better future is a job. I understand that, as the Minister for Small",144
NA,Business. I know the members for Barton and Chifley and all those opposite get that. We on,144
NA,"this side, of course, get it, because we are the side that understands how important getting",144
NA,youth employed is.,144
NA,NA,144
NA,The youth employment package also includes measures on encouraging entrepreneurship,145
NA,"and self-employment, designed to encourage young Australians to start a business and to",145
NA,"create their own job. The package provides a step-by-step pathway to work, which directly",145
NA,deals with the major challenges to employment faced by young people-particularly in,145
NA,regional areas.,145
NA,"Whilst we are talking about regional areas and young people, we should also mention the",145
NA,"backpacker tax, and why we want to make sure that the backpacker tax is fixed at 19 per cent,",145
NA,"not 10½, so that foreign workers are faced with young Australians who are going to be paying",145
NA,"a higher level of tax. We want to make sure that we get that fruit picked, make sure that those",145
NA,"abattoirs are serviced, make sure that those pubs have the hospitality staff needed. There are",145
NA,"many provisions, not just this one. There are many pieces of legislation that are so important",145
NA,"and so critical to get through in these final few days of the 2016 parliament, to ensure that we",145
NA,get youth employed. And we must ensure that this particular legislation is carried.,145
Ms SHARKIE ,"Mayo) (17:01): Thank you, minister, for answering many of the questions",145
NA,"that I have, but there are still so many that remain unanswered. The PaTH program will affect",145
NA,"120,000 young people, so it is imperative that government gets it right, particularly as this",145
NA,program affects our most vulnerable people entering the workforce.,145
NA,"While I support the government in ensuring that we are supporting young people, I think",145
NA,that this is too important to leave so many areas vague or open to ministerial or administrative,145
NA,discretion. I would like to ask the minister a number of questions relating to this. To begin,145
NA,"with, how would the government ensure that employment service providers will explain to",145
NA,participants their rights in the workplace before an internship commences? How will the,145
NA,government disallow program participants from working beyond standard hours-for,145
NA,"example, not just beyond the standard number of hours per day and beyond the standard",145
NA,"number of continuous hours, but working without a break as well? We know young people",145
NA,are so eager to please and they are going to be so desperate for this free internship to turn into,145
NA,a job.,145
NA,In my electorate there is 17 per cent youth unemployment. I meet hundreds of young,145
NA,people who are so desperate for a job. How will the government ensure that participants are,145
NA,"able to afford the travel costs to attend the compulsory training components of the program,",145
NA,and what special conditions and consideration will be given to rural participants whose travel,145
NA,costs are considerably higher than other participants? The minister has a rural electorate like,145
NA,me. There are no cheap buses-there are no buses for young people to get on. They will need,145
NA,"to somehow put petrol in the car and then get to that place of work, which may be 20 or 30",145
NA,kilometres away. How will the government ensure that participation in the internships will be,145
NA,"purely voluntary, and there will be no penalty beyond losing internship payments for",145
NA,withdrawing from an internship?,145
NA,"I acknowledge the minister's comments in relation to the duty of care of the employer, but",145
NA,how will the government ensure that the health and safety of participants in internships will,145
NA,"be adequately protected and that adequate compensation will be available to participants,",145
NA,should they become sick or injured as a result of a workplace incident? I would be devastated,145
NA,"to think that I supported legislation where, six months down the track, a young person in a",145
NA,"butcher store who is so keen to work, so eager, loses their hand and then has no compensation",145
NA,and no rights of reply. I would be devastated to think that I supported that legislation.,145
NA,NA,145
NA,How will the government ensure that program participants are provided with sufficient,146
NA,"protections from bullying and sexual harassment? Again, we are talking about the most",146
NA,vulnerable people-many entering the workforce for the first time. How will the government,146
NA,ensure that large businesses do not abuse this scheme and use it purely as a source of cheap,146
NA,"labour, replacing existing jobs? Surely this program should not be designed for cafes? How",146
NA,long does it take to learn how to make a coffee and to go out and wait tables? This program,146
NA,"should be focused on people who are in trades, on where we know there will be jobs in the",146
NA,future and on where we know small businesses will be able to connect and put on apprentices,146
NA,"and trainees. We know that we have 160,000 less trainees and apprentices today than we had",146
NA,just a few years ago. That is where the focus of this must be.,146
NA,How will you ensure that there is sufficient focus and support for our most vulnerable,146
NA,"young people, for young people from Aboriginal backgrounds, young people who have had",146
NA,"possible connections with juvenile justice, and young people who are guardian-of-the-",146
NA,minister children? We need to ensure that those young people are properly supported and get,146
NA,the most out of this scheme.,146
NA,How will the government ensure that there are effective complaints systems in place for,146
NA,program participants concerned with unreasonable treatment by their host organisations? I,146
NA,would also like to touch upon the previous member's comments about the program being,146
NA,"properly reviewed and evaluated. Adding to that, I would like to say that it must be",146
NA,"independently evaluated, and that review must be publicly available.",146
NA,"In closing, I am very concerned about medically certified sickness or compassionate",146
NA,"reasons, such as even the death of a close family member, not being reasonable excuses for a",146
NA,program participant to end their involvement in the program. Surely this needs to be,146
NA,addressed.,146
Mr MCCORMACK ,Riverina-Minister for Small Business) (17:06): Thanks to the,146
NA,member for Mayo for her questions. They are important ones. I will just give a bit of an,146
NA,"outline of the program to attempt to relieve some of her fears and concerns, which I would say",146
NA,are unfounded. I can assure the member for Mayo it is a good program. It has been well,146
NA,"thought through, with consultation with key stakeholders and business groups, and in",146
NA,particular it provides jobs and hopes and opportunities for young Australians. The Jobs Youth,146
NA,PaTH improves upon and complements existing supporting programs by providing real world,146
NA,solutions to the real world employment challenges facing young people-young people in my,146
NA,"electorate of Riverina, young people in the honourable member's electorate of Mayo. I know",146
NA,her electorate well.,146
NA,"The employability skills training will be intensively delivered in two blocks of three weeks,",146
NA,and the close engagement with employers in the training's design means that it will deliver,146
NA,"real results. A wide range of organisations have already been consulted, as I have just",146
NA,"discussed, on the training and their feedback will inform its implementation. The internship",146
NA,placement is different from existing work experience activities because it delivers a formal,146
NA,opportunity for young people to understand the work environment and at the same time it,146
NA,gives employers an opportunity to ensure the job seeker is a good fit for their business. Other,146
NA,key differences include: under the internship job seekers will receive a $200 per fortnight,146
NA,"supplement on top of their income support payment, so that is a bonus, and employers will",146
NA,"receive an up-front payment of $1,000 to host an intern, so that is good for them too. So it is a",146
NA,NA,146
NA,win-win situation. Previous wage subsidies for youth under 30 provided employers with up to,147
NA,"$6,500, GST inclusive, over 12 months if they hired an eligible job seeker. The new youth",147
NA,"bonus wage subsidy provides up to $10,000 over six months. In addition, all wage subsidies",147
NA,"for job seekers aged 25 to 29 years-parents, Indigenous, mature age and the long-term",147
NA,"unemployed-will be further enhanced, including payment over six months.",147
NA,"The member for Mayo asked about sexual harassment, about bullying in the workplace and",147
NA,about safety in the workplace. I can assure her that all those fit under this legislation. Of,147
NA,course no government would put in a plan that was going to give bullies in the workplace the,147
NA,opportunity to perpetrate their crimes-and they are crimes-against young people. There has,147
NA,been some suggestion that participants are going to be paid only $4 an hour. The Australian,147
NA,Council of Trade Unions have suggested that. The claim that the scheme will see young,147
NA,"Australians paid so little per hour is a blatant lie, and the ACTU really should issue-",147
Mr Husic, Rubbish!,147
Mr MCCORMACK," No, it is not rubbish. They should issue an apology for trying to",147
NA,"mislead Australians. Dare I say it, that is typical of that organisation. Under the innovative",147
NA,"Youth Jobs PaTH plan, the payment of $200 per fortnight is on top of the existing income",147
NA,"support that the job seeker already receives. It is an opportunity for individuals, as I have said",147
NA,"before, with income support to gain valuable work experience in a real workplace on a",147
NA,"voluntary basis but with all the conditions that a usual employee would benefit from, would",147
NA,be subjected to and would have the experience of. This should not be confused with paid,147
NA,work as individuals will continue to stay on income support whilst undertaking the internship.,147
NA,This is a good employment package. It is good for youth. It is good for young Australians.,147
NA,"It makes them job ready. Many of them have not experienced this sort of undertaking before,",147
NA,"this sort of opportunity, and I can assure the member for Mayo that particularly for regional",147
NA,"areas, particularly for young people in country regions, this is a good deal for them. It makes",147
NA,them job ready. Employers and representative organisations such as the Business Council of,147
NA,Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry consistently state that young,147
NA,people need to improve their employability skills and have recent work experience. This,147
NA,PaTH program enables just that. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that more than,147
NA,"100,000 unemployed young people aged 15 to 24 have never worked before. It is a staggering",147
NA,statistic. Job seekers who undertake work experience are more likely to find sustainable,147
NA,ongoing employment. The department's administrative data for December 2014 showed that,147
NA,"of the job seekers who undertook unpaid work experience, almost half were in employment",147
NA,three months later compared to 26 per cent for other activities.,147
NA,Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (17:11): It is a sad day in Australian governance when,147
NA,a first-term opposition MP has to school a minister of the Crown on a piece of government,147
NA,legislation. The ACTU is absolutely right-it is $4 an hour on top of the Centrelink payment,147
NA,that they would normally already get. To say otherwise is simply a blatant falsehood. The,147
NA,minister and I share a history. I too am the former editor of a local newspaper-though not,147
NA,one quite so salubrious as The Daily Advertiser in Wagga! Our newspaper also had interns.,147
NA,"They were university interns, usually students in their third year, or graduates. The big",147
NA,difference between them and what is being proposed now is that they were what most people,147
NA,"would understand interns to be, which is young people learning on-the-job training for the",147
NA,profession of their choice-invaluable work experience. It was a win for the employer-we,147
NA,NA,147
NA,"got a warm body to give some extra work to-but they got training, they got mentorship and",148
NA,they got a body of work that they could then use when they went out to get a real job.,148
NA,The minister is quite right-if a good intern came along you would give them a job if a job,148
NA,was available. That is the key-if a job was available. The problem with this scheme is that it,148
NA,"promotes, it incentivises, churn. You are going to give $1,000 to an employer every 12 weeks.",148
NA,If you are a small business employer and you are on the bones of your bum a little bit and the,148
NA,opportunity is there to turf a worker every 12 weeks and get a thousand bucks every 12,148
NA,"weeks, you are going to take it up. The minister will assure us in a moment that that will",148
NA,"never happen-'Trust us, we would make sure that would not happen.' But I will tell you",148
NA,"what, Minister-people game the system all the time. They find the loopholes, they find the",148
NA,"gaps. Unless this is tied down and ironclad, that is what is going to happen. People will be",148
NA,"ripped off, kids will be churned through this system every 12 weeks and dodgy employers",148
NA,"will pocket that $1,000. One of my key concerns with this proposal is that it seeks to depress",148
NA,"wages. It essentially creates a pool of free labour, and that then depresses wages for",148
NA,everybody else in the community. It treats young people as disposable-it tells them they are,148
NA,"worth not quite as much as the rest of us. That, to me, is just not right.",148
NA,"I have a number of questions which hopefully the minister can answer in some detail. First,",148
NA,what happens if an intern sustains an injury at work?,148
NA,Are interns covered by workers' compensation? The government simply has not addressed,148
NA,this important question. Will the base $200 a fortnight include the possibility of being made to,148
NA,work on public holidays and weekends? Does a penalty rates regime apply for these times? I,148
NA,suspect it does not. What is going to happen? For a worker who gets penalty rates with these,148
NA,"times, the employer will say, 'There is a worker I have got to pay penalty rates to, and there is",148
NA,a free bit of labour.' Guess who will get those hours? It is absolutely outrageous. I would like,148
NA,some clarification on that. What qualification will an intern earn after four to 12 weeks in a,148
NA,workplace working 15 to 25 hours a week? Will they get a certificate? Will they get a trade,148
NA,"qualification? Will they get anything to send to another employer, or will it just be, 'Thanks",148
NA,"very much, on your way,' while somebody else comes in through the front door?",148
NA,The minister assures us there will be safeguards. When you are dealing with legislation of,148
NA,this magnitude and when you are dealing with the lives of hundreds of thousands of young,148
NA,"people, we need better in legislation than 'Just trust us.' We need to see the detail before it is",148
NA,put to the parliament. That is why Labor is going to seek to refer this to a Senate review. The,148
NA,minister said he can assure the member for Mayo that it is a good policy. She had some very,148
NA,"good questions. I, too, represent a rural seat and I, too, know young people who find it very",148
NA,difficult to get to work. They do not all have cars and public transport is absolutely woeful. It,148
NA,is very expensive to get around. These are questions that need to be answered as well.,148
NA,The minister said this will deal with the real-world challenges. A real-world challenge for,148
NA,young people is getting fair pay in the workplace. Australians have worked for generations to,148
NA,get fair pay and fair conditions for Australians in workplaces. We are simply not prepared to,148
NA,give it up on what is looking more and more like a dodgy free employment scheme.,148
Ms SWANSON ,Paterson) (17:16): I was listening intently to the minister as he said that,148
NA,there would be organisations that would broker partnerships for this program. I would like to,148
NA,directly ask the minister: which organisations will broker this program? Are they the same,148
NA,organisations that were completely decimated by the 2014 budget when the then Treasurer Mr,148
NA,NA,148
NA,Hockey stood up and announced that he would no longer continue the very successful,149
NA,brokerage partnership programs that had been occurring and which saw many young people,149
NA,"find work. After that, we saw an increase in joblessness with our young people. That was a",149
NA,direct result of what this government did to absolutely eliminate and annihilate those fantastic,149
NA,programs that were working and that this government did not support and did not continue.,149
NA,We on this side understand that youth unemployment truly is a scourge in our society and it,149
NA,is vital that we all work together to create the best environment that we can for our young,149
NA,"people to get a job. We welcome additional resources being invested in youth employment,",149
NA,"but I am convinced, as is Labor, that this Youth Jobs PaTH, as it stands, is not the best way to",149
NA,"support young jobseekers or invest Commonwealth funds. It is not a pathway to employment,",149
NA,"but, rather, a road to nowhere in my assessment.",149
NA,The amendment that Labor proposes seeks guarantees that this legislation will not be used,149
NA,to exploit young people or to undermine workforce standards. As the member for Mayo,149
NA,"pointed out, these young people are so keen to impress. They really are desperate for those",149
NA,jobs. How will they not be exploited? We have all been in situations where you might stay,149
NA,back for those extra couple of hours when you are trying your best to get an absolutely great,149
NA,opportunity. How will we ensure that these young people will not be exploited? We have real,149
NA,concerns about whether this actually presents a genuine opportunity for young people to gain,149
NA,meaningful employment or whether it is just going to be completely unworkable.,149
NA,There is no firm definition of what an intern is under the program or what sectors they,149
NA,could be asked to work in. Large numbers of participants could be used within companies at,149
NA,"one time, as we have already pointed out. There is a distinct difference between companies",149
NA,"and the organisations that brokered programs in the past, as was pointed out earlier in the day.",149
NA,"Also, large numbers of these interns could completely negate the need for existing employees",149
NA,"in certain sectors, such as hospitality. And, as my colleague just pointed out, the penalty rate",149
NA,issue is one of the most glaring ones. What is going to cover someone who should be paid the,149
NA,"appropriate penalty rates for being away from their family on a weekend, as opposed to an",149
NA,intern being brought in and being taken advantage of? These are real and genuine concerns,149
NA,that we have.,149
NA,"At a time when wages growth is at its lowest on record, there are very real concerns that",149
NA,the Youth Jobs PaTH program could be used to undermine wages across many industries. It,149
NA,will not be just young people and would-be workers who will suffer but all workers in lower-,149
NA,"paying jobs who would be forced to compete with what is, virtually, slave labour. The Youth",149
NA,Jobs PaTH program does not specify real job areas in which jobseekers will acquire skills. All,149
NA,we have been told is that these programs will give young people the skills that employers tell,149
NA,us that they need. We need to know what these skills are. What are they? How will it work? I,149
NA,still want to know the definition of an intern. I want to know what they will be doing and I,149
NA,"want to know what, more importantly, they will be learning. I want to know how this",149
NA,government can guarantee that it will not depress wages and I want the government to,149
NA,guarantee that it will not displace jobs.,149
NA,I also want the government to guarantee that it will provide vital access to workers',149
NA,"compensation. It is no good saying, 'Everything will be okay; they will be safe and we would",149
NA,"not put anything in place that would put anyone in a dire situation.' Well, I may be new but I",149
NA,am not quite that naive. We want to see this properly accounted for. The safety of our young,149
NA,NA,149
NA,people should be legislated. This government has an appalling record when it comes to,150
NA,helping young people. Apprenticeship numbers have been absolutely in freefall for the past,150
NA,"three years. We have had the VET scheme; we have had Work for the Dole, which has not",150
NA,"worked out well; and, I guarantee, in a few years we will be hearing how this has not worked",150
NA,out as well. These answers must be found.,150
Ms CHESTERS ,Bendigo) (17:21): I also have a number of questions for the Minister for,150
NA,"Small Business, or the person representing the minister-and we are not quite sure who that is",150
NA,"at the moment. Perhaps it is the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, who is sitting at the",150
NA,"table, who is now representing the minister on this issue. Hopefully whoever is going to",150
NA,"answer these questions is listening closely, because on this side we have raised a number of",150
NA,"serious questions that we believe the government needs to answer, and our friends on the",150
NA,crossbench have also raised questions in relation to this program.,150
NA,Since I made my speech on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path:,150
NA,"Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016 in the second reading debate, the government still has not",150
NA,responded to the concerns that I and many others raised. I reiterate the concerns about,150
NA,occupational health and safety. Where do these interns fit with regard to occupational health,150
NA,and safety? What happens if they are injured on a worksite? Do they complete a claim form?,150
NA,Are they entitled to workers compensation? Are they entitled to days off in payment of that?,150
NA,What happens if a worker is injured? We have already seen what has happened in the Work,150
NA,"for the Dole scheme. There is no responsibility whatsoever if somebody is injured, we have",150
NA,heard-and we know that a young person tragically lost their life while involved in a Work,150
NA,for the Dole scheme. We need the government to guarantee that that will not happen with this,150
NA,system.,150
NA,We have heard-and again the government has not responded on this-about the issue of,150
NA,pressure being applied to wages. This scheme says that somebody will get their youth,150
NA,allowance payments and $4 on top of that. What happens if they work on a weekend? Will,150
NA,they get an extra top-up for penalty rates? Is that being accounted for? What will this,150
NA,"government do to ensure that these interns are not being used late at night, in the evenings, on",150
NA,"penalty-rate days? Also, what is the government doing to ensure that these people, who will",150
NA,"effectively be on a payment of Newstart plus $4 an hour, are not undercutting jobs and",150
NA,workers in these places? What about in places where there is a collective agreement in place,150
NA,that pays much more than this? Will the government guarantee that workers are not displaced,150
NA,in terms of shifts or hours? Will it guarantee that these interns will not take hours away from,150
NA,casuals who are relying on shifts to make ends meet?,150
NA,"The government has also not been clear about how these interns will intersect with, and",150
NA,"what rights they will have under, the Fair Work Act. Again, the government has not been",150
NA,clear with the Australian people and with the prospective interns about how the Fair Work,150
NA,Act will apply to these young people. Will they have access to the unfair dismissal,150
NA,"provisions? The reason the government is twisted in so many knots is that, currently under the",150
NA,"Fair Work Act, there is no classification for an intern-none whatsoever. So, if a young",150
NA,"person who is engaged in the program is dismissed, what happens to their payments? The",150
NA,government has said that they need to be able to prove that it was not their fault. That is so,150
NA,"arbitrary. Who decides that dispute if an employer says, 'You're gone,' and the intern says,",150
NA,NA,150
NA,"'That's unfair'? Who is the arbiter? Who gets to decide that? If you are a worker, you are",151
NA,"protected under the unfair dismissal provisions. In this particular situation, we do not know.",151
NA,"Also, the government have still failed to prove that these are not $4-an-hour supermarket",151
NA,internships-a concern that has been raised not just by the union movement but by young,151
NA,people themselves. The government still have not convinced us or the Australian people that,151
NA,"this will not cut jobs. For a government that rant a lot about jobs and growth, they have failed",151
NA,"to demonstrate how this program will not take jobs away from young people, and they need to",151
NA,come in here and make that clear. It used to be considered a bit of a rite of passage that a,151
NA,young person's first job would be in retail or hospitality. The government need to guarantee,151
NA,"that, with this internship, they are not taking away jobs that otherwise would have gone to",151
NA,young people. They have failed to address that question. They have failed to answer that.,151
NA,They should come in here and address the concerns that have been raised not just by people in,151
NA,this House but by people within the community.,151
NA,Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (17:26): I have been sitting here very patiently waiting,151
NA,for the Minister for Small Business to actually answer my questions. This is consideration in,151
NA,"detail of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire)",151
NA,"Bill 2016, and I have been very polite, I think. I asked him what I thought were fairly decent",151
NA,questions about whether young people on these so-called internships will be paid penalty,151
NA,"rates, whether they will be made to work long and extraordinary hours through the night,",151
NA,whether they will be given access to transport options-all sorts of questions that the minister,151
NA,"has failed to answer, perhaps because the minister is no longer here. The Minister for Small",151
NA,Business seems to have so little interest in this matter that he has departed the chamber and,151
NA,"seems to have left his intern, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, in his place. I hope",151
NA,"you are getting more than $4 an hour, Minister! On the matter of highly paid interns, I cannot",151
NA,"go past the fact that my predecessor, the former member for Lyons Mr Eric Hutchinson, has",151
NA,"got a pretty nice internship himself, with Senator Stephen Parry, the President of the Senate. It",151
NA,"is a little more than $4 an hour, of course. It is around $160,000 a year, to attend functions. So",151
NA,that is not bad.,151
NA,I am happy to stand here all day-I am here all week-and wait for the minister to come,151
NA,into the chamber and actually answer some of the very serious questions that have been put by,151
NA,"me, the member for Mayo, the member for Paterson and the member for Bendigo, amongst",151
NA,others. These are very important questions. This is supposedly-so the government says-a,151
NA,panacea for the scourge of youth unemployment. I do not think there is anybody in here who,151
NA,is not desperately serious to see this matter addressed. Youth unemployment across the,151
NA,"country is far too high. Where we differ is on how to address it. On this side, what we know",151
NA,"is: you educate young people, you train young people and you provide them with pathways to",151
NA,"work via apprenticeships. Yes, there are legitimate internships, such as those that university",151
NA,"students and graduates go through, where they train for a short amount of time on the job and",151
NA,"they get a portfolio of work, they have mentorship and they are on their way. That is a",151
NA,legitimate internship. A legitimate internship is not being employed by the local fish and chip,151
NA,"shop, where the employer gets $1,000 to put you on behind the deep fryer, and you stand",151
NA,there for 12 weeks shuffling the fries and then you are out the door and somebody else walks,151
NA,"in. That is not a legitimate internship. That is free labour, and what that means is that the kid",151
NA,next door does not get that job. The kid next door does not get that job on proper wages,151
NA,NA,151
NA,because that job has been taken up by free labour paid for by the taxpayer. That is just a,152
NA,taxpayer-funded rort for business. It is just not right. So the member for Bendigo asked a very,152
NA,good question on those matters.,152
NA,I am still here; the minister still has not arrived. I do not know what could be keeping him.,152
NA,This is supposedly a very serious matter that the government has put to the House. We really,152
NA,need answers on these questions. I really would like to see him answer them.,152
Mr HUSIC ,Chifley) (17:30): What is becoming clear is this: this is a massive new,152
NA,program. What is being proposed here or what will be supported by this bill is something way,152
NA,"higher than what the government has ever done. They have an existing program, the National",152
NA,"Work Experience Program. It takes 6,000 people. This program boosts that up five times:",152
NA,"30,000 young Australians will go through this program. It is an entirely new system. A lot of",152
NA,people have legitimate concerns: that jobs will be displaced; that people who would have got,152
NA,a job independently will be replaced by an intern. And 'intern' has not even been defined;,152
NA,there is no definition from those opposite of what an 'intern' is. They may be an intern barista;,152
NA,they may be an intern construction worker; they may be an intern retail assistant-which,152
NA,completely flies in the face of what the general public thinks an intern is.,152
NA,Those people would be paid below the national minimum wage. Bear in mind: the national,152
NA,minimum wage right now is $17.70 an hour. But an intern who works 25 hours a week and,152
NA,receives only their Newstart payments plus the $200 top-up will earn $14.50 an hour. The,152
NA,small business minister was saying that the ACTU should apologise because they were,152
NA,misrepresenting the situation. Guess what? The stats are clear. These people-these interns;,152
NA,these young Australians-will be brought in at a lower rate than the national minimum wage.,152
NA,"As wisely observed by the member for Mayo, we have no understanding about what the",152
NA,span of hours will be on any given day. They are supposed to work 15 to 25 hours a week.,152
NA,How do we know that they will not work 12 hours a day without a break? That is a legitimate,152
NA,question that was being posed. We have had questions about whether or not penalty rates,152
NA,would be undermined.,152
NA,We have had a whole stack of concerns. But guess what? We are not going to get answers,152
NA,"today, because what is going to happen is: the minister at the table here is just going to do",152
NA,them as one job lot and thinks that he will answer them in five minutes. And he will not. None,152
NA,"of the questions that have been raised through the course of this consideration in detail, about",152
NA,"a program that is massively expanding on what is currently being done, that will involve",152
NA,young people-questions that everyone wants to get legitimate answers to-will not be,152
NA,answered by this government.,152
NA,"It is a clear demonstration that, as the member for Barton said, they engaged in an election",152
NA,"thought-bubble. Six months after this program was announced in the federal budget, they still",152
NA,cannot define what an intern is. They still cannot give us assurances that these people will be,152
NA,covered by workers' compensation. They still cannot give us assurances that the interns will,152
NA,"not be used to displace jobs, in a market where people are already underemployed.",152
NA,Underemployment is already at an all-time high. People are already concerned about wages,152
NA,growth flatlining. There are all these concerns out there. But this government will not answer.,152
NA,"And I am sorry, but-with the greatest respect to the minister, who I have great time for: it",152
NA,"is not good enough, Minister, to have all these members of parliament raise legitimate",152
NA,NA,152
NA,questions and to have them just pushed off into one five-minute job lot. Not only do these,153
NA,"members deserve answers; the Australian public, who will be seeing this new thought-bubble",153
NA,"unveiled, deserve answers as well.",153
NA,"It is basically April 2017 when this program comes in, and we still do not have answers",153
NA,about what is going to happen. I actually think we do need to get answers. We need to get,153
NA,"answers to the question about workers' compensation, because, in the submission made by the",153
NA,"department to the Senate inquiry that is going on now, published on the website, we are now",153
NA,told that the Department of Employment has insurance arrangements in place to cover,153
NA,"jobseekers undertaking activities, including group personal accident insurance and combined",153
NA,liability insurance. But what happens if someone is permanently incapacitated as a result of an,153
NA,accident through being involved in an internship? What happens to them? At what rate do,153
NA,they get paid out? At what rate can they expect income support? Where do they go? Do they,153
NA,go on to DSP? What happens there? They will be placed in the invidious situation of being,153
NA,locked out of the job market. And we do not even know the details about the coverage.,153
NA,"These are the types of questions that deserve to be answered, and they should not be treated",153
NA,"disrespectfully, through the way that they are being managed right now-with all due respect",153
NA,to the minister.,153
Mr CHESTER ,Gippsland-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:35): I thank,153
NA,"the members opposite for their questions and their contributions to this debate, and I thank",153
NA,them for their impending support for the bill which is before the House.,153
Mr Husic, We've still got questions!,153
Mr CHESTER, And there will be more questions. I am going to answer some of the ones,153
NA,"that I have got to in the last 10 or 15 minutes, Member for Chifley.",153
NA,"As the members are aware, the youth employment package was announced in the 2016-17",153
NA,"budget and is an investment in the order of $840 million, which will be implemented over",153
NA,four years to assist young people to develop their employability skills and provide them with,153
NA,the work experience they need to get a job. I thank the members opposite because I think they,153
NA,are very sincere in their enthusiasm for helping young Australians receive the job-ready skills,153
NA,they need which will enable them to obtain a foothold in the job market. It does build on other,153
NA,initiatives that the Turnbull government has implemented under the youth employment,153
NA,"strategy, which will further boost young people's job prospects by making sure they are in a",153
NA,position to be better prepared to join the workplace.,153
NA,Members asked questions as to: 'Why aren't the jobseekers undertaking internships paid at,153
NA,"the minimum wage?' Under this program, placements do not constitute an employer-employee",153
NA,relationship and do not involve wages or salaries. The jobseekers continue to receive their,153
NA,"income support as well as a $200 fortnightly supplement, which is paid by the Australian",153
NA,government. The program will provide those young jobseekers aged from 17 to 24 with an,153
NA,opportunity to show prospective employers what they can do in the workplace while gaining,153
NA,those valuable work skills and experience. I am sure members opposite would agree with me,153
NA,"that quite often all a young person needs is a chance to get a foothold, to get their foot in their",153
NA,"door, to demonstrate that they have the capacity to hold down employment. This internship",153
NA,program gives them a chance to prove their suitability for future employment.,153
NA,NA,153
NA,In terms of the question about whether it complies with the Fair Work Act: the internship is,154
NA,"not work; it is work experience, as members opposite would be aware. In relation to the need",154
NA,for such initiatives: it has been a matter of concern put to the government by organisations,154
NA,such as the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and,154
NA,"Industry, who have consistently stated that young people need to improve their employability",154
NA,"skills and to have had recent work experience. The ABS data shows that more than 100,000",154
NA,unemployed young people aged 15 to 24 have never worked before. That is an important,154
NA,consideration when we reflect on the position put by the government in relation to this,154
NA,"legislation-100,000 young people aged 15 to 24 have never actually worked before. Giving",154
NA,them the opportunity to prove their abilities in the workplace is an endeavour worth pursuing.,154
NA,In terms of protections to be put in place-and I acknowledge the questions raised by,154
NA,"several speakers regarding protections to prevent employers from abusing the program,",154
NA,"including the displacement effect, which I think some members referred to-employers who",154
NA,participate in the internship program must be able to show real prospects of ongoing work and,154
NA,there will be safeguards to ensure that existing workers are not displaced by the scheme. The,154
NA,"program sets a maximum duration of 12 weeks, and the number of weekly hours worked in",154
NA,the placement will be 25 hours. The internships will be voluntary for both the businesses and,154
NA,the jobseekers and be co-designed by them to ensure that the placements meet both their,154
NA,"needs. Again, that is an important consideration. For this to work, it has to be in the interests",154
NA,of the young person themselves and it also has to be seen to be of some benefit to the business,154
NA,"sector, which will be passing on the opportunity for these young people to learn those skills",154
NA,with the on-the-job training provided through the internship program. It will be up to the,154
NA,government to ensure-and I take the caution in the spirit that it was meant-that the program,154
NA,is closely monitored to ensure that the employers who use the program are not exploiting and,154
NA,"not, to use the vernacular, churning and burning young people by simply rotating them",154
NA,through. If they are seen to be exploiting young jobseekers they will be excluded from the,154
NA,program in the future.,154
NA,"I do want to acknowledge the contribution by members opposite, and I am sure there will",154
NA,be other questions that will be raised. But I would hasten to say that this is a comprehensive,154
NA,package that has targeted services and support for all unemployed young people. It is a well-,154
NA,"designed package, with an evidenced-based pathway to help young Australians into the",154
NA,"workplace. It offers, I think, a meaningful and rewarding opportunity for young jobseekers",154
NA,and employers a like to bridge the gap and to get young people working.,154
Ms SHARKIE ,"Mayo) (17:40): I will not take up too much more of the House's time, but",154
NA,"I do have a couple of concerns. Prior to me coming to this House, this was an area of my own",154
NA,employment. So it is something that I am particularly passionate about. The focus of this,154
NA,"program needs to be about young people. What I am not aware of, and what is not detailed in",154
NA,"the legislation, is: what career mentoring will be provided to the young person to ensure they",154
NA,"are placed in a work setting that will fit with their talent and their career goals, or will they",154
NA,just be shunted anywhere that suits the jobactive provider?,154
NA,"The minister has mentioned health and safety. In relation to my previous question, he said",154
NA,that it was in the legislation. But I could not see in the legislation any specific legislative,154
NA,"protections for young people. I note that the minister, now responding to the questions, has",154
NA,"detailed that this is not an employee-employer relationship. Therefore, my concerns are even",154
NA,NA,154
NA,"more heightened about the protection of young people, vulnerable people-many of whom, as",155
NA,"the minister acknowledged, have not even been in a work placement before. How do we know",155
NA,that they will be safe and respected in the workplace and that they will have rights and,155
NA,protections?,155
NA,I would like to ask why jobactive providers were chosen to deliver this. Why are they in,155
NA,the legislation? Why not Transition to Work providers? That is a government program. We,155
NA,know that they tendered out the program to youth specialist providers and organisations that,155
NA,are recognised and well respected across the industry. They know how to work with young,155
NA,people and they get the best out of young people. So why would this program be working,155
NA,through jobactive providers and not Transition to Work?,155
NA,Another query I have particularly relates to my electorate and to all rural electorates across,155
NA,Australia. If you are registered training organisation as well as possibly being the successful,155
NA,"provider of this program, you will not be able to train your young people in your RTO as well",155
NA,as place them into employment. I understand that the government was probably trying to,155
NA,ensure that there was not double-dipping-it is one of those favourite words at the moment.,155
NA,"However, when you are in a regional area, there is often one organisation and that",155
NA,organisation often only has one or two staff members. So it is really going to be impossible in,155
NA,regional and rural Australia for this program to be effectively delivered-and that is where I,155
NA,believe we need this program to be delivered the most.,155
NA,"In relation to the training, I would also like to say that, from my reading of the legislation, a",155
NA,young person will not receive that $200 per fortnight while they are in the training component,155
NA,"of this program; it is only when they are in the placement. Again, how do you afford to get to",155
NA,training? Anyone who is on youth allowance is only getting just over $400 a fortnight to live,155
NA,"on if they are on the independent rate. Out of that, they have to feed themselves, they have to",155
NA,clothe themselves and they have to cover rent. It is so far below the poverty line that the idea,155
NA,that we would have an expectation that a person would also get to their own training without,155
NA,any subsidies-which are provided under Work for the Dole but not under this program-,155
NA,while you are in the training component-seems grossly unfair.,155
NA,I would also like to talk about the trades and industries that will be targeted. I am very,155
NA,concerned that this will be a program that essentially will be picked up in hospitality and in,155
NA,retail-areas where we know it does not take 12 weeks to train a young person. We certainly,155
NA,"do not need any more baristas; what we need are plumbers, painters, electricians and",155
NA,hairdressers. We need people to work in a variety of areas where we know that there are,155
NA,career opportunities for young people where they will very quickly learn a range of skills that,155
NA,are transferrable and will have a certificate in their hand and they will not be making coffee at,155
NA,age 29 and waiting on tables. These young people deserve more than that.,155
NA,I would like to go back to a couple of other issues that I have raised previously. I am,155
NA,particularly concerned about the level of ministerial discretion and administrative discretion,155
NA,in this legislation. The government is spending an enormous amount of money on this,155
NA,program-so you have got to get it right. You cannot afford to waste this money and put,155
NA,"young people, who are our most vulnerable people, in the workforce in a worse situation.",155
Ms LAMB ,"Longman) (17:45): I was sitting in my office, watching what was happening",155
NA,down here in the chamber and I felt compelled to come on down and speak to this. It was just,155
NA,over a week ago that I found myself here speaking to the Social Security Legislation,155
NA,NA,155
NA,"Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. As I mentioned back then,",156
NA,Labor has always supported meaningful investment and initiatives that give young people a,156
NA,"real pathway towards long-term, stable employment because, as I am sure the minister would",156
NA,"agree, there is real dignity in having a job. I am a mother of four boys and they range from 16",156
NA,"to 26-so I am a mother and also a worker. Up until a few months ago, I was a worker just",156
NA,like my boys are. I know that there is real dignity in having a job. I know about being able to,156
NA,"put food on the table, to put a roof over your head, to be able to join the local sporting team",156
NA,"and to be a member of my community, and that comes from having a job. I know that",156
NA,firsthand. I would like to thank the member for Mayo for those questions that she raised and I,156
NA,look forward to waiting for the minister to answer them as well because I am keen to hear,156
NA,those answers.,156
NA,The point that I felt compelled to come down and make about this proposal is that there are,156
NA,several elements about the program that have the potential to undermine what our country has,156
NA,fought hard for in the way of workforce standards. The first thing I would like to raise is that,156
NA,we should all be alarmed by any proposal that allows a business to pay workers below the,156
NA,award rate. We have heard it a number of times before. I was in my suite and I could hear the,156
NA,minister arguing around $4 an hour. Having 17to 24-year-olds participate in an internship,156
NA,"for 25 hours a week, earning $100 a week-I do not need a calculator, but I am happy to get it",156
NA,out of my office and bring it down to the minister if he needs a hand-that is $4 an hour. If he,156
NA,"needs one, please pass it on that I can hand one over to him.",156
NA,I have always believed in a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. We have award rates in this,156
NA,"country because, as a society, we believe that low-paid workers should have economic",156
NA,"security and should be protected from exploitation. In question time today, I heard the Prime",156
NA,"Minister say, 'We back the workers.' Well, I tell you what, I wonder how that young,",156
NA,"Queensland, 7-Eleven worker feels about that backing of the Prime Minister. I wonder how",156
NA,backed that worker feels when I watch the video of that. The second concern I have got is the,156
NA,real risk of companies cycling through young workers and using them as cheap labour. You,156
NA,"could be working early mornings, you could be working late nights, you could be working",156
NA,weekends and you could work Christmas Day-nothing to stop you-in any industry at all.,156
NA,"In my electorate, we not only have unemployment but also have underemployment. Those",156
NA,are workers who are already working but are actually looking for more hours. The real risk is,156
NA,that they can lose their hours. You do need to look any further than Longman to have see how,156
NA,"underemployment is playing out. At Caboolture Community Action, where they feed the",156
NA,hungry and the homeless-and I have spoken about this great organisation a number of,156
NA,times-we are seeing more and more people turning up that do have jobs but do not have,156
NA,enough hours. There is enough money to put fuel in the car and there is enough money to pay,156
NA,the rent but there is not enough money for food. That is the real story of underemployment.,156
NA,"As I said before, we have always supported meaningful investment. We will always",156
NA,"support initiatives that give young people a pathway through unemployment because, like I",156
NA,"said, I know in Longman there is nothing more dignifying than having a decent job. Over the",156
NA,"last week, as I am sure many people have, I have been to a lot of school awards ceremonies",156
NA,"celebrating the achievements of our children, but the one thing that parents keep asking me",156
NA,"about, and the thing that always resonated with me, was jobs for our children. This is the stuff",156
NA,NA,156
NA,that is concerning for them. We cannot allow a proposal like this to go through unchecked.,157
NA,We must have security.,157
NA,My questions-and I am happy for him to get back to me on these-to the minister are:,157
NA,what guarantee will he give us that people will not lose their casual hours? Those people who,157
NA,"are underemployed already in my community, what guarantee will they have that they will",157
NA,not lose their casual hours that they want more of? What guarantee-and I heard the member,157
NA,for Mayo raise this as well-will our kids have that they will know their rights at work as they,157
NA,first start at a place of employment?,157
Mr HUSIC ,Chifley) (17:50): As has been evident through the course of the consideration,157
NA,"in detail, there are quite a few members within this chamber that have expressed deep",157
NA,concerns about the program design that will be supported by this bill. We think this is a major,157
NA,"new initiative by the government, which we have expressed concerns about from the get-go",157
NA,"that this has been rushed through, not thought through and that the program design has flaws",157
NA,"in there that could cause real problems for young, unemployed Australians. No-one for a",157
NA,moment is suggesting that youth unemployment in this country is not a problem; it is a,157
NA,"problem. No-one is suggesting that new measures do not need to be considered, particularly",157
NA,"given the performance of, for example, the Work for the Dole program that is unable to",157
NA,provide jobs for young Australians. Three months after they have completed Work for the,157
NA,"Dole, nearly 90 per cent of those participants do not find work. They are not in full-time jobs.",157
NA,"As I said during my contribution in the substantive debate, I was stunned at the blase way in",157
NA,which the departmental secretary said that Work for the Dole is not about finding a job. That,157
NA,would come as big news to the bulk of Australians who expect that a program like that will,157
NA,get people ready for employment. That program is tanking. This government has not found a,157
NA,way to reverse the slide for that program.,157
NA,"They have now come up with this program, a program which I note is modelled on",157
NA,"overseas programs, and others have also observed that this has been modelled on attempts",157
NA,"overseas to do similar things. In its submission to the Senate inquiry that is underway, the",157
NA,"ACTU raised valid concerns, which were dismissed by the Minister for Small Business-",157
NA,Ms Ryan: Shame!,157
Mr HUSIC," In response to the member for Lalor's interjection, it will be a shame if this",157
NA,program fails as well and falls in a heap and we have to come back here and address those,157
NA,"failures. In its submission, the ACTU said the United Kingdom tried a similar scheme, the",157
NA,"Youth Employment Scheme, YES, in 2013. This scheme was launched in January 2013 and",157
NA,"was wound up in July 2014, with fewer than half the estimated placements having been made",157
NA,"and no clear increase in real job placements. The YES scheme, like the Youth Jobs Path",157
NA,"program, had a top-up element for the participant, a subsidy for the employer-tick, tick; both",157
NA,of these things are available under the proposed program-a shorter work experience,157
NA,component and a longer skills development component.,157
NA,"That scheme tanked, so the question to the government is: if we look at overseas models,",157
NA,can you give assurances to the House that the model being proposed here and that is,157
NA,"supported by this bill will actually be successful? This is a $752 million program, Minister.",157
NA,There is $5.7 million allocated to it in this bill. Where is the rest? Has the $5.7 million taken,157
NA,into account the 'cycling through'-as the member for Longman referred to it-of people? We,157
NA,do not know that.,157
NA,NA,157
NA,The member for Longman mentioned the possibility of this cycling through. We are,158
NA,genuinely concerned that in some major businesses you will get a big group of these interns,158
NA,"being brought in who will, just coincidentally, be put on weekends where penalty rates would",158
NA,not apply to them because they are already getting their payment. But the people who were,158
NA,earning those penalty rates would suddenly find that they did not have to come in for that,158
NA,shift. That is a big issue for people in those positions. The biggest champions of this type of,158
NA,program have been within the hospitality sector. They have never engaged in the jobactive,158
NA,program. Big businesses have never taken up those jobactive jobseekers. It has been small and,158
NA,medium enterprises who have done so. But we find that the ones that are quoted by those,158
NA,opposite when they are talking about the program are these big champions: the Business,158
NA,Council of Australia and AiG. Of course they would champion it. The concern is that the,158
NA,smaller businesses that have done the great thing by the country and have taken on more and,158
NA,more jobactive participants will not be the ones that are prioritised under this program. That is,158
NA,an issue.,158
NA,We are watching this program closely. We are very concerned that people will be ripped,158
NA,"off, that the program will fail and that it will be young people who will be forced to carry the",158
NA,"cost, not this government, for a thought bubble announced in a budget leading into a hastily",158
NA,"called election. Minister, there are deep concerns about this program and what it will actually",158
NA,achieve.,158
Mr CHESTER ,Gippsland-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:55): In,158
NA,"closing, I would like to thank members opposite for their contributions to this debate on the",158
NA,"Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Jobs Path: Prepare, Trial, Hire) Bill 2016. I",158
NA,acknowledge the very genuine interest that many members have shown in what is an issue,158
NA,that has been particularly difficult for governments on both sides of this House to solve. If,158
NA,"solving youth unemployment were easy, the government would have solved it in the last three",158
NA,years or those opposite would have solved it in their six years. It simply has proven to be,158
NA,quite an intractable issue for federal governments to manage.,158
NA,The minister responsible is open to the practical suggestions that have been put forward by,158
NA,"those opposite, and I am sure that there will be more opportunities for that conversation to",158
NA,occur. I think we have a shared desire across the chamber to get more young people off the,158
NA,"dole, get them off unemployment benefits and get them into employment, and this is an",158
NA,important piece of legislation in that. It provides for $840 million over four years.,158
NA,I take up the comments of at least one previous member who said that there is real dignity,158
NA,in having a job. This program is about trying to find ways to get young people work,158
NA,experience so they go on to have meaningful employment. We believe the package will work,158
NA,because it provides a step-by-step pathway for young people to deal with some of those major,158
NA,challenges that young people in particular face when it comes to finding employment. These,158
NA,"challenges are a lack of employability skills, a lack of experience and difficulties in",158
NA,competing with other jobseekers when it comes to actually being selected for the job.,158
NA,"We believe that this program will have good support from the business sector, particularly",158
NA,"in the small business sector, which is a critical employer of young people right around",158
NA,"Australia. It is well placed to give young people that chance, that foot in the door, that",158
NA,opportunity to learn new skills that may well lead to their overcoming any barriers that they,158
NA,"may face in getting established in the workplace. Once they get that first opportunity, I am",158
NA,NA,158
NA,"very confident that they will have the capacity to develop a work ethic, which will stand them",159
NA,in good stead in the future.,159
NA,It is important to stress-and several members have raised this issue-that under this,159
NA,"internship approach jobseekers will receive a $200 per fortnight supplement, which is on top",159
NA,of their income support payment. It is important for members to recognise that. The young,159
NA,people participating in this program will retain their income support payment and receive a,159
NA,supplement on top of it. So it is not $4 per hour; it is actually a payment on top of the benefit,159
NA,"they are already receiving, which is provided by Australian taxpayers. It is true that the",159
NA,"employers will also receive an up-front payment in the order of $1,000 to host and intern. As I",159
NA,"said in my previous comments, it is up to the government to make sure that any businesses",159
NA,found to be exploiting the system are forced off it and to provide those protections for the,159
NA,young unemployed people. Internships will be voluntary for both the businesses and the,159
NA,young people involved. They will be co-designed by them to make sure the needs of both are,159
NA,met. I commend the bill to the House.,159
NA,Bill agreed to.,159
NA,Third Reading,159
Mr CHESTER ,Gippsland-Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:59): by,159
NA,leave-I move:,159
NA,That this bill be now read a third time.,159
NA,Question agreed to.,159
NA,Bill read a third time.,159
NA,Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016,159
NA,Second Reading,159
NA,Consideration resumed of the motion:,159
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,159
Mr DREYFUS ,Isaacs-Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (17:59): Labor takes a,159
NA,bipartisan approach to all matters of national security. We will always act to ensure that our,159
NA,"police and armed forces, both domestically and abroad, have the powers they need to combat",159
NA,terrorism.,159
NA,The Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016 updates Australian domestic law,159
NA,to reflect changes in international law in relation to the treatment of members of organised,159
NA,armed groups in non-international armed conflict. It reduces legal uncertainty for our armed,159
NA,forces overseas when they engage with non-state armed groups such as ISIL. It is an,159
NA,"unfortunate reality that, in the last few decades, groups like ISIL, rather than hostile nations,",159
NA,have become the main threat with which we are forced to engage overseas. It has taken a,159
NA,while for international and domestic legal systems to catch up with that change.,159
NA,These amendments provide legal certainty to members of the Australian Defence Force so,159
NA,that they can target members of organised armed groups with lethal force without the risk of,159
NA,"potentially committing an offence under Australian domestic law. In particular, this bill",159
NA,"amends division 268 of the Criminal Code, which provides for offences in relation to",159
NA,"genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes against the administration of",159
NA,"justice in the International Criminal Court. If passed, it will mean that war crimes offences",159
NA,NA,159
NA,only apply if the person or persons affected are neither taking an active part in the hostilities,160
NA,"nor are members of an organised armed group, and the perpetrator knows of or is reckless as",160
NA,to the factual circumstances establishing that the person or persons are neither taking an active,160
NA,part in the hostilities nor are members of an organised armed group.,160
NA,Other parts of the bill amend sections of the Criminal Code which apply the international,160
NA,humanitarian law principle of proportionality in relation to attacks on military objectives in,160
NA,non-international armed conflicts. Other small amendments have been made to reflect,160
NA,changes to international law.,160
NA,This bill was thoroughly scrutinised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence,160
NA,"and Security, the PJCIS, as with all national security bills which pass through this parliament.",160
NA,"The PJCIS was fortunate to have amongst its members the member for Eden-Monaro who, as",160
NA,"a distinguished former member of the Australian Army Legal Corps, has specific expertise in",160
NA,relevant areas of international law. I thank him for his counsel in this matter. The PJCIS heard,160
NA,"evidence from the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Defence and eminent",160
NA,international lawyers Professor Tim MCCormack and Professor Ben Saul.,160
NA,One point of concern for the committee was to ensure that there is a clear understanding of,160
NA,what is meant by 'members of an organised armed group'. Such groups can often contain a,160
NA,"number of different actors, not just combatants-support personnel, for instance, and even",160
NA,"administrative personnel. Non-state groups, by their nature, are formed of very different kinds",160
NA,of personnel when compared to national armies-they are often not so organised or,160
NA,"professional in their constitution. However, it is worth noting that this would not appear to be",160
NA,"the case when it comes to ISIL, which is just as highly organised as some armies.",160
NA,Professor Saul noted that there was some controversy in international law as to the,160
NA,definition of 'members of an organised armed group' and suggested that it be defined as 'those,160
NA,"with a continuous combat function within that group'. The committee's report notes that, while",160
NA,the most appropriate approach to determining membership of an organised armed group,160
NA,"continues to be debated, Australia's key coalition partners and allies already operate in",160
NA,accordance with the international law which this bill will extend to cover Australian forces.,160
NA,This approach aims to treat organised armed groups on an equal footing with state armed,160
NA,"forces and recognises that members of those groups, whether they are direct combatants",160
NA,"providing combat support or providing combat service support, are all contributing to the",160
NA,military effort of the group and should not be given the same protection as civilians in an,160
NA,armed conflict.,160
NA,The explanatory memorandum to the bill also makes clear that the term 'organised armed,160
NA,"group' is to be interpreted in a constrained way, such that persons performing civilian-type",160
NA,functions in territory controlled by an organised armed group would not be considered to be,160
NA,members of that group for the purpose of the legislation. This is a complex area of,160
NA,"international law, and it is right that a nuanced approach is taken.",160
NA,"The rise of ISIL, and al-Qaeda before it, has changed much about our world. It has made",160
NA,global theatres of conflict far less rigid and more difficult to define. It means conflicts,160
NA,"crisscross state borders and national jurisdictions, drawing in far more players and introducing",160
NA,highly complex dynamics. Such changes have elevated the role of international law as a,160
NA,means of regulating conflict. This is a necessary outcome of conflicts no longer taking place,160
NA,"country to country but country to non-state-armed group, with many different theatres of",160
NA,NA,160
NA,conflict. Therefore it is right and necessary that Australian law is kept up to date with,161
NA,international law.,161
NA,Our armed forces have been doing a superb job in this new and uncertain world. Outgoing,161
NA,"United States President Barack Obama praised the 'remarkable' work of our armed forces,",161
NA,"noting that, after the United States, Australian forces are the largest on-the-ground presence in",161
NA,the fight against ISIL. Labor supports our armed forces in this important work. By fighting,161
NA,"terror at its source, they are helping to keep Australians safe. It is right that, when Australian",161
NA,"servicemen and women engage in armed conflict against ISIL and other like groups overseas,",161
NA,"they are given legal certainty about what they are doing. They cannot do their job properly, if",161
NA,there is the remotest concern about the legality under Australian law. I am pleased that this,161
NA,bill will offer them that certainty.,161
NA,"In recent years in Australia, notably under the prime ministership of the now member for",161
NA,"Warringah, the debate about counterterrorism measures in this country had a tendency to",161
NA,"reach a hysterical fever pitch. Instead of looking after the best interests of our country, the",161
NA,government seemed far more interested in playing wedge politics. I am happy to say that it,161
NA,"appears that time has passed under the current prime ministership, and a calmer and bipartisan",161
NA,"attitude to matters of national security has been resumed. Among all the storm and fury, it is",161
NA,important to note that our armed forces have been getting on with the job overseas. We should,161
NA,be very proud of what they have achieved so far and continue to achieve. Labor will support,161
NA,them every step of the way.,161
NA,"In the short number of sitting weeks allocated to the 45th Parliament so far, the",161
NA,Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has handled five inquiries and,161
NA,produced the same number of completed reports. Some of these reports have been on highly,161
NA,"complex bills, unprecedented in Australia or even the developed world. It speaks volumes for",161
NA,the work ethic and skill of the PJCIS secretariat that such a great amount of work has been,161
NA,completed in such a short time.,161
NA,"As it did in the 44th Parliament, Labor has taken a steadfast bipartisan approach to these",161
NA,bills. We have worked cooperatively with the new membership of the Parliamentary Joint,161
NA,"Committee on Intelligence and Security, and its new chair the member for Deakin, to come to",161
NA,"agreement on many difficult issues. It is an effort that I am proud of, and I think that other",161
NA,members of the committee can be proud too. The agreement reached on the passage of this,161
NA,"bill is one of the fruits of this cooperative working relationship. I, on behalf of Labor, will",161
NA,work to ensure that relationship continues. I commend the bill to the House.,161
Mr SUKKAR ,Deakin) (18:09): It is good to be able to follow the member for Isaacs',161
NA,contribution on Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016. I want to echo his,161
NA,"sentiments, as Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, that",161
NA,"we have had a big workload. This has been part of that workload, but the urgency with which",161
NA,we have worked in a cooperative way to review and ultimately recommend that this bill be,161
NA,"passed is really for one purpose, and that is to give legal certainty to our men and women in",161
NA,the ADF.,161
NA,"It is a credit to the leadership of our Prime Minister, who has put his full imprimatur behind",161
NA,"this, to bring forward a legal uncertainty-that has certainly been in place for a very long time",161
NA,as the member for Isaacs has said-an area where Australian domestic law has not kept pace,161
NA,"with international law. It has been an ambiguity for some time but it took our Prime Minister,",161
NA,NA,161
NA,"this Prime Minister, to elevate the issue and ensure that we are now seeking to plug that gap.",162
NA,"So I want to give credit of course to the PJCIS, I want to give credit to all of the members,",162
NA,"including the member for Isaacs, and I want to give credit also to the secretariat who have",162
NA,done an amazing job in relation to this bill.,162
NA,"In essence, as I have just said, the purpose of this bill and the purpose of these amendments",162
NA,is to bring into line the Australian domestic law with international law in the way we treat,162
NA,members of organised groups in noninternational armed conflict. The bill represents a key,162
NA,component of a range and suite of responses and measures that this government is seeking to,162
NA,implement to ensure that the threat of terrorism is addressed not only here on our own shores,162
NA,"but from where it springs, particularly in the Middle East.",162
NA,In essence the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the ADF is able to target,162
NA,"members of organised terrorist groups. That, in its essence, is what we are ensuring that they",162
NA,"can do and, importantly, these amendments, in my view, will be crucial to the ongoing",162
NA,operations of the ADF against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.,162
NA,"We know that members of these terrorist militias act as combatants, and our ADF",162
NA,personnel should be able to engage with them as such. This bill achieves its intended aims,162
NA,primarily through amending several sections of war crimes offences in division 268 of the,162
NA,Criminal Code and to introduce the concept of organised armed group in noninternational,162
NA,armed conflicts.,162
NA,The proposed amendments draw a clear distinction between civilians on one hand and,162
NA,"members of organised armed groups. As division 268 currently stands, war crimes offences",162
NA,may allow members of the ADF to be held liable for action against members of these armed,162
NA,groups in a noninternational armed conflict.,162
NA,Schedule 1 of the bill contains four parts. Part I will amend the war crimes offences in,162
NA,"268.70, 268.71 and 268.72 of the Criminal Code relating to murder, mutilation and cruel",162
NA,treatment of persons in the context of noninternational armed conflict so that those offences,162
NA,would only apply if the persons are either not taking part in the hostilities nor are they,162
NA,members of that relevant organised armed group-in this case Daesh-and the perpetrator,162
NA,knows of or is reckless as to the factual circumstances establishing that that person is not a,162
NA,member or taking active part in those hostilities. The bill also introductions the principle of,162
NA,proportionality in relation to attacks on military objectives in noninternational armed,162
NA,conflicts. This is done by amending other provisions in division 268.,162
NA,"In broad terms, what I would like to conclude by saying-and I do not intend to use my",162
NA,entire allocation of time here because these issues I think have been aired very,162
NA,comprehensively not only by the Prime Minister but also the Leader of the Opposition. What,162
NA,we are seeking to do here is just to ensure that we can operate with our partners in armed,162
NA,"conflicts in an environment where those whom we are fighting, those whom we are opposing",162
NA,are unconventional in the way they operate-unconventional in the sense that they are not a,162
NA,state. We do not think that via technical aspects of our domestic law they should be protected,162
NA,"by provisions that, when originally drafted, were intended to protect civilians and those who",162
NA,were not engaged in activities that assisted in those hostilities.,162
NA,"So this is, in a sense, an uncontroversial change. But, as with all amendments in relation to",162
NA,"the fear of war, they of course require significant review. I am pleased that we have conducted",162
NA,NA,162
NA,that review through the PJCIS in a very thorough way. We were obviously assisted by the fact,163
NA,"that the will of our ADF, the will of our security and intelligence agencies was so one-sided as",163
NA,"far as these proposed amendments go, because we do not want any Australian member of the",163
NA,"ADF to, in any way, be potentially subject to negative legal recourse by defending the values",163
NA,of our country and by defending the values of Western liberal democracy in fighting,163
NA,"organisations like Daesh. It is for that reason that, again, I want to thank the Prime Minister,",163
NA,"the Attorney-General; of course, I want to thank the PJCIS.",163
NA,I commend these amendments to the House.,163
NA,Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (18:16): I acknowledge the previous comments of,163
NA,"both the shadow Attorney-General and the chair of the PJCIS, the member for Deakin, and I",163
NA,congratulate him on his appointment as the chair of that committee. He is doing a very good,163
NA,job of getting that ball rolling with a lot of new members on the committee. It is a great,163
NA,privilege to be a member of the committee. We have a lot of fine experience and expertise,163
NA,that has been brought to bear through the membership. It does do very important work on an,163
NA,important bipartisan basis. A lot of people who sit outside this building often only see the,163
NA,parliament through the prism of question time and do not realise that there is such a deep,163
NA,"body of work that is done on a very good, cooperative, bipartisan basis outside of those",163
NA,theatrical moments in here.,163
NA,I also really want to acknowledge: the input of Major General John Frewen and his ADF,163
NA,"team, who came and were very generous with their support in answering questions from the",163
NA,"committee; the Attorney-General's; and, in particular, too, the committee's support staff, who",163
NA,are a very good team who have provided tremendous support in what has been a very busy,163
NA,"period. Also, I would like to acknowledge the public contributions that were made by the",163
NA,"ICRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross, who I have had the privilege of working",163
NA,"closely with over many, many decades now-30 years, really. I also acknowledge professors",163
NA,"Ben Saul and Tim MCCormack, who provided very good quality contributions. Professor Tim",163
NA,MCCormack is someone who I have known for many years and who I worked very closely,163
NA,with. He has supported the ADF in working our way through from some very difficult and,163
NA,challenging issues very much like the subject matter that this legislation deals with.,163
NA,I would like to build on the comment that the shadow Attorney-General made about,163
NA,Labor's willingness to work with the government on security issues. I can assure the House,163
NA,"and the community in general that Labor has a very solid, dependable and strong national",163
NA,"security policy team. In particular, the Leader of the Opposition has very sound instincts on",163
NA,these issues. I would not be here if that was not the case. I think we have very solid grounds to,163
NA,be confident that the management of national security from both the government and,163
NA,opposition points of view is being conducted on a sound basis. We have been reinforced on,163
NA,the opposition side by the addition of very fine members in the member for Cowan and also,163
NA,"the member for Solomon, who brings to this parliament his military experience as well. He is",163
NA,a good friend who I knew before his time in the parliament.,163
NA,We have heard some specific details about the legislation. But to put it in context-I think,163
NA,this is very important to understand-the Defence Force and all of our military forces in the,163
NA,free would have been coming to grips with very difficult circumstances since the end of the,163
NA,Second World War. A lot of our operational circumstances have been characterised by these,163
NA,situations of dealing with non-state actors. They are very difficult situations of actually being,163
NA,NA,163
NA,able to identify the enemy in many circumstances. I think that was particularly characteristic,164
NA,"in situations like Vietnam, which added extra tension and stress for our members of the",164
NA,"Defence Force who returned and had ongoing, lingering problems afterwards that were not",164
NA,well understood. It is very important for us to provide as much clarity as we can in those,164
NA,"operational circumstances, but it is also important that we are very careful in the way that we",164
NA,structure our targeting processes and the way we use force and deploy force judiciously in,164
NA,counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations. Any time that you cause collateral civilian,164
NA,casualties you will be potentially setting back your overall strategic mission.,164
NA,"I speak as someone who was involved in the Defence Force for 30 years, but who has",164
NA,"recently separated from the reserve. In that time, I can reassure the community and the House,",164
NA,"the Australian Defence Force always operated at the upper end, the highest end, of",164
NA,"requirements of international law. In addition to that, in these circumstances-and bearing in",164
NA,mind the importance of discipline in targeting-the Defence Force operates well beyond the,164
NA,"requirements of law in many circumstances, as well, understanding the importance of the",164
NA,impact of its decisions and the use of force in general.,164
NA,This legislation effectively takes into account a history and tradition of those conflicts and,164
NA,the development of the law to try and catch up with those circumstances. We have had,164
NA,through the Geneva Convention post Second World War the additional of Common Article 3.,164
NA,"It dealt with non-international armed conflicts, but was very inadequate in dealing with all the",164
NA,complexity.,164
NA,"Beyond that time, we had the development of additional protocol I and additional protocol",164
NA,"II in particular, which deals with non-international armed conflicts in even more detail. Then,",164
NA,"of course, we saw the development of the Rome statute, which tried to codify in practical",164
NA,terms all of this experience in reality. We had a body of law that was also evolved from the,164
NA,"tribunal that dealt with the situation of the Bosnian conflict, trying to define these issues of",164
NA,"members of organisations, what armed organisations are and putting some definition around",164
NA,that.,164
NA,"Really, what this legislation does is acknowledge that, in the circumstances that we are in",164
NA,"in Iraq, for example, you have an armed organisation with individuals who are not only",164
NA,providing direct support to combat activities and engaging in those combat activities but,164
NA,providing what we from a military background would call combat support and combat,164
NA,services support. That is wrapped around the facilitation of military operations through what,164
NA,you might call engineering support in more professional circumstances but also in the,164
NA,logistics of conducting these operations and attacks. We recognise that in Iraq we have a non-,164
NA,state organisation that effectively controls large amounts of territory and is able to operate,164
NA,close to the state-like capacities in controlling that territory-financial resources and ordnance,164
NA,"and military resources. This obviously poses a particular issue for our people, who have to, if",164
NA,"you like, deal with the definition of a proper target in those circumstances. What we found",164
NA,was that the translation of what actually existed in international law was not effective in the,164
NA,way that the Criminal Code was developed in dealing with what we had refined through the,164
NA,Rome statute and state practice and experience.,164
NA,"This legislation effectively deals with that situation, and it is so important to take away the",164
NA,uncertainty for our defence personnel. We do not want to expose them to any allegations of,164
NA,"having conducted themselves inappropriately, potential criminal action and that sort of thing.",164
NA,NA,164
NA,"So these amendments open up our targeting possibilities in Iraq, which have been constrained",165
NA,with that problem hanging over our personnel. They will be able to go out there and,165
NA,effectively prosecute operations against those people that we know are actively participating,165
NA,in this conflict against our forces and against the coalition forces and Iraqi forces so that we,165
NA,"can bring this operation to a successful conclusion and rid the world, at least at this level of its",165
NA,"current threat, of an organisation and of people who are, quite rightly, determined as evil and",165
NA,as a force that must be confronted by the free world and its forces.,165
NA,I commend the men and women of our Australian Defence Force who have been engaged,165
NA,"in that effort. It is an effort which is not just about dealing, as we would say, kinetically with",165
NA,the enemy but about building the capacity of the Iraqi security forces so that they will be able,165
NA,"to take charge of their own security. Ultimately, the mission is to make ourselves redundant.",165
NA,"As in many circumstances we have found ourselves in along those lines, whether in",165
NA,"Afghanistan, in Iraq or in other conflicts around our own region-for example, Timor, Samoa",165
NA,and other places-it is about building capacity so that we can not only withdraw our own,165
NA,input but ensure that those locations do not descend back into circumstances where we need,165
NA,to intervene in the future. I think we should have learned a lot of lessons out of Iraq in that,165
NA,respect. Having gone through all the expense of blood and treasure and having spent a year,165
NA,"there myself working with coalition forces to try and achieve that result, and failing miserably",165
NA,because we did not address effectively the 80 per cent equation of the counterinsurgency,165
NA,"theorem-that is, 20 per cent security and 80 per cent social, economic and political and those",165
NA,"two things needing to be meshed effectively-we did not do a good enough job of that, which",165
NA,led to the situation where we are back there now. So it is important that we get it right this,165
NA,"time, and this legislation is really part of that story.",165
NA,"I reassure the House that, as I have said, the targeting discipline of our Australian defence",165
NA,forces is top-class. It has often been the case in all of the deployments I have been in that,165
NA,Australian operators and targeteers have had a very positive influence in the coalition,165
NA,circumstances they have been in. We take to the table an approach that has also influenced,165
NA,"other coalition partners to be extremely careful with that targeting process, which has had a",165
NA,very positive influence on the way these operations have been conducted.,165
NA,"I will say that we are now in this process of the post-US election period, where we are now",165
NA,all looking to see what the new approach will be of the US administration after President-elect,165
NA,"Trump is sworn in. Of course, during the campaign there was a lot of hyperbole and rhetoric,",165
NA,"as there always is in political campaigns, but there was a lot of talk around how we deal with",165
NA,Daesh and some people may be concerned about whether we would be moving to a new,165
NA,approach that may lead to indiscriminate targeting. Certainly we would hope that will not be,165
NA,"the case. Really, it will be a lot about what the appointments of the administration are and",165
NA,how the information and departmental support are dealt with in that process of setting up this,165
NA,"new administration, but I do note that President-elect Trump is considering the appointment",165
NA,of General Mattis as Secretary of Defense. General Mattis was with us in Iraq. At the time,165
NA,"that I was there, he was in command of the 1st Marine Division, which is a division well",165
NA,known to Australia. Its symbol-its shoulder flash-is the Southern Cross and its formation,165
NA,anthem is Waltzing Matilda. So we have quite a historic familiarity with the 1st Marine,165
NA,"Division. General Mattis was quite a character, he said a lot of colourful things and his",165
NA,"nickname is quite colourful, but I want to reassure people that this is someone we could have",165
NA,NA,165
NA,confidence in. He would be a good adviser in circumstances like this. He is someone who,166
NA,"grew up in that marine tradition under Commandant Krulak of the Three Block War,",166
NA,understanding those complexities and depths and levels of operation. It is a bit like 3D chess,166
NA,"these days, but he understood that. He grew up in that conceptual regime and also helped",166
NA,"them write better counterinsurgency, or COIN, doctrine for the marines and the US Armed",166
NA,Forces. So he does understand counterinsurgency theory very well and the judicious use of,166
NA,"force, with a very exemplary career in the military himself in many different circumstances.",166
NA,So I would be reassured if he is finally appointed as the Secretary of Defense for a Trump,166
NA,administration.,166
NA,"I want to, again, thank the members of the committee and those who provided the material",166
NA,for the committee to come up with a good result on this legislation. This committee is,166
NA,providing a very good mechanism for vetting measures on security. Everything that has gone,166
NA,"into that committee, in my experience over the last three years as a security adviser for the",166
NA,"Leader of the Opposition and now in this role, has always been improved as it has come out",166
NA,"the other end of the funnel and, as I say, always in a very good bipartisan spirit.",166
NA,"I commend the legislation to the House, and I salute the service of the men and women of",166
NA,our ADF who will be at the sharp end of implementing the consequences of this legislation. I,166
NA,wish them safe return.,166
Mr CREWTHER ,Dunkley) (18:30): I rise today to speak on the Criminal Code,166
NA,Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016. I particularly thank the Joint Committee on Intelligence,166
NA,"and Security, which is chaired by Michael Sukkar, for the wonderful work that he and the",166
NA,"committee have done on this legislation. We see around the world, in Australia and",166
NA,"internationally, an increased international threat of terrorism as well as terrorist acts and war",166
NA,"crimes. We have seen, in particular, recent terror attacks, whether it be in Canada, whether it",166
NA,"be in Syria or elsewhere. There is a continual threat to our security and our way of life, and it",166
NA,is pleasing to see the committee and the parliament continuing to work to protect us.,166
NA,"Indeed, we live in a more interconnected world, particularly with social media, with an",166
NA,increasing need for regional and international engagement. It is crucial that we work with our,166
NA,"international partners and key allies around the world, including the United States. Our",166
NA,activities in the way that our defence forces operate overseas have an international impact;,166
NA,they are not just of sole domestic relevance. As the Prime Minister said in his address this,166
NA,"morning, 'No one country can fight terrorism on its own.' It is more important than ever to",166
NA,make sure that the way our military operates is compatible with our allies.,166
NA,"In Australia we have a dualist approach to international law, which means that, in terms of",166
NA,"international treaties, we implement them at the domestic level as well to bring them into",166
NA,"force. This bill, at the domestic level, alters Australian law so that it is in line with",166
NA,"international law. Currently, the inconsistency leaves a gap between laws, which means that",166
NA,legal prosecution is possible when undertaking operational activities. This is something we,166
NA,wish to avoid when conducting legitimate operations. Critical to the protection of our ADF,166
NA,"personnel and decision-makers is this legislation, which aims to ensure that organised armed",166
NA,"groups such as Daesh, otherwise known as ISIL, who are becoming a greater threat than even",166
NA,"some conventional military forces, can be legitimately targeted.",166
NA,I am very pleased to have with me this week a member of the Defence Force Major Rob,166
NA,"Marlow, who has served in Iraq as well as other areas. He is doing a terrific job and is with",166
NA,NA,166
NA,"me this week as part of the parliamentary program, in which I recently had the opportunity to",167
NA,"go to Iraq and Syria, in the air, in a refuelling operation, as well as to Afghanistan on the",167
NA,"ground and the UAE, to our bases.",167
NA,We cannot keep operating on an outdated understanding of conflict with traditional armed,167
NA,"force structures operating simply within the bounds of the traditional notion of states,",167
NA,"particularly with groups like Daesh, which operates across traditional state borders.",167
NA,"Otherwise, we will be constantly playing catch-up in a legislative sense. This, therefore,",167
NA,cripples our defence forces due to an inaccurate perspective of the nature of conflict.,167
NA,"Going to the substance of this bill, it will ensure that the changing nature of conflict does",167
NA,not escape our legislative definitions. Prior legislation left our Defence Force and our Defence,167
NA,"personnel in a legal grey area, which was restrained by our domestic Criminal Code. This bill",167
NA,goes to the crux of the matter by amending the Criminal Code Act 1995. It makes the,167
NA,distinction in domestic laws between civilians and organised armed groups. This is a,167
NA,distinction which already exists in international law. It applies in the context of non-,167
NA,"international armed conflicts as well as regular armed conflicts-that is, a conflict that",167
NA,"involves one or more non-state organised armed groups. It is, indeed, a thing of recent times",167
NA,not to be simply facing a state or state-sponsored enemy. An organised group by definition is,167
NA,one which at least has a minimal degree of organisation. It has some kind of command,167
NA,structure or hierarchy. Its existence forms part of a collective purpose that is related to the,167
NA,broader hostilities and involves the use of force to achieve its purposes. It also incorporates a,167
NA,sufficient connection to non-international conflicts and can exist within a larger entity.,167
NA,To make sure that a person cannot be charged with domestic law offences in the incident of,167
NA,"a death of or an attack on a member of an organised armed group, even if they are not taking a",167
NA,"direct part in the hostilities, is a key aspect of this bill. With Daesh, we see an ideological",167
NA,"threat to us, our allies and those civilians and others within the countries in which Daesh",167
NA,operates. It is key not only to combat those who are targeting people on the ground in terms of,167
NA,"combatants but also to those members of the organisations who might, for example, form the",167
NA,"administrative wing and assist those fighters on the ground, who may not be technically",167
NA,"fighting but are enabling the conflict aspects of the organised armed groups-for example, the",167
NA,"training of suicide bombers, those recruiting fighters, those involved in propaganda or",167
NA,"logistics, those who manage social media propaganda, where we have seen Daesh be",167
NA,"particularly active on Twitter and other platforms, or those in weapons and ammunition",167
NA,transfer or production.,167
NA,The second important aspect of this bill is the protection of civilians. The bill aligns,167
NA,Australian domestic law with the approach and view of international law when viewed in the,167
NA,context of the international humanitarian principle of proportionality. The principle of,167
NA,"proportionality, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, is:",167
NA,"Launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to",167
NA,"civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to",167
NA,the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated is prohibited.,167
NA,As Minister Dutton noted in his speech with respect to this bill:,167
NA,The principle prohibits attacks which are expected to cause incidental loss of life or injury to,167
NA,civilians that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.,167
NA,NA,167
NA,"So this bill does not reduce protections for civilians, and it is definitely important to note that.",168
NA,"The amendments to distinguish civilians from organised armed groups, under Australian",168
NA,"domestic law, are an important aspect of this bill. Existing protections for civilians remain the",168
NA,"same, including for medical people, religious people and those not involved in combat. It",168
NA,"maintains prohibitions against deliberate targeting of civilians, and this is a fundamental",168
NA,principle of international humanitarian law.,168
NA,"The amendments reflect international humanitarian law stating that civilian death or injury,",168
NA,"within the principle of proportionality, do not incur charges of war crimes, including of",168
NA,"murder. To reiterate the concept of proportionality regarding civilians, the bill actually",168
NA,"concerns where civilian deaths or injury are the result of an attack on a military objective,",168
NA,launched in circumstances where the decision-makers and personnel did not reasonably,168
NA,expect the attack would cause incidental civilian death or injury that is excessive in relation to,168
NA,the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. This is part of the aspect in terms of,168
NA,protection of civilians.,168
NA,Having previously worked in Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia as an international lawyer,168
NA,"on property rights to do with people who lost possession of their property due to the war, I",168
NA,"saw the direct impact of war crimes, as well as crimes against civilians, and the impact of",168
NA,"breaches to international humanitarian law. It is definitely important, particularly in the",168
NA,"aftermath of conflict, to ensure that laws enable the targeting of combatants while protecting",168
NA,civilians and ensuring proportionality.,168
NA,This bill will ensure minimal impact on genuine civilians. It is about ensuring protections,168
NA,"do not apply to members of organised armed groups, while at the same time ensuring the",168
NA,adequate protection of civilians. It amends division 268 to provide express recognition of the,168
NA,distinction between civilians and organised armed groups. It is legally relevant and,168
NA,compatible with human rights and freedoms that are recognised and declared in the,168
NA,international instruments listed in section 3 of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act,168
NA,2011.,168
NA,The bill ensures that Australia is endorsing and codifying at the domestic level the position,168
NA,"of international humanitarian law on the subject of conflict and proportionality, ensuring that",168
NA,"we can target both state combatants, as well as armed groups and non-state actors, including",168
NA,Daesh.,168
NA,"Realistically, this bill will ensure that our combatants on the ground, including those such",168
NA,"as Major Rob Marlow, who is with me this week, can operate while ensuring that they are in",168
NA,compliance with both international and domestic law. So they can directly combat the forces,168
NA,"of Daesh and combatants on the ground, while at the same time protecting civilians. It is in",168
NA,"exceptional circumstances, of course, that Australia will owe human rights obligations beyond",168
NA,"its territory, particularly when this bill operates extraterritorially.",168
NA,"I personally would like to thank the committee again for their wonderful work on this bill,",168
NA,particularly the work of Mr Michael Sukkar as well as Minister Dutton and others who have,168
NA,had a say directly in the implementation of this bill. I look forward to it passing the chamber,168
NA,so that it will ensure our ADF personnel can operate in the field of armed conflict and ensure,168
NA,"that they are safe and protected in doing so, whether it is Major Rob Marlow or the many",168
NA,other ADF personnel. I look forward to this bill passing the House and to the implementation,168
NA,NA,168
NA,"of this bill in domestic law, ensuring that we are in compliance with our international",169
NA,obligations.,169
NA,NA,169
NA,Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016. I would particularly like to commend the,169
NA,"contribution by the member for Eden-Monaro, and also the member for Isaacs. The member",169
NA,"for Eden-Monaro is not only on the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which has",169
NA,"looked at this piece of legislation, but, from his previous life in the ADF as a colonel, is an",169
NA,internationally recognised expert on international humanitarian law. He has been in conflict,169
NA,zones and has had to make and advise on rules of engagement. When the member for Eden-,169
NA,Monaro speaks on this topic he is heard around the world by people who respect his analysis.,169
NA,I thank them for their contributions. I also point out that there is obviously a bipartisan,169
NA,"approach to this piece of legislation, as is so often the case when it comes to defence matters.",169
NA,"It is the role of parliament to make sure that all of our federal laws are fit for purpose, that",169
NA,"they address the mischief intended to be addressed, and that there are no unintended",169
NA,consequences when it comes to legislation passed by the Commonwealth parliament. This bill,169
NA,addresses an anomaly in the war crimes offences so that it will target only the mischief,169
NA,"intended and cures a potential unintended consequence. Sadly, the current law has not kept up",169
NA,"with the nature of global conflicts. Sadly, our Defence personnel are engaged in a different set",169
NA,"of circumstances to those from 100 years ago, when people dug trenches and knew where the",169
NA,"enemy was. There is an area of law that deals with this. Like state law or industrial law, which",169
NA,"I used to practise in, there is, basically, law that deals with warfare or with international",169
NA,"humanitarian law. Obviously, a law that simultaneously permits and regulates the use of force",169
NA,"might sound bizarre to some people listening tonight, but military necessity and the principle",169
NA,of proportionality are designed to balance the existence of armed hostilities with consideration,169
NA,of humanity.,169
NA,The Red Cross does a lot of work in this area. It was formed out of conflict. Right when the,169
NA,"Red Cross was first formed, there was the realisation that people were dying after war for no",169
NA,good reason. Since then the Red Cross has done a lot of great work. I am one of the,169
NA,Parliamentary Friends of the Red Cross and I particularly point out the International,169
NA,"Humanitarian Law magazine put out by the Australian Red Cross. In particular, I recommend",169
NA,'Pen and Sword: Journalism and International Humanitarian Law' to the journalists in,169
NA,Parliament House. It raises some interesting questions.,169
NA,International humanitarian law distinguishes between conflict between the armed forces of,169
NA,states-you might almost say traditional warfare-and conflicts in which one or more of the,169
NA,combatants are non-governmental. It also distinguishes between organised armed groups and,169
NA,civilians. This bill will ensure that Australia's domestic criminal laws with respect to war,169
NA,crimes are in line with the requirements of international humanitarian law. Our Defence,169
NA,personnel have been restricted in their operations overseas against non-government groups,169
NA,"such as Daesh. Australia's allies, operating under international humanitarian law, have been",169
NA,able to operate freely against these Daesh targets. This bill before the chamber will address,169
NA,this anomaly by excluding from our domestic war crimes legislation criminal liability when,169
NA,organised armed groups are targeted by our Defence Force. It will ensure that organised,169
NA,armed groups do not benefit from the protections that are actually afforded to civilians. This,169
NA,will bring our domestic war crimes legislation in line with international humanitarian law,169
NA,NA,169
NA,derived from the Geneva Conventions and the Protocols Additional to the Geneva,170
NA,Conventions.,170
NA,"Could I particularly mention a former Labor minister, Robert Tickner, who is, I understand,",170
NA,"in Geneva at the moment doing great work for the Red Cross. Obviously, the Red Cross is",170
NA,always neutral and has always received bipartisan support in this parliament.,170
NA,The legislation before the House has reasonable objectives to ensure that our Defence,170
NA,"personnel are protected. We are very lucky in this country. For most of us, if we see an Army",170
NA,"vehicle driving down our streets, we are proud. If we see a RAAF plane, we are proud. If we",170
NA,"see a naval vessel in our day-to-day lives, we are proud to see that. Our ADF makes us proud,",170
NA,not nervous. That is not the case in all other 200 countries around the world.,170
NA,"Deputy Speaker Buchholz, I particularly mention my hometown of St George-because I",170
NA,know of your connection with it-where ADFA recently undertook some graduate training,170
NA,that was like a hostage situation. I was talking to some friends from St George that were,170
NA,"staying with me last week, and they said it was the best thing for the town. It was incredible;",170
NA,"all these Army vehicles, and people had to play terrorists and victims. It was a great boost for",170
NA,"the town's economy. Hopefully, ADF will recruit some personnel out of St George in the next",170
NA,"little while, because the people were very impressed with the young men and women of",170
NA,ADFA-who are some of our nation's brightest-and the way they carried themselves in my,170
NA,"hometown. Well done to those ADFA people, who I think will be graduating soon.",170
NA,"When we see our ADF personnel, our reaction is that we are proud of them. We always are,",170
NA,and I say hello to those people from our Defence Force that are in parliament this week as part,170
NA,"of the parliamentary placement program. Hopefully, they are still keen to be associated with",170
NA,"the parliament after seeing it up close. I think, sometimes when you see democracy up close,",170
NA,"it might be like watching how to make a sausage. It might be tasty, but you do not want to",170
NA,"look too closely at it, and I say that as the son of a butcher.",170
NA,"Nevertheless, we must remember the important and dangerous work that our ADF",170
NA,personnel do both here and in far-flung corners of the world. We should never be complacent,170
NA,about their service and never be complacent about our Defence Force. We need to look after,170
NA,"them while they are serving, and I would also like to mention the legal officers that do much",170
NA,of that work. I have had some connections with them on the encouragement of the member,170
NA,"for Eden-Monaro, who pointed out the great work that they do. It is a way to keep a lawyer's",170
NA,shingle ticking over. But part of modern warfare is to be able to understand the laws of,170
NA,"engagement. It is not like 100 years ago on the Somme, when you were in a trench and you",170
NA,"knew where the enemy was. Now, you might be making life and death decisions about",170
NA,something while sitting in Kansas looking at an image provided by a drone. You might be,170
NA,"making decisions about civilians or making decisions about people that are not state entities,",170
NA,"rather, they are groups that are using human shields. They are very difficult legal decisions,",170
NA,and legal advice needs to be given to the commanding officers. The modern commanding,170
NA,officer would have a very close relationship with their legal officer.,170
NA,We need to look after them when they are serving and make sure they get the right,170
NA,"equipment, the right advice and the right training. But also, we need to look after our service",170
NA,personnel when they return to our shores. I mention our Returned Services League and those,170
NA,"other veterans' groups, like Soldier On, Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Association and many",170
NA,others that do a wonderful job of supporting both current and ex-serving members of the,170
NA,NA,170
NA,"Australian Defence Force and their families. In my electorate of Moreton, there are five RSL",171
NA,"clubs: Sherwood/Indooroopilly, Salisbury, Stephens, Sunnybank and Yeronga/Dutton Park.",171
NA,"They are all doing great work. I have spent quite a bit of time with these clubs over the years,",171
NA,as a member of parliament. I worked closely with them for the commemoration of the 100th,171
NA,"anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. The RSL, as we all know, has a very proud tradition. It",171
NA,"is one of our oldest national organisations, founded in 1916, so it is in its second 100 years of",171
NA,service to the people of Australia. As well as supporting and serving our ex-service men and,171
NA,"women, the RSL promotes a secure, stable and progressive Australia. We are indebted to it",171
NA,for the services that it provides.,171
NA,"The orientation of Parliament House is towards the War Memorial, no doubt so that all",171
NA,members of parliament and senators are aware of the sacrifice of those that have come before.,171
NA,Two weeks ago we commemorated Remembrance Day in Moreton and around Australia. On,171
NA,11 November 1918 the guns of the Western Front fell silent after more than four years of,171
NA,horrific continuous warfare. It is an important day when Australians of all races and creeds,171
NA,"remember those who gave their lives for freedom-that horrible sacrifice of 60,000",171
NA,"Australian soldiers-and then the damage done after that war to numerous people, too many",171
NA,"to count: people who did return, perhaps having lost limbs; the many families who lost family",171
NA,members; and the families of people who returned as well. There was horrific suffering.,171
NA,I also attended a very special ceremony here at Parliament House with the Minister for,171
NA,"Veterans' Affairs, where we commemorated not those who died in battle but those who died",171
NA,after returning. It was a very moving ceremony. I am sure the minister would agree. It was,171
NA,"quite moving to place a poppy in a cross to commemorate those who took their own lives,",171
NA,"sadly, upon returning. I know the minister is doing some good work in that area to look after",171
NA,those who return.,171
NA,Modern warfare takes its toll on our defence personnel not only physically but also,171
NA,"emotionally and psychologically. As I said, a decision might be made thousands of miles from",171
NA,"where someone might die, but it still will take a toll on our ADF personnel and contractors",171
NA,and all sorts of people associated with modern warfare. Some returning service men and,171
NA,"women, sadly, never recover, and some find it impossible to go on. We remembered, at the",171
NA,"ceremony here in Parliament House, those men and women who could not find the will to go",171
NA,"on, who were tormented by the horrors that they had seen fighting for our freedom, for our",171
NA,Australian way of life. It is important to do all we can to protect the men and women of,171
NA,"Australia's defence forces, both while they are fighting abroad and when they return. This bill",171
NA,"will help protect our brave men and women who are fighting abroad on our behalf, in",171
NA,conflicts that sometimes have no boundaries and against an enemy who is difficult to identify,171
NA,"and, sadly, will do anything and will not respect international humanitarian law. I thank our",171
NA,ADF personnel for their service and commend this legislation to the House.,171
Ms BRODTMANN ,Canberra) (18:55): We are witnessing a rapid transformation in the,171
NA,"nature of armed conflict. The world looks very different to how it looked in 2002, when the",171
NA,existing Criminal Code provisions were enacted. We see it today in the rise of organised,171
NA,armed groups such as ISIS and the way these groups engage in non-international armed,171
NA,"conflict. The world looks very different, and so do the laws that govern it. So it is appropriate",171
NA,that Australian law is updated in accordance with updates to international law.,171
NA,NA,171
NA,The Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016 amends division 268 of the,172
NA,Criminal Code Act 1995 to align Australian domestic law with international laws governing,172
NA,the treatment of members of organised armed groups who participate in non-international,172
NA,armed conflicts. The bill recognises the distinction between a civilian and a member of an,172
NA,organised armed group. Members of an organised armed group do not benefit from the,172
NA,protections under international humanitarian law afforded to civilians or medical and religious,172
NA,personnel. These amendments today ensure that members of organised armed groups receive,172
NA,treatment equivalent to members of regular armed forces under the law.,172
NA,These amendments are a reflection of what we have seen and experienced as a community,172
NA,"since 2002, and there have been massive changes. We know we are in a different time, and",172
NA,this should be reflected in law. This distinction already exists in international humanitarian,172
NA,law. We should remove all doubt that it also exists in Australian domestic law. These,172
NA,amendments are not proposed with only current conflicts in mind. This is about setting a,172
NA,principal piece of legislation with which to go forward.,172
NA,"Of course, as with any legislation, it should reflect the time. When circumstances change,",172
NA,"as always, so too should Australia's legal environment. And we should expect them to change,",172
NA,for the participants in conflict shape the nature of the conflict. We are seeing today armies at,172
NA,"war with civilians and with civilisation. With ISIS, we have a flag in search of a nation. Its",172
NA,ambitions are destruction. Its enemies are modernity. Its weapons are anything and,172
NA,everything.,172
NA,"But there is a third front in ISIS's war, and it is one that does not get quite so much",172
NA,"attention. Its fight is against the West and its fight is against the Muslim world, but its third",172
NA,fight is against female empowerment and all that it allows. Its fight is against women's access,172
NA,"to education, women's freedom of association, women's freedom of religion, women's",172
NA,"freedom of movement, women's freedom of speech-women's freedom. Its war is against",172
NA,"women, and, in this war too, every weapon is fair game.",172
NA,The 2015 ISIS manifesto 'Women in the Islamic State: Manifesto and Case Study' advises,172
NA,that the role of women is to 'remain hidden and veiled'. The manifesto declares that 'women,172
NA,gain nothing from the idea of their equality with men apart from thorns' and that they should,172
NA,focus on their 'divine duty of motherhood'. The same manifesto states that it is 'legitimate for,172
NA,a girl to be married at the age of nine' and that women should not get degrees. According to,172
NA,"ISIS, women should only leave their homes in 'exceptional circumstances', such as",172
NA,committing jihad.,172
NA,"The United Nations estimates that ISIS has forced some 1,500 women, teenaged girls and",172
NA,boys into sexual slavery-these are old figures; I hate to think what sort of figures we are,172
NA,"looking at now-but anecdotal evidence suggests that the true figure is far, far greater. The",172
NA,UN envoy on sexual violence in conflict found that girls from Iraq and Syria were made to,172
NA,"engage in the most unspeakable acts of sexual violence. ISIS's justification for these acts, as",172
NA,"outlined in its pamphlet-yes, that is right: a pamphlet-on female captives and slaves is that",172
NA,'it is permissible to capture' and 'to have sexual intercourse' with 'unbelieving women'. Once,172
NA,"captured, these unbelieving women can be bought and they can be sold, as-and I am quoting",172
NA,"here from the pamphlet on female captives and slaves-'they are merely property, which can",172
NA,be disposed of.',172
NA,NA,172
NA,One so called 'unbelieving woman' is Nadia Murad. Nadia was 19 when her Yazidi village,173
NA,"in Northern Iraq was captured by ISIS. Nadia watched, alongside her mother and sisters, as",173
NA,the men in the village-including her brothers-were brutally slaughtered. For the next eight,173
NA,"months, Nadia was abused and she was raped by ISIS troops. She was held in captivity by 13",173
NA,"different 'owners'. Nadia, 19 years old, from a Yazidi village in Northern Iraq was held in",173
NA,captivity by 13 different 'owners'.,173
NA,"Nadia is a reminder of why it is important that we note this third front, the impact on",173
NA,women-and not because it is a new one. The Book of Lamentations recounts that: 'Women,173
NA,"have been ravished in Zion, and virgins in the towns of Judah.' During the 15th and 16th",173
NA,"centuries, throughout much of the world, the right to commit acts of sexual violence against",173
NA,the objects of one's conquest was considered a form of earned compensation.,173
NA,The Second World War showed us a level of human tragedy that we have never seen. It,173
NA,"was in this context that the character of sexual violence in conflict was altered, because it",173
NA,"became mechanised then. To use one example, it is estimated that the Soviet army raped",173
NA,anywhere between one million and two million women in Eastern Europe and Germany,173
NA,"during one year, 1945. So: the Soviet army raped one million to two million women in",173
NA,"Eastern Europe and Germany during 1945; in one year, one army, one million women.",173
NA,"In the Bosnian War, rape was an official order. Rape camps were deliberately established.",173
NA,The reported aim of these camps was to impregnate the Muslim and Croatian women held,173
NA,"captive. This occurred in the context of a patrilineal society, in which children inherit their",173
NA,"father's ethnicity; hence, the 'rape camps' aimed at the birth of a new generation of Serb",173
NA,children. It was a tool of ethnic cleansing. It was a mode of genocide-and I use that word,173
NA,"carefully, because, if what we are seeing today in Iraq and Syria constitutes genocide, we",173
NA,"should call it out for what it is. It is a form of crime with a long history, and it is one that",173
NA,needs a new form of response. I propose that we prosecute the perpetrators.,173
NA,This Friday marks the beginning of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence. It,173
NA,"will also be the launch of the 'Prosecute, don't perpetrate' campaign, which calls for an end to",173
NA,the impunity currently enjoyed by those who commit acts of sexual violence in the theatre of,173
NA,"armed conflict. The 'Prosecute, don't perpetrate' campaign calls for the investigation and",173
NA,prosecution of sexual violence committed by Australians who have travelled to Iraq and Syria,173
NA,to fight with Daesh.,173
NA,We know that Daesh has used sexual violence as a tactic of war. Sexual violence is a war,173
NA,"crime, and we should treat it as such. The occurrence of systematic rape is well documented",173
NA,in Iraq and Syria. It is a crime against humanity; it is a crime against women; and we should,173
NA,treat it as such. The United Nations Human Rights Council has published reports of Daesh's,173
NA,"intentions to impose: 'measures to prevent Yazidi children from being born'. This is genocide,",173
NA,and we should treat it as such. By some accounts-and we have heard quite a bit about it this,173
NA,week-over 100 Australians have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with Daesh and other,173
NA,extremist groups. We need to investigate and prosecute the sexual violence they have,173
NA,"perpetrated as war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, for these are all crimes",173
NA,under Australian domestic legislation.,173
NA,We also need to remind ourselves that sexual violence in conflict is not inevitable. I think,173
NA,that everyone just thinks that this is basically the by-product of war-the raping of women;,173
NA,"the raping of small girls; the raping of small boys-and just thinks, 'Oh, gee; that's bad, but",173
NA,NA,173
NA,this is just a by-product of war.' We saw it with the Second World War. We saw it in Bosnia.,174
NA,"It is not simply a sad consequence of war. It is how war is now being fought, and ISIS is using",174
NA,"sexual violence as a weapon of war-as an orchestrated, coordinated, industrialised tactic of",174
NA,"terror. It is a horrifying evolution of an age-old practice, and it is now the means to a very",174
NA,different end. And its use is a crime we cannot excuse.,174
NA,I want to conclude by thanking a range of women who have been very active in this space,174
NA,"for a very long time, who are still maintaining the rage and who are behind this campaign to",174
NA,"prosecute, not perpetrate. I have met most of these women since I have been in the shadow",174
NA,Defence portfolio over the last four years. I have met most of them through the Australian,174
NA,"Strategic Policy Institute, which has a number of seminars on women, peace and security and",174
NA,the range of UN resolutions that have emerged in this area.,174
NA,It is very important that we keep discussing this issue and that we do not just sweep it,174
NA,"under the carpet. It is important that we keep maintaining the rage about this issue, because it",174
NA,"is not something that is going to go away by our basically just saying, 'Oh, sorry, but that is",174
NA,just a by-product of war; we're just going to have to put up with it.' It is unacceptable. As I,174
NA,said: women are being raped-and not just raped; enslaved. Nadia had-what was it?-13,174
NA,"'owners'. Small children-small girls and boys-are being raped and held as sex slaves, with",174
NA,13 owners plus. It is unacceptable. It is brutal. It is hard to imagine the lives that these women,174
NA,"are enduring under this hideous, monstrous existence.",174
NA,I want to do a call-out to a number of people who have been very active in keeping this,174
NA,issue on the agenda and reminding us as leaders and as a community that we cannot take our,174
NA,"eye off this issue. We do need to maintain our attention on this issue. I want to, first of all,",174
NA,thank Peter Jennings and his team at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute for having,174
NA,regular seminars on this issue. I was at a panel discussion probably a month ago where we had,174
NA,a woman who had just been involved in representing Australia on the UN 1325 and other,174
NA,"resolutions. We also had Brad Orchard, from the Department of Defence, who is actually",174
NA,implementing the UN 1325 and other resolutions from the defence perspective.,174
NA,"We also had the wonderful Jennifer Wittwer, who is going to be our new representative in",174
NA,"the UN, hopefully shortly. I understand she has had a bit of a bad bout with health but has",174
NA,"recently got the all-clear. So she will, I hope, be winging her way to New York to be a",174
NA,fantastic representative for Australia in the very near future. I also want to thank Lisa,174
NA,"Sharland, who has been very, very active in this space for a long time. She is probably one of",174
NA,"Australia's leading experts on women, peace and security. She has worked on this issue in",174
NA,"Africa, the United States, Europe and Asia. She is one of our leading experts here in",174
NA,"Australia. Again, I want to thank her for educating me on this issue and constantly bringing to",174
NA,my attention the fact that we need to maintain the rage.,174
NA,I also want to thank Susan Hutchinson for her continuing campaigning on this most crucial,174
NA,issue. I spoke about this issue yesterday and it was wonderful to have Susan in the gallery,174
NA,"listening to the speech. She is an expert on women, peace and security and she has",174
NA,"championed this issue with energy and dedication. She recognises, as I do, that asking for",174
NA,"existing laws to be enforced should not be a controversial demand, should not really be much",174
NA,"of a big ask. She recognises, as I do, that we should never excuse or tolerate incidents of",174
NA,"sexual violence in armed conflict. She recognises, as I do, that we have the power to provide",174
NA,justice to the victims of these heinous crimes.,174
NA,NA,174
NA,War crimes are criminalised in the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the War Crimes Act,175
NA,1945. Genocide and crimes against humanity are outlawed in the International Criminal Court,175
NA,"Act 2002. These laws need to be implemented. International law matters, and these laws need",175
NA,to be implemented. That is why we propose to amend the Criminal Code to better reflect it.,175
NA,"We seek to harmonise international humanitarian law with Australian domestic law, because",175
NA,we recognise that the challenge we share is a common one.,175
Mr KEENAN ,Stirling-Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister,175
NA,for Counter-Terrorism) (19:10): I thank all members who have participated in this debate on,175
NA,the Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016. National security does deserve a,175
NA,"bipartisan approach from this parliament. To date, this parliament has provided that approach",175
NA,"and I think it is a good reflection on the fact that, in this vitally important policy area, we can",175
NA,work together to make sure that Australia is as safe as we can possibly make it.,175
NA,Passage of the Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes) Bill 2016 will ensure that the,175
NA,"Australian Defence Force can conduct targeted operations against organised armed groups,",175
NA,"such as the military arm of Daesh, to the extent permitted by international humanitarian law.",175
NA,These amendments also provide important legal certainty for ADF personnel in undertaking,175
NA,those operations. As the Prime Minister outlined in the House today in his address to,175
NA,"parliament on national security and counterterrorism, this bill is part of a suite of actions taken",175
NA,by the government to empower our agencies and our defence forces to keep us safe. The bill,175
NA,has been subjected to careful scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence,175
NA,"and Security, which concluded that the amendments would provide appropriate protection for",175
NA,"civilians, while maintaining the capacity to conduct operations against legitimate military",175
NA,targets.,175
NA,"I did not have the opportunity to listen to every contributor to this debate, although I did",175
NA,catch a lot of what the member for Canberra said. She reminded us about the barbarity of the,175
NA,"enemy that we are facing and the sexual violence, the enslavement of women and men-",175
NA,imagine an organisation that has been brought back slavery on an industrial scale-and the,175
NA,"crucifixions. I had a very productive meeting with the King of Jordan this afternoon and,",175
NA,"during that meeting, I learnt that one of his pilots was put in a cage and burnt alive, and that",175
NA,that was then used as propaganda in the course of the Islamic State. They throw homosexuals,175
NA,from roofs if they are discovered. What they inflict on the populations that have been under,175
NA,their control is an affront to basic human decency.,175
NA,We should be very proud of the fact that the Australian Defence Force is out there targeting,175
NA,"them, killing them and ultimately defeating them. These are people who are pure evil. I do not",175
NA,say that in any hyperboles way; look at their actions. We do need to call it out for what it is,175
NA,and we should all join together to support the work that the ADF is doing. This bill makes,175
NA,"sure that the ADF are not subject to any legal ramifications as a result of their very deliberate,",175
NA,targeted and effective actions in defeating this barbaric enemy.,175
NA,"I thank the House for the support that this bill has been given, and I appreciate that the",175
NA,House can come together to assist the passage of important amendments such as these.,175

NA,Civil Nuclear Transfers to India Bill 2016,176
NA,Second Reading,176
NA,Consideration resumed of the motion:,176
NA,That this bill be now read a second time.,176
Mr MARLES ,"Corio) (19:14): I rise this evening to speak in favour of and, in the process,",176
NA,to indicate Labor's support for the Civil Nuclear Transfers to India Bill 2016. Labor supports,176
NA,"peaceful nuclear cooperation with India, which includes the exportation of uranium to India",176
NA,"subject to a range of strong safeguards, many of which were assisted, facilitated and, indeed,",176
NA,negotiated by the previous Labor government with the government of India. What this bill,176
NA,will in essence do is provide certainty for the Australian export of uranium to India in the,176
NA,"context of our law. That is important because, in turn, it will provide certainty to exporters",176
NA,"here in Australia, which will assist in creating Australian jobs; it will provide a benefit to",176
NA,"India, which desperately needs the development of a civil nuclear industry, and our uranium",176
NA,will help support that; and it will also assist in the development and increasing development,176
NA,of Australian-Indian bilateral relations.,176
NA,"At the outset, I want to make it clear that Labor takes a principled approach when it comes",176
NA,to issues regarding the export of uranium. Labor has a history of leadership on nuclear,176
NA,nonproliferation and disarmament. We absolutely and passionately believe in prohibiting and,176
NA,"eliminating nuclear weapons as a humanitarian imperative, and we therefore have always",176
NA,taken a judicious and prudent approach to both the mining and the exportation of uranium,176
NA,"from Australia. Most importantly, we support the export of uranium to India only under the",176
NA,"most stringent of conditions, which ensure that Australian uranium: can only be used for",176
NA,"civilian purposes in India; cannot, therefore, be diverted for military uses; can never be used",176
NA,"in the development of nuclear weapons; and does not contribute, therefore, in any way to the",176
NA,proliferation of nuclear weapons.,176
NA,"Recognising that these safeguards and protections exist, and noting that our bilateral",176
NA,"cooperation with India is beneficial to both nations, Labor is supporting this bill. In doing so,",176
NA,NA,176
NA,Labor recognises the government's urgency in the passage of this bill-acknowledging that,177
NA,"there are Australian suppliers close to finalising initial contracts for supply to India, and India,",177
NA,having already worked for over 10 years with the Nuclear Suppliers Group to demonstrate,177
NA,"sufficient credentials in this area, is prepared to begin importing uranium from Australia. As I",177
NA,"have said, we also acknowledge the need to provide Australian businesses and exporters with",177
NA,"certainty. While there is now an urgent need to pass this bill, in our view, this could have been",177
NA,avoided with better planning. It is unfortunate that the government failed to handle this bill in,177
NA,"a more timely manner. In the September 2015 JSCOT report, Report 151, the committee",177
NA,"clearly recommended, in recommendation 5, that the government:",177
NA,… outline the legal advice it has received concerning whether the proposed Agreement between the,177
NA,Government of Australia and the Government of India on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear,177
NA,Energy breaches Australia's obligations under the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty.,177
NA,"The government has, with more than a year's time, failed to provide this legal advice and it is",177
NA,"unfortunate. Australia's international treaty obligations deserve careful consideration, and the",177
NA,government ought to have provided this advice in a timely manner.,177
NA,"That said, Australia recognises India's strong nonproliferation record, and we acknowledge",177
NA,"the separation that exists within India's civil and military nuclear industries. As I have said,",177
NA,India has worked for more than 10 years with the Nuclear Suppliers Group to demonstrate its,177
NA,credentials in this area. India has diligently pursued its credentials as a responsible nuclear,177
NA,"nation, and its work within the global nonproliferation and safeguards system has contributed",177
NA,to its shift towards greater regional and global leadership. Australia's agreement to supply,177
NA,uranium to India has been negotiated with due caution and is supported by appropriate,177
NA,international agreements and strong safeguards. The safeguards in place which apply to,177
NA,Australia's supply of uranium to India are conditions set out by the Nuclear Suppliers Group,177
NA,"framework, the International Atomic Energy Agency framework and the Australia-India",177
NA,agreement on civil nuclear cooperation.,177
NA,Nuclear Suppliers Group is a group of nuclear supplier countries that seeks to contribute to,177
NA,"the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, of which Australia is a member. In 2008, the NSG",177
NA,"declared that, due to sufficient commitment and action taken by India in support of nuclear",177
NA,"nonproliferation, nuclear trade with India was permissible. The NSG framework also includes",177
NA,"safeguards and conditions, with IAEA safeguards being a condition of supply. Australian",177
NA,"exported nuclear material will exclusively remain in India's civil nuclear sector, to which the",177
NA,IAEA applies strong safeguards and independent inspections. These safeguards are,177
NA,comparable to the safeguards that underpin Australia's other nuclear cooperation agreements.,177
NA,"India agrees, in relation to uranium imports under the IAEA conditions, that:",177
NA,… no such item is used for the manufacture of any nuclear weapon or to further any other military,177
NA,purpose and that such items are used exclusively for peaceful purposes and not for the manufacture of,177
NA,any nuclear explosive device.,177
NA,"Through the Australia-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, India and Australia agree that",177
NA,the:,177
NA,… use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes should be consistent with the objectives of non-,177
NA,proliferation of nuclear weapons and with the respective international obligations of states;,177
NA,"Following the NSG's 2008 decision to permit nuclear trade with India, many countries",177
NA,"including the US, Canada, France, Japan and Korea established nuclear cooperation with",177
NA,NA,177
NA,"India. Over 10 years ago, India's then Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, agreed in a joint",178
NA,"statement with US President George W Bush, which stated:",178
NA,India would reciprocally agree that it would be ready to assume the same responsibilities and practices,178
NA,and acquire the same benefits and advantages as other leading countries with advanced nuclear,178
NA,"technology, such as the United States.",178
NA,"At this time, Prime Minister Singh committed to the IAEA process of separating India's",178
NA,civilian and military nuclear facilities and programs. This process also included the step of,178
NA,"India voluntarily placing its civilian nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. More recently,",178
NA,"in January 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Barack Obama made a further",178
NA,"commitment to civil nuclear cooperation, including a commitment to US-built nuclear",178
NA,"reactors, which will contribute to India's energy security.",178
NA,Labor acknowledges the lengthy and intensive process that India committed to over a,178
NA,decade ago and has been diligently pursuing ever since. India's commitment to non-,178
NA,proliferation and disarmament is not just an advancement of our ability to engage in bilateral,178
NA,nuclear cooperation; it also benefits global progress on nuclear responsibility.,178
NA,This bill is consistent with the position taken by Labor when in government and the positon,178
NA,articulated in Labor's national party platform. Labor's national platform supports the export of,178
NA,"uranium only under the most stringent conditions and safeguards. Since 2011, the platform",178
NA,specifically allows for supply to India on the basis of our bilateral relations and key steps,178
NA,taken by India towards nuclear non-proliferation. The current Labor national platform states:,178
NA,"In relation to India, an important strategic partner for Australia, commitments and responsible actions in",178
NA,"support of nuclear non-proliferation, consistent with international guidelines on nuclear supply, will",178
NA,"provide an acceptable basis for peaceful nuclear cooperation, including the export of uranium, subject to",178
NA,the application of strong safeguards.,178
NA,"Labor in government began the process addressed in this bill. In 2008, as a member of the",178
NA,"NSG, Australia supported a decision to enable nuclear trade with India. In 2009, as a member of the board of governo",178
NA,"Since that visit, the governments of both Australia and India have taken steps to implement",178
NA,the commitment then made by former prime ministers Gillard and Singh.,178
NA,The way in which this bill operates is to make Australia's compliance with our international,178
NA,treaty obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the,178
NA,South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty clear by law. In terms of the Treaty on the Non-,178
NA,"Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it is understood that the obligations under the frameworks",178
NA,which I have just described in many respects equal and even go beyond what is required,178
NA,"under the NPT. In respect of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, there is an",178
NA,"argument, which this piece of legislation ultimately clarifies, to make sure that our export of",178
NA,uranium to India is compliant in law with that treaty. It is important to acknowledge that the,178
NA,"original intent of that treaty related to nuclear testing within the Pacific and, of course, what is",178
NA,being proposed here does nothing to undermine that. None of the other state parties to that,178
NA,treaty have raised any objection to the very public position that Australia has taken in relation,178
NA,"to its export of uranium to India and, in terms of what we do in respect of supporting India's",178
NA,"civil energy generation in a way that does not give rise to carbon emissions, there is obviously",178
NA,a climate change benefit that benefits those in the region.,178
NA,It is important to acknowledge the significance of the exportation of Australian uranium to,178
NA,India from the perspective of India. India's civil nuclear energy generation capacity is vitally,178
NA,NA,178
NA,needed by that country. In India today about 300 million people exist without access to,179
NA,electricity. There is an increasing dependence on imported energy resources to satisfy that,179
NA,rising demand. Its primary energy consumption more than doubled between 1990 and 2011. It,179
NA,"is the world's third-largest energy consumer and the third-largest CO2 emitter, and in that",179
NA,context nuclear generated energy is critical to its future.,179
NA,The passage of this bill will also provide significant benefits here in Australia. Whilst India,179
NA,"right now represents a modest market for Australian uranium in the short term, it does have",179
NA,very significant growth potential. India's Department of Atomic Energy is seeking to buy up,179
NA,"to 1,500 tonnes of uranium from Australia over the next five years. India currently has 22",179
NA,"operable reactors, with five under construction and another 20 planned within the next eight",179
NA,"to 10 years. As new reactors come online from the early 2020s, Australia could expect to",179
NA,"supply a significant part of the 2,000 tonnes annually that India will require. Obviously, as",179
NA,India continues its ambitious plans to grow to where it has 25 per cent of its power from,179
NA,"nuclear sources by 2050, our position in that export market is critically important.",179
NA,"Finally, there is also strategic benefit from increased cooperation with India. Australia and",179
NA,"India have shared a commitment to peace, prosperity and stability in our region. We share a",179
NA,commitment to rules-based order. Australia has a deep interest in not just strengthening the,179
NA,bilateral relationship with India but also supporting India's growing leadership role in our,179
NA,region. It is in our interest to encourage India's growing leadership in the Indian Ocean and,179
NA,"across the Indo-Pacific. In 2009, under the previous Labor government, the Australia-India",179
NA,bilateral relationship was elevated to strategic partnership level. We enjoy warm bilateral,179
NA,"relationships, including a broad trade and investment relationship and rich people-to-people",179
NA,links. Australia's defence and security ties with India have grown substantially over the past,179
NA,several years. An element of this cooperation is a senior officials level of dialogue between,179
NA,Australia and India on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. This type of bilateral,179
NA,exchange enhances the capacities of both our nations to contribute to the global advancement,179
NA,"of non-proliferation and disarmament. For all these reasons, Labor is happy to support this",179
NA,bill.,179
NA,Debate interrupted.,179
NA,ADJOURNMENT,179
NA,"The SPEAKER (19:30): It being exactly 7.30 pm, I propose the question:",179
NA,That the House do now adjourn.,179
NA,Climate Change,179
Ms ROWLAND ,Greenway) (19:30): Australia needs to step up when it comes to action,179
NA,on climate change. Donald Trump's recent election in the United States means that there is,179
NA,now increased uncertainty over the Paris climate change agreement. Even though the,179
NA,"president-elect now claims to have an open mind on the agreement, throughout his campaign",179
NA,"for the presidency, Mr Trump pledged to cancel it.",179
NA,"At the COP22 meeting held recently in Marrakech, it was announced that Fiji would be the",179
NA,president of the COP23 meeting in Germany next year. This is a significant achievement for,179
NA,"the Fijian government, and one on which I congratulate them sincerely. Hopefully, it will be a",179
NA,"defining moment for the debate around climate change. Fiji's Prime Minister, Frank",179
NA,"Bainimarama, whom I have had the honour of meeting on several occasions, used the",179
NA,NA,179
NA,appointment to appeal to President-elect Trump for a change of heart and policy on climate,180
NA,change. He said:,180
NA,"Sir, you have said that you do not believe that climate change is man-made … I am especially alarmed",180
NA,"by reports that you intend to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which would be disastrous for every",180
NA,person on earth. I appeal to you to show the leadership that the rest of the world expects the United,180
NA,States to take on this issue.,180
NA,Australia should support this show of policy leadership in this area from one of our largest,180
NA,Pacific neighbours. We also have a significant role to play in meeting our commitments in the,180
NA,"Paris Agreement. For our Pacific Island neighbour nations like Fiji, Kiribati and the Marshall",180
NA,"Islands, this is not only a debate about targets and technology; it is a debate about their very",180
NA,survival. These island nations are battling not only against rising sea levels but also against,180
NA,"more frequent and damaging storms and cyclones. Cyclone Winston, which hit Fiji earlier this",180
NA,"year, was the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, killing 44",180
NA,"people and leaving many homeless. In inviting President-elect Trump to visit his country,",180
NA,Prime Minister Bainimarama brought the consequences of climate change into sharp focus.,180
NA,He said:,180
NA,We will show you how we are already having to move entire communities out of the way of the rising,180
NA,seas and you can meet the families of the 44 Fijians who were killed last February.,180
NA,Australians are always generous in helping our neighbours when disaster hits. We were large,180
NA,"contributors to help Vanuatu recover from Cyclone Pam in 2015, the Philippines from",180
NA,"Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, and Fiji from Cyclone Winston earlier this year, but we should not",180
NA,just be worried when a disaster hits. We can take action to reduce our carbon footprint and,180
NA,"assist with mitigation efforts. For example, the IAG's recent report on natural disasters found",180
NA,that every dollar spent on natural disaster mitigation efforts can save at least $2 and help to,180
NA,"prevent future losses. The benefits of mitigation are often unseen and expensive, and often we",180
NA,do not fully appreciate them until they are actually needed. It can be a hard policy to,180
NA,"prosecute, but it is an absolutely necessary one because, while climate change impacts on all",180
NA,"communities, it particularly hurts those who already have the least.",180
NA,"Australia must do more to help our neighbours, and one of the ways we can do this is by",180
NA,"taking serious action on climate change. On that point, I was delighted this week to meet with",180
NA,representatives of Micah Australia from my local area. They are focused on Australia being a,180
NA,good neighbour in our region and helping developing countries who are increasingly being hit,180
NA,by more severe natural disasters. As Micah states: 'Beyond responding to emergencies when,180
NA,"they occur, it will be critical that the global community acts decisively to build communities",180
NA,that are resilient in the face of these disasters.',180
NA,"We on this side of the House completely agree, and we know that that is what the majority",180
NA,"of Australians want. Unfortunately, we have a government that is full of climate change",180
NA,deniers and a Prime Minister who is beholden to them. This is despite his once declaring that,180
NA,he would not lead a party that was not as committed as himself to tackling climate change.,180
NA,"Labor believe the science, and we understand the need for real action on climate. That is why",180
NA,"we took a comprehensive climate change and energy policy to the last election, including a",180
NA,plan to reduce pollution and increase renewables. If we are serious about meeting our,180
NA,"obligations under the Paris Agreement, then the government should strengthen their 2030",180
NA,NA,180
NA,"targets as well as implement real policies to reduce emissions, especially in the electricity",181
NA,sector.,181
NA,I and my colleagues on this side of the House will continue to support real action on,181
NA,climate change in this parliament. We stand with the overwhelming majority of nations that,181
NA,are now committed to reducing emissions and stopping the devastating impacts of climate,181
NA,change. Our Pacific island neighbours like Fiji should not only have Australia's help after,181
NA,"natural disaster hits to help them rebuild. We can, and should, do more to make sure their",181
NA,homelands are not washed away by the impacts of climate change.,181
NA,Youth Unemployment,181
Mr VASTA ,Bonner) (19:35): Tonight I rise to speak on a vital issue in my electorate-,181
NA,the issue of youth unemployment. I would like to address the effect of youth unemployment,181
NA,on the community and what this government is doing to help young people to find and stay in,181
NA,work. I would also like to mention a local organisation in Bonner that is doing a fantastic job,181
NA,with young locals to help boost their job prospects.,181
NA,I am pleased to say the latest figures show unemployment is continuing to fall and jobs,181
NA,"growth is on the rise under this coalition government. Over 50,000 more young Australians",181
NA,"have found jobs in the last 18 months, which is a great accomplishment. However, there is",181
NA,more to be done to address the barriers young people face to employment.,181
NA,I have heard many heartbreaking stories from young jobseekers and their parents about the,181
NA,"mental strain of searching for work for months on end, and I want to assure my constituents",181
NA,that the government is tackling this issue head on. This year the government expanded on its,181
NA,existing youth employment initiatives such as the Transition to Work service and,181
NA,Empowering YOUth Initiatives program by introducing the $840 million youth employment,181
NA,package. A central part of this package is the Youth Jobs PaTH (Prepare-Trial-Hire) program.,181
NA,Youth Jobs PaTH will give thousands of young Australians a chance to get real work,181
NA,"experience and a real job through pre-employment government-funded skills training,",181
NA,"internships lasting four to 12 weeks and a youth bonus wage subsidy of up to $10,000 for",181
NA,employers.,181
NA,This program will represent a great opportunity for local youth and local businesses when,181
NA,it launches in April 2017. It will help young people to be better prepared for the workplace,181
NA,and encourage more businesses to hire them. I have been happy to hear from local businesses,181
NA,"that are interested in Youth Jobs PaTH, and I encourage more businesses in my electorate to",181
NA,register online to participate and host an intern.,181
NA,I am proud that local businesses and groups in Bonner have already rallied to help,181
NA,disadvantaged youth find work. BABI Youth and Family Service is one outstanding local,181
NA,organisation that for years has been giving young people training and employment,181
NA,"opportunities. Recently, BABI's general manager, Michelle MCNamara, shared with me a",181
NA,promising new social enterprise project that will involve the whole community to help,181
NA,vulnerable and disadvantaged young people find work. The two-year program would see,181
NA,"BABI team up with local businesses and RTOs to deliver valuable counselling, training and",181
NA,work experience for young locals.,181
NA,"The program will address the barriers young people face getting into employment, from",181
NA,mental health issues to lack of transport. I am proud to support this project and I look forward,181
NA,NA,181
NA,to seeing it get off the ground. BABI has serviced the Bayside and Redlands area for over 30,182
NA,years. I commend them for their outstanding work and I wish them all the best in their future,182
NA,work helping young people where they need it most. The government will continue to support,182
NA,local youth employment programs like those run by BABI. I look forward to seeing Youth,182
NA,Jobs PaTH begin next year and seeing more positive employment outcomes for young people,182
NA,in my electorate.,182
NA,Holt Electorate: Sikh Community,182
Mr BYRNE ,Holt) (19:38): I was honoured last week to meet His Holiness Sant Baba,182
NA,Amar Singh Ji at the Gurdwara Sahib Nanaksar temple in Lynbrook for a very important,182
NA,discussion about community resource building for our region. His holiness is a world-,182
NA,"renowned figure who has worked with many political leaders, including former United",182
NA,"Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, on issues like poverty alleviation, educational",182
NA,development and religious projects around the world. He is truly an internationally significant,182
NA,figure within the Sikh community.,182
NA,"Baba Ji, realising the enormous liberating power of education, has opened up schools",182
NA,"throughout India and abroad, providing much-needed education to the needy. In 1988, Baba Ji",182
NA,"had the foresight to purchase a piece of land in Lynbrook. This is in 1988-a long, long time",182
NA,ago-and there was not a lot out there. He bought this piece of land to build a new Sikh,182
NA,"temple and to cater for the growing Sikh population in Victoria, which now totals",182
NA,"approximately 45,000 people. At the time that Baba Ji was travelling around the suburb of",182
NA,"Lynbrook it would have been, effectively, farmland, so it was great foresight by His Holiness",182
NA,and it took great vision to create that opportunity for the Sikh community to have the temple,182
NA,"there. And I am sure that over time, provided that governments of all persuasions provide",182
NA,"appropriate support, it will become an iconic community based facility.",182
NA,Sikhism is one of the world's largest formalised religions and it traces its origins to Guru,182
NA,Nanak who lived in India in the 15th century. Many of the world's Sikhs live in the Punjab,182
NA,"region; however, there are large communities in a lot of other countries, including Australia.",182
NA,The local Sikh community in my constituency is an amazing community. They are a very,182
NA,integrated community. They are a community that really does make a difference in my area.,182
NA,And they were a community that came to the forefront when we had issues of community,182
NA,"concern about community safety, which is now making the headlines in papers like the",182
NA,Herald Sun. But it was their direct face-to-face consultation and input that alerted me to the,182
NA,extent of the difficulties we are facing with community safety in our region-because of what,182
NA,"they told me, because of the Sikh community.",182
NA,They were the first community that organised a community safety forum with Victoria,182
NA,"Police, which allowed us to discuss this issue. This was during the federal election campaign,",182
NA,"so we are talking a long time before it really, in a manner of speaking, hit the broadsheets like",182
NA,the Herald Sun. So I would like to commend them for the work that they have done on behalf,182
NA,of the overall community.,182
NA,"After speaking with Baba Ji and committee members Manpal Singh, Raj Singh and",182
NA,"Kamalpreet Singh, I look forward to working in partnership with them and to obtaining the",182
NA,"approximately $1.2 million dollars in funding that is needed for a community kitchen, a",182
NA,"community bathroom, doors, lift, community area and car park to complete the temple.",182
NA,NA,182
NA,"But I think also what has occurred in the United Kingdom is that, when Tony Blair was",183
NA,"Prime Minister, Baba Ji spoke to him, and they obtained government funding to ensure that",183
NA,the school was actually built in the United Kingdom. What happened after that is that it is,183
NA,going to become one of the first Sikh universities in Europe. So this is the trajectory I think,183
NA,that this fantastic facility in Lynbrook can follow. The fact that his Holiness has actually spent,183
NA,"so much time coming down to Australia, motivating his community and talking to political",183
NA,"leaders, like myself, means that we can bring this project to fruition, on a collective basis not",183
NA,just on a singular basis.,183
NA,"It is an iconic temple which is yet to be completed, by importantly a school facility also.",183
NA,We have had a lot of discussion about multiculturalism and what it means. But I can tell you,183
NA,what I see with the Sikh community. I see a community that wants to create a facility,183
NA,"primarily for the rest of the community not just for the Sikh community. As I said, it is a",183
NA,community that was concerned and wanted to talk to me about their community safety before,183
NA,it became a very popular issue. But it is now a community that wants to build facilities so that,183
NA,they can feed the poor and the homeless. They have a situation where they will feed people on,183
NA,a consistent basis if they can get the centre up and running properly.,183
NA,"This is the story of Australia. It is a great story, and I will do what I can to assist the Sikh",183
NA,community to complete their mission and their journey on behalf of the community.,183
NA,Agriculture Industry,183
Mr BROAD ,"Mallee) (19:43): I want to talk a bit about agriculture, because it is",183
NA,something very dear to my heart and because it is also something that is very dear to the,183
NA,economic driver of my community. We have been instrumental-largely under the leadership,183
NA,"of Andrew Robb, who is sadly now no longer with us in the parliament and now under Steve",183
NA,"Ciobo, the current Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment-in developing market",183
NA,opportunities. Market opportunities are so important if we are going to drive prosperity.,183
NA,"We have delivered the free trade agreement with China, Japan and South Korea. I had the",183
NA,privilege of being in Tokyo and Beijing in the last couple of weeks and I can see the benefits,183
NA,of those agreements. We are working on a good outcome for water. What Minister Joyce is,183
NA,doing is trying to bring communities together and deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in a,183
NA,way that also ensures that there is prosperity for our farmers through access to water.,183
NA,We are building the freight links. We have recently committed $220 million to upgrade the,183
NA,Murray Basin Rail Project. That $220 million partners with $220 million from the state,183
NA,government to help us get our product to the port from where we grow it in the north of the,183
NA,state of Victoria.,183
NA,The fourth key element to driving prosperity is access to workers. I just want to touch on,183
NA,the backpacker tax for a little bit. We have a source of workers in our horticultural industry,183
NA,"that is made up of some backpackers; it is made up of some Pacific Island workers, it is made",183
NA,"up of some locals, it is made up of some contractors. It is important that we have a mix of",183
NA,"workers. Ultimately, a backpacker does not take a Australian job. If you get someone who is",183
NA,"going to work out in the field and actually pick the fruit and put it in a box, you now have a",183
NA,"product that is in a box that someone can market-someone can drive a truck, someone can",183
NA,"fix that truck, someone can work as an exporter, someone can be a marketer, a developer and",183
NA,NA,183
NA,"a grower of that product. Without the person that is going to pick the product, the whole",184
NA,system falls down.,184
NA,"I have looked at the backpacker tax issue through four key caveats, and I think these",184
NA,caveats remain fair and consistent. Thirty-two-and-a-half per cent tax fails the fairness test. It,184
NA,gets up to over 40 degrees. You cannot expect a person to be out picking fruit in over 40,184
NA,degrees and then giving a third of that money to the government. It just fails the fairness test.,184
NA,"Also, though, a foreign worker should pay at least as much tax as an Australian. Currently, a",184
NA,"backpacker is paying no tax. They take a tax out at 13 per cent, but they claim that back and",184
NA,get no tax. That does not pass the fairness test. So the argument that a backpacker should even,184
NA,"pay 10½ per cent tax, which is what the Labor Party are putting forward with the amendments",184
NA,"from Jacqui Lambie, means that an Australian worker is still paying more tax than a",184
NA,backpacker. So that does not pass the fairness test.,184
NA,The third is: the employment of backpackers must be easy to administer. Wherever,184
NA,possible we should be trying to take the red tape and the workload off people who employ,184
NA,people. The fourth is: the workforce numbers must keep coming. This is where I want to,184
NA,touch on the amendments that Senator Xenophon is suggesting to the backpacker tax and to,184
NA,add my weight to those. What he is saying is: currently a person who is receiving,184
NA,"unemployment benefits, or currently a person who is receiving a pension, can lose much of",184
NA,those benefits if they go out and do a seasonal work job. I have a strong belief that the best,184
NA,way for a person to get a job is to have a job. So if we can make it easier for a person to be,184
NA,"engaged in the workforce, they are more likely to then stay engaged in the workforce.",184
NA,I think finding a landing of anywhere between 15 and 19 per cent is fair. I think,184
NA,encouraging and making it easier for people to work a season-and many of our pensioners in,184
NA,my patch would come out and work a season-and not lose their benefits would also be fair. I,184
NA,"think we need to land this one. Ultimately, the great opportunities there are only realised if we",184
NA,have people who are going to go out and work in our fields. We can grow the economy. We,184
NA,"must give certainly. I think, and I hope, the parliament is big enough to resolve this one",184
NA,clearly.,184
NA,Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program,184
Ms RISHWORTH ,Kingston) (19:48): The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary,184
NA,Program offers a unique opportunity to parliamentarians like myself to gain a better,184
NA,understanding of the roles our ADF play in supporting Australia's national interests in the,184
NA,world.,184
NA,"I was joined by my parliamentary colleagues the member for Bruce, the member for",184
NA,"Solomon and the member for Dunkley, as well as Senator James Patterson and Senator Skye",184
NA,"Kakoschke-Moore, in visiting our ADF personnel recently on operations in the Middle East.",184
NA,"The ADF currently have four major operations in the Middle East, undertaking missions on",184
NA,"land, in the air and at sea. These include Operation OKRA, Operation HIGHROAD,",184
NA,Operation MANITOU and Operation ACCORDIAN. In the short two-to-three-day briefing,184
NA,and training we received on arrival-which everyone deploying into the Middle East theatre,184
NA,of operations is required to undertake-it quickly became obvious to me that there is a great,184
NA,deal of complexity and skill involved in Australia's ongoing contribution to these operations.,184
NA,"The ADF leave nothing to chance, and I witnessed their professionalism and commitment to",184
NA,NA,184
NA,"ensuring our deploying troops have all of the training, preparation and support to undertake",185
NA,their missions safely.,185
NA,Seeing firsthand the main logistics hub for the Middle Eastern region gave me a great deal,185
NA,of insight into the scale of support needed to ensure that Australia's success occurs in the,185
NA,"offshore operations. As we visited the various missions, I was struck by the range of different",185
NA,roles our people are conducting in these joint operations and the diverse range of skills,185
NA,inherent to our Defence Force personnel.,185
NA,I would particularly like to mention the ADF personnel I met who are supporting the air,185
NA,campaign in Iraq and Syria. Their commitment to assisting the Iraqi forces in the fight against,185
NA,Daesh is a significant Australian contribution to the coalition effort. What especially struck,185
NA,me was the seriousness and professionalism with which they undertook their duties. These,185
NA,"personnel clearly understood the grave consequences of their actions, always holding",185
NA,"themselves accountable, constantly considering all of the secondand third-order effects on",185
NA,the civilian population before making operational decisions. This was an overwhelmingly,185
NA,proud and humbling experience for me that I was able to hear about firsthand.,185
NA,"I would also like to mention 7 RAR, who are based in my home state of South Australia at",185
NA,Edinburgh. The regiment is playing an exceptionally important force protection role for our,185
NA,"military, mentoring teams in Afghanistan. I was surprised to learn that several of the young 7",185
NA,RAR soldiers that I spoke to were undertaking their first operational deployment overseas. It,185
NA,was surprising because I could not fault their professionalism and the pride they took in their,185
NA,mission. I also spoke personally with our military mentors who are helping to rebuild and,185
NA,professionalise the Afghan army officer corps training at the Afghan National Army Officer,185
NA,Academy in the Qargha area of Kabul. Our mentors are doing an excellent job to train the,185
NA,"trainers at the academy, ensuring that these officers are equipped to provide military and",185
NA,leadership training to future Afghan army officers. This initiative will clearly enable the,185
NA,government of Afghanistan to have a professional and well-trained army to ensure the future,185
NA,security of their country. There was an overwhelming sense of gratitude from the Afghan,185
NA,"trainers, who expressed to me their appreciation of the guidance our Australian officers",185
NA,"provide them. In concert with the deployed UK forces, it is clear to me that our military",185
NA,mentors are making a valuable contribution to the future of a safe and secure Afghanistan.,185
NA,The time spent on the ADF PP enabled me to see firsthand the investment Australia is,185
NA,"making in the Middle East, and our efforts and contribution are significant. Most importantly,",185
NA,"I would like to acknowledge how hard our ADF personnel are working, both in Australia and",185
NA,"on deployment, to support and prosecute the mission we have set them in the Middle East",185
NA,region. Their ongoing commitment and sacrifice-and that of their families-does not go,185
NA,unrecognised by this parliament. I pay tribute to them. Being away from loved ones is,185
NA,extremely difficult and we thank our ADF personnel for the sacrifice they make. I would like,185
NA,to thank Major Gregory Cranswick and Major Briana Sterling for their support. The,185
NA,"experience was incredibly humbling. What I can honestly say to this House is that, witnessing",185
NA,"our ADF personnel, I have never been more proud to be Australian.",185
NA,NA,185
NA,"Bihary, Mr Josh",186
NA,"Hoad, Mr Lew",186
Mr ALEXANDER ,"Bennelong) (19:53): Tonight, I would like to recognise and express",186
NA,"my gratitude to two friends and two mentors. Firstly, I would like to talk about Josh Bihary,",186
NA,who for the last six years has been my senior adviser-and I will tell you how we got started.,186
NA,"On the day before we came here for the very first time and I knew very little about this place,",186
NA,Josh got married. The honeymoon had to wait and Josh travelled the next day and commenced,186
NA,his training of this wayward child in the art of politics. I would come up with ideas; Josh,186
NA,would get the job to deliver them. We saw kids being left out of activities in playgrounds and,186
NA,we came up with the idea of introducing table tennis so kids of different ethnic backgrounds,186
NA,could play with each other and engage. We went to Hyundai with business plans that they,186
NA,"accepted, we got table tennis tables put in all 40 schools in the electorate and kids engage in",186
NA,"this great sport. We brought the Bennelong Cup here just last week, where eight countries",186
NA,"played at the highest level of table tennis. We saw problems in small businesses, where big",186
NA,"companies were squeezing them out, and we invented this thing called the Bennelong Village",186
NA,"Businesses campaign. We got discounts on advertising, we letter-dropped and we promoted",186
NA,small business. We saw a problem with people with disability not being able to find work. We,186
NA,came up with an idea called Bennelong Gardens and we got the land for them to establish,186
NA,commercial market gardens on and give themselves employment and that independence.,186
NA,"When we were writing the maiden speech, we came across the fact that we had never had a",186
NA,plan of spatial settlement and that we had effected this incredible imbalance of settlement. We,186
NA,have been working on that one ever since. We have come up with the concepts of retrofitting,186
NA,infrastructure and effecting decentralisation through high-speed rail. Many people laugh at,186
NA,"high-speed rail, but this can be funded through value capture. Five years ago, when we started",186
NA,"talking about value capture, nobody knew what value capture was. Now you will not see one",186
NA,day where a newspaper does not refer to value capture and the power of value capture to,186
NA,retrofit infrastructure into our cities. Infrastructure should be associated with land planning,186
NA,and the combination is dynamic because it uplifts the value of land that you can then capture,186
NA,the value from and create a sustainable funding model.,186
NA,"With Josh's integrity and friendship, you would not meet a more honest, decent and",186
NA,"hardworking man. Now his marriage has a greater chance of going much longer, until that",186
NA,awful moment when death might part us! They have two beautiful children and I apologise to,186
NA,Karen!,186
NA,"This week, I have the great pleasure of having Jenny Hoad staying in my house. On Friday,",186
NA,"we will play tennis. That is not that unusual, except Jenny is 84 years of age. I am so pleased",186
NA,"to have Jenny, who is Lew Hoad's widow, stay with me. Today is Lew Hoad's birthday. Lew",186
NA,"Hoad, in many people's minds, is the greatest tennis player that ever lived. Pancho Gonzales,",186
NA,"who was the world champion eight times, said he had no say in the outcome of matches when",186
NA,he played Lew-and then he would say some expletives about what he thought of Lew and,186
NA,"what he would do to him on a tennis court. Rod Laver, who was the greatest player of all in",186
NA,"many people's minds and won the grand slam twice, said he had no say in the outcome of",186
NA,matches when he played Lew and he thought Lew was the greatest player of all time. When,186
NA,"Rod won the grand slam in 1962 and turned professional, Lew had all but retired. Lew went",186
NA,"into training for six weeks and the tennis twins Ken Rosewall, the world professional",186
NA,NA,186
NA,"champion, and Lew played a series of 13 matches each against Rod Laver, the man who had",187
NA,just won the grand slam. Ken dominated Rod and won 11 out of those 13 matches. Lew,187
NA,dominated Rod to a greater extent and won all 13 matches-and continued to dominate Rod,187
NA,every time they played.,187
NA,"When I was a young boy of 10 years old, Lew gave us a tennis camp. He taught me",187
NA,"rhythm, evaluating shots and the essence of professional or percentage tennis. He would come",187
NA,out to our house and look in on how I was going on the way to waterski at the Narrabeen,187
NA,lakes. He was always friendly and engaging whenever I ran into him at Wimbledon or the,187
NA,"French Open. He remained a friend. Tragically, leukaemia took him at the age of 60. We have",187
NA,"agreed to do a 100-kilometre walk around Bennelong, as we did for motor neurone disease",187
NA,"last year, to raise awareness of the great Lew Hoad and raise awareness of and raise money",187
NA,for leukaemia.,187
NA,"Timms, Ms Michelle",187
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies) (19:58): I rise to acknowledge tonight one of Australia's,187
NA,"greatest sportswomen, Michelle Timms, who just recently was inducted as the first legend in",187
NA,"the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame and, indeed, prior to that was named in the",187
NA,"international federation hall of fame, only the second Australian to be named after the male",187
NA,player Andrew Gaze. Michelle started with the Bulleen Boomers in my electorate in 1984 and,187
NA,completed her career as a player with the Phoenix Mercury from 1997 to 2001. She,187
NA,"subsequently became a coach, most recently the assistant coach of the Chinese national team.",187
NA,She made 264 appearances for the Australian national team. She participated in four world,187
NA,"championships and three Olympic Games, winning a silver medal and a bronze medal. She",187
NA,"has just returned to Bulleen, where, indeed, her daughter is now playing basketball and",187
NA,hoping to emulate her mother.,187
NA,"Known as 'Timmsy', Michelle, at just five feet four inches tall, was one of the grittiest",187
NA,players in world basketball. The point guard player pioneered the involvement of Australians,187
NA,"at a world level. With her familiar crop of short hair, she was one of the most feared",187

The DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Ms Bird) took the chair at 10:00.,188
NA,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,188
NA,Franklin Electorate: Centrelink and Medicare,188
Ms COLLINS ,Franklin) (10:00): Members in this place might remember earlier this year,188
NA,when a Centrelink and Medicare office in my electorate was slated for closure by the coalition,188
NA,government. Senator Catryna Bilyk and I ran a community campaign and had a petition with,188
NA,"more than 3,000 signatures, and we managed to get the government to backflip on its decision",188
NA,to close the Centrelink office. What they did was co-locate the Centrelink office with a,188
NA,"Service Tasmania office, which is a one-stop shop for state government services. We raised",188
NA,some concerns with the minister at the time and with local Liberal Senators Eric Abetz and,188
NA,David Bushby about the services that would be at this new Service Tasmania co-location with,188
NA,Centrelink and Medicare.,188
NA,"In March I got a letter back from the Minister for Human Services, Alan Tudge, where the",188
NA,minister assured me in writing that the agreement with Service Tasmania 'will result in no,188
NA,"change to the service offering for Kingston residents'. Sadly, there has been a change in",188
NA,services-and not for the better. Both my office and Senator Bilyk's office have been,188
NA,"overwhelmed with concerned people talking about the lack of privacy in the new centre,",188
NA,talking about their concerns about not being able to get the services that they once accessed at,188
NA,"the previous Kingston office, and talking about how they are now being told that they need to",188
NA,travel into Hobart for those services.,188
NA,What I do not think the minister fully understood at the time is that the Centrelink and,188
NA,"Medicare office is the only Medicare office south of Hobart for many thousands of residents,",188
NA,and we are talking about areas where there is not a lot of good public transport. The,188
NA,Centrelink office in Hobart is poorly located and not on a public transport route. It is very,188
NA,difficult for residents from the Huon and Kingborough areas generally to get access to,188
NA,Centrelink and Medicare services in Hobart. We are so concerned about this that Senator,188
NA,Bilyk and I have written to the whole Kingston and Blackmans Bay communities asking them,188
NA,to fill out a survey about their experiences at that new Centrelink and Medicare office.,188
NA,"What we want to do is go back to the minister and remind him of his undertaking, remind",188
NA,him that he said there would be no reduction in services and prove to him that there has,188
NA,indeed been a substantial reduction in services. What this government is doing to people who,188
NA,are relying on Medicare and Centrelink services is not good enough. They should be ashamed,188
NA,of what is happening to this very important public service that so many of our citizens rely on.,188
NA,"When they go to the doctor and they need a reimbursement-yes, it is all moving towards",188
NA,"being electronic, but there are times when you need a face-to-face interview. There are times",188
NA,"when you cannot resolve your issue over the phone or on an app, or the app is down or you",188
NA,have to wait forever in a queue-for several hours sometimes-on the phone to Centrelink,188
NA,"and Medicare. Sometimes you need that face-to-face interaction, and the residents in my area",188
NA,"of Kingston, Blackmans Bay and down the Huon deserve that service. I am going to keep",188
NA,fighting for them to get it.,188

NA,Water Safety,189
Mr EVANS ,"Brisbane) (10:03): As we move into summer, as temperatures rise and the",189
NA,"school holidays start, Australians will be following a long-time tradition in flocking to the",189
NA,"water-pools, the beach, creeks, rivers and dams all around our continent. I would like to take",189
NA,"this opportunity to raise the awareness of Brisbane families, and all families around Australia,",189
NA,"of the importance of water safety. Australia, sadly, has some of the worst drowning statistics",189
NA,of any country around the world. It should not surprise anybody to know that the drownings,189
NA,"are most likely to occur over the summer period. In the 12 months to 30 June this year,",189
NA,"Australia recorded about 280 drownings-in other words, about one a day-and 66 of those",189
NA,fatalities unfortunately were in Queensland. Far too many of those who drowned were kids.,189
NA,I have spoken previously in this chamber about the great work of Kidsafe Queensland in,189
NA,their work to raise awareness around kids' safety and reducing accidents around the home. I,189
NA,want to commend all parents who are taking steps to ensure their children learn to swim. Last,189
NA,week I was able to visit a local business in Brisbane teaching swimming and water safety to,189
NA,children from the earliest ages. I met with Ben Holland and his very energetic and passionate,189
NA,"team at the Aquatic Achievers swim school based in Paddington, who are doing great work",189
NA,"preparing our kids-and their parents-for the pool, beach and creeks this summer.",189
NA,"In encouraging all parents to consider talking to their kids about water safety, taking them",189
NA,"to swim schools and enjoying the summer safely, I would also highlight some other benefits",189
NA,of swimming in terms of giving kids a chance to be more active and fit. The recent Active,189
NA,Healthy Kids Australia report card gave Australian kids a D minus for overall physical,189
NA,activity levels. National data indicates that only about one in five Aussie kids is meeting the,189
NA,"daily physical activity guidelines, which recommend about 60 minutes a day of physical",189
NA,activity. I hope we can inspire more families to take advantage of their local swim schools for,189
NA,the fitness benefits and also because every drowning that occurs is one too many.,189
NA,"I also note that earlier this year the Turnbull government, in conjunction with the",189
NA,"Australian Water Safety Council, launched the Australian Water Safety Strategy 2016-2020.",189
NA,"The strategy outlines priority areas where various water safety bodies, governments at",189
NA,different levels and other interested stakeholders can work together to prevent drownings. It,189
NA,aims to reduce fatal drownings by 50 per cent by the year 2020.,189
NA,"In closing, I would like to commend the work of the team at the Aquatic Achievers swim",189
NA,school in Paddington. I would like to give a shout-out to the Queensland surf lifesavers; to,189
NA,Kidsafe and the many other water safety bodies doing great work around Australia; and to the,189
NA,"Hon. Sussan Ley, the Minister for Health and Aged Care and Minister for Sport, for her role",189
NA,"in launching the Australian Water Safety Strategy. Most of all, I would like to dedicate this",189
NA,"speech to the parents helping their kids to learn to swim. I urge all families, when taking to",189
NA,"the water this summer, to be safe.",189
NA,Pensions and Benefits: Pension Assets Test,189
Mr CONROY ,Shortland) (10:06): On 1 January 2017 the Turnbull government's cuts to,189
NA,"the pension assets test will kick in. These will cut the age pension for 330,000 elderly",189
NA,"Australians. Nearly 3,000 pensioners in Shortland will have their pension cut or cancelled.",189
NA,"The average reduction in income is nearly $4,000 per annum and, since over a quarter of the",189
NA,"residents in Shortland are over the age of 60, this will have a profound impact in my",189
NA,NA,189
NA,electorate. It is another example of this government's appalling attack on pensioners in our,190
NA,"community. Pensioners who have done the right thing throughout their lives, pensioners who",190
NA,"have made a great contribution to our community, are under relentless attack from this",190
NA,"government, which does not care about them.",190
NA,Independent analysis shows that these new cuts will affect half of all new retirees within 10,190
NA,"years. More than a million retirees will be affected by these cuts, including 700,000 people",190
NA,who will retire in the next decade. Any pensioner home owner couple with more than,190
NA,"$375,000 in assets will have their part pension cut, and any single home owner pensioner with",190
NA,"more than $250,000 in assets will have their part pension cut. Currently, for every $1,000 of",190
NA,assets that you own over the assets-free area your pension is reduced by $1.50 per fortnight.,190
NA,From 1 January next year it will be $3. So the most profound impact of this change to the,190
NA,assets test will not be on pensioners at the top end with regard to assets. It will be on those in,190
NA,"the middle: pensioners who might have somewhere between $300,000 and $500,000 worth of",190
NA,"assets, which is not an unreasonable amount if they have, say, sold up in Sydney and retired to",190
NA,my region to enjoy the much better quality of life. They will be profoundly impacted by these,190
NA,changes.,190
NA,I am proud that Labor and I voted against the Liberal government's changes to the pension,190
NA,"assets test. We opposed it in parliament. Unfortunately, the Greens and Liberals did, yet",190
NA,"again, another dirty deal to cut the pension. There will be another impact on 190,000",190
NA,pensioners if the Prime Minister gets his way and limits overseas travel for Australian,190
NA,pensioners.,190
NA,Another issue is the failure of this government to update deeming rates in line with falling,190
NA,interest rates. The government has failed to adjust the deeming rates for more than 18 months,190
NA,despite the official interest rate falling from 2¼ per cent to 1½ per cent. This is another,190
NA,pension cut by stealth.,190
NA,"I am proud to be part of the Labor Party, which introduced the pension and gave pensioners",190
NA,"the greatest rise ever. Those on the other side, the Liberal-National government, are only",190
NA,concerned with cutting the pension while at the same time giving a $48 billion tax cut to their,190
NA,corporate mates. Yet again it demonstrates the skewed priorities of those on the other side:,190
NA,cutting pensions while giving a tax cut to the richest people in our community. I say: shame,190
NA,on Mr Turnbull and his government!,190
NA,Bradfield Electorate: Stronger Communities Program,190
Mr FLETCHER ,Bradfield-Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (10:09): I am very,190
NA,pleased to rise to speak about the Hornsby Eco Garden. This project in Hornsby is funded in,190
NA,part by the Turnbull government's Stronger Communities Program. It will be built on a site on,190
NA,"the corner of Sherbrooke Road and Burdett Street in Hornsby, within my electorate, and will",190
NA,give members of the local community a chance to learn some of the principles of,190
NA,permaculture and to generally improve their health and wellbeing.,190
NA,I want to congratulate Hornsby council for the work it has done in supporting this,190
NA,important initiative. I particularly also want to congratulate all of the members of the,190
NA,"community who developed this concept, secured the support of Hornsby council and then put",190
NA,forward a compelling grant application under the Stronger Communities Program. I had the,190
NA,chance to meet a number of those involved in developing and championing this concept at the,190
NA,NA,190
NA,future site of the Hornsby Eco Garden just a few Saturdays ago. I was extremely impressed,191
NA,with the plans that the community has for the development of this garden and their vision of,191
NA,"this garden as being a place where people who live in the surrounding area, including those",191
NA,"who might live in apartments and who do not have a garden of their own, to come and enjoy",191
NA,"the garden and participate in planting, tending and harvesting of the plants that will form part",191
NA,of this garden.,191
NA,This is exactly the kind of initiative which the Stronger Communities Program is designed,191
NA,to support and I am very pleased at the range and calibre of projects which are being,191
NA,supported under the Stronger Communities Program in Bradfield. Some of the other projects,191
NA,which are being supported include the funding of a Meals on Wheels delivery van for,191
NA,"$20,000, improvements to the Triple H broadcasting studio at Waitara for over $6,000 and the",191
NA,purchase of portable goals for the Northern Suburbs Football Association.,191
NA,"There is a consistent theme across all of these projects, including the Hornsby Eco Garden,",191
NA,"which is that this funding supports the work of dedicated members of the community,",191
NA,typically meeting needs which they have identified and which they have taken action to,191
NA,"address. This is an example of government funding, in a modest way, supporting very",191
NA,worthwhile community initiatives. I congratulate all involved in the Hornsby Eco Garden and,191
NA,all of the other projects that have secured funding under the Stronger Communities Program,191
NA,in Bradfield.,191
NA,Kennedy Electorate: Water,191
Mr KATTER ,"Kennedy) (10:12): The annual streamflow of the Flinders River, one of",191
NA,"Australia's biggest rivers, is 6.6 million megalitres. This means that in some years it runs",191
NA,much greater than that and in some years it runs less. The federal parliament and Senate,191
NA,"unanimously resolved, with the support of the Greens, to allocate around six million",191
NA,megalitres for the Murray-Darling waters for irrigation. This is around 27 per cent of 21,191
NA,"million megalitres streamflow in the Murray-Darling. Applied to the Flinders River, this",191
NA,formula would provide over two million megalitres for irrigation.,191
NA,"However, in an extraordinary and appalling decision, the Queensland water resources",191
NA,"department of the Queensland government has decided that only 350,000 megalitres will be",191
NA,"allocated. Infinitely worse still, it has allocated that 350,000 megalitres to absentee landlord",191
NA,"corporations-two of the biggest agricultural corporations in Australia, whose shareholders",191
NA,"include two of the richest families in Australia. In sharp contrast, the Hughenden irrigation",191
NA,"development corporation, a type of cooperative, requested 200,000 megalitres of the two",191
NA,million megalitres that should be available for irrigation. Within 10 days of the Hughenden,191
NA,community benefit application being received by the Queensland minister-after the,191
NA,government had sat for 15 months on the application-he rushed the golden handshake for,191
NA,these two big corporations though to a completed allocation.,191
NA,"Water is sold in New South Wales at $850 a megalitre. If 230,000 has been allocated to",191
NA,"these corporations, as we have heard, then clearly they have received $180 million of",191
NA,allocation: a decision by water resources and their minister to enrich the rich with a $100,191
NA,million golden handshake and to leave the poor infinitely poorer without this water. Since,191
NA,"QWRD is only making 350,000 megalitres for allocation, this water is taken, by definition,",191
NA,"off the Hughenden and Cloncurry communities, which desperately need that water, and",191
NA,"people who live in North Queensland and given to two absentee landlord corporations, both",191
NA,NA,191
NA,of which may or may not be sold to the Chinese in the near future. Whilst there is no,192
NA,"conceivable way one could justify the minister's decision, nor its curious timing, there can be",192
NA,no earthly justification for the actions of QWRD.,192
NA,"The history of mismanagement has cost the people of Queensland over $1,000 million: the",192
NA,Tully-Millstream debacle; the Traveston dam; $300 million in inquiries into northern water,192
NA,"schemes, with no schemes having ever been built; the Gold Coast desalination plant; and,",192
NA,"worst of all, the Cubbie Station decision. A $130 million golden handshake was given to one",192
NA,"person, and the officer enabling and facilitating that then moved out to take a position of",192
NA,employment with Cubbie Station. Probably the worst aspect of this decision was that it led to,192
NA,a corruptive water allocation system on the Murray-Darling. (Time expired),192

NA,"distinguished contribution of Professor Colleen Hayward AM, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and head",192
NA,"of Kurongkurl Katitjin, ECU's Centre for Indigenous Education and Research. It is",192
NA,commendable to have such a leading service operating from our local university.,192
NA,"Since its establishment in 1997, HealthInfoNet has been addressing the need for",192
NA,policymakers and health practitioners to have access to the best and most up-to-date,192
NA,knowledge and information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. An important,192
NA,focus of the service is on the development of knowledge exchange tools and resources that,192
NA,synthesise research and other information related to a wide variety of health issues. These,192
NA,resources provided a time-poor health workforce with the capacity to quickly and effectively,192
NA,enhance their knowledge and skills to guide their everyday work in Aboriginal and Torres,192
NA,Strait Islander communities.,192
NA,"With over a million visits per year to its web resource, 5,000 easily searchable pages of",192

NA,and people who work so hard together to build a community. I remember Werribee when it,193
NA,was a small town. Now it is one of the fastest growing growth corridors in the country and a,193
NA,"large city of over 200,000, but we still have not lost that sense of responsibility to and for one",193

Mr DANBY ,Melbourne Ports) (10:25): The electorate of Melbourne Ports is the heart of,194

NA,"there, including the Melbourne Recital Centre, the Malthouse Theatre, the Australian Centre",194
NA,"for Contemporary Art, the Arts Centre Melbourne and the National Gallery of Victoria. Some",194
NA,"of our educational facilities include the Victorian College of the Arts, The Australian Ballet",194
NA,"School, the Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School and our beloved Australian",194
NA,National Academy of Music. On 13 November I was at ANAM to attend a community event,194

NA,"Venezuelan conductor Ilyich Rivas, accompanied by the equally gifted Elsternwick vocalist",194
NA,"Lior, along with staff and guests in a breathtaking performance for the local community.",194
NA,All of these institutions are feeling the pressure from this federal government's cuts to the,194
NA,arts. I have spoken about it many times in this parliament. In most cases the state governments,194
NA,"are being forced to pick up shortfalls, as is being done with the Australian National Academy",194
NA,of Music. Anyone who has been to St Kilda knows the famous National Theatre on the corner,194
NA,"of Barkly and Carlisle streets, which, after the Second World War, used to be called the",194
NA,"Victory Theatre. A wonderful ballet school operates from there-my niece, Shani, attended-",194
NA,"and, of course, it has highly developed diplomas for high-end drama workers and dancers.",194
NA,The Australian National Memorial Theatre's Susan Thacore and I met education minister,194
NA,Birmingham to discuss funding cuts affecting diplomas in acting and ballet. Minister,194
NA,Birmingham advised us that the current model will not be revised for several months and that,194
NA,"state governments skills tests need to be looked at, to see whether or not the artists who",194
NA,graduated from there can continue to get VET support. I understand the states are reviewing,194
NA,NA,194
NA,"their skill lists; however, it may prove too late for some students, as two states are required to",195
NA,list before VET-FEE HELP becomes available.,195
NA,The National Theatre Melbourne Drama School graduates include Kat Stewart and Richard,195
NA,"Harris from Offspring, Richard Cawthorne, Lawrence Mooney and Bella Heathcote. The",195
NA,"National Theatre's ballet graduates include: the great Amber Scott, who is currently principal",195
NA,artist at The Australian Ballet and board director of The National Theatre; soloist with The,195
NA,"Australian Ballet Jarryd Madden; and Alice Top, a highly awarded choreographer who also",195
NA,graduated from The National Theatre. In the last couple of weeks three of the advanced,195
NA,diploma students have been snapped up for professional caress at the West Australian Ballet,195
NA,and the Singapore Ballet.,195
NA,"This institution obviously produces the highest quality drama workers, actors and ballet",195
NA,dancers. It is not the kind of institution that should have been cut back as a result of the,195
NA,minister's campaign against colleges that are producing people from invented courses at the,195

NA,Canning Electorate: Dawesville Chemmart Pharmacy,195
Mr HASTIE ,Canning) (10:28): In March this year I became aware that the Dawesville,195
NA,"Chemmart Pharmacy, in my electorate of Canning, was unable to dispense medications listed",195
NA,"on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, making it economically vulnerable as a small",195
NA,"business. More importantly, it was unable to perform its primary function as a chemist of",195
NA,"providing a basic service to the local community, a community where many people rely upon",195
NA,their local chemist for their health.,195
NA,This was just ridiculous. 'Why?' you may ask. The reason for this is that the pharmacy did,195
NA,not meet the requirements that would allow it to be issued with a PBS approval number.,195
NA,"These requirements state: 'At all relevant times there is, within 500 metres, in a straight line",195
NA,"from the proposed premises, a supermarket with a gross leasable area of at least 1,000 square",195
NA,metres.' The closest supermarket to the pharmacy at the Dawesville Shopping Centre met this,195
NA,"requirement, under the definition of 'gross leasable area', but fell 25 square metres short under",195
NA,"the definition of 'gross leasable area retail'. In other words, the pharmacy could not dispense",195
NA,PBS medication because the nearest shopping centre fell short of the size requirement by 25,195
NA,"square metres. I call this quibbling. This decision left the community of 7,215 people without",195
NA,"suitable access to PBS medications. It is no surprise, then, that when the Dawesville",195
NA,"Chemmart started a petition to have this decision overruled, it ended up with 2,300",195
NA,signatures-over 30 per cent of the local population. My office also received a number of,195
NA,"letters, emails and phone calls about this matter. Many elderly residents cannot easily travel",195
NA,the 18-kilometre round trip to the nearest PBS-approved pharmacy.,195
NA,I want to congratulate the local community for their leadership in fighting this regulation. It,195
NA,"shows they have strong, grassroots local leadership. But more importantly, they do not wait",195
NA,"for government to fix things, nor do they tolerate bad regulation. To me and to the many",195
NA,"people affected by this decision, this was an example of red tape getting the way of common",195
NA,sense. The coalition's priority is to encourage job growth; to encourage small business and to,195
NA,protect Australians from senseless regulation that negatively impacts their lives. That is why I,195
NA,"was very pleased to announce that thanks to the Hon. Susan Ley, Minister for Health, the",195
NA,Dawesville Chemmart pharmacy last week received confirmation that it will soon be able to,195
NA,dispense PBS medications. This means that local people will be able to access PBS,195
NA,NA,195
NA,"medicines, and it will also protect that small business-and its employees-from closure.",196
NA,"Common sense has prevailed, the Commonwealth government has acted, and the people of",196

NA,"occurs every year, and on 19 November it was time for the annual Pride Parade to",196
NA,commence-there is a reason why my voice has been a bit hoarse in the course of this week! I,196
NA,am very proud to have marched alongside my comrades in Rainbow Labor in the parade. The,196
NA,"parade was a wonderful occasion that started on Brisbane Street, went down the heart of",196
NA,William Street in Northbridge and then finished on Lake Street. There were thousands of,196
NA,"people involved in the parade, and the overwhelming theme of the parade was 'Love wins'.",196
NA,"Under the banner of 'Love wins,' I was very proud to march alongside other members of the",196
NA,"Labor Party-my federal colleagues from this place, my state colleagues, and also local",196
NA,"candidates in the upcoming state election, including our candidate from Mount Lawley,",196
NA,"Simon Millman-alongside a Rainbow Labor banner, proudly advocating for marriage",196
NA,equality.,196
NA,What resonated all the way through that march was the feedback from the community-,196
NA,"mums and dads, kids, grandmas and grandpas-all of whom were only too happy to join in",196
NA,"the chorus advocating for marriage equality. You see, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is",196
NA,"overwhelmingly clear that, just because the legislation may have slipped off the radar in this",196
NA,"place, the desire and sentiment in our community to make marriage equality a reality has not",196
NA,"diminished one single bit. There was uniform endorsement for Labor's position, as we proudly",196
NA,marched along the streets on Saturday night advocating for marriage equality. The reason for,196
NA,the hoarseness of my voice is because I started the chant-perhaps not being the most,196
NA,"seasoned campaigner!-right at the start of the march, before realising that I had to keep my",196
NA,"tone and passion up for the entire 45 minutes or so. But I tell you what, it was fantastic. I am",196
NA,"glad I went out so hard and so early, and maintained the rage, because every single step along",196
NA,the way was met with a glowing affirmation to my calls: 'What do we want?'-'Marriage,196
NA,"equality!' And, 'When do we want it?'-'Right now!' And that was precisely what we said",196
NA,"from start to finish. Well done, Rainbow Labor-well done, Sonia; well done, Oskar; well",196
NA,"done, Andy; well done, Brock-maintain the rage.",196
NA,Mackellar Electorate: Stronger Communities Program,196
Mr FALINSKI ,Mackellar) (10:34): I stand before you today to highlight the amazing,196
NA,work that the countless community groups in Mackellar are doing every single day. In the,196
NA,"Northern Beaches, we do not wait around for others to fix problems. We come together as a",196
NA,"community and we act. That being said, the Turnbull government's message is clear: if you",196
NA,"are putting others first, if you get together and make your community a better place, we will",196
NA,support you. Our Stronger Communities Program has seen many recipients of well-deserved,196
NA,funds. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service volunteers on Scotland Island dedicate,196
NA,countless hours and energy to one goal: to help others and strengthen their community. To,196
NA,NA,196
NA,"support their ongoing service they have received $25,000 to fund, among other things, a",197
NA,station extension.,197
NA,"I am proud that this government is supporting the Life Education Centre, with close to",197
NA,"$10,000 in funding to help provide preventive drug and health education. I speak not only for",197
NA,myself but for the parents of the Northern Beaches in thanking you for your work.,197
NA,Living in one of the most beautiful parts of the world we are so lucky to be surrounded by,197
NA,"water-beaches, bays and lagoons. The Terrey Hills radio room of Marine Rescue New South",197
NA,Wales are but one of the groups of unsung heroes of our waterways. They tirelessly work to,197
NA,keep all of us safe on the water and will finally be able to upgrade their facilities with over,197
NA,$8½ thousand in funding.,197
NA,"It would be remiss of me not to thank the thousands of locals, young and old, who take it",197
NA,upon themselves to patrol our 18 beaches every summer we can. Our surf life saving clubs not,197
NA,"only keep our beaches safe, but are a place for the community to gather for leadership, for",197
NA,"mentorship and, most importantly, for friendship. I am immensely proud that, under the",197
NA,"Stronger Communities Program, we have announced close to $35,000 to upgrade the facilities",197
NA,"of surf life saving clubs at Avalon, Collaroy and Palm Beach.",197
NA,The Australian Outrigger Canoe Racing Association of New South Wales is a cornerstone,197
NA,group for the numerous paddlers in our community. They will now be able to invest in their,197
NA,"GPS location and safety equipment with $8,250 in funding from the Turnbull government.",197
NA,They are the people who ensure all racers have a good and safe time on the water.,197
NA,Port Adelaide Electorate: Ex-Service Clubs,197
Mr BUTLER ,Port Adelaide) (10:37): Today I rise to thank and recognise RSLs and the,197
NA,other service organisations in the electorate of Port Adelaide for convening the Remembrance,197
NA,"Day services on 11 November this year-from Salisbury RSL to the Seaton RSL, from the",197
NA,"West Croydon RSL to the Largs RSL. And, being a port electorate, we also host the Naval",197
NA,Association of South Australia and a very active Merchant Navy Association as well. All of,197
NA,those organisations worked very hard to convene Remembrance Day services this year. But I,197
NA,"want to pay particular attention to the Semaphore and Port Adelaide RSL service, which I",197
NA,"attend on Anzac Day every year. It is the biggest service in the area; at times, it is the biggest",197
NA,"service in South Australia. On Anzac Day it convenes 10,000 people at the Semaphore Angel",197
NA,"of Peace. The other reason I attend that service is that in 1924, on behalf of the RSL, my great",197
NA,great uncle laid the stone at the angel at the historic settlement at Semaphore.,197
NA,I want to congratulate the sub-branch and President Colin Johns for their service this year.,197
NA,"It was a beautiful service that was very well attended by the community. Importantly, it was",197
NA,attended by a number of the school communities in the area. The Alberton Primary School,197
NA,was out there in force and Lucinda Wetherill made a great speech on behalf of young people,197
NA,in the community. Songs were sung by the Dominican Choir and there was generally a very,197
NA,strong level of support demonstrated by the community. As was pointed out by President,197
NA,"Colin Johns, this year is the 100th anniversary of the RSL in Australia. I want to pay tribute to",197
NA,"the extraordinary work that that organisation has done on behalf of our nation and, in",197
NA,"particular, returned service men and women.",197
NA,The theme at Semaphore on 11 November was 'Passing the torch'-the importance of,197
NA,"RSLs continually thinking about refreshing their organisations. The point was made that, in",197
NA,NA,197
NA,"spite of that extraordinary work-support services to returned servicemen, advocacy for",198
NA,things like the campaign that my great-uncle Charlie led in the 1920s to ensure that returned,198
NA,"servicemen had preference in employment within state public services, and a safe place for",198
NA,returned servicemen to go and be among comrades who understood what they had gone,198
NA,through-it needs to be recognised that it has not been perfect. The Largs Bay RSL in my,198
NA,electorate was set up because returned servicemen from World War II did not feel welcome at,198
NA,"the RSL club at Semaphore. My father is a Vietnam vet and was among 50,000 Vietnam vets",198
NA,who too often did not feel welcome when they returned. The message from president Colin,198
NA,"Johns was to recognise the importance of looking to the present and the future, as well as the",198
NA,"past. We have 40,000 men and women returning from service in the Middle East who must be",198
NA,the subject of our ongoing attention.,198
NA,Telecommunications,198
NA,NA,198
NA,"telecommunications across my electorate of Barker. Upon being elected in 2013, I was",198
NA,excited to see the coalition government's Mobile Black Spot Program rolled out across the,198
NA,nation. I looked forward to reaping some of these dividends for regional South Australia. The,198
NA,"coalition recognised that, in order to attract investment in telecommunications in rural,",198
NA,"regional and remote areas, the government needs to incentivise telecommunication companies",198
NA,to invest in the less densely populated areas of our nation. How naive I was to think that our,198
NA,state government in South Australia might too recognise and appreciate this need!,198
NA,Round 1 of the Mobile Black Spot Program included a $100 million commitment from the,198
NA,"federal government. In addition to the federal government funding, telecommunications",198
NA,companies contributed $185 million and state and territory governments contributed $87,198
NA,"million. I should also pause to acknowledge local government, businesses and community",198
NA,contributions of $1.7 million. This cooperative approach to improving mobile black spots in,198
NA,regional areas across the country resulted in 499 improved or new mobile phone towers from,198
NA,a pool of $385 million. Of the $87 million contributed by state governments to round 1 of the,198
NA,"program, the South Australian Labor government contributed a whopping nothing. It is little",198
NA,wonder that South Australia received the bare minimum number of tower upgrades. In my,198
NA,"electorate, it was a paltry two.",198
NA,Compare this to our Victorian neighbours across the border. The Victorian government saw,198
NA,"the opportunity that, sadly, the South Australian state Labor government did not. The",198
NA,"Victorian government contributed $21 million to the program. Accordingly, the Victorian",198
NA,government and the Victorians of this great nation received 110 towers. South Australia was,198
NA,competing with other mainland states that had contributed between $10 million and $32,198
NA,million. Our state Labor government put up a total of nothing. Despite a long and dedicated,198
NA,campaign by me and my federal colleague the member for Grey to lobby the state government,198
NA,"to contribute a meaningful sum to round 2, Jay Weatherill's Labor government have again",198
NA,"failed us, this time putting forward an insulting $2 million. That was all they could spare to",198
NA,"resolve one of the major issues for regional South Australians, at a time when they were",198
NA,spending $60 million to shave seven minutes off a bus trip from the northern suburbs of,198
NA,Adelaide. The question remains: what will $2 million translate into for South Australia? I fear,198
NA,"it will be very little, and you have Jay Weatherill to blame for it.",198
NA,NA,198
NA,Grayndler Electorate: Roads,199
Mr ALBANESE ,"Grayndler) (10:43): Today I rise to give voice to the concerns,",199
NA,frustration and suffering of my constituents in the suburb of Haberfield who are being,199
NA,adversely affected by the construction of the WestConnex project. Many have experienced,199
NA,"ongoing noise pollution as a result of late-night construction works, as well as increased risk",199
NA,"to pedestrian safety caused by large-truck movements in local streets. For several months,",199
NA,residents in Wattle Street and adjoining areas have been suffering from unacceptable late-,199
NA,night noise between 9 pm and 5 am. Older residents and families with small children have,199
NA,been particularly impacted and are finding the ongoing noise pollution very distressing.,199
NA,Residents have informed me that they have continually raised concerns with the Sydney,199
NA,Motorway Corporation and New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services about the impact,199
NA,this noise is having on their sleep patterns and quality of life.,199
NA,"Unfortunately, to date the response from New South Wales government agencies has been",199
NA,hopelessly inadequate. This extraordinary level of late-night noise pollution is certainly not,199
NA,acceptable. I understand that RMS would prefer to carry out works at night in order to,199
NA,minimise daytime disruption to traffic flows and to expedite completion of the project;,199
NA,"however, indefinitely sacrificing the quality of life of hundreds of Haberfield residents in",199
NA,order to meet these objectives is unfair and unprofessional. The failure to police limits on the,199
NA,movement of heavy vehicles in local streets in Haberfield is also posing safety risks for,199
NA,residents there.,199
NA,There are specified routes that trucks working on WestConnex are required to use;,199
NA,"however, residents have continually reported to me that drivers are not adhering to this plan.",199
NA,"In addition to that, some of the work that has been carried out in streets such as Northcote",199
NA,Street have occurred before the notification has gone out to residents saying that this work,199
NA,"will occur. When this was raised with one of the workers on site, he said, 'That way we'll get",199
NA,less complaints'. And they wonder why the community are concerned about these issues!,199
NA,"Once quiet streets, including those on which primary schools and childcare centres are",199
NA,"located, have now become thoroughfares for large and dangerous vehicles because conditions",199
NA,of consent for this project are not being enforced. Added to that is the anguish caused by the,199
NA,"fact that the head of the planning system in New South Wales, Lucy Turnbull, stated that she",199
NA,was not even aware that houses were being demolished in the heritage suburb of Haberfield.,199
NA,The New South Wales government has a responsibility to protect the amenity of people living,199
NA,"in Haberfield; they are not doing the right thing, and they must do better.",199
NA,Goldstein Electorate: Black Rock Life Saving Club,199
NA,Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (10:46): Today I would like to draw attention to the state,199
NA,of the Black Rock Life Saving Club in the wonderful electorate of Goldstein. Over its 88-year,199
NA,"history, the club has consistently provided a safe, friendly and welcoming environment for its",199
NA,members and its visitors. The club's volunteers promote the benefits of healthy outdoor,199
NA,"activities, water safety, and an awareness of the beach and the aquatic environment that we",199
NA,"are so blessed with on Port Phillip Bay. Last year, Black Rock volunteers performed 2,399",199
NA,"hours of patrol, assisted a beach-loving community with preventative actions and, of course,",199
NA,rescued those people in need. We are indebted to them for their service.,199
NA,"The clubhouse is used by a variety of community groups, including schools, hospitals and",199
NA,"sporting teams. We sincerely wish that this could continue, but unfortunately the failing state",199
NA,NA,199
NA,of repair and the decaying state of the clubhouse is making it very difficult for this community,200
NA,resource to be used by the people who need it and it may be lost. To address this an active,200
NA,"fundraising program is underway, but it remains a mighty challenge given the scale of the",200
NA,work needed. This is because the clubhouse at Black Rock was one of eight clubhouses listed,200
NA,as most in need of urgent renewal by the Life Saving Victoria statewide audit in 2011.,200
NA,Precious resources are being wasted as the decaying facilities are in constant need of repair.,200
NA,"The first aid room regularly floods, rendering it unfit for purpose. I have been down to the",200
NA,"Black Rock Life Saving Club; I have seen the state of the facilities, and it is truly appalling",200
NA,that people who are trying to save people's lives would have to put up with such,200
NA,circumstances.,200
NA,"Five years after the audit, the clubhouse renewal remains unfunded by the state",200
NA,"government, the Andrews government. The president of the club, Simon Tucker, like many,",200
NA,applauds the fact that some clubhouses have been renewed in that time and have been given,200
NA,injections of support to rebuild their facilities. But there is an issue in that there seems to be a,200
NA,very opaque process of allocation of these funds-not necessarily based on what is 'need' first,200
NA,and foremost.,200
NA,I was astounded the state government was funding solar panels for the existing,200
NA,"clubhouses-in fact, it has put some on the Black Rock Life Saving Club, even though the",200
NA,state of facilities is decaying and they need resources and money for the rebuilding of it. The,200
NA,"state government needs to take a hard look at its priorities, because when it comes down to it",200
NA,there is an absurdity to approving funding for installing solar panels on a decaying clubhouse,200
NA,that is in dire need of replacement when club volunteers cannot even use basic first aid,200
NA,facilities to the extent we need to make sure we can care for people. I genuinely hope that,200
NA,"common sense will be restored, and I can assure the Black Rock Life Saving Club that I will",200
NA,do anything to assist and work with them to fix the state of their clubhouse.,200
NA,"Gumana, Dr Gawirrin, AO",200
Mr SNOWDON ,"Lingiari) (10:49): Sadly, on 19 November this year, Dr Gumana AO",200
NA,passed away surrounded by his family and kinship at his homeland of Gangan in North-east,200
NA,Arnhem Land. He was a spiritual man whose life spanned the transition of his country from,200
NA,an exclusively Yolngu reality to the establishment of the Arnhem Land reserve and the birth,200
NA,of land rights. He is mourned by all Yolngu people of East Arnhem Land as the last of the,200
NA,"great lawmen in the area, but also as a humble, kind, patient, gentle and friendly man with a",200
NA,razor-sharp mind and a fierce resoluteness in the face of injustice. He was esteemed by all the,200
NA,"Balanda who knew him, and I was privileged to know him well.",200
NA,Dr Gumana spoke about a vengeance massacre of up to 30 of his people at Gangan when,200
NA,"he was a young boy. The young Dr Gumana suffered from Hansen's disease, or leprosy,",200
NA,"which caused him the loss of a majority of his fingers and toes, and he was sent to the",200
NA,Channel Island leprosarium at around the age of eight. This was a notorious prison-like,200
NA,"hellhole of depravation and neglect. Dr Gumana met and married his wife at Channel Island,",200
NA,learned English and became attracted to elements of Christian philosophy. He remained on,200
NA,"Channel Island for nine years, and his release may have coincided with the patient walk-off in",200
NA,"1946 in protest at the atrocious conditions. When he returned to Yirrkala, his discovered his",200
NA,"parents were not there. Undaunted, he paddled for over 20 days by dug-out canoe with a",200
NA,friend to be finally reunited with them at Numbulwar.,200
NA,NA,200
NA,Dr Gumana's life has been one of incredible courage and intellect. Following his return to,201
NA,"Yirrkala in the 50s, he acted as a bridge between the European missionaries and his people in",201
NA,"resolving philosophical, spiritual and practical issues which arose on a daily basis. In 1968, he",201
NA,assisted the Yirrkala people and acted as an interpreter when they took their protest over land,201
NA,to the courts. He acted as an interpreter and cultural bridge. He played a key part in the,201
NA,homeland movement of the 1970s in developing his homeland of Gangan. He worked closely,201
NA,with Lance Bennett and the Aboriginal Cultural Foundation in organising overseas dance,201
NA,troupes in 1982 and 1988. He was ordained a Uniting Church minister in November 1991.,201
NA,He said when awarded first prize in the 19th National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,201
NA,"Art Award in 2002, 'I did not make this larrakitj just for my community, but for the world, so",201
NA,that black and white can walk together.' He was a signatory of the Bark Petition-as a,201
NA,thumbprint annexure-in 1963. He was the last surviving artist of the world-renowned,201
NA,"Yirrkala Church Panels, also made in that year, which are housed in the Buku-Larrnggay",201
NA,"Mulka Art Centre, which he helped to start in 1976 and which still carries his design as its",201
NA,"logo. He was an artist of the Barunga Statement, which hangs in this Parliament House.",201
NA,"In May 2003, he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. He was a wonderful man,",201
NA,"and, when asked what else he would like said about him, he replied, 'Tell them I'm a man",201
NA,"from the bush.' He was a significant Australian, by any measure.",201
NA,Ryan Electorate: Disability Services,201
NA,Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan-Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services),201
NA,(10:53): I rise to speak on and recognise some of the truly remarkable community,201
NA,"organisations in my electorate of Ryan, providing support, friendship and inclusion to local",201
NA,residents with disability.,201
NA,"The first organisation, with which I recently met after attending their open day, is eWaste",201
NA,"Connection. Established by local constituent Monique Lowndes, eWaste Connection is",201
NA,"providing skills, support and friendship to their participants. eWaste Connection partners with",201
NA,"the Shed West Men's Shed, local schools and other community groups to dismantle and",201
NA,"recycle electronic waste including old computers, televisions or obsolete electrical equipment.",201
NA,"By partnering volunteer mentors with individuals with disability, eWaste Connection is",201
NA,"assisting people with disability to participate in meaningful work. Through this interaction,",201
NA,"individuals gain real world experience in work and developing social skills, while reducing",201
NA,the amount of electronic waste being disposed of as landfill.,201
NA,Another wonderful organisation in my electorate is the MCIntyre Centre. The MCIntyre,201
NA,"Centre, located at Bellbowrie, does amazing work in our community by providing weekly",201
NA,therapeutic equestrian sessions for around 200 young people and children with disabilities.,201
NA,"Established in 1964, the centre provides a range of activities and support services for these",201
NA,young people and their families and also receives incredible backing from the community. It,201
NA,"was estimated that in 2014-15 more than 10,800 hours were contributed by volunteers to the",201
NA,successful running of the centre. With figures like this it is no wonder the MCIntyre Centre is,201
NA,"always on the lookout for more volunteers to assist in grooming and feeding the horses, lesson",201
NA,assistance and the sorting of donations for MCIntyre thrift shops whose profits help fund the,201
NA,therapeutic sessions. The MCIntyre Centre is an integral part of our community and draws,201
NA,individuals from all parts of Brisbane. They continue to enhance the lives of these special,201
NA,young people and help them and their families thrive in these programs. Acknowledgement,201
NA,NA,201
NA,must also go to the countless hours of volunteer support provided by many dedicated locals,202
NA,who simply want to give back to the community and see the smile on someone else's face.,202
NA,"Recently, I was delighted to officially open HELP Enterprises' new office at Mitchelton.",202
NA,HELP provides innovative employment and training models to support job seekers with,202
NA,disability. I am very proud to have such an enthusiastic organisation with a dedicated,202
NA,commitment to disability employment services in my electorate of Ryan.,202
NA,"Sadly, there are some people who would not give the slightest consideration to these",202
NA,organisations and those of similar ilk. But for those with disability fortunate enough to,202
NA,"participate, these community organisations are providing hope to what are challenging lives.",202
NA,It is not just about recycling e-waste or riding lessons; it is offering support and inclusion to,202
NA,those in our communities with disability. (Time expired),202
NA,Bass Electorate: Launceston Sewerage Improvement Project,202
Mr HART ,Bass) (10:56): Launceston's combined sewerage system dates back to the,202
NA,1860s. It is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of the growing Launceston community. Just,202
NA,33 per cent of waste water plants met their environmental licence in 2015. Without a modern,202
NA,"standard tertiary treatment plant water quality will not improve, the environment will continue",202
NA,to be degraded and the health and safety of Launceston residents will continue to suffer.,202
NA,"Before the last election, TasWater guaranteed $400 million over 10 years to a $1.8 billion",202
NA,"upgrade of Tasmania's water infrastructure, with the project contingent upon external funding.",202
NA,I am proud that I was able to seek a commitment from federal Labor to provide $75 million,202
NA,for the extensive works required to consolidate an upgrade to Launceston's water and,202
NA,"sewerage infrastructure. I said at the time that it was important to make a start, despite the fact",202
NA,that the capital requirement was very significant and the project would take many years to,202
NA,"complete. Indeed, the Launceston Sewerage Improvement Project is one of the largest urban",202
NA,infrastructure projects ever undertaken in Tasmania. Infrastructure Australia has,202
NA,independently assessed the project as a priority. I am of the view that it would be inequitable,202
NA,for the burden of such a significant capital project to fall purely upon the ratepayers of,202
NA,Tasmania.,202
NA,The failure of the Turnbull government to act on this project and commit to the necessary,202
NA,infrastructure funding is putting at risk the Tamar River environment and the health and safety,202
NA,of Tasmanian communities. So while I am pleased that the Turnbull government has,202
NA,"committed $1.5 million for the Tamar River Recovery Plan, it is less than a drop in the river",202
NA,"for what is actually required. This so-called plan is meant to improve water quality, while raw",202
NA,sewage continues to pour into the river. Prime Minister Turnbull needs to stop dragging his,202
NA,heels. This 156-year-old sewer needs to be upgraded now.,202
NA,This is not to mention the four new Green Army projects that promote exploitation of,202
NA,"young Tasmanians, paying them much less than the minimum wage. They are not even",202
NA,legally workers and they have no workplace rights. The Turnbull government expects us to be,202
NA,excited that instead of these people enrolling in continued education and training or looking,202
NA,"for work, they are forcing our young people to perform manual work for less than award rates.",202
NA,So whilst I welcome the government's commitment in this area I question their commitment,202
NA,to genuine improvements to the river. Only Labor had the strategic infrastructure plan for,202
NA,northern Tasmania and particularly for my electorate of Bass.,202

NA,Berowra Electorate: Hornsby North Public School,203
Mr LEESER ,Berowra) (10:58): I rise today to congratulate Hornsby North Public,203
NA,School on their 50th anniversary. I was very pleased to be able to attend the school's 50th,203
NA,"anniversary assembly and celebrations on 18 November, when the school community came",203
NA,together to celebrate the history and the future of the school. It was fantastic to join such a,203
NA,"warm and welcoming community of parents, teachers, friends and students. The first school",203
NA,visit I did after being elected as the member for Berowra was to open the Hornsby North,203
NA,"Public School art fair, so I have a great connection with the school.",203
NA,The school was built in 1966 in response to the residential expansion in the area of,203
NA,"Hornsby following the bushfires of 1957, which caused damage to the existing Hornsby",203
NA,school. The first day of the school for 90 excited students and four staff was 31 January 1967.,203
NA,"The school quickly became a hub for the local community, bringing together young families",203
NA,"who were new to the area and providing the foundation for strong, long-lasting community",203
NA,relationships.,203
NA,"A very active group of local parents established the Parents and Citizens Association and,",203
NA,"in the early days, they established the annual school fund-raising event of barbecue and",203
NA,"fireworks on cracker night in June. The fireworks became very popular, organised by Howard",203
NA,"& Sons Pyrotechnics, attracting up to 2,000 people from across the district. From these early",203
NA,"foundations in the sixties and seventies the school quickly developed and grew, adding",203
NA,"classrooms, a library block, a school hall and other buildings to cater for a growing number of",203
NA,young families in the local area. Today the strong community spirit of Hornsby North remains,203
NA,a strong driving force behind the school.,203
NA,Several of the original parents have seen their grandchildren-and some great,203
NA,grandchildren-now attend school. Hornsby North has educated the great grandchildren of,203
NA,the original orchard owners of the area that the school was built on and there is a special,203
NA,group of former school students who have joined the staff. The Hornsby area continues to,203
NA,"attract new young families. They are attracted by the outstanding educational experience, the",203
NA,"band, the choir and the exceptional principal, Maree Sumpton. They are also attracted by the",203
NA,"spirit of diversity in the school, most notably on display during the international food fair,",203
NA,which provides the foundation for Hornsby's annual autumn fare.,203
NA,Throughout the school's history its parent body has been partner in the school's,203
NA,development and success. I congratulate the Parents and Citizens Association for its,203
NA,"remarkable contribution to the school, led by the current president, Kath Millar, and its former",203
NA,"president, Lynne Slevin. I also want to acknowledge a number of the parents who have been",203

NA,Macarthur Electorate: Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation,204
Dr FREELANDER ,Macarthur) (11:01): Today I would like to speak about an iconic,204
NA,"community organisation in my electorate of Macarthur, the Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation.",204
NA,Tharawal is an Aboriginal community controlled medical and health-care service that is,204
NA,unlike any other health-care service in this country. It has been marvelled at and visited by,204
NA,"people such as Sir Michael Marmot, head of the World Medical Association and the World",204
NA,"Health Organization's chair of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health, who said",204
NA,"that Tharawal was making the fantasy of a fairer distribution of power, money and resources a",204
NA,"reality. It uses community empowerment, a community controlling the services needed for its",204
NA,"population, to improve things for its own community and for others.",204
NA,"As we know, there are major discrepancies between Indigenous and non-Indigenous health",204
NA,"in Australia. We constantly hear of the shorter life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher",204
NA,drug and alcohol use and poorer overall health. But what we often do not hear are the success,204
NA,"stories, and Tharawal is a remarkable success story. It is simply inspiring. It is led by Daryl",204
NA,"Wright and a proactive board, all from the local Indigenous community. Over 14,000 people",204
NA,"use the services provided by Tharawal, including: medical, specialist and dental services;",204
NA,"child and family services, such as maternal and child health and parenting programs; social",204
NA,"and emotional wellbeing services; and healthy-living services, such as tackling Indigenous",204
NA,"smoking, the good tucker program and the Lyrebird exercise program.",204
NA,Tharawal places a high emphasis on education and uses education to give many,204
NA,"disadvantaged children hope. Tharawal is located next to John Warby Public School, one of",204
NA,the most disadvantaged schools in New South Wales. It works with the school to provide,204
NA,extensive educational support. It also works with incarcerated Indigenous children in the,204
NA,"Reiby juvenile detention centre, a short distance away.",204
NA,"Tharawal is providing support services for university students, from six universities-in",204
NA,"medicine, nursing, allied health and education-to do their practical work. Tharawal has plans",204
NA,"to grow its service. However, there has recently been a plan put forward by the New South",204
NA,"Wales government to reduce the land that the Tharawal Corporation leases, consequently",204
NA,"isolating Tharawal from the community it serves. This plan is short-sighted and, once again,",204
NA,puts short-term financial gains ahead of long-term community benefits.,204
NA,Tharawal is an organisation we need to foster and promote-not tear down. Services need,204
NA,to continue and be improved. We need to empower people and both major political parties,204
NA,"need to have a commitment to protecting and improving Tharawal, which is an invaluable",204
NA,community institution.,204
NA,Swan Electorate: Roads,204
Mr IRONS ,Swan) (11:04): I rise today to provide the House with an update on the,204
NA,"Manning Road on-ramp, which has been an important local issue in my electorate of Swan for",204
NA,"many years. In fact, it has been a project that has been discussed since the 1980s. When I",204
NA,"became the local federal member for Swan in 2007, constituents began to express their",204
NA,frustration with the lack of an on-ramp at Manning Road to take the traffic south on Kwinana,204
NA,"Freeway. In 2009, I did a survey and I received over 1,000 responses with almost unanimous",204
NA,"support for the project. As a result, I have continued to campaign for the people of Swan for",204
NA,the provision of a southbound access to the freeway on Manning Road.,204
NA,NA,204
NA,"To provide some background for the House, Manning Road connects Albany Highway to",205
NA,the Kwinana Freeway in the southern part of my electorate. It is not only used by thousands of,205
NA,my constituents but by the broader population of Perth. It is also a key road to Curtin,205
NA,"University, which boasts of an enrolment of nearly 40,000 at the Bentley Campus, and is used",205
NA,"by many others on their daily commute to the city. However, the real issue is that anybody",205
NA,needing to join the Kwinana Freeway and head south from Manning Road is currently,205
NA,"required to navigate a complex stretch of road, do a circle around the freeway which involves",205
NA,"heading northwards, merging and then a lane change back across the Canning bridge. You",205
NA,then have to merge with the traffic coming off the freeway to get back onto the freeway. It is,205
NA,"the cause of immense frustration, but it is also a very dangerous stretch of road in our great",205
NA,state of Western Australia.,205
NA,"In addition to this, the on-ramp is more urgent than ever to ensure ease of access to the new",205
NA,"Fiona Stanley Hospital, with increased demand from patients needing to head south to attend",205
NA,"the hospital or the ED. In November last year, I took the Prime Minister to Manning Road,",205
NA,and he said he could see the need for an on-ramp and that heading south is currently quite an,205
NA,"elaborate exercise. And then, only a few months on, this government committed to help fund",205
NA,"the Manning Road on-ramp. The need for the on-ramp seems blatantly obvious, unfortunately",205
NA,"though, Labor has not supported this. When former member for Perth, Alannah MACTiernan,",205
NA,"was a WA minister for planning and infrastructure, she rejected the on-ramp project.",205
NA,"Similarly, Senator Sue Lines, with a seat in the Senate, certainly does not start her list of",205
NA,priorities with it.,205
NA,The coalition has listened to the community and committed to this funding during the,205
NA,"election. Last week, I met with the Western Australian state minister for transport, Bill",205
NA,"Marmion, to discuss the state's share of funding and a potential time line for the project. I look",205
NA,"forward to further updating the House and the residents of Swan on this project, and would",205
NA,like to thank all the residents of Swan who have inquired about this project and continue to,205
NA,support it not only through sending their messages of support but also by continuing to vote,205
NA,for the coalition at both the federal and state elections. Thank you.,205
NA,Hunter Electorate: Broadband,205
Mr FITZGIBBON ,"Hunter) (11:07): Very sadly, the divide between city and country in",205
NA,"this nation is growing. It is growing in health, education, government service delivery,",205
NA,"infrastructure and, of course, broadband services. This is the legacy of three years under this",205
NA,coalition government.,205
NA,"In my own electorate, constituents fall into one of five categories. Some have an inferior",205
NA,"copper-based NBN, which they often say is slower and less reliable than their old ADSL2",205
NA,"service. Further, many lost their landlines for protracted periods during the switchover, and",205
NA,many still report voice phone dropouts on a regular basis. This problem is most prominent,205
NA,around the townships of Lake Macquarie. The second category are those still waiting for a,205
NA,second-rate NBN and cannot secure an ADSL2 service because Telstra says it does not make,205
NA,the investment because the NBN will come one day. The third category includes those who,205
NA,"are receiving fixed wireless. I have to say, pleasingly, I have had few complaints about the",205
NA,"fixed wireless service but, of course, too few residents have access to it.",205
NA,The fourth group are those who can hope for no coverage other than satellite but are told,205
NA,they do not qualify for satellite. The fifth group have a problem in common with farmers and,205
NA,NA,205
NA,rural residents right across this nation: they have a satellite service which costs more and is,206
NA,inferior to the services enjoyed by those who live in our capital cities. While those in the cities,206
NA,"are spoilt with choice, including options of limitless download capacity for less than $90 a",206
NA,"month, the average Sky Muster satellite customer is forced to pay $135 per month for 55",206
NA,gigabytes of download between 7 am and 1 am. Many have no choice but to turn to very,206
NA,expensive wi-fi options to keep their farms running.,206
NA,Rural and remote families face being put on expensive data rations when they connect to,206
NA,the National Broadband Network. Two Sky Muster satellites are the only option for those,206
NA,who live beyond the reach of the NBN fixed wireless tower. Action group Better Internet for,206
NA,"Rural, Regional and Remote Australia surveyed 750 Sky Muster customers, with 60 per cent",206
NA,saying the satellites did not meet their data needs and 86 per cent that they had connection,206
NA,issues.,206
NA,In the 21st century access to broadband is not a want; it is a need. Much of our farm,206
NA,equipment now relies on connection to broadband services. This is putting our agriculture,206
NA,sector at an international economic disadvantage. This government with its inferior NBN,206
NA,service is letting rural Australia down and it is letting our farmers down.,206
NA,Surrogacy,206
Mr BROAD ,Mallee) (11:10): I wish to talk on an issue that is a little bit sensitive and a,206
NA,"little bit controversial. Children, of course, are a gift and the ability to have a family is",206
NA,"something that we all aspire to. For some-myself included-it eludes us, and then we look at",206
NA,fostering and other things.,206
NA,We support people who want to endeavour to have children through IVF. We have a legal,206
NA,framework around surrogacy. I want to touch on offshore surrogacy. Australian law allows,206
NA,for a surrogate mother in Australia to be a surrogate mother but certainly not to receive a,206
NA,"commercial benefit from doing so. Three of our states-New South Wales, the ACT and",206
NA,"Queensland-currently essentially stop, or make illegal, offshore surrogacy.",206
NA,"If a law protects a citizen of Australia because of a principle that we believe in, I believe",206
NA,the principle should run through so that a woman who is not an Australian citizen is also to be,206
NA,protected under Australian law. As we think through the issue of offshore surrogacy we are,206
NA,"bound by focus on the rights of the child, by our human rights agreements, but there does not",206
NA,appear to be enough talk about the rights of the surrogate mother. I think this is a space that,206
NA,we need to have a very real discussion in.,206
NA,Australia is one of the most active countries in the world for surrogacy and for some this,206
NA,has delivered a beautiful child for their family. My fear is that the paying of money to a,206
NA,"surrogate mother in a poor country has the risk of serious exploitation, in recognition of the",206
NA,fact that that woman is not protected by Australian law. It has the risk of pressures upon that,206
NA,"woman. It has the risk of major exploitation of that woman, including whether, in some",206
NA,"instances, she actually gets paid. There is a real discussion to be had around how we, as the",206
NA,"Australian government, ensure that if surrogacy is going to take place, and it is taking place,",206
NA,we protect the surrogate mothers in those poor countries.,206
NA,We are all putting our hands on our hearts today and talking about White Ribbon Day and,206
NA,support for women in domestic violence situations. But the principle has to run true that we,206
NA,have to find a way of ensuring that Australian law protects a surrogate mother. We can do,206
NA,NA,206
NA,this. We do this with paedophilia overseas. We prosecute if someone partakes in something,207
NA,that is against our principles overseas. I think there is a real discussion to be had on this. It is,207
NA,something we should tackle. It is something that average Australians think we can do better,207
NA,on.,207
NA,Paterson Electorate: Lions Club of Raymond Terrace,207
Ms SWANSON ,"Paterson) (11:13): Today, I would like to pay tribute to some members",207
NA,"of my community in Paterson who are truly deserving of recognition. Last Saturday, I was",207
NA,honoured to give the toast to the Lions Club of Raymond Terrace as they celebrated their 60th,207
NA,"birthday. The international Lions Club has 45,000 members, and it is always inspiring to",207
NA,spend time with people who are in service to others. The Lions Club of Raymond Terrace was,207
NA,formed in September 1956 and has given countless hours in the service of our town and,207
NA,"community, whether it be at the driver reviver-when people pull over in the busy times of",207
NA,"Easter or Christmas, which gives them a chance to have a cuppa and refresh-or providing",207
NA,funds to many worthwhile causes.,207
NA,"In 2015 alone, they provided a portable ultrasound machine for the Mater Hospital's",207
NA,"oncology unit and contributed a donation of $100,000 to people affected by the flooding in",207
NA,Dungog-a sizeable amount of money for such a small group of people. Lions also support,207
NA,"young people and, as a former Lions Youth of the Year, I can attest to the skills and",207
NA,"experience that that fantastic arrangement gives to young people, such as I was in the eighties.",207
NA,"When we lead such busy lives, it is important to recognise an organisation that fosters service",207
NA,to others. Thank you to the Lions Club of Raymond Terrace.,207
NA,I would also like to congratulate and wish a hearty bon voyage to some young Maitland,207
NA,soccer players and their parents who are off to Amiens in France on Friday. The busload will,207
NA,leave their home ground in East Maitland on a pilgrimage to mark the route their forefathers,207
NA,"took 100 years ago, when Maitland's own 34th Battalion set out in 1916 to fight World War I.",207
NA,The 34th Battalion of coalfield lads and Maitland boys did us proud on the battlefields of the,207
NA,"Western Front, receiving commendation for their valour. Apparently they also did us proud",207
NA,on the soccer field in a historic match between the 34th Battalion and the French aerodrome,207
NA,team of Amiens. The 17-year-old boys from my home town of Maitland and the coalfields,207
NA,will recreate that match. Congratulations to Ian Mather and his team for organising a trip of a,207
NA,"lifetime to mark the sacrifice of a lifetime. Last week, I presented the players with Australian",207
NA,flags to take to Amiens and I could not help but look at their young faces and think back to,207
NA,"the young faces of those boys we sent to war 100 years ago, and the men and women who go",207
NA,"to war for us today. On that note, I would like to send my sincere thanks to our Defence",207
NA,personnel serving overseas this Christmas. We are incredibly proud and grateful for what you,207
NA,do. (Time expired),207
NA,Country to Canberra 2016,207
NA,"Mrs SUDMALIS (Gilmore) (11:16): Yesterday, a number of quite inspiring young",207
NA,women gathered in parliament to meet their MPs. They were the winners of the Country to,207
NA,Canberra 2016 leadership competition. This is an Australian not-for-profit organisation that,207
NA,"empowers young women from regional, remote and rural areas to reach their full potential",207
NA,through a nationwide leadership competition based around gender equality for high school,207
NA,"students in regional areas. Winners have their work published, are awarded a trip to Canberra,",207
NA,"get to meet influential role models and politicians, connect with mentors through the raising",207
NA,NA,207
NA,Hope Foundation and participate in public speaking and leadership training. I was introduced,208
NA,"to Elise Toyer, who is only 16 years old and is currently in year 10 at St Peter's Anglican",208
NA,"College in Broulee but actually lives in Batemans Bay. Her role model is her Tia, her father's",208
NA,"mother. Elise is passionate about achieving healthcare equality within Australia, particularly",208
NA,"in rural and remote areas, and would like to become a rural and regional paediatric specialist",208
NA,after she finishes high school.,208
NA,Elise is a vivacious and enthusiastic young woman with a contagious personality. I asked,208
NA,her to send me a copy of her winning entry and the following are her words which she,208
NA,"presented in an empathic and powerful video, especially relevant as we emphasise White",208
NA,Ribbon Day this week:,208
NA,Why is gender equality important to me and my community? This is my friend and I proudly laying a,208
NA,wreath on behalf of our local scout group at Anzac Day last year. We were introduced as representatives,208
NA,of the Boy Scouts Association of Australia.,208
NA,The only problem? We're both girls. That man that introduced us did something we all do-myself,208
NA,included. We attribute certain qualities to a particular gender. The typical view of a woman is meek and,208
NA,"humble, submissive and emotional. A man is strong and tough, emotionless. But these stereotypical",208
NA,"labels that are doled out to us are not a gift, they are a burden; a heavy weight that limits our potential.",208
NA,"For gender equality to occur, we must see past the gender labels given to a person and see their qualities",208
NA,not as female and male but as human.,208
NA,Gender equality means that when the young women in my community become leaders in their,208
NA,"schools and workplaces, they are not bossy or rude but confident, strong leaders. As Beyonce said, 'I'm",208
NA,not bossy … I'm the boss.' And when the young men in my community have had a tough week and are,208
NA,"struggling to see the light in each day, they know it's okay to ask for help, to talk and to hug. To know",208
NA,that it's okay not to be okay.,208
NA,"Gender equality means to me that when I'm a scout and I am out there leading in the community, it's",208
NA,not automatically thought that I belong to a boy's group because those qualities are for men-I belong,208
NA,to Scouts. Because women and men can be both strong and humble and kind and confident.,208
NA,The qualities that make a person aren't male or female-they're human and that's why gender,208
NA,equality is important to me and my community.,208
NA,"Elise, you are wonderful. Thank you. (Time expired)",208
NA,Australian Men's Shed Association,208
Mr KHALIL ,Wills) (11:20): I want to acknowledge the work of the Australian Men's,208
NA,"Shed Association and, in particular, all the men's sheds in my electorate of Wills. We are all",208
NA,familiar with men's sheds and the good work that they do. They are community spaces,208
NA,"modelled after the old-fashioned backyard shed, but not all men's sheds are the same.",208
NA,"Depending on which shed you visit, you may see a number of blokes making furniture or",208
NA,perhaps restoring bicycles for a local school. They could be making bird traps or fixing,208
NA,lawnmowers or making a cubbyhouse for Camp Quality to raffle. You often see a few young,208
NA,"men as well, working with the older men, learning new skills and learning something about",208
NA,life from the men that they work with. You might also see local elders making traditional arts,208
NA,and crafts. You will usually see teabags and coffee cups strewn about in a comfortable area,208
NA,where men can just sit and talk. You will probably see an area where men can learn to cook,208
NA,"for themselves, or even contact family members by computer.",208
NA,NA,208
NA,Many men struggle to talk about their feelings and their emotions. They do not really take a,209
NA,"serious interest in their own mental health. According to beyondblue, one in eight men will",209
NA,have depression and one in five men will experience anxiety at some stage of their lives.,209
NA,"While women are statistically more likely to experience depression and anxiety, men are less",209
NA,likely to talk about it. Depression is a serious and common condition which will not get better,209
NA,by itself. But some men are still subscribing to the idea that they should just tough it out and,209
NA,"be self-reliant in any and all circumstances. It is said that because of this, some males are",209
NA,"known to drink more and take more risks with their health, and can suffer immensely from a",209
NA,"lack of appropriate treatment. Good health is based on many factors, including feeling good",209
NA,"about yourself, being productive, contributing to your community, connecting with friends",209
NA,and maintaining an active body and mind. Professor Barry Golding from Federation,209
NA,"University, in an address to the 2007 men's shed conference, said:",209
NA,"Men don't talk face to face, they talk shoulder to shoulder.",209
NA,This is the real power of the men's shed. Your local shed provides a safe and busy,209
NA,"environment where men can find many of these things, in an atmosphere of old-fashioned",209
NA,mateship.,209
NA,"In Wills, there is already an excellent men's shed in the suburb of Glenroy. I recently met",209
NA,with a group of blokes from Fawkner who are working on the establishment of a men's shed,209
NA,in their area. These guys have been trying to establish a Fawkner men's shed for years. I,209
NA,"visited them on a vacant plot of land on Lorne Street in Fawkner, and they told me all about",209
NA,their plans that were already underway. The first project that these guys will have is actually,209
NA,building the shed. I will be backing their bid to get the men's shed up and running in Fawkner.,209
NA,I encourage everyone to get involved in their local men's shed by visiting the Men's Shed,209
NA,Association website for more information.,209
NA,Logan Urban Design Awards,209
NA,Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (11:22): It is my pleasure to rise in this,209
NA,House today and speak about the achievements of various entities around Logan City in the,209
NA,"Logan Urban Design Awards. The 2016 Logan Urban Design Awards were held recently, and",209
NA,"I would like to congratulate the overall winner, the Beenleigh Artisan Distillery's new visitor",209
NA,"centre. Held every two years, the LUDA awards promote excellence in the design and",209
NA,"creation of urban environments, large and small, within the City of Logan. The award winners",209
NA,"across all categories are chosen for their clever design, delivering excellent community spaces",209
NA,"that, in some cases, also put a unique twist on conventional buildings. Beenleigh Artisan",209
NA,Distillery's new visitor centre was named the overall winner for its striking modern cellar door,209
NA,"design, introduced to the distillery's entrance by Blueprint Architects. The design was praised",209
NA,"for re-imagining the iconic Beenleigh business, while also respecting its heritage-and for the",209
NA,benefit of those in the House: it is the oldest operating rum distillery in Australia. The judges',209
NA,"comments said it was 'a project that exemplifies the value and contribution of good design,'",209
NA,and that the project's 'adaptive and contemporary design unites old and new to breathe fresh,209
NA,life into this Beenleigh business icon'.,209
NA,"The Logan Urban Design Awards covered four categories: the Master Planning Award,",209
NA,awarded to master-planned developments and communities; the Landscape Architecture and,209
NA,"Urban Infrastructure Award; the Architecture Award, awarded to exemplar building-form",209
NA,"projects covering residential, commercial, industrial and institutional; and the Business and",209
NA,NA,209
NA,"Events Award, awarded to exemplar businesses, programs or events that contribute our",210
NA,community.,210
NA,"I would like to congratulate all the winners, as well as the nominees, on their commitment",210
NA,"to quality design and development within the city of Logan, including: the Master Planning",210
NA,"Award winner, My Home and The River Estate; the Landscape Architecture and Urban",210
NA,"Infrastructure Award winner, Jimboomba Community Garden; Architecture Award winner,",210
NA,"MCDonalds Underwood and Landini Associates; and the Business and Events Award winner,",210
NA,Extraction Artisan Coffee at Springwood. Those receiving commendation awards were: the,210
NA,"Early Bird Breakfast Markets, Cavern Music Concerts, the Rum Rump and Rumba Festival",210
NA,"2015, and The Vicker Ridge. Congratulations to everybody involved for the tremendous work",210
NA,of continuing to build and grow our magnificent community.,210
NA,Corio Electorate: Medicare,210
Mr MARLES ,Corio) (11:25): The ongoing freeze of the Medicare rebate has driven up,210
NA,"the cost of primary health care across Australia. That is being felt by many Australians, who",210
NA,"expressed their voices in huge numbers at the last election. In my electorate of Corio, it is",210
NA,"estimated that 12,000 people put off going to the doctor today because of the cost of primary",210
NA,"health care and 15,000 people put off gaining their prescriptions because of the costs",210
NA,"associated with that. Those numbers are most significant in the northern part of my electorate,",210
NA,in the northern suburbs of Geelong-Norlane and Corio-where health needs are at their,210
NA,"most complex. It is in this part of my electorate that we see the highest rates of diabetes, for",210
NA,example. Diseases of poverty are most prevalent there. The refugee populations in my,210
NA,electorate are most concentrated in that part of it. Their health needs are particularly acute. Dr,210
NA,"Mark Kennedy, who runs the Corio Medical Clinic, says:",210
NA,We have more cases of diabetes coming into our clinic than anywhere else in the country. Our clinic,210
NA,and the public in Geelong's Northern suburbs have got long term benefits out of the former Labor,210
NA,government's Primary Care Infrastructure grants; they allowed us to expand and teach new GPs and,210
NA,medical students that are working across the country today.,210
NA,Dr Abbas Mahmood from the Corio Bay Medical Centre says:,210
NA,Refugees have a greater need for health care and life support infrastructure and a collaborative approach,210
NA,by doctor services will be better able to … support them.,210
NA,"Dr Ganes Kunjidapaadhum, who runs the First Point Medical Centre, says:",210
NA,Instead of taking away doctors and health assets it's time the government starts adding doctors and,210
NA,health services dependent on what the public needs.,210
NA,"On 15 November-last Tuesday-I called a meeting of those three doctors, who between",210
NA,"them cater to about 80 to 90 per cent of the primary health care needs in the north of Geelong,",210
NA,to talk about ways in which they could better coordinate and ways in which we could use,210
NA,them as a voice for the medical needs of the north of Geelong. There was a real sense of,210
NA,"excitement amongst them about working together. There is an opportunity, I think, for them",210
NA,"to work more closely and to coordinate their resources around, for example, servicing those",210
NA,refugees in the north of Geelong who need medical assistance. Operating with the council is,210
NA,"also something which I think they can do better as a group, making sure that overseas doctors",210
NA,who come to Geelong are able to operate in the northern suburbs. This is an important forum.,210
NA,"Along with Jason Trethowan, the CEO of the Western Victoria Primary Health Network, we",210
NA,are really excited about the opportunity it presents. (Time expired),210

Ms FLINT ,Boothby) (11:28): This year marks the 125th anniversary of the Belair,211
NA,National Park. I would like to thank all the dedicated volunteers who give their time to care,211
NA,for what is a really wonderful natural and historical resource in my electorate. The park is,211
NA,"nestled in the start of the Mount Lofty Ranges, and it is the second-oldest national park in",211
NA,"Australia. It attracts 250,000 visitors a year. It was created in 1891, when the state of South",211
NA,Australia was only 55 years old. It is also the sixth-oldest national park in the world.,211
NA,The success of Belair National Park is testament to its value to the community. More than,211
NA,"just a protected green space, it has great public utility and is saturated with South Australian",211
NA,"history dating right back to 1837, which is only a year after our state proclamation. The park",211
NA,"is complete with ovals, pavilions, tennis courts, barbecues and picnic areas and is a hive of",211
NA,"activity for families on the weekends. For those who wish to explore the park's natural beauty,",211
NA,"there are a variety of trails suitable for all, from novice walkers up to veteran hikers. While",211
NA,"keeping fit and healthy, walkers can marvel at the waterfalls along the aptly named Echo",211
NA,"Track to the north, or make their way south along Valley Road up to Amphitheatre Rock. For",211
NA,"lovers of history and politics like myself, Belair National Park is also home to the summer",211
NA,residence of former South Australian governors. The residence is a magnificent Victorian,211
NA,"mansion which boasts the state's first indoor swimming pool, which is quite a sight to see. I",211
NA,"was there to see it myself in early March, which was the launch of the park's birthday",211
NA,"celebrations. For a gold-coin donation, the Friends of Old Government House happily conduct",211
NA,tours of this wonderful historical site for tourists and the public.,211
NA,The Friends of Old Government House is just one of the many community groups who,211
NA,"devote their time to maintaining the Belair National Park, which covers 835 hectares in total.",211
NA,The Friends of Belair National Park is another one of these volunteer groups involved with,211
NA,"the park. They are a committed group that I have had the pleasure of being a member of, and",211
NA,"they do a huge amount of work, from weeding and bushland protection to hosting visitors and",211
NA,"taking tours of the park, and letting people know about the wonderful flora and fauna that we",211
NA,have. We in Adelaide are lucky to have such a space only 13 kilometres from the city centre.,211
NA,"It is right on our doorstep. In this, the 125th year of Belair National Park, I pay tribute to all of",211
NA,"those who make the park the wonderful place that it is, and I encourage all South Australians",211
NA,and visitors to South Australia to visit the park on 3 December for the end of the 125th,211
NA,birthday celebrations. I cannot commend it highly enough.,211
The DEPUTY SPEAKER ," Mrs Wicks): In accordance with standing order 193, the time",211
NA,for members' constituency statements has concluded.,211
NA,MOTIONS,211
NA,Equal Rights,211
NA,Consideration resumed of the motion:,211
NA,That this House:,211
NA,(1) reaffirms its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with,211
NA,"equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin;",211
NA,(2) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non-discriminatory on,211
NA,"grounds of race, colour, creed or origin;",211
NA,NA,211
NA,(3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait,212
NA,"Islander people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage;",212
NA,"(4) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open",212
NA,"society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values;",212
NA,and,212
NA,(5) denounces racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are and,212
NA,want to be.,212
Mr BURKE ,Watson-Manager of Opposition Business) (11:32): My feelings are very,212
NA,"mixed, standing to speak on this motion today. It is a motion which was first moved in the",212
NA,parliament 20 years ago. It was moved at the time that One Nation first entered the House of,212
NA,"Representatives; moved by the then Prime Minister, John Howard and supported by the then",212
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley.",212
NA,"On the first day of the new parliament, Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, put to",212
NA,the Prime Minister that it was time to carry this motion again. The intention was that carrying,212
NA,the motion would be an affirmation of principles that would be unanimously held across,212
NA,"parliament. And the Prime Minister, in good faith, took that offer on and made the motion his",212
NA,own. By the time we vote on this-either later today or tomorrow-it is hard to believe that,212
NA,this motion is still supported by every member of the House of Representatives. The second,212
NA,paragraph of the motion-of a 20-year-old motion-says that the House:,212
NA,reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non-discriminatory on grounds,212
NA,"of race, colour, creed or origin.",212
NA,It simply cannot be the case that every member of the parliament still believes that. I have no,212
NA,doubt that this motion reflects the majority view of our parliament. But I cannot reconcile that,212
NA,second paragraph with the words that we have heard in recent days from Australia's Minister,212
NA,"for Immigration, when he put the argument not that the Fraser government let the wrong",212
NA,people in but that the people who were let in had children and grandchildren who have,212
NA,behaved in an unacceptable way-and therefore used the phrase that the government had,212
NA,"'made a mistake'. The only point of continuity with those people was that they, being the",212
NA,"grandchildren of the people who came through under the Fraser government, were of the",212
NA,"same race, were of the same ethnicity and adhered to the same creed. There is no way of",212
NA,reconciling the words of the minister for immigration with the words of this motion. I wish,212
NA,there were.,212
NA,"I want this resolution, which is about who we are as a country, to be something that both",212
NA,sides of politics can unanimously agree on. When the Leader of the Opposition put this,212
NA,"motion forward and said it is time to move it again, it was not intended to be a wedge through",212
NA,the government. It was not intended to be a point of division; it was intended to be a statement,212
NA,"of unity. I cannot, for the life of me, see how that second paragraph of this resolution can in",212
NA,any way be reconciled with the views that the minister for immigration has now put forward.,212
NA,"In those views that the minister for immigration has put forward, he has connected issues",212
NA,"of race, ethnicity and religion with crime. This part of the language is not new. Back when we",212
NA,"had a debate in the 1980s about whether Asian immigration should be held back, the language",212
NA,"at the time was about triad gangs, Asian gangs and gangs in Cabramatta. In the sixties and",212
NA,"seventies, when people were arguing about whether or not Italian immigration was",212
NA,"appropriate, the language then was about the links to the Mafia and about crime. I do not",212
NA,NA,212
NA,accept for one minute that the serious issues of national security that we are dealing with are,213
NA,an excuse to legitimise the racial profiling of a community based on its children and,213
NA,grandchildren.,213
NA,I support this motion because I support its principles and the way they define our nation. I,213
NA,genuinely believe that there is a majority of members in the government who believe and,213
NA,support every clause of this motion. I have no doubt whatsoever that what has been put,213
NA,forward by the minister for immigration is damaging and no better than those arguments that,213
NA,were put forward 20 years ago opposing Asian immigration or those arguments that were put,213
NA,forward in the sixties and seventies opposing migration of Greeks and Italians.,213
NA,I have no doubt that the comments from the minister for immigration will win him votes. I,213
NA,do not care! There has to be a time when we are willing to provide a level of leadership to,213
NA,bring a country together. I expect the comments from the minister for immigration will not,213
NA,"result in any change of immigration policy. He will hint at it and he will tempt at it, but I",213
NA,suspect the policy will not in fact change. I suspect also that it will not add a single job to,213
NA,Australia nor a dollar to our GDP. But I know some things that it will do. It will make the,213
NA,work of our security agencies harder. It will cause people to feel marginalised when we want,213
NA,"them to feel 100 per cent part of our community. It will cause some people, a small minority,",213
NA,"to have a sense of licence and permission to belittle and abuse some of their fellow citizens,",213
NA,and that has already commenced.,213
NA,There are two sorts of Australian stories: an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander story that,213
NA,"goes all the way back to the first sunrise, and a story of immigration. Every Australian either",213
NA,has one or both of those stories. Modern Australia is about bringing those 24 million stories,213
NA,together. That is what it is. Part of the role of the minister for immigration is making sure that,213
NA,we are as cohesive as possible in making sure that people who might feel marginalised in fact,213
NA,feel every word that is in our citizenship oath.,213
NA,I do not want there to be partisanship in a motion like this. The reason it was brought,213
NA,forward was that we believed at the time that we would have a unanimous statement from the,213
NA,parliament that would ostracise some of the voices that have come into the other place and,213
NA,"make clear that, while they have been given a really loud microphone, they do not represent",213
NA,"the majority of this parliament, they do not represent the story of bipartisan support for",213
NA,"modern, multicultural Australia.",213
NA,I want it to be true. The Prime Minister backed the general work of the Minister for,213
NA,Immigration but he did not back those particular words. While ministers for immigration have,213
NA,at different times dealt with challenges in immigration policies and settlement policies for,213
NA,"different communities in Australia, you have to go all the way back to the days of the White",213
NA,Australia policy to find a minister for immigration referring to communities that should be,213
NA,excluded based on race or religion. You have to go that far back.,213
NA,We should not underestimate the choices that are being made by this parliament right now.,213
NA,While we might be concerned at the extent to which some racist voices have been handed a,213
NA,"big megaphone, there is no megaphone louder in this country than the voice of the parliament",213
NA,itself-and it is at its loudest when we stand together. You cannot equivocate on this stuff:,213
NA,you either support and believe in modern multicultural Australia or you do not-and I have,213
NA,no doubt that the vast majority in this House and the other place do. I implore the Minister for,213
NA,Immigration not to go down the path he has started to step down. There is a way through for,213
NA,NA,213
NA,"him to simply talk about settlement policies, about integration policies, about bringing people",214
NA,into the centre and not link it back to whether a mistake was made by letting people in the,214
NA,door at all based on their race or religion. There is a way forward and I want him to take it.,214
NA,"We will define what sort of country we are, and no country has ever grown to prosperity by",214
NA,excluding a minority.,214
NA,Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (11:42): I want to start by reiterating some of the,214
NA,sentiments of the previous speaker. We want this motion to be unanimous and we want people,214
NA,in this parliament to support the spirit and ideals of the motion. One of the best ways to get,214
NA,there is not to use it as an opportunity for partisan political discussions designed to divide,214
NA,"society but to focus on how we are all coming together as a country. Hopefully, every",214
NA,member of the House of Representatives appeals to the idea that we are all equal before the,214
NA,law and everybody has a place in this country regardless of their background. This is not an,214
NA,opportunity for members to score cheap political points because they think it will get them,214
NA,some attention in a newspaper or enable them to go off and send messages to one section of,214
NA,"the community or another, as part of their grandstanding exercise, rather than focus on things",214
NA,that improve the human condition. And that is where I was disappointed with the previous,214
NA,"speaker and the way he conducted himself. In the end, he was not focusing on what we could",214
NA,do to bring the parliament together and support this motion unanimously. He used it as an,214
NA,opportunity to grandstand so that he himself could score cheap political points. And that is,214
NA,exactly what this motion is designed to stop.,214
NA,This motion is designed to focus on how we bring the country together and move it,214
NA,"forward together. When you look through the principles that underpin it, it is extremely",214
NA,"straightforward. It is based on a motion that was passed 20 years ago, through the leadership",214
NA,of John Howard. It is a motion to reaffirm our commitment to 'the right of all Australians to,214
NA,enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of their background'. We all,214
NA,agree. It is a motion to reaffirm our commitment to 'maintaining an immigration policy that is,214
NA,"wholly non-discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin'. Let's face it, it should",214
NA,also include any other irrelevant attributes. It also says:,214
NA,(3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,214
NA,"people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage;",214
NA,"(4) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society,",214
NA,"united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values; and",214
NA,(5) denounces racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to,214
NA,be.,214
NA,"At every point, all I have heard from people on the government side-all the ministers, all the",214
NA,members of parliament-has been a commitment to that process and a commitment to those,214
NA,ideals and values. When we use it as an opportunity to divide because we think we score,214
NA,"cheap political points it is not just that we distract from the central thrust of it, it is that we",214
NA,"undermine and send a message, somehow, to the rest of the community that these values are",214
NA,not shared and extolled. That is why this government takes values and principles so,214
NA,"strongly-as do I. In fact, these values in many ways are some of the key reasons that I sought",214
NA,to enter public life in the first place. Because there is no place in society for people to face,214
NA,marginalisation or exclusion simply because of who they are and the basis of how they live,214
NA,their lives.,214
NA,NA,214
NA,What we want is a society where everybody feels an equal investment and an opportunity,215
NA,"to contribute, both economically and socially, to build this country from the bottom up, where",215
NA,"we have individuals who come together to form families, community and ultimately country.",215
NA,That is the type of country we want to be. That is how we achieve a more just society. It is,215
NA,about how we take everybody forward together.,215
NA,"We know full well that we still have enormous challenges, particularly with Aboriginal and",215
NA,"Torres Strait Islander people, in making sure that they can move forward together as part of",215
NA,Australian society around issues of health and economic disadvantage. That is why as Human,215
NA,Rights Commissioner I was very proud to work on issues directly around improving the,215
NA,economic opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and enabling them to,215
NA,"use their land and property rights to achieve greater economic participation, not just as an end",215
NA,in itself but so that we could go on and build opportunities for a greater social dividend for,215
NA,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, particularly those outside capital cities. I was",215
NA,"very happy to enjoy the support of the Attorney-General, George Brandis, and the",215
NA,"government in doing that work, because there was so much advantage to it. I might add that I",215
NA,had the support also of many senior Indigenous leaders.,215
NA,That is how you take a country forward together. It is not done by focusing on points of,215
NA,negativity and division to try to achieve some political exercise. You take a country forward,215
NA,"together by focusing on the points that unite us as a country and, as the motion says at the",215
NA,"end, appeals to our idea of the kind of society and country that we want to be. That is why this",215
NA,government has had such a generous and ongoing commitment to a non-discriminatory global,215
NA,"humanitarian program. That commitment, despite the hyperbole and the vented and confected",215
NA,"outrage that, let's face it, has come from some of the other speakers, remains utterly resolute",215
NA,from the minister as well as from the government.,215
NA,Last financial year the government delivered a total refugee and humanitarian program of,215
NA,"17,555 places, which included 15,502 offshore places. That is the largest offshore intake in",215
NA,"Australia in 30 years, and was done under this current minister. Australia's annual refugee and",215
NA,"humanitarian program is set to grow to 18,750 by 2018-19. That is one of the most generous",215
NA,permanent resettlement programs in the world. We achieve that because we have a strong,215
NA,"border protection, we have a commitment from the government to make sure that people",215
NA,"smugglers are not rewarded and we have now, to the government's great credit, efforts to",215
NA,resettle in the United States as well as potentially other countries people who were held in,215
NA,offshore detention.,215
NA,"You cannot build public confidence and public support for higher rates of migration,",215
NA,"generally, as well as for helping people who are seeking asylum from across the world unless",215
NA,"the public believes that the borders are secure, that there is a process by which people are",215
NA,treated equally and with dignity and that people's assessment of their claims is based on the,215
NA,"legitimacy of their claims, not on their process of arrival. That is what this government has",215
NA,achieved and is one of its great achievements and legacies that it will continue to contribute to,215
NA,the development of this great country. By maintaining public confidence in this issue of,215
NA,"border security, which is so vital, the government has continued to be able to offer 16,350",215
NA,visas since July 2015 to those displaced by the conflict in Syria and Iraq-helping people,215
NA,"based on legitimacy of their need, not on the process of their arrival. We have also had been",215
NA,"able to offer 5,490 people who have been interviewed and assessed as meeting the threshold",215
NA,NA,215
NA,"requirements for a visa and are awaiting the outcomes of health, character and security",216
NA,checks. These new Australians-new Australians-will be provided with the best opportunity,216
NA,to start productive lives and reach their full potential. That is what we want-that is,216
NA,something that is good for our country. Those are the values and the spirit the motion the,216
NA,"Prime Minister has moved and which we are debating and discussing, and hopefully",216
NA,"supporting, very much seeks to achieve.",216
NA,The government is proudly sustaining our world-class resettlement services. Entrants are,216
NA,"eligible for the same social service benefits as other humanitarian entrants, including",216
NA,"Medicare, income support payments, English language tuition, torture and trauma counselling",216
NA,and settlement services. The objective of that is to take people and to enable them to best,216
NA,"integrate into Australian society, and then go on and live productive lives. That again goes to",216
NA,"the heart and the spirit of the program of the government, but equally what it seeks to achieve",216
NA,when we bring people here is that they can be full participants as new Australians. We are,216
NA,"committed to enabling these new Australians to become self-reliant, to stand on their own two",216
NA,"feet, not just so they can take care of themselves, though that is very important, but so they",216
NA,can assist those who come in similar waves of migration to contribute to this great country,216
NA,and participate equally in all of Australian society.,216
NA,That is at the heart of what liberalism is-it is a political philosophy built on the idea and,216
NA,"the capacity of the individual to make their maximum contribution, to live their lives and be",216
NA,able to make their commitment and contribution to our society. That is why the spirit of this,216
NA,"motion goes to the heart of liberalism itself-not labourism, which in the past, sadly, has been",216
NA,at times deliberately exclusionary-which focuses on those uniting principles that bind all,216
NA,"people, that sit in the heart of Liberal philosophy and that motivate us, including yourself, Mr",216
NA,"Deputy Speaker, to leave our community and come onto the national stage and be able to",216
NA,reaffirm those basic commitments of liberty for all. That is why I support this motion. I hope,216
NA,"other members of this House do. In fact, I agree with the aspirations of the previous speaker,",216
NA,"the member for Watson, and my hope is that support for this motion is achieved unanimously.",216
NA,"In the end it does send a message about the type of country we want to be-united, focused",216
NA,"on the future and building the potential of every single Australian, new or old, to contribute to",216
NA,this great country. (Time expired),216
Mr GEORGANAS ,Hindmarsh) (11:52): I rise to speak on this motion on equality for all,216
NA,"Australians. I believe Australians see themselves, rightly, as an egalitarian society and it is",216
NA,vital that we affirm and continue to reaffirm our commitment to equal rights for all in this,216
NA,nation. But in this debate it is equally vital that we ask ourselves what is it exactly that creates,216
NA,"and most importantly maintains and protects equal rights. While legislation is important,",216
NA,"unless a society is able to adapt and be flexible in the face of changing circumstances, equal",216
NA,"rights can become questionable, questioned and challenged. There is no doubt that Australia",216
NA,has made a very successful commitment to human rights. I think we have been one of the,216
NA,most successful countries in the entire world. I cannot think of another nation that has done,216
NA,"better in this area than us. But it is imperative that we continue to remind ourselves, and",216
NA,"others, of the need for and positive benefits of equal rights. Changes in legislation are",216
NA,important-no-one can deny that-but legislation alone does not ensure equal rights. As we,216
NA,"have seen through the debate on section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, legislation can",216
NA,NA,216
NA,"be changed, undermining equal rights at the drop of a hat. Unless the wider community is",217
NA,"convinced of the importance of defending equal rights, these rights will remain vulnerable.",217
NA,It is our job as policy and law makers to ensure that we make a strong case for the,217
NA,protection of equal rights. My electorate of Hindmarsh is a very diverse community. As I,217
NA,"have said many times in this place, approximately 200 languages are spoken in my electorate.",217
NA,"People have settled there from every corner of the world, from the traditional postwar",217
NA,"migrants to the new emerging communities. Every language that you can possibly think of,",217
NA,every nation you can possibly think of is represented within my electorate.,217
NA,"In 2016, the ABS estimated almost 27 per cent of Hindmarsh residents were born overseas.",217
NA,"Since postwar migration began, Australia has been taking in approximately one million",217
NA,"immigrants each decade from every region of the world, and today 15 per cent of the",217
NA,population report that they speak a language other than English at home. I am so proud of the,217
NA,"cultural diversity within our nation, and within my electorate of course, because, as I said, I",217
NA,do not think there is any nation in the world that has done it better than us.,217
NA,"I have always been a fighter to protect this great cultural diversity, and our",217
NA,"multiculturalism, and I will continue to do so, as I know many others in this place will do so,",217
NA,because I believe that our successful multicultural society is truly one of the greatest assets,217
NA,that we have in this nation. Multiculturalism has been an important element in the making of,217
NA,"modern Australia, and has been critical to fostering social cohesion and inclusion. It has",217
NA,"underpinned cohesion and inclusion, and, through multiculturalism, the Australian experience",217
NA,has shown that diversity can absolutely go hand in hand with stronger social cohesion. This is,217
NA,undoubtedly thanks to successive governments on both sides who have supported,217
NA,"multiculturalism and, of course, the broader labour movement.",217
NA,"Official racial discrimination, in the form of the Immigration Restriction Act 1901-more",217
NA,commonly known as the White Australia policy-was not removed until the 1970s when the,217
NA,policies around multiculturalism emerged. It was the Whitlam Labor government that set,217
NA,"about addressing many of these inequalities, followed by the Fraser and Hawke governments.",217
NA,"I remember as a teenager, back in the seventies, attending one of my community's annual",217
NA,"functions, the Greek Orthodox ball. This particular night we had some very honoured",217
NA,guests-I will never forget it-and the whole community with just astounded by the,217
NA,attendance of Gough Whitlam and Don Dunstan. It was the first time we had ever seen people,217
NA,of that calibre attend one of our functions. I remember how excited everyone was-and that,217
NA,"memory is still vivid in my mind, which could have been something that threw me into",217
NA,"politics. To have this great man there, the Prime Minister of Australia, giving a speech and",217
NA,"telling us how he valued our community, how he saw the contribution that our community",217
NA,"had made, was something that we had never witnessed before. From that moment onwards, I",217
NA,recall feeling equal to everyone else. Any inadequacies that I had about being from a different,217
NA,"background or perhaps my parents speaking a different language, being different, was thrown",217
NA,out the window that night because we felt equal. I remember it very well. We still talk about,217
NA,that night in my community in South Australia.,217
NA,Let us not forget that immigration to Australia was closely tied to labour market needs. My,217
NA,"parents came here after World War II, from a nation that had been absolutely decimated by",217
NA,"war. They came here with very little English. They worked in the lowest paid jobs, but they",217
NA,managed to carve out a life for themselves. They did that because of the labour laws that,217
NA,NA,217
NA,"existed in this country. There was a debate after World War II, when we decided to open up",218
NA,"immigration-if you look at the Hansards, you will see the debates-where, on the one hand,",218
NA,"there was a group within this place, and outside in industry, that agreed with bringing in",218
NA,"migrant workers, but wanted to have them on lower pay rates than Australian workers. On the",218
NA,"other hand, there was the view of the labour movement that staunchly said, no, they would be",218
NA,on the same pay rates as everyone else if they come out here. And you can imagine how life,218
NA,"would have been so different had that not prevailed back then. So in addressing equality, we",218
NA,need to also address inequality in the workplace. We see today many people coming out on,218
NA,"different types of visas. I say this: if we have a shortage in particular areas, bring them out as",218
NA,"migrants to settle in this nation, to be part of our community, to fill the gaps that are required",218
NA,and to become Australians. Like all of us have. That is really important.,218
NA,"In addressing equality, the workplace is fundamental. In 1973, the then Labor government",218
NA,ratified ILO convention 111. This required a commitment to remove discrimination in,218
NA,"employment on the basis of race, colour, gender, political opinion, national extraction or",218
NA,"social origin. Importantly, however, it also involved taking positive action to promote real",218
NA,"equality of opportunity in employment. In 1973, the government's position was fully",218
NA,"supported by business, the ACTU and the state governments. As a result of this commitment,",218
NA,"the first federal antidiscrimination law, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, was enacted,",218
NA,"making it unlawful to take certain actions by reason of race, colour, religion or national or",218
NA,ethnic origin of a person or a relative or associate of that person.,218
NA,"However, before the bill was introduced into parliament, the conservative then Liberal-",218
NA,National Party coalition government came to power in 1975. It took another nine years and a,218
NA,"Labor Party victory before this legislation was finally passed. During this period, those states",218
NA,which had Labor Party governments put in place their own antidiscrimination legislation.,218
NA,"They took matters into their own hands, enabling citizens to make formal complaints in the",218
NA,"face of discrimination based on gender, race, ethnic origin, religion and physical disability.",218
NA,"So, while Australia today can be very proud of its equality, it clearly has not always been",218
NA,"the case. We only need to recall our treatment of Indigenous Australians, the White Australia",218
NA,"policy, the Cronulla riot and our growing mistrust of certain nationalities. Today sometimes I",218
NA,"despair when I hear language that is being used in reference to diversity, inclusion and",218
NA,"multiculturalism. More and more I hear words of fear, of exclusion, calls for the building of",218
NA,"walls and fortresses, calls for the banning of certain clothing, calls for the banning of certain",218
NA,foods and even calls for the banning of certain groups from entering the country. These voices,218
NA,"are very, very few, but they are very loud. We must remember that: they are very few but",218
NA,unfortunately very loud.,218
NA,There is no doubt that the recent demonisation of refugees has contributed to the language,218
NA,"of fear, and it is contaminating the way we view our cultural diversity. But I am certain that in",218
NA,"this place, if we take a moment to see this within a global context, we know that there are",218
NA,"over 60 million refugees seeking refuge. I support united, equal rights for all, not just for",218
NA,some but for everyone. (Time expired),218
Dr ALY ,Cowan) (12:02): I rise here today to talk about equality for all Australians. I,218
NA,have spent a long part of my life talking about equality and working towards equality. I have,218
NA,"devoted many years to that. So I stand here today torn, I guess, in speaking about this issue.",218
NA,"On the one hand, I think: it is the year 2016. Shouldn't we, as a progressive, First World",218
NA,NA,218
NA,"nation, take it for granted that all Australians have equal rights and that the equal rights for all",219
NA,Australians are embedded in everything that we do? Don't all Australians already enjoy equal,219
NA,rights? Why do we even need to be talking about this in this day and age?,219
NA,"But, on the other hand, I know through my own experiences that, though we have formal",219
NA,"equal rights for most things-bar of course marriage equality-and for most people, those",219
NA,formal rights that are by law accorded to all Australians do not necessarily translate into,219
NA,"substantive equality and into substantive rights, into an equality where all Australians are not",219
NA,just accorded equal rights but have equal access to opportunities and equal outcomes. That,219
NA,kind of equality recognises that not all of us start life on an equal playing field. The provision,219
NA,of equal rights for all means that no single person's rights or the rights for some group are,219
NA,over and above anyone else's rights or the rights of another group.,219
NA,This morning I spoke to the media about an experience I had while growing up. When I,219
NA,"was 10 years old, I was pursued by a young girl of the same age, 10 years old, in the",219
NA,schoolyard. For some reason she disliked me from the very first day I started at this new,219
NA,"school. As a 10-year-old, I never quite understood why she disliked me. I had never done",219
NA,"anything to her. We had never had any real altercations in the schoolyard, but Christine-that",219
NA,was her name-and her friend Iris would seek me out every single lunchtime and every single,219
NA,recess time. They would follow me around the playground and taunt me. One lunch time it,219
NA,"culminated in Christine spitting in my face, telling me that I was a dirty Muslim, a dirty Arab,",219
NA,"and that she hated me because I did not believe in Jesus. Of course, Muslims do believe in",219
NA,"Jesus, but that was beside the point. I then went to my teacher Mrs Phillips. I was very",219
NA,distraught when I reported to her what Christine had just done. Rather than her offer any kind,219
NA,"of comfort, rather than pull up Christine and Iris for the comments they had made, it was a",219
NA,case of: we are not considered equal.,219
NA,I note that there are some people in this parliament and in this government who would seek,219
NA,to argue that they have a right to free speech. I would ask those people whether they think that,219
NA,"their right to free speech is better than or worth more than my right to feel protected, whether",219
NA,"they think that their right to be a bigot is worth more than my right to have a form of recourse,",219
NA,"to have some form of justice, to be able to call out the things, the activities, the behaviours",219
NA,that are taken against me not because of anything I have said or not because of anything I,219
NA,have done but simply because of the colour of my skin.,219
NA,We cannot claim to have an Australia where all Australians are equal if we do not pursue,219
NA,all rights equally. We cannot claim to have an Australia where every Australian has equal,219
NA,rights if we pursue the rights of one group over and above the rights of another group. All,219
NA,rights are worth pursuing and all rights are worth pursuing equally. So I ask: is my life and,219
NA,my rights the lesser? Am I second-class citizen where my right to feel protected is less than,219
NA,somebody's right to be a bigot? These are questions that I think we should not have to ask in,219
NA,"the year 2016; but, sadly, we do have to ask them.",219
NA,"This morning I received death threats. I do not worry about myself because, in this place, I",219
NA,am afforded the protections that not many people are afforded. But these were death threats,219
NA,against my family. Somebody came out and said that they would like to kill my family.,219
NA,Where are my rights?,219
NA,Can we honestly say that all Australians have equal rights when we are sitting in this,219
NA,parliament debating about whether or not we should take away an essential law that has,219
NA,NA,219
NA,"served Australia well for 20 years, a part of the Racial Discrimination Act that has served",220
NA,Australia well for 20 years and that has protected people like me for 20 years? Can we,220
NA,honestly say that we have achieved equal rights for all Australians?,220
NA,Just to finish: we cannot talk about equal rights for all Australians without also talking,220
NA,"about the substantive and very real fact that inequality exists for many Australians in many,",220
NA,"many different ways, not just in the ways that I have just mentioned through my personal",220
NA,"story but for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, for our LGBTIQ",220
NA,communities and for the communities of the outer suburbs for whom inequality exists in the,220
NA,"lack of access to infrastructure, services and job opportunities. In my electorate of Cowan, a",220
NA,child growing up in Wanneroo is 30 per cent less likely to finish school. A family living in,220
NA,Lockridge has half the income of those in the inner suburbs.,220
NA,"Until we recognise the inequality that exists for people in Australia in all its forms, not just",220
NA,"in the forms that affect people like me-because, let us face it, I am also privileged to be in",220
NA,the position that I am in and feel honoured to be in the position that I am in. Inequality also,220
NA,exists for people who are not racially different or who are not religious minorities. It exists in,220
NA,different ways for different people in Australia. Until we recognise the real and substantive,220
NA,"impact of those inequalities across Australia, diversely across all forms and all backgrounds",220
NA,"for all Australians, we can never stop talking about this. We need to continue talking about",220
NA,"this, and, more than that, we need to continue taking action to ensure that those inequalities do",220
NA,"not continue to affect standards of living, quality of life and mental health for people across",220
NA,"Australia. For we will never be truly free, and we will never be a truly progressive country,",220
NA,until we are all well and truly equal.,220
Ms BUTLER ,Griffith) (12:12): I too rise to speak in relation to this motion moved by the,220
NA,"Prime Minister and supported by Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, in what was",220
NA,intended to be a moment of national unity reflecting the same type of moment of national,220
NA,unity that occurred 20 years ago in 1996 when then Prime Minister John Howard and Kim,220
NA,"Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, moved a motion in the same terms. Since",220
NA,"this motion was moved, it has become, if anything, more important for national leadership on",220
NA,issues of unity than ever before in the history of this nation. We are in a situation today where,220
NA,"decades of commitment to multiculturalism, immigration and reconciliation are at risk of",220
NA,being eroded-where that progress is at risk of being eroded-and that is a terrible thing for,220
NA,our nation. Not only is it a terrible thing because of the sharp end of bigotry and racism but it,220
NA,"is a terrible thing because multiculturalism, immigration and movements towards",220
NA,reconciliation have done so much for this country over such a long period of time.,220
NA,It is estimated that 10 million people have arrived and settled in Australia since the First,220
NA,"Fleet came here. Seven million of them have come to Australia since 1945, so there has been",220
NA,a massive amount of postwar migration to Australia. That massive amount of postwar,220
NA,"migration means that, today, one in four Australians was born overseas and almost half of",220
NA,Australians-46 per cent-have at least one parent who was born overseas. That is,220
NA,contributing to making us the incredibly successful multicultural country that we have been,220
NA,for a very long time. It is estimated that migrants provide an estimated fiscal benefit of over,220
NA,"$10 billion in their first 10 years of settlement here in Australia, so it is not just a cultural",220
NA,"contribution, which is in and of itself very important, but an economic one.",220
NA,NA,220
NA,The economic impacts are worth mentioning because they are so significant. Migration,221
NA,Council Australia estimated that by 2050 migration would be contributing $1.6 trillion to,221
NA,"Australia's GDP. It will have added 15.7 per cent to Australia's workforce participation rate,",221
NA,21.9 per cent to after-tax real wages for low-skilled workers and 5.9 per cent in GDP per,221
NA,capita growth. They have estimated that by 2050 each individual migrant would be,221
NA,"contributing, on average, 10 per cent more to Australia's economy than existing residents.",221
NA,That is not the only set of reporting or modelling in relation to the economic contributions,221
NA,"of migrants. Professor Graeme Hugo's report Economic, social and civic contributions of first",221
NA,"and second generation humanitarian entrants, which was a study commissioned by the",221
NA,"Department of Immigration and Citizenship, found that refugees and other humanitarian",221
NA,entrants provided significant economic benefit to our country. The report's analysis of data by,221
NA,country of birth found that for second-generation humanitarian arrivals-people whose,221
NA,parents came here as refugees-at least half of the nationality groups had a higher level of,221
NA,"participation than the Australian-born population and that, because humanitarian entrants are",221
NA,"highly entrepreneurial, with a higher than average proportion of those entrants engaging in",221
NA,"small and medium business enterprises, that makes a contribution to our economy. Also there",221
NA,is the willingness of people who have come from very difficult situations to fill some low-,221
NA,wage and low-skilled jobs.,221
NA,"All of these things are an economic contribution to our nation, and we should remember",221
NA,"them, but more importantly when we talk about national unity we should remember the sort of",221
NA,country that we want to be. We should remember the sort of country that we dream of being.,221
NA,"Racism, the coarsening of public debate, public attacks and vilification do not just hurt the",221
NA,people who are vilified; they hurt everyone. They hurt our entire society. No-one gets to live,221
NA,on an island in Australia-in a metaphorical sense; obviously there are people living on,221
NA,islands! No person gets to live isolated from our society. That is not the way it works. No,221
NA,"matter how wealthy you are, no matter how poor you are, no matter what you do or where you",221
NA,"have come from, the nature of Australian society affects your life.",221
NA,That is why we should be very concerned about some of the division that is starting to,221
NA,arise. In my own electorate it took the form of a party that was aimed at stopping Muslim,221
NA,immigration into Australia and that ran against me at the last federal election. It is also a,221
NA,situation where you see vilification and abuse online. The sorts of things that nobody would,221
NA,even have thought of saying on the street 20 years ago are now routinely written online.,221
NA,I was particularly thinking about this today. I was recently in the media talking about a,221
NA,racial vilification case where some students had been alleged to have written some Facebook,221
NA,"posts after not being able to use an Indigenous-specific computer lab, using words like,",221
NA,"'Where's the white supremacist lab?' and, 'Why are we meeting segregation with segregation?'",221
NA,"There was a Facebook post-and the person whose name was on it said it was a hacking, of",221
NA,course-using the phrase 'ITT' and then the n-word. There were a number of matters alleged,221
NA,in this case.,221
NA,"The case itself was not successful, because the judge found that there was no reasonable",221
NA,prospect of success and struck it out around eight months after the applicants had made a,221
NA,"strike-out application. That, to me, goes to show something really important, which is that the",221
NA,"vilification laws are quite narrow in this country, and rightly so. You want to have vilification",221
NA,NA,221
NA,laws that meet their aims of both signalling the inappropriateness and wrongness of,222
NA,vilification and providing a remedy when the worst cases of vilification arise.,222
NA,"I spoke about that case on television recently, and today I received an email from someone",222
NA,"I have known for a long time but not very well, and that is Susan Moriarty. She wrote to me:",222
NA,I am the lawyer acting for Cindy Prior-,222
NA,who was the applicant in that case. She said:,222
NA,"Up until Friday 18 November, there were over 9,000 comments-",222
NA,online-,222
NA,about Cindy's case. It has been like being forced to watch a public flogging. 'Just kill her - problem,222
NA,"solved' wrote one North American on The Australian Facebook page, while another wrote 'wrap that",222
NA,"bitch in plastic and sink her in the sea'. Another wrote 'let's get crowd funding going, so we can",222
NA,bankrupt this black bitch' while another wrote 'she can't have been vilified because if she had she'd been,222
NA,lynched by now'. Another wrote 'this black-,222
NA,'c-word'-,222
NA,has set back the constitutional amendment - remember that Prior'. Another screamed for her ovaries to,222
NA,be torn from her body and burned so that she could never breed.,222
NA,Ms Moriarty wrote:,222
NA,On and on and on and on went these murderous inclinations by white Australia. She arrived home to,222
NA,read this on her Facebook –,222
NA,I just want you to know that you're a racist bigot and should be held accountable for your racist,222
NA,bigotry. Instead of you flashing a victim card while discriminating against individuals on the basis of,222
NA,"their race, why don't you take a step back and realise what a hypocrite and unbelievably racist piece of",222
NA,shit you are-,222
NA,'c-word. F-word you.'-,222
NA,You need special treatment because you cannot take responsibility for yourself as an individual. Anyone,222
NA,giving you special treatment is just practicing soft bigotry of low expectations. They expect you to be a,222
NA,"leech, you-",222
NA,'f-ing c-word.' Ms Moriarty went on to say:,222
NA,"Six month ago, the 'White Lives Matter' movement ... leafleted her-",222
NA,the applicant's-,222
NA,suburb in Western Australia. Because she-,222
NA,the applicant-,222
NA,was unambiguously an indigenous Australian she had remained hidden indoors for several days.,222
NA,What is also interesting is the reaction of some people who went onto a Facebook page that,222
NA,had been created by a former QUT student after that case had been struck out. It was struck,222
NA,"out in early November. It makes for pretty awful reading, to be honest. Students or apparent",222
NA,students-maybe they had all been hacked-wrote: 'ITT: n-word' the same quote that had,222
NA,"been alleged in this matter. There was a chap-it appears to be a chap, but it is Facebook and",222
NA,maybe they had all been hacked-who said:,222
NA,All the aboriginals accomplished in forty thousand years in Australia is just some shit finger paintings.,222
NA,Another person said:,222
NA,"Apparently they're the only ""civilisation"" to never independently invent the wheel",222
NA,NA,222
NA,"Another person said: 'ITT n-word', again, the same quote that was alleged in the case. Another",223
NA,person said:,223
NA,Where's the white supremacist computer lab so I can continue this thread properly,223
NA,Another person said:,223
NA,I wonder if you can say ITT-,223
NA,'n-word'-,223
NA,on ss2.0 again?,223
NA,The respondent who was alleged to have said it appears to have said-it may not be him;,223
NA,maybe it was hacked:,223
NA,Give it a crack what's the worst that can happen?,223
NA,These things are very concerning. It is a coarsening of our public debate and we should be,223
NA,very worried about it.,223
NA,NA,223
NA,instigated by the opposition leader and moved by the Prime Minister. It is a very important,223
NA,motion that we speak on today: the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated,223
NA,"with equal respect, regardless of race, colour, creed or origin. It is a very important motion",223
NA,"and I am proud to speak here today in the people's place, in Parliament House, where we",223
NA,reaffirm our commitment to ensure that all Australians can enjoy the rights and respectful,223
NA,"treatment that is often taken for granted by some of us. This is an important matter,",223
NA,irrespective of whether you are an Indigenous Australian or your ancestors migrated here as,223
NA,"convicts or free settlers or arrived here recently from Holland or wherever, or even if you",223
NA,"came here seeking asylum, or any other permutation of those. We are not first-, secondor",223
NA,third-generation migrants; we are all Australians who have some of those other,223
NA,characteristics. It saddens me greatly when I hear that members of the multicultural,223
NA,"community, especially in my electorate of Moreton, have been treated disrespectfully. My",223
NA,"dear departed mum taught me that good manners are always important, and I know that my",223
NA,"mum never got anything wrong, so I think she was on the money. Sadly, it still happens that",223
NA,"people are treated disrespectfully, as we have heard from speakers in the bipartisan support",223
NA,for this motion.,223
NA,"In fact, just last week, members of the Taiwanese, Rwandan, Indian, Fijian, Egyptian,",223
NA,"Filipino, Bosnian, Pakistani and South African communities joined me in my electorate office",223
NA,to hear the member for Cowan talk about her experience of growing up in a multicultural,223
NA,"community. It was a fascinating discussion but, sadly, many of those present at that table",223
NA,shared their own stories of being the victims of racial discrimination. The shared their very,223
NA,real concerns about the possibility of racial discrimination laws being watered down. I am,223
NA,fortunate that my community on Brisbane's south side is pretty much a model of inclusive,223
NA,cultural diversity. I am not being naive; I know that there are still some racists in the,223
NA,"community who sometimes get frustrated and articulate things that are horrible, and every",223
NA,"now and then there are some manifestations of racism. But, on the whole, our community-",223
NA,"like much of modern-day Queensland, I would suggest-celebrates our diversity and the",223
NA,contributions that members of communities have made to Australia irrespective of where they,223
NA,have come from.,223
NA,NA,223
NA,I would just like to mention a few of these considerable contributions. The Sunnybank,224
NA,"RSL, with the support of the local Chinese community, created a memorial for all those",224
NA,"Chinese Australians, or people of Chinese heritage, who have served Australia in past wars.",224
NA,"The memorial recognises soldiers like Billy Sing and Caleb Shang, who fought in the First",224
NA,"World War, and Jack Wong Sue, who served Australia in World War II, to name but a few.",224
NA,"There are many other great stories of courage and bravery by the Chinese Australian diaspora,",224
NA,"and they have been commemorated by this memorial. Just one of the stories, a well-known",224
NA,"story, is that of Private Billy Sing, who was a sniper with the Australian 5th Light Horse",224
NA,Regiment. He was a kangaroo shooter originally but went over to Gallipoli and was,224
NA,conservatively credited with more than 150 kills in Gallipoli. He was known to his fellow,224
NA,soldiers as 'the assassin' and was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for conspicuous,224
NA,gallantry as a sniper at ANZAC.,224
NA,The memorial itself was a labour of love for the Chinese community and it has contributed,224
NA,to stronger links between that community and the local RSL. It is a continuing reminder of the,224
NA,"diversity, cooperation, understanding and friendship that exists on Brisbane's south side, and",224
NA,"it also goes a long way to recognising the slights and racism that existed, perhaps, 100 years",224
NA,ago when people were allowed to fight and die for their country but were not allowed to own,224
NA,land because they were seen to be not Australian because they were Chinese-and there are,224
NA,others.,224
NA,I also point out that the success of the Chinese war memorial has inspired a,224
NA,commemoration of contributions from other communities. There is currently a project,224
NA,"underway, which I am excited to be a part of, to erect a memorial for the Indian Australian",224
NA,service men and women who contributed to Australian war efforts in the past and are doing so,224
NA,"now. I was pleased to attend a dinner just a few weeks ago, where the winning design for this",224
NA,"memorial was announced. We had a mock-up of the winning design, and 11 students from",224
NA,"Griffith University turned up at the dinner. I think it is going to be a great project, so I look",224
NA,forward to working with the Indian Australian community and to seeing that completed,224
NA,"memorial in due course. Like the Chinese memorial, there will also be bursaries associated",224
NA,"with the memorial, so you will have the physical memorial but then you will have the living",224
NA,bursary where students from local high schools will be urged to research and tell those stories.,224
NA,I would also like to mention the contribution of another Australian. I was very pleased to,224
NA,attend an event on the weekend where the member for Fisher was representing the Prime,224
NA,"Minister. It was for the Australian African community and, at the event on Saturday night, an",224
NA,award was given for an act of incredible bravery by a former refugee from Sudan. Aguek,224
NA,Nyok came to Australia as a refugee from Sudan and now drives a taxi in Brisbane. He took a,224
NA,break from collecting his passengers to get a haircut at the local Moorooka shops one day last,224
NA,"month, and as he left the hairdresser's shop he saw smoke billowing out of a bus on",224
NA,Beaudesert Road-at a bus stop that I walk through every morning when I am in Brisbane.,224
NA,"Aguek saw passengers trapped inside and bashed open the back door and, by his bravery,",224
NA,"saved 11 people who were trapped inside the bus, which was filling up with toxic fumes. This",224
NA,"was an incredible act of bravery. Many people would not run towards flames, especially in a",224
NA,bus that might explode. But this brave Australian says:,224
NA,I just helped people and that is what I am expecting from my fellow Australians if I was in the same,224
NA,situation.,224
NA,NA,224
NA,"We can all learn from his bravery and, dare I say it, his humility. Aguek Nyok was the very",225
NA,worthy recipient of the African Australians Bravery and Heroes Award at the celebration of,225
NA,African Australians national awards held at the Brisbane City Hall on Saturday night.,225
NA,"As I said, I am very lucky to be constantly reminded in my community of the valuable",225
NA,contributions that can be made by all Australians in a diverse and inclusive community. This,225
NA,motion reaffirms our commitment to maintaining that successful inclusive community. The,225
NA,success of our multicultural communities is in large part dependent on continuing to denounce,225
NA,racial intolerance. The recently announced inquiry into freedom of speech will look at how,225
NA,our laws that prevent racial hate speech are working. It is important to remember that freedom,225
NA,"of speech has no explicit constitutional protection. Commonwealth, state and territory",225
NA,legislative protections are not absolute. They contain necessary limits to accommodate the,225
NA,countervailing public interest. There can be a natural tension between one person's right to be,225
NA,free from racial discrimination and another person's perception that they have a right to speak,225
NA,freely. The total freedom of one will negate the rights of the other. It is necessary for good,225
NA,governments to balance these important rights.,225
NA,Prime Minister Gough Whitlam introduced the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. From,225
NA,"memory, I do not think it was broadly supported by the Liberal Party, apart from Neville",225
NA,"Bonner, the senator from Queensland; nevertheless, the Fraser government did not do",225
NA,anything to abolish the Racial Discrimination Act when it was in power. This important,225
NA,"legislation has been protecting individuals against discrimination for 41 years. Then, just over",225
NA,"20 years ago, the protections in section 18C and exemptions contained in section 18D were",225
NA,added. Then Attorney-General Michael Lavarch said in his second reading speech to,225
NA,introduce the bill:,225
NA,This bill is an appropriate and measured response to closing the identified gap in the legal protection of,225
NA,all Australians from extreme racist behaviour. It strikes a balance between the right of free speech and,225
NA,the other rights and interests of Australia and Australians.,225
NA,In the years since 18C was added the Human Rights Commission has received about 100,225
NA,"complaints a year, and most of these are resolved through a conciliation process. Only about",225
NA,five end up in court annually. Obviously the claims are limited. I am supportive of the idea,225
NA,"that we do not offend people because of their race, obviously. Religion is something to",225
NA,discuss as another topic. I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for this,225
NA,motion before the chamber.,225
NA,Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) (12:32): This motion has languished in the basement,225
NA,of parliamentary business for a couple of months-two months does not sound like a lot of,225
NA,"time to most Australians but if you look at what has gone on over the last two months, it has",225
NA,been a very long time indeed. Last night I read the Prime Minister's speech on this motion. It,225
NA,was a good speech-a very good speech. There was not a word in there that I could not agree,225
NA,"with. Sadly, it was very difficult, looking at the Prime Minister who gave that speech two",225
NA,"months ago, who spoke most eloquently and passionately in support of this motion, to",225
NA,recognise the Prime Minister who has done very little in the last couple of days to confront,225
NA,"the rising tide of bigotry, including bigotry in this place.",225
NA,The motion reconfirms our commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal,225
NA,"rights-a policy which is based wholly on non-discriminatory grounds when it comes to race,",225
NA,"colour, creed or country of origin. It reaffirms our commitment to the process of",225
NA,NA,225
NA,reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; it reaffirms our commitment,226
NA,"to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open society. How easy would it",226
NA,have been during question time yesterday for the Prime Minister to repeat those words that he,226
NA,spoke so passionately not two months ago? What has changed?,226
NA,Much has been written in the last two weeks about what has changed: Trumpism and the US,226
NA,election; back further we can look at Brexit-the vote by millions of Brits to excise,226
NA,themselves from the European Union; and closer to home we can look at the results of the,226
NA,2016 election and now the monumental swing against the National Party in the New South,226
NA,Wales by-election in Orange.,226
NA,"From Australia, Trumpism looks like a disaffection with the political class-technocrats,",226
NA,"the city elites and the experts. Those very same insiders, those experts, are now bemoaning",226
NA,"what appears to them to be post-facts politics. In fact, they do it with the exact same vigour",226
NA,the way that their detractors conclude that all of those facts and all those theories are just a,226
NA,"conspiracy from the insiders, those very people who are controlling and making the decisions",226
NA,that we do not agree with. There is more than a nagging suspicion amongst this group that the,226
NA,"trade deals have got more downside than upside, unless you are a merchant banker. It is a",226
NA,"belief that immigration policy is working against their interest in some sort of zero-sum, one-",226
NA,"more-mouth-to-feed way. In all this, words like 'innovation', 'modernity', 'economic change'",226
NA,and even 'multiculturalism' sound like doublespeak for a future that does not include these,226
NA,people.,226
NA,There is a lot we can recognise in our own country in all of this. It really is not that hard to,226
NA,"understand if you are listening and, of course, can be a stretch if it is a long way from your",226
NA,lived experience. If you are a city professional putting in 50 to 60 hours a week and pulling in,226
NA,"your six-zero-figured salary, it might be a bit hard to understand that upwards of a million",226
NA,Australians are in jobs where they are not getting enough hours to bring in the income which,226
NA,"is meeting their cost of living. If you are working these mad hours in the inner city, it might",226
NA,be very difficult for you to understand that there are people who are in a casual or a part-time,226
NA,job who do not have enough work to pay their bills.,226
NA,"If you stop listening, you are not going to hear what they are saying. If you are listening,",226
NA,you might hear the guy who is saying: 'I no longer have a permanent job' or 'I'm 29 years of,226
NA,"age and I've never had a permanent job' or 'For the last month, I've spent four hours travelling",226
NA,to and from work everyday for a job that I may not have in six months time and people ask,226
NA,me why I don't move from the place where I live to the place where I'm working. I tell you,226
NA,reason I don't move is because I can't afford to rent or buy a house there and I don't even,226
NA,know if I'm going to have that job in a few months time.' These are the people who are deeply,226
NA,concerned with what is going on in Australia and we hear their concerns. When you have a,226
NA,"decent conversation with these people, when you duck below the dog-whistling and all the",226
NA,"noise and the concern and you talk to them about their concerns, you talk to them about",226
NA,"'Islamophobia'-a word that they would never use-they might say, 'I really am concerned",226
NA,"about all that bombing and that killing that is going on in Iraq and Syria, and I don't want that",226
NA,stuff going on here.' Is that too hard to understand? It really is not too hard to understand.,226
NA,"America with its politics, its economy and its culture are very different places to Australia",226
NA,but there are plenty of similarities. We are both advanced economies with cities that are fully,226
NA,embedded in the modern and international economy and regions that are in industrial decline.,226
NA,NA,226
NA,"We have been trading nations that have enjoyed the benefits of trade with Asia and, in the",227
NA,"case of the United States with Latin America, have been able to spread the benefits of that",227
NA,"trade to jobs in labour-intensive sectors, particularly in resources and manufacturing. But now",227
NA,"with the growth in Asian manufacturing capacity, it means that the region that was once the",227
NA,market for our goods is now the origins of our import competition. If you live in one of these,227
NA,"big cities, the transition from the manufacturing economy to a service economy might have",227
NA,"been less marked. But if you live in a region like mine, it has been extreme, and I know in",227
NA,"your region, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, it has also been extreme. You see, the goods that",227
NA,"you were once able to afford, which were the trade-off for those well-paid jobs-those goods",227
NA,have disappeared.,227
NA,"At the heart of this discontent is economics, because the truth for Australia and for the",227
NA,world is that we have dropped the ball when it comes to equality. There is growing inequality,227
NA,"right across the board, but nowhere is it greater than between city and regional Australia. In",227
NA,"the Illawarra on the South Coast, unemployment rates are three to five times those in the",227
NA,capital cities. Income disparity is growing rapidly. There are unacceptably high suicide rates,227
NA,"all across the country, but these are multiplied by two and three and four in regional Australia.",227
NA,This is the circumstance which is breeding discontent; it is inequality which is breeding,227
NA,alienation and discontent. It is the way that we respond to this inequality which defines us. It,227
NA,is the way that we respond to the exclusion and the fear and uncertainty which defines us as a,227
NA,nation.,227
NA,It would be quite open to us to use parliament and the privilege of our titles to stoke the fire,227
NA,of discontent. We could do that. We know that there are ready ears out there for that,227
NA,"message-people who are already hurting, because they are not getting the benefits that the",227
NA,Prime Minister talks about of these never-more-exciting times where we are 'nimble'. That is,227
NA,another world to the world that these people live in. We could convince people that the real,227
NA,"cause-of unemployment, of homelessness, of rental stress, of the time they are spending in a",227
NA,"traffic jam, or of the train that does not run on time-is these wretched souls that are",227
NA,"languishing in detention on Manus Island and Nauru, and that all we have to do as a nation is",227
NA,"stop them coming to Australia. We could convince people that that was the truth, but that",227
NA,would be a lie.,227
NA,It is the way that we respond to these things which defines us as humans. It defines us as,227
NA,parliamentarians. It defines us as people who have been sent here to uphold the best traditions,227
NA,"of Australian democracy. Sadly, what we have seen on display over the last week is a long",227
NA,way from the eloquent words of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition when,227
NA,they brought this motion into the House two months ago. This motion is the sort of,227
NA,bipartisanship that we need. It is bipartisanship around the best traditions of Australian,227
NA,democracy and not the worst.,227
Mr KEOGH ,"Burt) (12:43): It was 20 years ago, almost to the day, that then Prime",227
NA,"Minister Howard moved a motion, first proposed by opposition leader Kim Beazley, in the",227
NA,same words as the motion we are debating today: to reaffirm the commitment of the,227
NA,Australian government and the Australian parliament to equal rights. Looking back on Mr,227
NA,"Howard's reflections in this place on that day does show that the more things change, the",227
NA,more they can stay the same. Mr Howard said:,227
NA,NA,227
NA,"It is natural that people, particularly those who feel themselves at the sharp end of challenge and",228
NA,"anxiety in industries that have seen extensive job losses, should feel some sense of anxiety about",228
NA,"immigration levels. It is our obligation to point out, where it is appropriate, the error in their",228
NA,understanding of the causation between immigration and job security.,228
NA,"It is no coincidence that the need to reaffirm this House's commitment to equal rights,",228
NA,"regardless of race, colour, creed or origin, has come at another point in our history where",228
NA,some Australians are feeling left behind and where inequality is on the rise. It is very easy for,228
NA,politicians and so-called leaders to talk to those people-those who are out of work or feeling,228
NA,the pinch of an economic downturn-about patriotism and the supposed threat of,228
NA,"immigration. It is easy to create an enemy, and to whip up fear and ride that sentiment into",228
NA,"power, but that does not solve the problem. Those people who you were talking to remain out",228
NA,"of work, down on their luck and struggling. Those who have come to Australia from across",228
NA,"the seas, most of whom have given so much to our country, are caught in the middle,",228
NA,demonised for crimes they never committed to appease people they have never met. This,228
NA,creation of fear is not leadership. It is not what we are here to do.,228
NA,"Mr Beazley, on the day this motion was first brought, impressed upon this place the need",228
NA,for leadership. He said:,228
NA,"But each time each new wave of migrants came in - whether they were from southern Europe, eastern",228
NA,"Europe, the Middle East and now more recently from Asia - there has been a requirement on the",228
NA,"political leadership in this country to point out the advantage; to mould, insofar as we can, and without",228
NA,"arrogance, community opinion that makes it acceptable and ensures that the community sustains its",228
NA,tolerant and decent traditions. There has been that requirement constantly upon us for leadership.,228
NA,"Over the past 200 years, Australia has made enormous progress on racial tolerance led by a",228
NA,series of true leaders. From a nation state born in conflict with the original inhabitants of this,228
NA,"great land-built then on a foundation of a White Australia policy-over 200 years, we have",228
NA,begun to bridge that conflict with Indigenous Australia. We have deconstructed the White,228
NA,"Australia policy. We have moved away from a sectarian society, and opened our nation up to",228
NA,immigration from Europe first and then across the globe. It would be a tragedy of the highest,228
NA,"order for us to abandon that progress, to walk away from the achievements of our forebears",228
NA,"and walk back towards the fear and hatred of a sectarian society. Right now, our country",228
NA,needs us all in this place to stand up.,228
NA,The rights expressed in this motion are what our cousins in the United States would call,228
NA,'self-evident truths'. They are the values that tie together our nations and bring together liberal,228
NA,democracies across the world. But being self evident does not mean that we do not have to,228
NA,fight for these rights. We must continue every day to press the case for a multicultural,228
NA,"Australia; that our multicultural Australia is where we celebrate the practice of many cultures,",228
NA,but always consistent with and underpinned by Australian values.,228
NA,We must remind ourselves and our constituents of the contributions that different cultures,228
NA,have made to Australia: the Irish Australians who moved here in the 19th century due to,228
NA,"famine, like my family; the Chinese at the turn of the 20th century; the Eastern European",228
NA,Australians who came out after the Second World War and helped to build the Snowy,228
NA,"Mountain Scheme, or the orchards that surround my electorate of Burt and the hills of",228
NA,"Roleystone, Karragullen and Pickering; the Vietnamese Australians who came as refugees",228
NA,"and who have become leaders across business, politics and the arts, like the South Australian",228
NA,"Governor; the Lebanese Australians, like the former New South Wales Governor; and",228
NA,NA,228
NA,"businessmen and philanthropists, and so many more, as well as those coming to Australia now",229
NA,"like those from India and South Asia, through the western areas of the electorate of Burt. All",229
NA,of these people have one thing in common: they are Australians.,229
NA,"I would close by noting another comment by Mr Howard in his speech 20 years ago,",229
NA,"which, given some of the commentary from recent days by government ministers, seems more",229
NA,striking than ever.,229
NA,I remain very fond of the fact-,229
NA,Mr Howard said-,229
NA,"that I was a member of the coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser which, in the late 1970s, chose",229
NA,to admit to this country tens of thousands of people from war-torn Indochina. Inevitably-,229
NA,Mr Howard went on-,229
NA,the character of Australia has changed as a result of this migration. Much of that change has been,229
NA,profoundly beneficial. I think this country owes an enormous debt to people who have chosen this as,229
NA,their home; people who have come from the four corners of the world.,229
NA,This motion 20 years ago articulated the Australia that we were becoming as we moved into,229
NA,"the 21st century. Today, 20 years later, the prosperity and unity of our nation relies on us",229
NA,"living the values of this motion, and I am proud to reaffirm our commitment to tolerance and",229
NA,diversity today.,229
NA,Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (12:49): This motion to reaffirm Australia's bipartisan,229
NA,"commitment to equality irrespective of race, creed, colour or origin, was moved by the Prime",229
NA,"Minister on 10 October, just 47 days ago. It was another era because, on 10 October, Donald",229
NA,"Trump was not the President-elect of the United States and Steve Bannon, a close ally of",229
NA,"America's Neo-Nazi movement, was not the new Chief Strategist in the White House. When I",229
NA,"put my name down to speak to this motion, I never intended to talk about America, but we",229
NA,must talk about it. There is a direct relevance to what is going on in America and the subject,229
NA,of this motion in Australia.,229
NA,"Before becoming Donald Trump's campaign chief of staff, Steve Bannon used to run a",229
NA,political website called Breitbart. Breitbart started out publishing news with a conservative,229
NA,viewpoint-somewhat like a hybrid of The Australian and The Daily Telegraph newspapers.,229
NA,"It was journalism but through a right-wing, wind-them-up prism with inflammatory headlines.",229
NA,"Under Bannon, Breitbart became extreme, spreading the lies about Obama not being",229
NA,"American. In July this year, Bannon bragged that he had transformed Breitbart into 'the",229
NA,platform for the alt-right movement'.,229
NA,"Because of Bannon, the alternative right and its leader, Richard Spencer, gained notoriety,",229
NA,"influence and access to the political mainstream. Last week-in fact, just days ago-a video",229
NA,emerged of an alt-right conference held in a federal building in Washington DC. This is how,229
NA,The New York Times newspaper reported Spencer's address:,229
NA,"He railed against Jews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German. America, he",229
NA,"said, belonged to white people, whom he called the ""children of the sun,"" a race of conquerors and",229
NA,"creators who had been marginalized but now, in the era of President-elect Donald J Trump, were",229
NA,"""awakening to their own identity.""",229
NA,NA,229
NA,"As he finished, several audience members had their arms outstretched in a Nazi salute. When Mr",230
NA,"Spencer, or perhaps another person standing near him at the front of the room-it was not clear who-",230
NA,"shouted, ""Heil the people! Heil victory,"" the room shouted it back.",230
NA,You do not have to take The New York Times's word for it; there is a video-Nazi salutes and,230
NA,all. So let us be clear: the alternative right is an avowed movement of white supremacists-a,230
NA,"group described by journalist Shaun King, who writes for the New York Daily News, as 'the",230
NA,"KKK without the hoods, skinheads with suits and ties'. The alt-right has been enthusiastically",230
NA,"supported by Steve Bannon, and Steve Bannon is now the chief strategist for the White",230
NA,House.,230
NA,As journalist Shaun King reported earlier today:,230
NA,"When you build, fund, and promote the online home for the modern-day Neo-Nazi movement, and",230
NA,"openly brag that you have done so, that makes you a supporter and enabler of Neo-Nazis. If someone",230
NA,"built, funded, promoted, and openly admitted to creating the online home for the latest iteration of ISIS,",230
NA,you know what they'd be called? Terrorists.,230
NA,So what does all of this have to do with Australia and the motion we are discussing today?,230
NA,"We do not live in a vacuum. We cannot ignore what is happening in America, because it is",230
NA,"happening across the Western world and it is starting to happen here-UKIP, Brexit, the",230
NA,"deeply troubling rise of Le Pen's fascist National Front in France, far-right parties in",230
NA,governing coalitions across Europe and the re-emergence of One Nation in Australia.,230
NA,"In just the past week, the immigration minister made a deplorable comment that the",230
NA,government led by Malcolm Fraser 'did make mistakes in bringing some people in'. The,230
NA,minister went on to refer to Australians as 'second and third generation migrants' and sought,230
NA,to justify his comments by stating that the children and grandchildren of Muslim migrants,230
NA,from Lebanon were overrepresented as national security threats.,230
NA,What the minister did not do was offer an explanation as to what mistake he believed the,230
NA,"Fraser government had actually made. How, for example, would he have liked the",230
NA,government of the day to screen migrants? What was it about the screening process that was,230
NA,deficient? What magical device could have screened a migrant to check whether their child or,230
NA,grandchild growing up here might turn out to be a national security threat? I wonder whether,230
NA,the minister might make this wondrous device widely available so young couples can be,230
NA,screened now to see whether their children will end up being criminals. Perhaps he can screen,230
NA,"me to tell me whether my future grandchildren will one day smoke pot-or worse, vote",230
NA,Liberal!,230
NA,The code behind the minister's reprehensible comments was that the mistake made was that,230
NA,"these migrants were Muslim or Lebanese, or both. If there is another way of reading it, I",230
NA,would like him to explain it to the parliament. So we have a minister this week criticising a,230
NA,"decision to allow Lebanese Muslim migrants into Australia when, just 47 days ago, we had",230
NA,the Prime Minister move this motion to recommit to Australia's equality principle irrespective,230
NA,"of race, colour, creed or origin. A lot sure has changed in 47 days.",230
NA,This motion is proudly supported by Labor. My preference would have been to use this,230
NA,speech to talk in more detail about the many great things that immigration has provided,230
NA,Australia and how pleased I am that a commitment to equality continues to cross the political,230
NA,"divide. After all, I am an immigrant. I arrived here in 1975, with my parents, at the age of",230
NA,"seven. My brother was four. Our family became citizens. Of course, to run for election to this",230
NA,NA,230
NA,"place, I was required to surrender my dual citizenship with the United Kingdom. But, apart",231
NA,"from being called a pom at school and learning that you do not wear socks with sandals, I",231
NA,"never really felt like an immigrant. I have always known in the back of my mind that, when",231
NA,"we talk about immigrants in this country, we are not really talking about poms or kiwis; we",231
NA,are talking about people who are not white or whose first language is not English.,231
NA,"My parents left family behind when they brought us here, but the language, culture and",231
NA,religion were largely the same. I cannot begin to imagine what it must be like for people from,231
NA,"Lebanon, whether Christian or Muslim, or the refugees from Vietnam, who arrived with just",231
NA,the shirts on their backs. But the vast majority of immigrants to this nation forged bright,231
NA,futures here. The success of Australia's immigration is testament to both the commitment of,231
NA,immigrants to their new country and Australia's willingness and ability to provide a,231
NA,"welcoming new home. In the fields of science, mathematics, business, politics, education, the",231
NA,"arts and others, immigrants and the children and grandchildren of immigrants-Australians-",231
NA,have made wondrous contributions. They deserve better than to be lumped in with the pitiful,231
NA,handful who have turned traitor.,231
NA,"I have spent much of this speech talking about what is happening in America-because, to",231
NA,"address a problem, you first have to acknowledge that there is one. And there is a problem in",231
NA,the White House when someone like Steve Bannon has the President's ear. As the Leader of,231
NA,the Opposition said in his statement in reply to the Prime Minister: 'We need to do more than,231
NA,mouth words of respect. We must thoroughly and publicly reject racism wherever it occurs,231
NA,"and whoever says it. There is no place in Australia for extremism no matter the party, no",231
NA,"matter the agenda, no matter the importance of their vote.' I too believe we must call out",231
NA,"racism when we see it, even-or perhaps especially-when it is given a home, a voice and a",231
NA,"platform at the highest political levels of our most important ally and good friend, the United",231
NA,States of America.,231
NA,Debate adjourned.,231
NA,Sitting suspended from 12:59 to 16:00,231
NA,Equal Rights,231
NA,Consideration resumed of the motion:,231
NA,That this House:,231
NA,(1) reaffirms its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with,231
NA,"equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin;",231
NA,(2) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining an immigration policy wholly non-discriminatory on,231
NA,"grounds of race, colour, creed or origin;",231
NA,(3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait,231
NA,"Islander people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage;",231
NA,"(4) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining Australia as a culturally diverse, tolerant and open",231
NA,"society, united by an overriding commitment to our nation, and its democratic institutions and values;",231
NA,and,231
NA,(5) denounces racial intolerance in any form as incompatible with the kind of society we are and,231
NA,want to be.,231
Ms VAMVAKINOU ,Calwell) (16:00): I am very pleased to be speaking to this motion,231
NA,on equal rights for all Australians that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition and,231
NA,NA,231
NA,"seconded by the Prime Minister. I want to start by saying that I was in your place, Mr Deputy",232
NA,"Speaker, just before lunch listening to many of my colleagues speak to this motion. I",232
NA,"particularly want to reflect on some of the comments that the member for Cowan made,",232
NA,clearly with a lot of emotion. She began her presentation by asking the rhetorical question:,232
NA,why in 2016 is it necessary that we talk about the preservation of rights and equality before,232
NA,the law for all Australians? I understood clearly where she was coming from. I might have,232
NA,asked myself that question too when I thought about speaking to this motion.,232
NA,We should never take for granted the battles that we have won and the society that we have,232
NA,built here in Australia-a democratic society that has enshrined in law equality for all,232
NA,"Australians regardless of their race, colour, creed or origin. We should never take for granted",232
NA,those hard-fought battles by generations of people before us and indeed members of,232
NA,parliament who were in the parliament before us. We should never take for granted that those,232
NA,battles have been won and we no longer need to concern ourselves about these inequalities. It,232
NA,"is probably not a bad idea in 2016, some 20 years after the same motion was moved by Mr",232
NA,"Howard when he was Prime Minister, to take stock and reflect on where our community is in",232
NA,relation to the laws of our land.,232
NA,I want to reflect on a couple of things. I want to reflect on the fact that this country has,232
NA,"been built by waves of migrants from all over the world, including me. We are often",232
NA,described as a modern multicultural and open society and a democratic country. There are,232
NA,currently some seven million Australians who were born overseas. There are lots of things,232
NA,"that unite us, but the one thing that enshrines our rights almost in law is the Australian",232
NA,Citizenship Act and the fact that we become Australian citizens and as Australian citizens we,232
NA,enjoy the same privileges and have the same obligations.,232
NA,We have a society that is based on some very strong institutions and laws that protect all of,232
NA,us. The Racial Discrimination Act was put in place over four decades or so ago. Laws passed,232
NA,by this parliament and other parliaments are aimed at ensuring everyone has equality and that,232
NA,we are all protected against things said by others that might be hurtful and offensive or that,232
NA,might degrade us. I understand that very much-and I understand where the member for,232
NA,"Cowan was coming from-because I grew up in this country as a foreigner, I became an",232
NA,Australian citizen and now I am in the Australian parliament. I think I represent what the,232
NA,"modern contemporary Australian is today, and I am very proud of that. Obviously I am very",232
NA,keen to ensure that nothing interferes with future generations or current generations of people,232
NA,who are working their way through the integration process here in Australia and are becoming,232
NA,Australians.,232
NA,I have often said to those in particular who are critical of multiculturalism and who argue,232
NA,that it is a divisive thing and we should abandon it-we have sporadic outbreaks of those sorts,232
NA,"of debates, and we are having one at the moment; we have had many before in the past, and",232
NA,we will overcome it in the same way that we have overcome it in the past-that,232
NA,multiculturalism for me and for many Australians is really underpinned by these laws. It is,232
NA,also a process by which people become Australians. So it is not a divisive policy; it is 4½,232
NA,decades of government policy that has over the years enjoyed bipartisanship. There have been,232
NA,"times, blips along the way, where there have been critics, but, by and large, there has been",232
NA,"bipartisanship on this issue, and I think that that is what underpins the strength of our modern",232
NA,Australian multicultural society.,232
NA,NA,232
NA,"We have also, in that mix, pursued a non-discriminatory immigration policy. We do not",233
NA,select people on the basis of their race or their colour or their creed or their origin. We do not,233
NA,"exclude them, and we do not select them on that basis. We have a non-discriminatory",233
NA,immigration policy.,233
NA,"If I look at the period when the White Australia policy was finally done away with, I see in",233
NA,my electorate in particular the great Turkish-speaking Australian community that was able to,233
NA,finally come to Australia on the abolition of the White Australia policy. I am sure that at the,233
NA,time there would have been people in my community who would have thought that this was,233
NA,"not a good thing-that we would not have wanted Turkish migrants in this country, that they",233
NA,would not have been capable of integrating or that they would have been future problem,233
NA,"makers. At the time I probably was a very young child, but I am sure that in my",233
NA,neighbourhood in Broadmeadows there were people who would not have wanted the Turks to,233
NA,come to Australia.,233
NA,But when you reflect-and we are now nearing 50 years of Turkish migration in this,233
NA,"country-it cannot be said that, with the abolition of the White Australia policy, which then",233
NA,"allowed Turks and other non-Europeans or nonwhites to come to this country, there has been",233
NA,"a detriment to the Australian community. On the contrary, my community have made a great",233
NA,"contribution, and they are continuing to make a great contribution as Australians of Turkish",233
NA,descent and as Australians of the Muslim faith. So the idea that at some point in time we,233
NA,"reflect and we say, 'We shouldn't have let those people in because there are some problems",233
NA,"today,' really puzzles me and concerns me. I will come to that a little bit later.",233
NA,The 17 per cent or so of my constituents who are of the Muslim faith do come also from,233
NA,Lebanon. I have many of them in my electorate who are actually very good Australian,233
NA,"citizens and who are making, as I said, a very good contribution as Australians to this country.",233
NA,"In addition to that, I am also very pleased that we are to welcome a very large number of",233
NA,"Iraqi Christians-in fact, the biggest number of Iraqi Christians to come to this country in",233
NA,Victoria are living in the federal seat of Calwell. They have come to live here under the,233
NA,refugee program. I have spent a lot of my time interacting with them in trying to assist them,233
NA,"and teach them about the Australian community that they have come to live in. And, yes,",233
NA,many of them come here with preconceived ideas and views about people of the Muslim faith.,233
NA,I can understand that. They have come out of the Middle East. They still have family who are,233
NA,being persecuted.,233
NA,But I have found that this is important to me as their federal member: rather than use that,233
NA,"concern and fear that they have and stir my community, I realise it is absolutely critical that",233
NA,the leadership that I show in my local community is to ensure that I help them through a,233
NA,process of settling and integrating into Australia that helps them to have a positive experience.,233
NA,"So I am very, very critical of anyone who chooses to hijack this debate and turn it into a",233
NA,political attack on other people. I am worried about the rise of a particular attitude in our,233
NA,Australian community and in this place because it has now found a political voice. I am very,233
NA,worried that succumbing to that attitude is going to be detrimental to the Australian,233
NA,community. The biggest threat to Australia's security or social cohesion is not where people,233
NA,are born; it is rather the racism that often finds expression in this country and the failure of,233
NA,leadership to reject it.,233
NA,NA,233
Mr CREWTHER ,Dunkley) (16:10): I rise today to speak on the resumption of debate on,234
NA,the motion of the Prime Minister to recognise equal rights for all Australians. As the Prime,234
NA,"Minister noted, 50 years ago Australia became an early signatory to one of the world's most",234
NA,profound declarations on human rights: the United Nations' International Convention on the,234
NA,Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. As many of my colleagues have done,234
NA,"already when speaking on this motion, I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my",234
NA,commitment to the common values that I believe in and that I believe make our nation great.,234
NA,"It is a commitment to the values which ensure that, regardless of who you are, where you are",234
NA,"from, your ethnicity, the colour of your skin, your chosen faith or your ability, no Australian",234
NA,should be denied equal opportunity. This is something that I and many Australians strive,234
NA,"towards on a daily basis. This motion, which is of great importance to our society, clearly",234
NA,outlines the values of many Australians who support the importance of equal rights for every,234
NA,"Australian, including being treated with respect regardless of ethnicity, colour, creed, origin",234
NA,or any other factor.,234
NA,This motion reaffirms our commitment to maintain Australia as a culturally diverse and,234
NA,open society united by an overriding commitment to our nation and its democratic institutions,234
NA,and values. The values recognised in this motion are common amongst many Australians-,234
NA,"for example, notions of freedom which our ADF have fought for over a long period of time.",234
NA,"Regardless of their individual background, ethnicity or location in Australia, each migrant",234
NA,"who comes here to call Australia home is, in many cases, trying to achieve success for",234
NA,themselves and their families.,234
NA,"Before I came into this place, I worked as an international lawyer through the UN at the",234
NA,"Kosovo Property Agency in the former Yugoslavia, resolving claims for people who had lost",234
NA,"possession of their properties due to the 1998-99 conflict. In Kosovo, there were about 43,000",234
NA,"claims for farms, for houses and for businesses-by people who were refugees or internally",234
NA,"displaced people, or others. We presented nearly 800 cases before an international tribunal",234
NA,every two months. This work assisted individuals and families who had become victims of a,234
NA,situation in which they were not given equal rights or opportunities in terms of the conflict. At,234
NA,"the same time, this process of property resolution also enables that nation to move forward.",234
NA,"For example, if you wish to invest in Kosovo, you want to know that the property you are",234
NA,purchasing is actually owned by the person who purports to own it. Not only is this resolution,234
NA,"process helping people to return to their properties, sell their properties or rent their",234
NA,"properties, it enables the country to move forward in investing in their future.",234
NA,"Using what I learned during this time, part of the importance of my work now as a member",234
NA,of the Australian parliament is that I can be a voice for others and contribute to the continued,234
NA,success of our country. We can uphold what so many in our history have worked towards and,234
NA,ensure that we are part of society which celebrates and values the diversity of our people and,234
NA,"the rights of all to have equal opportunities. I, like many Australians, believe in the value of",234
NA,"equality for all. In my maiden speech, I spoke about why I am a Liberal. I mentioned that I am",234
NA,"a Liberal because I believe in equality of opportunity and reward for effort. All people,",234
NA,"irrespective of background, deserve a fair go to achieve their best. I focused on this as my",234
NA,"own family, like many in our country, came from humble beginnings and would not have",234
NA,been able to succeed if our people and society did not uphold the value of equal opportunity,234
NA,for all.,234
NA,NA,234
NA,"My wife, Grace, originally came from South Korea and moved to Australia with her family",235
NA,when she was three years old. Australia opened the door for her as well as many other,235
NA,migrants from South Korea. Many South Korean migrants have been very successful in,235
NA,Australia in both integrating into Australian society and achieving success. I am proud that I,235
NA,"am able to share in my family that experience with my wife, Grace. As I mentioned in my",235
NA,"maiden speech, she experienced the detriments of communism in North Korea when her",235
NA,great-grandparents were unfortunately killed by being thrown alive into a well under the,235
NA,"communist regime. Fortunately, her family on one side were able to make it out of North",235
NA,Korea before the borders closed and then she had the opportunity later to move to Australia.,235
NA,South Korea is recognised in my electorate as well with an increase in South Korean,235
NA,"migrants locally. I was able to open recently the first South Korean restaurant in Dunkley,",235
NA,"which is called Geonbae, which means 'cheers'. We are proud as a nation to have common",235
NA,"values supported by all Australians, such as the importance of a fair go for all. Like my",235
NA,"family, Dunkley locals are hardworking and aspirational, wanting the best for themselves and",235
NA,their families. That is why I believe in equality of opportunity. My electorate of Dunkley is,235
NA,full of people from vibrant cultural backgrounds and faiths. The make-up of Dunkley has a,235
NA,"majority who were born in Australia. However, we also have a significant population of",235
NA,"people who were born in England, New Zealand, Scotland, Germany, India, the Netherlands,",235
NA,"South Africa, Italy, China, Ireland, the Philippines, the United States of America, Greece,",235
NA,"Poland and more, as well as many whose parents also came from these nations.",235
NA,"In September this year I had the privilege of hosting Senator the Hon. Arthur Sinodinos,",235
NA,"the cabinet secretary, to my electorate. A part of Senator Sinodinos's visit to Frankston",235
NA,included meeting with the Frankston Greek Senior Citizens Club-a fantastic group of people,235
NA,who have made our community their home. Some made the Frankston community their home,235
NA,several generations ago and others in recent years. The fact that our society supports the rights,235
NA,"of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with respect, regardless of ethnicity,",235
NA,"colour, creed or origin, means that I was able to hear so many success stories from the",235
NA,"members of the Greek senior citizens, many of whom came to Australia with very little but",235
NA,"were able to make the most of the opportunities our community had to offer, while also",235
NA,"contributing to and giving back to the community in many ways, which we hope that all",235
NA,migrants to our country can do. The Australian way of ensuring equality of opportunity for all,235
NA,"and a fair go has meant that Australia is full of vibrant, culturally diverse communities-",235
NA,something which has made our country and communities so much greater.,235
NA,Another example in my local electorate of Dunkley is the Ahmadiyyan Muslim,235
NA,"community, with their mosque in Langwarrin. The Ahmadiyyan Muslim community is a part",235
NA,of the overall Islamic faith and in many Islamic countries is persecuted. Many have sought,235
NA,refuge in Australia and in many other countries around the world. They are an example of a,235
NA,community which has integrated locally in my electorate and is presenting a message which,235
NA,preaches love instead of hate.,235
NA,"We have a proud history as an immigration nation. Each year over 200,000 immigrants, as",235
NA,"well as over 18,000 refugees and people coming through the humanitarian program, make",235
NA,"Australia their home. That makes nearly 220,000 people, which is nearly one per cent of",235
NA,"Australia's population, each year. Australia should be proud of its generous contribution in the",235
NA,"world in settling migrants and refugees and others, particularly in terms of our settlement",235
NA,NA,235
NA,services and our ability to integrate people into Australian society. We must continue to show,236
NA,order and continue to improve our settlement processes through our immigration programs,236
NA,and our actions recently through the great work of the Minister for Immigration and Border,236
NA,"Protection, Peter Dutton, and assistant minister, Alex Hawke. If we control our borders and",236
NA,"ensure an orderly process, that enables trust by the Australian people in our processes, which",236
NA,can increase generosity towards both migrants and refugees. This assists with further,236
NA,"settlement into the future, in terms of settling those refugees and migrants, and we can",236
NA,continue to improve our settlement and other processes.,236
NA,"The ADF also do a great job, not only in Australia but around the world, in terms of",236
NA,preventing conflict at its source and in terms of protecting the freedoms that we all take for,236
NA,granted. This is part of our global efforts to stem the tide of those seeking refuge elsewhere.,236
NA,We currently have the largest population of refugees and internally displaced people around,236
NA,"the world of more than 65 million people, which is greater than after World War II. We all",236
NA,"have a responsibility, not only in Australia but in other countries, to enable the settlement of",236
NA,these people and to help resolve the issue.,236
NA,I am proud as an Australian and as part of this parliament to support equality of,236
NA,"opportunity, and I commend the Prime Minister's speech and this motion to the chamber.",236
Mr DREYFUS ,Isaacs-Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (16:20): This year,236
NA,"marks the 41st anniversary of the Racial Discrimination Act, one of the great legacies of the",236
NA,"Whitlam government. Passed in 1975, the Racial Discrimination Act makes it an offence to",236
NA,"discriminate against a person because of their race, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin,",236
NA,"or immigrant status. The act, of course, gave effect to some of Australia's international",236
NA,"obligations under CERD, the Covenant for the Elimination of all forms of Racial",236
NA,"Discrimination, and under the ICCPR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political",236
NA,Rights.,236
NA,Diversity is what makes Australia great. We do not merely tolerate or accept,236
NA,multiculturalism; we welcome and embrace it. Every new community that has come to this,236
NA,wide brown land of ours has added its own unique culture to the great multicultural fabric that,236
NA,is modern Australia. This diversity makes our great country stronger. It offers all Australians,236
NA,"the chance to learn about the customs and traditions of others, making us all wiser and more",236
NA,civilised as a result. I cannot imagine an Australia that is not the multicultural community that,236
NA,"it is today, because this is what we have become over the many decades of successive waves",236
NA,"of immigration to our country. The multiplicity of cultures that we see around us, particularly",236
NA,"in our great cities, makes Australia an extraordinarily distinctive culture. Very, very few",236
NA,countries in the world can boast of the multicultural diversity that we have in our country.,236
NA,I welcome the Prime Minister's words in this House about his commitment to an,236
NA,"immigration policy which is wholly non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, colour, creed",236
NA,or origin. I also welcome the Prime Minister's denunciation of racial intolerance in any form,236
NA,as being incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to be. I trust that the Prime,236
NA,Minister's words will be followed by swift action in support of the laws and policies that,236
NA,"uphold the commitments that are contained in his words, including upholding section 18C of",236
NA,"the Racial Discrimination Act, which provides protection for all Australians from being",236
NA,vilified because of their race or ethnic origin. It is exceptionally disappointing that the right-,236
NA,"wing fringe of Australian politics, including some coalition MPs, have chosen to renew their",236
NA,NA,236
NA,attack on a law which has served Australia particularly well in the 21 years that it has been,237
NA,part of our law.,237
NA,I note that the Prime Minister has yet to respond to a letter written by the Leader of the,237
NA,Opposition inviting him to join all members of the Labor caucus in signing a parliamentarians',237
NA,code of race and cultural ethics which pledges to discuss racial issues in a truthful and,237
NA,respectful way. This parliamentarians' code of race and cultural ethics is built on a document,237
NA,"to very, very similar effect instigated by Senator Margaret Reynolds from Queensland in",237
NA,"1996, signed by very many members of both houses of the Australian parliament by 1998,",237
NA,"which was prompted by what was, on any view, an outbreak of racial intolerance that had the",237
NA,potential to threaten the course and conduct of debate in this parliament. It is prompted by the,237
NA,potential for that same outbreak of racial intolerance that this new parliamentarians' code of,237
NA,race and cultural ethics has been brought into existence. I very much hope that the Prime,237
NA,Minister and the members of the joint coalition party room do respond to the invitation that,237
NA,has been extended by the Leader of the Opposition. What the Prime Minister's words in this,237
NA,"House should lead to, but have not to date, is a swift denunciation of the member for",237
NA,Dickson's recent derogatory and uninformed comments about communities that came to our,237
NA,country under the Fraser government. The words that he has used when speaking of 'second-,237
NA,and third-generation migrants' demonstrate his ignorance. The children and grandchildren of,237
NA,"migrants are not secondand third-generation migrants; they are Australians, and the member",237
NA,"for Dickson should recognise that. He should be ashamed, as the immigration minister, of the",237
NA,phrases he has used.,237
NA,"The member for Dickson's other statements, about the supposed immigration mistakes of",237
NA,"the Fraser government, are equally ignorant and, of course, divisive. Let me make this entirely",237
NA,clear to the government and to the Australian public: Labor does not think the successive,237
NA,waves of immigration to this great country of ours were a mistake. When I walk down,237
NA,"Douglas Street in Noble Park, one of the great multicultural hubs of my electorate, I see the",237
NA,successes of multiculturalism. When I talk to the Vietnamese Australian cafe owner or the,237
NA,"Sudanese Australian butcher, I see the opportunities that Australia offers and the diversity and",237
NA,success that multiculturalism brings. When I speak to the Mayor of the City of Greater,237
NA,"Dandenong, my friend Jim Memeti, who came to Australia from Albania at the age of two,",237
NA,and who built a successful business while giving his time to his community as a councillor for,237
NA,"the last 11 years, I see the success of Australian multiculturalism. All three of these people are",237
NA,"dedicated, hardworking people who give their time and their labour to make our great country",237
NA,even better. Nobody who met these people would think that their coming to Australia was a,237
NA,mistake. Each one of them has created jobs for Australians and has contributed in many ways,237
NA,to our community. And everywhere I go in my electorate I see that cultural diversity. People,237
NA,"from over 180 nations have made their home in my electorate, and many other electorates in",237
NA,Australia can say exactly the same thing.,237
NA,"What is distinctive about the Australian community, notwithstanding the incredible number",237
NA,"of countries across the world from which Australians have come, is the harmony in which that",237
NA,"amazing diversity is able to exist. Elected representatives, and in particular ministers in the",237
NA,"government of our great country, have a responsibility to set a standard of acceptance and",237
NA,civility for all Australians. I would be greatly saddened if the 'ignorant' and 'alarmist',237
NA,comments by the member for Dickson-and I am there quoting the former Fraser government,237
NA,NA,237
NA,minister Ian Macphee-were to be considered acceptable by young and impressionable,238
NA,Australians. We have to be particularly careful to speak in this place with care and,238
NA,"compassion, and not with a view to divide and inflame, because, when an elected",238
NA,"representative speaks, their words and their beliefs are legitimised by the very fact that an",238
NA,elected representative speaks them. I say again: there is a particular responsibility cast on,238
NA,"elected representatives, particularly on ministers, to choose their words with care, and not-",238
NA,and this goes particularly for a minister of immigration in this country-to use words that,238
NA,have the capacity to divide and inflame and excite prejudice. The immigration minister of this,238
NA,"country is the last minister who should be using the kind of language that, regrettably, the",238
NA,"member for Dickson has used in the last week and, might I say, has gone on using despite the",238
NA,storm of criticism that has rightly erupted over the comments that he made.,238
NA,"Multiculturalism is the success of hope over fear, of opportunity over apprehension and of",238
NA,"reaching out instead of staying in. As a proud Labor member and, more importantly, as a",238
NA,"proud Australian, I stand here today in defence of multiculturalism, in defence of diversity",238
NA,and in defence of the continued commitment to denounce racial intolerance in any form as,238
NA,incompatible with the kind of society we are and want to be. What we need to hear from the,238
NA,"government of our country, not just from the opposition, is the same defence of",238
NA,multiculturalism and diversity. What we need to hear is a sustained rejection of racial,238
NA,intolerance in any form-and not merely on occasions like the occasion of this motion jointly,238
NA,sponsored by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Every time a minister,238
NA,"speaks, every time an elected representative speaks, whether within this parliament or",238
NA,"without, we need to hear a defence of multiculturalism and diversity.",238
NA,Instead of attacking the Australian Human Rights Commission the Prime Minister and the,238
NA,Attorney-General need to be defending that statutory agency when it carries out the statutory,238
NA,functions that it is charged to do. Instead of attacking the provisions of the Racial,238
NA,"Discrimination Act which gives effect to Australia's obligation to outlaw race hate speech, the",238
NA,government should be upholding those provisions. (Time expired),238
Mr HOWARTH ,Petrie) (16:30): I rise to speak on this motion today which has,238
NA,"bipartisan support across the parliament. Of course, I follow the member for Isaacs. It is a",238
NA,shame that he has chosen once again to attack the Minister for Immigration and Border,238
NA,Protection like he does so often. The member for Isaacs cannot help but engage in grubby,238
NA,politics in relation to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. He should 'take the,238
NA,"'log out of his own eye' because, in parliament, the member for Isaacs loves to divide, as do a",238
NA,lot of members on the Labor Party side. The question that was put to the Minister for,238
NA,Immigration and Border Protection by the Labor Party the other day had as its very purpose to,238
NA,"divide, to try and find a weakness, to get the minister to say something that they could exploit",238
NA,politically. That is the truth of the matter. It is absolutely grubby politics from those opposite.,238
NA,A division having been called in the House of Representatives-,238
NA,Sitting suspended from 16:32 to 16:45,238
Mr HOWARTH," As I was saying before, I was calling out the member for Isaacs for his",238
NA,divisive comments on this issue around the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I,238
NA,"know the minister for immigration personally, and he is a very good man who cares deeply",238
NA,about his portfolio and cares deeply about Australian people from all walks of life. He has,238
NA,NA,238
NA,"done a great service to this country in his role. He has saved lives, particularly in relation to",239
NA,stopping people smugglers.,239
NA,"This motion, of course, I do support. That issue was originally raised by the Leader of the",239
NA,Opposition. That was in relation to the fact that there were new One Nation senators in this,239
NA,place. I would have chosen to just ignore that fact. I think we already had strong bipartisan,239
NA,"support on this issue. But I do support the motion, which the Leader of the Opposition and of",239
NA,course the Prime Minister have spoken on.,239
NA,I believe Australia is a great country. It is the greatest country in the world to live in. We,239
NA,"have a strong democracy, with freedom of race and religion. As a federal member of",239
NA,"parliament, I have had the privilege of participating in many local citizenship ceremonies. It is",239
NA,great to see so many people wanting to move to Australia and embrace Australian citizenship.,239
NA,People want to come here. They want to live here. They want to build their lives here because,239
NA,Australia is a country of opportunity.,239
NA,"When I go to citizenship ceremonies in my electorate, I see how happy they are. People",239
NA,"from right around the world, from different races, from different religions, take this pledge,",239
NA,where they say:,239
NA,"From this time forward, under God, I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic",239
NA,"beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey.",239
NA,"If people become citizens and they mean that pledge and they embrace Australia, we welcome",239
NA,"them with open arms. People need, of course, to respect our country and culture, and they do,",239
NA,"even if people come from parts of Asia, parts of the Middle East, India or wherever they are",239
NA,"from. Yes, of course, they hang on to some of their own traditions and beliefs from where",239
NA,"they were born, the food they eat and everything else, but many of them make a big effort to",239
NA,adopt the Australian way of life and to learn and speak English as well. It is very important.,239
NA,They love this country very much.,239
NA,"I think of Manmeet Sharma, an Indian bus driver who was murdered in Brisbane just a",239
NA,couple of weeks ago. I gave a speech on him in this place. He was a bus driver in Brisbane.,239
NA,He had a great work ethic. He worked really hard. He often helped new Indian people settle in,239
NA,to become Australian citizens here. He spoke at local functions in the electorate where he,239
NA,"lived, and he sang as well. He was an Indian man-born Indian-who just settled into the",239
NA,Australian way of life and embraced it very much. What happened to him was an absolute,239
NA,tragedy.,239
NA,I think of the Indian community where I spoke. There is a big Indian community in my,239
NA,"electorate, particularly in the southern end. They had a memorial service for Manmeet the",239
NA,"other day. They are Aussie people who love this country, and they play a big role in our area",239
NA,here.,239
NA,"In relation to Indigenous people as well, section (3) of the motion is:",239
NA,(3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,239
NA,"people, in the context of redressing their profound social and economic disadvantage …",239
NA,"We know that a previous Prime Minister, the 26th Prime Minister of Australia, said sorry to",239
NA,"the Indigenous people, and that went a long way to reconciliation. We love Indigenous",239
NA,people. I know quite a few. I have a big Indigenous community in the northern part of my,239
NA,"electorate, up around Deception Bay, and they play an important role.",239
NA,NA,239
NA,There are some great Indigenous Australians who have been succeeding at a high level for,240
NA,a long time. Not all Indigenous people are disadvantaged. I think of our first Indigenous,240
NA,"senator in this place, the first Indigenous parliamentarian in the Australian parliament, a",240
NA,"Liberal senator from Queensland, the honourable Neville Bonner, who had little formal",240
NA,"schooling, leaving school after he attained the third grade, apparently. In 1971, he became the",240
NA,first Aboriginal person to sit in the Commonwealth parliament when he was chosen to fill a,240
NA,vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of a Liberal senator for Queensland. Of,240
NA,"course, Neville Bonner was returned at subsequent elections, from 1972 right through to",240
NA,"1980. Recently, his niece, Senator Joanna Lindgren, was also elected as a Queensland senator",240
NA,"to this place. She is not here now, but she was elected.",240
NA,"Last Thursday, we saw the release of the seventh Overcoming Indigenous disadvantage",240
NA,report from the Productivity Commission. The report found that significant progress has been,240
NA,"made across education, health and economic participation. The Minister for Indigenous",240
NA,"Affairs, Nigel Scullion, 'said the progress was the result of concerted effort across",240
NA,"government, but a great deal more needed to be done to address Indigenous disadvantage,",240
NA,including building the evidence of what worked'. He said that 'there are positives to take out,240
NA,"of the report', specifically, reducing mortality rates of children, increasing year 12 attainment",240
NA,"rates and school participation, and improving Indigenous employment rates and that 'this is",240
NA,"good news and should be celebrated'. As the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, coalition",240
NA,"minister Nigel Scullion, said:",240
NA,The progress we have made in these areas is a positive development and critical to overcoming,240
NA,"Indigenous disadvantage, but … there is … more to be done.",240
NA,He praised all levels of government and different governments for their help.,240
NA,"Of course, unless you are an Indigenous person, you came to Australia as a migrant or are a",240
NA,descendant of immigrants. We are a multicultural society. This is the foundation Australia,240
NA,"was built on, and this does make Australia great. We have all benefited from it, and we all",240
NA,"embrace it, whether it is eating out at Thai, Chinese, Indian-whatever it is, we are happy to",240
NA,embrace it.,240
NA,I want to talk quickly about the Asian work ethic because I know that Asians are some of,240
NA,"the most hardworking people around. In my business, some of my customers ran Vietnamese",240
NA,"bakeries, and these men and women used to come in at three o'clock in the morning to start",240
NA,their bakery and would not leave until eight o'clock at night. This went on seven days a week.,240
NA,"I said to a guy I know, Tran, who runs the bakery at Banyo, 'When was the last time you had a",240
NA,"holiday?' and he said, 'Five years ago.' These people have a wonderful work ethic, and they",240
NA,really do make a big difference.,240
NA,"I remember that in primary school, in years 2 and 3 at St Flannan's at Zillmere, there were a",240
NA,"couple of brothers, Fretz and Jonathan. They were from the Philippines. They were very well",240
NA,respected by our classmates. When I trained in judo from the age of seven right through to my,240
NA,"early 20s, I represented Queensland with a good friend of mine, a guy called Jason Gavin,",240
NA,"whose mum was Malaysian. I mention that because, as a man in my 40s, I have grown up in a",240
NA,"multicultural society, and we never looked upon these people that I grew up with as anything",240
NA,"different than Aussies. Yes, they might have been born in a different country, but they were",240
NA,"Australians. We are a country of opportunity, and, for anyone who wishes to make their mark",240
NA,"in the story of Australia, we welcome them. I support the motion.",240
NA,NA,240
Ms CHESTERS ,"Bendigo) (16:53): This is an important motion, and it is good to see",241
NA,members of the government add their names to the list to show their support for the words,241
NA,that have been moved in the House. It is a very important reminder at this time in Australian,241
NA,politics that this House recommits to equal rights for all Australians and reaffirms its support,241
NA,"for all Australians to enjoy equal rights and to be treated with respect regardless of race,",241
NA,"colour, creed or origin.",241
NA,I know that a number of MPs have stood in this place and said that one of the joys of being,241
NA,"a federal member is being able to participate in citizenship ceremonies, and I too would like",241
NA,to add my voice to that call. We in the City of Greater Bendigo have had just over 280 people,241
NA,in our area take the pledge to become new Australian citizens. I know that that is not as many,241
NA,as in other electorates around the country. I know that in some electorates there are that many,241
NA,at every citizenship ceremony. But in Bendigo that is the number of people we were proud to,241
NA,celebrate taking the step to become Australian citizens.,241
NA,They have come from many countries to make Australia and Bendigo their home. We have,241
NA,asylum seekers and refugees from Myanmar. We have a number of skilled migrants from Sri,241
NA,"Lanka, Bangladesh and India. We also have a number of people who have lived in Australia",241
NA,"for a very long time but only recently decided, even though they identify as Australian, to take",241
NA,"that step to become Australian citizens-people from New Zealand, the UK and the",241
NA,Netherlands.,241
NA,In our part of the world we celebrate this event. It is always covered by the local media.,241
NA,There is always joy. There is a lot of nervousness. People are encouraged to wear dress from,241
NA,their original country at the citizenship ceremony. We hold these ceremonies not just in,241
NA,Bendigo; we also hold these ceremonies in the Macedon Ranges and Mount Alexander but,241
NA,less frequently than in Bendigo. It is a way that we in our community celebrate and,241
NA,acknowledge our diversity. It is important that we in this place reflect and respect that,241
NA,diversity not just when we speak in citizenship ceremonies but every day that we are members,241
NA,of parliament.,241
NA,"When I get the great privilege to speak at these events-in fact, at any event in our",241
NA,community where we celebrate our diversity and the many cultures that make up the,241
NA,Australian culture-I talk about how Australia is a rich tapestry of many cultures woven,241
NA,together to form the Australian culture. We do that through the traditional way-through,241
NA,"food, music and sharing stories. We always encourage each other to share our stories and our",241
NA,journeys because that is the true Australian culture-many cultures woven together.,241
NA,"Unfortunately, in Bendigo in the last few years we have had a few people invade our town",241
NA,"and suggest that we are not a multicultural community, that we are not diverse and that we do",241
NA,not celebrate our diversity. The City of Greater Bendigo just over two years ago quite proudly,241
NA,approved the first application to build our city's first mosque. We have a growing Muslim,241
NA,Australian community in Bendigo and they did not have a place of their own in which to,241
NA,worship. They put forward plans to build a community centre that contained a small mosque.,241
NA,"Unfortunately, the United Patriots Front, Reclaim Australia and a few other groups boarded",241
NA,trains to Bendigo and drove to Bendigo to protest against the building of the first mosque.,241
NA,These people were outrageous and at times violent. The United Patriots Front staged a mock,241
NA,beheading of a dummy out the front of the Bendigo city chambers. They posted this on,241
NA,"Facebook. Whilst many community leaders and political leaders, people like me, condemned",241
NA,NA,241
NA,"the video at the time, we really struggled to get Facebook to take down the video. This goes to",242
NA,the role of social media in this space. We note what happened recently in the United States.,242
NA,I hope that Facebook takes these concerns seriously because the people involved in this,242
NA,incident have since been charged by Victorian Police for serious religious vilification. We,242
NA,welcome that because it is very important that people in Bendigo and in Australia are not,242
NA,subject to the kind of vilification that this group have been pushing for. They say that people,242
NA,who practise the Muslim faith are not Australians. They are wrong. They say people who pray,242
NA,"in mosques are not Australians. They are wrong. It says very clearly in our Constitution, very",242
NA,"clearly in a number of our federal laws, that people are free in this country to practise their",242
NA,"religion. That is one of the reasons I want to speak to this motion, to reiterate my strong",242
NA,support for maintaining respect within this place.,242
NA,"Whilst this group's actions have been broadly condemned by many in politics, you can see",242
NA,how these groups do not see what they are doing is wrong when they are being encouraged by,242
NA,comments that are made by our immigration minister. His words in question time sent alarm,242
NA,"bells and shock waves through our community, and it was not just in question time but also",242
NA,during the recent federal election. When the immigration minister said that refugees are,242
NA,"clogging up our Medicare system, clogging up our unemployment system and taking",242
NA,"Australian jobs in the way that he did, he did it purely and simply to incite fear and push",242
NA,"people's buttons within our community. He is not being inclusive, he is not respecting our",242
NA,rules and he is not respecting the fact that we celebrate diversity and migration in our country.,242
NA,This week he also spoke about Australians who have Lebanese heritage.,242
NA,I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the way political leaders and members of,242
NA,parliament have taken to Twitter to tell the immigration minister why he should be sacked and,242
NA,"to also tell him about their history. I would like to acknowledge Jackie Trad, the Deputy",242
NA,"Premier of Queensland; Marlene Kairouz, a member of parliament in Victoria; and Steve",242
NA,"Bracks, the former and much-loved Premier of Victoria-who all say they are proud",242
NA,Lebanese Australians. But let's make it clear: they are Australians with Lebanese heritage. My,242
NA,"parents are from England, but I do not go around saying that I am a proud English Australian.",242
NA,I say that I am Australian with parents who were born in England. It is the same for these,242
NA,three celebrated MPs-they are Australians with Lebanese heritage.,242
NA,Migrants built our country; it is the history of who we are. It is important that all of us,242
NA,"always practise that when we stand and make comments, that we are being true to that; that",242
NA,we reaffirm our commitment to maintaining a migration policy that is wholly non-,242
NA,"discriminatory on grounds of race, colour, creed or origin. I want to see the immigration",242
NA,"minister recommit to that, a value that for so long has been bipartisan but just this week we",242
NA,have seen him tear that up and go for the cheap political shots. He should be ashamed and,242
NA,apologise for his comments. He is saying these things to invoke fear and division in our,242
NA,community and that is something we should never accept in this place or the other place.,242
Ms FLINT ,Boothby) (17:03): I am delighted to support this motion put by the Prime,242
NA,Minister today. Equality before the law is one of the fundamental pillars of our liberal,242
NA,democracy and one that I certainly support and hope that all members in this place and the,242
NA,"other do as well. Hailing from South Australia, I am conscious of the nature of my state's",242
NA,"founding, 180 years ago this year. I attended our Proclamation Day ceremony at Glenelg on",242
NA,28 December last year and I thoroughly commend it to all South Australians and indeed,242
NA,NA,242
NA,"anyone visiting my home state over Christmas. As a free settled state, the only one in the",243
NA,"nation, as we like to proudly remind everybody else, and a place that was to be the",243
NA,embodiment of the best qualities that British society had to offer-economic freedom and,243
NA,"prosperity, freedom of association and the right to be free from religious persecution-I am a",243
NA,"very proud South Australia. This is important because freedom, I believe, is a most thorough",243
NA,and capable instrument that we may use to achieve equality.,243
NA,South Australia was founded as a utopia for free settlers. It was home to many who were,243
NA,fleeing religious persecution from Prussia. Lutherans settled in and around the Adelaide Hills,243
NA,"and the Barossa Valley, and wrote one of the first of many chapters in Australia's colourful",243
NA,and successful multicultural history. We have German migrants to thank for so much of our,243
NA,wonderful wine and food. It must also be highlighted that South Australia's proclamation was,243
NA,the only proclamation in the nation which included safeguards for Aboriginal Australians and,243
NA,"their descendants, and thus proclaimed rights-albeit, rudimentary-for our First Australians.",243
NA,"Closer to home for me, South Australia was also the first jurisdiction in Australia to legislate",243
NA,for women's suffrage and the only state to grant women the right to vote and to stand for,243
NA,parliament at the same time.,243
NA,I mentioned that part of what we offered in South Australia was economic freedom and,243
NA,"prosperity, and there is no greater tool to achieve equality than through freedom. One of our",243
NA,best examples of this was under the leadership of Sir Thomas Playford. Throughout the post-,243
NA,"World War II migration era, South Australia's population exploded with non-English-",243
NA,"speaking migrants, who have made a wonderful contribution to our state. Their inclusion in",243
NA,South Australia's life and community was facilitated by the demand for workers to work in,243
NA,the factories and in our economy at the time. These industrious migrants and their children,243
NA,"have achieved equality and integrated properly into Australian life, and the credit must go to",243
NA,the principles of the Liberal democracy that my state and our nation were founded on.,243
NA,"Half a century later, and Australia is still a place of refuge for those fleeing persecution.",243
NA,"While the world is a far more complex place now, and our immigration practices have",243
NA,"needed to keep pace, the principles of providing refuge to those who need it remain the same",243
NA,and are stronger than ever. Australia's humanitarian program is global and non-,243
NA,"discriminatory. Last financial year, the government's refugee and humanitarian program",243
NA,"delivered a total of 17,555 places, which included 15,552 offshore places. This is the largest",243
NA,"offshore intake in more than 30 years. The number of special humanitarian program places,",243
NA,"visas for families of Australians in refugee-like situations offshore, has grown from 503",243
NA,"places in 2012-13 to 7,268 places in 2015-16. At the same time, the number of illegal",243
NA,"maritime arrivals taking place under the program has fallen from 4,994 in the last period of",243
NA,Labor to one in 2015-16. Australia's annual refugee and humanitarian program will grow to,243
NA,"18,750 by 2018-19, one of the most generous permanent resettlement programs in the world.",243
NA,The coordinated efforts of the Australian government agencies and international partners have,243
NA,led to a steady flow of visa grants to Syrians and Iraqis from Australia's annual humanitarian,243
NA,"program, an additional 12,000 humanitarian places. As a result, the number of Syrian and",243
NA,Iraqi humanitarian entrants arriving in Australia has also increased. The Department of,243
NA,Immigration and Border Protection and the Department of Social Services continue to work in,243
NA,close cooperation to ensure that post-arrival settlement services and supports are in place to,243
NA,assist people as they arrive in Australia.,243
NA,NA,243
NA,It is important to note that we could not afford to be as generous in our refugee intake had,244
NA,"we not managed to get our borders under control. Unfortunately, due to the failed Rudd-",244
NA,"Gillard-Rudd Labor governments, our nation completely lost control of our borders and we",244
NA,incurred billions of dollars of spending. There was something like an $11 billion budget,244
NA,"blowout as a result of this. Far worse than any monetary impact was the loss of 1,200 lives at",244
NA,sea. The moment I realised how crucial it was to have our borders under control was when I,244
NA,"saw the footage, in 2010, of the 50 people who drowned in very rough seas off Christmas",244
NA,"Island. Having grown up on the coast, along a coastline pretty similar to that of Christmas",244
NA,"Island, it was one of the most devastating things I have ever seen. We cannot allow it to",244
NA,happen ever again; we just cannot.,244
NA,"The results of stronger borders are clear: in the last six years of the Howard government,",244
NA,"for example, just 288 illegal immigrants made it to Australia by boat. In the six years of Labor",244
NA,"and the Greens, 50,000 people flooded in via 800 successful people-smuggling ventures, and,",244
NA,"as I have mentioned, 1,200 people were tragically lost at sea. I am very proud to say that,",244
NA,"under the coalition government's policies, no boats have arrived in Australia for 840 days.",244
NA,"There are no children in detention. That number is down from 8,000 children who were held",244
NA,in detention under Labor's policies. There have been 17 detention centres closed. This means,244
NA,that we can now take more refugees from refugee camps who have been waiting patiently for,244
NA,a better life here in our wonderful country. We have been able to assist those refugees from,244
NA,Iraq and Syria.,244
NA,I think it is very important to note that our migration program does not discriminate on the,244
NA,"basis of ethnicity or religion. The purpose of migration is to build the economy, shape society,",244
NA,"support the labour market, reunite families and provide protection in accordance with",244
NA,"Australia's protection obligations. The contribution of migrants to Australian society, culture",244
NA,and prosperity has been an important factor in shaping our nation. I hope that everyone in this,244
NA,place and the other place are acutely aware that we were all migrants once. My earliest South,244
NA,Australian forebears arrived in my home state in 1838-two years after settlement. They did,244
NA,"their small part to help build South Australia's economy and community, as migrants do every",244
NA,single day.,244
NA,"Today, our migration program is designed to meet Australia's economic and social needs. It",244
NA,"includes the skilled stream, the family stream and the special eligibility stream, along with the",244
NA,humanitarian component for refugees and others in humanitarian need. The size and,244
NA,composition of the permanent migration program is flexible and changes over time. It has,244
NA,changed from a smaller program with mostly family migrants in 1993-94 to a larger program,244
NA,"with more skilled migrants in recent years. In recent years, roughly two-thirds of people",244
NA,migrating to Australia were skilled migrants and about one-third were from family visa,244
NA,"streams. The total migration program outcome for 2014-15 was approximately 190,000",244
NA,"places, compared to 62,800 in 1993-94. In recent years, the major source countries in the",244
NA,"migration program have been India, China and the United Kingdom. We welcome all of these",244
NA,migrants.,244
NA,I am sure everyone in this place would join with me in saying that one of the great,244
NA,"privileges of being a member of parliament is going to citizenship ceremonies, welcoming",244
NA,new people into our communities and acknowledging the very rich contribution that our new,244
NA,citizens make to our culture and that our migrants have made to our culture and our,244
NA,NA,244
NA,community over the years. I again commend the Prime Minister's motion. I congratulate the,245
NA,Prime Minister and our current and former ministers for immigration for the work that they,245
NA,"have done, particularly in securing our borders and making sure no lives are ever again lost at",245
NA,sea as a result of a government policy in this country.,245
Mr DRUM ,Murray) (17:13): I too would like to echo the words of the member for,245
NA,Boothby in relation to the incredible success that we have had in stopping the boats and the,245
NA,humanitarian aspect of that-saving lives at sea. We know that we still have a lot of work to,245
NA,"do in this area. We can see that, sometimes, in these worldwide crises, we move the issue",245
NA,"from our local oceans to the Mediterranean. We still have a worldwide issue, and we have a",245
NA,"lot of work that needs to be done. However, it is great to see that we were able to work",245
NA,"through this very complex issue. Everybody knows that, as soon as Australia blinks in relation",245
NA,"to relaxing the current laws, the people smugglers will seize every opportunity to kickstart",245
NA,"their industry once again. The better a job we do in protecting our borders, the more",245
NA,humanitarian and generous our legal intake of refugees can be.,245
NA,It was with great pride that I had the opportunity to speak on the Prime Minister's motion,245
NA,about the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect,245
NA,"regardless of race, colour, creed or origin-and you can throw religion in there or whatever.",245
NA,"Certainly, we are all privileged to live in this country. Only once people have travelled",245
NA,overseas does the real benefit of growing up in a country like Australia hit home. To have so,245
NA,"many freedoms-to not have to worry about being attacked on the way to school, to not have",245
NA,to worry about being treated as a second-class citizen- is something we take for granted in,245
NA,this country.,245
NA,We also need to look very carefully at our Indigenous peoples because we have not brought,245
NA,them along in the same way that other countries have been able to do. You need only look,245
NA,across to New Zealand; they seem to have been able to bring their Maori population along in,245
NA,a different way from what we have been able to do with our Indigenous peoples. Shepparton,245
NA,"and the Goulburn Valley has a very strong cohort of Indigenous people, and there are some",245
NA,significant issues in this area as well. I am lucky to have very good relationships with,245
NA,"Aboriginal community leaders, who are able to enunciate a very clear vision for their people",245
NA,and have created so many positive initiatives within the Goulburn Valley and the Shepparton,245
NA,region. It is incredibly important that we continue to work with our Aboriginal communities,245
NA,to make sure that they are given every opportunity to pick up the education that most of us,245
NA,take for granted and to look at how we can give them employment opportunities that will,245
NA,"change their lives, if we are able to do that.",245
NA,"Today I had the great pleasure of hosting my friend Kevin Sheedy, who was up here",245
NA,spruiking the benefits of a country round of football for next year. Every time you get Kevin,245
NA,"Sheedy on his own, he wants to talk about the Indigenous players that he was able to nurture,",245
NA,teach and encourage-and they repaid him in spades with brilliant football and brilliant,245
NA,careers. He was certainly able to increase the profile of Indigenous Australians within the,245
NA,"sport of Australian rules football. Prior to Kevin Sheedy coming in as a coach in the eighties,",245
NA,we might have had 30 or 40 Indigenous AFL players. But within a short 20 years we have,245
NA,"now had over 350 Indigenous AFL players-and they continue to bedazzle all of us. Again,",245
NA,that was just one man's passion to bring out their absolute talents.,245
NA,NA,245
NA,"Getting back to the Murray electorate and, in particular, the Goulburn Valley, it has always",246
NA,"had a diverse multicultural break-up and mix. Growing up there as a school child, I had",246
NA,"friends from every different European country. It did not matter whether they were Greeks,",246
NA,"Italians, Macedonians or Albanians. Many people from European countries who migrated to",246
NA,Australia after the Second World War came directly to Shepparton. They gave Shepparton a,246
NA,"very multicultural feel, even before any of us knew what the word 'multicultural' meant. That",246
NA,"sense has continued to grow; in fact, it is changed quite significantly. We still have all of",246
NA,"those populations but in recent years we have had increased numbers arriving from Malaysia,",246
NA,"Indonesia and Sri Lanka. With the break-up of Yugoslavia, we had more and more arrivals",246
NA,from those European areas. And in recent years we have people had come from a range of,246
NA,Arabic speaking countries. There are Iraqis and there are a lot of Afghanis who are trying to,246
NA,find their way in Shepparton.,246
NA,"On a very serious note, Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley have done an awful lot of",246
NA,heavy lifting in relation to resettling refugees. Governments need to be very careful when they,246
NA,think that they can just plonk people in certain areas because there seem to be a lot of other,246
NA,"immigrants and refugees in those areas, it all looks good and we will talk about it in such a",246
NA,"positive light. To a large degree it is positive, but what we need to be very careful of is the",246
NA,issue called secondary migration. When we bring refugees into Australia we put a cohort of,246
NA,"support structures around them, with language skills, housing support and employment",246
NA,"support-there is a whole range-but, when those refugees migrate out of the eastern suburbs",246
NA,"of Melbourne and decide they want to make Shepparton their home, the secondary migration",246
NA,takes place without the associated supports. That is where Shepparton is at the moment. We,246
NA,have had so much secondary migration. People have moved to the regions because it is,246
NA,"cheaper to live there and there is a bigger cohort of refugees of like race, so they feel they can",246
NA,move into those areas and be amongst their own. But we need to be very cognisant of the,246
NA,continued need to put supports around these people. I would like to push the fact that,246
NA,language is a very serious barrier for enabling people to further assimilate into whatever,246
NA,"community they want, but it is an incredibly important part of us being able to welcome these",246
NA,"people. These people will not come into our community groups, our community clubs and our",246
NA,community organisations if they do not have the confidence generated by being able to speak,246
NA,the language.,246
NA,"When talking about being a great country in relation to this, whilst I am incredibly proud of",246
NA,"the government's achievements with our borders, we need to be mindful of the damage that is",246
NA,done to individuals after prolonged periods in refugee camps overseas and in offshore,246
NA,"detection. When we bring these people in and we are able to resettle them here, there are still",246
NA,"significant issues and support that they need because of the separation from their family, the",246
NA,uncertainty about bridging visas and the uncertainty around temporary protection visas.,246
NA,"Whilst I am incredibly proud of our record and what we have achieved, I am also incredibly",246
NA,"aware that there is a real cost to dealing with this problem, and that simply means that we",246
NA,have to be very honest about all the associated issues when it comes to refugees being,246
NA,resettled here.,246
NA,The Goulburn Valley is an amazingly multicultural environment. It is a beautiful place for,246
NA,food. We have beautiful people from beautiful parts of the world making this beautiful food.,246
NA,It is a real awakening when people come to Shepparton. They would not realise that we have,246
NA,NA,246
NA,all these amazing cultures and amazing opportunities for greater understanding. We have a lot,247
NA,of work to do and we need a lot of support. I am looking forward to the migration committee's,247
NA,work under Jason Wood. We are conducting an inquiry into resettlement. I want to reaffirm,247
NA,the Prime Minister's motion to the House.,247
Ms BANKS ,Chisholm) (17:23): I am absolutely delighted to support this motion by the,247
NA,"Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, today. This motion goes to the very essence of what I",247
NA,"stand for. I am so proud to be here supporting this motion as the member for Chisholm,",247
NA,Australia's third most culturally diverse electorate. Australia is the world's most successful,247
NA,multicultural nation on this earth. This is reflected in our celebration and warm embrace of,247
NA,different cultures in community and business life. The contribution of migrants to Australian,247
NA,"society, including many in the electorate of Chisholm, is significant to the prosperity and",247
NA,"harmonious way in which we celebrate our culture. In any one day in Chisholm-as I said,",247
NA,the third most culturally diverse electorate in Australia-many languages other than English,247
NA,"are spoken and many cultural events and traditions are enjoyed, and this all happens in",247
NA,harmony.,247
NA,The embrace of multiculturalism and equal opportunity is intuitive and formidable under,247
NA,the Turnbull government. Our commitment is to a completely non-discriminatory policy and,247
NA,"the rights of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect, regardless",247
NA,"of race, colour, creed or origin, as is our commitment to the process of reconciliation with",247
NA,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Australia's migration program does not,247
NA,discriminate on the basis of ethnicity or religion.,247
NA,"In recent years the major source countries in our program have been India, China and the",247
NA,"United Kingdom. Australia is an immigration nation and we should all be very proud and,",247
NA,"indeed, as in the words of our national anthem, we should 'all rejoice'. Today, almost half of",247
NA,us have a parent born overseas and more than a quarter of Australians were born overseas,247
NA,themselves. We are much more diverse than the United States.,247
NA,Since 1949 more than 7½ million people have come from all corners of the earth to make,247
NA,"Australia their home. Migrants from all over the world, including our newest Australians,",247
NA,"have arrived under a broad range of visas-as skilled migrants nominated by employers, as",247
NA,"refugees, as humanitarian entrants, as partners, as carers, as business owners, as regional",247
NA,"skilled migrants, as people of distinguished talent, as parents, as children and as students.",247
NA,Each one brings a rich personal history that we have welcomed into our community. At the,247
NA,"time that they formalise their commitment to our country, our values and our rule of law, they",247
NA,start their journey in Australia.,247
NA,This year marks the 50th anniversary of when Australia became an early signatory to the,247
NA,United Nations International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial,247
NA,Discrimination. It is a treaty that goes directly to a basic principle of respect for each other as,247
NA,"fellow human beings and respect for each other regardless of race, colour or ethnicity.",247
NA,It is always important to reflect on history and see how far we have come as a nation. In,247
NA,1966 that treaty was signed by the Liberal Prime Minister Harold Holt. Only months earlier,247
NA,"the Holt government made significant changes to our migration laws, dismantling all laws",247
NA,allowing discrimination against migrants on the grounds of colour or race.,247
NA,NA,247
NA,In May 1967 Australians overwhelmingly voted to amend the Constitution to enable the,248
NA,Commonwealth to make laws for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians-a,248
NA,process that was begun under the Sir Robert Menzies government and was completed under,248
NA,the leadership of Harold Holt. These decisions under the Menzies and Holt governments,248
NA,removed the White Australia policy and embraced all the new and exciting opportunities for,248
NA,"our country, which were underpinned by the people who came from far and wide. They",248
NA,"sought to end discrimination, celebrating and reaffirming the Australian values of mutual",248
NA,"respect regardless of ethnicity, race, colour or creed.",248
NA,Central to our democracy is the rule of law. The rule of law is empowering and,248
NA,"constraining as it applies to every citizen and protects every citizen regardless of race, colour,",248
NA,"gender or status. But harmony and security are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, they are",248
NA,"intrinsically linked. To this, I discuss Labor's border failures, which are, in my view, Labor's",248
NA,greatest shame. Under Labor the criminal people-smuggling syndicates flourished. Eight,248
NA,"hundred boats arrived, 50,000 people arrived and 2,000 children were in detention, and the",248
NA,"greatest shame of all is that 1,200 people died.",248
NA,"Under the Turnbull government we have not had one boat arrival, no deaths at sea, we",248
NA,closed the detention centres and there are no children in detention. The Turnbull government's,248
NA,work in relation to border protection and securing our shores is lauded and praised around the,248
NA,"world. Moreover, the fact that we have our borders under control is what has created our",248
NA,dividend to bring in refugees-those most vulnerable from Syria and other parts of the world.,248
NA,"A total of just under 19,000 refugees have come to Australia recently as a result of our",248
NA,"measured, controlled approach.",248
NA,Our proud migrant story has many chapters and is told in the waves of people who have,248
NA,"come to our shores, and many of their stories are about their immigrant experience, stories",248
NA,and heritage. Last week I had the honour and privilege of presenting Australian citizenship,248
NA,certificates to many new citizens who have made Australia their home and who live in my,248
NA,electorate of Chisholm. In their pledge of citizenship they promise loyalty to Australia and its,248
NA,"people whose democratic beliefs they share, whose rights and liberties they respect and whose",248
NA,laws they will uphold and obey. It gave me so much pride and heartfelt warmth to have this,248
NA,"honour of officially welcoming people and congratulating them in joining our great nation,",248
NA,and to share this moment with them. The looks on many of their faces and the pure joy that,248
NA,"was in that room as I handed their certificates was joyful. My parents and ancestors, like",248
NA,"many-including the many in my electorate of Chisholm-have come, in the words of our",248
NA,"national anthem, 'across the seas' and 'toiled with hearts and hands'. New citizens have come",248
NA,"from the United Kingdom, China, India, Greece, Italy, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Hong Kong, New",248
NA,"Zealand, Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, Mauritius, the Philippines, and Malaysia. All those new",248
NA,"citizens who attended the ceremony, like all those before them, have so many stories to share.",248
NA,But the one thing we all have in common is that we are able as 'Australians all' to rejoice-,248
NA,because this is the most successful multicultural nation on this earth.,248
Mr LEESER ,"Berowra) (17:30): I rise in support of this motion today, and I thank the",248
NA,Prime Minister for introducing it. This motion outlines one of the most fundamental principles,248
NA,"of Australian society: that an individual should be judged according to their character, their",248
NA,"ideas, their actions and their deeds, and not their race, colour, creed or origin. It is a particular",248
NA,"honour to be the member for Berowra and to speak on this particular motion, because of my",248
NA,NA,248
NA,"illustrious predecessor, Phillip Ruddock, who served as member for Berowra for 23 years but",249
NA,served the Commonwealth parliament for 43 years; our second-longest serving member of the,249
NA,House of Representatives ever. It is particularly good to be speaking to this motion here,249
NA,"where my friend, the member for Bennelong who-like the member for Berowra-has been a",249
NA,great champion of multiculturalism in Australia.,249
NA,One of the things about my predecessor-and this motion gives me an opportunity to pay,249
NA,"some tribute to him-was his very strong connections with multicultural communities, along",249
NA,"with his very deep interest in the diversity of Australia, and the nation-building that he sought",249
NA,to do throughout his political career. Phillip Ruddock's interest in multiculturalism goes back,249
NA,to the time in the early 1980s when he was shadow minister for multiculturalism. He was,249
NA,"asked to produce a policy on multiculturalism, initially for the ACT, and became interested in",249
NA,getting to know some of the community leaders around the country. Phillip famously put his,249
NA,"political career in the firing line, as it were, when in 1988 he crossed the floor to support",249
NA,"Australia having a race-blind migration policy. I think, of the many important things he did in",249
NA,"his career, this was actually the most important. This is a principle which is reflected in the",249
NA,"motion today, but I think it is actually a fundamental principle of who we are as Australians.",249
NA,"It was very important to the making of Phillip Ruddock, in terms of his political career-not",249
NA,just as a very good local member and as someone who could forge a policy agenda but as,249
NA,somebody who stood for something that was very deep and very important. I really pay,249
NA,tribute to him for that.,249
NA,"Philip was also our longest-serving minister for immigration, and he enjoyed that portfolio;",249
NA,"he was also minister for Indigenous affairs, and that portfolio is also encompassed by some",249
NA,aspects of this motion. Phillip saw his role in the immigration portfolio as building the nation.,249
NA,"Some people see the immigration portfolio as merely a border protection portfolio, but that",249
NA,was not how Phillip saw it. He saw it as both choosing the next generation of people to be,249
NA,"Australians, and welcoming them, ensuring that they had good settlement services and",249
NA,ensuring that they became and felt part of the broader community. Having observed Phillip,249
NA,"closely, I think that being immigration minister was something that left its mark on him. But it",249
NA,"was also, undoubtedly, one of the most difficult policy areas imaginable. It was difficult",249
NA,because he had to make some tough decisions about Australia. He had to make some tough,249
NA,decisions about border protection when large numbers of boats came-and I think every,249
NA,"immigration minister faces those difficult decisions. While I am paying tribute to Phillip, I",249
NA,"also want to pay particular tribute to the present immigration minister, Peter Dutton, who has",249
NA,"done a fantastic job-as his predecessor, Scott Morrison, did-in ensuring that we have",249
NA,public confidence in the migration program by ensuring that people continue to come to,249
NA,Australia in an orderly manner; that we do not have the deaths at sea; that we do not have,249
NA,"50,000 people turning up on our doorstep; and that we do not have the large number of people",249
NA,in detention that existed under the previous government. The success of multiculturalism in,249
NA,Australia today is really founded on the issue of public confidence. That was something that,249
NA,both Phillip Ruddock and Peter Dutton have stressed in their contributions to the public,249
NA,"debate on this issue. Diversity is the goal. Diversity is fundamental to who we are, but you",249
NA,cannot have public support for diversity unless you have public confidence that we have an,249
NA,orderly system to bring people in.,249
NA,NA,249
NA,"For me, the right to equality and the idea of a race-blind immigration policy is absolutely",250
NA,axiomatic. I am very proud to have been the first Jewish Australian chosen by my party from,250
NA,New South Wales to serve in the House of Representatives. It is an interesting fact that in the,250
NA,first Commonwealth parliament the people of Indi in northern Victoria chose Isaac Alfred,250
NA,"Isaacs, one of the framers of the Constitution and later Chief Justice and Governor-General,",250
NA,"the people of South Australia chose Vaiben Louis Solomon and the people of Fremantle, just",250
NA,"out of Perth, chose Elias Solomon. Both Solomons were free traders, and Isaacs was a",250
NA,"protectionist. Those two streams formed the modern Liberal Party, but it was another 115",250
NA,"years before my party, or its antecedents, in my state chose somebody of my faith.",250
NA,"Prior to becoming a member of this parliament, I served on the representative body for the",250
NA,Jewish community in New South Wales. I had a particular role as chair of the community,250
NA,relations committee of that body. The NSW Jewish Board of Deputies' community relations,250
NA,"committee is absolutely fundamental, because its role is to build harmony and build",250
NA,relationships with other religious communities and other ethnic communities across the state.,250
NA,That is a very important thing in terms of a harmonious multicultural society-not just that,250
NA,"you have tolerance and diversity, but that you have people making an effort to share their",250
NA,differences and to celebrate the similarities of what makes us Australian. That was a great,250
NA,"privilege for me, because it gave me an opportunity, just as some of my previous work with",250
NA,"Philip Ruddock had done, to interact with some of the great community leaders involved in",250
NA,"the multicultural space. I particularly think of people like Stepan Kerkyasharian who is, if you",250
NA,"like, the godfather of multiculturalism in New South Wales. He served on the Anti-",250
NA,"Discrimination Board of NSW for many years, he served on what is now the Community",250
NA,"Relations Commission as its president for many years, and he served on SBS multicultural",250
NA,radio to help create a sense of inclusion and a sense of multiculturalism across the broader,250
NA,community.,250
NA,"I do not just think of people like Stepan, I think of people like Sev Ozdowski, of people in",250
NA,"the Chinese community like Benjamin Chow and Tony Pang, of people in the Indian",250
NA,"community like Parveen Gupta and Pallavi Sinha, of Professor Agar and Sanjeev Bhakri from",250
NA,"the Hindu Council, and of some of the other amazing people I met along the way. I am very",250
NA,"lucky to represent a community that, like the member for Bennelong's electorate, has a great",250
NA,"deal of ethnic diversity in it. About 40 per cent of people in my electorate were born overseas,",250
NA,"which is consistent with the national population. There are significant Chinese, Indian,",250
NA,"Korean, Italian, Lebanese and Malaysian populations in my community. It is that difference",250
NA,and that diversity that brings strength.,250
NA,One of the things I find whenever I am speaking to people who have chosen to be,250
NA,"Australians, who have come from other countries to settle here, is that they have an enormous",250
NA,"pride in being Australian. Australians by choice are a great benefit to our country, because,",250
NA,"very often, they have left circumstances, regimes and situations that are not as good as they",250
NA,"find here. They are grateful and feel fortunate to be here, and they want to see our country",250
NA,"prosper, because, if our country prospers, they too shall prosper. That is a great strength of our",250
NA,system.,250
NA,One of the other aspects of this particular motion is the commitment to reconciliation with,250
NA,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. I thought I might begin by talking a little bit,250
NA,about that. I have been on a real journey in relation to the issue of recognition of Indigenous,250
NA,NA,250
NA,"people in Australia. I must say, at the beginning of my journey I was opposed to any",251
NA,"recognition of Indigenous people, not because I do not wish to see Indigenous people prosper",251
NA,"and succeed, but because I was deeply concerned about the implications of adding words to",251
NA,the Constitution that might have unforeseen consequences.,251
NA,Over the last three or four years I have had the privilege of working with a group of,251
NA,"Indigenous leaders, people like Noel Pearson, Megan Davis and Marcia Langton, to come up",251
NA,with a suite of proposals which I think will provide a good pathway to achieving,251
NA,reconciliation and recognition of Indigenous people. It involves an extra constitutional,251
NA,"declaration of recognition, designed by Australians and voted on by Australians. It involves",251
NA,amending and updating the words in the race power so they reflect and codify current practice,251
NA,and that they change those words for being a power for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander,251
NA,"affairs. It involves removing the spent provision in section 25 in the Constitution. Finally, it",251
NA,involves creating a body that can provide advice to parliament and advice to government on,251
NA,laws relating to Indigenous people.,251
NA,"As we know, whenever you make a law you make a better quality law when you have",251
NA,consulted the people who are most affected by it. That is why some sort of body that provides,251
NA,"a voice for Indigenous people, in the policymaking and law-making process, would be a great",251
NA,advantage. I commend the motion to the chamber.,251
NA,Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (17:40): I rise to reaffirm my commitment to the rights of all,251
NA,"Australians to enjoy equal rights and to be treated with equal respect, regardless of race,",251
NA,"creed, colour or origin. Equal rights and personal freedom are fundamental ideals of",251
NA,"Australian society, fought for by our soldiers in so many theatres of war across the globe.",251
NA,Despite a long proud history of tolerance and acceptance there is still-and always will be-,251
NA,more to do.,251
NA,While the bare-faced discrimination of the early days of Australian settlement has virtually,251
NA,"banished from our society, as we stand here today, there is still more work to be done. As the",251
NA,Prime Minister said in his speech:,251
NA,"Our achievement in creating a harmonious nation is not an accident. It has been carefully crafted, and it",251
NA,must be nurtured. And a necessary precondition for harmony is security.,251
NA,It is this security that binds our entire society and allows it to be so diverse. Security is easily,251
NA,identified in ways we interact with the rest of the globe.,251
NA,"We have a history, and I think a proud history, of supporting the rights of those who are in",251
NA,peril through military action. In the First World War as a new nation we saw European,251
NA,countries-and it would eventually have led to our own country-under threat by the,251
NA,"Germans. Our war started in New Guinea, where the Germans had a pretty strong base in",251
NA,Rabaul and other parts of New Guinea. Our first recorded deaths in World War I were in,251
NA,"Rabaul, when five Australian soldiers were killed. But they did achieve what they set out to",251
NA,do: take over the communications that controlled all of the Pacific Islands. We then went on,251
NA,"to Gallipoli, North Africa and those dreadful trench wars in France. But it was aggression that",251
NA,helped the Western world and the islands achieve their independence.,251
NA,"The Second World War was similar, with German aggression again, including the",251
NA,extermination of millions of people based on their race. That was sad but we responded to the,251
NA,NA,251
NA,call. Those people now have the freedom that they longed for back then. They have it to a,252
NA,degree now.,252
NA,Vietnam was our stance against the spread of communism and people being persecuted.,252
NA,Whether the Vietnam War was one we could have kept out of is up to the individual to make,252
NA,"their own mind about, and there are two schools of thought. We thought we were doing the",252
NA,right thing by going in and helping the Vietnamese retain their freedom. With the current,252
NA,"Middle Eastern wars, Australia has taken to assisting those whose rights and safety are under",252
NA,siege.,252
NA,Work continues to this day with the ADF against the scourge of IS. Australians can stand,252
NA,proud in the knowledge that their military tradition has fought for the rights of people when,252
NA,"called upon, time after time. That security is also identified in Operation Sovereign Borders.",252
NA,There are two ways to come into Australia as an immigrant or refugee: the legal way and the,252
NA,"illegal way. By keeping our borders secure, we take the market away from the criminal",252
NA,"human-traffickers, thus allowing a more generous inflow of safe, legitimate, security-checked",252
NA,refugees.,252
NA,"While the media likes to throw doubt at Australian society's acceptance of newcomers, I",252
NA,think the best indicator of our acceptance is just how keen migrant families are to become,252
NA,Australian citizens. All of us in this House attend regular citizenship ceremonies in our,252
NA,"different locations. Each month, if I am available, I attend citizenship ceremonies at",252
NA,Gladstone and in other parts of my electorate of Flynn-Emerald and so forth-and I am,252
NA,taken aback by the passion and love that the so-called new Australians have for our,252
NA,community. I think these ceremonies are one of the greatest events you can attend as a,252
NA,"politician. You see the expressions on their face change as the words 'You are now an Aussie,",252
NA,mate' are said. I think it is proof of how proud these people are to leave their countries of birth,252
NA,and come to a place called 'Australia'. They had never been here before. Maybe they had some,252
NA,"family members who have been here. In essence, they had not been on Australian soil. They",252
NA,are here for the first time and they embrace the nation of Australia.,252
NA,"For the majority of them, all they want to do is become good Aussies, work hard and",252
NA,achieve what they could not achieve in their place of birth. These people often do so in order,252
NA,"to escape terrible dangers, and they hope to make a new life in a safe and secure country. By",252
NA,"offering them security and safety, we are able to welcome those new Aussies and the new",252
NA,economic windfall that they bring with them. That is where Australia benefits. We need these,252
NA,"immigrants, on a regular basis. We are an ageing nation and we need these people to look",252
NA,after people like me when we go into retirement in the next few years. They will replace the,252
NA,baby boomers. They are an essential part of our immigration policy.,252
NA,This government is committed to equal rights and constitutional acknowledgement of,252
NA,"Indigenous Australians. Recognition is overdue, and it is not helped by distracting comments",252
NA,"from those opposite about a treaty. I think if we leave things as they are, everything will be",252
NA,"fine. Recognition is an important step, but it is improving the life outcomes for all Indigenous",252
NA,Australians that will make a measurable difference to them and to Australia. Through poor,252
NA,"health outcomes, Indigenous Australians have a lifespan that is, on average, 10 years shorter",252
NA,than for those in the non-Indigenous population. This is something that all governments must,252
NA,address.,252
NA,NA,252
NA,This comes back to safety and security. The Prime Minister was talking about every,253
NA,Australian. Every visitor needs security. By continuing the fight for security and safety this,253
NA,nation and its people will continue to see Australia as a welcoming and sought-after,253
NA,"destination. My family, the O'Dowds, came from Ireland in 1949, just before the so-called",253
NA,Great Famine-the potato famine. It was a famine-the potatoes were diseased-but the,253
NA,"English, who then ruled Ireland, sought to shut off all the fishing holes and lakes, exported the",253
NA,lamb and beef to England and let 5½ million Irish people die on the streets of Ireland. That is,253
NA,how my family came to Australia-to escape the famine of 1850.,253
NA,"In those days, it was the Catholics against the Protestants. As a young child, I can",253
NA,remember that the Catholics and the Protestants were separated in religious classes in the tiny,253
NA,little schools they used to go to. That is a fact. Trinity College had an interesting story in,253
NA,Dublin. Trinity College is still there. It is a very old school and it was only for the Protestants.,253
NA,"For hundreds of years, the Catholics fought to be able to attend Trinity College. When they",253
NA,"finally got self-government, in 1920, they were told: 'Okay, you can now go to Trinity",253
NA,"College.' The Irish response to that was, 'It's good to know that we can go there, but we don't",253
NA,want to go there now.',253
NA,An honourable member: To be sure!,253
NA,"Mr O'DOWD: To be sure! With that, I would like to endorse what we are here to talk",253
NA,"about, and that is freedom for all, regardless of race, creed, colour or origin. Thank you very",253
NA,much.,253
Mr LITTLEPROUD ,"Maranoa) (17:50): Today, I stand in this chamber as a proud",253
NA,member of a government that throughout our nation's history has supported and respected the,253
NA,"tolerance of others no matter what their race, religion or gender and it continues to do so",253
NA,today. I am also proud of the fact that this country is the most successful multicultural society,253
NA,in the world. This is something all Australians should be proud of. If you ask a person in the,253
NA,"street what they think defines our Australian culture I am sure the words, 'mateship' and",253
NA,'getting in and having a go' are likely to be the responses that you will get. In fact that,253
NA,"narrative rings true here with this motion today, where both the government and the",253
NA,"opposition agree, just like it was 20 years ago when our former Prime Minister, John Howard,",253
NA,"and the then opposition leader, Kim Beazley, spoke on this very motion.",253
NA,"It would be remiss of me not to say that this generous, respectful and multicultural",253
NA,Australia has been underpinned by giving our people peace of mind. When I refer to the,253
NA,giving Australians peace of mind I am referring to the efforts we take to ensure that Australia,253
NA,"remains a harmonious multicultural society, underpinned by the focus on our country's",253
NA,national security.,253
NA,I have to say that I am extremely proud to be part of a government focused on the security,253
NA,of our borders and diligently managing our immigration programs. It is our ability to control,253
NA,"our borders that enables us to live in a harmonious, well-balanced and multicultural society.",253
NA,"We are definitely one of the luckiest countries in the world, and as a member of a functional",253
NA,global society this government recognises the need to do our part. I believe that the people,253
NA,"who come to this country by visa, whether as a skilled immigrant, a refugee or as a",253
NA,humanitarian entrant; as partners or carers; as a business owner; as a regional skilled migrant;,253
NA,"or as parents, and who agree to respect our country's sovereignty and laws deserve our",253
NA,mateship and an opportunity to contribute. Entry to our country through our humanitarian,253
NA,NA,253
NA,program-a program that is global and non-discriminatory-provides hope for a better future,254
NA,for people and their families who are displaced by conflict.,254
NA,"This government has committed to settling 12,000 additional humanitarian refugees who",254
NA,have been displaced by enduring conflict in Syria and Iraq. This government will work to,254
NA,ensure that refugees who are welcomed to Australia through our humanitarian program pass,254
NA,imperative security checks and meet health and character criteria. This government will be,254
NA,providing the necessary services to our humanitarian entrants to help them to build a life here,254
NA,in Australia so that they too can become self-reliant and participate equally as members of our,254
NA,Australian society.,254
NA,"My electorate of Maranoa is classified as regional, rural and remote and I would like to talk",254
NA,with the tangible benefits of ensuring that migrants successfully integrate in our regional rural,254
NA,and remote areas. On the ABC's Australian Story two weeks ago we learned firsthand about,254
NA,the benefits of encouraging multicultural integration in the small community town of,254
NA,"Mingoola, just over the border in New South Wales-a town that my leader, Deputy Prime",254
NA,"Minister Barnaby Joyce, actually represents. This is a town which in many ways is similar to",254
NA,"the sum of the towns in my electorate of Maranoa, in the sense that these communities are",254
NA,facing the challenges of a declining population and sustaining their essential services and,254
NA,"facilities. Smaller rural communities like Mingoola, and the many communities across",254
NA,"Mingoola, while facing challenges are also proud, community-minded and respectful",254
NA,"communities, where people are friendly and helpful and care about the future of their town.",254
NA,Julia Harpham noticed the pressure placed on the future of Mingoola. It was a problem,254
NA,which almost resulted in the closure of the local Mingoola school. Instead of accepting a sad,254
NA,"end, Julia worked to find a solution that would suit her community. In Julia Harpham's words:",254
NA,You don't like to see a community die. And there's not much joy in a place with no children.,254
NA,"Together the community of Mingoola worked with refugee advocates to facilitate, with the",254
NA,"help of this government, to bring refugee families from Central Africa to Mingoola.",254
NA,"Families arriving here as refugees from countries in Central Africa, like Rwanda, often do",254
NA,"not want the hustle and bustle of the city. They want a life on the land, to live in smaller",254
NA,communities to which they can contribute and for their children to enjoy a country,254
NA,"upbringing. Earlier this year three families relocated to Mingoola, increasing the small rural",254
NA,town's population by 29 and saving the local school from closure. The relocation of these,254
NA,three families has also provided employment opportunities for people with local farmers and,254
NA,alleviated the pressure placed on farmers in the area in attracting a reliable workforce.,254
NA,By all reports this project is a success for Mingoola and is an example of how Australia's,254
NA,"humanitarian program produces good outcomes, particularly in regional, rural and remote",254
NA,Australia. This outcome is exactly what the evidence tells us. When we integrate our,254
NA,immigrant population into our rural towns we broadened and revitalise our communities. We,254
NA,have people to utilise our schools and people to take job opportunities that we in rural,254
NA,Australia often find hard to place. Maintaining sustainable populations in our smaller,254
NA,communities means that all levels of government are able to ensure adequate investment in,254
NA,"planning, infrastructure, programs and services in the country. In my first speech I spoke",254
NA,about infrastructure being important for unlocking our economic prosperity in Maranoa.,254
NA,NA,254
NA,In the three months I have been in this role I have been fortunate to attend two citizenship,255
NA,"ceremonies: one in Dalby, at which the community welcomed 21 new citizens, and another at",255
NA,"Kingaroy, where 23 citizens joined the South Burnett community. In fact, the citizenship",255
NA,ceremony in Kingaroy was one of the largest held by the South Burnett Regional Council. I,255
NA,"watched proudly as our new citizens pledged loyalty to Australia, our people, our democratic",255
NA,beliefs and our rights and liberties and promised to respect and obey our laws. After speaking,255
NA,"to some of Maranoa's newest citizens and learning about them, their children and their",255
NA,background I was able to fully appreciate the value of their contribution to the social fabric,255
NA,and the economies of their new regional and rural communities.,255
NA,Another issue which I have been focusing on in my electorate is the value of our,255
NA,"passionate, dedicated and community minded volunteers in helping address community",255
NA,"disadvantage, whether that be by reason of unemployment, disability or otherwise. I have",255
NA,been encouraging people to recognise good citizens-the people who donate their time to,255
NA,help others. In preparing my speech on this very important motion I was surprised to learn,255
NA,"that, according to Volunteering Australia statistics from 2010, 36.2 per cent of people aged 18",255
NA,"years and over participated in formal volunteering, so roughly about 6.1 million people or 27",255
NA,per cent of the then 2010 population. Of that amount 1.44 million volunteers were people who,255
NA,"were born overseas, and 840,000 of those were people who spoke a language other than",255
NA,English. I think these statistics truly reflect the fact that the opportunity we provide to people,255
NA,through our immigration programs is of benefit to Australia.,255
NA,I would also like to acknowledge our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who contribute,255
NA,so much towards this country. I am grateful for our First Australians who are now saving lives,255
NA,"as doctors, nurses and paramedics, teaching children, working with our unique Australian",255
NA,environment and serving the Australian people here in this place. But I am also cognisant that,255
NA,we must continue our work in bettering the lives and opportunities of our First Australians.,255
NA,Our government is extremely committed to preserving our First Australians' history. While,255
NA,"the Prime Minister was in Birdsville with me last month we met with Jean Barr-Crombie, who",255
NA,through Red Ridge received a grant to publish a book on the Indigenous language unique to,255
NA,outback Birdsville. This grant will ensure that our Indigenous languages survive the years to,255
NA,come and remain an important part of Australia's history.,255
NA,"In closing, what we as a nation have achieved in creating the most functional and",255
NA,harmonious nation on earth is a great achievement but we can never take this for granted and,255
NA,we should be prepared to defend and preserve that achievement at all costs.,255

Mr MACKAY ,Durin g the debate,14
NA,last night I made some remarks on the,14
NA,difficulty which some fruit canners who,14
NA,are in a small way of business have in ob-,14
NA,taining a rebate on sugar supplied to,14
NA,them. I should like to know from the,14
NA,Minister for Trade and Customs what is,14
NA,the responsibility of the Colonial Sugar,14
NA,Refining Company and the Sugar Board,14
NA,in this connexion. Has the Government,14
NA,any power to interfere in the matter?,14
NA,NA,14
NA,sibility of the Sugar Board is to see that,14
NA,the agreement between the Common-,14
NA,wealth Government and the Government,14
NA,of Queensland is carried out. Beyond,14
NA,"this, the Commonwealth does not inter-",14
NA,fere. I noted the honorable member's,14

NA,Royal Commission on tho Finances of Western,15
NA,"Australia as affected by-Federation, which in-",15
NA,dicated that the annual loss on the North-west,15

NA,evidence by the Assistant Under-Treasurer of,15
NA,Western Australia that the loss was not so,15
NA,great as was originally thought; also that,15
NA,ordinary expenditure would only be slightly,15
NA,in excess of revenue other than land rents.,15

NA,1. Is i t a fact that tenders for the supply,15
NA,of Pacific Island steamship services closed on,15

NA,2. Is i t a fact that f u l l information in regard,15
NA,"to this tender was published in the press, al-",15
NA,though the Government did not see fit to,15
NA,accept it?,15
NA,3. Is i t a fact that further tenders were,15
NA,"invited, closing on 30th November, 1925, and",15
NA,that no finality has yet been reached i n the,15
NA,matter ?,15
NA,"4. Is i t a fact that Burns, Philp, and Com-",15

NA,"month to month, whilst the Government is",15
NA,endeavouring to encourage ships manned .by,15
NA,black labour and foreign labour to enter this,15
NA,trade ?,15
NA,5. W i l l the Government definitely state what,15
NA,is proposed i n this matter?,15
Mr MARR ,Th e answers to the,15
NA,honorable member's questions are as,15
NA,1. Yes.,15
NA,2. Certain information in regard to the,15
NA,"tender appeared i n the Sydney press, but the",15
NA,Government is unaware of the' circumstances,15
NA,under which i t was published.,15
NA,3. Yea.,16
NA,"4. The contract expired on 31st July, 1925,",16
NA,but was extended for six months in the first,16
NA,"place, and later for a further period of six",16
NA,"montlis from 1st February, 1926, with the",16
NA,object of enabling the fullest investigation to,16
NA,be made by thc Government into all aspects,16
NA,of the service in question before finalizing its,16
NA,plans for the future.,16
NA,5. The Government expects to be in a posi-,16
NA,tion to make an announcement in regard to this,16
NA,matter at an early date.,16
NA,LOSS OF S.S. DORRIGO.,16
Mr FORDE , the Minister for,16
NA,"Trade and Customs, upon notice-",16
NA,1. Has his attention been drawn to an article,16
NA,appearing in the Eockhampton Morning Bul-,16
NA,"letin of the 5th instant, entitled "" The Dorrigo",16
NA,"Disaster and its Lessons "" ?",16
NA,2. In view of the points raised in the article,16
NA,"mentioned, will he obtain, from competent naval",16
NA,"architects, data with respect to the lost vessel",16
NA,showing-,16
NA,(a) the height of the centre of gravity,16
NA,above the ship's bottom; and,16
NA,(6) the position of the metacentre rela-,16
NA,tively to the centre of gravity-,16
NA,at thc time of the Dorrigo leaving Brisbane,16
NA,on the voyage on which she was lost?,16
NA,"3. On the data supplied as in 2, will he",16
NA,obtain from a competent naval architect an,16
NA,opinion regarding the seaworthiness of the,16
NA,Dorrigo at the time of her departure as above?,16
NA,4. Will he ascertain whether proper scientific,16
NA,data regarding the stability of the Dorrigo,16
NA,was given by her former owners to her new,16
NA,"owners when she changed hands in June, 1925?",16
NA,"5. If the answer to 4 is in the negative, will",16
NA,he cause such steps to be taken as will ensure,16
NA,the supply of such information or data to,16
NA,new owners being part of the formal business,16
NA,of transferring ships from one owner to,16
NA,another?,16
NA,NA,16
NA,honorable member's questions are as,16
NA,follow:-,16
NA,1. I have seen the article referred to.,16
NA,2 and 3. A properly constituted Court of,16
NA,"Marine Inquiry, assisted by two experienced",16
NA,"shipmasters as nautical assessors, exhaustively",16
NA,investigated the circumstances attending the,16
NA,loss of the Dorrigo. One of the principal mat-,16
NA,ters investigated by the court was the disposi-,16
NA,"tion of. the cargo in the vessel's holds, but as",16
NA,the officers who had charge of the stowage in,16
NA,"Brisbane were both lost with the ship, the",16
NA,information obtained by the court on the dis-,16
NA,tribution of weights in the vessel was pre-,16
NA,sumably not sufficiently definite to enable any,16
NA,useful question as to the vessel's stability,16
NA,"being put to a naval architect. The court, it",16
NA,"may be mentioned, had full power to require",16
NA,the attendance of any naval architect as a.,16
NA,witness.,16
NA,4. The evidence given at the inquiry showed,16
NA,that the new owners did not receive from the,16
NA,vendors any precise particulars regarding the,16
NA,stability of the vessel.,16
NA,5. The whole procedure in connexion with,16
NA,the sale and transfer of ships is governed en-,16
NA,tirely throughout the Empire by the Merchant,16
NA,Shipping Act of Great Britain. Under this,16
NA,"act, there is no power to require the supply by",16
NA,vendors of data regarding the stability of a,16
NA,vessel.,16

Mr THOMPSON ,,16
NA,SON-,16
NA,"That, in the opinion of tbis House, a re-",16

Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [2.43] -,16
NA,When the debate on this motion was ad-,16
NA,"journed, the honorable member fo r Rich-",16
NA,"mond ( Mr R. Green) was speaking,",16
NA,and obtained leave to continue his,16
NA,remarks at a later date. I t is sug-,16
NA,gested to me now by the Treasurer,16
NA,that I should move the further adjourn-,16
NA,ment of the debate i n order to permit,16
NA,the honorable member who is absent to-,16
NA,day to resume his remarks three weeks,16
NA,hence - I would readily agree to that sug-,16
NA,"gestion but f o r the fact that, on the last",16
NA,"occasion, the honorable member spoke for",16
NA,"about forty-five minutes, and u n t i l the",16
NA,time available f o r the discussion of private,16
NA,members' business had expired. I t was,16
NA,known then to honorable members opposite,16
NA,"that I was anxious to say a few words,",16
NA,really by way of interrogation to the,16
NA,Treasurer. I was anxious to ascertain,16
NA,f r o m h i m why nothing had been done,16
NA,to put into effect the New States plank,16
NA,of the Country party's platform. B u t,16
NA,despite m y occasional interruptions to,17
NA,"tliat effect, the honorable member f o r",17
NA,"Richmond continued his speech, and",17
NA,despite my protest the debate was post-,17
NA,poned f o r a month. I was most anxious,17
NA,-to have a division on the motion. This,17
NA,is a matter which should be very near to,17
NA,"the heart of the Treasurer, and he should",17
NA,support the motion with all the eloquence,17
NA,at his command. When the right honor-,17
NA,able member for North Sydney ( Mr .,17
NA,"Hughes) was Prime Minister, the honor-",17
NA,able member for Cowper ( Dr Earle,17
NA,Page) occupied a position on tbe cross,17
NA,benches and frequently delivered eloquent,17
NA,"speeches, which were read with great plea-",17
NA,"sure by thc New States people outside,",17
NA,urging the Government to take a refer-,17
NA,endum on the question of amending the,17
NA,Constitution on the lines now suggested,17
NA,by the honorable member for New Eng-,17
NA,land ( Mr Thompson). M y chief,17
NA,pose i n speaking to-day is to prompt' the,17
NA,Treasurer to declare the policy of the Go-,17
NA,vernment on this matter. During the,17
NA,"last. Parliament, motions identical with",17
NA,that moved by the honorable member for,17
NA,New England were placed on the notice-,17
NA,paper .by men who had secured,17
NA,their election by tolling the people,17
NA,that they stood f o r the creation of,17
NA,"new States, and that everything would",17
NA,be well when those new States were,17
NA,brought into existence. Those who have,17
NA,been returned to Parliament by making,17
NA,"certain promise."", to the electors should",17
NA,""" deliver the goods,"" instead of merely",17
NA,placing motions on the business-paper and,17
NA,allowing them to be talked out. I am,17
NA,anxious that a division should be taken,17
NA,on the motion of the honorable member,17
NA,"for New England, and for that reason I",17
NA,cannot accept the suggestion that the,17
NA,debate should be postponed f o r another,17
NA,three weeks. D u r i n g tbe last federal,17
NA,election campaign the Treasurer made,17
NA,use of thc New States issue i n order,17
NA,to assist the Country party's candidates.,17
NA,"He visited Rockhampton, where I do not",17
NA,"think he played the game fairly, because",17
NA,he received a deputation' from the New,17
NA,"States League, and used the occasion to",17
NA,criticize me instead of confessing candidly,17
NA,that he had done nothing f o r their,17
NA,ment.,17
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Th e statement,17
NA,I had done nothing is absolutely inaccufact.,17
NA,rate.,17
NA,JHr. Forde.,17
Mr FORDE ,Th e Treasurer has done,17
NA,a great deal of talking about the making,17
NA,"of new States, but what else? Although",17
NA,"he has occupied the second position, i n",17
NA,"the present Cabinet f o r four years,",17
NA,during w hich period he was Acting Prime,17
NA,r,17
NA,"Minister f o r twelve months, he has done",17
NA,nothing to furthe r the New States,17
NA,movement i n a practical way. H e,17
NA,knows very well that new States cannot,17
NA,"be created by the State Parliaments, and",17
NA,that nothing definite can be done to bring,17
NA,"about their establishment, except by a.",17
NA,general remodelling of the Federal Con-,17
NA,"stitution, wliich necessitates action on the",17
NA,part of the Federal Parliament. H e has,17
NA,attended New States conventions and,17
NA,"made eloquent speeches, which placed .",17
NA,"some of the people i n the north, who",17
NA,suffer great disabilities under the present,17
NA,"arrangement of the State boundaries, on",17
NA,purthe tiptoe of expectation regarding the,17
NA,"creation of new States, and they ap-",17
NA,plauded h i m as the leader of the move-,17
NA,"ment. I n this way, he succeeded i n",17
NA,-,17
NA,winning the New England seat f o r,17
NA,the honorable member who now holds,17
NA,i t . . I do not think that honorable,17
NA,member w i l l deny i t . Mr Massy,17
NA,Greene originally lost the Richmond seat,17
NA,largely because i t was said that he was,17
NA,not a New .States enthusiast. A t that,17
NA,time the whole of northern New South,17
NA,Wales was organized to fight f o r the New,17
NA,"States movement, and over 300 delegates",17
NA,attended a conference at Armidale. The,17
NA,Treasurer spoke to them of what he would',17
NA,"do, and they applauded him. They ex-",17
NA,pected great things f r o m his advocacy of,17
NA,"the movement, but, so f a r , he has done",17
NA,"nothing practical. He has merely talked,",17
NA,and talk is cheap. D u r i n g the Eden-,17
NA,Monaro by-election campaign the honor-,17
NA,able gentleman made an eloquent speech,17
NA,"on the New States movement, a report of",17
NA,"which I read i n the press, and he urged",17
NA,the electors to vote f o r the Nationalist,17
NA,"candidate, because, as he put i t ,",17
NA,.the Government believed i n the,17
NA,establishment of new States. We,17
NA,have not yet heard one word of the,17
NA,Government's policy i n that regard. The,17
NA,Treasurer took me to task because I was,17
NA,move- not a member of the New States Parlia-,17
NA,"mentary Committee, but the honorable",17
NA,"gentleman himself is not a member of i t ,",17
NA,that and makes all sorts of excuses for that,17
Mr THOMPSON , I rise to a point of,18
NA,order. Tlie honorable member f,18
NA,cornia made a gross misstatement when,18
NA,he said that the Treasurer is not a memsurer done?,18
NA,ber of the New States League.,18
Mr SPEAKER , T h a t is not a point subscription.,18
NA,of order. A n y misstatements can be cor-,18
NA,rected subsequently by a personal exto the meetings.,18
NA,planation.,18
Mr FORDE , I said that the Treaber,18
NA,surer is not a member of the New States,18
NA,Parliamentary Committee.,18
Mr THOMPSON ,H e is.,18
Mr FORDE , I was told by the hon-,18
NA,"orable member, and by others, that the",18
NA,Treasurer is not a member of that com-,18
NA,"mittee, and the honorable",18
NA,excused his Leader on the ground that,18
NA,member of the Cabinet could not be a,18
NA,member of such a committee.,18
Mr THOMPSON ,That.i s not correct.,18
Mr FORDE , I f the Treasurer is a,18

NA,I had called attention to the fact that be,18

Mr THOMPSON ,Tha t is a deliberate,18

Mr BRENNAN , I rise to order. The,18

Mr SPEAKER , I d id not hear,18

Mr THOMPSON , I withdraw i t .,18
Mr FORDE , I would not tell a,18
NA,about any honorable member. I am,18
NA,prised and disappointed that the honoring.,18
NA,able member w i l l not admit what,18
NA,he knows he told me. Several honand,18
NA,orable members of this House excused,18
NA,the Treasurer f o r not joining the,18
NA,"States Parliamentary Committee, on",18
NA,"ground that, as a Minister, he could not",18
NA,join a committee that was urging upon surer said-,18
NA,the Government a certain policy. Appa-,18
NA,rently by calling attention to the Treathe,18

NA,I take exception to the Trea-,18

NA,apathy i n regard to the . sub-,18
NA,ject by blaming the Labour ' party.,18
NA,"New Speaking, as Acting Prime Minister at",18
NA,"tho a New States conference, i n Rockhamp-",18

NA,- That some radical change is necessary in,18
NA,present system of government in Austra-,18
NA,is the most wide and universally held belief,18
NA,in all quarters of Australia at the present,18
NA,time. I t is readily felt that federation has,18
NA,failed to accomplish much of the aim for which,19
NA,i t was consummated. I t has not created that,19
NA,intense national feeling. All parochial con-,19
NA,siderations disregard the existence of imagi-,19
NA,"nary State boundaries, and prevent the con-",19
NA,tinuation of that system of pitting one capital,19
NA,city against another which has proved so,19
NA,detrimental to the balanced and proportionate,19
NA,development of Australia as a whole.,19
NA,He repeated these platitudes in New Eng-,19
NA,"land, Eden-Monaro, and elsewhere.",19
NA,the Treasurer had any political,19
NA,he would be quiet on the hustings re-,19

NA,"has never, to my knowledge,",19

NA,in the position to do something,19
NA,He now reserves his talk for up country.,19
NA,"When, as Leader of the",19
NA,"party, he sat on the ministerial",19
NA,"bench, he took the right honorable mem-",19
NA,ber for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) to,19
NA,task for not having done anything,19
NA,help the creation of new States;,19
NA,"since he has been in office, he seems to",19
NA,have forgotten this matter. He tries to,19
NA,place the responsibility on the Labour,19
NA,"party and myself, and would have the",19
NA,people of Central Queensland,19
NA,that all would have been well if I had,19
NA,joined the New States Parliamentary,19
NA,Committee. The Labour party took the,19
NA,"only logical action it could take, by de-",19
NA,clining to enter into a secret,19
NA,with the National-Country party,19
NA,"tion, which already had the",19
NA,in the House to do what it thought,19
NA,It was the Government's duty to bring,19
NA,down proposals and give,19
NA,members an opportunity of considering,19
NA,"them. Senator Thompson, who comes",19
NA,"from Central Queensland, has taken an",19
NA,interest in the New States movement in,19
NA,"his own district, and has",19
NA,league meetings and has been to Armi-,19
NA,dale and other places. The Treasurer's,19
NA,remark that whatever I have had to,19
NA,say has been said in my own electorate,19
NA,"is incorrect, for I have spoken on this",19
NA,subject in Parliament every time,19
NA,have had an opportunity. One does hot,19
NA,help such a movement by attending,19
NA,meetings of members of the New States,19
NA,Parliamentary Committee and,19
NA,the time of day with the Treasurer,19
NA,his room at Parliament House.,19
NA,way honorable members are bottled up,19
NA,and are not free to criticize.,19
NA,Mr Forde.,19
NA,orable members who support the move-,19
NA,ment should express their views i n,19
NA,the House when an opportunity like tho,19
NA,"present offers-a n opportunity which, by",19
NA,"the way, the Treasurer sought to post-",19
NA,pone f o r three weeks. I am asking tho,19
NA,Government to give an account of its,19
NA,"actions i n this matter, and I am hoping",19
NA,. If to induce the Treasurer to declare what,19

NA,made a northern New South Wales who have,19
NA,"in this spent hundreds of pounds, and put",19
NA,"themselves to great inconvenience, to",19
NA,effective. organize New States conventions. On,19
NA,"consulting the Hansard reports, I find",19
NA,"Country that Senator Thompson, to whom tbe",19
NA,cross Treasurer has given credit for his,19
NA,"work i n this movement, said nothing i n",19
NA,the Senate on this subject during 1923,19
NA,"to and 1924. On the 28th August, 1925,",19
NA,"but however, he made the following brief",19
NA,"comment, which is reported on page",19
NA,1S33. of Hansard of that date: -,19
NA,As the question of a new States referendum,19
NA,believe is to be brought under the notice of the Prime,19
NA,"Minister ( Mr Bruce), I trust the matter will",19
NA,"be given sympathetic consideration, and that",19
NA,the machinery necessary for creating new,19
NA,States will be simplified. An appeal would,19
NA,have to be made to the people by way of,19
NA,"referendum, and that is all that is being asked",19
NA,conclave for at present.,19
NA,sec-,19
NA,numbers That is the only reference made by,19
NA,right. Senator Thompson to the subject during,19
NA,that year. W h a t was wanted was straight,19
NA,"honorable talk, and not platitudes. The Country",19
NA,"party, went before the electors i n 1922, i n",19
NA,opposition to the right honorable member,19
NA,for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) and the,19
NA,"National party, on a platform which con-",19
NA,attended tained the following planks :-,19
NA,FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OF NEW,19
NA,STATES TO SECURE PRACTICAL DECENTRALIZA-,19
NA,TION.,19
NA,(a) To advocate the early holding of a Fede-,19
NA,ral Convention to consider tlie revising of the,19
NA,"Constitution, such convention to be elected on",19
NA,"I the Federal rolls, and each State to be divided",19
NA,into five electorates returning three delegates,19
NA,the for each electorate by the system of propor-,19
NA,tional representation. To aim at securing new,19
NA,and definite apportionments of tlie powers and,19
NA,passing duties of the Federal and State authorities.,19
NA,in (B) In order to bring about economical and,19
NA,"In that efficient State government and administration,",19
NA,and to avoid costly duplication of State and,19
NA,"Federal activities, i t is necessary to subdivide",19
NA,Hon- the present unwieldy States into manageable,19
NA,areas with community of interests under their,20
NA,"own Constitution, thereby bringing about a",20
NA,"simpler form of State government, leaving all",20
NA,national functions to the Federal Parliament.,20
NA,On that platform! the honorable the,20
NA,Treasurer became very eloquent when,20
NA,"addressing the electors of . Cowper, and",20
NA,he was largely instrumental i n securing,20
NA,the election of the honorable member f o r,20
NA,"New England ( Mr Thompson), and the",20
NA,honorable member f o r Richmond ( Mr .,20
NA,"R. Green), the latter i n opposition to the",20
NA,"National candidate, Mr Massy Greene.",20
NA,"""When the composite Ministry",20
NA,"formed after the election, the Treasurer",20
NA,- was clothed with power to do some-,20
NA,"thing, but the next thing we heard of the",20
NA,New States movement was the following,20
NA,questions asked of the right honorable the,20
NA,Prime Minister by the honorable mem-,20
NA,"ber for New England, on the 4th July,",20
NA,1923:-,20
NA,1. Whether certain letters have been received,20
NA,from the Governments of New South Wales,20
NA,and Queensland inviting the Commonwealth,20
NA,Government to take action to bring about' the,20
NA,"amendment of the Constitution, in order to",20
NA,facilitate tlie creation of new States in New,20
NA,South Wales and Queensland?,20
NA,"2. I f so, what action, if any, has the Com-",20
NA,monwealth Government taken to comply with,20
NA,thc suggestions or proposals made by the,20
NA,States referred to?,20
NA,The Prime Minister's reply was:-,20
NA,The answers to the honorable member's,20
NA,questions are as follow:-,20
NA,1. Yes.,20
NA,2. In both cases the respective Governments,20
NA,-were informed of the action i t was necessary,20
NA,for them to take to comply with tlie require-,20
NA,ments of the Constitution.,20
NA,The Treasurer was placing the respon-,20
NA,"sibility on the States, and the States",20
NA,were throwing i t back on the Commonof,20
NA,wealth. That game of battledore and,20
NA,shuttlecock continued f o r a long time.,20
NA,The Treasurer went to northern New,20
NA,South Wales and advised the advocates,20
NA,of New States to keep their powder dry,20
NA,and all would be well soon. The people,20
NA,"are tired of that advice, and now want",20
NA,"action, which I am trying to induce",20
NA,Government to take. The letter received,20
NA,f r o m the Queensland Government,20
NA,the result of the following motion moved Nationalists.,20
NA,"by me, and carried almost unanimously,",20
NA,in the Queensland Parliament,20
NA,"6th July, 1922:-",20
NA,That in tho opinion of this Parliament,20
NA,time has arrived for the remodelling of,20
NA,Commonwealth Constitution providing for,20
NA,subdivision of Australia into a greater number,20
NA,"of self-governing States, making for more",20
NA,"economical and effective government, and also",20
NA,providing an easy method for the people,20
NA,"living in any district, such as central Queens-",20
NA,"land or northern New South Wales, to obtain",20
NA,self-government; and that tlie Prime Minister,20
NA,of Australia be urged to take the necessary,20
NA,steps to bring about these reforms.,20
NA,That resolution was subsequently pre-,20
NA,sented to the right honorable the Prime,20
NA,Minister. The chief opponent of i t was,20
NA,"Mr A . E . Moore, the leader of the",20
NA,"Country party, and now the Leader of",20
NA,"was the. Opposition, i n the Queensland Par-",20
NA,"liament, who said-",20
NA,"I am opposed to the proposal, because i t is",20
NA,only going to lead to expense. . . . I am,20
NA,"opposing both motion and amendment, because",20
NA,I do not think there has been any mandate,20
NA,"from the people outside, or any agitation, to",20
NA,"speak of, amongst them. . . . There may be",20
NA,a little private agitation in one or two small,20
NA,"centres in central and nortliern Queensland,",20
NA,but there has been no agitation which has -,20
NA,shaken Queensland as a whole. We know that,20
NA,conditions to-day are totally different from,20
NA,"what they were many years ago, when Separa-",20
NA,tion was a live question. We have the railway,20
NA,"to Rockhampton, and i t is almost completed,",20
NA,right up to the north. . . . There is no,20
NA,doubt that the proposal would not lead to,20
NA,economy. The Lands Department has a branch,20
NA,"in Rockhampton, the Railway Department is",20
NA,"practically decentralized, and Rockhampton",20
NA,"has its own Chief of Staff, who is only re-",20
NA,sponsible to the Commissioner. He has tlie,20
NA,running of the railways generally in that area;,20
NA,and the same remark applies to the north. I,20
NA,do not tliink the reason exists to-day that,20
NA,"existed twenty years ago, when this was a live",20
NA,question. . . . I claim the right to say,20
NA,that I object to Separation . . . . i t will not,20
NA,"be for tlie benefit of the State, and I intend to",20
NA,oppose both tlie amendment and the motion.,20
NA,I mention these facts because members,20
NA,the Country party state that theirs is,20
NA,the only party that advocates the re-,20
NA,modelling of the Constitution i n order to,20
NA,provide facilities for the creation of new,20
NA,States. A certain amount of blame has,20
NA,been attached to the Labour party i n my,20
NA,"electorate for its alleged inactivity, but",20
NA,the Government has. a m a j o r i ty i n this,20
NA,"the Parliament, and its duty is to act. The",20
NA,greatest opposition to the New States,20
NA,was movement has come f r o m prominent,20
NA,"Mr W. H . Barnes, a",20
NA,"leading Nationalist i n Queensland, said,",20
NA,"on the on the 30th July, 1922-",20
NA,"In my judgment, i t would be a huge mistake",20
NA,the to cut up Queensland into smaller States. I,20
NA,the think i t would be an unwise thing for this,20
NA,the House to agree to a motion of this kind.,20
NA,"Notwithstanding the opposition, my",21
NA,motion was passed with the,21
NA,"port of the Labour members, be-",21
NA,cause i t was i n accordance with the,21
NA,platform of the Labour party.,21
Mr THOMPSON ,Whic h nevertheless did,21
NA,nothing.,21
Mr FORDE , I give the honorable,21
NA,member for New England ( Mr Thomp-,21
NA,son) credit for having taken a live i n -,21
NA,terest i n this question. I believe he has,21
NA,tried to push the Government into doing,21
NA,something. The blame f o r inaction,21
NA,"should be placed upon the shoulders, of",21
NA,"the Government, not the Labour party.",21
NA,"On the 24th July, 1924, the honorable",21
NA,member moved the following motion i n,21
NA,this House: -,21
NA,"Tliat, in the opinion, of this House, the",21
NA,"Government should, at the earliest oppor-",21
NA,"tunity, introduce a bill providing for a re-",21
NA,ferendum of the electors of Australia at the,21
NA,next general elections upon a proposal to,21
NA,amend chapter VI . (New States) of the,21
NA,"Commonwealth Constitution, so as to empower",21
NA,the Federal Parliament to create new States,21
NA,"within the existing States, with or without",21
NA,the consent of the State Parliaments; such,21
NA,power only to be used on the petition of a,21
NA,"fixed number of electors in any area, and only",21
NA,after the State Parliament has failed to take,21
NA,action.,21
NA,"Nothing came of i t , f o r although the",21
NA,Government had 46 members i n the,21
NA,"House against 29 Labour members, i t",21
NA,"side-tracked the motion, as i t does all",21
NA,private members' business. The motion,21
NA,was so much window-dressing designed to,21
NA,keep alive the enthusiasm of the New,21
NA,"Staters, to make them believe that some-",21
NA,thing would be done. I t was also intended,21
NA,to permit the Treasurer still to pose as,21
NA,"the leader of a great movement, which",21
NA,he had thrown over after climbing into,21
NA,power on i t .,21
Mr HUGHES , I t was what the AmeriT,21
NA,cans call eye-wash.,21
Mr FORDE ," I n July, 1923, the",21
NA,honorable member for New England i n -,21
NA,troduced to the Prime Minister ( Mr .,21
NA,Bruce) a deputation which pressed f o r,21
NA,some definite action i n regard to the set-,21
NA,ting up of new States. I n reply to the,21
NA,request the Prime Minister said-,21
NA,I give you an assurance that the Govern-,21
NA,ment realizes that i t has to investigate the,21
NA,matter very closely indeed with a view to,21
NA,coming to some determination as to whether,21
NA,action is to be taken. The time when we will,21
NA,have to come to the point of giving expres-,21
NA,sion of our opinions will be next year.,21
NA,.That would have been i n 1924. The,21
NA,supPrime Minister went on-,21
NA,It will almost certainly be next year when,21
NA,the question of constitutional alterations will,21
NA,be considered' by the Federal Parliament if .,21
NA,-the present Government is still in oflice. When,21
NA,"that time comes, your suggestions will receive",21
NA,the very fullest consideration.,21
NA,That also was what the right honorable,21
NA,member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes),21
NA,"has aptly termed eye-wash, f o r nothing",21
NA,has been done to give effect fo i t . Those,21
NA,interested i n the Ney States movement,21
NA,kept up their propaganda i n the expec-,21
NA,tation that the Government would,21
NA,"honour its undertaking, and various mem- -",21
NA,bers of the organization attended meet-,21
NA,"ings night after night i n support, of the",21
NA,movement. I give the honorable mem-,21
NA,ber for New England ( Mr Thompson),21
NA,credit f o r his activities i n that direc-,21
NA,tion; but I object to h i m excusing the,21
NA,Treasurer for his inactivity. H e should,21
NA,condemn both the Treasurer and the Go-,21
NA,"vernment i n strong terms, . and tell us",21
NA,what has happened behind the scenes to,21
NA,prevent the fulfilment of their platform,21
NA,promises. I n speaking i n this chamber,21
NA,"on the 24th July, 1924, the honorable",21
NA,"member, i n referring to the statement of",21
NA,the Prime Minister which I have just,21
NA,"quoted, said-",21
NA,The Government has not taken any steps to,21
NA,translate that fairly definite promise into,21
NA,action.,21
NA,The honorable member then proceeded to,21
NA,excuse the Government on the ground,21
NA,"that i t had been very busy, and he asked",21
NA,the House to give i t a lead. I contend,21
NA,"that the Treasurer, who came here as the",21
NA,"champion of the New Staters, should give",21
NA,the House a lead. I t should not be,21
NA,necessary f o r us to prod h i m into action.,21
NA,challenge h i m to give an account of his,21
NA,"stewardship, and to state i n plain terms",21
NA,his policy i n this matter. The Labour,21
NA,"party has a definite New States policy,",21
NA,"which, when i t is returned to power, i t",21
NA,w i l l put into effect. I t s platform i n,21
NA,regard to constitutional amendments,21
NA,reads:-,21
NA,1. Complete Australian self-government as a,21
NA,British community. No Imperial federation.,21
NA,Administration on advice of Australian Minis-,21
NA,"ters only, subject to the control of the Com-",21
NA,monwealth Parliament. All legislation except,21
NA,such as appears inconsistent with Imperial,21
NA,treaty obligations to be assented to on the ad-,21
NA,vice of Australian Ministers only. No further,21
NA,"Imperial, honours to be granted in any circum-",22
NA,stances to Australian citizens. The Common-,22
NA,weaUh Constitution to be amended to provide-,22
NA,(a) Unlimited legislative powers for the,22
NA,"Commonwealth Parliament, and such",22
NA,delegated powers to the States or,22
NA,provinces as the Commonwealth Par-,22
NA,liament may determine from time to,22
NA,time.,22
NA,(b) The Commonwealth Parliament to be,22
NA,vested with authority to create new,22
NA,States or provinces.,22
NA,I t has been said that the Labour party,22
NA,"stands f o r unification, that is, one go-",22
NA,vernment f o r Australia. I disagree w i t h,22
NA,that interpretation of our platform. What-,22
NA,this party stands for is the clothing of,22
NA,"this Parliament w i th unlimited powers,",22
NA,and the devolution of adequate governing,22
NA,"powers to subordinate legislatures, i n",22
NA,such provincial areas as Northern New,22
NA,"South Wales, Central Queensland,-North-",22
NA,"ern Queensland, and others where local",22
NA,developmental work could be advantage-,22
NA,ously undertaken.,22
Mr THOMPSON ,Som e members of,22
NA,Labour party declare that its platform,22
NA,provides f o r unification.,22
Mr FORDE ,N o person is correct,22
NA,i n saying such a thing. That is not the,22
NA,way I read i t . I t provides that this Parlia-,22
NA,"ment shall have sovereign power, and that",22
NA,"provincial parliaments with adequate,",22
NA,authority shall be set up i n those parts,22
NA,of the Commonwealth where the popula-,22
NA,tion and resources are sufficient f o r local,22
NA,government to be effective. Those pro-,22
NA,vincial authorities could be granted,22
NA,powers necessary from time,22
NA,time by the National Parliament.,22
NA,"No doubt, certain objections",22
NA,this proposal will be taken by some sup -,22
NA,porters of the New States movement.,22
NA,The motion submitted by the honorable,22
NA,member for New England proposes that,22
NA,this Parliament shall have power to divide,22
NA,the Commonwealth into new States on,22
NA,such terms and conditions as i t thinks,22
NA,fit. Our platform makes similar provi-,22
NA,sion. What the Labour party proposes is,22
NA,that the Commonwealth Parliament shall,22
NA,"be the sovereign authority, and that the",22
NA,State Parliaments shall be subordinate,22
NA,"bodies. I f given effect, this proposal",22
NA,would involve the abolition of the,22
NA,upper houses and the positions of State,22
NA,"governors, and would tend to economy",22
NA,and efficiency. There would be only the,22
NA,Governor-General of Australia as the re-,22
NA,presentative of His Majesty the K i n g .,22
NA,Reconstruction i n the way propsed would,22
NA,involve less centralization than unifica-,22
NA,tion.,22
Mr GARDINER ,Woul d the provincial,22
NA,parliaments have sovereign powers?,22
Mr FORDE ,No ; sovereign powers,22
NA,would be vested only i n the Fede-,22
NA,ral Parliament. There would be a,22
NA,greater number of provincial govern-,22
NA,ments than we now have of State govern-,22
NA,ments: but the number of legislators,22
NA,would be reduced. The cost of,22
NA,government i n Australia to-day is,22
NA,excessive. I f the figures are looked,22
NA,up it will be found ' that it,22
NA,"amounts approximately to £1,100,000 a",22
NA,"year, or 3s. 8d. per head of the popula-",22
NA,tion. We have 645 members of Parlia-,22
NA,ment. The cost of running the electoral,22
NA,"departments is, approximately, for the",22
NA,"Commonwealth £100,000, and for the",22
NA,"States £83,000, or a total of £183,000",22
NA,per annum. There is to-day. a duplica-,22
NA,"tion of electoral rolls, and i n any .year i n",22
NA,which elections are held there is consider-,22
NA,the able additional expenditure on electoral,22
NA,affairs.,22
Mr THOMPSON ,Th e Labour party has,22
NA,never put that scheme before the country.,22
Mr FORDE ,"Yes , i t has; and I have",22
NA,referred to i t on every occasion upon,22
NA,which I have had an opportunity to dis-,22
NA,cuss the formation of new States.,22
Mr HUGHES ,Ha s the proposal out-,22
NA,lined by the honorable member ever been,22
NA,put before the Commonwealth?,22
Mr FORDE ,Yes . I t is included i n,22
NA,the amended platform of the Labour,22
NA,to party. I t was included at the instigation,22
NA,of Mr Theodore at the conference which,22
NA,to was held i n Brisbane i n 1921. Pre-,22
NA,1 viously the Labour party went somewhat,22
NA,into detail and set out the number of,22
NA,States into which the Commonwealth,22
NA,should be divided.,22
Mr HUGHES ,Th e honorable member,22
NA,is referring to the Federal platform of,22
NA,the Labour party.,22
Mr FORDE ,Yes . Mr Theodore,22
NA,"said, "" Let us deal with principles. When",22
NA,we get into power we can give effect to,22
NA,"our platform, and can then work out the",22
NA,"details.""",22
Mr THOMPSON , Has the Labour,22
NA,party abandoned the idea of subdividing,22
NA,Australia into 31 provinces?,22
Mr FORDE ,Yes . That was con-,22
NA,tained i n a plank arbitrarily laid down,22
NA,bv conference some years ago on the mo-,22
NA,tion of a certain member of the Labour,22
NA,"party, who was very enthusiastic about",23
NA,the formation of new States. He pro-,23
NA,posed that Australia should be divided,23
NA,into 31 States. That proposal has been,23
NA,set aside and the new platform of the,23
NA,Labour party takes its place.,23
NA,proposed that the provinces may deal,23
NA,"with purely local matters, such as land",23
NA,"settlement, police, local authorities,",23
NA,"tion, health, and the administration of",23
NA,justice. The control of railways is a,23
NA,matter which should be l e f t for future,23
NA,consideration. I t is proposed that un-,23
NA,limited power should be vested i n the,23
NA,"Commonwealth Parliament, and that",23
NA,there should be a greater number of,23
NA,provincial or State Parliaments of a much,23
NA,simpler form and involving less expendi-,23
NA,ture. Their membership would be,23
NA,"reduced, and there would be greater",23
NA,"economy and efficiency of government,",23
NA,"because the governing authority, under",23
NA,"the system proposed, would be nearer to",23
NA,the people than i t is under existing con-,23

NA,sheep run covering an area of 100,23
NA,square miles that portion w i t h in reason-,23
NA,able distance of the head station is gene-,23
NA,rally better looked after than the outlying,23
NA,portions. I t should tend to greater effi-,23
NA,ciency and economy of government to,23
NA,establish provincial parliaments w i th the,23
NA,necessary powers f o r all local develop-,23
NA,mental purposes. The members of such,23
NA,parliaments would be more conversant,23
NA,"w i th local conditions, and better informed,",23
NA,of the requirements of the people.,23
NA,hope that the Treasurer w i l l announce,23
NA,"the policy of the Government, and tell",23
NA,us what i t intends to do i n this matter.,23
NA,For four years I have anxiously waited,23
NA,to hear h i m utter a word as to what he,23
NA,has been doing i n the councils of the,23
NA,Cabinet. I should like to know what he,23
NA,"has done of a practical nature, apart f r o m",23
NA,flamboyant speeches and the uttering of,23
NA,numerous platitudes on the hustings.,23
NA,"I have waited i n vain f o r information,",23
NA,on the subject f r o m the honorable gentle-,23
NA,"man, and I challenge h i m now to rise to",23
NA,his feet and tell the House his policy,23
NA,and the policy of the Government.,23
Mr ABBOTT ,Gwydir) [ 3 . 2 8 ] - I do,23
NA,not intend to take up very much of the,23
NA,time of the House i n discussing this,23
NA,motion. I n his previous speeches the,23
NA,honorable member f o r New England,23
NA,"( Mr Thompson), has put the case f o r",23
NA,"the New States movement very clearly,",23
NA,and w i th a great deal of consistency. I,23
NA,should like to say that when a matter,23
NA,like this is being discussed i t is a great,23
NA,p i t y ' t h a t any honorable members should,23
NA,make i t an opportunity f o r a very bitter,23
NA,"I t is personal attack, and f o r the pouring out",23
NA,of an accumulation of bile.,23
Mr FORDE , I made no personal,23
NA,educa- attack. I wanted some announcement,23
NA,f r o m the Treasurer.,23
Mr ABBOTT , I noticed that the,23
NA,honorable member also said that Senator,23
NA,Thompson is very weak indeed on this,23
NA,question of the formation of new States.,23
NA,The honorable member measured Senator,23
NA,Thompson's enthusiasm f o r the cause by,23
NA,the space he has used i n Hansard. I f,23
NA,the space used i n Hansard is to be taken,23
NA,as a measure of enthusiasm and support,23
NA,"for a cause, the honorable member f o r",23
NA,Capricornia must always put forward ex-,23
NA,ceedingly good cases.,23
Mr FORDE ,Th e Treasurer told the,23
NA,people of my district that. I never said,23
NA,"anything on the subject here, but re-",23
NA,served what I had .to say f o r Rockhamp-,23
NA,ton.,23
Mr ABBOTT , A l l that the Trea-,23
NA,surer ever said about the honorable mem-,23
NA,ber f o r Capricornia was that he never,23
NA,did anything f o r new States beyond,23
NA,the speaking of w i l d and whirl-,23
NA,ing words. There is no question,23
NA,of the Treasurer's belief i n the New,23
NA,"States movement, or of the sincerity",23
NA,I of the honorable gentleman towards i t .,23
NA,The people of northern New South,23
NA,"Wales, and all who know the honorable",23
NA,"gentleman, are aware that i n h i m we",23
NA,have a most stalwart supporter of the,23
NA,movement. I do not propose to dwell on,23
NA,that aspect of the matter any further.,23
NA,I t seemed to me that the time is ripe,23
NA,for the subdivision of Australia into a,23
NA,greater number of States. Every one,23
NA,must now agree that an enor-,23
NA,mous continent like this cannot con-,23
NA,tinue to be governed as i t has been,23
NA,"governed i n the past, by authorities i n",23
NA,charge of great areas. I t has been shown,23
NA,that a near perspective is necessary f o r,23
NA,good government. When we consider,23
NA,that what w i l l practically be a new state,23
NA,is to be formed i n the Northern Terri -,23
NA,"tory, and that i t has been suggested that",23
NA,a new province should be formed i n the,23
NA,"north-west of Western Australia, i t is",23
NA,clear that the trend of public opinion is,23
NA,i n the direction of the New States,24
NA,movement. I have always regarded,24
NA,Victoria as illustrating the efficiency,24
NA,with which the government of rural,24
NA,affairs can be conducted i n a com-,24
NA,paratively small area. Honorable,24
NA,members may recollect that when the,24
NA,other day I deplored the fact that a great,24
NA,many people are leaving the land I,24
NA,pointed out that the only State that,24
NA,showed an increase in the number of,24
NA,small farmers is Victoria. This fact,24
NA,supports the argument that smaller,24
NA,States than we now have are necessary,24
NA,to secure better and more successful go-,24
NA,vernment. I am right i n saying that this,24
NA,"is a matter which should have the"" close",24
NA,attention of the Federal Parliament. I t,24
NA,is to secure that attention that the honor-,24
NA,able member f o r New England has sub-,24
NA,mitted his motion. I suggest to the hon-,24
NA,orable member that he should amend his,24
NA,motion to r e a d -,24
NA,That the question of the method of estab-,24
NA,lishing new States should be considered in,24
NA,conjunction with other constitutional ques-,24
NA,tions at the proposed constitutional session of,24
NA,this Parliament.,24
NA,"Such a session, we understand, is to take",24
NA,place at Canberra next year.,24
Mr FORDE ,I s this the bridge the Go-,24
NA,vernment has built f o r the honorable,24
NA,member ?,24
Mr ABBOTT ,Th e constitution of,24
NA,new States is a very important matter.,24
NA,I t is one which should be approached i n,24
NA,"an open manner, and should not be used",24
NA,for the purpose of personal attacks. I f,24
NA,the honorable member for New England,24
NA,will accept my suggestion the whole,24
NA,matter of the formation of new States,24
NA,can be very f u l l y dealt with at the forth -,24
NA,coming constitutional session of the,24
NA,Federal Parliament at Canberra.,24
NA,move-,24
NA,"That all the words after the word "" That",24
NA,be loft out with a view to inserting in lieu,24
NA,"thereof- "" the question of the method of",24

Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON ,Lang) [3.32].,24
NA,The honorable member for,24
NA,"England ( Mr Thompson) tried, by i n -",24
NA,"terjection, to correct what he considered",24
NA,a misstatement of fact by the honorable,24
NA,member f o r Capricornia ( Mr Forde) re-,24
NA,flecting upon the sincerity of the Trea-,24
NA,[135],24
NA,surer with regard to the New States move-,24
NA,ment. I learn f r o m the honorable mem-,24
NA,ber f o r New England that the Treasurer,24
NA,was present at the first meeting of the,24
NA,"Parliamentary New States Committee,",24
NA,"that 'he joined the committee then, and has",24
NA,attended and addressed several meetings,24
NA,since. The honorable member f o r New,24
NA,England having spoken has not an op-,24
NA,portunity to correct the honorable mem-,24
NA,"ber for Capricornia, who probably quite",24
NA,unintentionally misrepresented the posi-,24
NA,tion.,24
Mr FORDE , I was referring to the fact,24
NA,that several members of the New States,24
NA,Committee told me that the Treasurer,24
NA,(Dr Earle Page) excused his absence on,24
NA,the ground that he was a member of,24
NA,the Cabinet.,24
Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON ,Th e true,24
NA,position is as stated by the honorable,24
NA,member f o r New England. W i t h regard,24
NA,to the motion under discussion I am,24
NA,afraid that any movement of the kind,24
NA,suggested would not meet w i t h the appro-,24
NA,bation of the public generally. Certain,24
NA,members of the Federal Parliament,24
NA,"would appear, i f I may say so,",24
NA,to have developed a referendum mania,24
NA,during recent months. To submit,24
NA,this question with others to the,24
NA,people would only confuse the issues.,24
NA,I do not think that the majority of the,24
NA,electors would approve of the expense i n -,24
NA,volved i n another reference to them,24
NA,"on a matter of this kind, which certainly",24
NA,has not received from the general public,24
NA,that attention which the importance at-,24
NA,tached to i t by those responsible for this,24
NA,motion seems to warrant. I think that,24
NA,the trend of opinion with the general,24
NA,publio is that Australia is already too,24
NA,"much governed, that i t has too many par-",24
NA,"liaments, and that instead of an extension",24
NA,I of governmental powers through the,24
NA,medium of the establishment of new,24
NA,States involving the creation of new par-,24
NA,liaments and all the paraphernalia of new,24
NA,Public Services leading to increased taxa-,24
NA,tion of the people who have to bear the,24
NA,"burden, there should be a simplification of-",24
NA,our system of government. M y own,24
NA,opinion is i n favour of an extension of,24
NA,New local governing powers under an arrange-,24
NA,ment by which the whole of Australia,24
NA,"could be divided into provinces, but not",24
NA,with legislative powers under constitu-,24
NA,tions similar to those under which the,24
NA,States are now working. W i t h our limited,24
NA,"population, and with the unavoidable i",25
NA,crease i n the cost of government entailed,25
NA,"by the creation of new States, I think the",25
NA,present proposal would not be favorably,25
NA,"received by the people, but i f a scheme",25
NA,could be devised to reduce the numerical,25
NA,strength of the existing State Par-,25
NA,"liaments, - and the cost of existing State",25
NA,"Governments, i t would meet with more",25
NA,general approbation than would a,25
NA,proposal which is likely to increase,25
NA,the burden on the people. I do not feel,25
NA,inclined to support either the motion or,25
NA,"the amendment, and I think the Govern-",25
NA,ment would be extremely ill-advised to,25
NA,bring down a measure of the kind sug-,25
NA,gested at tbe present time.,25
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Cowper-Trea -,25
NA,surer) [3.39] - I regret that the honorable,25
NA,member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde),25
NA,should have imported into this debate a,25
NA,"great deal of persona] bitterness, but I",25
NA,- have no intention of following him along,25
NA,those lines. The honorable member is a,25
NA,most unfortunate exponent of the opinion,25
NA,"he is supporting at the present time, that",25
NA,something should be done; because he,25
NA,happens to have been during his career in,25
NA,in the Queensland Parliament a follower,25
NA,"of a government which, after supporting",25
NA,a motion for the subdivision of Queens-,25
NA,"land into three parts, took no further",25
NA,"action' in the matter, although it was in",25
NA,absolute control of the affairs of the,25
NA,States. In the parliament in which the,25
NA,motion which the honorable member,25
NA,quotes with so much approval was brought,25
NA,"forward, there was no upper bouse to re-",25
NA,strict the actions of the Legislative,25
NA,"Assembly, and the government itself had",25
NA,"an ample majority, which would have",25
NA,enabled it to bring about the subdivision,25
NA,of Queensland so greatly desired by the,25
NA,honorable member. He was completely,25
NA,satisfied with the passing of a pious,25
NA,"resolution, when there was no obstacle",25
NA,in the way of giving effect to it. I t is,25
NA,unfortunate that the honorable mem-,25
NA,ber should take up in this Parliament the,25
NA,attitude he takes up now. When the,25
NA,right honorable member for North Sydney,25
NA,"( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister in 1921,",25
NA,he introduced a bill for the summoning of,25
NA,a convention to consider the amend-,25
NA,"ment of our Constitution, includ-",25
NA,"ing, of course, the method of creating new",25
NA,"States, which the honorable member says",25
NA,"is of such urgent importance, and for",25
NA,which he says the Labour party has,25
NA,fought all the time; but the Leader of the,25
NA,"n - Opposition ( Mr Charlton) moved, "" That",25
NA,"the bill be read this day six months,""",25
NA,which really meant shelving i t . During,25
NA,the debate on that bill the Labour party,25
NA,had an opportunity to show its,25
NA,bona fides i n regard to the matter.,25
NA,I took the opportunity to point out,25
NA,how the - proposed convention could,25
NA,do its work i n the most satisfactory way>,25
NA,and I submitted amendments i n accord-,25
NA,"ance with the Country party's policy,",25
NA,which has just been read out by the hon-,25
NA,orable member f o r Capricornia ( Mr .,25
NA,"Forde). Unfortunately, an honorable",25
NA,"member moved, "" That the question be now",25
NA,"put,"" and every member of the Labour",25
NA,"party, with the exception of three, voted",25
NA,"for that motion, i n the belief that i t was",25
NA,the quickest way of bringing about the,25
NA,desire of their Leader to shelve the,25
NA,matter altogether. That is what has,25
NA,"occurred i n this Parliament, and the",25
NA,honorable member f o r Capricornia can,25
NA,say nothing which w i l l hide the facts.,25
NA,His further inconsistency is shown by,25
NA,his attitude to the motion of the honor-,25
NA,able mem'ber f or New England ( Mr .,25
NA,Thompson). I f there is one thing more,25
NA,than anything else that is required to,25
NA,"secure what he desires, and what every",25
NA,one knows I desire- a more satisfactory,25
NA,and economical system of government i n,25
NA,"Australia, and to give a bigger impetus",25
NA,to the development of what arc now,25
NA,outlying areas by the creation of new,25
NA,States-i t is united action in this,25
NA,chamber by those who hold similar,25
NA,"views. Yet the honorable member,",25
NA,"for a quarter of an hour, in-",25
NA,dulged i n a tirade of merciless,25
NA,"abuse that cannot help the matter at all,",25
NA,whereas we need all the help we can i n,25
NA,the fight f o r the conditions we think,25
NA,should be brought about i n Australia. The,25
NA,honorable member said tbat those who,25
NA,are interested i n this movement have done,25
NA,nothing during the last three years. The,25
NA,people outside have had an opportunity,25
NA,of judging the record of myself and,25
NA,others who stand f o r the establishment,25
NA,of new States. N o t merely was the hon-,25
NA,orable member f o r New England ( Mr .,25
NA,"Thompson), who stood by this'proposal,",25
NA,"returned by an increased majority, and",25
NA,the honorable member f o r Richmond,25
NA,( Mr R. Green) returned i n the face,25
NA,"of great opposition, but the honor-",25
NA,"able member f o r Gwydir ( Mr Abbott),",25
NA,"who, during the whole campaign, advo-",26
NA,"cated the creation of new States, de-",26
NA,feated his opponent. The whole,26
NA,of northern New South Wales was,26
NA,thus solidly arrayed behind the New,26
NA,States Movement. The proposal of the,26
NA,honorable member f or New England is,26
NA,"to have a referendum on this issue, but",26
NA,he has accepted the amendment of the,26
NA,"honorable member f o r Gwydir, which the",26
NA,Government regards as the proper method,26
NA,of dealing with the question. Ministers,26
NA,think that the creation of new States,26
NA,should be dealt w i th i n connexion,26
NA,with the general amendment of the Con-,26
NA,stitution. When the right honorable,26
NA,member f o r Nort h Sydney ( Mr Hughes),26
NA,brought down his proposal f o r a conven-,26
NA,"tion, that convention was to deal w i t h",26
NA,the proposals f o r an alteration of the Con-,26
NA,stitution i n a satisfactory and proper,26
NA,way. W i t h other Ministers I have al-,26
NA,ways contended that there is a much,26
NA,better chance of bringing about the crea-,26
NA,"tion of new States i f , at the same time,",26
NA,some redistribution of the relative powers,26
NA,of the Commonwealth and the States can,26
NA,"be secured, than by simply having",26
NA,a straight-out fight on the New States,26
NA,issue. The remarks of the honorable,26
NA,member f or Capricornia. i n regard to the,26
NA,"proposals of the Labour party, show that",26
NA,"that is also his opinion. I urge him, there-",26
NA,"fore, to set aside his personal feelings i n",26
NA,the matter and j o i n with others i n the,26
NA,effort to see that this is done. As to why,26
NA,nothing was done i n the matter during,26
NA,"the last Parliament, despite the Prime",26
NA,Minister's assurance to a deputation that,26
NA,opportunity would be given f o r the dis-,26
NA,cussion of changes of the Constitution,26
NA,"by - Parliament, every one",26
NA,that when the Leader of the Labour,26
NA,party challenged the Government to go,26
NA,"to the country on another issue, the Go-",26
NA,vernment accepted the challenge and,26
NA,fought that issue before the electors.,26
NA,But the dissolution abridged by nearly,26
NA,"a year the life of that Parliament, and",26
NA,thus no opportunity was afforded to i t to,26
NA,discuss proposals for the amendment,26
NA,of the Constitution. The Government,26
NA,has already announced that as soon as,26
NA,the new Parliament meets at Canberra i t,26
NA,will have an opportunity of discussing pro-,26
NA,"posed alterations of the Constitution, and",26
NA,the New States issue will be one of the,26
NA,matters discussed. Every one is agreed,26
NA,that i t is time that wider means of secur-,26
NA,ing the further subdivision of Australia,26
NA,than now exist should be devised. No sub-,26
NA,division can take place now except at the,26
NA,will of the Parliament which con-,26
NA,trols the territory where the people,26
NA,desire to subdivide. The time has,26
NA,come when I think there should be an,26
NA,alternative method of deciding the matter,26
NA,"-whe n the people of a State, as well as",26
NA,"the Parliament of the State, should have",26
NA,some say i n i t . A review of the history,26
NA,of the subdivision of Australia shows that,26
NA,there is very little chance of the subdivi-,26
NA,sion of a State being brought about by,26
NA,an appeal to a State Parliament.. A t the,26
NA,time of the separation of Victoria from.,26
NA,"New Soutli Wales, a Legislative Council,",26
NA,"which sat inSydney, controlled the' whole",26
NA,eastern portion of Australia. The Port,26
NA,"Phillip District, as i t was then known,",26
NA,had the privilege of returning six repre-,26
NA,"sentatives to that body, but because of",26
NA,"the difficulties of communication, due to",26
NA,the great distance ' separating Sydney,26
NA,"from Melbourne, i t was found necessary",26
NA,to select Sydney residents as its - represen-,26
NA,tatives. The people of what is now Vic-,26
NA,"toria, became absolutely sick of that sys-",26
NA,"tem of government, and in despair elected",26
NA,"Earl Grey, the then Secretary of State",26
NA,"for the Colonies, to represent them, be-",26
NA,"cause, although he was living i n England,",26
NA,they said he could represent them just,26
NA,as well as any one living i n Sydney.,26
NA,"Finally, they secured self-government by",26
NA,an appeal to the British Parlia-,26
NA,ment. They could never have got,26
NA,it from the New South Wales,26
NA,"Parliament, because i t is not natural for",26
NA,any parliament to give up any power i t,26
NA,possesses or territory i t controls. Queens-,26
NA,knows land also wasseparated from New Sputh,26
NA,Wales as the result of a direct appeal to,26
NA,the Imperial Parliament. We claim now,26
NA,"that the time is ripe when the Common-,",26
NA,wealth Parliament should be put practi-,26
NA,cally i n the position occupied by the I m -,26
NA,perial Parliament prior to the establish-,26
NA,mentof federation. B u t that matter we,26
NA,"say should be determined, not by a re-",26
NA,ferendum of the people on this particular,26
NA,"issue, but along with other proposals to",26
NA,alter the Constitution and secure a re-,26
NA,distribution of powers between the,26
NA,Commonwealth and the States. During,26
NA,the last three or four years State Parlia-,26
NA,ments have come to the conclusion that,26
NA,that is the proper method to be adopted.,26
NA,"For instance, in the year 1922 Sir George",26
NA,"Fuller, who was then Premier of New",27
NA,"South Wales, wrote to the Prime Minister",27
NA,advising him that the following resolutions,27
NA,had been passed i n the New South Wales,27
NA,Parliament: -,27
NA,"1. That, in the opinion of this House, the",27
NA,large area of the State of New South Wales,27
NA,makes it desirable that the creation of a,27
NA,separate State in Northern New South Wales,27
NA,should be taken into early consideration by a,27
NA,Federal convention summoned for the purpose,27
NA,"of reconsidering, both the present boundaries",27
NA,of the States and the distribution of the legishonorable member for Gwydir.,27
NA,lative powers between States and Common-,27
NA,wealth.,27
NA,2. That this resolution be communicated to,27
NA,the Federal Government and the Governments,27
NA,of the States witb a view to securing their,27
NA,concurrence.,27
NA,"On the 4th October, 1922, the Queens-",27
NA,land -Parliament passed this resolu-,27
NA,tion : -,27
NA,"That, in the opinion of this Parliament,",27
NA,time has arrived for the remodelling of the,27
NA,"Commonwealth Constitution, providing for the",27
NA,subdivision of Australia into a greater number,27
NA,"of self-governing States, making for more",27
NA,"economical and effective government, and also",27
NA,providing an easy'method for the people living,27
NA,in any district sucb as Central Queensland or,27
NA,"Northern New South Wales, to obtain self-",27
NA,"government, and that the Prime Minister of",27
NA,Australia be urged to take tbe necessary steps,27
NA,to bring about these reforms.,27
NA,"I t is evident that, not merely i n Federal",27
NA,"circles, but also i n the State Parliaments,",27
NA,and throughout Australia the opinion is,27
NA,held that the creation of new States oan be,27
NA,dealt with only i n the course of a general,27
NA,review of the Constitution. The amend-,27
NA,ment moved by the honorable member,27
NA,for Gwydir proposes to refer this matter,27
NA,to the special constitutional session to,27
NA,"be held next year, and the Government is",27
NA,quite prepared to accept the amendment,27
NA,and act upon i t .,27
Mr HUGHES , N o r t h Sydney) [3.53],27
NA,-W e had hoped to hear this afternoon,27
NA,from the honorable member for Mel-,27
NA,bourne ( Dr Maloney) a speech on his,27
NA,proposal f o r the compilation of another,27
NA,"Domesday Book, and, incidentally, an",27
NA,historical survey dating from the Norman,27
NA,invasion of England. On that sea we,27
NA,were to have voyaged u n t i l 9 o'clock to-,27
NA,"night, when the discussion of grievances",27
NA,"is the order of the day. I n place of that,",27
NA,this debate on the New States motion has,27
NA,"been resumed, somewhat abruptly, and",27
NA,we have to address ourselves to i t without,27
NA,the advantage of that preparation which,27
NA,makes f or effective and interesting dis-,27
NA,cussion. The honorable member f o r,27
NA,"Capricornia ( Mr Forde) contrived,",27
NA,"on the spur of the moment, to",27
NA,introduce into his speech a per-,27
NA,"sonal element, which at one stage pro-",27
NA,mised to be highly entertaining. Un-,27
NA,"fortunately, I suppose the terms of the",27
NA,motion prevented him from doing f u l l,27
NA,"justice to the matter, and so we are left",27
NA,with no alternative but to deal with the,27
NA,proposal moved by the honorable mem-,27
NA,ber for New England ( MT . Thompson),27
NA,and the amendment submitted by the,27
NA,The,27
NA,gravamen of the complaint of the,27
NA,honorable member for Capricornia was,27
NA,that the Treasurer had said that the,27
NA,New States movement had not flourished,27
NA,as i t should have done because the,27
NA,Labour party had fallen down on the,27
NA,job. To which the honorable member,27
NA,"for Capricornia replied, "" That is not",27
NA,the true. How could 29 members do that,27
NA,which requires the approval of a majo-,27
NA,r i t y of the House ? I t is you who have,27
NA,"fallen down on the j o b . "" The honor-",27
NA,"able member, i n the course - of his",27
NA,"speech, recalled to my mind the",27
NA,time when I had the honour of leading,27

NA,"surer, sitting on the ministerial cross",27
NA,"bench, delivered speeches on the New",27
NA,"States movement, of which he was the",27
NA,chief banner-bearer. Many times we,27
NA,heard h i m wax eloquent upon this sub-,27
NA,"ject, and those who sat with h i m sup-",27
NA,ported him with an enthusiasm that al-,27
NA,most equalled his own. By the creation,27
NA,of new States we were to struggle out of,27
NA,the Slough of Despond and make our way,27
NA,to the celestial fields. B u t with the re-,27
NA,volution of the political wheel the honor-,27
NA,able member f o r Cowper was promoted to,27
NA,a position of authority. He may be,27
NA,imagined now as seated where he has,27
NA,"merely to press an electric button, and",27
NA,"l o ! i n turn come f o r t h a budget, a sugar",27
NA,policy-abou t which we heard a,27
NA,good deal at one time-o r a shin-,27
NA,ing array of new States. B ut these are,27
NA,as yet without substance. As for this,27
NA,"New States movement, the bride is",27
NA,arrayed in her wedding finery; but the,27
NA,bridegroom cometh not -As i n the,27
NA,"song, the anxious bride, her once",27
NA,rosy cheeks pale and her manner de-,27
NA,"pressed, is "" W a i t i n g at the Church,""",27
NA,"but i n the language of the streets,",27
NA,""" There is nothing doing."" To adopt",27
NA,"another metaphor, the Treasurer being",27
NA,"haled into court, and electing to make a",27
NA,statement rather than enter the witne39,28
NA,box where he could be cross-examined-,28
NA,most defendants consider the first alter-,28
NA,native the wiser course-tell s us the,28
NA,"story, moving,> but not tragic, of tho",28
NA,delay in realizing his fond dream during,28
NA,the last three years. He explained why,28
NA,he has found i t impossible to proceed,28
NA,with this great reform o'f Avhich he is the,28
NA,principal protagonist. The first year,28
NA,was taken up i n rapt retrospect of that,28
NA,election campaign f r o m which he ap-,28
NA,peared unlikely at one stage to emerge,28
NA,w i th much credit; but out of darkness,28
NA,"came light, and he arrived breathless, but",28
NA,"happy, where he is now. Then f o r twelve",28
NA,months his eyes were still dazzled with,28
NA,"the unaccustomed glare, and action was",28
NA,"impossible. I n the next year, being",28
NA,"then firmly in the saddle,",28
NA,might have been expected to take,28
NA,"the jump, but for some unexplained",28
NA,reason he baulked the fence and arrived,28
NA,nowhere. The thir d year brought the,28
NA,shadow of things sufficiently ominous to,28
NA,"damp his enthusiasm, and again he did",28
NA,nothing. Then followed the last general,28
NA,election-an d here we fire. Stated i n that,28
NA,"way, the honorable gentleman's explana-",28
NA,tion covers the whole ground so amply as,28
NA,to leave not a chink through which the,28
NA,demon of doubt can enter. But I am,28
NA,bound to say that to those who believe,28
NA,in the New States movement-an d I,28
NA,suppose there are still some who do-i t,28
NA,"is strange, to say the least, that the",28
NA,Treasurer has not been able to persuade,28
NA,his colleagues to do' anything to further,28
NA,this great reform. Because of his ad-,28
NA,vocacy of i t he got into public,28
NA,"life, and when he still",28
NA,"hesitant on the threshold,",28
NA,three years and four months of,28
NA,"office, and after six years of unremitting",28
NA,"public effort, one becomes a little doubtful",28
NA,whether anything can come of this move-,28
NA,ment. The Treasurer pointed out the dif-,28
NA,"ficulties i n its way, but these are not new,",28
NA,"and when a few years ago I "" ventured to",28
NA,"point them out to him, he received them",28
NA,with every evidence of incredulity. I,28
NA,remember that a most enthusiastic depu-,28
NA,tation waited upon me at Tamworth.,28
NA,Nothing would serve those advocates of,28
NA,the New States movement but an amend-,28
NA,"ment of the Constitution, by which a sure",28
NA,and speedy way would be found into the,28
NA,heart of the citadel. I pointed out that,28
NA,"an amendment of the Constitution, as",28
NA,"ordinarily understood, would bring them",28
NA,no nearer to their goal than the alterna-,28
NA,tive method set out i n that instrument.,28
NA,The fact cannot be over-emphasized that,28
NA,before a State can be subdivided its,28
NA,"parliament must approve, and any",28
NA,amendment of the Constitution needs,28
NA,the consent of the majorit y of,28
NA,the people voting i n a majority of the,28
NA,States. Before tbe Constitution can be,28
NA,amended to provide for the creation of,28
NA,"new States, the proposal must have the",28
NA,approval not only of the majority of,28
NA,"people voting i n the majority of States,",28
NA,but also of a majorit y of the people i n the,28
NA,"State .to be cut up, and i f i t is desired to",28
NA,"subdivide all the States, a majority of the",28
NA,people i n all the States must be i n favour,28
NA,of the subdivision. Human nature being,28
NA,"he what i t is, the day is very far distant",28
NA,"when our fellow citizens will agree ""to such",28
NA,"a proposal. A great State like ""Western",28
NA,"Australia, where the citizens i n the closely",28
NA,settled parts are so remote from those i n,28
NA,the outlying provinces that they seem a,28
NA,"world apart, is i n an entirely different",28
NA,"position from New South Wales, whose",28
NA,smaller area is gridironed by railways and,28
NA,"roads, and whose people have a community,",28
NA,of feeling which inspires i n them a more,28
NA,intense local patriotism. I t is eminently,28
NA,desirable that there should repose i n some,28
NA,authority means whereby at the proper,28
NA,"stage of development in, any part of Aus-",28
NA,tralia new States may be created.,28
NA,Those who belong to the New States,28
NA,movement ought to be told plainly,28
NA,"that no new States convention, and no",28
NA,"amendment of the Constitution, w i l l",28
NA,stands bring them nearer to their desire than,28
NA,after they are at this moment. When I ven-,28
NA,tured to recommend the Tamworth,28
NA,deputation to ask the Parliament,28
NA,of New South Wales to do that which,28
NA,"they thought should be done-which ,",28
NA,with certain reservations that I then,28
NA,"stated, I favoured myself-the y despised",28
NA,"the recommendation. Like Naaman, the",28
NA,"Syrian, when told to bathe seven",28
NA,"times i n the Jordan, they asked",28
NA,"were not Abana and Pharfar, rivers of",28
NA,"Damascus, better than all the waters of",28
NA,Israel. They preferred to go the long,28
NA,way round to attain their objective. B u t,28
NA,"they are no nearer to attaining i t ; nay,",28
NA,they are further from the goal to-day,28
NA,than ever. The New States move-,28
NA,ment has been with,28
NA,"time, and has served",29
NA,ing horse for political,29
NA,"for individual politicians, who have used",29
NA,"it for their own ends, but have done no-",29
NA,thing to bring about a reform which they,29
NA,declare to be essential to the welfare of,29
NA,this country. There can be no subdivi-,29
NA,"sion of any State, without the consent of",29
NA,its people. If every elector in the Com-,29
NA,"monwealth, except those of",29
NA,favoured the subdivision of that,29
NA,"Tasmania's "" No"" would",29
NA,"Australia's "" Aye."" No",29
NA,counts in this matter,29
NA,majority of the. electors,29
NA,State which it is proposed,29
NA,divide. If it is desired to bring about,29
NA,the reform by first amending the Consti-,29
NA,"tution, it will be necessary to get also a",29
NA,majority of the States and a majority of,29
NA,the people of Australia in favour of the,29
NA,proposed amendment. It has been sug-,29
NA,gested that an act of the British,29
NA,ment could be passed,29
NA,our 'Constitution; but,29
NA,British Parliament to pass such a,29
NA,measure would be an affront to the,29
NA,"dignity of the Commonwealth,",29
NA,people would not tolerate.,29
NA,"tion is the charter of our rights, and,",29
NA,although it is in form,29
NA,"statute, it was approved by the people of",29
NA,this country before the British,29
NA,ment was asked to give it legal sanction.,29
NA,"It is now, in fact, no longer a British",29
NA,statute; it is the charter of our liberties,29
NA,"and rights, and we alone ought to say",29
NA,what shall be done with it. I should,29
NA,oppose tooth and nail a proposal for the,29
NA,creation of new States by a statute of the,29
NA,British Parliament. I say,29
NA,against the holding of a,29
NA,"convention-I believe in it-but,",29
NA,"case, the situation to be faced will be the",29
NA,same. It was suggested to me at Tam-,29
NA,worth-and the honorable member for,29
NA,New England seems to hold the same,29
NA,view-that there is some way of evading,29
NA,the difficulty. There is no way of,29
NA,evading it. If it is desired to sub-,29
NA,stitute for section 128 of the Con-,29
NA,"stitution an entirely new section, under",29
NA,"which what we wish to do could be done,",29
NA,there is no way by which that,29
NA,can be made except that provided,29
NA,section 128as it exists. The,29
NA,of the people of the States out of which,29
NA,"new States are to be carved, must ap-",29
NA,Mr Hughet.,29
NA,as a stalk- prove of the amendment. The advocates,29
NA,"parties, and of new States should realize that. I f pub-",29
NA,lic opinion on this subject were suffi-,29
NA,"ciently strong to make i t an election issue,",29
NA,i t would not necessarily follow that the,29
NA,people would give the authority needed,29
NA,to consummate the purpose i n view. B u t,29
NA,"the New States question, which was con-",29
NA,tinually dinned i n our ears a few years,29
NA,"Tasmania, ago, has now become a faint and",29
NA,"State, negligible echo.",29
Mr RODGERS ,Th e movement started,29
NA,majority in a parochial instead of a national way.,29
Mr HUGHES , I have not said that.,29
NA,of the I am content to declare myself,29
NA,to sub- in favour of the creation of means,29
NA,for making new States from time,29
NA,to time as the development of the,29
NA,Commonwealth may require. But that,29
NA,cannot be done u n t i l the people,29
NA,are enthusiastically i n favour of i t .,29
NA,What was malleable three years ago,29
NA,"Parlia- has now become cold, and has set",29
NA,to amend hard; what was conceivable has now,29
NA,to - ask the become so remotely possible that i t has,29
NA,passed out of the sphere of prac-,29
NA,"tical politics, so that the echoes that",29
NA,which the are raised by this debate sound to us like,29
NA,The Constitu- the reading of the names on the tomb-,29
NA,stones i n a cemetery.,29
Mr THOMPSON ,New England),29
NA,[4.16] - I accept the amendment with ap-,29
NA,"Parlia- proval, because i t is the suggestion of the",29
NA,"Government, and provides the most sen-",29
NA,sible way out of this difficulty. This de-,29
NA,bate has shown that great constitutional,29
NA,difficulties surround this matter which,29
NA,require the consideration of honorable,29
NA,members at a special constitutional ses-,29
NA,sion. We have had the definite announce-,29
NA,nothing ment of the Government that next year,29
NA,constitutional -presumabl y when we are at Canberra-,29
NA,in any there will be a special session to deal with,29
NA,constitutional issues. That is one of the,29
NA,most important statements that has been,29
NA,made by the Government since this Par-,29
NA,"liament came into existence, because i t",29
NA,opens up a vista of big possibilities for,29
NA,Australia. As secretary to the A l l -,29
NA,"Australian New State Movement, and to",29
NA,the Northern New South Wales Move-,29
NA,"ment particularly, which have ardently",29
NA,"advocated the subdivision of the State, I",29
NA,amendment can safely say that the proposal of the,29
NA,by Government to accept this matter as a,29
NA,majority question for the agenda-paper at the,29
NA,special constitutional session is entirely,29
NA,acceptable. I f we decide to hold a re-,29
NA,ferendum on the subject during the life,29
NA,"of this Parliament, we shall still be faced",30
NA,with constitutional difficulties i n estab-,30
NA,lishing the new States. For that reason,30
NA,"i t is better, especially as this Parliament",30
NA,has from two and a half to three years to,30
NA,"go, to relegate this question to a special",30
NA,constitutional session. A t such a session,30
NA,there will be a different atmosphere from,30
NA,that existing to-day. Although tais,30
NA,question has been threshed out from one,30
NA,"end of Australia to the other, and al-",30
NA,though the Labour party has flaunted its,30
NA,unification scheme before the people f o r,30
NA,"several years, there are, when i t is being",30
NA,"discussed here to-day, empty benches on",30
NA,the Labour side. When honorable mem-,30
NA,bers of the Labour party have an oppor-,30
NA,tunity to discuss their unification pro-,30
NA,"posals, their interest i n them appears so",30
NA,"small that, with the exception of the hon-",30
NA,orable member for Capricornia ( Mr .,30
NA,"Forde), they have not participated i n the",30
NA,debate or even remained to hear the dis-,30
NA,cussion.,30
Mr FORDE , I t is the duty of the Go-,30

NA,a prominent place on the agenda of the,30

NA,"has been a great deal of agitation, and",30
NA,"there still is, though I admit that i t is",30
NA,"carried on by disappointed people, f o r",30
NA,"the formation of new States, and I trust",30
NA,that something definite w i l l soon be done,30
NA,in the matter.,30
Mr FENTON ,Maribyrnong) [4.23].,30
NA,-Th e honorable member f o r New Eng-,30
NA,"land ( Mr Thompson), and some of his",30
NA,"colleagues, have endeavoured to brand",30
NA,honorable members on this side of the,30
NA,chamber as unificationists. Although I,30
NA,am not afraid of the name I do not con-,30
NA,"sider myself a unificationist, because",30
NA,I would substitute for the present,30
NA,"State Parliaments, provincial Parlia-",30
NA,"ments clothed with limited power, such",30
NA,as operate now i n Canada and South,30
NA,Africa .,30
Mr THOMPSON ,W e do not suggest,30
NA,"that new State Parliaments, with powers",30
NA,such as are possessed by thosenow i n,30
NA,"operation, should be established.",30
Mr FENTON, -I t would be folly i n,30
NA,every sense of the word to enlarge the,30
NA,number of such - parliaments i n - Aus-,30
NA,"tralia. The desire of the Labour party,",30
NA,as I think the overwhelming majorit y of,30
NA,"our people understand, is to substitute",30
NA,for the existing State Parliaments pro-,30
NA,vincial parliaments which w i l l act with-,30
NA,i n the authority conferred upon them by,30
NA,the National Parliament. I am not a,30
NA,unificationist i n the sense that I favour,30
NA,only one Parliament f o r the Common-,30
NA,wealth; but during the twenty years I,30
NA,have been i n public l i f e I have advo-,30
NA,"cated, on both Federal and State plat-",30
NA,"forms, increasing the power of the",30
NA,National Parliament and decreasing that,30
NA,of the State Parliaments. I have said,30
NA,without equivocation that the State Par-,30
NA,"liaments must decrease, and the Common-",30
NA,wealth Parliament increase i n import-,30
NA,ance and power. That view is i n accord,30
NA,"with ""tbe sentiments of the great m a j o r i t y",30
NA,of the Australian people. I t has been,30
NA,said that the Labour party is seeking to,30
NA,"deprive our people bf home rule, but i f",30
NA,we had our way we would give a greater,30
NA,measure of home rule than the people,30
NA,"formed.] now enjoy, f o r we would bring them into",30
NA,closer contact with their governing autho-,30
NA,rities. I object to this piece-meal,30
NA,I method of dealing with the new States,30
NA,issue. This Parliament should consider,30
NA,"the interests, not only of Queensland and",30
NA,"There New South Wales, but of a l l the States.",30
NA,"Western Australia, f o r instance, is just",30
NA,as much entitled to a subdivision of her,30
NA,"territory as New South Wales, Victoria ,",30
NA,or Queensland. I believe i n decentrali-,30
NA,"zation. A few days ago, when I sug-",30
NA,"gested, i n the course of a debate, that",30
NA,"Australia could, w i t h ' benefit to the",30
NA,"people, be divided into twenty provinces,",30
NA,"each with a population of 300,000, the",30
NA,Attorney-General ( Mr Latham) inter-,31
NA,"jected that Sydney itself, would, i n that",31
NA,"case, contain about three provinces. I",31
NA,do not suggest anything like that. I con-,31
NA,sider that capital cities with a com-,31
NA,munity of interests should have pro-,31
NA,vincial parliaments of their own; but I,31
NA,do not think that provincial parliaments,31
NA,in sparsely-populated areas should have as,31
NA,many members as provincial parliaments,31
NA,i n the capital cities. Our Federal system,31
NA,of dividing the Oommonwealth into,31
NA,electoral divisions w i t h a community of,31
NA,"interests, is excellent. I n any new State",31
NA,"subdivisions that I might suggest, I",31
NA,should pay no heed whatever to the,31
NA,present State boundaries. As the people,31
NA,on the borders of Queensland and New,31
NA,"South Wales have similar interests,",31
NA,I should forget the imaginary line,31
NA,"that separates the two States; and, as",31
NA,the people i n the northern part of Vic-,31
NA,"toria and the Riverina,' i n New South",31
NA,"Wales, also have like interests, I sliould",31
NA,pay no attention to the fact that the,31
NA,.Murray River is the present State,31
NA,boundary. I regret that our population,31
NA,"is centred i n our metropolitan areas; but,",31
NA,"i n my opinion, the setting up of provin-",31
NA,cial parliaments such as I have proposed,31
NA,would counteract centralization. I should,31
NA,not think of providing separate governors,31
NA,"and agents-general f o r the new States,",31
NA,nor of setting up two houses of parlia-,31
NA,ment i n them. We shall never secure,31
NA,any real financial reforms u n t il the,31
NA,spheres of Federal and State activity,31
NA,have been substantially altered.,31
Dr EARLE PAGE , I n which direction?,31
Mr FENTON , I should place all,31
NA,our big national services under the,31
NA,trol of the Commonwealth.,31
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Woul d the. honorin,31
NA,able member make the Oommonwealth the,31
NA,controlling authority i n finance?,31
Mr FENTON , Y e s ; I consider,31
NA,would be wise f o r the people to give,31
NA,"Parliament unlimited power, and allow",31
NA,to take over the State debts.,31
NA,Mr THOMT>SOTV -Woul d the honorable,31
NA,member be i n favour of the Commonand,31
NA,wealth Parliament delegating powers,31
NA,the provincial parliaments f r o m time,31
NA,time ?,31
Mr FENTON , I would. I t is most,31
NA,unfortunate that section 128 is i n the,31
NA,Constitution. The concluding paragraph,31
NA,of i t reads-,31
NA,No alteration diminishing the proportionate,31
NA,representation of any State in either House,31
NA,of tlie Parliament or the minimum number of,31
NA,representatives of a State dn the House of,31
NA,"Representatives, or increasing, diminishing, or",31
NA,"otherwise altering the limits of the State, or",31
NA,in any manner affecting the provisions of the,31
NA,"Constitution in relation thereto, shall become",31
NA,law unless the majority of the electors voting,31
NA,in that State approve the proposed law.,31
Mr THOMPSON ,-Tha t spoils our whole,31
NA,Federal system.,31
Mr FENTON , I do not propose to,31
NA,enter into a discussion of the legal aspect,31
NA,"of the matter, but, i n my opinion, the",31
NA,right honorable member f o r N o r t h,31
NA,Sydney ( Mr Hughes) has stated the case,31
NA,correctly.,31
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Wha t we suggest is,31
NA,that both people and Parliament should,31
NA,have the right to take action.,31
Mr FENTON ," A s things are now,",31
NA,although five States in the Commonwealth,31
NA,"determined on an alteration, Tasmania,",31
NA,"our smallest State, could, with a majority",31
NA,"of only two votes, prevent i t f r o m being",31
NA,made; and that is an intolerable position.,31
NA,"From a propaganda point of view, a con-",31
NA,stitutional session might help us i n this,31
NA,matter. I believe that i f I were to con-,31
NA,duct a vigorous campaign i n the Mari -,31
NA,"byrnong electorate, and the main plank",31
NA,"of my platform was unification, my",31
NA,majority would be increased rather than,31
NA,"diminished. I , therefore, have no fear",31
NA,"of being called a unificationist, but i t is",31
NA,not fair to describe the whole of the,31
NA,members of the Labour party as unifi-,31
NA,"cationists, though i t is true that some",31
NA,members of the party propounded a ten-,31
NA,contative scheme for discussion. The honor-,31
NA,able member for Lang ( Sir Ellio t,31
NA,Johnson) said that he does not believe,31
NA,"the creation of new States, because the",31
NA,result would be to impose further bur-,31
NA,dens upon the taxpayers. We might have,31
NA,"i t twenty provincial parliaments, each of",31
NA,this which would have a comparatively small,31
NA,i t area to look after and fewer powers than,31
NA,are now possessed by the State Parlia-,31
NA,ments. Big questions such as the con-,31
NA,"trol of railways, the floating of loans,",31
NA,"so on, could be dealt with in the",31
NA,to Federal arena. The provincial parlia-,31
NA,to ments might be given some of the powers,31
NA,"now possessed by our State Parliaments,",31
NA,"and might, i n addition, be given power",31
NA,to deal w i t h questions which are now,31
NA,dealt with by municipal authorities. By,32
NA,"the adoption of such a system, we should",32
NA,have something like real home rule. The,32
NA,provincial parliaments would not be i n -,32
NA,vested with all the pomp and glory of,32
NA,"our present State Parliaments, but the",32
NA,people they would control would be much,32
NA,better governed than are the people of,32
NA,the States under existing conditions.,32
NA,"This Parliament, freed from its fetters,",32
NA,"could be run on truly national lines, and",32
NA,would be able to do f a r more for the,32
NA,people than i t can do now. We are de-,32
NA,sirous i n this Parliament of doing great -,32
NA,"things for the people, but the Constitu-",32
NA,tion calls a halt whenever we propose,32
NA,to make an advance.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,Th e Constitution can,32
NA,be altered.,32
Mr FENTON ,"Tha t is so, b u t i t is",32
NA,a most difficult matter to alter i t . I hav6,32
NA,often said that i n our Constitution we,32
NA,have too slavishly followed the United,32
NA,"States' Constitution, and would have done",32
NA,better i f we had followed the Canadian,32
NA,Constitution.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,S o f a r as the estab-,32
NA,"lishment of new states is concerned, i t is",32
NA,much worse than the Constitution of the,32
NA,United States of America.,32
Mr FENTON , I t might not be as,32
NA,suitable for the settlement of some ques-,32
NA,"tions, but, speaking generally, we have,",32
NA,"in Australia, followed the Constitution",32
NA,of the United States of America too,32
NA,closely. I remind honorable members of,32
NA,the statement made by General Smuts,32
NA,when the framing of a Constitution fo r,32
NA,South Africa was under consideration.,32
NA,He said .that they had avoided the mis-,32
NA,takes made by the Australian people.,32
NA,They retained for the Federal Parliament,32
NA,f u l l industrial powers over railways and,32
NA,many other activities which the Austra-,32
NA,lian people failed to do. The framers of,32
NA,the South African Constitution were ad-,32
NA,vised to avoid the mistakes we made. I,32
NA,say nothing to the i n j u r y of the memory,32
NA,"of the late Alfred Deakin, or to the repu-",32
NA,NA,32
NA,"that these gentlemen, when members of",32
NA,"the same Government, advised the people",32
NA,charged with the framing of a consti-,32
NA,"tution fo r South Africa , to avoid the",32
NA,mistake made i n Australia of copying too,32
NA,slavishly the Constitution of the United,32
NA,States of America.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,Th e South African,32
NA,provincial experiment has failed.,32
Mr FENTON , I do not know that,32
NA,i t has.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,The y have had half,32
NA,a dozen commissions inquiring into i t .,32
Mr FENTON , W e required a flex-,32
NA,ible constitution which could be altered-,32
NA,and adjusted to meet altered circum-,32
NA,stances ; but we copied a constitution that,32
NA,was 125 years old. We need t o reduce,32
NA,the powers of t h e ' State Parliaments,32
NA,and t o increase the powers of the Federal,32
NA,Parliament. I n the place of our present,32
NA,"State Parliaments, we should have pro-",32
NA,vincial parliaments of one house only.,32
NA,A l l these questions of detail could bo,32
NA,worked out later. I am not satisfied that,32
NA,we should be able to effect the savings,32
NA,that are so necessary. W i t h 20 provincial,32
NA,"parliaments, comprised of 30 members",32
NA,"each, we would have about the same num-",32
NA,ber of members of Parliament that we,32
NA,"have i n Australia to-day, excluding the",32
NA,Federal Parliament.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,Ho w many members,32
NA,should there be i n a provincial parlia-,32
NA,ment ?,32
Mr FENTON , I have put the num-,32
NA,"ber, roughly, at 30.",32
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Ho w many senators,32
NA,should there be?,32
Mr FENTON , T h e honorable gentle-,32
NA,man wants to know how many senators,32
NA,there should be i n the national Parlia-,32
NA,ment. That is a detail which could be,32
NA,carefully considered. I do not say that,32
NA,i t would not be necessary to increase the,32
NA,- membership of the Federal Parliament.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,I s the Labour party,32
NA,in favour of abolishing the Senate?,32
Mr FENTON , Y e s . I see very little,32
NA,use i n the Senate or i n any upper house,32
NA,"i n any country i n the world, beginning",32
NA,with the House of Lords. I f I had my,32
NA,"way, I should abolish the House of Lords.",32
NA,"I t is, i n my mind, iniquitous - that there",32
NA,"should be hereditary peers, and that",32
NA,persons belonging to one section of the,32
NA,Christian church should be entitled to,32
NA,seats i n the House of Lords to the ex-,32
NA,-,32
NA,clusion of -persons belonging to other,32
NA,sections of the church.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,Doe s the Labour,32
NA,party provide i n its new scheme f o r the,32
NA,abolition of tbe Senate?,32
Mr FENTON ," T h e abolition, of the",32
NA,Senate and of a l l upper houses i n Aus-,32
NA,tralia is a part of the Labour party's,32
NA,platform. When our system of govern-,32
NA,ment is brought into greater conformity,32
NA,"with modern ideas, the eyes of the world",32
NA,will be turned upon us mucb less,33
NA,critically than tbey are at tbe present,33
NA,"time. Australia, as at present governed,",33
NA,is the laughing stock of the world.,33
Mr ABBOTT ,On e person in every,33
NA,seven of our population of Australia is a,33
NA,public servant.,33
Mr FENTON,W e are often re-,33
NA,"minded of that, but, so far as the Public",33
NA,"Service is .concerned, the question is",33
NA,whether the members of it are doing their,33
NA,duty and earning their salaries. Some,33
NA,"will complain that, i f the Commonwealth",33
NA,"took over the control of the railways, they",33
NA,would all be controlled from Canberra.,33
NA,That complaint would be made in' every,33
NA,State with the exception of New South,33
NA,"Wales. Already,, in the daily press of",33
NA,"this State, we are being told that the",33
NA,"Federal Parliament is going to Canberra,",33
NA,"that it will be far away, and goodness",33
NA,knows what will happen when everything,33
NA,is run from the Federal Capital. Aus-,33
NA,"tralia is a country of great distances, and",33
NA,yet I would remind honorable members,33
NA,of the wonderful service that is rendered,33
NA,to the people by the Postmaster-General's,33
NA,Department - Its benefits are extended,33
NA,"to every little hamlet in Australia, as well",33
NA,as to. the great cities. Every one will,33
NA,admit the value of the sendees rendered,33
NA,by the Postal Department and the im-,33
NA,portance of tbe work that it is doing for,33
NA,"Australia. I t is, under Federal auspices,",33
NA,doing better work than it did when con-,33
NA,trolled by the several States. Tf the,33
NA,Federal authority can carry out such,33
NA,good work in tho extension of postal,33
NA,"facilities to the people, there is no reason",33
NA,why it should not be able to do equally,33
NA,good work i f it controlled the railways,33
NA,of the Commonwealth in the same way.,33
Mr THOMPSON ,Doe s the honorable,33
NA,"- member believe, that railways in the",33
NA,north-west of Western Australia could be,33
NA,properly manaated from Canberra?,33
Mr FENTON ,The y would not be,33
NA,managed from Canberra. Postal affairs,33
NA,in Western Australia are not managed,33
NA,from Melbourne; they are managed from,33
NA,Perth by the Deputy Director-General,33
NA,for Western Australia. The central ad-,33
NA,"ministration will be at Canberra, but",33
NA,it will be the Deputy Directors who,33
NA,will really administer the affairs of the,33
NA,Postal Department in the various States.,33
NA,"They are doing that work now, and are",33
NA,doing i t well.,33
Mr THOMPSON , Has the Labour,33
NA,party any proposal for an amendment of,33
NA,'the Constitution to bring its scheme into,33
NA,effect?,33
Mr FENTON ,I f the Labour party,33
NA,was in power it would not only propound,33
NA,"a scheme of government for Australia,",33
NA,but it would submit it for consideration,33
NA,either at a special session of the Parlia-,33
NA,"ment or"" to the people by way of referen-",33
NA,dum. The creation of new States is only,33
NA,one matter in connexion with which,33
NA,amendments of the Constitution are re-,33
NA,quired. We pledged ourselves at the 1910,33
NA,election that i f the Labour party were,33
NA,returned it would repeal the Naval Loan,33
NA,Act. That was believed by many people,33
NA,"to be an awful proposal, but we did re-",33
NA,peal it. The Labour party was in power,33
NA,for only a few months when that act was,33
NA,removed from the statute-book; and we,33
NA,made a start with the establishment of,33
NA,an Australian Navy on Australian lines.,33
NA,We said that i f returned to power the,33
NA,people would be given an opportunity to,33
NA,"amend the Constitution, and they were",33
NA,"given such an opportunity in 1911, when",33
NA,proposals for the amendment of the Con-,33
NA,stitution were submitted to them.,33
Mr THOMPSON , The Labour party,33
NA,does not say that it will follow that course,33
NA,in connexion with its new scheme.,33
Mr FENTON ,W e have our own,33
NA,"scheme, and i t will be put forward at",33
NA,the proper time. The Treasurer (Dr,33
NA,Earle Page) and the honorable member,33
NA,for New England have accepted the,33
NA,amendment moved by the honorable mem-,33
NA,ber for Gwydir ( Mr Abbott). There is,33
NA,"no doubt that it will be carried, and the",33
NA,question dealt with by the motion will be,33
NA,remitted to a constitutional session of the,33
NA,Parliament at Canberra. I rose chiefly,33
NA,to refute some statements made by the,33
NA,"honorable member for New England, sug-",33
NA,gesting that the Labour party is in favour,33
NA,of unification. He has said that the,33
NA,Labour party's scheme is a unification,33
NA,scheme.,33
Mr THOMPSON ,Member s of the party,33
NA,have always so described it.,33
Mr FENTON ,Doubtles s there are,33
NA,"rash members in the Labour party, as",33
NA,"well as in the party opposite, who some-",33
NA,times make use of terms without con-,33
NA,sidering their exact meaning. I have,33
NA,"said that, personally, I do not fear to",33
NA,"be called a unificationist, but I do not",33
NA,think the term should be applied to the',34
NA,Labour party as a whole. I have tried to,34
NA,outline the policy of the party to replace,34
NA,the existing State Parliaments by pro-,34
NA,"vincial parliaments, and to establish a",34
NA,federal system of government suited to,34
NA,the circumstances of Australia. A federal,34
NA,system suited to Australia would not be,34
NA,"suited to South A f r i c a , where a different",34
NA,territory and different classes of people,34
NA,require a different f o r m of government.,34
NA,We should suit ourselves to our circum-,34
NA,"stances, and that is why I say we made",34
NA,a big mistake i n copying what was done,34
NA,by people on the other side of the world.,34
Mr THOMPSON ,W e d i d not copy the,34
NA,United States of America.,34
Mr FENTON , I n some directions,34
NA,"we d i d not, but i n other directions we",34
NA,followed the Constitution of the United,34
NA,States nf America too closely. I f . alive,34
NA,'. well I hope to take part i n,34
NA,the proposed constitutional,34
NA,In the meantime I hope the Go-,34
NA,vernment will be fortified by the best,34
NA,legal advice as to what the Con-,34
NA,stitution means. We do not want to,34
NA,put people to the trouble of going to the,34
NA,courts to ascertain what i t means. I,34
NA,hope that whatever alterations are made,34
NA,will be framed i n such clear and unam-,34
NA,biguous language that he who runs may,34
NA,read our law and be able to obey i t . I,34
NA,am prepared to defer the further con-,34
NA,sideration of this question unti l we can,34
NA,"have a constitutional session, and I hope",34
NA,that as a result of the deliberations of,34
NA,that session we shall be i n a position to,34
NA,ask the people to accept some most de-,34
NA,sirable constitutional amendments.,34
Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [ 4 . 5 3 ] - I,34
NA,understand that the honorable member,34
NA,for New England ( Mr Thompson) has,34
NA,agreed to accept the amendment moved,34
NA,by the honorable member for G'wydk,34
NA,( Mr Abbott) that the method of estab-,34
NA,lishing new States should be considered,34
NA,along with other constitutional questions,34
NA,at the proposed constitutional session of,34
NA,this Parliament. I have always been,34
NA,very reasonable on this matter.,34
NA,chief object in. speaking to-day was to,34
NA,prevent the motion from being delayed,34
NA,"for another three weeks, as the Treasurer",34
NA,suggested that i t should be. Although I,34
NA,Was not actually prepared to speak to the,34
NA,"motion, I realized that further delay",34
NA,would be most unfair to the supporters,34
NA,of the New States movement who want,34
NA,some definite pronouncement f r o m the,34
NA,Government on the question. I f my,34
NA,speech did nothing more than pro-,34
NA,voke the Treasurer to state his,34
NA,"attitude on the matter, and what he i n -",34
NA,tends to do to give effect to his election,34
NA,"promises, i t has done some good. I am",34
NA,glad to find that the Treasurer has now,34
NA,announced that the Government will con-,34
NA,sider this question at the constitutional,34
NA,session to be held at Canberra next year.,34
NA,A l l I ask i n that regard is that the Go-,34
NA,vernment shall carry out its promise; be-,34
NA,cause I have i n mind the definite promise,34
NA,made by the Prime Minister i n 1923 that,34
NA,the question would be dealt with at a,34
NA,constitutional session of this Parliament,34
NA,"i n 1924, and nothing was done to",34
NA,carry out that promise. I t is the duty,34
NA,of the honorable member for New Eng-,34
NA,land and others who take an interest,34
NA,i n the New States movement to see that,34
NA,the Government adheres to the promise,34
NA,"session. that i t has made to-day, but I feel sure",34
NA,that i t would not have been made but,34
NA,for my criticism of the Treasurer f o r,34
NA,his apathy and indifference towards a,34
NA,matter which was mainly respon-,34
NA,sible f o r his election to this Parlia-,34
NA,ment. I made.no personal references to,34
NA,the Treasurer. I have absolutely nothing,34
NA,against the honorable member personally.,34
NA,My criticism of him was solely of a poli--,34
NA,"bieal kind, but i t would have been",34
NA,cowardly on my part i f I had said nothing,34
NA,on behalf of a movement i n which I have,34
NA,taken a very keen interest. I disagree,34
NA,in certain respects with a number of sup^,34
NA,porters of the New States movement. For,34
NA,"instance, some of them would establish a'",34
NA,number of additional State parliaments.,34
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e hon-,34
NA,orable member has already spoken to the,34
NA,motion. He must now confine his remarks,34
NA,to the amendment.,34
Mr FORDE , I am dealing with the,34
NA,amendment. I cannot join with those,34
NA,supporters of the New States movement,34
NA,who would create additional State 'par-,34
NA,liaments with upper houses and depart-,34
NA,My ments which would multiply the cost of,34
NA,government i n Australia. I have always,34
NA,held that the Commonwealth should be,34
NA,"the sovereign authority, with a number of",34
NA,subordinate provincial councils or - State,34
NA,parliaments.,34
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e hon-,34
NA,orable member is still going beyond the,34
NA,amendment.,34
Mr FORDE , I recognize that the,35
NA,amendment moved by the honorable,35
NA,member f or Gwydir proposes to defer the,35
NA,question u n t i l the constitutional session is,35
NA,held next year.,35
Mr MATHEWS ,Tha t means nothing.,35
Mr FORDE , I t means that the Go-,35
NA,vernment is not prepared to deal with,35
NA,the matter at the present time. I t s deci-,35
NA,sion will not mest with the approval of,35
NA,the New States League of Central Queens-,35
NA,"land, which has written to me as fol-",35
NA,lows : -,35
NA,"At a meeting of the Executive, held on the",35
NA,"23rd March, I was requested to convey to you",35
NA,the following resolution:-,35
NA,""" That this meeting is against the sug-",35
NA,gestion that the referendum on the matter,35
NA,of amendment of the Federal Constitu-,35
NA,tion to give the Commonwealth Parlia-,35
NA,"ment power .to create new States, should",35
NA,be bracketed with other extraneous mat-,35
NA,"ters, and affirm the fact that the sug-",35
NA,gested amendment of the Constitution in,35
NA,regard to the creation of new States is,35
NA,so important nationally that i t should be,35
NA,submitted to the electors as a single,35
NA,and that the elimination of the State,35
NA,"Government's veto, and the vesting of the",35
NA,"power of creating new States in the Com-,",35
NA,monwealth Parliament he put as briefly,35
NA,"and simply as possible, so that the elec-",35
NA,"tors be not confused.""",35
NA,A copy of that lesolution was sent to,35
NA,the secretary of the Parliamentary New,35
NA,"States Committee, of which the honor-",35
NA,able member for Wew England is secre-,35
NA,tary. The memnors of this league will be,35
NA,disappointed to learn that the Govern-,35
NA,ment will not submit the New States,35
NA,issue at a separate referendum.,35
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Th e honorable .mem-,35
NA,has received my reply to that communica-,35
NA,"tion, stating definitely the Government's",35
NA,attitude.,35
Mr FORDE , I know that I sent the,35
NA,"communication to the Treasurer, and that",35
NA,he furnished me with a reply.,35
NA,"ever, the Government has its majority,",35
NA,and we have now its definite promise,35
NA,that the matter will be dealt with at the,35
NA,constitutional session. I t is not my i n -,35
NA,tention to vote against the amendment.,35
NA,"As a matter of fact, I must accept i t ,",35
NA,because i t is the best we can get under,35
NA,the circumstances. A t the constitutional,35
NA,"session, honorable members of all parties",35
NA,will have ample opportunity to discuss,35
NA,"the Government's proposals, and submit",35
NA,"amendments. I t is a big step forward,",35
NA,for those who desire tbe creation of new,35
NA,"States, to have succeeded i n inducing the",35
NA,Treasurer to announce the Government's,35
NA,"policy, and arouse him out of the state of",35
NA,apathy i n regard to the question into,35
NA,which he has fallen since he took office,35
NA,four and a half years ago. The honorable,35
NA,member for New England has done good,35
NA,work i n trying to induce the Government,35
NA,"to take some action; but i t was, of course,",35
NA,impossible to get the Treasurer to say i n,35
NA,this House what his attitude during the,35
NA,last four and a half years was. When,35
NA,I attacked the Treasurer's political,35
NA,"actions, and his indifference to the New",35
NA,"States movement, he made the lame",35
NA,excuse that I was making a personal at-,35
NA,tack upon him. I attempted no such,35
NA,thing. The Treasurer is responsible to,35
NA,his own electors; but honorable members,35
NA,here are entitled to point to any breach of,35
NA,faith on his part.,35
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Th e hon-,35
NA,orable member is again going beyond,35
NA,the scope of the amendment.,35
Mr FORDE , I am keeping the,35
NA,"issue, amendment i n mind. I have also in mind",35
NA,that a very evasive Treasurer has side-,35
NA,tracked this matter long enough. I pro-,35
NA,pose to see that he lives right up to his,35
NA,election promises i n regard to the New,35
NA,States question.,35
Mr THOMPSON ,New England),35
NA,[5.1] -M y action in submitting my,35
NA,motion twice within the last three years,35
NA,has been f u l l y justified by the discussion,35
NA,we have had upon i t to-day. A t last we,35
NA,have had a definite pronouncement as to,35
NA,the attitude of the Government. W i t h,35
NA,"that attitude, I for the present entirely",35
NA,agree. I have already explained why I,35
NA,"have accepted the amendment, and there",35
NA,is no need for me to go over that ground,35
NA,again. I do not seek to take undue cre-,35
NA,dit for being consistent i n my advocacy,35
NA,of the New States cause i n this Parlia-,35
NA,How- ment. I appreciate the frequent refer-,35
NA,ences of the honorable member for Cap-,35
NA,ricornia to the subject; but T cannot,35
NA,allow this occasion to pass without re-,35
NA,minding the honorable member that he,35
NA,has assiduously avoided taking an active,35
NA,part i n the Parliamentary New States,35
NA,movement. I have no wish to divulge the,35
NA,nature of conversations I have had with,35
NA,"the honorable member, but he has had",35
NA,every opportunity to join the Parliamen-,35
NA,"tary League. He declined very definitely,",35
NA,for the reason that the leaeue was not,35
NA,actually working along the lines in which,35
NA,his party believed. I thought i t was a,35
NA,very reasonable attitude f o r him to take,35
NA,u p; but I am surprised that he did not,36
NA,"stand up to i t i n Capricornia, where the",36
NA,Central Queensland New States move-,36
NA,"ment is fairly active. H a d he done so,",36
NA,I could have admired his consistency,36
NA,more than I do.,36
Mr FORDE , I n January last I called,36
NA,a meeting of the New States League i n,36
NA,"Central Queeusland, aud explained my",36
NA,reasons f o r not joining the Parliamentary,36
NA,Committee. These reasons were published,36
NA,in the issue of the Rockhampton Miner,36
NA,for the 5th January last.,36
Mr THOMPSON , I accept the hon-,36
NA,"orable member's assurance. He is, I",36
NA,"think, sincere i n his advocacy of new",36
NA,States. H e attended two big conventions,36
NA,"at Armidale, and made .speeches that",36
NA,greatly impressed the 300 delegates pre-,36
NA,sent on each occasion. As a personal,36
NA,"friend of the honorable member, I should",36
NA,be sorry to think that he could speak as,36
NA,"he did on those occasions, and at other",36
NA,"conferences, i f he were not sincere.",36
NA,"look forward to active co-operation,",36
NA,"henceforth, w i th h i m i n preparing the",36
NA,case which the New-Staters hope to pre-,36
NA,sent to this Parliament when i t meets,36
NA,for a constitutional session at Canberra,36
NA,next year.,36
Mr FORDE ,Th e trouble is that some,36
NA,of the honorable member's friends im-,36
NA,"port party politics into this movement,",36
NA,to the detriment of the Labour party.,36
Mr THOMPSON ,Som e people may,36
NA,"have done that, but I hope I have never",36
NA,been guilty of such tactics. This is a,36
NA,non-party question. The speech delivered,36
NA,by the honorable member f or M a r i -,36
NA,byrnong ( Mr Fenton) disclosed the need,36
NA,for forcing even the Labour party to,36
NA,submit definite proposals. The honor-,36
NA,able member said that that party has,36
NA,varied the unification scheme originally,36
NA,disclosed i n this House by the honorable,36
NA,"member f o r Dalley ( Mr Mahony), i n",36
NA,"1920. Bearing the title Unification, a",36
NA,"pamphlet has been widely distributed,",36
NA,with the result that a large number of,36
NA,"people regard the "" scheme put forward",36
NA,by the Labour party as a straight-out,36
NA,proposal f o r unification. W i t h the prin-,36
NA,"ciple of that scheme, I have no disagree-",36
NA,"ment, but I think i t is waste of time f o r",36
NA,any party to advocate the abrogation of,36
NA,the Federal compact. The people of,36
NA,Australia accepted federation on the,36
NA,understanding that the Federal principle,36
NA,would be observed. The great weakness,36
NA,"in the scheme of unification, originally",36
NA,"propounded by the Labour party, was",36
NA,that i t definitely abrogated the Federal,36
NA,compact and proposed the substitution of,36
NA,an entirely new system of government.,36
NA,We have been assured to-day by the hon-,36
NA,orable member f o r Maribyrnong and the,36
NA,"honorable member f o r Capricornia that,",36
NA,"at the instigation of Mr Theodore, the",36
NA,Labour party has adopted a modified,36
NA,"scheme, which is not essentially unifica-",36
NA,tion. I f this debate has done nothing,36
NA,"more than disclose that important fact,",36
NA,i t has been well worth while. Although,36
NA,the Labour party is not i n power i n this,36
NA,"Parliament to-day, i t has held office i n",36
NA,"the past, and will probably do so i n the",36
NA,"future. I t is a great party, representing",36
NA,"a large number of people, and i f i t has",36
NA,a proposal that is v i t a l . to the welfare,36
NA,"of Australia, i t should disclose both the",36
NA,principles and the details of i t . The,36
NA,I original scheme did include such details,36
NA,as the granting of constitutions to muni-,36
NA,cipal and shire councils. The sooner the,36
NA,Labour party submits its revised scheme,36
NA,"of subdivision to the people, the better.",36
NA,The agitators i n the New States move-,36
NA,ment may take credit to themselves f o r,36
NA,having forced the Labour party to advo-,36
NA,cate a definite scheme of constitutional,36
NA,reform to permit of the further subdivi-,36
NA,"sion of Australia. As a party, i t has",36
NA,not consistently advocated unification;,36
NA,that has been done spasmodically by i n -,36
NA,"dividual members, but the party appeared",36
NA,to sponsor the scheme. The only means,36
NA,by which the Labour party can bring,36
NA,"its .proposals before the people,",36
NA,is an agitation such as the,36
NA,"New Staters have conducted, which",36
NA,has led to an important declaration by,36
NA,the Commonwealth Government that the,36
NA,claims of the movement w i l l be considered,36
NA,at the constitutional session. The right,36
NA,honorable member f o r N o r t h Sydney,36
NA,( Mr Hughes) dealt i n characteristic,36
NA,"fashion w i th this matter, but, although",36
NA,he has claims to be regarded as a con-,36
NA,"stitutional authority, his declaration thut",36
NA,i t would be impossible to amend section,36
NA,128 did not help us very much.,36
NA,The framers of the Constitution,36
NA,evidently designed that section to,36
NA,prevent the subdivision of a State,36
NA,without the consent of its local legisla-,36
NA,ture. A t the time when the people ac-,36
NA,"cepted that provision, they could have",36
NA,"had no idea of its effect, but after 25",37
NA,"years of federation, we know that it de-",37
NA,finitely prevents the creation of new,37
NA,"States, except in Commonwealth",37
NA,tories. This Parliament has already pro-,37
NA,vided machinery for the establishment of,37
NA,two new States in the Northern,37
NA,"tory, but many years may elapse before",37
NA,the population there is sufficiently,37
NA,to justify the operation of that,37
NA,nery. I do not think the founders of,37
NA,the Commonwealth intended,37
NA,should forever consist of only the six,37
NA,existing States. In Western,37
NA,"Queensland, and New South Wales, where",37
NA,subdivision movements have been fairly,37
NA,"strong at times, the matter has been de-",37
NA,"bated by the State legislatures, but even",37
NA,when they decided to accept the principle,37
NA,of subdivision they always referred,37
NA,scheme back to the Commonwealth,37
NA,"liament. Therefore, unless section 128",37
NA,"is amended, the impossibility of creating",37
NA,new States without the consent of the,37
NA,State Parliaments will continue.,37
NA,25 years of federation not one State,37
NA,Parliament has consented to the estab-,37
NA,lishment of a new State within its boun-,37
NA,daries. The Parliament of New,37
NA,Wales expressed the opinion that,37
NA,"State should be subdivided, but referred",37
NA,the matter to the Commonwealth,37
NA,ment. A royal commission,37
NA,"South Wales, which spent £25,000 in the",37
NA,collecting of evidence and generally in-,37
NA,"vestigating this matter, reported that it",37
NA,was neither practicable nor desirable to,37
NA,create new States within New,37
NA,"Wales. We must, therefore, turn back",37
NA,"to where we started 25 years ago, and",37
NA,ask the people to agree to the deletion of,37
NA,"section 128, or to insert in the Constitu-",37
NA,tion a provision giving to this,37
NA,power to create new States. The longer,37
NA,that step is delayed the more difficult it,37
NA,will become. In all the States the popu-,37
NA,lation in the capital cities is becoming,37
NA,"greater, vested and political",37
NA,"more powerful, and the voice of the rural",37
NA,interests feebler. If we delay,37
NA,action for another twenty years it will,37
NA,be practically impossible to,37
NA,agitate in the rural areas for the Crea-,37
NA,tion of new States. Now is the time to,37
NA,act. The right honorable member,37
NA,North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) said that,37
NA,under the present Constitution,37
NA,sent of the majority of the people voting,37
NA,in the majority of States must be obtained,37
NA,before this Parliament can begin,37
NA,create a new State without the consent,37
NA,Mr Thompson.,37
NA,of the State Parliament concerned. As,37
NA,"an afterthought, he added, that i f",37
NA,any State did not record the necessary,37
NA,Terri- majority of Votes i n favour of the pro-,37
NA,"posal, no subdivision could take place",37
NA,within its boundaries. I f that opinion,37
NA,Terri- is correct the meaning of the Constitu-,37
NA,tion is this: I f a majority in,37
NA,large favour of the creation of new States,37
NA,machi- were obtained i n four of the ex-,37
NA,"isting States, and the majority of",37
NA,that it the people of the Commonwealth were,37
NA,"of the same opinion, subdivision proposals",37
NA,"Australia, could be put into operation i n those four",37
NA,States without the consent of the local,37
NA,"Parliament, but not in the two dissent-",37
NA,ing States. I f five States consented and,37
NA,"Victoria dissented, the five could be sub-",37
NA,"divided, but Victoria could not be. That,",37
NA,"the I know, is the opinion held by the A t -",37
NA,"Par- torney-General ( Mr Latham), but even",37
NA,i f i t is correct i t is not impossible to,37
NA,secure the necessary majority of votes so,37
NA,that this Parliament can subdivide four,37
NA,In the or five of the existing States. I f that,37
NA,step were taken the force of example,37
NA,might operate to induce the dissenting,37
NA,States to surrender the necessary power,37
NA,South to the Commonwealth. I t is not im-,37
NA,that possible for this Parliament to secure a,37
NA,majority in all the six' States i n favour,37
NA,Parlia- of subdivision. I f this matter were re-,37
NA,"in New moved from the arena of party politics,",37
NA,and the two great parties i n this,37
NA,Parliament unitedly asked the people,37
NA,"to amend or repeal section 128,",37
NA,and the other provisions relating to new,37
NA,"South States, and to give to this Parliament",37
NA,absolute power to create new States,37
NA,when and i n such manner as circum-,37
NA,"stances might dictate, the overwhelming",37
NA,majority of the people would assent. But,37
NA,Parliament i f one party goes to the people w i t h a,37
NA,"scheme, and another party advocates a",37
NA,proposal that is the same' in essence but,37
NA,"not i n details, both will be courting de-",37
NA,feat. I hope that between now and the,37
NA,interests constitutional session to be held at Can-,37
NA,"berra, various projects for obtaining",37
NA,taking constitutional authority . to subdivide,37
NA,"Australia will be devised, and that the",37
NA,successfully Labour party will seize the opportunity,37
NA,to spread its so-called unification gospel,37
NA,amongst the people. I t should not con-,37
NA,for tinue to sit down' on the job as i t has,37
NA,been doing during the last four years.,37
NA,the con- I f i t will explain its scheme to the,37
NA,"people, by the time the constitutional",37
NA,session is held a weighty public opinion,37
NA,to in favour of subdivision w i l l have been,37
NA,created. I assure members of the Labour,37
NA,party that the leaders of the New States,38
NA,"movement, who i n the past have bumped,",38
NA,"their heads against brick walls, will rest",38
NA,rio longer. They have explored every,38
NA,constitutional means of getting new,38
NA,States created with the consent of the,38
NA,"State legislatures, but owing to the",38
NA,powerful influence of city interests they,38
NA,"have always failed. I f , however, i t is",38
NA,definitely decided that the Federal Par-,38
NA,"liament shall tackle the question, and",38
NA,that within the next two and a half years,38
NA,the necessary amendments to the Con-,38
NA,stitution will be submitted to the people,38
NA,"as a major issue, there will be no cause",38
NA,for further complaint about the apathy,38
NA,or lethargy of those engaged in the,38
NA,-movement. Of what avail is i t for people,38
NA,to be alert and enthusiastic when thev,38
NA,are continually told that their proposals,38
NA,"are hopeless, that they are up against a",38
NA,constitutional dead-end. and that thev,38
NA,had better accept things as they are?,38
NA,When they see that there is a chance of,38
NA,achieving something they will continue,38
NA,the fight with renewed zest. When they,38
NA,were led to believe that if they agitated,38
NA,they would be able to swing the State,38
NA,"Parliaments behind their movement, thev",38
NA,"were f u l l of life and hope, and thev",38
NA,worked to such good purpose that,38
NA,for two or three years the creation,38
NA,of new States was the most widely,38
NA,discussed question in Australian politics.,38
NA,But when they found that their efforts,38
NA,"were .useless, and that they always came",38
NA,back to the dead end of section 128 of the,38
NA,"Constitution, they decided that, unti l",38
NA,"Parliament would take the cause in hand,",38
NA,they would not waste more of their time,38
NA,"and substance on i t . They subsided, and",38
NA,left the job to be done by the politicians.,38
NA,I happen to be one of the politicians to,38
NA,whom the job was left. One honorable,38
NA,member has said that I have pursued the,38
NA,subject to distraction in this House. I,38
NA,have consistently tried to bring i t uncier,38
NA,"tbe notice of this Parliament, and I hope",38
NA,"that i t will be evident, in a few minutes,",38
NA,that I have done so with success. I hope,38
NA,that the Government will not. regard the,38
NA,carrying of this amendment as the shelv-,38
NA,"ing jof the question', but rather as. a",38
NA,definite instrnr-tion from this Parliament,38
NA,that i t should set its constitutional,38
NA,authorities to work to t r y to devise,38
NA,suggestions to place before the people.,38
NA,"Those suggestions should be made, not",38
NA,two or three weeks before the constitu-,38
NA,"tutional session, but as soon as possible, so",38
NA,that thoy may be considered and,38
NA,thoroughly discussed by the people.,38
Mr FORDE , I wish to make a per-,38
NA,sonal explanation. The honorable mem-,38
NA,ber f o r New England ( Mr Thompson),38
NA,said that he sympathized with me f o r not,38
NA,joining the Parliamentary New States,38
NA,"Committee, but that I had been inconsis-",38
NA,tent i n not going to Central Queensland,38
NA,and telling the electors there why I would,38
NA,not join the committee. He is not correct,38
NA,"in saying that I was inconsistent, f o r I",38
NA,wrote to the Central Queensland New,38
NA,"States League, and told i t that I was not",38
NA,prepared to join the parliamentary com-,38
NA,"mittee, and asked i t to"" convene a meeting",38
NA,"on the subject. That meeting, was held on",38
NA,"the 4th January, and I attended and",38
NA,clearly gave my reasons fo r not joining,38
NA,the committee. I have an extract f r o m,38
NA,"a newspaper report, of the meeting, at",38
NA,which I definitely stated that I considered,38
NA,"that the Government, which had a follow-",38
NA,ing comprising a majority of members of,38
NA,"the Parliament, should submit its policy.",38
NA,I told them that the members of the,38
NA,"Labour party, although they were not",38
NA,"prepared to join the committee, would",38
NA,"give the question f u l l consideration, but",38
NA,would not consent to be dragged at the,38

NA,MT . MACKAY (Lilley) [5.25] -Th e,39
NA,motion of the honorable member f o r,39
NA,Macquarie ( Mr Manning) refers to an,39
NA,important railway proposal which is un-,39
NA,"doubtedly necessary f o r the development,",39
NA,not only of a portion of the Northern,39
NA,"Territory, but also of a very large area",39
NA,i n Queensland. As the Commonwealth,39
NA,Parliament has already decided on the,39
NA,"construction of the north-south line,",39
NA,which w i l l connect. Darwin with Port,39
NA,"Augusta, the motion should not excite",39
NA,suspicion i n the minds of those honorable,39
NA,members who represent South Australian,39
NA,constituencies. There is undoubtedly,39
NA,room f o r anumber of railways i n the,39
NA,"Northern Territory, and this proposal",39
NA,meets requirements only i n one direction.,39
NA,I regret that the honorable member f o r,39
NA,Swan moved an amendment. to the,39
NA,"motion. He did not, however, oppose",39
NA,"the motion, but said that he thought",39
NA,the construction of the line proposed i n,39
NA,his amendment should be the first step,39
NA,in railway construction after the construc-,39
NA,of the north-south line. I f his amend-,39
NA,"ment had been a separate motion, i t would",39
NA,undoubtedly have had the support of the,39
NA,majority of honorable members. There,39
NA,can be no doubt that the Northern Ter-,39
NA,ritory i n the future will need a number,39
NA,"of railways, and as the suggestion of the",39
NA,honorable member for Swan is that a,39
NA,"railway should be built to the West, and",39
NA,tho suggestion of the honorable member,39
NA,for Macquarie is that one should be built,39
NA,"to the east, the two proposals are not i n",39
NA,conflict. The honorable member for Mac-,39
NA,quarie dealt exhaustively with the pastoral,39
NA,"possibilities of the Barkly Tablelands, and",39
NA,generally his speech corroborated the,39
NA,statements of many persons who have,39
NA,personal knowledge of that portion of the,39
NA,Territory. I wish to quote one or two,39
NA,authorities who have not been mentioned,39
NA,in the debate. Last year the Common-,39
NA,wealth Government asked Sir George,39
NA,"Buchanan, K . C . I . E . , an eminent engi-",39
NA,"neer, to express his opinion on certain",39
NA,developmental problems i n the Northern,39
NA,"Territory, and i n his report, which has",39
NA,"been issued as a parliamentary paper, he",39
NA,"said, "" I feel satisfied that the develop-",39
NA,ment of the Northern Territory must,39
NA,"begin through Queensland, and, i n the",39
NA,"first instance, by an extension of the",39
NA,"pastoral industry."" A f t e r referring to",39
NA,a report of the Parliamentary Standing,39
NA,"Committee on Public Works, which i n -",39
NA,quired very closely into the question of,39
NA,railway construction in the Northern,39
NA,"Territory, he said : -",39
NA,I believe that tlie interests of the country,39
NA,"would be best served by building, as soon as",39
NA,"possible, the railway to Camooweal, and I",39
NA,suggest construction should take place simil-,39
NA,"taneously from Camooweal North, and from",39
NA,"Emungalan South, and that the Queensland",39
NA,Government should be urged to construct at,39
NA,"once, the line from Cloncurry to Camooweal,",39
NA,thus bringing tho Queensland railway system,39
NA,to the frontier of the Nortliern Territory.,39
NA,"Mr Bell, the Commonwealth Commis-",39
NA,"sioner of Railways, i n giving evidence",39
NA,"before the committee, said: -",39
NA,The Bourke-Camooweal connexion would be,39
NA,"of immense advantage to Australia, and must",39
NA,be built eventually. The Queensland portion,39
NA,of tho route was approved by the Queensland,39
NA,Parliament fifteen years ago. The route would,39
NA,give the Northern Territory tho advantage of,39
NA,direGt access to the tremendously big Sydney,39
NA,market.,39
NA,A glance at the map of Australia shows,39
NA,that Queensland can justly claim to have,39
NA,the best planned system of railways i n,39
NA,the Commonwealth. I u the matter of,39
NA,"accidents, i t has a record that compares",39
NA,favorably with that of any other railway,39
NA,"system. I n that State there are 6,147",39
NA,miles of government railways open for,39
NA,"traffic, and they have been built at a",39
NA,"capital cost of £52,000,000. There is a",39
NA,railway from the port of Townsville run-,39
NA,"ning due west via Cloncurry to Dajarra,",39
NA,"which is 120 miles f r o m Camooweal, and",39
NA,on the border of the Territory. That,39
NA,line is 640 miles i n length. The line pro-,39
NA,posed by the honorable member for,39
NA,Macquarie across the Tablelands could be,39
NA,"connected at Dajarra or Cloncurry,",39
NA,and direct communication could thus,39
NA,be provided with the seaboard at,39
NA,Townsville. We have a useful line run-,39
NA,ning from Rockhampton due west to,39
NA,"Yaraka, through the rich central districts",39
NA,"of Queensland, a distance of 475 miles.",39
NA,"I n addition, there is the Brisbane",39
NA,"to Quilpie line of 624 miles, and quite",39
NA,"recently the coastal line of 1,042 miles",39
NA,has been completed connecting Brisbane,39
NA,with Cairns i n the f a r north. Great,39
NA,credit is due to the past statesni&j of,39
NA,"Queensland, who looked into the future",39
NA,before planning the railway system of that,39
NA,State. Their foresight has undoubtedly,39
NA,led to the establishment of large centres,39
NA,"of population outside the capital city, and",39
NA,there is no 'doubt that the motion offers,39
NA,a splendid opportunity for further deve-,40
NA,loping the back country of Queensland.,40
NA,The Queensland Parliament has already,40
NA,given its approval to a proposal for a,40
NA,"railway line from Camooweal, to-",40
NA,connect up all the rail heads I,40
NA,"have mentioned with Tobermory, which",40
NA,is within 250 miles of Hungerford,40
NA,"on the border of New South Wales,",40
NA,and that would establish connexion with,40
NA,"Bourke and Sydney. I n my opinion,",40
NA,this railway could be quickly and econo-,40
NA,"mically constructed, because there are",40
NA,four existing railheads adjacent to the,40
NA,suffffested route. N o difficulty need be,40
NA,anticipated i n the Commonwealth and,40
NA,State Governments reaching an agree-,40
NA,ment on the matter; and development,40
NA,would occur that would undoubtedly lead,40
NA,to the settlement of a big population.,40
NA,Quenseland does not expect,40
NA,Commonwealth Government to provide,40
NA,tbe whole construction cost; a l l she de-,40
NA,"sires is that the matter shall be dealt,",40
NA,with on a business basis.,40
NA,parties that would benefit by the con-,40
NA,struction of the line should contribute to,40
NA,"its cost, and the Commonwealth would",40
NA,"undoubtedly benefit, f or the railway would",40
NA,tap the valuable Barkly Tableland. I,40
NA,"should like part of the £34,000,000 that",40
NA,Great Britain has offered to the Common-,40
NA,wealth and States allocated to the build-,40
NA,"ing of this railway, as i t would provide",40
NA,"employment for immigrants, and would",40
NA,absorb all the unemployed i n the Com-,40
NA,"monwealth, as' well as a large number",40
NA,of migrants f r o m overseas.,40
Mr MANNING , I t is essentially a de-,40
NA,"velopmental line, and would come within",40
NA,the terms of the agreement.,40
Mr MACKAY , T h a t is my opinion.,40
NA,The history of railway construction indi-,40
NA,cates that a proportion of the men en-,40
NA,gaged on work like this select a piece of,40
NA,land near the railway when i t is com-,40
NA,pleted and settle there; and undoubtedly,40
NA,some of the immigrants would be glad to,40
NA,get such excellent country. Many people,40
NA,shudder at our Commonwealth and State,40
NA,public debt of £160 per head of the popu-,40
NA,lation; but i t must be remembered that,40
NA,we have tens of thousands of miles of,40
NA,"railways, harbour improvements, roads",40
NA,"and - bridges, and many other valuable",40
NA,permanent works to set against i t .,40
Mr FOSTER ,Wil l the honorable mem-,40
NA,ber tell us the total loss on the working,40
NA,of our railways i n the last ten years?,40
NA,1,40
NA,3505,40
Mr MACKAY , I have not the,40
NA,figures by'me . The honorable member,40
NA,for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) is inclined,40
NA,to forget that Australia is just emerging,40
NA,f r o m the pioneering stage of her develop-,40
NA,ment. Future generations w i l l marvel at,40
NA,the manner i n which we have sur-,40
NA,mounted our difficulties. I n my,40
NA,"opinion, there is no reason whatever",40
NA,for pessimism. Wc must build railways,40
NA,"to develop our country. I t is foolish, i n",40
NA,"my. opinion, to expect people to settle on",40
NA,areas that lie f r o m 100 to 150 miles away,40
NA,from a railway line. We should make,40
NA,"our railways first, and then send settlers",40
NA,forward to undertake developmental,40
NA,enterprises. We should not hesitate to,40
NA,borrow money to build developmental,40
NA,railways into good country. I trust that,40
NA,the honorable member f o r Swan ( Mr .,40
NA,the Greeory) w i l l withdraw his amendment,40
NA,and give us the opportunity to record a,40
NA,"straight-out vote on the motion. I f , later,",40
NA,he saw fit to introduce his amendment i n,40
NA,A l l the,40
NA,"the f o r m of a motion, I am sure that",40
NA,practically every honorable member would,40
NA,support i t .,40
Dr NOTT ,Herbert) [ 5 . 4 3 ] - I sup-,40
NA,port the motion. Certain interjections,40
NA,that were hurled at the honorable mem-,40
NA,ber f o r Macquarie ( Mr Manning) when,40
NA,"he introduced i t , notably those by the",40
NA,NA,40
NA,"sons), indicate that there is a feeling on",40
NA,the part of some honorable members that,40
NA,the building of this line would sound the,40
NA,"death-knell of the north-south line, or at",40
NA,least delay the building of i t f o r many,40
NA,"years. I disagree with that view, and",40
NA,remind honorable members who subscribe,40
NA,to i t that we who favour this motion also,40
NA,support the building of the north-south,40
NA,line. We believe that the Commonwealth,40
NA,Government should honour its undertak-,40
NA,ing with the South Australian people;,40
NA,but even then this line will be necessary.,40
NA,As a matter of fact they are two entirely,40
NA,different propositions. The Northern,40
NA,"Territory, i n my opinion, will never be",40
NA,successfully developed by settlers who,40
NA,go to i t direct from our capital cities.,40
NA,Before they can hope to succeed they,40
NA,must have some knowledge of the condi-,40
NA,tions that prevail there. I support this,40
NA,"motion, for I believe that i t will cause",40
NA,settlers of the right type to gravitate to,40
NA,"the Northern Territory, and later",40
NA,to take up land i n i t . Many of the big,40
NA,holdings in the Territory that will revert,41
NA,to the Crown shortly will be subdivided,41
NA,"for closer settlement, and i t is highly",41
NA,necessary that there should be some,41
NA,"setters with suitable experience, ready to",41
NA,take up the smaller holdings. I t has,41
NA,"been suggested also, by interjection, that",41
NA,the Queensland Government should bear,41
NA,the f u l l cost of constructing this line. I,41
NA,disagree with that view. New South,41
NA,Wales will benefit at least as much as,41
NA,"Queensland by the building, of the line,",41
NA,and should bear part of the cost of i t .,41
NA,Another justification for building the line,41
NA,is that i t will pass through country that,41
NA,is generally and rightly regarded as the,41
NA,stock uursery of Australia. U n t i l com-,41
NA,"paratively recently there were 17,000,000",41
NA,"sheep in Queensland, but the calamitous",41
NA,drought that has prevailed i n the,41
NA,last twelve months has caused,41
NA,"6,000,000 of them to die. The physical",41
NA,features of Queensland are such that i t,41
NA,rarely happens that the whole State is,41
NA,drought-stricken at the same time.,41
NA,tbis line had been operating in the last,41
NA,twelve months i t would have been possible,41
NA,to transport practically all the sheep that,41
NA,have died to areas where there was,41
NA,"plenty of feed and water, and so to",41
NA,have saved them. The district that I,41
NA,"represent, for instance, from Mackay to",41
NA,"Thursday Island, is a smiling gar-",41
NA,"den with an abundant water supply, and",41
NA,i t would bave been of tremendous ad-,41
NA,vantage to us if we could have transported,41
NA,"those 6,000,000 sheep into some of the",41
NA,luxuriant country that is available there;,41
NA,"but, as it is, the nation has suffered a",41
NA,loss the extent of which i t is almost im-,41
NA,possible to compute.,41
Mr MANNING ,I f only some of,41
NA,"the 6,000,000 sheep had been transhipped",41
NA,the remainder would have had more,41
NA,country.,41
Dr NOTT ,Tha t is so. The best that,41
NA,could be done under existing conditions,41
NA,was to send away as many as possible of,41
NA,the stud ewes and rams. The wethers,41
NA,were left to their fate and practically all,41
NA,of them died. That will adversely affect the,41
NA,prosperity of Queensland for many years.,41
NA,Many pastoralists and graziers are ex-,41
NA,periencing the greatest difficulty i n arti-,41
NA,ficially feeding cattle and sheep. Some,41
NA,"are expending as much as £2,000 per",41
NA,week in importing maize to keep alive,41
NA,the remnants of what were at one time,41
NA,magnificent herds and flocks. Were such,41
NA,a railway as is proposed i n the motion,41
NA,constructed by the State and Common-,41
NA,"wealth Governments i n co-operation, the",41
NA,expenditure involved i n its construction,41
NA,would be recouped i n ' the first three,41
NA,months of any drought that might occur,41
NA,i n the future. There is an economic as-,41
NA,pect of the proposed railway construc-,41
NA,tion i n the effect i t would have,41
NA,upon our beef industry - There are being,41
NA,grazed i n the vicinity of the route of the,41
NA,"proposed railway, half the cattle i n",41
NA,"Queensland, and Queensland produces",41
NA,half the cattle reared i n Australia.,41
NA,"Our surplus of cattle is roughly ""800,000.",41
NA,"Twenty per cent, of the number are used",41
NA,for export under conditions that show no,41
NA,profit to the grower. About half the,41
NA,number are taken over the borders into,41
NA,"the southern States, and used as store",41
NA,"cattle, and f or consumption i n those",41
NA,States. The country through which the,41
NA,proposed line would go is the actual,41
NA,"If breeding ground of most of these cattle,",41
NA,and i f facilities were provided f or their,41
NA,"transport to the coastal areas, i n times of",41
NA,emergency they could be treated i n a,41
NA,"satisfactory manner, and at a profit to",41
NA,the growers. Queensland is the only,41
NA,State that is still engaged in the beef,41
NA,"export trade, and f or the simple reason",41
NA,that she cannot get out of i t . Costs of,41
NA,production and wages are high. The,41
NA,"factories must be very large, for the rea-",41
NA,son that the killing and preserving of,41
NA,beef is a seasonal industry. Enormous,41
NA,numbers of cattle have to be passed,41
NA,through the meat works during a short,41
NA,"season, and, consequently, wages in the",41
NA,industry are very high. Cattle having to,41
NA,"travel long journeys on the hoof, must",41
NA,often be put through the factories in a,41
NA,condition which does not reflect credit,41
NA,on the output of the industry. Anomalous,41
NA,conditions existing at present in the,41
NA,"southern portions of Australia might be,",41
NA,"to a great extent, overcome by the con-",41
NA,struction of such a railway as the honor-,41
NA,able member f o r Macquarie has proposed.,41
NA,As the average price which Queensland,41
NA,producers get f o r their beef at the,41
NA,slaughteryards or meat works is about,41
NA,"17s. per 100 lb. at the meat works, and",41
NA,"45s. f o r beef brought 9,000 miles,",41
NA,we can easily understand why there is,41
NA,"no profit i n the industry, and why Mr .",41
NA,"Hardacre, who is now a memb<sr",41
NA,"of the Land Court i n Queensland,",41
NA,and was at one time Minister f o r,42
NA,Agriculture in a Labour,42
NA,"ment, stated recently that i f existing con-",42
NA,ditions continued the pastoral industry,42
NA,would shortly be a thing of the past. The',42
NA,price of 17s. per 100 lb. of beef at the,42
NA,slaughteryards and meatworks practi-,42
NA,cally fixes the price of cattle f o r the,42
NA,whole of northern Queensland.,42
NA,producers i n Queensland receive only,42
NA,"17s. per 100 l b . for their cattle,",42
NA,cattle are sold i n the southern markets,42
NA,at the extraordinary price of 65s. per,42
NA,100 lb. Only the other day I noticed the,42
NA,"sale, i n this, southern market, of a four-",42
NA,"months o l d l f e i f e r f o r £7, which is prac-",42
NA,tically the price that would be paid f o i,42
NA,two cows i n Queensland.,42
Mr FENTON ,Bullock s are sold here,42
NA,f o r £24 a head.,42
Dr NOTT , I noticed that at recent,42
NA,sales here 40 f a t cows averaged £25 per,42
NA,"head, whereas £4 10s. is a f a i r price i n",42
NA,Queensland f o r a f a t bullock. No one by,42
NA,any stretch of the imagination can sug-,42
NA,gest that one Victorian cow is worth four,42
NA,f a t ' Queensland bullocks. Because of,42
NA,their inabilit y to get to the southern,42
NA,markets Queensland pastoralists,42
NA,suffering very severe losses.,42
Mr FORDE ,Thei r losses are not due,42
NA,to their having to pay high wages.,42
Dr NOTT , N o ; but the fact that,42
NA,high wages have to be paid to men en-,42
NA,gaged i n a seasonal occupation at the,42
NA,slaughter-yards and meatworks contri-,42
NA,butes to the unsatisfactory condition of,42
NA,the beef industry. Queensland producers,42
NA,may not be envious of the price paid for,42
NA,"beef i n Victoria, but they are not satis-",42
NA,fied with the conditions that exist i n,42
NA,their own State. I f a railway were con-,42
NA,structed by the route suggested by the,42
NA,"honorable member for Macquarie, i t",42
NA,would link up the western portion of,42
NA,Queensland with the coast i n such a way,42
NA,that a continuous supply of cattle would,42
NA,be available for the meatworks. Towns-,42
NA,ville could then be made a slaughtering,42
NA,depot for the supply to southern con-,42
NA,"sumers, not of frozen beef, but of chilled",42
NA,beef. This would greatly benefit the,42
NA,"cattle industry of Australia, as well as",42
NA,consumers of beef i n Victoria.,42
NA,tralia should have an enormous meat ex-,42
NA,"port trade, but those engaged i n the pas-",42
NA,toral industry have been up against the,42
NA,wall for a very considerable time.,42
NA,Various methods have been suggested to,42
NA,overcome their difficulties. A n Advisory,42
NA,"Meat Council was brought into being,",42
NA,Govern- but its establishment was followed by,42
NA,"little or no success, though i t was able to",42
NA,secure some concessions i n freight ' and,42
NA,other charges. So long as the council,42
NA,continues i n the effort to open up a,42
NA,foreign market i n Great Britain and,42
NA,"Europe, thebeef industry must remain",42
NA,Whilst in the pitiable position i t is i n to-day.,42
NA,The natural market for the Australian,42
NA,beef industry is first the Australian,42
NA,"market, and subsequently the eastern",42
NA,market. We have not so far been very,42
NA,"successful in reaching the eastern market,",42
NA,but persistence will eventually secure,42
NA,that market f or Australian meat. I f we,42
NA,carried out railway construction which,42
NA,would enable continuous supplies of cattle,42
NA,to be taken from the interior to the coast,42
NA,"for fattening purposes, the enormous",42
NA,size of our slaughter-houses and meat-,42
NA,"works might be reduced, and with con-",42
NA,tinuous operations throughout a lengthy,42
NA,season i t should be possible to establish,42
NA,at Townsville a second Chicago. With,42
NA,scientific advice as to the best methods of,42
NA,"freezing and chilling beef, there is no",42
NA,reason why we should not be able to cap-,42
NA,ture the whole of the eastern trade. The,42
NA,are British market has been captured by the,42
NA,people of Argentina because they are i n,42
NA,a position to slaughter their cattle con-,42
NA,tinuously. The cattle are brought from,42
NA,"the interior to the coastal areas, where",42
NA,they are fattened i n alfalfa or lucerne,42
NA,"paddocks, and can be slaughtered when",42
NA,in fine condition. Those engaged i n the,42
NA,meat exporting industry i n Argentina,42
NA,"are able to chill their beef, whilst we are",42
NA,compelled to freeze ours. One of the,42
NA,' subjects which could be taken up suc-,42
NA,cessfully by the' Council of Scientific,42
NA,and Industrial Research is the scien-,42
NA,tific freezing of beef - Fat cattle freeze,42
NA,better killed at one age than i f,42
NA,killed at another age. Meat that,42
NA,freezes quickly is i n better condition,42
NA,when thawed than meat that is frozen,42
NA,slowly. These are .all questions pertinent,42
NA,"to the motion, and 1 hope that at no",42
NA,distant date the Commonwealth Govern-,42
NA,"ment, i n co-operation with the Queens-",42
NA,"land Government, wil l carry out a rail-",42
NA,way system which wil l enable a con-,42
NA,tinuous supply of cattle to be available,42
NA,Aus- to our meatworks.,42
Mr RODGERS ,Whils t the honorable,42
NA,member's argument is sound a's affecting,42
NA,"the home market, i t would not solve the",42
NA,difficulty w i t h regard to the export,42
NA,market.,42
Dr NOTT , I t would solve i t i n so far,43
NA,as a continuous supply of cattle to a,43
NA,"centre like Townsville, where shipping is",43
NA,"available, would lead to specialization i n",43
NA,"the beef industry on scientific principles,",43
NA,which should result i n the production of,43
NA,a better article than is produced at the,43
NA,present time.,43
Mr RODGERS ,Ou r export margin is,43
NA,too small at present.,43
Dr NOTT ," I t is small, and i t w i l l ,",43
NA,"unfortunately, continue to",43
NA,smaller unless we can scientifically solve,43
NA,the question of freezing our beef i n such,43
NA,"a way tbat, to the discriminating palates",43
NA,"of people i n Europe, i t will compare with",43
NA,the chilled meat obtained from Argen-,43
NA,tina or locally-killed beef. I n my opinion,43
NA,tbe honorable member for Macquarie was,43
NA,wise in refraining from laying down a,43
NA,definite route i n his motion for the rail-,43
NA,way construction he proposes. The route,43
NA,to be followed is a matter to be l e f t to,43
NA,experts. When the bill for the north-,43
NA,south railway was under discussion i n,43
NA,"this House, a good deal of time was spent,",43
NA,"and a great deal of heat engendered,",43
NA,during the debate because different mem-,43
NA,bers advocated the adoption of different,43
NA,"routes, and endeavoured to support their",43
NA,views by the fact that half a point more,43
NA,or less of rain fell on the east or west,43
NA,of a particular route. The route of the,43
NA,line might very well be lef t to inquiry,43
NA,"by the Public Works Committee, and",43
NA,local residents of particular areas could,43
NA,advance the special claims of those areas.,43
NA,I do not think the time has arrived when,43
NA,we should be warranted in adopting the,43
NA,amendment moved by the honorable mem-,43
NA,ber for Swan ( Mr Gregorv). The hon-,43
NA,"orable member is, no doubt, anticipating",43
NA,what will in the future become an ac-,43
NA,complished fact. He referred to the po-,43
NA,tentialities for agriculture and grazing of,43
NA,the country along the route that he has,43
NA,suggested for tbe construction of a rail-,43
NA,way. I am willing to agree with him as,43
NA,to the fertility of the region which he,43
NA,thinks ought to be opened u p ; but up,43
NA,to tbe present i t is practically virgin,43
NA,"country, there are no large herds of",43
NA,"cattle or flocks of sheep there, and settle-",43
NA,ment in the region is not far advanced.,43
Mr GREGORY ,I n the Wave H i l l dis-,43
NA,trict there is a considerable area of good,43
NA,cattle country.,43
Dr NOTT , B u t I understood the,43
NA,honorable member to say that although,43
NA,there was a great futur e f o r the district,43
NA,he proposed to serve by means of the,43
NA,"railway he suggests, there are not very",43
NA,many herds there now. There is not the,43
NA,slightest doubt that that portion of Aus-,43
NA,tralia w i l l ultimately be served by a rail-,43
NA,"way, and I should be favorably disposed",43
NA,towards a proposal to build a road,43
NA,through i t as a foundation upou which,43
NA,subsequently a railway could be laid.,43
NA,"Personally, I think that a road built at",43
NA,"a cost of about £2,000 a mile would ad-",43
NA,become mirably suit the requirements of the,43
NA,"Northern Territory, but we are obliged to",43
NA,"honour an obligation to build a railway,",43
NA,"and, apparently, i t -is the cjgsire of Par-",43
NA,liament that such a line shall be built.,43
NA,A railway is evidently the solution of,43
NA,he problem of transport i n the Northern,43
NA,"Territory, but I suggest that the",43
NA,honorable member for Swan should,43
NA,"withdraw his proposal f o r a railway, and",43
NA,substitute f o r i t a proposal for the con-,43
NA,struction of a good road i n that part of,43
NA,northern Australia he wishes to provide,43
NA,with transport facilities. I understand that,43
NA,i t is the practice f o r many private mo-,43
NA,"tions to become hardy annuals, or almost",43
NA,"perennials, but I hope that w i l l not be",43
NA,the case with this motion. There are,43
NA,many reasons why the construction of a,43
NA,railway f r o m Bourke to the Northern,43
NA,Territory is an urgent matter. When,43
NA,"built, such a line will prove a great factor",43
NA,in the successful development of the,43
NA,fringes of Queensland and New South,43
NA,"Wales, as well as the Northern Territory;",43
NA,i t w i l l afford enormous relief to the pas-,43
NA,"toralists and graziers along its route, and",43
NA,i t w i l l mean an enormous saving to Aus-,43
NA,"tralia, through the prevention of losses",43
NA,"f r o m droughts. I hope, therefore, that",43
NA,the motion w i l l not need to be put on the,43
NA,"business-paper again, and that the Go-",43
NA,vernment will regard its adoption to-day,43
NA,as an instruction f r o m Parliament that,43
NA,i t should take the necessary steps to,43
NA,approach the States concerned in the,43
NA,construction of the railway. I t gives me,43
NA,no little pleasure to support whole-,43
NA,heartedly the motion submitted by the,43
NA,honorable member for Macquarie.,43
Mr FORDE ,Capricornia) [ 6 . 9 ] - I,43
NA,am pleased to give my support to the,43
NA,motion submitted by the honorable mem-,43
NA,ber for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) for the,43
NA,building of a railway from Bourke i n,43
NA,"New South Wales, through Central",43
NA,"Queensland towards Cloncurry, and",43
NA,"across the Barkly Tablelands, to a point",43
NA,on the North-South Railway i n the Nor-,44
NA,thern Territory. The pastoral areas be-,44
NA,tween Bourke and Camooweal are among,44
NA,the best in Australia. The country,44
NA,through which the line would pass pre-,44
NA,"sents no engineering difficulties, and the",44
NA,"railway should be a sound, economic, and",44
NA,commercial proposition. I think i t is the,44
NA,duty of the Commonwealth Government,44
NA,to take the initial steps towards having i t,44
NA,built. I t is difficul t to induce State,44
NA,"Governments, with naturally . circum-",44
NA,"scribed views on such questions, to visua-",44
NA,lize a great project from an Australian,44
NA,"perspective. Therefore, as the Federal Go-",44
NA,vernment took the first step towards the,44
NA,unification of the railway gauges of Aus-,44
NA,"tralia, and as the first link from Kyogle",44
NA,to Brisbaneis being constructed tbe,44
NA,Government should also take into,44
NA,serious consideration the building of,44
NA,the railway proposed by the,44
NA,orable member for Macquarie.,44
NA,"fortunately,- many motions standing i n",44
NA,the names of private members are passed,44
NA,over and forgotten; but now that the,44
NA,Minister for Works and Railways ( Mr .,44
NA,H i l l ) is in the chamber listening to what,44
NA,"is said, possibly be will take up to the",44
NA,matter witb the seriousness that i t de-,44
NA,"serves. From a defence point of view, the",44
NA,railway would be of great importance to,44
NA,Australia.,44
Mr GREGORY ,Buildin g the railway,44
NA,as suggested i n 'my amendment would,44
NA,bring about more settlement i n the,44
NA,north.,44
Mr FORDE ,Th e railway suggested,44
NA,by the honorable member for Macquarie,44
NA,would be a commercial and economic,44
NA,proposition. I t would be a wonderful,44
NA,asset to Australia as a means of develop-,44
NA,ing the continent. We all recognize,44
NA,"that i t is ""the duty of the Commonwealth",44
NA,"to build the north-south railway, and",44
NA,Parliament has decided to build that line;,44
NA,but tbe proposal of the honorable mem-,44
NA,ber for Macquarie is an additional,44
NA,proposition which the Commonwealth,44
NA,should take i n hand with,44
NA,intention to push i t through to com-,44
NA,pletion. I t will be a long,44
NA,"costing a great deal of money, but I think",44
NA,that the Commonwealth as a whole will,44
NA,be recouped its expenditure several times,44
NA,over i n the first twenty years.,44
NA,is estimated that every four years,44
NA,"in the area, to be served by this rail-",44
NA,"way, the pastoralists lose, approximately",44
NA,"20,000,000 sheep. I n a good season a",44
NA,"sheep is worth from £ 1 to 27s. 6d., but",44
NA,at times the price paid i n Queensland is,44
NA,as high as 30s. Taking 30s. as the value,44
NA,"of a sheep, the loss of 20,000,000 sheep",44
NA,"every four years means, approximately, a",44
NA,"loss to Australia of £30,000,000. There",44
NA,are at present along the route within a,44
NA,"reasonable distance of the proposed line,",44
NA,and i n an area that would be bene-,44
NA,"fited thereby, about 4,000,000 head of",44
NA,"cattle and 10,000,000 sheep. During the",44
NA,recent drought i n Central Queensland,44
NA,many large fortunes were lost owing to,44
NA,the difficulty experienced by the pas-,44
NA,toralists i n transferring their stock to,44
NA,areas i n the southern portion of the State,44
NA,where there had been a good rainfall.,44
NA,Some of the pastoralists spent all their,44
NA,capital in feeding their stock on corn or any,44
NA,other fodder they could get. Some stock,44
NA,"was transferred to the coastal areas, and",44
NA,"hon- fed on sugar cane, and thousands of head",44
NA,Un- were railed from Longreach down to,44
NA,"Rockhampton, and thence to Brisbane,",44
NA,"and then on to Charieville, a distance of,",44
NA,"approximately, 1,200 miles. I f the rail-",44
NA,way proposed by the honorable member,44
NA,"for Macquarie had been built, the stock",44
NA,could have been saved by a railway jour-,44
NA,ney of 400 miles. I f the line sug-,44
NA,gested is built i t will presumably,44
NA,touch the main east and west Queens-,44
NA,"laud lines at Dajarra, 500 miles fro m",44
NA,"Townsville. on the Cloncurry line,",44
NA,"at. Winton on the Townsville line, and at",44
NA,"Blackall, 300 miles from Rockhampton,",44
NA,"and Quilpie, 500 miles west of Bris-",44
NA,bane. For the whole of the distance,44
NA,f r o m Bourke to Daly Waters there is,44
NA,some of the finest country i n Australia.,44
NA,I t is necessary to build this line,44
NA,for national reasons. I have not the,44
NA,"exact figures w i th me at the present time,",44
NA,but I think that Australia exports about,44
NA,"20 per cent, of its cattle; 80 per cent, are",44
NA,"killed for local consumption. A t any rate,",44
NA,i t is estimated that Australia oan supply,44
NA,its own meat requirements until its,44
NA,population is increased by another,44
NA,"every 2,0*00,000, and that afterwards there w i l l",44
NA,be a shortage. I t is stated i n the,44
NA,line Commonwealth Year-Bool: that i n 60,44
NA,years our population w i l l be approxi-,44
NA,"mately"" 20,000,000. I t can be readily",44
NA,"seen that, unless we build railways such",44
NA,"It as that now proposed, to develop our pas-",44
NA,"toral areas, there must be a serious short-",44
NA,age of cattle to meet the local consumption,44
NA,"i n Australia. W i t h i n the next few years,",44
NA,great areas of rich pastoral leasehold lands,45
NA,"i n the centre, south, west, and north",45
NA,Queensland w i l l revert to the Crown,45
NA,"be cut up f o r closer settlement. ""Where",45
NA,there are to-day a few hundreds of considered,45
NA,"pastoralists, i n a few years there w i",45
NA,thousands of small graziers. The wealthy land to the Northern Territory.,45
NA,squatter with a big capital behind h,45
NA,can pass through a period of drought,45
NA,"without being wiped out, but the small",45
NA,graziers with limited capital w i l l,45
NA,i n the same fortunate position. For,45
NA,"instance, they w i l l not be able to send",45
NA,"their stock over the long, circuitous r a i l upon the",45
NA,journey between Longreach and CharleQueensland,45
NA,ville by way of Rockhampton and Bris-,45
NA,"bane; but, i f the proposed railway is built,",45
NA,they can save their stock by transporting,45
NA,them over the much shorter route between,45
NA,Longreach and Charleville.,45
Mr MANNING ,Eve n if the small,45
NA,settlers could bear the expense of the long,45
NA,railway journey referred to by the honor-,45
NA,"able member, there would not be sumcient",45
NA,rolling-stock available f o r them.,45
Mr FORDE ,Tha t is another point.,45
NA,I n times of drought hundreds of people,45
NA,are calling out f o r rolling-stock. There,45
NA,are dozens of applications f o r special,45
NA,"trains, and the result is that many of the",45
NA,pastoralists are subjected to' long delays.,45
NA,"When sheep are i n a very low condition,",45
NA,thousnds of them may perish before a,45
NA,train is available to remove them.,45
NA,This railway would bring Darwin into,45
NA,"direct rai l communication with Sydney,",45
NA,"f r o m which i t is distant about 2,241",45
NA,"and also with Canberra, the new Seat of",45
NA,Government. I n the event of an inva-,45
NA,sion-whic h we hope w i l l never hap-,45
NA,pen-suc h a line would be of immense,45
NA,"strategic value, and I believe that the",45
NA,Commonwealth would be justified i n,45
NA,"building i t , i f only for defence purposes.",45
NA,Royal 'commissions have reported upon,45
NA,proposals for - the construction of a rail-,45
NA,"way along this route, but a good deal",45
NA,"of opposition has been shown to i t , be-",45
NA,cause of a fear that i t might prejudice,45
NA,"the north-south railway, and the honor-",45
NA,able member for Swan (Ma-. Gregory) has,45
NA,moved an amendment to the motion to,45
NA,provide for the construction of a line,45
NA,"from Broome, or Derby, i n an easterly",45
NA,direction to junction with the north-south,45
NA,"railway at or near Newcastle Waters,",45
NA,and then south of east to Camooweal. That,45
NA,railway is entirely distinct from the pro-,45
NA,posal now before the House. ' A section,45
NA,of of the north-south railway has already,45
NA,"and been authorized by this Parliament, and",45
NA,the Western Australian project must be,45
NA,apart f r o m the proposed line,45
NA,l l be f r o m Bourke through western Queens-,45
NA,None,45
NA,i m of these railways should be considered,45
NA,as competitive. I t is the responsibility,45
NA,of this Parliament to develop tho,45
NA,not be Northern Territory expeditiously and,45
NA,effectively. The Parliamentary Standing,45
NA,"Committee on Public Works, i n a report",45
NA,north-south and Central,45
NA,"railway proposals,-said:-",45
NA,The Barkly Tableland comprises a stretch of,45
NA,rich country something in the shape of a rhom-,45
NA,"boid, extending in a south-westerly direction",45
NA,from a little east of Newcastle . Waters practi-,45
NA,"cally to the Queensland border, a distance of",45
NA,"about 300 miles, by a width of about 150 miles,",45
NA,"and containing an area of approximately 40,000",45
NA,square miles. I t consists of slightly un-,45
NA,"dulating country, varying from 600 to 1,000",45
NA,"feet above sea level, and tbe rocks are almost",45
NA,"wholly cambrian quartzites, sandstone, lime-",45
NA,"stones, etc. The quartzites constituted the",45
NA,"so-called deserts-generall y low rises, covered",45
NA,with sparse timber-an d the black soil plains,45
NA,are covered with Mitchell grass. I t has no,45
NA,"permanent surface water of any consequence,",45
NA,"with the exception of Anthony's lagoon, which",45
NA,has been known to be dry in particularly bad sea-,45
NA,"sons, but has an annual average rainfall of be-",45
NA,"tween 15 and 20 inches, and large quantities of",45
NA,sub-artesian water can be obtained by boring,45
NA,practically anywhere. There are a number of,45
NA,"stations on the tableland, and some 200,000",45
NA,cattle are grazed there. A t one period there,45
NA,"were also 50,000 sheep at Avon Downs, but",45
NA,the breeding of sheep has lately been discon-,45
NA,tinued.,45
NA,"miles, I have been informed that the Barkly",45
NA,Tableland is very suitable f o r the,45
NA,"grazing of sheep; but, i n order to put the",45
NA,wool-growing industry on a commercial,45
NA,"basis, safeguard the graziers against",45
NA,"drought, and provide communication",45
NA,"with a portion of the coast, the",45
NA,railway is necessary. I f i t were con-,45
NA,"structed, settlers on the tableland would",45
NA,have direct and speedy access to the,45
NA,"ports of Townsville and Rockhampton,",45
NA,and to Brisbane and Sydney. I am a,45
NA,firm believer i n the past American and,45
NA,Canadian system of land development by,45
NA,the construction of railways in rich areas,45
NA,in advance of settlement. I n those coun-,45
NA,tries railways are regarded as pioneering,45
NA,"agents, and are not expected to pay im-",45
NA,mediately. We .cannot expect people to,45
NA,invest large sums i n the Northern Ter-,45
NA,ritory u n t i l railway communication is,45
NA,provided.,45
Mr RODGERS ,Bu t I do not think we,46
NA,can expect any railways i n that coun-,46
NA,try to pay.,46
Mr FORDE , I could supply the hon-,46
NA,orable member with statistics to prove,46
NA,that railways are - Dot profitable i n any,46
NA,"new country, and, with few exceptions,",46
NA,are unprofitable the world over.,46
NA,better to supplement the earnings of,46
NA,railway systems from the,46
NA,"revenue than, by the charging of",46
NA,"exorbitant fares and freights, to place",46
NA,an unbearable burden upon the people,46
NA,in country districts. A n y one travelling,46
NA,through Central Western Queensland at,46
NA,thc present time must appreciate the,46
NA,urgent necessity f o r the construction of,46
NA,the proposed railway. When I was in,46
NA,Rockhampton a few weeks ago four and,46
NA,five sheep trains were passing through,46
NA,every night with stock,46
NA,being removed f r o m drought-affected,46
NA,areas to southern pastures.,46
NA,w i th stout hearts and,46
NA,pectations have invested money i n land,46
NA,"and stock i n Western Queensland,",46
NA,and some of them told me that they have,46
NA,"suffered losses ranging f r o m £5,000 to",46
NA,"£20,000 during the last few months owing",46
NA,to the drought. Many of them have lost,46
NA,the savings of a life time. We must give,46
NA,adequate means of transport to the people,46
NA,who are prepared to pioneer this country.,46
NA,I t is the duty of this Parliament to do,46
NA,anything possible to ameliorate the dis-,46
NA,tress of the settlers of inland Australia,46
NA,and the Northern Territory. Honorable,46
NA,members have a responsibility to view,46
NA,"this project, not f r o m a State point of",46
NA,"view, but as a great national concern,",46
NA,worthy of the intelligent consideration of,46
NA,the Parliament of the Commonwealth.,46
NA,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 p.m.,46
Mr DUNCAN,HUGHES (Boothby),46
NA,[S.0] - I have listened with interest,46
NA,to the debate on this,46
NA,there has been very little discus-,46
NA,sion of the amendment. The motion,46
NA,appears to me to be one of great import-,46
NA,"ance, which will repay f u l l consideration",46
NA,before a decision on' i t is registered.,46
NA,shall not speak this evening at great,46
NA,"length, but I hope to present a few facts",46
NA,in support of the claim which I have,46
NA,made. The suggestion was made by the,46
NA,honorable member for Herbert (Dr N o t t ),46
NA,that as honorable members from his State,46
NA,"voted f or the north-south line, honorable",46
NA,members from the southern States should,46
NA,reciprocate by voting for this motion. I,46
NA,do not wish to display ingratitude to any,46
NA,"honorable member, whether he is a",46
NA,Queenslander or not f o r his attitude to the',46
NA,north-south line; but I point out that,46
NA,the construction of that line w i l l be,46
NA,Tt is simply the partial fulfilment of a,46
NA,"contract entered into years ago,",46
NA,general and that no possible .claim can,46
NA,arise i n regard to i t . The respon-,46
NA,sibility for proceeding with the construc-,46
NA,ton of that line rested on the whole,46
NA,"House, and I was glad to see that hon-",46
NA,orable members from Queensland recog-,46
NA,nized that fact just as did honorable mem-,46
NA,bers f r o m other States. I should like,46
NA,"to ask the honorable member for Herbert,",46
NA,as he recognizes the obligation resting,46
NA,upon this Parliament i n regard to the,46
NA,"that was line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs,",46
NA,whether he agrees that the responsibility,46
NA,People is equally great to construct the line,46
NA,great ex- northwards from Alice Springs to Daly,46
NA,"Waters. I f he admits the one obligation,",46
NA,it seems to me that he is forced to concede,46
NA,the other.,46
Dr NOTT , I admitted that i n agreeing,46
NA,"to construct the north-south, line we were",46
NA,honouring an obligation.,46
Mr DUNCAN,HUGHES -Tha t is to,46
NA,"say, so far as the line to Alice Springs is",46
NA,"concerned, but what about the line not",46
NA,yet authorized from Alice Springs to Daly,46
NA,Waters ?,46
Dr NOTT , I am willing to agree to,46
NA,the construction of that.,46
Mr DUNCAN,HUGHES -The n I,46
NA,suggest to the honorable member that the,46
NA,"proper thing for him to, do is to support",46
NA,the construction of that line before he,46
NA,"votes f or this motion, which refers",46
NA,to a line which is not a con-,46
NA,tractual responsibility of the Common-,46
NA,wealth. I t has been stated by honorable,46
NA,"members, including the honorable member",46
NA,"motion- for Herbert, that i t is futil e to suggest",46
NA,that the line proposed has anything to do,46
NA,with the north-south line. I must say,46
NA,"plainly and briefly, that I cannot for one",46
NA,moment agree with that. I endorse the,46
NA,I interjections of the honorable member for,46
NA,NA,46
NA,-how any one can escape tho,46
NA,point expressed in them. I t is surely,46
NA,within the knowledge of every honorable,46
NA,member that for some years there has,46
NA,been much discussion as to the route which,46
NA,"should be followed, and particularly as",47
NA,to whether the line should be constructed,47
NA,entirely - i n South Australia and the,47
NA,"Northern Territory, or should be diverted",47
NA,"into New South ""Wales and Queensland,",47
NA,in which event i t would pass through,47
NA,"Camooweal, and proceed from there i n a",47
NA,north-westerly direction to Darwin.,47
NA,is within the knowledge of every member,47
NA,of the community who takes an interest,47
NA,i n these matters that there has been a,47
NA,division of opinion as to which is the best,47
NA,route. Residents in my State have always,47
NA,maintained that the direct route should,47
NA,"be followed, because that is specified i n",47
NA,the contract; but honorable,47
NA,bers from the eastern States have,47
NA,sometimes thought that the contract did,47
NA,"not exist, and that the line should be",47
NA,diverted eastwards. I am sure that,47
NA,there is no one who will not agree that,47
NA,those two routes have been under con-,47
NA,"sideration, and that the construc-",47
NA,tion of neither of them has yet,47
NA,"been completely approved. Therefore, I put",47
NA,i t to honorable members that i f this mo-,47
NA,"tion were carried, and were acted upon",47
NA,"by the Government, the effect of i t would",47
NA,"be to renounce the contract, and to give",47
NA,effect to the alternative scheme.,47
Dr NOTT ,Tha t is not the object of,47
NA,the motion.,47
Mr DUNCAN , HUGHES - I am not,47
NA,imputing an object or an improper,47
NA,"motive to any one, but that will be the",47
NA,effect of carrying the motion i f the Go-,47
NA,vernment considers that i t should give,47
NA,effect to itThe motion is that a line,47
NA,be constructed f r o m Bourke to Clon-,47
NA,"curry, and from there, presumably via or",47
NA,"close to Camooweal, to Dalv Waters.",47
NA,The inevitable result of that would,47
NA,"be that for many years, and possibly",47
NA,"for all time, the obligation to construct",47
NA,a line southwards from Daly Waters,47
NA,to Alice Springs would be shelved. For,47
NA,my part I have made my attitude clear,47
NA,right f r o m the time when I entered this,47
NA,"Parliament, and I repeat to-night that I",47
NA,"w i l l not be a party to any proposal which,",47
NA,"in my opinion, w i l l alter the route of the",47
NA,north-south line so as to remove i t outside,47
NA,the central State. I f the line f r o m Bourke,47
NA,"to Cloncurry, Camooweal, and Daly",47
NA,"Waters is constructed, we may say that,",47
NA,"almost as a matter of course, the proposed",47
NA,line f r o m Daly Waters south to Alice,47
NA,Springs w i l l be l e f t unfinished f o r many first.,47
NA,years. I repeat that that line has to. be,47
NA,"constructed under a definite contract, to",47
NA,which the Commonwealth Government,47
NA,has set its hand; but i n regard to the,47
NA,"line covered by the motion, the Govern-",47
NA,"ment has accepted no responsibility,",47
NA,although I do not say that i t may,47
NA,not have a moral responsibility i n,47
NA,It such cases. The line from Oodna-,47
NA,datta to Alice Springs is even yet,47
NA,only i n course of survey. When I voted,47
NA,three years ago for the Emungalan to,47
NA,"Daly Waters line, I anticipated that there",47
NA,would be a more vigorous prosecution of,47
NA,the enterprise than there appears to have,47
NA,been. The real point to which I,47
NA,memwish to address myself has not yet been,47
NA,"referred to i n this debate, and yet i t is a",47
NA,point of some importance-th e cost of,47
NA,the proposal. We may all agree that the,47
NA,"proposal, on the face of i t , seems to be",47
NA,desirable. I f we take a map of Australia,47
NA,"and notice where Bourke, Cloncurry,",47
NA,"Camooweal and Daly Waters are, i t is",47
NA,obvious that the line would develop un-,47
NA,"developed country, or at any rate, would",47
NA,provide modern. transport where i t is,47
NA,"needed, - I say tliat one should not em-",47
NA,bark on schemes of this kind f or no other,47
NA,reason than that they appear to be de-,47
NA,sirable. I am the seventh member to,47
NA,speak i n this debate. Of those who have,47
NA,"spoken before me, four have come from",47
NA,Queensland. I do not suggest that those,47
NA,honorable members have not studied 'the,47
NA,"question, at least i n p r i n t ; but has one of",47
NA,"them, and i f there is one of them, have",47
NA,"two of them, seen this route? Have they",47
NA,been to Bourke and worked their way,47
NA,northwards via Cloncurry across the,47
NA,Barkly Tablelands to Daly Waters? I t,47
NA,is very unlikely that any one of them has,47
NA,"done that, and yet i t is most important,",47
NA,befoTe we come to a decision on this ques-,47
NA,"tion, that we should have information",47
NA,"from persons, not necessarily experts, who",47
NA,have studied the question on the spot.,47
Dr NOTT , I s i t not a fact that,47
NA,"6,000,000 sheep died there recently as a",47
NA,result of the drought?,47
Mr DUNCAN , HUGHE S - Many,47
NA,unfortunate things happen i n this world,47
NA,whicli would be prevented i f i t were,47
NA,financially possible to prevent them. It,47
NA,is a question of the extent to which thc,47
NA,"country can afford to remedy them, and",47
NA,which of our troubles should be remedied,47
NA,We cannot say that because a,47
NA,proposal seems desirable on the face,47
NA,"of i t , or can be proved to be desir-",48
NA,"able, i t must be at once accepted. Par-",48
NA,ticularly is that so when dealing wrth,48
NA,a country of such enormous area of,48
NA,the country as that with which we are,48
NA,now concerned. I shall say very little on,48
NA,"the question of cost, but what I have to",48
NA,say I hope w i l l cause some honorable,48
NA,members to think seriously before they,48
NA,vote f o r what w i l l be a heavy incubus on,48
NA,the Commonwealth. I n 1923 we passed,48
NA,an act f or the construction of the,48
NA,Emuugalan to Daly Waters line.,48
NA,was an extension of the existing line,48
NA,"southwards for 160 miles, and i t was to",48
NA,cost the Commonwealth a sum not ex-,48
NA,"ceeding £1,545,000 . I n 1924 we author-",48
NA,ized the construction of the Grafton to,48
NA,"South Brisbane line, which was to cost",48
NA,"the Commonwealth £3,500,000, plus dis-",48
NA,"count, and the expenses of borrowing.",48
NA,Early i n this year we passed the act,48
NA,"for the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs line,",48
NA,"which is to cost £1,700,000.",48
NA,"circumstances, I feel perfectly justified i n",48
NA,raising the question of the probable cost,48
NA,of giving effect to this new scheme.,48
Mr RODGERS ,Hav e the sponsors of,48
NA,the line given any particulars as to that?,48
Mr DUNCAN,HUGHES -No t,48
NA,my knowledge.,48
Mr MANNING , I f this line had been,48
NA,in operation during the last twelve months,48
NA,"the lives of 6,000,000 sheep could have",48
NA,been saved.,48
Mr DUNCAN,HUGHES -,48
NA,question is not what could have been,48
NA,"saved, but whether f r o m a business point",48
NA,of view there is sufficient capital available,48
NA,to expend on the project. A business man,48
NA,has to consider what undertakings shall,48
NA,"be the first charge on his available capital,",48
NA,and I submit that that is the standpoint,48
NA,from which we should look at this pro-,48
NA,posal. The cost of the line f r o m Emun-,48
NA,galan to Daly Waters works out at,48
NA,"nearly £10,000 a mile, possibly portions",48
NA,of the suggested line might be built f o r,48
NA,a little less than that. The honorable,48
NA,member f o r Kennedy ( Mr G. Erancis),48
NA,stated that the distance f r o m Bourke,48
NA,"to Daly Waters is 1,230",48
NA,"I n that event, this line would prob-",48
NA,"ably cost between £12,000,000 and",48
NA,"£13,000,000, although i t might be built",48
NA,"for £10,000,000. I f my figures are",48
NA,wrong I shall be glad to have them cor-,48
NA,rected. I submit that this House ought,48
NA,to give very careful consideration to any,48
NA,project which involves the country i n such,48
NA,"heavy expenditure, notwithstanding that",48
NA,the work might be most desirable from,48
NA,many points of view. I n addition to the,48
NA,railway undertakings that I have enume-,48
NA,rated as having been agreed to by this,48
NA,"Parliament i n the last four years, we",48
NA,must not forget that our railway gauges,48
NA,need u n i f y i n g : I shall not evade the,48
NA,fact that a large expenditure is necessary,48
NA,under that heading i n my own State. I t,48
NA,"has been suggested that the £12,000,000",48
NA,That necessary to build this railway might be,48
NA,"appropriated f r o m migration loans, but",48
NA,"before that could be done, the States con-",48
NA,"cerned would have to agree, and as New",48
NA,South Wales has not yet approved of the,48
NA,"migration scheme, I do not see how i t",48
NA,"can be expected that this railway, at",48
NA,least i n so far as New South Wales is,48
NA,"concerned, can be built out of money",48
NA,derived from that source.,48
Mr MANNING ,Onl y 100 miles of the,48
NA,I n these line would run through New South Wales.,48
Mr DUNCAN , HUGHE S - Apar t,48
NA,"f r o m the New South Wales portion, f o r",48
NA,a long distance i t would run through the,48
NA,"Northern Territory, and the question",48
NA,"arises whether, i n present circumstances,",48
NA,the Government would be justified,48
NA,to in spending immigration money i n,48
NA,building that portion of i t . W i t h all due,48
NA,deference may I say that i t appears to me,48
NA,that such a project should have,48
NA,"been introduced, not by means of",48
NA,"a private member's motion, but by",48
NA,"The a responsible Government, and then",48
NA,only after the fullest and closest,48
NA,investigation had been made. This would,48
NA,"be a very long railway, and as i t would",48
NA,"involve the country i n enormous expense,",48
NA,i t should have been left to the Govern-,48
NA,ment to consider the wisdom or otherwise,48
NA,of bringing the proposal before us. I t is,48
NA,not a matter for surprise that honorable,48
NA,members who represent divisions i n New,48
NA,South Wales and Queensland support the,48
NA,building of the suggested line f r o m the,48
NA,"eastern side, while honorable members",48
NA,who represent Western Australian divi-,48
NA,sions contend that i t should be constructed,48
NA,f r o m the western side.,48
NA,miles.,48
Mr MANNING ,Honorabl e members,48
NA,who represent New South Wales' and,48
NA,Queensland had sufficient vision to sup-,48
NA,port the building of the north-south rail-,48
NA,way.,48
Mr DUNCAN , HUGHES - I do not,48
NA,desire to appear ungrateful for what has,48
NA,"been done i n that respect, but since",48
NA,"the honorable member presses me, I",49
NA,may be permitted to point out that no,49
NA,division was taken on the proposal to,49
NA,build the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs,49
NA,line. I do not suppose fo r a moment that,49
NA,honorable members who represent New,49
NA,South Wales and Queensland would de-,49
NA,liberately hinder the Government f u l -,49
NA,filling both a legal and a moral obliga-,49
NA,tion. But there is nothing of that kind,49
NA,to be considered i n connexion w i th this,49
NA,"scheme, which is entirely different f r o m",49
NA,either the north-south or the east-west,49
NA,railway projects. The building of the,49
NA,north-south line is a matter of contract,49
NA,between the Commonwealth and South,49
NA,Australian Governments; and the east-,49
NA,"west line was laid, not only f o r defence",49
NA,"purposes, but also to provide Western",49
NA,Australia w i t h some internal means of,49
NA,communication w i t h the rest of the Com-,49
NA,monwealth; but this proposal is for a,49
NA,purely developmental railway. I agree,49
NA,that i t would be within the power of the,49
NA,Commonwealth to undertake the work,49
NA,under the provisions of section 51 sub-,49
NA,"section xxxiv. of the Constitution, which",49
NA,provides that-,49
NA,"The Parliament shall, subject to this",49
NA,"stitution, have power to make laws for",49
NA,"peace, order, and good government of the",49
NA,Commonwealth with respect to-,49
NA,(xxxiv.) railway construction and exten-,49
NA,sion in any State with the consent of,49
NA,State.,49
NA,But there is no reason for it having,49
NA,"thing to do with the matter yet, for it",49
NA,not been approached by either of the,49
NA,States concerned. I regret that,49
NA,vernment will not give me permission to,49
NA,"continue my remarks at a later date, for, strategic purposes.",49
NA,not only is there a good deal more that,49
NA,"I should like to say, but I know that",49
NA,other honorable members who are absent,49
NA,to-day desire to discuss the question.,49
NA,the motion is to be forced to a vote towhich,49
NA,"night, as the Grafton to South",49
NA,proposal was forced to a vote some years,49
NA,"ago, I shall vote against it and also",49
NA,amendment. A contract made by the,49
NA,Commonwealth Government,49
NA,South Australian Government,49
NA,"yet been completed, and no suggestion has",49
NA,been made that the Government,49
NA,to introduce a bill in the near future,49
NA,a railway from Alice Springs to Daly,49
NA,Waters. What is more important,49
NA,"is, that if the House should pass this",49
NA,Mr Duncan-Hughes.,49
NA,"motion, and theGovernment gave effect",49
NA,"to i t , i t is unlikely that the north-south",49
NA,r a i l w a y ' would be completed fo r very,49
NA,"many years, i f at all. I n these circum-",49
NA,"stances, I have no alternative but to vote",49
NA,against both the motion and the amend-,49
NA,ment.,49
NA,NA,49
NA,tend to support the amendment. All,49
NA,schemes f o r constructing railways into,49
NA,undeveloped country should be subjected,49
NA,to the most eareful investigation. Reports,49
NA,submitted to us f r o m time to time have,49
NA,"recommended that, f o r strategical pur-",49
NA,"poses, a railway line should be con-",49
NA,"structed right round the Commonwealth,",49
NA,but a considerable distance f r o m the,49
NA,coast. The late E a r l Kitchener advised,49
NA,that that should be done. The proposal,49
NA,of the honorable member f o r Swan ( Mr .,49
NA,Gregory) is that a section of that belt of,49
NA,railway shall be constructed through one,49
NA,of the righest portions of tropical Aus-,49
NA,"tralia, which has been known f o r more",49
NA,than 80 years. A f t e r Sir George Grey,49
NA,"visited the Kimberleys, he strongly re-",49
NA,commended the Government of the day,49
NA,to encourage settlement there. The land,49
NA,in that locality is unquestionably fer-,49
NA,"Contile, and the only reason f o r its non-",49
NA,the development is that i t is not connected,49
NA,by railway w i t h the settled parts of Aus-,49
NA,tralia. The honorable member for,49
NA,Boothby ( Mr Duncan-Hughes) sug-,49
NA,the gested that the adoption of this proposal,49
NA,would render most unlikely the com-,49
NA,anypletion of the north-south railway; but,49
NA,has that is not i n my mind. I consider that,49
NA,the State Governments should build their,49
NA,"the Goown railway lines, except when special",49
NA,railways are needed i n their territory f o r,49
NA,New South Wales,49
NA,and Queensland have constructed railways,49
NA,running inland from the coast. I n Wes-,49
NA,tern Australia we have already three late-,49
NA,"If ral railways connected up, by means of",49
NA,settlers are enabled to go into the,49
NA,Brisbane back country. The railway suggested by,49
NA,the honorable member for Swan would,49
NA,the form a part of a necessary permanent,49
NA,railway round Australia. I t would,49
NA,pass through excellent country from,49
NA,with the,49
NA,Broome or Derby to Newcastle Waters.,49
NA,"has not I t should quickly induce settlement, be-",49
NA,cause that country is capable of carrying,49
NA,intends many sheep and cattle. I t might be,49
NA,for connected with the line which Western,49
NA,Australia has constructed from Perth to,49
NA,to me Geraidton and away up to Meekathara.,49
Dr NOTT ,Ha a the honorable mem-,50
NA,"ber read Sir George Buchanan's report,",50
NA,and his reference to a proposed connexion,50
NA,-with the Queensland central railway?,50
NA,NA,50
NA,port i n connexion with harbour improve-,50
NA,ment. The coastal portions of Austra-,50
NA,lia are served by shipping facilities. The,50
NA,railway proposed by the honorable mem-,50
NA,ber f o r Swan is absolutely necessary i n,50
NA,order to promote settlement on the rich,50
NA,and fertile country which i t would open,50
NA,up. A t Newcastle Waters the proposed,50
NA,line would connect with the north-south,50
NA,"railway, and could then be continued",50
NA,through to Camooweal to link up with,50
NA,the Queensland railway system. I have,50
NA,no wish to question the reasonableness of,50
NA,the proposal of the honorable member,50
NA,"for Macquarie, for the construction of",50
NA,a line that would be of service to the,50
NA,sometimes arid portions of New South,50
NA,Wales and Queensland; but we should,50
NA,have a concerted plan of railway construc-,50
NA,"tion, and i f a line were constructed from",50
NA,"Meekathara to Broome, thence across to",50
NA,"Newcastle Waters and on to Camooweal,",50
NA,we should have a railway right round,50
NA,Australia. The construction of a railway,50
NA,at the same time strategic and develop-,50
NA,"mental, ' such as that suggested by the",50
NA,"honorable member for Swan, is deserving",50
NA,of tbe gravest consideration by this,50
NA,House.,50
Mr BOWDEN ,Parramatta) [8.35].,50
NA,-W e can all agree that this is a very,50
NA,"important motion, and that the railway",50
NA,construction suggested by the honorable,50
NA,member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning),50
NA,will be necessary at some time or other.,50
NA,No doubt a railway will yet be con-,50
NA,structed from Cloncurry to Newcastle,50
NA,"Waters, and thence right across the con-",50
NA,tinent to Derby or Broome. Such a line,50
NA,would open up the most productive por-,50
NA,"tions of the Northern Territory, and",50
NA,"would do, perhaps, more than anything",50
NA,else that could be suggested to encourage,50
NA,its settlement and development. But I,50
NA,cannot lose sight of the fact that the,50
NA,Government has proposed the appoint-,50
NA,ment of a commission to govern the,50
NA,Northern Territory. The two railways,50
NA,referred to i n the motion and amendment,50
NA,are lines which should assist i n the de-,50
NA,velopment of the Territory. Our first,50
NA,thought i n considering them should be its,50
NA,"development. We have had before us,",50
NA,"from time to time, different schemes for",50
NA,railway construction. I t has been sug-,50
NA,gested that a line should be built across,50
NA,the Barkly Tableland to the mouth of the,50
NA,MCArthur River. Another scheme pro-,50
NA,would link that line up with the,50
NA,north-south railway at Newcastle Waters.,50
NA,But i t seems to me that the House is not,50
NA,"in a position, at the present time, either to",50
NA,affirm or to refuse to affirm the desirabi-,50
NA,lity of the proposed railway construction.,50
NA,"I f we did so, we should lay ourselves open",50
NA,"to the charge of recklessly, and without",50
NA,"due consideration, committing the Parlia-",50
NA,ment to enormous expenditure. The cost,50
NA,of the railway construction proposed,50
NA,"would not be thousands, or hundreds of",50
NA,"thousands, but millions of pounds. That",50
NA,a proposal involving such an enor-,50
NA,mous expediture should be sub-,50
NA,"mitted to the House i n this way,",50
NA,and that honorable members should be,50
NA,expected to vote upon i t is not very com-,50
NA,plimentary to them. We need further,50
NA,inquiry and a great deal more informa-,50
NA,tion than we have concerning these,50
NA,proposals. I n all fairness to the Northern,50
NA,"Territory Commission should we not,",50
NA,"before agreeing to such proposals, learn",50
NA,what its policy of development and its,50
NA,opinion with regard to railway construc-,50
NA,tion may be? I agree with the honorable,50
NA,member f o r Macquarie that the railway,50
NA,he has suggested would be of immense,50
NA,advantage to the people of Australia. I,50
NA,"go so f a r with him, but I cannot go any",50
NA,farther. We have very scanty informa-,50
NA,tion as to the cost of the proposed line.,50
NA,We have had estimates running f r o m,50
NA,"£10,000,000 up to £-10,000,000. We have",50
NA,no information as to the way i n which,50
NA,the proposal is viewed by the State Go-,50
NA,vernments concerned. We do not know,50
NA,whether they would or would not consent,50
NA,"to i t , or whether they would be",50
NA,prepared to bear part of the cost,50
NA,of the line within the boundaries,50
NA,"of their States, or would expect",50
NA,the Commonwealth Government to,50
NA,bear the whole of the cost. We should,50
NA,have information on all these points,50
NA,before we are ask^d to vote f o r a proposal,50
NA,of this kind. These considerations pre-,50
NA,vent me f r o m supporting the motion. The,50
NA,honorable member f or Boothby ( Mr .,50
NA,Duncan-Hughes) has suggested that,50
NA,i f the line proposed by the honorable,50
NA,"member f o r Macquarie were undertaken,",50
NA,the north-south railway would be allowed,50
NA,"to go by the board. I do not think so,",50
NA,because the construction of the railways,51
NA,proposed i n the motion and amend-,51
NA,ment would not relieve this Par-,51
NA,liament of its obligations i n con-,51
NA,nexion with the north-south railway.,51
NA,Sympathetic as I am with both proposals,51
NA,"suggested, I could not possibly vote f o r '",51
NA,them. I think that the honorable mem-,51
NA,ber f o r Macquarie should be satisfied with,51
NA,the expression of opinion given i n the dis-,51
NA,"cussion of his motion, and would do well",51
NA,not to press i t to a division.,51
Mr FOSTER ,Wakefield) [ 8 . 4 0 ],51
NA,agreew i th the honorable member f o r,51
NA,Parramatta ( Mr Bowden) i n the view,51
NA,he has expressed of the impracticability,51
NA,of adopting the course suggested by the,51
NA,honorable member f o r Macquarie ( Mr .,51
NA,"Manning), and thus committing this",51
NA,"House, as the passing of the motion would",51
NA,"do, to a financial responsibility running",51
NA,"into f r o m £8,000,000 to £10,000,000, or",51
NA,more. What condition have we got into,51
NA,i n this National Parliament when we talk,51
NA,of millions as i f they were thousands?,51
NA,Five or six years ago such a proposal as,51
NA,the honorable member f o r Macquarie has,51
NA,submitted would never have been dreamed,51
NA,of i n this Parliament. The honorable,51
NA,member does not know what the railway,51
NA,he proposes would cost. He has given us,51
NA,"no information as to the route, nor has",51
NA,he told us the r a i n f a l l 6r character of the,51
NA,country through which the line would go.,51
NA,Yet the honorable member would commit,51
NA,this House to the expenditure of all these,51
NA,millions of money. N o wonder the tax-,51
NA,payers say that this Parliament has,51
NA,money to burn. I t is not decent to put,51
NA,honorable members i n such a position as,51
NA,they are placed i n by being asked to vote,51
NA,for such a motion. They should realize,51
NA,their responsibilities to the country. So,51
NA,f a r as the development of the Northern,51
NA,"Territory is concerned, we have passed a",51
NA,bill under wliich a commission is to be,51
NA,appointed to which that development is,51
NA,to be entrusted. The b i l l imposes great,51
NA,"responsibilities upon the commission, in-",51
NA,order that action may be taken on the,51
NA,"spot, and things requiring to be done may",51
NA,"be done promptly, and there may be a",51
NA,cessation of tho wasteful expenditure of,51
NA,money to no purpose that has taken place,51
NA,in the Northern Territory since i t was,51
NA,transferred to the Commonwealth.,51
NA,want honorable members to exercise a,51
NA,"little commonsense, and to have some",51
NA,regard f o r the position they occupy as,51
NA,representatives of the people. I should,51
NA,like a stop to be put to the hypocritical,51
NA,nonsense that is talked concerning the,51
NA,responsibility of the Commonwealth Go-,51
NA,vernment and Parliament f o r the con-,51
NA,struction of the north-south railway and,51
NA,the development of the Northern Terri-,51
NA,tory on the lines agreed to when i t was,51
NA,taken over by the Commonwealth. I f i t,51
NA,"is not developed i n a practical fashion,",51
NA,honorable members need not continue,51
NA,- I their hypocrisy about maintaining a,51
NA,White Australia. Without development,51
NA,"of the Territory, they cannot have a",51
NA,White Australia. We have no right to,51
NA,continue. to hold the Territory without,51
NA,using i t . When we consider that there,51
NA,are millions of God's people close to our,51
NA,"borders, who scarcely have room to turn,",51
NA,we cannot expect to keep Australia white,51
NA,i f we do not make use of the couutry.,51
NA,The League of Nations has already inti-,51
NA,mated that we must be prepared to make,51
NA,use of the Territory under our control or,51
NA,tear down our barriers against coloured,51
NA,labour.,51
Mr FENTON ,Th e honorable member,51
NA,should not talk i n that way.,51
Mr FOSTER ,Th e world w i l l soon,51
NA,be talking i n that way. The League of,51
NA,Nations has given an unmistakable note,51
NA,of warning to Australia.,51
Mr FENTON , I think the honorable,51
NA,member had better leave that subject,51
NA,alone.,51
Mr FOSTER , I shall approach the,51
NA,question from another aspect. I t is,51
NA,about time that this Parliament decided,51
NA,"whether i t is to attend to its own business,",51
NA,"or build railways here, there, and every-",51
NA,where. We have had before us during,51
NA,the last three or four years proposals un-,51
NA,supported by expert advice to embark,51
NA,upon projects involving the expenditure,51
NA,"of millions of pounds; but fortunately,",51
NA,by vigorous and definite resistance in,51
NA,"this House, we have been delivered from",51
NA,many financial responsibilities into which,51
NA,we would otherwise have been rushed. The,51
NA,history of railway construction i n the,51
NA,States ought to teach us a lesson. Before,51
NA,plunging into the expenditure of money,51
NA,on building a network of railways that,51
NA,would be an incubus on the Common-,51
NA,"wealth and keep taxation high, we should",51
NA,I,51
NA,endeavour to secure efficiency on the lines,51
NA,already controlled by the Commonwealth.,51
NA,"I n any case, we havo no right to build",51
NA,railways .outside our own territory. I t,52
NA,is the business of the States to do that.,52
NA,Nor can we build railways properly from,52
NA,Melbourne. Railway companies operat-,52
NA,ing in other parts of the world never,52
NA,dream of undertaking the construction,52
NA,and control of railways which,52
NA,separated from their own particular,52
NA,systems. I f a wise railway company,52
NA,intends to build a railway which,52
NA,"is separated from its own system,",52
NA,i t will arrange for another company,52
NA,whose system ad joins its new line to build,52
NA,"and operate i t , turning into a profit-",52
NA,able concern what otherwise could not,52
NA,f a i l to be a losing proposition.,52
NA,we enter upon any project to build rail-,52
NA,"ways outside our own territory, we ought",52
NA,to have most efficient expert advice to,52
NA,tell us whether we are likely to do right,52
NA,or wrong. Political railways have been,52
NA,the curse of the Australian railway,52
NA,systems. I n every State lines built by,52
NA,"political influence have been abandoned,",52
NA,and i n many cases pulled up. The hon-,52
NA,orable member for Macquarie proposes to,52
NA,build a line through pastoral country,52
NA,w i th a very limited rainfall. Railways,52
NA,never pay i n pastoral country.,52
Dr NOTT ,Doe s the honorable mem-,52
NA,ber contend that the north-south line,52
NA,will pay ?,52
Mr FOSTER , I do not expect i t to,52
NA,"pay unless, in addition to pastoral coun-",52
NA,"try, i t opens up mineral and other",52
NA,wealth. There are more unprofitable,52
NA,railways i n Queensland than there are i n,52
NA,any other State. The Queensland rail-,52
NA,ways did not succeed i n paying even be-,52
NA,fore tbe calamitous reign of terror,52
NA,through which the State is now passing.,52
NA,I do not think 1 am far wrong i n de-,52
NA,scribing the administration of the Labour,52
NA,Government in Queensland as a reign of,52
NA,terror. This Parliament has put its,52
NA,signature to an agreement to build a,52
NA,"railway from Oodnadatta to Darwin, but",52
NA,that agreement was made on the' under-,52
NA,standing that even when the Territory,52
NA,was cut through from north to south by,52
NA,a railway its transport requirements,52
NA,would not be f u l l y met. I t was antici-,52
NA,"pated-, even before the transfer of the",52
NA,"Territory to the Commonwealth, that the",52
NA,building of the north-south railway,52
NA,"would be but the beginning, and that the",52
NA,programme of railway development i n the,52
NA,Northern Territor y would not be com-,52
NA,pleted u n t il lines were built running east,52
NA,and west to the nearest ports i n Queens-,52
NA,land and Western Australia. The pro-,52
NA,posal of the honorable member f o r Mac-,52
NA,quarie is not new. Twenty years ago our,52
NA,"old friend, Mr Waddell, brought for-",52
NA,ward a similar proposal. I t was exam-,52
NA,"ined and dissected i n every way, and i f",52
NA,are it was a good proposition why was i t not,52
NA,taken i n hand by the wealthy State of,52
NA,"New South Wales, or the State of Queens-",52
NA,"land, the wealthiest i n the Commonwealth",52
NA,while i t was under good management and,52
NA,was enjoying bounteous prosperity? I t,52
NA,was not carried out because i t would have,52
NA,brought no advantage to those States. Yet,52
NA,the honorable member f or Macquarie is,52
NA,Before quite willing that the Commonwealth,52
NA,should accept the responsibility. I t is,52
NA,about time the Commonwealth ceased do-,52
NA,ing so much work f o r the States. A thor-,52
NA,ough investigation of our financial posi-,52
NA,"tion, which we have not had f or many",52
NA,"years, would show how impossible i t is",52
NA,for us to embark upon these wild-goose,52
NA,"proposals, which have nothing to recom-",52
NA,mend them. Honorable members should,52
NA,cease recommending the Commonwealth,52
NA,to embark on the expenditure of millions,52
NA,of pounds on projects which have not,52
NA,been reported on by experts.,52
Mr FORDE ,Th e building of this line,52
NA,would save millions of pounds' worth of,52
NA,cattle and sheep.,52
Mr FOSTER ,-Ho w many - times,52
NA,would i t do so?,52
Mr FORDE ,Ever y fou r years.,52
Mr FOSTER ,The n all I can say,52
NA,is that i t would pass through some very,52
NA,poor country.,52
Mr FORDE ,Drough t occurs i n the,52

Mr FOSTER ," I am aware of that,",52
NA,but I also know that a drought very,52
NA,"rarely occurs everywhere at the same time,",52
NA,and that except about once i n fifteen or,52

Mr COLEMAN ,Reid) [ 9 . 0 ] - I take,53
NA,this opportunity to protest against,53
NA,delay of the Government i n announcing,53
NA,"its decision i n regard to the subsidy for conditions,",53
NA,the mail and shipping services to the,53
NA,"Pacific Islands. For many years past,",53
NA,"Burns, Philp and Company has been paid",53
NA,by the Commonwealth asubsidy f o r i n,53
NA,the maintenance of regular shipping,53
NA,and mail services to the mandated,53
NA,"Territory of New Guinea, Papua, and January,",53
NA,"other Pacific Islands,",53
NA,Australia trades. The inference,53
NA,"be drawn f r o m a departmental paper,",53
NA,"dated the 16th March, and tabled i n",53
NA,"House a few weeks ago, is that the",53
NA,"vernment intends to abandon the arknow,",53
NA,"rangement with Burns, Philp and Comthat",53
NA,"pany, and endeavour to substitute an",53
NA,arrangement with foreign shipping comon,53
NA,"panies, possibly employing Chinamen,",53
NA,"cars, and other coloured labour. I f that",53
NA,"is the intention of the Government,",53
NA,enter my emphatic protest against a step,53
NA,which is calculated to seriously injur,53
NA,Australian shipping and trade ancl throw,53
NA,out of work several hundred white seaTo,53
NA,men. I n excusing the long delay that has,53
NA,"taken place, i n completing the arrangepany's",53
NA,"ments f o r a new Pacific mail contract,",53
NA,the document to which I have already,53
NA,referred says - 1,53
NA,"It is, therefore, proposed to invite",53
NA,from companies trading - between Melbourne that have been made.,53
NA,"on the one hand, and Singapore and Hong",53
NA,"Kong on the other hand, to make regular calls",53
NA,at the principal ports of Papua and the,53
NA,dated Territory. Any service offered as a re-,53
NA,sult of such an advertisement will be,53
NA,sidered as an alternative to the present,53
NA,"vices, which make the Territories terminal",53
NA,ports.,53
NA,I interpret that statement to mean that,53
NA,"the Government intends ,to offer to the",53
NA,"Nippon Yusen Kaisha line, of Japan,",53
NA,"and the E . and A . line of China, and",53
NA,"other shipping lines a subsidy, to engage",53
NA,in the island trade. Such a policy will,53
NA,not find favour with the people of,53
NA,"Australia, or the people who are",53
NA,SUBSIDY-,53
NA,interested i n the development of Aus-,53
NA,tralian trade w i t h Papua and New,53
NA,Guinea. The whole tenor of the pub-,53
NA,lished statement is that the present ser-,53
NA,vice is unsatisfactory. The existing mail,53
NA,NEWS-,53
NA,"contract, was investigated by the Naviga-",53
NA,tion Commission when i t visited Papua,53
NA,"and New Guinea, and its report was",53
NA,tabled i n this House twelve months ago.,53
NA,I am not so much concerned i n defend-,53
NA,"ing Burns, Philp and Company as i n",53
NA,"the ensuring that an Australian company,",53
NA,employing white labour - upon Australian,53
NA,shall be continued in,53
NA,"this trade; but that company has, un-",53
NA,"doubtedly, a legitimate grievance against",53
NA,"the Government, because of its delay",53
NA,finalizing the contract. I n Sep-,53
NA,"tember, 1924, tenders were invited f o r",53
NA,"this service, returnable on the 15th",53
NA,"1925. Burns, P h i l p and",53
NA,"with which Company wore, I understand, the only",53
NA,"to tenderers, and the amount of their tender",53
NA,was subsequently published i n the press.,53
NA,this How and why the information was dis-,53
NA,"Goclosed, the Government professes not to",53
NA,but i t was unfair to the company,53
NA,the amount of the tender should,53
NA,"have been allowed to leak out. Again,",53
NA,"the 8th October, 1925, the Govern-",53
NA,lasment called for tenders which closed on,53
NA,"the 30th November last. Since that date,",53
NA,I nothing has been done by the Govern-,53
NA,"ment, but Burns, P h i l p and Company",53
NA,e has been asked to carry on the service,53
NA,by temporary extensions of the contract.,53
NA,the complaint that the Pacific mail,53
NA,service has been unsatisfactory the com-,53
NA,reply is that the delay of the Go-,53
NA,vernment i n declaring its policy has pre-,53
NA,cluded i t from acquiring new ships to,53
NA,"improve the service. I f that is so, the",53
NA,Government's unbusinesslike methods,53
NA,offers are responsible for any complaints,53
NA,Apparently,53
NA,the purpose of the Government i n defer-,53
NA,ring its decision is to induce other com-,53
NA,Manpanies to enter into this trade. The ap-,53
NA,conplication of the Navigation Act to New,53
NA,serGuinea and Papua was suspended last,53
NA,"year, i n face of the bitterest opposition",53
NA,"f r o m this side of the House, .but de-",53
NA,spite that inducement no foreign com-,53
NA,panies have attempted to enter this trade.,53
NA,"Therefore, I suspect that the Government",53
NA,is offering to some foreign company special,53
NA,inducements to establish a service between,53
NA,AustraUa and the islands. The retention,53
NA,of an Australian-con trolled service is,54
NA,vital importance to the defence of,54
NA,"tralia, and having regard to the fact",54
NA,that our Pacific possessions are costing,54
NA,the Commonwealth a . large,54
NA,every year f o r administration and ment,54
NA,the maintenance of shipping,54
NA,"mail facilities, Australia is",54
NA,entitled to the major portion of the trade,54
NA,withthem. Although i t may be advisable,54
NA,'to develop the Eastern markets,54
NA,"products of Papua and New Guinea, we",54
NA,must not lose sight of the fact that,54
NA,Australian service is necessary i n order,54
NA,hold our share of the trade. A t the pretion,54
NA,"sent time the service maintained by Burns,",54
NA,Philp and Company means tbe expendithis,54
NA,ture in Australia upon repairs and stores,54
NA,"of, approximately, £100,000 per annum,",54
NA,whilst the annual value of cargoes car-,54
NA,ried to and from the mainland is about,54
NA,"£2.000,000. The wages paid, to",54
NA,"tralian seamen represent £87,000 per",54
NA,"annum. I f , owing to the Government's",54
NA,failure to continue the subsidy for a defihave,54
NA,"nite period, the company withdraws",54
NA,"service, the Commonwealth will lose a",54
NA,substantia] sum of money that is now,54
NA,"spent here, and many men w i l l be thrown",54
NA,"out of. work. Moreover, Burns, P h i",54
NA,and Company may be compelled by conditions,54
NA,competition and economic pressure to,54
NA,"their ships with coloured labour, and",54
NA,dreds of white Australians will be thrown,54
NA,out of employment. I t is for them I am,54
NA,principally concerned because of the,54
NA,sent state of the labour market. I havo,54
NA,received a protest f r o m certain marine,54
NA,transport unions interested in the trade centralization I strongly deprecate.,54
NA,against any such action on the part of have,54
NA,the Government. They point out that,54
NA,addition to throwing hundreds of men that,54
NA,out o f work the termination of the,54
NA,"tract will mean a direct loss of £150,000",54
NA,now expended i n Australia each year,54
NA,for repairs to ships and other incidentals.,54
NA,There is no excuse f or the Government's,54
NA,delaying of its decision f or over twelve,54
NA,months. I t has had ample time to arrive,54
NA,at a decision. I t is not f a i r that,54
NA,"Burns, Philp and Company should island",54
NA,be kept in suspense; and I hope,54
NA,that before the Government disconcargoes,54
NA,tinues the subsidy-i f that is its,54
NA,"intention-i t will, give its supporters an export trade.",54
NA,opportunity to consider whether thac,54
NA,"course will be wise, or fraught with",54
NA,aster and loss to Australia. The,54
NA,"pany, which I approached unofficially for",54
NA,of confirmation of the information I have,54
NA,"Ausgiven to the House, has, I understand,",54
NA,told the Government that i t realizes that,54
NA,the present service can be improved. I t,54
NA,sum is prepared to improve i t i f the Govern-,54
NA,"will be business-like, and indicate its",54
NA,and intentions in regard to the subsidy.,54
NA,surely U n t i l the company knows what the Go-,54
NA,"vernment proposes to do, i t w i l l not i n -",54
NA,cur additional expenditure i n connexion,54
NA,for the with the Pacific services.,54
Dr NOTT ,Herbert) [ 9 . 1 3 ] - I am,54
NA,an very pleased . that the honorable member,54
NA,to for Reid ( Mr Coleman) has drawn atten-,54
NA,to the condition of the island shipping,54
NA,services. I have previously referred to,54
NA,"matter in the House, and have been",54
NA,awaiting an announcement of the Govern-,54
NA,ment's intention in regard to the con-,54
NA,tinuation or termination of the existing,54
NA,"Ausagreement with Burns, Philp and Com-",54
NA,pany. I have discussed the matter with,54
NA,"the managers of the company, and they",54
NA,made i t clear to me that the existing,54
NA,its uncertainty as to the Government's,54
NA,policy prevents them f r o m instituting a,54
NA,thoroughly efficient service. The com-,54
NA,pany is prepared to improve the service,54
NA,"l p in any way desired, but under existing",54
NA,i t is not prepared to incur the,54
NA,man expense of putting new ships into com-,54
NA,hunmission. This Parliament has from time,54
NA,to time passed measures f o r the develop-,54
NA,"ment of Papua, and quite recently I heard",54
NA,prea suggestion that some of the Papuan,54
NA,trade might with advantage be deviated,54
NA,as f a r south as Melbourne. A l l effort at,54
NA,I,54
NA,"no animus against Burns,",54
NA,i n Philp and Company. For 40 years,54
NA,company has pioneered the,54
NA,"conEastern and Pacific trade, and, there-",54
NA,"fore, i t is entitled to consideration com-",54
NA,mensurate with the services i t has ren-,54
NA,dered. I should like the Government to,54
NA,increase the existing subsidy to such an,54
NA,extent as would offer an inducement to,54
NA,"Burns, P h i l p and Company to make",54
NA,Townsville the terminal port f o r the,54
NA,services. AU the facilities needed,54
NA,"for handling deep-sea ships, and large",54
NA,"are already available at that port,",54
NA,which would be an excellent base f o r tbe,54
NA,I f Townsville were made,54

NA,- I wish to bring under the notice of,55
NA,honorable the Postmaster-General ( Mr action desired.,55
NA,Gibson) certain matters connected w i,55
NA,wireless broadcasting. There seems to be lows :-,55
NA,a likelihood of the broadcasting business,55
NA,"in this State being monopolized by one The Secretary,",55
NA,company. The Postmaster-General has,55
NA,already said that his department is alert,55
NA,"i n the matter and does not intend to Dear Sir,",55
NA,"allow a broadcasting monopoly, but, notview",55
NA,"withstanding that assurance, suspicious",55
NA,movements are afoot. I wish to place,55
NA,"all my cards on the table, so that the Ltd., 3LO.",55
NA,"Minister, i n any investigation that he was",55
NA,"may make, w i l l have a knowledge of all",55
NA,the facts obtainable. Prom a man who Listener,55
NA,"is well-known i n the wireless world, and",55
NA,"who seems to know the facts, I have republished",55
NA,ceived the following letter relating to the,55
NA,"proposed sale, or swallowing up, of the",55
NA,3AR Broadcasting Company,55
Mr GIBSON ,Thi s matter is before the,55
NA,courts at the present time. I think there,55
NA,is a case arising out of the letter referred,55
NA,to by the honorable member.,55

Mr SEABROOK ,Franklin) [9.24] -,56
NA,"A t Huonville, i n my electorate, there is",56
NA,"a very small post office, which was built",56
NA,over 40 years ago. The accommodation,56
NA,there for the staff is very cramped. A,56
NA,piece of ground was purchased by the de-,56
NA,"partment for the erection of a new office,",56
NA,the building of which I urge the Post-,56
NA,master-General to expedite. The,56
NA,sent office is situated i n a growment,56
NA,"ing district, and its staff has to handle",56
NA,the mails of outlying parts. I t was built,56
NA,at a time when residences were i n,56
NA,"cluded i n post offices, and as a result",56
NA,greater part of the building is now used,56
NA,as a residence.,56
NA,I have another complaint to make,56
NA,about the post office at Sorell. Land,56
NA,was purchased for a new office there over,56
NA,twelve months ago. The residence,56
NA,which the post office was previously,56
NA,"located was sold, and the office has been",56
NA,"moved to another residence, where the",56
NA,only accommodation available f o r the,56
NA,transaction of postal business is a veranto,56
NA,"dah, covered over the f r o n t with glass.",56
NA,The district should have an official office.,56
NA,The department ought not to expect its,56
NA,servants to work i n conditions such,56
NA,exist at that office. When the depart-,56
NA,ment knew that the residence i n which,56
NA,the post office was previously situated had,56
NA,"been sold, i t should have started the",56
NA,building of the proposed new office at,56
NA,once.,56
NA,"Some time ago, I asked the Treasurer",56
NA,(Dr Earle Page) a question relating to,56
NA,the Commonwealth Bank building at first,56
NA,Hobart. H i s answer was that the matter,56
NA,"had nothing to do with him, but conof",56
NA,cerned only the board of directors of the another station.,56
NA,[136],56
NA,bank. When an honorable member venti-,56
NA,"lates such a grievance i n this House,",56
NA,which is the only place where he can,56
NA,"ventilate i t , i t is the duty of the Govern-",56
NA,ment to bring i t before the directors of,56
NA,"JOURNALS PTY. LTU., the bank. The bank building at Hobart",56
NA,is 70 years old. The Commonwealth,56
NA,"bought i t cheaply, but has spent a lot",56
NA,of money extending its scanty accommo-,56
NA,dation. The money that is being spent,56
NA,on this old building is virtually thrown,56
NA,away. A city like Hobart is entitled to,56
NA,a much better building f o r the accommo-,56
NA,dation of the Commonwealth Bank. The,56
NA,"building is i n the centre of the town,",56
NA,"next to the post office, and arrangements",56
NA,could be made to conduct the bank busi-,56
NA,ness i n the post office building during the,56
NA,erection of the new building. Many,56
NA,country towns have far better bank,56
NA,buildings than that which houses the,56
NA,"Commonwealth Bank i n Hobart, and I",56
NA,hope that the Government will very,56
NA,shortly erect a new building for i t -,56
NA,NA,56
NA,- I should like the Postmaster-General to,56
NA,preannounce the intention of the Govern-,56
NA,in regard to broadcasting wave,56
NA,lengths. A t present many listeners-in i n,56
NA,Sydney complain that i t is impossible f or,56
NA,- them to hear 3LO when 2 BL station is,56
NA,"the operating, and Melbourne people com-",56
NA,plain that they cannot hear 2 BL when,56
NA,3LO is operating. The wave lengths i n,56
NA,Australia come within a narrow band,56
NA,"and i t is most difficult, unless one has an",56
NA,"excellent receiving set, to listen-in to the",56
NA,i n desired station. I understand that the,56
NA,department takes the view that as,56
NA,"listeners-in pay only one fee, they are",56
NA,entitled to listen-in to only one station;,56
NA,but that unsatisfactory position will need,56
NA,be vastly improved before broadcasting,56
NA,can become as popular as i t ought to be,56
NA,in a sparsely populated country of wide,56
NA,distances such as this is. I have been,56
NA,as informed that the number of wireless,56
NA,.broadcasting licences i n New South Wales,56
NA,has decreased considerably i n the last,56
NA,"twelve months, and that is not as i t should",56
NA,be. More licences have been issued i n,56
NA,Victoria i n proportion to its population,56
NA,than i n any other State. I t should be,56
NA,possible to provide wave lengths that,56
NA,could be selected on an ordinary set with-,56
NA,out difficulty. Even listeners-in who have,56
NA,"class sets find i t difficult, unless they",56
NA,"are experts, to listen i n to the programme",56
NA,their choice without interruptions from,56
NA,Mr . GIBSON -Selectivit y does hot de-,57
NA,pend upon the number of valves.,57
NA,NA,57
NA,but the position could be greatly i m -,57
NA,proved. A few months ago a cohierence,57
NA,of wireless experts i n Sydney decided to,57
NA,ask the Government to appoint a royal,57
NA,commission to inquire into the whole mat-,57
NA,ter of broadcasting in Australia. I should,57
NA,like the Postmaster-General to intimate,57
NA,the decision of the Government on that,57
NA,matter. Country newspaper proprietors i n,57
NA,"New South Wales, and I suppose i n the",57
NA,"other States also, feel that they have a",57
NA,"grievance, because they are prohibited by",57
NA,certain wireless regulations from installing,57
NA,receiving sets i n their offices. I t often,57
NA,pens that news of public importance is,57
NA,known i n country towns by means of wire-,57
NA,less long before the country - newspaper,57
NA,offices receive i t by telegraph or telephone.,57
NA,I understand that the department takes,57
NA,the view that i f the newspaper offices,57
NA,were allowed to install receiving sets the,57
NA,telegraph and telephone revenue would,57
NA,suffer considerably; but I am afraid that,57
NA,we must face that loss. We might just as,57
NA,reasonably prohibit people from travelling,57
NA,by motor on the ground that i t reduces,57
NA,"the railway revenue, as prohibit news-",57
NA,paper proprietors from using the wireless,57
NA,on the ground that i t reduces the tele-,57
NA,phone and telegraph revenue. W i t h all,57
NA,due respect to the Postmaster-General,57
NA,"f Mr Gibson), I say that i t is folly to",57
NA,prevent our people from making the f u l -,57
NA,lest possible use of wireless. I trust that,57
NA,the Postmaster-General will indicate the,57
NA,attitude of the Government on these mat-,57
NA,ters.,57
Mr GIBSON ,Corangamite - Postlaw,57
NA,master-General) [9.35] -Th e department,57
NA,"is unableto meet the wishes of menced,",57
NA,the honorable member for Franklin,57
NA,( Mr Seabrook) i n regard to allowthe,57
NA,"ance post offices, where the business",57
NA,is carried on in private premises.,57
NA,many instances the department pays,57
NA,more for the service that is rendered than,57
NA,i t receives through the offices.,57
NA,is to establish allowauce post offices,57
NA,throughout the length and breadth of,57
NA,"country, so that the postal service",57
NA,people may be as efficient as possible.,57
NA,Honorable members who have travelled i,57
NA,Great Britain will bear me out when I,57
NA,say. that very few post office,57
NA,"to be seen there, for practically the whole",57
NA,of the operations of the postal departnouncing,57
NA,ment are carried on i n private business,57
NA,premises; but the people -have their mail,57
NA,delivered threeor four times a day even,57
NA,in the country districts. We have about,57
NA,"7,000 allowance post offices i n the Com-",57
NA,"monwealth,' but i t is most difficult to get",57
NA,people to maintain some of them. They,57
NA,tell us sometimes that the office consists,57
NA,"of only a mailbag and a date stamp, and",57
NA,that they feel like throwing them out of,57
NA,the window.,57
NA,"I am hopeful that, i n the near future,",57
NA,i t will be possible to provide automatic,57
NA,post offices i n many country centres. I n,57
NA,"the meantime, an automatic post office is",57
NA,operating f o r Gippsland districts with,57
NA,hapgreat success. I t is situated next to a,57
NA,"school, the mistress of which had not",57
NA,"time to sort the mail, and the people",57
NA,come along and collect their letters when,57
NA,they please. I f that arrangement is,57
NA,"generally adopted, the practice w i l l be",57
NA,to sort mail matter i n the post offices and,57
NA,deposit i t i n the boxes of people within the,57
NA,"district by the mail contractor, so that",57
NA,"they may collect i t at any hour tbey like,",57
NA,"on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, as",57
NA,well as on ordinary week days.,57
NA,I am also hopeful that i t will be pos-,57
NA,"sible, i n the near future, to establish an",57
NA,automatic telephone service in country,57
NA,districts. Two of our engineers have been,57
NA,working on a scheme for six months which,57
NA,they have high hopes will be completely,57
NA,successful. I cannot say any more on,57
NA,that point just now.,57
NA,The honorable member for Maribyr-,57
NA,nong ( Mr Fenton) expressed fears that,57
NA,"there will be a monopoly of "" A "" class",57
NA,wireless stations. I understand that a,57
NA,"case affecting "" A "" class stations is",57
NA,"pending, i f i t has not been actually com-",57
NA,so the least said on that question,57
NA,at present the better. But I can assure,57
NA,honorable member that there is no,57
NA,"fear of a monopoly occurring, for the de-",57
NA,I n partment not only controls the pro-,57
NA,"grammes that are broadcast, but also",57
NA,"allocates the revenue, in accordance with",57
NA,I t s policy the programmes presented.,57
Mr FENTON ,Bu t is not a monopoly,57
NA,the -likely to occur when one broadcasting,57
NA,to the company can buy.out another?,57
Mr GIBSON ,N o monopoly need be,57
NA,n feared while the department controls the,57
NA,"programmes, and allocates the revenue i n",57
NA,buildings are accordance with them.,57
NA,I appreciate the desirableness of an-,57
NA,wireless programmes as early,57
NA,"as possible, and will go as f a r as I can",57
NA,to meet the wishes of the honorable mem-,58
NA,ber in that respect. Programmes should,58
NA,be available to the public at least a week,58
NA,in advance. Although many people may,58
NA,not desire to listen to racing and other,58
NA,"sporting results, thev may be very i n -",58
NA,terested i n some other matter that is to,58
NA,"be broadcast, so i t is desirable to fix the",58
NA,time at which specific matter will be,58
NA,broadcast.,58
NA,I t appears that the mantle qf Sir,58
NA,"Austin Chapman has, i n very t r u t h ,",58
NA,fallen upon the shoulders of .his successor,58
NA,NA,58
NA,already displayed that keen interest i n,58
NA,postal matters which distinguished his,58
NA,"predecessor, and now he"" is taking u p the",58
NA,cudgels on behalf of listeners-in.,58
NA,"matters he referred to are important,",58
NA,but difficult to deal with. The majority,58
NA,of the wireless sets manufactured,58
NA,in Great Britain and the United States,58
NA,of America are sufficiently selective to,58
NA,take twelve wave lengths between the,58
NA,"limits of 2 BL and 3 AB , and then can",58
NA,"cut out eleven of them, so that any one",58
NA,"may be heard distinctly; but, unfortu-",58
NA,"nately, many of those manufactured i n",58
NA,Australia are not selective enough to,58
NA,separate 2 BL f r o m the Melbourne,58
NA,station. During J u ly the,58
NA,ment willbe inquiring into,58
NA,"whole of the wireless regulations, and will",58
NA,make a close study of the wave lengths.,58
NA,The difficulty i n disturbing the present,58
NA,arrangements is that i t may compel a,58
NA,great many listeners-in to purchase new,58
NA,receiving sets and alterations to broad-,58
NA,casting equipment. Only between 20 and 30,58
NA,"per cent, of the listeners-in i n Australia",58
NA,use valve sets; so that a comparatively,58
NA,small number experience any disturbance.,58
NA,I assure the honorable member that,58
NA,the Government will give careful,58
NA,consideration - to the whole position.,58
NA,Broadcasting i n Australia is not i n the,58
NA,condition which the honorable member,58
NA,would suggest. I t is probably i n a more,58
NA,favorable position here than i t is i n any,58
NA,other country. The honorable member,58
NA,referred to a conference held i n New,58
NA,South Wales. I t was a conference of men,58
NA,"associated with wireless, who had held a",58
NA,previous conference i n Melbourne.,58
NA,"opened the conference held in Melbourne,",58
NA,which represented the whole of the i n -,58
NA,terests of the wireless associations of Aus-,58
NA,tralia. The conference was instrumental,58
NA,"in fixing certain conditions, including",58
NA,"wave lengths round 1,000 metres, and",58
NA,was unanimous. When concluding,58
NA,"the conference, I said that I was asr",58
NA,tonished that i t should have come to that,58
NA,"conclusion, and that the responsibility",58
NA,"for i t , i f i t were a failure, would be",58
NA,upon its shoulders. I t was a failure. N o,58
NA,"one would accept the sealed sets, and re-",58
NA,ceiving sets of the long wave lengths.,58
NA,Broadcasting has been i n operation i n,58
NA,"Australia f o r something like two years,",58
NA,and the whole progress of the business,58
NA,"has been, generally, satisfactory. The",58
NA,position with which we are confronted to-,58
NA,day is that every one is endeavouring to,58
NA,"listen i n , not only to stations i n their",58
NA,"own States, but to stations i n other States.",58
NA,"The There is no harm i n that, and the Go-",58
NA,"vernment does not object to i t , but we say'",58
NA,that the licence issued to those 'having,58
NA,receiving sets is for listening in to the sta-,58
NA,tions i n their own States. They t r y to,58
NA,listen i n not merely to stations i n their,58
NA,"own States, but to those i n other States,",58
NA,"in Java, and i n almost every country i n",58
NA,the world. I agree w i t h the honorable,58
NA,member that we cannot stand still i n this,58
NA,"business, but must march with the times.",58
NA,W i t h regard to a broadcasting service f o r,58
NA,"the country press, i f we find that the",58
NA,"depart- telegraph is obsolete, we must scrap the",58
NA,"the telegraph, and must adopt more modern",58
NA,methods for the transmission of news.,58
NA,"If we attempt that unlikely step,",58
NA,there is a difficulty i n the way.,58
NA,"The whole, of the news is copy-",58

NA,and cannot be used by the coun-,58
NA,"try press, except by arrangement with",58
NA,those ' newspapers. Broadcast news,58

Mr MARR ,Parkes-Honorar y Minis-,58
NA,ter) [9.47] - I wish to reply to some,58
NA,I comments by the honorable members f o r,58
NA,Reid ( Mr Coleman) and Herbert (Dr,58
NA,"N o tt), as to the alleged dilatoriness of",58
NA,the Government i n connexion with the,58
NA,shipping service to the islands and the,58
NA,Mandated Territories. I t has been con-,58
NA,tended that the Government intends to,58
NA,enter into contracts w i th companies em-,59
NA,"ploying Lascars, Chinese and other",59
NA,coloured seamen. The Government has no,59
NA,intention to do anything of the sort. I t,59
NA,was stated that the Government had been,59
NA,"permitting Burns, Philp and Company",59
NA,to carry on the service f r o m month to,59
NA,month. The contract w i th that company,59
NA,"expired on the 31st July, 1925. Prior",59
NA,to that the Government had called for,59
NA,fresh tenders f o r the carrying on of the,59
NA,"service, but those received were not satis-",59
NA,"factory. Burns, P h i l p and Company",59
NA,were then asked to continue to carry on,59
NA,"the work f o r a further six months, which",59
NA,"expired at the end of February last, when",59
NA,the Government again called f o r tenders.,59
NA,I t has been admitted that the ser-,59
NA,vice ' is not satisfactorily carried out.,59
NA,That was reported by a committee,59
NA,"of this Parliament, notwithstanding",59
NA,the fact that Burns P h i l p and,59
NA,Company have been carrying on the,59
NA,service f o r 30 or 40 years. The Govern-,59
NA,ment asked that company to carry on the,59
NA,"work f or a furthe r six mnoths, which ex-",59
NA,pires on the 31st July next. We are told,59
NA,that the company is prepared to put on,59
NA,better ships i f i t is given a higher subsidy.,59
NA,The company has had a monopoly of the,59
NA,"service f o r years, and has received a con-",59
NA,siderable amount i n subsidies.,59
NA,claim that the people of Australia are,59
NA,entitled to a fair return for the money-,59
NA,paid to the company carrying on this,59
NA,"service, and as the honorable, members to",59
NA,"whom I have referred have said, the",59
NA,people i n the islands and i n the Man-,59
NA,dated Territories and Papua demand a,59
NA,better service than they are receiving at,59
NA,the present time. The Government have,59
NA,called tenders for the service with a de-,59
NA,sire to secure the best service possible.,59
NA,The honorable member f o r Beid said that,59
NA,the Government was approaching a,59
NA,"Japanese company. As ,a matter of fact,",59
NA,"i t has approached no company, beyond",59
NA,"asking Burns, Phil p and Company to",59
NA,continue to carry on the service tem-,59
NA,porarily. I t has called f or tenders two,59
NA,"or three times i n the press, and i t is open",59
NA,to any company to send i n a tender. I t,59
NA,is merely camouflage to suggest that the,59
NA,service is likely to be withdrawn. I do,59
NA,"not believe that Burns, Philp and Com-",59
NA,pany can afford to withdraw fro m the,59
NA,island trade.,59

NA,orable members are aware that ships of,59
NA,"all nations, no matter what the colour of",59
NA,"their crews, carry our mails on the",59
NA,poundage basis. I f we can give the Man-,59

NA,carriage of mails and cargo we shall be,59
NA,i n a position to give greater satisfaction,59
NA,to the League of Nations i n our admin-,59

NA,"the tariff for the islands, and the supply of",59
NA,"a shipping service, and i n this connexion",59
NA,the operation of the Navigation A c t has,59

NA,members will admit that the Govern-,59
NA,ment is sincere i n its desire to do what,59
NA,is best i n the interests of the islands and,59
NA,the Mandated Territories. I n calling for,59

Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,Calare-Min,60

NA,move-,60
NA,That the bill be now read a second time.,60
NA,This is a b i l l to appropriate from the,60
NA,Consolidated Revenue Fund an amount,60
NA,"£1,000,000 for the defence equipment",60
NA,f u n d which was established i n 1924,60
NA,give effect to the naval,60
NA,"ton policy, and an amount of £250,000",60
NA,for air purposes. Honorable mem-,60
NA,bers will remember that i n 1924 the,60
NA,defence policy of the country was consibly,60
NA,sidered and a definite programme agreed,60
NA,"upon, to be completed i n 1928-29. The",60
NA,money to be appropriated under this bill,60
NA,is required to f u l f i l i n part the,60
NA,ments entered into at that time.,60
NA,defence of Australia is based on the,60
NA,nite principle that each dominion of the,60
NA,British Empire shall prepare its own,60
NA,"home defence, and a second very imof",60
NA,portant principle that all expenditure,60
NA,carrying out a construction policy shall,60
NA,be paid out of revenue. The sum of have,60
NA,"£1,000,000 is required to assist i n meetemployment fo r our own people.",60
NA,"ing the commitment of £7,000,000 for the",60
NA,construction policy entered into.,60
Mr CHARLTON ,Whic h includes,60
NA,"cruisers, and what else ?",60
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE , I t includes,60
NA,the cruisers and submarines for 1926-27.,60
NA,"and £586,520 towards the cost of the",60
NA,plane carrier which is being built at ox,60
NA,Cockatoo Island dockyard. I t is estimated tion.,60
NA,that the total cost of the construction,60
NA,the seaplane carrier will amount,60
NA,"£1,300,000. I have said that an appromarket",60
NA,"priation of £250,000 is required for a deprimary industries.",60
NA,fence fund for air purposes. Honorable,60
NA,members will recognize that since the,60
NA,HOWS E) fence policy was laid down i n 1924 the,60
NA,whole idea of the air service necessary to,60
NA,co-operate with the sister defence services,60
NA,has altered. Every strategist now,60
NA,lays i t down that the air service,60
NA,should be increased fivefold beyond what,60
NA,"was considered necessary i n 1924,",60
NA,and that no forward action by an army,60
NA,or navy should be begun without very,60
NA,careful reconnaissance. W i t h the object,60
NA,of commencing this very necessary por-,60
NA,"tion of our defence system, the work of",60
NA,building a seaplane carrier has been,60
NA,taken i n hand. I t is estimated that by,60
NA,the use of a seaplane carrier equipped,60
NA,"with modern seagulls and amphibions, a",60
NA,radius of 400 to 500 miles is added to,60
NA,the range of any naval defence force.,60
NA,- I need not weary the House by going,60
NA,I into the details of every item of expen-,60
NA,diture. I t is recognized that an enor-,60
NA,mous advance has been made in recent,60
NA,"years i n air service, and the Government",60
NA,of has decided to commence building up,60
NA,this branch of its defence forces by,60
NA,to setting aside an additional amount of,60
NA,"construc- £250,000 as a trust f u n d fo r the purpose.",60
Mr CHARLTON ,Hunter) [ 1 0 . 1 ] - I,60
NA,recognize that -with the exception pos-,60
NA,"of the £250,000 f o r the A i r Force,",60
NA,the money the House is asked to appro-,60
NA,priate to-night is f o r work that has al-,60
NA,ready been authorized by Parliament. I t,60
NA,"commitis, therefore, useless at this stage to",60
NA,The criticize the defence policy of the Go-,60
NA,defivernment. But I may be pardoned f o r,60
NA,stating once more that the Labour party,60
NA,"exceedingly regrets that about £500,000",60
NA,the money the House is now asked to,60
NA,in appropriate is for naval construction,60
NA,abroad. I t is money that could very well,60
NA,been spent i n Australia i n providing,60
NA,We,60
NA,have quite a. number of persons i n every,60
NA,State who are unable to get work.,60
NA,the Among .them are artisans who are,60
NA,capable of doing the work of,60
NA,building cruisers. The policy of sending,60
NA,overseas to have work done f o r us w i l l,60
NA,"seanever make Australia self-contained,",60
NA,help to increase our popula-,60
NA,We cannot hope to absorb i m m i-,60
NA,of grants unless we build up secondary i n -,60
NA,to dustries which will provide a local,60
NA,fo r those who are engaged i n,60
NA,As the seaplane,60
NA,"carrier is to be built at Cockatoo Island,",60
NA,"dethe £500,000 we are asked to set aside",60
NA,towards the cost of its construction w i l l,61
NA,be of considerable benefit to Australians.,61
NA,But i t is hard to realize that i t is the,61
NA,policy of an Australian Government to,61
NA,"spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 overseas",61
NA,for cruisers while at the same time i t is,61
NA,having certain naval work done i n its,61
NA,own dockyard. I t is well known that we,61
NA,can build cruisers here just as well as,61
NA,they can be built i n any other part of,61
NA,the world.,61
NA,Mr G. FBANCIS -Yes ; but at what,61
NA,cost?,61
Mr CHARLTON , T h e question of,61
NA,cost should not be taken too much into,61
NA,consideration. Wages are high i n Aus-,61
NA,"tralia, and we cannot expect to build",61
NA,vessels as cheaply as they can be built,61
NA,abroad. I f the honorable member ap-,61
NA,plied his policy to everything we use there,61
NA,would be no work done in Australia.,61
Mr G , FRANCIS - I merely wanted to,61
NA,know at what cost the cruisers could be,61
NA,built i n Australia.,61
Mr CHARLTON , T h e fact that i t,61
NA,costs more to build the cruisers in Aus-,61
NA,tralia than abroad is no justification,61
NA,for having the work done abroad,61
NA,if we are anxious to advance Australia;,61
NA,and to say that the cost of this class of,61
NA,work in Australia should only equal the,61
NA,cost overseas in tantamount to saying that,61
NA,Australian workmen should be brought,61
NA,dowu to the level of workmen abroad.,61
NA,For the future advancement of Aus-,61
NA,"tralia, we ought to keep our wages and",61
NA,working conditions on a very high,61
NA,plane. They ought to be better here,61
NA,"than elsewhere. I n other words, we",61
NA,"ought to lead the world i n such matters,",61
NA,but this we can do only by providing,61
NA,employment f o r our own people - The,61
NA,great majority of the citizens of Australia,61
NA,would not complain about having to find,61
NA,money to have work done i n the Common-,61
NA,wealth i f i t would lead to their advance-,61
NA,ment. I question very much i f i t would,61
NA,not be a better proposition i n the long,61
NA,run to pay more f o r building tbe ships i n,61
NA,Australia than to have them built abroad.,61
NA,I t would provide work not only f o r the,61
NA,men directly employed i n constructing,61
NA,"the vessels, but also f o r many others i n",61
NA,"handling the raw material, and f o r",61
NA,business people i n supplying the require-,61
NA,monts of the men directly employed on,61
NA,construction. The State would derive,61
NA,income tax f r o m all who were engaged,61
NA,"in the work of construction, and the",61
NA,Customs revenue derivable f r o m the con-,61
NA,sumers at large would be considerably,61
NA,increased. A proper comparison cannot,61
NA,really be.instituted unless every aspect of,61
NA,the question is taken into consideration.,61
NA,"I believe that, i f that were done, the",61
NA,figures would show the advantage of,61
NA,having the work done i n Australia. I t is,61
NA,idle f o r us to talk about bringing immi-,61
NA,grants here i f we cannot find employment,61
NA,"for our own people. However, as Parlia-",61
NA,ment has already decided to have',61
NA,these cruisers built i n Great Britain .,61
NA,I have no desire to reopen a discussion,61
NA,upon the question. I think the Go-,61
NA,vernment is doing right i n building,61
NA,up our air force. I regret the necessity,61
NA,"for a defence system, but, as very little",61
NA,progress is being made towards disarma-,61
NA,"ment, I think we should 'have an efficient",61
NA,air force. I t will prove to be the most,61
NA,important branch of our defence system,61
NA,should i t ever be necessary f o r us to,61
NA,defend our shores. The Labour party,61
NA,"believes i n air defence. Quite recently,",61
NA,when we were dealing with thc defence,61
NA,"policy of the Government, we were told",61
NA,in the press and on the public platfor m,61
NA,that the building up of an air force was,61
NA,not of very great moment so f a r as Aus-,61
NA,"tralia was concerned, and that f o r our",61
NA,defence we must depend entirely on our,61
NA,naval forces. I n order to show that there,61
NA,is some justification f o r the Labour,61
NA,party's adoption of the policy of having,61
NA,"an adequate air force, I quote a few",61
NA,authorities on the subject. The late,61
NA,Admira l Sir Percy Scott said-,61
NA,Australia's line of defence was obviously,61
NA,"aeroplanes, submarines, and torpedo boats,",61
NA,against whicli no hostile fleet would dare,61
NA,approach within 200 miles.,61
NA,"Lord Fisher, on the 30th October, 1919,",61
NA,"in a letter to the"" Times, said-",61
NA,I t is as clear as daylight that the future of,61
NA,war on the sea absolutely precludes the use of,61
NA,any war vessel except submarines. . . . All,61
NA,wc want is the present naval side of the Air,61
NA,Force. . . . Submarines would make Aus-,61
NA,tralia impregnable.,61
NA,Brigadier-General T. H . Dodds says-,61
NA,"Australia must have tanks, fast motor trans-",61
NA,"port, anti-aircraft guns, and an enormous in-",61
NA,crease in aircraft.,61
NA,"I t is the opinion of Admir.al Kerr, of",61
NA,"the British Navy, that-",61
NA,The Australian line of defence is obviously,61
NA,"comprised of aeroplanes, submarines, and tor-",61
NA,pedo boats..,61
NA,Lieutenant - Commander Rawson,62
NA,clares-,62
NA,I t needs little technical knowledge to see,62
NA,"that Australia must concentrate on submarines,",62
NA,"mine-layers, fast torpedo boats, and aircraft.",62
NA,Sixteen submarines can be built for the price,62
NA,of one battleship.,62
NA,"Stanley Goble, Chief of the Australian",62
NA,"A i r Staff, says-",62
NA,The cost of equipment for air defence will,62
NA,"be £3,000,000-les s than the cost of one battle-",62
NA,ship. No progress has been made towards a,62
NA,definite policy of air defence.,62
NA,"Admiral Sims, of the ""United States",62
NA,"Navy, says-",62
NA,Had any enemy submarines been present in,62
NA,"April, 1915, the landing of troops on the Penin-",62
NA,sula would have been impossible.,62
NA,I n the Text Book of Militar y Aero-,62
NA,"nautics, two experts, Henry ""Woodhouse",62
NA,"and Clem Hawley, say-",62
NA,One of the principal uses of aircraft is,62
NA,prevent the landing of enemy forces by attack-,62
NA,ing the hostile ships and transports.,62
NA,An aerial service is one which can,62
NA,"used in times of peace to carry messages, into.",62
NA,"mails, or goods to the remote parts of the",62
NA,Commonwealth. Therefore i t serves,62
NA,double purpose. Time w i l l not permit,62
NA,me this evening to make a statement i,62
NA,regard to the defence policy of the Labour,62
NA,"party, but the opinions I have just",62
NA,indicate that its policy of having an,62
NA,adequate A i r Force is supported by,62
NA,"of standing, who declare that i t is the",62
NA,"best line of defence f o r Australia. But,",62
NA,while I support the establishment of an,62
NA,"A i r Force, I regret the action of the",62
NA,vernment in building cruisers overseas.,62
NA,I f i t is the Government's policy to build,62
NA,"cruisers i n preference to aeroplanes, tor-",62
NA,"pedoes, and submarines, the work of con-",62
NA,struction should be carried out i n Ausseaplane,62
NA,"tralia. We have here the men, the dockIsland,",62
NA,"yard, and everything requisite f or the",62
NA,"building of cruisers, and the work should'",62
NA,"be done in our own country, giving em-",62
NA,"ployment to our own people, assisting to",62
NA,"populate the Commonwealth, and pro-",62
NA,viding employment f or the immigrants,62
NA,we may desire to bring here. But. i t is,62
NA,"idle to debate that issue now, because the",62
NA,House has already authorized the buildplane,62
NA,"i n "" of cruisers overseas. The only",62
NA,"proposal i t i the bil l before us is to estab- £500,000.",62
NA,"lish an A i r Force, and as i t is part of the",62
NA,Labour party's platform to have a n A i r,62
NA,"Force i n Australia, I can offer no objec-",62
NA,de- tion to the bill. H ad the Labour party,62
NA,been returned to power at the last elec-,62
NA,"tion, i t would have taken steps to estab-",62
NA,lish an A i r Force and to make Australia,62
NA,self-contained in regard to its defence by,62
NA,providing factories that could easily be,62
NA,converted in time of war to the manu-,62
NA,facture of munitions.,62
Mr MANN ,Perth) [10.12] -I t is,62
NA,perfectly true that the general defence,62
NA,programme to extend over five years was,62
NA,submitted and tacitly approved by this,62
NA,House; but I think one is justified i n,62
NA,expressing regret that we have had,62
NA,so little information in regard to the,62
NA,large expenditure authorized by this bill.,62
NA,I t is not i n accord with what we have,62
NA,been led to expect from the Minister for,62
NA,Defence (Sjr Neville Howse). When he,62
NA,has been submitting estimates of expen-,62
NA,"diture, he has, as a rule, given most",62
NA,"to lucid, interesting, and f u l l explanations.",62
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,Thi s is not an,62
NA,estimate; i t is merely an appropriation,62
NA,be to meet a commitment already entered,62
Mr MANN , I t may be a commit-,62
NA,"a ment, but 1 am at a loss to understand",62
NA,just how far i t is a definite commitment.,62
NA,"n I f I remember rightly, when"" the five-",62
NA,year's programme was agreed to the Go-,62
NA,quoted vernment made the announcement that,62
NA,it would build a seaplane carrier in Aus-,62
NA,men tralia at a cost which was estimated to,62
NA,"be about £800,000. The Minister will",62
NA,doubtless correct me i f I am wrong.,62
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,Ther e was a ten-,62
NA,Gotative suggestion at that time that i t,62
NA,"would cost not less than £835,000.",62
Mr MANN ,Th e general impression,62
NA,honorable members formed was that,62
NA,"£800,000 would be about the cost of the",62
NA,carrier to be built at Cockatoo,62
NA,"but the Minister, in introducing",62
NA,"this bill to-night, has told us, in a some-'",62
NA,"what cursory manner, tbat i t includes an",62
NA,"amount of £586,000 for a seaplane car-",62
NA,"rier, the total cost of which is now esti-",62
NA,"mated to be £1,300,000. I ask the-",62
NA,Minister i f that is correct?,62
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE , I t is.,62
Mr MANN ," T n other words, tbe sea-",62
NA,carrier which was estimated to cost,62
NA,"new £800,000 is now likely to cost another",62
NA,Such a huge advance upon,62
NA,the original estimate calls for some ex-,62
NA,planation by the Minister -»,62
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE , I t was not a de-,62
NA,finite estimate.,62
NA,"Mr MANN "" - I t may not have been,",63
NA,but the House and the public were led,63
NA,to believe that the seaplane carrier would,63
NA,"cost about £835,000. Now we are told",63
NA,"that the cost w i l l be £500,000 more-",63
Mr WEST , A million pounds is not,63
NA,much.,63
Mr MANN ,Apparentl y the Com-,63
NA,monwealth is becoming so accustomed to,63
NA,playing the part of a Croesus that i t is,63
NA,prepared to throw millions of pounds,63
NA,"about here, there, and everywhere.",63
Mr CHARLTON , I consider that an,63
NA,increase of half a million pounds on the,63
NA,"original estimate is serious, and the House",63
NA,should be furnished w i th an explanation,63
NA,of i t . I did not hear the figures when,63
NA,the Minister was speaking.,63
Mr MANN , I submit that the Min-,63
NA,ister should explain how the increased,63
NA,cost has been arrived at. Have competi-,63
NA,"tive tendei's been invited, or reliable",63
NA,comparative estimates prepared by which,63
NA,the amount can be checked? I am not,63
NA,"opposed to a progressive defence policy,",63
NA,but the House is entitled to more detailed,63
NA,information than the Minister furnished.,63
NA,"Is £1,250,000 such an insignificant",63
NA,amount that we can pass i t i n a few,63
NA,minutes without any explanation?,63
NA,venture to say that honorable members,63
NA,are shocked at being asked to expend upon,63
NA,"a seaplane carrier £500,000 more than",63
NA,was originally estimated. Some honor-,63
NA,able members opposite seem not to,63
NA,mind how much things cost so long,63
NA,as the money is spent i n Australia. I,63
NA,agree with the Leader of the Opposition,63
NA,that the proposed development of the air,63
NA,"service is most advisable, but the country",63
NA,should have some assurance that i t is re-,63
NA,ceiving value f o r its money.,63
NA,must exist i n the department large re-,63
NA,sources of information upon which the,63
NA,Minister could have drawn f o r the,63
NA,enlightenment of the House.,63
NA,ferred to certain aeroplanes by name;,63
NA,he might have told us more of what is,63
NA,"intended to be done w i th this money, so",63
NA,that we should be qualified to record an,63
NA,intelligent vote upon the bill.,63
Mr MAHONY ,Dalley) [10.20] -Th e,63
NA,Minister for Defence failed to give to the,63
NA,House adequate information concerning,63
NA,"the proposed expenditure. For instance,",63
NA,he might have told us of the progress,63
NA,the construction of the cruisers overseas.,63
NA,When these vessels were under discussion,63
NA,"in the House i n 1925, the Prime Ministion",63
NA,"ter, i n combating the contention of myself",63
NA,and other honorable members on this side,63
NA,"of the House, that they should be built",63
NA,"i n Australia, said that time was of",63
NA,"the essence of the contract, and",63
NA,"that, i f the vessels were built i n",63
NA,"the Commonwealth, they could not",63
NA,be delivered w i t h in the contract period.,63
NA,W i l l the Minister tell us whether,63
NA,"the successful tenderer, John Brown and",63
NA,"Company, is proceeding with the work up",63
NA,"to schedule time, and whether the vessels",63
NA,will be delivered on the due date ? I am,63
NA,i n possession of certain information on,63
NA,"this subject, which suggests that the time",63
NA,condition of the contract is not now con-,63
NA,sidered so important as the Prime Minis-,63
NA,ter declared i t to be; but I shall refrain,63
NA,fro m disclosing what I have been told,63
NA,u n t i l the Minister has had an opportunity,63
NA,to give to the House further details.,63
NA,John Brown and Company obtained f r o m,63
NA,the Commonwealth Government a con-,63
NA,tract which will cost the taxpayers of,63
NA,"Australia over £4,000,000. W i t h that",63
NA,money work is being provided for people,63
NA,"thousands of miles away, while our",63
NA,own artisans are hopelessly looking for,63
NA,employment. How is the contract pro-,63
NA,gressing ? The committee is entitled to,63
NA,I knoAv also what payments have been made,63
NA,to John Brown and Company. I f we vote,63
NA,this money without any further explana-,63
NA,"tion, we are not guarding the finances of",63
NA,the country so jealously as the Treasurer,63
NA,urged us to do .before he became a M i n -,63
NA,ister of the Crown. I remember him,63
NA,"speaking of ""switching on the l i g h t """,63
NA,"and compelling certain persons to "" drop",63
NA,"the loot."" I t would be well i f the honor-",63
NA,able gentleman were as enthusiastic and,63
NA,energetic an advocate of economy as he,63
NA,There was when merely a private member. I,63
NA,remember the anxiety of ministerialists to,63
NA,examine the closest details of Australian,63
NA,"tenders i n order to ascertain whether, i f",63
NA,"H e re- the contract were let locally, the cruisers",63
NA,could - be delivered within the specified,63
NA,"time, and at the contract price. I would",63
NA,like those gentlemen to be equally curious,63
NA,about John Brown and Company's per-,63
NA,formance of its contracts. Has that firm,63
NA,done sufficient work to entitle i t to the,63

Mr MANNING ,Macquarie) [10.28].,63
NA,of -Thi s money is needed to meet commit-,63
NA,ments already entered into. We all re-,63
NA,cognize the important strides that avia-,63
NA,has made during the last few months.,63
NA,r,63
NA,and we have every reason to be proud of,64
NA,the work being done by Australian,64
NA,experimenters. Squadron - Commander,64
NA,"Wackett has produced an amphibian,",64
NA,which would be a credit to any country warships.,64
NA,in the world. I t is made entirely of,64
NA,Australian material. I am afraid that,64
NA,sufficient money is allowed our aviation,64
NA,engineers with which to test the suitthat.,64
NA,"ability of Australian timbers, and other",64
NA,local material for aeroplane purposes.,64
NA,know that these men have to scratch for,64
NA,every penny they expend in carrying on,64
NA,this most important research work. This,64
NA,bill will make money available for the,64
NA,"purchase, reconditioning, and equipment",64
NA,"of aircraft, and for other purposes,",64
NA,if the amount is not adequate to provide,64
NA,also for the experiments which are,64
NA,"such importance, i t should be i n -",64
NA,creased. The engineers should,64
NA,given every encouragement and astry.,64
NA,sistanceto continue the magnificent,64
NA,work i n which they are,64
NA,A t present they are hampered i n their,64
NA,experiments i n a way that is not,64
NA,i n the interests of the country.,64
NA,saw the Wackett machine make its not,64
NA,"first flight, and i t was certainly a",64
NA,thrilline spectacle. I know that official,64
NA,flights have been made since. To,64
NA,"man, the machine is a masterpiece of",64
NA,"workmanship, and its performances have",64
NA,been as good as its appearance.,64
NA,Mr E. EILEY (South Sydney),64
NA,[10.32] -Th e honorable member f o r,64
NA,Perth ( Mr Mann) has complained about,64
NA,the honorable the Minister not giving f u l l,64
NA,information to this House about the seawill,64
NA,plane carrier. I t is possible that the,64
NA,naval authorities have altered,64
NA,of the ship. That is generally done,64
NA,when naval works are being carried out.,64
NA,I f complete drawings are not ready when,64
NA,"the work is started, or i f the plans 'are",64
NA,"altered afterwards, the cost is increased.",64
NA,My information is that the Navy Deprivilege,64
NA,partment is not giving the builders,64
NA,reasonable chance to construct the,64
NA,plane carrier cheaply. The department,64
NA,has not made up its mind about many of,64
NA,the details. I know that the Royal Navy,64
NA,does the same kind of thing. H.M.A.S.,64
NA,Adelaide when completed at Cockatoo,64
NA,was almost a different ship from,64
NA,H . M . A . S . Adelaide as designed.,64
Dr EARLE PAGE ,"Ho w many times,",64
NA,was she obsolete before she was finished?,64
NA,[137],64
NA,Mr E . RILEY - I n other countries,64
NA,naval vessels often become obsolete,64
NA,while they are being built. I t . is a mis-,64
NA,take to spend large sums of money on,64
Mr MANN , T h e n why not cease,64
NA,i n - building the seaplane carrier?,64
NA,Mr E . RILEY - I t is too late to do,64
NA,I would vote at any time to stop the,64
NA,"building of warships, and to spend the",64
NA,I money instead on merchant ships that,64
NA,could render service to the community.,64
NA,I hate to think that we are spending so,64
NA,much money on warships. . The two crui-,64
NA,sers that are being built i n the Old,64
NA,Country will be obsolete in four or five,64
NA,but years. I n that matter the Government,64
NA,would not take the advice of members,64
NA,of of the Opposition and spend the money,64
NA,"on aeroplanes and submarines, which will",64
NA,be comprise the future defence of this coun-,64
NA,I hope that the dockyard will not,64
NA,be blamed for the extra cost of the sea-,64
NA,engaged. plane carrier u n t i l i t is known whether,64
NA,the plans were complete when the work,64
NA,"was started, and whether they have been",64
NA,I altered since; and that the public will,64
NA,attribute the increased cost to the.,64
NA,very workmen. The workmen of this country,64
NA,"can build ships as cheaply, having re-",64
NA,"a laygard to their wages, as the work-",64
NA,men of any other country. Men i n the,64
NA,shipyards here do more work per man,64
NA,than the men i n the shipyards of other,64
NA,countries. I do not know whether that,64
NA,is because they are better fed and better,64
NA,"housed, or because they work i n a better",64
NA,climate; but the fact is that i n almost,64
NA,everyindustry the Australian workman,64
NA,is superior. I hope that the Minister,64
NA,be able to give a' satisfactory ex-,64
NA,planation of the increase i n the cost of,64
NA,the design the seaplane carrier.,64
Mr RODGERS ,Wannon) [10.36] -,64
NA,The honorable member for Perth ( M r.,64
NA,Mann) has stated my view of this matter.,64
NA,Honorable members have not had the,64
NA,of hearing from the honorable,64
NA,a the Minister for Defence ( Sir - Neville,64
NA,seaHowse) an outline of the general de-,64
NA,fence system of the nation. I know that,64
NA,great confidence is felt throughout Aus-,64
NA,"tralia i n the Minister, and i t would cer-",64
NA,tainly be a stimulus to the people were,64
NA,he to make a broad statement on the sub-,64
NA,ject of defence. A high military au-,64
NA,"thority i n this country, Sir John Monash,",64
NA,recently made some pointed remarks,64
NA,about the shortcomings of Australia's de-,64
NA,fence provisions.,64
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,I n his last,65
NA,speech he praised our defence.,65
Mr RODGERS ,An d he spoke of,65
NA,"shortcomings, too. He criticized, not",65
NA,"the honorable the Minister, but the nation",65
NA,as a whole. I thought the Minister,65
NA,would have taken this opportunity to give,65
NA,an outline of the steps that are being,65
NA,taken to make the arms of defence effec-,65
NA,tive. I t will come as a great surprise,65
NA,to the people to know that in this new,65
NA,venture of building a seaplane carrier,65
NA,the departmental estimate has been ex-,65
NA,. ceeded by 63 per cent. That is a very,65
NA,"substantial increase, and I hope that",65
NA,there is more warrant for it than we,65
NA,"have heard to-night. I believe that, so",65
NA,"far as possible, the nation's work should",65
NA,be done in Australia. This nation can,65
NA,"be made great only from within, and I",65
NA,hope that the wide gulf that now exists,65
NA,between costs here and elsewhere will be,65
NA,overcome by an overhaul of our internal,65
NA,economic conditions. We should not. if,65
NA,"we can help it, farm out the nation's",65
NA,work. I have the most sincere confi-,65
NA,"dence in the honorable the Minister, and",65
NA,I hope that he will take an early oppor-,65
NA,tunity to give a reasonably complete,65
NA,sketch of the forward steps that are being,65
NA,taken to defend this nation. I t,65
NA,across the cables the other day . that iu,65
NA,the councils of the world Labour,65
NA,Congress great exception was being,65
NA,taken to the White Australia policy.,65
NA,have already said in this House,65
NA,that i f we are ever challenged on,65
NA,"this matter, we shall not be supported",65
NA,"by many nations from whom, in the",65
NA,"past, we have expected support. Of the",65
NA,"400,000,000 subjects of the British Em-",65
NA,"pire, not more than 65,000,000 are white",65
NA,persons; the rest belong to coloured races.,65
NA,I f we are challenged on such a question,65
NA,there may be something in the nature,65
NA,of a general upheaval. We cannot ex-,65
NA,pect very much assistance from our kins-,65
NA,"men in the United States of America,",65
NA,where they are faced with a problem which,65
NA,we wish to avoid. This is the most im-,65
NA,portant subject with which an Australian,65
NA,"Parliament can deal, and, consequently,",65
NA,demands full consideration and a definite,65
NA,assurance that everything is being done,65
NA,in the interests of the nation.,65
Mr WEST ,East Sydney) [10.41],65
NA,understand that the object of the,65
NA,". sure is to olace £1,250,000 into",65
NA,fund to meet payments on certain,65
NA,defence works. 1 should be more,65
NA,pleased i f the expenditure was to be in-,65
NA,curred in constructing homes for the,65
NA,"people, instead of on machines for blowing",65
NA,out other peoples' brains. I f the Govern-,65
NA,ment wishes the air service to be properly,65
NA,"developed, further .consideration should be",65
NA,given to a suggestion already made that,65
NA,the machines now under the control of the,65
NA,Defence Department be used by the Postal,65
NA,Department for the carriage of mails,65
NA,and passengers. They could be in charge,65
NA,"of A ir Force officers, who would then",65
NA,have an opportunity of being efficiently,65
NA,trained. There are at present two com-,65
NA,"panies carrying mails and passengers, but",65
NA,the passenger rates are so heavy that the,65
NA,service is of no benefit to the com-,65
NA,munity.,65
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,Calare-Min -,65
NA,ister for Defence and Health [10.45] -,65
NA,The honorable member for Perth ( Mr.,65
NA,"Mann), and the honorable member who",65
NA,"followed him, are evidently under the",65
NA,impression that this is the occasion on,65
NA,which some definite announcement should,65
NA,be made concerning the defence policy of,65
NA,the Government. The defence policy of,65
NA,the Government will be fully outlined,65
NA,rang when the Estimates are under considera-,65
NA,"tion, I hope next month.",65
Mr MANN ,Thi s money will then,65
NA,I have been spent.,65
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,Commit -,65
NA,ments have already been entered into.,65
NA,"The sum of £1,000,000 is to be spent on",65
NA,"naval construction, and the expenditure",65
NA,has already been agreed to by the,65
NA,"House. The £250,000 is something addi-",65
NA,tional.,65
Mr FOSTER ,Whe n will the seaplane,65
NA,carrier be completed?,65
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,I n 192S.,65
NA,I n reply to the question of the honor-,65
NA,"able member for Dalley ( Mr Mahony),",65
NA,I may explain that according to the in-,65
NA,formation received from London there,65
NA,will be no delay in the completion of,65
NA,"the cruisTS. A delay of, approximately,",65
NA,three months is expected in the delivery,65
NA,of the submarines. The work of the. sea-,65
NA,plane carrier is being carried out within,65
NA,contract time. The seaplane carrier is to,65
NA,"- I cost £1,300,000. The tentative estimate",65
NA,"meawas £850,000, but certain modifications",65
NA,a trust have increased the amount.,65
Mr MANN ,I s tbat due to alteration,66
NA,in tbe plans?,66
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"Partly , and",66
NA,to the extra cost of material. As thc,66
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton),66
NA,". pointed out, there can be no question as",66
NA,to the value to Australia of an adequate,66
NA,"air force, and I only wish that the",66
NA,amount we propose spending were,66
NA,"£1,000,000 instead of £250,000. I f the",66
NA,larger amount were available during the,66
NA,"next two or three years, the air for.ee",66
NA,could effectively co-operate with the. sister,66
NA,services.,66

NA,Clause 1 agreed to.,66
NA,"Clause 2 (Appropriation of £1,000,000",66
NA,for naval construction)-,66
Mr MANN ,Perth) [10.49] - I merely,66
NA,wish to say a few words concerning the,66
NA,Minister's explanation of the manner in,66
NA,which the money is to be spent.,66
NA,My protest was not against the policy of,66
NA,the Government; for I said most dis-,66
NA,tinctly that I favoured a progressive de-,66
NA,fence policy. The Minister apparently,66
NA,"misunderstood my remarks, for I did not",66
NA,suggest that this occasion was appropriate,66
NA,for the Government to announce its de-,66
NA,"fence policy. The policy, as a matter of",66
NA,"fact, has been announced, and has been",66
NA,"approved by Parliament, although some",66
NA,new members have been elected since i t,66
NA,"was agreed to. But surely, even though",66
NA,the general lines of the policy have been,66
NA,"agreed upon, the Minister has not been",66
NA,relieved of the duty of explaining the,66
NA,items which make up the total of an,66
NA,appropriation bill of this character. I t,66
NA,is quite likely that modifications and,66
NA,"alterations may be made in the policy, in",66
NA,regard to which honorable members,66
NA,should be enlightened. The Minister,66
NA,has admitted that greater expenditure is,66
NA,being incurred now in regard to air de-,66
NA,fence. I think we are entitled to a pro-,66
NA,"gress report on matters of that kind, and",66
NA,also to some information on the general,66
NA,trend of defence affairs. I asked the,66
NA,"Miniater, I think in a co-UTteons way; to",66
NA,give us an explanation of how this money,66
NA,"was being expended, but we were given",66
NA,one only after considerable pressure had,66
NA,heen applied. I submit that that is not,66
NA,treating honorable members courteously.,66
NA,I t is customary to include a schedule in,66
NA,bills of this character setting out .details,66
NA,of the expenditure. I am sure that we,66
NA,all have the greatest confidence in the,66
NA,"Minister, but, nevertheless, he should",66
NA,accede to reasonable requests for ex-,66
NA,planations in matters of this character.,66
Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,Calare-Min -,66
NA,ister for Defence and Health) [10.54] -,66
NA,I thought I had made i t perfectly clear,66
NA,that this money was necessary tb meet,66
NA,definite commitments in regard to the,66
NA,"two 10,000-ton cruisers and two sub-",66
NA,marines and one seaplane carrier that the,66
NA,Government is having built. I repeat,66
NA,that this LS not the appropriate time to,66
NA,explain in detail the progress that is,66
NA,being made in carrying out our,66
NA,"£7,000,000 defence constructional policy.",66
NA,Clause agreed to.,66

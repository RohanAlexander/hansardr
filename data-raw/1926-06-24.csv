2,Mr LISTER ,"Some time ago I asked the Minister for Defence a question concerning the training of boys for the Australian Navy, and received the reply that the matter was then under consideration by the Government. I should like to know whether the Minister has seen the statement on the subject appearing in yesterday's Argus and other Melbourne newspapers? Has the honourable gentleman arrived at any decision on the inatter, and, if so, what?",14
3,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"I have read the article in the Argus, and the matter is still under the consideration of the Government. PUINTING COMMITTEE'S . REPORT. Report (No. 2) brought up by Mr E. EILEY, read by the Clerk, and adopted. DUTY ON MAIZE.",14
4,Dr NOTT ,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether it is his intention to interfere in any way with the existing tariff as it applies to the maize industry ? NA had the consideration of the Government, and it is not thought desirable at the present time to interfere with the duties that have been accepted by both Houses of the Parliament. MAIN ROADS GRANT.",14
5,Mr FENTON ,"Is the. Government making available to the various States sums of money from the Federal main roads grant? If not, when will the money be available? Will the Prime Minister treat the mr *ter as urgent, to enable the JUNE, 1926.] Sugar Rebate. 6479 State Governments to find employment for many who are out of work at the present time?",14
6,Mr BRUCE ,"Some two months ago, the Government communicated with the State Governments, intimating that, on the expiration of the present financial year, it would be prepared to make available to them monthly payments equivalent to one-twelfth of the amount provided in the present year, so that there might be no stoppage of operations. A number of the State Governments are taking advantage of this offer. SUGAR REBATE. SMALLFEUIT - CANNI NG COMPANIES.",14
7,Mr MACKAY ,"During the debate last night I made some remarks on the difficulty which some fruit canners who are in a small way of business have in obtaining a rebate on sugar supplied to them. I should like to know from the Minister for Trade and Customs what is the responsibility of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Sugar Board in this connection. Has the Government any power to interfere in the matter? NA sibility of the Sugar Board is to see that the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Queensland is carried out. Beyond this, the Commonwealth does not interfere. I noted the honourable member's remarks in connection with the supply of small quantities of sugar to certain manufacturers. I shall pursue the matter, and in due course will give the honourable member the information for which he has asked. REPATRIATION OF SOLDIERS. LOANS TO STATES.",14

How is the sum of £150,000 arrived at as an estimate of the cost of this territor y to the Western Australian Government? 2. Does this represent the difference between expenditure in and revenue from that area, or is it only the amount providedon the annual estimates for services therein ? 3. If revenue from that area is taken into account, how is it arrived at?",15
11,Dr EARLE PAGE ,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. On behalf of the Western Australian Gofollow:vernment, a statement was tendered to the Royal Commission on the Finances of Western Australia as affected by-Federation, which indicated that the annual loss on the North-west was £318,036. It was subsequently stated in evidence by the Assistant Under-Treasurer of Western Australia that the loss was not so great as was originally thought; also that ordinary expenditure would only be slightly in excess of revenue other than land rents. Land rents were stated to be £91,697. All available statements and figures were examined and the annual loss was estimated at £150,000. This estimate includes interest and sinking 11,968,176 fund on loan expenditure of £2,681,935 at 30th 2,717,697 June, 1924, and the difference between esti. . 2,857,780 . mated expenditures and revenues on all services in connection with the North-west. - 2,168,303 2.

Is it a fact that tenders for the supply of Pacific Island steamship services closed on 15th January, 1925, and that Burns, Philp, and Company were the only tenderers? 2. Is it a fact that full information in regard to this tender was published in the press, although the Government did not see fit to accept it? 3. Is it a fact that further tenders were invited, closing on 30th November, 1925, and that no finality has yet been reached in the matter ? 4. Is it a fact that Burns, Philp, and Company have had their contract extended from month to month, whilst the Government is endeavouring to encourage ships manned .by black labour and foreign labour to enter this trade ? 5. Will the Government definitely state what is proposed in this matter?",15
15,Mr MARR ,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. Yes. 2. Certain information in regard to the tender appeared in the Sydney press, but the Government is unaware of the' circumstances under which it was published. 3. Yea. 4. The contract expired on 31st July, 1925, but was extended for six months in the first place, and later for a further period of six montlis from 1st February, 1926, with the object of enabling the fullest investigation to be made by the Government into all aspects of the service in question before finalizing its plans for the future. 5. The Government expects to be in a position to make an announcement in regard to this matter at an early date. LOSS OF S.S. DORRIGO.",15
16,Mr FORDE ,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Has his attention been drawn to an article appearing in the Eockhampton Morning Bulletin of the 5th instant, entitled "" The Dorrigo Disaster and its Lessons "" ? 2. In view of the points raised in the article mentioned, will he obtain, from competent naval architects, data with respect to the lost vessel showing(a) the height of the centre of gravity above the ship's bottom; and (6) the position of the metacentre relatively to the centre of gravityat the time of the Dorrigo leaving Brisbane on the voyage on which she was lost? 3. On the data supplied as in 2, will he obtain from a competent naval architect an opinion regarding the seaworthiness of the Dorrigo at the time of her departure as above? 4. Will he ascertain whether proper scientific data regarding the stability of the Dorrigo was given by her former owners to her new owners when she changed hands in June, 1925? 5. If the answer to 4 is in the negative, will he cause such steps to be taken as will ensure the supply of such information or data to new owners being part of the formal business of transferring ships from one owner to another? NA honourable member's questions are as follow:1. I have seen the article referred to. 2 and 3. A properly constituted Court of Marine Inquiry, assisted by two experienced shipmasters as nautical assessors, exhaustively investigated the circumstances attending the loss of the Dorrigo. One of the principal matters investigated by the court was the disposition of. the cargo in the vessel's holds, but as the officers who had charge of the stowage in Brisbane were both lost with the ship, the information obtained by the court on the distribution of weights in the vessel was presumably not sufficiently definite to enable any useful question as to the vessel's stability being put to a naval architect. The court, it may be mentioned, had full power to require the attendance of any naval architect as a. witness. 4. The evidence given at the inquiry showed that the new owners did not receive from the vendors any precise particulars regarding the stability of the vessel. 5. The whole procedure in connection with the sale and transfer of ships is governed entirely throughout the Empire by the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain. Under this act, there is no power to require the supply by vendors of data regarding the stability of a vessel. CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL. Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. DOMESDAY BOOK. Notice of motion in the name of Dr MALOITEY postponed u n t i l 8th July. ELECTI VE MINTSTEIES. - Notice of motion in the name of Mr . STEWART postponed u n t i l Sth July. NEW STATES. Debate resumed from 27th May (vide",16
17,Mr THOMPSON ,"NA SONThat, in the opinion of this House, a referendum throughout Australia should be taken during the life of the present Parliament on the question of amending the Federal Constitution so as to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to establish new States on such terms and conditions as it may think fit within the boundaries of existing States, with or without the consent of State Parliaments.",16
18,Mr FORDE ,"Capricornia) [2.43] When the debate on this motion was adjourned, the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr R. Green) was speaking, and obtained leave to continue his remarks at a later date. It is suggested to me now by the Treasurer that I should move the further adjournment of the debate in order to permit the honourable member who is absent today to resume his remarks three weeks hence - I would readily agree to that suggestion but for the fact that, on the last occasion, the honourable member spoke for about forty-five minutes, and u n t i l the time available for the discussion of private members' business had expired. It was known then to honourable members opposite that I was anxious to say a few words, really by way of interrogation to the Treasurer. I was anxious to ascertain from him why nothing had been done to put into effect the New States plank of the Country party's platform. But despite m y occasional interruptions to that effect, the honourable member for Richmond continued his speech, and despite my protest the debate was postponed for a month. I was most anxious - to have a division on the motion. This is a matter which should be very near to the heart of the Treasurer, and he should support the motion with all the eloquence at his command. When the right honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr . Hughes) was Prime Minister, the honourable member for Cowper ( Dr Earle Page) occupied a position on the cross benches and frequently delivered eloquent speeches, which were read with great pleasure by the New States people outside, urging the Government to take a referendum on the question of amending the Constitution on the lines now suggested by the honourable member for New England ( Mr Thompson). My chief pose in speaking today is to prompt' the Treasurer to declare the policy of the Government on this matter. During the last. Parliament, motions identical with that moved by the honourable member for New England were placed on the notice paper .by men who had secured their election by tolling the people that they stood for the creation of new States, and that everything would be well when those new States were brought into existence. Those who have been returned to Parliament by making certain promise."", to the electors should "" deliver the goods,"" instead of merely placing motions on the business-paper and allowing them to be talked out. I am anxious that a division should be taken on the motion of the honourable member for New England, and for that reason I cannot accept the suggestion that the debate should be postponed for another three weeks. D u r in g the last federal election campaign the Treasurer made use of the New States issue in order to assist the Country party's candidates. He visited Rockhampton, where I do not think he played the game fairly, because he received a deputation' from the New States League, and used the occasion to criticize me instead of confessing candidly that he had done nothing for their ment.",16
19,Dr EARLE PAGE ,The statement. I had done nothing is absolutely inaccufact. rate. JHr. Forde.,17
20,Mr FORDE ,"The Treasurer has done a great deal of talking about the making of new States, but what else? Although he has occupied the second position, in the present Cabinet for four years, during w hich period he was Acting Prime r Minister for twelve months, he has done nothing to furthe r the New States movement in a practical way. He knows very well that new States cannot be created by the State Parliaments, and that nothing definite can be done to bring about their establishment, except by a. general remodelling of the Federal Constitution, which necessitates action on the part of the Federal Parliament. He has attended New States conventions and made eloquent speeches, which placed . some of the people in the north, who suffer great disabilities under the present arrangement of the State boundaries, on purthe tiptoe of expectation regarding the creation of new States, and they applauded him as the leader of the movement. In this way, he succeeded in winning the New England seat for the honourable member who now holds it . . I do not think that honourable member will deny it . Mr Massy Greene originally lost the Richmond seat largely because it was said that he was not a New .States enthusiast. At that time the whole of northern New South Wales was organized to fight for the New States movement, and over 300 delegates attended a conference at Armidale. The Treasurer spoke to them of what he would' do, and they applauded him. They expected great things from his advocacy of the movement, but, so far , he has done nothing practical. He has merely talked, and talk is cheap. D u r in g the Eden Monaro by-election campaign the honourable gentleman made an eloquent speech on the New States movement, a report of which I read in the press, and he urged the electors to vote for the Nationalist candidate, because, as he put it , .the Government believed in the establishment of new States. We have not yet heard one word of the Government's policy in that regard. The Treasurer took me to task because I was move- not a member of the New States Parliamentary Committee, but the honourable gentleman himself is not a member of it , that and makes all sorts of excuses for that",17
21,Mr THOMPSON ,I rise to a point of order. The honourable member f cornia made a gross misstatement when he said that the Treasurer is not a memsurer done? ber of the New States League.,18

23,Mr FORDE ,I said that the Treaber surer is not a member of the New States Parliamentary Committee.,18
24,Mr THOMPSON ,He is.,18
25,Mr FORDE ,"I was told by the honourable member, and by others, that the Treasurer is not a member of that committee, and the honourable excused his Leader on the ground that member of the Cabinet could not be a member of such a committee.",18
26,Mr THOMPSON ,That.is not correct.,18
27,Mr FORDE ,"If the Treasurer is a member of the New States Parliamentary Committee, he must have joined it after until I had called attention to the fact that be was not a member of it .",18
28,Mr THOMPSON ,That is a deliberate lie.,18
29,Mr BRENNAN ,I rise to order. The honourable member for New England accused the honourable member for Capricornia of having told a deliberate lie.,18
30,Mr SPEAKER ,"I d id not hear honourable member for New England and not the Labour party. make that statement, but if he did, him to withdraw it . Mr THOMPSON!-Ou t of deference to to you, Mr Speaker, I withdraw it ; but it is of true, nevertheless.",18
31,Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honormajorit able member must withdraw the statelast ment unconditionally.,18
32,Mr THOMPSON ,I withdraw it .,18
33,Mr FORDE ,"I would not tell a about any honourable member. I am prised and disappointed that the honoring. able member will not admit what he knows he told me. Several honand orable members of this House excused the Treasurer for not joining the States Parliamentary Committee, on ground that, as a Minister, he could not join a committee that was urging upon surer saidthe Government a certain policy. Apparently by calling attention to the Treathe surer's default, I have done something lia to bring him up to the collar.",18
34,Dr EARLE PAGE ,The honourable o r Caprimember has not done that.,18
35,Mr FORDE ,What has the TreaMONICA,18
36,Dr EARLE PAGE ,He has paid his,18
37,Mr FORDE ,"He has not gone During the general election campaign, the honourable memreceived a deputation from the New States League. A ' Country party candidate was opj)osing me, and the Treasurer tried to influence the electors to vote against me. He was reported in the Evening News, of the 6th October, 1925, to have saidmember given I pay a tribute to the consideration always to New States matters by Senator a Thompson while in Melbourne. They had weekly meetings there, and kept very much alive with matters concerning the movement. I regret, however, that we were never able to get a member of the Labour party along to those meetings, not even the member for Capricornia, who seems to always leave the little he intended doing for the movement he got back to his electorate. The honourable member went on to say that Labour members had fallen down on the job. Is it not the Treasurer who has fallen down on the job ? In the last Parliament, of 75 members in has this House, Labour had only 29.",18
38,Mr BELL ,And still fewer now.,18
39,Mr FORDE ,"That emphasizes the the fact that the Government is to blame The I ask duty of the Government is to formulate its policy, and submit it the House for the consideration honourable members. The composite Government, with an overwhelming y of supporters in this and the Parliament, could at any time during the last four years have submitted proposals for the amendment of the Conlie stitution to facilitate the formation of surnew States. B ut it has done nothI take exception to the Treasurer trying to cloak his indifference apathy in regard to the . subject by blaming the Labour ' party. New Speaking, as Acting Prime Minister at the a New States conference, in Rockhampton, on the 26th October, 1923, the Trea- That some radical change is necessary in present system of government in Austrais the most wide and universally held belief in all quarters of Australia at the present time. It is readily felt that federation has failed to accomplish much of the aim for which it was consummated. It has not created that intense national feeling. All parochial considerations disregard the existence of imaginary State boundaries, and prevent the continuation of that system of pitting one capital city against another which has proved so detrimental to the balanced and proportionate development of Australia as a whole. He repeated these platitudes in New England, Eden-Monaro, and elsewhere. the Treasurer had any political he would be quiet on the hustings regarding the New States movement be hadabsolutely done something. has never, to my knowledge, speech of a practical nature House on the subject since he has been in the position to do something He now reserves his talk for up country. When, as Leader of the party, he sat on the ministerial bench, he took the right honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) to task for not having done anything help the creation of new States; since he has been in office, he seems to have forgotten this matter. He tries to place the responsibility on the Labour party and myself, and would have the people of Central Queensland that all would have been well if I had joined the New States Parliamentary Committee. The Labour party took the only logical action it could take, by declining to enter into a secret with the National-Country party tion, which already had the in the House to do what it thought It was the Government's duty to bring down proposals and give members an opportunity of considering them. Senator Thompson, who comes from Central Queensland, has taken an interest in the New States movement in his own district, and has league meetings and has been to Armidale and other places. The Treasurer's remark that whatever I have had to say has been said in my own electorate is incorrect, for I have spoken on this subject in Parliament every time have had an opportunity. One does hot help such a movement by attending meetings of members of the New States Parliamentary Committee and the time of day with the Treasurer his room at Parliament House. way honourable members are bottled up and are not free to criticize. Mr Forde. orable members who support the movement should express their views in the House when an opportunity like the present offers-a n opportunity which, by the way, the Treasurer sought to postpone for three weeks. I am asking the Government to give an account of its actions in this matter, and I am hoping . If to induce the Treasurer to declare what honesty, it intends to do.. The policy of the Government of waiting for some other day until on which to announce its intentions docs He not commend itself to those persons in made a northern New South Wales who have in this spent hundreds of pounds, and put themselves to great inconvenience, to effective. organize New States conventions. On consulting the Hansard reports, I find Country that Senator Thompson, to whom the cross Treasurer has given credit for his work in this movement, said nothing in the Senate on this subject during 1923 to and 1924. On the 28th August, 1925, but however, he made the following brief comment, which is reported on page 1S33. of Hansard of that date: As the question of a new States referendum believe is to be brought under the notice of the Prime Minister ( Mr Bruce), I trust the matter will be given sympathetic consideration, and that the machinery necessary for creating new States will be simplified. An appeal would have to be made to the people by way of referendum, and that is all that is being asked conclave for at present. secnumbers That is the only reference made by right. Senator Thompson to the subject during that year. What was wanted was straight honourable talk, and not platitudes. The Country party, went before the electors in 1922, in opposition to the right honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) and the National party, on a platform which conattended tained the following planks :FEDERAL CONVENTION AND FORMATION OF NEW STATES TO SECURE PRACTICAL DECENTRALIZATION. (a) To advocate the early holding of a Federal Convention to consider the revising of the Constitution, such convention to be elected on I the Federal rolls, and each State to be divided into five electorates returning three delegates the for each electorate by the system of proportional representation. To aim at securing new and definite apportionments of the powers and passing duties of the Federal and State authorities. in (B) In order to bring about economical and In that efficient State government and administration, and to avoid costly duplication of State and Federal activities, it is necessary to subdivide Hon- the present unwieldy States into manageable areas with community of interests under their own Constitution, thereby bringing about a simpler form of State government, leaving all national functions to the Federal Parliament. On that platform! the honourable the Treasurer became very eloquent when addressing the electors of . Cowper, and he was largely instrumental in securing the election of the honourable member for New England ( Mr Thompson), and the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr . R. Green), the latter in opposition to the National candidate, Mr Massy Greene. ""When the composite Ministry formed after the election, the Treasurer - was clothed with power to do something, but the next thing we heard of the New States movement was the following questions asked of the right honourable the Prime Minister by the honourable member for New England, on the 4th July, 1923:1. Whether certain letters have been received from the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland inviting the Commonwealth Government to take action to bring about' the amendment of the Constitution, in order to facilitate the creation of new States in New South Wales and Queensland? 2. If so, what action, if any, has the Commonwealth Government taken to comply with the suggestions or proposals made by the States referred to? The Prime Minister's reply was:The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. In both cases the respective Governments - were informed of the action it was necessary for them to take to comply with the requirements of the Constitution. The Treasurer was placing the responsibility on the States, and the States were throwing it back on the Commonof wealth. That game of battledore and shuttlecock continued for a long time. The Treasurer went to northern New South Wales and advised the advocates of New States to keep their powder dry and all would be well soon. The people are tired of that advice, and now want action, which I am trying to induce Government to take. The letter received from the Queensland Government the result of the following motion moved Nationalists. by me, and carried almost unanimously, in the Queensland Parliament 6th July, 1922:That in the opinion of this Parliament time has arrived for the remodelling of Commonwealth Constitution providing for subdivision of Australia into a greater number of self-governing States, making for more economical and effective government, and also providing an easy method for the people living in any district, such as central Queensland or northern New South Wales, to obtain self-government; and that the Prime Minister of Australia be urged to take the necessary steps to bring about these reforms. That resolution was subsequently presented to the right honourable the Prime Minister. The chief opponent of it was Mr A . E . Moore, the leader of the Country party, and now the Leader of was the. Opposition, in the Queensland Parliament, who said I am opposed to the proposal, because it is only going to lead to expense. . . . I am opposing both motion and amendment, because I do not think there has been any mandate from the people outside, or any agitation, to speak of, amongst them. . . . There may be a little private agitation in one or two small centres in central and nortliern Queensland, but there has been no agitation which has shaken Queensland as a whole. We know that conditions today are totally different from what they were many years ago, when Separation was a live question. We have the railway to Rockhampton, and it is almost completed, right up to the north. . . . There is no doubt that the proposal would not lead to economy. The Lands Department has a branch in Rockhampton, the Railway Department is practically decentralized, and Rockhampton has its own Chief of Staff, who is only responsible to the Commissioner. He has the running of the railways generally in that area; and the same remark applies to the north. I do not tliink the reason exists today that existed twenty years ago, when this was a live question. . . . I claim the right to say that I object to Separation . . . . it will not be for the benefit of the State, and I intend to oppose both the amendment and the motion. I mention these facts because members the Country party state that theirs is the only party that advocates the remodelling of the Constitution in order to provide facilities for the creation of new States. A certain amount of blame has been attached to the Labour party in my electorate for its alleged inactivity, but the Government has. a m a j o r i ty in this the Parliament, and its duty is to act. The greatest opposition to the New States was movement has come from prominent Mr W. H . Barnes, a leading Nationalist in Queensland, said, on the on the 30th July, 1922In my judgment, it would be a huge mistake the to cut up Queensland into smaller States. I the think it would be an unwise thing for this the House to agree to a motion of this kind. Notwithstanding the opposition, my motion was passed with the port of the Labour members, because it was in accordance with the platform of the Labour party.",18
40,Mr THOMPSON ,Whic h nevertheless did nothing.,21
41,Mr FORDE ,"I give the honourable member for New England ( Mr Thompson) credit for having taken a live in terest in this question. I believe he has tried to push the Government into doing something. The blame for inaction should be placed upon the shoulders, of the Government, not the Labour party. On the 24th July, 1924, the honourable member moved the following motion in this House: Tliat, in the opinion, of this House, the Government should, at the earliest opportunity, introduce a bill providing for a referendum of the electors of Australia at the next general elections upon a proposal to amend chapter VI . (New States) of the Commonwealth Constitution, so as to empower the Federal Parliament to create new States within the existing States, with or without the consent of the State Parliaments; such power only to be used on the petition of a fixed number of electors in any area, and only after the State Parliament has failed to take action. Nothing came of it , for although the Government had 46 members in the House against 29 Labour members, it side-tracked the motion, as it does all private members' business. The motion was so much window-dressing designed to keep alive the enthusiasm of the New Staters, to make them believe that something would be done. It was also intended to permit the Treasurer still to pose as the leader of a great movement, which he had thrown over after climbing into power on it .",21
42,Mr HUGHES ,It was what the AmeriT cans call eye-wash.,21
43,Mr FORDE ,"In July, 1923, the honourable member for New England in troduced to the Prime Minister ( Mr . Bruce) a deputation which pressed for some definite action in regard to the setting up of new States. In reply to the request the Prime Minister said I give you an assurance that the Government realizes that it has to investigate the matter very closely indeed with a view to coming to some determination as to whether action is to be taken. The time when we will have to come to the point of giving expression of our opinions will be next year. .That would have been in 1924. The supPrime Minister went onIt will almost certainly be next year when the question of constitutional alterations will be considered' by the Federal Parliament if . - the present Government is still in office. When that time comes, your suggestions will receive the very fullest consideration. That also was what the right honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) has aptly termed eye-wash, for nothing has been done to give effect fo it . Those interested in the Ney States movement kept up their propaganda in the expectation that the Government would honour its undertaking, and various mem- bers of the organization attended meetings night after night in support, of the movement. I give the honourable member for New England ( Mr Thompson) credit for his activities in that direction; but I object to him excusing the Treasurer for his inactivity. He should condemn both the Treasurer and the Government in strong terms, . and tell us what has happened behind the scenes to prevent the fulfilment of their platform promises. In speaking in this chamber on the 24th July, 1924, the honourable member, in referring to the statement of the Prime Minister which I have just quoted, saidThe Government has not taken any steps to translate that fairly definite promise into action. The honourable member then proceeded to excuse the Government on the ground that it had been very busy, and he asked the House to give it a lead. I contend that the Treasurer, who came here as the champion of the New Staters, should give the House a lead. It should not be necessary for us to prod him into action. challenge him to give an account of his stewardship, and to state in plain terms his policy in this matter. The Labour party has a definite New States policy, which, when it is returned to power, it will put into effect. It s platform in regard to constitutional amendments reads:1. Complete Australian self-government as a British community. No Imperial federation. Administration on advice of Australian Ministers only, subject to the control of the Commonwealth Parliament. All legislation except such as appears inconsistent with Imperial treaty obligations to be assented to on the advice of Australian Ministers only. No further Imperial, honours to be granted in any circumstances to Australian citizens. The Commonwealth Constitution to be amended to provide(a) Unlimited legislative powers for the Commonwealth Parliament, and such delegated powers to the States or provinces as the Commonwealth Parliament may determine from time to time. (b) The Commonwealth Parliament to be vested with authority to create new States or provinces. It has been said that the Labour party stands for unification, that is, one government for Australia. I disagree with that interpretation of our platform. Whatthis party stands for is the clothing of this Parliament with unlimited powers, and the devolution of adequate governing powers to subordinate legislatures, in such provincial areas as Northern New South Wales, Central Queensland,-Northern Queensland, and others where local developmental work could be advantageously undertaken.",21
44,Mr THOMPSON ,Some members of Labour party declare that its platform provides for unification.,22
45,Mr FORDE ,"No person is correct in saying such a thing. That is not the way I read it . It provides that this Parliament shall have sovereign power, and that provincial parliaments with adequate, authority shall be set up in those parts of the Commonwealth where the population and resources are sufficient for local government to be effective. Those provincial authorities could be granted powers necessary from time time by the National Parliament. No doubt, certain objections this proposal will be taken by some sup porters of the New States movement. The motion submitted by the honourable member for New England proposes that this Parliament shall have power to divide the Commonwealth into new States on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit. Our platform makes similar provision. What the Labour party proposes is that the Commonwealth Parliament shall be the sovereign authority, and that the State Parliaments shall be subordinate bodies. If given effect, this proposal would involve the abolition of the upper houses and the positions of State governors, and would tend to economy and efficiency. There would be only the Governor General of Australia as the representative of His Majesty the K in g . Reconstruction in the way propsed would involve less centralization than unification.",22
46,Mr GARDINER ,Would the provincial parliaments have sovereign powers?,22
47,Mr FORDE ,"No ; sovereign powers would be vested only in the Federal Parliament. There would be a greater number of provincial governments than we now have of State governments: but the number of legislators would be reduced. The cost of government in Australia today is excessive. If the figures are looked up it will be found ' that it amounts approximately to £1,100,000 a year, or 3s. 8d. per head of the population. We have 645 members of Parliament. The cost of running the electoral departments is, approximately, for the Commonwealth £100,000, and for the States £83,000, or a total of £183,000 per annum. There is today. a duplication of electoral rolls, and in any .year in which elections are held there is considerthe able additional expenditure on electoral affairs.",22
48,Mr THOMPSON ,The Labour party has never put that scheme before the country.,22
49,Mr FORDE ,"Yes , it has; and I have referred to it on every occasion upon which I have had an opportunity to discuss the formation of new States.",22
50,Mr HUGHES ,Has the proposal outlined by the honourable member ever been put before the Commonwealth?,22
51,Mr FORDE ,Yes . It is included in the amended platform of the Labour to party. It was included at the instigation of Mr Theodore at the conference which to was held in Brisbane in 1921. Pre1 viously the Labour party went somewhat into detail and set out the number of States into which the Commonwealth should be divided.,22
52,Mr HUGHES ,The honourable member is referring to the Federal platform of the Labour party.,22
53,Mr FORDE ,"Yes . Mr Theodore said, "" Let us deal with principles. When we get into power we can give effect to our platform, and can then work out the details.""",22
54,Mr THOMPSON ,Has the Labour party abandoned the idea of subdividing Australia into 31 provinces?,22
55,Mr FORDE ,"Yes . That was contained in a plank arbitrarily laid down by conference some years ago on the motion of a certain member of the Labour party, who was very enthusiastic about the formation of new States. He proposed that Australia should be divided into 31 States. That proposal has been set aside and the new platform of the Labour party takes its place. proposed that the provinces may deal with purely local matters, such as land settlement, police, local authorities, tion, health, and the administration of justice. The control of railways is a matter which should be left for future consideration. It is proposed that unlimited power should be vested in the Commonwealth Parliament, and that there should be a greater number of provincial or State Parliaments of a much simpler form and involving less expenditure. Their membership would be reduced, and there would be greater economy and efficiency of government, because the governing authority, under the system proposed, would be nearer to the people than it is under existing conditions. In the case of a big sheep run covering an area of 100 square miles that portion with in reasonable distance of the head station is generally better looked after than the outlying portions. It should tend to greater efficiency and economy of government to establish provincial parliaments with the necessary powers for all local developmental purposes. The members of such parliaments would be more conversant with local conditions, and better informed, of the requirements of the people. hope that the Treasurer will announce the policy of the Government, and tell us what it intends to do in this matter. For four years I have anxiously waited to hear him utter a word as to what he has been doing in the councils of the Cabinet. I should like to know what he has done of a practical nature, apart from flamboyant speeches and the uttering of numerous platitudes on the hustings. I have waited in vain for information, on the subject from the honourable gentleman, and I challenge him now to rise to his feet and tell the House his policy and the policy of the Government.",22
56,Mr ABBOTT ,"Gwydir) [ 3 . 2 8 ] - I do not intend to take up very much of the time of the House in discussing this motion. In his previous speeches the honourable member for New England ( Mr Thompson), has put the case for the New States movement very clearly, and with a great deal of consistency. I should like to say that when a matter like this is being discussed it is a great p it y ' that any honourable members should make it an opportunity for a very bitter It is personal attack, and for the pouring out of an accumulation of bile.",23
57,Mr FORDE ,I made no personal educa- attack. I wanted some announcement from the Treasurer.,23
58,Mr ABBOTT ,"I noticed that the honourable member also said that Senator Thompson is very weak indeed on this question of the formation of new States. The honourable member measured Senator Thompson's enthusiasm for the cause by the space he has used in Hansard. If the space used in Hansard is to be taken as a measure of enthusiasm and support for a cause, the honourable member for Capricornia must always put forward exceedingly good cases.",23
59,Mr FORDE ,"The Treasurer told the people of my district that. I never said anything on the subject here, but reserved what I had .to say for Rockhampton.",23
60,Mr ABBOTT ,"All that the Treasurer ever said about the honourable member for Capricornia was that he never did anything for new States beyond the speaking of w i l d and whirling words. There is no question of the Treasurer's belief in the New States movement, or of the sincerity I of the honourable gentleman towards it . The people of northern New South Wales, and all who know the honourable gentleman, are aware that in him we have a most stalwart supporter of the movement. I do not propose to dwell on that aspect of the matter any further. It seemed to me that the time is ripe for the subdivision of Australia into a greater number of States. Every one must now agree that an enormous continent like this cannot continue to be governed as it has been governed in the past, by authorities in charge of great areas. It has been shown that a near perspective is necessary for good government. When we consider that what will practically be a new state is to be formed in the Northern Terri tory, and that it has been suggested that a new province should be formed in the north-west of Western Australia, it is clear that the trend of public opinion is in the direction of the New States movement. I have always regarded Victoria as illustrating the efficiency with which the government of rural affairs can be conducted in a comparatively small area. Honourable members may recollect that when the other day I deplored the fact that a great many people are leaving the land I pointed out that the only State that showed an increase in the number of small farmers is Victoria. This fact supports the argument that smaller States than we now have are necessary to secure better and more successful government. I am right in saying that this is a matter which should have the"" close attention of the Federal Parliament. It is to secure that attention that the honourable member for New England has submitted his motion. I suggest to the honourable member that he should amend his motion to r e a d That the question of the method of establishing new States should be considered in conjunction with other constitutional questions at the proposed constitutional session of this Parliament. Such a session, we understand, is to take place at Canberra next year.",23
61,Mr FORDE ,Is this the bridge the Government has built for the honourable member ?,24
62,Mr ABBOTT ,"The constitution of new States is a very important matter. It is one which should be approached in an open manner, and should not be used for the purpose of personal attacks. If the honourable member for New England will accept my suggestion the whole matter of the formation of new States can be very full y dealt with at the forth coming constitutional session of the Federal Parliament at Canberra. move That all the words after the word "" That be loft out with a view to inserting in lieu thereof- "" the question of the method of establishing new States should be considered in conjunction with other constitutional questions at the proposed constitutional session of this Parliament.""",24
63,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON ,"Lang) [3.32]. The honourable member for England ( Mr Thompson) tried, by in terjection, to correct what he considered a misstatement of fact by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) reflecting upon the sincerity of the Trea[135] surer with regard to the New States movement. I learn from the honourable member for New England that the Treasurer was present at the first meeting of the Parliamentary New States Committee, that 'he joined the committee then, and has attended and addressed several meetings since. The honourable member for New England having spoken has not an opportunity to correct the honourable member for Capricornia, who probably quite unintentionally misrepresented the position.",24
64,Mr FORDE ,I was referring to the fact that several members of the New States Committee told me that the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) excused his absence on the ground that he was a member of the Cabinet.,24
65,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON ,"The true position is as stated by the honourable member for New England. W it h regard to the motion under discussion I am afraid that any movement of the kind suggested would not meet with the approbation of the public generally. Certain members of the Federal Parliament would appear, if I may say so, to have developed a referendum mania during recent months. To submit this question with others to the people would only confuse the issues. I do not think that the majority of the electors would approve of the expense in volved in another reference to them on a matter of this kind, which certainly has not received from the general public that attention which the importance attached to it by those responsible for this motion seems to warrant. I think that the trend of opinion with the general publio is that Australia is already too much governed, that it has too many parliaments, and that instead of an extension I of governmental powers through the medium of the establishment of new States involving the creation of new parliaments and all the paraphernalia of new Public Services leading to increased taxation of the people who have to bear the burden, there should be a simplification of our system of government. My own opinion is in favour of an extension of New local governing powers under an arrangement by which the whole of Australia could be divided into provinces, but not with legislative powers under constitutions similar to those under which the States are now working. W it h our limited population, and with the unavoidable i crease in the cost of government entailed by the creation of new States, I think the present proposal would not be favourably received by the people, but if a scheme could be devised to reduce the numerical strength of the existing State Parliaments, - and the cost of existing State Governments, it would meet with more general approbation than would a proposal which is likely to increase the burden on the people. I do not feel inclined to support either the motion or the amendment, and I think the Government would be extremely ill-advised to bring down a measure of the kind suggested at the present time.",24
66,Dr EARLE PAGE ,"Cowper-Trea surer) [3.39] - I regret that the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) should have imported into this debate a great deal of persona] bitterness, but I - have no intention of following him along those lines. The honourable member is a most unfortunate exponent of the opinion he is supporting at the present time, that something should be done; because he happens to have been during his career in in the Queensland Parliament a follower of a government which, after supporting a motion for the subdivision of Queensland into three parts, took no further action' in the matter, although it was in absolute control of the affairs of the States. In the parliament in which the motion which the honourable member quotes with so much approval was brought forward, there was no upper bouse to restrict the actions of the Legislative Assembly, and the government itself had an ample majority, which would have enabled it to bring about the subdivision of Queensland so greatly desired by the honourable member. He was completely satisfied with the passing of a pious resolution, when there was no obstacle in the way of giving effect to it. It is unfortunate that the honourable member should take up in this Parliament the attitude he takes up now. When the right honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister in 1921, he introduced a bill for the summoning of a convention to consider the amendment of our Constitution, including, of course, the method of creating new States, which the honourable member says is of such urgent importance, and for which he says the Labour party has fought all the time; but the Leader of the n - Opposition ( Mr Charlton) moved, "" That the bill be read this day six months,"" which really meant shelving it . During the debate on that bill the Labour party had an opportunity to show its bona fides in regard to the matter. I took the opportunity to point out how the - proposed convention could do its work in the most satisfactory way> and I submitted amendments in accordance with the Country party's policy, which has just been read out by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr . Forde). Unfortunately, an honourable member moved, "" That the question be now put,"" and every member of the Labour party, with the exception of three, voted for that motion, in the belief that it was the quickest way of bringing about the desire of their Leader to shelve the matter altogether. That is what has occurred in this Parliament, and the honourable member for Capricornia can say nothing which will hide the facts. His further inconsistency is shown by his attitude to the motion of the honourable member for New England ( Mr . Thompson). If there is one thing more than anything else that is required to secure what he desires, and what every one knows I desire- a more satisfactory and economical system of government in Australia, and to give a bigger impetus to the development of what arc now outlying areas by the creation of new States-it is united action in this chamber by those who hold similar views. Yet the honourable member, for a quarter of an hour, indulged in a tirade of merciless abuse that cannot help the matter at all, whereas we need all the help we can in the fight for the conditions we think should be brought about in Australia. The honourable member said that those who are interested in this movement have done nothing during the last three years. The people outside have had an opportunity of judging the record of myself and others who stand for the establishment of new States. Not merely was the honourable member for New England ( Mr . Thompson), who stood by this'proposal, returned by an increased majority, and the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr R. Green) returned in the face of great opposition, but the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Abbott), who, during the whole campaign, advocated the creation of new States, defeated his opponent. The whole of northern New South Wales was thus solidly arrayed behind the New States Movement. The proposal of the honourable member for New England is to have a referendum on this issue, but he has accepted the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir, which the Government regards as the proper method of dealing with the question. Ministers think that the creation of new States should be dealt with in connection with the general amendment of the Constitution. When the right honourable member for Nort h Sydney ( Mr Hughes) brought down his proposal for a convention, that convention was to deal with the proposals for an alteration of the Constitution in a satisfactory and proper way. W it h other Ministers I have always contended that there is a much better chance of bringing about the creation of new States if , at the same time, some redistribution of the relative powers of the Commonwealth and the States can be secured, than by simply having a straight-out fight on the New States issue. The remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia. in regard to the proposals of the Labour party, show that that is also his opinion. I urge him, therefore, to set aside his personal feelings in the matter and j o in with others in the effort to see that this is done. As to why nothing was done in the matter during the last Parliament, despite the Prime Minister's assurance to a deputation that opportunity would be given for the discussion of changes of the Constitution by - Parliament, every one that when the Leader of the Labour party challenged the Government to go to the country on another issue, the Government accepted the challenge and fought that issue before the electors. But the dissolution abridged by nearly a year the life of that Parliament, and thus no opportunity was afforded to it to discuss proposals for the amendment of the Constitution. The Government has already announced that as soon as the new Parliament meets at Canberra it will have an opportunity of discussing proposed alterations of the Constitution, and the New States issue will be one of the matters discussed. Every one is agreed that it is time that wider means of securing the further subdivision of Australia than now exist should be devised. No subdivision can take place now except at the will of the Parliament which controls the territory where the people desire to subdivide. The time has come when I think there should be an alternative method of deciding the matter - whe n the people of a State, as well as the Parliament of the State, should have some say in it . A review of the history of the subdivision of Australia shows that there is very little chance of the subdivision of a State being brought about by an appeal to a State Parliament.. At the time of the separation of Victoria from. New Soutli Wales, a Legislative Council, which sat inSydney, controlled the' whole eastern portion of Australia. The Port Phillip District, as it was then known, had the privilege of returning six representatives to that body, but because of the difficulties of communication, due to the great distance ' separating Sydney from Melbourne, it was found necessary to select Sydney residents as its - representatives. The people of what is now Victoria, became absolutely sick of that system of government, and in despair elected Earl Grey, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, to represent them, because, although he was living in England, they said he could represent them just as well as any one living in Sydney. Finally, they secured self-government by an appeal to the British Parliament. They could never have got it from the New South Wales Parliament, because it is not natural for any parliament to give up any power it possesses or territory it controls. Queensknows land also wasseparated from New Sputh Wales as the result of a direct appeal to the Imperial Parliament. We claim now that the time is ripe when the Common-, wealth Parliament should be put practically in the position occupied by the I m perial Parliament prior to the establishmentof federation. But that matter we say should be determined, not by a referendum of the people on this particular issue, but along with other proposals to alter the Constitution and secure a redistribution of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. During the last three or four years State Parliaments have come to the conclusion that that is the proper method to be adopted. For instance, in the year 1922 Sir George Fuller, who was then Premier of New South Wales, wrote to the Prime Minister advising him that the following resolutions had been passed in the New South Wales Parliament: 1. That, in the opinion of this House, the large area of the State of New South Wales makes it desirable that the creation of a separate State in Northern New South Wales should be taken into early consideration by a Federal convention summoned for the purpose of reconsidering, both the present boundaries of the States and the distribution of the legishonorable member for Gwydir. lative powers between States and Commonwealth. 2. That this resolution be communicated to the Federal Government and the Governments of the States with a view to securing their concurrence. On the 4th October, 1922, the Queensland - Parliament passed this resolution : That, in the opinion of this Parliament, time has arrived for the remodelling of the Commonwealth Constitution, providing for the subdivision of Australia into a greater number of self-governing States, making for more economical and effective government, and also providing an easy'method for the people living in any district sucb as Central Queensland or Northern New South Wales, to obtain self government, and that the Prime Minister of Australia be urged to take the necessary steps to bring about these reforms. It is evident that, not merely in Federal circles, but also in the State Parliaments, and throughout Australia the opinion is held that the creation of new States oan be dealt with only in the course of a general review of the Constitution. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Gwydir proposes to refer this matter to the special constitutional session to be held next year, and the Government is quite prepared to accept the amendment and act upon it .",25
67,Mr HUGHES ,"No r t h Sydney) [3.53] - We had hoped to hear this afternoon from the honourable member for Melbourne ( Dr Maloney) a speech on his proposal for the compilation of another Domesday Book, and, incidentally, an historical survey dating from the Norman invasion of England. On that sea we were to have voyaged u n t i l 9 o'clock tonight, when the discussion of grievances is the order of the day. In place of that, this debate on the New States motion has been resumed, somewhat abruptly, and we have to address ourselves to it without the advantage of that preparation which makes for effective and interesting discussion. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) contrived, on the spur of the moment, to introduce into his speech a personal element, which at one stage promised to be highly entertaining. Unfortunately, I suppose the terms of the motion prevented him from doing full justice to the matter, and so we are left with no alternative but to deal with the proposal moved by the honourable member for New England ( MT . Thompson) and the amendment submitted by the The gravamen of the complaint of the honourable member for Capricornia was that the Treasurer had said that the New States movement had not flourished as it should have done because the Labour party had fallen down on the job. To which the honourable member for Capricornia replied, "" That is not the true. How could 29 members do that which requires the approval of a major it y of the House ? It is you who have fallen down on the j o b . "" The honourable member, in the course - of his speech, recalled to my mind the time when I had the honour of leading the Government, and the present Treasurer, sitting on the ministerial cross bench, delivered speeches on the New States movement, of which he was the chief banner-bearer. Many times we heard him wax eloquent upon this subject, and those who sat with him supported him with an enthusiasm that almost equalled his own. By the creation of new States we were to struggle out of the Slough of Despond and make our way to the celestial fields. But with the revolution of the political wheel the honourable member for Cowper was promoted to a position of authority. He may be imagined now as seated where he has merely to press an electric button, and l o ! in turn come for t h a budget, a sugar policy-abou t which we heard a good deal at one time-o r a shining array of new States. B ut these are as yet without substance. As for this New States movement, the bride is arrayed in her wedding finery; but the bridegroom cometh not - As in the song, the anxious bride, her once rosy cheeks pale and her manner depressed, is "" W a it in g at the Church,"" but in the language of the streets, "" There is nothing doing."" To adopt another metaphor, the Treasurer being haled into court, and electing to make a statement rather than enter the witne39 box where he could be cross-examinedmost defendants consider the first alternative the wiser course-tell s us the story, moving,> but not tragic, of the delay in realizing his fond dream during the last three years. He explained why he has found it impossible to proceed with this great reform of which he is the principal protagonist. The first year was taken up in rapt retrospect of that election campaign from which he appeared unlikely at one stage to emerge with much credit; but out of darkness came light, and he arrived breathless, but happy, where he is now. Then for twelve months his eyes were still dazzled with the unaccustomed glare, and action was impossible. In the next year, being then firmly in the saddle, might have been expected to take the jump, but for some unexplained reason he baulked the fence and arrived nowhere. The thir d year brought the shadow of things sufficiently ominous to damp his enthusiasm, and again he did nothing. Then followed the last general election-and here we fire. Stated in that way, the honourable gentleman's explanation covers the whole ground so amply as to leave not a chink through which the demon of doubt can enter. But I am bound to say that to those who believe in the New States movement-and I suppose there are still some who do-it is strange, to say the least, that the Treasurer has not been able to persuade his colleagues to do' anything to further this great reform. Because of his advocacy of i the got into public life, and when he still hesitant on the threshold, three years and four months of office, and after six years of unremitting public effort, one becomes a little doubtful whether anything can come of this movement. The Treasurer pointed out the difficulties in its way, but these are not new, and when a few years ago I "" ventured to point them out to him, he received them with every evidence of incredulity. I remember that a most enthusiastic deputation waited upon me at Tamworth. Nothing would serve those advocates of the New States movement but an amendment of the Constitution, by which a sure and speedy way would be found into the heart of the citadel. I pointed out that an amendment of the Constitution, as ordinarily understood, would bring them no nearer to their goal than the alternative method set out in that instrument. The fact cannot be over-emphasized that before a State can be subdivided its parliament must approve, and any amendment of the Constitution needs the consent of the majorit y of the people voting in a majority of the States. Before the Constitution can be amended to provide for the creation of new States, the proposal must have the approval not only of the majority of people voting in the majority of States, but also of a majorit y of the people in the State .to be cut up, and if it is desired to subdivide all the States, a majority of the people in all the States must be in favour of the subdivision. Human nature being he what it is, the day is very far distant when our fellow citizens will agree ""to such a proposal. A great State like ""Western Australia, where the citizens in the closely settled parts are so remote from those in the outlying provinces that they seem a world apart, is in an entirely different position from New South Wales, whose smaller area is gridironed by railways and roads, and whose people have a community, of feeling which inspires in them a more intense local patriotism. It is eminently desirable that there should repose in some authority means whereby at the proper stage of development in, any part of Australia new States may be created. Those who belong to the New States movement ought to be told plainly that no new States convention, and no amendment of the Constitution, will stands bring them nearer to their desire than after they are at this moment. When I ventured to recommend the Tamworth deputation to ask the Parliament of New South Wales to do that which they thought should be done-which , with certain reservations that I then stated, I favoured myself-the y despised the recommendation. Like Naaman, the Syrian, when told to bathe seven times in the Jordan, they asked were not Abana and Pharfar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel. They preferred to go the long way round to attain their objective. But they are no nearer to attaining it ; nay, they are further from the goal today than ever. The New States movement has been with time, and has served ing horse for political for individual politicians, who have used it for their own ends, but have done nothing to bring about a reform which they declare to be essential to the welfare of this country. There can be no subdivision of any State, without the consent of its people. If every elector in the Commonwealth, except those of favoured the subdivision of that Tasmania's "" No"" would Australia's "" Aye."" No counts in this matter majority of the. electors State which it is proposed divide. If it is desired to bring about the reform by first amending the Constitution, it will be necessary to get also a majority of the States and a majority of the people of Australia in favour of the proposed amendment. It has been suggested that an act of the British ment could be passed our 'Constitution; but British Parliament to pass such a measure would be an affront to the dignity of the Commonwealth, people would not tolerate. tion is the charter of our rights, and, although it is in form statute, it was approved by the people of this country before the British ment was asked to give it legal sanction. It is now, in fact, no longer a British statute; it is the charter of our liberties and rights, and we alone ought to say what shall be done with it. I should oppose tooth and nail a proposal for the creation of new States by a statute of the British Parliament. I say against the holding of a convention-I believe in it-but, case, the situation to be faced will be the same. It was suggested to me at Tamworth-and the honourable member for New England seems to hold the same view-that there is some way of evading the difficulty. There is no way of evading it. If it is desired to substitute for section 128 of the Constitution an entirely new section, under which what we wish to do could be done, there is no way by which that can be made except that provided section 128as it exists. The of the people of the States out of which new States are to be carved, must apMr Hughet. as a stalk- prove of the amendment. The advocates parties, and of new States should realise that. If public opinion on this subject were sufficiently strong to make it an election issue, it would not necessarily follow that the people would give the authority needed to consummate the purpose in view. But the New States question, which was continually dinned in our ears a few years Tasmania, ago, has now become a faint and State, negligible echo.",27
68,Mr RODGERS ,The movement started majority in a parochial instead of a national way.,29
69,Mr HUGHES ,"I have not said that. of the I am content to declare myself to sub- in favour of the creation of means for making new States from time to time as the development of the Commonwealth may require.

70,Mr THOMPSON ,"New England) [4.16] - I accept the amendment with apParlia- proval, because it is the suggestion of the Government, and provides the most sensible way out of this difficulty. This debate has shown that great constitutional difficulties surround this matter which require the consideration of honourable members at a special constitutional session. We have had the definite announcenothing ment of the Government that next year constitutional - presumabl y when we are at Canberrain any there will be a special session to deal with constitutional issues. That is one of the most important statements that has been made by the Government since this Parliament came into existence, because it opens up a vista of big possibilities for Australia. As secretary to the All Australian New State Movement, and to the Northern New South Wales Movement particularly, which have ardently advocated the subdivision of the State, I amendment can safely say that the proposal of the by Government to accept this matter as a majority question for the agenda-paper at the special constitutional session is entirely acceptable. If we decide to hold a referendum on the subject during the life of this Parliament, we shall still be faced with constitutional difficulties in establishing the new States. For that reason it is better, especially as this Parliament has from two and a half to three years to go, to relegate this question to a special constitutional session. At such a session there will be a different atmosphere from that existing today. Although tais question has been threshed out from one end of Australia to the other, and although the Labour party has flaunted its unification scheme before the people for several years, there are, when it is being discussed here today, empty benches on the Labour side. When honourable members of the Labour party have an opportunity to discuss their unification proposals, their interest in them appears so small that, with the exception of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr . Forde), they have not participated in the debate or even remained to hear the discussion.",29

Although I am not afraid of the name I do not consider myself a unificationist, because I would substitute for the present State Parliaments, provincial Parliaments clothed with limited power, such as operate now in Canada and South Africa .",30
78,Mr THOMPSON ,"We do not suggest that new State Parliaments, with powers such as are possessed by thosenow in operation, should be established.",30
79,Mr FENTON,"-It would be folly in every sense of the word to enlarge the number of such - parliaments in - Australia. The desire of the Labour party, as I think the overwhelming majorit y of our people understand, is to substitute for the existing State Parliaments provincial parliaments which will act withi n the authority conferred upon them by the National Parliament. I am not a unificationist in the sense that I favour only one Parliament for the Commonwealth; but during the twenty years I have been in public l if e I have advocated, on both Federal and State platforms, increasing the power of the National Parliament and decreasing that of the State Parliaments. I have said without equivocation that the State Parliaments must decrease, and the Commonwealth Parliament increase in importance and power. That view is in accord with ""the sentiments of the great m a j o r it y of the Australian people. It has been said that the Labour party is seeking to deprive our people bf home rule, but if we had our way we would give a greater measure of home rule than the people formed.] now enjoy, for we would bring them into closer contact with their governing authorities. I object to this piece-meal I method of dealing with the new States issue. This Parliament should consider the interests, not only of Queensland and There New South Wales, but of all the States. Western Australia, for instance, is just as much entitled to a subdivision of her territory as New South Wales, Victoria , or Queensland. I believe in decentralization. A few days ago, when I suggested, in the course of a debate, that Australia could, with ' benefit to the people, be divided into twenty provinces, each with a population of 300,000, the Attorney-General ( Mr Latham) interjected that Sydney itself, would, in that case, contain about three provinces. I do not suggest anything like that. I consider that capital cities with a community of interests should have provincial parliaments of their own; but I do not think that provincial parliaments in sparsely-populated areas should have as many members as provincial parliaments in the capital cities. Our Federal system of dividing the Commonwealth into electoral divisions with a community of interests, is excellent. In any new State subdivisions that I might suggest, I should pay no heed whatever to the present State boundaries. As the people on the borders of Queensland and New South Wales have similar interests, I should forget the imaginary line that separates the two States; and, as the people in the northern part of Victoria and the Riverina,' in New South Wales, also have like interests, I sliould pay no attention to the fact that the .Murray River is the present State boundary. I regret that our population is centred in our metropolitan areas; but, in my opinion, the setting up of provincial parliaments such as I have proposed would counteract centralization. I should not think of providing separate governors and agents-general for the new States, nor of setting up two houses of parliament in them. We shall never secure any real financial reforms u n t il the spheres of Federal and State activity have been substantially altered.",30
80,Dr EARLE PAGE ,In which direction?,31
81,Mr FENTON ,I should place all our big national services under the trol of the Commonwealth.,31
82,Dr EARLE PAGE ,Would the. honorin able member make the Commonwealth the controlling authority in finance?,31
83,Mr FENTON ,"Yes ; I consider would be wise for the people to give Parliament unlimited power, and allow to take over the State debts. Mr THOMT>SOTV - Would the honourable member be in favour of the Commonand wealth Parliament delegating powers the provincial parliaments from time time ?",31
84,Mr FENTON ,"I would. It is most unfortunate that section 128 is in the Constitution. The concluding paragraph of it readsNo alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of any State in either House of the Parliament or the minimum number of representatives of a State dn the House of Representatives, or increasing, diminishing, or otherwise altering the limits of the State, or in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation thereto, shall become law unless the majority of the electors voting in that State approve the proposed law.",31
85,Mr THOMPSON ,-That spoils our whole Federal system.,31
86,Mr FENTON ,"I do not propose to enter into a discussion of the legal aspect of the matter, but, in my opinion, the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney ( Mr Hughes) has stated the case correctly.",31
87,Dr EARLE PAGE ,What we suggest is that both people and Parliament should have the right to take action.,31
88,Mr FENTON ,"As things are now, although five States in the Commonwealth determined on an alteration, Tasmania, our smallest State, could, with a majority of only two votes, prevent it from being made; and that is an intolerable position. From a propaganda point of view, a constitutional session might help us in this matter. I believe that if I were to conduct a vigorous campaign in the Mari byrnong electorate, and the main plank of my platform was unification, my majority would be increased rather than diminished. I , therefore, have no fear of being called a unificationist, but it is not fair to describe the whole of the members of the Labour party as unificationists, though it is true that some members of the party propounded a tencontative scheme for discussion. The honourable member for Lang ( Sir Ellio t Johnson) said that he does not believe the creation of new States, because the result would be to impose further burdens upon the taxpayers. We might have it twenty provincial parliaments, each of this which would have a comparatively small it area to look after and fewer powers than are now possessed by the State Parliaments. Big questions such as the control of railways, the floating of loans, so on, could be dealt with in the to Federal arena. The provincial parliato ments might be given some of the powers now possessed by our State Parliaments, and might, in addition, be given power to deal with questions which are now dealt with by municipal authorities. By the adoption of such a system, we should have something like real home rule. The provincial parliaments would not be in vested with all the pomp and glory of our present State Parliaments, but the people they would control would be much better governed than are the people of the States under existing conditions. This Parliament, freed from its fetters, could be run on truly national lines, and would be able to do far more for the people than it can do now. We are desirous in this Parliament of doing great things for the people, but the Constitution calls a halt whenever we propose to make an advance.",31
89,Mr THOMPSON ,The Constitution can be altered.,32
90,Mr FENTON ,"That is so, but it is a most difficult matter to alter it . I hav6 often said that in our Constitution we have too slavishly followed the United States' Constitution, and would have done better if we had followed the Canadian Constitution.",32
91,Mr THOMPSON ,"So far as the establishment of new states is concerned, it is much worse than the Constitution of the United States of America.",32
92,Mr FENTON ,"It might not be as suitable for the settlement of some questions, but, speaking generally, we have, in Australia, followed the Constitution of the United States of America too closely. I remind honourable members of the statement made by General Smuts when the framing of a Constitution for South Africa was under consideration. He said .that they had avoided the mistakes made by the Australian people. They retained for the Federal Parliament full industrial powers over railways and many other activities which the Australian people failed to do. The framers of the South African Constitution were advised to avoid the mistakes we made. I say nothing to the in j u r y of the memory of the late Alfred Deakin, or to the repuNA that these gentlemen, when members of the same Government, advised the people charged with the framing of a constitution for South Africa , to avoid the mistake made in Australia of copying too slavishly the Constitution of the United States of America.",32
93,Mr THOMPSON ,The South African provincial experiment has failed.,32
94,Mr FENTON ,I do not know that it has.,32
95,Mr THOMPSON ,They have had half a dozen commissions inquiring into it .,32
96,Mr FENTON ,"We required a flexible constitution which could be alteredand adjusted to meet altered circumstances ; but we copied a constitution that was 125 years old. We need to reduce the powers of the ' State Parliaments and to increase the powers of the Federal Parliament. In the place of our present State Parliaments, we should have provincial parliaments of one house only. All these questions of detail could bo worked out later. I am not satisfied that we should be able to effect the savings that are so necessary. W it h 20 provincial parliaments, comprised of 30 members each, we would have about the same number of members of Parliament that we have in Australia today, excluding the Federal Parliament.",32
97,Mr THOMPSON ,How many members should there be in a provincial parliament ?,32
98,Mr FENTON ,"I have put the number, roughly, at 30.",32
99,Dr EARLE PAGE ,How many senators should there be?,32
100,Mr FENTON ,The honourable gentleman wants to know how many senators there should be in the national Parliament. That is a detail which could be carefully considered. I do not say that it would not be necessary to increase the - membership of the Federal Parliament.,32
101,Mr THOMPSON ,Is the Labour party in favour of abolishing the Senate?,32
102,Mr FENTON ,"Yes . I see very little use in the Senate or in any upper house in any country in the world, beginning with the House of Lords. If I had my way, I should abolish the House of Lords. It is, in my mind, iniquitous - that there should be hereditary peers, and that persons belonging to one section of the Christian church should be entitled to seats in the House of Lords to the exclusion of - persons belonging to other sections of the church.",32
103,Mr THOMPSON ,Does the Labour party provide in its new scheme for the abolition of the Senate?,32
104,Mr FENTON ,"The abolition, of the Senate and of all upper houses in Australia is a part of the Labour party's platform. When our system of government is brought into greater conformity with modern ideas, the eyes of the world will be turned upon us mucb less critically than tbey are at the present time. Australia, as at present governed, is the laughing stock of the world.",32
105,Mr ABBOTT ,On e person in every seven of our population of Australia is a public servant.,33
106,Mr FENTON,"We are often reminded of that, but, so far as the Public Service is .concerned, the question is whether the members of it are doing their duty and earning their salaries. Some will complain that, if the Commonwealth took over the control of the railways, they would all be controlled from Canberra. That complaint would be made in' every State with the exception of New South Wales. Already,, in the daily press of this State, we are being told that the Federal Parliament is going to Canberra, that it will be far away, and goodness knows what will happen when everything is run from the Federal Capital. Australia is a country of great distances, and yet I would remind honourable members of the wonderful service that is rendered to the people by the Postmaster-General's Department - Its benefits are extended to every little hamlet in Australia, as well as to. the great cities. Every one will admit the value of the sendees rendered by the Postal Department and the importance of the work that it is doing for Australia. It is, under Federal auspices, doing better work than it did when controlled by the several States. Tf the Federal authority can carry out such good work in the extension of postal facilities to the people, there is no reason why it should not be able to do equally good work if it controlled the railways of the Commonwealth in the same way.",33
107,Mr THOMPSON ,"Does the honourable - member believe, that railways in the north-west of Western Australia could be properly manaated from Canberra?",33
108,Mr FENTON ,"They would not be managed from Canberra. Postal affairs in Western Australia are not managed from Melbourne; they are managed from Perth by the Deputy Director-General for Western Australia. The central administration will be at Canberra, but it will be the Deputy Directors who will really administer the affairs of the Postal Department in the various States. They are doing that work now, and are doing it well.",33
109,Mr THOMPSON ,Has the Labour party any proposal for an amendment of 'the Constitution to bring its scheme into effect?,33
110,Mr FENTON ,"If the Labour party was in power it would not only propound a scheme of government for Australia, but it would submit it for consideration either at a special session of the Parliament or"" to the people by way of referendum. The creation of new States is only one matter in connection with which amendments of the Constitution are required. We pledged ourselves at the 1910 election that if the Labour party were returned it would repeal the Naval Loan Act. That was believed by many people to be an awful proposal, but we did repeal it. The Labour party was in power for only a few months when that act was removed from the statute-book; and we made a start with the establishment of an Australian Navy on Australian lines. We said that if returned to power the people would be given an opportunity to amend the Constitution, and they were given such an opportunity in 1911, when proposals for the amendment of the Constitution were submitted to them.",33
111,Mr THOMPSON ,The Labour party does not say that it will follow that course in connection with its new scheme.,33
112,Mr FENTON ,"We have our own scheme, and it will be put forward at the proper time. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) and the honourable member for New England have accepted the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gwydir ( Mr Abbott). There is no doubt that it will be carried, and the question dealt with by the motion will be remitted to a constitutional session of the Parliament at Canberra. I rose chiefly to refute some statements made by the honourable member for New England, suggesting that the Labour party is in favour of unification. He has said that the Labour party's scheme is a unification scheme.",33
113,Mr THOMPSON ,Member s of the party have always so described it.,33
114,Mr FENTON ,"Doubtles s there are rash members in the Labour party, as well as in the party opposite, who sometimes make use of terms without considering their exact meaning. I have said that, personally, I do not fear to be called a unificationist, but I do not think the term should be applied to the' Labour party as a whole. I have tried to outline the policy of the party to replace the existing State Parliaments by provincial parliaments, and to establish a federal system of government suited to the circumstances of Australia. A federal system suited to Australia would not be suited to South A f r i c a , where a different territory and different classes of people require a different for m of government. We should suit ourselves to our circumstances, and that is why I say we made a big mistake in copying what was done by people on the other side of the world.",33
115,Mr THOMPSON ,We did not copy the United States of America.,34
116,Mr FENTON ,"In some directions we did not, but in other directions we followed the Constitution of the United States nf America too closely. If . alive '. well I hope to take part in the proposed constitutional In the meantime I hope the Government will be fortified by the best legal advice as to what the Constitution means. We do not want to put people to the trouble of going to the courts to ascertain what it means. I hope that whatever alterations are made will be framed in such clear and unambiguous language that he who runs may read our law and be able to obey it . I am prepared to defer the further consideration of this question until we can have a constitutional session, and I hope that as a result of the deliberations of that session we shall be in a position to ask the people to accept some most desirable constitutional amendments.",34
117,Mr FORDE ,"Capricornia) [ 4 . 5 3 ] - I understand that the honourable member for New England ( Mr Thompson) has agreed to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for G'wydk ( Mr Abbott) that the method of establishing new States should be considered along with other constitutional questions at the proposed constitutional session of this Parliament. I have always been very reasonable on this matter. chief object in. speaking today was to prevent the motion from being delayed for another three weeks, as the Treasurer suggested that it should be. Although I Was not actually prepared to speak to the motion, I realized that further delay would be most unfair to the supporters of the New States movement who want some definite pronouncement from the Government on the question. If my speech did nothing more than provoke the Treasurer to state his attitude on the matter, and what he in tends to do to give effect to his election promises, it has done some good. I am glad to find that the Treasurer has now announced that the Government will consider this question at the constitutional session to be held at Canberra next year. All I ask in that regard is that the Government shall carry out its promise; because I have in mind the definite promise made by the Prime Minister in 1923 that the question would be dealt with at a constitutional session of this Parliament in 1924, and nothing was done to carry out that promise. It is the duty of the honourable member for New England and others who take an interest in the New States movement to see that the Government adheres to the promise session. that it has made today, but I feel sure that it would not have been made but for my criticism of the Treasurer for his apathy and indifference towards a matter which was mainly responsible for his election to this Parliament. I made.no personal references to the Treasurer. I have absolutely nothing against the honourable member personally. My criticism of him was solely of a poli-bieal kind, but it would have been cowardly on my part if I had said nothing on behalf of a movement in which I have taken a very keen interest. I disagree in certain respects with a number of sup^ porters of the New States movement. For instance, some of them would establish a' number of additional State parliaments.",34
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,The honourable member has already spoken to the motion. He must now confine his remarks to the amendment.,34
119,Mr FORDE ,"I am dealing with the amendment. I cannot join with those supporters of the New States movement who would create additional State 'parliaments with upper houses and departMy ments which would multiply the cost of government in Australia. I have always held that the Commonwealth should be the sovereign authority, with a number of subordinate provincial councils or - State parliaments.",34
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,The honourable member is still going beyond the amendment.,34
121,Mr FORDE ,I recognize that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gwydir proposes to defer the question u n t i l the constitutional session is held next year.,35
122,Mr MATHEWS ,That means nothing.,35
123,Mr FORDE ,"It means that the Government is not prepared to deal with the matter at the present time. It s decision will not mest with the approval of the New States League of Central Queensland, which has written to me as follows : At a meeting of the Executive, held on the 23rd March, I was requested to convey to you the following resolution:"" That this meeting is against the suggestion that the referendum on the matter of amendment of the Federal Constitution to give the Commonwealth Parliament power .to create new States, should be bracketed with other extraneous matters, and affirm the fact that the suggested amendment of the Constitution in regard to the creation of new States is so important nationally that it should be submitted to the electors as a single and that the elimination of the State Government's veto, and the vesting of the power of creating new States in the Com-, monwealth Parliament he put as briefly and simply as possible, so that the electors be not confused."" A copy of that lesolution was sent to the secretary of the Parliamentary New States Committee, of which the honourable member for Wew England is secretary. The memnors of this league will be disappointed to learn that the Government will not submit the New States issue at a separate referendum.",35
124,Dr EARLE PAGE ,"The honourable .memhas received my reply to that communication, stating definitely the Government's attitude.",35
125,Mr FORDE ,"I know that I sent the communication to the Treasurer, and that he furnished me with a reply. ever, the Government has its majority, and we have now its definite promise that the matter will be dealt with at the constitutional session. It is not my in tention to vote against the amendment. As a matter of fact, I must accept it , because it is the best we can get under the circumstances. At the constitutional session, honourable members of all parties will have ample opportunity to discuss the Government's proposals, and submit amendments. It is a big step forward, for those who desire the creation of new States, to have succeeded in inducing the Treasurer to announce the Government's policy, and arouse him out of the state of apathy in regard to the question into which he has fallen since he took office four and a half years ago. The honourable member for New England has done good work in trying to induce the Government to take some action; but it was, of course, impossible to get the Treasurer to say in this House what his attitude during the last four and a half years was. When I attacked the Treasurer's political actions, and his indifference to the New States movement, he made the lame excuse that I was making a personal attack upon him. I attempted no such thing. The Treasurer is responsible to his own electors; but honourable members here are entitled to point to any breach of faith on his part.",35
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,The honourable member is again going beyond the scope of the amendment.,35
127,Mr FORDE ,"I am keeping the issue, amendment in mind. I have also in mind that a very evasive Treasurer has sidetracked this matter long enough. I propose to see that he lives right up to his election promises in regard to the New States question.",35
128,Mr THOMPSON ,"New England) [5.1] - My action in submitting my motion twice within the last three years has been full y justified by the discussion we have had upon it today. At last we have had a definite pronouncement as to the attitude of the Government. W it h that attitude, I for the present entirely agree. I have already explained why I have accepted the amendment, and there is no need for me to go over that ground again. I do not seek to take undue credit for being consistent in my advocacy of the New States cause in this ParliaHow- ment. I appreciate the frequent references of the honourable member for Capricornia to the subject; but T cannot allow this occasion to pass without reminding the honourable member that he has assiduously avoided taking an active part in the Parliamentary New States movement. I have no wish to divulge the nature of conversations I have had with the honourable member, but he has had every opportunity to join the Parliamentary League. He declined very definitely, for the reason that the leaeue was not actually working along the lines in which his party believed. I thought it was a very reasonable attitude for him to take up; but I am surprised that he did not stand up to it in Capricornia, where the Central Queensland New States movement is fairly active. H a d he done so, I could have admired his consistency more than I do.",35
129,Mr FORDE ,"In January last I called a meeting of the New States League in Central Queensland, aud explained my reasons for not joining the Parliamentary Committee. These reasons were published in the issue of the Rockhampton Miner for the 5th January last.",36
130,Mr THOMPSON ,"I accept the honourable member's assurance. He is, I think, sincere in his advocacy of new States. He attended two big conventions at Armidale, and made .speeches that greatly impressed the 300 delegates present on each occasion. As a personal friend of the honourable member, I should be sorry to think that he could speak as he did on those occasions, and at other conferences, if he were not sincere. look forward to active co-operation, henceforth, with him in preparing the case which the New-Staters hope to present to this Parliament when it meets for a constitutional session at Canberra next year.",36
131,Mr FORDE ,"The trouble is that some of the honourable member's friends import party politics into this movement, to the detriment of the Labour party.",36
132,Mr THOMPSON ,"Some people may have done that, but I hope I have never been guilty of such tactics. This is a non-party question. The speech delivered by the honourable member for M a r i byrnong ( Mr Fenton) disclosed the need for forcing even the Labour party to submit definite proposals. The honourable member said that that party has varied the unification scheme originally disclosed in this House by the honourable member for Dalley ( Mr Mahony), in 1920. Bearing the title Unification, a pamphlet has been widely distributed, with the result that a large number of people regard the "" scheme put forward by the Labour party as a straight-out proposal for unification. W it h the principle of that scheme, I have no disagreement, but I think it is waste of time for any party to advocate the abrogation of the Federal compact. The people of Australia accepted federation on the understanding that the Federal principle would be observed. The great weakness in the scheme of unification, originally propounded by the Labour party, was that it definitely abrogated the Federal compact and proposed the substitution of an entirely new system of government. We have been assured today by the honourable member for Maribyrnong and the honourable member for Capricornia that, at the instigation of Mr Theodore, the Labour party has adopted a modified scheme, which is not essentially unification. If this debate has done nothing more than disclose that important fact, it has been well worthwhile. Although the Labour party is not in power in this Parliament today, it has held office in the past, and will probably do so in the future. It is a great party, representing a large number of people, and if it has a proposal that is v it a l . to the welfare of Australia, it should disclose both the principles and the details of it . The I original scheme did include such details as the granting of constitutions to municipal and shire councils. The sooner the Labour party submits its revised scheme of subdivision to the people, the better. The agitators in the New States movement may take credit to themselves for having forced the Labour party to advocate a definite scheme of constitutional reform to permit of the further subdivision of Australia. As a party, it has not consistently advocated unification; that has been done spasmodically by in dividual members, but the party appeared to sponsor the scheme. The only means by which the Labour party can bring its .proposals before the people, is an agitation such as the New Staters have conducted, which has led to an important declaration by the Commonwealth Government that the claims of the movement will be considered at the constitutional session. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney ( Mr Hughes) dealt in characteristic fashion with this matter, but, although he has claims to be regarded as a constitutional authority, his declaration thut it would be impossible to amend section 128 did not help us very much. The framers of the Constitution evidently designed that section to prevent the subdivision of a State without the consent of its local legislature. At the time when the people accepted that provision, they could have had no idea of its effect, but after 25 years of federation, we know that it definitely prevents the creation of new States, except in Commonwealth tories. This Parliament has already provided machinery for the establishment of two new States in the Northern tory, but many years may elapse before the population there is sufficiently to justify the operation of that nery. I do not think the founders of the Commonwealth intended should forever consist of only the six existing States. In Western Queensland, and New South Wales, where subdivision movements have been fairly strong at times, the matter has been debated by the State legislatures, but even when they decided to accept the principle of subdivision they always referred scheme back to the Commonwealth liament. Therefore, unless section 128 is amended, the impossibility of creating new States without the consent of the State Parliaments will continue. 25 years of federation not one State Parliament has consented to the establishment of a new State within its boundaries. The Parliament of New Wales expressed the opinion that State should be subdivided, but referred the matter to the Commonwealth ment. A royal commission South Wales, which spent £25,000 in the collecting of evidence and generally investigating this matter, reported that it was neither practicable nor desirable to create new States within New Wales. We must, therefore, turn back to where we started 25 years ago, and ask the people to agree to the deletion of section 128, or to insert in the Constitution a provision giving to this power to create new States. The longer that step is delayed the more difficult it will become. In all the States the population in the capital cities is becoming greater, vested and political more powerful, and the voice of the rural interests feebler. If we delay action for another twenty years it will be practically impossible to agitate in the rural areas for the Creation of new States. Now is the time to act. The right honourable member North Sydney ( Mr Hughes) said that under the present Constitution sent of the majority of the people voting in the majority of States must be obtained before this Parliament can begin create a new State without the consent Mr Thompson. of the State Parliament concerned. As an afterthought, he added, that if any State did not record the necessary Terri- majority of Votes in favour of the proposal, no subdivision could take place within its boundaries. If that opinion Terri- is correct the meaning of the Constitution is this: If a majority in large favour of the creation of new States machi- were obtained in four of the existing States, and the majority of that it the people of the Commonwealth were of the same opinion, subdivision proposals Australia, could be put into operation in those four States without the consent of the local Parliament, but not in the two dissenting States. If five States consented and Victoria dissented, the five could be subdivided, but Victoria could not be. That, the I know, is the opinion held by the At Par- torney-General ( Mr Latham), but even if it is correct it is not impossible to secure the necessary majority of votes so that this Parliament can subdivide four In the or five of the existing States. If that step were taken the force of example might operate to induce the dissenting States to surrender the necessary power South to the Commonwealth. It is not imthat possible for this Parliament to secure a majority in all the six' States in favour Parlia- of subdivision. If this matter were rein New moved from the arena of party politics, and the two great parties in this Parliament unitedly asked the people to amend or repeal section 128, and the other provisions relating to new South States, and to give to this Parliament absolute power to create new States when and in such manner as circumstances might dictate, the overwhelming majority of the people would assent. But Parliament if one party goes to the people with a scheme, and another party advocates a proposal that is the same' in essence but not in details, both will be courting defeat. I hope that between now and the interests constitutional session to be held at Canberra, various projects for obtaining taking constitutional authority . to subdivide Australia will be devised, and that the successfully Labour party will seize the opportunity to spread its so-called unification gospel amongst the people. It should not confor tinue to sit down' on the job as it has been doing during the last four years. the con- If it will explain its scheme to the people, by the time the constitutional session is held a weighty public opinion to in favour of subdivision will have been created. I assure members of the Labour party that the leaders of the New States movement, who in the past have bumped, their heads against brick walls, will rest rio longer. They have explored every constitutional means of getting new States created with the consent of the State legislatures, but owing to the powerful influence of city interests they have always failed. If , however, it is definitely decided that the Federal Parliament shall tackle the question, and that within the next two and a half years the necessary amendments to the Constitution will be submitted to the people as a major issue, there will be no cause for further complaint about the apathy or lethargy of those engaged in the - movement. Of what avail is it for people to be alert and enthusiastic when they are continually told that their proposals are hopeless, that they are up against a constitutional dead-end. and that they had better accept things as they are? When they see that there is a chance of achieving something they will continue the fight with renewed zest. When they were led to believe that if they agitated they would be able to swing the State Parliaments behind their movement, they were full of life and hope, and they worked to such good purpose that for two or three years the creation of new States was the most widely discussed question in Australian politics. But when they found that their efforts were .useless, and that they always came back to the dead end of section 128 of the Constitution, they decided that, until Parliament would take the cause in hand, they would not waste more of their time and substance on it . They subsided, and left the job to be done by the politicians. I happen to be one of the politicians to whom the job was left. One honourable member has said that I have pursued the subject to distraction in this House. I have consistently tried to bring it uncier the notice of this Parliament, and I hope that it will be evident, in a few minutes, that I have done so with success. I hope that the Government will not. regard the carrying of this amendment as the shelving jof the question', but rather as. a definite instrnr-tion from this Parliament that it should set its constitutional authorities to work to try to devise suggestions to place before the people. Those suggestions should be made, not two or three weeks before the constitututional session, but as soon as possible, so that they may be considered and thoroughly discussed by the people.",36
133,Mr FORDE ,"I wish to make a personal explanation. The honourable member for New England ( Mr Thompson) said that he sympathized with me for not joining the Parliamentary New States Committee, but that I had been inconsistent in not going to Central Queensland and telling the electors there why I would not join the committee. He is not correct in saying that I was inconsistent, for I wrote to the Central Queensland New States League, and told it that I was not prepared to join the parliamentary committee, and asked it to"" convene a meeting on the subject. That meeting, was held on the 4th January, and I attended and clearly gave my reasons for not joining the committee. I have an extract from a newspaper report, of the meeting, at which I definitely stated that I considered that the Government, which had a following comprising a majority of members of the Parliament, should submit its policy. I told them that the members of the Labour party, although they were not prepared to join the committee, would give the question full consideration, but would not consent to be dragged at the heels of any other party. Amendment agreed to. Question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative. EAILWAY CONSTRUCTION. Debate, resumed from 25th February (vide page 1150), on motion by Mr . MANNINGThat it is essential for the proper development of Northern Australia that a railway be constructed from Bourke, New South Wales, through Central Queensland towards Cloncurry, and thence across the Barkly Tablelands to a point on the North-South Railway in the Northern Territory-the carrying of this resolution to be taken as an instruction from this House, to the Government to approach the State Governments of New South Wales and Queensland with a view of apportioning the expense of constructing this line between the Commonwealth and the States mentioned. Upon which Mr GREGORY had moved, by way of amendment That all the words after the words "" constructed from "" up to an inclusive of the words ""Northern Territory"" be omitted with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the words "" Broome or Derby starting in an easterly direction vx> to its junction with the North-South Railway at or about Newcastle Waters, thence south of east to Camooweal.'' MT . MACKAY (Lilley) [5.25] - The motion of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) refers to an important railway proposal which is undoubtedly necessary for the development, not only of a portion of the Northern Territory, but also of a very large area in Queensland. As the Commonwealth Parliament has already decided on the construction of the north-south line, which will connect. Darwin with Port Augusta, the motion should not excite suspicion in the minds of those honourable members who represent South Australian constituencies. There is undoubtedly room for anumber of railways in the Northern Territory, and this proposal meets requirements only in one direction. I regret that the honourable member for Swan moved an amendment. to the motion. He did not, however, oppose the motion, but said that he thought the construction of the line proposed in his amendment should be the first step in railway construction after the construcof the north-south line. If his amendment had been a separate motion, it would undoubtedly have had the support of the majority of honourable members. There can be no doubt that the Northern Territory in the future will need a number of railways, and as the suggestion of the honourable member for Swan is that a railway should be built to the West, and the suggestion of the honourable member for Macquarie is that one should be built to the east, the two proposals are not in conflict. The honourable member for Macquarie dealt exhaustively with the pastoral possibilities of the Barkly Tablelands, and generally his speech corroborated the statements of many persons who have personal knowledge of that portion of the Territory. I wish to quote one or two authorities who have not been mentioned in the debate. Last year the Commonwealth Government asked Sir George Buchanan, K . C . I . E . , an eminent engineer, to express his opinion on certain developmental problems in the Northern Territory, and in his report, which has been issued as a parliamentary paper, he said, "" I feel satisfied that the development of the Northern Territory must begin through Queensland, and, in the first instance, by an extension of the pastoral industry."" A f t e r referring to a report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, which in quired very closely into the question of railway construction in the Northern Territory, he said : I believe that the interests of the country would be best served by building, as soon as possible, the railway to Camooweal, and I suggest construction should take place similtaneously from Camooweal North, and from Emungalan South, and that the Queensland Government should be urged to construct at once, the line from Cloncurry to Camooweal, thus bringing the Queensland railway system to the frontier of the Nortliern Territory. Mr Bell, the Commonwealth Commissioner of Railways, in giving evidence before the committee, said: The Bourke-Camooweal connection would be of immense advantage to Australia, and must be built eventually. The Queensland portion of the route was approved by the Queensland Parliament fifteen years ago. The route would give the Northern Territory the advantage of direGt access to the tremendously big Sydney market. A glance at the map of Australia shows that Queensland can justly claim to have the best planned system of railways in the Commonwealth. I u the matter of accidents, it has a record that compares favourably with that of any other railway system. In that State there are 6,147 miles of government railways open for traffic, and they have been built at a capital cost of £52,000,000. There is a railway from the port of Townsville running due west via Cloncurry to Dajarra, which is 120 miles from Camooweal, and on the border of the Territory. That line is 640 miles in length. The line proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie across the Tablelands could be connected at Dajarra or Cloncurry, and direct communication could thus be provided with the seaboard at Townsville. We have a useful line running from Rockhampton due west to Yaraka, through the rich central districts of Queensland, a distance of 475 miles. In addition, there is the Brisbane to Quilpie line of 624 miles, and quite recently the coastal line of 1,042 miles has been completed connecting Brisbane with Cairns in the far north. Great credit is due to the past statesni&j of Queensland, who looked into the future before planning the railway system of that State. Their foresight has undoubtedly led to the establishment of large centres of population outside the capital city, and there is no 'doubt that the motion offers a splendid opportunity for further developing the back country of Queensland. The Queensland Parliament has already given its approval to a proposal for a railway line from Camooweal, toconnect up all the rail heads I have mentioned with Tobermory, which is within 250 miles of Hungerford on the border of New South Wales, and that would establish connection with Bourke and Sydney. In my opinion, this railway could be quickly and economically constructed, because there are four existing railheads adjacent to the suffffested route. No difficulty need be anticipated in the Commonwealth and State Governments reaching an agreement on the matter; and development would occur that would undoubtedly lead to the settlement of a big population. Quenseland does not expect Commonwealth Government to provide the whole construction cost; all she desires is that the matter shall be dealt, with on a business basis. parties that would benefit by the construction of the line should contribute to its cost, and the Commonwealth would undoubtedly benefit, for the railway would tap the valuable Barkly Tableland. I should like part of the £34,000,000 that Great Britain has offered to the Commonwealth and States allocated to the building of this railway, as it would provide employment for immigrants, and would absorb all the unemployed in the Commonwealth, as' well as a large number of migrants from overseas.",38
134,Mr MANNING ,"It is essentially a developmental line, and would come within the terms of the agreement.",40
135,Mr MACKAY ,"That is my opinion. The history of railway construction indicates that a proportion of the men engaged on work like this select a piece of land near the railway when it is completed and settle there; and undoubtedly some of the immigrants would be glad to get such excellent country. Many people shudder at our Commonwealth and State public debt of £160 per head of the population; but it must be remembered that we have tens of thousands of miles of railways, harbour improvements, roads and - bridges, and many other valuable permanent works to set against it .",40
136,Mr FOSTER ,Will the honourable member tell us the total loss on the working of our railways in the last ten years? 1 3505,40
137,Mr MACKAY ,"I have not the figures by'me . The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) is inclined to forget that Australia is just emerging from the pioneering stage of her development. Future generations will marvel at the manner in which we have surmounted our difficulties. In my opinion, there is no reason whatever for pessimism. Wc must build railways to develop our country. It is foolish, in my. opinion, to expect people to settle on areas that lie from 100 to 150 miles away from a railway line. We should make our railways first, and then send settlers forward to undertake developmental enterprises. We should not hesitate to borrow money to build developmental railways into good country. I trust that the honourable member for Swan ( Mr . the Greeory) will withdraw his amendment and give us the opportunity to record a straight-out vote on the motion. If , later, he saw fit to introduce his amendment in All the the for m of a motion, I am sure that practically every honourable member would support it .",40
138,Dr NOTT ,"Herbert) [ 5 . 4 3 ] - I support the motion. Certain interjections that were hurled at the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) when he introduced it , notably those by the NA sons), indicate that there is a feeling on the part of some honourable members that the building of this line would sound the death-knell of the north-south line, or at least delay the building of it for many years. I disagree with that view, and remind honourable members who subscribe to it that we who favour this motion also support the building of the north-south line. We believe that the Commonwealth Government should honour its undertaking with the South Australian people; but even then this line will be necessary. As a matter of fact they are two entirely different propositions. The Northern Territory, in my opinion, will never be successfully developed by settlers who go to it direct from our capital cities. Before they can hope to succeed they must have some knowledge of the conditions that prevail there. I support this motion, for I believe that it will cause settlers of the right type to gravitate to the Northern Territory, and later to take up land in it . Many of the big holdings in the Territory that will revert to the Crown shortly will be subdivided for closer settlement, and it is highly necessary that there should be some setters with suitable experience, ready to take up the smaller holdings. It has been suggested also, by interjection, that the Queensland Government should bear the full cost of constructing this line. I disagree with that view. New South Wales will benefit at least as much as Queensland by the building, of the line, and should bear part of the cost of it . Another justification for building the line is that it will pass through country that is generally and rightly regarded as the stock uursery of Australia. Until comparatively recently there were 17,000,000 sheep in Queensland, but the calamitous drought that has prevailed in the last twelve months has caused 6,000,000 of them to die. The physical features of Queensland are such that it rarely happens that the whole State is drought-stricken at the same time. this line had been operating in the last twelve months it would have been possible to transport practically all the sheep that have died to areas where there was plenty of feed and water, and so to have saved them. The district that I represent, for instance, from Mackay to Thursday Island, is a smiling garden with an abundant water supply, and it would bave been of tremendous advantage to us if we could have transported those 6,000,000 sheep into some of the luxuriant country that is available there; but, as it is, the nation has suffered a loss the extent of which it is almost impossible to compute.",40
139,Mr MANNING ,"If only some of the 6,000,000 sheep had been transhipped the remainder would have had more country.",41
140,Dr NOTT ,"That is so. The best that could be done under existing conditions was to send away as many as possible of the stud ewes and rams. The wethers were left to their fate and practically all of them died. That will adversely affect the prosperity of Queensland for many years. Many pastoralists and graziers are experiencing the greatest difficulty in artificially feeding cattle and sheep. Some are expending as much as £2,000 per week in importing maize to keep alive the remnants of what were at one time magnificent herds and flocks. Were such a railway as is proposed in the motion constructed by the State and Commonwealth Governments in co-operation, the expenditure involved in its construction would be recouped in ' the first three months of any drought that might occur in the future. There is an economic aspect of the proposed railway construction in the effect it would have upon our beef industry - There are being grazed in the vicinity of the route of the proposed railway, half the cattle in Queensland, and Queensland produces half the cattle reared in Australia. Our surplus of cattle is roughly ""800,000. Twenty per cent, of the number are used for export under conditions that show no profit to the grower. About half the number are taken over the borders into the southern States, and used as store cattle, and for consumption in those States. The country through which the proposed line would go is the actual If breeding ground of most of these cattle, and if facilities were provided for their transport to the coastal areas, in times of emergency they could be treated in a satisfactory manner, and at a profit to the growers. Queensland is the only State that is still engaged in the beef export trade, and for the simple reason that she cannot get out of it . Costs of production and wages are high. The factories must be very large, for the reason that the killing and preserving of beef is a seasonal industry. Enormous numbers of cattle have to be passed through the meat works during a short season, and, consequently, wages in the industry are very high. Cattle having to travel long journeys on the hoof, must often be put through the factories in a condition which does not reflect credit on the output of the industry. Anomalous conditions existing at present in the southern portions of Australia might be, to a great extent, overcome by the construction of such a railway as the honourable member for Macquarie has proposed. As the average price which Queensland producers get for their beef at the slaughteryards or meat works is about 17s. per 100 lb. at the meat works, and 45s. for beef brought 9,000 miles, we can easily understand why there is no profit in the industry, and why Mr . Hardacre, who is now a memb<sr of the Land Court in Queensland, and was at one time Minister for Agriculture in a Labour ment, stated recently that if existing conditions continued the pastoral industry would shortly be a thing of the past. The' price of 17s. per 100 lb. of beef at the slaughteryards and meat works practically fixes the price of cattle for the whole of northern Queensland. producers in Queensland receive only 17s. per 100 l b . for their cattle, cattle are sold in the southern markets at the extraordinary price of 65s. per 100 lb. Only the other day I noticed the sale, in this, southern market, of a fourmonths o l d l f e if e r for £7, which is practically the price that would be paid f o i two cows in Queensland.",41
141,Mr FENTON ,Bullock s are sold here for £24 a head.,42
142,Dr NOTT ,"I noticed that at recent sales here 40 f at cows averaged £25 per head, whereas £4 10s. is a f a i r price in Queensland for a f at bullock. No one by any stretch of the imagination can suggest that one Victorian cow is worth four f at ' Queensland bullocks. Because of their inabilit y to get to the southern markets Queensland pastoralists suffering very severe losses.",42
143,Mr FORDE ,Thei r losses are not due to their having to pay high wages.,42
144,Dr NOTT ,"No ; but the fact that high wages have to be paid to men engaged in a seasonal occupation at the slaughter-yards and meat works contributes to the unsatisfactory condition of the beef industry. Queensland producers may not be envious of the price paid for beef in Victoria, but they are not satisfied with the conditions that exist in their own State. If a railway were constructed by the route suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie, it would link up the western portion of Queensland with the coast in such a way that a continuous supply of cattle would be available for the meat works. Townsville could then be made a slaughtering depot for the supply to southern consumers, not of frozen beef, but of chilled beef. This would greatly benefit the cattle industry of Australia, as well as consumers of beef in Victoria. tralia should have an enormous meat export trade, but those engaged in the pastoral industry have been up against the wall for a very considerable time. Various methods have been suggested to overcome their difficulties. An Advisory Meat Council was brought into being, Govern- but its establishment was followed by little or no success, though it was able to secure some concessions in freight ' and other charges. So long as the council continues in the effort to open up a foreign market in Great Britain and Europe, thebeef industry must remain Whilst in the pitiable position it is in today. The natural market for the Australian beef industry is first the Australian market, and subsequently the eastern market. We have not so far been very successful in reaching the eastern market, but persistence will eventually secure that market for Australian meat. If we carried out railway construction which would enable continuous supplies of cattle to be taken from the interior to the coast for fattening purposes, the enormous size of our slaughter-houses and meat works might be reduced, and with continuous operations throughout a lengthy season it should be possible to establish at Townsville a second Chicago. With scientific advice as to the best methods of freezing and chilling beef, there is no reason why we should not be able to capture the whole of the eastern trade. The are British market has been captured by the people of Argentina because they are in a position to slaughter their cattle continuously. The cattle are brought from the interior to the coastal areas, where they are fattened in alfalfa or lucerne paddocks, and can be slaughtered when in fine condition. Those engaged in the meat exporting industry in Argentina are able to chill their beef, whilst we are compelled to freeze ours. One of the ' subjects which could be taken up successfully by the' Council of Scientific and Industrial Research is the scientific freezing of beef - Fat cattle freeze better killed at one age than if killed at another age. Meat that freezes quickly is in better condition when thawed than meat that is frozen slowly. These are .all questions pertinent to the motion, and 1 hope that at no distant date the Commonwealth Government, in co-operation with the Queensland Government, wil l carry out a railway system which wil l enable a continuous supply of cattle to be available Aus- to our meat works.",42
145,Mr RODGERS ,"Whils t the honourable member's argument is sound as affecting the home market, it would not solve the difficulty with regard to the export market.",42
146,Dr NOTT ,"It would solve it in so far as a continuous supply of cattle to a centre like Townsville, where shipping is available, would lead to specialization in the beef industry on scientific principles, which should result in the production of a better article than is produced at the present time.",43
147,Mr RODGERS ,Our export margin is too small at present.,43
148,Dr NOTT ,"It is small, and it will , unfortunately, continue to smaller unless we can scientifically solve the question of freezing our beef in such a way that, to the discriminating palates of people in Europe, it will compare with the chilled meat obtained from Argentina or locally-killed beef. In my opinion the honourable member for Macquarie was wise in refraining from laying down a definite route in his motion for the railway construction he proposes. The route to be followed is a matter to be left to experts. When the bill for the north-south railway was under discussion in this House, a good deal of time was spent, and a great deal of heat engendered, during the debate because different members advocated the adoption of different routes, and endeavoured to support their views by the fact that half a point more or less of rain fell on the east or west of a particular route. The route of the line might very well be lef t to inquiry by the Public Works Committee, and local residents of particular areas could advance the special claims of those areas. I do not think the time has arrived when we should be warranted in adopting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan ( Mr Gregorv). The honourable member is, no doubt, anticipating what will in the future become an accomplished fact. He referred to the potentialities for agriculture and grazing of the country along the route that he has suggested for the construction of a railway. I am willing to agree with him as to the fertility of the region which he thinks ought to be opened up ; but up to the present it is practically virgin country, there are no large herds of cattle or flocks of sheep there, and settlement in the region is not far advanced.",43
149,Mr GREGORY ,In the Wave Hill district there is a considerable area of good cattle country.,43
150,Dr NOTT ,"But I understood the honourable member to say that although there was a great futur e for the district he proposed to serve by means of the railway he suggests, there are not very many herds there now. There is not the slightest doubt that that portion of Australia will ultimately be served by a railway, and I should be favourably disposed towards a proposal to build a road through it as a foundation upou which subsequently a railway could be laid. Personally, I think that a road built at a cost of about £2,000 a mile would adbecome mirably suit the requirements of the Northern Territory, but we are obliged to honour an obligation to build a railway, and, apparently, it - is the cjgsire of Parliament that such a line shall be built. A railway is evidently the solution of he problem of transport in the Northern Territory, but I suggest that the honourable member for Swan should withdraw his proposal for a railway, and substitute for it a proposal for the construction of a good road in that part of northern Australia he wishes to provide with transport facilities. I understand that it is the practice for many private motions to become hardy annuals, or almost perennials, but I hope that will not be the case with this motion. There are many reasons why the construction of a railway from Bourke to the Northern Territory is an urgent matter. When built, such a line will prove a great factor in the successful development of the fringes of Queensland and New South Wales, as well as the Northern Territory; it will afford enormous relief to the pastoralists and graziers along its route, and it will mean an enormous saving to Australia, through the prevention of losses from droughts. I hope, therefore, that the motion will not need to be put on the business-paper again, and that the Government will regard its adoption today as an instruction from Parliament that it should take the necessary steps to approach the States concerned in the construction of the railway. It gives me no little pleasure to support wholeheartedly the motion submitted by the honourable member for Macquarie.",43
151,Mr FORDE ,"Capricornia) [ 6 . 9 ] - I am pleased to give my support to the motion submitted by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) for the building of a railway from Bourke in New South Wales, through Central Queensland towards Cloncurry, and across the Barkly Tablelands, to a point on the North-South Railway in the Northern Territory. The pastoral areas between Bourke and Camooweal are among the best in Australia. The country through which the line would pass presents no engineering difficulties, and the railway should be a sound, economic, and commercial proposition. I think it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to take the initial steps towards having it built. It is difficul t to induce State Governments, with naturally . circumscribed views on such questions, to visualize a great project from an Australian perspective. Therefore, as the Federal Government took the first step towards the unification of the railway gauges of Australia, and as the first link from Kyogle to Brisbaneis being constructed the Government should also take into serious consideration the building of the railway proposed by the orable member for Macquarie. fortunately,- many motions standing in the names of private members are passed over and forgotten; but now that the Minister for Works and Railways ( Mr . Hill ) is in the chamber listening to what is said, possibly be will take up to the matter with the seriousness that it deserves. From a defence point of view, the railway would be of great importance to Australia.",43
152,Mr GREGORY ,Buildin g the railway as suggested in 'my amendment would bring about more settlement in the north.,44
153,Mr FORDE ,"The railway suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie would be a commercial and economic proposition. It would be a wonderful asset to Australia as a means of developing the continent. We all recognize that it is ""the duty of the Commonwealth to build the north-south railway, and Parliament has decided to build that line; but the proposal of the honourable member for Macquarie is an additional proposition which the Commonwealth should take in hand with intention to push it through to completion. It will be a long costing a great deal of money, but I think that the Commonwealth as a whole will be recouped its expenditure several times over in the first twenty years. is estimated that every four years in the area, to be served by this railway, the pastoralists lose, approximately 20,000,000 sheep. In a good season a sheep is worth from £ 1 to 27s. 6d., but at times the price paid in Queensland is as high as 30s. Taking 30s. as the value of a sheep, the loss of 20,000,000 sheep every four years means, approximately, a loss to Australia of £30,000,000. There are at present along the route within a reasonable distance of the proposed line, and in an area that would be benefited thereby, about 4,000,000 head of cattle and 10,000,000 sheep. During the recent drought in Central Queensland many large fortunes were lost owing to the difficulty experienced by the pastoralists in transferring their stock to areas in the southern portion of the State where there had been a good rainfall. Some of the pastoralists spent all their capital in feeding their stock on corn or any other fodder they could get. Some stock was transferred to the coastal areas, and hon- fed on sugar cane, and thousands of head Un- were railed from Longreach down to Rockhampton, and thence to Brisbane, and then on to Charieville, a distance of, approximately, 1,200 miles. If the railway proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie had been built, the stock could have been saved by a railway journey of 400 miles. If the line suggested is built it will presumably touch the main east and west Queenslaud lines at Dajarra, 500 miles fro m Townsville. on the Cloncurry line, at. Winton on the Townsville line, and at Blackall, 300 miles from Rockhampton, and Quilpie, 500 miles west of Brisbane. For the whole of the distance from Bourke to Daly Waters there is some of the finest country in Australia. It is necessary to build this line for national reasons. I have not the exact figures with me at the present time, but I think that Australia exports about 20 per cent, of its cattle; 80 per cent, are killed for local consumption. At any rate, it is estimated that Australia oan supply its own meat requirements until its population is increased by another every 2,0*00,000, and that afterwards there will be a shortage. It is stated in the line Commonwealth Year-Bool: that in 60 years our population will be approximately"" 20,000,000. It can be readily seen that, unless we build railways such It as that now proposed, to develop our pastoral areas, there must be a serious shortage of cattle to meet the local consumption in Australia. W it h in the next few years, great areas of rich pastoral leasehold lands in the centre, south, west, and north Queensland will revert to the Crown be cut up for closer settlement. ""Where there are today a few hundreds of considered pastoralists, in a few years there w i thousands of small graziers. The wealthy land to the Northern Territory. squatter with a big capital behind h can pass through a period of drought without being wiped out, but the small graziers with limited capital will in the same fortunate position. For instance, they will not be able to send their stock over the long, circuitous r a i l upon the journey between Longreach and CharleQueensland ville by way of Rockhampton and Brisbane; but, if the proposed railway is built, they can save their stock by transporting them over the much shorter route between Longreach and Charleville.",44
154,Mr MANNING ,"Eve n if the small settlers could bear the expense of the long railway journey referred to by the honourable member, there would not be sumcient rolling-stock available for them.",45
155,Mr FORDE ,"That is another point. In times of drought hundreds of people are calling out for rolling-stock. There are dozens of applications for special trains, and the result is that many of the pastoralists are subjected to' long delays. When sheep are in a very low condition, thousnds of them may perish before a train is available to remove them. This railway would bring Darwin into direct rai l communication with Sydney, from which it is distant about 2,241 and also with Canberra, the new Seat of Government. In the event of an invasion-whic h we hope will never happen-suc h a line would be of immense strategic value, and I believe that the Commonwealth would be justified in building it , if only for defence purposes. Royal 'commissions have reported upon proposals for - the construction of a railway along this route, but a good deal of opposition has been shown to it , because of a fear that it might prejudice the north-south railway, and the honourable member for Swan (Ma-. Gregory) has moved an amendment to the motion to provide for the construction of a line from Broome, or Derby, in an easterly direction to junction with the north-south railway at or near Newcastle Waters, and then south of east to Camooweal. That railway is entirely distinct from the proposal now before the House. ' A section of of the north-south railway has already and been authorized by this Parliament, and the Western Australian project must be apart from the proposed line l l be from Bourke through western QueensNone i m of these railways should be considered as competitive. It is the responsibility of this Parliament to develop the not be Northern Territory expeditiously and effectively. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, in a report north-south and Central railway proposals,-said:The Barkly Tableland comprises a stretch of rich country something in the shape of a rhomboid, extending in a south-westerly direction from a little east of Newcastle . Waters practically to the Queensland border, a distance of about 300 miles, by a width of about 150 miles, and containing an area of approximately 40,000 square miles. It consists of slightly undulating country, varying from 600 to 1,000 feet above sea level, and the rocks are almost wholly cambrian quartzites, sandstone, limestones, etc. The quartzites constituted the so-called deserts-generall y low rises, covered with sparse timber-and the black soil plains are covered with Mitchell grass. It has no permanent surface water of any consequence, with the exception of Anthony's lagoon, which has been known to be dry in particularly bad seasons, but has an annual average rainfall of between 15 and 20 inches, and large quantities of sub-artesian water can be obtained by boring practically anywhere. There are a number of stations on the tableland, and some 200,000 cattle are grazed there. At one period there were also 50,000 sheep at Avon Downs, but the breeding of sheep has lately been discontinued. miles, I have been informed that the Barkly Tableland is very suitable for the grazing of sheep; but, in order to put the wool-growing industry on a commercial basis, safeguard the graziers against drought, and provide communication with a portion of the coast, the railway is necessary. If it were constructed, settlers on the tableland would have direct and speedy access to the ports of Townsville and Rockhampton, and to Brisbane and Sydney. I am a firm believer in the past American and Canadian system of land development by the construction of railways in rich areas in advance of settlement. In those countries railways are regarded as pioneering agents, and are not expected to pay immediately. We .cannot expect people to invest large sums in the Northern Territory u n t i l railway communication is provided.",45
156,Mr RODGERS ,But I do not think we can expect any railways in that country to pay.,46
157,Mr FORDE ,"I could supply the honourable member with statistics to prove that railways are - Dot profitable in any new country, and, with few exceptions, are unprofitable the world over. better to supplement the earnings of railway systems from the revenue than, by the charging of exorbitant fares and freights, to place an unbearable burden upon the people in country districts. An y one travelling through Central Western Queensland at the present time must appreciate the urgent necessity for the construction of the proposed railway. When I was in Rockhampton a few weeks ago four and five sheep trains were passing through every night with stock being removed from drought-affected areas to southern pastures. with stout hearts and pectations have invested money in land and stock in Western Queensland, and some of them told me that they have suffered losses ranging from £5,000 to £20,000 during the last few months owing to the drought. Many of them have lost the savings of a life time. We must give adequate means of transport to the people who are prepared to pioneer this country. It is the duty of this Parliament to do anything possible to ameliorate the distress of the settlers of inland Australia and the Northern Territory. Honourable members have a responsibility to view this project, not from a State point of view, but as a great national concern, worthy of the intelligent consideration of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 p.m.",46
158,Mr DUNCAN,"HUGHES (Boothby) [S.0] - I have listened with interest to the debate on this there has been very little discussion of the amendment. The motion appears to me to be one of great importance, which will repay full consideration before a decision on' it is registered. shall not speak this evening at great length, but I hope to present a few facts in support of the claim which I have made. The suggestion was made by the honourable member for Herbert (Dr Not t ) that as honourable members from his State voted for the north-south line, honourable members from the southern States should reciprocate by voting for this motion. I do not wish to display ingratitude to any honourable member, whether he is a Queenslander or not for his attitude to the' north-south line; but I point out that the construction of that line will be It is simply the partial fulfilment of a contract entered into years ago, general and that no possible .claim can arise in regard to it . The responsibility for proceeding with the constructon of that line rested on the whole House, and I was glad to see that honourable members from Queensland recognized that fact just as did honourable members from other States. I should like to ask the honourable member for Herbert, as he recognizes the obligation resting upon this Parliament in regard to the that was line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, whether he agrees that the responsibility People is equally great to construct the line great ex- northwards from Alice Springs to Daly Waters. If he admits the one obligation, it seems to me that he is forced to concede the other.",46
159,Dr NOTT ,"I admitted that in agreeing to construct the north-south, line we were honouring an obligation.",46
160,Mr DUNCAN,"HUGHES - That is to say, so far as the line to Alice Springs is concerned, but what about the line not yet authorized from Alice Springs to Daly Waters ?",46
161,Dr NOTT ,I am willing to agree to the construction of that.,46
162,Mr DUNCAN,"HUGHES - Then I suggest to the honourable member that the proper thing for him to, do is to support the construction of that line before he votes for this motion, which refers to a line which is not a contractual responsibility of the Commonwealth. It has been stated by honourable members, including the honourable member motion- for Herbert, that it is futil e to suggest that the line proposed has anything to do with the north-south line. I must say plainly and briefly, that I cannot for one moment agree with that. I endorse the I interjections of the honourable member for NA - how any one can escape the point expressed in them. It is surely within the knowledge of every honourable member that for some years there has been much discussion as to the route which should be followed, and particularly as to whether the line should be constructed entirely - in South Australia and the Northern Territory, or should be diverted into New South ""Wales and Queensland, in which event it would pass through Camooweal, and proceed from there in a north-westerly direction to Darwin. is within the knowledge of every member of the community who takes an interest in these matters that there has been a division of opinion as to which is the best route. Residents in my State have always maintained that the direct route should be followed, because that is specified in the contract; but honourable bers from the eastern States have sometimes thought that the contract did not exist, and that the line should be diverted eastwards. I am sure that there is no one who will not agree that those two routes have been under consideration, and that the construction of neither of them has yet been completely approved. Therefore, I put it to honourable members that if this motion were carried, and were acted upon by the Government, the effect of it would be to renounce the contract, and to give effect to the alternative scheme.",46
163,Dr NOTT ,That is not the object of the motion.,47
164,Mr DUNCAN ,"HUGHES - I am not imputing an object or an improper motive to any one, but that will be the effect of carrying the motion if the Government considers that it should give effect to itThe motion is that a line be constructed from Bourke to Cloncurry, and from there, presumably via or close to Camooweal, to Dalv Waters. The inevitable result of that would be that for many years, and possibly for all time, the obligation to construct a line southwards from Daly Waters to Alice Springs would be shelved. For my part I have made my attitude clear right from the time when I entered this Parliament, and I repeat to-night that I will not be a party to any proposal which, in my opinion, will alter the route of the north-south line so as to remove it outside the central State. If the line from Bourke to Cloncurry, Camooweal, and Daly Waters is constructed, we may say that, almost as a matter of course, the proposed line from Daly Waters south to Alice Springs will be left unfinished for many first. years. I repeat that that line has to. be constructed under a definite contract, to which the Commonwealth Government has set its hand; but in regard to the line covered by the motion, the Government has accepted no responsibility, although I do not say that it may not have a moral responsibility in It such cases. The line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs is even yet only in course of survey. When I voted three years ago for the Emungalan to Daly Waters line, I anticipated that there would be a more vigorous prosecution of the enterprise than there appears to have been. The real point to which I memwish to address myself has not yet been referred to in this debate, and yet it is a point of some importance-the cost of the proposal. We may all agree that the proposal, on the face of it , seems to be desirable. If we take a map of Australia and notice where Bourke, Cloncurry, Camooweal and Daly Waters are, it is obvious that the line would develop undeveloped country, or at any rate, would provide modern. transport where it is needed, - I say that one should not embark on schemes of this kind for no other reason than that they appear to be desirable. I am the seventh member to speak in this debate. Of those who have spoken before me, four have come from Queensland. I do not suggest that those honourable members have not studied 'the question, at least in p r in t ; but has one of them, and if there is one of them, have two of them, seen this route? Have they been to Bourke and worked their way northwards via Cloncurry across the Barkly Tablelands to Daly Waters? It is very unlikely that any one of them has done that, and yet it is most important, befoTe we come to a decision on this question, that we should have information from persons, not necessarily experts, who have studied the question on the spot.",47
165,Dr NOTT ,"Is it not a fact that 6,000,000 sheep died there recently as a result of the drought?",47
166,Mr DUNCAN ,"HUGHE S - Many unfortunate things happen in this world which would be prevented if it were financially possible to prevent them. It is a question of the extent to which the country can afford to remedy them, and which of our troubles should be remedied We cannot say that because a proposal seems desirable on the face of it , or can be proved to be desirable, it must be at once accepted. Particularly is that so when dealing wrth a country of such enormous area of the country as that with which we are now concerned. I shall say very little on the question of cost, but what I have to say I hope will cause some honourable members to think seriously before they vote for what will be a heavy incubus on the Commonwealth. In 1923 we passed an act for the construction of the Emuugalan to Daly Waters line. was an extension of the existing line southwards for 160 miles, and it was to cost the Commonwealth a sum not exceeding £1,545,000 . In 1924 we authorized the construction of the Grafton to South Brisbane line, which was to cost the Commonwealth £3,500,000, plus discount, and the expenses of borrowing. Early in this year we passed the act for the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs line, which is to cost £1,700,000. circumstances, I feel perfectly justified in raising the question of the probable cost of giving effect to this new scheme.",47
167,Mr RODGERS ,Hav e the sponsors of the line given any particulars as to that?,48
168,Mr DUNCAN,HUGHES - Not my knowledge.,48
169,Mr MANNING ,"If this line had been in operation during the last twelve months the lives of 6,000,000 sheep could have been saved.",48
170,Mr DUNCAN,"HUGHES question is not what could have been saved, but whether from a business point of view there is sufficient capital available to expend on the project. A business man has to consider what undertakings shall be the first charge on his available capital, and I submit that that is the standpoint from which we should look at this proposal. The cost of the line from Emungalan to Daly Waters works out at nearly £10,000 a mile, possibly portions of the suggested line might be built for a little less than that. The honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr G. Erancis) stated that the distance from Bourke to Daly Waters is 1,230 In that event, this line would probably cost between £12,000,000 and £13,000,000, although it might be built for £10,000,000. If my figures are wrong I shall be glad to have them corrected. I submit that this House ought to give very careful consideration to any project which involves the country in such heavy expenditure, notwithstanding that the work might be most desirable from many points of view. In addition to the railway undertakings that I have enumerated as having been agreed to by this Parliament in the last four years, we must not forget that our railway gauges need u n if y in g : I shall not evade the fact that a large expenditure is necessary under that heading in my own State. It has been suggested that the £12,000,000 That necessary to build this railway might be appropriated from migration loans, but before that could be done, the States concerned would have to agree, and as New South Wales has not yet approved of the migration scheme, I do not see how it can be expected that this railway, at least in so far as New South Wales is concerned, can be built out of money derived from that source.",48
171,Mr MANNING ,Onl y 100 miles of the In these line would run through New South Wales.,48
172,Mr DUNCAN ,"HUGHE S - Apar t from the New South Wales portion, for a long distance it would run through the Northern Territory, and the question arises whether, in present circumstances, the Government would be justified to in spending immigration money in building that portion of it . W it h all due deference may I say that it appears to me that such a project should have been introduced, not by means of a private member's motion, but by The a responsible Government, and then only after the fullest and closest investigation had been made. This would be a very long railway, and as it would involve the country in enormous expense, it should have been left to the Government to consider the wisdom or otherwise of bringing the proposal before us. It is not a matter for surprise that honourable members who represent divisions in New South Wales and Queensland support the building of the suggested line from the eastern side, while honourable members who represent Western Australian divisions contend that it should be constructed from the western side. miles.",48
173,Mr MANNING ,Honourable members who represent New South Wales' and Queensland had sufficient vision to support the building of the north-south railway.,48
174,Mr DUNCAN ,"HUGHES - I do not desire to appear ungrateful for what has been done in that respect, but since the honourable member presses me, I may be permitted to point out that no division was taken on the proposal to build the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs line. I do not suppose for a moment that honourable members who represent New South Wales and Queensland would deliberately hinder the Government f u l filling both a legal and a moral obligation. But there is nothing of that kind to be considered in connection with this scheme, which is entirely different from either the north-south or the east-west railway projects. The building of the north-south line is a matter of contract between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments; and the eastwest line was laid, not only for defence purposes, but also to provide Western Australia with some internal means of communication with the rest of the Commonwealth; but this proposal is for a purely developmental railway. I agree that it would be within the power of the Commonwealth to undertake the work under the provisions of section 51 subsection xxxiv. of the Constitution, which provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this stitution, have power to make laws for peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to(xxxiv.) railway construction and extension in any State with the consent of State. But there is no reason for it having thing to do with the matter yet, for it not been approached by either of the States concerned. I regret that vernment will not give me permission to continue my remarks at a later date, for, strategic purposes. not only is there a good deal more that I should like to say, but I know that other honourable members who are absent today desire to discuss the question. the motion is to be forced to a vote to which night, as the Grafton to South proposal was forced to a vote some years ago, I shall vote against it and also amendment. A contract made by the Commonwealth Government South Australian Government yet been completed, and no suggestion has been made that the Government to introduce a bill in the near future a railway from Alice Springs to Daly Waters. What is more important is, that if the House should pass this Mr Duncan-Hughes. motion, and the Government gave effect to it , it is unlikely that the north-south r a i l w a y ' would be completed for very many years, if at all. In these circumstances, I have no alternative but to vote against both the motion and the amendment. NA tend to support the amendment. All schemes for constructing railways into undeveloped country should be subjected to the most eareful investigation. Reports submitted to us from time to time have recommended that, for strategical purposes, a railway line should be constructed right round the Commonwealth, but a considerable distance from the coast. The late E a r l Kitchener advised that that should be done. The proposal of the honourable member for Swan ( Mr . Gregory) is that a section of that belt of railway shall be constructed through one of the righest portions of tropical Australia, which has been known for more than 80 years. A f t e r Sir George Grey visited the Kimberleys, he strongly recommended the Government of the day to encourage settlement there. The land in that locality is unquestionably ferContile, and the only reason for its nonthe development is that it is not connected by railway with the settled parts of Australia. The honourable member for Boothby ( Mr Duncan-Hughes) sugthe gested that the adoption of this proposal would render most unlikely the comanypletion of the north-south railway; but has that is not in my mind. I consider that the State Governments should build their the Goown railway lines, except when special railways are needed in their territory for New South Wales and Queensland have constructed railways running inland from the coast. In Western Australia we have already three lateIf ral railways connected up, by means of settlers are enabled to go into the Brisbane back country. The railway suggested by the honourable member for Swan would the form a part of a necessary permanent railway round Australia. It would pass through excellent country from with the Broome or Derby to Newcastle Waters. has not It should quickly induce settlement, because that country is capable of carrying intends many sheep and cattle. It might be for connected with the line which Western Australia has constructed from Perth to to me Geraidton and away up to Meekathara.",48
175,Dr NOTT ,"Ha a the honourable member read Sir George Buchanan's report, and his reference to a proposed connection - with the Queensland central railway? NA port in connection with harbour improvement. The coastal portions of Australia are served by shipping facilities. The railway proposed by the honourable member for Swan is absolutely necessary in order to promote settlement on the rich and fertile country which it would open up. At Newcastle Waters the proposed line would connect with the north-south railway, and could then be continued through to Camooweal to link up with the Queensland railway system. I have no wish to question the reasonableness of the proposal of the honourable member for Macquarie, for the construction of a line that would be of service to the sometimes arid portions of New South Wales and Queensland; but we should have a concerted plan of railway construction, and if a line were constructed from Meekathara to Broome, thence across to Newcastle Waters and on to Camooweal, we should have a railway right round Australia. The construction of a railway at the same time strategic and developmental, ' such as that suggested by the honourable member for Swan, is deserving of the gravest consideration by this House.",50
176,Mr BOWDEN ,"Parramatta) [8.35]. - We can all agree that this is a very important motion, and that the railway construction suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) will be necessary at some time or other. No doubt a railway will yet be constructed from Cloncurry to Newcastle Waters, and thence right across the continent to Derby or Broome. Such a line would open up the most productive portions of the Northern Territory, and would do, perhaps, more than anything else that could be suggested to encourage its settlement and development. But I cannot lose sight of the fact that the Government has proposed the appointment of a commission to govern the Northern Territory. The two railways referred to in the motion and amendment are lines which should assist in the development of the Territory. Our first thought in considering them should be its development. We have had before us, from time to time, different schemes for railway construction. It has been suggested that a line should be built across the Barkly Tableland to the mouth of the MCArthur River. Another scheme prowould link that line up with the north-south railway at Newcastle Waters. But it seems to me that the House is not in a position, at the present time, either to affirm or to refuse to affirm the desirability of the proposed railway construction. If we did so, we should lay ourselves open to the charge of recklessly, and without due consideration, committing the Parliament to enormous expenditure. The cost of the railway construction proposed would not be thousands, or hundreds of thousands, but millions of pounds. That a proposal involving such an enormous expediture should be submitted to the House in this way, and that honourable members should be expected to vote upon it is not very complimentary to them. We need further inquiry and a great deal more information than we have concerning these proposals. In all fairness to the Northern Territory Commission should we not, before agreeing to such proposals, learn what its policy of development and its opinion with regard to railway construction may be? I agree with the honourable member for Macquarie that the railway he has suggested would be of immense advantage to the people of Australia. I go so far with him, but I cannot go any farther. We have very scanty information as to the cost of the proposed line. We have had estimates running from £10,000,000 up to £-10,000,000. We have no information as to the way in which the proposal is viewed by the State Governments concerned. We do not know whether they would or would not consent to it , or whether they would be prepared to bear part of the cost of the line within the boundaries of their States, or would expect the Commonwealth Government to bear the whole of the cost. We should have information on all these points before we are ask^d to vote for a proposal of this kind. These considerations prevent me from supporting the motion. The honourable member for Boothby ( Mr . Duncan-Hughes) has suggested that if the line proposed by the honourable member for Macquarie were undertaken, the north-south railway would be allowed to go by the board. I do not think so, because the construction of the railways proposed in the motion and amendment would not relieve this Parliament of its obligations in connection with the north-south railway. Sympathetic as I am with both proposals suggested, I could not possibly vote for ' them. I think that the honourable member for Macquarie should be satisfied with the expression of opinion given in the discussion of his motion, and would do well not to press it to a division.",50
177,Mr FOSTER ,"Wakefield) [ 8 . 4 0 ] agreew i th the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Bowden) in the view he has expressed of the impracticability of adopting the course suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr . Manning), and thus committing this House, as the passing of the motion would do, to a financial responsibility running into from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000, or more. What condition have we got into in this National Parliament when we talk of millions as if they were thousands? Five or six years ago such a proposal as the honourable member for Macquarie has submitted would never have been dreamed of in this Parliament. The honourable member does not know what the railway he proposes would cost. He has given us no information as to the route, nor has he told us the r a in f all 6r character of the country through which the line would go. Yet the honourable member would commit this House to the expenditure of all these millions of money. No wonder the taxpayers say that this Parliament has money to burn. It is not decent to put honourable members in such a position as they are placed in by being asked to vote for such a motion. They should realise their responsibilities to the country. So far as the development of the Northern Territory is concerned, we have passed a bill under which a commission is to be appointed to which that development is to be entrusted. The bill imposes great responsibilities upon the commission, in order that action may be taken on the spot, and things requiring to be done may be done promptly, and there may be a cessation of the wasteful expenditure of money to no purpose that has taken place in the Northern Territory since it was transferred to the Commonwealth. want honourable members to exercise a little common sense, and to have some regard for the position they occupy as representatives of the people. I should like a stop to be put to the hypocritical nonsense that is talked concerning the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament for the construction of the north-south railway and the development of the Northern Territory on the lines agreed to when it was taken over by the Commonwealth. If it is not developed in a practical fashion, honourable members need not continue - I their hypocrisy about maintaining a White Australia. Without development of the Territory, they cannot have a White Australia. We have no right to continue. to hold the Territory without using it . When we consider that there are millions of God's people close to our borders, who scarcely have room to turn, we cannot expect to keep Australia white if we do not make use of the couutry. The League of Nations has already intimated that we must be prepared to make use of the Territory under our control or tear down our barriers against coloured labour.",51
178,Mr FENTON ,The honourable member should not talk in that way.,51
179,Mr FOSTER ,The world will soon be talking in that way. The League of Nations has given an unmistakable note of warning to Australia.,51
180,Mr FENTON ,I think the honourable member had better leave that subject alone.,51
181,Mr FOSTER ,"I shall approach the question from another aspect. It is about time that this Parliament decided whether it is to attend to its own business, or build railways here, there, and everywhere. We have had before us during the last three or four years proposals unsupported by expert advice to embark upon projects involving the expenditure of millions of pounds; but fortunately, by vigorous and definite resistance in this House, we have been delivered from many financial responsibilities into which we would otherwise have been rushed. The history of railway construction in the States ought to teach us a lesson. Before plunging into the expenditure of money on building a network of railways that would be an incubus on the Commonwealth and keep taxation high, we should I endeavour to secure efficiency on the lines already controlled by the Commonwealth. In any case, we have no right to build railways .outside our own territory. It is the business of the States to do that. Nor can we build railways properly from Melbourne. Railway companies operating in other parts of the world never dream of undertaking the construction and control of railways which separated from their own particular systems. If a wise railway company intends to build a railway which is separated from its own system, it will arrange for another company whose system ad joins its new line to build and operate it , turning into a profitable concern what otherwise could not fail to be a losing proposition. we enter upon any project to build railways outside our own territory, we ought to have most efficient expert advice to tell us whether we are likely to do right or wrong. Political railways have been the curse of the Australian railway systems. In every State lines built by political influence have been abandoned, and in many cases pulled up. The honourable member for Macquarie proposes to build a line through pastoral country with a very limited rainfall. Railways never pay in pastoral country.",51
182,Dr NOTT ,Does the honourable member contend that the north-south line will pay ?,52
183,Mr FOSTER ,"I do not expect it to pay unless, in addition to pastoral country, it opens up mineral and other wealth. There are more unprofitable railways in Queensland than there are in any other State. The Queensland railways did not succeed in paying even before the calamitous reign of terror through which the State is now passing. I do not think I am far wrong in describing the administration of the Labour Government in Queensland as a reign of terror. This Parliament has put its signature to an agreement to build a railway from Oodnadatta to Darwin, but that agreement was made on the' understanding that even when the Territory was cut through from north to south by a railway its transport requirements would not be full y met. It was anticipated-, even before the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, that the building of the north-south railway would be but the beginning, and that the programme of railway development in the Northern Territor y would not be completed u n t il lines were built running east and west to the nearest ports in Queensland and Western Australia. The proposal of the honourable member for Macquarie is not new. Twenty years ago our old friend, Mr Waddell, brought forward a similar proposal. It was examined and dissected in every way, and if are it was a good proposition why was it not taken in hand by the wealthy State of New South Wales, or the State of Queensland, the wealthiest in the Commonwealth while it was under good management and was enjoying bounteous prosperity? It was not carried out because it would have brought no advantage to those States. Yet the honourable member for Macquarie is Before quite willing that the Commonwealth should accept the responsibility. It is about time the Commonwealth ceased doing so much work for the States. A thorough investigation of our financial position, which we have not had for many years, would show how impossible it is for us to embark upon these wild-goose proposals, which have nothing to recommend them. Honourable members should cease recommending the Commonwealth to embark on the expenditure of millions of pounds on projects which have not been reported on by experts.",52
184,Mr FORDE ,The building of this line would save millions of pounds' worth of cattle and sheep.,52
185,Mr FOSTER ,-How many - times would it do so?,52
186,Mr FORDE ,Every fou r years.,52

190,Mr COLEMAN ,"Reid) [ 9 . 0 ] - I take this opportunity to protest against delay of the Government in announcing its decision in regard to the subsidy for conditions, the mail and shipping services to the Pacific Islands. For many years past, Burns, Philp and Company has been paid by the Commonwealth asubsidy for in the maintenance of regular shipping and mail services to the mandated Territory of New Guinea, Papua, and January, other Pacific Islands, Australia trades. The inference be drawn from a departmental paper, dated the 16th March, and tabled in House a few weeks ago, is that the vernment intends to abandon the arknow, rangement with Burns, Philp and Comthat pany, and endeavour to substitute an arrangement with foreign shipping comon panies, possibly employing Chinamen, cars, and other coloured labour. If that is the intention of the Government, enter my emphatic protest against a step which is calculated to seriously injur Australian shipping and trade ancl throw out of work several hundred white seaTo men. In excusing the long delay that has taken place, in completing the arrangepany's ments for a new Pacific mail contract, the document to which I have already referred says - 1 It is, therefore, proposed to invite from companies trading - between Melbourne that have been made. on the one hand, and Singapore and Hong Kong on the other hand, to make regular calls at the principal ports of Papua and the dated Territory. Any service offered as a result of such an advertisement will be sidered as an alternative to the present vices, which make the Territories terminal ports. I interpret that statement to mean that the Government intends ,to offer to the Nippon Yusen Kaisha line, of Japan, and the E . and A . line of China, and other shipping lines a subsidy, to engage in the island trade. Such a policy will not find favour with the people of Australia, or the people who are SUBSIDYinterested in the development of Australian trade with Papua and New Guinea. The whole tenor of the published statement is that the present service is unsatisfactory. The existing mail NEWScontract, was investigated by the Navigation Commission when it visited Papua and New Guinea, and its report was tabled in this House twelve months ago. I am not so much concerned in defending Burns, Philp and Company as in the ensuring that an Australian company, employing white labour - upon Australian shall be continued in this trade; but that company has, undoubtedly, a legitimate grievance against the Government, because of its delay finalizing the contract. In September, 1924, tenders were invited for this service, returnable on the 15th 1925. Burns, P h i l p and with which Company wore, I understand, the only to tenderers, and the amount of their tender was subsequently published in the press. this How and why the information was disGoclosed, the Government professes not to but it was unfair to the company the amount of the tender should have been allowed to leak out. Again, the 8th October, 1925, the Governlasment called for tenders which closed on the 30th November last. Since that date, I nothing has been done by the Government, but Burns, P h i l p and Company e has been asked to carry on the service by temporary extensions of the contract. the complaint that the Pacific mail service has been unsatisfactory the comreply is that the delay of the Government in declaring its policy has precluded it from acquiring new ships to improve the service. If that is so, the Government's unbusinesslike methods offers are responsible for any complaints Apparently the purpose of the Government in deferring its decision is to induce other comManpanies to enter into this trade. The apconplication of the Navigation Act to New serGuinea and Papua was suspended last year, in face of the bitterest opposition from this side of the House, .but despite that inducement no foreign companies have attempted to enter this trade. Therefore, I suspect that the Government is offering to some foreign company special inducements to establish a service between Australia and the islands. The retention of an Australian-con trolled service is vital importance to the defence of tralia, and having regard to the fact that our Pacific possessions are costing the Commonwealth a . large every year for administration and ment the maintenance of shipping mail facilities, Australia is entitled to the major portion of the trade withthem. Although it may be advisable 'to develop the Eastern markets products of Papua and New Guinea, we must not lose sight of the fact that Australian service is necessary in order hold our share of the trade. At the pretion sent time the service maintained by Burns, Philp and Company means the expendithis ture in Australia upon repairs and stores of, approximately, £100,000 per annum, whilst the annual value of cargoes carried to and from the mainland is about £2.000,000. The wages paid, to tralian seamen represent £87,000 per annum. If , owing to the Government's failure to continue the subsidy for a defihave nite period, the company withdraws service, the Commonwealth will lose a substantia] sum of money that is now spent here, and many men will be thrown out of. work. Moreover, Burns, P h i and Company may be compelled by conditions competition and economic pressure to their ships with coloured labour, and dreds of white Australians will be thrown out of employment. It is for them. I am principally concerned because of the sent state of the labour market. I have received a protest from certain marine transport unions interested in the trade centralization I strongly deprecate. against any such action on the part of have the Government. They point out that addition to throwing hundreds of men that out of work the termination of the tract will mean a direct loss of £150,000 now expended in Australia each year for repairs to ships and other incidentals. There is no excuse for the Government's delaying of its decision for over twelve months. It has had ample time to arrive at a decision. It is not f a i r that Burns, Philp and Company should island be kept in suspense; and I hope that before the Government disconcargoes tinues the subsidy-if that is its intention-it will, give its supporters an export trade. opportunity to consider whether thac course will be wise, or fraught with aster and loss to Australia. The pany, which I approached unofficially for of confirmation of the information I have Ausgiven to the House, has, I understand, told the Government that it realizes that the present service can be improved. It sum is prepared to improve it if the Governwill be business-like, and indicate its and intentions in regard to the subsidy. surely Until the company knows what the Government proposes to do, it will not in cur additional expenditure in connection for the with the Pacific services.",53
191,Dr NOTT ,"Herbert) [ 9 . 1 3 ] - I am an very pleased . that the honourable member to for Reid ( Mr Coleman) has drawn attento the condition of the island shipping services. I have previously referred to matter in the House, and have been awaiting an announcement of the Government's intention in regard to the continuation or termination of the existing Ausagreement with Burns, Philp and Company. I have discussed the matter with the managers of the company, and they made it clear to me that the existing its uncertainty as to the Government's policy prevents them from instituting a thoroughly efficient service. The company is prepared to improve the service l p in any way desired, but under existing it is not prepared to incur the man expense of putting new ships into comhunmission.

All effort at I no animus against Burns, in Philp and Company. For 40 years company has pioneered the conEastern and Pacific trade, and, therefore, it is entitled to consideration commensurate with the services it has rendered. I should like the Government to increase the existing subsidy to such an extent as would offer an inducement to Burns, P h i l p and Company to make Townsville the terminal port for the services. AU the facilities needed for handling deep-sea ships, and large are already available at that port, which would be an excellent base for the If Townsville were made the terminal port for the island trade, disthe north of Queensland would be brought commore closely into contact with Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. Tliose possessions can be successfully veloped only by people who are accusBenjami tomed to tropical conditions, and the matic conditions of Nort h Queensland are almost identical with those in Papua New Guinea. I urge the Government bring this matter to finality at an date, so that the people of the islands may have an assurance of an efficient, shipping and mail service, without like the Postmaster-General which there is little likelihood of developwhether ment proceeding on the lines we desire. I am quite in accord with the remarks the honourable member for Reid ( M Coleman), and hope that at no distant date the Government will announce its intention.",54
192,Mr FENTON ,"Maribyrnong) [9.16]. - I wish to bring under the notice of honourable the Postmaster-General ( Mr action desired. Gibson) certain matters connected w i wireless broadcasting. There seems to be lows :a likelihood of the broadcasting business in this State being monopolized by one The Secretary, company. The Postmaster-General has already said that his department is alert in the matter and does not intend to Dear Sir, allow a broadcasting monopoly, but, notview withstanding that assurance, suspicious movements are afoot. I wish to place all my cards on the table, so that the Ltd., 3LO. Minister, in any investigation that he was may make, will have a knowledge of all the facts obtainable. Prom a man who Listener is well-known in the wireless world, and who seems to know the facts, I have republished ceived the following letter relating to the proposed sale, or swallowing up, of the 3AR Broadcasting Company",55
193,Mr GIBSON ,This matter is before the courts at the present time. I think there is a case arising out of the letter referred to by the honourable member.,55
194,Mr SPEAKER ,"If that is so, I hope the honourable member will not proceed to read the letter.",55
195,Mr FENTON ,"In the circumstances, . Farmer's I shall not do so. I shall deal, instead, with the refusal of certain broadcasting companies to supply certain journals to with copies of their programmes, for pub Mr. lication in advance. The honourable the Postmaster-General may know that the officers of his department have sent a communication to a company called Radio Journals Proprietary Limited depublishes a wireless magazine.

I should to say his department has power to prevent a broadcasting company from supof plying its programmes to one journal r . and denying them to others. In addition to the letter from Mr Benjamin, I have letters from Mr Malone. head of the wireless department of the Post Office, and Mr Brown, secretary of the department, who intimate to the company that the the department has no power to take the The letter from Mr . th Benjamin to the department is as f o l 5th October, 1025."" Postmaster-General's Department, Melbourne. In further reference to the writer's interwith Mr Malone, we enclose herewith copy of correspondence between ourselves and the Broadcasting Company of Australia Pty. You will notice that their last reply to us dated 3rd inst. 3LO is supplying all the daily papers two or three days ahead, the In , owned by the Herald and Weekly Times, a week ahead', and Wireless Weekly, in Sydney, also a week ahead with their broadcasting programmes. As our magazine, Popular Radio Weekly, has a large circulation, we see no reason why 3LO should not supply us with their programme also, it being of great interest to liateners-in who pay their licence-fee. We understand that a similar case was reported to you from Sydney, when you compelled the Broadcasting Company there to supply the programme. We are also given to understand that you have power under the act to compel the broadcasting companies to supply their programmes in advance. We also enclose copies of correspondence between ourselves and Fanner's, Sydney (2FC). supply the JAstener In with tlieir full week's programme a week ahead but refuse us any portion of it . To our mind, the reason for 3LO declining supply us with their prograimme is because Theodore Fink being chairman of directors of the Herald and Weekly Times publishing Co., is also a director of 3LO. The Listener In is owned by the Herald and Weekly Times Co., - and our paper, Popular Weekly, is in . opposition to them, although we enjoy a much larger circulation , which than their publication.

I hope that the Minister, if he has not power under the present regulations to prevent this preferential treatment of journals, will see that new regulations are introduced under which he can take action.",55
196,Mr SEABROOK ,"Franklin) [9.24] At Huonville, in my electorate, there is a very small post office, which was built over 40 years ago. The accommodation there for the staff is very cramped. A piece of ground was purchased by the department for the erection of a new office, the building of which I urge the Postmaster-General to expedite. The sent office is situated in a growment ing district, and its staff has to handle the mails of outlying parts. It was built at a time when residences were in cluded in post offices, and as a result greater part of the building is now used as a residence. I have another complaint to make about the post office at Sorell. Land was purchased for a new office there over twelve months ago. The residence which the post office was previously located was sold, and the office has been moved to another residence, where the only accommodation available for the transaction of postal business is a veranto dah, covered over the front with glass. The district should have an official office. The department ought not to expect its servants to work in conditions such exist at that office. When the department knew that the residence in which the post office was previously situated had been sold, it should have started the building of the proposed new office at once. Some time ago, I asked the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) a question relating to the Commonwealth Bank building at first Hobart. H is answer was that the matter had nothing to do with him, but conof cerned only the board of directors of the another station. [136] bank. When an honourable member ventilates such a grievance in this House, which is the only place where he can ventilate it , it is the duty of the Government to bring it before the directors of JOURNALS PTY. LTU., the bank. The bank building at Hobart is 70 years old. The Commonwealth bought it cheaply, but has spent a lot of money extending its scanty accommodation. The money that is being spent on this old building is virtually thrown away. A city like Hobart is entitled to a much better building for the accommodation of the Commonwealth Bank. The building is in the centre of the town, next to the post office, and arrangements could be made to conduct the bank business in the post office building during the erection of the new building. Many country towns have far better bank buildings than that which houses the Commonwealth Bank in Hobart, and I hope that the Government will very shortly erect a new building for it NA - I should like the Postmaster-General to preannounce the intention of the Governin regard to broadcasting wave lengths. At present many listeners-in in Sydney complain that it is impossible for - them to hear 3LO when 2 BL station is the operating, and Melbourne people complain that they cannot hear 2 BL when 3LO is operating. The wave lengths in Australia come within a narrow band and it is most difficult, unless one has an excellent receiving set, to listen-into the in desired station. I understand that the department takes the view that as listeners-in pay only one fee, they are entitled to listen-into only one station; but that unsatisfactory position will need be vastly improved before broadcasting can become as popular as it ought to be in a sparsely populated country of wide distances such as this is. I have been as informed that the number of wireless .broadcasting licences in New South Wales has decreased considerably in the last twelve months, and that is not as it should be. More licences have been issued in Victoria in proportion to its population than in any other State. It should be possible to provide wave lengths that could be selected on an ordinary set without difficulty. Even listeners-in who have class sets find it difficult, unless they are experts, to listen in to the programme their choice without interruptions from Mr . GIBSON - Selectivit y does hot depend upon the number of valves. NA but the position could be greatly i m proved. A few months ago a cohierence of wireless experts in Sydney decided to ask the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole matter of broadcasting in Australia. I should like the Postmaster-General to intimate the decision of the Government on that matter. Country newspaper proprietors in New South Wales, and I suppose in the other States also, feel that they have a grievance, because they are prohibited by certain wireless regulations from installing receiving sets in their offices. It often pens that news of public importance is known in country towns by means of wireless long before the country - newspaper offices receive it by telegraph or telephone. I understand that the department takes the view that if the newspaper offices were allowed to install receiving sets the telegraph and telephone revenue would suffer considerably; but I am afraid that we must face that loss. We might just as reasonably prohibit people from travelling by motor on the ground that it reduces the railway revenue, as prohibit newspaper proprietors from using the wireless on the ground that it reduces the telephone and telegraph revenue. W it h all due respect to the Postmaster-General f Mr Gibson), I say that it is folly to prevent our people from making the f u l lest possible use of wireless. I trust that the Postmaster-General will indicate the attitude of the Government on these matters.",56
197,Mr GIBSON ,"Corangamite - Postlaw master-General) [9.35] - The department is unableto meet the wishes of menced, the honourable member for Franklin ( Mr Seabrook) in regard to allow the ance post offices, where the business is carried on in private premises. many instances the department pays more for the service that is rendered than it receives through the offices. is to establish allowauce post offices throughout the length and breadth of country, so that the postal service people may be as efficient as possible. Honourable members who have travelled i Great Britain will bear me out when I say. that very few post office to be seen there, for practically the whole of the operations of the postal departnouncing ment are carried on in private business premises; but the people - have their mail delivered threeor four times a day even in the country districts. We have about 7,000 allowance post offices in the Commonwealth,' but it is most difficult to get people to maintain some of them. They tell us sometimes that the office consists of only a mailbag and a date stamp, and that they feel like throwing them out of the window. I am hopeful that, in the near future, it will be possible to provide automatic post offices in many country centres. In the meantime, an automatic post office is operating for Gippsland districts with hapgreat success. It is situated next to a school, the mistress of which had not time to sort the mail, and the people come along and collect their letters when they please. If that arrangement is generally adopted, the practice will be to sort mail matter in the post offices and deposit it in the boxes of people within the district by the mail contractor, so that they may collect it at any hour tbey like, on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, as well as on ordinary week days. I am also hopeful that it will be possible, in the near future, to establish an automatic telephone service in country districts. Two of our engineers have been working on a scheme for six months which they have high hopes will be completely successful. I cannot say any more on that point just now. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) expressed fears that there will be a monopoly of "" A "" class wireless stations. I understand that a case affecting "" A "" class stations is pending, if it has not been actually comso the least said on that question at present the better. But I can assure honourable member that there is no fear of a monopoly occurring, for the deI n partment not only controls the programmes that are broadcast, but also allocates the revenue, in accordance with It s policy the programmes presented.",57
198,Mr FENTON ,But is not a monopoly the - likely to occur when one broadcasting to the company can buy.out another?,57
199,Mr GIBSON ,"No monopoly need be n feared while the department controls the programmes, and allocates the revenue in buildings are accordance with them. I appreciate the desirableness of anwireless programmes as early as possible, and will go as far as I can to meet the wishes of the honourable member in that respect. Programmes should be available to the public at least a week in advance. Although many people may not desire to listen to racing and other sporting results, they may be very in terested in some other matter that is to be broadcast, so it is desirable to fix the time at which specific matter will be broadcast. It appears that the mantle qf Sir Austin Chapman has, in very truth , fallen upon the shoulders of .his successor NA already displayed that keen interest in postal matters which distinguished his predecessor, and now he"" is taking up the cudgels on behalf of listeners-in. matters he referred to are important, but difficult to deal with. The majority of the wireless sets manufactured in Great Britain and the United States of America are sufficiently selective to take twelve wave lengths between the limits of 2 BL and 3 AB , and then can cut out eleven of them, so that any one may be heard distinctly; but, unfortunately, many of those manufactured in Australia are not selective enough to separate 2 BL from the Melbourne station. During J u ly the ment will be inquiring into whole of the wireless regulations, and will make a close study of the wave lengths. The difficulty in disturbing the present arrangements is that it may compel a great many listeners-into purchase new receiving sets and alterations to broadcasting equipment. Only between 20 and 30 per cent, of the listeners-in in Australia use valve sets; so that a comparatively small number experience any disturbance. I assure the honourable member that the Government will give careful consideration - to the whole position. Broadcasting in Australia is not in the condition which the honourable member would suggest. It is probably in a more favourable position here than it is in any other country. The honourable member referred to a conference held in New South Wales. It was a conference of men associated with wireless, who had held a previous conference in Melbourne. opened the conference held in Melbourne, which represented the whole of the in terests of the wireless associations of Australia. The conference was instrumental in fixing certain conditions, including wave lengths round 1,000 metres, and was unanimous. When concluding the conference, I said that I was asr tonished that it should have come to that conclusion, and that the responsibility for it , if it were a failure, would be upon its shoulders. It was a failure. No one would accept the sealed sets, and receiving sets of the long wave lengths. Broadcasting has been in operation in Australia for something like two years, and the whole progress of the business has been, generally, satisfactory. The position with which we are confronted today is that every one is endeavouring to listen in , not only to stations in their own States, but to stations in other States. The There is no harm in that, and the Government does not object to it , but we say' that the licence issued to those 'having receiving sets is for listening into the stations in their own States. They try to listen in not merely to stations in their own States, but to those in other States, in Java, and in almost every country in the world. I agree with the honourable member that we cannot stand still in this business, but must march with the times. W it h regard to a broadcasting service for the country press, if we find that the depart- telegraph is obsolete, we must scrap the the telegraph, and must adopt more modern methods for the transmission of news. If we attempt that unlikely step, there is a difficulty in the way. The whole, of the news is copyright for 24 hours. News broadcast is copyrighted by the Age, Argus and Herald in Victoria for 24 hours, and cannot be used by the country press, except by arrangement with those ' newspapers. Broadcast news appears in the country press, but we are unable to say where it comes from . I can assure honourable members that we have made good progress in the new art of wireless, which has been so very successfully tried throughout Australia and throughout the world.",57
200,Mr MARR ,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [9.47] - I wish to reply to some I comments by the honourable members for Reid ( Mr Coleman) and Herbert (Dr No tt), as to the alleged dilatoriness of the Government in connection with the shipping service to the islands and the Mandated Territories. It has been contended that the Government intends to enter into contracts with companies employing Lascars, Chinese and other coloured seamen. The Government has no intention to do anything of the sort. It was stated that the Government had been permitting Burns, Philp and Company to carry on the service from month to month. The contract with that company expired on the 31st July, 1925. Prior to that the Government had called for fresh tenders for the carrying on of the service, but those received were not satisfactory. Burns, P h i l p and Company were then asked to continue to carry on the work for a further six months, which expired at the end of February last, when the Government again called for tenders. It has been admitted that the service ' is not satisfactorily carried out. That was reported by a committee of this Parliament, notwithstanding the fact that Burns P h i l p and Company have been carrying on the service for 30 or 40 years. The Government asked that company to carry on the work for a furthe r six mnoths, which expires on the 31st July next. We are told that the company is prepared to put on better ships if it is given a higher subsidy. The company has had a monopoly of the service for years, and has received a considerable amount in subsidies. claim that the people of Australia are entitled to a fair return for the moneypaid to the company carrying on this service, and as the honourable, members to whom I have referred have said, the people in the islands and in the Mandated Territories and Papua demand a better service than they are receiving at the present time. The Government have called tenders for the service with a desire to secure the best service possible. The honourable member for Beid said that the Government was approaching a Japanese company. As ,a matter of fact, it has approached no company, beyond asking Burns, Phil p and Company to continue to carry on the service temporarily. It has called for tenders two or three times in the press, and it is open to any company to send in a tender. It is merely camouflage to suggest that the service is likely to be withdrawn. I do not believe that Burns, Philp and Company can afford to withdraw fro m the island trade.",58
201,Mr FOSTER ,Its own business compel the company to carry it on. Mr Marr.,59
202,Mr MARR ,"I believe it will. Honourable members are aware that ships of all nations, no matter what the colour of their crews, carry our mails on the poundage basis. If we can give the Mandated Territories a better service in the carriage of mails and cargo we shall be in a position to give greater satisfaction to the League of Nations in our administration of those territories. Several proposals have been made in connection with the tariff for the islands, and the supply of a shipping service, and in this connection the operation of the Navigation Act has been discussed. I think that honourable members will admit that the Government is sincere in its desire to do what is best in the interests of the islands and the Mandated Territories. In calling for tenders for the shipping service to the islands, we have no desire to in any way injur e the Australian unions to which the honourable member for Reid referred. We have as much f a i th in our own people as the honourable member has, and are just as desirous as he is of providing work for our own people, not only in the running of ships to ths islands, but also in the making of necessary Tepairs to those ships. I can assure the honourable members who raised this question that the Government have given the matter a We great deal of consideration. In the very near future I hope to be able to make an announcement upon the whole matter, and I believe that the honourable members who have dealt with this matter, and honourable members generally, will be perfectly satisfied with the decision that will be arrived at.

This is a bill to appropriate from the Consolidated Revenue Fund an amount £1,000,000 for the defence equipment f u n d which was established in 1924 give effect to the naval ton policy, and an amount of £250,000 for air purposes. Honourable members will remember that in 1924 the defence policy of the country was consibly sidered and a definite programme agreed upon, to be completed in 1928-29. The money to be appropriated under this bill is required to fulfil in part the ments entered into at that time. defence of Australia is based on the nite principle that each dominion of the British Empire shall prepare its own home defence, and a second very imof portant principle that all expenditure carrying out a construction policy shall be paid out of revenue. The sum of have £1,000,000 is required to assist in meetemployment for our own people. ing the commitment of £7,000,000 for the construction policy entered into.",60
204,Mr CHARLTON ,"Whic h includes cruisers, and what else ?",60
205,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"It includes the cruisers and submarines for 1926-27. and £586,520 towards the cost of the plane carrier which is being built at ox Cockatoo Island dockyard. It is estimated tion. that the total cost of the construction the seaplane carrier will amount £1,300,000. I have said that an appromarket priation of £250,000 is required for a deprimary industries. fence fund for air purposes. Honourable members will recognize that since the HOWS E) fence policy was laid down in 1924 the whole idea of the air service necessary to co-operate with the sister defence services has altered. Every strategist now lays it down that the air service should be increased fivefold beyond what was considered necessary in 1924, and that no forward action by an army or navy should be begun without very careful reconnaissance. W it h the object of commencing this very necessary portion of our defence system, the work of building a seaplane carrier has been taken in hand. It is estimated that by the use of a seaplane carrier equipped with modern seagulls and amphibions, a radius of 400 to 500 miles is added to the range of any naval defence force. - I need not weary the House by going I into the details of every item of expenditure. It is recognized that an enormous advance has been made in recent years in air service, and the Government of has decided to commence building up this branch of its defence forces by to setting aside an additional amount of construc- £250,000 as a trust f u n d for the purpose.",60
206,Mr CHARLTON ,"Hunter) [ 1 0 . 1 ] - I recognize that - with the exception posof the £250,000 for the A i r Force, the money the House is asked to appropriate to-night is for work that has already been authorized by Parliament. It commitis, therefore, useless at this stage to The criticize the defence policy of the Godefivernment. But I may be pardoned for stating once more that the Labour party exceedingly regrets that about £500,000 the money the House is now asked to in appropriate is for naval construction abroad. It is money that could very well been spent in Australia in providing We have quite a. number of persons in every State who are unable to get work. the Among .them are artisans who are capable of doing the work of building cruisers. The policy of sending overseas to have work done for us will seanever make Australia self-contained, help to increase our populaWe cannot hope to absorb i m m iof grants unless we build up secondary in to dustries which will provide a local for those who are engaged in As the seaplane carrier is to be built at Cockatoo Island, dethe £500,000 we are asked to set aside towards the cost of its construction will be of considerable benefit to Australians. But it is hard to realise that it is the policy of an Australian Government to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 overseas for cruisers while at the same time it is having certain naval work done in its own dockyard. It is well known that we can build cruisers here just as well as they can be built in any other part of the world. Mr G. FBANCIS - Yes ; but at what cost?",60
207,Mr CHARLTON ,"The question of cost should not be taken too much into consideration. Wages are high in Australia, and we cannot expect to build vessels as cheaply as they can be built abroad. If the honourable member applied his policy to everything we use there would be no work done in Australia.",61
208,Mr G ,FRANCIS - I merely wanted to know at what cost the cruisers could be built in Australia.,61
209,Mr CHARLTON ,"The fact that it costs more to build the cruisers in Australia than abroad is no justification for having the work done abroad if we are anxious to advance Australia; and to say that the cost of this class of work in Australia should only equal the cost overseas in tantamount to saying that Australian workmen should be brought dowu to the level of workmen abroad. For the future advancement of Australia, we ought to keep our wages and working conditions on a very high plane. They ought to be better here than elsewhere. In other words, we ought to lead the world in such matters, but this we can do only by providing employment for our own people - The great majority of the citizens of Australia would not complain about having to find money to have work done in the Commonwealth if it would lead to their advancement. I question very much if it would not be a better proposition in the long run to pay more for building the ships in Australia than to have them built abroad. It would provide work not only for the men directly employed in constructing the vessels, but also for many others in handling the raw material, and for business people in supplying the requiremonts of the men directly employed on construction. The State would derive income tax from all who were engaged in the work of construction, and the Customs revenue derivable from the consumers at large would be considerably increased. A proper comparison cannot really be.instituted unless every aspect of the question is taken into consideration. I believe that, if that were done, the figures would show the advantage of having the work done in Australia. It is idle for us to talk about bringing immigrants here if we cannot find employment for our own people. However, as Parliament has already decided to have' these cruisers built in Great Britain . I have no desire to reopen a discussion upon the question. I think the Government is doing right in building up our air force. I regret the necessity for a defence system, but, as very little progress is being made towards disarmament, I think we should 'have an efficient air force. It will prove to be the most important branch of our defence system should it ever be necessary for us to defend our shores. The Labour party believes in air defence. Quite recently, when we were dealing with the defence policy of the Government, we were told in the press and on the public platfor m that the building up of an air force was not of very great moment so far as Australia was concerned, and that for our defence we must depend entirely on our naval forces. In order to show that there is some justification for the Labour party's adoption of the policy of having an adequate air force, I quote a few authorities on the subject. The late Admira l Sir Percy Scott said Australia's line of defence was obviously aeroplanes, submarines, and torpedo boats, against which no hostile fleet would dare approach within 200 miles. Lord Fisher, on the 30th October, 1919, in a letter to the"" Times, said It is as clear as daylight that the future of war on the sea absolutely precludes the use of any war vessel except submarines. . . . All we want is the present naval side of the Air Force. . . . Submarines would make Australia impregnable. Brigadier-General T. H . Dodds saysAustralia must have tanks, fast motor transport, anti-aircraft guns, and an enormous increase in aircraft. It is the opinion of Admir.al Kerr, of the British Navy, thatThe Australian line of defence is obviously comprised of aeroplanes, submarines, and torpedo boats.. Lieutenant - Commander Rawson claresI t needs little technical knowledge to see that Australia must concentrate on submarines, mine-layers, fast torpedo boats, and aircraft. Sixteen submarines can be built for the price of one battleship. Stanley Goble, Chief of the Australian A i r Staff, says The cost of equipment for air defence will be £3,000,000-les s than the cost of one battleship. No progress has been made towards a definite policy of air defence. Admiral Sims, of the ""United States Navy, saysHad any enemy submarines been present in April, 1915, the landing of troops on the Peninsula would have been impossible. In the Text Book of Militar y Aeronautics, two experts, Henry ""Woodhouse and Clem Hawley, sayOne of the principal uses of aircraft is prevent the landing of enemy forces by attacking the hostile ships and transports. An aerial service is one which can used in times of peace to carry messages, into. mails, or goods to the remote parts of the Commonwealth. Therefore it serves double purpose. Time will not permit me this evening to make a statement i regard to the defence policy of the Labour party, but the opinions I have just indicate that its policy of having an adequate A i r Force is supported by of standing, who declare that it is the best line of defence for Australia. But, while I support the establishment of an A i r Force, I regret the action of the vernment in building cruisers overseas. If it is the Government's policy to build cruisers in preference to aeroplanes, torpedoes, and submarines, the work of construction should be carried out in Ausseaplane tralia. We have here the men, the dockIsland, yard, and everything requisite for the building of cruisers, and the work should' be done in our own country, giving employment to our own people, assisting to populate the Commonwealth, and providing employment for the immigrants we may desire to bring here. But. it is idle to debate that issue now, because the House has already authorized the buildplane in "" of cruisers overseas. The only proposal it i the bil l before us is to estab- £500,000. lish an A i r Force, and as it is part of the Labour party's platform to have a n A i r Force in Australia, I can offer no objecde- tion to the bill. H ad the Labour party been returned to power at the last election, it would have taken steps to establish an A i r Force and to make Australia self-contained in regard to its defence by providing factories that could easily be converted in time of war to the manufacture of munitions.",61
210,Mr MANN ,"Perth) [10.12] - It is perfectly true that the general defence programme to extend over five years was submitted and tacitly approved by this House; but I think one is justified in expressing regret that we have had so little information in regard to the large expenditure authorized by this bill. It is not in accord with what we have been led to expect from the Minister for Defence (Sjr Neville Howse). When he has been submitting estimates of expenditure, he has, as a rule, given most to lucid, interesting, and full explanations.",62
211,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,This is not an estimate; it is merely an appropriation be to meet a commitment already entered,62
212,Mr MANN ,"It may be a commita ment, but I am at a loss to understand just how far it is a definite commitment. n If I remember rightly, when"" the five year's programme was agreed to the Goquoted vernment made the announcement that it would build a seaplane carrier in Ausmen tralia at a cost which was estimated to be about £800,000. The Minister will doubtless correct me if I am wrong.",62
213,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"There was a tenGotative suggestion at that time that it would cost not less than £835,000.",62
214,Mr MANN ,"The general impression honourable members formed was that £800,000 would be about the cost of the carrier to be built at Cockatoo but the Minister, in introducing this bill to-night, has told us, in a some-' what cursory manner, that it includes an amount of £586,000 for a seaplane carrier, the total cost of which is now estimated to be £1,300,000. I ask the Minister if that is correct?",62
215,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,It is.,62
216,Mr MANN ,"T n other words, the seacarrier which was estimated to cost new £800,000 is now likely to cost another Such a huge advance upon the original estimate calls for some explanation by the Minister -»",62
217,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"It was not a definite estimate. Mr MANN "" - It may not have been, but the House and the public were led to believe that the seaplane carrier would cost about £835,000. Now we are told that the cost will be £500,000 moreMONICA",62
218,Mr WEST ,A million pounds is not much.,63
219,Mr MANN ,"Apparentl y the Commonwealth is becoming so accustomed to playing the part of a Croesus that it is prepared to throw millions of pounds about here, there, and everywhere.",63
220,Mr CHARLTON ,"I consider that an increase of half a million pounds on the original estimate is serious, and the House should be furnished with an explanation of it . I did not hear the figures when the Minister was speaking.",63
221,Mr MANN ,"I submit that the Minister should explain how the increased cost has been arrived at. Have competitive tendei's been invited, or reliable comparative estimates prepared by which the amount can be checked? I am not opposed to a progressive defence policy, but the House is entitled to more detailed information than the Minister furnished. Is £1,250,000 such an insignificant amount that we can pass it in a few minutes without any explanation? venture to say that honourable members are shocked at being asked to expend upon a seaplane carrier £500,000 more than was originally estimated. Some honourable members opposite seem not to mind how much things cost so long as the money is spent in Australia. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the proposed development of the air service is most advisable, but the country should have some assurance that it is receiving value for its money. must exist in the department large resources of information upon which the Minister could have drawn for the enlightenment of the House. ferred to certain aeroplanes by name; he might have told us more of what is intended to be done with this money, so that we should be qualified to record an intelligent vote upon the bill.",63
222,Mr MAHONY ,"Dalley) [10.20] - The Minister for Defence failed to give to the House adequate information concerning the proposed expenditure. For instance, he might have told us of the progress the construction of the cruisers overseas. When these vessels were under discussion in the House in 1925, the Prime Ministion ter, in combating the contention of myself and other honourable members on this side of the House, that they should be built in Australia, said that time was of the essence of the contract, and that, if the vessels were built in the Commonwealth, they could not be delivered with in the contract period. Will the Minister tell us whether the successful tenderer, John Brown and Company, is proceeding with the work up to schedule time, and whether the vessels will be delivered on the due date ? I am in possession of certain information on this subject, which suggests that the time condition of the contract is not now considered so important as the Prime Minister declared it to be; but I shall refrain fro m disclosing what I have been told u n t i l the Minister has had an opportunity to give to the House further details. John Brown and Company obtained from the Commonwealth Government a contract which will cost the taxpayers of Australia over £4,000,000. W it h that money work is being provided for people thousands of miles away, while our own artisans are hopelessly looking for employment. How is the contract progressing ? The committee is entitled to I knoAv also what payments have been made to John Brown and Company. If we vote this money without any further explanation, we are not guarding the finances of the country so jealously as the Treasurer urged us to do .before he became a M in ister of the Crown. I remember him speaking of ""switching on the l i g h t "" and compelling certain persons to "" drop the loot."" It would be well if the honourable gentleman were as enthusiastic and energetic an advocate of economy as he There was when merely a private member. I remember the anxiety of ministerialists to examine the closest details of Australian tenders in order to ascertain whether, if He re- the contract were let locally, the cruisers could - be delivered within the specified time, and at the contract price. I would like those gentlemen to be equally curious about John Brown and Company's performance of its contracts. Has that firm done sufficient work to entitle it to the money it has already received from the Government ?",63

We all recognize the important strides that aviahas made during the last few months. r and we have every reason to be proud of the work being done by Australian experimenters.

The engineers should given every encouragement and astry. sistanceto continue the magnificent work in which they are At present they are hampered in their experiments in a way that is not in the interests of the country. saw the Wackett machine make its not first flight, and it was certainly a thrilline spectacle. I know that official flights have been made since. To man, the machine is a masterpiece of workmanship, and its performances have been as good as its appearance. Mr E. EILEY (South Sydney) [10.32] - The honourable member for Perth ( Mr Mann) has complained about the honourable the Minister not giving full information to this House about the seawill plane carrier. It is possible that the naval authorities have altered of the ship. That is generally done when naval works are being carried out. If complete drawings are not ready when the work is started, or if the plans 'are altered afterwards, the cost is increased. My information is that the Navy Deprivilege partment is not giving the builders reasonable chance to construct the plane carrier cheaply. The department has not made up its mind about many of the details. I know that the Royal Navy does the same kind of thing. HMAS. Adelaide when completed at Cockatoo was almost a different ship from H . M . A . S . Adelaide as designed.",63
224,Dr EARLE PAGE ,"How many times, was she obsolete before she was finished? [137] Mr E . RILEY - In other countries naval vessels often become obsolete while they are being built. It . is a mistake to spend large sums of money on",64

RILEY - It is too late to do I would vote at any time to stop the building of warships, and to spend the I money instead on merchant ships that could render service to the community. I hate to think that we are spending so much money on warships. . The two cruisers that are being built in the Old Country will be obsolete in four or five but years. In that matter the Government would not take the advice of members of of the Opposition and spend the money on aeroplanes and submarines, which will be comprise the future defence of this counI hope that the dockyard will not be blamed for the extra cost of the seaengaged. plane carrier u n t i l it is known whether the plans were complete when the work was started, and whether they have been I altered since; and that the public will attribute the increased cost to the. very workmen. The workmen of this country can build ships as cheaply, having rea laygard to their wages, as the workmen of any other country. Men in the shipyards here do more work per man than the men in the shipyards of other countries. I do not know whether that is because they are better fed and better housed, or because they work in a better climate; but the fact is that in almost everyindustry the Australian workman is superior. I hope that the Minister be able to give a' satisfactory explanation of the increase in the cost of the design the seaplane carrier.",64
226,Mr RODGERS ,"Wannon) [10.36] The honourable member for Perth ( Mr. Mann) has stated my view of this matter. Honourable members have not had the of hearing from the honourable a the Minister for Defence ( Sir - Neville seaHowse) an outline of the general defence system of the nation. I know that great confidence is felt throughout Australia in the Minister, and it would certainly be a stimulus to the people were he to make a broad statement on the subject of defence. A high military authority in this country, Sir John Monash, recently made some pointed remarks about the shortcomings of Australia's defence provisions.",64
227,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,In his last speech he praised our defence.,65
228,Mr RODGERS ,"And he spoke of shortcomings, too. He criticized, not the honourable the Minister, but the nation as a whole. I thought the Minister would have taken this opportunity to give an outline of the steps that are being taken to make the arms of defence effective. It will come as a great surprise to the people to know that in this new venture of building a seaplane carrier the departmental estimate has been ex. ceeded by 63 per cent. That is a very substantial increase, and I hope that there is more warrant for it than we have heard to-night. I believe that, so far as possible, the nation's work should be done in Australia. This nation can be made great only from within, and I hope that the wide gulf that now exists between costs here and elsewhere will be overcome by an overhaul of our internal economic conditions. We should not. if we can help it, farm out the nation's work. I have the most sincere confidence in the honourable the Minister, and I hope that he will take an early opportunity to give a reasonably complete sketch of the forward steps that are being taken to defend this nation. It across the cables the other day . that in the councils of the world Labour Congress great exception was being taken to the White Australia policy. have already said in this House that if we are ever challenged on this matter, we shall not be supported by many nations from whom, in the past, we have expected support. Of the 400,000,000 subjects of the British Empire, not more than 65,000,000 are white persons; the rest belong to coloured races. If we are challenged on such a question there may be something in the nature of a general upheaval. We cannot expect very much assistance from our kinsmen in the United States of America, where they are faced with a problem which we wish to avoid. This is the most important subject with which an Australian Parliament can deal, and, consequently, demands full consideration and a definite assurance that everything is being done in the interests of the nation.",65
229,Mr WEST ,"East Sydney) [10.41] understand that the object of the . sure is to olace £1,250,000 into fund to meet payments on certain defence works. 1 should be more pleased if the expenditure was to be incurred in constructing homes for the people, instead of on machines for blowing out other peoples' brains. If the Government wishes the air service to be properly developed, further .consideration should be given to a suggestion already made that the machines now under the control of the Defence Department be used by the Postal Department for the carriage of mails and passengers. They could be in charge of A ir Force officers, who would then have an opportunity of being efficiently trained. There are at present two companies carrying mails and passengers, but the passenger rates are so heavy that the service is of no benefit to the community.",65
230,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"Calare-Min ister for Defence and Health [10.45] The honourable member for Perth ( Mr. Mann), and the honourable member who followed him, are evidently under the impression that this is the occasion on which some definite announcement should be made concerning the defence policy of the Government.

232,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"Commit ments have already been entered into. The sum of £1,000,000 is to be spent on naval construction, and the expenditure has already been agreed to by the House. The £250,000 is something additional.",65

234,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"In 192S. In reply to the question of the honourable member for Dalley ( Mr Mahony), I may explain that according to the information received from London there will be no delay in the completion of the cruisTS.

The seaplane carrier is to - I cost £1,300,000. The tentative estimate meawas £850,000, but certain modifications a trust have increased the amount.",65
235,Mr MANN ,Is that due to alteration in the plans?,66
236,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"Partly , and to the extra cost of material. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) . pointed out, there can be no question as to the value to Australia of an adequate air force, and I only wish that the amount we propose spending were £1,000,000 instead of £250,000. If the larger amount were available during the next two or three years, the air for.ee could effectively co-operate with the. sister services. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Appropriation of £1,000,000 for naval construction)MONICA",66
237,Mr MANN ,"Perth) [10.49] - I merely wish to say a few words concerning the Minister's explanation of the manner in which the money is to be spent. My protest was not against the policy of the Government; for I said most distinctly that I favoured a progressive defence policy. The Minister apparently misunderstood my remarks, for I did not suggest that this occasion was appropriate for the Government to announce its defence policy. The policy, as a matter of fact, has been announced, and has been approved by Parliament, although some new members have been elected since it was agreed to. But surely, even though the general lines of the policy have been agreed upon, the Minister has not been relieved of the duty of explaining the items which make up the total of an appropriation bill of this character. It is quite likely that modifications and alterations may be made in the policy, in regard to which honourable members should be enlightened. The Minister has admitted that greater expenditure is being incurred now in regard to air defence. I think we are entitled to a progress report on matters of that kind, and also to some information on the general trend of defence affairs. I asked the Miniater, I think in a co-UTteons way; to give us an explanation of how this money was being expended, but we were given one only after considerable pressure had heen applied. I submit that that is not treating honourable members courteously. It is customary to include a schedule in bills of this character setting out .details of the expenditure. I am sure that we all have the greatest confidence in the Minister, but, nevertheless, he should accede to reasonable requests for explanations in matters of this character.",66
238,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE ,"Calare-Min ister for Defence and Health) [10.54] I thought I had made it perfectly clear that this money was necessary tb meet definite commitments in regard to the two 10,000-ton cruisers and two submarines and one seaplane carrier that the Government is having built. I repeat that this LS not the appropriate time to explain in detail the progress that is being made in carrying out our £7,000,000 defence constructional policy. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to.

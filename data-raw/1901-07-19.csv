NA,"e a l l recognise, Mr Speaker, t h a t there",15
NA,Commonare three things which live to-day. One,15
NA,the unfortunately is this---tha t the master-key,15
NA,this soidid age is practical u t i l i t y . The t w o,15
NA,"a r e - j o y f u l l y so I t h i n k - f i r s t , t b a t",15
NA,essence of democracy is equality of sacri-,15
NA,"fice, and secondly, thab the spirit of demo-",15
NA,"cracy is equality of opportunity to a l l . N o w ,",15
NA,a recognising t h a t honorable members are n ot,15
NA,n as good a position as I am to-day i n,15
NA,having the first opportunity of t a l k i n g,15
NA,"to the House, I shall limit my speech",16
NA,"to the shortest possible time, in order",16
NA,to give others a chance. I shall thus,16
NA,"conform with, the spirit of democracy.",16
NA,No one is more conscious than I am of tlie,16
NA,"prophetic fact that, as the Commonwealth",16
NA,"grows older, new issues will be evolved of",16
NA,"time, progress, and experience, and old issues",16
NA,perish j but the great fundamental principles,16
NA,of democracy commended and sanctified by,16
NA,the voice of the united Australian people,16
NA,"remain, and will ever remain as the only in-",16
NA,destructible security for the perpetuation of,16
NA,free and responsible Government. The safe-,16
NA,"guarding of individual rights, the reserved",16
NA,"rights of the States, the equality of all His",16
NA,"Majesty's subjects before the law, and the",16
NA,supremacy of tlie Commonwealth within,16
NA,the; specified bounds of the Constitution,16
NA,must form the legitimate foundation of,16
NA,"human freedom, human justice, and human",16
NA,"rights in this southern empire. Not only so,",16
NA,but the surrender of any of these rights,16
NA,will for ever destroy that parity of rights,16
NA,and powers which will enable this southern,16
NA,"empire to develop i n peace and harmony, and",16
NA,to be sustained by means of our own local,16
NA,self-government. Every nation has its,16
NA,"peculiar trait, genius, type, or characteristic,",16
NA,and this is absolutely unchangeable. I t,16
NA,also has its particular mission to f u l f i l,16
NA,"in the economy of tbe world, certain",16
NA,"fundamental truths to reveal, certain",16
NA,fundamental thoughts to unfold and,16
NA,develop. The great Commonwealth has,16
NA,now before ifc a supreme specified duty to,16
NA,perform in the erection of the federal,16
NA,capital upon ground held in the fee-simple,16
NA,of tbe nation; property that shall belong to,16
NA,"the whole people, and not to a few comatose",16
NA,"monopolists. The federal capital, or the",16
NA,home of the people of the Commonwealth,16
NA,should be built in harmony with the,16
NA,"artistic spirit of progressive civilization,",16
NA,and not in accordance with the ideas of,16
NA,inartistic vulgar savagery. When we look,16
NA,"about and see the modern cities of the world,",16
NA,surely we must come to the conclusion that,16
NA,"the designers or the builders could not have,",16
NA,been far removed from barbarism. I am glad,16
NA,that my bat enables me not to continuously,16
NA,gaze on these inartistic structures. I believe,16
NA,in devoting my attention to the artistic,16
NA,structures designed by the Divine Architect.,16
NA,We all admit that we want to see this,16
NA,federal capital a success; we want to see,16
NA,u great commercial and industrial beehive,16
NA,of humanity grow up in a new portion of,16
NA,Mr O'Malley.,16
NA,"Australia, a home of the people of Australia..",16
NA,The Constitution says i n section 125 that,16
NA,the federal territory shall not be less,16
NA,than 100 square miles i n extent. One-,16
NA,hundred square miles is 10 miles square..,16
NA,W i l l this new city be erected in the centre,16
NA,"of the 10 miles square? Supposing i t is,,",16
NA,the very moment that we lay tlie first stone-,16
NA,"there will be a syndicate, and, naturally so,",16
NA,that will start and buy tlie land outside the,16
NA,town site. We all realize that the,16
NA,Britisher is most anxious to own tlie free-,16
NA,hold of his property. The syndicate will,16
NA,"say- "" You can come here and have the-",16
NA,freebold on payment of a small sum,16
NA,"in advance."" A tramway .will be built",16
NA,"from the Post-office, and what will be-",16
NA,the result? Tlie city will be on free-,16
NA,"hold, and the Government will expend the-",16
NA,people's money onbuilding Government-,16
NA,"buildings, and we will just have our own",16
NA,political residences there. Every dollar-,16
NA,spent by the people of Australia in 'the,16
NA,erection of that capital will create an un-,16
NA,"earned increment in the property for miles,",16
NA,"and miles around, because i t will create-",16
NA,a new market for tlie people. The question,16
NA,"now is, are the people of Australia prepared,",16
NA,"to spend thousands and thousands, yea,",16
NA,"millions, ancl then lose fche benefit of the-",16
NA,product of their own expenditure ? That,16
NA,"is the question that honorable members have-,",16
NA,to ask themselves to-day. Take the ease off,16
NA,Melbourne. When Melbourne was laid out,16
NA,i t was never intended that Flinders-lane-,16
NA,should have the great warehouses of the-,16
NA,"city, but high prices were charged for the-",16
NA,"property in the big streets, and low prices-,",16
NA,"for the property in the side streets, and.",16
NA,the strong merchants went to the side,16
NA,streets and made them the main sfcreets-,16
NA,Now that is precisely what is going to-,16
NA,ll appen if we limit the area of the federal-,16
NA,capital site to 10 miles square. Take the-,16
NA,case of Washington. That city has an.,16
NA,"area of 10 miles square, and has ""towns on",16
NA,all sides of i t which contribute not one dollar-,16
NA,"towards keeping ifc in repair, although they",16
NA,derive all the advantages attached to the-,16
NA,expendifcure of the people's money. Some-,16
NA,honorable members may think that 3-°> miles-,16
NA,"square is a large area, but we have bull",16
NA,"runs in Texas of greater area than that, and'",16
NA,wheat fields of similar extent in Dakota.,16
NA,Now another point to which I ; would like-,16
NA,"to direct attention is, that we want to-",16
NA,"have the waterworks of the federal capital,",16
NA,within tbe Commonwealth area. We cannot,16
NA,attain this object if we have an area of,17
NA,only 10 miles square. We want to make,17
NA,sure tbat i f an enemy invades the Common-,17
NA,"wealth, we shall have our waterworks so",17
NA,situated that we cannot be cut off as,17
NA,Santiago was when attacked by tlie,17
NA,Americans. What is the first thing that the,17
NA,"enemy goes for when he attacks a town? Why,",17
NA,the waterworks. That was what happened,17
NA,at Johannesburg when Jameson made his,17
NA,raid. The Boers had the waterworks and,17
NA,ifc was all up a tree with Jameson's friends.,17
NA,Some honorable members will say that we,17
NA,could not get such a large area of land,17
NA,as I have indicated; but if the honor-,17
NA,"able member, for Eden-Monaro is right he",17
NA,has a spot picked out i n his electorate as,17
NA,a site for the capital which cannot be,17
NA,"surpassed."" Of course in fche event of that",17
NA,site being selected we should lose the services,17
NA,"of the honorable member in this House,",17
NA,because no man could represent tbe federal,17
NA,area. The honorable member tells me that,17
NA,we could get all tbe land we require in,17
NA,Monaro without the slightest difficulty. We,17
NA,shall have to build railways to tbe federal,17
NA,"city at considerable expenditure, and we",17
NA,should take up a sufficient amount of land,17
NA,to .make i t impossible for othersfcowork up,17
NA,a big land boom on our borders.,17
NA,lately I have been speaking to some clever,17
NA,up-to-date men. Of course there are some,17
NA,"clever up-to-date men i n this House, but",17
NA,"I mean money-makers, and politicians do",17
NA,not generally make money. These gentle-,17
NA,"men tell me, and there is no doubt about",17
NA,"ifc, tbat the very first opening afforded in",17
NA,"connexion with tbe federal site, wherever i t",17
NA,"may be, will ""be taken advantage of to work",17
NA,"up an immense land boom on the borders, i f",17
NA,the site is only a few miles square. I,17
NA,want to make ifc impossible to have such,17
NA,"a land boom, and tlie only way in which we",17
NA,can do that is by starting on the right,17
NA,lines'. We must remember that i n this,17
NA,matter we are not acting for ourselves,17
NA,"alone, but for countless „ millions of un-",17
NA,"begotten generations of future ages. Now,",17
NA,the question is whether tbe Common-,17
NA,wealth Government are equal to the great,17
NA,"task before them. I think they are, or I",17
NA,would not be sitting here. As soon as I,17
NA,lose confidence in the Government I shall,17
NA,sit on fche other side of the House.,17
NA,think the Government are equal to tlie,17
NA,"task, but they want this House to spur",17
NA,them on. L have had a lot of experience of,17
NA,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, and I",17
NA,know that the harder we fight him tlie,17
NA,better he goes. When the federal city ia,17
NA,started we shall have to lay out thousands,17
NA,"of acres i n botanical parks, zoological gar-",17
NA,"dens, and boulevards, and we shall have",17
NA,"to build a Government House, and create",17
NA,artificial lakes. The honorable member for,17
NA,"Eden-Monaro says, however, that we shall",17
NA,"not require artificial lakes, because the",17
NA,Snowy River is up in his countiy. I f,17
NA,we wish to make a failure of the federal,17
NA,city we shall confine ourselves strictly,17
NA,to an area of 10 miles square. I,17
NA,think the people of New South Wales owe,17
NA,an eternal debt of gratitude to the right,17
NA,"honorable member for East Sydney, Mr.",17
NA,"Reid, for getting the capital located",17
NA,"within that State, and, on the other hand,",17
NA,I think that we owe him an eternal debt of,17
NA,"ingratitude, because he has limited our area",17
NA,of selection. I know plenty of spots in Tas-,17
NA,mania that would make splendid sites for a,17
NA,federal capital. I do not desire to take up,17
NA,"the time of the House any further, but I sayp.",17
NA,that fche unearned increment created by thef j,17
NA,expenditure of the people's money belongs t q -,17
NA,"the people, and that the vesting of the land '",17
NA,"in fee simple in the people is an inalienablej ,",17
NA,right. The building of this capital is a vital ',17
NA,Only question and of great importance to hu- '',17
NA,"inanity, and i t is for the Federal Govern- | ;",17
NA,ment to crystallize tlie whole tiling into a \,17
NA,living tangible reality for the benefit of the I,17
NA,people. Even the most ordinary people *,17
NA,admit that the federal capital will be fche,17
NA,"political centre offcheCommonwealth, but I",17
NA,claim that i t will also be the precise terri-,17
NA,torial centre of the southern archipelago;,17
NA,equi-distant from the equator and from,17
NA,the setting sun. There is no doubt about,17
NA,that. Therefore I claim that we ought to,17
NA,add all possible attractions to our federal,17
NA,"city, by .selecting a soil of unsurpassed rich-",17
NA,"ness with a fascinating, undulating beauty",17
NA,"of surface, in a locality with a health-",17
NA,generating climate capable of nurturing a,17
NA,"sympathetic and noble-minded people',",17
NA,worthy to be the .central pivot of this,17
NA,southern empire of Australia.,17
Mr HUME COOK ,Bourke) - I desire,17
NA,to second the motion. I n doing so I would,17
NA,like to say that I do not exactly bind myself,17
NA,"to all the details contained within the motion,",17
NA,I but rather to the principles wliich i t bodies,17
NA,forth. Personally I do not think there is,17
NA,any necessity to lay stress on the capital,17
NA,being the property of tbe people of the Com-,17
NA,monwealth. I am inclined to think that,17
NA,"the Constitution Act, as given to us,' neces-",18
NA,sitates and renders mandatory that what-,18
NA,ever land is required for the Commonwealth,18
NA,capital purposes must belong to tbe people,18
NA,as a whole. I believe that was the inten-,18
NA,"tion of the framers of the Constitution, and",18
NA,that tbe first portion of section 125 of the,18
NA,Constitution Act makes that quite clear.,18
NA,That section provides-,18
NA,"The seat offcheGovernment of the Common""",18
NA,Wealth shall be determined by the Parliament',18
NA,and shall be within territory which shall have,18
NA,been granted fco or acquired by the Common-,18
NA,"wealth, and shall be. vested in and belong to",18
NA,the Commonwealth; and shall be in the State,18
NA,"of New South Wales, and be distant not less",18
NA,100 miles from Sydney.,18
NA,"The point I wish to make is, that i f the area",18
NA,for the federal capital is to be vested i n and,18
NA,"Ijelong to the Commonwealth, accordingto",18
NA,"the language of that"" section, i t cannot be-",18
NA,"long to any private persons, companies, ov",18
NA,"others. That seems perfectly clear, so that",18
NA,"whatever area is chosen, whether i t be 100",18
NA,"-square miles or more, the whole of that terri-",18
NA,tory so obtained for Commonwealth capital,18
NA,.site purposes must belong to the people and,18
NA,"cannot be sold or otherwise parted with,",18
NA,unless an alteration of the Constitution is,18
NA,"made. I do not think, therefore, that",18
NA,there is any great necessity to affirm in,18
NA,-connexion with this particular motion that,18
NA,the area shall for ever remain the property,18
NA,"-of the Commonwealth, because I hope that",18
NA,is to be the case under all circumstances.,18
NA,"""Neither with respect to the size of the",18
NA,-area do I think there is any great necessity,18
NA,to make an}' affirmation in the present,18
NA,motion. The Act is clear that the area,18
NA,"shall not be less than 100 square miles,",18
NA,but there is no limitation as to whether i t,18
NA,"shall be 100 square miles, 10,000 square",18
NA,"miles, or 20,000 square miles. I t is within",18
NA,"the province of this Parliament, and within",18
NA,"-the province of this Parliament alone, to de-",18
NA,termine how great an area shall be obtained,18
NA,"for this particular purpose. Personally, I",18
NA,have every confidence in the Government,18
NA,securing a sufficiently large area to fulfil,18
NA,all the purposes which my friend the honor-,18
NA,"able member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley,",18
NA,has so ably put forward.,18
Mr WILKS ,S o long as i t does not make,18
NA,for delay.,18
Mr HUME COOK , I do not flunk,18
NA,there is any fear of delay; I should hope,18
NA,"not, anyway. So far as 1 am personally con-",18
NA,"cerned I supposel may say, without appearing",18
NA,"i u the slightest degree selfish, that I hope",18
NA,"an area will be obtained as soon as possible,",18
NA,and a start made with the capital as soon,18
NA,as ever steps have been taken to determine,18
NA,"the position, and what is to be done",18
NA,in connexion with i t . There is no reason,18
NA,"for delay, except the delay caused i n choosing",18
NA,a particular site. But I do not wish to be,18
NA,"drawn from the point, namely, that there is",18
NA,no necessity to name in this motion any,18
NA,particular area. The Government is un-,18
NA,doubtedly just as wide awake as the mem-,18
NA,bers of the House are in respect to the,18
NA,"advantages of a large area, and will, as far",18
NA,"as possible, make the best bargain that can",18
NA,than be obtained for the Commonwealth of Aus-,18
NA,"tralia. Under these circumstances, i t is not",18
NA,so necessary to dwell on details in connexion,18
NA,with thg motion as to affirm certain principles.,18
NA,"The first principle I wish to affirm is, that fche",18
NA,"area for the capital, when obtained, ought",18
NA,to be larger than the area named i n the,18
NA,"Constitution Act, and that every portion of",18
NA,i t should be controlled and managed by the,18
NA,Government i n the interests of the Com-,18
NA,monwealth. I only repeat that for the,18
NA,"purpose of affirming, as the Act itself does,",18
NA,that this property should belong to the Com-,18
NA,"monwealth, and should be vested in and",18
NA,belong to the Commonwealth for all time.,18
NA,But I would desire to go somewhat,18
NA,"further. I f we are to build a city, that",18
NA,city will require certain conveniences.,18
NA,We cannot have an up-to-date city,18
NA,without having attached to i t all sorts,18
NA,"of conveniencies in the 'shape of railways,",18
NA,"and, i t may be, tramways, but certainly",18
NA,conveniences for lighting in the shape of,18
NA,"gas works or electrical works, together with",18
NA,waterworks and various other establish-,18
NA,"ments, all of which are incidental to a",18
NA,j,18
NA,"capital city, or indeed to any city. I hope",18
NA,that not only the land on which the,18
NA,city is built will belong to the people,18
NA,"of Australia, but that every one of the",18
NA,public conveniences connected with' the,18
NA,"city, such as waterworks, railways, tram-",18
NA,"ways and gasworks, will be owned, con-",18
NA,"trolled, and managed by and i n the",18
NA,interests of the people. We have an,18
NA,opportunity that is possibly unique i n,18
NA,the history of the world. I f we seize,18
NA,"that opportunity, we shall be able to",18
NA,present to the world a spectacle such as,18
NA,the world has not previously seen-a n en-,18
NA,"tire city, and all connected with the city,",18
NA,owned and managed for the people of Aus-,18
NA,"tralia. That being so, let me add that if",18
NA,there are to be any profits coming from the,18
NA,"area itself, all those profits should go into",19
NA,the pockets of the people-no t merely the,19
NA,"profits from the city itself, or the area on",19
NA,"which the actual buildings are erected, but",19
NA,"from the whole area, whatever i t is.",19
NA,Whether the land be built on or leased for,19
NA,"agriculture or other purposes, all the rents",19
NA,or profits coming from the ground itself,19
NA,ought to flow into the national treasury.,19
NA,"By that means,' what the honorable",19
NA,"member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley,'",19
NA,"desires, will take place. The unearned",19
NA,increment which must necessarily arise i n,19
NA,"connexion with a city of this kind, will go",19
NA,"not to persons, companies, or syndi-",19
NA,"cates, but to those who have a legiti-",19
NA,mate right to it-th e people. The area,19
NA,should be large enough to secure several,19
NA,"distinct advantages. I n the first place, we",19
NA,are necessarily limited by the Constitution.,19
NA,"The area, wherever i t is, must be in New",19
NA,South Wales. I t is somewhat a pity,19
NA,that we are restricted to one particular,19
NA,State. That restriction in my opinion,19
NA,"was a mistake, but inasmuch as i t is",19
NA,"embodied in tbe Constitution, we have to",19
NA,abide by it and do the best we can under the,19
NA,"circumstances. I , at any rate, propose to",19
NA,abide by the Constitution in this regard. I n,19
NA,"the next place, we should ""seek to get",19
NA,"an area which, as a first essential, has",19
NA,"a good climate: and, as a second essen-",19
NA,"tia], is easity accessible. We must have a",19
NA,"first-class water supply, and the. capital",19
NA,"city, wherever i t is, ought to be within",19
NA,reasonable distance of the more central,19
NA,parts of the Commonwealth. I n this,19
NA,second condition there are really three divi-,19
NA,"sions-climate , water supply, and accessi-",19
NA,"bility. A t the same time, as has been",19
NA,"pointed out by writers i n the press, and I",19
NA,think by some honorable members of this,19
NA,"House, the city should be sufficiently inland",19
NA,ancl remote from immediate attack to be,19
NA,quite safe. I t would be unwise to build a,19
NA,city of this kind right on tbe coast. We,19
NA,"do not want an enemy to make a raid, and",19
NA,"destroy a city which ought to be, and I hope",19
NA,"will be, an artistic monument, as well as",19
NA,"a centre of usefulness. The site ought,",19
NA,"therefore, to be sufficiently far inland to",19
NA,"preserve the city itself, and also to preserve",19
NA,"the national treasures, which, I suppose, will",19
NA,be properly stored there. But I think fur-,19
NA,"ther, and this is the main point of the argu-",19
NA,"ment, that tbe area of land ought to be large",19
NA,enough for something more than a mere city.,19
NA,There ought to be the benefit of agricultural,19
NA,and industrial development quite apart from,19
NA,the ground rents of the business premises,19
NA,connected with the city. We ought to,19
NA,secure an area which will feed the city,19
NA,quite apart from the city's own resources.,19
NA,"We should choose a site which, as far as",19
NA,"possible, will give us those advantages. The",19
NA,"city should be fed, and perhaps clothed, out of",19
NA,"its own resources, and for that reason all the",19
NA,area surrounding tlie city for many miles- I,19
NA,am not going to limit myself to any particular,19
NA,area-shoul d beowned by theConimonwealth.,19
NA,A l l that comes out of agricultural or in-,19
NA,dustrial development round about.this city,19
NA,ought also properly to belong to the Com-,19
NA,monwealth. This can only be obtained by,19
NA,acquiring an area greater than 100 square,19
NA,miles. I t is generally agreed that that,19
NA,area is too small. I do not know of any,19
NA,man who regards i t as sufficient. The,19
NA,aim that we are striving after can only,19
NA,be achieved by increasing the size. I,19
NA,hope that no town or hamlet will lie,19
NA,chosen just because i t happens to be i n,19
NA,existence. I do not favour any of the,19
NA,cities where large interests are already,19
NA,"created, such as Albury, Orange, or any",19
NA,other of the larger places that have been,19
NA,mentioned. I f we buy up huge interests,19
NA,"such as these, we shall be making a very",19
NA,great mistake from two points of view.,19
NA,I n the first place the site of the capital,19
NA,would cost us more than i t should. I n the,19
NA,second place we should not be able to build,19
NA,"that artistic and sanitary city, which we",19
NA,"hope to create, without pulling down or re-",19
NA,constructing any one of the towns already,19
NA,"indicated. Personally, as far as possible, I",19
NA,would seek to build acity which would benew,19
NA,from centre to circumference; which would,19
NA,"be up-to-date in every possible respect,",19
NA,and which would include no existing town,19
NA,or village. I f a town must be included,19
NA,"within tbe federal area, then the smallest",19
NA,"possible place ought to be selected, so that we",19
NA,should have to pay as little as possible for,19
NA,"reconstructing or removing i t . Moreover,",19
NA,if we purchase country where no such,19
NA,"vested'interests exist, i t will be very much",19
NA,easier for us to carry out tbe ideal we have,19
NA,in view than i f we select territory where,19
NA,they arefcobe found. The more we look at,19
NA,"this question, the more i t will appear to us",19
NA,thatfcheleast we have to do with existing,19
NA,towns or hamlets the better it will be for,19
NA,us. Another result of buying land which,19
NA,"included a town might be to give to persons,",19
NA,already looking forward to making some,19
NA,"profits, greater claims upon us than they",20
NA,have any right to possess. I do not know,20
NA,exactly how this matter can be overcome. I t,20
NA,may be that the Government -will be able to,20
NA,induce Parliament to pass an Act providing,20
NA,that the land required for the federal capi-,20
NA,tal site shall be taken over at the muni-,20
NA,cipal valuation at a certain date plus a cer-,20
NA,tain amount for its compulsory resumption.,20
NA,Ifc might be enacted that the municipal,20
NA,ation at an existing date shall be the basis,20
NA,"of purchase, plus 10 or 15 per cent, as com-",20
NA,pensation for taking away the necessary land,20
NA,required .for Commonwealth purposes. I,20
NA,am not certain whether that could be,20
NA,done.,20
Mr VL SOLOMON ,Hav e we tlie right,20
NA,to do so ?,20
Mr HUME COOK ," I do not know, but",20
NA,"something should be done to forestall,",20
NA,"as far as possible, the disproportionate and",20
NA,unfair'claims which the residents of some of,20
NA,these towns may make against us when we,20
NA,come to build our capital. I do not desire,20
NA,to take up the time of the House by discuss-,20
NA,ing details i n connexion with tbe question,20
NA,of how the money is to be raised to cany,20
NA,"out this work, nor do I wish to name any",20
NA,particular site which may appear to me to,20
NA,be sufficiently good for the purpose. I,20
NA,have no wish to deal with any other,20
NA,point incidental to the broad question. M y,20
NA,view is that we ought to treat this matter,20
NA,to-day rather from the point of view of,20
NA,principle than from the point of view of de-,20
NA,tail. I hope that when the federal capital,20
NA,is created i t will have an influence upon,20
NA,political and social life of bhe community at,20
NA,large. Every new city is a new centre of,20
NA,thought. There are too few such centres of,20
NA,thought in Australia. We are too much,20
NA,"dominated by fche great cities of Sydney,",20
NA,"Melbourne, and Adelaide, and too much",20
NA,dominated in those cities by ',20
NA,particular newspapers that we take. Every,20
NA,"new city created will therefore, to a large",20
NA,"extent, help to mould and develop the",20
NA,"thought of tbe continent, and tlie capital",20
NA,city of Australia ouglit to be the apex of,20
NA,the thought of the continent. I t ought,20
NA,to contain within its four comers the,20
NA,best and the brightest intellects that the,20
NA,"continent can gather together, and ifc ought",20
NA,to be a centre from which shall radiate the,20
NA,very best that is in Australia. That is the,20
NA,ideal view of fche question. We may never,20
NA,reach that ideal; but if we do not aim high,20
NA,.shall not hit much. I should like to see the,20
NA,ideal aimed at. I should like to see this,20
NA,city a commercial centre. The commercial,20
NA,element cannot be excluded or overlooked.,20
NA,"The capital city, however, should also be",20
NA,something like a model or type of art,20
NA,and refinement-th e artistic element cannot,20
NA,be overlooked. I f we read the words,20
NA,of the motion itself i t will be seen that,20
NA,this is a point which the honorable mem-,20
NA,valu- ber who moves i t has not forgotten. As,20
NA,we listened to his flowing sentences we.,20
NA,must have felt that the ajsthetical and,20
NA,"artistic, from his point of view, was",20
NA,more to be considered than any other,20
NA,matter to which he referred. The build--,20
NA,ing of this city may take some t i m e;,20
NA,"and, whilst we have no right to delay it, we",20
NA,have no right to hurry i t . I hope i t will,20
NA,embrace these three tilings-th e commercial,20
NA,"element, the public element-wherei n every-",20
NA,thing shall belong to the people of Aus-,20
NA,"tralia-an d the artistic element, which will",20
NA,make the city a fit repository of tlie nation's,20
NA,"treasures, and something like a symbol of",20
NA,"its greatness, its liberty, and its progress.",20
Mr WILKS ,Dalley) -A s a representa-,20
NA,"tive of New South Wales, I am pleased that",20
NA,the honorable member for Tasmania has,20
NA,brought this question forward. I hope that,20
NA,later on i n tlie debate the Prime Minister,20
NA,will make some statement to the House as to,20
NA,the intentions of the Government. We have,20
NA,listened to-day to the grandiloquent language,20
NA,"of tbe honorable member for Tasmania,",20
Mr OMALLEY ,"t o his rounded periods,",20
NA,and his wealth of imagery-languag e which,20
NA,the coming from me would sound very much like,20
NA,the words of a quack medicine advertise-,20
NA,"ment. I do not wish to repeat his style, but",20
NA,simply to say that we now have an oppor-,20
NA,"tunity of dealing with this question, although",20
NA,this is only an abstract motion. The Con-,20
NA,stitution provides that the area of tlie,20
NA,the federal capital shall be not less than 100,20
NA,square miles. Since the passing of the Con-,20
NA,"stitution Act, however, the Premier of New",20
NA,South Wales- a State which has a lot,20
NA,to do with this matter-ha s said that the,20
NA,Government of that State are prepared to,20
NA,grant an additional area of 15 miles,20
NA,"square, making a total of 25 miles square.",20
Mr BARTON ,The y made a reservation,20
NA,of 15 miles square.,20
Mr WILKS , That would mean 225,20
NA,"square miles as against 100 square miles,",20
NA,which is tbe area provided for i n,20
NA,we the Constitution - The Constitution ' Act,20
NA,also requires that . the site of the,20
NA,federal capital shall be not less than 100,21
NA,miles from Sydney. Although i t may not,21
NA,seem fit after the speech made by the honor-,21
NA,able member for Tasmania to deal with this,21
NA,"matter from a utilitarian stand-point, I can-",21
NA,not help saying that the granting of 225,21
NA,"square miles, mainly comprised of Crown",21
NA,"lands, is no small present to the Common-",21
NA,wealth.,21
Mr OMALLEY , W e want to pay for i t .,21
Mr WILKS ,If c would be difficult to,21
NA,find in New South Wales an area suitable for,21
NA,the purpose larger than I have named.,21
NA,hope that there will be no restrictions placed,21
NA,on the question of area. New South Wales,21
NA,wants this portion of the bargain completed,21
NA,speedily.,21
Mr OMALLEY , A n d so do we.,21
NA,1,21
Mr WILKS , I quite understand that,21
NA,the honorable member for Tasmania,21
NA,may hold a brief for the Government,21
NA,"whip, the honorable member for Eden",21
NA,"Mouaro, who representsBombala. He",21
NA,did his work very well indeed; but I do,21
NA,not wish to anticipate. Honorable members,21
NA,are to have an opportunityof visiting the,21
NA,various suitable sites i n New South Wales,21
NA,"for the purpose of obtaining information,",21
NA,"and for the purpose, I trust, of coming to",21
NA,an early decision. A l l that has been stated,21
NA,"by the last speaker, and by tlie mover, goes",21
NA,almost without saying. We trust tbat tbe,21
NA,erection of a suitable city on up-to-date,21
NA,principles will be carried out;' but we are,21
NA,not prepared to wait until the tune when,21
NA,the boy i nfchestreet will use the beautiful,21
NA,language which the honorable member for,21
NA,Tasmania used in introducing the. motion.,21
NA,Nor are we prepared to wait for the,21
NA,"city i n the clouds, which the last speaker",21
NA,so airily sketched. A l l we hope is that,21
NA,"the site will be selected, and that the city",21
NA,will be laid out to meet tlie requirements,21
NA,of the day and with possibilities for future,21
NA,development. I am not one of those who,21
NA,"think that, because we have a federal",21
NA,"capital, immediately around that capital",21
NA,will srather the intellect of the Common-,21
NA,wealth. Nor am I prepared to see,21
NA,"raised within a week, or a few hours, an",21
NA,Aladdin city which will astonish the world.,21
NA,"I do not expect anything of that sort, nor",21
NA,do I think that thepeopleof New South Wales,21
NA,"will expect i t . Perhaps we may be cast,",21
NA,i n an inferior mould; but we do hope that,21
NA,a suitable site will be obtained afc an early,21
NA,"moment, and that i t will not be such an area",21
NA,"as 1,000 square miles. I cannot under-",21
NA,stand why fche honorable member did not,21
NA,"suggest 2,000 square miles, so that we could",21
NA,resume the whole of Tasmania for the site of,21
NA,an ideal city. One of the reasons for,21
NA,accepting the Commonwealth Bill i n New,21
NA,South Wales was that the federal citv,21
NA,"would be established within the territory, aud",21
NA,the compromise made by its Prime Minis-,21
NA,"ter, Mr Reid, with the Prime Minister of",21
NA,"Victoria, Sir George Turner, was that that",21
NA,city should be not within 100 miles of,21
NA,Sydney. The reason for inserting that re-,21
NA,I striction to my mind was so that neither tbe,21
NA,commercial city of Sydney nor the commer-,21
NA,cial centre of Melbourne should obtain any,21
NA,"preference. That was the idea thrown out,",21
NA,"and i t was expressed, I suppose, by men i n",21
NA,their calmer moments. The people of New,21
NA,South Wales expect that city to be built,21
NA,"where all tbe surroundings are suitable, and",21
NA,that i t shall be as close as possible to that,21
NA,100-mile line. Although the Constitu-,21
NA,tion says that i t shall be net within,21
NA,"100 miles"" of Sydney, tbe people of New",21
NA,"South Wales expect, all things being equal,",21
NA,that i t shall be as near as possible to that,21
NA,line.,21
Mr CHAPMAN ,No t all the people of,21
NA,New South Wales.,21
Mr WILKS ,Th e larger portion of the,21
NA,people who decided the life of the Common-,21
NA,wealth Bill. Hundreds and thousands of,21
NA,persons voted for the acceptance of that Bill,21
NA,for the consideration that an area of not less -,21
NA,than 100 square miles as close as possible,21
NA,to that line should be the federal territory.,21
NA,But even on that point I do not think the,21
NA,"people of New South Wales feel so strongly,",21
NA,that i f a more suitable area were found,21
NA,some miles outside that line they would not,21
NA,be prepared for their representatives to sup-,21
NA,port tbe selection. . I hope that this motion,21
NA,will elicit from the Prime Minister a state-,21
NA,ment as -to whether any action has been,21
NA,"taken, and i f so, when the people of New",21
NA,South Wales can expect the choice of the,21
NA,federal site to be determined. So far as tlie,21
NA,"erection of the capital is concerned, I hope",21
NA,that when a site has been chosen by the,21
NA,"authorities and approved by this House, i t",21
NA,will not be necessary for this Parliament to,21
NA,wait until a palatial structure can be erected,21
NA,to suit either the demands or the wishes of .,21
NA,honorable members after tlie style which,21
NA,was suggested by the mover or the last,21
NA,speaker. I hope that the Commonwealth,21
NA,will keep the bargain which was made with,21
NA,New South Wales and obey the spirit of the,22
NA,"Constitution, and that immediately a site is",22
NA,selected a structure will be run up for the,22
NA,housing of the Parliament. After that i t,22
NA,will be a matter of development. I do not,22
NA,think tbat any man i n his calm senses,22
NA,anticipates that for many years the federal,22
NA,"city, because i t is the capital, will be sur-",22
NA,rounded by the wealth and prominence,22
NA,which some honorable members expect. I t,22
NA,will be simply a matter of development. I t,22
NA,will be the natural resources around that,22
NA,"area which will attract the population, and",22
NA,not fche fact that i t is the political centre,22
NA,Australia. I hope that the Prime Minister,22
NA,"will give an expression of opinion, because the",22
NA,"people of New South Wales, although not",22
NA,pushingfchequestion are as much concerned,22
NA,in its determination as is the honorable,22
NA,"member for Kalgoorlie, who gave notice",22
NA,of a motion this afternoon in regard to,22
NA,what he considered a bargain on behalf of,22
NA,Western Australia. We simply wish the,22
NA,"provision ""in the Constitution to be carried",22
NA,"out, and the opinion of the people, so far",22
NA,"as i t can be interpreted, is that, all things",22
NA,"being equal, the suitable site should be as",22
NA,close to the 100-mile radius as possible. Of,22
NA,course 1 can understand the honorable,22
NA,member for Tasmania being carried away,22
NA,by his sesthefcie nature into regions repre-,22
NA,sented by the most seductive member who,22
NA,represents Eden-Monaro.,22
Mr BARTON ,Hunter-Ministe r for,22
NA,"External Affairs) - I feel a little cold, after",22
NA,warming myself at the beacon fires l i t by the,22
NA,"honorable member for Tasmania, now that",22
NA,I have been placed under the cold douche of,22
NA,the speech of thehonovablememberfor Dalley.,22
NA,We have had the sentiment of the matter,22
NA,"fully developed i n one direction, and we",22
NA,"have had a good deal of common sense, per-",22
NA,"haps not quite optimistic enough, from my",22
NA,honorable friend on the other side. The,22
NA,question that has been raised by the honor-,22
NA,able member for Tasmania cannot be,22
NA,"said to be inopportunely raised, nor",22
NA,can any complaint be made as to,22
NA,the terms in which he has brought forward,22
NA,bis motion. But I think the House will,22
NA,"agree with me, that, considering the diffi-",22
NA,culties that may arise i n connexion with,22
NA,"the selection of a capital, i t would not be",22
NA,a good thing for the country at large to,22
NA,have too many restrictions laid down at this,22
NA,stage. We all know that 'the site which,22
NA,we are to choose must be a healthy one.,22
NA,.We all know that i t must be well watered.,22
NA,"I t will not do to have a capital, the popula-",22
NA,"tion of which will from time to time increase,",22
NA,"and to find after a generation or two, or",22
NA,perhaps even earlier i f the place is.,22
NA,"lucky, that the needs of the population",22
NA,in respect of water supply are insuffi-,22
NA,ciently met by any reasonable engineer-,22
NA,"ing use of the facilities in tlie district, and",22
NA,"that therefore the capital has to be removed,",22
NA,although a village may remain i n the,22
NA,old spot. That would never do. I n the,22
NA,same way we must not insist on fer-,22
NA,"tility, within tbe particular area as an",22
NA,of essential requirement. And why? Wherever,22
NA,the capital is there -will be Inter-State,22
NA,free-trade. I t will be able to derive,22
NA,"its supplies from the surrounding country,",22
NA,and so long as i t is near to land which is,22
NA,fertile that will be sufficient so far as its,22
NA,own supplies are concerned. I can easily,22
NA,imagine a case i n which the choice might,22
NA,"be between good agricultural laud, well",22
NA,"watered for the raising of crops, but too",22
NA,low and not healthy enough for the site,22
NA,"of the capital, and good hilly country,",22
NA,"quite near to it, with an abundant water",22
NA,"supply, which would more amply satisfy",22
NA,all conditions both as to picturesqueness,22
NA,and healthiness of situation. That is one,22
NA,reason why we should not tie ourselves,22
NA,down. I intend to move an amendment,22
NA,"which will go as far as the Government,",22
NA,think we ought to go in the direction of any,22
NA,restriction. I n that amendment I have not-,22
NA,provided for any particular area by way of,22
NA,"measurement, because i t strikes me that",22
NA,that would be fatal to the very object we,22
NA,"have in view. Now, as to this matter of",22
NA,"area, which would be the better thing-t o",22
NA,"take 1,500 or2,000 square miles of land",22
NA,not perfectly suitable to contain the capital',22
NA,"city and its appanages, or to take 700, 800,",22
NA,or 900 square miles of iand perfectly suitable,22
NA,for all the purposes of a capital territory ?,22
NA,I t is clear that i f we lay down the mini-,22
NA,"mum of 1,000 square miles, we may find",22
NA,ourselves passing by the most adapt-,22
NA,able site we could find i n Australia.,22
NA,The Constitution has made a restriction,22
NA,that shuts out two of the most eligible sites,22
NA,"in Australia, one i n New South Wales and",22
NA,the other in Victoria. I refer to the Moss.,22
NA,"Vale district and the Ballarat district. For,",22
NA,whatever may be said as to the site of the-,22
NA,"capital, I think every one to whom I have-",22
NA,spoken on the subject agrees that among,22
NA,the finest sites are the two districts I have-,22
NA,"just named. But the Constitution having,",22
NA,"by its own operation, cut us off from tlie",23
NA,"selection of either of those places, has",23
NA,reduced the number of suitable sites ; aud 1,23
NA,think we should see to i t that Ave do not,23
NA,further reduce them by unnecessary restric-,23
NA,tions. ' I agree with a very great deal of what,23
NA,has been said by the honorable member for,23
NA,Bourke as to the requirements. I agree,23
NA,with his line of argument against undue re-,23
NA,strictions. We might leave a good deal 'of,23
NA,common ground between tbe motion and,23
NA,"the amendment I intend to submit, and",23
NA,avoid the dangers into which I think we,23
NA,should fall by adopting the motion as i t,23
NA,stands. I propose to omit all the words,23
NA,"after "" area "" with a view to substituting the",23
NA,"following, i n which I retain some of the",23
NA,words offchemotion :-,23
NA,"Of land well watered, healthily situated, and",23
NA,large enough to fully meet all probable re-,23
NA,"quirements, and secure to the Commonwealth",23
NA,the benefits to accrue from the position of the,23
NA,"capital, such area when secured to remain for",23
NA,"ever the property of the Commonwealth, the",23
NA,"ground only to be let to utilizers, all buildings",23
NA,"be erected under strict regulations, with due",23
NA,regard to public health and architectural beauty.,23
NA,I think that amendment should satisfy tlie,23
NA,desires of the honorable member who has,23
NA,"moved this motion, and should also satisfy",23
NA,"the House, without running into any undue",23
NA,restrictions which might limit our choice,23
NA,hereafter. The question of water is so very,23
NA,important in Australia that i t is necessary,23
NA,to be very careful i u our choice from that,23
NA,point of view.,23
Mr OMALLEY , W e can get that in the,23
NA,Snowy Elver district.,23
Mr BARTON ,Ther e are some well-,23
NA,watered spots that would never do for a,23
NA,"capital, and there are many badly watered",23
NA,"spots' that, if they were not in that condition,",23
NA,would be among the best sites in Australia.,23
NA,We are restricted enough by nature as,23
NA,matters stand ; do not let us add to the re-,23
NA,strictions unnecessarily.,23
Mr A MCLEAN ,I s i t wise to pass any,23
NA,"motion 1 We are all agreed, I think.",23
Mr BARTON ,I f we were to negative,23
NA,"this motion, there are propositions i n i t o f",23
NA,such a character that i t would seem to all,23
NA,Australia that we had improperly negatived,23
NA,it. We are in that difficulty. The wiser,23
NA,"course to pursue, if we do not negative the",23
NA,"motion, is to alter it-becaus e as i t stands i t",23
NA,would unduly restrict our choice-an d add,23
NA,other words which would place tine matter,23
NA,upon what we consider to be proper lines. I,23
NA,may state further that tbe Goverhmenthave,23
NA,been in communication with tine Government,23
NA,"of New South AVales, ancl are likely to re-",23
NA,"ceive ""further assistance from them, upon",23
NA,"the subject. W i t h regard to the area,'",23
NA,we were told i n a paper received from,23
NA,the Government of New South AVales that,23
NA,in tlie sites recommended by the Federal,23
NA,"Capital Commissioner, Mr Alexander Oliver,",23
NA,1,23
NA,Crown land of an area of 15 miles radius,23
NA,was to be reserved from sale. .AVe found,23
NA,soon afterwards tbat i t was not an area of,23
NA,"15 miles radius, but of 15 miles square.",23
NA,The radius was of course the better thing,23
NA,both for the Commonwealth and for New,23
NA,"South Wales, because that would mean",23
NA,"something like 700 square miles, whilst",23
NA,an area of 15 miles square would - only,23
NA,represent 225 square miles A\ e have made a,23
NA,7,23
NA,representation upon that subject to the New,23
NA,"South AVales Government, ancl have no",23
NA,doubt that i n anything i n regard to the,23
NA,matter we shall meet with an attentive and,23
NA,willing hearing from the Ministry of New,23
NA,"to South AVales, who, judging from tbe atti-",23
NA,tude which they have assumed hitherto-,23
NA,and which I think would be tbe attitude,23
NA,of any Government existing i n New South,23
NA,Wales-wil l give every facility for making,23
NA,"a fair and free choice. As to tbe area,",23
NA,"question, there are some who even think",23
NA,"that we should have 10,000, 50,000, or",23
NA,"100,000 square miles. That is not within the-",23
NA,contemplation of tbe Constitution. I t was.,23
NA,never intended that any federal territory i u,23
NA,a fairly densely populated state should reach,23
NA,such dimensions. I t is all very well to have-,23
NA,presented to us some hundreds of millions of,23
NA,"acres, in the Northern Territory of South",23
NA,Australia.,23
Mr VL SOLOMON ,-Yo v a moderate,23
NA,consideration.,23
Mr BARTON ,"Yes , under a burden of",23
NA,"£100,000 a year, which might put us in the",23
NA,position that Lord Rosebery deprecated,23
NA,"the other day when, i u his letter to the",23
NA,"City of London Liberal Club, he declined",23
NA,to place himself in the situation of a,23
NA,"""strong ass between two burdens."" I t",23
NA,would not do to take for tlie capital a,23
NA,territory which i t is not intended to de-,23
NA,"velop into a State, and to endow i t with an",23
NA,area which would really qualify i tfcobe a,23
NA,"State. Therefore, 1 do not think ifc was",23
NA,within the contemplation of the framers of,23
NA,the Constitution at all that we should go,23
NA,beyond that which will be handy and adapt-,23
NA,"able as -the territory of the Commonwealth,",23
NA,particularly i n consideration of tbe fact_of,23
NA,its being situatedj in one of the largest,24
NA,"State3, and also, as i t must be, fairly",24
NA,"sible to a large population. Now, the",24
NA,visions of the Constitution i n this respect,24
NA,seem to me to point very clearly to what,24
NA,intended. I n section 125 we are told_,24
NA,that-,24
NA,The seat of Government of the Commonwealth,24
NA,"-shall be determined by the Parliament, and",24
NA,be within territory which shall have been granted,24
NA,"-to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall",24
NA,"be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth,",24
NA,"and, if New South Wales be an original",24
NA,".shall be in that Stato, and be distant not",24
NA,100 miles from Sydney.,24
NA,Then we find another reference to the,24
NA,"tion i n the 122nd section, which tells",24
NA,that-,24
NA,The Parliament may make laws for the govern-,24
NA,ment of any territory surrendered -by any State,24
NA,"to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of",24
NA,territory placed by the Queen under the authority,24
NA,-of aud accepted by the Commonwealth or,24
NA,"wise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may",24
NA,-allow the representation of such territory in,24
NA,House of tbe Parliament to the extent and on,24
NA,terms wliich it thinks fit.,24
NA,One may well suppose a territory like,24
NA,of tbe northern part of South Australia,24
NA,"coming i n time a State, but I do not think",24
NA,i t was ever the intention of the framers,24
NA,"this Constitution to dictate,",24
NA,"any way, that the federal territory should",24
NA,"become a State, unless some overwhelmment",24
NA,ing necessity arose that i t should do so.,24
NA,There is another reason why I should,24
NA,"strong i n that contention, and that",24
NA,I f such a territory became a State i t would,24
NA,"require to be represented i n the Senate, and",24
NA,probably would obtain a representation,24
NA,'equal to that of those much larger areas of,24
NA,"which Tasmania is the smallest, though i",24
NA,is still much larger than any territory,24
NA,should secure for the capital.,24
Mr CROUCH ,-I s that so for new States,24
Mr BARTON ,"No , but if we make a",24
NA,"new State, we must give i t representation",24
NA,"in the Senate, and that might lead, to",24
NA,"extent, to an overwhelming of that balance",24
NA,or equilibrium between States,24
NA,"have attempted to institute, and do",24
NA,want unduly to unhinge or destroy. I do,24
NA,not want to speak at great length on,24
NA,this matter. Honorable members will see,24
NA,from the way I have dealt with i t that,24
NA,there is no prejudgment as to sites,24
NA,part of the Government. This territory is,24
NA,doubt to be ultimately selected by the,24
NA,ral Parliament from such land as shall,24
NA,offered to i t by New South Wales. I think,24
NA,the Constitution itself contemplates that-,24
NA,accesthe offer shall be. made under any circum-,24
NA,"prostances by New South Wales, and any",24
NA,action beyond the acceptance of one of the,24
NA,is offers made is not intended to be undertaken,24
NA,by the Commonwealth except as a last re-,24
NA,source. That I feel secure about. But I do not,24
NA,think we need fear great difficulties on that,24
NA,"shall point, when we consider how ready that",24
NA,"State has been, so far as we have gone, to offer",24
NA,further areas. Honorable members will find,24
NA,"State, from the correspondence, which they can",24
NA,"less than see, that the Government of New South",24
NA,Wales is willing to offer further areas,24
NA,quesbeyond those mentioned i n the commis-,24
NA,us sioner's report. I t has asked our opinion,24
NA,"upon that subject, and we have replied that",24
NA,we think ifc is for New South Wales to make,24
NA,"tlie offers in the first instance, and that we",24
NA,any shall be ready to receive any such offers.,24
NA,"That is i n the first iustance, of course,",24
NA,otherbecause the Constitution must not only be,24
NA,"either consulted, but i t is a matter of tact and",24
NA,the good policy to consult tbe wishes and feelings,24
NA,of the State which is most concerned. That,24
NA,that does not of course prevent any last re-,24
NA,"becourse there may be under the Constitution,",24
NA,"but I hope the day for that is far distant,",24
NA,of and that we shall never have any resort,24
NA,or to require i n to i t at all.,24
Mr WILKS , A t what date is the Govern-,24
NA,likely to deal with this matter ?,24
Mr BARTON ,Th e honorable member,24
NA,be may just as well ask me at what date we,24
NA,is this : will bring i n the Tariff.,24
Mr WILKS ,"In November or December,",24
NA,or what month t,24
Mr BARTON ,W e cannot deal with,24
NA,"t this matter in any particular month, because",24
NA,we there is a continuous dealing with ifc going,24
NA,on. There is. correspondence going on with,24
NA,1 a view to arriving afc something definite as,24
NA,to what can be offered i n addition to the,24
NA,sites already placed under offer and men-,24
NA,a large tioned i n the commissioner's report!,24
Mr WILKS , I am referring to the,24
NA,which we inspection of sites.,24
Mr BARTON ,"There , again, I have",24
NA,a difficulty ' in answering the honorable,24
NA,"member, and I think he will appreciate",24
NA,"it. The work of this session is very full,",24
NA,and the business - paper contains a large,24
NA,on the number of most important measures. I,24
NA,no think we shall be lucky if we get away from,24
NA,Fedehere much before Christmas. Tf we were,24
NA,be to lay i t down that we would institute,24
NA,"an inspection of the sites, and fix the",24
NA,"time now, we might be throwing our-",25
NA,selves beyond any proper date at which,25
NA,"the session ought to close. I am, therefore,",25
NA,reluctant to name any date within the ses-,25
NA,sion for the purpose. I t is not a tiling to,25
NA,"force i n any way, because the site re-",25
NA,"quires the satisfaction of this ,Parlia-",25
NA,"ment, as well as the satisfaction of",25
NA,the State of New South Wales. While,25
NA,we are strong i n our desire to have an,25
NA,early choice made-an d no one feels more,25
NA,strongly than I do that the matter should,25
NA,be dealt with as early as possible-w e feel,25
NA,that we must have the good-will of Parlia-,25
NA,ment witb us in making the choice. AVe,25
NA,"must, therefore, - allow for inspection by",25
NA,Member's of Parliament at the proper time.,25
NA,"Now, as to the proper time, the question",25
NA,arises whether the sites should not first be,25
NA,narrowed down by some reference to such,25
NA,"questions as accessibility, engineering facili-",25
NA,"ties, and an abundant supply of water. A l l",25
NA,"these conditions must exist, and of course",25
NA,an abundant supply of water is the first,25
NA,requisite. The inquiry wliich will be insti-,25
NA,tuted on these points will show' to what,25
NA,"extent the sites can be narrowed down,",25
NA,"in respect, for instance, of the water ques-",25
NA,"tion, which is the most important of all.",25
NA,AVhen once we have information upon that,25
NA,"point, I think we shall be able to arrange",25
NA,"for visits by the whole Parliament, or by a",25
NA,committee of Parliament i n the first in-,25
NA,"stance, as may be determined. But I can-",25
NA,not hold out a promise that that can be,25
NA,done while we have the immediate pressure,25
NA,upon us of all the matters that are en-,25
NA,gaging the public mind at the present,25
NA,moment. Honorable members may rely,25
NA,"upon this, that there is no one more",25
NA,anxious that this question should be,25
NA,"brought to a speed}' determination, con-",25
NA,"sistently .with good judgment, than I am. I",25
NA,welcome the co-operation of all honorable,25
NA,"members i n the matter. This, least of",25
NA,"all, is a party question. Ifc is one i n",25
NA,which Ministerialists and Oppositionists can,25
NA,"work heartily together, giving, of course,",25
NA,every consideration to the interests of the,25
NA,"State concerned, but realizing that the in-",25
NA,terests of the future generations of this,25
NA,Commonwealth are the most important of all.,25
NA,"To me, as a native of New South AA ales, i t is",25
NA,"a subject of especial gratification,",25
NA,time the capital is likely to be i n that State.,25
NA,"But my nativity there, and my natural pre-",25
NA,judice in favour of the place i n which I was,25
NA,"born, do not blind me to fche fact that the",25
NA,[179] .,25
NA,"choice should be careful, and, i f necessary,",25
NA,very deliberate-althoug h i t should not be,25
NA,too prolonged-s o that we may have a capi,25
NA,tal which will preserve the best conditions,25
NA,"for the future, of this Commonwealth, not",25
NA,merely i n respect of fche particular fad or,25
NA,"eccentricity of any of us, but i n respect of",25
NA,the interests of the generations that are to,25
NA,come.,25
Mr MAHON ,Befor e sitting down will,25
NA,the right honorable gentleman say whether,25
NA,he will ask the Government of New South,25
NA,"AVales, i n the event of the Common-",25
NA,"wealth having to acquire any territory, to.",25
NA,pass an Acfc^ so fchafc the land may be-,25
NA,acquired at the prairie value.,25
Mr BARTON , I t is the intention of,25
NA,the Government to see that there is no,25
NA,room for the land gambler in respect of the,25
NA,acquirement of this site. AVherever else he,25
NA,"may have free play, I think his claws should'",25
NA,be off the site of the federal capital. Our,25
NA,"desire is, and we intend to secure i t i f i t is",25
NA,"humanly possible,fchafcthere should be some",25

NA,"fco, the 1st of January of this year, before",25
NA,speculative and fancy values began fco,25

NA,they will see that he says-,27
NA,The'federal territory site of 125 square miles,27
NA,"(80,000 acres).is, in my opinion, altogether",27
NA,"quate, and an extension of area is suggested",27
NA,"which would increase the area up to 1,200 square",27
NA,miles approximately.,27
NA,That is ' Mr Oliver's suggestion after having,27
NA,"visited all -the various sites, and having",27
NA,made the most careful inquiries. Mr.,27
NA,Oliver had 'the benefit of the opinions of,27
NA,"various trained experts, and also the benefit",27
NA,"of special surveys of th'e country, the",27
NA,"gauging of water supplies, and other",27
NA,details which were necessary before any,27
NA,one could approach a subject of this kind,27
NA,with any degree of certainty. Mr Oliver,27
NA,was chosen for this particular task as one,27
NA,"having special knowledge of the country,",27
NA,ancl as being generally well qualified for,27
NA,tho work. 'He recommends us to go even,27

NA,"tion, and as an Australian, I say that the",27
NA,federal capital ought' to be placed on the,27
NA,"very best site .available. I go further, and",27
NA,say that we ought to require something,27
NA,besides what has been outlined by the Prime,27
NA,"Minister, and i f I felt disposed to narrow",27
NA,"the choice down, I should add to the motion",27
NA,the following words-,27
NA,Also that the federal territory should embrace,27
NA,"within its limits a natural harboror port, over",27
NA,wliich theCommonwealth should have supreme,27
NA,control.,27
NA,"I feel, however, that i f I were to do any-",27
NA,"thing of that kind, I should be .acting",27
NA,contrary to the liberal spirit shown by the,27
NA,"Prime Minister, and therefore I am glad",27
NA,that the honorable member who placed this,27
NA,-suggestion i n my hands gave i t to the right,27
NA,"person. I persuaded him not to move i t ,",27
NA,because while i t would probably denote,27
NA,"where tlie federal capital ought to be,",27
NA,I feel that we ought to have a free and,27
NA,unfettered choice. One honorable member,27
NA,"has stated that, all things being equal, we",27
NA,ought to fix the site of the federal capital,27
NA,as near as possible to the port of Sydney;,27
NA,"but, although I represent a Hew South",27
NA,"Wales constituency, I refuse to grant that",27
NA,inade- Sydney has .any inherent right to tlie trade,27
NA,that will accrue from the establishment of,27
NA,the'federal capital. What right has Sydney,27
NA,"to this advantage any more than Melbourne,",27
NA,"Hobart, or any other port i n the States ?",27
NA,Ho doubt there will be a .great trade arise,27
NA,"in connexion with the federal capital, and",27
NA,"further, i t will probably enrich those who",27
NA,happen to have that trade in their control.,27
NA,I t is amusing to read the reports i n the,27
NA,"Sydney daily papers, which point out what",27
NA,an awful blunder was made in limiting the,27
NA,area within which the federal capital should,27
NA,beestablished to the countiy beyond 100,27
NA,miles from Sydney. I f we concede to,27
NA,"the honorable member -for Dalley that,",27
NA,"other things being equal, perhaps i t might",27
NA,be desirable to establish the federal capital,27
NA,as near as possible to the bounds of the,27
NA,100 -miles limit. We ask are all other things,27
NA,equal? Is there any comparison between,27
NA,placing the federal capital on good open,27
NA,"fertile countiy land, that could be resumed",27
NA,"at a small expenditure, and taking land close",27
NA,"to the centres of population, which would",27
NA,have to be acquired at prices that would,27
NA,run the Commonwealth into a very heavy,27
NA,"outlay, and at the same time result, perhaps,",27
NA,in the city being perched upon some moun-,27
NA,tain craig or buried in the midst of a swamp?,27
NA,"A t any rate, i f all things were equal there",27
NA,"might be something in the contention, but I",27
NA,think the honorable -member will see tbat,27
NA,"all things are not equal. Especially, we",27
NA,must not forget the equal rights of those,27
NA,who have been debarred f r o m . having the,27
NA,federal capital i n their own State. I regret,27
NA,we have not a free and unfettered choice;,27
NA,because. if there had been a better site in,27
NA,"Victoria, Tasmania, or any other State for",27
NA,"a federal capital site, I see no reason why",27
NA,the capital should not have been placed,27
NA,there. But the. point having been settled,27
NA,"by the Constitution Act, there can be only",27
NA,one reason-underlying the insidious sugges-,27
NA,tion that is being made at times that we,27
NA,might alter the Constitution. I t is pointed,27
NA,out that i t is the Vicborians who are trying,28
NA,to engineer the matter; hut this is being,28
NA,"clone by tlie monopolists' of Sydney, who,",28
NA,if they could break down the provision for,28
NA,"the 100 miles radius, would endeavour to",28
NA,have the capital brought right into Sydney,28
NA,"itself. I t has, however, been fixed by the",28
NA,Constitution Act that the federal capital,28
NA,"must be i n New South Wales, and not",28
NA,"less than 100 miles from Sydney, and",28
NA,any attempt to alter tbe Constitution i n,28
NA,that respect will receive my strongest,28
NA,opposition. I do not want to detain,28
NA,"the House, because an opportunity will be",28
NA,afforded honorable members later on of,28
NA,discussing the matter at length. The Prime,28
NA,Minister struck the right keynote when he,28
NA,said that first of all we must have an un-,28
NA,limited water supply. We must have tbe,28
NA,purest water supply on God's earth.,28
Mr OMALLEY ," Hear, hear ! Snowy",28
NA,River.,28
Mr CHAPMAN , Not only must we,28
NA,"have a supply of pure water, but we must",28
NA,have plenty of i t . There must be no,28
NA,"measurement of gallons per head, or any-",28
NA,thing of that sort. I t would be a fatal,28
NA,blunder if this capital were located in a place,28
NA,where we could not have not only a supply,28
NA,"of pure water, but an unlimited supply.",28
NA,There should be sufficient to run through the,28
NA,drains and sewers without necessitating the,28
NA,turning off of a tap in a large city such as,28
NA,is bound to spring up.,28
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Wher e is there,28
NA,such a place ?,28
Mr CHAPMAN ,Th e honorable mem-,28
NA,ber who puts that question had better ask me,28
NA,where London is. He is evidently not up,28
NA,"in the geography of the world, or he would",28
NA,"know that the place is i n Southern Monara,",28
NA,"which is "" in the running"" as the federal",28
NA,"capital site, and has more than "" Buckley's """,28
NA,"chance. There are two sites there which,",28
NA,"i n my opinion, are superior, to any other",28
NA,sites that are offered. I trust .honorable,28
NA,members will have the opportunity before,28
NA,this year runs out of inspecting that dis-,28
NA,"trict; and, after the information which the",28
NA,"Prime Minister has promised, we will be",28
NA,able to say which is the better of the two,28
NA,"sites I have mentioned. But, besides an un-",28
NA,"limited supply of pure water, we should",28
NA,"have a climate equal to any, if not the best, member not credit fhe proper",28
NA,in Australia. That is another,28
NA,should certainly insist upon. Then we,28
NA,"should have a fertile soil, which having",28
NA,"resumed, and being suitable for closer settle-",28
NA,"ment, would enable a large number of people",28
NA,"to gain a livelihood, irrespective of the fact",28
NA,that the federal capital is there. These are,28
NA,"three essentials, and we should have a good",28
NA,"site for the laying out of a model city, built",28
NA,on lines gathered from the best experts and,28
NA,"architects of the world, and of which we",28
NA,may be proud. A person will as soon think,28
NA,"of visiting Australia without going ""to the",28
NA,capital as we would of visiting England,28
NA,without seeing London. Then we want,28
NA,"what tbe honorable member for Tasmania,",28
NA,"Mr O'Malley, desires-beautifu l scenery,",28
NA,"with building materials close at hand, and a",28
NA,central position in relation to the four Or five,28
NA,large centres of population. I t is a remark-,28
NA,able fact that Southern Monara is i n a,28
NA,"central position, and, within a few miles",28
NA,may be said to -be tbe half-way house be-,28
NA,tween Sydney and Melbourne. I do not,28
NA,"believe there is a difference of ten miles,",28
NA,between the distance of Southern Mon-,28
NA,ara from Sydney and the distance,28
NA,"from Melbourne, and that is a matter",28
NA,which ought to be considered in the,28
NA,selection of the federal capital site.,28
NA,Then we ought to have a federal port.,28
NA,I would fight strenuously for a^federal port,28
NA,that we could fortif y and use for our federal,28
NA,"navy, and at the same time be under no",28
NA,obligation to any particular State. Such a,28
NA,"port ought to be within, reasonable distance",28
NA,"of the capital, and, at the same time be",28
NA,sufficiently far away to prevent the capital,28
NA,being bombarded from the waters sur-,28
NA,rounding that port. The honorable ancl,28
NA,learned member for Werriwa is quite right,28
NA,in saying that a port of this kind is known,28
NA,as Twofold Bay. Another important matter,28
NA,i t would be well for us to' consider is how,28
NA,we are going to raise the money for acquir-,28
NA,ing this area. That is a question which will,28
NA,"have to be debated presently, but I would",28
NA,suggest that i t might be worth while con-,28
NA,sidering whether we should not adopt a,28
NA,similar system to that adopted in Canada.,28
NA,"I n the Dominion, banks are compelled to",28
NA,hold a certain portion of their reserves i n,28
NA,Government securities ; and by that means,28
NA,"we could acquire this territory, even more",28
NA,"than 1,000 square miles, and i t would cost",28
NA,the people of this country hardly a shilling.,28
Mr MAHON ,Why does the honorable,28
NA,authority,28
NA,essential we with that suggestion 1,28
Mr CHAPMAN ," I was about to say,",28
NA,"been when the honorable member interrupted me,",28
NA,that I got the suggestion from the Bulletin.,29
NA,I am always pleased to admit having taken,29
NA,"an idea of the kind from the Bulletin,",29
NA,and I think that if we were to conduct,29
NA,our politics more on the lines advo-,29
NA,cated by that newspaper we should have,29
NA,a much better country. I am pleased to,29
NA,"think that, besides advocating the taking",29
NA,"of 5,000 square miles, the Bulletin points",29
NA,out the undeniable truth that there is,29
NA,only one place where that can be done to,29
NA,"the advantage of the people, and that is",29
NA,Southern Monaro. I am glad to find that,29
NA,the honorable member for Coolgardie admires,29
NA,"tbe Bulletin, and I trust he will follow that",29
NA,"newspaper's suggestion right through, so",29
NA,that we may have the federal capital i n the,29
NA,proper place. The same newspaper points,29
NA,"out that i f 5,000 square miles be taken",29
NA,"instead of 1,000 square miles, and that if",29
NA,"the site be in the Monaro district,",29
NA,the area might include the great and,29
NA,"rising towns of Cooma, Bombala, Delegate,",29
NA,"Niniitybelle, Bibbenluke, and Buckley's",29
NA,crossing. The Bulletin goes on to say,29
NA,tbat Cooma and Bombala are valued at,29
NA,"£290,800, Cooma being valued at £218,100,",29
NA,"ancl Bombala at £72,700 ; and that the",29
NA,"other places, although they have no",29
NA,"municipal valuation, would about make",29
NA,"up another Bombala, running up the",29
NA,total valuation of town property to,29
NA,"£370,000.",29
Mr CONROY ,Th e honorable member has,29
NA,"omitted Queenbeyan, which is also in his",29
NA,electorate.,29
Mr CHAPMAN ,Tim e does not permit,29
NA,me to refer to the advantages possessed,29
NA,by all the different localities; but at a,29
NA,"future time, when the question as to the",29
NA,"federal capital is entered on seriously, I",29
NA,will place facts before honorable members,29
NA,"in such a clear and convincing way,",29
NA,that ifc will not require much ad-,29
NA,vocacy on my part to persuade honorable,29
NA,members as to which is the best site.,29
NA,I feel that ifc is best for a man to convince,29
NA,"himself, and I am sure that as soon as",29
NA,honorable members inspect these different,29
NA,sites they will be able to satisfy themselves,29
NA,"on the point. I would say further, that I",29
NA,"am cpiite in accord with the Bulletin again,",29
NA,when i t points out that the difference be-,29
NA,tween the Commonwealth Government buy-,29
NA,ing a large area and a small one is that by,29
NA,purchasing a large tract of country they,29
NA,would put fche unearned increment-whic h,29
NA,"in the case offcheacquisition of 5,000 square",29
NA,miles would amount almost at once to,29
NA,"something like £6,000,000-int o the pockets",29
NA,of fche people instead of allowing the land,29
NA,speculator to come in. I have no desire to,29
NA,labour this question. I am thoroughly in,29
NA,"accord with the amendment, ancl I hope",29
NA,that the words of the Prime Minister will,29
NA,strike deep into tlie hearts of honorable,29
NA,members. I trust we shall have no small,29
NA,party spirit in dealing with this question.,29
NA,I have no fear of any line of demarcation,29
NA,between the Opposition and the Govern-,29
NA,"ment i n the matter. I t is to be hoped,",29
NA,"however, that those honorable members who",29
NA,have the honour to represent the city and,29
NA,suburban constituencies of New South,29
NA,Wales will recognise that Sydney is not,29
NA,"New South Wales, ancl that we have some-",29
NA,thing more to consider than the rights of!,29
NA,"those who are fortunate, or unfortunate",29
NA,"enough, to be located in those big centres.",29
NA,We have now an opportunity of try-,29
NA,ing land nationalization. Let us see,29
NA,how the policy we have so long,29
NA,"preached will come out in practice, and",29
NA,let us show the people of Australia that we,29
NA,recognise that centralization is bad. Ifc,29
NA,would be a grand thing for Australia i f we,29
NA,had a great many more cities distributed,29
NA,"through the States, instead of having the",29
NA,mass of the people congregated in four or,29
NA,five large centres. We have an opportunity,29
NA,"now, and we should avail ourselves of i t .",29
NA,We know that the State Government will,29
NA,provide all the Crown lands. Some honor-,29
NA,"able members, however, appear to me to",29
NA,"put too much stress on that point, because",29
NA,they fail to remember that the available,29
NA,Crown lands i n anything like reasonable,29
NA,positions are no good. The people have,29
NA,"already taken up the good Crown lands, and",29
NA,therefore i t is better that we should pay £ 2,29
NA,or £ 3 per acre for good private land than,29
NA,that we should accept a present of bad,29
NA,Crown areas. These private lands have been,29
NA,selected in years past because of their,29
NA,"superior quality, ancl by tbe closer settlement",29
NA,necessarily connected with the erection of a,29
NA,large city we should soon make ifc worth,29
NA,"£10, or £15, or £ 2 0 per acre for cultivation",29
NA,and other purposes. Great profit would,29
NA,thus accrue to the Commonwealth. I wel-,29
NA,come this proposition with very great,29
NA,pleasure. I hope that within three or four,29
NA,3-ears' time at the outside we shall be meet-,29
NA,"ing i n tbe federal capital,, I feel confident",29
NA,that the people recognise that the Govern-,29
NA,"ment are in earnest in this matter, and that",29
NA,they intend at the first opportunity to,30
NA,select a suitahle site and' build the,30
NA,capital. When th'e Government progamut,30
NA,"pose to adopt such a course, I-feel assured States-for",30
NA,"that they will have the support of ""honorable",30
NA,"members, not only on each side of . this",30
NA,"House, but also tbe support' of'honorable",30
NA,members in the other Chamber: I t is,30
NA,recognised that we are only i n temporary,30
NA,"quartei'S here, and every honorable member",30
NA,is anxiousto get asearly as possible to that,30
NA,home which he will endeavour to make,30
NA,convenient.,30
Mr OMALLEY ,W e shall not be there,30
NA,within ten years.,30
Mr CHAPMAN , I do not agree with federal',30
NA,the honorable member.,30
Mr OMALLEY ,W e do not want to live,30
NA,in a woolshed.,30
Mr CHAPMAN ,Th e honorable memimportant point.,30
NA,ber woidd live ascomfortably in a. 6 kS-,30
NA,tent i n Southern Monaro as he would i n a Government.,30
NA,mansion i n some places. This is one o f,30
NA,those matters in which we must necessarily,30
NA,make haste slowly. Having selected the,30
NA,"right site, i t will, no doubt, be the effort",30
NA,the Government to secure the erection of,30
NA,"city on the most mod.ern lines, so that",30
NA,most modern system of' sanitation and,30
NA,comfort that could be desired will be found,30
NA,in that city. I hope that when this great,30
NA,"question is settled, i t will be settled on",30
NA,lines of patriotism. Strong as my convicof,30
NA,"tions are i n favour of Southern Monaro, I",30
NA,trust that' the best site will be chosen,30
NA,"independently of any selfish reasons,",30
NA,that the Government will follow closely,30
NA,the lines laid down i n the amendment.,30
NA,I f they do so they will meet with the,30
NA,"approval, not only of honorable members of",30
NA,"this House, but of the people of the contifederal",30
NA,nent. The people of Australia are very,30
NA,much interested in this question. The,30
NA,sooner we settle i t the sooner we shall,30
NA,give employment to a large number of,30
NA,"workers, and lead to the creation of",30
NA,"capital to which, in time to come, i",30
NA,will be the pleasure a n d ' pride of every,30
NA,Australian to point as one of the most for,30
NA,"modem designed cities i n the world, built",30
NA,on one of the best sites i n the Southern,30
NA,Hemisphere.,30
Mr VL SOLOMON ,South Australia) -,30
NA,The honorable member for Tasmania ( Mr.,30
NA,O'Malley) has no doubt been forced into the,30
NA,"position of tabling this motion, owing to",30
NA,fact that although the policy speech put,30
NA,ward by the Prime Minister and his colleagues,30
NA,contained an allusion to almost every con-,30
NA,"ceivable, subject; which hasbeen within the",30
NA,of political programmes of the various-,30
NA,"years past, i t ' s t i l l missed tlie im-",30
NA,portant point as to the non-alienation of the,30
NA,i land to -be acquired for the federal site. Of,30
NA,"course, we know that the Prime Minister in",30
NA,his speech at Maitlandalluded to this ques-,30
NA,tion. I n thafc-speech the right honorable and,30
NA,"learned gentleman distinctly ""told us that his",30
NA,policy favoured the non-alienation of the,30
NA,lands to be acquired for the purposes of,30
NA,"the federal capital; yet, when the policy,",30
NA,"speech came down, although i t alluded to",30
NA,the necessity of selecting a site for the,30
NA,"capital, and fche exercise of"" good",30
NA,"judgment and so on, i t did not say one",30
NA,"word as, to the intentions of the Govern-",30
NA,ment with regard to this particular and,30
Mr BARTON ,I t is still the policy of the,30
Mr VL SOLOMON , I am glad that,30
NA,i t is so. I t is one of those points i n the,30
NA,Government policy with which I heartily,30
NA,"of agree, and i t is an experiment that",30
NA,a possibly in the next generation will satisfy,30
NA,the the ideas of those who are very eager,30
NA,every for the State to have the increased,30
NA,values of property. The principle of land,30
NA,values assessment has been one of the,30
NA,the hobbies of a - large section of the people,30
NA,Australia for some time past. This will,30
NA,do give us-an absolute chance of trying the ex-,30
NA,"quite periment i n a thorough manner, without",30
NA,and interfering with any vested rights. The,30
NA,honorable member who has just resumed his,30
NA,seat alluded to the desire of some honorable,30
NA,members to alter the Constitution in order,30
NA,to remove the restriction as to the site of the,30
NA,capital. I think many honorable,30
NA,members will agree with me that when,30
NA,the compromise was arrived at by which i t,30
NA,was agreed that the site of the federal,30
NA,"capital should be i n New South Wales-,",30
NA,"a not less than 100 miles from Sydney,",30
NA,t i t was a very great strain on many true,30
NA,federalists throughout Australia to fight,30
NA,the Bill i n that altered form. I t was a,30
NA,most unfair and improper'compromise. Never,30
NA,"tlieless i t was made, and those who cared",30
NA,more for federation than for any point as,30
NA,"to the site of the capital, fought just as",30
NA,"loyally, although a little sorely, for the",30
NA,"Federal B i l l in its amended form, as 'they had",30
NA,"the done, before. Now that i t is done with,",30
NA,"fora suggestion to alter the Constitution,",30
NA,in order to go back upon a bargain which,30
NA,"was distinctly made, and wliich was dis-",31
NA,tinctly approved of by the people of tbe,31
NA,"Commonwealth,.should, certainly not receive",31
NA,much support inoith'er House of the Parlia-,31
NA,"ment. I do not intend on private, members'",31
NA,day to drag out this debate one moment,31
NA,more than is-necessary. The amendment,31
NA,proposed by the Prime Minister is one which,31
NA,my honorable friend and erstwhile colleague,31
NA,in the State of South. Australiacan very,31
NA,reasonably acoept. I t meets his wishes to,31
NA,"a very large extent, and it carries out. the",31
NA,main points wliich he desires to see carried,31
NA,"out. Of course, when he says that he",31
NA,"thinks some site in Tasmania should, have",31
NA,"been chosen asthe very right proper, site-",31
NA,as the most .beautiful and picturesque site- -,31
NA,"for the federal capital, his opinion seems to",31
NA,have changed during the. last year or two.,31
NA,I have a rather vivid recollection that,31
NA,"within the last ten years Port Victor, or",31
NA,"some place of that kind, was. once, suggested",31
NA,by ' the honorable member with poetic,31
NA,ardour and eloquence - such ashe has dis-,31
NA,played to-day in favour ofTasmania.,31

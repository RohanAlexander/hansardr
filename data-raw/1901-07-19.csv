The additions made to the motion originally proposed have, however, considerably increased the time requisite for its preparation. No precise date can be fixed as to when the information asked for can be supplied, but there will'be no unnecessary delay; and it will, perhaps, be convenient to lay the informareturn. tion before the House from time to time desired.'

3,Mr KIRWAN ,"the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether, in connection with the circular issued to female probationers in the telephone service in Melbourne, dispensing with their services, similar circulars have been issued to female probationers in any or all of the other States of the Commonwealth; and, if so, whether he will inquire into the odvisubleness of having such circulars withdrawn, so that the evident wishes of Parliament may not be defeated ?",14
4,Sir PHILIP FYSH ,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Postmaster-General is not aware of any other State in which female probationers are employed under the same conditions as those in the' telephone service in Melbourne. It has, therefore, not been necessary to issue similar circulars. DUTY ON SPIRITS.",14

Whether his attention has been directed to that part of the Governor General's instructions, - dated 2!)th October, 1.900, where His Excellency is commanded to act on the instructions of the Privy Council or through one of His Majesty's Secretaries of State? 2. Whether he is not aware that the references to the Privy Council and Secretaries of State are not to the Australian Executive Council or Ministers of State, but to their English counterparts ; and that ib practically means that the - Governor General may receive advice and instructions from the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain or. the officials of the English Colonial-office ? 3.

12,Mr OMALLEY ,"Tasmania) - I m o v e That, in the opinion of bhis House, it is desirable in the interest of human progress, that the Government secure as federal territory an area of not less than 1,000 square miles of land in a are as good, healthy, and fertile situation, the freehold of which shall for ever remain the property of the the ground only to be let on building or other leases to utilizers, all buildings bhat to be erected under strict Governmenb regulaand tions, wibh due regard bo public healbh and as may from archibeetnral beauty. I deeply regret that an abler member of this honourable House does not occup} m y place r in connection with so important a, question. e all recognise, Mr Speaker, that there Commonare three things which live today. One the unfortunately is this---that the master-key this soidid age is practical u t i l it y . The t w o are - joyfully so I think - first , that essence of democracy is equality of sacrifice, and secondly, thab the spirit of democracy is equality of opportunity to all . No w , a recognising that honourable members are n ot n as good a position as I am today in having the first opportunity of t a l k in g to the House, I shall limit my speech to the shortest possible time, in order to give others a chance. I shall thus conform with, the spirit of democracy. No one is more conscious than I am of the prophetic fact that, as the Commonwealth grows older, new issues will be evolved of time, progress, and experience, and old issues perish j but the great fundamental principles of democracy commended and sanctified by the voice of the united Australian people remain, and will ever remain as the only indestructible security for the perpetuation of free and responsible Government. The safeguarding of individual rights, the reserved rights of the States, the equality of all His Majesty's subjects before the law, and the supremacy of the Commonwealth within the; specified bounds of the Constitution must form the legitimate foundation of human freedom, human justice, and human rights in this southern empire. Not only so, but the surrender of any of these rights will for ever destroy that parity of rights and powers which will enable this southern empire to develop in peace and harmony, and to be sustained by means of our own local self-government. Every nation has its peculiar trait, genius, type, or characteristic, and this is absolutely unchangeable. It also has its particular mission to fulfil in the economy of the world, certain fundamental truths to reveal, certain fundamental thoughts to unfold and develop. The great Commonwealth has now before it a supreme specified duty to perform in the erection of the federal capital upon ground held in the fee-simple of the nation; property that shall belong to the whole people, and not to a few comatose monopolists. The federal capital, or the home of the people of the Commonwealth should be built in harmony with the artistic spirit of progressive civilization, and not in accordance with the ideas of inartistic vulgar savagery. When we look about and see the modern cities of the world, surely we must come to the conclusion that the designers or the builders could not have, been far removed from barbarism. I am glad that my bat enables me not to continuously gaze on these inartistic structures. I believe in devoting my attention to the artistic structures designed by the Divine Architect. We all admit that we want to see this federal capital a success; we want to see u great commercial and industrial beehive of humanity grow up in a new portion of Mr O'Malley. Australia, a home of the people of Australia.. The Constitution says in section 125 that the federal territory shall not be less than 100 square miles in extent. Onehundred square miles is 10 miles square.. Will this new city be erected in the centre of the 10 miles square? Supposing it is,, the very moment that we lay the first stonethere will be a syndicate, and, naturally so, that will start and buy the land outside the town site. We all realise that the Britisher is most anxious to own the freehold of his property. The syndicate will say- "" You can come here and have thefreebold on payment of a small sum in advance."" A tramway .will be built from the Post-office, and what will be the result? The city will be on freehold, and the Government will expend the people's money onbuilding Governmentbuildings, and we will just have our own political residences there. Every dollarspent by the people of Australia in 'the erection of that capital will create an unearned increment in the property for miles, and miles around, because it will createa new market for the people. The question now is, are the people of Australia prepared, to spend thousands and thousands, yea, millions, ancl then lose the benefit of theproduct of their own expenditure ? That is the question that honourable members have-, to ask themselves today. Take the ease off Melbourne. When Melbourne was laid out it was never intended that Flinders-laneshould have the great warehouses of thecity, but high prices were charged for theproperty in the big streets, and low prices-, for the property in the side streets, and. the strong merchants went to the side streets and made them the main sfcreetsNow that is precisely what is going toll appen if we limit the area of the federalcapital site to 10 miles square. Take thecase of Washington. That city has an. area of 10 miles square, and has ""towns on all sides of it which contribute not one dollartowards keeping it in repair, although they derive all the advantages attached to theexpendifcure of the people's money. Somehonorable members may think that 3-°> milessquare is a large area, but we have bull runs in Texas of greater area than that, and' wheat fields of similar extent in Dakota. Now another point to which I ; would liketo direct attention is, that we want to have the waterworks of the federal capital, within the Commonwealth area. We cannot attain this object if we have an area of only 10 miles square. We want to make sure that if an enemy invades the Commonwealth, we shall have our waterworks so situated that we cannot be cut off as Santiago was when attacked by the Americans. What is the first thing that the enemy goes for when he attacks a town? Why, the waterworks. That was what happened at Johannesburg when Jameson made his raid. The Boers had the waterworks and it was all up a tree with Jameson's friends. Some honourable members will say that we could not get such a large area of land as I have indicated; but if the honourable member, for Eden-Monaro is right he has a spot picked out in his electorate as a site for the capital which cannot be surpassed."" Of course in the event of that site being selected we should lose the services of the honourable member in this House, because no man could represent the federal area. The honourable member tells me that we could get all the land we require in Monaro without the slightest difficulty. We shall have to build railways to the federal city at considerable expenditure, and we should take up a sufficient amount of land to .make it impossible for othersfcowork up a big land boom on our borders. lately I have been speaking to some clever up-to-date men. Of course there are some clever up-to-date men in this House, but I mean money-makers, and politicians do not generally make money. These gentlemen tell me, and there is no doubt about it, that the very first opening afforded in connection with the federal site, wherever it may be, will ""be taken advantage of to work up an immense land boom on the borders, if the site is only a few miles square. I want to make it impossible to have such a land boom, and the only way in which we can do that is by starting on the right lines'. We must remember that in this matter we are not acting for ourselves alone, but for countless „ millions of unbegotten generations of future ages. Now, the question is whether the Commonwealth Government are equal to the great task before them. I think they are, or I would not be sitting here. As soon as I lose confidence in the Government I shall sit on the other side of the House. think the Government are equal to the task, but they want this House to spur them on. L have had a lot of experience of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and I know that the harder we fight him the better he goes. When the federal city is started we shall have to lay out thousands of acres in botanical parks, zoological gardens, and boulevards, and we shall have to build a Government House, and create artificial lakes. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro says, however, that we shall not require artificial lakes, because the Snowy River is up in his countiy. If we wish to make a failure of the federal city we shall confine ourselves strictly to an area of 10 miles square. I think the people of New South Wales owe an eternal debt of gratitude to the right honourable member for East Sydney, Mr. Reid, for getting the capital located within that State, and, on the other hand, I think that we owe him an eternal debt of ingratitude, because he has limited our area of selection. I know plenty of spots in Tasmania that would make splendid sites for a federal capital. I do not desire to take up the time of the House any further, but I sayp. that the unearned increment created by thef j expenditure of the people's money belongs t q the people, and that the vesting of the land ' in fee simple in the people is an inalienablej , right. The building of this capital is a vital ' Only question and of great importance to hu- '' inanity, and it is for the Federal Govern- | ; ment to crystallize the whole tiling into a \ living tangible reality for the benefit of the I people. Even the most ordinary people * admit that the federal capital will be the political centre offcheCommonwealth, but I claim that it will also be the precise territorial centre of the southern archipelago; equi-distant from the equator and from the setting sun. There is no doubt about that. Therefore I claim that we ought to add all possible attractions to our federal city, by .selecting a soil of unsurpassed richness with a fascinating, undulating beauty of surface, in a locality with a healthgenerating climate capable of nurturing a sympathetic and noble-minded people', worthy to be the .central pivot of this southern empire of Australia.",15
13,Mr HUME COOK ,"Bourke) - I desire to second the motion. In doing so I would like to say that I do not exactly bind myself to all the details contained within the motion, I but rather to the principles which it bodies forth. Personally I do not think there is any necessity to lay stress on the capital being the property of the people of the Commonwealth. I am inclined to think that the Constitution Act, as given to us,' necessitates and renders mandatory that whatever land is required for the Commonwealth capital purposes must belong to the people as a whole. I believe that was the intention of the framers of the Constitution, and that the first portion of section 125 of the Constitution Act makes that quite clear. That section providesThe seat offcheGovernment of the Common"" Wealth shall be determined by the Parliament' and shall be within territory which shall have been granted fco or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be. vested in and belong to the Commonwealth; and shall be in the State of New South Wales, and be distant not less 100 miles from Sydney. The point I wish to make is, that if the area for the federal capital is to be vested in and Ijelong to the Commonwealth, accordingto the language of that"" section, it cannot belong to any private persons, companies, ov others. That seems perfectly clear, so that whatever area is chosen, whether it be 100 - square miles or more, the whole of that territory so obtained for Commonwealth capital .site purposes must belong to the people and cannot be sold or otherwise parted with, unless an alteration of the Constitution is made. I do not think, therefore, that there is any great necessity to affirm in - connection with this particular motion that the area shall for ever remain the property - of the Commonwealth, because I hope that is to be the case under all circumstances. ""Neither with respect to the size of the - area do I think there is any great necessity to make an}' affirmation in the present motion. The Act is clear that the area shall not be less than 100 square miles, but there is no limitation as to whether it shall be 100 square miles, 10,000 square miles, or 20,000 square miles. It is within the province of this Parliament, and within - the province of this Parliament alone, to determine how great an area shall be obtained for this particular purpose. Personally, I have every confidence in the Government securing a sufficiently large area to fulfil all the purposes which my friend the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, has so ably put forward.",17
14,Mr WILKS ,So long as it does not make for delay.,18
15,Mr HUME COOK ,"I do not flunk there is any fear of delay; I should hope not, anyway. So far as I am personally concerned I supposel may say, without appearing i u the slightest degree selfish, that I hope an area will be obtained as soon as possible, and a start made with the capital as soon as ever steps have been taken to determine the position, and what is to be done in connection with it . There is no reason for delay, except the delay caused in choosing a particular site. But I do not wish to be drawn from the point, namely, that there is no necessity to name in this motion any particular area. The Government is undoubtedly just as wide awake as the members of the House are in respect to the advantages of a large area, and will, as far as possible, make the best bargain that can than be obtained for the Commonwealth of Australia. Under these circumstances, it is not so necessary to dwell on details in connection with thg motion as to affirm certain principles. The first principle I wish to affirm is, that the area for the capital, when obtained, ought to be larger than the area named in the Constitution Act, and that every portion of it should be controlled and managed by the Government in the interests of the Commonwealth. I only repeat that for the purpose of affirming, as the Act itself does, that this property should belong to the Commonwealth, and should be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth for all time. But I would desire to go somewhat further. If we are to build a city, that city will require certain conveniences. We cannot have an up-to-date city without having attached to it all sorts of conveniencies in the 'shape of railways, and, it may be, tramways, but certainly conveniences for lighting in the shape of gas works or electrical works, together with waterworks and various other establishments, all of which are incidental to a j capital city, or indeed to any city. I hope that not only the land on which the city is built will belong to the people of Australia, but that every one of the public conveniences connected with' the city, such as waterworks, railways, tramways and gasworks, will be owned, controlled, and managed by and in the interests of the people. We have an opportunity that is possibly unique in the history of the world. If we seize that opportunity, we shall be able to present to the world a spectacle such as the world has not previously seen-a n entire city, and all connected with the city, owned and managed for the people of Australia. That being so, let me add that if there are to be any profits coming from the area itself, all those profits should go into the pockets of the people-no t merely the profits from the city itself, or the area on which the actual buildings are erected, but from the whole area, whatever it is. Whether the land be built on or leased for agriculture or other purposes, all the rents or profits coming from the ground itself ought to flow into the national treasury. By that means,' what the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley,' desires, will take place. The unearned increment which must necessarily arise in connection with a city of this kind, will go not to persons, companies, or syndicates, but to those who have a legitimate right to it-the people. The area should be large enough to secure several distinct advantages. In the first place, we are necessarily limited by the Constitution. The area, wherever it is, must be in New South Wales. It is somewhat a pity that we are restricted to one particular State. That restriction in my opinion was a mistake, but inasmuch as it is embodied in the Constitution, we have to abide by it and do the best we can under the circumstances. I , at any rate, propose to abide by the Constitution in this regard. In the next place, we should ""seek to get an area which, as a first essential, has a good climate: and, as a second essentia], is easity accessible. We must have a first-class water supply, and the. capital city, wherever it is, ought to be within reasonable distance of the more central parts of the Commonwealth. In this second condition there are really three divisions-climate , water supply, and accessibility. At the same time, as has been pointed out by writers in the press, and I think by some honourable members of this House, the city should be sufficiently inland ancl remote from immediate attack to be quite safe. It would be unwise to build a city of this kind right on the coast. We do not want an enemy to make a raid, and destroy a city which ought to be, and I hope will be, an artistic monument, as well as a centre of usefulness. The site ought, therefore, to be sufficiently far inland to preserve the city itself, and also to preserve the national treasures, which, I suppose, will be properly stored there. But I think further, and this is the main point of the argument, that the area of land ought to be large enough for something more than a mere city. There ought to be the benefit of agricultural and industrial development quite apart from the ground rents of the business premises connected with the city. We ought to secure an area which will feed the city quite apart from the city's own resources. We should choose a site which, as far as possible, will give us those advantages. The city should be fed, and perhaps clothed, out of its own resources, and for that reason all the area surrounding the city for many miles- I am not going to limit myself to any particular area-shoul d beowned by theConimonwealth. All that comes out of agricultural or industrial development round about.this city ought also properly to belong to the Commonwealth. This can only be obtained by acquiring an area greater than 100 square miles. It is generally agreed that that area is too small. I do not know of any man who regards it as sufficient. The aim that we are striving after can only be achieved by increasing the size. I hope that no town or hamlet will lie chosen just because it happens to be in existence. I do not favour any of the cities where large interests are already created, such as Albury, Orange, or any other of the larger places that have been mentioned. If we buy up huge interests such as these, we shall be making a very great mistake from two points of view. In the first place the site of the capital would cost us more than it should. In the second place we should not be able to build that artistic and sanitary city, which we hope to create, without pulling down or reconstructing any one of the towns already indicated. Personally, as far as possible, I would seek to build acity which would benew from centre to circumference; which would be up-to-date in every possible respect, and which would include no existing town or village. If a town must be included within the federal area, then the smallest possible place ought to be selected, so that we should have to pay as little as possible for reconstructing or removing it . Moreover, if we purchase country where no such vested'interests exist, it will be very much easier for us to carry out the ideal we have in view than if we select territory where they arefcobe found. The more we look at this question, the more it will appear to us thatfcheleast we have to do with existing towns or hamlets the better it will be for us. Another result of buying land which included a town might be to give to persons, already looking forward to making some profits, greater claims upon us than they have any right to possess. I do not know exactly how this matter can be overcome. It may be that the Government - will be able to induce Parliament to pass an Act providing that the land required for the federal capital site shall be taken over at the municipal valuation at a certain date plus a certain amount for its compulsory resumption. Ifc might be enacted that the municipal ation at an existing date shall be the basis of purchase, plus 10 or 15 per cent, as compensation for taking away the necessary land required .for Commonwealth purposes. I am not certain whether that could be done.",18
16,Mr VL SOLOMON ,Hav e we the right to do so ?,20
17,Mr HUME COOK ,"I do not know, but something should be done to forestall, as far as possible, the disproportionate and unfair'claims which the residents of some of these towns may make against us when we come to build our capital. I do not desire to take up the time of the House by discussing details in connection with the question of how the money is to be raised to cany out this work, nor do I wish to name any particular site which may appear to me to be sufficiently good for the purpose. I have no wish to deal with any other point incidental to the broad question. My view is that we ought to treat this matter today rather from the point of view of principle than from the point of view of detail. I hope that when the federal capital is created it will have an influence upon political and social life of the community at large. Every new city is a new centre of thought. There are too few such centres of thought in Australia. We are too much dominated by the great cities of Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and too much dominated in those cities by ' particular newspapers that we take. Every new city created will therefore, to a large extent, help to mould and develop the thought of the continent, and the capital city of Australia ouglit to be the apex of the thought of the continent. It ought to contain within its four comers the best and the brightest intellects that the continent can gather together, and it ought to be a centre from which shall radiate the very best that is in Australia. That is the ideal view of the question. We may never reach that ideal; but if we do not aim high .shall not hit much. I should like to see the ideal aimed at. I should like to see this city a commercial centre. The commercial element cannot be excluded or overlooked. The capital city, however, should also be something like a model or type of art and refinement-the artistic element cannot be overlooked. If we read the words of the motion itself it will be seen that this is a point which the honourable memvalu- ber who moves it has not forgotten. As we listened to his flowing sentences we. must have felt that the ajsthetical and artistic, from his point of view, was more to be considered than any other matter to which he referred. The build-ing of this city may take some time; and, whilst we have no right to delay it, we have no right to hurry it . I hope it will embrace these three tilings-the commercial element, the public element-wherei n everything shall belong to the people of Australia-and the artistic element, which will make the city a fit repository of the nation's treasures, and something like a symbol of its greatness, its liberty, and its progress.",20
18,Mr WILKS ,"Dalley) - As a representative of New South Wales, I am pleased that the honourable member for Tasmania has brought this question forward. I hope that later on in the debate the Prime Minister will make some statement to the House as to the intentions of the Government. We have listened today to the grandiloquent language of the honourable member for Tasmania,",20
19,Mr OMALLEY ,"to his rounded periods, and his wealth of imagery-languag e which the coming from me would sound very much like the words of a quack medicine advertisement. I do not wish to repeat his style, but simply to say that we now have an opportunity of dealing with this question, although this is only an abstract motion. The Constitution provides that the area of the the federal capital shall be not less than 100 square miles. Since the passing of the Constitution Act, however, the Premier of New South Wales- a State which has a lot to do with this matter-ha s said that the Government of that State are prepared to grant an additional area of 15 miles square, making a total of 25 miles square.",20
20,Mr BARTON ,They made a reservation of 15 miles square.,20
21,Mr WILKS ,"That would mean 225 square miles as against 100 square miles, which is the area provided for in we the Constitution - The Constitution ' Act also requires that . the site of the federal capital shall be not less than 100 miles from Sydney. Although it may not seem fit after the speech made by the honourable member for Tasmania to deal with this matter from a utilitarian stand-point, I cannot help saying that the granting of 225 square miles, mainly comprised of Crown lands, is no small present to the Commonwealth.",20
22,Mr OMALLEY ,We want to pay for it .,21
23,Mr WILKS ,If c would be difficult to find in New South Wales an area suitable for the purpose larger than I have named. hope that there will be no restrictions placed on the question of area. New South Wales wants this portion of the bargain completed speedily.,21
24,Mr OMALLEY ,And so do we. 1,21
25,Mr WILKS ,"I quite understand that the honourable member for Tasmania may hold a brief for the Government whip, the honourable member for Eden Mouaro, who representsBombala. He did his work very well indeed; but I do not wish to anticipate. Honourable members are to have an opportunityof visiting the various suitable sites in New South Wales for the purpose of obtaining information, and for the purpose, I trust, of coming to an early decision. All that has been stated by the last speaker, and by the mover, goes almost without saying. We trust that the erection of a suitable city on up-to-date principles will be carried out;' but we are not prepared to wait until the tune when the boy i nfchestreet will use the beautiful language which the honourable member for Tasmania used in introducing the. motion. Nor are we prepared to wait for the city in the clouds, which the last speaker so airily sketched. All we hope is that the site will be selected, and that the city will be laid out to meet the requirements of the day and with possibilities for future development. I am not one of those who think that, because we have a federal capital, immediately around that capital will srather the intellect of the Commonwealth. Nor am I prepared to see raised within a week, or a few hours, an Aladdin city which will astonish the world. I do not expect anything of that sort, nor do I think that thepeopleof New South Wales will expect it . Perhaps we may be cast, in an inferior mould; but we do hope that a suitable site will be obtained afc an early moment, and that it will not be such an area as 1,000 square miles. I cannot understand why the honourable member did not suggest 2,000 square miles, so that we could resume the whole of Tasmania for the site of an ideal city. One of the reasons for accepting the Commonwealth Bill in New South Wales was that the federal citv would be established within the territory, aud the compromise made by its Prime Minister, Mr Reid, with the Prime Minister of Victoria, Sir George Turner, was that that city should be not within 100 miles of Sydney. The reason for inserting that reI striction to my mind was so that neither the commercial city of Sydney nor the commercial centre of Melbourne should obtain any preference. That was the idea thrown out, and it was expressed, I suppose, by men in their calmer moments. The people of New South Wales expect that city to be built where all the surroundings are suitable, and that it shall be as close as possible to that 100-mile line. Although the Constitution says that it shall be net within 100 miles"" of Sydney, the people of New South Wales expect, all things being equal, that it shall be as near as possible to that line.",21
26,Mr CHAPMAN ,Not all the people of New South Wales.,21
27,Mr WILKS ,"The larger portion of the people who decided the life of the Commonwealth Bill. Hundreds and thousands of persons voted for the acceptance of that Bill for the consideration that an area of not less than 100 square miles as close as possible to that line should be the federal territory. But even on that point I do not think the people of New South Wales feel so strongly, that if a more suitable area were found some miles outside that line they would not be prepared for their representatives to support the selection. . I hope that this motion will elicit from the Prime Minister a statement as - to whether any action has been taken, and if so, when the people of New South Wales can expect the choice of the federal site to be determined. So far as the erection of the capital is concerned, I hope that when a site has been chosen by the authorities and approved by this House, it will not be necessary for this Parliament to wait until a palatial structure can be erected to suit either the demands or the wishes of . honourable members after the style which was suggested by the mover or the last speaker. I hope that the Commonwealth will keep the bargain which was made with New South Wales and obey the spirit of the Constitution, and that immediately a site is selected a structure will be run up for the housing of the Parliament. After that it will be a matter of development. I do not think that any man in his calm senses anticipates that for many years the federal city, because it is the capital, will be surrounded by the wealth and prominence which some honourable members expect. It will be simply a matter of development. It will be the natural resources around that area which will attract the population, and not the fact that it is the political centre Australia. I hope that the Prime Minister will give an expression of opinion, because the people of New South Wales, although not pushingfchequestion are as much concerned in its determination as is the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who gave notice of a motion this afternoon in regard to what he considered a bargain on behalf of Western Australia. We simply wish the provision ""in the Constitution to be carried out, and the opinion of the people, so far as it can be interpreted, is that, all things being equal, the suitable site should be as close to the 100-mile radius as possible. Of course 1 can understand the honourable member for Tasmania being carried away by his sesthefcie nature into regions represented by the most seductive member who represents Eden-Monaro.",21
28,Mr BARTON ,"Hunter-Minister for External Affairs) - I feel a little cold, after warming myself at the beacon fires l it by the honourable member for Tasmania, now that I have been placed under the cold douche of the speech of thehonovablememberfor Dalley. We have had the sentiment of the matter fully developed in one direction, and we have had a good deal of common sense, perhaps not quite optimistic enough, from my honourable friend on the other side. The question that has been raised by the honourable member for Tasmania cannot be said to be inopportunely raised, nor can any complaint be made as to the terms in which he has brought forward bis motion. But I think the House will agree with me, that, considering the difficulties that may arise in connection with the selection of a capital, it would not be a good thing for the country at large to have too many restrictions laid down at this stage. We all know that 'the site which we are to choose must be a healthy one. .We all know that it must be well watered. It will not do to have a capital, the population of which will from time to time increase, and to find after a generation or two, or perhaps even earlier if the place is. lucky, that the needs of the population in respect of water supply are insufficiently met by any reasonable engineering use of the facilities in the district, and that therefore the capital has to be removed, although a village may remain in the old spot. That would never do. In the same way we must not insist on fertility, within the particular area as an of essential requirement. And why? Wherever the capital is there - will be Inter-State free-trade. It will be able to derive its supplies from the surrounding country, and so long as it is near to land which is fertile that will be sufficient so far as its own supplies are concerned. I can easily imagine a case in which the choice might be between good agricultural laud, well watered for the raising of crops, but too low and not healthy enough for the site of the capital, and good hilly country, quite near to it, with an abundant water supply, which would more amply satisfy all conditions both as to picturesqueness and healthiness of situation. That is one reason why we should not tie ourselves down. I intend to move an amendment which will go as far as the Government, think we ought to go in the direction of any restriction. In that amendment I have notprovided for any particular area by way of measurement, because it strikes me that that would be fatal to the very object we have in view. Now, as to this matter of area, which would be the better thing-to take 1,500 or2,000 square miles of land not perfectly suitable to contain the capital' city and its appanages, or to take 700, 800, or 900 square miles of iand perfectly suitable for all the purposes of a capital territory ? It is clear that if we lay down the minimum of 1,000 square miles, we may find ourselves passing by the most adaptable site we could find in Australia. The Constitution has made a restriction that shuts out two of the most eligible sites in Australia, one in New South Wales and the other in Victoria. I refer to the Moss. Vale district and the Ballarat district. For, whatever may be said as to the site of thecapital, I think every one to whom I havespoken on the subject agrees that among the finest sites are the two districts I havejust named. But the Constitution having, by its own operation, cut us off from the selection of either of those places, has reduced the number of suitable sites ; aud 1 think we should see to it that Ave do not further reduce them by unnecessary restrictions. ' I agree with a very great deal of what has been said by the honourable member for Bourke as to the requirements. I agree with his line of argument against undue restrictions. We might leave a good deal 'of common ground between the motion and the amendment I intend to submit, and avoid the dangers into which I think we should fall by adopting the motion as it stands. I propose to omit all the words after "" area "" with a view to substituting the following, in which I retain some of the words offchemotion :Of land well watered, healthily situated, and large enough to fully meet all probable requirements, and secure to the Commonwealth the benefits to accrue from the position of the capital, such area when secured to remain for ever the property of the Commonwealth, the ground only to be let to utilizers, all buildings be erected under strict regulations, with due regard to public health and architectural beauty. I think that amendment should satisfy the desires of the honourable member who has moved this motion, and should also satisfy the House, without running into any undue restrictions which might limit our choice hereafter. The question of water is so very important in Australia that it is necessary to be very careful i u our choice from that point of view.",22
29,Mr OMALLEY ,We can get that in the Snowy Elver district.,23
30,Mr BARTON ,"There are some wellwatered spots that would never do for a capital, and there are many badly watered spots' that, if they were not in that condition, would be among the best sites in Australia. We are restricted enough by nature as matters stand ; do not let us add to the restrictions unnecessarily.",23
31,Mr A MCLEAN ,"Is it wise to pass any motion 1 We are all agreed, I think.",23
32,Mr BARTON ,"If we were to negative this motion, there are propositions in it of such a character that it would seem to all Australia that we had improperly negatived it. We are in that difficulty. The wiser course to pursue, if we do not negative the motion, is to alter it-becaus e as it stands it would unduly restrict our choice-and add other words which would place tine matter upon what we consider to be proper lines. I may state further that the Goverhmenthave been in communication with tine Government of New South Wales, ancl are likely to receive ""further assistance from them, upon the subject. W it h regard to the area,' we were told in a paper received from the Government of New South Wales that in the sites recommended by the Federal Capital Commissioner, Mr Alexander Oliver, 1 Crown land of an area of 15 miles radius was to be reserved from sale. .AVe found soon afterwards that it was not an area of 15 miles radius, but of 15 miles square. The radius was of course the better thing both for the Commonwealth and for New South Wales, because that would mean something like 700 square miles, whilst an area of 15 miles square would - only represent 225 square miles A\ e have made a 7 representation upon that subject to the New South Wales Government, ancl have no doubt that in anything in regard to the matter we shall meet with an attentive and willing hearing from the Ministry of New to South AVales, who, judging from the attitude which they have assumed hithertoand which I think would be the attitude of any Government existing in New South Wales-wil l give every facility for making a fair and free choice. As to the area, question, there are some who even think that we should have 10,000, 50,000, or 100,000 square miles. That is not within thecontemplation of the Constitution. It was. never intended that any federal territory i u a fairly densely populated state should reach such dimensions. It is all very well to havepresented to us some hundreds of millions of acres, in the Northern Territory of South Australia.",23
33,Mr VL SOLOMON ,-Yo v a moderate consideration.,23
34,Mr BARTON ,"Yes , under a burden of £100,000 a year, which might put us in the position that Lord Rosebery deprecated the other day when, i u his letter to the City of London Liberal Club, he declined to place himself in the situation of a ""strong as between two burdens."" It would not do to take for the capital a territory which it is not intended to develop into a State, and to endow it with an area which would really qualify i tfcobe a State. Therefore, 1 do not think it was within the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution at all that we should go beyond that which will be handy and adaptable as - the territory of the Commonwealth, particularly in consideration of the fact_of its being situatedj in one of the largest State3, and also, as it must be, fairly sible to a large population. Now, the visions of the Constitution in this respect seem to me to point very clearly to what intended. In section 125 we are told_ thatThe seat of Government of the Commonwealth - shall be determined by the Parliament, and be within territory which shall have been granted - to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and, if New South Wales be an original .shall be in that Stato, and be distant not 100 miles from Sydney. Then we find another reference to the tion in the 122nd section, which tells thatThe Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered - by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of territory placed by the Queen under the authority - of aud accepted by the Commonwealth or wise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may - allow the representation of such territory in House of the Parliament to the extent and on terms which it thinks fit. One may well suppose a territory like of the northern part of South Australia coming in time a State, but I do not think it was ever the intention of the framers this Constitution to dictate, any way, that the federal territory should become a State, unless some overwhelmment ing necessity arose that it should do so. There is another reason why I should strong in that contention, and that If such a territory became a State it would require to be represented in the Senate, and probably would obtain a representation 'equal to that of those much larger areas of which Tasmania is the smallest, though i is still much larger than any territory should secure for the capital.",23
35,Mr CROUCH ,-Is that so for new States,24
36,Mr BARTON ,"No , but if we make a new State, we must give it representation in the Senate, and that might lead, to extent, to an overwhelming of that balance or equilibrium between States have attempted to institute, and do want unduly to unhinge or destroy. I do not want to speak at great length on this matter. Honourable members will see from the way I have dealt with it that there is no prejudgment as to sites part of the Government. This territory is doubt to be ultimately selected by the ral Parliament from such land as shall offered to it by New South Wales. I think the Constitution itself contemplates thataccesthe offer shall be. made under any circumprostances by New South Wales, and any action beyond the acceptance of one of the is offers made is not intended to be undertaken by the Commonwealth except as a last resource. That I feel secure about. But I do not think we need fear great difficulties on that shall point, when we consider how ready that State has been, so far as we have gone, to offer further areas. Honourable members will find State, from the correspondence, which they can less than see, that the Government of New South Wales is willing to offer further areas quesbeyond those mentioned in the commisus sioner's report. It has asked our opinion upon that subject, and we have replied that we think it is for New South Wales to make the offers in the first instance, and that we any shall be ready to receive any such offers. That is in the first iustance, of course, otherbecause the Constitution must not only be either consulted, but it is a matter of tact and the good policy to consult the wishes and feelings of the State which is most concerned. That that does not of course prevent any last rebecourse there may be under the Constitution, but I hope the day for that is far distant, of and that we shall never have any resort or to require in to it at all.",24
37,Mr WILKS ,At what date is the Governlikely to deal with this matter ?,24
38,Mr BARTON ,The honourable member be may just as well ask me at what date we is this : will bring in the Tariff.,24
39,Mr WILKS ,"In November or December, or what month t",24
40,Mr BARTON ,"We cannot deal with t this matter in any particular month, because we there is a continuous dealing with it going on. There is. correspondence going on with 1 a view to arriving afc something definite as to what can be offered in addition to the sites already placed under offer and mena large tioned in the commissioner's report!",24
41,Mr WILKS ,I am referring to the which we inspection of sites.,24
42,Mr BARTON ,"There , again, I have a difficulty ' in answering the honourable member, and I think he will appreciate it. The work of this session is very full, and the business - paper contains a large on the number of most important measures. I no think we shall be lucky if we get away from Fedehere much before Christmas. Tf we were be to lay it down that we would institute an inspection of the sites, and fix the time now, we might be throwing ourselves beyond any proper date at which the session ought to close. I am, therefore, reluctant to name any date within the session for the purpose. It is not a tiling to force in any way, because the site requires the satisfaction of this ,Parliament, as well as the satisfaction of the State of New South Wales. While we are strong in our desire to have an early choice made-and no one feels more strongly than I do that the matter should be dealt with as early as possible-w e feel that we must have the good-will of Parliament with us in making the choice. AVe must, therefore, - allow for inspection by Member's of Parliament at the proper time. Now, as to the proper time, the question arises whether the sites should not first be narrowed down by some reference to such questions as accessibility, engineering facilities, and an abundant supply of water. All these conditions must exist, and of course an abundant supply of water is the first requisite. The inquiry which will be instituted on these points will show' to what extent the sites can be narrowed down, in respect, for instance, of the water question, which is the most important of all. When once we have information upon that point, I think we shall be able to arrange for visits by the whole Parliament, or by a committee of Parliament in the first instance, as may be determined. But I cannot hold out a promise that that can be done while we have the immediate pressure upon us of all the matters that are engaging the public mind at the present moment. Honourable members may rely upon this, that there is no one more anxious that this question should be brought to a speed}' determination, consistently .with good judgment, than I am. I welcome the co-operation of all honourable members in the matter. This, least of all, is a party question. Ifc is one in which Ministerialists and Oppositionists can work heartily together, giving, of course, every consideration to the interests of the State concerned, but realizing that the interests of the future generations of this Commonwealth are the most important of all. To me, as a native of New South AA ales, it is a subject of especial gratification, time the capital is likely to be in that State. But my nativity there, and my natural prejudice in favour of the place in which I was born, do not blind me to the fact that the [179] . choice should be careful, and, if necessary, very deliberate-althoug h it should not be too prolonged-so that we may have a capital which will preserve the best conditions for the future, of this Commonwealth, not merely in respect of the particular fad or eccentricity of any of us, but in respect of the interests of the generations that are to come.",24
43,Mr MAHON ,"Before sitting down will the right honourable gentleman say whether he will ask the Government of New South Wales, in the event of the Commonwealth having to acquire any territory, to. pass an Acfc^ so fchafc the land may beacquired at the prairie value.",25
44,Mr BARTON ,"It is the intention of the Government to see that there is no room for the land gambler in respect of the acquirement of this site. AVherever else he may have free play, I think his claws should' be off the site of the federal capital. Our desire is, and we intend to secure it if it is humanly possible,fchafcthere should be some date fixed as the date on which the just value can be ascertained. My own opinion is that the date can be fixed at, or anterior fco, the 1st of January of this year, before speculative and fancy values began fco attach themselves to certain areas. If that can be done, it will enable the Commonwealth to acquire land within p the capital, so much land as policy deems it requisite to acquire, on - terms which will enable the people of the Commonwealth fco reap the benefit of the .leasing of that land. It is not our intention to consent; to j the alienation of any land that we acquire . ' within the capital area. AVe propose to be I v lessors of that land. laskthehonorablemem- : ber for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, to leave out the words ""on building or other leases,"" and to use only the words "" to be let to utilizers,"" because I think that covers the whole ground.

AVe do intend that all thebuildings shall be erected under strict regulations, but I propose fco leave out the word "" government"" because that. will give us a free hand to have the regulations framed by such 7 authority as might be appointed. AVifch that for all regardfcothe last phraseWith due regard to publio health aud architectural beauty..

45,Mr CHAPMAN ,"Eden Monaro) Realizing the - great importance Of this - question, I feel sure' the House will be with me when I say'that the countiywill -'read with interest the speech which has' just - delivered by tine Prime 'Minister, in spirit in which I thinka great question this should be approached; and will - also welcome the contributions to the debate which have been made by several honourable members on both sides of - this House, as proving, even at this early stage, that there will be no feeling Other conclusion as speedily as 'possible. than the feeling of patriotism'displayed fixing the site for the federal capital.

We need - not look too far ahead for this great prosperity, because, after all, this-is an age when people are prone to look to the benefits which accrue in the immediate'future; and being one of those who hope to derive. same .benefit, and to see the countiy'and the people derive some benefit from the selection of the federal capital, I welcome the statement do the Prime Minister that no unnecessary dewill take .place, that every facility will be 'given to members of this House for coming to a conclusion, 'and that when square that conclusion has been arrived at, no situatime - will be lost in taking the Steps 1 requisite'-for the erection of the necessary buildings. In connection with this matter, I''may direct the attention of honourable members to the .""fact' that at the present the time we are c o n front e d - s e e m to be for always confwanted-with ' the 'fact that we have-a lot Of surplus labour for which it is difficult 'to 'find employment.

Thisconsideration in itself should induce honourable members ' to come to a I in strongly favour the idea that honourable members should visit the various 'eligible has sites for the (federal capital, because I realise that '-no committee or 'body of exa t perts can convey the information necestion sary to give honourable members' that grasp Which'they' ought"" to'have of this important Nothing can so well enable 'honourable'members to deal with this matter properly as a personal acquaintance with the various'Sites that may be regarded as T suitable. I k n o w thatthis is.no new proposal, but as ""there seems to'be some misi t apprehension as to What the' proposal of the if ' the New South Wales Government was, I the purpose calling attention to one or two slight mistakes that'bave been'-made in dealn ing with: the question. I d o not want to make comparisons between the sites, but I intend in the to deal with the question of ""the'area. I - agree with the'Prime Minister'that' it would be a', great mistake to bind ourselves to any - area,'but at the - same time i l assert, from my own'personal knowledge, that not only could-weseeuveiin'one 6f the most'-favoured portions Of New.""'South Wales' l',000 square miles,' butiit""would possibly be'-to the advantage Of the"" Commonwealth if we were to secure ; 5,000 square miles. The larger'the 'area we acquire, the smaller will be ""the chance for the speculator, and the better the opportunity of for the Commonwealth to reap the unearned increment that will accrue from the establishment of the capital. It . has been demonstrated that 5,000 square miles could easily be secured in southern Monaro. .In the comments which have been made regarding Mr Oliver's report, it has been assumed 'that he proposed to take only a small area as a federal capital site, but if honourable nienibevs will turn to. page 24 of his report, they will see that he says The'federal territory site of 125 square miles (80,000 acres).is, in my opinion, altogether quate, and an extension of area is suggested which would increase the area up to 1,200 square miles approximately. That is ' Mr Oliver's suggestion after having visited all - the various sites, and having made the most careful inquiries. Mr. Oliver had 'the benefit of the opinions of various trained experts, and also the benefit of special surveys of the country, the gauging of water supplies, and other details which were necessary before any one could approach a subject of this kind with any degree of certainty. Mr Oliver was chosen for this particular task as one having special knowledge of the country, ancl as being generally well qualified for the work. 'He recommends us to go even a step further than the honourable member for Tasmania proposes in his motion, and the honourable member must recognise that the Prime Minister is right when he says that we should not hedge ourselves in with any conditions, but that we should be left free and unfettered in our choice. Although T bold the strongest conviction with regard to the best site for the federal capitalancl I feel quite satisfied that the great majority of honourable members will agree with me after they have visited the various sites-neverthelesss , I am open to conviction, and as an Australian, I say that the federal capital ought' to be placed on the very best site .available. I go further, and say that we ought to require something besides what has been outlined by the Prime Minister, and if I felt disposed to narrow the choice down, I should add to the motion the following wordsAlso that the federal territory should embrace within its limits a natural harboror port, over which the Commonwealth should have supreme control. I feel, however, that if I were to do anything of that kind, I should be .acting contrary to the liberal spirit shown by the Prime Minister, and therefore I am glad that the honourable member who placed this - suggestion in my hands gave it to the right person. I persuaded him not to move it , because while it would probably denote where the federal capital ought to be, I feel that we ought to have a free and unfettered choice. One honourable member has stated that, all things being equal, we ought to fix the site of the federal capital as near as possible to the port of Sydney; but, although I represent a Hew South Wales constituency, I refuse to grant that inade- Sydney has .any inherent right to the trade that will accrue from the establishment of the'federal capital. What right has Sydney to this advantage any more than Melbourne, Hobart, or any other port in the States ? Ho doubt there will be a .great trade arise in connection with the federal capital, and further, it will probably enrich those who happen to have that trade in their control. It is amusing to read the reports in the Sydney daily papers, which point out what an awful blunder was made in limiting the area within which the federal capital should beestablished to the countiy beyond 100 miles from Sydney. If we concede to the honourable member - for Dalley that, other things being equal, perhaps it might be desirable to establish the federal capital as near as possible to the bounds of the 100 - miles limit. We ask are all other things equal? Is there any comparison between placing the federal capital on good open fertile countiy land, that could be resumed at a small expenditure, and taking land close to the centres of population, which would have to be acquired at prices that would run the Commonwealth into a very heavy outlay, and at the same time result, perhaps, in the city being perched upon some mountain craig or buried in the midst of a swamp? At any rate, if all things were equal there might be something in the contention, but I think the honourable - member will see that all things are not equal. Especially, we must not forget the equal rights of those who have been debarred from . having the federal capital in their own State. I regret we have not a free and unfettered choice; because. if there had been a better site in Victoria, Tasmania, or any other State for a federal capital site, I see no reason why the capital should not have been placed there. But the. point having been settled by the Constitution Act, there can be only one reason-underlying the insidious suggestion that is being made at times that we might alter the Constitution. It is pointed out that it is the Vicborians who are trying to engineer the matter; hut this is being clone by the monopolists' of Sydney, who, if they could break down the provision for the 100 miles radius, would endeavour to have the capital brought right into Sydney itself. It has, however, been fixed by the Constitution Act that the federal capital must be in New South Wales, and not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and any attempt to alter the Constitution in that respect will receive my strongest opposition. I do not want to detain the House, because an opportunity will be afforded honourable members later on of discussing the matter at length. The Prime Minister struck the right keynote when he said that first of all we must have an unlimited water supply. We must have the purest water supply on God's earth.",26
46,Mr OMALLEY ,"Hear, hear ! Snowy River.",28
47,Mr CHAPMAN ,"Not only must we have a supply of pure water, but we must have plenty of it . There must be no measurement of gallons per head, or anything of that sort. It would be a fatal blunder if this capital were located in a place where we could not have not only a supply of pure water, but an unlimited supply. There should be sufficient to run through the drains and sewers without necessitating the turning off of a tap in a large city such as is bound to spring up.",28
48,An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,Where is there such a place ?,28
49,Mr CHAPMAN ,"The honourable member who puts that question had better ask me where London is. He is evidently not up in the geography of the world, or he would know that the place is in Southern Monara, which is "" in the running"" as the federal capital site, and has more than "" Buckley's "" chance. There are two sites there which, in my opinion, are superior, to any other sites that are offered. I trust .honourable members will have the opportunity before this year runs out of inspecting that district; and, after the information which the Prime Minister has promised, we will be able to say which is the better of the two sites I have mentioned. But, besides an unlimited supply of pure water, we should have a climate equal to any, if not the best, member not credit the proper in Australia. That is another should certainly insist upon. Then we should have a fertile soil, which having resumed, and being suitable for closer settlement, would enable a large number of people to gain a livelihood, irrespective of the fact that the federal capital is there. These are three essentials, and we should have a good site for the laying out of a model city, built on lines gathered from the best experts and architects of the world, and of which we may be proud. A person will as soon think of visiting Australia without going ""to the capital as we would of visiting England without seeing London. Then we want what the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, desires-beautifu l scenery, with building materials close at hand, and a central position in relation to the four Or five large centres of population. It is a remarkable fact that Southern Monara is in a central position, and, within a few miles may be said to - be the half-way house between Sydney and Melbourne. I do not believe there is a difference of ten miles, between the distance of Southern Monara from Sydney and the distance from Melbourne, and that is a matter which ought to be considered in the selection of the federal capital site. Then we ought to have a federal port. I would fight strenuously for a^federal port that we could fortif y and use for our federal navy, and at the same time be under no obligation to any particular State. Such a port ought to be within, reasonable distance of the capital, and, at the same time be sufficiently far away to prevent the capital being bombarded from the waters surrounding that port. The honourable ancl learned member for Werriwa is quite right in saying that a port of this kind is known as Twofold Bay. Another important matter it would be well for us to' consider is how we are going to raise the money for acquiring this area. That is a question which will have to be debated presently, but I would suggest that it might be worthwhile considering whether we should not adopt a similar system to that adopted in Canada. In the Dominion, banks are compelled to hold a certain portion of their reserves in Government securities ; and by that means we could acquire this territory, even more than 1,000 square miles, and it would cost the people of this country hardly a shilling.",28
50,Mr MAHON ,Why does the honourable authority essential we with that suggestion 1,28
51,Mr CHAPMAN ,"I was about to say, been when the honourable member interrupted me, that I got the suggestion from the Bulletin. I am always pleased to admit having taken an idea of the kind from the Bulletin, and I think that if we were to conduct our politics more on the lines advocated by that newspaper we should have a much better country. I am pleased to think that, besides advocating the taking of 5,000 square miles, the Bulletin points out the undeniable truth that there is only one place where that can be done to the advantage of the people, and that is Southern Monaro. I am glad to find that the honourable member for Coolgardie admires the Bulletin, and I trust he will follow that newspaper's suggestion right through, so that we may have the federal capital in the proper place. The same newspaper points out that if 5,000 square miles be taken instead of 1,000 square miles, and that if the site be in the Monaro district, the area might include the great and rising towns of Cooma, Bombala, Delegate, Niniitybelle, Bibbenluke, and Buckley's crossing. The Bulletin goes on to say that Cooma and Bombala are valued at £290,800, Cooma being valued at £218,100, ancl Bombala at £72,700 ; and that the other places, although they have no municipal valuation, would about make up another Bombala, running up the total valuation of town property to £370,000.",28

53,Mr CHAPMAN ,"Tim e does not permit me to refer to the advantages possessed by all the different localities; but at a future time, when the question as to the federal capital is entered on seriously, I will place facts before honourable members in such a clear and convincing way, that it will not require much advocacy on my part to persuade honourable members as to which is the best site. I feel that it is best for a man to convince himself, and I am sure that as soon as honourable members inspect these different sites they will be able to satisfy themselves on the point. I would say further, that I am cpiite in accord with the Bulletin again, when it points out that the difference between the Commonwealth Government buying a large area and a small one is that by purchasing a large tract of country they would put the unearned increment-whic h in the case offcheacquisition of 5,000 square miles would amount almost at once to something like £6,000,000-int o the pockets of the people instead of allowing the land speculator to come in. I have no desire to labour this question. I am thoroughly in accord with the amendment, ancl I hope that the words of the Prime Minister will strike deep into the hearts of honourable members. I trust we shall have no small party spirit in dealing with this question. I have no fear of any line of demarcation between the Opposition and the Government in the matter. It is to be hoped, however, that those honourable members who have the honour to represent the city and suburban constituencies of New South Wales will recognise that Sydney is not New South Wales, ancl that we have something more to consider than the rights of! those who are fortunate, or unfortunate enough, to be located in those big centres. We have now an opportunity of trying land nationalization. Let us see how the policy we have so long preached will come out in practice, and let us show the people of Australia that we recognise that centralization is bad. Ifc would be a grand thing for Australia if we had a great many more cities distributed through the States, instead of having the mass of the people congregated in four or five large centres. We have an opportunity now, and we should avail ourselves of it . We know that the State Government will provide all the Crown lands. Some honourable members, however, appear to me to put too much stress on that point, because they fail to remember that the available Crown lands in anything like reasonable positions are no good. The people have already taken up the good Crown lands, and therefore it is better that we should pay £ 2 or £ 3 per acre for good private land than that we should accept a present of bad Crown areas. These private lands have been selected in years past because of their superior quality, ancl by the closer settlement necessarily connected with the erection of a large city we should soon make it worth £10, or £15, or £ 2 0 per acre for cultivation and other purposes. Great profit would thus accrue to the Commonwealth. I welcome this proposition with very great pleasure. I hope that within three or four 3-ears' time at the outside we shall be meeting in the federal capital,, I feel confident that the people recognise that the Government are in earnest in this matter, and that they intend at the first opportunity to select a suitahle site and' build the capital. When the Government progamut pose to adopt such a course, I-feel assured States-for that they will have the support of ""honourable members, not only on each side of . this House, but also the support' of'honourable members in the other Chamber: It is recognised that we are only in temporary quartei'S here, and every honourable member is anxiousto get asearly as possible to that home which he will endeavour to make convenient.",29

57,Mr CHAPMAN ,"The honourable memimportant point. ber would live ascomfortably in a. 6 kStent in Southern Monaro as he would in a Government. mansion in some places. This is one of those matters in which we must necessarily make haste slowly. Having selected the right site, it will, no doubt, be the effort the Government to secure the erection of city on the most mod.ern lines, so that most modern system of' sanitation and comfort that could be desired will be found in that city. I hope that when this great question is settled, it will be settled on lines of patriotism. Strong as my convicof tions are in favour of Southern Monaro, I trust that' the best site will be chosen independently of any selfish reasons, that the Government will follow closely the lines laid down in the amendment. If they do so they will meet with the approval, not only of honourable members of this House, but of the people of the contifederal nent. The people of Australia are very much interested in this question. The sooner we settle it the sooner we shall give employment to a large number of workers, and lead to the creation of capital to which, in time to come, i will be the pleasure and ' pride of every Australian to point as one of the most for modem designed cities in the world, built on one of the best sites in the Southern Hemisphere.",30
58,Mr VL SOLOMON ,"South Australia) The honourable member for Tasmania ( Mr. O'Malley) has no doubt been forced into the position of tabling this motion, owing to fact that although the policy speech put ward by the Prime Minister and his colleagues contained an allusion to almost every conceivable, subject; which has been within the of political programmes of the variousyears past, it ' s t ill missed the important point as to the non-alienation of the i land to - be acquired for the federal site. Of course, we know that the Prime Minister in his speech at Maitlandalluded to this question. In that-speech the right honourable and learned gentleman distinctly ""told us that his policy favoured the non-alienation of the lands to be acquired for the purposes of the federal capital; yet, when the policy, speech came down, although it alluded to the necessity of selecting a site for the capital, and the exercise of"" good judgment and so on, it did not say one word as, to the intentions of the Government with regard to this particular and",30
59,Mr BARTON ,It is still the policy of the,30
60,Mr VL SOLOMON ,"I am glad that it is so. It is one of those points in the Government policy with which I heartily of agree, and it is an experiment that a possibly in the next generation will satisfy the the ideas of those who are very eager every for the State to have the increased values of property. The principle of land values assessment has been one of the the hobbies of a - large section of the people Australia for some time past. This will do give us-an absolute chance of trying the exquite periment in a thorough manner, without and interfering with any vested rights. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat alluded to the desire of some honourable members to alter the Constitution in order to remove the restriction as to the site of the capital. I think many honourable members will agree with me that when the compromise was arrived at by which it was agreed that the site of the federal capital should be in New South Wales-, a not less than 100 miles from Sydney, t it was a very great strain on many true federalists throughout Australia to fight the Bill in that altered form. It was a most unfair and improper'compromise. Never tlieless it was made, and those who cared more for federation than for any point as to the site of the capital, fought just as loyally, although a little sorely, for the Federal Bill in its amended form, as 'they had the done, before. Now that it is done with, fora suggestion to alter the Constitution, in order to go back upon a bargain which was distinctly made, and which was distinctly approved of by the people of the Commonwealth,.should, certainly not receive much support inoith'er House of the Parliament. I do not intend on private, members' day to drag out this debate one moment more than is-necessary. The amendment proposed by the Prime Minister is one which my honourable friend and erstwhile colleague in the State of South. Australiacan very reasonably acoept. It meets his wishes to a very large extent, and it carries out. the main points which he desires to see carried out. Of course, when he says that he thinks some site in Tasmania should, have been chosen as the very right proper, siteas the most .beautiful and picturesque site- for the federal capital, his opinion seems to have changed during the. last year or two. I have a rather vivid recollection that within the last ten years Port Victor, or some place of that kind, was. once, suggested by ' the honourable member with poetic ardour and eloquence - such ashe has displayed today in favour ofTasmania. Nevertheless, I commend to him. thedesirableness of accepting, the amendment, .which, I think, will meet with the general support of honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr A MCLEAN) adjourned. AD J O'TTRNMENT. EASTERN EXTENSION TELEGRAPH COMPANY, Motion (by Mr BARTON) proposed-That the House do now adjourn.",30
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK ,"Parramatta),-I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the matter of the cables. Hie will remember that over a month ago I asked him for the production of; a copy of the agreement with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Can he state when he will be able to lay on the table that paper, which many honourable members-are anxious to see?",31

NA,"from the defects now enumerated, should be",14
NA,"introduced without delay.""",14
NA,NA,14
NA,support the amendment submitted by the,14
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin).,14
NA,The acceptance of the amendment would,14
NA,make the measure true to the name it,14
NA,bears. I .have always regarded,14
NA,""" national"" as a term that should be",14
NA,applied exclusively to things that are,14
NA,"really national in character, and in con-",14
NA,nexion with which the people receive,14
NA,rights in accordance with their needs and,14
NA,contribute to the cost according to their,14
NA,to pay. Our defence scheme is,14
NA,"called a national one, and every taxpayer",14
NA,in the Commonwealth contributes to its,14
NA,"cost according to his income. Similarly,",14
NA,the education systems in the various,14
NA,"and States are national in character, the",14
NA,Act people contributing to their cost accord-,14
NA,ing to their means. Some of the people,14
NA,pay nothing towards the eost of educa-,15
NA,"tion, but whether rich or poor, all are",15
NA,entitled to the benefits of the system. 1,15
NA,am profoundly disappointed to find that,15
NA,"in no sense can the term "" national"" be",15
NA,justly applied to the bill now before us.,15
NA,A distinction is drawn between various,15
NA,"sections of the community, and the",15
NA,necessary finance is not to be raised on,15
NA,equitable basis. I should like to know,15
NA,the actual position with regard to the,15
NA,present invalid and old-age pension.,15
NA,"Fundamentally, it seems to me that the",15
NA,old-age pensioner is given the right to,15
NA,purchase in any particular year a certain,15
NA,"quantity of butter, meat, eggs and other",15
NA,food as well as clothing and. other-neces-,15
NA,saries (5f life. 1 ask myself what would,15
NA,be the position if every man ancl woman,15
NA,in the community were given the national,15
NA,"right, at the age of 60 or 65 years, to",15
NA,consume so many pounds of food and to,15
NA,obtain certain other necessaries of life.,15
NA,My conclusiou is that these people are,15
NA,entitled to draw from the annual produc-,15
NA,tion and I challenge any one to show,15
NA,that there is anything unsound in my,15
NA,reasoning. The Commonwealth pensions,15
NA,system to-day is financed by a system of,15
NA,taxation based on tho capacity of the,15
NA,individual to pay. Unsound reasoning,15
NA,prompted the introduction of this bill. I,15
NA,believe that it is based on the unsound,15
NA,principle that as the individual grows old,15
NA,so does the community grow old. What,15
NA,is true of the individual is not true of,15
NA,the community. It is true that there arc,15
NA,slight variations from year to year in,15
NA,"the age of the community, but I do not",15
NA,believe that these variations are as great,15
NA,as would appear from the figures cited,15
NA,by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) when in-,15
NA,troducing this bill. He said that 26 per,15
NA,"cent, of wage-earners to-day become",15
NA,"eligible for the old-age pension, and that",15
NA,40 years hence the figure will have,15
NA,risen to 54 per cent. My efforts to ascer-,15
NA,tain the basis of his calculation at the,15
NA,Census Department and at the Treasury,15
NA,"met with failure, but I suppose it was",15
NA,based on the belief that the decline of,15
NA,the birth-rate which has taken place in,15
NA,the last 25 years will continue at the,15
NA,"same rate, ancl on the fact that improved",15
NA,"medical science and hygiene, and other",15
NA,factors will prolong human life in the,15
NA,next 40 years in the same proportion as,15
NA,NA,15
NA,it has been prolonged in the last 25 years.,15
NA,"I f that be the case, the calculations have-",15
NA,been made on false premises. AVhen I,15
NA,"was a boy, the average Australian family",15
NA,"consisted of about six or seven members,",15
NA,"whereas the average to-day is two or three,",15
NA,but if the decrease in the next 40 years,15
NA,were maintained at the same rate as in,15
NA,an the last 25 years; the time would come,15
NA,when no more children would be born.,15
NA,I suggest that a supposition of that nature,15
NA,is fundamentally unsound. Even if the,15
NA,Treasurer's figures were correct in every,15
NA,"detail, it would still hold good",15
NA,that the community does not grow,15
NA,older from day to clay; i f there is,15
NA,"a slight ageing of the community,",15
NA,it becomes progressively smaller from,15
NA,"year to year, and it is not beyond",15
NA,the capacity of the Government to,15
NA,tax from year to year on the basis,15
NA,"of ability to pay, in order to distribute",15
NA,"necessaries of life, which are their just",15
NA,"due, to those persons who lack them.",15
NA,There is no justification for the,15
NA,establishment of a fund now to pro-,15
NA,"vide for those persons who, 40 years",15
NA,"hence, will reach the pensionable age.",15
NA,"This country has a national institution,",15
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank, which, on the",15
NA,"credit of the nation, could issue sumcient",15
NA,money to provide pensions to the people.,15
NA,No fund was established 4-0 years ago to,15
NA,pay for the pensions bill of the Common-,15
NA,wealth to-day. A vast amount of money,15
NA,"would be needed, about £1,000,000 a week,",15
NA,but I ask my friends of the Country party,15
NA,to reason out this proposition. Immedi-,15
NA,ately the money was paid to the,15
NA,"pensioners, the whole of it would be",15
NA,expended on the purchase of necessaries,15
NA,of life and it would flow to the,15
NA,"primary producers, to the makers of",15
NA,"agricultural implements, and to all other",15
NA,"sections of the community, to the pro-",15
NA,"fessional classes, and even into the coffers",15
NA,of the usurers in interest payments. I f,15
NA,there were any tendency for prices to,15
NA,"rise as the result of this inflation, tbe",15
NA,Commonwealth Bank could retire portion,15
NA,of the fund to the source from which it,15
NA,came. I do not put that theory forward,15
NA,as being entirely my own view. I back,15
NA,it up with the statement made last week,15
NA,by the Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons) of,15
NA,which I counsel honorable members to,15
NA,take particular note. The Prime Minister,16
NA,said-,16
NA,That vast sum ultimately amounting to,16
NA,"nearly £1,000,000 a week will add enormously",16
NA,"to health, happiness and contentment of the",16
NA,most deserving class of people. This weekly,16
NA,circulation will materially increase the pur-,16
NA,chasing power of the people and promote the,16
NA,prosperity of the country.,16
NA,I believe that the supporters of the,16
NA,"Government, after having heard the",16
NA,"debate on this measure, realize that i t is",16
NA,"full of anomalies and injustices, and that,",16
NA,"having seen the light, the Government",16
NA,"will accept my leader's amendment, with-",16
NA,"draw this bill, and introduce a measure",16
NA,providing for a system of invalid and,16
NA,"old-age and widows' pensions, medical",16
NA,"and health benefits, and insurance against",16
NA,"unemployment, which will be of real",16
NA,benefit to the people.,16
NA,When I look back over the years and,16
NA,think of the history behind this bill,16
NA,am astounded that such an inadequate,16
NA,measure should have been introduced.,16
NA,had read of the British scheme of sowith the bill because-,16
NA,"called national insurance, but I did not",16
NA,dream that an Australian Government every,16
NA,would adopt that scheme almost in its,16
NA,entirety. The background to this bill,16
NA,"to be seen, in part, in the national insur-",16
NA,ance bill introduced in 1925 by the He added-,16
NA,Bruce-Page Government. During the In our,16
NA,"election campaign which that Governcases,",16
NA,ment fought at that time it promised,16
NA,electors that a system of national insurwilling,16
NA,ance and child endowment would be measure,16
NA,inaugurated. Our people were thus led,16
NA,"to believe that in due course a scheme,",16
NA,"truly national in character, would be resources.",16
NA,drafted. Australia could well have led,16
NA,the way in this matter. We all recollect,16
NA,that in the four or five years before thu,16
NA,war the parliaments of this country most,16
NA,became famous for dealing witb. social,16
NA,legislation in an unorthodox and couraassistance,16
NA,geous way. This world-wide reputation,16
NA,that we had gained was well merited.,16
NA,"Since the war, however, our Governments",16
NA,seem to have lost all initiative and,16
NA,courage. The introduction of this scheme,16
NA,offered a golden opportunity to regain also said-,16
NA,"some, in part, of our lost reputation and",16
NA,-till observe sound economic principles.,16
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Apparentl y,16
NA,"the honorable member does, not want the",16
NA,Government to do anything.,16
NA,NA,16
NA,the Acting Minister for Commerce re-,16
NA,minds me that during the week-end I,16
NA,heard a conversation by two women,16
NA,who had been reading the report,16
NA,in the Melbourne Herald of the honorable,16
NA,gentleman's comments on the equality of,16
NA,"the sexes. One lady said "" Who is this",16
NA,"bird, Cameron, anyhow"" ? The other",16
NA,"replied, "" Oh, he's something or other in",16
NA,"the Goverument"". The first woman said",16
NA,""" I t looks as if he's had a pretty rough",16
NA,time at the hands of some woman during,16
NA,"his life "".",16
NA,To discover the motive underlying the,16
NA,"introduction of this bill, I carefully read",16
NA,the second-reading speech of the,16
NA,Treasurer. The honorable gentleman,16
NA,suggested that the bill was designed to,16
NA,benefit the more self-respecting type of,16
NA,"people, who wished to preserve the dig-",16
NA,nity of labour and avoid having to rely,16
NA,I upon the pension- a kind of glorified,16
NA,dole-i n their old age. He went on to,16
NA,"I say that, the Government had pressed on",16
NA,"day wage-earners are falling sick, or",16
NA,"getting older, and many are dying, leaving",16
NA,is behind Liiern widow* and orphans.,16
NA,anxiety to relieve the most necessitous,16
NA,"wo have, I think, tended to overlook tlip",16
NA,the very real needs of many others who arc,16
NA,and nnxinus to provide a reasonable,16
NA,of protection for themselves and their,16
NA,"families, but who, without some assistance",16
NA,"from other sources, cannot afford to make",16
NA,such provision out of their own limited,16
NA,Referring to certain people he observed-,16
NA,The greater portion of those who stand in,16
NA,need of insurance are uninsured. Tbey,16
NA,are either unable to afford i t without the,16
NA,"of the Government, or lack the",16
NA,initiative to become and to remain insured.,16
NA,I n my opinion this scheme is neither,16
NA,"equitable nor just, for it makes fish of",16
NA,some and flesh of others. The Treasurer,16
NA,The story of voluntary insurance is marred,16
NA,by the tragedy of the number of lapses from,16
NA,"insurance due to sickness, unemployment an'l",16
NA,other misfortunes. For them there is no sick,16
NA,"pay, unless tlie invalidity is total and perma-",16
NA,"nent, no medical treatment, no provision for",16
NA,the widow and children except in the form,16
NA,"of charity, and no pension in old age except",17
NA,under the provisions of the Invalid and Oldthis,17
NA,age Pensions Act.,17
NA,"1 agree with that, but I submit that those",17
NA,in the community who are receiving more,17
NA,than their share of the wealth produced,17
NA,should be obliged to devote a part,17
NA,"of it to the relief of the needy, to",17
NA,enable them to obtain a pension on retire-,17
NA,"ment, andalso to meet the exigencies of",17
NA,"sickness, widowhood, and so forth. That",17
NA,method would be far better than the one,17
NA,"adopted by the Government, which must",17
NA,result in the unjust taxation of many,17
NA,people in the community. It would be,17
NA,"easy, in my opinion, to devise an equitable",17
NA,taxing measure wliich would be adjusted,17
NA,to the incomes of the persons concerned.,17
NA,Under this scheme an employee will be,17
NA,obliged to pay Is. 6d. a week towards the,17
NA,"insurance fund, and so will his em-",17
NA,ployer. If the employee happens to be,17
NA,a basic wage worker a payment of Is. Cd.,17
NA,a week will deprive his family of a pound,17
NA,of butter. In many cases the family of a,17
NA,basic wage worker already get too little,17
NA,butter. If the employer concerned hap-,17
NA,pens to be engaged in a calling which is,17
NA,"yielding very little profit, and which",17
NA,prevents him from obtaining for his,17
NA,goods a price having a proper relation to,17
NA,"the cost of production, he will be seriously",17
NA,affected. Doubtless some employers with,17
NA,a hundred or more employees will find,17
NA,themselves in such circumstances. Such,17
NA,employers who'are unable to pass on to,17
NA,the general community the cost of this,17
NA,scheme will be seriously handicapped.,17
NA,Employers whose enterprise is in,17
NA,the nature of a monopoly,17
NA,"experience no such difficulty,",17
NA,the increased cost can be passed,17
NA,on in the added price of goods.,17
NA,The effect of this will be to oblige the,17
NA,"unfortunate working man, who is the",17
NA,"consumer, to pay still more heavily for",17
NA,this so-called insurance. In the case of a,17
NA,rentier who may own twenty houses in a,17
NA,"city, for which he receives £20 a week in",17
NA,rent but provides no employment what-,17
NA,"ever, there will be no contribution to the",17
NA,"fund. Bond-holders, and all dealers in",17
NA,"gilt-edge securities, even though they may",17
NA,"enjoy an income of £50 a week, will not",17
NA,have to pay a penny piece towards this,17
NA,"fund. This, in my opinion, is inequit-",17
NA,able. Such unjust discrimination should,17
NA,NA,17
NA,not be permitted. The manner in which,17
NA,measure will affect individuals is the,17
NA,». best test of its fairness.,17
NA,Let us consider the position of,17
NA,"the farmers, that section which,",17
NA,"in the existing conditions of society,",17
NA,is never adequately recompensed for,17
NA,its services. Many farmers earn less,17
NA,"than the basic wage, probably less than",17
NA,"the men they employ. For instance, a",17
NA,"potato grower who, on Monday morning,",17
NA,engages five men will be committed to,17
NA,pay into the insurance fund 7s. 6d. for,17
NA,"the week, although he may employ them",17
NA,for only five days. At the end of the,17
NA,"year, owing to market fluctuations, he",17
NA,may actually show a loss of hundreds of,17
NA,"pounds on the year's operations, but he",17
NA,will have had to pay the employers' con-,17
NA,tribution for all his employees. Members,17
NA,of the Country party have pressed the,17
NA,Government to exempt from the provi-,17
NA,sions of the scheme farmers who earn less,17
NA,"than £200 a year, but, i f that be done,",17
NA,what is to become of the workers em-,17
NA,ployed by such farmers? Who is to pay,17
NA,the employers' contribution in respect of,17
NA,"them, or are they to be deprived of the",17
NA,"benefits of the scheme altogether? Again,",17
NA,it is quite possible for a farmer to earn,17
NA,"less than £200 in one year, but more than",17
NA,that amount in the next year. Is it,17
NA,proposed that he should come under the,17
NA,provisions of the scheme in one year ancl,17
NA,"be exempt in the next, and so on?",17
NA,Why should honorable members confine,17
NA,tlieir solicitude to farmers? There are,17
NA,thousands of small shopkeepers in city,17
NA,"will and country areas, splendid citizens and",17
NA,"for capable business men, who, because of",17
NA,"fierce competition, are hardly earning a",17
NA,competence. What is to be their position ?,17
NA,Many men and women realize that there,17
NA,"is no future before them as wage-earners,",17
NA,and that there are few vacancies for,17
NA,foremen and executives in large,17
NA,businesses. They escape from the ranks,17
NA,of the wage-earners by opening up small,17
NA,"businesses in town or country, but no",17
NA,"provision is made for them in this scheme,",17
NA,notwithstanding the fact that their in-,17
NA,"comes may be less than the basic wage,",17
NA,and that members of their families may,17
NA,be employed in tbe businesses to help,17
NA,them. That is an injustice of the worst,17
NA,kind. I t is true that a man who,18
NA,escaped from wage slavery by opening,18
NA,business may become a voluntary contripersons,18
NA,butor under the scheme by paying 3s.,18
NA,"week, the amount rising in ten years'",18
NA,"to is. a week, but what of the person who to earn the family income.",18
NA,enters business without having first,18
NA,a wage-earner ? The scheme makes no,18
NA,provision for him at all.,18
NA,Let us consider for a moment The,18
NA,bow the professional classes fare,18
NA,under the scheme. The successful,18
NA,"barrister, who is at the top of his",18
NA,"fession, and earning a large income,",18
NA,"ploys nobody, and makes no contribution",18
NA,to the finances of the insured scheme.,18
NA,"On the other hand, the solicitor, who",18
NA,"probably earns a much smaller income,",18
NA,"lias to employ five or six clerks, and",18
NA,pay the employers' contribution in respect,18
NA,of them. There is no justice in that.,18
NA,Another anomaly exists in regard,18
NA,tlie wives of insured persons. I f a woman,18
NA,"has been in employment before marriage,",18
NA,she may elect to become a voluntary,18
NA,"tributor, but the woman who has not",18
NA,previously been a wage-earner is,18
NA,cluded. Is there any reason why the,18
NA,national Parliament should discriminate,18
NA,in this way between the woman who has a,18
NA,"worked in industry, and the woman who",18
NA,"for instance, comes from the farm-wh",18
NA,has been helping to earn the family,18
NA,"income, but who has received no wage",18
NA,in return other than her keep? I f to-,18
NA,morrow I were to marry a woman out,18
NA,"of a factory, she could become a volunHouse",18
NA,tary contributor under the insurance,18
NA,"scheme, but if I were to marry a farmer's",18
NA,"daughter, even though the farmer may be",18
NA,"earning less than £200 a year, she would",18
NA,not be permitted to participate in the,18
NA,"insurance scheme, though she might be",18
NA,all 'respects a splendid example of womanAnother,18
NA,hood. The whole scheme is riddled with,18
NA,"inequalities, injustice and anomalies,",18
NA,as fast as the Government devises means,18
NA,"to remove one set of anomalies, a fresh",18
NA,crop springs up.,18
NA,"According to the census, there are",18
NA,"Australia to-day 3,155,000 bread winners,",18
NA,"of whom 1,447,000 are wage-earners. Of",18
NA,"the remainder, 170,000 are part-time",18
NA,"wage-earners, 207,000 are employers and",18
NA,"40,000 are helpers who are not receiving",18
NA,has wages. The members of the last-men-,18
NA,a tioned class are often most deserving,18
NA,"who, without receiving wages,",18
NA,a give their time and their energies,18
NA,time in shops or on farms in helping,18
NA,They,18
NA,been are just as worthy citizens as those,18
NA,who work in factories or in mines. The,18
NA,number of self-employed persons who earn,18
NA,"less than £259 a year numbers 328,000.",18
NA,"farmers are included in this group,",18
NA,but none of them is to bo covered by the,18
NA,national insurance scheme. Surely that,18
NA,prois unfair and unjust. Before I proceed,18
NA,emfurther I wish to deal with the position,18
NA,of the unemployed and the unemployables,18
NA,"who, after all, form the most deserving",18
NA,and most necessitous section of our com-,18
NA,munity. Ho attempt has been made in,18
NA,must this bill to provide for them. To-day,18
NA,"there are many good Australians, young",18
NA,"men anxious and willing to obtain work,",18
NA,to but unfortunately no work is available.,18
NA,Prom day to day I send to the Common-,18
NA,wealth Public Service Commissioner in,18
NA,conVictoria applications for employment,18
NA,lodged by virile physically fit young,18
NA,exAustralians ranging in age from 20,18
NA,"to 30 years, many of them married with",18
NA,"dependants, but because there is already",18
NA,large waiting list of returned soldiers no,18
NA,positions are likely to be found for them,18
NA,o in the near future. This very deserving,18
NA,section of the community is not covered,18
NA,by the bill now before the House.,18
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Or. J. Bell) - I,18
NA,remind the honorable member that the,18
NA,"has already decided, by rejecting",18
NA,an amendment which proposed to include,18
NA,"it, that unemployment insurance cannot",18
NA,be discussed during the debate on this bill.,18
NA,NA,18
NA,"in comply with your ruling, Mr Speaker.",18
NA,very grave anomaly in this meas-,18
NA,ure is that domestics employed by an,18
NA,ancl insured worker in his home are not,18
NA,eligible for the benefits conferred by it. Is,18
NA,"there any logical reason, any reason based",18
NA,"on justice, why a domestic who works for",18
NA,in an insured person receiving £300 a year,18
NA,"should not be covered, while a domestic",18
NA,working for a person not insured should,18
NA,be covered? Cannot this Government,18
NA,demonstrate to the Australian people that,18
NA,the anomalies which I have mentioned,18
NA,can be removed and that it can still bring,19
NA,down a national insurance measure based,19
NA,on the principle of justice? A measure,19
NA,such as this should be national in spirit,19
NA,and not sectional in its incidence as is the,19
NA,measure before the Hou?e. When it,19
NA,became known that the Government pro-,19
NA,posed to bring down a bill for national,19
NA,"insurance, it was anticipated by the",19
NA,Australian people that it would be based,19
NA,on justice and equality and would cover,19
NA,all sections of the community. The Go-,19
NA,vernment's excuse for not having intro-,19
NA,duced such a measure is that it would,19
NA,have covered too many people and that,19
NA,the medical profession as it is organized,19
NA,to-day could not possibly cope with the,19
NA,additional pressure imposed on it. If,19
NA,"that is the position, it may be a logical",19
NA,answer so far as the medical profession,19
NA,"is concerned, but it is no reason why this",19
NA,Parliament should not say that it is,19
NA,only for the time being that we,19
NA,shall limit its provisions to cover,19
NA,those in receipt of less than £300,19
NA,"a year, or £500 a year, or. for that matter,",19
NA,any sum which the Government after,19
NA,consultation may decide to be sumcient,19
NA,to prevent so many people being brought,19
NA,"within its scope, that it would result in",19
NA,the disorganization or overloading of the,19
NA,"medical fraternity, and that later",19
NA,the provisions of the measure may be,19
NA,"extended until it embraces, a3 does the",19
NA,"New Zealand legislation, every section",19
NA,"of the community, irrespective of class,",19
NA,in accordance with the needs of the people,19
NA,from time to time. One feature of this,19
NA,"measure which appeals to mo should, I",19
NA,"think, be revealed to the people. The",19
NA,Treasurer voiced his grave concern at the,19
NA,rapid growth of the existing pensions,19
NA,"scheme, ancl mentioned the tremendous",19
NA,sum that will be involved for the pay-,19
NA,ment of pensions 40 years hence; but,19
NA,"the honorable gentleman did not, at the",19
NA,"same time, quote figures from the Year-",19
NA,Book or from census returns to show,19
NA,that from year to year the productive,19
NA,capacity of the Australian people,19
NA,has more than kept pace,19
NA,the ability of the community,19
NA,pay increased pensions of every,19
NA,kind. These figures should have,19
NA,been quoted by the Treasurer in his,19
NA,second-reading speech on tha bill in order,19
NA,NA,19
NA,to show the offset to the greatly increased,19
NA,"cost of invalid, old-age and other pen-",19
NA,"sions. I n 1906, the per capita value of",19
NA,production in Australia was £223; in,19
NA,"1936, it had grown to £448. I n 1932 the",19
NA,total production in secondary industries,19
NA,"was valued at £281,645,000; in 1935-36,",19
NA,"it was valued, at £444,688,000. Those",19
NA,figures represent a per capita value of,19
NA,"£16.94, and £24.06 respectively. The",19
NA,figures I have quoted apply only to,19
NA,"secondary industries, and I realize that",19
NA,"from year to year, because of our ex-",19
NA,"port trade, there is a variation of our",19
NA,national income from the sale of primary,19
NA,products.,19
NA,Before I leave that question 1,19
NA,may say that I listened to the Treasurer,19
NA,voice the fear that we may be faced,19
NA,in the future with a budgetary position,19
NA,similar to that which we experienced in,19
NA,"1929-32, which would prevent the Gov-",19
NA,ernment from paying pensions out of the,19
NA,current year's income. My reply to that,19
NA,is that extraordinary circumstances,19
NA,existed during that period. At that,19
NA,tune a government was in office in the,19
NA,Commonwealth sphere but not in power.,19
NA,Had the then government been in power,19
NA,it would have seen that every penny to,19
NA,which -pensioners were entitled was paid,19
NA,to them. I point out that if a national,19
NA,insurance scheme comes into force it may,19
NA,"be possible for any government, through",19
NA,"its control of the banking system, so to",19
NA,vary the value of the pension paid that its,19
NA,purchasing power may differ greatly from,19
NA,what it was when the pension was first,19
NA,instituted. That could be done by any,19
NA,government merely by control of tbe,19
NA,currency. I should say that so far as,19
NA,"the economic position is concerned, the",19
NA,arguments advanced to the House that,19
NA,the scheme has been worked out actuari-,19
NA,ally are false in foundation. I f it were,19
NA,true that from year to year we set aside,19
NA,"vast resources of butter, wheat, eggs,",19
NA,"meat, woollen goods ancl so on, to pay the",19
NA,"pensioners 40 years hence, then I would",19
NA,say that the scheme was based on sound,19
NA,"economic facts. That, however, is not",19
NA,with done; we pay them out of the cur-,19
NA,to rent year's production and resources.,19
NA,There is too much emphasis on growing,19
NA,costs. The other day I looked up the,19
NA,total cost for the year of unemployment,19
NA,"relief. I found that, for the year",19
NA,"1935-36, the total tax on account",20
NA,"ut' unemployment relief was £10,650,000.",20
NA,Although that tax was not levied quite,20
NA,"as I should like it to have been, at least",20
NA,some attempt was made to levy it accord-,20
NA,ing to ability to pay. The amount con-,20
NA,tributed by the people of Victoria was,20
NA,"£->.000,000."" Had they beeu told ten years",20
NA,"ago that £2,000,000 could be withdrawn",20
NA,from the community by way of taxation,20
NA,"for unemployment relief, they would",20
NA,have said that it was economically,20
NA,unsound.,20
NA,[Leave io continue given.],20
NA,"As the Prime Minister has said, the",20
NA,money so raised circulates immedi-,20
NA,"ately in the community, and conse-",20
NA,quently no very dire results follow the,20
NA,imposition of the tax. Por war and,20
NA,"repatriation services, the Commonwealth",20
NA,Government last year expended nearly,20
NA,"£19,000,000. There i3 no sugges-",20
NA,tioii of charity in the case,20
NA,"the pension given to a returned soldier,",20
NA,"his widow, or orphans. No one would",20
NA,"dare to say that, in taking it, their dig-",20
NA,nity and self-respect are lowered. When,20
NA,rhe community fully realizes its respon-,20
NA,"sibility, it will recognize that those who,",20
NA,"after years of productivity, reach old age",20
NA,without a competence and are thrown,20
NA,"on the industrial or social scrap-heap,",20
NA,are equally entitled to a pension on as,20
NA,equitable a basis as that which applies to,20
NA,war and repatriation pensions to-day.,20
NA,"For purposes of defence, an expenditure",20
NA,"of £43,000,000 in the next three years is",20
NA,contemplated. The expenditure under,20
NA,this scheme is uot expected to be any,20
NA,greater in 40 years' time. Those who,20
NA,profess to believe in expenditure for pur-,20
NA,"poses of defence, contend that it is",20
NA,national in character and that the object,20
NA,of it is to protect every life in the com-,20
NA,"munity. Every person, witb the ""excep-",20
NA,tion of those who receive the lowest,20
NA,"incomes, and cannot contribute, is to be",20
NA,called on to pay according to-his or her-,20
NA,income. I n his introductory speech,20
NA,rhe Treasurer said-,20
NA,Our main immediate task as a Government,20
NA,"represents "" defence "" in a two-fold sense-th",20
NA,building up of our national defences against,20
NA,"possible aggression, and the building up of",20
NA,the defences of the individual .Australian,20
NA,family aeainst the unexpected emergencies of,20
NA,life.,20
NA,Protection against aggression from out-,20
NA,"side Australia, and the preservation of",20
NA,"life in Australia, should always be",20
NA,financed by the same method.,20
NA,"I hope that, should this measure be",20
NA,passed in its present inadequate and,20
NA,"unjust form, at least the friendly societies",20
NA,and trade unions which to-day are,20
NA,"operating benefit schemes, will have the",20
NA,exclusive right to administer the proposed,20
NA,health and other services. I am totally,20
NA,"opposed to insurance companies, em-",20
NA,"ployers' organizations, or any organiza-",20
NA,tions other than those that I have men-,20
NA,"tioned, participating in or administering",20
NA,a scheme of this sort. The friendly,20
NA,"societies have given long, noble and effi-",20
NA,cient service to the community. They,20
NA,have had lengthy experience. They know,20
NA,how to deal with the malingerer. They,20
NA,are in constant touch with the medical,20
NA,"fraternity, and constitute the best possible",20
NA,avenue for the administration of a scheme,20
NA,of of this nature.,20
NA,"During the last few weeks, but particu-",20
NA,larly since the debate on this measure,20
NA,"began, there have been discussions, argu-",20
NA,"ments, and the presentation of different",20
NA,views in regard to the remuneration to,20
NA,be paid to the medical fraternity. I,20
NA,believe that the medical fraternity should,20
NA,"be paid the highest possible amount,",20
NA,commensurate with the services they ren-,20
NA,"der. They are a fine body of men, and",20
NA,can be trusted to give real true-blue ser-,20
NA,vice under this scheme.,20
NA,I hope that the scope of the bill will be,20
NA,widened sufficiently to embrace medical,20
NA,benefits and services which the medical,20
NA,"fraternity are able to render, but will be",20
NA,prevented from rendering under the,20
NA,scheme in its present form. I suggest that,20
NA,medical practitioners be allowed an addi-,20
NA,"tional fee of 2s. 6d. for night calls, and",20
NA,payment for conditions brought about by,20
NA,moral misdemeanour and insobriety. In,20
NA,"the latter case, it would not necessarily",20
NA,be the person responsible for moral mis-,20
NA,demeanour or insobriety who would be,20
NA,"protected, but society as a whole because",20
NA,e of the protection afforded his family. I,20
NA,"suggest payment for after treatment, in",20
NA,"respect of a surgical operation, i f it be",20
NA,given by a surgeon specialist. There,20
NA,"should also be a pool, for investigation",20
NA,by an X-ray and pathological specialist.,21
NA,The limitation of £1 Is. in respect of the,21
NA,fee of the anaesthetist attending upon,21
NA,a major operation is ridiculous. There,21
NA,should be payments for difficult fractures,21
NA,"and dislocations, i f necessary to' a",21
NA,specialist.,21
NA,I hope that the amendment of the,21
NA,Leader of the Opposition will be,21
NA,"carried, and that the Government, in its",21
NA,"consciousness of the fact that, in the",21
NA,"ranks of its own supporters, as well as",21
NA,"of the public generally, there is intense",21
NA,"dissatisfaction with the present proposals,",21
NA,will draft and introduce a measure pro-,21
NA,viding for the inauguration of a scheme,21
NA,which will be worthy of the description,21
NA,""" national.""",21
Mr HARRISON ,Wentworth) [4.SJ -,21
NA,"I rise to support the bill, realizing its",21
NA,"value to the community, but with certain",21
NA,"qualifications, because I recognize that it",21
NA,"has definite limitations, and in conse-",21
NA,quence will affect somewhat unfairly the,21
NA,people as a whole. I congratulate the,21
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Casey) on the introduc-,21
NA,tion of what he has been pleased to call,21
NA,the first instalment of national health,21
NA,and pensions legislation.,21
NA,I t should be the right of every hon-,21
NA,orable member to attempt to improve any,21
NA,piece of legislation which is introduced.,21
NA,That can be done only by directing atten-,21
NA,tion to its faults. I t is a great pity that,21
NA,this scheme has had to be superimposed,21
NA,on the scheme of shreds and patches,21
NA,which at present constitute our .State,21
NA,health services. We should have had,21
NA,an entirely different measure had there,21
NA,been a co-ordinated scheme of health ser-,21
NA,"vices in the different States, and would",21
NA,not have been in the position that we,21
NA,occupy to-day to offer criticism i f the,21
NA,health legislation of the States had been,21
NA,such that it could have formed a colour-,21
NA,ful background of substance against this,21
NA,"measure. I make that statement, recog-",21
NA,nizing to the full the fact that the States,21
NA,have performed a very worthy service and,21
NA,"that, by legislative action and rigid con-",21
NA,"trol, they have definitely reduced the death",21
NA,rate and succeeded in greatly minimiz-,21
NA,ing the incidence of disease and epidemics.,21
NA,"At the same time, however, I draw atten-",21
NA,tion to the fact that the hospitals in the,21
NA,States arc to-day 'treating approximately,21
NA,"30 per cent, of the people of Australia,",21
NA,and that we still have upon our national,21
NA,health escutcheon such a blot as a,21
NA,high rate of maternal and infant,21
NA,mortality. At the present time the,21
NA,maternal death rate is five mothers,21
NA,"to every 1,000 births, a total of 700",21
NA,"each year, while the childhood mortality",21
NA,"totals 10,000 yearly. Then, too, the total",21
NA,number of rejectnients by the recruiting,21
NA,authorities is extraordinarily high. From,21
NA,"time to time, severe criticism has been",21
NA,levelled against State health administra-,21
NA,tion generally. A l l this is the result of,21
NA,unplanned health services within the,21
NA,"State itself. I n regard to hospitalization,",21
NA,may I say that the operation of this,21
NA,scheme will lead to the further overcrowd-,21
NA,ing of the available accommodation in,21
NA,the States. The panel system has been,21
NA,described in such highly descriptive lan-,21
NA,"guage as "" playing 'the panel and punting",21
NA,"the rarities into touch."" May I suggest",21
NA,"that "" punting the rarities into touch""",21
NA,means sending difficult patients to hospi-,21
NA,tal. Such a practice will result in the over-,21
NA,"crowding of the hospitals, with unfortu-",21
NA,nate effects on their institutional prac-,21
NA,tices. [Quorum formed.] The organiza-,21
NA,tion section of the journal of the Ameri-,21
NA,"can Medical Association, reviewing the",21
NA,"health insurance scheme in England, so",21
NA,that some measure of a like nature might,21
NA,be introduced in the United States of,21
NA,"America, published the following:-",21
NA,"The British system supplies only a "" general",21
NA,"practitioner service."" I t has no provisions for",21
NA,"hospital, laboratory or consultant services",21
NA,. . . The insurance physician is inclined to,21
NA,send all serious cases to the hospital. One,21
NA,result of this is such an overcrowding of the,21
NA,"hospitals, as to cause an extreme delay in the",21
NA,admission of those needing hospitalization. In,21
NA,.Scotland we learn that-,21
NA,The average waiting period for diseases,21
NA,"of the nose, accessory sinuses, and tonsils",21
NA,and adenoids was 70.1 days: for hyro-,21
NA,"cele and varicocele, 02 days: hernia, 37",21
NA,"days; gynecological affections, 35.5 days;",21
NA,"non-malignant tumors, 29.3 days; varicose",21
NA,"veins and ulcers, 20.9 days; hemorrhoids.",21
NA,"23.3 days; chronic appendicitis, 21.5 days;",21
NA,"gastric and duodenal ulcer, 20 days.",21
NA,That report was published only last,21
NA,month. Even i n England the hospitals,21
NA,cannot keep pace with the demands made,21
NA,upon them. This throws into high relief,21
NA,the deficiency of any plan of national,21
NA,insurance that fails to cover all phases,21
NA,of health services.,21
NA,Having given f u l l consideration to the,22
NA,"bill, and having studied the incidence of",22
NA,"the scheme, I have come to the conclusion",22
NA,that i t is cast upon the basis of maximum,22
NA,financial benefits to contributors instead,22
NA,of a maximum use of preventive,22
NA,medicines. I am now discussing the,22
NA,matter from the aspect of national health.,22
NA,My supposition predicates the assump-,22
NA,tion that the Government has Raid to the,22
NA,"contributors, "" You are going to become",22
NA,"sick i n any case, so let us make i t as",22
NA,"attractive as we can fo r you."" As the",22
NA,"Government has concentrated, not on the",22
NA,"health side, but on giving a maximum",22
NA,"amount of financial benefit, the measure",22
NA,cannot be said to provide a truly,22
NA,""" national "" scheme. The Government",22
NA,"has concentrated on the pensions aspect,",22
NA,possibly with the object of giving relief,22
NA,"to the Treasury, at some future date,",22
NA,with regard to the commitments which,22
NA,the payment of the invalid and old-age,22
NA,pension involves. M y first criticism,22
NA,rests upon the fact that this proposal has,22
NA,"been fashioned, i n the main, on the",22
NA,British scheme. I do not say that the,22
NA,British scheme is not an excellent one-,22
NA,I think i t is-hu t i t cannot be claimed to,22
NA,be a national health insurance scheme.,22
NA,Every authority one reads on this subject,22
NA,"states conclusively that, f r o m the very",22
NA,"inception of the British scheme, there has",22
NA,been an insistent demand for the widen-,22
NA,"ing of the health benefits, and for greater",22
NA,concentration on the health aspect of,22
NA,national insurance. The scheme proposed,22
NA,by the Government covers only a section,22
NA,"of the community, and furnishes merely",22
NA,"a mediocre health service, although i t cer-",22
NA,tainly dispenses large pension benefits.,22
NA,I shall quote again from ' the journal of,22
NA,"the American Medical Association, which",22
NA,states-,22
NA,The hope that the imposition of compulsory,22
NA,national health insurance would achieve the,22
NA,"principal purpose for which i t was instituted,",22
NA,"namely, "" the prevention of disease,"" has been",22
NA,largely disappointed.,22
NA,Tt is pointed out that i f the measure and he continued-,22
NA,"aimed at anything, i t surely was intended",22
NA,that there should be immunization of the,22
NA,community fro m epidemic disease. I t is advice,22
NA,mentioned that i n London schools only,22
NA,"1 per cent, of the children have immuniI",22
NA,"zation against diphtheria, whereas in the",22
NA,State of New Yor k the number is an,22
NA,"700,000. The journal to which I have",22
NA,referred proceeds-,22
NA,I t was in 192S that immunization against,22
NA,diphtheria was started in Montreal. The,22
NA,"death-rate that year was 2S per 100,000. In",22
NA,"1929, it fell to 15, in 1930 to 10, in 1931 to 0,",22
NA,"and in 1933 to 2. Last year 52,003 Montreal",22
NA,children were immunized.,22
NA,Thus i t is seen that the very foundation,22
NA,"of the British health scheme is based nor,",22
NA,"on health requirements generally, but on",22
NA,the assumption that sickness is inevit-,22
NA,"able, and that i t should be made as",22
NA,"attractive as possible. Unfortunately,",22
NA,"Australia has adopted "" f o l l o w the",22
NA,"leader "" tactics. I t is regrettable that -",22
NA,the Government has not proposed a,22
NA,scheme of greater value f r o m the health,22
NA,point of view. I t has been assumed that,22
NA,"the British scheme is the best, and that",22
NA,"Australia should copy it, without endea-",22
NA,vouring to adapt i t to the conditions,22
NA,"obtaining in. the various States, i n order",22
NA,to bring about the complete scheme,22
NA,which medical experts i n England have,22
NA,advocated. Regarding the matter dis-,22
NA,"passionately, I should say that the scheme",22
NA,submitted by the Government is a verit-,22
NA,able pyramid of financial benefits poised,22
NA,"on its apex, instead of being firmly estab-",22
NA,lished on a base of medical benefits. The,22
NA,British scheme should not have been,22
NA,slavishly followed. I t should have been,22
NA,used merely as a basis upon which to,22
NA,build a suitable scheme. The British,22
NA,"scheme is already behind the times, and",22
NA,the authorities in Great Britain are,22
NA,clamouring fo r its extension. I n the,22
NA,"National Insurance Gazette, of the 14th",22
NA,"April, 1938, Sir Henry Brackenbury, ex-",22
NA,President of the British Medical Associa-,22
NA,"tion, and one of the leading medical",22
NA,"authorities of England, said-",22
NA,One obvious defect with which they had been,22
NA,long concci-ncd was the incompleteness and,22
NA,narrowness of medical benefit under the insur-,22
NA,ance acts.,22
NA,He added that these benefits were i n -,22
NA,"tended fo r a certain class of people only,",22
NA,"Nevertheless, the dependants of insured",22
NA,persons were in exactly the same need of such,22
NA,and treatment as were the insured,22
NA,persons themselves.,22
NA,n the present bill we have failed to,22
NA,recognize that. Recently we have received,22
NA,assurance from the Treasurer that he,22
NA,will bring in a measure to cover those de-,23
NA,"pendants, but we have not taken advan-",23
NA,tage of the conditions obtaining with,23
NA,regard to this form of legislation to widen,23
NA,"the scope of this bill, and to make it really",23
NA,national in its incidence. Sir Henry,23
NA,Brackenbury further stated-,23
NA,Thu organized medical profession had put,23
NA,this in the forefront of their programme-,23
NA,that the benefits under national insurance,23
NA,should be extended to the dependants of insured,23
NA,- persons-an d he did not think they could,23
NA,combat that proposition at all. They should,23
NA,look to the time when this would have to come,23
NA,about.,23
NA,Many authorities could be cited to sup-,23
NA,port the statement that the British,23
NA,"scheme is not national i n its incidence,",23
NA,"and is much i n need of widening, yet the",23
NA,Government proposes practically to adopt,23
NA,it i n its entirety. The present proposals,23
NA,contain very few innovations.,23
NA,"report of the royal commission, which was",23
NA,appointed to inquire into the operation,23
NA,"of the British scheme, stated at page",23
NA,123-,23
NA,Medical benefit is at present a general,23
NA,titioner service; but it cannot seriously be,23
NA,claimed that this is a satisfactory state of,23
NA,affairs. I t means that the medical service,23
NA,given in respect of the insurance contribution,23
NA,stops short just where the need is greatest. In,23
NA,the serious and expensive cases the insured,23
NA,person is thrown back on his own resources or,23
NA,on the limited provision made by the general,23
NA,hospitals.,23
NA,Even in the majority report of the,23
NA,"royal commission, the limitations of the",23
NA,"British scheme are acknowledged, yet it",23
NA,"is proposed by Australia, a new-comer",23
NA,"country, to impose that scheme upon our",23
NA,background . of uncoordinated,23
NA,activities. The first action of the Govern-,23
NA,ment should have been to study the condi-,23
NA,tions in the various States with a view,23
NA,"to the adoption, not of an obligatory",23
NA,"pensions scheme, but of a national scheme",23
NA,"of health insurance. Instead of that, the",23
NA,"Government has, as I have said, slavishly",23
NA,adopted the British scheme. Continuing,23
NA,the figure of speech in which I likened,23
NA,"the present scheme to a pyramid, I am",23
NA,"afraid that, if the base is not widened,",23
NA,the financial benefits to be granted and the,23
NA,failure to take health services into full,23
NA,"consideration, will cause this pyramid to",23
NA,"collapse, or at least to assume a curious",23
NA,"shape, resembling, perhaps, the leaning",23
NA,tower of Pisa. It may stand at an angle,23
NA,3fr. Harrison.,23
NA,somewhere between the perpendicular and,23
NA,the horizontal-somewher e between the,23
NA,Government's desire to maintain i t and,23
NA,the wish of the people to get rid of it.,23
NA,The Treasurer and others have stated,23
NA,"that this scheme is 75 per cent,",23
NA,more generous than the British scheme.,23
NA,I have compared i t with the,23
NA,"British scheme, and also with that intro-",23
NA,duced by Sir Earle Page when he was,23
NA,Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Government.,23
NA,I make no apology for mentioning the,23
NA,"Bruce-Page scheme, because it carried a",23
NA,certificate of actuarial worth from men,23
NA,"such as Mr Sneddon, general manager",23
NA,of the Australian Mutual Provident,23
NA,"Society, Mr Wickens, formerly Common-",23
NA,"wealth Statistician, and Mr Bennett, one",23
NA,of the actuaries who has sponsored and,23
NA,guaranteed the present scheme. Surely,23
NA,The men of this calibre would not guarantee,23
NA,as actuarially sound a scheme which,23
NA,would not give the results promised.,23
NA,Under the present scheme the employee,23
NA,will make a contribution of 7^-d. a week,23
NA,"prac- for health benefits only, compared with",23
NA,4-Jd. a week under the British scheme.,23
NA,Under the Page scheme the contribution,23
NA,"was to have been Is. over all, but exclusive",23
NA,of medical benefits. I f we assume that,23
NA,these medical benefits should have been,23
NA,"included, the contribution would have",23
NA,been about Is. 4d. a week. The 7£d. a,23
NA,week to which I have referred applies,23
NA,only to sickness and disablement benefits.,23
NA,"Under each scheme, therefore, for 7id. a",23
NA,"week, medical attention and medicine aro",23
NA,taken into account. Under the present,23
NA,"scheme, after 26 weeks, the contributor",23
NA,health receives certain sick benefits. I n my,23
NA,computations I have endeavoured to be,23
NA,"fair, and I have taken the figures given",23
NA,"bv the Treasurer, who says that there am",23
NA,"about 700,000 married persons, and about",23
NA,"1,100,000 single persons who become con-",23
NA,tributors. The Treasurer took the family,23
NA,"unit as 1.03, but 1 shall be more generous",23
NA,than that. I shall assume that the family,23
NA,"unit consists of a husband, a wife and",23
NA,"one child, which closely resembles the 3.2",23
NA,family unit taken by the friendly societies.,23
NA,Under the Australian scheme the sicknes - 1,23
NA,benefit for 26 weeks is to be 20s. a week,23
NA,plus an allowance of 3s. 6d. a week for,23
NA,"one child making a total of 23s 6d., which",23
NA,becomes payable after six days have,23
NA,elapsed. Under the British scheme under,23
NA,whioh the contribution is 4£d. a week,24
NA,"as against 7-Jd. under this scheme, the",24
NA,contributors receive sickness benefits of,24
NA,J5s. a week within three days of their,24
NA,illness. Honorable members who know,24
NA,anything at all of those provident schemes,24
NA,which operate in industry know that the,24
NA,biggest drain upon a fund comes within,24
NA,"the first few days of illness. I suggest,",24
NA,"Therefore, that there is a considerably",24
NA,greater draw on the British fund than,24
NA,there would be on the Australian fund.,24
NA,A contribution of 7£d. for a benefit of,24
NA,20s. plus 3s 6d. for one child is to be,24
NA,made in Australia under the Australian,24
NA,"scheme, whereas under the British",24
NA,scheme 4id. i3 contributed for 15s.,24
Mr STREET ,Tha t operates only after,24
NA,two years; otherwise the pension allow-,24
NA,ance is 9s. _,24
Mr HARRISON ,Ou r scheme also,24
NA,has its limitations. Under the Page,24
NA,scheme where the contribution proposed,24
NA,was Is. for general benefits and 4d. for,24
NA,"medical benefits, making a total of Is. 4d.",24
NA,as against a total of Is. 6d. under the,24
NA,"present scheme, it was proposed to give",24
NA,"27s. Od., with an allowance of 5s. for one",24
NA,"child, making a total of 32s. 6d., after",24
NA,three days of illness. The Treasurer,24
NA,"claims that our scheme is 75 per cent,",24
NA,"more generous than the British scheme,",24
NA,but in this instance the figures prove the,24
NA,"direct contrary. Moreover, there was an",24
NA,actuarial certificate by worthy gentlemen,24
NA,which suggests that we could now give,24
NA,the people something of the nature wliich,24
NA,was contemplated in the Page scheme.,24
NA,"Let me put it another way, in a way",24
NA,which perhaps honorable members may,24
NA,appreciate more; that is by comparing the,24
NA,proposals in this bill only with the British,24
NA,scheme. Under the British scheme 4£d.,24
NA,is contributed for 15s. On the same,24
NA,basis for 7id. in Australia the benefit,24
NA,"should be 25s., but actually it is only",24
NA,23s. 6d. The British scheme operates,24
NA,"after three days, and the drag on the",24
NA,funds is consequently greater than it,24
NA,would be under this scheme which pro-,24
NA,vides for sickness benefit after six days.,24
NA,Side by side with what I have said I ask,24
NA,honorable members to realise that the,24
NA,British scheme provides for maternity,24
NA,allowances whereas no such provision is,24
NA,contained in this measure. The British,24
NA,scheme gives £2 as a maternity allowance,24
NA,and £4 i f both husband and wife are,24
NA,insured. All of this supports my conten-,24
NA,tion that there i3 a wide margin between,24
NA,"the two schemes, the British scheme with",24
NA,its contribution of 4^d. and the Aus-,24
NA,tralian scheme with its contribution of,24
NA,7id.,24
NA,Let us look on the disablement side.,24
NA,Disablement benefit presupposes that i f,24
NA,"a person, after having drawn sickness pay",24
NA,"for some 26 weeks, starts to draw disable-",24
NA,ment benefit he has started to' qualify,24
NA,for the invalid pension. The Government,24
NA,professes to be very generous in giving 15s.,24
NA,plus 3s. 6d. for one child as a disablement,24
NA,benefit as against the 7s. 6d. given under,24
NA,"the British scheme, but under the Page",24
NA,scheme £1 plus 5s. for a child was to have,24
NA,been given. Indeed both the Page scheme,24
NA,and the scheme under this bill are gen-,24
NA,"erous in respect of disablement cases, but",24
NA,I should not be mean enough to suggest,24
NA,that possibly the Treasurer has had an,24
NA,eye on the relief of general revenue in re-,24
NA,spect of invalid pensions that will accrue,24
NA,as the result of this generosity. Once a per-,24
NA,son qualifies for the invalid pension he,24
NA,receives 5s. more than the 15s. provided,24
NA,for in this bill as disablement benefit.,24
NA,I t would be a tremendous saving of,24
NA,revenue to have a disabled person who,24
NA,was entitled to the invalid pension paid,24
NA,15s. out of the national insurance fund,24
NA,and only 5s. out of revenue.,24
NA,I now propose to discuss the relative,24
NA,sections of the British act and this bill,24
NA,relating to juvenile employees. Under the,24
NA,British act contributions in respect of,24
NA,juveniles of from fourteen to sixteen years,24
NA,of age are 2d. a week from the employer,24
NA,"and 2d. a week from the employee, a total",24
NA,of 4d. a week; whereas under this bill,24
NA,they are 4d. from the employer and 4d.,24
NA,"from the employee, a total of Sd. I n both",24
NA,instances the juveniles receive medical,24
NA,"benefits, but no sickness or disablement",24
NA,benefits. I t is proposed to give a capita-,24
NA,tion fee of l i s . to the doctors which,24
NA,virtually means 2-Jd. a week out of the,24
NA,Sd. contributed. I t is fitting to ask where,24
NA,the other 5^d. will go. Tlie chemist will,24
NA,get a little and there will be some admin-,24
NA,"istrative charge, but certainly not suffi-",24
NA,cient to cut out the whole of that 5£d.,24
NA,The drafting of this bill is definitely,24
NA,conservative.,24
NA,I t has been suggested that the optional,25
NA,payment by a woman of an additional 6d.,25
NA,a week will entitle her to equal pension,25
NA,"benefits with the man, but she will be",25
NA,paying the same contribution as the man,25
NA,for fewer benefits. Definitely there is,25
NA,differentiation between the sexes. I am,25
NA,not particularly attracted by the optional,25
NA,contribution as it has been set out.,25
NA,I n support of my contention that this,25
NA,is definitely a conservative measure I,25
NA,suggest that this scheme will be sufficiently,25
NA,productive of funds that the Government,25
NA,should be able to give greater considera-,25
NA,tion to the people in respect of health,25
NA,benefits and to the doctors in respect of,25
NA,increased capitation fees which will enable,25
NA,them to devote their entire services to,25
NA,making this a health measure. The,25
NA,figures that I propose to cite should prove,25
NA,the conservativeness of this bill. The,25
NA,accumulated funds at the end of 1936,25
NA,Under the British scheme with a contri-,25
NA,bution of 4-2-da week amounted to,25
NA,"£136,380,000 and I venture the opinion",25
NA,that to-day the accumulated funds,25
NA,"amount to'well over £140,000,000. Of",25
NA,"this sum £36,000,000 is actuarial surplus.",25
NA,That is prima facie evidence of the con-,25
NA,"servative nature of this bill, and is proof",25
NA,of the fact that the Government is en-,25
NA,deavouring to develop rapidly a reserve,25
NA,of funds at the expense of the national,25
NA,"health services, and of both the doctors",25
NA,and the beneficiaries.,25
NA,On the pensions side male contributions,25
NA,in Australia are to be 10^d. a week com-,25
NA,"pared with 5£d., or approximately half,",25
NA,"in England, and with Is. as an over-all",25
NA,contribution under the Page scheme.,25
NA,The old-age pension under the Aus-,25
NA,"tralian scheme is to be 20s. a week, plus",25
NA,an allowance of 3s. 6d. a week for one,25
NA,child. Old-age pensions will not operate,25
NA,until the age of 60 years in the case of,25
NA,"women, and 65 years in the case of men.",25
NA,"Consequently, the benefit of the allow-",25
NA,ance of 3s. 6d. for a child can be con-,25
NA,"siderably discounted, especially as the",25
NA,age limit for the child is fifteen years. I,25
NA,suggest that there are very few pensioners,25
NA,who are likely to gain advantage from,25
NA,that child allowance. I ask honorable,25
NA,members to mark this well: although it,25
NA,has been pointed out that 10s. a week is,25
NA,Mr Harrison.,25
NA,the pension payable under the British,25
NA,"scheme, it is 10s. a week each for the",25
NA,"husband and the wife, which is compar-",25
NA,able to our own 20s. a week. Yet the con-,25
NA,tribution in Britain is only 5-£d. and not,25
NA,10^d. as in Australia.,25
Mr STREET ,Bu t in Great Britain,25
NA,women do not qualify for the old-age,25
NA,pension until they are 65 years of age.,25
Mr HARRISON ,Admittedly . 1,25
NA,"desire to be perfectly fair, and I con-",25
NA,"cede the poini of the honorable member,",25
NA,but I again remind him that the British,25
NA,contribution is approximately half of,25
NA,that which is proposed in this bill. The,25
NA,Page scheme proposed a pension of 20s.,25
NA,for both man and wife. The pension for,25
NA,widows under this hill is to be 12s. 6d. a,25
NA,"week, plus 3s. 6d. for a child, making a",25
NA,"total of 16s. That will apply until 1944,",25
NA,"when a slight increase will be made, but",25
NA,for our purposes we must take it as it,25
NA,"stands to-day. Under the British scheme,",25
NA,"the pension for a. widow is 10s., plus 5s.",25
NA,"for the first child, and 3s. for the second",25
NA,child. Whereas under the Australian,25
NA,scheme the widow with one child would,25
NA,"get 16s. a week, the widow with one child",25
NA,in England gets 15s. for half the con-,25
NA,tribution. The scheme proposed by Sir,25
NA,Earle Page was for a widow's pension of,25
NA,20s. so long as her child was under six-,25
NA,teen years of age. That is something,25
NA,similar to the provision in the widows',25
NA,pension scheme which operates in New,25
NA,South Wales. I have already brought,25
NA,"forward facts, exact in every detail, to",25
NA,show that this scheme in respect of,25
NA,national health is completely out of pro-,25
NA,"portion, but what I am now about to",25
NA,state shows an even more glaring dis-,25
NA,proportion in respect of pensions. The,25
NA,Australian scheme is for an orphan's,25
NA,pension of 7s. 6d. a week for each child.,25
NA,The British scheme provides for 7s. 6d.,25
NA,"for the first child, and 6s. for the second.",25
NA,The figures which I have supplied to the,25
NA,House should convince honorable mem-,25
NA,bers that the claims of generosity by the,25
NA,"Government can be discounted, and that",25
NA,it is trying to amass a reserve,25
NA,"which will, I hope, enable it to",25
NA,give additional benefits in the future.,25
NA,"The Government should not, however, try",25
NA,to establish a reserve at the expense of,25
NA,the general scheme itself. I suggest that,25
NA,it should give consideration to the health,26
NA,side of this matter. The figures,26

NA,"In parenthesis, at this stage, I must say",26
NA,that out of the welter of accusation and,26
NA,denial that has marked the negotiations,26
NA,between the executive of the British,26
NA,Medical Association and tbe Treasurer,26
NA,came some clear indication that there was,26
NA,some agreement between the British Medi-,26
NA,cal Association and the Treasurer. There,26
NA,is not a scintilla of evidence to prove,26
NA,otherwise. Whether the doctors came to,26
NA,discussions with plenary powers is not a,26
NA,maiter for the Government; it is a domes-,26
NA,tic matter for the British Medical Associa-,26
NA,tion itself. I do not base my case on the,26
NA,desire of the doctors for greater remunera-,26
NA,"tion. I want to see justice done, but I",26
NA,deplore the fact that so much propa-,26
NA,ganda has been used by learned and effi-,26
NA,cient men who should know better. They,26
NA,do not make their case one bit better by,26
NA,endeavouring to use duress through the,26
NA,despatch of threatening telegrams to hon-,26
NA,orable members of this House. I f they,26
NA,have a case they would get a better hear-,26

NA,Government should set up a court of,26
NA,inquiry to enable the rank and file,26
NA,of medical practitioners to state their,26
NA,"views, for I firmly believe that owing",26
NA,to the secrecy that has been observed,26
NA,Ihey have not yet had an adequate oppor-,26
NA,tunity to do so. An inquiry of this kind,26
NA,should be held before this bill is placed,26
NA,on the statute-book. The result would,26
NA,be either to strengthen the attitude of,26
NA,the Government or to cause it to amend,26
NA,the provision of the bill in order to deal,26
NA,more fairly with the local practitioners.,26
NA,t I shall summarize my reason for sub-,26
NA,mitting that the case of the doctors should,26
NA,be reconsidered. Under the British,26
NA,scheme a doctor gets 9s. for his medical,26
NA,service.,26
Mr HAWKER,Tha t is equal to l i s . 3d.,26
NA,in our currency.,26
NA,"Mr HARRISON"" - That is true.",26
NA,I was coming to that. If a,26
NA,considerable discrepancy is apparent,26
NA,in the real value of the remuneration of,26
NA,tlic British practitioners as against that,26
NA,proposed for the practitioners of this,26
NA,"country, it should be rectified. Increased",26
NA,benefits are being provided under our bill,27
NA,"it is true, but increased contributions are",27
NA,being charged. I n any case the discre-,27
NA,pancy between English and Australian,27
NA,currency has been considered by the,27
NA,Government in drafting sickness and pen-,27
NA,sion benefits. I n every instance they,27
NA,have increased the value of the benefits,27
NA,as compared with the British scheme.,27
NA,"Every benefit under this scheme, except",27
NA,"that in respect of the doctors, is based",27
NA,on the discrepancy of money values be-,27
NA,tween Great Britain and Australia. The,27
NA,payment of 9s. under the British scheme,27
NA,is equivalent to l i s . 3d. Australian.,27
NA,the British payment is regarded as satis-,27
NA,factory-whic h is doubtful-a t least all,27
NA,the circumstances should be taken into,27
NA,consideration in fixing the payment for,27
NA,Australian practitioners. The amount,27
NA,"was considered, so we were told, in rela-",27
NA,tion to the payments by friendly societies,27
NA,"to doctors for medical services, but we",27
NA,must not overlook the opinion held in,27
NA,some quarters that the doctors were,27
NA,dispensing some form of charity in mak-,27
NA,ing an agreement of this nature,27
NA,with the friendly societies. Other,27
NA,aspects of the subject also demand con-,27
NA,sideration. We pride ourselves in Aus-,27
NA,tralia on our high standard of living. I,27
NA,say without hesitation that our standard,27
NA,"is from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, higher",27
NA,than that of Great Britain. This natu-,27
NA,rally entails increased demands upon our,27
NA,"medical practitioners, and that should be",27
NA,borne in mind in determining the remu-,27
NA,neration to be provided. Another factor,27
NA,to be considered is the incidence of the,27
NA,tariff. Our medical practitioners are,27
NA,affected by the tariff in connexion with,27
NA,the purchase of instruments and other,27
NA,supplies. Even if it be said that medical,27
NA,instruments are not subject to high tariff,27
NA,it cannot be denied that other medical,27
NA,"supplies, and all sterilizing apparatus, i3",27
NA,so affected. Seeing that other sections of,27
NA,the community receive consideration in,27
NA,respect of the effects of the tariff upon,27
NA,"them, the medical profession is entitled",27
NA,to similar consideration.,27
NA,A widened medical service is being pro-,27
NA,vided under this bill compared with that,27
NA,provided under the British scheme. Thi3,27
NA,also should ho borne in mind. We have,27
NA,"heard a good deal, favorable and other-",27
NA,"wise, in the course of the debate about",27
NA,Mr Harrison.,27
NA,the British panel system. I do not wish,27
NA,to be involved in this argument. I,27
NA,simply say that we pride ourselves upon,27
NA,our higher standard of medical practice.,27
NA,Under this scheme local medical practi-,27
NA,tioners will be required to set fractured,27
NA,limbs and perform minor operations.,27
NA,Such service is not given by practitioners,27
NA,under the British scheme.,27
NA,In all these circumstances the,27
NA,payment of something under 3d. a week,27
NA,"to Australian practitioners i3, in",27
NA,"my opinion, quite inadequate. The",27
NA,I f success of this scheme must rest almost,27
NA,entirely upon a contented and satisfied,27
NA,medical profession Who in the giving of,27
NA,"this service should not be obliged, as I",27
NA,"observed earlier, to descend to ""playing",27
NA,the panel and punting the rareties into,27
NA,"touch"". We should do our utmost to",27
NA,ensure an efficient and satisfactory medi-,27
NA,cal service to the general public. Any,27
NA,departure from this standard must affect,27
NA,the ultimate cost of sickness and disable-,27
NA,ment benefits. Conditions should be such,27
NA,as would allow the medical profession,27
NA,to carry out its responsibility to insured,27
NA,"persons in the best possible spirit. I f ,",27
NA,"in consequence of inadequate service,",27
NA,insured persons are sent to hospitals in,27
NA,"undue numbers, a much higher expense",27
NA,will be incurred by governments and other,27
NA,authorities in regard to sickness and dis-,27
NA,ablement. I t would be economic wisdom,27
NA,"for the Government to ensure, in every",27
NA,"reasonable way, a satisfied medical pro-",27
NA,"fession, which would have an incentive to",27
NA,render the best possible service under,27
NA,the bill.,27
NA,The friendly society aspect of the,27
NA,scheme merits careful consideration. I,27
NA,understand that in arriving at the pro-,27
NA,posed remuneration of the medical pro-,27
NA,fession the 3.2 family unit has been used.,27
NA,"As I have already pointed out, about",27
NA,"1,100,000 single persons and 700,000",27
NA,married persons will come under the,27
NA,scheme. But it must be borne in mind,27
NA,that the proportion of single and married,27
NA,members of friendly societies is nothing,27
NA,like so great as this. I n actual fact the,27
NA,doctors are now receiving 26s. for single,27
NA,and married persons for a service which,27
NA,they will hereafter be expected to render,27
NA,for l i s . in respect of single persons. All,27
NA,these factors lead me to reiterate my,27
NA,request for the constitution of a court,28
NA,of inquiry.,28
NA,[Leave to continue given.],28
NA,I commend the Government for its,28
NA,decision to introduce legislation at an,28
NA,early date to make provision for the wives,28
NA,"and children of insured men, but I would",28
NA,ask i t to include a scheme to provide,28
NA,for the destitute section of our com-,28
NA,munity. This matter should be taken,28
NA,up with the State governments. The,28
NA,Commonwealth should make i t a,28
NA,condition precedent to further grants,28
NA,"to the States for relief purposes,",28
NA,that the State governments should con-,28
NA,tribute a lump sum to the national in-,28
NA,surance f u n d to enable medical benefits,28
NA,to be given to destitute persons unable,28
NA,to fend for themselves.,28
NA,Another aspect of the subject calls f o r,28
NA,particularly close attention.,28
NA,considerable time now the,28
NA,"Minister, the ex-Minister for Health",28
NA,"( Mr Hughes), other members of this",28
NA,"Government, and also the Premiers and",28
NA,Ministers for Health i n the various States,28
NA,have stressed the necessity to make greater,28
NA,provision for the welfare of women and,28
NA,"children, the preservation of family life,",28
NA,and the extension of maternal welfare,28
NA,measures. The right honorable member,28
NA,for N o r t h Sydney ( Mr Hughes) has,28
NA,made some impassioned speeches on this,28
NA,subject. A t the meetings of the National,28
NA,Health and Medical Research Council,28
NA,last year he was particularly emphatic.,28
NA,He pointed out that i f the present trends,28
NA,continued the population of Australia,28
NA,"would become stagnant, i n 1968, at",28
NA,"9.000,000, and subsequently gradually",28
NA,decline. He said that i t was very neces-,28
NA,sary that more attention should be paid,28
NA,to maternal welfare and that the Govern-,28
NA,ment should use every nerve and strain,28
NA,every sinew to increase its services in,28
NA,this respect. Yet clause 68 of this bill,28
NA,provides that no sickness or disablement,28
NA,"benefit shall, be provided for an insured",28
NA,woman after a certain stipulated period,28
NA,"from confinement; this, of course, covers",28
NA,the married Avoman i n industry. The,28
NA,clause reads-,28
NA,An insured woman snail not lie entitled to,28
NA,sickness benefit or disablement benefit for a,28
NA,period of four weeks after her confinement,28
NA,unless she is incapacitated by a disease or,28
NA,disablement not connected directly or indirectly,28
NA,with her confinement.,28
NA,The provision is thrown into greater,28
NA,relief when compared with that contained,28
NA,i n clause 50 (1) which reads-,28
NA,A person shall not be disqualified from,28
NA,receiving medical benefit under this act by,28
NA,reason that his sickness has been caused by,28
NA,his own mi=conduct.,28
NA,This seems to me to show a preference io,28
NA,persons who have contracted venereal,28
NA,disease as against the mothers of this,28
NA,country. That is an extraordinary situa-,28
NA,tion. I n this connexion I direct attention,28
NA,to the following resolution of the National,28
NA,Health and Medical Research Council at,28
NA,"its sessions last November, relating to",28
NA,"maternal morbidity and mortality, and",28
NA,the Prime Minister's declaration on this,28
NA,subject in his policy speech prior to the,28
NA,last elections:-,28
NA,The council notes with great satisfaction,28
NA,the reference of the Prime Minister in his,28
NA,For a policy speech in which he said-,28
NA,Prime Closely associated with the birth rate,28
NA,is the care of mothers during and after,28
NA,inaternity. Although a great deal has,28
NA,been done hy the Commonwealth in this,28
NA,"direction, much more is necessary to",28
NA,"reduce the risk attendant upon childbirth,",28
NA,and so reduce not only the mortality but,28
NA,prevent the ill-health that too frequently,28
NA,follows it.,28
NA,The Commonwealth proposes to co-,28
NA,operate actively with the States in making,28
NA,motherhood safe a<nd materially reducing,28
NA,the death-rate of infants in the first month,28
NA,of their young lives. The fall in the,28
NA,birth-rate makes these little ones and their,28
NA,mothers more than ever precious assets,28
NA,to the community.,28
NA,Under the British scheme a maternity,28
NA,allowance is provided i n return for a,28
NA,"contribution of 4 | d . a week, whereas we",28
NA,f a i l to make any provision at all. Rather,28
NA,do we aggravate the injustice by inserting,28
NA,a clause permitting a person who has been,28
NA,foolish enough to contract a grave disease,28
NA,"to receive medical benefit, while we refuse",28
NA,all aid to the mothers of the country who,28
NA,"produce, for the benefit of the community,",28
NA,"additional population, which members of",28
NA,all parties unite i n describing as our,28
NA,most precious asset. I ask the Govern-,28
NA,ment to give serious consideration to the,28
NA,"withdrawal of clause 50 ( 1 ) , or to the",28
NA,inclusion of a provision to give attention,28
NA,to ante-natal and post-natal care of the,28
NA,mothers.,28
NA,I am pleased that the Government,28
NA,proposes to introduce a measure to bring,28
NA,within the scope of the scheme small,28
NA,shopkeepers and others who are described,28
NA,as self-employed persons. I applaud the,29
NA,"Government for that, and I have made a",29
NA,"suggestion in respect to it, which I hope",29
NA,the Government will consider.,29
NA,"As for members of the Opposition, 1",29
NA,liave been pleased to observe their com-,29
NA,mendation in regard to the points I have,29
NA,"made, and I remind them that if they",29
NA,had been content to make their amend-,29
NA,"ment loss far-reaching, they might have",29
NA,had a greater chance of achieving some-,29
NA,"thing. As it is, the amendment lacks",29
NA,"logic. For instance, I heard the honor-",29
NA,able member for East Sydney ( Mr.,29
NA,Ward) refer to the whole scheme as a,29
NA,swindle. The amendment itself states-,29
NA,-' this House is Of opinion that inits present,29
NA,form the bill is unacceptable because:-,29
NA,[at it oeeks to place upon a contributory,29
NA,basis the payment of pensions for,29
NA,"iige, invalidity and widowhood, which",29
NA,should be provided ns n matter of,29
NA,right without the exaction of indi-,29
NA,"vidual contributions.""",29
NA,The Prime Minister dealt effectively with,29
NA,the attitude of the Leader of the Opposi-,29
NA,tion in relation to the report on family,29
NA,endowment. I draw the attention of,29
NA,honorable members to the fact that there,29
NA,is a report on record subscribed to by,29
NA,"three members of the Labour party, one",29
NA,of whom is on the Opposition benches at,29
NA,the present time. They said that they,29
NA,had fully investigated the invalid ancl,29
NA,old-age pensions schemes of this and,29
NA,"every other country, ancl had come to the",29
NA,c-onciusion that it was necessary to insti-,29
NA,tute a compulsory form of national health,29
NA,insurance on a contributory basis. I,29
NA,suggest that members of the Opposition,29
NA,are now running contrary to what was,29
NA,agreed io by the three Labour members,29
NA,"in that report. Surely, if a compulsory",29
NA,contributory insurance scheme was not a,29
NA,swindle when that report was being,29
NA,"incubated and produced, why should it",29
NA,assume the proportions of a swindle,29
NA,to-day? I cannot see any logic in the,29
NA,argument of the Opposition. The Leader,29
NA,nf the Opposition could not have been,29
NA,aware of the report when he committed,29
NA,"''imself to the stand he has now taken,",29
NA,nor could he have remembered the atti-,29
NA,"tude, ho himself* had taken up in regard",29
NA,to child endowment. It would be more,29
NA,logical for members of the Opposition to,29
NA,follow the lead of the Trades and Labour,29
NA,"Council in Great Britain, which has",29
NA,J/r. TTarrison.,29
NA,asked for an extension of the benefits,29
NA,"under the insurance scheme there, and",29
NA,has expressed a willingness to make in-,29
NA,creased contributions in return.,29
Mr BRENNAN ,Batman) [6.6] - 1,29
NA,clo not propose to address myself to the,29
NA,motion for the second reading of this bill,29
NA,with that large measure of detail which,29
NA,has been industriously employed by the,29
NA,honorable member for Wentworth ( Mr.,29
NA,Harrison). I t is a little difficult to focus,29
NA,criticism on the bill because the Govern-,29
NA,"ment, as is usual with decadent govern-",29
NA,"ments, is shifting its ground from day",29
NA,to day. if we may judge from the infor-,29
NA,mation made available to us from out-,29
NA,side sources. There is good reason to,29
NA,think that if this bill is ever passed-,29
NA,old and I. sincerely hope that it never may be,29
NA,"-i t will be a thing of shreds and patches,",29
NA,very unlike that measure which was,29
NA,originally presented to this House with,29
NA,so much confidence by the Treasurer ( Mr.,29
NA,"Casey). The bill is called "" a bill for an",29
NA,act to provide for insurance against cer-,29
NA,tain contingencies affecting employees and,29
NA,"the wives, children, widows, and orphan?",29
NA,"of employees, aud for other purposes."" To",29
NA,speak of the bill as in any sense pro-,29
NA,viding cover in respect of national health,29
NA,"is, of course, ridiculous presumption",29
NA,on the part of the Government. I i,29
NA,does not clo so. I t touches a compara-,29
NA,"tively few .people, and fewer still effec-",29
NA,"tively. As wo know, it excludes, up to",29
NA,"the present, at any rate, a great army of",29
NA,workers who do not come within the tech-,29
NA,nical definition of employees. The claim,29
NA,made by the Treasurer that the bill ap-,29
NA,"plies cover to 1,850,000 persons is really",29
NA,"absurd because, although potentially it",29
NA,"may apply to so large a number, we know",29
NA,perfectly well from examination of all,29
NA,"the details, that it never can, at any par-",29
NA,ticular time-havin g regard to the irre-,29
NA,"gularity of employment, and to other",29
NA,considerations-appl y to anything likr-,29
NA,the number stated.,29
NA,"As to the pensions part of the scheme,",29
NA,it is evident that pensions will be no,29
NA,"better secured than they are at present,",29
NA,"and, indeed, it may be argued that in",29
NA,pertain cases they will be less so. The,29
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin),29
NA,has moved an amendment to the motion,29
NA,for the second reading of the bill with the,29
NA,"object of making it, if possible, a better",30
NA,"bill. Well, that ought not to be hard.",30
NA,I t would be a great deal harder to make,30
NA,"it a worse bill, i f that had been the task",30
NA,he set himself. I confess that the part,30
NA,of the amendment 'which 1 like best is,30
NA,that in which it is stated that the bill is,30
NA,"unacceptable, and ought to be withdrawn.",30
NA,I like that part better than the part in,30
NA,which he suggests that it might be,30
NA,"possible to patch up the bill, and convert",30
NA,it from what it is into an effective,30
NA,measure.,30
NA,The honorable member for Griffith,30
NA,( I l r . Baker) addressed a very interesting,30
NA,argument to the House on the constitu-,30
NA,"tional aspect of the bill, and his obser-",30
NA,vations were followed later by some re-,30
NA,marks by the honorable member for War-,30
NA,ringah ( Mr Spender). This honorable,30
NA,"member was critical of the measure, and",30
NA,some said that he damned it with faint,30
NA,"praise, while the honorable member for",30
NA,Bourke ( Mr Blackburn) suggested that,30
NA,he had praised it with loud damns. I n,30
NA,"any case, I advise the honorable member",30
NA,to persevere with his criticism to the ut-,30
NA,"most, because along tbat road lies admis-",30
NA,sion to the Ministry. On this constitu-,30
NA,"tional aspect, if one had a week to spare,",30
NA,"and the inclination so to spend it, it",30
NA,might very well be that on a close,30
NA,"examination of the decided cases, and a",30
NA,"re-perusal of the Constitution, one might",30
NA,form a useful opinion as to whether the,30
NA,bill is within the constitutional powers of,30
NA,this Parliament or is not. I have neither,30
NA,the inclination nor the time for the in-,30
NA,vestigation. The bill has 188 clauses-,30
NA,at least that is the number it had when,30
NA,"I looked at it last, though we know it is",30
NA,likely to be amplified as time goes on. I n,30
NA,"addition, it has a number of formidable",30
NA,"schedules. I t may be that the bill, like",30
NA,that somewhat overdone egg which was,30
NA,"tendered to the curate, is good in parts.",30
NA,"One does not know. However, having",30
NA,regard to the spirit of adventure which,30
NA,finds expression in the High Court in our,30
NA,"day and generation, a High Court which",30
NA,not only skittles the most solemn deci-,30
NA,"sions of its predecessors, but even, inferen-",30
NA,"tially, at least, invites a foreign tribunal",30
NA,"to skittle its own decision, and remem-",30
NA,bering also that particular judgments de-,30
NA,"pend upon particular facts, and that",30
NA,the High Court itself declined some,30
NA,"years ago, to allow itself to be reduced",30
NA,to the status of an off-sider to the legis-,30
NA,"lature by deciding in an academic way,",30
NA,"from time to time, whether a particular",30
NA,bill fell within the Constitution or not-,30
NA,"having regard to all these matters, I pre-",30
NA,"fer not to take up the time of the House,",30
NA,"and my own time, in what I would regard",30
NA,as a fruitless speculation as to what the,30
NA,"High Court might, at any particular time,",30
NA,and in any particular set of cir-,30
NA,"cumstances, decide in regard to this bill.",30
NA,At present I leave responsibility where,30
NA,"it rightly belongs, and I conclude",30
NA,with a final observation on that,30
NA,phase. I f this bill should be passed,30
NA,"- I may be permitted to pray, but not",30
NA,"very hopefully, it will not be-an d if this",30
NA,very elaborate machinery-s o elaborate,30
NA,that I am inclined to describe i t as a,30
NA,steam hammer to crush a peanut-shoul d,30
NA,"be set in motion, and if, by any miracle,",30
NA,the measure should become popular with,30
NA,"the public, or alternatively, the public",30
NA,"becomes reconciled to it, and then",30
NA,at any time the High Court should,30
NA,decide that it is outside the,30
NA,"constitutional power, I shall have the con-",30
NA,"solation that a severe jolt of that nature,",30
NA,"and I think nothing less will suffice, may",30
NA,drive the electors of Australia to a sane,30
NA,and sensible amendment of the Constitu-,30
NA,"tion, such as that so long advocated by",30
NA,members of the Labour party and so,30
NA,long opposed by those opposite. I support,30
NA,the amendment moved by my Leader to,30
NA,make this a better bill as far as possible,30
NA,along lines which he indicated so ad-,30
NA,mirably in his opening speech. I join,30
NA,with him in his condemnation of the,30
NA,"major faults of the bill, but, as I have",30
NA,said. I join with him with more en-,30
NA,thusiasm in the suggestion that it should,30
NA,"be withdrawn, and in the statement that it",30
NA,is not acceptable. My reasons for oppos-,30
NA,"ing the passage of this bill and, in the",30
NA,"meantime, for supporting this amend-",30
NA,"ment, really go deeper than those indi-",30
NA,"cated, and fully expressed, by",30
NA,"my Leader and other speakers, although",30
NA,it must be said that honorable gentlemen,30
NA,on my side of the House have left little,30
NA,unsaid which ought to be uttered in con-,30
NA,demnation of the bill. Much play has,30
NA,been made upon the fact that the Labour,30
NA,party is favorable to a policy of national,30
NA,insurance.. That may be readily ad-,31
NA,"mitted, and if that were destructive",31
NA,"criticism, the argument might equally",31
NA,well be urged against the fact that Labour,31
NA,was the driving force in the great body of,31
NA,social legislation which has been adopted,31
NA,"by this country, by. this Parliament and",31
NA,by the Parliaments of the various States.,31
NA,We have supported the policy of concilia-,31
NA,"tion and arbitration; indeed, we drove",31
NA,others before us to have it put upon the,31
NA,statute-book. Wc have supported,31
NA,approved wages boards; we have asked,31
NA,for and gained safer and more,31
NA,wholesome conditions for workers in,31
NA,various avenues of employment; we,31
NA,have supported and put upon the,31
NA,"statute-book a generous policy, in some",31
NA,"parts of Australia at least, of child",31
NA,"endowment, and given some consideration",31
NA,to the condition of widowhood. We have,31
NA,passed workers' compensations acts and,31
NA,fought for them in the Parliaments of all,31
NA,the States of the Commonwealth and in,31
NA,the Commonwealth Parliament itself. And,31
NA,so on through a very long list of legisla-,31
NA,tive provisions which stand to the credit,31
NA,of Labour. Not that Labour was in power,31
NA,either in the States or in the Common-,31
NA,wealth in every case when those measures,31
NA,"became law, but Labour was, I claim, in",31
NA,"every case the constant driving force, if",31
NA,"not in the vanguard, in the movements",31
NA,to bring about those necessary reforms.,31
NA,So far from being embarrassed,31
NA,"by our opposition to this measure,",31
NA,wo say that we oppose it in,31
NA,loyalty to the principle underlying our,31
NA,activities in building up that edifice of,31
NA,achievement to which I have just re-,31
NA,"ferred. It is true that, from our view-",31
NA,point-and most definitely from my view-,31
NA,"point, because sometimes it is safer for",31
NA,rae to speak for myself than for my party,31
NA,-all social legislation of the kind I,31
NA,have mentioned is merely ameliorative in,31
NA,"character. It is, frankly, patchwork. We",31
NA,"have proceeded on the theory of "" one step",31
NA,"enough "" for the time being, for the "" dis-",31
NA,"tant scene "" is still apparently a very",31
NA,"tant scene; still, we live on and work on",31
NA,in hopes. But the fact is that none,31
NA,of these measures to which I have made,31
NA,"reference, or the measures necessary for",31
NA,"their fulfilment, is comparable to the",31
NA,measure now before the chamber. The,31
NA,Mr Brennan.,31
NA,"outstanding point, to my mind, is that",31
NA,"this bill, which professes in its words aud",31
NA,"through its professor, the Treasurer, to",31
NA,"be a measure of social uplift, is really",31
NA,a measure for taxing the working classes.,31
NA,I t -would enforce upon them what the,31
NA,Acting Minister for Commerce ( Mr.,31
NA,"Archie Cameron), in a burst of candour",31
NA,"in his own speech, described as "" com-",31
NA,"pulsory saving "". Others on the Govern-",31
NA,ment side have said that it is an encour-,31
NA,"agement to thrift and, with almost",31
NA,unendurable imitating patronage some of,31
NA,them have added that it would enable the,31
NA,working class to maintain its self-respect.,31
NA,"That, I think, is admirable. When my",31
NA,honorable friends opposite with tongue,31
NA,in the cheek havefinishedwith these pious,31
NA,platitudes hoping thus to salve their own,31
NA,"consciences, they have not altered the",31
NA,fundamental truth that this bill is to,31
NA,be employed as an instrument for extract-,31
NA,"ing millions of pounds, willy-nilly, out of",31
NA,the pockets of the working classes in this,31
NA,"community. That, surely, is everything.",31
NA,Mr HOI.T -Doe s the honorable mem-,31
NA,ber consider it extraction to take a,31
NA,shilling and give five shillings in return?,31
Mr BRENNAN ,Th e honorable,31
NA,"member will, perhaps, allow me to take",31
NA,"the points one at a time, so that the",31
NA,issue may not be confused. My present,31
NA,"point \n that this bill, which comes with",31
NA,fluttering wings as though it were an,31
NA,"angel ami a messenger of mercy, is, in",31
NA,"fact, the harbinger of that essential fact",31
NA,that by force the bill proposes to take,31
NA,millions of pounds out of the pockets of,31
NA,the working classes without consulting,31
NA,them. I t is like every other class of,31
NA,taxation. What arc all classes of taxation,31
NA,designed to do? They are designed for,31
NA,"the betterment of the whole community,",31
NA,but especially for the uplift of the work-,31
NA,ing class.,31
NA,Mi . Tiioirrso' -Th e workers will get,31
NA,-,31
NA,millions back.,31
NA,i l r . BRENNAN -Som e of them will,31
NA,"get something back, others will get a",31
NA,"dis- little back, and many more will get noth-",31
NA,ing back. Their money will be confis-,31
NA,"cated and, indeed, the very fact that",31
NA,it is being confiscated is one of the,31
NA,foundations and guarantees of the sol-,31
NA,vency of this measure. This money will,31
NA,be taken from the pockets of men,31
NA,"employed at subsistence rates of pay who,",31
NA,it must be remembered and insisted on.,32
NA,are tbe best-off class of the workers.,32
NA,They are those who are regularly,32
NA,"employed, those who have the benefit of",32
NA,"arbitration awards, wages boards awards",32
NA,or some other kinds of award regulating,32
NA,their rates of pay and the conditions of,32
NA,their employment. Their rate of pay is,32
NA,based upon the principle of what is neces-,32
NA,sary to maintain them-no t what will,32
NA,"enable them to save for their wives, their",32
NA,"families or their children or for sickness,",32
NA,"or to provide for a rainy day, but what",32
NA,"will maintain them and, I suggest, main-",32
NA,tain them at a working standard so that,32
NA,they can do their toil from day to day.,32
NA,This is taxation inasmuch as this money,32
NA,"is to be taken from, that subsistence wage",32
NA,and will reduce that bare subsistence,32
NA,"wage. I t is a tax, and a tax of a kind",32
NA,"which, as lias more than once been pointed",32
NA,"out in this chamber, disregards the ele-",32
NA,"mentary canon of taxation, namely, thai",32
NA,it should be imposed according to ability,32
NA,"to pay. In that aspect it is not a gift,",32
NA,it is a. talcing away; in that aspect it is,32
NA,"not a benefit, it is a burden. I f that be",32
NA,"so of the bost-off of the working classes,",32
NA,men regularly employed at what is called,32
NA,a living wage according to those,32
NA,"standards, how about that mounting army",32
NA,"of the worse-off who, if they are unem-",32
NA,"ployed long enough, will certainly lose all",32
NA,benefits because this bill salts their,32
NA,wounds of unemployment by telling them,32
NA,that sufficient unemployment will qualify,32
NA,thorn to lose everything they have paid,32
NA,"in under this scheme? I know people,",32
NA,"as I am sure honorable members do,",32
NA,"certainly those on this side of the House,",32
NA,"who have been unemployed for years, and",32
NA,have no hope of being employed again.,32
Mr THOMPSON ,The y arc unemplov-,32
NA,ablt-.,32
NA,i l r . BRENNAN - I absolutely deny,32
NA,that. Whom does the Minister describe,32
NA,"as ""unemployable?"" Would he regard",32
NA,men of 45 years of age who lose their,32
NA,"employment in factories in which, np",32
NA,"rill then, they had spent the whole of",32
NA,"their working lives, and cannot find other",32
NA,employment? I f they were unemployable,32
NA,in the sense meant by the honorable,32
NA,"gentleman, they would probably be",32
NA,employable in some other occupation.,32
NA,They are no less deserving of,32
NA,"security than are those who, from",32
NA,"his viewpoint, are employable.",32
NA,Industrial tribunals will not be able to,32
NA,make any concessions to the employee in,32
NA,respect of this sum which isto be,32
NA,deducted from the amount necessary for,32
NA,his daily existence. A sufficient reason,32
NA,is that the employer also will have to con-,32
NA,tribute to the fund. But there i3 another,32
NA,good reason of which the Government did,32
NA,not lose sight when it drew up this bill.,32
NA,I t is contained in clause 1S5 of the,32
NA,"measure, which forbids a tribunal",32
NA,making any allowance to the advantage of,32
NA,an employee on the ground that he has,32
NA,been compelled to contribute tlm sum,32
NA,out of-his weekly wage.,32
Mr HOLLOWAY , I thought that the,32
NA,policy of the Government was not to,32
NA,interfere with the courts.,32
NA,"Mr BRENNAN"" -Tha t is a point",32
NA,which is well worth stating. I n commit-,32
NA,tee we shall have an opportunity to,32
NA,examine this clause more closely.,32
NA,One of the many fallacies which under-,32
NA,lie this policy of taxation for a compul-,32
NA,sory saving is the supposition that ali,32
NA,who are on a given wage are equally able,32
NA,to save. They are not. The extent of,32
NA,individual obligation cannot be assessed,32
NA,"by the Government, or, for that matter,",32
NA,"by any tribunal. The power to save, ancl",32
NA,the nature and variety of the obligations,32
NA,"which press on an individual, vary in",32
NA,a thousand ways in different circum-,32
NA,stances. These are not within the know,32
NA,"ledge of the Government, and cannot be",32
NA,within the knowledge of anyone except,32
NA,the person who shoulders those,32
NA,obligations.,32
NA,I t is but fair to say that the bill penal-,32
NA,izes certain employers as well as,32
NA,employees. Although the Government is,32
NA,not adamant when the pressure comes,32
NA,"from the right quarter, the fact cannot",32
NA,bo gainsaid that so far the scheme leaves,32
NA,out of account the fact that those who,32
NA,earn the largest incomes employ very few,32
NA,"persons, and in many cases noiuf at all,",32
NA,whilst those who employ a large number,32
NA,of hands may themselves be in very,32
NA,serious difficulty. Yet the full measure,32
NA,of contributions i3 exacted in proportion,32
NA,"to employment. "" I t is to be noted, also,",32
NA,that the difficulties under which an,32
NA,employer in the latter class labours will,32
NA,be increased and exacerbated by this,32
NA,measure.,32
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Th e more persons a,33
NA,"man employs, the more will he pay.",33
Mr BRENNAN,Th e honorable,33
NA,member for Dalley ( Mr Rosevear) cited,33
NA,the very pointed example of the person,33
NA,"who draws revenues from slum properties,",33
NA,thus making a contribution to the general,33
NA,ill-health of the community but no con-,33
NA,tribution whatever to the fund from,33
NA,which these pensions and relief payments,33
NA,are to be made from time to time. Of,33
NA,"course, that individual is only one of a",33
NA,large number of persons who enjoy big,33
NA,incomes and yet are entirely immune,33
NA,from the necessity to contribute to the,33
NA,"proposed fund. There is, for example,",33
NA,"the landowner, who frequently is the",33
NA,"largest monopolist, yet, by no means is a",33
NA,large employer of labour. There are the,33
NA,men who follow my profession. The,33
NA,honorable member for Ballarat ( Mr.,33
NA,Pollard) made a merciful distinction,33
NA,"between members of the bar, some of",33
NA,"whom draw a very large income, and",33
NA,us general practitioners who employ,33
NA,clerks and draw a less handsome income.,33
NA,There are also the medical fraternity and,33
NA,"the stockbrokers, and a long list of others,,",33
NA,who enjoy large incomes and are not detri-,33
NA,mentally affected by this measure.,33
NA,When the Treasurer speaks of the,33
NA,Government subvention being very,33
NA,large-whic h it undoubtedly is-,33
NA,one would think that he was paying,33
NA,"it out of his own ample resources, with",33
NA,such unction does he address himself to,33
NA,"that phase. I n fact, the payments",33
NA,are to be made out of Consoli-,33
NA,"dated Revenue, and consequently out of",33
NA,"money derived from indirect taxation,",33
NA,the bulk of which is paid by the working,33
NA,class.,33
Mr HARRISON ,Doe s none of it come,33
NA,from direct taxation?,33
Mr BRENNAN , A relatively small,33
NA,"proportion. The expression ""contribu-",33
NA,"tory "" is an attractive one, but i t is more",33
NA,usually associated with voluntary gifts,33
NA,than with exactions of this kind; and,33
NA,"in this case the exaction, as I have",33
NA,"already pointed out, is a double one. The",33
NA,tax is not to be imposed in any sense,33
NA,"upon the surplus income of the employee,",33
NA,but is to be taken from an income no par!,33
NA,of which can be given up without the,33
NA,"worker forfeiting, to the detriment of his",33
NA,"wife and family, some portion of that",33
NA,which is necessary for their maintenance,33
NA,-mone y which is there and then needed,33
NA,in order to procure the necessaries of life.,33
NA,I t has been suggested that at some future,33
NA,time the nation may be unable to meet,33
NA,the pensions bill. This is the first occa-,33
NA,sion on which I have heard it seriously,33
NA,"argued, in this Parliament or elsewhere,",33
NA,that a guarantee backed by the total re-,33
NA,"sources of the Commonwealth, is",33
NA,inadequate for any purpose. The,33
NA,particular illustration given by some,33
NA,speakers on the other side of the House,33
NA,was a very unfortunate one. I t has been,33
NA,correctly stated that during the regime,33
NA,of the Scullin Government invalid and,33
NA,old-age pensions were reduced. I am glad,33
NA,to embrace this opportunity-i t is not,33
NA,"the first, and presumably it will not be",33
NA,the last-t o state publicly that I have,33
NA,"never admitted, much less contended, that",33
NA,at that time the circumstances of this,33
NA,country justified the reduction of pen-,33
NA,"sions. The composition of the legislature,",33
NA,"and not the circumstances of this country,",33
NA,was the cause which led to the reduction,33
NA,of pensions. They were reduced as the,33
NA,result of perfectly dishonest pressure on,33
NA,the part of a dishonest minority in and,33
NA,outside the legislature over which the Go-,33
NA,vernment had no control. I should regard,33
NA,"it as blasphemy, in the circumstances, to",33
NA,"say that this country could not, out of its",33
NA,"ample resources, have made the necessary",33
NA,contribution for the maintenance of its,33
NA,old-aged and invalid. As a matter of fact,33
NA,"it was a period of great abundance, not of",33
NA,"want; and unless this Government, or",33
NA,"some other government similarly disposed,",33
NA,should plunge this country into a foreign,33
NA,conflict which may result in our forfeit-,33
NA,"ing our birthright, there never can come",33
NA,a time when we shall not be able to make,33
NA,provision for those who have the first,33
NA,"claim on our bounty or our justice,",33
NA,"namely, the old-aged, the invalid and the",33
NA,"helpless. Any submission to the contrary,",33
NA,"I submit, either is the merest pretence or",33
NA,it arises from invincible ignorance and,33
NA,failure to see obvious facts. I,33
NA,think i± is a good deal more,33
NA,pretence than ignorance on the part of,33
NA,those who persist in the argument that,33
NA,the money token is of more importance,33
NA,than the real wealth of the country.,33
NA,What proof have we that the present,33
NA,scheme can be financed in aU circum-,34
NA,"stances? What guarantee is there that if,",34
NA,"in the future, as, unhappily, seems likely,",34
NA,we find ourselves in the trough of a de-,34
NA,pression similar to that which afflicted,34
NA,"us before, notwithstanding that the land",34
NA,"was overflowing with milk and honey, the",34
NA,Government will not cut down the benefits,34
NA,that contributors to this scheme are,34
NA,guaranteed? As was pointed out by the,34
NA,honorable member for Bourke ( Mr.,34
NA,"Blackburn), there was no hesitancy about",34
NA,reducing the benefits of superannuation,34
NA,when that general scheme of ruthless cut-,34
NA,ring was i n force. From many jioints of,34
NA,"view, the benefits to be derived under this",34
NA,"measure will be precariously held, and,",34
NA,"in any ease, they will be slight. They",34
NA,cannot be assured to more than an un-,34
NA,certain proportion of those who set out,34
NA,lightheartedly in the belief that they will,34
NA,travel the whole long road from sixteen,34
NA,years of age to the time when they,34
NA,qualify for the old-age pension. When,34
NA,"the present Government came into power,",34
NA,just as the country was emerging from,34
NA,"the depression, it took credit for the im-",34
NA,"proved state of affairs, indeed, going so",34
NA,far as to claim that it was lifting the,34
NA,world out of the depression by the con-,34
NA,fidence that it inspired; it continued,34
NA,"i ho slashing of pensions, and added",34
NA,mortgaging the property of pen-,34
NA,sioners and introduced other harsh,34
NA,measures. Have we any reason to sup-,34
NA,poso that the present Government would,34
NA,act differently in the future? I have no,34
NA,"reason to think that it would clo so, for",34
NA,I have uot heard a single word of,34
NA,"repentance, or regret, for what it did",34
NA,then. The Government never seems to,34
NA,"learn by experience. Moreover, the pen-",34
NA,"sion benefit, even under this scheme as",34
NA,"interpreted literally, may be lost after a",34
NA,comparatively short spell of unemploy-,34
NA,"ment, and may not be regained until a fur-",34
NA,ther term of employment has expired. I t,34
NA,U to be remembered also that the orphan's,34
NA,"pension and, what is, perhaps, more im-",34
NA,"portant, the widow's pension, are",34
NA,dependent upon the qualification of the,34
NA,employee. They hang one from the other,34
NA,like ?- string of sausages. I f the string,34
NA,"is cut at the top, down fall all",34
NA,"the benefits. I f employment fails,",34
NA,"if sickness becomes chronic, the Goveru-",34
NA,ment. has nothing to propose. Tn such,34
NA,"circumstances, the Government washes its",34
NA,hands of tho whole business.,34
NA,[Leave to continue given.],34
NA,I t is on account of this dishonest,34
NA,"jugglery with the monetary system,",34
NA,that the wage-earner lives in con-,34
NA,stant dread of unemployment. For,34
NA,that the bill makes no provision what-,34
NA,ever: the House has already decided that,34
NA,"issue. By reason of orthodox finance,",34
NA,"as it is called, but which ,1 call",34
NA,the make-belief as to the capacity,34
NA,"of the nation to pay, the system",34
NA,wliich makes millionaires by the dozen,34
NA,"and paupers by the many thousands, the",34
NA,worker cannot provide for sickness in,34
NA,respect of either himself or the members,34
NA,"of his family. Indeed, his poor condition",34
NA,of health is often aggravated and intensi-,34
NA,fied by the mental condition of anxiety,34
NA,and apprehension. Add to that,34
NA,"the burden of debt, the pressure",34
NA,"of creditors, and the fact that his",34
NA,"family is inadequately housed and clothed,",34
NA,it all reacts eventually upon the health of,34
NA,"the employee. To those who say, "" Very",34
NA,"well, that being the lot of the worker, it",34
NA,is well to agree to this small exaction,34
NA,from his wages when he is in. work in,34
NA,order that he may have something in,34
NA,"his old-age, or provide some pension to",34
NA,"his widow, of some little contribution to",34
NA,"his children"", my answer is that only a",34
NA,few among the workers can save,34
NA,"money, and that those who are in a posi-",34
NA,tion to become contributors to this scheme,34
NA,"save it now. There are, of course,",34
NA,"exceptions, and they also, by the way, are",34
NA,largely the creatures of a defective social,34
NA,system. The fact remains that a great,34
NA,majority of those who are able to save,34
NA,for the inevitable rainy day do save. I,34
NA,have always found a readiness on,34
NA,the part of the working man to invest his,34
NA,"savings in acquiring a home for himself,",34
NA,and providing a roof over his children's,34
NA,beads. That applies to those who are in,34
NA,"a position to save, :and, therefore, it.",34
NA,applies to those who are in a position to,34
NA,"pay under this scheme. Moreover, the",34
NA,more fortunate few will avail themselves,34
NA,of the existing machinery of the friendly,34
NA,societies-association s of persons who are,34
NA,rightly anxious as to the effect of this,34
NA,"legislation upon them, and to whom the",34
NA,community as a Avhole is deeply indebted,34
NA,-an d of the trade unions: and i f they,34
NA,"can still save money, they will put it into",35
NA,the savings hank. The fact that such,35
NA,"cases, instead of being the universal rule,",35
NA,"are exceptional, is entirely due to the",35
NA,outrageous social maldistribution,35
NA,"uuder which we live, aud not",35
NA,to the absence of any,35
NA,"pawky, herring-gutted, attenuated pen-",35
NA,sion scheme as that which we are now,35
NA,"considering. Once we set up, under the",35
NA,"aegis of a statute, the principle that it is",35
NA,the duty of the poor to maintain the poor,35
NA,and the privilege of the rich to avoid,35
NA,"taxation, we entrench as a legalized",35
NA,system that which was hitherto regarded,35
NA,"as nothing more than a shameful abuse,",35
NA,ancl to the claims of all future reformers,35
NA,"there will be one answer, "" You have your",35
NA,"national insurance.""",35
NA,The honorable member for Parra-,35
NA,matta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) was,35
NA,amusing when he spoke of the defects and,35
NA,imperfections of the existing pensions,35
NA,legislation. He cited a number of those,35
NA,"imperfections, and then turned to the",35
NA,members of the Opposition and inquired,35
NA,whether they thought that that was the,35
NA,kind of legislation that should remain.,35
NA,My answer to that is that it is competent,35
NA,for the honorable member for Parra-,35
NA,"matta, and those who support him, to",35
NA,amend the existing pensions legislation,35
NA,with the hearty support of every member,35
NA,of the Opposition at any moment they,35
NA,like to make the attempt. I do not deny,35
NA,that a pension of 12s. 6d. a week is better,35
NA,than nothing. Nor do I deny that those,35
NA,"who will be privileged to "" enjoy"" the",35
NA,"sick benefit or the disablement benefit,",35
NA,"as it is, will welcome it. Neither can it",35
NA,be denied that if a person buys no bread,35
NA,and butter this week he will have twice,35
NA,as much to spend on bread and butter,35
NA,next week. Although it remains true,35
NA,"that "" man doe3 not live by bread alone,""",35
NA,it remains equally true that bread is a,35
NA,commodity which is required for daily,35
NA,"use, and not for intermittent or occasional",35
NA,use. That applies to the necessaries of,35
NA,life generally. I am familiar with the,35
NA,Treasurer's theory that the old are living,35
NA,"longer, and that there is a regrettable",35
NA,hesitancy to increase the population. I,35
NA,"am aware also of his prognostication that,",35
NA,"if we continue, as at present, we shall be",35
NA,involved in an expenditure of millions of,35
NA,"pounds annually--£30,000,000 in a few",35
NA,Mr Brennan.,35
NA,years-i n respect of pensions. I was,35
NA,favorably impressed by the speech of the,35
NA,honorable member for Ballarat ( Mr.,35
NA,"Pollard), who pointed out that these",35
NA,prognostications were fallacious.,35
NA,They are in any case of doubtful,35
NA,such value. They remind one of the,35
NA,lines of argument familiar to Malthus,35
NA,"in his day, ancl he is not now accepted as",35
NA,a reliable authority on economies. When,35
NA,the Treasurer spoke about this natural,35
NA,"progression to disaster, he put himself on",35
NA,the same footing as the statistician who,35
NA,"estimates that if for the next 1,000 year?",35
NA,our population increases at the same rare,35
NA,"as it has been during the last ten years,",35
NA,it woidd follow that there will not be,35
NA,enough space on the face of Australia for,35
NA,"the population to stand, let alone to lie",35
NA,"down. But, in any case, having",35
NA,regard to our vast resources and what our,35
NA,friends opposite are pleased to call our,35
NA,"exportable surplus of wool and foodstuffs,",35
NA,I reject with scorn and contempt the out-,35
NA,worn theory that it is beyond the wit of,35
NA,man to bring these ample resources within,35
NA,practical reach of the people who require,35
NA,them. I know how inveterate is the,35
NA,"doctrine of possession, and the legal right,",35
NA,of spoliation; but evil gains nothing in,35
NA,"respectability from age, and hypocrisy",35
NA,does not mellow into sincerity with the,35
NA,flight of time.,35
NA,With regard to the inequality of men's,35
NA,"and women's pensions, I point out that",35
NA,"the Government proposes, by this bill, to",35
NA,take away from woman what the legis-,35
NA,lature deliberately conceded to her many,35
NA,such years ago when the pensions legislation,35
NA,was passed. We remembered then the dis-,35
NA,abilities attaching to her sex-th e fact,35
NA,"that she was a widow, in many cases-",35
NA,and wc recall the fact that it,35
NA,shocked the conscience of the times,35
NA,that she should be asked to,35
NA,compete in the industrial welter. None,35
NA,of these things has affected this,35
NA,"Government, which cuts down her",35
NA,"pension with singular lack of chivalry,",35
NA,"and even of decency. This Government,",35
NA,"it is said, has yielded, under pros-",35
NA,"sure, certain important concessions which",35
NA,its own sense of fitness never suggested.,35
NA,The claims of a wife and children to,35
NA,"medical benefits, and the proposed inclu-",35
NA,sion of certain classes of workers who are,35
NA,"not employees, are, as the result of a",35
NA,"barrage of criticism, to be considered",36
NA,others. We shall have further opporbest,36
NA,tunities to discuss these points when,36
NA,bill is in the committee stage.,36
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,Henty),36
NA,"16.53---"" - have listened with"" much",36
NA,pleasure to the remarks of my friend,36

NA,suggestive of the barren political record,36
NA,of honorable members opposite. To,36
NA,"mind it is a mean amendment, purely",36
NA,"partisan and destructive, the sole objecchildren",36
NA,tive being to mar and break the,36

NA,"With the exception of two years, a",36
NA,of about 22 years has elapsed since,36

NA,20 of those years it has not written one,36
NA,"line upon the statute-book, nor contributed",36
NA,to the writing of one line in aid of,36
NA,workers whom it is alleged to represent. ment officials.,36
NA,The present attitude of the Opposition,36
NA,that of the dog in the manger-i t can,36
NA,do nothing for the working man whom,36
NA,"it comes here to represent, and, i f possible,",36
NA,it will prevent honorable members on,36

Mr MAHONEY ,Wha t has the honoralmost,36
NA,able member done for the working man?,36
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,Anythin,36
NA,done in this Parliament during the last,36
NA,20 years has been accomplished by the terial,36
NA,party on this side -,36
NA,Out of that simple truth comes,36
NA,the spirit and the matter of the benefits.,36
NA,"amendment, and I shall vote against",36
NA,it with all the contempt of which I am,36
NA,"capable. As I do not take it seriously,",36
NA,I shall not waste much time in discussing,36
NA,"it. I pass on to the bill, for the second",36
NA,reading of which I shall vote whole-,36
NA,with heartedly. I regard this measure as the,36
NA,essay at social advance since the,36
NA,the inception of federation. I t is true that,36
NA,"the scheme is not a complete one, but no",36
NA,measure providing for national insurance,36
NA,has been complete upon its introduction.,36
NA,the This measure has been - described as an,36
NA,"instalment only, and some honorable",36
NA,"members, including the honorable mem-",36
NA,"ber for Batman, have called it a despicable",36
NA,"instalment. Yet i t is a great measure,",36
NA,as it will ensure medical treatment for,36
NA,"1,500,000 more working people of both",36
NA,sexes than is provided at the present time.,36
NA,honAlso it provides those who are insured,36
NA,with financial aid during sickne3s and,36
NA,any disablement period which may,36
NA,follow; benefits will be available to the,36
NA,children of the insured during the latter's,36
NA,my sickness and disablement. The scheme,36
NA,provides a rjension for widows and their,36
NA,"up to the age of fifteen years, and",36
NA,bill. One orphans are not overlooked.,36
NA,The old-age pension is to be placed,36
NA,period upon an entirely new basis. We have,36
NA,the been told that something is to be taken,36
NA,"for away under this measure, but aged people",36
NA,will receive the pension without first de-,36
NA,"claring themselves paupers, and without",36
NA,the having their poverty probed by govern-,36
NA,That is the .brand,36
NA,is which the boasted system now in,36
NA,operation puts on aged people of slender,36
NA,"means or of no means. Instead of that,",36
NA,provision is to be made on a' sound basis,36
NA,this for a payment which will be made with-,36
NA,out a means test. Despite these great,36
NA,"benefits, which will extend to",36
NA,"2,000,000 persons, and,",36
NA,"including children, to over one-half",36
NA,"of the population, we are told by",36
NA,"g honorable members opposite, and even",36
NA,by some honorable members on the minis-,36
NA,"side, that this is a poor little bill.",36
NA,The measure is to be very closely fol-,36
NA,lowed by a great extension of these,36
NA,"The Government has, in specific",36
NA,"terms, committed itself to the introduc-",36
NA,"tion of another measure, at an early date,",36
NA,certainly within the life of the present,36
NA,Parliament- I shall be disappointed if,36
NA,not within a year-whic h will greatly,36
NA,widen the range of benefits. The further,36
NA,instalment will cover all self-employed,37
NA,"persons of slender means. I n addition,",37
NA,all children of both the cumpulsorily and,37
NA,voluntarily insured persons will receive,37
NA,medical benefits. There is nothing,37
NA,vague about the second instalment,37
NA,of the scheme. The Government,37
NA,"brings i t in, or falls. I",37
NA,"that by no means by way of intimidation,",37
NA,"but, as the Government has made its",37
NA,"promise, I believe that it will fulfil",37
NA,Judging by the wild and reckless attack,37
NA,"made upon the bill, honorable members",37
NA,"opposite are very unwilling to hear that,",37
NA,"at an early date, this measure will be-",37
NA,come a much greater one. I commend,37
NA,"the Government for its action, and I",37
NA,particularly congratulate the Treasurer,37
NA,( Mr Casey) upon the enormous amount,37
NA,of sincere work done by him in connexion,37
NA,with the preparation and introduction of,37
NA,the biU -i n whatever calling or place they find,37
NA,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,37
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,A s I,37
NA,"was saying, I congratulate",37
NA,Treasurer upon his fine achieve-,37
NA,ment in the preparation and pre- made.,37
NA,sentation of this great measure. The,37
NA,quality most called for in public men in,37
NA,"this country to-day is courage, and there",37
NA,is great courage behind this bill. As a,37
NA,private member I should like also to asso-,37
NA,ciate myself with those who have,37
NA,expressed their deep' thanks to the able,37
NA,"and distinguished British public servant,",37
NA,"Sir Walter Kinnear, who has contributed",37
NA,so much talent and experience i n its,37
NA,"paration. Further, I pay tribute to the",37
NA,lionorable member for Parramatta ( Sir,37
NA,Frederick Stewart). He should be a very,37
NA,"happy man to-day, because I believe that,",37
NA,"had it not been for his very strong,",37
NA,".sympathetic and sustained endeavour, this",37
NA,"bill, although belated as it is, might not",37
NA,even have been before this House by this,37
NA,time.,37
NA,"Whilst, as I have already said, I take",37
NA,rliis as an instalment and rejoice that it,37
NA,is to be followed immediately by another,37
NA,"great instalment, I still look upon it as",37
NA,the greatest measure of social progress,37
NA,that has yet been before this Parliament.,37
NA,"I do not intend, therefore, to indulge",37
NA,"in criticism of it, particularly criticism",37
NA,of a close or hostile kind. Its shortcom-,37
NA,"ings are obvious, and its omissions inevit-",37
NA,able. Yet as it stands it is a great,37
NA,measure involving a great work and en-,37
NA,"tailing great expense, and I am well con-",37
NA,say tent with it-a s a beginning. I regard,37
NA,it as a commitment upon all parties in,37
NA,this House. I believe it will certainly,37
NA,it. be followed stage by stage in the near,37
NA,"future by supplementary measures, until",37
NA,"national insurance, in a comprehensive",37
NA,"way, is complete. That is why I rejoice",37
NA,in this measure and why I am satisfied,37
NA,with i t at the moment. I t is a commend-,37
NA,able venture requiring the rarest of all,37
NA,qualities-courage-an d it will lead on,37
NA,"until by a very early date, the Australian",37
NA,man and woman on the lower incomes-,37
NA,"that is, the great majority of our people",37
NA,"themselves, will be able to stand up and",37
NA,say that thes' are reasonably secure,37
NA,against adversity. That is the great,37
NA,"the objective of national insurance, and I",37
NA,rejoice that this grand beginning has been,37
NA,I intend to touch upon only three im-,37
NA,"portant phases of this subject: First, the",37
NA,position of women under the bill;,37
NA,"secondly, the friendly societies; and",37
NA,"thirdly, the position of the medical pro-",37
NA,"fession. At first glance, I was concerned",37
NA,as to the position of women under this,37
NA,measure. I t seemed to me that there was,37
NA,"inequality in that respect, but the more",37
NA,pre- I have studied it and have heard the,37
NA,"Treasurer speaking on it, the more I am",37
NA,convinced that this is an acceptable and,37
NA,fair bill to the women of Australia. I t,37
NA,is already generous to them. I believe,37
NA,that the men under this insurance scheme,37
NA,will be contributing in a substantial,37
NA,degree to the benefits inadequately paid,37
NA,for by the women who will be affected by,37
NA,the measure. I f one can associate,37
NA,"chivalry with material things, it would",37
NA,be very simple for us in this House to,37
NA,make the benefits of the women equal,37
NA,right through with those of the men; but,37
NA,it is very easy to be generous with other,37
NA,people's money. We have gone a very,37
NA,proper and very generous distance in that,38
NA,direction. I am aware that the restrain-,38
NA,ing influences with the Treasurer in,38
NA,"respect of inany features of the bill, are",38
NA,capacity to pay and practicability; but,38
NA,"I should like to see all parties, i f not now,",38
NA,"at least in the near future, bend their",38
NA,endeavours to bring about the payment,38
NA,"of £1 to insured women at the age of 60,",38
NA,and dispense with the means test in respect,38
NA,of the last os. I utterly dislike the means,38
NA,test with respect to the old-age pension.,38
NA,It is a very strong detriment to thrift.,38
NA,"As we all know, it leads to a measure",38
NA,of positive dishonesty and influences quite,38
NA,"a number of people to dissipate, or get",38
NA,"rid of, a sufficient amount of money, pos-",38
NA,session of which would be a hindrance to,38
NA,their receipt of the old-age pension.,38
NA,Although I admit that they can insure on,38
NA,"a voluntary basis to obtain that 5s., and",38
NA,"thus preclude a means test, I hope that,",38
NA,"irrespective of party, we shall all aim",38
NA,"eventually at giving the full £1, without",38
NA,"a means test, to the insured women of",38
NA,Australia upon reaching the age of 60.,38
NA,I am very jealous of the position of,38
NA,our great friendly societies in Australia.,38
NA,To me they represent one of the best,38
NA,assets of this young nation. Upon the,38
NA,number and strength of its organized,38
NA,-earnest men and women depends the,38
NA,"-security, to a large degree, of a young",38
NA,-country like ours. Through them we,38
NA,"are protected from trouble, whether",38
NA,i t be economic or other trouble,38
NA,"from within, or danger from without.",38
NA,Among the organized bodies of this,38
NA,-country I place the friendly societies very,38
NA,highly. They exercise a groat moral,38
NA,influence. They take within their ranks,38
NA,large numbers of our youth at an age,38
NA,when youth is most susceptible to undesir-,38
NA,"able influences, and one who has attended",38
NA,meetings of friendly societies cannot fail,38
NA,"to be impressed by their earnestness, dis-",38
NA,cipline and general influence for good,38
NA,"-over their young members. I should, I",38
NA,"think, be almost completely hostile to a",38
NA,form of national insurance which clearly,38
NA,"was prejudicial to friendly societies, or",38
NA,which even did not give a very generous,38
NA,opportunity to such societies to expand.,38
NA,It had been my intention-an d I do not,38
NA,withdraw that intention at this stage-,38
NA,"to move in committee, not to give to",38
NA,friendly societies exclusively the right to,38
NA,form approved societies under the,38
NA,"measure, but to narrow down the ap-",38
NA,"proved societies to the friendly societies,",38
NA,"trade unions, and employers benefit",38
NA,1,38
NA,funds which already exist or may come,38
NA,into being later on. I t was my intention,38
NA,to move for the exclusion of life insur-,38
NA,ance societies in this respect. I do not,38
NA,see what claim life insurance societies,38
NA,have to participate in this measure. The,38
NA,friendly societies have established a very,38
NA,great record; they have been the pioneers,38
NA,in this field. There has been a disposition,38
NA,on tlie part of some members of the Go-,38
NA,vernment rather to underestimate what,38
NA,"the friendly societies have done, pointing",38
NA,out that to-day they have only some,38
NA,"400,000 insurable members, whereas this",38
NA,"bill aims to insure 1,S50,000 persons. On",38
NA,"second thought, however, those honorable",38
NA,gentlemen must agree that the insurance,38
NA,"of 400,000 Australians with benefits ex-",38
NA,"tended to something like 1,000,000 souls",38
NA,"by friendly societies to-day, is a very",38
NA,notable achievement indeed. I t shows,38
NA,that those societies are completely capable,38
NA,of doing this work on a very much,38
NA,larger scale than that on which they are,38
NA,engaged at present. I t may be that they,38
NA,are not of equal efficiency in all of the,38
NA,"States, but I know that in Victoria they",38
NA,operate under very strict governmental,38
NA,"supervision, and have done their work",38
NA,there remarkably well. I do not know,38
NA,of any serious grievance having arisen,38
NA,at any time in respect of the administra-,38
NA,tion of their funds or their activities,38
NA,"generally. I still believe, therefore, that,",38
NA,the administration of this great national,38
NA,insurance scheme might safely have been,38
NA,"entrusted to them. The Government,",38
NA,"however, has decided to allow life insur-",38
NA,ance companies to come in as approved,38
NA,societies. I have no doubt that they will,38
NA,"be highly efficient, but I ask the Govern-",38
NA,ment-an d I shall use a harsh word,38
NA,-strictl y to police the life insurance,38
NA,societies with respect to canvassing.,38
NA,"It, would be improper for me to make any",38
NA,reference in detail to the evidence that,38
NA,has been given before the Royal Com-,38
NA,mission on Industrial Assurance now sit-,38
NA,"ting in Melbourne, but the great wealth",38
NA,of evidence given before the commission,38
NA,on the quality of the canvassing engaged,38
NA,in by many of the insurance companies,38
NA,goes to show that the Commonwealth Go-,39
NA,"vernment, under this scheme, must- I",39
NA,am glad to have the assurance of the,39
NA,Treasurer that i t will-devis e machinery,39
NA,with heavy penalties against the abuse of,39
NA,tbe right of canvassing.,39
NA,"The Goverument has, as all the House",39
NA,"knows, since this measure has been pro-",39
NA,"duced, clearly indicated its intention to",39
NA,make an early expansion of national,39
NA,insurance. Part of the expansion is to,39
NA,"bring under insurance, by the payment of",39
NA,"a bounty, the dependants-th e wives and",39
NA,children-o f insured men or insured mar-,39
NA,ried women. The work is to be done,39
NA,under a voluntary scheme which is- I,39
NA,hope tbe Treasurer will correct me i f I,39
NA,am in error-t o be worked by the existing,39
NA,organizations which engage in work of,39
NA,that kind.,39
Mr CASEY ,Th e honorable member is,39
NA,not in error.,39
Sir HENRY GULLETT , I am glad,39
NA,to have that assurance. I t means,39
NA,a widespread field of insured depend-,39
NA,ants which will be subsidized by,39
NA,the Commonwealth and entrusted to,39
NA,"the friendly societies, trades unions,",39
NA,and employers' benefit societies in,39
NA,existence at the present time. The new-,39
NA,work must mean greatly added strength,39
NA,"to the friendly societies, and added oppor-",39
NA,"tunity in every direction. I t does, to me,",39
NA,iake out the sting or the hardship of the,39
NA,competition of life insurance societies,39
NA,against friendly societies and the trades,39
NA,unions in respect of insured employees.,39
NA,"Therefore, I do not, at this stage,",39
NA,"express my intention, as I had",39
NA,"intended to express it, to move an amend-",39
NA,ment in committee to exclude life insur-,39
NA,ance societies.,39
NA,I come now to the position of the,39
NA,"medical practitioners. At the outset, I",39
NA,"wish to say that I , in common with, I",39
NA,"daresay, a great many other honorable",39
NA,"members of this House, have not words",39
NA,to express my direct and indirect indebted-,39
NA,ness to members of the medical profession,39
NA,in Australia. I should be the last to,39
NA,associate myself in any way with a,39
NA,measure which threatened to under-,39
NA,remuneratc the members of the medical,39
NA,profession. We are not here to sweat,39
NA,the doctors of this country. We are here,39
NA,to come to a fair arrangement with the,39
NA,"medical profession. But, we are here",39
NA,also as trustees-trustee s in a very special,39
NA,sense. The Government will not be the,39
NA,main contributor of the money that will,39
NA,be paid to the doctors. The main con-,39
NA,"tributors, as measured by their capacity",39
NA,"to pay, are to be the workers of Australia.",39
NA,"Therefore, we should be false in our",39
NA,position as trustees for both the em-,39
NA,"ployees' money in a special sense, and",39
NA,"the employers' money, if we allowed our-",39
NA,selves to be influenced into the payment,39
NA,"of a rate beyond a fair rate, to the doctors",39
NA,of Australia. I am all for a fair rate.,39
NA,"I think, however, that inasmuch as the",39
NA,medical profession was apparently work-,39
NA,ing along with satisfaction to itself under,39
NA,"the rates paid by the friendly societies,",39
NA,those friendly society rates should be taken,39
NA,as the fair basis upon which to estimate,39
NA,the rates to be paid under this bill. I,39
NA,am not competent to express any opinion,39
NA,as to what is a fair rate. I wish merely,39
NA,to read passages from the editorial of,39
NA,"the current month's Medical, Journal",39
NA,"of Australia, which i3 the official",39
NA,mouthpiece of the Australian branch,39
NA,"of the British Medical Association,",39
NA,upon this subject. This journal,39
NA,"is published in Sydney, in New",39
NA,"South Wales, the seat of the present dis-",39
NA,"satisfaction, if not revolt, against l i s . a",39
NA,"head for medical services, agreed upon",39
NA,recently by the executive of the British,39
NA,Medical Association and the Common-,39
NA,wealth Government. This executive was,39
NA,"elected in a very representative way, on a",39
NA,completely democratic basis. Members,39
NA,of the profession in the States elect State,39
NA,"councils, which in turn elect the federal",39
NA,"council, which then chooses the executive",39
NA,-tha t executive which conferred with the,39
NA,Commonwealth Treasurer to decide upon,39
NA,the proper remuneration of doctors under,39
NA,this scheme. There is no doubt as to the,39
NA,representative nature of this executive.,39
NA,"I t is no hole and corner thing, but is",39
NA,representative of the doctors themselves,39
NA,wherever they are found.,39
Mr BEASLEY ,Th e honorable gentle-,39
NA,man is not putting up a fair case.,39
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,Th e honor-,39
NA,able gentleman has not even let me come,39
NA,to the point. I am surprised to find the,39
NA,honorable member for West Sydney tak-,39
NA,ing up any attitude but one of the deepest,40
NA,concern for the workers' money.,40
Mr BEASLEY ,An d proper medical,40
NA,treatment.,40
Sir HENRY GULLETT , I do not,40
NA,agree with that. I cannot con-,40
NA,"ceive of the doctors of Australia,",40
NA,as I have known them all my,40
NA,"life, giving of anything but their very",40
NA,best professional skill to the people of,40
NA,"this country, under whatever terms are",40
NA,reached between them and the Govern-,40
NA,ment. I repeat that I should like to take,40
NA,the argument of this medical journal a3,40
NA,to why the agreement was reached and,40
NA,"as to why this amount of l i s . a year, to",40
NA,"be paid for every person insured, should",40
NA,be accepted. I shall not paraphrase this,40
NA,"article; 1 shall read passages from it, and",40
NA,allow the argument of the doctors them-,40
NA,selves to appeal to the House. This,40
NA,article no doubt was inspired by members,40
NA,of that very executive wliich entered into,40
NA,"that agreement. This, is their case as",40
NA,they put it-thi s is their plea to the pro-,40
NA,fession-a s to why l i s . should be,40
NA,accepted-,40
NA,"The Government made i t quite clear that,",40
NA,in order to ensure the smooth working of the,40
NA,"scheme, i t would seek the co-operation of the",40
NA,"medical profession. Obviously, the profession",40
NA,"had to formulate its ideas and be prepared, not",40
NA,only to state the terms under wliich i t would,40
NA,"accept service, and to give substantial reasons",40
NA,"for having adopted them, but also to do its",40
NA,utmost towards the securing of an adequate,40
NA,service to the public.,40
NA,""" Adequate services to the public! "" That",40
NA,answers the honorable member for West,40
NA,Sydney ( Mr Beasley).,40
NA,Those who followed the reports of the meet-,40
NA,ings of the Federal Council of the British,40
NA,"Medical Association iu Australia, published",40
NA,"from time to time in this journal, will know",40
NA,that much time and much thought have been,40
NA,given to this subject. I t WHS for this very,40
NA,reason that the Federal Council at its last,40
NA,meeting appointed an executive committee; and,40
NA,this committee has recently been in conference,40
NA,with representatives of the Federal Govern-,40
NA,ment.,40
NA,So it is perfectly clear that this federal,40
NA,"council in the first place, elected by the",40
NA,"six State councils, which are elected by",40
NA,"every member of the profession, gave a",40
NA,great deal of time to the preparation of,40
NA,its case.,40
Mr MAHONEY ,Tha t would be the,40
NA,inner group.,40
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,I t could,40
NA,not be an inner group. I t is thoroughly,40
NA,representative. We pass on-,40
NA,The principal decisions reached at the con-,40
NA,ference had* to do with the terms of service of,40
NA,the medical profession. I t was decided: ( i ),40
NA,That the capitation fee for a general prae-,40

NA,of a confinement and treatment of an insured,40
NA,person who becomes entitled to the benefits of,40
NA,any Commonwealth or State Workers' Compen-,40
NA,"sation Aet or Seamen's Compensation Act, and",40
NA,excluding major operations and adminis-,40
NA,tration of Anaesthetics (requiring the presence,40
NA,"of another practitioner), be eleven shilling*.",40
NA,I pass over the other things decided upon,40
NA,because this is the main issue. I reiterate,40
NA,that this is the official journal of the,40
NA,doctors of Australia. The editorial,40
NA,proceeds-,40
NA,The capitation fee was determined by con-,40
NA,sideration of the remuneration at present beinj:,40
NA,paid fur contract practice in all the States of,40
NA,Australia. The average rate of payment in,40
NA,"metropolitan areas is 25s., and in country",40
NA,"areas 30s., the weighted average being 27s.",40
Mr NOCK ,Bu t that does not apply,40
NA,to the individual.,40
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,Tha t is all,40
NA,dealt with. The article goes on-,40
NA,"However, in view of the dissatisfaction",40
NA,wliich has existed in Victoria in regard to the,40
NA,"capitation rate for contract practice, i t wu«",40
NA,decided that the standard of payment for the-e,40
NA,purposes should be that existing in Xew South,40
NA,"Wales, namely, 2fls. in the metropolitan area",40
NA,and 32s. in the country-a n average of 2!K,40
NA,Each friendly society lodge member on :i,40
NA,medical practitioner's list obviously represents,40
NA,more than one person receiving attendance:,40
NA,and i t became necessary to determine tlrs,40

NA,regarding dependants are those of the Govern-,40
NA,"ment Actuary in Victoria, who states in hi*",40
NA,"valuation report of tlie friendly societies, Unit",40
NA,each lodge member (he includes unmarried,40
NA,members) represents 3.2 persons. Therefore,40

NA,gave as a capitation rate for a complete service,41
NA,(excluding treatment in respect or a confine-,41
NA,"ment and treatment of an "" injured worker""",41
NA,lodge member entitled to the benefits of the,41
NA,Workers' Compensation Act) the amount of,41
NA,12s. After the matter had been debated at,41
NA,length it was decided to exclude anaesthesia,41
NA,from the medical benefits and to make the,41
NA,capitation fee l i s .,41
NA,Here is a point to which. I particularly,41
NA,wish to direct the attention of honorable,41
NA,members-,41
NA,I t has been claimed that friendly society,41
NA,"members represent selected risks, and that",41
NA,therefore an amount should be added to the,41
NA,capitation rate. In opposition to this view,41
NA,it is pointed out that no person will be insured,41
NA,"who is not employable, and that no insured",41
NA,person will be entitled to medical benefits,41
NA,until he has been insured for three months.,41
NA,"Moreover, the average age of friendly society",41
NA,"members is 41.0 years, and it is computed that",41
NA,the average age of those who will be,41
NA,"will be 31.5 years, the latter age regarded as",41
NA,"having a sickness rate 30 per cent, less than",41
NA,the former.,41
NA,"I t is not I who am saying that, but the",41
NA,mouthpiece of the medical profession. I,41
NA,"other words, because of the ten years",41
NA,lower average age of those who w i l l come operation,41
NA,"under the national insurance scheme, this",41
NA,official journal of the British Medical if,41
NA,"Association says that 30 per cent, less",41
NA,medical attention w i ll be required by inauguration.,41
NA,them than is at present being given by,41
NA,doctors to patients i n friendly societies,41
NA,for the equivalent of l i s . per head. I,41
NA,make no comment on that. I t speaks f or,41
NA,itself.,41
Mr MAHONEY ,Tha t is the opinion,41
NA,only of an inner group of medical men.,41
Sir HENRY GULLETT , I t is a,41
NA,thoroughly representative opinion.,41
NA,article goes into the mileage question.,41
NA,"The mileage basis is worked out, as honorbody-i",41
NA,able members w i l l see i f they follow,41
NA,"argument through, on the assumption",41
NA,that the average income of a doctor is,41
NA,"£1,500 a year, that he works 48 hours a",41
NA,"week, earns 12s. 6d. an hour, and travels",41
NA,at 25 miles an hour. A t 6d. a mile profit,41
NA,on a car he w i ll earn 12s. 6d. an hour,41

Mr FORDE ,"-""Wh o is the editor of that",41
NA,journal?,41
NA,The,41
Sir HENRY GULLETT , T h i s article,41
NA,"each must be impressive to any fair-minded,",41
NA,man who reads i t .,41
NA,[Leave to continue given.],41
NA,I ask for very little further indulgence,41
NA,and forbearance. I shall now quote one,41
NA,more passage-,41
NA,The conditions of service that have been set-,41
NA,out have been accepted by the executive com-,41
NA,mittee of the federal council as reasonable in,41
NA,view of conditions of contract practice obtain-,41
NA,ing in Australia at tlie present time. Some,41
NA,practitioners may think that the terms of,41
NA,service are not what they should be; if there,41
NA,"are any such persons, they must remember",41
NA,that claims for remuneration in a matter of,41
NA,this kind must be justifiable. On available,41
NA,data it would be extremely difficult to justify,41
NA,"claims for better conditions, except perhaps",41
NA,in one or two minor points. The federal,41
NA,council has done its duty to the community,41
NA,and to the profession which it represents.,41
NA,insured I again emphasize this point-,41
NA,For yeaTs the medical profession has been,41
NA,telling governments that it has the welfare,41
NA,"of the community at heart, and that its",41
NA,objective is the provision of a proper medical,41
NA,service for the people. Thus when the Federal,41
NA,n Grovernment has brought forward its scheme,41
NA,of national insurance and asked for the co-,41
NA,"of the medical profession, co-opera-",41
NA,tion was gladly given. Whether the scheme is,41
NA,ever put into practice remains to be seen; but,41
NA,"it does come to nothing, no one will be able",41
NA,to say with truth that the medical profession,41
NA,did anything but try to assist in its-,41
Mr FORDE ,Wha t is the date of that? 1,41
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,I t was,41
NA,published in May. I t is common know-,41
NA,ledge that there has been a good deal of,41
NA,unrest in the State of New South Wales,41
NA,among a large number of practitioners,41
NA,who are against the British Medical,41
NA,The Association. There has been a lot of,41
NA,discussion on the formation of another,41
NA,"n other words, there is a threat-",41
NA,the ened breakaway movement. I do not,41
NA,"expect a breakaway, but I do suggest, in",41
NA,"view of all the talk, that there is a possi-",41
NA,bility of a section of the profession taking,41
NA,this opportunity to make war upon the,41
NA,British Medical Association. 1 earnestly,41
NA,suggest further to members of this hon-,41
NA,orable House that we cannot accept a,41
NA,ballot of medical men on this matter.,42
NA,Could there be anything more prepos-,42
NA,terous than to submit to any body of men,42
NA,the question whether for any given ser-,42
NA,vice they should accept a given sum or,42
NA,"that sum plus 20 per cent, or 25 per cent ?",42
NA,"As long as human nature is as i t is, i f",42
NA,doctors were ten times as disinterested,42
NA,as they are the great majority of them,42
NA,would inevitably vote for the higher,42
NA,amount.,42
Mr HARRISON ,Wha t about a court,42
NA,-of inquiry?,42
Sir HENRY GULLETT , I am,42
NA,-coming to that. I suggest a fair and,42
NA,prompt solution which will not hold up,42
NA,the bill. The doctors could appoint a,42
NA,"small executive committee, say of three or",42
NA,"five members, or of one person from each",42
NA,"State, and the Government could also",42
NA,have a representative. The committee,42
NA,could be presided over by a High Court,42
NA,-or a Supreme Court Judge. That little,42
NA,tribunal could consider the position as it,42
NA,"""is at present, move forward to the national",42
NA,"-scheme, and fix what should be acceptable",42
NA,as a fair rate.,42
Mr CASEY ,Tha t would be rather,42
NA,-dangerous for the doctors.,42
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,"Yes , it",42
NA,might be. The committee that has just,42
NA,.made the investigation admits that insur-,42
NA,able people under the national scheme,42
NA,"will require 30 per cent, less service than",42
NA,the patients in friendly societies. I can-,42
NA,not believe that doctors under this scheme,42
NA,will not be well served. I express that,42
NA,"view, but I do not lay it down definitely.",42
NA,T leave the question with the Government.,42
Mr COLLINS ,Ther e should be a dif-,42
NA,ferentiation between city and country,42
NA,-doctors.,42
Sir HENRY GULLETT ,Tha t could,42
NA,'be done by regulation. There is obviously,42
NA,"room for the Government and the doctors,",42
NA,"if they are working under the scheme,",42
NA,to make amendments by regulation. The,42
NA,bill is an instalment. There is promised,42
NA,immediately upon its heels a greater in-,42
NA,surance scheme. I believe it will lead to,42
NA,unemployment insurance and even to,42
NA,"general insurance, as its practicability is",42
NA,revealed and the capacity to pay is ascer-,42
NA,tained. On those grounds I congratulate,42
NA,the Treasurer and commend the bill to,42
NA,the House.,42
Mr MAKIN ,Hindmarsh) [8.43] -,42
NA,The longer this debate proceeds the more,42
NA,the House must become convinced that the,42
NA,the legislation we are considering is ill-con-,42
NA,"ceived, hopelessly inadequate, and wholly",42
NA,unsatisfactory. I would ask honorable,42
NA,"members to bring their, minds to bear on",42
NA,the number of speeches delivered in this,42
NA,House in which honorable members ha?e,42
NA,said they are very glad that other,42
NA,measures will be introduced to supple-,42
NA,ment this legislation and that this bill is,42
NA,only an instalment. We are thus given a,42
NA,"very clear indication, even from the",42
NA,mouths of those who support the Govern-,42
NA,ment and from the sponsors of the,42
NA,"bill, of its hopeless inadequacy.",42
NA,The Government would act judiciously if,42
NA,it withdrew the measure and remodelled it,42
NA,to include features which honorable mem-,42
NA,bers on both sides Qf the chamber have,42
NA,described as essential to an effective,42
NA,national insurance scheme. I t would be,42
NA,ridiculous for honorable members opposite,42
NA,to support a bill of this description,42
NA,knowing full well that it must prove,42
NA,entirely unsatisfactory to the general,42
NA,community. Our people have great,42
NA,ambitions in regard to social insurance.,42
NA,They desire not only health and medical,42
NA,"services but, most of all, some form of",42
NA,unemployment insurance. I n my opinion,42
NA,the Government has adopted quite the,42
NA,wrong procedure in dealing with this,42
NA,subject. Apparently it intends to leave,42
NA,the most pressing problem until last.,42
NA,"Although we, admittedly, have no effective",42
NA,means to cope with the disadvantages and,42
NA,"even terrors of unemployment-w e saw,",42
NA,"during the recent depression, the stark",42
NA,tragedy of unemployment-nothin g ap-,42
NA,parently is to be done to cope with the,42
NA,situation. I say emphatically that unem-,42
NA,ployment insurance is the most pressing,42
NA,need of the day. Very few honorable,42
NA,members opposite have paid attention,42
NA,to the serious and inevitable repercussions,42
NA,of this ill-conceived scheme. Reactions,42
NA,will have to be faced not only in the,42
NA,sphere of public health which the,42
NA,"Commonwealth Government administers,",42
NA,but even more seriously in those spheres,42
NA,which fall within the responsibilities,42
NA,of the State governments. I am,43
NA,particularly concerned about the pos-,43
NA,sible effects of this measure on public,43
NA,hospitals. Unquestionably if this scheme,43
NA,"becomes operative, many contributors to",43
NA,voluntary hospital and medical funds of,43
NA,one kind and another will withdraw their,43
NA,support. Although this measure does not,43
NA,"purport to provide hospital services, per-",43
NA,sons compelled to contribute to the,43
NA,national insurance fund will,43
NA,apt mistakenly to assume that they are,43
NA,also providing for any hospital services,43
NA,"that they may need. Hospital funds are,",43
NA,"as honorable members are well aware,",43
NA,largely supported by contributions from,43
NA,groups of employees. The bill seriously,43
NA,threatens the future of these valuable,43
NA,aids to our hospitals and sanatoriums-,43
NA,The individuals in these groups,43
NA,will undoubtedly consider that a pay-,43
NA,ment of 13. Gd. a week will entitle,43
NA,"them to all the health, medical and hos-",43
NA,pital services that they are likely to,43
NA,"require, and they will cease their contri-",43
NA,butions to voluntary funds. This will,43
NA,seriously affect the revenue of many hos-,43
NA,pitals which are to-day rendering an,43
NA,invaluable service to the whole,43
NA,community.,43
NA,This one consideration should be,43
NA,cient to cause the Government to either,43
NA,withdraw the bill or adjourn the,43
NA,debate on it for a month or even longer,43
NA,in order to investigate the effects,43
NA,that the scheme is likely to have on,43
NA,many institutions and other community,43
NA,"interests. Moreover, an adjourn-",43
NA,ment of the debate would enable,43
NA,rhe Government to consider carefully tbe,43
NA,"claims of people who, on the one hand,",43
NA,"seek exemption from contributions and,",43
NA,"on the other, request inclusion in the",43
NA,scheme. Obviously it is impossible,43
NA,adequately to consider these representa-,43
NA,tions while the debate on the bill is in,43
NA,progress. I fear that unless many more,43
NA,of the basic requirements of a proper,43
NA,<cheme of national insurance are pro-,43
NA,"vided in the bill, the whole scheme will",43
NA,face failure from its inception. This,43
NA,would be extremely unfortunate.,43
NA,tho circumstances in which we find,43
NA,ourselves the Government will ren-,43
NA,der a serious disservice to the com-,43
NA,"munity, and to the great principle",43
NA,Mr Makin.,43
NA,"of national insurance, if it forces the",43
NA,issue at this stage. I fear also that the,43
NA,general public will be given an entirely,43
NA,false conception of the value of this great,43
NA,social benefit.,43
NA,Insufficient attention has been devoted,43
NA,to the probable effects of this scheme,43
NA,upon the friendly societies of Australia.,43
NA,I have a very high regard for the value,43
NA,be of these organizations. They are among,43
NA,the greatest institutions of our com-,43
NA,munity life. Probably no agencies have,43
NA,done more to' contribute to the develop-,43
NA,ment of a proper sense of good citizen-,43
NA,ship than have the friendly societies.,43
NA,Not only have the lodges enabled men,43
NA,and women to meet together to deal col-,43
NA,lectively with their social needs in the,43
NA,way of medical benefits ancl sustenance,43
NA,"in time of sickness, but they have also",43
NA,rendered a. wide community service in,43
NA,equipping men and women who have not,43
NA,had great opportunities in other spheres,43
NA,to take a worthy part in local govern-,43
NA,ment activities and even in connexion,43
NA,with Parliament itself. The friendly,43
NA,societies and trades unions have been,43
NA,a splendid training ground. Con-,43
NA,sequently any legislation which is,43
NA,likely to have the effect of cutting,43
NA,suffithe membership of these organiza-,43
NA,tions in half should be subjected to the,43
NA,most careful scrutiny. An inevitable,43
NA,result of this scheme will be that young,43
NA,men ancl women who might he attracted,43
NA,into friendly societies will decide that,43
NA,membership of these bodies is now not,43
NA,"necessary. Another factor that cannot,",43
NA,be overlooked is that many persons nor,43
NA,eligible for insurance under this scheme,43
NA,will be obliged to pay at a much higher,43
NA,rate as members of friendly societies for,43
NA,the benefits to which they are now,43
NA,entitled. This must mean that many,43
NA,societies will be seriously handicapped in,43
NA,their work.,43
NA,Still another adverse effect that the,43
NA,scheme is likely to have on friendly,43
NA,societies is that it will impair the good,43
NA,work now being done among juveniles.,43
NA,Under this bill juveniles between the,43
NA,In ages of fourteen and sixteen years will,43
NA,be entitled to medical benefits only on,43
NA,ihe payment of a contribution of Sd. a,43
NA,week-4d . of which will be provided by,43
NA,the insured person and 4d. by the em-,43
NA,ployer. Do honorable members realize,44
NA,that many friendly societies are to-day,44
NA,providing this service for a fee of 3d. a,44
NA,week? Another objection I have to offer,44
NA,"in this connexion is that, although",44
NA,juveniles upon reaching the age of six-,44
NA,teen years will be required to pay the,44
NA,"full contribution of 13. 6d. a week, they",44
NA,will not be entitled to full benefits,44
NA,until they reach the age of 21 years.,44
NA,"This to my mind is totally unjust,",44
NA,"i t is astounding to find that, whilst an",44
NA,Australian youth of sixteen has contri-,44
NA,buted Is. 6d. weekly to this scheme- a,44
NA,higher rate than he should be asked to,44
NA,pay-h e will be deprived of full benefits,44
NA,"until 21 years of age, whereas it would",44
NA,be possible for a person recently resident,44
NA,in Australia and who may even be a,44
NA,foreigner to claim full benefits after 20,44
NA,weeks and a disablement pension after 104,44
NA,payments. In these circumstances it cannot,44
NA,be said that the scheme is fair and,44
NA,able. Dp to the present the relations,44
NA,between friendly societies and,44
NA,members of the British Medical Associa-,44
NA,tion have been most cordial. Although,44
NA,medical services provided to friendly,44
NA,societies have been of the highest stan-,44
NA,"dard, ancl work h,i3 been conducted under",44
NA,"most harmonious conditions, it is now",44
NA,proposed to disturb what has proved to,44
NA,he a much superior arrangement than,44
NA,that proposed by this bill. We are not,44
NA,entitled to impose a demand upon the,44
NA,medical profession which definitely lowers,44
NA,the status of their practice and then,44
NA,threaten them with what is almost,44
NA,equivalent to duress i f they do not,44
NA,comply. This measure goes much further,44
NA,"than some honorable members imagine,",44
NA,it is not merely a means of carrying,44
NA,out our ordinary health and medical,44
NA,"services, but members of the medical pro-",44
NA,fession will also be required to accept a,44
NA,responsibility which they do not now,44
NA,carry under our present pension system.,44
NA,A good deal of the medical work associated,44
NA,with pensions is done through govern-,44
NA,mental departments; but by reason of,44
NA,rhe disablement benefits now so substan-,44
NA,"tially covered by existing legislation,",44
NA,doctors will be required to undertake,44
NA,work previously undertaken by depart-,44
NA,"mental doctors, and also to receive a",44
NA,remuneration lower than they are,44
NA,receiving from friendly societies. Thoso,44
NA,affected by this legislation should not,44
NA,be in a worse position than they are,44
NA,to-day. I f the work is to be smoothly,44
NA,"and harmoniously conducted, and the",44
NA,"standard of efficiency is to be high, i t is",44
NA,our responsibility to see that con-,44
NA,"ditions likely to cause friction, concern",44
NA,or injustice are entirely eliminated.,44
NA,The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has tried,44
NA,to make us believe that no,44
NA,one has protested against this,44
NA,measure; but I have not heard of any,44
NA,section of the community which favours,44
NA,it. Those who are supposed to be bene-,44
NA,ficiaries are not at all enamoured of,44
NA,the scheme. This bill is greatly inequit-,44
NA,able to womenwho have an absolute,44
NA,right to equal status in benefits to,44
NA,men. They desire some form of,44
NA,national protection against unemploy-,44
NA,"ment, sickness ancl invalidity, and par-",44
NA,ticularly one that is universal to all,44
NA,"equitmembers of the community, but this",44
NA,scheme does not contain the features they,44
NA,the desire.,44
NA,Mr BARKIS' -The y clo not realize the,44
NA,benefits they are to receive.,44
Mr MAKIN , They are quickly,44
NA,becoming aware of the position in,44
NA,which they will be placed when,44
NA,the measure becomes law. When,44
NA,the honorable member for Bendigo,44
NA,"returns to his constituency, he will",44
NA,realize that there is intense dissatisfac-,44
NA,"tion with the scheme. I f he were candid,",44
NA,he would admit that the bulk of his,44
NA,correspondence lately has consisted,44
NA,of letters protesting against this legisla-,44
NA,"tion, and I challenge him to deny it.",44
NA,I invite him to produce one letter he has,44
NA,received expressing approval of the bill.,44
NA,I f such a letter can be produced it should,44
NA,be preserved as a unique document.,44
NA,Those who are supposed to be beneficiaries,44
NA,are dissatisfied with the bill. The friendly,44
NA,societies are apprehensive of their rights,44
NA,"and of the protection they will receive,",44
NA,and tho3c who have to provide the medical,44
NA,services are irritated and dissatisfied with,44
NA,the conditions set down for them.,44
Mr BEASLEY ,The y say that tbey will,44
NA,rot work under them.,44
Mr MAKIN,Th o members of rhe,44
NA,medical profession have made serious,44
NA,complaints concerning the remuneration,45
NA,they are to receive and that position must,45
NA,"be satisfactorily adjusted, and not dealt",45
NA,with by an arbitrary method which has,45
NA,characterized the Government's actions,45
NA,up to this stage.,45
NA,The most serious feature of this,45
NA,legislation is its humiliating nature,45
NA,particularly when studied in conto,45
NA,junction with our present invalid,45
NA,old-age pensions legislation; because,45
NA,attempt is being made to differentiate form,45
NA,between a pension as a right and what,45
NA,some regard as an act of charity. Eor many,45
NA,years we have been endeavouring to make,45
NA,the recipients of pensions understand,45
NA,the small amount that they receive is,45
NA,"theirs hy right and is not charity,",45
NA,when this scheme becomes operative those,45
NA,who apply for the invalid or old-age,45
NA,sions will be made to feel that the,45
NA,they are paupers. For two years the,45
NA,present Treasurer administered one of the,45
NA,most reactionary phases of pur invalid,45
NA,and old-age pensions legislation which,45
NA,demanded that on the death of a penfrom,45
NA,sioner the Government should be rethe,45
NA,imbursed from his estate the amount of,45
NA,"a pension paid. Moreover, some persons",45
NA,were compelled to contribute towards the,45
NA,maintenance of relatives receiving in-,45
NA,valid and old-age pensions. I n every,45
NA,sible way the Government endeavoured,45
NA,defeat the purpose of the Invalid and,45
NA,"age Pensions Aet, and thousands of perwhich",45
NA,sons surrendered their pensions rather,45
NA,than submit to humiliating inquiries.,45
NA,The Government has introduced this legisone,45
NA,lation with the idea of providing social,45
NA,"services to the people, and a means wheretion",45
NA,by the people shall pay for their own,45
NA,pensions. I t is therefore equivalent,45
NA,class tax. The Treasurer was sufficiently,45
NA,candid to say that under this bill it,45
NA,"expected .that, although the amount",45
NA,pension purposes would increase from,45
NA,"£15,000,000 to £32,000.000 in 40 years,",45
NA,but that at the end of that period,45
NA,Treasury would not be required to,45
NA,vide out of general revenue an amount,45
NA,greater than will be required next,45
NA,That really means that the amount will,45
NA,have to be made up by means of a special,45
NA,tax upon the working community.,45
Mr RANKIN ,An d upon employers,45
NA,too.,45
NA,Mr Makin.,45
Mr MAKIN ,Th e employers have to,45
NA,"provide £5,500,000 per annum at the out-",45
NA,"set, which amount will ultimately be in-",45
NA,"creased to £7,750,000 per annum; but the",45
NA,proportion which the employers contribute,45
NA,will be passed on to the community by,45
NA,higher prices thus increasing the cost ol,45
NA,living. The workers will not be allowed,45
NA,make a claim before the Arbitration,45
NA,and Court for higher wage standards,45
NA,an because of heavier costs in the,45
NA,"of contributions, but the",45
NA,employers will be able to recoup them-,45
NA,selves by passing on the cost to others.,45
NA,Those who come under this legislation,45
NA,that will not be the only ones who have to,45
NA,meet higher costs in that respect; but,45
NA,but because every member of the community,45
NA,will be faced with a higher cost of living.,45
NA,penThis will depreciate the value even of,45
NA,"existing old-age pension, because the",45
NA,pensioner must bear his share of the cost,45
NA,of the scheme in the form of higher prices,45
NA,and indirect taxation. I n every way,45
NA,possible the Government is seeking to levy,45
NA,the people who can least afford i t,45
NA,"cost of this insurance scheme, which",45
NA,should be nation-wide in its application,45
NA,as regards both benefits and costs.,45
NA,"The other night, the honorable mem-",45
NA,posber for Richmond ( Mr Anthony) said,45
NA,to that the Opposition had not put forward,45
NA,Olda detailed scheme to replace the scheme,45
NA,"they criticized. To-night, the hon-",45
NA,orable member for Henty ( Sir Henry,45
NA,"Gullett) said that, with the exception of",45
NA,"brief spell of two years, the Labour",45
NA,party had been in the shades of opposi-,45
NA,"for 22 years, and that during the",45
NA,whole of that time i t had not been respon-,45
NA,to a sible for adding a single line to the,45
NA,"statute-book. I f that be so, then the",45
NA,was party opposite must be culpable for the,45
NA,for inordinately long time taken evolving,45
NA,"the present insurance scheme, which",45
NA,is probably the most incomplete and,45
NA,the unsatisfactory expression of social,45
NA,proinsurance that it is possible to,45
NA,imagine. The Government excuses itself,45
NA,year. for the poorness of its effort by,45
NA,saying that it hopes to make improve-,45
NA,ments and additions as time goes on. I,45
NA,fear that those honorable members who,45
NA,expect the Government to honour this,45
NA,promise will receive a rude awakening.,45
NA,I have here the report of an address,45
NA,"delivered by Mr Savage, tbe Prime",46
NA,"Minister of New Zealand, regarding tbe",46
NA,social insurance scheme which is to be,46
NA,inaugurated in that country. The Labour,46
NA,Government has been in power in that,46
NA,"dominion for less than three years, but it",46
NA,has done more in that time to promote,46
NA,the social welfare of the people than did,46
NA,all the governments that preceded it. The,46
NA,report is as follows:-,46
NA,SOCIAL INSURANCE EST NEW ZEALAND.,46
NA,"Dealing with the health scheme, Mr Savage",46
NA,said that tlie Government proposed a universal,46
NA,general practitioner service free to all mem-,46
NA,bers of tlie community requiring medical,46
NA,attention. I t also proposed free hospital or,46
NA,"sanatorium treatment for all, free mental",46
NA,hospital care and treatment for the mentally,46
NA,"afflicted, free medicines, and free maternity",46
NA,"treatment, including the cost of maintenance",46
NA,"in a maternity home, and, in addition, a grant",46
NA,would be made through some suitable agency,46
NA,to assist mothers in special circumstances to,46
NA,provide an outfit for the baby.,46
NA,""" These are the proposals which we think",46
NA,"can be established at the outset,"" said Mr.",46
NA,"Savage, "" but, i n addition to these, we will",46
NA,establish when practicable the following,46
NA,services:-(1 ) Anaesthetic; (2) laboratory,46
NA,and radiology; (3) specialist and consultant;,46
NA,(4) massage; (5) transport service to and,46
NA,from hospital; (0) dental benefit; (7) optical,46
NA,"benefit.""",46
NA,"In addition to these benefits, i t is proposed",46
NA,to provide home nursing and domestic help,46
NA,when the necessary staff has been trained to,46
NA,make such a proposal practical. The Labour,46
NA,Government will also provide for an extended,46
NA,"health education, this being a continuation of",46
NA,measures to educate the public in the pro-,46
NA,motion of health and the prevention of,46
NA,disease.,46
NA,Other benefits by way of increased pensions,46
NA,wore announced as follows:-,46
NA,Invalidity Pension -Pensio n,46
NA,"1030, £1 per week.",46
NA,Proposed New Pension - £1 10s. per week.,46
NA,"* Plus 10s. a week for the wife, plus 10s. a",46
NA,week for each child under sixteen years of,46
NA,age. Maximum pension £4 per week.,46
NA,Sustenance Benefits -Presen t rates to con-,46
NA,tinue except that the children's allowance is,46
NA,to be increased from 4s. per child to 5s.,46
NA,Widows' Pensions -Thi s pension that has,46
NA,already been increased by 10s. a week is to,46
NA,be further increased to £1 5s. a week. A t the,46
NA,"present time, the pension is payable for",46
NA,children until they reach fifteen years of age.,46
NA,I t is now proposed to increase this age to,46
NA,sixteen years and the pension may be con-,46
NA,tinued in special cases to eighteen years while,46
NA,the children remain at school. The allowable,46
NA,income in addition to the pension will be,46
NA,"£1 10s. Furthermore, an anomaly in the exist-",46
NA,"ing law is io be removed, permitting the pay-",46
NA,ment of a pension of £1 with an allowable,46
NA,income above the pension of £1 whatever her,46
NA,age might be when the youngest child attains,46
NA,the age of sixteen years. Every widow who,46
NA,is otherwise eligible and who did once receive,46
NA,the pension which was discontinued because,46
NA,her children reached the age of fifteen years,46
NA,will be eligible to receive this pension. The,46
NA,position of the childless widow will be met by,46
NA,"the institution of a pension of £1 a week,",46
NA,"with £1 allowable income; in addition, from",46
NA,the age of 50 years or whatever age they were,46
NA,widowed after they reach the age of 50 years,46
NA,they will receive the pension provided that,46
NA,the marriage had lasted for not less than five,46
NA,years.,46
NA,Deserted Wives --Thei r pensions will,46
NA,increase in conformity with the widow's pen-,46
NA,sion basis.,46
NA,Mental Cases -Wome n whose husbands are,46
NA,patients in mental hospitals w i l l also receive,46
NA,a pension on the widow's pension basis.,46
NA,Pensions for Orphans -Childre n who are,46
NA,orphaned will receive 15s. a week if under the,46
NA,age of sixteen years.,46
NA,Family Allowances -Th e present allowance,46
NA,is 2s. for each child from the third onward,46
NA,with a maximum income of £4 plus the allow-,46
NA,ance. The Labour Government proposes to,46
NA,increase the amount for the third and subse-,46
NA,quent child to 4s. per week; to continue i t,46
NA,"until the child reaches sixteen years, and to",46
NA,"pay in cases where the family income, not",46
NA,"including allowance, does not exceed £5 per",46
NA,week.,46
NA,Miners' Pension -Sufferer s from miner's,46
NA,phthisis will receive an increased pension of,46
NA,"£1 10s. Furthermore, an anomaly i n the exist-",46
NA,War Veterans -I t is proposed to increase,46
NA,the war veteran's pension to the following,46
NA,"scale, namely, £1 5s. for the veteran, plus 15s.",46
NA,"for the wife, plus 5s. for each child', with n",46
NA,maximum of £3 10s. and an allowance income,46
NA,in addition to tlie pension of £ 1 .,46
NA,""" Perhaps the class in the community who",46
NA,have looked forward with the keenest anticipa-,46
NA,tion to the Labour Government's action iu,46
NA,granted in establishing greater social security are the,46
NA,group who are approaching the age at wliich,46
NA,they are no longer able to earn a full liveli-,46
NA,"hood,"" said the Prime Minister of New",46
NA,"Zealand. "" The Labour Government's pro-",46
NA,posal is to go far beyond what was originally,46
NA,contemplated by those who instituted this,46
NA,pioneer movement and well beyond what we,46
NA,"have attained to-day.""",46
NA,"The Labour Government proposes, in the",46
NA,"meantime, that, at the age of GO. men and",46
NA,women w i l l receive £1 10s. per week each for,46
NA,"the remainder of their days and, in addition",46
NA,"to this State superannuation, there will be",46
NA,"allowed aii income of £1 from other sources,",46
NA,either in the case of an individual or n,46
NA,"married couple. Thus, a single man will be",46
NA,"able to receive up to £2 10s., including his",46

NA,How SCHEME IS TO HE FINANCED.,47
NA,"The Prime Minister of Xew Zealand, Mr.",47
NA,"Savage, said: "" I notice that some critics",47
NA,anticipate a very heavy increase in direct,47
NA,taxation to finance the Government's pro,47
NA,"pnsnls, and, possibly, many will imagine thai",47
NA,these substantial increases in social progress,47
NA,arc going to cost an enormous amount. So,47
NA,"they will, but perhaps I ought to remind you",47
NA,"that a few years ago we were paying, under a",47
NA,"Tory government, Is. in the £1 on wages and",47
NA,"incomes, greatly below present standard rates",47
NA,"and although the tax was high, the benefits",47
NA,were appallingly inadequate.,47

NA,Increase in the rate of old-age pensions.,47
NA,The institution of a universal health,47
NA,service for all classes of the community.,47
NA,"As a crown to these achievements, there will",47
NA,be the institution of a State superannuation,47
NA,service that will remove once arid for all the,47
NA,"fear of want in the eventide of life.""",47
NA,[Leave to continue given.],47
NA,That programme is in marked contrast,47
NA,to the scheme which we have now before,47
NA,us.,47
Mr THOMPSON ,"""Woul d the Labour",47
NA,"party, if in power, put into operation in",47
NA,Australia a scheme similar to that which,47
NA,the honorable member has been outlining?,47
Mr MAKIN ,Th e Labour party contained,47
NA,would put forward proposals that would,47
NA,be substantially in agreement with the,47
NA,New Zealand scheme. We believe that,47
NA,any scheme of social insurance should,47
NA,"absolutely equitable to both sexes, ancl",47
NA,"universal in its application, and should",47
NA,"provide safeguards, not only against",47
NA,"sickness, but also unemployment and other",47
NA,"forms of adversity, and that this should",47
NA,not be done at the expense of one section,47
NA,"of the community only, as this Govern-",47
NA,"ment is proposing, and that the poorest",47
NA,section. We believe in a fair apportion-,47
NA,ment of the costs of this social dividend,47
NA,to the nation by providing a portion,47
NA,"from the public revenues, and thus those",47
NA,in the more fortunate positions in,47
NA,life would also make their just contri-,47
NA,bution towards the financing of any,47
NA,"scheme of social insurance. To-day, in",47
NA,"many of the States, special taxation is",47
NA,already levied in order to clo much that,47
NA,is proposed under this bill; this should,47
NA,be used to finance a comprehensive scheme,47
NA,of national insurance. There has been,47
NA,method in the framing of this legis-,47
NA,lation. I t has been so drafted as to,47
NA,remove the cost of social services from the,47
NA,well-to-do section of the people and place,47
NA,"it on the shoulders of the working classes,",47
NA,many of whom have to subsist upon the,47
NA,"equivalent of the basic wage, without hav-",47
NA,ing the right to participate in the benefits,47
NA,of the scheme. I n order that honorable,47
NA,members may have a true appreciation of,47
NA,the relative merits of the scheme pro-,47
NA,posed by this Government and the one,47
NA,sponsored by the Labour Government of,47
NA,New Zealand,47
Mr THOMPSON ,Woul d a Cominon-,47
NA,.wealth Labour government endorse the,47
NA,New Zealand scheme?,47
Mr MAKIN , I have already answered,47
NA,the question. The Assistant Minister,47
NA,is not always ready to give information,47
NA,to honorable members about matters in,47
NA,"which he is interested, but I assure the",47
NA,House tbat i f national insurance legisla-,47
NA,tion produced by a Commonwealth Labour,47
NA,government did not confer upon the people,47
NA,of this country greater benefits than are,47
NA,in the scheme now before the,47
NA,"House, we would indeed be ashamed of",47
NA,the attempt. I f this proposed scheme is,47
NA,a sample of the collective wisdom of min-,47
NA,be isters it is nothing to be proud of. The,47
NA,more that is known of it the greater will,47
NA,be the condemnation of it by the people,47
NA,because of its inadequate and unsatisfac-,47
NA,tory service. I submit for the informa-,47

Mr HOLT ,"Eawkner) [ 9.41 ""| -I t is",49
NA,not my intention to speak at length upon,49
NA,the amendment moved by the Leader of,49
NA,"ihe Opposition ( Mr Curtin), because the",49
NA,different points which he raised have,49
NA,been answered effectively by members on,49
NA,"this side of the House. But, perhaps, I",49
NA,may be permitted to deal with the situa-,49
NA,tion which is alleged by the honorable,49
NA,member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) to,49
NA,exist in New Zealand. May I ask the,49
NA,honorable gentleman i f he would be pre-,49
NA,pared to accept the New Zealand scheme,49
NA,"as adequate for Australia, and would it",49
NA,lie supported by the Labour party of the,49
NA,Commonwealth?,49
Mr MAKIN , I said that the Labour,49
NA,"movement of this country.would ""certainly",49
NA,sponsor a scheme equally as satisfactory,49
NA,and beneficial to the people as is the,49
NA,proposal made by the New Zealand,49
NA,Government.,49
Mr HOLT,W e may take it then,49
NA,that a scheme on the lines of the New,49
NA,Zealand proposal would be introduced by,49
NA,a Labour government i f it decided to in-,49
NA,troduce a national insurance bill. Per-,49
NA,haps I should not go so far as that. Per-,49
NA,haps I should state the position more,49
NA,accurately i f I said that in listening to,49
NA,"the honorable member for Hindmarsh,",49
NA,one could almost be persuaded that one,49
NA,heard the sonorous phrases of Mr Lang-,49
NA,delivering one of his policy speeches to,49
NA,"New South Wales electors, and making",49
NA,"specious promises, most of which he never",49
NA,had the good fortune or the ability to,49
NA,have incorporated in the statute law of,49
NA,that State. I suggest that the nearest,49
NA,"wliich the New Zealand scheme, in its",49
NA,"present form, will get to adoption in this",49
NA,Parliament will be the incorporation of,49
NA,an outline of it by the honorable mem-,49
NA,ber for Hindmarsh in Hansard. The,49
NA,New Zealand proposals have been mooted,49
NA,"for the last two years, but have not",49
NA,yet taken tangible shape in the form of a,49
NA,bill presented to the dominion parlia-,49
NA,ment. When the honorable member for,49
NA,"Hindmarsh, or any other member of",49
NA,"the Opposition, can show that there",49
NA,has been placed on the statute-,49
NA,book of New Zealand a measure,49
NA,which is more generous and more,49
NA,comprehensive than the scheme before,49
NA,"the House, he may have some cause to pat",49
NA,himself and his colleagues on tho back.,49
NA,The important distinction between the,49
NA,New Zealand Government's proposal and,49
NA,the scheme now before this House is,49
NA,that this Government has redeemed,49
NA,its promise. This national insurance bill,49
NA,represents tho greatest achievement in,49
NA,social legislation in the history of the,49
NA,Commonwealth. Parliament. When we,49
NA,claim that it is merely a first instalment,49
NA,we are ridiculed and told that we should,49
NA,be prepared to accept proposals to make,49
NA,it a complete bill. As evidence of the,49
NA,sincerity of our claim J refer honorable,49
NA,members to our past record. I t has been,49
NA,"stated, and apparently accepted, that for",49
NA,20 years out of the last 22 years members,49
NA,of the same political colour as that of,49
NA,the present Ministerial parties have had,49
NA,the responsibility of government in the,49
NA,Commonwealth sphere. I remind the,49
NA,House that it was a Liberal government,49
NA,which introduced the first old-age pen-,49
NA,"sions legislation. Of that legislation, as",49
NA,"it is claimed of this bill, it was to be",49
NA,regarded as an instalment. That scheme,49
NA,"was introduced in 190S, and in 1909-10",49
NA,"there were 65,492 pensioners who were",49
NA,"paid 10s. a week, the total cost being",49
NA,"£1,433,588. The second instalment came",49
NA,"in the following year, when the act made",49
NA,provision for invalid pensioners who also,49
NA,received pensions of 10s. a week. So,49
NA,the pensions system has gradually grown,49
NA,until for the current year the total num-,49
NA,"ber of pensioners is estimated at 311,000,",49
NA,"who will receive £1 a week, and the total",49
NA,"pensions bill will amount to £15,850,000.",49
NA,This record of fulfilment justifies the,50
NA,people in accepting the Government's,50
NA,assurance that this bill is a first instal-,50
NA,"ment of reform, to be supplemented later.",50
NA,Whilst not accepting the proposal,50
NA,bt-fore the House as anything in,50
NA,i lie nature of a comprehensive scheme,50
NA,"uf social insurance, I welcome it",50
NA,"as a first instalment, and as one",50
NA,which will add materially to the,50
NA,well-being of the people. I t was,50
NA,suggested by honorable members opposite,50
NA,"to-day, and in particular by the honor-",50
NA,"able member for Batman ( Mr Brennan),",50
NA,that under this scheme the Government,50
NA,"will ""extort"" Is. 6d. a week from the",50
NA,workers without consulting them. Let us,50
NA,examine that statement. For every Is. 6d.,50
NA,"a week which will be "" extorted "" from",50
NA,"them, the workers will receive, by way",50
NA,"of benefits, 6s. 6d. a week.",50
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Wher e is that pro-,50
NA,vided in the bill?,50
Mr HOLT ,Th e announcement was,50
NA,made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Lyons),50
NA,in his speech to the House earlier in the,50
NA,debate. I have not yet heard any honor-,50
NA,able member opposite challenge the,50
NA,accuracy of that statement.,50
Mr ROSEVEAR ,Ho w does it work out?,50
Mr HOLT ,Th e worker will pay,50
NA,Is. 6d. a week and the employer Is 6d. a,50
NA,"week, so the worker is to get the benefit",50
NA,"of a total contribution of 3s., although",50
NA,be will pay only one-half of it. That is,50
NA,elementary reasoning; i f the honorable,50
NA,"member cannot see that, I am merely",50
NA,wasting my time in endeavouring to ex-,50
NA,"plain it. In addition, we find that the",50
NA,average age of those coming into the,50
NA,scheme is 32 years. The Government has,50
NA,stated that so far as its contribution is,50
NA,"concerned, it will treat every person com-",50
NA,ing into the scheme as though he were,50
NA,"aged sixteen; consequently, in respect of",50
NA,"those over that age, it will have to pay",50
NA,additional premium which would be,50
NA,necessary if the scheme were calculated on,50
NA,an actuarial basis as is done in connexion,50
NA,with private insurance schemes. I n other,50
NA,"words, the Government will have to pay",50
NA,ihe difference between the premium re-,50
NA,"quired of a man aged 32, and that re-",50
NA,quired of a youth aged sixteen. Adopt-,50
NA,ing the statement of the Prime Minister,50
NA,"in his speech on this bill, I suggest to",50
NA,"the honorable member that, on the",50
NA,"average, the return to contributors will",50
NA,be 6s. 6d. for every Is. 6d. paid in by,50
NA,"them. I f that is extortion, I think it",50
NA,"would be found that very many persons""",50
NA,"in the community, other than workers,",50
NA,"who will be making contributions,",50
NA,would welcome its application to,50
NA,them. I t is said that we have,50
NA,not consulted the workers in regard,50
NA,to this proposal. My reply to that is,50
NA,that at the last election the two major,50
NA,items of policy put forward by,50
NA,"the Government were, first, the defence",50
NA,"programme, and secondly, national insur-",50
NA,ance. I t cannot be claimed now that,50
NA,anybody who studied the matter at all,50
NA,could have been under any misconception,50
NA,as to whether the scheme was to be con-,50
NA,tributory or not. The Government,50
NA,"stated during the election campaign, that",50
NA,its national insurance scheme would be on,50
NA,a contributory basis. Sir Walter Kin-,50
NA,"near, on whose report this scheme is",50
NA,"based, was known to members of the Op-",50
NA,position and to the public generally,50
NA,to have advocated a contributory,50
NA,system. The International Labour,50
NA,"Office, which has always attempted",50
NA,to deal fairly with the industrial,50
NA,"workers of the world, said that the",50
NA,only satisfactory basis of an insurance,50
NA,scheme of this character was a contri-,50
NA,butory one. How can it be claimed that,50
NA,the workers of this country knew nothing,50
NA,whatever about the sort of scheme which,50
NA,"would be proposed, when thoy themselves",50
NA,endorsed so wholeheartedly the Govern-,50
NA,ment'-; programme at the last general,50
NA,elections? Let us consider for a moment,50
NA,how the pensions aspect of this measure,50
NA,will apply to tho community generally.,50
NA,I f we examine the statistics on this ques-,50
NA,"tion, wc find that at present only 35 per",50
NA,"cent, of people of pensionable age are in",50
NA,"receipt of pensions; consequently, with",50
NA,the extension of the pensions system pro-,50
NA,"the posed by this bill, the overwhelming",50
NA,majority of the people of pensionable age,50
NA,throughout the Commonwealth will be,50
NA,able to share in the pension benefits which,50
NA,it provides.,50
NA,I wish now to say something about,50
NA,the health insurance proposals. I f there,50
NA,is one tragedy associated with the Con-,50
NA,"stitution of the Commonwealth, it is the",50
NA,unsatisfactory position in relation to,50
NA,"health, To use a hackneyed phrase,",50
NA,health may be fairly described as the,51
NA,Cinderella of the social services. The,51
NA,Commonwealth has not complete power,51
NA,over health. Though the States have the,51
NA,"major portion of that power, I suggest",51
NA,they have not accepted their full respon-,51
NA,"sibilities in relation to it. Consequently,",51
NA,we have had far too small a proportion,51
NA,of Government time and money expended,51
NA,in health measures throughout the Com-,51
NA,monwealth. Under this bill medical and,51
NA,sickness benefits are to be provided; but,51
NA,while one welcomes that addition to our,51
NA,"present social services, it is to be sincerely",51
NA,hoped that this is not to be another case,51
NA,of putting the cart before the horse.,51
NA,"Surely, Government measures along lines",51
NA,of prevention must be better than any,51
NA,palliative or compensation after sickness,51
NA,or disability has actually occurred. I,51
NA,sincerely hope that the Government will,51
NA,not simply accept this health insurance,51
NA,proposal as its only contribution to the,51
NA,advancement of optimum health stan-,51
NA,dards. It would be sterility of statesman-,51
NA,ship indeed to make provision by way of,51
NA,compensation when sickness or dis-,51
NA,"ablement actually occurs, and not to take",51
NA,"such measures as are possible, and indeed",51
NA,"necessary, to improve general health",51
NA,standards. We have had the resolutions,51
NA,"of the Nutrition Council, and the recom-",51
NA,mendations of the Council of Medical and,51
NA,"Health Research, both bodies com-",51
NA,posed of men of eminence and,51
NA,great knowledge in the,51
NA,profession. It is certainly to be,51
NA,"hoped that the Government, because it has",51
NA,"given us this measure, will not simply",51
NA,relegate to the background its respon-,51
NA,sibilities for the adoption of preventive,51
NA,"health measures. I think we may hope,",51
NA,"and with reason, that if this scheme is the",51
NA,"success which we, on this side of the",51
NA,"House, confidently expect, there will",51
NA,not be the same reluctance in the,51
NA,"future, as there is to-day, to hand over",51
NA,to the Commonwealth sovereign powers,51
NA,over health. Our activities in that regard,51
NA,should not be concerned merely with the,51
NA,provision of medical benefits;,51
NA,is our responsibility to improve,51
NA,health standards by attention,51
NA,"nutrition, and by seeing that our people",51
NA,"are not only adequately fed, but are",51
NA,"also properly housed and clothed,",51
NA,and have congenial employment.,51
NA,Mr Bolt.,51
NA,these are factors which go to improve,51
NA,the health standards; they are also,51
NA,material factors in the financial,51
NA,success of the national health insurance,51
NA,scheme. I f the general standard of health,51
NA,"can be improved, any national insurance",51
NA,scheme based actuarially on existing,51
NA,health standards will be placed on a,51
NA,safer financial basis. Investigations in,51
NA,the United States of America have,51
NA,shown that relief workers are sick,51
NA,twice as often and for twice as long as,51
NA,workers engaged in regular employ-,51
NA,ment. This illustration suggests how,51
NA,those other factors of our social life to,51
NA,which I have referred are wrapped,51
NA,up with the general health standards,51
NA,of the community! [Quorum formed.],51
NA,One aspect of this scheme which has,51
NA,not been dealt with by any honorable,51
NA,member up to the present is that it is,51
NA,based on the assumption that the average,51
NA,age of those entering it is 32 years. Any,51
NA,contributor coming into the scheme at,51
NA,"that age, or beyond it, will receive benefits",51
NA,"out of proportion to his contributions,",51
NA,in comparison with a young man who,51
NA,"conies in at, perhaps, 1G years of age,",51
NA,or even later. I am linking up this point,51
NA,with the suggestion that quite simple,51
NA,improvements of our general health,51
NA,standards could be made. We have pro-,51
NA,"vided under the scheme that 50 per cent,",51
NA,of the accumulated surpluses of approved,51
NA,societies shall be brought into a common,51
NA,medical pool. The suggestion I make is that of,51
NA,the surplus brought into the common,51
NA,"pool 50 per cent, should be devoted to",51
NA,"preventive measures, and to the",51
NA,improvement of general health standards.,51
NA,The fund should be used to foster a,51
NA,campaign of national fitness throughout,51
NA,the Commonwealth by the provision of,51
NA,"gymnasiums, swimming pools, ard other",51
NA,forms of physical exercise which would,51
NA,"have the effect, unquestionably, of improv-",51
NA,ing general health standards. I hope,51
NA,"that, in order to recompense those young",51
NA,"people who, under the present scheme-",51
NA,will not get the same benefits in propor-,51
NA,it tion to their contributions as older con-,51
NA,"tributors, the Government will serious'y",51
NA,to consider my proposal. Distribution,51
NA,could be made in a manner which could,51
NA,not fail to benefit the community gener-,51
NA,ally by assisting in the prevention of,51
NA,"All disease, and improving the physique and",51
NA,general health of the younger members,52
NA,"of the community, and also assist the",52
NA,scheme itself by reducing the degree of,52
NA,"ill health which, but for those measures,",52
NA,would come to those people later in life.,52
NA,I have noted the suggestion of the,52
NA,Go\eminent concerning benefits to wives,52
NA,""" f insured persons. Most honorable mem-",52
NA,bers felt that the omission from the pre-,52
NA,sent scheme of provision of medical bene-,52
NA,fits for wives of insured persons was a,52
NA,serious defect. I welcome the suggestion,52
NA,which has been made for assistance to,52
NA,friendly societies which are prepared to,52
NA,^ive medical benefits to wives and,52
NA,dependants. I hope that that does not,52
NA,represent the full extent of the Govern-,52
NA,ment's programme in respect of wives.,52
NA,"There are 700,000 married men who, we",52
NA,"understand, are to come under the",52
NA,"scheme, and it is suggested that the",52
NA,estimated cost will not be in excess of,52
NA,"£175,000, assuming that 5s. is paid in",52
NA,respect of each married man. I under-,52
NA,"stand from the Treasurer, however, that",52
NA,this assistance is to be given only to,52
NA,friendly societies and to analogous bodies,52
NA,guaranteeing similar forms of benefit.,52
NA,If the Government adheres to its pro-,52
NA,"posal to permit various big business firms,",52
NA,"which have their own schemes, as well as",52
NA,"the insurance companies, to participate,",52
NA,"obviously many of those 700,000 married",52
NA,men will elect to come under the schemes,52
NA,run by the business firms by which they,52
NA,"are employed, or will join an approved",52
NA,society set up by an insurance company.,52
NA,"Should that be the case, it is quite",52
NA,ceivable that the wives of many of those,52
NA,men will not come under a proper medical,52
NA,benefit scheme. I know that it will be,52
NA,optional for them to do so; but,52
NA,the - fact will remain that very,52
NA,many of them will not be covered. I,52
NA,feel that we should not be satisfied with,52
NA,any scheme of medical benefits which does,52
NA,not eventually cover the whole of tho,52
NA,"family. Tn saying that, I do not wish",52
NA,to cast any reflection on the benefits made,52
NA,available by the friendly societies. I n,52
NA,"common with other honorable members, I",52
NA,acknowledge and appreciate the debt,52
NA,which the community generally owes to,52
NA,"the friendly societies, which have",52
NA,pioneered this work ancl continued it in,52
NA,a voluntary capacity over a long period.,52
NA,It would be cause for profound,52
NA,regret if this scheme were to interfere,52
NA,in any way with their progress. We have,52
NA,been informed on good authority that that,52
NA,"ha."" uot been the experience in Great",52
NA,"Britain, and we sincerely hope and con-",52
NA,fidently believe that it will not be the,52
NA,experience in Australia. Friendly society,52
NA,dispensaries do net seem to be included,52
NA,"in or adequately covered by the bill, yet",52
NA,"they, too, liave rendered excellent service",52
NA,to the community in a voluntary capacity.,52
NA,They have supplied medicines at a very,52
NA,moderate cost to many people who other-,52
NA,wise would have been unable to procure,52
NA,them. I t is hoped that the Government,52
NA,will be able to evolve a scheme that will,52
NA,make satisfactory provision for these,52
NA,eminently worthy bodies.,52
NA,"Honorable members from Victoria,",52
NA,"unlike those from New South Wales,",52
NA,have not had the experience of,52
NA,opposition to the scheme by members,52
NA,of the medical profession. [Quorum,52
NA,"formprl. | I t is interesting, in view of the",52
NA,protestations that have just been voiced,52
NA,by the honorable member for Hindmarsh,52
NA,"( Mr Makin), to notice the lack of",52
NA,interest of honorable members of the,52
NA,Opposition in the Government's proposal.,52
NA,Apparently they are quite prepared to,52
NA,adopt the policy speech of the Prime Min-,52
NA,ister of New Zealand ( Mr Savage). At,52
NA,the present time there is only one,52
NA,matter which is causing members of the,52
NA,medicnl profession in Victoria real con-,52
NA,"cern; that is, the effect of clause 115.",52
NA,"The request that they have made is, I",52
NA,"con- think, an eminently reasonable one.",52
NA,They find themselves faced with the,52
NA,problem which confronts lionorable mem-,52
NA,"bers, namely, that it is impossible to",52
NA,estimate the effects or fhe consequences,52
NA,of this scheme until we have had some,52
NA,experience of its operation. As a starting,52
NA,"point, thej' are. quite prepared to accept",52
NA,the agreement reached with the Govern-,52
NA,ment; but they point to the fact that,52
NA,under clause 115 no elasticity is permitted,52
NA,to meet any fluctuation of circumstances.,52
NA,"The amount which"" can be allotted",52
NA,on account of medical benefit is,52
NA,restricted to 16s. in respect of males ancl,52
NA,17s. 6d. in respect of females. A capita-,52
NA,tion fee of l i s . has already been agreed,52
NA,"upon. We can assume, I think, that the",52
NA,amount of 4s. which is to be provided for,52
NA,a complete range of medicines and drugs,52
NA,"of first quality, and certain medical ap-",53
NA,"pliances, will prove a very conservative",53
NA,estimate. I understand that friendly,53
NA,society dispensaries have offered to make,53
NA,rjjnt service available at a cost of 3s.,53
NA,a head. One can fairly assume that,53
NA,chemists would not be prepared to accept,53
NA,a lower figure than that; consequently the,53
NA,expenditure already contemplated in,53
NA,respect of capitation charge and medi-,53
NA,cines and appliances is 15s. Then the,53
NA,mileage fee to be paid to the doctor has,53
NA,"to be taken into account, and there will",53
NA,also he a certain amount for the cost of,53
NA,the administration of medical benefits.,53
NA,It is quite obvious that there is no elas-,53
NA,ticity in that particular provision. Should,53
NA,it be found that the amount to be pro-,53
NA,"vided is too small, Parliament itself",53
NA,would have to amend the act to give effect,53
NA,to any recommendation of the commis-,53
NA,sion for an increased payment. I suggest,53
NA,"that, i f the medical profession is prepared",53
NA,to accept tho agreement reached with the,53
NA,"Government, provided its members can be",53
NA,assured of some elasticity in the event of,53
NA,the amount of the medical benefit being,53
NA,"found inadequate, the Government should",53
NA,seriously consider the amendment of that,53
NA,particular provision along those lines.,53
NA,If the existing unfortunate controversy,53
NA,with the medical profession could be,53
NA,"settled in that way, any time spent by",53
NA,the Government in the consideration of,53
NA,the matter would be well repaid.,53
NA,The only other matter to which I wish,53
NA,to refer is that of finance in,53
NA,connexion with the scheme.,53
NA,"should appreciate, and I am sure other",53
NA,"honorable members would also, a state-",53
NA,ment by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) as,53
NA,"to what, in his opinion, will be the effect",53
NA,on our national economy of the with-,53
NA,drawal from circulation of the amount,53
NA,necessary to operate the scheme. In the,53
NA,"first twelve months of its operation, the",53
NA,wage-earners will contribute a total,53
NA,"amount of £5,600,000. The employers",53
NA,"will contribute a similar amount, and the",53
NA,contribution of the Government will be,53
NA,"£2,000.000, a grand total of £13,200,000.",53
NA,That is a very large sum to,53
NA,withdraw from circulation and place,53
NA,in a fund for this particular purpose.,53
NA,I ask the Treasurer to bear in mind that,53
NA,most of that amount would normally be,53
NA,--pent upon consumers' goods. Tt would,53
NA,Mr IT nil.,53
NA,be interesting to know whether the,53
NA,Treasurer considers that the taking of,53
NA,this money out of the pockets of,53
NA,employers and employees is likely to have,53
NA,!)d. any deflationary effect on the national,53
NA,economy. Under clause 105 a board of,53
NA,trustees is to be set up to control the,53
NA,"national insurance fund, but clause 132",53
NA,considerably restricts its range of invest-,53
NA,ment. The trustees are limited to invest-,53
NA,ments made-,53
NA,(n) by the purchase of securities which,53
NA,"have, prior to the mnking of the",53
NA,"investment, been issued by the",53
NA,Government of the Commonwealtli,53
NA,or of the United Kingdom or by any,53
NA,public authority constituted by any,53
NA,act or State act and authorized by,53
NA,that act to issue such security;,53
NA,or,53
NA,(ft) by deposit in the Commonwealth,53
NA,- Bank of Australia.,53
NA,For a number of years the fund will be,53
NA,"of considerable proportions, but the",53
NA,restrictions placed on the trustees in,53
NA,respect of investment.? may lead to a dis-,53
NA,location of the national economy. I n his,53
NA,"report, Sir Walter liinnear touched on",53
NA,this matter when he said-,53
NA,In view of the contractual character of the,53
NA,benefits the fund should be strictly hypothe-,53
NA,cated by act of Parliament for the purpose,53
NA,"of pensions payments, and the money might",53
NA,"be suitably invested in housing, public utility",53
NA,and general local authority schemes.,53
NA,"Apparently, the Government has not",53
NA,accepted that recommendation in its,53
NA,"entirety, because housing has been specifi-",53
NA,cally omitted as a form of investment.,53
NA,I shall be interested to hear the reason*,53
NA,I for his omission when the Treasurer,53
NA,replies. I suggest that consideration be,53
NA,given to the possible effect upon Com-,53
NA,monwealth finance of making available,53
NA,for investment in Government securities,53
NA,"these large sums of money, which other-",53
NA,wise would be expended in the purchase of,53
NA,consumers' goods or in obtaining service,53
NA,for consumers.,53
NA,"This scheme of social service,",53
NA,"added to existing social services, will",53
NA,constitute an enormous field of govern-,53
NA,ment action. I consider that it is unde-,53
NA,"sirable that it should remain as at present,",53
NA,simply a part of the normal Treasury,53
NA,"Department. I n passing, I pay my",53
NA,tribute to the Treasurer for the work that,53
NA,"he has put into the scheme, and the",53
NA,conscientious manner in which he has,53
NA,investigated everyaspect of it. The pass-,54
NA,ing of this measure w i l l be a fitting,54
NA,tribute to the honorable gentleman;,54
NA,"nevertheless, the work is getting beyond",54
NA,the control of any one person. I suggest,54
NA,the creation of a ministry of social ser-,54
NA,"vices, which would administer this",54
NA,"scheme, invalid and old-age pensions, aud",54
NA,"repatriation, and also any expansion of",54
NA,existing schemes along lines already indi-,54
NA,cated by the Government. Until we have,54
NA,one man whose sole responsibility will,54
NA,"be the control of our social services, wc",54
NA,shall not get the best results.,54
NA,I conclude by congratulating the,54
NA,Government upon the introduction of this,54
NA,bill. I agree with the honorable member,54
NA,for Henty ( Sir Henry Gullett) that i t,54
NA,required considerable political courage,54
NA,bring i t before Parliament.,54
NA,recent weeks we have had some experiraised,54
NA,ence of sectional opposition lo certain,54
NA,aspects of the measure. U n t i l the scheme,54
NA,"i3 properly under way, and its benefits",54
NA,"appreciated, there will be further hosthe",54
NA,tility. We should be prepared to give,54
NA,to the Government credit f o r its courage.,54
NA,The consequences of this legislation arc,54
NA,"beyond our present comprehension, but.",54
NA,"if it be well administered, and, parsuspended",54
NA,"ticularly, if its effects be what we",54
NA,"they will be, there need be little doubt",54

NA,garding the government of the Northern,54
NA,Territory and the control of one-sixth,54
NA,of the total area of Australia. It is,54
NA,doubly serious i n view of the recognized,54
NA,value of the Territory and its northern,54
NA,coastline i n regard to defence. During,54
NA,"the last Parliament, i t was decided that",54
NA,the member f o r the Northern Territory,54
NA,should have a vote on the disallowance,54
NA,or acceptance of Northern Territory,54
NA,"ordinances, but the fact that Parliament",54
NA,meets on only a comparatively few days,54
NA,each year makes this vote almost,54
NA,valueless.,54
NA,"I t is vitally important, particularly in",54
NA,to view of the proposed heavy expenditure,54
NA,"During on defence, and of the grave issues",54
NA,"by the Payne Report, that all",54
NA,legislation effecting the Territory should,54
NA,"be carefully .considered by Parliament,",54
NA,and submitted to the early criticism of,54
NA,member for the Northern Territory.,54
NA,"Furthermore, i t would be Avise, since the",54
NA,Minister for the Interior is to visit the,54
NA,"Northern Territory soou, that all legis-",54
NA,lation regarding that area should be,54
NA,pending his visit of inspection,54
NA,hope and the formulation of a policy on,54
NA,"that general lines. Actually, what is happen-",54
NA,preing is that the bureau which governs the,54
NA,to Territory is promulgating ordinances as,54
NA,fast as they can be produced. One ordin-,54
NA,ance-No . 2 of 1938-th e details of which,54

NA,taken in respect of any other part of,54
NA,"Australia, without free public and par-",54
NA,"liamentary discussion, it would probably",54
NA,occasion a nation-wide public out-,54

NA,"matter, notwithstanding that that",54
NA,territory is the gateway of Australia.,54
NA,""" PORT ST .",54
NA,The recommendations of the Payne,54
NA,Committee may be divided into two,54
NA,sections-thos e parts which are palatable,54
NA,"to the department and the Minister, and",54
NA,those which arc not. The first are being,54
NA,quietly introduced by nieans of ordin-,55
NA,ances concocted by a few civil servants,55
NA,"at Canberra, and are not submitted to me",55
NA,or anybody else with independent know-,55
NA,ledge before they become law. The,55
NA,"others arc the unpalatable sections, and",55
NA,it would appear that they will be shelved.,55
NA,I suggest to the Minister that this is a,55
NA,serious matter. I demand that in future,55
NA,the issue of ordinances governing,55
NA,Northern Territory affairs shall be,55
NA,limited to a period immediately preceding,55
NA,the meeting of Parliament; that these,55
NA,"ordinances shall be printed, circulated",55
NA,"among members, and issued to the press",55
NA,in sufficient time to allow them to bo,55
NA,perused and criticized before Par-,55
NA,liament meets; and that when Parliament,55
NA,"meets, a special time shall be set aside",55
NA,for their discussion. I t is of not the,55
NA,slightest use for the Government to,55
NA,wriggle and say that this is not possible.,55
NA,"The legislation for the Avhole of Australia,",55
NA,"MS it appears before this Houso, is con-",55
NA,centrated so that it can be dealt with in,55
NA,"brief sessions each year, and the same",55

NA,is framed by a secret departmental junta,55
NA,"throughout the year, whenever the depart-",55
NA,ment pleases.,55
NA,The Minister proposes to leave for the,55

NA,and has been gracious enough to ask me,55
NA,to accompany him. The last ministerial,55
NA,"visit, as well as many earlier ones,",55

NA,"report in its details; unless, in brief,",55
NA,the Government ceases to treat the whole,55
NA,subject of territory government with,55
NA,"levity, I shall seriously consider whether",55
NA,my conscience will allow me to accept a,55
NA,tour of the territory at public expense.,55
NA,"The time has come, I think, when I",55
NA,should take the gloves off.,55
Mr MAKIN ,"Hear , hear!",55
NA,Mr .BLAIN -Th e honorable member,55
NA,for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) objected,55
NA,"last year, in no uncertain terms, to the",55
NA,manner in which Parliament is kept un-,55
NA,informed as to ordinances passed in,55
NA,respect of outlying territories. I may,55
NA,have to consider whether it would not be,55
NA,better for me to spend my time informing,55
NA,the people of the Commonwealth of the,55
NA,true atmosphere of the Department of the,55
NA,"Interior and of its subterfuges, rather",55
NA,than waste my time-an d that of,55
NA,thousands of my constituents who like to,55
NA,welcome a Minister in good faith-i u,55
NA,acting a3 cicerone to a ministerial party,55
NA,which I am not yet satisfied is going to,55
NA,the north with a genuine desire to settle,55
NA,territory problems. We are too busy,55
NA,ancl too poor in the north to waste time-,55
NA,"on humbug, ancl to conduct pleasure tours",55
NA,of official parties which look us over and,55
NA,return to so-called civilization with their,55
NA,"tongues in their cheeks, to do only those",55
NA,things which make their own jobs easier,55
NA,and improve their own status at the ex-,55
NA,pense of every territorian. I put the,55
NA,whole matter up to the Minister. I,55
NA,"believe that he personally is sincere, but",55
NA,at the present stage of his experience he,55
NA,is still immature enough in Northern,55
NA,Territory politics to be imposed upon.,55
Mr BAKER ,Griffith) 110.24) - I rise,55
NA,in regard to a matter affecting the,55
NA,Acting Minister for Health ( Mr.,55
NA,Archie Cameron). I. desire to know why,55
NA,a question asked by me upon the adjourn-,55
NA,ment three weeks ago was not answered?,55
NA,On that occasion I mentioned that some,55
NA,time previously the Acting Minister for,55
NA,Health had tabled in this House a report,55
NA,by Mr Lewis on tho Canberra hospital.,55
NA,Details of the report were published in,55
NA,"the press, and the document was brought",55
NA,under the notice of the Public Work-;,55
NA,Committee. I t was then disclosed to the,55
NA,committee that a report had been fur-,56
NA,nished by the Canberra Hospital Hoard,56
NA,in reply to the Lewis report. I suggested,56
NA,that the reply made by the Hospital,56
NA,Board should have been made public at,56
NA,the same time as the original report.,56
NA,"Since then, however, a further develop-",56
NA,"ment has occurred. A few days ago,",56
NA,one of the only two elective members of,56
NA,"the Hospital Board, Mr MCFadyen,",56
NA,desired to give evidence before the com-,56
NA,"mittee with regard to this matter, and,",56
NA,despite the fact that at least one member,56
NA,of the committee suggested that he should,56
NA,"be heard, the chairman refused to hear",56
NA,him. I do not suggest that the chairman,56
NA,exceeded his rights in deciding that Mr.,56
NA,MCFadyen should not be permitted to give,56
NA,"evidence, but irrelevant evidence had been",56
NA,given previously by medical men. I f cer-,56
NA,tain persons were entitled to give evidence,56
NA,extraneous to the matter under the com-,56
NA,"mittee's consideration, an elective member",56
NA,of the board desiring to place his views,56
NA,before the committee in reply to such,56
NA,statements should have been allowed,56
NA,to do so. I t so happened that this,56
NA,particular representative was,56
NA,viously prevented from stating his case,56
NA,when the royal commission was in-,56
NA,vestigating the position with regard,56
NA,to the Canberra hospital. On that,56
NA,occasiou ho presented six statements,56
NA,by medical men dealing with what,56
NA,was suggested to be an unsatisfactory,56
NA,position in connexion with medical affairs,56
NA,in Canberra. The chairman of the com-,56
NA,mission decided to go into secret conclave,56
NA,with the other medical men on the com-,56
NA,"mission, and the two lay members were",56
NA,prevented from being present. When the,56
NA,"commission's report was submitted, no",56
NA,reference was made to the contents of,56
NA,the six statements which were severely,56
NA,condemnatory of medical activities in this,56
NA,"territory. I am informed that, after the",56
NA,commission had concluded its investiga-,56
NA,"tion, a request was made to the chairman",56
NA,"that this document should he returned,",56
NA,hut he replied that it had been mislaid. I t,56
NA,is indeed strange that that particular,56
NA,document should have disappeared.,56
NA,What I now have to say will be,56
NA,similar to the statement that the Hos-,56
NA,pital Board desired to place before,56
NA,the Public Works Committee. As full,56
NA,publicity has been given to the views,56
NA,[50],56
NA,"of the critics of the board, I hope that",56
NA,the reply of the board will receive,56
NA,similar publicity. I understand that it,56
NA,has been suggested that the Chairman,56
NA,of the Public Works Committee may have,56
NA,been acting in accordance with a,56
NA,suggestion received from another autho-,56
NA,"rity, when he refused to allow Mr.",56
NA,MCFadyen to give evidence.,56
Mr FRANCIS , I give that suggestion,56
NA,an emphatic denial.,56
Mr BAKER , I merely say that the,56
NA,"suggestion has been made that, tlie chair-",56
NA,man might have been influenced in that,56
NA,way. This representative wanted to make,56
NA,"his statement under privilege, in order",56
NA,to be enabled to reply to other statements,56
NA,which had been made under privilege.,56
NA,The fact that residents of the Federal,56
NA,"Capital Territory contribute about £8,000",56
NA,a year towards the maintenance of the,56
NA,Canberra Community Hospital surely,56
NA,entitles him to that treatment. He sug-,56
NA,gests that the Canberra Hospital Board,56
NA,has transformed the hospital from a,56
NA,"badly-run institution, lacking public con-",56
NA,"prefidence under departmental control, into",56
NA,an efficient and well-equipped unit. In,56
NA,performing this work the board has been,56
NA,"beset with difficulties, the chief of which",56
NA,has been the open hostility of a coterie of,56
NA,local medical officers who have never,56
NA,appreciated the efficient control by the,56
NA,board. I n the course of its administra-,56
NA,tion the board has found evidence of,56
NA,inefficient treatment by certain Canberra,56
NA,medical practitioners from which mem-,56
NA,bers of the public have been sufferers.,56
NA,This evidence has been available to the,56
NA,"board from various' medical officers who,",56
NA,"from time to time, have served at the",56
NA,hospital. A signed statement by one,56
NA,"medical superintendent, covering about",56
NA,"six such cases, was presented in good",56
NA,faith by a member of the board to the,56
NA,"chairman of the, royal commission which",56
NA,"sat at Canberra in. June, 1937. The",56
NA,"commission was composed of two doctors,",56
NA,"two laymen, and a doctor us medical",56
NA,recorder. The chairman of the commis-,56
NA,"sion, a medical man, after consulting his",56
NA,"medical confreres only, refused to permit",56
NA,"discussion on fhe statement, and made no",56
NA,reference to the matter in the findings,56
NA,"of the commission. The lay members,",56
NA,"one of whom was a legal, man, were not",56
NA,permitted to examine the statement. Since,56
NA,the statement was handed to the chairman,57
NA,of the royal commission it has dis-,57
NA,"appeared, and the Canberra Hospital",57
NA,Board has been unable to recover it.,57
NA,"There is every reason for believing that,",57
NA,"in some cases, patients in the Canberra",57
NA,Hospital are still not receiving the con-,57
NA,sideration they are entitled to from cer-,57
NA,tain medical officers. The _ Hospital,57
NA,"Board, in an endeavour to protect it3",57
NA,"patients, ha3 made provision under cer-",57
NA,tain conditions for consultative opinions,57
NA,to be obtained at the board's expense.,57
NA,This method of co-operation in the sole,57
NA,interests of patients is not acceptable to,57
NA,"certain medical officers, despite the fact",57
NA,that the royal commission recommended,57
NA,that patients in the Canberra Hospital,57
NA,be protected on somewhat similar lines to,57
NA,the system now operating. I n this kind,57
NA,of legislation the board is entirely in,57
NA,hands of its medical superintendent. The,57
NA,principle involved in this matter is too,57
NA,important to be overlooked by the House.,57
NA,I t has been admitted by medical officers,57
NA,that the happenings at Canberra are,57
NA,common to the whole of Australia. For,57
NA,humanity's sake a medical officer should,57
NA,not be permitted to undertake work,57
NA,"which is beyond his ability, yet we find",57
NA,the medical profession so situated to-day,57
NA,"that a man with a university degree, and",57
NA,"with little or no practical experience, is",57
NA,in a position to set up in practice and,57
NA,"undertake, without supervision of any",57
NA,"kind, any method of treatment which his",57
NA,ego or financial state may urge. That,57
NA,this is possible is a sad reflection on our,57
NA,governing bodies.,57
NA,It was on these lines that the elected,57
NA,member of the Hospital Board desired to,57
NA,give evidence before the Public Works,57
NA,Committee. Both the Director-General,57
NA,of Health and the Acting Minister for,57
NA,Health are aware of the conditions pre-,57
NA,vailing at the Canberra Hospital.,57
NA,would be interesting to learn whether they,57
NA,are supporting the board in its valiant,57
NA,attempt to protect the interests of the,57
NA,Canberra sick. There is a feeling among,57
NA,certain well-informed people that an,57
NA,attempt is being made to disintegrate the,57
NA,present board with a view to giving medi-,57
NA,cal practitioners the same free play in,57
NA,the hospital that existed under free and,57
NA,easy departmental control. Canberra is,57
NA,without a system of local government; in,57
NA,Mr Baker.,57
NA,"fact, the only responsible citizen govern-",57
NA,"ing authority is the Hospital Board, and",57
NA,this Parliament should see to it that the,57
NA,reactionary interests represented by the,57
NA,board's opponents are not encouraged in,57
NA,their attempts to sabotage the excellent,57
NA,social service rendered by the Canberra,57
NA,Community Hospital Board. I t is only,57
NA,fair that a statement of that kind should,57
NA,be given publicity in this House.,57
NA,Another matter which I desire to raise,57
NA,is the rumour that considerable altera-,57
NA,tions are to be made with regard to,57
NA,the administration of hospital services,57
NA,in Canberra. I t is suggested that an,57
NA,elective board is about to be established.,57
NA,"I am in favour of an elective board,",57
NA,because it represents a democratic prin-,57
NA,"ciple, but 1 trust that the new board will",57
NA,be endowed with powers at least equal,57
NA,the to those possessed by the present board. I,57
NA,also trust that the Assistant Minister for,57
NA,Health ( Mr Archie Cameron) will see,57
NA,that the democratic principle of one,57
NA,person one vote will operate in respect,57
NA,"of this proposed election, and that he",57
NA,will not give rein to any notions he may-,57
NA,have that women are not entitled to vote,57
NA,or are not entitled to stand for election to,57
NA,the board. I trust that despite whatever,57
NA,beliefs foreign to Australian sentiment he,57
NA,"may have upon this particular subject,",57
NA,he will not allow them to influence him,57
NA,in this matter.,57
NA,Another subject which I desire to,57
NA,touch upon has been raised on several,57
NA,"occasions in this House, following a libel",57
NA,case in Canberra. That was a private,57
NA,ease and the Government was not directly,57
NA,"interested in it. Nevertheless, in the",57
NA,"course of those proceedings, certain state-",57
NA,ments regarding the milk supply in this,57
NA,community and affecting the welfare of,57
NA,residents of the Territory were made.,57
NA,They revealed a position which does not,57
NA,It say very much for the vaunted superiority,57
NA,of males over females in the control of,57
NA,important public activities. Although a,57
NA,male is at the head of the Department of,57
NA,"the Interior, no action has been taken to",57
NA,date in pursuance of the evidence given in,57
NA,the case to which I have referred. We are,57
NA,at least entitled to expect efficiency from,57
NA,"the Health Department, and members of",57
NA,the Opposition are entitled to some con-,57
NA,sideration in this regard. As the,57
NA,Assistant Minister has not extended to,57
NA,me the small courtesy of listening,58
NA,"to any part of my speech, I trust",58
NA,that he will read my remarks in,58
NA,Hansard and will give a reply to the,58
NA,points I have raised by to-morrow,58
NA,evening.,58
Mr MCEWEN ,Indi-Ministe r for the,58
NA,Interior) [10.38] -Th e honorable mem-,58
NA,ber for the Northern Territory ( Mr.,58
NA,Blain) referred with rather more than,58
NA,his usual warmth to certain matters con-,58
NA,cerning the administration of the,58
NA,"Northern Territory, including the recent",58
NA,report of the Payne-Fletcher Commit-,58
NA,"tee, and the visit which I propose to make",58
NA,to the Territory at an early date. His,58
NA,first complaint is that before proceeding,58
NA,to the Territory I have acted upon one,58
NA,of the mosjt important recommendations,58
NA,of the Payne-Fletcher Committee. I,58
NA,believe that every honorable member will,58
NA,share my astonishment that the decision of,58
NA,the Government in this respect has been,58
NA,criticized adversely by the honorable,58
NA,member. One of the important,58
NA,recommendations of that committee,58
NA,was that the Land Board should be,58
NA,abolished and that the authority,58
NA,hitherto vested in it should be vested,58
NA,for the future in the Administrator.,58
Mr BLAIN ,Th e Minister knows that,58
NA,he has been given no authority and never,58
NA,will be.,58
Mr MCEWEN ,Th e advisability of,58
NA,acting upon that recommendation has,58
NA,"hitherto been unchallenged by any one,",58
NA,and the action has been taken. I am glad,58
NA,to say that I have found it possible to act,58
NA,OJI certain other recommendations of the,58
NA,Fletcher-Payne Committee before visiting,58
NA,the territory. Every recommendation,58
NA,that i t has been found feasible to put,58
NA,into operation has been put into opera-,58
NA,"tion. Quite recently, for instance, I was",58
NA,"able, acting on the advice of the com-",58
NA,"mittee, to arrange with the Common-",58
NA,wealth Railways Commissioner to reduce,58
NA,most substantially the freights on cattle,58
NA,from Alice Springs to Adelaide. I f i t,58
NA,"were necessary, I could give quite a",58
NA,number of instances where effect has been,58
NA,given to the recommendations contained,58
NA,"in the committee's report. Of course,",58
NA,there are major recommendations in that,58
NA,"report which, if put into operation, would",58
NA,involve the expenditure of many millions,58
NA,of pounds of Commonwealth money. I t,58
NA,is not felt by the Government that it,58
NA,would be desirable to put into operation,58
NA,recommendations entailing such consider-,58
NA,able expenditure and such innovations of,58
NA,policy without a visit to the,58
NA,"territory by the Minister for the Interior,",58
NA,accompanied by certain advisers. I t has,58
NA,"been arranged, therefore, that imme-",58
NA,diately after the conclusion of this,58
NA,"sessional period of Parliament, I shall go",58
NA,"to tho Northern Territory, accom-",58
NA,panied by the permanent head of the,58
NA,"Department of the Interior, the Commis-",58
NA,"sioner of Commonwealth Railways, and",58
NA,certain other persons best competent to,58
NA,give me advice in connexion with,58
NA,projected variations of policy. Fol-,58
NA,lowing the example set by former Minis-,58
NA,ters who have made official visits to the,58
NA,"territory, I have extended an invitation",58
NA,to the honorable member for the Northern,58
NA,Territory to accompany me. He has indi-,58
NA,cated to-night that he may choose not to,58
NA,"accept the invitation and to remain, while",58
NA,"I am in tho Northern Territory, in the",58
NA,"south, talking to the press, I understand,",58
NA,and informing the public of Australia,58
NA,as to his views of the policy of the Govern-,58
NA,ment ancl myself on territory affairs. I f,58
NA,the honorable member feels that that is,58
NA,the best way for him to serve his con-,58
NA,"stituents, we shall leave him to be the",58
NA,"judge. But my invitation is open to him,",58
NA,and I believe that his better judgment will,58
NA,prevail ancl that he will come with me and,58
NA,offer the sound advice of which he is,58
NA,capable in his cooler moments.,58
NA,The honorable member has suggested,58
NA,that ordinances affecting the Northern,58
NA,Territory should not be promulgated other,58
NA,than immediately before the commence-,58
NA,ment of sessional periods of Parliament.,58
NA,Compliance with his request would be a,58
NA,retrograde step involving undue delay on,58
NA,occasions in promulgating ordinances for,58
NA,the better government of the territory or,58
NA,for the introduction of what may be re-,58
NA,garded as new and better policy. I do,58
NA,not propose to recommend to the Govern-,58
NA,ment that his suggestions should be,58
NA,acceded to. The honorable member has,58
NA,pointed out with more warmth than,58
NA,accuracy that neither he nor Parliament,58
NA,has an opportunity to challenge these,58
NA,ordinances when they are made. We all,58
NA,know that that statement is not in,58
NA,accordance with the facts. There is a,58
NA,statutory provision that the honorable,59
NA,member for tbe Northern Territory or,59
NA,any other honorable member of either,59
NA,House of Parliament may within fifteen,59
NA,sitting days after an ordinance has been,59
NA,laid before the Parliament give notice of,59
NA,"motion for its disallowance, and oppor-",59
NA,"tunity is provided at least once a month,",59
NA,"on. private members' day, for such",59
NA,matters to be debated. I t is not,59
NA,necessary for me to remind the House,59
NA,that there was oue occasion when the,59
NA,lionorable member moved for the dis-,59
NA,allowance of an ordinance and did not,59
NA,exercise the right conferred upon him to,59
NA,vote upon his own motion. I am,59
NA,disposed to think that the honorable,59
NA,member has spoken with more heat than,59
NA,consideration to-night. I have no doubt,59
NA,that he will accompany me when I leave,59
NA,"for the Northern Territory, at the end of",59
NA,next month.,59
NA,A question was asked this afternoon,59
NA,regarding the reported boarding of a,59
NA,Japanese lugger by the master of the,59
NA,patrol boat Larrakia-. I have received,59
NA,the log of the. Larrakia covering,59
NA,the period when this incident,59
NA,occurred. The position is that in the,59
NA,"course of normal patrol duties, the",59
NA,"Larrakia, when proceeding within terri-",59
NA,"torial waters, sighted the Japanese",59
NA,"lugger Tabu Muni, which was within",59
NA,territorial waters. The master of the,59
NA,Larrakia hoisted the ensign and the code,59
NA,"Hugs signifying, "" Stop, or I fire "". At",59
NA,"this time, according to the log,",59
NA,the centre engine shaft of the,59
NA,"Larrakia showed, a fracture, and it",59
NA,was necessary to stop this engine and,59
NA,proceed only under the power of the,59
NA,other two engines. As the lugger did not,59
NA,"stop, the master of the Larrakia fired a",59
NA,burst across the lugger's bows. Upon this,59
NA,"being done, the lugger stopped and was",59
NA,bearded.,59
NA,The log records that the lugger,59
NA,"had no pearl shell aboard, and as",59
NA,there was no indication that contact,59
NA,"had been made with the shore,",59
NA,the captain of the Larrakia warned,59
NA,the master of the lugger to keep outside,59
NA,"the three-mile limit, and permitted the",59
NA,vessel to proceed. This concluded what,59
NA,I am advised is a normal action and inter-,59
NA,"rogation which may, in the circumstances,",59
NA,Mr MCKiren.,59
NA,be regarded a3 routine in the duty of the,59
NA,patrol vessel Larrakia.,59
NA,References were also made to-day to,59
NA,reports in the press of an alleged claim,59
NA,for compensation against the Common-,59
NA,wealth by Japanese interests in connexion,59
NA,with this incident. No claim for com-,59
NA,pensation has been made cither at Darwin,59
NA,or at Canberra.,59
Mr SCULLY ,Gwydir) [10.48] - I,59
NA,direct the attention of tho Minister repre-,59
NA,senting the Postmaster-General to unfair,59
NA,treatment meted out to returned soldiers,59
NA,employed as temporary linesmen in the,59
NA,Postmaster-General's Department. The,59
NA,Postmaster-General some time ago said,59
NA,that definite consideration would be given,59
NA,to the claims of casual employees in the,59
NA,"department, who are returned soldiers, to",59
NA,be made permanent. I then made appli-,59
NA,cation on behalf of one of my constituents,59
NA,through the Postmaster-General for him,59
NA,to be made a permanent officer. The,59
NA,application was referred to tho Public,59
NA,Service Hoard. The reply that I received,59
NA,"and passed on to the man was that, as he",59
NA,had not had two years' continuous service,59
NA,"in the department, he was not eligible",59
NA,for permanent employ ment. This man is,59
NA,competent to a high degree. He is a,59
NA,returned soldier with a good record and,59
NA,"has a large family to maintain. I n all,",59
NA,he has had twelve years of casual service,59
NA,with the department and has given every,59
NA,satisfaction. The treatment he has,59
NA,received indicates that it is the definite,59
NA,policy of the Postmaster-General's De-,59
NA,"partment, in order to disqualify men from",59
NA,"permanency, to dismiss them shortly",59
NA,before the expiry of their two-year period,59
NA,of employment and then re-engage them.,59
NA,I. received to-day from a friend of this,59
NA,man a telegram which states that after,59
NA,21 months with the department,59
NA,",he is to be put off, and thereby",59
NA,debarred from applying for per-,59
NA,manent appointment. This policy un-,59
NA,fairly prevents men from becoming per-,59
NA,manently employed. The man had given,59
NA,twelve years of satisfactory service to the,59
NA,department. On every occasion when he,59
NA,was nearing the time when he would,59
NA,become eligible for permanent employ-,59
NA,"ment, the temporary appointment was",59
NA,discontinued. Such procedure is unfair.,59
NA,"After 21 months of continuous service,",59
NA,and twelve years of casual service in the,59
NA,"department, he was put off at a time",60
NA,when work was available on which he,60
NA,i-ould be engaged for three months so as,60
NA,to become eligible for a permanency. I,60
NA,direct the attention of the Government to,60
NA,this unfair procedure in the Postmaster-,60
NA,General's Department.,60
Mr BEASLEY ,West Sydney) [10.52].,60
NA,-Probabl y it is known to most honorable,60
NA,members that during the last few months,60
NA,there have been a number of shipping,60
NA,mishaps on the Queensland coast. Ships,60
NA,have run aground and been damaged.,60
NA,"One of them was the Port <S'f. John,",60
NA,"which, having been towed off a reef, was",60
NA,brought to Sydney for repairs. The ship,60
NA,was put into dry dock at Mort's during,60
NA,"this week, and a survey disclosed that it",60
NA,was in a very bad condition. The,60
NA,workers about to be engaged on the,60
NA,repairs necessary to make the ship sea-,60
NA,"worthy ascertained, soon after the job",60
NA,"had started, that the repairs were to be",60
NA,of a very temporary nature. They dis-,60
NA,"cussed the matter, and were disinclined",60
NA,to proceed with the work under such con-,60
NA,"ditions. The crew, who are. on English",60
NA,"artie'es, are very apprehensive about",60
NA,raking the ship to sea with only,60
NA,"temporary repairs effected, aud their in-",60
NA,fluence on the tradesmen employed at,60
NA,"Mort's Dock was strong enough, at one",60
NA,"-rage, to cause the workers to consider",60
NA,whether they would undertake to do such,60
NA,"temporary work. However, the officials",60
NA,of the organization discussed the matter,60
NA,"at a conference, and the work proceeded,",60
NA,but it was decided to refer the matter to,60
NA,me with the object of bringing it under,60
NA,thu notice of the Government. We wish,60
NA,the Government to state what powers it,60
NA,possesses regarding the certificate of,60
NA,worthiness that fhe vessel must obtain,60
NA,before it puts to sea again. T am advised,60
NA,"that the engine-room is out of alignment,",60
NA,and that the plates are buckled in a num-,60
NA,"ber of places. I n short, the ship",60
NA,K badly damaged. From what can,60
NA,"be gathered, the owners appear to",60
NA,be inclined to carry out only such,60
NA,temporary repairs as putting patches here,60
NA,Miid there and rivets in several places.,60
NA,"Generally, they arc having done what",60
NA,may he regarded as only the bare mini-,60
NA,mum requisite to get a certificate of sea-,60
NA,"worthiness. They apparently, are satis-",60
NA,fied to take the extra risk that will be,60
NA,involved before the vessel reaches its,60
NA,destination.,60
NA,Mr MAKrx -Th e repairs must be,60
NA,passed by Lloyd's surveyor.,60
Mr BEASLEY ,Tha t is so; but I,60
NA,am unaware at the moment of the powers,60
NA,of the Commonwealth Government in that,60
NA,regard. I f it was an interstate or intra-,60
NA,"state vessel, the State would probably",60
NA,"have some say, but it is a deep-sea vessel",60
NA,"with an English crew, and I understand",60
NA,the -crew are sailing under English,60
NA,articles. I received a message about the,60
NA,"matter by telephone a few minutes ago,",60
NA,and the greater detail that I should,60
NA,"like t(? possess, I have not been able to",60
NA,obtain. As we are adjourning a little,60
NA,"earlier to-night, I seized this opportunity",60
NA,"to deal with the subject, rather than to",60
NA,try to embrace such an important matter,60
NA,in a question to-morrow. I ask,60
NA,the Minister to be good enough to inquire,60
NA,as to the powers the Government pos-,60
NA,"sesses, and to inform the House whether",60
NA,the Government can exercise any,60
NA,control over the authority that,60
NA,has the right to issue the certificate,60
NA,of sea-worthiness. I f i t has any,60
NA,"power, will it exercise it to the extent",60
NA,of causing the owners of the vessel to,60
NA,"carry out repairs that are satisfactory,",60
NA,so as to make sure that the lives of the,60
NA,men who are to take the vessel to its,60
NA,destination are not jeopardized? I have,60
NA,authority to speak to-night for the ship-,60
NA,"wrights, boiler-makers, iron-workers, and",60
NA,"engineers, who are associated on the",60
NA,job. They are proceeding with the work,60
NA,"now, but whether they will complete it",60
NA,I am unable to say. They say that the,60
NA,"Government should exercise the authority,",60
NA,"seawhich they hope it possesses, to see that",60
NA,"no certificate is issued, unless the job is",60
NA,properly ' completed. I t is quite,60
NA,natural and necessary that I should em-,60
NA,phasize that the men are anxious that,60
NA,the work should be done in this country.,60
NA,There are many men following this class,60
NA,"of work on the waterfront, and there is",60
NA,not much of it available at the present,60
NA,time. Conditions of employment are,60
NA,"fairly bad generally, and the more work",60
NA,"that can be done in this country, the",60
NA,better pleased these men will be. I be-,60
NA,lieve it is my right to press that aspect,60
NA,of the matter as well. Whilst perhaps the,60
NA,Government may be unable to force,60
NA,the owners to the extent that we might,61
NA,"like-tha t is to say, to the extent of hav-",61
NA,ing the whole of the work clone in Aus-,61
NA,tralia-i t should at least go so far as to,61
NA,insure the ship being properly repaired,61
NA,and made absolutely seaworthy before it,61
NA,leaves Sydney to go overseas.,61
Mr ARCHIE CAMERON ,Barker-,61
NA,Assistant Minister for Commerce),61
NA,[10.56] - I assure the honorable member,61
NA,for West Sydney ( Mr Beasley) that the,61
NA,Government will take all steps necessary,61
NA,to see that the vessel is in a. seaworthy-,61
NA,condition before it is permitted to put,61
NA,to sea. The safety of crews will always,61
NA,be a concern of this Government. Such,61
NA,inquiries as are necessary will be made,61
NA,forthwith to ascertain the true position.,61
NA,With regard to the question of the hon-,61
NA,"orable member for Griffith (Mi . Baker),",61
NA,he referred to the same subject on,61
NA,the motion of the adjournment,61
NA,of the House some time ago. Hav-,61
NA,"ing raised it, however, he immediately",61
NA,"left the chamber, and I thought he had",61
NA,"no further interest in it. '.therefore, I",61
NA,took no trouble to reply. To-night he has,61
NA,"raised the question at greater length, and",61
NA,"I shall reply briefly. First,",61
NA,"have not at any time suggested, either",61
NA,"personally or through a third party, that",61
NA,hospital affairs should be discussed by,61
NA,the Public Works Committee. For what,61
NA,"has been clone by the committee, the com-",61
NA,mittee alone is responsible.,61
NA,Regarding the Hospital Board's reply,61
NA,"to the Lewis Report, my opinion is that",61
NA,"the report, which was made by a member",61
NA,"of the Hospital Commission, was an",61
NA,official report to the Government. Conse-,61
NA,quently we felt that the House was en-,61
NA,titled to see it. Any comments the board,61
NA,cared to make were comments to the,61
NA,Minister for Health. As far as'I am per-,61
NA,"sonally concerned, the honorable member,",61
NA,"if he so wishes, is at liberty to see them.",61
NA,I do not think that there is anything in,61
NA,connexion with the affairs of the Canberra,61
NA,Hospital of sufficient importance to,61
NA,occupy the attention of this Parliament.,61
NA,I f the Canberra people are given a chance,61
NA,to run the hospital as an ordinary demo-,61
NA,"cratic institution, I believe that they will",61
NA,do it very well. The honorable member,61
NA,for Griffith will find in the Common-,61
NA,"wealth Gazette, to be issued this week, a",61
NA,new ordinance containing all the power,61
NA,necessary to make this possible. I do,61
NA,not intend to bring the affairs of the hos-,61
NA,pital before the House to any greater,61
NA,extent at this stage. The present Hospital,61
NA,Board has had a very difficult period of,61
NA,"office, and i t has done its work well. What",61
NA,the Canberra Hospital needs more than,61
NA,anything else is a little peace and quiet-,61
NA,"ness, and freedom from unwelcome pub-",61
NA,"licity, so that it may settle down to do",61
NA,the things that really need doing. When,61
NA,it is given this opportunity I believe that,61
NA,the result will be such that neither the,61
NA,Commonwealth Parliament nor the people,61
NA,of the Federal Capital Territory will have,61
NA,need to be ashamed.,61
Mr CASEY ,Corio-Treasurer ),61
NA,[11.3] -i n reply-Th e honorable mem-,61
NA,ber for Gwydir ( Mr Scully) alleged that,61
NA,1 certain returned soldiers employed as,61
NA,temporary linesmen in the Postmaster-,61
NA,General's Department were being treated,61
NA,unfairly.,61
Mr MAKIN ,Wha t he said was quite,61
NA,true. I know of similar cases.,61
Mr CASEY , I am not personally,61
NA,"acquainted with tbe details of the subject,",61
NA,but I shall bring the matter under the,61
NA,"I notice of the Postmaster-General, and see",61
NA,that the honorable member is informed,61
NA,of the result.,61
NA,Question resolved in the affirmative.,61

Mr CASEY ,"O n Wednesday, the 18th",61
NA,"May, the honorable member for Batman",61
NA,( Mr Brennan) asked the following,61
NA,question:-,61
NA,I desire to ask tlie Treasurer whether he has,61
NA,"noted what I think is an undoubted fact, that",61
NA,the Commonwealth parliamentary debates are,61
NA,printed on paper which is pale and anaemic,61
NA,"and altogether unsatisfactory, and that the",61
NA,print is difficult to read at night? Will he,61
NA,inquire as to whether this is due to difficulty,61
NA,"in securinobetter paper, or is it the fault",61
NA,of the printing machinery?,61
NA,"I have made inquiries into this matter,",61
NA,and I find that it is not possible at,61
NA,present without considerable loss to vary,61
NA,fhe class of paper used for the weekly,61
NA,"issues of the Parliamentary Debates, but",61
NA,"tlmt .steps liave been taken to ensure that,",62
NA,"ns far as possible, there will be an",62

3,Mr FENTON ,"I am obtaining the information, and shall supply it to the honourable member later. NEWSPAPER MISREPRESENTATION .",9
4,Mr YATES ,"I rise to a personal explanation. Last week I made a motion of privilege to bring to the notice of the House the misrepresentation by the Adelaide Advertiser and other journals of my attitude towards the financial policy of the Commonwealth. During the debate that ensued, several honourable members said that I was wrong in complaining that I had beeu misrepresented. In the report of that debate published in the Advertiser, and, presumably, supplied either by telephone or telegraph by its representative in this city, the following paragraph appearedSeveral times during his speech Mr Yates made reference to the paid hirelings of the press. I. hold the proof number of Hansard containing my speech, and I am assured by the Principal Parliamentary Reporter that it is complete, and omits nothing that I stated in the House. It contains not, a single reference to "" the paid hirelings of the press "". However honourable members may differ regarding my com. plaint of misrepresentation on the first occasion, here is evidence of wilful misrepresentation and lying, and I leave it to the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Henty ( Mr. Gullett) and others to justify such misreporting of the proceedings of this House. PRICE OF WIRE AND WIRE PRODUCTS.",9
5,Dr EARLE PAGE ,"The Brisbane Courier of Monday last reported that the manufacturers of wire netting and wire have, pending the issue of new price lists, made the following increases on invoices:Fencing and baling wires, gauges 8 to 14 inclusive, £2 7s. Od. per ton; wire for manufacturing purposes, all classes, gauges 8 to 14 inclusive, £2 7s. Od. per ton; tie wire. 14 gauge only, 2s. (id. per cwt.; barbed wire, all gauges, £2"" 7s. Cd. per ton; nails, including brads, clouts, panel pins, &c, gauges 8 to 14 inclusive, 3s. per cwt.; wire netting, all classes, l i per cent. These goods have been already manufactured, and I ask the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs whether bounty has been paid in respect of them, and whether, as a result of the new duties, a further sum is to be taken from the consumers by means of increased prices?",10
6,Mr FORDE ,"If the right honourable gentleman will let me have those particulars, I shall have them investigated immediately, arid furnish a reply to him as early as possible. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. DISMISSALS or RADIO-TELEGRAPHISTS.",10
7,Mr ELDRIDGE ,"the Posfrmaster-General, upon notice I. Has a number of radio-telegraphists in the service of the department been dismissed upon the acquirement of the A class broadcasting stations; if so, how many? 2. Do the dismissed men properly belong to the broadcasting industry? 3. Is it a fact that they have no other occupation, and have long years of service to their credit in the stations acquired by the Government ? 4. Is it a fact that they hold certificates complying with the Government regulations regarding the qualifications of persons eligible to operate a broadcasting station ? 5. Is it a fact that they did not at any time seek temporary or casual employment in the Public Service in the sense that they came to the Government seeking employment, but that they were taken into the stations when the Government acquired the stations? 6. Is it a fact that they belong to an industry which the Government acquired, and in which the Government at that time had no men in its service properly belonging to' that industry, except the radio inspectors and other administrative officers? 7. Is it a fact that the mechanics in the' permanent service of the denartment, who have apparently been appointed to the positions of these radio-telegraphists', are neither certified nor qualified as required by law or by regulation, nor have any of them ever previously been employed in the industry of radio-telegraphy ? 8. If the circumstances are as stated, has a grave injustice been done to these men justifying their re-employment?",10
8,Mr LYONS ,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Ten attendants who were employed in a temporary capacity at the stations and studios of the national broadcasting service throughout the Commonwealth have had their period of employment terminated. 2. They are in the same category as a considerable number of men who have been employed over varying periods in connection with broadcasting activities during the past five or nix years. 3. It is unknown whether they have other occupations. In some cases the men concerned were employed by the broadcasting companies for periods up to five years. 4. Yes, in some cases. 5. When the stations were acquired by the Government, applications were made by most - if not all-of the companies' employees for service with the department. The department was anxious that the least possible hardship should result from the transfer, and made special efforts to take into its service as many as possible of the companies' employees. It was made clear to those concerned that their employment would be of a temporary character. 0. The Government did not acquire an industry. It has so far taken over only five stations. At the present time there are 28 broadcasting stations operating in the Commonwealth, and licences have been issued for ten more stations. The department has a considerable number of men in its service, quite apart from radio inspectors and other administrative officers, adequately equipped with technical knowledge and training to enablethem to perform all duties in connection with broadcasting activities. 7. The department's officers employed on broadcasting work have the necessary qualifications and competence to undertake the duties efficiently, and they arc not engaged in any manner contrary to the law or the regulations. It is probable that most of them have not heen previously engaged in the industry of commercial radio-telegraphy. 8. It is regrettable that circumstances are well known have forced the department to dispense with the services of many valuable officers employed in a temporary capacity, but it would bo quite wrong to say that any injustice has been done to the men in question.

11,Mr ELDRIDGE ,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. On what date was the tender for relay broadcasting stations accepted? 2. Was the contract made for the live stations together, or for the various stations separately ? 3. What was the price for each of the five stations? 4. Did the successful oversea tenderer's price include the work of installing any or all of the stations? 5. Did the unsuccessful Australian tenderers' prices include the installing of the stations ? 6. Did the unsuccessful tenderers in their quotations make allowance for masts of - a greater height than the successful tenderer? 7. Did the unsuccessful Australian tenderer* include in their quotations provision for more expensive and/or higher quality engines and/or power plant than the successful ten-, dercr ? 8. Would the power plant offered by the unsuccessful tenderers have been more economical in operation than that being installed by the successful tenderers? 9. In what other respects did the unsuccessful Australian tenders differ from the tender of the oversea company which secured the contract? 10. In view of the statement of the Prime Minister before leaving Australia that if possible he would cancel the contracts for the five relay broadcasting stations, will the Postmaster-General state whether the contract for any or all of these stations has been cancelled; alternatively, will he state whether it is possible to cancel the contract for any of these stations? 11. Will the Post muster-General state exactly what stage of development has been reached in respect of each of these contracts': 12. Does the Postmaster-General still consider it is' in the public interest that details of these contracts should not be disclosed?",11
12,Mr LYONS ,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:- . 1 and 2. The contract was let for two stations on the 13th September, 1929; for two further sets on the 211th February, 1930; and for MI additional set on the 15th August, l 3 0 . 3.

The successful tenderer's price included the cost of supervision 'during installation. 5. Not completely. A certain amount of departmental labour was required to be supplied. (i. One unsuccessful tenderer quoted for 150 feet masts; another for 200 feet masts; and the successful tenderer for heights ranging from 130 feet to 260 feet depending upon the wave length and the types of radiating systems offered. 7. The cost of the power plant offered by one of the unsuccessful Australian tenderers was less than that of the successful tenderer, and the other unsuccessful tenderer offered plant at a higher price. The successful tenderer's plant is of the highest quality. 8. No. !). In respect of guaranteed ulliciency and economy of operation. 10. The order for one broadcasting station has heen cancelled. 11.

15,Mr FRANCIS ,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Has the installation of the mail-handling appliances at the General Post Office, Sydney, been completed? 2. If so, what is the cost of the completed work ? 3. Is the scheme working with complete satisfaction? 4. What will be the savings, if any, in the cost of handling mails?",12
16,Mr LYONS ,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes; but necessarily minor adjustment and changes will be needed from time to time to gain the full benefits resulting from worki ig experience. 2. The total cost is approximately £120,UoU, but the final figure cannot be known u i i ' i l the whole of the accounts have been dealt with. 3. Yes. 4. The savings cannot be stated at this juncture. Necessarily, such a radical change of method entailing the use of the most comprehensive plant ever constructed necessitates a reasonable period of working experience 1 efore the full procedure can settle down to a stable routine basis.",12
17,Mr TULLY ,"the Postmaster General, upon not i c e technical 1. Is the mail-handling equipment at the General Post Office, Sydney, working satisfactorily? 2. Is there any delay in transit of articles posted at the General Post Office, Sydney? 3. Is it a fact that articles posted at the General Post Office, Sydney, are being mutilated in some cases beyond repair? 4. Has the introduction of the mail-handling plant entailed any overtime; if so, to what extent ? 5. Is it a fact that the noise made by this mail-handling plant is such as to cause nervous breakdown amongst employees; if so, to what extent? 6. Is it a fact that mails now close at 4.45 p.m. at the General Post Office, Sydney, instead of at 5 p.m., as when business was carried on at the Central Square? 7. If such is the case, what is the reason? Is it due to deficiency in the mail-handling plant? 8. How many mechanics are employed in order to keep this mail-handling plant running? If there are mechanics employed, who bears the expense, the Government or the contractors ? 9. What is the cost per week for electricity supply for this machinery?",12
18,Mr LYONS ,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. Yes; but as is common to new machinery installations, there has been a necessary period of adjustment. 2. _ No. There were some isolated instances arising from unavoidable dislocation of traffic incidental to the removal of mail operations from Central Square to the General Post Office. 3. This does happen in some cases, and always has happened. Over a long period of years appeals have heen issued to the public for the butter packing and fastening of mail matter. Many articles are posted in flimsy wrappings insufficiently protected, and are consequently unavoidably damaged. 4. The only overtime expenditure incurred an connection with the introduction of the plant - was £53. The removal of the Mail Branch - from Central Square to the General Post 'Office, on Sunday, 12th October, however, eieeessitated the employment of a special staff of 210 men in addition to the normal staff of 82 men, the total Sunday pay involved being £530. It would have been impracticable to effect such a radical change otherwise. 5. No. 8. Yes. The heavy peak, load pf postings about 5 o'clock has been substantially increased by the opening of the Kyogle route between Sydney and Brisbane, and the department had either to keep the main body-of the staff on duty until possibly 7 p.m. or alter the closing time slightly. 7. See answer to No. 0. 8. Four, and five assistants. In addition, fifteen men are engaged temporarily on adjustments and minor charges found to be desirable under working conditions. No individual contractor was responsible for the installation. Such maintenance and other work a3 may be needed is paid for by the department. 9. The information is being obtained.

20,Mr BLAKELEY ,"The answers to honourable member's questions are as follow:l . Joint Commonwealth and State electoral rolls arc in operation in the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. - 2. .Representations have been made from time to time to the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia with a view to co-operation in this matter. The Premier of Queensland has intimated that it is intended to provide for a uniform roll during the next session of Parliament. In Western Australia during the past five years a bill to bring about a joint electoral roll has on three occasions been passed by the Lower House, but in each instance the bill was defeated in the Legislative Council. In response to further representations by the Commonwealth Government, the Premier of that State replied on the 8th August, 1930, that the matter was being held over, hut would receive consideration at a later date. The public advantages of the joint system arc fully recognized by the Commonwealth Government, and every effort is being made to induce the States of Queensland and Western Australia to come into line with the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.

21,Mr FENTON ,"I am advised that, in conformity with a resolution carried at a conference of State Premiers in Sydney in May, 1929, a conference of State marine officials was held in Melbourne towards the end of last year for the purpose of discussing what action, if any, should be taken in regard to legislation on the lines of the Commonwealth law on the subject. It may be mentioned in this connection that, in December, 1929, a committee consisting of Captain L . J. Bolger, Deputy Director of Navigation. Victoria, Mr B . Wallach, B.E., Director of Lighthouses, and Mr J. Malone, M.I.R.E. , Chief Inspector (Wireless), the Postmaster-General's Department, f u r nished a report on the question of the suitability, for use on small coasting vessels not equipped with wireless apparatus operated by qualified operators, of an automatic wireless device submitted by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for transmitting signals of distress. Copies of this report were forwarded by the Prime Minister to the Premiers of the States on the 16th January, 1930. In acknowledging receipt of the Prime Minister's communication, the Premier of Western Australia pointed out that all vessels plying on the coast of Western Australia were equipped with wireless apparatus. I am communicating with the Premiers of the other States with a. view to ascertaining whether any developments have taken place in connection with this matter, and will make the information available to the honourable member as soon as possible. Mr D . CAMERON asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a terminal charge of Is. will be made on messages transmitted or received by means of wireless equipment on small vessels plying in Australian waters? 2. If so, will such action bring about the dismissal of wireless operators?",13
22,Mr LYONS ,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. Yes.

BELL asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeWhy, in appointing a representative of the fruit-growers on the Sugar Inquiry Committee, Mr W. Young, the Queensland nominee, was preferred to Mr R.

32,Mr LATHAM ,"Kooyong) [3.15J - For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth a second financial statement, which is in effect a second budget, has been made in the same year by a government. When this Government introduced its budget in July last, a motion was moved from this side of the House declaring that the expenditure of the Commonwealth ought to be brought down to the level of that of 1928-29, and the amount proposed reduced by, at least, £4,000,000. The arguments that we used in support of that motion were derided and scoffed at by members on that side of the chamber; but now the Government has come before the House with the admission that the expenditure must be substantially reduced, and the contention that taxation should be increased. Everything that was said by or on behalf of the Opposition in July last, during the budget debate has been confirmed by events. There could be no stronger confirmation than the statement of the Acting Treasurer, that in the light of results to date a deficit of between £12,000,000 and £15,000,000 was possible if things were allowed to drift on the basis of the presentarrangements, and trade and unemployment became worse; but that with a restoration of confidence and a revival of trade, the deficit would be between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000. fore, so recently as three months ago, this Government had not the slightest idea of the true condition of the Commonwealth finances. On the figures given, a restoration of confidence and a revival of trade are estimated, by the Acting Treasurer to be worth between £4,000,000 and £5.000,000 to the Commonwealth revenue. What has brought about the position set out in the financial statement of the Acting Treasurer? The cause is partly a. further fall in the prices of the principal commodities that we export, such as wool, wheat and minerals; but largely, a general lack of confidence throughout the community. The Acting Treasurer himself referred to the importance of a restoration, of confidence, but one of the principal factors in bringing about the existing condition of affairs has been and still is a lack of confidence in the present Government. - Just a year ago the Labour partyassumed office with a large majority, fresh from a successful election, full of confidence and arrogance. Where is it today ?",16
33,Dr EARLE PAGE ,Lickin g its wounds.,16
34,Mr LATHAM ,"This year has beon a year of almost unmitigated disaster for the people of the Commonwealth, and that is largely due to the policy or absence of policy of this Labour Government. Its members may well have lost conn dence in themselves. They were warneu about the position before the last election. They knew the relevant facts, but paid no heed to the warnings that were given. They came into this House full of promises. They promised to give everybody the sun, the earth, the moon and the stars. To-day we find them grovelling in the mud. In May of last year the hue Government outlined the financial and economic position :is it saw it and as it truly was. Therefore, the present Government cannot say that it was not warned, and had not the means of informing itself of the actual position of affairs. But, determined to ignore facts, and resolved on winning the elections somehow or anyhow, the Labour party went to the people merrily and said that no changes need be made. At the Premiers Conference in May of last There- year, Mr Bruce reviewed the public finance of Australia, setting forth the deficits in _ Commonwealth and State budgets. J it said that an increase of taxation would probably defeat its owu object. Has this Government yet learnt that lesson? The budget introduced in July last proposed increases of taxatior. amounting to £12,f>50,000; and we now have before us the admission that, if that budget be adhered to for the remainder of the year, the deficit on the operations of the year may be between £1.2,000,000 and £15,000,000. Mr Bruce also pointed out that there had been. a. fall in the prices of wool, wheat and metals; that wo had less income to spend, and that consequently we would have to be content with less. It was not a question of anybody wanting to take less. So far, the Government has hardly recognized the diminution of national income, although it has given bore expression to if in both the last and the present financial statement. It was pointed out by Mr Bruce if we were to have a chance of maintainhappens ing our standard of living, it was essential that we should reduce the cost of duction. That is still the position Australia; we have to recognize it, the people have to appreciate it if proswages perity is to return. It was pointed out, further, that expenditure could not continue upon the then existing scale, but had to reduced. Mr Bruce said that, unless the country. this position was faced, unless economic facts were recognized and policy was ordered in accordance with the factors governing the situation, the native was a diminution of our national wealth and an increase of unemploybelieve ment until, faeed with a national crisis, we would be forced to lower our standard tics can ensure high wages. of living and readjust the whole of national life. It was pointed out, both in this House and at the Premiers' ference, that certain steps would have be taken to deal with the position. I was because of the steps that the last Government proposed to take that the wonderful party which now sits opposite had its glorious victory at the elections held in October, 1929. It was pointed out last year that, the country were placed on a sound read a very short extract. He saideconomic basis, our standard of living would be threatened, and eventually would decline. Wheu the national income any becomes less-and it is becoming lesswe have all to take less; that appears to action. me to be simply a m'atter of arithmetical calculation. These propositions were quite untruly represented as advocacy of the reduction of wages. Every honourable member of this House, I believe, wants wages to as high as possible. But if sufficient money is not available there ' cannot the same national dividend as has hitherto been enjoyed. The last Government made certain proposals with respect to the reduction of expenditure in the Publio Service. Every honourable member opposite who then sat on this side of the House, and I think I am fairly safe in saying all of those opposite who are newly in this House, loudly proclaimed that those who how sit on this - side were attacking the allowances of public happen to have reached. servants. Apparently they are still persisting with the old idea that standards Mr Latham. that, can be maintained at any rate which to have been reached, irrespective of whether or not there is enough promoney to meet the requirements of ID the situation. During the election camand paign the Labour party contended that bore no relation to economic facts; that they were to be maintained whatloan ever happened, and that they should be fixed as a matter of . political policy be independent of the prosperity of Until our people learn the that such a policy is both impossible and. absurd, the affairs of this country will never be placed on a sound alterbasis. The Labour party has induced a large number of people in Australia to that they can procure anything they want by voting for it, and that poliThe last our federal election, and the recent New South Wales election, are perfect demonConstrations of the acceptance of those to absurd propositions by a considerable t proportion of the population of Australia. We have to discard those propositions. Recently, Mr Winston Churchill, who always writes and speaks interestingly, delivered at Oxford an address on ""Parliamentary Government and the Econounless mic Problem "", from which I propose to ; It must be observed that economic problems, unlike political issues, cannot be solved by expression, however vehement, of the national will , but only by taking the right You cannot cure cancer by a majority. What is wanted is a remedy. That is what we in Australia have to learn today; we must recognize that there are economic limits to political action. I am not suggesting that we are be unable to produce economic effects and consequences by political action; but I be do say that there are certain economic conditions which constitute limits to political action, and that we are in the presence of some of those limits at the present time. The Labour party, however, stands for the denial of these intelligent and intelligible principles, and for the affirmation of the principle that, irrespective of the prosperity of the country, wages and salaries and other rewards can be maintained at any figure that they At the last election that party promised work for all, the maintenance of high wages, no reduction of Public Service salaries and allowances, and the continuance of the system of Public Service arbitration. Yet it has now wiped out Public Service arbitration. First of all the Government got together representatives of the unions, and told them that if they applied to the Public Service Arbitrator it had not the money with which to pay substantial increases, and that, therefore, it was of no use for them to go to the arbitrator. Then the Public Service Arbitrator retired from his position, his period of appointment having expired. There is no Public Service Arbitrator at the present time, and Public Service arbitration has been abolished by the Labour party itself, notwithstanding the fact that at the last election it secured thousands of votes by promising to maintain the system and by falsely representing that the then Government proposed to abolish it. What has happened in and to Australia in one short year of Labour rule? I have already said that it has been a year of almost unmitigated disaster. I use the word "" almost"" because I think that the result will be to convince the peopleindeed, they are becoming convinced day by day-that the rainbows held before them in the dim distance by the Labour party are unreal and can never be made real by Labour policies. Let us examine what has happened to this country which has now suffered under a Federal Labour Government for twelve months - If there was one thing about which the Labour party professed concern, it was unemployment, and when in opposition it charged the Government of the day with being - responsible for all the unemployment that - existed.",16
35,Dr MALONEY ,-And so it was.,18
36,Mr LATHAM ,"I observe that there are still some honourable members opposite who believe that. I shall not follow the - example of the honourable member who interjected by charging the present Government with being responsible for all the unemployment that at present exists. It is true, however, that unemployment has increased .during the regime of this Labour Government from 12.1 per cent, to the terrible total of 20.5 per cent. The Labour Government promised work for all, and yet, after one year of office, one-fifth of the registered trade unionists of Australia are out of work. The reduction of wages spread over the whole body of workers has been a great deal more than '20 per cent. Rationing of employment is only another form of unemployment, a humanitarian variation. If we consider the rationing figures in conjunction with the unemployment figures, we arrive at a truly staggering total, and this condition of affairs has come about during the regime of a government which promised the electors in its circulars and speeches that it would find a solution for the unemployment problem. As a matter of fact, unemployment is worse now than it has ever been before within the memory of any one present. On this ground alone, apart from anything else, the Government has lost the confidence of the people, and even of those supporting it. It has shown that it made false promises in this House. It made promises which it cannot now carry out, and which it is making no attempt to carry out. Let us turn now from the subject of unemployment to that of credit. The credit of Australia is lower today than it has ever been before in the history of the Commonwealth. That has been achieved during twelve months of Labour government.",18
37,Mr MARTENS ,"The Leader of the Opposition and his party have themselves done much to injure the country's credit. They are always crying "" stinking fish "".",18
38,Mr LATHAM ,"Evidentl y the honourable member-would have us refrain from stating the truth. Australia's credit, measured by the London price of Commonwealth bonds, the criterion adopted by the present Prime Minister and the . Acting Treasurer, declined from the very day that this Government took office. The constitution of the Government was such as to make it impossible for it to command the confidence of sensible and responsible people, and so the price of bonds went down. For several years before the last election their price had been from 1 to 4 or 5 per cent, below that of New Zealand bonds, but in July last the price fell to 15.$ per cent, below. And the Treasurer informed us the other day that the London price for £100 Australian bonds was £75 5s., a decline of something in the region of 25 per eent., as compared with New Zealand bonds. There is no confidence in the present Government, no confidence either in Australia or anywhere else, in its wisdom or in its fairness. All the facts point in that direction. Every criterion we can adopt, every standard we can apply, indicates the same thing. The difficulties arising from this general lack of confidence have been aggravated by recent decisions of the Labour caucus to which publicity has somehow been given. Only the other day there was published a resolution which apparently emerged from a body of men who regard themselves as responsible and intelligent. It was couched in these termsThat the Commonwealth Bank be required to create sufficient credit, as and when required, for the following purposes:[a) Finance the requirements Couunonwealth Government in connection all services covered by Parliamentary appropriaafraid, tions. (Zi) Meet that proportion of internal loans maturing during the financial year not otherwise been provided for. That is, £27,000,000 before the end of this year, and £76,000,000 before the end of next year.",18
39,Mr MAXWELL ,Is that authentic?,19
40,Mr LATHAM ,"I understand that it is. The report has never been challenged. The resolution continues(c) Provide for financing State and Commonwealth loan works programme up to a limit of £20,000,000. (rf) Provide financial through the Commonwealth Bank, trading banks, State financial institutions and, if .necessary, through insurance companies, to be used for productive purposes in primary and secondary industries. Evidently there will be money to throw away, money for any one who will take it. There is to be no l i m it except that' not more than 5 per cent, is to be charged for the money. If we add £65,000,000the amount of parliamentary appropriations-to the £76,000,000 and that total to the further £20,000,000, and tack on to that the unlimited amount of financial accommodation - which is to be provided, we have some measure of the inflation which this resolution contemplates. ""What government is going to impose unpleasant taxes when it has a warrant merely to print notes? It is much easier to print notes than to collect taxes. What government is going to borrow money or what person will lend money to the Government when the Government can provide for loan works as well as for ordinary services simply by creating credit through the issue of notes ? These proposals would involve, if they were put into operation, the robbery of every citizen who has a Savings Bank deposit or an insurance policy; the robbery and r u in of wage-earners, and, indeed, exactly what the Prime Minister ( Mr Scullin), before he lef t Australia, said they would involve-increase d unemployment up to 1,000,000 persons instead of something over 250,000 persons. Then we have another contribution to the establishment and maintenance of confidence in the Commonwealth! It is a resolution proposed by the honourable of the member for Bourke ( Mr Anstey), the with Minister for Health-bu t not, I am of financial health-in the present Ministry. This resolution, carried only which has the other day, is as follows:That legislation be passed immediately compelling bondholders in the £27,000,000 loan maturing in December, to hold their bonds for a further period of twelve months, interest to be paid as usual, with the proviso that persons in necessitous circumstances may receive immediate payment of small amounts by cashing thbir bonds at the Commonwealth Bank, the same to be held as non-interest-bearing security, the onus of proving that the circumstances j u s t if y payment, to f all on the bondholders. I presume that honourable members accommodation opposite who voted for that motion believed in it . I am prepared to give them credit for sincerity if not for intelligenceof a high order. This is another proposal for inflation, and inflation involves repudiation. If that motion were carried into effect a man who had lent the Commonwealth money in good faith on the credit of the nation, and received in return for it a bond containing a promise to pay, might be told when, in due course, he came along to get his bond cashed: "" Oh, we will give you another promise to pay in twelve months "" . Of what use is such a promise after the first has been dishonored? It has been left to the Labour party to give these shocks to the confidence of the public in Australia and beyond our own boundaries. A fte r only twelve months i i i office the Labour party has hauled down the Australian flag and dragged it in the mud. This is the first British dominion in which any responsible political party has ever advocated repudiation. For the first time in history a British Minister, speaking from the same platform as an Australian Prime Minister, has thought it necessary to pay the latter the compliment of saying, in tones of mingled admiration and surprise, that he, at least, is an honest and honourable man-as I believe he is. The comparison between the Prime Minister and some members of the party which he is understood to lead is obvious. It has been left to the Labour party to bring about the present condition of affairs by proposing public and calculated dishonesty for the first time in the history of a British dominion.",19
41,Mr SPEAKER ,"Order ! The honourable gentleman is out of order in speaking of any action of members of this this House as ""calculated dishonesty"".",20
42,Mr LATHAM ,"I withdraw the statea ment. Enterprise is nearly dead in AusThis tralia. This Government had nearly killed it when the New South Wales elections internal came and gave it almost the finishing Mow. The unemployment which is ramexpenditure, pant has been created largely by this Government, or has resulted from of confidence which this Government has engendered by its policy, or absence policy; by its vacillation, hesitation delay. We now have before us the Acting Treasurer's financial statement. Every ledge one who reads it must observe that it divided into two parts, the second part of which by no means fits the first part. Throughout the second part of the statethey ment the marks of compromise, and unsatisfactory compromise at that, are apparent. The first part of the statement evidently stands as it was originally prepared, and it is sound. I .congratulate the Government upon possessing some members who are trying to do things sound and honourable lines. But what is being done in that direction is being done too late, and not enough of it is being done. If the Government faced its difficulties earlier some of troubles which now loom before us would never have occurred. In the first part of his statement the Acting Treasurer has a good deal to say about the present general financial position of Australia. I agree with practically every word of that part of the statement. The honourable gentleman has reminded us that in June last the then Treasurer said that it was essential that the budgets of the Commonwealth aud the States should be balanced in the forthcoming financial year. He then reminded us that in his budget speech last July the Prime Minister and Treasurer said that no further drift in the Commonwealth finances could be permitted. But what has happened during the last three or four months? Nothing but drift and delay. The Acting Treasurer went on to quote the following resolution which the Premiers Conference adopted in Melbourne on the 21st August:That the several governments represented at conference declare their fixed determination to balance their respective budgets for the financial year 1930-31. and to maintain similar balanced budget in future years. budget equilibrium will be maintained on such a basis as is consistent with the repayment or conversion in Australia of existing debt maturing in the next few years. Further, if during any financial year there are indications of a failure of revenue to meet immediate further steps will be taken during the year to ensure that the the lack budgets shall balance. The Commonwealth representatives of at the conference voted for that and motion because, no doubt, it was regarded as sound. I presume that the motion was agreed to with a full knowof all the facts. In the light of that is knowledge the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed to balance their budgets this year. They did not consider that were agreeing to an impossibility; but it may be that this Government has created a partial impossibility by their delay in giving effect to the resolution. The Acting Treasurer mentioned in his statement that the deficit in the Commonwealth accounts for the quarter ended ou 31st September last was no less than even £6,747,000. That sum is about equal to the accumulated deficit for the past three years. It was rightly pointed out that had those figures could not be regarded the as a fair measure to be applied to the whole financial year; but the Acting Treasurer went on to say that a deficit of anything from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000 might result from the year's operations unless changes were made. The figures published subsequently for October duced the deficit in the accounts £5,900,000. It appears from the Acting Treasurer's statement that a deficit £9,000,000 may occur in the estimated customs revenue during the year. That exactly what the Opposition said would occur, but the opinion was received laughter by honourable members opposite. The sales tax - may return about £1,000,000 less than was anticipated.",20
43,- Mr LEWIS ,The Prime Minister said that that might be so.,21
44,Mr LATHAM ,"The Prime Minister said that he intended to balance the get, and if the honourable member Corio will take the trouble to read - right honourable gentleman's remarks durtralian ing the budget debate and the debate the sales tax measures and the Approway priation Bill he will find that my statebeen ment is correct. The Opposition lenged the Government's figures, in regard to both revenue and expenditure, and events have thoroughly justified the chala lenge. While the sales tax may return to the Treasury about £1,000,000 less was anticipated, there is likely to be increase in pensions expenditure of £400,000.",21
45,Mr LEWIS ,The Leader of the Opposition should read the Prime Miuister's speech.,21
46,Mr LATHAM ,"The honourable memportion ber for Corio apparently does not appreless ciate the fact that the budget figures - the Prime Minister balanced; yet we now told by the Acting Treasurer that unless there is a restoration of fidence and a revival of trade and employThe ment there will be a deficit of between £12,000,000 and £15,000,000 this year, and with the restoration of confidence the revival of trade a deficit of between £8,000,000 and £10,000,000. Parliament has been called together again because the Government had not enough sense act on the advice given by this side the House in July last. The London position is serious There, an amount of £38,000,000 is outstanding. The Treasurer, in budget speech in July, said that the tence of this overdraft was likely to prove ' seriously embarrassing. The position is worse now ; yet the Acting Treasurer has given the House no information as to rewhether any steps are being or can be to taken in accordance with the amended budget proposals to remedy it. If the of problem had been tackled in August the aifficulty would not have arisen. Had is the Government immediately set to work to reduce expenditure by £4,000,000 the with London debt would have been funded readily ere this, with the result that about £20,000,000 would have been released by the Commonwealth Bank. According to the Acting Treasurer's statement, overdrafts and advances due to the Commonwealth Bank in London amount to about bud- £20,000,000. If that debt had been for funded a corresponding amount would, the have been available for financing Auspublic works and industries. That on would have been a proper and honourable of releasing credit, and could have utilized had the Government acted chalpromptly as it promised to do. The Acting Treasurer, after showing net short-term indebtedness in Australia of £7,134,000, dealt with the banking than position and showed that the banks have an strained their resources to the limit in about order to finance Australian industry. According to the statistics quoted by the Acting Treasurer the proportion of .advances to deposits was 95 per eent; adding Government securities, which are really loans to the Government, the proof advances to deposits is not than 105 per cent. In the light of of those figures nobody can truthfully say are that the Commonwealth and trading banks are not doing their utmost to finance conthe present requirements of Australia. national income, the Acting Treasurer stated, has dropped since last year by £70,000,000, representing the decrease and in the prices of wool, wheat, and metals, and the smaller amount of money coming into Australia through external borrowing. This estimate leaves out of account to the annual turnover of income. Every of £1 received by the farmer for his wheat becomes part of the income of the storekeeper and merchant in that year, and we indeed. can safely say that the national still income was between £100,000,000 and his £150,000,000 lower than it was in the exisprevious year. Now we are told that in the immediate future the income from wool and wheat will be even lessWool is now averaging about 9d. per lb., compared with Is. 3d. for the clip of last year and Is. 7d. for the clip of the previous year, and the price of wheat f.o.b. Australia is less than 3s. a bushel, as compared with about 5s. a bushel last year. Inevitably there will be a further serious decline in the national income. In those circumstances the Melbourne agreement between the Commonwealth and the representatives of the States was made and the Premiers subscribed to it , trustbetter, ing in the good f a it h of the Commontheir adequacy. wealth Government. According to the official report of the conference the Acting Prime Minister statedThe Federal Cabinet had also agreed that the budget shall be balanced this year, the position will be watched carefully, that steps will be taken at the earliest moment necessary to adjust the position; firstly, reduction in expenditure, and secondly, any other savings"". adjustment of taxation required to be made so as not to encroach on the State field taxation. The proposals contained in the second half of the Acting Treasurer's financial statement last week do not honour the terms of the agreement. Honourable members will find a complete change of matter, and almost of tone, in the Acting Treasurer's statement commencing at "" Expenditure proposals "" . The honourable gentleman had earlier saidAt the Premiers' Conference the Minister announced that any necessary important issue. revision of the budget would provide firstly for a reduction of expenditure and that justments of taxation would not encroach on videsthe State fields of taxation. The proposals now submitted are as far as practicable in keeping with this declaration. I propose to examine the proposals with a view to discovering whether they are in keeping with the Prime Minister's declaration. I suggest that at this point in the Acting Treasurer's speech common sense ended and compromise began. "" The honourable gentleman's proposals follow a statement made by the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr Fenton) on the 3rd October after a meeting of CabinetCabinet has discussed the whole financial position. The proposals to balance the budget portions - of the -' act. submitted by the sub-committee were cussed and .approved substantially as presented, f t was agreed that expenditure might be reduced at the rate of approximately £4,000,000 per annum. The honourable gentleman went on to say that Parliament would assemble on t h * 30th October, and that the Parliamentary Labour party would meet on the 27 th October. It is obvious that the party overruled the Government, for the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons) is proposing, not a reduction of expenditure at the rate of £4,000,000 per annum, but what purports to be a reduction at the rate of slightly more than £3,000,000 per annum. The Government's proposals may have to be accepted in the absence of something but we are entitled to examine The Acting Treasurer mentioned various proposed savings on the Estimates amounting to £1,230,000, but no inforthat mation is given as to how these figures and are arrived at. For instance, we are not told how £375,000 is to be saved in respect by a of "" miscellaneous works and services and There is nothing to of indicate the nature of the savings, and whether, in fact, they can be realized. The Acting Treasurer proposes also to apply to the expenditure of the year £1,950,000 of amounts that rightly belong to the sinking fund . This cannot be claimed as a reduction in expenditure; it is merely a device to enable the Government to continue living on substantially the same scale and to avoid providing for the redemption of the public debt. The proposed raid upon the Prime sinking fund raises a difficult and Section 9 of the adNational Debt Sinking Fund Act pro(1) The Treasurer shall pay into the Trust Fund, under the heading of the National Debt Sinking Fund(g) All moneys received in respect of reparations under the Treaty of Peace with Germany. (2) . . . one half - of the net profits derived by the Commonwealth Sank of Australia on or after the 1st day of July, One thousand nine hundred and twentythree, shall be paid to the National Debt Sinking Fund. The Government proposes to repeal those Commonwealth disloans are issued on the basis of prospectuses upon the bona fides of which members of the puhlic are invited to lend their money to the Commonwealth. The prospectuses vary. One issued by Commonwealth Bank in London on the 1.6th January, 1929, statedAll Commonwealth loans carry si. sinking fund in accordance with the provision National Debt Sinking Fund Act which provides, inter alia, that a sum equal to por cent, shall he provided each financial That is an undertaking that payment will be made to the sinking fund us provided by Commonwealth legislation. Another prospectus issued in London May, 1929, statedAll Commonwealth loans carry a sinking fund in accordance with the provisions National Debt Sinking Fund Acts. In that instance there is no limitation of 10s. per cent. Tho final illustration I quote is a prospectus issued by the present Government in Australia on the 3rd February, 1930. paragraph 10 which statesSinking fund contributions will be paid the National Debt Sinking Fund in accordance with the requirements of the Commonwealth law. That does uot mean Commonwealth law as altered from time to time at the will of Parliament; if it did, the paragraph would be farcical, deceptive, and valueless. I fear that the proposal to repeal portions of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act will have a very disadvantageous effect upon Australian credit. Obviously without breach of faith Parliament can repeal paragraph g and sub-section it can repeal all the provisions until no Commonwealth. security in the form of a sinking fund left, except the financial agreement as applies to loans floated in behalf of States. Then, in addition to these alleged savings there are proposals for increased taxation by way of customs and excise, but I doubt very much whether the result will be to add to the revenue at all. Take for example the increased excise on tobacco. In Melbourne tobacco is today selling cheaply, because of a tobacco war, but when the effect of an increase in excise come taxation. to 9s. or 9s. 3d. is. realized, the price of tobacco must increase subprovide stantially and its consumption fall wage. appreciably. It is doubtful whether the estimates of the Acting Treasurer will be realized in any of their particulars. do not propose to examine in detail the customs and excise provisions, but I say. Mr Ijatham. the as .1. said in August last in this House, that .1. cannot 3ee that they will bring in the estimated revenue. .1. now come to the income tax proof the visions. We have before ussome most 10s. remarkably discriminatory proposalsyear. proposals which, I venture to say, are most scandalously unjust. The exemption in the case of income from property is to be reduced to £ 100. An alteration is being made in the rate of tax on income from in personal exertion and property. I have with me some estimates showing the effect in Victoria of these changes. Take an of the income of £400 a. year from personal exertion. Last financial year the State and Federal income tax paid in such a case was £6 4s.; this year it will be £13 2s. Now take the same income earned from property in Victoria. Last year the income tax paid to the State and the Comof monwealth was £10 10s.; this year it will be £56 6s. In the case of an income into of £500 from personal exertion, ihe increase in taxation is from £11 10s. to £20 5s., but on the income from property the tax is increased from £18 8s. to £'74 5s. An income of £200 is to be exempt from taxation if earned by way of personal exertion, but if derived from property in the way of rents from a cottage or two, or interest, on money earned as a result of thrift and saved over many year3, the tax is to be £21 14s. if The fixing of this low exemption in the case of property income is most unjust, 2, and will impose hardship all over the Many Australiansis we probably all know some of them-hav e it a strong sense of personal pride and in the dependence, and have saved throughout their lives in. order that in their declining years they may be independent of the old-age pension. I am glad to say that there are thousands of these citizens, yet they are to be hit by this tax, and brought down below the living wage. I do appeal to the Government to reconsider this unjust proposal to alter inMONICA",21
47,Dr MALONEY ,It would be fair to for no reduction below the basic,23
48,Mr LATHAM ,"There should be some substantial alteration. It is a mistake to I think that income from property represents the income of a lot of millionaires. One has only to look at the shareholders lists of banks and trading companies, and at the lists of bondholders in Commonwealth and State loans, savings bank loans, Board of Works loans and the like, to realise that there are a large number of very thrifty people in Australia. The best indication of that is the deposits in the savings banks. There are some 4,000,000 depositors in the savings banks of Australia, including, of course, a large number of children - who are learning thrift in their early years. These citizens, excluding of course, the children, will be hit, some of them most cruelly by these proposals. Then, in strong contrast, we come to the ""proposal of the Government with respect to the Public Service. Under this special legislation, every public servant receiving a. salary of £725 or under is to be exempt from any reduction. The proposed rate of tax on salaries of between £725 aud £1,000 is 10 per cent., from £1,000 to £1,500 12$ per cent., and above that 15 per cent. Let us consider the operation of this tax. The man in receipt of £725 will lose nothing, but the man in receipt of £800 will, lose £75. Can there be any justification for such a scheme? This is class taxation of a. most exagger : uted character. What, reason can there be for drawing the line at £725? I refusf to believe that members of the Public Service-larg e numbers of whom I know personally-woul d resent a fair all-round proportionate and graded reduction. Their own self.respect would lead them, at least those with whom I am acquainted, to accept a reduction of salary in these troublous times. Yet we find this Government introducing class legislation. It says that it is not, reducing salaries. It , of course, would never reduce salaries unless it could be reasonably sure that the people at whom it hits are not its own political supporters. The men in tin? Defence Department who cannot join a union have had their work rationed, but those who Belong to unions have not been rationed. Only the non-unionist members of the Public Service-som e of whom have applied for admission to unions and have been refused-ar e to have their salaries reduced. This Government refuses to reduce the salaries of any body of meu who are its own political supporters. This Government promised at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne that the budget would be balanced first by the reduction of expenditure.",23
49,Mr WATKINS ,Why did not Mr. Bavin carry out his promise?,24
50,Mr LATHAM ,"Mr Bavin was responsible for a reduction of S-l/3rd pei' cent, in public service salaries in New South Wales. Mr Lang, merely to get votes, promised to restore those salaries. That was one of the most contemptible political promises ever made, and I hope that it will be the last example of its kind. The Labour party, because of its lavish and irresponsible political promises is now being brought up against the inexorable logic of facts. The people are realizing that they have for years been deceived by the Labour party, that ii has a so-called policy which can only be put into operation when there is plenty of money to spend. It has no real political principles. The people will doubtless realise this position before Mr Lang has been in power very long. This Federal Government uow proposes that public servants in receipt of over £725 are to suffer a reduction in salary, but those receiving under £725 are to remain untouched. The hypocritical pretence is being made that salaries are not being reduced, bur. that a tax is being levied. In any case the public servant affected is to get less salary. The tax is to be subtracted before he receives his salary. I suppose that there are some honourable members who think that they can deceive themselves by this vain pretence. It is obviously a hypocritical device to hide the inevitable reduction of salary. It is, however, significant that expenditure throughout the Public Service is being maintained substantially a.t its old level of about £11,000,000'. Mr Hogan, the Labour Premier of Victora, relying upon the good, faith of the Federal Government that it would also do an. unpopular thing, is carrying through the Victorian Parliament at the present time a reduction in the salaries of public servants of from 5 to 20 per cent. He is prepared to do an unpopular thing in order to carry out his word. Unfortunately, this Government is not prepared to keep faith with Mr Hogan. Take the Labour Premier of South Australia, Mr Hill. .Does any one tliink that he relishes reducing Public Service salaries by 10 per deficit will be much greater. cent.? Not for one moment; yet he is of time granted.] doing that. Other State Premiers are doing it too; but I refer particularly to Labour Premiers, because I should have thought that this Government would keep extent of at least over £1,000,000. faith with politicians of their own Let me say one further word in respect of this remarkable action of the Govern the ment in drawing a line at salaries of £725 per amium. In answer to a question that F. put to the Acting Prime Minister NA information to the effect that the numpaper be printed""ber of permanent employees in the Commonwealth Public Service is 28,855; with temporary and exempt employees, 4,179; total, 33,034. The members of naval, more military and air forces number 5,959; of other employees, 5,459; total, 11,418. bourne."" Combining the Public Service and the naval, military and air forces, the total number of Commonwealth employees is over 44,000. I also asked the Acting Prime Minister how many persons in those classes were in receipt of salaries of £725 and over. The answer is that, apart from 112 members of Parliament, that the number is 491, includiug 50 rationed military omcers, who are outside the of the taxation scheme. That leaves 441 persons, out of some 44,000 government employees, effected by this taxation, Australia representing - just about 1 per cent. Does arrangements any honourable member in this House expenditure, believe that this taxation is fair in prinfices ciple or in its results? I conclude by saying that the Governsubstantial ment ought to have carried out the agreesections ment made by the Prime Minister in Melbourne. It. was not a casual agreeceedsment; but an agreement made as the result of a special Cabinet meeting held (ices at the Prime Minister's own home. I say first that the Government has not done ing what it promised to do; that other sacrifices governments are doing unpopular things,believing that the promise of this ment would be carried out. This Governadopted ment has, therefore, broken faith with States. Judging by what it has done, it will certainly fail to balance the budget. On the Acting Treasurer's own figures, even if all his anticipations are realized,there will be a deficit of over £1,000,000', and, if his anticipations are not realized, Mr Latham. as I fear indeed will be the case, the [Extension The Government should not budget for a deficit as it is doing to the admitted I kin. think that the amount will be much greater. The Government may not have the money to meet its obligations. As banking position is strained to the utmost, the budget must be balanced. The Government's proposals will not result in this being accomplished. I move as an amendment to the motion "" That the That all the words after "" That "" be omitted a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" the Government should introduce proposals closely in accord with the agreement made by the Prime Minister with the Premiers the States on the 21st August last at MelDifficult as it is, that is the only path to follow. I think it was the Acting Prime Minister who said-r-hi s utterance was assented to by other Commonwealth Ministers-as reported on page 11 of the oflicial report of the Melbourne conference The members of the conference represent all governments of Australia. Their decisions have been arrived at apart from party or political considerations, and with the sole desire to avert the danger which threatens The carrying out of these will unquestionably involve a heavy diminution in both revenue and loan and will require substantial sacriou the part of all sections of the community Do the Government's proposals involve sacrifices on the part of all of the community? I contend that they do not. The statement proBut the voluntary acceptance of these sacri; is, in the opinion of the members of the conference, the only possible way of avoidthe infinitely greater and more prolonged that would be involved in any failure to meet our national obligations. GovernI am glad that the Government has some of the principles agreed the upon in August last, and that in particular it has invited Ministers and members of this House to make a sacrifice in the matter of their allowances. I am also glad that the Government, in spite of its repudiation of such a proposal only three months ago, has seen the wisdom of this action, and has had the good judgment to submit this proposal to the House. The only sure path to follow is that laid down at the Melbourne conference. It is the path of honour and the only path that will lead us to prosperity. NA I second the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham). I was not at all surprised at the summons which came to honourable members to meet before Christmas to assist the Government in revising its budget proposals. I was, however, surprised at the delay which occurred between the holding of the financial conference in Melbourne in August last, where the Prime Minister met the State Premiers, and the meeting of Parliament. Three months ago honourable members on this side of the chamber urged the Government to reduce its expenditure by at least £4,000,000 annually; but the members of the Government and their supporters placed a blind eye to the telescope and pretended that they did not see any necessity for any reduction in expenditude. I told honourable members at the time that, although they were trying to evade their responsibilities, they could not avoid facing the situation for any length of time. I informed them that as sure as the harvest would ripen the position would have to be faced. We have now been called together to do something, inadequate as it is, before the harvest has ripened. The financial statement presented by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr . Lyons) is a pitiably feeble effort to meet nn unprecedented financial situation. I do not believe that the Acting Treasurer is himself satisfied with it . I think that if he had been permitted to have his own way he would have introduced measures more likely to assist in overcoming our financial difficulties. The reductions which are foreshadowed in this amended budget are hopelessly insufficient-the y are ludicrously inadequate. If it were necessary s a few months ago to reduce expenditure by £4,000,000 annually in order to bring us back to the level of last year's expenditure, it is of even greater necessity today. The steps which the Government proposes to take, represent the last word in feebleness and f u t i l it y , and disclose extent to which the Government has departed from the budget proposals delivered in July last. How immeasurably have they fallen short of the Prime Minister's ( Mr Scullin) words. The Prime Minister, in introducing his budget in July last, saidParliament must recognize, however, that no further drift in Commonwealth finances can be permitted, and that the balancing of the budget is an essential step for the restoration of the credit of Australia. The Government proposes to watch the financial position closely throughout the year, and without waiting until the end of the financial year will not hesitate to take immediate steps if such action appears to be necessary in order to prevent any serious disturbance in the budgetary position. We have not merely the Prime Minister's word; but the Government's decision in the resolution which it assisted to carry at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers a month later. That resolution readThat the several Governments represented at this conference That is the Melbourne conference declare their fixed determination Their fixed determination! The word "" fixed "" appears to have been entirely forgotten by the Government. The statement continuesto balance their respective budgets for the financial year 1930-3.1, and to maintain similar balanced budgets in future years. A little further on the report states- Further, if, during any financial year there is an indication of a failure of revenue to meet expenditure immediate further steps will be taken during the j'ear to ensure that the budgets shall balance. The Government has abandoned its own resolution. It has gone back on the words which the Prime Minister used in introducing the budget in July last. It has gone back on the resolution unanimously carried at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in August last. Apparently, the Government realizes that it cannot carry out the resolution which it supported except by calling upon all members of the community to make substantial sacrifices; but this it has not the moral courage to do. This Government prefers to break its word rather than run the risk of losing votes. It declines the to carry out what it undertook to do in July and August of this year. The Government trembles before the voting strength of the Public Service. The proposals of the Government embody a scheme to impose additional income taxation on those in receipt of a salary of £14 a week and over. The figures given in reply to a question asked this afternoon show that only 1 per cent, of the members of the Public Service enjoy such a salary. What of the other 99 per cent.? One is reminded of a passage in the Scriptures which tells us that one lost sheep was for the time being of more moment than the other 99 within the fold. .Did the members of the Government have this in their minds when considering this proposal or was it the salvation of the 99 votes that actuated them? Last week the Acting Treasurer saidTliat the community generally is at present in II state of inertia, and is awaiting a lead source. from some responsible authority to restore confidence. That lead should undoubtedly come from the highest representative body in ihe community, which is the Commonwealth Government. The Government recognizes this responsibility. The first need in the circumstances is that the Government sliould take steps for the balancing of the budget. The Government does not propose to act upon that principle. It is not giving a lead to the community. No one can say that the proposals outlined in the revised budget can in any sense be regarded as a lend to the community. Neither can it be contended that the steps proposed to be token under the revised proposals will result in balancing the budget. Government is deliberately aiming at a further deficit. The Government's aims is to add to the accumulated deficit, and then, like Micawber, to wait for something to turn up. Does the Government seriously anticipate that the revenue will be greater next year, and that it will be easier then to overcome the obstacles now confronting it than it is this year. The merest tyro must recognize that the revenue from income taxation, for instance, will be smaller next year than it is this year, for the simple reason that income taxation is invariably based on the earnings of the previous year. will pay income taxation this year based on their earnings of la3t year. A large number will pay a fairly substantial amount this year based on last year's earnings, who will pay practically nothing next year. If the Government thinks that it will be able to balance the NA budget next year when it cannot do it this year, it is doomed to disappointment.",24
51,Mr MAXWELL ,"Perhaps it does not anticipate being in office next year. NA It is certain that no government could have been more spineless-and that is a flattering term-in dealing with a difficult situation. Customs revenue cannot reasonably bo expected to be better next year than it has been this year. The arguments which apply to income taxation can also be used in connection with customs revenue. Importations are usually the result of income obtained by business firms in the preceding year, and it is, therefore, extremely improbable that we can expect any immediate improvement in the revenue from this Next year will undoubtedly present its own difficulties without those associated with a deficit this year. The Government should take immediate steps to balance income and expenditure in conpresent formity with the Prime Minister's announcement in July, and with the resolution which the Acting Prime Minister and other Ministers assisted to carry at the Melbourne conference in August last. A man can bo excused for living beyond his income for one year, because he may suffer from an unexpected reduction of his income in that year. He may be excused also for proceeding on the old basis of expenditure for the second year, The if he has a reasonable expectation of his income quickly reverting to its normal state. But if he continues to live beyond his income for a considerable number of years there is nothing ahead of him but insolvency. That is just what the Government is attempting to do; it is not even making an attempt to balance its budget, but is endeavouring to live beyond its income. For the last three years, unfortunately, we have had deficits. In each of those three years-tw o under the administration of the Bruce-Page Government, and the last under the administration of the / People present Government-effort s were made by the treasurers to balance their budgets. They did not anticipate, nor did they aim at, producing deficits. This year, however, we are in the extraordinary position that the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons) is deliberately budgeting to spend from £1,120,000 to £8,120,000 more than he will receive. He himself has told us that if trade should revive, aud if his most sanguine expectations should be realized, we may expect that, ou the basis of the budget which was brought down in July, there will be a deficit of from £S,000,000 to £10,000,000. He has told us, further, that if the existing depression should continue aud there should be no improvement, we may expect that, on the basis of the July budget, there will be a deficit of from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000. That means that, in the event of his most optimistic estimate being realized, the best that ho can hope for is that his proposals in the financial statement that he delivered last week, will leave him with a deficit of £1.120,000; but that, on the other hand, if his worse estimate should prove to be true-and I profoundly hope that it will not-unde r this amended budget we shall have a deficit of £8,120,000. We have no right to further mortgage the future in that way. The savings and economies, as they are called, which are set out in the revised budget at page 8, total, in round figures, £1,230,000. If the Acting Treasurer's estimate of the gap which must be bridged in the event of trade not improving should prove to be correct, those savings and economies, on the basis of the July budget, represent a saving of only one-twelfth of what needs to be saved, which is equivalent to l d . for every Is., or Is. Sd. in the £1. In addition, the Government proposes to divert certain moneys that are now applied to the sinking fund. The diversion of those moneys, to the extent of a little under £2,000,000, will represent a reduction of the maximum deficit by 2s. 6d. in the £1. It is dangerous to tamper with any sinking fund provision. I recognize, however, the extraordinary difficulty in which the Government finds itself, and I would not be too critical of its action in taking today is applied to the sinking fund in excess of the 10s. per cent, stipulated in the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, provided that that amount was ear-marked to be applied to the sinking fund of the States' debts. As honourable gentlemen well know, the Commouwealth provides one-third of the sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per cent, which has to be provided on State debt that existed prior to the commencement of rhe financial agreement. Upon all new debt incurred by the States through the Loan Council' subsequent to that date, the Commonwealth provides one-half of the sinking fund and the States the other: half. If the Acting Treasurer would undertake to see that this money which he proposes to divert from Commonwealth sinking funds, portion of which is obtained from the profits of the Commonwealth Bank, and portion from reparation payments, is ear-marked to provide that portion of the sinking funds of the States provided by the Commonwealth, I would not be unduly critical of his proposal in n difficult period like the present. Reparation payments, particularly, ought to be used in that way. The Acting Treasurer's difficulties would uot be increased in the slightest degree; it would merely mean that money which formerly was applied to Commonwealth sinking funds in excess of the statutory 10s. per cent, stipulated by the financial agreement would replace money that the Commonwealth would otherwise have to find to provide its quota of the sinking funds of the States. I hope that the Acting Treasurer will give consideration to my suggestion. I have stated that the savings and economies foreshadowed in this revised budget amount to only Is. 8d. in the £1 of the amount required on the assumption that we have the tremendous deficit which the Acting Treasurer has forecast, should the present depression continue, and that the diversion of sinking fund moneys represents an additional. 2s. 6d. in the £1. The new taxation proposals, which total £3,700,000' for the eight montlis of the financial year that remain, represent about 25 per cent., or 5s. in the £1. Those three items in the aggregate total 9s. 2d. for every what, £1 which the Treasuror would require in the event of his worse, expectations being realized. No provision whatever has been made for the other 10s. lOd. in the £1. On the other hand, if the Acting Treasurer's most optimistic estimate should prove to be right-and I hope that it will-w e shall still have a deficit of from £1,120,000 t.o £3,120,000. Assuming rhere is a revival of trade, and a realization of the honourable gentleman's best estimate, he has budgeted to bridge the gap of from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000 to the extent of something under £7,000,000; therefore, he has budgeted with his eyes open for the deficit that I have mentioned in the event of his best hopes being realized, and for a deficit of from £5,120,000 to £8,120,000 in the event of his worse fears being borne out. Surely, the very least that could be expected of any government in such a position, even though only eight months of the financial year remain, was to budget to make income and expenditure balance on the most favourable estimate. Indeed, that would not go nearly far enough. It is the duty of the Government r,o endeavour to secure a balance upon figures taken at least at a point half way between the estimated minimum and maximum deficits. Had the Government budgeted to balance its accounts on the expectation that the figures would be adverse to the extent of mid-way between the Treasurer's best and worse estimates, we could have supported it with a little more enthusiasm than we can now. To do that, it would be necessary so to cut expenditure that, in the remaining eight months of the financial year, there would be an additional saving of £4,000,000, equivalent to £6,000,000 in a full Undoubtedly, that would be very drastic action; but I believe that we have reached the stage when it ought to be taken, and that if it is not taken a very much more drastic reduction will have to be made next year. The reduction that I have suggested would involve a 20 per cent, cut on all controllable Commonwealth expenditure. If it were made immediately we might be able to continue permanently on that basis; but I believe that if be not done now, next year we shall have reached such a pass that possibly a 25 per cent, or even a 30 per cent, cut will be absolutely inescapable, and a degree of hardship will be inflicted which can be avoided if the Government will take its courage in its hands and do the right thing. Why does the Government persist with its Micawber-like attitude of waiting for something to turn up to enable it to carry on indefinitely upon a basis of expenditure that is far beyond our present means? It has no ground NA whatever for expecting that next year's revenue will be even nearly so good as that of this year. Certainly, next year's income tax receipts, which will bo based on this year's income, will be very much lower than this year's collections, which will be based on last year's income. Therearc in this community persons who still will not realise how much poorer as a nation we are today than we were two or three years ago, when the prices of the commodities that we produce in largequantities for export were so much higher than they are now. But, surely the combined intelligence of Ministers is sufficient to enable them to realise that fact. It must be obvious to any one who thinks at all, that Australia's national wealth is almost entirely, or at any rate very largely, dependent upon the values placed by the world upon the huge exportable surplus of our staple products, and that any fall in world prices which affects those commodities, affects us as a nation. There has been a tremendous fall in the world's prices for almost all commodities, manufactured goods or raw materials, and the people of all countries are feeling the effects of this decline in values. We in Australia are suffering to a greater extent than are the people elsewhere, for the simple reason that values for the paryear. ticular commodities which we produce for export have fallen further than those of other commodities. The prices for manufactured goods have come down somewhat;. but to nothing like the extent of the fall in prices of raw materials. Thus our primary producers have been hit harder perhaps than other sections of the community. It is only when we examine in some detail the current prices for the commodities which Australia produces for it export that we realise fully how serious' has been the diminution in OUT nationalincome, as compared with our positiononly two or three years ago. As is well known to all, our principal export commodity is wool. For about six years prior to 1929 our average wool cheque was in the neighbourhood of £70,000,000. This year it will be about £30,000,000. In other words, as regards wool alone, the loss in our national income will be approximately £40,000,000. Wheat ranks next in value among our principal export commodities. It is difficult, at the moment. to assess the average price which will be received for our exports of wheat this year; but I believe that we shall have to be content with at least 2s. per bushel less than we have enjoyed in recent years. If , as seems likely, our exportable surplus this year should be .150,000,000 bushels, a reduction in price of 2s. per bushel will mean a further drop in income of £15,000,000. Another important export commodity is dairy produce. Butter today is selling at 6d. per lb. less than at the corresponding period of last year. If our exportable surplus this year should be in the neighbourhood of 54,000 tons- I do not consider this an over-estimate, because our exports have been as high as 65,000 tons and the average is' about 40,000 tons- a decline of 6d. per lb. will represent a further loss of £3,000,000. Fruit and meat prices also have fallen lately. So also have world's values for metals of all descriptions. The Commonwealth Year-Booh for 1926-27 shows that our export of metals, the product of mines and quarries in Australia, in that year were £20,000,000. That figure has been cut at least in half this year, because spelter has fallen from £25 per ton to £14 per ton, and lead, copper and tin have also declined seriously. Except for comparatively insignificant items our exportable products are almost wholly made up of wool, wheat, dairy produce, meat, fruits, and metals, and it is safe to assume, from the figures which I have quoted, that our national income this year from the pastoral, agricultural, dairying, meat, fruit and metal industries will decline by between £60,000,000 and £70,000,000'. Probably the figure will be £70,000,000. In 1927-28, we received from the sale of these products £132,000,000, so the decline in value represents a reduction in our national income of about 50 per cent, for the same volume of goods. We have to ask ourselves if this is merely a passing phase in our trade position, or if it is likely that the markets these commodities will so suddenly recover that we shall be iustified in maintaining governmental expenditure at the same rate as hitherto. I think that prices for these commodities must recover somewhat, for the simrjle reason that present values are so far below the cost of production that unless some upward tendency occurs soon large numbers of producers and manufacturers in all countries will be driven out of business. But he would be a very sanguine man-in deed he would be a super-optimist-wh o predicted a full recovery in the value of these products to the levels of the last few years. I think that possibly prices will recover to the extent of two-thirds the rates ruling in recent years. If my assumption is correct, it is obvious that the prices for all manufactured goods, and the cost of services generally, must be forced down to the new level of two-thirds the average prices for our staple exports during the last two or three years. If this is done, we shall be able to continue to produce for export; if it is not done, our primary producers will be unable to carry on. Unfortunately, this Government is taking no steps whatever to assist in bringing about, at the earliest possible moment, a proper relationship between the prices of manufactured goods and the cost of services, and the prices of primary products. On the contrary, its action, lately in imposing high tariffs and embargoes has had the effect .of retarding any tendency to a proper adjustment in the relationship of commodity prices and cost of services. Indeed, the present Government seems to be anxious, not merely to keep the prices for all manufactured goods and the cost of services at the old level, but, if possible, to increase them. A question was asked in this House this afternoon about the cost of fencing wire, a commodity largely used by our primary producers. It had relation to a report in the press only the other day that the manufacturers of fencing wire and wire netting were increasing their prices practically to the extent of the duty imposed on fencing wire in lieu of the bounty. To encourage the manufacture in Australia of requisites essential to primary producers, former governments legislated for the payment of for bounties in preference to the imposition of customs duties, thus ensuring that price levels should approximate free trade import rates. This policy was to the advantage of primary producers, who have to sell their commodities in open competition in the world's markets. But this Government recently made a drastic uIteration.' It withdrew the bounty payments and imposed, instead, customs duties, with the inevitable result that pricesof fencing wire, galvanized iron, ; &c, are now being increased to the limit permitted by the tariff. It is clear to all that this Government does not really appreciate its obligation to our primary producers, who, today, are practically without a living wage, owing to the serious decline in world's prices for their wool, wheat, and other exportable products Formerly the people as a whole through the Government, bore some portion of the burden of carrying on these secondary industries on an artificial basis. Now it appears that the primary producer and the users of these commodities will have to bear the whole of it. It should be the duty of this Parliament so to modify the tariff as to make it possible for costs of production in secondary industries to be brought to a more reasonable price relation to the value of our export staple products. The recent Increases in customs duties, and the imposition of super taxes, have beeu retarding the natural fall in price levels. Wc have heard a good deal lately about the need for equality of sacrifice. I agree that this is very desirable. Already the primary producers, as I have shown, have suffered heavily owing to the tremendous drop in the world's prices for their exportable surplus products, and I suggest that some sacrifice should now be expected of those who cater for the needs of our farmers. I have lately had brought under ' my notice some extraordinary examples of hardship, and I shall cite one or two instances to bring home to honourable members the true position of primary producers. Recently, when I was touring through a wheat-growing district in New South Wales, I met a number of returned soldier wheat-growers. I asked one of them what his own crop was like, and, in reply, he said that if rain had come three weeks or a month earlier he would have had a magnificent crop, but, as things were, he would find it hard to carry on. explained that a day or two prior to my visit an oflicer of the Rural Industries Board-the body which, in New South Wales, finances returned soldiers in NA fanning operations-ha d inspected his farm for the purpose of estimating the value of his crop. This oflicer told him that, owing to adverse weather conditions, he could expect no return from one-half of his cultivation, and a bag per acre from the other half., Mr C. RIMY - What district did the honourable member visit? NA bidgee area. The representative of the - Rural Industries Board told this young man that, judging from the appearance of his crop, if rain had come a month earlier he would have had twelve bags to the acre. This returned soldier, I may add, was not grumbling at his ill fortune. He merely stated the facts, and was accepting the blow with remarkable fortitude. Another instance that came under my notice was the plight of two young men, who had invested £16,000, representing the whole of their capital, in the purchase of a small station property two years ago believing that wool-growing would continue to be profitable. As the full purchase price was .£43,000, they arranged a mortgage for the balance, and also borrowed sufficient to stock the property. They had obtained two seasons' wool clips; but the price obtained was so low that the other day these young men interviewed the man from whom they had borrowed the money and advised him to take over the property, as they could not possibly meet their interest liabilities this year. Although these young men had iost the whole of their capital, they were not complaining; but, like the returned soldier wheat-grower, they accepted the inevitable with praiseworthy courage and philosophy. I now invite our honourable members to consider the sacrifices that have been and are being made by thousands of primary producers such as these young men to whom I have alluded, and compare their position with that of the public servants of New South Wales, some of whom are complaining bitterly about a cut of S-J per cent, in their salaries. It is amazing, to my mind, that this Government is not taking He some action to ensure equality of sacrifice so far as that is possible on the part of every person in the community. The effect of the increased duties, super taxes, and embargoes which liave been placed upon imported goods has been to retard the natural fall in price of manufactured articles, a fall which would be desirable for many reasons, and would bring them more into conformity with the prices of our exportable products. We were told some time ago that the embargoes and increased duties had been imposed with the object of improving the trade balance; that that policy was not governed by ordinary economic considerations, but represented special action taken by the Government to meet a particular emergency. Some of us asserted"" at that time that the very high rate of exchange, together with our poverty as purchasers, would be quite sumcient to restrict imports without the imposition of super taxes and embargoes. That has been proved. Only the other day I saw some authoritative statistics which showed that the decline in our imports has taken place in almost exactly the same proportion in those goods which come into the country duty free, as in those upon which increased, tariff duties have been imposed. The only successful method of increasing the volume and value of our exports - and I take it that all honourable members feel that the best means of getting out of our financial difficulty is to increase our export production-is to bring about lower production costs. That cannot be achieved with the present tariff millstone a bout our necks. Some of the flat rates of dnty which have been recently imposed for protective purposes are, compared with the ordinary ad valorem duties, absolutely absurd in the light of the present fall in the value of the goods. Flat rates, which possibly represented 40 per eent. or 50 per cent, previously, now represent as much as 100 per cent. Our first duty as a parliament is to remove crushing customs duties from the essential machinery of production. I should like to impress on. the Government the absolute impossibility of encouraging exports uncier the existing tariff policy. people believe that our trade balance and overseas credit can be best improved by greater production for export. I am one of those who believe that. There are others who seem, to cling to the belief that the only way to improve our trade balance is to restrict imports by raising the tariff, thus increasing the cost of production. The restriction of imports by means of an ever-increasing tariff has the effect of putting a brake on export by adding to the cost of production. To ask men to increase production for export in order to improve the exchange position, and at the same time increasing their costs by the imposition of prohibitive tariffs-to ask them to open up new markets while prejudicing those markets against them by embargoes and an absurd tariff vo\ioy-is like requiring a horse to pull a load up n steep hill, and at the same time putting on the brake in order to keep the vehicle from slipping back. If we maintain the prices of manufactured articles in this country at a higher level than prevails anywhere else in the world, it must have the effect eventually of debasing the standard of living in Australia. Some persons argue the opposite, but my contention is that if high prices be maintained many articles which ought to be in the homes of the poor people, as well as in those of the well-to-do, will be quite out of the reach of the great mass of the people. Therefore, the standard of comfort must be lower than it ought, to be. I believe that only in a policy of sane tariff reform leading to lower costs does there lie any hope for the future. If such a policy be followed, we may expect to have our people re-employed at the best wages that Australia can provide for them, taking into account the amount of our national income. We must remember that it is impossible to take a quart out of a pint pot, though some persons evidently seem anxious to make the a ttempt. Meanwhile the immediate task before Parliament is to balance the budget as was promised by the Prime Minister in July, and in accordance with the undertaking entered into by him with the Premiers of the States in August last. This revised budget falls very far short of Some achieving that desirable end. Those honourable members who are concerned about the future of their country are profoundly disappointed with the Government's financial proposals. To budget deliberately for a deficit of anything from £1,000,000 to £S,000,000 merely because the Government is afraid to make those economies which it knows should be made is not the way to restore our national credit. Such action must injure our credit, which is low enough as it is. What is the position in New Zealand? We have heard in the past a great deal about our enormous national debt, and that Australia is carrying a tremendous load of debt per head of population-Stat e and Commonwealth. It is indeed a very big debt, but the fact remains that the national debt of New Zealand is greater per head than the national debt of Australia-Stat e and Gommonwealth combined. Yet New Zealand's credit is so good that her 5 per cent, bonds are worth on the London market £102 10s. as compared with £75 for Australian bonds. The credit of South Africa also is thoroughly sound, and her 5 per cent, bonds are worth £100 15s. Our credit would not have fallen so low if the Government had had the courage to face the situation as it should have done. I can speak for the members of my own party, and, I think, for every honourable member on this side of the House, when I say that had. the Government brought down proposals to economise sufficiently to balance the budget it would have had the unqualified support of every member on this side of the House. The Government should have taken steps . to honour the two pledges to which I have referred. Those promises were made not by us but by the Government, yet we would be prepared to support the Government in auy measures of economy designed to carry them out. Evidently, the Government is prepared to break its own word in this matter, because it lacks the courage to do what it knows ought to be done. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. ,",27
52,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"Warringah) [5.15] - I should have thought that in a debate of this kind when, one might say, the fate of the country is hanging in the balance, at least some orahle members on the Government side of the House would have risen in their places to defend the Government's financial proposals. I should have thought that there would, perhaps, be some honourable members on the opposite side who would have ranged themselves behind the pledges given by the Prime Minister in July last, and the undertaking. entered into by him in August with the Premiers of the various States. I had looked for some pronouncement from them which would have had the effect of maintaining and supporting our national credit, without which we can achieve nothing in the present crisis. Evidently, however, the statement of the Acting Treasurer is to go unsupported, and no reply is to he made to the devastating criticism levelled against the budget by the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. In the course of a clear, forceful and analytical speech, the Leader of the Opposition exposed the hollow hypocrisy of ' the Government's proposals, and pointed out how far those proposals fell short of what our national honour demanded should be done.",33
53,Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Norman. Makin) - It is not proper for the honourable member to suggest that anything dishonourable has been done.,33
54,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"Of course I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker, However, I shall say it outside.",33
55,Mr SPEAKER ,"The honourable member will not be in order in saying it here. Mr ARCHDAL E PARKHILL The platforms of this country will ring with the statements I have just made regarding the inadequacy of these proposals to meet"" the situation. Everyone now admits its seriousness. If the Government had brought down proposals in accordance with the terms of the Melbourne agreement-that agreement which was signed by the Prime Minister him- ' self after he had conferred with his cabinet-w e on this side of the House would have done our utmost to assist it. While I am prepared, even now, to support the Government in any reasonable proposals, I shall not remain silent when I see it perpetrating cruel injustices on sections of my fellow citizens. I blame the Government for not having the courage to cope with the situation hon- in its early stages. The gravest doubts were expressed as to the wisdom of the departure of the Prime Minister ( Mr. Scullin) for England at such a critical period. However, the right honourable gentleman signed an undertaking that certain action should be taken by the Government, and nothing can convince me that ii was not the bounden duty of the Government to place those proposals before this House promptly. Instead, it vacillated and allowed the position to become more acute. It was only after the result of the New South Wales elections had been announced and the problem had become alarmingly dangerous and difficult, rhat Parliament was called together. As far back as last August, Cabinet agreed that certain action should be taken, but it was as late as the 3rd October last before the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr. Penton) stated- The Cabinet has met and discussed the ""-hole financial position. Proposals to the budget, submitted by the sub-committee of the Cabinet, were discussed and were approved substantially as presented. It was agreed that the expenditure must be reduced at the rate of approximately £4,000,000 a year. He asserted that the party would meet on Monday, the 27th October, and that Parliament would be called together on Thursday, the 30th October. announcement is definite. agreed to reduce the budget by £4,000,000 per annum. Now, after all that delay, the Government comes down with a proposed reduction which is, comparatively, a mere bagatelle. It is apparent from the financial statement of the Acting Treasurer ( Mr. Lyons) that the honourable gentleman did his utmost to pursuade the Government to agree to a more satisfactory and effective arrangement. A close examination of his speech makes it obvious that, while it embodies the Acting Treasurer's desires to a certain point, the pruning knife has been used severely, and party interpolations are numerous. I give the Acting Treasurer all credit for his endeavour to give effect to the honourable intentions of his leader, and realise that his endeavours have been checked by the' party. Certainly, the proposals advanced fall deplorably short of what is necessary. Three different opinions are advanced by different sections in this chamber. There are those who believe that the position can be righted only by strict economy, the payment of our debts, and a reduction in the cost of production. Another section apparently wants us co pay our way, but at the same time desires to maintain our fictitious rates of wag^s and standard of living, without advancing any definite plans to enable that to be done. Like all weak people, adherents of that section are floundering in the morass of political expediency and moral cowardice. In that category I place the Government. Then there is a third section, composed of members who are prepared to repudiate the nation's debts rather than reduce wages or extend hours of labour,, believing that therein lies their easiest political path. I believe, definitely, that the salvation of Australia lies only in the adoption of the first method. By resorting to the inflation of currency, under the guise of "" stabilization,"" "" extension of credit,"" or any other fanciful name, we balance should merely impose upon our people hardships similar to those placed on their workers by the central powers of Europe. And the result would be the same. Despite the poverty and misery inflicted upon those unfortunate, people, their go- vernments eventually have had to return to the only sane course, that which we on That this side advocated at the last election, Cabinet and advocate now, the first of the three proposals that I have enunciated. Only by such methods can we conform to honourable principles, and lift Australia out of the slough of financial despondency into which it has temporarily fallen.",33
56,Mr A GREEN ,B y lowering wages?,34
57,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA Actually, it would not lower real wages. It is possible to increase the currency and give our workers wages nominally twice as high as those at present paid, but these would not purchase half as much as do existing wages. I do desire, not the reduction of real wages, but a re-adjustment of the position to provide that everybody shall make an equal sacrifice in the effort to stabilize the country. The second method t.o which I have referred is a weak and cowardly way of dealing with the difficulty, while the third course is utterly dishonest, and unworthy of a responsible government. It is just as dishonest for a nation to refuse to pay its just debts as it is for an individual to do so. Any nation that is prepared to resort to subterfuge in an endeavour to evade its liabilities, by issuing valueless paper money, and similar efforts to undermine the national stability, must inevitably reap the financial whirlwind that has been the reward of other nations which have adopted such methods. This Government has failed utterly to eifect the economies which it promised in August last, when it entered into an agreement with the States. It then made a distinct compact with the Labour Premiers of Victoria and South Australia, and the National Premiers of the other States. All were to live within their revenues and endeavour to balance their budgets. To give effect to that undertaking it was necessary to act in a manner which is disagreeable to any politician. No cabinet, either National or Labour, likes to reduce the wages of its civil servants, or to impose grinding taxation upo.n the people. However, the Premiers returned to their respective States perfectly trustful of the good faith of the Commonwealth. They honoured their undertakings, and performed their disagreeable tasks.",34
58,Mr MORGAN ,"And the Commonwealth Government "" squibbed "".",35
59,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"will That is what it amounts to. This Labour Government is the only one of the seven which entered into the agreement which has failed to honour its undertakings, not only with regard to economy but also with regard to taxation.",35
60,Mr A GREEN ,"Such action is quite in accordance with the National policy, but it is pretty hard for a. Labour Government to carry out.",35
61,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA The honourable gentleman - is trying to be nasty, and at the same time justify the supine attitude of his Government. He is not prepared to stand up like a man and make a speech to defend that attitude. The most effective defence that his Government can put forward is the feeble excuse that the task is not a pleasant one. Was it pleasant for Mr. Hogan or Mr Hill, the Labour Premiers of Victoria and South Australia? Could anything be more contemptible and more pitiable than that excuse, offered in extenuation of the inaction of the Commonwealth Labour Government at a time when Australia is passing through the most critical period in its history?",35
62,Mr NAIRN ,"They are a pack of popularity hounds, that's all.",35
63,Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Norman Makin). - Order ! I require the honourable member for Perth ( Mr Nairn) to withdraw that remark.,35
64,Mr NAIRN ,I withdraw it.,35
65,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA When addressing the Loan Council last June, the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Dalley ( Mr Theodore), statedTlie Treasurers feel, however, in view of the difficult outlook generally, that it is proper und advisable for them to urge upon-all Governments the need for the utmost economy with regard to expenditure, also that it is essential for the budgets of the Commonwealth and the States to be balanced for the forthcoming limmcial year. Neither of those essential things is being done by this Government. Speaking at, the Royal Agricultural Show luncheon on the 17th April of this year, the honourable gentleman, who was then'Treasurer, said Australia is heading for bankruptcy. There be a diminution"" of £30,000,000 in Commonwealth revenue, and £50,000,000 less to spend. The facts are so obvious that whether we like it : o r not, we shall be compelled to resort to economy; economy by governments and economies by communities as well. He went on to say, and honourable members will be amused when they hear the quotation furtherI am confident. people will give full credit to the Government that faces the position honestly. It cannot be said that this Government has faced the position honestly, nnd no credit can be given to it. Its present proposals are of no practical use in meeting the situation. When the first budget was introduced earlier this year, the Opposition proposed reductions in expenditure totalling about £4,000,000. I remember advocating, among other things, that the proposed vote of £1,000,000 for unemployment relief should not be expended, because the responsibility for dealing with unemployment rested with the States. The supporters of the Government howled at me at that time for even suggesting that this money should not be made available to relieve the sufferings of the community. It was said that it was imperative that the money should be voted so that relief works could be put in hand. But what, has been done with that money? No less than £850,000 of it-all - that was available-ha s been paid' to South Australia to relieve its impecuniosity. The statements of honourable members opposite that it was imperative that this money should be made available for relief works for the unemployed have been proved to be gross hypocrisy.",35
66,Mr FRANCIS ,Tb e money has been used to help in paying South Australia's interest bill.,36
67,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"That is so. I suppose that it has been used to assist in meeting the cost of the new Adelaide railway station, or something of that kind. At any rate, the unemployed have not received the slightest benefit from it. The total reductions in expenditure that the Government has been able to achieve amount to £1,230,000; but against these reductions there have been increases totalling £S00,000-£400,00 0 in additional pension payments, and £400,000 in increased exchange charges. The net result of all the Government's economies has been a reduction in expenditure of a paltry £430,000 in a total expenditure of £65,587,770. In the circumstances I consider that I am justified in saying that the Government has made no serious - effort to reduce its expenditure. That must be the opinion of any one who looks at the situation without prejudice or party bias. I propose to deal in detail with some of the proposals of the Government. It is intended to effect a reduction the salaries of Ministers and members. The Government has been forced by considerations of simple honesty to bring forward this proposition, but it is seeking to bring about this reduction by a mere subterfuge. The reduction is to be made in the form of taxation at the time of the payment of the salaries. It is being done in this way in order to make it easy to return to the original remuneration at the earliest possible moment. The general public can see through this artifice. It is petty meannesses of this kind that bring honourable members of this and other Parliaments into disrepute.",36
68,Mr A GREEN ,That is not so.,36
69,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"In said my opinion it is so. If the Government had come forward boldly and proposed reasonable. a straight out reduction of members'"" salaries to £500, or if it had even proposed a straight out reduction by 10 per cent, something could have been said for the proposal, but to effect a reduction by means of taxation of the kind suggested is petty and mean. No doubt, the first opportunity will be taken to restore the remuneration of members to £1,000. Honourable members opposite will greedily revert to that figure on the first favourable occasion. I repeat that such conduct brings upon membership of this Parliament, public opprobrium. It is proposed to reduce the salaries of certain public servants, but no salaries affected by the Government's proposal are to be reduced below £725. The Leader of the Opposition has already dealt clearly and penetratingly with this proposal, and has shown the sham and hollowness of it. Out of 40,000.Commonwealth public servants, only 440, including members of Parliament, are to be taxed. Nothing more grotesque could be imagined than this proposal for meeting the difficult financial situation which faces the Government. I am confident that, with few exceptions, all the members of the Cominonwoalth Public Service would be willing to submit to a graduated reduction of their salaries in these difficult times. They feel, as a inatter of fact, that they are being put in a false position by the Government's proposal to tax only the higher salaries, and they would be quite willing to agree to reductions similar to in those which are being imposed upon State public servants. If the Government would introduce a properly graduated tax or salary reduction to apply to the Public Service generally, it would be able to save, not a mere £60,000, but probably £1,000,000 out of the £11,000,000 paid annually to the Public Service. The present proposal must inevitably bring the Government into contumely.",36
70,Mr CROUCH,Would the honourable member tax every public servant?,36
71,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"I am not required to answer the questions of the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch), but I have already that I consider a graduated reduction on a general basis to be fair and The Government's proposals in regard to payments to sinking funds are un*satisfactory and unworthy. They amount, in a measure at least, to a repudiation of the terms upon which money has been borrowed both at home and abroad. If the honourable member for Corangamite had loaned money privately on certain securities, he would not at a later stage be prepared to hand back the securities on the promise of the borrower to provide securities not quite so good as those originally given. Although the honourable member would not do that in his private dealings, he is quite prepared to do it in his public operations. NA",36
72,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,NA r That is to the honourable member's credit.,37
73,Mr CROUCH ,The cases referred to by the honourable member for Warringah are not parallel.,37
74,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"I thought the honourable member would get out of it in some way. If the Bruce Page Government had adopted the methods that this Government is resorting to in order to balance the public accounts, it could easily have finished each financial year with a surplus. But it would not descend to using reparation payments for current purposes as this Government has already done, and it certainly would not have dreamt of defaulting in sinking fund payments ae this Government is now proposing to do. The raiding of the sinking funds by the Bruce-Page Government would have been severely criticized by the members of the Labour party, who were then in Opposition ; yet some of those same honourable members now seem to think that such a practice is quite right. I have said on other occasions in this House, though it was not popular to do so, that our expenditure under the federal aid roads scheme should, in present circumstances, be greatly reduced. I know that some honourable members of the Opposition, who represent country electorates, disagree with my views on this subject, They regard expenditure on main roads as essential in the interests of the primary producers. Generally I do not disagree with this view, and equally desire to see good roads in the country. Yet if in my own garden I could not afford ironite paths I should have to be satisfied with something less costly, and, similarly, I consider that as we cannot afford to lay down expensive concrete highways, which are used in competition with Our railways, we should he content to put down less expensive roads, for the time being at any rate. An amount was provided in the first budget for the repatriation of excess coalminers. This money has not yet been speut, and I do not think that any hardship would be done to any one if the spending of it were deferred for a considerable time, if not altogether. 1I have referred previously to the extended holiday which the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Coleman) is enjoying at the expense of this country. His absence from Australia for such a protracted period is neither more nor less than a public scandal, which the Government should not have allowed to occur. It is said that he did good work at the meetings of the League of Nations, but according to the reports of those meetings he was unable to answer many of the questions put to him. It would appear that the honourable member proved himself to he quite incompetent for the work required of him. A Minister acquainted with the administration of the territories, and able to answer any questions that might be put to him, should have attended the meetings of the League. One report of the League meetings statesMr Coleman was subjected to considerable questioning in regard to matters concerning the administrative service in the territory. At the request of Lord Lugard (Britain), he said that he would have included in the next report particulars of the numbers and rate of pay of each grade of officers so as to distinguish the administrative staff from the technical staff. Replying to another question by Lord Lugard, Mr Coleman said ""he could not give any details as to the nature of the proposed scheme, without reference to his Prime Minister."" Lord Lugard also asked whether Mr Coleman was satisfied royalty was sufficiently high to meet the expenditure on the goldfields."" Mr Coleman said he was not in a position to indicate what the future lines of 'government policy might be.",37
75,Mr A GREEN ,"If the honourable member had a full - report of the meetings of the League, he would see that the honourable member for Eeid ( Mr Coleman) made a. most informative speech.",38
76,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA No man should be sent to the meetings of the League unless he has a full knowledge of the subjects to be dealt with, and is able to satisfy the representatives of other nations that Australia is properly administering the territories over which she has a mandate. Obviously, the Tumor* able member for Eeid could not give those assurances, and, therefore, apart from the question of cost, his representation of Australia can only be regarded as unsatisfactory.",38
77,Mr THOMPSON ,He has had great holiday.,38
78,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA At the request of the Government, the honourable member for Eeid-*-a man without administrative experience-invest ^ gated the administration of Australia House. The publicity which has been given to his investigation is belittling to. the prestige of the Australian High Commissioner. If I , a private member of this House, attempted to investigate the affairs of the Amalgamated Engineering Union of which you, Mr Speaker, are a member, they would properly resent my intrusion. Yet a private member of this House has been sent abroad to inquire into routine matters and details of administration of the office conducted hy the High Commissioner, who is Aus* tralia's representative at the heart of the Empire.",38
79,Dr MALONEY ,^He was man enough to say that he was not competent for the job.,38
80,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA lie realized his limitations; but, apparently, the Government did not. [ should not have objected had the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr. Fenton), when in London, undertaken an investigation of the administration of Australia House.",38
81,Mr A GREEN ,Mr Coleman has done his work well.,38
82,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA Since the present Government came into office twelve months ago, four of its Ministers have been abroad. iiistiuife I have yet to learn whnt good has resulted from the visit of the Acting Prime Minister to England and America.",38
83,Mr ANSTEY ,"The honourable member agreed to his going, - and cheered him of! his departure.",38
84,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"I should also like to know what the Minister for Markets - and Transport ( Mr. Parker Moloney) is, doing in England besides inspecting Australian goods at Harrod's and Selfridge's.",38
85,Mr A GREEN ,"The - honourable member, said that he had no objection to Ministers going abroad.",38
86,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"NA Then there is the Attorney-General ( Mr, Brennan) who, beyond making a speech at the meeting of the League of Nations, a has done very little since he left Australia. Why does he not come home? His brilliant qualities should b'e . at the disposal of the Government in Australia in these critical times.",38
87,Mr ANSTEY ,Member s of the Opposition unanimously agreed that the Attorney-General should go abroad.,38
88,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,. 1 did not say so. I aim now 'exercising my right to protest against his long absence from Australia. Mr C. RILEY - The honourable member attacks the Attorney-General behind his back.,38
89,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"I am not attacking the Attorney-General behind his back; as a public man I am entitle'd to voice my protest against his absence from Australia at this time. Having carried out the work which he was appointed to do at the Assembly of the League of Nations, the Attorney General should have returned to Australia instead bf careering round the countryside of England at a time when Australia can ill-afford the expenditure that is being incurred. Before leaving Australia the Prime Minister said that he would not return empty-handed; but so far there is little evidence pf his having achieved anything worthwhile. All he seems to have accomplished is to have gained the sympathy of the people of England because of the actions of his colleagues in his absence. The Government's attempts at For economy are a byword. It has hot ma'de an honest attempt to reduce expenditure: it has uot been untrammelled by political considerations, otherwise ir could bave saved at least £4,000,000. A study of the Government's taxation proposals suggests that it has sought the most cruel form of taxation to impose on the workers of Australia. In one year it expects to take £44,000,000 out of the pockets of a little over 6,000,000 people by means of customs duties. It has also imposed a tax on tea. I can imagine with what joy the announcement of this tax was received by many persons in the community. I fancy that I can hear the applause of the workers in Brunswick and other industrial centres of the Commonwealth, when Labour members tell their constituents that, in addition to taxing their beer and tobacco, the Government, has imposed a tax of 4d. or 6d. per lb. on the family tea. The sales tax has also been increased as a means of getting the country out of its financial difficulties. The presence in the chamber of the honourable member for South Sydney ( Mr E. Riley) reminds me of a sxieech he made in the recent election campaign in New South Wales, in which he told the electors that the Federal Government would have the courage to increase the sales tax. He did not tell them that that tax was directed at those at the base of the pyramid-the workers-while the more wealthy sections of the community, at the apex of the pyramid, would be unaffected by it. Nor did. he tell the electors that the Government which had the courage to increase the sales tax was not game to reduce the allowances of members of Parliament. A few weeks ago the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley), speaking ou the solidarity of the Labour caucus, said that nothing in the civilized world is equal to this expression of human endeavour which is so solid and united. Yet within a week that magnificent structure which he called upon every one to admire, was tottering on its foundations. hear of divisions with twenty ayes and sixteen noes. The whole of this morning was spent by the caucus in watering down a previous motion to make it so innocuous that no one can understand it. The Government's taxation proposals will hit the worker hardest of all, and will vent the downward trend in the cost of living. The taxation imposed by this Mr Archdale Parkhill. Government is so heavy that I do not know how the workers outside those in the sheltered industries will he able to carry on. One of the undertakings given by the Commonwealth Government at the Melbourne conference was that the Commpnwealth would not further encroach on. the field of taxation which rightly belonged to the States. Thu Acting Treasurer's ( Mr Lyons) financial statement included this paragraphTin; now income tax proposals relate principally to income from property. The object aimed at is an increase in property taxation, which, with increases by the States, w i ll result in property bearing a fair burden in the pJau of budget re-adjustment. Clearly, this amended budget is an infraction of the Melbourne undertaking; it proposes a shattering inroad on the States' domain of taxation. The honourable gentleman further stated that the new proposals "" are designed so as to spread the aftditional burdens equitably over the whole community without unduly eutering the fields of taxation on which the States rely "". Are we to infer that in addition to the imposts which this Government now threatons, the States also are to increase their income taxes? If that happens, the country will he in a. desperate state. Already the Government has found that the last increases of duties on beer and spirits have reduced instead of increasing the revenue, and they cannot proceed further in that field without risking an undue sacrifice of income. That is true also of tobacco and other heavily taxed commodities. The limit of taxation has been reached, and it is time that the Government realized that Australia cannot be taxed into prosperity. I have never heard of a more unfair proposal than that relating to the tax on income from property. The Government proposes to raise an additional £1,500 000 from income tax, the bulk of which will come from the most deserving class in We the community-the thrifty people of small incomes. The exemption of income from property is to be reduced from £3CO to £100, and will disappear entirely when the taxable income reaches £200. Cn such income, the Government proposes to levy a further tax of 1 \ per cent. Th.U premeans that the small property-owner, who by industry, rigid thrift, and stern selfdenial, has saved a few thousand pounds, w hile his neighbour has been punting his money away ou the racecourse and wasting it on pianolas and motor cars, is, in lu's old age, to be taxed into penury. The Acting Treasurer hypocritically All fixed income from property, including interest, is in a relatively better position day than last year hecuusc of reduced commodity prices. In these circumstances, income from property may fairly be required to provide more taxation. Is that not true also of public servants in receipt of salaries of less than £725 per annum, and of unionists in sheltered industries who.se wages are at the peak, while their fellow unionists are struggling for a crust? The Government's proposal will mean that a widow, who has an income of £200 from bonds and property, will be required to pay as much inco'i'; tax as a man in receipt of a salary of £750.",38
90,Dr MALONEY ,It is not just.,40
91,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"It is not, and the Labour party should not sr.and for such inequality. A person with an annual income of £300 from property will pay £29 8s. 4d., whilst a man with a salary of £1,000 a year will pay only £34 10s. 3d. Such inequalities cannot be justified. Many people with a small income from investments have little or no margin above the amount sufficient to maintain them; they are too proud to lean on the State, but because they have won a bare competence an additional 12s. 6d. per week is to be extorted from rhem. What encouragement is there for people to provide for their old age instead of relying on pensions and other forms of eleemosynary aid ? It is little wonder that the number of applicants for the old age pension is increasing and that it3 annual cost to the country is mounting steadily. I protest emphatically against this injustice to a most deserving class. People have been advised to inculcate into the minds of their families the principles of thrift and independence. The Commonwealth Bank employs a most talented woman, Miss Janet Mitchell, to lecture on thrift and encourage people to make provision for their old age. Its banking chambers are placarded ""Buy a bond; look after your old age"". When people act on that precept instead'of leaning on the Government, they are threatened with punitive taxation. The thrifty folk, who mostly comprise the middle classes, are the best assets to the nation. The wealthy people can look after their own interests; I hold no brief for them, although I believe they are entitled to justice, and I shall see that they get it. I have no conto- cern for the waster who will not work, otherwise than finding him work to do, but I am concerned with the thrifty class who are being deliberately plundered by the present Government. This penal taxation is wrong. Over 80 per cent, of the workers are dependent upon private employers. How is employment to expand under constantly increasing taxation ? If by taxation the Government takes all profits out of industry, how are the unemployed to be absorbed? This taxation system is economically unsound and unstatesmaiilike, anct it arises from the failure of the Government to shoulder the responsibility of reducing the cost of administration. If it had had the courage to reduce expenditure to the point of hurting, the finances would be on a better basis. But with the exception of a few unprotected non-unionists in the Defence Department, nobody is seriously affected or worried by the Government's economy proposals. The truth is that no real economy is being practised. As recently ns the 30th October the Sydney Sun reported that the Prime Minister ( Mr. Scullin) had said, in the course of a radio-telephone conversation with the"" Acting Prime Minister, that the financial position in London was most difficult, and stressed the necessity for adhering to the programme laid down at the Melbourne conference. Because the Government has lacked the courage to do that, and because of its general incapacity to stand up to its job, the Commonwealth is in a serious financial depression, and there is little hope of financial and economic salvation from the present Administration. Sitting suspended from, 6.IS to 8 p.m.",40
92,Mr CURTIN ,"Premantle) [8.0] - On e readily recognizes that the session that has been summoned on this occasion has to deal with about the most important economic problem Australia has yet faced; and I should have, imagined that the Opposition, which has a history to answer for in connection with this problem, would rather have faced the future than - have concentrated as it were the whole of its criticism upon what it alleges to be the sins of omission of the present Government during the last few months. T doubt if political audacity has even been greater than in the case of men, who, in a period of unprecedented difficulty and acute depressionwhen, as they say, the national income has fallen by about £150,000,000, when the prices of our principal staples have been almost cut in half and when the revenues of the Government have been depleted and inevitable expenditure increased-hav e the hardihood to expect an achievement which they themselves failed to accomplish during years of comparative industrial opulence. They failed to balance their budgets when prices were high, when the national income was buoyant, when the industries of. the country were comparatively prosperous and when the great majority of the people were employed. If they have a policy it surely involves putting the past behind them and, instead of holding, inquests on what has been done by others, to look to the future to discover, if possible, means by which the present position may be rectified. We could then engage as a sort of economic council in a dispassionate examination of the question. But the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) this afternoon, far from suggesting anything towards elucidating the problem or discovering solutions for it, was rather directed towards converting the community towards the political standard which he himself holds up. It was a speech delivered, as I beard it, with a view to vote-winning rather than to problem-solving. There can be no question that the whole of the utterances of representative leaders of the party opposite during the last, few weeks have been directed very largely towards endeavouring to throw the whole onus of the present situation on the present Government and its supporters, rather than io presenting the facts in their entirety so. that the public might realise clearly that this problem is not innate to Australia, but is one that has arisen because, shall I say, of the financial bankSfr.

There is not a country in the world irrespective of whether it can or cannot for the moment obtain budget equilibrium that is not faced with economic difficulties almost identical with those confronting the people of Australia.",40
93,Mr GREGORY ,That is not so.,41
94,Mr CURTIN ,"It is. Whether a country has one policy or another, in the major sense the mass of its people are suffering because of the impossibility of marketing their products profitably. That applies to the United States of America equally wijh Great Britain, and to Germany equally with Belgium, and it applies to Australia. Our difficulties are due not to auy physical impairment of our productive apparatus; they have not arisen because of any slothfulness on the part of our people. Indeed, almost parodoxically it may be said that at no other time in the history of this continent has the production of the soil been so bountiful as it is at the present moment; yet it remains a tragic commentary upon tlm situation that this abundance of nature which has been fructified by man's industry aud genius has contributed nothing towards the solution of our difficulties.",41
95,Dr MALONEY ,'And people are starving.,41
96,Mr CURTIN ,"In the midst of plenty, there are, as the honourable member says, many people who are starving. There are two groups of problems. There is the problem of Governmental finance, the problem of managing the affairs of the nation as a sort of national executive, and there is deeper than that, and largely responsible for it, the problem of the effective and profitable employment of the resources of the people. It is my judgment for what it is worth that there can be no budgetary equilibrium in Australia, either for the Commonwealth or the States, so long as 200,000 of our people are out of work and our industries :ir<incapable of carrying on effectively.",41
97,Mr NAIRN ,What is the remedy?,41
98,Mr GREGORY ,To take more money from the people.,41
99,Mr CURTIN ,"That is a rather cheap kind of sneer, because if honourable members challenge me on the point, I shall cite chapter and verse for the extraordinary increases in revenue which the previous Government extracted from the people of this country; I shall point out that, whether through indirect or direct taxation, our predecessors inherited a ceri.ain revenue, and till they did each year was to innate it and meet every problem' either by not paying their way or by exr-ructing more revenue from the people and industries of this continent. Honourable members need not challenge me on i.lie point; the testimony is there for whoever likes to look at it. The last two budgets presented by the Nationalist Government showed deficits, so that the dishonour, which it is said by the Opposition to attach to this party because of its inability to meet the expenditure out of revenue, is one that attaches to themselves. If to fail to pay one's way each year is a cardinal offence against national honour the Labour party is not the initiators of this chapter of obloquy in the national history. It has been written by othera in ci rcjumstances less justifiable than the present. The Leader of the Opposition in bis amendment suggests that all would be right if we were to adopt and carry into legislative, effect the programme considered by the Premiers in August, last at a conference at which Sir Otto Niemeyer was present. I have some figures showing the result of the first four months, operations of the States and the Commonwealth, and the deficits of the Commonwealth and the States at the end of October. If it be a tribute to certain Premiers that they have agreed on paper to the establishment of budgetary equilibrium for their States we are entitled to ask how far the performance squares with the declaration of intent. At the end of the first four months' operations of the present financial year the States showed the following deficits:-Wester n Australia, £748,000; Victoria, £3,781,384; New South Wales, £5,306,280; Tasmania, ' £210,474; South Australia, £1,495,293; Queensland, £674,248. These States which, according to the Leader of the Opposition, definitely undertook to balance their budgets, these States, which are setting, so we are told, an example that the Federal Government should follow-whic h are doing the unpleasant things referred to by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkbill) and whose conduct is said to be something that shines out as a bright light in contradistinction to the manner in which the Commonwealth Government is behaving-hav e as a result of the first four montlis' operations of the current financial year shown an aggregate deficit of £12.215,679. Mr G'KEOOUY - What is tht Commonwealth's deficit ' 1",41
100,Mr CURTIN ,"It . is £5,900,000 on four months' operations. I ask honourable members to put the question fairiy to themselves-in what respect is the August agreement, which apparently has become a sort of Ten Commandments for the Governments of Australia, being observed hy the States? They are in the cleft, stick of financial, embarrassment just the same as the Commonwealth. They find that, however well intentioned may have been their promises, every step they take along the road of the Niemeyer plan makes it increasingly difficult for them to realise their financial expectations. Every reduction in wages, every rationing in employment, every diminution in the purchasing power of the community, reacts upon the taxpaying capacity, and as a result the revenues which have been forecast b3 the Treasurers, r Commonwealth or State, have not been, and will not be. realized. All the talk that there was a sort of sacred covenant entered into in Melbourne last August, and which this Government is the one ignoble administration in Australia to dishonor, falls absolutely to the ground in the face of the reality. The reality is that, whatever be their, intentions or their readiness t,o subscribe to the conception of budgetary adjustment, the facts have not permitted the Treasurers' budgets to be adjusted. While it may be argued in a most sophistical way that the first two or tln-pe months of the financial year are always the worse, that the income tax assess-^ ments have not been issued, and that there is a piling up of arrears from the previous year as a result of certain hookkeeping arrangements, the first three months of this year in comparison with the first three months of any previous year prove to be by far the worse from the stand-point of budget equation.; and I say, quite frankly, that I see no expectation of the finances of the Commonwealth or the States being adjusted on an even keel in the next twelve months. The problem that confronts us has taken years to grow. From 1914 Australian governmental finance has been complicated and embarrassed by. the tremendous piling up of interest charges. Of the taxation estimated to be collected this year by the Federal and State Governments, 62 per cent, will be paid in interest, and sinking fund charges. Ouo of every pound which Railways Commissioners of Commonwealth and the States collect in rates and fares, 7s. is paid in interest and sinking fund charges. While this terrific incursion into the ordinary revenue of the natioif is made for the purpose of satisfying the claims of bondholders, how can it be expected that any industrial enterprise will pay? And if industrial enterprises cannot pay-and what is true of the railways is true of almost every other industrial and productive enterprise in the nation-ho w in the name of common sense is it to be expected that the nation, which is merely a reflection in a corporate sense of the individual life of the people, can have its finances adjusted upou an even keel? It is true thut honourable members opposite have a policy. That policy nakedly and unashamedly stated by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr. Parkhill), in so far as it affects the public Bervants, is that he would reduce their salaries by a graduated cut. He would reduce every one. That remedy, although not likely to contribute towards the rejuvenation of Australia's economic life, might certainly contribute towards a bookkeeping adjustment of national finances, and might permit of 70 per cent, instead of a 62 per cent, share to bond-holders. I do not say that the great financial interests of Australia would not cheerfully endorse and even welcome such a policy. But I put this question to this House and to the country: Are all the problems of nations to be solved by the operation of a policy of Mr Curtin. depressing .the wages of those who ore the poorest of this and every other community."" . , -- . We were told in the course of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) that there are those in this community who, apparently, meeting in a corner of this building, are recreant, not ouly to their trusteeship as representatives of the people, but also to any conception of national decency, that they would repudiate the obligations of this country in a variety of ways, and that because of their overt acts which, apparently, commenced only this week, it has become impossible to rectify Australia's over the seas financial position. The truth of this the inatter goes back far beyond any particular meeting held in Canberra this week. The attack upon Australian securities commenced a year ago. The onslaught upon the credit of this country did not originate with any decisions that may or may not have been made in the Labour caucus, and, after all, international finance is concerned, not with opinions, but with facts. With respect to opinions, I suppose that few persons have any great admiration for the political stability of the South American republics. Their policies apparently would not be endorsed by the right-thinking, and, shall we say, influential, statesmen of Europe, hut that does not prevent South America from being a f r u it f u l field of investment for international capital. It does not prevent the Argentine railways from being built out of funds secured in Europe and for the most part floated on the London stock market. Whatever may be the opinions of Englishmen regarding the politics of the South American Republics, the fact remains that so long as those countries are a profitable field of investment, money is poured into them from nil over the world.",42
101,Mr MORGAN ,The Argentine has (me of the most conservative governments in the world.,43
102,Mr CURTIN ,"There are conservative governments everywhere. One of the most conservative is the present Federal Government. In any event the problems of this country are definitely related to the world problem, which, in essence, is that productive power on the part of the peoples of the world has i greatly outstripped the means of exchange; in other words, the available for the exchange of goods and services are inadequate when measured on piece-work. by the tremendous mass of goods and services that have to be exchanged. need not cite evidence in support of that reduced. contention. I simply remind this House that in 1914 when the great war comable menced there was withdrawn f fields of production in Great B ritain and other countries not thousands but millions of men who had previously been engaged in the performance of the industrial vices of civilization. These men went forth to war. They were engaged in 101 forms of activity, which, from the standable point of production, could be said to be entirely useless. These men were conmy quotation. sumers instead of producers of goods. They left behind them, as it were, a residuum of labourers who, by reason the stimulus given to production by the necessities of war, were able so to augment the productive efficiency of mankind .as to make food, clothf ing and other commodities availmembers able to civilization, if not upon the same standard as before the war, upon a livin g standard. In addition all the requirements of war were this diminished army of labourers. When the war ended and this enormous army . of men attempted to - return to the fields and to the workshops, they found that they had to a large extent been supplanted by junior labour and young women who had been trained in industrial vocations. Their services were not required and there was no place for them as labourers. Then the doctrine was sounded, and its echoes reverberated through this chamber this afternoon that the remedy for unemployment was that everybody should take less, that we should take a retrograde step and bring about a lower standard by asking the workers to work longer hours for less pay.",43
103,Mr LAZZARINI ,"Produc e more and take less. Mr. Curtin"" - That is what it amounts to. That is no remedy for unemwith ployment. In fact the remedy is really the opposite direction. Mr . in his book, My L if e and Work, said that f it ever came to a test whether dividends should be paid or wages lowered, he would facilities abolish dividends.",44
104,Mr WHITE ,H is employees were paid,44
105,Mr CURTIN ,Mr Ford did not I even suggest that wages should be,44
106,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,The honormember is quoting only one section r o m the of what Mr Ford said.,44
107,Mr CURTIN ,"The honourable member is himself an adept at picking out particular allusions to reinforce his arguserments. I submit that in quoting Mr . Ford, I have not misrepresented his general conclusions and u n t i l the honor' member for Warringah can show that I have, he has no right to challenge I now come to a consideration of the of position of Australia. First of all the existing depression has been brought about mainly because the enormous in* pouring of loan funds into this country r o m overseas has ceased. Honourable opposite have lived on overseas loans during the whole period of their at least political existence.",44
108,Mr GULLETT ,What of the State provided by Labour Governments?,44
109,Mr CURTIN ,"I am dealing with the Commonwealth as a whole and not with individual States. Furthermore, were it not for the fact that these loans were regularly available to meet Australia's overseas obligations, this financial crisis which now faces Australia would have developed years before. It has emerged for three reasons. It is not unassociated with the political changes that have taken place in Australia. There are tliose overseas who detest and fear the advent of Labour Governments in Australia.",44
110,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,They have every reason to fear Labour - Governments.,44
111,Mr CURTIN ,"They fear them because they know that Labour Governments are concerned more with the well-being of the people of this country than the appreciation of the fixed in in comes of those who have invested in goHenry Eord, vernment, securities. NA",44
112,Mr MAXWELL ,That means repudiation.,45
113,Mr GULLETT ,Pu t it in plain English.,45
114,Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Norman Makin) --Order !,45
115,Mr CURTIN ,"It is no use honourable members on that side dodging issues that are bound to be raised throughout the country. I say frankly that I do not regard the claims of bond-holders, either inside or outside of Australia, as superior to those of the men and women who are engaged in the industries and productive enterprises of this country.",45
116,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Are their claims equal?,45
117,Mr CURTIN ,"The honourable member can reason that out for himself. Every step that has been taken in recent years, more"" particularly since the partial revival of the gold standard in Europe, has had as its effect, if not its purpose, the appreciation of the value of the stock held by bond-holders in Australia.",45
118,Mr FRANCIS ,The value of stocks has fallen.,45
119,Mr CURTIN ,That is not so. It is pointed out that every fall in prices has the effect of increasing the purchasing power of the incomes of those who have titles to the public debt.,45
120,Mr LATHAM ,And of all persons on fixed payments.,45
121,Mr CURTIN ,"That may be so, but Mr SPEAKER - Order ! the number of those in receipt of fixed wage payments in Australia is not very large.",45
122,Mr LATHAM ,It includes the Comwas monwealth public servants.,45
123,Mr CURTIN ,"If we are to arrive at right conclusions, it is necessary to keep distinct the valuation to be placed income derived from property or investgovernmental ments as against that to be placed on income derived from personal exertion. I say, definitely, that in respect of policy of taxation that is submitted to this House I shall always endeavour to ensure that its incidence falls most heavily upon those who derive incomes without personal exertion.",45
124,Mr GULLETT ,It always has.,45
125,Mr CURTIN ,Then what is the honlong orable member growling about?,45
126,Mr GULLETT ,"-Taxatio n is being increased to "" save the skins "" of public servants who belong to unions. Mr. Curtin' - I feel certain that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would pay his intelligence a compliment if he refrained from interjecting for ten minutes. C say candidly that the whole policy, which is rooted in the Niemeyer philosophy, means two things.",45
127,Mr GULLETT ,"It means ""pay our debts "".",45
128,Mr CURTIN ,"-Eve n to keep silent for ten minutes is apparently too great a task for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This policy, as I understand it.. involves, first, a deflation of all incomes in Australia, except those derived from investments in government stocks. Secondly, it means that because of the fall in prices, and the consequential fall in the national revenue, an increasing proportion of the national revenue must be diverted towards meeting the charges incidental to the national debt.",45
129,Mr LATHAM ,What does the honourable member intend to do about it?,45
130,Mr CURTIN ,"I shall come to that later. Mr J. M . Keynes, in his work, The Economic Reconstruction of Europe. says that there comes a point when the problem of meeting the national debt i? insoluble by orthodox methods.",45
131,Mr GULLETT ,What is the honourable member suggesting?,45
132,Mr CURTIN ,Judgin g by the interjections of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition one would imagine that this an assembly of the honourable ladies of the Australian Women's National League - The essence of the governmental difficulty in Australia today is entirely upon due to the enormous payments from revenues that are necessarily made in meeting our public debt. Mr WHiTE -'-Does that explain the any honourable member's motion in caucus?,45
133,Mr CURTIN ,"It does not. Neither does it. explain the honourable member's presence in this chamber. So long as these enormous demands are made upon the national revenue involving as they do the imposition of tremendous taxation so will it be impossible to have, an economic re-adjustment in Australia. Lord Buckmaster, ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, said on 3rd January of this yearThe war debts are crushing us all. The; should be reviewed with a view to tlieir cancellation. A country can be paid only in gold, goods, or services. No country can be paid in gold. If in services or goods what becomes of 3'our own industries?",45
134,Mr GULLETT ,Is this a repudiation speech ?,46
135,Mr CURTIN ,"No . If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) feels so disposed he can visit Elsternwick next week and take the text of this quotation with him : The Financial News in its issue of 20th October said fditoriallyThe best of economists see clearly the inevitability of a re-arrangement of war and reparation debts. They stand in the way of world recovery and must bulk larger as time passes. They have reached that stage in Great B r it a in. In Australia, irrespective of what the national income is, £55,000,000 has to be employed this year in meeting interest and sinking f u n d charges due by the Commonwealth and the States. It has to be recognized that if our tax income reaches any point below £55,000,000 we must default in our payments to bondholders. If we collect only £55,000,000 in taxation what is to become of the claims of invalid and old-age pensioners, of the widows of soldiers, or the payment of services of government. Obviously if that £55,000,000 is absolutely sacredand I say not one word against its payment",46
136,Mr GULLETT ,"Oh , no!",46
137,Mr CURTIN ,"-Honourable members opposite refer to public servants as members of a sheltered class, but I object to the class of bondholders who are entitled to a minimum income of £55,000,000 each year, taken from the resources of this country, irrespective of the declension in the national income, being regarded as an absolutely sheltered class immune from any responsibility.",46
138,Mr GULLETT ,Who are they?,46
139,Mr CURTIN ,"If it is a question deciding who represents the sheltered class I should 'say it is the bondholders and not the public servants,, who for th« most part are usefully engaged in the cent. ? services of the Commonwealth and whose remuneration is determined by a properly constituted authority.",46
140,Mr GULLETT ,Why does the honourable member not object to Mr Hogan taxing the public servants in Victoria?,46
141,Mr SPEAKER ,"Hon. Norman M a k in ) . I have repeatedly called to order certain honourable members who have been persistently interjecting, and in this respect the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) has been very prominent. I ask honourable members not to offend again, otherwise I shall be compelled to take further action. Honourable members should realise that the debate cannot be carried on satisfactorily if such conduct is permitted.",46
142,Mr CURTIN ,It has been said that the Labour party in essence stands for a gross and deliberate inflation of the note issue as against any proposal to reduce wages-that if given the choice between the two proposals the supporters of the Government favour inflation of the note issue.,46
143,Mr LATHAM ,"Obviously , that is true. Eepudiation is favoured by some honourable members opposite.",46
144,Mr CURTIN ,"Mr E . C. Dyasou, who collaborated with Professors Brigden and Copland and Mr C. H . Wickens in preparing a treatise on the Australian tariff, at the request of the Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member, has saidThe Australian currency stands as the most stable of the currencies in the world in recent .years. He further says, in connection with the process of deflation which is put forward and which in essence is involved absolutely in the process of wage-cutting, that rapid inflation and deflation of the purchasing-power of money are mischievous. He continues The present programme of attempting to increase the purchasing-power of our money by perhaps 30 per cent, (for the ludicrous reason that the Bank of France won't behave itself) is us mischievous, and may be as damaging to the social fabric as the opposite of policy, advocated by the Reds, of wholesale inflation.",46
145,Mr GREGORY ,"What does he say concerning, a reduction of salaries by 10 per",46
146,Mr CURTIN ,"Comin g to certain decisions aud resolutions alleged to have been reached this week, let me point that Mr Dyason saysWe do not realise in Australia that doctrine of greater monetary stability become respectable-that such men as Mr John Maynard Keynes, Sir Josiah Stamp, Professor Cassel and Sir Henry Strakosch regard achievement its the outstanding social necessity. There is uot a word about wage deflation there. He then makes this declaration, to which I subscribe and which I regard as the pivot upon which economic equilibrium in Australia can be established. He says The Board of the Commonwealth Bank can adopt it tomorrow and, probably, cure within a reasonable time (say two years) half, but not the whole of our present ills. The implication in that statement, which I submit for the consideration of honourable members, is, in effect, that the Commonwealth Bank Board has the power to cure within two years one half of the present ills from which the Commonwealth is suffering.",47
147,Mr GULLETT ,No .,47
148,Mr CURTIN ,"Professo r Brigden stated in a speech delivered in Brisbane on the 22nd October that at present an inflation of the note issue is justified. Mr Harold Burston, the financial writer of the Melbourne Herald, remarked last week that under stable conditions a temporary expansion of the note issue would, be justified.",47
149,Mr LATHAM ,Unde r normal conditions it is done every year.,47
150,Mr CURTIN ,What are stable conditions?,47
151,Mr LATHAM ,Norma l conditions.,47
152,Mr CURTIN ,"I am entitled to remind honourable' members opposite that if they had had their way in 1910, 1911 and 1912, just, as they seek to have their way to-night, there would have been no Commonwealth note issue today. remind this Parliament also that if the considered political and financial principles of honourable members opposite have remained static, asd if they are the inheritors of the policy of th? Liberal party, the stand which they - ok in those years would have left the Latiori without the services of a Commonwealth Bank. Thos? honourable members who say that we can cure all our economic difficulties by reducing the expenditure of the out Commonwealth by £4,000,000 do not give any details.",47
153,the ^ Mr LATHAM ,We went fully into has details concerning every penny.,47
154,Mr CURTIN ,The position 1ms its changed considerably since then.,47
155,Mr LATHAM ,Du e to the vacillation of the Government.,47
156,Mr CURTIN ,"Governmenta l expenditure can be reduced in a variety of ways; but the question is whether the system proposed is right and proper. Everybody recognizes that it is a gospel of perfection to reduce governmental expenditure, in Australia. Honourable members opposite would reduce our railways expenditure only hy reducing wages. They would not presume to reduce terest to bondholders. Reduce every one, the national expenditure in every way except by reducing the payments of interest to bondholders. Reduce everyone, they say; but regard the bondholders a? absolutely sacrosanct! Mr .ARCHDALE PARKHILL - Does the honourable member say that they should .not get their money?",47
157,Mr CURTIN ,I am not saying anything about that.,47
158,Mr MAXWELL ,"Shoul d the people of Australia who borrowed these sums from the bondholders, and promised, not only to repay the amount, but also a certain rate of interest during the currency of the loan, honour that promise?",47
159,Mr CURTIN ,"Yes , decidedly. We should honour every obligation. We should honour our obligation to every man and woman in this country, who by virtue of his or her citizenship is entitled to a reasonable subsistence. My reply to the honourable member for Fawkner ( Mr Maxwell) is that if necessity compels a contraction of the public I revenues of this country; if national conditions make it impossible to satisfy all the claims that can properly be lodged against the nation, should those of bondholders be treated on a different basis from those of invalid, + old-age, and soldier pensioners, and men and women entitled to just wages? Do I understand the honourable member to say that it is right to reduce by statute the claims of invalid, old-age, and soldier's pensions and those who have the right to wages? Mr MAXWHI.I. - The honourable member is begging the question. The classes mentioned were all parties to the borrowing of money. They borrowed the money and made certain promises to repay which ought to be honored.",47
160,Mr CURTIN ,"I agree. I put this conception of the case to the honourable NA These persons lent money to the Australian nation at a time when prices were high and when the purchasing power of their investments was at a given figure. Is it suggested that, irrespective of what might happen, these persons are entitled to the ful l speculative value of their investments if they appreciate?",48
161,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,"If wages are fixed when the cost of living is at a certain figure, does the honourable member think that they should remain at that rate when the cost of living is reduced? That'is my answer to the honourable member's question.",48
162,Mr CURTIN ,"The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) this afternoon endeavoured to show that, but for the policy of this party, the magic wand of Nationalism would be waved in the city of London, and that our overseas obligations would be funded. He said, in effect, that so long as there are Labour Governments in Australia, Australian securities in London will be imperilled and subject to attack, and that the only way to keep them at par on the London market is to return him. ""and his colleagues to the ministerial benches. One would imagine that the political opinions of the Australian people are important factors in determining the flow of capital either to or from Australia. I venture to assert that there are two reasons why Australian securities have been attacked overseas. Tho first is that a diagnosis of the last seven years of Australian economic history must suggest to the intelligent observer that the country was undeniably drifting in respect to its economic position. In support of that contention I shall cite a few facts. First, let us bear in mind that for' about six years wo had an excess of imports over exports to the extent of over £70,000,000. Secondly, all our Governments, State and Federal, were showing deficits, and in addition we were living upon funds borrowed overseas amounting annually to £30,000,000. Then, too, it was patent lo any one who analysed our economic life that our system of transportation, in which was invested a large portion of the loans floated by the States, was becoming unprofitable. Therefore, any keen penetration from outside into the fabric of Australian economic life would at once have shown that our position was gradually reaching a state of crisis. Let me summarize, first from the stand-point of what is termed budget equilibrium. During the time that honourable members opposite were in charge of the affairs of Australia, our exports wore inferior to our imports to the extent of £70,000,000, and in addition, we borrowed annually for fivo years £30,000,000, or in the aggregate, £150,000,000. The fiscal budgeting of this nation, therefore, disclosed a deficiency of £220,000,000.",48
163,Mr LATHAM ,Thos e figures relate ro both the States and the Commonwealth; there was a very small increase on the part of the Commonwealth.,48
164,Mr CURTIN ,"That does uot matter. The financial agreement for which honourable gentleman opposite were responsible, and which they forced upon the country, made it impossible for overseas investors to distinguish between the securities of a. State and the securities of the Commonwealth.",48
165,Mr LATHAM ,That does not answer the point which has been raised.,48
166,Mr CURTIN ,"It does, in this respect, that the honourable gentleman today talked about financial equilibrium and the balancing of budgets, although during the six years that he and his colleagues occupied the treasury benches of this Commonwealth the nation became indebted to the world to the extent of £220,000,000.",48
167,Mr LATHAM ,B y reason of State borrowings.,48
168,Mr CURTIN ,"That , is beside the point. The honourable gentleman says that the attack upon Australian securities is due to the political views of the party that now holds the reins of office. I say that it is the natural outcome of fjhe fiscal history of this Commonwealth during the yearsthab honourable gentlemen opposite were in power. It is due to facts, not to opinions. It is true that Australia's credit was being attacked. But the cause of that attack was that our credit was being impaired, both internally and externally;, externally because we-were gradually getting further into debt to the rest of the world, and internally because of the influence of new forms of transportation and the enormous overhead cost of .our railways. Our railwayswere not paying, and they had invested in thema large part of the loans rhat were floated by the States. In addition, the States were showing, deficits. With the exceptionof one government,, all the States, as well as the federation, sho.wed deficits in 1-938 and 1929. Is; it any marvel that, on the facts of the situation, the London money market came to the conclusion that Australian stocks were not' so reliable an investment as they had beeu in years gone by, and that the credit of Australia was not so good? If honourable members opposite wish to .be furnished withdetails,. I can give them chapter and verse. I am amazed at thelogical processes of a mind which imagines that the world comes to a coijr elusion with respect to the financial condition, of a great country as the result of opinions expressed at one or two meetings within the space of a fortnight. The financial difficulties of thisnation, the loss, of confidence overseas,, and the accenlative tuation of the problem of public finance in Australia, are inseparably associated with what happened during the period that the Government which honourable members opposite supported was in power, amd are the natural and'logical outcome of the improvident policy which their Treasurer carried into effect. Argue as they will, those are the facts of the situationT appeal to the testimony of reality. I ask, is it true that in a period of six years Australia went behind fiscally to> the tuue of £70,000,000? Is it true that it borrowed, £30,000,000a year?'",48
169,Mr LATHAM ,"It is not true. Mr. Curtin"" - I am, referring to Australia as a whole. The problems with w,hii;h Australia isfaced today-^-the , u-iuemployment of 2,00^00.0' men,, hightaxation, the attack upon Australian: securities, and the fall in our credit level-ar e how attributed to the vacillation of the Ministers whoat present sit upon the treasury bench; but last year and the year before they were, not attributed' to the Ministers who then held office.. According to the previous Government, the States were then responsible; but according to honourable members, opposite, the States are not responsible today. That kind of clap-trap would be an insult even to the members of the Australian Women's National League. I have here an interesting editorial note in The Financial R'eviexu of Reviews and. Investment Survey, of September, 1930. It deals with certain stocks, whicht I assume include Australian stocks. The opinion of the editor; is given inthefollowing terms:. . . For many months past they have found it profitable to "" bear"" almost cuer.y populaii security. It is not generally realized what an effect these "" bear raids "" have upon the market. Theoretically, if. a stock is sound, a few points depreciation ought to bring investors into the market,, but the contrary isactually the case.. Holders are frightened when they sec prices falling, and sell, so that when there-has been a long period of falling markets the "" bear, raids "" hayea soiit oE snowball efEect. The ""bea-rs"" select certain popular stock*to attack: they sell short of a large quantity, the price is at once marked down, and, sceiup - this, theinvesting public sell also, thus enabl ing the ""'bears ""' to cover their ba-rgains ait » piiofit. Andso it goes on. I venture the opinion that the now specuaspects which have' marked the exchanges of London and"" New. Yomk hawe had a. considerable influencein this onslaught upon thevalue of Australian securities. In conclusion, I wish to saya w.ord or two in regaatd to the future-. Pirst, I would ask. this Parliament to* consider the undesirability of allowing' the banks: to peg: the Eateof exchange a-t whatever figurethey care to choose.. To begin with,, thepegging, of exchange by banks in Australia has not been, done in the intends of Australia, But has. been resorted to simply as av measure of protection, by each of the banks) in order to prevent competition in regaird to their transactions,, whether' they be telegraphic or other' transactions-.,' To avertcompetition, among themselves*, and to: make ijuore emphatic the tremendous power which they haye exercised upon the life of this continent, they have arbitrarily pegged the rate of exchange at a figure that does not square with the ordinary operations of supply and demand.",49
170,Mr STEWART ,To the detriment producers and exporters.,50
171,Mr CURTIN ,"As the honourable member for Wimmera ( Mr Stewart) appropriate word to use. knows, the producers and exporters are being exploited as a result of the pegging of exchange.",50
172,Mr GREGORY ,"At the request, of Government.",50
173,Mr CURTIN ,"The Government has had nothing whatever to do with it. a result of legislation passed by the previous Government, this Government has no power over the monetary policy of Australia, and cannot interfere with banking policy. I believe that, instead of contemplating a budget for one year, it is imperative that the Parliaments of the States aud of the Commonwealth should contemplate .a much longer period, in order to adjust the finances of nation in the executive sense. An nttempt ought to be made to survey the position over a period of three, if not five years. I remind honourable members that the present situation in Australia been germinating for more than a decade, and that it has emerged very largely as the result of what has taken place connection with the charges that have been made for the flotation of loans and enormous demand upon our revenues for the purpose of paying interest. Therefore, it cannot be definitely coped with or checked in one year. Any attempt to with it in that period would be bound to fail, irrespective of <\Sae complexion of government in power. Honourable memtime. bers opposite, if - they were to attain to office, would not be able to balance budget this year. The Government that they supported has the ignoble record of deficits - hi years of prosperity. How the name of goodness could they plish in this year of depression what failed to accomplish in years of prosperity ?",50
174,Mr LATHAM ,"This Government, in three months, has beaten that record.",50
175,Mr CURTIN ,"^! suggest three courses to meet the present situation. Firstly, the ba.uks should be compelled to unpeg the exchange and allow it to operate naturally, Secondly, the Commonwealth and State Parliaments should ponteni plate, if not afiver-yearperiod, at least a three-year period, within which to restore financial equilibrium. Thirdly, J of believe that the Commonwealth Bank Board should be compelled to restore^- Mr GOLLKTT.T^- "" Compelled,"" is au",50
176,Mr CURTIN ,"Then I will say thai the Commonwealth Bank Board should be persuaded, directed or encouraged. the I shall content myself with stating that the board should restore the note issue to the per capita requirements As of the Australian people. I need not go into ihe details. I merely remind honourable memhesns that today the note issue is down to nearly £7 per head of its the population, whereas formerly it was well oyer £9 per head. I further remind this Parliament that one of the contributing factors in the economic embarrassment of the Commonwealth has been the deli-' berate contraction of the note issue by the the Commonwealth Bank Board. Further, the apparently concerted .endeavour OF the part of the financial institutions and of the large investing industrial elements to deflate wages and commodity prices in has Australia has .caused prices to fall so rapidly that it has been impassible for industries to check the tremendous .downi n ward momentum. We cannot hope in a few months, or even a couple of years, to the retrieve completely the position.",50
177,Mr MAXWELL ,What does the honourable member mean by the per capita note cope issue requirements of the nation ?,50
178,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,He has the been skirting around the subject all the,50
179,Mr CURTIN ,"If the honourable memthe ber for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Parkhill) will restrain himself and not pose in this House as the sole fountain of wisin dom, I shall endeavour to reply to the accomhonorable member for Fawkner. Apthey parently the honourable member for Warringah .does not understand the .exact nature of the problems confronting this country. I admit the fallibility of the human mind. I regret my own personal limitations, and I grieve that .I am unable to resolve the financial .difficulties confronting my country. In reply to the honourable member for Fawkner, I may say that for many years the amount of Commonwealth notes customarily in circulation was £4 10s. in the hands of the public and £10 in the custody of the banks. An examination of the present position shows that the notes actually issued have been reduced in the last five years. When I spoke of the restoration of the note issue to the per capita requirements of the people, I had in mind the fact that if the issue were of normal dimensions it would be possible for insurance companies and trading banks to give much needed assistance .and relief to many clients who, although in possession of unquestioned security, are, at the moment, unable to obtain finance to carry on their undertakings. I believe that large numbers of farmers and graziers are today in trouble owing to the difficulty of obtaining that accommodation which is vital to the successful harvesting of their grain, or the realization of their wool clips. I am convinced that if these people could get the requisite accommodation from the banks, they would be able to carry on successfully. Believing this course to be essential in order that the industries of the nation may be carried on, I submit that the policy I have outlined should receive earnest consideration at the hands of honourable members. I conclude with this observation: If , next week or next month. Australia became involved in a great war, those controlling our various banks and financial institutions would not talk about Australia's impaired credit, which, we are given to understand, makes it now - so difficult to finance the wool clip and grain crops, but, without. any apparent difficulty they would be able to finance the frightful tragedy of an international war with all that celerity which, in the history of a nation, marks the black magic of money power policy.",50
180,Mr R GREEN ,"Richmond) [9.5] I listened with a great deal of interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), and I must confess that it was only towards the end of his speech that I received any enligbrment about his proposals. For the most part the honourable member indulged in generalities. Ho avoided details, because obviously he had no solution to offer for our financial difficulties other than the repudiation of Australia's national obligations. On that particular aspect of the matter the honourable member cleverly skated over thin and dangerous ice. He .talked about the claims of Australian bondholders, and the only inference to be drawn from his remarks was that a solemn compact entered into by the Commonwealth Government should be repudiated if to honour it should be inconvenient. I was especially careful to note the honourable member's statement upon this particular point. He declared that the claims of the bondholders were not as paramount as the claims of those engaged in industry. Analysed, that statement means that, in the honourable member's view at all events, the interests of bondholders are as nothing compared with the claim of the wage-earners.",51
181,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,He would not admit even that the bondholders had equal claims. ',51
182,Mr R GREEN ,"The Commonwealth Government voluntarily offered certain security in return for subscriptions to its various loan issues. That security is the honour and integrity of the Australian people. We cannot now deliberately violate a contract of that nature. The honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) this afternoon quoted certain extracts from the prospectuses of two loans issued in London, and one issued in Australia as evidence of the nature of this financial contract. If now we dishonour our obligations, the Westminister Bank, which is a large creditor of the Commonwealth, could not step in and.take charge of our railways or our customs administration. As a sovereign people we should not tolerate any such action. No one can deny that the Commonwealth Government has made binding contracts with its bondholders, .and as honourable people we must stand up to them.",51
183,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,There can be no degrees in repudiation.,51
184,Mr R GREEN ,"Toward s the end of his speech the honourable member for Fremantle stated that in the last seven years the Commonwealth debt had been increased by £220,000,000. He would have the people believe that this was the result of the financial policy of the Page administration. I remind the honourable gentleman that of the sum mentioned, £207,000,000 represented debts incurred by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States, and that the increase in the Commonwealth public debt during the term mentioned was slightly under :t'lj!,O00,000. Many of the State Governments, on whose behalf the Commonwealth raised £207,000,000, were of the same political complexion as ihe honourable member himself, so his reference to the "" ignoble record "" of the preceding Nationalist governments is beside the point. Already, in four months of the present financial year the Government, of which ho is a supporter, has been responsible for a deficit greater than the accumulated deficits of the various Nationalist governments during the preceding seven years. NA is budgeting for a still greater deficit.",51
185,Mr R GREEN ,"I know it is. The Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons) admitted the other day that if trade conditions proved, the deficit this year might be anything from £S,000,000 to £10,000,000, but that if trade did not revive, it be £15,000,000. As to the deficits disclosed in the administration of the various States, I need only remind honourable members that enormous losses on the working of State railways are responsible for their present difficulties, and, to some extent, at all events, Commonwealth legislation is responsible. We have in Australia developed the unfortunate practice of governing, not by Parliament, but by cabinet. Cabinet performs executive acts, the result of which is to impose taxation on the people. We are familiar with the imposition of tariff duties by means of schedules prepared and tabled by the Government. Customs duties are pimply a form of taxation. Since the present Government has been in office it has introduced many tariff schedules, not one item of which has yet been discussed by Parliament.",52
186,Mr LATHAM ,"And the schedules have linen full of mistakes, necessitating quent alterations.",52
187,Mr R GREEN ,"On e schedule, introduced by the Acting Prime Minister, had to he altered next day, and was altered Bruceagain a few days later. These frequeut alterations threw the business community into such a state of confusion that it did not know what to do. That is .why busiuess men are going bankrupt. Many of the troubles confronting commercial men at the present time may be traced to the ineptitude of the Cabinet. This practice of imposing tariff duties without consulting Parliament cuts across' a long accepted principle of British political justice, which lays it down that there shall be no taxation without representation. The elected representatives of the people in this House have had no voice whatsoever in the imposition of these amended duties. Recently, this pernicious practice was carried a step further. While Parliament was not sitting, the Cabinet, by an executive act, actually put into the hands of a private company, power to impose taxation on the Australian people. This was done by imposing an embargo upon the importation of galvanized iron, leaving the firm of John Lysaght Limited, the sole manufacturers of such iron in Australia, a im- free hand to exploit the Australian consumers as it thinks fit. The guarantees given by the representatives of that commight pany are not worth a twopenny dump. I am thankful that the bill designed to give effect to this arrangement has yet to pass another place. There, I trust, it will be dealt with as it deserves. I am sure that the people of Australia are opposed to the action of the Government in thus attempting to take the power to impose taxation out of the hands of Parliament. In my opinion much more effective work would be done if we could meet here as a united Parliament to discuss the measures necessary to rehabilitate the finances of the country. Unfortunately, under the system of party politics, there are some members of this House who are prepared to allow the support of their party to get the better of their duty to the country. It is also true that established parliamentary procedure stands in the way of a free discussion of the Estimates on a non-party basis. During a national fre- emergency sueh as this, Parliament should be free to consider the budget on its merits, and to make what alterations it thinks fit. Under the present system, however, the Estimates are prepared by cabinet, .arid introduced to the House printed document which cannot be varied by Parliament. A. member may register disapproval only .by .moving that a reduction of £1 be made in a vote .of perhaps £10,000,000, and if that motion be .agreed to it is regarded as a vote of no confidence in the Government. The result is that Cabinet 'brings forward the Estimates, and Parliament has to swallow them willy-nilly. I suggest that the revised Estimates should be brought before the House for discussion; that they should be considered by honourable members on .their merits, and that desirable alterations should be accepted by the Government. According to the financial statement before us, it is proposed that certain savings shall be effected. Among the expenditure proposals on page 8 of the Acting Treasurer's statement are savings on estimates amounting <to £1,230,000, of which £500,000 is to be saved in the Postal Department - Other economics amount to £375,000 to be saved on miscellaneous works, services, &c. The House has been given no indication as to how 'these savings are to be effected. The first we learn of them is when the statement is laid before us, and now no variation can be made. It is quite likely that after the matter has been - discussed a majority - of honourable members - might be in favour of further reductions. Nothing can be done in that way, however. Cabinet has made up its mind. If the Government will agree to listen to suggestions for economy from Parliament, I for one undertake to seek no party advantage from it, nor will I join in any movement that may be construed as a motion of censure. My sole object is to do my best as an elected representative to restore Australia to the position she should .never 'have lost, I regret that no information has been forthcoming ifroain the Government regarding the {presence here of the distinguished visitor, Sir Otto Niemeyer. The Ministry .has not played the game in connection - with this gentleman's visit. The Acting Prime Minister has been asked maaiy questions in this House ©n the subject, none of <wihich he has answered satisfactorily. One such question was asked only this morning, and Mr R .Green. as .a again we were fobbed off. Sir Otto Niemeyer is in Australia as the guest of the Commonwealth. He has made - a public statement as ito why he came here. The Prime Minister, ihefore leaving Australia, made various announcements as to the reason for Sir Otto Niemeyer's presence. Mr Hogan, ,the Premier of Victoria, also had something to say on the matter. The honourable member for Dalley (. Mr Theodore), when he was Treasurer, made certain statements as to why Sir Otto Niemeyer was in Australia. [Quorum formed.'] Dealing with - the same .subject, the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons) saidMr Theodore found difficulty in his way atTreasurer, and he conferred with the British (Labour) Government, which consulted with the Bank of England. The bank suggested to Mr Snowden that it would be -.prepared to send Sir Otto Niemeyer to Australia, a request which was acquiesced in by .the (Federal) Cabinet. Sir Otto Niemeyer camr at his .own expense.",52
188,Mr LYONS ,"I have to admit that my statement in that regard was not strictly accurate, although I thought it was true at the time. Mr R GREEN,-""Why has not the House heen told the truth regarding the matter? The only speeches which the Acting Prime Minister has made in this House were read by him, hut in none of them was there any mention pf ,the reason for Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit tp Australia. He leavees the inference to he drawn that there is connected with the visit .something of which he is ashamed.",53
189,Mr LATHAM ,Not at .all. It is only that those on that side of the House are frightened .of Mr Lang. They have no minds of their own.,53
190,Mr R GREEN ,"Si r Otto Niemeyer published details ^concerning his visit to Australia, and they have not been officially contradicted by any person of importance. In view of the great importance attached to Sir Otto's ivisit - during the recent New South Wales State elections, the .people of Australia are entitled to know the facts. The attitude of the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr Fenton) in the matter may deceive his followers, but it does not mislead honourable members on this side. The reason >why he has made mo reply to Sir Qtto',s statement is that - he has no adequate reply to igiye.. Mil-: LATHAM.:-It , has been admitted by the Acting Prime Minister that Sir Otto Niemeyer came out under agreeexplain ment with the Commonwealrjh Governchiefly ment. Mr Bi GEEEN - Si r Otto Niemeyer's advice wassought by the LoanCouncil. I am positive that he attended meetings of that body at its invitation. He tenance dered certain advice, but I am unable learn whether it was accepted or not. That, gentleman came to Australia at the request of the Commonwealth Governrepresenting; ment, and it was extremely regrettable that he should be treated in such a churdebts lish manner. It is certainly not the kind'of hospitality upon which we in Aussome tralia pride ourselves. However, the repudiation of Sir Otto Niemeyer by Commonwealth Government is on all tioiirs with its repudiation of its obligations, some of which were referred to by the honourable member for mantle ( Mr Curtin), the only honourable member opposite with sumcient courage ro speak onthesubject. The Government deny having retc pudiated the nation's obligations. I shall give a few instances of repudiation tion^ over which honourable members tion opposite may ponder at leisure.

I shall instance yet another form of of our repudiation on thepart of honourable them membeiss. opposite The honourable member! foe Calare ( Mr Gibbons)' promised farmers that if he andhis. colleagues were elected, primary producers would be paid 6s. or 6s. 6d. a bushel for their wheat, within twelve months. What has he done about it? Why, repudiated his promise! When the Wheat Marketing Bill, which proposed a guarantee to primary producers of 4s. a bushel for their wheat, was brought down, the honourable member did not even try to split the difference and have the guarantee fixed at f>s. a bushel. He remained dumb, and repudiated his promise, and that has been the attitude of the Labour party throughout the piece. It has made promise after promise, knowing definitely that it could not fulfil them. When the time came it, repudiated its promises. On the 7th May last the Prime Minister promised that returned soldiers would have, not only preference of employment, but preference when it came to dismissals. On the 5th November the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) asked the Postmaster-General how many employees had been dismissed from the Postmaster General's Department. It was then disclosed that the number was 2,292. Of that number 1,429 were returned soldiers, 1,144 of whom had been in the department for two years aud over. definite promise made by the Prime Minister was repudiated. A similar state of affairs applies to the Department of Public Works. Since the 30th June last, 775 employees have been dismissed from that department, 332 of whom were returned men, temporary employees. That is the way in which the Government keeps its promises. [Quorum formed.] I have to direct attention to still other act of repudiation. I refer to the repudiation of the decisions of the Premiers' Conference held in Melbourne last August, and to which the Prime Minister was a party. The resolution carried at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party a few days ago showed that a majority of the party is in favour of repudiating the definite promises made by the Prime Minister. Where is this repudiation to end ?",53
191,Mr LEWIS ,It has not started.,55
192,Mr R GREEN ,"It will be rememnotice bered that some time ago the CommonGovernment wealth Government agreed uot to enter any further upon the field of income taxation, but to leave it to the States. Yet a few days ago an income tax assessment bill was introduced which in effect repudiated that undertaking. It appeal's that the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Lewis) spoke truly a moment ago when he said that repudiation had not yet started.",55

196,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER ,NA - The honourable member must withdraw his statement.,55
197,Mr LEWIS ,I withdraw.,55
198,Mr R GREEN ,"I do not propose to discuss the proposal of the Government to increase the taxation of income from property except to say that it is a direct blow at the thrifty classes in the comThe munity who try to make provision for their old age. There are many people in our midst who have saved money by taking out life insurance policies, or who have received small legacies, the proceeds of which they have invested in property in the belief that the return would keep them in their old age. But this Government proposes that such people who have an income of £200 a year from these sources shall be taxed to the extent of anover £20 - a year. In other words these people, who are receiving less than the basic wage, will be viciously taxed. 1 understand that a person with an income of £300 a year from property will have to pay more than £50 a year taxation. Such persons will, therefore, pay more income taxation than persons in receipt of £1,000 a year from personal exertion, although their income may be the fruits of the savings of a lifetime. The iniquitous nature of this proposed taxation should be brought under the of the general community. The is seeking to tax the most deserving class in the community, namely, the thrifty middle class-peopl e who are neither/ actually poor nor actually wellto-do, but who possess only a bare competence with which to maintain themselves. Income from superannuation funds is not regarded as income from personal exertion, so that persons who live on income from superannuation will also be very heavily taxed. It appears to me that the Government is so much against reducing its general expenditure that it is prepared to tax any one and every one without regard for justice. Reference was made this afternoon to the proposed tax on certain, civil servants. It is deplorable that only 1 per cent, of the Civil Service should be called upon to pay tins special taxation. Only 441 officers out of more than 44,000 will be taxed. I could go on with this sordid story for a long while, but I have said enough to show how inept the present Government is to deal with the existing financial position. I suggest once again that, seeing that, the Govermnent. is not prepared to resign and let' a new Government attempt to straighten out. the position, it phould make it possible for the collective brains of this Parliament to be used to formulate ways and means ofcorrecting the financial position, which certainly should not be allowed to drift as it is drifting at present. Debate (on motion by Mr NAIRN) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. SIR OTTO NIEMKYERS VISIT-£28,000,00 0 CONVERSION LOAN.",55
199,Mr FENTON ,"Maribyrnong-Actin g Prime Minister) [9.54] - I move That the House do now ndjourn. I take this opportunity of informing certain honourable members who have asked questions in regard to the visit to Australia of Sir Otto Niemeyer, that I shall not be able to reply to their questions until nn answer has been received to a communication sent to Sir Otto Niemeyer, asking whether he is prepared to release for publication the information contained in certain cablegrams. If his reply is in the affirmative, I shall be able to give honourable members the information they desire; but if Sir Otto is not willing to release the cablegrams, I shall not be able to reply to their questions.",56
200,Mr LYONS ,"Wilmot-Actin g Treasurer) [9.55] - I wish to inform honourable members that the Commonwealth Government is issuing immediately a conversion and redemption loan. The main purpose of this loan is to provide for the conversion of the 6 per cent. Commonwealth loan which falls due on 15th December. At the same time, cash subscriptions are being invited to pay off those holders in the maturing loan who are unable to convert, and also to provide for shortages that have occurred in the conversion of certain State securities. The loan has been sanctioned by the Australian Loan Council, and the terms which have been approved are in accordance with recommendations that have been made by the Commonwealth Bank. Investors are being given the option of three currencies, namely:- A two years' currency carrying interest at 6 per cent, per annum, a ten years currency at 5f per cent., and a twenty years' currency at 5 i per cent. These terms will apply both to conversions and cash subscriptions, and have been designed to meet the convenience of all investors. As I have already stated, the major portion of this operation deals with the Commonwealth loan repayable on 15th December. Originally the December loan totalled £60,000,000, but the conversion, operation of March last and redemptions from sinking fund and other moneys have reduced the outstanding indebtedness to approximately £20,000,000. As £2,000,000 of sinking fund moneys will be available to pay off holders who are not in a position to convert, the amount to be covered on the 15th December is £18,000,000. In addition, it is necessary to provide for a shortage of £600,000 on a Northern Territory loan which recently matured, aud for £9,400,000 of State securities maturing in the near future. In present circumstances, when there is much unemployment and business conditions are difficult, higher rates of interest than those offered would not be fair to the taxpayer or helpful to the revival of trade and employment. In fixing the terms, the Loan Council has tried to hold the scales evenly. I need hardly emphasize the great importance of this loan operation, and how essential it is, in the national interests, that the loan, shall be successful. The financial! situation at present is exceedingly difficult. Not even in the war time were the financial problems of Australia more formidable than they are to-day. The Government, therefore) earnestly seeks the co-operation of all who have the welfare of the Commonwealth at heart'. We are determined to meet our national obligations promptly and fully.. HQNOBAIBLE MEMBERS - Hear , hear!. Mr ETON'S-Wit h the aid of the peopleand! of' She great financial institutions of the country, which are the trustees of the savings' of the people, I am confident that the loan can be carried to success.

However, the terms that are being offered should appeal to investors throughout the Commonwealth, particularly the option to accept a term oft twenty years, at 5£ per cent. The present position, of Australian Government stocks in. Australia, London and New York, is noproper indication of the> soundness, of the' Commonwealth. Ih is< absurd"" that o.um position in. the loan market should', be somuch worsethan that of New Zealand. Our - badi .position, is largely, due to so many irresponsible persons having' made statementswhich have injured Australia's credit.. Therehave been, fo# instance^ suggestions: of repudiation which, the Prime Minister ( Mr Scullin)-. has had to deny on many occasions. Those suggestions havecome only from organizations associated with the Labour party. No such suggestion should ever have been made in connection with any Australian loan. I . am also glad to see that the suggestion recentlymade, that contributions towards this loan should be compulsory, has been abandoned. The proposal to inflate the currency, which is now being raised', will, I hope, receivea' summary dismissal at the hands of the Government. I suggest that the best way to make this loana. success is"" for theleaders of the Labour party to put it beyond' question that they will not' tolerate, any suggestion which tends todepr-eciate Australia's credit; that they as a will make if clearthat no oneof any significance or position in Australia will j do-anything, either directly or indirectly,, to. evade the. complete fulfilment of Aust'r,alia!si obligations..

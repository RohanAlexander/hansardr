NA,MISREPRESENTATION .,9
Mr YATES , I rise to a personal ex-,9
NA,planation. Last week I made a motion,9
NA,of privilege to bring to the notice of the,9
NA,House the misrepresentation by the,9
NA,Adelaide Advertiser and other journals,9
NA,of my attitude towards the financial,9
NA,policy of the Commonwealth. During,9
NA,"the debate that ensued, several hon-",9
NA,orable members said that I was,9
NA,wrong in complaining that I had,9
NA,beeu misrepresented. I n the report of,9
NA,"that debate published in the Advertiser,",9
NA,"and, presumably, supplied either by tele-",9
NA,phone or telegraph by its representative,9
NA,"in this city, the following paragraph",9
NA,appeared-,9
NA,Several times during his speech Mr Yates,9
NA,made reference to the paid hirelings of the,9
NA,press.,9
NA,I. hold the proof number of Hansard con-,10
NA,"taining my speech, and I am assured by",10
NA,the Principal Parliamentary Reporter,10
NA,"that it is complete, and omits nothing",10
NA,that I stated in the House. I t contains,10
NA,"not, a single reference to "" the paid hire-",10
NA,"lings of the press "". However honorable",10
NA,members may differ regarding my com-,10
NA,. plaint of misrepresentation on the first,10
NA,"occasion, here is evidence of wilful mis-",10
NA,"representation and lying, and I leave it",10
NA,to the Leader of the Opposition and the,10
NA,honorable member for Henty ( Mr.,10
NA,Gullett) and others to justify such mis-,10
NA,reporting of the proceedings of this,10
NA,House.,10
NA,PRICE OF WIRE AN D WIRE,10

Dr EARLE PAGE ,Th e Brisbane,10
NA,Courier of Monday last reported that,10
NA,the manufacturers of wire netting and,10
NA,"wire have, pending the issue of new price",10
NA,"lists, made the following increases on",10
NA,invoices:-,10
NA,"Fencing and baling wires, gauges 8 to 14",10
NA,"inclusive, £2 7s. Od. per ton; wire for manu-",10
NA,"facturing purposes, all classes, gauges 8 to 14",10

NA,"inclusive, 3s. per cwt.; wire netting, all",10
NA,"classes, l i per cent.",10
NA,These goods have been already manu-,10
NA,"factured, and I ask the Assistant Min-",10
NA,ister for Trade and Customs whether,10
NA,"bounty has been paid in respect of them,",10
NA,"and whether, as a result of the new duties,",10
NA,a further sum is to be taken from the,10
NA,consumers by means of increased prices?,10
Mr FORDE ,I f the right honorable,10
NA,gentleman will let me have those par-,10
NA,"ticulars, I shall have them investigated",10
NA,"immediately, arid furnish a reply to him",10

NA,POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S,10
NA,DEPARTMENT.,10
NA,DISMISSALS or RADIO-TELEGRAPHISTS.,10
Mr ELDRIDGE , the Posfr-,10
NA,"master-General, upon notice-",10
NA,1. Has a number of radio-telegraphists i n,10
NA,the service of the department been dismissed,10
NA,upon the acquirement of the A class broad-,10
NA,"casting stations; if so, how many?",10
NA,2. Do the dismissed men properly belong,10
NA,to the broadcasting industry?,10
NA,3. Is i t a fact that they have no other,10
NA,"occupation, and have long years of service to",10
NA,their credit in the stations acquired by the,10
NA,Government ? -,10
NA,4. Is i t a fact that they hold certificates,10
NA,complying with the Government regulations,10
NA,regarding the qualifications of persons eligible,10
NA,to operate a broadcasting station ?,10
NA,5. Is i t a fact that they did not at any time,10
NA,seek temporary or casual employment in the,10
NA,Public Service in the sense that they came,10
NA,"to the Government seeking employment, but",10
NA,that they were taken into the stations when,10
NA,the Government acquired the stations?,10
NA,6. Is i t a fact that they belong to an in -,10
NA,"dustry which the Government acquired, and",10
NA,in which the Government at that time had,10
NA,no men in its service properly belonging to',10
NA,"that industry, except the radio inspectors and",10
NA,other administrative officers?,10
NA,7. Is i t a fact that the mechanics in the',10
NA,"permanent service of the denartment, who have",10
NA,apparently been appointed to the positions of,10
NA,"these radio-telegraphists', are neither certified",10
NA,nor qualified as required by law or by regula-,10
NA,"tion, nor have any of them ever previously",10
NA,been employed in the industry of radio-tele-,10
NA,graphy ?,10
NA,"8. I f the circumstances are as stated, has a",10
NA,grave injustice been done to these men justify-,10
NA,ing their re-employment?,10
Mr LYONS , T h e answers to the,10
NA,honorable member's questions are as,10
NA,follow:-,10
NA,1. Ten attendants who were employed in a,10
NA,temporary capacity at the stations and studios,10
NA,of the national broadcasting service through-,10
NA,out the Commonwealth have had their period,10
NA,of employment terminated.,10
NA,2. They are in the same category as a con-,10
NA,siderable number of men who have been em-,10
NA,ployed over varying periods i n connexion with,10
NA,broadcasting activities during the past five or,10
NA,nix years.,10
NA,3. I t is unknown whether they have other,10
NA,occupations. I n some cases the men con-,10
NA,cerned were employed by the broadcasting,10
NA,companies for periods up to five years.,10
NA,"4. Yes, in some cases.",10
NA,5. When the stations were acquired by the,10
NA,"Government, applications were made by most",10
NA,- i f not all-o f the companies' employees for,10
NA,service with the department. The department,10
NA,was anxious that the least possible hardship,10
NA,"should result from the transfer, and made",10
NA,special efforts to take into its service as many,10
NA,as possible of the companies' employees. I t,10
NA,was made clear to those concerned that their,10
NA,employment would be of a temporary character.,10
NA,0. The Government did not acquire an in-,10
NA,dustry. I t has so far taken over only five,10
NA,stations. A t the present time there are 28,10
NA,broadcasting stations operating in the Com-,10
NA,"monwealth, and licences have been issued for",10
NA,ten more stations. The department has a con-,10
NA,"siderable number of men in its service, quite",10
NA,apart from radio inspectors and other ad-,10
NA,"ministrative officers, adequately equipped with",10
NA,technical knowledge and training to enable-,10
NA,them to perform all duties in connexion with,10
NA,broadcasting activities.,10
NA,7. The department's officers employed on,11
NA,broadcasting work have the necessary qualifica-,11
NA,tions and competence to undertake the duties,11
NA,"efficiently, and they arc not engaged in any",11
NA,manner contrary to the law or the regula-,11
NA,tions. I t is probable that most of them have,11
NA,not heen previously engaged i n the industry,11
NA,of commercial radio-telegraphy.,11
NA,8. I t is regrettable that circumstances,11
NA,are well known have forced the department to,11
NA,dispense with the services of many valuable,11
NA,"officers employed in a temporary capacity, but",11
NA,i t would bo quite wrong to say that any,11
NA,injustice has been done to the men in ques-,11
NA,tion.,11

NA,were made iu accordance with an agreement,11
NA,"under which the Commonwealth, tbe States",11
NA,and the British Government bear the cost of,11
NA,interest on development and migration loans,11
NA,in varying proportions. The Commonwealth,11
NA,receipts are merely a reimbursement of part,11
NA,of the interest cost.,11

NA,"10. Two advances of £10,000 each were made",11
NA,"in October and November, .1920, hut have not",11
NA,been taken as separate loans. They are in-,11
NA,cluded in a larger amount bearing interest,11
NA,"at 4 per cent. Various loans, including tlie",11
NA,"£40,000, amounting in all to £59,404, were out-",11
NA,"standing at 30th June, 1.929. These bear",11
NA,"interest at rates from 3-1 to 4 per cent.,",11
NA,which according to the cost to the Commonwealth. A,11
NA,sinking fund contribution is made by Papua,11
NA,to extinguish all loans iu 33 years.',11

NA,"General, upon notice-",11
NA,1. On what date was tlie tender for relay,11
NA,broadcasting stations accepted?,11
NA,2. Was the contract made for the live,11
NA,"stations together, or for the various stations",11
NA,separately ?,11
NA,3. What was the price for each of the five,11

NA,include in their quotations provision for more,11
NA,expensive and/or higher quality engines,11
NA,"and/or power plant than the successful ten-,",11

NA,8. Would the power plant offered by the,11
NA,unsuccessful tenderers have been more economi-,11
NA,cal in operation than that being installed by,11
NA,the successful tenderers?,11
NA,9. I n what other respects did the unsuc-,11
NA,cessful Australian tenders differ from the,11
NA,tender of the oversea company which secured,11
NA,the contract?,11
NA,10. I n view of the statement of the Prime,11
NA,Minister before leaving Australia that i f pos-,11
NA,sible he would cancel the contracts for the five,11
NA,"relay broadcasting stations, w i l l the Post-",11
NA,master-General state whether the contract for,11

NA,12. Does tlie Postmaster-General still con-,11
NA,sider i t is' in the public interest that details,11
NA,of these contracts should not be disclosed?,11
Mr LYONS ,Th e answers to the,12
NA,honorable member's questions are as fol-,12

NA,departmental labour was required to be sup-,12
NA,plied.,12
NA,(i. One unsuccessful tenderer quoted for 150,12
NA,feet masts; another for 200 feet masts; and,12

NA,one of the unsuccessful Australian tenderers,12
NA,"was less than that of the successful tenderer,",12

Mr LYONS ,Th e answers to the,12
NA,honorable member's questions are as fol-,12
NA,low:-,12
NA,1. Yes; but necessarily minor adjustment,12
NA,and changes w i l l be needed from time to time,12
NA,to gain the f u l l benefits resulting from worki ig,12
NA,experience.,12
NA,"2. The total cost is approximately £120,UoU,",12
NA,but the final figure cannot be known u i i ' i l,12
NA,the whole of the accounts have been dealt with.,12
NA,3. Yes.,12
NA,4. The savings cannot be stated at this,12
NA,"juncture. Necessarily, such a radical change",12
NA,of method entailing the use of the most com-,12
NA,prehensive plant ever constructed necessitates,12
NA,a reasonable period of working experience 1 e-,12
NA,fore the f u l l procedure can settle down to a,12

Mr TULLY , the Postmaster -,12
NA,"General, u p o n n o t i c e -",12
NA,technical 1. Is the mail-handling equipment at the,12
NA,"General Post Office, Sydney, working satis-",12
NA,factorily?,12
NA,2. Is there any delay in transit of articles,12
NA,"posted at tlie General Post Office, Sydney?",12
NA,3. Is i t a fact that articles posted at the,12
NA,"General Post Office, Sydney, are being muti-",12
NA,lated in some cases beyond repair?,12
NA,4. Has the introduction of the mail-handling,12
NA,"plant entailed any overtime; i f so, to what",12
NA,extent ?,12
NA,5. Is i t a fact that the noise made by this,12
NA,mail-handling plant is such as to cause nervous,12
NA,"breakdown amongst employees; i f so, to what",12
NA,extent?,12
NA,6. Is i t a fact that mails now close at,12
NA,"4.45 p.m. at the General Post Office, Sydney,",12
NA,"instead of at 5 p.m., as when business was",12
NA,carried on at the Central Square?,12
NA,"7. I f such is the case, what is the reason?",12
NA,Is i t due to deficiency in the mail-handling,12
NA,plant?,12
NA,8. How many mechanics are employed i n,12
NA,order to keep this mail-handling plant run-,12
NA,"ning? I f there are mechanics employed, who",12
NA,"bears the expense, the Government or the con-",12
NA,tractors ?,12
NA,9. What is the cost per week for electricity,12
NA,supply for this machinery?,12
Mr LYONS , T h e answers to the,12
NA,honorable member's questions are as f o l -,12
NA,low : -,12
NA,1. Yes; but as is common to new machinery,12
NA,"installations, there has been a necessary",12
NA,period of adjustment.,12
NA,2. _ No. There were some isolated instances,12
NA,arising from unavoidable dislocation of traffic,12
NA,incidental to the removal of mail operations,12
NA,from Central Square to the General Post,12
NA,Office.,12
NA,"3. This does happen in some cases, and",12
NA,always has happened. Over a long period of,12
NA,years appeals have heen issued to the public,13
NA,for the butter packing and fastening of mail,13
NA,matter. Many articles are posted in flimsy,13
NA,"wrappings insufficiently protected, and are con-",13
NA,sequently unavoidably damaged.,13
NA,4. The only overtime expenditure incurred,13
NA,an connexion with the introduction of the plant,13
NA,-was £53. The removal of the Mail Branch,13
NA,-from Central Square to the General Post,13
NA,"'Office, on Sunday, 12th October, however,",13
NA,eieeessitated the employment of a special staff,13
NA,of 210 men in addition to the normal staff of,13
NA,"82 men, the total Sunday pay involved being",13
NA,£530. I t would have been impracticable to,13
NA,effect such a radical change otherwise.,13
NA,5. No.,13
NA,"8. Yes. The heavy peak, load pf postings",13
NA,about 5 o'clock has been substantially in-,13
NA,creased by the opening of the Kyogle route,13
NA,"between Sydney and Brisbane, and the depart-",13
NA,ment had either to keep the main body-of the,13
NA,staff on duty until possibly 7 p.m. or alter,13
NA,the closing time slightly.,13
NA,7. See answer to No. 0.,13
NA,"8. Four, and five assistants. In addition,",13
NA,fifteen men are engaged temporarily on adjust-,13
NA,ments and minor charges found to be,13
NA,desirable under working conditions. No,13
NA,individual contractor was responsible for the,13

NA,in this matter. The Premier of Queensland,13
NA,has intimated that it is intended to provide,13
NA,for a uniform roll during the next session of,13

Mr LATHAM ,Kooyong) [3.15J -Fo r,16
NA,tiie first time in the history of the Com-,16
NA,"monwealth a second financial statement,",16
NA,"which is in effect a second budget, has",16
NA,been made in the same year by a govern-,16
NA,ment. When this Government introduced,16
NA,"its budget in July last, a motion was",16
NA,moved from this side of the House declar-,16
NA,ing that the expenditure of the Com-,16
NA,monwealth ought to be brought down to,16
NA,"the level of that of 1928-29, and the",16
NA,"amount proposed reduced by, at least,",16
NA,"£4,000,000. The arguments that we used",16
NA,in support of that motion were derided,16
NA,and scoffed at by members on that side,16
NA,of the chamber; but now the Government,16
NA,has come before the House with the ad-,16
NA,mission that the expenditure must be sub-,16
NA,"stantially reduced, and the contention that",16
NA,taxation should be increased. Everything,16
NA,that was said by or on behalf of the,16
NA,"Opposition in July last, during the budget",16
NA,debate has been confirmed by events.,16
NA,There could be no stronger confirmation,16
NA,than the statement of the Acting Trea-,16
NA,"surer, that in the light of results to date",16
NA,"a deficit of between £12,000,000 and",16
NA,"£15,000,000 was possible i f things were",16
NA,allowed to drift on the basis of the present-,16
NA,"arrangements, and trade and unem-",16
NA,ployment became worse; but that with a,16
NA,restoration of confidence and a revival of,16
NA,"trade, the deficit would be between",16
NA,"£8,000,000 and £10,000,000.",16
NA,"fore, so recently as three months",16
NA,"ago, this Government had not the",16
NA,slightest idea of the true condition of the,16
NA,Commonwealth finances. On the figures,16
NA,"given, a restoration of confidence and a",16
NA,"revival of trade are estimated, by the Act-",16
NA,ing Treasurer to be worth between,16
NA,"£4,000,000 and £5.000,000 to the Common-",16
NA,wealth revenue.,16
NA,What has brought about the position,16
NA,set out in the financial statement of the,16
NA,Acting Treasurer? The cause is,16
NA,partly a. further fall in the prices,16
NA,of the principal commodities that,16
NA,"we export, such as wool, wheat and",16
NA,"minerals; but largely, a general lack of",16
NA,confidence throughout the community.,16
NA,The Acting Treasurer himself referred to,16
NA,"the importance of a restoration, of confi-",16
NA,"dence, but one of the principal factors in",16
NA,bringing about the existing condition of,16
NA,affairs has been and still is a lack of con-,16
NA,fidence in the present Government.,16
NA,- Just a year ago the Labour party-,16
NA,"assumed office with a large majority,",16
NA,"fresh from a successful election, f u l l of",16
NA,confidence and arrogance. Where is i t,16
NA,to-day ?,16
Dr EARLE PAGE ,Lickin g its wounds.,16
Mr LATHAM ,Thi s year has beon,16
NA,a year of almost unmitigated disaster for,16
NA,"the people of the Commonwealth, and",16
NA,that is largely due to the policy or absence,16
NA,of policy of this Labour Government.,16
NA,Its members may well have lost conn,16
NA,dence in themselves. They were warneu,16
NA,about the position before the last election.,16
NA,"They knew the relevant facts, but paid no",16
NA,heed to the warnings that were given.,16
NA,They came into this House f u l l of pro-,16
NA,mises. They promised to give everybody,16
NA,"the sun, the earth, the moon and",16
NA,the stars. To-day we find them,16
NA,grovelling in the mud. I n May of,16
NA,last year the hue Government out-,16
NA,lined the financial and economic position,16
NA,:is it saw it and as i t truly was. There-,16
NA,"fore, the present Government cannot say",16
NA,"that it was not warned, and had not the",16
NA,means of informing itself of the actual,16
NA,"position of affairs. But, determined to",16
NA,"ignore facts, and resolved on winning the",16
NA,"elections somehow or anyhow, the Labour",16
NA,party went to the people merrily and said,16
NA,that no changes need be made. At the,16
NA,Premiers Conference in May of last,16
NA,"There- year, Mr Bruce reviewed the public",16
NA,"finance of Australia, setting forth the",16
NA,deficits in _ Commonwealth and State,16
NA,budgets. J i t said that an increase of,16
NA,taxation would probably defeat its owu,16
NA,object. Has this Government yet learnt,16
NA,that lesson? The budget introduced in,16
NA,July last proposed increases of taxatior.,16
NA,"amounting to £12,f>50,000; and we now",16
NA,"have before us the admission that, i f",16
NA,that budget be adhered to for the re-,16
NA,"mainder of the year, the deficit on the",16
NA,operations of the year may be between,16
NA,"£1.2,000,000 and £15,000,000.",16
NA,Mr Bruce also pointed out that there,16
NA,"had been. a. fall in the prices of wool,",16
NA,wheat and metals; that wo had less,16
NA,"income to spend, and that consequently we",16
NA,would have to be content with less. I t,16
NA,was not a question of anybody wanting,16
NA,"to take less. So far, the Government has",16
NA,hardly recognized the diminution of,16
NA,"national income, although it has given",16
NA,bore expression to if in both the last and,16
NA,the present financial statement.,16
NA,I t was pointed out by Mr Bruce,17
NA,if we were to have a chance of maintainhappens,17
NA,"ing our standard of living, it was essential",17
NA,that we should reduce the cost of,17
NA,duction. That is still the position,17
NA,"Australia; we have to recognize it,",17
NA,the people have to appreciate it i f proswages,17
NA,perity is to return.,17
NA,"I t was pointed out, further, that",17
NA,expenditure could not continue upon the,17
NA,"then existing scale, but had to",17
NA,"reduced. Mr Bruce said that, unless the country.",17
NA,"this position was faced, unless",17
NA,economic facts were recognized and policy,17
NA,was ordered in accordance with the,17
NA,"factors governing the situation, the",17
NA,native was a diminution of our national,17
NA,wealth and an increase of unemploybelieve,17
NA,"ment until, faeed with a national crisis,",17
NA,we would be forced to lower our standard tics can ensure high wages.,17
NA,of living and readjust the whole of,17
NA,"national life. I t was pointed out, both",17
NA,in this House and at the Premiers',17
NA,"ference, that certain steps would have",17
NA,be taken to deal with the position. I,17
NA,was because of the steps that the last,17
NA,Government proposed to take that the,17
NA,wonderful party which now sits opposite,17
NA,had its glorious victory at the elections,17
NA,"held in October, 1929.",17
NA,"I t was pointed out last year that,",17
NA,the country were placed on a sound read a very short extract. He said-,17
NA,"economic basis, our standard of living",17
NA,"would be threatened, and eventually would",17
NA,decline. Wheu the national income any,17
NA,becomes less-an d it is becoming less-,17
NA,we have all to take less; that appears to action.,17
NA,me to be simply a m'atter of arithmetical,17
NA,calculation.,17
NA,These propositions were quite untruly,17
NA,represented as advocacy of the reduction,17
NA,of wages. Every honorable member of,17
NA,"this House, I believe, wants wages to",17
NA,as high as possible. But if sufficient,17
NA,money is not available there ' cannot,17
NA,the same national dividend as has hitherto,17
NA,been enjoyed. The last Government made,17
NA,certain proposals with respect to the,17
NA,reduction of expenditure inthe Publio,17
NA,Service. Every honorable member,17
NA,opposite who then sat on this side of the,17
NA,"House, and I think I am fairly safe in",17
NA,saying all of those opposite who are newly,17
NA,"in this House, loudly proclaimed that",17
NA,those who how sit on this - side were,17
NA,attacking the allowances of public happen to have reached.,17
NA,servants. Apparently they are still per-,17
NA,sisting with the old idea that standards,17
NA,Mr Latham.,17
NA,"tbat, can be maintained at any rate which",17
NA,"to have been reached, irrespective",17
NA,of whether or not there is enough,17
NA,promoney to meet the requirements of,17
NA,ID the situation. During the election cam-,17
NA,and paign the Labour party contended that,17
NA,bore no relation to economic facts;,17
NA,that they were to be maintained what-,17
NA,"loan ever happened, and that they should be",17
NA,fixed as a matter o f . political policy,17
NA,be independent of the prosperity of,17
NA,Until our people learn,17
NA,the that such a policy is both impos-,17
NA,"sible and. absurd, the affairs of this",17
NA,country will never be placed on a sound,17
NA,alterbasis. The Labour party has induced a,17
NA,large number of people in Australia to,17
NA,that they can procure anything,17
NA,"they want by voting for it, and that poli-",17
NA,The last,17
NA,"our federal election, and the recent New",17
NA,"South Wales election, are perfect demon-",17
NA,Constrations of the acceptance of those,17
NA,to absurd propositions by a considerable,17
NA,t proportion of the population of Australia.,17
NA,We have to discard those propositions.,17
NA,"Recently, Mr Winston Churchill, who",17
NA,"always writes and speaks interestingly,",17
NA,"delivered at Oxford an address on ""Par-",17
NA,liamentary Government and the Econo-,17
NA,"unless mic Problem "", from which I propose to",17
NA,;,17
NA,"I t must be observed that economic problems,",17
NA,"unlike political issues, cannot be solved by",17
NA,"expression, however vehement, of the",17
NA,"national w i l l , but only by taking the right",17
NA,You cannot cure cancer by a majority.,17
NA,What is wanted is a remedy.,17
NA,That is what we in Australia have to,17
NA,learn to-day; we must recognize that,17
NA,there are economic limits to political,17
NA,action. I am not suggesting that we are,17
NA,be unable to produce economic effects and,17
NA,consequences by political action; but I,17
NA,be do say that there are certain economic,17
NA,conditions which constitute limits to poli-,17
NA,"tical action, and that we are in the",17
NA,presence of some of those limits at the,17
NA,"present time. The Labour party, how-",17
NA,"ever, stands for the denial of these intelli-",17
NA,"gent and intelligible principles, and for",17
NA,"the affirmation of the principle that, irre-",17
NA,"spective of the prosperity of the country,",17
NA,wages and salaries and other rewards can,17
NA,be maintained at any figure that they,17
NA,At the last election that party promised,17
NA,"work for all, the maintenance of high",17
NA,"wages, no reduction of Public Service",18
NA,"salaries and allowances, and tbe con-",18
NA,tinuance of the system of Public Service,18
NA,arbitration. Yet it has now wiped out,18
NA,Public Service arbitration. First of all,18
NA,the Government got together representa-,18
NA,"tives of the unions, and told them",18
NA,that if they applied to the Public,18
NA,Service Arbitrator i t had not the,18
NA,money with which to pay substantial,18
NA,"increases, and that, therefore, it was of",18
NA,no use for them to go to the arbitrator.,18
NA,Then the Public Service Arbitrator,18
NA,"retired from his position, his period of",18
NA,appointment having expired. There is no,18
NA,Public Service Arbitrator at the present,18
NA,"time, and Public Service arbitration has",18
NA,"been abolished by the Labour party itself,",18
NA,notwithstanding the fact that at the last,18
NA,election it secured thousands of votes by,18
NA,promising to maintain the system and by,18
NA,falsely representing that the then Govern-,18
NA,ment proposed to abolish it.,18
NA,What has happened in and to Australia,18
NA,in one short year of Labour rule? I have,18
NA,already said that it has been a year of,18
NA,almost unmitigated disaster. I use the,18
NA,"word "" almost"" because I think that the",18
NA,result will be to convince the people-,18
NA,"indeed, they are becoming convinced day",18
NA,by day-tha t the rainbows held before,18
NA,them iu the dim distance by the Labour,18
NA,party are unreal and can never be made,18
NA,real by Labour policies. Let us,18
NA,examine what has happened to this coun-,18
NA,try which has now suffered under,18
NA,a Federal Labour Government for,18
NA,twelve months - I f there was one thing,18
NA,about which the Labour party professed,18
NA,"concern, it was unemployment, and",18
NA,when in opposition it charged the,18
NA,Government of the day with being,18
NA,-responsible for all the unemployment that,18
NA,-existed.,18

NA,who believe that. I shall not follow the,18
NA,-example of the honorable member who,18
NA,interjected by charging the present Go-,18
NA,vernment with being responsible for all,18
NA,the unemployment that at present exists.,18
NA,"I t is true, however, that unemployment",18
NA,has increased .during the regime of this,18
NA,"Labour Government from 12.1 per cent,",18
NA,to the terrible total of 20.5 per cent. The,18
NA,Labour Government promised work for,18
NA,"all, and yet, after one year of office, one-",18
NA,fifth of the registered trade unionists of,18
NA,Australia are out of work. The reduc-,18
NA,tion of wages spread over the whole body,18
NA,of workers has been a great deal more,18
NA,than '20 per cent. Rationing of employ-,18
NA,ment is only another form of unemploy-,18
NA,"ment, a humanitarian variation. I f we",18
NA,consider the rationing figures in con-,18
NA,junction with the unemployment,18
NA,"figures, we arrive at a truly stag-",18
NA,"gering total, and this condition",18
NA,of affairs has come about during the,18
NA,regime of a government which promised,18
NA,the electors iu its circulars and speeches,18
NA,that it would find a solution for the un-,18
NA,employment problem. As a matter of,18
NA,"fact, unemployment is worse now than it",18
NA,ha3 ever been before within the memory,18
NA,"of any one present. On this ground alone,",18
NA,"apart from anything else, the Govern-",18
NA,"ment has lost the confidence of the people,",18
NA,and even of those supporting it. I t has,18
NA,shown that it made false promises in this,18
NA,House. I t made promises which it cannot,18
NA,"now carry out, and which it is making",18
NA,no attempt to carry out.,18
NA,Let us turn now from the subject of,18
NA,unemployment to that of credit. The,18
NA,credit of Australia is lower to-day than it,18
NA,has ever been before in the history of the,18
NA,Oommonwealth. That has been achieved,18
NA,during twelve months of Labour govern-,18
NA,ment.,18
Mr MARTENS ,Th e Leader of the,18
NA,Opposition and his party have themselves,18
NA,done much to injure the country's credit.,18
NA,"They are always crying "" stinking fish "".",18
Mr LATHAM ,Evidentl y the honor-,18
NA,able member-would have us refrain from,18
NA,"stating the truth. Australia's credit,",18
NA,measured by the London price of Oom-,18
NA,"monwealth bonds, the criterion adopted",18
NA,by the present Prime Minister and the,18
NA,". Acting Treasurer, declined from the very",18
NA,day that this Government took office. The,18
NA,constitution of the Government was such,18
NA,as to make it impossible for it to com-,18
NA,mand the confidence of sensible and,18
NA,"responsible people, and so the price of",18
NA,bonds went down. For several years,18
NA,before the last election their price,18
NA,"had been from 1 to 4 or 5 per cent, below",18
NA,"that of New Zealand bonds, but in July",18
NA,"last the price fell to 15.$ per cent, below.",18
NA,And the Treasurer informed us the other,18
NA,day that the London price for £100 Aus-,18
NA,"tralian bonds was £75 5s., a decline of",18
NA,"something i n the region of 25 per eent.,",19
NA,as compared with New Zealand bonds.,19
NA,There is no confidence i n the present,19
NA,"Government, no confidence either i n Aus-",19
NA,"tralia or anywhere else, i n its wisdom or",19
NA,in its fairness. A l l the facts point i n that,19
NA,"direction. Every criterion we can adopt,",19
NA,"every standard we can apply, indicates",19
NA,tlie same thing.,19
NA,The difficulties arising f r o m this,19
NA,general lack of confidence have been,19
NA,aggravated by recent decisions of the,19
NA,Labour caucus to which publicity has,19
NA,somehow been given. Only the other day,19
NA,there was published a resolution which,19
NA,apparently emerged f r o m a body of men,19
NA,who regard themselves as responsible and,19
NA,intelligent. I t was couched i n these,19
NA,terms-,19
NA,That the Commonwealth Bank be required to,19
NA,"create sufficient credit, as and when required,",19
NA,for tiie following purposes:-,19
NA,[a) Finance the requirements,19
NA,Couunonwealth Government in connexion,19
NA,"all services covered by Parliamentary appropriaafraid,",19
NA,tions.,19
NA,(Zi) Meet that proportion of internal loans,19
NA,maturing during the financial year,19
NA,not otherwise been provided for.,19
NA,"That is, £27,000,000 before the end of this",19
NA,"year, and £76,000,000 before the end of",19
NA,next year.,19
Mr MAXWELL , I s that authentic?,19
Mr LATHAM , I understand that i t,19
NA,is. The report has never been challenged.,19
NA,The resolution continues-,19
NA,(c) Provide for financing State and,19
NA,Commonwealth loan works programme up to a,19
NA,"limit of £20,000,000.",19
NA,(rf) Provide financial,19
NA,"through the Commonwealth Bank, trading",19
NA,"banks, State financial institutions and, if",19
NA,".necessary, through insurance companies, to be",19
NA,used for productive purposes in primary and,19
NA,secondary industries.,19
NA,Evidently there w i l l be money to throw,19
NA,"away, money f o r any one who w i l l take",19
NA,i t. There is to be no l i m i t except that',19
NA,"not more than 5 per cent, is to be charged",19
NA,"for the money. I f we add £65,000,000-",19
NA,the amount of parliamentary appropria-,19
NA,"tions-t o the £76,000,000 and that total to",19
NA,"the further £20,000,000, and tack on to",19
NA,that the unlimited amount of financial,19
NA,"accommodation -which is to be provided,",19
NA,we have some measure of the inflation,19
NA,"which this resolution contemplates. ""What",19
NA,government is going to impose unpleasant,19
NA,taxes when i t has a warrant merely to,19
NA,print notes? I t is much easier to print,19
NA,notes than to collect taxes. What govern-,19
NA,ment is going to borrow money or,19
NA,what person will lend money to,19
NA,the Government when the Government,19
NA,can provide fo r loan works as,19
NA,well as for ordinary services simply,19
NA,by creating credit through the issue of,19
NA,"notes ? These proposals would involve, i f",19
NA,"they were put into operation, the robbery",19
NA,of every citizen who has a Savings Bank,19
NA,deposit or an insurance policy; the,19
NA,"robbery and r u i n of wage-earners, and,",19
NA,"indeed, exactly what the Prime Minister",19
NA,"( Mr Scullin), before he lef t Australia,",19
NA,said they would involve-increase d unem-,19
NA,"ployment up to 1,000,000 persons instead",19
NA,"of something over 250,000 persons.",19
NA,Then we have another contribution to,19
NA,the establishment and maintenance of,19
NA,confidence i n the Commonwealth! I t is a,19
NA,resolution proposed by the honorable,19
NA,"of tlie member f o r Bourke ( Mr Anstey), the",19
NA,"with Minister for Health-bu t not, I am",19
NA,of financial health-i n the present,19
NA,"Ministry. This resolution, carried only",19
NA,"which has the other day, is as follows:-",19
NA,That legislation be passed immediately com-,19
NA,"pelling bondholders in the £27,000,000 loan",19
NA,"maturing i n December, to hold their bonds for",19
NA,"a further period of twelve months, interest",19
NA,"to be paid as usual, with the proviso that",19
NA,persons in necessitous circumstances may re-,19
NA,ceive immediate payment of small amounts,19
NA,by cashing thbir bonds at the Commonwealth,19
NA,"Bank, the same to be held as non-interest-bear-",19
NA,"ing security, the onus of proving that the",19
NA,"circumstances j u s t i f y payment, to f a l l on the",19
NA,bondholders.,19
NA,I presume that honorable members,19
NA,accommodation opposite who voted f o r that motion,19
NA,believed i n i t . I am prepared to give,19
NA,them credit f o r sincerity i f not f o r intel-,19
NA,ligenceof a high order. This is another,19
NA,"proposal f o r inflation, and inflation",19
NA,involves repudiation. I f that motion were,19
NA,carried into effect a man who had lent,19
NA,the Commonwealth money i n good faith,19
NA,"on the credit of the nation, and received",19
NA,in return f o r i t a bond containing a,19
NA,"promise to pay, might be told when, i n",19
NA,"due course, he came along to get his bond",19
NA,"cashed: "" Oh, we w i l l give you another",19
NA,"promise to pay i n twelve months "" . O f",19
NA,what use is such a promise after the first,19
NA,has been dishonored?,19
NA,I t has been left to the Labour party,19
NA,to give these shocks to the confidence of,19
NA,the public i n Australia and beyond our,19
NA,own boundaries. A fte r only twelve,19
NA,months i i i office tho Labour party has,20
NA,hauled down the Australian flag and,20
NA,dragged it in the mud. This is the first,20
NA,British dominion in which any respon-,20
NA,sible political party has ever advocated,20
NA,repudiation. For the first time in history,20
NA,"a British Minister, speaking from the",20
NA,same platform as an Australian Prime,20
NA,"Minister, has thought it necessary to pay",20
NA,"the latter the compliment of saying, in",20
NA,"tones of mingled admiration and surprise,",20
NA,"tliat he, at least, is an honest and honor-",20
NA,able man-a s I believe he is. The com-,20
NA,parison between the Prime Minister and,20
NA,some members of the party which he is,20
NA,understood to lead is obvious. I t has been,20
NA,left to the Labour party to bring about,20
NA,the present condition of affairs by pro-,20
NA,posing public and calculated dishonesty,20
NA,for the first time in the history of a,20
NA,British dominion.,20
Mr SPEAKER ,Order ! The honor-,20
NA,able gentleman is out of order in speak-,20
NA,ing of any action of members of this this,20
NA,"House as ""calculated dishonesty"".",20
Mr LATHAM , I withdraw the statea,20
NA,ment. Enterprise is nearly dead in AusThis,20
NA,tralia. This Government had nearly killed,20
NA,it when the New South Wales elections internal,20
NA,came and gave it almost the finishing,20
NA,"Mow. The unemployment which is ramexpenditure,",20
NA,pant has been created largely by this,20
NA,"Government, or has resulted from",20
NA,of confidence which this Government has,20
NA,"engendered by its policy, or absence",20
NA,"policy; by its vacillation, hesitation",20
NA,delay.,20
NA,We now have before us the Acting,20
NA,Treasurer's financial statement. Every ledge,20
NA,one who reads i t must observe that it,20
NA,"divided into two parts, the second part",20
NA,of which by no means fits the first part.,20
NA,Throughout the second part of the statethey,20
NA,"ment the marks of compromise, and",20
NA,"unsatisfactory compromise at that, are",20
NA,apparent. The first part of the statement,20
NA,evidently stands as it was originally pre-,20
NA,"pared, and i t is sound. I .congratulate",20
NA,the Government upon possessing some,20
NA,members who are trying to do things,20
NA,sound and honorable lines. But,20
NA,what is being done in that direction is,20
NA,"being done too late, and not enough of",20
NA,it is being done. I f the Government,20
NA,faced its difficulties earlier some of,20
NA,troubles which now loom before us would,20
NA,never have occurred.,20
NA,I n the first part of his statement the,20
NA,Acting Treasurer has a good deal to say,20
NA,about the present general financial posi-,20
NA,tion of Australia. I agree with practi-,20
NA,cally every word of that part of the state-,20
NA,ment. The honorable gentleman has,20
NA,reminded us that in June last the then,20
NA,Treasurer said that it was essential that,20
NA,the budgets of the Commonwealth aud,20
NA,the States should be balanced in the forth-,20
NA,coming financial year. He then reminded,20
NA,us that in his budget speech last July,20
NA,the Prime Minister and Treasurer said,20
NA,that no further drift in the Common-,20
NA,wealth finances could be permitted.,20
NA,But what has happened during the,20
NA,last three or four months? Noth-,20
NA,ing but drift and delay. The Acting,20
NA,Treasurer went on to quote the following,20
NA,resolution which the Premiers Conference,20
NA,adopted in Melbourne on the 21st,20
NA,August:-,20
NA,That the several governments represented at,20
NA,conference declare their fixed determina-,20
NA,tion to balance their respective budgets for,20
NA,the financial year 1930-31. and to maintain,20
NA,similar balanced budget i n future years.,20
NA,budget equilibrium w i l l be maintained on,20
NA,such a basis as is consistent with the repay-,20
NA,ment or conversion in Australia of existing,20
NA,debt maturing in the next few years.,20
NA,"Further, if during any financial year there",20
NA,are indications of a failure of revenue to meet,20
NA,immediate further steps w i l l be,20
NA,taken during the year to ensure that the,20
NA,the lack budgets shall balance.,20
NA,The Commonwealth representatives,20
NA,of at the conference voted for that,20
NA,"and motion because, no doubt, it was",20
NA,regarded as sound. I presume that the,20
NA,motion was agreed to with a f u l l know-,20
NA,of all the facts. I n the light of that,20
NA,is knowledge the Commonwealth and State,20
NA,Governments agreed to balance their bud-,20
NA,gets this year. They did not consider that,20
NA,were agreeing to an impossibility;,20
NA,but it may be that this Government has,20
NA,created a partial impossibility by their,20
NA,delay in giving effect to the resolution.,20
NA,The Acting Treasurer mentioned in,20
NA,his statement that the deficit in the Com-,20
NA,monwealth accounts for the quarter ended,20
NA,ou 31st September last was no less than,20
NA,"even £6,747,000. That sum is about equal to",20
NA,the accumulated deficit for the past three,20
NA,years. I t was rightly pointed out that,20
NA,had those figures could not be regarded,20
NA,the as a fair measure to be applied to the,20
NA,whole financial year; but the Acting,20
NA,Treasurer went on to say that a deficit of,20
NA,"anything from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000",21
NA,might result from the year's operations,21
NA,unless changes were made. The figures,21
NA,published subsequently for October,21
NA,duced the deficit in the accounts,21
NA,"£5,900,000. I t appears from the Acting",21
NA,Treasurer's statement that a deficit,21
NA,"£9,000,000 may occur in the estimated",21
NA,customs revenue during the year. That,21
NA,exactly what the Opposition said would,21
NA,"occur, but the opinion was received",21
NA,laughter by honorable members opposite.,21
NA,The sales tax - may return about,21
NA,"£1,000,000 less than was anticipated.",21
- Mr LEWIS ,Th e Prime Minister said,21
NA,that that might be so.,21
Mr LATHAM ,Th e Prime Minister,21
NA,said that he intended to balance the,21
NA,"get, and i f the honorable member",21
NA,Corio will take the trouble to read,21
NA,-right honorable gentleman's remarks durtralian,21
NA,ing the budget debate and the debate,21
NA,the sales tax measures and the Approway,21
NA,priation Bill he will find that my statebeen,21
NA,ment is correct. The Opposition,21
NA,"lenged the Government's figures, in regard",21
NA,"to both revenue and expenditure, and",21
NA,events have thoroughly justified the chala,21
NA,lenge. While the sales tax may return,21
NA,"to the Treasury about £1,000,000 less",21
NA,"was anticipated, there is likely to be",21
NA,increase in pensions expenditure of,21
NA,"£400,000.",21
Mr LEWIS ,Th e Leader of the Opposi-,21
NA,tion should read the Prime Miuister's,21
NA,speech.,21
Mr LATHAM ,Th e honorable memportion,21
NA,ber for Corio apparently does not appreless,21
NA,ciate the fact that the budget figures,21
NA,- the Prime Minister balanced; yet we,21
NA,now told by the Acting Treasurer,21
NA,that unless there is a restoration of,21
NA,fidence and a revival of trade and employThe,21
NA,ment there will be a deficit of between,21
NA,"£12,000,000 and £15,000,000 this year,",21
NA,and with the restoration of confidence,21
NA,the revival of trade a deficit of between,21
NA,"£8,000,000 and £10,000,000. Parliament",21
NA,has been called together again because,21
NA,the Government had not enough sense,21
NA,act on the advice given by this side,21
NA,the House in July last.,21
NA,The London position is serious,21
NA,"There, an amount of £38,000,000 is",21
NA,"outstanding. The Treasurer, in",21
NA,"budget speech in July, said that the",21
NA,tence of this overdraft was likely to prove,21
NA,' seriously embarrassing. The position is,21
NA,worse now ; yet the Acting Treasurer has,21
NA,given the House no information as to,21
NA,rewhether any steps are being or can be,21
NA,to taken in accordance with the amended,21
NA,budget proposals to remedy it. I f the,21
NA,of problem had been tackled in August the,21
NA,aifficulty would not have arisen. Had,21
NA,is the Government immediately set to work,21
NA,"to reduce expenditure by £4,000,000 the",21
NA,with London debt would have been funded,21
NA,"readily ere this, with the result that about",21
NA,"£20,000,000 would have been released by",21
NA,the Commonwealth Bank. According to,21
NA,"the Acting Treasurer's statement, over-",21
NA,drafts and advances due to the Common-,21
NA,wealth Bank in London amount to about,21
NA,"bud- £20,000,000. I f that debt had been",21
NA,"for funded a corresponding amount would,",21
NA,the have been available for financing Aus-,21
NA,public works and industries. That,21
NA,on would have been a proper and honorable,21
NA,"of releasing credit, and could have",21
NA,utilized had the Government acted,21
NA,chalpromptly as it promised to do.,21
NA,"The Acting Treasurer, after showing",21
NA,net short-term indebtedness in Australia,21
NA,"of £7,134,000, dealt with the banking",21
NA,than position and showed that the banks have,21
NA,an strained their resources to the limit in,21
NA,about order to finance Australian industry.,21
NA,According to the statistics quoted by the,21
NA,Acting Treasurer the proportion of,21
NA,.advances to deposits was 95 per eent;,21
NA,"adding Government securities, which are",21
NA,"really loans to the Government, the pro-",21
NA,of advances to deposits is not,21
NA,than 105 per cent. I n the light of,21
NA,of those figures nobody can truthfully say,21
NA,are that the Commonwealth and trading banks,21
NA,are not doing their utmost to finance,21
NA,conthe present requirements of Australia.,21
NA,"national income, the Acting Treas-",21
NA,"urer stated, has dropped since last year",21
NA,"by £70,000,000, representing the decrease",21
NA,"and in the prices of wool, wheat, and metals,",21
NA,and the smaller amount of money coming,21
NA,into Australia through external borrow-,21
NA,ing. This estimate leaves out of account,21
NA,to the annual turnover of income. Every,21
NA,of £1 received by the farmer for his wheat,21
NA,becomes part of the income of the store-,21
NA,"keeper and merchant in that year, and we",21
NA,indeed. can safely say that the national,21
NA,"still income was between £100,000,000 and",21
NA,"his £150,000,000 lower than it was in the",21
NA,exisprevious year. Now we are told that in,21
NA,tlie immediate future the income f r o m,22
NA,wool and wheat w i l l be even less-,22
NA,"Wool is now averaging about 9d. per lb.,",22
NA,compared with Is. 3d. for the clip of last year,22
NA,"and Is. 7d. for the clip of the previous year,",22
NA,and the price of wheat f.o.b. Australia is less,22
NA,"than 3s. a bushel, as compared with about",22
NA,5s. a bushel last year.,22
NA,Inevitably there w i l l be a further serious,22
NA,decline i n the national income. I n those,22
NA,circumstances the Melbourne agreement,22
NA,between the Commonwealth and the,22
NA,representatives of the States was made,22
NA,"and the Premiers subscribed to i t , trustbetter,",22
NA,ing i n the good f a i t h of the Commontheir adequacy.,22
NA,wealth Government. According to the,22
NA,official report of the conference the Acting,22
NA,Prime Minister stated-,22
NA,The Federal Cabinet had also agreed that,22
NA,"the budget shall be balanced this year,",22
NA,"the position will be watched carefully,",22
NA,that steps will be taken at the earliest moment,22
NA,"necessary to adjust the position; firstly,",22
NA,"reduction in expenditure, and secondly, any other savings"".",22
NA,adjustment of taxation required to be made,22
NA,so as not to encroach on tbe State field,22
NA,taxation.,22
NA,The proposals contained i n the second,22
NA,half of the Acting Treasurer's financial,22
NA,statement last week do not honour the,22
NA,terms of the agreement. Honorable,22
NA,members w i l l find a complete change of,22
NA,"matter, and almost of tone, in the Acting",22
NA,Treasurer's statement commencing at,22
NA,""" Expenditure proposals "" . The honor-",22
NA,able gentleman had earlier said-,22
NA,At the Premiers' Conference the,22
NA,Minister announced that any necessary important issue.,22
NA,revision of the budget would provide firstly,22
NA,for a reduction of expenditure and that,22
NA,justments of taxation would not encroach on vides-,22
NA,the State fields of taxation. The proposals,22
NA,now submitted are as far as practicable in,22
NA,keeping with this declaration.,22
NA,I propose to examine the proposals with,22
NA,a view to discovering whether they are i n,22
NA,keeping w i th the Prime Minister's,22
NA,declaration. I suggest that at this point,22
NA,in the Acting Treasurer's speech common,22
NA,"sense ended and compromise began. "" The",22
NA,honorable gentleman's proposals follow a,22
NA,statement made by the Acting Prime,22
NA,Minister ( Mr Fenton) on the 3rd,22
NA,October after a meeting of Cabinet-,22
NA,Cabinet has discussed the whole financial,22
NA,position. The proposals to balance the budget portions - of the -' act.,22
NA,submitted by the sub-committee were,22
NA,"cussed and .approved substantially as presented,",22
NA,f t was agreed that expenditure might be re-,22
NA,"duced at the rate of approximately £4,000,000",22
NA,per annum.,22
NA,The honorable gentleman went on to say,22
NA,that Parliament would assemble on t h *,22
NA,"30th October, and that the Parliamentary",22
NA,Labour party would meet on the 27 th,22
NA,October. I t is obvious that the party,22
NA,"overruled the Government, f o r the Acting",22
NA,"Treasurer ( Mr Lyons) is proposing, not",22
NA,a reduction of expenditure at the rate of,22
NA,"£4,000,000 per annum, but what purports",22
NA,to be a reduction at the rate of slightly,22
NA,"more than £3,000,000 per annum. The",22
NA,Government's proposals may have to be,22
NA,accepted in the absence of something,22
NA,but we are entitled to examine,22
NA,The Acting Treasurer mentioned,22
NA,various proposed savings on the Estimates,22
NA,"amounting to £1,230,000, but no infor-",22
NA,that mation is given as to how these figures,22
NA,"and are arrived at. For instance, we are not",22
NA,"told how £375,000 is to be saved i n respect",22
NA,"by a of "" miscellaneous works and services and",22
NA,There is nothing to,22
NA,"of indicate the nature of the savings, and",22
NA,"whether, in fact, they can be realized.",22
NA,The Acting Treasurer proposes also to,22
NA,apply to the expenditure of the year,22
NA,"£1,950,000 of amounts that rightly",22
NA,belong to the sinking fund . This cannot,22
NA,be claimed as a reduction i n expenditure;,22
NA,it is merely a device to enable the,22
NA,Government to continue living on sub-,22
NA,stantially the same scale and to avoid,22
NA,providing f o r the redemption of the,22
NA,public debt. The proposed raid upon the,22
NA,Prime sinking fund raises a difficult and,22
NA,Section 9 of the,22
NA,adNational Debt Sinking Fund Act pro-,22
NA,(1) The Treasurer shall pay into the,22
NA,"Trust Fund, under the heading of",22
NA,the National Debt Sinking Fund-,22
NA,(g) All moneys received in respect of,22
NA,reparations under the Treaty of,22
NA,Peace with Germany.,22

NA,wealth Sank of Australia on or,22
NA,"after the 1st day of July, One",22
NA,thousand nine hundred and twenty-,22
NA,"three, shall be paid to the National",22
NA,Debt Sinking Fund.,22
NA,The Government proposes to repeal those,22
NA,Commonwealth,22
NA,disloans are issued on the basis of pros-,22
NA,pectuses upon the bona fides of which,22
NA,members of the puhlic are invited to lend,22
NA,their money to the Oommonwealth. The,22
NA,prospectuses vary. One issued by,23
NA,Oommonwealth Bank in London on the,23
NA,"1.6th January, 1929, stated-",23
NA,All Commonwealth loans carry si. sinking,23
NA,fund in accordance with the provision,23
NA,National Debt Sinking Fund Act which pro-,23
NA,"vides, inter alia, that a sum equal to",23
NA,"por cent, shall he provided each financial",23
NA,That is an undertaking that payment,23
NA,will be made to the sinking fund us,23
NA,provided by Commonwealth legislation.,23
NA,Another prospectus issued in London,23
NA,"May, 1929, stated-",23
NA,All Commonwealth loans carry a sinking,23
NA,fund in accordance with the provisions,23
NA,National Debt Sinking Fund Acts.,23
NA,I n that instance there is no limitation,23
NA,of 10s. per cent. Tho final illustration,23
NA,I quote is a prospectus issued by the,23
NA,present Government in Australia on the,23
NA,"3rd February, 1930. paragraph 10",23
NA,which states-,23
NA,Sinking fund contributions will be paid,23
NA,the National Debt Sinking Fund in accordance,23
NA,with the requirements of the Commonwealth,23
NA,law.,23
NA,That does uot mean Commonwealth law,23
NA,as altered from time to time at the will,23
NA,"of Parliament; if it did, the paragraph",23
NA,"would be farcical, deceptive, and valueless.",23
NA,I fear that the proposal to repeal portions,23
NA,of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act,23
NA,will have a very disadvantageous effect,23
NA,upon Australian credit. Obviously,23
NA,without breach of faith Parliament can,23
NA,repeal paragraph g and sub-section,23
NA,it can repeal all the provisions until no Commonwealth.,23
NA,security in the form of a sinking fund,23
NA,"left, except the financial agreement as",23
NA,applies to loans floated iu behalf of,23
NA,"States. Then, in addition to these alleged",23
NA,savings there are proposals for increased,23
NA,"taxation by way of customs and excise,",23
NA,but I doubt very much whether the result,23
NA,will be to add to the revenue at all. Take,23
NA,for example the increased excise on,23
NA,tobacco. In Melbourne tobacco is to-day,23
NA,"selling cheaply, because of a tobacco war,",23
NA,but when the effect of an increase in excise come taxation.,23
NA,"to 9s. or 9s. 3d. is. realized, the",23
NA,price of tobacco must increase subprovide,23
NA,stantially and its consumption fall wage.,23
NA,appreciably. It is doubtful whether the,23
NA,estimates of the Acting Treasurer will be,23
NA,realized in any of their particulars.,23
NA,do not propose to examine in detail the,23
NA,"customs and excise provisions, but I say.",23
NA,Mr Ijatham.,23
NA,"the as .1. said in August last in this House,",23
NA,that .1. cannot 3ee that they will bring,23
NA,in the estimated revenue.,23
NA,.1. now come to the income tax pro-,23
NA,of the visions. We have before ussome most,23
NA,10s. remarkably discriminatory proposals-,23
NA,"year. proposals which, I venture to say, are",23
NA,most scandalously unjust. The exemption,23
NA,in the case of income from property is to,23
NA,be reduced to £ 100. An alteration is being,23
NA,made in the rate of tax on income from,23
NA,in personal exertion and property. I have,23
NA,with me some estimates showing the effect,23
NA,in Victoria of these changes. Take an,23
NA,of the income of £400 a. year from personal,23
NA,exertion. Last financial year the State,23
NA,and Federal income tax paid in such a,23
NA,case was £6 4s.; this year it will be £13 2s.,23
NA,Now take the same income earned from,23
NA,property in Victoria. Last year the in-,23
NA,come tax paid to the State and the Com-,23
NA,of monwealth was £10 10s.; this year it,23
NA,will be £56 6s. I n the case of an income,23
NA,"into of £500 from personal exertion, ihe in-",23
NA,crease in taxation is from £11 10s. to,23
NA,"£20 5s., but on the income from property",23
NA,the tax is increased from £18 8s. to,23
NA,£'74 5s. An income of £200 is to be,23
NA,exempt from taxation i f earned by way of,23
NA,"personal exertion, but i f derived from",23
NA,property in the way of rents from a,23
NA,"cottage or two, or interest, on money",23
NA,earned as a result of thrift and saved,23
NA,"over many year3, the tax is to be £21 14s.",23
NA,if The fixing of this low exemption in the,23
NA,"case of property income is most unjust,",23
NA,"2, and will impose hardship all over the",23
NA,Many Australians-,23
NA,is we probably all know some of them-hav e,23
NA,it a strong sense of personal pride and in-,23
NA,"the dependence, and have saved through-",23
NA,out their lives in. order that in their de-,23
NA,clining years they may be independent of,23
NA,the old-age pension. I am glad to say,23
NA,"that there are thousands of these citizens,",23
NA,"yet they are to be hit by this tax, and",23
NA,brought down below the living wage. I,23
NA,do appeal to the Government to re-,23
NA,consider this unjust proposal to alter in-,23
Dr MALONEY ,I t would be fair to,23
NA,for no reduction below the basic,23
Mr LATHAM ,Ther e should be some,23
NA,substantial alteration. I t is a mistake to,23
NA,I think that income from property repre-,23
NA,sents the income of a lot of millionaires.,23
NA,One has only to look at the shareholders,23
NA,"lists of banks and trading companies, and",24
NA,at tbe lists of bondholders i n Common-,24
NA,"wealth and State loans, savings bank",24
NA,"loans, Board of Works loans and the",24
NA,"like, to realize that there are a large",24
NA,number of very thrifty people in Aus-,24
NA,tralia. The best indication of that is the,24
NA,deposits in the savings banks. There are,24
NA,"some 4,000,000 depositors in the savings",24
NA,"banks of Australia, including, of course, a",24
NA,large number of children -who are learn-,24
NA,ing thrift in their early years. These,24
NA,"citizens, excluding of course, the children,",24
NA,"will be hit, some of them most cruelly by",24
NA,these proposals.,24
NA,"Then, in strong contrast, we come",24
NA,"to the ""proposal of the Govern-",24
NA,ment with respect to the Public Service.,24
NA,"Under this special legislation, every pub-",24
NA,lic servant receiving a. salary of £725 or,24
NA,under is to be exempt from any reduction.,24
NA,The proposed rate of tax on salaries,24
NA,"of between £725 aud £1,000 is 10",24
NA,"per cent., from £1,000 to £1,500",24
NA,"12$ per cent., and above that 15",24
NA,per cent. Let us consider the,24
NA,operation of this tax. The man in receipt,24
NA,"of £725 will lose nothing, but the man in",24
NA,"receipt of £800 will, lose £75. Can there",24
NA,be any justification for such a scheme?,24
NA,This is class taxation of a. most exagger :,24
NA,"uted character. What, reason can there",24
NA,be for drawing the line at £725? I refusf,24
NA,to believe that members of the Public Ser-,24
NA,vice-larg e numbers of whom I know,24
NA,personally-woul d resent a fair all-round,24
NA,proportionate and graded reduction. Their,24
NA,"own self.respect would lead them, at least",24
NA,"those with whom I am acquainted, to",24
NA,accept a reduction of salary in these,24
NA,troublous times. Yet we find this Go-,24
NA,vernment introducing class legislation. I t,24
NA,"says that it is not, reducing salaries. I t ,",24
NA,"of course, would never reduce salaries",24
NA,unless it could be reasonably sure that the,24
NA,people at whom it hits are not its own,24
NA,political supporters. The men in tin?,24
NA,Defence Department who cannot join a,24
NA,"union have had their work rationed, but",24
NA,those who Belong to unions have not been,24
NA,rationed. Only the non-unionist members,24
NA,of the Public Service-som e of whom have,24
NA,applied for admission to unions and have,24
NA,been refused-ar e to have their salaries,24
NA,reduced. This Government refuses to re-,24
NA,duce the salaries of any body of meu who,24
NA,are its own political supporters.,24
NA,This Government promised at the Pre-,24
NA,miers Conference in Melbourne that the,24
NA,budget would be balanced first by the,24
NA,reduction of expenditure.,24
Mr WATKINS ,Wh y did not Mr.,24
NA,Bavin carry out his promise?,24
Mr LATHAM , Mr Bavin was re-,24
NA,sponsible for a reduction of S-l/3rd pei',24
NA,"cent, in public service salaries in New",24
NA,"South Wales. Mr Lang, merely to get",24
NA,"votes, promised to restore those salaries.",24
NA,That was one of the most contemptible,24
NA,"political promises ever made, and I hope",24
NA,that it will be the last example of its,24
NA,"kind. The Labour party, because of its",24
NA,lavish and irresponsible political pro-,24
NA,mises is now being brought up against,24
NA,the inexorable logic of facts. The people,24
NA,are realizing that they have for years,24
NA,"been deceived by the Labour party, that ii",24
NA,has a so-called policy which can only be,24
NA,put into operation when there is plenty,24
NA,of money to spend. I t has no,24
NA,real political principles. The people,24
NA,will doubtless realize this position,24
NA,before Mr Lang has been in power,24
NA,very long. This Federal Government,24
NA,uow proposes that public servants in re-,24
NA,ceipt of over £725 are to suffer a reduc-,24
NA,"tion in salary, but those receiving under",24
NA,£725 are to remain untouched. The,24
NA,hypocritical pretence is being made that,24
NA,"salaries are not being reduced, bur.",24
NA,that a tax is being levied. I n any case,24
NA,the public servant affected is to get less,24
NA,salary. The tax is to be subtracted before,24
NA,he receives his salary. I suppose that,24
NA,there are some honorable members who,24
NA,think that they can deceive themselves,24
NA,by this vain pretence. I t is obviously,24
NA,a hypocritical device to hide the inevitable,24
NA,"reduction of salary. I t is, however,",24
NA,significant that expenditure throughout,24
NA,the Public Service is being maintained,24
NA,substantially a.t its old level of about,24
NA,"£11,000,000'. Mr Hogan, the Labour",24
NA,"Premier of Victora, relying upon",24
NA,"the good, faith of the Federal Govern-",24
NA,ment that i t would also do an. un-,24
NA,"popular thing, is carrying through the",24
NA,Victorian Parliament at the present time a,24
NA,reduction in the salaries of public servants,24
NA,of from 5 to 20 per cent. He is prepared,24
NA,to do an unpopular thing in order to,24
NA,"carry out his word. Unfortunately, this",24
NA,Government is not prepared to keep faith,24
NA,with Mr Hogan. Take the Labour,24
NA,"Premier of South Australia, Mr Hill.",24
NA,.Does any one tliink that he relishes,25
NA,reducing Public Service salaries by 10 per deficit will be much greater.,25
NA,cent.? Not for one moment; yet he is of time granted.],25
NA,doing that. Other State Premiers are,25
NA,doing it too; but I refer particularly to,25
NA,"Labour Premiers, because I should have",25
NA,"thought that this Government would keep extent of at least over £1,000,000.",25
NA,faith with politicians of their own,25
NA,Let me say one further word in respect,25
NA,of this remarkable action of the Governthe,25
NA,ment in drawing a line at salaries of £725,25
NA,per amium. I n answer to a question that,25
NA,F. put to the Acting Prime Minister,25
NA,NA,25
NA,"information to the effect that the numpaper be printed""-",25
NA,ber of permanent employees in the Com-,25
NA,"monwealth Public Service is 28,855; with",25
NA,"temporary and exempt employees, 4,179;",25
NA,"total, 33,034. The members of naval, more",25
NA,"military and air forces number 5,959; of",25
NA,"other employees, 5,459; total, 11,418. bourne.""",25
NA,Combining the Public Service and the,25
NA,"naval, military and air forces, the total",25
NA,number of Commonwealth employees is,25
NA,"over 44,000. I also asked the Acting",25
NA,Prime Minister how many persons in,25
NA,those classes were in receipt of salaries,25
NA,"of £725 and over. The answer is that,",25
NA,"apart from 112 members of Parliament, that-",25
NA,"the number is 491, includiug 50",25
NA,"rationed military omcers, who are outside the",25
NA,of the taxation scheme. That leaves 441,25
NA,"persons, out of some 44,000 government",25
NA,"employees, effected by this taxation, Australia",25
NA,representing -just about 1 per cent. Does arrangements,25
NA,"any honorable member in this House expenditure,",25
NA,believe that this taxation is fair in prinfices,25
NA,ciple or in its results?,25
NA,I conclude by saying that the Governsubstantial,25
NA,ment ought to have carried out the agreesections,25
NA,ment made by the Prime Minister in,25
NA,Melbourne. It. was not a casual agreeceeds-,25
NA,ment; but an agreement made as the,25
NA,result of a special Cabinet meeting held (ices,25
NA,at the Prime Minister's own home. I say,25
NA,first that the Government has not done ing,25
NA,what it promised to do; that other sacrifices,25
NA,"governments are doing unpopular things,-",25
NA,believing that the promise of this,25
NA,ment would be carried out. This Governadopted,25
NA,"ment has, therefore, broken faith with",25
NA,"States. Judging by what it has done, it",25
NA,will certainly fail to balance the budget.,25
NA,"On the Acting Treasurer's own figures,",25
NA,"even if all his anticipations are realized,-",25
NA,"there will be a deficit of over £1,000,000',",25
NA,"and, if his anticipations are not realized,",25
NA,Mr Latham.,25
NA,"as I fear indeed will be the case, the",25
NA,[Extension,25
NA,The Government should not budget for,25
NA,a deficit as it is doing to the admitted,25
NA,I,25
NA,kin. think that the amount will be much,25
NA,greater. The Government may not have,25
NA,the money to meet its obligations. As,25
NA,banking position is strained to the,25
NA,"utmost, the budget must be balanced. The",25
NA,Government's proposals will not result,25
NA,in this being accomplished. I move as,25
NA,"an amendment to the motion "" That the",25
NA,"That all the words after "" T h a t "" be omitted",25
NA,a view to insert in lieu thereof the words,25
NA,""" the Government should introduce proposals",25
NA,closely in accord with the agreement,25
NA,made by the Prime Minister with the Premiers,25
NA,the States on tho 21st August last at Mel-,25
NA,"Difficult as it is, that is the only path to",25
NA,follow. I think it was the Acting Prime,25
NA,Minister who said-r-hi s utterance was,25
NA,assented to by other Commonwealth Min-,25
NA,isters-a s reported on page 11 of the,25
NA,oflicial report of the Melbourne conference,25
NA,The members of tlie conference represent all,25
NA,governments of Australia. Their decisions,25
NA,havo been arrived at apart from party or,25
NA,"political considerations, and with the sole",25
NA,desire to avert the danger which threatens,25
NA,The carrying out of these,25
NA,will unquestionably involve a,25
NA,heavy diminution i n both revenue and loan,25
NA,and w i l l require substantial sacri-,25
NA,ou the part of all sections of the com-,25
NA,munity -,25
NA,Do the Government's proposals involve,25
NA,sacrifices on the part of all,25
NA,of the community? I contend,25
NA,that they do not. The statement pro-,25
NA,But the voluntary acceptance of these sacri;,25
NA,"is, in the opinion of the members of the",25
NA,"conference, the only possible way of avoid-",25
NA,the infinitely greater and more prolonged,25
NA,that would be involved in any failure,25
NA,to meet our national obligations.,25
NA,GovernI am glad that the Government has,25
NA,some of the principles agreed,25
NA,"the upon in August last, and that in par-",25
NA,ticular it has invited Ministers and mem-,25
NA,bers of this House to make a sacrifice in,25
NA,the matter of their allowances. I am also,25
NA,"glad that the Government, in spite of its",25
NA,repudiation of such a proposal only three,25
NA,"months ago, has seen the wisdom of this",25
NA,"action, and has had the good judgment to",26
NA,submit this proposal to the House. The,26
NA,only sure path to follow is that laid down,26
NA,at the Melbourne conference. I t is the,26
NA,path of honour and the only path that,26
NA,will lead us to prosperity.,26
NA,NA,26
NA,I second the amendment moved by the,26
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham).,26
NA,I was not at all surprised at the summons,26
NA,which came to honorable members to meet,26
NA,before Christmas to assist the Govern-,26
NA,ment i n revising its budget proposals. I,26
NA,"was, however, surprised at the delay",26
NA,which occurred between the holding of the,26
NA,financial conference i n Melbourne in,26
NA,"August last, where the Prime Minister",26
NA,"met the State Premiers, and the meeting",26
NA,of Parliament. Three months ago hon-,26
NA,orable members on this side of the,26
NA,chamber urged the Government to,26
NA,reduce its expenditure by at least,26
NA,"£4,000,000 annually; but the mem-",26
NA,bers of the Government and their sup-,26
NA,porters placed a blind eye to the telescope,26
NA,and pretended that they did not see any,26
NA,necessity f o r any reduction i n expendi-,26
NA,tude. I told honorable members at the,26
NA,"time that, although they were trying to",26
NA,"evade their responsibilities, they could not",26
NA,avoid facing the situation f or any length,26
NA,of time. I informed them that as sure as,26
NA,the harvest would ripen the position,26
NA,would have to be faced. We have now,26
NA,"been called together to do something,",26
NA,"inadequate as i t is, before the harvest has",26
NA,ripened. The financial statement pre-,26
NA,sented by the Acting Treasurer ( Mr .,26
NA,Lyons) is a pitiably feeble effort to meet,26
NA,nn unprecedented financial situation. I,26
NA,do not believe that the Acting Treasurer,26
NA,is himself satisfied with i t . I think that i f,26
NA,he had been permitted to have his own,26
NA,way he would have introduced measures,26
NA,more likely to assist i n overcoming our,26
NA,financial difficulties. The reductions which,26
NA,are foreshadowed i n this amended budget,26
NA,are hopelessly insufficient-the y are ludi-,26
NA,crously inadequate. I f i t were necessary,26
NA,s,26
NA,a few months ago to reduce expenditure,26
NA,"by £4,000,000 annually i n order to bring",26
NA,us back to the level of last year's expendi-,26
NA,"ture, i t is of even greater necessity to-day.",26
NA,The steps which the Government pro-,26
NA,"poses to take, represent the last word i n",26
NA,"feebleness and f u t i l i t y , and disclose",26
NA,extent to which the Government has,26
NA,departed f r o m the budget proposals,26
NA,delivered i n July last. How immeasur-,26
NA,ably have they fallen short of the Prime,26
NA,Minister's ( Mr Scullin) words. The,26
NA,"Prime Minister, i n introducing his budget",26
NA,"in July last, said-",26
NA,"Parliament must recognize, however, that",26
NA,no further drift in Commonwealth finances,26
NA,"can be permitted, and that tlie balancing of",26
NA,the budget is an essential step for the restora-,26
NA,tion of the credit of Australia. The Govern-,26
NA,ment proposes to watch the financial position,26
NA,"closely throughout the year, and without",26
NA,waiting until the end of the financial year,26
NA,will not hesitate to take immediate steps if,26
NA,such action appears to be necessary in order,26
NA,to prevent any serious disturbance in the,26
NA,budgetary position.,26
NA,We have not merely the Prime Minis-,26
NA,ter's word; but the Government's,26
NA,decision i n the resolution which i t,26
NA,assisted to carry at the conference of,26
NA,Commonwealth and State Ministers a,26
NA,month later. That resolution read-,26
NA,That the several Governments represented,26
NA,at this conference,26
NA,That is the Melbourne conference,26
NA,declare their fixed determination,26
NA,Their fixed determination! The word,26
NA,""" fixed "" appears to have been entirely for-",26
NA,gotten by the Government. The state-,26
NA,ment continues-,26
NA,to balance their respective budgets for the,26
NA,"financial year 1930-3.1, and to maintain simi-",26
NA,lar balanced budgets in future years.,26
NA,A little further on the report states- -,26
NA,"Further, if, during any financial year there",26
NA,is an indication of a failure of revenue to,26
NA,meet expenditure immediate further steps will,26
NA,be taken during the j'ear to ensure that the,26
NA,budgets shall balance.,26
NA,The Government has abandoned its own,26
NA,resolution. I t has gone back on the words,26
NA,which the Prime Minister used i n intro-,26
NA,ducing the budget i n July last. I t has,26
NA,gone back on the resolution unanimously,26
NA,carried at a conference of Commonwealth,26
NA,and State Ministers i n August last.,26
NA,"Apparently, the Government realizes that",26
NA,i t cannot carry out the resolution which,26
NA,i t supported except by calling upon all,26
NA,members of the community to make sub-,26
NA,stantial sacrifices; but this i t has not,26
NA,the moral courage to do. This Govern-,26
NA,ment prefers to break its word rather than,26
NA,run the risk of losing votes. I t declines,26
NA,the to carry out what i t undertook to do,26
NA,i n July and August of this year. The,26
NA,Government trembles before the voting,26
NA,strength of the Public Service. The pro-,27
NA,posals of the Government embody a,27
NA,scheme to impose additional income taxa-,27
NA,tion on those in receipt of a salary of,27
NA,£14 a week and over. The figures given,27
NA,in reply to a question asked this after-,27
NA,"noon show that only 1 per cent, of the",27
NA,members of the Public Service enjoy,27
NA,such a salary. What of the other 99 per,27
NA,cent.? One is reminded of a passage in,27
NA,the Scriptures which tells us that one,27
NA,lost sheep was for the time being of more,27
NA,moment than the other 99 within the fold.,27
NA,.Did the members of the Government,27
NA,have this in their minds when consider-,27
NA,ing this proposal or was it the salvation,27
NA,of the 99 votes that actuated them? Last,27
NA,week the Acting Treasurer said-,27
NA,Tliat the community generally is at present,27
NA,"in II state of inertia, and is awaiting a lead source.",27
NA,from some responsible authority to restore,27
NA,confidence. That lead should undoubtedly,27
NA,come from the highest representative body in,27
NA,"ihe community, which is the Commonwealth",27
NA,Government. The Government recognizes this,27
NA,responsibility. The first need i n tlie,27
NA,circumstances is that the Government sliould,27
NA,take steps for the balancing of the budget.,27
NA,The Government does not propose to act,27
NA,upon that principle. It is not giving a,27
NA,lead to the community. No one can say,27
NA,that the proposals outlined in the revised,27
NA,budget can in any sense be regarded as a,27
NA,lend to the community. Neither can it,27
NA,be contended that the steps proposed to,27
NA,be token under the revised proposals will,27
NA,result in balancing the budget.,27
NA,Government is deliberately aiming at a,27
NA,further deficit. The Government's aims,27
NA,"is to add to the accumulated deficit, and",27
NA,"then, like Micawber, to wait for something",27
NA,to turn up. Does the Government,27
NA,seriously anticipate that the revenue will,27
NA,"be greater next year, and that it will be",27
NA,easier then to overcome the obstacles now,27
NA,confronting it than it is this year. The,27
NA,merest tyro must recognize that the,27
NA,"revenue from income taxation, for",27
NA,"instance, will be smaller next year than",27
NA,"it is this year, for the simple reason that",27
NA,income taxation is invariably based on the,27
NA,earnings of the previous year.,27
NA,will pay income taxation this year based,27
NA,on their earnings of la3t year. A large,27
NA,number will pay a fairly substantial,27
NA,amount this year based on last year's,27
NA,"earnings, who will pay practically",27
NA,nothing next year. If the Government,27
NA,thinks that it will be able to balance tbe,27
NA,NA,27
NA,budget next year when it cannot do it,27
NA,"this year, it is doomed to disappointment.",27
Mr MAXWELL ,Perhap s it does not,27
NA,anticipate being in office next year.,27
NA,NA,27
NA,I t is certain that no government could,27
NA,have been more spineless-an d that i3 a,27
NA,flattering term-i n dealing with a difficult,27
NA,situation. Customs revenue cannot,27
NA,reasonably bo expected to be better next,27
NA,year than it has been this year. The,27
NA,arguments which apply to income taxa-,27
NA,tion can also be used in connexion with,27
NA,customs revenue. Importations are,27
NA,usually the result of income obtained,27
NA,"by business firms in the preceding year,",27
NA,"and it is, therefore, extremely improbable",27
NA,that we can expect any immediate,27
NA,improvement in the revenue from this,27
NA,Next year will undoubtedly,27
NA,present its own difficulties without those,27
NA,associated with a deficit this year. The,27
NA,Government should take immediate steps,27
NA,to balance income and expenditure in con-,27
NA,present formity with the Prime Minister's,27
NA,"announcement in July, and with the reso-",27
NA,lution which the Acting Prime Minister,27
NA,and other Ministers assisted to carry at,27
NA,the Melbourne conference in August last.,27
NA,A man can bo excused for living beyond,27
NA,"his income for one year, because he may",27
NA,suffer from an unexpected reduction,27
NA,of his income iu that year. He may be,27
NA,excused also for proceeding on the old,27
NA,"basis of expenditure for the second year,",27
NA,The if he has a reasonable expectation of his,27
NA,income quickly reverting to its,27
NA,normal state. But i f he continues,27
NA,to live beyond his income for,27
NA,a considerable number of years there,27
NA,is nothing ahead of him but insolvency.,27
NA,That is just what the Government is,27
NA,attempting to do; it is not even making,27
NA,"an attempt to balance its budget, but is",27
NA,endeavouring to live beyond its income.,27
NA,"For the last three years, unfortunately,",27
NA,we have had deficits. I n each of those,27
NA,three years-tw o under the administra-,27
NA,"tion of the Bruce-Page Government, and",27
NA,the last under the administration of the /,27
NA,People present Government-effort s were made,27
NA,by the treasurers to balance their budgets.,27
NA,"They did not anticipate, nor did they aim",27
NA,"at, producing deficits. This year, how-",27
NA,"ever, we are i n the extraordinary position",27
NA,that the Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons),27
NA,is deliberately budgeting to spend from,27
NA,"£1,120,000 to £8,120,000 more than he",27
NA,will receive. He himself has told us that,28
NA,"if trade should revive, aud i f his most",28
NA,"sanguine expectations should be realized,",28
NA,"we may expect that, ou the basis of the",28
NA,"budget which was brought down in July,",28
NA,"there will be a deficit of from £S,000,000",28
NA,"to £10,000,000. He has told us, further,",28
NA,that i f the existing depression should con-,28
NA,tinue aud there should be no improve-,28
NA,"ment, we may expect that, on the basis of",28
NA,"the July budget, there will be a deficit of",28
NA,"from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000. That",28
NA,"means that, in tho event of his most opti-",28
NA,"mistic estimate being realized, the best",28
NA,that ho can hope for is that his proposals,28
NA,in the financial statement that he,28
NA,"delivered last week, will leave him with a",28
NA,"deficit of £1.120,000; but that, on the",28
NA,"other hand, i f his worst estimate should",28
NA,prove to be true-an d I profoundly hope,28
NA,that i t will not-unde r this amended,28
NA,budget we shall have a deficit of,28
NA,"£8,120,000. We have no right to further",28
NA,mortgage tho future in that way.,28
NA,"The savings and economies, as they are",28
NA,"called, which are set out in the revised",28
NA,"budget at page 8, total, in round",28
NA,"figures, £1,230,000. I f the Acting",28
NA,Treasurer's estimate of the gap which,28
NA,must be bridged in the event of trade not,28
NA,"improving should prove to be correct,",28
NA,"those savings and economies, on the basis",28
NA,"of the July budget, represent a saving of",28
NA,only one-twelfth of what needs to be,28
NA,"saved, which is equivalent to l d . for every",28
NA,"Is., or Is. Sd. in the £1. I n addition, the",28
NA,Government proposes to divert certain,28
NA,moneys that are now applied to the sink-,28
NA,"ing fund. The diversion of those moneys,",28
NA,"to the extent of a little under £2,000,000,",28
NA,will represent a reduction of the maxi-,28
NA,mum deficit by 2s. 6d. in the £1. I t is,28
NA,dangerous to tamper with any sinking,28
NA,"fund provision. I recognize, however,",28
NA,the extraordinary difficulty in which the,28
NA,"Government finds itself, and I would not",28
NA,be too critical of its action in taking,28
NA,to-day is applied to the sinking fund in,28
NA,"excess of the 10s. per cent, stipulated iu",28
NA,the financial agreement between the Com-,28
NA,"monwealth and the States, provided that",28
NA,that amount was ear-marked to be applied,28
NA,to the sinking fund of the States' debts.,28
NA,"As honorable gentlemen well know, the",28
NA,Commouwealth provides one-third of the,28
NA,"sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per cent, which has",28
NA,to be provided on State debt that,28
NA,existed prior to the commencement of,28
NA,rhe financial agreement. Upon all new,28
NA,debt incurred by the States through the,28
NA,"Loan Council' subsequent to that date,",28
NA,the Commonwealth provides one-half of,28
NA,the sinking fund and the States the other:,28
NA,half. I f the Acting Treasurer would,28
NA,undertake to see that this money which,28
NA,he proposes to divert from Com-,28
NA,"monwealth sinking funds, portion of",28
NA,which is obtained from the profits of,28
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank, and portion",28
NA,"from reparation payments, is ear-marked",28
NA,to provide that portion of the sinking,28
NA,funds of the States provided by theCom-,28
NA,"monwealth, I would not be unduly critical",28
NA,of his proposal in n difficult period like,28
NA,"the present. Reparation payments, par-",28
NA,"ticularly, ought to be used in that way.",28
NA,The Acting Treasurer's difficulties would,28
NA,uot be increased in the slightest degree;,28
NA,it would merely mean that money which,28
NA,formerly was applied to Commonwealth,28
NA,sinking funds in excess of the statutory,28
NA,"10s. per cent, stipulated by the financial",28
NA,agreement would replace money that the,28
NA,Commonwealth would otherwise have to,28
NA,find to provide its quota of the sinking,28
NA,funds of the States. I hope that the Act-,28
NA,ing Treasurer will give consideration to,28
NA,my suggestion.,28
NA,I have stated that the savings and,28
NA,economies foreshadowed in this revised,28
NA,budget amount to only Is. 8d. in the,28
NA,£1 of the amount required on the,28
NA,assumption that we have the tre-,28
NA,mendous deficit which the Acting,28
NA,"Treasurer has forecast, should the pre-",28
NA,"sent depression continue, and that the",28
NA,diversion of sinking fund moneys repre-,28
NA,sents an additional. 2s. 6d. in the £1. The,28
NA,"new taxation proposals, which total",28
NA,"£3,700,000' for the eight montlis",28
NA,"of the financial year that remain,",28
NA,"represent about 25 per cent., or",28
NA,5s. in the £1. Those three items,28
NA,in the aggregate total 9s. 2d. for every,28
NA,"what, £1 which the Treasuror would require in",28
NA,"the event of his worst, expectations being",28
NA,realized. No provision whatever has been,28
NA,made for the other 10s. lOd. in the £1.,28
NA,"On the other hand, i f the Acting",28
NA,Treasurer's most optimistic estimate,28
NA,should prove to be right-an d I hope that,28
NA,it will-w e shall still have a deficit of,28
NA,"from £1,120,000 t.o £3,120,000. Assum-",28
NA,"ing rhere is a revival of trade, and a",28
NA,realization of the honorable gentleman's,28
NA,"best estimate, he has budgeted to bridge",29
NA,"the gap of from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000",29
NA,to the extent of something under,29
NA,"£7,000,000; therefore, he has budgeted",29
NA,with his eyes open for the deficit that,29
NA,I have mentioned in the event of his best,29
NA,"hopes being realized, and for a deficit",29
NA,"of from £5,120,000 to £8,120,000 in the",29
NA,event of his worst fears being borne out.,29
NA,"Surely, the very least that could be",29
NA,expected of any government in such a,29
NA,"position, even though only eight months",29
NA,"of the financial year remain, was to",29
NA,budget to make income and expenditure,29
NA,balance on the most favorable estimate.,29
NA,"Indeed, that would not go nearly far",29
NA,enough. It is the duty of the Government,29
NA,"r,o endeavour to secure a balance upon",29
NA,figures taken at least at a point half,29
NA,way between the estimated minimum,29
NA,and maximum deficits. Had the Govern-,29
NA,ment budgeted to balance its accounts,29
NA,on the expectation that the figures,29
NA,would be adverse to the extent of,29
NA,mid-way between the Treasurer's best and,29
NA,"worst estimates, we could have supported",29
NA,it with a little more enthusiasm than,29
NA,"we can now. To do that, it would be",29
NA,"necessary so to cut expenditure that, in",29
NA,the remaining eight months of the,29
NA,"financial year, there would be an addi-",29
NA,"tional saving of £4,000,000, equivalent",29
NA,"to £6,000,000 in a full",29
NA,"Undoubtedly, that would be very drastic",29
NA,action; but I believe that we have reached,29
NA,"the stage when it ought to be taken, and",29
NA,that if it is not taken a very much more,29
NA,drastic reduction will have to be made,29
NA,next year. The reduction that I have,29
NA,"suggested would involve a 20 per cent,",29
NA,cut on all controllable Commonwealth,29
NA,expenditure. If it were made immediately,29
NA,we might be able to continue perman-,29
NA,ently on that basis; but I believe that if,29
NA,"be not done now, next year we shall have",29
NA,reached such a pass that possibly a 25,29
NA,"per cent, or even a 30 per cent, cut will",29
NA,"be absolutely inescapable, and a degree",29
NA,of hardship will be inflicted which,29
NA,can be avoided if the Government will,29
NA,take its courage in its hands and do the,29
NA,right thing. Why does the Government,29
NA,persist with its Micawber-like attitude of,29
NA,waiting for something to turn up to,29
NA,enable it to carry on indefinitely upon a,29
NA,basis of expenditure that is far beyond,29
NA,our present means? It has no ground,29
NA,NA,29
NA,whatever for expecting that next year's,29
NA,revenue will be even nearly so good as,29
NA,"that of this year. Certainly, next year's",29
NA,"income tax receipts, which will bo based",29
NA,"on this year's income, will be very much",29
NA,"lower than this year's collections, which",29
NA,will be based on last year's income. There-,29
NA,arc in this community persons who still,29
NA,will not realize how much poorer as a,29
NA,nation we are to-day than we were two or,29
NA,"three years ago, when the prices of the",29
NA,commodities that we produce in large-,29
NA,quantities for export were so much higher,29
NA,"than they are now. But, surely the com-",29
NA,bined intelligence of Ministers is suffi-,29
NA,cient to enable them to realize that fact.,29
NA,I t must be obvious to any one who thinks,29
NA,"at all, that Australia's national wealth",29
NA,"is almost entirely, or at any rate very",29
NA,"largely, dependent upon the values placed",29
NA,by the world upon the huge exportable,29
NA,"surplus of our staple products, and that",29
NA,any fall in world prices which affects,29
NA,"those commodities, affects us as a nation.",29
NA,There has been a tremendous fall in the,29
NA,"world's prices for almost all commodities,",29
NA,"manufactured goods or raw materials,",29
NA,and the people of all countries are feeling,29
NA,the effects of this decline in values. We,29
NA,in Australia are suffering to a greater,29
NA,"extent than are the people elsewhere, for",29
NA,the simple reason that values for the par-,29
NA,year. ticular commodities which we produce for,29
NA,export have fallen further than those of,29
NA,other commodities. The prices for manu-,29
NA,factured goods have come down somewhat;.,29
NA,but to nothing like the extent of the fall,29
NA,in prices of raw materials. Thus our,29
NA,primary producers have been hit harder,29
NA,perhaps than other sections of the com-,29
NA,munity. I t is only when we examine in,29
NA,some detail the current prices for the,29
NA,commodities which Australia produces for,29
NA,it export that we realize fully how serious',29
NA,has been the diminution in OUT national-,29
NA,"income, as compared with our position-",29
NA,only two or three years ago. As is well,29
NA,"known to all, our principal export com-",29
NA,modity is wool. For about six years prior,29
NA,to 1929 our average wool cheque was in,29
NA,"the neighbourhood of £70,000,000. This",29
NA,"year it will be about £30,000,000. I n",29
NA,"other words, as regards wool alone, the loss",29
NA,in our national income will be approxi-,29
NA,"mately £40,000,000. Wheat ranks next",29
NA,in value among our principal export com-,29
NA,"modities. I t is difficult, at the moment.",29
NA,to assess the average price which will be,30
NA,received for our exports of wheat this,30
NA,year; but I believe that we shall have to be,30
NA,content with at least 2s. per bushel less,30
NA,"than we have enjoyed in recent years. I f ,",30
NA,"as seems likely, our exportable surplus",30
NA,"this year should be .150,000,000 bushels,",30
NA,a reduction in price of 2s. per bushel will,30
NA,mean a further drop in income of,30
NA,"£15,000,000. Another important export",30
NA,commodity is dairy produce. Butter to-,30
NA,day is selling at 6d. per lb. less than at,30
NA,the corresponding period of last year. I f,30
NA,our exportable surplus this year should,30
NA,"be in the neighbourhood of 54,000 tons- I",30
NA,"do not consider this an over-estimate,",30
NA,because our exports have been as high as,30
NA,"65,000 tons and the average is' about",30
NA,"40,000 tons- a decline of 6d. per lb. will",30
NA,"represent a further loss of £3,000,000.",30
NA,Fruit and meat prices also have fallen,30
NA,lately. So also have world's values,30
NA,for metals of all descriptions. The,30
NA,Commonwealth Year-Booh for 1926-27,30
NA,"shows that our export of metals, the",30
NA,product of mines and quarries in,30
NA,"Australia, i n that year were £20,000,000.",30
NA,That figure has been cut at least,30
NA,"in half this year, because spelter",30
NA,has fallen from £25 per ton to £14 per,30
NA,"ton, and lead, copper and tin have also",30
NA,declined seriously. Except for compara-,30
NA,tively insignificant items our exportable,30
NA,products are almost wholly made,30
NA,"up of wool, wheat, dairy produce,",30
NA,"meat, fruits, and metals, and i t is",30
NA,"safe to assume, from the figures which I",30
NA,"have quoted, that our national income",30
NA,"this year from the pastoral, agricultural,",30
NA,"dairying, meat, fruit and metal",30
NA,industries will decline by between,30
NA,"£60,000,000 and £70,000,000'. Probably",30
NA,"the figure will be £70,000,000.",30
NA,"In 1927-28, we received from the sale",30
NA,"of these products £132,000,000, so the",30
NA,decline in value represents a reduction,30
NA,in our national income of about 50 per,30
NA,"cent, for the same volume of goods.",30
NA,We have to ask ourselves i f this is,30
NA,merely a passing phase in our trade posi-,30
NA,"tion, or i f it is likely that the markets",30
NA,these commodities will so suddenly re-,30
NA,cover that we shall be iustified in main-,30
NA,taining governmental expenditure at the,30
NA,same rate as hitherto. I think that prices,30
NA,for these commodities must recover some-,30
NA,"what, for the simrjle reason that present",30
NA,values are so far below the cost of pro-,30
NA,duction that unless some upward ten-,30
NA,dency occurs soon large numbers of pro-,30
NA,ducers and manufacturers in all coun-,30
NA,tries will be driven out of business. But,30
NA,he would be a very sanguine man-in -,30
NA,deed he would be a super-optimist-wh o,30
NA,predicted a f u l l recovery in the value of,30
NA,these products to the levels of the last few,30
NA,years. I think that possibly prices will,30
NA,recover to the extent of two-thirds the,30
NA,rates ruling in recent years. I f my,30
NA,"assumption is correct, i t is obvious that",30
NA,"the prices for all manufactured goods,",30
NA,"and the cost of services generally, must",30
NA,be forced down to the new level of two-,30
NA,thirds the average prices for our staple,30
NA,exports during the last two or three years.,30
NA,"I f this is done, we shall be able to con-",30
NA,tinue to produce for export; i f it is not,30
NA,"done, our primary producers will be",30
NA,unable to carry on.,30
NA,"Unfortunately, this Government is",30
NA,taking no steps whatever to assist iu,30
NA,"bringing about, at the earliest possible",30
NA,"moment, a proper relationship between",30
NA,the prices of manufactured goods and the,30
NA,"cost of services, and the prices of pri-",30
NA,"mary products. On the contrary, its",30
NA,"action, lately in imposing high tariffs and",30
NA,embargoes has had the effect .of retard-,30
NA,ing any tendency to a proper adjustment,30
NA,in the relationship of commodity prices,30
NA,"and cost of services. Indeed, the present",30
NA,"Government seems to be anxious, not",30
NA,merely to keep the prices for all manu-,30
NA,factured goods and the cost of services at,30
NA,"the old level, but, i f possible, to increase",30
NA,them. A question was asked in this,30
NA,House this afternoon about the cost of,30
NA,"fencing wire, a commodity largely used",30
NA,by our primary producers. I t had rela-,30
NA,tion to a report in the press only the,30
NA,other day that the manufacturers of fenc-,30
NA,ing wire and wire netting were increasing,30
NA,their prices practically to the extent of,30
NA,the duty imposed on fencing wire in lieu,30
NA,of the bounty. To encourage the manu-,30
NA,facture in Australia of requisites essen-,30
NA,"tial to primary producers, former govern-",30
NA,ments legislated for the payment of,30
NA,for bounties in preference to the imposition,30
NA,"of customs duties, thus ensuring that price",30
NA,levels should approximate freetrade im-,30
NA,port rates. This policy was to the ad-,30
NA,"vantage of primary producers, who have",30
NA,to sell their commodities in open com-,30
NA,petition i n the world's markets. But,30
NA,this Government recently made a drastic,30
NA,uIteration.' I t withdrew the bounty pay-,31
NA,"ments and imposed, instead, customs",31
NA,"duties, with the inevitable result that",31
NA,"pricesof fencing wire, galvanized iron,",31
NA,;,31
NA,"&c, are now being increased to the",31
NA,limit permitted by the tariff. I t is clear,31
NA,to all that this Government does not really,31
NA,appreciate its obligation to our primary,31
NA,"producers, who, to-day, are practically",31
NA,"without a living wage, owing to the serious",31
NA,"decline in world's prices for their wool,",31
NA,"wheat, and other exportable products",31
NA,Formerly the people as a whole,31
NA,"through the Government, bore some",31
NA,portion of the burden of carrying,31
NA,on these secondary industries on,31
NA,an artificial basis. Now it appears,31
NA,tliat the primary producer and the users,31
NA,of these commodities will have to bear,31
NA,the whole of it. I t should be the duty of,31
NA,this Parliament so to modify the tariff,31
NA,as to make it possible for costs of pro-,31
NA,duction in secondary industries to be,31
NA,brought to a more reasonable price rela-,31
NA,tion to the value of our export staple,31
NA,products. The recent Increases in cus-,31
NA,"toms duties, and the imposition of super",31
NA,"taxes, have beeu retarding the natural",31
NA,fall in price levels.,31
NA,Wc have heard a good deal lately about,31
NA,the need for equality of sacrifice. I agree,31
NA,that this is very desirable. Already the,31
NA,"primary producers, as I have shown,",31
NA,have suffered heavily owing to the tre-,31
NA,mendous drop in the world's prices for,31
NA,"their exportable surplus products, and I",31
NA,suggest that some sacrifice should now be,31
NA,expected of those who cater for the needs,31
NA,of our farmers. I have lately had,31
NA,brought under ' my notice some extra-,31
NA,"ordinary examples of hardship, and 1",31
NA,shall cite one or two instances,31
NA,to bring home to honorable mem-,31
NA,bers the true position of,31
NA,"primary producers. Recently, when I",31
NA,was touring through a wheat-growing dis-,31
NA,"trict in New South Wales, I met a num-",31
NA,ber of returned soldier wheat-growers. I,31
NA,asked one of them what his own,31
NA,"crop was like, and, in reply, he",31
NA,said that if rain had come three weeks,31
NA,or a month earlier he would have had a,31
NA,"magnificent crop, but, as things were, he",31
NA,would find it hard to carry on.,31
NA,explained that a day or two prior to my,31
NA,visit an oflicer of the Rural Industries,31
NA,"Board-the body which, in New South",31
NA,"Wales, finances returned soldiers in",31
NA,NA,31
NA,fanning operations-ha d inspected his,31
NA,farm for the purpose of estimating the,31
NA,value of his crop. This oflicer told him,31
NA,"that, owing to adverse weather conditions,",31
NA,he could expect no return from one-half,31
NA,"of his cultivation, a,nd a bag per acre",31
NA,"from the other half.,",31
NA,Mr C. RIMY -Wha t district did the,31
NA,honorable member visit?,31
NA,NA,31
NA,bidgee area. The representative of the,31
NA,-Rural Industries Board told this young,31
NA,"man that, judging from the appearance",31
NA,"of his crop, i f rain had come a month",31
NA,earlier he would have had twelve bags,31
NA,"to the acre. This returned soldier, I may",31
NA,"add, was not grumbling at his i l l fortune.",31
NA,"He merely stated the facts, and was",31
NA,accepting the blow with remarkable forti-,31
NA,tude. Another instance that came under,31
NA,my notice was the plight of two young,31
NA,"men, who had invested £16,000, repre-",31
NA,"senting the whole of their capital, in the",31
NA,purchase of a small station property,31
NA,two years ago believing that wool-growing,31
NA,would continue to be profitable.,31
NA,As the f u l l purchase price was,31
NA,".£43,000, they arranged a mort-",31
NA,"gage for the balance, and also borrowed",31
NA,sufficient to stock the property. They,31
NA,had obtained two seasons' wool clips;,31
NA,but the price obtained was so,31
NA,low that the other day these young,31
NA,men interviewed the man from whom they,31
NA,had borrowed the money and advised him,31
NA,"to take over the property, as they could",31
NA,not possibly meet their interest liabilities,31
NA,this year. Although these young men,31
NA,"had iost the whole of their capital, they",31
NA,"were not complaining; but, like the",31
NA,"returned soldier wheat-grower, they",31
NA,accepted the inevitable with praiseworthy,31
NA,courage and philosophy. I now invite,31
NA,our honorable members to consider the sacri-,31
NA,fices that have been and are being made,31
NA,by thousands of primary producers such,31
NA,as these young men to whom I have,31
NA,"alluded, and compare their position with",31
NA,that of the public servants of New South,31
NA,"Wales, some of whom are complaining",31
NA,"bitterly about a cut of S-J per cent, in",31
NA,"their salaries. I t is amazing, to my",31
NA,"mind, that this Government is not taking",31
NA,He some action to ensure equality of sacrifice,31
NA,so far as that is possible on the,31
NA,part of every person in the com-,31
NA,munity. The effect of the increased,31
NA,"duties, super taxes, and embargoes which",31
NA,liave been placed upon imported goods,32
NA,has been to retard the natural fall in,32
NA,"price of manufactured articles, a fall",32
NA,which would be desirable for many,32
NA,"reasons, and would bring them more into",32
NA,conformity with the prices of our export-,32
NA,able products. We were told some time,32
NA,ago that the embargoes and increased,32
NA,duties had been imposed with the object of,32
NA,improving the trade balance; that that,32
NA,policy was not governed by ordinary,32
NA,"economic considerations, but represented",32
NA,special action taken by the Government,32
NA,to meet a particular emergency. Some,32
NA,"of us asserted"" at that time that the very",32
NA,"high rate of exchange, together with our",32
NA,"poverty as purchasers, would be quite",32
NA,sumcient to restrict imports without the,32
NA,imposition of super taxes and embargoes.,32
NA,That has been proved. Only the other,32
NA,day I saw some authoritative statistics,32
NA,which showed that the decline in our,32
NA,imports has taken place in almost exactly,32
NA,the same proportion i n those goods which,32
NA,"come into the country duty free, as in",32
NA,"those upon which increased, tariff duties",32
NA,have been imposed.,32
NA,The only successful method of increas-,32
NA,ing the volume and value of our exports,32
NA,-an d I take it that all honorable mem-,32
NA,bers feel that the best means of getting,32
NA,out of our financial difficulty is to increase,32
NA,our export production-i s to bring about,32
NA,lower production costs. That cannot be,32
NA,achieved with the present tariff millstone,32
NA,a bout our necks. Some of the flat rates,32
NA,of dnty which have been recently imposed,32
NA,"for protective purposes are, compared",32
NA,"with the ordinary ad valorem duties,",32
NA,absolutely absurd in the light of the,32
NA,present fall in the value of the goods.,32
NA,"Flat rates, which possibly represented",32
NA,"40 per eent. or 50 per cent, previously,",32
NA,now represent as much as 100 per cent.,32
NA,Our first duty as a parliament is,32
NA,to remove crushing customs duties,32
NA,from the essential machinery of pro-,32
NA,duction. I should like to impress,32
NA,on. the Government the absolute,32
NA,impossibility of encouraging exports,32
NA,uncier the existing tariff policy.,32
NA,people believe that our trade balance and,32
NA,overseas credit can be best improved by,32
NA,greater production for export. I am one,32
NA,of those who believe tbat. There are,32
NA,"others who seem, to cling to the belief that",32
NA,the only way to improve our trade,32
NA,balance is to restrict imports by raising,32
NA,"the tariff, thus increasing the cost of",32
NA,production. The restriction of imports,32
NA,by means of an ever-increasing tariff has,32
NA,the effect of putting a brake on export,32
NA,by adding to the cost of production. To,32
NA,ask men to increase production for export,32
NA,"in order to improve the exchange position,",32
NA,and at the same time increasing their,32
NA,costs by the imposition of prohibitive,32
NA,tariffs-t o ask them to open up new,32
NA,markets while prejudicing those markets,32
NA,against them by embargoes and an,32
NA,absurd tariff vo\ioy-i s like requiring,32
NA,"a horse to pull a load up n steep hill, and",32
NA,at the same time putting on the brake,32
NA,in order to keep the vehicle from slipping,32
NA,back.,32
NA,I f we maintain the prices of manufac-,32
NA,tured articles in this country at a higher,32
NA,level than prevails anywhere else i n the,32
NA,"world, i t must have the effect eventually",32
NA,of debasing the standard of living in Aus-,32
NA,"tralia. Some persons argue the opposite,",32
NA,but my contention is that i f high prices,32
NA,be maintained many articles which ought,32
NA,"to be in the homes of the poor people, as",32
NA,"well as in those of the well-to-do, will be",32
NA,quite out of the reach of the great mass,32
NA,"of the people. Therefore, the standard",32
NA,"of comfort must be lower than i t ought,",32
NA,to be. I believe that only in a policy of,32
NA,sane tariff reform leading to lower costs,32
NA,does there lie any hope for the future. I f,32
NA,"such a policy be followed, we may expect",32
NA,to have our people re-employed at the,32
NA,best wages that Australia can provide for,32
NA,"them, taking into account the amount of",32
NA,our national income. We must remember,32
NA,that it is impossible to take a quart out,32
NA,"of a pint pot, though some persons",32
NA,evidently seem anxious to make the,32
NA,a ttempt.,32
NA,Meanwhile the immediate task before,32
NA,Parliament is to balance the budget as,32
NA,was promised by the Prime Minister in,32
NA,"July, and in accordance with the under-",32
NA,taking entered into by him with the,32
NA,Premiers of the States in August last.,32
NA,This revised budget falls very far short of,32
NA,Some achieving that desirable end. Those hon-,32
NA,orable members who are concerned about,32
NA,the future of their country are profoundly,32
NA,disappointed with the Government's finan-,32
NA,cial proposals. To budget deliberately,32
NA,"for a deficit of anything from £1,000,000",32
NA,"to £S,000,000 merely because the Govern-",32
NA,ment is afraid to make those economies,32
NA,which it knows should be made is not,33
NA,the way to restore our national credit.,33
NA,"Such action must injure our credit, which",33
NA,is low enough as it is. What is the posi-,33
NA,tion in New Zealand? We have heard,33
NA,in the past a great deal about our enor-,33
NA,"mous national debt, and that Australia",33
NA,is carrying a tremendous load of debt per,33
NA,head of population-Stat e and Common-,33
NA,"wealth. I t is indeed a very big debt,",33
NA,but the fact remains that the national,33
NA,debt of New Zealand is greater per head,33
NA,than the national debt of Australia-Stat e,33
NA,and Gommonwealth combined. Yet New,33
NA,Zealand's credit is so good that her 5 per,33
NA,"cent, bonds are worth on the London mar-",33
NA,ket £102 10s. as compared with £75 for,33
NA,Australian bonds. Tlie credit of South,33
NA,"Africa also is thoroughly sound, and her",33
NA,"5 per cent, bonds are worth £100 15s.",33
NA,Our credit would not have fallen so,33
NA,low i f the Government had had the,33
NA,courage to face the situation as it should,33
NA,have done. I can speak for the members,33
NA,"of my own party, and, I think,",33
NA,for every honorable member on,33
NA,"this side of the House, when",33
NA,I say that had. the Government,33
NA,brought down proposals to economise suf-,33
NA,ficiently to balance the budget it would,33
NA,have had the unqualified support of every,33
NA,member on this side of the House. The,33
NA,Government should have taken steps . to,33
NA,honour the two pledges to which I have,33
NA,referred. Those promises were made not,33
NA,"by us but by the Government, yet we",33
NA,would be prepared to support the,33
NA,Government in auy measures of,33
NA,economy designed to carry them out.,33
NA,"Evidently, the Government is prepared",33
NA,"to break its own word in this matter,",33
NA,because it lacks the courage to do what,33
NA,it knows ought to be done. I support,33
NA,the amendment moved by the Leader of,33
NA,"the Opposition. ,",33
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,War-,33
NA,ringah) [5.15] - I should have thought,33
NA,"that in a debate of this kind when, one",33
NA,"might say, the fate of the country is",33
NA,"hanging i n the balance, at least some",33
NA,orahle members on the Government side,33
NA,of the House would have risen in their,33
NA,places to defend the Government's finan-,33
NA,cial proposals. I should have thought,33
NA,"that there would, perhaps, be some hon-",33
NA,orable members on the opposite side who,33
NA,would have ranged themselves behind the,33
NA,pledges given by the Prime Minister in,33
NA,"July last, and the undertaking. entered",33
NA,into by him in August with the Premiers,33
NA,of the various States. I had looked for,33
NA,some pronouncement from them which,33
NA,would have had the effect of maintaining,33
NA,"and supporting our national credit, with-",33
NA,out which we can achieve nothing in the,33
NA,"present crisis. Evidently, however, the",33
NA,statement of the Acting Treasurer is to,33
NA,"go unsupported, and no reply is to he",33
NA,made to the devastating criticism levelled,33
NA,against the budget by the Leader of the,33
NA,Opposition this afternoon. I n the course,33
NA,"of a clear, forceful and analytical speech,",33
NA,the Leader of the Opposition exposed the,33
NA,hollow hypocrisy of ' the Government's,33
NA,"proposals, and pointed out how far those",33
NA,proposals fell short of what our national,33
NA,honour demanded should be done.,33
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Norman.,33
NA,Makin) -I t is not proper for the honor-,33
NA,able member to suggest that anything,33
NA,dishonorable has been done.,33
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,O f,33
NA,"course I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker,",33
NA,"However, I shall say it outside.",33
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable mem-,33
NA,ber will not be in order in saying it here.,33
NA,Mr ARCHDAL E PARKHILL -,33
NA,The platforms of this country will ring,33
NA,with the statements I have just made,33
NA,regarding the inadequacy of these pro-,33
NA,"posals to meet"" the situation. Everyone",33
NA,now admits its seriousness. I f the Go-,33
NA,vernment had brought down proposals,33
NA,in accordance with the terms of the Mel-,33
NA,bourne agreement-tha t agreement which,33
NA,was signed by the Prime Minister him- ',33
NA,self after he had conferred with his,33
NA,cabinet-w e on this side of the House,33
NA,would have done our utmost to assist it.,33
NA,"While I am prepared, even now, to sup-",33
NA,port the Government in any reasonable,33
NA,"proposals, I shall not remain silent when",33
NA,I see it perpetrating cruel injustices on,33
NA,sections of my fellow citizens. I blame,33
NA,the Government for not having the,33
NA,courage to cope with the situation,33
NA,hon- in its early stages. The gravest doubts,33
NA,were expressed as to the wisdom of the,33
NA,departure of the Prime Minister ( Mr.,33
NA,Scullin) for England at such a critical,33
NA,"period. However, the right honorable",33
NA,gentleman signed an undertaking that cer-,33
NA,tain action should be taken by the Govern-,33
NA,"ment, and nothing can convince me that",33
NA,ii was not the bounden duty of the Go-,34
NA,vernment to place those proposals before,34
NA,"this House promptly. Instead, it vacil-",34
NA,lated and allowed the position to become,34
NA,more acute. I t was only after the result,34
NA,of the New South Wales elections had,34
NA,been announced and the problem had be-,34
NA,"come alarmingly dangerous and difficult,",34
NA,rhat Parliament was called together. As,34
NA,"far back as last August, Cabinet agreed",34
NA,"that certain action should be taken, but",34
NA,it was as late as the 3rd October last,34
NA,before the Acting Prime Minister ( Mr.,34
NA,Penton) stated- -,34
NA,The Cabinet lias met and discussed the,34
NA,"""-hole financial position. Proposals to",34
NA,"the budget, submitted by the sub-committee",34
NA,"of the Cabinet, were discussed and were",34
NA,approved substantially as presented. I t was,34
NA,agreed that the expenditure must be reduced,34
NA,"at the rate of approximately £4,000,000 a year.",34
NA,He asserted that the party would meet on,34
NA,"Monday, the 27th October, and that",34
NA,Parliament would be called together on,34
NA,"Thursday, the 30th October.",34
NA,announcement is definite.,34
NA,"agreed to reduce the budget by £4,000,000",34
NA,"per annum. Now, after all that delay,",34
NA,the Government comes down with a pro-,34
NA,"posed reduction which is, comparatively,",34
NA,a mere bagatelle.,34
NA,I t is apparent from the financial state-,34
NA,ment of the Acting Treasurer ( Mr.,34
NA,Lyons) that the honorable gentleman did,34
NA,his utmost to pursuade the Government,34
NA,to agree to a more satisfactory and effec-,34
NA,tive arrangement. A close examination,34
NA,"of his speech makes it obvious that, while",34
NA,it embodies the Acting Treasurer's desires,34
NA,"to a certain point, the pruning knife has",34
NA,"been used severely, and party interpola-",34
NA,tions are numerous. I give the Acting,34
NA,Treasurer all credit for his endeavour to,34
NA,give effect to the honorable intentions of,34
NA,"his leader, and realize that his endeavours",34
NA,have been checked by the' party.,34
NA,"Certainly, the proposals advanced fall",34
NA,deplorably short of what is necessary.,34
NA,Three different opinions are advanced,34
NA,by different sections in this chamber.,34
NA,There are those who believe that,34
NA,the position can be righted only by,34
NA,"strict economy, the payment of our debts,",34
NA,and a reduction in the cost of production.,34
NA,Another section apparently wants us co,34
NA,"pay our way, but at the same time desires",34
NA,to maintain our fictitious rates of wag^s,34
NA,"and standard of living, without advanc-",34
NA,ing any definite plans to enable that to,34
NA,"be done. Like all weak people, adherents",34
NA,of that section are floundering in the,34
NA,morass of political expediency and moral,34
NA,cowardice. I n that category I place the,34
NA,"Government. Then there is a third section,",34
NA,composed of members who are prepared,34
NA,to repudiate the nation's debts rather than,34
NA,"reduce wages or extend hours of labour,,",34
NA,believing that therein lies their easiest,34
NA,"political path. I believe, definitely, that",34
NA,the salvation of Australia lies only in the,34
NA,adoption of the first method. By resort-,34
NA,"ing to the inflation of currency, under the",34
NA,"guise of "" stabilization,"" "" extension of",34
NA,"credit,"" or any other fanciful name, we",34
NA,balance should merely impose upon our people,34
NA,hardships similar to those placed on their,34
NA,workers by the central powers of Europe.,34
NA,And the result would be the same.,34
NA,Despite the poverty and misery inflicted,34
NA,"upon those unfortunate, people, their go- -",34
NA,vernments eventually have had to return,34
NA,"to the only sane course, that which we on",34
NA,"That this side advocated at the last election,",34
NA,"Cabinet and advocate now, the first of the three",34
NA,proposals that I have enunciated. Only,34
NA,by such methods can we conform to,34
NA,"honorable principles, and l i f t Australia",34
NA,out of the slough of financial despondency,34
NA,into which it has temporarily fallen.,34
Mr A GREEN ,B y lowering wages?,34
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,,34
NA,"Actually, it would not lower real wages.",34
NA,I t is possible to increase the currency and,34
NA,give our workers wages nominally twice,34
NA,"as high as those at present paid, but these",34
NA,would not purchase half as much as do,34
NA,"existing wages. I do desire, not the",34
NA,"reduction of real wages, but a re-adjust-",34
NA,ment of the position to provide that every-,34
NA,body shall make an equal sacrifice in the,34
NA,effort to stabilize the country. The second,34
NA,method t.o which I have referred is a,34
NA,weak and cowardly way of dealing with,34
NA,"the difficulty, while the third course is",34
NA,"utterly dishonest, and unworthy of a",34
NA,responsible government. I t is just as dis-,34
NA,honest for a nation to refuse to pay its,34
NA,just debts as it is for an individual to do,34
NA,so. Any nation that is prepared to resort,34
NA,to subterfuge in an endeavour to evade its,34
NA,"liabilities, by issuing valueless paper",34
NA,"money, and similar efforts to undermine",34
NA,"the national stability, must inevitably",34
NA,reap the financial whirlwind that has been,34
NA,the reward of other nations which have,34
NA,adopted such methods.,34
NA,This Government lias failed utterly,35
NA,to eifect the economies which i t promised,35
NA,"in August last, when i t entered into an",35
NA,agreement with the States. I t then made,35
NA,a distinct compact with the Labour,35
NA,Premiers of Victoria and South Aus-,35
NA,"tralia, and the National Premiers of the",35
NA,other States. A l l were to live within,35
NA,their revenues and endeavour to balance,35
NA,their budgets. To give effect to that,35
NA,undertaking it was necessary to act in,35
NA,a manner which is disagreeable to any,35
NA,"politician. No cabinet, either National",35
NA,"or Labour, likes to reduce the wages of",35
NA,"its civil servants, or to impose grinding",35
NA,"taxation upo.n the people. However, the",35
NA,Premiers returned to their respective,35
NA,States perfectly trustful of the good faith,35
NA,of the Commonwealth. They honoured,35
NA,"their undertakings, and performed their",35
NA,disagreeable tasks.,35
Mr MORGAN ,An d the Commonwealth,35
NA,"Government "" squibbed "".",35
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , will,35
NA,That is what it amounts to. This,35
NA,Labour Government is the only one of the,35
NA,seven which entered into the agreement,35
NA,which has failed to honour its under-,35
NA,"takings, not only with regard to economy",35
NA,but also with regard to taxation.,35
Mr A GREEN ,Suc h action is quite,35
NA,"in accordance with the National policy,",35
NA,but it is pretty hard for a. Labour Go-,35
NA,vernment to carry out.,35
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,,35
NA,The honorable gentleman -is trying to be,35
NA,"nasty, and at the same time justify the",35
NA,supine attitude of his Government. He,35
NA,is not prepared to stand up like a man,35
NA,and make a speech to defend that atti-,35
NA,tude. The most effective defence that,35
NA,his Government can put forward is the,35
NA,feeble excuse that the task is not a,35
NA,pleasant one. Was it pleasant for Mr.,35
NA,"Hogan or Mr Hill, the Labour Premiers",35
NA,of Victoria and South Australia? Could,35
NA,anything be more contemptible and more,35
NA,"pitiable than that excuse, offered in ex-",35
NA,tenuation of the inaction of the Common-,35
NA,wealth Labour Government at a time,35
NA,when Australia is passing through the,35
NA,most critical period in its history?,35

NA,"popularity hounds, that's all.",35
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Norman Makin).,35
NA,-Order ! I require the honorable mem-,35
NA,ber for Perth ( Mr Nairn) to withdraw,35
NA,that remark.,35
Mr NAIRN , I withdraw it.,35
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,,35
NA,When addressing the Loan Council last,35
NA,"June, the ex-Treasurer, the honorable",35
NA,"member for Dalley ( Mr Theodore),",35
NA,stated-,35
NA,"Tlie Treasurers feel, however, in view of",35
NA,"tho difficult outlook generally, that i t is proper",35
NA,und advisable for them to urge upon-all Go-,35
NA,vernments the need for the utmost economy,35
NA,"with regard to expenditure, also that it is",35
NA,essential for the budgets of the Commonwealth,35
NA,and tlie States to be balanced for the forth-,35
NA,coming limmcial year.,35
NA,Neither of those essential things is being,35
NA,"done by this Government. Speaking at,",35
NA,the Royal Agricultural Show luncheon,35
NA,"on the 17th April of this year, the",35
NA,"honorable gentleman, who was then'Trea-",35

NA,"be a diminution"" of £30,000,000 i n Com-",35
NA,"monwealth revenue, and £50,000,000 less to",35
NA,spend. The facts are so obvious that whether,35
NA,"we like i t : o r not, we shall be compelled to",35
NA,resort to economy; economy by governments,35
NA,and economies by communities as well.,35
NA,"He went on to say, and honorable mem-",35
NA,bers will be amused when they hear the,35
NA,quotation further-,35
NA,I am confident. people will give full credit,35
NA,to the Government that faces tho position,35
NA,honestly.,35
NA,I t cannot be said that this Government,35
NA,"has faced the position honestly, nnd no",35
NA,credit can be given to it. Its present,35
NA,proposals are of no practical use i n meet-,35
NA,ing the situation.,35
NA,When the first budget was introduced,35
NA,"earlier this year, the Opposition proposed",35
NA,reductions in expenditure totalling about,35
NA,"£4,000,000. I remember advocating,",35
NA,"among other things, that the proposed",35
NA,"vote of £1,000,000 for unemployment re-",35
NA,"lief should not be expended, because the",35
NA,responsibility for dealing with unemploy-,35
NA,ment rested with the States. The,35
NA,supporters of the Government howled at,35
NA,me at that time for even suggesting that,35
NA,this money should not be made available,35
NA,to relieve the sufferings of the community.,35
NA,I t was said that i t was imperative that,35
NA,the money should be voted so that relief,35
NA,"works could be put i n hand. But what,",35
NA,has been done with that money? No less,35
NA,"than £850,000 of it-all - that was avail-",36
NA,able-ha s been paid' to South Australia,36
NA,to relieve its impecuniosity. The state-,36
NA,ments of honorable members opposite that,36
NA,it was imperative that this money should,36
NA,be made available for relief works for the,36
NA,unemployed have been proved to be gross,36
NA,hypocrisy.,36
Mr FRANCIS ,Tb e money has been,36
NA,used to help in paying South Australia's,36
NA,interest bill.,36
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Tha t,36
NA,is so. I suppose that it has been used,36
NA,to assist in meeting the cost of the new,36
NA,"Adelaide railway station, or something of",36
NA,"that kind. At any rate, the unemployed",36
NA,have not received the slightest benefit,36
NA,from it.,36
NA,The total reductions in expenditure,36
NA,that the Government has been able to,36
NA,"achieve amount to £1,230,000; but against",36
NA,these reductions there have been increases,36
NA,"totalling £S00,000-£400,00 0 in additional",36
NA,"pension payments, and £400,000 in in-",36
NA,creased exchange charges. The net,36
NA,result of all the Government's economies,36
NA,has been a reduction in expenditure,36
NA,"of a paltry £430,000 in a total expendi-",36
NA,"ture of £65,587,770. I n the circumstances",36
NA,I consider that I am justified in saying,36
NA,that the Government has made no serious,36
NA,-effort to reduce its expenditure. That,36
NA,must be the opinion of any one who looks,36
NA,at the situation without prejudice or,36
NA,party bias. I propose to deal in detail,36
NA,with some of the proposals of the Govern-,36
NA,ment.,36
NA,I t is intended to effect a reduction,36
NA,the salaries of Ministers and members.,36
NA,The Government has been forced by con-,36
NA,siderations of simple honesty to bring,36
NA,"forward this proposition, but it is seeking",36
NA,to bring about this reduction by a mere,36
NA,subterfuge. The reduction is to be made,36
NA,in the form of taxation at the time of the,36
NA,payment of the salaries. I t is being done,36
NA,in this way in order to make i t easy to,36
NA,return to the original remuneration at the,36
NA,earliest possible moment. The general,36
NA,public can see through this artifice. I t,36
NA,is petty meannesses of this kind that bring,36
NA,honorable members of this and other,36
NA,Parliaments into disrepute.,36
Mr A GREEN ,Tha t is not so.,36
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,I n said,36
NA,my opinion it is so. I f the Government,36
NA,had come forward boldly and proposed reasonable.,36
NA,"a straightout reduction of members'""",36
NA,"salaries to £500, or i f it had even proposed",36
NA,"a straightout reduction by 10 per cent,",36
NA,something could have been said for the,36
NA,"proposal, but to effect a reduction by",36
NA,means of taxation of the kind suggested,36
NA,"is petty and mean. No doubt, the first",36
NA,opportunity will be taken to restore the,36
NA,"remuneration of members to £1,000.",36
NA,Honorable members opposite will greedily,36
NA,revert to that figure on the first favorable,36
NA,occasion. I repeat that such conduct,36
NA,brings upon membership of this Parlia-,36
NA,"ment, public opprobrium.",36
NA,I t is proposed to reduce the salaries,36
NA,"of certain public servants, but no",36
NA,salaries affected by the Government's,36
NA,proposal are to be reduced below £725.,36
NA,The Leader of the Opposition has already,36
NA,dealt clearly and penetratingly with this,36
NA,"proposal, and has shown the sham and",36
NA,"hollowness of it. Out of 40,000.Com-",36
NA,"monwealth public servants, only 440, in-",36
NA,"cluding members of Parliament, are to",36
NA,be taxed. Nothing more grotesque could,36
NA,be imagined than this proposal for,36
NA,meeting the difficult financial situa-,36
NA,tion wliich faces the Government.,36
NA,"I am confident that, with few ex-",36
NA,"ceptions, all the members of the Com-",36
NA,inonwoalth Public Service would be will-,36
NA,ing to submit to a graduated reduction,36
NA,of their salaries iu these difficult times.,36
NA,"They feel, as a inatter of fact, that they",36
NA,are being put in a false position by the,36
NA,Government's proposal to tax only the,36
NA,"higher salaries, and they would be quite",36
NA,willing to agree to reductions similar to,36
NA,in those which are being imposed upon,36
NA,State public servants. I f the Govern-,36
NA,ment would introduce a properly,36
NA,graduated tax or salary reduction to,36
NA,"apply to the Public Service generally,",36
NA,"it would be able to save, not a mere",36
NA,"£60,000, but probably £1,000,000 out of",36
NA,"the £11,000,000 paid annually to the",36
NA,Public Service. The present proposal,36
NA,must inevitably bring the Government,36
NA,into contumely.,36
Mr CROUCH,Woul d the honorable,36
NA,member tax every public servant?,36
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , 1,36
NA,am not required to answer the questions,36
NA,of the honorable member for Coranga-,36
NA,"mite ( Mr Crouch), but I have already",36
NA,that I consider a graduated reduc-,36
NA,tion on a general basis to be fair and,36
NA,The Government's proposals in regard,37
NA,to payments to sinking funds are un*-,37
NA,"satisfactory and unworthy. They amount,",37
NA,"in a measure at least, to a repudiation of",37
NA,the terms upon which money has been,37
NA,borrowed both at home and abroad. I f,37
NA,the honorable member for Corangamite,37
NA,had loaned money privately on certain,37
NA,"securities, he would not at a later stage",37
NA,be prepared to hand back the securities,37
NA,on the promise of the borrower to provide,37
NA,securities not quite so good as those,37
NA,originally given. Although the honor-,37
NA,able member would not do that in his,37
NA,"private dealings, he is quite prepared",37
NA,to do it in his public operations.,37
NA,NA,37
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,,37
NA,r,37
NA,That is to the honorable member's credit.,37
Mr CROUCH ,Th e cases referred to by,37
NA,the honorable member for Warringah,37
NA,are not parallel.,37
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , I,37
NA,thought the honorable member would get,37
NA,out of it in some way. I f the Bruce-,37
NA,Page Government had adopted the,37
NA,methods that this Government is resort-,37
NA,ing to in order to balance the public,37
NA,"accounts, it could easily have finished",37
NA,each financial year with a surplus. But,37
NA,it would not descend to using reparation,37
NA,payments for current purposes as this,37
NA,"Government has already done, and i t",37
NA,certainly would not have dreamt of de-,37
NA,faulting in sinking fund payments ae,37
NA,this Government is now proposing to do.,37
NA,The raiding of the sinking funds by the,37
NA,Bruce-Page Government would have been,37
NA,severely criticized by the members of the,37
NA,"Labour party, who were then in Opposi-",37
NA,tion ; yet some of those same honorable,37
NA,members now seem to think that such a,37
NA,practice is quite right.,37
NA,I have said on other occasions in this,37
NA,"House, though i t was not popular to do",37
NA,"so, that our expenditure under the",37
NA,"federal aid roads scheme should, iu",37
NA,"present circumstances, be greatly reduced.",37
NA,I know that some honorable members of,37
NA,"the Opposition, who represent country",37
NA,"electorates, disagree with my views on",37
NA,"this subject, They regard expenditure on",37
NA,main roads as essential in the interests,37
NA,of the primary producers. Generally I,37
NA,"do not disagree with this view, and equally",37
NA,desire to see good roads in the country.,37
NA,Yet i f in my own garden I could not,37
NA,afford ironite paths I should have to be,37
NA,"satisfied with something less costly, and,",37
NA,"similarly, I consider that as we cannot",37
NA,afford to lay down expensive concrete,37
NA,"highways, which are used in competition",37
NA,"with Our railways, we should he content",37
NA,"to put down less expensive roads, for the",37
NA,time being at any rate.,37
NA,An amount was provided i n the first,37
NA,budget for the repatriation of excess coal-,37
NA,miners. This money has not yet been,37
NA,"speut, and I do not think that any hard-",37
NA,ship would be done to any one i f the,37
NA,spending of i t were deferred for a con-,37
NA,"siderable time, i f not altogether.",37
NA,1 have referred previously to the,37
NA,extended holiday which the honorable,37
NA,member for Reid ( Mr Coleman) is en-,37
NA,joying at the expense of this country. His,37
NA,absence from Australia for such a pro-,37
NA,tracted period is neither more nor less,37
NA,"than a public scandal, which the Govern-",37
NA,ment should not have allowed to occur.,37
NA,I t is said that he did good work at the,37
NA,"meetings of the League of Nations, but",37
NA,according to the reports of those meet-,37
NA,ings he was unable to answer many of,37
NA,the questions put to him. I t would,37
NA,appear that the honorable member proved,37
NA,himself to he quite incompetent,37
NA,for the work required of him.,37
NA,A Minister acquainted with the,37
NA,"administration of the territories, and",37
NA,able to answer any questions that might,37
NA,"be put to him, should have attended",37
NA,the meetings of the League. One report,37
NA,of the League meetings states-,37
NA,Mr Coleman was subjected to considerable,37
NA,questioning in regard to matters concerning,37
NA,the administrative service in the territory.,37
NA,"At the request of Lord Lugard (Britain), he",37
NA,said that he would have included in the next,37
NA,report particulars of the numbers and rate,37
NA,of pay of each grade of officers so as to dis-,37
NA,tinguish the administrative staff from the,37
NA,technical staff.,37
NA,Replying to another question by Lord,37
NA,"Lugard, Mr Coleman said ""he could",37
NA,not give any details as to the nature of,37
NA,"the proposed scheme, without reference",37
NA,"to his Prime Minister."" Lord Lugard",37
NA,also asked whether Mr Coleman was,37
NA,satisfied royalty was sufficiently high to,37
NA,meet the expenditure on the gold-,37
NA,"fields."" Mr Coleman said he was",37
NA,not in a position to indicate what,37
NA,the future lines of 'government policy,37
NA,might be.,37
Mr A GREEN ,I f the honorable mem-,38
NA,ber had a full -report of the meetings of,38
NA,"the League, he would see that the honor-",38
NA,able member for Eeid ( Mr Coleman),38
NA,made a. most informative speech.,38
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,,38
NA,No man should be sent to the meetings,38
NA,of the League unless he has a full know-,38
NA,"ledge of the subjects to be dealt with,",38
NA,and is able to satisfy the representatives,38
NA,of other nations that Australia is properly,38
NA,administering the territories over which,38
NA,"she has a mandate. Obviously, the Tumor*",38
NA,able member for Eeid could not give those,38
NA,"assurances, and, therefore, apart from the",38
NA,"question of cost, his representation of",38
NA,Australia can only be regarded as un-,38
NA,satisfactory.,38

NA,honorable member for Eeid-*-a man with-,38

NA,brilliant qualities should b'e . at the dis-,38
NA,posal of the Government in Australia in,38
NA,these critical times.,38
Mr ANSTEY ,Member s of the Opposi-,38
NA,tion unanimously agreed that the,38
NA,Attorney-General should go abroad.,38
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,. 1,38
NA,did not say so. I aim now 'exercising my,38
NA,right to protest against his long absence,38
NA,from Australia.,38
NA,Mr C. RILEY -Th e honorable mem-,38
NA,ber attacks the Attorney-General behind,38
NA,his back.,38
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , 1,38
NA,am not attacking the Attorney-General,38
NA,behind his back; as a public man I am,38
NA,entitle'd to voice my protest against his,38
NA,absence from Australia at this time.,38
NA,Having carried out the work which he,38
NA,was appointed to do at the Assembly of,38
NA,"the League of Nations, the Attorney-",38
NA,General should have returned to Aus-,38
NA,tralia instead bf careering round the,38
NA,countryside of England at a time when,38
NA,Australia can ill-afford the expenditure,38
NA,that is being incurred.,38
NA,Before leaving Australia the Prime,38
NA,Minister said that he would not return,38
NA,empty-handed; but so far there is little,38
NA,evidence pf his having achieved anything,38
NA,worth while. All he seems to have,38
NA,accomplished is to have gained the sym-,38
NA,pathy of the people of England because,38
NA,of the actions of his colleagues in his,38
NA,absence. The Government's attempts at,38
NA,For economy are a byword. I t has hot ma'de,38
NA,an honest attempt to reduce expenditure:,38
NA,it has uot been untrammelled by political,39
NA,"considerations, otherwise ir could bave",39
NA,"saved at least £4,000,000.",39
NA,A study of the Government's taxation,39
NA,proposals suggests that it has sought the,39
NA,most cruel form of taxation to impose on,39
NA,tlie workers of Australia. In one year it,39
NA,"expects to take £44,000,000 out of the",39
NA,"pockets of a little over 6,000,000 people",39
NA,by means of customs duties. It has also,39
NA,imposed a tax on tea. I can imagine,39
NA,with what joy the announcement of this,39
NA,tax was received by many persons in the,39
NA,community. I fancy that I can hear the,39
NA,applause of the workers in Brunswick and,39
NA,other industrial centres of the Common-,39
NA,"wealth, when Labour members tell their",39
NA,"constituents that, in addition to taxing",39
NA,"their beer and tobacco, the Government,",39
NA,lias imposed a tax of 4d. or 6d. per lb.,39
NA,on the family tea. The sales tax,39
NA,has also been increased as a means of,39
NA,getting the country out of its financial,39
NA,difficulties. The presence in the chamber,39
NA,of the honorable member for South,39
NA,Sydney ( Mr E. Riley) reminds me of a,39
NA,sxieech he made in the recent election,39
NA,"campaign in New South Wales, in which",39
NA,he told the electors that the Federal Go-,39
NA,vernment would have the courage to in-,39
NA,crease the sales tax. He did not tell them,39
NA,that that tax was directed at those at the,39
NA,base of the pyramid-the workers-while,39
NA,the more wealthy sections of the com-,39
NA,"munity, at the apex of the pyramid,",39
NA,would be unaffected by it. Nor did. he tell,39
NA,the electors that the Government which,39
NA,had tho courage to increase the sales,39
NA,tax was not game to reduce tho,39
NA,allowances of members of Parliament. A,39
NA,few weeks ago the honorable member for,39
NA,"Macquarie ( Mr Chifley), speaking ou",39
NA,"the solidarity of the Labour caucus, said",39
NA,that nothing in the civilized world is,39
NA,equal to this expression of human en-,39
NA,deavour which is so solid and united. Yet,39
NA,within a week that magnificent structure,39
NA,"which he called upon every one to admire,",39
NA,was tottering on its foundations.,39
NA,hear of divisions with twenty ayes and,39
NA,sixteen noes. The whole of this morning,39
NA,was spent by the caucus in watering down,39
NA,a previous motion to make it so in-,39
NA,nocuous that no one can understand it.,39
NA,The Government's taxation proposals will,39
NA,"hit the worker hardest of all, and will",39
NA,vent the downward trend in the cost of,39
NA,living. The taxation imposed by this,39
NA,Mr Archdale Parkhill.,39
NA,Government is so heavy that I do not,39
NA,know how the workers outside those in,39
NA,the sheltered industries will he able to,39
NA,carry on. One of the undertakings given,39
NA,by the Oommonwealth Government at,39
NA,the Melbourne conference was that the,39
NA,Commpnwealth would not further en-,39
NA,croach on. the field of taxation which,39
NA,rightly belonged to the States. Thu Act-,39
NA,ing Treasurer's ( Mr Lyons) financial,39
NA,statement included this paragraph-,39
NA,Tin; now income tax proposals relate prin-,39
NA,cipally to income from property. The object,39
NA,"aimed at is an increase in property taxation,",39
NA,"which, with increases by the States, w i ll",39
NA,result in property bearing a fair burden in,39
NA,the pJau of budget re-adjustment.,39
NA,"Clearly, this amended budget is an infrac-",39
NA,tion of the Melbourne undertaking; i t,39
NA,proposes a shattering inroad on the,39
NA,States' domain of taxation. The honor-,39
NA,able gentleman further stated that the,39
NA,"new proposals "" are designed so as to",39
NA,spread the aftditional burdens equitably,39
NA,over the whole community without un-,39
NA,duly eutering the fields of taxation on,39
NA,"which the States rely "". Are we to infer",39
NA,that i n addition to the imposts which,39
NA,"this Government now threatons, the States",39
NA,also are to increase their income taxes?,39
NA,"I f that happens, the country will he in",39
NA,a. desperate state. Already the Govern-,39
NA,ment has found that the last increases of,39
NA,duties on beer and spirits have reduced,39
NA,"instead of increasing the revenue, and",39
NA,they cannot proceed further in that field,39
NA,without risking an undue sacrifice of,39
NA,income. That is true also of tobacco and,39
NA,other heavily taxed commodities. The,39
NA,"limit of taxation has been reached, and it",39
NA,is time that the Government realized that,39
NA,Australia cannot be taxed into prosperity.,39
NA,I have never heard of a more unfair,39
NA,proposal than that relating to the tax on,39
NA,income from property. The Government,39
NA,"proposes to raise an additional £1,500 000",39
NA,"from income tax, the bulk of which will",39
NA,come from the most deserving class in,39
NA,We the community-th e thrifty people of,39
NA,small incomes. The exemption of income,39
NA,from property is to be reduced from £3CO,39
NA,"to £100, and will disappear entirely when",39
NA,the taxable income reaches £200. Cn,39
NA,"such income, the Government proposes",39
NA,to levy a further tax of 1 \ per cent. Th.U,39
NA,"premeans that the small property-owner, who",39
NA,"by industry, rigid thrift, and stern self-",39
NA,"denial, has saved a few thousand pounds,",39
NA,w hile his neighbour has been punting his,40
NA,money away ou the racecourse and wast-,40
NA,"ing it on pianolas and motor cars, is, in",40
NA,"lu's old age, to be taxed into penury.",40
NA,Tlie Acting Treasurer hypocritically,40
NA,"All fixed income from property, including",40
NA,"interest, is in a relatively better position",40
NA,day than last year hecuusc of reduced com-,40
NA,"modity prices. I n these circumstances, income",40
NA,from property may fairly be required to pro-,40
NA,vide more taxation.,40
NA,Is that not true also of public servants,40
NA,in receipt of salaries of less than £725,40
NA,"per annum, and of unionists in sheltered",40
NA,"industries who.se wages are at the peak,",40
NA,while their fellow unionists are struggling,40
NA,for a crust? The Government's proposal,40
NA,"will mean that a widow, who has an in-",40
NA,"come of £200 from bonds and property,",40
NA,will be required to pay as much inco'i';,40
NA,tax as a man in receipt of a salary of,40
NA,£750.,40
Dr MALONEY ,I t is not just.,40
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , I t is,40
NA,"not, and tbe Labour party should not",40
NA,sr.and for such inequality. A person with,40
NA,an annual income of £300 from property,40
NA,"will pay £29 8s. 4d., whilst a man with",40
NA,"a salary of £1,000 a year will pay only",40
NA,£34 10s. 3d. Such inequalities cannot be,40
NA,justified. Many people with a small in-,40
NA,come from investments have little or no,40
NA,margin above the amount sufficient to,40
NA,maintain them; they are too proud to,40
NA,"lean on the State, but because they have",40
NA,won a bare competence an additional,40
NA,12s. 6d. per week is to be extorted from,40
NA,rhem. What encouragement is there for,40
NA,people to provide for their old age instead,40
NA,of relying on pensions and other forms,40
NA,of eleemosynary aid ? I t is little wonder,40
NA,that the number of applicants for the old-,40
NA,age pension is increasing and that it3,40
NA,annual cost to the country is mounting,40
NA,steadily. I protest emphatically against,40
NA,this injustice to a most deserving class.,40
NA,People have been advised to inculcate into,40
NA,the minds of their families the principles,40
NA,of thrift and independence. The Com-,40
NA,monwealth Bank employs a most talented,40
NA,"woman, Miss Janet Mitchell, to lecture",40
NA,on thrift and encourage people to make,40
NA,provision for their old age. Its banking,40
NA,"chambers are placarded ""Buy a bond;",40
NA,"look after your old age"". When people",40
NA,act on that precept instead'of leaning on,40
NA,"the Government, they are threatened with",40
NA,"punitive taxation. The thrifty folk, who",40
NA,"mostly comprise tho middle classes, are",40
NA,the best assets to the nation. The wealthy,40
NA,people can look after their own interests;,40
NA,"I hold no brief for them, although I be-",40
NA,"lieve they are entitled to justice, and 1",40
NA,shall see that they get it. I have no con-,40
NA,"to- cern for the waster who will not work,",40
NA,"otherwise than finding him work to do,",40
NA,but I am concerned with the thrifty class,40
NA,who are being deliberately plundered by,40
NA,the present Government. This penal taxa-,40
NA,"tion is wrong. Over 80 per cent, of the",40
NA,workers are dependent upon private em-,40
NA,ployers. How is employment to expand,40
NA,under constantly increasing taxation ? If,40
NA,by taxation the Government takes all,40
NA,"profits out of industry, how are the un-",40
NA,employed to be absorbed? This taxation,40
NA,system is economically unsound and un-,40
NA,"statesmaiilike, anct it arises from the",40
NA,failure of the Government to shoulder,40
NA,the responsibility of reducing the cost of,40
NA,administration. If it had had the courage,40
NA,to reduce expenditure to the point of hurt-,40
NA,"ing, the finances would be on a better",40
NA,basis. But with the exception of a few,40
NA,unprotected non-unionists in the Defence,40
NA,"Department, nobody is seriously affected",40
NA,or worried by the Government's economy,40
NA,proposals. Tlie truth is that no real,40
NA,economy is being practised. As recently,40
NA,ns the 30th October the Sydney Sun re-,40
NA,ported that the Prime Minister ( Mr.,40
NA,"Scullin) had said, in the course of a",40
NA,"radio-telephone conversation with the""",40
NA,"Acting Prime Minister, that the financial",40
NA,"position in London was most difficult, and",40
NA,stressed the necessity for adhering to the,40
NA,programme laid down at tlie Melbourne,40
NA,conference. Because the Government has,40
NA,"lacked the courage to do that, and because",40
NA,of its general incapacity to stand up to its,40
NA,"job, the Commonwealth is in a serious",40
NA,"financial depression, and there is little",40
NA,hope of financial and economic salvation,40
NA,from the present Administration.,40
NA,"Sitting suspended from, 6.IS to 8 p.m.",40
Mr CURTIN ,Premantle) [8.0] -On e,40
NA,readily recognizes that the session that,40
NA,has been summoned on this occasion has,40
NA,to deal with about the most important,40
NA,economic problem Australia has yet,40
NA,"faced; and I should have, imagined",40
NA,"that the Opposition, which has a",40
NA,history to answer for in connexion,40
NA,"with this problem, would rather",40
NA,have faced the future than - have,41
NA,concentrated as it were the whole of its,41
NA,criticism upon what it alleges to be the,41
NA,sins of omission of the present Govern-,41
NA,ment during the last few months. T,41
NA,doubt i f political audacity has even been,41
NA,"greater than in the case of men,",41
NA,"who, in a period of unprecedented",41
NA,difficulty and acute depression-,41
NA,"when, as they say, the national",41
NA,"income has fallen by about £150,000,000,",41
NA,when the prices of our principal staples,41
NA,have been almost cut in half and when,41
NA,the revenues of the Government have been,41
NA,depleted and inevitable expenditure,41
NA,increased-hav e the hardihood to expect,41
NA,an achievement which they themselves,41
NA,failed to accomplish during years of com-,41
NA,parative industrial opulence. They failed,41
NA,to balance their budgets when prices were,41
NA,"high, when the national income was",41
NA,"buoyant, when the industries of. the",41
NA,country were comparatively prosperous,41
NA,and when the great majority of the people,41
NA,were employed. I f they have a policy,41
NA,it surely involves putting the past,41
NA,"behind them and, instead of hold-",41
NA,"ing, inquests on what has been done",41
NA,"by others, to look to the future to",41
NA,"discover, i f possible, means by which the",41
NA,present position may be rectified. We,41
NA,could then engage as a sort of economic,41
NA,council in a dispassionate examination of,41
NA,the question. But the speech of the,41
NA,Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham),41
NA,"this afternoon, far from suggesting any-",41
NA,thing towards elucidating the problem or,41
NA,"discovering solutions for it, was rather",41
NA,directed towards converting the com-,41
NA,munity towards the political standard,41
NA,which he himself holds up. I t was a,41
NA,"speech delivered, as I beard it, with a",41
NA,view to vote-winning rather than to,41
NA,problem-solving.,41
NA,There can be no question that,41
NA,the whole of the utterances of repre-,41
NA,sentative leaders of the party oppo-,41
NA,"site during the last, few weeks have",41
NA,been directed very largely towards,41
NA,endeavouring to throw the whole onus,41
NA,of the present situation on the present,41
NA,"Government and its supporters, rather",41
NA,than io presenting the facts in their,41
NA,entirety so. that the public might realize,41
NA,clearly that this problem is not innate to,41
NA,"Australia, but is one that has arisen",41
NA,"because, shall I say, of the financial bank-",41
NA,Sfr. (Purlin.,41
NA,ruptcy of civilization. There is not a,41
NA,country in the world irrespective of,41
NA,whether it can or cannot for the moment,41
NA,obtain budget equilibrium that is not,41
NA,faced with economic difficulties almost,41
NA,identical with those confronting the,41
NA,people of Australia.,41
Mr GREGORY ,Tha t is not so.,41
Mr CURTIN ,I t is. Whether,41
NA,"a country has one policy or another,",41
NA,in the major sense the mass of its,41
NA,people are suffering because of the,41
NA,impossibility of marketing their pro-,41

NA,the United States of America equally,41
NA,"wijh Great Britain, and to Germany",41
NA,"equally with Belgium, and it applies to",41
NA,Australia. Our difiiculties are due not,41
NA,to auy physical impairment of our pro-,41
NA,ductive apparatus; they have not arisen,41
NA,because of any slothfulness on the part,41
NA,"of our people. Indeed, almost parodoxi-",41
NA,cally it may be said that at no other time,41
NA,in the history of this continent has the,41
NA,production of the soil been so bountiful,41
NA,as it is at the present moment; yet it,41
NA,remains a tragic commentary upon tlm,41
NA,situation that this abundance of nature,41
NA,which has been fructified by man's,41
NA,industry aud genius has contributed,41
NA,nothing towards the solution of our diffi-,41

Dr MALONEY ,'An d people are,41
NA,starving.,41
Mr CURTIN ,I n the midst of,41
NA,"plenty, there are, as the honorable mem-",41
NA,"ber says, many people who are starving.",41
NA,There are two groups of problems.,41
NA,There is the problem of Governmental,41
NA,"finance, the problem of managing",41
NA,the affairs of the nation as a sort of,41
NA,"national executive, and there is deeper",41
NA,"than that, and largely responsible",41
NA,"for it, the problem of the effec-",41
NA,tive and profitable employment of the,41
NA,resources of the people. I t is my judg-,41
NA,ment for what it is worth that there can,41
NA,"be no budgetary equilibrium in Australia,",41
NA,either for the Commonwealth or the,41
NA,"States, so long as 200,000 of our people",41

NA,incapable of carrying on effectively.,41
Mr NAIRN ,Wha t is the remedy?,41
Mr GREGORY ,T o take more money,41
NA,from the people.,41
Mr CURTIN ,Tha t is a rather,41
NA,"cheap kind of sneer, because i f honorable",41
NA,"members challenge me on the point, I shall",42
NA,cite chapter and verse for the extra-,42
NA,ordinary increases in revenue which the,42
NA,previous Government extracted from the,42
NA,people of this country; I shall point out,42
NA,"that, whether through indirect or direct",42
NA,"taxation, our predecessors inherited a cer-",42
NA,"i.ain revenue, and till they did each year",42
NA,was to innate it and meet every problem',42
NA,either by not paying their way or by ex-,42
NA,r-ructing more revenue from the people,42
NA,and industries of this continent. Honor-,42
NA,able members need not challenge me on,42
NA,i.lie point; the testimony is there for who-,42
NA,ever likes to look at it. The last two,42
NA,budgets presented by the Nationalist,42
NA,"Government showed deficits, so that the",42
NA,"dishonour, which it is said by the Opposi-",42
NA,tion to attach to this party because of,42
NA,its inability to meet the expenditure,42
NA,"out of revenue, is one that attaches to",42
NA,themselves. I f to fail to pay,42
NA,one's way each year is a cardinal,42
NA,offence against national honour the,42
NA,Labour party is not the initiators of this,42
NA,chapter of obloquy in the national his-,42
NA,tory. I t has been written by othera in,42
NA,ci rcjumstances less justifiable than the,42
NA,present.,42
NA,The Leader of the Opposition in bis,42
NA,amendment suggests that all would be,42
NA,right i f we were to adopt and carry into,42
NA,"legislative, effect the programme con-",42
NA,"sidered by the Premiers in August, last",42
NA,at a conference at which Sir Otto Nie-,42
NA,meyer was present. I have some figures,42
NA,"showing the result of the first four months,",42
NA,operations of the States and the Common-,42
NA,"wealth, and the deficits of the Common-",42
NA,wealth and the States at the end of Octo-,42
NA,ber. I f it be a tribute to certain Premiers,42
NA,that they have agreed on paper to the,42
NA,establishment of budgetary equilibrium,42
NA,for their States we are entitled to ask,42
NA,how far the performance squares with the,42
NA,declaration of intent. At the end of the,42
NA,first four months' operations of the present,42
NA,financial year the States showed the fol-,42

NA,things referred to by the honorable mem-,42
NA,ber for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Park-,42

NA,something that shines out as a bright light,42
NA,in contradistinction to the manner in,42
NA,which the Commonwealth Government is,42
NA,behaving-hav e as a result of the first four,42
NA,montlis' operations of the current,42

Mr CURTIN ,"It . is £5,900,000 on",42
NA,four months' operations. I ask honor-,42
NA,able members to put the question fairiy,42
NA,to themselves-i n what respect is the,42
NA,"August agreement, which apparently has",42
NA,become a sort of Ten Commandments for,42
NA,"the Governments oi Australia, being",42
NA,observed hy the States? They are in,42
NA,"the cleft, stick of financial, embarrass-",42
NA,ment just the same as the Commonwealth.,42
NA,"They find that, however well intentioned",42
NA,"may have been their promises, every step",42
NA,they take along the road of the Niemeyer,42
NA,plan makes it increasingly difficult for,42
NA,them to realize their financial expecta-,42
NA,"tions. Every reduction in wages, every",42
NA,"rationing in employment, every diminu-",42
NA,tion in the purchasing power of the com-,42
NA,"munity, reacts upon the taxpaying capa-",42
NA,"city, and as a result the revenues which",42
NA,"have been forecast b3 the Treasurers,",42
NA,r,42
NA,"Commonwealth or State, have not been,",42
NA,and will not be. realized. A l l the talk,42
NA,that there was a sort of sacred covenant,42
NA,"entered into in Melbourne last August,",42
NA,and which this Government is the one ig-,42
NA,noble administration in Australia to dis-,42
NA,"honor, falls absolutely to the ground",42
NA,in the face of the reality. The,42
NA,"reality is that, whatever be their,",42
NA,"intentions or their readiness t,o",42
NA,subscribe to the conception of budgetary,42
NA,"adjustment, the facts have not permitted",42
NA,the Treasurers' budgets to be adjusted.,42
NA,While i t may be argued in a most so-,42
NA,phistical way that the first two or tln-pe,42
NA,months of the financial year are always,42
NA,"the worst, that the income tax assess-^",42
NA,"ments have not been issued, and that",42
NA,there is a piling up of arrears from the,42
NA,previous year as a result of certain hook-,42
NA,"keeping arrangements, the first three",42
NA,months of this year in comparison with,42
NA,the first three months of any previous,43
NA,year prove to be by far the worst from,43
NA,the stand-point of budget equation.; and,43
NA,"I say, quite frankly, that I see no expecta-",43
NA,tion of the finances ofthe Oommonwealth,43
NA,or the States being adjusted on an even,43
NA,keel in the next twelve months.,43
NA,The problem that confronts us has taken,43
NA,years to grow. From 1914 Australian,43
NA,governmental finance has been compli-,43
NA,cated and embarrassed by. the tremendous,43
NA,piling up of interest charges. Of the tax-,43
NA,ation estimated to be collected this year,43
NA,by the Federal and State Govern-,43
NA,"ments, 62 per cent, will be paid",43
NA,"in interest, and sinking fund charges.",43
NA,Ouo of every pound which,43
NA,Railways Commissioners of,43
NA,Commonwealth and the States collect,43
NA,"in rates and fares, 7s. is paid in interest",43
NA,and sinking fund charges. While this,43
NA,terrific incursion into the ordinary,43
NA,revenue of the natioif is made for the pur-,43
NA,pose of satisfying the claims of bond-,43
NA,"holders, how can it be expected that any",43
NA,industrial enterprise will pay? And i f,43
NA,industrial enterprises cannot pay-an d,43
NA,what is true of the railways is true of,43
NA,almost every other industrial and produc-,43
NA,tive enterprise in the nation-ho w in the,43
NA,name of common sense is it to be expected,43
NA,"that the nation, which is merely a reflec-",43
NA,tion in a corporate sense of the in-,43
NA,"dividual life of the people, can have",43
NA,its finances adjusted upou an even,43
NA,keel?,43
NA,It is true thut honorable members,43
NA,opposite have a policy. That policy,43
NA,nakedly and unashamedly stated by the,43
NA,honorable member for Warringah ( Mr.,43
NA,"Parkhill), in so far as it affects the public",43
NA,"Bervants, is that he would reduce their",43
NA,salaries by a graduated cut. He would,43
NA,"reduce every one. That remedy, although",43
NA,not likely to contribute towards the,43
NA,rejuvenation of Australia's economic,43
NA,"life, might certainly contribute towards",43
NA,a bookkeeping adjustment of national,43
NA,"finances, and might permit of 70 per",43
NA,"cent, instead of a 62 per cent, share",43
NA,to bond-holders. I do not say that,43
NA,the great financial interests of Australia,43
NA,would not cheerfully endorse and even,43
NA,welcome such a policy. But I put this,43
NA,question to this House and to the country:,43
NA,Are all the problems of nations to be,43
NA,solved by the operation of a policy of,43
NA,Mr Curtin.,43
NA,depressing .the wages of those who ore,43
NA,the poorest of this and every other,43
NA,"community."" . , -- .",43
NA,We were told in the course of the,43
NA,speech of the Leader of the Opposi-,43
NA,tion ( Mr Latham) that there are,43
NA,"those in this community who, apparently,",43
NA,"meeting in a corner of this building,",43
NA,"are recreant, not ouly to their",43
NA,trusteeship as representatives of the,43
NA,"people, but also to any conception of",43
NA,"national decency, that they would repu-",43
NA,diate the obligations of this country in,43
NA,"a variety of ways, and that because of",43
NA,"their overt acts wliich, apparently, com-",43
NA,"menced only this week, it has become",43
NA,impossible to rectify Australia's over-,43
NA,the seas financial position. The truth of this,43
NA,the inatter goes back far beyond any particu-,43
NA,lar meeting held in Canberra this week.,43
NA,The attack upon Australian securities,43
NA,commenced a year ago. The onslaught,43
NA,upon the credit of this country did not,43
NA,originate with any decisions that may or,43
NA,may not have been made in the Labour,43
NA,"caucus, and, after all, international",43
NA,"finance is concerned, not with opinions,",43
NA,"but with facts. With respect to opinions,",43
NA,I suppose that few persons have any,43
NA,great admiration for the political stability,43
NA,of the South American republics. Their,43
NA,policies apparently would not be endorsed,43
NA,"by tho right-thinking, and, shall we say,",43
NA,"influential, statesmen of Europe, hut that",43
NA,does not prevent South America from,43
NA,being a f r u i t f u l field of investment for,43
NA,international capital. I t does not pre-,43
NA,vent the Argentine railways from being,43
NA,built out of funds secured in Europe and,43
NA,for the most part floated on the London,43
NA,stock market. Whatever may be the,43
NA,opinions of Englishmen regarding the,43
NA,"politics of tho South American Republics,",43
NA,the fact remains that so long as those,43
NA,countries are a profitable field of invest-,43
NA,"ment, money is poured into them from",43
NA,nil over the world.,43
Mr MORGAN ,Th e Argentine has,43
NA,-,43
NA,(me,43
NA,of the most conservative governments in,43
NA,the world.,43
Mr CURTIN ,Ther e are conserva-,43
NA,tive governments everywhere. One of,43
NA,the most conservative is the present,43
NA,Federal Government. I n any event the,43
NA,problems of this country are definitely,43
NA,"related to the world problem, which, in",43
NA,"essence, is that productive power on the",43
NA,part of tlie peoples of the world has i,44
NA,greatly outstripped the means of,44
NA,"exchange; i n other words, the",44
NA,available f o r the exchange of goods and,44
NA,services are inadequate when measured on piece-work.,44
NA,by the tremendous mass of goods and,44
NA,services that have to be exchanged.,44
NA,need not cite evidence i n support of that reduced.,44
NA,contention. I simply remind this House,44
NA,that i n 1914 when the great war comable,44
NA,menced there was withdrawn f,44
NA,fields of production i n Great B ritain and,44
NA,other countries not thousands but millions,44
NA,of men who had previously been engaged,44
NA,iu the performance of the industrial,44
NA,vices of civilization. These men went,44
NA,forth to war. They were engaged i n 101,44
NA,"forms of activity, which, from the standable",44
NA,"point of production, could be said to be",44
NA,entirely useless. These men were conmy quotation.,44
NA,sumers instead of producers of goods.,44
NA,"They left behind them, as i t were, a",44
NA,"residuum of labourers who, by reason",44
NA,the stimulus given to production by,44
NA,"the necessities of war, were able so",44
NA,to augment the productive efficiency,44
NA,"of mankind .as to make food, clothf",44
NA,ing and other commodities availmembers,44
NA,"able to civilization, i f not upon the",44
NA,"same standard as before the war,",44
NA,upon a livin g standard. I n addition all,44
NA,the requirements of war were,44
NA,this diminished army of labourers. When,44
NA,the war ended and this enormous army .,44
NA,of men attempted to - return to the fields,44
NA,"and to the workshops, they found that",44
NA,they had to a large extent been supplanted,44
NA,by junior labour and young women who,44
NA,had been trained i n industrial vocations.,44
NA,Their services were not required and,44
NA,there was no place f o r them as labourers.,44
NA,"Then the doctrine was sounded, and its",44
NA,echoes reverberated through this chamber,44
NA,this afternoon that the remedy f o r un-,44
NA,employment was that everybody should,44
NA,"take less, that we should take a retrograde",44
NA,step and bring about a lower standard by,44
NA,asking the workers to work longer hours,44
NA,for less pay.,44
Mr LAZZARINI ,Produc e more and,44
NA,take less.,44
NA,"Mr CURTIN"" -Tha t is what i t",44
NA,amounts to. That is no remedy f o r unemwith,44
NA,ployment. I n fact the remedy is really,44
NA,the opposite direction. Mr .,44
NA,"in his book, M y L i f e and Work, said that",44
NA,f i t ever came to a test whether dividends,44
NA,"should be paid or wages lowered, he would",44
NA,facilities abolish dividends.,44
Mr WHITE , H i s employees were paid,44
Mr CURTIN , Mr Ford did not,44
NA,I even suggest that wages should be,44
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , T h e honor-,44
NA,member is quoting only one section,44
NA,r o m the of what Mr Ford said.,44
Mr CURTIN ,Th e honorable mem-,44
NA,ber is himself an adept at picking out,44
NA,particular allusions to reinforce his argu-,44
NA,serments. I submit that i n quoting Mr .,44
NA,"Ford, I have not misrepresented his",44
NA,general conclusions and u n t i l the honor',44
NA,member f o r Warringah can show,44
NA,"that I have, he has no right to challenge",44
NA,I now come to a consideration of the,44
NA,of position of Australia. First of all the,44
NA,existing depression has been brought,44
NA,about mainly because the enormous in*,44
NA,pouring of loan funds into this country,44
NA,r o m overseas has ceased. Honorable,44
NA,opposite have lived on overseas,44
NA,loans during the whole period of their,44
NA,at least political existence.,44
Mr GULLETT , W h a t of the State,44
NA,provided by Labour Governments?,44
Mr CURTIN , I am dealing with,44
NA,the Commonwealth as a whole and not,44
NA,"with individual States. Furthermore,",44
NA,were i t not f o r the fact that these loans,44
NA,were regularly available to meet Austra-,44
NA,"lia's overseas obligations, this financial",44
NA,crisis which now faces Australia would,44
NA,have developed years before. I t has,44
NA,emerged f o r three reasons. I t is not un-,44
NA,associated with the political changes that,44
NA,have taken place in Australia. There are,44
NA,tliose overseas who detest and fear the,44
NA,advent of Labour Governments i n Aus-,44
NA,tralia.,44
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , T h e y have,44
NA,every reason to fear Labour - Govern-,44
NA,ments.,44
Mr CURTIN ,The y fear them,44
NA,because they know that Labour Govern-,44
NA,ments are concerned more with the well-,44
NA,being of the people of this country than,44
NA,the appreciation of the fixed i n -,44
NA,i n comes of those who have invested i n go-,44
NA,"Henry Eord, vernment, securities.",44

Mr MAXWELL ,Tha t means repudia-,45

Mr GULLETT ,Pu t it in plain English.,45
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Norman,45
NA,Makin) --Order !,45
Mr CURTIN ,I t is no use honor-,45
NA,able members on that side dodging issues,45
NA,that are bound to be raised throughout,45
NA,the country. I say frankly that I do not,45
NA,"regard the claims of bond-holders, either",45
NA,"inside or outside of Australia, as superior",45
NA,to those of the men and women who are,45
NA,engaged in the industries and productive,45
NA,enterprises of this country.,45
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Ar e their,45
NA,claims equal?,45
Mr CURTIN ,Th e honorable mem-,45
NA,ber can reason that out for himself.,45
NA,Every step that has been taken i n recent,45
NA,"years, more"" particularly since the partial",45
NA,"revival of the gold standard in Europe,",45
NA,"has had as its effect, i f not its purpose,",45
NA,the appreciation of the value of the stock,45
NA,held by bond-holders in Australia.,45
Mr FRANCIS ,Tli e value of stocks has,45
NA,fallen.,45
Mr CURTIN ,Tha t is not so. I t is,45
NA,pointed out that every fall i n prices has,45
NA,the effect of increasing the purchasing,45
NA,power of the incomes of those who have,45
NA,titles to the public debt.,45
Mr LATHAM ,An d of all persons on -,45
NA,fixed payments.,45
Mr CURTIN ,"Tha t may be so, but Mr SPEAKER -Order !",45
NA,the number of those in receipt of fixed,45
NA,wage payments in Australia is not very,45
NA,large.,45
Mr LATHAM ,I t includes the Comwas,45
NA,monwealth public servants.,45
Mr CURTIN , I f we are to arrive at,45
NA,"right conclusions, i t is necessary to keep",45
NA,distinct the valuation to be placed,45
NA,income derived from property or investgovernmental,45
NA,ments as against that to be placed on,45
NA,income derived from personal exertion.,45
NA,"I say, definitely, that in respect of",45
NA,policy of taxation that is submitted to,45
NA,this House I shall always endeavour to,45
NA,ensure that its incidence falls most,45
NA,heavily upon those who derive incomes,45
NA,without personal exertion.,45
Mr GULLETT ,I t always has.,45
Mr CURTIN ,The n what is the honlong,45
NA,orable member growling about?,45
Mr GULLETT ,-Taxatio n is being in-,45
NA,"creased to "" save the skins "" of public ser-",45
NA,vants who belong to unions.,45
NA,Mr CURTIN' - I feel certain that the,45
NA,Deputy Leader of the Opposition would,45
NA,pay his intelligence a compliment i f he,45
NA,refrained from interjecting for ten,45
NA,minutes. C say candidly that the whole,45
NA,"policy, which is rooted i n the Niemeyer",45
NA,"philosophy, means two things.",45
Mr GULLETT ,"I t means ""pay our",45
NA,"debts "".",45
Mr CURTIN ,-Eve n to keep silent,45
NA,for ten minutes is apparently too great a,45
NA,task for the Deputy Leader of the Opposi-,45
NA,"tion. This policy, as I understand it..",45
NA,"involves, first, a deflation of all incomes",45
NA,"in Australia, except those derived from",45
NA,investments in government stocks.,45
NA,"Secondly, i t means that because of the",45
NA,"fall in prices, and the consequential fall",45
NA,"in the national revenue, an increasing",45
NA,proportion of the national revenue must,45
NA,be diverted towards meeting the charges,45
NA,incidental to the national debt.,45
Mr LATHAM ,Wha t does the honor-,45
NA,able member intend to do about it?,45
Mr CURTIN , I shall come to that,45
NA,"later. Mr J. M . Keynes, i n his work,",45
NA,The Economic Reconstruction of Europe.,45
NA,says that there comes a point when the,45
NA,problem of meeting the national debt i?,45
NA,insoluble by orthodox methods.,45
Mr GULLETT ,Wha t is the honorable,45
NA,member suggesting?,45
Mr CURTIN ,Judgin g by the inter-,45
NA,jections of the Deputy Leader of the,45
NA,Opposition one would imagine that this,45
NA,an assembly of the honorable ladies,45
NA,of the Australian Women's National,45
NA,League - The essence of the governmental,45
NA,difficulty in Australia to-day is entirely,45
NA,upon due to the enormous payments from,45
NA,revenues that are neces-,45
NA,sarily made in meeting our public debt.,45
NA,Mr WHiTE -'-Does that explain the,45
NA,any honorable member's motion in caucus?,45
Mr CURTIN ,I t does not. Neither,45
NA,does it. explain the honorable member's,45
NA,presence in this chamber. So long as,45
NA,these enormous demands are made upon,45
NA,the national revenue involving as they do,45
NA,the imposition of tremendous taxation so,45
NA,"will it be impossible to have, an",45
NA,economic re-adjustment in Australia.,45
NA,"Lord Buckmaster, ex-Chancellor of the",46
NA,"Exchequer, said on 3rd January of this",46

NA,The war debts are crushing us all. The;,46
NA,should be reviewed with a view to tlieir,46

NA,next week and take the text of this,46
NA,quotation with h i m : The Financial News,46
NA,in its issue of 20th October said,46
NA,fditorially-,46
NA,The best of economists see clearly the,46
NA,inevitability of a re-arrangement of war and,46
NA,reparation debts. They stand in the way of,46
NA,world recovery and must bulk larger as time,46
NA,passes.,46
NA,They have reached that stage in Great,46

NA,lias to be employed this year i n meeting,46

NA,the Commonwealth and the States. I t has,46
NA,to be recognized that i f our tax income,46
NA,"reaches any point below £55,000,000 wc",46
NA,must default i n our payments to bond-,46
NA,"holders. I f we collect only £55,000,000",46
NA,in taxation what is to become of the,46
NA,"claims of invalid and old-age pensioners,",46
NA,"of the widows of soldiers, or the payment",46
NA,of services of government. Obviously i f,46

Mr GULLETT ," O h , no!",46
Mr CURTIN ,-Honorabl e members,46

Mr GULLETT ,Wh y does the honor,46
NA,able member not object to Mr Hogan,46
NA,taxing the public servants i n Victoria?,46
Mr SPEAKER ,Hon. Norman M a k i n ) .,46
NA,I have repeatedly called to order certain,46
NA,honorable members who have been per-,46
NA,"sistently interjecting, and i n this respect",46
NA,the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,46
NA,( Mr Gullett) has been very prominent.,46
NA,I ask honorable members not to offend,46
NA,"again, otherwise I shall be compelled to",46
NA,take further action. Honorable members,46
NA,should realize that the debate cannot be,46
NA,carried on satisfactorily i f such conduct,46
NA,is permitted.,46
Mr CURTIN , I t has been said that,46
NA,the Labour party in essence stands for,46
NA,a gross and deliberate inflation of the,46
NA,note issue as against any proposal to,46
NA,reduce wages-tha t i f given the choice,46
NA,between the two proposals the supporters,46
NA,of the Government favour inflation of the,46
NA,note issue.,46
Mr LATHAM ,"Obviously , that is true.",46
NA,Eepudiation is favoured by some honor-,46
NA,able members opposite.,46
Mr CURTIN ," Mr E . C. Dyasou,",46
NA,who collaborated with Professors Brigden,46
NA,and Copland and Mr C. H . Wickens i n,46
NA,preparing a treatise on the Australian,46
NA,"tariff, at the request of the Government",46
NA,of which the Leader of the Opposition was,46
NA,"a member, has said-",46
NA,The Australian currency stands as tlie most,46
NA,stable of the currencies in the world in recent,46
NA,.years.,46
NA,"He further says, iu connexion with the",46
NA,process of deflation which is put forward,46
NA,and which i n essence is involved abso-,46
NA,"lutely in the process of wage-cutting,",46
NA,that rapid inflation and deflation of the,46
NA,purchasing-power of money are mis-,46
NA,chievous. He continues-,46
NA,The present programme of attempting to,46
NA,increase the purchasing-power of our money,46
NA,"by perhaps 30 per cent, (for the ludicrous",46
NA,reason that tlie Bank of France won't behave,46
NA,"itself) is us mischievous, and may be as",46
NA,damaging to the social fabric as the opposite,46
NA,"of policy, advocated by the Reds, of wholesale",46
NA,inflation.,46
Mr GREGORY ,Wha t does he say con-,46
NA,"cerning, a reduction of salaries by 10 per",46
Mr CURTIN ,Comin g to certain,47
NA,decisions aud resolutions alleged to have,47
NA,"been reached this week, let me point",47
NA,that Mr Dyason says-,47
NA,We do not realize in Australia that,47
NA,doctrine of greater monetary stability,47
NA,become respectable-tha t such men as Mr John,47
NA,"Maynard Keynes, Sir Josiah Stamp, Professor",47
NA,Cassel and Sir Henry Strakosch regard,47
NA,achievement its the outstanding social neces-,47
NA,sity.,47
NA,There is uot a word about wage deflation,47
NA,"there. He then makes this declaration, to",47
NA,which I subscribe and which I regard as,47
NA,the pivot upon which economic equili-,47
NA,brium in Australia can be established. He,47
NA,says-,47
NA,The Board of the Commonwealth Bank can,47
NA,"adopt it to-morrow and, probably, cure within",47
NA,"a reasonable time (say two years) half, but",47
NA,not the whole of our present ills.,47
NA,"The implication in that statement, which",47
NA,I submit for the consideration of honor-,47
NA,"able members, is, in effect, that the Com-",47
NA,monwealth Bank Board has the power to,47
NA,cure within two years one half of the,47
NA,present ills from which the Common-,47
NA,wealth is suffering.,47
Mr GULLETT ,No .,47
Mr CURTIN ,Professo r Brigden,47
NA,stated in a speech delivered in Brisbane,47
NA,on the 22nd October that at present an,47
NA,inflation of the note issue is justified.,47
NA,"Mr Harold Burston, the financial writer",47
NA,"of the Melbourne Herald, remarked last",47
NA,week that under stable conditions a tem-,47
NA,"porary expansion of tbe note issue would,",47
NA,be justified.,47
Mr LATHAM ,Unde r normal condi-,47
NA,tions it is done every year.,47
Mr CURTIN ,Wha t are stable condi-,47
NA,tions?,47
Mr LATHAM ,Norma l conditions.,47
Mr CURTIN , I am entitled to,47
NA,remind honorable' members opposite that,47
NA,"if they had had their way in 1910, 1911",47
NA,"and 1912, just, as they seek to have their",47
NA,"way to-night, there would have been no",47
NA,Commonwealth note issue to-day.,47
NA,remind this Parliament also that if the,47
NA,considered political and financial prin-,47
NA,ciples of honorable members opposite,47
NA,"have remained static, asd if they are the",47
NA,inheritors of the policy of th? Liberal,47
NA,"party, the stand which they -ok in those",47
NA,years would have left the Latiori without,47
NA,the services of a Commonwealth Bank.,47
NA,Thos? honorable members who say that,47
NA,we can cure all our economic diffi-,47
NA,culties by reducing the expenditure of the,47
NA,"out Commonwealth by £4,000,000 do not give",47
NA,any details.,47
the ^ Mr LATHAM ,W e went fully into,47
NA,has details concerning every penny.,47
Mr CURTIN ,Th e position 1ms,47
NA,its changed considerably since then.,47
Mr LATHAM ,Du e to the vacillation,47
NA,of the Government.,47
Mr CURTIN ,Governmenta l expen-,47
NA,diture can be reduced in a variety of,47
NA,ways; but the question is whether the,47
NA,system proposed is right and proper.,47
NA,Everybody recognizes that it is a gospel,47
NA,of perfection to reduce governmental,47
NA,"expenditure, in Australia. Honorable",47
NA,members opposite would reduce our rail-,47
NA,ways expenditure only hy reducing,47
NA,wages. They would not presume to reduce,47
NA,"terest to bondholders. Reduce every one,",47
NA,the national expenditure in every way,47
NA,except by reducing the payments of in-,47
NA,"terest to bondholders. Reduce everyone,",47
NA,they say; but regard the bondholders a?,47
NA,absolutely sacrosanct!,47
NA,Mr .ARCHDALE PARKHILL -Doe s the,47
NA,honorable member say that they should,47
NA,.not get their money?,47
Mr CURTIN , I am not saying any-,47
NA,thing about that.,47
Mr MAXWELL ,Shoul d the people of,47
NA,Australia who borrowed these sums from,47
NA,"the bondholders, and promised, not only",47
NA,"to repay the amount, but also a certain",47
NA,rate of interest during the currency of,47
NA,"the loan, honour that promise?",47
Mr CURTIN ,"Yes , decidedly. We",47
NA,should honour every obligation. We,47
NA,should honour our obligation to every,47
NA,"man and woman in this country, who",47
NA,by virtue of his or her citizenship is,47
NA,entitled to a reasonable subsistence. My,47
NA,reply to the honorable member for,47
NA,Fawkner ( Mr Maxwell) is that i f neces-,47
NA,sity compels a contraction of the public,47
NA,I revenues of this country; i f national con-,47
NA,ditions make it impossible to satisfy all,47
NA,the claims that can properly be lodged,47
NA,"against the nation, should those of",47
NA,bondholders be treated on a differ-,47
NA,"ent basis from those of invalid,",47
NA,+,47
NA,"old-age, and soldier pensioners, and men",47
NA,and women entitled to just wages? Do,47
NA,I understand the honorable member to,47
NA,say that it is right to reduce by statute,47
NA,"the claims of invalid, old-age, and soldier's",48
NA,pensions and those who have the right,48
NA,to wages?,48
NA,Mr MAXWHI.I. -Th e honorable mem-,48
NA,ber is begging the question. The classes,48
NA,mentioned were all parties to the borrow-,48
NA,ing of money. They borrowed the money,48
NA,and made certain promises to repay which,48
NA,ought to be honored.,48
Mr CURTIN , I agree. I put this,48
NA,conception of the case to the honorable,48
NA,NA,48
NA,These persons lent money to the Aus-,48
NA,tralian nation at a time when prices were,48
NA,high and when the purchasing power of,48
NA,their investments was at a given figure. Is,48
NA,"it suggested that, irrespective of what",48
NA,"might happen, these persons are entitled",48
NA,to the ful l speculative value of their,48
NA,investments i f they appreciate?,48
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL , I f wages,48
NA,are fixed when the cost of living is at a,48
NA,"certain figure, does the honorable mem-",48
NA,ber think that they should remain at,48
NA,that rate when the cost of living is re-,48
NA,duced? That'is my answer to the hon-,48
NA,orable member's question.,48
Mr CURTIN ,Th e Leader of the,48
NA,Opposition ( Mr Latham) this afternoon,48
NA,"endeavoured to show that, but for the",48
NA,"policy of this party, the magic wand of",48
NA,Nationalism would be waved in the city,48
NA,"of London, and that our overseas obliga-",48
NA,"tions would be funded. He said, in effect,",48
NA,that so long as there are Labour Govern-,48
NA,"ments in Australia, Australian securities",48
NA,in London will be imperilled and subject,48
NA,"to attack, and that the only way to keep",48
NA,them at par on the London market is to,48
NA,"return him. ""and his colleagues to the",48
NA,ministerial benches. One would imagine,48
NA,that the political opinions of the Aus-,48
NA,tralian people are important factors in,48
NA,determining the flow of capital either to,48
NA,or from Australia. I venture to assert,48
NA,that there are two reasons why Aus--,48
NA,tralian securities have been attacked,48
NA,overseas. Tho first is that a diagnosis of,48
NA,the last seven years of Australian,48
NA,economic history must suggest to the,48
NA,intelligent observer that the country,48
NA,was undeniably drifting in respect,48
NA,to its economic position. I n sup-,48
NA,port of that contention I shall cite,48
NA,"a few facts. First, let us bear",48
NA,in mind that for' about six years wo had,48
NA,an excess of imports over exports to the,48
NA,"extent of over £70,000,000. Secondly, all",48
NA,"our Governments, State and Federal,",48
NA,"were showing deficits, and in addi-",48
NA,tion we were living upon funds bor-,48
NA,rowed overseas amounting annually to,48
NA,"£30,000,000. Then, too, it was patent lo",48
NA,any one who analysed our economic life,48
NA,"that our system of transportation, in",48
NA,which was invested a large portion of the,48
NA,"loans floated by the States, was becoming",48
NA,"unprofitable. Therefore, any keen pene-",48
NA,tration from outside into the fabric of,48
NA,Australian economic life would at once,48
NA,have shown that our position was gradu-,48
NA,ally reaching a state of crisis. Let me,48
NA,"summarize, first from the stand-point of",48
NA,what is termed budget equilibrium.,48
NA,During the time that honorable members,48
NA,opposite were in charge of the affairs of,48
NA,"Australia, our exports wore inferior to",48
NA,"our imports to the extent of £70,000,000,",48
NA,"and in addition, we borrowed annually",48
NA,"for fivo years £30,000,000, or in the aggre-",48
NA,"gate, £150,000,000. The fiscal budgeting",48
NA,"of this nation, therefore, disclosed a",48
NA,"deficiency of £220,000,000.",48
Mr LATHAM ,Thos e figures relate ro,48
NA,both the States and the Commonwealth;,48
NA,there was a very small increase on tlie,48
NA,part of the Commonwealth.,48
Mr CURTIN ,Tha t does uot matter.,48
NA,The financial agreement for which hon-,48
NA,orable gentleman opposite were respon-,48
NA,"sible, and which they forced upon the",48
NA,"country, made it impossible for overseas",48
NA,investors to distinguish between the,48
NA,securities of a. State and the securities of,48
NA,the Commonwealth.,48
Mr LATHAM ,Tha t does not answer,48
NA,the point which has been raised.,48
Mr CURTIN ,"I t does, iu this",48
NA,"respect, that the honorable gentleman to-",48
NA,day talked about financial equilibrium,48
NA,"and tlie balancing of budgets, although",48
NA,during the six years that he and his,48
NA,colleagues occupied the treasury benches,48
NA,of this Commonwealth the nation became,48
NA,indebted to the world to the extent of,48
NA,"£220,000,000.",48
Mr LATHAM ,B y reason of State bor-,48
NA,rowings.,48
Mr CURTIN ,"That , is beside the",48
NA,point. The honorable gentleman says,48
NA,that the attack upon Australian securi-,48
NA,ties is due to the political views of the,48
NA,party that now holds the reins of,48
NA,office. I say that it is bhe natural out-,49
NA,come of fjhe fiscal history of this Com-,49
NA,monwealth duringthe yearsthab honor-,49
NA,able gentlemen opposite were in power.,49
NA,"Tt is due to facts, not to opinions. I t is",49
NA,true that Australia's credit was being,49
NA,attacked. But the cause of that attack,49
NA,"was that our credit was being impaired,",49
NA,"both internally and externally;, externally",49
NA,because we-were gradually getting further,49
NA,"into debt to the rest of the world, and in-",49
NA,ternally because of the influence of new,49
NA,forms of transportation and the enormous,49
NA,overhead cost of .our railways. Our rail-,49
NA,"wayswere not paying, and they had in-",49
NA,vested in thema large part of the loans,49
NA,rhat were floated by the States. I n addi-,49
NA,"tion, the States were showing, deficits.",49
NA,"With the exceptionof one government,, all",49
NA,"the States, as well as the federation,",49
NA,sho.wed deficits in 1-938 and 1929. Is; it,49
NA,"any marvel that, on the facts of the situa-",49
NA,"tion, the London money market came to",49
NA,the conclusion that Australian stocks were,49
NA,not' so reliable an investment as they had,49
NA,"beeu in years gone by, and that the credit",49
NA,of Australia was not so good? I f honor-,49
NA,able members opposite wish to .be,49
NA,"furnished withdetails,. I can give them",49
NA,chapter and verse.,49
NA,I am amazed at thelogical pro-,49
NA,cesses of a mind which imagines,49
NA,that the world comes to a coijr,49
NA,elusion with respect to the financial con-,49
NA,"dition, of a great country as the result of",49
NA,opinions expressed at one or two meetings,49
NA,within the space of a fortnight. The,49
NA,"financial difficulties of thisnation, the",49
NA,"loss, of confidence overseas,, and the accenlative",49
NA,tuation of the problem of public finance,49
NA,"in Australia, are inseparably associated",49
NA,with what happened during the period,49
NA,that the Government which honorable,49
NA,"members opposite supported was in power,",49
NA,amd are the natural and'logical outcome of,49
NA,the improvident policy which their Trea-,49
NA,surer carried into effect. Argue as they,49
NA,"will, those are the facts of the situation-",49
NA,T appeal to the testimony of reality. I,49
NA,"ask, is it true that in a period of six years",49
NA,Australia went behind fiscally to> the tuue,49
NA,"of £70,000,000? Is it true that it bor-",49
NA,"rowed, £30,000,000a year?'",49
Mr LATHAM ,I t is not true.,49
NA,"Mr CURTIN"" - I am, referring to",49
NA,Australia asa whole. The problems with,49
NA,"w,hii;h Australia isfaced to-day-^-the , u-iu-",49
NA,"employment of 2,00^00.0' men,, hightaxa-",49
NA,"tion, the attack upon Australian: securi-",49
NA,"ties, and the fall in our credit level-ar e",49
NA,how attributed to the vacillation of the,49
NA,Ministers whoat present sit upon the,49
NA,treasury bench; but last year and the,49
NA,"year before they were, not attributed' to",49
NA,the Ministers who then held office.. Ac-,49
NA,"cording to the previous Government, the",49
NA,States were then responsible; but accord-,49
NA,"ing to honorable members, opposite, the",49
NA,States are not responsible to-day. That,49
NA,kind of clap-trap would be an insult even,49
NA,to the members of the Australian Women's,49
NA,National League.,49
NA,I have here an interesting editorial,49
NA,note in The Financial R'eviexu of Reviews,49
NA,"and. Investment Survey, of September,",49
NA,"1930. I t deals with certain stocks, whicht",49
NA,I assume include Australian stocks. The,49
NA,opinion of the editor; is given inthefol-,49
NA,lowing terms:-,49
NA,. . . For many months past they have,49
NA,"found i t profitable to "" bear"" almost cuer.y",49

NA,"what an effect these "" bear raids "" have upon",49
NA,"the market. Theoretically, if. a stock is sound,",49
NA,a few points depreciation ought to bring in-,49
NA,"vestors into the market,, but the contrary is-",49
NA,actually the case.. Holders are frightened when,49
NA,"they sec prices falling, and sell, so that when",49
NA,there-has been a long period of falling markets,49
NA,"tlie "" bear, raids "" hayea soiit oE snowball",49

NA,had a. considerable influencein this on-,49
NA,slaught upon thevalue of Australian,49

NA,"I n conclusion, I wish to saya w.ord or",49
NA,"two in regaatd to the future-. Pirst, I",49
NA,would ask. this Parliament to* consider the,49
NA,undesirability of allowing' the banks: to,49

NA,figurethey care to choose.. To begin,49
NA,"with,, thepegging, of exchange by banks in",49
NA,"Australia has not been, done in tlie",49
NA,"intends of Australia, But has. been",49
NA,resorted to simply as av measure of pro-,49

NA,"petition, among themselves*, and to: make",49
NA,ijuore emphatic the tremendous power,50
NA,which they haye exercised upon the life,50
NA,"of this continent, they have arbitrarily",50
NA,pegged tlie rate of exchange at a figure,50
NA,tbat does not square with the ordinary,50
NA,operations of supply and demand.,50
Mr STEWART ,T o the detriment,50
NA,producers and exporters.,50
Mr CURTIN ,A s the honorable,50
NA,member for Wimmera ( Mr Stewart) appropriate word to use.,50
NA,"knows, the producers and exporters are",50
NA,being exploited as a result of the pegging,50
NA,of exchange.,50
Mr GREGORY ,"A t the request, of",50
NA,Government.,50
Mr CURTIN ,Th e Government has,50
NA,had nothing whatever to do with it.,50
NA,a result of legislation passed by the,50
NA,"previous Government, this Government",50
NA,has no power over the monetary policy,50
NA,"of Australia, and cannot interfere with",50
NA,"banking policy. I believe that, instead",50
NA,"of contemplating a budget for one year,",50
NA,it is imperative that the Parliaments of,50
NA,the States aud of the Commonwealth,50
NA,"should contemplate .a much longer period,",50
NA,in order to adjust the finances of,50
NA,nation in the executive sense. An,50
NA,nttempt ought to be made to survey the,50
NA,"position over a period of three, i f not",50
NA,five years. I remind honorable members,50
NA,that the present situation in Australia,50
NA,"been germinating for more than a decade,",50
NA,and that i t has emerged very largely as,50
NA,the result of what has taken place,50
NA,connexion with the charges that have been,50
NA,made for the flotation of loans and,50
NA,enormous demand upon our revenues for,50
NA,the purpose of paying interest. There-,50
NA,"fore, i t cannot be definitely coped with or",50
NA,checked in one year. Any attempt to,50
NA,with i t in that period would be bound to,50
NA,"fail, irrespective of <\Sae complexion of",50
NA,government in power. Honorahle memtime.,50
NA,"bers opposite, i f -they were to attain to",50
NA,"office, would not be able to balance",50
NA,budget this year. The Government that,50
NA,they supported has the ignoble record of,50
NA,deficits -hi years of prosperity. How,50
NA,the name of goodness could they,50
NA,plish in this year of depression what,50
NA,failed to accomplish in years of,50
NA,prosperity ?,50
Mr LATHAM ,"Thi s Government, in",50
NA,"three months, has beaten that record.",50
Mr CURTIN ,^! suggest three courses,50
NA,"to meet the present situation. Firstly,",50
NA,the ba.uks should be compelled to unpeg,50
NA,the exchange and allow i t to operate,50
NA,"naturally, Secondly, the Commonwealtb",50
NA,and State Parliaments should ponteni,50
NA,"plate, i f not afiver-yearperiod, at least",50
NA,"a three-year period, within which to",50
NA,"restore financial equilibrium. Thirdly, J",50
NA,of believe that the Commonwealth Bank,50
NA,Board should be compelled to restore^- -,50
NA,"Mr GOLLKTT.T^- "" Compelled,"" is au",50
Mr CURTIN ,The n I will say thai,50
NA,the Commonwealth Bank Board should,50
NA,"be persuaded, directed or encouraged.",50
NA,the I shall content myself with stating,50
NA,that the board should restore the note,50
NA,issue to the per capita requirements,50
NA,As of the Australian people. I need not,50
NA,go into ihe details. I merely remind,50
NA,honorable memhesns that to-day the note,50
NA,issue is down to nearly £7 per head of,50
NA,"its the population, whereas formerly i t was",50
NA,well oyer £9 per head. I further remind,50
NA,this Parliament that one of the contribut-,50
NA,ing factors in the economic embarrassment,50
NA,of the Commonwealth has been the deli-',50
NA,berate contraction of the note issue by the,50
NA,"the Commonwealth Bank Board. Further,",50
NA,the apparently concerted .endeavour OP,50
NA,the part of the financial institutions and,50
NA,of the large investing industrial elements to,50
NA,deflate wages and commodity prices in,50
NA,has Australia has .caused prices to fall so,50
NA,rapidly that i t has been impassible for,50
NA,industries to check the tremendous .down-,50
NA,i n ward momentum. We cannot hope in a,50
NA,"few months, or even a couple of years, to",50
NA,the retrieve completely the position.,50
Mr MAXWELL ,Wha t does the honor-,50
NA,able member mean by the per capita note,50
NA,cope issue requirements of the nation ?,50
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,H e has,50
NA,the been skirting around the subject all tho,50
Mr CURTIN ,I f the honorable mem-,50
NA,the ber for Warringah ( Mr Archdale Park-,50
NA,hill) will restrain himself and not pose,50
NA,in this House as the sole fountain of wis-,50
NA,"in dom, I shall endeavour to reply to the",50
NA,accomhonorable member for Fawkner. Ap-,50
NA,they parently the honorable member for War-,50
NA,ringah .does not understand the .exact,50
NA,nature of the problems confronting this,50
NA,country. I admit the fallibility of the,50
NA,human mind. I regret my own personal,50
NA,"limitations, and I grieve that .1 am unable",50
NA,to resolve the financial .difficulties con-,50
NA,fronting my country. I n reply to the,50
NA,"honorable member for Fawkner, I may",51
NA,say that for many years the amount of,51
NA,Commonwealth notes customarily in cir-,51
NA,culation was £4 10s. in the hands of the,51
NA,public and £10 in the custody of the,51
NA,banks. An examination of the present,51
NA,position shows that the notes actually,51
NA,issued have been reduced in the last five,51
NA,years. When I spoke of the restoration,51
NA,of the note issue to the per capita require-,51
NA,"ments of the people, I had in mind the",51
NA,fact that i f the issue were of normal,51
NA,dimensions i t would be possible for insur-,51
NA,ance companies and trading banks to,51
NA,give much needed assistance .and relief,51
NA,"to many clients who, although in",51
NA,"possession of unquestioned security, are,",51
NA,"at the moment, unable to obtain finance",51
NA,to carry on their undertakings. I believe,51
NA,that large numbers of farmers and,51
NA,graziers are to-day in trouble owing to,51
NA,the difficulty of obtaining that accom-,51
NA,modation which is vital to the suc-,51
NA,"cessful harvesting of their grain, or the",51
NA,realization of their wool clips. I am,51
NA,convinced that i f these people could get,51
NA,the requisite accommodation from the,51
NA,"banks, they would be able to carry on",51
NA,successfully. Believing this course to be,51
NA,essential in order that the industries of,51
NA,"the nation may be carried on, I submit",51
NA,that the policy I have outlined should,51
NA,receive earnest consideration at the hands,51
NA,of honorable members. I conclude with,51
NA,"this observation: I f , next week or next",51
NA,month. Australia became involved in a,51
NA,"great war, those controlling our various",51
NA,banks and financial institutions would,51
NA,not talk about Australia's impaired,51
NA,"credit, which, we are given to un-",51
NA,"derstand, makes it now -so difficult",51
NA,to finance the wool clip and grain,51
NA,"crops, but, without. any apparent",51
NA,difficulty they would be able to,51
NA,finance the frightful tragedy of an inter-,51
NA,"national war with all that celerity which,",51
NA,"in the history of a nation, marks the black",51
NA,magic of money power policy.,51
Mr R GREEN ,Richmond) [9.5] -,51
NA,I listened with a great deal of interest,51
NA,to the remarks of the honorable member,51
NA,"for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), and I must",51
NA,confess that i t was only towards the end,51
NA,of his speech that I received any enligbr-,51
NA,ment about his proposals. For the most,51
NA,part the honorable member indulged in,51
NA,"generalities. Ho avoided details, because",51
NA,obviously he had no solution to offer for,51
NA,our financial difficulties other than the,51
NA,repudiation of Australia's national obli-,51
NA,gations. On that particular aspect of,51
NA,the matter the honorable member cleverly,51
NA,skated over thin and dangerous ice. He,51
NA,.talked about the claims of Australian,51
NA,"bondholders, and the only inference to be",51
NA,drawn from his remarks was that a,51
NA,solemn compact entered into by the Com-,51
NA,monwealth Government should be repudi-,51
NA,ated i f to honour it should be incon-,51
NA,venient. I was especially careful to note,51
NA,the honorable member's statement upon,51
NA,this particular point. He declared,51
NA,that the claims of the bondholders were,51
NA,not as paramount as the claims of those,51
NA,"engaged in industry. Analysed, that",51
NA,"statement means that, in the honorable",51
NA,"member's view at all events, the interests",51
NA,of bondholders are as nothing compared,51
NA,with the claim of the wage-earners.,51
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,H e would,51
NA,not admit even that the bondholders had,51
NA,equal claims. ',51
Mr R GREEN ,Th e Commonwealth,51
NA,Government voluntarily offered certain,51
NA,security in return for subscriptions to,51
NA,its various loan issues. That security,51
NA,is the honour and integrity of the Aus-,51
NA,tralian people. We cannot now deliber-,51
NA,ately violate a contract of that nature.,51
NA,The honorable the Leader of the,51
NA,Opposition ( Mr Latham) this afternoon,51
NA,quoted certain extracts from the pros-,51
NA,"pectuses of two loans issued in London,",51
NA,and one issued in Australia as evidence,51
NA,of the nature of this financial contract.,51
NA,"I f now we dishonour our obligations, the",51
NA,"Westminister Bank, which is a large",51
NA,"creditor of the Commonwealth, could not",51
NA,step in and.take charge of our railways,51
NA,or our customs administration. As a,51
NA,sovereign people we should not tolerate,51
NA,any such action. No one can deny that,51
NA,the Commonwealth Government has made,51
NA,"binding contracts with its bondholders,",51
NA,.and as honorable people we must stand,51
NA,up to them.,51
Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL ,Ther e can,51
NA,be no degrees in repudiation.,51
Mr R GREEN ,Toward s the end of,51
NA,his speech the honorable member for,51
NA,Fremantle stated that in the last seven,51
NA,years the Commonwealth debt had been,51
NA,"increased by £220,000,000. He would",51
NA,have the people believe that this was the,51
NA,result of the financial policy of the,52
NA,Page administration. I remind the,52
NA,honorable gentleman that of the sum,52
NA,"mentioned, £207,000,000 represented debts",52
NA,incurred by the Commonwealth on behalf,52
NA,"of the States, and that the increase in the",52
NA,Commonwealth public debt during the,52
NA,term mentioned was slightly under,52
NA,":t'lj!,O00,000. Many of the State Go-",52
NA,"vernments, on whose behalf the",52
NA,"Common wealth raised £207,000,000, were",52
NA,of the same political complexion as,52
NA,"ihe honorable member himself, so his",52
NA,"reference to the "" ignoble record "" of the",52
NA,preceding Nationalist governments is,52
NA,"beside the point. Already, in four months",52
NA,of the present financial year the Govern-,52
NA,"ment, of which ho is a supporter, has been",52
NA,responsible for a deficit greater than the,52
NA,accumulated deficits of the various,52
NA,Nationalist governments during the pre-,52
NA,ceding seven years.,52
NA,NA,52
NA,is budgeting for a still greater deficit.,52
Mr R GREEN , I know it is. The,52
NA,Acting Treasurer ( Mr Lyons) admitted,52
NA,the other day that i f trade conditions,52
NA,"proved, the deficit this year might be",52
NA,"anything from £S,000,000 to £10,000,000,",52
NA,"but that i f trade did not revive, i t",52
NA,"be £15,000,000. As to the deficits dis-",52
NA,closed in the administration of the various,52
NA,"States, I need only remind honorable",52
NA,members that enormous losses on the,52
NA,working of State railways are responsible,52
NA,"for their present difficulties, and, to some",52
NA,"extent, at all events, Commonwealth",52
NA,legislation is responsible. We have in,52
NA,Australia developed the unfortunate,52
NA,"practice of governing, not by Parliament,",52
NA,but by cabinet. Cabinet performs execu-,52
NA,"tive acts, the result of which is to impose",52
NA,taxation on the people. We are familiar,52
NA,with the imposition of tariff duties by,52
NA,means of schedules prepared and tabled,52
NA,by the Government. Customs duties are,52
NA,pimply a form of taxation. Since the,52
NA,present Government has been in office it,52
NA,"lias introduced many tariff schedules, not",52
NA,one item of which has yet been discussed,52
NA,by Parliament.,52
Mr LATHAM ,An d the schedules have,52
NA,"linen full of mistakes, necessitating",52
NA,quent alterations.,52
Mr R GREEN ,"On e schedule, intro-",52
NA,"duced by the Acting Prime Minister, had",52
NA,"to he altered next day, and was altered",52
NA,Bruceagain a few days later. These frequeut,52
NA,alterations threw the business community,52
NA,into such a state of confusion that it did,52
NA,not know what to do. That is .why busi-,52
NA,uess men are going bankrupt. Many of,52
NA,the troubles confronting commercial men,52
NA,at the present time may be traced to the,52
NA,ineptitude of the Cabinet. This practice,52
NA,of imposing tariff duties without con-,52
NA,sulting Parliament cuts across' a long,52
NA,accepted principle of British political,52
NA,"justice, wliich lays it down that there",52
NA,shall be no taxation without representa-,52
NA,tion. The elected representatives of the,52
NA,people in this House have had no voice,52
NA,whatsoever in the imposition of these,52
NA,"amended duties. Recently, this per-",52
NA,nicious practice was carried a step,52
NA,further. While Parliament was not sit-,52
NA,"ting, the Cabinet, by an executive act,",52
NA,actually put into the hands of a private,52
NA,"company, power to impose taxation on the",52
NA,Australian people. This was done by,52
NA,imposing an embargo upon the importa-,52
NA,"tion of galvanized iron, leaving the firm",52
NA,"of John Lysaght Limited, the sole manu-",52
NA,"facturers of such iron in Australia, a",52
NA,im- free hand to exploit the Australian con-,52
NA,sumers as it thinks fit. The guarantees,52
NA,given by the representatives of that com-,52
NA,might pany are not worth a twopenny dump. 1,52
NA,am thankful that the bill designed to give,52
NA,effect to this arrangement has yet to pass,52
NA,"another place. There, I trust, it will be",52
NA,dealt with as it deserves. I am sure that,52
NA,the people of Australia are opposed to,52
NA,the action of the Government in thus,52
NA,attempting to take the power to impose,52
NA,taxation out of the hands of Parliament.,52
NA,In my opinion much more effective,52
NA,work would be done i f we could meet here,52
NA,as a united Parliament to discuss the,52
NA,measures necessary to rehabilitate the,52
NA,"finances of the country. Unfortunately,",52
NA,"under the system of party politics, there",52
NA,are some members of this House who are,52
NA,prepared to allow the support of their,52
NA,party to get the better of their duty to the,52
NA,country. I t is also true that established,52
NA,parliamentary procedure stands in the,52
NA,way of a free discussion of the Estimates,52
NA,on a non-party basis. During a national,52
NA,"fre- emergency sueh as this, Parliament",52
NA,should be free to consider the budget on,52
NA,"its merits, and to make what alterations",52
NA,"it thinks fit. Under the present system,",52
NA,"however, the Estimates are prepared by",52
NA,"cabinet, .arid introduced to the House",53
NA,printed document which cannot be varied,53
NA,by Parliament. A. member may register,53
NA,disapproval only .by .moving that a reduc-,53
NA,tion of £1 be made in a vote .of perhaps,53
NA,"£10,000,000, and i f that motion be .agreed",53
NA,to i t is regarded as a vote of no con-,53
NA,fidence in the Government. The result,53
NA,is that Cabinet 'brings forward the,53
NA,"Estimates, and Parliament has to swallow",53
NA,them willy-nilly. I suggest that the,53
NA,revised Estimates should be brought,53
NA,before the House for discussion; that,53
NA,they should be considered by honorable,53
NA,"members on .their merits, and that desir-",53
NA,able alterations should be accepted,53
NA,by the Government.,53
NA,According to the financial statement,53
NA,"before us, it is proposed that certain",53
NA,savings shall be effected. Among the,53
NA,expenditure proposals on page 8 of the,53
NA,Acting Treasurer's statement are savings,53
NA,"on estimates amounting <to £1,230,000, of",53
NA,"which £500,000 is to be saved i n the",53
NA,Postal Department -Other economics,53
NA,"amount to £375,000 to be saved on",53
NA,"miscellaneous works, services, &c. The",53
NA,House has been given no indica-,53
NA,tion as to how 'these savings are,53
NA,to be effected. The first we learn,53
NA,of them is when the statement is laid,53
NA,"before us, and now no variation can be",53
NA,made. I t is quite likely that after the,53
NA,matter has been -discussed a majority -of,53
NA,honorable members -might be i n favour of,53
NA,further reductions. Nothing can be done,53
NA,"in that way, however. Cabinet has made",53
NA,up its mind. I f the Government will,53
NA,agree to listen to suggestions for economy,53
NA,"from Parliament, I for one undertake to",53
NA,"seek no party advantage from it, nor",53
NA,will I join in any movement that may,53
NA,be construed as a motion of censure. My,53
NA,sole object is to do my best as an elected,53
NA,representative to restore Australia to the,53
NA,"position she should .never 'have lost,",53
NA,I regret that no information has been,53
NA,forthcoming ifroain the Government,53
NA,regarding the {presence here of the dis-,53
NA,"tinguished visitor, Sir Otto Niemeyer.",53
NA,The Ministry .has not played the game,53
NA,in connexion -with this gentleman's visit.,53
NA,The Acting Prime Minister has been,53
NA,asked maaiy questions in this House ©n,53
NA,"the subject, none of <wihich he has",53
NA,answered satisfactorily. One such ques-,53
NA,"tion was asked only this morning, and",53
NA,Mr R .Green.,53
NA,as .a again we were fobbed off. Sir Otto,53
NA,Niemeyer is in Australia as the guest,53
NA,of the Commonwealth. He has made -a,53
NA,public statement as ito why he came here.,53
NA,"The Prime Minister, ihefore leaving Aus-",53
NA,"tralia, made various announcements as",53
NA,to the reason for Sir Otto Niemeyer's,53
NA,"presence. Mr Hogan, ,the Premier of",53
NA,"Victoria, also had something to say on the",53
NA,matter. The honorable member for,53
NA,"Dalley (. Mr Theodore), when he was",53
NA,"Treasurer, made certain statements as",53
NA,to why Sir Otto Niemeyer was in Aus-,53
NA,tralia. [Quorum formed.'] Dealing,53
NA,"with -the same .subject, the Acting Treas-",53
NA,urer ( Mr Lyons) said-,53
NA,Mr Theodore found difficulty in his way at-,53
NA,"Treasurer, and he conferred with the British",53
NA,"(Labour) Government, which consulted with",53
NA,the Bank of England. The bank suggested,53
NA,to Mr Snowden that i t would be -.prepared,53
NA,"to send Sir Otto Niemeyer to Australia, a",53
NA,request which was acquiesced in by .the,53
NA,(Federal) Cabinet. Sir Otto Niemeyer camr,53
NA,at his .own expense.,53
Mr LYONS , I have to admit that my,53
NA,statement in that regard was not strictly,53
NA,"accurate, although I thought it was true",53
NA,at the time.,53
NA,"Mr R GREEN,-""Wh y has not the",53
NA,House heen told the truth regarding the,53
NA,matter? The only speeches which the,53
NA,Acting Prime Minister has made in this,53
NA,"House were read by him, hut i n none of",53
NA,"them was there any mention pf ,the reason",53
NA,for Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit tp Aus-,53
NA,tralia. He leav.es the inference to he,53
NA,drawn that there is connected with the,53
NA,visit .something of which he is ashamed.,53
Mr LATHAM , N o t at .all. I t is only,53
NA,that those on that side of the House are,53
NA,frightened .of Mr Lang. They have no,53
NA,minds of their own.,53
Mr R GREEN ,Si r Otto Niemeyer,53
NA,published details ^concerning his visit to,53
NA,"Australia, and they have not been",53
NA,officially contradicted by any person,53
NA,of importance. I n view of the,53
NA,great importance attached to Sir,53
NA,Otto's ivisit -during the recent New South,53
NA,"Wales State elections, the .people of Aus-",53
NA,tralia are entitled to know the facts. The,53
NA,attitude of the Acting Prime Minister,53
NA,( Mr Fenton) in tbe matter may deceive,53
NA,"his followers, but it does not mislead",53
NA,honorable members on this side. The,53
NA,reason >why he has made mo reply to Sir,53
NA,"Qtto',s statement is that -he has no ade-",53
NA,quate reply to igiye..,53
NA,"Mil-: LATHAM.:-It , has been admitted",54
NA,by the Acting Prime Minister that Sir,54
NA,Otto Niemeyer came out under agreeexplain,54

NA,ment.,54
NA,Mr Bi GEEEN -Si r Otto Niemeyer's,54
NA,advice wassought by the LoanCouncil.,54
NA,I am positive that he attended meetings,54
NA,of that body at its invitation. He tenance,54
NA,"dered certain advice, but I am unable",54
NA,learn whether it was accepted or not.,54
NA,"That, gentleman came to Australia at the",54
NA,request of the Commonwealth Governrepresenting;,54
NA,"ment, and i t was extremely regrettable",54
NA,that he should be treated in such a churdebts,54
NA,lish manner. Tt is certainly not the,54
NA,kind'of hospitality upon which we in Aussome,54
NA,"tralia pride ourselves. However, the",54
NA,repudiation of Sir Otto Niemeyer by,54
NA,Commonwealth Government is on all,54
NA,tioiirs with its repudiation of its,54
NA,"obligations, some of which were referred",54
NA,to by the honorable member for,54

NA,member opposite with sumcient courage,54

NA,The Government deny having retc,54

NA,Minister will tell me off-hand how much,54
NA,ouo; life insurance companies contributed,54
NA,our. war debts. I think he said that,54
NA,"the amount was- £65,000,000. Cancella--",54

NA,I shall instance yet another form of,54
NA,of our repudiation on thepart of honorable,54
NA,them membeiss. opposite The honorable mem-,54
NA,ber! foe Calare ( Mr Gibbons)' promised,54
NA,farmers that i f he andhis. colleagues,54
NA,"were elected, primary producers would be",55
NA,paid 6s. or 6s. 6d. a bushel for their,55
NA,"wheat, within twelve months. What has",55
NA,"he done about it? Why, repudiated his",55
NA,promise! When the Wheat Marketing,55
NA,"Bill, which proposed a guarantee to",55
NA,primary producers of 4s. a bushel for,55
NA,"their wheat, was brought down, the hon-",55
NA,orable member did not even try to,55
NA,split the difference and have the,55
NA,guarantee fixed at f>s. a bushel. He,55
NA,"remained dumb, and repudiated his",55
NA,"promise, and that has been the at-",55
NA,titude of the Labour party through-,55
NA,out the piece. It has made promise after,55
NA,"promise, knowing definitely that it could",55
NA,"not fulfil them. When the time came it,",55
NA,repudiated its promises. On the 7th May,55
NA,last the Prime Minister promised that,55
NA,"returned soldiers would have, not only",55
NA,"preference of employment, but preference",55
NA,when it came to dismissals. On the 5th,55
NA,November the honorable member for,55
NA,Balaclava ( Mr White) asked the Post-,55
NA,master-General how many employees had,55
NA,been dismissed from the Postmaster-,55
NA,General's Department. It was then dis-,55
NA,"closed that the number was 2,292. Of",55
NA,"that number 1,429 were returned soldiers,",55
NA,"1,144 of whom had been in the depart-",55
NA,ment for two years aud over.,55
NA,definite promise made by the Prime,55
NA,Minister was repudiated. A similar,55
NA,state of affairs applies to the Department,55
NA,of Public Works. Since the 30th June,55
NA,"last, 775 employees have been dismissed",55
NA,"from that department, 332 of whom were",55
NA,"returned men, temporary employees.",55
NA,That is the way in which the Government,55
NA,keeps its promises. [Quorum formed.],55
NA,I have to direct attention to still,55
NA,other act of repudiation. I refer to the,55
NA,repudiation of the decisions of the Pre-,55
NA,miers' Conference held i n Melbourne last,55
NA,"August, and to which the Prime Min-",55
NA,ister was a party. The resolution carried,55
NA,at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour,55
NA,Party a few days ago showed that a,55
NA,majority of the party is in favour of,55
NA,repudiating the definite promises made,55
NA,by the Prime Minister. Where is this,55
NA,repudiation to end ?,55
Mr LEWIS ,I t has not started.,55
Mr R GREEN ,I t will be rememnotice,55
NA,bered that some time ago the CommonGovernment,55
NA,wealth Government agreed uot to enter,55
NA,any further upon the field of income,55
NA,"taxation, but to leave it to the States.",55
NA,Yet a few days ago an income tax assess-,55
NA,ment bill was introduced which in effect,55
NA,repudiated that undertaking. I t ap-,55
NA,peal's that the honorable member for,55
NA,Corio ( Mr Lewis) spoke truly a moment,55
NA,ago when he said that repudiation had,55
NA,not yet started.,55
Mr LEWIS ,Tha t is not what I said:,55
NA,it is a lie.,55
Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER ,,55
NA,( Mr Chifley) -Order ! The honorable,55
NA,member for Corio must withdraw that,55
NA,remark.,55
Mr LEWIS ,"O n a point of order, I",55
NA,wish to ask whether the honorable mem-,55
NA,ber for Richmond is in order in making,55
NA,untrue statements?,55
Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER ,,55
NA,-Th e honorable member must withdraw,55
NA,his statement.,55
Mr LEWIS , I withdraw.,55
Mr R GREEN , I do not propose to,55
NA,discuss the proposal of the Government,55
NA,to increase the taxation of income from,55
NA,property except to say that it is a direct,55
NA,blow at the thrifty classes in the com-,55
NA,The munity who try to make provision for,55
NA,their old age. There are many people in,55
NA,our midst who have saved money by,55
NA,"taking out life insurance policies, or who",55
NA,"have received small legacies, the proceeds",55
NA,of which they have invested in property,55
NA,in the belief that the return would keep,55
NA,them in their old age. But this Govern-,55
NA,ment proposes that such people who have,55
NA,an income of £200 a year from these,55
NA,sources shall be taxed to the extent of,55
NA,anover £20 - a year. I n other words these,55
NA,"people, who are receiving less than",55
NA,"the basic wage, will be viciously taxed. 1",55
NA,understand that a person with an in-,55
NA,come of £300 a year from property will,55
NA,have to pay more than £50 a year taxa-,55
NA,"tion. Such persons will, therefore, pay",55
NA,more income taxation than persons in,55
NA,"receipt of £1,000 a year from personal",55
NA,"exertion, although their income may be",55
NA,the fruits of the savings of a lifetime.,55
NA,The iniquitous nature of this proposed,55
NA,taxation should be brought under the,55
NA,of the general community. The,55
NA,is seeking to tax the most,55
NA,"deserving class in the community, namely,",55
NA,the thrifty middle class-peopl e who are,55
NA,neither/ actually poor nor actually well-,56
NA,"to-do, but who possess only a bare com-",56
NA,petence with which to maintain them-,56
NA,selves. Income from superannuation,56
NA,funds is not regarded as income from per-,56
NA,"sonal exertion, so that persons who live",56
NA,on income from superannuation will also,56
NA,be very heavily taxed. I t appears to me,56
NA,that the Government is so much against,56
NA,reducing its general expenditure that i t is,56
NA,prepared to tax any one and every one,56
NA,without regard for justice.,56
NA,Reference was made this afternoon to,56
NA,"the proposed tax on certain, civil servants.",56
NA,"I t is deplorable that only 1 per cent, of",56
NA,the Civil Service should be called upon to,56
NA,pay tins special taxation. Only 441,56
NA,"officers out of more than 44,000 will be",56
NA,taxed.,56
NA,I could go on with this sordid story for,56
NA,"a long while, but I have said enough to",56
NA,show how inept the present Government,56
NA,is to deal with the existing financial posi-,56
NA,"tion. I suggest once again that, seeing",56
NA,"that, the Govermnent. is not prepared",56
NA,to resign and let' a new Government,56
NA,"attempt to straighten out. the position, it",56
NA,phould make it possible for the collective,56
NA,brains of this Parliament to be used to,56
NA,formulate ways and means ofcorrecting,56

Mr LYONS ,Wilmot-Actin g Trea-,56
NA,surer) [9.55] - I wish to inform honor-,56
NA,able members that the Commonwealth,56
NA,Government is issuing immediately a,56
NA,conversion and redemption loan. The,56
NA,main purpose of this loan is to provide,56
NA,for the conversion of the 6 per cent. Com-,56
NA,monwealth loan which falls due on 15th,56
NA,"December. At the same time, cash sub-",56
NA,scriptions are being invited to pay off,56
NA,those holders in the maturing loan who,56
NA,"are unable to convert, and also to provide",56
NA,for shortages that have occurred in the,56
NA,conversion of certain State securities.,56
NA,The loan has been sanctioned by the,56
NA,"Australian Loan Council, and the terms",56
NA,which have been approved are in accord-,56
NA,ance with recommendations that have,56
NA,been made by the Commonwealth Bank.,56
NA,Investors are being given the option of,56
NA,"three currencies, namely:- A two years'",56
NA,"currency carrying interest at 6 per cent,",56
NA,"per annum, a ten years currency at 5f per",56
NA,"cent., and a twenty years' currency at 5 i",56
NA,per cent. These terms will apply both to,56
NA,"conversions and cash subscriptions, and",56
NA,have been designed to meet the con-,56
NA,venience of all investors.,56
NA,"As I have already stated, the major",56
NA,portion of this operation deals with the,56
NA,Commonwealth loan repayable on 15th,56
NA,December. Originally the December loan,56
NA,"totalled £60,000,000, but the conversion,",56
NA,operation of March last and redemptions,56
NA,from sinking fund and other moneys have,56
NA,reduced the outstanding indebtedness to,56
NA,"approximately £20,000,000. As £2,000,000",56
NA,of sinking fund moneys will be available,56
NA,to pay off holders who are not in a posi-,56
NA,"tion to convert, the amount to be covered",56
NA,"on the 15th December is £18,000,000. I n",56
NA,"addition, i t is necessary to provide for a",56
NA,"shortage of £600,000 on a Northern Terri-",56
NA,"tory loan which recently matured, aud",56
NA,"for £9,400,000 of State securities matur-",56
NA,ing in the near future.,56
NA,"I n present circumstances, when there is",56
NA,much unemployment and business condi-,56
NA,"tions are difficult, higher rates of interest",56
NA,than those offered would not be fair to,56
NA,the taxpayer or helpful to the revival of,56
NA,trade and employment. I n fixing the,56
NA,"terms, the Loan Council has tried to hold",56
NA,the scales evenly.,56
NA,I need hardly emphasize the great im-,56
NA,"portance of this loan operation, and how",56
NA,"essential it is, in the national interests,",57
NA,"that the loan, shall be successful. The",57
NA,financial! situation at present is exceed-,57
NA,ingly difficult. Not even in the war time,57
NA,were the financial problems of Australia,57
NA,more formidable than they areto-day.,57
NA,"Tlie Government, therefore) earnestly",57
NA,seeks the co-operation of all who have the,57
NA,welfare of the Commonwealth at heart'.,57

NA,Experience has shownthat much more,57
NA,than the four or five weeks that still,57

NA,"sary to, make a loan, of this magnitude",57

NA,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,12
Mr HAWKE ,Wills-Prime Minister)-I,12
NA,inform the House that the Minister for Trade,12
NA,"and Overseas Development, Dr Blewett, is",12
NA,overseas holding discussions on GATT and,12
NA,will return to Australia tomorrow. In his,12
NA,absence from Question Time today questions,12
NA,which normally would be addressed to Dr,12
NA,Blewett should be addressed to the Attorney-,12
NA,"General, Mr Duffy.",12
NA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,12
NA,Interest Rates,12
Dr HEWSON,My question is directed to,12
NA,the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that on one,12
NA,side of the interest rate debate we have the,12
NA,"Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the",12
NA,Treasury and lined up opposing them are the,12
NA,honourable member for Blaxland and the,12
NA,Governor of the Reserve Bank? Does this,12
NA,open conflict signal to the Australian people,12
NA,that the Hawke Government does not have a,12
NA,clue about the direction of interest rates,12
NA,midst of the worst recession in 60 years a,12
NA,-ecession engineered by extremely high,12
NA,mterest rates?,12
Mr HAWKE,The honourable gentleman,12
NA,raises the issue of sources of advice on what,12
NA,should happen to interest rates. Let me make,12
NA,one point to him which should be without,12
NA,debate at all: I would not look to him-nor,12
NA,would any sensible person-on the question,12
NA,of what should happen to interest rates. I,12
NA,remind the House of the statement made by,12
NA,the Leader of the Opposition when we com-,12
NA,menced the reduction of interest rates in,12
NA,January of last year. His classic comment at,12
NA,"that time was, 'The Treasurer, his",12
NA,"Government and, indeed, the Reserve Bank",12
NA,should hang their heads in shame'. That was,12
NA,"in January 1990, when we commenced the 8t h",12
NA,percentage point reduction in interest rates,12
NA,which is now being effected. The position of,12
NA,the Leader of the Opposition was that this,12
NA,was an incorrect decision and that the,12
NA,Government should have kept interest rates,12
NA,higher for longer than it did. That is the,12
NA,"position of the Leader of the Opposition, so",12
NA,he speaks from no position of strength on this,12
NA,question of interest rates.,12
NA,"As far as the processes are concerned, I will",12
NA,not comment on any speculation in the news-,12
NA,"papers, but I will m-ke some points about the",12
NA,Government's co-uct o- monetary policy.,12
NA,We observe due process m this matter and,12
NA,"unlike the Leader of the Opposition, w-",12
NA,"respect the position of the Reserve Bank, its",12
NA,Governor and its board. We do not undertake,12
NA,a process qf public denigration of people,12
NA,occupying positions of important responsibili-,12
NA,ty.,12
NA,I remind the House that the last interest rate,12
NA,reduction was based on the unanimous advice,12
NA,"of the board, formulated at its regularly",12
NA,scheduled meeting. That is what happened on,12
NA,the last occasion. This Government and its,12
NA,"advisers, including the Reserve Bank will",12
NA,continue to monitor developments ht the,12
NA,economy and to ensure that the setting of,12
NA,monetary policy remains closely attuned to,12
NA,achieving the economic objectives of this,12
NA,Government. The stance that we have estab-,12
NA,lished is designed to facilitate the recovery,12
NA,in the which is now becoming evident without re-,12
NA,igniting inflationary development. I am sure,12
NA,that everyone in this House would agree with,12
NA,that.,12
NA,Let me make it clear that this Government,12
NA,"does not intend to forgo growth, including job",12
NA,"growth, to achieve zero inflation-which is so",12
NA,glibly talked about by the honourable gentle-,12
NA,man who has asked this question-by having,12
NA,"!hat unrealistic inflation objective, nor does it",12
NA,mtend to have an excessive easing of policy,12
NA,to launch Australia on the path of boom that,12
NA,inevitably would be followed by bust.,12
NA,"Since January 1990, the way in which the",12
NA,"Government has conducted monetary policy,",12
NA,against the position of the Leader of the,13
NA,"Opposition, has been to the benefit of this",13
NA,country. There has been an 81/2 percentage,13
NA,point reduction in interest rates-a process,13
NA,"which, as I say, was opposed by the Leader",13
NA,of the Opposition. At all times we have,13
NA,followed due process; we will continue to do,13
NA,"so and, in following due process, we will not",13
NA,engage in that tactic of the Leader of the,13
NA,"Opposition of, without any basis at all, attack-",13
NA,ing the integrity of people who have a statu-,13
NA,tory duty to uphold the position of this,13
NA,country in regard to the responsible conduct,13
NA,of policy.,13
NA,Australian Council of Social Service:,13
NA,Assistance to Needy,13
Mr LES SCOTT,My question is ad-,13
NA,dressed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform,13
NA,the House what action has been taken to assist,13
NA,those affected by the economic downturn?,13
NA,Does he intend to take any additional meas-,13
NA,ures to assist Australians affected by the,13
NA,downturn?,13
Mr HAWKE,This is a very timely ques-,13
NA,"tion, and I thank the honourable member for",13
NA,Oxley for it. I spoke to ACOSS last week and,13
NA,"outlined that the Government, Mr Acting",13
NA,"Speaker, as you know, has a comprehensive",13
NA,safety net for those people directly affected-,13
Dr HEWSON ,Answer the question.,13
Mr HAWKE,I know the Leader of the,13
NA,"Opposition wants to interrupt; after last week,",13
NA,he will not want to hear anyone talking about,13
NA,ACOSS. He should be ashamed of his per-,13
NA,"formance, as I will show. We will come to",13
NA,the Leader of the Opposition and ACOSS in,13
NA,"a moment. Let me say, as I pointed out to",13
NA,"ACOSS, that we have this comprehensive",13
NA,"safety net in place. First, we have substantial-",13
NA,ly increased in real terms benefits for those in,13
NA,"need. For an unemployed single adult, we",13
NA,have increased real benefits by 26 per cent;,13
NA,for those not renting privately and for those,13
NA,"renting privately, we have increased benefits",13
NA,"by 54 per cent. Secondly, we have, with the",13
NA,"introduction of Newstart, assisted the unem-",13
NA,ployed to find jobs through a-tive job search,13
NA,"and training. Finally, of course, the last line",13
NA,of defence in the safety net is emergency,13
NA,"relief. You will know, Mr Acting Speaker,",13
NA,that in the Budget that emergency relief,13
NA,funding was increased by $3m to a total of,13
NA,"$1O.84m and that last week, when I was",13
NA,"speaking to ACOSS, I announced an increase",13
NA,in additional funding of $3.5m this year to,13
NA,bring the total funds available in 1991-92 to,13
NA,$14.4m.,13
NA,Against that background of the demonstrat-,13
NA,ed real concern of the Government for look-,13
NA,ing after those who have been adversely,13
NA,"affected by the economic downturn, I imagine",13
NA,"that most members in this place, not only",13
NA,those on this side of the House but many on,13
NA,"the other side, would have been bemused by",13
NA,the amazing speech of the Leader of the,13
NA,Opposition to ACOSS last week. For exam-,13
NA,"ple, the Leader of the Opposition said to",13
NA,ACOSS:,13
NA,I put it to you that the Coalition is just as interested,13
NA,in welfare and just as interested in assisting the,13
NA,genuinely needy as the Labor Party . . .,13
NA,Yet in the same speech he confirmed the,13
NA,policy of the Opposition to throw onto the,13
NA,street after nine months those who are unem-,13
NA,ployed. That is the measure of this man who,13
NA,wants the Australian public to believe he is,13
NA,compassionate. The revelation of the working,13
NA,of the mind of the Leader of the Opposition,13
NA,was in fact contained in an article in the,13
NA,Sydney Morning Herald on 3 August this,13
NA,year. I would ask members of the House to,13
NA,just pick up closely how the mind of the,13
NA,Leader of the Opposition works. This is what,13
NA,he had to say:,13
NA,The basics of my beliefs are in economics. They,13
NA,stem originally from a lot of theoretical work that,13
NA,"I did myself, building multi-country computer",13
NA,"models of regulated financial systems, for example,",13
NA,then breaking down the regulations in the models.,13
NA,And then cranking out all the properties to see what,13
NA,"effect it has on interest rates, growth and employ-",13
NA,"ment, and things like that.",13
NA,Mr Simmons-What about people?,13
Mr HAWKE,The honourable member,13
NA,"correctly interjects, 'What about people?'.",13
NA,Where are people in this desiccated calculat-,13
NA,ing machine? There is no concern for,13
NA,people-,13
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,13
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Order!,13
Mr HAWKE,The Opposition Leader,14
NA,gave us another revealing insight in this,14
NA,speech. I ask the House to take note of what,14
NA,"he said when speaking to ACOSS, this collecon",14
NA,tion of honourable people of integrity who,14
NA,make up ACOSS. I will table a list of the,14
NA,members who make up ACOSS. Without an,14
NA,"being exhaustive about it, these are the",14
NA,who were so viciously attacked by the,14
NA,of the Opposition: the Anglican Church of,14
NA,Australia; the Social Responsibilities,14
NA,"Commission, the Australian Conference of",14
NA,"Leaders of Religious Institutes, the Federation",14
NA,of Australian Jewish Welfare Societies;,14
NA,Legacy Coordinating Council; the National,14
NA,Anglican Caring Organisations Network; the,14
NA,National Association of Community Based,14
NA,Children's Services; the National Catholic,14
NA,Association of Family Agencies; the Salvation,14
NA,"Army, Southern Command and Eastern for",14
NA,Command; and the Society of St Vincent de,14
NA,Paul. These are the organisations to,14
NA,Leader of the Opposition had this to say:,14
NA,By concentrating on expanding and approving,14
NA,"provision of welfare, in one sense at least,",14
NA,is just reinforcing the Biblical reminder that,14
NA,poor are always with us.,14
NA,What did the Leader of the Opposition mean,14
NA,"by that statement, reminding us that the poor",14
NA,are always with us? Does he mean that by,14
NA,"taking away welfare from people, the people",14
NA,whom he calls the poor will,14
NA,the scene? Or does he mean that because the,14
NA,poor are always with us that it is not worth,14
NA,doing anything to help them? The Leader of,14
NA,the Opposition owes it to the House and to,14
NA,the hundreds of thousands of decent people of,14
NA,integrity involved in working with those 55,14
NA,organisations of ACOSS to explain what he,14
NA,means about the proposition that the poor,14
NA,always with us.,14
NA,This gentleman in his speech to ACOSS has,14
NA,demeaned the concept of parliamentary,14
NA,responsibility to those in need in this,14
NA,community. He has made a mockery of any,14
NA,concept of compassion. Those opposite will,14
NA,stand condemned and will reap their reward,14
NA,in 1993.,14
NA,The Honourable Member for Blaxland,14
Mr MCARTHUR,Is the Prime Minister improving.,14
NA,aware of comments by the Victorian State,14
NA,"Secretary of the AMIEU, Mr Wally Curran,",14
NA,that the honourable member for Blaxland,14
NA,should be elevated to the prime ministership,14
NA,the basis of his support for job creation?,14
NA,Is it the Prime Minister's view that their,14
NA,combined experience-the former in creating,14
NA,"unemployment pool of one million, and the",14
NA,people latter in reducing the work force of the,14
NA,"Leader Victorian meat industry from 7,000 to",14
NA,"1,800-ideally equips them to guide Australia",14
NA,out of the recession we had to have?,14
Mr HAWKE,That is a very uncharitable,14
NA,"question indeed. It is uncharitable to me, it is",14
NA,uncharitable to the honourable member for,14
NA,"Blaxland, and it is uncharitable to Mr Curran.",14
NA,Mr Downer interjecting-,14
Mr HAWKE,May I say in response to,14
NA,the interjection from the honourable member,14
NA,"Mayo that I dream about him, that I have",14
NA,very little time for dreaming and what I do,14
NA,whom the have I do not waste on Curran.,14
NA,"As I have indicated, I am quite relaxed",14
NA,the about the way this great Labor movement,14
NA,ACOSS operates. We have been going for 100 years,14
NA,the now. In that time we have found that sections,14
NA,of the political movement talk to sections of,14
NA,the industrial movement. It is good for busi-,14
NA,"ness. As far as we are concerned, we will do",14
NA,"what we have to do; that is, having slowed",14
NA,"down the Australian economy, as we had to",14
NA,disappear from do in the period-,14
NA,Mr Broadbent-Slowed it down!,14
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Order! The,14
NA,honourable member for Corinella!,14
Mr HAWKE,I have explained the,14
NA,statistics before. When the honourable mem-,14
NA,ber for Blaxland was the Treasurer we had to,14
NA,are slow the Australian economy down. We did,14
NA,"that. We did it, as I have indicated in my",14
NA,"previous answer, with a concern for those",14
NA,who would be adversely affected. Now we are,14
NA,able to point to the fact that we are now,14
NA,emerging from that recession and we are,14
NA,doing it from an infinitely stronger base than,14
NA,we had before.,14
NA,We have a rate of inflation which is signifi-,14
NA,cantly lower than that of our major trading,14
NA,partners. Our external position is steadily,14
NA,As we go into the second half of,14
NA,"this financial year, employment will begin to",14
NA,recover significantly. As a nation comes out,15
NA,"of recession, employment is always the last",15
NA,indicator to recover because employers keep,15
NA,on an excess of labour in times of recession.,15
NA,My colleagues in Government and I are,15
NA,going about that business. If people-whether,15
NA,"on the side of government, in the trade union",15
NA,movement or in ACOSS-have specific,15
NA,"proposals that they want us to consider, we",15
NA,will do so.,15
NA,Trends in Disposable Income,15
Mr LANGMORE,Is the Minister repre-,15
NA,senting the Minister for Social Security aware,15
NA,of a survey of trends in disposable income in,15
NA,"Australia during the last eight years? If so,",15
NA,would he tell the House the conclusions of,15
NA,that survey and its implications?,15
Mr HOWE,I thank the honourable,15
NA,member for Fraser.,15
Mr HOWARD ,Are we going to have a bit,15
NA,of retribution?,15
Mr HOWE,I do not mind being labelled,15
NA,compassionate. The honourable member for,15
NA,Bennelong may not like to be regarded as,15
NA,"such, but if that is a label he wants to put on",15
NA,"me, I accept it. The study by Dr Harding and",15
NA,John Lant carefully demonstrates the signifi-,15
NA,cant progress that this Government has made,15
NA,in alleviating poverty among the most vul-,15
NA,"nerable groups in our society-the aged, the",15
NA,"disabled, sole parents, the unemployed and",15
NA,low income and single income families with,15
NA,young children.,15
NA,The study shows that the real disposable,15
NA,incomes for social security recipients in-,15
NA,creased sharply after taking full account of,15
NA,"inflation. For example, the real disposable",15
NA,income for a full rate pensioner couple rose,15
NA,by almost 15 per cent. Increases were higher,15
NA,for those renting privately or with children,15
NA,under 16. The real disposable income for a,15
NA,sole parent with two children renting privately,15
NA,rose by almost 26 per cent.,15
NA,"The Leader of the Opposition, in his speech",15
NA,"to the ACOSS congress, was outraged that",15
NA,those who were unemployed experienced a,15
NA,real increase in their disposable income of 26,15
NA,per cent over the last eight years-a stagger-,15
NA,ing 54 per cent if they received rent assist-,15
NA,ance. These increases were understood by,15
NA,social security recipients. When we hear,15
NA,interjections from the Opposition about work,15
NA,"being the solution, it is hardly the solution for",15
NA,the aged when they are in poverty or disad-,15
NA,vantaged. The aged certainly remember that,15
NA,in 1983 the pension was only 22 per cent of,15
NA,average weekly earnings. They understand,15
NA,that it is now 26 per cent of average weekly,15
NA,earnings. The suggestion that somehow the,15
NA,Hawke Government favours welfare over,15
NA,work is erroneous.,15
NA,The Leader of the Opposition asserts that,15
NA,there are a large number of people receiving,15
NA,the dole who feel no pressure to go out and,15
NA,get themselves jobs. That is an extraordinary,15
NA,statement coming from the Leader of the,15
NA,Opposition. The reality is that no government,15
NA,has done more than this Government to link,15
NA,the social security system to an active em-,15
NA,ployment strategy. Unlike the Opposition,15
NA,"when it was in government in 1982-83, when",15
NA,little was done to create any relationship,15
NA,between the unemployment benefit and work,15
NA,"and training, this Government has placed a",15
NA,great deal of emphasis on seeking to maxi-,15
NA,mise the opportunities for people to leave,15
NA,dependants on benefits and take up the oppor-,15
NA,tunities to find work.,15
NA,"Indeed, there is no clearer contrast between",15
NA,the Government and the Opposition than that,15
NA,between a policy that would simply cut,15
NA,"people off after nine months, simply saying,",15
NA,'After nine months you don't get paid any,15
NA,"more, you don't deserve any more assess-",15
NA,ments; after nine months you go on the scrap,15
NA,"heap', and a policy that, when people reach",15
NA,"long term unemployment, seeks to structure",15
NA,assistance more in line with training and other,15
NA,forms of assistance for unemployment.,15
NA,Programs such as JET and Newstart and,15
NA,disability reforms are all about offering people,15
NA,opportunities to get into the mainstream of,15
NA,our community life. Rather than the,15
NA,Government looking at the issue of unem-,15
NA,"ployment as a welfare issue, it has seen that",15
NA,"issue as one that needs to be addressed,",15
NA,certainly in terms of improved benefits while,15
NA,"people are outside the work force, and it has",15
NA,also seen it as one that maximises the oppor-,15
NA,tunities that can be taken to ensure that,15
NA,people return to meaningful work.,15
NA,When one returns to the ACOSS speech by,16
NA,"the Leader of the Opposition, in a sense one",16
NA,is looking through a window back into the,16
NA,"nineteenth century, looking at the attitudes",16
NA,that were there1in the depression of the 1890s.,16
NA,"Mr Thckey- Mr Acting Speaker, I have a",16
NA,point of order. Standing order 145 deals with,16
NA,the matter of relevance. It would be a great,16
NA,"opportunity for you personally, Mr Acting",16
NA,"Speaker, to demonstrate to this Parliament",16
NA,"that you at least understand its meaning,",16
NA,which clearly the Ministers do not. I would,16
NA,suggest that the Minister has no responsibility,16
NA,for speeches made by other people and that it,16
NA,would be a good idea if he told us how he,16
NA,was going to fix the unemployment problem,16
NA,and not talk about handouts.,16
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,There is no,16
NA,point of order. The answer is still relevant to,16
NA,"the question. However, I am sure the Minister",16
NA,will assist the House by drawing his answer,16
NA,to a conclusion.,16
Mr HOWE,I am happy to do that. I am,16
NA,simply drawing the parallel that when one,16
NA,"looks at the language of the speech, what one",16
NA,"returns to is the nineteenth century, when at",16
NA,least towards the end of that period progress-,16
NA,ive social workers recognised that there was,16
NA,something somehow wrong about a distinction,16
NA,"between the deserving and undeserving poor,",16
NA,that we could do a little better in terms of,16
NA,conceptualisation than talk about people who,16
NA,"are genuinely poor, as if those who are",16
NA,"unemployed, those who happen to be in a",16
NA,situation of dependency because of marriage,16
NA,"breakdowns, those who suffer from a disabili-",16
NA,"ty, are somehow responsible for their own",16
NA,situation.,16
NA,Mr Thckey-I have a point of order. I,16
NA,"applauded your decision, Mr Acting Speaker.",16
NA,"The Minister is now ignoring you, insulting",16
NA,"you, and should bring his answer to a conclu-",16
NA,sion as you suggested.,16
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,I am listening,16
NA,to the Minister's summing::-up of his answer.,16
Mr HOWE,That is the tenor of the,16
NA,speech by the Leader of the Opposition. It is,16
NA,a tenor which is not simply out of touch with,16
NA,"contemporary welfare, but it has been out of",16
NA,touch with good thinking in terms of social,16
NA,policy for a century. That is what is wrong,16
NA,with it. It is an intellectual contribution that,16
NA,",represents all of the conservative values for a",16
NA,class which may have dominated the nine-,16
NA,teenth century but ought to take its place in,16
NA,the twentieth century and work with people,16
NA,rather than against them in the insulting way,16
NA,suggested by the Leader of the Opposition at,16
NA,ACOSS.,16
NA,Prime Minister,16
Mr REITH,My question is directed to the,16
NA,Prime Minister. I refer him to an interview,16
NA,"with his former Deputy, the honourable",16
NA,"member for Blaxland, Mr Keating, that was",16
NA,published in the Sydney Morning Herald last,16
NA,weekend. In this interview the honourable,16
NA,member for Blaxland is quoted as saying:,16
NA,I won't serve a person who can't keep their word.,16
NA,If the Prime Minister's close colleague of,16
NA,"eight years does not trust him, why should the",16
NA,Australian people?,16
Mr HAWKE,All I can say is that some-,16
NA,time in 1993 the Australian people will be,16
NA,given the opportunity to decide whether they,16
NA,trust me or the honourable member for,16
NA,"Flinders, if he is still here. There is not a",16
NA,great deal of certainty in Australian politics.,16
NA,I will be leading the Government in the,16
NA,election in 1993. I am not sure whether Dr,16
NA,Hewson will be leading the Opposition. It is,16
NA,our even less sure whether the honourable mem-,16
NA,ber for Flinders will be the Deputy Leader of,16
NA,"the Liberal Party. But whoever is there, the",16
NA,"Australian people will have the chance, as",16
NA,"they did in 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990, to",16
NA,choose between a government-,16
NA,Mr Reith-Why don't you create jobs?,16
Mr HAWKE,To that quiet little sotto,16
NA,voce interjection 'Why don't you create,16
NA,"jobs?', I will tell the honourable gentleman",16
NA,what we have done. Including the loss of,16
NA,"employment in the last 12 months, this",16
NA,Government has created on average each year,16
NA,"177,000 new jobs. That is three times faster",16
NA,than in the period of the Leader of the,16
NA,"Opposition's predecessors, when he was",16
NA,advising them how to run the economy. He,16
NA,made an absolute mess of it then; he is now,16
NA,showing that he is incompetent. He will,16
NA,increase inflation with his goods and services,16
NA,"tax-theoretically, because he will not be",17
NA,bringing it in.,17
Dr HEWSON ,"Oh, come on!",17
Mr HAWKE,Of course he will not. He,17
NA,"will not be elected, so he will not be there to",17
NA,"bring it in. But, conceptually, if he were to",17
NA,have the chance to bring in his goods and,17
NA,"services tax, he would smash the gains on",17
NA,"inflation that we have made, he would lose",17
NA,"our competitiveness, and he would increase",17
NA,"unemployment, particularly when the Opposi-",17
NA,tion talks about slashing expenditures by $4,17
NA,billion. As I have said in answer to the,17
NA,"Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the chance",17
NA,will be given to the people sometime in 1993,17
NA,to make their choice on whom they want to,17
NA,rely upon. As they have done on the four,17
NA,"previous occasions, they will pick the",17
NA,Australian Labor Party under my leadership,17
NA,because we leave the Opposition for dead in,17
NA,terms of economic management and social,17
NA,compassion.,17
NA,Occupational Superannuation,17
Mr SAWFORD,Has the Treasurer seen,17
NA,reports proposing that occupational superan-,17
NA,"nuation be scrapped to save 100,000 jobs?",17
NA,What would the effects be of such a measure?,17
NA,Is it the intention of the Government to scrap,17
NA,occupational superannuation?,17
Mr KERIN,No doubt the honourable,17
NA,member's question is provoked by the sugges-,17
NA,tion that came from the remarkable speech of,17
NA,the Leader of the Opposition to the ACOSS,17
NA,national conference where he saw fit to attack,17
NA,organisations such as the Salvation Army and,17
NA,the St Vincent de Paul Society. But I find it,17
NA,incredible that even this Opposition Leader,17
NA,would get up in front of the nation's peak,17
NA,welfare organisations and tell them that the,17
NA,Government should scrap a policy which will,17
NA,allow all working Australians to provide for,17
NA,their old age. Already something like 70 per,17
NA,cent of wage and salary earners are covered,17
NA,by occupational superannuation. The Leader,17
NA,of the Opposition made that statement know-,17
NA,ing that our population is ageing and that it,17
NA,will become an increasing burden over,17
NA,coming decades for those in the work force to,17
NA,provide the existing level of age pension for,17
NA,retirees. It is obvious what the implication of,17
NA,that will be for the living standards of future,17
NA,generations of Australian workers. In the,17
NA,"absence of occupational superannuation, they",17
NA,would have to be taxed more heavily to,17
NA,provide age pensions.,17
NA,ill years gone by most people would have,17
NA,assumed that a Leader of the Liberal Party,17
NA,would be enthusiastic about a measure which,17
NA,would help people provide for their old age,17
NA,"rather than rely on the social security system,",17
NA,particularly a measure which would give them,17
NA,a better standard of living in retirement. Quite,17
NA,"frankly, I am amazed. People would wonder",17
NA,why the Leader of the Opposition said in a,17
NA,doorstop on 18 August this year:,17
NA,.. ' . I don't believe that occupational superannua-,17
NA,tion makes any sense in a country like Australia.,17
NA,People would be asking: what is the policy,17
NA,prescription of the Leader of the Opposition?,17
NA,Anyone listening to the ABC on 31 July this,17
NA,year might have heard him say:,17
NA,People can prepare for their superannuation (by),17
NA,not only putting it into a few superannuation funds,17
NA,"... the:>: may save in banks, they may keep their",17
NA,money In a stockmarket and invest in equity,17
NA,themselves.,17
NA,I do not know when it was that the Leader of,17
NA,"the Opposition went back to Welfare Avenue,",17
NA,but I doubt whether his old neighbours have,17
NA,the Reuters screen installed next to their beds.,17
NA,The regrettable fact is that not enough,17
NA,Australians have had the capacity to provide,17
NA,adequately for their retirement. The Leader of,17
NA,the Opposition needs to recognise that not,17
NA,many Australians fit his computer driven,17
NA,"model. Through non-compliance, many do not",17
NA,"have any superannuation cover, and the",17
NA,present level of award superannuation cover,17
NA,is insufficient to provide a reasonable,17
NA,standard of living in retirement. We cannot,17
NA,afford to dismiss this problem for later on. It,17
NA,takes in excess of 30 years for ordinary wage,17
NA,and salary earners to save sufficient money to,17
NA,finance an adequate retirement income. With,17
NA,the first of the baby-boomers reaching 65 by,17
NA,"the year 2011, there is no practical alternative",17
NA,to the current timetable.,17
NA,The Leader of the Opposition has tried a,17
NA,"scare campaign, suggesting that occupational",17
NA,"superannuation will cost 100,000 jobs; and he",17
NA,is using the recession to suggest that this is,17
NA,"not the time for reform. Of course, for the",17
NA,"Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal Party",18
NA,"and the Opposition in general, it is never the",18
NA,time for any reform. The Leader of the,18
NA,Opposition ignores the facts. No employer,18
NA,will face an indease in superannuation contri-,18
NA,butions under these arrangements before 1,18
NA,"July 1992, by which time the recovery will be",18
NA,well under way.,18
NA,Mr Reith-I'll tell you what: you will eat,18
NA,those words.,18
Mr KERIN,Those opposite put on a,18
NA,wholesale sales tax. What do they want-19,18
NA,per cent inflation like New Zealand had? That,18
NA,is a good way to stymie recovery.,18
NA,Mr Reith-You tell that to the unem-,18
NA,ployed. That is absolute hypocrisy.,18
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Order! The,18
NA,member for Flinders!,18
Mr KERIN,New Zealand had 19 per cent,18
NA,inflation and interest rates of 25 per cent. This,18
NA,is the prescription that those opposite put,18
NA,forward. Where are the jobs in that? Honour-,18
NA,able members opposite are berserk. The,18
NA,Leader of the Opposition ignores the fact that,18
NA,for many employers who are already comply-,18
NA,ing with the 3 per cent obligation there will,18
NA,be no additional increase until 1 July 1993.,18
NA,He ignores the fact that improvements in,18
NA,superannuation will be taken into account in,18
NA,future award negotiations.,18
NA,"No, we will not be scrapping occupational",18
NA,"superannuation; no, we will not be scrapping",18
NA,"100,000 jobs; no, we will not be scrapping",18
NA,the welfare of future Australian retirees.,18
NA,Unemployment,18
Mr TIM FISCHER,My question is,18
NA,"directed to the Prime Minister, and it follows",18
NA,up on behalf of the one million jobless. The,18
NA,"Victorian Premier, Mrs Kirner, said that she",18
NA,has been telling him for some time that what,18
NA,we need in this country is a 'national jobs,18
NA,policy'. Now that this Labor Premier has,18
NA,confirmed that the Federal Government does,18
NA,"not have a jobs policy, and given the impact",18
NA,"of the drought, when will the Prime Minister",18
NA,face up to his responsibilities and put in place,18
NA,policies that will create long term economic,18
NA,growth and sustainable jobs?,18
Mr HAWKE,I remind the Leader of the,18
NA,National Party of something that I pointed out,18
NA,\n the House some time ago about the impact,18
NA,of the policies that the honourable member is,18
NA,advocating.,18
NA,Mr Beale-What about Kirner?,18
Mr HAWKE,We will come to the Premi-,18
NA,"er of Victoria in a moment, if the honourable",18
NA,member will just contain himself. Honourable,18
NA,members opposite should recall that what they,18
NA,are advocating to deal with employment in,18
NA,this country is a goods and services tax. I,18
NA,want to remind them of some figures that I,18
NA,gave recently about what happened in New,18
NA,Zealand with the introduction of a broad,18
NA,"based consumption tax. In New Zealand, since",18
NA,"the introduction of the consumption tax,",18
NA,employment has fallen by 6 per cent. That is,18
NA,what has happened in New Zealand. Honour-,18
NA,able members cannot just wipe New Zealand,18
NA,"off, because every one of the Opposition's",18
NA,shadow Ministers is beating a path across,18
NA,there. They want to make Australia a nation,18
NA,of Kiwis. New Zealand is their role model. I,18
NA,do not think that that is something to which,18
NA,"Australians particularly look forward, but that",18
NA,is what honourable members opposite want to,18
NA,do. They say that this is the example that they,18
NA,want to follow.,18
NA,"I tell the gentleman who asked the question,",18
NA,"the Leader of the National Party that, since",18
NA,the broad based consumption tax was intro-,18
NA,"duced in New Zealand, employment has fallen",18
NA,by almost 6 per cent. At the same time in this,18
NA,"country, including the employment losses of",18
NA,"the most recent period, there has been a 9 per",18
NA,cent increase in employment. That is a 15 per,18
NA,cent difference. That is what honourable,18
NA,members opposite would do to this country.,18
NA,They would smash any opportunity for eco-,18
NA,nomic recovery. Just as this has happened in,18
NA,"New Zealand, so it would happen here.",18
NA,The situation is that the record of this,18
NA,"Government is, as I have said before in this",18
NA,"place, the creation of 177,000 jobs per annum,",18
NA,"on average, since we have been in",18
NA,government. Honourable members opposite,18
NA,had their opportunity. We have created jobs,18
NA,three times faster than honourable members,18
NA,opposite created them when they were in,18
NA,government. The honourable member opposite,18
NA,"can shake his unknowing head, but he cannot",19
NA,change the statistics. Our rate of employment,19
NA,creation is three times greater than that of,19
NA,honourable members opposite.,19
NA,While employment in New Zealand-the,19
NA,country which the Opposition uses as its,19
NA,model and on which it wants to base its,19
NA,experiment in this country-was going down,19
NA,"by 6 per cent, Australia's was up by 9 per",19
NA,"cent, a difference of a million jobs.",19
NA,Mr Tim Fischer- Mrs Kirner?,19
Mr HAWKE,We have pointed out-it is,19
NA,true for the Premier of Victoria; it is true for,19
NA,everyone in the State-that one cannot change,19
NA,the statistics. The statistics are very simple,19
NA,and I will remind the Leader of the National,19
NA,Party what they were and what we had to deal,19
NA,with. We had a situation in this country where,19
NA,expenditure was increasing twice as fast as,19
NA,production. The Leader of the National Party,19
NA,will admit in the privacy of his room that if,19
NA,we had not slowed down the Australian,19
NA,economy the world would have imposed a,19
NA,much more drastic solution upon us. That is,19
NA,"the fact, so we had to slow the economy",19
NA,down.,19
NA,Now we are starting to see the indisputable,19
NA,signs of recovery which will mean that in the,19
NA,second half of this financial year employment,19
NA,"will grow, and it will grow on a much more",19
NA,secure base. As part of the slowing down of,19
NA,"the Australian economy, which had to be",19
NA,"done in those circumstances, we now have a",19
NA,position which is distinct from any other,19
NA,"recession out of which this country has come,",19
NA,including what those opposite gave us. We,19
NA,inherited their recession. What was the infla-,19
NA,tion rate that they gave us? It was 11.2 per,19
NA,cent. They gave us a massive recession but,19
NA,they could not do anything about inflation-it,19
NA,was still 11.2 per cent. So we had to bring,19
NA,this country out of recession in 1983 with an,19
NA,inherited inflation rate of 11.2 per cent.,19
NA,"Certainly, we had to recess the economy-",19
NA,"that has happened. But now, in the process,",19
NA,because of the range of relevant policies we,19
NA,will have in this year an inflation rate of,19
NA,"cent, which is significantly less than that of",19
NA,our major trading partners. That will mean,19
NA,that Australian industry will be increasingly,19
NA,competitive. It will mean that jobs that we,19
NA,"will create, as we go back to the sorts of",19
NA,standards of job creation that we have had,19
NA,"over our period of government, will be more",19
NA,secure in an Australian economy which is,19
NA,significantly more competitive than it has ever,19
NA,been before.,19
NA,We have had the courage to bring in the,19
NA,processes of micro-economic reform about,19
NA,which all those opposite have ever done is,19
NA,heehaw. They have never done anything about,19
NA,it. They are the people who kept tariff rates,19
NA,"as high as they possibly could be, which",19
NA,rendered our industry uncompetitive. They,19
NA,never did anything about our transport infra-,19
NA,structure in order to make it more competi-,19
NA,tive. All they did was talk. They never did,19
NA,anything.,19
NA,They gave to this country in 1983 a legacy,19
NA,of a taxation system which was the worst in,19
NA,the world-a totally unreformed infrastruc-,19
NA,ture. We have changed those things. That,19
NA,"means that as we come out of this recession,",19
NA,"as we will and as we are doing now, we will",19
NA,be able to resume the employment growth,19
NA,which has characterised all the previous,19
NA,period of the Hawke Labor Government.,19
NA,Housing,19
Mr KERR,My question is to the Minister,19
NA,"for Health, Housing and Community Services.",19
NA,What is the significance of the most recent,19
NA,ABS figures on housing finance approvals and,19
NA,dwelling approvals?,19
Mr HOWE,I thank the honourable,19
NA,member for Denison for his question. Obvi-,19
NA,"ously, as the Prime Minister has been indicat-",19
NA,"ing in regard to the signs of recovery, in-",19
NA,creased activity in the housing industry is an,19
NA,early indicator of broader economic recovery.,19
NA,Recently released figures from the ABS,19
NA,suggest that we will see broader steady,19
NA,recovery over the course of the year.,19
NA,The statistics for housing finance in July,19
NA,this year show that the number of loan ap-,19
NA,provals for owner occupied dwellings in-,19
NA,creased by 8 per cent over June and by 36 per,19
NA,3 per cent compared with July last year. More,19
NA,"importantly, loan approvals over the three-",19
NA,month period to July this year increased by,19
NA,"23 per cent over the previous three months,",19
NA,with demand growing strongly in this period.,19
NA,Statistics also show that in the three months,20
NA,to August dwelling approvals increased by 8,20
NA,per cent over the previous three months.,20
NA,Figures froIll the Housing Industry,20
NA,Association for the same period show that net,20
NA,sales of houses increased by 21 per cent.,20
NA,These trend increases are moderated by slight,20
NA,"declines in August, which indicate that growth",20
NA,is proceeding at a moderate pace. There is no,20
NA,sign that the housing market will overheat.,20
NA,"Overall increased demand, assisted by",20
NA,"declining home loan interest rates, should",20
NA,flow through to a significant increase in,20
NA,housing commencements in the September,20
NA,"quarter. This is, of course, consistent with the",20
NA,Indicative Planning Council's forecast of an,20
NA,increase in dwelling commencements to,20
NA,"135,000 in 1991-92. Increased activity will",20
NA,generate employment opportunities not only,20
NA,in the building industry but also in the com-,20
NA,"ponents of production, industry and retail",20
NA,trade.,20
NA,Consistent with the answer to the previous,20
NA,"question, we are beginning to see the early",20
NA,signs of a steady recovery. That is particularly,20
NA,"reflected in the area of housing. Of course, it",20
NA,is against that background that the issue ?f,20
NA,taxation is clearly so important. In Austraha,20
NA,most building materials are exempt from,20
NA,"wholesale sales tax. Indeed, it represents only",20
NA,about one per cent of the cost of a new home.,20
NA,Even allowing for the abolition of wholesale,20
NA,"sales tax and fuel excise, a goods and services",20
NA,tax of 12112 per cent would increase the extent,20
NA,to which new houses are taxed by some 10,20
NA,per cent.,20
NA,Mr Reith-Where did you get that figure,20
NA,from?,20
Mr HOWE,I will tell the honourable,20
NA,member what I can get. I can get this particu-,20
NA,"lar clipping, which indicates the views of Ron",20
NA,Silberberg of the Housing Industry,20
NA,Association on the impact of a goods and,20
NA,services tax on the housing industry in this,20
NA,country. Ron Silberberg is quite independent,20
NA,"of the Government and is someone who, I",20
NA,"understand, is not uncritical these days of the",20
NA,Opposition's policies. He talks about the,20
NA,impact under a 15 per cent tax. He suggests,20
NA,"that the cost of a $130,000 house and land",20
NA,"package would increase by $10,000. He says",20
NA,that that is a ferocious impact and that the,20
NA,difficulty for new home buyers is that it is all,20
NA,front-end loading.,20
NA,We have an Opposition that decries any,20
NA,sign of recovery; we have an Opposition that,20
NA,says that it wants to go forward into -ew,20
NA,policies in relation to the goods and servIces,20
NA,tax; and we have an Opposition that says that,20
NA,"that tax ought to be a comprehensive tax, that",20
NA,"is, it ought to be as simple and cle-. as",20
NA,possible. So the Housing Industry ASSOCIatIOn,20
NA,makes its assessment; it sees What the tax,20
NA,means. It means that new home buyers-,20
NA,people at a stage which obviously is not,20
NA,lacking in difficulties-are going to be loaded,20
NA,"with a $10,000 impost or something of that",20
NA,order in terms of a new tax with all of the,20
NA,consequences in terms of employment and all,20
NA,of the opportunities to abort the recovery that,20
NA,I have been speaking about.,20
NA,I conclude by simply saying that the,20
NA,Government is pleased to see the genuine,20
NA,signs of recovery that are occurring in the,20
NA,Opposition. We are horrified by the prospect,20
NA,of what Ron Silberberg calls a ferocious tax,20
NA,that might be imposed by the Opposition if,20
NA,ever the opportunity came up.,20
NA,Medicare,20
Dr BOB WOODS,My question is direct-,20
NA,ed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the,20
NA,Government has still not finalised its Budget,20
NA,decision on Medicare? Is it also a fact that,20
NA,Caucus is divided on the matter? Given that,20
NA,the Government is clearly split over health,20
NA,"policy, is it a fact that, if you cannot govern",20
NA,"yourself, you cannot govern the country?",20
Mr HAWKE,I am afraid that I cannot,20
NA,resist the temptation. If we are going to have,20
NA,"questions about health care policy, it is an",20
NA,appropriate moment to-,20
Dr HEWSON ,Come on. We support you on,20
NA,this one and you cannot even deliver.,20
Mr HAWKE,We will see about the,20
NA,credentials of these people opposite to speak,20
NA,about health policy. I remind the House of the,20
NA,immortal words of Mr Shack.,20
NA,An honourable member-Just put it on,20
NA,CD.,20
Mr HAWKE,"We will, I think. This is",21
NA,what he had to say on 25 January 1990. They,21
NA,"were great words, Peter, particularly the",21
NA,"second paragraph, which is not always men-",21
NA,tioned. The second paragraph really is better,21
NA,than the first. The first paragraph-and this,21
NA,was the Liberals on health policy-reads:,21
NA,Now I want to say to you with all the frankness,21
NA,that I can muster-,21
NA,"and that is not a lot, but on this occasion it",21
NA,was a good deal. He said:,21
NA,the Liberal and National Parties do not have a,21
NA,particularly good track record in health and you,21
NA,don't need me to remind you of our last period in,21
NA,government.,21
NA,And unless they are the world's greatest,21
NA,"masochists, they would never want to be",21
NA,reminded of their record in health during their,21
NA,last period in government. But the next,21
NA,paragraph was even better.,21
Dr HEWSON ,They are asleep; look at,21
NA,them.,21
Mr HAWKE,"Yes, look at them, they are",21
NA,laughing-and they will be laughing in a,21
NA,moment.,21
NA,Opposition members interjecting-,21
Mr HAWKE,Opposition members will,21
NA,not divert attention from the next paragraph.,21
NA,This is what Mr Shack had to say:,21
NA,You might accuse us of a lot of things but one of,21
NA,the things I don't think we are guilty of is learning,21
NA,from our past mistakes.,21
NA,"Well, he was right. Those opposite do not",21
NA,learn from their mistakes: they have not,21
NA,produced a health policy; they still do,21
NA,have one. We on this side of the Parliament,21
NA,have a health policy in operation which is,21
NA,endorsed by over 70 per cent of the speculation,21
NA,Australian electorate. They are the facts.,21
NA,than 70 per cent of the Australian people,21
NA,endorse the health policy of this Government.,21
NA,Opposition members-Where is your undertaken.,21
NA,policy?,21
Mr HAWKE,We have a policy; those It is,21
NA,opposite do not. At this time we have a,21
NA,process under way: the Caucus has been given,21
NA,"the opportunity, as it should be given",21
NA,"opportunity, of examining proposals put responsibility",21
NA,forward in the Budget. That process will go kind.,21
NA,"on through this week. Out of this process, the",21
NA,contrast will still remain: on this side of the,21
NA,"House, a Party and a government which have",21
NA,"a relevant, compassionate, universal, equitable",21
NA,"health policy; on the other side, none.",21
NA,Joint Venture by Australia Post and,21
NA,Australian Airlines,21
Mr OKEEFE ,My question is addressed,21
NA,to the Minister for Land Transport. I refer the,21
NA,Minister to-,21
NA,Mr Beale-Who?,21
Mr OKEEFE ,The Minister for Land,21
NA,"Transport, Bob Brown.",21
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,The honourable,21
NA,member for Burke will ask his question.,21
Mr OKEEFE ,I ask the Minister for,21
NA,Land Transport about recent speculation that,21
NA,Australia Post and Australian Airlines were,21
NA,looking at forming a joint venture. Is the,21
NA,Minister aware of that speculation? Can he,21
NA,inform the House on the situation?,21
NA,"Mr Tim Fischer Mr Acting Speaker, I",21
NA,rise on a point of order. The honourable,21
NA,member made a mistake by using the term,21
NA,'speCUlation'. Standing order 144(g) states,21
NA,that a question should not contain 'hypotheti-,21
NA,cal matter' as well as other aspects. That,21
NA,question clearly has been badly drafted and is,21
NA,out of order.,21
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,The question is,21
NA,in order. The Minister for Land Transport.,21
Mr ROBERT BROWN,I thank the,21
NA,not honourable member for Burke for the ques-,21
NA,tion. I acknowledge his vigilance in relation,21
NA,to questions of this kind. I am aware of the,21
NA,which surrounded the possibility,21
NA,More of some type of joint venture between,21
NA,Australia Post and Australian Airlines. I am,21
NA,"delighted, as well, to have this opportunity to",21
NA,indicate that such a joint venture has been,21
NA,It was announced this morning by,21
NA,the managing directors of both those bodies.,21
NA,particularly important as far as the public,21
NA,"sector generally is concerned, because both",21
NA,these government business enterprises have,21
NA,the been given a commercial charter with the,21
NA,of pursuing initiatives of this,21
NA,We can all feel particularly pleased about,22
NA,"the fact that, when corporations of that kind",22
NA,are given the opportunity to pursue commer-,22
NA,"cial imperatives, they willingly undertake that",22
NA,"responsibility -d, on occasions of this kind,",22
NA,they take advantage as well of the possibility,22
NA,of initiatives being pursued. As honourable,22
NA,"members know, and for some particular",22
NA,reasons which the honourable member in his,22
NA,capacity as Chairman of the Government's,22
NA,transport and communications committee,22
NA,"brought to my attention, there is a number of",22
NA,important spin-offs from this. I know the,22
NA,honourable member for Burke is delighted to,22
NA,hear that the announcement has been made.,22
NA,We expect that the joint venture will be,22
NA,undertaken sometime early next year. It will,22
NA,make . it possible to bring together all the,22
NA,existing customer contacts that we have been,22
NA,able to develop through Australia Post with,22
NA,all the freight expertise and a lot of the,22
NA,electronic arrangements that have been built,22
NA,into the operations of Australian Airlines. As,22
NA,Australian Airlines is one of those,22
NA,government business enterprises that the,22
NA,Government has been looking at in order to,22
NA,rationalise public sector involvement and,22
NA,"public sector ownership, the proposed joint",22
NA,venture is even more relevant.,22
NA,As far as contact with customers-with the,22
NA,"community-is concerned, the joint venture",22
NA,"will have access to 1,400 post office outlets",22
NA,"in Australia and another 3,100 post office",22
NA,agencies. The joint venture will make it,22
NA,possible for that to spread into rural and,22
NA,remote Australia and to bring together all the,22
NA,existing functions of those two operations. We,22
NA,have the well-developed courier service which,22
NA,"is now being operated by Australia Post,",22
NA,together with the well-developed freight,22
NA,service which is operated by Australian,22
NA,Airlines. Each day there would be about 200,22
NA,separate air movements that would be able to,22
NA,contribute towards the development of that,22
NA,"service. Also, a considerable number of",22
NA,separate operations presently being pursued,22
NA,by both of those companies will be brought,22
NA,together.,22
NA,The whole operation will provide a signifi-,22
NA,cant share of domestic air express business,22
NA,"among air courier services, both express",22
NA,parcels and air freight. I know this will be,22
NA,dependent on a decision by government to,22
NA,endorse the joint venture. I do not believe,22
NA,there would be any likelihood of its being,22
NA,delayed.,22
NA,The proposal certainly has my goodwill and,22
NA,my support. It is an extremely important,22
NA,initiative that has been undertaken by,22
NA,government business enterprises operating,22
NA,under the reforms which have been introduced,22
NA,by the Hawke Labor Government. As a result,22
NA,"of that, these government business enterprises",22
NA,are doing a much more effective job for the,22
NA,"Australian people through the public sector,",22
NA,and I have no doubt that this will be another,22
NA,outstanding success on the part of two very,22
NA,significant and important government business,22
NA,enterprises.,22
NA,Interest Rates,22
Mr REITH,Does the Treasurer agree with,22
NA,"his senior colleague Senator Button, who",22
NA,today in Question Time in the Senate has,22
NA,ruled out a further drop in interest rates of,22
NA,one per cent?,22
Mr KERIN,We have appropriate mecha-,22
NA,nisms in place for dealing with monetary,22
NA,policy on an ongoing basis. I am not in the,22
NA,business of fattening people's pockets by,22
NA,speculating about interest rates; we will,22
NA,follow due process. The only person who,22
NA,really got the last drop in interest rates com-,22
NA,pletely wrong was the Leader of the Opposi-,22
NA,tion in his totally unprincipled attack on the,22
NA,Governor of the Reserve Bank-,22
Dr HEWSON ,You have got it wrong.,22
Mr KERIN,The Leader of the Opposition,22
NA,has it completely wrong. His attack on the,22
NA,Governor of the Reserve Bank not only was,22
NA,unprincipled but also probably was actionable.,22
NA,He completely misunderstands the relationship,22
NA,between the Reserve Bank and the,22
NA,Government.,22
NA,Power Stations,22
Mr LEE,My question is directed to the,22
NA,Minister for Resources.,22
NA,"Mr MCGauran-Here he is, Kerry",22
NA,Packer's little mate.,22
Mr LEE,It concerns the electricity indus-,22
NA,try and the future of those working at power,22
NA,stations on the central coast of New South,23
NA,Wales. Is he aware of claims made in,23
NA,yesterday's Australian Financial Review that,23
NA,current State Government plans to allow,23
NA,private investment in power stations will not,23
NA,result in significant competition or micro-,23
NA,economic reform of this industry? What steps,23
NA,have been taken to improve the efficiency of,23
NA,the Australian electricity industry?,23
Mr GRIFFITHS,I thank the honourable,23
NA,member for Dobell for his question. It is,23
NA,known to members of the House that in his,23
NA,former role the honourable member for Dobell,23
NA,was regarded as one of the finest electrical,23
NA,"engineers since Edison; accordingly, he has an",23
NA,ongoing interest in these matters.,23
NA,It is clear to members of the House that,23
NA,electricity is a key component in determining,23
NA,"costs and competitiveness and, accordingly,",23
NA,the real level of our incomes. This industry,23
NA,a very significant one. It has capital assets,23
NA,"the order of $100 billion, and sales in excess",23
NA,of $10 billion annually. In that context it,23
NA,"ought to be put in some perspective, and the",23
NA,perspective is that as an industry in value,23
NA,"adding terms and capital terms it is, for",23
NA,"example, significantly bigger than our motor",23
NA,vehicle industry and many times larger than,23
NA,"our iron and steel industries and, accordingly,",23
NA,a major industry for government attention. It,23
NA,"did not have much government attention, I",23
NA,"might say, for many decades. Just a few",23
NA,"weeks ago when-rhetorically, I admit-I",23
NA,asked members of the Opposition to name but,23
NA,one significant micro-economic reform in,23
NA,"their nearly three decades of government,",23
NA,there was a barren silence. This is just a,23
NA,matter for record: the Opposition comes to,23
NA,this issue with not a very good record at all.,23
NA,"If I may go back to the issue, it goes",23
NA,"without saying that the supply of reliable, low",23
NA,cost and clean energy is essential to underlie,23
NA,our economic well-being and our future,23
NA,prosperity. That is why the Commonwealth,23
NA,has taken a very significant role in recent,23
NA,"developments which, of course, go to the",23
NA,development of a national electricity grid. The,23
NA,catalyst for these very dramatic reforms was,23
NA,the Government's new federalism mechanism,23
NA,which has seen the establishment of a,23
NA,National Electricity Grid Council. To reflect,23
NA,the Government's views on the importance of,23
NA,"that mechanism, it is worth informing the",23
NA,House that the Commonwealth nominee is Mr,23
NA,"Geoff Miller, the Secretary to the Department",23
NA,of Primary Industries and Energy. It is a very,23
NA,significant body with significant potential.,23
NA,In terms of the working together for the,23
NA,national interest-the common good-there,23
NA,will be very major developments arising out,23
NA,of this process. I think the first and most,23
NA,obvious one is prospectively very significant,23
NA,cost reductions in electricity prices but of,23
NA,"equal importance is that, to the extent that we",23
NA,can gamer greater efficiency at a national,23
NA,"level, we of course have less call on our",23
NA,"resources and, therefore, we have better",23
NA,environmental outcomes. There will be sig-,23
NA,nificant benefits to all Australians.,23
NA,"Just before I conclude, it is worth making",23
NA,is this point: in a few short years Australia's,23
NA,in electricity has moved from being the seventh,23
NA,"cheapest in the OECD to now being, accord-",23
NA,"ing to the most recent reports, the third least",23
NA,expensive in the OECD. We are getting better,23
NA,"fast, but I think the Commonwealth's role in",23
NA,terms of acting as a catalyst to bring about,23
NA,"these further and very significant reforms,",23
NA,"particularly, as I say, in the context of a",23
NA,"national electricity grid, can potentially move",23
NA,"us not to third best in the OECD but, even",23
NA,with the challenge of some of our competitors,23
NA,"with their hydro-electricity, to a position",23
NA,"where we can genuinely, in my view, aim for",23
NA,world's best.,23
NA,"Mr Lee Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a",23
NA,point of order. I am informed by one of my,23
NA,colleagues that the honourable member for,23
NA,Gippsland referred to me as 'Packer'S little,23
NA,mate' at the start of the answer to my ques-,23
NA,tion. I assume that is a reference to my,23
NA,chairmanship of the print media inquiry. I,23
NA,find that offensive and ask him to withdraw.,23
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,I have to say,23
NA,that the Chair did not hear that interjection. I,23
NA,would only rely upon the judgment of the,23
NA,honourable member for Gippsland as to,23
NA,whether or not he made that remark. If he did,23
NA,"so, clearly it is appropriate to withdraw.",23
NA,Mr MCGauran-It is not appropriate to,23
NA,withdraw.,23
NA,"Mr Thckey- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a",24
NA,point of order. Does the honourable member,24
NA,consider being called 'Packer's mate' an,24
NA,insult?,24
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,The honourable,24
NA,member for 0' Connor has no point of order.,24
NA,Interest Rates,24
Mr REITH,My question is addressed to,24
NA,the Treasurer. Given the Treasurer's last,24
NA,"answer, is he saying that it was inappropriate",24
NA,for Senator Button to make such comments on,24
NA,interest rates?,24
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-Yes or no?,24
Mr KERIN,No.,24
NA,Waste Water Treatment,24
Mr ALLAN MORRIS,I direct my ques-,24
NA,"tion to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the",24
NA,"Environment, Tourism and Territories. Is the",24
NA,Minister aware of an article in today's,24
NA,Australian claiming that the Australian waste,24
NA,water treatment company Memtec is about to,24
NA,move offshore because of a lack of State,24
NA,government support and the absence of,24
NA,national water quality standards? What are the,24
NA,implications for water quality management in,24
NA,Australia? What progress has been made in,24
NA,the development of national standards?,24
Mrs KELLY , I thank the honourable,24
NA,member for his question and for his continu-,24
NA,ing interest in Australian industry. I am aware,24
NA,and I am very concerned that the Australian,24
NA,company Memtec is considering moving its,24
NA,main base of operations overseas. The Federal,24
NA,Government has been very supportive of,24
NA,Memtec's research and development program.,24
NA,"It has already provided, through the Depart-",24
NA,"ment of Industry, Technology and Commerce,",24
NA,"over $3.6m to Memtec, with a further $1.1m",24
NA,committed. So the Government has been very,24
NA,supportive of this new technology.,24
NA,This technology is important to Australia,24
NA,because it offers the prospect of very high,24
NA,quality waste water treatment for our cities,24
NA,and our country areas. It provides a clean,24
NA,alternative to offshore disposal of inadequatethat,24
NA,ly treated sewage. It is important to note,24
NA,the Memtec technology is not just concepts,24
NA,on the drawing board. Memtec is a substantial,24
NA,company and there is a great deal of interest,24
NA,in it overseas. It already has a small plant,24
NA,operating out of Blackheath in the Blue,24
NA,Mountains. It is a very good example of the,24
NA,clever country at work.,24
NA,"Unfortunately, the New South Wales",24
NA,Government has promised a great deal to,24
NA,"Memtec, and to people in New South Wales,",24
NA,"but has not delivered. Last year, on 27 June",24
NA,"1990, at a press conference between the",24
NA,"Minister for Environment, Mr Tim Moore; the",24
NA,"Premier, Mr Nick Greiner; and also the Water",24
NA,Board a commitment was given that they,24
NA,would be proceeding with a $20m Memtec,24
NA,filtration plant in Cronulla in Sydney. On that,24
NA,date Mr Greiner said that the Sydney Water,24
NA,Board remained prepared to take responsible,24
NA,risks to seek to provide better than tertiary,24
NA,treatment standards at plants such as Cronulla,24
NA,where this could be achieved by using this,24
NA,radical new Australian technology. But what,24
NA,has happened? Nothing.,24
NA,"Mr Thckey Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a",24
NA,point of order. Standing order 142 says:,24
NA,Questions may be put to a Minister relating to,24
NA,"public affairs with which he is officially connected,",24
NA,"to proceedings pending in the House, or to any",24
NA,matter of administration for which he is respon-,24
NA,sible.,24
NA,The Minister is now giving us a case for State,24
NA,"government support of an industry, which I",24
NA,find hardly within the parameters of her,24
NA,portfolio responsibility in this House. She,24
NA,could even do as the honourable member for,24
NA,Lalor once used to do and tell us about some,24
NA,"new developments, but she is putting a case",24
NA,which is quite commercial and appears to be,24
NA,within the realm of a State government. I,24
NA,think her answer is totally irrelevant.,24
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,The Minister is,24
NA,still within the boundaries of the question that,24
NA,"was asked. However, I am listening to the",24
NA,answer of the Minister.,24
Mrs KELLY,That shows how little those,24
NA,opposite know about the priorities of this,24
NA,"portfolio, because waste water is a major",24
NA,environmental issue in this country. I wish,24
NA,it was a priority for the New South Wales,24
NA,"that Government. Unfortunately, all the New",24
NA,South Wales Government has done is put out,24
NA,a press release about it and given a commit-,24
NA,ment to a company which has already provid-,24
NA,"ed infrastructure, but it will not sign the",25
NA,"contract. What has this company, a very good",25
NA,"Australian company, got to do? Now it has",25
NA,got to look overseas. I think that is a,25
NA,shame for Australian industry and for the,25
NA,environment.,25
NA,From the Federal Government's point of,25
NA,view-and the Opposition might like to listen,25
NA,"to this-it would be very unfortunate, I",25
NA,"believe, if Memtec were to be forced offshore. settled.",25
NA,"I say that because the Commonwealth,",25
NA,through the recently announced Environment,25
NA,"Protection Agency, will be involved in the",25
NA,development of national environmental quality,25
NA,"standards, including standards of water",25
NA,ty. This will be done in cooperation with,25
NA,State governments through mechanisms being,25
NA,developed through the inter-governmental,25
NA,agreement on the environment.,25
NA,There is no doubt that these standards will 1.,25
NA,be extremely rigorous and will require the,25
NA,best available technology to meet them. This,25
NA,is hardly surprising given that clean,25
NA,one of Australia's scarcest commodities. It,25
NA,would be crazy to force a home grown,25
NA,company offshore when that company has,25
NA,developed technology which is amongst the,25
NA,most advanced water treatment technologies,25
NA,in the world. Not only would we reduce our,25
NA,options to achieve high water quality but we,25
NA,would lose the opportunity to generate huge,25
NA,export dollars.,25
Mr HAWKE ," Mr Speaker, I ask that further",25
NA,questions be placed on the Notice Paper.,25
NA,"Mr Lee Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a",25
NA,point of order. I understand that under the,25
NA,Standing Orders it is up to you to decide,25
NA,whether a member should be required to,25
NA,withdraw an allegation against another. I,25
NA,understand that the honourable member for,25
NA,"Gippsland, in response to you, said that it is",25
NA,not appropriate that it be withdrawn. I am,25
NA,wondering whether he should be asked whe-,25
NA,ther he made the statement that I am,25
NA,'Packer's little mate'.,25
NA,Mr MCGauran-If the honourable member,25
NA,"feels hurt or wounded in any way, I am happy",25
NA,to withdraw. But I do not like the sleazebag,25
NA,"Minister for Education prompting him, given",25
NA,his record on Reid and the others in the,25
NA,1980s. The Minister has been tutoring him for,25
NA,the last five minutes.,25
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Order! The,25
NA,great honourable member for Gippsland will not,25
NA,abuse the privilege of the chamber by speak-,25
NA,ing in such a manner. Members of the,25
NA,Government did not assist the honourable,25
NA,member for Gippsland in his process of,25
NA,withdrawal. I believe that the matter is now,25

NA,misrepresented?,26
Mr HOWARD,Yes.,26
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,The honourable,26
NA,member may proceed.,26
Mr HOWARD,In today's Australian,26
NA,there is a report regarding proceedings of the,26
NA,Western Australian Inc. royal commission. In,26
NA,a story under the by-line of Jane Hammond,26
NA,it is said:,26
NA,"The former leader of the Opposition, Mr John",26
NA,"Howard, and the former West Australian Liberal",26
NA,"senator, Mr Fred Chaney, strongly supported the",26
NA,West Australian government's decision to indemni-,26
NA,"fy a $150 million line of credit to Rothwell's Bank,",26
NA,the WA royal commission heard yesterday.,26
NA,Apparently that is a report of some evidence,26
NA,given by the former Deputy Premier of,26
NA,"Western Australia, Mr David Parker. The",26
NA,"report goes on to say that Mr Tony Oates,",26
NA,"who I understand was, is or has been a",26
NA,member of the Liberal Party in Western,26
NA,"Australia, was a Bond Corporation director at",26
NA,the time and he allegedly told Parker that he,26
NA,had discussed the matter on the telephone,26
NA,with both me and the honourable member for.,26
NA,Pearce.,26
NA,That report is totally incorrect. At no stage,26
NA,have I voiced to anybody any support for the,26
NA,provision by the Western Australian,26
NA,"Government of a line of credit. It is true, as",26
NA,"I told the House some weeks ago, that during'",26
NA,"the weekend of the Rothwells bail out, Mr",26
NA,Bond telephoned me complaining that Mr,26
NA,"Barry MACKinnon, the Leader of the Liberal",26
NA,"Party in Western Australia, would not cooper-",26
NA,ate in giving a political indemnity to the,26
NA,Report Burke Government in relation to the,26
NA,Government guarantee. That was the first I,26
NA,knew of Mr MACKinnon's role and the first I,26
NA,knew of the bail out. I subsequently spoke to,26
NA,"Mr MACKinnon, who explained his position.",26
NA,I then rang Mr Bond back and told him that,26
NA,as far as I was concerned if private sector,26
NA,people wanted to put money in to bail out,26
NA,"Rothwells that was fine, I certainly would not",26
NA,offer any criticism of that and I could under-,26
NA,stand some positive reasons for it occurring.,26
NA,"However, I made it perfectly clear that it",26
NA,was not a case for government involvement,26
NA,and that I totally supported Mr MACKinnon's,26
NA,"position. I also understand, in fairness to him,",26
NA,that that was the position consistently taken,26
NA,by the former Senator Chaney and he has,26
NA,issued a press release to that effect today. I,26
NA,categorically deny the allegation that I in any,26
NA,way supported it. I also deny having had any,26
NA,contact with Mr Oates on the matter as,26
NA,alleged. I do not remember having met the,26
NA,"man; I may have received a letter from him,",26
NA,but I certainly do not recall any personal,26
NA,approach. So the claim is completely and,26
NA,utterly untrue.,26
NA,Mr DUBOIS {St George)- Mr Acting,26
NA,"Speaker, I wish to make a personal explan-",26
NA,ation.,26
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Does the,26
NA,honourable member claim to have been,26
NA,misrepresented?,26
Mr DUBOIS,I do.,26
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,The honourable,26
NA,member may proceed.,26
NA,Mr Beale-You are in favour of a third,26
NA,runway.,26
Mr DUBOIS,Just listen. In an article in,26
NA,the Sunday Telegraph of 8 September its,26
NA,correspondent Mark MCEvoy identified me as,26
NA,one of six Federal members publicly support-,26
NA,ing the councils against a third runway propo-,26
NA,sal. That is not true. I have never supported,26
NA,the councils. I do in fact support the third,26
NA,runway. The article went on to claim that I,26
NA,also endorsed a proposal to impose a $5 noise,26
NA,"tax plan, whereas I do not. All I know about",27
NA,that plan is that it would generate some,27
NA,income for the councils to distribute as they,27
NA,"see fit, and I think it is rather bizarre.",27
NA,The article went on to say that I was one,27
NA,"the six MPs who opposed a third runway,",27
NA,claiming that it would be cheaper to build,27
NA,new airport at Badgerys Creek. That is not,27
NA,true. It is clearly cheaper to build a third,27
NA,runway than to build a new airport at ister,27
NA,Badgerys Creek. I conclude by saying that,27
NA,long-suffering people of St George are lookaccountancy,27
NA,ing forward to some relief from aircraft noise,27
NA,when the third runway is built.,27
NA,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,27
NA,Wholesale Sales Tax System,27
Mr ACTING SPEAKER,I have received,27
NA,a letter from the honourable member for,27
NA,Mayo proposing that a definite matter of,27
NA,public importance be submitted to the House,27
NA,"for discussion, namely:",27
NA,The enormous cost to business of the outdated,27
NA,ramshackle wholesale sales tax system.,27
NA,I call upon those members who approve of,27
NA,the proposed discussion to rise in their,27
NA,More than the number of members required,27
NA,by the Standing Orders having risen in their,27
NA,places-,27
Mr DOWNER ,Mayo) (3.12 p.m.)-The,27
NA,current wholesale sales tax system in,27
NA,"Australia, which reaps something like $9.3",27
NA,"billion a year for the Government, is believed",27
NA,to be the oldest living tax system of a con-,27
NA,sumption kind left in the world. It is a tax,27
NA,system that was introduced before Winston,27
NA,Churchill became Prime Minister of Great,27
NA,"Britain, before the jet engine was invented,",27
NA,when sound was just coming to the movies,27
NA,and when the Prime Minister of Australia ( Mr,27
NA,Hawke) was a tiny baby. It is a taxation,27
NA,system which is so old that I believe it has,27
NA,"very real tourist potential, for as long",27
NA,lasts accountants will swarm to Australia from,27
NA,all over the world to look at this historic,27
NA,taxation system with disbelief that any,27
NA,government in the modem world could retain,27
NA,"a tax system so ancient, so decrepit and",27
NA,crippling to the business community of its,27
NA,country. They will find it indeed unbelievable.,27
NA,One only needs to begin by looking at the,27
NA,cost of the wholesale sales tax system to,27
NA,"business just of administering it, let alone the",27
NA,cost of paying it. I am not talking about the,27
NA,of payment of the tax; I am simply talking about,27
NA,the cost of administering it. Accountants in,27
NA,a Australia estimate that something like $400m,27
NA,a year is spent by the business community on,27
NA,salaries alone in employing people to admin-,27
NA,the wholesale sales tax system. It spends,27
NA,the something like $100m a year on legal and,27
NA,"fees, $14m on preparing whole-",27
NA,"sale sales tax returns and, for those who like",27
NA,"detail, $360,000 a year on posting the returns",27
NA,to the Australian Taxation Office. On top of,27
NA,that the Australian Taxation Office costs,27
NA,something like $23m worth of taxpayers',27
NA,money to administer its side of the wholesale,27
NA,sales tax system. So in monetary terms the,27
NA,wholesale sales tax system-just to administer,27
NA,it-is costing the business community in this,27
NA,country something like $500m per annum.,27
NA,There are a lot of reasons why it costs the,27
NA,and business community so much. One of the,27
NA,main reasons is that it costs so much in trying,27
NA,to establish within the business community,27
NA,places. how it can and should comply with the,27
NA,wholesale sales tax law. One of the great,27
NA,problems is that goods are taxed at different,27
NA,"rates. Some things are not taxed at all, of",27
NA,"course. Consequently, there is a whole range",27
NA,of borderline problems.,27
NA,Let us take the example of books. They are,27
NA,exempt from the wholesale sales tax unless,27
NA,"they are books of maps, in which case they",27
NA,are subject to a 10 per cent wholesale sales,27
NA,"tax rate, unless those books of maps are",27
NA,"marketed exclusively for use in schools,",27
NA,"colleges or universities, in which case they",27
NA,"revert to being exempt, unless they are of an",27
NA,"advertising nature, in which case they are",27
NA,taxable at 20 per cent. Somebody has to work,27
NA,"all that out, and that is where the $500m in",27
NA,as it administrative costs comes from.,27
NA,Many people who follow the issue of sales,27
NA,"tax will know of the very famous and, admit-",27
NA,"tedly, rather crude example of the difficulty",27
NA,of administering the tax in the edible under-,27
NA,so wear case. I do not know how many people,27
NA,"are aware of this product, edible underwear,",27
NA,but I have checked up and it exists. It is for,27
NA,sale in novelty shops. The edible underwear,28
NA,"case is a cause celebre, let me tell honourable",28
NA,"members, in the folklore of the wholesale",28
NA,sales tax system in Australia. What is edible,28
NA,underwear?,28
NA,"Mr Costello-No, don't tell us.",28
Mr DOWNER,In terms of taxation-I am,28
NA,not going to tell honourable members in detail,28
NA,"what it is; and I have never eaten any, let me",28
NA,"hasten to add-edible underwear, if defined",28
NA,"as clothes for human wear, is exempt from",28
NA,the wholesale sales tax. If it is defined as,28
NA,food for human consumption it is exempt. But,28
NA,"if it is defined as confectionery, as apparently",28
NA,"licorice is used in edible underwear, it has a",28
NA,10 per cent tax. If it is classed as a savoury,28
NA,snack it has a 10 per cent tax. If it is defined,28
NA,as food for birds-and that is something to,28
NA,think about-and if it is for birds which are,28
NA,"kept as domestic pets, it has a 20 per cent tax;",28
NA,but if it is for native birds there is no tax at,28
NA,all. So one can see that in the famous edible,28
NA,"underwear case, which is a true case, the sales",28
NA,tax office was thrown into a state of confu-,28
NA,sion.,28
NA,There are more serious cases. There is the,28
NA,famous example of these so-called health,28
NA,"bars, muesli bars and so on where the Tax",28
NA,"Office and the manufacturers, and ultimately",28
NA,"the wholesalers, have had to try to decide",28
NA,whether they are food or confectionery. But,28
NA,on top of those simple definitional problems,28
NA,"there are valuation problems. Generally, the",28
NA,sale value is the equivalent wholesale value,28
NA,of goods. But what if the goods are not in,28
NA,fact sold by a wholesaler? In that case one,28
NA,has an extraordinarily complex problem in,28
NA,trying to work out how one values the pro-,28
NA,duct which is taxed at the wholesale level,28
NA,where there is no apparent person who is the,28
NA,wholesaler.,28
NA,"There is the problem which, of course, we",28
NA,allude to continually about the failure to,28
NA,"exempt a wide range of business inputs,",28
NA,which creates further borderline problems. For,28
NA,"example, manufacturers get an exemption on",28
NA,fork-lift trucks if they are used in manufactur-,28
NA,"ing premises, but they pay tax if they are used",28
NA,in a storage area. Wholesalers and retailers,28
NA,who do not manufacture goods at all end up,28
NA,"not getting the exemption. Indeed, the failure",28
NA,to exempt business inputs gives rise to the,28
NA,worst aspects of the wholesale sales tax-its,28
NA,propensity to impose tax on top of tax over,28
NA,and over again.,28
NA,"Finally, just in terms of the cost of adminis-",28
NA,"tering the tax to business, the failure of the",28
NA,wholesale sales tax to keep pace with advan-,28
NA,ces in commercial practices and technology,28
NA,has led to an enormous amount of work,28
NA,having to be undertaken by the Tax Office,28
NA,itself in trying to rectify these anomalies and,28
NA,"in introducing administrative edicts and,",28
NA,"ultimately, in persuading the Government to",28
NA,introduce amendments to the law. For exam-,28
NA,"ple, in 1985-86 the Government decided that",28
NA,"it would tax computer software. By the way,",28
NA,this is part of the Australian Labor Party's,28
NA,endeavour to broaden the scope of the whole-,28
NA,sale sales tax system. So in that year it decid-,28
NA,"ed to tax computer software, only to find that",28
NA,the administration of that legislation was,28
NA,simply impossible to carry out and subse-,28
NA,quently it had to be repealed.,28
NA,There are examples like that which go on,28
NA,"and on and on-some trivial, some serious-",28
NA,"but the fact is that, in order to administer this",28
NA,"ramshackle, old-fashioned, totally out-of-date",28
NA,"and historic taxation system, it is costing",28
NA,business about $500m a year. But the impact,28
NA,"of this old tax, this grandfather of sales taxes,",28
NA,"of consumption taxes, on the direct sectors of",28
NA,the community is also absolutely exorbitant.,28
NA,"Of course, none of these costs to business-",28
NA,none of these sales taxes on their inputs-is,28
NA,"in any way rebatable, as they would be with",28
NA,a goods and services tax.,28
NA,"First of all, there is the cost to exporters.",28
NA,Exporters pay wholesale sales tax on many of,28
NA,"their inputs, even though the goods which are",28
NA,actually exported are supposed to be exempt.,28
NA,That adds something like $1.2 billion to,28
NA,"export prices, thereby making Australian",28
NA,exports relatively uncompetitive. This point,28
NA,was made in Helen Hughes's famous report,28
NA,on Australian export industries and the failure,28
NA,of the country to compete in export markets.,28
NA,One of the points that Professor Hughes made,28
NA,was that this country needed a goods and,28
NA,"services tax so that it could compete, at least",28
NA,"in taxation terms, on an equal footing with",28
NA,most other countries which have a sales tax,29
NA,system of that kind.,29
NA,The sales tax effect on the tourism industry,29
NA,"is also very great, and it is often unknown.",29
NA,"Let us take, for example, the effect of the",29
NA,wholesale sales tax on accommodation alone.,29
NA,"In the tourism industry, its cost is something",29
NA,like $66m a year. Travel agents pay the,29
NA,wholesale sales tax on all of their inputs-to,29
NA,suppliers of services and for entertainment,29
NA,"activities, transport and so on. They are all",29
NA,paying wholesale sales tax on their inputs.,29
NA,"Hire cars, taxis, trucks, refrigerated vans and",29
NA,"so on, all of which are extensively used in the",29
NA,"tourism industry, are all subject to the whole-",29
NA,sale sales tax-and none of it is rebatable. In,29
NA,"other words, it is a very real impost directly",29
NA,"on the business community, with no relief",29
NA,through a rebate system.,29
NA,"Telecom, arguably Australia's biggest",29
NA,"business, spent something like $375m last",29
NA,year in wholesale sales tax on its capital,29
NA,equipment purchases. Let us look at the road,29
NA,transport industry. The Road Transport Indus-,29
NA,"try Forum, in a recent article in a magazine",29
NA,"called Truckin' Life, estimated that something",29
NA,like $1 billion a year in sales tax was being,29
NA,paid by the transport industry-none of it,29
NA,rebatable; all of it adding to the costs of any,29
NA,goods which are carried by transport to any,29
NA,"part of Australia, and sometimes to the",29
NA,"wharves of this country, to get those products",29
NA,exported.,29
NA,People who live in regional and country,29
NA,Australia all have on them a greater sales tax,29
NA,impost because of their greater dependence on,29
NA,transport to get goods to them-none of it,29
NA,rebatable under the Government's system; all,29
NA,of it rebatable under the goods and services,29
NA,tax system. Think of those two or three very,29
NA,major national transport companies. They are,29
NA,spending around $lOm each in sales tax on,29
NA,"spare parts, tyres and new transport vehicles.",29
NA,"None of that is rebatable, as it would be with",29
NA,a goods and services tax.,29
NA,Let us look at the impact of the wholesale,29
NA,"sales tax on the motor vehicle industry, an",29
NA,industry which is totemic to Australia-it is,29
NA,regarded as the most symbolic of all of our,29
NA,manufacturing industries. It is a savage impost,29
NA,on that industry because the motor vehicle,29
NA,industry in this country alone bears 30 per,29
NA,cent of the burden of the wholesale sales tax.,29
NA,New car dealers also pay wholesale sales tax,29
NA,on most of their business inputs-that is on,29
NA,top of the 20 or 30 per cent sales tax that is,29
NA,"paid on the motor vehicles. For example, the",29
NA,car dealer-whether it is a new car dealer or,29
NA,"one who sells second-hand cars, and typically",29
NA,dealers will do both-pays sales tax on office,29
NA,furniture and furnishings; office equipment,29
NA,"such as computers, fax machines and photo-",29
NA,copiers; advertising brochures; price lists;,29
NA,"business cards; office, showroom and caryard",29
NA,lighting; serviCing equipment; equipment and,29
NA,tools used to carry out warranty repairs;,29
NA,demonstrator vehicles-and so the list goes,29
NA,"on. None of it is rebatable, remember; all of",29
NA,it is borne by the dealer himself or herself.,29
NA,Car manufacturers pay wholesale sales tax,29
NA,"on many of their inputs as well, even though",29
NA,"their products, once manufactured and whole-",29
NA,"saled, have to bear the wholesale sales tax on",29
NA,top of that. They pay wholesale sales tax on,29
NA,goods for general administration of the,29
NA,"company, computers, the sales representatives'",29
NA,"cars, advertising videos-on a whole list of",29
NA,things that car companies produce and need,29
NA,for efficient manufacture. They are slugged,29
NA,"with a wholesale sales tax and again, in",29
NA,contrast with the goods and services tax,29
NA,proposal that we on this side of the House put,29
NA,"forward, none of that tax is rebatable; all of",29
NA,it is fully borne by the industry and simply,29
NA,adds to the cost of the industry. That makes,29
NA,"it uncompetitive in the face of imports, and",29
NA,uncompetitive in the international market-,29
NA,place.,29
NA,I noticed-as other readers of the,29
NA,Australian Financial Review today will also,29
NA,have noticed-that some people have been,29
NA,talking about the potential costs to the racing,29
NA,industry of a goods and services tax. This is,29
NA,another of the great scare campaigns that the,29
NA,"Labor Party is rushing around mounting, as if",29
NA,there were no wholesale sales tax impact on,29
NA,the racing industry now; as if any impact,29
NA,"were rebatable, which it is not.",29
NA,The fact is that the racing industry-just to,29
NA,take that one admittedly rather emotive,29
NA,industry in this country-is subject to a,29
NA,wholesale sales tax burden of around $100m,29
NA,a year. None of this is rebatable. Admission,30
NA,tickets and course entry tokens are hit with a,30
NA,wholesale sales tax. The fertilisers which are,30
NA,used to keep the track in good order are hit,30
NA,with the wholesale sales tax. The hoses used,30
NA,to water the track are hit with a 20 per cent,30
NA,wholesale sales tax. The Minister for Science,30
NA,"and Technology ( Mr Free), who is at the",30
NA,"table, might recall that mobile barriers and",30
NA,motor vehicles used to tow the mobile barriers,30
NA,are subject to a sales tax of 20 per cent.,30
NA,Mr Tim Fischer-The cameras.,30
Mr DOWNER,"The lighting for the track,",30
NA,"the cameras, as the Leader of the National",30
NA,"Party of Australia points out, the electric",30
NA,"equipment used by the starter, air conditioning",30
NA,equipment and duct work in the enclosed,30
NA,"viewing areas, floor coverings, tables, chairs,",30
NA,"cutlery, food preparation and preservation",30
NA,"equipment, cash registers, food and drink",30
NA,vending machines and trophies attract a 20,30
NA,"per cent sales tax. Sashes, horse mgs, totalisa-",30
NA,"tor machines, totalisator display boards and",30
NA,television monitors are also subject to a 20,30
NA,per cent wholesale sales tax.,30
NA,I will not bore everybody by going through,30
NA,every single thing on a racetrack. When one,30
NA,goes to the races on a Saturday or a,30
NA,"Wednesday, as one does in Strathalbyn in my",30
NA,"electorate, all of those things are subject to a",30
NA,wholesale sales tax and none of them are,30
NA,reb-table. They are simply borne by the,30
NA,-acmg club; they are borne by the racing,30
NA,mdustry; they are borne ultimately by the,30
NA,"?o?Sumers. It is an impost, though, because",30
NA,It IS not rebatable. This simply makes busi-,30
NA,ness inefficient and uncompetitive.,30
NA,"Let me say in conclusion, Mr Deputy",30
NA,"Speaker, that the great difference between the",30
NA,iniquitous and irrational wholesales sales tax,30
NA,system-,30

Mr FREE ,Lindsay-Minister for Science,30
NA,and Technology and Minister Assisting the,30
NA,Treasurer) (3.27 p.m.)-Whatever else one,30
NA,can say about the contributions of the honour-,30
NA,"able mem-er for Mayo ( Mr Downer), they",30
NA,seldom fad to amuse. Rarely does one learn,30
NA,"very much by listening to him, but today we",30
NA,might in fact have learnt a little more about,30
NA,the continuing mystery and saga of the,30
NA,Opposition's consumption tax.,30
NA,The honourable member for Mayo was keen,30
NA,to tell us about the longevity of the wholesale,30
NA,sales tax. I would have thought that that was,30
NA,an excellent argument in favour of a tax,30
NA,which has clearly stood the test of time. We,30
NA,learnt of his great interest in edible underwear,30
NA,"and other items of entertainment. Regrettably,",30
NA,he did not treat us to quotes from Senator,30
NA,-anstone's . little red book. That was a great,30
NA,pIty. We mtght look forward to his doing that,30
NA,in the future. Towards the end of the speech,30
NA,I thought he was actually speaking about a,30
NA,life after politics operating 'a lift in a depart-,30
NA,ment store.,30
NA,The honourable member referred to the cost,30
NA,"of -e wholesale sales tax to exports, the",30
NA,"tounsm industry, telecommunications, road",30
NA,transport and the motor vehicle industry. He,30
NA,argued that these costs were not reba table,30
NA,under a wholesale sales tax system. Is he,30
NA,telling us a little more about the Opposition's,30
NA,consumption tax policy? Is he telling us that,30
NA,goods and services in categories related to,30
NA,those areas are likely to be exempt from a,30
NA,GST?,30
NA,"Mr Downer-No, they are not rebatable'",30
NA,you don't understand the words. ',30
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,30
NA,member will remain silent.,30
Mr FREE,We need to know a lot more,30
NA,about the Opposition's policy than the,30
NA,Australian people have been told to date.,30
NA,Let me put the question of wholesale sales,30
NA,tax into the context of Labor's proud record,30
NA,in taxation reform. I remind the House that,30
NA,when this party won office in 1983 it inherit-,30
NA,ed a taxation system which was in disrepair,30
NA,and disrepute. Years of neglect had resulted,30
NA,"in a system which was inequitable, inefficient",31
NA,and complex. The previous coalition,31
NA,"Government, led by Mr Fraser and guided by",31
NA,the economic adviser who is currently the,31
NA,"Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson),",31
NA,simply ignored the basic principles of taxation,31
NA,"policy-that is, equity, efficiency and sim-",31
NA,plicity.,31
NA,Since 1983 the Labor Party has developed,31
NA,"a taxation system which is fairer, more effi-",31
NA,cient and no longer open to massive abuse.,31
NA,Let me remind the House of some of these,31
NA,reforms. The top personal marginal taxation,31
NA,"rate is now 47 per cent; in 1983, it was 60",31
NA,per cent. The bottom personal marginal tax,31
NA,"rate is now 21 per cent; in 1983, it was 30",31
NA,per cent. The company tax rate is now 39 per,31
NA,"cent; in 1983, it was 46 per cent. The effec-",31
NA,tive rate of company taxation in 1983 was an,31
NA,astonishing 78.4 per cent. So much for an,31
NA,"Opposition which, when in government,",31
NA,imposed these kinds of burdens on business.,31
NA,The introduction of the capital gains tax by,31
NA,this Government has meant that the privi-,31
NA,"leged, who take a proportion of their income",31
NA,"in capital gains, are now taxed. Before 1983",31
NA,taxation was an optional extra for the well-,31
NA,"heeled. Fringe benefits are now taxed, and",31
NA,this raised over $1.26 billion in 1990-91.,31
NA,"Under previous conservative governments, tax",31
NA,"free fringe benefits were substituted, of",31
NA,"course, for cash income. The reforms institut-",31
NA,ed by this Government have ensured fairness,31
NA,in the taxation system. People are now paying,31
NA,their share.,31
NA,Entertainment expenses are no longer,31
NA,"recognised as a tax deduction. As a Party, we",31
NA,abolished the long free lunch previously,31
NA,enjoyed at the expense of the average,31
NA,"Australian. By introducing franked dividends,",31
NA,Labor has reduced the effective company tax,31
NA,rate. It has meant that income received from,31
NA,equity investments is no longer double taxed,31
NA,and a longstanding bias against equity invest-,31
NA,ment in favour of debt financing has been,31
NA,"corrected-again by Labor. In addition, Labor",31
NA,has ensured that foreign income is properly,31
NA,taxed. The reforms of the Hawke Government,31
NA,have meant that elaborate company structures,31
NA,established in offshore tax havens cannot be,31
NA,"used to disguise foreign income. In addition,",31
NA,the Australian community now receives an,31
NA,appropriate return from the use of its natural,31
NA,resources through the resource rent tax.,31
NA,The wholesale sales tax system has been,31
NA,changed over those years. The honourable,31
NA,member for Mayo would have one believe,31
NA,that the wholesale sales tax system has been,31
NA,"immutable and not subject to change. This, of",31
NA,"course, has not been so. It has been altered",31
NA,over the years to reduce compliance costs. As,31
NA,a result of reforms introduced by this,31
NA,"Government, wholesale sales tax collections,",31
NA,"as a proportion of total taxation revenue, have",31
NA,increased at the rate of only 1.2 per cent since,31
NA,"1983-84. Further, as a result of Labor's tax",31
NA,"reforms, the amount of tax paid by individuals",31
NA,as a proportion of total taxation revenue has,31
NA,declined. So much for the alleged burden on,31
NA,business of the wholesale sales tax.,31
NA,"As I indicated earlier, the longevity of the",31
NA,wholesale sales tax is an indication that it has,31
NA,stood the test of time. Let me deal briefly,31
NA,with some of those reforms to which I re-,31
NA,ferred earlier. Reforms of the wholesale sales,31
NA,tax have been directed to improving the,31
NA,efficiency and fairness of the system. I point,31
NA,to changes over the years that have done,31
NA,"exactly that; for example, measures introduced",31
NA,in May 1985 to reduce evasion and avoid-,31
NA,"ance, saving the taxpayer $400m. There were",31
NA,changes introduced in September 1985 to rate,31
NA,classes and applied to base broadening and,31
NA,correction of anomalies and inconsistencies.,31
NA,Further base broadening and correction of,31
NA,anomalies and introduction of changes in,31
NA,sales tax rates on wfue were introduced in,31
NA,"1986-87. In 1987-88, the sales tax exemption",31
NA,for commercial government authorities was,31
NA,"removed, a move designed to put these",31
NA,authorities on an equal footing with private,31
NA,sector firms competing for the same re-,31
NA,"sources. In 1988-89, the sales tax exemption",31
NA,was removed from beer. Further adjustments,31
NA,"were made in 1990-91, including the exten-",31
NA,sion of exemptions for computer software and,31
NA,a move to provide for quarterly payments for,31
NA,small businesses. All through its period of,31
NA,"government, the Government has quite sensib-",31
NA,ly looked at the wholesale sales tax system,31
NA,and made those adjustments where it has been,31
NA,thought necessary and desirable.,31
NA,I make the point that the wholesale sales,32
NA,tax system is an established one. It is one that,32
NA,is well understood; it is one that does not,32
NA,impose on business the burden that the Oppo-,32
NA,sition would have the House believe.,32
NA,"In addition, during this debate something",32
NA,has been made of the impact of varying rates,32
NA,of wholesale sales tax on different goods. Far,32
NA,from this being the confusing aspect of the,32
NA,"tax that the Opposition would have us believe,",32
NA,this very often gives government the oppor-,32
NA,tunity to use the wholesale sales tax to discri-,32
NA,minate in various ways either in favour of,32
NA,groups in the community or in favour of,32
NA,particular products. I give two examples. One,32
NA,of the measures introduced as a result of this,32
NA,year's Budget is the provision of assistance to,32
NA,disabled people in purchasing motor vehicles,32
NA,and equipment associated with the transport,32
NA,"of disabled people. As a result, wholesale",32
NA,sales tax has been reduced in that area. A,32
NA,specific measure has been applied to assist,32
NA,disabled people. This is the kind of positive,32
NA,discrimination that would simply not be,32
NA,available under a consumption tax regime.,32
NA,Before that the Government took a deci-,32
NA,sion-a decision I think supported by the vast,32
NA,"majority of the Australian community and, I",32
NA,"hope, by a majority of the Opposition-that",32
NA,it would be in our national interest to promote,32
NA,"the use of recycled products and, in particular,",32
NA,"recycled paper. As a result, the Government",32
NA,decided to remove sales tax on recycled,32
NA,paper-a move which I hoped had the support,32
NA,"of the Opposition, but perhaps not the honour-",32
NA,able member for Mayo. This is again I think,32
NA,an instance where-,32
NA,Mr Downer-Have you read the Industry,32
NA,Commission report?,32
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,The honourable,32
NA,member for Mayo will remain silent. He was,32
NA,heard in silence and he will remain silent or,32
NA,I will warn him.,32
Mr FREE,This is again an instance in,32
NA,which the Government can use the wholesale,32
NA,sales tax system to work towards desirable,32
NA,outcomes in areas of general policy.,32
NA,I now ask this question: if the Opposition,32
NA,"wants to remove the wholesale sales tax, what",32
NA,will it replace it with? Those opposite tell us,32
NA,that we will have a goods and services tax-a,32
NA,"GST, a consumption tax. They have not been",32
NA,terribly good at providing the details of,32
NA,exactly what shape this consumption tax will,32
NA,"take, the rates at which it will be applied, and",32
NA,what kinds of attempts might be made to,32
NA,provide compensation. We are told that we,32
NA,will get details at some stage in the future. I,32
NA,know that many members of the press gallery,32
NA,and certainly many people interested in the,32
NA,shape of politics in this country were ap-,32
NA,proaching 25 September with bated breath;,32
NA,the Leader of the Opposition had booked the,32
NA,National Press Club for that day and excite-,32
NA,ment rose. But unfortunately Dr Hewson,32
NA,"squibbed it on that day. Yet again, we have",32
NA,to wait for the details of the consumption tax.,32
NA,I repeat what my Leader and other,32
NA,government members have said: a consump-,32
NA,tion tax is simply not on Labor's agenda. We,32
NA,reject it because of the simple fact that a,32
NA,consumption tax represents an attack on,32
NA,"individual Australians. Further, it would",32
NA,increase inflation. A major objective of our,32
NA,economic policy is to see further reductions,32
NA,"in inflation. By doing so, the Government",32
NA,establishes the basis of sustainable increases,32
NA,"in employment. In addition, a permanent",32
NA,reduction in inflation means sustainable wages,32
NA,"outcomes, resulting in an automatic advance-",32
NA,ment in welfare for those on fixed incomes,32
NA,and then further reductions in interest rates.,32
NA,This is a major objective of current economic,32
NA,policy.,32
NA,What effect would a consumption tax have,32
NA,on inflation? What effect would a consump-,32
NA,tion tax have on those employment outcomes,32
NA,which I hoped were an objective shared by,32
NA,the Opposition and the Government? Let me,32
NA,give honourable members the evidence from,32
NA,Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers,32
NA,Association. He argues that a 15 per cent,32
NA,consumption tax would result in an immediate,32
NA,15 per cent increase in inflation. This is borne,32
NA,"out by what happened in New Zealand, where",32
NA,inflation shot to a massive 18.9 per cent after,32
NA,the introduction of a consumption tax at 10,32
NA,"per cent. Only now in New Zealand, after",32
NA,"four years of recession, has inflation come",32
NA,down. Imagine what the results would be if a,32
NA,consumption tax at the rate of 15 per cent,33
NA,were to be introduced in this country.,33
NA,Let us look at the general effect of a con-,33
NA,sumption tax should it be introduced. The,33
NA,Australian Catholic Social Welfare,33
NA,Commission summed it up rather well in June,33
NA,this year when it said that shifting from,33
NA,income tax to a goods and services tax would,33
NA,increase tax burdens for low income earners,33
NA,"and families, both urban and rural. A con-",33
NA,sumption tax is clearly regressive. The people,33
NA,it hits hardest are those on the lowest in-,33
NA,comes. A consumption tax would also mean,33
NA,that Australia would forgo jobs and forgo,33
NA,growth.,33
NA,Let us have a look at the impact of a,33
NA,"consumption tax on business, the sector",33
NA,currently allegedly suffering such a burden.,33
NA,My colleague the Minister for Small Business,33
NA,and Customs ( Mr Beddall) told me that there,33
NA,"are 930,000 reasons for rejecting a consump-",33
NA,tion tax. The introduction of a consumption,33
NA,tax would provide for approximately one,33
NA,million collection points. There are currently,33
NA,"70,000 collection points for the wholesale",33
NA,"sales tax. In other words, it would provide for",33
NA,the increase in collection points for tax of,33
NA,"930,000 in this country-hence the 930,000",33
NA,reasons for rejecting the Opposition's con-,33
NA,sumption tax.,33
NA,Small businesses would be forced to ac-,33
NA,count in detail to the Australian Taxation,33
NA,Office for every item purchased and for every,33
NA,transaction made in order to claim rebates on,33
NA,the consumption tax. It would mean that,33
NA,every small business would have to institute,33
NA,new accounting and cash flow procedures.,33
NA,Every small business in Australia would be,33
NA,collecting tax and would be monitoring the,33
NA,activities of its business neighbOurs. The cost,33
NA,of complying with a consumption tax would,33
NA,fall most heavily on small business. The,33
NA,British experience shows that for every $100,33
NA,"earned, just in complying with the task of",33
NA,administering a value added tax $1.20 is paid,33
NA,out by those in small business.,33
NA,"In summary, a consumption tax means",33
NA,reduced profitability and increasedadministra-,33
NA,tive burdens for business overall. It is unfortuwith,33
NA,"nate that I am running out of time, as I cannot",33
NA,refer in detail to the likely impact of a con-,33
NA,"sumption tax on the racing industry, a subject",33
NA,which apparently interests the honourable,33
NA,member for Mayo. (Time expired),33
Mrs BAILEY ,MCEwen) (3.42 p.m.)-I do,33
NA,not believe that there has ever been such,33
NA,widespread and unified condemnation of the,33
NA,wholesale sales tax system. The Minister for,33
NA,Science and Technology ( Mr Free) is indeed,33
NA,a rare species in supporting a system of,33
NA,wholesale sales tax that is so iniquitous. The,33
NA,"words 'equity', 'simplicity' and 'efficiency'",33
NA,that the Minister used in his speech certainly,33
NA,do not apply to the wholesale sales tax,33
NA,"system. In fact, most of what the Minister",33
NA,said did not apply to the wholesale sales tax,33
NA,system or the problems that the honourable,33
NA,member for Mayo ( Mr Downer) raised.,33
NA,We are in the worst economic condition,33
NA,since the 1930s. We have a country riddled,33
NA,with high levels of debt and with unemploy-,33
NA,ment officially hovering around the one,33
NA,million mark. Business bankruptcies increased,33
NA,over 50 per cent compared with the same,33
NA,period last year. The Confederation of,33
NA,Australian Industry's survey of investor,33
NA,confidence showed continuing high levels of,33
NA,"business pessimism. In faCt, 87.5 per cent of",33
NA,the respondents surveyed described the,33
NA,"climate for investment as poor, very poor or",33
NA,"deeply depressed. Make no mistake, it is the",33
NA,deliberate policies of this 60vernment that are,33
NA,directly responsible for the very sick state of,33
NA,our economy.,33
NA,The tragedy is that those on the,33
NA,Government benches have had the opportuni-,33
NA,"ties for reform, but they have frittered them",33
NA,away. Never has there been a more critical,33
NA,time for this Government to reform our,33
NA,wholesale sales tax system and provide some,33
NA,"much needed relief to business, to remove the",33
NA,heavy imposts of tax on business so that,33
NA,growth can be stimulated and so that employ-,33
NA,ment opportunities can be provided. But this,33
NA,Government lacks the resolve. We have said,33
NA,in this debate today that the wholesale sales,33
NA,"tax system is outdated, unfair and ramshackle.",33
NA,"The list of business, industry, manufacturing,",33
NA,mining and farming organisations that agree,33
NA,this statement is growing at a daily rate.,33
NA,The honourable member for Blaxland was,33
NA,"absolutely correct when on 13 June 1985,",33
NA,while speaking to the Sydney Morning Her-,34
NA,"ald, he said:",34
NA,The existing wholesale sales tax is fraught with,34
NA,anomalies and complexities which render adminis-,34
NA,tration and compliance unduly burdensome.,34
NA,Among its other features Which make it an undesir-,34
NA,"able tax are: its multiple rates and exemptions,",34
NA,which distort both demand and supply decisions;,34
NA,valuation difficulties in determining a wholesale,34
NA,price in a world of widely varying distribution,34
NA,arrangements; the fact that the tax must be carried,34
NA,"by retailers when goods sit in stock, with retail",34
NA,margins applied to the tax-inclusive wholesale,34
NA,"price; a high proportion of the tax, about a half, is",34
NA,taxed on industry inputs.,34
NA,These features represented enormous cost to,34
NA,business in 1985. As the former Treasurer,34
NA,widened the wholesale sales tax base to,34
NA,collect more indirect tax to compensate for his,34
NA,"lost opportunity for reform, today they repre-",34
NA,sent even greater cost to business.,34
NA,"Professor Cnossen, in the Australian Tax",34
NA,"Forum Journal, agreed that more than half of",34
NA,the initial incidence of wholesale sales tax is,34
NA,imposed on business inputs. A study prepared,34
NA,for the Business Council of Australia by,34
NA,Monash University in March 1991 also,34
NA,"agreed, and it estimated that 49 per cent of",34
NA,the initial incidence of wholesale sales tax is,34
NA,on business purchases of inputs not eligible,34
NA,for exemption as aids to manufacture. A,34
NA,further 14 per cent of wholesale sales tax,34
NA,initially falls on business purchases of invest-,34
NA,ment goods.,34
NA,It is the very nature of the wholesale sales,34
NA,"tax system that makes it unfair, outdated and",34
NA,such a huge cost to business. It is the cpm-,34
NA,"plexity of the system-with multiple rates,",34
NA,"exemptions, anomalies and compliance",34
NA,costs-that is of such enormous cost to,34
NA,"business. Multiple rates of 10 per cent, 20 per",34
NA,cent and 30 per cent are applied to different,34
NA,"categories of goods, unless those goods are",34
NA,exempt. The rationale used for applying,34
NA,different rates to different categories of items,34
NA,"is arbitrary, but the onus of compliance falls",34
NA,on the business taxpayer. It is these mUltiple,34
NA,rates and exemptions that lead to costly,34
NA,disputes with the Australian Taxation Office.,34
NA,Even if a business wins a decision against,34
NA,"the Tax Office, the Tax Office can appeal to",34
NA,"a higher court. While that appeal is pending,",34
NA,the Tax Office insists that tax is payable in,34
NA,accordance with its interpretation of the law,34
NA,until the dispute finally is resolved by a,34
NA,higher court. This places the business in,34
NA,question in an invidious position. If that,34
NA,"business acts on the lower court decision,",34
NA,should that decision ultimately be over-,34
NA,turned-often years later-the business,34
NA,taxpayer is unable to recover the tax from,34
NA,customers and so must bear the cost from his,34
NA,"or her own resources. On the other hand,",34
NA,should a business charge and return tax to the,34
NA,Tax Office on the basis of the Tax Office's,34
NA,"advice, that business may not be able to",34
NA,recover that tax if it becomes overpaid tax on,34
NA,a later decision. It is because of the day-to-,34
NA,day nature of the wholesale sales tax system,34
NA,that businesses are often inhibited .from,34
NA,exercising their objections and rights of,34
NA,appeal. Often it is another cost on top of the,34
NA,already high cost of administering the system,34
NA,that business simply cannot afford.,34
NA,Let me give some concrete examples of,34
NA,some of these day-to-day problems that,34
NA,businesses face in dealing with this outdated,34
NA,"system. On the one hand the Prime Minister,",34
NA,"in his 12 March industry statement, exhorted",34
NA,business to export more manufactured goods,34
NA,and services and to substitute more quality,34
NA,Australian production for imports. No-one,34
NA,would disagree with that sentiment. But on,34
NA,"the other hand, by maintaining the wholesale",34
NA,"sales tax system, the Prime Minister is mak-",34
NA,ing our export industries uncompetitive to the,34
NA,tune of over $1 billion per year because of,34
NA,business input costs. But it is even worse than,34
NA,that. The whole question of whether or not,34
NA,particular processes applied to goods consti-,34
NA,tute manufacture for wholesale sales tax,34
NA,purposes is central to the whole meaning of,34
NA,"the system. But, in spite of this crucial im-",34
NA,"portance, the actual definitions of",34
NA,'manufacture' and 'manufacturer' have been,34
NA,the subject of numerous legal challenges.,34
NA,"For example, the reassembling of motor-",34
NA,"cycles which previously ha""d--been assembled",34
NA,and tested by an overseas supplier and then,34
NA,knocked down into parts for shipping to,34
NA,Australia was not defined as manufacture; yet,34
NA,the assembling for the first time in Australia,34
NA,of a motorcycle or car from completely,34
NA,knocked-down parts was defined as manufac-,35
NA,"ture. The making up by a florist of wreaths,",35
NA,"bouquets, posies, floral baskets and sheaves",35
NA,of flowers constitutes manufacture; yet the,35
NA,assembling of a bunch of flowers does not.,35
NA,The whole wholesale sales tax system is not,35
NA,only a huge cost to business but also a night-,35
NA,mare for business to administer. Imagine,35
NA,being in the position of a business involved,35
NA,in the building industry. Building materials,35
NA,"may be unconditionally exempt, conditionally",35
NA,"exempt, taxable at 10 per cent or taxable at",35
NA,20 per cent. Often the point of distinction is,35
NA,"clouded, to say the least. Roller doors which",35
NA,incorporate a built-in motor qualify for ex-,35
NA,emption as builders' hardware; but if the,35
NA,"motor is external to the roller door, the motor",35
NA,is subject to tax.,35
NA,The question of classification of wardrobes,35
NA,"and so-called built-in cupboards, such as",35
NA,"broom cupboards, over many years frequently",35
NA,has been subject to different interpretations by,35
NA,the Australian Taxation Office and the trade,35
NA,"in different States. At one stage, for example,",35
NA,tests such as the provision of screws to build,35
NA,in a wardrobe or the absence of a back have,35
NA,been used to differentiate exempt built-in,35
NA,joinery from taxable freestanding furniture.,35
NA,Retail businesses experience cash flow,35
NA,difficulties. The Government's own Beddall,35
NA,report recognised these huge costs. Of the 23,35
NA,"recommendations dealing with tax reform, the",35
NA,recommendation to have further discussions,35
NA,with the Treasurer seems to be the rule of,35
NA,thumb. The meaning of exactly what is,35
NA,"manufacture, conditional exemptioIL<;, compli-",35
NA,"ance costs, anomalies, cash flow problems and",35
NA,the added costs that make our efforts uncom-,35
NA,petitive all add up to these huge costs of this,35
NA,unfair system. (lime expired),35
Ms CRAWFORD ,Forde) (3.52 p.m.)-I,35
NA,rise to oppose the matter which the honour-,35
NA,able member for Mayo ( Mr Downer) has,35
NA,raised. I look at it in terms of the way in,35
NA,which I find people talking about equity. To,35
NA,talk of equity in relation to the Opposition's,35
NA,proposal to change the wholesale tax system,35
NA,to a consumption tax is extraordinary; mem-,35
NA,bers of the Opposition are the very group of,35
NA,people who are pursuing inequity in a system,35
NA,that they propose as a substitute for the,35
NA,wholesale sales tax system.,35
NA,The wholesale sales tax system enables us,35
NA,"as a Government to target areas, and the",35
NA,Government has responded to the Beddall,35
NA,report and to those demands of small business,35
NA,by announcing in the 1990-91 Budget the,35
NA,review that was undertaken by the Australian,35
NA,"Taxation Office, the Treasury, industry repre-",35
NA,sentatives and other professional bodies. The,35
NA,Government looked at the range of issues,35
NA,within the wholesale sales tax area. That area,35
NA,is efficient in that it allows targeting. We,35
NA,have heard that already from the Minister for,35
NA,"Science and Technology ( Mr Free), who is at",35
NA,the table. He showed the way in which the,35
NA,Government can show its compassion in this,35
NA,area by addressing issues concerning those,35
NA,people with disabilities. It can also respond to,35
NA,the needs and demands of business in the way,35
NA,"that it has by dealing with recycled paper,",35
NA,software and other issues.,35
NA,"The Government has attempted, and pur-",35
NA,"sued, a streamlining of the wholesale sales tax",35
NA,system. But honourable members on the other,35
NA,"side, while they talk about a range of figures",35
NA,"within a wholesale sales tax system, have",35
NA,failed to look at the one figure which many,35
NA,"Australians know and recognise-that is, zero.",35
NA,On many of our services and on necessities of,35
NA,life we pay no sales tax at all. What the,35
NA,Opposition members are endeavouring to,35
NA,"change is that zero, which would become",35
NA,something in the region of 15 per cent to 20,35
NA,per cent.,35
NA,We find that the kinds of concerns for the,35
NA,tourism industry about which the Opposition,35
NA,bleat are not shared by the Opposition's own,35
NA,partners in the Northern Territory. They have,35
NA,placed a consumption tax and a levy on,35
NA,tourism beds-an attempt to gain more tour-,35
NA,ists by putting up more fees which has,35
NA,"brought about a reverse effect. Indeed, we",35
NA,need only look at that to know that is the,35
NA,kind of direction in which members of the,35
NA,"Opposition are leading us, and that the kinds",35
NA,of arguments which we have heard trotted out,35
NA,against the wholesale sales tax are in fact,35
NA,quite spurious. We heard the sleazy story,35
NA,from the honourable member for Mayo about,35
NA,underwear. I listened to that part of his speech,35
NA,with disgust. His behaviour can only be,36
NA,described as outrageous.,36
NA,The other tenn which is bandied around by,36
NA,members of the Opposition is a 'rebatable',36
NA,consumption tax. Either we pay consumption,36
NA,tax or we do not. What sort of nonsense do,36
NA,we have here? We have an Opposition which,36
NA,"is proposing a change in tax policy, a shift in",36
NA,"tax policy, but then says, 'Don't worry folks,",36
NA,none of you will have to pay it; it is all,36
NA,rebatable'. We understand that very well,36
NA,because that is what the Opposition's tax,36
NA,"policy was right through the 1950s, 1960s and",36
NA,1970s when paying tax was simply an option,36
NA,"for the rich-not, I might add, for the poor.",36
NA,"Indeed, the capital gains tax, the fringe",36
NA,benefits tax and the tax file number are all,36
NA,measures of tax refonn which have been,36
NA,vigorously opposed by the Opposition. Why?,36
NA,Because everybody would have to pay them.,36
NA,Now we are presented with some grand,36
NA,"scheme of things which says, 'We will all",36
NA,pay'. Those of us who lived through the years,36
NA,of those opposite know that is never the case.,36
NA,"We do not all pay. We on this side, who are",36
NA,"poorer and less well off, will all pay; we",36
NA,know that very well. The richer and the well-,36
NA,"heeled, of course, do not pay and will never",36
NA,pay under the system which the Opposition,36
NA,has proposed. So I find it very interesting,36
NA,now to hear the honourable member for Mayo,36
NA,"talking about rateable allowances, and con-",36
NA,sumption tax which is rebatable. Good heav-,36
NA,"ens, what new jargon is this? What indeed is",36
NA,this goingAo do? What is it about? We also,36
NA,hear the consumption tax touted as the way in,36
NA,"which the black economy will be covered,",36
NA,those dreadful people out there who are,36
NA,operating in an economy in which they do not,36
NA,pay tax.,36
NA,Mr Free-That also applies to SP book-,36
NA,makers.,36
Ms CRAWFORD,"Indeed, SP bookmak-",36
NA,"ers, as the Minister says. But there are very",36
NA,many people who will argue that in fact the,36
NA,consumption tax is just what the doctor,36
NA,ordered for those people wishing to evade tax,36
NA,and join the market economy. There will be,36
NA,those of us who perhaps have a tradesperson,36
NA,come to our house who suggests a price for,36
NA,"some work to be done and then says, 'But, of",36
NA,"course, if you pay me in cash and none of us",36
NA,"do anything, then neither of us need pay the",36
NA,consumption tax or the income tax'. That is,36
NA,exactly what is going to happen. There are,36
NA,very many tax consultants who see the growth,36
NA,"of the black economy, the growth of the black",36
NA,"market, as playing a very real part in the way",36
NA,in which the consumption tax will affect our,36
NA,economy.,36
NA,The other matter which we have heard,36
NA,being bleated about today is the way in which,36
NA,"the wholesale sales tax affects business, and",36
NA,"small business in particular, but this new and",36
NA,grand scheme will be a panacea for all in,36
NA,business. Those people who have not had the,36
NA,opportunity to travel to Canada or England,36
NA,"will be unaware of the vast teams of people,",36
NA,"hundreds of thousands of people, who scour",36
NA,the countryside day and night in their role of,36
NA,"tax inspectors and value added tax collectors,",36
NA,and of the range of jokes about them. The,36
NA,"paperwork, the administration, has been",36
NA,absolutely mammoth.,36
NA,We heard the Minister for Science and,36
NA,Technology say that not only will we have,36
NA,"930,000 extra people filling in forms-even",36
NA,if they only have to fill in one extra fonn-,36
NA,but also the administrative charges and the,36
NA,time spent by small business on this will be,36
NA,simply outrageous. Small business now does,36
NA,not pay and has never paid tax on its ser-,36
NA,"vices-for example, its heating and its light-",36
NA,ing.,36
NA,Mr Downer-What about lights? There is,36
NA,a 20 per cent tax on lights.,36
Ms CRAWFORD,It does not pay tax on,36
NA,"electricity, or on the service for the lighting ---",36
NA,We know that this will come about. Once,36
NA,"again, the concern for small business is",36
NA,simply a shield to hide the Opposition's,36
NA,"friends, the big business world, because we",36
NA,"know, as does Australian society in general,",36
NA,the consumption tax will fall heaviest on,36
NA,people with low incomes and also on the,36
NA,smallest businesses. Those businesses who,36
NA,have fewer customers and employees and,36
NA,lower turnover will spend a disproportionate,36
NA,amount of their time and the time of their,36
NA,"staff filling out fonns, collecting the material",36
NA,and sending it in.,36
NA,"In Britain, the experience has been that, for",37
NA,"every $100 earned, $1.20 is paid by small",37
NA,business just to comply with the administra-,37
NA,tion of the VAT. The VAT in Britain is a tax,37
NA,"which has a huge number of exemptions, not",37
NA,"a tax, as is proposed here for small busines-",37
NA,"ses, which has no exemptions. Both the",37
NA,Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and,37
NA,"the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member",37
NA,for Flinders ( Mr Reith) have been at pains to,37
NA,"suggest that there is to be no exemption, so",37
NA,that we can have a nice simple method of,37
NA,operation.,37
NA,We on this side of the House are anxious to,37
NA,"see a tax system, a tax reform package, which",37
NA,"ensures that all Australians, be they individu-",37
NA,"als or people in business, are paying fairly",37
NA,"and equitably, contributing to the community.",37
NA,The system should be fair-and it is fair. It is,37
NA,"constantly being overhauled, as the wholesale",37
NA,sales tax system is. It has stood the test of,37
NA,"time, as indeed a consumption tax would not.",37
NA,We on this side of the House reject such,37
NA,nonsense. We believe this system would be,37
NA,absolutely iniquitous on small business in,37
NA,"Australia, on Australians in general and on",37
NA,society. We know that Australians everywhere,37
NA,will reject such an iniquitous and blatant tax,37
NA,that will in fact favour the rich and yet again,37
NA,penalise those people who are less well off in,37
NA,our community.,37
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. M.J.R.,37

NA,Second Reading,37
NA,"Debate resumed from 12 September, on",37
NA,motion by Mr Free:,37
NA,That the Bill be now read a second time.,37
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. M.J.R.,37
NA,MACKelIar)-I understand it is the wish of,37
NA,the House to debate the Export Finance and,37
NA,Insurance Corporation Bill 1991 concurrently,37
NA,with the Export Finance and Insurance,37
NA,Corporation (Transitional Provisions and,37
NA,Consequential Amendments) Bill 1991. There,37
NA,"being no objection, the chair will allow that",37
NA,course to be followed.,37
Mr DOWNER ,Mayo) (4.03 p.m.)-The,37
NA,coalition supports these Bills which the,37
NA,Government has introduced to make some,37
NA,changes to the way that the Export Finance,37
NA,and Insurance Corporation works. The chan-,37
NA,"ges are twofold. Firstly, the Export Finance",37
NA,and Insurance Corporation Bill hives off the,37
NA,Export Finance and Insurance Corporation,37
NA,from Austrade and establishes it as a,37
NA,"government business enterprise and, secondly,",37
NA,it provides for a $200m supplement to EFIC's,37
NA,reserves in the form of a callable capital,37
NA,"facility. The second Bill, the Export Finance",37
NA,and Insurance Corporation (Transitional,37
NA,Provisions and Consequential Amendments),37
NA,"Bill, is a transitional arrangement to ensure",37
NA,that EFIC can continue to operate during the,37
NA,period of transition.,37
NA,"In supporting this Bill, though, we on this",37
NA,side of the House would like to raise several,37
NA,issues in relation to EFIC and the way that,37
NA,"EFIC operates, and we would hope that the",37
NA,"Government and EFIC, in particular, will take",37
NA,1991. up some of these points because I think no,37
NA,"organisation is perfect and, in the case of",37
NA,"EFIC, there are certainly areas where examin-",37
NA,ation could be made into possible improve-,37
NA,ments and better liaison with the banking,37
NA,sector of the business community in particu-,37
NA,lar.,37
NA,There is one aspect of this Bill which we,37
NA,"would take issue with; that is, the decision by",37
NA,the Government to retain the ministerial,37
NA,responsibility for EFIC with the Minister for,37
NA,"Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator",37
NA,Button) rather than to transfer it to the Minis-,37
NA,ters responsible for the Department of Foreign,37
NA,Affairs and Trade. I think that the,38
NA,Government has been correct to transfer,38
NA,Austrade to the Department of Foreign Affairs,38
NA,"and Trade. I hope that, under the ministerial",38
NA,responsibility of the Minister for Trade and,38
NA,Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) or the,38
NA,Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Sena-,38
NA,tor Gareth Evans)-whoever is going to have,38
NA,the day to day responsibility for Austrade-,38
NA,that organisation will take the opportunity to,38
NA,become substantially more efficient and,38
NA,responsible than it has been in years gone by.,38
NA,It is also noteworthy that the Department of,38
NA,Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for,38
NA,"the operation of ADAB, the Australian Devel-",38
NA,"opment Assistance Bureau, which has carriage",38
NA,of the development import financing facility,38
NA,which interlinks with the work that EFIC,38
NA,"does. By definition, the Department of For-",38
NA,eign Affairs and Trade has responsibility for,38
NA,trade policy matters. I would have thought all,38
NA,would agree that EFIC's work indisputably,38
NA,was trade work.,38
NA,I think there is almost irrefutable logic for,38
NA,EPIC to be transferred to the Ministers re-,38
NA,sponsible for the Department of Foreign,38
NA,Affairs and rrade. I am disappointed that the,38
NA,Government has decided to leave EPIC with,38
NA,"Senator Button, which is effectively what the",38
NA,decision amounts to. His period of administer-,38
NA,"ing Austrade-EPIC, as it is until this legisla-",38
NA,"tion is enacted, has proved to be casual, to",38
NA,say the least.,38
NA,He clearly has not shown a great deal of,38
NA,interest in the operation of those organisations,38
NA,"or, one could say, that organisation. It is",38
NA,noteworthy that on only one occasion Senator,38
NA,"Button, as the Minister responsible for",38
NA,"Austrade-EPIC, had a formal meeting with the",38
NA,"former managing director of that organisation,",38
NA,Mr Lindsay MACAlister. I do not wish to,38
NA,speculate on what the nature of that meeting,38
NA,"was, except to say that it was very close to",38
NA,the end of Mr MACAlister's term as managing,38
NA,director of Austrade-EFIC.,38
NA,There is no doubt that the functions of,38
NA,EFIC are of some considerable help to,38
NA,Australian exp01ters. It is no coincidence that,38
NA,something like 10 per cent of all Australian,38
NA,exports are insured or at least dealt with in,38
NA,one form or another by EPIC. Given that it,38
NA,has the coverage for something like 10 per,38
NA,"cent of our exports, we can conclude from",38
NA,that that EPIC in principle has a very import-,38
NA,ant role to play in contributing towards the,38
NA,competitiveness of the Australian economy in,38
NA,the international marketplace.,38
NA,"Basically, EPIC has three functions. Firstly,",38
NA,it insures against the risk of non-payment by,38
NA,overseas buyers. That certainly was its tradi-,38
NA,tional and original role when it was estab-,38
NA,"lished back in the 1950s. Secondly, it insures",38
NA,offshore investments against non-conunercial,38
NA,"losses such as war damage and so on. Thirdly,",38
NA,it provides concessional finance for exports of,38
NA,capital goods. In providing those three func-,38
NA,"tions, I do not think it is really in contention",38
NA,that EFIC's assistance does constitute direct,38
NA,assistance to exporters. If one takes the,38
NA,"general insurance that EFIC undertakes, it is",38
NA,in many instances insurance that would not,38
NA,naturally be attractive to the commercial,38
NA,"market. If it were attractive to that market, it",38
NA,would be undertaken at a very considerable,38
NA,"cost, at a very high premium, to Australian",38
NA,exporters. That is not to say that EPIC con-,38
NA,ducts that insurance business at a loss; it does,38
NA,"not. The fact is that, with the benefit of being",38
NA,able to borrow in the marketplace with a,38
NA,"government guarantee, it is therefore able to",38
NA,conduct that business at a lower cost than,38
NA,might be the case by the general business,38
NA,sector.,38
NA,I think it is worth pointing out to the House,38
NA,"that, quite legally and consistently with the",38
NA,"GATT rules, that does constitute some direct",38
NA,"assistance to exporters. There is no doubt,",38
NA,"however, that the concessional finance that",38
NA,EFIC provides is direct assistance to export-,38
NA,ers; that is certainly not debatable. I thought,38
NA,that this point was made very well in Profes-,38
NA,sor Helen Hughes's excellent report which,38
NA,was produced in July 1989 entitled Australian,38
NA,Exports-Performance Obstacles and Issues,38
NA,"of Assistance, which I commend to",38
NA,"Government members-of course, they would",38
NA,have read it at the time it was produced-to,38
NA,read yet again. Quite apart from its analysis,38
NA,of these issues of direct assistance to export-,38
NA,"ers, on pages 28, 29 and 30 it has a very",38
NA,useful analysis of the enormous benefits to,38
NA,Australia's balance of payments of introduc-,38
NA,ing a broadly based goods and services tax.,39
NA,The Minister for Science and Technology and,39
NA,Minister Assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Free),39
NA,might like to read that. I do not think he,39
NA,could have read that part of the report.,39
NA,A point is made in that report about,39
NA,concessional finance. If the House would bear,39
NA,"with me, I would like to read a little of it:",39
NA,Such concessional finance is seen as a defenSive,39
NA,measure to protect the competitive position of,39
NA,"Australian exporters in world markets, when facing",39
NA,'soft' loans of competitors. The exploitation of such,39
NA,official credits by exporters with resulting high,39
NA,budgetary costs led the OECD's Arrangement on,39
NA,Guidelines/or Officially Supported Export Credits,39
NA,which sets minimum interest rates and maximum,39
NA,credit periods for the financing of capital goods,39
NA,"exports. Together with the Berne union, which is",39
NA,"a clearing house for official insurers such as EFIC,",39
NA,these arrangements damp down the costs of export,39
NA,finance and insurance subsidies. The participants,39
NA,are fully aware that export finance subsidies are as,39
NA,harmful as any other subsidies to trade. They,39
NA,damage small countries-,39
NA,which obviously includes a country such as,39
NA,our own-,39
NA,and developing country exporters which have to,39
NA,draw on limited resources to match industrial,39
NA,country subsidies.,39
NA,"It is worth reflecting on that, and the points",39
NA,"that Helen Hughes made in her report, be-",39
NA,cause it raises the question of whether the,39
NA,work of EFIC can be justified at all. I think,39
NA,the defence of EFIC's existence is the,39
NA,"common defence that, as long as other count-",39
NA,"ries are doing it, it leaves us in a position",39
NA,"where, if we did not provide that concessional",39
NA,finance consistent with the OECD guide-,39
NA,"lines-the quote from Professor Hughes,",39
NA,"which I have just read out, referred to the",39
NA,"guidelines-we would lose market share,",39
NA,particularly in terms of exports of capital,39
NA,goods in a range of important markets. .,39
NA,I particularly refer to the south-east and,39
NA,north-east Asian markets. Most of those,39
NA,"countries, outside Japan, are defined as",39
NA,developing countries and they are in our,39
NA,"region. People like me, you, Mr Deputy",39
NA,"Speaker, and some honourable members of",39
NA,"the Government, have advocated for a long",39
NA,time that we need to be more effective exportEFIC,39
NA,ers into those markets and that as an economy,39
NA,we need to integrate more successfully with,39
NA,the north-east and south-east Asian econo-,39
NA,mies. One of the problems we have in getting,39
NA,into those markets and maintaining market,39
NA,"access once we have got into them is that,",39
NA,compared with the amount we devote for,39
NA,"these purposes, the European Community,",39
NA,Japan and the United States spend an enor-,39
NA,mous amoUnt of money on providing so-,39
NA,called mixed credits and other forms of,39
NA,financial assistance for their own capital,39
NA,goods exporters.,39
NA,We on this side of the House are trying to,39
NA,get some analysis done on the impact on,39
NA,trading opportunities for Australia in that part,39
NA,of the world of the types of financial subsi-,39
NA,"dies that are coming from Europe, the United",39
NA,States and Japan. There is no doubt that if we,39
NA,were to take away the concessional finance,39
NA,for the export of capital goods that EPIC,39
NA,provides we would have less opportunity in,39
NA,those markets than we currently have. I think,39
NA,the purist would argue-everybody must,39
NA,consider this-that the cost of providing that,39
NA,concessional finance needs to be properly,39
NA,understood. We need to understand what the,39
NA,net benefits of providing the concessional,39
NA,"finance are, and not take a simplistic view of",39
NA,the gross benefits because the gross benefits,39
NA,are obvious. I think the evidence seems to,39
NA,suggest that the net benefits are there; that it,39
NA,is a cost which is far exceeded in terms of the,39
NA,benefit from those exports to those particular,39
NA,markets.,39
NA,Given that for the time being the,39
NA,"concessional finance function, in particular,",39
NA,but also the other insurance functions under-,39
NA,"taken by EFIC are justified, at least for as",39
NA,long as the OECD retains its code to provide,39
NA,"for concessional finance, should the OECD",39
NA,take that code away-I would hope it would,39
NA,eventually because I do not think it is in our,39
NA,interests as a smaller country to have that type,39
NA,of code in place-we will probably have to,39
NA,stick with this concessional finance. Once it,39
NA,goes we will be a major beneficiary of the,39
NA,disappearance of that type of concessional,39
NA,finance.,39
NA,If one is prepared to accept the role of,39
NA,"in performing this function, it begs the",39
NA,question of how successfully EPIC is handling,39
NA,the whole issue of concessional finance. In a,39
NA,recent Estimates committee hearing my,40
NA,colleague Senator Bishop raised-quite,40
NA,appropriately in the context of this debate-,40
NA,the subject of the concessional finance provid-,40
NA,ed by EPIC for the construction of a boat,40
NA,called The Other Woman. This scandal was,40
NA,well and truly exposed by Senator Bishop and,40
NA,has subsequently been reasonably well publi-,40
NA,cised. When this Bill finally reaches the,40
NA,"Senate, Senator Bishop will have more to say",40
NA,on that particular issue. Suffice it for me to,40
NA,"say, as the shadow Minister for trade, that this",40
NA,is an issue of some concern to us. In particu-,40
NA,"lar, the potential of much of that money is",40
NA,simply being lost. When Senator Bishop talks,40
NA,about the totality of the finance provided for,40
NA,The Other Woman she is not just referring to,40
NA,funding that has come from EPIC. A lot of,40
NA,that money has been paid in the form of the,40
NA,"shipbuilding bounty. Nevertheless, some of it",40
NA,does come from EPIC. We want more ques-,40
NA,tions answered on that particular issue.,40
NA,"In the same vein, we have been told",40
NA,number of contacts in the finance community,40
NA,that EPIC has lost anything up to $110m in,40
NA,the shipbuilding industry alone. We would this year.,40
NA,like to know more about that. Perhaps when,40
NA,the Minister for Science and Technology,40
NA,Minister Assisting the Treasurer responds,40
NA,today he might be able to give us some,40
NA,confirmation or otherwise that EPIC has,40
NA,considerable losses in the shipbuilding indusadvantage,40
NA,try. While the Minister is about it he might,40
NA,care to let the coalition and the Australian,40
NA,public know-since EFIC is a public instituguarantee,40
NA,tion-what the total value of EFIC's current,40
NA,non-performing loans is and what is the gross,40
NA,value of its losses over the last three or,40
NA,years. When we have that information we,40
NA,be able to assess more satisfactorily the,40
NA,"strength of EPIC's position, the quality of",40
NA,"management and, flowing naturally from that,",40
NA,the quality of its capacity to handle,40
NA,concessional finance.,40
NA,We have an organisation which is to some,40
NA,extent picking winners and deciding where,40
NA,money is going to be allocated and where,40
NA,otherwise it might not be allocated. Many of,40
NA,those decisions are supposed to be made with,40
NA,the imprimatur of the Minister. I think we,40
NA,this Parliament have a right to know the total,40
NA,"value of EPIC's non-performing loans, the",40
NA,total value of any gross losses which have,40
NA,accrued and the nature of those losses.,40
NA,The coalition has undertaken a rather brief,40
NA,review of EPIC and how it works. We will be,40
NA,doing more work on it in the weeks ahead. In,40
NA,our consideration of the existence of EPIC we,40
NA,"have really gone back to the basic point,",40
NA,which I have in a sense briefly touched on,40
NA,"already, of whether we need to continue with",40
NA,EPIC at all.,40
NA,"Secondly, given that I have answered that",40
NA,"already in my remarks so far, we have looked",40
NA,to see whether it would be possible to transfer,40
NA,an institution such as EPIC to the private,40
NA,sector. It is reasonable that that matter be,40
NA,given some thought. The conclusion that I,40
NA,have reached is that to do that would be very,40
NA,difficult. I suppose international precedent,40
NA,gives us a guide. In the United Kingdom and,40
NA,"the United States the equivalent organisations,",40
NA,the Eximbapk in the United States and the,40
NA,"by a ECGD in the United Kingdom, have not in",40
NA,"general been privati sed, although some of the",40
NA,functions of the ECGD were privatised earlier,40
NA,If we are considering privatising something,40
NA,and we have to generate a certain amount of,40
NA,interest in buying the asset within the busi-,40
NA,ness community. I do not detect that at this,40
NA,"had stage. In its present form, EPIC has the",40
NA,of the government guarantee and,40
NA,therefore the capacity to borrow fairly cheap-,40
NA,ly. If we privatised it without a government,40
NA,it would lose the commercial edge,40
NA,that it currently has. We could continue to,40
NA,provide the government guarantee but to do,40
NA,four that would beg the question of why we would,40
NA,will provide a government guarantee to one,40
NA,"private company, albeit a specialised banking",40
NA,"its or non-banking financial institution, and not",40
NA,provide an identical guarantee to another,40
NA,institution. That is not an easy matter.,40
NA,The third point that we have considered is,40
NA,the relationship between the existing EFIC,40
NA,and the Australian banking system. EPIC,40
NA,offers nearly all of the medium term,40
NA,concessionalloans for exports that are provid-,40
NA,ed in Australia. Under the Act in the past,40
NA,in commercial banks have been able to lend and,40
NA,get an EPIC subsidy for their lending. In,40
NA,"other words, the concessional loans facility",41
NA,has been able to operate through the private,41
NA,banking sector. Suffice it to say that it is very,41
NA,rare for that to happen. It seems to me that,41
NA,one of the reasons that it has been very rare,41
NA,for that to happen is that it is a lot easier for,41
NA,the business community to go to a single,41
NA,purpose bank to get funding for projects of,41
NA,that kind rather than to shop around at differ-,41
NA,"ent banks and, in turn, try to persuade banks",41
NA,to apply for the concessions. Maybe the banks,41
NA,would be successful and maybe they would,41
NA,"not. Clearly, it is a complicated bureaucratic",41
NA,process when compared with going to a single,41
NA,purpose bank.,41
NA,Having been rather negative about issues,41
NA,"such as the privatisation of EPIC and, as an",41
NA,"alternative, the banks simply taking over the",41
NA,"functions of EPIC and closing EPIC down,",41
NA,there are things that could be done in order to,41
NA,improve the performance of EPIC and im-,41
NA,prove its relationship with the general banking,41
NA,community. A number of exporters have,41
NA,complained to me about delays in EPIC,41
NA,giving approval for work that the exporters,41
NA,have wanted done by EPIC. Some have,41
NA,claimed that they have missed contracts as a,41
NA,result of EPIC's delays. Presumably these,41
NA,"delays, it would be argued, are caused by a",41
NA,shortage of staff and the only answer would,41
NA,be to increase the overall level of staffing in,41
NA,EPIC. If we were to do that we would reduce,41
NA,"its competitiveness by increasing its cost, and",41
NA,one has to make a balanced judgment about,41
NA,that. I point out to the House that that is an,41
NA,issue that has been raised by a number of,41
NA,exporters. It is an issue of some concern.,41
NA,Whether there are ways of eliminating those,41
NA,"delays or not, it is certainly something that",41
NA,more work needs to be done on. I will come,41
NA,later to how that possibly could be done.,41
NA,It has also been said by some that EPIC's,41
NA,"lack of a worldwide network, as compared",41
NA,"with some of the major international banks,",41
NA,means that as a financial institution assisting,41
NA,"exporters EPIC is unab,le to be as effective as",41
NA,an institution with a more extensive world-,41
NA,wide network. I am not proffering any simple,41
NA,"solutions as to how we would achieve that,",41
NA,just as I am not offering simple solutions as,41
NA,to how we would deal with the delays in,41
NA,EPIC.,41
NA,I would like to put a proposal to the,41
NA,Government. If it were reasonable about this,41
NA,and took debate in the Parliament on an issue,41
NA,such as this seriously-I think it should,41
NA,because that is what the Parliament is for-it,41
NA,might wish to establish a joint EFIC-banIdng,41
NA,industry working group to examine whether,41
NA,the commercial banks can play a bigger role,41
NA,in providing some of the services that EPIC,41
NA,is currently providing or assist with the,41
NA,provision of those services.,41
NA,Mr Martin-Or perhaps send them to a,41
NA,committee of the House of Representatives.,41
Mr DOWNER,That is right. As a matter,41
NA,"of fact, the honourable member for Macarthur,",41
NA,the Chairman of the House of Representatives,41
NA,Standing Committee on Pinance and Public,41
NA,"Administration, which is inquiring into the",41
NA,"banking industry, would be aware that there",41
NA,has been very little discussion-I accept some,41
NA,responsibility for this-in that Committee on,41
NA,this particular issue. Given that the,41
NA,Committee's work is coming to a rapid,41
NA,"conclusion, it may be a little late for it to do",41
NA,much work on that. I accept some responsi-,41
NA,bility for less work being done on that than,41
NA,could have been. There might be other forums,41
NA,where that could be done more usefully. I,41
NA,"suggest that, if we did have a joint working",41
NA,"group of EPIC and the banks, we might come",41
NA,up with a more rapid conclusion than we,41
NA,would if we depended on recommendations,41
NA,coming from a parliamentary committee-not,41
NA,to belittle the parliamentary committee.,41
NA,It is interesting to note that in Britain and,41
NA,the United States the ECGD and the,41
NA,Eximbank both contract out to the banking,41
NA,sector much more of the concessional finance,41
NA,work than is done here in Australia. Compa-,41
NA,rable organisations in those two countries and,41
NA,their relationship with the banking community,41
NA,might be a good place to start.,41
NA,The argument goes that if one were able to,41
NA,"use the existing commercial banking system,",41
NA,"rather than depending entirely on EPIC, one",41
NA,might be able to lower the Government's total,41
NA,borrowing program for EFIC. It might give a,41
NA,greater opportunity for risk sharing between,41
NA,"EFIC and the banks themselves, and that",41
NA,would have an obvious advantage. There,42
NA,might be some capacity to reduce the redepartment,42
NA,"sponse time for exporters' inquiries,",42
NA,have raised that issue already. It might give,42
NA,a wider based delivery system to provide,42
NA,greater opportunity for new and smaller,42
NA,exporters to take advantage of subsidised,42
NA,export finance. It might help with the promoBill,42
NA,tion of increased export awareness and experiance,42
NA,ence amongst Australian capital goods manuConsequential,42
NA,facturers. It would provide the opportunity,42
NA,have a complete one-stop shop financial,42
NA,packaging service using the commercial Minister,42
NA,"banks, rather than going to commercial banks,",42
NA,being shuffled off to EFIC and having,42
NA,both with commercial banks and EFIC. There,42
NA,"is, I suppose, the potential for EFIC to",42
NA,"achieve cost savings, particularly in the area",42
NA,"of marketing and analysis. Finally,",42
NA,interchange of information between banks and,42
NA,EFIC and the improved feedback and advice,42
NA,on changes in market conditions and/or,42
NA,requirements would be another benefit that,42
NA,could flow from that.,42
NA,I am not being prescriptive about this.,42
NA,saying that the Government should consider,42
NA,establishing a working group of EFIC and the,42
NA,banks to see whether more could be done.,42
NA,The Government itself would probably have,42
NA,"to participate in the working group, providing",42
NA,"a fair bit of guidance and promoting ideas,",42
NA,particularly on the basis of experience in,42
NA,United Kingdom and the United States.,42
NA,"In conclusion, the coalition supports the",42
NA,Bill. We hope that the Government will,42
NA,examine the feasibility of establishing,42
NA,"working group that I have referred to, and",42
NA,hope that the Government will decide to,42
NA,change tack on one thing: instead of putting,42
NA,DITAC in the negligent hands of Senator,42
NA,"Button, who has administered Austrade and",42
NA,EFIC with a most extraordinary degree of,42
NA,negligence over the last five or,42
NA,should have EFIC more logically transferred,42
NA,so that it is under the ministerial control of,42
NA,the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.,42
NA,"I do not say that out of former vested interest,",42
NA,because once I used to be an officer of the,42
NA,"Department of Foreign Affairs, but simply",42
NA,because I think there is irrefutable logic,42
NA,"having EFIC, Austrade, AIDAB and the they",42
NA,whole area of trade policy handlecl by one,42
NA,rather than being spread through-,42
NA,and I out the bureaucracy.,42
Mr MARTIN ,Macarthur) (4.28 p.m.)-,42
NA,This afternoon I wish to speak in support of,42
NA,the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation,42
NA,1991 and the Export Finance and Insur-,42
NA,Corporation (Transitional Provisions and,42
NA,Amendments) Bill 1991 which,42
NA,to have been introduced into this place by the,42
NA,Minister for Science and Technology and,42
NA,Assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Free). As,42
NA,"we have heard, the legislation will re-establish",42
NA,to deal the Export Finance and Insurance,42
NA,"Corporation, known as EFIC, and it will do",42
NA,so as an independent statutory corporation,42
NA,offering competitiv-'export credit facilities for,42
NA,the greater Australian exporters.,42
NA,Like the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr,42
NA,"Downer), I welcome this initiative. I also",42
NA,support somtf of the comments that he has,42
NA,"made, particularly in respect of looking at",42
NA,"ways in which a body such as this, working",42
NA,"I am within the private finance community, can",42
NA,improve the opportunities for Australian,42
NA,"exporters. In all sincerity, I say to him that his",42
NA,suggestion about considering some sort of,42
NA,working group made up of EFIC and banks,42
NA,to look at ways to assist in that enhancement,42
NA,of Australian export opportunities and en-,42
NA,the hance the provision of finance for that is a,42
NA,reasonable suggestion. Despite some of the,42
NA,comments he made about the present inquiry,42
NA,into the Australian banking industry by the,42
NA,Standing Committee on Finance and Public,42
NA,"the Administration, that could be a possible",42
NA,we ongoing reference for a committee of the,42
NA,Parliament in the early parts of the new year,42
NA,if a potential recommendation creating a,42
NA,permanent watchdog on the banking industry,42
NA,was accepted by the Government. That may,42
NA,or may not be one of the Committee's recom-,42
NA,"so years, it mendations next month.",42
NA,"In relation to that particular proposal, it is",42
NA,also worth commenting about the role of,42
NA,Australian banks at the present time and what,42
NA,the future actually holds for them in respect,42
NA,of expanding opportunities for Australian,42
NA,in exporters to gain finance and assistance so,42
NA,can get into the markets that exist in,42
NA,"Asia, particularly, and in other parts of the",43
NA,world.,43
NA,As the Australian financial community,43
NA,"changes, as it inevitably will, we will find",43
NA,"more and more Australian banks, particularly,",43
NA,becoming globalised. We have seen this in a,43
NA,number of Australian banks taking corporate,43
NA,decisions to locate rather extensive offices in,43
NA,overseas jurisdictions. We have seen the,43
NA,opportunity taken by some of Australia's,43
NA,major banks to acquire the overseas holdings,43
NA,of other banks and therefore establish them-,43
NA,selves a real presence in another market. This,43
NA,can only lead to the enhancement of Australia,43
NA,"as an exporting nation, particularly in relation",43
NA,to access to finance.,43
NA,In some way that would complement what,43
NA,is being proposed in the legislation before the,43
NA,"House today. For example, the ANZ's recent",43
NA,"takeover of Grindlays Bank provides, an",43
NA,"enormous network, particularly throughout",43
NA,Europe. And the National Australia Bank has,43
NA,taken over a couple of the northern England,43
NA,banks. Again this is an inroad into a part of,43
NA,Europe which is going to become more and,43
NA,"more important, particularly as we move to",43
NA,"1993, with virtual elimination of all trade and",43
NA,"finance barriers, and perhaps even monetary",43
NA,"barriers, between all members of the",43
NA,European Community.,43
NA,For Australia it is very important not to lose,43
NA,"sight of that point, because if we can have",43
NA,"already established, through the assistance of",43
NA,"EFIC and Austrade, working hand in glove",43
NA,"with the private finance community, a ready",43
NA,"access into many of those markets, and the",43
NA,"provision of finance to assist in that, then the",43
NA,Australian opportunity for export enhance-,43
NA,ment has to grow. It is quite amazing to think,43
NA,that few people realise that Australia is now,43
NA,running a merchandise trade surplus; in such,43
NA,difficult economic times as we have at the,43
NA,"moment, that is probably a point that has been",43
NA,lost.,43
NA,Any opportunity to enhance our export,43
NA,potential is something which we must grasp,43
NA,with both hands. -ast year the actual mer-,43
NA,chandise trade surplus was something like,43
NA,"$2.5 billion, and that was certainly a turn-",43
NA,around from the $3.2 billion deficit of the,43
NA,year before. Something must be happening,43
NA,now; something must be right. As more and,43
NA,more Australian exporters are looking to ways,43
NA,"in which they can enhance their opportunities,",43
NA,"particularly in the Asian region, which is",43
NA,"more and more the market for Australia, we",43
NA,need to provide the financial advice and,43
NA,assistance for those exporters to get into those,43
NA,markets.,43
NA,"EPIC, of course, will be much better",43
NA,equipped to assist in today's competitive,43
NA,"export climate, because it must operate in a",43
NA,"more commercial, and therefore accountable,",43
NA,"way. In the Government's view, of course,",43
NA,this will be best assured by establishing EFIC,43
NA,as a statutory corporation. I have no disagree-,43
NA,"ment with that, because the Corporation will",43
NA,be structured along government business,43
NA,enterprise lines. It will therefore continue to,43
NA,fill the gap that I have identified in what the,43
NA,commercial banks and financial organisations,43
NA,are prepared to do by providing services,43
NA,which are not normally available through the,43
NA,private sector. It will be complementary to,43
NA,that.,43
NA,I think the honourable member for Mayo,43
NA,raised a very valid point-a joint working,43
NA,arrangement might be established where we,43
NA,can see the best of both worlds. To date,43
NA,EFIC's business has been at no cost to the,43
NA,taxpayer. It undertakes its transactions which,43
NA,the Government considers to be in the,43
NA,national interest. I think that is quite import-,43
NA,ant. It usually involves high risk and very,43
NA,"important industry, trade or political consider-",43
NA,ations. So if there is not a body in place,43
NA,which enables finance to be made available,43
NA,"for those export industries, the chances are",43
NA,that industry would fall over. So for those,43
NA,"very real industry, trade or political consider-",43
NA,ations to have a body such as EFIC in place,43
NA,is quite appropriate in my view.,43
NA,The total exposure on the national interest,43
NA,account is something like $1. 3 billion of,43
NA,which the greater bulk relates to commodity,43
NA,"exports, particularly wheat and wool. I do not",43
NA,know whether that will continue in the future;,43
NA,"in fact my view is that that might change,",43
NA,particularly in regard to some other commodi-,43
NA,ties which we in this country are able to,43
NA,produce.,43
NA,I represent a coal producing area of New,44
NA,South Wales. I note in an article in today's,44
NA,Australian Financial Review that it might be,44
NA,facing some difficult times in the future. It,44
NA,may well be that EPIC or some other consor-,44
NA,tium project that might be entered into would,44
NA,need to be looked at to provide assistance to,44
NA,industries such as the coal industry. As I,44
NA,"understand it, the coal producing areas of this",44
NA,country will soon be faced with rather com-,44
NA,petitive forces in respect of the prices they are,44
NA,"likely to receive, particularly from Japanese",44
NA,"coal buyers, simply because the demand has",44
NA,slackened as a result of the recession not only,44
NA,in this country but right around the world.,44
NA,That cannot mean good things for Australian,44
NA,"commodity exporters, particularly of primary",44
NA,produce such as coal. I look forward to seeing,44
NA,continuing reports on that particular matter.,44
NA,The Government's 12 March statement,44
NA,Building a More Competitive Australia recog-,44
NA,nised the need for Australian exporters to,44
NA,have access to competitive financial facilities,44
NA,"and to be effective, especially in the Asia-",44
NA,Pacific markets. I have commented on how,44
NA,significant Asia really is. The Government,44
NA,announced its intention in that statement to,44
NA,re-establish EPIC as a separate entity to,44
NA,Austrade with greater visibility and an extend-,44
NA,ed range of services for exporters. As part of,44
NA,"this restructuring, a $200m callable capital",44
NA,facility is to be provided to supplement,44
NA,EPIC's existing reserves of some $160m.,44
NA,"This, of course, is bound to ensure adequate",44
NA,"financial backing for its insurance, guarantee",44
NA,and lending operations.,44
NA,It is interesting to note that at the moment,44
NA,EPIC covers something like 10 per cent of,44
NA,Australia's trade. As more and more,44
NA,Australian producers look at opportunities to,44
NA,ex.port overseas-hopefully not to export,44
NA,"unfinished products or to sell our coal, our",44
NA,wool and our wheat overseas and then buy it,44
NA,back as jumpers or something else-and are,44
NA,moving towards some sort of an exportable,44
NA,product which has been treated in this country,44
NA,"before it is exported, perhaps we might see",44
NA,that 10 per cent figure rise as far as EPIC is,44
NA,concerned. I certainly hope that is the case.,44
NA,In 1990-91 EPIC supported exports totalling,44
NA,some $4.5 billion. That is not an insignificant,44
NA,"amount and one can, therefore j see how",44
NA,important this organisation is in supporting,44
NA,Australian exporters. It also insures offshore,44
NA,investments by Australian companies against,44
NA,non-commercial loss caused by things such as,44
NA,"exchange transfer blockages, expropriation or",44
NA,war damage. We would have seen some of,44
NA,the benefits flowing to Australian exporters,44
NA,because of the recent crises in the world. The,44
NA,cover on these investments totals something,44
NA,like $490m.,44
NA,"As has been indicated, the legislation does",44
NA,re-establish a body which has been operating,44
NA,for quite some time-some 35 years. It will,44
NA,"enhance Australia's, export potential. In my",44
NA,view it will certainly supplement export,44
NA,activities and finat1cial activities which are not,44
NA,covered by private banks and by other finan-,44
NA,cial institutions. It will go some way towards,44
NA,supporting Australia's drive to increase the,44
NA,level of exports from this country. Again I,44
NA,"come back ,-o the point that it must not simply",44
NA,"be primary produce, the stuff that we rip out",44
NA,of the ground and then send away to someone,44
NA,else to manufacture and to sell back to us.,44
NA,Australia must move more and more to-,44
NA,wards-and the economic climate and,44
NA,government policy must continue to create-,44
NA,an environment whereby Australian exporters,44
NA,will feel safe in the knowledge that they can,44
NA,export finished products which have had some,44
NA,"treatment in this country and, therefore, gain",44
NA,a greater advantage for this country. We must,44
NA,move more and more towards that. I suggest,44
NA,that this can only be done through initiatives,44
NA,"by the Government in industry policy, starting",44
NA,with the 12 March statement and being,44
NA,carried forWard with initiatives such as this,44
NA,"but, even more so, by looking at conditions",44
NA,which are created in this country to encourage,44
NA,exporters.,44
NA,I will make one other comment on Austrade,44
NA,and the role it has played. I was part of a,44
NA,delegation looking at the banking system of,44
NA,the United States and had the opportunity to,44
NA,talk with our representative in the mid-west,44
NA,of the United States. He told me and the,44
NA,"Deputy Chairman of the Committee, the",44
NA,"honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson),",44
NA,that in the last couple of years Austrade,44
NA,representatives and staff at the Austrade office,44
NA,"in the mid-west of the United States-that is,",45
NA,out of Chicago-have decreased from five,45
NA,people to one. Yet this is an absolutely,45
NA,"massive market which Australia could, with",45
NA,"a bit of work, tap into.",45
NA,I find it rather extraordinary when I think,45
NA,of some of the initiatives that have been,45
NA,demonstrated through the Austrade office to,45
NA,identify the appropriate markets for Australia.,45
NA,If those people have been taken from the,45
NA,United States and put into Asia because we,45
NA,have identified that Asia offers a better,45
NA,"strategy for Australian exporters, that is fine.",45
NA,If we can see that translated into increased,45
NA,exports from Australia into Asia and that this,45
NA,turns around balance of payments difficulties,45
NA,"for this country, that is fine, I have no diffi-",45
NA,"culty with that at all. However, if there is-",45
NA,"and I believe there is-a massive, lucrative",45
NA,market in the mid-west of the United States,45
NA,for many of the products produced in this,45
NA,"country, then perhaps it is a little short-sightbody;",45
NA,ed not to have the level of trade representa-,45
NA,tion which we probably need in such a lo-,45
NA,cation. There are probably many other parts,45
NA,of the United States we could give the flick,45
NA,"to, but I think this is one which should be re-",45
NA,examined. I ask the Minister whether this,45
NA,issue could be taken on board with the repre-,45
NA,sentatives of Austrade and in the appropriate,45
NA,department.,45
NA,"In conclusion, I come back to the point I",45
NA,made at the beginning: this is part of an,45
NA,ongoing commitment by this Government to,45
NA,ensure that the appropriate infrastructure is in,45
NA,place for the promotion and export of,45
NA,Australian products. It is aimed essentially at,45
NA,turning around difficult circumstances for the,45
NA,Australian economy in trying to meet our,45
NA,terms of trade and our balance of payments,45
NA,situation. It is to be encouraged. I hope it is,45
NA,one of several steps the Government is look-,45
NA,ing at to continue that process. I commend the,45
NA,legislation to the House.,45
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (4.43,45
NA,p.m.)-The development of an export con-,45
NA,sciousness and providing the opportunity for,45
NA,"small business and, indeed, anybody in",45
NA,business in Australia to export their products,45
NA,is absolutely critical. I have had some years,45
NA,of ministerial experience in this body that is,45
NA,being discussed today. I want to look at a,45
NA,number of aspects of the Export Finance and,45
NA,Insurance Corporation Bill and the Export,45
NA,Finance and Insurance Corporation (Transi-,45
NA,tional Provisions and Consequential Amend-,45
NA,ments) Bill. and express some cynicism about,45
NA,the establishment of yet another corporation.,45
NA,For many years the Reserve Bank had,45
NA,prime responsibility for our primary export,45
NA,"industries, for funding the Wheat Board and",45
NA,"so on, and I do not demur from the fact that",45
NA,the Reserve Bank no longer operates there to,45
NA,the same degree. But I am concerned that this,45
NA,legislation really is a product of the,45
NA,Government having made a mess of the whole,45
NA,trade area. At the moment it has three depart-,45
NA,ments. I suppose one would call one a depart-,45
NA,ment and a half as it has two Ministers,45
NA,responsible for the field of trade.,45
NA,"We have EPIC, which is a long established",45
NA,"as has been said, it has been going for",45
NA,about 35 years. It is a body which provides an,45
NA,essential service. I will come back and look,45
NA,at that service and at the legislation and,45
NA,where it is taking us. But what has happened,45
NA,is that Austrade has made an absolute disaster,45
NA,of the responsibilities that have been accorded,45
NA,to it. More and more I am coming back to the,45
NA,position that I adopted initially. when it was,45
NA,"established. of saying, 'The sooner it is",45
NA,scrapped the better'. I will come to Austrade,45
NA,in relation to other matters as I conclude my,45
NA,remarks. EPIC certainly has not worked,45
NA,within Austrade. The reason this legislation is,45
NA,before us is that at long last the Government,45
NA,is realising that.,45
NA,We have to see whether we are helping the,45
NA,"people in Australia who want to export and,",45
NA,for the people who at the moment do not even,45
NA,"know about export, whether it will make it",45
NA,easier for them to export. Words are great. I,45
NA,have read the Minister's second reading,45
NA,speech and I have heard what has been said,45
NA,in the House today. We are all in favour of it;,45
NA,it is like motherhood. But it will not jolly,45
NA,well work unless we have some way of,45
NA,getting that sperm into the mother's womb to,45
NA,generate the infant. With the way things are,45
NA,going I do not think that this legislation is,45
NA,sufficient to provide that stimulus.,45
NA,I am concerned that setting up a new,46
NA,"corporation will not, of itself, solve the",46
NA,problems. There are aspects of it that I am,46
NA,"very pleased to see, but I am worried that we",46
NA,"have said, 'It is not working within Austrade,",46
NA,"Austrade is not working terribly well, so let",46
NA,us set up another statutory corporation'. It is,46
NA,a great old way to resolve problems. If it is,46
NA,"not a committee, it is a corporation. I can",46
NA,honourable members that corporations do not,46
NA,have an unblemished record in this nation of,46
NA,ours at the moment. I would rather like to see,46
NA,us provide the facilities to help Australians,46
NA,export. That is really the bottom line as far as,46
NA,I am concerned.,46
NA,I now come to the second thing that con-,46
NA,cerns me. I commend the honourable member,46
NA,for Mayo ( Mr Downer) and indeed the hon-,46
NA,"ourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin),",46
NA,both of whom picked up the idea of some,46
NA,consultation with banks and so on. But let me,46
NA,tell them that EFIC was really set up in the,46
NA,first place as an insurance corporation. The,46
NA,"concept was insurance and reinsurance, and",46
NA,"those remain the two main functions, although",46
NA,loans are a third part of EFIC's prime respon-,46
NA,sibilities. We also have to think of insurance,46
NA,companies.,46
NA,I know that in the legislation there is,46
NA,provision for entering into negotiations with,46
NA,"other financial institutions, but I think",46
NA,"have preferred, in the first place, that we had",46
NA,gone back to the Reserve Bank and given it,46
NA,this function until we got the thing worked,46
NA,out. I would like to see it operating very,46
NA,"much like the Primary Industry Bank, which",46
NA,"I legislated for and which was, as much as",46
NA,"anything, a product of discussions that I held",46
NA,"with the banks. On this basis, we do not have",46
NA,another great bureaucracy.,46
NA,The first thing that this body has to do is,46
NA,understand that it will not succeed if it is to,46
NA,have a representative in every port and every,46
NA,city. I come back briefly to what the honour-,46
NA,able member for Macarthur concluded about,46
NA,our shutting down trade offices. There have,46
NA,been so many disasters from this Government.,46
NA,This morning I read about even closing our,46
NA,diplomatic mission in Switzerland. I can tell,46
NA,the members of the Government that Swiss,46
NA,francs are still a significant part of Australian,46
NA,overseas reserves. We still borrow sigmficant-,46
NA,ly in Swiss francs. The Government has never,46
NA,had a forward plan of where to set up offices,46
NA,and why we should have them. Shutting down,46
NA,offices in places such as the western United,46
NA,"States, where there is a tremendous market for",46
NA,"Australian goods, just does not make sense,",46
NA,any more than it does to shut down offices in,46
NA,tell Switzerland. We have to work out how to,46
NA,"operate them more efficiently, but that is a",46
NA,"different story. Indeed, in the Swiss instance,",46
NA,I gather that we will turn to some,46
NA,international representatives that we have in,46
NA,"Geneva and say, 'We will not have a post, but",46
NA,you will somehow or other continue the job'.,46
NA,"For goodness sake, why can we not keep our",46
NA,"posts open and, if need be, appoint some of",46
NA,those who have an international responsibility,46
NA,as our ambassadors? Let us try to keep the,46
NA,"posts open, but do it under another name.",46
NA,The same thing is absolutely essential as far,46
NA,as EFIC is concerned. EFIC should not set up,46
NA,a post in every port. What it has to do is,46
NA,work with existing private sector operations.,46
NA,"Indeed, when we see that it covers only",46
NA,"around 10 per cent of Australia's trade, we",46
NA,realise that 90 per cent is already covered in,46
NA,other directions. I think we have to draw the,46
NA,line between big business trade and small,46
NA,business trade. One of the concerns that I,46
NA,I would have long had about our overseas trade,46
NA,arrangements is that we have not done any-,46
NA,where near enough to encourage the average,46
NA,small to medium sized business to get export,46
NA,oriented. Big business is normally okay. The,46
NA,"CRAs, the BHPs, the CSRs and so on of this",46
NA,world have their own access; they do not,46
NA,need to tum to the services of government.,46
NA,They do not need to turn to EFIC or,46
NA,Austrade. They rarely need to tum even to,46
NA,our own Department of Foreign Affairs and,46
NA,"Trade. They have their own network. So,",46
NA,when we are looking at that 10 per cent-,46
NA,because much of it may well relate to,46
NA,"agricultural commodities, and I believe it",46
NA,does-I am not too sure how much of small,46
NA,business is covered by it.,46
NA,"I should add, though, that I do not agree",46
NA,with the suggestion that this EFIC cover,46
NA,should apply only to value added products.,46
NA,There is a very real reason why we need to,46
NA,provide continued cover for our commodity,47
NA,"exports, and never more so than at a time",47
NA,when we are still beating at the door to get,47
NA,the Uruguay Round of GAIT going. We all,47
NA,know of the problems in Europe and of the,47
NA,difficulties of getting some change in the,47
NA,CAP; we know of the difficulties in Europe,47
NA,of providing access to eastern European,47
NA,agricultural goods and of the political require-,47
NA,ment that there be access into Europe for,47
NA,those goods. We know the difficulties we,47
NA,have in getting the Americans to move on,47
NA,their export enhancement program. We know,47
NA,of the problems that we have with Japan,47
NA,whereby we catmot even display a grain of,47
NA,rice let alone export Australian rice to Japan,47
NA,"for consumption by the Japanese people, even",47
NA,though we produce it more efficiently and,47
NA,more economically and to at least the same,47
NA,quality as Japanese rice.,47
NA,We have to look at EFIC and see what its,47
NA,task is and how it is going to carry it out. If,47
NA,"it is to be set up as a separate corporation, I",47
NA,would rather it be done in such a way that we,47
NA,had these discussions with the banks and,47
NA,"insurance companies first, because what I",47
NA,would like to see this body doing is not,47
NA,setting up offices everywhere but essentially,47
NA,"stimulating, lending and providing insurance",47
NA,through the private sector. It is for that reason,47
NA,that previously it was largely a government,47
NA,agency handled within the Department. As I,47
NA,"have said, I am not sure that, instead of",47
NA,"setting up a separate corporation, it could not",47
NA,"have been handled, at least at this stage,",47
NA,through the Reserve Bank. But if it is to be,47
NA,"a separate organisation, what it has to do is",47
NA,"try to stimulate, to provide reinsurance and to",47
NA,"provide, if need be, interest subsidies through",47
NA,existing private sector lending institutions and,47
NA,insurance institutions so that they can get on,47
NA,with their business and so that the EFIC,47
NA,purpose is predominantly met.,47
NA,The role of EFIC is set down in the legisla-,47
NA,"tion and, as I have said, it covers three things.",47
NA,"It covers insurance, reinsurance and loans. But",47
NA,there is a very important supplement to the,47
NA,normal role. One of the reasons why it is,47
NA,"specifically a government agency, and the",47
NA,"reason why privatisation will, I think, always",47
NA,"be difficult, is that it is absolutely essential",47
NA,for there to be a capacity for a national,47
NA,"interest cover. Of course, ministerial direc-",47
NA,tions and the way they are to be undertaken,47
NA,"are set down in clause 9, and clause 10",47
NA,provides for the way they are to be financed,47
NA,and so on.,47
NA,There are a couple of difficulties that I see,47
NA,in this. What normally happens is that in,47
NA,"markets that are considered to be a good risk,",47
NA,under the normal basis EFIC cover is taken,47
NA,up to a certain percentage of the loan; so that,47
NA,for a very good risk market EFIC might be,47
NA,prepared to advance on a 90 per cent insur-,47
NA,"ance basis, whereas if it is a poor risk market",47
NA,it will cut that down to 80 per cent or 70 per,47
NA,"cent, perhaps even lower. The difficulty is to",47
NA,"make sure, if we can, that markets that are",47
NA,important to us are in some way hedged when,47
NA,there are political difficulties. We know that,47
NA,there have been enormous problems in the,47
NA,Middle East. There are problems at the,47
NA,moment in eastern Europe with what was,47
NA,"Yugoslavia, for example. We need to have a",47
NA,way by which we can continue our exports,47
NA,"into markets of that ilk. Indeed, there has",47
NA,been no better example than that given in the,47
NA,Minister's speech when he referred to losses,47
NA,resulting fOlm the war in Iraq and the prob-,47
NA,lems there. There are enormous problems if,47
NA,we do not have this capacity to provide,47
NA,national interest cover.,47
NA,One of the reasons why I disagree with the,47
NA,"honourable member for Macarthur, for exam-",47
NA,"ple, in talking about the absolute necessity to",47
NA,maintain cover on our commodity exports is,47
NA,that we are able to gain advantages from,47
NA,providing some funding guarantees to the,47
NA,Soviet Union as far as wool and wheat are,47
NA,concerned. The Soviet Union does have a,47
NA,political element of risk. One will not find a,47
NA,normal commercial lender accepting the risk,47
NA,of funding exports to the Soviet Union to the,47
NA,degree that one might like. In the last few,47
NA,days there have been comments about the,47
NA,Belarus tractor group apparently seeking to,47
NA,acquire 50 per cent of the Australian wool,47
NA,"stockpile. Whatever the proposition, such",47
NA,propositions will not succeed in the light of,47
NA,"the political risk factor, unless we have some",47
NA,type of national risk area where directions can,47
NA,be given and where a supplemental insurance,47
NA,can be given through EPIC to cover what is,48
NA,an extraordinary risk.,48
NA,"To my mind, that is a critical role of EFIC.",48
NA,It is one of the reasons that we must retain,48
NA,the separate identity of EFIC outside the,48
NA,private sector. There needs to be a capacity to,48
NA,provide reinsurance for such a lending risk. I,48
NA,might add that I think the assistance provided,48
NA,in recent years by AIDAB in the lending area,48
NA,has been excellent. This has been a very,48
NA,important role of EFIC.,48
NA,The legislation provides for a couple of,48
NA,other obligations in respect of the national,48
NA,interest cover. I am pleased to see the require-,48
NA,ment for a corporate plan of this new-,48
NA,although I have reservations about this-,48
NA,"statutory corporation. This is, of course, to be",48
NA,"discussed predominantly with the Minister,",48
NA,although there is a capacity to report. I hope,48
NA,that there will be some details of the corpo-,48
NA,rate plan in the reporting requirements under,48
NA,the legislation. This is hedged in typical,48
NA,"ambivalence in clause 85(2) of the legislation,",48
NA,which states:,48
NA,"Subject to subsection (3), EFIC must include in",48
NA,each annual report:,48
NA,(a) particulars of every direction-,48
NA,this is in respect of national interest cover-,48
NA,(b) a statement of the principal objectives,48
NA,EFIC ...,48
NA,(c) an assessment of the extent to which EPIC,48
NA,has achieved its principal objectives...,48
NA,"I trust that clause 85(2)(b), which refers to a",48
NA,"statement of the principal objectives, will",48
NA,ensure that we will see elements of the corpo-,48
NA,rate plan that is referred to earlier in the,48
NA,legislation. I think it is essential that the,48
NA,report should not only deal with the national,48
NA,interest cover. I am pleased to see that there,48
NA,is a requirement for national interest contracts,48
NA,to be gazetted. There will be a capacity for,48
NA,people to see what national interest directions,48
NA,have been given and what cover is provided.,48
NA,"As far as the corporate plan is concerned, I",48
NA,suggest that there is a requirement that an,48
NA,exposure should be made to the public and,48
NA,"that, of course, can only be done through the",48
NA,"annual report. I trust that the Minister, in his",48
NA,"response, might refer to this aspect.",48
NA,I would like to make a couple of remarks,48
NA,about the constitution of the EPIC board. First,48
NA,"""f all, I was delighted to read in the",48
NA,Minister's second reading speech that Reg,48
NA,"Nicolson, the recently retired Deputy Manag-",48
NA,"ing Director of the ANZ Bank, is to head up",48
NA,the new board. There is no reference at this,48
NA,stage to other officers or the Managing Direc-,48
NA,tor. But I think it is important that there,48
NA,"should be, to the maximum extent possible, a",48
NA,link with the existing private financial sector,48
NA,in Australia. We do not want as members of,48
NA,the board just those people who are involved,48
NA,in normal trade and commerce. We also want,48
NA,"people who have financial and, I would",48
NA,"suggest, insurance links. Through them I think",48
NA,there will be a better chance of liaison and of,48
NA,achieving the link with the banking sector and,48
NA,the insurance sector to which both the hon-,48
NA,ourable member for Mayo and the honourable,48
NA,member for Macarthur referred. The whole,48
NA,character and nature of EPIC will be retained,48
NA,only if EFIC is supplemental to the financing,48
NA,provisions that are made available to the 90,48
NA,per cent of exports that it does not now cover.,48
NA,. The concept of EFIC is important. As I,48
NA,"have said, I think it might well have been",48
NA,better if EPIC had been under the Reserve,48
NA,Bank for a while. We would then not have,48
NA,needed another statutory corporation. The,48
NA,of legislation might have evolved in a different,48
NA,way if discussions had been held with banks,48
NA,and insurance houses.,48
NA,"Like the honourable member for Mayo, I",48
NA,have real reservations about the whole struc-,48
NA,ture of the administration of trade. As I have,48
NA,"said, DITAC is responsible for one area of",48
NA,"trade, particularly Austrade. We have a",48
NA,Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and a,48
NA,Minister for Trade and Overseas Develop-,48
NA,ment. We had three Ministers. But divided,48
NA,responsibility is no way in which to maximise,48
NA,output at this time.,48
NA,"If it were not for a fourth Minister, there",48
NA,would be virtually no dealing in what is the,48
NA,"principal area of Australian exports. I refer, of",48
NA,"course, to the Minister for Primary Industries",48
NA,and Energy. So we really have four Ministers,48
NA,involved. That fourth Minister's portfolio,48
NA,"covers oil, gas and all the minerals, including",48
NA,"coal, to which the honourable member for",48
NA,Macarthur referred. He is also responsible for,49
NA,"wheat, wool and all of our other agricultural",49
NA,exports. I do not find that division very,49
NA,satisfactory.,49
NA,I know that there are problems in trying to,49
NA,achieve total coordination. But I think it is,49
NA,"critical that, within an area where there is also",49
NA,"an association with Finance and Treasury, we",49
NA,do not have too many people trying to admin-,49
NA,"ister. For that reason, I would be inclined to",49
NA,accept the suggestion of the honourable,49
NA,member for Mayo that it would be far better,49
NA,if EFIC were at least to be responsible to the,49
NA,Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for as,49
NA,long as he retains a trade responsibility. I,49
NA,might say that for my money I would far,49
NA,"prefer to see a separate department of trade,",49
NA,perhaps linked with one of the major depart-,49
NA,ments in the way that was done in previous,49
NA,coalition governments.,49
NA,"In opening, I said that I wanted to address",49
NA,briefly some of the problems that will emerge,49
NA,from the severance of this responsibility from,49
NA,Austrade. It is difficult in this day and age to,49
NA,know just how one can best provide the sort,49
NA,of service that exporters require. The,49
NA,MCKinsey report certainly identified adminis-,49
NA,trative problems in Austrade. There are real,49
NA,difficulties. The honourable member for,49
NA,"Macarthur suggested where, how and to what",49
NA,degree Austrade provides its present services.,49
NA,Even this morning I read about a small,49
NA,exporter who said that Austrade services did,49
NA,not relate to the assistance he was seeking.,49
NA,"This exporter was told, 'They did not really",49
NA,know anything about it but they were going,49
NA,to charge an exorbitant rate of something like,49
NA,$100 an hour in order to provide the cover'.,49
NA,Austrade does not have a good record. One,49
NA,would hope that it can do better under its new,49
NA,management. But it is certainly important that,49
NA,"Austrade, EFlC, under its new corporate label,",49
NA,and government departmental officers link to,49
NA,provide a better service to those who need to,49
NA,be encouraged to export.,49
NA,Australia has a great capacity to compete.,49
NA,We have a wonderful work force. In spite of,49
NA,"all of our industrial difficulties, in my view",49
NA,we can produce the quality and the range of,49
NA,goods. We can provide the service. We can,49
NA,also provide what the customer wants. But,49
NA,this cannot be done on just an occasional visit,49
NA,to an overseas country. It is done by consis-,49
NA,"tently attacking a particular market, identify-",49
NA,"ing and working with the customer and, to the",49
NA,"maximum, coordinating efforts between the",49
NA,departmental agencies that provide the ser-,49
NA,vice.,49
NA,"EFIC has done that, although it has had its",49
NA,ups and downs over the years. One would,49
NA,hope that in its new corporate form it can,49
NA,meet that export demand to a greater degree.,49
NA,But it should not forgo its traditional role in,49
NA,regard to commodities which perhaps today,49
NA,"require greater access than they ever have,",49
NA,bearing in mind the variation of commercial,49
NA,restraints in the form of tariff and non-tariff,49
NA,barriers that apply in so many of our markets.,49
NA,"By all means, let EFIC extend, where it can,",49
NA,its activities into the field of processed goods.,49
NA,But let it also direct a lot of its attention to,49
NA,small business where there is a requirement,49
NA,and where there is an opportunity.,49
Mr FREE ,Lindsay-Minister for Science,49
NA,and Technology and Minister Assisting the,49
NA,"Treasurer) (5.03 p.m.)-in reply-First of all,",49
NA,I thank the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr,49
NA,"Downer), the honourable member for",49
NA,Macarthur ( Mr Martin) and the right honour-,49
NA,able member for New England ( Mr Sinclair),49
NA,for their contributions during this debate. I,49
NA,welcome particularly the expression by the,49
NA,honourable member for Mayo of the,49
NA,Opposition's support for the Export Finance,49
NA,and Insurance Corporation Bill and the Export,49
NA,Finance and Insurance Corporation (Transi-,49
NA,tional Provisions and Consequential Amend-,49
NA,ments) Bill. I think that is a recognition of the,49
NA,important role that EFIC has to play.,49
NA,I would like to deal briefly with some of,49
NA,the specific issues raised during the debate.,49
NA,The honourable member for Mayo expressed,49
NA,some concern about the decision taken to,49
NA,retain EFIC within the Department of Indus-,49
NA,"try, Technology and Commerce. I guess there",49
NA,"are two issues here: first of all, the relation-",49
NA,"ship between EFIC and the Department; and,",49
NA,"secondly, the question of its separation from",49
NA,Austrade. The decision to move Austrade to,49
NA,the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio was,49
NA,taken to achieve a closer integration of our,49
NA,trade promotion activities within the,50
NA,Australian overseas diplomatic network.,50
NA,"EFIC, on the other hand, provides insurance",50
NA,guarantees and lpans in support of the export,50
NA,of goods and services from all industry,50
NA,"sectors, namely, commodities, manufactures",50
NA,"and services. I should point out, however, that",50
NA,the majority of its support in terms of individ-,50
NA,ual transactions relates to manufactured,50
NA,"exports which fall, of course, within the scope",50
NA,"of the industry portfolio. Also, the financing",50
NA,of capital projects overseas has become an,50
NA,increasingly important aspect of EFIC's busi-,50
NA,"ness. Unlike Austrade, the provision of",50
NA,EFIC's services is not reliant on a presence in,50
NA,foreign countries-a point which seems to,50
NA,have escaped some speakers during this,50
NA,debate.,50
NA,Any concern about the separation of EFIC,50
NA,and Austrade and their location in different,50
NA,portfolios is also a little misplaced. They will,50
NA,continue to work closely together to maximise,50
NA,the prospects of success for Australian export-,50
NA,ers and this will be reinforced in a structural,50
NA,sense by the cross-representation of each of,50
NA,the managing directors on the boards of EFIC,50
NA,and Austrade.,50
NA,I was pleased to hear that the shadow,50
NA,Minister had largely rejected the idea of,50
NA,privatisation. That question has been exam-,50
NA,ined on a number of occasions but was found,50
NA,to be impractical. The shadow Minister,50
NA,referred to the environment in the United,50
NA,Kingdom. The changes there were largely,50
NA,driven by the prospect of integration into,50
NA,Europe in 1992 where it will be essential for,50
NA,"credit insurers, if they are able to compete, to",50
NA,be in a position to insure both offshore and,50
NA,"domestic business. Of course, that situation is",50
NA,not faced by Australia.,50
NA,The honourable member for Mayo raised a,50
NA,number of questions concerning EFIC's losses,50
NA,in shipbuilding. He asked for a response on,50
NA,the total value of losses and non-performing,50
NA,loans held by EFIC. I am informed that there,50
NA,"have been some losses in shipbuilding, but",50
NA,nothing like the $110m suggested by the,50
NA,honourable member.,50
NA,I make two general points. These matters of,50
NA,"detail should be properly addressed, as the",50
NA,"honourable member for Mayo well knows,",50
NA,through the devices of placing questions on,50
NA,notice or pursuing them through Senate,50
NA,"Estimates committees. Also, of course, as I",50
NA,"am anxious to assist him further, figures on",50
NA,total claims and recoveries are set out in,50
NA,EFIC's annual reports.,50
NA,The proposal of the honourable member for,50
NA,Mayo for a joint working group to examine,50
NA,the possibility of contracting business out to,50
NA,the commercial banking sector is an interest-,50
NA,"ing one. In response, I should point out to",50
NA,him that that option is available now. Experi-,50
NA,"ence has shown that, of course, it is more",50
NA,expensive because banks require a margin,50
NA,over and above the interest subsidy provided.,50
NA,I have been able to obtain no information to,50
NA,assist hiql on his claims that EFIC may have,50
NA,been reiponsible for delays which have cost,50
NA,exporters contracts. There is no evidence,50
NA,available to me at this stage about such,50
NA,"delays. If he has such evidence, again I know",50
NA,that that would be welcome. It would be,50
NA,"offered in a sense of constructive criticism,",50
NA,for which the honourable member for Mayo,50
NA,is so well known.,50
NA,I have additional comments concerning the,50
NA,remarks of the honourable member for,50
NA,Macarthur. I take on board what he had to say,50
NA,about the need for representation in the,50
NA,"American mid-west but, more particularly, I",50
NA,endorse his remarks about the need that we,50
NA,have to export finished products. It underlines,50
NA,the importance and the correctness of the,50
NA,Government's decision to retain EFIC in the,50
NA,industry portfolio.,50
NA,I also thank the right honourable member,50
NA,for New England ( Mr Sinclair) for his contri-,50
NA,bution and for his reference to the role in,50
NA,previous years of the Primary Industry Bank,50
NA,and the Reserve Bank. In the current environ-,50
NA,"ment, EFIC provides a great deal more than",50
NA,assistance for commodity exporters. Increas-,50
NA,"ingly, the direction for the future, while not",50
NA,"neglecting the primary industry sector, will be",50
NA,to provide what additional support can be,50
NA,provided to aid growth in manufactured,50
NA,"exports. Of course, the skills required in that",50
NA,kind of field are much more highly special-,50
NA,ised than those that are available in the,50
NA,"Reserve Bank. As I mentioned earlier, the",50
NA,prospect of EFIC having a post in every port,50
NA,overseas really does not arise because EPIC,51
NA,does not have or need overseas posts.,51
NA,"Almost finally, I am assured that consulta-",51
NA,tion has occurred regularly and will continue,51
NA,to occur between the banks and the insurance,51
NA,industry. I am assured that they are fully,51
NA,supportive of the continuing importance and,51
NA,role of EPIC. I am also advised that the,51
NA,reporting process will be a full and a frank,51
NA,one.,51
NA,"Finally, in response to the criticism during",51
NA,the debate about a number of Ministers,51
NA,having an futerest in the trade area-including,51
NA,"the Minister for Industry, Technology and",51
NA,"Commerce (Senator Button), the -inister for",51
NA,Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Crean),51
NA,and the Minister for Trade and Overseas,51
NA,Development (Dr Blewett)-I would rather,51
NA,take it as evidence of the importance that the,51
NA,Government attaches to trade promotion that,51
NA,a number of senior Ministers should be,51
NA,"involved, because there are many aspects to",51
NA,the important question of improving our trade,51
NA,"performance. I guess that, if we were here in",51
NA,another time and there were simply one,51
NA,"Minister responsible for trade, then an opposiInterestingly,",51
NA,tion of another time might equally be criticisthere,51
NA,ing a government for having only one Minis-,51
NA,ter involved in such an important area. I,51

Mr SMITH ,"Bass)(5.13 p.m.)-This Bill,",51
NA,"being an amendment to the Broadcasting Act,",51
NA,comes at a very difficult time for the,51
NA,Government. I will relate some of the high,51
NA,drama that took place this morning later on,51
NA,"during my remarks. In any event, this Bill is",51
NA,one of a series made to the Broadcasting Act,51
NA,which now marks it as probably the most,51
NA,complicated piece of legislation in this,51
NA,country. There would be very few who would,51
NA,understand fully its reach or its ramifications.,51
NA,at the time of the last election,51
NA,were considerable moves and comments,51
NA,made by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) to,51
NA,thank have this piece of legislation subject to,51
NA,review-to have a rewrite. We are still wait-,51
NA,ing to see that take place.,51
NA,This Bill clearly demonstrates yet again a,51
NA,need for an urgent overview of the broadcast-,51
NA,ing legislation. It would be hoped that the,51
NA,"sooner that is undertaken by the Government,",51
NA,the sooner: we might get to a very sensible,51
NA,position in broadcasting in this country. This,51
NA,Bill demonstrates so clearly the total confu-,51
NA,sion that is afoot within the Government.,51
NA,"Indeed, it is causing great confusion within",51
NA,the industry.,51
NA,This Bill comes at a time of great signifi-,51
NA,cance in that the Fairfax assets that are now,51
NA,held by a receiver effectively-being the,51
NA,second and third most profitable newspapers,51
NA,"in the world, not just in the country-that is,",51
NA,"the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the",51
NA,"other newspapers that are in that group,",51
NA,notably the Australian Financial Review and,51
NA,"otherS, are about to be sold and bidders are",51
NA,"asked to come to the receiver, I believe on 15",51
NA,"October, next Tuesday, to put their bids on",52
NA,the table.,52
NA,What this Bill seeks to do is largely as a,52
NA,result of the proposed sale of those interests,52
NA,"formerly held by the Fairfax group, which",52
NA,"went into receivership, as so many of us",52
NA,"know, because of the aborted privatisation of",52
NA,that group by the inheritor of the Fairfax,52
NA,"dynasty, Mr Warwick Fairfax.",52
NA,The Commonwealth has no direct power,52
NA,"over newspapers. However, cross-media",52
NA,ownership rules limit an owner with a pre-,52
NA,scribed interest in a commercial television,52
NA,licence to under 15 per cent ownership of a,52
NA,newspaper which is associated with a service,52
NA,area of the television licence or where the,52
NA,owner is in a position to control more than 15,52
NA,per cent of votes at a general meeting.,52
NA,The Bill requires people who propose to,52
NA,acquire an interest that is controlled under the,52
NA,Broadcasting Act in relation to cross-media,52
NA,ownership and foreign control rules to notify,52
NA,the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal of their,52
NA,intention. This prior notification will act as a,52
NA,trigger and is a less formal inquiry system,52
NA,than a full pre-vetting investigation.,52
NA,Before going into some of the more detailed,52
NA,"aspects of the legislation, I think it is import-",52
NA,ant to note that what the Bill does in effect is,52
NA,to create even more regulation in this area. It,52
NA,is not something that we welcome. In the,52
NA,broad we reject it as not being in the best,52
NA,interests of the smooth administration of the,52
NA,Commonwealth's law in this area. It has,52
NA,created a great deal of confusion in the impact,52
NA,it will have in the technical application of its,52
NA,"provisions. There is a great deal of concern,",52
NA,"which I will refer to later, as to whether or",52
NA,not the legislation will actually achieve the,52
NA,greater scrutiny of the public interest tests that,52
NA,it purports to put in place.,52
NA,"To understand this legislation, one has to go",52
NA,back a little while and look at what the,52
NA,administrator of the cross-media ownership,52
NA,rules and the foreign control elements of the,52
NA,Broadcasting Act had to say about it. The,52
NA,"administrator is a separate tribunal, the",52
NA,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In a very,52
NA,"significant press release of 19 July 1991, the",52
NA,"then Acting Chairman, now Chairman, Mr",52
NA,Westerway-I might add that he is probably,52
NA,one of those few people in the country who,52
NA,understands the whole range and reach of the,52
NA,"Broadcasting Act, having been a senior",52
NA,member of the bureaucracy in the department,52
NA,administering this area for a number of,52
NA,years-detailed all the communications he,52
NA,had had with the Government. He set out his,52
NA,concerns about the activities of proponents for,52
NA,purchase of media assets and how the reach,52
NA,of the ABT was in part frustrated.,52
NA,In a letter to the Minister for Transport and,52
NA,Communications ( Mr Beazley) some consider-,52
NA,"able time ago, Mr Westerway had pointed out",52
NA,that the processes involved a broad consider-,52
NA,ation of many issues relating to media owner-,52
NA,"ship, including a particular case referred to as",52
NA,"the Kimshaw 2UE transaction, as well as the",52
NA,licence renewal inquiries for the Seven and,52
NA,"Ten networks. In his letter to the Minister, he",52
NA,covered three main points and pointed out the,52
NA,deficiencies in the law. He said that there,52
NA,were deficiencies related to the process of,52
NA,"approving share transactions, both the notifi-",52
NA,cations of transactions and deemed control,52
NA,"provisions. Secondly, he said that the sanc-",52
NA,tions were often inappropriate or ineffective,52
NA,and that there was a need to focus on sanc-,52
NA,tions relevant to the breach rather than ap-,52
NA,proach them through the licensing process.,52
NA,"Thirdly, he: pointed out that the current infor-",52
NA,mal arrangements for cooperation between the,52
NA,Trade Practices Commission and the ABT,52
NA,needed strengthening and he recommended,52
NA,"cross-membership-which, I add in passing,",52
NA,I thought was a commendable initiative. In,52
NA,"fact, under this legislation there is sharing of",52
NA,information not only with the TPC but also,52
NA,"with the FIRB, a matter which I will come to",52
NA,later.,52
NA,He then detailed a long series of flagging,52
NA,his concern with the Minister and came to the,52
NA,"nub of the issue, which was the release on 18",52
NA,June 1991 of the ABT decision on the appli-,52
NA,cation by Kimshaw Pty Ltd to acquire control,52
NA,of a Sydney radio station 2UE. Kimshaw is,52
NA,the name of a company which is effectively,52
NA,a shelf company; it held the interests on,52
NA,behalf of someone else-and the someone,52
NA,NA,52
NA,read into Hansard what the ABT said in its,52
NA,decision because it is the basis from which,53
NA,this legislation springs:,53
NA,The ownership structure of Kimshaw was devised,53
NA,to serve one purpose: to preclude a breach of the,53
NA,ownership and control provisions of the Broadcast-,53
NA,ing Act without affecting the actual ownership of,53
NA,interests in the 2UE licence.,53
NA,"In the event that such structures are employed,",53
NA,"there appears to be no quick, cheap way of testing",53
NA,for actual control. This may be an area for con-,53
NA,sideration in any review of broadcasting legislation.,53
NA,Some form of prior provisional clearance . . .,53
NA,might be used to prevent the architects of avoid-,53
NA,ance schemes from enjoying their benefits for,53
NA,months or years until the Tribunal is in a position,53
NA,to conclude its inquiries into them.,53
NA,"What it is saying there is that the Act, in",53
NA,"effect, is not working and is not addressing",53
NA,the mischief that was outlined in the Kimshaw,53
NA,case in particular. Mr Westerway had been,53
NA,saying this for some considerable time and the,53
NA,Government had taken no action. Finally it,53
NA,"came to the Parliament with this Bill. But,",53
NA,"interestingly, the ABT was arguing for more",53
NA,than what this Bill gives. It was arguing for,53
NA,a mandatory prenotification procedure. This,53
NA,Bill puts in place a voluntary prenotification,53
NA,procedure-for want of a better term-which,53
NA,has to be complied with by companies that,53
NA,might be acquiring interests. It also broadens,53
NA,the requirement to incorporate associates.,53
NA,"Associates are defined as individuals, in the",53
NA,"same terms as the income tax Act, who may",53
NA,have a personal interest in or a pre-existing,53
NA,interest in a proponent for acquisition and,53
NA,someone who might contravene the cross-,53
NA,media ownership rules. If someone is in a,53
NA,"position to know that he may contravene, or",53
NA,have an association with someone who may,53
NA,"contravene, he is required to notify.",53
NA,"At the time, I pointed out in a press release",53
NA,that the Minister was of a slightly different,53
NA,view. Back in August at the National Press,53
NA,Club he said in his address that he would,53
NA,consider whether the ABT needed a trip-wire,53
NA,inserted in the Broadcasting Act which would,53
NA,be a list of situations which would lead to,53
NA,possible breaches of ownership and control,53
NA,laws through the use of people or companies,53
NA,as associates. Yet on 27 August he said that,53
NA,he would not push to give the ABT that,53
NA,power.,53
NA,"On 29 August, the retiring Chairman of the",53
NA,"TPC, Professor Baxt, said that the Minister's",53
NA,latest comments left him with 'concern about,53
NA,whether the Government is providing the,53
NA,ABT with the necessary power to evaluate all,53
NA,the bids'. Then on 3 September there was yet,53
NA,another report about a new view being pro-,53
NA,posed by the Minister to the Cabinet. I asked,53
NA,the question then and I still have to ask the,53
NA,question after the events of today: what,53
NA,exactly is the Minister's view and what,53
NA,exactly is the Government's view? There is a,53
NA,great deal of confusion.,53
NA,Then the Government came to the,53
NA,"Parliament with this Bill, which did not meet",53
NA,the ABT's advice. I have to say that I do not,53
NA,agree with the full advice of the ABT. I think,53
NA,a full mandatory prenotification procedure,53
NA,would not be of assistance to the development,53
NA,of this industry. This is a halfway house. It,53
NA,goes halfway to meeting those concerns and,53
NA,"tries to balance off the public interest, that is,",53
NA,maintaining the integrity of the cross-media,53
NA,ownership rules but at the same time allowing,53
NA,for there to be a reasonable operation of the,53
NA,marketplace in terms of commerciality re-,53
NA,quirements.,53
NA,So that is what the legislation tries to do.,53
NA,. The view that we take about this matter is,53
NA,"that, if one accepts that there should be cross-",53
NA,"media ownership rules, which are designed in",53
NA,this country to limit concentration to try to,53
NA,underpin the principle of diversity in the,53
NA,"media industry, one would have to say that,",53
NA,where one has been advised by one's regula-,53
NA,tor that there is a mischief that has to be,53
NA,addressed-and this is a proposal that has,53
NA,been put forward-anything that tries to go,53
NA,down that path to address that concetn in the,53
NA,broad principle probably should be supported.,53
NA,In that sense we will allow the legislation to,53
NA,"pass. However, I have to say that I do not",53
NA,preclude the possibility of possible amend-,53
NA,"ments being dealt with in the Senate, should",53
NA,they come forward after further study of this,53
NA,matter given the somewhat confusing and,53
NA,contrary views that are put about the reach of,53
NA,some Of the sections. I also add that that,53
NA,matter is further clouded by virtue of the fact,53
NA,that only today have the Australian Democrats,54
NA,announced who their spokespersons are. As,54
NA,"far as I can see from the list, they have",54
NA,changed their spolcesperson in this area and it,54
NA,"is now Senator Powell, the former Leader of",54
NA,the Australian Democrats. So that matter,54
NA,remains to be dealt with. But on this occasion,54
NA,we flag our deep concern about the confusing,54
NA,aspects of much of this legislation.,54
NA,"Effectively, these amendments put in place",54
NA,a prior provisional clearance. So someone,54
NA,"who wants to acquire an asset, or that",54
NA,"someone's associate, can say to the ABT,",54
NA,'This is what we are intending to do. If you,54
NA,think it will contravene the cross-media,54
NA,ownership nIles or the foreign control matters,54
NA,"that are in the Act, you should hear what we",54
NA,have to say'. If the ABT is concerned that a,54
NA,"proposed transaction will breach those rules,",54
NA,under this Bill it has the right to go to the,54
NA,Federal Court and seek an interim order or an,54
NA,injunction accordingly to forestall the transac-,54
NA,tion or to provide it with sufficient time to,54
NA,address the matter. It is provided with only 10,54
NA,days to gather this information and to become,54
NA,aware. Many would argue-and I would be,54
NA,one of those-that in the circumstances 10,54
NA,days might be somewhat short. It seems to be,54
NA,a period that has been arbitrarily put into the,54
NA,"Bill. In the United States, I understand, it is",54
NA,"21 days, and under the Trade Practices Act",54
NA,the period is longer as well. So there may be,54
NA,an argument that can be dealt with later in the,54
NA,Senate about whether or not that period ought,54
NA,to be extended.,54
NA,The question is: do the changes to the,54
NA,"Tribunal's powers, as proposed by the Minis-",54
NA,"ter, address the mischief that Kimshaw and",54
NA,the renewal of Channel 7 and Channel 10,54
NA,showed us existed? There is some doubt about,54
NA,"that. That is the issue of deep concern to us,",54
NA,because if this proposed change is nothing,54
NA,more than a facade to address the concerns in,54
NA,the broader community about the prospect of,54
NA,"the change in the ownership of Fairfax, one",54
NA,"would have to say that, although the second",54
NA,reading speech of the Minister and some,54
NA,sections of the legislation contemplate ad-,54
NA,"dressing the mischief, really the Bill is only",54
NA,dressing up the matter.,54
NA,I will indicate some of the concerns which,54
NA,"have been expressed. On Wednesday, 18",54
NA,September there was an article in the business,54
NA,section of the Australian by a well-respected,54
NA,"commentator of long standing, Bryan Frith.",54
NA,"The headline reads, 'Government's moves on",54
NA,Fairfax bids are just for show'. This headline,54
NA,and the long article under it relate to a matter,54
NA,which has to be addressed by the Govern-,54
NA,ment. The article reads:,54
NA,A move designed to make the bidding easier for the,54
NA,"foreign syndicates, coupled with action which",54
NA,"might hinder the Packer-Black syndicate, could be",54
NA,seen as a shrewd method of favouring the 0 'Reilly,54
NA,syndicate... In practice the derisory lO-day period,54
NA,provided would mean that the ABT would be,54
NA,unable to collect evidence to the degree of sophisti-,54
NA,cation required to convince the court of associations,54
NA,which result in a breach of the cross-ownership,54
NA,limits.,54
NA,That issue remains to be answered. In evi-,54
NA,"dence to the print media inquiry last week, a",54
NA,range of concerns were raised about this,54
NA,matter. I think these need to be answered.,54
NA,I must point out-and I will be concise,54
NA,about it-that it is the Opposition's view that,54
NA,this process should be as transparent .as,54
NA,possible. I have heard Government members,54
NA,"say this as well, and I welcome hearing it. It",54
NA,is most important that there be no possibility,54
NA,of any arguments or special deals that could,54
NA,be entered into by any of the proposed bid-,54
NA,ders. All bidders must be able to be dealt with,54
NA,openly. One would hope that that is the case.,54
NA,"The Minister has said that, but when we read",54
NA,articles such as the one from which I have,54
NA,quoted and we hear comments put on the,54
NA,"public record that raise the contrary view, it",54
NA,is incumbent on the Government and its,54
NA,spokesmen to answer those charges.,54
NA,some concern also has been raised about the,54
NA,foreign investment levels that would be,54
NA,acceptable to the Government under the bid.,54
NA,Honourable members would have heard that,54
NA,the 20 per cent figure has been subject to,54
NA,great debate. Several weeks ago the,54
NA,"Government announced that the 20 per cent,",54
NA,"on its strict interpretation, was to be varied.",54
NA,A Caucus meeting indicated that the 20 per,54
NA,cent was to be varied to allow additional,54
NA,foreign equity to be engaged in support of,54
NA,"bids, and that it carried with it a non-voting",54
NA,element. The question of whether or not one,55
NA,can structure a bid to meet that requirement,55
NA,also remains to be answered. Many people,55
NA,raised doubts about that in giving evidence to,55
NA,the print media inquiry last week. That issue,55
NA,is presently causing concern for Caucus.,55
NA,We understand from the AAP report that,55
NA,this morning Caucus took that matter back for,55
NA,consideration. The vote was taken about,55
NA,whether or not there ought to be a strict,55
NA,interpretation of the 20 per cent as it relates,55
NA,"to newspaper investments-and, of course, it",55
NA,impacts on the bids. I reiterate that these bids,55
NA,have to be on the table next Tuesday. In a,55
NA,"remarkable result, the Left and the Centre",55
NA,"Left combined to have 42 votes, and the",55
NA,Right had 41 votes. The Left and the Centre,55
NA,Left were supporting a strict 20 per cent,55
NA,interpretation. A Minister-and I do not know,55
NA,which one; I understand that the Minister for,55
NA,Transport and Communications has lost his,55
NA,"voice, so I assume it was not him-moved",55
NA,that the matter should be suspended because,55
NA,standing orders were offended. She needed an,55
NA,absolute majority to have a motion such as,55
NA,this passed. Then Senator Mcmullan moved,55
NA,that there be a special Caucus meeting on,55
NA,Thursday to consider the matter. In the inter-,55
NA,"im, the transport and communications back-",55
NA,bench committee and the economic backbench,55
NA,committee would meet on Wednesday night,55
NA,to prepare a report for Thursday's meeting. So,55
NA,I think it would be fair from any objective ob-,55
NA,server's point of view to say that there is a,55
NA,great deal of confusion over the Government's,55
NA,position.,55
NA,"I can only say that, if people are in the",55
NA,"marketplace, wanting to bid and wanting to",55
NA,"know what the rules of the gam- are, and",55
NA,they see that being debated in the Parliament,55
NA,today is an Act to change the Broadcasting,55
NA,Act while at the same time there is confusion,55
NA,about the limits of foreign ownership with,55
NA,"regard to the newspaper industry, they would",55
NA,have to be very confused and disturbed about,55
NA,the ability of the Government to provide some,55
NA,clear rules.,55
NA,"It is most important in this whole process,",55
NA,when the pre-eminent media assets in this,55
NA,"country are for sale, that we note the level of",55
NA,confusion and the changing of the rules taking,55
NA,place at the same time. That must give great,55
NA,cause for concern. The Broadcasting Bill,55
NA,compounds the problem. One has to be,55
NA,"careful because, in dealing with the bids, they",55
NA,are all talking their own book-and we would,55
NA,expect them to do so-and so one will not,55
NA,necessarily embrace one set of issues over,55
NA,another. The Opposition thinks the market-,55
NA,"place ought to make this judgment, but it",55
NA,ought to be making it in the certainty of what,55
NA,the rules are. If this matter now is uncertain-,55
NA,as it clearly isI think it requires urgent,55
NA,explanation.,55
NA,The amazing thing is that all of this is,55
NA,happening in one week. We have this Bill,55
NA,"before us now, and at the beginning of my",55
NA,remarks I said that the ABT had been point-,55
NA,ing out problems in the administration of the,55
NA,Act. This is virtually the first piece of legisla-,55
NA,tion to be dealt with today. The Caucus,55
NA,"meeting was held this morning, and no deci-",55
NA,sion could be made. There was a clear split.,55
NA,That runs in tandem with the problems that,55
NA,the Government is experiencing with its,55
NA,policy on interest rates.,55
NA,Last week we had a full week of the print,55
NA,"media inquiry, which sawall the bidders",55
NA,come before it to put their cases. One witness,55
NA,even went in camera to give evidence to us.,55
NA,n would be broad knowledge now that much,55
NA,of the matter he raised related to concerns,55
NA,"about this particular Bill. If that is the case,",55
NA,I tlUnk we have reached a fairly sorry state,55
NA,with the Government. Tonight the Select,55
NA,"Committee on the Print Media meets again,",55
NA,under the. chairmanship of the honourable,55
NA,member for Dobell ( Mr Lee)-an able chair-,55
NA,man who has exhibited a great deal of for-,55
NA,bearance and is conducting the inquiry as well,55
NA,"as could be expected in the circumstances,",55
NA,considering the pressure and the enormity of,55
NA,the issues which he is charged to administer.,55
NA,But tonight we deal with further matters. I see,55
NA,that on the agenda there are further questions,55
NA,that Government members want to ask a,55
NA,particular bidder. Those questions certainly,55
NA,"raise again the impact of this Bill and, more",55
NA,"particularly, the non-decision of the Caucus",55
NA,meeting this morning.,55
NA,I do not know how the Government is,55
NA,"going to respond to this, but certainly by the",55
NA,time this Bill gets to the Senate we could be,56
NA,dealing with a slightly different situation. I,56
NA,therefore reserve the position of the Opposi-,56
NA,tion in that we might well deal with further,56
NA,"amendments, given that the Australian Demo-",56
NA,crats have yet to formally take up their posi-,56
NA,tions in their shadow Ministry. There are,56
NA,some amendments that the Government itself,56
NA,"is proposing, with which, as I have indicated",56
NA,to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister,56
NA,for Transport and Communications ( Mr,56
NA,"Snowdon), who is at the table, we have no",56
NA,"difficulty, at least at this point, because they",56
NA,deal with a technical matter. But there are,56
NA,"several other matters, and perhaps I ought to",56
NA,refer to some of those which I think are of,56
NA,concern.,56
NA,The suggestion is that section 89K(l)(a),56
NA,might be able to be integrated with other,56
NA,tracing rules so that the control of a company,56
NA,will be treated as control of the operations,56
NA,its subsidiaries and control tmder section,56
NA,89K(1)(a) can be imputed back through,56
NA,porate structures to the ultimate owner.,56
NA,are also matters regarding the revision of,56
NA,"language of section 89K(1)(a), such as 'in",56
NA,position to exercise control'. The whole,56
NA,"of the ABT is: where does actual control lie,",56
NA,whether or not that position to exercise,56
NA,control includes potential control as well as,56
NA,"present control? Of course, it is extremely",56
NA,important that the potential control question community.,56
NA,"is able to be picked up as well. Of course, we",56
NA,should include 'de facto' control in section,56
NA,89K(1)(a) and require notification for those,56
NA,who acquire less than a prescribed interest,56
NA,and whose associates do not acquire any,56
NA,shareholding or voting interest. The extension,56
NA,of the notification requirement is so that prior,56
NA,notification is required if a person with a,56
NA,prescribed interest in a television licence has,56
NA,any interest in a proposed acquisition of,56
NA,"newspaper, disregarding nominal shareholdmarketplace",56
NA,"ings in listed companies, and so that full",56
NA,details of all circumstances surrounding that,56
NA,interest must be disclosed.,56
NA,We also need to be looking more closely,56
NA,imputing the rights of associates to each,56
NA,not only for the purposes of notification,56
NA,transactions but also for the purposes,56
NA,"substantive rules, so that the difficulty",56
NA,proving breaches under the current rules is,56
NA,reduced. I Jnight say that I am advised by the,56
NA,"ABT that, with the prospect of this Bill",56
NA,"becoming law, members of either one or two",56
NA,of the consortia that are seeking to place a bid,56
NA,before the receiver have been to the ABT to,56
NA,disclose in the voluntary manner that is,56
NA,"required-that is, relying on the candour of",56
NA,the parties to put information before the ABT.,56
NA,So this proposed law may be having an effect.,56
NA,But I come back again to the argument that,56
NA,was put by Bryan Frith and others on the,56
NA,public record about whether or not this is a,56
NA,facade and whether or not the fears held by,56
NA,some that the provisions in this Bill can be,56
NA,got around is not a reality. I guess that is the,56
NA,"point: many are concerned that, if this is a",56
NA,"facade, they would want to have from the",56
NA,"Government a guarantee that, should the",56
NA,"matter manifest itself at some future time, it",56
NA,of would address that matter by way of legisla-,56
NA,tion or other manner immediately. If it did not,56
NA,"cordo so, we would have to question the bona",56
NA,There fides with which the Government comes to,56
NA,the the Parliament with this Bill. The gravity of,56
NA,"a that charge, I am sure, is not lost on the",56
NA,test Parliamentary Secretary at the table. But,56
NA,certainly the level of confusion and uncertain-,56
NA,ty in the Government's handling of this whole,56
NA,matter of the acquisition of the Fairfax assets,56
NA,ought to give pause to all in the business,56
NA,"This Bill, as I said, is undesirable. It is",56
NA,adding to the great confusion and mishmash.,56
NA,It makes the lawyers' picnic a grand affair,56
NA,because they are the only ones-and I am a,56
NA,lawyer-who are going to be able to sort this,56
NA,matter out. But what we want to see in this,56
NA,"matter is clarity of policy, certainty of policy",56
NA,and a clear understanding of that policy by all,56
NA,a potential players in the marketplace. The,56
NA,should determine who is going to,56
NA,be the owner of the Fairfax assets. It is not an,56
NA,easy issue for the receiver. It is not an easy,56
NA,issue for those who are seeking to put bids,56
NA,before the receiver. It is clearly a difficult,56
NA,at issue for the Government. But if the fund a-,56
NA,"other mental principles are adhered to-that is,",56
NA,of making sure existing law is well understood,56
NA,of and well supported-I think we are halfway,56
NA,of towards addressing the matter in a proper,56
NA,fashion and in a manner in which the,57
NA,Australian public would desire it to be ad-,57
NA,dressed.,57
NA,This is not the debate nor the time to,57
NA,"comments about the broader issues involved,",57
NA,but there is one other point that I would,57
NA,before resuming my seat. These matters,57
NA,cannot be dealt with in isolation for a contoday.,57
NA,sideration of the Trade Practices,57
NA,principles or the principles that underpin the,57
NA,Trade Practices Act. There is a current arguly,57
NA,ment taking place in the community about,57
NA,whether or not that Act ought to be changed.,57
NA,"It is a very significant argument, it is a very",57
NA,serious argument and it ought to be dealt,57
NA,"with-and it is being dealt with, in my view,",57
NA,properly-before the print media inquiry.,57
NA,it does have an impact on this matter.,57
NA,One of the important points that this Bill,57
NA,does bring forward is the talking about the,57
NA,sharing of information and the cross-,57
NA,"membership between the ABT, the TPC and,",57
NA,"indeed, the Foreign Investment Review Board.",57
NA,That would seem to me to be a very sensible,57
NA,proposal and one that I would certainly,57
NA,"welcome, because that would help to make",57
NA,sure that there is some certainty as to how,57
NA,these matters are addressed. I have not talked,57
NA,about the desirability or otherwise of the,57
NA,existing cross-media ownership regime. That,57
NA,is a debate for another time because this Bill,57
NA,does not affect that regime. But there are,57
NA,"concerns that are held by us and, I know,",57
NA,honourable members on the Government side.,57
NA,"The expert on media law over there, the",57
NA,"honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe),",57
NA,apparently has some concerns. I think he is,57
NA,misnamed as an expert. I can think of many,57
NA,on the other side who are far more expert,57
NA,than he. But certainly there are concerns things-,57
NA,about those issues. They will be dealt with in,57
NA,time.,57
NA,Let me reiterate again: the Opposition does,57
NA,not like this Bill. It is the Government's Bill.,57
NA,We are not going to try to go through and votes.,57
NA,change and make effective a piece of legisla-,57
NA,tion that on the face of it looks somewhat,57
NA,"defective. But we reserve our right, of course,",57
NA,to deal with the matter in the Senate. This,57
NA,matter is in a totally confused state. We are,57
NA,waiting until 15 October for the bids to,57
NA,placed. The Government still has not made a,57
NA,decision after the drama of this morning when,57
NA,there was a 42 to 41 vote on foreign owner-,57
NA,make ship limits-a most extraordinary situation.,57
NA,We have a print media inquiry and uncertain-,57
NA,make ty in the Caucus. No wonder Government,57
NA,members were so quiet at Question Time,57
NA,But all of those issues were certainly-,57
NA,Commission (TIme expired),57
Mr LEE ,Dobell) (5.42 p.m.)-It is certain-,57
NA,a pleasure to follow my friend the honour-,57
NA,able member for Bass ( Mr Smith) in this,57
NA,"debate on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill,",57
NA,and perhaps I can clear up a few ettors of fact,57
NA,which he has put to the House. Perhaps I,57
NA,could start:by dealing with the debate which,57
NA,But is taking place in the Government at the,57
NA,moment on what should be the appropriate,57
NA,limit on foreign investment in Australia's,57
NA,newspapers. I think the honourable member,57
NA,for Bass might have been accurate when he,57
NA,described what happened in this morning's,57
NA,"Caucus, but perhaps I could just correct an",57
NA,error he made when he built up a head of,57
NA,steam and suggested that the vote in the,57
NA,Caucus this morning of 42 to 41 was on a,57
NA,particular foreign investment limit.,57
NA,The vote this morning was whether there,57
NA,should be a suspension of standing orders to,57
NA,"allow that debate to take place and, for quite",57
NA,"a proper reason, the Caucus believes that later",57
NA,this week there will be meetings of several,57
NA,by Caucus committees which will allow a proper,57
NA,analysis and a thorough discussion of these,57
NA,issues before a final decision is made by the,57
NA,"Caucus. But, of course, just as the members",57
NA,of the Liberal Party of Australia in the party,57
NA,"room have debates on consumption taxes,",57
NA,cross-media ownership rules and other,57
NA,"Mr Smith-We never have votes, though.",57
Mr LEE,They have votes as well?,57
NA,"Mr Smith-No, we are not allowed to have",57
Mr LEE,They are not allowed to have,57
NA,votes; I am glad the honourable member for,57
NA,Bass has clarified that. They have lots of,57
NA,"discussions but, in the end, it is their Leader",57
NA,whose vote counts for more than all the other,57
NA,be members of the Opposition-which perhaps,57
NA,is something for which Mikhail Gorbachev,58
NA,would envy him.,58
NA,It is very clear that in the end it 'is up to the,58
NA,"Government, not the Labor Caucus or a group",58
NA,"of Labor backbenchers, to make a final",58
NA,decision as to what the Government's policy,58
NA,should be. I should advise the House that my,58
NA,position is that there shoul? be a 2- per cent,58
NA,limit on foreign control of Australtan news-,58
NA,"papers, and today I will not go into my",58
NA,reasons for believing that.,58
NA,There are other members of my Party who,58
NA,believe we should define a limit on influence,58
NA,or a limit on ownership. This is a very techni-,58
NA,cal matter and something which I know may,58
NA,be sorted out in the very near future. But the,58
NA,honourable member for Bass alleges that the,58
NA,"Government, by having this discussion, is",58
NA,creating confusion in the community. I ask,58
NA,the House to reflect on what would be the,58
NA,"case if this debate were not taking place, if",58
NA,the Labor Caucus were not suggesting to the,58
NA,Government that we should set a very strict,58
NA,limit of 20 per cent for foreign investment in,58
NA,newspapers.,58
NA,What would be the position if the Govern-,58
NA,ment did not take a strong position? The,58
NA,Government would not be making a decision,58
NA,on whether a particular bid should proceed or,58
NA,"not, because of the amount of foreign invest-",58
NA,"ment involved, until the receiver chose the",58
NA,successful bidder. The Government would not,58
NA,be seeking information from the Foreign,58
NA,Investment Review Board to make a final,58
NA,"decision until the receiver, Mr Nichol, chose",58
NA,one of the three bidders. Then I assume that,58
NA,the Government would consider the advice,58
NA,from the Foreign Investment Review Board,58
NA,"and then the Treasurer ( Mr Kerin), after",58
NA,"perhaps a discussion in the Cabinet, would",58
NA,make the final decision.,58
NA,That would be the case if the Government,58
NA,did not set a very firm limit on foreign invest-,58
NA,ment in newspapers. No decision would -e,58
NA,made by the Government until Mr Nichol,58
NA,"made a final decision, the Foreign Investment",58
NA,Review Board made a decision and the,58
NA,Cabinet made a decision. It would be months,58
NA,and months before the successful bidder,58
NA,would know for sure whether it would be able,58
NA,"to proceed. That is the Opposition's position,",58
NA,if I understand what the honourable member,58
NA,for Bass has been saying at some of our,58
NA,hearings. He has argued that the Government,58
NA,should make a decision on a case by case,58
NA,basis as to whether a particular level of,58
NA,foreign investment should be allowed in a bid,58
NA,"for a newspaper, a radio station or a television",58
NA,station-,58
NA,Mr Elliott-That creates more confusion.,58
Mr LEE,As the honourable member for,58
NA,"Parramatta interjects, that is a recipe for",58
NA,greater confusion than we have now. At least,58
NA,those of us in the Labor Caucus who believe,58
NA,that there should be a limit on overseas,58
NA,ownership in newspapers are trying to give,58
NA,some advice to the market so that people,58
NA,know how much foreign investment there,58
NA,"should be in the bids. By contrast, the Oppo-",58
NA,"sition is saying that it should not set a limit,",58
NA,that if a bidder wants to have 100 per cent,58
NA,foreign ownership then that should be a,58
NA,matter which is considered by the Govern-,58
NA,ment on a case by case basis. Surely that is a,58
NA,"recipe for greater cdnfusi0n, not less. The",58
NA,honourable member quoted Mr Bryan Frith as,58
NA,an expert adviser.,58
NA,Mr Smith-A commentator.,58
Mr LEE,"A commentator, someone who",58
NA,has labelled this legislation as a facade. Mr,58
NA,Frith believes that this legislation will not,58
NA,achieve anything. The honourable member for,58
NA,Bass has said that that is a factor which may,58
NA,"be alleged by some people. If, as the honour-",58
NA,"able member for Bass pointed out, it is a",58
NA,"facade, why is at least one of the bidders",58
NA,complying with the intent of the legislation,58
NA,before it passes through this Parliament? At,58
NA,the public hearings last week we had Mr,58
NA,Trevor Kennedy advise the Select Committee,58
NA,on the Print Media that he has already started,58
NA,negotiations with the Australian Broadcasting,58
NA,"Tribunal, in accordance with this proposed",58
NA,legislation. He is certainly not treating this,58
NA,legislation as a facade. He is certainly not,58
NA,following the advice given to him by the,58
NA,"expert commentator, Mr Frith. The legislation",58
NA,which those on this side of the House hope,58
NA,will be passed in the very near future will,58
NA,have a very strong impact on what happens,58
NA,with the bidders for Fairfax.,58
NA,I wish to make a few comments on the,59
NA,background to the legislation before the,59
NA,House. As the honourable member for Bass,59
NA,"pointed out, the cross-media ownership",59
NA,are a result of this Government's determinaconglomerates,59
NA,tion to try to ensure greater diversity in,59
NA,Australia's media. The honourable member,59
NA,"for Blaxland ( Mr Keating), the former Treas-",59
NA,"urer, can rightly claim authorship for the",59
NA,"cross-media ownership rules, rules which I",59
NA,think have made a contribution to ensuring,59
NA,that some of the multi-media conglomerates,59
NA,that we used to have in Australia have had to,59
NA,be restructured.,59
NA,"For someone living in Sydney before 1986,",59
NA,it was very difficult to get a point of view,59
NA,"which did not come from either the Fairfax,",59
NA,"News Ltd or Packer syndicates. For example,",59
NA,the Fairfax Group owned Channel 7 in price,59
NA,"Sydney, radio station 2GB through the",59
NA,"Macquarie operation, the Sydney Morning",59
NA,"Herald, the Sun and the Australian Financial",59
NA,"Review. News Ltd owned Channel 10, the",59
NA,"Australian, the Daily Telegraph and the Daily",59
NA,Mirror. Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press,59
NA,owned Channel 9 in Sydney and very exten-,59
NA,sive magazine interests.,59
NA,"In Melbourne, your constituents, Mr Deputy",59
NA,"Speaker, before 1986 had the same domina-",59
NA,tion by News Ltd and Kerry Packer.,59
NA,Herald and Weekly Times conglomerate Christopher,59
NA,"owned Channel 7, radio station 3DB, the Sun",59
NA,Pictorial and the Melbourne Herald. Again,59
NA,we have three multi-media conglomerates,59
NA,occupying very strategic positions.,59
NA,What is the position today? In Sydney we,59
NA,"have different owners for channels 10, 7",59
NA,"9, not to mention the ABC and SBS. We have",59
NA,organisations such as Hoyts and other radio,59
NA,corporations which have decided to put,59
NA,syndicates together in the radio industry.,59
NA,"course, we have News Ltd and Fairfax domithis",59
NA,"nating newspapers, which was the case before",59
NA,1986.,59
NA,I admit that there are some people who,59
NA,believe that News Ltd has too high an ownerbeen,59
NA,ship of newspapers in Australia. That is,59
NA,of the crucial issues which the print media,59
NA,inquiry will address. Honourable members,59
NA,would not expect me to indicate here what,59
NA,"views might be on those issues, which",59
NA,addressed in our report. I think it is very,59
NA,"important, however, that we at least acknow-",59
NA,ledge the fact that the cross-media ownership,59
NA,rules rules have meant that those multi-media,59
NA,have been broken up.,59
NA,"Yes, it did not go well for Fairfax. It did",59
NA,not go well for young Warwick-I am not,59
NA,referring to the honourable member for Bass,59
NA,opposite-Fairfax in his attempt to privatise,59
NA,the John Fairfax Group. But I am not sure the,59
NA,Labor Government can be blamed for the fact,59
NA,that Mr Fairfax bid a silly price at a silly time,59
NA,"for the Fairfax Group, just as the Federal",59
NA,Government cannot be blamed for the fact,59
NA,"that Alan Bond, Frank Lowy and Christopher",59
NA,Skase bid silly prices at the wrong time for,59
NA,"the television networks, or for the fact that",59
NA,some radio station operators bid too high a,59
NA,for FM licences in the recent auctions.,59
NA,It is pretty hard to argue-as the Opposition,59
NA,does-that there should be more market,59
NA,"forces, that we should let the market reign",59
NA,supreme. But then when entrepreneurs in the,59
NA,market make silly decisions it is a bit silly to,59
NA,say that they should not bear the conse-,59
NA,quences of their decisions.,59
NA,Mr Smith-Bring Christopher Skase back.,59
Mr LEE,That is what has happened. The,59
NA,The honourable member for Bass says that,59
NA,Skase should be brought back; I,59
NA,agree completely. I believe Mr Skase should,59
NA,be forced to return to Australia to answer the,59
NA,charges that are pending against him in a,59
NA,number of areas. I was very interested to read,59
NA,of his activities in Spain these days. I think,59
NA,and his time could be more productively spent,59
NA,here in Australia answering a few questions,59
NA,rather than gardening in his villa in Majorca.,59
NA,Having given the Government credit for,59
NA,"Of introducing the cross-media ownership rules,",59
NA,is one point where I can compliment the,59
NA,honourable member for Bass. In one recent,59
NA,article it was said that one of his great,59
NA,achievements to date has been that he has,59
NA,able to persuade the Opposition to,59
NA,one support the cross-media ownership rules.,59
NA,Given the fact that the past history of the,59
NA,Opposition's position on this has been,59
NA,"my complex, to say the least, I think that is a",59
NA,will be credit to the honourable member.,59
NA,If we go back through Hansard reports in,60
NA,the period that covered the debate on the,60
NA,introduction of the cross-media ownership,60
NA,"rules, we find that the Liberal Party argued",60
NA,that it should be the Trade Practices,60
NA,"Commission, and not the ABT, that should be",60
NA,"involved in this. The National Party, through",60
NA,"Charles Blunt, the former member for",60
NA,"Richmond, and others argued that they were",60
NA,very concerned that the cross-media owner-,60
NA,ship rules could have a bad effect in rural,60
NA,areas. The honourable member for Bass,60
NA,deserves credit for the fact that the Opposition,60
NA,now looks like supporting the cross-media,60
NA,ownership rules and ensuring that they are,60
NA,obeyed in the spirit of the law as well as the,60
NA,"letter of the law, which is the position that the",60
NA,current Minister for Transport and Communi-,60
NA,cations ( Mr Beazley) has taken.,60
NA,What are those limits? They mean that no,60
NA,newspaper or radio station can own more than,60
NA,5 per cent of a television station which covers,60
NA,"the same service area. In return, no television",60
NA,station can own more than 15 per cent of any,60
NA,newspaper that circulates to more than 50 per,60
NA,cent of the service area. I know that the,60
NA,honourable member for Burke and perhaps a,60
NA,few other people have been arguing that there,60
NA,is an inconsistency and that we need to look,60
NA,at a 5 per cent limit on all directions instead,60
NA,of allowing a differential between newspaper,60
NA,investment in television and television invest-,60
NA,"ment in newspapers. However, that is some-",60
NA,thing that certainly will not be settled before,60
NA,the Fairfax bid is closed or before the owner-,60
NA,ship of the John Fairfax group is finalised.,60
NA,"As far as this Government is concerned,",60
NA,there is no problem in continuing to look at,60
NA,the cross-media ownership rules because there,60
NA,is a real commitment on this side of the,60
NA,House to ensure that the cross-media owner-,60
NA,ship rules apply and that we have that diversi-,60
NA,ty of points of view.,60
NA,I confess that I got a bit confused when the,60
NA,honourable member for Bass started his,60
NA,speech and said that this Bill creates even,60
NA,"more regulation, which tended to be some-",60
NA,thing that those on his side of politics reject-,60
NA,"ed, and that the legislation created confusion",60
NA,on the technical effects of the amendments.,60
NA,He said that at the end of the day the Opposi-,60
NA,tion would allow the legislation to pass and,60
NA,that any problems with the legislation should,60
NA,be addressed by the Government in particular,60
NA,and not by the Opposition. We are grateful,60
NA,that there will be no division in this House on,60
NA,this matter. Members of the Opposition may,60
NA,think that there are some defects in the legis-,60
NA,lation. It is disappointing that they were not,60
NA,"able to move amendments here today, but",60
NA,they wil1live to fight another day in the other,60
NA,House.,60
NA,It is very clear that the Government is,60
NA,introducing this legislation as a result of,60
NA,suggestions and recommendations from the,60
NA,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I personally,60
NA,think that the Government has done the right,60
NA,thing to require notification in examples,60
NA,where there could be difficulties for people,60
NA,bidding for media operations. We all know,60
NA,that at the moment most of the attention is,60
NA,focused on the Tourang bid for the John,60
NA,Fairfax group.,60
NA,This legislation provides for the Tourang,60
NA,group-the people who are deemed to be,60
NA,associates under the definition of this legisla-,60
NA,tion-to notify the Australian Broadcasting,60
NA,Tribunal and provide certain information to,60
NA,the Tribunal so that it is as informed as,60
NA,possible. The Minister for Transport and,60
NA,Communications is to be commended for the,60
NA,fact that this legislation has been brought in,60
NA,at quite short notice to ensure that the Broad-,60
NA,casting Tribunal has those extra powers so,60
NA,"that it is fully informed, can go to the Federal",60
NA,Court if it believes there is a breach of the,60
NA,"Act, and can take action to ensure that certain",60
NA,breaches are rectified. It is a very clear,60
NA,demonstration that the Government is not,60
NA,prepared to stand by and allow the Act to be,60
NA,ignored or circumvented. That is something,60
NA,which we support.,60
NA,A lot of the people who are opposed to the,60
NA,Tourang bid for the John Fairfax group have,60
NA,argued that Trevor Kennedy and Malcolm,60
NA,"Turnbull as individuals, because they have",60
NA,NA,60
NA,"dated Press in the past, should be defined as",60
NA,associates and any influence which they may,60
NA,have should be considered to be Kerry,60
NA,"Packer's influence. For the record, the House",60
NA,should be aware that in evidence to the print,60
NA,media inquiry last Tuesday Mr Kennedy,61
NA,denied that there would be such influence and,61
NA,"made it clear that, while the Tourang group",61
NA,has notified the Australian Broadcasting,61
NA,"Tribunal, it objected to any claims by people",61
NA,NA,61
NA,"Kennedy or Mr Turnbull, would be exercising",61
NA,control or influence. As to whether the,61
NA,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will accept,61
NA,that information or whether the Tribunal will,61
NA,"require greater information, that is a decision",61
NA,that we have to leave to the Tribunal. It is a,61
NA,"responsibility which, I am sure, it will dis-",61
NA,charge with proper regard to the legislation.,61
NA,"In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm my strong",61
NA,support for the cross-media ownership rules.,61
NA,I believe that they have had a positive influ-,61
NA,ence on diversity in the Australian media.,61
NA,Some people are unhappy with the extent of,61
NA,the diversity in the print media. That is an,61
NA,issue which is being addressed by the House,61
NA,of Representatives Select Committee on the,61
NA,Print Media. Any suggestion that the debate,61
NA,which is now taking place within the,61
NA,Government on foreign investment limits is,61
NA,creating confusion is made by people who,61
NA,ignore the fact that the alternative which,61
NA,currently exists provides a recipe for even,61
NA,greater confusion.,61
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (6.00,61
NA,p.m.)-Like the honourable member for Bass,61
NA,"( Mr Smith), I confess that I have some troub-",61
NA,le with the timing and the nature of the,61
NA,Broadcasting Amendment Bill. I respect the,61
NA,honourable member for Dobell ( Mr Lee) and,61
NA,his sincerity. I can assure him that there are,61
NA,a number of aspects about the timing of this,61
NA,legislation that are far too reminiscent of the,61
NA,way in which the Government dealt with the,61
NA,Wesley Vale application. We cannot change,61
NA,the rules in the middle of a game and we,61
NA,certainly cannot create a climate where no-,61
NA,body knows what the rules are. I have no,61
NA,worry about the Government setting the rules.,61
NA,I might not like the rules; I might not agree,61
NA,"with aspects of them, but I am most con-",61
NA,cerned about the whole approach to the,61
NA,establishment of the House of Representatives,61
NA,"Select Committee on the Print Media, the",61
NA,introduction and the debate of the Broadcast-,61
NA,ing Amendment Bill and the way in which the,61
NA,Fairfax bids are being elevated to be some-,61
NA,thing that is being dealt with in the particular,61
NA,instead of the general.,61
NA,"The first rule as a parliamentarian, and",61
NA,"certainly the first rule in government, is that",61
NA,one never legislates subjectively. If one is,61
NA,going to legislate one should make up one's,61
NA,mind on the general principle and should,61
NA,introduce whatever the particular measure,61
NA,might be to cover the generality of the field.,61
NA,As soon as one legislates subjectively one,61
NA,"creates problems and anomalies, distorts the",61
NA,pattern and certainly generates consequences,61
NA,that I do not think are desirable and in this,61
NA,"instance, I would suggest, are commercially",61
NA,reprehensible.,61
NA,The first thing that people should under-,61
NA,stand is that the debate within Labor Caucus,61
NA,and the vacillation about the percentage of,61
NA,overseas ownership seriously prejudice the,61
NA,price that the three potential bidders will,61
NA,make for the Fairfax assets. We have to,61
NA,"understand that, quite unrelated to anything",61
NA,"the Government is doing, the receivers are",61
NA,"properly saying, 'We want bids by a certain",61
NA,date'. They have set down the date. The date,61
NA,is next week. That is something that is being,61
NA,done in the commercial market outside poli-,61
NA,tics. It is being done because the receivers,61
NA,have a responsibility to the creditors. Were,61
NA,they not to set a date and wait while the,61
NA,Government and the Labor Party made up its,61
NA,"mind, they would be acting irresponsibly. To",61
NA,"satisfy the cries of the creditors, the receivers",61
NA,need to make sure that they get the best,61
NA,possible bid for the assets.,61
NA,"The honourable member for Dobell, as",61
NA,"Chairman of the Media Committee, has",61
NA,referred to evidence submitted to that Com-,61
NA,mittee. It is public evidence and it is quite,61
NA,proper that he should do so. It has been,61
NA,suggested in evidence given to the Committee,61
NA,that there is a variation in the price that we,61
NA,can pay according to the extent to which there,61
NA,are going to be components of overseas funds,61
NA,"or domestic funds, the price we have to pay",61
NA,"for the money, the extent to which there are",61
NA,"associates or non-associates, the extent to",61
NA,which the junk bond holders have some sort,61
NA,of preferential arrangement through Tourang,61
NA,"or not, and the extent to which one of the",61
NA,associates-he mayor may not be an,62
NA,associate-involved can determine the extent,62
NA,to which others mayor may not deal with,62
NA,those junk bond holders.,62
NA,I have no complaint about the Government,62
NA,"introducing legislation on overseas ownership,",62
NA,the way in which particular interests can be,62
NA,determined-I will address this in a mo-,62
NA,ment-or the way in which the Broadcasting,62
NA,Tribunal can run its eye over forward bids,62
NA,"and determine in advance of circumstances,",62
NA,particularly bearing in mind the bid for 2UE,62
NA,that the honourable member for Bass referred,62
NA,"to, to ensure that there is not a circumstance",62
NA,created which might breach the intent of the,62
NA,legislation before the actual bid takes place.,62
NA,I do have a concern when commercial,62
NA,market forces are disrupted. In the present,62
NA,instance it would be my strong recommenda-,62
NA,tion to the Government that we should not,62
NA,proceed with this legislation because on,62
NA,"Monday, 15 October, the receivers have said,",62
NA,they will receive the bids. I believe-the,62
NA,honourable member for Bass has already said,62
NA,it-that there are defects in the present law.,62
NA,I do not think that we will be able to give,62
NA,sufficient precision to the marketplace be-,62
NA,tween now and the time those liquidators take,62
NA,those bids to be able to clear the position to,62
NA,the certain knowledge of the participants.,62
NA,For that reason it would qe far better,62
NA,adjourned the debate and looked at this Bill,62
NA,"on its merits after next Monday. Equally, I",62
NA,would suggest to Caucus members that even,62
NA,though I know of their emotions and concerns,62
NA,about overseas ownership-and I can assure,62
NA,"them, they are not unique; there are a lot of",62
NA,Australians out there who worry about not,62
NA,only the percentage of overseas ownership but,62
NA,also the source of the money-it would be far,62
NA,better if we set aside this legislation and if,62
NA,"Caucus set aside its debate and said, 'We",62
NA,have got a real worry about the percentage of,62
NA,overseas ownership but we are not going to,62
NA,interfere in the process of the marketplace,62
NA,before the liquidators receive their bids'.,62
NA,It could be that after next Monday they,62
NA,have their debate and they introduce legisla-,62
NA,tion. It really concerns me that the honourable,62
NA,member for Dobell has suggested that it is,62
NA,rather strange that Mr Kennedy should seek,62
NA,to comply with this legislation. Everybody,62
NA,accepts that the Government has the capacity,62
NA,"to pass legislation, at least through this",62
NA,"chamber, and if he sees this legislation and",62
NA,"thinks, 'Well, you are going to introduce it',",62
NA,of course he is going to try to comply with it.,62
NA,That should not be the basis for either Mr,62
NA,Kennedy or any other of the participants in,62
NA,the bid making a judgment about what they,62
NA,are going to do. On the basis of the,62
NA,information and the law as it now exists and,62
NA,"their interpretation of it, and the apprehension",62
NA,"that there might be some changes, they have",62
NA,to make their judgment and they ought to be,62
NA,able to do that between now and next,62
NA,Monday. I believe that would be the right,62
NA,way for this House to deal with this legisla-,62
NA,tion.,62
NA,We should set aside this debate and not,62
NA,pass this legislation today; Caucus ought to,62
NA,defer its debate till after next Monday and,62
NA,then we can come back to it. We could then,62
NA,deal with the legislation next Tuesday or the,62
NA,day after the liquidators have received the,62
NA,bids. We would be in a position to make our,62
NA,"judgment not partially, not subjectively, not",62
NA,specifically in relation to the Fairfax circum-,62
NA,"stances, but a bit more generally. The bidders",62
NA,are going to have to make their judgment on,62
NA,"the basis of the law as it is today, knowing",62
NA,"if we that there has been public debate, knowing",62
NA,that there is a committee which is going to,62
NA,make a recommendation sometime before the,62
NA,end of the year and that the laws might,62
NA,change before their bids come into place.,62
NA,That is the opening position which I believe,62
NA,is fairly important. We have had far too much,62
NA,"Government prevarication, far too much",62
NA,Government emotional reaction and far too,62
NA,"much uncertainty in the marketplace-and,",62
NA,"above all, we cannot afford it at the moment.",62
NA,Australia is not in the brightest of economic,62
NA,conditions. We do have real difficulties in,62
NA,trying to promote the sort of new investment,62
NA,"that is needed and, whatever our individual",62
NA,"views might be, the people who are putting",62
NA,up their bids for John Fairfax ought to be able,62
NA,to compete in a way which ensures that they,62
NA,"are all on even ground, that they are all",62
NA,competing under the law as it is now and not,62
NA,"as it might be. So, beginning from there, I am",62
NA,concerned that there seems to be a shifting of,63
NA,"the sands of government policy, which are",63
NA,"indetenninate, imprecise and really quite",63
NA,"disruptive to the liquidator, or the receivers as",63
NA,"they are in this instance, receiving the best",63
NA,bids on commercial grounds for the assets of,63
NA,John Fairfax.,63
NA,The second thing I want to say is that if,63
NA,this legislation is to be dealt with I would,63
NA,have preferred that at the same time we had,63
NA,a little more precision about where the,63
NA,practices legislation is going. Again before,63
NA,"Committee, and it is public knowledge, there",63
NA,has been debate between the AttorneyDavid,63
NA,General's Department and the Trade Practices,63
NA,"Commission-its Chairman, its Deputy as",63
NA,Chainnan and its members-as to what sort,63
NA,of role the trade practices legislation should,63
NA,play regarding the media. We have been,63
NA,"talking about market dominance and, before",63
NA,"one gets to that, one has to detennine what",63
NA,the market. Is the market print media? Is the,63
NA,market media in general? What is the market,63
NA,and how is one going to determine the role,63
NA,the Trade Practices Commission?,63
NA,I share the view of the honourable member,63
NA,for Bass that one commendable feature about,63
NA,this legislation is that there is going to,63
NA,"some cross-membership. That is great, but",63
NA,does not really satisfy us. One of my bugs,63
NA,that we seem to keep on proliferating bodies.,63
NA,I spoke a few moments ago about my concern,63
NA,in relation to EPIC. It might well be that patory areas.,63
NA,setting up EFIC as a separate statutory,63
NA,"corporation is the way to go, it might well be",63
NA,that giving the Broadcasting Tribunal addi-,63
NA,"tional power is the way to go, but I want to",63
NA,know what is going to be done about the,63
NA,trade practices legislation. I would like to,63
NA,know what role the commission is going to,63
NA,play. I am equally concerned about the,63
NA,role. I do not agree with the present Treasurer,63
NA,"( Mr Kerin) on many things, but I was inter-",63
NA,ested to see his comment about the way in,63
NA,which the FIRE role is exercised. It is quite,63
NA,a correct exposition. The FIRE receives the,63
NA,"application, then there is a discussion on the",63
NA,basis of the foreign content as to whether or,63
NA,not there needs to be an acceptance or rejecpowers,63
NA,tion of the bids and the particular foreign,63
NA,content that is there and whether or not it,63
NA,going to be rejected or accepted. It does not,63
NA,really matter whether Caucus says it is an,63
NA,arbitrary 20 per cent and how the 20 per cent,63
NA,is defined and whether it is equity or non-,63
NA,equity or quasi-equity; it is essentially a,63
NA,matter which the FIRE and Treasury look at,63
NA,in relation to what they see as being in the,63
NA,public interest.,63
NA,"Having said all that, there is a problem in",63
NA,"giving to the present Broadcasting Tribunal,",63
NA,"trade in my view, any more power. I am very",63
NA,the unhappy with the way the Australian Broad-,63
NA,casting Tribunal has been functioning since,63
NA,Jones departed. David Jones was,63
NA,exemplary in the way in which he functioned,63
NA,"the Chairman of the Broadcasting Tribunal,",63
NA,and since then the body has become far too,63
NA,legalistic. The extent to which a bevy of silks,63
NA,has to be employed in order to explain even,63
NA,the very humblest of licence applications is a,63
NA,is disgrace. We have set up this great bureau-,63
NA,"cracy, in the legal sense, in order to look at",63
NA,what should be virtually routine licence,63
NA,"of renewal applications. The powers of the ABT,",63
NA,"to my mind, have moved way beyond the",63
NA,intention of the Parliament when the ABT,63
NA,was set up. I am worried that the ABT still,63
NA,has not enough participation from people who,63
NA,"be are out there in the broadcasting world, not",63
NA,it just people who have run radio stations or,63
NA,"is who have been involved in electronic media,",63
NA,but people who have a bit of interest perhaps,63
NA,"in music, drama and some of the other partici-",63
NA,I would prefer to see the Broadcasting,63
NA,Tribunal as more of a body looking at the,63
NA,public interest and less of what it sees itself,63
NA,as-a legal tribunal trying to adjudicate on,63
NA,the interpretation of aspects within the legisla-,63
NA,tion. While I would accept that the Federal,63
NA,FIRE Court is going to have some powers as a,63
NA,result of this legislation-and section 9 of the,63
NA,Bill refers to that-it should not only be a,63
NA,matter of legalities; it ought to be more a,63
NA,matter of looking at what is in the public,63
NA,interest and how we can best serve the,63
NA,community.,63
NA,I am worried about giving additional,63
NA,to the Broadcasting Tribunal. I would,63
NA,like to know a little more about its relation-,63
NA,"is ship with the Trade Practices Commission,",63
NA,and I would like to see a resolution of who is,64
NA,going to have what powers. As the honour-,64
NA,"able member for Bass said, the Common-",64
NA,wealth at the moment does not have power in,64
NA,the print media. It does have power with res-,64
NA,pect to market dominance. This intrudes and,64
NA,makes the whole thing a bit of a hotchpotch.,64
NA,I want to refer to a couple of other aspects,64
NA,of the debate. There is a worry about the,64
NA,"narrowness of the media in Australia, with the",64
NA,smallness of our population and the concen-,64
NA,tration of ownership. I have no doubts about,64
NA,"that. Indeed, some have pointed with con-",64
NA,cern-indeed quite properly-to the way in,64
NA,which chequebook journalism seeks to influ-,64
NA,ence individuals. There is a whole range of,64
NA,"instances where, as politicians from both sides",64
NA,"of politics, we can look with apprehension at",64
NA,the way in which the media has influenced,64
NA,election results. Without wishing to go into it,64
NA,"to any great degree, there is no doubt in my",64
NA,mind that one of the reasons the late Bill,64
NA,MCMahon lost the 1972 election was the,64
NA,change in ownership of the Sydney Daily,64
NA,Telegraph. That is an historical fact. It can,64
NA,demonstrated in relation to the presentation,64
NA,that consumer-type news in the Daily,64
NA,Telegraph that the change in emphasis,64
NA,one side of politics to the other influenced,64
NA,result.,64
NA,"Talking about chequebook journalism, I",64
NA,one of those who have been most concerned,64
NA,about the way in which the former wife of the,64
NA,Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson),64
NA,been given a great deal of publicity in what,64
NA,I see as a distorted presentation of what are,64
NA,"very personal matters, distorted because they",64
NA,have been given a prominence which I do not,64
NA,think is justified merely because it involves,64
NA,the personal life of a politician.,64
NA,"It has been suggested to me, quite seriously,",64
NA,that it is all a matter of a particular media,64
NA,"proprietor saying, 'Look, no matter who you",64
NA,"are or where you are, we are able to assert",64
NA,authority over you. We are able to throw,64
NA,"details of your personal life and, by throwing",64
NA,"up details of your personal life, we are able",64
NA,to call on you to act in a certain way'. It has,64
NA,been suggested to me that in this instance,64
NA,"whole emphasis, the real target, was the Prime",64
NA,Minister ( Mr Hawke) as this particular media,64
NA,proprietor is supposed to be a supporter of the,64
NA,honourable member for Blaxland ( Mr,64
NA,Keating).,64
NA,"Whether that is so or not, that is the impli-",64
NA,cation in our society. Our media is a very,64
NA,"small, restricted one, and the dominance of",64
NA,one or two proprietors is such that people are,64
NA,apprehensive. That tends to taint the extent to,64
NA,which one can make a dispassionate judgment,64
NA,on matters of profound public policy and,64
NA,importance. It concerns me that there should,64
NA,"be suggestions that, through chequebook",64
NA,"journalism, undue influence can be asserted.",64
NA,"It is, therefore, much more difficult for us in",64
NA,Parliament to determine the best way to,64
NA,"ensure the distribution of competition, and fair",64
NA,"and open competition, amongst different",64
NA,segments of the media.,64
NA,I happen to be a person who is against,64
NA,cross-media ownership restraints. I recognise,64
NA,the problems with that. I am not going to,64
NA,"argue the case now, but I am concerned that",64
NA,be in the present circumstances there are three,64
NA,of prime bidders for Fairfax. That is the most,64
NA,significant matter in the media area at the,64
NA,from moment. We have had problems with take-,64
NA,the overs of television stations by entrepreneurs.,64
NA,There are enormous financial difficulties still,64
NA,in the television and radio worlds. The fact,64
NA,am that the receivers have moved into Fairfax,64
NA,demonstrates that in spite of the very profit-,64
NA,"able state of the Fairfax group, there are still",64
NA,has difficulties in the print media too.,64
NA,I am concerned that the Parliament not,64
NA,generate a climate of uncertainty. I strongly,64
NA,put it to the House that it would be far better,64
NA,"for us to defer this legislation. In that climate,",64
NA,each of those bidders can put in their bids,64
NA,before the event. They can take note of the,64
NA,fact that there is a debate in the Labor Caucus,64
NA,and that the Parliament will be dealing with,64
NA,"legislation, although they will not know what",64
NA,up it will be. Acting under the law that now,64
NA,"exists, they should put their bids in. Indeed,",64
NA,"for my money, I would prefer not only that",64
NA,"they put their bids in, but also that the receiv-",64
NA,the ers be able to make their judgment on who is,64
NA,the preferred bidder under the law as it is now,64
NA,"and not face interference and intervention, as",64
NA,"I see it, in an arbitrary way as a result of the",65
NA,legislation this House is now debating.,65
NA,Sitting suspended from 6.18 to 8 p.m.,65
Mr ELLIOTT ,parramatta) (8.00 p.m.)-In,65
NA,speaking to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill,65
NA,"1991, I would like at the outset to say what",65
NA,this Bill does cover rather than deal with,65
NA,some of the comments made previously which,65
NA,related to things that the Bill does not cover.,65
NA,I think it may be worth while restating the,65
NA,key provisions of the Bill. The Bill will,65
NA,amend the Broadcasting Act to:,65
NA,(a) require that the Australian Broadcasting,65
NA,Tribunal be given prior written notice of acquisi-,65
NA,"tions of interests which could contravene that Act,",65
NA,including a contravention that would arise if the,65
NA,interests of associates were aggregated;,65
NA,(b) increase the ABT's powers to gather,65
NA,information on the ownership and control arrange-,65
NA,ments for media outlets to assist the Tribunal in,65
NA,determining whether the ownership and control,65
NA,"rules of the Act have been, or are likely to be,",65
NA,contravened; and,65
NA,(c) strengthen the powers of the Federal Court,65
NA,protect licensees and other companies and to,65
NA,"prevent, or prevent the continuation of, contraven-",65
NA,"tions of the ownership and control rules, either on",65
NA,an interim basis to enable proposed acquisitions of,65
NA,interests to be appropriately investigated or on a,65
NA,more permanent basis.,65
NA,It is difficult to conduct the debate on this,65
NA,amendment Bill without reference to contem-,65
NA,"porary affairs, particularly the Fairfax bid and",65
NA,so forth. But it is important to say at the,65
NA,outset that this particular provision has rel-,65
NA,evance to the range of cross-media ownership,65
NA,requirements that have been introduced by the,65
NA,Government as part of its broadcasting policy.,65
NA,Those cross-media ownership rules are clear,65
NA,and well established. What these amendments,65
NA,"do, fundamentally, is make sure that the spirit",65
NA,and principles that everyone understood,65
NA,applied to the Broadcasting Act as far as,65
NA,cross-media ownership rules are concerned are,65
NA,adhered to.,65
NA,In all the discussion that has been going on,65
NA,in recent weeks and months about what would,65
NA,"happen to Fairfax, the Minister for Transport",65
NA,and Communications ( Mr Beazley) has made,65
NA,it abundantly clear at all times that the,65
NA,Government would require that the cross-,65
NA,"media ownership rules, as outlined in the",65
NA,"Broadcasting Act, were adhered to by all the",65
NA,respective bidders for the Fairfax organisation.,65
NA,"It is with, that in mind that this particular",65
NA,"provision has been introduced, because it",65
NA,"gives the proactive role to the ABT, which is",65
NA,important in this area. It recognises the legal,65
NA,"cases that have been referred to. Particularly,",65
NA,it recognises the experiences of the 2UE,65
NA,"discussion, where it proved difficult to estab-",65
NA,lish just who had effective ownership and,65
NA,control of that particular organisation. Above,65
NA,"all else, it says that the Government has the",65
NA,"cross-media ownership rules, that they are",65
NA,"there for a reason and are there to be applied,",65
NA,"and that it will not be possible for anyone, by",65
NA,"a device or mechanism, to subvert the intent",65
NA,of those rules.,65
NA,"So it is wrong to suggest, as did the right",65
NA,honourable member for New England ( Mr,65
NA,Sinclair) and the honourable member for Bass,65
NA,"( Mr Smith), that some confusion is somehow",65
NA,involved in this process. There is not any,65
NA,confusion about the 15 per cent requirement,65
NA,to under the cross-media ownership rules. What,65
NA,there may have been was some people seek-,65
NA,ing to extend beyond the spirit of that legal,65
NA,requirement. I do not know whether anyone,65
NA,was trying to do that when the respective,65
NA,people appeared before the Select Committee,65
NA,on the Print Media. They said that they under-,65
NA,"stood those rules and accypted them. They,",65
NA,"like some members of the Opposition, do not",65
NA,necessarily agree with aspects of the cross-,65
NA,"media ownership rules. Nevertheless, they",65
NA,have accepted the importance and relevance,65
NA,of them in their consideration of bids for,65
NA,Fairfax.,65
NA,"With that in mind, I think it is right that the",65
NA,Government has taken up the suggestion-,65
NA,"which has come from a number of quarters,",65
NA,including the Tribunal itself-that it needed,65
NA,to have the proactive investigative power to,65
NA,ensure that it could properly analyse owner-,65
NA,ship and control bids for media outlets in a,65
NA,prospective transaction. It is fair to say that it,65
NA,is important that the Tribunal have that right.,65
NA,"Historically, some matters relating to media",65
NA,ownership in Australia have been very diffi-,65
NA,cult in terms of defining exactly who has,65
NA,ownership. I recall particularly the recent,65
NA,experience with television. The tracing provi-,65
NA,sions for television under the Broadcasting,65
NA,Act do make it difficult for people to establish,66
NA,precisely who has ownership of all the various,66
NA,direct interests and who has control of those,66
NA,particular establishments.,66
NA,"This Bill, I think, clears up a lot of that",66
NA,ambiguity. It gives a definition of 'associates'.,66
NA,At the print media inquiry Mr Trevor,66
NA,Kennedy did express some criticism of this;,66
NA,nevertheless the Bill has cleared up the,66
NA,uncertainty as to what 'associate' means. It,66
NA,"gives a precise definition, which I will not",66
NA,"read out tonight, but it does make very clear",66
NA,that where people have a direct interest the,66
NA,Tribunal will have the power to go to the nub,66
NA,of the matter to establish what that really,66
NA,"means in respect of the prospective purchase,",66
NA,share transaction or the like.,66
NA,There is no doubt that there is a very strong,66
NA,"argument that the media, because of its",66
NA,influence and its fundamental role in democ-,66
NA,"racy, should be treated as a special category",66
NA,in terms of our industry policy. That is why,66
NA,it is important that the Tribunal have its,66
NA,proactive powers. It is important that there be,66
NA,"an overlap, as there is, between the role of the",66
NA,Broadcasting Tribunal and that of the Trade,66
NA,Practices Commission. The cross-relationship,66
NA,that they have is important in establishing the,66
NA,links between broadcasting and the print,66
NA,media particularly.,66
NA,It is very pleasing to note that one of the,66
NA,"initiatives that hav,e been taken is to ensure",66
NA,that the Deputy President of the Trade Prac-,66
NA,tices Commission will sit as a member of the,66
NA,Broadcasting Tribunal in these sorts of cases.,66
NA,That provides the sort of experience and,66
NA,expertise that is useful in getting the discus-,66
NA,sion on the respective forms of media on a,66
NA,coherent basis. In a democracy one can only,66
NA,cherish and treat very seriously the needs and,66
NA,concerns that we all have for information. We,66
NA,need to make sure that the range of ownership,66
NA,of information is diverse so as to ensure that,66
NA,the community's access to information sour-,66
NA,ces is taken very seriously indeed.,66
NA,It is with those sorts of provisions in mind,66
NA,"that these amendments are brought forward,",66
NA,as has been the case with other amendments,66
NA,to the Broadcasting Act in recent times. I,66
NA,would be the first to say that some of them,66
NA,"are fairly complex. But it is difficult, when",66
NA,one is dealing with transactions such as the,66
NA,"receivership of Channel 7, to have other than",66
NA,complex tracing provisions. We need such,66
NA,provisions to ensure that we can get a full,66
NA,"understanding of who has control, who has",66
NA,"real interest, who has real equity, and who has",66
NA,real influence in terms of the particular media,66
NA,establishment.,66
NA,"I believe that if, as the Tribunal itself has",66
NA,"sought in the past, the Tribunal is given the",66
NA,opportunity to investigate prior to the final,66
NA,"decisions being made in these matters, it will",66
NA,be better placed to ensure that the coherent,66
NA,spirit of the Broadcasting Act is complied,66
NA,with by all players.,66
NA,The licensing arrangements under the ABT,66
NA,have highlighted the capacity of some media,66
NA,players to thwart or tie up that process in,66
NA,unnecessary litigation. Earlier this evening the,66
NA,right honourable member for New England,66
NA,suggested that the Broadcasting Tribunal's,66
NA,actions in recent times had not been effective,66
NA,because the Broadcasting Tribunal had resort-,66
NA,ed too much to legalism. I think that in some,66
NA,of the most notable licence hearings involving,66
NA,the Broadcasting Tribunal it was anything but,66
NA,the Broadcasting Tribunal that actually sought,66
NA,to tie up those matters. Rather it was some of,66
NA,the major players themselves who had used,66
NA,legal mechanisms to thwart the clear spirit of,66
NA,the Broadcasting Act at the time and had used,66
NA,the processes of the courts as a means of,66
NA,delaying and diverting the true spirit and,66
NA,intent of the Broadcasting Act in a number of,66
NA,important ways.,66
NA,The provisions in this Bill give the Tribunal,66
NA,that proactive role. They will ensure that prior,66
NA,written notification of acquisitions of interests,66
NA,is clearly established for all to see. As we,66
NA,"have heard, the Tourang people have already,",66
NA,"on the basis of the foreshadowed legislation,",66
NA,taken the step of referring their particular,66
NA,matters to the Tribunal for scrutiny in the first,66
NA,place. That is as it should be. I think it is,66
NA,"important that this application to interest,",66
NA,which could give rise to contravention of the,66
NA,"ownership and control rules, is clearly under-",66
NA,stood as something that each of the respective,66
NA,players has to follow through.,66
NA,"Again, the range of consortia and interests",66
NA,which playa role in the various aspects of the,66
NA,Australian conununity really highlight why,67
NA,there is a significant concern in this regard.,67
NA,"Clearly, all aspects of our media are very",67
NA,powerful weapons. It is important that if we,67
NA,are going to be serious about trying to get,67
NA,"diversity, we should ensure that, first of all,",67
NA,"the cross-media ownership rules apply and,",67
NA,"secondly, that the foreign ownership require-",67
NA,ments which help ensure the Australian cul-,67
NA,ture and identity that we seek from our media,67
NA,"and which, just as importantly, I think the",67
NA,"Australian public are concerned about, are",67
NA,carried through as well.,67
NA,The impact of the notification requirements,67
NA,will not remove the fundamental duty of the,67
NA,Tribunal to establish that a contravention of,67
NA,the Act has occurred. The various bidders that,67
NA,are involved are required to give prior notifi-,67
NA,cation. It is still up to the Tribunal,67
NA,lish that it has the grounds on which to take,67
NA,the matter to the Federal Court if it believes,67
NA,that a contravention has occurred.,67
NA,Some have said-and the honourable,67
NA,member for Bass referred to this criticism-,67
NA,that this provision does not go far enough. I,67
NA,"believe, from what has been explained so far,",67
NA,that the Tribunal regards itself as being much,67
NA,better placed to be able to make judgments,67
NA,about these matters by having the prior,67
NA,notification power that this amendment,67
NA,"provides. Admittedly, there is a tight time",67
NA,frame but that is there for quite obvious,67
NA,reasons. The amendment will ensure that it,67
NA,has the scope to be able to go to the Federal,67
NA,Court if it believes that a contravention of the,67
NA,Act has occurred. So the onus of proof-the,67
NA,presumption of innocence-that one would,67
NA,"say applies to many Acts, will still apply to",67
NA,the Broadcasting Act after this change. Never-,67
NA,"theless, the legislation facilitates the Tribunal",67
NA,being in a position to ensure that adherence,67
NA,to the spirit of the law is applied all the way,67
NA,through the process.,67
NA,The intention of the Bill is not to be un-,67
NA,necessarily intrusive as far as arrangements,67
NA,"for the ABT are concerned. Clearly, certain",67
NA,classes of people might be affected in some,67
NA,way by an associate provision that the Bill is,67
NA,not meant to apply to. The Tribunal can make,67
NA,a judgment about those matters. If it deter-,67
NA,mines that further action is not required in,67
NA,respect of certain classes of people as far as,67
NA,"an associate notification is concerned, that is",67
NA,a matter that the Tribunal can bring to the,67
NA,attention of the Parliament. The matter can be,67
NA,laid on the table and if the regulation that is,67
NA,attached is deemed to be not agreed with by,67
NA,"the Parliament, it can be disallowed.",67
NA,The determination process gives the Tribu-,67
NA,nal the power to exercise its functions proper-,67
NA,"ly. At the same time, it ultimately gives the",67
NA,Parliament the sanction over those matters,67
NA,relating to the Broadcasting Act. So to sug-,67
NA,gest in any sense that this does not achieve,67
NA,the sort of objective that most people would,67
NA,be seeking as far as compliance with cross-,67
NA,"media ownership rules is concerned, that it",67
NA,"does not go far enough, suggests that those",67
NA,people have not fully understood the provi-,67
NA,to estab- sions of the Bill.,67
NA,The next matter that is important to refer to,67
NA,in respect of these issues obviously comes to,67
NA,the questions relating to the impact on the,67
NA,Fairfax bid. As various speakers have said in,67
NA,"the debate, the intention is to receive the bids",67
NA,on 15 October. A number of things have been,67
NA,raised already in this discussion. People have,67
NA,"said, 'Well, the Parliament should not be",67
NA,getting involved in this-it should be left to,67
NA,the marketplace to determine the whole issue.,67
NA,It is not a matter for the Parliament until after,67
NA,the bids are in'. I think the right honourable,67
NA,member for New England referred to that,67
NA,earlier this evening. There are a few key,67
NA,points to be made on that issue.,67
NA,"First of all, the cross-media ownership rule",67
NA,has been there all the way through the,67
NA,process. That is not new. It is not changing,67
NA,"the rules, as some people have suggested. The",67
NA,"cross-media ownership rule, the 15 per cent",67
NA,limit on newspaper ownership that is placed,67
NA,on a television proprietor in a major area,67
NA,applied well in advance of the Fairfax con-,67
NA,sideration. But it has been said quite clearly,67
NA,that we are going to make sure that the law-,67
NA,and the Minister has made this abundantly·,67
NA,clear-that applies in relation to that issue is,67
NA,going to be the subject of very strict and total,67
NA,compliance by the Government. The amend-,67
NA,ment before us is nothing more than ensuring,67
NA,"that that rule, that law, that we understood",67
NA,was the way the process was to work is,67
NA,actually going to be strictly complied with.,68
NA,is completely without foundation to suggest,68
NA,"that that is somehow shifting the goal post,",68
NA,"shifting the sands, or whatever other expresto",68
NA,sion is used.,68
NA,As a result of the experiences that we have,68
NA,"had already with other cases, it is clear that",68
NA,the will of the Parliament in relation to,68
NA,cross-media ownership rules should be up-,68
NA,held. I do not suggest that any of the particufundamental,68
NA,lar bidders in relation to Fairfax were not,68
NA,going to do that. I am saying to the House,68
NA,that to give the Tribunal the power to ensure,68
NA,that those rules are adhered to at the outset,68
NA,appears to me to be pretty fundamental to a,68
NA,discussion about real cross-media ownership.,68
NA,"If the Opposition, as the honourable member",68
NA,"for Bass said earlier today in the debate,",68
NA,basically supportive of cross-media ownercountries.,68
NA,"ship, surely it would want to ensure that",68
NA,cross-media ownership rules are applied,68
NA,effectively.,68
NA,That brings me to the next point: what do,68
NA,we want to try to achieve with our media,68
NA,ownership? Surely there are important things,68
NA,that we try to achieve. We try to ensure that,68
NA,there is a real diversity of ownership of,68
NA,Australian media. We try to ensure that a,68
NA,range of opinion is expressed in all the major,68
NA,"markets and, hopefully, in the provincial, rural dominance.",68
NA,"and regional areas as well. Clearly, part of the",68
NA,process of that is ensuring that there are rules,68
NA,relating to fair competition. The tests about,68
NA,what is competitiveness as far as media is,68
NA,concerned may well have to be different to,68
NA,what applies in other areas of what would,68
NA,normally come under the trade practice hiw.,68
NA,That leads me to the issue that was before,68
NA,the print media inquiry last week. The Trade,68
NA,Practices Commission suggested that one,68
NA,the things that it believes is important for,68
NA,future is to ensure that the test relating to,68
NA,competition be changed from one of market,68
NA,dominance to one based on the issue of,68
NA,stantial lessening of competition. There is,68
NA,fundamental difference between those two able.,68
NA,approaches in terms of how one determines,68
NA,"this area of ownership and control. Clearly,",68
NA,the Trade Practices Commission applied as its,68
NA,major test the substantial lessening of competo.,68
NA,"tition, we would ensure that we would get",68
NA,It less concentration of ownership. It is my view,68
NA,that one of the issues that the print media,68
NA,"inquiry and, ultimately, the Government need",68
NA,look at is a change in that direction that,68
NA,would give the Trade Practices Commission's,68
NA,submission that was made at last week's,68
NA,"hearing real legal weight. Clearly, unless we",68
NA,"do that, unless we change the basic philoso-",68
NA,the phy to one of a substantial lessening of,68
NA,"competition, we will really not get to the",68
NA,problem of how to achieve more,68
NA,diversity and a greater range of ownership of,68
NA,Australian media. That is something that I,68
NA,believe most people in the community would,68
NA,regard as significant.,68
NA,Concentration is one of the fundamental,68
NA,problems that we have had to encounter in,68
NA,was Australia-much more so than in many other,68
NA,It was at least in part because of,68
NA,the current requirement about market domi-,68
NA,nance that Professor Fels said to us last week,68
NA,that the Trade Practices Commission would,68
NA,like to be more assertive and vigorous in its,68
NA,approach to this issue but is constrained by,68
NA,current legal requirements. I believe that in,68
NA,"terms of media ownership, a strong case can",68
NA,be argued that substantial lessening of compe-,68
NA,tition should be the test applied to media,68
NA,rather than the one that relates to market,68
NA,In the remaining time that is available to,68
NA,"me, I want to refer to a couple of other issues.",68
NA,As one of his other contributions to the,68
NA,"debate, the·right honourable member for New",68
NA,England suggested that it was not proper for,68
NA,the Government to be changing the rules in,68
NA,mid-stream. He asserted that this was happen-,68
NA,ing with this Bill. Before I came into this,68
NA,place I recall the Murdoch Bill which was,68
NA,of introduced by the Fraser Government. It is,68
NA,the worth noting that that change broke all the,68
NA,"rules. As the Minister of the day at that time,",68
NA,I think the right honourable member for New,68
NA,subEngland probably had some part in that.,68
NA,a Those sorts of changes are not terribly desir-,68
NA,"In this particular amendment, we are sug-",68
NA,if gesting that the spirit and the letter of the,68
NA,cross-media ownership rule should be adhered,68
NA,That is what this Bill provides for. It,68
NA,defines closely how that should occur. For,68
NA,those reasons I believe it is a Bill that is,69
NA,saying that the law that Parliament has al-,69
NA,ready enacted should be fully complied with.,69
NA,We are going to pass an amendment that,69
NA,ensures the Tribunal has the added power to,69
NA,make sure that actually occurs. For that,69
NA,reason I believe it is one that should have the,69
NA,full and total support of the whole of the,69
NA,Parliament.,69
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (8.20 p.m.)-This,69
NA,is another piece of legislation which follows,69
NA,a whole series of legislation that started back,69
NA,"in 1985, with more in 1986 and 1987, dealing",69
NA,"with the ownership of Australian media,",69
NA,"particularly, of course, radio and television;",69
NA,with the market reach of television stations,69
NA,and their proprietors; with how much of,69
NA,"market they were allowed to have; and,",69
NA,"subsequently, with rules on cross-media",69
NA,"ownership. From its day of coming to office,",69
NA,this Government has seen media policy as just,69
NA,another tool to be used in its quest for,69
NA,"ing power. Decision after decision, legislation",69
NA,"after legislation, the Government has drafted",69
NA,to enable it to play its favourites in the,69
NA,"field and to be able to produce the results,",69
NA,"after inquiries and after legislation, that",69
NA,predictable if one looked at the players.,69
NA,There was the condemnation prior to the,69
NA,1983 election of Murdoch and his influence,69
NA,"on previous election results, but quickly after",69
NA,assuming office there were amendments to,69
NA,suit the News Ltd group. It did not seem to,69
NA,worry the Government at that time that,69
NA,fonner foe was encouraged to become an ally.,69
NA,There were rules changed about the nationalirevenue,69
NA,ty of people who were allowed to participate,69
NA,in the ownership of the Australian media.,69
NA,"Time and again, when the Government Channel",69
NA,"brought measures in, one only had to listen",69
NA,the words of Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) or,69
NA,"the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, to",69
NA,results of many of these media decisions.,69
NA,I remember the Minister for Communicachanges,69
NA,"tions at the time, Mr Duffy, holding out",69
NA,a 43 per cent limit on ownership in reach. the legislation:,69
NA,"The Prime Minister said, 'No, it is going to",69
NA,be 60 per cent'. The Prime Minister and the legislative,69
NA,"Treasurer at that time, Mr Keating,",69
NA,day with the 60 per cent fonnula. The 60 per,69
NA,"cent fonnula was, in fact, a process whereby",69
NA,a situation that had already occurred in,69
NA,ownership was legalised after the event. After,69
NA,the event had occurred and the bounds had,69
NA,"been exceeded, suddenly the Government",69
NA,"decided to legalise that process. So, in the",69
NA,"main, the whole of media business for the",69
NA,Government has been not an objective exer-,69
NA,"cise, but an exercise in using media policy as",69
NA,a political tool for its own benefit. Foreign,69
NA,ownership and the ambiguous attitudes of the,69
NA,"Government-in this instance, foreign nation-",69
NA,ality and ambiguous attitudes on the part of,69
NA,this Government-have been a theme con-,69
NA,stantly recurring.,69
NA,We had a change of the main players,69
NA,following that cross-media ownership legisla-,69
NA,the tion in 1986. New players came onto the,69
NA,"field. They were Alan Bond, Robert Holmes",69
NA,"a'Court, Kerry Stokes and Christopher Skase.",69
NA,The names will be remembered by Australians,69
NA,because they were the big bidders who hoist-,69
NA,retained the market to untold heights after the,69
NA,Government's decision of that period in 1986.,69
NA,"In playing with the policy of media, the",69
NA,media Government was successful in building the,69
NA,assets of a few very favoured Australians.,69
NA,were Many of those favourite Australians are no,69
NA,"longer with or us or are no longer in business,",69
NA,but they were the big players of the day.,69
NA,I remind the House and the Australian,69
NA,people of the changes that have taken place,69
NA,"in the whole of this media area. In 1983, we",69
NA,had three basically strong and equal television,69
NA,"a networks: Channel 7, Channel 9 and Channel",69
NA,10. They had about the same advertising,69
NA,and the same strength. Their market,69
NA,reach was slightly different under the old,69
NA,"rules. If I remember rightly, Channel 9 and",69
NA,10 had 42 per cent of the market and,69
NA,to Channel 7 had about 31 per cent. They were,69
NA,basically equal and were competing strongly.,69
NA,detect the I remind the House of that.,69
NA,I remind Government members of the,69
NA,that were introduced at that time by,69
NA,"for Mr Duffy, who announced when introducing",69
NA,This is a historic Bill because it provides the,69
NA,framework for a major expansion of the,69
NA,won the Australian broadcasting system.,69
NA,He thcen went .on to expound the advantages,69
NA,of all of these contrivances the Government,69
NA,had put together in the guise of a brand new,70
NA,era for the Australian media and media,70
NA,"ownership. In that day, there was also equal",70
NA,diversity amongst the major players in the,70
NA,"print media. In the radio field, there was also",70
NA,great diversity.,70
NA,Mr Jull-Huge diversity.,70
Mr CADMAN,Huge diversity that is no,70
NA,longer present. Despite all the machinations,70
NA,"of the Government, of the Caucus meetings,",70
NA,and of the Caucus committees-the chairmen,70
NA,of which expound their views from day to day,70
NA,on the media-despite all of that effort and,70
NA,"hype, the Prime Minister and the then Treas-",70
NA,urer have had their way and we are in the,70
NA,same process right at this minute. The signals,70
NA,are there. If the community want to know,70
NA,"what the Caucus is fearful of, they only need",70
NA,to read between the lines of what is being,70
NA,said by Caucus spokesmen and the chairmen,70
NA,of Caucus committees. What they keep under-,70
NA,scoring and what they keep emphasising is,70
NA,the very thing that they are fearful that the,70
NA,"Government may do; that is, change the rules.",70
NA,They know the results that that has brought,70
NA,about in the past. They are most concerned,70
NA,"that this process, of which this legislation we",70
NA,are debating tonight is part and which they,70
NA,"have become used to, will be continued by",70
NA,the current Government.,70
NA,We have seen the new players on the field,70
NA,"come and go, and the new players in radio are",70
NA,"Mike Willesee, Rod Muir and Glenn",70
NA,Wheat'ey. They have all changed their invest-,70
NA,ments and they have gone looking basically,70
NA,in other places for their returns. Led by the,70
NA,"Prime Minister, the Government has, where",70
NA,"it could, aligned itself with friends and has",70
NA,supported those friends. The words of the,70
NA,"then Treasurer, when he spoke to journalists",70
NA,"or proprietors, are notorious throughout the",70
NA,media industry of Australia-deals. Just a,70
NA,series of deals. No policy. No real objective,70
NA,for improving the choice for the Australian,70
NA,people. No real objectives for providing better,70
NA,services to country areas. There is just auto-,70
NA,matic acceptance of what the network carries,70
NA,and that that is good enough for rural,70
NA,Australia.,70
NA,The Caucus committee has been active over,70
NA,the last few days and made a great decision,70
NA,today-that it would stay right out of it.,70
NA,When the bids are in and when everybody,70
NA,knows who the main contenders for the,70
NA,"Fairfax groups are, the Government and the",70
NA,"Caucus will decide. Surprise, surprise I So,",70
NA,"again, we see the whole framework for a deal",70
NA,being set up.,70
NA,The current Bill is about cross-media,70
NA,ownership and there are four objectives of,70
NA,"that new proposal in the Bill. Firstly, the Bill",70
NA,extends the definition of associations requir-,70
NA,ing notification. There is a retrospective,70
NA,element in this which goes back five years.,70
NA,This is in line with the taxation rules on,70
NA,"associates. Therefore, it has a wider implica-",70
NA,"tion and there is an effect that will, in the",70
NA,"future, have some influence on the way in",70
NA,which governments and the Tribunal or the,70
NA,Trade Practices Commission will be able to,70
NA,look at these matters. The Bill extends the,70
NA,power of information gathering and puts in a,70
NA,new clause on confidentiality. There is little,70
NA,objection to that.,70
NA,The Bill also allows for at least 10 days,70
NA,notification before an acquisition which may,70
NA,breach cross-media ownership or foreign,70
NA,control rules. Is this a reasonable limitation?,70
NA,"Why the prior notice? Is it because, in the",70
NA,words of the Minister for Transport and,70
NA,"Communications ( Mr Beazley), he is not",70
NA,going to fool around; he wants a quick deci-,70
NA,sion; and so 10 days notice to have a chat to,70
NA,the Chairman of the Tribunal is enough? I,70
NA,remind the House that the Chairman is a,70
NA,former secretary of the ALP in New South,70
NA,"Wales, so it is a cosy relationship that we are",70
NA,talking about. The advice was given to the,70
NA,Government by one of its own former mem-,70
NA,bers and a long term expert in this area of,70
NA,media. This Government has a penchant for,70
NA,doing deals with its friends and trying to,70
NA,influence the results of decisions.,70
NA,"Finally, if the Tribunal expresses concern",70
NA,about any matter there is the reserve power,70
NA,for the Tribunal to send the matter off to the,70
NA,Federal Court. That threat would be enough,70
NA,to frighten a number of contenders out of the,70
NA,"field. In the words of the Minister, Caucus",70
NA,"members and the Prime Minister, it appears",70
NA,that there can be only one clean result for all,70
NA,of this process of the acquisition of Fairfax,70
NA,and that would be to give it to AIN because,71
NA,the favouritism that has been expressed,71
NA,other two major contenders would lead me to,71
NA,"believe that, no matter which of those two",71
NA,"were chosen, the Government would be",71
NA,"somewhat sullied by that decision. So, if",71
NA,"Tribunal, the liquidator, the Caucus committee",71
NA,and the Government by cross-media ownerbuyers,71
NA,ship controls accept that AIN is the favoured,71
NA,"group, the Government will be clean. But",71
NA,"on the other hand, it decides that the Packer treatment.",71
NA,bid or the Irish bid are suitable-both of those,71
NA,organisations have had the generous blessings,71
NA,"of Senator Richardson, the Prime Minister and",71
NA,the Minister-,71
NA,Mr JuIl--Dinner at the Lodge.,71
Mr CADMAN,"Yes, dinner at the Lodge,",71
NA,easily arranged. I would like to take the,71
NA,House briefly through some of the comments,71
NA,of the Minister responsible in,71
NA,Despite what has been said by members and,71
NA,"Ministers, a report in the Australian Financial",71
NA,Review of 7 February stated:,71
NA,Mr Beazley would alter the Act so that the,71
NA,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal could more easily,71
NA,order an immediate divestment of either,71
NA,"prescribed interest in the television station,",71
NA,"station or newspaper, in the event of a contravenper",71
NA,tion of the rules.,71
NA,That is the first shot across the bows. It is,71
NA,"case of, 'Those are going to be",71
NA,on which I will play. If you contravene the,71
NA,"rules, I will bring in quick action'. The",71
NA,are those of cross-media ownership. Who,71
NA,does that favour? In the article,71
NA,Gray she went on to state that she regarded,71
NA,"that as giving a certain outcome, a certain are",71
NA,NA,71
NA,could advance his cause and how the Minister,71
NA,"appeared in this instance to be even-handed,",71
NA,although she came to the conclusion that he,71
NA,was not really being even-handed.,71
NA,Then on 22 April there was a report of,71
NA,Minister saying that there would be no change,71
NA,"to media rules. Speaking on Channel 9,",71
NA,Minister said that the Government had enactKerry,71
NA,ed the rules to spread ownership of media,71
NA,interests and to ensure that they remained,71
NA,within Australian control. He said:,71
NA,"It is very important, in public policy terms,",71
NA,judgments that have been arrived at correctly,71
NA,terms of the public interest do not get overthrown,71
NA,to the or in any way excessively tampered with.,71
NA,That refers to the 20 per cent foreign control,71
NA,"of television or radio stations, the rules that",71
NA,apply at the moment. The rules mean that,71
NA,"the foreign companies or Channel9's owner, Mr",71
NA,"Kerry Packer, virtually the only interested",71
NA,of media groups with the money to,71
NA,"pay for them, are excluded from the market.",71
NA,"if, So there again we have some hint of favoured",71
NA,We then go on to 9 September when the,71
NA,lO-day limit is discussed. Another article by,71
NA,Joanne Gray in the Australian Financial,71
NA,Review stated:,71
NA,The short time limit may be a boon to Mr Kerry,71
NA,Packer's Tourang consortium bid for the John,71
NA,Fairfax newspaper group. Bank lenders to Fairfax,71
NA,may be discouraged from dealing with Tourang if,71
NA,there is the chance of a restructured bid or a,71
NA,this area. lengthy tribunal inquiry.,71
NA,a similarThe Trade Practices Commission does not have,71
NA,time limit. . .,71
NA,"But we are talking about the Tribunal, the",71
NA,body charged under this legislation to decide,71
NA,the these things. The Minister said in passing,71
NA,"radio that, if Caucus wanted to allow more than 20",71
NA,"cent ownership, he believed there was",71
NA,"room to do it. So we have the favoured two,",71
NA,"a the Irish connection and, of course, the Packer",71
NA,"the grounds group, coming through.",71
NA,The Minister then made his point of view,71
NA,rules very clear by condemning AIN as an up-,71
NA,market group that he felt was in the front,71
NA,by Joanne running. He said:,71
NA,We are hauling it back from that so in a sense we,71
NA,automatically starting off by doing a favour to,71
NA,That was to recover ground after he had been,71
NA,so critical of that group. I understand that two,71
NA,groups have already been to see Mr,71
NA,"Westerway, the Tribunal Chairman, with this",71
NA,the legislation in consideration. The Tourang,71
NA,"consortium, which includes Canadian publish-",71
NA,the er Mr Conrad Black and media magnate Mr,71
NA,"Packer, backed by US investment house",71
NA,"Hellman and Friedman, has been to see Mr",71
NA,Westerway. It is my understanding also from,71
NA,another statement in another place from Mr,71
NA,that Weste-ay that the Irish group has also been,71
NA,in to see him with this legislation in view.,71
NA,This is a poor way for a government to do,72
NA,business. Why does the Government not set,72
NA,down some rules that everybody can see,72
NA,through and then stick to them? Why does it,72
NA,not put the Australian public in a position,72
NA,where they can have confidence in what the,72
NA,Government is doing in the media? The,72
NA,public do not have that confidence. They have,72
NA,seen the way the Government has played this,72
NA,game in the past and they do not like it.,72
NA,The principle that will apply in this instance,72
NA,is that a legal decision is due on 15 October.,72
NA,Caucus has put aside making a decision. We,72
NA,do not know what the Government is up to.,72
NA,"But, when the bids come in, the Government",72
NA,will be in a position to decide whether it,72
NA,favours that process or not. I think that is,72
NA,highly cynical and it is wrong that the,72
NA,Government has chosen to adopt that process,72
NA,with this legislation.,72
NA,Another thing that concerns me is that in,72
NA,this process it appears to me at least that the,72
NA,personal life of the Leader of the Opposition,72
NA,(Dr Hewson) has been dragged into it in order,72
NA,to demonstrate that one of the contenders,72
NA,be a friend of the Government. The ParliaI,72
NA,mentary Secretary to the Minister for,72
NA,Transport and Communications ( Mr Snowdon),72
NA,smiles. The timing is coincidental. It appears,72
NA,to me that there is much to be gained by,72
NA,decisions and the Government is in the,72
NA,process of making a decision. It would be all,72
NA,the better for Australia at large if the,72
NA,Government were to state clearly what it,72
NA,"intends to stick to, stopped doing deals with",72
NA,"its friends, provided a framework of media",72
NA,certainty whereby there are strong contenders,72
NA,and decent competition between those in,72
NA,field and in that way provided the services,72
NA,that the Australian people want. Part of that,72
NA,would be greater involvement of the Trade,72
NA,Practices Commission instead of the,72
NA,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The certainly,72
NA,Government should set the Tribunal aside,72
NA,from some of these decisions and leave,72
NA,to the body that is expert in determining,72
NA,"has interests, who has controlling interest",72
NA,who has an association. It should leave them,72
NA,to the people who are experts-not to the,72
NA,Chairman of the ABT and the ultimate threat,72
NA,of the Federal Court.,72
NA,At the end of the day the losers will be the,72
NA,people of Australia. They have lost a great,72
NA,deal over the last eight years. They have lost,72
NA,three healthy television stations. Some radio,72
NA,stations are going well and some are not. We,72
NA,have such a concentration in the print media,72
NA,since the finalisation of the affairs of the,72
NA,"Herald and Weekly Times that, no matter how",72
NA,good News Ltd may be-and I am not con-,72
NA,demning it-it does leave the thought in the,72
NA,minds of most Australians that too much of,72
NA,what we read comes from one source only,72
NA,and there should be a greater diversity of,72
NA,choice and opportunity for Australians to,72
NA,"determine their television programs, radio",72
NA,outlets and print media. The Caucus is not,72
NA,about that. The Caucus is about to bow to a,72
NA,decision that will oe made in the back room,72
NA,by the Prime Minister and a few chosen,72
NA,people of the Cabinet. That decision will,72
NA,follow previous decisions-the poor example,72
NA,of using media policy as a ploy in political,72
NA,game playing to keep a government in office.,72
Mr SNOWDON ,Northern Territory-,72
NA,Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for,72
NA,may Transport and Communications) (8.40 p.m.)-,72
NA,start by acknowledging the contributions of,72
NA,honourable members who have spoken in this,72
NA,debate. As I progress I will make particular,72
NA,comment on some of the words of the hon-,72
NA,these ourable member for Mitchell ( Mr Cadman).,72
NA,"Firstly, I thank the honourable member for",72
NA,"Dobell ( Mr Lee) for his contribution, in which",72
NA,he put these amendments in their proper and,72
NA,appropriate context. I endorse the statements,72
NA,of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr,72
NA,Elliott) on cross-media ownership. The logic,72
NA,of his presentation and his understanding of,72
NA,the how the ABT operates and how it will be,72
NA,affected by these amendments is apparent.,72
NA,I found the contributions of Opposition,72
NA,members somewhat confusing because they,72
NA,did not demonstrate a uniform view.,72
NA,The propositions which were put by the,72
NA,them honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith)-,72
NA,who and the way in which he argued them-were,72
NA,and very different from the arguments which were,72
NA,put by the right honourable member for New,72
NA,England ( Mr Sinclair) and the honourable,72
NA,member for Mitchell. Both the honourable,72
NA,member for Bass and the honourable member,72
NA,for Mitchell commented on the ALP Caucus.,73
NA,"In that context, as the honourable member for",73
NA,"Dobell observed, whilst the honourable",73
NA,"member for Bass got some parts of it correct,",73
NA,essentially he misunderstood-or was com-,73
NA,pletely unaware of-the process of Caucus,73
NA,this morning. The honourable member for,73
NA,Mitchell clearly had no idea. It might have,73
NA,assisted the House if they had talked to one,73
NA,another and at least taken a common line on,73
NA,"what they thought was the attitude of Caucus,",73
NA,because they presented two very conflicting,73
NA,views.,73
NA,Their contributions demonstrate the danger,73
NA,of relying on media reports about what Cau-,73
NA,cus does or does not do. Perhaps they should,73
NA,reflect upon this. I suggest to them that the,73
NA,best thing for them to do is to be patient and,73
NA,all will be revealed to them. In time they will,73
NA,understand what the Caucus says. They will,73
NA,"not find it out from AAP, which the honour-",73
NA,able member for Bass this evening indicated,73
NA,was his source.,73
NA,I note that in particular the honourable,73
NA,member for Mitchell referred to the nationali-,73
NA,ty provisions of the legislation. I advise the,73
NA,honourable member for Mitchell that the only,73
NA,changes to the nationality provisions of this,73
NA,legislation occurred in 1981. The Minister,73
NA,who was responsible at that time was the right,73
NA,honourable member for New England. The,73
NA,provisions which were introduced changed the,73
NA,qualification from a resident to a citizen. The,73
NA,person who came to be most affected by that,73
NA,was Mr Murdoch from News Ltd.,73
NA,"I ,suggest to Opposition members that,",73
NA,"despite their rhetoric, they need to understand",73
NA,what this debate is about. This Bill amends a,73
NA,"broadcasting Act, not a newspaper Act. If",73
NA,foreign ownership limits are introduced for,73
NA,"newspapers, they will be introduced not under",73
NA,the Broadcasting Act but under the Trade,73
NA,"Practices Act, the Foreign Takeovers Act or",73
NA,some specific Act which might or might not,73
NA,be drafted for that purpose. This Bill simply,73
NA,deals with the way the ABT and the Federal,73
NA,Court handle the actual or proposed acquisi-,73
NA,tions of prescribed interests covered by the,73
NA,Broadcasting Act. It is a Bill of general,73
NA,"principle, as the right honourable member for",73
NA,"New England demands, and it will be effec-",73
NA,tive in ensuring that the spirit and letter of the,73
NA,"Act are observed. Already, Mr Kennedy's",73
NA,actions give evidence of that.,73
NA,"I emphasise that, despite the view which",73
NA,"has been expressed by the Opposition, the Bill",73
NA,does not change the rules. This was com-,73
NA,mented upon in some detail by the honourable,73
NA,member for Parramatta. The requirements of,73
NA,the current Act will determine what decisions,73
NA,ultimately are taken. I assure the honourable,73
NA,member for Bass that those rules already,73
NA,"apply to any form of control-de facto,",73
NA,"indirect, or direct. This Bill will also allow",73
NA,the ABT and the Federal Court to deal effec-,73
NA,tively with prospective acquisitions of pre-,73
NA,"scribed interests, including acquisitions of",73
NA,actual control.,73
NA,I emphasise that there is absolutely no,73
NA,confusion surrounding this Bill. The amend-,73
NA,ments to the Act proposed in the legislation,73
NA,ensure that the provisions of the Broadcasting,73
NA,Act relating to cross-media acquisitions and,73
NA,foreign ownership and control will be respect-,73
NA,ed and adhered to. The Bill clarifies the,73
NA,procedures of the Australian Broadcasting,73
NA,Tribunal that intending purchasers and owners,73
NA,of broadcasting media will be involved in.,73
NA,The primary objective of the Bill-that,73
NA,undertakings be given to the Tribunal by,73
NA,parties concerned in order to facilitate avoid-,73
NA,ance of any contravention of the Broadcasting,73
NA,Act-unfortunately seems to have been,73
NA,overlooked by the Opposition speakers in,73
NA,their haste to raise issues which were com-,73
NA,pletely extraneous to this legislation. The,73
NA,undertakings in this legislation are enforceable,73
NA,by the Federal Court. Any breach of a court,73
NA,order to comply with the undertakings is self-,73
NA,"executory; that is, failure to comply with such",73
NA,an order is a contempt of court.,73
NA,In the 81f2 years of this Labor Government,73
NA,we have witnessed rapid change in the field,73
NA,of broadcast media. The honourable member,73
NA,"for Mitchell seemed intent, unfortunately, on",73
NA,indicating to the House that somehow or other,73
NA,this Government was responsible for the,73
NA,excesses of the corporate cowboys in the,73
NA,media industry. We would have to ask him,73
NA,"how. I would suggest to him, if he were here,",73
NA,that not even he could seriously believe that.,73
NA,Those people are responsible for their own,73
NA,"actions, and they are the ones who are respon-",74
NA,sible for putting the organisations for which,74
NA,they themselves had responsibility into the,74
NA,mess that they ended up in. I would suggest,74
NA,to the honourable member for Mitchell that he,74
NA,should not listen to or believe his own rhetor-,74
NA,"ic, because it clearly is a misunderstanding of",74
NA,the reality.,74
NA,It is worth stressing that over the last few,74
NA,years we have seen profitable broadcast,74
NA,operations become financially threatened,74
NA,through their entanglement with parent or,74
NA,holding companies. Despite the advent of,74
NA,"television networks, holding companies and",74
NA,conglomerates with complex ownership and,74
NA,"control structures, television licence-holding",74
NA,companies losing control of their cash flow to,74
NA,"contingent group liabilities and the like, the",74
NA,policy thrusts of this Government have kept,74
NA,pace with the changes we have witnessed.,74
NA,The other thing that we need to observe is,74
NA,that the Opposition is speaking from a station-,74
NA,ary perspective of recent moments in history.,74
NA,The Broadcasting Act of 1942 was amended,74
NA,by the Labor Government in 1987 and again,74
NA,in 1990. These amendments addressed the,74
NA,increasingly complex issues of ownership and,74
NA,control of broadcast media.,74
NA,"In this era of rapid change, one would think",74
NA,that it is appropriate that we review from time,74
NA,to time the processes which are involved in,74
NA,ensuring that media regulations are appropri-,74
NA,"ate, and from time to time that means that the",74
NA,sort of legislation which has been debated,74
NA,here this evening ought to be introduced.,74
NA,"Despite its cynicism, the Opposition needs to",74
NA,understand and comprehend that the funda-,74
NA,mental desire of this Government is to ensure,74
NA,that we have a strong and appropriate media,74
NA,"in this country. We accept and appreciate, as",74
NA,"should the Opposition, the importance of an",74
NA,"independent media, free of monopoly control",74
NA,"or excessive foreign ownership, with quality",74
NA,programming and local content that have been,74
NA,maintained under this Government.,74
NA,The extent to which genuine freedom of,74
NA,speech is maintained is a measure of our,74
NA,democracy and something with which the,74
NA,"honourable member for Mitchell, perhaps",74
NA,even the right honourable member for New,74
NA,England and certainly the honourable member,74
NA,for Bass ought to appreciate is a major con-,74
NA,cern of this Government and is a legitimate,74
NA,concern of the Caucus. The Government has,74
NA,acted to ensure freedom of speech and di-,74
NA,versity of media ownership in our society.,74
NA,These have been concerns of this Government,74
NA,during this period of rapid change.,74
NA,The amendments set down in this Bill will,74
NA,ensure that the spirit and intent of the Broad-,74
NA,"casting Act, as amended, will be respected",74
NA,and its provisions adhered to. Restrictions on,74
NA,cross-media ownership and on the extent of,74
NA,foreign interest being involved in the owner-,74
NA,ship and control of Australian broadcast,74
NA,media have been part of the policy initiatives,74
NA,"of this Government l;lnd, hence, the subject of",74
NA,"the amendments to ,the Broadcasting Act made",74
NA,previously by the Government.,74
NA,"It is the domain, after all, of government to",74
NA,"determine policy and to legislate accordingly,",74
NA,just as in 1981 the right honourable member,74
NA,"for New E-gland, as Minister, saw fit to",74
NA,legislate to change the definition of nationali-,74
NA,ty. It is the domain of the Australian Broad-,74
NA,"casting Tribunal, on the other hand, to moni-",74
NA,tor and regulate compliance with legislation,74
NA,relating to broadcasting. It is important to,74
NA,note not only that the independence of the,74
NA,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is crucial to,74
NA,ensuring that all players and potential players,74
NA,in the broadcasting media industry comply,74
NA,with the legal requirements placed upon them,74
NA,but also that the effective functioning of this,74
NA,Tribunal is important in ensuring the viability,74
NA,and efficiency of the industry.,74
NA,I might just make one observation. I did not,74
NA,think the -eputation of the honourable mem-,74
NA,ber for Mitchell was at all enhanced by his,74
NA,slagging off at the Chairman of the ABT. I,74
NA,"suggest that he might rethink his attitude, as",74
NA,some other members of the Opposition ought,74
NA,"to do, about people in public office who are",74
NA,working on behalf of the people of this,74
NA,country in positions such as Chairman of the,74
NA,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. If the,74
NA,honourable member for Mitchell wants to slag,74
NA,"off at him, he ought to do it outside. If he has",74
NA,"allegations to make about these people, he",74
NA,should make them outside and expose himself,74
NA,to the full force of the law. His was a gutless,74
NA,exercise which ought not to be seen in this,74
NA,"House, and I believe the way in which the",75
NA,honourable member for Mitchell approached,75
NA,that particular subject is something which he,75
NA,ought to reflect upon.,75
NA,One aspect of the role of the Tribunal,75
NA,concerns broadcast media ownership. It is to,75
NA,ensure that the Tribunal has the capacity to,75
NA,monitor and regulate effectively in the area of,75
NA,acquisition of broadcast media and of owner-,75
NA,ship and control that the Government has,75
NA,"introduced this Bill. Under the Bill, prior",75
NA,notification of acquisitions of broadc::ast media,75
NA,which may be in contravention of the Act is,75
NA,required of the intended purchaser. Such,75
NA,notification will ensure that intended or actual,75
NA,ownership changes are brought to the atten-,75
NA,tion of the Tribunal. It will also assist the,75
NA,purchasers to avoid breaches of the Act.,75
NA,The ability of the Tribunal to fulfil inde-,75
NA,pendently and effectively its function qf,75
NA,granting approvals in relation to ownership,75
NA,and control of licences will be streamlined,75
NA,and strengthened by the legislation. The,75
NA,Tribunal will gain increased power to gather,75
NA,information relevant to any inquiry it deems,75
NA,may be necessary to investigate further mat-,75
NA,"tersof acquisition, ownership and control that",75
NA,may be in contravention of the Act. The,75
NA,Government considers it is of paramount,75
NA,importance that the Tribunal be vested with,75
NA,the necessary powers to carry out its functions,75
NA,properly.,75
NA,As with other initiatives of this Govern-,75
NA,"ment, safeguards to protect individuals are",75
NA,properly and appropriately being put in place.,75
NA,The Tribunal will not be able to make public,75
NA,information of or about a prospective broad-,75
NA,"cast media ownership transaction, and any",75
NA,information that would give a business com-,75
NA,petitor an unfair advantage could not be dis-,75
NA,closed by the Tribunal. These provisions of,75
NA,the Bill will go a long way to ensuring that,75
NA,"the functions of the ABT, described in section",75
NA,"16 of the Broadcasting Act, can and will be",75
NA,conducted on an independent basis. The,75
NA,"Government appropriately, as I have said,",75
NA,"makes the rules, and it is the responsibility of",75
NA,the Tribunal to monitor and investigate,75
NA,"commercial activities of individuals, com-",75
NA,panies and groups associated with the owner-,75
NA,ship and control of broadcast media.,75
NA,"This legislation, appropriately, contrary to",75
NA,what the honourable member for Mitchell had,75
NA,"the gall to suggest, maintains the separation",75
NA,of functions of the Government and the ABT.,75
NA,It keeps the Tribunal at arm's length from the,75
NA,"Government, as would be appropriate and as",75
NA,I am sure· is supported by the bulk of the,75
NA,Opposition if not by the honourable member,75
NA,for Mitchell.,75
NA,Clearly the Australian Broadcasting Tribu-,75
NA,nal is the proper body for investigating the,75
NA,compliance with or contravention of cross-,75
NA,media and foreign ownership provisions of the,75
NA,Broadcasting Act; the need for public,75
NA,proprietary of the broadcast licence holders,75
NA,"and their responsibility to accurately inform,",75
NA,to entertain and to meet social and cultural,75
NA,needs of their media audience have long been,75
NA,established. Ensuring that the body which is,75
NA,"responsible for the monitoring of licences,",75
NA,programs and standards is the same body that,75
NA,monitors and regulates in relation to acquisi-,75
NA,"tion, ownership and control not only makes",75
NA,for an efficient system of public accountabili-,75
NA,ty but also makes for one with sufficient,75
NA,powers to effectively achieve the objectives,75
NA,relating to the public good to which I have,75
NA,referred.,75
NA,A further important aspect of this Broad-,75
NA,casting Amendment Bill addresses the ques-,75
NA,tion of who constitutes an associate in the,75
NA,context of media ownership and control. I,75
NA,stress that it is not the intention of the Bill to,75
NA,make it difficult for genuine players in the,75
NA,broadcasting field. It is iinportant that the,75
NA,inclusion of associate relationships in the,75
NA,prior notification requirement will restrict,75
NA,"contraventions to the Act and, indeed, prevent",75
NA,such contraventions by enabling the Tribunal,75
NA,to take action at an early stage of acquisition,75
NA,and ownership changes. This will allow the,75
NA,Tribunal to avoid the use of valuable re-,75
NA,sources on unnecessarily prolonged investigat-,75
NA,ions.,75
NA,"As I said at the outset, I commend the",75
NA,legislation and I thank honourable members,75
NA,"who have made contributions, though the",75
NA,contributions made by the Opposition mem-,75
NA,bers are not ones I would agree with. But I,75

Mr WILSON ,Sturt) (9.02 p.m.)-I want,76
NA,to take part in the debate on the appropri-,76
NA,ations for the Department of the Prime Minis-,76
NA,"ter and Cabinet, the Department of Finance,",76
NA,the Department of the Treasury and the,76
NA,Advance to the Minister for Finance because,76
NA,it is in these areas-particularly in the Depart-,76
NA,ment of the Treasury and the Department of,76
NA,the Prime Minister and Cabinet-that there is,76
NA,the responsibility for the development and,76
NA,administration of policies that relate to the,76
NA,maintenance and the stability of our whole,76
NA,financial system.,76
NA,I want to talk about a specific problem that,76
NA,has arisen for the electors I represent and the,76
NA,other taxpayers in my State of South,76
NA,Australia. All honourable members in this,76
NA,House would be aware that the State Bank of,76
NA,South Australia would have failed but for a,76
NA,taxpayer guarantee that has enabled the State,76
NA,Government of South Australia to recapitalise,76
NA,"that bank not once, but twice, so that it",76
NA,complies with the capital adequacy require-,76
NA,ments.,76
NA,Mr Beale-In the interim.,76
Mr WILSON,"In the interim, as my",76
NA,"colleague says. In February of this year, the",76
NA,State Premier announced to shocked South,76
NA,Australians that it was necessary for the State,76
NA,Government to pump $980m into the State,76
NA,Bank. Just over six months later when he,76
NA,brought down his State Budget he brought a,76
NA,second shock to the South Australian elector-,77
NA,ate by announcing that another $1.2 billion,77
NA,had to be pumped in to ensure that the bank,77
NA,had the appropriate capital adequacy require-,77
NA,ments.,77
NA,This was because it was now allegedly the,77
NA,bank that was under the formal supervision of,77
NA,the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential,77
NA,"supervision, whereas formerly it was appar-",77
NA,ently informally under that supervision.,77
NA,Inquiries are being properly conducted as to,77
NA,who had primary responsibility or some level,77
NA,of responsibility for determining the issue of,77
NA,prudential supervision. As a member of the,77
NA,House of Representative Standing Committee,77
NA,"on Finance and Public Administration, I took",77
NA,part in a very interesting discussion with,77
NA,representatives of the State Bank of South,77
NA,Australia when they came to talk to us about,77
NA,the bank's problems and the manner in which,77
NA,they were handling them. Arising out of that,77
NA,"evidence, it became apparent that the State",77
NA,Bank has a large number of subsidiaries. It is,77
NA,suggested that there might be more than 130.,77
NA,A significant subsidiary is a company called,77
NA,"Beneficial Finance, a finance company which",77
NA,has been borrowing money and lending,77
NA,money. It has been borrowing money by,77
NA,issuing public prospectuses and getting public,77
NA,"support. Its prospectus No. 65, for example,",77
NA,quite clearly had at the bottom of a paragraph,77
NA,the statement that the State Bank of South,77
NA,"Australia does not guarantee, nor does it have",77
NA,"any responsibility, for the debenture",77
NA,borrowings of Beneficial Finance.,77
NA,At the Committee hearings on the public,77
NA,"record, in public evidence, the present manag-",77
NA,ing director of the bank informed the Com-,77
NA,mittee that the State Government had not,77
NA,guaranteed Beneficial Finance's funding. I do,77
NA,not very much favour the idea of banks that,77
NA,are too big to fail or banks that cannot fail,77
NA,because they have behind them a government,77
NA,guarantee. I certainly have less favour with,77
NA,the idea that the risk subsidiary of a bank,77
NA,should not be able to fail if it enters risky,77
NA,business. It is stupid and scandalous for a,77
NA,government such as the State Government of,77
NA,"South Australia, whose bank would have",77
NA,failed but for the guarantee of the Govern-,77
NA,"ment and, hence, the taxpayers, to permit, let",77
NA,"alone urge, its bank to pump good money",77
NA,after bad into a failing finance company,77
NA,subsidiary. This is what is happening with,77
NA,Beneficial Finance in a way that is forcing,77
NA,South Australian taxpayers to make a present,77
NA,of what could be up to $1 billion to interna-,77
NA,tional and other money market financiers.,77
NA,"The bank's managing director, Mr Ted",77
NA,"Johnson, has challenged the correctness of",77
NA,this claim. Let me explain how the figure can,77
NA,be justified. In doing so I will outline some,77
NA,"of the evidence which he, and his offsider, Mr",77
NA,"Steve Paddison, gave to the banking inquiry.",77
NA,NA,77
NA,The retail debentures are a relatively small propor-,77
NA,tion of Beneficial's total funding. It is in the,77
NA,majority funded out of wholesale funding markets.,77
NA,"When later questioned on this topic, the",77
NA,"managing director, Ted Johnson, confirmed",77
NA,NA,77
NA,are a relatively small proportion of the out-,77
NA,standing liabilities compared with wholesale,77
NA,finance market borrowings. Though Mr,77
NA,Johnson was not absolutely certain of the,77
NA,"ratio, he said that it would be between 10 and",77
NA,20 per cent. He promised to confirm the exact,77
NA,"numbers-I have not heard yet, but I hope to",77
NA,NA,77
NA,supply details as to how much of the,77
NA,outstandings of Beneficial Finance are domes-,77
NA,"tic debentures or retail debentures, wholesale",77
NA,"funding market liabilities, liabilities to the",77
NA,State Government or other liabilities.,77
NA,"Ted Johnson, in the Advertiser of 3 October",77
NA,"1991, is quoted as saying that Beneficial had",77
NA,$450m in offshore debt. This represents 35,77
NA,"per cent of the borrowings, given that Mr",77
NA,Johnson is also quoted as saying that 65 per,77
NA,cent of its borrowings were domestic.,77
NA,If there were $195m owing on retail deben-,77
NA,"tures, this would represent 15 per cent of the",77
NA,total borrowings with the balance coming,77
NA,"from the domestic wholesale market, repre-",77
NA,senting 50 per cent or $650m. Much of this,77
NA,$650m would have come from overseas as,77
NA,our domestic financial markets are awash with,77
NA,significant amounts of foreign investors',77
NA,"funds, which has come about as a conse-",77
NA,"quence of this Government's high interest,",77
NA,high exchange rate policies.,77
NA,South Australian taxpayers should not be,78
NA,called upon to pay BFC's losses. The State,78
NA,J)overnment guaranteed the repayment of the,78
NA,bank's deposits but it did not guarantee,78
NA,"repayment of BFC's bonds, nor were they",78
NA,guaranteed by the State Bank. The debentures,78
NA,were not guaranteed; the money market,78
NA,"instruments were not guaranteed, so the",78
NA,"gnomes of Zurich, New York, Tokyo and",78
NA,even Sydney and Melbourne should not get a,78
NA,present from the South Australian taxpayers,78
NA,"because now, in a retrospective way, those",78
NA,debentures are being given a guaranteed,78
NA,status. The State Bank should walk away,78
NA,from Beneficial Finance.,78
NA,The question might arise: what happens to,78
NA,the retail debenture holders? If one looks at,78
NA,their prospectus and tries to study the latest,78
NA,"figures, it could well be that the retail deben-",78
NA,ture holders would be paid 100c in the dollar,78
NA,and then there would be no problem. Why,78
NA,should South Australian taxpayers be paying,78
NA,on the wholesale money markets interest at 4,78
NA,or 5 per cent above the borrowings of the,78
NA,bank because people lent knowing the money,78
NA,was at risk? They took the risk; they should,78
NA,now cop the loss. The South Australian,78
NA,taxpayer should not have to fund that loss.,78
NA,This raises the whole question of the effi-,78
NA,cacy and appropriateness of State banks. For,78
NA,a number of years I have been advocating that,78
NA,they should be sold. I am pleased that my,78
NA,colleagues in the Liberal Party Opposition in,78
NA,the State Parliament have said that their,78
NA,policy is to sell the bank. It should be sold,78
NA,now and not later. By its crystallising its loss,78
NA,"now and selling its books, if it has them, we",78
NA,as South Australians would get much more,78
NA,for it and we would know what we were up,78
NA,"for, whereas if we let it drag on, it will be",78
NA,by bankers who are more concerned about,78
NA,protecting bankers and the bankers' club than,78
NA,they are about the interests of taxpayers for,78
NA,whom they write blank cheques. It is in the,78
NA,interests of South Australians that the bank be,78
NA,sold now. Its land broking and land agency,78
NA,"firm, its merchant bank, its insurance",78
NA,company and all its other subsidiaries should,78
NA,also be sold. Who knows how much they,78
NA,have borrowed on unsecured risk rated high,78
NA,interest paper. If they go wrong-they may,78
NA,have; we do not know-should we as taxpay-,78
NA,"ers be paying, or should they be allowed to",78
NA,fail?,78
NA,My view is that the security of the,78
NA,"Australian financial system, let alone the",78
NA,"South Australian system, is at stake if we",78
NA,allow these high risk ventures that are subsid-,78
NA,iaries of banks to get de facto guarantees after,78
NA,the event when people are getting a high price,78
NA,for the money because of the risk they took.,78
NA,(TIme expired),78
Dr CATLEY ,Adelaide) (9.11 p.m.)-I,78
NA,would like to talk about the Treasury appro-,78
NA,priation in respect of the Treasury policy as,78
NA,we come out of the recession that we have,78
NA,been in during this y-ar. We are in the reces-,78
NA,"sion for two interrelated reasons-the first, a",78
NA,long term one and the other a short term one.,78
NA,"In the long term, it results from our being cast",78
NA,adrift from the British imperial economic,78
NA,system when Britain joined the European,78
NA,Community and the consequential need for us,78
NA,"to restructure our economy, which had been",78
NA,featherbedded by inefficient sweetheart deals,78
NA,by Opposition members when in government,78
NA,"over 30 years in airlines, tariffs for the manu-",78
NA,"facturing sector, the ports, the education",78
NA,"system, agriculture and the banking sector.",78
NA,"In the short term, it has been occasioned by",78
NA,overheating the economy in 1989-90 when,78
NA,"demand was growing at 8 per cent, supply by",78
NA,4 per cent and the current account deficit,78
NA,matching the difference by providing a 4 per,78
NA,cent current account deficit of GDP. There-,78
NA,"fore, the Government slowed down the econ-",78
NA,"omy with tight wage, fiscal and monetary",78
NA,policy. This slowdown unfortunately became,78
NA,a recession in the course of the calendar year,78
NA,1991 because of the rural crisis occasioned by,78
NA,run the collapse of markets for our stable products,78
NA,of wheat and wool and in part by the drought.,78
NA,It was further exacerbated by a downturn in,78
NA,"the international business cycle, which ap-",78
NA,pears to have an unfortunate eight year,78
NA,duration that is almost immutable.,78
NA,This recession has not been the worst,78
NA,"recession in 60 years, no matter how loudly",78
NA,the Opposition shouts this to be the case.,78
NA,Unemployment has not reached 10 per cent.,78
NA,Unemployment was 30 per cent in the 1930s.,78
NA,Unemployment in 1982-83 was over 10 per,78
NA,"cent. At this stage, on the basis of unemploy-",79
NA,"ment figures, we are not as bad as we were in",79
NA,1982-83. On the basis of falls in output of,79
NA,"economic production, there has not been such",79
NA,a fall as there was in 1982-83. This is the,79
NA,worst recession since 1982-83. It has been,79
NA,exacerbated by the international situation and,79
NA,"by the need to restructure, but the signs are",79
NA,now appearing unmistakably that we are,79
NA,coming out of the recession.,79
NA,Let us have a look at a few of these figures.,79
NA,It is true that they are volatile and there,79
NA,"appear to be some ambiguities, but if we pick",79
NA,our way through we can see the following,79
NA,"things. Firstly, we have made unambiguous",79
NA,"gains on the inflation front, to which I will",79
NA,return. We have also made unambiguous,79
NA,gains on the current account deficit which,79
NA,occasioned the change in policy two years,79
NA,"ago. In terms of outputs, there are some clear",79
NA,signs that we are now moving upwards in,79
NA,"terms of production. Take the housing sector,",79
NA,for example. Housing finance commitments,79
NA,rose by 8.1 per cent in July to their highest,79
NA,level since November 1988 and they are 53.6,79
NA,per cent above the trough of the recession in,79
NA,July 1989. It is true that building approvals,79
NA,fell back slightly by 1.2 per cent in August,79
NA,"after rising strongly by 17.3 per cent in July,",79
NA,but the trend showed a growth of 2.6 per cent,79
NA,for the second consecutive month.,79
NA,The Westpac/CAI survey for industrial,79
NA,trends showed expectations for new orders in,79
NA,the coming quarter to be at their most bullish,79
NA,for two years. Inflation expectations for,79
NA,December are the lowest recorded in the,79
NA,survey and labour shedding is also expected,79
NA,to slow. Retail trade rose by 2.2 per cent in,79
NA,July after a slight fall in June and over the,79
NA,last three months trend growth was averaging,79
NA,at 0.3 per cent. The Westpac/Melbourne,79
NA,Institute measures of consumer inflation,79
NA,expectations have now fallen to 4 per cent in,79
NA,the September quarter.,79
NA,Labour market indicators are somewhat,79
NA,"volatile, as would be expected at this stage in",79
NA,"the cycle, but the, August labour force",79
NA,statistics showed a record growth in employ-,79
NA,"ment of 106,000 new jobs. This also occurred",79
NA,"with a sharp increase in the participation rate,",79
NA,which is back up to 63.4 per cent.,79
NA,It is true that the ANZ job vacancy survey,79
NA,"is not showing any great improvement, but on",79
NA,the other hand the DEET index has shown a,79
NA,clear sign of having turned with an 18 per,79
NA,cent increase in the three months to,79
NA,"September, the first such increase in two",79
NA,years.,79
NA,Alongside that there have been two unam-,79
NA,biguous wins. One has been the current,79
NA,"account deficit for August, which came in",79
NA,"well below market expectations at $507m, the",79
NA,lowest since January 1988 and the second,79
NA,lowest since April 1984. Exports have set a,79
NA,monthly record for the third consecutive,79
NA,month and imports have fallen by 12.3 per,79
NA,"cent. The surplus on goods and services, if we",79
NA,"exclude repayment on previous debt, was",79
NA,"$696m, the highest on record.",79
NA,The overall picture that is emerging is that,79
NA,there has been a slight increase and improve-,79
NA,"ment in output, the current account deficit is",79
NA,unambiguously improving and the inflation,79
NA,rate is going down. The inflation rate is not,79
NA,just going down owing to the recession. If we,79
NA,"look at the previous recession, which, as I",79
NA,"said, was comparable in terms of output and",79
NA,"employment results, we see that the inflation",79
NA,rate in 1982-83 reached a peak of over 11 per,79
NA,"cent. It is now 3 per cent annualised, and",79
NA,prices actually fell during the first six months,79
NA,of this year. The recession has not alone,79
NA,caused the drop in the inflation rate. This has,79
NA,been occasioned by the continuing accord,79
NA,with the trade unions on wage restraint and,79
NA,the capacity of this Government to target,79
NA,expenditure in such a way as its programs are,79
NA,maintained but public sector spending re-,79
NA,straint is occurring.,79
NA,"Again, the current account deficit is not just",79
NA,due to the recession. It is not just a question,79
NA,of imports going down; exports are up. The,79
NA,character of the exports has also changed in,79
NA,two very fundamental ways. They are increas-,79
NA,ingly manufacturing industry goods and,79
NA,services. In the last quarter of 1990 manufac-,79
NA,tured goods exports exceeded the value of,79
NA,"farm exports, probably for the first time in the",79
NA,"history of this country. Similarly, the direction",79
NA,of these exports has changed very substantial-,79
NA,ly and over 60 per cent of them now go to the,79
NA,Pacific Basin trading economies. In other,79
NA,"words, we have now moved away from being",80
NA,an adjunct of any European economic imperi-,80
NA,al structure.,80
NA,The South K:orean market is now more,80
NA,important for our exports than the UK market.,80
NA,The east Asian newly industrialised countries,80
NA,provide a bigger market for us than the,80
NA,"European Community does. Very shortly,",80
NA,"probably next year, ASEAN will be bigger as",80
NA,a market for our goods than will be the,80
NA,European Community. There are plenty of,80
NA,"signs that our education system, our media",80
NA,and our business culture have recognised the,80
NA,need to shift the character and also the,80
NA,direction of our exports.,80
NA,I noted in a paper yesterday that Japan's,80
NA,economy actually grew between 1985 and,80
NA,1991 by one France. What a staggering,80
NA,statistic! The capacity of these markets to,80
NA,absorb our goods is undoubtedly huge and we,80
NA,"now witness our nearest neighbour, Indonesia,",80
NA,growing at nearly 10 per cent per annum and,80
NA,absorbing an increasing component of our,80
NA,manufacturing exports. Now that the ABC is,80
NA,"to reopen in Jakarta, I hope we will get as",80
NA,much news on Indonesia as we get about,80
NA,France-although I dare say that is wishful,80
NA,thinking.,80
NA,Let me turn to employment. Just as this,80
NA,"recession is not the worst in 60 years, so too",80
NA,the job situation is not as bad as the Opposi-,80
NA,"tion wants to represent it. There are 830,000",80
NA,"people unemployed, which is a tremendously",80
NA,bad statistic but it is not one million. This,80
NA,"Government has still averaged over 185,000",80
NA,"new jobs per year for the last 8112 years,",80
NA,"counting the latest slowdown, which is more",80
NA,than double the rate of job creation growth,80
NA,that Opposition members managed when in,80
NA,government. But our people are entitled to,80
NA,ask: what will be the rate of employment,80
NA,when this recession is put behind us and we,80
NA,go back into a growth phase? What can we,80
NA,reasonably expect to be a rate of unemploy-,80
NA,ment with which we should be satisfied?,80
NA,I note that the Leader of the Opposition,80
NA,Hewson) says that full employment is now,80
NA,somewhere between 5 and 6.5 per cent. It is,80
NA,unfortunate that probably sociological changes,80
NA,have produced an increase in the number of,80
NA,women seeking work and a small reduction in,80
NA,"the number of older men seeking work,",80
NA,leading to a participation rate which is up,80
NA,from 58 to 64 per cent. If a similar rate of,80
NA,"employment is achieved in the work force in,",80
NA,"say, 1992 as there was in 1964, just as there",80
NA,would have been an unemployment rate,80
NA,outcome in 1964 of 1.2 per cent in 1992 it is,80
NA,likely to be 5.5 per cent.,80
NA,"I do not believe, therefore, we can reason-",80
NA,ably look forward to a 1.2 per cent unemploy-,80
NA,"ment rate. We can, however, look to a sub-",80
NA,"stantial reduction, and we can assist it. Where",80
NA,will this improvement in employment take,80
NA,"place? Firstly, in export industries; secondly,",80
NA,in those industries benefiting from the 8.5 per,80
NA,cent reduction in interest rates which we have,80
NA,"already achieved; thirdly, by fast tracking",80
NA,"development projects; fourthly, by our infra-",80
NA,structure program brought on stream in this,80
NA,"Budget for building better cities; and, finally,",80
NA,in the city that I represent-Adelaide-by the,80
NA,construction of the multifunction polis which,80
NA,to my great dismay I note has been opposed,80
NA,by first the Federal Liberals and then by the,80
NA,State Liberals and finally by the State and,80
NA,Federal Democrats. This is the greatest oppor-,80
NA,tunity for job generation to present itself in,80
NA,South Australia for the foreseeable future and,80
NA,it is with great dismay that I have to report,80
NA,that all political parties except the ALP are,80
NA,prepared to dud it. I hope the citizens of,80
NA,"Adelaide, come the next election, are in full",80
NA,cognisance of the brakes that have been,80
NA,placed on employment generation in the high,80
NA,"technology, high capital and high value-added",80
NA,even products that the MFP represents. (Time,80

Mr COSTELLO ,Higgins) (9.22 p.m.)-,80
NA,"The Budget we are debating tonight, handed",80
NA,"down on 20 August 1991, is hardly eight",80
NA,weeks old but it is stone-cold dead. I suppose,80
NA,that is to be expected of a document so,80
NA,"vacuous, showing such a defeatist attitude",80
NA,"towards government, and that was found to be",80
NA,so dispiriting by the Australian public. To-,80
NA,(Dr night I want to ask a legitimate question:,80
NA,how valuable are these Budget Papers that we,80
NA,have been presented with? This was a Budget,80
NA,that the Government deliberately set out to,80
NA,hide. When the Government thinks it can,80
NA,make half a public relations exercise out of,80
NA,"anything it grasps it with both hands. Take,",81
NA,"for example, the supposed 12 March state-",81
NA,ment Building a Better Australia. Even the,81
NA,Government could not maintain the pretence,81
NA,that this was a significant document; even it,81
NA,could not maintain the pretence that it would,81
NA,make any significant contribution to the life,81
NA,of national policy in this country.,81
NA,First of all the Government tried to hide the,81
NA,Budget by bringing it forward to 3 p.m. so the,81
NA,Australian public would not be able to watch,81
NA,"it. Then it tried to hide it, of course, by doing",81
NA,away with all of the rhetorical flourishes,81
NA,which had been used over the Keating period,81
NA,"to try to attract public attention, the kind of",81
NA,"rhetorical flourishes that were made in 1987,",81
NA,that we were entering a golden age of eco-,81
NA,"nomic change, or in 1988, that they would",81
NA,bring home the bacon.,81
NA,I want to compare the actual outcome in the,81
NA,last year with the promises that were made in,81
NA,the 1990-91 Budget and ask the question:,81
NA,how valuable are these Budget documents?,81
NA,In August 1990 the then Treasurer was using,81
NA,words like these: economic policy has worked,81
NA,and is working; the faith of the Australian,81
NA,people exhibited in the Government at the,81
NA,election is now being repaid as the economy,81
NA,adjusts to a sustainable rate of growth. A,81
NA,sustainable rate of growth was what we were,81
NA,promised in August 1990. What was deliv-,81
NA,ered? Negative growth: minus 0.9 per cent of,81
NA,GDP. We were also promised that inflation,81
NA,would fall. Inflation did fall-not for the,81
NA,"reasons predicted in the 1990 Budget, but for",81
NA,reasons entirely unanticipated. We were told,81
NA,that the current account deficit would fall. It,81
NA,"came down, it is true, from $22 billion to",81
NA,about $15 billion. A falling current account,81
NA,deficit: a great improvement; we only lost $15,81
NA,billion on the current account in that year. We,81
NA,were also told in August of 1990 that employ-,81
NA,ment would pick up. Unemployment rates,81
NA,went from 6.9 per cent to 9.4 per cent. Or,81
NA,take this promise in the August 1990 Budget:,81
NA,a surplus of $8 billion. That is what we were,81
NA,promised in the August 1990 Budget. It came,81
NA,in at $1.9 billion. A surplus of $8 billion,81
NA,turned into $1.9 billion.,81
NA,I want to make a point here. The,81
NA,Government has brought in laws insisting on,81
NA,strict standards in prospectuses. When people,81
NA,raise money out in the financial markets they,81
NA,have to make accurate financial projections,81
NA,"about profitability, and if they do not they are",81
NA,held liable-not just the company directors,81
NA,but the accountants and everybody else. If a,81
NA,prospectus were put out in this country,81
NA,forecasting an $8 billion surplus and it came,81
NA,"in with $1.9 billion one year later, somebody",81
NA,would probably go to gaol because he had put,81
NA,out a fraudulent prospectus. There is no other,81
NA,word for it: the Budget of 1990 was a fraudu-,81
NA,lent prospectus. All of the promises that were,81
NA,made were dashed.,81
NA,I had a schoolteacher who used to say to us,81
NA,if we were not doing well that we should put,81
NA,our sights high and aim for an F. Mr Keating,81
NA,would have been much better to have aimed,81
NA,for a G in his 1990 Budget. Why? Because,81
NA,the Government failed absolutely to foresee,81
NA,the recession. What was the cause of that,81
NA,recession? This Government wound up,81
NA,"interest rates to dampen demand, as a result",81
NA,"of excesses in monetary policy in 1988-89,",81
NA,which meant that by January 1990 prime bank,81
NA,rates were above 20 per cent. They did not,81
NA,dampen demand-they washed away supply;,81
NA,they cleaned out small business. There was a,81
NA,52 per cent increase in personal bankruptcies,81
NA,in June 1991. Over two years there were,81
NA,"20,000 bankruptcies, not counting company",81
NA,liquidations or voluntary closures that did not,81
NA,end in liquidations. In unemployment they,81
NA,"washed away 200,000 jobs between June",81
NA,1990 and June 1991.,81
NA,We do not need a royal commission into,81
NA,the economy to inquire into who was respon-,81
NA,"sible for this, because the prime felons have",81
NA,themselves confessed it. The then Treasurer,81
NA,"said, 'This is the recession we had to have;",81
NA,we had to have it; we had to wash away those,81
NA,"200,000 jobs, we had to wash away those",81
NA,"20,000 people now bankrupt, we had to wash",81
NA,away all of those companies'. Even today in,81
NA,Question Time the Prime Minister ( Mr,81
NA,"Hawke) said, 'We recessed the economy'. We",81
NA,do not need to have an inquiry into who was,81
NA,responsible. They have put their hands up:,81
NA,'We did it-we were promising to you in,81
NA,AugusU990 that all was going to be hunky-,81
NA,dory; we were promising you sustained,81
NA,growth but the prospectus just seemed to be,82
NA,quite inaccurate and we brought on a reces-,82
NA,sion instead'.,82
NA,I ask the question: how valuable are these,82
NA,macro-economic projections when they can,82
NA,"tum out so wrong, and indeed tum out so",82
NA,wrong as a result of an act of deliberate,82
NA,Government policy? Let me make it clear,82
NA,that I take no glee from this. This rate of,82
NA,"unemployment, this rate of youth unemploy-",82
NA,ment where around 25 per cent of young,82
NA,people in their teenage years are looking for,82
NA,"jobs, is a tragedy for Australia. The economic",82
NA,prognostications of Treasurer Keating in his,82
NA,August 1990 Budget should be treated with,82
NA,all the seriousness of the prognostications of,82
NA,"Nostradamus. In fact, he ought to be called",82
NA,Nostradamus Keating because the projections,82
NA,that he gave in that Budget were purely,82
NA,"speculative, as it turned out.",82
NA,"In a way, this illustrates one of the dangers",82
NA,of Canberra. I think Government members,82
NA,throughout that year were looking at prosper-,82
NA,ous Canberra; they were driving around in,82
NA,their Commonwealth cars oblivious to what,82
NA,was happening in real Australia. Anyone who,82
NA,was living in real Australia saw what the,82
NA,"recession was doing, saw what the interest",82
NA,"rates were doing to jobs, employment, shop",82
NA,"closures and farms, but the people who were",82
NA,closeted in Canberra bringing on this reces-,82
NA,"sion, which they supposed was in the public",82
NA,"interest, were completely oblivious to the",82
NA,early warning signs.,82
NA,It is absolutely clear that out of a failure,82
NA,this Government came and tried to bury its,82
NA,"own Budget. I come not to praise this Budget,",82
NA,"I come to bury it, because if one looks at this",82
NA,Budget one will see no coherent plan to,82
NA,"increase business investment, no coherent plan",82
NA,"to make manufacturing more productive, no",82
NA,"coherent plan to create jobs, no coherent plan",82
NA,to stop farm closures and no coherent plan to,82
NA,"stop bankruptcies. One cannot say, 'This is",82
NA,"where we will attract business investment, this",82
NA,"is where we will create jobs, this is how we",82
NA,will make manufacturing more productive or,82
NA,this is how we will cut down a raft of regula-,82
NA,tions that hold back business in this country'.,82
NA,"There is no plan, there is nothing in there. It",82
NA,is a defeatist and dispiriting document which,82
NA,the people of Australia will treat with utter,82
NA,despair.,82
NA,"Although the last speaker, the honourable",82
NA,"member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), got up and",82
NA,"said, 'We will do this by fast tracking propo-",82
NA,"sals and developments', was there any state-",82
NA,ment about that in this Budget? Was there,82
NA,any plan as to how that was to be done?,82
NA,"Although the last speaker said, 'We will",82
NA,"create a climate for business investment', was",82
NA,"there any plan, anything significant, anything",82
NA,hard or anything concrete in this particular,82
NA,Budget in that respect? This is an attitude,82
NA,which says that we can bring in a Budget,82
NA,"which says nothing, and so hedge it around",82
NA,with all these fine promises that we can try to,82
NA,put some kind of gloss on our completely,82
NA,defeatist approach to public policy in this,82
NA,"country, some kind of gloss of policy making",82
NA,through press statements that we might do this,82
NA,"or that, this faction might do this, or the",82
NA,ACTU might do this. There is no coherent,82
NA,policy or no coherent work in this particular,82
NA,Budget.,82
NA,This is a sad Budget for Australia; it is a,82
NA,dispiriting Budget for Australia. It is a vacu-,82
NA,"ous document which has no plan, and it is a",82
NA,document which holds out no future and no,82
NA,hope for all those who have suffered under,82
NA,the maladministration of this Government in,82
NA,the last 12 months.,82
Mr LANGMORE ,Fraser) (9.32 p.m.)-It,82
NA,is a pity that 'Mark Antony' on the other side,82
NA,can express such concern about the unem-,82
NA,ployed but that his leader demonstrates none,82
NA,of the compassion that he claims to show. I,82
NA,want to use the opportunity in the debate on,82
NA,the Appropriation Bill (No.1) to speak about,82
NA,"one institution in the Treasury portfolio, the",82
NA,"Industry Commission, and about its most",82
NA,recent report on the availability of capital.,82
NA,I confess to this Parliament that for perhaps,82
NA,the first time I feel sorry for the New Right,82
NA,ideologues in the Industry Commission.,82
NA,Imagine their dilemma at being asked to,82
NA,investigate the availability of capital. Asked,82
NA,to investigate perhaps the most deregulated,82
NA,"industry in this country, what would be left",82
NA,for them to say? Would they break their,82
NA,tradition of making basically the same recom-,82
NA,mendations no matter what the inquiry or,82
NA,would they admit defeat and recommend the,83
NA,"Commission's dissolution? Unfortunately,",83
NA,they took the first option and are attempting,83
NA,to scrounge around for the last few scraps of,83
NA,deregulation which could still be left on the,83
NA,financial plate.,83
NA,The Industry Commission believes that,83
NA,Australia spends too much on private housing.,83
NA,It would like to impose more taxes on the,83
NA,family home to encourage us all to live in,83
NA,rented accommodation. Perhaps the Opposi-,83
NA,tion would like to endorse that recommenda-,83
NA,tion. What a disaster. One of Australia's,83
NA,greatest achievements is its high level of,83
NA,home ownership. We should be encouraging,83
NA,"more people to own their own homes, not",83
NA,less.,83
Mr HOWARD ,Started by the Menzies,83
NA,Government.,83
Mr LANGMORE,I am delighted to have,83
NA,"that support, and I hope the Opposition will",83
NA,continue it. This is a good example of the,83
NA,Industry Commission's New Right recommen-,83
NA,dations being in conflict with its own evi-,83
NA,dence. The only country mentioned in the,83
NA,Commission's report which has a significantly,83
NA,lower proportion of its investment in housing,83
NA,is Turkey. This is an important point. It shows,83
NA,"where the New Right agenda, the agenda",83
NA,espoused by the Opposition's new and arro-,83
NA,"gant leadership, will lead Australia. It will",83
NA,lead Australia into impoverishment.,83
NA,The Industry Commission wants to let into,83
NA,Australia any foreign bank that wants to,83
NA,come. As the Bank of Credit and Commerce,83
NA,"International scandal showed, even quite large",83
NA,banks can be very shonky. The Industry,83
NA,Commission would like to increase Australian,83
NA,"savings by privatising pensions, me'dical care",83
NA,and education. It feels that removing,83
NA,government support for these essential ser-,83
NA,vices would force Australians to save more to,83
NA,meet these expenses. This is wonderful New,83
NA,"Right economics, but would be disastrous for",83
NA,Australia. Where would the clever country be,83
NA,without government provided education? The,83
NA,Industry Commission seems determined to,83
NA,tum Australia into an impoverished Third,83
NA,World nation.,83
NA,The Commission wants to privatise the,83
NA,Commonwealth Bank and the Australian,83
NA,Industry Development Corporation. According,83
NA,"to it, the partial privatisations and comprehen-",83
NA,sive corporatisations that these important,83
NA,government agencies have suffered is not,83
NA,enough. It is not enough that this has severely,83
NA,damaged their role in promoting the public,83
NA,good in an industry characterised by oligopoly,83
NA,and other major market failures. The Industry,83
NA,Commission wants to nail them and any,83
NA,protection of the public interest into the coffm,83
NA,of privatisation. Now they must not just act,83
NA,like private sector companies; they must be,83
NA,private sector companies with the inevitable,83
NA,loss of the public interest parts of their activi-,83
NA,ties.,83
NA,These New Right scorched earth policies,83
NA,will leave Australia with the public infrastruc-,83
NA,ture of a Third World country. But the private,83
NA,sector cannot flourish without a first rate,83
NA,public infrastructure. An uncompetitive,83
NA,private sector will not provide benefits to,83
NA,Australia. Competition does not just fall from,83
NA,the sky; it depends crucially on the framework,83
NA,and rules set by government which are neces-,83
NA,sary to offset market failure. Remove the,83
NA,publicly set framework and monopoly takes,83
NA,ovet:. Over the 1980s the finance industry has,83
NA,shown the folly of relying on self-regulation.,83
NA,With deregulation the Government gave,83
NA,practically all the responsibility for allocating,83
NA,credit to the private sector. What did it do,83
NA,with this responsibility? It went on an irre-,83
NA,sponsible dash for short term profits which,83
NA,damaged large parts of the Australian econ-,83
NA,omy. Asset prices boomed in an inflationary,83
NA,delusion and then crashed. Credit was mind-,83
NA,"lessly poured into share takeovers, land",83
NA,"speculation, empty office blocks and empty",83
NA,resolts. At the same time manufacturing and,83
NA,infrastructure on which our real wealth de-,83
NA,pends were starved of funds.,83
NA,All the Commission can say is that the,83
NA,private financial institutions took longer to,83
NA,learn the new deregulated game than expect-,83
NA,ed. What rubbish. The private financial,83
NA,institutions understood the game and they,83
NA,"played it the way they wanted to, for short",83
NA,term profits and market share. They are little,83
NA,different now. The short term profits are in,83
NA,lending for housing and a select group of blue,83
NA,chip companies. Once again it is the essential,83
NA,expansion of manufacturing and infrastructure,84
NA,that is ignored. The Commission is basically,84
NA,mute on how to raise our investment in these,84
NA,areas. \,84
NA,"As an example of the Commission's report,",84
NA,it acknowledges the important role equity,84
NA,investment by Japanese and German banks,84
NA,plays in their role as long term financiers of,84
NA,manufacturing industry. By taking equity the,84
NA,banks have a stake in the future of a,84
NA,"company, which means the banks will work",84
NA,"very hard to make the company a success,",84
NA,rather than selling it up as soon as it finds,84
NA,difficulty in paying interest. So where is the,84
NA,Commission recommendation to remove the,84
NA,Reserve Bank regulations over equity invest-,84
NA,ment? Nowhere to be seen. That is very,84
NA,inconsistent.,84
NA,One of Australia's major economic prob-,84
NA,lems is: how do we get investment in small,84
NA,"manufacturing and service businesses, invest-",84
NA,ment to employ our people and produce more,84
NA,"goods, goods we need to reduce inflationary",84
NA,pressure and expand exports? The,84
NA,Commission's report is a pathetic whitewash,84
NA,of the finance industry's continuing failure to,84
NA,meet this challenge.,84
NA,The Commission recognises that 'smaller,84
NA,listed companies traditionally have better,84
NA,performance over the long term' but that the,84
NA,large financial institutional investors stick to,84
NA,the top 50 companies. It recognises that,84
NA,financial institutions specialising in venture,84
NA,capital were basically non-existent before the,84
NA,early 1980s and are still inadequate. The,84
NA,OBCD recommends that venture capital,84
NA,investors should provide at least one per cent,84
NA,of market capitalisation. In Australia they,84
NA,"only amount to 0.1 per cent, starving new,",84
NA,innovative businesses of funds. Yet the,84
NA,Commission is content with starvation rations,84
NA,for the businesses which we need to build a,84
NA,strong manufacturing industry.,84
NA,Instead of recommending ways to increase,84
NA,"investment in small manufacturing companies,",84
NA,the Commission recommends destroying two,84
NA,of their rare sources of funds. Privatising the,84
NA,AIDC and the Commonwealth Development,84
NA,Bank will tum them into short term risk,84
NA,adverse institutions just like the rest of the,84
NA,financial sector. What the Commission should,84
NA,be recommending is that these agencies be,84
NA,"strengthened, not destroyed.",84
NA,", The AIDC and the Commonwealth Devel-",84
NA,opment Bank should have their activities,84
NA,expanded to include more management,84
NA,assistance. They should playa leading role in,84
NA,preparing the paperwork for start-up and small,84
NA,companies to approach commercial lenders.,84
NA,They should be directly involved in financing,84
NA,and managerial assistance to new firms in,84
NA,"depressed regions, particularly where tariff",84
NA,reductions are closing existing industries.,84
NA,Government needs to support this with direct,84
NA,funds and with loan guarantees.,84
NA,The Industry Commission's Panglossian,84
NA,view of a rosy future if we just let the market,84
NA,rip is in stark contrast with the failures that,84
NA,market forces have produced in the financial,84
NA,sector. The Industry Commission has recog-,84
NA,nised some of the past mistakes in the private,84
NA,"sector, but it cannot bring itself to open its",84
NA,eyes to market failures in the present. The,84
NA,Commission has failed to recognise the,84
NA,implications of the oligopolistic nature of the,84
NA,finance industry. Competition in this industry,84
NA,cannot be taken for granted. It may well not,84
NA,be appropriate to return to the Reserve Bank's,84
NA,regulatory era. But it is appropriate that the,84
NA,financial industry be required to justify its,84
NA,deregulated freedoms in a public forum. The,84
NA,Martin inquiry has been performing this,84
NA,function admirably. But once that inquiry is,84
NA,finished there will be a continuing need to,84
NA,prove to the public that the financial institu-,84
NA,tions deserve their self-regulation. That need,84
NA,can be efficiently met by placing the financial,84
NA,sector more directly under public surveillance,84
NA,by either the Reserve Bank or the Prices,84
NA,Surveillance Authority. I have called for this,84
NA,"surveillance in an earlier speech here, and the",84
NA,Industry Commission report only reinforces,84
NA,my original concerns.,84
NA,The Government has been successful in,84
NA,"stimulating business investment, expanding",84
NA,employment-even with the present prob-,84
NA,lems-and reducing inflation. A large part of,84
NA,this is due to the many innovations and,84
NA,improvements that have been made in the,84
NA,provision of finance and managerial assistance,84
NA,"to innovative new firms. The AIDC, the",84
NA,"Commonwealth Development Bank, the",84
NA,Management and Investment Companies,85
NA,Licensing Board and the National Industry,85
NA,Extension Service are just a few examples. As,85
NA,"a Government, we must continue with an",85
NA,imaginative and targeted approach to building,85
NA,new businesses in Australia. (Time expired),85

NA,"than factual rebuttal and, if anything, gives",85
NA,rise to yet further doubts about his extraordi- problem.,85
NA,nary position as the only non-ATO member,85
NA,on three advisory bodies to the ATO.,85
NA,In his response Mr Leibler is dismissive of,85
NA,the influence of these advisory bodies and,85
NA,states that they are no different in nature,85
NA,"from, say, the Companies and Securities",85
NA,Advisory Committee. For Mr Leibler's edifi-,85
NA,"cation, I would point out that the basis and",85
NA,conditions of appointment of all of the com-,85
NA,"panies and securities advisory bodies, plus",85
NA,"their authority and responsibility, are clearly",85
NA,enshrined in parts 9 to 14 of the Australian,85
NA,Securities Commission Act 1989. In marked,85
NA,"contrast, neither the Income Tax Assessment",85
NA,Act 1936 nor the Taxation Administration Act,85
NA,1953 gives any specific legislative power for,85
NA,the advisory bodies to the ATO. This there-,85
NA,fore pins appointments and even mere exist-,85
NA,ence of the advisory bodies to the,85
NA,Commissioner's general administrative discre-,85
NA,tion without any clear legislative limit on,85
NA,their power or influence.,85
NA,Mr Leibler further argues that there is no,85
NA,conflict of interest for him as a taxation,85
NA,lawyer in being on these bodies. Surely he,85
NA,"cannot be serious, given his role through the",85
NA,1980s and back into the 1970s as an adviser,85
NA,"on major tax avoidance schemes, which is so",85
NA,well documented in his own words in his own,85
NA,numerous articles and pronouncements.,85
NA,The minutes of the national tax liaison,85
NA,"group meeting of 23 November 1988, as",85
NA,recorded in Taxation in Australia of February,85
NA,"1989, illustrate succinctly the dilemma of Mr",85
NA,Leibler's dual role. Item 14 states:,85
NA,"New tax scam, media release.",85
NA,Mr Leibler referred to media release No. 88/35 of,85
NA,8 August 1988. He regarded the language used in,85
NA,the release as offensive particularly as it was open,85
NA,under the law to distribute income to beneficiaries,85
NA,in the way the Commissioner was trying to outlaw.,85
NA,He and Mr Buchanan suggested that if there was,85
NA,a problem then it should be solved by a change in,85
NA,"law, not by administrative scare tactics.",85
NA,Mr Boucher noted the points raised regarding the,85
NA,presentation and language used in the release.,85
NA,"However, he said that the message was directed at",85
NA,the scheme practitioners not tax practitioners and,85
NA,to the extent that the release was threatening it was,85
NA,effective in countering the avoidance problem. He,85
NA,defended the use of administrative action that was,85
NA,available to him as a practical solution to the,85
NA,"Unfortunately, this dilemma over conflict of",85
NA,interest appears obvious to all except Mr,85
NA,"Leibler. Referring specifically to Mr Leibler,",85
NA,the Canberra Times of 31 October 1990,85
NA,reported:,85
NA,A leading tax lawyer and adviser to the Australian,85
NA,Taxation Office has defended statements he made,85
NA,in a Melbourne Age interview last month that he,85
NA,had once had 'no qualms' about advising clients on,85
NA,tax-avoidance schemes.,85
NA,Later in his response Mr Leibler does not,86
NA,deny that representations made by him in,86
NA,1986 to a senior level of the ATO led to the,86
NA,withdrawal of 700 standard letters sent out by,86
NA,the Melbourne btanch of the ATO to trustees,86
NA,of schemes taking advantage of withholding,86
NA,"tax arrangements. Frankly, I find his excuse",86
NA,that he wanted this matter dealt with in a less,86
NA,"threatening manner somewhat thin, particular-",86
NA,ly given the Martin committee's subsequent,86
NA,severe criticism of ATO procrastination in,86
NA,tackling withholding tax abuse.,86
NA,"In addition, I am astounded by Mr Leibler's",86
NA,claim in his response that he did not know,86
NA,that several companies of which he had been,86
NA,a director or secretary were named in the,86
NA,MCCabe-Lafranchi report on the bottom of the,86
NA,"harbour tax avoidance schemes, which was",86
NA,tabled in the Parliament of Victoria on 27,86
NA,May 1982. The report received enormous,86
NA,"publicity at the time and was, in fact, the",86
NA,"subject of a special Age supplement, pub-",86
NA,"lished, I might add, on 7 June 1982, not 5",86
NA,June as I said in my grievance debate speech,86
NA,of 5 September last.,86
NA,Later in his response Mr Leibler failed to,86
NA,satisfactorily explain why in 1985 the ATO,86
NA,granted access to 90 per cent of procedure,86
NA,"manuals, guides and other documents sought",86
NA,under an FOI request by Arnold Bloch Leibler,86
NA,which a rather disturbed Administrative,86
NA,Appeals Tribunal found on 10 December 1985,86
NA,to be exempt documents the release of which,86
NA,would jeopardise the effectiveness of ATO,86
NA,procedures.,86
NA,"In his response, Mr Leibler also does not",86
NA,deny the essential facts of my assertions on 5,86
NA,September that he did attack ATO operational,86
NA,staff in the Age of 26 September 1990; that he,86
NA,did accuse the Martin committee of conduct-,86
NA,ing a witch hunt yet had been advising two of,86
NA,the 15 companies identified by the Martin,86
NA,"committee as major users of tax havens; and,",86
NA,"as chairman of companies Numinous Nos. 3,",86
NA,"4 and 5, did write to shareholders concerning",86
NA,capital gains tax arrangements while a mem-,86
NA,ber of the capital gains tax subcommittee,86
NA,"advising the ATO. Predictably, however, Mr",86
NA,Leibler disputes that these instances gave rise,86
NA,to any conflict of interest.,86
NA,Mr Leibler's attack on ATO staff caused Mr,86
NA,"Paul Tregillis, Tax Office Branch Secretary of",86
NA,"the Public Sector Union, to write to the",86
NA,Taxation Commissioner questioning the,86
NA,membership of the national tax liaison group,86
NA,of 'someone who has both attacked the staff,86
NA,of that organisation and actively assisted those,86
NA,working against the principal objective of that,86
NA,organisation'. It is important to note as well,86
NA,"that Mr John Thorburn, the crack ATO",86
NA,auditor in Melbourne who was moved not,86
NA,"long after Mr Leibler's attack, was at the time",86
NA,actually working on tax avoidance schemes,86
NA,involving interest withholding tax arrange-,86
NA,ments.,86
NA,"In his various forays into the media, Mr",86
NA,Leibler is prone on occasions to imply that he,86
NA,is speaking on behalf of the Law Council of,86
NA,Australia. One significant event at least,86
NA,indicates that the Law Council views Mr,86
NA,Leibler's erratic expeditions in a rather differ-,86
NA,ent light. In an article in the Melbourne Sun,86
NA,of 1 May 1989 and a radio broadcast on the,86
NA,"same day, Mr Leibler, ostensibly speaking on",86
NA,"behalf of the Law Council, slammed into Mrs",86
NA,"Barbara Smith of the Phillip Institute, of",86
NA,Technology for raising allegations about a,86
NA,particular form of withholding tax abuse.,86
NA,This involved the use of certain countries,86
NA,with which Australia does not have a recipro-,86
NA,"cal tax treaty, though this was partly misre-",86
NA,ported in the article as involving certain,86
NA,"ethnic groups. Subsequently, the Secretary-",86
NA,NA,86
NA,incisively dissociated the Council from Mr,86
NA,Leibler's aggressive remarks in a letter of 12,86
NA,"June 1990 to Minter Ellison, Mrs Smith's",86
NA,"solicitors. The letter said, inter alia:",86
NA,The remarks of Mr Leibler were not sanctioned by,86
NA,the Council. Neither the Council nor executive of,86
NA,the Law Council has given any consideration to the,86
NA,matter.,86
NA,"Furthermore, the Committee should be made",86
NA,"aware that, for her intrepid and outstanding",86
NA,"work on withholding tax abuse, Mrs Smith is",86
NA,to be awarded a Master of Business from the,86
NA,"Phillip Institute of Technology, the quality of",86
NA,her work having been independently assessed,86
NA,by one examiner from the University of,86
NA,Sydney and another from Monash University.,86
NA,"In conclusion, the case for an early parlia-",87
NA,mentary inquiry into the administration of the,87
NA,ATO is further apparent from what I have,87
NA,"said today. To that end, I seek leave to table",87
NA,certain of the various documents and articles,87
NA,"that I have referred to throughout this speech,",87
NA,which I have already taken the liberty of,87
NA,showing the Minister for Defence Science and,87
NA,"Personnel ( Mr Bilney), who is at the table.",87
NA,Leave granted.,87
Mr SINCLAIR ,New England) (9.51 p.m.),87
NA,-I really know nothing of the matters to,87
NA,which the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr,87
NA,Aldred) has just referred. I would like to,87
NA,suggest that there are problems in a tax sense.,87
NA,I want to take up what I see as an extraordi-,87
NA,narily difficult situation that is developing as,87
NA,a result of the protracted drought around,87
NA,Queensland and northern New South Wales.,87
NA,"As recently as Question Time today, the",87
NA,Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) suggested that,87
NA,Australia was bottoming out of its economic,87
NA,downturn and that the recovery was not far,87
NA,away. That statement has been echoed by the,87
NA,Treasurer ( Mr Kerin). It seems that this,87
NA,attitude has been picked up more optimistical-,87
NA,ly than realistically by a range of people in,87
NA,the business community.,87
NA,I think there needs to be some understand-,87
NA,ing that in rural Australia conditions and,87
NA,profitability are probably as tough today as,87
NA,they have ever been. There has been since,87
NA,time immemorial in this country a cycle of,87
NA,"droughts. Yet, in much of Queensland and",87
NA,certainly northern New South Wales the,87
NA,season this year is as bad as many can recall,87
NA,since the recording of weather statistics. I,87
NA,know that the trees are dying in the llectorate,87
NA,"of Wide Bay, which is represented by you,",87
NA,Mr Deputy Chairman. This is disastrous for,87
NA,agriculture. People really cannot comprehend,87
NA,the prospects if there is no rain within the,87
NA,next month or six weeks.,87
NA,"In my own part of the world, the dust that",87
NA,we see in the sky of an evening is not the,87
NA,product of the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo,87
NA,which plague the Philippines. Essentially it is,87
NA,dust that has been blown into the atmosphere,87
NA,as result of the scalded earth from the drought,87
NA,that is extending across so much of the,87
NA,northern part of this continent.,87
NA,"Of course, it is not just the drought. There",87
NA,is also the problem of markets. The people of,87
NA,rural Australia have suffered extraordinary,87
NA,difficulties because of the way in which the,87
NA,world markets have contracted. I know that,87
NA,the Government claims that its efforts within,87
NA,GATT and the Cairns Group have been as,87
NA,forceful and as effective as they might have,87
NA,been.,87
NA,Mr Bilney-Rightly so.,87
Mr SINCLAIR,But the Government,87
NA,needs to understand that it has not pursued,87
NA,Australia's cause as actively as it might have,87
NA,in some markets around the world. I am,87
NA,interested in the response of the Minister at,87
NA,"the table because he would know, or should",87
NA,"know, that in the Gulf states we have let the",87
NA,Australian live sheep trade deteriorate to a,87
NA,greater extent than it should have.,87
NA,Mr Bilney-Not so.,87
Mr SINCLAIR,I am afraid that the,87
NA,Minister is wrong. I do not want to pursue,87
NA,this matter but I know that the Minister,87
NA,pretends that much has been done. Represen-,87
NA,tation at a ministerial level which would have,87
NA,ensured that our voice was heard was not,87
NA,made early enough or adequately enough.,87
NA,"Those opposite were prepared to criticise,",87
NA,"long before the Gulf war, the Government in",87
NA,Saudi Arabia. No effort was made to establish,87
NA,a personal relationship with senior Ministers,87
NA,"in that Government. In my view, the unfortu-",87
NA,nate veterinary bar on the entry of live sheep,87
NA,has been as much a product of misunderstand-,87
NA,ing at a political level as it has at a veterinary,87
NA,level.,87
NA,"I do not want to pursue that, other than to",87
NA,say that this Government has not picked up a,87
NA,drought strategy. There is a real problem in,87
NA,regard to international markets. This is not,87
NA,just a matter of GATT-it is a matter of,87
NA,particular bilateral negotiations in a range of,87
NA,markets.,87
NA,I want to put to the Committee that the,87
NA,third dimension of the decline in small busi-,87
NA,ness and the rural sector is distinctly a pro-,87
NA,duct of changes that have been introduced by,87
NA,this Government without regard to the long,87
NA,term consequences. I am not suggesting that,87
NA,we on this side of the Committee in some,87
NA,way want to move into a new regulatory,88
NA,mode. But I want to suggest that disastrous,88
NA,problems flow from the range of changes,88
NA,"which my former colleague, the former",88
NA,"member for Gwydir, the Hon. Ralph Hunt,",88
NA,identified about four years ago as costing,88
NA,"farmers about $1 billion a year. To my mind,",88
NA,today those changes probably amount to $2,88
NA,billion a year.,88
NA,"I want briefly to identify those problems,",88
NA,look at them and say to the Government that,88
NA,it is not just the cycle of seasons nor the,88
NA,difficulty of markets which plagues the rural,88
NA,sector today. There is a combination of,88
NA,macroand micro-economic policy. There is,88
NA,a problem of taxation. There is a problem of,88
NA,the withdrawal of and change in rural support.,88
NA,These factors have exacerbated the position of,88
NA,those in the rural sector to the point where I,88
NA,am apprehensive about the declining value of,88
NA,land and the declining security of assets,88
NA,before the banks. I am concerned about the,88
NA,"impact on rural communities, the professions",88
NA,and the services.,88
NA,"I am concerned about a situation which, I",88
NA,"would suggest to the Prime Minister, is likely",88
NA,to lead not only to a continuation of,88
NA,Australia's economic downturn but to an,88
NA,exacerbation of that situation to the point,88
NA,where there is going to be more unemploy-,88
NA,"ment, where the vying force of the rural",88
NA,sector is going to be so restricted that many,88
NA,family farmers are going to be forced off the,88
NA,land and there is going to be nobody to take,88
NA,over.,88
NA,It is all very well saying that agriculture,88
NA,does not matter. I have heard Government,88
NA,Ministers say that today the rural sector,88
NA,exports make up no more than 26 per cent of,88
NA,the total. This is about half of what it was,88
NA,so many years ago. It is no use saying either,88
NA,that the number of those working in agricul-,88
NA,ture has declined. Of course it has.,88
NA,But we need to understand the potential for,88
NA,recovery in the rural sector-the potential for,88
NA,"being able to increase our export earnings, not",88
NA,just in the value-added sector but in terms of,88
NA,diversification into new industry such as,88
NA,aquiculture and the extent to which other,88
NA,agricultural industries and commodity-related,88
NA,industries can contribute to reduce Australia's,88
NA,burden of overseas debt and improve our,88
NA,"balance of payments. This is significant today,",88
NA,provided that those who are currently produc-,88
NA,ers are able to survive.,88
NA,"Briefly, the range of areas where the",88
NA,Government-induced intrusion on the produc-,88
NA,tive sector has affected profitability includes,88
NA,the extent to which Government is prepared,88
NA,to listen to the vocal minority-the environ-,88
NA,mentalists. We have seen the absolute disaster,88
NA,that has resulted from the Wesley Vale deci-,88
NA,sion. We have seen the procrastination over,88
NA,Coronation Hill. We have seen the way in,88
NA,which the Government has not been prepared,88
NA,to accept the rational use of timber and forest,88
NA,resources.,88
NA,Whether it be the north Queensland wet-,88
NA,lands or whether it be the north New South,88
NA,"Wales forests, there needs to be a proper",88
NA,"balance between conservation, environmental",88
NA,control and the use of the resources of those,88
NA,forests. We need to understand that the price,88
NA,of that over-reaction to the environmental,88
NA,"voice is the loss of jobs, the loss of private",88
NA,sector investment and the contraction of,88
NA,opportunities within the towns that service,88
NA,those industries.,88
NA,"So, too, it is with farming. Because of the",88
NA,"tax averaging provisions, farmers who have",88
NA,had past good seasons can be faced with a tax,88
NA,liability in a year of extraordinary loss. In our,88
NA,banking system we have seen the way in,88
NA,which many people have been called to pay,88
NA,penal rates above those ordinarily charged in,88
NA,an interest rate regime which internationally,88
NA,is non-competitive. These are loans which can,88
NA,no longer be properly serviced.,88
NA,We have seen the introduction by the Labor,88
NA,"Party of a range of new taxes, from capital",88
NA,not gains tax through to the broadening of its,88
NA,"wholesale sales tax regime, through to the",88
NA,elimination of a range of tax concessions that,88
NA,used to apply for the productive industries.,88
NA,"We have seen, too, in the elimination of",88
NA,particular concessions for deductions in,88
NA,"agriCUlture, as in business, the extent to which",88
NA,"investment, particularly new investment, is no",88
NA,longer attractive. So we now have a run-down,88
NA,in agricultural machinery and in fertiliser use,88
NA,and an inability to maintain the productivity,88
NA,of our farms.,88
NA,I want to speak with great sincerity to the,89
NA,"Prime Minister and tell him that, unless he",89
NA,"understands the extent to which the drought,",89
NA,market conditions and his Government's,89
NA,"actions have affected the rural sector, the rural",89
NA,sector tomorrow is likely to be a pale shadow,89
NA,of itself. Our ability to service our overseas,89
NA,"debt, to contribute to export earnings and to",89
NA,utilise those large tracts of land predominantly,89
NA,"suited to the commodities, whether they are",89
NA,"minerals or agriculture, is likely to be such",89
NA,that there are going to be great wildernesses,89
NA,which are totally contrary to the long term,89
NA,interests of this country. It is within the,89
NA,Government's control to act upon them. I,89
NA,strongly recommend that he does not see an,89
NA,end to our iinancial recession until those,89
NA,circumstances are reversed.,89
Mr MOORE ,Ryan) (10.01 p.m.)-I,89
NA,support the right honourable member for New,89
NA,England ( Mr Sinclair) in his comments about,89
NA,"the rural sector. In my time, I have not seen",89
NA,a rural crisis of the depth that the sector is in,89
NA,"today. My father, who is still alive, said only",89
NA,last week that he had not seen a drought in,89
NA,Queensland of this severity since 1946 and,89
NA,that towns that the nation would know as,89
NA,"garden cities, such as Toowoomba, are now",89
NA,dust cities. The general impact of that is yet,89
NA,to be seen on the Australian economy. I am,89
NA,"quite alarmed at what is happening today,",89
NA,"especially in Queensland, in the rural sector.",89
NA,I am very pleased that the right honourable,89
NA,member for New England raised the matter.,89
NA,I want to speak tonight on the question of,89
NA,the Commonwealth Bank float. I have spent,89
NA,some considerable time watching the,89
NA,privatisation issue in Australia. I have spent,89
NA,a lot of time promoting the method of,89
NA,"privatisation, not the philosophy, because it is",89
NA,in the method that the taxpayers of Australia,89
NA,"get their benefit. As a consequence, it is very",89
NA,important to see what happened. The,89
NA,Commonwealth Bank was the easy float. It,89
NA,was always going to be the dead shock,89
NA,winner for everybody-no troubles about that.,89
NA,"To trace the history of it, we should remem-",89
NA,ber that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke),89
NA,"talked about privatisation, when it was first",89
NA,raised by the honourable member for,89
NA,"Bennelong ( Mr Howard) many years ago, as",89
NA,the cheap philosophy-the throwing away of,89
NA,the family silver and all of those sorts of,89
NA,things that went with it. As time went by and,89
NA,we saw the development of privatisation in,89
NA,"Europe and in other countries, eventually we",89
NA,were dragged along the trail. In South,89
NA,"America today, all of those rheumatic left",89
NA,governments of that fascinating continent are,89
NA,into privatisation; they are into balancing the,89
NA,Budget; they are into generally getting,89
NA,government out of the area of control and,89
NA,giving people a fair go.,89
NA,It took until this year to get the Common-,89
NA,wealth Bank up and going in this nation. It,89
NA,came about only through the collapse of the,89
NA,"Victorian State Bank. If it was not for that, it",89
NA,would not have occurred. The Government,89
NA,had to raise some money to payout its mates,89
NA,down in Victoria. Despite the fact that the,89
NA,"Prime Minister now owns a house in Sydney,",89
NA,he still represents a Victorian seat. As a,89
NA,"consequence of that, he had to have some",89
NA,regard to what the Premier of Victoria had to,89
NA,"say about it, even if some of the Ministers do",89
NA,not like him.,89
NA,"Nevertheless, eventually this float was put",89
NA,together against the background of ideological,89
NA,hatred that goes on within the Labor Party.,89
NA,When eventually it was decided to pass the,89
NA,"Act, we went only as far as 30 per cent, with",89
NA,the right-according to the prospectus-of the,89
NA,"Government, not the directors, to direct what",89
NA,the dividend is. That was a very interesting,89
NA,example of how the Government sees priva-,89
NA,"tisation. So, the direct control is still there.",89
NA,This privatisation ground away; recommen-,89
NA,dations came in. What were we going to do,89
NA,about it? Eventually we decided to strike a,89
NA,"price at $5.60. But no, the institutions did not",89
NA,like that; it might not be too good. So we got,89
NA,the wobbles up. We caved in and dropped 20c,89
NA,to $5.40 and eventually spread it around the,89
NA,community. But not really: we gave it to the,89
NA,institutions. Small investors got 400 shares.,89
NA,Customers of the Commonwealth Bank got,89
NA,500 shares. I have received innumerable,89
NA,letters from people who said that they applied,89
NA,"for 5,000 or 1,000-whatever it was-and all",89
NA,they got was 400 if they were not a customer,89
NA,and 500 if they were. Four or five weeks,89
NA,"later, they got their money back. So the",89
NA,Commonwealth Bank did not do too badly in,90
NA,relation to the holding of that money during,90
NA,the process of issue.,90
NA,To bring the Committee back to the differ-,90
NA,"ence between $5.60 and $5.40, that was worth",90
NA,$48m to the taxpayers of Australia. Shares,90
NA,were not placed with the small investors of,90
NA,"Australia, because they got only 400 in the",90
NA,main. A lot of people were excluded:,90
NA,"120,OOO-odd people got into the issue, but a",90
NA,lot more could have participated if the pro-,90
NA,"moters and the Government, in particular, had",90
NA,bothered to press the issue right to the core,90
NA,around Australia. But they did not. That is the,90
NA,anti-ownership bent within the Labor Party.,90
NA,It did not want too many people in this. It just,90
NA,"put out that 120,000 shareholders were far too",90
NA,many to service and it would cost the bank a,90
NA,"fortune, and that was not on. The shares",90
NA,should have been made available to every,90
NA,individual who wanted them and the benefits,90
NA,promoted.,90
NA,What happened when they hit the market?,90
NA,"There was an odd sale at $6.90, but in the",90
NA,main they were $6.40. Not too many went,90
NA,"through. Today they are $6.90, which is a",90
NA,good $1.50 up on what the issue price was.,90
NA,That great judgment of knocking it down,90
NA,from $5.60 to $5.40 cost the taxpayers just,90
NA,short of $50m. Yet we hear from these superb,90
NA,judges of the Labor Party so much about,90
NA,economic judgment.,90
NA,I express the hope that in the future some,90
NA,notice will be taken of the advisers that come,90
NA,into these things and understand market,90
NA,"pressures, rather than their being given away.",90
NA,"The prospectus, which took so much effort to",90
NA,"put together, would not have been possible",90
NA,without the Government guarantees that went,90
NA,with it. Without the Government guarantees,90
NA,that went with the sale of the State Bank of,90
NA,"Victoria, it would not have been possible to",90
NA,put that prospectus together under the new,90
NA,laws. So it is little wonder that the total all-up,90
NA,cost of floating the Commonwealth Bank,90
NA,came out at just a touch over $40m and,90
NA,"120,000 shareholders, which is a huge cost.",90
NA,This makes one wonder at the prospectus,90
NA,rules of Australia today and their relevance,90
NA,because the ordinary citizen who is going to,90
NA,subscribe to 400 shares is not going to plough,90
NA,through the prospectus and turn up such,90
NA,weighty knowledge as can the people who,90
NA,can determine the dividend or the Common-,90
NA,wealth Bank or the government of the day.,90
NA,The ordinary citizen really wants to know that,90
NA,that investment is reasonably put together and,90
NA,guaranteed by the directors of the company at,90
NA,"that moment. If that is not the case, all the",90
NA,rest is irrelevant in relation to investment in,90
NA,that particular corporation. I hope that some,90
NA,of the lessons that come out of this will be,90
NA,learned in the future because a large number,90
NA,of government enterprises will have to be,90
NA,"privatised, largely in the semi-government and",90
NA,"State sector. As a consequence of that, a lot",90
NA,of work will need to be done in terms of,90
NA,"pricing, capitalisation and market projection",90
NA,because the Commonwealth Bank has shown,90
NA,"that, without proper marketing and proper",90
NA,"concern for the realities, the taxpayers will",90
NA,miss out. A lot of the Australian shareholders,90
NA,who might have wanted to be in the float,90
NA,were -xc1uded because of the poor marketing,90
NA,techniques· that took place in relation to this,90
NA,"issue. In view of the time, I will comment",90
NA,later on this matter.,90
Mr CADMAN ,Mitchell) (10.11 p.m.)-I,90
NA,Just want to make a few brief remarks about,90
NA,two aspects of the Treasury operations. I draw,90
NA,to the attention of the Treasurer ( Mr Kerin),90
NA,the deplorable administrative arrangement for,90
NA,the Insurance and Superannuation Commis-,90
NA,sion and also the deplorable administrative,90
NA,processes of the Child Support Agency. Often,90
NA,this type of comment is left for the adjourn-,90
NA,ment debate. But I think this is too serious to,90
NA,be put off to a later hour of the evening.,90
NA,The Insurance and Superannuation,90
NA,"Con,tmission has been required by this",90
NA,Parhament to approve and make determina-,90
NA,tions on roll-over provisions for retirees. In,90
NA,"my electorate, many retirees or people who",90
NA,have moved from one job to another and who,90
NA,are dependent on their investments to main-,90
NA,tain proper records and part of their income,90
NA,have submitted to the Insurance and Superan-,90
NA,nuation Commission their returns as early as,90
NA,November 1990. To date many of those,90
NA,people have not received a final determina-,90
NA,tion. They cannot submit their taxation re-,90
NA,turns. They are on a brief from the Australian,90
NA,Taxation Office by word of mouth only-a,91
NA,press release from the Commissioner of,91
NA,Taxation-that they will not be penalised.,91
NA,That is not good enough for tax administra-,91
NA,tion nor for an important organisation such as,91
NA,the Insurance and Superannuation Commis-,91
NA,sion. The processes are complex and long-,91
NA,winded. With the requirement of self-determi-,91
NA,"nation, neither any insurance company nor the",91
NA,Commissioner is prepared to guarantee the,91
NA,outcome of the determinations presented by,91
NA,the Insurance and Superannuation,91
NA,Commission. It falls to the taxpayers to make,91
NA,"a submission that they do not understand, that",91
NA,they cannot vouch for and for which there has,91
NA,been an extraordinary and lengthy delay.,91
NA,Already we have reached the month of,91
NA,October and many taxpayers who should have,91
NA,completed their taxation returns by the end of,91
NA,August have not done so. Many of them are,91
NA,owed refunds. It is deplorable that the Treas-,91
NA,"urer and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer,",91
NA,the Minister for Science and Technology ( Mr,91
NA,"Free), have not taken action.",91
NA,The Chairman of the Insurance and Super-,91
NA,annuation Commission needs a bomb under,91
NA,him. It is about time that he got something,91
NA,moving. Elderly people in my electorate have,91
NA,had to wait on the telephone for up to half an,91
NA,hour to get a simple inquiry answered at the,91
NA,Sydney office. I have waited 20 minutes just,91
NA,to test the system. It is a common occurrence.,91
NA,"I find it easy to phone Canberra, to the head",91
NA,"office of this outfit, but not everyone can do",91
NA,that. I ask the Minister to take this on notice,91
NA,and to do something about it.,91
NA,The administration of the Child Support,91
NA,Agency is just as deplorable. There are people,91
NA,who do not want to be gathered into the,91
NA,bureaucracy of the Child Support Agency but,91
NA,have to fight to prevent the bureaucrats from,91
NA,grabbing them and putting them into the,91
NA,system. There is often a perfectly proper and,91
NA,understandable relationship between a separat- Through,91
NA,ed husband and wife where regular payments,91
NA,"are made by the husband, as required by the",91
NA,"wife, yet the Child Support Agency wants to",91
NA,interfere with that process-and it is difficult,91
NA,"to escape that. On the other hand, there are",91
NA,wives or husbands who have gone without,91
NA,"payment for months, yet the spouses have not",91
NA,"been pursued. In one case, despite my repre-",91
NA,"sentation and constant phoning, the matter had",91
NA,been neglected for four months. The wife had,91
NA,no income and the Department of Social,91
NA,Security made it extremely difficult for her to,91
NA,realise any return for herself and her two,91
NA,dependent children.,91
NA,The Child Support Agency has claimed that,91
NA,it has 40 per cent of satisfied clients. If I were,91
NA,running an organisation that had a 40 per cent,91
NA,"satisfaction rate, I would be very worried",91
NA,about it because I would not think that I was,91
NA,fulfilling niy duties properly. I ask the Minis-,91
NA,ter at the table to take to the Treasurer the,91
NA,imperative need for his personal intervention,91
NA,to see that this matter is resolved. The Child,91
NA,Support Agency Act needs amendment and,91
NA,there needs to be greater rigour and greater,91
NA,expedition on the part of those people respon-,91
NA,sible for its administration.,91
NA,Proposed expenditures agreed to.,91
NA,Attorney-General's Department,91
NA,"Proposed expenditure, $804,154,000.",91
NA,MrWEBSTER (Macquarie) (10.17 p.m.)-,91
NA,This is the first opportunity that I have had to,91
NA,"congratulate you, Mr Deputy Chairman, on",91
NA,your appointment as a deputy chairman of,91
NA,committees.,91
NA,I wish to focus my comments tonight on the,91
NA,Attorney-General's Department's programs,91
NA,which appear at page 106 of Budget Paper,91
NA,No. 2 under the heading of Other Services-,91
NA,Marriage counselling organisations and related,91
NA,"grants. In particular, I would like to focus on",91
NA,family an4 marriage counselling services,91
NA,"already funded, the need for additional fund-",91
NA,ing and the way in which additional funding,91
NA,should be applied. The coalition's policy of,91
NA,"June 1990 entitled 'Family and Action Plan',",91
NA,"released prior to the last election, stated:",91
NA,The family provides the most effective means for,91
NA,"the care and development of children, and a source",91
NA,of personal happiness and social support.,91
NA,"the family, the moral, spiritual, ethical and",91
NA,social values of a civilised society are passed from,91
NA,"one generation to another, so that there is a shared",91
NA,system of values and attitudes that unites a,91
NA,community and enables its members to pursue,91
NA,shared goals from a secure base.,91
NA,Each ye- at about this time I try to ensure,91
NA,that the Committee focuses on the programs,91
NA,and organisations that support this vital pillar,92
NA,of our society. Over successive years I have,92
NA,argued for increased budgetary allocations for,92
NA,"family counselling organisations, marriage",92
NA,education organisations and family reconcili-,92
NA,ation centres in order that the tragedy of,92
NA,marriage breakdown maybe minimised.,92
NA,Over these same years I have been encour-,92
NA,aged to see a significant boost to these types,92
NA,"of programs, and this year is no exception. I",92
NA,was pleased to receive a reply to a letter that,92
NA,I sent to the Minister for Justice and Con-,92
NA,"sumer Affairs, Senator Tate, prior to the",92
NA,Budget. His letter detailed a reconsideration,92
NA,of and an increase in budgetary allocations for,92
NA,this financial year. I had lobbied hard to the,92
NA,Minister for these additional funds. This year,92
NA,we will see a total of $16.672m directed,92
NA,towards marriage counselling services-a,92
NA,record level for such funding. I therefore,92
NA,commend the Attorney-General ( Mr Duffy),92
NA,"and his colleague, Senator Tate, for their",92
NA,"provision in this regard. Nevertheless, this",92
NA,funding is still far below what I believe is,92
NA,truly necessary to have a positive impact on,92
NA,marriage breakdowns in our country.,92
NA,Today the family unit faces pressures that,92
NA,perhaps have never been faced in years past.,92
NA,In addition to the insecurity that rapid chan-,92
NA,"ges within society bring, we are faced with",92
NA,high unemployment levels; record bankrupt-,92
NA,"cies, with 12,991 for the year ended June",92
NA,"1991; record numbers of homeless, with",92
NA,"estimates ranging from 40,000 to 100,000;",92
NA,and 1.5 million Australians living below the,92
NA,"poverty line. This year, perhaps more than",92
NA,"any year in the past, we need to be doing",92
NA,everything that we can to underpin the family,92
NA,unit.,92
NA,A very interesting longitudinal study on the,92
NA,effects of divorce on children was published,92
NA,"in June this year by Cherlin, Furstenberg and",92
NA,others and it highlighted some significant,92
NA,facts. This study was undertaken using a large,92
NA,sample of children from two-parent families,92
NA,in Britain and the United States of America.,92
NA,"In the opening paragraph, the writers say:",92
NA,"The research literature leaves no doubt that,",92
NA,"average, children of divorced parents experience",92
NA,more emotional and behavioural problems and do,92
NA,less well in school than children who live with both,92
NA,biological parents.,92
NA,The writers also conclude that just as much,92
NA,attention needs to be paid to the processes,92
NA,that occur in troubled intact families as to the,92
NA,trauma that children suffer after their parents,92
NA,separate. That is a very important point. I,92
NA,believe this highlights the need for early,92
NA,"intervention and, if at all possible, adequate",92
NA,counselling prior to marriage taking place. It,92
NA,is this area of marriage counselling that,92
NA,receives the least of all. Of a total of,92
NA,$16.672m allocated for marriage counselling,92
NA,"services, only $500,700 is to be directed",92
NA,"towards marriage education, but this",92
NA,"$500,OOO-odd still represents an increase of",92
NA,over 100 per cent since the 1989-90 allocation,92
NA,"for this type of service. That is commendable,",92
NA,however small the amount still may be.,92
NA,The findings of the study that I have previ-,92
NA,ously cited are supported by comments made,92
NA,"by Dr Don Edgar, the Director of the Institute",92
NA,"of Family Studies, as recorded in the August",92
NA,1989 edition of the journal Family Matters.,92
NA,Dr Edgar argues as follows:,92
NA,More services for families should be aimed at,92
NA,prevention early on in the process of family,92
NA,"difficulties, rather than only being targeted at those",92
NA,who have gone so far down the track they are in,92
NA,real crisis.,92
NA,Dr Edgar calls for a move from a top-down,92
NA,model of family services to a more sensitive,92
NA,"model which focuses on family resources,",92
NA,"advice when asked for, family information",92
NA,"access, and family enhancement skills-all",92
NA,very important areas. He bases his call on the,92
NA,Institute's findings that many of those in need,92
NA,of help do not know where or how to find it,92
NA,or they stoically refuse to seek help from,92
NA,family support services. Dr Edgar further,92
NA,argues:,92
NA,If we cultivated a community value of using,92
NA,resources made accessible to all families of expect-,92
NA,ing advice when a problem emerges rather than a,92
NA,"rescue from disaster, a real partnership of family",92
NA,and fonnal support might emerge and a real,92
NA,strengthening of family life might result. If policy,92
NA,"makers really want the best for families, they",92
NA,should seek more research infonnation on actual,92
NA,"on the family aspirations, the actual ways in which",92
NA,families of different types and at different stages of,92
NA,the family cycle manage to cope and function on,92
NA,"the resources they have, and to support and prevent",92
NA,damage to the fabric of family life.,92
NA,I heartily endorse Dr Edgar's comments;,93
NA,"however, I am very disappointed that the",93
NA,Government continues to overlook these,93
NA,prudent priorities. In every year the,93
NA,"Government fails to reassess its focus, thou-",93
NA,sands and thousands of marriages fall apart,93
NA,that otherwise might have been saved. It,93
NA,disturbs me that the Government can see its,93
NA,way clear to commit over the next five years,93
NA,"more than $8oom to the better cities project,",93
NA,yet cannot see its way clear to undertake,93
NA,essential research that would do far more for,93
NA,"the Australian community than some vague,",93
NA,ill-conceived and poorly timed public rela-,93
NA,tions exercise.,93
NA,"In conclusion, the Government should be",93
NA,doing more to support and promote preventive,93
NA,programs in marriage and family education,93
NA,and counselling. The appropriations for these,93
NA,"programs before us today are inadequate,",93
NA,especially given the current pressures of,93
NA,"family life, with dad out of work, mortgage",93
NA,payments that cannot possibly be met and no,93
NA,end in sight. There is no use denying that,93
NA,there are major problems here. We are spend-,93
NA,ing in excess of $2 billion to prop up families,93
NA,as a result of marriage breakdown; yet we are,93
NA,"spending a mere $16m, almost $17m, in",93
NA,"family counselling and a mere $500,000, or",93
NA,"a little over, in marriage education programs.",93
NA,One of the greatest needs of our society,93
NA,today-and this is coming out more and,93
NA,"more, particularly in the inquiry",93
NA,taken into the Family Law Act-and some-,93
NA,thing that all the people who come before that,93
NA,Committee in the public hearings are in,93
NA,"favour of, is marriage education and much",93
NA,more of it. (TIme expired),93
Mr LAVARCH ,Fisher) (10.27 p.m.)-I,93
NA,welcome this opportunity to speak to the,93
NA,Appropriation Bill (No.1) and to the appro-,93
NA,priation for the Attorney-General's Depart-,93
NA,"ment, as it follows very quickly on the heels",93
NA,of a function I held last week with the Attor-,93
NA,ney-General ( Mr Duffy) and the State Attor-,93
NA,"ney-General in Queensland, Mr Wells, with",93
NA,a cross-section of the legal fraternity in,93
NA,Brisbane. It was a very successful function,93
NA,and it provided a very good opportunity for,93
NA,practitioners in Brisbane to speak to the,93
NA,Commonwealth Attorney and outline some of,93
NA,the difficulties which the profession is experi-,93
NA,encing in Queensland.,93
NA,"The profession in Queensland, particularly",93
NA,"in Brisbane, has in recent times undergone a",93
NA,most extraordinary attack on the part of,93
NA,"Queensland Newspapers Ltd, the publishers of",93
NA,the Courier-Mail and the Sunday Mail. Over,93
NA,"a period of a bit over a month, the Sunday",93
NA,Mail in particular has run a series of articles,93
NA,which basically allege that the legal profes-,93
NA,sion in Queensland is completely composed,93
NA,of solicitors whose only aim in life is to,93
NA,enrich themselves at the expense of their,93
NA,clients. There also is a series of allegations,93
NA,that solicitors are engaged in dishonest prac-,93
NA,tice and that any complaint made about,93
NA,solicitors to the Queensland Law Society is,93
NA,summarily dismissed.,93
NA,While without doubt there are some prob-,93
NA,lems within the legal profession-and certain-,93
NA,ly the cost of justice is of great concern to,93
NA,"this Parliament; indeed, a Senate inquiry",93
NA,currently is being undertaken to look at this,93
NA,problem-I wish to set the record straight in,93
NA,relation to the work which the legal profes-,93
NA,sion provides. This is particularly relevant to,93
NA,one of the major Budget initiatives undertaken,93
NA,by the Attorney-General in the current Budg-,93
NA,et. That relates to a substantial increase in the,93
NA,Commonwealth funding to community legal,93
NA,centres. The funding has increased from,93
NA,$2.7m in the last financial year to $5.2m in,93
NA,being under- the current Budget.,93
NA,In a press release about this increase in,93
NA,"funding, the Minister for Justice and Con-",93
NA,"sumer Affairs (Senator Tate) said, among",93
NA,other things:,93
NA,. . . a recent study had found that community legal,93
NA,"centres were an invaluable resource for Australia,",93
NA,with volunteer lawyers providing an estimated $2,93
NA,million worth of free legal aid each year over and,93
NA,above the various government payments. The,93
NA,"dedicated staff at CLCs around Australia, along",93
NA,"with the volunteer lawyers, provide an accessible",93
NA,and friendly service to people in need.,93
NA,It is a subject which I feel very strongly,93
NA,about.,93
NA,Consideration interrupted.,93

NA,ADJOURNMENT,94
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,Hon. G.G.D.,94
NA,"Scholes)-Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I",94

NA,That the House do now adjourn.,94

NA,be put forthwith without debate.,94
NA,Question resolved in the negative.,94
NA,APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1991-92,94
NA,In Committee,94
NA,Consideration resumed.,94
Mr LAVARCH ,Fisher) (10.31 p.m.)-As,94
NA,"I was saying, the community legal cen-es",94
NA,provide a very valuable role. A centre whi-h,94
NA,"operates in my electorate, the Petne",94
NA,community legal service-of which I was.a,94
NA,foundation member in the early 1980s-1s,94
NA,"staffed by volunteer local practitioners, and it",94
NA,gives a free legal service to many hundreds of,94
NA,local residents each year. Despite the very,94
NA,good work which is provided by the legal,94
NA,"profession in services such as this, the attacks",94
NA,made by the Courier-Mail really have largely,94
NA,"been unanswered. Unfortunately, this has not",94
NA,been through lack of action on behalf of the,94
NA,"Queensland Law Society. Indeed, the Presi-",94
NA,dent of the Society has made repeated at-,94
NA,tempts to have this side of the profession,94
NA,covered by the Sunday Mail and the Courier-,94
NA,"Mail. But, despite undertakings by the editor",94
NA,"of the Sunday Mail, Mr Jack Lunn, no such",94
NA,right of reply has been given to the profes-,94
NA,sion.,94
NA,"There are some 3,500 solicitors practising",94
NA,"in Queensland. Of those, 1,900 are principals",94
NA,"in their own firms and 1,600 are employed",94
NA,solicitors. The vast majority of these solicitors,94
NA,"operate in small businesses. In fact, some",94
NA,two-thirds of that number are sole practition-,94
NA,ers; another one-quarter belong to firms with,94
NA,"two to four partners. Indeed, in Queensland",94
NA,there are only 16 firms which have more than,94
NA,10 partners. That indicates that the leglll,94
NA,"practice, at least in the State of Queensland,",94
NA,is very much a small business. It is my,94
NA,"experience, both from being a practitioner and",94
NA,"also since being a member of parliament, that",94
NA,the vast majority of practitioners underta-e,94
NA,"their work, their duties, to the utmost of therr",94
NA,abilities; that they try to serve as best they,94
NA,"can the interests of their clients; and that, on",94
NA,"the whole, their services are well regarded.",94
NA,"It is estimated that about 750,000 transac-",94
NA,tions are undertaken by Queensland solicitors,94
NA,"each year. Of that huge number, official",94
NA,complaints last year to the Queensland Law,94
NA,Society about the handling of matt-rs by,94
NA,solicitors numbered some 750-that 1S 750,94
NA,"complaints out of some 750,000 individual",94
NA,matters handled by solicitors. Despite the very,94
NA,strong inference at least from those figures,94
NA,that the vast majority of people are happy,94
NA,with the work which their solicitor does for,94
NA,"them, no such balance has been provi-ed in",94
NA,the attacks launched by the Sunday MOll and,94
NA,the Courier-Mail against the Queensland legal,94
NA,profession.,94
NA,The other argument put forward is that,94
NA,solicitors are grossly overpaid or that they are,94
NA,living high off the fat of the land. Undoubted-,94
NA,ly some do quite well out of the profession.,94
NA,But in the last financial year an average self-,94
NA,"employed practitioner within Queensland, as",94
NA,revealed by studies done by Professor,94
NA,"Meredith of the University'of New England,",94
NA,might expect a net income of about,94
NA,"$67,000-which I note is slightly better than",94
NA,"a backbencher of parliament. Nonetheless, I",94
NA,do not believe that is a particularly high,94
NA,"return for the amount of work, the effort, the",94
NA,training and the expertise which goes into,94
NA,"running a legal practice. Out of that $67,000,",94
NA,a sole practitioner is required to provide for,94
NA,"his or her own sick leave, holiday pay and",94
NA,any contribution to superannuation.,94
NA,"So, in total, I do not believe that on the",94
NA,whole the legal profession is overpaid at least,94
NA,in the State of Queensland. Undoubtedly there,94
NA,are some individuals who do very well in-,94
NA,"deed, and it is quite right that there should be",94
NA,some focus on the cost of solicitors and also,94
NA,"of barristers, of course, in terms of this",94
NA,overall debate on the cost of justice. But it,94
NA,should be a balanced debate-,94
NA,Mr Costello-What about Chris Schacht?,94
Mr LAVARCH,The sort of absolute,94
NA,rhetoric we see coming out of the Courier-,94
NA,Mail and the Sunday Mail does nothing,94
NA,towards providing that debate. I note that my,94
NA,friend the honourable member for Higgins,94
NA,( Mr Costello) draws my attention to the,94
NA,activities of Senator Schacht and the Senate,95
NA,inquiry into the cost of justice. I am very,95
NA,supportive of the work being done by the,95
NA,"Senate inquiry, particularly of its Chainnan,",95
NA,"Senator Cooney, with whom I have had",95
NA,"discussions about these matters, and I know",95
NA,he views them in a very balanced and un-,95
NA,biased way. Maybe not all members of that,95
NA,committee share his view of these matters and,95
NA,are a little inclined to seek the sensational,95
NA,"approach rather than actually seek the truth,",95
NA,but I would not be so unkind as to identify,95
NA,who that individual or individuals may be.,95
NA,"Nonetheless, on the whole I believe that the",95
NA,Government should be commended for its,95
NA,initiatives in the Attorney-General's Depart-,95
NA,"ment, particularly the increase in funding for",95
NA,community legal centres. They do excellent,95
NA,work and the substantial increase in the,95
NA,money which the Government has provided,95
NA,will go a long way towards reinforcing this,95
NA,very important provision of law services in,95
NA,this society. (TIme expired),95
Mr COSTELLO ,Higgins) (10.37 p.m.)-,95
NA,Last November the Attorney-General ( Mr,95
NA,Duffy) rushed through under guillotine one of,95
NA,the most complex and voluminous packages,95
NA,of legislation this Parliament will ever deal,95
NA,with. The day was 14 November 1990. The,95
NA,Bill was the Corporations Legislation Amend-,95
NA,"ment Bill, which introduced new corporations",95
NA,law into Australia. The Attorney allowed only,95
NA,"60 minutes for debate which, when broken",95
NA,"down, allowed 12. seconds per page of the",95
NA,Bill for all those entitled to speak. The Bill,95
NA,had taken three full years to get to the,95
NA,Parliament. This House caught a glimpse of,95
NA,it for about 60 minutes. In the debate on that,95
NA,"Bill, I said that in years to come a plethora",95
NA,loopholes and drafting errors would come to,95
NA,light as a result of the absence of any real,95
NA,parliamentary scrutiny. In the 11 or so months,95
NA,"since the legislation passed this House, I am",95
NA,sorry to report that my fears have material-,95
NA,ised. The Attorney has already come back,95
NA,into this House with an amendment Bill to fix,95
NA,"aspects of the original package, and he will",95
NA,need to come back again.,95
NA,The requirement that a nine-digit Australian,95
NA,company number be printed on all business,95
NA,"letters, statements of account, invoices, re-",95
NA,"ceipts, orders for goods, official notices or",95
NA,publications is plainly ridiculous and the law,95
NA,in that respect will have to be changed. For,95
NA,"example, real estate agencies, which are",95
NA,corporations and advertise hundreds perhaps,95
NA,"thousands of properties for sale on a Saturday,",95
NA,would have to put their name and Australian,95
NA,company number on each one of those adver-,95
NA,"tisements, adding to the cost of advertising",95
NA,"but providing no real public utility. Shops,",95
NA,"which issue receipts to people who buy items,",95
NA,would have to issue a receipt with an,95
NA,Australian company number on it. Even the,95
NA,"local milk bar, if it were a corporation, and",95
NA,large supermarket chains which operate,95
NA,trading operations through different corporate,95
NA,entities would have to have separate cash,95
NA,registers with separate Australian company,95
NA,"numbers on all of their receipts, whether they",95
NA,be for the purchase of vegetables 01' milk or,95
NA,"whatever. Plainly, the current legislative",95
NA,requirements which have been suspended in,95
NA,operation will have to be amended.,95
NA,Plainly also changes are required to the,95
NA,fundraising provisions in the corporations law.,95
NA,"With their wide reach, the prospectus provi-",95
NA,sions potentially regulate secondary trading of,95
NA,private placements and screen trading and,95
NA,potentially forbid media reports on prospec-,95
NA,tuses. The provisions are not focused enough,95
NA,and they may inhibit equity raising in,95
NA,Australia.,95
NA,I had an example recently. Someone who,95
NA,came to see me had been told that the cost of,95
NA,putting out a prospectus was such that he had,95
NA,decided not to raise the equity in Australia,95
NA,but to borrow the money offshore. If our laws,95
NA,add to foreign debt as an alternative to paying,95
NA,"of the cost of raising domestic equity, they are",95
NA,not operating properly. These laws are now,95
NA,being examined. Why they could not have,95
NA,been examined in November last year is,95
NA,beyond me.,95
NA,"Last week, the Federal Court ruled in the",95
NA,Keydata case that the Corporations and,95
NA,Securities Panel did not have power to make,95
NA,interim orders in relation to takeover conduct,95
NA,which it was examining. The Victorian re-,95
NA,gional commissioner of the Australia Securi-,95
NA,"ties Commission, Mr Ron Trevethan, de-",95
NA,scribed the decision as 'a bit of a shock',95
NA,which placed in doubt 'the whole future and,96
NA,usefulness of the panel'. He said:,96
NA,If you can't preserve the status quo before a,96
NA,"decision is made, then what's the use of a panel at",96
NA,all? This is a very serious setback to the ASC and,96
NA,the panel itself.,96
NA,"I remind honourable members that this Panel,",96
NA,"which has had a bleak future, also has a fairly",96
NA,short past. The Attorney-General appointed,96
NA,members to this Panel only a couple of,96
NA,"months ago. The Panel itself, however, was",96
NA,constituted by the Australian Securities Act,96
NA,"1989, coming into operation in July 1989.",96
NA,The law that it was to administer operated,96
NA,from 1 January 1991 and yet the appoint-,96
NA,ments were made only comparatively recently.,96
NA,Already that Panel is requesting changes to,96
NA,the law. If it had been appointed some time,96
NA,ago this could have been clarified and fixed,96
NA,much earlier.,96
NA,This illustrates the confused state of corpo-,96
NA,rate administration. At a time when the,96
NA,Corporations and Securities Panel should have,96
NA,"been writing its June 1991 annual report, it",96
NA,was not in existence. The Companies Auditors,96
NA,and Liquidators Disciplinary Board had to,96
NA,write a report for 30 June 1991; it had only,96
NA,been going a few weeks. In an Estimates,96
NA,committee hearing we asked what the report,96
NA,would be and were told effectively that it,96
NA,would be one paragraph saying that in the,96
NA,year it had to report on it had had one,96
NA,meeting. This was not through any fault of its,96
NA,own but by reason of delays in the appoint-,96
NA,ments. this shows that there have been major,96
NA,problems in getting the system up .and,96
NA,running. I believe that ultimately the system,96
NA,"will be a better one than we had in the past,",96
NA,but the Attorney-General's Department must,96
NA,devote a lot of work and concerted effort to,96
NA,it.,96
NA,It is true that real resources have now been,96
NA,dedicated to the Australian Securities,96
NA,Commission. The Opposition has supported,96
NA,"that, but we must be vigilant to ensure that",96
NA,those funds which have been devoted are,96
NA,"being properly expended. For example, it is",96
NA,now said that 902 people in the Australian,96
NA,Securities Commission are working on en-,96
NA,forcement at a cost of $71.2m. I am aware,96
NA,that many of those people will be working on,96
NA,enforcement in relation to filings and so on.,96
NA,I am also aware that the Australian Securities,96
NA,Commission says that it has 205 matters,96
NA,under investigation or litigation. But has it,96
NA,really brought to justice the major cases?,96
NA,"With those 902 people, can we say that all of",96
NA,those who profited by breaching corporations,96
NA,law during the decade of the 1980s have now,96
NA,been properly investigated and brought to,96
NA,justice in courts of law? If we cannot say,96
NA,"that, we must raise the question as to whether",96
NA,we are getting value for our money under the,96
NA,current system.,96
NA,In this discussion of the appropriation for,96
NA,"the Attorney-General's Department, I wish to",96
NA,raise other matters which I think should be,96
NA,very carefully considered by the Attorney-,96
NA,General's Department. That Department must,96
NA,make sure that in its area of operation it takes,96
NA,a view that is conducive to public policy and,96
NA,overall economic development in this country.,96
NA,We cannot say on the one hand that we want,96
NA,to have economic development and get the,96
NA,Australian economy moving and on the other,96
NA,have an Attorney-General's Department that,96
NA,"introduces, administers or acquiesces in laws",96
NA,which may in fact be inimical to economic,96
NA,development and prosperity.,96
NA,I raise as matters of concern two issues,96
NA,which I believe will be very destructive to the,96
NA,operating environment for business in,96
NA,Australia if they should become law. They are,96
NA,the subjects of class actions and product,96
NA,"liability. I am aware, of course, that these are",96
NA,"initiatives of Senator Tate, the Minister for",96
NA,"Justice and Consumer Affairs, but he also",96
NA,operates programs out of the Attorney-,96
NA,General's Department and it is from that,96
NA,Department that these initiatives will be,96
NA,developed.,96
NA,The proposal to introduce neW product,96
NA,liability laws which are more strict than the,96
NA,European Community directive will make,96
NA,Australia a high risk manufacturing zone;,96
NA,there is no question about it. Those laws will,96
NA,be one more disincentive to manufacture,96
NA,products in Australia. They will not be condu-,96
NA,cive to the creation of a positive climate for,96
NA,manufacturing investment in this country.,96
NA,When we put them together with the propo-,96
NA,sals for class actions-to allow actions to be,96
NA,"brought on behalf of a class, the members of",97
NA,which are not identified and have not indicat-,97
NA,ed their support to be part of an action-we,97
NA,are putting together the opportunity for,97
NA,widespread litigation in respect of very strict,97
NA,liability laws.,97
NA,This will mean that Australia will increase,97
NA,the number of cases brought against manufac-,97
NA,turers and will take a further step down the,97
NA,road to a litigious society. In the long term,97
NA,"that will not help consumers, who will pay",97
NA,"higher prices as the cost factor, and the risk",97
NA,of litigation is factored into prices. It will,97
NA,"make Australia, however, a high risk zone for",97
NA,business investment and manufacture. I ask,97
NA,the Attorney-General's Department to recon-,97
NA,sider. (TIme expired),97
Mr MOORE ,Ryan) (10.47 p.m.)-In the,97
NA,time available tonight I want to speak about,97
NA,"the Trade Practices Commission, the Trade",97
NA,Practices Act and the competitive policy,97
NA,perceived by the government of the day. The,97
NA,Trade Practices Commission was set up under,97
NA,the Act to pursue the policy of developing,97
NA,competition within industry. As a conse-,97
NA,"quence of that, it is very interesting to hear",97
NA,the debate that is occurring today since the,97
NA,appointment of Professor Fels as Chairman of,97
NA,the Trade Practices Commission. Before doing,97
NA,"that, it is worth seeing how, in the Govern-",97
NA,"ment's mind, it prices its priorities.",97
NA,When the Trade Practices Commission first,97
NA,"came into office in 1983-84, its funding was",97
NA,$6.6m. In 1991-92 it is $14m. I compare this,97
NA,"with the Parliamentary Library at $lIm, the",97
NA,Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute at,97
NA,"$7m, the Australian Film, Television and",97
NA,"Radio School at $lOm, the Aboriginal and",97
NA,Torres Strait Islander Commission operating,97
NA,"cost of $552m, the Trade Union Training",97
NA,"Authority at $10m, the Australian Institute of",97
NA,Marine Science at $14m and the Shipping,97
NA,Industry Reform. Authority at $24m. We,97
NA,should think of that when we think of,97
NA,industrial reform.,97
NA,The Government has spoken a lot about,97
NA,"competitive policy. It is all about competition,",97
NA,improving micro-economic reform and mak-,97
NA,ing Australia improve. In one of the best,97
NA,"examples of this, we had the Attorney-",97
NA,General in October of this year saying that he,97
NA,would examine competitive policy. In March,97
NA,1991 the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) said that,97
NA,it was a matter of highest priority. In October,97
NA,1991 the Treasurer ( Mr Kerin) said that,97
NA,competitive policy was on the agenda. -,97
NA,"While all this was occurring, there hav",97
NA,been no changes to the Trade Practices Ac,97
NA,and we are heading for a situation where there,97
NA,are severe challenges to the area of competi-,97
NA,tion within Australia. We can take the situa-,97
NA,"tion of the airlines, which have recently been",97
NA,"deregulated, with the introduction of Compass",97
NA,"Airlines. On top of that, there is the prospec-",97
NA,tive entry of the company AAA.,97
NA,If one of those airlines was to be taken,97
NA,"over-at present, I am referring to Compass-",97
NA,"and we went back to the two-airline system,",97
NA,as I understand the Act there is no role for the,97
NA,Trade Practices Commission to participate in,97
NA,"this question, to adjudicate in the area of",97
NA,competition.,97
NA,"More importantly, today we have all the",97
NA,"business about the Fairfax takeover. The,",97
NA,Trade Practices Commission says that it is not,97
NA,in it. Is it not supposed to be the body which,97
NA,determines whether competition is within the,97
NA,country or not? Or is that an area which,97
NA,should not be regarded as too close because,97
NA,it is close to the heart of the ALP? It wants,97
NA,to fix it. There is nothing like a fix with,97
NA,"Murdoch, Packer and the boys. It is at it all",97
NA,"the time. Therefore, to change the competitive",97
NA,"practice of the Trade Practices Commission,",97
NA,"where it should rightly be, the Government",97
NA,"walks away from it, despite what the",97
NA,"Attorney-General ( Mr Duffy), the Prime",97
NA,Minister and the Treasurer said in the last 12 i,97
NA,months about competitive policy. They just do i,97
NA,not mean it. I,97
NA,A committee was set up to look at section,97
NA,45D of the Trade Practices Act. That commit-I,97
NA,tee was supposed to come out with a quick,97
NA,report. We never heard a word from it. It is,97
NA,floating around somewhere. It disappeared.,97
NA,Then there was the question of the Griffiths,97
NA,Committee report. It came out with a variety,97
NA,of recommendations. 'TWo and a half years,97
NA,later there was a response. That response,97
NA,itemised the changes that were deemed to be,97
NA,"necessary, which included cost recovery",97
NA,"measures, increases in penalties, statutory",97
NA,"remedies in respect of breaches, legislative",98
NA,recognition of the merger consultation,98
NA,"process---in other words, the authorisation",98
NA,process-and the ABS data system for use by,98
NA,the Trade Practices Commission.,98
NA,But there has been no action from the,98
NA,"Government, not a word, despite these assur-",98
NA,"ances from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer",98
NA,and the Attorney-General about competitive,98
NA,policy. The reason they do not want to be in,98
NA,this is that they have a number of conflicting,98
NA,interests. One is their big mates and the other,98
NA,is the big unions. The big unions are particu-,98
NA,larly worried about this because one of the,98
NA,recommendations that came around is that we,98
NA,should address ourselves to the question of,98
NA,penalties. The penalties under the current Act,98
NA,"are $250,000 and up to $5m. The recommen-",98
NA,dations are that this ought to be addressed. It,98
NA,"was outmoded. Professor Baxt, the retiring",98
NA,"Chairman, and even the Attorney-General,",98
NA,"said that. In New Zealand the penalty is $5m,",98
NA,it is $lOm in the USA and $70m in Germany.,98
NA,"An amount of $250,000 will hardly shake the",98
NA,boots here unless we do something about it.,98
NA,Nothing has happened for the simple reason,98
NA,that the unions do not want it. Under section,98
NA,45D a finding against them in those new,98
NA,ranks could send them broke. So the,98
NA,Government has passed that one by and,98
NA,forgotten about it altogether.,98
NA,I am surprised that we have not addressed,98
NA,"the changes th3,t are in the wind. Since the",98
NA,change in the chairmanship of the Trade,98
NA,"Practices Commission, the only major case",98
NA,under section 50 was the Australian Meat,98
NA,Holdings case in 1978. That was put to' the,98
NA,question of market dominance. As a conse-,98
NA,"quence, there have been relatively few rulings",98
NA,which have gone past the authorisation,98
NA,process. I am a believer in pragmatic politics,98
NA,and I think the authorisation process has a lot,98
NA,"to commend it. It saves costs, and people can",98
NA,see their way through it as long as the Com-,98
NA,mission is quite clear as to what the Trade,98
NA,Practices Act says and what Government poli-,98
NA,"cy is, as reflected by the Trade Practices Act.",98
NA,We now have proposals put forward-there,98
NA,are certainly talks under way-by the current,98
NA,Trade Practices Commission to change the,98
NA,law. The test will now be a substantial lessen-,98
NA,ing of competition. I have not heard from the,98
NA,Government. All I have heard from is the,98
NA,Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission.,98
NA,I have not heard any response from the,98
NA,"Opposition as to what its view is, so I pres-",98
NA,ume that we are doing nothing.,98
NA,In view of the economy of Australia and,98
NA,"because of its relative smallness, one of our",98
NA,great dangers is the takeover of monopolies,98
NA,"with monopolistic power, both within business",98
NA,and within the labour market. That is unheal-,98
NA,thy for Australia and unhealthy for the devel-,98
NA,opment of this nation. For all sorts of reasons,98
NA,we ought not to allow the concentration of,98
NA,power in both sides of the equation.,98
NA,"Under section 46, which is another very",98
NA,"controversial area of the trade practices law,",98
NA,while there has only really been one major,98
NA,case-the Queensland Wire case-I suspect,98
NA,that the same approach ought to be that if the,98
NA,authorisation route is taken by the Commis-,98
NA,"sioner and by the practitioners, there would be",98
NA,a far better understanding of law and the,98
NA,process itself. There really is very small court,98
NA,law about the Trade Practices Commission.,98
NA,There are not a lot of lawyers who participate,98
NA,in it to any marked degree. As a consequence,98
NA,"of that, I would hope that we consider the",98
NA,position well before any changes are made to,98
NA,the Trade Practices Act.,98
NA,"Finally, I believe that government business",98
NA,enterprises ought to be brought within the,98
NA,realm of the Trade Practices Act. By doing,98
NA,"that, we would get a far better competitive",98
NA,nature to Australia. Particularly in the State,98
NA,"Government areas, we cannot have major",98
NA,corporations in direct competition with private,98
NA,enterprise that act outside the law as it relates,98
NA,to a number of particular government oper-,98
NA,ations. They disadvantage private enterprise,98
NA,and they disadvantage themselves. (Time,98
NA,expired),98
Mr ANDREWS ,Menzies) (10.57 p.m.)---I,98
NA,address that portion of the Attorney-General's,98
NA,Department's Budget concerning the delivery,98
NA,"of family services, in particular, marriage",98
NA,"education and counselling, family mediation",98
NA,and the family skills program. These are the,98
NA,programs through which the Government,98
NA,supports marriage and family life. La';t year,98
NA,"116,959 couples married in Australia. In the",98
NA,"same year 42,635 were divorced-that is,",99
NA,36.45 per cent of the number of marriages. It,99
NA,is estimated that some 55 per cent of these,99
NA,divorces involved one or more children-that,99
NA,"is, 45,000 children were left with single",99
NA,parents in single parent homes last year. Since,99
NA,"1975 over 700,000 Australian children have",99
NA,suffered the emotional trauma of parental,99
NA,divorce.,99
NA,The total expenditure on family services is,99
NA,"$16.6m, of which $11.7m is expended on",99
NA,grants to marriage counselling and just,99
NA,"$500,700 on marriage education grants. Less",99
NA,than $5 per marriage is spent by the,99
NA,"Government on education programs, when the",99
NA,"cost of picking up the pieces is $2.5 billion,",99
NA,"or some $12,000 for each separation.",99
NA,While I could speak at length about the,99
NA,"inequity of this allocation, particularly to",99
NA,"marriage education, my purpose tonight is to",99
NA,address the mismanagement by the Depart-,99
NA,ment of even this pittance. The Minister has,99
NA,no adequate policy for the allocation of,99
NA,grants. At a recent meeting of the Australian,99
NA,"Association for Marriage Education, at which",99
NA,"I was present, an officer of the Department",99
NA,stated:,99
NA,... the Department developed a number of formu-,99
NA,lae and asked the Minister to choose one. He chose,99
NA,to make grants on the basis of last year's expendi-,99
NA,ture minus one-off expenditure.,99
NA,"While this might sound reasonable, the reality",99
NA,is that there is no proper basis for this funding,99
NA,"policy. In a letter to agencies, the Director of",99
NA,the Office of Family Services admitted:,99
NA,"As with many community programs of this nature,",99
NA,agencies and programs have been funded over the,99
NA,years on an ad hoc basis with inadequate financial,99
NA,information on the levels of services being provided,99
NA,"for grants received, little needs based planning and",99
NA,no forward agreement as to what was expected to,99
NA,be delivered for the grant.,99
NA,Mr Winder continued:,99
NA,"At the time of the 1990-91 Budget it was, unfortu-",99
NA,"nately, not possible on the information available",99
NA,provide the Minister with a clear picture of what,99
NA,services were being funded and where and thus,99
NA,where he might allocate additional funds as a,99
NA,matter of priority.,99
NA,This means that the Minister for Justice had,99
NA,not established a policy for funding family,99
NA,services since his appointment in September,99
NA,"1987, and only late last year did he move to",99
NA,do so.,99
NA,The process chosen illustrates further the,99
NA,scandal in the management of the Office of,99
NA,Family Services. In 1990 the office appointed,99
NA,"a consultative committee, comprising repre-",99
NA,"sentatives of the peak organisations; namely,",99
NA,"Marriage Guidance Australia, the Australian",99
NA,Council of Marriage Counselling Organisa-,99
NA,"tions, Centacare Australia, the Australian",99
NA,Association for Marriage Education and the,99
NA,Catholic Society for Marriage Education. This,99
NA,"committee has met on at least six occasions,",99
NA,during which time it reviewed submissions for,99
NA,new funding and made certain recommenda-,99
NA,tions to the office. I believe that most of the,99
NA,committee's recommendations have been,99
NA,rejected.,99
NA,Given that so little funding is allocated to,99
NA,"family services, why did the Department",99
NA,expend thousands of dollars on establishing,99
NA,"this committee, only to ignore its advice? On",99
NA,what basis did the Minister then allocate the,99
NA,new funds? Yet the Minister seems unaware,99
NA,that there are any problems.,99
NA,At the Senate Estimates Committee on 5,99
NA,"September, Senator Macdonald suggested to",99
NA,the Minister that the five peak organisations,99
NA,throughout Australia are very unhappy with,99
NA,"the administration of the qffice, to which",99
NA,Senator Tate replied:,99
NA,I can say adamantly and categorically that that,99
NA,is utterly wrong. I have never seen peak organisa-,99
NA,tions so happy with any form of consultation that,99
NA,has been undertaken within my portfolio in the four,99
NA,and a half years I have been a Minister. The,99
NA,transformation in the relationship between the,99
NA,Department and the peak organisations in family,99
NA,services has been quite astonishing. I believe that,99
NA,tlley are working very well and in fact playa huge,99
NA,role in the advice that I get as to the priorities for,99
NA,funding various projects.,99
NA,Senator Macdonald then asked:,99
NA,"Minister, you have not received a request from",99
NA,them for an investigation to be initiated into the,99
NA,to operation and administration of the family services,99
NA,section of your Department?,99
NA,Senator Tate replied:,99
NA,"No, not that I know of.",99
NA,Even if the Minister had not received a letter,99
NA,"from Dr Warwick Hartin, the National Direc-",99
NA,tor of Marriage Guidance Australia who wrote,99
NA,to Mr Winder on behalf of the five peak,100
NA,"bodies on 4 September 1991, in which he",100
NA,stated that the peak bodies wished to see the,100
NA,development of an overall policy framework,100
NA,for the delivery of family services before any,100
NA,"guidelines were put in place, and even if the",100
NA,Minister had not seen letters to him from,100
NA,agencies questioning the basis of their funding,100
NA,"for this year, he must have been aware of the",100
NA,"letter dated 25 July 1991, in which his senior",100
NA,adviser said:,100
NA,I have been concerned for some time that the,100
NA,funding situation has been misunderstood.,100
NA,"This letter, on 25 July, was sent in response",100
NA,to a telephone conversation in which Dr,100
NA,Hartin had questioned and complained of the,100
NA,allocation and disbursement of funds. Why,100
NA,was the Minister not aware of this some six,100
NA,weeks later when he appeared at the Estimates,100
NA,"Committee, or was he?",100
NA,There is widespread dissatisfaction from,100
NA,agencies about the conduct of this aspect of,100
NA,"the portfolio. Indeed, I believe that Senator",100
NA,Tate has been sent a letter in the last,100
NA,in which four peak bodies expressed their,100
NA,general dissatisfaction about funding and the,100
NA,absence of government family policy.,100
NA,Yet there is still no evidence of any policy,100
NA,underlying the allocation of funds. I know of,100
NA,agencies that have provided little or no,100
NA,"marriage education ,Programs, yet have been",100
NA,"funded year after year. I am informed, for",100
NA,"example, that Marriage Guidance, South",100
NA,"Australia; received $10,000 for marriage",100
NA,"education last year. It advertised three proincompetence,",100
NA,"grams, two of which had to be cancelled",100
NA,the other one only went ahead because of an,100
NA,"overflow from another agency, and its funding",100
NA,"has been increased to $10,500 this year. Yet",100
NA,"Anglican Family Services, New South Wales,",100
NA,"which provided programs for 500 couples,",100
NA,"received only $6,000 which has been reduced",100
NA,"this year to $5,800. And there are other",100
NA,programs which receive no funding.,100
NA,Where is the much vaunted equity in this,100
NA,allocation? I could give other examples. In the,100
NA,Director's progress report on financial,100
NA,"rangements, Mr Winder states that the Minisinequity",100
NA,"ter, in a letter to agencies approving",100
NA,grants:,100
NA,· . . expressed concern at the practice of some,100
NA,"agencies to budget for and incur deficits, to expand",100
NA,"services and to purchase property without, appar-",100
NA,"ently, ensuring that funds would be available.",100
NA,Yet the Minister has allowed the same situa-,100
NA,tion to continue this year. In a letter sent to,100
NA,"agencies just last month, Senator Tate states:",100
NA,· . . because several agencies had over committed,100
NA,expenditure in 1990-91 contrary to firm advice last,100
NA,"year, it was necessary in some circumstances for",100
NA,additional funds to be allocated.,100
NA,The effect has been to reduce the available,100
NA,"funds for one-off expenditure from $500,000",100
NA,"to $106,000. Even the further allocation is",100
NA,"inequitable. Where agencies complained, they",100
NA,"received additional funds. Indeed, an officer",100
NA,of the section stated two weeks ago:,100
NA,All agencies that asked for a review got one.,100
NA,He also stated:,100
NA,· .. the Minister allocated further funds to Agencies,100

NA,It is a scandal when so little is allocated to,100
NA,"marriage education in particular, and family",100

Mr JULL ,Fadden) (11.08 p.m.)-I will,101
NA,confine my comments tonight to the aviation,101
NA,section of the estimates. There has probably,101
NA,been no other area of government operation,101
NA,that has undergone such massive change and,101
NA,is about to undergo such massive change as,101
NA,the area of aviation during this past 12,101
NA,months. We have seen systems change in,101
NA,terms of new air traffic control arrangements,101
NA,proposed for Australia; we have seen a mas-,101
NA,sive change in the nature of airport ownership,101
NA,in Australia; we have seen tremendous pres-,101
NA,sures placed on general aviation; we have,101
NA,seen the Government decision to go ahead,101
NA,with the privatisation of Qantas Airways Ltd,101
NA,and Australian Airlines; and we have seen a,101
NA,decision made not to change aviation policy,101
NA,during the term of this Government. Of all the,101
NA,changes that are about and of all the reforms,101
NA,that have to be made there is one that stands,101
NA,"out more than any other; that is, the proposal",101
NA,to build the third runway at Sydney,101
NA,(Kingsford-Smith) Airport.,101
NA,I would like to make a couple of comments,101
NA,about this tonight. The Opposition believes,101
NA,that the third runway proposal is one of the,101
NA,most critical pieces of micro-economic reform,101
NA,that Australia needs to undertake urgently; in,101
NA,"fact, needs to undertake now. The benefits",101
NA,that Australia will derive from the construc-,101
NA,tion of that third runway are innumerable. It,101
NA,does not mean that Sydney will be able to,101
NA,handle the growth of traffic coming into,101
NA,Australia over these next several years; it does,101
NA,mean that we will be able to get more effi-,101
NA,ciencies from our domestic airline services,101
NA,and from our international airline services. It,101
NA,does mean that our air freight will be able to,101
NA,"become more competitive and, even more",101
NA,"importantly, it does mean a tremendous",101
NA,change in the lifestyle of a great number of,101
NA,Australians who live around that particular,101
NA,airport.,101
NA,Already the dogs are barking. Already we,101
NA,are seeing from some members of the,101
NA,Government a concerted campaign to sink this,101
NA,most important piece of micro-economic,101
NA,reform that Australia must lmdertake at the,101
NA,moment. This concerns the Opposition.,101
NA,I put the Government on notice now that,101
NA,the Opposition is fully prepared to back any,101
NA,final decision to go ahead with the Sydney,101
NA,"(Kingsford-Smith) Airport third runway, and",101
NA,we trust that that final decision will be made,101
NA,as soon as possible. It does concern us when,101
NA,we see statements from the honourable mem-,101
NA,NA,101
NA,"was talking about the decision, and from the",101
NA,"Treasurer ( Mr Kerin), saying that it was",101
NA,important to go ahead with this project. It,101
NA,does concern us that the honourable member,101
NA,for Barton says:,101
NA,If at the end of the day that is the best the Treasur-,101
NA,er can say . . . that we have to do it to send a,101
NA,signal to business ... then frankly we ought to,101
NA,pack the Labor Party in Government and the whole,101
NA,economy up.,101
NA,It is even more concerning when a Minister,101
NA,of the Crown comes out after a statement by,101
NA,the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Sup-,101
NA,port (Senator Collins) and says:,101
NA,... the EIS firmly established a basis for effective-,101
NA,ly managing all environmental issues and . . .,101
NA,identified no barriers to proceeding with the third,101
NA,runway.,101
NA,Yet the Minister for Higher Education and,101
NA,Employment Services ( Mr Dawkins) said that,101
NA,in his view:,101
NA,. . . the EIS fails to provide a basis for the proposal,101
NA,to proceed.,101
NA,We believe that if the Minister continues that,101
NA,particular line he really has no other option,101
NA,"but to resign from the Government, to get out",101
NA,and to join his friends on the back bench.,101
NA,Some of the stories that are being put,101
NA,around now are really quite fatuous. Let us be,101
NA,perfectly clear: this third runway decision is,101
NA,about improving the lifestyle of a great,101
NA,number of people in the City of Sydney.,101
NA,"About 170,000 are now affected by moderate",101
NA,"aircraft noise. That figure will drop to 82,000",101
NA,"once the new runway is built. The 54,700",101
NA,people seriously affected by aircraft noise will,101
NA,"drop to 26,900.",101
NA,The proposed third runway has been around,101
NA,for the last 20 years. A decision for an addi-,101
NA,tional rtmway was made by the coalition in,101
NA,government in 1983 under the stewardship of,101
NA,the honourable member for Rume ( Mr Fife).,102
NA,It should have been built then. This runway,102
NA,is about efficiencies and it is about providing,102
NA,proper services to the people of rural New,102
NA,"South Wales. It is about creating 40,000 jobs",102
NA,"for the people of New South Wales and, not",102
NA,"only that, being able to provide jobs within",102
NA,the tourist industry right around Australia.,102
NA,I also turn my attention very briefly to the,102
NA,decision by the Government during this past,102
NA,12 months not to change its international,102
NA,aviation policy for Australia in the life of this,102
NA,particular Parliament. This decision was made,102
NA,"to ensure, it said, that we would have the best",102
NA,possible price options for Qantas. May I say,102
NA,that I was deeply disturbed by the,102
NA,Government's decision on an application by,102
NA,the only charter airline operator coming into,102
NA,"Australia, Britannia Airways of Luton in the",102
NA,"UK, that it not be allowed to service the",102
NA,Sydney market this year. That particular,102
NA,decision has taken about $14m out of the,102
NA,Sydney economy. While the scheduled ser-,102
NA,vices operating in and out of Australia suf-,102
NA,fered immensely from the Gulf war in recent,102
NA,"times, it was in fact Britannia which kept its",102
NA,"part of the contract and continued, with 90-",102
NA,"plus per cent load factors, to bring tourists to",102
NA,Australia-,102
NA,Recently I was in the United Kingdom and,102
NA,I had discussions with Britannia Airways. I,102
NA,was taken through that airline's projections of,102
NA,the UK charter market to Australia. It believes,102
NA,that potentially within 5 to 10 years the,102
NA,chartei)'market to Australia could be half a,102
NA,million people. This year we will get about,102
NA,"14,000 through the charter programs. It is just",102
NA,not good enough for the officials of the,102
NA,Department of Transport and Communications,102
NA,"and, indeed, for the Minister to say it is all",102
NA,"about the dilution of traffic, because it is not.",102
NA,As has been proved around the world time,102
NA,"and time again, if we get into that charter",102
NA,market we are into a totally new market.,102
NA,It is quite interesting to go through the,102
NA,figures from the Department on the expendi-,102
NA,ture effects of visitors from the UK. There is,102
NA,a very real distinction between the time that,102
NA,is spent here by people using the scheduled,102
NA,airlines and the time spent by and the ex-,102
NA,penditure of people using the charter services.,102
NA,I took out. those figures for the purpose of,102
NA,tonight's exercise to try to bring home to the,102
NA,Government the importance of a very liberal,102
NA,charter policy in and out of Australia. Sched-,102
NA,uled carriers bring visitors to Australia who,102
NA,"stay 40 days, and that is fine. While they are",102
NA,"here they spend $1,761. The charter operators",102
NA,come here on an all-inclusive package holiday,102
NA,"and stay for 22 days spending $1,779. That is",102
NA,"really the distinction-these charter people,",102
NA,who are used to using these services around,102
NA,"Europe and beyond, are in fact the greatest",102
NA,asset that we could get out of that UK market,102
NA,because they spend more money and they,102
NA,spend it within the infrastructure.,102
NA,I give this warning to the Minister for,102
NA,"Shipping and Aviation Support: if, on any",102
NA,"applications for charter programs, the situation",102
NA,"is not loosened in the future, once again",102
NA,Australia will miss out because the new,102
NA,market that is coming on stream for the UK,102
NA,and Europe is South Africa. South Africa has,102
NA,a lot of similar attractions to Australia. In,102
NA,"recent times, for example, we read that Virgin",102
NA,Atlantic Airways of the UK had applied for,102
NA,and in principle had received approval for two,102
NA,services a week into Australia. It will not,102
NA,operate with any less than four services a,102
NA,week. What has it done? It has applied for,102
NA,and got rights to South Africa because the,102
NA,"attractions are similar, it is 16 hours closer in",102
NA,"terms of flying time, and there is only about",102
NA,two hours difference in terms of time zones.,102
NA,If we are to maximise the number of visi-,102
NA,"tors coming into Australia, we have to make",102
NA,sure that our aviation policy is right. Our,102
NA,present aviation policy just restricts charter,102
NA,"operators to some of the smaller airports, and",102
NA,"there is nothing wrong with that, but those",102
NA,that wipe out Sydney completely are a bit of,102
NA,a danger for the future development of tour-,102
NA,ism and the wealth that it can bring to,102
NA,Australia. It seems very strange to me that the,102
NA,Government is prepared to provide charter,102
NA,"rights into Sydney for Aeroflot, for Air",102
NA,"Lanka, for Lot, the Polish airline, for Lan-",102
NA,"Chile, for Air Mauritius and for Air Malta,",102
NA,yet it will not do it as part of an overall,102
NA,package tour for an outfit like Britannia,102
NA,"Airways which, after all, is only including",102
NA,Sydney as part of an overall itinerary which,102
NA,"includes the prepaid destinations of Cairns,",103
NA,"Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. It",103
NA,"is soon to apply for rights to fly into Darwin,",103
NA,"Alice Springs and, indeed, into Hamilton",103
NA,Island off the Queensland coast.,103
NA,So if the Minister does nothing more during,103
NA,"the life of this Parliament, at least he should",103
NA,have the sense to recognise the tremendous,103
NA,contribution that can be made out of proper,103
NA,charter rights into Australia and open up this,103
NA,place to that huge market. It is a completely,103
NA,"new market, a market we will not have access",103
NA,to unless these charters are allowed to operate,103
NA,out of the individual airports of the UK.,103
Mr HOLLIS ,Throsby) (11.17 p.m.)-I,103
NA,planned to make a wide-ranging speech this,103
NA,evening concerning the appropriation to the,103
NA,Department of Transport and Communica-,103
NA,"tions, but in fact the speech is on my desk",103
NA,"because at 9 0' clock this evening I received,",103
NA,"in the internal mail system, one of the most",103
NA,biased and misinformed pieces of lUbbish-I,103
NA,could not distinguish it by calling it journal-,103
NA,ism-I have seen in my nine years as a,103
NA,member of parliament. An accompanying,103
NA,"letter informed me this article, entitled 'Time",103
NA,"to get tough on the waterfront', will appear in",103
NA,"the October issue of that intellectual giant,",103
NA,Reader s Digest. I must say the accompanying,103
NA,letter was as lurid and as misinformed as the,103
NA,offending article.,103
NA,Having spent most of the past year as a,103
NA,member of the House of Representatives,103
NA,"Standing Committee on Transport, Communi-",103
NA,"cations and Infrastructure, I visited most of",103
NA,the ports around Australia as part of the,103
NA,inquiry into land and seaports interface,103
NA,reform. I can say with some authority that this,103
NA,"article is full of lies, distortions and misinforthe",103
NA,mation. It takes a naive and simplistic ap-,103
NA,proach and places all the blame for our,103
NA,inefficient waterfront on the Waterside,103
NA,Workers Federation.,103
NA,Reform of the waterfront is well advanced.,103
NA,"Of course, some members of the Opposition",103
NA,confuse waterfront refornl with reform of the,103
NA,Waterside Workers Federation. The Waterside,103
NA,Workers Federation has been continually,103
NA,attacked by the Opposition and is now at-,103
NA,tacked by the Reader 50 Digest. From reading,103
NA,"the biased article in the Reader s Digest, one",103
NA,could be excused for thinking that nothing has,103
NA,"been achieved on waterfront reform. This, like",103
NA,"most of the article, is a lie.",103
NA,Let us ask what waterfront reform is really,103
NA,about. The waterfront is a reactor. It does not,103
NA,make anything. It makes nothing at all. It,103
NA,does not build anything. It provides a service.,103
NA,People bring things to the waterfront by sea,103
NA,and take them away on land or vice versa.,103
NA,The timetables are very much determined by,103
NA,"those who use the waterfront, whether by sea",103
NA,or by land. It is not done by the waterfront.,103
NA,"As I said before, the waterfront reacts. The",103
NA,Reader s Digest article goes on at length,103
NA,"about the cost to importers and exporters, but",103
NA,what do we find? Exporters tum up at the,103
NA,waterfront after the deadline for a ship has,103
NA,closed wanting to get boxes or bags onto,103
NA,vessels. Why are they not there on time?,103
NA,Usually they have a minimum of seven days,103
NA,notice. Why do the cargoes not come in at an,103
NA,even pace over those seven or 10 days?,103
NA,Explain that to the exporters. Explain to,103
NA,them why 90 per cent of the trucks that go,103
NA,onto the waterfront are empty and come out,103
NA,full or go in full and come out empty. But the,103
NA,Reader 50 Digest article did not mention this.,103
NA,the The situation with these trucks is not the,103
NA,wharfies' fault. Why are our exporters not,103
NA,getting a decent deal on transport service rates,103
NA,to and from the waterfront? Why is this,103
NA,nonsense tolerated? Why is it that when,103
NA,goods come onto the waterfront they sit there,103
NA,waiting to be taken away? The first three days,103
NA,on the waterfront are free when goods come,103
NA,off a ship. Fifteen per cent of the goods go,103
NA,"out on the first day, 20 per cent go out on the",103
NA,"second day, and there is one almighty lUsh on",103
NA,"third day. All that lUsh generates a peak,",103
NA,and it generates confusion and congestion.,103
NA,"Who gets the blame? Again, it is the wharfies.",103
NA,The exporters will always tell us that they,103
NA,are all tucked in behind the big shed; blame,103
NA,"them. But, as exporters, they do not get their",103
NA,goods to the wharf on time and they do not,103
NA,check with their agents to see whether they,103
NA,could get a better deal or a better rate for,103
NA,having the goods there a few days earlier. As,103
NA,"importers, they do not check whether they",103
NA,could get a dedicated time for their ship's,103
NA,arrival so that they could get an even spread,103
NA,"of ships arriving at the terminal, thus reducing",104
NA,the peaks and the congestion. None of these,104
NA,things have been done. The truck queues are,104
NA,not caused by the wharfies but by the shippers,104
NA,who cannot organise to get their cargoes to,104
NA,and from the ships.,104
NA,The farmers who scream loudest are among,104
NA,the worst offenders in this regard. In this,104
NA,"offending article in the Reader s Digest, we",104
NA,are told of a farmer from somewhere in,104
NA,Victoria who spent some time on the,104
NA,"Melbourne wharf, and he went on at great",104
NA,length about the inefficiency. In my area of,104
NA,"Port Kembla, the Waterside Workers",104
NA,Federation and the farmers from the western,104
NA,part of the State around Parkes and Dubbo,104
NA,have worked together to understand each,104
NA,other's problems-and they have done it very,104
NA,successfully.,104
NA,We have to have an efficient system for,104
NA,moving cargoes in and out of ports. For some,104
NA,trucks-and I say this coming from a trucking,104
NA,background-payment for queuing is a con-,104
NA,venient money earner. We have to stop this,104
NA,business of trucks unloading and then leaving,104
NA,empty. There has to be better coordination.,104
NA,There is truly little point in clearing,104
NA,obstacles at the waterside if the ones,104
NA,wharf gate remain in place. The most expenvisited,104
NA,sive aspect of the waterfront today is,104
NA,tugboats. That is.where the real cost is today.,104
NA,But we do not hear this from the Opposition,104
NA,or from the leader writers on our national,104
NA,"newspapers or the Reader s Digest. No, we",104
NA,hear that the waterfront is the site of some,104
NA,"the worst work practice rorts, overmanning",104
NA,and inefficiency. But it is not the wharfies;,104
NA,is the other players on the waterfront. What,104
NA,is always missed out is that there are many,104
NA,players on the waterfront.,104
NA,We hear a lot about the wonderful overseas,104
NA,ports and the ones that we are to be compared,104
NA,"with such as Rotterdam or Singapore and, in",104
NA,"this article, Yokohama-although I never",104
NA,thought that that was such an efficient port.,104
NA,If there is to be a comparison between our,104
NA,"ports-say, Port Kembla-and Rotterdam or",104
NA,"Singapore, then give our ports the equipment",104
NA,and we will deliver the results. These com-,104
NA,"parisons are always very selective, and hon-",104
NA,ourable members opposite are also very,104
NA,selective in the ports that they pick out in,104
NA,Asia. They should go to some of the ports in,104
NA,Thailand and a few of the other ports in,104
NA,"Japan, not the few that they pick out.",104
NA,Singapore is all we hear about. They should,104
NA,go around the ports of South East Asia and,104
NA,make a comparison with the Australian,104
NA,ports-even with the inadequate equipment,104
NA,"that we have in Australian ports. As I said,",104
NA,give us the equipment in our ports-a couple,104
NA,of cranes and so on-and we will achieve the,104
NA,results.,104
NA,Another point about making comparisons in,104
NA,connection with the waterfront is that it is not,104
NA,only the equipment but also the users of the,104
NA,waterfront that must be considered. Would the,104
NA,business people of Singapore or Rotterdam go,104
NA,on with the nonsense that the business people,104
NA,in Australia go on with? Would they have all,104
NA,their cargo come in late? If we are going to,104
NA,"make these comparisons, let us compare the",104
NA,whole work process and not just one aspect,104
NA,of the waterfront.,104
NA,I must say that the hypocrisy of the Opposi-,104
NA,tion on the waterfront is really amazing to,104
NA,the me. Sometimes I wonder whether any of the,104
NA,at the honourable members opposite have ever,104
NA,the waterfront. I must say that I have,104
NA,the never seen any of them wandering around,104
NA,Port Kembla. Their ideologically blinkered,104
NA,view distorts any rational debate with them,104
NA,regarding reform on the waterfront. Despite,104
NA,all the waffle from the Opposition members,104
NA,"of and the rubbish in this article, has anyone",104
NA,ever heard them say anything other than a,104
NA,it criticism of the wharfies? I have not heard of,104
NA,a single plan from the Opposition to increase,104
NA,productivity on the waterfront. Why? Because,104
NA,it does not have any plans.,104
NA,The Opposition's only plan is to bash the,104
NA,"workers and to put in the troops, a move",104
NA,applauded in this article by the Reader s,104
NA,Digest. Honourable members opposite would,104
NA,be much more credible on waterfront reform,104
NA,if they could come up with their own plan for,104
NA,eliminating some of the waterfront practices,104
NA,"of the users of the ports. For example, what",104
NA,"would the Opposition do about queuing,",104
NA,"timely delivery of cargo, electronic transfer of",104
NA,documents and antiquated equipment? The,104
NA,Opposition will not speak on these issues,105
NA,because it has absolutely no policies on them.,105
NA,Let me make it clear: I am not arguing that,105
NA,sorting out the ports is easy. But it is simplis-,105
NA,tic to think that the problem lies only with the,105
NA,wharfies. The Waterside Workers Federation,105
NA,"has been largely restructured, without",105
NA,industrial disputation. If the Opposition,105
NA,"wishes to talk about inefficiencies and rorts,",105
NA,it should look at the other users of the water-,105
NA,front and lift its eyes above the Waterside,105
NA,Workers Federation.,105
NA,It is a great pity that this article in the,105
NA,October issue of the Reader's Digest is so,105
NA,inaccurate and distorted. I note that the next,105
NA,speaker to take part in this debate is the,105
NA,honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp).,105
NA,"As he is extensively quoted in this article,",105
NA,which includes the Leader of the Opposition,105
NA,"(Dr Hewson), I will be very interested to hear",105
NA,what he has to say. It is very interesting that,105
NA,the writers of this article did not contact any,105
NA,member of the Government.,105
NA,"It is just a mouthpiece for the farmers, for",105
NA,the honourable member for Gilmore and for,105
NA,the Leader of the Opposition. I must say it is,105
NA,one of the most disgraceful pieces of journal-,105
NA,ism that I have ever seen and it is also the,105
NA,most inaccurate. I have been asked to do my,105
NA,best to publicise it. I will most certainly,105
NA,publicise it by publicising the lies and the,105
NA,distortion in this rubbish.,105
Mr SHARP ,Gilmore) (11.27 p.m.)-It is,105
NA,with some interest and pleasure that I follow,105
NA,my friend the honourable member for Throsby,105
NA,( Mr Hollis) in consideration of the Appropri-,105
NA,"ation Bill (No.1) in committee. I, like he, will",105
NA,focus my comments on the matters relating to,105
NA,"the waterfront, but following the comments",105
NA,made by the honourable member for Throsby,105
NA,I will have a somewhat different introduction,105
NA,from that I had planned. The honourable,105
NA,member made a concerted attack on the,105
NA,credibility of an article in the Reader's Di-,105
NA,"gest, an article which I have read and found",105
NA,to be one that represented the case more fairly,105
NA,than the honourable member for Throsby,105
NA,would think.,105
NA,There is no doubt whatsoever that the case,105
NA,put by the Reader's Digest article is one,105
NA,which is the view of many people in,105
NA,Australian society today. The honourable,105
NA,member for Throsby and others on his side of,105
NA,"the House will take offence at that view, but",105
NA,it has come about because of the incredible,105
NA,"excesses, rorts and militancy of the people",105
NA,who have worked on the Australian water-,105
NA,front. Those excesses and rorts have cost,105
NA,"Australian society about $1,OOOm a year.",105
NA,The honourable member for Throsby takes,105
NA,great offence at the fact that in the Reader's,105
NA,Digest article wharfies are being blamed for,105
NA,the problems of the Australian waterfront. Let,105
NA,me point out to him that there is good justifi-,105
NA,cation for blaming wharfies; wharfies certain-,105
NA,ly deserve a great deal of blame for what goes,105
NA,on in the Australian waterfront. It is wharfies,105
NA,who have been able to get away with wages,105
NA,"of around $47,000 a year, on average, for '1",105
NA,"27-hour work week, on average. It is wharfies",105
NA,who have been able to use their incredible,105
NA,"union muscle, their industrial relations",105
NA,"muscle, to achieve working conditions which",105
NA,most people in the Australian work force,105
NA,would consider to be some type of workers',105
NA,paradise.,105
NA,The sorts of allowances and the sorts of,105
NA,conditions that wharfies get are unique in the,105
NA,Australian work force. Nobody else in the,105
NA,Australian work force can enjoy the sorts of,105
NA,conditions that wharfies get. Who has heard,105
NA,of people who can be paid for 20 years with-,105
NA,out ever turning up at their place of work?,105
NA,Who has heard of people who can work as a,105
NA,"tag team where the team is divided into two,",105
NA,"half the team turns up and does the work, the",105
NA,other half goes home? Both halves of the,105
NA,team get full pay although only half the team,105
NA,actually did any work. There are countless ex-,105
NA,ercises that one could run of the sorts of rorts,105
NA,that have operated on the Australian water-,105
NA,front.,105
NA,"Of course, the honourable member for",105
NA,Throsby is partly right in his criticism in the,105
NA,sense that it is not entirely the fault of the,105
NA,Waterside Workers Federation of Australia,105
NA,that there are problems on the Australian,105
NA,waterfront. It is also the fault of the managers,105
NA,"of waterfront labour; that is, the stevedores.",105
NA,They are the ones who have given in and,105
NA,taken the easy option in times gone past and,105
NA,who have let the Waterside Workers Federa-,105
NA,tion and its members get away with the sorts,106
NA,of rorts and excesses that it has. Let us share,106
NA,the blame around a bit further and say it is,106
NA,also the stevedores.,106
NA,If we are going to be totally honest about,106
NA,"this, we also have to share the blame a little",106
NA,further and blame governments of the past-,106
NA,governments on both sides of the political,106
NA,"fence. In this day and age, we should blame",106
NA,the Labor Party's side of the political fence,106
NA,for what goes on today. It is governments that,106
NA,have allowed the stevedores and the wharfies,106
NA,to get away with the conditions that apply on,106
NA,the Australian waterfront today. As the Indus-,106
NA,try Commission and as our own Prime Minis-,106
NA,"ter ( Mr Hawke) have pointed out, it costs the",106
NA,"Australian economy at least $1,000m a year",106
NA,for the inefficiencies. So is it any wonder that,106
NA,the Reader s Digest has an attack on the,106
NA,wharfies of Australia? Can we blame people,106
NA,such as those who write articles in Reader s,106
NA,Digest for taking umbrage at the sorts of,106
NA,things that go on on the Australian water-,106
NA,front? I think their views would be typical of,106
NA,the views of most people around Australia,106
NA,today.,106
NA,The honourable member for Throsby tried,106
NA,to blame the lack of international' best prac-,106
NA,tices on our Australian waterfront on inad-,106
NA,"equate equipment: somehow or other, we do",106
NA,not achieve these international standards of,106
NA,efficiency because we do not have the equip-,106
NA,ment to match other countries like Singapore,106
NA,and other parts of the world. The fact is that,106
NA,we do have the type of equipment. I have,106
NA,been extensively throughout the Australian,106
NA,waterfront. I think I have visited virtually,106
NA,every major port and a lot of regional ports in,106
NA,Australia. I can assure honourable members,106
NA,"that the types of portainer cranes, straddle",106
NA,"cranes, fork-lifts and all of that sort of equipdetailed",106
NA,ment that operate here in Australia are exactly,106
NA,the same as equipment that operates in,106
NA,"Singapore, Rotterdam and Philadelphia.",106
NA,If one looks at the Government's waterfront,106
NA,"reform program, one will find that under its",106
NA,"program, National Terminals, the second",106
NA,"biggest stevedore operator in Australia, hopes",106
NA,"to achieve, when it has fully completed its",106
NA,"reform programs, 23 TEUs-that is, 20-foot",106
NA,equivalent unit lift rate -per hour.,106
NA,Mr Downer-What is it in Singapore?,106
Mr SHARP,Honourable members get,106
NA,upset about a comparison with Singapore. Let,106
NA,me take a comparison between a likeminded,106
NA,people and Australians. Let me look at a port,106
NA,like Philadelphia in the United States. They,106
NA,"can manage 33 TEUs per hour; that is, 33 20-",106
NA,foot equivalent containers can be lifted onto,106
NA,a ship in the port of Philadelphia every hour.,106
NA,"In Australia, after the Government's water-",106
NA,"front reform program has been completed, it",106
NA,will be hoping to get 23. Is that any sort of,106
NA,"international best practice? Of course, it is",106
NA,not. That is highlighting the failure of this,106
NA,Government's reform program.,106
NA,One can look at the cost of lifting those,106
NA,containers. It is around $225 a container to,106
NA,lift them from the shore to the ship in an,106
NA,"Australian port. That is a rough estimate, but",106
NA,it is fairly accurate. In Singapore-which we,106
NA,were just talking about a moment ago-the,106
NA,equivalent container costs between $100 and,106
NA,$120 to lift. In .the United Kingdom it is,106
NA,around $140 a container to lift. So one can,106
NA,see that the equipment in those ports-be it,106
NA,"Australia, Singapore, Philadelphia or wherever",106
NA,else one wants to compare with-is exactly,106
NA,the same. The difference is the rate at which,106
NA,we work-the sorts of work practices that we,106
NA,have in Australia now and ·the sorts of work,106
NA,practices that we will still have post this,106
NA,Government's reform program.,106
NA,The honourable member for Throsby went,106
NA,on about the fact that the Opposition does not,106
NA,"have a waterfront reform plan. In fact, that is",106
NA,"totally incorrect. In the last election, the",106
NA,Opposition went to the voters with a water-,106
NA,front reform policy that was nine pages in,106
NA,length. We have several more pages to add to,106
NA,that policy since those days. Our policies are,106
NA,and deal with the very fatal flaw that,106
NA,the Government leaves in its waterfront,106
NA,"reform program; that is, its determination to",106
NA,leave Australian wharfies with a job for life.,106
NA,No workplace in Australia enjoys a job for,106
NA,life except the Australian waterfront. What is,106
NA,so special about wharfies? Why are they,106
NA,different from any other worker in Australia?,106
NA,The reason is the Waterside Workers Federa-,106
NA,tion has unashamedly used its industrial,106
NA,muscle to get that condition for its workers.,106
NA,"That is being kept by Labor's people, by the",107
NA,"Government and, as a result of that, no",107
NA,wharfie can be sacked.,107
NA,"As a result of the Government's program,",107
NA,after two years we have had a 14.5 per cent,107
NA,reduction in the numbers of people on the,107
NA,Australian waterfront. As a result of the,107
NA,"recession that the Government gave us, we",107
NA,have had a 30 per cent downturn in the,107
NA,volume of trade over the Australian water-,107
NA,front. What does that mean? It means that,107
NA,"today, after two years of the Government's",107
NA,"three-year waterfront reform program,",107
NA,Australia's waterfront is now more over-,107
NA,manned than it was before the Government,107
NA,started the reform program.,107
NA,Tell me whether that is the sort of reform,107
NA,program it should be proud of. Tell me,107
NA,whether that is not a reasonable reason for the,107
NA,Reader:SDigest article to make some criti-,107
NA,cism of and outrage at what is going on in the,107
NA,Australian waterfront today. It is for those,107
NA,reasons that the Government will find that the,107
NA,"Reader:SO Digest and many other fair-minded,",107
NA,balanced reports-looking at it not from the,107
NA,"trade unionist point of view, not from the",107
NA,"stevedores' point of view, not from the",107
NA,"Government's point of view, but from the",107
NA,ordinary Australian's point of view: the users,107
NA,"of the waterfront, the people who pay for the",107
NA,waterfront in Australia -are justified in the,107
NA,outrage that they have about the conditions,107
NA,that apply on the Australian waterfront today,107
NA,under this Government's reform program. At,107
NA,"the end of two years of waterfront reform, the",107
NA,Government is worse off on the Australian,107
NA,waterfront than when it began its program.,107
NA,That highlights the inadequacy of this,107
NA,Government. (Time expired),107
Mr WRIGHT ,Capricornia) (11.37 p.m.)-,107
NA,I want to raise a matter that relates to another,107
NA,aspect of the Transport and Telecommunica-,107
NA,tions portfolio. I refer to the plan that will,107
NA,take place over the next six months whereby,107
NA,a second telecommunications network will be,107
NA,phased in. We are aware that part of Telecom,107
NA,is virtually being privatised and we are going,107
NA,to have a private enterprise player involved in,107
NA,the delivery of telecommunications. I person-,107
NA,ally regret that decision. I am on the record,107
NA,saying it elsewhere. But that is a fact of,107
NA,political life.,107
NA,"My concern tonight is not privatisation, but",107
NA,privacy. There have been significant changes,107
NA,in recent years regarding access to telecom-,107
NA,munications information. I am specifically,107
NA,talking about the information monitored and,107
NA,recorded by Telecom.,107
NA,I am aware that the office of the Attomey-,107
NA,General ( Mr Duffy) is looking at some mat-,107
NA,ters that relate to interpretation. It is the,107
NA,interpretation as to what ought to be acces-,107
NA,sible. Under the old Telecommunications,107
NA,"(Interception) Act there were very, very tough",107
NA,restrictions as to what one could access. This,107
NA,is not just talking about the electronic white,107
NA,pages which are really just a duplication of,107
NA,"the telephone book, not just silent numbers,",107
NA,not just numbers to name. One must realise,107
NA,that often people have tried to find out the,107
NA,name of the person by having a telephone,107
NA,number rather than looking up the name and,107
NA,chasing th- number.,107
NA,It really goes back to the intercepted,107
NA,information. This is intercepted information,107
NA,"not by individuals, but by Telecom itself. To",107
NA,"simplify the matter, I am referring to records",107
NA,of calls; the information that Telecom has,107
NA,collected relating to the bills; the call charger,107
NA,records-CCRs as they are called-records of,107
NA,calls to someone by whom from some place,107
NA,and when and where. In the past this sort of,107
NA,information has only been available to the law,107
NA,enforcement agencies; the National Crime,107
NA,"Authority, the Australian Federal Police and",107
NA,the Australian Securities Commission. ASIO,107
NA,obviously has special privileges as well.,107
NA,It is important that we protect this,107
NA,information from unwarranted access. It really,107
NA,means that if one can get access to that sort,107
NA,of detail one knows all about the activities of,107
NA,"individuals-Australians. In fact, we are",107
NA,talking about something like up to six million,107
NA,Australians who can now be traced simply,107
NA,"because of the sorts of phone calls they make,",107
NA,particularly STD calls which are timed; they,107
NA,are monitored.,107
NA,"As I have said, in the past there were great",107
NA,restrictions under the Telecommunications,107
NA,(Interception) Act. I want to place on record,107
NA,credit to Telecom for the self-imposed stand-,107
NA,ards. It has a very enviable record over a long,108
NA,period for being strict as to who can get at,108
NA,those records. But the question now arises:,108
NA,will the same standards be applied by the,108
NA,"private player, unless enforced very specifical-",108
NA,ly by legislation? What seems to have hap-,108
NA,pened is that there is now some question as,108
NA,to whether the old interception rules will,108
NA,apply to the new telecommunications Act. It,108
NA,"seems that State organisations, State police",108
NA,and other semi or partial law enforcement,108
NA,agencies now appreciate the fact that they can,108
NA,get at this detail. So any State instrumentali-,108
NA,ty-I suppose even local authorities or statu-,108
NA,tory authorities-could start using section 88,108
NA,of the Telecommunications Act to trace the,108
NA,"whereabouts of people who owe money,",108
NA,people who may have broken the law and,108
NA,"people who may be up on charges for, say,",108
NA,"fishery problems, problems with Customs or",108
NA,even with the Department of Social Security.,108
NA,The mind boggles as to who now may have,108
NA,access to Telecom records because of what,108
NA,seems to be a loose interpretation of section,108
NA,88. I believe that we need to understand the,108
NA,"seriousness of this problem in privacy terms,",108
NA,"irrespective of attitude to privatisation, and",108
NA,urge an urgent review of the present position.,108
NA,"More importantly, we should bring down laws",108
NA,that will strengthen the controls that Telecom,108
NA,is trying to impose voluntarily and ensure,108
NA,over the next six months when we have a,108
NA,private player that those rules are enforceable.,108
NA,"I can see enormous problems developing, not",108
NA,just with the electronic white pages. No one,108
NA,"would mind that. After all, if one is willing to",108
NA,"have one's name in the phone book, one",108
NA,would not mind some law enforcement agen-,108
NA,cy being able to access this information on,108
NA,line.,108
NA,There are other issues relating to silent,108
NA,numbers. I argue that we ought to require a,108
NA,"written application. But, when it comes to",108
NA,"other matters, one must question whether",108
NA,anyone should have automatic access to call,108
NA,"charge records, in other words the billing",108
NA,system. Should people have access to the,108
NA,information that relates to the types of sys-,108
NA,"tems that one has, whether PABX or fax",108
NA,systems. Should they have access to STD,108
NA,"records, international direct call records,",108
NA,"reverse call records, 0055 call r-cords or",108
NA,Telecard calls-in fact anything that is time,108
NA,"call related. By having those records, some-",108
NA,one could virtually trace the activities of,108
NA,people right across this nation---',108
NA,Mr Downer-This is what the South,108
NA,Australian Government has been doing.,108
Mr WRIGHT,I am not aware of that. All,108
NA,I know is that we in this Parliament have a,108
NA,responsibility to ensure that our constituents,108
NA,are protected against unwarranted and un-,108
NA,necessary access to that information. That is,108
NA,"all I am asking for. I kn,ow that the Attorney-",108
NA,General has people looking at this. I have,108
NA,raised the matter with the Minister for,108
NA,Transport and Communications (Me Beazley).,108
NA,I am sure that the honourable member for,108
NA,Mayo ( Mr Downer) must be concerned. No,108
NA,parliamentarian would want undue access. I,108
NA,do not want anyone to be able to get hold of,108
NA,"call charge records to know the movements,",108
NA,activities or whereabouts of Australian,108
NA,citizens unnecessarily. That is okay if it is,108
NA,crime related. But we have provision for that,108
NA,"already for the NCA, the Australian Federal",108
NA,"Police, ASIO and other agencies, be they",108
NA,commercially criminally oriented or other-,108
NA,wise.,108
NA,But when it comes to a private competi-,108
NA,tor-and that is what we will get here-will,108
NA,it apply the same standards as Telecom has,108
NA,voluntarily imposed? Will we have a system,108
NA,where the company will sell any information?,108
NA,In recent times in the media we have seen,108
NA,concerns about banks being able to trace,108
NA,debtors. We have seen situations where,108
NA,private eye agencies have been able to get,108
NA,information even through Social Security and,108
NA,other government instrumentalities. It boggles,108
NA,the mind as to what would happen if we had,108
NA,such open access here.,108
NA,It seems that the real issue is whether or not,108
NA,the call charge records are still protected by,108
NA,the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. I,108
NA,ask that that be clarified; I ask that this,108
NA,Parliament give this question the due priority,108
NA,and the importance that it deserves and that,108
NA,"we determine, by regulation, by strengthening",108
NA,section 88 of the present Act or by some,108
NA,"other means, exactly who shall have access.",108
NA,"Should it be the Federal, State and local",108
NA,"authorities and statutory authorities? If so,",109
NA,under what conditions? At the moment a,109
NA,policeman could come along and gain access,109
NA,to the records via a search warrant or a,109
NA,subpoena. There ought to be after-access,109
NA,monitoring. It has been recommended that we,109
NA,do that when the NCA is able to have war-,109
NA,"rants and so on, to ensure that warrants have",109
NA,been issued with good reason.,109
NA,"Surely, whilst we do not want to inhibit or",109
NA,restrict law enforcement procedures or needs,109
NA,"unnecessarily, there have to be rules, and I",109
NA,argue strongly for that. We simply cannot rely,109
NA,on a private enterprise player in the telecom-,109
NA,munications area adopting what Telecom has,109
NA,done in the past. We simply cannot allow,109
NA,such vagueness and looseness in the present,109
NA,law. We need certainty; we need to ensure,109
NA,that regulations can be imposed which are,109
NA,known to the players and which can be relied,109
NA,upon and enforced.,109
NA,"Importantly, we need to protect the rights",109
NA,of citizens. Any applicant-even an applicant,109
NA,from the law enforcement area-should be,109
NA,required to explain why he or she wants that,109
NA,information. Again I stress that we are not,109
NA,talking about the electronic white pages; we,109
NA,"are talking about that coded, recorded, timed",109
NA,"call information, be it STD or otherwise.",109
NA,There ought to be controls on who has access.,109
NA,There is a need for monitoring and random,109
NA,checking. We need to ensure that this loop-,109
NA,hole which appears to exist is closed. I call on,109
NA,other members of parliament to support me in,109
NA,this proposition.,109
Mr HAWKER ,Wannon) (11.46 p.m.)-In,109
NA,speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No.1),109
NA,1991-92 and to the appropriations for the land,109
NA,"transport area, in particular, I would like to",109
NA,remind honourable members of the reactions,109
NA,to this year's Budget-a Budget that seems to,109
NA,have sunk without trace almost as quickly as,109
NA,"it arrived, no doubt to the relief of the Treas-",109
NA,urer ( Mr Kerin). But I think it is time we,109
NA,reminded him of some of the things that were,109
NA,"said. For example, the President of the",109
NA,Australian Road Transport Federation put it,109
NA,"very succinctly and' bluntly when he said,",109
NA,'This year's Federal Budget is the worst,109
NA,possible result for the road transport industry'.,109
NA,It could not be any plainer than that. That,109
NA,comment highlights other aspects of this,109
NA,"Budget, but, most importantly, I think it",109
NA,highlights the problems which are facing the,109
NA,"transport area and, in particular, the road",109
NA,transport area.,109
NA,Whilst going through my notes for my,109
NA,"speech in response to last year's Budget, I",109
NA,was amazed to find on looking at that re-,109
NA,sponse that I could just about use it again this,109
NA,"year. It is 12 months on, and what has",109
NA,changed? What has the Government,109
NA,achieved? The answer is: very little. In one,109
NA,year we have seen almost no progress in the,109
NA,"area of land transport. But, worse than that,",109
NA,Australia has been thrown into a recession,109
NA,that is the worst we have seen in 60 years; for,109
NA,"some people, it is probably the worst they",109
NA,have seen in nearly 100 years.,109
NA,But I suppose we have to give the,109
NA,Government some credit. The National Rail,109
NA,Corporation agreement has been signed and,109
NA,that does offer some hope. But it should be,109
NA,put into context. The new start-up date for the,109
NA,National Rail Corporation is February 1992-,109
NA,seven months after it was supposed to start,109
NA,operation. No doubt that new agreement is,109
NA,"based very much on a hopeful, optimistic",109
NA,"approach but, while all of us would like to",109
NA,"see it succeed, we also ought to be realistic",109
NA,and ask many questions-which I will come,109
NA,to in a little while.,109
NA,We are also looking at the major sector of,109
NA,"our land transport, namely, our road transport.",109
NA,It is facing one of its most difficult periods in,109
NA,"many decades. Not only that, this very diffi-",109
NA,cult time is being exacerbated very much by,109
NA,the fact that the Federal Government has,109
NA,allowed uncertainty to creep in and has in fact,109
NA,created confusion as to what the industry,109
NA,really faces.,109
NA,It is 'little wonder when we look at things,109
NA,such as truck sales that we find the level of,109
NA,sales today at their lowest for 30 years. We,109
NA,are seeing a level of truck sales in this nation,109
NA,which is somewhat akin to the 1950s. That in,109
NA,itself is nothing short of disastrous for the,109
NA,dealers. It also carries implications for the,109
NA,future of our major land transport sector. Not,109
NA,only have we seen the sales drop but also we,109
NA,have seen second-hand trucks literally drop in,109
NA,value to one half of their value a year ago.,109
NA,"All ,of the problems-particularly the",110
NA,confusion-have been brought about by the,110
NA,Government still not giving the industry clear,110
NA,"direction, despite the fact that in May last",110
NA,year proposals were first published for a,110
NA,"change in the whole truck registration scheme,",110
NA,for a threatened increase in the charges for,110
NA,"heavy trucks. More than 12 months later,",110
NA,operators still do not know what that will,110
NA,"mean. Clearly, it is unacceptable, and the",110
NA,Government has much to answer for in the,110
NA,ray that it has treated these operators.,110
NA,Moving specifically to the road funding,110
NA,"area, it is worth making it clear that road",110
NA,funding in this Budget has fallen by over 2,110
NA,per cent. Despite what the Minister for Land,110
NA,Transport ( Mr Robert Brown) might say when,110
NA,he goes around and talks about the land,110
NA,"transport budget, we still come back to the",110
NA,fact that road funding has fallen in real terms,110

NA,Land Transport gave before the last election,110
NA,that road funding would not fall in fact,110
NA,already has been broken.,110
NA,"If we look at what happens to major roads,",110
NA,we see that there is a fall of 4.4 per cent in,110
NA,real terms. Funding for arterial roads has,110
NA,"fallen by nearly 18 per cent in real terms, yet",110
NA,no provision was made to allow the States to,110
NA,find alternative sources of revenue for this,110
NA,"fall. If we look at the records, since 1983-84",110
NA,road funding has fallen nearly 20 per cent in,110
NA,real terms under this Government. This has,110
NA,occurred at the same' time as revenue from,110

Mr HAWKER,This table highlights,111
NA,exactly what has happened to the amount of,111
NA,money going to road funding; what has,111
NA,happened to the amount of fuel excise that,111
NA,has been raised in revenue for the,111
NA,Commonwealth; and what has happened to,111
NA,"the fuel excise rate in cents per litre, which",111
NA,has been indexed since 1984. The table shows,111
NA,quite clearly that the amount of money being,111
NA,spent on roads has steadily declined from a,111
NA,position in 1983-84 of 63c in every dollar of,111
NA,"fuel excise to about 23.3c in 1991-92. Clearly,",111
NA,this Government has a very shabby record in,111
NA,"its treatment of the motorist and, in particular,",111
NA,the road transport area.,111
NA,Mr Baldwin-That is a very unkind thing,111
NA,to say.,111
Mr HAWKER,"It may be unkind, but I",111
NA,am putting out the facts for everyone to see.,111
NA,We have also seen indecision about where,111
NA,road transport charging is going. We have not,111
NA,only seen the difficulties facing the truck,111
NA,retail area but also seen that the recession that,111
NA,the Government told us that we had to have,111
NA,has had a very marked effect on the road,111
NA,transport industry.,111
NA,"In fact, in the June· quarter, because of this",111
NA,"Government induced recession, there was a",111
NA,fall of 9.5 per cent in interstate road freight,111
NA,moved. That followed a similar fall in the,111
NA,"March quarter. It is also worth noting that,",111
NA,"while fuel excise continues to be indexed, the",111
NA,indexation of road funding ended on 30 June,111
NA,this year and there has been no commitment,111
NA,in this Budget to increase it.,111
NA,I would like to go into some detail about,111
NA,what the whole Special Premiers Conference,111
NA,agreement on road user charging is supposed,111
NA,"to mean. At this stage, we are deeply con-",111
NA,cerned about the impact that the agreement is,111
NA,likely to have on rural and remote Australia.,111
NA,"to calculate real value, 1984-85 prices.",111
NA,road funding to Local Government ($231.8rn).,111
NA,"oil, heating oil, airline fuel and kerosene.",111
NA,Bicentennial Road Development Program and first year,111
NA,indexed the excise to the CPr.,111
NA,Despite repeated calls by the Opposition over,111
NA,12 months for a proper impact study to be,111
NA,"done, so far virtually nothing has been done.",111
NA,All that has been promised is a fairly small,111
NA,inquiry into the effect of increased charges for,111
NA,heavy vehicles on grain and beef in Queens-,111
NA,"land and the Northern Territory. Interestingly,",111
NA,"it was put that way, although the Northern",111
NA,Territory does not grow wheat.,111
NA,These proposals do not look at the impact,111
NA,on people living in rural towns. We believe,111
NA,that this is something of great concern. It is,111
NA,also of great concern considering the major,111
NA,disparity between the figures quoted by the,111
NA,Prime Minister in his address to Grains 2000,111
NA,and the Northern Territory Government in its,111
NA,detailed analysis on the likely impact of,111
NA,"increased charging on road users, particularly",111
NA,on those living in rural and remote areas.,111
NA,There are many questions to be asked in this,111
NA,whole area and there are many questions,111
NA,which have not been answered by the,111
NA,Government. I believe the Opposition has,111
NA,every right and responsibility to continually,111
NA,raise these questions until the Government,111
NA,does give full and frank answers to what these,111
NA,sort of charges mean. (Time expired),111

NA,at the end of each month. Federation Building,114

NA,policies and interest rates of financial corporations,114
NA,with total assets in Australia of $5 million or more.,114

NA,(4) A number of measures arising out of a review,115
NA,of the Life Insurance Act 1945 were recently,115
NA,passed by the House of Representatives and are,115
NA,now before the Senate. The measures include:,115
NA,an increase in the minimum capital require-,115
NA,"ments to $10 million from the current $2 million,",115
NA,coupled with more stringent operational require-,115
NA,ments regarding the maintenance of capital;,115
NA,measures to enable pre-vetting of changes in,115
NA,"ownership or control of Ii-e insurance companies,",115
NA,and to disqualify a person who has been bank-,115
NA,"rupt, or convicted of an offence relating to",115
NA,"insurance law or dishonest conduct, from acting",115
NA,as a director or principal officer of a company;,115
NA,adjustments to the powers of the Commission-,115
NA,er to facilitate formal investigation processes and,115
NA,a reduction in the period allowed for companies,115
NA,to submit annual financial statements.,115
NA,The major issues which continue to be under,115
NA,review relate to the level of solvency margin that,115
NA,is appropriate to be maintained in statutory funds,115
NA,and associated actuarial and technical matters.,115
NA,"Several submissions, including major submissions",115
NA,from the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the,115
NA,"Life Insurance Federatioh of Australia, have been",115
NA,"received. i Work in connection with the review,",115
NA,including a survey of United Kingdom and,115
NA,"Canadian legislation, is proceeding in the Insurance",116

NA,Vietnamese Immigration,116
NA,(Question No. 667),116
Mr RUDDOCK , the Minister for,116
NA,"Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic",116
NA,"Affairs, upon notice, on 14 March 1991:",116
NA,(1) Has provision been made for immigration to,116
NA,Australia of those Vietnamese who worked for the,116
NA,Australian forces during the Vietnam War.,116
NA,(2) Has information been collected to identify,116
NA,how many are still in Vietnam and who would,116
NA,migrate to Australia if they had the opportunity.,116
NA,(3) Have any applications from persons such as,116
NA,those referred to in part (2) been received by,116
NA,"immigration officials; if so, how many.",116
NA,(4) Are the applicants referred to in part (3) eli-,116
NA,gible under the Special Humanitarian Program as,116
NA,former allies.,116
NA,Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable,116
NA,member's question is as follows:,116
NA,(1) There are no special provisions in place for,116
NA,the migration of former employees of the,116
NA,"Australian Forces. Since 1988, when revised pro-",116
NA,cedures for emigration were agreed with the,116
NA,"Vietnamese authorities, the criteria for migration",116
NA,from Vietnam have been essentially the same as,116
NA,those applying to any other country.,116
NA,(2) In 1984 a list was compiled of Indochinese,116
NA,with claimed links with Australia requesting,116
NA,resettlement. 1Welve of these claimed former,116
NA,employment with the Australian forces (one of,116
NA,whom however had stronger ties with the United,116
NA,States).,116
NA,(3) The Australian Embassy in Bangkok (respon-,116
NA,sible for most of the processing of Vietnamese,116
NA,migration applications) advises that they are aware,116
NA,of one letter requesting migration advice from a,116
NA,person claiming to be a former employee of the,116
NA,"Australian armed forces, but have not received any",116
NA,actual migration applications. The Australian,116
NA,Embassy in Hanoi has had three enquiries but no,116
NA,applications. Such people may have migrated under,116
NA,the Vietnam Migration Procedures in the past but,116
NA,cases cannot be separately identified on this basis.,116
NA,(4) Applications for entry under the in-country,116
NA,Special Humanitarian Program are normally only,116
NA,90nsidered from designated countries: Vietnam is,116
NA,not one of these. Applications from persons in non-,116
NA,designated countries are considered only where,116
NA,"exceptional and compelling circumstances exist,",116
NA,and are considered on their merits. Links with,116
NA,Australia are a consideration in claims to resettle-,116
NA,ment under this program.,116

NA,"Housing and Community Services, upon",116
NA,"notice, on 7 May 1991:",116
NA,(1) What is the total cost of the National Hous-,116
NA,"ing Strategy and related projects, including current",116
NA,and prospective research into the perceived problem,116
NA,of locational disadvantage.,116
NA,(2) What sum will be spent on research into,116
NA,locational disadvantage.,116
Mr HOWE ,The answer to the honourable,116
NA,member's question is as follows:,116
NA,(1) The estimated cost of the National Housing,116
NA,"Strategy for 1990-91 was $1,467,820, and for 1991-",116
NA,"92 is $1,390,000. This does not include the cost of",116
NA,"staff from my Department who have assisted, and",116
NA,"continue to assist, with research and development",116
NA,of particular issues as required.,116
NA,(2) A survey of Housing and Location Choice,116
NA,and subsequent data analysis which addresses the,116
NA,question of locational disadvantage is being con-,116
NA,"ducted and will cost $345,100 in 1990-91 and a",116
NA,"further $60,000 in 1991-92. Two other studies on",116
NA,Implications of Urban Development Strategies and,116
NA,Housing and the Labour Market are to be con-,116
NA,ducted in 1991-92 at a total estimated cost of,116
NA,"$50,000.",116

NA,(Question No. 822),117
NA,Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for,117
NA,"Health, Housing and Community Services,",117
NA,"upon notice, on 15 May 1991:",117
NA,(1) Will the national health strategy review have,117
NA,far-reaching implications for (a) the medical,117
NA,profession and (b) the private health industry;,117
NA,(2) Is either the medical profession or the private,117
NA,health insurance industry represented on the,117
NA,"advisory body to the review; if not, why not.",117
Mr HOWE ,The answer to the honourable,117
NA,member's question is as follows:,117
NA,(1) (a) and (b) The answer to this question will,117
NA,not be known until the Director of the Strategy has,117
NA,reported progressively to the Government on each,117
NA,of the terms of reference and the Government has,117
NA,both considered those reports and decided what,117
NA,"changes, if any, are appropriate.",117
NA,(2) No. While the membership of the Advisory,117
NA,Committee to the National Health Strategy includes,117
NA,"eminent members of the medical profession, they",117
NA,are not formal representatives of the profession.,117
NA,The Advisory Committee was established to,117
NA,bring together individuals with a diverse range of,117
NA,"ideas and experience. In particular, Ms Macklin",117
NA,was seeking ideas and opinions unfettered by the,117
NA,constraints which inevitably apply to office holders,117
NA,representing individual organisations. The Advisory,117
NA,Committee was not established as a fonnal consul-,117
NA,tation process.,117
NA,"I am advised that consultation has been, and will",117
NA,"be, undertaken as a continuous process throughout",117
NA,the development of the Strategy. The consultants,117
NA,with responsibility for individual issues are expect-,117
NA,ed to consult with relevant groups as a routine,117
NA,activity; as issues and background papers are,117
NA,progressively released there will be further oppor-,117
NA,tunity for interest groups and individuals to provide,117
NA,comments and views; and in some cases there may,117
NA,be a need for further consultation prior to Ms,117
NA,Macklin providing advice to the Government.,117
NA,"Accordingly, all interest groups have an oppor-",117

NA,(Question No. 932),131
NA,"Mr Sharp asked the Treasurer, upOn notice,",131
NA,on 20 June 1991:,131
NA,"Do some Japanese-owned businesses in Cairns,",131
NA,"Qld, accept only Japanese currency and refuse to",131
NA,"accept Australian currency; if so, (a) is the practice",131
NA,prohibited and (b) what action will he take to end,131
NA,it.,131
NA,Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable,131
NA,member's question is as follows:,131
NA,I understand that there have been media reports,131
NA,that some businesses in Cairns are apparently only,131
NA,accepting payment in Japanese yen and refusing to,131
NA,"accept Australian currency. I am unaware, however,",131
NA,if these businesses are Japanese-owned.,131
NA,As to the specific questions you raised regarding,131
NA,this matter:,131
NA,(a) There is nothing in the Currency Act 1965,131
NA,that would preclude a business or individual acting,131
NA,in the manner described. While Section 16(1) of the,131
NA,Currency Act 1965 and Section 36(1) of the,131
NA,Reserve Bank Act 1959 give legal tender status to,131
NA,"Australian coins and notes, this does not mean that",131
NA,they necessarily have to be accepted. Legal tender,131
NA,status is relevant only in relation to the payment of,131
NA,an existing debt where a method of payment is not,131
NA,specified in the terms of an arrangement giving rise,131
NA,to that debt. It would have no application where a,131
NA,person merely offered an amount of money in,131
NA,exchange for goods to be provided or services to be,131
NA,"supplied. Consistent with this, there is no legal",131
NA,provision that would prevent a business from,131
NA,stipulating that payment must be made in Japanese,131
NA,yen.,131
NA,(b) There has been no restrictions on the use of,131
NA,"foreign currency in Australia, nor on the use of the",131
NA,"Australian dollar outside Australia, since exchange",131

NA,Mr Downer asked the Minister representing,131

NA,(1) Is there a delay in filling the position of,131
NA,"Managing Director, Austrade; if so, why.",131
NA,(2) Is he able to say whether (a) the position,131
NA,referred to in part (1) will be readvertised and (b),131
NA,Mr W Ferris will be an applicant.,131
NA,(3) Will the number of staff in Austrade be,131
NA,"reduced; if so, (a) by what number and (b) will that",131
NA,"number include (i) inoperative staff, (ii) staff lost",131
NA,through natural attrition and (iii) overseas locally,131

NA,(4) Are some of the senior management staff,131
NA,criticised in the MCKinsey review involved in,131
NA,placing staff into a new structure for Austrade.,131
NA,(5) What sum has been spent on implementing,131
NA,recommendations of the MCKinsey review and on,131
NA,the associated task force.,131
NA,(6) Was $10 000 allocated to the task force,131
NA,"referred to in part (5); if so, was this sum inad-",131
NA,equate and where will additional funds be obtained.,131
NA,(7) What is the state of consultation and develop-,131
NA,ment of associated procedures with unions affected,131
NA,by the restructuring of Austrade.,131
NA,(8) Is implementation of the recommendations of,131
NA,the MCKinsey review being hastened solely because,131
NA,elections to convert from the Commonwealth,131
NA,Superannuation Scheme to the Public Sector,131
NA,Superannuation Scheme must be made by 30 June,131
NA,"1991; if so, (a) what efforts did Austrade make to",132

NA,"was tenure offered to certain Austrade staff; if so,",132

NA,following answer. to the honourable member's,132
NA,question:,132
NA,(1) The appointment of Mr Ralph Evans as,132
NA,Managing Director of Austrade was announced' on,132
NA,9 July 1991.,132
NA,(2) See answer to (1).,132
NA,(3) Yes.,132
NA,(a) It is estimated that by the time staff separathe,132
NA,"tions are completed in mid-1992, the net reduction",132
NA,will be 155.,132
NA,(b) (i) No. (ii) Yes. (iii) No.,132
NA,(4) No members of senior management were,132
NA,mentioned in the MCKinsey review.,132
NA,(5) and (6) The sum spent on implementing the,132
NA,MCKinsey review recommendations was $1.046,132
NA,"million, arising from salaries of Austrade staff",132
NA,"working on implementation tasks, travel costs and",132
NA,recruitment of the Managing Director and general,132
NA,managers.,132
NA,Costs of relocation and redundancy payments are,132
NA,not yet finalised. There was no specific allocation,132
NA,"of $10,000 to a task force.",132
NA,(7) Appropriate consultation as set out in the,132
NA,"relevant Award has occurred, and is continuing to",132
NA,"occur, with staff associations on general retrench-",132
NA,"ment principles, structure, staffmg, facilities and",132
NA,review.,132
NA,(8) Implementation of the MCKinsey review,132
NA,recommendations was not hastened solely because,132
NA,of the superannuation question.,132
NA,(a) In response to a formal approach to the,132
NA,"Retirement Benefits Office, Austrade was advised",132
NA,that it was not possible for an extension to be given,132
NA,to the election date.,132
NA,(b) Structural recommendations flowing from the,132
NA,:MCKinsey review were presented for endorsement,132
NA,to the Chairman and the Acting Managing Director,132
NA,at the end of May 1991. The proposals were then,132
NA,provided to the Staff Associations in accordance,132
NA,with the consultative process.,132
NA,Restaffing of the new structure commenced in,132
NA,the week prior to 30 June and is continuing.,132

NA,Acting Managing Director.,132
NA,Other staff whose functions remained substantial-,132
NA,ly unchanged in the new structure were notified of,132
NA,their transfer to the new structure prior to 30 June.,132
NA,(9) No. Appointment to the position of Deputy,132
NA,Managing Director is at the discretion of the,132
NA,Minister. The MCKinsey Review indicated that the,132
NA,position of Deputy Managing Director would be,132

NA,future of the position.,132

Mr DUFFY ,In answer to the honourable,135
NA,"member's question, I am advised as follows:",135
NA,"(1), (2) and (3) In the years following the events",135
NA,which are the subject of the honourable Member's,135
NA,"question, procedures have been reviewed extensive-",135
NA,"ly, particularly in the light of the recommendations",135
NA,of the Report of the Protective Security Review,135
NA,which Mr Justice Hope sent to the Prime Minister,135
NA,on 15 May 1979. The report is on the public,135
NA,record. While the Commonwealth had a direct,135
NA,responsibility for and interest in the safety of the,135
NA,"visiting delegates at the 1978 CHOGRM, the bomb",135
NA,explosion outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney in,135
NA,fact involved offences against the laws of New,135
NA,"South Wales. Therefore, it is for that State and not",135
NA,the Commonwealth to decide whether another,135
NA,inquiry might be warranted. If the New South,135
NA,Wales Government were to decide that there should,135
NA,"be a further inquiry, the Commonwealth would, of",135
NA,"course, co-operate fully.",135
NA,(4) No) for the reasons outlined immediately,135
NA,above.,135
NA,(5) (a) ASIO,136
NA,ASIO provided infonnation to the Protective,136
NA,"Services Co-ordination Centre (PSCC), including",136
NA,"threat assessments, daily situation reports, personal",136
NA,security checks as requested by PSCC and audio,136
NA,counter-measure tests conducted at the Hilton prior,136
NA,to the CHOGRM for the purposes of infonnation,136
NA,security. In 1978 PSCC was a division of the,136
NA,Department of Administrative Services.,136
NA,"(b) ASIO:S auxiliary services, including the VIP",136
NA,Protection Unit,136
NA,No such services or units have been identified.,136
NA,The honourable Member may be referring to the,136
NA,VIP Protection Unit within the PSCC which in,136
NA,1978 was a division of the Department of Adminis-,136
NA,trative Services. At that time the role of the PSCC,136
NA,included the assessment of intelligence from ASIO,136
NA,and the Commonwealth Police and the general co-,136
NA,ordination of security planning for CHOGRM.,136
NA,(c) The AFP,136
NA,"The AFP did not exist in 1978. Its predecessor,",136
NA,"the Commonwealth Police, were essentially respon-",136
NA,sible for the close personal protection of the,136
NA,visiting Heads of Government as they moved,136
NA,around Sydney and security within specified areas,136

NA,The ADF had no specific role in the CHOGRM,136
NA,security arrangements before the explosion.,136
NA,"After the explosion on 13 February 1978, the",136

NA,Head-of-Operation was Chief Superintendent G L,136
NA,Bruce. The officer in charge of PSCC's responsi-,136
NA,bilities in respect of CHOGRM was Mr D Evans.,136
NA,(9) (a) Mr Marshall held the position of Co-,136
NA,ordinator (Infonnation and Intelligence) in PSCC.,136
NA,Mr Marshall was responsible for assessing,136
NA,information relating to the overseas and interstate,136

NA,actions of Senior Superintendent Douglass.,136
NA,"(12) On the information available, it is clear that",136

NA,Commonwealth agency with responsibilities outside,136

NA,"jointly with the NSW Police, provided personal",136
NA,protection services to the delegates. I understand,136
NA,that in 1978 the only sniffer dogs available in the,136
NA,Sydney region belonged to the army and they were,136
NA,trained for different and specifically military,136
NA,purposes.,136
NA,"(14) As noted in the reply to question (5) above,",136

NA,Mr Baldwin-The following answer to the,137
NA,honourable member's question is based on,137
NA,material supplied by the Australian Maritime,137
NA,College:,137
NA,"(1) In 1986, there were 41 students enrolled in",137
NA,the Master Class 1/2 and 2nd Mate courses at the,137
NA,"Austrl,\lian Maritime College. Of these, 9 were",137
NA,"overseas students, comprising 22 per cent of those",137
NA,enrolments.,137
NA,There were 156 students enrolled in the Master,137
NA,Class 1/2 and 2nd Mate courses in 1990. Of these,137
NA,124 students (79 per cent) were from overseas.,137
NA,The increase in the number of overseas students,137
NA,enrolled at the Australian Maritime College reflects,137
NA,in part the Commonwealth's policy of encouraging,137
NA,overseas students to Australia on a full fee paying,137
NA,basis.,137
NA,. (2) Yes. In December 1986 a promotional,138
NA,campaign was undertaken in Singapore. In 1987,138
NA,similar promotional campaigns were undertaken in,138
NA,"Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia. In 1989 its",138
NA,promotional activities were conducted in Malaysia,138
NA,while in 1990 they were in India and Pakistan. In,138

NA,Fluoresceut Light Globes,139
NA,(Question No. 955),139
NA,Mr MCGauran asked the Minister for,139
NA,"Science and Technology, upon notice, on 20",139
NA,August 1991:,139
NA,(1) What toxic compounds exist in standard and,139
NA,other commercially available fluorescent light,139
NA,globes.,139
NA,(2) What practices are followed in the disposal,139
NA,of fluorescent globes.,139
NA,(3) What is the environmental impact of these,139
NA,practices.,139
NA,(4) Is he able to say what quantities of the toxic,139
NA,compounds referred to in part (1) are released,139
NA,annually into the environment through the disposal,139
NA,of fluorescent globes.,139
NA,(5) Are there recycling technologies whlch would,139
NA,allow an alternative to placing used fluorescent,139
NA,"globes in landfill; if so, what is their commercial",139
NA,viability.,139
NA,(6) How do the toxic components of fluorescent,139
NA,globes compare with those of the new generation,139
NA,of incandescent globes.,139
NA,(7) Is the toxic composition of incandescent,139
NA,globes greater than that of the earlier generation of,139
NA,fluorescent globes.,139
NA,Mr Free-The answer to the honourable,139
NA,member's question is as follows:,139
NA,(1) The toxic compounds present in fluorescent,139
NA,light globes are mercury and lead. Cadmium was,139
NA,also present in some globes manufactured in,139
NA,Australia before 1983 and may be present in some,139
NA,imports.,139
NA,(2) Disposal of fluorescent globes is left to,139
NA,individual customers or contractors and spent,139
NA,globes usually go to municipal landfill.,139
NA,(3) The environmental impact of these practises,139
NA,"is not fully known. However, there is no evidence",139
NA,that current disposal methods are producing unac-,139
NA,ceptable levels of contamination. Studies carried,139
NA,out in 1983 by the State Pollution Control,139
NA,Commission could detect no mercury (at an analyti-,139
NA,cal sensitivity of 0.1 microgram/litre) in samples of,139
NA,leachate from a representative sample of municipal,139
NA,landfills.,139
NA,(4) Fluorescent globes manufactured in Australia,139
NA,have a mercury content of less than 15 milligrams,139
NA,"per globe. In addition to mercury, globes manufac-",139
NA,tured in Australia that have soldered pins also,139
NA,contain lead levels less than 200 milligrams per,139
NA,globe.,139
NA,Given that 15 million fluorescent globes are,139
NA,manufactured in Australia and 3 million of these,139
NA,"have soldered pins, then annually 225 kilograms of",139
NA,mercury and 400 kilograms of lead is available for,139
NA,release to the environment from Australian manu-,139
NA,factured globes.,139
NA,I do not have figures for the precise composition,139
NA,"of imported fluorescent globes. However, if one",139
NA,assumes that the 3 million imported fluorescent,139
NA,globes have a similar composition to Australian,139
NA,"globes, then the total potential release into the",139
NA,environment is approximately 270 kilograms of,139
NA,mercury and 480 kilograms of lead annually.,139
NA,(5) I am not aware of any viable recycling,139
NA,"technologies for fluorescent globes. However, there",139
NA,has recently become available a disposal,139
NA,technology known as lamp crushing which claims,139
NA,to recover the residue from spent globes for,139
NA,treatment and disposal. This technology is being,139
NA,assessed by globe manufacturers.,139
NA,(6) Incandescent globes have no toxic compo-,139
NA,nents other than the lead contained within their,139
NA,soldered contacts. The new generation of compact,139
NA,fluorescent globes have a similar toxic content to,139
NA,normal fluorescent globes.,139
NA,(7) Incandescent globes have a lower toxic,139
NA,"composition than fluorescent globes, including",139
NA,earlier generations. The mercury content of current,139
NA,"fluorescent globes, including compact fluorescent",139
NA,"globes, is less than that for earlier generations of",139
NA,fluorescent globes.,139
NA,Metham Sodium,139
NA,(Question No. 958),139
NA,Mr Filing asked the Minister for Small,139
NA,"Business and Customs, upon notice, on 20",139
NA,August 1991:,139
NA,"(1) Will metham sodium, used to control weeds",139
NA,"in vegetable crops, be subject to a 15 per cent",139
NA,import tariff following its reclassification in,139
NA,"September 1990; if so, (a) why and (b) will the",139
NA,imposition jeopardise the international market share,139
NA,of Australian market gardeners because of their,139
NA,resulting higher costs.,139
NA,(2) Why was there a shortage in the supply of,139
NA,"metham spdium in Western Australia in early 1991,",139
NA,a critical petiod for potato farming.,139
NA,Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable,140
NA,member's question is as follows:,140
NA,There has been no reclassification of metham so-,140
NA,dium.,140
NA,Metham sodium imported in a form put up for,140
NA,"retail sale, in packing for retail sale and as a",140
NA,preparation is classified in heading 3808 of Sched-,140
NA,ule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act and is dutiable at,140
NA,a rate of 10 per cent from Developing Countries,140
NA,and 15 per cent from other sources. These rates,140
NA,will phase down to Free from Developing Countries,140
NA,and 5 per cent from other sources from 1 July,140
NA,1996.,140
NA,Metham sodium imported as an organo-sulphur,140
NA,compound and not put in a form previously de-,140
NA,scribed is classified in heading 2930 of Schedule,140
NA,3 to the Customs Tariff Act and is free from duty.,140
NA,I am informed that the unusual shortage in,140
NA,Western Australia early this year resulted from,140
NA,conversion of apple orchards to other uses and the,140
NA,need to treat the soil with weed controllers which,140
NA,created a high demand for the chemical.,140
NA,War Widow Pensions,140
NA,(Question No. 961),140
NA,Mr Harry Woods asked the Minister for,140
NA,"Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August",140
NA,1991:,140
NA,(1) Why cannot eligibility for war widow pen-,140
NA,sions be extended to spouses of deceased female,140
NA,veterans.,140
NA,(2) Do existing legislative provisions presume,140
NA,that the husband is the breadwinner and that there,140
NA,"is no dependence upon female veterans; if so, is",140
NA,this presumption anomalous.,140
NA,(3) Why was the Veterans' Entitlements Act,140
NA,1986 specifically exempted from the operation of,140
NA,the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.,140
NA,Mr Humphreys-The answer to the hon-,140
NA,ourable member's question is as follows:,140
NA,(1) Recent amendments to the Veterans' Entitle-,140
NA,ments Act extended eligibility for war widow's,140
NA,pension to spouses of all female members and,140
NA,"veterans, irrespective of when death occurred,",140
NA,"provided that, at the time of death the female",140
NA,member or veteran was in receipt of the Special,140
NA,(Totally and Permanently Incapacitated) rate of dis-,140
NA,"ability pension or its equivalent, the Extreme",140
NA,"Disablement Adjustment, or where death is or was",140
NA,accepted as being related to war or defence,140
NA,The earliest date of effect for payment in respect,140
NA,"of war widower's pension is 22 January 1991,",140
NA,which was the date the Government announced its,140
NA,decision to eliminate areas of discrimination against,140
NA,females from the legislation.,140
NA,(2) Prior to the recent amendments to the,140
NA,"Veterans' Entitlements Act, the legislative provi-",140
NA,sions relating to war widows' pensions derived,140
NA,from principles which were generally accepted at,140
NA,the time of World War I and subsequent wars and,140
NA,war-like operations. These principles were based on,140
NA,the concept that the husband was the breadwinner,140
NA,"and, therefore, there was no presumption of de-",140
NA,pendence on the female veteran.,140
NA,With the change in community attitudes towards,140
NA,women and the assignment of female ADF mem-,140
NA,bers to the Persian Gulf the Government decided,140
NA,to remove this significant area of discrimination but,140
NA,retained existing provisions relating to treatment,140
NA,and pensions which operate in favour of women.,140
NA,(3) When the Sex Discrimination Bill was,140
NA,"introduced m 1983, the then Repatriation Act",140
NA,contained many differences in benefits for males,140
NA,and females. At the time that the Sex Discrimina-,140
NA,"tion Act 1984 was first enacted, the Repatriation",140
NA,Act 1920 was specifically exempted by paragraph,140
NA,40(2)(c) of that Act. By section 10 of the Acts,140
NA,"Interpretation Act 1901, that reference in the Sex",140
NA,Discrimination Act to the Repatriation Act was,140
NA,then construed as a reference to the Veterans',140
NA,Entitlements Act 1986 which repealed the previous,140
NA,Repatriation Act.,140
NA,The position now is that the Statute Law,140
NA,(Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988 has deleted,140
NA,paragraph 40(2)(c) from the Sex Discrimination,140
NA,"Act, as this exemption is no longer necessary. The",140
NA,reference to the Repatriatibn Act was to legislation,140
NA,"in force prior to 1 August 1984, the date the Sex",140
NA,Discrimination Act came into effect. As the,140
NA,"Veterans' Entitlements Act is a later enacted Act,",140
NA,"it overrides the Sex Discrimination Act, and to the",140
NA,extent that there is any inconsistency between the,140
NA,"provisions of the two Acts, the provisions of the",140
NA,later Act will prevail.,140

NA,"service. Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 1991:",140
NA,(1) Was the report of the MCGirr inquiry into,141
NA,merchant navy war veterans completed on 13,141
NA,October 1989.,141
NA,(2) Has the report been presented to Parliament;,141
NA,"if not, why not.",141
NA,(3) Has the war service of merchant navy war,141
NA,"veterans been reCognised; if not, why not.",141
NA,(4) What action will the Government take in,141
NA,response to the recommendations of the report of,141
NA,the MCGirr inquiry.,141
NA,Mr Humphreys-The answer to the hon-,141
NA,ourable member's question is as follows:,141
NA,(1) The Report on the MCGirr Inquiry into mer-,141
NA,chant navy war veterans was completed on 13,141
NA,October 1989.,141
NA,(2) The Report was not tabled in the Parliament,141
NA,as the Terms of Reference for the Inquiry -ere for,141
NA,it to report to the Minister.,141
NA,(3) The contribution of the merchant navy to the,141
NA,war effort has been recognised in Veterans' Affairs,141
NA,legislation. The Seamen's War Pensions and,141
NA,Allowances Act 1940 provides for pension and,141
NA,other benefits in respect of war caused disablement.,141
NA,In addition service pensions may be provided under,141
NA,the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.,141
NA,(4) The Government has responded to the MCGirr,141
NA,Report by announcing in the 1990-91 Budget that,141
NA,"payment of a non-taxable lump sum of $10,000 to",141
NA,surviving ex-prisoners of war who were illegally,141
NA,interned in Nazi concentration camps during World,141
NA,"War II, would be extended to Australian merchant",141
NA,mariners with effect from 21 August 1990. In meet,141
NA,"addition, in the 1991-92 Budget the Government",141
NA,announced that Repatriation treatment,141
NA,would be granted to Australian mariners on the,141
NA,same basis as Australian war veterans with effect,141
NA,from 1 December 1991.,141
NA,Pharmacy Allowance Payments,141
NA,(Question No. 966),141
NA,Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for,141
NA,"Aged, Family and Health Services, upon allowance.",141
NA,"notice, on 20 August 1991:",141
NA,(1) Under what criteria will essential pharmacy,141
NA,allowances be paid to pharmacists.,141
NA,(2) How many essential pharmacy allowance,141
NA,payments have been made.,141
NA,(3) How many pharmacists will receive payments,141
NA,under the essential pharmacy allowance and what,141
NA,will the average yearly payment be.,141
NA,(4) From what date are pharmacists eligible to,141
NA,claim the allowance.,141
NA,(5) What total sum is expected' to be paid under,141
NA,the allowance.,141
NA,(6) Was there a delay in finalising the manner in,141
NA,which payments under the allowance would be,141
NA,"made; if so, why.",141
NA,(7) Will intetest be paid to pharmacists who have,141
NA,had to wait several months for payments.,141
NA,Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable,141
NA,member's question is as follows:,141
NA,(1) The criteria for a pharmacist to qualify for an,141
NA,Essential Pharmacy Allowance are:,141
NA,being open a minimum of 20 hours;,141
NA,being more than 10 kilometres from the,141
NA,nearest pharmacy;,141
NA,having a claimable Pharmaceutical Benefits,141
NA,Scheme/Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits,141
NA,"Scheme prescription volume of less than 15,000",141
NA,prescriptions in 1989-90.,141
NA,(2) The number of pharmacists who have been,141
NA,approved for payment of the Essential Pharmacy,141
NA,Allowance to the August meeting of the Pharmacy,141
NA,Restructuring Authority was 177. All pharmacists,141
NA,have been paid up to and including June. The July,141
NA,payments are currently being processed.,141
NA,(3) The number of pharmacists who will receive,141
NA,payments under the Essential Pharmacy Allowance,141
NA,is unknown as any pharmacist is free to apply at,141
NA,any time for the allowance if they believe they,141
NA,the eligibility criteria. Average payments will,141
NA,not be available until the end of the first year of,141
NA,benefits operation of the allowance.,141
NA,(4) The allowance commences on the first day of,141
NA,the month following the date that Essential Phar-,141
NA,macy Allowance is approved by the Pharmacy,141
NA,Restructuring Authority.,141
NA,(5) The Government has provided funds of $3,141
NA,"million, in 1991-92 to meet payments for this",141
NA,(6) There was a delay by the Health Insurance,141
NA,Commission in implementing the computer pro-,141
NA,grams to calculate and pay the Essential Pharmacy,141
NA,Allowance. The recording elements of the programs,141
NA,were available in early June while the payment,141
NA,programs were available in late July. Any delays in,141
NA,implementing the payment routines were a result of,141
NA,having tol ensure the accuracy of payments to be,141
NA,made.,141
NA,(7) No. It is not Government policy to pay,142
NA,interest on outstanding payments.,142

NA,What were the dates and texts of the World Heri-,142
NA,tage Committee's decisions on Kakadu National,142
NA,Park.,142
Mrs KELLY ,The answer to the honourable,142
NA,member's question is as follows:,142
NA,(1) At its 5th Session (26-30 October 1981) the,142
NA,World Heritage Committee decided to inscribe,142
NA,Stage I of Kakadu National Park on the World,142
NA,Heritage List. The Committee:,142
NA,'noted that the Australian Government intend-,142
NA,ed to proclaim additional areas in the Alligator,142
NA,Rivers Region as part of Kakadu National Park,142
NA,and recommended that such areas be included in,142
NA,the site inscribed on the World Heritage List and,142
NA,that in the Region the environmental protection,142
NA,measures specified in the relevant legislation,142
NA,continue to be enforced.',142
NA,(2) At its 11th Session (7-11 December 1987),142
NA,the World Heritage Committee decided to include,142
NA,Stage II of Kakadu National Park in the World,142
NA,Heritage List. The Committee:,142
NA,'recalled that at its 5th session held in Sydney,142
NA,"(Australia) in 1981, while inscribing Kakadu",142
NA,"National Park on the World Heritage List, it had",142
NA,noted that the Australian Government intended,142
NA,to proclaim additional areas in the Alligator,142
NA,Rivers Region as part of Kakadu National Park,142
NA,and had recommended that such areas be includ-,142
NA,ed in the site inscribed on the World Heritage,142
NA,List. The. Committee therefore welcomed the,142
NA,"extension ·of the site to include such areas, which",142
NA,had been favourably reviewed by ICOMOS and,142
NA,mCN. The Committee accordingly decided to,142
NA,include Stage II in the site inscribed on the,142
NA,World Heritage List. The Committee commended,142
NA,the Australian authorities for having taken,142
NA,appropriate legislative measures to prohibit,142
NA,mineral exploration and mining and for their,142
NA,efforts to restore the natural ecosystems of the,142
NA,site. It also encouraged the Australian authorities,142
NA,to consider further'extending the World Heritage,142
NA,site to include Stage 3 of the National Park and,142
NA,to modify the boundaries of Stages 1 and 2 in,142
NA,"order to protect the entire catchment area, and to",142
NA,include the cultural values to the East of the,142
NA,present National Park.,142
NA,'Finally the Committee requested the Austral-,142
NA,ian authorities to provide further information on,142
NA,the possible impact of proposed military training,142

NA,Significant reforms to WorkCover were intro-,143
NA,duced in NSW through the Workers Compensation,143
NA,(Amendment) Act 1991. These include improve-,143
NA,ments to common law entitlements and the intro-,143
NA,duction of provision for a second injury scheme.,143
NA,The Queensland Parliament passed the Workers',143
NA,"Compensation Act 1990, which took effect from 1",143
NA,January 1991. The new Act retains the basic,143
NA,philosqphy of fairness and equity for employers and,143
NA,employees with work related injuries but new,143
NA,inlprovements in benefits for injured workers.,143
NA,Extensive amendments have been made to the,143
NA,WorkCover scheme in South Australia since,143
NA,September 1990. The major amendments are in,143
NA,relation to power to exclude certain workers from,143

NA,August 1991:,144
NA,"(1) On 14 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1973),",144
NA,did the then Minister for Foreign Affairs inform,144
NA,House that its unanimous resolution on the UN,144
NA,Convention on the Law of the Sea had been,144
NA,forn1ally conveyed to the US Government.,144
NA,(2) On what subsequent occasions and by what,144
NA,means has Australia's support for the Convention,144
NA,been conveyed to the USA.,144
NA,(3) Further to his answer to question No. 178,144
NA,"(Hansard, 18 September 1990, page 2125),",144
NA,consideration been given to,144
NA,objectives in the same way as they were successful-,144
NA,ly conveyed in June 1991 concerning the Protocol,144
NA,to the Antarctic Treaty.,144
Dr BLEWETT ,The answer to the honourable scale,144
NA,member's question is as follows:,144
NA,(1) Yes.,144
NA,(2) Australia has been in direct and,144
NA,contact with the United States Government over,144
NA,law of the sea issues since 1981 when the House,144
NA,of Representatives conveyed its unanimous resolu-,144
NA,tion on the United Nations Convention on the,144
NA,of the Sea to the United States Government. In,144
NA,"those contacts, Australia continues to emphasise",144
NA,"significance of the Convention, which embodies a",144
NA,"delicate balance of the interests of all States,",144
NA,establishing a comprehensive regime governing the,144
NA,uses of the ocean. In particular we stress to the,144
NA,United States Government the value to all members,144
NA,of the international community of the entry into,144
NA,force of a universally acceptable Convention.,144
NA,(3) The negotiation of the Protocol to the,144
NA,Antarctic Treaty differs substantially from the,144
NA,current situation regarding the United Nations,144
NA,Convention on the Law of the Sea. Negotiations on,144
NA,the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the,144
NA,Antarctic Treaty are still taking place. In June 1991,144
NA,the United States asked for more time to study a,144
NA,"compromise formula, which had been agreed to by",144
NA,"all the other Treaty Parties, on the last outstanding",144
NA,substantive issue for settlement of the Protocol. It,144
NA,was therefore appropriate for representations to be,144
NA,made to the United States. These were successful,144
NA,and on 4 July President Bush announced that the,144
NA,United States could accept the formula. The,144
NA,negotiations are due to be concluded and the,144
NA,Protocol opened for signature in October.,144
NA,In the case of the Law of the Sea Convention the,144
NA,situation is much more complicated and delicate.,144
NA,The negotiation of that Convention is long over.,144
NA,"Since 1982, the United States position has been that",144
NA,Part XI of the Convention dealing with deep seabed,144
NA,mining is unacceptable in its current form.,144
NA,the Australia and the United States are now participat-,144
NA,ing in consultations under the auspices of the UN,144
NA,Secretary-General to explore the scope for bringing,144
NA,into force a universally acceptable Convention.,144
NA,Bilateral Aid,144
NA,(Question No. 995),144
NA,Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Trade and,144
NA,"has Overseas Development, upon notice, on 21",144
NA,conveying Australia's August 1991:,144
NA,Further to the answers to questions Nos. 164,144
NA,"(Hansard, 7 November 1990, page 3505) and 850,",144
NA,"(Hansard, 20 August 1991, page 119), what is the",144
NA,and nature of direct bilateral aid to Vietnam,144
NA,"by (a) Japan, (b) Sweden and (c) Finland.",144
Dr BLEWETT ,The answer to the honourable,144
NA,regular member's question is as follows:,144
NA,"(a) In 1989, the last year for which figures are",144
NA,"available, Japanese aid to Vietnam amounted to",144
NA,$US 1.55 million. Of this technical assistance was,144
NA,Law $US 1.24 million and grant assistance was $US,144
NA,"310,000. This compares to Japan's total bilateral",144
NA,the aid expenditure of over $US 6 billion.,144
NA,Japan seeks to encourage Vietnam to be more,144
NA,in forthcoming in the Cambodia peace process and,144
NA,domestic economic reform. It is thus taking what,144
NA,it calls a cautious approach and will not resume a,144
NA,"full bilateral aid program, in terms of grants and",144
NA,"loans, until further progress is made on the Cambo-",144
NA,"dian question. Instead, Japan has expanded econom-",144
NA,ic cooperation from humanitarian aid to small scale,144
NA,technical assistance. For example the Japan Inter-,144
NA,national Cooperation Agency (nCA) has sent some,144
NA,experts to Vietnam and is gradually increasing the,144
NA,number of Vietnamese trainees (economic managers,144
NA,and medical students etc.) in Japan. Japan hopes to,145
NA,increase this to 50 over the 1991-92 Japanese,145
NA,financial year.,145
NA,(b) Sweden's bilateral development assistance,145
NA,program to Vietnam for the 1990-91 financial year,145
NA,was 300 million Krona or SUS 47.8 million.,145
NA,Direct Government to Government aid to,145
NA,Vietnam was scaled down from 1987 and was to,145
NA,be suspended from 1990 unless Vietnam withdrew,145
NA,its forces from Cambodia. Sweden's Minister for,145
NA,"Development Cooperation, Hjelm-Wallen, an-",145
NA,nounced a resumption of the normal bilateral aid,145
NA,program during her visit to Vietnam in June 1990.,145
NA,The principal projects are industrial rehabilitation,145
NA,(providing mainly equipment and some technical,145
NA,"advice and training), health and reafforestation.",145
NA,(c) Finland plans to provide SUS 14.2 million or,145
NA,60 million Finnish Markka by the 1991 calendar,145
NA,year and to increase this to SUS 16.6 million or 70,145
NA,million Finnish Markka in 1993. Most of this will,145
NA,be grant aid with a small but significant amount in,145
NA,the form of technical cooperation.,145
NA,"During the three years to 1990, no new projects",145
NA,were commenced due to Vietnam's military,145
NA,presence in Cambodia at that time.,145
NA,The principal projects include a vocational school,145
NA,"attached to a repair dock in Pha Rung, an urban",145
NA,water supply project for Hanoi and a feasibility,145
NA,study for a similar water supply project for Hai,145
NA,Phong. A container port for Ho Chi Minh City is,145

NA,"Affairs, upon notice, on 21 August 1991:",145
NA,What developments have taken place in the (a),145
NA,Parliaments and (b) courts of (i) !Queensland,145

NA,"(Hansard, 8 November 1990, page 3074) and 536",145
NA,"(Hansard, 7 May 1991, page 3169).",145
NA,Mr Tickner-The answer to the honour-,145
NA,able member's question is as follows:,145
NA,(i) (a) In respect of the Archer River property in,145
NA,"Queensland, I am advised that under the provisions",145
NA,"of the recently enacted Aboriginal Land Act 1991,",145
NA,"National Parks are available Crown lands, which",145
NA,upon declaration by the Governor in Council by,145
NA,"Gazette notice, can become land that may be",145
NA,claimed and granted to a group of Aboriginal,145
NA,people. It has been announced by the Queensland,145
NA,Government that following upon proclamation of,145
NA,"the Act, the National Park at Archer River will be",145
NA,declared by the Governor in Council as claimable,145
NA,land.,145
NA,(b) I am advised that there have been no further,145
NA,developments in the courts on this matter.,145
NA,(ii) (a) The Western Australian Government had,145
NA,moved to amend its Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972-,145
NA,80 to bind the Crown except in instances where,145
NA,emergency public works may interfere with,145
NA,"Aboriginal sites. As previously advised, the",145
NA,Amendment Bill has been withdrawn from the,145
NA,Western Australian Legislative Council for further,145
NA,amendment and has not been re-introduced in,145
NA,Parliament.,145
NA,(b) The Western Australian Government has,145
NA,appealed to the State Full Court against the finding,145
NA,of the Supreme Court that the Premier's approval,145
NA,of the redevelopment of the brewery building was,145
NA,void. The Court has reserved its decision.,145
NA,Commonwealth Grants to Schools,145
NA,(Question No. 1000),145
NA,Mrs Bailey asked the Minister for Employ-,145
NA,"ment, Education and Training, upon notice, on",145
NA,21 August 1991:,145
NA,(1) Are Commonwealth grants to schools needed,145
NA,at the start of the school year to enable schools to,145
NA,purchase books and equipment.,145
NA,(2) Was the delivery of Commonwealth grants to,145
NA,"schools changed in January 1991, without warning,",145
NA,"to quarterly payments; if so, why.",145
NA,Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honour-,145
NA,able member's question is as follows:,145
NA,(1) Commonwealth general recurrent grants are,145
NA,provided to State and Territory government educa-,145
NA,tion systems and to approved non-government,145
NA,schools and systems.,145
NA,Grants to government school systems are paid in,145
NA,twelve monthly instalments.,145
NA,Commonwealth General Recurrent Grants are,145
NA,paid to non-government schools and systems as,145
NA,follows:,145
NA,50 per cent in January,145
NA,25 per cent in July (cumulative total 75 per cent),145
NA,25 per cent in October (cumulative total 100 per,145
NA,cent),145
NA,Commonwealth grants therefore commence being,145
NA,paid before the start of the school year.,145
NA,(2) The only change made in January 1991 to,146
NA,payment of grants was the change to General,146
NA,Recurrent Grant payments to non-government,146
NA,school systems from:,146
NA,25 per cent in January,146
NA,25 per cent in April (cumulative total 50 per,146
NA,cent),146
NA,25 per cent in July (cumulative total 75 per cent),146
NA,25 per cent in October (cumulative total 100 per,146
NA,cent),146
NA,to:,146
NA,50 per cent in January,146
NA,25 per cent in July (cumulative total 75 per cent),146
NA,25 per cent in October (cumulative total 100 per,146
NA,cent),146
NA,The changed payment arrangement was done in,146
NA,consultation with system representatives.,146
NA,The reason for this change was to bring systemic,146
NA,schools into line with the payment arrangements for,146
NA,"non-systemic schools, and to provide additional",146
NA,assistance towards the costs of teacher award,146
NA,restructuring.,146
NA,Oaths and Affirmations,146
NA,(Question No. 1001),146
NA,"Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General,",146
NA,"upon notice, on 21 August 1991:",146
NA,When did the Government last consider the form,146
NA,of the (a) oaths and affirmations of allegiance and,146
NA,of office to be taken by (i) Justices of the High,146
NA,Court under the Judiciary Act 1903 and (ii) Judges,146
NA,under the (A) Australian Capital Territory Supreme,146
NA,Court Act and (B) Family Law Act 1975 and (b),146
NA,oath or affirmation of office taken by Judges under,146
NA,the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976.,146
Mr DUFFY ,The answer to the honourable,146
NA,member's question is as follows:,146
NA,The oath or affirmation of allegiance as con-,146
NA,tained in the Schedule to the Constitution was last,146
NA,considered by the Government in 1988. The oath,146
NA,or affirmation of office for Justices or Judges as,146
NA,contained in the relevant Acts was last considered,146
NA,in;,146
NA,(a) (i) 1979 (High Court Act 1979).,146

NA,"' Mr Mack asked the Minister for the Arts,",146
NA,"I Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territor-",146
NA,"ies, upon notice, on 21 August 1991:",146
NA,(1) Were companies which manufacture cigar-,146
NA,ettes in Australia licensed by the R. J. Reynolds,146
NA,company of the USA to use a Reynolds' patented,146
NA,process involving the treatment of tobacco with,146
NA,"Freon; if so, which companies.",146
NA,(2) Are any companies in Australia using any,146
NA,process involving the treatment of tobacco with,146
NA,"Freon; if so, which companies.",146
NA,(3) Is Freon a trade name for a chlorofluoro-,146
NA,carbon (CFC) gas.,146
NA,(4) Is she able to say whether there are any,146
NA,benefits to (a) the manufacturer or (b) the public,146
NA,"from treating tobacco with CFCs; if so, what are",146
NA,the benefits.,146
NA,(5) Does the treatment of tobacco with CFCs,146
NA,accord with the Government's objectives concern-,146
NA,"ing the use of ozone depleting gases; if not, will",146
NA,the Government review this use of CFCs.,146
Mrs KELLY ,The answer to the honourable,146
NA,member's question is as follows:,146
NA,(1) Licensing arrangements between companies,146
NA,"are private contracts, details of which usually",146
NA,remain confidential between the parties concerned.,146
NA,(2) No.,146
NA,(3) Yes.,146
NA,(4) Until recently CFC was used for loosening or,146
NA,fluffing tobacco compressed for transport. Release,146
NA,of pressure fluffs the tobacco ready for filling,146
NA,cigarettes. Alternative methods are now used.,146
NA,(5) The elimination of CFC from the process is,146
NA,consistent with the Government's objectives of,146
NA,phasing out ozone depleting substances.,146
NA,Cigarettes: Taxation,146
NA,(Question No. 1008),146
NA,Mr Mack asked the Minister for Small,146
NA,"Business and Customs, upon notice, on 21",146
NA,August 1991:,146
NA,(1) Is he able to say whether cigarette manufac-,146
NA,turers in Australia treat tobacco with chlorofluoro-,146
NA,carbons to reduce the amount and weight of,146
NA,tobacco required to produce a given number of,146
NA,"cigarettes; if so, does the Government collect less",147
NA,revenue from cigarette manufacturers because the,147
NA,relevant taxes are levied by weight.,147
NA,(2) Is he able to say whether taxes in the USA,147
NA,"are levied per thousand cigarettes; if so, would",147
NA,revenue be increased if Australian cigarette taxes,147
NA,were levied in the same manner.,147
NA,Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable,147
NA,member's question is as follows:,147
NA,(1) I am advised that Australian cigarette manu-,147
NA,facturers no longer treat tobacco with chlorofluoro-,147
NA,carbons (CFC's). Excise on tobacco and cigarettes,147
NA,is currently based on tobacco weight and not on the,147
NA,number of cigarettes produced. The Government,147
NA,thus does not collect less revenue per weight of,147
NA,tobacco consumption if expansion agents are used.,147
NA,"(2) In the United States, excise on cigarettes is",147
NA,levied per thousand cigarettes.,147
NA,I understand that the current US taxes are $10,147
NA,per 1000 for 'small' cigarettes and $21 per 1000,147
NA,for 'large' cigarettes.,147
NA,"If excise were levied per cigarette, rather than",147
NA,"per kilogram of tobacco, the revenue effect would",147
NA,depend on the rates chosen.,147
NA,The methodology for levying excise and the,147
NA,setting of rates to achieve certain revenue expecta-,147
NA,-ions are matters for my colleague the Treasurer,147
NA,and are under continuing review.,147
NA,Carriage Of Grain: Regulation,147
NA,(Question No. 1016),147
NA,Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Land,147
NA,"Transport, upon notice, on 22 August 1991:",147
NA,(1) Did wheat marketing legislation enacted in,147
NA,1989 allow for the deregulation of the domestic,147
NA,carriage of grain.,147
NA,(2) Does the Victorian Government continue to,147
NA,regulate the carriage of grain to rail.,147
NA,(3) If the legislation referred to in part (1) has,147
NA,been implemented and the Victorian Government,147
NA,"continues to regulate the carriage of grain, why",147
NA,does he allow the situation to continue.,147
NA,Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the,147
NA,honourable member's question is as follows:,147
NA,(1) The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 allowed for,147
NA,the deregulation of the domestic carriage of grain.,147
NA,"However, this deregulation only applies to grain",147
NA,which is the subject of a contract relating to,147
NA,state or export trade. The Federal Government does,147
NA,not have the Constitutional power to legislate on,147
NA,intra-state trading in grain.,147
NA,(2) The Victorian Government continues to,147
NA,regulate to rail the transport of grains over a,147
NA,distance of 60 km where the grain is transported,147
NA,"only within Victoria, unless the vehicle is owned",147
NA,by the grain grower.,147
NA,(3) The Victorian Government is acting within,147
NA,its powers under the Constitution to regulate the,147
NA,transport of grain which is the subject of intra-state,147
NA,trade. The Commonwealth's powers under the,147
NA,Constitution cover interstate and export trade only.,147
NA,The Federal Government adopted the recommen-,147
NA,dations of the Royal Commission into Grains,147
NA,"Storage, Handling and Transport in 1988 which",147
NA,included a recommendation that this restriction be,147
NA,"removed. However, it was recognised that imple-",147
NA,mentation of most of the findings was a matter for,147
NA,the States which to a large extent have not agreed,147
NA,to the Royal Commission recommendations.,147
NA,Assets Sales,147
NA,(Question No. 1017),147
NA,"Mr Beale asked the Minister for Finance,",147
NA,"upon notice, on 22 August 1991:",147
NA,Further to the information set out in 1991-92,147
NA,"Budget paper No.2 at Table 1, 9D concerning",147
NA,"assets sales receipts, payments and totals and the",147
NA,details of assets sales set out at pages 3.289-294 of,147

NA,the receipts and payments for each of the assets,147
NA,proposed to be sold during 1991-92 and (b) the,147
NA,reconciliation of those figures.,147
Mr WILLIS ,The answer to the honourable,147
NA,member's questions is as follows:,147
NA,"(a) and (b) No. For obvious commercial reasons,",147
NA,it is not the practice of the Government to release,147
NA,estimates of the expected receipts (and associated,147
NA,payments) in respect of individual asset sales which,147
NA,have yet to be finalised. The release of such figures,147
NA,would be prejudicial to the Commonwealth's,147

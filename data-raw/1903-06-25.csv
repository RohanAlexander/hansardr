NA,"of State for the Colonies, dated Melbourne,",12
NA,"30th September, 1902, the following sen-",12
NA,tence occurs:-,12
NA,lt seems to me important that these regula-,12
NA,tions should be drawn up and approved or by,12
NA,Parliament as explanatory of the Kanaka Bill be-,12
NA,fore the Royal assent is given.,12
NA,I wish to know from the Prime Minister,12
NA,whether that suggestion; and the com-,12
NA,"munication, generally, was despatched by",12
NA,the Governor-General on the advice of his,12
NA,responsible Ministers? I f the Governor-,12
NA,"General was not acting on such advice, has",12
NA,the Prime Minister communicated with him,12
NA,in such a way as will protect the rights of,12
NA,responsible government within the Com-,12
NA,monwealth ?,12
Sir EDMUND BARTON , The de-,12
NA,spatch in question has not been considered,12
NA,by the Cabinet; but I have ascertained from,12
NA,"the Governor-General that, although it has",12
NA,been included among the papers laid before,12
NA,"Parliament in England, it was confidential.",12
Mr FISHER ,I t is not so marked.,12
Sir EDMUND BARTON ,I t does not ',12
NA,"appear to be so marked, but His Excellency",12
NA,assures me that that is the fact. The,12
NA,honorable member asked me whether the,12
NA,hod advised His Excellency the,12
NA,Governor-General in tliis - matter. Upon,12
NA,that point I may say that the despatch was ',12
NA,evidently written by His Excellency confi-,12
NA,"dentially, in the course of his own relations",12
NA,the Secretary of State for the Colonies.,12
NA,With respect to communications of that,12
NA,kind it is.not the practice to consult Minis-,12
NA,ters.,12
NA,PRESS ACCOMMODATION.,12
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Som e days ago,12
NA,"I brought under your notice, Mr Speaker, the",12
NA,fact that the press representatives from the,12
NA,other States were being put to considerable,12
NA,inconvenience owing to their having no,13
NA,room set apart for their use. I know that,13
NA,you arc anxious to do everything you can,13
NA,to provide facilities for those who have,13
NA,duties to perform in connexion with our,13
NA,proceedings; but as three or four weeks,13
NA,"have elapsed, and no room has been allotted",13
NA,"to these press representatives, I should be",13
NA,very glad i f you could see your wa)' to,13
NA,meet their wishes as speedily as possible.,13
Mr SPEAKER , ! fully recognise the,13
NA,importance of providing for the press repre-,13
NA,"sentatives a room, i f possible on the same",13
NA,"floor as this chamber, in which the}' can",13
NA,transcribe their notes. Several of the press,13
NA,representatives waited upon me at the,13
NA,beginning of the session with regard to this,13
NA,"matter, and T told them that i f there was",13
NA,any room on this side of the building that,13
NA,"would be suitable for their purposes, they",13
NA,"need only direct my attention to it, and I",13
NA,would place i t at their disposal. I under-,13
NA,"stand that there is no such room available,",13
NA,"and I can, therefore, do nothing. I believe,",13
NA,"however, that there is a probability of",13
NA,another room on the other side of the,13
NA,"building, which is not under my control,",13
NA,being placed at their disposal shortly.,13
NA,ELECTORAL ROLLS.,13
Mr SKENE , the Minister for Home,13
NA,"Affairs, upon notice-",13
NA,Whether he has any intention of affording the,13
NA,Federal electors of Victoria a similar opportunity,13
NA,to that which he is giving the electors of New,13
NA,South Wales to inspect the rolls at the various,13
NA,"post-offices throughout the State ; and, if not,",13
NA,does he intend by any other means whatever to,13
NA,attempt to correct the apparently inaccurate rolls,13
NA,upon which the maps forfcheredistribution of,13
NA,electorates in the State of Victoria are based ?,13
Sir EDMUND BARTON ,Th e answer,13
NA,"to the honorable member's question, supplied",13
NA,"to me by the Minister for Home Affairs, is",13
NA,as follows :-,13
NA,The franchise of New South Wales closely,13
NA,"approximates to that of the Commonwealth, and",13
NA,the rolls of that State are being utilized very,13
NA,"largely by me at a trifling expense, but the",13
NA,Victorian franchise diverges to such an extent,13
NA,from that of the Commonwealth that the rolls are,13
NA,of little or no service for the purposes of com-,13
NA,"parison, and ascertaining what male or female",13
NA,electors liave been omitted by the police in their,13
NA,canvass. The printing of the rolls collected by,13
NA,"the police would involve an expenditure of £3,500,",13
NA,and would be in such a form (the State districts),13
NA,that they could nofc be utilized for any other,13
NA,purpose in the Electoral Act subsequently. I,13
NA,"am, however, preparing lists showing the names",13
NA,"of electors grouped round polling places, which",13
NA,will be placed in the hands of the printer within,13
NA,"few days, and as soon as printed will be exhibited",13
NA,"at post-offices, State schools, and police offices,",13
NA,"for the information of electors, who will thus be",13
NA,in a position to ascertain whether their names,13
NA,have been included or nofc. This is being done in,13
NA,"anticipation of the Revision Court, which cannot",13
NA,be held until after the divisions of the State have,13
NA,been approved by both Houses of Parliament.,13
NA,FEMALE TELEPHON E OPERATORS.,13
NA,"Mr MCDONALD, for Mr HUGHES, asked",13
NA,"the Minister for Home Affairs, upon",13
NA,notice-,13
NA,1. Whether the female telephone operators in,13
NA,the New South Wales General Post-office have,13
NA,to pass any examination before being eligible to,13
NA,receive the minimum wage of £110 per annum?,13
NA,"2. If not, whether there are any qualifications",13
NA,other than age and length of service iis pre-,13
NA,scribed by fche Commonwealth Public Service,13
NA,Act?,13
Sir EDMUND BARTON ,Theanswer s,13
NA,to the honorable and learned member's,13
NA,"questions, supplied fco me by the Minister",13
NA,"for Home Affairs, are as follow :-",13
NA,1. No.,13
NA,2. No other qualifications are required than,13

Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Macquarie) -,13
NA,I desire to bring under the notice of honor-,13
NA,able members a matter of very great im-,13
NA,portance. I asked the Attorney-General,13
NA,a question some days ago with reference to,13
NA,"the case of Mr Goldring, and the Minister",13
NA,in his reply mentioned that the case was,13
NA,"then sub judice, because certain proceedings",13
NA,had been instituted against the Govern-,13
NA,ment. I have since consulted the honor-,13
NA,"able and learned member for Illawarra,",13
NA,the honorable and learned member for,13
NA,"Parkes, and the honorable and learned",13
NA,"member for South Australia, Mr Glynn,",13
NA,"and others, who assure me that until a writ",13
NA,is issued a case cannot be said to be sub j u - -,13
NA,dice. I n order to make sure that no writ had,13
NA,"been issued, I telegraphed to Sydney yes-",13
NA,"a terday, and received a reply that matters",13
NA,had nofc yet reached that stage. I under-,14
NA,stand an application has been made in,14
NA,"respect to an overpayment of duty, and ifc",14
NA,"has been necessary to adopt this course,",14
NA,because i f the overpayment is not claimed,14
NA,within six months i t will be forfeited. I,14
NA,mention these facts in justification of my,14
NA,present action in bringing this matter before,14
NA,honorable members. So far as the merits of,14
NA,"the case are concerned, I can only give",14
NA,the facts as they are submitted to me.,14
NA,Honorable members must see from fche,14
NA,petition presented to-day that a very strong,14
NA,case has been made out against the Govern-,14
NA,ment. Mr Goldring does not fear to have,14
NA,"his case debated, in the f u l l light of day. He",14
NA,has repeatedly appealed to the Customs,14
NA,"authorities, and lias also asked the law",14
NA,courts to insist thafc the Government should,14
NA,"return his books and papers, or give some",14
NA,reason for retaining them. The Govern-,14
NA,ment instructed Sir Julian Salomons to,14
NA,"undertake -their defence, and to raise the",14
NA,"point that the courts had no jurisdiction,",14
NA,and as the court supported that view Mr.,14
NA,Goldring was unable to obtain any redress.,14
NA,I have a summary of the whole of the facts,14
NA,of the case which I shall proceed to lay,14
NA,before honorable members. I t is as fol-,14
NA,lows :-,14

NA,Ofllered guarantee or deposit to any amount re-,14

Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Yes .,14
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,This is surely,14

Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I t looks as i f,14

NA,"Mr Goldring incriminate himself, but he",14
NA,"refused to sign the bond, and its form was",14

NA,They endeavoured fco induce Mr Goldring,14
NA,to incriminate himself,14
Mr KINGSTON ,Nonsense .,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Th e Minister,14
NA,will have an opportunity of contradicting,14
NA,me i f he can.,14
Mr LE GROOM ,Who Was tlie officer,14
NA,concerned 1,14
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I have not the,14
NA,"name of the officer, but that is a matter of",14
NA,"no importance, because fche Minister is re-",14
NA,sponsible. Mr Golding has nofc been able,14
NA,to obtain any satisfaction from the Customs,14
NA,"authorities, and he is now appealing to the",14
NA,"House tp grant him redress, and has the",14
NA,as the\' same right in that respect as any other,14
NA,citizen who may consider himself aggrieved.,14
NA,I did nofc meet Mr Goldring until after the,14
NA,facts of his case had been reported in the,15
NA,newspapers. When I referred to this mat-,15
NA,"ter some weeks ago, I did not even know",15
NA,who Mr Goldring was. From the facts,15
NA,"published in the press, however, I gathered",15
NA,"that he had been very harshly treated, and",15

NA,manded was : - I hereby deposit,15

Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Did the Cus-,15
NA,toms authorities show the cost price of the,15
NA,goods to his customers 1,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I am informed,15
NA,being that they did. I am simply stating the,15
NA,facts as they have been presented to me.,15
NA,Honorable members will then be able to,15
NA,arrive at their own conclusions after hearing,15

NA,"I pause here, because i t may be said",15
NA,that the Department agreed to accept,15
NA,a bond i n connexion with the goods; but,15
NA,I would point out that the letter of the,15
NA,25th February relates onlyfcocertain jewel-,15
NA,"lery and some free goods, and has no refer-",15
NA,ence whatever to the watches. Ifc has no,15
NA,"reference to the original seizure, but was",15

NA,25th February cable from principals-Foreig n,15

NA,"That is to say, this firm actually had to",15
NA,appeal to the Swiss Minister- a large,15
NA,quantity of the goods came from Switzer-,15

NA,The Swiss Minister communicated with,15
NA,"Lord Lansdowne, asking him to see thafc",15
NA,the business carried on by the firm in Aus-,15
NA,tralia was not interfered with and practi-,15
NA,cally closed for seven or eight months.,15
Mr THOMSON ,Goldrin g could nofc get,15
NA,"his goods, nor any reason for the with-",15
NA,"holding of them, notwithstanding that the",15
NA,Department would not take action against,15
NA,him.,15
Mr DEAKIN ,These ' are all ex-parte,15
NA,statements.,15
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I repeat that,15
NA,I am detailing the facts as they have been,15
NA,presented to me. The action of the Customs,15
NA,authorities during the last few days goes to,15
NA,show that i t does nofc think thafc Goldring,16
NA,should be proceeded against criminally. As,16
NA,I stated in the discussion which took place,16
NA,"upon the Address i n Reply, i f he has",16
NA,been guilty of any fraud I would nofc at-,16
NA,"tempt to justify him, and proceedings should",16
NA,be instituted against him. But certainly,16
NA,his goods should nofc be seized and his books,16
NA,detained for eight months without any rea-,16
NA,sonable cause.,16
Mr CONROY ,N o doubt -the Minister,16
NA,for Trade and Customs has had a quarrel,16
NA,with him.,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I have no date?,16
NA,desire fco introduce the personal element,16
NA,into this debate. Mr Goldring has ap-,16
NA,"pealed to the Law Courts in vain, and now",16
NA,he appeals to fchis House. I repeat thafc,16
NA,the bond which was asked for by fche,16
NA,Department could not possibly have any,16
NA,"reference to the consignment of watches,",16
NA,because upon the 25th March,16
Mr THOMSON ,H e had offered to enter,16
NA,into any bond fchafc the Department might,16
NA,require.,16
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,U p,16
NA,"period, was an embargo placed upon the",16
NA,whole of his watches?,16
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Yes ! So,16
NA,seriously did fche action of the Customs,16
NA,"Department interfere with his business,",16
NA,that I understand he communicated with,16
NA,the London firm advising them not to send,16
NA,any more goods to Australia until this,16
NA,matter had been settled. Still quoting from,16

Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Exactly . There,16
NA,"of could have been no suspicion of fraud,",16
NA,otherwise the Minister for Trade and Cus-,16

NA,"were instead, the Department, after holding",16
NA,"Goldring's goods, books, and invoices for",16
NA,intimatedfchafcifc was quite,16
NA,willing to allow delivery of the goods,16
NA,reason practically under Goldring's own terms.,16
NA,"Mr Goldring went to Sydney, and, in pur-",16
NA,of fche agreement entered into in,16
NA,"Melbourne with Mr Smart, made applica-",16
NA,tion for the goods in possession of the,16
NA,Sydney Customs authorities to be handed,16
NA,and over to him. The goods in Sydney were of,16
NA,same value as those which i n Melbourne,16
NA,had been delivered ; but Mr Lockyer in Syd-,16
NA,"ney demanded security equal to 25 per cent,",16
NA,"he on the invoice value, and a cash deposit of",16
NA,"bhe 25 per cent, extra, refusing to adopt the",16
NA,; and course which had been followed in Mel-,16
NA,bourne. On the 12th of June a letter was,16
NA,received by Mr Goldring i n reply to tbe,17
NA,"letter of the ' 9 t h of t h a t month, stating",17
NA,t h a t the matter had been referred to the,17
NA,"Attorney-General i n M e l b o u r n e ; and, I",17
NA,"believe, t h a t last Friday , the 19th inst.,",17
NA,tbe Melbourne Collector of Customs ad-,17
NA,vised the Sydney Customs officers t h a t,17
NA,they should accept the value placed on the,17
NA,"goods by Mr Goldring, plus 10 per cent.",17
NA,"Mr Goldring, as I have said, was referred",17
NA,"to the Crown Solicitor on several occasions,",17
NA,and on 9th M a y of this year Mr Goldring,17
NA,wrote the following letter to the Collector,17
NA,of Customs :-,17
NA,lie entry for one box watches. Duty paid,17
NA,"1.5,03-W . 17.1. Having called repeatedly since",17
NA,"4.5.03 respecting these goods, must now ask",17
NA,you to kindly favour us with reply as to whether,17
NA,we can obtain delivery of them or not.,17
NA,"On 11th M a y , Mr Lockyer, the",17
NA,"of Customs, replied as follows :-",17
NA,I beg to acknowledge receipt of j'our letter of,17
NA,the Sth instant relative to a box of watches which,17
NA,"formed the subject of previous correspondence,",17
NA,and would suggest that you communicate with,17
NA,the State Crown Solicitor.,17
NA,"MY. M i t c h e l l , acting f o r Mr Goldring,",17
NA,communicated w i t h the Crown Solicitor i n,17
NA,the following terms :-,17
NA,"My client, Mr Goldring, has been writing to",17
NA,the Collector of Customs with respect to the,17
NA,"further stoppage of his goods, and in a letter to",17
NA,him by the Collector of Customs of the 21st,17
NA,instant he has been referred to you. I under-,17
NA,stand that the Collector made some remark to his,17
NA,clerk about the inability to get the goods on get-,17
NA,"ting some bond ; but my client, writing for par-",17
NA,"ticulars, he was only referred to you. May I ask",17
NA,you to furnish a reply to my client's letter ?,17
NA,Mr M i t c h e ll had been referred to the Crown,17
NA,"Solicitor some days previously, and, on the",17
NA,"4th of the month, he wrote this second least",17
NA,letter to t h a t official-,17
NA,"On the 27th ulto., I wrote you for information",17
NA,respecting Mr Goldring's goods which were being,17
NA,detained at the Customs. I sent this letter on to,17
NA,"you, as my client was referred to you by the Col-",17
NA,lector of CustomsMay I ask for the favour of,17
NA,un immediate reply. I am writing to the Col-,17
NA,lector of Customs also on the matter.,17
NA,On 4 t h June Mr ' M i t c h e ll addressed the,17
NA,following letter to the Collector of Cus-,17
NA,toms :-,17
NA,Mr Goldring handed me your letter of the 21st,17
NA,"ulto., wherein you referred him to the Crown",17
NA,"Solicitor. 1 have written to the Crown Solicitor,",17
NA,and am writing him again to-day. May I ask,17
NA,"the favour of a reply to my client's letter, either",17
NA,by yourself or by the Crown Solicitor without,17
NA,further delay. I may mention that my client,17
NA,endeavoured to get his goods in Melbourne and,17
NA,"offered a bond, but his agents, after repeated",17
NA,"inquiries, were informed that although the goods",17
NA,"could be got upon giving a bond, bhey could not",17
NA,"furnish a bond or particulars, as the papers were",17
NA,"with the Crown Solicitor, and bhey could nob see",17
NA,bheir wa3' clear bo geb bhem.,17
NA,On 6 t h June Mr Lockyer replied as f o l-,17
NA,lows :-,17
NA,I beg to acknowledge receipt of j'onr letter of,17
NA,"the 4th inst.,'relative to a letter addressed from",17
NA,this office to Mr Magnus Goldring in which he,17
NA,was refeired to the Crown Solicitor bo whom I,17
NA,have forwarded j'our letter.,17
NA,T h a t is a l l the i n f o r m a t i o n which could be,17
NA,obtained f r o m the Crown Solicitor. Ifc w i l l,17
NA,be observed that i n the f i r s t instance Mr .,17
NA,Goldrin g was referred to Melbourne f o r i n -,17
NA,"formation, and when he there applied to the",17
NA,"Minister, he was told t h a t the matter was",17
NA,"i n the hands of the Crown Solicitor, who,",17
NA,"i n t u r n , admitted t h a t he knew very l i t t l e",17
NA,Collector of the circumstances. I t w i l l be f u r t h e r,17
NA,observed t h a t Mr Goldring could not obtain,17
NA,replies to his letters. Mr Goldring sums up,17
NA,his complaints against the M i n i s t er f o r,17
NA,"Trade and Customs, or the Customs au-",17
NA,"thorities, as f o l l o w s : -",17
NA,1. That letters and telegrams of bhe utmost,17
NA,then importance have never been answered or even,17
NA,acknowledged.,17
NA,2. Thab bhey seized my books and invoices seven,17
NA,"months ago, and are still detaining them, without",17
NA,giving any reason for so doing.,17
NA,3. Thab bhey sbopped my imports throughout,17
NA,"the Commonwealbh, refusing or ignoring my",17
NA,"offers of cash deposit, bank guarantee, or bo sug-",17
NA,gest any bernis on which I could obbain delivery,17
NA,bo enable me bo carry on my business.,17

NA,opened my goods in bond and extracted samples,17
NA,"bherefrom. Goods referred to-X over 1272, case",17
NA,"jewellery, ex Omrali.",17
NA,5. That in order to obtain valuations they have,17
NA,"exposed my imports, prices, and trade secrets to",17
NA,"my competitors and clients, and in one case at",17
NA,have resorted bo absolute falsehood to obtain,17
NA,their ends.,17
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h e r e is an,17
NA,indictment! - .,17
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I t is an indict-,17
NA,ment which the M i n i s t e r w i l l have to,17
NA,answer. Mr Goldring's summary' of his,17
NA,complaints proceeds-,17
NA,"6. Under clause 38, I have had to attend the",17
NA,"Collector of Customs, -at bhe Sydne3' Customs",17
NA,"House (16th February), and though no reason",17
NA,"was given, was put through severe cross-examina-",17
NA,bion-Reporte r being present behind screen.,17
NA,7. That an endeavour was made to force me,17
NA,"into signing, under threats of seizure, a guarantee",17
NA,form as follows :-,17
NA,""" I herebj' deposit £ being amount of",17
NA,"duby short paid,"" by which bhe depositor in-",17
NA,"criminates himself. This I refused, to do, and I",17
NA,finally secured the addition only of the word,17
NA,""" claimed"" before signing.",17
NA,Ifc -will be seen that i n the first place an,18
NA,attempt was made to get Mr Goldring fco,18
NA,"incriminate himself, and, that attempt fail-",18
NA,"ing, the Customs authorities altered the",18
NA,guarantee form i n the manner indicated.,18
NA,S. That fche actions of fche Department were,18
NA,such fchafc they must have been aware that i t,18
NA,would be ruin to the commercial interests and,18
NA,reputation of the firms I represent and myself.,18
NA,I f Mr Goldring had signed this gua-,18
NA,rantee form the Minister would be,18
NA,in a position to say that he had,18
NA,"admitted short payment i n fche duty,",18
NA,and had thus incriminated himself as a,18
NA,"person who had attempted to commit, a",18
NA,fraud on fche Customs Department. B u t,18
NA,Mr Goldring refused to do anything of the,18
NA,kind ; and eventually the Customs authori-,18
NA,ties altered the words of the guarantee,18
NA,form.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h e y accepted,18
NA,Mr Goldring's word.,18
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Tha t is so.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h e n why did,18
NA,Mr Goldring not get the goods?,18
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I understand,18
NA,thatfchisis one of the cases i n which Mr .,18
NA,Goldring did get fche goods; but fche Cus-,18
NA,toms authorities subsequently made a de-,18
NA,mand for the goods to be returned.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,Bu t,18
NA,Goldring was willing to give a bond i n,18
NA,every case.,18
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , Mr Goldring,18
NA,"was willingfcogive any bond, but he could",18
NA,not get the goods. Mr Goldring's sum-,18
NA,mary proceeds-,18
NA,9. That for a period extending over nearly,18
NA,"twelve months, tliey have collected invoices, & c ,",18
NA,"from my customers, without giving any reason.",18
NA,"Having started in Tasmania in July last, fchey",18
NA,have pursued this course through South Aus-,18
NA,"tralia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queens-",18
NA,land.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h e Customs,18
NA,authorities seem to have a regular criminal,18
NA,jurisdiction.,18
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , Mr Goldring,18
NA,further states- .,18
NA,"As recently as March last, they were",18
NA,"heard of in Mackay and Bundaberg, although",18
NA,since 17th November last fchey have held my,18
NA,"private stock book, which gives them every",18
NA,"detail, viz., cost and selling prices, when and to",18
NA,"whom sold, and although both the firms whom I",18
NA,represent and I have ottered the fullest informa-,18
NA,tion and courted every inquiry both here and in,18
NA,London.,18
NA,10. That they have unlawfully detained free,18
NA,"goods for days, and have endeavoured to force me",18
NA,to give a security bond for tbem.,18
NA,"Of course ifc is difficult, if not impossible,",18
NA,for a private member to make as full an,18
NA,inquiry as can be made by the Customs,18
NA,authorities into matters of this kind. What-,18
NA,"I complain of is, that the Customs authori-",18
NA,"ties, as far back as 17th November of last",18
NA,"year, seized Mr Goldring's goods, and have",18
NA,since refused either to give them up or state,18
NA,"any reason why they are detained, although",18
NA,Mr Goldring has throughout been willing,18
NA,"to deposit any reasonable amount, or t o",18
NA,enter into any reasonable bond.,18
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I f Mr Gold-,18
NA,ring had committed an offence the Customs,18
NA,authorities ought to have prosecuted.,18
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I am now,18
NA,speaking on the authority of the informa-,18
NA,tion at my disposal; and honorable mem-,18
NA,bers know wellfchafchad Mr Goldring been,18
NA,"guilty of any fraud, ifc is nofc likely that the",18
NA,invoices submitted i n November last year,18
NA,would have been accepted on 6th June this,18
NA,"year, unless the authorities were satisfied",18
NA,fchafc his conduct was honorable and straight-,18
NA,forward. I f Mr Goldring had undervalued,18
NA,"the goods, or had attempted any kind of",18
NA,"fraud, i t wasfcheclear duty of the Customs",18
NA,authorities to immediately inquire into the,18
NA,"case, and to institute a prosecution. B u t",18
NA,Mr.,18
NA,the Customs authorities never attempted,18
NA,"to do anything of the kind, and have af-",18
NA,forded no reasons whatever for the course,18
NA,they adopted. The papers to which I have,18
NA,"referred show that Mr Goldring applied,",18
NA,"not once or twice, but dozens of times to",18
NA,"the Customs authorities, and, i n asking for",18
NA,"delivery, offered, as I have said, to make",18
NA,any reasonable cash deposit or enter,18
NA,into any bond which might be desired.,18
NA,Prom the Customs authorities Mr Goldring,18
NA,"applied to the Supreme Court, which was",18
NA,"the only tribunal available, as Parliament",18
NA,was not i n session; and the Attorney-,18
NA,"General instructed Sir Julian Salomons, the",18
NA,"leading counsel in New South Wales, t o",18
NA,"raise the question of no jurisdiction, and by",18
NA,tliis means prevented Mr Goldring from,18
NA,» obtaining redress. The position taken up by,18
NA,Mr Goldring was that the Customs authori-,18
NA,ties must either return the goods or give rea-,18
NA,sons for detaining them. A l l he asked the,18
NA,Government to do was to allow an im-,18
NA,"partial tribunal to go into the whole facts,",18
NA,"and, i f satisfied that there had been no",18
NA,"fraud, but that his conduct had been per-",18
NA,"fectly straightforward, to order the return",18
NA,of the goods. I f the Court was not satisfied,18
NA,that Mr Goldring's conduct had been honest,19
NA,"and straightforward, he asked that reasons",19
NA,should be given for any dissatisfaction.,19
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I t is common,19
NA,robbery.,19
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , Mr Goldring,19
NA,took up what was a fair position for a busiin,19
NA,"ness man to assume, but tlie Customs",19
NA,"authorities said-""W e will not allow the",19
NA,courts to deal with this matter. We take,19
NA,the objection that they have,19
NA,"tion."" The result was that he could not",19
NA,proceed with his case. That happened each port.,19
NA,about tbe date of the meeting of Parlia-,19
NA,ment. I saw i n the newspapers an account,19
NA,"of the proceedings, and a report of the",19
NA,"cision of the Judge, and on the face of i t",19
NA,"the case seemed such ahard one that,",19
NA,although I did not at the time know Mr.,19
NA,"Goldring, I felt, ifc my duty, when speaking",19
NA,on the motion for the adoption of tlie,19
NA,"address in reply, to bring forward",19
NA,the whole matter for the consideration,19
NA,"of the Government, and to ask that",19
NA,"might be inquired into, so that any wrong",19
NA,which might have been done might be rejeweller,19
NA,"dressed as early as possible. Mr Goldring,",19
NA,seeing that I had brought the matter before,19
NA,"the House, wired to me to .ask if I would",19
NA,"grant him an interview, and I felt i",19
NA,duty to accede to his request. I think i t,19
NA,our duty as Members of Parliament to,19
NA,"listen to the grievances of those, no",19
NA,"what their position in life, who assert",19
NA,injustice has been done to them for,19
NA,they cannot obtain redress from the,19
NA,"ment or from the Law Courts, and,",19
NA,"think necessary, to bring their cases before",19
NA,Parliament. I thereupon looked through,19
NA,"all the papers i n the case, and i",19
NA,peared to be a very hard one. Mr Gold Mr.,19
NA,ring's action throughout shows that,19
NA,was not afraid to submit his case to fche,19
NA,light of day. Had he been afraid to do,19
NA,he would nofc have appealed to the,19
NA,Courts and to Parliament' for redress.,19
NA,"came to Melbourne at considerable expense,",19
NA,and while here interviewed the Customs,19
NA,"authorities, who, after a detention of his",19
NA,"goods for seven months, and having made",19
NA,'inquiries of his customers and competaken,19
NA,titors as to the correctness of his invoices-,19
NA,' thus practically branding him as a criminal,19
NA,"throughout Australia-wer e forced, on' the interfered with Mr Goldring's business.",19
NA,"6 th June, to admit that the valuation",19
NA,"he made on the 17 th November was correct,",19
NA,and gave him delivery of his goods without,19
NA,any extra bond or duty.,19
NA,4x,19
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , H a v e all his,19
NA,goods now been delivered to him ?,19
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,No . He then,19
NA,"went to Sydney, and endeavoured to obtain",19
NA,fche same terms there. He told the Cus-,19
NA,toms officials in Sydney what had been done,19
NA,"Melbourne, but they refused point-blank",19
NA,"to be. guided by that, and demanded an",19
NA,"extra bond of 25 per cent., and an extra",19
NA,"cash payment of 25 per cent., before the de-",19
NA,no jurisdiclivery of the goods.,19
Mr THOMSON , A different treatment i n,19
Mr BAMFORD ,Di d not the Customs,19
NA,authorities in Melbourne acquaint the Syd-,19
NA,deney officials with what had been done ?,19
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I f I were,19
NA,Minister for Trade and Customs I should,19
NA,be able to tell the honorable member all the,19
NA,"facts; but, as i t is, I cannot answer fchafc",19
NA,question. I broughtfchematter up i n tlie,19
NA,"House some weeks back, and I think that",19
NA,an inquiry should have been made by this,19
NA,i t time. Mr Goldring's business has been,19
NA,practically ruined. I happened to meet a,19
NA,"in the town of Penrith, i n which I",19
NA,reside- a Mr Tennant-wh o waited upon,19
NA,"me, and said- "" I notice that you brought",19
NA,Goldring's case before the Hoiise the other,19
NA,"t my day."" I said-""Yes ; what do you know",19
NA,"is about ifc I "" He said- "" I have been dealing",19
NA,"with Goldring for a number of years, and",19
NA,matter have always found him an honorable and,19
NA,that straightforward man. I gave him an order,19
NA,which as far back as July last for - a num-,19
NA,Governber of Boehm and Co.'s watches. These,19
NA,"i f we watches are i n port rfow, and have",19
NA,"ray name printed on their dials, but I can-",19
NA,not get delivery of them; though my cus-,19
NA,t aptomers are waiting. I have appealed to,19
NA,"Goldring, but he tells me that - i t",19
NA,he is impossible for him fco take any action,19
NA,"in tbe matter, because the Customs autho-",19
NA,"so, rities have seized all his goods, includ-",19
NA,"Law ing those indented to my order."" Mr.",19
NA,"He Tennant added that, although he had",19
NA,been buying Boehm and Co.'s watches for,19
NA,"a number of years, he could not neglect the",19
NA,"interests of his customers, andfchattherefore",19
NA,"he would be forced, i f some action were not",19
NA,"immediately, bo go elsewhere in future.",19
NA,Honorable members can see from that state-,19
NA,ment how seriously these proceedings have,19
NA,I,19
NA,which ask honorable members to place themselves,19
NA,in his position. He is an importer of,19
NA,"watches, with customers all over Australia.",19
NA,But if i n these days of keen competition he,19
NA,cannot supply his customers with what they,20
NA,"want, they will go elsewhere, and he will",20
NA,then lose their business. So serious has the,20
NA,"matter become, that I have been told that",20
NA,"Mr Goldring, finding that he could not get",20
NA,"redress, either at the hands of the Minister",20
NA,"or from the Law Courts, has asked Messrs.",20
NA,Boehm and Co. nofc to send out any more,20
NA,watches until the matter has been settled.,20
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,How,20
NA,tected by insurance in regard to the goods,20
NA,while they are in the possession of the Cus-,20
NA,toms 1 Has he fco take all risk of fire and,20
NA,damage 1,20
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I do not know,20
NA,what his position is in that respect. Prom,20
NA,"whatever aspect the case is viewed, i t is a",20
NA,"most serious one, and demands the most",20
NA,prompt and searching inquiry. I have been,20
NA,told that the firm of Boehm and Co. is one,20
NA,"of the largest in London, and I do nofc",20
NA,think ifc would be a breach of confidence if,20
NA,"I were to refer to a letter i n my possession,",20
NA,to show its reputation in the country,20
NA,whence most of these goods come. The,20
NA,letter to which I refer was sent by a mem-,20
NA,ber of the Swiss Government to Lord Lans-',20
NA,"downe, and i t shows thafc the firm is of very",20
NA,high standing. I am told further that this,20
NA,Government have received a communication,20
NA,"from the Imperial Government, asking that",20
NA,"fche whole matter may be inquired into, so",20
NA,thafc justice may be done. I f Goldring has,20
NA,"been guilty of fraud I , and every member",20
NA,"of the House, will support the Minister i n",20
NA,punishing him.,20
NA,Mr THOMSON.*-Bu t we cannot counten-,20
NA,ance the long drawn-out process which he,20
NA,has adopted.,20
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,No . I f fraud is,20
NA,alleged fche Government should have taken,20
NA,action long ago. They have had Mr Gold-,20
NA,"uing's papers, books, and invoices in their",20
NA,possession since the 17fch November. When,20
NA,"the Customs officers went to his office, he said",20
NA,"to his clerk- "" Give them everything they",20
NA,require. I do not want to handle the papers,20
NA,"myself, because I have nothing to conceal.",20
NA,"Let them go through my books, and do what",20
NA,"fchey like i n regard fco them.""",20
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN ,But,20
NA,"understand that the Customs authorities,",20
NA,"after taking possession of his books, refused",20
NA,to supply him with copies of their con-,20
NA,tents 1,20
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ," Mr Goldring,",20
NA,finding that he could not get his books re-,20
NA,"turned, applied for certified copies of their",20
NA,"contents, so that he could, if necessary,",20
NA,proceed i n the courts of law against any of,20
NA,his customers with whom he might have,20
NA,disputes in matters of account. Section,20
NA,215 of the Customs A c t provides that-,20
NA,The Collector may impound or retain any docu-,20
NA,ment presented in connexion with ajjy entry or,20
NA,"required to be produced under this Act, but fche",20
NA,person otherwise entitled to such document shall,20
NA,in lieu thereof be entitled'fcoa copy certified as,20
NA,"is he pro- correct by the Collector, and such certified copy",20
NA,shall be received in all courts as evidence and of,20
NA,equal validity with the original.,20
NA,Between November and May Mr Gold-,20
NA,ring was unable to get any copies at,20
NA,ail. He was then supplied with what,20
NA,purported to be copies of the original,20
NA,"invoices and papers, but fchey were not",20
NA,certified copies as provided for by the,20
NA,Act. A n y one looking at fche papers in this,20
NA,case would find i t difficult. to believe that,20
NA,we are living under British rule. I have,20
NA,heard of administrative acts perhaps worse,20
NA,"than this in Russia, but during the whole",20
NA,"course of my parliamentary career, extend-",20
NA,"ing over twenty years, I have never'",20
NA,hud to submit a more glaring case. I n,20
NA,"fact, unless a satisfactory explanation is",20
NA,"forthcoming, I do nofc think the matter",20
NA,should end here. I am told that there are,20
NA,other cases equally as bad as this. I have,20
NA,seen a letter from a prominent firm of solici-,20
NA,tors in Sydney expressing sympathy with,20
NA,"Mr Goldring, and telling him that they",20
NA,had been consulted regarding a case,20
NA,on all fours with his. Suppose Mr .,20
NA,Goldring had been a man who was,20
NA,unable to prosecute his claims in the,20
NA,"law courts, and also unable to come fco",20
NA,Melbourne in order to claim that justice,20
NA,"should be done. I t seems, according to the",20
NA,"information supplied to me, that either the",20
NA,Minister or his officers have perpetrated a,20
NA,gross injustice. I think i t will be found,20
NA,that the Minister himself ordered the stop-,20
NA,page of some of these goods; but the right,20
NA,honorable gentleman may have some ex-,20
NA,planation to offer upon that point. I under-,20
NA,stand that fche Minister himself has now,20
NA,"ordered the delivery of some of the goods, and",20
NA,has accepted the value placed upon them by,20
NA,are we to,20
NA,Mr Goldring eight months ago. This,20
NA,"shows he is satisfied, after having made",20
NA,"fche fullest inquiries, that Mr Goldring's",20
NA,"valuation was a correct one, and yet that",20
NA,unfortunate importer is unable to obtain,20
NA,"any reply or explanation from the Minister,",20
NA,or to get his books or papers to enable him,20
NA,to carry on his business. The Minister,20
NA,"should have fully investigated the matter,",21
NA,"and, if he considered that Mr Goldring had",21
NA,"been guilty of any fraud, should have pro-",21
NA,"ceeded against him, instead of preventing",21
NA,him from doing any business for a period of,21
NA,eight months. I have endeavoured to place,21
NA,the case before honorable members without,21
NA,any feeling. I f the facts as stated by Mr.,21
NA,"Goldring are wrong, all I ask is that the",21
NA,Minister shall give to honorable members,21
NA,the explanation which he has ref used to Mr.,21
NA,"Goldring, so that we may judge who is to",21
NA,blame. I f the Minister is satisfied that an,21
NA,"injustice has been done, let him order not",21
NA,"only the delivery of the goods, but also the",21
NA,restoration of Mr Goldring's books and,21
NA,papers.,21
Mr THOMSON ,Tha t cannot compensate,21
NA,him.,21
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , N o : but i,21
NA,will enable him to carry on his business.,21
NA,The question of compensation will have to,21
NA,"be considered afterwards, and, no doubt, a",21
NA,large amount will be required to recompense,21
NA,Mr Goldring for the loss of his business for,21
NA,over eight months.,21
Mr RONALD ,W e can give him a seat in,21
NA,the Senate.,21
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I f one of the,21
NA,honorable member's constituents had been,21
NA,"treated in the same way as Mr Goldring,",21
NA,he would be the very first to bring the case,21
NA,before the House. I make no distinction,21
NA,"between -the rich and the poor, and I think",21
NA,i t is our duty to submit for consideration,21
NA,any case which may appear to call for,21
NA,redress. Mr Goldring appears to have a,21
NA,substantial grievance against the Govern-,21
NA,"ment, and I demand-an d I believe Par-",21
NA,liament will demand-tha t the Government,21
NA,"should explain why, if in the wrong, Mr.",21
NA,Goldring had not been proceeded against,21
NA,"months ago, and i f in the right, why the",21
NA,Minister has not long since directed the,21
NA,"return of his goods, invoices and books.",21
NA,Before I sit down I may explain thafc I,21
NA,"received a letter from Mr Mitchell to-day,",21
NA,stating that yesterday morning he received,21
NA,a letter from the Attorney-General's Depart-,21
NA,ment appointing a nominal defendant.,21
Mr CROUCH ,I t is very late i n the day,21
NA,"for the honorable member to say that, after",21
NA,all the statements he has made.,21
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ," I think the viser,",21
NA,Attorney-General will do me the justice to,21
NA,say that I pointed out in my opening,21
NA,remarks that I had referred fchis matter to,21
NA,"three prominent barristers i n the House,",21
NA,4X 2,21
NA,"and that they had stated thafc, even sup-",21
NA,posing that the Attorney-General had con-,21
NA,sented to appoint himself as nominal de-,21
NA,"fendant, the case would not be sub judice,",21
NA,and that I should be justified i n bringing i t,21
NA,before the House.,21
Mr DEAKIN ,Ballarat-Attorney-Gene -,21
NA,ral) -Th e honorable and learned members,21
NA,"who advised the honorable member for Mac-,",21
NA,"quarie were technically right, but every other",21
NA,honorable member will see that i n a question,21
NA,"of this kind, technicalities count for nothing.",21
NA,The case is sub judice i n every sense of the,21
NA,"term, except the narrowest. The com-",21
NA,plainant has intimated his intention to-,21
NA,challenge the action of the Government in,21
NA,"the Law Courts, and has asked them to",21
NA,provide him with the means of doing so by,21
NA,appointing a nominal defendant. That,21
NA,t request has been complied with. As I told,21
NA,"the House on a previous occasion, I heard",21
NA,of this matter for the first time from the,21
NA,"honorable member for Macquarie, who men-",21
NA,tioned ifc in the House. On the same day I,21
NA,received an application for the appointment,21
NA,of a nominal defendant to represent the,21
NA,Commonwealth Government. M y minute,21
NA,"was drawn up and signed on that day, and",21
NA,submitted to the Executive Council on the,21
NA,16fch instant. A n intimation was sent to,21
NA,"Mr Goldring, I presume i n Sydney, the",21
NA,letter being posted on the 22nd.,21
Mr THOMSON ,Tha t is a week after ifc,21
NA,had been passed by the Executive Council.,21
Mr DEAKIN , S i x days after. The,21
NA,memorandum sent to me does not state why,21
NA,"the letter was delayed, but the fact that a",21
NA,"nominal defendant had ""been appointed was",21
NA,"conveyed to Mr Goldring, as he mentions",21
NA,"in his petition, by the statement to that",21
NA,effect made by me in the House. The letter,21
NA,conveying fche formal intimation thafc his,21
NA,request had been complied with was posted,21
NA,to Mr Goldring on the 22nd instant and,21
NA,on the next day he would receive i t .,21
Mr THOMSON ,H e would not receive i t,21
NA,until the 24th.,21
Mr DEAKIN ,"Howeve r thafc may be,",21
NA,this case is now sub judice once more. Mr.,21
NA,Goldring brought a case against fche Go-,21
NA,vernment of the Commonwealth in the,21
NA,"Courts of New South Wales. He, or his ad-",21
NA,is responsible for the form which that,21
NA,case assumed. When that case was disposed of,21
NA,"to hisdisad vantage, heasked authorityfrom us",21
NA,"fco commence another case, and he obtained",21
NA,that permissionpractically without a,21
NA,moment's delay-althoug h ifc appears that,22
NA,a fewdays elapsed before he received the,22
NA,letter conveying a formal intimation that a,22
NA,nominal defendant had been appointed.,22
NA,The effect offcheproceedings to-day is to,22
NA,put before the public an ex parte statement,22
NA,by Mr Goldring. I t may be true i n eveiy,22
NA,"particular, or i t may be false i n every",22
NA,particular- I am not sufficiently informed,22
NA,to know. But the public have his case put,22
NA,before them. I -take ifc that this gives Mr.,22
NA,Goldring one very improper advantage.,22
NA,There isa second and decidedly more im-,22
NA,proper advantage whieh he is seeking to,22
NA,"gain, 'namely, a statement by the Minister",22
NA,who acts as defendant for the Common-,22
NA,"wealth i n this action. He will, however,",22
NA,"fail in this, because I have advised my hon-",22
NA,orable colleague not to make any such,22
NA,statement i n regard to the case.,22
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Tha t is a nice way,22
NA,of evading the question.,22
Mr ISAACS ,I t is fche proper course to,22
NA,take.,22
Mr DEAKIN ," Mr Goldring is, with",22
NA,"our consent, suing the Commonwealth i n",22
NA,fche New South Wales Courts for the re-,22
NA,covery of damages.,22
Mr THOMSON ,H e has not,22
NA,writ.,22
Mr DEAKIN , W e have done all we,22
NA,"can to give him an opportunity of suing us,",22
NA,and we can do no more. I f he has not,22
NA,"issued a writ, that is not our fault. We",22
NA,have submitted fco fche State Court; bub,22
NA,now an endeavour is being made on behalf,22
NA,of Mr Goldring to obtain a statement,22
NA,which may assist him i n prosecuting his,22
NA,case against the Commonwealth. That,22
NA,most improper proceeding. A n y matter,22
NA,connected with fchis case which may be,22
NA,"serving of parliamentary scrutiny will,",22
NA,"hope, receive it, and no action on the part",22
NA,of the Government will for a moment,22
NA,vent that scrutiny when i t can be permitted,22
NA,without injury to the public interests.,22
NA,"present, however, Mr Goldring has chosen",22
NA,to put us at arm's length. He does not,22
NA,appear before this House with a statement,22
NA,that he does not propose fco seek his legal,22
NA,"remedy, and that he comes to this,",22
NA,"highest court of the Commonwealth, to",22
NA,peal for justice; but he comes before,22
NA,a time when he is applying to the State,22
NA,"Courts, and is seeking to hold us pecuniarily",22
NA,responsible for the detention of the,22
NA,and papers' which he claims.,22
NA,NA,22
NA,petition he was not sufficiently informed,22
NA,upon the matter.,22
Mr DEAKIN , H e had received a,22
NA,statement,22
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , A statement from,22
NA,the Department presided over by the,22
NA,AttorneyGeneral.,22
Mr DEAKIN , H e had received no,22
NA,statement from my Department. Having,22
NA,placed ourselves i n this position before the,22
NA,court; having come forward to defend any,22
NA,"action which he may institute against us,",22
NA,i t is clearly most improper to ask Ministers,22
NA,to make any statement which will assist a,22
NA,"litigant, who, if he has causeof complaint, will",22
NA,receive every justice. This suit is to be heard,22
NA,by a tribunal for which honorable members,22
NA,opposite entertain a decided preference- a,22
NA,State Supreme Court. Mr Goldring has,22
NA,presented a formal petition to the Governor-,22
NA,General i n Council informing him of his,22
NA,"desire to proceed against the Commonwealth,",22
NA,and asking thafc a nominal defendant,22
NA,be appointed. That nominal defendant,22
NA,was appointed without a day's delay. Mr .,22
NA,"Goldring has, therefore, obtained all",22
NA,"he has asked, and he has given us",22
NA,formal notice of his intention to sue us for,22
NA,issued a the recovery of damages.,22
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , D i d he not re-,22
NA,peatedly offer to sign any bond necessary to,22
NA,enable him to obtain delivery of his goods 1,22
Mr DEAKIN , I do nofc know. I have,22
NA,no knowledge of the particulars. I have nofc-,22
NA,"previously heard that statement made, and",22
NA,do not know whether ifc is correct. . This,22
NA,"case never came before me personally, ex-",22
NA,cept asfcoa formal intimation of fche pro-,22
NA,is a gress of the suit which Goldring was,22
NA,"instituting i n New South Wales, until",22
NA,defche request was made by him for the ap-,22
NA,I pointment of a nominal defendant.,22
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , B u t he is not-,22
NA,predealing with the honorable gentleman.,22
Mr DEAKIN ,Unfortunatel y he has,22
NA,A t chosen to deal with me.' He has not asked,22
NA,Parliament to t r y his cause - he has nofc,22
NA,submitted himself with confidence to our,22
NA,"decision. On the contrary, he has preferred",22
NA,that his cause shall be tried where he,22
NA,the can be heard as soon as the judicial,22
NA,aparrangements permit of that course being,22
NA,"us at adopted, and where he can obtain the",22
NA,compensation which he seeks. He asks for,22
NA,damages. I f he has been injured i n any,22
NA,books way he will obtain damages. He can,22
NA,either obtain the monetary damages which,22
NA,"he is asking from the court, or he can",23
NA,appeal to this House to grant him that,23
NA,relief to which he thinks he is entitled.,23
NA,He has chosen to take the former course.,23
NA,"We haye consented to the case being tried, in",23
NA,order that the court may determine whether,23
NA,he is entitled to damages on account of the,23
NA,"detention of his goods, books, and papers.",23
NA,There has been no delay upon our part in,23
NA,this matter. He is now called upon to,23
NA,"prove his case, and if he is enabled to com-",23
NA,pensation he will obtain i t .,23
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Th e Attorney-Gene-,23
NA,ral knows very well that he cannot obtain,23
NA,it.,23
Mr DEAKIN , He has informed me,23
NA,that he is petitioning for the return of his,23
NA,"books and papers, and for the recovery of",23
NA,"damages for their detention, as well as for",23
NA,injury to his business. No doubt he.has,23
NA,been advised that this is the proper course,23
NA,to take.,23
Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN ,J f there is,23
NA,nothing in the case why force him to law,23
NA,at all?,23
Mr DEAKIN , W e do not force him to,23
NA,law. Mr Goldring might have appeared,23
NA,"before Parliament, or he might have appealed",23
NA,to the Government.,23
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Afte r the,23
NA,eight months.,23
Mr DEAKIN , B u t I would point out,23
NA,to the honorable member that Mr Gold-,23
NA,ring has been prosecuting his case i n the,23
NA,New South Wales Courts for some time. I t,23
NA,was sub judice there tor several months.,23
NA,NA,23
NA,for Trade and Customs prosecute him if he,23
NA,has been guilty of fraud ?,23
Mr DEAKIN , I have not been in-,23
NA,"structed to prosecute him, and have no",23
NA,desire to prosecute any one. He has chosen,23
NA,a certain method of making his complaint,23
NA,for tbe detention of his goods.,23
An HONOURABLE MEMBER ,H e cannot do,23
NA,anything else.,23
Mr DEAKIN , B u t we can do some-,23
NA,thing else.,23
Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN ,The,23
NA,ney-General knows whether or not he has,23
NA,"been guilty of fraud. If he has not, why",23
NA,compel him to go to law t,23
Mr DEAKIN , I do not know whether,23
NA,he has been guilty of fraud. This case,23
NA,ginated i n Sydney.,23
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,"No , in Melbourne.",23
Mr DEAKIN ," I t occurred in Sydney,",23
NA,"and , has been dealt with by the Crown in",23
NA,Solicitor's office there. The first applica-,23
NA,tion received by me in Melbourne in con-,23
NA,nexion with the present case was that to,23
NA,"which I have previously referred, and that",23
NA,was dealt with at once. I repeat that Mr .,23
NA,"Goldring has chosen his own line. I f , after",23
NA,"his case has been judicially disposed of, honor-",23
NA,able members are not satisfied with the,23
NA,manner in which he has been treated-,23
NA,apart from the particular matter which is,23
NA,decided by the court-tha t will be the,23
NA,time to bring i t before Parliament. But i t,23
NA,is clearly not the time to bring i t forward,23
NA,"when Goldring, of his own choice, is ap-",23
NA,pealing to a court of law i n connexion,23
NA,with the very incidents which are now,23
NA,being challenged in this House. Honorable,23
NA,members represent not only the people,23
NA,"as a whole, but the Commonwealth,",23
NA,"which is being sued, and i t is not for us,",23
NA,"because we are Members of Parliament, to",23
NA,assist a litigant who is attacking the Com-,23
NA,"monwealth, by endeavouring to draw from",23
NA,the Minister for Trade and Customs a,23
NA,statement of his defence which is shortly,23
NA,to be put before the law courts That,23
NA,would be a. most unfair and improper posi-,23
NA,tion to take up. Mr Goldring has already,23
NA,gained tbe advantage of getting an ex parte,23
NA,lapse of statement of his case placed before the,23
NA,"public. Strictly speaking, that was not",23
NA,"within the bounds of propriety. But, irre-",23
NA,"spective of whether or not i t was proper, I",23
NA,hold that i t would be decidedly improper to,23
NA,ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to,23
NA,disclose upon the floor of this House infor-,23
NA,mation which might be used against the,23
NA,Commonwealth i n the suit that is now,23
NA,"pending. I have no hesitation, therefore,",23
NA,in Saying that any statement as to the,23
NA,details regarding the manner i n which,23
NA,Goldring has been treated by the Cus-,23
NA,toms Department in connexion with the,23
NA,detention of his books or goods would,23
NA,be highly objectionable afc the present time.,23
NA,I n court the plaintiff will be able to,23
NA,"elicit the defence of the Government, but",23
NA,this House is certainly not the place i n,23
NA,which to put forward fche defence relied,23
NA,Attor-,23
NA,upon i n the suit now pending.,23
Mr THOMSON ,North Sydney) -Th e,23
NA,attitude taken up by the Attorney-General,23
NA,and the Minister for Trade and Customs,23
NA,oriupon this matter is a most surprising one.,23
NA,The honorable member for Macquarie has,23
NA,raised no question as to the propriety of,23
NA,the detention by the Customs of the goods,23
NA,"question, or as to the legal liability of the",23
NA,Commonwealth for the action of the,24
NA,"Ministry, because that will depend upon",24
NA,whether the latter can show that the goods,24
NA,in question were not entered at their proper,24
NA,value. That is a matter into which this,24
NA,"House has no right to inquire, and the",24
NA,honorable member for Macquarie has not,24
NA,attempted to discuss i t . No prosecution,24
NA,"against Goldring has yet been instituted,",24
NA,but the Minister states that the mere ap-,24
NA,pointment of a defendant at his request-,24
NA,which only places the complainant i n the,24
NA,same position that we all occupy i n regard,24
NA,to every Other court in the Common-,24
NA,wealth,24
Mr LE GROOM ,Ha s Goldring not,24
NA,informed us that he intends to take action ?,24
Mr THOMSON ,I n what way has he,24
NA,informed us ? He has merely asked for,24
NA,the appointment of a nominal defendant.,24
NA,Why?,24
Mr LE GROOM ,Becaus e he intends,24
NA,to institute an action.,24
Mr THOMSON ,H e asks to be placed,24
NA,in the same position that is occupied by,24
NA,every other citizen i n regard to actions other,24
NA,than those against the Commonwealth.,24
NA,"When he has been placed i n that position, if",24
NA,"he sees fit, he can institute proceedings;",24
NA,but he need not do so.,24
Mr DEAKIN , H e has already given me,24
NA,formal notice of his intention to take,24
NA,action.,24
Mr THOMSON ,Whe n the Ministry,24
NA,"have no defence, we always witness fchis",24
NA,exhibition of soreness. The position is,24
NA,tbat no information has been asked from,24
NA,Ministers which will have any effect what-,24
NA,ever uponfchecase now pending.,24
Mr DEAKIN ,Tha t is not correct.,24
Mr THOMSON ,Th e Minister has not,24
NA,been asked if these goods were properly,24
NA,valued by Goldring. The honorable mem-,24
NA,ber for Macquarie has merely declared thafc,24
NA,in the administration of the Customs De-,24
NA,partment the state of affairs particularized,24
NA,by him should not be allowed to exist. Is,24
NA,a man to have his goods detained without,24
NA,"reason, and is every application to discover",24
NA,the cause of such action to elicit no reply,24
NA,for months ? The position i n connexion with,24
NA,Customs administration is becoming almost,24
NA,"intolerable-indeed , i t has been so for some",24
NA,time pasfc. The continuous delays which,24
NA,occur during which no answer is obtainable,24
NA,"from the Department, and the consequent",24
NA,"stoppage of trade, are far reaching i n",24
NA,their results. The imputations which are,24
NA,"directed against the characters of ""business",24
NA,people would be all very well i f they were,24
NA,"followed by action, but frequently fchey are",24
NA,not. The parties concerned can obtain no,24
NA,information. I could give instance after,24
NA,instance i n support of my statement. I,24
NA,know of one case in which a particular firm,24
NA,"said to the Department- "" Tell us the duty",24
NA,that has to be paid. We believe i t is so,24
NA,"much, but if i t is more we will pay ifc-onl y",24
NA,"decide."" Yet, i n that instance, six months",24
NA,were occupied i n obtaining a decision. I f,24
NA,the goods i n Goldring's case were not pro-,24
NA,"perly valued, why did not the Department",24
NA,institute proceedings against him ? But even,24
NA,"after this lapse of time, the Customs authori-",24
NA,ties have taken no such action. Surely i f,24
NA,"there is to be any liberty of the subject, i f",24
NA,he is to have any right to his own posses-,24
NA,"sions, we shall be neglecting the best tradi-",24
NA,tions of Parliamenfc i f we do not take a,24
NA,stand upon some of these cases.,24
Mr LE GROOM ,Wh y not pick out a,24
NA,case which is nofc likely to come before fche,24
NA,courts ?,24
Mr THOMSON ,Ma y I point out that,24
NA,this matter was brought up before any ques-,24
NA,tion was raised as to the appointment of,24
NA,a nominal defendant.,24
Mr LE GROOM ,No t to-day.,24
Mr THOMSON ,Wher e was the reply?,24
NA,I f I had occupied the office of Minister for,24
NA,Trade and Customs I should have considered,24
NA,ifc a reflection upon me had I not taken the,24
NA,first opportunity of placing a f u l l reply be-,24
NA,fore Parliament. What advantage would,24
NA,such a reply confer upon the plaintiff in the,24
NA,present case ? I t would merely be an ex-,24
NA,planation of why these delays occur-nof c,24
NA,as to whether Mr Goldring had been guilty of,24
NA,"any false dealing, but whether a reasonable",24
NA,and proper method of conducting the busi-,24
NA,"ness of the Department had been adopted,",24
NA,"so thafc he could get some answer, and not",24
NA,"be forced into court to ask for his goods, or",24
NA,for some reason for their detention.,24
Mr DEAKIN ,Tha t is the. very thing,24
NA,upon which Mr Goldring is suing.,24
Mr THOMSON ,"No ; he is, according",24
NA,"to the Attorney-General's own statement,",24
NA,suing for compensation.,24
Mr DEAKIN ,Fo r those very delays.,24
Mr THOMSON ,Instea d of telling,24
NA,"Mr Goldring why the goods were detained,",24
NA,a defence was entered on behalf of the,24
NA,Customs authorities denying jurisdiction.,24
NA,This is a most extraordinary proceeding.,24
NA,"We have two Ministers concerned, and the;",24
NA,one who knows nothing about the subject is,25
NA,"put up to give us information, while the other",25
NA,"sits alongside absolutely still, although",25
NA,he is the one who ought to know all,25
NA,about i t . But there is no information,25
NA,that the Minister for Trade and Customs,25
NA,could give which would in any way assist,25
NA,"the plaintiff if we have correct information,",25
NA,and i f the Minister made a clear statement,25
NA,"of the case, apart altogether from the ques-",25
NA,"tion of fraud, and put us in possession of",25
NA,the facts as to the procedure of the Depart-,25
NA,ment. Is i t not most' extraordinary that,25
NA,the Customs authorities are so frightened,25
NA,"about their action that, while they take",25
NA,every information from the man himself-,25
NA,"while they seize his books, his documents,",25
NA,and goods-the y will not open their mouths,25
NA,to say a word about the strength or weak-,25
NA,ness of their own procedure 1 That this,25
NA,question has been raised in Parliament is,25
NA,"nofc the fault of the party concerned, who",25
NA,took every means thafc were open to him,25
NA,of otherwise obtaining satisfaction. Why,25
NA,did the appointment of a nominal defendant,25
NA,nofc take place months ago ?,25
Mr DEAKIN , Because it was,25
NA,asked.,25
Mr THOMSON ,Di d not Mr Goldring,25
NA,months ago ask for the clearance of the goods,25
NA,"on any condition, or, if they could not be",25
NA,"cleared,fcobe informed as to what means he",25
NA,was to take to get possession of them ?,25
NA,Could fche Minister not have said fchafc he,25
NA,was going to detain the goods for what he,25
NA,"thought good cause, but that if Mr Goldring",25
NA,thought i t necessary fco take action a no-,25
NA,minal defendant would be appointed 1 But,25
NA,"there was nofc a word said, and Mr Goldring",25
NA,was left perfectly helpless. Would any,25
NA,business man remain in such a position,25
NA,if he saw any way out of i t 1 He could,25
NA,"nofc do business; indeed, I saw from",25
NA,one of Mr Goldring's letters' that i f i t,25
NA,had not been for the fact that his firm,25
NA,"at home supported him in his attitude,",25
NA,he would practically have had to cease,25
NA,operations. Mr Goldring took every,25
NA,"possible means of relief, but he received no",25
NA,help from the Customs authorities. I f any,25
NA,"question before us were sub judice, or",25
NA,"likely to become so, I would be the",25
NA,"last to discuss i t ; but, apart from the",25
NA,"questions which may go into court, there",25
NA,is enough in the treatment of this,25
NA,man by the Department to demand con-,25
NA,demnation from the members of the House.,25
NA,The position is so serious that unless the I,25
NA,statements made by Mr Goldring can be,25
NA,refuted-an d the Government have had,25
NA,every opportunity of refutation in the weeks,25
NA,"which have elapsed-somebod y ought to go,",25
NA,either some officer of the Customs who. is,25
NA,"responsible, or the Minister for Trade and",25
NA,Customs himself.,25
Mr CONROY ,Th e Minister is responsible,25
NA,for the acts of every officer.,25
Mr THOMSON ,Th e Minister is re-,25
NA,"sponsible in a certain sense, but if action",25
NA,has been taken without his knowledge ot,25
NA,"instruction, and is utterly out of reason,",25
NA,then i t may be somebody else who ought to,25
NA,go. I am very sorry thafc i t has beea,25
NA,necessary to bring fchis matter under the,25
NA,notice of honorable members. But; one of,25
NA,"the principal functions of Parliament, and one",25
NA,which in the older Parliaments was strongly,25
NA,"fought for, was the redress of grie vances and",25
NA,"especially the right to protect a uan's life,",25
NA,"liberty, and possessions. The action of the",25
NA,"Customs authorities, so far as the facts have",25
NA,"been laid before us, has been tyrannical,",25
NA,and opportunities for denial were afforded,25
NA,long before fche sub judice question arose,25
NA,nofc to prevent an explanation. I know of,25
NA,other cases in which fche action taken,25
NA,by fche authorities has been both im-,25
NA,"proper and tyrannical, and such action",25
NA,as would not be approved by Parliament.,25
NA,I cannot; say whether the Minister for Trade,25
NA,"and Customs knows of all tliose cases, but",25
NA,"there is sufficient i n this case alone, out-",25
NA,side the questions which may come before,25
NA,"the court, to justify an expression of opinion",25
NA,from this House. I f the goods of Mr Gold-,25
NA,"ring were nofc properly entered, fche Customs",25
NA,authorities had a case for prosecution,25
NA,which should have been entered upon,25
NA,long ago. Why should the Customs au-,25
NA,thorities have detained these goods unless,25
NA,they were prepared to defend their action 1,25
NA,"That, however, is the question which",25
NA,will come before the court; what; is,25
NA,before us is the arbitrary action offcheCus-,25
NA,toms authorities-th e absolute carelessness,25
NA,"they showed as to fchis man's interests,",25
NA,when they would not even reply to repeated,25
NA,letters and applications. The Customs au-,25
NA,"thorities pay not the leasfc attention, although",25
NA,"a man's whole interests may be involved, and",25
NA,finally fchey do what could have been done,25
NA,"afc first, namely, appoint a nominal defen-",25
NA,"dant, so that the person who feels aggrieved",25
NA,"may go into court. That, however, was not",25
NA,done until after eight or nine months of,25
NA,delay.,25
Mr ISAACS ,Surel y Mr Goldring knew,26
NA,lie could go into the court i f he desired to,26
NA,do so?,26
Mr THOMSON ,The n why was a no-,26
NA,minal defendant not appointed when Mr.,26
NA,Goldring took action ?,26
Mr ISAACS , I understand that a nominal,26
NA,defendant-was appointed the moment Mr.,26
NA,Goldring asked that i t should he done.,26
Mr THOMSON ,Bu t why was i t not,26
NA,done when Mr Goldring took action .in,26
NA,Sydney?,26
Mr DEAKIN , Mr Goldring chose to,26
NA,"bring his action i n another form, and did",26
NA,not ask for a nominal defendant.,26
Mr THOMSON , Mr Goldring did not,26
NA,"take action for damages or compensation,",26
NA,but only in order that his goods should be,26
NA,"given up, or reasons shown for their deten-",26
NA,"tion. Mr Goldring asked for his books, or",26
NA,certified copies of them ; and i f the honor-,26
NA,able and learned member for Indi had been,26
NA,in the House during the last hour,26
Mr ISAACS , I have heard i t a l l ; and,26
NA,I am very sorry to hear i t .,26
Mr DEAKIN ,"Hear , hear !",26
Mr THOMSON , I should think that,26
NA,the honorable and learned member for I n d i,26
NA,is very sorry ; and the Attorney-General's,26
NA,""" hear, hear "" is very appropriate. There",26
NA,is every reason for sorrow when a citizen of,26
NA,the Commonwealth can be dealt with as Mr.,26
NA,"Goldring was dealt with, apart altogether",26
NA,"from the question of guilt, with which we",26
NA,are not concerned now.,26
Mr ISAACS , I did not use the words i n,26
NA,the'sense which the honorable member at-,26
NA,tributes to me.,26
Mr THOMSON , I am putting my,26
NA,meaning on the words. Instead of comply-,26
NA,"ing with Mr Goldring's reasonable request,",26
NA,the Government employed fche leading bar-,26
NA,rister of New South Wales to enter a plea,26
NA,of no jurisdiction.,26
Mr DEAKIN ,Tha t barrister has a gene-,26
NA,ral retainer fromfcheGovernment.,26
Mr THOMSON ,Wha t is the use of,26
NA,quibbling ? The Government employed this,26
NA,"barrister to enter a plea of no jurisdiction,",26
NA,although Mr Goldring had only made fche,26
NA,reasonable request which I have indicated.,26
NA,"This is a most astounding state of affairs,",26
NA,apart altogether from the question of guilt,26
NA,which will have to be settled by the court.,26
NA,The Government i n this matter have shown,26
NA,"utter callousness, and have entered an",26
NA,evasive plea in the New South Wales not,26
NA,court; and if all citizens are to be treated in the Bill.,26
NA,"in this way, we had better not cast slurs",26
NA,which are often cast on arbitrary powers,26
NA,"such as Russia, but admit that we have",26
NA,come down to the same level.,26
Mr TUDOR ,Yarra) -I t is not my in-,26
NA,tention to deal with the case of Mr Gold-,26
NA,"ring, but to bring under the notice of the",26
NA,Prime Minister a matter which has been,26
NA,mentioned in this House many times pre-,26
NA,"viously, and to ask what are the intentions",26
NA,of the Government in connexion with i t .,26
NA,"On referring to Hansa/rd of the 5th June,",26
NA,"1901, I see that the honorable and learned",26
NA,member for Bendigo asked the Minister,26
NA,representing: the Postmaster-General when,26
NA,tbe Victorian officers who were transferred,26
NA,were going to receive the salaries to which,26
NA,fchey were entitled under section 19 of the,26
NA,Victorian Public Service Act. To that,26
NA,question fche honorable member for Tas-,26
NA,"mania, Sir Philip Fysh, replied that the",26
NA,matter of determining the salaries to which,26
NA,bhe officers were entitled under this par-,26
NA,ticular section was referred to the Public,26
NA,Service Board of Victoria ; that i t was,26
NA,understood fchafc the board was dealing,26
NA,with the question ; and thafc as soon,26
NA,as a decision was arrived at the salaries,26
NA,would be paid. Over two years have,26
NA,"elapsed since that question was asked,",26
NA,and the matter has since been referred to,26
NA,many times by the honorable and learned,26
NA,"member for Bendigo, and the honorable",26
NA,"member for Bourke, and myself. The Vic-",26
NA,torian Public Service Board asked for the,26
NA,loan of a Federal officer to visit fche several,26
NA,"States, i n order to inquire as to the salaries",26
NA,paid to officers occupying corresponding,26
NA,"positions, and the report of thafc officer was",26
NA,presented to fche Victorian Government in,26
NA,"December, 1901. The honorable member",26
NA,for Bourke and myself have asked questions,26
NA,"in reference to this report, but i t was evi-",26
NA,dently so favorable to the men that i t has,26
NA,never been presented to this House. I,26
NA,"have seen the report, and, so far as I can",26
NA,"understand it, and I have gone through",26
NA,"ifc carefully, I consider i t is favorable to",26
NA,the claims of the men. On the 13th,26
NA,February last year I raised the question in,26
NA,"the House, and the Treasurer, i n speaking",26
NA,"of the Victorian Public Service Act, and of",26
NA,"this particular section, is reported on pago",26
NA,9996 to have said-,26
NA,I would have preferred that that provision had,26
NA,"been inserted, but the House was practically",26
NA,unanimous in the vie* thafc it should find a place,26
NA,"Then, referring to the officer who made the",27
NA,"report, the Treasurer said-",27
NA,The officer whose services were requisitioned,27
NA,"hud been secretary o; the Reclassification Board,",27
NA,and had a very full knowledge of all the difficulties,27
NA,of the position. Naturally he gained much in-,27
NA,formation on these debatable points while acting,27
NA,as secretary to the Reclassification Board.,27
NA,I t has been said that the Victorian Parlia-,27
NA,ment was guilty of sharp practice in passing,27
NA,"the measure to which I have alluded, in-",27
NA,stead of leaving i t to the Federal Govern-,27
NA,ment to deal with the officers transferred,27
NA,from the Victorian service as they thought,27
NA,fit. I t is not my intention to debate that,27
NA,matter now. I t is sufficient for me that,27
NA,"the Act was passed, and, thafc being so, the",27
NA,Victorian Government should have seen,27
NA,thafc the law was carried out while the men,27
NA,were under their authority. The Treasurer,27
NA,is reported on page 9998fcohave stated- -,27
NA,Iu New South Wales a reclassification took,27
NA,"place just before the transfer of the Departments,",27
NA,by virtue of their Act.,27
NA,"I have observed that, under the regulations",27
NA,governing the New South Wales public ser-,27
NA,"vice, practically the whole of the transferred",27
NA,officers obtained increments aboutfchafctime.,27
NA,Officers who have been transferred from the,27
NA,Victorian service have been waiting for,27
NA,what they consider the recognition of their,27
NA,"just rights, and what I and other honorable",27
NA,members ask is that the Government should,27
NA,say whether they intend to give effect to,27
NA,the decision of the Full Court of Victoria.,27
NA,The honorable member for Bourke and the,27
NA,honorable member for Melbourne Ports both,27
NA,concur in the views which I am now ex-,27
NA,"pressing, though they have waived their",27
NA,right to speak on fche question so as not fco,27
NA,"unduly detain the House. The men, find-",27
NA,ing that they could nofc obtain from the Vic-,27
NA,torian Government what they were entitled,27
NA,"to under fche Act, wrote to the Prime",27
NA,"Minister and to the Premier of Victoria,",27
NA,stating that they were willing to take the,27
NA,case of any officer to the Supreme Court. A,27
NA,case in the Supreme Court went against,27
NA,"the men, but the Full Court has on two",27
NA,occasions given a verdict in their favour.,27
NA,They are now anxious to know what their,27
NA,"position is, and what action fche Federal",27
NA,Government intend to take. I admit that,27
NA,I do nob take very much notice of whafc the,27
NA,"newspapers say, but ifc is quite possible that",27
NA,"they may tell the truth sometimes, and i t is",27
NA,very likely that fchey were telling the truth,27
NA,"when, in October last, they published the",27
NA,statement that the Victorian Premier had,27
NA,"waited upon the Attorney-General, who was",27
NA,"then acting for the Prime Minister, and",27
NA,asked him hot to give effect to the Ac t i n,27
NA,"question, because to do so would involve",27
NA,"Victoria in a certain loss. To my mind,",27
NA,thafc is not the question with which we have,27
NA,to deal. We have not to considerfcheneeds,27
NA,"of any particular State in this connexion,",27
NA,but to ascertain what are the provisions of,27
NA,the law. I am surprised thafc a man of the,27
NA,legal knowledge and repute of the Premier,27
NA,of Victoria should have asked the Govern-,27
NA,ment to set aside an Act of the Parliament,27
NA,"of this State. I t is said, however, that he",27
NA,advised the 'repudiation of the Act while,27
NA,the case was pending in the law courts.,27
Mr HUME COOK ,Was not he himself a,27
NA,party to fche passing of the measure %,27
Mr TUDOR ,Yes . The Treasurer has,27
NA,informed us that the Victorian Parliament,27
NA,was practically unanimous i n supporting,27
NA,"the measure, and I cannot learn from fche",27
NA,Homsayrd reports thafc the Victorian Premier,27
NA,offered any objection to ifc. Many of fche,27
NA,States increased their expenditure prior to,27
NA,"federation, because they overlooked the",27
NA,fact thafc during tlie bookkeeping period,27
NA,the increase would have to be borne by,27
NA,themselves; but they are bound now to,27
NA,stand by whafc they did then. The men do,27
NA,"not make threats, but they want to know",27
NA,"whafc are fche intentions of fche Government,",27
NA,"and they are quite willing, i f the Govern-",27
NA,ment say that they will not give effect; to the,27
NA,"Act, to take their case into tlie law courts.",27
NA,We have heard a great deal this afternoon,27
NA,"about the grievances of importers, but i f",27
NA,fche Full Court of Victoria had given a,27
NA,decision in favour of as many importers as,27
NA,there are' officers affected by the Act to,27
NA,"which I refer, and the Government refused",27
NA,"to give effect to it, we should have heard",27
NA,enough row in this Chamber fco stir any,27
NA,Ministry. .,27
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Does the honorable,27
NA,member think it fair to set one class,27
NA,against another in that way 1 Is fchafc the,27
NA,way to obtain justice 1,27
Mr TUDOR , I am not anxious to set,27
NA,one class against another; I only wish to,27
NA,point out thafc these men have obtained a ver-,27
NA,dict in their favour from the Full Court of,27
NA,"Victoria, and that the Victorian Government",27
NA,"has, from the first, been reluctant fco give",27
NA,effect to it. They are anxious to know now,27
NA,how their claims will be treated by the,27
NA,Commonwealth Government. I do nofc,27
NA,"know how many men are affected, but I",27
NA,trust that justice will not be denied to,28
NA,them. I do not intend to go into the,28
NA,"matter any further now, but I hope that",28
NA,the Prime Minister will give ns the assurupon notice :-,28
NA,ance that he intends to carry the provisions,28
NA,of the A c t into effect.,28
Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN ,Meltion,28
NA,bourne) - I listened very carefully to the,28
NA,reading of the petition presented by the,28
NA,honorable member for Macquarie on behalf,28
NA,"> of Mr Goldring, and to the honorable memthe",28
NA,"ber's remarks upon the case, but I kept my",28
NA,mind free in the hope that the Minister,28
NA,Trade and Customs would make some,28
NA,planation on the subject. The reason,28
NA,why no answer is forthcoming' from the .,28
NA,"Minister is, I think, a very poor one. When",28
NA,"I , on a former occasion, alluded to some",28
NA,"prosecutions, the Minister not only gave a shown",28
NA,"f u l l explanation of the case, but made",28
NA,most furious attack upon those who were dehenge,28
NA,fendants at the time. That case was conditions.,28
NA,"sub judice, but I understand that i",28
NA,this case all that has happened is that,28
NA,an application has been made for the,28
NA,appointment of a nominal defendant,28
NA,"represent the Crown, and that the request",28
NA,"has been granted, but that there has been",28
NA,no intimation of any intention on the part,28
NA,of the plaintiff to proceed with his prosecuof,28
NA,"tion. I want to be fair, and though I",28
NA,sider that I have a grievance against the,28
NA,"Minister, I cannot believe that he has been",28
NA,"acquainted with what, has been going on",28
NA,this case.,28
Mr CONROY ,Does he say so t,28
Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN , I do,28
NA,not know what he says. A downright mess,28
NA,"has been made, and I do not think i t would",28
NA,have occurred i f the Minister had had,28
NA,matter in hand. But the position of affairs,28
NA,is so serious that I was not surprised to hear line.,28
NA,the honorable member for Macquarie say,28
NA,that we might as well be living in Siberia,28
NA,as under the present administration. I,28
NA,"hope, however, that the Government, i f",28
NA,muddle has been made by its Customs,28
NA,"officials, will not put Mr Goldring to",28
NA,"cost of going to law, but will at once",28
NA,acknowledge their mistake and put matters,28
NA,right. I am sure that in doing that they,28
NA,will have the hearty support of the House.,28
NA,"But i f they put him to serious cost,",28
NA,"unfairly, and do nofc give a f u ll and satistralia",28
NA,factory explanation of their action to,28
NA,"House, I feel that they will be deserving",28
NA,hearty censure.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,"last, I asked the Minister representing the",28
NA,Postmaster-General the following question,28
NA,"Whether, in view of the fact that the Tele-",28
NA,graph Department has authorized the construc-,28
NA,"of a telegraph line to Tarcoola, in South",28
NA,"Australia, without requiring any cash guarantee-",28
NA,"for construction and maintenance, the Postmaster-",28
NA,General will treat the State of Queensland simi-,28
NA,"larly, and place an amount on the Estimates for",28
NA,construction of a telegraph line from Jundah,28
NA,to Stonehenge (Queensland).,28
NA,for To that question I received the following-,28
NA,exanswer from the honorable member f o r,28
NA,"given Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh-",28
NA,I f i t can be shown that the same conditions,28
NA,exist in connexion with a telegraph line from,28
NA,"tea Jundah to Stonehenge, in Queensland, as were",28
NA,in connexion with the telegraph line to,28
NA,"Tarcoola, in South Australia, the Postmaster-",28
NA,a General will consider whetherfchelinefcoStone-,28
NA,should not be constructed under similar-,28
NA,n We have no gold-fields i n the Maranoa.,28
NA,"electorate, and therefore cannot give the",28
NA,same guarantee as has been given for the,28
NA,to Tarcoola line; but the district through,28
NA,which the Stonehenge line would go is per-,28
NA,"manently settled, and one offchebest pastoral",28
NA,areas i n the world. Ifc is within 40 miles,28
NA,"the telegraph line at Jundah, and within",28
NA,con100 miles of another telegraph line at,28
NA,"Longreach. Of course, like everything else",28
NA,"in South Australia, every little rush to a",28
NA,in mining field is magnified until i t becomes,28
NA,"fche biggest thing on the Continent, though",28
NA,subsequently i t falls to about fche smallest,28
NA,thing upon ifc.,28
NA,NA,28
NA,member fight his own case without trying,28
NA,the to damage that of some one else ? South,28
NA,Australia will have to pay for the Tarcoola,28
NA,NA,28
NA,willing to pay for the Stonehenge line ; but,28
NA,directly we ask for i t we are met with the,28
NA,a startling request for a cash guarantee of,28
NA,some thousands of pounds. Why should,28
NA,the the Government require such a guarantee,28
NA,when asked to put a telegraph line through a,28
NA,"permanently settled district in Queensland,",28
NA,while they are prepared to construct a tele-,28
NA,graph line in South Australia without any,28
NA,guarantee 1 I do nofc object to South Aus-,28
NA,"being provided with telegraph lines,",28
NA,the but I think fchafc Queensland should be,28
NA,of treated in the same way as the other States.,28
NA,"We are not able fco give a cash guarantee,",28
NA,but we can assure the Government of per-,29
NA,manent business. The departmental officers,29
NA,are i n possession of all the facts and figures,29
NA,"relating to the case, and yet they have the",29
NA,coolness to say that they will nofc construct,29
NA,the line unless ifc can be shown thatfchesame,29
NA,conditions exist as were shown to exist in,29
NA,connexion with the telegraph line to Tarcoola.,29
NA,A l l I ask is that the district which I repre-,29
NA,sent shall have the same fair and square,29
NA,deal as is being given to others. I should,29
NA,also likefchePrime Minister to give us some-,29
NA,definite information as to the present posi-,29
NA,tion i n respectfcofcheprinting of the electoral,29
NA,rolls for Queensland.,29
NA,NA,29
NA,wish to bring one or two small matters,29
NA,underfchenotice of Ministers. I was under,29
NA,"the impression, when we were passing the",29
NA,"Post and Telegraph Act, that i t contained",29
NA,a condition which prevented the farming,29
NA,"out of mail contracts. Only last week, how-",29
NA,"ever, a case was mentioned to me which ap-",29
NA,peared fco afford a glaring instance of sweat-,29
NA,ing. I shall give the names of the parties,29
NA,"concerned, and I trustfchafcthe Postmaster-",29
NA,General willmake the fullest inquiries. There,29
NA,"is a gentleman afc Ballarat, named Mr Vines,",29
NA,"trading under the name of Cobb and Co., who",29
NA,has taken a number of contracts for the,29
NA,carriage of mails. Some of fche smaller of,29
NA,these have been sublet fco different men for,29
NA,amounts very considerably below those,29
NA,which Mr Vines receives from the Govern-,29
NA,"ment. I n other -words, the sub-contractors",29
NA,"do all the work, and Mr Vines derives a",29
NA,fine income from the proceeds of the con-,29
NA,tracts. Por carrying the mails between,29
NA,Ballarat and Rokewood Mr Vines receives,29
NA,"£160 per annum, but the contract has been",29
NA,"Sublet to a man named Livingstone, who is""",29
NA,receiving only £ 7 2 per annum for doing,29
NA,the work. I am surefchafcwe do not wish,29
NA,cases of that kind to occur under the,29
NA,Postal Department. Ifc would appear either,29
NA,that we are paying £ 8 0 too much for the,29
NA,work or that the sub-contractor is perform-,29
NA,ing ifc for £ 8 0 less than he should re-,29
NA,ceive. I t has been stated since I notified,29
NA,my intention to bring this matter before,29
NA,the House that Mr Livingstone is an,29
NA,"employe^ of Mr Vines, but I have i t on",29
NA,the authority of a resident of the district,29
NA,that Mr Livingstone told him that he had,29
NA,taken fche contract from Mr Vines as stated.,29
NA,"Whatever fche facts may be, the subject is",29
NA,one which calls for the closest inquiry. I,29
NA,desire to direct attention to some of the,29
NA,circumstances under whichfcheconstruction,29
NA,of the Tarcoola telegraph line is being pro-,29
NA,ceeded with. The work is being carried on,29
NA,"by two gangs of permanent line repairers,",29
NA,one having been drawn from the Gladstone,29
NA,"district, and the other from the west coast",29
NA,of South Australia. These repairers have,29
NA,"been removed to undertake, not a small",29
NA,"work, but the erection of nearly 200 miles",29
NA,"of telegraph, which will probably occupy",29
NA,them for twelve months-althoug h I see,29
NA,that ifc is reported that fche work may be,29
NA,completed beforefcheend of the year. I f,29
NA,these gangs can be taken out of their,29
NA,proper districts and put on construction,29
NA,"work, there is something radically wrong",29
NA,somewhere. Either the men are not re-,29
NA,quired i n tbe districts to which fchey have,29
NA,"been attached, or fche work which fchey",29
NA,usually perform must suffer during their,29
NA,absence. Moreover we may safely conclude,29
NA,that instances of a similar kind might,29
NA,be found i n other parts of the Common-,29
NA,wealth. I do nofc know whether the course,29
NA,to which I have referred has been adopted,29
NA,"for economical reasons, but i f the repairing",29
NA,work i n the Gladstone and west coast dis-,29
NA,"tricts is to be allowed to fall into arrears,",29
NA,no real economy will be served by with-,29
NA,"drawing the men. I f , on the other hand,",29
NA,there is not sufficient work for the men to,29
NA,"do i n the ordinary course, the sooner the",29
NA,Minister takes action the better. I recently,29
NA,asked fche Treasurer-,29
NA,Why havefcheannual increments nofc been paid,29
NA,for the current year-fcoSouth Australian Federal,29
NA,officers who are entitled to tbe same by virtue of,29
NA,section 60 of the Public Service Act ?,29
NA,The Treasurer replied- -,29
NA,Mr MCLachlan explains that in certain cases,29
NA,the increments of South Australian officers have,29
NA,"not been paid, pending a decision of fche",29
NA,"Attorney-General. Iu these cases, iffcheincre-",29
NA,"ments were granted, the effect would befcoplace",29
NA,"the officer in a higher class, e.g -Increment s",29
NA,"have been allowed in cases where the salary, plus",29
NA,"the increment, would not exceed £184, £185 being-",29
NA,the minimum of the fourth class.,29
NA,The right honorable gentleman added thafc i t,29
NA,would not be wise to do anything until the,29
NA,"classification took place, because i t might",29
NA,have the effect of removing an officer from,29
NA,one class to another. I was under the im-,29
NA,pression that when the Commonwealth took,29
NA,"oyer fche various transferred services, the",29
NA,officers had preserved to them their existing,29
NA,"rights, and the Treasurer made no attempt",29
NA,to deny that the officers fco whom my,29
NA,question referred were entitled to their in-,29
NA,crements. The increases have been paid to,29
NA,"officers earning certain salaries,' but",30
NA,been withheld from those earning higher,30
NA,"incomes, the first reason assigned being",30
NA,the decision of the Attorney-General is,30
NA,"awaited, and the second, that i t is thought",30
NA,best not to do anything until the classificadition,30
NA,tion takes place. I do not know what is,30
NA,"the proper course to adopt, but I think that",30
NA,"the Attorney-General, who must have had",30
NA,"tlie matter i n his hands for some time,",30
NA,should give his decision with the utmost,30
NA,possible speed. It. is not fair to the oflicers,30
NA,that their increments should be withheld,30
NA,for month after month. It'would be better,30
NA,to receive an unfavorable reply than to be,30
NA,kept upon the tenterhooks of expectation,30
NA,for so long.,30
Mr HUME COOK ,Bourke) -On e of school.,30
NA,the matters which I had desired to bring fche,30
NA,under the notice of the House has already,30
NA,been referred to by the honorable member,30
NA,"for Yarra. As he stated, i t was agreed",30
NA,several honorable members who were inwhilst,30
NA,terested that he should state the case to,30
NA,"the House, and that others should not",30
NA,address themselves to i t . I should have,30
NA,strictly.adhered to that understanding,30
NA,cept that I wish to refer to one point which,30
NA,has been omitted. Under one section of,30
NA,"fche Victorian Public Service A c t No. 1721,",30
NA,oflicers who are receiving more than £ 1 5,30
NA,a year are entitled to certain increments,30
NA,ranging from £ 1 0 up to the large sum,30
NA,of £1S0 additional. Immediately the A,30
NA,was passed the Public Service Board set,30
NA,"to work, and I believe that in every case",30
NA,the officers who were receiving more than tion,30
NA,"£156 were granted their increments, wherewhereas",30
NA,as those who were being paid salaries beonly,30
NA,low that amount have had their increthe,30
NA,"ments withheld. Thus, the men who were",30
NA,better able to do without the additions,30
NA,"to their pay received tbem, whilst those who",30
NA,"were in receipt of small salaries, and who,",30
NA,in anticipation of some small addition to,30
NA,"incomes, had entered into various engagetherefore",30
NA,"ments, have not received any benefit from",30
NA,the promise contained in the State,30
NA,I also wish to refer to what may be volved,30
NA,regarded as a cognate matter. The Comor,30
NA,monwealth Public Service A c t provides,30
NA,the payment of a minimum wage of £ 1 1 0,30
NA,per annum under certain conditions. I,30
NA,think I am correct in saying that very,30
NA,few members understood that i t would be,30
NA,necessary for officers in the clerical division of £ 1 1 0 a year.,30
NA,to pass another examination before they,30
NA,would be entitled to receive that salary.,30
NA,"have What was intended was thafc, in whatever",30
NA,"division of the Service an officer might be,",30
NA,that he was to be paid fche minimum wage irre-,30
NA,spective of any examination or other test.,30
NA,The result of imposing the examination con-,30
NA,has been that officers who are occupy-,30
NA,ing fairly responsible positions have been,30
NA,placed over others who are receiving more,30
NA,pay than they are. I n the Postal Depart-,30
NA,"ment, the heads of the accountant's, money-",30
NA,"order, and despatch branches receive less",30
NA,"money than the officers under their charge. ,",30
NA,Some of these responsible officers have been,30
NA,"in the service for eighteen or twenty years,",30
NA,"and although thoroughly efficient, were not",30
NA,so ready to pass a purely technical examina-,30
NA,"tion, as others who had more recently left;",30
NA,"Therefore, we have presented fco us",30
NA,extraordinary spectacle I have described -,30
NA,I should like to add thafc fche ladies i n the,30
NA,"branches to which I have referred, were",30
NA,"by also placed under a disadvantage, i n that",30
NA,six subjects were prescribed for the,30
NA,"clerks, only one was set for the operators.",30
NA,Amongst the subjects set dpwn for the,30
NA,clerks was an examination upon the newly,30
NA,exestablished telegraph rates. T n this con-,30
NA,"nexion, I am informed that even the heads",30
NA,of the Department themselves entertained,30
NA,very grave doubts as to whafc rates were,30
NA,6 chargeable in certain cases under thafc Act.,30
NA,"Por instance, officers were constantly com-",30
NA,pelled to consultfcheheads of their Depart-,30
NA,ct ment to ascertain what amount should be,30
NA,charged upon' press messages. Yet these,30
NA,lady clerks were required to pass an examina-,30
NA,"in thafc subject in addition to fi ve others,",30
NA,the operators were requi red to pass in,30
NA,"one subject. These difficulties', added to",30
NA,fact that the ladies i n question had left,30
NA,"-school for many years, placed them in the",30
NA,position that I have indicated. I would,30
NA,further point out that they do nofc receive,30
NA,"any pension, nor do they come under the in-",30
NA,their surance clauses of the State Act. I t is,30
NA,of great importance thafc they,30
NA,should be paid at least as much as are those,30
NA,Act. whom they command. The amount i n,30
NA,"is a small one, representing only £ 2 5",30
NA,"£ 2 6 a year, but i t is of very great",30
NA,for moment to them. Ifc is also worthy of,30
NA,notice that all these lady clerks were recom-,30
NA,"mended by the Reclassification Board, which",30
NA,was appointed i n Victoria prior to the,30
NA,"accomplishment of Federation, for a salary",30
NA,That tribunal recom-,30
NA,mended that precisely the sum fixed by this,30
NA,Parliament as a minimum wage should,30
NA,be paid to them without the necessity,31
NA,of thejr having to pass any examina-,31
NA,"tion, but merely as a reward of the fitness",31
NA,which they had displayed in the discharge,31
NA,"of their duties. As a matter of fact,",31
NA,some of them are daily in charge of stamps,31
NA,and money representing a total value of,31
NA,between £600 and £700. For the dis-,31
NA,charge of their onerous duties they receive,31
NA,"only £ 8 4 annually. Further, some of them",31
NA,"have to snpply statistical information, to",31
NA,"keep a record of all the revenue received by,",31
NA,"the Telegraph Department, and i n various",31
NA,ways to do work which calls for tbe exer-,31
NA,cise of more than ordinary ability. I n,31
NA,"short, they are sub-officers, and as such",31
NA,their services ought to be recognised. . I,31
NA,submit these facts in order that the Govern-,31
NA,"ment may consider them, with a view to",31
NA,"overcoming the difficulty that has arisen,",31
NA,and doing that justice to these public,31
NA,servants to which every reasonable man,31
NA,will admit they are entitled. The only,31
NA,other matter to which I wish to refer has,31
NA,reference to tlie Defence Department. I,31
NA,am rather surprised to find that an extra-,31
NA,ordinary state of affairs obtains in con-,31
NA,nexion with thafc Department.' Notwith-,31
NA,standing that no Defence Act has yet been,31
NA,"passed by this House, we see by the Govern-",31
NA,"ment Gazette, and by unofficial press notices,",31
NA,"that the Minister, with the consent of the",31
NA,"Government, is daily issuing regulations",31
NA,with respect to the forces. I should have,31
NA,thought that until a Defence Act was passed,31
NA,i t would be absolutely idle to alter the regu-,31
NA,"lations which previously existed, because",31
NA,the adoption of such a course would render,31
NA,i t more difficult to deal with that measure,31
NA,when i t is presented to Parliament. Under,31
NA,the old regulations everything worked - very,31
NA,"smoothly, and I am of opinion that they",31
NA,would have been quite sufficient for all,31
NA,purposes until a Defence A c t is passed.,31
Mr CROUCH ,Th e new regulations,31
NA,necessary to cover past illegalities.,31
Sir JOHN FORREST ,No t at all.,31
Mr HUME COOK ,A t any rate I have,31
NA,heard that a great many of the new regula-,31
NA,tions have been framed with a view to cover-,31
NA,"ing up, if nofc illegalities, afc any rate blun-",31
NA,ders on the part of the Defence Depart-,31
NA,ment.,31
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Ther e is no trut h,31
NA,whatever in that statement.,31
Mr CROUCH ,I n some cases the new re-,31
NA,gulations were necessary.,31
Mr HUME COOK ,M y impression is,31
NA,thafc there is a good deal of truth in fche,31
NA,"statement, but I cannot speak with",31
NA,"authority, as I have nofc inquired into the",31
NA,"matter. I wish, however, to draw particu-",31
NA,lar attention to the fact thafc waste of time,31
NA,is involved i n making new regulations re-,31
NA,garding powers and privileges acquired,31
NA,under certain State Acts. I do not suppose,31
NA,that any one can foretell how far those re-,31
NA,gulations will prejudice the Defence Bill,31
NA,which we shall presently be called upon to,31
NA,consider. I should have thought thafc in,31
NA,the new Act certain provisions would be,31
NA,made for fche framing of fresh regula-,31
NA,"tions, and that those regulations would",31
NA,be issued under the authority of thafc,31
NA,Act. But until thafc authority has been,31
NA,"given, ifc is not wise to frame new",31
NA,regulations. Another matter connected,31
NA,with the Defence Department to which I,31
NA,wish to draw attention has reference to the,31
NA,General Officer Commanding the forces.,31
NA,He appears to think i t incumbent upon him,31
NA,to make statements i n public which I think,31
NA,ought to be made only to the Minister. Some,31
NA,"of these statements"" are of' a confidential",31
NA,"nature, and others refer to matters of",31
NA,"policy in regard to which he, as a public",31
NA,"officer of the Commonwealth, ought not to",31
NA,express an opinion. I n a speech which he,31
NA,made at Adelaide a few days ago he referred,31
NA,to the transcontinental railway. The ques-,31
NA,tion of whether or not that railway should,31
NA,be constructed is one of public policy. I f i t,31
NA,be constructed i t will nofc necessarily be a,31
NA,line for defence purposes only. Ifc will be a,31
NA,"commercial undertaking as well, and the",31
NA,wisdom or otherwise of constructing i t is not,31
NA,a matter upon which an officer of the Com-,31
NA,monwealth should make any public remark.,31
NA,This Parliament has to determine matters,31
NA,"of policy, and public statements by servants",31
NA,"of the Commonwealth, which are prejudicial",31
NA,"to the Government policy, are, in my view,",31
NA,are,31
NA,injudicious and unwise. I also notice,31
NA,fcbat General Hutton refers to the poor,31
NA,equipment of the forces and to the lack of,31
NA,ammunition. I do not think that public,31
NA,comments should be made by him concern-,31
NA,ing these matters. I f there be any lack of,31
NA,"ammunition, or equipment; i f the defence",31
NA,"forces are short of supplies, and if, as a re-",31
NA,"sult, we should be unable to meet an attack,",31
NA,those facts ought to be made known to the,31
NA,Minister in charge of the Department.,31
NA,"Therefore, without desiring to say anything",31
NA,"offensive regarding this particular officer,",31
NA,who is apparently doing his best according,32
NA,"to his lights- I say according to his lights,",32
NA,because I disagree with most of what he is,32
NA,doing- I hold that no public statement,32
NA,should be made by him upon matters of,32
NA,public policy.,32
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,Lor d Charles Beresby,32
NA,ford made various statements which rethe,32
NA,sulted in improvements i n the Imperial,32
NA,navy.,32
Mr HUME COOK , I do Dot know,32
NA,"whafc is the practice in the United Kingdom,",32
NA,"but i n regard to matters of public policy,",32
NA,the citizens of Australia are exceedingly,32
NA,jealous of the utterances of public servants,32
NA,either of the States or of the Commonwealth.,32
NA,A l l such subjects should be dealt with by,32
NA,"the responsible Minister, and I make this",32
NA,protest to emphasize what I consider to,32
NA,the public view of the matter.,32
Mr ISAACS ,Indi) -Ther e are only two,32
NA,matters to which I desire very briefly,32
NA,refer. The first is that which was introSo,32
NA,duced by the honorable member for Machas,32
NA,quarie. I am quite sure that he would not,32
NA,wittingly offend against the canons of good,32
NA,taste by introducing a* subject that would,32
NA,have been better left untouched. I refer,32
NA,to fchis matter only for the purpose of showtion,32
NA,ing that we ought fco respect the silence,32
NA,the Minister for Trade and Customs. I allowed,32
NA,"believe, under the circumstances, that the",32
NA,right honorable gentleman is following,32
NA,proper course by declining to utter a single,32
NA,word.,32
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,H e was not silent,32
NA,when the honorable member for Melbourne,32
NA,attacked his administration regarding the,32
NA,admission of certain consignments of tea.,32
Mr ISAACS , I do not remember all six weeks.,32
NA,the circumstances connected with thafc,32
NA,matter.,32
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,If c suited the,32
NA,"honorable gentleman to reply then, and to",32
NA,appeal to the feelings of honorable members.,32
Mr ISAACS , I repeat fchafc,32
NA,case the Minister is adopting the proper,32
NA,course by preserving absolute silence. I,32
NA,am sure that we all credit him with think-,32
NA,ing that he is right.,32
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Does he think that,32
NA,he is right 1,32
Mr ISAACS , I am sure fchafc every,32
NA,honorable member believes that the Minisa,32
NA,ter does think so. I f he were to rise,32
NA,"attempt to justify himself, he would clearly",32
NA,be doing what might be prejudicial to,32
NA,individual whose cause the honorable mem-,32
NA,ber for Macquarie has urged to-day. By,32
NA,"taking that course, he would also expose the",32
NA,"position of tlie Department, and, under all",32
NA,"the circumstances, I think thafc the advice",32
NA,"given by the Attorney-General, and followed",32
NA,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, is",32
NA,only one consistent with his position.,32
Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN , I f he wil l,32
NA,put things right now we will forgive him.,32
Mr ISAACS ,Th e other matter to which,32
NA,I Wish to address myself has reference to,32
NA,"the public servants, whose case was so ably",32
NA,put by the honorable member for Yarra. I,32
NA,have only a suggestion to make in reference,32
NA,"to that matter, but before doing so I wish",32
NA,to put myself right before the House. I t is,32
NA,well known that the other day I acted as,32
NA,be one of the counsel engaged in tw» cases,32
NA,which were contested i n the Supreme Court,32
NA,"of Victoria. I hope, therefore, that honor-",32
NA,to able members will not misunderstand me.,32
NA,"far as Victoria is concerned, the matter",32
NA,"been determined, but ifc is impossible at",32
NA,the present moment to say that there is a,32
NA,final determination for all purposes. I be-,32
NA,lieve that when the law is finally deter-,32
NA,mined the Government will have no hesita-,32
NA,"i n acting on. the law, and I wish to",32
NA,of make the suggestion that the matter be,32
NA,"to rest, perhaps i t may be necessary",32
NA,"for a few days only, i n order that we may",32
NA,the see whether some more definite position,32
NA,may nofc be attained. I t may facilitate the,32
NA,final determination of the law i f we are able,32
NA,at some no distant date to say that the,32
NA,matter has reached a conclusion.,32
Mr MCDONALD , A man may be ruined,32
NA,if the matter be left for another month or,32
Mr ISAACS , I only make a sugges-,32
NA,t i o n ; I have explained my position to fche,32
NA,"right House, and I am unable to say more. I",32
NA,"think i t might save the time of the House,",32
NA,and facilitatefchesettlement of the matter if,32
NA,i n this my suggestion were followed.,32
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) - I contend,32
NA,that the case which has been put before us,32
NA,cannot be regarded as sub judice. We have,32
NA,"an admission from the Attorney-General,",32
NA,"thafc i t may not be technically sub judice,",32
NA,but he appealed to laymen to say,32
NA,that i t was practically sub judice. What,32
NA,contrast thafc is to the action taken,32
NA,and on behalf of the Government in Sydney !,32
NA,On thab occasion who so technical as,32
NA,the the Attorney - General when he raised,32
NA,the plea of no jurisdiction? When there,33
NA,"was a technical defence, the Attorneyshown",33
NA,"General made use of i t ; but now, when",33
NA,"there is no technical defence, he takes",33
NA,"another line, and appeals to laymen, people",33
NA,"whose common sense will guide them, to them.",33
NA,to say that the case is really sub judice.,33
NA,The plaintiff i n this case has merely,33
NA,claimed what is the right of every other,33
NA,citizen. He has claimed to know the name,33
NA,and station of the person against whom,33
NA,"has a grievance, in order that he may, after",33
NA,"thinking the matter over, institute proceedThe",33
NA,ings if he considers such a step necessary.,33
NA,But I am sorry to say that this is one of,33
NA,those cases i n which the plaintiff has no,33
NA,"remedy, and when the Attorney-General",33
NA,said that the plaintiff had a remedy,33
NA,spoke without a knowledge of the present,33
NA,law. I do not blame the Attorney-General Minister.,33
NA,"for that, because none of us can be expected",33
NA,to know the law unless we look up Acts,33
NA,and authorities. Great as I thought the of the plaintiff?,33
NA,"enormities of the Ministry were, I did not",33
NA,anticipate that we should have a reign,33
NA,"terror introduced, or that there would be",33
NA,denial of justice i f there happened to,33
NA,no remedy at law. I was under fche imthis,33
NA,"pressionfchafcMinisters, i n ordinary circumthe",33
NA,"stances, would say to a person",33
NA,"was aggrieved, "" I f , owing to various causes,",33
NA,we have not been able tp initiate a system,33
NA,of law which enables justice,33
NA,"the courts, we, as men, will afc leasfc see that",33
NA,"justice is done as far as possible."" I thought",33
NA,"fchafc, under fche circumstances, the",33
NA,ment would be specially careful; but,33
NA,has not proved to be the case. When fche,33
NA,Claims Against the Commonwealth Bill was,33
NA,under consideration on the 3rd October I,33
NA,"last, I pointed out that under its provisions",33
NA,there was no remedy for any citizen against,33
NA,"the Commonwealth Government, and that",33
NA,"in orderfcosupply thafc defect the Bill,",33
NA,"as i t then stood, should be passed. I pointed",33
NA,"out, however, that the measure was not so",33
NA,"wide i n its scope as i t ought to be, and",33
NA,how any one could sue the Minister for,33
NA,Trade and Customs under its provisions,33
NA,any wrong done. To that remark one Section,33
NA,honorable member interjected that the Bil,33
NA,did provide a remedy for wrong,33
NA,I pointed out that no writ of mandamus or,33
NA,injunction could be obtained against the officer,33
NA,"Minister, and said :-",33
NA,The Minister can detain goods at his own sweet,33
NA,"will to-morrow, and no one has any remedy",33
NA,against him ; and we know the nice idea of justice,33
NA,which the Minister for Trade and Customs has,33
NA,in some cases already. The Government,33
NA,"do not propose to remedy thafc state of affairs,",33
NA,although half-a-dozeu alterations in this Bill,33
NA,"would secure what was necessary, and give the",33
NA,of the country a remedy for wrongs done,33
NA,"A case has arisen, just as I then foresaw,",33
NA,and no writ of mandamus or injunction,33
NA,lies against the Minister. I n respect of,33
NA,"wrongs done i n this way, we have given no",33
NA,he rights to citizens; yet the Government .as-,33
NA,sented to this law with' their eyes open.,33
NA,Attorney-General now says that i n the,33
NA,event of the failure of the forms of action I,33
NA,"haye mentioned, a plaintiff has a remedy for",33
NA,deienue ; but I ask him whether there is any,33
NA,such remedy under section 207 of the Cus-,33
NA,he toms Act? I pointed out last year thafc,33
NA,there was no remedy i n law against the,33
Mr ISAACS , Is the honorable and,33
NA,learned member discussing the legal rights,33
Mr CONROY , I am discussing the,33
NA,"of remark of the Attorney-General, who said",33
NA,"a that a remedy can be obtained, andfchafcfche",33
NA,be case is sub judice. M y contention is that,33
NA,"case can never' be sub judice, because",33
NA,plaintiff has no remedy according to the,33
NA,who felt that he Customs Act.,33
Mr LE GROOM ,Th e honorable and,33
NA,learned member is giving an opinion on the,33
NA,to be done by plaintiff's case.,33
Mr CONROY , I am giving an opinion,33
NA,on the statement made by fche honorable,33
NA,Govern-and learned member for Darling Downs,33
NA,that thafc I was wrong in an expression of,33
NA,"opinion, and I am showing thafc, according",33
NA,"fco law, I was perfectly right. The law, as",33
NA,"read ifc, applies nofc only to the plaintiff",33
NA,"whose case is before us, but to every other",33
NA,"man, and I am merely showing how careful",33
NA,we should be to see thafc the Minister for,33
NA,even Trade and Customs administers tlie law as,33
NA,soundly as possible. When justice is denied,33
NA,"to individuals through the courts, ifc is im-",33
NA,asked perative that the Minister for Trade and,33
NA,Customs should see thafc justice is done fco,33
NA,for those who come under his administration.,33
NA,203 of the Customs A ct gives the,33
NA,l right to seize and detain goods ; and then,33
NA,done ; but comes section 207-,33
NA,Whenever any goods have been seized by an,33
NA,and claim to such goods has been sei-ved on,33
NA,fche Collector byfcheowner of such goods-,33
NA,I n the case of Mr Goldring that claim was,33
NA,"made on the 2nd December i n the first case,",33
NA,"and again on 2nd February, but to neither",33
NA,communication was any reply given by the,34
NA,Customs authorities.,34
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Why should,34
NA,Minister for Trade and Customs deign to,34
NA,reply to anybody t,34
Mr CONROY , I admit that i t is outview,34
NA,rageous on the part of anybody to expect,34
NA,obtain justice i n the Customs Department;,34
NA,but I am supposing that matters of this,34
NA,kind come under the notice of the Minister.,34
NA,Section 207 of the Customs A ct proceeds-,34
NA,-th e Collector may retain possession of,34
NA,goods without taking any proceedings for their,34
NA,condemnation-,34
NA,I t will be seen that in one sense the Minthe,34
NA,ister was justified ; but the section connothing,34
NA,tinues-,34
NA,-an d may by notice under his hand require,34
NA,claimant to enter an action against him for,34
NA,recovery of the goods.,34
NA,"The Customs authorities gave no notice,",34
NA,though they were the only parties who could,34
NA,"do so j and unless such notice be given,",34
NA,unfortunate plaintiff is in the position of,34
NA,having no remedy. The Customs A c t also,34
NA,provides that i f a claimant does not within,34
NA,"four months enter an action, the goods shall",34
NA,be deemed to be condemned. I t was perter,34
NA,"fectly open to the Customs authorities,",34
NA,"they thought the goods should be condemned,",34
NA,to send a reply to that effect i n answer,34
NA,the claim made by Mr Goldring. But,34
NA,no such course was followed; and i t,34
NA,the fact that i f a plaintiff proceeds for,34
NA,the recovery of goods he may be met members,34
NA,"with section 207, which, as a matter",34
NA,"law, decides the case. I f a plaintiff",34
NA,"ceeds for the recovery of documents, he may",34
NA,be met with the proposition that section,34
NA,"settles the matter, because i t is there",34
NA,clared that the Collector may impound,34
NA,"retain "" any documents presented i n",34
NA,"nexion with any entry, or required",34
NA,"produced under the Act."" Honorable",34
NA,bers will see the nice way in which the,34
NA,torney-General tries to coax plaintiffs,34
NA,believe that they have a remedy.,34
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Si r Julian Salomons,34
NA,said that the plaintiff had a remedy.,34
Mr CONROY ,"Si r Julian Salomons,",34
NA,appearing as he did on behalf of the Go-,34
NA,"vernment, made a statement furnished to",34
NA,"him by the Attorney-General, and probably",34
NA,made i t without himself looking into the,34
NA,two sections to which I have referred. The,34
NA,honorable and learned member for Bendigo,34
NA,is aware that if the Attorney-General,34
NA,passed over such an instruction to Sir,34
NA,"Julian Salomons, the latter might possibly",34
NA,make the statement on such an authority,34
NA,the without further investigation. But i f Sir,34
NA,"Julian Salomons had looked into the matter,",34
NA,I guarantee that he would take the same,34
NA,"as I do, and as I believe the honorable",34
NA,"to and learned member for Bendigo, or even any",34
NA,"layman, so clear is the law, would take on",34
NA,reading the section. There is no remedy at,34
NA,the present time foraplaintiff unless and until,34
NA,section 207 or some part of i t is complied with,34
NA,the by the Minister. I f the Minister likes to,34
NA,give notice in writing requiring a claimant to,34
NA,"enter an action, then an action will lie. I n",34
NA,"present case, however, the Minister did",34
NA,"of the sort, and there is no way in",34
NA,which he can be compelled except by writ,34
NA,the of mandamus. A case of this sort must im-,34
NA,the press on the Minister the necessity of pro-,34
NA,ceeding most carefully i n cases where men,34
NA,alwho may be wronged have no remedy afc,34
NA,law. I can scarcely conceive a worse state,34
NA,an of affairs. I do not doubt that i f other,34
NA,"Ministers, who are not supported by stringent",34
NA,"sections i n an Act, were to do certain",34
NA,"things, an action of tort would lie in various",34
NA,cases ; but no action lies against the Minis-,34
NA,for Trade and Customs when he' seizes,34
NA,i f and retains goods or documents. Under the,34
NA,circumstances I think that the position,34
NA,to taken up by the Attorney-General is un-,34
NA,worthy of the Ministry as a whole. I t is,34
NA,is the absence of legal remedy which causes,34
NA,trouble i n other countries. I f honorable,34
NA,on the other side had had the fore-,34
NA,of sight and knowledge of members of the,34
NA,"proOpposition, when some of these Acts",34
NA,"were - under consideration, provisions such",34
NA,215 as those to which I have referred,34
NA,dewould have been guarded against. I re-,34
NA,or member that even the honorable member,34
NA,confor Melbourne supported members of the,34
NA,to be Opposition and myself when we spoke,34
NA,memagainst the arbitrary power given to the,34
NA,A t - Minister for Trade and Customs. ' As the,34
NA,"to Minister declines to give an answer, and",34
NA,"there is no motion before the House, I have",34
NA,taken oh myself to answer those of the,34
NA,Attorney-General's remarks which repre-,34
NA,"sent this case as practically, if not",34
NA,"technically, sub judice. I shall take an",34
NA,opportunity at a subsequent period of,34
NA,again bringing this matter under the,34
NA,notice of honorable members. I wish,34
NA,now to refer to the administration of,34
NA,the Post. and Telegraph Department.,34
NA,I am glad to see that the Minister repre-,34
NA,senting the Postmaster-General is in the,34
NA,"Chamber. What we, who represent New respect",35
NA,"South Wales, have to complain of is that",35
NA,proposed extensions of telephone services,35
NA,throughout country districts are absolutely,35
NA,blocked. Those who apply for such extenwhich,35
NA,"sions are asked to furnish cash guarantees,",35
NA,which often greatly exceed the amounts for,35
NA,which they could construct the lines they,35
NA,ask for. I will mention such an instance.,35
NA,The-Government were asked to construct,35
NA,"telephone from Goulburn to Bungonia, and",35
NA,they required a cash deposit of £40 0 from,35
NA,"tbe applicants. Those who wanted the Department;,",35
NA,line advertised in the newspapers for tenders,35
NA,"for its construction, and found that the",35
NA,posts and wires could be furnished and,35
NA,"erected for less than £200 , though not,",35
NA,"course, in the same substantia] manner.",35
NA,thev are not allowed to construct the line,35
NA,"themselves, although they are willing to",35
NA,and by doing so would do no injury to the,35
NA,Post and Telegraph Department.,35
NA,were proposed to use the line for messages,35
NA,"which would deprive the Government of Postmaster-General,",35
NA,"revenue, one could understand the objection",35
NA,to its erection. But they wish to use,35
NA,"purely for their own business, and the",35
NA,interests of fche public could not,35
NA,its construction by private hands.,35
NA,"being so, is there any reason or fairness in",35
NA,the action of the Department in refusing,35
NA,"construct the line, and in declining to allow",35
NA,those who want ifc to do so 1 I,35
NA,"or two, but half-a-dozen similar cases, some of",35
NA,"which I referred to the other day, i n which",35
NA,the parties interested are willing to furnish,35
NA,"their own material, and to do the work,",35
NA,they are not allowed. I n all cases cash,35
NA,"guarantees are required, and these guarantees",35
NA,are out of all proportion to the advantages,35
NA,to be looked for. Why are telephones,35
NA,"quired, i f ifc is not to bring the residents",35
NA,country districts easily wifchinfchereach,35
NA,"civilization, and to compensate them to",35
NA,extent for the many disadvantages which,35
NA,they suffer i n being far away from large,35
NA,centres of population. I t is those who,35
NA,"engaged in the occupation of the land,",35
NA,"whether-for pastoral, agricultural, or",35
NA,"ing purposes, who are doing most to develop",35
NA,"the country, and upon whom we all rely",35
NA,"the production of wealth, who require",35
NA,"convenience. Yet, ever since the present to",35
NA,"PoStmaster-General came into office, fche therefore he cannot understand",35
NA,members of those three great classes,35
NA,have been practically denied extensions,35
NA,of fche telephone service. The Minister,35
NA,is letting matters get behind i n this,35
NA,4 Y,35
NA,"in the most ridiculous way, so that",35
NA,all one cannot see how things will end.,35
NA,Many of the applications for telephone,35
NA,extensions come from centres of population,35
NA,would have been connected by tele-,35
NA,"phone long since, if, under one pretext or",35
NA,"another, that advantage had nofc been denied",35
NA,"to them. To my mind, the question is of",35
NA,such importance that when the Post and,35
NA,"a Telegraph Estimates come before us, I in-",35
NA,tend to move their reduction by an amount,35
NA,equivalent to the salary of the head of the,35
NA,and I have not the slightest -,35
NA,doubt thafc other honorable members will,35
NA,"support me, i f not in striking out that",35
NA,"amount, in reducing his salaiy by the",35
NA,of £400 which he receives as a member of the,35
NA,But Senate. Representations to him are abso-,35
NA,"lutely useless, and i t is high time that action",35
NA,"do so, was taken. I am not one of those who be-",35
NA,i lieve that Ministers receive too much. I,35
NA,I f i t do not think thafc they receive enough. But,35
NA,"ifc is clear fco methat, in the case of the",35
NA,too much is beinff sriven,35
NA,to a man who is so mismanaging affairs,35
NA,"ifc fchafc, in a great State like New South",35
NA,"Wales, practically no extension of the",35
NA,suffer by telephone service is possible.,35
NA,That,35
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Applicant s for ex-,35
NA,"to tensions are practically held by the throat,",35
NA,and all because the Department has lost a,35
NA,"know, not one few pounds in the past.",35
Mr CONROY , Because on former,35
NA,occasions the guarantees were nofc examined,35
NA,"with the necessary strictness, and a little",35
NA,but money was lost. Instead of strictly ex-,35
NA,"amining the' guarantees, the Department",35
NA,are preventing all extension. Why should,35
NA,a country like New South Wales be governed,35
NA,rein this matter by a gentleman who has come,35
NA,"in from Queensland, and who--possibl y be-",35
NA,of cause he has practically had nothing to do,35
NA,some with telephonic communication in the past,35
NA,-doe s nofc understand that others should,35
NA,feel the want of i t . W i t h his attitude of,35
NA,"are mind, I can only think that i f he had nofc",35
NA,"been taught to read he would say- "" I do",35
NA,"minnofc read myself, and therefore I consider",35
NA,"all books to be useless."" Possibly he",35
NA,for is a man whose friends never telephone,35
NA,"fchis to him, because he would have nothing",35
NA,"say to fchern if they did, and",35
NA,thafc,35
NA,any one else should liave something to say.,35
NA,He apparently never requires to use the,35
NA,"telephone for business purposes, and, there-",35
NA,"fore, he cannot be made to see thafc i t is a",35
NA,necessary requirement for others.,36
NA,"ever, when tlie Estimates come before us;",36
NA,will take action for' the reductionof,36
NA,salarv by wav of protest.,36
Mr ELIAS SOLOMON ,Fremantle) - I,36
NA,think i t is to be deplored that occasion,36
NA,arisen for the discussion which we have,36
NA,"to-night in regard to a certain case, and",36
NA,"which has occupied nearly three hours,",36
NA,though now thafc the Minister has decided,36
NA,"not to give any explanation afc this stage,",36
NA,doubt ifc must come to an end. M y reason,36
NA,for rising is to bring before the Government,36
NA,one or two matters to which the attention,36
NA,of the Minister for Home Affairs was,36
NA,directed when he visited AVestern Australia,36
NA,two or three months back. He promised,36
NA,"look into those matters, and I am rather",36
NA,surprised thafc nothinghas been done.,36
NA,One of fche matters to which his atten-,36
NA,tion was directed was the state of the,36
NA,"Custom-house at Fremantle, and another",36
NA,fche state of the post-office there. Both,36
NA,buildings would be a disgrace to. any com-,36
NA,"munity, and they were in such a condition",36
NA,that the Minister was. afraid to go over fche,36
NA,premises where the clerks work. His atten-,36
NA,tion was also called to the high fees which,36
NA,have to be paid by licensed Custom-house,36
NA,agents. They complain very greatly of the,36
NA,"regulations which have been framed, i t",36
NA,"appears that, nofc only have they to find a",36
NA,guarantee of £ 5 0 0 for the honesty of their,36
NA,clerks generally; but they have to pay £5,36
NA,per annum for each clerk they employ on,36
NA,"Custom-house work, and if, through the",36
NA,illness or temporary incapacity of one of,36
NA,"these clerks, they have to employ another,",36
NA,"per.haps only for an hour or two, they must",36
NA,pay £ 5 for him. They complain very,36
NA,bitterly about that requirement ofthe,36
NA,regulations: I hope that fche Minister for,36
NA,Trade and Customswill look into the,36
NA,"matter, and, if possible, so alter the",36
NA,regulations thafc no fee will be charged,36
NA,"where a clerk is temporarily employed, the",36
NA,employers being regarded as under the fcha.n',36
NA,same conditions in respect to his employthe,36
NA,"ment as they are in respect tofcheemploythat,",36
NA,ment of their ordinary clerks. I trust that,36
NA,the Government will give attention to all,36
NA,"these grievances, and that we shall soon",36
NA,have satisfactory replies to the statements,36
NA,of the deputation which-waited upon the,36
NA,Minister for Home Affairs.,36

NA,thought he could score.,36
Sir EDMUND BARTON , I do nofc,36

NA,of the Constitution.,38
Sir EDMUND BARTON ,"Yes , but ifc",38
NA,may be that section 84 applies only,38

NA,actuated by the slightest personal feeling.,39
NA,Ifc would be simply ridiculous to make such,39
NA,a suggestion. But - I do think he has mis-,39
NA,conceived the whole principle which should,39
NA,-underlie the administration of a Depart-,39
NA,"ment involving great commercial interests,",39
NA,by instituting prosecutions for errors which,39
NA,"would be bound to occur, even i f angels",39
NA,from heaven came down to transact the,39
NA,business. I t is all very well to talk about,39
NA,this case being sub judice. Who made i t so ?,39
NA,Who forced Mr Goldring into the position,39
NA,which he has taken up. I have a memo-,39
NA,"randum here, from which I find that this case",39
NA,began upon 17th November of last year. I t,39
NA,contains page after page in which dates are,39
NA,recorded of communications forwarded to,39
NA,"the Department, and to which no replies",39
NA,have been forthcoming. When Mr Gold-,39
NA,.ring's business was at last brought to a,39
NA,"standstill, he wired to fche Minister-",39
NA,f When may I expect to receive reply to my,39
NA,"letter?"" To that telegram there was no",39
NA,reply. Finally he was compelled to send a,39
NA,"letter to the Department, complaining that",39
NA,no answer had been received to his com-,39
NA,"munications, and threatening proceedings by",39
NA,mandamus for detention of his goods. Who,39
NA,brought about that detention ? I am suffi-,39
NA,cient of a business man to know thafc nofc,39
NA,"-even fche Minister for Trade and Customs,",39
NA,who has made the police court a sort of,39
NA,"annexe to his Department, would do any-",39
NA,thing without a purpose. But I am told,39
NA,"that before this case occurred,fcheparticular",39
NA,"firm was "" marked,"" and that oflicers had",39
NA,been instructed to watch its proceedings.',39
Mr ISAACS ,Tha t is a very hard thing,39
NA,to say of a man who is nofc able to defend,39
NA,himself.,39
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , W h o is,39
NA,not able to defend himself? Unless the,39
NA,statements of fact contained in this' paper,39
NA,"are absolute untruths, I say that the case",39
NA,originated in suspicion on the part of the,39
NA,"Department, with the result that persecu-",39
NA,tion followed the man.,39
Mr CROUCH ,Doe s the honorable mem-,39
NA,ber know thafc there was no ground for,39
NA,out against certain suspicion ?,39
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h i s man,39
NA,imported a special class of goods for a,39
NA,special period of the year. Those goods,39
NA,were intended for the Christmas trade.,39
NA,He states-an d I suppose that he would,39
NA,be ready to swear to the fact-thaf c he,39
NA,offered to do anything and everything to,39
NA,comply with the wishes of the Customs,39
NA,authorities. He was prepared to enter into,39
NA,"any bond thafc could fairly be made out, and",39
NA,to put; up any deposit; to secure delivery of,39
NA,his goods. But he was unable to obtain,39
NA,"them. I n passing, i t is worthy of remark",39
NA,fchafcfcheadministration of the Customs De-,39
NA,"partment, especially under a new Tariff, is",39
NA,necessarily a difficult task. But under the,39
NA,"present Tariff, ifc is doubly difficult. The",39
NA,fact; that ifc contains so many technicalities,39
NA,fchafc the Minister has had' to issue a large,39
NA,book to explain them is in itself a condem-,39
NA,"nation of it. Under these circumstances,",39
NA,every assistance should be rendered to im-,39
NA,"porters, and no man should be considered a",39
NA,rogue until he has been convicted. Un-,39
NA,"fortunately, however, under the pre-",39
NA,sent system of Customs administration,39
NA,every importer is considered a rogue;,39
NA,"and even when fraud is not proved, but",39
NA,when the proof to the contrary is over-,39
NA,"whelming, fche Minister demands thafc he",39
NA,"shall be brought before a police court,",39
NA,"branded as a criminal, and either fined or",39
NA,sent to gaol.,39
Mr HUME COOK ,Wh o is the honorable,39
NA,member's authority for the statement thafc,39
NA,"Goldring was a "" marked"" man ?",39
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I am,39
NA,nofc going to tell the honorable member.,39
NA,Probably he has very little regard for com-,39
NA,mon justice. So strong is party feeling in,39
NA,"fchis matter, that not one honorable member",39
NA,upon the other side of the House has risen,39
NA,to condemn the Minister. I have no de-,40
NA,sire to labour this question. I t has been,40
NA,elaborated in a very able speech by the,40
NA,"honorable member for Macquarie, who had",40
NA,no desire to attack the Minister. I know,40
NA,that the facts of the case were placed,40
NA,before that honorable member by Mr.,40
NA,Goldring. Under all the circumstances i t,40
NA,is remarkable that not a single honorable,40
NA,member opposite attempts to protect the,40
NA,mercantile community which is so much,40
NA,assailed at the present .time.,40
Mr MAUGER ,W e try to protect,40
NA,"public, and that is more important.",40
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , T h e honeverything,40
NA,orable member - often protects himself as,40
NA,well as the public. Before concluding I,40
NA,desire to say a few words to the Minister,40
NA,"for Trade and Customs, which I had in-",40
NA,tended saying before I knew that this,40
NA,matter was to be brought up. I do so with,40
NA,every desire to see the Customs Department,40
NA,working as smoothly as possible in the,40
NA,interests of the public. By this time I,40
NA,think the Minister knows well enough that,40
NA,the great majority of the mercantile com-,40
NA,munity would be only too glad to assist,40
NA,"him in detecting the fraudulent man, and",40
NA,in seeing that the honest man is not inter-,40
NA,fered with. I believe that a suggestion was,40
NA,made by the Chamber of Commerce when,40
NA,the Minister was last in Sydney that some,40
NA,tribunal might be constituted-ther e might,40
NA,be a board appointed in Sydney and Mel-,40
NA,bourne-t o deal with cases of manifest,40
NA,"error, to which every business man is liable,",40
NA,instead offchepresent objectionable practice,40
NA,of hauling people before the courts.,40
Mr LE GROOM ,Doe s the honorable,40
NA,member mean a board outside of the De-,40
NA,partment ?,40
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I mean,40
NA,"a board in connexion with the Department,",40
NA,but one so constituted that ifc would be,40
NA,perfectly impartial. I think that in cases,40
NA,in which eitherfcheMinister or his oflicers,40
NA,are satisfied thafc an attempt has been made,40
NA,to defraud the revenue-the y would have to,40
NA,take the responsibility of deciding that,40
NA,matter-lega l proceedings should be institu-,40
NA,"ted. Similar]} , in cases of continued care-",40
NA,7,40
NA,lessness the offenders might be brought,40
NA,before fche police court. But where the,40
NA,Minister himself was satisfied with the,40
NA,"reputation of the firm, and the character",40
NA,of the mistake itself Clearly evidenced that,40
NA,"ifc was a pure inadvertence, the board",40
NA,should be empowered to levy fines. I know,40
NA,fchafcfcheMinister commenced the adminis-,40
NA,tration of his Department with certain pre-,40
NA,"conceived ideas. He understood, or thought",40
NA,"he understood, that.a large number of cases-",40
NA,were settled i n camera behind the backs of,40
NA,the public by the Ministers for Customs..,40
NA,"Accordingly he said- "" I will have nothing.",40
NA,"to do with that system.""",40
Mr KINGSTON ,Has the honorable mem-,40
NA,ber noticed the published figures which,40
NA,"disclose that £16,000 was collected in that,",40
NA,way in ten vears 1,40
the Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I allow,40
NA,"that the system is open to abuse, and that,",40
NA,ought be done in broad day-,40
NA,light. But the Minister has only one-,40
NA,alternative presented. He cannot pos-,40
NA,sibly go into the details of every case-,40
NA,and the only alternal ive open to him is to-,40
NA,send all cases of error into court -But.,40
NA,when Parliament conferred on him these-,40
NA,drastic powers ifc never imagined for a,40
NA,moment that where a trivial error occurred,40
NA,police court proceedings would follow. I,40
NA,give the Minister credit for endeavouring,40
NA,to conscientiously discharge his duby. I do-,40
NA,nofc impute to him the slightest personal-,40
NA,"motive, or anything savouring of prejudice-",40
NA,in his treatment of any individual. A t the-,40
NA,"same time, i t is felt by mercantile men",40
NA,thafc a terrible stigma is cast upon their -,40
NA,characters when they are brought before-,40
NA,fche police court to have ifc recorded that a,40
NA,"fine has been imposed upon them, with the",40
NA,"the option of fourteen days' imprisonment,",40
NA,because that fact may be used infchefutures,40
NA,"by the unscrupulous when these men, per-",40
NA,"haps, come before a court of law in the-",40
NA,"capacity of witnesses. Furthermore, i t is-",40
NA,fche business of the Minister to attract to,40
NA,his sSde the whole of the honorable trading,40
NA,community. The ideafchafca man with a.,40
NA,capital of thousands of pounds would act,40
NA,in collusion with a salaried officer who,40
NA,might blackmail him at any time is too,40
NA,ridiculous to entertain for a moment.,40
Mr KINGSTON ,W e cannot say that i t,40
NA,is impossible with any one.,40
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I t is,40
NA,"very improbable, and any man would be a",40
NA,"fool to so act. Of course, there are people",40
NA,conducting businesses of a certain size in,40
NA,which they could keep a secret to them-,40
NA,"selves, and in such instances there might be",40
NA,collusion with perfect safety. But in nine,40
NA,cases out of ten such a state of affairs is im-,40
NA,possible. We have a very complicated,40
NA,Tariff under which a duty is imposed upon,40
NA,"goods which are to be used for one purpose,",41
NA,whilst a different charge is levied upon,41
NA,.them i f they are to be used for another pur-,41
NA,pose. I n cases which have come before,41
NA,"me, I say that six persons, in determining",41
NA,"the amount of duty payable, might very",41
NA,well take one side and a similar number,41
NA,another.,41
Mr KINGSTON ,Ther e is no prosecution,41
NA,now uponthat score.,41
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , I am,41
NA,talking of the difficulties of passing,41
NA,.entries. I know that if an importer is,41
NA,in doubt he may pass a sight entry.,41
NA,Tliere have been inconsistencies in the deci-,41
NA,sions of Customs officers.,41
Mr KINGSTON ,Ther e have been no pro-,41
NA,secutions on account of differences of opin-,41
NA,ion as to duties.,41
Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN , The,41
NA,"Minister is the head of the Department,",41
NA,and his spirit actuates the whole administra-,41
NA,"tion. The Minister, with a keen senseof duty,",41
NA,and with a desire perhaps to make a. record,41
NA,for'thoroughness in the administration of the,41
NA,"Department, may have determined to strike",41
NA,terror into the hearts of those whom ho,41
NA,thinks to be fraudulent. But the result of,41
NA,carrying such a policy to an extreme-t o,41
NA,a point beyond that which common sense,41
NA,"sanctions, results very often in fear and",41
NA,paralysis amongst the officers of the De-,41
NA,"partment, and makes them tremble as",41
NA,to what may follow their decisions. I n,41
NA,"a great continent like this, with 8,000",41
NA,"miles of coast, the administration of",41
NA,the Department presents many difficulties.,41
NA,Instead of the very simple centralization we,41
NA,"formerly had in Sydney, Melbourne, and",41
NA,"Adelaide, difficulties must occur in matters",41
NA,"of interpretation, and broad powers ought",41
NA,to be given to the officers at the different,41
NA,ports. Where mistakes arise the authorities,41
NA,ought to be as lenient and as reasonable as,41
NA,are the mercantile public in regard to the,41
NA,' errors and inconsistent decisions of . the,41
NA,officers. I f there have been mistakes on the,41
NA,"part of merchants, I guarantee there have",41
NA,been just as many .mistakes of the same,41
NA,character and involving the same results by,41
NA,the Customs officers. I do not desire thafc,41
NA,any unnecessary heat should be imported,41
NA,into this discussion. I want to see the,41
NA,Tariff administered in a reasonable way. I,41
NA,.do not want to see the administration,41
NA,of the customs law at the ports of,41
NA,this country such that men who cOme,41
NA,here as merchants from other countries,41
NA,should have to appeal to fcheir own Minis-,41
NA,ters in Europe in order to get justice done,41
NA,afc the hands of our Government. The ad-,41
NA,ministration of the Commonwealth ought to,41
NA,be broader and more large-minded than that,41
NA,of the States; but in many respects I am,41
NA,afraid ifc has been almost more provincial.,41
NA,The case before us is a most extraordinary,41
NA,"one, and shows great persecution, if tho",41
NA,whole of the information given to us is not,41
NA,as huge a pack of lies as ifc is possible to,41
NA,put into two or three sheets of foolscap.,41
NA,"Although we may demand an inquiry, and",41
NA,perhaps feel some heat on tbe subject on,41
NA,"this side of the House, we recognise thafc we",41
NA,"have decided on a certain Tariff, and our",41
NA,object is to see the law administered in a,41
NA,"broad-minded manner-free , as far as"" is pos-",41
NA,"sible, from any friction of a nature calculated",41
NA,to injuriously affect the people of the coun-,41
NA,try.,41
Sir PHILIP FYSH ,Tasmania) -Tli e,41
NA,"honorable member for South Australia, Mr.",41
NA,"Poynton, has called attention towhat he",41
NA,has described as the improper subletting of,41
NA,contracts in the mail service. But the in-,41
NA,formation of the Department with respect to,41
NA,the particular instance to which he refers-,41
NA,"namely, the mail contract bebween Ballarat",41
NA,and Bokewood-i s that there is no sublet-,41
NA,ting. The inspector reports that Livingstone,41
NA,"is the servant of Messrs Cobb and Co., and is",41
NA,carrying the mails for thafc firm.,41
NA,NA,41
Sir PHILIP FYSH ,Th e Department,41
NA,does not recognise the right of contractors to,41
NA,"sublet contracts, and if the honorable mem-",41
NA,ber will furnish more explicit information,41
NA,inquiries will be made.,41
NA,NA,41
NA,Livingstone's -plant and horses which are,41
NA,used in the carriage offchemails.,41
Sir PHILIP FYSH , I have given the,41
NA,honorable member the information which is,41
NA,"in the possession of fche Department, and i t",41
NA,"will be for him, if - he thinks i t advisable, to",41
NA,follow the matter up and prove that the,41
NA,inspector has been misled.,41
NA,NA,41
NA,other similar cases.,41
Sir PHILIP FYSH ,Th e honorable,41
NA,member for Maranoa has called attention,41
NA,"to what he believes fco be a grievance, in",41
NA,thafc the telegraph line to Tarcoola was con-,41
NA,structed on conditions different from those,41
NA,which the Department seeks to observe in,41
NA,the provision of similar means of con*,41
NA,"munication fco Stonehenge, i n Queensland",41
NA,The honorable member is nofc satis ed with,42
NA,"the reply I gave on a former occasion, and",42
NA,states that there are circumstances asso-,42
NA,ciated with the proposed extension to Stone-,42
NA,henge which would warrant the Depart-,42
NA,ment; in beginning that work at once.,42
NA,The Deparbmenb wishes i t to be under-,42
NA,stoodfchafcthe circumstances which warrant,42
NA,the construction of fche line to Tarcoola,42
NA,are such fchafc if analogous circumstances,42
NA,be proved in the case of the Stonehenge,42
NA,"line, the latter will be constructed on",42
NA,similar conditions. I f the Government,42
NA,"of Queensland, after inquiring into the pros-",42
NA,"pects of the Stonehenge line, arrive at the",42
NA,conclusion that ifc is a proper line to be con-,42
NA,structed on terms under which the cost will,42
NA,"be charged to them,fchework will be carried",42
NA,out onfchesame principle as that observed,42
NA,in fche case of fche Tarcoola line. The,42
NA,honorable member for Rourke has called,42
NA,attention to a matter which has been men-,42
NA,tioned on many occasions. The honorable,42
NA,member asked whether certain officers in,42
NA,fche clerical or general division of the public,42
NA,service are entitled to the minimum salary,42
NA,"of £ 1 1 0 per annum, and, i f so, why they",42
NA,have not received thafc salary. I n every,42
NA,instance where I have had occasion to ask,42
NA,for further information on this subject from,42
NA,"fche public service officials, the reply has in-",42
NA,variably been thafc no instance is known,42
NA,where officers entitled fco fchis minimum,42
NA,wage have not received ifc. I f there be any,42
NA,"complaints with respect to individual cases,",42
NA,"these, if mentioned to the Minister, will be",42
NA,"inquired into, and any error promptly",42
NA,rectified. As to the remarks of the honor-,42
NA,able and learned member for Werriwa on,42
NA,"the Post-office administration generally, I",42
NA,"laid on the table, within the last few days,",42
NA,a reply to a question asked by an honorable,42
NA,member with regard to the number of tele-,42
NA,phone extensions which have been asked,42
NA,for. I f honorable members will read that,42
NA,reply they will see that the Department is,42
NA,not afc all warranted in making extensions,42
NA,unless there be reasonable prospects of fche,42
NA,lines paying.,42
Mr FULLER ,Th e Department will not,42
NA,construct lines even where there is a,42
NA,reasonable prospect of their paying.,42
Sir PHILIP FYSH , I am satisfied that,42
NA,where the 'Department sees a fair prospect,42
NA,of the cost of construction and interest,42
NA,"being paid, they will readily undertake fche",42
NA,work.,42
Mr FULLER ,Th e Department will not,42
NA,do so.,42
Sir PHILIP FYSH , I ask honorable,42
NA,members to give me specific instances where,42
NA,the construction of telephone lines afc a,42
NA,"moderate cost is likely to pay, and I shall",42
NA,take carefcolay them beforefchePostmaster-,42
NA,General.,42
Mr FULLER , I have brought one such,42
NA,instance under the notice of the House two,42
NA,or three times.,42
Sir PHILIP FYSH , I n every instance,42
NA,"brought'under observation, fche Postmaster-",42
NA,General has had sufficient reason for de-,42
NA,"clining to undertake the suggested work,",42
NA,whether i t has been the extension of the tele-,42
NA,"graph or telephone system, or the erection",42
NA,"of buildings. However, i f honorable mem-",42
NA,bers will lay before me specific in-,42
NA,stances where fchey deem fchafc telephone,42
NA,"lines may be profitably constructed, they",42
NA,"will be property inquired into, and good",42
NA,reasons given if the work cannot be carried,42
NA,out.,42
Mr FULLER ,Illawarra) -I n reply to,42
NA,the invitation of the Minister for specific,42
NA,instances where telephone lines might pro-,42
NA,"fitably be constructed, I desire to say that",42
NA,some twelve months ago I brought under the,42
NA,notice of the Postmaster-General the advis-,42
NA,ability of establishing such communication,42
NA,between the Illawarra district of New,42
NA,South Wales and Sydney. The llawarra,42
NA,district is fche second largest industrial,42
NA,centre in that State. There are on the,42
NA,south coast fifteen or sixteen coal mines in,42
NA,"full swing, large smelting works, at leasfc",42
NA,"nine or ten large coke works, and a number",42
NA,of other large industries. A report obtained,42
NA,by fche Posfcinaster-General showed that the,42
NA,telephone line which I advocate can,42
NA,"be constructed for about £3,000 odd.",42
NA,Personally I should be very glad to,42
NA,have the opportunity of constructing this,42
NA,"line, because I feel perfectly satisfied that ifc",42
NA,would pay splendidly from the outset. But,42
NA,the Postal Department will not do anything,42
NA,towards the work until they receive a cash,42
NA,guarantee of £700. Under ordinary circum-,42
NA,stances there is no difficulty in finding £700,42
NA,"in the Illawarra district, but whafc people",42
NA,are to be asked fco put down a cash,42
NA,guarantee of £ 7 0 0 for five years in order,42
NA,to have a work carried out for the benefit,42
NA,of every resident i n the district ! There-,42
NA,1,42
NA,suit is that fche whole proposal is in abey-,42
NA,"ance because, under the circumstances,",42
NA,nobody is prepared to produce the money.,42
NA,This is a specific instance where fche con-,43
NA,"-sfcrjuction of a telephone would, in the",43
NA,opinion of everybody who knows the dis-,43
NA,"trict, pay from the very start; and yet",43
NA,"the Postal Department, in asking for",43
NA,"a guarantee, are really keeping back",43
NA,'the industries of the locality. There is,43
NA,-another matter to which I should like,43
NA,"""to call attention. Yesterday I asked",43
NA,the Minister representing the Postmaster-,43
NA,General a question in connexion with,43
NA,the payment of overtime due to certain,43
NA,-clerical officers in the General Post Office,43
NA,-Sydney. These officers were brought back,43
NA,"night after night for weeks, and in some",43
NA,"-cases for months, and worked until half-",43
NA,past ten or eleven o'clock ; and some months,43
NA,ago application was made for the payment,43
NA,-of overtime in accordance with the custom,43
NA,which has hitherto prevailed in fche Postal,43
NA,Department in New South Wales. I am,43
NA,sure every honorable member will agree,43
NA,that men who work overtime as these,43
NA,men have done are entitled to extra,43
NA,remuneration. The answer I received,43
NA,when I brought this matter under fche,43
NA,notice of the Postmaster-General some,43
NA,months ago was that inquiries were,43
NA,being made in the other States as to,43
NA,whether similar application for overtime,43
NA,had fchere been made. That is no excuse,43
NA,"'for not dealing with the case of these men,",43
NA,who either are or are not entitled to re-,43
NA,"muneration, irrespective of what is done",43
NA,°in bhe other States. This.matter has been,43
NA,-allowed to stand over for an inexcusable,43
NA,"length of time, and I trust fchafc fche Post-",43
NA,"master-General will, in the interests of fche",43
NA,"men who have done this extra work, deal",43
NA,with i t without further delay.,43
Mr GLYNN ,South Australia) - I shall,43
NA,not detain the House more than a few,43
NA,minutes. I wish to refer to the Goldring,43
NA,-case merely for the purpose of stating that,43
NA,"I think that, technically, ifc cannot be said",43
NA,to be sub judice. I t is not long since I had,43
NA,"-occasion to look into the question- "" When""",43
NA,"is an action pending?"" and the decision I",43
NA,-came to upon fche authorities was that an,43
NA,action is not pending until a writ has been,43
NA,"issued, even though proceedings may be",43
NA,threatened. The position of fche Govern-,43
NA,ment is merely fchis-that they have an idea,43
NA,"""that an action may be brought against",43
NA,them.,43
Mr DEAKIN ,W e have had a request to,43
NA,"mppoinfc a nominal defendant, coupled with",43
NA,"""the formal intimation thafc the application",43
NA,was being made for the purpose of bringing,43
NA,an action for damages against us.,43
Mr GLYNN ,Thatnotic e onlyamounted,43
NA,"to a notice of intention to take action,",43
NA,"and, strictly speaking, proceedings have",43
NA,not yet been commenced. The Govern-,43
NA,ment is simply in the position in,43
NA,which an ordinary individual to whom an,43
NA,intimation had been given thafc proceed-,43
NA,ings would be taken would be. One can,43
NA,nevertheless understand the action of the,43
NA,"Minister i n allowing "" silence to sit droop-",43
NA,"at ing"" upon him, instead of obeying his usual",43
NA,inclination to defend his Customs adminis-,43
NA,"tration. I think, however, that he should",43
NA,defend his action in detaining goods in fchis,43
NA,case for eight months. I know of one case,43
NA,in which he detained goods for twelve,43
NA,months. There were two prosecutions,43
NA,"within that period, one of which succeeded,",43
NA,"and the other of which failed, but the goods",43
NA,"were.not released, and the Minister did not",43
NA,declare whether he intended to proceed to,43
NA,forfeiture. Why? Possibly because he,43
NA,was fishing for further evidence. I n this,43
NA,instance I suppose he sawfchafche had on the,43
NA,"evidence no case on which to proceed, and",43
NA,"therefore said, "" I will exercise my statutory",43
NA,power to retain the goods while I look,43
NA,"round for sufficient evidence."" Surely Par-",43
NA,liament did not intend that he should have,43
NA,these extraordinary powers of seizure ex-,43
NA,cept as ancillary to the taking of proceed-,43
NA,ings. Ifc was nofc intended thafc goods,43
NA,"should be seized upon mere suspicion, and",43
NA,without the existence of facts upon which,43
NA,an information could be laid.,43
Mr DEAKIN ,Ther e is another side to,43
NA,the case.,43
Mr GLYNN , I cannot see thafc there is,43
NA,"another side to the case, if the Department",43
NA,were not ready to take action. When,43
NA,the Claims Against the Commonwealth,43
NA,"Bill was before this House, i t was pointed",43
NA,out by the honorable and learned mem-,43
NA,"ber for Werriwa and by myself, that if",43
NA,the Minister kept goods for twelve years,43
NA,the owner could not obtain a writ of man-,43
NA,damus to compel him to deliver them.,43
NA,"That remedy was refused then, though ifc is",43
NA,being given by the Judiciary Bill. I n this',43
NA,"case, however, an opportunity might and",43
NA,should have been given by the Minister to,43
NA,the owner offchegoods to test his position,43
NA,by action. When the goods were de-',43
NA,"tained under section 207 of the Customs Act,",43
NA,the Minister should have given the owner,43
NA,"notice to proceed. But, as thafc notice was",43
NA,"-not given, Goldring was practically debarred",44
NA,from obtaining redress. He .might have,44
NA,brought an action at .common law for,44
NA,"conversion, but it is ""very doubtful that",44
NA,"-he would have succeeded, because the",44
NA,Minister has a statutory power to seize,44
NA,"goods without explanation, and is not",44
NA,bound to commence proceedings in regard to,44
NA,the seizure for a period of five years.,44
NA,indicates that if Goldring had brought an,44
NA,"action at common law, he might have been",44
NA,met with the defence that the Minister,44
NA,"was entitled to seize the goods, and could",44
NA,"not be made to deliver them up, because",44
NA,the Act allowed him to defer the taking of,44
NA,"proceedings for five years, and he had given",44
NA,no indication of his intention not to pro-,44
NA,ceed. The court might say that the,44
NA,reasonableness of the duration of the deten-,44
NA,tion depended upon the time within which,44
NA,"proceedings m ight be taken, and under the Act",44
NA,proceedings need not be taken for five years.,44
NA,Surely the Minister ought either to have,44
NA,"laid an information against Goldring, or to",44
NA,have given notice to him under the provi-,44
NA,sions of section 207 of the Customs Act.,44
NA,That section contains what is really a moral,44
NA,injunction to the Minister to give such,44
NA,notice after a formal claim had been .made,44
NA,and no information laid. It was a very,44
NA,harsh thing to leave the owner of the,44
NA,"goods in his present position, with the",44
NA,mere possibility of an action at common,44
NA,"law, in which he might be defeated.",44
NA,There is another matter with relation to the,44
NA,administration of the Customs which I re-,44
NA,gret to have to bring forward on this occa-,44
NA,"sion, but I see no other way of making it",44
NA,public. In a letter which I have re-,44
NA,"ceived, a complaint is made by a firm that",44
NA,duties are being collected by the Minister,44
NA,upon goods in respect to which there is no,44
NA,"liability under the Tariff' - In one instance,",44
NA,the Collector of Customs for New South,44
NA,Wales proceeded against Messrs. Mason,44
NA,Brothers to recover duty upon certain,44
NA,cartridges which were imported by them.,44
NA,As will be seen by a reference to our Hansard,44
NA,"reports, honorable members were of the opi-",44
NA,"nion, when they were dealing with the Tariff,",44
NA,that cartridges should be admitted,44
NA,"free, and they are free; but the Minister,",44
NA,actuated by the desire to collect sis much,44
NA,"revenue as possible, decided that the Tariff",44
NA,"exemption applied only to blank cartridges,",44
NA,and that duty should be levied upon the,44
NA,quantity of shot contained in loaded car-,44
NA,tridges. When the matter came before the,44
NA,Mr Glynn.,44
NA,"Pull Court in Sydney, -however, the conten-",44
NA,tion of the Government was almost laughed,44
NA,at by the Jiidges. I t might naturally be-,44
NA,asked-Wha t became of the duty wrongfully,44
NA,collected previous to this decision % Was the,44
NA,money returned to those from whom ib was-,44
NA,"wrongly taken ? Of course, the fact is that",44
NA,once money goes into the coffers of the-,44
NA,That Customs' Department there is no getting ifc,44
NA,"out again. I t almost invariably happens,",44
NA,that where a mistake is .made by a Govern-,44
NA,"ment in the interpretation offchelaw, there-",44
NA,is neither the recognition by thorn of the-,44
NA,moral obligation to make good the wrong,44
NA,"they have done, nor statutory power to enable-",44
NA,private individuals to compel them to do so.,44
NA,"But, inasmuch as duties wrongfully col-",44
NA,lected are never returned to those from,44
NA,"whom they were taken, surely we should",44
NA,"have, if not a liberal, a fair interpretation",44
NA,of the Tariff. Let us look at one of the-,44
NA,"many instances in which the Minister, i t",44
NA,"is alleged, has, by his interpretation of the-",44
NA,"Tariff, collected thousands of pounds of",44
NA,duty which should not have gone into,44
NA,the Commonwealth revenue. .There is no-,44
NA,such line in the Tariff as flax or jute-,44
NA,"tarpaulin canvas. But the Minister has,",44
NA,".for some reason, decided that jute tarpaulin",44
NA,"canvas must be admitted free, and thab",44
NA,"a duty of 5 per cent, is 'to be - imposed",44
NA,upon flax tarpaulin canvas as linen and,44
NA,cotton piece goods. This is not only an,44
NA,unfair interpretation from the point of view,44
NA,"of the importer, but i t is an absurd one-",44
NA,"from tbe point of view of the protectionist,,",44
NA,inasmuch as he is taxing the manufactured,44
NA,article only at the same rate as that at,44
NA,which he taxes the material from which i t,44
NA,is made. I n the letter to which I have,44
NA,"alluded, the Minister's action is commented",44
NA,"upon in very strong terms, and i t concludes",44
NA,with this statement-,44
NA,There is no doubt that thousands of pounds are-,44
NA,collected which the Department is not entitled,44
NA,to. I t is all very well for Mr Kingston to cry,44
NA,"protect the revenue, but there is no justification",44
NA,for collecting one penny more than the Legislature,44
NA,authorizes him to. There is a very evident desire,44
NA,"on the part of ths Customs, not only to take their",44
NA,"pound of flesh, but to read into the Tariff, duties,",44
NA,duty which were never contemplated by the framers.,44
NA,I should not have quoted that paragraph i f,44
NA,"I did not think that the instances given,",44
NA,"and of which I have mentioned one, justify",44
NA,the statements of the writer.,44
Mr CROUCH ,Corio) - I should like,44
NA,to say a word or two in reference tofchecases,44
NA,about which we have heard so much this.,44
NA,afternoon. With regard to the 'Goldring,45
NA,"matter,, upon twhich the honorable member",45
NA,for Macquarie . made such an exhaustive,45
NA,speech I - should like to say that although,45
NA,formerly I thought that solicitors .in Mel-,45
NA,bourne knew pretty well how to conduct,45
NA,"their cases, I now find that they must",45
NA,go to Sydney to learn points. I can see,45
NA,that i t would be wise for a solicitor who,45
NA,has a client to defend against the Cus-,45
NA,toms Department to go to his parliamentary,45
NA,representative and ask him to bring tire case,45
NA,"up in Parliament, and demand, almost at",45
NA,"the point of the bayonet, the disclosure of",45
NA,the intended line of defence-,45
Mr SYDNEY SMITH ,Tha t is a suggesmakes,45
NA,tion worthy of the honorable and learned to,45
NA,"member, seeing that I brought the matter given",45
NA,up in the House before I so much as knew,45
NA,Mr Goldring.,45
Mr CROUCH , I am glad that,45
NA,honorable friend considers the suggestion,45
NA,worthy of me. .Looking at the matter tunate,45
NA,"from the solicitor's point of view, I .can",45
NA,"that a large .part of the correspondence,",45
NA,"written before the solicitor's letter, -bears",45
NA,internal evidence of having been dictated,45
NA,"and prepared by a solicitor. That being so,",45
NA,"i t is hardlyright to expect that, the defendant",45
NA,should show his hand.,45
Mr SYDNEY SMITH , I defy .the - Minmembers,45
NA,ister to contradict any of the statements,45
NA,contains.,45
Mr CROUCH , I think that those who I,45
NA,have referred to the Minister's position,45
NA,relating to .a certain prosecution i n regard,45
NA,"to an evasion of the tea duty , should",45
NA,remember that i n that case the Minister,45
NA,"was the prosecutor, and the. defendant hima",45
NA,self really brought the case into this House,45
NA,so as to make i t necessary for-the Minister,45
NA,speak. .That was quite a different case.,45
NA,"this instance, there can be no obligation upon",45
NA,the Minister to injure the interests of the,45
NA,Commonwealth by a disclosureof his defence.,45
NA,I listened with a great deal of appreciation,45
NA,to the statement of the Prime,45
NA,regard to the officers who are affected by,45
NA,operation of section 19 of the Victorian of,45
NA,Public Service A c t of 1900. I feel sure,45
NA,that those officers who asked the,45
NA,member for Yarra to bring the matter beI,45
NA,fore the House do not want any more than,45
NA,"their legal rights, and thafc fchey will",45
NA,satisfied with the promise that .their,45
NA,terests will be protected to the fullest exafter,45
NA,tent. I feel certain that-the Prime Minisfco,45
NA,ter's .careful consideration will .show,45
NA,"fchey are entitled to all they ask, and I",45
NA,therefore view the result with confidence.,45
NA,I thank him. My principal purpose in rising,45
NA,was to direct attention to a matter regarding,45
NA,which a question was asked this afternoon,45
NA,by the honorable member for Wide Bay.,45
NA,I t is nofc necessaryfcocriticise the action of,45
NA,the Governor-General ; i t is quite sufficient-,45
NA,to direct attentionfcothedates of the cor*,45
NA,respondence which took place. On the 30fch,45
NA,"September, 1902, His Excellency the Gover-",45
NA,"nor-General wrote to Mr Chamberlain, and",45
NA,in the fifth and sixth paragraphs of his,45
NA,communication said :-,45
NA,In section 25 you will perceive that Mr Deakin,45
NA,a strong point of there being no regulations,45
NA,prescribe tbe method in which effect is to be,45
NA,to the deportation provisions of the Federal,45
NA,Act. I t seems to me important that these regula-,45
NA,tions should be drawn up and approved of by,45
NA,Parliament as explanatory offcheKanaka Bill,45
NA,my before the Royal assent is given.,45
NA,The Prime Minister recognised the unfor-,45
NA,"character of that phrase, and stated",45
NA,see thafc i t had not been used with bis know*,45
NA,"ledge or upon his advice. Eurther, he",45
NA,attempted to excuse ifc by saying that he-,45
NA,understood-that the document i n which it-,45
NA,occurred was a confidential communication.,45
NA,No. doubt the communication was of a con-,45
NA,"fidential character, because i f honorable-",45
NA,will note the reply of Mr Chamber-,45
NA,"i t lain, dated 14th November, they will see-",45
NA,the following words:-,45
NA,"have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of""",45
NA,3'our confidential despatch of 30th September.,45
NA,"I wish honorable members, and Ministers-",45
NA,"particularly, to consider whether tho",45
NA,Governor-General has any right to send,45
NA,"despatch, confidential or otherwise, to the",45
NA,Secretary of State for the Colonies without,45
NA,to his Ministers' consent. I n order to show,45
NA,I n that the communication was not rconfiden-,45
NA,tial in fche same sense as an ordinary pri-,45
NA,"vate note, I should like to point outfchafci n",45
NA,"the very letter which I have just quoted,",45
NA,Mr Chamberlain refers to a letter which,45
NA,Minister with was forwarded from-,45
NA,"fche your Acting Prime Minister, on the subject-",45
NA,a petition from certain Pacific Islanders resid-,45
NA,"ing in Queensland, with regard to the Pacific",45
NA,honorable Island Labourers Act 1901.,45
NA,think that any self-respecting Ministry,45
NA,should object to the terms of the letter for-,45
NA,be warded by His Excellency the Governor-,45
NA,"inGeperal to Mr Chamberlain, particularly",45
NA,he knew the Colonial-office had refused,45
NA,veto the Bill. I t is an attempt to defy,45
NA,"fchafc his Minister, and to alter the Imperial",45
NA,Government's approval of action already,46
NA,sanctioned. I n a communication dated the,46
NA,"16th May, Mr Chamberlain wrote to the",46
NA,"Governor of Queensland, Sir H . Chermside,",46
NA,as follows:-,46
NA,"I have the honour to acquaint you, for the",46
NA,"mation of your Ministers, that I have received",46
NA,from the Governor-General of Australia a copy of,46
NA,the representations made to him by your Govern-,46
NA,ment on bhe subject of the Pacific Island Labourers,46
NA,"Act, bub thab I have not felt justified in advising",46
NA,His Majesty bo disallow bhe measure.,46
NA,"I n a further communication, dated 30th",46
NA,"August, 1902, Mr Chamberlain says-",46
NA,You have already been informed bhab ib has,46
NA,been decided nob to advise His Majesty to dis-,46
NA,allow the Act. Thab decision was taken on the,46
NA,broad constitutional ground that the Act involves,46
NA,"no Imperial public interest, and that in other",46
NA,matters His Majesty's Government are not pre-,46
NA,pared to bake upon themselves the functions of a,46
NA,Courb of Appeal for bhe Parliamenb of a self-,46
NA,governing colon}'.,46
NA,I t will thus be seen that communications,46
NA,had already passed between Mr Chamber-,46
NA,"lain and the Government of Queensland,",46
NA,stating that i t was not intended to advise,46
NA,"His Majesty to disallow the Act, and yet",46
NA,"we find the Governor-General, acting without",46
NA,"the advice of his Ministers, stating on 3rd",46
NA,September-,46
NA,It seem9 to me imporfcanb that bhese regulations,46
NA,-should be drawn up aud approved of by Parlia-,46
NA,menb as explanatory of the Kanaka Bill before,46
NA,the Royal assent is given.,46
NA,I think that whether the communication,46
NA,was confidential or not it was the duty of,46
NA,"the Government immediately, upon ascer-",46
NA,"taining its nature, to tell the Governor-",46
NA,General that unless he withdrew his recom-,46
NA,mendation they would decline to act any,46
NA,further as his Ministers. I feel perfectly,46
NA,sure that the late Chief Justice Higin-,46
NA,"botham, of Victoria, who had a very keen",46
NA,appreciation of the rights and responsi-,46
NA,"bilities of the advisers to the Crown, would",46
NA,have taken up a position such as I have,46
NA,indicated at the time when he was acting,46
NA,as Attorney-General of that State.,46
NA,course adopted by His Excellency,46
NA,Governor-General reminds one of the time,46
NA,when George II. and George III.,46
NA,writing private letters to members of the,46
NA,House of Commons with a view to discredit,46
NA,their Ministers and to secure the rejection,46
NA,"of their Bills. The positions are parallel,",46
NA,because both were against the deliberate,46
NA,advice of their responsible Ministers.' I feel,46
NA,that my protest in this matter may be passed,46
NA,Mr CROUCH,46
NA,"unheeded at present, but I regard i t as abso-",46
NA,lutely necessary that we should safeguard our,46
NA,"constitutional rights, and allow the Gover-",46
NA,nor-General to act only upon the advice of,46
NA,his Ministers. Otherwise we may as well,46
NA,infor- give up all idea of responsible Government.,46
NA,I have from time to time raised my voice i n,46
NA,protest against the indifference displayed,46
NA,by the Ministry to the dignity attached to,46
NA,"their position as Ministers, and their duty",46
NA,"in this direction, and to the extent",46
NA,to which they are surrendering the rights,46
NA,which properly belong to us under our,46
NA,free institutions. I t has been announced,46
NA,"in regard to the Electoral Act, the Post",46
NA,"and Telegraph Act, and other measures",46
NA,which do not i n the slightest degree affect,46
NA,"Imperial interests, that by recommendation",46
NA,from the Colonial-office they had not been,46
NA,disallowed. We should not submit to being,46
NA,placed in such a position as this. Certain,46
NA,"of our rights are being thrown away, and i t",46
NA,will take us years and years in the future,46
NA,"to recover, them. M y voice may now be",46
NA,"as that of one crying in the wilderness, but",46
NA,I have not the slightest hesitation i n saying,46
NA,that i n years to come the' greatest regret,46
NA,will be expressed at the creation of such,46
NA,precedents-no t only afc the want of pro-,46
NA,test on the part of Ministers against fche,46
NA,"Governor-General's action, but i n regard to",46
NA,the whole course which the Ministry are,46
NA,pursuing in respect to communications with,46
NA,Colonial-office direction and dictation.,46
Mr HENRY WILLIS ,Robertson) -,46
NA,I wish to direct attention to the conditions,46
NA,"prevailing throughout New South Wales,",46
NA,and especially in the electorate which I,46
NA,"represent, with regard to the post and tele-",46
NA,graph services. We have heard to-day that,46
NA,in certain parts of Victoria the telegraph,46
NA,"service is very badly managed, and I can",46
NA,say the same thing with regard to the tele-,46
NA,phone services i n my own district. The,46
NA,authorities appear to be disinclined to pro-,46
NA,"vide telephone exchanges, even though quite",46
NA,a large number of people signify their inten-,46
NA,The tion to become subscribers. The greatest diffi-,46
NA,"the culty is experienced in transacting business,",46
NA,owing to the want of reasonable facilities.,46
NA,"were A t Wellington, for instance, a large",46
NA,"and populous town, fche business people are",46
NA,"urgently in need of a telephone service, and",46
NA,have signified their desire to be connected,46
NA,with an exchange. They have satisfied fche,46
NA,Department that the service would pay,46
NA,"from the outset; but the Government, al-",46
NA,though they have sent material into the,46
NA,"district, and have called for tenders for the",47
NA,"erection of the telephone wires, have for",47
NA,some reason stayed their hand. This has,47
NA,"been going on for the last two years, and",47
NA,although I have made repeated applications,47
NA,"to the Minister, no satisfactory explanation",47
NA,has been given. A t the last moment we,47
NA,have been told that there will have to be,47
NA,some alterations made at the local post-,47
NA,"office, and that the new work must be held",47
NA,in .abeyance until that change can be,47
NA,"effected. I n the meantime, apparently, the",47
NA,whole of the people in the town are to be,47
NA,kept waiting for facilities which should be,47
NA,immediately provided. The tradespeople are,47
NA,"placed at a great disadvantage, aud I think",47
NA,the Postmaster-General should make some,47
NA,satisfactory explanation with regard to the,47
NA,delay. The residents of Trangie have for,47
NA,sometime past urged that they should have,47
NA,opportunities of carrying on their business,47
NA,with the settlers in the neighbourhood who,47
NA,"are connected by telephone, in some cases,",47
NA,at their own expense. *Uhe Government,47
NA,will nofc open a telephone exchange in the,47
NA,town or provide a service between the,47
NA,"town and the railway station, a half-mile",47
NA,"distant, and the consequence is thab i t is",47
NA,really difficult fco make the fullest use of,47
NA,the facilities which have been provided,47
NA,partly by private enterprise.' The residents,47
NA,have gone the length of saying that they,47
NA,will bear the cost of making fche necessary,47
NA,"connexions by telephone, butfcheauthorities",47
NA,will neither put up the lines nor permit fche,47
NA,townspeople to do so. The Department,47
NA,"appears to be in a state of stagnation, and",47
NA,it would seem that the Ministerial head of,47
NA,i t is incompetent. Mr Scott appears to,47
NA,"direct all post and telegraph affairs, and",47
NA,from one end of Australia tofcheother fche,47
NA,same complaints are made. Therefore I,47
NA,think i t is time that we should have some,47
NA,explanation of the delay now occurring and,47
NA,as to the inefficiency and incompetence dis-,47
NA,played. I have receivedfchefollowing letter,47
NA,from a resident of Goolma written under,47
NA,date 20th June :-,47
NA,Over two years ago a numerously-signed peti-,47
NA,tion was presented to fche Deputy Postmaster-,47
NA,"General, Sydney, asking to have the place con-",47
NA,nected by telephone with either Mudgee or,47
NA,"Tumble, the former for preference. Several",47
NA,reputable well-to-do settlers gave their signa-,47
NA,tures as willing to become guarantors. After a,47
NA,lapse of over a year we received a letter from,47
NA,"Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, offering to",47
NA,connect with Mudgee providing a deposit of,47
NA,"£236 13s. 4d. be lodged in cash, or with Yamble",47
NA,for a cash deposit of £116 13s. 4d. The proposed,47
NA,"guarantors are not agreeable to part with so much,",47
NA,cash for the merely nominal interest paid by the,47
NA,Savings Bank. Ou these terms it is impossible,47
NA,to get the connexion. I have seen in the papers,47
NA,ana have heard from other sources thafc 3'ou have,47
NA,"interested yourself in our behalf in this direction,",47
NA,and on behalf of the residents of Goolma I have to,47
NA,thank you heartily for your past efforts and re-,47
NA,quest that you again exert yourself to secure us,47
NA,the convenience of telephonic communication. I,47
NA,would have no difficulty in getting reliable men.,47
NA,as guarantors.,47
NA,"I t is the duty of the Government, which",47
NA,enjoys a monopoly of the postal and tele-,47
NA,graphic communication within the Common-,47
NA,"wealth, to confer upon the people the facili-",47
NA,ties which are ordinarily enjoyed by every,47
NA,civilized community. I n the district which,47
NA,I have fche honour to represent there is a,47
NA,"place called Bodangara, the residents of",47
NA,which are urgently in need of a post-office..,47
NA,"The population is a large one, and yet fche",47
NA,people are compelled to obtain their corre-,47
NA,spondence through the medium of a general,47
NA,store. The tradespeople complain thafc all,47
NA,their business orders are transmitted by,47
NA,"telephone, and repeated aloud in the store.",47
NA,"That is an undesirable state of affairs,",47
NA,whichfcheGovernment seem desirous of per-,47
NA,"petuating, because whilst the inspector re-",47
NA,commended some time agofchafca separate,47
NA,"post-office should be erected, no steps have",47
NA,yet been taken in that direction. I trust,47
NA,that the Attorney-General will bring these,47
NA,matters under the notice of the Postmaster-,47
NA,"General, with a view to providing the dis-",47
NA,"tricts I have mentioned with facilities which,",47
NA,are urgently needed.,47
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Parramatta) - I,47
NA,sympathize with the honorable member who-,47
NA,"has just resumed his seat. Indeed, anyone",47
NA,who is acquainted with the postal and tele-,47
NA,graphic conditions obtaining in New South,47
NA,Wales at the present time must do so. . I f,47
NA,honorable members from the other States,47
NA,are satisfied with the present administra-,47
NA,"tion of that Department, either they are",47
NA,very easily' satisfied or grave distinctions,47
NA,are being made in the treatment meted out,47
NA,to fche different States. Ifc is a singular,47
NA,circumstancefchafcnearly all fche complaints,47
NA,regarding this Department come from,47
NA,New South Wales. The representatives,47
NA,of other States are apparently able to,47
NA,"get their grievances remedied, but ifc is like",47
NA,running one's head against a brick wall fco,47
NA,the get anything done in New South Wales. I,47
NA,would remind fche honorable member for,47
NA,"Robertson that, so far as the Postal De-",47
NA,"partment is concerned, the net result of.",47
NA,"-federation has been to put'fche Ministerfar off,""",48
NA,whilst Heaven is very high. We were told,48
NA,by the Attorney-General i n his glowing,48
NA,periods thab with* centralized control we,48
NA,would secure greater efficiency. But that,48
NA,"-efficiency has not yet. been realized. Indeed,",48
NA,the net result of federation in this Depart-,48
NA,ment seems to have been the evolution of a,48
NA,stamp which no one save the Postmaster-,48
NA,General is able to appreciate. I read this,48
NA,morning that he was in a glowing state of,48
NA,"fervour over the beauties of that stamp,",48
NA,and was wondering why he was born,48
NA,"into a world which needed, as this world",48
NA,"undoubtedly does, to be set right artistically.",48
NA,That stamp is one of the results of the,48
NA,-centralized control of thePost-officefor which,48
NA,"we ought to be profoundly thankful. I t is,",48
NA,".however, a poor set-off against the continued",48
NA,neglect of postal matters in New South,48
NA,Wales. Again I complain of the seeming,48
NA,ineptitude of some of the departmental,48
NA,-officers. I am afraid that much Ministerial,48
NA,trouble arises from neglect to look after,48
NA,these oflicers. We are told that the reason,48
NA,why the cash guarantee system has been,48
NA,initiated in New South Wales is that that-,48
NA,"State, during a long course of years, made a",48
NA,few bad debts. I acknowledge .freely that,48
NA,-during my term of office as Postmaster-,48
NA,"General there, I made some of those bad",48
NA,-debts. I would do the same thing again.,48
NA,"The Post-office is a business Department,",48
NA,.and as such i t must be prepared to incur'a,48
NA,few bad debts in the multiplication and ex-,48
NA,pansion of its agencies.,48
Sir JOHN FORREST ,Bu t surely we must,48
NA,not lose money?,48
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,If c is quite cer-,48
NA,tain that the present Government will fche,48
NA,make no bad debts i n the Postal Department,48
NA,because i t has practically stopped all,48
NA,undertakings. I t is as impossible to promerits,48
NA,cure telephonic communication between,48
NA,two points now as i t is toflyto the,48
NA,Tliere will be no bad debts incurred by the,48
NA,Postmaster-General ; but there is a sad is,48
NA,side to the picture in the fact that the,48
NA,people of - the continent are deprived of the,48
NA,"ordinary telephonicfacilities, which are be",48
NA,spreading' asrapidly aspossible in every,48
NA,"other part offcheworld, afc a time when -they",48
NA,most need - them. I venture to say thafc,48
NA,since the introduction of these cash that,48
NA,guarantees there have not been a dozen,48
NA,lines constructed throughout the Commonbefore,48
NA,wealth. The present method is nofc-calcharge,48
NA,culated tolead to any expansion of been,48
NA,business. I t is rather a way not tci,48
NA,make^ the Post-office pay; For some time,48
NA,past I have been'criticising the Postmaster-,48
NA,General seemingly without effect. He is,48
NA,away i nfche'cloistered seclusion of another,48
NA,"place, and'-we can say nothing to him except",48
NA,through the medium of another Minister.,48
NA,Thafc honorable gentleman invariably tells,48
NA,us that he will communicate all our criti-,48
NA,"cisms to thePostmaster-General, and there",48
NA,is an end to them. A very grave wrong,48
NA,was committed by this Government when,48
NA,they placed the Postmaster-General in the,48
NA,"other Chamber, which has not the direct",48
NA,relations-with him that this House has. The,48
NA,members of this Chamber represent the,48
NA,State electorates. I t is to us that appli- 1,48
NA,cations are made in connexion withpostal,48
NA,andtelegraphic wants. Yefc we can address,48
NA,the Minister only through the medium of,48
NA,another Minister. That is the initial,48
NA,"trouble, and even at this late period i t",48
NA,ought to be remedied as soon as possible.,48
NA,"The other day I ""asked for a return of the",48
NA,bad debts incurred in NewSouth Wales;,48
NA,about which we have heard so much. We,48
NA,are told fchafc in that State the sum -of,48
NA,"£8,000 had to be written off. I want a",48

NA,further; are we to be prevented from dis-,48

NA,sume that for all time hereafter the Minister,49
NA,will plead that the Goldring case is sub,49
NA,"judice, because once i n 1903 i t was held",49
NA,be so.,49
Mr DEAKIN , I f Goldring withdraws his,49
NA,action we will lay the whole of the papers,49
NA,upon the table to-morrow.,49
Mr JOSEPH COOK , Goldring has same,49
NA,taken no action.,49
Mr DEAKIN ,H e has informed me that,49
NA,he intends to do so;,49
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Whe n will this,49
NA,bar to the discussion of the matter be,49
NA,moved ? I f Goldring has endeavoured to,49
NA,"defraud the Customs Department, honorable",49
NA,members will acclaim the Minister for,49
NA,"ting, the law in motion. But irrespective",49
NA,"whether or not the case is sub judice, statethe",49
NA,ments have been made as to simple matters,49
NA,"of fact which have aggravated it, and as",49
NA,which any explanation would not prejudice,49
NA,"its merits. Por example, why has not",49
NA,Goldring been able to obtain replies to,49
NA,"his correspondence ? Why, the greatest",49
NA,-criminal'in the country is entitled to receive,49
NA,an answer. But not a word can be got out,49
NA,of the Department in this connexion. applaud,49
NA,"Strange to say, the Attorney-General's",49
NA,partment is pervaded with the same tired,49
NA,feeling that is to be found in the Customs,49
NA,partment. The honorable gentleman declares,49
NA,that steps were taken promptly by the,49
NA,net to allow Goldring to prosecute his claim.,49
NA,But i t was nine days after the Cabinet,49
NA,decided to name a nominal defendant before,49
NA,this man received the paper:,49
Mr DEAKIN ," I t was six days, a n d",49
NA,have learned since where the blame rests.,49
NA,The blame does not rest with the Attorneyto,49
NA,General's Department. On looking up,49
NA,"papers, I find that on the day we received",49
NA,the document i t was forwarded to Mr.,49
NA,Goldring. Tlie delay lies somewhere beI,49
NA,tween the Executive Council and the,49
NA,"Attorney-General's Department,'but not",49
NA,"the latter, I am happy to say.",49
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,The n i t took six,49
NA,days for a .simplepaper to go from the,49
NA,Executive Chamber to the Attorney-GeneThese,49
NA,ral's Department?.,49
Mr DEAKIN , Apparently; but,49
NA,Governor-General had been in Sydney.,49
Mr JOSEPH COOK, -I f I were at the',49
NA,head of the Attorney-General's Department,49
NA,some one would have*-to-answer for such,49
NA,scandalous state of affairs. I t is,49
NA,I prethesame sort ofthing multiplied inde-,49
NA,finitely through the Customs Department,49
NA,that is making i t impossible to get business,49
NA,to attended to there. Surely such delays are,49
NA,not necessary in order to guard the revenue,49
NA,"of the country, or to see that criminals do",49
NA,not escape. A l l the requisite steps could,49
NA,"be taken to protect the revenue, and at the-",49
NA,time observe the ordinary courtesies of,49
NA,business life. I t was because of the delays,49
NA,and the absence of answers to letters that,49
NA,"Mr Goldring was, in the first instance, com-",49
NA,pelled to go to law. He could come to no,49
NA,reother conclusion tban that the Department,49
NA,"! was treating him with absolute contempt,-",49
NA,j and he did what any other man of spirit,49
NA,setwould have done-h e went for redress to,49
NA,of [ the law courts. These are matters within,49
NA,"control of Ministers, who ought to see",49
NA,that the clerks of their Departments attend,49
NA,to to the correspondence work as they would,49
NA,be compelled to do if employed by any,49
NA,Mr ordinary business firm. I t seems to me,49
NA,that this House will tolerate almost any-,49
NA,thing in connexion with the Minister for,49
NA,"Trade and Customs, because he now and then",49
NA,"wins a case in court. We only hear of, and",49
NA,"him for, the cases he wins; we never",49
NA,Dehear anything about the cases hi which'his,49
NA,"action amounts to right down oppression,",49
NA,Deand Consequent ruin to the people who come,49
NA,under his administration - I am not blam-,49
NA,"Cabiing the Minister personally, but he must",49
NA,be held responsible for the conduct of his,49
NA,had officers; and a drastic revolution in the,49
NA,methods of hisoffice would obviate many,49
NA,of the troubles which are so irritating to-,49
NA,the people concerned. I applaud the M i n -,49
NA,' I ister for hunting down fraud-; but people,49
NA,"in matters affecting their business, and, so",49
NA,"speak, their very life; are at least en-",49
NA,the titled to ordinary courtesy. Like other,49
NA,"honorable'members, I.have grievances which",49
NA,"I should like to bring before the -House, but",49
NA,do not intend to touch on them to-night.,49
NA,I recognise that we must deal .with tbe,49
NA,"in Judiciary Bill, which is regarded as a.",49
NA,matter of superior importance. But I,49
NA,thought I heardi a voice from-'Corio utter-',49
NA,"ing the words'^"" Besponsible Government.""",49
NA,words seem to have a strange sound,49
NA,in an Assembly like this. They strike,49

NA,tha* i n thesedays we are still following the,49
NA,- 1,49
NA,constitutional lines followed by our fore-,50

NA,"rate, the words ""Responsible Government""",50
NA,have a strange sound in the Pederal Parlia-,50
NA,"ment, where there has been no evidence of",50
NA,the principle up to date. The latest evi-,50
NA,dence of an utter and total disregard of the,50
NA,principle lies in the fact that a measure like,50
NA,the Judiciary Bill,50
Mr SPEAKER ,Th e honorable member,50
NA,must not discuss the Judiciary Bill at pre-,50
NA,sent.,50
Mr JOSEPH COOK , I am not going,50
NA,"to discuss the Judiciary Bill, but merely to",50
NA,refer to i t as evidence of Ministerial delin-,50
NA,quencies.,50
Mr SPEAKER ,S o long as the honor-,50
NA,able member goes no further he is entitled,50
NA,to do that.,50
Mr JOSEPH COOK ,Minister s have,50
NA,declared that the Judiciary Bill is vital to the,50
NA,"Constitution, and that i t is mandatory, by",50
NA,"the direct voice and vote of the people, to",50
NA,create a High Court at the earliest possible,50
NA,moment. Surely this is a matter in which,50
NA,Ministers should feel responsibility; but how,50
NA,have they allowed the measm-e to be treated,50
NA,oy the House ? Do we see any evidence of,50
NA,that keen and delicate sense of responsibility,50
NA,of which we heard so much in the olden days 1,50
NA,The honorable member to whom I have re-,50
NA,ferred had better wake up and find that,50
NA,"Ministerial reponsibility, in the Pederal",50
NA,"Parliament at any rate, is a dead aud done-",50
NA,"for thing, and will remain so until we have",50

NA,altogether agree with the phraseology of,50
NA,"the amendment, but i t has the merit of",50

NA,hesitate a long time before askingfcheComexcept,51

Mr CONROY ,No . When Parliament is,52
NA,"not sitting, the seat of government may be",52

Mr CROUCH , I hold that i t is an,52

NA,from Melbourne. He very rarely comes,52
NA,here. He spends a great deal of his time,52

Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) -Does,52

Mr DEAKIN , W i t h regard to the,52

NA,"honorable and learned member for Corinella,",52
NA,I desire to say that district registries will,52

NA,"diction of the High Court has been reduced,",52
NA,the work of ths States officers who will be,52

NA,"connexion with circuit work, but having re-",52
NA,gard to the fact that the business of the,52
NA,court will be confined almost wholly to the,52
NA,"the At- hearing of appeals, there will be no need",52
NA,for the Judges to waste their time in,52
NA,travelling about. I suggest that we should,52
NA,provide that the courts should sit at such,52
NA,places as the Governor-General may appoint.,52
NA,"Of course, i t will be understood that the",52
NA,Governor-General will fix the places of,52
NA,sitting as the Judges may recommend. I f,52
NA,"the clause is passed in its present form, the",52
NA,Judges may feel constrained to hold sittings,52
NA,"wherever there is a district registry,",52
NA,whether there is any business to transact,52
NA,or not.,52
Mr DEAKIN , T h e words at the end,53
NA,"of the clause might be altered to read ""and",53
NA,may be held at any place at which there is,53
NA,"a district registry."" That would involve",53
NA,less alteration than the suggestion of the,53
NA,honorable and learned member.,53
Mr ISAACS , I n d i ) - I do not think,53
NA,there is very much trouble to be apprehended,53
NA,"under the clause as i t stands, because of the",53
NA,"saving words, "" as is required."" The court",53
NA,will not sit at any of the places at which,53
NA,"there is a district registry, unless tliere is",53
NA,business that will require them to do so.,53
Mr HIGGINS , I can conceive that the,53
NA,Judges would feel constrained to sit at each,53
NA,"place at which there is a district registry,",53
NA,and I think i t would be much better to,53
NA,amend the clause in fche manner I suggest.,53
NA,I therefore move-,53
NA,"- That all the words after the word ""time,""",53
NA,"2, be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu",53
NA,"thereof the words ""at such place",53
NA,"vernor-General may prescribe.""",53
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) - I think i t,53
NA,would be advisable to make fche clause as,53
NA,"elastic as possible, because there is a good",53
NA,deal of force in the view taken by the honor-,53
NA,able and learned member for Northern Mel-,53
NA,bourne. We may not be able to accommo-,53
NA,date our Judges with any degree of comfort,53
NA,"at the federal capital for some timefcocome,",53
NA,and yet ifc is required that the court shall,53
NA,be held from time to time at the principal,53
NA,seat of the court. I shall support fche,53
NA,amendment.,53
Mr ISAACS ,Indi) - I would ask the,53
NA,honorable and learned member for Northern,53
NA,Melbourne whether the amendment would,53
NA,nofc be to some extent contradictory to what,53
NA,we have already done. I n clause 10 ifc is,53
NA,provided thafc there shall be a principal,53
NA,registry of fche High Court which shall be,53
NA,at the principal seat of the court. Thafc is,53
NA,compulsory. I t is also provided thafc there,53
NA,shall be district registries at tbe capitals of,53
NA,the States. Power is also fco taken to ap-,53
NA,point other places i f necessary. I f the,53
NA,whole of Australia is to bear the expense,53
NA,"connected with the High Court, I think",53
NA,that i t should be understood that the High,53
NA,Court is to sit in each capital at some time,53
NA,"or other, i f required. The matter should",53
NA,not be left i n such an indefinite form that,53
NA,i t might be considered sufficient if tlie,53
NA,Governor-General appointed the two larger,53
NA,capitals as fche places of sitting for fche,53
NA,court.,53
Mr WINTER COOKE ,Wannon) - I,53
NA,quite agree with the honorable and learned,53
NA,"member for Indi, and - I think 'it is un-",53
NA,desirable fco make any amendments in fche,53
NA,clause unless very good reasons are shown.,53
NA,I t is to be assumed that the court will sit,53
NA,only when and where ifc may be necessary,53
NA,for i t to transact business.,53
Mr GLYNN ,South Australia) - I was,53
NA,struck by the same point as fche honorable,53
NA,"and learned member for Indi, namely, that",53
NA,the effect of the proposed amendment would,53
NA,be to make i t optional with fche Covernor-,53
NA,General fco say whether the High Court,53
NA,should sit afc a district registry or not;,53
NA,"whereas under clause 10, ifc is provided that",53
NA,"the court must sit a* required, wherever",53
NA,there is a district registry. The honorable,53
NA,and learned member for Northern Mel-,53
NA,bourne could effect his object by striking,53
NA,"line out all the words after the word "" and""",53
NA,and adding afc the end of fche clause those,53
NA,as the Gowhich he proposes to insert.,53
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne) -,53
NA,Under the clause as i t stands i t is compul-,53
NA,sory for the courtfcohold sittings nofc only,53
NA,"afc the principal seat, but at every place",53
NA,"where there is a district registry, as re-",53
NA,quired. The court would consider that,53
NA,they were bound to hold sittings i n every,53
NA,"place where was a district registry, and in",53
NA,"the event of an appeal case arising in Perth,",53
NA,"for instance, they would regard ifc as their",53
NA,duty to travel to that city in order to hold,53
NA,", a court. We should not encourage this",53
NA,travelling about any more than we-can pos-,53
NA,sibly help. Although I adhere to the posi-,53
NA,tion that we shall be imposing an obligation,53
NA,"on fche Judges to hold sittings to no purpose,",53
NA,the Committee do not appear to agree with,53
NA,"me, and therefore I shall withdraw the",53
NA,amendment.,53
NA,"Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",53
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) - I think,53
NA,that this clause is worthy of more considera-,53
NA,tion than has been bestowed upon i t . To my,53
NA,mind its provisions should be made more,53
NA,elastic. Perhaps i n twelve months' time,53
NA,an argument will be founded upon i t for the,53
NA,appointment of additional Judges. I could,53
NA,quite understand the honorable and learned,53
NA,member for I n d i using ifc forfchafcpurpose i f,53
NA,he were arguing against the view which he,53
NA,now indorses. The more I look afc fchis,53
NA,"provision, the more I can see the force of the",53
NA,contention of the honorable and learned,53
NA,member for Northern Melbourne.,53
Mr HIGGINS , I t is an excuse for pro-,54
NA,viding the Judges with work when there,54
NA,is' none.,54
Mr CONROY ,Exactly .,54
Mr ISAACS ,Doe s fche honorable and,54
NA,learned member suggest thafc the High,54
NA,court ought fco sifc afc one place in Australia,54
NA,only ?,54
Mr CONROY ,The places at which it,54
NA,shall sit should be determined by the Judges,54
NA,"themselves, with the advice of the Execufci ve.",54
NA,"If a case does arise in a certain State, the",54
NA,court ought to be prepared to go there if,54
NA,necessary. But I would point out thafc in,54
NA,some instances its members would have to,54
NA,start travelling a week before they were,54
NA,aware tbat any cases were set down for,54
NA,hearing. Take fche experience of fche States,54
NA,Circuit Courts. Frequently up fco almost,54
NA,bhe day prior to the holding of these courts,54
NA,no cases are listed. Then two or three,54
NA,brought forward almost at the last moment.,54
NA,"The fact is, that endeavours are usually",54
NA,made by both sides to effect a settlement so,54
NA,as to avoid the expense of the parties going,54
NA,into court. If we allow the clause to,54
NA,"stand in its present form, who can say",54
NA,that the court will not be required to sit at,54
NA,any of the other State capitals 1,54
Mr MCCAY ,Th e court ought to deter-,54
NA,mine where i t should sit.,54
Mr CONROY ,Th e court should only,54
NA,determine i t subject to the consent of the,54
NA,Executive Council. I have not the slightest,54
NA,doubt that within fche next two years fchis,54
NA,very clause will be used by certain honorable,54
NA,members to support an argument i n favour,54
NA,of fche appointment of additional Judges. I,54
NA,trust that the honorable and learned mem-,54
NA,ber for Northern Melbourne will press his,54
NA,amendment.,54
Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) -Surel y the,54
NA,"Committee, having divided several times",54
NA,upon matters of grave importance in this,54
NA,"Bill, is not going to vote upon a matter of",54
NA,this kind. I think that the clause isi n,54
NA,"proper form. The words "" is required """,54
NA,"cover all the contingencies feared, and if the",54
NA,High Court-irrespectiv e of whether ifc is,54
NA,constituted of three Justices or more-can -,54
NA,not be trusted to control its own business,54
NA,"without abusing its powers, i t certainly can-",54
NA,not be intrusted with the interpretation of,54
NA,the Constitution.,54
NA,Clause agreed to.,54
NA,Postponed clauses 12 to 15 agreed to. ',54
NA,Postponed clause .16-,54
NA,The jurisdiction of the High Court may be,54
NA,exercised by a Justice sitting in chambers in the,54
NA,cases following:-,54
NA,(a) Applications relating to the conduct of a,54
NA,cause or matter;,54
NA,"(6) Applications relating to fche custody, man-",54
NA,"agement or preservation of property, or",54
NA,to tbe sale of property and the disposi-,54
NA,tion of the purchase money ;,54
NA,(c) Applications for orders or directions as to,54
NA,any matter which by this Act or by,54
NA,rules of court is made subject to tbe,54
NA,* direction of a Justice sitting in cham-,54
NA,bers ;,54
NA,{d) Any other applications which by this or,54
NA,any Act or by rules of court are,54
NA,authorized to be made to a Justice sit-,54
NA,ting in chambers.,54
NA,But on tho application of either party the Jus-,54
NA,tice may order the application to be adjourned,54
NA,into court and heard iu open court.,54
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne).,54
NA,"-Thi s clause needs revision, owing to thp",54
NA,are changes which have been made in the Bill.,54
NA,"I t provides, amongst other things, that the",54
NA,High Court may exercise jurisdiction by a,54
NA,"Justice sitting in chambers, i n applications",54
NA,"relating to fche custody, management, or",54
NA,"preservation of property, or to the sale of -",54
NA,property and the disposition of the pur-,54
NA,chase money. That drags into the cogni-,54
NA,zance of tlie High Court ordinary equitable,54
NA,applications.,54
Mr DEAKIN , Only upon matters of,54
NA,Federal jurisdiction.,54
Mr HIGGINS ,Suppos e that in fche,54
NA,course of a mortgage suit involving,54
NA,"£100,000 there was a single question of £ 5 0",54
NA,which was affected by the Federal law.,54
NA,The whole of thafc particular action could be,54
NA,dragged before the High Court. Th6,54
NA,original idea was that fche High Court,54
NA,should have original jurisdiction in a host,54
NA,of matters in which i t has been deprived of,54
NA,that jurisdiction. There are two kinds of,54
NA,"functions which courts perform, first, the",54
NA,"awarding of damages, and secondly the",54
NA,administration of property. This clause,54
NA,involves questions of the administration of,54
NA,property. I cannot conceive of any case,54
NA,being brought before the HighCourt,54
Mr MCCAY ,Supposin g there is a suit,54
NA,between residents of different States 1,54
Mr HIGGINS ,Thes e matters are nofc,54
NA,dealt; with in chambers in the States Supreme,54
NA,Courts. They are dealt with i n open court,54
NA,by petition or upon motion. To my mind,54
NA,"we ought not to allow these applications,,",54
NA,which may involve an infant's whole patri-,54
NA,"mony, fco be entertained anywhere but in.",54
NA,open court. Why should this power be,55
NA,"given to the High Court, seeing that",55
NA,that tribunal is now only a Court of,55
NA,Appeal. I fail to see any distinction,55
NA,between paragraphs (c) and (d) of this,55
NA,clause. To my mind they traverse the,55
NA,same ground. I think that this chamber,55
NA,jurisdiction might very well be allowed to,55
NA,stand over till we know what the other,55
NA,machinery of the court is to be. I t has been,55
NA,suggested that this provision is intended to,55
NA,provide for suits between residents of,55
NA,"different States, but I can hardly conceive",55
NA,of there being any need for an application,55
NA,"for the custody or sale of property. Further,",55
NA,why should we allow the High court to do,55
NA,in chambers what fche other courts have to,55
NA,do in the open ? There is no class of applica-,55
NA,tion in which so much hanky-panky can be,55
NA,played as that having reference to the pro-,55
NA,perty of helpless infants. As fche High,55
NA,Court is endowed with only a very slight,55
NA,"original jurisdiction, these matters might",55
NA,well be dealfc with in the ordinary way upon,55
NA,motion.,55
Mr DEAKIN , T h e honorable and,55
NA,learned member for Northern Melbourne has,55
NA,correctly stated thafc fche alteration i,55
NA,jurisdiction which has been made will cer-,55
NA,tainly deprive the High Court of the great,55
NA,bulk of the original jurisdiction work thafc,55
NA,would have been transacted there. I do,55
NA,know thafc under any circumstances i t was,55
NA,"likely to have been large, but I confess that",55
NA,i t will now be much smaller.,55
NA,"may be rarely exercised, the power conferred",55
NA,"by this clause is a convenient one to have,",55
NA,especially i f ifcberead in conjunction with,55
NA,provisions which I purpose asking the Comifc,55
NA,mittee to substitute for the next clause. I,55
NA,"isfchesame in effect, though different",55
NA,form. I t provides-,55
NA,"1. The Supreme Court of a State shall, subject",55
NA,"to any rules of court, be invested with",55
NA,"jurisdiction, to hear and determine at the request",55
NA,"of the Chief Justice, any applications in matters",55
NA,pending in the High Court which may be made,55
NA,before a Justice of the High Court sitting,55
NA,chambers.,55
NA,2. Such jurisdiction may be exercised by,55
NA,single Judge of the Supreme Court sitting,55
NA,chambers.,55
NA,I have submittedfchisproposal as an alternaWe,55
NA,tive to the clause in the Bill. The object,55
NA,"if i t be possible, and I think i t is, to",55
NA,fchafc under certain circumstances a Judge,55
NA,the Supreme Court of a State may underhe,55
NA,take some subordinate or ancillary,55
NA,"proper to be dealt with i n chambers, and",55
NA,may be deputed to do so in order to avoid a,55
NA,visit to a particular district or capital of,55
NA,one of the Federal Justices. I think the,55
NA,honorable and learned member will see thafc,55
NA,i t would be a very convenient arrangement.,55
NA,"I am willing to admit, however, that this",55
NA,power has necessarily been deprived of much,55
NA,"of the value i t would otherwise have had,",55
NA,by the extreme rarity of the necessity that is,55
NA,now likely to arise of making any such,55
NA,demands. Still the fact that fche power,55
NA,may be required or exercised only,55
NA,"on few occasions, is no reason why",55
NA,this provision should not be made.,55
NA,No additional jurisdiction is conferred; ifc is,55
NA,simply a convenient mode of dealing with,55
NA,minor interlocutory matters. Those ques-,55
NA,tions are scarcely of fche nature which the,55
NA,honorable and learned member has suggested,55
NA,that may hereafter arise' when Common-,55
NA,"wealth legislation relatesfcoinfants, parental",55
NA,"rights, and other subjects on which legisla-",55
NA,tion is possible. Then this business may be-,55
NA,come of some importance; but afc the pre-,55
NA,sent time its intention is to provide for,55
NA,ancillary and minor matters.,55
Mr HIGGINS ,Th e provision will compel,55
NA,n the the court to have a Chief ' Clerk or some,55
NA,' officer qualified to sell property and apply,55
NA,purchase money-if c means more officials.,55
Mr DEAKIN ," I think not, though ifc",55
NA,not means the use of more State officials.,55
Mr ISAACS , I doubt i t very much.,55
NA,Ifc is only doing in chambers what the court,55
NA,Although ifc otherwise would do.,55
Mr DEAKIN , T h e fact that the power,55
NA,"w i l l. be little used, may be thought an",55
NA,"the argument in its favour. When i t is used,",55
NA,will mean a saving of expense and of time,55
NA,"t and travelling, even if i t is only of a single",55
NA,in Judge ; and these considerations are worth,55
NA,weighing.,55
Mr HIGGINS ,Northern Melbourne).,55
NA,Federal - M y idea is that the power will mean,55
NA,expense in the employment of more officials;,55
NA,andfchafcis what we ought to try to avoid.,55
NA,in I think I speak with more experience than,55
NA,any one here in regard to this particular,55
NA,a class of work ; and I repeat that if we adopt,55
NA,in more administrative machinery for fche High,55
NA,Court i t means more administrative oflicers.,55
NA,cannot have applications for the sale and,55
NA,"is, administration of property without having",55
NA,provide an officer qualified for the purpose. Of,55
NA,"of course, the Attorney-General will say that",55
NA,intends to obtain the services of the,55
NA,matters Chief Clerk of a States Court.,55
Mr DEAKIN ,Som e such officer.,55
Mr HIGGINS ," I t may, or may nofc,",56
NA,possible to obtain the offices of such an,56
NA,officer. The Chief Clerk of the States,56
NA,Court may say thafc he is busy with State,56
NA,work ; there may arise a conflict between,56
NA,his duty to the State and his duty to the,56
NA,"Commonwealth, and eventually we shall be",56
NA,driven to employing such an officer.,56
Mr MCCAY ,Would it make any differplied,56
NA,ence in the number of officers if these mat-,56
NA,ters were dealt with in chambers instead of,56
NA,in open court 1,56
Mr HIGGINS ,Tha t is another point,56
NA,altogether. The proposal as to hearing,56
NA,these applications in chambers is a novelty,56
NA,"to me, and I think i t would be better to",56
NA,follow the ordinary course of hearing them,56
NA,in open court.,56
Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) -If c does nofc,56
NA,"seem to mefcomake any difference, so far",56
NA,as the officials beyond the Judges are con-,56
NA,"cerned, whether the applications are made",56
NA,in court or in chambers. The power will,56
NA,"be i n the court, consisting of either a single",56
NA,"Judge or three Judgesfcomake those orders,",56
NA,".and if the power is there, the necessary",56
NA,officials beyond the Judges will be required.,56
NA,But there would be a Saving of time and ex-,56
NA,pense by allowing the applications to be,56
NA,"made in chambers to the Judge, instead of",56
NA,to a court consisting of one or more Judges.,56
Mr CONROY ,Does not paragraph (6) go,56
NA,further and give original jurisdiction 1,56
Mr MCCAY ,N o i the clause begins-,56
NA,"""The jurisdiction of the High Court may",56
NA,be exercised . . . in the cases,56
NA,"ing."" I f apart from clause 16 there was",56
NA,no jurisdiction to do what is mentioned in,56
NA,"paragraph (b), the clause would not of itself",56
NA,"give any additional jurisdiction, and conse-",56
NA,quently fche abolition of the power to hear,56
NA,applicants in chambers would not save a,56
NA,single farthing or a single officer. I may,56
NA,point out that i f there is any suspicion of,56
NA,""" hanky-panky,"" the matter can be adjourned",56
NA,into open court.,56
Mr GLYNN ,South Australia) -Suc h,56
NA,cases as have been .referred to will not very,56
NA,"often arise, because the original jurisdiction",56
NA,has been cut down ; but the power may be,56
NA,required under section 75 of the Consti-,56
NA,tution.,56
Mr ISAACS ,I t may be required in some,56
NA,appellate cases.,56
Mr GLYNN , I t may be required in an,56
NA,"application to a Judge for a new trial, and",56
NA,I do nofc know why we should not allow,56
NA,"-such applications, where new evidence has",56
NA,"be been discovered, without the necessity of",56
NA,bringing the matter before the Pull Court,56
NA,"of three Judges. I n a question of law,",56
NA,three Judges would be necessary ; but in a,56
NA,"case of mistake, or where more evidence had",56
NA,"been obtained, a single Judge might be",56
NA,sufficient. A mandamus isnot a matter,56
NA,"which can be waited for, and i f one is ap-",56
NA,for under section 75 of the Constitu-,56
NA,"tion against fche Commonwealth, ifc might",56
NA,be expedient to grant ifc in some cases in,56
NA,chambers. Thafc can be done in some of,56
NA,"the States, and I think ifc should be possible",56
NA,in all.,56
Mr CONROY ,Werriwa) -Af c first I,56
NA,was inclined to agree with the honorable,56
NA,and learned member for Northern Mel-,56
NA,"bourne, but now I think that tlie distinction",56
NA,pointed out by the honorable and learned,56
NA,member for Corinella is sufficient. A l l that,56
NA,Justices sitting in chambers can do is,56
NA,merely that which can be done in the High,56
NA,Court in certain cases; sub-paragraph (6),56
NA,does not give any power beyond that which,56
NA,fche Full Court has.,56
Mr HIGGINS ,Ma y I ask the Attorney-,56
NA,General for an explanation of paragraphs (c),56
NA,and (d) ?,56
Mr DEAKIN ,Paragrap h (c) applies,56
NA,to cases in which an. application may be,56
NA,made for an order or special direction. But,56
NA,there are cases i n which applications of,56
NA,another sort may be made; and fco meet,56
NA,those cases paragraph (d) is inserted. No,56
NA,"order or direction may be expected, but the",56
NA,followcourt is made acquainted at some stage,56
NA,"with interlocutory matter which arises, and",56
NA,of which ifc is desirable fche court should be,56
NA,informed. Paragraph (d) is a drag-net pro-,56
NA,posal to cover anyfchingwhichis not embraced,56
NA,by other sub-clauses of an administrative,56
NA,"nature, suitable to be mentioned in cham-",56
NA,bers.,56
NA,Clause agreed to.,56
NA,Postponed clause 17 (Supreme Court,56
NA,Judges may be empowered to act as Justices,56
NA,of the High Court in chambers).,56
Mr DEAKIN , I propose to omit this,56
NA,clause with a view of substituting a new,56
NA,clause hereafter.,56
NA,Clause negatived.,56
NA,Postponed clauses 18 and 19 agreed to.,56
NA,Postponed clause 20-,56
NA,(1) The jurisdiction of the High Court fco hear,56
NA,and determine appeals from judgments-,56

NA,Court; or,56
NA,(6) of a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State,57

NA,consisting of not less than three Justices.,57
NA,(2) Appeals from judgments of any other court,57
NA,exercising Federal jurisdiction may be heard and,57

Mr DEAKIN , Honorable members,57

NA,appeals from the judgment of any. other,57
NA,court exercising Federal jurisdiction may,57
NA,"be heard and determined by fche Full Court,",57
NA,consisting of two or more Justices ; and we,57
NA,have already made the quorum in sub-clause,57
NA,2 two Justices. I suggest that we trans-,57
NA,"pose this sub-clause, and insert ifc between",57
NA,"paragraphs (6) and (c), and as sub-clause",57
NA,"(62), make i t read "" o f any other court",57

Mr ISAACS , I n d i ) - I desire the Attor-,57
NA,"ney-General fco make an alteration, which,",57
NA,"although i t may appear small, involves a",57
NA,large principle. I n paragraph (6) I sug-,57
NA,gest thafc we should strike out the first,57
NA,"three words, "" of a Judge."" There is all",57
NA,the distinction between a Judge of tbe,57
NA,Supreme Court of a State and fche Supreme,57
NA,"Court of a State, because under the Consti-",57

Mr DEAKIN , I n clause 20 we are,57

Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) -Th e provision,57
NA,"for two Judges may be left out altogether,",57
NA,because clause 19 fixes two Judges as a,57
NA,minimum; and we may make clause 21,57
NA,provide three Judges. The Attorney-,57
NA,"General, now that we have only three",57
NA,"Judges, desires tp fix the cases in which",57
NA,all the three Judges must be sitting.,57
NA,"Under clause 19, the Full Court, consisting",57
NA,"of any two or more Judges, will be entitled",57
NA,to hear any - case which under subsequent,57

Sir JOHN QUICK ,Bendigo) - I think,57

Mr GLYNN ,South Australia) - I think,57
NA,it is inexpedient to require applications for,57
NA,a now trial to be made to two Judges.,57
NA,"Of course, the original jurisdiction of the",57

NA,why an application for a new trial should,57

NA,where there was only a mistake in fact.,57
NA,The clause prevents a Judge of the Supreme,57

NA,"cations, and thus may force suitors to go fco",57
NA,the very heart of Australia to make their,57
NA,applications before the High Court. I,57
NA,think the Attorney-General might consider,57
NA,"whether i t is not possible to provide, as under",57

NA,Why should a man be allowed to appeal as,59
NA,"to the main body of a case, and not with",59
NA,regard to a specific point involved in. i t .,59
NA,This seems to be a remarkable method of,59
NA,legislating and adjusting.,59
Mr MCCAY ,Th e United States are ex-,59
NA,periencing a very similar trouble in con-,59
NA,nexion with Federal and State questions.,59
Mr HIGGINS , I have received a letter,59
NA,"on this point from a very thoughtful man,",59
NA,who says that we are making confusion worse,59
NA,confounded. I confess that I have no defi-,59
NA,"nite proposal to make, but I was hoping",59
NA,that the Attorney-General would suggest,59
NA,some way in which litigants would-be able,59
NA,to deal with these matters.,59
Mr DEAKIN , I am afraid that I can-,59
NA,not help the honorable and learned member,59
NA,much further on the road which he desires,59
NA,to travel. The section of the Constitution,59
NA,as i t stands is the result of a conflict of,59
NA,opinion between the law oflicers of the,59
NA,Crosvn in the mother country and the dele-,59
NA,gates from Australia. The desire on our,59
NA,part was to retain as far as possible the,59
NA,power of final decision for the High Court,59
NA,in all matters affecting the new Consti-,59
NA,"tution or affecting States Constitutions,",59
NA,but we were unsuccessful. The proposal,59
NA,which the Imperial Government embodied,59
NA,in the measure submitted to the House of,59
NA,Commons would have swept away fhe,59
NA,"autonomous power of the High Court, and",59
NA,what we now have is . the spar saved,59
NA,from the wreck of our ideals. I t was,59
NA,intended that i n spite of all its obvi-,59
NA,"ous difficulties and some disadvantages,",59
NA,the American practice should be followed,59
NA,"here, and that a whole judgment should",59
NA,not necessarily be suspended because i t in-,59
NA,volved a point affecting the distribution,59
NA,of constitutional powers as between the,59
NA,"Commonwealth and a State, or between",59
NA,State and State; the utmost concession we,59
NA,could obtain was that such a point should,59
NA,be separated and dealt with independently.,59
NA,That is to say if the parties to a suit,59
NA,were dissatisfied with a judgment of the,59
NA,"High Court, they might, by special leave,",59
NA,"be enabled to take the case further, but",59
NA,in regard to those constitutional matters,59
NA,5 A ISSB,59
NA,of profound interest and importance to Aus-,59
NA,"tralia, to which reference has been made, it-",59
NA,should nofc be possible to take them beyond the-,59
NA,High Court without the consent of that body -,59
NA,Where the High Court is satisfied with its-,59
NA,"own judgment, their decision cannot be-",59
NA,questioned even on appeal to the King in>.,59
NA,"Council. Whatever may be the defects of:,",59
NA,"construction oi the clause, its intention is-",59
NA,"plain, and I have not been able to consider",59
NA,any method by which we might gain further,59
NA,"ground, or to see any point upon which i t",59
NA,would be desirable for us to make a sac-,59
NA,rifice.,59
Mr CROUCH ,Th e proper course would,59
NA,be to avail ourselves of the power given in,59
NA,"the latter part of section 74, and further",59
NA,limit the subject upon which appeals can be,59
NA,made to the Privy Council.,59
Mr DEAKIN , Y e s ; that will probably,59
NA,have to be done sooner or later. I n the,59
NA,"meantime, we have taken the words of the",59
NA,Constitution and embodied them in tliis,59
NA,clause. We can only rely upon the test,59
NA,of time and experience to show how soon it-,59
NA,will be necessary for a future Parliament to,59
NA,bring order out of the disorder which to,59
NA,some extent prevails. I t is a matter of the,59
NA,"greatest difficulty, and the position at pre-",59
NA,sent is quite unsatisfactory. The Bill is,59
NA,"only an approximation to what we desire,",59
NA,"because the Constitution is defective here,",59
NA,and we must trust to the future to create,59
NA,better relations between the courts in,59
NA,this country and between our system,59
NA,and that of the mother country.,59
Mr CROUCH ,Corio) -Th e Attorney-,59
NA,General desires fco avoid the necessity for-,59
NA,"reserving the Bill for the Royal assent,",59
NA,and therefore he does not feel disposed to -,59
NA,take advantage of the power conferred by-,59
NA,section 74 of the Constitution to make laws-,59
NA,limitingfchematters in which leave to appeal,59
NA,to the Privy Council may be asked. I do,59
NA,"nofc agree with him in this regard, because",59
NA,I should like to see the High Court clothed,59
NA,with the fullest possible power. What I,59
NA,submit is this : By section 14 i t is possible,59
NA,thafc one Judge of. the High Court can,59
NA,"exercise its powers, and that being so, sec-",59
NA,tion 74 of fche Constitution provides thafc,59
NA,appeals from the High Court to the Privy,59
NA,"Council can be ordered by the High Court,",59
NA,"that is, by a single Judge;' and i f any",59
NA,limitation of this power is made by the,59
NA,"Parliament, the Governor-General has to",59
NA,reserve such legislation for the King's,59
NA,assent. I consider the requirement of the,59
NA,concurrence of three Judges is such a limita-,60
NA,"tion, and would direct the Attorney-Gene-",60
NA,ral's attention to i t .,60

NA,the public never have the same confidence,60
NA,in a court upon which a Judge sits whose,60

Mr CONROY , I think that we should,60
NA,be acting wisely by omitting the clause. I n,60
NA,certain cases ifc might be very necessary that,60
NA,agreed a single Judge should be able to sit on ap-,60
NA,peal against his own decision with the other,60
NA,two Justices.,60
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Bendigo) -I n view,60
NA,of fche limited number of Justices to be ap-,60
NA,"pointed to tbe High Court, and of its very",60
NA,"limited primary jurisdiction, i t seems to me",60
NA,there is no necessity for the retention of,60
NA,"this disqualifying provision. A t any rate,",60
NA,I think that paragraph (c) ought to be ex-,60
NA,"cised, because there is no criminal jurisdic-",60
NA,tion vested in the High Court. B u t even,60
NA,"if ifc possessed criminal jurisdiction, there",60
NA,is no reason why we should disqualify a,60
NA,"Judge, who has reserved a case for .the Full",60
NA,"Court, from sitting uponfcheBench. Under",60
NA,our State laws fche Judge of a Supreme,60
NA,"Court, who reserves a case, says, in effect-",60
NA,""" I do not give a final decision."" He is,",60
NA,"therefore, quite capable of taking an un-",60
NA,biased view of the case when ifc comes,60
NA,agreed before the Full Court. I move-,60
NA,That paragraph (c) be omitted.,60
Mr GLYNN ,South Australia) - I think,60
NA,i t would be better to omit the clause. I n,60
NA,South Australia ifc isfchepractice for Judges,60
NA,to sit in judgment from their own decisions,60
NA,"in appeal cases, and experience shows that",60
NA,their assistance have been very useful.,60
NA,They have a knowledge of the evidence,60
NA,"which has been previously given, and can",60
NA,explain points upon which there is no re-,60
NA,cord. Time after time Judges have re-,60
NA,"sentedtheir own prinid facie' decisions, so",60
NA,that no danger exists of a Justice obsti-,60
NA,"nately adhering to a hasty judgment, such",60
NA,as is necessarily given sometimes i n nisi,60
NA,<prius cases.,60
Mr ISAACS , I n d i ) - I know that there,60
NA,is a diversity of opinion upon fche matter,60
NA,which is dealt with under this clause. The,60
NA,later trend of opinion is that Judges should,60
NA,not sit upon appeals from their own de-,60
NA,"cisions, and I can see advantages-eve n",60
NA,with a Bench composed of three Justices-,60
NA,in allowing two minds to come to a con-,60
NA,clusion upon a case unhampered by the,60
NA,presence of a Judge whose decision is under,60

NA,"nature even i n Judges. Personally, I am",60
NA,inclined to leave the decision of this matter,60

NA,Constitution that-,61
NA,The judicial power offcheCommonwealth shall,61
NA,of three be vested in a Federal Supreme Court.,61
NA,I t is declared in this clause that the judicial,61
NA,"power "" shall be exercised "" by the court.",61
NA,"The word "" exercised "" not being the word",61
NA,used i n . the Constitution may be held to,61
NA,mean something more than is meant by the,61
NA,Constitution. I t is unnecessary; and why,61
NA,to put in a clause which leads to on ambiguity ?,61
NA,of I can understand why i t was put i n origi-,61
NA,nally. I t was a general declaration that,61
NA,Pederal Courts or the States Courts in-,61
NA,with Federal jurisdiction might exer-,61
Mr DEAKIN , T h e clause is a useful,61
NA,declaration. I failfcosee how there can be,61
NA,any construction of i t which would give fche,61
NA,.High Court more power than the Constitu-,62
NA,tion intends to confer. Although i t is,62
NA,"declaratory, the clause has a value of its",62
NA,-own.,62
Sir JOHN QUICK ,Bendigo) -I t seems,62
NA,/to me that this clause goes further than a,62
NA,mere declaration of what the Constitution but,62
NA,;provided. The words of the Constitution-,62
NA,The judicial power of the Commonwealbh,62
NA,-shall be vesbed in a Federal Supreme Courb bo be,62
NA,"-called bhe High Courb, and in such obher Federal",62
NA,"Courts as the Parliamenb creates, and in such",62
NA,-other courts as it invests with Federal,62
NA,- diction- -,62
NA,rshould be examined very carefully. The,62
NA,"words "" shall be vested "" mean, as I under-",62
NA,"stand them, "" shall be and is hereby vested""",62
NA,in the High Court. I t is not necessary for,62
NA,this Bil l to say that the judicial power shall,62
NA,be vested in the High Court. What is the,62
NA,"meaning of "" shall be exercised"" by the",62
NA,High Court in this clause ? The Constitu-,62
NA,tion says the High Court shall be' vested,62
NA,with judicial power. Why say-the judicial,62
NA,power shall be exercised when i t is already,62
NA,vested by the Constitution itself? I f,62
NA,we were creating other courts with a,62
NA,certain limited jurisdiction we should,62
NA,"have to define that jurisdiction, but",62
NA,the High Court is invested with jurisdiction,62
NA,by the Constitution. We have not created,62
NA,"other courts, and we do not need to say that",62
NA,.the judicial power shall be exercised by the,62
NA,High Court. There is no necessity for the,62
NA,"-.clause. . I t is only introducing confusion,",62
NA,iand may lead to unexpected results.,62
Mr MCCAY ,Corinella) -S o far as I,62
NA,"-understand the Attorney-General, he says",62
NA,-that this is a placard i n the Judiciary Bill.,62
Mr DEAKIN , Something more than,62
NA,-that; but is the honorable and learned,62
NA,member opposing i t ?,62
Mr MCCAY , I do not see the necessity,62
NA,for it. I am always afraid of unnecessary,62
NA,clauses.,62

Mr LE GROOM ,I n Queensland a bar-,63

Mr MCCAY , I am not surefchafcthis,63
NA,clause will preserve infcheFederal Courts fche,63
NA,rights that legal practitioners have under,63
NA,amalgamation in the States Courts.,63
Mr DEAKIN , I f a legal practitioner is,63
NA,entitled to practise either as a barrister or,63
NA,"as a solicitor, he is entitled to practise i n",63
NA,the Federal Court.,63
Mr MCCAY , I think the clause ought,63
NA,"to be made clearer, and that any person",63
NA,entitled to practise as a barrister or solici-,63
NA,tor in any State should have the right to,63
NA,practise as a barrister and solicitor in any,63

NA,"members of the profession, in defiance of",63
NA,the law which they are supposed to ex-,63
NA,"pound, refuse to regard the amalgamation",63
NA,as any more than a legal fiction. The whole,64
NA,tendency i n these days is towards fche amal-,64
NA,"gamation of the legal profession, with the",64
NA,right of the practitioner to specialize if he so,64
NA,chooses. I n some of the States the law in re-,64

NA,the law in regard to medical practitioners.,64
NA,I t is just about a century ago since apothe-,64
NA,caries and surgeons became merged into the,64
NA,"medical profession, in which each practitioner",64
NA,still specializes in his work. I n the United,64
NA,States we have the amalgamation of the,64
NA,legal profession i n its completeness' and,64
NA,entirety. I think that the simplest way,64

Mr DEAKIN ,"Wh y omit ""like""?",64
Mr MCCAY ,Becaus e i n New South,64

Mr DEAKIN ,Wh y should we provide,64
NA,for an extra right t What I have done is,64
NA,endeavour not to interfere with the practice,64

Mr DEAKIN , E v e r y legal practitioner,64

NA,i t would introduce into every State prac-,64

NA,"come, i t is too big a stride to take at pre-",64
Mr CROUCH ,Corio) - Unless the,64
NA,"the words "" or solicitor"" are inserted after",64

NA,"Crown Solicitor, who may be stationed at",64
NA,"the seat of government, and perhaps not",64
NA,"ablefcoattend a court at a distance, will",64
NA,have to instruct a barrister. I n many cases,64
NA,it has been the practice for the Crown to,64
NA,"instruct a solicitor, who does the work in a",64
NA,"2, the simpler manner, and at a much cheaper",64
NA,rate.,64
Mr DEAKIN , I t will be a barrister and,64
NA,solicitor who will be employed i n some,64
NA,cases.,64
Mr CROUCH ,Bu t there are States,64
NA,in which there is no amalgamation of fche,64
NA,and I think there ought to be,64
NA,the right to instruct a solicitor i n another,64
NA,State.,64
Mr DEAKIN , I t is thought thafc the,64
NA,the Crown Solicitor will act either by himself,64
NA,or by his representative i n each State ; but.,64
NA,I will consider the point.,64
Mr ISAACS ,Indi) - I do not feel,64
NA,quite satisfied with the explanation of fche,64
NA,Attorney-General. I quite agree that we,64
NA,should' not interfere with the legal profes-,65
NA,"sion in the States, but I do not .quite see",65
NA,why this privilege should be given only to,65
NA,the barrister whom the Commonwealth,65
NA,selects.,65
Mr DEAKIN ,Ther e is a possibility that,65
NA,the barrister may have appeared i n similar,65
NA,"cases in a particular State, and to employ",65
NA,him again would save instructing another,65
NA,barrister.,65
Sir JOHN QUICK , I f we have power to,65
NA,"let a barrister, appearing on behalf of the",65
NA,"Commonwealth, appear in any of the States",65
NA,"Courts, why have we not power to let all",65
NA,legal practitioners do sol,65
Mr DEAKIN , I do not say that,65
NA,"have not the power, but I think that i t is",65
NA,inexpedient to exercise i t at once.,65
Mr ISAACS , I do not see why we,65
NA,should invade the States jurisdiction even,65
NA,for this purpose. I can hardly conceive,65
NA,that i t is impossible to get i n any of the,65
NA,"States a local practitioner capable of doing,",65
NA,the work.,65
Mr DEAKIN , I t is quite possible. This,65
NA,is merely a convenience. I do not attach,65
